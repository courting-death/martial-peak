## Chapter 298 — Full of Nonsense

Fortunately, the speed of their fall had slowed significantly, so despite their awkwardness, neither of them was injured.

This struggle and resistance had actually increased Yang Kai's strength considerably.

Amidst the swirling dust, he recklessly pressed the woman beneath him, reaching out a hand to cover one of her full, soft breasts, accurately finding the protruding cherry and squeezing it wantonly.

Her red clothing was somewhat disheveled, revealing a breathtakingly pure white at her chest. The two soft breasts trembled violently, as if they were about to break free from their bindings, their elasticity astonishing.

With both hands engaged, the woman seemed to have completely lost her will to resist. Her beautiful eyes were tightly shut, her long eyelashes quivering incessantly, and her supple body twisted beneath Yang Kai, emitting suppressed moans of desire.

She seemed to have resigned herself, no longer resisting, gently cradling Yang Kai's head with her hands, pulling him up from her chest, and then blushingly pressing her red lips against his.

Yang Kai had been secretly wary of her soul-inviting fragrance, but he did not expect her to cooperate so willingly. At that moment, he no longer held back, his primal instincts surging as he kissed her.

The sweet and wonderful taste spread across his tongue. Just as he began to savor the moment, the woman suddenly opened her beautiful eyes, mischief and delight flickering within them.

Sensing something was off, Yang Kai quickly lifted his head.

"You..." He had just uttered a word when he felt the world before him turn upside down, instantly losing all sensation and collapsing onto the woman's chest.

The woman gasped for breath, calming the turbulent energy within her chest. After a moment, she regained some strength, pushed Yang Kai away from her delicate body, and slowly sat up, biting her silver teeth, her heart filled with resentment.

Before long, she suddenly burst into laughter, pouting her red lips, and murmured, "This little brat is quite skilled; he must not be a good person! Hmph, the wonders of this seat are not for just anyone to taste!"

Saying this, she stood up, adjusted her clothing, and glared hatefully at the unconscious Yang Kai on the ground, lifting him up with one hand and leaping into the air once more.

...

Yang Kai groggily awoke, feeling a sharp pain throughout his body, as if he had been pricked by needles. The surroundings were dimly lit, with only a torch slanting against a rock wall, its flame flickering.

A faint fragrance, reminiscent of orchids and musk, lingered at his nose. This scent... was somewhat familiar. It was the aroma of the enchanting woman from before; he could not tell if it was her natural scent or something she had used.

Not too strong, yet intoxicating, it also had a slight aphrodisiac effect.

Recalling that enchanting woman, Yang Kai suddenly became alert, scanning his surroundings cautiously.

He spotted the woman sitting cross-legged not far from him. Her True Essence surged violently, her eyes tightly closed, seemingly practicing some kind of technique.

Feeling his current physical condition, Yang Kai's expression darkened.

His strength had indeed recovered significantly, and his True Essence could flow freely. However, he found himself mysteriously bound in place by an unknown force, unable to move at all.

Moreover, it seemed he had been poisoned; whenever he circulated his True Essence, a dizzy sensation would wash over him, causing him to quickly calm his mind and refrain from acting recklessly.

This appeared to be a cave, not very deep, only about ten zhang in length, with Yang Kai sitting at the innermost part, while the woman blocked the exit not far away, clearly not wanting him to leave.

As he scrutinized the woman, Yang Kai could not help but admit she was extraordinarily beautiful, her allure captivating to the bone. Every part of her body seemed to have been born for the word "enchanting," especially the beauty mark beneath her eye, which made her appear irresistibly charming.

Seemingly sensing Yang Kai's brazen gaze, the woman slightly opened her eyes, her enchanting gaze filled with a hazy allure, containing a hint of springtime affection. Her cheeks were still flushed, and the breath she exhaled was hot and fervent.

"You’re awake?" The woman smiled beautifully, looking at Yang Kai with great interest.

"Hehe, sister, what do you mean by this?" Yang Kai replied nonchalantly, chuckling lightly, "You’ve imprisoned me, which is fine, but why are you blocking me?"

The woman giggled, "If I don’t block you, what if you run away?"

Yang Kai grinned, "Why would I run? The night is still young; I wouldn’t dare let my sister guard the empty chamber alone. In fact, you need not worry; just say the word, and I would gladly risk my life for you!"

The woman shot him a playful glare, recalling how he had taken liberties with her earlier, and her body inexplicably felt soft and weak, causing her to grit her teeth in anger.

Yang Kai's gaze burned with intensity as he licked his dry lips, brazenly roaming over the woman’s body, his eyes filled with unparalleled aggression, as if he wanted to strip her bare. He whispered, "To be honest, sister, I felt an instant connection with you; upon seeing you again, my heart is captivated. Why not let me go, and we can have a good chat? I truly like you; my feelings are as clear as the heavens and the earth!"

The woman could not help but giggle, her body trembling with laughter, secretly cursing this brat for his nonsense, yet her fair neck flushed slightly.

Seeing that she was not angry at all, Yang Kai grew bolder. Since things had come to this, and knowing the woman was powerful, he could not escape anyway, so he might as well see what she intended.

If she truly wanted to kill him, there would be no need to wait until now to act.

The woman gradually restrained her smile, covering her red lips with her white hand, exuding charm and allure, and softly said, "You like me... then why did you just act so roughly? Are you really willing to hurt me? What if you break me?"

Demoness! Yang Kai cursed inwardly, nearly losing his reason again.

He quickly steadied his mind, chuckling, "As the saying goes, the first time is awkward, but the second time is familiar! I am inexperienced and didn’t know how to please you earlier. I admit I was a bit abrupt, but now I have experience. I wonder if you would be interested in trying again; I guarantee you will be satisfied!"

"Little rogue!" The woman lightly bit her lip, scolding him softly, her eyes filled with a dreamy gaze.

Yang Kai's audacity was beyond anything she had ever seen, his ability to speak nonsense was truly exceptional. His skilled teasing actions were clearly not from inexperience; he was evidently a veteran in the matters of the heart, surely having ruined the purity of many young ladies.

Though she considered herself an open-minded woman, Yang Kai's blatant teasing still made her feel a bit shy. Moreover, her current state was not right; she could hardly bear to hear such words.

Just as her heart was filled with hidden resentment, she suddenly noticed Yang Kai's expression change, "Sister, are you under the influence of an aphrodisiac?"

Her condition was clearly one of rising springtime feelings, yearning for a man to relieve her inner desires, yet she had managed to endure for so long, leaving Yang Kai puzzled.

The woman was slightly taken aback, her expression becoming somewhat unnatural, forcing a smile as she replied, "You could say that, or you could say not."

"Then is it or isn't it?" Yang Kai was confused.

"Just consider it so, but this aphrodisiac is due to my own circumstances!" The woman smiled sweetly at Yang Kai, showing no intention of hiding, "It’s because I am about to break through in my cultivation method. Every time I break through, I experience this, but this time I was ambushed on my way here and sustained some injuries, so it’s more intense than before. I don’t know if I can withstand it..."

"So you brought me here?" Yang Kai suddenly realized.

Yet, a storm surged within him. What kind of cultivation method would cause a woman to feel such springtime desires during a breakthrough?

Evil technique! A definite evil technique!

It was likely a method of supplementing yin with yang!

A chill ran down Yang Kai's spine; if he were to be taken advantage of by this demoness here, his life would be too tragic.

"I was just being cautious!" The woman nodded slightly, not denying it.

At this moment, Yang Kai was bound and could not stir up any waves; she had no need to lie.

"Then why did you choose me?"

"Aside from you, there were only three old men and two women... Who else could I capture?" The woman replied with a charming smile.

Damn it, how unlucky! Why didn’t Bai Yunfeng follow me back then? If he had, I might not have been captured.

"It is my honor to serve you, sister!" Yang Kai said with a lewd smile, gazing at her deeply, "Why not stop resisting? Let’s take a break; every moment is precious."

The woman covered her mouth and giggled, scolding, "You think too highly of yourself! The cultivation method I practice is special; although I can continue cultivating even after breaking my body, once I break through before reaching completion, my cultivation speed will be greatly reduced. I am just one step away; how could I waste my efforts here?"

Yang Kai's eyes sparkled with brilliance, "So you are flawless! How wonderful! Just right, I am also a novice; we are truly a match made in heaven! You need not struggle so hard; if you truly cannot resist, just come find me!"

Yet, he was beating his heart anxiously. Although he did not know what the consequences of being taken advantage of by this woman would be, judging by the evil nature of her cultivation method, the outcome would surely not be good.

Thus, even with beauty before him, Yang Kai dared not let his thoughts wander.

The woman gazed deeply at him, a hint of regret and pity flashing in her enchanting eyes, and she trembled as she asked, "What is your name?"

"Yang Kai!"

"Yang Kai..." The woman softly repeated his name, then nodded seriously, "I remember this name. My name is Shan Qingluo!"

"That’s a beautiful name..." Yang Kai could not help but frown. This name... seemed familiar.

However, given that this woman was powerful, she was likely a renowned expert, so it was normal to have heard of her; Yang Kai did not ponder further.

"I haven’t sealed your True Essence; just keep your mind steady and don’t lose your reason!" Shan Qingluo reminded him with a smile, "Your mental fortitude is good, but I don’t know if you can withstand the temptations to come. Moreover... you better pray that I can hold on!"

"What if you can’t?" A sense of unease crept into Yang Kai's heart.

"Hehe..." Shan Qingluo chuckled lightly, not answering, her watery eyes fixed on Yang Kai for a moment, "You’re quite handsome, though you speak nonsense and are shameless; but that’s not your true nature, so I still like you a bit!"

As she spoke, her face flushed, and without giving Yang Kai time to react, she suddenly closed her eyes, her True Essence surging once more!
