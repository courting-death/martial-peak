## Chapter 215 — Cooperation (Part Two)

“Now you should understand why I said that killing in that place requires no reason or excuse, right? The blood beads obtained after killing are the best excuse and reason! There, a life is merely a stepping stone to becoming stronger, especially when you are only at the Third Stage of the Separation and Union Realm; it makes you an easy target,” Ling Taixu said in a deep voice.

Yang Kai's expression was one of shock, but more than that, he felt excitement and joy.

Ling Taixu, with his keen insight, noticed Yang Kai's expression and couldn't help but sigh inwardly, thinking that this kid was indeed going to prove his martial path through killing.

If it were any other Third Stage Separation and Union Realm martial artist who heard such things, they would likely only feel fear and try to avoid it. Yet here was Yang Kai, brimming with eagerness, wishing he could immediately rush to that place and immerse himself in endless slaughter.

There, one need not worry about harming the innocent; even if Yang Kai did not take the initiative to kill, there would be others coming to kill him. Moreover, there were many evil martial artists there, all deserving of death.

Along the way, Ling Taixu shared much information about that place with Yang Kai. After all, he had trained there many years ago and had firsthand experience, which was invaluable.

Yang Kai listened intently, not daring to miss a single detail.

According to Ling Taixu, that place was located within the Ghostly Underworld Mountain, yet it did not truly belong to the Ghostly Underworld Mountain. It was a peculiar space, and the entrance was in a lake within the Ghostly Underworld Mountain.

No one knew what kind of unique energy and heavenly rules existed inside. In any case, as long as living beings died there, their energy and flesh essence would condense into blood beads, including both humans and demonic beasts! These blood beads could be consumed directly or brought out for others to use, and they were quite valuable. Furthermore, the stronger the person or demonic beast that died, the higher the value of the blood bead, and the greater the enhancement it could provide.

Additionally, in that place, all offensive and defensive treasures would have no effect whatsoever, likely sealed by some invisible energy. Hearing this news, Yang Kai's heart sank.

With his current strength at only the Third Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, who knew how many True Essence Realm experts would flock to that place? If he encountered those experts without the assistance of the Shura Sword or the Thousand Ruyi Blood Begonia, he would surely be at a disadvantage and might even be killed.

However, thinking that others would be in the same situation brought Yang Kai some balance.

That peculiar place opened once every ten years, and Yang Kai was fortunate this time to return to the Lingxiao Pavilion just in time. If he had returned a few months later, he would have definitely missed it.

Finally, Ling Taixu solemnly handed Yang Kai a small cloth bag.

This bag was only about the size of a palm. It was engraved with many intricate patterns, made from strange materials, and looked quite exquisite.

“What is this?” Yang Kai asked in confusion.

“I call it the Spatial Pouch. Don’t be fooled by its small size; it can actually hold a vast amount of items,” Ling Taixu replied.

Yang Kai was once again moved. He looked at Ling Taixu in astonishment, not expecting that even such a legendary treasure, specifically used for storage, would be in Ling Taixu's possession.

“It was left behind by our ancestor. There is probably only one of its kind in the entire Great Han, and even your Eight Great Families in Zhongdu do not have one,” Ling Taixu said lightly.

Oh, wait, Meng Wuya might have one too, but that old fellow hoards all his treasures, giving none to anyone but his disciples. Truly petty.

“I’ve prepared some pills for you inside. Use them sparingly,” Ling Taixu advised.

“Thank you, Master! When I return, I will return this pouch to you,” Yang Kai said, carefully tucking the small pouch into his chest.

This item was indeed a supreme treasure; a treasure that could store items was something that people only heard of in legends, yet no one had ever seen one.

However, Yang Kai had a Wordless Black Book made from a Soul-Calming Stone within him, which could also be used to refine storage treasures, and its grade was certainly much higher than that of the Spatial Pouch.

Yet, Yang Kai now possessed a treasure mountain but had no idea how to utilize it, which was truly tragic.

After flying for about a day, a deep and continuous mountain range, exuding an eerie aura, appeared before Ling Taixu and Yang Kai.

The Ghostly Underworld Mountain! The only forbidden area in the Great Han! A desolate and ancient atmosphere rushed toward them, as if this forbidden area were a giant dragon that had been lying here since ancient times, sending chills down one’s spine.

As they approached the mountain, before they could even enter, two teams suddenly charged out from either side.

On the left came six individuals, and when Yang Kai looked closely, he found that they were all women. Leading them was an old woman and a beautiful matron, with the remaining four being young girls.

The four young girls wore small bells on their wrists and ankles, and as they ran, the crisp and pleasant jingling sounded like a mountain stream, refreshing to the ears.

Moreover, this group of women all possessed extraordinary beauty. The matron was regal and voluptuous, her long black hair styled into a bun, revealing her fair and slender neck, exuding a mature and alluring beauty. Especially her pair of eyes, which sparkled with autumn waves, captivating and enchanting, making the sky bluer and the flowers smell sweeter.

The four young girls were even more charming, in their prime of youth, gracefully approaching with their delicate arms half-exposed, each with skin as white as snow, rivaling frost. Their small, exquisite feet and toes outlined a unique beauty, each one smiling sweetly, some shy, some beautiful, some cold as ice, and some passionate like fire. Together, they could drive any man mad. Although the young girls’ charm was not as mature and enticing as that of the matron, they had their own fresh and captivating allure.

The old woman, though appearing very aged, still bore traces of her past beauty, which had been marred by the relentless passage of time, leaving indelible marks on her face.

This group of people stopped about thirty zhang in front of Yang Kai and Ling Taixu, the old woman casting a faint glance at the two before snorting lightly.

Clearly, those who came to the Ghostly Underworld Mountain at this time all shared the same purpose.

The entrance to that peculiar space was limited, and naturally, they were competitors.

Ling Taixu smiled slightly at the old woman and whispered to Yang Kai, “They are from the first-rate sect, Wan Hua Palace. Young man, be careful not to fall for these little girls’ tricks inside, or else you might end up with nothing left.”

Yang Kai’s eyes sparkled as he scrutinized the four young girls. Hearing Ling Taixu’s warning, he immediately straightened his expression, “Master, don’t worry, I will be careful.”

Moments later, the group on the right also arrived. Looking over, he saw that the leader was an old man of similar age to Ling Taixu, followed by three young individuals, both male and female, all possessing remarkable strength. However, regardless of gender, they all had a somewhat sinister aura.

The two young men were even more brazen than Yang Kai, their eyes nearly glued to the female disciples of Wan Hua Palace, which displeased the girls beside them, making them snort in annoyance.

“These are people from the Ghost King Valley,” Ling Taixu’s expression darkened. “You’re in trouble.”

“Why?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

“Because I had a few encounters with that old man back in the day. This is an evil sect, so be careful of their techniques,” Ling Taixu replied.

Yang Kai focused his gaze and indeed noticed that the hands of the three individuals opposite had an unusual appearance; they lacked the usual blood color and instead appeared ghostly pale, resembling terrifying claws.

The old man on the opposite side suddenly sneered, “Ling Taixu! You’re still alive!”

Ling Taixu snorted lightly, “Gui Li, you’re not dead either!”

“Good, good, good,” Gui Li grinned savagely. “I was worried you’d die and I wouldn’t find anyone to take revenge on. I didn’t expect to run into you here today; truly a blessing from the heavens.”

“What? Is the lesson from fifty years ago not enough? You’re looking to die today?” Ling Taixu coldly laughed, showing no fear.

Gui Li’s expression was twisted with malice: “Past events are meaningless to bring up again. Just because I lost to you fifty years ago doesn’t mean I will lose again fifty years later!”

“Want to give it a try?” Ling Taixu smiled proudly.

Gui Li’s eyes were as eerie as ghostly flames, staring at Ling Taixu with a hint of trepidation.

The two faced off, and the three disciples from Ghost King Valley behind Gui Li glared angrily at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned at them, his expression unchanged.

“Bang!” A sound echoed as the old woman from Wan Hua Palace struck her dragon-headed cane against the ground.

“If the two of you do not wish to fight, why don’t we discuss teaming up to enter the Ghostly Underworld Mountain?” The old woman looked at Ling Taixu and Gui Li calmly.

Although Ling Taixu and Gui Li had grievances, they did not truly want to fight at this moment. After all, they had brought people to train, and if they missed the timing, it could ruin everything. The old woman was perceptive and realized that both needed an out, which was why she suggested it.

Gui Li chuckled, “I’ll give Palace Master Yan face and let this matter go for today. Once this is over, Ling Taixu, we will definitely have a battle!”

“Anytime you wish!”

Gui Li’s gaze was cold as he scrutinized Yang Kai, showing no intention of hiding his thoughts. He turned to his three disciples and said, “Remember this kid’s appearance. Kill him once we’re inside!”

“Yes!” The three responded coldly.

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold, secretly memorizing their appearances.

With the mediation of the old woman from Wan Hua Palace, Ling Taixu and Gui Li temporarily set aside their grievances. The three quickly discussed, with the old woman leading the way, the four young girls following closely, Gui Li in the center coordinating with his three disciples. Yang Kai and Ling Taixu brought up the rear.

As for the matron, she was also in a central position, just on the opposite side of Gui Li.

With these four Divine Roaming Realm experts guarding them, the younger generation of disciples could be said to be extremely safe, provided that Ling Taixu and Gui Li did not play any tricks against each other.

Ling Taixu certainly would not be so malicious, but it was hard to say the same for Gui Li. It was precisely because of this concern that the old woman had Ling Taixu take the rear guard to prevent Gui Li from launching a sneak attack.

Fortunately, Gui Li was also a sensible person; as they traveled, he did not make any moves, honestly maintaining his position.

The Ghostly Underworld Mountain, notorious for its dangers, had everyone entering with caution, holding their breath and keeping silent, for even in the outermost areas, they might encounter powerful demonic beasts of the fifth or sixth rank.

The women from Wan Hua Palace seemed to have used some method, as the bells on their wrists and ankles made no sound at this moment. The entire group moved silently.
