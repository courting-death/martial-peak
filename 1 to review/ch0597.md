## Chapter 597 — Who Exactly Is He?

“What’s the situation with that young lady?” Shan Qingluo asked cautiously once more, her beautiful eyes glancing towards the room.

“I have some history with her. She was also the one who saved me,” Yang Kai explained casually.

“You didn’t make a move on her?” Shan Qingluo’s lips curled into a teasing smile.

“Why would I be so bored?” Yang Kai snorted, his expression growing serious again as he asked, “How is everything over at Zhongdu?”

“Everything is fine, except for your disappearance. Also, several people close to you have gone missing. Those trying to inquire about them can’t find any answers and are somewhat bewildered.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly; this situation was within his expectations.

Seeing that Yang Kai showed little sadness, Shan Qingluo immediately understood; those close to him who vanished likely weren’t in mortal danger, or else he wouldn’t look so composed.

“That day... What exactly happened beneath Zhongdu? And Yang Bai?” Shan Qingluo hesitated, nervously asking.

“It’s hard to explain in a few words,” Yang Kai said with a wry smile, unwilling to elaborate. “As for Yang Bai, he’s dead.”

“Dead?” A gleam of joy and excitement flashed in Shan Qingluo’s beautiful eyes.

“Yes, dead. I saw it with my own eyes,” Yang Kai replied with a grin.

Bilo clenched her fists, delightedly exclaiming, “What a relief!”

“Yang Bai is dead, and you’re safe. Then why haven’t you returned to Zhongdu these past six months? Why stay here instead?” Shan Qingluo looked at Yang Kai with a deep gaze. “What are you avoiding?”

“I’m not avoiding anything,” Yang Kai shook his head casually. “If I return to Zhongdu, I’ll be burdened with everything. Qiu Yimeng and the others will only see me as their pillar, losing their own initiative. Without me around, they can develop their abilities and be good family heads of the Eight Great Families.”

Moreover, Yang Kai needed time to consider matters and organize his thoughts, which is why he had been hiding overseas for over half a year.

“You want to fade from the sight of those in Zhongdu?” Shan Qingluo mused, having caught the implication in Yang Kai’s words.

“That’s one way to put it,” Yang Kai didn’t deny. “Because soon I’ll have to leave here. I gave them too much reliance; once I'm gone, it won’t be good for them.”

“Where will you go?” The Enchantress Queen immediately became anxious, for some reason. She felt that once Yang Kai left, they might never meet again. A bitter sorrow welled up uncontrollably in her heart.

“I’ll tell you when the time comes,” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “But since you came today, I should return to Zhongdu for a visit.”

He then suddenly turned his gaze to the side and said, “Elder Han Zhao, since you came, show yourself.”

Shan Qingluo smiled softly, her beautiful eyes turning in that direction, composed and calm.

Elder Han Zhao had arrived long ago, almost immediately after Shan Qingluo did. However, the sudden appearance of such a bewitching woman on Gu Yun Island made him wary, so he hid nearby to observe discreetly.

He wanted to figure out Shan Qingluo’s true identity.

But unexpectedly, she sensed his presence instantly.

Elder Han Zhao was shocked, suddenly realizing this woman’s power far surpassed his own. Otherwise, how could she have seen through his concealment at a glance? Without thinking, he immediately tried to flee.

At the same time, he emitted a sharp whistle, sending an alarm signal quickly spreading.

Yang Kai looked helpless and gave Shan Qingluo a subtle look.

Shan Qingluo pointed a finger, firing a thread of energy like a spider’s web, immediately binding Elder Han Zhao who was mid-air.

With a thud... Elder Han Zhao fell to the ground, his True Yuan trapped within his body. When he got up again, his eyes trembled violently as he stared at Shan Qingluo in disbelief, exclaiming, “Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?”

Elder Han Zhao himself had reached the seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Even top masters at its peak could not so effortlessly bind him. Only someone beyond the Divine Roaming Realm could do such a thing!

He wasn’t stupid; he instantly guessed Shan Qingluo’s true cultivation level.

Terror gripped his heart. He had no idea why this enchanting, supremely powerful woman had suddenly come to Gu Yun Island.

Yang Kai calmly walked towards him, stopping three zhang away, looking at him with an indifferent expression.

“Release him,” Yang Kai instructed the Enchantress Queen.

Shan Qingluo pouted her ruby lips, then with a thought, the spider silk binding Elder Han Zhao vanished.

Elder Han Zhao eyed Shan Qingluo warily, still uneasy but somewhat relieved sensing no hostility. After some contemplation, he asked cautiously, “May I ask who you are and what brings you to Gu Yun Island?”

“She came looking for me,” Yang Kai answered. “Elder Han Zhao, don’t be nervous; she won’t harm Gu Yun Island.”

“Looking for you?” Elder Han Zhao was dumbfounded, staring at this seemingly ordinary named disciple. His mind spun.

Since arriving at Gu Yun Island, Yang Kai had acted ordinary, showing no cultivation marks, leading Elder Han Zhao to think he was just a common fisherman. He had only agreed to let Yang Kai stay on Gu Yun Island to take care of his peacock at Zhong Miaoke’s request. But he never imagined this person could summon a top master beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

Now, this top master beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was devoted solely to him!

Who exactly was he?

Looking again at Yang Kai, Elder Han Zhao felt a vague but immense mountain-like shadow looming behind him, heavy and unstoppable.

As they spoke, the sound of fluttering garments came from a distance. It was Elder Han Zhao’s sharp whistle, summoning Gu Feng, Island Lord of Gu Yun Island, and several elders to the scene.

Gu Feng was a robust man, broad-shouldered and thick-waisted, with a fierce look. He was a peak Divine Roaming Realm cultivator. The other elders mostly cultivated to the eighth and ninth Stages of Divine Roaming Realm.

These men were the foundation of Gu Yun Island and its strongest experts.

“Elder Han Zhao, what’s happened?” Gu Feng shouted as he arrived. The elders looked alert and hostile.

Before Elder Han Zhao could answer, Gu Feng’s eyes suddenly lit up, his gaze burning as he looked at Shan Qingluo, clearly captivated. He exclaimed, “Is there really such a woman in the world?”

Not only did Gu Feng feel moved, but the other elders were also shaken, dazzled and enchanted by Shan Qingluo’s alluring and bewitching beauty; no man could resist her.

In the blink of an eye, Gu Feng laughed heartily, “Elder Han Zhao, where did you find this woman? I will take her as one of my concubines!”

Speaking, he charged toward Shan Qingluo.

“Island Lord, no!” Elder Han Zhao’s face turned green in an instant, hurrying to stop him.

Bang...

A muffled sound rang out. Before anyone could react, Gu Feng shot out like a cannonball, screaming in panic as he landed far in the nearby sea, splashing water everywhere.

No one knew how he had been struck, but they vaguely saw Shan Qingluo’s hand move.

“Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?” the elders cried in shock, horrified, no longer daring to underestimate Shan Qingluo.

Elder Han Zhao stood with mouth agape, staring at where Gu Feng fell into the water, cold sweat pouring down his forehead.

This was bad! The island lord had just flirted with a master beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. Gu Yun Island today would probably run red with blood, and the entire sect could be wiped out.

“Any elder who dares to covet my woman again won’t be just thrown out like that!” Yang Kai stepped forward, glaring coldly at Gu Yun Island’s experts.

The sound of teeth grinding filled the air. Elder Han Zhao was stunned for a moment but quickly came to his senses and said hurriedly, “Understood!”

His confusion only deepened. This young man actually called that enchanting woman his woman, and she did not deny it. What was going on?

Casting a furtive glance at Shan Qingluo, Elder Han Zhao was shocked to see her face filled with joyous happiness.

“Elder Han Zhao dares to ask, what is your purpose coming to Gu Yun Island?” Elder Han Zhao shivered, mustering courage to inquire. Since hiding on Gu Yun Island half a year ago, this person had only now shown his true fearsome face. What did he want? What on Gu Yun Island could draw such a figure’s attention?

The other elders’ hearts were also unsettled, worry filling them, and they dared not even gather courage to rescue their island lord whose fate in the sea was unknown.

“I just accidentally ended up here and don’t intend any harm to Gu Yun Island. Please rest assured, Elder Han Zhao,” Yang Kai said after a pause. “Now, I need to meet Li Yuanchun. Who among you can help bring him here?”

“Li Yuanchun?” Elder Han Zhao frowned, then suddenly realized, “Senior Li from Tai Yi Sect?”

“Yes. He should have returned to Tai Yi Sect by now?” Yang Kai asked.

“After that battle, a month later, Li Yuanchun and others from Overseas factions couldn’t find you and left Zhongdu,” Shan Qingluo whispered.

“That’s good,” Yang Kai nodded slightly, then looked again at Elder Han Zhao.

Elder Han Zhao was drenched in cold sweat. “Please forgive me, I don’t even know your true identity. How could I meet Senior Li? Moreover, the Tai Yi Sect is a great power we cannot casually tread into. Senior Li is highly respected. I’m afraid... I could not invite him. If you really want to find Senior Li, perhaps you should go to Tai Yi Sect yourself?”

He was eager to send Yang Kai away.

“You just need to tell him that Yang Kai wants to see him! Whether he comes or not is his business.”

“Should I go now?” Shan Qingluo gave him a stern look and coquettishly commanded.

“Yes...” Elder Han Zhao gritted his teeth, then took off flying in the direction of Tai Yi Sect.

The oppression here was too great. What he had seen far surpassed his understanding, and he wanted to flee quickly.

As he sped away, the cold wind blew, and Elder Han Zhao suddenly realized his back was wet.

After Elder Han Zhao left, the remaining elders exchanged glances. One shrewd elder suggested, “Before Elder Han Zhao returns, why not rest a while in the Recuperation Hall? Let us offer some hospitality.”

“Alright,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“Please!”
