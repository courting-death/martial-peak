## Chapter 471 — I Am Hungry

A thousand miles from War City, on the second floor of a tavern in a stone city, the place was packed with guests, bustling with business. Over a dozen eight-immortal tables were fully occupied by passing martial artists stopping by for food and drink.

At a table by the window, a middle-aged man with a gaunt frame, looking almost like skin stretched over bone, sat with a pale and indifferent expression.

Before him were dozens of wine pots, large and small. Judging by the number alone, no fewer than thirty had been emptied, yet the middle-aged man showed no sign of intoxication—his face remained unflushed, his pulse steady.

His cold and sinister eyes gazed down onto the street below.

Whenever he spotted a martial artist who showed even a hint of prominent strength, his eyes would emit a chilling light, like a ravenous beast that had encountered fresh prey, ready to tear the person limb from limb.

A twitching expression crossed his face, struggling, hesitating, wavering. After a long moment, he finally calmed himself, letting out a resigned sigh, then grabbed another wine pot and drank deeply once more.

“I’m starving,” the middle-aged man murmured softly, his cunning eyes roaming over the guests on the second floor. From his throat emerged strange sounds, heavily suppressed, as if he was fighting hard against the restless urges within. His expression twisted with difficulty.

“The Cangyun Evil Land is better,” he sighed again, “There, I could do whatever I pleased.”

The waiters repeatedly brought out aged fine wines, quickly retreating with trembling hesitation. Whenever they neared this gaunt man—more like a ghostly specter—they could not shake the sensation of hanging by a thread, as if at any moment the man might transform into a malevolent spirit and swallow them whole.

Just as the middle-aged man wore a look of displeasure and frustration, a conversation drifted over from beside him.

It concerned the recent treasure-grabbing battle. The speakers described the scene vividly, as if they had witnessed it themselves.

“Did you all know? The First Young Master of Zhongdu is no longer Liu Qingyao of the Liu Family.”

“Someone defeated Liu Qingyao?” everyone was astonished.

“Not exactly defeated. It was the youngest son of the Yang Family. With his Eighth Stage True Essence Realm strength, he confronted Liu Qingyao head-on for two exchanges without falling behind. But remember, Liu Qingyao is Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm! With such a gap, yet he held his own. Given time… when that young master reaches Liu Qingyao’s level, he will surely surpass him.”

“Is that true?”

“Of course. It’s true—I saw it with my own eyes. That young master is extraordinary. Despite his youth, his cultivation is profound, and he has gathered the support of over a dozen top-tier allies. I think he might be the one to laugh last in the succession war.”

“Impossible, I heard that young master has no connections?”

“Playing the fool to hide the tiger. Let them underestimate him first; then he will strike without warning. Who can resist that?”

“Wasn’t the youngest young master named Yang Kai?”

“Yes, young master Kai…”

Upon hearing those words, the middle-aged man who was guzzling wine suddenly stopped, turned his head to glance in that direction. He clearly took interest.

The conversation was loud enough to carry; everyone on the second floor overheard it. Immediately, some scoffed and retorted, “What do you know? Young Master Liu obviously held back, that’s why Yang Kai could hold out for two exchanges. I saw it myself. You know what Liu said?”

With a chuckle and an air of intrigue, he continued leisurely, “Liu said, ‘Yang Kai, you’re not my opponent. Wait until you grow stronger, then we’ll have a proper battle!’ That’s the demeanor and style befitting Zhongdu’s First Young Master. He was just humoring two exchanges. Do you really think Yang Kai is that impressive?”

The earlier disputant, feeling aggrieved, said, “That was just empty talk from Liu Qingyao. If they had gone to a third exchange, who knows who would win? Yang Kai is the true top in Zhongdu now!”

“Nonsense!”

The dispute quickly spread. At this moment, all martial artists across Greater Han were focused on the succession war. Naturally, everyone had their own opinions about its progress and outcome.

Soon the second floor’s martial artists divided into two camps, shouting and quarrelling incessantly.

Only the middle-aged man by the window remained silent, quietly grinning savagely. Though silent, the dangerous and terrifying gleam emanating from his eyes grew ever more intense.

After much bickering, no conclusion was reached.

The man who had spoken first, flushed and furious, turned to look at the middle-aged man and shouted, “Hey you! Tell us, who really is the top one in Zhongdu now?”

“Want me to say?” The middle-aged man’s expression shifted to surprise and he asked curiously.

“Yes, you! You’re so reserved and taciturn. Clearly you have your thoughts—tell us! Though you call yourself ‘old man’ at your age, ha ha ha!”

Laughter broke out amongst the crowd, suspecting this old man was fond of using his age as a shield.

The tavern grew suddenly silent as all eyes fixed on the middle-aged man, awaiting his verdict.

He nodded lightly, pondered for a moment, then said, “Since you insist... the top person in Zhongdu must be young master Yang Kai. Not only Zhongdu’s best, but in the future—he will be the number one under heaven. Heh heh heh heh!”

The crowd was dumbfounded. Even those supporting Yang Kai thought the middle-aged man had lost his mind.

Calling Yang Kai the current top in Zhongdu was plausible, but claiming he would become the future supreme under heaven was an exaggeration beyond belief.

Martial cultivation is boundless. To this day, even the top experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm dared not claim invincibility in the world.

“That lunatic...” The martial artist backing Liu Qingyao sneered, “What nonsense is that? What kind of trash is Yang Kai, and he’s supposed to become number one under heaven...”

Before he could finish, his words abruptly choked off as an invisible force gripped his throat, stealing his voice.

Everyone turned toward him, their faces darkening with fury.

The martial artist’s face instantly blackened as if poisoned. Blood vessels filled his eyes with red veins, and from his seven orifices, fresh blood poured out.

In the next moment, a visible burst of energy shot from the top of the man’s head, circling in midair before flying straight to the middle-aged man by the window.

The middle-aged man opened his mouth wide and swallowed the energy whole.

Strangely, after absorbing the energy, his gaunt body suddenly swelled slightly. Though still thin, he no longer looked so horrifying.

With a heavy thud, the bloodied martial artist collapsed face-first onto the floor, lifeless.

A chill spread through everyone’s hearts, plunging all the martial artists into icy dread.

No one knew exactly how he died, but after witnessing that scene, everyone understood: this was the work of the terrifying middle-aged man.

A terrifying, cold, sinister, and vicious aura suddenly burst forth, engulfing the entire tavern.

The middle-aged man lowered his head slightly, his throat unleashing a chilling cackle. With his laughter, every martial artist’s vital energy surged, their faces flushing crimson as if their blood had been boiled alive.

“Ha ha ha ha...”

The laughter grew louder and wilder—sinister and eerie beyond measure.

“I’m hungry! You clashed with me, so I won’t hold back. If the young master pursues this later, I’ll have my excuses!” The middle-aged man said, standing still.

Clap, clap, clap…

Blossoms of red light exploded like blooming roses inside the bodies of those martial artists. Their organs spilled out, blood staining the floor. For every life lost, a visible burst of energy flew out from the shredded corpses and was swallowed by the middle-aged man in one gulp.

His emaciated body gradually swelled round and handsome, yet the cold gleam and sinister sharpness in his long, narrow eyes remained unchanged.

In an instant, the second floor turned into an infernal Asura realm. More than twenty martial artists perished violently!

The survivors trembled uncontrollably, lacking even the courage to resist, wearing pitiful looks as they gazed at the middle-aged man, almost in tears.

“Not full yet!” The middle-aged man patted his belly, his expression one of lingering satisfaction. He coldly surveyed the dozen or so survivors, his eyes glinting with restless desire.

At his gaze, all immediately prostrated themselves, kowtowing deeply and begging incessantly for mercy.

After hesitating for a moment, the middle-aged man, for reasons unknown, did not finish them off. Instead, his form flickered and transformed into a wisp of black smoke, vanishing from sight.

After he left, the survivors exchanged glances in astonishment. None understood why this cruel and ruthless man had spared them.

Given his cruel temperament, killing a dozen more would cost him not even a frown, yet he chose not to.

Judging from their looks, they realized these survivors were the same group who had supported Yang Kai earlier, while those who opposed him had all died.

They felt a sense of survival and silently rejoiced.

Looking around at the bloody carnage, everyone’s complexion turned pale, and many vomited up the food they had just eaten.

Even these martial artists, who walked the brink of death daily, had never seen such a horrific scene.

Those who died were reduced to pieces and pulp...

Outside the stone city, a black mist suddenly appeared. The middle-aged man slowly materialized, gazing off toward War City a thousand miles away. A ferocious smile crossed his face as he whispered, “It’s been so long, I wonder how the young master is doing. If I show up looking like this, will he be startled?”
