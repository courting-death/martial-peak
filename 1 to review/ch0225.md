## Chapter 225 â€” The Rising Fury

In just a short span of ten breaths, Yang Kai felt the bottleneck of the Fourth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm shatter. His cultivation soared upward, breaking through to the Fifth Stage with the momentum of a bamboo shoot piercing through the ground, and then continued to ascend, climbing higher and higher...

The sudden breakthrough left Yang Kai somewhat flustered. Although he desired to grow stronger quickly, the frenzied influx of energy had already surpassed the limits he could bear.

His skin and flesh tightened, and without warning, Yang Kai's entire body swelled a size larger. The exposed skin and flesh visibly writhed.

It was as if countless earthworms were wriggling within his body, a sight that was utterly horrifying.

Moments later, his skin split open with numerous cracks, and the muscles within his body burst apart, blood gushing forth, turning him into a bloody and terrifying sight.

Under the immense pressure, the Unyielding Will Proud Bone Golden Body became hungrier than ever, endlessly devouring the refined energy. However, even though Yang Kai's True Yang Technique was operating at its limit, it still could not keep up with the speed of energy influx.

Puff, puff, puff...

Countless muffled sounds erupted from within his body. Accompanying these sounds, bursts of blood mist exploded, and then, countless streaks of crimson light shot out from his body, enveloping a radius of a hundred zhang in this wildly violent energy.

The Earth Demon shouted in terror but received no response from Yang Kai. It was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan, utterly helpless.

Yang Kai suppressed the intense pain coming from all parts of his body, gritting his teeth tightly, his entire body trembling incessantly. At this moment, he couldn't help but feel a sense of defeat and impending collapse. The tremendous pressure from within made him feel as if he were on the verge of toppling over, unable to resist.

As the massive energy continued to pour in, Yang Kai felt his body swell even more.

If this continued, he would inevitably burst from the overwhelming energy.

Moreover, the crisis Yang Kai faced was not solely from the influx of energy; there was also the malevolent aura and killing intent that surged into his mind along with the energy.

This was the aura belonging to two demonic beasts. After their deaths, due to their overwhelming strength, the laws of heaven and earth in this place had condensed their demon cores and flesh essence into blood pearls. Yet, it could not erase their inherent aura.

The threat posed by this killing intent was no less than the impact of the energy.

Yang Kai could only firmly guard his mind, preventing himself from being influenced by the aura of the demonic beasts, while his thoughts raced, contemplating a way to resolve the situation.

In truth, the solution was quite simple. As long as the speed at which his True Yang Primordial Qi refined this energy could keep pace with the influx, he would naturally be able to turn danger into safety.

Although he knew the method, achieving it was exceedingly difficult.

The True Yang Technique had already reached its limit. There was no way to speed it up further.

The remaining solution was to make the True Yang Primordial Qi within him purer and more concentrated!

True Yang Primordial Qi was akin to a flame. The energy surging into his body was like a piece of stubborn iron. The purer and more concentrated the flame, the higher the temperature, and the faster it would melt the stubborn iron.

With no time to ponder deeply, as soon as this thought sprang to mind, Yang Kai gritted his teeth and exploded a drop of Yang Liquid within his Dantian.

A drop of Yang Liquid equated to the totality of the Primordial Qi stored within Yang Kai's meridians!

This explosion made his already full meridians even more congested, and the pain of the meridians swelling and the tearing of flesh made Yang Kai tremble uncontrollably.

Holding his breath and concentrating, he crazily contracted and squeezed his meridians, compressing and purifying the True Yang Primordial Qi within. This was a significant test of willpower, but fortunately, the Unyielding Will played a crucial role at this moment, and the temporarily elevated realm allowed Yang Kai to endure more energy impact.

After enduring for a while, the pressure suddenly lessened somewhat. The True Yang Primordial Qi within his meridians, under Yang Kai's desperate urging, began to burn and fuse with each other. It indeed became purer than before, and the speed of operation increased as well.

With both methods working in tandem, the energy surging into his body could naturally be refined more quickly.

Noticing this, Yang Kai's spirit jolted. He exerted even more effort to compress his meridians and control the fusion of the Primordial Qi.

As time passed, the True Yang Primordial Qi within his body grew increasingly pure, and the efficiency of refining the energy rose higher and higher, with the speed of operation increasing by about half.

From the outside, Yang Kai's swollen body resembled a balloon that had been pricked with a small hole, gradually returning to its original state at an imperceptible speed.

The Earth Demon finally could not help but let out a sigh of relief, hiding within the Soul-Breaking Spike, filled with lingering fears. Yang Kai's life and death were closely tied to him, so how could he not worry?

When the speed of the True Yang Primordial Qi's fusion within his body slowed down, Yang Kai detonated another drop of Yang Liquid, using this life-and-death method to pressurize the fusion of the Primordial Qi.

Half a day later, the True Yang Primordial Qi had reached a certain level of purity. As the True Yang Technique operated, Yang Kai could almost hear the humming sound coming from within his body. This was the melodious tone that would only emerge when the Primordial Qi flowed through the meridians to a certain limit.

At this point, the speed at which the True Yang Primordial Qi refined the energy finally matched the speed at which the two blood pearls were being infused, and his bloated body gradually returned to its normal form.

With his life no longer in danger! Yang Kai couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief, secretly opening his eyes to check, only to find that the two blood pearls in his hand had not changed much, still the same size as when he picked them up.

It seemed he had underestimated the energy within these two blood pearls.

This struggle between life and death led Yang Kai to some insights, not merely a rise in strength.

For a martial artist in the Separation and Union Realm, one of the tasks of cultivation was to prepare for the promotion to the True Essence Realm, making the Primordial Qi within oneself increasingly pure and concentrated. When it reached a certain limit, the Primordial Qi would transform into True Essence, thus smoothly promoting to the True Essence Realm.

Previously, Yang Kai's rise in strength was merely due to an increase in energy within him. However, after experiencing this life-and-death trial, he realized that a breakthrough was not just so monotonous; there were other methods.

One could even say that even if the energy within did not increase, a breakthrough could still be achieved.

When the Primordial Qi reached a certain level of purity, it would signify a breakthrough! With each breakthrough, the Primordial Qi would become increasingly pure, gradually transforming into True Essence.

However, ordinary martial artists did not have the conditions Yang Kai possessed, with such a vast amount of energy stored in their Dantian at all times. Therefore, they could only slowly compress and fuse the Primordial Qi to achieve the effect of purification.

But half a day ago, Yang Kai faced a dire situation, breaking through and standing tall, inadvertently discovering a method suitable for his cultivation. This revelation made him clear about what he should do in the Separation and Union Realm.

The enlightenment and elevation of his mindset made Yang Kai feel light all over, and the sensation of finding a goal was truly wonderful.

The energy within the two blood pearls continued to pour into his body, surging forward like a vast river, becoming his capital for becoming stronger.

The malevolent aura and killing intent emanating from the energy were refined but did not dissipate; instead, they were expelled from the meridians, gathering around Yang Kai's body, impervious to the wind.

Yang Kai naturally noticed this abnormal situation, but he was currently in a critical moment of absorbing energy and had no time to concern himself with it.

Yet, this also indirectly confirmed the formidable nature of those two demonic beasts. Even after countless years of death, even after being refined into blood pearls, their demonic essence still existed.

The absorption of the two blood pearls took Yang Kai a full ten days, consuming more than half of the Yang Liquid in his Dantian before he finally purified them completely.

However, what puzzled the Earth Demon was that despite Yang Kai absorbing such immense energy, he still had not promoted, and his realm remained at the Fifth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm. This discovery left him utterly baffled, unsure of the underlying mystery.

When the two blood pearls finally disappeared, the last trace of killing intent flowed out from Yang Kai's body, gathering at the periphery.

After ten days, the place where Yang Kai sat in meditation had become suffused with killing intent. The killing intent split into two streams, swirling around Yang Kai, incessantly battling each other, reminiscent of the two demonic beasts' confrontation in life.

The area within a hundred zhang was enveloped in a grayish, eerie killing intent. As the last trace of aura gathered, the two streams of killing intent that had been at odds suddenly began to roll and writhe.

In the midst of this rolling, the two streams of killing intent gradually transformed into the shapes of two demonic beasts.

On the left was a creature three zhang tall, entirely snow-white, with fur devoid of any impurities. A king character adorned its forehead, exuding an imposing aura, while two fangs gleamed coldly at the corners of its mouth. Its tail, like a whip, was as strong as steel, whipping the air with a howling wind.

This was undoubtedly a White Tiger!

On the right was an enormous creature, towering at least four to five zhang high, its body reaching into the clouds. It was almost impossible to discern its exact appearance, but from its size, it vaguely resembled an ox, its four legs shaking the ground.

"The Heaven-Shaking White Tiger and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox!" the Earth Demon could not help but exclaim in shock.

As the two beasts took shape, they both roared towards the sky.

The entire valley was instantly filled with a tumultuous atmosphere, and then, they simultaneously transformed into a stream of gray mist, diving into the astonished Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai felt a jolt throughout his body, the killing intent roiling within him, rendering him immobile. What he saw before him was no longer the scenery around him, but rather, in that vast expanse of heaven and earth, the tiger and the ox, two demonic beasts, were fiercely charging and battling, various demonic beast secret techniques flying through the air, causing the world to lose its color and the winds to shift.

This was an unprecedented battle, a manifestation of the resentment between the two demonic beasts in life, now materialized. Even in death, they continued to fight endlessly.

And the battlefield for this struggle was within Yang Kai, who had absorbed their essence.

In life, they had fought evenly, perishing together, and in death, they remained equals, meeting worthy opponents!

Yang Kai did not feel the slightest discomfort. After the initial shock and panic, he calmed down and focused on observing the life-and-death duel of these two demonic beasts.

Such a magnificent battle was not something a martial artist of his level could easily witness. Although it was a fight between demonic beasts, there were still lessons to be learned from it.

Gradually, Yang Kai lost track of time, completely absorbed in the two demonic beasts, intently watching as the sole spectator, his body sitting cross-legged on the ground, the killing intent soaring, visibly apparent, yet it could not affect him in the slightest.
