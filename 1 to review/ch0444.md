## Chapter 444 — Eleven Families

After speaking, he smiled and looked at Luo Xiaoman: “Tell me, why are you so afraid of me? I don’t think I’ve done anything to you, have I?”

Luo Xiaoman blinked her long eyelashes, lowered her head, and whispered, “I don’t know... Anyway, I’m just very afraid of you.”

“How afraid?” Yang Kai took a step forward.

Luo Xiaoman screamed sharply, “Don’t come closer!”

Yang Kai was stunned, quickly stopping in place, afraid that if he took another step, the young lady would faint from fright.

“Forget it, you two chat,” someone said, finding the scene somewhat dull, and strode away.

As expected, the forces from Yingyue Sect had already arrived. Not only that, the sects Chen Xueshu mentioned earlier had also gathered.

They had been on the way, and after receiving Chen Xueshu’s message, they traveled through the night, moving quickly.

At this moment, under Qiu Yimeng’s arrangements, each had found a courtyard to stay in.

After hearing that Yang Kai had emerged from seclusion, they all rushed to the main hall to meet him.

Feng Qianhen from Shui Yue Hall, Zuo Fang from Wen Xin Palace, Han Xiao Qi of Wan Hua Palace, Ye Han, Liu Qingru, Hua Ruoyin, plus Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu—all those encountered during the previous foreign lands excursion—were all present without exception.

After such a long time apart, these leaders from their respective sects had naturally gained opportunities and growth in strength and cultivation. Yet upon realizing Yang Kai’s formidable power, the group all smiled bitterly, lamenting that no matter how hard they strove, they would never catch up to Yang Kai’s pace.

Back in the foreign lands, each of them was at least one realm above Yang Kai, but now Yang Kai had surpassed them all.

Furthermore, Yang Kai’s Eighth Stage True Essence Realm was incomparable to others at the same stage, and over time, this gap would only widen.

Amidst constant greetings, the main hall buzzed with activity.

“It’s a pity Ye Qingsi and Zhou Ba from Shura Sect are overseas. Zi Mo’s Senluo Palace is also abroad, or else everyone would be here now,” Chen Xueshu sighed.

Everyone showed a tinge of nostalgia—back in those foreign lands, everyone had lived and died together, naturally forging a bond.

“Time is long,” Yang Kai chuckled, then suddenly turned to look at Zuo Fang. “How is Li Xinyuan doing now?”

Back then, in the foreign lands, only two from Wen Xin Palace survived—Zuo Fang and Li Xinyuan. Unfortunately, Li Xinyuan was unlucky, having had his dantian broken by the Control Soul Insect used by Tianlang Kingdom’s martial artists, causing his cultivation to be utterly destroyed.

Upon hearing this inquiry, everyone fell silent, their gazes turning concerned.

Zuo Fang’s expression darkened as he bitterly smiled. “Since returning, Senior Brother Li appears optimistic on the surface, but only he knows the bitterness in his heart. My master went to Yao Wang Valley to investigate and found that a pill called Butian Pill can possibly repair damaged dantians. But it requires many rare materials and high-grade craftsmanship. Few can refine it. Master has been gathering the ingredients, but the valley recently faced turmoil and is currently busy, not accepting external cultivation requests for pill-making. We’ll just have to wait longer.”

“Hm, since there is a pill that can repair his dantian, that makes things easier,” Yang Kai nodded. “I’ll help you find someone to refine it.”

“You have connections?” Zuo Fang was overjoyed, but quickly realized this was not the same Yang Kai they met in the foreign lands. This Yang Kai was a legitimate scion of the Yang Family!

“I know a few people; it shouldn’t take long,” Yang Kai smiled faintly, recalling a gentle and serene face.

Qiu Yimeng suddenly chimed in with a smile, “Yang Kai, do you know how much support you have now?”

“Fewer than ten families?” Yang Kai glanced at her.

Qiu Yimeng snorted lightly and listed off, “Qiu Family, Huo Family, Xiang Family, Dong Family, Ziwei Valley, Yingyue Sect, Wen Xin Palace, Fei Yu Pavilion, Wan Hua Palace—nine in total, those you know.”

“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded, even though he had been in seclusion these past days, he was still aware. “What’s wrong?”

“There are more you don’t know about.” Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly.

“Unknown support?” Yang Kai chuckled. “Interesting. Tell me, which ones?”

“Just in time to report to you, the owner, Tianyuan City has also sent supplies and reinforcements.”

“Tianyuan City?” Yang Kai was momentarily stunned.

Qiu Yimeng rolled her eyes silently, “You wouldn’t have extorted them, only to forget, would you?”

“Is this the first-rate force affiliated with Lan River?” Yang Kai recalled: on the return journey to Zhongdu, they were ambushed, not only was the Lü Family implicated, but Tianyuan City was also named by him.

However, he hadn’t intentionally extorted them or sent a message. Now it seemed the management of Tianyuan City was quite clever, sending people and supplies quietly.

“That’s right,” Qiu Yimeng nodded. “I’ve seen those who came; they’re decent, and the leader is the city lord’s son, quite mild-tempered. They’ve been here two days and their subordinates are very obedient. They can be accepted.”

“As long as they aren’t as clueless as Lüsong.” Yang Kai was indifferent. “Decide for yourself. If useful, keep them; if not, send them away.”

Qiu Yimeng’s eyes brightened, inwardly delighted. Looks like Yang Kai was ready to grant her authority and let her show her abilities. She was secretly glad she had temporarily left the Qiu Family to assist him. Otherwise, with Yang Shen alone, she would have been just an ally.

“But since Tianyuan City has come, that’s fine—there’s some reason behind it. But for others we don’t know, no more should be accepted,” Yang Kai reminded once more.

“Understood,” Qiu Yimeng answered happily.

“Besides Tianyuan City, which other unknown supporters are there?” Yang Kai asked again.

Qiu Yimeng’s expression grew serious, and in a low voice said, “Duanmu Family. I wonder if you’ve heard of them.”

“Duanmu Family?” Yang Kai frowned, pondering. “I seem to have heard the name somewhere but can’t recall now. What connection do they have to me that they would come to support me?”

“The Duanmu Family is your third brother Yang Tie’s mother’s natal family! Understand now?” Qiu Yimeng smiled gently.

“My third brother?” Yang Kai was greatly surprised.

“Not many from Duanmu Family came, only five people. But among them is one at Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage, one at Seventh Stage, one at Sixth Stage, and two at Fifth Stage!”

“The five survivors from that night?” Yang Kai was slightly moved. That battle was devastating for the Duanmu Family, which had had thirty or forty people; only five barely survived the massacre. Being able to survive such chaos indicates they were formidable, so their high level was no surprise.

Back then, Yang Kang and Yang Ying led troops chasing after Yang Kai and had no time to deal with those five. By the rules of the succession war, they could have tried to persuade them to join their side.

Yet even if they had, it likely would not have succeeded, given how many from Duanmu Family died.

“That’s right, it’s them,” Qiu Yimeng stared deeply at Yang Kai, her bright red lips shimmering enticingly. “Honestly tell me—when you let your third brother go that night, did you have this plan?”

Glancing at her, Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “You think me too despicable. I let him go simply because I wanted to, without much thought.”

Qiu Yimeng breathed a soft sigh of relief and patted her chest. “Good thing you’re not so scheming; otherwise, I’d really have no hope facing you.”

Hearing the young lady tease him like this, everyone present was moved, as if unable to believe that the current Yang Kai could create such pressure for the famous Qiu Yimeng.

“No matter what, this move was quite exquisite,” Qiu Yimeng smiled coyly. “These five coming to support you must be at Yang Tie’s instruction.”

Yang Kai nodded quietly, never expecting his third brother to reciprocate in this way, and smiled faintly.

“So, that makes eleven families supporting you now!” Qiu Yimeng spoke with growing excitement—few things stirred her like this.

Among these eleven, two are superpowers! Among the other nine, only Yingyue Sect is a second-rate force; the rest are all first-rate!

From a few days ago when no one paid attention and the odds were nine in ten he wouldn’t survive the first night, to now having support from eleven main forces, Yang Kai’s manor has grown and gathered strength astonishingly fast.

With these connections and charisma, he leads among the Yang Family’s legitimate descendants!

Qiu Yimeng seemed to see the dawn of victory shining brightly.

Cooling her expression, the young lady spoke solemnly, “Your current support surpasses any of your brothers. According to my intelligence, only your second brother, Yang Zhao, has twenty helpers, large and small. But many of his helpers are from second or third-rate sects, merely a larger quantity. As for quality, he can’t match you. But in time, your advantage will shrink and might even be surpassed. You must prepare yourself mentally.”

“I know.” Yang Kai grinned confidently. “Not all have arrived yet.”

Qiu Yimeng’s bright eyes glittered. “Someday, you must tell me everything; otherwise, I really won’t know how many helpers you have hidden.”

Seeing Qiu Yimeng soften, the others showed startled expressions, some amused, sensing something extraordinary.

Ye Han from Wan Hua Palace laughed playfully, “Miss Qiu, a woman like you should have no trouble taming a Yang Kai.”

“I’m just not interested,” Qiu Yimeng replied half in jest, secretly gauging Yang Kai’s reaction.

Yang Kai smiled slyly, “Tonight I’ll come to your room, and we’ll have a good talk.”

Qiu Yimeng’s face paled somewhat.

“Still the same lustful heart!” Han Xiao Qi scoffed to the side. Back in the foreign lands, Yang Kai had taken liberties with every woman except Shu Xiaoyu. The memories were vivid, and Han Xiao Qi wasn’t about to forget.
