## Chapter 454 — Extremely Strange

The lively noise within the Hall suddenly fell silent. Smiles still lingered on the faces of those present, but each one stared at Qiu Yimeng and Yang Kai in disbelief, suspicion clouding their features as if questioning whether they had heard wrong, or perhaps Qiu Yimeng had misspoken.

"Young Lady Qiu actually has a sense of humor," Huo Xingchen suddenly laughed heartily.

Those in the Hall were momentarily stunned, then they too couldn't help but smile. No one had expected Qiu Yimeng to reveal such a side of herself.

However, the joke was poor indeed, lacking any genuine humor. The audience only feigned amusement out of politeness, wary of embarrassing Qiu Yimeng.

Qiu Yimeng remained composed, her beautiful eyes scanning the crowd without retaliation or withdrawing. After a long pause, she asked calmly, "Is it funny?"

A light cough sounded, and all present composed themselves and sat upright.

"Perhaps you think I'm joking, but I speak the truth. What was distributed to you were lower-level Mystery-Grade Hunyuan Pills. The pills are in your hands; open them and see for yourselves," she said plainly and directly, without the slightest hint of jest.

"Impossible," Huo Xingchen replied incredulously, shaking his head. "I've taken the Hunyuan Pill before; it is supposed to be a Heaven-Grade upper-level pill. How could it suddenly become Mystery-Grade?"

Though only one level apart, the difference between Mystery-Grade and Heaven-Grade was immense. Pills below Mystery-Grade were just ordinary pills, but a Mystery-Grade pill was already considered an extraordinary pill.

Each Mystery-Grade pill was difficult to refine, requiring rare ingredients and the alchemist’s tremendous effort and time.

Since the arrival of the Yao Wang Valley’s group only half a month ago, everyone knew well the caliber of the alchemists present.

For them to have refined so many Heaven-Grade upper-level pills in such a short time was already commendable.

Yet Qiu Yimeng claimed these were Mystery-Grade Hunyuan Pills. Naturally, no one believed it. Setting aside the impossibility of producing enough Mystery-Grade pills for everyone so hastily, it was unheard of for Hunyuan Pills to even exist at the Mystery-Grade level.

As Huo Xingchen spoke, he opened a pill bottle and casually poured out a pill. His once unbothered expression suddenly changed to one of shock as he stared at the pill in his hand.

Others followed suit. When the pills were exposed, an eruption of exclamations and confusion rose.

“You all hold high positions in your sects and must have taken Hunyuan Pills before, skilled enough to recognize their quality. See for yourselves,” Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly, saying no more.

Indeed, when she first saw this batch that morning, she had thought Yang Kai was joking. But after confirming with her own eyes, she reluctantly admitted that these were indeed lower-level Mystery-Grade Hunyuan Pills!

“How is this possible?” Huo Xingchen was stunned. A Mystery-Grade Hunyuan Pill broke all conventions.

In alarm, Young Master Huo quickly emptied all the pill bottles, inspecting each one, and found to his astonishment that they truly were Mystery-Grade pills.

“This cannot be,” Huo Xingchen muttered, his mind swirling with disbelief.

“Look, these Mystery Pills actually bear vein-like patterns resembling human meridians!” someone exclaimed, as if discovering a new world.

“Pill Patterns!”

“My heavens, I have some Mystery Pills with Pill Patterns here too!”

“I have four of them! Haha... I only heard rumors about pills with Pill Patterns, never imagined I’d witness them firsthand.”

Moreover, these weren’t just one or two; nearly 20 to 30 percent of the pills bore these Pill Patterns.

Everyone was shaken, their expressions alternating between surprise and excitement.

Pill Patterns were marks left when a top-tier alchemist reached a sufficiently high level during refinement. Such patterns resembled human meridians and appeared on the pill’s surface.

A pill with Pill Patterns instantly doubled in value! With them, its effects were greatly amplified. Moreover, such pills didn’t lose potency over time. On the contrary, Pill Patterns could absorb the ambient Primordial Qi, nourishing the pill’s Divine Pill essence, making the effects even stronger.

Beyond Pill Patterns, there was the legendary Pill Cloud — a dreamlike coating spreading over a pill, offering power exceeding even that of Pill Patterns.

These were only tales. Though the attendants were high-ranking, few had ever seen pills with Pill Patterns. Not because their sects lacked funds, but because ordinary alchemists simply could not craft such pills.

Many devoted alchemists could only refine a pill with Pill Patterns by chance or incredible fortune.

The higher the grade of the pill, the slimmer the chance of Pill Patterns appearing!

Pill Patterns were the mark of an elite alchemist’s work and signaled a supreme pill!

And now, of all the Mystery Pills in hand, at least two-tenths bore Pill Patterns! This ratio was frightening.

Pills with Pill Patterns were more exciting than any treasure.

Streams of excited whispers filled the Hall.

Liu Feisheng, the Young Lord of Tianyuan City, was especially moved, clutching two bottles of Mystery Pills in flushed hands, breathing heatedly.

He thought silently: Joining this Young Master was indeed the right choice. Before any battle had erupted, each house had already received two bottles of Mystery Pills. With so many good things ahead, why worry?

Even the four young girls of Wan Hua Palace were in near-euphoria. Of them, Han Xiao Qi, composed and aloof, managed to maintain her Senior Sister dignity despite her excitement, her eyes shining as she kept looking at Yang Kai in gratitude.

Ye Han, livelier by nature, was eagerly inspecting each pill. Every time she discovered a Mystery Pill with Pill Patterns, she shouted excitedly, drawing reproachful looks from the other Senior Sisters, who reminded her to keep her manners.

“Senior Qin is truly formidable; Yao Wang Valley is indeed remarkable!” After some time, Chu Jingshan of Fei Yu Pavilion praised.

“Yes, Senior Qin’s capability now rivals that of Master Xiao,” Feng Qianhen from Shui Yue Hall said with a bright smile.

Huo Xingchen frowned, holding a Mystery Pill tightly, and stared straight at Yang Kai.

Unlike those from first-rate sects, though Huo Xingchen was a playboy, his exposure to things was distinctly higher. His Huo Family had Mystery-Grade alchemists, more than one, but even they could not, in such a short time, produce so many Mystery Pills. Given ten more years, they still wouldn’t manage this many with Pill Patterns!

Qin Ze might be the young master of Yao Wang Valley, but he was only a lower-level Mystery-Grade alchemist. Surely not that capable.

Qiu Yimeng’s gaze swept over. The two young men from prestigious families exchanged looks of doubt.

This matter was strangely perplexing.

Having received Mystery Pills, everyone was eager to cultivate. With such pills aiding them, raising their strength was only a matter of time.

One by one, they departed, returning to their quarters for secluded cultivation. Even Huo Xingchen could not wait to test the Mystery Pills’ effects.

After all had left, Qiu Yimeng smiled at Yang Kai and said, “Shouldn’t you tell me who refined this batch of pills?”

“Don’t ask. If I need to tell you, I will,” Yang Kai said faintly, shaking his head. This concerned his little Senior Sister; under no circumstances would he reveal it.

Besides members of Yao Wang Valley and Yang Kai himself, no one was permitted into the alchemy room, not even Qiu Yimeng dared interfere. Hence, she truly did not know the pills’ origin.

Thinking quickly, Qiu Yimeng hummed, “I figured so. It must be because of your little Senior Sister that this batch exists.”

Astute as ever, Young Lady Qiu deduced that Qin Ze probably lacked such capability, and since only Yang Kai and Yao Wang Valley disciples entered the alchemy room, the trace naturally pointed to Xia Ningshang.

“Don’t speak nonsense. I might kill you to keep it secret,” Yang Kai shot her a warning glance.

Qiu Yimeng's face paled slightly, surprised. What she'd said was offhand, but Yang Kai’s reaction confirmed the pills were indeed connected to that little Senior Sister.

Without pressing further against Yang Kai, Qiu Yimeng’s expression turned serious. She realized Xia Ningshang was far more than merely the woman Yang Kai favored.

But aside from the veil shrouding her face, she seemed unremarkable. Her strength, though, was formidable: a first stage Divine Roaming Realm expert. Could it be she refined these pills?

She shook her head wryly, dismissing the outrageous notion.

Regaining composure, she found Yang Kai had disappeared without a trace.

“One day, I will uncover all your secrets!” she promised with a light snort.

Yang Kai’s mysteries intrigued her deeply, especially now that even the woman by his side grew enigmatic.

Yang Kai casually approached his little Senior Sister’s room. Xia Ningshang had been busy refining pills lately and only now had a moment to rest. They hadn’t talked properly for some time.

The door was open. Peering inside, Yang Kai’s face grew strange.

Not only was Xia Ningshang there, but Lan Chudie was also present. Both women appeared to be chatting happily, grinning.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, their gazes turned his way.

“The two Senior Sisters look pleased. What are you discussing?” Yang Kai asked casually as he entered.

Xia Ningshang and Lan Chudie exchanged smiles.

“Women’s matters. Not for your ears,” Lan Chudie chided with a playful scowl.

“We’re hardly outsiders. Do tell," Yang Kai chuckled.

Hearing this, Lan Chudie’s eyes brightened, her heart secretly delighted.
