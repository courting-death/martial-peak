## Chapter 246 — Entering the Trap (Part Two)

Hearing this, Yang Kai expressed some concern, “Is your Senior Brother Chi Xue nearby? If Chi Xue is also here, then we’re in big trouble.”

Chi Xue is a master at the True Essence Realm Seventh Stage, and he even has a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast under his control, making him quite formidable.

Zi Mo sighed, “Let’s hope he isn’t.”

An hour later, the three finally arrived at their destination. Zi Mo slid down from Yang Kai’s back, casting him a grateful glance as she adjusted her clothes and tidied her messy hair. Then, her pretty face turned cold as she strode ahead.

From a distance, Yang Kai spotted many Demonic Beasts and a dozen figures gathered together.

As Zi Mo approached, two individuals stood up—Yao He and Yao Xi from Senluo Palace. The man and woman were smiling as they looked over, showing no signs of guilt. With a command, hundreds of Demonic Beasts scattered, surrounding Zi Mo’s army of Demonic Beasts.

“Senior Sister has finally arrived,” Yao He said with a frivolous expression, clearly looking down on Zi Mo. He greeted her with a light laugh, while Yao Xi giggled, disdainfully eyeing Zi Mo.

“Didn’t you ask me to come?” Zi Mo shot them a cold look, stopping about ten zhang away.

The three disciples of Senluo Palace faced off against each other, the air thick with tension.

Yang Kai stood behind Zi Mo, scanning the area and spotting many familiar faces.

Ten zhang away, four young women from Wan Hua Palace sat cross-legged on the ground, their expressions despondent. Ye Qingsi and Zhou Ba from Shura Sect, along with Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu from Yingyue Sect, were huddled together. In addition, disciples from Twin Islands, Shui Yue Hall, Wen Xin Palace, Fei Yu Pavilion, and many other sects were still alive.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu exchanged bitter smiles with him, sharing a sense of camaraderie in their shared misfortune.

Yang Kai nodded slightly in acknowledgment. There were still about sixteen or seventeen of them left, but their original numbers should have been much higher. Many must have perished during this time.

“You two, get to the side!” Yao He glanced at Yang Kai and Leng Shan, issuing his command arrogantly.

Zi Mo nodded slightly.

Only then did Yang Kai and Leng Shan walk toward Chen Xueshu and the others.

As both sides gathered, one of the girls from Wan Hua Palace looked at Yang Kai and sighed, “You didn’t escape your misfortune either.”

Yang Kai smiled, “Indeed. May I ask for your name, miss?”

The last time they met, when Wu Chengyi had made things difficult for him, this girl had spoken up for him, so Yang Kai had some fondness for her. The four sisters, Chunlan and Qiuhua, were all striking in their own right, and sitting together, they formed a beautiful sight.

The girl forced a smile, “Han Xiao Qi!”

Another girl, who seemed a bit more playful, pouted, “You’re in such a dire situation, yet you still have the mood to inquire about a girl’s name? You don’t seem like a good person.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow at her, “Haven’t you heard the saying that a man should remain true to his nature? I haven’t asked for your name yet…”

The girl pouted, “Ye Han!”

Over there, Ye Qingsi chuckled, “We share the same surname. If we survive and return, I must become sworn sisters with you, Han.”

Han Xiao Qi smiled as she introduced her other two junior sisters, one named Hua Ruoyin, who was more serene, and the other, Liu Qingru, who was more charming.

As fellow wanderers in misfortune, with Yang Kai as a new face, everyone began to introduce themselves.

Feng Qianhen from Shui Yue Hall, Zuo Fang and Li Xinyuan from Wen Xin Palace, and Chu Jingshan from Fei Yu Pavilion…

The elite disciples from various sects gathered together, and the atmosphere became much more cheerful, alleviating some of the worries and fears that had accumulated over the days.

“Hmph, facing death, you still have the mood to chat. It’s too late to say these things after surviving,” a discordant voice interrupted the laughter, sounding extremely out of place.

Yang Kai turned to look, spotting a man sneering at him.

With a flicker of his gaze, Yang Kai remained unfazed.

Ye Qingsi coldly laughed, “Bi Xiuming. Ever since you were captured, you’ve been pouring cold water on us every few days. What’s your point?”

Bi Xiuming sneered, “No point. Just a useless person has arrived. Is he worth your excitement? Are you really hoping he can save us?”

Chen Xueshu frowned, “If you believe you have no hope of survival, then just end it yourself. Why ruin others’ spirits? And don’t slander Brother Yang; he’s merely at a lower Realm.”

Bi Xiuming remained silent. However, another person beside him chuckled, “Being at a lower Realm means he’s useless! I really don’t understand how a waste like him has survived until now; he should have died long ago instead of dragging on.”

This person was likely from the same sect as Bi Xiuming, being a senior brother, naturally standing on the same side.

Han Xiao Qi coldly said, “You’re talking too much.”

Ye Han, Hua Ruoyin, and Liu Qingru glared at him in indignation.

Although Bi Xiuming and his companion looked down on Yang Kai, they didn’t want to provoke the crowd’s anger and merely snorted, falling silent.

With their disturbance, the previously cheerful atmosphere was instantly shattered, leaving everyone feeling heavy-hearted.

Ye Han puffed her cheeks to comfort Yang Kai, “Yang Kai, right? Don’t mind them. These two are always pessimistic and can’t stand others being in a good mood.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I’m not bothered. Just barking dogs.”

Han Xiao Qi was taken aback, then broke into a smile.

“What did you say?” Bi Xiuming and his companion opened their eyes wide, glaring at Yang Kai with murderous intent.

“If your ears aren’t deaf, you should have heard clearly,” Yang Kai said, maintaining a calm expression.

“You’re courting death!” Bi Xiuming shouted angrily, standing up abruptly.

“Do you all want to die?” Yao He shouted angrily from the side, “If you want to die, I can fulfill that wish right now!”

Bi Xiuming glanced at Yao He with trepidation, then reluctantly sat back down, glaring at Yang Kai with rage, “You wait, I’ll make you pay for this!”

“Sure, I’ll wait!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

The atmosphere among the Great Han martial artists was explosive, while the atmosphere among the Tianlang trio was equally delicate.

Since Zi Mo returned, Yao He and Yao Xi merely smiled at her, remaining silent.

After a long while, Zi Mo finally exhaled softly and coldly asked, “Why are you doing this?”

Yao He chuckled lightly, “Why? Senior Sister Zi, can’t you figure it out?”

“Is it just because the Master favored me a bit more in the sect?” Zi Mo sneered.

Yao He and Yao Xi’s expressions slightly changed, their faces turning cold.

Zi Mo continued, “You entered the sect before me, yet your strength hasn’t grown as quickly as mine, leaving you unwilling and resentful. Is this your justification and excuse for calling me Senior Sister?”

“Do you really think you’re exceptionally gifted?” Yao Xi scoffed, “If it weren’t for the Master giving you more resources, how could you have surpassed us? Based solely on individual talent, we’re no worse than you!”

“You’ve never been better than me!” Zi Mo refused to back down, countering sharply.

A hint of disdain appeared on Yao He’s face, “Oh really? Then may I ask, Senior Sister, did you ever foresee this situation?”

“I truly didn’t expect you to be so vicious and dare to lay hands on me!” Zi Mo’s face was filled with hatred.

Yao He sneered, “Forget it, I won’t say much more. After all, you are Senior Sister! We called you here not for any other reason, but because we can’t leave this damned place for the time being, and there are no enemies here. So we thought, Senior Sister, you wouldn’t need those Demonic Beasts anymore, right?”

Zi Mo’s pretty face turned icy, “You want my Demonic Beasts?”

“Exactly!” Yao He nodded, “Xiao Xi and I are just a step away from breaking through. We’re a bit reluctant to kill our own Demonic Beasts, so we can only hope Senior Sister can contribute a bit.”

Zi Mo felt heartbroken, “Is this the reason you would even destroy a thread of my soul?”

Yao Xi giggled, “Who made you hide away? If you hadn’t hidden, we wouldn’t have done this. Now that we’re stuck here with little fun, we originally wanted to have a hunting contest with your Demonic Beasts, but things didn’t go as planned, and you forced our hand.”

“Fine!” Zi Mo’s expression turned pained, a hint of determination in her eyes, “If you want my Demonic Beasts, you can have them all!”

Yao He laughed heartily, “I knew Senior Sister would be easy to talk to. Please give the order to have them not resist; otherwise, if it comes to blows, it might not end well!”

Zi Mo closed her eyes, her chest rising and falling.

Although she had already retrieved the thread of soul from the Control Soul Insects taken by the two since arriving here, and no longer needed to worry about Yao He and Yao Xi destroying her thread of soul, they still held overwhelming advantages. Not to mention the numerous Demonic Beasts they controlled, even the dozen or so Great Han martial artists under control were a formidable fighting force.

If a real fight broke out, Zi Mo had no chance of winning. Even breaking out would be difficult, so despite her unwillingness, she could only temporarily compromise.

Fixating on Zi Mo’s towering peaks, a hidden lustful glint flashed in Yao He’s eyes as he unconsciously licked his lips.

“Alright!” Zi Mo opened her eyes and said expressionlessly.

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged glances, silently issuing commands.

In an instant, the cries of countless Demonic Beasts echoed, blood splattering everywhere as one after another, the unresisting Demonic Beasts were brought down, their necks bitten through by their own kind, dying on the spot.

The group of Great Han martial artists looked horrified, their hearts racing.

In just a few breaths, thirty or forty Demonic Beasts had been killed.

“Hahaha!” Yao He laughed loudly.

With thirty or forty blood beads, one of them could break through to the True Essence Realm Fifth Stage.

As for the rest, once they extracted the secrets of the Great Han martial artists, they could slaughter them all. At that time, it would be another substantial gain of blood beads.

What excited Yao He even more were the several beauties among the Great Han, each stunning and alluring. For days, he had been trying to get close to them, but Yao Xi had been keeping a close watch, never leaving his side, leaving him with no opportunity.

Although they were cousins, their relationship was far from simple…

He needed to think of a way to distract his cousin, then he could indulge himself. Yao He glanced at Han Xiao Qi and the others, unable to suppress his swallowing.

Yes, let her use these dozens of blood beads first; it would take her some time to refine and absorb them to break through to the True Essence Realm Fifth Stage. That time would be enough for him to have his fun.

The more Yao He thought about it, the more excited he became, wishing he could immediately embrace the beauties of the Great Han, indulging in their charms and savoring that **-eroding pleasure.
