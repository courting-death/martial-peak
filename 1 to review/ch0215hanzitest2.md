## Chapter 215 — Cooperation (Part Two)

"Now you should understand why I said that killing there requires no reason or excuse, right? The blood beads obtained after killing are the best excuse and reason! There, a life is merely a stepping stone to becoming stronger, especially since you are only at the third level of the **Separation and Union Realm**, making you an easier target," **Ling Taixu** said in a deep voice.

杨开 showed a look of astonishment, but more than that, he was filled with excitement and surprise.

**Ling Taixu** saw through 杨开’s expression and could not help but sigh inwardly, thinking that this kid truly intended to prove his martial path through killing.

If it were another **Separation and Union Realm** third-level martial artist hearing such things, they would likely be terrified and avoid it. Yet, 杨开 appeared eager, wishing he could immediately rush to that place and immerse himself in endless slaughter.

There, one need not worry about harming innocents. Even if 杨开 did not take the initiative to kill, there would still be people coming to kill him. Moreover, there were many evil martial artists there, all of whom deserved to die.

Along the way, **Ling Taixu** shared much information about that place. After all, he had trained there many years ago and had firsthand experience, which was invaluable.

杨开 listened earnestly, not daring to miss a single detail.

According to **Ling Taixu**, that place was located in **Ghostly Underworld Mountain** but did not truly belong to it. It was a peculiar **space**, and the entrance was in a lake within Ghostly Underworld Mountain.

No one knew what kind of unique energy and heavenly rules existed inside, but as long as living beings died there, their energy and flesh essence would condense into blood beads, including those of humans and demon beasts! These blood beads could be consumed by oneself or brought out for others to use, and they were quite valuable. Moreover, the stronger the person or demon beast that died, the higher the value of the blood bead, and the greater the enhancement it could provide.

Additionally, in that place, all offensive and defensive secret treasures would have no effect, likely sealed by some invisible energy. Upon hearing this, 杨开’s heart sank.

With his current strength at only the third level of **Separation and Union Realm**, who knew how many **True Essence Realm** experts would flock there? If he encountered these experts without the assistance of the **Shura Sword** or 千蕊**Blood Sea Begonia**, he would surely be at a disadvantage, and it was highly likely he would be killed.

However, thinking that others were in the same predicament, 杨开 felt somewhat balanced.

That strange place opened once every ten years, and 杨开 was fortunate this time, as he had just returned to **Lingxiao Pavilion** in time. If he had returned a few months later, he would have certainly missed it.

Finally, **Ling Taixu** solemnly handed 杨开 a small cloth bag.

This bag was only about the size of a palm. It was engraved with many intricate patterns, made of strange materials, and looked very exquisite.

"What is this?" 杨开 asked in confusion.

"I call it the **the Spatial Pouch**. Don’t be fooled by its small size; it can hold a substantial amount of items," **Ling Taixu** replied.

杨开 was once again moved. He looked at **Ling Taixu** in surprise, not expecting that even such a legendary treasure, specifically used for storing items, would be possessed by him.

"These are all left behind by our ancestor. There is probably only one of its kind in the entire **Great Han**, and even your 八大家 do not have one," **Ling Taixu** said lightly.

Oh, wait, **Meng Wuya** might have one too, but that old fellow hoards all treasures and gives them to no one but his disciples, truly stingy.

"I’ve prepared some **Dan Pill** for you inside. Use them sparingly," **Ling Taixu** reminded.

"Thank you,师公! When I return, I will return this bag to you," 杨开 said, solemnly tucking the small bag into his bosom.

This thing was indeed a supreme treasure, a secret treasure capable of storing items. People only heard rumors of such things appearing in the past, but no one had ever seen one.

However, 杨开 had a wordless black book made from **Soul-Calming Stone** within him, which could also be used to refine treasures for storing items, and its grade was certainly much higher than that of the **the Spatial Pouch**.

But now, 杨开 sat atop a mountain of treasures yet did not know how to utilize them, which was truly tragic.

After flying forward for about a day, a deep and eerie mountain range, exuding a strange aura, appeared before **Ling Taixu** and 杨开.

**Ghostly Underworld Mountain**! The only forbidden place in **Great Han**! A desolate and ancient aura rushed toward them, as if this forbidden land were a giant dragon that had been lying here since ancient times, sending chills down one’s spine.

As they approached the mountain, before they could enter, two teams suddenly charged out from either side.

On the left, there were six people. 杨开 focused his gaze and saw that they were all women. Leading them were an old woman and a beautiful matron, with the remaining four appearing to be young girls.

The four young girls wore small bells on their wrists and ankles, and as they ran, the crisp and pleasant jingling echoed like a mountain stream, refreshing to the ears.

Moreover, this group of women were all exceptionally beautiful. The beautiful matron was graceful and noble, her figure voluptuous and full. Her long black hair was styled into a bun at the back of her head, revealing her fair and slender neck, exuding a mature and alluring beauty. Especially her pair of eyes, which sparkled like autumn waves, captivating and enchanting, as if they could speak, making the sky bluer and the flowers more fragrant.

The four young girls were even more charming, at the age of budding beauty, gracefully approaching with their delicate arms partially exposed. Each had skin as white as snow, surpassing frost, and their small, exquisite feet outlined a unique beauty. With their varying charms—some shy, some stunning, some as cold as ice, and others as passionate as fire—they huddled together, enough to drive any man mad. Although the girls’ charm was not as mature and enticing as that of the beautiful matron, they possessed a youthful and captivating allure.

As for the old woman, though she appeared very aged, one could still faintly see that she must have been exceptionally beautiful in her youth, but the relentless passage of time had left many indelible marks on her face.

This group stopped about thirty zhang in front of 杨开 and **Ling Taixu**, and the old woman glanced at the two with a faint expression, letting out a soft snort.

Those who came to **Ghostly Underworld Mountain** at this time clearly shared the same purpose.

The entrance to that peculiar space was limited, making them competitors.

**Ling Taixu** smiled slightly at the old woman and whispered to 杨开, "They are from the first-rate sect **Wan Hua Palace**. Young people are often impulsive, so be careful not to fall for these little girls’ tricks, or else you might end up with nothing but bones."

杨开’s eyes sparkled as he scrutinized the four young girls. Upon hearing **Ling Taixu**’s words, he immediately straightened his expression, saying, "师公, rest assured, I will be careful."

A moment later, those on the right also arrived. Looking over, he saw that the leader was an old man who appeared to be of similar age to **Ling Taixu**. Behind him were three young people, both male and female, all of whom were quite formidable, though regardless of gender, they all exuded a somewhat sinister aura.

The two young men were even bolder than 杨开, their eyes almost glued to the female disciples of **Wan Hua Palace**, causing the young girls beside them to feel quite displeased, unable to suppress a snort.

"These are people from **Ghost King Valley**," **Ling Taixu**’s expression darkened. "You’re in trouble."

"Why?" 杨开 asked, puzzled.

"Because I had a few encounters with that old man back in the day. This is an evil sect, so you must be careful of their skills," **Ling Taixu** replied.

杨开 focused his gaze and indeed saw that the hands of the three people opposite were somewhat strange, lacking the usual blood color, appearing instead pale and eerie, resembling ghostly claws.

Suddenly, the old man opposite let out a cold laugh, "**Ling Taixu**! You’re still alive!"

**Ling Taixu** snorted lightly, "**Gui Li**, you’re not dead either!"

"Good, good, good." **Gui Li** grinned savagely, "I was worried you’d die and I wouldn’t find anyone to take revenge on. I didn’t expect to run into you here today. Truly a blessing from the heavens."

"What? Is fifty years of humiliation not enough for you? Today you want to seek death?" **Ling Taixu** sneered, showing no fear.

**Gui Li**’s expression twisted, "Old grievances, what’s the point of bringing them up? Fifty years ago, I lost to you, but that doesn’t mean I will lose again fifty years later!"

"Want to give it a try?" **Ling Taixu** smiled proudly.

**Gui Li**’s eyes were as eerie as ghostly fire, staring at **Ling Taixu** with a hint of dread.

The two faced off, and the three disciples of **Ghost King Valley** behind **Gui Li** glared at 杨开.

杨开 grinned at them, his expression unchanged.

"Bang!" A sound echoed as the old woman from **Wan Hua Palace** struck her dragon-headed cane against the ground.

"If the two of you do not wish to fight, why don’t we discuss teaming up to enter **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**?" The old woman looked at **Ling Taixu** and **Gui Li** calmly.

Though **Ling Taixu** and **Gui Li** had grievances, they truly did not want to fight right now, as they were all here to train. If they missed the timing, it could ruin everything. The old woman was perceptive and saw that both needed a way out, which is why she spoke up.

**Gui Li** chuckled, "I’ll give Palace Master Yan some face and not hold this against you today. Once this matter is settled, **Ling Taixu**, we will definitely have a battle!"

"Anytime!" 

**Gui Li**’s gaze was cold as he scrutinized 杨开, showing no intention of hiding his thoughts. He turned to his three disciples and said, "Remember this kid’s appearance, and kill him once we’re inside!"

"Understood!" The three replied coldly.

杨开’s expression turned cold as he secretly memorized the appearances of these three.

With the old woman from **Wan Hua Palace** mediating, **Ling Taixu** and **Gui Li** temporarily set aside their grievances. The three of them briefly discussed, with the old woman leading the way, the four young girls following closely behind, **Gui Li** in the center coordinating with his three disciples, while 杨开 and **Ling Taixu** brought up the rear.

As for the beautiful matron, she was also positioned centrally, just on the left and right of **Gui Li**.

With these four **Divine Roaming Realm** experts guarding them, the younger generation of disciples could be said to be extremely safe, provided that **Ling Taixu** and **Gui Li** did not play any tricks on each other.

Naturally, **Ling Taixu** would not act so maliciously, but it was hard to say the same for **Gui Li**. It was precisely because of this concern that the old woman had let **Ling Taixu** take the rear, to prevent **Gui Li** from launching a sneak attack.

Fortunately, **Gui Li** was also a sensible man. As they proceeded, he did not make any moves, honestly maintaining his position.

**Ghostly Underworld Mountain**, notorious for its dangers, saw the group enter cautiously, holding their breath and keeping silent, for even at the periphery, they might encounter powerful demon beasts of the fifth or sixth rank.

The women from **Wan Hua Palace** seemed to have used some method, as the bells on their wrists and ankles made no sound at all, allowing the group to move silently.
