## Chapter 247 — Exposing My Shame, Exposing My Shame (Third Watch)

Yao He turned to Yao Xi and said, “Yao Xi, you go first with the Blood Bead.”

Yao Xi’s face flushed with emotion and tenderness. She gave a slight nod, then tilted her delicate face toward the Great Han martial artists and issued an order with a wave of her finger. “Collect the Blood Beads for me!”

Seventeen or eighteen people exchanged glances, but no one was willing to move.

They had endured countless humiliations under Yao He and Yao Xi in recent days. They longed to grind those two siblings to dust, so why would they now do their bidding?

Yet if they stalled on this order, they would risk incurring even more torture and disaster.

One of Wan Hua Palace’s disciples, Ye Han, stood up in a huff, her little tiger fangs gleaming, and ground her teeth as she spat, “I’ll go.”

Yang Kai rolled his eyes, reached out, and tugged at her arm. “Let me do it. You rest.”

Bi Xiuming, who had been sitting in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes at their words. He chuckled and jeered, “What? You’ve just been subdued and already want to prove your loyalty? You even fight for this kind of task?”

Yang Kai smiled and rose to his feet. “Under this roof, one must bow one’s head.”

Bi Xiuming and his junior brother sneered with contempt, their expressions mocking, which caused many to frown.

They set out to the spot where the Demonic Beasts lay slain and gathered more than thirty Blood Beads, then strode back to the three standing before Senluo Palace.

Yao Xi regarded Yang Kai with cool caution.

After all, he was brought here by Zi Mo, and Yao Xi could not lower her guard.

“Throw the Blood Beads over here!” Yao Xi ordered coldly when Yang Kai came within about three zhang. She would not let him draw any closer.

Yang Kai nodded, exerted a subtle strength, and one by one flung the thirty-plus Blood Beads across to Yao Xi, who caught every single one without missing.

Zi Mo watched impassively. Once Yao Xi had collected all the Blood Beads, she spoke. “Now have you gotten what you desired? If there is nothing else, I shall be on my way.”

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged a glance and both smiled lightly. “Senior Sister, where do you intend to go?”

Zi Mo’s face darkened. She said in a low, stern voice, “Where I go is none of your concern!”

Yao Xi laughed melodiously. “Senior Sister, your temper is as fiery as ever. We only worry for your safety. In this strange land fraught with peril, without a Demonic Beast to guard you, if you venture out and meet with misfortune, how will we answer to our master?”

Zi Mo stared at them in disbelief. “You even wish to control me?”

Yao He replied, “How could you say that, Senior Sister? We are family and should look after one another.”

Yao Xi nodded. “Yes, for your safety, Senior Sister, Junior Sister advises you to stay.”

A cold smile curled on Zi Mo’s lips, but her face was filled with grief. On the way here, Yang Kai had already warned her that Yao He and Yao Xi might go so far as to finish the matter once and for all. If they dared to touch her Demonic Beast, they would dare to harm her personally. Yang Kai’s predictions had proven uncannily accurate.

In a place like this, if they killed Zi Mo after disposing of her Demonic Beast, they would leave no evidence, and those Great Han martial artists would all be silenced. Yao He and Yao Xi would have no reason to fear.

Zi Mo fell silent, her eyes growing ice-cold.

Yao Xi suddenly frowned and turned to Yang Kai, sharply scolding, “What are you standing there for? Hurry back!”

She then sneered at Zi Mo. “Senior Sister, is this how you instruct your subordinates? Where is your courtesy?”

Zi Mo said nothing, but Yang Kai gave an awkward smile and clasped his hands toward her in salute. His eyes flashed with resentment as he spoke, “Ladies, could you remove that insect from my body? I wish to desert the dark path and pledge my loyalty to you.”

At these words, Zi Mo whirled on Yang Kai with bared teeth. “What did you just call me?”

“You,” Yang Kai said, as if emboldened. “What’s wrong?”

He straightened his back, ready for confrontation.

Zi Mo laughed spitefully. “You dare call me that? Have you forgotten who is in charge?”

This was the same tongue-lashing Yang Kai had given her before, now returned in full.

“The lesson wasn’t enough!” Zi Mo’s killing intent flared, and Yang Kai writhed on the ground in agony, clutching his belly and rolling about. He cried out to Yao He and Yao Xi, “Help! I truly wish to serve you in life and death!”

This commotion naturally caught the attention of the Great Han martial artists.

Those who had some affection for Yang Kai winced at his shameless words. Han Xiao Qi of Wan Hua Palace frowned, clearly appalled by his lack of backbone.

Bi Xiuming and his junior brother burst into loud laughter. “What did he say? That he pledges loyalty to them? Hahaha… I knew he seized that task to prove loyalty. No wonder he’s so fawning!”

They spat contemptuously on the ground.

Utter shame. Abject shame! Though the Great Han martial artists were also controlled, none had begged so lowly as Yang Kai.

Yang Kai continued his lamentations, seemingly oblivious to his disgrace. “Help me! For my loyalty, spare my life!”

Yao He and Yao Xi watched this drama with delight.

Zi Mo was their target, and Yang Kai was brought here by her. Yet now, the betrayer was among their own fold, a splendid turn of events.

Not for Yang Kai’s sake, but to humble Zi Mo, Yao He and Yao Xi could no longer stand by. The spineless martial artist would soon lose all dignity.

“Senior Sister, please stop,” Yao Xi said with a triumphant smile, holding back laughter.

Zi Mo looked up, her eyes cold. “What, you chide me for disciplining my comrade?”

Yao He countered, “Had it been anyone else, we would not interfere. But you heard him—he wishes to serve us, so he is now ours. Surely, Senior Sister, you understand?”

After a moment’s struggle, Zi Mo ground her teeth. “Very well. If Junior Brother and Junior Sister wish it, Senior Sister shall comply.”

Yao He beamed triumphantly, as if after a great victory.

Yang Kai finally ceased his cries and struggled to his feet, his clothes drenched in sweat. He bowed to Yao He and Yao Xi in thanks. “Thank you. I suffered greatly under that wench.”

Yao He looked at him meaningfully and nodded. “Senior Sister’s temper is indeed sharp, but you made the right choice. Follow us, and you will know what true hardship is.”

“Thank you,” Yang Kai fawned.

Bi Xiuming sneered at the Great Han martial artists. “A weathercock, swaying to whichever side blows. Does he not know that no matter whom he serves, death awaits?”

Yang Kai straightened again, grinning viciously at Zi Mo. “Wench, remove that insect or face my wrath!”

Such brazen arrogance!

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged satisfied glances.

They need not confront Zi Mo directly; Yang Kai’s treachery alone was enough to ruin her.

“All right, all right!” Zi Mo said, grief and anger mingling on her face. “If that is your wish, so be it. But know this: falling into their hands will yield no good end. You will die—soon enough. I hope you have no regrets.”

Yang Kai snorted, raising his head. “Spare us your meddling, wench. I do as I please. What are you going to do about it?”

Yao He and Yao Xi thought the foolish martial artist was hopelessly dense. Yet without his treachery, they would never have gained such advantage against Zi Mo.

They beamed, while the Great Han martial artists wanted nothing more than to bury their heads in the earth in shame. They, too, were from the Great Han, and to be outdone before these few from the Celestial Wolf—what disgrace!

Only Leng Shan stifled a cough and covered her mouth, her eyes betraying amused mirth. She admired Zi Mo and the siblings’ performance above all.

She also admired Yang Kai’s foresight. With this hurdle passed, the main act was about to begin. She quietly approached Han Xiao Qi of Wan Hua Palace and whispered into her ear.

Han Xiao Qi’s eyes gleamed with realization. She looked at Leng Shan in surprise, then nodded solemnly.

“I understand,” Han Xiao Qi murmured. She took a deep breath and quietly relayed the message to her three junior sisters.

“Stop dawdling,” Yang Kai urged impatiently. “I can’t wait to pledge my loyalty to Yao He and Yao Xi.”

Zi Mo gave him a long look, then stepped forward and pressed a hand on his abdomen.

Yang Kai blinked at Yao He. “They won’t kill me, will they?”

Yao He gave an icy smile. “Would Senior Sister do such a thing?”

“Good, good,” Yang Kai sighed with relief. Moments later, he retched up a Control Soul Insect.

Before Zi Mo could seize it, he pounced and began stamping on it, cursing profanely as he did, spittle flying in all directions.

Yao He and Yao Xi’s brows both twitched. Zi Mo’s face had turned grey, her slender form trembling with murderous intent as she glared at Yang Kai.

“That’s enough!” Yao He called out, unable to endure the fool any longer. “The Control Soul Insect’s nature makes it impossible to kill by stamping.”

“Oh, how disgraceful!”

Everyone felt their heads spin. Was this self-awareness or sheer absurdity?
