## Chapter 455 — Invasion

Yang Kai spoke as he strode directly to Xia Ningshang’s side without hesitation. Grasping her firmly, he lifted her up. Amid the startled exclamations of his little senior sister, he placed her comfortably on his lap. Only then did he leisurely turn to Lan Chudie, waiting for her response.

“Junior Brother...” Xia Ningshang’s voice was hesitant and uneasy. Helpless to break free from Yang Kai’s arms encircling her, her face flushed crimson. Her dense eyelashes fluttered, and she dared not meet anyone’s gaze, burying her head into his warm chest.

“What’s there to be afraid of? I said, none of us are outsiders here; there’s no need to feel awkward.” Yang Kai chuckled roguishly, wearing the full expression of a playful scoundrel.

Lan Chudie’s initially joyful expression gradually faded. She forced a smile and said, “I’d better not disturb you any longer.”

With that, she rose gracefully and took her leave.

Just as Xia Ningshang was about to speak and ask her to stay, Yang Kai quietly tickled her side. Xia Ningshang’s body stiffened instantly, and she dared not move. He had tickled her flat lower abdomen, a very sensitive spot.

His intention in acting this way before Lan Chudie was clear: to urge her departure. Time was precious, and he wished to spend more moments with his little senior sister without any interruptions.

After Lan Chudie left, Yang Kai waved his hand, sending a gentle breeze that softly closed the door behind her.

Outside, Lan Chudie’s smile froze into a bitter grimace. She saw through Yang Kai’s intentions clearly and felt the sting of awkwardness.

After all, she and Xia Ningshang were both Yang Kai’s senior sisters! They had all experienced the phases from strangers to acquaintances, from strangers to familiarity. But now, the weight they carried in Yang Kai’s heart was completely different.

The path of life often hinges on a single inadvertent choice that changes everything. Shaking her head slightly, Lan Chudie tightened her robes, suddenly noticing that the early autumn chill had begun to seep in.

Listening carefully and sensing Lan Chudie’s retreating footsteps, Xia Ningshang softly whispered like a buzzing mosquito, “Junior Brother, please put me down.”

“Isn’t this fine?” Yang Kai smiled brightly, gazing into her eyes.

“Mm...” Xia Ningshang responded softly, her cheeks aflame.

“You like me?” Yang Kai’s smile turned mischievous and wicked. His question was teasingly sharp and probing.

Xia Ningshang dared not answer and remained silent, her heartbeat pounding fiercely within her chest.

“Then I guess you don’t like me.” Yang Kai feigned a look of disappointment, sighing as if overwhelmed with grief.

“No, it’s not like that...” The little senior sister grew flustered, waving her hands anxiously with worried eyes.

Yang Kai suddenly burst into laughter.

Next door, Shopkeeper Meng rolled his eyes in disgust as an unexplainable frustration flared in his chest. He longed to storm over and give Yang Kai a fierce thrashing so brutal even his own mother wouldn’t recognize him.

How despicable, how rotten! To bully one’s meek, gentle, innocent, and adorable disciple so shamelessly was infuriating beyond words!

“Junior Brother, you’re just teasing me, right?” Xia Ningshang asked quietly, her cheek visibly puffed under the veil.

Yang Kai’s gaze softened as he stared at her. It seemed all the weariness from recent hardships vanished in that moment.

The little senior sister grew shy again and hastily changed the subject, “Junior Brother, you don’t like Senior Sister Lan, do you?”

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed. After a moment’s thought, he said, “It’s not that I don’t like her, I’m just trying to avoid contact with her as much as possible.”

“Why? I think Senior Sister Lan seemed quite concerned about you. She came looking for me earlier and talked a lot about you.”

“That’s exactly it,” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Let me put it this way — if I weren’t a member of the Yang Family, if I was still just a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, would you treat me differently, little senior sister?”

“No! No matter what, you are still my junior brother.”

“I know you won’t, but others might. Our Senior Sister Lan is like that. She cares about me mostly because of my status. If one day I am no longer part of the Yang Family, she might change her view again. Of course, this is just my personal guess and not a certainty. Still, I think it’s best to minimize my contact with her. I can’t say she’s wrong; it’s just that you, little senior sister, are too kind. People simply can’t be compared.”

Yang Kai shook his head slightly while explaining. Xia Ningshang listened, half understanding.

But Yang Kai knew she understood perfectly well. Though cute and innocent, little senior sister was no naive fool. Her kind heart would never view human intentions as utterly vile.

“Oh, where are my pills?” Yang Kai asked.

“They’re on the bed. I’ll get them for you.” Xia Ningshang jumped down from Yang Kai’s lap and walked over to the bed, taking out a bundle and placing it before him.

Opening the bundle revealed six bottles of pills.

“Three are for refining your True Essence — all Yang attribute pills. The other three are for cultivating Divine Sense strength,” Xia Ningshang said somewhat regretfully. “Time was tight, so I could only make these.”

“They’re enough.” Yang Kai was extremely satisfied. These pills were all lower-level Mystery-Grade.

Similar to the Hunyuan Pill, which should have been an upper-level Heaven-Grade pill, Xia Ningshang’s craftsmanship had upgraded their grade by one level to Mystery-Grade.

With the aid of Wan Yao Ling Ye, which could wash the meridians and marrow as well as improve pills’ grades if added during alchemy, combined with the spirit formation from the True Alchemy Formula, Xia Ningshang’s pill-making was effortless.

Without the assistance of Wan Yao Ling Ye and the spirit formation, given Xia Ningshang’s current skills, it would have been impossible to achieve this level in just half a month. Yang Kai also lacked the vast Mystery-Grade materials required for her to excel.

“Don’t overwork yourself.” Yang Kai looked at her somewhat tenderly.

“I’m not tired. Refining pills has steadily improved my strength; I’m about to reach the second stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. I only hope to refine many more pills so I can grow stronger quickly — not only to help you but to assist Master in the future,” Xia Ningshang said enthusiastically.

Alchemy was cultivation itself. The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body truly was extraordinary! Yang Kai whispered thoughtfully.

After chatting a while longer with Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai began to cultivate.

As usual, he first consumed the three Yang attribute pills, converting their medicinal efficacy into Yang Liquid to temper his True Essence. Then he used the three Mystery-Grade pills to explore the secrets of the True Alchemy Formula through trial and error.

The set of methods for cultivating Divine Sense strength that Shopkeeper Meng had taught him had been effective. With this help, Yang Kai felt his Divine Sense strength recovery was noticeably faster than before.

While Yang Kai cultivated, Xia Ningshang behaved obediently, sitting quietly nearby, recuperating, or resting on the bed.

This peaceful scene made Yang Kai recall their earlier days in the manor beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine, sparking a wave of nostalgia.

Two days later, Xia Ningshang returned again to the alchemy room to refine pills, and Yang Kai immediately felt a pang of loneliness.

Yet, as time passed, Yang Kai could distinctly feel his strength steadily growing. The ninth stage of the True Essence Realm was within reach, with only a slight barrier left to break.

The Divine Roaming Realm loomed close, and Yang Kai could not help but feel a thrill.

Reaching the Divine Roaming Realm meant he no longer needed to worry about the scrutiny of the eight monitors above this realm within War City.

Before the darkness at dawn, all was silent. Yang Kai was diligently probing the secrets of the True Alchemy Formula when suddenly, an unsettling sensation arose. He abruptly opened his eyes, brow furrowed as a tide of Divine Sense burst outward.

At the same moment, Yang Kai clearly sensed a faint Divine Sense emanating from next door — from Meng Wuya’s room. Compared to Yang Kai’s, this Divine Sense was almost imperceptible, yet its strength and presence could not be denied.

The two Divine Sense forces swept through the entire manor in an instant, both simultaneously locking onto one corner.

“Courting death!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, condensing all his Divine Sense power into a pinpoint before releasing a mysterious soul technique.

A purple shadow flickered through the darkness. An exclamation rang out as a frail and blurry figure suddenly appeared there.

“Who goes there!” The alerted guardian immediately raised the alarm, his shout echoing through Yang Kai’s manor.

In the next moment, multiple figures, their robes billowing, charged swiftly toward that location.

The faint figure’s face showed shock and disbelief, clearly not expecting to be discovered.

Without hesitation, water ripple-like patterns spread across his body, causing his figure to blur and distort.

Just as he was about to vanish, a ghostly silhouette darted forward first. Two shining daggers whirled viciously in the space around him within a range of several zhang, forming a deadly slaying dance.

Ying Jiu!

A muffled grunt sounded as the intruder’s body exploded violently.

Ying Jiu narrowed her eyes, quickly retreating. When she glanced again, the intruder was gone, leaving only a mist of water vapor dispersing in all directions.

From a position a hundred zhang away, a rainbow-like flash streaked rapidly away like lightning. Ying Jiu’s expression showed a trace of shock.

Such speed...

Countless figures landed swiftly. Yang Kai strode out boldly, glancing at the bloodstains on the ground and then toward the direction the invader fled, letting out a cold snort.

“What is all this commotion?” Qin Ze suddenly burst out from the alchemy room, face full of displeasure. When he noticed Yang Kai was also there, he reined in his anger, frowning slightly.

He too sensed something was wrong.

“Someone broke in. Did the disciples from Yao Wang Valley suffer any harm?” Yang Kai quickly asked.

“No,” Qin Ze shook his head.

Releasing and retracting his Divine Sense, Yang Kai felt relief — no casualties among the Yao Wang Valley disciples, and Xia Ningshang remained safe.

Yet... the alchemy room was the most heavily guarded area of the entire manor, yet someone had managed to infiltrate so deeply. Yang Kai’s expression turned cold and grim.

This was a slap in the face!

“Search immediately! See if we lost any people!” Yang Kai’s face darkened like a night before a storm, gloomy enough to terrify.
