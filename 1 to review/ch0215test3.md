## Chapter 1 — The Sweeper Boy

“Now you should understand why I said that killing there requires no reason or excuse, right? The blood beads obtained after killing are the best excuse and reason! There, a life is merely a stepping stone to becoming stronger, especially since you are only at the third layer of the **Separation and Union Realm**, making you easier to target,” **Ling Taixu** said in a deep voice.

**Yang Kai**’s expression revealed shock, but more than that, he felt excitement and joy.

**Ling Taixu**, with his keen insight, noticed **Yang Kai**’s expression and couldn’t help but sigh inwardly, thinking that this kid truly intends to prove his martial path through killing.

If it were another **Separation and Union Realm** third layer martial artist who heard such things, they would likely be frightened and avoid it. Yet, he instead looked eager, wishing he could immediately rush to that place and immerse himself in endless slaughter.

There, one need not worry about harming the innocent. Even if **Yang Kai** did not take the initiative to kill, there would still be people coming to kill him. Moreover, there were many evil martial artists there, all of whom deserved to die.

Along the way, **Ling Taixu** shared much information about that place with **Yang Kai**. After all, he had trained there many years ago and had personal experience, which was invaluable.

**Yang Kai** listened intently, not daring to miss a single detail.

According to **Ling Taixu**, that place was located in **Ghostly Underworld Mountain** but did not truly belong to **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**; it was a very peculiar **space**, and the entrance was in a lake within **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**.

No one knew what kind of peculiar energy and rules of heaven and earth existed inside. In any case, as long as a living being died there, all their energy and flesh essence would condense into blood beads, including both humans and demon beasts! These blood beads could be consumed by oneself or brought out for others to use, and they were quite valuable. Moreover, the stronger the person or demon beast that died, the higher the value of the blood beads, and the greater the enhancement they could provide.

Additionally, in that place, all offensive and defensive secret treasures would have no effect whatsoever, likely sealed by some invisible energy. Upon hearing this, **Yang Kai**’s heart sank significantly.

With his current strength at only the third layer of **Separation and Union Realm**, who knows how many **True Essence Realm** experts would flock to that place? If he encountered these experts, without the assistance of the **Shura Sword** or **Thousand Ruyi Blood Begonia**, he would surely be at a disadvantage and might even be killed.

However, thinking that others would be in the same situation, **Yang Kai** couldn’t help but feel a bit more balanced.

That strange place opened once every ten years, and **Yang Kai** was fortunate this time, having just returned to **Lingxiao Pavilion** in time. If he had returned a few months later, he would have surely missed it.

Finally, **Ling Taixu** solemnly handed **Yang Kai** a small cloth bag.

This bag was only about the size of a palm. It was engraved with many intricate patterns, made of strange materials, and looked quite exquisite.

“What is this?” **Yang Kai** asked in confusion.

“I call it the **the Spatial Pouch**. Don’t be fooled by its small size; it can actually hold a considerable amount of items,” **Ling Taixu** replied.

**Yang Kai** was once again moved. He looked at **Ling Taixu** in surprise, not expecting that even such a legendary secret treasure, used specifically for storage, would be in his possession.

“It’s all left behind by our ancestor. There’s probably only one of its kind in the entire **Great Han**, not even the eight great families among you possess one,” **Ling Taixu** said lightly.

Oh, wait, **Meng Wuya** might have one too, but that old thing hoards all treasures and gives none to anyone except his disciples, truly petty.

“I’ve prepared some **Pill** for you inside. Use them sparingly,” **Ling Taixu** advised.

“Thank you,师公! When I return, I will return this bag to you,” **Yang Kai** said as he carefully tucked the small bag into his chest.

This item was truly a supreme secret treasure, a treasure that could store things, which people only heard rumors about but had never seen.

However, **Yang Kai** had a wordless black book made from a **Soul-Calming Stone** inside him, which could also be used to refine storage treasures, and its grade was definitely much higher than that of the **the Spatial Pouch**.

Yet, **Yang Kai** now possessed a mountain of treasures but didn’t know how to utilize them, which was indeed a bit tragic.

After flying forward for about a day, a deep and continuous mountain range, exuding an eerie aura, appeared before **Ling Taixu** and **Yang Kai**.

**Ghostly Underworld Mountain**! The only forbidden place in **Great Han**! The desolate and ancient aura rushed toward them, as if this forbidden place were a giant dragon that had been lying here since ancient times, sending chills down one’s spine.

Before they could enter the mountain, a team suddenly rushed out from both sides.

On the left, there were six people. **Yang Kai** focused his gaze and found that they were all women. Leading them were an old woman and a beautiful matron, while the remaining four were all young girls.

The four young girls wore small bells on their hands and feet, and as they ran, the crisp and pleasant jingling sound rang out, like the clear spring water of a mountain stream, refreshing to the ears.

Moreover, this group of women all possessed extraordinary beauty. The beautiful matron was graceful and luxurious, with a plump figure, and her long black hair was styled into an updo, exposing her fair and slender neck, radiating a mature and alluring beauty. Especially her pair of eyes, which sparkled like autumn waves, captivating and enchanting, as if they could speak, making the sky bluer and the flowers smell sweeter.

The four young girls were even more charming, at the age of blossoming, graceful and delicate, with their pink arms half-exposed, each with skin as white as snow, outshining frost and snow. Their small, exquisite feet and delicate toes created a unique beauty, with their varying charms—some shy, some stunning, some cold as ice, and some warm as fire—gathered together, enough to drive any man mad. Although the young girls’ aura was not as mature and enticing as that of the beautiful matron, they had their own youthful and captivating charm.

As for the old woman, although she appeared very aged, one could still faintly see that she must have been exceptionally beautiful in her youth, but the merciless passage of time had etched many indelible marks on her face.

This group stopped about thirty zhang in front of **Yang Kai** and **Ling Taixu**. The old woman glanced at the two with indifference and let out a soft snort.

Clearly, those who came to **Ghostly Underworld Mountain** at this time all shared the same purpose.

The entrance to that peculiar space was limited, making them competitors.

**Ling Taixu** smiled slightly at the old woman and whispered to **Yang Kai**, “They are from the first-rate sect **Wan Hua Palace**. Young people are often impulsive, so be careful not to fall for these little girls’ tricks; otherwise, you won’t even get to spit out your bones.”

**Yang Kai**’s eyes sparkled as he scrutinized the four young girls. Hearing **Ling Taixu**’s words, he immediately straightened his expression, “师公, don’t worry, I will be careful.”

Moments later, the people on the right also arrived. Looking over, he saw that the leader was an old man of similar age to **Ling Taixu**, followed by three young people, both male and female, all possessing remarkable strength. However, regardless of gender, they all had a somewhat sinister aura.

The two young men were even bolder than **Yang Kai**, their eyes almost glued to the female disciples of **Wan Hua Palace**, which made the young girls beside them quite displeased, unable to hold back a snort.

“These are people from **Ghost King Valley**,” **Ling Taixu**’s expression darkened. “You’re in trouble now.”

“Why?” **Yang Kai** asked in confusion.

“Because I had a few encounters with that old man across from me in the past. This is an evil sect, so be careful of their skills,” **Ling Taixu** replied.

**Yang Kai** focused his gaze and indeed saw that the hands of the three people opposite had a strange appearance, lacking the usual flesh color, instead appearing ghostly pale, resembling terrifying ghost claws.

The old man from the opposite side suddenly let out a cold laugh, “**Ling Taixu**! You’re still alive!”

**Ling Taixu** snorted lightly, “**Gui Li**, you’re not dead either!”

“Good, good, good,” **Gui Li** grinned menacingly, “I was worried you’d die and I wouldn’t find anyone to take revenge on. I didn’t expect to run into you here today. Truly a blessing from the heavens.”

“What? Is the lesson from fifty years ago not enough for you? You want to seek death today?” **Ling Taixu** sneered, showing no fear.

**Gui Li**’s expression twisted, “What does it matter to bring up old matters? Fifty years ago, I lost to you, but that doesn’t mean I will lose again fifty years later!”

“Want to give it a try?” **Ling Taixu** smiled proudly.

**Gui Li**’s eyes were as eerie as ghost fire, staring at **Ling Taixu** with a hint of apprehension.

The two faced off, and the three disciples of **Ghost King Valley** behind **Gui Li** glared at **Yang Kai** as well.

**Yang Kai** grinned at them, his expression unchanged.

“Bang!” A sound echoed as the old woman from **Wan Hua Palace** struck her dragon-headed cane against the ground.

“If the two of you do not wish to fight, why don’t we discuss teaming up to enter **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**?” The old woman looked at **Ling Taixu** and **Gui Li** calmly.

Although **Ling Taixu** and **Gui Li** had grievances, they truly did not want to fight right now, as they were all here to train. If they missed the timing, it could ruin everything. The old woman was perceptive and saw that both needed a way out, which is why she suggested it.

**Gui Li** chuckled, “I’ll give you face, 顏宫主, and let this matter go for now. Once this is over, **Ling Taixu**, we will definitely have a battle!”

“Anytime!” 

**Gui Li**’s gaze was cold as he scrutinized **Yang Kai**, showing no intention of hiding his thoughts, and said to the three disciples beside him, “Remember this kid’s appearance. Kill him when we get inside!”

“Yes!” The three responded coldly.

**Yang Kai**’s expression turned cold, and he secretly memorized the appearances of these three.

With the old woman from **Wan Hua Palace** mediating, **Ling Taixu** and **Gui Li** temporarily set aside their grievances. The three quickly discussed, with the old woman leading the way, the four young girls following closely, **Gui Li** in the middle coordinating with his three disciples, while **Yang Kai** and **Ling Taixu** brought up the rear.

As for the beautiful matron, she was also in a central position, just that she was on the left while **Gui Li** was on the right.

With these four **Divine Roaming Realm** experts guarding them, the younger generation of disciples could be said to be extremely safe, provided that **Ling Taixu** and **Gui Li** did not play tricks on each other.

Naturally, **Ling Taixu** would not be so malicious, but it was hard to say the same for **Gui Li**. It was precisely because of this concern that the old woman had let **Ling Taixu** take the rear, to prevent **Gui Li** from launching a sneak attack from behind.

Fortunately, **Gui Li** was also a sensible person. As they proceeded, he did not make any moves, honestly staying in his position.

**Ghostly Underworld Mountain**, notorious for its danger, saw the group enter cautiously, holding their breath, as even at the outer edges, they might encounter powerful demon beasts of the fifth or sixth rank.

The women from **Wan Hua Palace** seemed to have used some means, as the bells on their wrists and ankles made no sound at this moment. The group moved silently.
