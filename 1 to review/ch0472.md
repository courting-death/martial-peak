## Chapter 472 — This Is Trouble

The middle-aged man’s expression grew complicated at the mention of the Young Master.

In truth, the relationship between himself and the Young Master was not so harmonious at its core. When they first met, he attempted to seize control of the Young Master’s body with his soul, only to be suppressed and branded with a soul Seal by the Young Master, thereby becoming controlled himself.

From then on, he lived under servitude. Though outwardly obedient and loyal, inwardly he constantly sought to break free from the Young Master’s domination and regain his freedom.

But as time passed, the middle-aged man gradually discovered the immense potential hidden within the Young Master. Although his memories had not fully returned, he still had sharp insight.

The Young Master was unlike ordinary martial artists. An array of mysterious auras enveloped him. Even after day and night spent in close proximity, the middle-aged man could not penetrate these mysteries; instead, he grew increasingly puzzled. This made him gradually suppress his rebellious thoughts and silently hope for the Young Master’s growth.

Later, beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine, when they found this demonic body, the Young Master entrusted his soul into it with great confidence.

Honestly, at that time, the middle-aged man was somewhat worried. He feared the Young Master would suspect him, and if he did not allow his soul to enter the demonic body, he might bear a grudge and attempt to shake off his control.

Fortunately, the Young Master consented.

This moved him to tears of gratitude!

On reflection, the Young Master actually treated him fairly well. For the sake of this demonic body, he resolved to assist him more. After all, his own soul still bore the Young Master’s Seal. If he angered him, his inevitable fate would be total annihilation.

Determined, the middle-aged man’s expression hardened. He no longer hesitated.

However… going there alone seemed somewhat unwise. If the Young Master inquired about his whereabouts, could he truthfully say he had lost himself in the Cangyun Evil Land, forgetting the promise carved into the stone wall?

Frowning thoughtfully, he immediately dispersed his vast Divine Sense.

He only intended to see if there was a convenient excuse nearby. But as his Divine Sense spread, it suddenly fluctuated—a familiar soul energy signal arrived from somewhere far off.

“Eh?” The middle-aged man’s face flickered with surprise and suspicion. Casting a glance in that direction, he suddenly recalled something. Chuckling softly, he enveloped himself in a black radiance and vanished like lightning.

About a hundred li away, a group of people was fleeing in panic.

Not too few, nor too many—around thirty or so. The leader was merely a Divine Roaming Realm Fourth Stage cultivator, and few among them were Divine Roaming Realm experts. Most were True Essence Realm martial artists.

Surrounding them, many figures sped along rapidly, encircling, but refraining from immediate attack, always keeping close pursuit.

The groups following them were not united; several separate teams were present, each wary of the others.

“These people are really annoying. We’ve been followed for over ten days and still can’t shake them off!” complained a beautiful young woman as she fled.

“This is trouble,” a nearby man smiled wryly. “At this rate, I’m afraid we won’t reach War City.”

“Senior Brother, what should we do?” the young woman asked anxiously.

“Take it one step at a time,” the man replied, clearly at a loss, continuing to rush after their sect elders.

While they spoke, a cold-looking woman approached. Slender and graceful, her appearance was that of a rare beauty. Yet oddly, her delicate hands were tightly bound by white ribbons, completely obscuring their true form.

Not only her—many among them wrapped their hands in white bands, as if hiding some unspeakable secret.

“Senior Brother Tao, if things get worse, let’s split up here,” the woman said, her beautiful eyes flashing with cold light. After days of pursuit, she had finally lost patience. “Their real target is our Ghost King Valley. If we separate, they won’t bother your Baoqi Sect.”

Tao Yang shook his head. “Junior Sister Leng, you’re thinking far too simply. Do you really believe these people are only after Ghost King Valley?”

“Not entirely, but we are partly responsible,” Leng Shan’s expression darkened. She was no fool. She knew the reason these pursuers hadn’t launched a direct attack or uttered threats was to avoid offending Baoqi Sect.

Ghost King Valley was merely their legitimate excuse.

This time, things had gone wrong!

Months ago, news of the succession war in Zhongdu reached the Cangyun Evil Land. Naturally, Ghost King Valley heard the rumors.

Like Chen Xueshu and the others, Leng Shan became suspicious upon hearing the name Yang Kai, uncertain if the youngest scion of the Yang Family was the same person she knew.

After various inquiries, she confirmed the truth.

Holding a high rank in Ghost King Valley, Leng Shan petitioned Gui Li to allow her to lead sect members to participate in the succession war.

Gui Li refused.

After all, Ghost King Valley was a sect of Cangyun Evil Land. Its disciples would bear no good fate if they rashly left. How could he dare take part in Zhongdu’s Yang Family succession war?

Not only did he refuse, but he also locked up Leng Shan, ordering her not to leave unless she reached Divine Roaming Realm.

Later, Senior Brother Shen Yi and Cheng Ying helped her escape secretly. The three gathered several comrades who had received Yang Kai’s help before in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave and quietly left Ghost King Valley for Zhongdu.

All this was to repay Yang Kai’s repeated lifesaving efforts. Without him at the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, those disciples from Ghost King Valley would have died countless times over.

But Ghost King Valley disciples bore unmistakable marks.

Their bone-pale, bloodless hands betrayed their origins in an evil sect; outsiders would kill them on sight if recognized.

So, to conceal their identity, many wrapped their hands in white cloth. Though strange in appearance, it helped them hide.

Aside from Leng Shan, none of the young people had ventured far beyond Cangyun Evil Land. Outside its borders, they fled like headless flies.

After some thought, Shen Yi decided to seek out Tao Yang in Baoqi Sect. Using Baoqi Sect’s protection, they would go together to Zhongdu.

He figured Tao Yang and the others of Baoqi Sect would surely come to Yang Kai’s aid.

Tao Yang had already received a messenger from Yang Kai but had been unable to persuade the elder sect members. Alone with just their few acquaintances who were Yang Kai’s fellow disciples, they could barely make an impact.

When the Ghost King Valley group arrived at Baoqi Sect, Tao Yang was overwhelmed with joy upon seeing Leng Shan and Shen Yi. He quickly arranged for them to stay quietly within the sect.

In the following days, Leng Shan and the others worked tirelessly, pleading repeatedly with Baoqi Sect’s elders. After much effort, they finally convinced them to set out immediately.

No sooner had they left Baoqi Sect than several groups began to track them.

Outside Baoqi Sect, the atmosphere was lively every day, much like in Yao Wang Valley. Countless martial artists came seeking to refine their weapons. But these tracking teams seemed unusual—they only followed and didn’t send messages, raising suspicion.

After a day of pursuit, a Divine Roaming Realm master within Baoqi Sect could no longer bear it and directly inquired. He learned those groups were messengers sent by several Yang Family scions to recruit support.

With Yao Wang Valley factions now under Yang Kai's command, Baoqi Sect’s refined weapon experts had become valuable assets.

Yang Zhao, Yang Kang, Yang Shen, Yang Ying, and even Yang Wei had each sent envoys.

Naturally, Tao Yang and company refused their overtures.

After rejection, these groups remained undeterred. Vigilant toward one another, they relentlessly trailed them—if they couldn’t recruit Baoqi Sect, they wouldn’t allow others to succeed either.

After several days, an opportunity arose.

A Ghost King Valley disciple accidentally exposed their identity, instantly stirring the pursuers to action.

“Mr. Wu, if you hand over those from Ghost King Valley, we will not trouble your sect. After all, your sect’s forging techniques are unrivaled. We may require your help in the future!” An expert at Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage from the left group smiled slyly.

This statement garnered many nods of agreement, with tacit hints that if Baoqi Sect surrendered the Ghost King Valley disciples, their collusion with an evil sect would remain secret.

Leading from the front, Wu Yan snorted disdainfully, refusing to respond.

He saw their intentions clearly and was full of contempt.

“Tao Yang! Come here!” Wu Yan shouted irritably.

Tao Yang immediately hurried forward, respectfully asking, “Senior Aunt, what orders do you have?”

Wu Yan sneered twice. “You’re getting braver, letting those from Ghost King Valley in! What am I to say about you?”

Wu Yan had only learned their true identity after the Ghost King Valley disciple’s slip a few days prior.

If he had known earlier, Baoqi Sect’s elders would never have allowed Leng Shan and company inside.

Tao Yang laughed casually. “They saved our lives, Senior Aunt. When Zhao Rong and I went to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, it was thanks to their care that we survived; otherwise, we’d all be dead.”

Wu Yan narrowed his eyes. “Wasn’t it Yang Kai who saved you? How has it turned into Ghost King Valley folks? Which is the truth?”

“They helped us all the same,” Tao Yang replied carelessly. “Besides, Senior Aunt, Baoqi Sect is like Yao Wang Valley—open for business; friends from all corners of the world. Why should we fret over whether someone is from an evil sect?”

“Hmph! You’ve stirred up trouble. You’d better fix it yourself, or I’ll expel you from the sect when we return!”

“Don’t, Senior Aunt! I’m trying to figure out how,” Tao Yang said, suddenly crestfallen.

“You’d better.”
