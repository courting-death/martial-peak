## Chapter 247 — Making a Fool of Oneself

With this thought, Yao He said to Yao Xi, “Xi’er, you use the Blood Pearls first.”

A wave of emotion and tenderness appeared on Yao Xi’s face. She nodded slightly, then lifted her delicate face to look toward the Great Han martial artists, commanding imperiously, “Gather the Blood Pearls for me!”

Seventeen or eighteen people exchanged glances, each unwilling to move.

They had suffered many humiliations under Yao He and Yao Xi during this time, burning with hatred and wishing to reduce them to dust and ashes. How could they be willing to help?

But with orders given, delaying was not an option. If they angered them, more torment and disaster would surely follow.

Ye Han of Wan Hua Palace stood up angrily, his small tiger teeth gleaming as he ground them and said through clenched teeth, “I’ll go!”

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered, and he reached out to pull her back. “Let me go. You rest.”

Bi Xiuming, who had been meditating, suddenly opened his eyes and chuckled lowly, “What? Just tamed and already eager to show loyalty? Even such a task you want to rush to do?”

“Indeed. Under the roof, one must bow,” Yang Kai chuckled and stood.

Bi Xiuming and his junior brother sneered, their faces full of contempt, causing many to frown in displeasure.

They walked around the places where the Demonic Beasts had died, collecting thirty or forty Blood Pearls, then strode to stand before the three in Senluo Palace.

Yao Xi looked at Yang Kai coldly, her expression wary.

After all, Yang Kai was brought by Zi Mo, so Yao Xi had to be cautious.

“Throw the Blood Pearls over!” When Yang Kai approached within about three zhang, Yao Xi said coldly, not allowing him any closer.

Yang Kai nodded, using a subtle force to continuously toss over more than thirty Blood Pearls one by one, all caught without a miss by Yao Xi.

Zi Mo watched coldly and only spoke after Yao Xi finished collecting the Blood Pearls, “Now you have your wish. If there is nothing else, I will leave first.”

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged a glance, both smiling lightly. “Senior Sister, where do you intend to go?”

Zi Mo’s expression changed, her voice stern, “Where I go is none of your concern!”

Yao Xi laughed coquettishly, “Senior Sister, your temper is still as fierce as ever. We only consider your safety. This place is perilous, and without Demonic Beasts guarding you, if you go out and something happens, how could we explain it to Master?”

Zi Mo looked at them incredulously, “You even want to control me?”

Yao He said, “Senior Sister, we are family. We should look after each other.”

Yao Xi nodded as well, “Yes, for your safety, Junior Sister thinks it’s best you stay.”

A cold smile appeared at Zi Mo’s lips, her face filled with sorrow. On the way here, Yang Kai had already told her that Yao He and Yao Xi were likely to go all out, to make things irreversible.

Since they dared to harm your Demonic Beasts, they would not hesitate to harm you!

That was what Yang Kai told her.

Zi Mo had held onto a sliver of hope, but now it seemed Yang Kai’s words were absolutely correct.

In a place like this, killing Zi Mo would leave no trace if handled properly afterward. As for the Great Han martial artists, they would all be silenced. Why should Yao He and Yao Xi fear?

First cut off her Demonic Beasts, then make her the target. Everything matched Yang Kai’s deductions exactly. Whether to call it foresight or a deep understanding of human treachery was uncertain.

Zi Mo fell silent, her gaze growing colder.

Suddenly, Yao Xi frowned and turned to Yang Kai, scolding him without courtesy, “What are you standing here for? Go back quickly!”

Then she looked at Zi Mo with disdain, “Senior Sister, is this how you teach your subordinates? No manners at all.”

Zi Mo said nothing, but Yang Kai gave an awkward smile and carefully cupped his fists toward her. His eyes flicked toward Zi Mo, his expression turning venomous as he said, “Could you two get this wretch to remove that insect from my body? I’m willing to abandon darkness and pledge loyalty to you.”

Zi Mo suddenly turned sharply toward Yang Kai, teeth clenched, “What did you just call me?”

“A wretch! What’s wrong?” Yang Kai straightened his back, standing defiantly.

“Heh...” Zi Mo laughed bitterly in anger, “Dare to call me that? You must have forgotten who is in charge here.”

These words were once spoken by Yang Kai to her, now returned in kind.

“The lesson I gave you before wasn’t enough!” Zi Mo’s killing intent surged as she scolded sharply. Yang Kai immediately writhed on the ground in pain, clutching his stomach and rolling, shouting to Yao He and Yao Xi, “Help! I truly want to serve you both, willing to sacrifice my life!”

The commotion naturally drew the attention of the Great Han martial artists.

Hearing Yang Kai’s shameless words, those with some acquaintance with him could not help but show a pained expression, especially the four girls of Wan Hua Palace. Han Xiao Qi frowned, clearly not expecting Yang Kai to be so spineless.

But Bi Xiuming and his junior brother laughed loudly after a moment’s surprise, “What did he say? He wants to pledge loyalty to those two? Ha ha ha... That task he grabbed earlier was really to show loyalty. I knew he was so eager, just as I thought!”

They spat contemptuously on the ground.

Utter humiliation, pure humiliation! Though these Great Han martial artists were also controlled, none had ever begged so lowly as Yang Kai.

Yang Kai continued his pitiful cries, as if unaware of his disgrace, “Help! For the sake of my loyalty, save me!”

Yao He and Yao Xi clearly did not expect such a spectacle.

Zi Mo was their target, Yang Kai was brought by Zi Mo, yet now the two sides were turning on each other.

Wonderful, truly wonderful!

Not to save Yang Kai’s life, but to strike at Zi Mo’s arrogance, Yao He and Yao Xi could no longer watch. If this spineless Great Han martial artist continued, he would become useless.

“Senior Sister, stop,” Yao Xi said with a proud expression, suppressing a smile.

Zi Mo looked up, her eyes icy, “What? You want to interfere when I discipline my own subordinates?”

Yao He said, “If it were others, we wouldn’t interfere. But Senior Sister, you heard him. He wants to serve us, so now he belongs to us. You won’t be unreasonable, will you?”

The two exchanged glances. Zi Mo gasped and after a long moment, gritted her teeth, “Fine, since Junior Brother and Junior Sister want it, as Senior Sister, I shall comply!”

Yao He smiled as if victorious, full of pride.

Yang Kai, still rolling on the ground, finally stopped screaming and struggling. His clothes drenched with sweat, he staggered up and cupped his fists to Yao He and Yao Xi, grateful, “Thank you both. These days under that wretch’s hand were truly harsh.”

Yao He looked at him meaningfully and nodded, “Yes, Senior Sister’s temper is bad, but you made the right choice. Follow us, and you won’t suffer.”

“Thank you both, thank you both!” Yang Kai became even more obsequious.

Bi Xiuming sneered from the Great Han martial artists, “A fence-sitter, trying to please both sides. Doesn’t he know that whoever he falls to, death is inevitable?”

Yang Kai straightened his back again, grinning fiercely at Zi Mo, “Wretch, get that insect out of me, or you’ll regret it!”

A perfect display of a fox assuming the tiger’s might!

Using the tiger’s skin as a banner, that was the meaning.

Yao He and Yao Xi grew even more proud.

They no longer needed to confront Zi Mo directly. Yang Kai’s betrayal alone was enough to disgrace her.

“Fine, fine!” Zi Mo was heartbroken and furious, clearly deeply angered, “If you want it, so be it! But... do you think falling into their hands will end well? Death awaits sooner or later. I hope you won’t regret it then!”

Yang Kai flared his nostrils arrogantly, “Mind your own business, wretch. I’m happy to have you meddle. Come and bite me if you dare!”

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged a glance, thinking this Great Han martial artist was a fool and an idiot. But if he were not, he would not be so foolish as to openly defy Zi Mo.

The Yao siblings were pleased in their hearts. The Great Han martial artists wished they could bang their heads on the ground. Though their ties with Yang Kai were not deep, they felt deeply ashamed. All were from Great Han, yet causing such a scene before the few from Tianlang was disgraceful!

Only Leng Shan coughed lightly, covering her mouth, a faint smile of amusement flashing in her eyes.

She truly admired the acting skills of Zi Mo and the two.

She admired Yang Kai’s prior planning and scheming even more, now that things unfolded almost exactly as he predicted.

Leng Shan knew that once this hurdle was passed, the real drama would begin. She quietly approached Han Xiao Qi of Wan Hua Palace and whispered in her ear.

Han Xiao Qi’s eyes flashed with sharp light, looking at Leng Shan in surprise. The latter nodded seriously.

“I understand,” Han Xiao Qi took a deep breath, a faint smile appearing at the corner of her mouth. She then conveyed what she heard to her three junior sisters.

“Come on, what are you dawdling for?” Yang Kai urged, as if eager to pledge allegiance to Yao He and Yao Xi.

Zi Mo scrutinized him deeply, then stepped forward, pressing a hand on Yang Kai’s abdomen.

Yang Kai blinked and said to Yao He, “Will she take this chance to finish me off?”

Yao He sneered, “Senior Sister would never do such a thing.”

“That’s good, that’s good,” Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief. Moments later, his face turned grim as he vomited out a Control Soul Insect.

Before Zi Mo could put the insect away, he rushed forward, stomping wildly on it, cursing with vile and coarse words, spitting everywhere.

Yao He and Yao Xi’s brows twitched in irritation. Zi Mo’s face turned iron blue, her delicate body trembling, eyes blazing with killing intent as she stared at Yang Kai.

“Enough!” Yao He was already fed up with Yang Kai’s stupidity and shouted, “The Control Soul Insect’s constitution is unique; you can’t kill it by stomping.”

“Oh, making a fool of myself, making a fool of myself!”

Everyone felt dizzy. Should they say he had self-awareness or what?
