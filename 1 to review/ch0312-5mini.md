## Chapter 312 — Any Request?

Bilo had once set her sights on Fenghuan Tower as well, but after months of wheedling and pleading before Shan Qingluo, she had never been granted permission...

Yet now, a man of no renown was to be lodged in Fenghuan Tower, and Bilo’s heart was instantly filled with shocked jealousy.

What sort of background did this brat have to be held in such regard by the lady?

Her astonishment was plain as her beautiful eyes kept darting over Yang Kai with a look of envy and disbelief.

“You’ve been traveling; you must be tired. Rest early tonight. Once I finish what I need to do, I’ll come and speak with you,” Shan Qingluo said with a faint, charming smile.

Yang Kai wore a cold expression, shot her a look, and said nothing.

When one lived under another’s roof, one had no choice but to bow.

Bilo was about to clap her hands and call more maidservants over, but Shan Qingluo said, “You personally escort him to Fenghuan Tower.”

Bilo blinked, surprise deepening on her face, then nodded, “Yes!”

Shan Qingluo leaned close and told Yang Kai softly, “You brat, don’t bully her. Bilo was raised by me; she is like a sister to me.”

“I know.” Yang Kai replied in a curt tone.

“Go.”

Bilo led Yang Kai through the palace corridors.

Trailing behind the coquettish girl, Yang Kai took in his surroundings. Shan Qingluo’s residence was indeed tranquil. Though the city outside was prosperous and bustling, within these walls no stray noise intruded; a fragrant scent threaded the air throughout, and every path was swept spotless.

They passed a few pretty maidservants who respectfully bowed to Bilo and eyed Yang Kai with curiosity.

Throughout the walk, they encountered not a single man.

Soon they arrived at Fenghuan Tower.

A tasteful pavilion, three levels in all, neither large nor small but possessing its own charms. The courtyard before it had been planted with many flowers; in the season of blooming, their scents were overwhelming.

“Hey…” Bilo called as she led the way, “Mind your step and don’t trample the flowers — these were planted by the lady herself. If you ruin them, I’ll make you pay!”

“Mm.” Yang Kai answered indifferently, knowing the girl bore him a grudge and choosing not to take her tone to heart.

What kind of person was he, anyway? Bilo’s heart secretly chafed; by his appearance and bearing he did not seem noble. How could the lady hold him in such high esteem?

And the lady had even cautioned him not to bully Bilo!

Could he beat her? Bilo’s thoughts churned.

If not for Shan Qingluo’s special favor toward Yang Kai, Bilo would have been tempted to spar with him and teach him a lesson.

They went up to the pavilion and climbed to the second level. Bilo opened the door and darted inside. Her pretty face lit with joy; she paid no heed to Yang Kai, instead flopping onto a fragrant soft bed and spreading herself out like a star, clutching a pillow to her chest and inhaling deeply.

As she sniffed, a look of utter bliss suffused her face.

This was the bedding the lady had slept on, the pillow the lady had rested her head upon. It still bore her scent…

Bilo felt light-headed and her cheeks flushed.

Yang Kai frowned while watching her, unable to hide a faint amusement. The girl clearly worshipped Shan Qingluo to an irrational degree.

Her position on the bed only emphasized the graceful curve of her hips.

Yang Kai surveyed the boudoir and nodded, “Not bad.”

Bilo sprang up as if awakened, her eyes wide. “Not bad?”

Yang Kai nodded as if it were obvious. This was a woman’s chamber; his lodging here would seem at odds, so calling it “not bad” was a fair compliment.

“Hmph… it is indeed not bad!” Bilo bit her lip and said hotly, “This is where the lady used to sleep when she was young. I begged and pleaded for ages to move in and she wouldn’t allow it. And now some stinking brat of unknown origin can come in — and you’re not even grateful, you just say ‘not bad’?”

“Uh…” Yang Kai looked taken aback and finally understood the depth of her animosity.

He scratched his nose awkwardly. “Miss Bilo, do you have some misunderstanding about me?”

“You think you’re somebody!” Bilo snapped, hoisting the scented pillow and stomping toward the door.

“Why take the pillow?” Yang Kai was speechless.

“This was used by the lady.” Bilo turned in anger and then stormed back, throwing the bedcover into her arms as well. Like a little boss in a rage, she glared at Yang Kai before strutting out.

Yang Kai watched her go, surprised. He now knew Bilo’s devotion to Shan Qingluo went beyond fondness and verged on obsession.

He paid it no mind and sat cross-legged on the bed to meditate.

He could not linger in Piaoxiang City for long — the method Shan Qingluo cultivated was deadly; to remain here would mean dying on her doorstep sooner or later.

But now that the bewitching woman had regained strength, Yang Kai could not leave even if he wanted to.

He cursed himself for his own misfortune. Had he known, he never would have given her the Wan Yao Ling Paste, but at that time circumstances had left him no choice. He had escaped one trap only to walk into another.

Moreover, the seal the seductress had placed within his body had clearly been meant for tracking.

To leave, he first had to deal with that seal.

He closed his eyes and probed the inside of his body.

Though his cultivated Divine Sense could not peer inward, he could still discern the state of his body with ease.

In short order, Yang Kai felt a faint but distinct energy attached along his ribs in the chest and abdomen — like a maggot clinging to a bone.

He tried to drive it out with True Yang Primordial Qi but to no avail.

Even the Unyielding Will Golden Body’s purifying power could not dispel it.

It lay there attached. It harmed his body not at all and did not hinder the flow of his True Essence, but such an energy was like a bright lamp in the darkness — Shan Qingluo could easily sense his location.

If only the Earth Demon were here! It could identify this energy, but ever since it entered the demonic body beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine, there had been no word of it.

As he concentrated, Yang Kai suddenly sensed a thread of Divine Sense drift close.

“You little brat. What are you doing?” Shan Qingluo’s voice came, at once teasing and delighted.

“Sleeping!” Yang Kai rolled his eyes and cursed inwardly; he had suspected the energy she left behind was troublesome but had not imagined it would immediately draw her attention.

Shan Qingluo laughed sweetly. “Don’t bother, then. That is my Soul Pursuit Seal. Unless I personally remove it, not even a top peak master of the Divine Roaming Realm can break it. With that mark on you, no matter how far you flee, I will find you.”

“That’s unnecessary.” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

“Giggling…” Shan Qingluo chuckled softly. “If you had kept your hands to yourself, would I have treated you like this? Well then, rest for the night. I promise I’ll come and see you tomorrow — I won’t let you be bored.”

“Spare me.”

“You’re so heartless and ungrateful!” Shan Qingluo hummed and withdrew her Divine Sense.

With no other option, Yang Kai abandoned any hope of shattering the Soul Pursuit Seal and resigned himself to a night’s rest.

The next morning, Yang Kai was roused from meditation by footsteps below.

Shortly after, someone knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

The door opened and a graceful, well-formed beauty glided in, a beguiling smile playing on her lips.

It was hard to tell her exact age, but she was no older than twenty-five. Her figure was full and ripe; her peach-blossom eyes always seemed to glimmer with temptation. Her skin was pale and delicate. Though not quite matching Shan Qingluo, she was nearly as alluring — all of them exuded a ripe, intoxicating charm as if pressing them would make them burst with juice.

Compared to Shan Qingluo, this woman’s sensuality was heavier; Shan Qingluo felt more tender.

She smiled at Yang Kai and, lips parting, asked softly, “Young master, did you rest well last night?”

“Fine.” Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

She stepped forward and, standing beside the bed, bowed lightly, her breath like orchid. “I am the lady’s handmaid sent to serve you. You may call me Yunli.”

“And these two girls.” Yunli introduced herself then motioned behind her, bringing forward two maidens of differing temperaments.

One looked gentle and placid; the other bore a composed, refined bearing.

The three — Yunli and the two girls — shared the beauty of flowers and moonlight; each was perfect to the eye.

“This is Ruoyu,” Yunli said, pointing to the gentle girl, then indicated the stately maiden. “This is Ruoqing.”

“Greetings, young master.” They bowed, their bearing and dress equal to young ladies of the great families.

Yang Kai’s expression hardened. He had no idea what game Shan Qingluo played; these three differed in temperament, but any one of them could awaken a man’s desire to possess.

Setting aside Ruoyu and Ruoqing, even Yunli’s charms put her only a hair’s breadth below Shan Qingluo, and she possessed what the younger girls lacked — a voluptuous body and those perpetually seductive peach-blossom eyes.

Was this an attempt to throw him into the snares of indulgence? Yang Kai’s heart pounded.

Yunli smiled. “The lady said that during your time in Piaoxiang City, all your daily needs and assorted matters will be handled by us.”

“Thank you.” Yang Kai replied dryly.

“It is our duty. Young master is the lady’s honored guest,” Yunli beamed, a blush briefly rising to her cheek. “The lady also said that whatever the young master requests, we must satisfy.”

“Anything I ask?” Yang Kai’s heart stirred as he read the implication.

Yunli nodded gently. Even Ruoyu and Ruoqing grew shy, their gazes faltering and unable to meet Yang Kai’s eyes; they appeared slightly nervous.
