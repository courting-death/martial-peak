## Chapter 299 — Breaking the Alluring Arts

Yang Kai pressed his lips together, secretly observing the changes on Shan Qing Luo's side, his heart filled with vigilance.

From her few words, it was not difficult for Yang Kai to deduce that this was a critical moment for her, and it was equally a critical moment for himself.

She had brought him here merely as a precaution; once she could no longer resist the temptation of breaking through her cultivation method, he would undoubtedly be taken by her. As for the outcome... it was obvious that it would not be good; otherwise, why would she have so seriously warned him?

Yang Kai's expression darkened as he contemplated his escape.

Suddenly, a radiant light surged within the cave. Looking up, he saw Shan Qing Luo's delicate body surging with True Essence, visible streams of energy bursting forth from her acupoints. These streams of True Essence, upon contact with the air, seemed to undergo a tremendous transformation, turning into shimmering white threads.

These threads, countless and intricate, hung around Shan Qing Luo's body, wrapping her completely.

As time passed, the threads grew more numerous and denser.

Yang Kai's brows twitched as he watched.

These threads... felt very much like spider silk, yet also resembled silkworm silk, each one filled with elasticity and toughness, each containing surging energy.

In just half an hour, Shan Qing Luo was entirely enveloped by these threads, her enchanting beauty vanished, and her graceful figure hidden within them.

All Yang Kai could see was a white oval resembling a silkworm cocoon.

It was as if a tent had enveloped Shan Qing Luo, her beautiful figure reflected dimly on one side of the oval, hazy and indistinct.

A faint fragrance gradually spread throughout the cave. Inhaling the scent, Yang Kai's heartbeat quickened, his blood began to boil, and his breathing grew heavier.

The body fragrance emanating from Shan Qing Luo was undeniably the purest aphrodisiac!

Sensing something was amiss, he quickly operated the True Yang Technique, firmly maintaining his composure.

The more he resisted, the harder it became.

Just as he was struggling, a series of suppressed moans and murmurs unexpectedly came from Shan Qing Luo's direction.

Upon hearing the sounds, Yang Kai's eyes instantly became vacant and hollow.

The surrounding scenery shifted; the dim cave vanished, the flickering flames disappeared, and the shimmering white cocoon along with Shan Qing Luo also simultaneously vanished.

His surroundings suddenly transformed into a room filled with fragrant air and fluttering petals. The ground beneath him was covered with a layer of luxurious red carpet.

A series of giggles filled his ears. Looking around, he saw himself surrounded by a dozen young maidens dressed in revealing attire. These maidens were only covered by thin veils over their key areas, their delicate beauty barely concealed.

Seductive melodies rang out as the maidens smiled sweetly at Yang Kai, dancing around him.

These young maidens varied in figure, some slender and some plump, yet each one was stunningly beautiful, pure and untainted, some shy and innocent, others bold and fiery, some alluring and enchanting, and others elegant and serene...

As the maidens danced around Yang Kai, they gazed at him with affectionate eyes, showcasing their most captivating sides, their throats emitting suppressed moans, their red lips moving with boundless desire.

Yang Kai's breath quickened suddenly!

This decadent and obscene scene seemed capable of unearthing the deepest desires hidden within a person, turning them into a mindless beast.

A low growl escaped his throat. Yang Kai disregarded everything and grabbed one of the maidens beside him, throwing her to the ground amidst her startled screams.

The maiden's beautiful brows furrowed slightly, enduring the pain, yet still gazing at Yang Kai with tender affection. Soft moans escaped her lips as she wrapped her delicate arms around his neck.

Yang Kai grinned at her. In the midst of his struggle, he punched her in the head.

As the punch landed, all the maidens around vanished.

Yang Kai's clothes were instantly drenched in sweat, and a chill ran through his heart.

This enchanting and delightful illusion truly tested a person's mental fortitude. Fortunately, although Yang Kai was affected, he managed to regain clarity at a critical moment.

He thought he had broken free from this illusion, but when Yang Kai stood up again, he found that the previous scene had not changed. Although the maidens were gone, a fragrant bed draped with curtains had mysteriously appeared in the great hall.

On the bed lay a voluptuous woman, lazily reclining, one hand propping up her head, smiling sweetly at him.

Through the hazy curtains, Yang Kai could see that she seemed to be wearing only a thin, gauzy silk.

Light giggles floated from that direction as the woman on the bed gently waved at Yang Kai, her whispers filled with an irresistible allure, pulling his recently regained consciousness back into the mire.

With crimson eyes and heavy breaths, he approached the bed, roughly tearing open the pink curtains.

What came into view was Shan Qing Luo, reclining on the fragrant bed. This enchanting woman had a plump figure, her skin glistening and flawless, her curves exquisite, her ample hips prominently raised, with a cascade of blue hair partially covering her, outlining her perfect silhouette, stirring one's blood.

She giggled softly, slowly rising, her eyes filled with myriad charms, pulling Yang Kai onto the bed, gently laying him down.

Yang Kai remained unresponsive, allowing her to manipulate him.

Shan Qing Luo gazed at him with affectionate eyes, straddling him, slowly removing his clothes, her face flushed with a rosy hue, appearing both shy and eager.

As she loosened his clothes, her breath fragrant as orchids, Shan Qing Luo gasped, biting her red lips, gently swaying her hips, gradually lowering herself.

A soft, moist sensation enveloped Yang Kai, causing his eyes to suddenly tremble.

The Dual Cultivation Technique involuntarily activated, a fierce suction suddenly emanating from below.

Shan Qing Luo, seated atop him, let out a piercing scream, and all illusions instantly shattered.

With a jolt, Yang Kai opened his eyes, drenched in sweat, sitting upright in place, gasping heavily.

Looking up, he saw that not far away, Shan Qing Luo was still within that pure white cocoon, and he did not know how much time had passed outside. However, the Dual Cultivation Technique was still in operation, vast and pure energy surged from the white cocoon, pouring into Yang Kai's meridians.

The dragon's head below him was raised high, looking quite impressive.

Yang Kai took a few deep breaths, gradually calming the tumultuous blood within him.

He did not know why that illusion had suddenly collapsed. But he was certain that it was all related to the Dual Cultivation Technique.

The Dual Cultivation Technique was a method of dual cultivation, which should have restrained Shan Qing Luo's alluring arts, allowing him to successfully escape from that illusion.

After trying for a while, he found that he still could not move, and a sense of resentment arose in his heart.

There was no need to rush; although Shan Qing Luo appeared ruthless, she was not difficult to deal with, and she did not seem to have any intention of killing him.

Once he calmed down, Yang Kai simply ignored everything else, wholeheartedly operating the Dual Cultivation Technique.

Under the guidance of the Dual Cultivation Technique, streams of energy were separated from the white cocoon where Shan Qing Luo resided, pouring into Yang Kai's meridians and Dantian. Gradually, Yang Kai felt as if he had developed a subtle connection with Shan Qing Luo within the cocoon.

As time passed, this feeling grew stronger.

Suddenly, a gasp broke the silence.

Yang Kai quickly opened his eyes, only to see Shan Qing Luo staring at him with her enchanting eyes, looking at him in disbelief.

"Eh..." Yang Kai was taken aback.

"How did you get in here?" Shan Qing Luo's small mouth opened slightly.

"What?" Yang Kai frowned, suspiciously surveying his surroundings, only to find that he had somehow ended up sitting opposite Shan Qing Luo, surrounded by a vast ocean.

"No, this is Divine Sense; you have entered my Sea of Consciousness!" Shan Qing Luo exclaimed in shock, her beautiful face filled with horror. "How did you breach my Sea of Consciousness?"

"I don't know," Yang Kai shook his head, looking down and realizing that he indeed had no physical body, merely his Divine Sense inadvertently intruding into her Sea of Consciousness.

Curiously observing the vast ocean below, it seemed that the seawater contained a surging destructive power. Yang Kai couldn't help but exclaim, "So this is your Sea of Consciousness..."

"Get out quickly!" Shan Qing Luo urged.

Within a person's Sea of Consciousness lies all their secrets; once the Sea of Consciousness is pried into, that person's secrets would have nowhere to hide.

Thus, everyone would guard their Sea of Consciousness well.

Moreover, intruding into another's Sea of Consciousness was not a simple task. Not to mention some defensive soul treasures, there were also special soul techniques that could prevent others' Divine Sense from intruding.

As a master like Shan Qing Luo, how could she lack soul treasures? How could she not have cultivated defensive soul techniques?

Yet, she had still been silently breached by Yang Kai into her Sea of Consciousness.

In shock, seeing Yang Kai still lingering in her Sea of Consciousness, looking around, she couldn't help but feel anxious and angry, gritting her teeth, "If you don't leave, I will make you stay here forever!"

Yang Kai was startled and quickly replied, "No, I'll leave! I’ve never seen what a Sea of Consciousness looks like; I just wanted to take a look."

As he spoke, he hurriedly retreated.

Once Yang Kai's Divine Sense departed, Shan Qing Luo could not help but breathe a sigh of relief. Heaven knows how dangerous it was just now; if he had truly seen all her secrets, she would be completely exposed before him, which was the most private aspect of a person.

Not only that, if their Divine Senses were to intersect, it would be a huge problem.

Unlike physical contact, the merging of souls was even more penetrating, making one reluctant to part, a pleasure far beyond physical union. Once tasted, it would become an addiction, impossible to quit.

Shan Qing Luo was genuinely afraid that Yang Kai might have developed some lewd thoughts about merging souls with her. Fortunately, he was somewhat perceptive and did not go too far.

What was going on with him?

Although Shan Qing Luo had many questions in her heart, it was now her moment of breakthrough, so she naturally did not dare to be careless, suppressing her doubts and focusing on her cultivation.

Yang Kai was also operating the Dual Cultivation Technique, with streams of clear energy flowing from the white cocoon into his meridians, gradually becoming stronger.

As if peeling silk from a cocoon, the cocoon surrounding Shan Qing Luo's body gradually shrank, revealing her voluptuous figure bit by bit.
