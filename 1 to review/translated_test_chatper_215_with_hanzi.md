## Chapter 215 — Cooperation (Second Update)

“Now you understand why I said there’s no need for reason or excuse to kill in that place, right? The blood beads you obtain after killing are the best justification! There, a single life is merely a stepping stone to power. Especially with your current strength at 離合境三层, you’ll be even more likely to be targeted.” **Ling Taixu** spoke in a deep voice.

Yang Kai’s face showed shock, but more than that, excitement and joy.

**Ling Taixu** could see through him like glass. Noticing his expression, he sighed inwardly, thinking: this boy really does intend to prove his Dao through slaughter.

Any other martial artist at 離合境三层 would have been terrified upon hearing this, but Yang Kai’s face was full of eagerness, as if he couldn’t wait to rush to that place and immerse himself in endless bloodshed.

There, he didn’t need to worry about harming the innocent. Even if he didn’t take the initiative to kill, others would come to kill him. Moreover, many of the martial artists there were wicked, deserving death.

Along the way, **Ling Taixu** explained much about that place. After all, he had once tempered himself inside it many years ago and had firsthand experience. That experience was invaluable.

Yang Kai listened intently, not daring to miss a word.

According to **Ling Taixu**, the place was located within **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**, yet didn’t truly belong to **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**. It was a strange space, and its entrance lay hidden in a lake deep within **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**.

No one knew what kind of mysterious energy or natural laws existed inside, but any living being that died there — whether human or demon beast — would have their energy and life essence condensed into a blood bead. These blood beads could be consumed directly or taken out and given to others. They were extremely valuable. The stronger the being that died, the more potent and valuable the blood bead.

Moreover, all offensive and defensive artifacts lost their effect inside that place, likely sealed by some invisible force. Upon hearing this, Yang Kai’s heart sank.

With his current strength at 離合境三层, who knew how many **True Essence Realm** experts might enter? If he encountered one without his **Shura Sword** or 千蕊**Blood Sea Begonia** to assist him, he would surely fall into a disadvantage — possibly even die.

But then he thought: everyone else would be similarly restricted. That notion comforted him.

That strange realm opened only once every ten years. Yang Kai had only just returned to **Lingxiao Pavilion** in time to catch this opportunity. Had he come a few months later, he would have missed it.

Finally, **Ling Taixu** solemnly handed Yang Kai a small pouch.

The pouch was about the size of a palm, inscribed with intricate patterns and made of a strange material. It looked quite exquisite.

“What is this?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

“I call it 乾坤袋. Though small, it holds a great deal — an entire domain's worth of space,” **Ling Taixu** explained.

Yang Kai was visibly moved. He glanced at **Ling Taixu** with astonishment. He hadn't expected even this legendary treasure — said to be able to store items — to be in his hands.

“It was passed down by our ancestors. There’s probably only one in all of 大汉. Not even the Eight Great Families of **Zhongdu** possess something like it,” **Ling Taixu** said lightly.

Well, perhaps **Meng Wuya** had one too, but that old man hid all his treasures and refused to share them with anyone except his own disciples. Truly petty.

“There are some pills inside for you. Use them sparingly,” **Ling Taixu** instructed.

“En, thank you, Master!” Yang Kai carefully placed the pouch against his chest.

This thing was truly an unparalleled treasure. Treasures that could store items had only ever been rumored; few had actually seen them.

However, Yang Kai had the **Wordless Black Book** made from **Soul-Calming Stone** in his body, which could also refine storage treasures — and ones far superior to this 乾坤袋.

But Yang Kai sat atop a treasure mountain without knowing how to use it. A true tragedy.

After flying for nearly a day, a vast and eerie mountain range appeared before them.

**Ghostly Underworld Mountain**! The only forbidden land in all of 大汉! Desolate and ancient, it radiated a terrifying aura — like a colossal dragon lying dormant since time immemorial. It sent chills down one’s spine.

Just as they reached the mountain’s front, before entering, two groups appeared from the left and right.

The group from the left had six people — all women. An old crone and a beautiful matron led them, followed by four young girls.

The four girls wore tiny bells on their wrists and ankles. As they ran, the bells jingled with a crisp, pleasant sound like mountain springs — refreshing and clear.

This group of women were all quite beautiful. The matron exuded mature elegance: full-figured, graceful, with jet-black hair coiled into a bun, revealing a fair and slender neck. Her gaze carried the allure of autumn waves, mesmerizing and soul-stealing — eyes that seemed to speak. They made the sky bluer and the flowers more fragrant.

The four girls were all striking in their own ways — in their prime youth, graceful and dainty. Their snow-white skin gleamed, their delicate feet and slender toes carrying their own aesthetic charm. Some looked shy, others radiant, cold, or fiery — each a different kind of allure. Together, they could drive any man mad.

Even the old crone, despite her aged face etched by time, must have been a beauty in her youth.

The group stopped thirty zhang in front of Yang Kai and **Ling Taixu**. The old crone glanced at them and gave a faint snort.

Anyone coming to **Ghostly Underworld Mountain** at this time clearly had the same goal.

The entrance to that strange space was limited — they were all competitors.

**Ling Taixu** smiled faintly at the crone and whispered to Yang Kai, “They’re from the first-class sect 万花宫. These young ladies are spirited — be careful not to fall for their tricks, or they’ll swallow you whole.”

Yang Kai was still sizing up the four girls with glowing eyes, but straightened his expression upon hearing this. “Master, don’t worry. I’ll be careful.”

A moment later, the group from the right arrived. Leading them was an old man about **Ling Taixu**’s age, followed by three young cultivators — male and female — all with impressive strength and eerie auras.

The two men were more brazen than Yang Kai, their eyes practically glued to the 万花宫 disciples, irritating the girl beside them, who snorted coldly.

“They’re from **Ghost King Valley**,” **Ling Taixu** said grimly. “This could be trouble.”

“Why?” Yang Kai asked.

“Because back in the day, your Master and that old man fought many times. **Ghost King Valley** is an evil sect. Be especially wary of their hand techniques.”

Yang Kai looked closer and saw the three disciples’ hands were ghostly pale, devoid of blood — more like ghost claws than human hands.

The old man on the opposite side sneered. “**Ling Taixu**! You’re still alive?”

**Ling Taixu** snorted. “鬼厉, you haven’t died either!”

“Good, good,” 鬼厉 cackled. “I was worried I’d have no one to take revenge on. Heaven must be smiling on me today.”

“What? Still sore about the beating I gave you fifty years ago? You want to throw your life away again?” **Ling Taixu** replied coldly, unafraid.

鬼厉’s eyes burned with malice, yet he hesitated, seemingly wary of **Ling Taixu**.

The tension between them was so strong that even 鬼厉’s disciples glared daggers at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai returned their stare with a grin, unfazed.

*Thunk!* The crone from 万花宫 struck the ground with her dragon-headed cane.

“If the two of you aren’t planning to fight, why not discuss cooperating to enter **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**?” she suggested.

Though they had grudges, neither wanted to start a battle now — not while leading juniors here to temper themselves. The crone could tell both sides wanted a way out, so she offered one.

鬼厉 laughed. “For 宫主’s sake, I’ll let it slide today. But once this is over, **Ling Taixu**, you and I will settle this!”

“I’ll be waiting,” **Ling Taixu** answered coolly.

鬼厉 glanced darkly at Yang Kai, then ordered his disciples: “Remember that boy’s face. Once inside, kill him!”

“Yes!” the three responded coldly.

Yang Kai’s gaze darkened. He memorized their appearances in turn.

Thanks to the crone’s mediation, tensions eased. The three sides quickly arranged their formation. The crone led, the four girls followed, 鬼厉 took the middle with his disciples, and Yang Kai and **Ling Taixu** brought up the rear.

The matron from earlier also took a middle position, opposite 鬼厉.

With these four **Divine Roaming Realm** experts watching over the group, the young ones were well protected — assuming, of course, that no treachery occurred between **Ling Taixu** and 鬼厉.

**Ling Taixu** wouldn’t stoop to that level, but 鬼厉 was less trustworthy. That’s why the crone placed **Ling Taixu** in the rear — to guard against ambushes.

Thankfully, 鬼厉 behaved. The group moved steadily through **Ghostly Underworld Mountain**.

The reputation of **Ghostly Underworld Mountain** was not unwarranted. Everyone stayed alert, even in the outer perimeter, where powerful fifth- or sixth-tier demon beasts might appear.

The women from 万花宫 had some trick — the bells on their wrists and ankles made no sound now. The whole party moved in silence.
