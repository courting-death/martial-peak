## Chapter 247 â€” A Humble Display

At this thought, Yao He said to Yao Xi, "Xi'er, you use the Blood Bead first."

Yao Xi's face was filled with emotion and tenderness as she nodded slightly, then lifted her pretty face to look towards the martial artist of the Great Han, commanding imperiously, "Gather the Blood Beads for me!"

Seventeen or eighteen people exchanged glances, but no one was willing to move.

During this period, they had suffered a lot under Yao He and Yao Xi, wishing they could grind their bones to dust. Why would they want to help them?

However, ignoring the order wasn't an option either. If they angered them, it would only lead to more torment and disaster.

Ye Han from Wan Hua Palace stood up angrily, her little tiger teeth gleaming as she ground them, saying through clenched teeth, "I'll go!"

Yang Kai's eyes flickered, and he reached out to pull her back. "I'll go. You take a rest."

Bi Xiuming, who had been meditating, suddenly opened his eyes and chuckled, "What? Just got subdued and already want to show your loyalty? Even fighting for this kind of task?"

"Indeed. Under the eaves, one has no choice but to lower their head," Yang Kai replied with a smile, standing up.

Bi Xiuming and his Junior Brother sneered, their faces full of disdain, causing many others to show displeasure.

Walking around the places where the Demonic Beasts had died, Yang Kai collected thirty to forty Blood Beads, then strode over to the three from Senluo Palace.

Yao Xi looked at Yang Kai coldly, her face showing some wariness.

After all, Yang Kai was brought by Zi Mo, and Yao Xi had to be cautious.

"Toss the Blood Beads over!" When Yang Kai was about three zhang away, Yao Xi spoke coldly, not allowing him to come any closer.

Yang Kai nodded, using a clever force to continuously throw the thirty-plus Blood Beads over. Yao Xi caught them all without missing a single one.

Zi Mo watched coldly, and only after Yao Xi had collected all the Blood Beads did she speak, "Now that you have what you wanted, if you have nothing else, I will take my leave."

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged glances and chuckled, "Senior Sister, where do you intend to go?"

Zi Mo's expression changed, and she said in a deep voice, "Where I go is none of your concern!"

Yao Xi giggled, "Senior Sister's temper is still so fierce. We're just thinking of you. In this foreign land, dangers abound. Without Demonic Beasts to protect you, if something were to happen, how would we explain it to our Master?"

Zi Mo looked at them incredulously, "You even want to control me?"

Yao He said, "What are you saying, Senior Sister? We are family, and we should take care of each other."

Yao Xi nodded, "Yes, for Senior Sister's safety, I think it's best if you stay."

A cold smile appeared on Zi Mo's lips, her face filled with sorrow. On the way here, Yang Kai had already told her that Yao He and Yao Xi might go all the way and leave no room for retreat.

If they dared to touch your Demonic Beasts, they would dare to touch you! That's what Yang Kai had told her.

Zi Mo had held onto a sliver of hope, but now it seemed Yang Kai was absolutely right.

In a place like this, killing Zi Mo and covering it up well would leave no trace. As for the martial artists from the Great Han, they were all to be silenced. Why would Yao He and Yao Xi fear them?

First, they cut off her Demonic Beasts, then targeted her directly. Everything was exactly as Yang Kai had predicted. Whether to say he had foresight or an understanding of the deceitful human heart was hard to tell.

Zi Mo fell silent, her gaze gradually turning icy.

Yao Xi suddenly frowned, turning to Yang Kai and scolding unceremoniously, "What are you standing there for? Hurry back!"

After speaking, she looked at Zi Mo with contempt, "Senior Sister, is this how you teach your subordinates? No manners at all."

Zi Mo did not reply, but Yang Kai gave an awkward smile, cautiously cupping his fists towards her. He glanced at Zi Mo, his expression turning venomous as he spoke, "Could you two make this wench remove the insect from my body? I am willing to abandon darkness for light and pledge my loyalty to you."

Zi Mo turned sharply to look at Yang Kai, gritting her teeth, "What did you just call me?"

"Wench! What's the matter?" Yang Kai seemed to have found a backer, straightening his back and confronting her.

"Heh..." Zi Mo laughed in anger, "Dare to call me that, it seems you've forgotten who's in charge."

These were the words Yang Kai had once said to her, now returned in kind.

"The previous lesson wasn't enough!" Zi Mo's killing intent surged as she shouted. Yang Kai immediately fell to the ground in agony, clutching his stomach and rolling, crying out to Yao He and Yao Xi, "Save me, I truly wish to serve you, willing to sacrifice everything!"

This commotion naturally drew the attention of the martial artists from the Great Han.

Hearing Yang Kai's shameless words, anyone who had some acquaintance with him couldn't help but show a pained expression, especially the four maidens from Wan Hua Palace. Han Xiao Qi frowned, evidently not expecting Yang Kai to be so spineless.

In contrast, Bi Xiuming and his Junior Brother were stunned for a moment before bursting into laughter, "What did he say? He wants to pledge loyalty to those two? Hahaha... It's killing me, he really was trying to show loyalty by taking on that task. I said he was diligent for a reason, and it turns out I was right!"

Saying this, he spat on the ground with disdain.

Shame, utter shame! Although these martial artists from the Great Han were also under control, none had ever begged so pathetically like Yang Kai.

Yang Kai continued to cry out in agony, seemingly unaware of how disgraceful he was, "Save me, for the sake of my willingness to defect, save me!"

Yao He and Yao Xi clearly hadn't expected to witness such a spectacle.

Zi Mo was their target, and Yang Kai was a martial artist brought by Zi Mo, yet now, the two were at odds.

Wonderful, simply wonderful!

Not to save Yang Kai's life, but to strike at Zi Mo's arrogance, Yao He and Yao Xi felt they couldn't just watch any longer. If they did, this spineless martial artist from the Great Han would become useless.

"Senior Sister, please stop." Yao Xi said with a smug expression, barely suppressing her laughter.

Zi Mo looked up, her eyes cold, "What? You want to interfere with how I discipline my subordinates?"

Yao He said, "If it were anyone else, we wouldn't interfere, but you heard him, Senior Sister. He wants to pledge loyalty to us, so now he's ours. Surely, Senior Sister understands."

The two exchanged glances, and Zi Mo took a deep breath, biting her lip before saying, "Fine, since Junior Brother and Junior Sister want him, as Senior Sister, I must oblige!"

Yao He smiled, as if he had won a great victory, his face full of satisfaction.

Yang Kai, who had been rolling on the ground, finally stopped screaming and struggling. His clothes were soaked with sweat as he staggered to his feet, cupping his fists towards Yao He and Yao Xi in gratitude, "Thank you both. I've suffered a lot under this wench."

Yao He looked at him meaningfully and nodded, "Yes, Senior Sister's temper is bad, but you've made the right choice. Follow us, and you won't suffer!"

"Thank you both, thank you both!" Yang Kai became even more obsequious.

On the side of the Great Han martial artists, Bi Xiuming sneered, "A fence-sitter, doesn't he know that no matter whose hands he falls into, it's just a matter of time before he dies?"

Yang Kai straightened his back again, glaring at Zi Mo with a sinister smile, "Wench, remove the insect from my body, or you'll regret it!"

A classic case of a fox borrowing the tiger's might!

Yao He and Yao Xi grew even more smug.

They no longer needed to confront Zi Mo directly. Yang Kai's betrayal alone was enough to disgrace her.

"Fine, fine!" Zi Mo was heartbroken, seemingly enraged beyond measure, "Since you wish it, then so be it! But do you think falling into their hands will end well for you? Sooner or later, you'll die. I hope you won't regret it then!"

Yang Kai arrogantly pointed his nose to the sky, "Mind your own business, wench. I'm happy, what can you do about it?"

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged glances, thinking this martial artist from the Great Han was a fool and an idiot. But if he weren't, he wouldn't have been foolish enough to confront Zi Mo directly.

The Yao siblings were pleased, while the group of martial artists from the Great Han wished they could bury their heads in the ground. Although their relationship with Yang Kai wasn't deep, they felt embarrassed. They were all from the Great Han, and now they were making a scene in front of the Tianlang people, losing face!

Yet the person involved seemed completely unaware.

Only Leng Shan inadvertently coughed lightly, covering her mouth as a smile of amusement flashed in her eyes.

She truly admired Zi Mo and the others' acting skills.

And she was even more impressed by Yang Kai's prior planning and strategy, now unfolding almost exactly as he had predicted.

Leng Shan knew that once this hurdle was overcome, the real show would begin. She quietly moved to Han Xiao Qi from Wan Hua Palace, whispering something in her ear.

Han Xiao Qi's eyes flashed with surprise as she looked at Leng Shan, who nodded seriously with a solemn expression.

"I understand." Han Xiao Qi took a deep breath, a faint smile appearing on her lips, and she passed on what she had heard to her three Junior Sisters.

"Hurry up, what's taking so long?" Yang Kai urged, as if eager to pledge allegiance to Yao He and Yao Xi.

Zi Mo gave him a deep look before stepping forward, placing a hand on Yang Kai's abdomen.

Yang Kai blinked, looking at Yao He, "You two, she won't take the chance to kill me, will she?"

Yao He sneered, "Senior Sister isn't that kind of person."

"That's good, that's good." Yang Kai sighed in relief, and moments later, his face turned grim as he coughed up a Control Soul Insect.

Before Zi Mo could retrieve the insect, he rushed forward and stomped on it, cursing viciously and crudely, spittle flying everywhere.

Yao He and Yao Xi's brows twitched at his words, while Zi Mo's face turned ashen, her body trembling with rage, her eyes filled with killing intent as she looked at Yang Kai.

"Enough!" Even Yao He couldn't stand Yang Kai's foolishness any longer, quickly shouting, "The Control Soul Insect has a unique constitution; you can't kill it by stomping."

"Oh, a humble display!"

Everyone felt dizzy. Should they say he was self-aware or something else?
