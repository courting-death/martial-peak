## Chapter 3 – The Man with 147 Consecutive Losses

Inner duels at Lingxiao Pavilion took lives every year, yet Zhou Dingjun still felt a ripple of awe as he watched the senior brother before him charge on, unflinching.

Had their positions been reversed, Zhou admitted to himself he would have conceded once he saw he could not win.

“Leave the green hills standing and you need not fear running out of firewood”—such is worldly wisdom. “Break through the southern wall and never turn back”—that is resolve.

Seeing Yang Kai’s battered form and the battle spirit blazing ever fiercer in his eyes, Zhou knew that unless he knocked him unconscious, today would never end.

With that thought, Zhou chopped his hand like a blade across Yang Kai’s neck. The fierce momentum around Yang Kai vanished; his eyes glazed, and his body crumpled limply to the ground.

A dozen meters away, atop the crown of a tall tree, a slender figure flipped open a small ledger. She penned a line:

> Trial Disciple Yang Kai versus Outer Disciple Zhou Dingjun—victory: Zhou Dingjun.

The veiled figure was clearly a young woman. The leaf-shaped armband on her sleeve revealed her identity: a Shadow Hall Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Shadow Hall, overseen by the Pavilion’s Third Elder, maintained detailed records of sect affairs—duel results foremost among them. Thus challengers never worried that their victories might be overlooked; hidden Shadow Hall disciples recorded every bout and submitted monthly tallies.

After noting the outcome, the woman produced an even smaller booklet and read the latest entry:

> Jihe Calendar, Fourteenth Year, Fifth Month, Seventh Day — Yang Kai, duel 147: Defeat.

Apart from that fresh line, the pages were packed with similar records: date, duel number—result: one word—Defeat.

One hundred forty-seven straight losses, not a single win since the Pavilion’s founding—an achievement to startle ghosts and gods alike. Its creator now lay motionless on the ground.

Yang Kai had never challenged anyone; all 147 fights were forced upon him. Being challenged every five days had continued for over two years.

Watching him below, Xia Ningchang—the Shadow Hall girl—frowned slightly. She could not fathom such stubbornness. Demoted to Trial Disciple, unable even to feed himself, why did he stay? If he left, life would surely improve. What obsession let this thin youth endure 147 defeats without despair?

Perhaps it was a fool’s pride? She had first noticed Yang Kai by chance; her assignment covered this region, and she had witnessed every challenge, every time he was knocked out. After countless bouts, she had begun paying attention to this Body Tempering Third Stage youth.

She wondered how long his resolve would last. With his aptitude and speed of progress, the wider world of ordinary folk seemed more fitting than the Jianghu.

Below, the crowd dispersed; only Yang Kai lay unconscious as time flowed.  
Xia Ningchang’s figure flickered and vanished from the treetop.

Yang Kai awoke again when sun already climbed high. Pain burned everywhere. Staggering up, he saw he was no longer where he had collapsed but beneath the shade of a nearby tree.

Strange—had some kind-hearted senior carried him here? Such kindness had never happened before. Frowning, he remembered a hazy figure drifting before his eyes while he was unconscious, but the memory was too vague.

A clear drag mark stretched from his original spot to where he now stood—proof that someone had hauled him across the ground. Feeling his back, he winced at the raw sting.

Yang Kai froze, then burst into anger. Whatever gratitude he might have felt vanished. Whoever “helped” him had plainly dragged him like a sack of grain—so his back was rubbed raw. Better they had left him!

Still fuming, he noticed he was clutching something. He looked—an exquisitely crafted porcelain bottle.

What was this? It certainly wasn’t his; he owned only his clothes and his broom.

A label bore three characters. Yang Kai read aloud: “Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment.”

He knew the salve. Common wound medicine in Lingxiao Pavilion, not a miracle drug but highly effective. Most disciples carried a bottle. Even so, at the Logistics Hall each cost ten Contribution Points.

Ten points—a full month of sweeping.

Who had left it? A surge of emotion welled up; even the pain in his back eased. Three years in Lingxiao Pavilion had shown him endless coldness, yet today someone had left this bottle for him. The act pierced deep.

So not all Pavilion disciples were heartless.

To that person, such a bottle was nothing; to Yang Kai, it was exactly what he needed.

“As they say, a drop of grace—repay with a spring,” he murmured, trying to recall the shadowy figure—yet it grew fuzzier. Only a faint fragrance lingered at his nose.

“This medicine is scented?” He had learned something new.

Settling his mood, he tidied his robe, tucked the precious bottle into his shirt, lifted his broom, and resumed sweeping.

Inside and out he worked until noon before finishing the day’s labor. Exhausted and hungry, he returned to his hut.

His morning injuries still untreated. Though starving, he endured and tended wounds first.

Stripping off his blue robe, he fetched a basin of clear water. Anyone watching would have been shocked.

His frame was frail, ribs visible, scarcely any flesh. Yet this malnourished body was mottled with bruises and scars—hardly a patch of unbroken skin.

Challenged every five days, always defeated, always knocked out—old wounds yet unhealed, new ones layered on. Most would have collapsed from such pain, but Yang Kai endured. Not only endured—he still trained daily and swept, never letting wounds slow him.
