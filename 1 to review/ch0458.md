## Chapter 458 — Liu Qingyao

Gazing at the two figures retreating, Liu Qingyao frowned slightly, a disdainful look crossing her face as she slowly shook her head. “Relying on outside help is not true skill.”

Though she spoke thus, her speed suddenly surged, clearly unwilling to fall behind.

The fifty-mile distance was not far. Within less than the time it took for a half-incense stick to burn, all three had successively arrived at the banks of Po Jing Lake.

Yang Kai landed on the east side, Yang Zhao on the west, while Liu Qingyao brazenly took the position in the middle.

Only now did Yang Kai have the chance to carefully scrutinize this reputed First Young Master of Zhongdu.

Clad in a plain green robe, neither ostentatious nor vulgar, he seemed no more than twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. His physique was sword-like, not overly burly, yet his body exuded an undeniable power. His expression was indifferent, as if unconcerned with the world, but his eyes revealed an arrogant霸气[Primordial Qi].

This sort of arrogance was not a pose but the natural demeanor of a long-time top-tier expert, as if he stood above on the clouds, gazing down on all living beings.

He was not a pushover! Just a slight sensing made Yang Kai understand this.

Though his Realm was only Divine Roaming Realm, Third Stage, it was certainly not comparable to an ordinary Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage martial artist. His true power could only be known through combat.

Recalling the boast this man had made earlier, Yang Kai smiled faintly. This subtle gesture caught Liu Qingyao’s attention; her otherwise somewhat listless but brilliant eyes immediately locked onto Yang Kai, her Divine Sense boldly sweeping over him.

Yang Kai’s eyebrows furrowed. His expression turned slightly displeased.

Though her action posed no real threat and was not malicious, boldly prying into someone else's Divine Sense was an unspoken taboo.

Such behavior could easily spark unnecessary disputes or battles. Most would not dare to act so blatantly; Liu Qingyao’s audacity came simply because she did not care much for Yang Kai.

Sure enough, after scanning, Liu Qingyao no longer paid attention to him, standing silently and alone, extremely conspicuous.

No one knew why he had come this time.

At the shore of Po Jing Lake, a group had already arrived early. They were Yang Wei’s men. Upon seeing Yang Kai and Yang Zhao, they only nodded lightly. When their gaze shifted to Liu Qingyao, their eyes suddenly hardened, as their True Essence fluctuated slightly.

Rumors said that after Yang Wei returned to Zhongdu, he had once battled with Liu Qingyao. However, the outcome of that fight remained unknown to anyone.

Now that both sides met again, sparks were bound to fly.

“You’ve reached Divine Roaming Realm Second Stage; the eldest young master’s cultivation is progressing swiftly,” unexpectedly, Liu Qingyao initiated greetings with Yang Wei.

“Thanks to Lord Liu,” Yang Wei replied calmly, “that battle gave me much insight.”

Liu Qingyao nodded lightly, her voice calm and even. “If you wish to gain further insight, I await at any time.”

Yang Kai and Yang Zhao’s faces twisted oddly. They exchanged glances across the distance, understanding the deeper meanings in those few words.

Their brief exchange was full of implications.

It seemed the rumors were true—Yang Wei had lost to Liu Qingyao in that battle, likely defeated badly. Otherwise, why else would Liu Qingyao speak so arrogantly?

Yet Liu Qingyao’s arrogance did not anger Yang Wei. His face remained unchanged as he nodded and said, “I will come. I hope Lord Liu will not be too surprised then.”

Liu Qingyao slowly shook her head. “I won’t be surprised, because you are no match for me.”

These words instantly enflamed the allies behind Yang Wei, their faces dark and full of anger as they glared at Liu Qingyao.

To belittle their leader’s status before them, Yang Wei’s allies could hardly remain indifferent.

Still, Yang Wei did not lose his composure; he raised a hand to calm the restless crowd and said loudly, “Just because I am not a match for you now doesn’t mean it will always be so. Even if in the future I am not your match, that does not mean there is no one in the Yang Family who can match you. Lord Liu, I am not the strongest among the younger generation of the Yang Family, but I know you are the strongest in the Liu Family. The limit of the Liu Family lies with you, but the Yang Family’s limit remains unknown.”

Liu Qingyao’s expression finally shifted, a spark of interest flashing across her face. “Is there someone stronger than you among the Yang Family’s younger generation?”

She paused, then suddenly cast her gaze toward Yang Zhao. “Is it the Second Young Master?”

“Hey, hey…” Yang Zhao forced a bitter smile. “Lord Liu jokes. Compared to the eldest brother, I’m no match. You two talk among yourselves, don’t drag me into this.”

Liu Qingyao let out a light laugh. “If not the Second Young Master, then who else could it be? Among the Yang Family’s direct descendants, only your eldest and second young masters are somewhat strong. The others…”

She slowly shook her head and, while speaking, glanced briefly at Yang Kai, showing no particular interest.

The usually meticulous and aloof Yang Wei suddenly burst out laughing. “Lord Liu, if you cannot see it, then it proves you really are not his match.”

Liu Qingyao’s expression darkened as she looked toward Yang Wei at a distance, not understanding why he spoke so confidently. But after pondering, she had no idea who in the Yang Family could surpass her.

If there really were such a person and she had failed to discern it, then that was truly a terrifying individual!

Someone who could deceive her eyes was already a step ahead.

“Eldest Young Master, I hope your words are true,” Liu Qingyao said solemnly.

“You shall see for yourself,” Yang Wei replied with a faint nod.

Yang Kai had been observing coldly throughout, not interjecting, but he felt Yang Wei’s gaze flickering toward him repeatedly.

Had his eldest brother noticed something? Yang Kai wondered secretly.

After a while, Huo Xingchen arrived with a large contingent, and Yang Zhao’s men gathered around him as well.

When these reinforcements appeared, Yang Zhao visibly relaxed, lowering his guard. Earlier, he had clearly been worried that Yang Wei would take advantage of his solitude.

Though a Blood Servant protected him, it was still dangerous to come alone so recklessly.

By mid-morning, more and more people gathered at the shore of Po Jing Lake. Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying each led their men to the scene in succession.

After so much time of preparation and recruitment, the support each of the six brothers now held was evident at a glance.

The first three who arrived brought roughly equal strength; although some differences existed, they were not significant. The latter three, however, were evidently weaker. Even though each had an ally disciple from the Eight Great Families, their personal charisma and networks were insufficient to rally much support.

Noticing this, their expressions soured.

Because even Yang Kai, once thought unlikely to survive the first night, had now pulled ahead of them.

If this continued, the situation would only worsen.

The three all silently resolved to step up efforts in rallying support once they returned, determined not to let Yang Kai outpace them.

Not only were the Yang family’s six brothers gathered by Po Jing Lake, but the martial artists from War City who had come to watch had also encircled the lake.

However, these spectators maintained a safe three-mile distance, observing silently.

No one would risk their life foolishly. With so many powerful experts gathered, getting caught in the conflict could mean death without even understanding how.

Earlier in the inn’s main hall, a pair of sisters had also joined the crowd, gazing distantly toward where Yang Kai stood.

After not seeing him for months, the man had clearly grown much stronger, perhaps due in part to his changed status. He now displayed a charm and aggressiveness greater than before.

One sister’s eyes glowed strangely, a coquettish expression blooming as she looked toward that direction. This mood soon affected the other sister, causing her heart to race.

Biting her lip lightly and inhaling deeply, her bosom heaved with anxiety, she smiled ruefully.

It was truly torment. Since cultivating that divine skill, the sisters’ feelings had gradually connected. Due to the younger sister’s preferences, the elder sister had become influenced.

From time to time, she would recall that man’s figure, but was too embarrassed to show it before her sister, suffering deeply in silence.

This time, they had already arrived at War City long ago, yet she still lacked the courage or face to meet him, staying concealed in an inn a mile outside his manor, often looking out the window, hoping to see him leave. But no sign of him appeared.

Today, finally seeing him, she still hesitated, almost missing the opportunity.

Reflecting on her hypocrisy, she hated herself. Unlike her sister, who wore her feelings openly, she was forced to hide hers.

“Hey, aren’t you going to help him?” asked a man from before, chuckling.

“Help with what? There are only three of us here. In such a large gathering, what can we do?”

“Tch, that’s why it’s said women and scoundrels are hard to please! I shouldn’t have come with you! I should have brought everyone from the inn out. Now it’s just three of us, all at the True Essence Realm. We’re no use.”

Time passed slowly as everyone secretly awaited the arrival of the secret treasures, all speculating how the Yang Family would deploy the thousand treasures here.

Yang Kai also observed quietly, his powerful Divine Sense surpassing all, constantly scanning the surroundings.

Among the onlookers, many hidden experts lurked! Realizing this, Yang Kai was alarmed. These masters were not mere spectators but were likely the powerful ones from the Eight Great Families, observing the situation closely.

Beneath the waters of Po Jing Lake, subtle energy fluctuations emerged. Even Yang Kai struggled to detect these faint disturbances; others would be even less likely.

It seemed some treasures had been secretly placed at the lake bottom long ago, waiting for the appointed time to surface.
