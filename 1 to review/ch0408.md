## Chapter 408 — My Bargaining Chip

Using True Essence to carve traces in some jade, in order to convey messages that are inconvenient to express in words, is not a particularly impressive technique; it merely requires strict control over True Essence.

Therefore, when Yang Zhen saw Yang Kai take out two pieces of jade, he understood there must be something noteworthy inside.

With Divine Sense probing into the jade, he carefully examined it.

Suddenly, Yang Zhen frowned, his expression turning serious. After a moment, confusion filled his eyes, which then transformed into astonishment and shock.

As his gaze changed, the expressions on Yang Zhen's face became increasingly fascinating.

The old men who had originally prepared to watch a show were momentarily stunned upon seeing Yang Zhen's expression, guessing among themselves whether he had discovered something extraordinary.

After a while, Yang Zhen took a deep breath, slowly withdrawing his Divine Sense from the jade, looking oddly at Yang Kai, his expression grave as he picked up the other piece of jade.

Continuing to inspect it as before, like a replay of events, the various changes on Yang Zhen's face were acted out once more.

This time, the several white-haired elders in the hall could no longer sit still. One by one, they stood up quietly and gathered together, unsure of when they had begun moving closer.

Moments later, Yang Kai was pushed out to the outermost edge, while the old fellows huddled together, all waiting for Yang Zhen to retract his Divine Sense.

“What exactly is inside?” One elder, unable to contain his curiosity, asked. He had no idea what Yang Kai had brought that could warrant such importance from Yang Zhen. As he spoke, he reached out to take the piece of jade on the table.

Before it could be grasped, Yang Zhen snatched it back, causing the other to glare at him.

“That kid, come here!” Yang Zhen waved his hand, rudely pushing aside the curious elders.

“Disciple is here.” Yang Kai stepped forward. Technically, Yang Zhen should be considered of his grandfather's generation, but in the Yang Family, relationships are generally not labeled by kinship unless the relationship is particularly close.

With both pieces of jade in hand, Yang Zhen frowned, his old face slightly reddening, he asked in a muffled voice, “What are these things?”

“Since you don’t know what they are, why are you so expressive?” An elder with white hair said in astonishment, while others shook their heads, their expectations greatly diminished.

“Two sets of spirit formations.”

“Nonsense.” Yang Zhen scolded lightly, “I’m not an idiot. Of course I know they are two sets of spirit formations. What I am asking is what kind of spirit formations they are meant to be used for.”

As he spoke, his face turned even redder.

At his age, with a wealth of experience, he actually couldn’t identify something brought back by a young descendant, naturally feeling a bit embarrassed.

Yang Kai pinched his nose, “Spirit formations for alchemy!”

Yang Zhen was immediately taken aback, “Used for alchemy?”

He shook his head repeatedly, saying, “I have seen many spirit formations used for alchemy, but I have never seen any as complex and intricate as the ones you brought. Just engraving such spirit formations onto a dan furnace is a considerable hassle, and if it’s used for alchemy, it will certainly exhaust the alchemist's energy and True Essence even more. Are you sure these two sets of spirit formations are effective?”

“Absolutely!”

“Tell me, what exactly are their uses?” Yang Zhen frowned and asked. He wasn’t very knowledgeable about alchemy and naturally couldn’t see the wonders and mysteries contained in the spirit formations. He simply felt that these two sets of spirit formations were overly complex, and while they must be good things, they surely had drawbacks.

“One set can increase the success rate of alchemy.” Yang Kai said flatly, “In other words, if an alchemist's usual success rate is only sixty percent, by using this set of spirit formations, it can reach ninety percent!”

Yang Zhen couldn’t help but be moved.

Ninety percent! Even if he didn’t understand alchemy, he knew what an alchemist capable of ensuring a ninety percent success rate would be like. An ordinary alchemist typically could only guarantee a sixty or seventy percent success rate; from ten sets of alchemy materials, they’d probably only produce six or seven dan pills.

A good alchemist might reach around eighty percent, especially those disciples from Yao Wang Valley, most of whom are at this level. Now, having a spirit formation that could increase the success rate by thirty percent meant that even a slightly competent alchemist could ensure that dan pills were successfully produced every time using this spirit formation!

Over the years, how many materials could this save? And how much time and effort?

In an instant, Yang Zhen realized the preciousness of this spirit formation.

Of course, this was all based on whether what Yang Kai said was true.

“What about the other set?” Yang Zhen pressed down his astonishment and asked, forcing his tone to remain calm.

“It has a chance to enhance the quality of dan pills!” Yang Kai replied nonchalantly.

“What do you mean?” Yang Zhen instinctively furrowed his brow, hastily pressing for more. He held his breath, as if his understanding was correct, then this spirit formation’s value far exceeded the previous one!

“Originally, crafting a batch of mid-grade Heaven-Grade dan, by using this spirit formation, there is a chance to produce high-grade Heaven-Grade dan.” Yang Kai patiently explained and added, “This chance isn’t very large, but it will definitely appear!”

The elders’ breathing became noticeably quicker. They realized the value of this spirit formation.

One of them, slightly nervously, asked, “Then what about crafting a batch of upper-grade Mystery-Grade dan?”

Yang Kai shrugged and smiled, “There’s a good chance a Spirit-Grade dan will emerge.”

Spirit-Grade! Those two words sounded like war drums to the elders’ ears, shaking their eardrums and leaving them in disbelief as they gazed at Yang Kai, trying to detect any hint of humor on his face.

Yang Kai remained calm.

These two sets of spirit formations had been comprehended from the True Alchemy Formula, and it was evident they must have usefulness.

The Elder Hall fell silent, a group of old fellows stood rooted in place, unsure of what to do next, each pondering the value of the spirit formations and the truth behind Yang Kai’s words.

After a moment, Yang Zhen suddenly regained his posture, glaring grimly at Yang Kai, his voice cold, “Do you know what the consequences of fooling the Elder Hall are? Even though you are a direct descendant of the Yang Family, if you dare to speak such nonsense here, I can make you disappear without a grave!”

“Whether it’s a joke or not, let someone knowledgeable come verify it.” Yang Kai frowned.

“Not bad, you’ve got some guts!” Yang Zhen sneered, commanding, “Go summon Cheng Bailian from the dan chamber.”

“Oh.” One of the plump elders answered, his figure flickering and vanishing.

Cheng Bailian, the chief alchemist of the Yang Family! His skills in alchemy were renowned throughout the world, though he was somewhat inferior to Xiao Fusheng.

Xiao Fusheng was a high-grade Mystery-Grade alchemist, the only one in the entire Great Han Dynasty. Cheng Bailian was merely a mid-grade Mystery-Grade alchemist.

Although it was just one tier difference, that gap was like a chasm between Cheng Bailian and Xiao Fusheng, leaving him capable only of looking up at the master’s back.

“You still have time to regret. Wait until Cheng Bailian arrives, and if you change your words then, I won’t tolerate it.” Yang Zhen said grimly, testing him one last time.

Yang Kai frowned, his expression displeased, “Elder, I present these two sets of spirit formations to obtain two Blood Servants to follow me; moreover, I wish to give these things to the Yang Family to bring benefits. After all, this is the place where I was born. If I only wanted to exchange for two Blood Servants, one set of these spirit formations would suffice. Why would I bring two? Regarding the truth, I believe Elder can discern it.”

Yang Zhen's expression froze, considering carefully, he felt Yang Kai made sense, his face slightly softened as he nodded, “You are right. Perhaps I was too cautious, but as for the truth, let us await verification. The truth cannot hide, and any deception will be revealed, hehe!”

Saying this, he frowned again, carefully inspecting the two sets of spirit formations in the jade, but no matter how he looked, he couldn’t discern too much.

An entire hour passed before the plump elder, who had hurried away, eventually brought back a man approximately in his fifties.

Entering the Elder Hall, this man wore a gloomy expression, seeming somewhat displeased.

As he stepped into the hall, before Yang Zhen could speak, Cheng Bailian shouted angrily, “Yang Zhen! What’s going on? I was in the middle of refining a batch of Xuanqing Dan, just about to open the furnace, and you call me over at this critical moment. If you don’t compensate me for that batch of dan, I’ll refuse to refine pills for the Yang Family for three months!”

“Compensate, compensate!” Yang Zhen's face turned dark, continuously nodding.

Despite his old age being addressed so rudely, and even shouted at angrily, Yang Zhen could not get angry. After all, this person was the chief alchemist of the Yang Family, and many high-quality dan pills had to be refined by him, so even with a significant gap in strength, Yang Zhen had to swallow his anger.

Alchemy masters are not to be trifled with, especially the skilled ones.

Cheng Bailian lightly snorted, saying, “That’s a batch of upper-grade Heaven-Grade dan. Although it cannot be considered very valuable, it has cost me a lot of effort. Since I view you favorably, five hundred thousand taels is fine.”

Yang Zhen's face grew much darker, and suppressing his frustration, he said gloomily, “Let’s not talk about that; let’s discuss serious matters first.”

Cheng Bailian nodded and then glanced at Yang Kai standing beside him, saying, “On the way here, I heard that it was this kid who brought back the two sets of spirit formations?”

“Correct, let’s see if they are truly useful.” Yang Zhen handed over the two pieces of jade.

Cheng Bailian casually took them, disdainfully smiling, “I’ve been refining pills for so many years and pride myself on my mastery in alchemy. I’ve also studied many spirit formations, yet I have never heard of such miraculous spirit formations existing in the world. I see you’re getting senile, being fooled and dragging me down with you. If this gets out, where will you put your old face?”

“Stop with the nonsense; take a look!” Yang Zhen was infuriated by Cheng Bailian’s repetitive remarks but found nowhere to vent his anger. His old face turned purple, secretly resolved that if Yang Kai really deceived him, he would not let it slide.

Only then did Cheng Bailian leisurelyfind a place to sit down, his expression casual as he released his Divine Sense to probe into the jade.

Everyone in the Elder Hall, except Yang Kai, attentively watched him, eager to know how he would evaluate these two sets of spirit formations.

Unexpectedly, just as Cheng Bailian sent his Divine Sense into the jade, he suddenly let out an odd cry, standing up abruptly with a face full of disbelief.

Everyone held their breath, anxiously waiting. His shout startled everyone.
