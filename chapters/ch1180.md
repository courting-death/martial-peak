## Chapter 1180 — The Earth Fissure's Arcane Mystery

"Wait a while, Young Master." Xie Yong smiled faintly. "He's been fighting for so long; even if there's a way to recover, he certainly won't be at his peak. If those Fire Spirit Beasts can finish him off, all the better. If he slaughters them all, he'll be utterly spent — then it's not too late for Xie Jun to move. By then he won't have any strength left to resist. For now, Young Master, hold your temper and enjoy watching his pitiful, dying struggle, isn't that perfect?"

"Hmm, well said!" Xie Hongwen beamed. He gaped and stared toward Yang Kai, just as Xie Yong had said, ready to enjoy watching how Yang Kai would thrash about in his death throes.

Xie Yong and Xie Jun exchanged a glance and both read the helpless mockery in each other's eyes; only a fool like Xie Hongwen could be toyed with so casually by them — try that with anyone else and it wouldn't be so simple to pull off.

The three of them quietly resumed their ambush. Yang Kai, surrounded by a ring of Fire Spirit Beasts, wore an expression as dark as night.

He hadn't noticed he was being tracked, and the trackers had likewise entered the valley and hidden beneath a nearby hill, waiting for the right moment to strike.

All his attention was fixed on those Fire Spirit Beasts; he had no mind for anything else.

He had been slaughtering them for nearly an entire day, yet had advanced less than ten li; to rely on killing his way out of the valley, Yang Kai estimated it would take at least half a month!

In half a month, the elites of the great Sects and noble clans would have already crossed the Heat-Flame Zone and reached the heaven-and-earth treasure area to gather Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine — by the time he arrived there would be nothing left for him.

He also understood that no amount of hurry would help; the strangeness of this valley exceeded his expectations.

The Fire Spirit Beasts came in an endless stream; killing them didn't exhaust them, and to make matters worse, none of them contained Crystal Stone.

Still, he had finally discerned some flaw in the Fire Spirit Beasts. Although they poured out of the earth's fissures from all directions, at root they seemed to be quietly emerging from the same direction.

That direction appeared to be the source from which the Fire Spirit Beasts were continually born.

Yang Kai let his Divine Sense spread that way. Normally, with his mastery of spatial forces, he could easily locate such a source. But inside the Flowing Flame Sandland his senses were severely suppressed; searching cost great effort.

Fortunately, after half a day's probing and observation, Yang Kai finally pinpointed the origin of the Fire Spirit Beasts.

It was, astonishingly, a huge earth fissure. Under the scrutiny of his Divine Sense, lines of serpent-like fire leapt out from that fissure, ran along the other branching clefts, and swiftly appeared around Yang Kai, then formed into individual Fire Spirit Beasts that launched themselves at him in endless waves.

Having found the target and its source, Yang Kai no longer bothered entangling with the maddening swarm. With a thought he recalled the eight mountain phantoms he'd summoned and hurled them forward like hammers, the Purple Shield guarding his back. Demonic Flame surged on his hands and coalesced into a long sword; wrapped in sword radiance, he forced his way toward the fissure.

The Fire Spirit Beasts were routed. Yang Kai's sudden strike, though without warning, had its share of success, but their numbers were too many. Some seventh- and eighth-tier Fire Spirit Beasts still bore down on him, tearing his robes to rags and even leaving shallow wounds on his body.

For reasons he couldn't understand, the moment they saw Yang Kai charging in that direction, all the Fire Spirit Beasts went berserk and fought with even greater ferocity. Seventh- and eighth-tier beasts threw themselves at him recklessly, determined to stop his advance.

Yang Kai poured out his strength. Eight mountain phantoms cleared the way ahead and the Purple Shield protected his rear, freeing him of worry. With Demonic Flame in hand he slashed out dark, awe-inspiring sword beams; the road-blockers were all cut down, his momentum     smashing through like splitting bamboo, crushing and sweeping everything aside.

At last he reached the great earth fissure and indeed saw the scene his Divine Sense had revealed before: from some point beneath the fissure pale fire, rich with Spiritual Qi, rose up and transformed into Fire Spirit Beasts which then barred the way.

Yang Kai flashed and dropped into the fissure itself, with tens of thousands of Fire Spirit Beasts close on his heels.

The three who had been secretly watching from a nearby hill — Xie Hongwen and the others — were stunned by the sight.

They didn't know why Yang Kai had suddenly leapt into a fissure, but now the valley had fallen eerily silent; the dense mass of Fire Spirit Beasts had vanished. Only from within that fissure came earth-shattering beast roars.

"What is he doing?" Xie Hongwen frowned.

"I don't know, but he'll come out eventually. If he doesn't, then he must be dead!" Xie Jun thought a moment, then pointed at a hill closer to the fissure. "Let's go ambush there. If he doesn't come out, forget it. If he does, we can strike him. From that position, even if he's at the Origin Returning Realm, he can't avoid my guaranteed killing blow!"

"Good!" Xie Hongwen saw Xie Jun's eagerness and had no reason to refuse. The three of them slipped away, covertly moving to lie in wait atop another hill.

Beneath that immense earth fissure Yang Kai fell a thousand zhang. His objective was clear: search downwards along the paths where the fire light came from. He was eager to learn what mystery this valley hid that could spawn so many Fire Spirit Beasts — and why those beasts lacked Crystal Stone!

He had already wasted a day here and expended colossal amounts of Saint Yuan; if he didn't haul something useful out of this place, it would be a bitter loss.

Whatever wondrous cause birthed the Fire Spirit Beasts here, it was surely rare to behold.

After falling for some time and slaying countless Fire Spirit Beasts along the way, Yang Kai's eyes suddenly brightened.

He realized he had finally reached the spot: below was a cave-like opening, and the serpent-like fire that formed into Fire Spirit Beasts was pouring out from that cave.

He stepped lightly onto a protruding rock, shifted his stance, and was about to dart into the cave.

At that moment an abnormal flare of fire shot from the cave — denser and more intense than any he'd seen before.

The fire wavered and shifted in midair and in the blink of an eye solidified into a Fire Spirit Beast as huge as a python.

"Ninth-tier!" Yang Kai's face altered. He was alarmed to discover this Fire Spirit Beast had assumed a physical body, unlike the seventh- and eighth-tier beasts; it seemed like a living, blooded python.

The great serpent coiled against the rock face and opened a maw like a blood basin, spewing a sheet of red radiance. Before the light even reached him Yang Kai felt unbearable heat and hastily raised Saint Yuan to guard himself.

At the same time a high, resounding dragon cry rang out, and the ink-black giant dragon flashed into view once more.

The golden dragon pattern on Yang Kai's body carried the aura of an ancient great dragon — how could a mere python compare? A python is below a jiao, and a jiao below a dragon; between them stood two whole grades of power.

The ink-black giant dragon and the serpent Fire Spirit Beast instantly clashed, and for a moment the fissure's rock shattered and rained down in fragments.

Yang Kai seized the chance to dart into the cave; when he looked around his face shifted again.

Two more such abnormal flares were materializing, about to transform into ninth-tier Fire Spirit Beasts.

Yang Kai cursed inwardly — his ink-black giant dragon could hold one of them, but could not possibly deal with three simultaneously. If they entangled him he would likely be forced to flee.

In that case, all his efforts would be wasted, and in this cursed place he couldn't fly free; he might not even have the chance to escape to the surface.

Just as anxiety tightened around him, Yang Kai suddenly saw an enormous dark-red stone.

His eyes widened; the aura exuded by that dark-red stone was exactly identical to Crystal Stone, only purer and more concentrated. The pigeon-egg-sized Crystal Stones he'd obtained from eighth-tier Fire Spirit Beasts before were not comparable — those were rubbish next to this.

This dark-red Crystal Stone was as large as a millstone and lay quietly not far before Yang Kai.

Acting almost reflexively, Yang Kai dashed forward, scooped it up, and stuffed it into his Spatial Ring, then sprang back, planning to leave the cave before the other two flares finished forming into ninth-tier Fire Spirit Beasts.

But upon leaping out of the cave he immediately sensed something amiss: the nearly-formed ninth-tier Fire Spirit Beasts had vanished amid a twisting change.

With a thought he looked up and was overjoyed.

The python that had been tangled with his ink-black dragon had also disappeared.

Even the tens of thousands of Fire Spirit Beasts that had chased him down were gone.

Yang Kai's mind cleared and he instantly understood what had happened.

These Fire Spirit Beasts were spawned from that head-sized Crystal Stone; no matter how many he slew earlier, he could not obtain a single Crystal Stone because their source lay inside this cave.

Now that he had thrown the millstone-sized Crystal Stone into his Spatial Ring, those illusory Fire Spirit Beasts became rootless water and naturally could not continue to exist.

Realizing this, Yang Kai couldn't help laughing aloud.

A day's worth of toil had been worth it — that single enormous Crystal Stone alone made the trip worthwhile; even if he gained nothing else afterward, it would not be in vain.

Besides, the Flowing Flame Sandland had only been open a few days; everyone was still rushing in — who could guarantee he wouldn't find something even better later?

Satisfied, Yang Kai recalled the Hundred Mountains Painting and the ink-black giant dragon and drew a slow breath.

The fight had cost him dearly, yet his stores of Saint Yuan were vast; this level of loss he could endure.

After a brief rest in the cave to recover some strength and Divine Sense, Yang Kai climbed back toward the surface using both hands and feet.
