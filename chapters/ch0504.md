## Chapter 504 — Lingxiao Pavilion’s Old Acquaintances

“Still nothing?” Yang Zhao’s expression immediately grew playful as he tapped his fingers lightly on the table. After a long moment, he asked, “Has there been any movement at Ninth Brother’s residence?”

Ye Xinrou shook her head. “No sign of anything.”

Yang Zhao suddenly stood up, a trace of excited smile on his face, and clenched his fist. “No movement is the right kind of movement.”

“Second Young Master, I don’t quite understand,” Ye Xinrou furrowed her delicate brows. “Why is no movement the right thing?”

“No movement means something has already happened!” Yang Zhao smiled faintly. “Ninth Brother and Ying Jiu have already mobilized.”

“They’ve already mobilized?” Ye Xinrou was startled. If Second Young Master’s words were true, then Yang Kai’s audacity was truly extraordinary.

“Ying Jiu is skilled in stealth and assassination. He comes and goes without a trace. Even as he enters and leaves War City, our men cannot detect him,” Yang Zhao patiently explained.

“What about the Young Master? Does he possess the same skill?” Ye Xinrou couldn’t help but curl her lips, unconvinced that Yang Kai—no matter how strong—could vanish as silently as Ying Jiu.

After all, Yang Zhao had planted many spies around Yang Kai’s residence. Any slightest disturbance there would be immediately reported.

“I too doubted it at first, but I believe Ninth Brother is capable. When he attacked Fifth Brother’s estate, Eldest Brother led men to contain me. Do you know why?”

“Obviously Eldest Young Master and the Young Master formed an alliance.” Ye Xinrou was suspicious. “I know that, but what’s the problem?”

“The problem lies there. No one knows when Ninth Brother allied with Eldest Brother, which means he could visit Eldest Brother’s estate without us knowing and negotiate in detail. Eldest Brother wouldn’t act rashly otherwise. If he could do that then, he surely can now!”

“Moreover, Pang Chi entered Ninth Brother’s estate and never left. Clearly, he carried some extremely important intelligence and was temporarily held there. If the information wasn’t crucial, Pang Chi would have left...” 

Listening to Yang Zhao’s analysis, Ye Xinrou’s eyes brightened. His reasoning made sense.

“Interesting...” Yang Zhao chuckled. “Bamboo Segment Gang is a faction under Ninth Brother. I’ve known that for some time. I also know he’s been using Bamboo Segment Gang’s people to search for something. Is he looking for someone or something...?”

“Whether searching for someone or something, the Young Master is surely determined to obtain it. And now, he already has the intelligence he wants,” Ye Xinrou’s beautiful eyes gleamed differently; Yang Zhao’s train of thought had opened hers, clarity dawning. “If that’s the case, we might still be able to interfere.”

“That’s exactly what I’m thinking.” Yang Zhao smiled faintly. “The key is, I don’t know which direction Ninth Brother went. If I knew...”

The struggle for succession had lasted over two months. Although his own faction had grown stronger in that time, Yang Kai’s forces were equally formidable. Naturally, Yang Zhao hoped to exploit every possible means to break the stalemate.

Yang Kai’s departure was undoubtedly the best opportunity. Capturing him would render any experts within his residence powerless.

However, Yang Zhao remained wary of the experts guarding Yang Kai’s residence.

“Second Young Master, should I return to Zhongdu and inquire among Bamboo Segment Gang’s people?” Ye Xinrou suddenly suggested. There was no way to gather intelligence directly from Yang Kai’s estate, but since Bamboo Segment Gang originally discovered this information, they might know more details.

“Bamboo Segment Gang... as far as I know, since the succession war began, they have swallowed up several small factions. Pang Chi’s abilities are limited, and his management is poor. The group isn’t united, especially Mu Nandou, who recently joined but resents Pang Chi and is even less loyal to Ninth Brother. He only tolerates the situation because of fear of the Yang Family’s power. You should go see him! If we offer appropriate conditions, I think he will cooperate,” Yang Zhao said.

“What if he refuses?”

Yang Zhao smiled coldly and reached out to pinch Ye Xinrou’s smooth chin, lifting it slightly. “I don’t have to teach you what to do then.”

“I understand.” Ye Xinrou’s cheeks flushed, her eyes clouded with a subtle haze as she nodded gently.

“No time to waste. Leave now. At the latest by tomorrow afternoon, I want accurate news!”

Ye Xinrou smiled faintly and disappeared into the night.

...

Under the dark sky, two figures streaked forward like the wind, covering hundreds of zhang in an instant, swift as lightning.

Yang Kai led ahead, Ying Jiu trailing behind. Despite the vast gap in cultivation between them—exceeding a whole great realm—Ying Jiu had to use eighty percent of his strength just to keep up.

Knowing Yang Kai must be anxious, Ying Jiu silently followed without a word, the only sound the flapping of their robes in the night air.

After a day and a night of relentless speed, even a master like Ying Jiu was slightly breathless. He had taken a pill to replenish True Yuan to maintain his peak state and prepare for any emergencies. In contrast, Yang Kai’s face remained serene, his expression growing only more expectant and excited, showing no fatigue.

Ying Jiu did not even see Yang Kai take any pills!

He was stunned. He truly had no idea how much True Yuan Yang Kai stored to remain so calm and composed.

One day, one night, nearly two thousand li travelled at full speed—surely that took a toll?

After no rest, through yet another night, when the eastern sky showed a faint hint of dawn, Yang Kai suddenly stopped, hovering midair and looking down.

Below was a dense forest, seemingly a vast expanse of mountains stretching endlessly. Ancient verdant trees towered skyward, lush and thick, with mist swirling like a celestial land beyond the mortal realm—ethereal and elusive.

Within the mountains, marks of Demonic Beasts’ activity could be seen, alongside plentiful high-quality herbs.

More than a hundred people of Lingxiao Pavilion dwelled in this secluded forest.

A fine place! Yang Kai smiled faintly as his extraordinarily powerful Divine Sense spread instantly in all directions. Closing his eyes, his Divine Sense extended as if he could see with his own eyes—every blade of grass and tree perfectly clear.

Those Bamboo Segment Gang people might have only stumbled upon this place by luck; it was not easily discovered.

After a long moment, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense, showing a hint of disappointment. Though his Divine Sense covered a vast range, he sensed no human presence, not even signs of activity.

“Young Master, shall we search separately?” Ying Jiu asked.

“No need,” Yang Kai shook his head. “Within a certain range, I can sense it.”

Though Ying Jiu was unclear what method Yang Kai used to sense things, he said no more.

The map Pang Chi had given Yang Kai showed only a rough location, not very precise, but with it, Yang Kai could still determine the general direction to search.

An hour later, Yang Kai stopped again amid his flight, a trace of delight appearing on his face as he looked toward a certain direction.

“Follow me!” he called out to Ying Jiu, dashing swiftly that way.

After a short time, Ying Jiu indeed spotted a cluster of newly built thatched huts in a mountain hollow ringed by peaks.

Their arrival seemed to alarm those living there, as several experts of the Divine Roaming Realm quietly emerged, focusing their gaze on the newcomers with great wariness.

Ying Jiu secretly observed that the highest among these few was only at the Fourth Stage of Divine Roaming Realm, and quite aged. Their True Yuan was not very pure either.

Strangely, the sect Young Master came from was not supposed to lack experts beyond Divine Roaming Realm. With the Young Master as a rising genius, these people’s strength was unexpectedly weak.

Those below seemed to recognize Yang Kai, murmuring softly and pointing upwards. Their defenses quickly eased, replaced by joyful expressions.

Before they even arrived, Yang Kai smiled and waved at them, to which they responded promptly. One called out sharply, and instantly doors of all houses opened as nearly a hundred people emerged, all visibly excited.

Yang Kai spotted Su Mu, Li Yuntian, and others, evoking a warm feeling within him.

Shortly after, Yang Kai and Ying Jiu landed on the ground and hurried forward, clasping hands in greeting. “Disciple pays respects to senior uncles and aunts!”

“How did you find this place?” one senior uncle in his forties asked suspiciously. “Weren’t you supposed to be in War City participating in the succession war?”

“There was nothing happening there. I had been sending people to track you all, only recently got accurate information, so I came right away.” Yang Kai inhaled deeply, then glanced around. Familiar and unfamiliar faces alike looked at him with excitement.

“Brother-in-law!” Su Mu dashed forward, greeting him warmly.

Yang Kai chuckled and patted his shoulder.

Seeing Su Mu, Yang Kai was moved. In over a year apart, Su Mu had grown from the Ninth Stage of Separation and Union Realm to the Fifth Stage of True Yuan Realm. Though not exceptional among the young generation, it was impressive to Yang Kai.

“Come inside and talk!” several senior uncles of Lingxiao Pavilion called out eagerly.

The place was simply constructed, only as livable as necessary. Inside, the senior uncles subtly tried to inquire about Ying Jiu’s identity. Upon learning he was a Blood Servant of the Yang Family, their expressions changed to awe and extreme caution.

For them, a Blood Servant of the Yang Family was an existence to revere. Ying Jiu kept no airs, nodding slightly to anyone who greeted him, but his naturally cold face still kept people at a respectful distance.

With tea served, Yang Kai began to ask about their past year. The senior uncles replied one after another, detailing the events that had transpired.
