## Chapter 2331 — Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm

His Origin Qi drained away far faster than he had imagined. In the blink of an eye, he felt utterly exhausted.

He knew it would be like this! Yang Kai’s face was bitter.

Every time he used the Extinction Thunder Bead, he ended up completely spent. That was the main reason Yang Kai never used it lightly. Using the Extinction Thunder Bead was a one-shot deal—if it didn’t succeed, he’d be finished. It was his final trump card.

Maybe when his cultivation grew stronger, he could wield the Extinction Thunder Bead more freely and things would improve.

But for now, he was not up to it.

After draining Yang Kai’s strength, the arcs of lightning dancing on the bead’s surface grew even more lively, as if they possessed their own spirit—truly wondrous. And within those seemingly frail arcs, a terrifying power could be felt.

“Let’s see if you die this time!” Yang Kai gritted his teeth and muttered, his Divine Sense surging as he summoned the Extinction Thunder Bead.

Sss...

A faint sound rang out. A thin arc of lightning appeared, bouncing and then striking the Corpse Puppet.

Crackle...

The deafening noise continued. The Corpse Puppet convulsed violently, lightning flooding its body, electric light flickering. In an instant, a massive Thunder Pool formed beneath it, countless arcs weaving through its body, tearing it apart.

A foul stench spread, making one want to retch.

Soon, the lightning faded. The Corpse Puppet collapsed onto its back, a haze of green smoke rising from its body.

Seeing this, Yang Kai let out a long breath. His body swayed, nearly collapsing, but a soft figure came up behind him to support him—it was Liu Yan.

“I’m fine, just spent. I need to recover a bit,” Yang Kai said before Liu Yan could speak, then sat down shakily, his whole body weak and sore.

If someone ambushed him now, even an Origin Returning Realm cultivator could defeat him, let alone someone from the Dao Origin Realm.

“Then I’ll guard you, Master!” Liu Yan said. Suddenly, her body stiffened.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai sensed something amiss and quickly asked.

But before Liu Yan could answer, Yang Kai's eyes widened in shock.

He saw the Corpse Puppet, which had fallen to the ground, suddenly stand up straight again, roaring fiercely, its violent aura growing even stronger.

“Still not dead?” Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. He could hardly believe his eyes.

The Extinction Thunder Bead was the strongest attack he could muster, yet even that couldn’t finish off this Corpse Puppet. Its strength was truly terrifying.

Though Yang Kai had other tricks, he was too weak to use them now.

Looking over, the Corpse Puppet’s body was in tatters, its dried flesh charred, the formation diagrams branded inside it had dimmed, and the weak point Yang Kai had found was completely destroyed.

That should have been the core of the formation inside the Corpse Puppet. With it destroyed, the Corpse Puppet should have lost all ability to move. So why could it still stand?

In his panic, Yang Kai suddenly noticed something strange on the Corpse Puppet’s chest. His expression trembled, and he gave a bitter smile. There was another core formation diagram glowing there!

It was this backup core that kept the Corpse Puppet fighting.

“Master!” Liu Yan was terrified. Facing such a powerful enemy, without Yang Kai and the Incarnation’s help, she couldn’t hope to resist alone. But she quickly calmed down, her face resolute: “Master, you go first. I’ll hold him off for a while.”

She thought that as long as she gave Yang Kai a little time, he could repair the Formation Foundation platform and escape this secret realm.

As she spoke, she flashed in front of Yang Kai, determined to protect him even at the cost of her life.

Yang Kai tugged at her. Liu Yan turned, giving a sorrowful smile: "Having Master treat me sincerely all these years, I haven’t come to this world in vain. Take care of yourself from now on."

“Don’t make it sound so tragic.” Yang Kai’s nose stung, but he still managed a smile. “It’s not certain yet who will live and who will die.”

Liu Yan’s beautiful eyes lit up: “Master still has another move?”

Yang Kai didn’t answer. Instead, he flipped his hand and took out a pill, pressing it into Liu Yan’s palm: “Channel its power. If that’s not enough, we’ll hide together in the Small Xuan Realm and recover.”

“This is...” Liu Yan looked at the pill in her hand, her eyes brightening as she exclaimed, “Emperor Extinction Pill?”

“That’s right. This Emperor Extinction Pill contains a strike from the Great Emperor of Time. I don’t know which era he refined it in, but its power should be considerable. Try it.”

This Emperor Extinction Pill was one Yang Kai had traded a Supreme Mystic Pill for in the Four Seasons Land. It definitely sealed a full-powered strike from the Great Emperor of Time, but Yang Kai didn’t know exactly how strong it was.

The Emperor Extinction Pill was different from the Extinction Thunder Bead, an Imperial Treasure. It was single-use—once used, it was gone.

Yang Kai had kept it until now, never willing to use it. But in this situation, he had no choice.

With the Emperor Extinction Pill in hand, Liu Yan calmed down, took a deep breath, and poured all her strength into the pill.

Meanwhile, after the Corpse Puppet stood up again, it seemed stiff and moved awkwardly. Clearly, the Extinction Thunder Bead’s strike had affected it greatly.

Sensing something, the Corpse Puppet roared, its body shooting toward Liu Yan like an arrow. Even before it reached her, a corpse stench filled the air, and a chilling killing intent enveloped Liu Yan.

Liu Yan’s delicate body trembled, but she remained unmoved, channeling her power into the Emperor Extinction Pill.

The distance between them closed rapidly. Even Yang Kai was sweating nervously, clutching the Xuan Realm Pearl, ready to take Liu Yan and hide inside at any moment.

As the Corpse Puppet leapt at Liu Yan, she finally acted. She flicked the Emperor Extinction Pill, sending it flying toward the Corpse Puppet as a streak of light.

The Corpse Puppet punched out, its force enough to shatter space, smashing the Emperor Extinction Pill to pieces.

Yet...

From the shattered Emperor Extinction Pill, a wondrous power erupted, transforming into Law Power and instantly enveloping the Corpse Puppet. Under its influence, the Corpse Puppet froze in midair and crashed headfirst into the ground.

Boom...

That wondrous Law Power spread out in all directions.

In the valley, the grass and trees that had all died from corpse poison suddenly revived, bursting with life. In an instant, the valley was lush and green.

Not only that, this wondrous power spread far and wide, and everywhere it passed, the trees swayed joyfully, conveying a sense of happiness.

Yang Kai and Liu Yan were also enveloped by this power.

The energy flowed into their bodies, and the weak Yang Kai felt revitalized, his spirit restored. Even the injuries he’d suffered from the Corpse Puppet healed in no time.

“This is...” Liu Yan’s beautiful eyes widened in surprise.

“The Law of Spring!” Yang Kai was equally shocked, his eyes bright as he grasped the essence of the law.

He didn’t dare waste time and quickly focused on comprehending it.

This was Law Power comprehended by the Great Emperor of Time, unfathomably profound. With the Emperor Extinction Pill unleashed, it was as if the Great Emperor himself had struck. If Yang Kai could glean even a little from it, he would benefit greatly.

At this moment, Yang Kai couldn’t even care about the Corpse Puppet’s fate. He was completely immersed in the wondrous Law Power.

The Law of Spring spread, restoring the valley’s lush greenery. But in an instant, a sweltering heat covered everything, as if summer had arrived. The sound of cicadas buzzed in his ears, the blazing sun making the heat unbearable.

The Law of Summer!

Yang Kai understood, realizing this was an opportunity he couldn’t miss.

Suddenly, autumn winds swept through the valley, red maple leaves fell, the ground was carpeted with leaves, and the scent of ripe fruit filled the air—a pleasant harvest atmosphere.

The Law of Autumn!

A cold wind howled, and the surroundings turned bitterly cold. Snow blanketed everything, the world wrapped in silver. In the harsh winter, even the hardiest beasts hid in their dens, not daring to venture out.

The Law of Winter!

The four laws intertwined, tightly interwoven, forming a unique power that lingered in the valley, making one lose all sense of time. It felt like an instant, yet also like ten million years had passed...

Yang Kai was completely absorbed, unable to extricate himself.

Under the influence of the power of the four seasons, he witnessed spring, summer, autumn, and winter cycling endlessly, forgetting where he was or what he was doing—only knowing that missing this opportunity would be a great loss.

Who knows how much time had passed. With a crisp crack, Yang Kai shuddered, his meridians and Dantian expanded, Origin Qi surged like a river through his channels.

A powerful aura spread out from him in all directions!

He had broken through!

He had advanced to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

The commotion of his breakthrough brought Yang Kai back to his senses. He immediately saw the Corpse Puppet sitting cross-legged not far away, and all that had happened flashed through his mind.

His face changed, and he stood up, watching the motionless Corpse Puppet warily.

“Master!” Liu Yan saw his expression and called out quickly.

“How long has it been?” Yang Kai frowned, uncertain.

“What do you mean, how long?” Liu Yan looked confused.

“From when you used the Emperor Extinction Pill until now, how much time has passed?”

Liu Yan replied, puzzled, “Just now. After I used the Emperor Extinction Pill, you sat down, and then... you suddenly broke through.”

“Just now?” Yang Kai’s mouth fell open. He felt as if ages had passed, but from Liu Yan’s words, it had only been a moment.

He shuddered, realizing he must have been affected by the power of the four seasons, falling into an illusion.
