## Chapter 2359 — The Great Jixu Whirlpool

In this desolate wilderness, Yang Kai suddenly told her to take off her clothes, and he used a tone that brooked no argument. Naturally, Liu Qianyun was both angry and embarrassed, and couldn’t help but let her mind wander.

Yang Kai said, “That jade box was marked by Yao Changjun, so he can track our position. I don’t know if your clothes have been marked too, but we have to be careful. Change into a different set of clothes.”

Hearing his explanation, Liu Qianyun finally understood what Yang Kai meant and realized she had misunderstood his intentions. For a moment, her face flushed bright red.

She wasn’t a shy little girl, though. Once she knew the reason, she immediately began to undress.

In no time, she changed into another set of clothes and burned her original set to ashes with a single fire.

Three thousand li away, Yao Changjun’s figure suddenly halted, his face turning ashen. Just now, he had sensed that the tracking mark he’d planted had vanished without a trace.

Back at the teahouse, after snatching the jade box from Yang Kai, he had immediately branded it with a mark. It wasn’t that he could foresee everything; he was simply cautious. He had waited in Gao City for two hundred years to finally see the Divine Butian Lotus—how could he not be careful?

As it turned out, his caution had allowed him to pursue Yang Kai relentlessly for five days.

But just now, the mark had suddenly disappeared.

Yao Changjun realized immediately that Yang Kai must have discovered and erased the mark. What he couldn’t understand was how a mere Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm like Yang Kai could erase his mark!

The difference in strength was unmistakable.

In that instant, Yao Changjun was both furious and anxious. He threw his head back and roared to the heavens, “Brat! Even if I have to search every corner of heaven and earth, I will drag you back!”

Even without the mark to guide him, Yao Changjun was unwilling to give up. The Divine Butian Lotus was not something one could see every day. This encounter was pure chance—if he missed it, he might never see it again.

He swore to himself that no matter what, he would find Yang Kai, tear him to pieces, and reclaim the Divine Butian Lotus.

Deep within Jixu Ridge, Yang Kai’s expression was grim.

Although he had finally shaken off Yao Changjun, Yang Kai found that his situation hadn’t improved. This damned place had actually gotten him lost.

He asked Liu Qianyun, but she also didn’t know how to get out. She’d only been this deep once before, and that time she’d only managed to leave by sheer luck.

The surrounding environment seemed cut from the same mold. Yang Kai wandered for most of the day, dizzy and disoriented, unsure if he was going in circles. Even his Divine Sense couldn’t extend far—some mysterious force here suppressed his spiritual perception.

At a certain moment, Yang Kai suddenly stopped, scanning his surroundings with a grave expression.

“Senior Brother, what’s wrong?” Liu Qianyun asked nervously.

“Do you feel like the ground is moving?” Yang Kai asked.

Liu Qianyun broke out in a cold sweat. Although Yang Kai’s tone was calm, the meaning behind his words sent chills down her spine.

“Maybe it’s just an illusion…” Yang Kai muttered to himself.

Liu Qianyun swallowed and whispered, “Senior Brother, there’s always been a saying about Jixu Ridge…”

“What saying?”

“Some say Jixu Ridge… is alive.” Liu Qianyun’s pretty face turned pale.

“Alive?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

“Yes.” Liu Qianyun nodded and said, “The terrain of Jixu Ridge is always changing, so there’s never been a map. Sometimes, the landscape in a certain place changes extremely fast. Other times, it changes so slowly that no one notices. But most people believe Jixu Ridge is alive.”

Yang Kai frowned deeply, pondering for a while. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. “That theory might not be entirely correct, but there’s definitely some basis for it.”

“What do you mean?” Liu Qianyun looked at Yang Kai in confusion.

Yang Kai said, “Junior Sister, you’ve always been active on the outskirts of Jixu Ridge. Don’t you often find good things there?”

“Yes,” Liu Qianyun replied. “Not just me—many people in Gao City are the same.”

Yang Kai nodded. “Since so many people are always searching the outskirts, in theory, there shouldn’t be anything left. Even if there were, it would have been taken long ago. But you still manage to find good things often…”

“That’s always puzzled me too,” Liu Qianyun nodded. She’d been to Jixu Ridge many times, and except for a few unlucky trips, she always managed to find something useful for her cultivation on the outskirts.

But this was clearly abnormal.

“Senior Brother, you mean…”

Yang Kai said, “Jixu Ridge is moving. Every so often, the land from the depths flows to the outskirts, and the spiritual herbs and medicines from deep inside naturally appear on the edges. That’s why there are always good things to be found there.”

“How do you know that?” Liu Qianyun was astonished. She’d lived in Jixu Ridge for years and never thought of this, yet Yang Kai had figured it out after just a few days.

Yang Kai smiled slightly. “Just a guess. I’m not sure if I’m right.”

Still, this guess was likely correct, as it perfectly explained why good things always appeared on the outskirts of Jixu Ridge. This land was alive, writhing and rolling at a speed imperceptible to ordinary people. When the land from the depths flowed outward, it naturally brought treasures with it.

Yet the martial artists within Jixu Ridge were like those unable to see the mountain’s true form while standing upon it, utterly incapable of perceiving the changes taking place there.

Rustle rustle…

At that moment, the sound of flapping wings suddenly echoed all around. Countless birds shot up from the dense forest as if startled, and the beasts on the ground began to flee in panic, running about like headless flies.

In less than three breaths, the entire Jixu Ridge was thrown into chaos.

“What’s happening?” Liu Qianyun’s face changed as she cried out in alarm.

Yang Kai was also baffled, but in the next instant, his expression changed. He saw that the birds soaring into the sky had all frozen in midair. No matter how they flapped their wings, they couldn’t move forward at all.

It was as if some invisible force was restraining them.

Among those birds were even Eleventh-Tier Demonic Beasts. Yang Kai even spotted a Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast comparable to the Emperor Realm.

Just as Yang Kai was growing suspicious, the ground beneath his feet suddenly began to flow rapidly. He lost his footing and nearly fell, and at the same time, a powerful suction came from deeper within Jixu Ridge, pulling at his body, trying to drag him away.

Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. Without hesitation, he wrapped Liu Qianyun in Origin Qi and tried to use his spatial power to escape.

But even as his spatial power surged, he remained rooted in place.

Sensing carefully, Yang Kai cried out, “The laws are shattered!”

The laws of this world had become utterly broken in the midst of this upheaval. He couldn’t use spatial laws to leave. Meanwhile, the ground’s flow grew even faster, making Yang Kai dizzy. Liu Qianyun fared even worse—she couldn’t keep her footing and could only cling to Yang Kai’s waist.

The suction from the depths became even more terrifying. Even with Yang Kai’s cultivation, he could barely resist. No matter how he tried to stabilize himself, all the birds and beasts were already being dragged away, vanishing from sight in the blink of an eye. The weaker ones even exploded into clouds of blood.

For a moment, the roars of beasts and cries of birds filled the air, and Jixu Ridge became a scene of utter chaos.

Three thousand li away, Yao Changjun’s face was also filled with terror. He frantically roused his Emperor Yuan, trying to break free from the world’s restraints, but even with his cultivation, he could only barely remain in place and not be dragged away.

“The Great Jixu Whirlpool!” Yao Changjun’s face turned extremely dark. Even his steadfast Emperor’s Heart trembled slightly in fear.

Unlike the newly arrived Yang Kai and the relatively inexperienced Liu Qianyun, Yao Changjun had studied Jixu Ridge thoroughly. He knew that while this place usually seemed harmless, at certain times it could erupt with a force of heaven and earth that even the Emperors could not resist.

This was the moment when the Great Jixu Whirlpool appeared!

The Great Jixu Whirlpool was truly a calamity that destroyed and reshaped Jixu Ridge.

Yang Kai’s earlier guess was correct—Jixu Ridge was indeed constantly shifting and writhing, with its terrain always changing. That’s why cultivators on the outskirts could always find good things.

But this shifting and writhing was usually very slow and didn’t pose much danger to those training here. Because cultivators were inside Jixu Ridge, they generally couldn’t sense the changes. By the time they noticed, the transformation was already complete.

However, when the speed of this shifting reached an extreme, the entire Jixu Ridge would spin like a mad top, and in that spinning, it would be reshaped.

This was the Great Jixu Whirlpool!

No one knew why Jixu Ridge was like this. The wonders of heaven and earth were unfathomable. Yao Changjun had entered and exited Jixu Ridge many times but could never figure it out. The Great Jixu Whirlpool only appeared every few hundred or thousand years. According to Yao Changjun, the last time it appeared was six hundred years ago, and it devoured countless cultivators who had entered Jixu Ridge. This time would clearly be no exception.

And as luck would have it, he had run right into it.

Yao Changjun hated Yang Kai to the bone, thinking that if not for that brat’s interference, he wouldn’t have risked coming here and wouldn’t be facing this unstoppable calamity.

If he were still on the outskirts of Jixu Ridge, his powerful cultivation would have let him escape for sure. But to chase Yang Kai, he’d gone deep inside! When the Great Whirlpool appeared, the closer to the center, the more terrifying the suction, and the harder it was to resist. Now, he was only two thousand li from the very heart of Jixu Ridge—there was no escape for him.
