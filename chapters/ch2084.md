## Chapter 2084 — Repay Grudges

"Jiang—Jiang Chuhe?" Qin Yu's beautiful eyes widened in astonishment as she stared in disbelief at the demon on the ground, suppressed by restraining power and struggling relentlessly; her face was full of incredulity.

She discovered that the demon was, astonishingly, Jiang Chuhe—the outstanding scion of the Jiang Family's new generation.

As descendants of the prominent families of Fenglin City, Qin Yu and Jiang Chuhe had frequent dealings and of course she recognized him; she never would have expected that a demon pillaging outside Fenglin City would be someone she knew.

The Jiang Family had carelessly excavated a mine and broken a seal, causing the pure Demonic Qi of an Ancient Great Demon to leak out; only a handful of Dao Origin Realm experts in all of Fenglin City knew of this, and to the other martial artists it remained a secret.

It wasn't that Duan Yuanshan feared revealing the secret would cause chaos; he simply had no time to make it public.

"How could it be him?" Qin Yu could not make sense of it.

"My heavens, isn't that Young Master Jiang?"

"Really Young Master Jiang? Only half a month ago I was drinking flower wine with him at the Drunken Moon Brothel—how did he..."

After the surrounding martial artists recognized Jiang Chuhe's face, one after another they were likewise incredulous.

One of them even wore an expression of heartbroken sorrow, for indeed half a month ago he had been in Fenglin City's largest flower house embracing beauties and drinking the finest flower wine with Jiang Chuhe, living wantonly.

In barely half a month, the once stately and debonair Eldest Young Master Jiang had been reduced to such a pitiful sight that he couldn't help but be filled with a thousand emotions.

"Keep an eye on him, what are you afraid of? He's already been suppressed by Young Brother Yang; his cultivation has been sealed—he's a cripple!" Qin Chaoyang barked from the side, his expression oppressive.

At Qin Chaoyang's words, the gathered martial artists couldn't help but let the corners of their mouths twitch.

They had all seen earlier how, in a moment of alarm, Qin Chaoyang had palm-struck Jiang Chuhe, shattering his bones.

Yet at this moment none dared to speak it aloud; they surged forward and used restraining techniques to bind Jiang Chuhe, examining him with curiosity.

Jiang Chuhe seemed to have lost all sanity; even when faced with familiar faces he showed no hint of recognition, instead roaring and emitting terrifying low howls from his throat.

Outside the city, Yang Kai stood alone at the breach, blocking the last opening and unleashing Undying Five Elements Sword Qi to fend off the onslaught of countless demons.

The World-Ending Demon Eye looked ahead and saw, within the boundless rolling Demonic Qi, a disheveled figure darting left and right; a faint phosphorescence clung to him, and for reasons unknown he could resist the Demonic Qi's corrosion and was frantically fleeing in this direction.

“Ah! My lord, you are truly my lifesaving benefactor—many thanks, many thanks! Your grace this humble one will etch into his heart. Hereafter I shall bow to you three times at dawn and three times at dusk, and burn a stick of incense morning and evening, praying that my lord enjoys a lifespan of one hundred years!”

The man sped toward Yang Kai while chattering incessantly.

Yang Kai watched in astonishment, for the man's footwork was extraordinarily nimble; despite charging alone through a tide of monsters he moved with ease, never struck by them, and still had the leisure to offer thanks.

Yang Kai muttered with a dark look: "A hundred years is hardly long for people like us; you're wishing me an early death and swift rebirth!"

"Slip of the tongue, slip of the tongue..." the man realized his earlier words were inappropriate, and in an instant he had sprung a dozen or so zhang ahead of Yang Kai.

"No more nonsense, hurry inside!" Yang Kai snapped, impatient; seeing the breach behind him about to seal, he did not bother with the man and turned, slipping through the gap into the city.

"Sir, wait for me!" the man cried, his speed suddenly increasing as he followed Yang Kai through the breach into the city.

With no target remaining to occupy them, the countless demons and the rolling Demonic Qi indeed surged toward the city.

But the Formation Masters, who had been waiting for the moment, would not relent; their formation plates flared with dazzling radiance and transformed into streams of energy that shot into the formation, and the broken gap quickly closed and was soon fully repaired.

Boom, boom, boom...

The demons struck the formation's light curtain repeatedly and the Demonic Qi roiled without cease, yet everyone exhaled a small sigh of relief—so long as the defensive formation held, there was little to fear.

"You lot, quickly reinforce the weak points here; under no circumstances let the demons break through the formation again!" Qin Chaoyang roared at the Formation Masters.

The men obeyed and immediately manipulated their formation plates.

"Young Brother Yang, we owe you this time; if not for you, Fenglin City would have—" Qin Chaoyang, pale with fear, cupped his hands and thanked Yang Kai.

The Demonic Qi and monsters outside the city were so ferocious that he could not afford to underestimate that breach; if the formation failed to be repaired, the sky-darkening tide of Demonic Qi would inevitably surge into the city, and then among Fenglin City's hundreds of thousands of martial artists, how many could possibly hold out?

He could almost picture Fenglin City drowned in slaughter! If that came to pass, he would be the city's sinner, for that section of the wall was his responsibility.

"Sir Qin, no need for thanks; it was my duty," Yang Kai waved his hand, brushing it off, and instead turned his curious gaze to the man who had just burst in from outside.

The next moment he showed surprise and lowly said, "It's you, you old conman!"

Earlier outside the city Yang Kai hadn't seen the man's face; only after slipping through the breach did he realize that the bold, one-man army who had charged through the demon tide was none other than that lecherous old swindler!

That old man had once cheated Mo Xiaoqi out of thousands of Source Crystals in the black market, and before the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda opened he had been hawking his ancestral, absurdly named Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill that supposedly revived flesh and bone—business had seemed brisk.

Yang Kai could never have imagined that the old swindler harbored such an astonishing secret.

Not every Void King Realm cultivator could come and go within the Demonic Qi unharmed; although the old con now looked panting and as if he had barely survived, at least he had survived.

Yang Kai was puzzled and uncertain, not knowing what mystery the old man harbored that allowed him to dwell long within the Demonic Qi and resist its corruption and demonic transformation.

From this alone the old con was not someone ordinary.

"Sir, don't speak so harshly..." the old conman said, embarrassed and chuckling awkwardly, "I only make a living, I haven't truly cheated anyone."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai smiled, eyes fixed on him with meaning.

The old conman spoke seriously: "In business I have always been honest with young and old, my prices fair, never forcing a sale; to call me a swindler is slander. I'm a businessman—integrity is everything!"

"You bastard! What about that Golden Spear Pill you sold me last time..." suddenly a martial artist pushed forward from the crowd, anger written across his face as he glared at the old con as if he had been greatly wronged.

"Useless?" the old conman gaped in disbelief. "Impossible — that thing was brewed from my family's ancestral secret recipe, its effects are astonishing. Brother, surely you didn't use it the proper way, did you?"

The man asked incredulously, "Besides eating it, what else is it for?"

The old swindler slapped his thigh, heartsick with anguish. “You fool! How could you eat a Golden Spear Pill? You’re supposed to grind it into powder with water and then… smear it!”

The questioner widened his eyes so far they nearly popped out.

"Smear what? Smear where?" Qin Yu asked with innocent curiosity.

Qin Chaoyang coughed, embarrassed and unsure how to respond, his face crimson.

The old con glanced at Qin Yu and waved his hand, "Little girl, don't ask so many questions!"

Qin Yu pouted, indignant.

The old conman stared at the martial artist again with a lecherous expression and softly asked, "Brother, you didn't actually swallow it, did you?"

The martial artist flushed and remained silent.

The old con clapped his hands and laughed: "So you swallowed it—haha, brother, you're lucky. The Golden Spear Pill can be ingested, but if taken directly you'll have a spear that never droops for forty-nine days... hmm, let me think, the last time I saw you was..."

“Bastard!” The warrior, suddenly flushed with rage and shame, barreled forward and unleashed a flurry of fists on the old swindler, shouting between strikes, “Repay your grudges! Settle your scores! Any brothers who have beef with this old fox—join in!”

At that cry, dozens of men surged forward.

With a flurry of noise, punctuated by the old con's wails and pleas, Qin Yu watched in alarm and pity.

A short while later, the crowd dispersed, leaving only the old swindler lying there bruised and swollen, as though he were a maiden ravaged by dozens of burly men. Two clear tears traced down from the corners of his eyes—utterly wretched to behold.

But then all eyes turned to the martial artist who had acted first; one after another, looks of sudden understanding crossed their faces. No wonder this brother had been wearing such extraordinarily loose robes and walking with a bent back these past days — they had assumed he was wounded, but it seemed he was hiding some embarrassing secret.

Under everyone's gaze the martial artist's face flushed, he barked and fled from the scene.

"Ahem..." Qin Chaoyang coughed and asked Yang Kai with concern, "Young Brother Yang, are you uninjured?"

"I'm fine!" Yang Kai shook his head.

"That's good!" Qin Chaoyang breathed a sigh of relief and said, "The City Lord's mansion has been informed; thanks to your effort the formation was repaired. City Lord Duan says that once this calamity passes he intends to appoint you as Fenglin City's third Deputy City Lord—what do you think, Young Brother Yang?"

"Deputy City Lord?" Yang Kai raised a brow and smiled, "Lord Duan flatters me, but I'm not interested in such a post."

"Haha, Young Brother Yang must be used to a carefree, unbound life. The post of Deputy City Lord may look splendid, but it brings endless cares and worries — your decision is a wise one!” Qin Chaoyang laughed heartily, his face relaxing for reasons he couldn’t explain, then added, “Rather than taking a Deputy City Lord title, I think you’d be better off joining a clan and serving as a Guest Elder — enjoying true ease and freedom!”
