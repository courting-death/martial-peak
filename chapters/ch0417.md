## Chapter 417 — He Is a Grasshopper After the Autumn Harvest

Huo Xingchen clearly had no faith in Yang Kai. “Isn’t the Dong Family your mother’s clan? Why haven’t they appeared this time? Could it be that they’ve abandoned you as well?”

If at this moment Yang Kai had the backing of a first-rate noble family, the situation would likely not be so dire.

“They will come,” Yang Kai grinned, an inscrutable smile playing on his lips. “Just not today.”

“What do you mean?” Qiu Yimeng asked in astonishment. From Yang Kai’s smile, she sensed a hint of conspiracy. But even with her sharp wits, she could not fathom what scheme he might be hiding.

“Do as you please. You don’t need to worry about today’s matter for now. When soldiers come, I’ll face them; when waters rise, I’ll drown them.” Yang Kai said casually, then led Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu further inside.

“What kind of a man are you…” Qiu Yimeng hurried a few steps after him, only to see Yang Kai stride forward without looking back even once. She was vexed and angrily stomped her foot, grinding her teeth.

Now more than ever, she was convinced Yang Kai had a saving strategy, but the man refused to explain things clearly, filling Qiu Yimeng with a sense of hopelessness.

Every time she dealt with Yang Kai, she was led by the nose, never gaining the upper hand nor grasping his true thoughts or his next move.

Slippery as a loach! Qiu Yimeng cursed inwardly.

Standing still for a moment, Qiu Yimeng snorted and turned to arrange the defenses for the Autumn Rain Hall she had brought along. Although Autumn Rain Hall had no experts, some tricks and traps could be arranged around the mansion’s perimeter.

War City. Hongyuan Tavern.

Inside the bustling tavern, an endless stream of customers poured in, waiters running frantically amidst the lively scene.

Before the succession war began, many had already gathered in War City. This was the battlefield for the Yang Family’s succession, and naturally, some came early to wait for the arrival of the Yang Family heirs.

At a window-side table sat a slightly plump young man, about twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, leisurely sipping fine wine and sampling sumptuous dishes.

On either side of him sat two decrepit old men, looking senile and feeble. They appeared unremarkable and motionless, their eyes half-closed as if asleep, but hidden behind their eyelids were watchful eyes observing every guest in the tavern.

Voices buzzed throughout the tavern, with customers recounting the events that had taken place outside the South Gate today.

The two elders and the young man listened carefully. After some time, one elder spoke, “Young Master, from this it seems the future looks bleak for Master Kai.”

Yang Kai had only Huo Xingchen for assistance, and could not mobilize any of the Huo Family’s power. He was essentially unsupported.

“It is indeed so.” The other elder nodded gently. “Shall we not go to his residence and offer help?”

“I would like to,” the plump youth muttered with a troubled face, “but that brat sent word to me a couple days ago, telling me not to intervene today, to simply watch and wait.”

“Not intervene?” The elder who had spoken earlier frowned. “But Master Kai lacks the strength to defend himself — how can he withstand the impending peril? The Dong Family is allied by marriage with Fourth Master Yang, and you are kin to Master Kai. If he is in trouble, we must help without hesitation.”

That young man was none other than Dong Qinghan of the Dong Family, while the two elders were the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians who had always followed him.

Dong Qinghan shook his head. “Heavens only know what that worthless brat is up to. I heard his two Blood Servants are gravely injured and cannot exert their strength. I wanted to rush to his aid at once, but since he said so, I can only wait.”

Feng Wei nodded lightly. “The Blood Servants of the Yang Family are all formidable. Master Kai’s two Blood Servants have clashed with us before, so we know well their power!”

Suddenly interested, Dong Qinghan asked with a smile, “What would happen if you fought them in a life-or-death battle?”

The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians grew serious. “Our Realms are one stage lower than theirs. When they were at peak strength, just one of them using the Blood Fury Technique could effortlessly kill us. But now... we are confident we can easily defeat them.”

Dong Qinghan sucked in a breath, his face pale with shock. He nodded. “The Yang Family truly has their tricks. This Blood Fury Technique is extraordinary — who would dare challenge its edge?”

Feng Wei said solemnly, “The Blood Fury Technique is indeed powerful, but it drains one’s lifespan to fuel combat power. That is why the Blood Servants of the Yang Family rarely live long. It is a sorrow for all the experts of the Blood Servants Hall.”

Yun Wei nodded in full agreement.

“Enough of that for now. Since that brat told me not to interfere, he must have plans. Let’s wait for a day, and then visit his residence to learn the truth.” Dong Qinghan appeared casual and showed no concern over whether Yang Kai could survive through tonight.

The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians marveled quietly, curious what Master Kai had conveyed to their young master to make him so confident.

In another tavern, on the third floor.

A young man of about twenty-three or twenty-four years old, handsome and elegant, was also enjoying wine and food. Unlike Dong Qinghan’s frustrated demeanor, this young man was smiling cheerfully, as if all was going well.

“Young Master, the Elder instructed us to send some things to Yang Kai to settle matters peacefully. Since he has arrived in War City, shall we visit him now?” one of his accompanying protectors proposed softly.

The young man laughed. “Why go? Haven’t you heard from the tavern? Yang Kai is probably going to be eliminated tonight. The gifts I brought from the Lü Family may not be priceless, but they are no mere trinkets. If I send them now, he won’t be able to make use of them. It would be like throwing meat to a dog—no effect at all.”

“So you mean...” The protector hesitated but asked.

This young man was Lü Song, the heir to the Lü Family’s next head and son of Lü Liang. This time, following Lü Liang’s orders, he came to Zhongdu with many gifts to smooth over the incident when Yang Kai was ambushed after leaving the Lü Family.

Though the ambush was unrelated to the Lü Family, and later news spread that several Yang Family heirs had been assassinated on their return, Lü Liang had to swallow his pride; after all, Yang Kai had rested in their home for several days.

An unforeseen disaster is just an unforeseen disaster! Every noble family has its troubles.

After Qiu Yimeng’s message, Lü Liang ordered his son to depart immediately for Zhongdu to offer apology.

Lü Song snorted coldly, “That Yang Kai is pushing his luck! Just because he passed through the Lü Family and then was ambushed, he’s trying to extort our wealth! How can our Lü Family be taken advantage of by such a scoundrel?”

“You are right, Young Master,” the protector joined in indignantly. “This Yang Family heir is truly despicable. Worse still, he even sent Miss Qiu to send a message to our Lü Family, blatantly extorting money. It’s shameful.”

“Exactly. I won’t send him anything. He’s just a grasshopper after the autumn harvest, hopping around—he won’t last a few hours. Heh, we’ll just enjoy the show tonight.” Lü Song smiled smugly. “Once he falls, I won’t need to apologize.”

The protector frowned and said softly, “But Young Master, before leaving, the Elder did say that regardless of Master Kai’s performance in the succession war, these gifts must be delivered to him.”

Lü Liang knew his son had short-sightedness, so he repeatedly instructed the protectors to supervise closely.

Lü Song frowned, perplexed.

Unbeknownst to him, as news of Yang Kai’s ambush reached the Lü Family, Lü Si, the family’s top figure, had also just returned from Hidden Cloud Peak.
