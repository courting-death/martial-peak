## Chapter 92 — Confrontation

The commotion caused by the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower was deafening, their uproar echoing far into the night. The agonized screams of a Body Tempering Realm warrior as he died were especially harrowing, carrying through the darkness like a chilling lament.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang heard it clearly. Both their expressions shifted abruptly as they turned their heads toward the source of the noise.

They had no idea that so many enemies had been trailing them all this time. Wen Feichen’s tracking skills were exceptional, and he kept a safe distance, ensuring they would not be discovered. Although Xia Ningshang had reached the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, she could not detect disturbances from so far away. It was a case of deliberate ignorance, allowing Wen Feichen’s plan to proceed without a hitch.

“How could others have come here?” Xia Ningshang’s delicate brows furrowed, confusion evident in her voice.

Yang Kai’s face darkened. According to his junior senior sister, this place was merely an ordinary valley in normal times. Only on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month did a celestial anomaly occur here, an event that normally attracted no attention.

In other words, those approaching from nearby either happened to be in the vicinity at this precise moment and were drawn by the changes, or they had been following them all along with a premeditated plan.

The latter was far more likely! The number of intruders was considerable, and someone had even fallen to their death after jumping down!

This was deep within Black Wind Mountain. If these people were merely here to gather herbs or hunt beasts, they would never bring along such low-level fighters, nor would they act in such large numbers.

“This might be trouble!” Yang Kai’s mind raced as he sensed the danger. “We should retreat for now!”

“Agreed!” Xia Ningshang nodded obediently.

“Trying to leave?” A cold shout suddenly came from behind them. A figure appeared abruptly some ten or so zhang away, releasing a palm strike that cut through the air, blocking Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang’s path.

Both were startled by the attacker’s formidable strength. They leapt back to evade, quietly activating their Primordial Qi in readiness.

Yang Kai had no intention of revealing his hand before understanding the intruder’s true purpose.

Wen Feichen had arrived first and intercepted Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang. Seeing they were compliant, he refrained from attacking, merely observing silently.

Yang Kai did not catch Wen Feichen’s attention, but Xia Ningshang, her face partially concealed, caught his eye. He thought to himself, what a delicate and pure young lady. Though her features were obscured, her eyes shone with a clarity like stars—eyes no ordinary woman could possess. Moreover, her figure was truly outstanding.

Even Wen Feichen, who was not easily swayed by beauty, felt a stirring in his heart. Had it been Long Hui in his place, he might have revealed an even more shameless side.

The three stood locked in a tense standoff for some time. Yang Kai searched for an escape but found the middle-aged man before him possessed extraordinary power, standing as an immovable barrier blocking all retreat.

“This man is a True Essence Realm expert. Junior Brother, do not act rashly,” Xia Ningshang whispered, reading his thoughts.

True Essence Realm! Yang Kai inhaled deeply, suppressing the urge to act impulsively.

After a while, the rest of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower arrived, spreading out around Wen Feichen with hostile expressions fixed on Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang.

“Who are you people?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing them closely. None were familiar to him, and suspicion filled his heart as he spoke.

What he did not know was that among these people, there had originally been a few he recognized. However, their strength was too low, and they had been devoured by beasts along the way. The only survivor had died from the fall just moments ago.

“Those who want your life!” Long Hui stepped out from behind Wen Feichen, sneering coldly. When his gaze fell upon Xia Ningshang, his eyes gleamed with a greenish light as he shamelessly scanned her body, praising aloud, “Wonderful, wonderful! Such a pure and charming woman—this young master’s journey is truly worthwhile!”

Xia Ningshang’s brows knitted in disgust. She quietly slipped behind Yang Kai, seeking refuge. Though her cultivation far surpassed his, she was still an innocent girl unfamiliar with the world. Hiding like this brought her no shame; rather, it felt entirely natural.

The two were already close, and with her standing so near, Yang Kai felt the soft pressure behind him. He involuntarily drew a breath, straightening his posture.

Despite the crisis, Yang Kai remained composed, his mind calm. After a moment’s thought, he asked, “Do you bear enmity against us?”

Now he was certain these people had not come by chance. Their hostility was deliberate from the start.

Were these enemies provoked by Shopkeeper Meng and his apprentice, or by himself? Yang Kai needed to find out. Even if death awaited, he would face it with clarity.

“Of course there is enmity!” Long Hui, confident of victory, revealed his identity without hesitation. “Boy, I am Long Hui, grandson of Long Zaitian, the Vice Leader of the Blood Battle Gang! You dared to set your sights on Hu Mei’er—did you ever imagine this day would come?”

Yang Kai was stunned. He had never expected trouble to come from such a person. The reason for their grudge was utterly baseless. He had met Hu Mei’er only three times, with little interaction. To be treated as a rival for her affections was absurd. Apart from lamenting the fickleness of petty people, what else could he say?

Mentioning Long Zaitian reminded Yang Kai of the elder he had encountered in the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area. The humiliation Long Zaitian had inflicted upon him then was unforgettable.

After Long Hui finished, Nu Lang spoke with a grim tone, “Nu Tao is my younger brother! He disappeared along with Cheng Shaofeng. Boy, tell me, do you know anything about their disappearance?”

Two groups had come to cause trouble at once! Yang Kai finally understood the situation.

He sighed inwardly at his own boldness. This was his first time venturing far from the sect, and already two waves of enemies had targeted him, mobilizing such a large force.

This time, he had even dragged Xia Ningshang into the fray.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai’s face showed no fear, his expression calm as he gently squeezed Xia Ningshang’s fingers and whispered, “Don’t worry about me later. Find a chance to escape on your own.”

Since he had caused this trouble, he would not let Xia Ningshang suffer alongside him. If she fled alone, she might still have a chance. Staying with him would only be a burden.

Though his voice was soft, those opposite heard it clearly.

Long Hui laughed heartily. “Trying to leave? It’s not that easy. This young master has suffered in these mountains and forests alongside you for so many days. How could I not have my reward? Yang Kai, today you will surely die. As for that little woman behind you, she will become my plaything! Don’t worry, I won’t kill her right away. Only when I tire of her will I let her die!”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. He roared, “Leave!”

At the same time, he reached back and grabbed Xia Ningshang’s arm. To her surprise, he flung her with all his strength.

“Foolish delusions!” Wen Feichen sneered coldly. His figure flickered as he suddenly appeared behind Xia Ningshang, delivering a palm strike to her back.
