## Chapter 2393 — The Vigor of Youth

“Since you’re already here, why are you in such a hurry to leave?” Yang Kai said with a light smile, but there wasn’t a trace of warmth in his eyes—only a chilling coldness.

How many years had it been? It had been so many years since anyone dared to try to seize his body. The last Divine Soul that tried this had long since been blasted to pieces.

A beam of light slashed across his Sea of Consciousness, surging with murderous intent, and swept straight toward the Yin-Soul.

“Divine Soul Imperial Treasure!” Sensing the terrifying power of the Soul-Severing Blade, the Yin-Soul shouted in terror, hesitating no longer. He opened his mouth and spat out a murky black light to meet the Soul-Severing Blade.

No one knew what that murky light was, but when it collided with the Soul-Severing Blade, it instantly slowed the blade considerably.

The blade’s light slashed down, and the Yin-Soul let out a miserable scream. Though gravely wounded, he managed to cling to life, seizing the chance to tear open Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness defenses and escape in a single burst.

Yang Kai frowned. He hadn’t expected this Yin-Soul to have such a trick up his sleeve. Still, after taking a blow from the Soul-Severing Blade, he certainly wouldn’t be well off. Even if he didn’t die, he likely wouldn’t live much longer.

In the stone cave, Yang Kai opened his eyes again, and immediately the wailing of the Yin-Soul rang in his ears, clearly in great pain.

Looking over, he saw the Yin-Soul curled up in a corner. The once-solid body was now dim and flickering, as if it could collapse at any moment.

Sangde stared in shock, his face full of astonishment.

After a long while, he finally shouted in a low voice, “Old ghost, what happened?!”

The Yin-Soul was so gravely wounded that he didn’t even hear him, let alone have the energy to answer.

Yang Kai let out a cold laugh and patted the dust from his clothes as he stood up, looking completely unbothered. “I tried to warn you, but you wouldn’t listen. Some people just have to suffer a little before they learn their lesson.”

Sangde staggered back several steps, staring at Yang Kai as if he’d seen a ghost. “You… how is it possible…?”

Yang Kai was clearly injured and poisoned, so how had he suddenly become so lively? The string of events before his eyes left Sangde increasingly unsettled.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “Master, you’re quite the schemer. You went to all this trouble to bring us here just so your master could devour and seize our bodies. Such filial piety is truly as deep as the sea—it’s enough to move one to tears!”

Sangde’s expression shifted uncertainly. “You were prepared all along!”

Yang Kai said in a deep voice, “Not just me. Shen Fei and Snake Lady were also prepared, but so what? Didn’t we all still fall into your hands?”

“Why are you unharmed?!”

Yang Kai curled his lip disdainfully. “You think someone like you could ever see through my abilities? With your petty tricks, you actually thought you could scheme against me?”

Sangde’s face flushed red, then blue, unsure whether from anger or embarrassment. But whatever he felt, it was pointless to argue now—Yang Kai was clearly unharmed, and not only that, even the old ghost who’d tried to seize his body in the Sea of Consciousness seemed to have suffered a heavy blow.

“Save… save…” Over there, the Yin-Soul cried out hoarsely, his body’s light flickering as if he would dissipate at any moment.

The Soul-Severing Blade was an Imperial Treasure, and not just any Imperial Treasure, but a Divine Soul Imperial Treasure! The Yin-Soul was only a Spirit Body, so surviving that blow was already lucky.

Sangde’s face changed dramatically when he heard this, and he hurriedly looked toward the Yin-Soul. But in this situation, he was clearly powerless, and a look of deep pain appeared on his face.

“Release… release your Sea of Consciousness defenses!” the Yin-Soul continued to howl. From his words, it seemed he wanted Sangde to lower his defenses so he could enter Sangde’s Sea of Consciousness and hide for a while.

But how could Sangde agree to such a thing? He acted as if he hadn’t heard, standing there with a grim face, unmoving.

“Traitorous disciple!” the Yin-Soul roared unwillingly. Suddenly, his illusory body burst into a dazzling light and shattered, turning into countless motes of light that disappeared.

“Such a touching bond between master and disciple… tsk tsk…” Yang Kai watched the spectacle from the side, clicking his tongue.

“You killed him!” Sangde turned, glaring at Yang Kai with a dark expression.

“So what?” Yang Kai sneered. “Now it’s just you and me, Sangde. Let’s be frank. If you want to live, tell me where the exit is and I’ll spare you. Otherwise…” Yang Kai grinned menacingly, “I’ll make you wish you were dead!”

“You want me to tell you the exit’s location?” Sangde’s face twisted with a strange expression.

Yang Kai frowned, suddenly feeling something was off.

Sangde suddenly burst into manic laughter. “You killed the old ghost, and now you want me to tell you the exit’s location?”

Yang Kai said, “It’s not like you two were close enough to avenge each other. In fact, it seemed like you had a deep grudge. What’s the problem with me killing him? Sangde, don’t be stubborn. Cooperating with me is the only sensible choice!”

“Only the old ghost knew the exit’s location! You killed him—where am I supposed to get it from?!” Sangde suddenly screamed hysterically, veins bulging on his forehead.

Yang Kai was stunned, and after a long moment, he anxiously asked, “What do you mean?”

Sangde sneered, “The Bihai Shuttle is right here. With my skills, I could take it any time. But why would I go to all this trouble to bring you here, plot against you, and let the old ghost seize a new body? That old ghost’s body was destroyed by me years ago, yet I still went to such lengths to save him. Do you know why?”

Yang Kai suddenly recalled the deal Sangde had mentioned earlier, and his face changed. “Don’t tell me…”

Sangde snorted, “I help him seize a new body, and he gives me the exit’s location. That was the deal!”

Yang Kai’s heart instantly sank to the bottom. After a long silence, he cursed, “You old dog, what nonsense! Why didn’t you say something so important earlier?!”

If he’d known this, Yang Kai would never have used the Soul-Severing Blade on the Yin-Soul. Now it was too late—the Yin-Soul was destroyed, the exit’s location vanished with him, and the Bihai Shuttle was useless. This was a complete farce.

“Who are you to me? Why should I tell you any of this?” Sangde sneered, looking at Yang Kai with mockery.

Yang Kai said, “Earlier you said there were three people who knew the exit’s location. Was that also a lie?”

“Does it really matter that much? Do you even know who the Masters of Ice Heart Pavilion and Tongtian Island are? Do you actually have the guts to approach them for a deal? Be careful, or they’ll swallow you whole—bones and all!” Sangde sneered coldly, then flicked his sleeve and said, “Things have come to this—let’s go our separate ways. From now on, you walk your own path, and I’ll walk mine. We’ll have nothing more to do with each other!”

With that, he turned to leave.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, sending a wave of pressure toward Sangde. Sangde froze, turning to look at Yang Kai. “What, you want to finish me off too?”

“You started it, I’m just finishing it. Seems fair to me!”

“Young people these days are so arrogant. Do you really think you can kill me?” Sangde, already full of anger, exploded at Yang Kai’s relentless pursuit.

After all, he was a peak expert at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. At this level, he didn’t need to fear anyone. If pushed, he wouldn’t mind teaching Yang Kai a lesson.

“Old geezers these days don’t know their place. They think age is an advantage and always try to pull rank. It’s laughable!” Yang Kai retorted.

Sangde’s face darkened, his expression extremely grim. “Boy, have you never heard the saying, ‘the older the ginger, the spicier it gets’? Are you really set on making an enemy of me?”

Yang Kai snorted, then waved his hand, releasing Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi. Liu Yan was still riding the White Tiger, her petite figure sitting atop it, looking imposing.

Yang Kai pointed at Sangde and laughed, “Come, come—let this old man witness the vigor of us young people!”

Hua Qingsi shot Yang Kai a glare, thinking, “Sister Hua is no spring chicken—when did I become a young person?”

“What the hell are those things?” Sangde exclaimed in shock. He hadn’t seen how Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi appeared; it was as if Yang Kai had simply waved his hand and they’d materialized out of nowhere.

Had they been hiding and following all along? But why hadn’t he noticed a thing?

Releasing his Divine Sense, Sangde’s heart instantly turned cold. He discovered that both the little girl and the beautiful woman possessed the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and the White Tiger the girl rode radiated a strange, dangerous aura.

“Master, should I kill or spare him?” Liu Yan suddenly asked calmly.

“Kill him!” Yang Kai snorted. Since Sangde didn’t know the exit’s location, there was no reason to keep him around.

“Wait!” Sangde cried out in alarm.

But before he could finish, Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi had already flanked him from both sides. Seeing this, Sangde’s face changed drastically, and he immediately turned to flee.

The White Tiger opened its mouth and unleashed a pillar of pure white energy, brimming with world-destroying power, which narrowly missed Sangde as it blasted into empty space.

Sangde was scared out of his wits. Though that attack hadn’t hit him, he sensed the power of the Emperor Realm behind it. That White Tiger was actually an Emperor Realm being? Realizing this, he dared not linger for even a moment and just wanted to escape as quickly as possible.

The three of them chased and fled, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Only then did Yang Kai snort coldly and turn his gaze to the Bihai Shuttle.

Although he’d accidentally killed the Yin-Soul before figuring things out, the Bihai Shuttle was still the key to leaving. Now that it was right in front of him, Yang Kai naturally wouldn’t let it go.

He leapt onto the Bihai Shuttle, sat cross-legged, and began refining it.

A few days ago, Yang Kai had refined a multi-deck ship, which had only taken a day. But refining this Bihai Shuttle took a full seven days. The more he refined it, the more he realized how complex its construction was.

Sangde had said that his master spent his entire life forging this Secret Treasure, and it didn’t seem like a lie. For a Secret Treasure that took so much time and effort, an artificer would be lucky to make even one in a lifetime.
