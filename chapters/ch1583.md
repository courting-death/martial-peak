## Chapter 1583 — A Shameful Humiliation

“That boy Xue Lian’s Jiao Transformation has already reached perfection,” Chi Yue murmured softly within her bedchamber, focusing even more intently on the commotion coming from the distant pavilion.

As one of the ten lords, she certainly wouldn't, like Shan Qingluo or Yu Xiong, go charging out to watch the duel in person—doing so would be beneath her station—yet with her powerful Divine Sense she could spy from the shadows without fear of being detected.

To be honest, Yang Kai's duel with Xue Lian had truly opened her eyes.

Who was Xue Lian? He was the son of the Lord of the Blood Jiao, the heir painstakingly trained by that lord, the future master of the Blood Jiao lineage; to think that a warrior of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm with such strong cultivation could not defeat Yang Kai.

If Yang Kai could only match an ordinary Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm opponent blow for blow, that alone would mark him as a heaven-born prodigy—but his adversary was Xue Lian.

She had never imagined that Yang Kai, a human, could, in a contest of raw physical power, force Xue Lian to unleash the Jiao Transformation.

Even among the yao, experts capable of doing that were rare.

Yet Yang Kai had done it—as a human!

Such a thing had never occurred on Di Chen Star; human warriors there were suppressed by the yao, cultivation resources were scarce, even Origin Returning Realm practitioners were extremely rare, let alone anyone who could square off against the son of the Blood Jiao Lord!

Chi Yue's face registered shock; she secretly chided herself for having underestimated Yang Kai and failing to see his true might.

It’s just… I wonder how deep his attainments are in other domains. If his overall strength truly isn’t weak, then he might indeed be worthy of Shan Qingluo—when the time comes, helping bring this union to fruition wouldn’t be a bad thing either.

In this way, not only would Shan Qingluo be able to settle her heart, but she would also gain a powerful ally — achieving two goals with a single move.

After what happened with Ba He two hundred years ago, Chi Yue no longer dared oppose such matters outright; she feared offending Shan Qingluo, feared seeing her repeat Ba He's fate.

"I hope you will not disappoint me!"

Thinking that, Chi Yue hid her Divine Sense around the battlefield and watched the commotion there.

Outside the loft, Yang Kai frowned, his expression strange as he stared at Xue Lian.

Xue Lian now appeared hideous and terrifying; his exposed skin was covered in patches of blood-red scales, his whole body steamed with red light. His bloodlust soared as he took in the oddity on Yang Kai's face and laughed heartily: "Human, you're not frightened, are you? If you are, it's not too late to beg for mercy!"

"You only know how to boast?" Yang Kai sneered, the oddness on his face deepening.

The moment Xue Lian unleashed the Jiao Transformation, Yang Kai felt a force within him stir, as if something wanted to burst forth from his body that he could not fully control.

This surprised him greatly.

After working out what that force was, he relaxed.

Yang Kai did not let that mysterious power erupt; instead he suppressed it and suddenly a five-colored radiance suffused him, the light seeming to possess a spirit as it wound and twined about his body, constantly shifting.

Yang Kai's already formidable aura surged in an instant!

"What is that?" Ba He cried in astonishment, craning his neck to look at Yang Kai.

"Damn, he didn't use his full strength—this guy is terrifying!" Yu Xiong's eyes nearly popped, his face disbelief incarnate.

Mi Tian, watching from afar, was equally stunned; he had expected that once Xue Lian used the Jiao Transformation Yang Kai would be doomed, yet in a blink Yang Kai had employed a wondrous secret art to bolster his own strength.

A human secret art… truly profound! Mi Tian's spirits lifted as he stared unblinkingly at Yang Kai, intent on discovering the use of that five-colored light.

The five-colored radiance was distinct in hue—yellow, cyan, white, red, gold—intertwining and entangling, each emitting a different aura. Yet the five airs fused perfectly, without the slightest discord.

Undying Five Elements Sword qi!

Yang Kai's high skill in physical strength came partly from a strong foundation and partly from having taken massive amounts of Life Jade Nectar, forging much pure Golden Blood and filling his Qi and blood with vigor.

Cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword had further elevated his corporeal strength by another notch.

It was an exceedingly wondrous body-tempering cultivation method.

When Yang Kai cultivated it he had selected Five-Element treasures of an extremely high grade, so the results were naturally significant.

Now the Undying Five Elements Sword had reached a minor completion and could be used against an enemy!

Seeing Yang Kai enveloped in five-colored light, Xue Lian paused, then quickly sneered: "Very well, human, it seems you have drawn from your deepest art—let us see which of us is stronger!"

With those words he transformed into a streak of blood-red light and shot toward Yang Kai.

The red light resembled a cloud of blood that leapt over Yang Kai's head, splitting a great maw as it descended to engulf him; the surrounding blood mist exuded an extremely evil and violent aura, tugging at the deepest, most brutal parts of Yang Kai's heart and turning his eyes blood-red.

Yang Kai roared. The five-colored radiance flared and formed five layers of energy armor about him. Golden light surged onto his fists, and in an instant his fists seemed to be covered with countless tiny golden needles as he unleashed a furious barrage at the blood cloud.

Among the Undying Five Elements Sword qi, metal was sharpest and most lethal, earth excelled at defense; the five elements complemented each other's strengths and weaknesses to perfection.

Xue Lian's dense layer of blood-red scales looked exceptionally sturdy; naturally Yang Kai used the metal-attributed Undying sword qi to strike.

All the experts watching openly and in secret held their breath at that moment, wanting to know who, with the aid of secret arts, would prove superior between Yang Kai and Xue Lian.

The result astonished everyone!

There was neither a prolonged, anxious struggle nor the long stalemate from before; this time, after their collision, Xue Lian immediately began to suffer.

From within that bloodlight came Xue Lian's cries and roars of alarm, while Yang Kai fell silent—yet everyone could sense he was launching a fierce, merciless assault.

Blood spurted, and fragments like scales fell away—the scales from Xue Lian's body.

Ba He's eyeballs trembled.

Only now did he finally realize that Yang Kai's attainment in physical strength had surpassed that of the hardy, ferocious Blood Jiao lineage; he had been completely mistaken before.

He instinctively put himself in Xue Lian's shoes and considered how, were he Xue Lian, he could break free of the present crisis.

The conclusion drained the color from his face.

Helpless! Utterly and truly helpless!

The true strength of this Second Stage human already in no way lagged behind any Third Stage; he was even fiercer than most of the Third Stage! Even if Ba He himself descended to fight him one-on-one, the outcome would likely be grim.

Cold sweat beaded on Ba He's brow; his mind went blank—he was utterly stunned, not knowing Yang Kai's origins.

Such a prodigy, he thought, could hardly be found a second time across the entire Star Domain!

"Little Sister, which Cultivation Star do you suppose my brother-in-law comes from?" Yu Xiong asked dazedly.

"A very backward, low-ranked star," Shan Qingluo said, pursing her lips to smile. "Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand."

A low-ranked star… Yu Xiong felt his thoughts fail him.

A human from a low-ranked star could perform so? His ferocity would drive all those in the Star Domain who considered themselves geniuses to despair and even to suicide.

"Well, now you can report back to your foster mother, can't you? She will surely be pleased with such a result." Shan Qingluo glanced at Yu Xiong, her smile capable of overturning hearts.

"Absolutely…" Yu Xiong nodded heavily; if such a human could not satisfy their foster mother, then no one could.

Through this battle, his so-called brother-in-law had already proven his strength to everyone.

Shan Qingluo fell silent, dazzled, her gaze drawn downward as she sank into admiration for Yang Kai's dominance.

Once she was certain Yang Kai had the upper hand, she no longer worried for him and instead began to take pleasure in the fight.

A miserable cry rang out; Xue Lian pulled back, his eyes full of horror as he trembled and stared at Yang Kai.

His breath had withered; countless blood-red scales fell from him, and even the two curved horns on his brow seemed to have dulled, no longer emitting the dazzling sheen they once did.

A great shame!

To be forced into such a state by a human a Stage below him—this was a stain on his life!

He could not accept such a result.

On Di Chen he, Xue Lian, was renowned and feared no warrior below the Void King Realm; not even Mi Tian had been held in his regard—yet this human of unclear origin had dealt him a heavy blow and humiliated his bloodline.

How could he accept that? How would he calmly let it go?

"Human, you have forced my hand!" Xue Lian roared; after saying this a resolute expression crossed his face and he opened his mouth to spit out a blood-red orb.

The orb was the size of an infant's fist and contained terrifying power; within it something like a small serpent writhed—the Blood Bead.

"Xue Lian has gone mad!" Yu Xiong cried in alarm. "He actually spat out his Inner Core."

"Bad—Xue Lian is going all out." Ba He also showed a flash of horror and shouted, "Stop him!"

Saying so, he hurried toward the battlefield.

Shan Qingluo seemed to come to her senses as well; she replied once and then followed hard on Ba He's heels.

Whether a yao expert had taken a demonic beast form and then become human or was born as a human, inside them was the special thing called the Inner Core; the Inner Core was a yao's most precious treasure, the vessel of their life.

A yao warrior would never use the Inner Core in battle unless in the most desperate circumstances, for once it was damaged the consequences would be dire.
