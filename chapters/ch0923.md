## Chapter 923 — Too Enthusiastic

Two months later, on a certain day, Yang Kai returned from his trips.

Back at the Saint Lord's garden, he summoned Xu Hui and asked whether the disciples had turned up any news about Zhongdu during that time, but there was nothing.

Yang Kai couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.

Two months earlier he had pulled every string he could, asking several powers to keep an eye on reports from Zhongdu, and the Nine Heavens Sacred Land itself was also making inquiries, yet they still came up empty.

Over these two months he had personally been searching everywhere for entrances to the Small Xuan Realms.

He had gone in and out of fully twenty or thirty Small Xuan Realms, but not a single one led to Zhongdu.

The Flying Shuttle's incredible speed was a huge help; in two months' time Yang Kai had nearly covered half of the human territories.

Every three days he returned to the Sacred Land, just in case any useful intelligence turned up.

Yet he had not received a single lead.

Xu Hui had already withdrawn when a wisp of fragrant breeze drifted over. Yang Kai lifted his eyes and saw Xia Ningshang standing before him, draped in light gauze, her figure graceful and supple. As if sensing the restlessness in Yang Kai’s heart, a look of shared understanding welled up in her beautiful eyes.

Yang Kai reached out and pulled her; to the Little Senior Sister's startled cry he drew her down into his arms and asked, "Are the pills finished?"

"Mm." Xia Ningshang nodded gently. "Thanks to the recent Small Xuan Realm situation, fewer people have been coming here to request pills, so there aren't many prescriptions to prepare now."

With so many Small Xuan Realms suddenly appearing, most martial artists went off to try their luck, leaving the Nine Peaks to seek opportunities elsewhere, so now those who come for pills outside the Nine Peaks no longer need to queue.

That also left Xia Ningshang and the other masters with more free time.

The senior sister and junior brother sat close, skin to skin, breathing in each other's scent, their hearts serene.

"Junior Brother, you're trying to find the passage back to Zhongdu, aren't you?" Xia Ningshang suddenly asked.

"Did you ask the Great Elder?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

Xia Ningshang shook her head. "I could tell myself. Strictly speaking Zhongdu is also a Small Xuan Realm; before there was no entrance to be found, but now the entrance opened on its own and should have been discovered already — yet no news has come out. You must be worried. You've been going out a lot lately, so I guessed it."

"Yes, I'm looking, but unfortunately I haven't found it."

“There will be clues sooner or later, Junior Brother, don’t worry.” Xia Ningshang soothed him gently, taking Yang Kai’s large hand in her own as she sighed softly. “At such a critical time, I don’t even know where Master has gone. If he were here, at least there’d be someone to consult.”

"Shopkeeper Meng… he might have urgent business to attend to," Yang Kai said, though he wasn't clear on why Shopkeeper Meng had gone at such a critical moment.

But since he left the Nine Heavens Sacred Land the moment he arrived, even entrusting Xia Ningshang to Yang Kai's care, it must be important.

Yang Kai even suspected he had gone to the Demon Domain.

After all, he had suffered a heavy defeat under the Demon Lord back then; now that he had regained strength, he might have gone looking to pick a fight with the Demon Lord again.

If that were true, Shopkeeper Meng's prospects looked grim.

Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded from outside.

Startled like a rabbit, Xia Ningshang sprang from Yang Kai's embrace, cheeks flushed with embarrassment, and awkwardly stepped aside.

When no one was around she could be affectionate with Yang Kai, but in front of others she could not let herself go.

The newcomer was Xu Hui, looking hurried and flustered.

Yang Kai stared at him in surprise. "Great Elder, is there something else?"

Xu Hui had only just reported what the disciples had learned during this time and left, but soon returned in a rush. It was clear he had urgent news.

"Saint Lord, two women have arrived outside and explicitly requested to see you," Xu Hui reported carefully, glancing at Xia Ningshang's expression as he spoke.

"Women?" Yang Kai frowned. "What kind of women?"

"Uh… very pretty, and very young." Xu Hui looked straight ahead and reported matter-of-factly, sounding as if he assumed these two women were love entanglements Yang Kai had stirred up while away and had come to collect their due.

Xia Ningshang thought the same and pursed her lips into a slight smile, her eyes lingering on Yang Kai as she murmured, "Junior Brother, I'll go back to my room first."

Yang Kai twitched at the corner of his mouth and, adopting an air of righteous indignation, said, "I didn't meet any pretty young women out there… Could they be Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu of the Duao Alliance? The Great Elder met them the last time they came to the Sacred Land."

"Not them." Xu Hui shook his head, then brightened. "Actually, the two girls appear to be twins — their faces are similar, but their temperaments differ; one is seductive, the other sprightly… yes, both are rare beauties."

He spoke as if Yang Kai was very fortunate, clearly convinced the visitors had some amorous connection to him.

Yang Kai's expression changed abruptly; he sprang to his feet and barked, "Twins?"

"Yes." Xu Hui, puzzled by Yang Kai's strong reaction, looked at him in astonishment and continued, "And from my observation these two young ladies seem to have trained some special method. Their life auras are virtually identical, even the ripples of power emitted from their bodies are exactly the same. Their strength is roughly at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm, but they give an unignorable impression — it's odd. Even if they're twins, there shouldn't be no difference between their life auras and power ripples."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened and glowed with divine light; Xia Ningshang halted, covering her mouth, surprise and delight shining in her gaze.

The senior sister and junior brother exchanged a glance and both thought of the same possibility.

"Where are they?" Yang Kai hurriedly asked, releasing his divine sense.

"Just outside the peak."

"Take me to them!"

"I'll go too!" Xia Ningshang cried.

"Uh…" Xu Hui stood dumbfounded, frozen in place, secretly worried for Yang Kai. He wondered whether his Saint Lord's senior sister intended to give those two women a hard time.

But judging by her demeanor, she didn't seem the type.

"What are you dawdling for?" Yang Kai snapped, and he and Xia Ningshang shot out toward the peak.

Xu Hui steeled himself and followed, secretly resolving that if the women started a fight he'd be the first to make himself scarce and let the Saint Lord deal with the headache.

Such romantic blessings are not always blessings.

As someone who'd been around, Xu Hui knew how terrifying a woman could be once she started causing a scene.

Outside the Nine Peaks, two graceful women stood quietly. Both were of peerless beauty—bosoms full, waists slender and lithe—yet their temperaments differed: the one on the left exuded enchantment, while the one on the right seemed more sprightly. Standing together, they gave off a soul-stirring, breathtaking impact on the eyes.

Several Sacred Land disciples guarding the area kept sneaking glances at them, secretly stunned.

They dared not stare too blatantly, only stealing looks when the women were unobservant, then savoring the sight in their minds, thoroughly satisfied.

"Sister, these people are disgusting, always peeking," the woman on the right murmured into her elder sister's ear, lips barely touching.

"Ignore them." The left sister shook her head and laughed coquettishly. "Are they not allowed to take a look? It's not like they'll lose any flesh. Men are all the same; there are far worse people than them."

“But that person was different…”

“That person…” The elder sister’s expression grew much more solemn, a look of reminiscence crossing her face. “That person left more than ten years ago and has been without any word ever since. I don’t even know if the one here is really him.”

"I think it's him!"

The elder glanced at her sister and scoffed, "Although I hope so, it seems unlikely. They say the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land has reached the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm. We only obtained the supreme inheritance, which is why we have our current cultivation. Even if he were powerful, he couldn't possibly have advanced faster than we have. When the two of us trained together our progress was twice that of ordinary people."

"Have you forgotten the miracles he worked back in Zhongdu and War City? What was impossible for others became possible for him."

"I hope so, but if it really is him, how could he have become the master of this place in just ten years? Such a force can't be compared to the Eight Great Families." The elder sighed; though a little hopeful, she still felt it unlikely.

"And we don't know how things are back at our Sect…" the younger sister said anxiously.

"No matter what happens there, we can't go back now. Our only hope is to find him and get him to help… Ah, someone's coming." The elder lifted her head and looked to the distance, spotting three figures rushing toward them.

The three moved so fast that even at the elder's cultivation level she only saw afterimages.

When the trio arrived and dropped down before them, the sisters' eyes brightened. They looked disbelieving and then, as if relieved, fixed their gazes ahead.

"Disciple greets the Saint Lord and the Great Elder!" The Sacred Land disciples on guard bowed respectfully. The Great Elder waved his hand without speaking, standing behind Yang Kai and watching the scene.

He noticed that when Yang Kai saw the two young women he smiled — silently but heartily, as if reunited with old acquaintances after a long absence.

"It's really you!" Xia Ningshang covered her mouth and cried out.

"Yang Kai!" The sisters, overly excited, called his name in unison and, to the Great Elder's astonishment, both leapt forward and gave Yang Kai a solid embrace.

Their movements were so perfectly synchronized they seemed like one person!

Left and right they pressed against him, soft bodies folding into his arms, the elasticity at their chests remarkable. Yang Kai stood flustered and helpless, clearly stunned.

Too enthusiastic!

Ten years apart and the two sisters had become so forward, throwing themselves into his arms; Yang Kai was overwhelmed.

Xia Ningshang stood to one side and laughed lightly, showing no sign of displeasure.

The Great Elder looked up to the sky, his expression focused as if some great mystery hung there.
