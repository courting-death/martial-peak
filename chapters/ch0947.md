## Chapter 947 — Placement

The Hu Family sisters’ true intentions, of course, did not escape Yang Kai.

And Yang Kai had long since made his own plans.

Sun Yu was being treated like a treasure simply because Chen Zhou and the others mistakenly believed he had awakened the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance. If the Hu sisters went to the Twin Pavilion carrying the complete Consonant Spirit Technique, they would doubtless be treated no less favorably.

They would surely become rising stars of the Twin Pavilion!

After all, what they carried was the most orthodox form of the Consonant Spirit Technique, not some later patchwork assembled by the Twin Pavilion’s descendants.

More importantly, the Twin Pavilion might possess information the Hu sisters needed. Over the years the two sisters had been studying and practicing on their own; although their strength had reached the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm, on Tongxuan Continent that was hardly exceptional.

The people in the Twin Pavilion had clearly conducted deeper research into the Consonant Spirit Technique and could teach them much—it would be far more beneficial than solitary cultivation.

“Yang Kai, we’d like to—” Hu Jiao’er faltered as she looked at Yang Kai, but he cut her off with an outstretched hand.

“Palace Master Chen, what are the two pavilion masters of the Twin Pavilion like as people?” Yang Kai asked seriously. He understood the Hu sisters’ wishes but wasn’t comfortable simply sending them off to the Twin Pavilion without knowing more.

“As for their character, Saint Lord Yang may rest assured. I’ve dealt with them for years; they’re upright people. The Twin Pavilion isn’t large—their disciples number, in total, only about a thousand—so they’ve always kept to themselves and not committed atrocities. Though only a thousand in number, their standing on the continent is by no means inferior to my Dragon-Phoenix Palace. Wu Fa and Wu Tian are both cultivators at the First Stage of the Saint Realm, comparable to me, yet when those two join forces they can defeat most experts at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm,” Chen Zhou explained with pleasure.

“Then there’s no problem.” Yang Kai nodded.

Chen Zhou’s eyes brightened. “If these two young ladies can bring the complete Consonant Spirit Technique to the Twin Pavilion, Wu Fa and Wu Tian will be overjoyed!”

“No rush. Jiao’er and Mei’er should first return to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land with me. We can decide once we’re there.” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Oh.” The Hu sisters obediently agreed.

“May I send word to Wu Fa and Wu Tian to inform them of this good news?” Chen Zhou asked cautiously, watching Yang Kai’s expression.

“Please do, Palace Master Chen.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Thank you.” Chen Zhou showed his gratitude and immediately summoned Elder Xiao Ling of Dragon-Phoenix Palace, instructing him to hurry to the Twin Pavilion and convey the Hu sisters’ situation to Wu Fa and Wu Tian.

The Dragon-Phoenix Palace and the Twin Pavilion had always been on friendly terms; Chen Zhou and the two Wu Elders were close. Sun Yu’s awakening of the Dragon Emperor inheritance made the Dragon Emperor’s might reappear after thousands of years. Chen Zhou was both joyful and regretful, but seeing hope in the Hu sisters he was eager to inform his two friends and quietly celebrate on their behalf.

Yang Kai stepped into the formation and walked forward shoulder to shoulder with Ling Taixu.

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er couldn’t hide their excitement. Flanking Chen Zhou on either side, they peppered him with questions about the Twin Pavilion.

Chen Zhou told them everything he knew, and the three chatted merrily.

“Saint Lord Yang has been considerate about your welfare,” Chen Zhou suddenly said with a knowing smile.

“What do you mean by that, elder?” Hu Jiao’er asked, puzzled.

Chen Zhou explained, “If Saint Lord Yang asks you both to return with him to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, and I relay this news to the Twin Pavilion, then if Wu Fa and Wu Tian want to seek you out, they must come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land! With Saint Lord Yang connected into that chain, they won’t treat you poorly later; rather, they’ll see you as the Sect’s future hope. If you went directly to the Twin Pavilion yourselves, things might be different.”

Hu Jiao’er considered this and found it sensible; her dark eyes flicked to Yang Kai and she sneered, “How cunning.”

“He’s looking out for you,” Chen Zhou nodded with a faint, ambiguous smile, as if he’d seen through something.

……

After three consecutive months of arduous travel, the thousands-strong contingent was finally approaching their destination. Word spread and spirits lifted; everyone’s faces showed eager expectation.

After such a long journey, the warriors from Great Han were weary; beyond the initial curiosity and novelty, they were desperate for a place to settle so they could fully enjoy the abundant Spiritual Qi of this land and the gifts this continent offered.

This world’s cultivation conditions were incomparably better than those back in Great Han, and each person silently looked forward to how they might grow in the future.

Nearly a hundred li from the Nine Peaks, several figures sped over from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

When they neared, they clasped their fists and saluted in unison: “Saint Lord!”

Elders of the Sacred Land mobilized without exception, their gazes roaming over the thousands with evident curiosity.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod. “Is everything prepared?”

Elder Xu Hui replied, “All set. Per Elder Shi Kun’s orders, we tidied up the old War Soul Hall site a few days ago—ready for occupation—though some sections still require repair.”

“No matter.” Yang Kai nodded, satisfied.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land already housed three thousand disciples; Yang Kai had brought four to five thousand more this time. The Nine Peaks simply couldn’t accommodate them all, and even if they were squeezed in, the concentrated numbers would strain the available Spiritual Qi.

So he had prepared housing for the masses in advance.

The old sites of Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall were excellent choices.

Those two sects had established themselves in places with abundant Spiritual Qi and beautiful scenery—ideal for long-term residence—and, crucially, the buildings were already there.

However, Poxuan Palace now had an entrance to a starry sky gateway, so Yang Kai was reluctant to quarter the Great Han people there; instead, he cramped them all into the War Soul Hall ruins.

Elder Shi Kun had left more than a month earlier to return to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and convey Yang Kai’s orders.

Everything there had since been put in order.

They were only waiting for Yang Kai’s people to arrive.

The War Soul Hall site was also conveniently located between the Sacred Land and the Netherworld Sect, meaning anyone who wanted to harm them would have to pass by either the Sacred Land or the Netherworld Sect.

The safety of the Great Han warriors was therefore strongly guaranteed.

While on the road, Yang Kai had informed everyone of the plan; Yang Zhao, Qiu Yimeng, Huo Xingchen and the other faction leaders from Great Han all expressed no objection.

Living in the War Soul Hall ruins would also make it very convenient for them to seek out Yang Kai or visit the Nine Heavens Sacred Land in the future—no more than half an hour’s travel.

As the vast column marched, Yang Kai introduced the Sacred Land’s elders and the various Great Han faction leaders to one another so they could become familiar faces.

Xu Hui and the others treated Yang Kai’s entourage with courtesy, which left some of the younger faction heads pleasantly flattered.

They knew full well that with their modest strengths, had it not been for Yang Kai’s connections, these Saint Realm experts would likely never deigned to glance their way.

Yet now, the centuries-old masters were polite to them.

For a moment a subtle exhilaration arose, and they gained a deeper appreciation for Yang Kai’s extraordinary status in this world.

“Saint Lord Yang, since we’ve arrived, we’ll take our leave now,” Chen Zhou suddenly said as he approached Yang Kai.

They had been away from Dragon-Phoenix Palace for months; it was time to return.

“Palace Master Chen, you’ve worked hard on the journey—stay at the Sacred Land a few days and let me fulfill my duty as host,” Yang Kai said earnestly. They had indeed encountered many incidents along the way.

With thousands traveling together, some foolish troublemakers arose; if not for Dragon-Phoenix Palace handling things properly, Yang Kai might have unleashed slaughter.

Chen Zhou and his people had done their utmost to escort them; now that they were at their doorstep, Yang Kai felt compelled to make a gesture.

Chen Zhou hesitated for a moment.

“Since Senior Yang invited us, we shouldn’t refuse,” Sun Yu interjected.

Chen Zhou forced a wry smile. “You child!”

He bowed and clasped his fists. “Then we’ll trouble you for a few days.”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Sun Yu slid up to Yang Kai, lowering his voice to ask, “Senior Yang, when will you reveal the truth to Palace Master? Every time I see them treat me so respectfully, I get this guilty feeling.”

“This—after this matter is resolved, I’ll fetch someone. Once I bring that person back, I’ll go to your Dragon-Phoenix Palace and explain everything.”

“Really?” Sun Yu beamed.

“Yes.”

“Is the person you’ll fetch the Phoenix Empress?” Sun Yu guessed.

Yang Kai nodded in confirmation. “Yes.”

It was time to fetch Su Yan back. She had been with the Ice Sect for over a decade; seven years had passed since she and Yang Kai last met. Now that the Lingxiao Pavilion crowd had all come to Tongxuan Continent, it was fitting to bring her back to the Sect.

Bringing her home to inherit the Phoenix Empress’s legacy would doubtless elevate her cultivation another stage.

Yang Kai silently looked forward to it.

An hour later, the great column passed the Nine Peaks. At Yang Kai’s order, Xu Hui personally welcomed the Dragon-Phoenix Palace contingent into the Nine Heavens Sacred Land with warmth.

The others continued forward toward the War Soul Hall ruins.

Yang Kai had instructed Xu Hui to present some pills to Dragon-Phoenix Palace as a token of thanks, and Xu Hui would handle that appropriately.

Another hour passed and the people finally reached the War Soul Hall ruins.

From afar, Wu Jie of the Netherworld Sect flew over and greeted them with clasped fists: “Saint Lord Yang, long time no see.”

"Sect Master Wu, have you come to help as well?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Wu Jie chuckled, “There wasn’t much to do, so I brought some disciples to lend a hand. These people are from Saint Lord Yang’s homeland? Quite a number.”

As he spoke he glanced back over Yang Kai’s ranks, inwardly astonished.

“Yes. They’ll live here from now on, not far from the Netherworld Sect; Sect Master Wu, I’ll ask for your continued care.”

“Rest assured—so long as my Netherworld Sect stands, no one can breach our defenses and bully this place,” Wu Jie vowed, thumping his chest in assurance.
