## Chapter 897 — Resonance

"You're really heartless..." An Ling'er drifted out like a ghost, staring toward the direction Yun Xuan had left and sighing softly. "She's in that state—can't you coax her a little? It's just a few sweet words."

"That would only make things worse." Yang Kai shook his head.

"It wouldn't, would it..."

Yang Kai glared at her. "That's exactly why I won't dally with you. Otherwise you'd end up like her!"

"I won't." An Ling'er's face flushed and she hurried away.

Back at the Saint Lord's garden, Yang Kai resumed refining pills.

The five masters keenly noticed a subtle shift in Yang Kai's state of mind; his pill-refining techniques began to falter, and he nearly ruined several valuable ingredients, sending cold sweat through them.

But the troubled mood passed quickly. Yang Kai reclaimed his practiced ease and confidence at the alchemy table, and the masters watched with growing anticipation.

Days slipped into months before anyone realized how much time had passed.

The renown of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s alchemists spread across the continent; their momentum was unmatched in the present age.

Outside the Nine Peaks, life buzzed with activity every day; lines of people waiting to have pills refined were as numerous as fish crossing a river.

Within the Sacred Land, unimaginable wealth and stores of cultivation materials accumulated—holdings that could make any onlooker envious.

Xu Hui and the others could not stop grinning from ear to ear.

In the side chamber, Yang Kai and the five masters sat together for months on end, never stepping outside the main gate.

Each day Yang Kai produced exactly twenty pills, and the five masters watched from start to finish with bright spirits.

They were astonished at his speed and fascinated by the subtlety of his technique.

Producing twenty pills in a single day was beyond any master present.

Spirit-grade pills were a bit easier; if the masters exerted themselves, they might manage seven or eight a day.

But Saint Pills exhausted both spirit and strength; if the masters poured themselves out, at most they could forge two in a day before collapsing from fatigue.

Yet Yang Kai could finish twenty pills in seven or eight hours—sometimes in even less time.

He used the remaining hours to contemplate what he'd gained from refining and to restore his energies.

The masters had come to deeply appreciate how terrifyingly effective Divine Sense Fire could be in pill-refinement.

When Yang Kai refined, they observed; when he rested, they sat together and discussed the day's findings, often arguing heatedly—faces red, tempers flared—over a single technique or the use of a spirit formation.

Yang Kai paid them no mind and never offered his own opinions.

His speed came entirely from Divine Sense Fire. Thus, some of his methods and insights were not suitable for the masters.

Through argument and discussion, the masters deepened their understanding of alchemy and improved their craft.

Sometimes, unable to stay idle, a master would take some of the materials outsiders had brought and refine a pill of their own.

With the masters’ help, Yang Kai grew more relaxed.

He hardly needed to mix medicinal liquids himself; while the masters practiced and realized their own breakthroughs, they handled most of that work—he only combined different elixirs to form the final pills.

It came to look as if the five masters were his assistants, yet they delighted in the arrangement and went about their days cheerfully.

Having five Saint-Grade alchemists assisting him was likely unparalleled across the world.

As word of the alchemist's fame spread, the standing of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land rose accordingly.

Warriors who came to obtain good pills were deeply grateful to the Sacred Land; nowhere else could they acquire pills so swiftly.

At the Sacred Land, they needed wait at most a month or two before their wishes were fulfilled.

News that Saint-Grade alchemists like Du Wan and the others had come to visit the master here spread like wildfire, and many assumed the mysterious figure presiding over the Nine Heavens Sacred Land must be the legendary Tianzang Elder.

Rumors flourished, further boosting the Sacred Land's reputation.

One could say that aside from lacking anyone at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm to guard it, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land now differed little from the top forces in the world; its prestige reached an unprecedented height.

And the name of the Sacred Land's master, Yang Kai, became widely known.

The Sacred Land revived and brimmed with vitality. None were happier than Xu Hui and his peers. A few years earlier, the old Saint Lord had died and no new lord had taken the helm; disciples' hearts had been unstable, and Saintess Nan had caused a great commotion outside, drawing countless experts to besiege the place.

At the time Xu Hui had feared the Sacred Land's legacy might collapse under their generation, feeling despondent and unworthy of the heritage left by past Saint Lords.

But years later, it had become the center of the world's attention.

As a member of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, not only the senior elder Xu Hui but even the disciples beneath him felt overflowing pride.

That pride sparked a virtuous cycle, driving disciples to train harder, terrified of falling behind cultivators from other powers and staining the Sacred Land's reputation.

Looking upon the flourishing Sacred Land, Xu Hui felt that even if he died now, he would die without regret.

......

One day, as Yang Kai was refining, his expression shifted suddenly as if he had detected something; he hurriedly ended his work.

Du Wan was quick to sense the anomaly and asked, "What is it?"

At his question the other four also turned anxious, casting concerned looks.

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. "It's nothing. A while back I refined a secret treasure into my body, and only today did I feel a resonance. I'm eager to probe the treasure's mysteries."

"I see!" Chang Bao nodded. "Go investigate it then. We'll finish the remaining pills for you!"

"Is that allowed?" Yang Kai was startled—he had planned to inspect the treasure first and only then finish the pills. He hadn't expected Chang Bao to offer.

"Why not?" Chang Bao chuckled. "We're Saint-Grade alchemists too. What, you little brat think our skills aren't up to it?"

"Heaven forbid. I'm grateful anyone would lend a hand, and I have full faith in your techniques." Yang Kai smiled in return.

Although the masters sometimes couldn't resist and would forge a pill or two when the itch struck, they'd never overstepped; ordinarily they only observed, and only when unable to help themselves did they refine, so their output was never large.

The refinement session had only just begun today. Aside from the few pills Yang Kai had already made, there remained a dozen-odd pills to be formed. Split among the masters, each would be responsible for three or four.

Most of them were Saint Pills.

Crafting three or four would likely leave each master utterly spent.

"You know how to flatter a man!" Chang Bao laughed heartily, clearly pleased.

"Indeed—it's about time to get our hands dirty. Arguing with these old fellows has grown tiresome; let's settle matters with pills and see whose understanding is deeper." He Feng agreed with Chang Bao's suggestion.

"Agreed—then Yang Kai, leave those dozen-odd pills to us. You go and inspect that secret treasure." Du Wan waved to Yang Kai.

"Very well, thank you all!" Yang Kai accepted. He no longer refused; the masters could handle the remaining pills. Failures were possible, but with the Sacred Land's current resources any losses would be trivial.

He left refreshed and went to another side chamber.

Sitting cross-legged, he focused his mind. A radiance shimmered in his hands as the long shuttle secret treasure he had obtained from the starry sky appeared. With divine thought he probed it closely.

It was this long-shuttle treasure that had just sent out the resonance.

Since he refined it into his body that day, nearly half a year had passed. Though he had been busy refining pills and had not paid it much heed, his True Yuan and Divine Sense had constantly been nurturing it.

That it took so long to resonate surprised Yang Kai.

He still remembered the Silver Leaf treasure—after refining it into his body it took only three months before he fully understood its structure and use.

The Silver Leaf treasure was an Upper-Level Saint-Grade artifact, among the finest secret treasures.

By comparison, this long-shuttle treasure must either be constructed far more complexly or belong to a rank much higher than the Silver Leaf.

Otherwise, such a protracted maturation would be impossible.

Had it not stirred today, Yang Kai might have forgotten about it entirely.

He sent his mind inside and the long shuttle's internal structure became clear.

Yang Kai's expression turned odd.

He found the internal pattern of spirit formations was not as he had expected; rather than intricate and profound, they appeared somewhat crude.

Despite the age-worn markings, Yang Kai couldn't recognize what these spirit formations were meant for.

He was not particularly versed in artifact refinement.

The spirit formations used for forging artifacts and those used in pill refinement were entirely different matters.

Vaguely, Yang Kai sensed the treasure's purpose, but he could not confirm it without trying it out.

He poured True Yuan into it; the palm-sized long shuttle blossomed with golden light and shot from his hand, instantly flying to the other side of the room.

Yang Kai's face changed dramatically.

At that moment he nearly lost track of the long shuttle.

The treasure bore his soul's imprint and life-mark and was tightly linked to him; in theory he should have sensed its movements as if attached to it.

Yet he still had the illusion that he had lost it.

The only explanation was that the treasure moved so fast Yang Kai's thought couldn't catch up before its trajectory completed.

Staring intently at the long shuttle hovering at the other side of the room, Yang Kai furrowed his brow and tried to control it with his divine thought.
