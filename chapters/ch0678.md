## Chapter 678 — As You Wish

It had been almost a month since Yang Kai arrived at the Leiguang Divine Cult, and he was gradually adapting to life there.

When Ji Meng had last come, she had been sent by Duan Hai to bring Yang Kai many medicinal ingredients. Yang Kai casually refined them each day, careful not to produce too many pills to avoid drawing unnecessary attention, keeping to the pace of an ordinary alchemist and producing two or three Spirit-Grade Pills a day.

The rest of his time was spent cultivating himself or probing the mysteries and information hidden within the True Alchemy Formula.

After a month of living together, Yang Kai found that Ji Meng had become much more restrained; whenever she faced him she seemed vulnerable and tentative, nowhere near as carefree and cheerful as she had been when they were on the snowy mountain.

Usually she simply hid away in another room to cultivate, and she and Yang Kai had only met a few times.

Yang Kai was busy with his own affairs and paid little attention to her feelings, which left Ji Meng with a bitter sense of discomfort. Sometimes she wanted to find Yang Kai to talk and deepen their rapport, but she could not bring herself to lower her pride.

One day after a month, Yang Kai was in meditation when someone knocked on the door outside.

"Come in."

Ji Meng pushed the door open and entered, standing at the threshold to perform a salute. "Lord."

"Something?" Yang Kai chuckled lightly, glancing at her casually.

"It's the day to turn in the Pills for this month. I need to take the Pills you've refined during this period to the Divine Cult's main altar," Ji Meng explained softly. This was one of the tasks Duan Hai had assigned her. Every month, the assistants of the alchemist guest lords would collect the Pills refined over that period and deliver them to Duan Hai for use within the Divine Cult.

Yang Kai nodded, took out the Spirit-Grade Pills he had refined recently, and handed them to Ji Meng.

Ji Meng thanked him and accepted them, nibbling her red lip, hesitating as if about to say something. Her expression was strained.

Yang Kai said casually, "I heard other alchemists say that with my permission you can take a few Pills for yourself. Is that so?"

Ji Meng nodded gently.

Yang Kai offered a faint smile. "Then take five Spirit-Grade Pills for yourself."

Although the ingredients used for refining Pills were provided by the Leiguang Divine Cult, alchemists often suffered material losses in the refining process and could fail. When that happened, the materials were wasted.

Therefore, only the alchemist and their assistant truly knew how many Pills were produced each month.

This allowed room for maneuver. Before delivering to the Leiguang Divine Cult's main altar, within acceptable bounds the guest alchemists would withhold a small portion of Pills to cultivate their assistants. This not only benefited their assistants but also won their favor and made them work harder to assist.

This was an open secret, and Duan Hai was aware of the trick, but he had never stopped it.

After all, the Spirit-Grade Pills the alchemists kept were eventually used on the Divine Cult's disciples. Since Duan Hai had sent these talented and attractive women to serve and attend the alchemists, he also hoped they could grow quickly and one day become pillars of the Divine Cult.

Yang Kai had learned this through casual conversations with other alchemists.

Hearing Yang Kai say this, Ji Meng was overjoyed and kept thanking him. "Thank you, Lord. I will make good use of these five Spirit-Grade Pills."

She was only at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, so the spirit Pills could provide her with a significant boost.

Yang Kai did not say more. He issued a receipt detailing how many spirit Pills he had refined that month and let her take it with the Pills to give to Duan Hai.

Ji Meng was grateful and quickly left the peak.

Back at the Divine Cult's main altar, she handed the spirit Pills and Yang Kai's receipt to Duan Hai. Duan Hai counted the Pills and nodded approvingly.

As Ji Meng was about to take her leave, Duan Hai called her back.

"Elder, is there something else?" Ji Meng asked, puzzled.

"What do you think of him?" Duan Hai suddenly asked a question that left Ji Meng at a loss.

"He's all right. He's a bit taciturn and doesn't communicate much. I stayed there a month and spoke less than ten sentences to him," Ji Meng replied.

"You didn't talk much to him?" Duan Hai exclaimed. "Has he—"

Ji Meng's face flushed red and she hurriedly shook her head.

Duan Hai frowned, displeased. "You should know the purpose I sent you there. These guest alchemists are the foundation for the growth of our Divine Cult, but they are guests and could leave at any time. You must secure him firmly—ideally get him to willingly join the Divine Cult as a disciple!"

"I will, Disciple understands," Ji Meng bowed her head.

"Are you up to this task? If not, I can send someone else. The Divine Cult is not short of beautiful women."

"I will do my best," Ji Meng answered through gritted teeth.

"Good. Go, I look forward to your results," Duan Hai waved his hand.

Ji Meng left with a heavy heart. After she departed, Duan Hai shook his head and said to Xu Qi, who had been sitting nearby listening, "Junior Brother, it seems this person truly doesn't intend to stay long in our Divine Cult. When we brought him over he said as much. A young man full of vigor cannot remain unmoved before beauty forever."

"That indicates he has his own convictions and objectives. People like that tend to be headstrong and hard to control," Xu Qi sighed in agreement.

"But he did say that when the time was right, he'd ask our Divine Cult for a favor. I wonder what he meant by that," Duan Hai mused suspiciously.

"So what do you plan to do, Senior Brother?"

"We'll wait and see. The Duao Alliance has already sent someone to dig up more on him. A young Spirit-Grade alchemist like him… I really feel sorry."

Xu Qi nodded in agreement. If possible, they had no desire to offend Yang Kai and would rather be on good terms with him.

When Ji Meng returned, Yang Kai clearly noticed she seemed melancholy and burdened with thoughts.

Yang Kai didn't pry; it's normal for women to have worries, and prying would only lead to trouble. He continued to immerse himself in his own affairs daily.

Although there was the protection of Elder Du and Duan Hai's friendship, he would not be so foolish as to completely trust Duan Hai. During this time he also investigated the Leiguang Divine Cult to determine whether he could entrust them to help find Su Yan and Little Senior Sister.

If it proved impossible, Yang Kai would not hesitate to leave.

He certainly could not return to the Duao Alliance; so many people had seen him captured by the Coffin-Servant that if he surfaced at the Duao Alliance he would become the center of attention.

A fierce pain flared along the muscles between his shoulder blades as the concealed wind-and-thunder force began to act up. Yang Kai was jolted out of meditation; before he even opened his eyes an intoxicating fragrance reached his nose.

Raising his eyes in surprise, he saw Ji Meng standing at the bedside, watching him intently, complex emotions flickering in her beautiful eyes.

"What are you doing?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

Ji Meng's face flushed; she seemed flustered, but quickly composed herself, bit her lip, lowered herself, and sat on the edge of the bed. With a forced smile she murmured, "Doesn't that make you a little tempted?"

"You mean in that way?" Yang Kai's expression grew odd.

"What do you think?" Ji Meng stared at him brightly. Though she looked shy, she was audacious to the extreme, proactively taking one of Yang Kai's hands and guiding it to rest atop her supple bosom.

"Are you serious?" Yang Kai felt the firmness and fullness, the astonishing springiness, and was momentarily taken aback.

He had not expected Ji Meng to make such a move.

In the palm of that hand, a small bump gradually stiffened.

Ji Meng breathed heavily, her cheeks burning like fire. She shamelessly glanced down at Yang Kai's lower body, her small hand trembling as she fumbled there, scent like orchids spilling on a breeze. "All the disciples sent here as assistants were prepared for this; you guest alchemists may do as you wish."

Yang Kai gripped the little hand she placed on him and frowned. "Is this your will, or Duan Hai's order?"

"Does it matter?"

"Ji Meng, this is not your true nature. Why force yourself?"

Ji Meng was stunned for a moment, then bit her lip and snapped, "Are you even a man? You're unmoved at a time like this."

Yang Kai sneered. "Whether I'm a man or not doesn't need proving to you."

"But you said on the snowy mountain you would show me," Ji Meng pressed closer, her fragrance intoxicating and disorienting.

"I don't like overly flirtatious women, but if you want to play, I can accommodate you," Yang Kai grinned.

"Then let's play!" Ji Meng glared at him with hungry eyes.

Yang Kai's smile turned even more wicked. He reached out, pulled Ji Meng over, pinned her on the bed, and covered her perky breasts with his large hand, kneading.

"What are you doing?" Ji Meng cried out in alarm. This rascal had been nonchalant a moment ago and now suddenly released this bestial side, which overwhelmed her.

"As you wished," Yang Kai sneered.

"Then you must promise me one thing!" Ji Meng hurriedly demanded. Under Yang Kai's touch she immediately grew dazed, calling softly, her cheeks flushed, her body burning.

"What is it?"

"Once you take me, you must join my Divine Cult and become a disciple of the Divine Cult!"

"And if I say no?"

“When you finally come to your senses, you may take me. Until then, do as you like—everything but that.”

Hearing her bargaining with him, Yang Kai's ardor instantly cooled. He frowned, hauled her up, and said flatly, "It's late. Go back and rest."

Ji Meng stared at him in stunned disappointment, her face full of sorrowful complaint.

She realized she had been too hasty.

With a complicated expression she offered a quick apology, smoothed her disheveled clothes, and withdrew slowly.

After she left, Yang Kai smiled slightly, convinced that after suffering this small loss she would likely no longer behave so wantonly in his presence.

He had once had a good impression of her: frank, straightforward, and outspoken. But now it seemed he should not get too close; it was best to keep a distance to avoid future entanglements.
