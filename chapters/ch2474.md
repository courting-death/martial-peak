## Chapter 2474 — Eating People

As the area of the Origin Sea shrank, many cultivators began fighting fiercely to seize territory once more. For a time, the edges of the Origin Sea were thrown into utter chaos.

Although this situation had not yet spread deeper, it was easy to imagine that, as time passed, those cultivators who had originally been deeper inside would inevitably encounter the same predicament, and in the end, none would be able to remain unaffected.

Meanwhile, on a shattered star somewhere far from the Origin Sea.

It seemed a great battle had just taken place here. The cold surface of the star was a complete mess, and the chaotic fluctuations of power had yet to subside.

A man and a woman lay on the ground, their bodies immobilized by some unknown secret art. Though not dead, they could not move at all, their eyes wide with terror as they stared at a middle-aged man standing not far in front of them.

The middle-aged man was tall and broad-shouldered, with a rugged, imposing appearance. An unsettling aura radiated from his entire being, making anyone near him feel deeply uneasy. His eyes gleamed with a chilling light, sending a shiver down the spine of anyone who met his gaze.

Several deep wounds marred his body, flesh torn open to reveal stark white bone beneath. Blood poured freely, pooling at his feet—a gruesome and shocking sight.

Yet this middle-aged man seemed to feel no pain at all. On the contrary, he even appeared to enjoy it, grinning savagely.

"You... who are you, really?!" the man lying on the ground cried out in terror, his face pale.

The middle-aged man glanced at him sideways and snorted, "You’re about to die. Why do you need to know so much?"

"You... you’re going to kill us?" the man exclaimed in shock, his voice trembling with anger. "My Junior Sister and I have no grudge or enmity with you—why are you doing this to us?"

The two of them had been peacefully absorbing Origin Power here, but this middle-aged man had suddenly descended from the sky and, without a word, attacked them violently.

Relying on their numbers, they hadn’t been too afraid and fought back against him.

But to their utter shock, the outcome was completely unexpected—the two fellow disciples were utterly powerless before this man, not even close to being his match.

Although this middle-aged man was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm and had not advanced to the Emperor Realm, his strength was far beyond the Dao Origin Realm. In just a few moves, he had knocked them to the ground. They had no idea what strange secret art he had used, but it left both him and his Junior Sister completely unable to move.

"Wrong!" The middle-aged man gave a bizarre smile that sent chills down their spines and said lightly, "This Lord is not here to kill you!"

"Not going to kill us..." The rather attractive woman relaxed at his words, forcing a smile and coaxing, "Sir, as long as you don’t kill us, anything can be discussed."

The man from before stared at her in astonishment, his eyes bulging. He called out softly, "Junior Sister, you..."

It was as if he was meeting his Junior Sister for the first time. He had never imagined she would say such things to a stranger, and a sharp pain stabbed at his heart.

"Anything can be discussed..." The middle-aged man smiled faintly, shifting his gaze to the woman.

The woman forced a smile. "Sir, you can do whatever you want, just don’t kill me!"

Her Senior Brother, listening at the side, nearly coughed up blood in anger. Fury surged in his heart, but he dared not say a word.

The middle-aged man let out a wicked laugh. "What if I want to eat you?"

The Senior Brother’s face turned pale at those words—just what he feared most had come to pass. But he also knew that, under the eaves, one had to bow their head. If his Junior Sister could trade her body and looks for their lives, it was not unacceptable. After all, staying alive was most important; if you died, nothing else mattered.

With this thought, he gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and decided to see no evil.

"Eat me..." A blush crept over the woman’s face. She stammered, "Then you must be gentle."

The middle-aged man’s eyes lit up with excitement, and he nodded. "Don’t worry, don’t worry. Don’t judge this Lord by his looks—this Lord is a gentle person."

As he spoke, he walked step by step toward the woman.

Seeing this, the woman hurriedly said, "Not here... Can we find a more secluded place?"

Though she was willing to submit to survive, it was still embarrassing to do so under her Senior Brother’s gaze. She only hoped the middle-aged man would take her somewhere private. As long as she survived, he could do whatever he wanted.

The middle-aged man chuckled. "It’s the same wherever."

He seemed to have a perverse hobby and insisted on doing what came next right in front of the Senior Brother. The woman understood and glanced worriedly at her Senior Brother, only to find him with his eyes shut and head turned away, though his body trembled with rage.

The woman knew her Senior Brother must be feeling terrible, but with her life on the line, she couldn’t comfort him—she could only grit her teeth and accept her fate.

The middle-aged man walked up to her, looking down from above. His burning gaze was completely undisguised, as if he wanted to melt her.

The woman’s heart trembled. She knew that, at this point, nothing she said would help.

"Children shouldn’t watch. Close your eyes," the middle-aged man instructed calmly.

The woman sighed softly and obediently closed her eyes, finding it a bit funny. She might look young, but she was no child, and she understood the ways of men and women. This man’s tastes were truly odd.

Only then did the middle-aged man reach out, pull her over, and wrap his arms tightly around her soft waist.

In an instant, the woman was squeezed so tightly she could barely breathe, letting out a soft whimper.

She could clearly feel the man’s breathing grow rapid, his scorching breath on her neck making her body go weak and her cheeks flush.

But just then, she suddenly heard a sound that made her hair stand on end.

"Heaven Devouring Battle Art!"

The next moment, a sharp pain shot through her neck, as if she’d been bitten by a wild beast. Her face went pale with shock. She quickly opened her eyes and turned to look.

The scene she’d imagined—being violated—did not happen. Instead, the middle-aged man’s eyes were blood-red, his head tilted, mouth clamped on her neck, gulping down her blood.

Not only that, but he seemed to be using some strange and sinister technique. The woman could clearly feel her Qi and blood and all her cultivation rapidly draining away.

"Ah..." The woman screamed in terror, finally realizing that what the man meant by eating her was not what she had thought.

He really was going to eat her!

"Senior Brother, save me!" she cried out in panic.

Her Senior Brother, who had been enduring his humiliation with eyes closed, sensed something was wrong. He quickly turned his head and was shocked by what he saw.

The man’s mouth was covered in blood, biting into his Junior Sister’s slender, fair neck, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed her blood.

Before his eyes, his Junior Sister’s beautiful face rapidly withered, and even her long hair turned white.

"Senior Brother... save me!" the woman called out again.

But her Senior Brother was so frightened his soul nearly left his body. He was completely unresponsive, staring blankly at the horrifying scene, feeling cold seep into his bones.

"Se...nior Brother!" In less than five breaths, the woman’s appearance became withered, her whole body shrouded in death. With great effort, she uttered two words, and the light in her eyes faded, leaving her lifeless.

She died just like that.

The middle-aged man waved his hand, tossing her corpse aside. He wiped his mouth and took a deep breath, his expression showing satisfaction.

The terrifying wounds on his body began to heal at a speed visible to the naked eye. In the blink of an eye, he was completely recovered, his skin smoother than a newborn’s.

"Th-this..." The Senior Brother was dumbfounded by what he had just witnessed, unable to comprehend what he had seen.

Seeing the middle-aged man turn his gaze on him, he hurriedly begged, "Spare me, my lord! Spare me!"

The sight of his Junior Sister’s tragic death kept flashing before his eyes. He did not want to die the same way.

The middle-aged man snorted coldly, stretched out a hand from afar, and shouted, "Heaven Devouring Battle Art!"

As his profound art activated, a terrifying suction force emanated from his palm. The Senior Brother, lying on the ground, screamed as his Qi and blood and all his strength were uncontrollably drawn toward the middle-aged man, who absorbed it all.

"If you kill me, my Senior Brother won’t let you go! Our sect’s Senior Brother has already advanced to the Emperor Realm!" the man shouted, hoping to make the other hesitate.

But the middle-aged man only sneered. "Emperor Realm... so what? This Lord has never eaten an Emperor before. If your Senior Brother really comes for revenge, this Lord doesn’t mind sending him to join you."

"You... madman, madman! You’ll die a horrible death!" the man cursed through gritted teeth, but his voice grew weaker and weaker, and he soon followed his Junior Sister in death.

Two Star Seals flew from the two corpses and embedded themselves in the middle-aged man’s hand.

The Star Seal the man possessed was the same Seven-Pointed Star Seal as Yang Kai’s, but its brilliance was even stronger, as if it was about to advance to an Eight-Pointed Star Seal. It was clear how many people he had killed in the Shattered Star Sea.

After killing the two, the middle-aged man stood silently for a moment, as if sensing something. Suddenly, his expression twisted with rage. He threw his hands to the sky and let out a furious howl, not the least bit pleased by his slaughter—only consumed by violent anger.

After a long time, his howl subsided. He gritted his teeth and muttered, "Bottleneck, bottleneck! Why won’t I break through to Emperor Realm? Seven hundred years—I’ve worked for seven hundred years! Why can’t I break through? Damn heavens, so unfair! I refuse to accept this!"

After cursing for a while, he suddenly roared in fury, "Useless trash, every last one of them! Not a single one could withstand the backlash of this divine art. None of them compare to this Lord’s natural talent—they’re all worthless!"

As he cursed, he vented his power recklessly, blasting the surroundings into utter chaos, as if possessed by madness.
