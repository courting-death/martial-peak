## Chapter 1403 — Demonization

"Boy, spare others where you can; if you insist on fighting me to the death, beware I might shatter your teeth!" Elder Du growled, voice fierce yet inwardly weak.

"Oh? Then let's see how many of my teeth that body of yours can break." Yang Kai's eyes flashed with cold light; he refused to back down.

The enemy had already fought his way into his home — how could Yang Kai show mercy and let them leave unharmed? He had resolved to slay every intruder into Dragon Lair Mountain; the kind are taken advantage of, the docile are mounted, and it was time Dragon Lair Mountain bared its fangs.

Hearing Yang Kai's reply, Elder Du's eyes flickered with a hard cruelty, and he ground his teeth: "Are you truly so resolute?"

Yang Kai said nothing. He raised his long sword and with a slash of sword radiance lunged forward, answering him with action.

"You force me to this!" Elder Du's face twisted into a terrifying snarl. He stood his ground without dodging, treating the sword radiance as if it were nothing, as though utterly unafraid.

Yang Kai lifted an eyebrow, his expression turning grave. He did not think the man was courting death — from his words and current look, the elder clearly had a trump card left undisclosed. If he dared swagger like this, he must be confident he could withstand the strike.

With that thought, Yang Kai ceased hesitating. He snapped his fingers and a Space Blade silently shot forth toward him.

Yang Kai had no intention of letting the elder play his final card; he planned to settle matters with the Space Blade.

The black sword radiance led the way, the Space Blade followed, hidden and interleaved, unnoticed by Elder Du — yet he still stood motionless, producing a jade box from his spatial pouch.

The jade box opened to reveal a pill the size of a longan, blood-red in color.

Elder Du pinched the pill and tossed it straight into his mouth, gulping it down.

Whether it was a trick of perception or not, as he swallowed the pill Yang Kai plainly saw a flash of longing and struggle in the elder's eyes — as if he were recalling something.

At the same time, the black sword radiance had already closed to three zhang before him, poised to strike his body.

But at that moment a gargantuan form suddenly fell from the sky, accompanied by a thunderous crash and the trembling of the earth; it interposed itself before Elder Du.

Ssssss...

The sword radiance struck the monstrous form, producing a screeching sound and a pained gurgle.

A Green-Eyed Blood Toad!

At the crucial moment, Elder Du had summoned back his Green-Eyed Blood Toad. Though a Ninth-Tier demonic beast, it was far weaker than the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird; its only advantage was its thick hide and tough flesh.

In the short time it took the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird to clash with it, the toad had been left battered and raw; its body was covered in burns from the Blazing Flame, large blisters replaced its original warts, and multicolored venom leaked from its wounds with a nauseating stench.

Even so, it had not died; had it been any other Ninth-Tier demonic beast, it would likely already be dead.

Already riddled with wounds, the toad was cleaved by Yang Kai's sword radiance, leaving a long gash that revealed pale bone.

Elder Du seemed oblivious; as if the beast before him were not the one he had raised. He slapped its back and poured Saint Yuan into it desperately.

Soundlessly, the Space Blade that followed the sword radiance arrived and scored a crescent-shaped, foot-long wound across the toad's belly.

Targets struck by the Space Blade are exiled into the void, so wounds inflicted by the Space Blade cannot be healed.

Yang Kai's Space Blade was powerful, and the toad's toughness considerable; the attack merely pierced through, and then the Space Blade's power dissipated.

Seeing this, Yang Kai felt some regret — if the Space Blade had pushed forward another two feet, perhaps it could have slain Elder Du as well.

Considering that now was clearly useless.

Even the thick-skinned toad was beyond recovery after such grievous injuries and would surely die. As its keeper, Elder Du seemed to suffer backlash; while desperately urging Saint Yuan, he coughed up fresh blood and looked toward the toad in horror.

Sensing the life tied to his familiar draining rapidly, Elder Du frenziedly poured Saint Yuan into it. The toad's body visibly swelled, becoming round and bloated as if it might burst at any moment.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and issued a command to the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit. With a clear bird cry, a red light darted toward the scene.

Before the Artifact Spirit could reach it, there was an explosion; the toad dissolved into a mist of blood and venom, leaving no bones — the air filled with that multicolored poisonous haze and fluid.

The Artifact Spirit, frightened, immediately circled and shot up into the sky.

But Elder Du's expression was twisted and grotesquely joyful as he stood there, relishing the baptism of venom and mist. Unknown to Yang Kai, whatever technique or secret art he practiced seemed to allow him to absorb the poison and mist into his body.

He then reached out and seized the toad's Inner Core, stuffing it into his mouth and chewing greedily.

A flurry of changes unfolded in an instant, leaving Yang Kai stunned.

After absorbing the blood-mist and swallowing the toad's Inner Core, Elder Du's appearance transformed into something horrifying: lumps sprouted across his exposed skin, oozing foul venom from which the toad's likeness seemed to have been taken.

The old man had always been unsightly; now he was truly ghastly.

Moreover, his eyeballs had turned a jade color, seemingly containing some subtle profundity.

Laughably, his cheeks had puffed up like the Green-Eyed Blood Toad's, a comical sight.

Yang Kai could not laugh. Elder Du's aura had risen dramatically, giving off an extremely dangerous impression.

"Good, good, good!" Elder Du laughed wildly, his jade eyes coldly fixed on Yang Kai. "To force the old man to demonize — you will at least die a worthy death!"

Demonization! Yang Kai's brow twitched. Though he had never heard of it, he guessed it was a forbidden secret of Myriad Beasts Mountain; their cultivators constantly dealt with demonic beasts and used them in battle, so such a technique was not impossible.

With his sight he could tell Elder Du was no longer fully human — he had become something half human, half demon.

Inside his body thrummed not only Saint Yuan but also demonic energy; the two overlapped into something terrifying.

This must be a secret art with dire consequences, impossible to reverse. Yang Kai judged this instantly; otherwise Elder Du would not have waited until now to use it. Saint Yuan and demonic energy are fundamentally incompatible and cannot coexist in one body.

Yang Kai's intuition was correct. Myriad Beasts Mountain's demonization art carried terrible aftermath and could not be reversed. Even if one later suppressed the demonic energy, the practitioner's cultivation would be largely ruined; otherwise the demonic backlash would surely kill them.

He had been driven to desperation; otherwise he would not have been so reckless.

Elder Du's aura surged. Yang Kai remained calm; with a gesture the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit circled back — man and Artifact Spirit eyed the elder like predators.

Elder Du wasted no time. As demonization completed and his cheeks bulged, he casually exhaled and spat a jade-green venom arrow that streaked toward Yang Kai.

After demonizing, he could use the Green-Eyed Blood Toad's abilities.

Yang Kai's brow lifted. He would not stand idle; he flickered aside.

Unexpectedly, the venom arrow exploded in midair into countless droplets that sprayed in all directions.

In the scramble, Yang Kai could only condense his Saint Yuan to form a protective barrier over his body.

Ssssh— the droplets struck the Saint Yuan and corroded small pits in the Demonic Flame shroud. After demonization, the venom had seemingly grown far stronger.

Before Yang Kai could investigate further, a perilous aura pressed down from above.

Yang Kai cried out and thrust a palm upward, unleashing a violent burst of Saint Yuan.

A crushing force descended; Yang Kai was driven downward. When he looked up there was no visible enemy — only through Divine Sense did he perceive Elder Du pirouetting around him at incredible speed, searching for weaknesses and waiting to strike.

This speed was not human; it seemed demonization had endowed Elder Du with the Green-Eyed Blood Toad's springing ability.

This was troublesome. With such speed he would be hard to hit. But it was two against one; the Artifact Spirit was a fine ally and occupied the formation's advantage. Unperturbed, Yang Kai sent a command through Divine Sense to the Artifact Spirit.

The Fire Bird burst apart into countless tiny birds, each identical to the Artifact Spirit but scaled down by leagues. They swarmed, filling the vast space.

Suddenly a few of the little birds cried out and ignited, bursting into flame.

Over there, Elder Du flickered and had no choice but to appear; a trace of hatred crossed his face.

He hadn't expected Yang Kai to use the Artifact Spirit to probe for his position and thus had been exposed.

Golden threads shot forward and fragmented into a rain of golden light that swept over him.

Those threads carried a razor intent — anyone cut by them would meet a grim end. Elder Du's expression shifted; jade color surged in his eyes as he stared at Yang Kai.

An invisible force leapt from his Sea of Consciousness toward Yang Kai's mind.
