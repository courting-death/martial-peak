## Chapter 395 — The Pill Liquid I Configured Myself

Lingxiao Pavilion is not only Yang Kai's sect but also that of Fourth Master Yang. How could he not be concerned?

Yang Kai wore a solemn expression as he briefly recounted the various injustices that had occurred within the sect. Yang Yingfeng listened with an ashen face, his anger reaching a boiling point.

"But now it’s good. Qiu Yimeng is helping to rebuild Lingxiao Pavilion, and it is already under my name. Until the sect is officially named, it is merely my property!" The gloom in Yang Kai's brow gradually eased.

"Qiu Yimeng?" Yang Yingfeng and Dong Suzhu stared at Yang Kai in astonishment. "That Miss Qiu from the Qiu Family?"

"Yes."

"How could she possibly help rebuild Lingxiao Pavilion? It was her family's expert who burned it down in the first place. It doesn't make sense," Yang Yingfeng replied, furrowing his brow in confusion as he shook his head and asked, "Is there some underlying reason?"

"I helped her with something, a mutual favor. Rebuilding Lingxiao Pavilion is not a big deal for her," Yang Kai said casually.

"You helped her with something?" The expression on Fourth Master Yang's face became even more peculiar, looking at Yang Kai with disbelief as if he never imagined that Yang Kai could become entangled with the Qiu Family’s young lady in his years away.

Dong Suzhu, however, was smiling and looking significantly at Yang Kai. "Son, you must be quite close with her?"

"Not too close, but not unfamiliar either," Yang Kai nodded faintly.

Dong Suzhu pursed her crimson lips and appeared to be deep in thought before chuckling lightly. "The young lady from the Qiu Family is quite remarkable. If she were a man, she would definitely be the next head of the Qiu Family. Son, work hard. Win her over."

Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

As for Qiu Yimeng, he had no thoughts of courting her. It was undeniable that this woman was charming and had a strong background. If he could win her favor, it would be of great help in the competition for the position of family head. However, Yang Kai instinctively rejected the idea.

She felt too charming. Such charm should not exist in a young girl; perhaps it was the sorrow of coming from a large family.

Cooperation was possible, but there could absolutely be nothing more between them.

"For the sect to be officially named..." Yang Yingfeng muttered to himself. "Qiu Yimeng can't become the head of the Qiu Family. That really won't work."

If any of the Eight Great Families from Zhongdu spoke up to officially name Lingxiao Pavilion, the slander hanging over it could be easily removed.

The name of the evil sect wasn't really that serious.

The most important thing was that Lingxiao Pavilion had birthed an evil lord! That was the true reason the world feared and detested it.

"Do you have any news about the Master?" Yang Kai asked solemnly.

Yang Yingfeng shook his head bitterly. "I have sent people to inquire from various sources, but after that battle, your Master and several elders of the sect have gone missing, and I have been unable to find any leads."

After pausing, Yang Yingfeng suddenly remembered something and asked eagerly, "Did your Master really advance to beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?"

At the time the experts from the Qiu Family sent word back, Yang Yingfeng received the news immediately, but after all, it was merely the one-sided word of those experts from the Qiu Family. Perhaps they made up stories to shirk responsibility, and Fourth Master Yang did not dare to fully believe it.

Not to mention Yang Yingfeng. Others who heard the news were still somewhat skeptical!

How could a mere second-rate sect produce such a super expert?

"It’s true that he advanced." Yang Kai nodded seriously.

Only upon receiving Yang Kai's affirmation did Yang Yingfeng's mouth break into a smile. He began to pace in the study before suddenly stopping, slapping his thigh with excitement. "Good, good! I knew Master would certainly advance, but I never expected it to happen so late!"

While speaking, Fourth Master Yang's expression relaxed, as if he had put down a heavy stone within his heart.

Ling Taixu had been moping over the matters involving two of his disciples back then, burdened with inner turmoil. He had wasted years in vain, but now that he had finally made a breakthrough, it must surely be because he had resolved his inner conflicts, which made Yang Yingfeng feel happy for him.

"Actually, Master also turned misfortune into blessing." Yang Kai’s eyes shifted, suddenly realizing an idea. "The evil lord emerged from Dragon Confinement Ravine, clashing with the sect's experts, and one elder was killed on the spot while Master also sustained severe wounds."

"This unworthy disciple!" Yang Yingfeng could not help but curse angrily, his rage boiling over.

That evil lord, in fact, was still Yang Yingfeng's junior brother. Now he had committed acts of treason against his own sect, killing his fellow disciples, which made the Fourth Master furious.

"One day, I will make him kneel before Master and admit his mistakes!" Yang Yingfeng seethed for a moment before hurriedly asking, "What happened next?"

"Later, Master was besieged by evil energy, his life hanging by a thread. Seeing it was hopeless, I tried giving him something to take." 

"You gave him something?" Yang Yingfeng's eyes widened in disbelief, while Dong Suzhu covered her mouth, her expression tense as the couple held their breath in anticipation.

"Yes, just a little pill liquid I configured myself. I never expected it to be effective, not only bringing Master back from the brink but also dispelling the evil energy inside him," Yang Kai said, forcing a smile as he described it vividly. "Once Master recovered, he advanced."

"You configured this pill liquid yourself?" Yang Yingfeng's expression changed to one of dread, his face turning pale.

Dong Suzhu also nervously patted her chest, secretly relieved that no major incident occurred. Otherwise, the charge of treason would not rest on the head of the evil lord but would fall upon Yang Kai instead.

If that had happened, Fourth Master Yang would have been left feeling guilty beyond measure.

Yang Kai sniffled and said, "Actually, I understand some pharmacology. I studied at Yao Wang Valley's Hidden Cloud Peak."

"I see!" Yang Yingfeng exclaimed, suddenly enlightened.

"You all knew?" Yang Kai was astonished; neither of the elders showed any signs of surprise, as if they had already known about it.

"Yes, Qinghan secretly informed us," Dong Suzhu nodded.

That made sense; Dong Qinghan was indeed the nephew of Yang Kai’s mother, so it was not surprising that he sent word.

"Master Xiao truly deserves the title of Master," Yang Yingfeng sighed. "He didn't even need to take action personally, just teaching you some things led to such miraculous results."

After a moment of reflection, he once again nodded gravely. "I need to properly thank Master when I have the chance."

Yang Kai chuckled lightly and nodded. "Of course."

"When I have time, I will personally visit Hidden Cloud Peak to express gratitude for Master’s saving grace, as it equates to saving my life. I cannot let this go unacknowledged," Fourth Master Yang said earnestly, filled with gratitude.

Yang Kai immediately felt anxious.

If Fourth Master went to Hidden Cloud Peak and they faced each other, wouldn't his lies be exposed? He quickly said, "Dad, it's best if you don't go. Master has a rather strange temper, and it's uncertain if you'll even meet him. It’s better if I go myself."

Yang Yingfeng thought for a while and felt that Yang Kai's reasoning was sound. Over the years, how many people from the Eight Great Families had attempted to seek out Xiao Fusheng to refine pills at Hidden Cloud Peak? Yet, how many had successfully met him? Most returned home without even catching a glimpse of the Master. He nodded in agreement, "That makes sense. If I do go, I must prepare more gifts."

"Yes, I understand." Yang Kai secretly wiped away a bead of cold sweat.

Dong Suzhu suddenly had an excited expression, softly asking, "Son, do you remember the method to configure the pill liquid?"

Yang Kai smiled and replied, "Of course I remember."

"Then..." Dong Suzhu's heartbeat quickened, looking at Yang Kai with anticipation and tension.

Yang Kai could not have known what she was looking forward to.

Fourth Master Yang had been injured by the evil lord and had suffered from this chronic ailment until now, with some traces of evil energy still lingering within him.

If it were not for this reason, how could Yang Yingfeng still be stuck at the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm? Even Dong Suzhu was already at the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm!

Back when he was Yang Taixu's eldest disciple, Fourth Master Yang was a top talent. The evil lord was his junior and had talent beyond compare. Now he had already reached beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. Yang Yingfeng, as a senior brother who had been looked upon favorably by Ling Taixu, must not have inferior talent compared to the evil lord. If it were not for the events of that year, how could he only have reached the Third Stage now? He should at least be at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm!

In the end, the traces of evil energy inside Yang Yingfeng and Ling Taixu originated from the same source, and the latter was even stronger.

The miraculous pill liquid had managed to dispel the evil energy within Ling Taixu; perhaps it could also resolve the evil energy within Yang Yingfeng. If Fourth Master’s chronic ailment could be cured, his future would be bright, and he might even advance beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

Once known as the direct descendants of the Yang Family, Fourth Master Yang’s talent had been among the top. He was certainly superior to the current head, Yang Yinghao.

"The pill liquid can be configured, and the materials needed aren't too complex." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Fourth Master Yang and his wife’s breathing suddenly became rapid.

"Dad, I need to check your condition first."

"Alright!" Yang Yingfeng nodded, sitting beside Yang Kai and extending a hand.

Yang Kai placed two fingers on it, gently operating his True Yuan and carefully investigating.

As the True Yuan entered his body, Yang Yingfeng's expression suddenly changed, looking at Yang Kai in astonishment, not expecting his son’s True Yuan to be so pure and abundant.

Though it was just a trace, it revealed a lot. The True Yuan within his son was evidently extraordinary, seeming no less impressive than his own accumulated years of experience.

His son was only at the Seventh Stage of the True Yuan Realm! If given time and realm improvement, to what extent could his True Yuan become pure and powerful?

This child... seemed somewhat miraculous.

Was this really his son? Fourth Master Yang suddenly felt an unreal sensation.

After a long while, Yang Kai solemnly withdrew his hand.

"How is it?" Dong Suzhu asked, her voice trembling.

"It's better than Master was back then. It can be cured, but because so much time has passed, that trace of evil energy has attached itself to your Dantian, making it not too easy to resolve. Dad will need to take this kind of pill liquid regularly until it is completely eradicated."

"As long as it can be cured, that's good!" Dong Suzhu felt joy welling up in her heart upon hearing this. She exchanged glances with Yang Yingfeng, both seeing the joy in each other’s eyes.

Over the years, the couple had sought renowned doctors and tried various methods, yet they still couldn't disperse the trace of evil energy in his Dantian. Even the Yang Family’s Transformation Dragon Pool had no effect.

But now, the troubles that had plagued them for many years had been effortlessly resolved since their son returned.

They suddenly felt that in this world, no one was more capable than their son!
