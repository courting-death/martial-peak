## Chapter 2119 — Greetings, Aunt Feng

No matter how much he thought about it, Yang Kai couldn’t figure it out.

He hadn’t been in the Star Realm for long, and he’d only met a handful of Emperor Realm cultivators. If he’d really seen this red-clothed woman before, he would definitely remember.

So, there were only two possible explanations for the current situation…

First, the other party was here on business, and he and Qin Chaoyang had accidentally intruded.

Second, the other party was here waiting for him and Qin Chaoyang…

The second possibility was basically impossible, so it had to be the first, right?

Just as Yang Kai’s thoughts were racing, the red-clothed woman lightly parted her vermilion lips. Her voice was ethereal and pleasant as she said lazily, “To be speaking with this Lord while still hiding inside that tower-ship—you’ve got quite the nerve.”

Her lips were all smiles, but her eyes were icy cold.

As she spoke, she raised a hand; her slender jade fingers snapped with a crisp sound.

Scorching power suddenly appeared, and a fist-sized fireball materialized in front of her. With a slight tremor, it shot straight toward the tower-ship.

Both Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang’s faces changed dramatically. Without thinking, they both leaped out.

“Boom…” A deafening explosion rang out as the massive tower-ship was instantly engulfed in Blazing Flame. Qin Chaoyang, struck by the terrifying shockwave, was knocked unconscious and fell from midair to the grass below, his fate unknown.

Yang Kai also felt a searing pain on his back, as if several ribs had snapped.

Regaining his footing, he looked back to see the tower-ship completely wrapped in flames, burning fiercely. In the blink of an eye, it was reduced to ashes.

"My Secret Treasure!" Yang Kai cried out, his heart bleeding with pain!

He’d finally acquired a flying Secret Treasure for travel of respectable grade, yet on his very first trip it was destroyed by some inexplicable Emperor Realm cultivator.

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, the red-clothed woman’s lips curled again, and a barely perceptible smile flashed in her icy eyes. She said indifferently, “Boy, instead of worrying about your Secret Treasure, shouldn’t you be more concerned about your own life?”

“Senior, who exactly are you? Why attack us?” Yang Kai turned to look at her, shouting sternly.

He was truly furious beyond words!

The other party was at least a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert. With just a word, she destroyed his Secret Treasure. And from her tone, she clearly wasn’t done—she even wanted to attack him. Naturally, Yang Kai found this intolerable!

“Who this Lord is… you don’t need to know.” The red-clothed woman smiled faintly, a smile that could topple nations. As she spoke, she took a few lotus steps—who knew what divine ability she used, but in just a few steps, she was ten zhang in front of Yang Kai. She gently raised a jade hand toward where Yang Kai stood and continued, “It’s just that this Lord… finds you an eyesore!”

With that, her jade hand slapped downward!

The laws of heaven and earth suddenly solidified. Boundless pressure descended from above, and Yang Kai’s bones all creaked as if he would be crushed into a meat patty by that terrifying force!

“Are you insane?” Yang Kai’s face was ashen. He never imagined he’d one day suffer such a calamity—just because the other party found him displeasing, she wanted to kill him.

As he spoke, his Origin Qi surged, and a four-finger-wide sword appeared in his hand. He shouted in a low voice, “One sword sweeps a million, a lone man holds the pass!”

Sword light flashed, sword energy sang.

Shhh shhh shhh shhh…

In that instant, the Myriad Sword seemed to multiply into countless blades, densely arrayed around Yang Kai, shooting toward the sky like a swarm of locusts.

“Oh? An Imperial Treasure?” A trace of surprise flashed in the red-clothed woman’s beautiful eyes, but she didn’t care, only mocked, “With such weak cultivation, how much of that Imperial Treasure’s power can you actually use?”

Boom boom boom boom…

As she spoke, dazzling bursts of light exploded in the sky—countless sword energies clashing with the invisible pressure.

But Yang Kai hadn’t refined the Myriad Sword for long, and his cultivation wasn’t high. So although the sword energies looked fierce, they were hollow inside. As soon as they touched that boundless pressure, they dissipated one after another.

The terrifying pressure continued to descend, directly covering where Yang Kai stood.

“How much power I can use doesn’t matter. What matters is… I never expected that sword to block your divine ability!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly rang out behind the red-clothed woman.

Gripping the sword with both hands, he summoned all his brute strength and slashed fiercely at the red-clothed woman’s slender neck.

The red-clothed woman seemed surprised too, exclaiming, “Teleportation? Space power? Now this is interesting…”

As she spoke, she turned around, smiling at Yang Kai, not dodging in the slightest.

The sword cut straight through her neck, slicing her body in two!

Yet Yang Kai felt no joy at landing a blow—on the contrary, it was as if he’d been stung by a scorpion, and he leapt back!

At the same time, right beside where he’d just been, the red-clothed woman appeared bizarrely, tapping a finger on his afterimage.

“You dodged that too?” The red-clothed woman frowned, murmuring, “This Lord underestimated you…”

As she finished, her expression changed slightly, and she looked around with a frown.

Where she stood, a pitch-black hole appeared, radiating a terrifying devouring force.

On the other side, Yang Kai formed seals with both hands, gritting his teeth and growling, “Banish!”

“With just these tricks…” The red-clothed woman smiled coolly, “you think you can deal with this Lord?”

With a wave of her hand, the black hole vanished.

Yang Kai gave a bitter laugh, standing still and putting away the Myriad Sword.

“What’s this? Giving up already?” The red-clothed woman looked at Yang Kai with interest, mocking him.

“I can’t beat you, so what’s the point?” Yang Kai’s face was calm.

“So you’re ready to die?” The red-clothed woman giggled.

Yang Kai said, “Pointless resistance only brings more pain. Senior, just make it quick… But before that, I want to ask—why are you doing this to me? How have I offended you?”

“Didn’t I tell you… this Lord just finds you an eyesore!” the red-clothed woman replied.

“Crazy woman!” Yang Kai spat through gritted teeth.

“Pfft…” Somewhere in the void, a hidden figure was leisurely sipping tea. Hearing Yang Kai’s words, he spat out his tea, nearly spraying it on the young woman across from him.

The young maiden, unaware of everything else, stared nervously at Yang Kai and the red-clothed woman, anxiously pleading, “Uncle Li, please let me go, alright? I’ll obediently return to the island with you. Why are you making trouble for Eldest Brother Yang? He’s only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—how could he possibly be your match?”

"Not so, not so…" The man the young woman called Uncle Li slowly shook his head, correcting her, "It’s not Uncle Li looking for trouble with that boy. It’s your Aunt Feng. I’m just here drinking tea… it has nothing to do with me…"

“Why! Aunt Feng has never met Eldest Brother Yang, so why is she making trouble for him?” the young woman asked anxiously.

"Xiaoqi…" Uncle Li put on a world-weary look and said earnestly, "The outside world… is very complicated. The men out there are very cunning. Your Aunt Feng… is doing this for your own good!"

Hearing this, Mo Xiaoqi pouted and huffed, “I don’t care! Uncle Li, if you don’t call Aunt Feng back, I’ll… I’ll tell Aunt Feng you peeked at her bathing!”

At this, Uncle Li’s expression changed dramatically, his face turning pale and sweat pouring down his forehead. “Xiaoqi, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want… Uncle Li is upright and proper—when have I ever done such a filthy thing… Well, fine, there was that one time, but I didn’t see anything before you dragged me away! You’ve got a good memory, little girl—you were only four then!”

“Don’t change the subject! I’m asking you—will you or won’t you?” Mo Xiaoqi huffed, “If you dare refuse, I’ll break that story into a dozen pieces and tell Aunt Feng all about it over the next few days…”

“Ancestor, have mercy!” Uncle Li’s face scrunched up like a bitter gourd. “Spare me, will you? There’s no need to make things hard for me…”

“So you agree?” Mo Xiaoqi glared at Uncle Li.

Uncle Li sighed, “If it were before… maybe Uncle Li could have helped you. But now…”

“Now what?”

“That brat dared call your Aunt Feng a crazy woman—he’s dead for sure!” Uncle Li gloated.

“Ah… no!” Mo Xiaoqi jumped in fright, turning to look—sure enough, she saw Aunt Feng burning with anger, cold light flashing in her beautiful eyes. That was a sign Aunt Feng was truly angry, and Mo Xiaoqi feared nothing more than seeing her like this.

“Boy, what did you just say?” The red-clothed woman seemed to smile sweetly, but Yang Kai could feel the bone-chilling cold in her words.

Things had come to this, and Yang Kai was ready to risk it all. If this woman really dared to kill him, he’d just undo the gold and silver seal on his abdomen and give her a big surprise! Even if he couldn’t win, he might be able to escape… though he wasn’t sure.

The only problem was, he wouldn’t have the strength to seal the demonic intent and boundless Demonic Qi again.

The sealing power within the Firmament Tree also needed time to accumulate.

"Crazy woman!" Yang Kai tilted his chin up, fixing the red-clothed woman with a hard, unyielding stare.

“Heh…” The red-clad woman laughed instead of growing angry; in the next instant, her voice sharpened like a blade: “Believe it or not, I’ll kill you right now.”

Yang Kai raised his brows in surprise. “Oh? So you don’t actually want to kill me?”

His expression eased, and he chuckled, “That makes me wonder—you’re a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, yet instead of minding your affairs you came here just to block my way. What exactly are you after? I’ve never even met you; there’s no deep grudge between us.”

The red-clad woman let out a cold laugh and said, “Thinking yourself clever, are you?”

But Yang Kai’s next words made her expression change.

“Greetings, Aunt Feng!”

A look of astonishment instantly appeared on the red-clothed woman’s face. She never expected Yang Kai to call out her identity in one go.

She quickly looked toward a certain spot in the void where Uncle Li had spread his hands, indicating it had nothing to do with him.

"You’re Aunt Feng, aren’t you?" Yang Kai asked, but his tone was almost certain. He also glanced at the spot the red-clothed woman had just looked at, waved at the void, and called out with a smile, "Xiaoqi!"
