## Chapter 2571 — Struck It Rich

The Myriad Beasts Seal possessed an obvious and powerful restraining force against beast souls. No matter their strength or size, once the Myriad Beasts Seal locked onto them, they could no longer break free, and were all drawn into the seal, vanishing without a trace.

Yang Kai clearly saw several beast souls, each comparable to Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beasts, being dragged inside.

Ruoxi was about to make a fortune. Once they left this place, who knew how much the power of the Myriad Beasts Seal would increase?

Yet as Yang Kai pondered further, his expression darkened. This was the Tomb of All Spirits—he still had no idea how to escape from this place, nor did he know if tearing open space would even work here.

Crash...

The countless beast souls collided and ricocheted within the bone mountain, shattering it into fragments. Bone after bone crumbled into powder, scattering like white dust into the air.

A dim yellow light suddenly caught Yang Kai’s eye. Curious, he reached out and grabbed the glowing object. It was cool and round in his hand, and a decent energy fluctuation immediately flowed into him.

“Inner Core!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up in surprise.

It turned out to be the Inner Core of a Demonic Beast, and judging by the energy, it seemed to be a Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast’s Inner Core.

He stood there in a daze for a moment, then, as if struck by an idea, he became incredibly excited. With a wave of his sleeve, a fierce wind suddenly swept forth.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh...

The bone mountain collapsed, countless beast bones turned to flying ash, scattering in all directions. It was as if a white storm had erupted on the spot. At the very center of the storm, a clearing about ten zhang wide remained, and dozens of Inner Cores of various colors lay scattered across the ground.

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai couldn’t help but burst out laughing, gazing at the dozens of Inner Cores on the ground, laughing so hard that tears nearly streamed from his eyes.

Zhang Ruoxi, though focused on sealing beast souls, noticed Yang Kai’s actions. Seeing this, she called out, “Sir, could it be that the Inner Cores of those Demonic Beasts remain here after their deaths?”

“It must be so. Ruoxi, we’ve struck it rich!” Yang Kai replied cheerfully, then with a wave of his hand, summoned the dozens of Inner Cores through the air and collected them.

These dozens of Inner Cores varied in quality, but even the lowest were Ninth-Tier, and the highest reached Twelfth-Tier.

Countless Demonic Beasts died in the Tomb of All Spirits. Their souls became beast souls guarding this place, their bodies faded into light and vanished, but their Inner Cores remained perfectly intact.

The number of beast souls was incalculable, and likewise, the number of Inner Cores here was beyond measure!

Demonic Beast Inner Cores had many uses, most commonly in alchemy. Many Spiritual Pills required Demonic Beast Inner Cores as auxiliary ingredients. Yang Kai had accumulated plenty of Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines; if he could obtain enough Inner Cores here, he’d have far more options when refining Spiritual Pills.

Just moments ago, Yang Kai had thought Zhang Ruoxi was the only one to stumble upon a great opportunity here—who could have guessed that in the blink of an eye, fortune would smile upon him as well?

If he could sweep up all the Inner Cores in this graveyard, what a massive fortune that would be! Even the Great Emperors would be envious.

After collecting the dozens of Inner Cores, Yang Kai swept his hand again, clearing away nearby bones. Instantly, dozens more Inner Cores of varying quality appeared on the ground.

Zhang Ruoxi worked hard to seal beast souls, while Yang Kai diligently gathered Inner Cores. Each performed their duties without interfering with the other. Their cooperation was seamless.

At first, Yang Kai would clear away the bones, but soon found it troublesome. He simply released his Divine Sense to search for the locations of the Inner Cores, then sent out Golden Blood Threads to retrieve them from beneath the bones, sparing the area from becoming a mess.

The efficiency improved greatly.

In just a short while, Zhang Ruoxi had sealed all the nearby beast souls, and Yang Kai had scoured the ground within a radius of over ten li for Inner Cores. Though he didn’t count them, there were at least ten thousand.

Among these ten thousand Inner Cores, even if Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast Inner Cores made up only one percent, that was still over a hundred Twelfth-Tier Inner Cores, each worth a fortune.

“Let’s find another spot!”

The area was empty now, with no beast souls or Inner Cores left. Yang Kai immediately pulled Zhang Ruoxi along to relocate. As for how to leave... it could wait until they’d gathered enough benefits.

On another bone mountain, Zhang Ruoxi summoned the Myriad Beasts Seal, while Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to search for Inner Cores hidden beneath the bones.

In less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, the area was cleared again. Without further words, Yang Kai wrapped Zhang Ruoxi up and moved on.

As they swept through the place, beast souls were sealed by Zhang Ruoxi, Inner Cores were scoured by Yang Kai, and the Tomb of All Spirits, since its creation, was likely experiencing such a calamity for the first time.

This was nothing short of a plundering!

If the four Divine Spirits of the Wild Ancient Land knew about this, who could say what they’d think?

There were no sun, moon, or stars here, no distinction between night and day, but Yang Kai estimated that he and Zhang Ruoxi had spent about three days in this place, nearly covering the entire graveyard.

This was likely an isolated small world, not too large. The two spent three days sealing beast souls and collecting Inner Cores, but if they exerted themselves and flew at full speed, they could probably traverse the graveyard in less than an hour.

The harvest was unimaginable.

The Myriad Beasts Seal now radiated an eerie, chilling aura, its surface growing ever darker and more ominous. Even without being activated, its overwhelming power was palpable. According to Zhang Ruoxi, the seal was nearly full—within it, at least several hundred thousand beast souls were imprisoned, and this didn’t include those devoured by the Soul-Devouring Worms.

The Soul-Devouring Worms had also feasted these past few days. Most of the beast souls were sealed by Zhang Ruoxi, while the rest were devoured by the worms. Now, the Soul-Devouring Worms conveyed a lazy mood to Yang Kai, as if they were about to fall asleep.

Yang Kai knew this was a sign of their impending evolution, and he was delighted.

The number of Inner Cores Yang Kai obtained was well over a million. In the Small Xuan Realm, the Inner Cores nearly formed a small mountain, ranging from Ninth-Tier to Twelfth-Tier.

Such a vast collection of Inner Cores could not be consumed by any single force. Even a Sect founded by a Great Emperor wouldn’t have the resources.

After another sweep through the Tomb of All Spirits, confirming there were few stragglers left, Yang Kai finally stopped and turned to look in a certain direction.

“Sir, are we heading that way?” Zhang Ruoxi put away the Myriad Beasts Seal and stood gracefully at his side.

Over the past few days, the two had searched the entire graveyard, but found no exit or trace of the Third Disciple. If there was an exit, it could only be in that direction, since there were no Demonic Beast bones there, so they hadn’t checked it before.

That should be the center of the Tomb of All Spirits. All the Demonic Beasts that came here to die formed a circle around the central area, leaving a vast empty space.

Previously, Yang Kai had been busy collecting the Inner Cores and hadn’t paid much attention to that area.

Now he had to take a look. If the Third Disciple was still here, she would surely be in the central area. He didn’t know if she was alive or dead.

Nodding, Yang Kai moved forward, with Zhang Ruoxi quickly following.

Passing through the bone mountains, they soon arrived at the empty area. In the distance, a faint gray-black light flickered. Yang Kai squinted, focusing his gaze.

After a moment, his expression brightened.

That gray-black light was actually the shape of the tomb gate he’d seen before.

That might really be the exit. If they could leave through there, there’d be no need to use the Power of Space to tear open a passage, which would be troublesome, and Yang Kai wasn’t confident he could tear open the boundary of a small world.

Their speed suddenly increased, but halfway there, Yang Kai abruptly stopped and looked down.

Zhang Ruoxi’s beautiful eyes widened in astonishment.

Because from somewhere below, an incredibly fierce aura surged upward, its source none other than a gaunt, skin-and-bones figure.

The figure was disheveled and miserable, but clearly still alive. Black energy coiled around the frail body, and points of glowing light constantly drifted away.

“A yao!” Zhang Ruoxi exclaimed softly, instantly recognizing the creature as a member of the yao race—and a powerful one at that.

“A Yao King!” Yang Kai added, shocked.

He didn’t know how this Yao King ended up here, since this area didn’t seem like a place for yao to tread. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be so empty—it would have been filled with bones long ago.

Moreover, this Yao King was clearly not dead, struggling to resist the loss of his life force. Judging by his appearance, he wouldn’t last much longer.

No wonder Yang Youwei had said that even the strongest Yao King entering the Tomb of All Spirits would face certain death. This Yao King was proof. To become a Yao King, a yao had to be a peak expert comparable to the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, but even so, they couldn’t escape this place.

After hesitating, Yang Kai flashed to stand before the Yao King.

The Yao King was clearly startled, his skin-and-bones body trembling. He finally looked up at Yang Kai.

His eye sockets were deep, his gaze dull—he was truly at the end of his strength.

“Another human...” The Yao King’s mouth moved, and his cloudy eyes showed surprise.

Yang Kai raised his brows, catching the implication, and asked, “You’ve seen others come here before?”

The Yao King, though dying, was extremely proud. He grinned coldly, forcing out a smile uglier than crying: “Why should I tell you?”

Yang Kai’s gaze flickered. Pointing at the light gate, he said, “I’ll be leaving through there soon. If you want to live, I can take you with me!”

The proud Yao King was suddenly unsettled. His dull eyes burst with brilliance, his face eager, but soon the excitement faded. He snorted, “Are you really so kind?”

Yang Kai replied calmly, “Just mutual benefit. As long as you tell me what I want to know, saving your life is no trouble.”
