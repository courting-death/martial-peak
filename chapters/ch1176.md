## Chapter 1176 — Capable People Prefer to Work Alone

After walking a good distance, the man who had invited Yang Kai to travel together glanced back, his expression strange as he muttered, "A First Stage of the Saint King Realm can stand here without Saint Yuan protecting him? Truly odd."

Even he, a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, found it somewhat taxing; sweat quickly soaked his clothes, yet he noticed Yang Kai wasn't nearly so bedraggled, which prompted his invitation.

He had instinctively felt that Yang Kai was not ordinary.

But the other person had seemed a little aloof, and he wisely refrained from pressing the matter—here, loose words invite disaster. Better to be careful; who knew what sort of temper that First Stage of the Saint King Realm had? If he angered the man and a fight broke out, that would be troublesome. The Flowing Flame Sandland only opens once every four hundred years; it's full of treasures, so it was best to hurry and seek advantage.

After the man left, Yang Kai stood where he was for a moment; the voice that had invited him sounded oddly familiar, as if he'd heard it somewhere before, though Yang Kai was certain he'd never met the man.

How could he have heard the voice of someone he'd never seen?

After a brief ponder, Yang Kai didn't dwell on the question; he took the Yuan Magnetic Pointer from his Spatial Ring.

The Communication Compass kept with the Yuan Magnetic Pointer gave off some Divine Sense fluctuations—likely a message from Wei Guchang. Yang Kai pulled it out to sense it and found he was right: not only was there Wei Guchang's transmission, but Divine Senses from Xuan'er and several other Yingyue Hall disciples flickered within, asking one another their positions and setting a rendezvous point.

Yang Kai ignored it, tossed the Communication Compass back into his Spatial Ring, then used the Yuan Magnetic Pointer to confirm direction and headed deeper into the Flowing Flame Sandland.

About three hundred li from Yang Kai, Wei Guchang stood beneath a huge rampart. The slope was conspicuous—its silhouette visible even from a great distance. He and a few Core Disciples of Yingyue Hall had agreed to meet there; those people weren't fools and should find the place quickly.

Xuan'er, who was closest to him, arrived first within the space of half a tea after the transmission.

"Senior Brother!" Xuan'er called happily as she approached, a faint blue aura surrounding her. A ring of light wrapped her, exuding a chill that kept the heat at bay—the protection of the Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure Yang Yan had forged for her.

Wei Guchang, like Yang Kai, did not immediately use a Secret Treasure or Saint Yuan for protection. He stood amid the steaming heat as if he enjoyed the roasting, and when he saw Xuan'er arrive his face broke into a warm smile.

"Senior Brother, the juniors who planned to enter the heaven-and-earth treasure area have all replied back, but Senior Brother Yang hasn't sent anything—perhaps he's too far away. Has he exceeded the Communication Compass's range?" Xuan'er asked with concern.

"Not likely." Wei Guchang shook his head. "Our Communication Compass was personally forged by Master Gelin; its transmission reaches five hundred li. We entered at roughly the same time. Even if scattered, they should be nearby. Brother Yang didn't reply… he probably has his own plan."

"You mean Senior Brother Yang intends to act alone? He won't join us?" Xuan'er—gentle and perceptive—immediately understood Yang Kai's intent.

"People with ability all like to work alone!" Wei Guchang grinned broadly.

"What about you, Senior Brother? Don't you want to act alone, free and unbound?" Xuan'er suddenly asked softly.

Wei Guchang laughed heartily. "Of course I want to go with you—just the two of us, love that blooms beneath moonlight, roaming this forbidden land together—how delightful!"

Hearing his nonsense, Xuan'er couldn't help but click her tongue, yet a blissful smile still bloomed on her face.

Wei Guchang snorted coldly. "If it were possible, I'd prefer just the two of us, but Senior Uncle Wang and Senior Uncle Yan specially instructed me to look after the juniors; I can't abandon them. Ridiculous—when I invited Brother Yang earlier, they seemed displeased. They have no idea how formidable Brother Yang is. I'd rather pair with Brother Yang than bring along those burdens."

"Life in a Sect has its frustrations; Senior Brother, don't take it too much to heart," Xuan'er soothed.

That was her greatest virtue and what Wei Guchang liked most about her—always able to say the right thing at the right time to comfort him. Whenever he was in a bad mood, a few words from her would immediately calm him.

"I know. Enough of this. They'll be here soon; if they overhear it'd be embarrassing." Wei Guchang smiled and shook his head, dropping the subject and discussing the route and direction they'd advance with Xuan'er.

At that moment, Yang Kai encountered his first Fire Spirit Beast.

He had assumed a Fire Spirit Beast would be as easy to spot as a demonic beast, and since entering he'd been searching around to see what oddities the Flowing Flame Sandland held and to examine what was special about the Crystal Stone.

Unexpectedly, he could find no trace. Just as he scanned the area, a fissure in the ground suddenly gushed firelight, and a tiger-shaped Fire Spirit Beast shook its head and tail as it emerged.

Yang Kai did not rush to strike; he observed carefully.

As Wei Guchang had said, the Fire Spirit Beast's body seemed half-illusory and ever-changing, extremely strange. Its aura was perfectly concealed by the Heat-Flame Zone's heat, so even though Yang Kai remained vigilant, he had not noticed it until it leaped from the crack beneath his feet.

The tiger-like Fire Spirit Beast looked frail—only the caliber of a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, equivalent to a cultivator of the Divine Roaming Realm. It lacked a full body: a majestic tiger head and a sturdy half-torso remained; below the waist there was only a mass of firelight.

Yang Kai was greatly disappointed, but the beast ignorantly launched an attack. He threw a single punch; Saint Yuan burst forth from his fist and tore it apart.

The firelight exploded; the tiger-shaped Fire Spirit Beast vanished instantly, and a dark-red, sand-grain-sized object fell from the air.

Yang Kai casually scooped it up and held it in his hand.

Is this the Crystal Stone? Even at first glance Yang Kai recognized this must be the Crystal Stone Wei Guchang had been so taken with.

But it was tiny. Although the Spiritual Qi inside was pure, the quantity was meager. Yang Kai casually circulated Saint Yuan and drained its internal energy completely.

Slightly dissatisfied, he shook his head. Yang Kai guessed the Crystal Stone's size was directly tied to the Fire Spirit Beast's rank.

The higher the Fire Spirit Beast's rank, the larger the Crystal Stone would be; these sand-grain-sized Crystal Stones were crystallizations from Fifth-Tier Fire Spirit Beasts—Sixth-, Seventh-, even Eighth-Tier ones would likely differ.

The outermost Heat-Flame Zone offered no real challenge, and Yang Kai had lost interest in careful inspection. He put thought into action: with the roar of wind and thunder, a magnificent pair of wings unfurled from his back—half-transparent, threaded with arcs of electricity—the Wind-and-Thunder Wings he had not used in ages.

On the Tongxuan Continent the Wind-and-Thunder Wings had aided him greatly, but after obtaining the Star Shuttle Secret Treasure their usefulness had waned.

In the Star Domain he had not used the Wind-and-Thunder Wings at all.

He hadn’t expected that in a place like this, there would actually be a need to test it.

He poured Saint Yuan into the Wind-and-Thunder Wings; wind screamed and thunder rolled, and Yang Kai's speed shot up as he became a streak of light.

Yang Kai's face brightened—his guess had been correct. Although the Star Shuttle couldn't be used inside the Flowing Flame Sandland and cultivators couldn't fly freely, the Wind-and-Thunder Wings were not heavily restricted so long as one did not leave the ground.

The instant Yang Kai tried to leave the ground, a crushing pressure descended from the sky and forced him back down.

After testing a few times, Yang Kai honestly relied on the Wind-and-Thunder Wings' assistance while keeping both feet on the ground.

This Forbidden Land was strange; who knew what wondrous heavenly laws it harbored—there were simply many restrictions here.

Traveling on, Yang Kai did not meet a single person; it felt as though he alone explored the vast Flowing Flame Sandland. He knew this was only an illusion—the Sandland was enormous, composed of concentric circular zones; the farther out one went the wider the circumference, so encounters were rarer. But as one moved inward and elites gathered toward the center, the chance of meeting others would increase, and conflicts would likely multiply.

Fire Spirit Beasts indeed abounded in the Heat-Flame Zone. As Yang Kai traveled, one or two Fire Spirit Beasts of varying ranks would occasionally burst from fissures to hinder him, and some would swagger across the surface, wandering about.

For these Fifth- and Sixth-Tier Fire Spirit Beasts, Yang Kai had no interest in slaying them; he ignored them and sped away.

The farther he went, the higher the temperature rose; not only did the heat sting his skin, but the fire-toxin carried in the heat intensified, silently seeping into his body through his pores and affecting his bodily functions and the circulation of Saint Yuan.

This fire-toxin was brutally domineering—no matter how he circulated his techniques, Yang Kai couldn't dissolve it. If it accumulated, it would pose a grave danger to anyone; he could only forcibly expel it from his body.

As the heat rose and the fire-toxin ravaged him, Yang Kai had to muster Saint Yuan to guard his body, resisting the heat while fending off the toxin's invasion.
