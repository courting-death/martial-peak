## Chapter 2529 — Desolate City

Since there was no way to take away the remaining twenty-some stalks of Spiritual Herbs, he might as well move both of these medicine gardens in their entirety!

Such a crazy idea could only be accomplished by Yang Kai, because he possessed the Xuan Realm Pearl, which could contain both medicine gardens.

Anyone else who came here could only look on in despair.

Rumble rumble...

Wrapped in Divine Sense, the two medicine gardens soared into the air like two tiny floating islands. Immediately after, Yang Kai opened the entrance to the Xuan Realm Pearl and tossed the gardens inside, placing them next to his own medicine garden.

After probing with his Divine Sense and confirming that the twenty-some stalks of Spiritual Herbs were undamaged and showed no signs of withering, Yang Kai finally relaxed.

But Yang Kai wasn’t done yet. He glanced around, and simply disregarding the cost of his strength, spent another half a day moving all the remaining dozen or so medicine gardens here into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

This ancient medicine garden could nurture so many ten-thousand-year-old Spiritual Herbs, likely because of some mysterious quality hidden in the earth. Such land was naturally extremely fertile. By moving them into his Xuan Realm Pearl, Yang Kai could expand his own medicine garden, and in the future, transplanted flowers and exotic herbs would have a much higher survival rate.

After finishing all this, Yang Kai carefully inspected the ancient medicine garden again, making sure nothing was left behind, and only then did he leave with Zhang Ruoxi.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

On a wooden boat, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi sped along at full speed.

The land in all directions was barren and desolate, with not a single sign of life for a hundred miles around.

The further they traveled, the sparser the population became. At first, they would occasionally see a few cities, but the further they went, the longer they could fly without seeing a single soul.

Zhang Ruoxi didn’t know where Yang Kai was headed. But she didn’t ask much, simply following quietly at his side, using her free time to refine the Myriad Beasts Seal. Time passed quickly this way.

One day, a ruined city suddenly appeared below. The city looked extremely odd, as if it had been thrown together haphazardly. The whole place was a chaotic mess, with no sense of beauty at all. The buildings within the city were scattered randomly, here and there with no order.

Yet despite its dilapidated appearance, the city was bustling inside. Many cultivators hurried through the streets, each with a fierce and unapproachable aura.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai directly guided the wooden boat down toward the city.

Before long, he and Zhang Ruoxi entered it.

This city didn’t seem to have a name. There were plenty of cultivators coming and going, but all of them moved with haste.

On both sides of the narrow alleys, countless vendors had set up stalls, shouting loudly to attract the attention of passersby.

As soon as they entered the city, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi’s ears were filled with all kinds of hawking cries.

“Imperial-Grade material, Taiyin Purple Jade! The perfect material for nurturing an Imperial Treasure. Don’t miss out, come take a look!”

“Imperial-Grade Upper-Level Spiritual Herb, Xuanming Ningshen Grass! Even if you don’t refine it into a pill, just consuming it directly is greatly beneficial for the Divine Soul. Only trading, not selling—serious inquiries only!”

“A thousand years ago, the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert, Sect Master Duan Santai of the Mountain Sect, left behind his unique cultivation art: the Indestructible Vajra Technique! Cultivate this art to forge a Golden Body—indestructible and immortal! Selling cheap! Only ten million Middle-Level Source Crystals! I risked my life to bring this out of the Ancient Land. Miss this chance and you won’t get another!”

“What? Who says my goods are fake? Come on, say it louder! I guarantee I won’t beat you to death!”

“Location of a Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast, a six-tailed spirit fox cub! This beast has the bloodline of the Divine Spirit Nine-Tailed Spirit Fox. Anyone interested in taming it can talk to me—I offer paid guide services!”

“...”

Zhang Ruoxi’s beautiful eyes widened as she looked around. Everything here filled her with curiosity.

After watching for a while, she tugged on Yang Kai’s sleeve and whispered, “Sir, what is this place? Why are there so many Imperial-Grade materials for sale, and even people selling peerless cultivation arts and Demonic Beast cub locations? And what is this Ancient Land they keep mentioning?”

Selling Imperial-Grade materials was one thing, but to see cultivation arts and cub locations for sale as well—this was simply too strange.

However, after listening for a while, Zhang Ruoxi understood a bit. The things sold here all seemed to come from a place called the Ancient Land. Those selling Demonic Beast cub locations were also offering to guide people there to tame them.

Though the city was chaotic, it was extremely lively. Looking around, Zhang Ruoxi noticed that almost all the cultivators here were at least Dao Origin Realm and above. There were very few below Dao Origin Realm.

She even saw several experts brushing past her, each exuding the aura of the Emperor Realm.

What kind of place could attract so many powerful experts? What was the allure of this place?

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, “This is near the Wild Ancient Land. That is the Ancient Land they’re talking about.”

“Wild Ancient Land?” Zhang Ruoxi was stunned, clearly having never heard of it before.

Yang Kai said, “I don’t know much about the Wild Ancient Land either, but I’ve heard it’s an uncharted region filled with countless powerful Demonic Beasts, even Divine Spirits, and many deadly dangers. Even Emperor Realm cultivators can’t guarantee their safety there.”

“It’s so dangerous, yet so many people go in. There must be a lot of good things inside!” Zhang Ruoxi immediately grasped the key point.

Yang Kai laughed, “The world bustles for profit, and people come and go for gain. Without benefit, how could so many experts be drawn here? The Wild Ancient Land is dangerous, but its resources are extremely abundant. Most of the things sold here carry a trace of the Primordial Aura, and should have been found in the Ancient Land. Even the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor’s Mountain and River Bell was brought out from the Wild Ancient Land.”

“Mountain and River Bell!” Zhang Ruoxi’s eyes lit up, her expression excited. She had participated in the Shattered Star Sea trial and naturally heard of the Mountain and River Bell’s fame, though she didn’t know it was now in Yang Kai’s possession.

Taking a deep breath, she asked, “Sir, are you planning to enter the Ancient Land?”

Yang Kai nodded, “That’s right. I came here for the Wild Ancient Land.”

According to the information provided by Yin Lesheng, Xiaoxiao had indeed been teleported to the Eastern Territory with him back then. But Yin Lesheng was injured at the time and knew he wasn’t Xiaoxiao’s match, so he didn’t dare cause trouble, only following from a distance to see if he could find a chance to subdue that strange creature.

Who could have expected that Xiaoxiao would head straight into the Wild Ancient Land?

At that time, Yin Lesheng didn’t know about the Wild Ancient Land, but instinctively sensed the danger inside, so he had no choice but to give up and leave.

After that, he never saw Xiaoxiao again.

If what he said was true, then Xiaoxiao should still be in the Wild Ancient Land, though whether alive or dead was unknown.

And under the binding force of the Soul Contract, Yang Kai figured Yin Lesheng wouldn’t lie—unless he had some secret art to evade the Soul Contract’s punishment.

No matter what, Yang Kai had to make a trip to the Wild Ancient Land.

Yang Kai didn’t know much about the Wild Ancient Land. If he didn't have to come to the Eastern Territory, he might never have even heard of such a place. So, before venturing in, he definitely needed to find someone to gather information.

Originally, Yang Kai had a suitable candidate: Qi Hai from the Qi Family Fort!

In the Shattered Star Sea, this man had earnestly invited Yang Kai to visit Qi Family Fort, which was near the Wild Ancient Land. As a member of the Qi Family, Qi Hai surely knew a lot about the Wild Ancient Land, including many secrets unknown to outsiders.

With his help, Yang Kai figured his chances of safely entering the Wild Ancient Land would increase severalfold.

Unfortunately... the main reason Qi Hai invited Yang Kai was the True Phoenix Fire.

Qi Hai’s wife had been poisoned by one of the Ten Great Deadly Poisons, Heavenly Frost Earth Drizzle, while training in the Wild Ancient Land. She was on the verge of death, and only the nirvana power within the True Phoenix Fire could bring her back to life.

Qi Hai entered the Shattered Star Sea mainly to search for the True Phoenix Fire, hoping to subdue it and save his wife, but he didn’t have the fortune for it.

Now, the True Phoenix Fire was being refined by Liu Yan, and Liu Yan had been taken to the Spirit Beast Island by Jiu Feng. Naturally, Yang Kai couldn’t ask Qi Hai for help, lest things become awkward if they met.

Qi Hai thought it was simple—just get the True Phoenix Fire and he could save his wife. But he didn’t know that refining the True Phoenix Fire was extremely dangerous and took a very long time.

Just as Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi were talking, a man with a weasel-like face, squinting eyes, and a glint of cunning suddenly sidled up to Yang Kai and whispered, “Friend, I have an Imperial-Grade Spirit Fruit, a Nine Heavens Cloud Fruit, for cheap. Interested?”

As he spoke, he flipped his palm, revealing a bright red fruit radiating a strong Spiritual Qi fluctuation. But in the blink of an eye, he put it away again.

The powerful Spiritual Qi fluctuation startled the nearby cultivators, who all turned to look over.

However, a few stall owners glanced over and showed strange expressions before quickly looking away.

“Nine Heavens Cloud Fruit?” Yang Kai’s lips curled into a meaningful smile.

Zhang Ruoxi frowned and quietly stepped back. Not only was this man’s clothing filthy, but he also reeked as if he hadn’t bathed in ages. Even worse, when he spoke, he revealed a mouthful of yellow teeth—utterly disgusting.

“Do you want it or not?” the man asked in a low voice, as if afraid of being overheard. “I risked my life to pick this from the Ancient Land. There was even a Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast guarding it.”

“A Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast guarding it...” Yang Kai was speechless.

With his eye as an Imperial-Grade Alchemist, he could instantly tell that the so-called Nine Heavens Cloud Fruit was a fake. The real one was indeed an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Medicine and extremely rare, but its Spiritual Qi was restrained, never radiating such a strong fluctuation.

The only beast that guarded the Nine Heavens Cloud Fruit was the Nine Heavens Thunder Python, which was indeed Twelfth-Tier. But with this man’s First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, if he really encountered a Nine Heavens Thunder Python, he’d be eaten without a trace—how could he possibly have made it back alive?
