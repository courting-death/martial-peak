## Chapter 2151 — Qiankun Shifting Divine Art

The one speaking was Murong Xiaoxiao. At this moment, she looked up at the sky, pointing upward, her small mouth slightly open, her face full of astonishment.

Following her direction, everyone looked up, and in an instant, they were all dumbfounded.

They saw streaks of flowing light tearing across the sky, like meteors falling from above, trailing long, brilliant tails as they crashed downward.

At first, there were only a few streaks, but soon, their number increased, and at a glance, it looked as if a meteor shower was raining down from the heavens.

"Star Seals!" Lan Xun exclaimed in shock, her voice crisp: "So many Star Seals?"

"What?" Xiao Chen was startled at her words, "Princess, are you sure all of those are Star Seals?"

Lan Xun focused on the sky, perhaps using some secret technique, her eyes faintly shining as she nodded gently: "No mistake, they're all Star Seals!"

As soon as she finished speaking, a soft whooshing sound came from the side.

Everyone looked over and saw Wuchang's entire body transformed into red and white light, swiftly chasing after the falling Star Seals.

He was quick to act. As soon as he heard they were Star Seals, he moved.

After him, Luo Yuan's figure flickered and followed close behind.

"Go!" Xiao Baiyi naturally wouldn't fall behind. With a low shout, he and Murong Xiaoxiao hurried to catch up.

They had already been in the Four Seasons Land for two or three days, and had only encountered one Star Seal in Two Seasons Mountain. That Star Seal was branded on the forehead of a giant demonic beast, which they wounded heavily. But in the end, Yang Kai picked it up, and Luo Yuan and Wuchang nearly fought over it.

Now, with so many Star Seals appearing, even if they were divided among everyone present, each person could get six or seven.

A single Star Seal is a token to enter the Shattered Star Sea, which means a great deal to any sect!

Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao dared not delay.

"Princess..." Seeing everyone rush off, Xiao Chen grew anxious.

"Let's go too!" Lan Xun naturally wouldn't miss such a good opportunity and answered immediately.

Xiao Chen nodded, and together with Lan Xun, they sped off in that direction.

But just as the two set off, a wooden boat-like Secret Treasure flew alongside them.

Lan Xun turned her head and saw Yang Kai standing calmly on the boat, striking a graceful pose. The wind swept his black hair back...

Lan Xun couldn't help but snicker. At this moment, Yang Kai's image was completely different from his previous timid self, as if he was trying to attract her attention.

She understood Yang Kai's behavior well. Few men could maintain their true selves in front of her; they always tried to catch her eye, as if it gave them some satisfaction.

"Hmph!" Xiao Chen snorted coldly, looking displeased.

He had long disliked Yang Kai, and now this guy was shamelessly pretending to be suave, which was intolerable.

Yang Kai seemed not to notice his attitude, feigning puzzlement as he asked Lan Xun, "Miss, why does your friend call you Princess? Is that your title or something?"

"Whose title would include the word Princess?" Lan Xun smiled and shook her head. "You're overthinking it."

"Then... I don't get it." Yang Kai shook his head, "You have an extraordinary bearing and elegant manners, clearly of noble birth and well taught, but... what does that have to do with being a Princess? Could you enlighten me?"

Lan Xun frowned slightly, a bit troubled. She couldn't just tell Yang Kai she was the daughter of the Radiant Moon Emperor, which is why she's called Princess. That would sound boastful, even if it was true.

So she asked in return, "I come from Star God Palace, can't you guess?"

She thought anyone with some common sense would connect the dots after hearing that, saving her from having to explain.

But to her surprise, Yang Kai pondered for a while and then seriously shook his head.

Xiao Chen couldn't stand Yang Kai's ignorance and couldn't help but snort, "Star God Palace was founded by the Radiant Moon Emperor. The lady before you is his precious daughter!"

"Ah?" Yang Kai was shocked, stammering, "So you... you're the Emperor's daughter?" He looked utterly astonished...

"One's birth doesn't mean much." Lan Xun smiled faintly, her demeanor still amiable.

But Xiao Chen couldn't help but curse, "What kind of bumpkin hasn't even heard of Princess, yet managed to enter the Four Seasons Land? He's a disgrace to our kind. Princess, don't bother with him!"

Yang Kai said awkwardly, "I used to cultivate deep in the mountains and only recently came out to train, so I don't know much about the outside world... Heh, but I've heard of the Radiant Moon Emperor."

"I see..." Lan Xun didn't show whether she believed him, her expression unreadable. "Looks like you're the type who trains hard in seclusion, so it's normal not to know much about the outside."

"Princess, you're too kind. I'm just ignorant," Yang Kai said humbly, scratching his cheek.

"At least you know your limits!" Xiao Chen added.

"By the way, what's your name?" Lan Xun asked.

Xiao Chen said, "Princess, why ask this bumpkin's name? Don't dirty your ears!"

"What's wrong with asking?" Lan Xun frowned, clearly annoyed by Xiao Chen's meddling. If the Radiant Moon Emperor hadn't personally instructed her before leaving, she wouldn't have stayed with Xiao Chen and would have gone off on her own. For her, nothing was more enjoyable than adventuring alone—the thrill and unknown dangers were irresistible.

"I am Yang Kai."

Lan Xun nodded, suddenly smiling, and said, "There's something I don't understand. Would Brother Yang be willing to enlighten me?"

Yang Kai's eyes flickered. He chuckled, "Princess, if you have any questions, just ask. I'll answer everything I can!"

Lan Xun said, "Brother Yang, don't be so sure. What if my question concerns your secrets...?"

"Hmph, playing hard to get! If it were a man trying to win your favor, he'd already be beating his chest to let you ask anything... Little girl, you're not easy to deal with!" Yang Kai thought to himself, vaguely guessing what Lan Xun wanted to ask. So he said confidently, "Princess, if you want to ask me something, that's giving me face. What's there I can't say?"

Hearing this, Xiao Chen felt uneasy. This bumpkin called Yang Kai might be a wild kid from the mountains, but he seemed to understand women well—he was already chatting so easily with the Princess! How could this be tolerated? Most importantly, the Princess, who never gave men the time of day, was smiling at him the whole time!

Xiao Chen suddenly felt a sense of crisis, so he shot Yang Kai a threatening look, as if to say, "If you keep talking, you'll regret it."

Because of their positions and angles, Lan Xun didn't notice this, but it was clearly conveyed to Yang Kai.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai didn't even glance at him, as if he was completely captivated by Lan Xun, focusing all his attention on the Princess.

Xiao Chen felt as if he'd punched a pile of cotton—completely powerless...

"Earlier, those two attacked you together. How did you escape danger?" Lan Xun asked directly.

As she said, this question definitely touched on Yang Kai's secret. For someone at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to escape unharmed from two Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts, he must have used some astonishing secret art, which couldn't be casually revealed.

So as soon as Lan Xun asked, Yang Kai looked troubled, gave an awkward smile, and stammered, "Well... haha... actually..."

"If you can't say, forget it. Pretend I didn't ask," Lan Xun said.

It sounded considerate, but was actually another move to play hard to get!

With Yang Kai so captivated by Lan Xun, he could only think with his body. How could he bear to refuse her question? Normally, even if he didn't want to answer, he'd have to.

So he sighed and said, "It's not that I can't say. But..."

At this point, he suddenly put on a solemn expression, lowered his voice, and said, "Princess, please keep this secret for me. If this secret art gets out, it won't work anymore. Next time I encounter this situation, I'll surely die."

As he spoke, he leaned closer to Lan Xun, nearly pressing his mouth to her ear.

A delicate fragrance immediately filled his nose.

The two were so close that Lan Xun didn't know whether to dodge or not, and her exquisite ears turned red.

"What are you doing?" Xiao Chen couldn't stand it any longer; he shouted and drew his sword, pointing it at Yang Kai across from Lan Xun.

Yang Kai jumped in fright, quickly backed away, and said innocently, "I didn't do anything. Brother, what do you mean by this?"

"You just..." Xiao Chen started, but couldn't finish. Yang Kai had only gotten a bit close to Lan Xun and hadn't actually done anything, so pursuing it would make him look petty. He could only snort, "Just stand there and talk. If you come any closer, I'll take your head!"

Yang Kai said in surprise, "You're really strange... Fine, I'll stand here. Princess, to be clear, my secret art is called Qiankun Shifting Divine Art. Once activated, it lets me use force against force, letting the weak overcome the strong."

"Use force against force?" Lan Xun looked surprised.

"That's right," Yang Kai nodded seriously. "Earlier, those two attacked me from front and back, which fit the requirements for the Qiankun Shifting Divine Art, so I..." Yang Kai chuckled, drew a half-circle with his hand, "just guided them a bit, and made them attack each other."

Lan Xun mused, "So if only one person attacked you then..."

"I'd be dead for sure!" Yang Kai spread his hands.
