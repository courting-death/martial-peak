## Chapter 2381 — The Method to Leave

"What are you doing?" Yang Kai stared coldly at Sangde, his voice icy.

"Young Brother, don't be nervous." Sangde showed no sign of guilt for his sneak attack, smiling as he looked at Yang Kai. "I was just giving you a little test, nothing malicious."

"A joke? What kind of test requires a sneak attack, and a Divine Soul attack at that!" Yang Kai was furious. If it had been anyone else with weaker Divine Soul power, they'd be lying on the ground crying for their parents.

If the Divine Soul is injured, it's no small matter. Yang Kai instantly lost all goodwill toward Sangde.

"Because what I need to do requires Divine Soul power. If I hadn't seen you easily handle an opponent of the same level outside, I wouldn't have bothered to test you."

Yang Kai snorted, "So I should feel honored?"

And from his words, it sounded like he knew about Yang Kai's fight with Yu Leping outside.

"Young Brother, calm down and listen to me." Sangde reached out to soothe him.

Yang Kai glared at him for a while, but there was nothing he could do. He needed Sangde's help, so even if he was unhappy, he had to wait until the Purification Array was repaired.

Seeing Yang Kai sit down, Sangde changed to a friendly face and asked, "Young Brother, how long have you been trapped in this place?"

Yang Kai's heart skipped. Did this old fox see through him? Did he know Yang Kai was new here? But he had just said he didn't lack Source Crystals, so there was no reason to attack. Yang Kai kept his composure and replied, "Why do you ask?"

Sangde smiled, "If you don't want to say, that's fine. I've been trapped here for nine hundred years."

Yang Kai sneered inwardly, thinking it would be best if he died here.

Sangde sighed, "Nine hundred years ago, I was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Nine hundred years later, I'm still at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm! My artifact refining skills have improved, but so what? I still can't leave. Without leaving, I can't break through to the Emperor Realm. Sooner or later, I'll die here."

Yang Kai frowned slightly. He didn't know why Sangde was saying all this, but he kept quiet and listened.

"No matter how long you've been trapped, I have just one question..." Sangde's face suddenly turned serious, his eyes sharp. "Do you want to leave this place?"

Yang Kai's heart trembled. He stared at Sangde, "Do you have a way to leave?"

Sangde smiled faintly, answering with another question, "Do I? Hehehe..."

That infuriating answer made Yang Kai want to grab Sangde and use the Soul-Searching Technique to see what was in his head.

He had planned to stay here for a while and slowly look for a way out, but now Sangde had revealed a clue, making it impossible for Yang Kai not to be tempted.

After thinking for a moment, Yang Kai said, "Master, let's be frank. You say you have a way to leave, but I don't believe it. Several Emperor Realm experts are trapped here—if there was a way out, wouldn't they have left?"

"They are they, and I am me—don't lump us together!" Sangde curled his lip with pride. "Besides, the method I possess for leaving this place is useless to even Emperor Realm cultivators. Even if they knew it, they still couldn't escape."

Yang Kai frowned. "If even Emperor Realm experts can't leave, how can you?"

"That's my business!" Sangde snorted impatiently. "Me coming to you is your opportunity. Whether you seize it depends on your own ability."

Sangde seemed a bit moody. Yang Kai was sure that if he refused, Sangde would try to kill him to keep the secret. The old man was an artificer, but nine hundred years ago he was already at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and his artificer rank had improved on Tongtian Island. His strength was definitely not weak.

Now that Sangde had revealed the secret, Yang Kai had only two choices: cooperate or become enemies!

"If this is truly an opportunity, I won't miss it. But how do I know you're telling the truth? At least tell me where the exit is."

Sangde smiled, "You're cautious, I like working with cautious people." He paused, "The exit is in Jixu Sea."

Yang Kai curled his lip. That answer was as good as saying nothing.

He knew well how vast Jixu Sea was. Sangde only said the exit was there, but who could find it, and how could it be verified?

Sangde said, "To be honest, I'm not the only one who knows the location of the exit. Two others know as well!"

"Who?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

"The master of Tongtian City and the master of Ice Heart Pavilion!" Sangde snorted. "Those two are the strongest on all of Tongtian Island."

Yang Kai was surprised. He had thought only Sangde knew such a secret, but it turned out the masters of Tongtian City and Ice Heart Pavilion also knew.

He had heard from Jiao Yi that the master of Tongtian City was at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, but living and cultivating on Tongtian Island, his strength couldn't reach its peak. As for the master of Ice Heart Pavilion, Yang Kai wasn't sure, but guessed her situation was similar.

In other words, both were Third Stage Emperor Realm cultivators, but couldn't use their full strength.

"If they know, why don't they leave? With their strength, shouldn't they be able to go anywhere?" Yang Kai was puzzled.

"Go anywhere?" Sangde sneered. "Not likely. Outside, such power could dominate the world, but in Jixu Sea, if those two stay outside too long, they're courting death!"

"Because their strength can't be replenished?" Yang Kai suddenly understood.

"Exactly!" Sangde nodded. "Jixu Sea is vast. Even if those two exhaust their power, they can't fly to the exit. Once their strength runs out, in Jixu Secret Realm they can't replenish it. No matter how strong they are, it's a dead end."

Jixu Secret Realm is filled with endless transforming force, making it impossible for any cultivator to absorb Spiritual Qi. If the sea is calm, it's fine—they can stop, set up a Purification Array, use Source Crystals and Pills to recover, and move on when ready.

But Yang Kai knew from traveling through Jixu Sea that in the depths, there were countless waterspouts with terrifying suction, not places for peaceful recovery.

The deeper you go, the more waterspouts there are, and the stronger their pull. Emperor Realm experts may seem powerful, but if they fly there and run out of strength, they won't be able to resist.

By now, Yang Kai was mostly convinced. Sangde's words made sense, and he couldn't help but believe.

"Where exactly is the exit? Can you show me?" Yang Kai tried to sound casual, hiding his excitement.

What even those at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm couldn’t accomplish, Yang Kai might just be able to. With the Xuan Realm Pearl in his possession, he could retreat inside whenever his strength was exhausted, recover safely, and then continue forward. The only thing he truly needed to worry about was whether those waterspouts would be too fierce.

If they were too strong, he wouldn't be able to get out either.

But getting the location of the exit was definitely the right move.

"I can't show you that!" Sangde refused flatly.

Yang Kai said seriously, "That's not fair, Master. You want to cooperate, but won't share information. How can I trust you on just your word?"

Sangde merely smiled and said, "Believe it if you wish; if not, then it matters little."

He looked like he had Yang Kai cornered, making Yang Kai grind his teeth in frustration but unable to do anything.

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai asked, "I don't understand, what does leaving have to do with you wanting to cooperate with me?"

Sangde replied, "To leave, you need not only the location of the exit, but also a tool. Do you plan to just fly out?"

Yang Kai frowned, "You don't even have the tool to leave?"

Sangde replied, "There is such a tool, but it's not with me—we'll have to go and retrieve it. And getting it isn't something I can do alone; it requires several people working together. That's precisely why I sought you out."

Yang Kai pondered, "Getting that item, does it have to do with the strength of one's Divine Soul?"

Sangde smiled and nodded, "Exactly. You managed to withstand seventy percent of my Divine Soul power in a rush, that's impressive. It means your Divine Soul cultivation is not far behind mine. Otherwise, do you think I'd be telling you all this?"

He looked proud, as if Yang Kai surviving seventy percent of his Divine Soul power was an honor. He didn't know Yang Kai had only used twenty percent of his own power—if not for worrying about hurting the old fox, Yang Kai would have shown him what real Divine Soul power was, so he wouldn't be so arrogant.

Yang Kai asked, "If that item is the tool to leave, why isn't it here?"

Sangde snorted, "My master made it. With my skills, I can't make it yet!"

Yang Kai’s body trembled in shock! Sangde had supposedly already glimpsed the mysteries of becoming an Imperial-Grade Artifact Refiner, yet even he couldn’t forge such a thing. Didn’t that mean his master was a true Imperial-Grade Artifact Refiner?

There was actually an Imperial-Grade Artifact Refiner in the Jixu Secret Realm, and apparently no one knew. Yang Kai was extremely shocked.

Sangde seemed to notice Yang Kai's doubts and explained, "My master doesn't live in Tongtian City and has never shown his artifact refining skills in front of outsiders, so no one knows."

"If it's your master's item, won't he mind if you take it?" Yang Kai sneered. Sangde really wasn't a good person, coveting his master's things. What kind of blind master would accept such a rebellious disciple? If it were him, he'd have cleaned house long ago and never let Sangde live this long.
