## Chapter 1319 — Deal

The elder surnamed Wang wore a bitter expression. Upon hearing this, he replied honestly, “You must forgive the embarrassment, Steward Lian. This boy is one of my descendants—he apprenticed under the Jidao Sect. Passing through Black Crow City on this trip, he came here to pay his respects to me.”

“Pay his respects?” The middle-aged woman gave a faint nod. “It’s rare to see such filial piety… but surely it’s not just a visit, is it? Why is Steward Wang’s command token in this boy’s hand?”

As she spoke she suddenly opened her hand; an invisible suction force surged out and drew in the token Wang Yuhan had been holding — it was the exact token Steward Wang had earlier handed to Wang Yuhan.

The elderly man surnamed Wang’s face flickered through a storm of emotions, anger and humiliation.

He had no idea Wang Yuhan was so brazen as to use his command token to commune with that young woman Xiao Qing by Divine Sense, delivering orders in his stead and obstructing Hehuan House’s transaction. Had he known, he would never have handed the token over so lightly.

His original intent had simply been to avoid personally meddling in the younger generation’s affairs — to open a little convenience for his grandson, that was all.

Now that such a thing had happened and the middle-aged beauty had been roused, matters would likely be difficult to settle.

Faced with the woman’s interrogation, Steward Wang didn’t know how to answer and could only remain silent. Steward Lian, being quick-witted, needed only a moment’s thought to piece together most of the matter; her expression chilled as she quietly transmitted by Divine Sense to Steward Wang: “I don’t care what grievances this descendant of yours has with that youngster, but an ordinary outsider dares to rashly interfere in Hehuan House’s affairs, even obstructing transactions — you should understand the consequences!”

Steward Wang felt a jolt in his chest and his face grew even more bitter.

The middle-aged beauty snorted lightly, continuing to transmit: “However, since things have already come to this, I won’t rebuke you further in front of outsiders. This time I’ll let it pass — the price that youngster offered isn’t small. So long as he truly intends to take Yue’er away, the transaction can still go through! Steward Wang, I’ll fine you a year’s stipend this time; any objections?”

“I dare not, I leave it to Steward Lian!” Steward Wang’s face relaxed slightly, the anxiety lifting a notch.

“Also, your descendant — don’t let him set foot in Hehuan House again. Otherwise don’t blame me for being uncivil to him!” The middle-aged beauty warned. Steward Wang hurriedly nodded in agreement.

The two exchanged Divine Sense words; Yang Kai naturally observed it all, though he didn’t know precisely what was said. Judging from the situation before him, things didn’t look too bad — there was ample room to maneuver. With that thought, his expression instantly relaxed.

After a moment, the middle-aged beauty finished dealing with Steward Wang’s matter, then raised her fine eyes to Yang Kai and smiled: “Young man, though the price you offered was tempting and enough to redeem Yue’er from here, you dared to forcibly take someone away before our house had fully consented, and even struck at Xiao Qing — you take us far too lightly.”

Yang Kai’s expression flickered slightly before he grinned, cupped his fists, and said, “This junior’s actions just now were indeed reckless. I ask the honored seniors to be magnanimous and forgive my offense. Miss Xiao Qing, allow me to offer you an apology as well.”

With his shrewdness, he could tell the obstruction had been carried out entirely by Wang Yuhan acting without authority. The middle-aged beauty and the others were clearly satisfied with the price offered; the only problem was that his earlier conduct had embarrassed the Hehuan House, for the commotion had drawn many curious onlookers from surrounding pavilions, their faces full of interest.

If the middle-aged beauty really let him go without consequence, the three Stewards’ dignity would be ruined — she only needed a pretext. Yang Kai was happy to cooperate.

Seeing his compliance, the smile on the middle-aged beauty’s face brightened further, though she still turned to Xiao Qing and said coldly: “Xiao Qing, what do you want? That youngster struck you just now — if you want to punish him, say the word and I will see he gets no easy time.”

The young woman glanced at Yang Kai and spoke softly: “Although this gentleman did attack me a moment ago, he did not injure me in the least; he only slightly restricted my freedom. I was not harmed. I leave the matter to Steward Lian.”

“Good!” The middle-aged beauty nodded in satisfaction, considering for a moment before telling Yang Kai: “Very well, the original bargain remains valid, but the terms of the transaction must be altered.”

“Altered?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

“Indeed. I won’t make you pay a heavier price, lest people say I bully the weak. Since you are so determined to take Yue’er, and clearly value her, I won’t break the couple apart — why not grant you your wish? As for what you had left here as collateral, consider it the stake of the transaction; you need not come redeeming it — treat it as punishment. After this transaction, Yue’er will have no further ties to Hehuan House, and Hehuan House will not come for you later!” The woman smiled sweetly at Yang Kai; evidently the two Origin-Grade Pills he’d pawned here had greatly tempted her.

Yang Kai’s face registered the perfect touch of distress.

“What — you still disagree?” The woman’s face chilled. “If so, the deal is void — Yue’er stays, and I will have a thorough talk with you about your disrespect toward our house.”

Yang Kai’s cheek twitched; he forced a smile and said: “You jest, honored lady. I’m very satisfied with your proposal. How could I object? Since that is so, let everything proceed as you say — but before that, I have one request!”

Seeing that Yang Kai had truly agreed, a trace of joy flashed deep within the beautiful woman’s eyes, yet she still kept her face stern and said coldly, “Boy, don’t push your luck.”

“This request would be but a trifle for you to grant.” Yang Kai remained calm and confident.

“Speak it then — but if it is too excessive, do not bother.”

Yang Kai chuckled: “I only wish you to remove the binding placed upon Yue’er.”

“If that is all, I can oblige.” The woman nodded slightly; after all, she had placed the binding on Qian Yue herself, so removing it was a simple matter. She beckoned to Qian Yue: “Yue’er, come here.”

Qian Yue glanced instinctively at Yang Kai; seeing him nod, she slowly walked over.

Yang Kai stood calmly in place, quietly waiting.

Strictly speaking, the restriction laid down by a Second Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivator wasn’t necessarily beyond Yang Kai’s ability to dispel—but it would certainly take considerable time and effort. Worse yet, he might even have to make physical contact with Qian Yue during the process, which made him somewhat hesitant. Now that he had managed to get the other party to take action instead, Yang Kai naturally wouldn’t let the chance slip by. Judging from their earlier attitude, the people of Hehuan House probably thought they’d made an incredibly profitable deal this time.

Removing the restriction required little time — at most the span of half a teacup. Qian Yue returned along the same path with a joyful face. Seeing Yang Kai’s questioning look, she hurriedly nodded, indicating the binding within her body had been entirely lifted.

“Good. That settles this matter! Young man, take Yue’er and get out of here — be kind to her. If you ever put her in danger, I will not spare you!” The middle-aged beauty waved her hand and issued the order to expel them.

How sincere the last words were, Yang Kai could not tell; likely she was merely currying favor — saying it cost her nothing.

They immediately left together with Qian Yue and Shen Fanlei.

Wang Yuhan also wanted to leave, but under the middle-aged beauty’s hawkish stare he dared not move; he could only cast pleading looks at his elder, face full of supplication.

Steward Wang was furious; with his own position now shaky, he had no energy to care for Wang Yuhan.

After Yang Kai and the others departed, the woman snorted coldly: “Steward Wang, take your descendant and come with me — I must speak with you properly about this matter.”

In public she could not strip Steward Wang’s face of dignity, but afterward she would surely seek accountability.

Steward Wang’s expression was bitter; he nodded and glared fiercely at Wang Yuhan before following the middle-aged beauty.

In Feiling Hall, Yang Kai and his two companions returned to the place and entered the Flying Flowers, Snow, and Moon Pavilion.

Along the way Shen Fanlei kept glancing at Qian Yue with obvious puzzlement; he couldn’t understand why Yang Kai, who had only gone out for a visit, would bring a woman back, and apparently had paid a heavy price to take her; from the earlier exchanges with Hehuan House it seemed Yang Kai had sacrificed a great deal to redeem this woman.

What was so special about her? Shen Fanlei wondered endlessly.

Yang Kai gave no explanation, and Qian Yue followed his lead in everything, enjoying her regained freedom while privately marveling at Yang Kai’s rise in strength and wealth.

When she first met Yang Kai he had been several stages below her, yet now he had surpassed her; moreover, he had withstood Steward Lian’s strike in Hehuan House without so much as a scratch — he must be among the outstanding in the Saint King Realm.

As for the price he had paid to redeem her, Qian Yue wouldn’t even dare imagine it.

He had left Tongxuan Continent later than she had and only recently entered the Star Domain — how had he grown so quickly in strength and amassed such wealth in so short a time? Qian Yue felt profoundly shaken.

As the three of them entered the pavilion, they saw Shen Shitao and Lü Ying being hosted by Yang Yan in the reception area on the first floor, chatting about something. From Yang Yan’s restless expression it was clear she wasn’t adept at entertaining guests. Upon seeing Yang Kai return, her eyes brightened and she hurried to her feet: “You’re back? Miss Shen and Miss Lü have been waiting for you here for over an hour.”

“Do the two ladies need anything?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Nothing much — Fanlei wasn’t in his room so I came to look for him; it seems he was indeed with you. Oh, who is this lady?” Shen Shitao suddenly looked at Qian Yue with a puzzled expression.
