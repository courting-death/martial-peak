## Chapter 192 — Stone Door

Before Meng Xingyuan and Yu Aoqing could walk far, a sudden cacophony of fierce battle erupted outside. Moments later, the two Yunxia disciples who had chased after Yang Kai returned in a disheveled state.

“What happened?” Meng Xingyuan demanded.

“Master Uncle, there are so many bugs!” one of them replied, his face pale.

Before he could say more, a buzzing sound filled Meng Xingyuan's ears, and the next moment, he saw a large mass of black, mist-like creatures rushing towards them.

This mass of black was composed of strange insects the size of a fist, flapping their wings. As he looked, he realized that these insects completely occupied the passage, their numbers countless.

Yu Aoqing cried out in alarm, “Master Uncle, we were captured by these insects!”

Meng Xingyuan's expression turned cold as he shouted, “Fall back behind me!”

He stepped forward, positioning himself in front of the Yunxia disciples, and unleashed a torrent of fierce True Essence.

The strange insects struck by Meng Xingyuan's attacks fell like dumplings, plummeting to the ground, creating a sudden vacuum in front of them.

“Master Uncle is amazing!” one of the Yunxia disciples exclaimed, dazzled by the display.

“Follow me and fight our way out!” Meng Xingyuan commanded, his voice steady as a deep well. He charged ahead, with the two Yunxia disciples protecting Yu Aoqing in the center, closely following Meng Xingyuan.

Step by step, they pushed forward. Each time Meng Xingyuan struck, dozens of strange insects were dispatched, but alas, there were simply too many of them. After unleashing over a dozen attacks, he began to feel winded. He paused for a moment, took a deep breath to suppress the roiling blood in his chest, and unleashed another fierce series of strikes.

As they moved forward, the ground was littered with the corpses of strange insects, forming a thick layer.

After about fifty zhang, Meng Xingyuan suddenly halted, his expression changing drastically.

From deep within the cave came a series of cracking sounds. The walls above them began to crumble, and then a thunderous noise filled the air. The entire cave shook violently.

“Not good!” Meng Xingyuan shouted, “This place is going to collapse! Run!”

The three Yunxia disciples behind him turned pale and hurriedly followed his lead.

However, countless strange insects blocked their path ahead. No matter how fast they tried to move, Meng Xingyuan exerted all his strength but still could not force the insects to retreat. In the chaos, a few stragglers attacked the three disciples behind him, causing them to panic.

After running about thirty zhang, the passage ahead suddenly collapsed, completely blocking their way.

Meng Xingyuan and the three Yunxia disciples turned ashen, and Yu Aoqing looked particularly dazed, clearly not expecting that just as they saw a glimmer of hope, they would fall into absolute despair.

The rumbling continued unabated. At this moment, Yang Kai had already sprinted to the cave entrance. The instant he burst out of the insect nest, the ground beneath him suddenly sank sharply.

Not daring to linger, Yang Kai continued to sprint forward.

When he was attacked by the two Yunxia disciples, he had already ordered the strange insects to destroy the insect tunnel. He knew that facing off against a True Essence Realm expert head-on would yield no good results. Now that he had the strange insects at his disposal, he naturally intended to make use of them.

These insects excelled at burrowing, and destroying their own nest was a trivial task for them.

As the earth shook and cracked, Yang Kai ran several li before finally stopping to look back. He saw that the area around the insect nest's entrance had sunk significantly.

The entire insect nest had completely collapsed.

Yet Yang Kai remained uneasy. He did not know if such a collapse could take the life of a True Essence Realm expert. He focused his thoughts, instructing the strange insects to search underground for the traces of the Yunxia disciples, determined to eradicate them completely!

After quietly waiting for about the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, Yang Kai suddenly heard a reluctant and mournful scream from underground.

That was Meng Xingyuan's voice; the strange insects had found him, and he was currently engaged in battle.

Gradually, the cries became faint and eventually disappeared.

With Meng Xingyuan, a True Essence Realm expert, dead, the Yunxia disciples who were far weaker than him naturally could not survive. They were likely buried deep the moment the insect nest collapsed.

“What a pity for such a flower-like beauty,” the Earth Demon lamented. Yu Aoqing was undoubtedly a rare beauty, but her heart was wicked, with a heart of a snake and scorpion; she deserved to die.

The Earth Demon felt only a tinge of regret.

Yang Kai remained silent, his expression indifferent, standing quietly in place.

Before long, the ground within a few li began to writhe as countless strange insects emerged from underground, surrounding him and awaiting orders.

These strange insects would be Yang Kai's reliance for survival and exploration on Hidden Island.

Since infiltrating Yunxia, Yang Kai had been cautious, walking on thin ice. Only at this moment did he finally shake off the presence of Yunxia, giving him an inexplicable sense of relaxation and freedom.

It was time to make a big move.

These strange insects could fly and were quite fast, so Yang Kai was not worried about being unable to take them with him.

Leading the strange insects outward, he arrived at the edge of the misty barrier. Yang Kai issued the command to break through the mist.

Immediately, several large insects flew over and charged into the mist, gnawing at it.

Before long, a visible gap was chewed into the mist that enveloped the area of over ten li. Yang Kai's expression shifted; this mist could indeed serve as a killing move, but it seemed that only the larger strange insects could emit it, while the fist-sized ones lacked that capability.

In the following days, Yang Kai did not rush to explore Hidden Island but first sought a secluded spot to familiarize himself with his Wings of Yang Flame.

A few days later, Yang Kai hovered in the air above Hidden Island, surveying the entire island.

From mid-air, everything about this mysterious island came into view.

Referring to the diagram he had received from the Jiang family matriarch months ago, Yang Kai quickly discerned his location and sought out the correct route.

After flying a distance forward, Yang Kai landed and employed his footwork to rush ahead.

While using the Wings of Yang Flame was much faster, it consumed an enormous amount of Primordial Qi. On this mysterious solitary island, Yang Kai dared not waste the Yang Liquid in his Dantian.

Moreover, flying in the air made it easy to expose his position, likely attracting the attention of flying demon beasts or experts from Yunxia Sect.

Traveling on foot, though slower, was the safest method.

For several consecutive days, Yang Kai traveled, unceremoniously collecting and consuming any rare treasures he encountered along the way, refining them into energy for his Proud Bone Golden Body.

Hidden Island was indeed fraught with danger, with powerful demon beasts everywhere. If Yang Kai had not been cautious, he would have likely faced numerous battles by now.

In these days of travel, he had not discovered any traces of the Yunxia people, leading him to suspect that they might all be dead.

However, as he approached his final destination, Yang Kai finally saw some signs of human activity.

He became increasingly cautious.

At the very center of Hidden Island stood a solitary peak, towering about a hundred zhang high, with jagged rocks and stunning scenery. According to the diagram provided by the Jiang family matriarch, Yang Kai could confirm that this peak was the location indicated.

But now it seemed that the Yunxia people also had their sights set on this place. He just did not know how many of them there were and what their strengths were.

Arriving at the foot of the solitary peak, Yang Kai hesitated for a long time before gritting his teeth and beginning to climb.

Suppressing his racing heart and holding his breath, Yang Kai had only climbed halfway when he heard a violent commotion from above, shaking the entire solitary peak.

His heart sank, knowing that something must have happened up there, and he quickened his pace.

After a stick of incense, Yang Kai reached the summit and stealthily hid to observe the source of the noise.

About several dozen zhang away, a few Yunxia people were fiercely attacking a stone door.

After observing for a while, Yang Kai couldn't help but feel relieved! Among these people, there was no sign of the Yunxia Sect's elder Huo Xianglan. Leading them was none other than Yu Xiuping, along with several others, most of whom were True Essence Realm experts.

However, at this moment, these individuals appeared quite disheveled, having clearly endured considerable hardships along the way. Many bore injuries, their bodies stained with blood.

Fortunately, they were in such a state; otherwise, Yang Kai would likely not have been able to approach without being detected.

Each of them wielded weapons, unleashing techniques as they repeatedly struck the stone door before them. Each attack caused the stone door to tremble, and a halo of mist radiated from it, rendering their efforts futile.

“Brother Yu…” one person gasped, “What do we do now?”

Yu Xiuping's expression was grim, clearly impatient. “What else can we do? Keep attacking! We must break through this damned stone door! Yunxia has suffered heavy losses this time, with two elders falling. If we return empty-handed, how can we face our sect?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn't help but feel overjoyed.

So, Huo Xianglan is dead too! He just didn't know how that Divine Roaming Realm old woman had met her end. However, this news undoubtedly gave Yang Kai a sense of reassurance, making him fearless.

Yu Xiuping charged forward, desperately urging his True Essence as he relentlessly attacked the stone door, roaring, “With two elders fallen and Yunxia disciples suffering heavy casualties, my daughter is also missing! Everything hinges on this door; if we cannot break it, we will die here. Why bother living in this world any longer!”

Yu Xiuping's madness made the expressions of the others turn grim as well. This expedition to explore Hidden Island had been a grave mistake.

Had they known this trip would be so perilous, they would never have left Yunxia Sect. Given Yunxia Sect's foundation, they clearly were not qualified or capable of exploring Hidden Island.

However, Yu Xiuping's words evidently ignited the fighting spirit in these individuals. They did not bother to rest, silently joining forces to strike the stone door.

This stone door was undoubtedly a barrier left by predecessors. Though it was incredibly sturdy, that did not mean it was unbreakable. Several True Essence Realm experts relentlessly attacked it, and within less than an hour, they had created some cracks in the stone door.

Seeing hope, the Yunxia group became even more ruthless in their attacks.
