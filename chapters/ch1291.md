## Chapter 1291 — Zangxiong Valley

On seeing this, Yang Kai forced a bitter smile; he realized Yang Yan intended to examine that sealing formation, so his plan would be foiled. He could only keep a smile on his face and make small talk with Shen Shitao while waiting for Yang Yan to finish.

During the conversation, Shen Shitao warmly introduced her companions to Yang Kai.

The delicate woman Yang Kai had seen before was Lü Ying, a Qiantian Sect disciple who had followed Shen Shitao into the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Of the other two men, one was of lower cultivation but with bright, piercing eyes named Shen Fanlei—astonishingly, he was Shen Shitao’s younger brother. Hearing the introduction, Yang Kai immediately understood why the two bore subtle similarities in their features: there was blood between them.

The final cultivator, at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, was called Wang Yuhan.

To Yang Kai’s surprise, Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei were not disciples of Qiantian Sect; they came from another sect called Jidao Sect, so they were not of the same sect as Shen Shitao and Lü Ying.

Still, fighters who had ties traveling together was common even if they weren’t of the same force, so Yang Kai didn’t show much astonishment upon learning this.

That Jidao Sect name sounded familiar to him, as if he had heard it somewhere before.

After the introductions Shen Shitao smiled and asked, “Brother Yang, did you come to Zangxiong Valley on some important errand?”

Her voice was sweet and mellow, and combined with a mature, almost liquid charm it was even more alluring than Yin Sudie’s Charm Technique. Yang Kai noticed Wang Yuhan seemed to harbor unusual feelings for Shen Shitao.

But the moment the words Zangxiong Valley were spoken Yang Kai’s face changed and he exclaimed, “This is Zangxiong Valley?”

Shen Shitao was astonished, then covered her mouth and giggled, asking in surprise, “Brother Yang, you didn’t really stumble in here by accident, did you? You truly don’t know what this place is?”

When Yang Kai had first explained himself Shen Shitao had been utterly incredulous—after all this place lay several days’ journey inside from the outer fringe; one would not wander this deep by accident. Yet Yang Kai’s reaction now did not seem feigned, and this planted doubts in her mind about whether he was deceiving her.

“Heh.” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. “I really don’t know what this place is.”

After a moment he asked, “Is this the Zangxiong Valley left behind after the Guyang Sect was exterminated?”

“That’s right.” Shen Shitao nodded slightly, pursing her lips with a smile. “Seems you’re not entirely ignorant of it.”

“Hm, I’ve heard some rumors about this place before.”

Yang Kai had learned of Zangxiong Valley from Daiyuan while in the Flowing Flame Sandland. At the time the Red Candle Fruit was about to ripen; when he and Daiyuan inquired about a Star Emperor Sect disciple it sparked the topic.

According to Daiyuan, Zangxiong Valley had once been the seat of the mighty Guyang Sect, a power rivaling Leitai Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance. But over two thousand years ago someone from Guyang Sect accidentally killed a Star Emperor Sect disciple who had come down from Star Emperor Mountain to gain experience, provoking a catastrophic backlash. A month later Guyang Sect was annihilated, and this place became the peculiar Zangxiong Valley.

Daiyuan also said that since then many warriors liked to come in groups seeking fortune, for rumor held that although Guyang Sect had been destroyed, a hidden secret cave remained containing the sect’s accumulations of countless years—where profit was foremost, people were naturally drawn.

Yet heavy seals and dense yin qi permeated the place; many who came died, and that secret cave remained unfound, so over time the valley fell out of favor.

Whether the story that Guyang Sect was exterminated by the Star Emperor Sect was true could not be verified.

Daiyuan herself had come here once but found nothing; instead a strand of cold qi clung to her, and after returning to Liuli Gate she spent a long time dispelling it.

Yang Kai turned Daiyuan’s words over in his mind, his expression wavering.

If this truly was Zangxiong Valley, he would have to be cautious. Those who had come here before included not only fighters of the Saint King Realm but also experts, and many had fallen. Yang Kai believed that no matter how strong he was, he could not afford the slightest carelessness.

Could those two fragmentary maps in Yang Yan’s hands be pointing to that hidden cave of Guyang Sect? Thinking this made Yang Kai’s heart leap with burning excitement.

If that were so it would solve Dragon Lair Mountain’s current embarrassment—after all, a sect’s treasury would be staggeringly rich.

He kept those thoughts beneath an unreadable expression.

Shen Shitao and the others seemed to notice Yang Kai’s musing and did not interrupt. After a long while Yang Kai drew a deep breath, cupped his fist to Shen Shitao and said, “Thank you, Miss Shen. If not for meeting you, my companion and I might still not know where we are.”

Shen Shitao giggled coquettishly. “You are really careless—didn’t you ask around before coming here? Lucky for you fortune has favored you; otherwise blindly venturing deeper would be a one-way trip even for an expert.”

She wore a scolding air, as if reproaching Yang Kai for not valuing his life.

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh.

Shen Shitao, unaware of some thought, again explained enthusiastically, “Brother Yang, though nothing dangerous has happened yet, if this is indeed the remains of Guyang Sect we are only in the outer ring. The outer seals and formations are not that strong; go deeper and the seals and arrays will be far harsher than the ones that trapped the four of us earlier. You must be extremely careful.”

“Miss Shen,” Wang Yuhan suddenly interjected, “this friend only stumbled in here by accident—why would he press on further? Telling him this seems pointless.”

Shen Shitao’s brows knitted; she said nothing but looked toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Now that I know this is Zangxiong Valley, I won’t go any deeper. You all likely have other matters; I won’t bother you further. Farewell!”

“Brother Yang, take care!” Wang Yuhan said with a smile as he exchanged farewells with Yang Kai, apparently eager for him to leave.

Yang Kai cast a sidelong glance and slightly lifted one corner of his mouth, called Yang Yan, and then leisurely returned the way they had come, his figure growing more distant.

Shen Shitao opened her mouth as if to speak but ultimately held back; when Yang Kai’s figure vanished she sighed softly.

“Hm, Brother Yang is indeed interesting.” Wang Yuhan inclined his head and sneered, “No preparation yet he blundered into Zangxiong Valley—fortunate to have met Miss Shen, otherwise he wouldn’t even know how he died.”

“Senior Brother, you don’t seem to like him.” Shen Fanlei asked with guileless curiosity.

Wang Yuhan chuckled, “Not dislike—just disdainful of those who survive by luck alone. Like I always say, luck eventually runs out; next time he may not be so fortunate.”

He glanced at Shen Shitao as if to persuade her, but Shen Shitao’s expression turned displeased, leaving him helpless.

Shen Shitao was naturally vexed. Encountering someone with such extraordinary fortune as Yang Kai was rare; she had intended to invite him along. Though their reason for entering Zangxiong Valley wasn’t especially perilous, mishaps could occur—having Yang Kai come along might reduce the risk thanks to his luck.

She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to take his leave so quickly, and before she could stop him Wang Yuhan had butt in—how annoying.

“Ah, Senior Sister.” Lü Ying, who had been silent until now, suddenly called out, “You forgot to ask where he’s from.”

Shen Shitao’s nostrils flared in annoyance; her ample, soft chest rose and fell with agitation.

Previously she had meant to investigate Yang Kai’s origins to make future contact easier, but after collecting enough Saint Crystals she discovered Yang Kai had already vanished. When she asked Chang Qi he had been evasive and wouldn’t clearly reveal Yang Kai’s background.

This had long been a regret for Shen Shitao.

Now that she had another chance to meet him, if Wang Yuhan hadn’t meddled she would not have let it go—at minimum she wanted to learn his origins to make future visits easier.

Next time they traveled she could invite him to join the group.

Compared to moving with the others she much preferred traveling with the outrageously lucky Yang Kai.

It was this Wang Yuhan who had interrupted her conversation with Yang Kai time and again, causing her to forget about the matter altogether. Realizing this, Shen Shitao shot Wang Yuhan a glare without the slightest courtesy, only to meet his somewhat ingratiating gaze. He froze, still not understanding what was wrong, while Shen Shitao, her interest already waning, waved her hand and said, “Let’s go. We’ll talk after we find that Thunder Pool and help Fan Lei break through his current bottleneck.”

Saying so, she led the way; Lü Ying, understanding why her Senior Sister had changed mood, likewise glared at Wang Yuhan and followed.

Shen Fanlei, seemingly naturally dull, noticed nothing and hurried after them. Wang Yuhan stayed last, his face dark as he glared in the direction Yang Kai had departed.

Though the Jidao Sect from which he and Shen Fanlei hailed was not a small one, it still could not be compared with the Qiantian Sect. He had long harbored feelings for his Junior Brother’s elder sister, Shen Shitao. Her appearance and figure were both exceptionally striking, especially those naturally alluring peach-blossom eyes that seemed capable of stealing one’s very soul. Every time Shen Fanlei returned to their clan, Wang Yuhan would find some excuse to accompany him, all for the chance to see Shen Shitao once more. He had constantly tried to display his abilities before her, hoping to win the beauty’s heart.
