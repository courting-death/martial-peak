## Chapter 229 — Shura Sect

As he thought of this, Yang Kai's expression darkened, secretly regretting his earlier actions. He could not help but wonder if that scene had caught the eyes of others. If it had been seen, it would surely lead to some trouble.

Who would have thought that a mere Healing Pill would turn into such a rare item?

“Brother Chen, could you come over for a moment?” Suddenly, Wu Chengyi's voice called out from the side. Chen Xueshu responded and smiled at Yang Kai, saying, “Brother Yang, please wait a moment. I will be right back.”

“En.” Yang Kai nodded in acknowledgment.

After Chen Xueshu left, Yang Kai turned his head to look around, only to find that many people were curiously observing him.

This group had not seen a new face in a long time. The Great Han Martial Artists scattered outside had likely all perished, and now, seeing Yang Kai as a newcomer, they were naturally intrigued, especially since he was alone. They could not understand how one person could escape the pursuit of the Martial Artists from the Tianlang Kingdom.

Yang Kai scanned the crowd and noticed the four young women from Wan Hua Palace giving him slight nods.

These four girls had entered the Ghostly Underworld Mountain with Yang Kai. Although they had never spoken much, they had shared the same boat, and now that they found themselves in this predicament, they felt a sense of familiarity.

Yang Kai smiled back at them.

Just as he was observing, two figures suddenly stood up from the crowd. The leading figure was a stunningly beautiful woman, tall and voluptuous, dressed in a tight-fitting green dress that accentuated her curves. Her ample bosom and shapely hips were striking, and her long legs were exposed, with arms like delicate lotus roots. Her skin was as smooth as white jade, glistening with an alluring sheen. Her long fingers were painted with a bright red polish, giving her an enchanting beauty that was hard to ignore.

What was most eye-catching was the pair of quivering breasts on her chest, full and round, rivaling only Lan Chudie among the women Yang Kai had seen.

She approached with a charming smile, swaying her waist like a beautiful snake. Her spring-like eyes fixated on Yang Kai, her smile carrying a profound meaning.

Following closely behind her was a towering man, with a bear-like physique and an exceptionally robust build, larger than anyone else present. His face was chiseled and cold, with a half-foot-long scar running across his cheek, giving him a fierce and intimidating appearance. His eyes gleamed like sharp blades, exuding a chilling and ruthless aura.

Both the woman and the man gave off a bloody and decisive vibe.

Shu Xiaoyu frowned slightly, “Are they coming towards us?”

“Probably,” Yang Kai also furrowed his brows. He noticed that the beautiful woman had been staring at him as she approached.

“Do you know them, Brother Yang?” Shu Xiaoyu asked in confusion.

Yang Kai shook his head in bewilderment. He had never seen these two before. Although Ling Taixu had informed him of most sect names and the strengths of their disciples while they were by the lake, the lake was vast, and there were many people on the opposite side. Ling Taixu could not point them out, so Yang Kai truly did not know where these two came from.

“Could it be because of... the Healing Pill?” Shu Xiaoyu's expression changed.

Yang Kai's face also darkened, and he could not help but grow wary.

“Brother Yang, you must not get into a conflict with them. Their strength is formidable!” Shu Xiaoyu urged anxiously, her face showing concern.

“I will try my best,” Yang Kai nodded slightly. He did not wish to provoke anyone here, as the current situation was precarious. If he made enemies of these two, it would be tantamount to making enemies of everyone present, which would surely lead to a bad outcome. However, if they insisted on bullying him, Yang Kai would not show weakness.

As the beautiful woman and the towering man approached, all eyes were drawn to them, eager to see what this seemingly seductive woman intended to do.

Moments later, the woman stood before Yang Kai, smiling as she looked down at him. Without saying a word, the cold-faced man behind her grew increasingly stern, his eyes piercing like swords, as if trying to see into Yang Kai's heart and soul.

Yang Kai frowned, “Do you two have something to discuss?”

The woman did not answer but instead scrutinized him seriously. Then, slowly bending down, she smiled and brought her face close to Yang Kai's, her delicate nose twitching slightly.

Yang Kai's expression turned strange.

He felt no killing intent or malice from this woman, but her actions were utterly baffling.

The woman sniffed around Yang Kai's body like a curious puppy, her hair brushing against his neck and cheek, sending tingles down his spine.

A faint, fragrant scent lingered at Yang Kai's nose, reminiscent of musk, stirring his imagination.

At the wide neckline of her dress, a breathtaking expanse of white skin and deep cleavage caught Yang Kai's eye, along with the two round and supple curves.

Yang Kai could not help but swallow hard, feeling a heat rising in his throat.

“Hey... what are you doing?” Shu Xiaoyu stared in disbelief, her cheeks flushed, unable to contain her racing heart.

The woman's actions were clearly provocative! The men around who were meditating and resting could hardly contain their excitement, let alone Shu Xiaoyu, an innocent girl who had never experienced such things.

She was sitting right next to Yang Kai, seeing everything more clearly than anyone else.

The sound of swallowing echoed from all directions, many young martial artists filled with envy. They had all harbored fantasies about this voluptuous woman, but due to the towering man behind her, they had always dared not act on those thoughts.

Usually, joking around was harmless, but never had anyone been so close to this woman.

Now, it seemed as if she wanted to pounce on Yang Kai, taking whatever she desired. This scene was simply too tantalizing, especially in such a perilous place after a fierce battle, igniting their blood.

“Miss, you...” Yang Kai felt uncomfortable all over. Although he sensed no killing intent, this woman was too strange. They had never met before, and she was being so intimate right off the bat, which was quite perplexing.

“Shh...” The woman smiled sweetly, extending a delicate finger to Yang Kai's lips, silencing his question.

Continuing to sniff, she unabashedly turned Yang Kai's ears red.

“Brother Yang...” Shu Xiaoyu could no longer bear it and kicked Yang Kai sharply.

“Giggle...” The woman, seeing this, stood up with a light laugh, looking at Yang Kai with great interest. A strange and confused expression appeared on her beautiful face as she stared at him, her eyes filled with bewilderment.

“What do you think?” The woman suddenly turned to ask the towering man.

“Killing intent, blood aura!” The man spoke succinctly, his tone cold.

“En.” The woman nodded slightly, then suddenly covered her mouth and laughed, “Little brother, please do not take offense. It is simply because my Junior Brother and I feel a sense of familiarity from you, which is why we dared to interrupt.”

“Hmph!” Shu Xiaoyu snorted from her nose, turning her head away.

She clearly did not believe such childish words.

Yang Kai did not believe it either.

The woman continued to smile, “This reason is indeed hard to believe, but I am not lying to you. I truly do not understand why myself.”

“Let me introduce myself. I am Ye Qingsi, and this is my Junior Brother, Zhou Ba!”

“Yang Kai!”

“Oh, so it’s Brother Yang...” Ye Qingsi smiled, her demeanor flirtatious, her eyes sparkling. Then she added, “My Junior Brother and I come from the overseas Shura Sect. Brother Yang probably hasn’t heard of it.”

Yang Kai's expression subtly changed, then quickly concealed it. He suddenly understood why this woman had approached him out of the blue.

Overseas Shura Sect! A first-rate power!

Since they were elite disciples of the Shura Sect, they must have cultivated some secret technique of their sect. And the sect's treasured artifact, the Shura Sword, was currently with him; perhaps there was some kind of resonance between them.

No wonder she mentioned a sense of familiarity! Realizing this, Yang Kai did not dare to reveal anything. If she knew that the Shura Sect's treasured artifact was with him, that sense of familiarity would instantly turn into killing intent.

This was beyond doubt.

Feigning ignorance, Yang Kai asked with feigned curiosity, “Overseas?”

Ye Qingsi nodded, “At the southernmost tip of the Great Han, across the endless sea, there are many sects. Brother Yang, being deep in the inland, probably does not know much about it.”

“Is it just you two who came?” Yang Kai asked, showing interest at the right moment, as he still had another sect's treasured artifact within him.

Ye Qingsi smiled, “There are also people from the Twin Islands, but only one is left now, over there!” 

As she spoke, she gestured in a certain direction.

Yang Kai glanced casually and could not help but feel relieved. He thought to himself that fortunately, the people from the Falling Flower Sect had not come; otherwise, they would surely have developed an inexplicable sense of familiarity.

“Where does Brother Yang come from?” Ye Qingsi inquired, clearly still puzzled, wanting to dig deeper.

It was suspicious for two people to feel a sense of familiarity with a stranger for no reason, especially since both she and her Junior Brother felt it.

“Lingxiao Pavilion.” There was nothing to hide about this, and he added, “Perhaps it is because my martial skills carry a hint of killing intent, coupled with the blood I have shed recently, that you two have that feeling.”

“I see.” Ye Qingsi lightly bit her lip, nodding slightly, then giggled, “Fate brings us together. If Brother Yang travels with us, do not worry too much. Just stay close to me, and I will protect you, giggle…”

“Thank you for your kindness.” Yang Kai pondered for a moment, just as he was about to say he would be leaving soon, Wu Chengyi and Chen Xueshu had already walked over.

“Enough chit-chat!” Wu Chengyi's expression was stern as he stood before Yang Kai, looking down at him. “I heard Brother Chen say you are a disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion?”

Yang Kai's brow furrowed slightly, feeling a hint of displeasure. Wu Chengyi gave off an imposing aura, his tone carrying an undeniable dominance and arrogance.

“Indeed.” Yang Kai nodded.
