## Chapter 366 — The Old Man's Intent

Half a day later, Yang Kai emerged with a radiant demeanor.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian hurriedly stepped forward to pay their respects. Upon closer inspection, they found that he had indeed broken through, reaching the level of the True Essence Realm Seventh Stage.

The two Blood Servants nodded discreetly, feeling some admiration; to swiftly break through after a great battle, this young master's aptitude must not be lacking.

Yet, what puzzled them was that after over a decade with the Yang Family, why had he remained an ordinary person? What event had transpired in recent years that allowed him to achieve such success in one leap?

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian gazed at Yang Kai, their expressions varied, silent as if waiting for something.

“What happened to the Yang Family? Why have we been summoned back so early?” Yang Kai asked with a furrowed brow.

Tu Feng's expression darkened as he spoke, “The family head has been injured. During the decisive battle against the experts of the Cangyun Evil Land, the family head took the lead but was injured by a joint attack from the Yinming Ghost King and the Destruction Poison King. Both ghostly poison and toxic energy entered his body. Although he was rescued in time and his life was saved, the elders in the family say the situation is not optimistic, so we must quickly determine the next head of the family.”

“The family head is injured?” Yang Kai was momentarily taken aback.

The current family head of the Yang Family, in terms of identity, should be Yang Kai's uncle Yang Yinghao, a figure of considerable power. To think such a person would be injured during a grand decisive battle, and the injury seems quite severe; otherwise, there would be no urgency to recall the direct bloodline of the Yang Family to engage in the struggle for succession.

“I understand!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Regarding matters and people within the family, Yang Kai knew little, not even having met many of his uncles. Apart from his parents, he had little emotional connection to other members of the Yang Family.

This sentiment was mutual among the other direct bloodlines of the Yang Family as well.

The previous generation of direct bloodlines had also returned to the family after ten years of training outside, showing no mercy towards their brothers during the struggle for succession. Thus, the familial bond within the Yang Family was quite weak and not as deep as in other families.

Seeing his calm response, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were not particularly surprised; having spent a significant amount of time in the Yang Family, they naturally understood their temperament.

“Young Master,” Tu Feng inquired tentatively, “If there are no other matters, shall we return to the Yang Family for now?”

Yang Kai frowned slightly and asked, “Is there a deadline for returning to the family?”

“Not exactly,” Tu Feng slowly shook his head. “Moreover, I estimate you are the first young master to be found. Two days ago, the Golden Feather Eagle was released. Rain Fairy and I chased it all the way here and fortunately encountered you. The others are probably still following the Golden Feather Eagle in search of you.”

“That's good.” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

“Does the young master have any other matters to attend to?”

“En. I want to return to my sect!” Yang Kai nodded.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian exchanged glances, surprised.

In the Yang Family, the direct disciples are raised in isolation, hidden in other sects. Generally, when the ten-year period is up, these young masters would sneak away from their sects to avoid letting the elders and siblings in the sect know.

After all, having lived there for so many years, even a wooden puppet might develop some feelings; deceiving the sect like this would naturally cause some guilt.

Yet here stands this young master, not only leaving openly but specifically wanting to return; this was truly intriguing.

However, they wondered how he would explain this upon seeing the elders of the sect.

Tang Yuxian's curiosity was piqued, “What is the name of your sect?”

Yang Kai chuckled, glancing at her. She wore a smile, eagerly looking at him, seemingly wanting to inquire further.

“It’s best not to say!”

Tang Yuxian was taken aback, not quite understanding his meaning.

However, as a Blood Servant, she felt it inappropriate to press further, sensing that this young master might be a bit difficult to handle.

“Let's go!” While she was lost in thought, Yang Kai had already mounted the Treading Cloud Steed, calling for Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian to follow.

The two exchanged glances and leaped onto the Treading Cloud Steed.

Though both were in the Divine Roaming Realm and could fly quite quickly, with the Treading Cloud Steed available, they gladly conserved their energy and True Essence.

With three Treading Cloud Steeds racing like the wind, the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle followed above them, occasionally emitting sharp cries.

The distance from here to the Lingxiao Pavilion was at least ten thousand miles; even riding the Treading Cloud Steed would take two to three days to arrive.

Yet Yang Kai didn't unleash full speed but maintained a moderate pace.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were aware of the unspoken rules in the Yang Family, and Yang Kai certainly understood as well.

His performance along the way would influence these two Blood Servants' choices in the future.

Participating in the struggle for succession was not merely a contest of the martial prowess of several young masters from the Yang Family. In fact, one's own martial strength was the least important aspect.

What mattered in the struggle for succession was how much support this young master could gather and how many forces could be made to bow.

The more support gathered and the more forces that submitted, the more it demonstrated this young master's connections and capabilities, thus enabling him to ascend to the position of head of the Yang Family!

As the leading family of the Eight Great Families, the Yang Family required connections and resources!

Yang Kai, currently at ground zero, naturally paid great attention to these two Blood Servants welcoming him back home.

If he could manage to win them over along the way, it would mean having two capable Divine Roaming Realm helpers as soon as he returned home.

Thus, the pace could not be too fast. If it were too quick, despite Yang Kai's myriad methods, he would not have time to utilize them; moreover, it couldn't be too slow, for that would appear lazily indifferent.

Leading the way, Yang Kai maintained his speed, and Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian followed him without complaints.

In one day, they would cover two thousand miles at a leisurely pace.

Three days later, they had only covered half the distance.

At night, the three stopped to rest. Tu Feng went out to hunt, while Tang Yuxian searched for dry wood nearby to start a fire.

Once the bonfire was lit, Tu Feng returned with a bountiful catch. The two worked together to wash it in the nearby stream before returning to roast it over the fire.

While they were busy, Yang Kai was several dozen zhang away, whistling and teasing the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle resting atop a tree.

During their journey over the past few days, every time they stopped, Yang Kai would engage in such antics with the Golden Feather Eagle.

However, after three days, the results were minimal; the Golden Feather Eagle seemed to harbor quite the grudge. On that day, Yang Kai had plucked two of its golden feathers to frame Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu; to this day, the eagle viewed Yang Kai as a lifelong enemy! Whenever Yang Kai approached a little, it would screech incessantly, flapping its wings to reveal its fierce demeanor.

Even the fact that Yang Kai belonged to the direct bloodline of the Yang Family had no effect.

Tang Yuxian, while turning the skewered meat in her hands, glanced over at Yang Kai and, seeing him making no progress, couldn't help but chuckle.

“Deserved it!” Tang Yuxian said softly. “Even though the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle is just a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, its intelligence is quite high. Having pulled out two of its feathers, it won't ever think of getting close to you again in this lifetime.”

Tu Feng nodded in agreement, clearly concurring with Tang Yuxian's view.

“The young master should know this, right? Why still engage in such thankless tasks?” Tang Yuxian frowned.

Tu Feng chuckled, “The old man’s intent isn’t in the wine, after all!”

“What does that mean?” Tang Yuxian was taken aback.

Tu Feng smacked his lips, “The young master is trying to devise a way to make us see him in a different light. Can't you see that our pace has not been very fast these past few days? He is deliberately dragging it out.”

Tang Yuxian was astonished. After a moment of thought, she felt that Tu Feng made sense and scrutinized him, saying, “How is it that you're so meticulous? You’ve grown such a big head for nothing.”

Tu Feng chuckled lightly, “It’s not being meticulous; it’s just that the young master’s intentions are too obvious; even a fool could understand... ahem... I may have misspoken.”

“What do you think?” Tang Yuxian smiled at him, making Tu Feng feel quite awkward.

They didn't dwell on it. Tang Yuxian turned to look at Yang Kai, smiling slightly, “If he's thinking this way, then he's bound to be disappointed.”

“En. Regardless of him, we just need to ensure his safety,” Tu Feng laughed, then called out, “Young Master, it's time to eat!”

Yang Kai replied, calmly walking back.

While eating, Tang Yuxian smiled and asked, “Young Master, how's your progress?”

Hearing her question, Tu Feng hurriedly cast a glance at her, signaling her not to interfere in Yang Kai's business; after all, he had made no progress, so asking such a question would be embarrassing for the young master.

In truth, Tang Yuxian meant well, intending to remind Yang Kai not to waste effort, lest he end up with greater disappointment if his hopes were too high.

Young people are often prone to wanting to show off, which is understandable.

Unexpectedly, hearing her question, Yang Kai simply smiled faintly, casually replying while eating, “Almost there. By tomorrow, I should be able to erase its hostility…” 

Tang Yuxian and Tu Feng were immediately stunned, staring blankly at Yang Kai for a moment, unsure of how to respond.

How could it be “almost there”? It was clearly far from it, wasn't it?

Moreover, on what basis did he believe he could eliminate the Golden Feather Eagle's hostility by tomorrow? That Demonic Beast inherently harbored grudges; after plucking its feathers, it would never care for you again in its lifetime.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai noticed their silence and raised his head to ask.

“Nothing.” Tu Feng quickly shook his head, forcing a laugh, “Then I wish Young Master great success!”

The words were not sincere at all, but Yang Kai appeared to be oblivious, merely nodding lightly, “En.”

Tang Yuxian pursed her lips, feeling somewhat pained.

If this young master was so confident and issued such bold claims, what if the Golden Feather Eagle continued to ignore him tomorrow? How embarrassing would that be?

If the young master were to feel humiliated and angry...

At that moment, Tang Yuxian even entertained the idea of killing the Golden Feather Eagle; if it died tonight, the young master would not feel embarrassed tomorrow.

Exchanging glances with Tu Feng, they both lowered their heads, falling silent and unwilling to say another word.

Yang Kai, adept at reading the atmosphere, continued to eat the roasted meat, and a faint smile slowly appeared on his lips, unnoticed by others.
