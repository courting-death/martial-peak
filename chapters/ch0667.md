## Chapter 667 — Promise

In the underground chamber of the Octagonal Tower, Yang Kai maintained the Demon God Transformation, sensing the power and writhing of the Demon Mark within him; his blood surged and his aura was astonishing.

From afar, the three great leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan watched his movements, each occasionally nodding with approval.

Over these days they had observed Yang Kai's growth with their own eyes and naturally felt a comforting pride that the Demon God's chosen successor was no ordinary person.

The only thing that troubled Li Rong was that, even now, she had no effective means to make Yang Kai feel a sense of belonging to the Ancient Demon Clan.

Boom…

A tremendous sound rang out. Centered on Yang Kai, a violent force suddenly erupted. The three leaders who had been observing changed expressions and acted together, unleashing mystical energies to form a barrier and envelop the chamber.

The raging energy ran rampant within the barrier. Yang Kai looked strained as he controlled the power's surge, and only after some time did it gradually stabilize.

Li Rong and the others stole a glance, worry showing on their faces. They hurried over and landed beside Yang Kai, asking softly, "What's wrong?"

Yang Kai frowned; after a long moment he shook his head and said, "Nothing, just a bit restless."

"Restless?" Li Rong was surprised; she had not expected someone as steady as Yang Kai to display a restless side.

"It's nothing serious. I'll head back for now; I'll stop training for today," Yang Kai said, then left.

The three leaders were momentarily speechless as they watched his retreating figure.

"He isn't the sort to grow up in a greenhouse," Hua Mo suddenly sighed deeply.

Han Fei lightly nodded. Although since Chu Jian's death the three leaders had shown no intention of restricting Yang Kai's freedom and had even arranged everything for him, in this Small Xuan Realm he would still inevitably feel somewhat imprisoned.

The Ancient Demon Clan had grown up here; even if clan members yearned to see the outside world, they would not resent this place.

But he was different—suddenly captured from a vast expanse and brought here, he was bound to feel out of place.

The three leaders were no fools and naturally saw what Yang Kai's restlessness stemmed from.

"It seems we can't keep him long," Li Rong said wryly.

"I'll go talk to him," Han Fei suddenly said through gritted teeth.

"All right. See if there's any other reason; if we can help, don't hesitate to tell us," Li Rong admonished.

Han Fei gave a slight nod.

In the stone chamber, Yang Kai held the medicinal materials in his hands but could not settle his spirit, and he had no interest in refining pills.

A faint fragrance suddenly wafted to his nostrils. Yang Kai looked up and saw Han Fei standing before him in cool, austere attire, her bearing eerie.

"Is there some trouble you want to talk about?" Han Fei asked softly.

"Trouble?" Yang Kai was taken aback and smiled, "What trouble would I have?"

"Then what are you restless about?"

"I can't say," Yang Kai slowly shook his head, clearly unwilling to open up.

"You mean you don't want to say?" Han Fei stared at him with burning eyes.

Yang Kai's expression turned playful: "What, Leader Han Fei has taken up counseling? You're not suited to that. If anyone can counsel me properly, it would be Li Rong."

"How am I not suited?" Han Fei immediately took offense.

"You always give off a 'keep your distance' vibe; how can you make others open up?" Yang Kai laughed.

Han Fei sniffed and said, "Let's keep things separate. Young people having troubles is normal. After all, I've lived more years than you and have richer life experience. I've been through your age; if you're willing, you can tell me—there's nothing I can't counsel you on."

"You understand affairs between men and women?" Yang Kai teased.

Han Fei was suddenly at a loss for words, her body trembling; she had never been infatuated with any man in her life and naturally did not know what love felt like. If Yang Kai were truly troubled by such things, she would be helpless.

"Is it really that you want to leave the Small Xuan Realm?" Han Fei asked coldly.

"When did I ever say that?" Yang Kai felt puzzled.

"Isn't that so? Your restlessness is entirely because this realm binds you!"

"A bit, yes," Yang Kai admitted plainly. "This place makes me uncomfortable."

"Even though we treated you so sincerely?"

"It's not about you. I just have matters left unfinished; I need to find a few people," Yang Kai shook his head, not understanding what she was indignant about.

Han Fei drew a deep breath; her ample chest heaved exaggeratedly, its elasticity startling. "But don't worry, we weren't intending to keep you long. After a while you can leave here."

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai's expression brightened.

Han Fei looked at him coldly. "Senior Coffin-Servant sent you in solely because you possess Divine Sense Fire; we need you to refine Saint-Grade Pills. But your pill-refining speed is too fast, and the Small Xuan Realm's stock of medicinal materials is nearly exhausted. Without materials you cannot continue refining; to advance your alchemy you must go outside and find a way yourself."

Yang Kai's eyes gradually brightened. The shackles that had bound him seemed to shatter, and he suddenly felt a sense of freedom.

"Happy now?" Han Fei sneered. "Li Rong, Hua Mo and I never restricted you. If you had said you wanted to leave, we would have sent you at once; you were the one doubting us and not daring to ask."

Yang Kai felt somewhat embarrassed.

He had indeed been worried. The Ancient Demon Clan had placed all their hopes on him, making him afraid to request departure. Even though they treated him with respect and listened to him, Yang Kai did not know if they might turn hostile if he made such a demand.

Yet Han Fei had seen through his thoughts and suspicions at a glance.

"I only want to tell you this: no matter what you think or do, since you are the Great Demon God's chosen successor, our Ancient Demon Clan will follow ancestral rules and forever serve you, obeying your orders. If you lack this resolve, our clan may be lost by your hand!" Han Fei tossed out cold words and turned to leave.

Yang Kai scratched his head, feeling awkward for a long while.

Recalling Chu Jian's death and how Li Rong and the others had treated him afterward, Yang Kai suddenly felt somewhat ashamed.

They had truly treated him sincerely, but he had kept his distance from them.

After some time the air before him warped, and the three great leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan appeared together. Yang Kai looked up and saw that they seemed to have discussed something; their faces bore resolute expressions.

Li Rong first gave him an apologetic smile. "Han Fei's words just now were a bit over the top, but she was thinking of the clan. Please forgive her."

Han Fei stepped out from behind her, looking embarrassed, and stammered, "Sorry."

"I should be the one to apologize," Yang Kai said calmly. "I overthought things and failed to appreciate your sincerity."

"We were thinking of our clan; that's perhaps a selfish concern," Li Rong smiled wryly. "But from now on we'll consider matters more from your standpoint. So, do you truly want to leave?"

At those words the three leaders all fixed burning gazes on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded.

Han Fei couldn't help feeling a little disappointed, and Hua Mo's expression darkened considerably.

Li Rong's expression did not change; she gave a faint smile. "Your wish to leave is understandable. Very well, we'll send you away. You are not of our clan and are not bound by this Small Xuan Realm; you may come and go freely."

"I didn't say I was leaving right now," Yang Kai shook his head.

The three brightened and awaited what he'd say next.

"Han Fei said your remaining medicinal materials aren't much, right?"

"Yes," Li Rong nodded. "They should have been exhausted already, but we gathered quite a lot from Chu Jian, so they've lasted until now. But at your refining speed they'll be used up in less than a month."

"Then use up all your medicinal materials; the pills I refine will be of use to you. Once the materials are gone, I'll go out."

"Agreed." Li Rong smiled sweetly. "Thanks to your efforts these past year and a half, our clan has received many good pills and their strength has greatly improved. On their behalf, thank you."

"You're being too formal."

"You still think of yourself as an outsider," Han Fei grumbled. Although she had just apologized, upon hearing Yang Kai insist on leaving she couldn't help feeling angry.

"With no materials left, me staying is pointless. I can't wait decades or centuries for your medicinal sources to replenish before I continue refining. That's too much of a waste of time. If I go out I can find materials myself and improve my pillcraft; I should soon be able to refine Saint-Grade Pills."

His expression suddenly turned solemn. Yang Kai said in a low voice, "I promise that once my pillcraft reaches your standards, I will certainly return and bring you all out of here!"

The three great leaders were shaken, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment as joy and excitement flooded their faces.

“Do you truly mean that?” Li Rong asked anxiously.

“I do!” Yang Kai’s expression was solemn. “I have never promised anyone anything before—this is the first time.”

Li Rong gazed at him, sensing his sincerity; tears welled in her beautiful eyes and she whispered, "Thank you."

Han Fei and Hua Mo also quickly voiced their thanks, unable to hide their relief.

"Rest assured, our clan also places great importance on promises and ancestral rules; even if we gain our freedom, we will still follow you!" Li Rong hurriedly added, her expression firm.

"We'll deal with that later," Yang Kai chuckled. "Now hand over all your remaining medicinal materials."

"They're all with me." Li Rong said as she waved her hand over her Void Ring, and a mountain of medicinal materials appeared before Yang Kai.

"This is all the remaining medicinal materials."

"I'll refine them as quickly as I can," Yang Kai nodded lightly, his body and mind relaxing.
