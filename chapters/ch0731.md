## Chapter 731 — Running Wild

On the outskirts of the glacier, several Transcendent Realm experts of the Ice Sect joined forces to oppose Yang Kai, and they were miserable beyond words.

They had all assumed he was just some young brat, that any one of their Senior Brothers could take him down without effort, but what Ni Ren and the others had not expected was that Yang Kai’s strength would be so outstanding and extraordinary that a single blow put them on the ropes and left them wretchedly overmatched.

Such a vast disparity shocked them all.

Although their True Yuan attributes clashed with one another, it was undeniably Yang Kai’s True Yuan that was purer and denser; when True Yuan collided, the Martial Skill techniques they unleashed simply vanished like spring snow under a scorching sun, dissolving before they even reached the other’s body.

“Whoever dares block me today, I will see to their death!”

Charging in, Yang Kai suddenly showed an impatient expression, his words cold and shouted, and his eyes carried an utterly merciless chill.

Ni Ren’s heart trembled; a sudden unease rose within him and he instinctively took a step back, adopting a defensive stance. Under the murderous threat in Yang Kai’s gaze, a dreadful feeling finally dawned on him.

Yang Kai’s display had completely exceeded his expectations; he could not have imagined that this young man could, by himself, completely control and subdue several of his Senior Brothers.

“This is my Ice Sect, you have no right to be so brazen!” Ni Ren barked, his tones fierce but his insides weak, gnashing his teeth as he roared.

“You said the same thing earlier.” Yang Kai glanced at him coldly. “Is the Ice Sect so great? I’ll show you what I call brazen!”

As soon as his words fell, wind and thunder stirred; around Ni Ren and the others appeared a slaughter field formed by the crossing of wind and thunder forces. Relentless Wind Blades and swift, massively destructive crackling lightning wrapped them all. The two forces ravaged within the killing field, and the defensive Secret Treasures in their hands flickered and dimmed, their Spiritual Qi drained; in less than a breath they ceased functioning.

The ice-type True Yuan that shielded their bodies could not resist the corrosion of those wind-and-thunder forces; their clothes were torn and their flesh was lacerated by countless wounds.

Feeling the aura of death sweeping toward them, Ni Ren and the others turned deathly pale.

Trapped in that energy-crossed slaughter field, they could not even flee.

Yang Kai slowly extended a hand and slapped down toward their position. In the sky, a massive palmprint suddenly manifested, blazing gold like a falling sun, pressing down with scorching, annihilating energy as if a mountain were collapsing.

Its momentum was overwhelming; before the palmprint struck, the glacial world had already begun to melt, curtains of mist rising into the air.

Ni Ren and his several Senior Brothers went limp, nearly collapsing to their knees, their eyeballs trembling violently as they stared, stunned, at the enormous palmprint descending from the heavens.

“Stop!” A sharp female voice reached their ears, and a white figure shot out from the heart of the glacier; in the blink of an eye she was over Ni Ren and the others, lifting a delicate jade palm to meet Yang Kai’s attack.

Slap...

The golden palmprint shattered outright, and Yang Kai stumbled back several paces, his face draining of color and blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.

Yet he was not alarmed but delighted, a faint smile curving his lips as he fixed his gaze on the suddenly appeared woman.

She was a voluptuous mature beauty in a pure white gown, her expression icy cold as she regarded Yang Kai with a mixture of caution and disbelief, seeming unable to accept that such a young man had so easily bested Ni Ren and the others.

Ni Ren and his Senior Brothers were all First Stage of the Transcendent Realm; their strength within the Ice Sect was not low. To be ambushed by a single opponent and still meet this outcome was something she found hard to swallow.

Since when had such a formidable young man appeared on the continent?

“Finally someone who's in charge.” Yang Kai snorted lightly.

“Elder Qian Yue!” Ni Ren and the others brightened as if they had seen a savior, promptly calling out with relief.

“Withdraw.” Qian Yue waved her jade hand, and the wind-and-thunder killing field that had wrapped around Ni Ren and the others was immediately dispelled.

Yang Kai’s expression turned grave; this woman was a Saint Realm expert, so such a method was not surprising. The reason he had feigned an intent to kill Ni Ren and the others and made such a tremendous commotion was precisely to draw her out.

This woman was the one who had been spying on him from inside one of the glaciers.

Ni Ren and those like him could not run the Ice Sect, but this woman probably could.

“Which faction do you belong to? How did you master the mysteries of three types of energy?” Qian Yue’s brows furrowed as she studied Yang Kai’s clothing for clues, but to no avail.

“That’s none of your concern. I’ve come here to see someone.” Yang Kai took a light breath. “Open a convenient way for me. If she is well, I will take her away and this matter will end. If she is not, let the Ice Sect prepare to pay the price.”

“Arrogant.” Qian Yue slowly shook her head, a trace of mockery in her beautiful eyes. “The Ice Sect has concealed itself for long; its name is not illustrious, but we are not to be bullied by just anyone. The one you seek is not here. Go back to wherever you came from, or do not blame me for taking action against you.”

“Don’t play coy with me. Su Yan is in your Ice Sect; we both know it.” Yang Kai’s gaze was indifferent, unmoved by Qian Yue’s words.

“I said she is not in the Ice Sect.” Qian Yue’s heart stirred with a flash of anger, and her expression soured.

“Oh?” Yang Kai laughed mockingly. “Want me to point out exactly where she is?”

Saying that, he pointed in a direction. “About ten li from here, inside a glacier. The person I seek is sleeping.”

Qian Yue’s face changed; she stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, utterly taken aback.

The lad’s words were uncannily precise; Qian Yue could not fathom how he knew.

“Did I hit the mark?” Yang Kai took in her change of expression and said coldly, “I only want a single meeting with her, to see what has befallen her now.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Qian Yue composed her face, seeming aloof and unapproachable.

“If you insist on denying me, I’ll have to force my way in.” Yang Kai’s expression suddenly turned ferocious as he growled, “I hope your Ice Sect can bear the consequences!”

“If you dare run wild here, do not blame me if your life is lost!” Qian Yue ground her teeth, her threat unmistakable.

Yang Kai lightly inclined his head and no longer wasted words; his vast True Yuan suddenly erupted.

Whoosh...

The Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurled instantly — magnificent, enormous wings so beautiful everyone stared, unsure whether this was a Martial Skill or the power of a Secret Treasure.

In a blink, Yang Kai vanished from his original spot.

Qian Yue’s face changed; her delicate form swayed and she hurriedly gave chase.

Boom...

A glacier a hundred zhang high suddenly resounded with a tremendous crack; under a force unmatched, it split waist-high, the upper half shattering into blocks of ice that scattered and fell.

Boom, boom, boom...

A series of thunderous booms spread through the glaciers. Ni Ren and the others stared in disbelief; they could not seize Yang Kai’s figure. After those strange wings appeared, the young man’s speed seemed to have reached an extreme.

Even when they cast out their Divine Sense, they could not lock onto him.

As he streaked by, one glacier after another suffered devastating blows; he was like a blazing fireball that charged straight into the ice, using his body and True Yuan to punch one hole after another through the glaciers.

In just a few breaths, five or six glaciers a hundred zhang tall were ruined. Many Ice Sect disciples cultivating within the ice were caught unawares — they cursed as they fled, but no sooner had they escaped the danger than their vision went black and they fell unconscious.

Ni Ren and the others were the same; after watching for a time, they too suddenly collapsed, senseless and unconscious.

Qian Yue did not notice this. The instant Yang Kai shot forward she had pursued, but even with her First Stage Saint Realm cultivation, catching up to Yang Kai when he had deployed Wind-and-Thunder Wings proved unrealistic.

Wind is nimble, thunder is swift; the speed bonus the Wind-and-Thunder Wings granted Yang Kai was beyond description.

High above the glacier world, two figures flashed rapidly, one in pursuit and one fleeing. During the chase, glaciers were torn open and collapsed with thunderous roars.

From the start, Yang Kai had never intended to confront a Saint Realm expert directly.

His present strength was indeed not weak — he could fight above his rank, and against Ni Ren and the others he had won with ease — but he retained some self-awareness: Saint Realm practitioners were beyond his current capacity to oppose.

The energy flowing through every Saint Realm body differed greatly from the Transcendent Realm; the Martial Skill techniques they unleashed had destructive power that Transcendent Realm opponents simply could not match.

The Saint rank is a level above the Transcendent Realm!

To contend with a Saint Realm expert, one would need at least to rise to the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm to have even the slimmest chance.

Against this mature beauty, Yang Kai had no hope of victory, so he could only force her into submission by other means.

He intended to make a cataclysm.

“Boy, stop this instant!” Qian Yue’s feelings surged with rage; unable to catch him, she could only roar with all her might.

“I said if I cannot see Su Yan, I will destroy your Three Thousand Ice Mountain World!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, his speed not decreasing but instead increasing considerably.

His robust body wrapped in scorching True Yuan struck glaciers one after another; no glacier could withstand his ramming force. Where he passed, ruins followed and devastation reigned.

Qian Yue gnashed her teeth, watching the Ice Sect’s century-old foundation being destroyed; her heart ached with pain and rage.

To encounter such a hardheaded, senseless youth, she felt she had truly fallen upon ill fortune.

Mid-chase, Qian Yue suddenly halted, her beautiful eyes turning ice-cold as she fixedly watched Yang Kai’s figure and shouted, “Ji!”

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy grew bizarre; Yang Kai’s expression changed as his forward rush abruptly stalled and he hastily changed direction, but from all sides streams of frigid energy came sweeping in, leaving him nowhere to dodge.

The peerless methods of a Saint Realm expert — he did not even see how it worked before he was struck.

Boom, boom, boom...

The bone-chilling energy battered Yang Kai, tossing him through the air; he rolled uncontrollably, blood scattering with a faint golden sheen, his body uncontrollable as he plunged headlong toward the ground.
