## Chapter 365 — So Insidious?

Yang Kai and the others indeed had unresolved grievances. Earlier, when Xiang Chu wanted to put Yang Kai to death, it would have led to a fight if the Golden Feather Eagle hadn't appeared in time.

Yang Kai clearly did not want to resolve the grudge easily, which was why he plucked the eagle's feather and retaliated on the spot!

Hearing this, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's expressions remained calm, revealing no signs of surprise, as if they had long seen through the tense atmosphere here.

Yet both remained silent, curiously watching Yang Kai, wanting to know what he would do.

The Blood Servants’ task this time was simply to safely bring back the direct line of the Yang Family, with no other instructions. The earlier pressure on the Xiang Family's expert was just due to the injured Golden Feather Eagle.

Now, if Yang Kai wanted to find trouble with those people, that was his own affair; the two Blood Servants would not intervene!

Their loyalty is to the Yang Family, not to Yang Kai. In other words, Yang Kai currently had no authority or strength to command them; they would only act if his life was in danger.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian suddenly felt that this young master they had received this time was quite interesting.

They were both people from the Yang Family and had always held themselves in high regard, being quite arrogant. Yang Kai's aggressive and unyielding attitude was obviously to their liking.

For a moment, both of them became eager with anticipation.

Xiang Chu chuckled awkwardly and said, "Young Master Yang, what do you wish us to do?"

With a fist smaller than others, Xiang Chu had to humble himself.

Elder Xu, who was also enduring excruciating pain, frowned and said, "We accept our defeat this time. However, as the saying goes, 'Enemies should be resolved rather than deepened.' It’s always better to have one more friend than one more enemy. Young Master Yang, since you are also participating in the battle for the heir, please consider carefully."

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold as he scoffed, "Consider carefully? What a joke!"

As his words fell, two blood-red petals suddenly flew out from his body.

Carrying a fragrant aura, they lingered around everyone’s noses.

Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia!

The petals floated delicately in the air, before suddenly transforming into two streaks of red light that flashed away.

Two muffled groans resounded as Xie Rong from Leiguang and Li Fu from Feihong Courtyard fell weakly to the ground, their life force extinguished.

The whole scene was in an uproar!

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, while everyone from the Nan family and the Xiang family changed their expressions in unison.

It seemed that no one expected him to dare to kill in broad daylight.

With the deaths of Xie Rong and Li Fu, the remaining members of Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard collapsed to the ground in terror, looking at Yang Kai with fear, a chill creeping from their heads to their toes.

The petals flashed continuously, as muffled sounds erupted. Not a single disciple from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard remained; in the span of merely ten breaths, they all met their end!

Bodies lay strewn across the ground as Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng found their breaths halting, unintentionally swallowing hard.

"In three months, I want to see your sincerity in Zhongdu, or else... I don't mind extinguishing the prestige of the first-rate families!" Yang Kai’s gaze was frosty, but suddenly he smiled lightly, "You can keep your life for now."

Xiang Chu’s face immediately turned disastrous, a wave of bitterness spreading in his mouth.

Nan Sheng’s eyes were filled with rage as he covered his injured hand, glaring at Yang Kai.

After a long while, Xiang Chu forced out a strained smile, "Thank you! We shall take our leave!"

With a shout, he led his group away.

"I want those three Treading Cloud Steeds!" Yang Kai said, looking at the three demonic beasts the Nan family rode over, his tone indifferent.

Nan Sheng had already mounted, but upon hearing this, he took a deep breath, quickly dismounted, and was pulled away by two Divine Roaming Realm experts, hastily leaving.

Tang Yuxian bit her lip, looking at Yang Kai with amusement, thinking that this young master of hers seemed just like a child who, once gaining the upper hand, began to bully others everywhere.

She opened her mouth, about to speak, but Tu Feng slowly shook his head at her.

"Young Master, Yuxian and I will wait for you over there." Though Tu Feng’s stature was rugged, his thoughts were quite delicate. Knowing Yang Kai had more to discuss with his friends, he left with Tang Yuxian first.

"Okay." Yang Kai nodded.

Once everyone had left, only the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower members remained, Yang Kai found that everyone was looking at him with strange expressions.

Some gazes even held reverence, but Yang Kai felt reassured that the Sisters from the Hu Family and Fang Ziqi were not looking at him that way. Moreover, in Hu Jiao’er’s beautiful eyes, there was a hint of hatred.

"Do you have any questions?" Yang Kai pinched his nose, looking at the Sisters from the Hu Family.

Hu Mei’er bit her lip, wanting to ask something but held back.

Hu Jiao’er, however, straightened her face and coldly said, "No!"

"Uh..." Yang Kai couldn’t help but be taken aback, asking, "Really none?"

"No means none; everything that needs to be known is already known. What else is there to ask?" Hu Jiao’er shot him a fierce glare, pulling her sister’s hand, "Let's go home!"

"Oh..." Hu Mei’er smiled apologetically at Yang Kai and hurried to catch up to her sister.

Guan Chile cupped his fists towards Yang Kai, chuckling as he left with the others.

Fang Ziqi, however, stayed behind, looking mischievously as he asked, "Brother Yang, is the battle for the heir interesting?"

"I don’t know; I haven’t tried." Yang Kai shook his head.

"Are you going to participate?" Fang Ziqi raised his eyebrows, inquiring.

"As long as one has the strength, participation is mandatory; I have no choice!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Interesting, I will visit you in Zhongdu another day!" Fang Ziqi laughed heartily.

"I await your arrival!" Yang Kai replied with a slight smile.

The wind rose, tousling Yang Kai's dark hair. Standing still, he watched as the members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower gradually drifted away, among whom two girls occasionally glanced back until they disappeared from view.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian appeared like spirits beside Yang Kai, silently waiting.

"I need to enter seclusion for a bit. Please wait for me!" Yang Kai instructed lightly before diving into the camp, seeking out a relatively spacious room to settle in.

"Oh!" Tang Yuxian responded in surprise.

After a long while, Tang Yuxian furrowed her brows and said, "Seclusion? Young Master isn’t going to break through, is he?"

"That seems to be the case." Tu Feng nodded slightly, agreeing with Tang Yuxian's observation, "His True Yuan is somewhat erratic; it indeed shows signs of a breakthrough."

"It seems that before we arrived, he must have gone through a fierce battle."

If not for this reason, how could he suddenly show signs of breakthrough without any warning?

Tu Feng smiled faintly, looking up at the Golden Feather Eagle in the sky, "Yuxian, do you think the young master is somewhat overly benevolent?"

Tang Yuxian tilted her head, gazing at Tu Feng, "I just think he is still a child; it's only natural that his methods are softer."

Tu Feng slowly shook his head, speaking in a deep tone, "The people of the Yang Family should not be underestimated, even if they are children. Yuxian, you have been with the Yang Family for so many years; how can you still be so naïve? This young master is not as simple as you think."

"What do you mean?" Tang Yuxian was instantly intrigued.

"You must have noticed his grievances with the Xiang and Nan families, right?"

Tang Yuxian chuckled lightly, "I’m not blind; of course, I can see that. Moreover, their grudges don’t seem shallow."

"What do you think the young master should do?"

"Kill!" Tang Yuxian said lightly, "Otherwise, he should seek to ally. The battle for the heir needs such allies! What he is doing now offends them and lets the tiger return to the mountain. I fear that in the future, the Xiang and Nan families will become his enemies."

"That's why you're too naïve." Tu Feng laughed, "Those two youngsters cannot be killed; they are the next appointed heads of the Nan and Xiang families. If they are killed, the young master would be in deep trouble. He currently lacks the power to handle such a mess, let alone the ability to kill their young masters under the eyes of four Divine Roaming Realm experts."

"Then ally with them." Tang Yuxian pouted.

"If you have already offended them, what’s there to ally about? Even if he does manage to ally with them, those two families will likely harbor ill intentions. It’s better to offend them thoroughly and squeeze every possible benefit out of them." Tu Feng squinted, "Some individuals can only be made to fear you, seeing you and trembling, to have no thoughts of rebellion."

"However, the young master clearly lacks that means and strength."

"Yes, this point is indeed a limitation for the young master; after all, he is still young. But regarding the people of the Nan family, that’s probably how he intends to deal with them. Otherwise, he wouldn’t act so aggressively. I am quite curious to see how he performs in the battle for the heir."

Tang Yuxian looked puzzled, "Why are you so interested in him?"

Tu Feng chuckled, bending down to retrieve the two brilliantly shining feathers on the ground, handing one to Tang Yuxian. He said, "These two feathers weren't knocked off but plucked."

Tang Yuxian looked closely and was astonished, "They were plucked? Who did it?"

"Who else could it be?"

Tang Yuxian widened her eyes in surprise, looking towards the seclusion location of Yang Kai, exclaiming, "So insidious? He actually used us!"

She then froze, looking at Tu Feng, "Since you figured it out long ago, why go along with it?"

"Would you have called him out right there?" Tu Feng rolled his eyes, "After all, he’s also a young master of the Yang Family; how could we let him lose face?"

"What a sly kid! Quite insidious!" Tang Yuxian gritted her teeth inwardly.

Having been used without realizing it, Tang Yuxian felt somewhat displeased. After all, she was also a Divine Roaming Realm expert and couldn’t see through such tricks; that was indeed a bit embarrassing.

Tu Feng frowned, "For this battle for the heir, it’s uncertain whether the Blood Servants will be required to join. If they are, we need to find a reliable young master with strength to follow. You must understand that standing on the wrong side in the battle for the heir could have serious consequences."

"Are you considering following him?" Tang Yuxian raised her brows.

“It’s too soon to say — we’ve only just met him. For now, he’s passable, but let’s see how he performs along the way. Heh… the Yang Family has an unwritten rule: on the journey to escort the young masters home, it’s not only they who are winning us over, we are also observing them to see if they’re worthy of following.”

"Listening to you." Tang Yuxian nodded, and then lightly chuckled, saying, "On this journey, I must keep my eyes peeled to not be used by him again."

"Haha!" Tu Feng laughed heartily.
