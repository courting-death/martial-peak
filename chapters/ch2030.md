## Chapter 2030 — A Spiritual Pill

Yang Kai had once dealt with Zhuo Ningsi when he went to the Spiritual Pill workshop to sign a soul contract with Kang Siran; at that time Zhuo Ningsi had tried to recruit him, but he had refused.

He naturally had some impression of that coquettish woman.

It made sense that she would bid on the Ink Jade Cauldron; after all, as a Shopkeeper of the Danqi Pavilion, acquiring that Ink Jade Cauldron would surely be of great use.

The moment Kang Siran heard Zhuo Ningsi bidding, he grew furious; grievances from two months ago flared up inside him.

On the other side, the thick-browed man of the Jiang Family, upon recognizing Zhuo Ningsi's identity, frowned and said, "Shopkeeper Zhuo, my Jiang Family and your pavilion have often cooperated and we share goodwill — why must you do this?"

Zhuo Ningsi giggled and said, "Elder Jiang, what you say is true, but friendship is one thing and business is another. This Little Sister's heart is set upon this hunt; why not be generous, Elder Jiang, and let this Ink Jade Cauldron go to Little Sister? If so, Little Sister will host a banquet tonight to treat Elder Jiang well — though I wonder if you have the courage to come."

She had, in front of thousands of martial artists, brazenly begun to seduce that Jiang Family cultivator.

As soon as she spoke, numerous cultivators in the hall hissed.

"Bitch!" Kang Siran said, righteously indignant, openly despising Zhuo Ningsi's lewdness.

The Jiang Family man snorted coldly in his private room, unmoved, and said lightly, "It seems, Shopkeeper Zhuo, you truly want to pick a quarrel with my Jiang Family?"

"Oh, how could Little Sister dare? After this matter I will personally go to the Jiang Family to apologize, but I absolutely cannot give up this Ink Jade Cauldron," Zhuo Ningsi wailed, her voice full of grievance that stirred pity, though her final words were resolute as if she had no choice.

"Very well, then — four million three hundred thousand!" the Jiang Family man declared.

Zhuo Ningsi pursed her lips and smiled, unfaltering: "Four million four hundred thousand!"

Before the Jiang Family could raise the price, another voice floated from a neighboring box: "Four million five hundred thousand!"

The Jiang Family man was stunned for a moment, Zhuo Ningsi was also taken aback, and Yang Kai, who sat in private room B-9, turned his head in surprise to look at Kang Siran and asked, "Shopkeeper Kang… are you…?"

It turned out that the one who had spoken and joined the bidding earlier was Kang Siran.

Kang Siran chuckled softly and said, "Just a casual prod — to make that wretched woman feel sick."

Yang Kai nodded in understanding.

"I was wondering who had barged in halfway—so it's Shopkeeper Kang," Zhuo Ningsi purred, her words edged with a barb. "Tell me, are you still as spry as ever, old Shopkeeper?" She taunted him for a moment, laughter in her tone.

Kang Siran chuckled and said, "Thanks for your concern — I'm still hale and hearty."

The Jiang Family man, who had evidently recognized Kang Siran's voice, smiled and said, "Since both of your Commerce Guilds are interested in this cauldron, my Jiang Family will withdraw — we are no match for the two of you."

He had clearly assumed that the bids from Zhuo Ningsi and Kang Siran each represented their backing Commerce Guilds, and decided to retreat to avoid offending both; for the sake of an Ink Jade Cauldron one could offend Zhuo Ningsi, but not two Commerce Guilds at once.

What he did not know was that Kang Siran was merely bidding maliciously; whether Zhuo truly represented the Qiyao Commerce Guild was something only she knew.

"Many thanks for conceding." Seeing the misunderstanding, Kang Siran offered no further explanation; he merely cupped his fists from afar toward that side.

Zhuo Ningsi said, "Shopkeeper Kang, now that it is only the two of us left, what is your bottom line, Shopkeeper Kang?"

“No comment. Make your own bid—if you don’t, this Ink Jade Cauldron will belong to this old man,” Kang Siran snorted coldly.

Zhuo Ningsi was stung and, irritated, stopped engaging with Kang Siran and resumed bidding.

For a time the Ink Jade Cauldron was contested only between the two of them; each increase started at one hundred thousand, and the price climbed all the way to five million.

Only then did Kang Siran laugh and magnanimously say, "Since Shopkeeper Zhuo insists so, I must concede — yes, I withdraw."

"You old bastard!" came Zhuo Ningsi's gnashing curse from her box; though not loud, it was heard clearly by many.

Kang Siran laughed heartily, his face full of satisfaction, as if settling a long-standing score.

On the high platform, the Drunken Old Man took in the scene and let out a faint smile. He stepped forward two paces, just about to announce the ownership of the Ink Jade Cauldron, when a man’s voice suddenly rang out from Room A-1: "Are you finished making a fuss? Since you're done, then... six million!"

At those words the auction hall fell suddenly silent; even the Drunken Old Man, who had taken a few steps forward, paused and stared toward the source of the voice in astonishment.

Zhuo Ningsi, who had thought victory was certain, blinked in surprise and her pretty face twisted.

"Six million? Did I hear wrong?"

"Who is that guy — he raises by a full million at once, is he crazy?"

“Shh, keep your voice down! That man is in Room A-1—he’s definitely a Dao Origin Realm expert. If he hears you, you’ll be dead for sure.”

"So what if he's Dao Origin Realm? Are his Source Crystals any less Source Crystals? A million — if that were mine..."

After a momentary silence the hall erupted into chatter, cultivators whispering among themselves; a sudden one-million raise in Source Crystals was intimidating.

The Drunken Old Man pondered for a moment and then seemed to understand who had bid; a trace of apprehension appeared in his brows and he stepped back slightly, standing quietly.

No one in attendance was in a worse mood than Zhuo Ningsi — she had been about to snatch victory, only for a meddler to appear; anyone would be displeased.

Although she was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, she represented the Qiyao Commerce Guild, so after a short silence she asked coldly, "May I ask your honored family name?"

The bidder in the A-1 room, however, had no intention of answering.

Zhuo Ningsi, annoyed, said, "Hiding behind words — do you not dare to give your name?"

At that the bidder finally sneered, "Ridiculous — I'm merely participating in the auction. What? Must one give their name before bidding? Which auction has such a rule? Deputy City Lord, does Fenglin City's auction have such a rule?"

His last remark was directed at the Drunken Old Man.

The Drunken Old Man frowned for a moment, then cupped his fist and said, "Friend, you jest — Fenglin City's auction certainly has no such rule."

"That's enough, Shopkeeper Zhuo. Considering you're of the Qiyao Commerce Guild, I'll let it slide this time — I won't dignify your provocation. But if you dare speak insolently again, don't blame me for acting without mercy!" As he spoke, a vast surge of Divine Sense poured out from Room A-1, sweeping directly over Zhuo Ningsi's body.

Zhuo Ningsi's face turned pale; she immediately realized the opponent would not tolerate further entanglement, and continued provocation might truly anger him.

Judging from the strength of the Divine Sense he had just displayed, the opponent didn’t seem to be a First Stage Dao Origin expert at all, but rather someone at the Second Stage!

Duan Yuanshan, the lord of Fenglin City, himself was only a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm and already dominated tens of thousands of li; this person had appeared from who-knows-where with strength comparable to Duan Yuanshan.

Even with the Qiyao Commerce Guild's backing, at that cultivation level the man could easily slay Zhuo Ningsi without anyone knowing.

Realizing this, Zhuo Ningsi forced a smile and said, "Since Senior desires this Ink Jade Cauldron, then I shall relinquish it — my congratulations, Senior."

Putting aside that the six million Source Crystal price already exceeded her limit, the man's temperament was also extremely strange; continuing to compete would bring no good result. Zhuo Ningsi sized up the situation and did not continue to bid, offering only a few polite words before withdrawing.

No one had expected that the Ink Jade Cauldron, which had been fiercely contested by many families, would ultimately fall to a mysterious man who had bid only once at six million; though a single bid of six million could certainly buy it.

After counting down three, the Drunken Old Man declared the Ink Jade Cauldron's ownership settled.

"I didn't expect it — six million for one Ink Jade Cauldron. As for the Dao Origin Fruit..." Kang Siran looked crestfallen; though he had brought many Source Crystals, it seemed he had little chance, and his spirits fell.

Yang Kai did not know how to console him and remained silent.

"Next to be auctioned is a Spiritual Pill," the Drunken Old Man on the platform said with a smile, his face mysterious. "As for which Spiritual Pill it is, allow this old man to keep it as a little secret."

As he spoke, a maid brought the auction item forward.

When he lifted the red cloth, everyone saw a dark-cyan Spiritual Pill, roughly the size of a longan, lying quietly on a jade plate.

The pill was not placed in a jade bottle, as if there were no concern its efficacy would dissipate.

Sharp-eyed cultivators, upon seeing the pill, exclaimed, "Pill Patterns! It actually bears Pill Patterns!"

"What? Let me see — hiss... so this is what Pill Patterns look like."

"Not only that, look, this Spiritual Pill seems to have some age — could it be..."

The crowd below whispered and the Drunken Old Man on stage smiled broadly, clearly pleased with the effect.

Although there had been Spiritual Pills at previous auctions, none had ever borne Pill Patterns; this was the first.

Many cultivators had never seen a Spiritual Pill with Pill Patterns, so for a time they were utterly fascinated, staring without blinking.
