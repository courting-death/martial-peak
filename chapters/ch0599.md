## Chapter 599 — Returning the Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure

Glasses clinked, and toasts flowed freely.

Even Shan Qingluo and Biluo drank some. After a few rounds, the Enchantress Queen grew even more radiant, her intense charm making everyone dare not meet her gaze.

After several bouts of drinking, those from the overseas sects finally arrived.

There were Yefang of the Shura Sect, Hua Duanhun of the Falling Flower Sect, Xu Qianhao of the Chilian Sect, representatives from Yunlong Island, Twin Island, and so forth.

A formidable assembly set out for Gu Yun Island, with the elite forces of all the great overseas sects present. Almost all those who had traveled to Zhongdu last time were in attendance.

Gu Feng keenly observed their expressions and was shocked to find that when facing Yang Kai, these renowned overseas figures all behaved with utmost respect.

He felt both fortunate and fearful; his only trace of resentment and discontent vanished like smoke.

These people held positions overseas not inferior to Gu Feng, some even more powerful. Yet, before this Young Master Yang, they all showed such submission. What right did Gu Feng still have to assert control?

After some conversation, Gu Feng learned that the reason they had been able to locate the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique on Gu Yun Island last time was also because of Yang Kai. Now Gu Feng had nothing left to say.

The Sect's Sacred Scripture, lost for three centuries, was found by Yang Kai, effectively granting Gu Yun Island a tremendous favor.

The Tai Yi Seal of the Tai Yi Sect, the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia of the Falling Flower Sect, the Shura Sword of the Shura Sect, the jade pendant of the Chilian Sect’s Sect Leader, the Yunlong Collection from Yunlong Island, the Resurrection Diagram from Twin Island—one treasure after another, originally belonging to the overseas sects, was retrieved by Yang Kai.

Everyone’s breath grew fervent, their eyes blazing as they fixed upon these Ancestral Treasures, faces filled with excitement.

Yang Kai said little, returning each lost treasure to its rightful sect.

“The Shura Sword and the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia I have already refined. The rest remain untouched. If you have any doubts, you may inspect them at will,” Yang Kai smiled warmly at the gathered crowd.

“Rest assured! How could anyone doubt Young Master Yang?” Li Yuanchun laughed heartily. These treasures were indeed valuable but not of the highest grade. They probably did not catch Yang Kai’s eye. Li Yuanchun knew this well.

Others echoed these sentiments, voicing absolute trust in Yang Kai.

Having reclaimed these ancestral treasures lost for over three centuries, all expressed deepest gratitude and repeatedly offered their thanks.

“Young Master Yang, our overseas sects owe you a great debt. If you ever require anything in the future, just come to us overseas. Though I cannot speak for all, the sects present today stand ready to serve,” Li Yuanchun spoke sincerely. His gratitude was not only for the return of the treasures but also for Yang Kai’s great potential.

Although contact between the overseas and the inner lands was limited, forging good relations with Yang Kai could only bring benefit.

“When that day comes, I shall not hesitate,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“That is best.”

“With this matter settled, I shall take my leave,” Yang Kai said, rising.

Li Yuanchun was startled. “Young Master Yang, you are leaving so soon? I had hoped you might stay at Tai Yi Sect a while longer.”

“I appreciate your kindness, Senior. But since that battle, I have not returned to Zhongdu. I wish to go back and see for myself.”

“I see...” Li Yuanchun’s face showed regret. “Then I won’t detain you. I’ll escort you out. If you ever return overseas, be sure to visit Tai Yi Sect.”

“Certainly,” Yang Kai exchanged pleasantries.

A large group followed Yang Kai out of the Spirit-Nourishing Hall. Gu Yun Island’s disciples cast side glances, whispering—wondering what grand affair could have gathered so many dignitaries.

When they saw Yang Kai surrounded like a lord among stars, many of Gu Yun Island’s disciples displayed strange expressions.

Many had seen Yang Kai before and knew he was merely a registered disciple raising peacocks for Elder Han Zhao. Yet they could not fathom how this humble disciple suddenly became the honored guest of such powerful overseas sects.

Moreover, by the looks of those dignitaries, they treated Yang Kai with extraordinary deference, their smiles unceasing.

Not far away, a freckled-faced young girl looked around, confused. Hearing the commotion, she hurried to observe the scene and froze immediately.

She realized that her Junior Brother, whom she had known for six months, was calmly chatting and laughing with these great figures. He showed no fear but complete ease, and the others accompanied him amiably as they walked outside.

Blinking her big eyes, the girl’s mind struggled to comprehend.

When they reached her, she inexplicably stepped out before the crowd, standing in front and gazing blankly at Yang Kai.

Li Yuanchun frowned, puzzled by this young female disciple’s sudden boldness, and glanced at Gu Feng.

Gu Feng barked angrily, “How dare you be insolent! Step aside at once!”

Already flustered and bewildered, Zhong Miaoke was overwhelmed by the island lord’s scolding. Her trembling form looked to Yang Kai with eyes full of fear and whispered, “Junior Brother... what’s happening? Why... why...”

She stammered without composing a coherent sentence.

Shan Qingluo smiled faintly, watching Yang Kai leisurely, silently guessing how he would handle this predicament.

“Insolence!” Gu Feng roared. Not knowing Yang Kai’s true identity was one thing; to mistake the Lord of the Yang Family in Zhongdu for an ordinary disciple, to have him become a registered disciple raising peacocks—this was Gu Yun Island’s greatest mistake. Now that he knew Yang Kai’s identity, Gu Feng had planned to erase all record of Yang Kai’s time on the island once he left to avoid future embarrassment. Yet at this critical moment, Zhong Miaoke had jumped out boldly, even calling him Junior Brother!

How outrageous!

“Seize her! Lock her into the Cangyan Cave!” Gu Feng’s face blazed with fury.

Zhong Miaoke’s legs weakened and nearly collapsed.

The Cangyan Cave was notorious for its constant blistering heat; even Divine Roaming Realm experts found it difficult to endure. For an ordinary disciple like her, a few days there would mean certain death from the high temperatures.

She had never imagined that a single inadvertent act would so enrage the island lord and warrant such a severe punishment.

Her heart was instantly filled with terror and dread.

Two Gu Yun Island disciples hurried forward on command.

Many other disciples who had always looked down on Zhong Miaoke now wore expressions of schadenfreude.

If not for a past opportunity she had seized, Zhong Miaoke would only be a lowly ordinary disciple. But thanks to a letter left by Yang Kai years ago, she had achieved great merit and risen to Elite Disciple status.

This kindled jealousy and resentment among many, who believed her talents did not merit such an honor.

Now that she had caused trouble, they privately rejoiced.

Yang Kai, observing closely, also felt some anger. Over the past six months, Zhong Miaoke had always seemed kind and conflict-averse, quietly cultivating in that remote corner raising peacocks.

Her aptitude and talent were modest, but her diligence unmatched.

Though annoyed, Yang Kai knew this was not his turf and restrained himself, quietly musing before speaking: “Island Lord, please pause. She is truly my Senior Sister; she did not err in addressing me. There is no need to punish her.”

Gu Feng looked slightly embarrassed and cupped his fists. “Young Master Yang jokes. Previously, Gu Yun Island was blind to your greatness. Now that we know your identity, how dare we treat you as just a disciple? Since Young Master Yang intercedes, we shall pardon her this once.”

Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction.

Gu Feng was no fool. Though Yang Kai spoke only a few words, he could see this Young Master indeed cared for Zhong Miaoke.

“Senior Sister, come here.” Yang Kai’s face softened with a kindly smile as he beckoned Zhong Miaoke.

Glistening tears flickered in her beautiful eyes, her youthful face still trembling from fright. Hesitant for a long while, she finally obediently approached, glancing this way and that before shrinking beside Yang Kai, murmuring, “What is happening?”

“Senior Sister, do not fear.” Yang Kai comforted her, then turned to Li Yuanchun. “Senior, I have been living with this Senior Sister for the past half year.”

“Oh?” Li Yuanchun raised an eyebrow, his expression faintly suggestive.

Yang Kai cleared his throat. “Not what you think. Six months ago, after a battle, I somehow fell into the sea, and she rescued me from nearby waters. In truth, she saved my life.”

Li Yuanchun was surprised. He had not guessed this plain-looking girl had saved Yang Kai, and he felt profoundly pleased. His gaze toward Zhong Miaoke grew gentle. “Then she is our overseas sects’ benefactor as well!”

“Indeed!” Yefang nodded firmly. If Zhong Miaoke had not saved Yang Kai, they would never have recovered the treasures lost for three centuries.

“This young girl has truly done a great deed,” Hua Duanhun chuckled softly, swaying elegantly. He stepped forward and asked, “What is your name, young lady?”

“Zhong Miaoke...”

“A fine name.” Hua Duanhun’s eyes gleamed brightly as if surprised by the simple yet pleasant name. “Would you be willing to join my Falling Flower Divine Cult? If you agree, I can establish you as one of our Falling Flower Envoys.”

Zhong Miaoke gasped, staring at Hua Duanhun in disbelief.

The Falling Flower Divine Cult has four sacred Falling Flower Envoys, each holding utmost respect and second only to the cult leader. Since the unfortunate death of one envoy a few years ago, a seat had remained vacant. Countless disciples had vied bitterly for this position but none had claimed it.

Never expected that today, Hua Duanhun would offer Zhong Miaoke such a generous offer just to recruit her.
