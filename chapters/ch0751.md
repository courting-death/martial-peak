## Chapter 751 — Massacre Unleashed

In the whitened void, everyone buzzed about like headless flies; the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land once again came up to Yang Kai to ask him a question.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, glanced her over, and suddenly let out a soft laugh.

“What are you laughing at?” the Saintess frowned. “I find you positively insufferable.”

“Then why are you still talking to me?”

“I don't know anyone here, and what if someone recognizes me as the Saintess…” Ever since arriving she had been skittish and kept to the shadows, not daring to appear before others; after all, the Seven Families Alliance had received her on the isles before and its experts would surely remember her face.

The Saintess is a symbol of nobility and purity; if news of today's events spread, it would damage not only her reputation but the prestige of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

So she feared being recognized. Though she didn't much like Yang Kai, she had no choice but to seek him out.

“It seems we probably won't be getting out of here,” Yang Kai continued to shake his head and sighed lightly.

“No way?” The Saintess' color drained. “Are we going to be trapped here forever?”

“Very likely.” Yang Kai replied with a grave nod.

“Don't scare me — I still haven't found the Sacred Lord yet…” The Saintess panicked. From their interactions Yang Kai had already seen that this naive girl was simple-minded and unfamiliar with human malice, likely owing to her station.

Unlike Yang Kai, who had ventured out at a young age, weathered storms, and learned to remain calm in the face of danger.

“I heard your Sacred Lord is always found by sending the Saintess out — do you have a special method to identify the true Sacred Lord?” Yang Kai's curiosity surged and he asked.

“Why do you ask? I have my way.” The Saintess grew wary. “Only a Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land can do that; even if you ask, I wouldn't tell.”

“Just curious.” Yang Kai shrugged. “If you won't say, fine.”

The Saintess fell silent, apparently worried Yang Kai would pry into the Sacred Land's secrets, and quietly shifted a little away from him.

Time passed as over a hundred martial artists scoured the place, but to no avail.

Gradually anxiety, panic, and unease spread through the white expanse; the warriors searched while muttering curses under their breath.

The experts of the Seven Families Alliance likewise wore sullen expressions.

They, too, now grasped the severity of the situation.

If that glowing orb had forcibly dragged everyone's souls into this inexplicable space with no exit, then they could only wait here to die.

Those present were all at Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm or above; with their souls separated from their bodies, the physical forms remained outside. For a short time nothing would happen, but if too much time passed the bodies would perish.

Should the bodies die, their souls would become rootless wood and source-less water; without a suitable body to inhabit, they would soon vanish.

The fear of death rippled outward, and the atmosphere among the crowd grew tense and delicate.

Yang Kai watched coldly, sensing that something bad might happen soon; he kept to the periphery and remained vigilant.

The Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land acted strangely, seemingly fixated on Yang Kai; wherever he went, she followed at a measured distance.

Yang Kai ignored her and allowed her to trail behind.

After an indeterminate time, everyone gave up searching for an exit — there simply was none.

Each person halted to rest, faces dark with gloom.

Suddenly, the sound of an argument arose from one direction — two martial artists had quarreled and neither would back down, their bickering escalating as if ready to come to blows; the dispute ignited the crowd's simmering agitation like a fuse.

“Old man, if you hadn't insisted on breaking that invisible barrier, we wouldn't be stuck here. Now we're trapped — what do you intend to do?” someone shouted at the elder surnamed Cheng.

As his shout rang out, more warriors joined the chorus of blame; it seemed many felt the calamity was the Cheng elder's fault.

Even several members of the Seven Families Alliance looked at him with displeasure.

The Cheng elder's face darkened as he chuckled coldly. “Gentlemen, that's unfair. True, I gathered everyone here, but before the barrier was broken no one objected. Weren't you all eager to enter the palace behind it and seek treasure? Now that things have come to this, you pin the blame on me — isn't that unreasonable?”

“Regardless, it was you who led us to this point; if we can't find a way out, then you can just die!”

“That's right — the Cheng Family must find a way out, or you'll pay for this!”

“The Seven Families Alliance shares responsibility!”

“Either way it's death; and before we go, we won't let you off easy.”

Everyone appeared righteously indignant and united in outrage, shouting over one another — as if the Seven Families Alliance’s failure to take responsibility justified resorting to desperate action.

Seeing blame turning toward his camp, Hai Wangu's expression darkened. “Before coming here, didn't I say that where profit exists there is also risk, and life and death are for Heaven to decide? You knew this expedition carried danger, yet you chased profit all the same. The Seven Families Alliance has no obligation to protect you; whether you live or die is none of our concern.”

That remark pricked the tinderbox; tempers were already raw, and Hai Wangu's attempt to wash his hands of responsibility pushed the atmosphere to the breaking point.

The Cheng elder sneered and glared at a man who had earlier shouted obscenities at him. “You wish me dead? You haven't the skill for that!”

As he spoke, a sharp Divine Sense burst from his spirit body like a fang-snapping snake, darting forth and plunging into the man's body.

A scream rang out; the man had no chance to retaliate — his spirit body was shattered.

The man's strength was only Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm; against the Cheng elder's First Stage of the Transcendent Realm techniques, survival was impossible.

Silence fell; the mob's uprising instantly stilled, and all eyes trembled toward the spot where the man had vanished.

None had expected the Cheng elder to strike without warning and kill someone so suddenly and utterly.

Yet shortly after, those near the dead man displayed strange, pleased expressions as if nourished; even their spirit bodies appeared slightly denser.

Hai Wangu raised his brow in surprise and peered in that direction.

At the same time, all Transcendent Realm cultivators present noticed something unexpected.

The dead man's spirit body had broken into streams of energy which were swiftly absorbed by several nearby cultivators. Because they absorbed the fallen soul's essence, those few's spirit bodies visibly strengthened.

Yang Kai observed and couldn't help a small, inscrutable smile. “Now this gets interesting,” he murmured.

“What's happening?” the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land asked anxiously; she had been trailing Yang Kai and had seen little. His remark puzzled her.

“A lot of people here are probably going to die,” Yang Kai said with a cold laugh.

As they spoke, the Transcendent Realm figures of the Seven Families shifted expressions and exchanged glances that betrayed their greed.

For most, cultivating soul power is even harder than strengthening the body; without effective soul techniques, one can only take nourishing pills for the soul, and they must be taken for years to show effect.

Yet within this eerie space a strange rule seemed to apply: any spirit body that perished could be absorbed by others.

The temptation this presented was immense for anyone.

But the boon came with risks — a fallen spirit body carries all the memories and life experiences of its former owner. Absorbing too many could warp one's disposition and identity, leading to madness or loss of self.

Yang Kai only absorbed others' soul energy because his World-Ending Demon Eye purified contaminants first, leaving only pure essence; without that he would long have ceased to be himself.

Although the benefit gained this way was slight, it could avert future trouble, and an enemy's lifetime comprehension of the Heavenly Dao and martial way could be preserved intact — precisely what Yang Kai needed most.

The others present clearly hadn't weighed such matters; there is no common technique allowing someone to directly consume another's spirit to grow, and if such methods exist they are rare and precious.

Seeing the few who had benefited from the dead man's soul, the Seven Families' experts inevitably felt tempted.

They exchanged looks and smiled wickedly.

Divine Sense techniques belonging to the Transcendent Realm erupted without warning. Here, with no bodies and no Secret Treasures to use, their only tool was the soul techniques they had cultivated.

Diverse soul techniques swept into the crowd; before many outsiders could react, a dozen or more died as their spirit bodies were smashed.

The Seven Families' experts pounced, ravenous, devouring the souls' remaining energy where the dead had fallen.

Both the Cheng elder and Hai Wangu wore faces flushed with excitement and exhilaration.

In that instant they felt stronger — consuming one person's spirit could equal a year or two of hard cultivation.

They had never valued these outsiders' lives and would rather see them all dead, leaving the relics of the ancient ruins unshared.

Now that such temptation and ideal conditions had appeared, they naturally unleashed a massacre and showed no mercy!
