## Chapter 45 — Follow Me Again and I Won’t Be So Polite

“Because I was beaten.” Faced with his sister’s inquiry, Su Mu dared not withhold the truth. As he answered, he furtively glanced at Su Yan.

Her face was cool and composed. “Why were you beaten?”

“Because my skills were inferior…” Su Mu lowered his head somewhat.

“Why were your skills inferior?” Su Yan pressed further.

Su Mu replied meekly, “I didn’t train properly.”

Su Yan nodded slightly. “At least you have some self-awareness! Do you know what you must do from now on?”

“Yes, I do.”

“Remember what you said today. If you dare to play around again in the future, the one who beats you won’t be anyone else—it will be me personally.”

Su Mu’s expression changed instantly, and he hurriedly promised to train diligently, not to disappoint his sister’s expectations.

After admonishing Su Mu, Su Yan lifted her gaze to the crowd behind him. Her beautiful eyes swept across them, finally resting on Yang Kai. A flicker of surprise crossed her face as she spoke, “You’re the one who beat Cheng Shaofeng?”

Yang Kai thought to himself how well-informed this senior sister was. Even while training here, she knew what was happening outside. He nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“You’re somewhat more promising than Su Mu.” Su Yan did not pay much attention. Yang Kai appeared young, but at fifteen or sixteen years old, only at the eighth stage of the Body Tempering Realm, his talent was likely not exceptional. Naturally, he did not meet her standards. The fact she spoke to him at all was only because he had saved Su Mu.

“Here’s a piece of advice.”

“Please speak, Senior Sister.” Yang Kai’s expression remained calm.

“Stay away from Su Mu. If you keep associating with him, your achievements will never progress beyond this point.”

Yang Kai smiled faintly but said nothing. She could belittle Su Mu, but Yang Kai would not allow himself to be disparaged.

Hearing this, Su Mu’s face immediately darkened, but he dared not utter a word.

“Leave now. I am going to train.” Su Yan closed her eyes again after speaking.

The group quietly withdrew, closing the door behind them. They exchanged glances and all involuntarily exhaled deeply. The pressure inside was immense. Though the beauty was pleasing to the eye, staying too long felt as if both body and soul would be frozen solid.

“I’ll go check on the pills we had refined a few days ago,” Li Yuntian said before taking his leave.

“I’m coming too,” several others quickly followed.

Soon, everyone dispersed to their own affairs, leaving only Su Mu and Yang Kai behind.

Seeing Su Mu seemed occupied, Yang Kai smiled and said, “Junior Brother, you go about your business. I’ll just look around here.”

Su Mu nodded. “Alright. If you see anything you want, just tell me. I’ll help you evaluate it. Most people here are decent, but some are extremely treacherous. Don’t let yourself be taken advantage of.”

After parting ways with Su Mu, Yang Kai began to wander casually through the Black Wind Trade Market.

Here, disciples from the three sects sat wherever they pleased, setting up stalls before them, displaying items for sale or signs indicating what they wished to buy.

The stall owners varied greatly. Some shouted loudly like vegetable vendors in a market, enthusiastically promoting their goods. Others wore haughty expressions, acting as if buyers were beneath them, hoping to lure customers through arrogance. Some were bored and simply cultivated on the spot, unconcerned that their goods might be stolen. Such diversity was endless.

After walking for a while, Yang Kai noticed that these stalls were not only for buying and selling. Some low-level alchemists had signs offering to refine pills for free.

Do not mistake their kindness; they merely needed materials from others to practice. Due to their lack of experience, eight out of ten batches were failures, so these stalls were often quiet.

However, such stalls were few, as alchemists were relatively rare.

Yang Kai kept an eye out for Yang attribute items. In fact, even before entering the Black Wind Trade Market, the Yang Source Seal on his chest had already reacted. The chaotic signals indicated many Yang attribute treasures here.

But as he walked, Yang Kai found most items to be of low grade. The Yang energy contained within these herbs was not as rich as that overflowing from beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine. Naturally, he was not interested.

He had his eye on several items, but after inquiring about prices, he could only shake his head in regret. The asking prices were far beyond what he could afford.

After half an hour of searching, Yang Kai had found nothing of value. However, he had learned the market price for Minor Recovery Pills.

Because these pills were only effective for warriors between the seventh and ninth stages of the Body Tempering Realm, their price was roughly fifty taels each.

The bottle Su Mu had given him contained ten pills, worth about five hundred taels.

Five hundred taels was hardly enough for anything.

On a nearby stall lay a fiery red stone. Yang Kai could clearly feel the intense heat of the Yang energy within, far richer than that overflowing beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine. He estimated that absorbing the Yang energy from this stone could refine at least two or three drops of Yang liquid, equivalent to many days of arduous cultivation.

Though he knew the stall owner looked unfriendly and would likely ask for a high price, Yang Kai still squatted down in front of him, unwilling to give up.

The owner’s face was cold, as if Yang Kai owed him money. He glanced at Yang Kai once, then ignored him.

Yang Kai pretended to be interested in other items, asking their prices. The owner was taciturn, replying briefly. Then, as if by chance, Yang Kai picked up the fiery red stone and asked, “How much for this?”

The owner sneered and spoke more than before: “This is the most expensive item here—three thousand taels.”

Yang Kai was utterly defeated. This was an outrageous price, far beyond his limit. How could he negotiate?

Just as he put down the items and was about to leave, a hand tapped his shoulder. Turning around, he saw a captivating woman smiling at him.

“It really is you,” Hu Mei’er said, somewhat surprised.

“Do you need something?” Yang Kai frowned. To be honest, he had no good impression of this somewhat promiscuous woman. Although she was dressed neatly now, her reckless behavior that day had left a bad impression.

Sensing Yang Kai’s coldness, Hu Mei’er pouted and coquettishly said, “Nothing, just came over to say hello.”

“Hmm, goodbye.” Yang Kai responded coolly and turned to leave.

“Hey…” Hu Mei’er followed closely, walking alongside him. Her delicate body pressed against him from time to time as she gauged his reaction.

After a while, Yang Kai grew annoyed. He realized this woman was not only flirtatious but also shameless. Despite his clear disinterest, she refused to leave.

“Why are you following me?” Yang Kai stopped and frowned.

“I’m not following you. This is the Black Wind Trade Market; I’m just wandering around. What’s wrong? Are you that concerned about me?” Hu Mei’er laughed coquettishly.

“Stop following me, or I won’t be so polite.” Yang Kai’s anger flared.

Hu Mei’er was not afraid; instead, she seemed eager. “What do you mean by ‘not polite’? Like last time?”
