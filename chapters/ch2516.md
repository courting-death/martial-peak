## Chapter 2516 — True to the Heart

This battle was won far too strangely.

He had clearly felt that much of his attack had been neutralized by the Fiend Lady, and the remaining force shouldn’t have been enough to kill her. Moreover, although there were scraps of clothing left on the arena, there wasn’t a single trace of blood.

Even if she really had been blasted to pieces, there should at least be some blood and bits of flesh left behind, right?

But in reality, nothing at all was left.

Gu Shan was certain the girl wasn't dead.

But if she wasn’t dead, then where was she? Could it really be as the people in the stands said, that she was hiding somewhere, waiting to ambush him? At this thought, Gu Shan’s expression changed, and he hurriedly searched the surroundings, but found no trace of the Fiend Lady hiding anywhere.

Even after a long time, the Fiend Lady never appeared again, and only then did Gu Shan accept the cheers for his victory with a bewildered face.

……

Ten thousand li from Ziyue City, atop a wooden boat, Yang Kai sped along with Zhang Ruoxi, swift as lightning.

After exchanging the final blow with Gu Shan, Yang Kai had flashed onto the arena and brought Zhang Ruoxi out.

The outcome was already decided, there was no need to keep fighting. Gu Shan was spent, while Zhang Ruoxi was unharmed. As long as she got close to Gu Shan, she could easily throw him off the arena.

Now that Yang Kai had reached the Emperor Realm and mastered the mysteries of space, none of the cultivators in Ziyue City had the strength or insight to see through his actions. As a result, it appeared to everyone that Zhang Ruoxi had been utterly destroyed on the arena, leaving behind only a convincing illusion of her being blasted to pieces.

After being brought out by Yang Kai, all of Zhang Ruoxi’s fierce and ruthless aura instantly withdrew, and she became incomparably obedient, quietly standing on the boat, constantly sneaking timid glances at Yang Kai’s back, afraid he would be angry at her recent reckless behavior.

She didn’t know what was wrong with herself. She had never fought anyone before, but after stepping onto the arena, her blood boiled, and every bit of pain and every drop of blood made her feel an indescribable pleasure, as if fighting for her life was her favorite thing.

Every time she returned from the Platform, she would regret it deeply. She felt she shouldn’t be like this—wasn’t it good enough to obediently follow behind Sir? Why did she have to fight and kill? She secretly warned herself that she must never go to the Rising Dragon Platform again.

But as soon as the next day came, that restless feeling in her heart would make her step forward uncontrollably, taking on the identity of the Fiend Lady and heading to the arena, accepting one challenge after another and knocking all her opponents off. She enjoyed the thrill of battle; victory or defeat didn’t matter to her, it was the process she loved.

She was a little afraid of herself, feeling as if a demon was sealed inside her body.

“Do you like using swords?” Yang Kai suddenly asked without turning his head.

“Ah?” Zhang Ruoxi’s body trembled, startled, but she quickly responded, “I don’t really know.”

Yang Kai said, “I noticed that when you fought Gu Shan, you liked to use finger swords. And you have a very strong sword intent.” He paused, then asked, “Have you ever used a sword-shaped Secret Treasure before?”

“No.” Zhang Ruoxi slowly shook her head and said softly, “I’ve never used a Secret Treasure.”

“That’s strange.” Yang Kai looked puzzled. Zhang Ruoxi’s finger sword wasn’t yet refined, but its power was immense, and the sword intent enveloping her was real. Unless one had immersed themselves in swordsmanship for many years, it was impossible to have such presence.

Of all the experts Yang Kai had seen, the one with the strongest sword intent was Chen Wenhao of Tianwu Sacred Land. He had an Imperial Treasure, the Waterflow Sword, and his Three Thousand Sword Dao left a deep impression on Yang Kai to this day.

Yang Kai occasionally used a sword—Myriad Sword was a broad sword—but it wasn’t his specialty. The moves he used were all secret techniques inherent to Myriad Sword, far inferior to Chen Wenhao’s.

But Zhang Ruoxi’s sword intent was completely natural and extremely fierce. Right now, she was like an unpolished gem. If all her potential could be developed, the brilliance she could display would be astonishing.

Suddenly, Yang Kai recalled something.

When Zhang Ruoxi was breaking through to a higher realm, a giant female figure would appear behind her more than once. No one knew who that woman was, but every time, she would open her mouth and swallow the heavenly phenomena that appeared during Zhang Ruoxi’s breakthrough, making her advancement unusually easy.

And when that woman appeared, she would be holding a massive longsword in both hands, an awe-inspiring sight.

Perhaps Zhang Ruoxi’s sword intent and her instinctive use of finger swords were related to that phantom?

It was just a guess, but Yang Kai felt it was very likely.

Since Zhang Ruoxi liked using swords, Yang Kai thought he could let her refine and use Myriad Sword.

That giant female phantom held a broad longsword, and Myriad Sword was the same type. Zhang Ruoxi should like it.

However… Myriad Sword wasn’t actually Yang Kai’s. It was a Qin Family heirloom from Fenglin City. When Old Master Qin entrusted Myriad Sword to Yang Kai, he made it clear that Yang Kai was only to keep it safe and return it when Qin Yu reached the Emperor Realm.

So after thinking it over, Yang Kai dismissed the idea. It wasn’t right to give away someone else’s possession.

It seemed he needed to find a broad sword-type Imperial Treasure. Among his companions, Liu Yan had obtained the Extinction Thunder Bead, Hua Qingsi had the Five-Colored Spear, and even the Incarnation had the Demonic Warhammer—each one an Imperial Treasure.

Naturally, Yang Kai couldn’t favor one over another.

“Sir, I’m sorry. Ruoxi shouldn’t have caused such a big mess without your permission!” Zhang Ruoxi suddenly mustered her courage, lowered her head, and apologized.

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “I’m not blaming you. What’s there to be sorry for?”

Zhang Ruoxi looked up in surprise, “Sir, you’re not angry?”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Your own path is for you to decide. There’s no need to care what others think. As long as you’re true to your heart, that’s enough. Tell me, did you enjoy fighting on that arena?”

“I did!” Zhang Ruoxi nodded vigorously without hesitation.

“Did you kill anyone?”

Zhang Ruoxi shook her head and said, “I always just knocked them off. I never killed anyone.”

“Do you feel guilty?”

Zhang Ruoxi thought for a moment, then shook her head. “No. They simply weren’t skilled enough. Once they stepped onto the platform, they should have been prepared to be knocked off. That’s what I thought when I went up there.”

“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded. “If you think it’s right, then it is. As you grow, there will always be people pointing fingers and gossiping. If what they say makes sense, listen and accept it. If they’re just making trouble, treat it as nonsense. The most important thing is here…” Yang Kai poked his own chest.

“I understand!” Zhang Ruoxi nodded lightly, then suddenly smiled like a flower, delighted, “Traveling with Sir is wonderful.”

……

Half a month later, after many twists and turns, Yang Kai had already ventured deep into the heart of the Eastern Territory.

During this time, Yang Kai traveled together with Zhang Ruoxi, crossing countless rivers and mountains, experiencing the customs and scenery of the Eastern Territory. He guided Zhang Ruoxi in her cultivation along the way, and with her companionship, the journey was far from lonely.

Zhang Ruoxi’s growth was extremely fast. Although her cultivation realm hadn’t improved much, her control over her own strength had advanced greatly, which was closely related to her twenty days of battles on the Rising Dragon Platform.

Fierce battles often stimulate a person’s potential and help them grow quickly.

Although Zhang Ruoxi had grown through her earlier battles, it was the experience and hard-earned lessons that truly remained, settling deep within her and becoming part of her foundation.

During her travels with Yang Kai, she absorbed all that accumulated experience and turned it into nourishment, constantly reflecting on her battles on the arena. It was hard not to make progress.

Yang Kai saw all this but made no comment.

One day, as they were speeding along, Yang Kai suddenly paused, and the boat stopped in midair.

“What’s wrong?” Zhang Ruoxi asked anxiously, releasing her Divine Sense to scan the surroundings.

She thought they had encountered some danger.

But after looking around, there was nothing unusual nearby.

When she looked at Yang Kai again, she saw him take out a golden token from his bosom with a strange expression, and envelop it with his Divine Sense.

In the next moment, Yang Kai’s face changed, turning extremely grim.

Zhang Ruoxi was so frightened she didn’t dare breathe. Since following Yang Kai, she had never seen him so angry. For something to make him this furious, it must be a major event.

That golden token… what was it? Why did Sir have such a strong reaction after checking it?

Zhang Ruoxi was puzzled but didn’t dare ask.

Immediately after, Yang Kai’s terrifying Divine Sense surged out like a tide, instantly covering a vast area.

A moment later, as if he had discovered something, Yang Kai flickered and took Zhang Ruoxi with him, shattering the void and disappearing on the spot.

When they reappeared, Zhang Ruoxi found herself and Yang Kai standing in the air, who knows how far away. Below them, a group of martial artists was besieging a demonic beast that looked like both a turtle and a tiger.

This demonic beast’s yao qi was thick, and it looked to be at the peak of the Eleventh-Tier. In terms of martial artist cultivation, that was the peak of the Dao Origin Realm.

Among those attacking it, only three were Dao Origin Realm, the rest were all Saint King Realm. Even those three Dao Origin Realm cultivators weren’t very strong, only at the First or Second Stage. It looked like some small sect elders had brought their disciples out to train, but for some reason, they’d run into this demonic beast.

It was common for sects to have their disciples train in groups like this, usually accompanied by higher-level elders. The elders protected the disciples and assessed their progress, but unless necessary, they wouldn’t show themselves easily.

There was already a torn corpse lying on the ground, and the surviving martial artists all looked tense and fearful, most of them wounded.

Judging by the situation, they didn’t seem to be a match for the demonic beast.
