## Chapter 540 — Another Misfortune Arises

Still in the same side hall as before, Yang Kai sat at the head, quietly waiting while the leaders and commanders from all the forces within the estate arrived one after another.

After some time, everyone had gathered.

Han Xiao Qi informed Yang Kai with a nod before finding a spot to sit.

Only then did Yang Kai snap out of his reverie, lifting his gaze to look around.

His eyes passed over one familiar face after another.

Dong Qinghan of the Dong Family, Fan Hong and Luo Xiaoman of Ziwei Valley, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu of Yingyue Sect, Zuo Fang of Wen Xin Palace, Chu Jingshan of Fei Yu Pavilion, the four girls of Wan Hua Palace each with distinct temperaments, five elders from the Duanmu Family, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er of Blood Battle Gang, Fang Ziqi of Fengyu Tower, Leng Shan and Shen Yi of Ghost King Valley, Liu Feisheng of Tianyuan City...

Eleven families lending their support—eleven factions. Except for Lingxiao Pavilion itself, all had arrived.

Not only that, Qin Ze from Yao Wang Valley, Wu Yan and Tao Yang of Baoqi Sect also came, and all the Blood Servants had assembled here as well.

The lineup was unprecedentedly grand and powerful.

It was precisely because Yang Kai had summoned everyone that the gravity of the situation dawned on them. Even when he had called people before, he had never summoned the likes of Yao Wang Valley and Baoqi Sect.

A bad feeling settled among them as they silently awaited Yang Kai’s words.

"Junior Brother Yang, if you have something to say, say it quickly. I’m waiting to refine pills,” Qin Ze complained impatiently. He had been studying alchemy with Xia Ningshang recently and the alchemical arts of the Yao Wang Valley disciples had greatly improved. Qin Ze practically lived in the Alchemy Room every day, longing to stay here forever and never return to Yao Wang Valley.

Compared to Yao Wang Valley, this place was truly a sacred sanctuary for an alchemist.

Yang Kai rose to his feet with a faint smile and spoke, “Many have already witnessed the recent events, and I imagine many wonder why Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen have left.”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

Yang Kai continued, “I cannot reveal the exact reasons, but I can tell everyone one thing...”

A hush fell over the assembly.

“There will be trouble at the estate, and it is big trouble.” His tone grew grave.

The crowd was momentarily stunned before breaking into laughter.

Dong Fatty remarked, “Since coming to your estate, there hasn’t been much peace. Whenever something happens, it’s always trouble.”

“Indeed,” Zuo Fang nodded repeatedly. “But no matter the trouble, we’ve always stood together and overcome it. Tell us, what’s the problem this time?”

Their expressions were at ease, showing no sign of tension—they clearly hadn’t grasped the seriousness.

“Trouble that threatens your very lives—even endangering your families or sects.” Yang Kai glanced sharply around. “Do you still find this funny?”

The noisy chatter instantly ceased. All eyes stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“I am not exaggerating. Maybe it’s not as dire as I say... but not far from it.”

“That can’t be true,” Chu Jingshan shook his head repeatedly. “How could this happen? We’ve done nothing wrong. We came here to support you, to participate in the Succession War. How could it threaten our lives or our sects?”

“Precisely because you are helping me.” Yang Kai looked apologetic. “The problem lies with me.”

Han Xiao Qi suddenly interjected, “Is it related to your recent advancement to the Divine Roaming Realm?”

Everyone’s expressions stiffened, suddenly recalling the terrifying evil power and the scene where eight Divine Roaming cultivators and above mobilized as one.

Even now, they remained shaken.

“It’s not the whole reason, but at least part of it.” Yang Kai nodded, speaking with startling frankness. “It is highly probable that because of this, I will become an enemy of the Zhongdu Eight Great Families.”

An uproar erupted—shock and disbelief filled the room.

To be at odds with the Zhongdu Eight Great Families was unthinkable to all.

All the powers joining the Succession War did so precisely to foster good relations with the Eight Great Families. None who gathered at Yang Kai’s estate ever imagined opposing them someday.

It would be like a fly courting death against a mighty beast.

Eyes trembled as they stared at Yang Kai, hoping to detect some joking glint, but none was to be found. His expression was utterly solemn.

“That explains why Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen were taken away,” Yang Kai breathed lightly. “I called you all here today for no other reason than to thank you for your help these days, for perhaps… we shall meet again if fate allows.”

“What do you mean, Yang Kai?” Hu Jiao’er suddenly stood, her beautiful face contorted with anger. “Are you trying to drive us away?”

Yang Kai nodded solemnly. “Yes. Staying here any longer is of no benefit to you.”

“You bastard!” Hu Jiao’er gritted her teeth, glaring fiercely at him. “Who do you think I am? Someone you can summon and banish at will? You dragged us sisters into this estate, and now you want to expel us—why should I listen to you?”

“Sister…” Hu Mei’er anxiously tugged at her, “Yang Kai means well.”

“I’m no fool…” Hu Jiao’er muttered, glaring hatefully at Yang Kai. “But I can’t stand his arrogant, commanding attitude.”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly.

“What a mess,” Qin Ze scoffed, curling his lips. “So it’s just this. Junior Brother Yang, I’ll leave first if there’s nothing else. The Eight Great Families are nothing. If they dare harm anyone from Yao Wang Valley, they would be asking for it.”

With that, he strode off, brazenly dismissive of the Eight Great Families.

The crowd chuckled quietly.

Qin Ze’s confidence was reasonable—though merely a second-rate sect, Yao Wang Valley’s special nature meant the Eight Great Families would not lightly involve themselves with its disciples.

“Yang Kai, how severe is the situation exactly?” Han Xiao Qi asked calmly.

Yang Kai shook his head. “It’s hard to say. Saying I’ll be at odds with the Eight Great Families is plausible because of certain reasons. They want me to yield; I refuse, hence the conflict. But these things are difficult to explain. You’d best leave early and avoid being involved—including all of you from Blood Servants Hall.”

Tu Feng and the others stiffened, exchanging glances before smiling lightly.

Tang Yuxian said, “Young Master, excuse me for speaking bluntly, but don’t underestimate us. Since we follow you, we share life and death and will never retreat. Have you forgotten, Blood Servants Hall is synonymous with loyalty!”

“Death before desertion,” Ying Jiu said coolly.

“We swear to follow the Young Master till death!” the group shouted in unison.

“In that case, I won’t persuade you,” Yang Kai nodded gravely, “To say more would be an insult.”

“If you seniors in Blood Servants Hall don’t leave, neither will I,” Dong Qinghan smiled. “You are my cousin; how could your elder cousin not care for his younger?”

“Yang Kai, we owe you. In your hardship, we will not abandon you.” Han Xiao Qi looked at Yang Kai with some pity, understanding how difficult this decision and proposal must have been.

“Those who have favor, repay favor; those who hold grudges, repay grudges. Wen Xin Palace will not leave either,” Zuo Fang said firmly.

Aside from saving his life in a foreign land, Xia Ningshang had recently refined a Butian Pill to repair Wen Xin Palace’s senior brother Li Xinyuan’s damaged Dantian.

Zuo Fang was deeply grateful and would not abandon Yang Kai at such a time.

“The progress here in the estate has been incredible—pills flowing daily, endless supply of Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures. As for me, I’m not leaving anytime soon,” Fang Ziqi said with a grin.

“Good for nothing,” Hu Jiao’er looked at him with disdain.

“I’m just being honest,” Fang Ziqi shrugged.

“Yang Kai, as long as you don’t drive us away, none of us intend to leave.”

The warriors in the estate echoed one by one, craning their necks and calling out.

Yang Kai smiled, scanning the crowd. He could feel these words were genuine, without pretense.

But perhaps they still harbored some wishful thinking and hadn’t truly grasped the severity.

Yet he could say no more—he could not really expel everyone here; that would be too disheartening.

“Thank you all for your kindness. What I said today is enough for now. I won’t hinder your futures or decisions. Whenever you feel no longer suited to stay, you may leave at will without a single reproach from me.”

“Well, enough said. Saying more could hurt feelings,” Dong Qinghan chimed in, easing the atmosphere.

At last, the crowd began clamoring, probing Yang Kai for details since their interests were at stake. He reluctantly relayed the intentions of Yang Zhen and the others but made no mention of the Wan Yao Ling Ye.

After hearing this, the brows of all tightly furrowed; then they understood the awkwardness of Yang Kai’s predicament.

Because of cultivating evil arts, harboring disciples of the Evil Sect, sharing origins with the Evil Lord, and arousing suspicion and hostility from the Eight Great Families, the situation looked grim indeed.

The Succession War—another unexpected twist.

Originally bolstered by aid from the estate’s supporters, Qiu Yimeng of the Qiu Family was summoned back to Zhongdu, and Huo Xingchen of the Huo Family was captured and confined by the family head personally.

Previously, Xiang Tianxiao of the Xiang Family had also left Yang Kai’s estate.

Meanwhile, whispers ran rampant through War City that Yang Kai colluded with demons and evil spirits.

Within the estate gathered remnants of the Evil Sect Lingxiao Pavilion and disciples of the Evil Sect Ghost King Valley. With cultivation of evil arts, he had nearly fallen into Qi Deviation, causing chaos upon ascending the Divine Roaming Realm, offending eight cultivators beyond that realm, ruthlessly killing heirs of first-rate families, and sharing the same sect origins as the Evil Lord.

All these rumors invoked endless conjecture.

Suddenly, everyone felt this Yang Kai truly was a problem.

There were even rumors that the Yang Family sought to disqualify Yang Kai from participating in the Succession War and competing to be the next family head.

The entire War City became a maelstrom of intrigue and uncertainty.

Though Yang Kai held an undeniable lead twice, each time some cause prevented him from pressing to final victory, eliciting both regret and schadenfreude.

Fortunately, he had not triumphed, for the thought of a demonic heretic as the Yang Family patriarch was unbearable.
