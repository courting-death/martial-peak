## Chapter 842 — Phoenix Nest Lake

The Phoenix Nest wasn't far from Dragon Valley; Yang Kai had been curious what sort of place it was, but upon arrival he found it was, in fact, nothing more than a dense forest.

Viewed from above, the whole forest looked exactly like a phoenix spreading its wings—so lifelike it was uncanny.

And within that dense forest grew nothing but parasol trees, their age unknown. The trunks were unyielding and resilient, rising high into the clouds.

Unlike Dragon Valley, which no one could enter beyond the Dragon Emperor, for the Phoenix Nest there was no such impenetrable force; if an outsider neared Dragon Valley they would be pushed away by an invisible power.

Over the years the Phoenix Nest had shown no particular strangeness; it appeared merely as a common woodland, and many Dragon-Phoenix Palace disciples had once come here to cultivate or rendezvous.

After the Dragon Emperor appeared, Chen Zhou declared the location of the Phoenix Nest a forbidden zone and forbade anyone from approaching.

Sun Yu told Chen Zhou he planned to go investigate the Phoenix Nest; Chen Zhou was overjoyed, assuming Sun Yu meant to search for the Phoenix Empress, and immediately dispatched troops and attendants to escort him.

At the forest fringe Sun Yu found a casual excuse to leave those Transcendent Realm martial artists outside and went into the Phoenix Nest alone.

His status and standing were different now, so those Transcendent Realm figures dared not disobey him; besides, they had all seen Yan Zhi slain with their own eyes and knew the Dragon Emperor's power—so they weren't overly worried about Sun Yu's safety.

Having walked some distance into the forest, a shadow flickered by and Yank Kai appeared.

"So this is the Phoenix Nest?" Yang Kai asked, turning to look around with a trace of suspicion.

"Mm." Sun Yu hurriedly nodded and told Yang Kai the whole story about the Phoenix Nest in detail.

Yang Kai listened carefully, feeling with intent, but said little; he strode off purposefully in a single direction.

He could sense that somewhere within the Phoenix Nest a voice was calling him, and the golden dragon pattern on his body writhed rapidly in response, sending tingles through him.

Sun Yu behaved obediently and followed closely behind Yang Kai.

After a long walk the foliage suddenly opened and a modest lake came into view.

The water was clear and sparkling, but strangely bottomless—some mysterious force seemed to cloak the surface. Yang Kai raised an eyebrow as he peered down from the shore.

He noticed a faint, shimmering reflection in the water: the silhouette of a phoenix, unreal and wavering.

"We call it Phoenix Nest Lake because that vague reflection looks like a phoenix. Lots of people have gone down to investigate over the years, but they never found anything special," Sun Yu explained casually.

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

Some places only reveal their true face to specific people; aside from that person, no one can pry into their secrets, no matter how powerful.

Standing at the lakeside, the golden dragon on Yang Kai's body writhed fiercer and seemed ready to burst forth.

He drew a breath and made no attempt to suppress it.

After a moment, accompanied by a dragon's roar, the golden dragon pattern materialized into a real form and shot out.

This golden dragon was much smaller than the one that had fought Yan Zhi before; now it measured only about one zhang in length.

After emerging from Yang Kai's body it circled in the air a few times and then plunged headfirst toward Phoenix Nest Lake.

Water rippled and the golden dragon disappeared without a trace.

Sun Yu's face flushed with excitement; he watched intently, his spirits subtly stirred.

Only he in the Dragon-Phoenix Palace knew the Dragon Emperor's secret, and having been personally trained by the true Dragon Emperor he felt proud. Now, possibly on the verge of witnessing the Phoenix Empress's inheritance, Sun Yu—being a disciple of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace—could hardly contain his excitement.

The golden dragon sank into the lake and before long the surface began to roil; it seemed some vast energy was erupting from below as the water rose.

Ripples spread outward and the phoenix-shaped reflection in the lake warped, as if it were flapping its wings and preparing to burst from the bottom and fly heavenward.

Points of phosphorescent light suddenly drifted in from all directions and fell drop by drop into the lake.

Each mote of light contained subtle, wondrous power!

Yang Kai and Sun Yu were astonished and quickly scanned the surroundings, both shaken by what they saw.

The lights were actually emanating from the phoenix wutong trees inside the Phoenix Nest; when Yang Kai arrived he had not noticed anything special about those trees.

The entire Phoenix Nest burst into radiance as countless glimmers like fireflies rose from the wood and converged toward Phoenix Nest Lake from all directions.

The Transcendent Realm masters waiting outside the Phoenix Nest widened their eyes and stared, unable to contain their excitement.

Even Chen Zhou, who had been handling affairs within the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, hurried out and gazed toward the Phoenix Nest, laughing up at the sky.

"The Dragon Emperor's successor has appeared; now the Phoenix Nest stirs—indeed, the Phoenix Empress's arrival must be near," he exclaimed.

He abandoned whatever matters were unfinished, then streaked toward the Phoenix Nest. Within the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, the other experts had no mind to work and followed their Palace Master en masse to witness the Phoenix Empress's inheritance.

By the lake, Yang Kai waited quietly while Sun Yu watched the lights falling into the water with bright eyes, lingering over the scene as if it were a fairyland.

Standing at the shore, Sun Yu clearly felt a profound change in the world's energies.

A heavy sense of majesty was rising from the bottom of the lake.

Long moments passed before all the drifting lights had been absorbed into the lake; the phoenix-shaped reflection within the water seemed to come alive, its wings beating ever more fiercely.

Suddenly the lake erupted skyward.

In the spray, a magnificent golden dragon and a ghostly blue Ice Phoenix appeared together.

Dragon roars and phoenix cries resounded through heaven and earth—the former sonorous, the latter clear—reaching far into the depths of the world.

Yang Kai cracked a smile and fixed his gaze ahead.

Like true dragons, phoenixes are also the uncrowned sovereigns of the yao and can, in legend, achieve Ninth-Tier transcendence.

Now, with dragon and phoenix presenting auspicious omens, the golden dragon danced constantly while the Ice Phoenix hovered serenely above the lake; its bright eyes shone with wisdom as if it were appraising Yang Kai.

After a moment the Ice Phoenix uttered a soft cry that conveyed satisfaction.

Then the Ice Phoenix trembled, dissolved into motes of light, and drifted away until it vanished.

Phoenix Nest Lake calmed once more and the golden dragon that had shot out returned to Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai closed his eyes to feel, his emotions stirring.

This inheritance belonged to Su Yan, but she currently resided in the Ice Sect; he would have to find her first before she could claim any of what this place offered.

Seeing Yang Kai remain still, Sun Yu also held his breath and did not dare disturb him.

After a long while Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and said, "Sun Yu, help me with something."

Sun Yu straightened and said earnestly, "Senior, say what you wish."

"Have your people in the Dragon-Phoenix Palace keep a careful watch over this Phoenix Nest."

"You can rest assured, Senior—Sun Yu will not let anyone harm this place."

"Good."

Sun Yu chuckled and then asked, "Senior, do you intend to leave these things here for someone?"

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise. "You can tell?"

"Senior, your aura just now grew very gentle; I thought you must have remembered someone... If there's no mistake, that person should be your companion."

"Not bad observation for a kid." Yang Kai gave a wry laugh and said lightly, "Alright, the matter here is settled—it's time for me to leave."

"Ah—you're leaving already?" Sun Yu couldn't hide a trace of reluctance.

He owed all his achievements to Yang Kai; had it not been for the chance two years ago, he would at best be a First Stage Divine Roaming cultivator now, perhaps not even that, and his talent wouldn't be so outstanding.

With Sun Yu's own aptitude, even with all his effort in life he might have only broken through to Transcendent Realm.

But now he could clearly feel that becoming Transcendent and ascending to saintly heights was only a matter of time.

It was all thanks to Yang Kai, and Sun Yu felt deeply grateful.

"I must go; I have many matters to attend to. We'll meet again when fate allows." Yang Kai nodded.

"Take care, Senior. Next time we meet, Sun Yu will not disappoint you!" Sun Yu said earnestly, clasping his fists in salute. "I will train diligently to live up to your guidance!"

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said no more; with a blur of movement he was gone.

Sun Yu watched Yang Kai's departing direction with a momentary melancholy, then turned and left the forest.

When he reached the outside of the Phoenix Nest and saw what awaited him, Sun Yu was startled.

Every expert in the palace had poured out and gathered there, all assembled under Palace Master Chen Zhou's watchful eye, staring this way with eager faces.

As Sun Yu emerged, one after another the onlookers showed curiosity and expectation.

"Palace Master, Master..." Sun Yu clasped his hands and saluted.

Chen Zhou hastened to return the salute and asked cautiously, "Has the Dragon Emperor's inheritor shown signs? Has the Phoenix Empress's inheritance manifested?"

They had all seen the commotion within the Phoenix Nest and naturally had their guesses.

Sun Yu forced himself to say, "A little."

"What do you mean?" Chen Zhou asked with joy.

"Um..." Sun Yu hesitated, then an idea flashed through his mind and he said, "There are no disciples within the palace suitable to receive the Phoenix Empress's inheritance, and the time is not right."

"What?" Chen Zhou was disappointed and asked anxiously, "Then when will it be?"

Sun Yu shook his head. "When the destined person comes, they will come—it's something I can't say."

His answer was ambiguous and left him uneasy, but when he looked around the palace's experts they all wore thoughtful expressions and nodded slightly, seemingly satisfied with his words.

Sun Yu felt relieved and said leisurely, "I'm going into seclusion; you needn't worry about the Phoenix Empress—when she is meant to appear, she will."

"Yes." Chen Zhou nodded and added, "Oh, Dragon Emperor, about how to handle the Youhan Grotto-Heaven—please give us your opinion."

"Palace Master, handle it as you see fit." Sun Yu smiled wryly; such a weighty matter wasn't for him to decide lightly.

Hearing that, Chen Zhou asked no more; he and the others accompanied Sun Yu back to the Dragon-Phoenix Palace to prepare the best provisions and resources and arrange for him to enter the forbidden area and begin seclusion to cultivate.
