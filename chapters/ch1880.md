## Chapter 1880 — Delving into the Void

Kuang Shizong had seen Yang Kai employ spatial techniques before and knew of the latter's abilities, yet he could never have imagined that Yang Kai's spatial force could not only make him come and go without a trace but could actually cause an Origin-Grade Upper-Level warship to instantaneously shift its position.

This was no longer something human strength could accomplish; it was nothing short of a miracle!

It was precisely because of this that the devastating Crystal Cannon salvo had produced no effect.

While Kuang Shizong was momentarily stunned, Yang Kai's low voice came from over there: "Since you, senior, are so obstinate, then pay the price!"

"No good!" Kuang Shizong shouted in alarm. Although he did not know exactly what method Yang Kai intended to use, he instinctively felt unease, as if whatever Yang Kai was about to unleash was not something he could possibly resist.

"Quick — raise the defenses to maximum!" Kuang Shizong roared.

The warrior at the controls of the Void King-Grade Warship dared not delay; he formed a hand-seal and poured power into the formation. In the next moment, an outer energy barrier as dense as solid matter suddenly manifested around the Void King-Grade Warship. The barrier looked impregnable — even a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert's full-strength blow would be utterly incapable of breaking it.

Even so, Kuang Shizong remained deeply unsettled; his pores constricted and a palpitation of dread lingered in his chest.

A thread of purple light suddenly shimmered ahead.

That purple light was not dazzling; compared with the earlier volley of hundreds of Crystal Cannons, it was like a firefly contesting brilliance with a bright moon — utterly negligible.

Yet the instant that purple light flared, Kuang Shizong abruptly held his breath. He widened his eyes and stared at the purple glow, feeling as if he had fallen into an ice cellar, chilled through.

From the source of that purple light he actually sensed an authority that made him submit and extinguished any thought of resistance.

"Imperial Might!" Even as a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert, Kuang Shizong immediately grasped what kind of presence that commanding power represented.

From the wellspring of that purple light, the force of Imperial Might radiated outward!

Doesn’t this mean… the other party is holding an Imperial Treasure?

An Imperial Treasure — that thing said to exist only in legend, as ephemeral as the Starry Sky Emperor, a relic far beyond the Void King-Grade!

If it truly was an Imperial Treasure, then the Void King-Grade Warship likely could not withstand it.

The thought arose, and Kuang Shizong suddenly bellowed, "Anyone who doesn't want to die, get out of here!"

Saying so, he charged straight for the hatch; not waiting for his men to open it, he smashed it with a single punch, tearing a huge hole in the sturdy door, and then shot out into the Starry Sky.

Kuang Shizong was the supreme existence on the Purple Star. Seeing that even he was so terrified, the other warriors dared not linger; they followed him and fled through the breach in the hatch.

In the distance, Yang Kai held the Extinction Thunder Bead in his hand, his expression solemn as he watched the pursuing Void King-Grade Warship; his Saint Yuan poured inward like a flood released from a dam.

The Extinction Thunder Bead shimmered with light, its purple hue rich; a fine, threadlike arc of electricity within the bead leapt as Yang Kai's Saint Yuan flooded in.

Sss...

At a certain moment, when his Saint Yuan had been poured in to a sufficient degree, the leaping arc suddenly burst out of the Extinction Thunder Bead. Under Yang Kai's Divine Sense control it tore through the Starry Sky like a comet, or like a purple long arrow loosed from a bow, heading straight for the Purple Star's Void King-Grade Warship.

Soundlessly, that purple arc struck the external barrier of the Void King-Grade Warship; the barrier that had seemed as solid as iron and able to withstand a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert's full-strength blow quietly dissolved and opened a large hole.

Immediately after, the hull was pierced, a passage torn through from side to side, and the barrier on the opposite side was likewise breached...

The lingering might of the purple arc remained undiminished and it streaked toward one of the nine warships that had been trailing behind.

Boom...

A tremendous roar erupted; that Origin-Grade Upper-Level warship had no time to evade — the instant the purple arc struck it, it shattered into fragments, collapsing utterly in the blink of an eye.

Only then did the lead Void King-Grade Warship begin to emit cracking sounds.

The external barriers arranged around it split like broken mirrors, countless fissures spreading before they vanished; the colossal hull itself was nearly cleft in two.

Fortunately, the materials consumed in forging that Void King-Grade Warship had all been of the utmost value, so despite the damage it did not explode on the spot — yet the warship was effectively ruined, and repairing it would cost untold wealth, manpower, and time.

In the Starry Sky, Kuang Shizong — who had fled first — stared blankly at the scene, his hands and feet icy, his face ashen; he muttered unconsciously, "It really is an Imperial Treasure, it really is an Imperial Treasure!"

He could never have imagined that Yang Kai not only possessed outstanding personal strength, but also commanded a crew of strange contrivances, was adept in Spatial Force, and furthermore owned an Imperial Treasure!

Any warrior who possessed even one of the things Yang Kai had would be able to run rampant across the Starry Sky — yet he had them all!

Was there anyone in this world who could match him? Even though Kuang Shizong's cultivation was a step above Yang Kai's and he already stood on the pinnacle of the Star Domain's Martial Dao, now faced with the heaven-defying methods Yang Kai had revealed one by one, a profound sense of helplessness rose within him.

Mastery of Spatial Force had already set Yang Kai on an invincible path; throughout this Star Domain there was likely no one who could slay him. With such means at his back, if he did not go looking for trouble it would be a mercy — who would dare to court his misfortune?

For an instant, panic surged in Kuang Shizong's heart — a feeling he had not experienced for many years and had nearly forgotten.

He wanted to retreat!

Since he could not kill Yang Kai and could not withstand the Imperial Treasure's attack, pressing on would only invite disaster.

But when he looked toward where Yang Kai stood, his expression brightened and he cried, "Fire! No matter what, stop him!"

He had plainly noticed that after releasing that Imperial Treasure strike, Yang Kai's complexion had not looked good either.

He immediately understood that while an Imperial Treasure's power was peerless, the cost to use it was enormous; with Yang Kai's strength he probably could not employ it a second time.

Kuang Shizong's guess was correct.

Yang Kai truly could not make use of the Extinction Thunder Bead's latent power again.

He had used the Extinction Thunder Bead several times before; every time he used it his strength improved markedly, but each use left him exhausted and his Divine Sense parched.

Although as his strength rose the Extinction Thunder Bead could unleash ever greater power, the experience was nonetheless extremely taxing.

Perhaps only someone at Yang Yan's level could fully bring the Extinction Thunder Bead's power to bear and use it without risk.

After unleashing the Extinction Thunder Bead's strike, Yang Kai immediately bit down and crushed the spiritual pill he had been holding in his mouth.

The trickle of medicine dissolved into a sweet, clear liquid, flowed down his throat into his stomach, dispersing through his limbs and allowing him to recover some Saint Yuan and Divine Sense in a very short time.

At that very moment, Kuang Shizong's order had just been issued!

The eight remaining intact Origin-Grade Upper-Level warships all simultaneously trained their Crystal Cannons on Yang Kai's position; every attack was locked onto the Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship.

Light flared as energy capable of destroying heaven and earth was nurtured aboard the eight ships.

Yang Kai's face remained indifferent as he stood on the hull and met Kuang Shizong's gaze from afar, speaking coldly, "Senior, this trip to the Purple Star displeased me. If fate allows, I will come by to visit again — I hope you live long. By all means don't die too soon."

Those words seared into Kuang Shizong's heart like a branding iron, jolting him; whenever he thought of Yang Kai's sky-reaching methods, he realized that if he let him go now, the Purple Star would suffer for it later.

Under his anxious stare, Yang Kai turned and thrust both hands forward.

A horrifying thing occurred.

Yang Kai's hands actually plunged directly into the void, as if an invisible wall stood before him and his arms had reached through to the other side.

Then Yang Kai exerted force and split his hands apart to both sides.

Ka-cha ka-cha...

A vast spatial rift leisurely yawned open; the scene looked as if Yang Kai had simply torn cloth — effortless, simple, and striking.

The rift gaped like a great beast's maw, and within it lay chaotic nothingness.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship slowly steered into it.

Kuang Shizong's face went deathly pale; he stared at the ship heading into the void, his Saint Yuan surging several times, yet in the end he did not make a move.

He knew even if he acted he absolutely could not stop them, and might himself be dragged into the void.

Yang Kai was versed in Spatial Force and need not fear becoming lost in the void; Kuang Shizong was different — even a Third Stage of the Void King Realm could become forever lost in a spatial rift, unable to find a way out.

All that remained in Kuang Shizong's heart was dense resentment and dread.

He resented that on this trip he had not only failed to recover what had been lost from the Treasure Vault, but that Yang Kai had destroyed an Origin-Grade Upper-Level warship and damaged a Void King-Grade Warship.

He trembled at Yang Kai's final harsh words — that the Purple Star had thus raised so formidable an enemy; the outlook was bleak!

The Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship soon vanished into the void, and the opened rift closed with great speed.

Only then did the eight Purple Star warships' Crystal Cannons belatedly unleash their volleys.

The combined force of those thousands of Crystal Cannon shots exceeded even the earlier burst from the Void King-Grade Warship.

Yet every shot struck empty space, flying off into the far reaches of the Starry Sky!

Ahead there was no longer any trace of the Hengluo Commerce Guild warship or of Yang Kai.

Kuang Shizong stood there in a daze, as if he had aged several hundred years in an instant...

The remaining eight warships also fell silent, not knowing what to do.

After a long while, many experts flew out of the ships and gathered before Kuang Shizong, each wearing an anxious expression as they looked at him.

"Ah!" Kuang Shizong sighed deeply and offered a self-mocking laugh, "Truly, each generation brings forth its talent — I suppose I must admit I am growing old."

"Patriarch..." The crowd was startled; they knew Kuang Shizong had been thoroughly shaken by Yang Kai and wished to comfort him but did not know how to begin.
