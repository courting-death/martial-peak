## Chapter 1331 — Tianyun City Lord

No one expected that Yang Kai would actually kill Xie Quan, whom he had captured.

The reason those Origin Returning Realm experts had not acted rashly before was partly because they feared the artifact spirit Fire Bird, and partly because of Xie Quan; with Xie Quan subdued by Yang Kai they were naturally cautious, fearing that any misstep would provoke Yang Kai to kill — after all, they had already seen Yang Kai's ruthlessness earlier — and if Xie Quan really died, they would have no way to answer to Xie Li.

But now that concern vanished in an instant, and the reason was—Yang Kai himself had acted. This left them both surprised and furious; only then did they realize they'd completely underestimated this youth's madness and utter contempt for others!

Without Xie Quan as a hostage, did he think a single Saint King Realm could stand here and speak on equal terms with so many Origin Returning Realm experts? Worse, if Xie Quan and those Xie Family disciples were dead it would rile Xie Li and none of them would be safe. Ma Xinyuan pointed at Yang Kai from afar, jabbed his finger as if too angry to speak, and after a long moment ground his teeth: "Kid, you're dead for sure — this time you're really finished."

"Brother Ma, don't waste words with him; seize him and hand him to Deacon Xie — that's the proper thing to do," someone nearby snapped coldly.

"With just you lot?" Yang Kai laughed arrogantly. If Chang Qi and Yu Feng and the others were still here he might have been wary, but he was alone here now; even if a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm were present they couldn't hold him — having cultivated spatial power he could tear the space and escape at any time.

This time it wasn't like the last time in the Corpse Den where he brought along Yang Yan and faced off against a Thousand-Year Corpse General level opponent.

There were only seven or eight First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm here — trying to keep him was pure fantasy.

"I'll tear this Tianyun City apart first and settle accounts with you later!" Yang Kai's voice turned icy, he pointed, and growled, "Burn it for me!"

The artifact spirit Fire Bird received the order, gave a long cry to the heavens, its flames surging as the world's fire-type spiritual qi once more flowed into its body. In the blink of an eye its size seemed to swell considerably.

Seeing this, many Origin Returning Realm experts' faces paled; they all circulated Saint Yuan to cloak themselves, then produced their defensive secret treasures for protection.

The next moment the Fire Bird opened its beak, and a dazzling ball of light formed within, which it promptly expelled. An overwhelmingly forceful blaze shot out, its contained heat seeming to melt space itself — horrifying to behold — and it hurtled straight toward the street below.

The artifact spirit's target wasn't any person, but the largest-looking shop nearby.

Yang Kai was determined to turn Tianyun City upside down — the people of Dragon Lair Mountain had been bullied to this extent. He wouldn't let it go; if he backed down now he'd only appear weak and be preyed upon even more in the future.

After all, this was the first real confrontation Dragon Lair Mountain had had with others since its founding!

Before the blaze reached the shop, its high temperature had already set the place alight. The next moment, a mysterious light shot from afar and, arriving after but striking first, pierced into the shop, and instantly a film-like energy shield wrapped the building tightly.

It was the shop's defensive restriction — a kind of protective formation. In Tianyun City any decently sized shop had one; their strength varied with the owner's wealth.

This shop's restriction was clearly not weak; the energy dome shimmered with a green glow like rippling water — evidently set up with care.

Even so, when the flames struck the restriction it sent the formation rocking, nearly breaking it open; the green light dimmed in an instant and, after less than two breaths, shattered with a roar.

The blaze's momentum did not abate; it lunged straight at the shop.

At that moment a secret treasure resembling a round bowl suddenly flew over, expanding in midair to a diameter of over ten zhang and positioning itself directly above the shop.

The flames, taken off-guard, rushed into the bowl; immediately a blue light blossomed within, gathering the fire into a mass and suppressing it. A middle-aged scholar-dressed man bizarrely appeared above the bowl; with an extremely grave expression he poured several waves of Saint Yuan into the bowl. With Divine Sense guiding it, the bowl quickly contracted back to its original size.

The middle-aged scholar waved his hand and drew the bowl back, staring blankly at the roiling flames within, his face sour.

"Finally you show yourself!" Yang Kai snorted coldly; he made no other move but stood and stared at the middle-aged scholar.

He'd sensed the other's presence as soon as he stepped into Tianyun City — after all, the man had cultivation at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

Aside from him, there were no other experts in Tianyun City Yang Kai feared; otherwise he wouldn't have acted so wantonly before.

What puzzled him was that no matter what he did, the man hadn't intended to show himself — yet Yang Kai kept an eye on him, and now, with the shop on the verge of destruction, the man finally couldn't help but appear.

Yang Kai still couldn’t tell whether this person was an enemy or a friend, but instinctively he felt that the man bore him no ill will—otherwise, he would have already made a move long ago.

"Blue Jade Bowl!"

"Lord Fei!"

The First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm fighters all shouted; at their cry Yang Kai immediately understood who the middle-aged scholar was.

Tianyun City Lord, Fei Zhi Tu!

Yang Kai hadn't dealt with him but had heard the name. Over two years ago when he had conflicts with the Haike Family and the Xu Family, members of those two families came to the city lord's mansion for aid, but in the end neither saw Fei Zhi Tu; instead Ian, head of the Haike Family, happened upon Xie Hongwen at the mansion and dragged him into that dispute.

Yang Kai learned of him from Wu Yi, just not expecting that this man would be a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Looking at him, Yang Kai finally showed a hint of apprehension — that Blue Jade Bowl in his hand could absorb the Fire Bird's attack, clearly not a trifling artifact, and the man's aura was profound, seemingly not much inferior to Qian Tong.

That he could act freely beneath the gazes of seven or eight First Stage Origin Returning Realm experts didn't mean he could do the same before a Third Stage expert; yet before figuring out the man's stance Yang Kai had no intention to retreat — he still kept his trump cards in reserve, whether the Space Blade or the Bloom Lotus technique, his confident tools.

The goat-bearded elder and the others' faces shifted upon recognizing Fei Zhi Tu; they hurried forward to pay respects. Ma Xinyuan's expression fluttered as he said, "Lord, weren't you said to be in seclusion cultivating a secret art? Has it been completed already?"

Fei Zhi Tu glanced at him leisurely and said lightly, "What, Deacon Ma takes such an interest in this city lord's secret art?"

"Of course not, of course not — I merely asked in passing," Ma Xinyuan replied awkwardly, not daring to say more.

“Hmph!” Fei Zhi Tu swept his gaze around, letting his eyes pass over each of the First Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivators, and said mockingly, “If this City Lord hadn’t come out now, were you all planning to tear down my Tianyun City?”

"Forgive us, Lord!" The crowd flinched and hurriedly cupped their fists. One stepped forward to explain, "But there are reasons — the shops didn't end up like this because of us; it's this kid's arrogance, killing and burning here. We ask the city lord to judge!"

As he spoke he pointed off at Yang Kai.

Fei Zhi Tu turned to Yang Kai and found the youth calmly meeting his gaze without fear; he couldn't help but click his tongue in surprise, then his face darkened as he barked, "A bunch of trash — you can't even handle a Saint King Realm kid. What face do you have to live on, pretending you're Origin Returning Realm? In my view you've lived like dogs these years."

The seven or eight Origin Returning Realm all lowered their heads in silence, stifled with humiliation.

After scolding them, Fei Zhi Tu chuckled, "Kid, you have guts, daring to kill and burn in my Tianyun City — you really don't put this city lord in your eyes, do you?"

"I ask your discernment, elder — truly this lot are faithless and bully others beyond measure; I had no choice but to resist a little!" Yang Kai said with indifference.

"A little resistance..." Fei Zhi Tu's eye twitched. Having watched the whole thing from hiding he had only seen Yang Kai's unbridled arrogance and a group of Origin Returning Realm being toyed with — what resistance? He thought the kid was shamelessly lying, and in a cold voice said, "I heard you just now say you'd tear my Tianyun City apart?"

Yang Kai grinned, "Elder, forgive me — I was just enraged and spoke without thinking. You are magnanimous; you wouldn't take it to heart, would you?"

Fei Zhi Tu took a deep breath and gave a cold laugh. “Whether you spoke rashly or not, this City Lord doesn’t care. A real man stands by his words. Today, either you truly topple my Tianyun City, or this City Lord will mark a path for you himself—but otherwise, don’t even think about leaving here unscathed.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s expression darkened slightly, but after a brief moment of contemplation, he smiled again and said, “Since Senior puts it that way, then this junior will be bold—please give your instruction!”

With such a master present he certainly couldn't keep causing trouble, though he detected a hint of something different in the man's words — this Fei Zhi Tu didn't seem to be an enemy.

The others were not fools; they could hear the subtext in Fei Zhi Tu's words — the city lord clearly intended to turn swords into plowshares. Ma Xinyuan and the others were startled and about to intervene when Fei Zhi Tu loudly spoke, "You've killed people and burned many shops; even if my Yingyue Hall was at fault first, you've vented your grievance. I could have left it at that, but I cannot simply let you go — otherwise word will spread and outsiders will think this city lord cowardly and timid."

"I understand!" Yang Kai lightly nodded.
