## Chapter 464 — Let Me Give It a Try

Just now, Yang Wei obviously sensed something amiss, which was why he immediately ordered the Blood Servants to retreat. But even then, his warning came a bit too late.

Yang Wei definitely knew the secret behind all this.

When Yang Zhao asked about it, Yang Wei’s expression remained indifferent, showing no intention to reveal the truth outright. Yet, when he turned and saw Liu Qingyao caught in the entanglement of blue energy, frozen in place and unable to move, his brows furrowed and he gave a slight nod.

Revealing these details would do no great harm. Moreover, even if Yang Wei remained silent, anyone could inquire with the Blood Servants upon returning and soon learn the truth.

Although Liu Qingyao’s Water Moon Azure Wave Armor shielded him from the blue energy’s invasive corruption, he could hardly dispel such an insidious attack immediately. Seeing Yang Wei nod, he naturally shifted his gaze and listened carefully.

“Our Yang Family has four Grand Elders, all beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, plus the clan head, making five in total,” Yang Wei said calmly. “The other Seven Great Families are roughly the same. But those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm are mostly aged men who seldom engage in combat. Even during the war against Cangyun Evil Land, only one or two of them took action. Among them is a Grand Elder famous across the world for his binding techniques—he comes from the Blood Servants Hall!”

“Huang Jiuzhou?” Yang Zhao asked in surprise.

Among the Yang Family’s Grand Elders, only one hails from the Blood Servants Hall. When young, he was a Blood Servant of the Yang Family, but after great meritorious deeds and breaking through beyond the Divine Roaming Realm to the Martial Peak, he was appointed Grand Elder of the clan.

His name is known throughout the entire Yang Family, and even all the Blood Servants now regard him as their role model, hoping one day to reach the heights of Huang Jiuzhou.

“That’s right,” Yang Wei nodded, pointing at Liu Qingyao. “These methods came from him! The Sealing Yuan Curse—it traps one’s True Yuan within the meridians, utterly unusable!”

“So he was behind this,” Yang Zhao suddenly understood, his face turning grim. “What about our Blood Servants...?”

“They are also trapped by the Sealing Yuan Curse. Although they possess the strength to break it, it will definitely take no less than two or three months!” Yang Wei explained softly.

The few members of the Yang Family present all frowned deeply.

Normally, everyone had just two Blood Servants around—one to protect themselves and one to guard the command flag. Now, one of them had been incapacitated by Huang Jiuzhou’s treacherous technique. Whether attacking or defending, their effective strength would suffer accordingly.

Thinking of this, they all glanced enviously at Yang Kai.

Only Yang Kai managed to gather three Blood Servants under him, so he could afford such losses.

Huang Jiuzhou’s planting of the Sealing Yuan Curse on the eight Mystery-Grade treasures was clearly the Yang Family’s design, meant to accelerate the succession war’s progress. With six Blood Servants sidelined, the situation would become somewhat clearer.

“Serves you right!” Yang Kang looked at Liu Qingyao, who floated in midair struggling with the Sealing Yuan Curse, his face full of schadenfreude. “Young Master Liu, even our Blood Servants can’t withstand the Sealing Yuan Curse. I suggest you accept your fate and hand over that treasure. This time, the brothers won’t make things difficult for you.”

Liu Qingyao’s face remained cold; he merely snorted lightly and ignored the remark.

Yang Kang grew annoyed. He barked, “Liu Qingyao, don’t be shameless. This treasure war concerns the Yang Family alone—what business do you have meddling in it?”

“A Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure—I want it too!” Liu Qingyao finally spoke, his tone neither hot nor cold, showing no sign of panic despite being trapped.

Mystery-Grade treasures are rare; the number the Yang Family produced this time was significant, likely contributed by each of the Eight Great Families to equal the count. It was no wonder Liu Qingyao was tempted to join the plunder.

This explained why he had come here. However, no one expected the eight treasures to conceal not only fierce forbidden seals but also Huang Jiuzhou’s Sealing Yuan Curse. Both struck simultaneously, ensnaring the Blood Servants.

“Since you say so, don’t blame me for being rude.” Yang Kang sneered and glanced around. “Shall we first snatch the treasure from Young Master Liu’s hands?”

The cursed treasure in Liu Qingyao’s grip had already triggered its seals and curse, making it ready for use if seized. The remaining treasure had fallen into Po Jing Lake and was temporarily unreachable.

Yang Kang’s proposal greatly tempted Yang Shen and Yang Ying, who both eagerly awaited a chance.

In his prime, they would not have dared scheme against Liu Qingyao. But now, just resisting the Sealing Yuan Curse left him struggling; he had no strength left to fight others.

Yang Wei remained silent, but Yang Zhao smiled faintly, his true thoughts unknown.

Yang Kang felt awkward asking them and turned to Yang Kai. “Ninth Brother, say something.”

Yang Kai shrugged. “Suit yourselves.”

“Ninth Brother!” Yang Kang suddenly darkened. “Though we are rivals, you should at least show some face for Fifth Brother. The treasures he snatched were rightfully ours.”

Yang Kai responded coldly, “If I want something, I will take it myself.”

“Fine!” Yang Kang sneered and turned his gaze back to Liu Qingyao. “Young Master Liu, don’t struggle—it’s useless.”

Liu Qingyao snorted softly, then his True Yuan surged violently. His Water Moon Azure Wave Armor flickered; the river, fish, and crescent moon patterns gradually became illusory and ethereal.

Yang Kang and the others’ faces changed drastically. They shouted, “Liu Qingyao, are you mad? That is a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure!”

Liu Qingyao said nothing, continuing to channel his True Yuan.

Crack—

The river pattern on the Water Moon Azure Wave Armor shattered suddenly, and with its disappearance, the Sealing Yuan Curse’s seal dimmed noticeably.

Crack—

The crescent moon vanished; the curse’s seal again grew faint.

Crack—

The fish shattered, and the blue Sealing Yuan Curse broke apart like a fractured mirror with a booming explosion.

The Water Moon Azure Wave Armor worn by Liu Qingyao turned to flying ash, dispersing piece by piece.

Glowing specks floated down from the sky, slowly darkening. A Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure had met its end.

Like a tiger breaking free, Liu Qingyao let out a fierce shout under the incredulous stares of all: “A trivial Sealing Yuan Curse dares to bind me, Liu Qingyao? How little the Yang Family must think of me!”

Yang Kang and the others’ eyes trembled violently as they stared at the First Young Master of Zhongdu, shaking their heads bitterly in disbelief.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed sharply, secretly admiring Liu Qingyao’s tenacity. This man was clearly sturdy and unyielding, a spirit that would rather break than bend.

The six Blood Servants had no solution against the Sealing Yuan Curse, not due to lack of strength but because they lacked Liu Qingyao’s solid foundation.

Liu Qingyao had sacrificed his Water Moon Azure Wave Armor to shatter the Sealing Yuan Curse’s fetters—a great price indeed.

Besides, not every treasure would have this ability. The Water Moon Azure Wave Armor evidently possessed this special power.

“Will each of you fight me one-on-one, or attack together? I, Liu, will accept your challenge!” Liu Qingyao’s eyes swept the six spread around him, full of arrogant confidence.

Yang Kang’s expression turned awkward.

He had just belittled Liu Qingyao; now that the tide had turned, he dared not be the first to rise. If defeated here, his face would be utterly lost.

Yang Shen and Yang Ying also wore grim expressions, glancing at Yang Wei, hoping he would speak.

Liu Qingyao had opened the challenge; if none answered, it would be a disgrace to the Yang Family. News spreading would paint the young generation of the Yang Family as weaklings.

“The treasure is here!” Liu Qingyao held the treasure snatched earlier, sneering lightly. “Whoever takes three blows from me shall have this treasure as a gift from me personally!”

Repeated provocations cast a dark shadow over the Yang Family disciples.

Even the usually composed Yang Zhao showed signs of anger.

Though the clash among brothers was internal strife, Liu Qingyao’s arrogant words were a slap in the face—how could he tolerate it?

Yet, among those present, the strongest was Yang Wei, who was at the Divine Roaming Realm, two stages. After having fought Liu Qingyao before, he should know some background. Even he dared not casually accept Liu Qingyao’s challenge, so no one else dared to respond.

Everyone felt deeply awkward, especially carrying the reputation of the top Yang Family of Zhongdu.

Yang Wei frowned, knowing this standoff solved nothing. Liu Qingyao had thrown down the gauntlet; if no one answered, spectators would look down on the Yang Family.

Just as he prepared to answer himself, bearing the embarrassment to preserve the family’s honor, Yang Kai smiled slightly, stepped forward through the void, and said casually, “Anyone can take three of your blows?”

Liu Qingyao frowned, seemingly surprised the first to respond was Yang Kai, but nodded seriously, “Exactly.”

“Take three blows and the treasure is mine?”

“Yes.”

“Then it’s settled—I’ll give it a try!” Yang Kai nodded lightly, showing no sign of nervousness.

At this, Yang Wei hurriedly said, “Ninth Brother, don’t be impulsive.”

“No matter,” Yang Kai waved his hand. “Big Brother, just watch. Actually, the Yang Family is not so easily bullied.”

Yang Wei was stunned.

Yang Zhao and the others were also taken aback, not understanding where his confidence came from. Although previous battles had shown Yang Kai’s strength was not weak, the current opponent was no ordinary person—the number one figure in Zhongdu’s reputation!

Everyone thought Yang Kai must have lost his mind in a fit of rage.

At the True Yuan Realm’s eighth stage facing a Divine Roaming Realm third stage expert, such a gap made winning seem impossible.

They didn’t even know what Yang Kai relied upon. The Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure was just seized and unusable without refining.
