## Chapter 2014 — Return


The woman herself was not an ordinary Void King cultivator, and now, standing on the verge of a breakthrough, the strike she unleashed carried power ordinary Void King cultivators could not withstand.

Yang Kai took the blow unharmed, using its momentum to fall back faster — the movement gave the woman a rough estimate of his strength.

“The little Fenglin City actually has warriors like this?” the woman asked, brows knitted in surprise.

But she soon had no time for thought; the heaven-and-earth baptism for a major breakthrough was about to descend, and she could only hold her breath and steel herself to face it.

Before long, in the sky, tremendous energies struck down like thunder, falling toward the place where the woman stood.

...


Yang Kai fled roughly a hundred li before slowly coming to a stop.

He did not know what power the woman at the Third Stage truly possessed, nor how she had entered this place; but since he'd already taken many benefits from her, it was wiser to withdraw first.

The other party was at the critical juncture of a breakthrough and obviously could not pursue, so Yang Kai was not overly worried.


From far behind came rumblings like muffled thunder; when he looked back he could still see strange heavenly phenomena, and Yang Kai immediately understood she was receiving the Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism—if she succeeded, she'd advance to the Dao Origin Realm.

Judging from her earlier state, it was clear she had prepared for this moment a long time; her chance of success was likely not small.

With that thought, Yang Kai set off again, walking in the opposite direction from the woman.


Over the next few days, Yang Kai gained very little. He even encountered danger, hunted for a long time by a peak Eleventh-Tier demonic beast; an Eleventh-Tier peak roughly equaled a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm warrior, far beyond Yang Kai's present strength. Had it not been for the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal guarding him and his grasp of a sliver of the spatial law, he would have been in serious trouble.

Hardly had he shaken off the pursuit and rested half a day when the surrounding space suddenly tightened; a vague heaven-and-earth force compressed in from all sides, rendering him utterly immobile.

His face changed; before he could unleash power to resist, a most mysterious formation suddenly appeared beneath his feet.


The formation spun round and round, emitting a sucking force that pinned Yang Kai to the spot; the next moment it swallowed him.

The familiar sensation of weightlessness came over him, and Yang Kai finally relaxed.


He knew this meant the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda had closed; all cultivators still alive within were being transmitted out, so he relaxed his resistance and allowed the formation's power to carry him.

Sure enough, when Yang Kai's vision returned, he had already been sent back to the plaza before the city lord's mansion.

All around, dense crowds pressed shoulder to shoulder, faces contorted in pain—clearly no one had yet recovered from the teleportation.

To avoid standing out, Yang Kai feigned discomfort and slowly regained consciousness.


Immediate murmurs rose: when Fenglin City's warriors had entered the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, some obtained great opportunities, some returned empty-handed, and some perished within.

Now that it was over, some were joyous while others mourned.

Tens of thousands had entered the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, yet only a little more than half returned alive; the rest were buried inside. The Pagoda might hold many opportunities, but it was exceedingly perilous.


The Emperor Realm figures on the high platform remained seated without moving; in the center, Xiao Yuyang's gaze flashed like lightning, and with a sweep of his eyes across the crowd he fixed upon a blue-veiled, graceful woman.

Their gazes met; she nodded lightly, and Xiao Yuyang laughed aloud in hearty amusement, clearly pleased.

“Lord Xiao seems in a good mood.” Chen Wenhao, seated to Xiao Yuyang's right, cast him a suspicious glance.

Xiao Yuyang smiled. “So-so, Brother Chen, any objections?”


“I wouldn't dare,” Chen Wenhao said, his face twitching as he quickly showed meekness. Though he was an expert of Tianwu Sacred Land and possessed First Stage Emperor Realm strength, Xiao Yuyang was the Star Envoy of the Star God Palace and his cultivation was a rank higher; Chen Wenhao dared not be presumptuous in his presence.

“Still, it's surprising that the little Fenglin City produced so many warriors who were able to emerge from the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda alive,” Feng Ming of Wuhua Hall said, his eyes scanning the crowd as if seeking good sprouts. “Lord Duan is fortunate—Fenglin City truly has many talents. Though losses were heavy this time, even if only a thousandth of those who returned advance further in the future, it would raise Fenglin City's strength by several tiers.”


“Lord Feng flatters me; it was all thanks to the aid of great lords!” Duan Yuanshan, Fenglin City's city lord, beamed broadly and spoke with extreme humility.

As Feng Ming had said, the opening of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda in Fenglin City had cost the city's cultivators greatly, but it was of value. If even a fraction of those who returned alive could advance further in the future, it would substantially boost Fenglin City's power.

In the crowd he also saw his son Duan Tianci looking radiant, clearly having gained much—how could he not be elated?

At that moment Duan Yuanshan suddenly frowned, withdrew a Transmission Compass from his bosom, poured Divine Sense into it, and his expression changed drastically.

He abruptly looked up toward Duan Tianci in the crowd; the latter nodded to him.


At the same time, more messages poured from the Transmission Compass—each reporting the same matter, all from the family heads of Fenglin City's great families.

“City Lord Duan, what has happened? Your face looks so grim,” Feng Ming asked, puzzled as he looked at Duan Yuanshan.

“Sirs, a grave matter has occurred.” Duan Yuanshan hurried forward a few steps and bowed.

Feng Ming laughed. “City Lord Duan, do not spread alarmist words. With several of us present, what could be so terrible?”

His confidence was understandable; five Emperor Realm figures were present, one even at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. Unless one of the Ten Emperors himself came to raze the city, they could handle almost any threat.

Duan Yuanshan wiped the cold sweat from his brow and said, “It is like this: Fenglin City's cultivators, on the second layer of the Pagoda, broke a seal and released an ancient Mu Xiao.”

“What?” Feng Ming's expression changed as he rose to his feet. “Is that true?”

“Absolutely true. I only just received reports from the family heads and came here without delay to report it.”

“A Mu Xiao in the Pagoda's second layer?” A young married lady, who had not yet spoken, furrowed her brows in astonishment.

That woman was Gao Xueting of Qingyang Shrine, possessing First Stage Emperor Realm strength and able to stand on equal footing with Feng Ming and the others.

“A Mu Xiao is no easy foe, and this one is an ancient Mu Xiao. Lord Xiao, why did you not inform us sooner?” Chen Wenhao complained to Xiao Yuyang.

Xiao Yuyang rolled his eyes. “The Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda is not as simple as you think. Its interior cannot be easily probed even by the Great Emperor; many seals and restrictions are deeply concealed. Even if the Great Emperor personally inspected it, he might not discover everything. This Mu Xiao that was released likely had been sealed in some hidden place.”

With his explanation, no one else had much to say.

“Please, sirs, take action and slay that Mu Xiao, or it will become a great calamity for Fenglin City,” Duan Yuanshan implored the six Emperor Realm figures.

“It's only a single Mu Xiao, City Lord Duan—what is there to fear? Besides, it has been sealed for countless years and its strength must have declined. You can kill it yourself without our aid,” Feng Ming said dismissively.

Duan Yuanshan's face turned grave. “Lord Feng, you do not know: the reports I received say this Mu Xiao can devour a cultivator's flesh-and-blood essence to quickly restore its power, and it can also spread wood seeds that hide within cultivators' bodies, later hatching to occupy their flesh and multiply into thousands. I fear some of Fenglin City's warriors have already been infected.”

“Is that so?” At this, the six Emperor Realm figures all altered their expressions.

"It's absolutely true. My son reported it—he was nearly struck down by a companion whose body had been secretly infested by a Wood Seed," Duan Yuanshan hurriedly replied.

“If that's the case, the situation is serious.” Xiao Yuyang's expression turned solemn; after a moment's thought he said, “Fine. Since the Mu Xiao came from my Star God Palace's Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, I cannot stand idly by. City Lord Duan, first activate Fenglin City's formations and close the city gates—allowing entry but not exit. Furthermore, do not let a single remaining cultivator leave; we'll shut the gates and beat the dog!”

“Yes—thank you for your aid!” Duan Yuanshan rejoiced and quickly turned, releasing his aura as he loudly commanded, “Everyone, by order of the Star Envoy, remain here a while. The lords must handle matters; once done we will allow you to go. Please cooperate.”

At his words the noisy plaza fell silent; everyone stared in astonishment at Duan Yuanshan.

Yang Kai, who had been contacting Mo Xiaoqi with an audio bead, also looked up, brow slightly furrowed, unsure what Duan Yuanshan and the Emperor Realm figures intended to do.

The renown of those Emperor Realm experts was simply too great, so although the cultivators remaining in the plaza felt displeased in their hearts, none dared show it and instead obediently stood their ground.

The six Emperor Realm figures on the platform conferred briefly; then four of them flickered and vanished, leaving only Xiao Yuyang and the young woman Gao Xueting behind.

At that moment Fenglin City hummed; a layer of dazzling energy rose into the sky like a great bowl and enveloped the entire city.
