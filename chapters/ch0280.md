## Chapter 280 — Upper-Level

As Xiao Fusheng assessed Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan sat quietly nearby, listening intently.

Elder Xiao clearly hoped that his disciple would learn something from the knowledge of alchemy, while Yang Kai was merely a backdrop in this scenario.

This assessment lasted an entire day, with Elder Xiao posing various questions about the path of alchemy, progressing from simple to complex, and from easy to difficult.

Xia Ningshang answered each question earnestly and meticulously.

Half a day later, Elder Xiao's expression turned to one of surprise, and by the end of the day, it shifted to one of astonishment, his gaze towards Xia Ningshang changing in flavor.

It was as if he had discovered a peerless treasure, his eyes gleaming with greed.

Meng Wuya chuckled to himself from the side.

Dong Qingyan looked at Xia Ningshang with admiration and awe, while Yang Kai remained composed.

After a day, Elder Xiao let out a long breath.

“How is it?” Meng Wuya glanced at Xiao Fusheng with a smug expression.

Xiao Fusheng's expression was grave, and after a long pause, he finally said, “Her foundational skills and theoretical knowledge are solid. Many of her experiences are not inferior to my own.”

During the assessment of Xia Ningshang, Elder Xiao also gained considerable insight from her various answers. This exchange was less of an assessment and more of mutual sparring; it was merely Xiao Fusheng asking questions and Xia Ningshang answering.

“Of course!” Meng Wuya replied nonchalantly.

However, the pride and smugness on his face were impossible to conceal, his lips almost stretching to his ears.

Xiao Fusheng chuckled lightly, casting a meaningful glance at him. “Theory is one thing; sometimes, no matter how good the theory is, it doesn’t translate well into practice.”

Meng Wuya immediately reacted as if someone had stepped on his tail, retorting sarcastically, “Elder Xiao, you just keep firing questions. If my disciple cannot convince you, I’ll take your surname and call you my dear father!”

Dong Qingyan couldn’t help but burst into laughter, clutching her stomach as her shoulders shook.

Xiao Fusheng also sighed with a bitter smile. He looked at Xia Ningshang and asked, “So far, what is the highest grade of Pill you have refined?”

“Lower-Level Mystery-Grade, I suppose…” Xia Ningshang replied softly.

Xiao Fusheng's body trembled, and his face immediately changed color. He looked at her in disbelief, as if trying to discern any hint of jest in her expression. Yet, her starry eyes were pure and bright, devoid of any trace of deceit.

Lower-Level Mystery-Grade…

Did this mean that at such a young age, she had already reached the level of a Lower-Level Mystery-Grade alchemist?

Qin Ze, the number one genius of Yao Wang Valley, was already thirty-five years old and had only reached Upper-Level Heaven-Grade! In terms of age, Qin Ze was nearly twice her age.

How could such a prodigy possibly exist in this world!

“What is your success rate for refining Lower-Level Mystery-Grade Pills?” Xiao Fusheng asked seriously.

“I’ve only tried once… and it was somewhat difficult,” she replied.

“Oh…” Xiao Fusheng exhaled, thinking it was somewhat reasonable. It seemed that her success was due to luck. It didn’t count as a reliable figure.

He quickly changed the subject, “What about Heaven-Grade?”

“I have never failed.”

“What!” Xiao Fusheng's face was filled with shock. “You’ve never failed?”

Xia Ningshang nodded slightly.

“Impossible!” Xiao Fusheng frowned, “Even if I personally took action, I cannot guarantee a hundred percent success rate.”

Alchemy always comes with certain risks. Although Xiao Fusheng had reached the pinnacle of alchemy, he could not completely avoid this aspect; he could only say that his failure rate was extremely low.

Meng Wuya chuckled, “There’s no such thing as impossible. If you doubt it, just try it and you’ll know.”

Xiao Fusheng's expression darkened, and after a moment, he stood up and waved to everyone, “Follow me!”

He led the way, and the others hurriedly followed.

Upon entering the room where he usually resided, they found a hidden passage leading underground, indicating that the depths of Hidden Cloud Peak were quite remarkable.

As martial artists, they floated down effortlessly, navigating several turns before suddenly arriving at a massive stone chamber.

This stone chamber was as large as several rooms combined, filled with various furnaces, and surrounded by many shelves stocked with an abundance of medicinal materials, the sheer quantity and richness astonishing.

“You have quite a collection here,” Meng Wuya remarked as he entered, examining everything with curiosity, unwilling to let go of anything he picked up.

Xiao Fusheng was unfazed, snorting lightly, “These are the fruits of my lifelong labor.”

Anyone who requested Xiao Fusheng to refine pills would always bring many heaven-and-earth treasures as compensation. Over the years, he had gradually accumulated this impressive collection.

Standing in the stone chamber, Xiao Fusheng looked at Xia Ningshang and said, “Disciple, you can use anything here. Choose the Pill you are best at refining, and let me see your skills.”

“Understood!” Xia Ningshang replied, beginning to browse through the stone chamber.

Dong Qingyan and Yang Kai quickly joined in to help. Whenever Xia Ningshang found a medicinal material, they would hold it for her.

Before long, they returned, and Xiao Fusheng inspected the materials, frowning, “These materials are all for refining Middle-Level Heaven-Grade Pills. Are you confident, Disciple?”

Xia Ningshang nodded slightly.

“Then let’s begin. Use whichever furnace you prefer; I have plenty here,” Xiao Fusheng said with a slight smile.

“No need…” Xia Ningshang replied softly.

“No need for a furnace…” Before Xiao Fusheng could finish his sentence, he saw Xia Ningshang's True Essence suddenly surge.

With a small hand, she picked up one of the medicinal materials, and her True Essence transformed into strands of crystalline silk, seeping into the material. The medicinal power quickly condensed from this herb, floating in mid-air as a drop of fragrant, crystal-clear medicinal liquid rapidly took shape.

With a flick of her finger, this drop of medicinal liquid was transferred to her other hand, suspended in her delicate palm.

Xia Ningshang then picked up another herb and repeated the process, quickly producing another drop of crystalline medicinal liquid.

The materials that had their medicinal power extracted all lost their vitality, resembling mere dead wood.

“Oh my heavens…” Dong Qingyan's eyes were filled with astonishment, her face equally shocked.

This was no longer alchemy; the various miraculous techniques were simply astonishing.

Xiao Fusheng's expression was also one of uncertainty, muttering, “The medicinal liquid can be refined like this? How is this possible? How can this be?”

In less than fifteen minutes, all the medicinal materials had been condensed into medicinal liquid, gathered in Xia Ningshang's small hand.

She waved her hands, infusing the medicinal liquids with strands of True Essence. Moments later, she suddenly clenched her hand, and the energy of heaven and earth rapidly converged. It was unclear what transformation occurred, but when she opened her hand again, a green Pill had miraculously formed.

It was perfectly round, plump, and devoid of any impurities. The surface was adorned with intricate lines, giving the entire Pill an air of spirituality and mystery.

“Pill Patterns!” Xiao Fusheng's eyes widened in shock as he suddenly exclaimed.

Yang Kai's heart stirred.

He remembered the first time he saw Xiao Fusheng; he had just finished refining a Pill. At that time, he had walked out holding that Pill, muttering something related to Pill Patterns.

“Senior, please inspect!” Xia Ningshang held up the Pill and offered it to Xiao Fusheng.

“Careful, careful, my little aunt. Don’t ruin the Pill Patterns with your nails…” Xiao Fusheng extended his trembling hands to receive the Pill, his expression reverent as if he were making a pilgrimage.

“What a disgrace!” Meng Wuya took the opportunity to tease.

“You layman, what do you know!” Xiao Fusheng scolded angrily, finally handling the Pill with great care, examining it closely.

“It really is Pill Patterns… it truly is Pill Patterns.” At this moment, Xiao Fusheng had completely lost the demeanor of a master, appearing like a country bumpkin who had suddenly entered a grand city, startled and flustered.

“Master, what are Pill Patterns?” Dong Qingyan asked softly.

“Pill Patterns…” Xiao Fusheng exhaled gently, “Pill Patterns are the highest manifestation of an alchemist's skill, the lines on a Pill, akin to the meridians within our bodies. Pill Patterns are the meridians of a Pill!”

“Pills can be divided into Mystery, Earth, and Common grades, but among Pills of the same grade, those with Pill Patterns and those without are vastly different. Pills with Pill Patterns are the result of seizing the essence of heaven and earth, and their efficacy is at least doubled compared to those without Pill Patterns! Furthermore, the existence of these Pill Patterns can also prevent the loss of a Pill's spiritual energy; no matter how many years pass, its efficacy will not diminish in the slightest!” Xiao Fusheng sighed deeply, “I have been refining Pills for many years, and in recent years, I have been studying Pill Patterns, but I could only occasionally produce a few with Pill Patterns when refining Common-Grade Pills. As for Earth-Grade, it basically never happens, and Heaven-Grade… I have never seen one.”

He then turned his gaze, looking intently at Xia Ningshang, “Disciple, what is the probability that the Heaven-Grade Pill you refine will have Pill Patterns?”

Xia Ningshang bit her lip, glancing nervously at Meng Wuya, unsure how to respond.

Master Xiao had already faced enough shocks today; she truly didn’t want to reveal the actual answer.

Meng Wuya chuckled, “Just say it.”

“About fifty to sixty percent!” 

“Gasp…” Xiao Fusheng inhaled sharply.

Fifty to sixty percent of the Pills could have Pill Patterns, and each Pill with Pill Patterns would have double the efficacy of others. Such skill…

Incredible!

His expression shifted, and Xiao Fusheng asked again, “What about Pill Clouds? Have you ever produced Pill Clouds above the Pill Patterns?”

Xia Ningshang slowly shook her head.

“Hmm, it should be due to insufficient strength. If you can reach the Divine Roaming Realm, you should be able to refine Pill Clouds,” Xiao Fusheng nodded repeatedly, trembling as he paced within the stone chamber. After a while, he suddenly said, “Everyone go outside; I have something to discuss with Meng!”

The three young people straightened their expressions and hurriedly bowed to take their leave.

Moments later, a furious shout from below echoed, “Dream on! I only have this one disciple in my life; how could I give her to you? If I had known you were such an ungrateful wolf, I should have let you die at the hands of those Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts back then!”

Xiao Fusheng replied, “That’s one thing; you can’t refine Pills, what can you teach her? Such a fine piece of jade in your hands is simply a waste. It’s only right for her to join my sect.”

Meng Wuya laughed repeatedly, “I can’t teach her, but you can?”

“I can impart everything I have learned in my life! I can help her reach the level of Upper-Level Mystery-Grade alchemist in the shortest time possible!”

Upper-Level Mystery-Grade is nothing; you underestimate my disciple too much.
