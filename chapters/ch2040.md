## Chapter 2040 — Nemesis

It was unsurprising that such a scene had unfolded: the Mu Xiao clone before them had advanced to the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm after devouring Han Leng's blood-and-flesh essence, yet the Yao Worm Matriarch was presently exerting power at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. The Azure Flame Thunder Jackal was no weakling either; though it shared the same cultivation level as the Mu Xiao clone, it could wield fire-based power, making it Mu Xiao's true nemesis.

With Yang Kai's cooperation, it would be truly strange if they still couldn't suppress the Mu Xiao clone.

One person and two Blood Beasts working together hacked the Mu Xiao's countless vines into fragments; the severed sections fell, green fluid oozing from the broken ends, and the detached vines writhed like maggots.

Yet when the green fluid drained away, the vines withered like dead wood and a gust of wind reduced them to dust.

Mu Xiao roared in rage, furiously driving its strength. Each time a vine was severed, a new one sprouted in its place; for a moment it seemed an endless tide, impossible to cut down completely.

Yang Kai's face grew stern.

He couldn't shake the feeling that this Mu Xiao clone was different—unusually tenacious and hard to deal with. Remaining on full alert, fiery sword-qi coiled around him, giving the Mu Xiao no chance to close in.

They fought for the time of a cup of tea; on the surface Yang Kai and the two Blood Beasts held the upper hand, but could not deliver a killing blow, and the battle became a stalemate.

At that moment the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal, which had been exerting fire-based power against the Mu Xiao, seemed to falter; the fireball it spat hesitated for a heartbeat.

Ssssss……

A strange sound rang out. From the earth below, a host of roots suddenly shot up and coiled around the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal.

Those were the very roots the Mu Xiao had driven into the soil earlier.

The Azure Flame Thunder Jackal whimpered and struggled fiercely, but it could not free itself from the bindings.

Seizing the moment, a vine shot forward and, with a muffled thud, drove straight into the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal's body. In the next instant the nauseating gulp that made Yang Kai's scalp tingle sounded again — the vine had begun to feast on the Jackal's blood-and-flesh essence.

The Azure Flame Thunder Jackal had originally been an Eleventh-Tier Demonic Beast with cultivation at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. After Yang Kai had slain and condensed it into a Blood Beast, its bodily essence had not been lost; nourished by the Golden Blood Threads it had in fact grown stronger.

The Mu Xiao's devouring had healed seventy to eighty percent of its previous wounds. The twisted features on the tree-trunk now showed a mixture of astonishment and joy.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's heart sank; without hesitation he moved his mind and shouted, "Return!"

At his shout, the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal, still ensnared by the roots, shuddered once—and in the next instant transformed into a strand of Golden Blood Thread, which arced leisurely back toward Yang Kai. When he drew that thread back into his body, he probed it in silence, and his expression darkened: in just that brief moment, fully one-third of the qi and blood contained within that single Golden Blood Thread had been devoured.

In other words, the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal had lost a third of its qi-and-blood power to the devouring; to replenish it Yang Kai would have to supplement it with his own Golden Blood.

On the other side, the Mu Xiao suddenly flew into a frenzy — enraged at its failure to fully consume the Jackal.

It ceased paying Yang Kai any heed and instead turned its attention toward the Yao Worm Matriarch.

Having benefited greatly from devouring the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal, it naturally intended to repeat the trick.

At the Yao Worm Matriarch's feet the earth cracked open and innumerable roots writhed like spirit snakes, attempting to coil around her.

But the Yao Worm Matriarch would not yield easily: the Purple-Green Twin Swords cast spectral twin hues, and sharp sword-qi flew like arrows in all directions. The icy Power of the Laws circled her form; the roots that struck it immediately slowed, suffering heavy damage instead of harming the Matriarch.

At the sight, Yang Kai's heart steadied.

If both Blood Beasts had been unusable in a fight like this, things would have been truly troublesome. As it stood, the Yao Worm Matriarch's performance exceeded his expectations.

After all, being a fusion of sword-intent and a Blood Beast, its combat power was simply incomparable to that of the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal.

Yang Kai was about to surge forward to join the Yao Worm Matriarch when a sudden stirring in his mind alerted him to an anxious call.

The call came, startlingly, from the sealed Liu Yan!

Although Liu Yan was sealed within the bowl, she seemed to sense the battle outside and had activated the mark Yang Kai had once left within her Divine Sense.

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, then slapped his forehead and cursed himself for his foolishness.

He had only thought of joining forces with the two Blood Beasts and had not considered Liu Yan's existence. Liu Yan was a pure fire-type Artifact Spirit; even if her current cultivation was lower than the Blood Beasts', in a battle like this she might outperform them.

As long as he freed Liu Yan first, he need not fear a mere Mu Xiao.

Thinking this, Yang Kai's gaze immediately flicked to Han Leng's corpse lodged at the Mu Xiao's left flank.

He ordered the Yao Worm Matriarch to hold; while it and the Mu Xiao continued battling, Yang Kai blurred forward to Han Leng's corpse and plunged his hand into the man's grasp to scoop up the two Spatial Rings.

Those two Spatial Rings — one belonged to Han Leng himself and the other to Ning Yuancheng — and the bowl that sealed Liu Yan had been stored inside the latter Spatial Ring.

Having seized them, Yang Kai planned to return at once.

But just then the Mu Xiao seemed to detect his furtive motion; countless vines lashed toward him, and from its body a faint streak of light flashed and vanished.

Yang Kai was shocked and hurriedly blocked the vine-strikes; after fending them off he drifted back, his expression unsettled.

He had clearly seen a thin glimmer shoot from the Mu Xiao's body, yet he could not discern where it had gone.

His Divine Sense swept over his person quickly but detected nothing amiss, which made his face grow still more troubled.

He checked once more with no result, then gritted his teeth and for the moment set the matter aside, withdrawing the bowl that had sealed Liu Yan from Ning Yuancheng's Spatial Ring.

He poured his Divine Sense into the bowl and immediately sensed Liu Yan's presence.

"Master!" Liu Yan called, "It's truly good to see you again — I always knew you would not abandon me."

Yang Kai gave a soft chuckle and said, "Of course I would not abandon you. Now is not the time for reminiscing; I'll first try to break this seal — there is a great enemy for you to deal with."

"Good!" Liu Yan answered, then fell silent.

Yang Kai drifted to a little distance and attentively examined the bowl's sealing formation.

The bowl was a special sealing Secret Treasure — not of great material value, its purpose being to incarcerate energy-forms like Liu Yan. Once sealed she could not break the formation from within, but whoever held the bowl could easily undo it from outside.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense was not something an ordinary Void King Realm could rival, so in the time of a cup of tea he had already found a clue.

He poured his Divine Sense into the bowl and peeled away the layers of sealing power.

When the seal was fully broken, Liu Yan's delighted voice rang out from within the bowl: "It's done."

With the words came a sharp cry; Liu Yan condensed into a shaft of fire and shot out of the bowl.

Whoosh — the air's temperature suddenly spiked.

Liu Yan unfurled wings, her huge body almost shadowing half the sky; her eyes burned like a blazing flame as she swept them downward and fixed on the Mu Xiao locked in combat with the Yao Worm Matriarch.

She gave a clear, piercing cry and plunged down like a meteor from the heavens.

At that moment the Mu Xiao and Yao Worm Matriarch were locked in a furious struggle. Though their cultivations differed by a Stage and the matriarch possessed icy Power of the Laws, they were only barely evenly matched; without Yang Kai's interference the matriarch could not gain the slightest advantage.

That was testament to how formidable the Mu Xiao's power truly was.

When Liu Yan wrapped herself into a ball of fire and descended in a sudden strike, the twisted features on the Mu Xiao's trunk finally betrayed a look of dread and terror — an expression it had never shown even when facing Yang Kai and the two Blood Beasts together.

Countless vines sprang from the ground and shot toward Liu Yan like spears launched with all their force, their momentum terrifying.

Liu Yan paid them no heed; she opened her maw and spewed a scarlet pillar of flame, within which purple lightning leaped and danced.

All the incoming vines turned to ash beneath that searing force. The few that were not incinerated passed through Liu Yan's form without inflicting any harm.

Liu Yan was an energy form with no tangible substance; such attacks could not wound her.

She was truly the Mu Xiao's nemesis — any of Mu Xiao's abilities were useless against her, and in properties she held the advantage.

Not only that, the lightning force Liu Yan wielded ran along those vines into Mu Xiao, causing it to convulse as if struck by a bolt of lightning.

Liu Yan's flames had mostly been refined by devouring the Sun's True Essence, and her lightning stemmed from the sentient Qiantian Thunderflame she had once consumed. In terms of ferocity, while her fire could not match Luan Feng's World-Ending Black Flame, it was still beyond ordinary fire's comparison.

How could the Mu Xiao withstand such power?

After Liu Yan's fiery form swept past the Mu Xiao, more than half of its vines had been burned away; the twisted face was now full of panic.

It no longer dared to linger. Its trunk trembled and the roots that had been buried in the earth all drew back; the short rootlets beneath its base moved as nimbly as legs, and with a swift turn it bolted away into the distance.

It actually fled at the first sign of danger.
