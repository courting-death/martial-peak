## Chapter 1733 — Now Can You Tell?

Boom...

A tremendous roar exploded; golden light scattered everywhere, and Yang Kai was flung backward, face-up, spitting a mouthful of blood in midair.

His proud blood shield, woven from a hundred Golden Blood Threads, had failed to fully block the blow, which greatly shocked him.

But that instant's clash also let him make out exactly what had attacked him.

It was a long spear—one zhang in length, the thickness of an infant's arm, its whole shaft shimmering with brilliant light, surging with extraordinary Spiritual Qi fluctuations.

A Void King-Grade Secret Treasure!

Although the Secret Treasure's actual spearbody had been stopped by the blood shield, a burst of force leaking from the spear was not fully blocked and invaded Yang Kai's body, instantly making him feel as if countless needles were piercing him; his meridians and flesh ached violently, and his face twisted sharply.

Given the attacker's cultivation and the terrifying potency of that spear, an ordinary Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator would indeed have been slain outright; but Yang Kai's foundation was profound, so he only suffered minor injuries.

Since leaving Dark Star until now, this was the first place he'd found signs of people; he had not expected to be ambushed by a Void King Realm cultivator wielding a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure.

Righteous fury burned in Yang Kai's heart; he turned his head like an enraged beast, glared viciously at that Meteorite Sea, then rapidly fled toward the distance, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

The spear that had attacked Yang Kai flew back along its original path after the strike and landed in the hand of a middle-aged man standing on a huge meteorite.

The middle-aged man's features were sullen and harsh; his build was tall and lean, and he wore a dark-blue long robe. At his feet a chilling aura spread; within a radius of ten zhang no one dared approach.

Clutching his Secret Treasure, the sullen middle-aged man showed some surprise on his face, as if he hadn't expected his blow to fail to kill Yang Kai.

"Interesting — not only did he find our hideout so quickly, he still didn't die on the spot after taking a blow from me." The sullen, sinister middle-aged man snickered coldly, glanced faintly toward the direction Yang Kai had fled, and asked, "Which one of you knows that man?"

Around him stood at least twenty Origin Returning Realm experts, each of whom was at least Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—none were First Stage. At his question they looked at one another and all shook their heads, indicating they did not know Yang Kai.

"Since none of you know him, then he is not from over there. It seems he truly was just passing through." The sullen middle-aged man pondered, "But this matter is of great importance and can't tolerate the slightest mistake; even if he's just a passerby, he cannot be released."

"My lord, after taking your blow, could he still survive?" someone nearby asked.

They had all witnessed the sullen middle-aged man's strike; no one present had confidence they could endure such a blow and survive! Though they didn't know the other's background, he was clearly only an Origin Returning Realm cultivator and thus could be no exception.

"Better safe than sorry. Zhang Fu, Liu Dong. Go and fetch his corpse for me!" the sullen middle-aged man ordered; he clearly believed Yang Kai was surely dead, that any escape was merely clinging to life.

"Yes!" The two named Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators immediately replied, activated their Star Shuttles, and pursued toward the direction Yang Kai had fled.

Thirty thousand li away from where Yang Kai had been attacked, on a meteorite, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, gazing toward the direction he'd come from, waiting quietly.

He didn't know why that Void King Realm cultivator had attacked him for no reason, but from how furtive those people were, they were clearly ambushing someone, and even if he had passed by by accident, he may have disturbed their plans.

That was why he had drawn their attack—they sought to kill and silence witnesses.

Given that, if he fled now the others certainly wouldn't let it go; pursuers would likely come.

Precisely because of that judgment, Yang Kai deliberately stopped; he did not hurry away.

Having suffered such an inexplicable loss, Yang Kai would not let it stand. Although the other's strike had been terrifying, Yang Kai had sensed the attacker was only a First Stage of the Void King Realm.

He had even slain Luo Hai before—what was there to fear from a First Stage of the Void King Realm? Although he no longer had a Star Emperor Token to use, even if he couldn't beat them, escape was still possible.

Back when Luo Hai chased Yang Kai in the Star Domain for months and months, causing him great suffering, was some unknown First Stage cultivator truly more powerful than Luo Hai?

His guess was indeed correct. After waiting for less than half a cup of tea’s time on that meteorite, two streaks of light suddenly appeared in the distance. Judging by their brightness and speed, the newcomers were both cultivators at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

A mocking smile curled at Yang Kai's lips; when they drew close enough he feigned panic, leapt hastily from the meteorite, activated a Star Shuttle, and continued to flee.

But by his deliberate acting, his escape light flickered and his speed was deliberately slow, giving the appearance of being gravely wounded and at the end of his tether.

The two warriors, Zhang Fu and Liu Dong, seeing this, exchanged a glance and couldn't help but smile; they tailed Yang Kai unhurriedly, adopting a cat-and-mouse attitude and not rushing forward to finish him.

As he fled forward, Yang Kai would occasionally look back as if fearing he would be overtaken.

This made Zhang Fu and Liu Dong even more wanton; not only did they trail him, they continually taunted him.

After two hours, estimating the distance was about right, Yang Kai suddenly stopped, turned, and stood motionless in the void.

A flash of light, and Zhang Fu and Liu Dong both appeared thirty zhang in front of Yang Kai, looking at him with mocking faces.

The taller Zhang Fu sized Yang Kai up and down, chuckling coldly: "Boy, you're something—after taking Lord Li's Soul-Breaking Spear blow you still didn't die; this Zhang must admit his admiration."

"Lord Li?" Yang Kai frowned, his face horribly sullen and as pale as snow, coughing slightly as he spoke: "I have no grudge with any of you; may I ask why Lord Li struck me from ambush?"

Zhang Fu sneered and, leisurely toying with a ring-shaped Secret Treasure in his hand, lifted his eyes and said: "We indeed have no grudge; blame your lack of sight for passing by here. Heh heh, Lord Li hates nothing more than his plans being disrupted."

"What plan?" Yang Kai asked.

Liu Dong standing beside Zhang Fu said impatiently: "You're going to die, why ask so many questions?"

"It's precisely because I'm about to die that I want to ask clearly, so I won't die without knowing why!" Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

"You want to die with clarity?" Zhang Fu sneered at Yang Kai.

"That's right!"

"It's not that we can't tell you, anyway you—" Zhang Fu said teasingly, but was cut off by Liu Dong: "Why waste so many words with him? Kill him and return to report to Lord Li—that's important!"

"True!" Zhang Fu agreed, nodding, then glanced at the Spatial Ring on Yang Kai's hand: "If this brat could take Lord Li's blow and not die, he isn't someone to be trifled with; such people usually have good things—later we'll split whatever's in his ring fifty-fifty."

"No problem!" Liu Dong nodded.

In just a few words they divided Yang Kai's belongings; after all Lord Li had only said to bring back the corpse and had not demanded the items, so these things could naturally fill their pockets. Given Lord Li's status, he would look down on such matters and would not pursue it.

"Want my things?" Yang Kai's mouth curved slightly; he said coldly, "I just fear you won't live to take them!"

"Impudent brat!" Liu Dong snorted; the next moment his face changed utterly, his eyes bulging as he stared fixedly at where Yang Kai had originally stood, but that place was already empty.

Yang Kai had somehow disappeared.

A faint chill suddenly swept his neck, and at his ear Zhang Fu's terrified cry rang out: "Brother Liu, dodge!"

Liu Dong, after all a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, sensed danger the instant he noticed Yang Kai's disappearance; at Zhang Fu's warning there was no hesitation—he spurred his Saint Yuan and tried to evade from where he stood.

But to his horror, the Saint Yuan within him was being crazily suppressed by a Shi field; its flow slowed to a crawl, and even the void around him completely solidified.

Such a powerful Shi field? Liu Dong's heart sank; he hurriedly activated his own Shi field to resist.

This was a standard tactic and process in duels between Origin Returning Realm experts; the strength of one's Shi field often decided the final victory.

But the reality drove him to despair: his Shi field had barely spread outside his body when it dissolved like a snowflake before a fierce sun, utterly unable to take form!

In that very instant, a chill swept across his neck—then his vision abruptly flipped upside down. Through his own eyes, he saw a headless corpse standing in the void, crimson blood gushing from its neck like a fountain—ghastly, yet magnificent.

The clothes, the build, and the ring on the hand... it all looked just like his.

Had I already been killed?

Liu Dong's forehead grew cold; he vaguely realized something, but soon darkness fell and swallowed all his consciousness and life.

"Now can you tell?" When Yang Kai reappeared he was three zhang in front of Zhang Fu, his face rosy, with no trace of previous injury—he was clearly as well as could be.

He stared coldly at Zhang Fu; around his finger a sentient-seeming Golden Blood Thread coiled and spun, like a spirit-serpent choosing its victim and baring its core.

Zhang Fu shuddered all over; a chill ran from his head to the soles of his feet, nearly causing his soles to cramp!

Liu Dong, who was equal to him in strength, had been beheaded at a single glance from the other.

In that instant he had only seen a thread of golden light flash at Liu Dong's neck; he hadn't even seen how Yang Kai struck.

Is there truly such a powerful Origin Returning Realm cultivator in this world?

Even if Lord Li himself had wanted to slay them, would it have been so effortless?

Zhang Fu stood there pale as death, beads of sweat the size of beans forming on his forehead and sliding down his cheeks.
