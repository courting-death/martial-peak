## Chapter 2373 — Take a Step Back and the Sea Broadens

This young man named Yang Kai must have severed his cultivation at the critical moment; otherwise there’s no way he could have remained unharmed.

To sever one’s cultivation is to cut off the path of the Martial Dao. Thinking of this, Ling Yinqin couldn’t help but sigh with regret. Judging by his complexion, he’d clearly suffered serious injuries—otherwise, why would he look so pale?

He was truly unlucky. He’d only been in the Jixu Secret Realm for a few days before disaster struck. If he’d arrived two months later, he might have had a chance to break through to the Emperor Realm in the outside world.

“Brother Yang, did you fail to break through?” Jiao Yi asked bluntly, mouth agape.

He hadn’t thought much of it—he just saw Yang Kai return so quickly, with no sign of advancement in his cultivation, so he asked.

But as soon as he spoke, Ling Yinqin quietly kicked him. Jiao Yi immediately realized his mistake and shut his mouth.

If no one else were here, it’d be fine for him to ask and show concern for Yang Kai. But with others present, his question only revealed Yang Kai’s poor condition to everyone.

“Yes, I failed,” Yang Kai replied calmly, showing no trace of frustration.

“Breakthrough?” The purple-robed man opposite raised his brows, seeming to realize something. He looked at Yang Kai and asked, “So the commotion earlier was you trying to advance?”

“Who are you?” Yang Kai glanced at him indifferently.

Ling Yinqin hurriedly sent a voice transmission: “He’s Yang Leshui, the Vice Pavilion Master of Xuanyun Pavilion. Xuanyun Pavilion is quite influential on Tongtian Island—the Pavilion Master is an Emperor Realm expert. Don’t speak, let me handle this.”

From her tone, she clearly feared Xuanyun Pavilion.

Yang Kai had chatted with Jiao Yi before and knew that Tongtian Island had many factions. To survive in this hellish place, martial artists had to band together, and over time, all sorts of groups formed. Ling Yinqin and her people were one such group, just not a famous one.

On Tongtian Island, there were three to five Emperor Realm experts, and the forces under their command were the strongest. No one dared provoke them lightly. Xuanyun Pavilion was one of these powers.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected to encounter Xuanyun Pavilion’s multi-deck ship out here on the vast sea.

Ling Yinqin’s voice transmission was clearly out of concern that Yang Kai, being new, might offend the other side without realizing it. She meant well.

Meanwhile, a man beside Yang Leshui suddenly leaned in and whispered something to him.

Yang Leshui’s eyes lit up at once. He looked at Yang Kai with a meaningful smile and said, “Kid, you and that woman are both new here, aren’t you? You look unfamiliar.”

Ling Yinqin’s heart sank. All the crew on her ship were regulars. The man beside Yang Leshui obviously recognized them, so when he saw Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun—two unfamiliar faces—he realized they must be newcomers.

Newcomer martial artists usually carry some Source Crystals. To those in the Jixu Secret Realm, that’s like two fat sheep. Even someone like Jiao Yi had been tempted before, let alone the people of Xuanyun Pavilion.

Ling Yinqin said seriously, “Brother Yang, these two are my crew, not newcomers. You must be mistaken.”

Yang Leshui’s face darkened. He snorted, “Wretched wench, are you even qualified to call me ‘Brother Yang’?”

Though his cultivation was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, about the same as Ling Yinqin's, he was the Vice Pavilion Master of Xuanyun Pavilion, backed by an Emperor Realm expert. His status was far above Ling Yinqin’s, so her casual address angered him.

Ling Yinqin’s expression darkened, yet with the situation stacked against her, she had no choice but to bow her head. “Deputy Pavilion Master Yang, this concubine misspoke just now. I ask that Deputy Pavilion Master Yang not take offense.”

She’d lived in the Jixu Secret Realm for decades and knew who not to provoke. Even if she was resentful, she could only swallow her anger for the sake of peace.

Jiao Yi and the other crew members clenched their fists in secret, grinding their teeth.

“Hmph!” Yang Leshui shot Ling Yinqin a sidelong glance. “Just this once. Next time, I won’t let it slide.”

“Thank you, Vice Pavilion Master Yang,” Ling Yinqin said through gritted teeth.

“As for these two…” Yang Leshui pointed at Liu Qianyun and Yang Kai, smiling. “Do you think I can’t tell if they’re new? People who’ve lived here for years always carry a bit of sea aura, but they don’t have any. Clearly, they just arrived. Ling Yinqin, you’ve got some nerve trying to fool me!”

Ling Yinqin’s expression changed. She knew she couldn’t deny it now. Worried, she glanced at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, wondering how to get them out of trouble, but she knew the chances were slim. Guilt filled her heart.

She’d thought Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun would panic after being targeted by Yang Leshui, but instead, the two were chatting quietly, completely unfazed. It seemed Yang Kai was asking Liu Qianyun about the marks on her face, but Liu Qianyun just kept shaking her head, leaving Yang Kai helpless.

“Hand over these two, and give me half your haul from this trip. Then I’ll let you off just this once!” Yang Leshui pointed at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, ordering arrogantly.

“Half our haul?” Jiao Yi, hot-tempered as ever, exploded. “Why don’t you just rob us?”

Yang Leshui’s face darkened. He glanced at Jiao Yi and snorted, “Ling Yinqin, is this one of yours? Do you know what happens if you offend me?”

Ling Yinqin immediately glared at Jiao Yi and hissed, “Don’t make trouble.”

With the Big Sister speaking, Jiao Yi didn’t dare say more, though his face was twisted with anger, and the others looked much the same.

They’d risked their lives at sea, finally returning with a full haul, only to be blocked by Yang Leshui and forced to hand over half their gains.

That half was no small amount—equivalent to a year or two of hard work. Who would willingly give it up?

Ling Yinqin cupped her fists. “Vice Pavilion Master Yang, since these two boarded my ship, they’re my crew. I must ensure their safety. How about this: we’ll give you all our haul from this trip, but you must promise not to trouble them.”

“You’re bargaining with me?” Yang Leshui narrowed his eyes, cold light flashing as he radiated icy intent.

Ling Yinqin raised her chin. “We collected over a hundred thousand pieces of Cangyu Coral this time, and also have the corpse of an Icefire Armored Dolphin. Vice Pavilion Master Yang, you can decide if that’s worth it.”

“What?” Yang Leshui was stunned. “Over a hundred thousand pieces of Cangyu Coral, and the corpse of an Icefire Armored Dolphin?”

Even as Vice Pavilion Master, he’d never seen such a fortune at once.

Just the Cangyu Coral alone was incredible, not to mention a Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast’s corpse! A Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast was equivalent to an Emperor Realm expert, and its Inner Core was priceless.

In the Jixu Secret Realm, many Spiritual Pills were refined from sea beast Inner Cores. The Inner Core of a Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast could be used to make Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills—its value to Yang Leshui was immeasurable.

He was instantly tempted.

But Yang Leshui still said coldly, “Ling Yinqin, are you trying to trick me? An Icefire Armored Dolphin is a Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast. How could you possibly kill it?”

Ling Yinqin replied, “It was already dead. That patch of Cangyu Coral was its territory—we just went to harvest it.”

Yang Leshui believed her immediately. In the Jixu Sea, martial artists often stumbled upon opportunities and windfalls, gaining treasures without effort.

He laughed heartily. “You’re lucky indeed. Not bad, not bad. With all this, you can buy your lives.”

Ling Yinqin said seriously, “So Vice Pavilion Master Yang agrees?”

Yang Leshui nodded. “Of course. Why wouldn’t I? I won’t take the people, but besides your earlier offer, those two must also hand over their Spatial Rings.”

He wanted Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun mainly for the Source Crystals in their Spatial Rings. As long as he got the rings, he didn’t care about their lives.

Ling Yinqin frowned. “I can’t decide that for them.”

As she spoke, she turned to look at Yang Kai, her face full of helplessness.

She’d done all she could—now it was up to Yang Kai to be sensible.

Yang Kai snorted, “To be this shameless, you really are one of a kind.”

Earlier, when Ling Yinqin and Yang Leshui were negotiating, even though Jiao Yi and the others were angry, none of them interrupted. When Ling Yinqin offered all their gains to protect Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, not one crew member objected.

This made Yang Kai realize how much authority Ling Yinqin held among them. He and Liu Qianyun had no real connection to them—just paid for passage and a room. Who would pay such a price to protect strangers?

Ling Yinqin did it because Yang Kai boarded her ship, and anyone on her ship was her responsibility.

She was a woman of principle! Her subordinates trusted her completely—no matter what she decided, they would obey.

He could see what Ling Yinqin meant. Though she didn’t say it outright, she was clearly urging him to pay up and avoid disaster.

Ling Yinqin thought he’d failed to break through and severed his cultivation, so his momentum was weak. But she didn’t know Yang Kai didn’t care about these people at all.

So when he spoke so arrogantly, Ling Yinqin’s face changed. She hurriedly said, “Yang Kai, endure for a moment and the storm will pass. Take a step back and the sea broadens!”

Yang Kai snorted, “Big Sister Ling, the martial path is about forging ahead, facing challenges head-on. Always retreating and yielding is a bad habit. Some people, if you give them an inch, they’ll shit and piss on your head.”
