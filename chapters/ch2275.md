## Chapter 2275 — Seizing

After speaking, Yang Kai closed his eyes and focused, seizing every moment to restore his strength.

Earlier, he had swallowed quite a few Spiritual Pills, and now their medicinal effects had condensed within his flesh and meridians without fully dissolving, causing blockages in his Origin Qi. He needed to resolve those medicinal effects completely, guiding them through his flesh.

The Artifact Spirit was still outside the range of the black flame, constantly hammering its own body with the warhammer, busy beyond measure.

Time passed slowly. Only after an hour did the Artifact Spirit finally manage to extinguish the remaining small flames on its body.

However, after that ordeal, the Artifact Spirit seemed to realize that this black flame was not to be trifled with. It no longer dared to charge inward, only standing outside, roaring and howling, restlessly provoking and threatening Yang Kai.

Yang Kai paid it no mind, remaining seated in meditation and regulating his strength.

Another hour passed. At one moment, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes; his demeanor was no longer weak and exhausted, but shining with vigor.

He stood up tall, grinned fiercely at the Artifact Spirit, and said, “You’re dead!”

“Roar!” the Artifact Spirit howled in fury.

But Yang Kai’s figure flickered, instantly teleporting out of the area shrouded by black flame. In the next moment, he lunged straight at the Artifact Spirit, his eyes shining like stars as he stared directly into the Artifact Spirit’s blood-red gaze.

“Look at me!” Yang Kai shouted in a low, explosive voice.

It was unclear if the Artifact Spirit could understand him, but it instinctively raised its head to look at Yang Kai.

As their gazes met, golden light flashed in Yang Kai’s left eye—the World-Ending Demon Eye had opened, and a wondrous soul-seizing power surged forth, pressing down on the Artifact Spirit.

The Artifact Spirit’s expression suddenly went blank.

In the very next instant, the phantom of a war blade suddenly emerged from Yang Kai’s eye, flickering once before hovering within the Artifact Spirit’s sea of consciousness. The blade was no more than five feet long, exquisitely wrought from tip to hilt. Dragons and phoenixes were carved along its handle, and its entire form radiated an overwhelming, formidable aura.

Soul-Severing Blade!

This was the first time Yang Kai had used it since refining this Imperial Treasure.

Since the Artifact Spirit was the manifestation of an Imperial Treasure, Yang Kai dared not be careless, so he used his strongest move right from the start.

The Soul-Severing Blade buzzed incessantly, a halo spreading from its body, countless intricate runes swirling around it.

Yang Kai shouted in a low voice, “Heaven-Shattering Strike!”

As his words fell, the Soul-Severing Blade slashed down with a thunderous roar.

“Roar!” The Artifact Spirit seemed to suffer immense pain, howling in agony. Its entire body became illusory and unstable, as if it might collapse at any moment.

After all, the Heaven-Shattering Strike was a soul secret art Yang Kai had learned from Tian Yan. During this period, whenever he had spare time, he used this secret art to temper the Soul-Severing Blade, so its first strike now was incredibly powerful.

However, because the tempering time was too short, and more importantly, because Yang Kai’s cultivation was too low and he hadn’t fully refined the Soul-Severing Blade, there was still much room for this attack’s power to grow.

But it was already enough.

With a single strike, the Artifact Spirit staggered backward, completely unable to resist. Its solidified body dimmed, on the verge of collapse.

Yet it showed no fear, becoming even more ferocious. It raised its warhammer high, poised to smash it down on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, secretly crying out in alarm. In his urgency, a snow-white lotus bud appeared in his left eye.

“Bloom, Lotus!” The bud flashed and vanished, appearing in the Artifact Spirit’s sea of consciousness. Using his soul power as the source, it slowly began to bloom.

With two great soul secret arts and the soul Imperial Treasure, Yang Kai had exhausted nearly all his trump cards, finally freezing the Artifact Spirit’s movements in place.

From his left eye, a thread of golden blood slowly trickled down.

As the lotus gradually bloomed, the light on the Artifact Spirit’s body grew dimmer, and in the blink of an eye it became transparent.

Soon, where the Artifact Spirit had been, only the phantom of the blooming lotus remained. When it fully opened, it burst apart with a bang, leaving only the warhammer behind in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gasped for breath, his face pale and bloodless. Before he could do anything, the warhammer trembled slightly, trying to escape.

“Still not dead?” Yang Kai exclaimed in surprise. This Artifact Spirit had taken two of his strongest soul secret arts and still wasn’t slain on the spot—its tenacity was truly beyond his expectations.

But that was as far as it went. Just as the warhammer was about to tear through space and escape, Yang Kai directly tossed out the Xuan Realm Pearl. He formed seals with both hands, summoned the power of Spatial Law, and a spatial rift split open before the pearl.

"Stop him!" Yang Kai shouted.

From within the rift, a giant arm shot out—it was the Incarnation’s arm. The Incarnation spread its five fingers wide, pressing down like a mountain, sealing the space so the warhammer had nowhere to flee.

Then it grasped the warhammer in its palm and withdrew it into the Small Xuan Realm.

The spatial rift gradually disappeared.

Yang Kai collapsed to the ground, feeling utterly spent. The strength he had painstakingly recovered was once again depleted, golden stars dancing before his eyes. When he tried to stand, he fell back down.

A fragrant breeze swept over, supporting his body. Yang Kai turned his head with difficulty and saw Liu Yan’s face.

“Master, are you alright?” Liu Yan asked anxiously.

Yang Kai shook his head with difficulty, then glanced around and noticed that Hua Qingsi had also arrived. He immediately understood that the two must have come earlier, simply hiding in the distance and only revealing themselves when they sensed the battle here, intending to lend a hand. However, they hadn’t expected the fight to end so quickly.

In fact, if Yang Kai hadn’t exhausted himself collecting the Source Crystal mine earlier, he wouldn’t have been entangled with the Artifact Spirit for so long.

Although the Artifact Spirit was the manifestation of an Imperial Treasure, it was restrained by soul attacks. The soul secret arts Yang Kai mastered were incomparably powerful, so as long as he recovered enough soul power, dealing with the Artifact Spirit wasn’t difficult.

“I’m fine!” Yang Kai shook his head weakly. “Where’s Ruoxi?”

Liu Yan replied, “It’s too dangerous here, so I had her follow that woman named Ye Qinghan.”

Yang Kai nodded. “That’s good! I’ll recover for a bit. Liu Yan, see if you can absorb this Luan Feng Black Flame. If you can, it’ll be greatly beneficial for your growth.”

“That’s exactly what I was thinking!” Liu Yan’s beautiful eyes flashed with intense heat as she stared at the World-Ending Black Flame covering a hundred li, as if seeing a delicious meal. She stuck out her crimson tongue and licked her lips.

Yang Kai looked at Hua Qingsi. “Sister Hua, I’ll leave the Xuan Realm Pearl to you!”

“He actually… called me Sister Hua…” It was the first time Hua Qingsi had heard Yang Kai address her like that, and she was momentarily stunned. By the time she recovered, Yang Kai had already slipped into the Small Xuan Realm, and the Xuan Realm Pearl flew toward her under residual force.

“That brat, trying to act young!” Hua Qingsi curled her lips in dissatisfaction at Yang Kai’s new way of addressing her. But her annoyance quickly faded as her attention was drawn to the Xuan Realm Pearl. She held it up before her eyes, examining it closely with great curiosity.

Although she had always stayed in the Small Xuan Realm, this was her first time seeing the true form of the Xuan Realm Pearl. She couldn’t help but be curious, wondering which great expert had such skill to refine a world into a bead.

Her dissatisfaction was quickly forgotten as she eagerly studied it.

After all, this was an Imperial Treasure. If she could glimpse even a bit of its mysteries, it would be of great help to her growth.

She secretly guessed that the reason Yang Kai was so proficient in spatial power was probably because he had comprehended the mysteries of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Actually, she was mistaken. Yang Kai had cultivated spatial power first and obtained the Xuan Realm Pearl later. It was precisely because he had cultivated spatial force that Yang Yan had entrusted the Xuan Realm Pearl to him back then. Otherwise, the Xuan Realm Pearl wouldn’t have ended up in his hands.

However, Yang Kai had indeed gained many insights into the mysteries of Spatial Law from the world principles within the Xuan Realm Pearl.

…

In the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai appeared, dazed for a moment before exclaiming, “Such dense Spiritual Qi?”

Only now did he realize that the Spiritual Qi in the Small Xuan Realm was five or six times denser than before.

A buzzing laugh rang out. “Where did you think all the Spiritual Qi you absorbed at the spirit spring went?”

Yang Kai glanced at the Incarnation and chuckled. “I just didn’t expect so much Spiritual Qi to be absorbed. Now, the cultivation environment here is probably no worse than the sacred lands of top sects.”

The Incarnation nodded. “Indeed, but… the Spiritual Qi here is like water without a source, wood without roots. If it isn’t replenished, it will eventually run out.”

Yang Kai sighed, “The laws of heaven and earth in the Small Xuan Realm are still incomplete. Though it forms a world of its own, if we want it to generate Spiritual Qi on its own, we’ll need to find a way to evolve its laws further!”

As he spoke, he looked at the Incarnation, squinting. “Why are you sitting by the Source Crystal mine?”

The Incarnation sat solemnly, forming hand seals with one hand and gripping the Demonic Warhammer with the other, sitting right next to the Source Crystal mine. “I’m cultivating the Heaven Devouring Battle Art!”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. “The Source Crystal mine here produces Middle-Level and Upper-Level Source Crystals. Use them sparingly.”

The Heaven Devouring Battle Art devours everything under the heavens. The Incarnation could even devour a cultivator’s flesh and blood essence, let alone a Source Crystal mine.

As the Heaven Devouring Battle Art operated, Spiritual Qi from the Source Crystal mine surged into the Incarnation’s body like rivers flowing into the sea, grand and magnificent.

The Incarnation said, “Don’t worry, I’ve already split the mountain in two. The other half is for you.”

Yang Kai nodded. “That’s best. If you have time, break up my half. I might need Source Crystals someday… I’ll recover for now and talk to you later.”

With that, Yang Kai flashed over to the medicine garden, sitting down cross-legged.

The Everlasting Tree stood here, brimming with vitality. Although he hadn’t suffered serious injuries, he was greatly depleted. With the Everlasting Tree’s vitality, he could recover even faster.

With a single thought, the Spiritual Qi in the Small Xuan Realm converged on Yang Kai’s location, and in an instant, the Spiritual Qi around him began to condense into liquid.

Yang Kai opened himself fully, circulating his cultivation arts, absorbing freely. His aura quickly stabilized, and his strength rapidly recovered.
