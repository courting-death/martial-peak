## Chapter 424 — Borrowing Someone

The night was deep and dense.

Inside Room One in the Zufu Inn, Dong Qinghan was seated in meditation, cultivating. The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians, two elder men, stood silently on either side, their Divine Sense hovering closely around the area, vigilant for any approaching threats that might endanger Dong Qinghan.

Tonight marked the first night of the succession war, destined to be far from peaceful. The Eight Young Masters, whether on offense or defense, would surely be making moves.

The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians were somewhat puzzled—why did Dong Qinghan appear utterly unconcerned about Yang Kai’s situation? Yet, since their young master declined to elaborate, they dared not inquire further.

Suddenly, there came a steady knocking at the door.

The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians, who had been concentrating intently, both changed their faces drastically as they turned their heads to the door, expressions struck with shock and fear.

Despite their constant surveillance, their Divine Sense had not detected the arrival of anyone outside.

If this was an enemy…

If an attack erupted at such close range, would Dong Qinghan even have a chance to survive?

Thinking this, the two twin guardians broke out in a cold sweat, hurriedly rising and quietly mobilizing their inner strength, committing themselves to heightened vigilance.

Sensing their unusual movements, Dong Qinghan opened his eyes and frowned, calling out softly, “Who’s there?”

“It’s me!” came a familiar voice from outside.

At the sound of this voice, not only did Dong Qinghan’s expression turn extremely strange, but even the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians wore peculiar looks.

“Young Master, beware of deceit!” Feng Wei whispered a warning, exchanging a glance with Yun Wei. One of them withdrew to Dong Qinghan’s side, while the other edged toward the door, opening it with wary caution.

A shadow flashed at the threshold—a figure clad in tight black clothing slipped inside. The wide hat concealed the person’s face, and the guardian only caught sight of a pair of bright eyes.

“Yang Kai?” Dong Qinghan squinted and softly queried.

Under the watchful eyes of the twin guardians, the visitor slowly lifted the hat to reveal his true face and offered a wry smile to Dong Qinghan.

Seeing him clearly, Dong Qinghan couldn’t help but curse, “Damn! So it really is you.”

Even though the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians were seasoned and powerful cultivators, they couldn’t suppress the urge to roll their eyes just now, though they managed to hold their composure.

“Greetings, venerable seniors,” Yang Kai nodded casually to Feng Wei and Yun Wei.

“Young Master Kai, respectful greetings,” the two quickly recovered from their surprise and returned the salute.

“You brat,” Dong Qinghan quickly stood and secured the window tightly. He then signaled the twin guardians to maintain their vigilance before striding over to Yang Kai with a face showing exasperated amusement. “How did you find out where I am?”

“I have a small faction devoted to intelligence gathering,” Yang Kai explained.

A small detachment of the Bamboo Segment Gang had been dispatched several days prior to this place, having already infiltrated every district of War City. That was how he was able to pinpoint Dong Qinghan’s location so precisely.

“Not bad, but don’t you know what you’re doing?” Dong Qinghan shook his head slowly as he gestured for Yang Kai to sit.

This was a succession war, not a childish game. As a direct descendant of the Yang Family, one should remain within the estate to defend and protect themselves. Yet Yang Kai had ventured out…

Yet, after a moment’s thought, Dong Qinghan felt a surge of excitement: “You’re going on the offensive?”

“That’s the idea,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Well said!” Dong Qinghan brightened. “I knew you wouldn’t act without preparation. Tell me—how many have you brought with you?”

“Just me.”

Dong Qinghan’s smile instantly froze, fading away as he stared at Yang Kai with disbelief. “I am your cousin, and you’re really going to do this alone?”

Yang Kai shook his head solemnly. “No lie. It’s really just me.”

Dong Qinghan straightened up abruptly, his plump face twitching slightly in disbelief. Even the twin guardians were stunned.

One person setting out alone, especially at such a sensitive time in the dead of night—was he mad or courting death? How could he be so foolhardy as to treat all the heroes of the realm with utter contempt?

What surprised them even more was that he actually arrived safely without being intercepted along the way—that was the most astonishing.

Yang Kai had a small intelligence faction. Surely the other Yang Family scions vying for the succession also had their own intelligence networks.

It was said that the Eight Young Masters monitored each other ceaselessly, and any slightest wind of movement would be reported immediately.

“How did you get here?” Dong Qinghan found it hard to comprehend. “And how could the two Blood Servants with you allow it?”

“They didn’t know.” Yang Kai shook his head. He had told no one when he left the estate, only informing Qiu Yimeng, or else he wouldn’t have been able to come here.

“What about your estate?” Dong Qinghan’s expression darkened, anxiety thickening. Without Yang Kai present, that place was as if a generalless army.

“No problem there. But enough of that — I’m here to borrow someone,” Yang Kai waved off Dong Qinghan’s persistent questions.

“Borrow someone?” Dong Qinghan asked, then realized and pointed at the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians, “Them?”

“Exactly. One person alone is too weak; I won’t be able to accomplish much.”

“Just adding them?” Dong Qinghan chuckled dryly. Even together, that was only three people. Good for skulking around, but surely not for stirring up chaos.

“Not necessarily, but at least there’s a chance.” Yang Kai didn’t overpromise. He still didn’t know the situation at his target location.

But tonight, just like at his own estate, things would be extremely heated.

“If you want to borrow them, fine,” Dong Qinghan said solemnly. “But I’m coming too.”

“You can’t. Your strength is too low; having you along would only be a burden,” Yang Kai refused outright.

“I…” Dong Qinghan was left speechless, flustered and red-faced.

Yang Kai chuckled and patted Dong Qinghan’s shoulder. “Cousin, no disrespect, but I can knock you down with one hand at this point. You’d better just rest.”

The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians exchanged strange looks but dared not say a word.

“I’ll come to your estate tomorrow and explain everything. Wind and Cloud seniors, I’m taking my leave first.” Yang Kai informed Dong Qinghan then stood.

“Get lost!” Dong Qinghan growled, face dark with displeasure.

Yang Kai laughed lightly, gave a wave to the twin guardians, and exited the room.

“What the hell has this brat grown into?”

After Yang Kai and the twin guardians left, Dong Qinghan slowly shook his shoulders to dissolve the numbness. That casual slap from Yang Kai earlier had almost sealed half of his meridians; it was clear that when Yang Kai said he could easily topple him with one hand, he wasn't joking.

But last time in Lingxiao Pavilion, when Dong Qinghan narrowly defeated Bai Yunfeng of the Bai Family, it was barely a victory. How had Yang Kai grown so terrifying in just a few years?

A freak! Dong Qinghan muttered, his face full of resentment.

Within War City, three black shadows streaked through the night. Despite the city's bright lights and countless overlapping Divine Senses, no one could trace these three.

Once outside the inn, the twin guardians immediately sensed a strange and powerful Divine Sense enveloping them, isolating any aura or vitality they emitted, rendering their presence utterly undetectable.

This Divine Sense was both strong and mysterious, far surpassing even the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians' own powers. It was the mark of a formidable cultivator.

Thus, the two guardians had only to carefully follow Yang Kai, completely unafraid of exposing themselves.

They exchanged looks, their expressions betraying awe. It was clear now why Yang Kai could travel alone and arrive safely here.

What they did not know was that this was Yang Kai’s own Divine Sense. They believed he had used some high-grade Divine Soul Treasure to achieve the effect, raising their respect and expectations for him.

Their young master’s cousin truly seemed capable of pulling off something significant. Wrapped in this Divine Sense, so long as they remained hidden and refrained from direct engagement, nearly no one could detect them, making them nearly invincible.

After racing for a while, Yang Kai suddenly twisted his body and darted under a nearby rooftop for cover. The twin guardians hurried after him, puzzled as to why he suddenly became so cautious.

Just as they were about to ask, Yang Kai motioned silently, and they both held their breath and concentrated their Primordial Qi.

After a moment, the sound of flapping clothes drifted from all around, followed by multiple figures rushing ahead.

The twin guardians’ faces darkened; it was now clear Yang Kai’s caution was well-founded—experts were approaching.

Such keen awareness! They were secretly impressed. Though they had not openly revealed their Divine Sense, as Divine Roaming Realm experts their martial intuition was still sharp. That Yang Kai could sense an approaching presence they did not was telling.

Yang Kai’s lips curved into a strange smile as he watched the approaching figures.

These people bore no intention of hiding; not their forms nor their identities.

Leading the group was the Yang Family’s fifth young master, Yang Kang, swaggering as if dead and gone long ago. Beside him was Tang Yuxian, his protector. Tu Feng was not present—likely left behind to guard the family token at Yang Kang’s estate.

The token’s safety was vital, so strong Blood Servants remained to guard it. Yang Kang wouldn’t leave his estate unprotected while launching attacks.

Along with Yang Kang, many powerful allies followed, their aura surging as they charged toward the northeast corner of War City—Yang Tie’s estate, the third young master and tonight’s target.

A short while after Yang Kang’s group departed, countless figures swarmed the rooftops, zooming after them toward the northeast corner.

These were spectators—idle onlookers eager to witness the Yang Family’s internal strife. A drama of this magnitude was not to be missed.

Seeing these onlookers, Yang Kai smiled faintly, signaling the twin guardians. Then, with a casual swagger, he soared into the sky, flying alongside the crowd toward the front lines.
