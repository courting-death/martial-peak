## Chapter 1939 — The Treasure-Stealing Serpent

"Your Cuiri Pavilion's main hall isn't any worse than this place; there's no need to make such a fuss, is there?" Kou said, eyes narrowed, a flash of sharp light glinting in them as he looked at the stunned Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun.

Yang Kai turned his head and said in a low voice, "I told you, we're not from Cuiri Pavilion, and this is our first time here — believe it or not, it's up to you."

Kou nodded lightly and said nothing further, standing on the deck with his hands behind his back, carrying an air of effortless grace as if he rode the wind.

When they reached the airspace above the Biyu Sect, Kou gave a small step and the tower-ship descended straight down.

Many cultivators below, having spotted the tower-ship, hurried closer; once they recognized Senior Brother Kou and his companions, they clasped their fists and greeted them.

This Senior Brother Kou seemed to enjoy considerable prestige within the Biyu Sect, so many disciples knew him.

Some people were curiously sizing up Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, wondering why Senior Brother Kou had returned with two people — Yang Kai overheard them mention Cuiri Pavilion, as if suspecting he and Liu Qianyun were spies from Cuiri Pavilion.

Yang Kai was certain there was considerable enmity between Cuiri Pavilion and the Biyu Sect.

Yang Kai was certain of that.

At the same time, he and Liu Qianyun were secretly gauging the surrounding cultivators, and what they saw made them startle.

Some seventy or eighty cultivators had gathered, and among them more than half were Void King Realm cultivators; Third Stage Void King Realm practitioners were everywhere, and there were a dozen or so who gave Yang Kai the impression of being even stronger than Yin Lesheng.

In single combat, unless he used that Dao Origin-Grade secret treasure Huangquan Nether Veil, Yang Kai was one hundred percent certain Yin Lesheng stood no chance against them.

From the intelligence Liu Qianyun had gathered earlier, Yang Kai immediately understood that those dozen or so must have already converted all their Saint Yuan into Origin Qi; they had not advanced to the Dao Origin Realm because their comprehension of the Power of the Laws was insufficient — that deficiency was the bottleneck blocking their ascension.

That bottleneck was the enormous chasm between the Dao Origin Realm and the Void King Realm, and it was the fundamental reason Kou inspired such awe.

This was the first sect Yang Kai had encountered since arriving in the Star Realm, and everything he saw overwhelmed him.

Dozens of Void King Realm cultivators assembled together — that was unimaginable in the Star Domain. In the Star Domain, Void King Realm cultivators were the very top; even First Stage Void King Realm figures were lofty and rare. Ordinary cultivators seldom saw them.

Yet here they were as common as grass in a field, everywhere one looked.

And that was only the tip of the iceberg; who knew how many disciples the Biyu Sect truly had, how many Void King Realm, Dao Origin Realm, or even Emperor Realm cultivators it contained!

Of the seventy or eighty gathered, aside from the great number of Void King Realm cultivators, there were also Origin Returning Realm and Saint King Realm practitioners, though the lower the realm, the fewer of them there were.

In the Star Realm, cultivation strength did not rise overnight; though the environment was far superior to the Star Domain, cultivators still advanced step by step from the very bottom — it was thus unsurprising to find Saint King Realm and Origin Returning Realm practitioners here.

While Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun were inwardly shocked, Kou pointed at a cultivator who had been trailing them and said, "Cui Jing, take these two to the Bone Prison; I'll go report to Protector Bian and see how to deal with them."

"Send them to the Bone Prison?" Cui Jing looked startled; he seemed surprised by Kou's treatment of Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun, but he asked no questions and nodded, "Yes!"

As he spoke, he beckoned to Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun with a hand and said coldly, "Get down, then — how long do you plan to stay on the tower-ship?"

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun sighed helplessly and could only jump down from the tower-ship.

"Come with me!" Cui Jing said, then led the way.

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun followed with their heads down.

Both knew there was no point in explaining; since Kou hadn't trusted them from the start, he certainly wouldn't believe them now — for the moment they would have to accept their fate.

Fortunately, though their strength had been restrained, they had not been harmed.

They proceeded along a path that seemed to head toward the foot of a mountain.

Halfway there, Yang Kai tentatively asked, "Friend, may I ask — what sort of place is this Bone Prison?"

Cui Jing turned his head, sneered at Yang Kai, and snorted, "Who are you calling a friend?"

Yang Kai frowned, cupped his fist and said, "I must have offended you. May I ask, Senior Brother, if you could explain to the two of us exactly what this Bone Prison is?"

Yang Kai's attitude pleased Cui Jing, who adopted a feigned air of kindness and said lightly, "You can tell from the name — it's a place for holding people. Heh heh heh... you'll find out when you get there."

A string of low, sinister laughter made Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun's expressions change; they instinctively felt the Bone Prison could not be a pleasant place.

The Bone Prison lay beneath a mountain, guarded by Biyu Sect disciples; after Cui Jing handed Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun over to the disciples on duty, he left immediately without so much as another glance.

The disciple on duty was a Third Stage Void King Realm cultivator, his aura vast and deep as an abyss, and he looked extremely dangerous.

Only after Cui Jing had gone did he cast a sidelong glance, sizing Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun up and down, and spat, "Damn it — Cui Jing and his lot always come back from a capture and grab the Spatial Rings, leaving me with nothing at all."

Muttering to himself for a moment, he then turned to Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun and said, "Don't play games. Hand over what you have left."

"What things?" Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun asked in astonishment.

"The secret treasures you're preserving in your bodies — don't tell me Cui Jing and his lot already took even those," the Biyu Sect disciple sneered.

At that, Liu Qianyun's fair face paled slightly and Yang Kai's expression likewise hardened.

Cultivators could refine secret treasures within their bodies and draw them forth when needed; that was common knowledge. Previously, Kou and the others only asked Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun to hand over their Spatial Rings; they had not tried to seize their in-body refined secret treasures, so their action had not been utterly merciless.

But now, at the Bone Prison, the guards demanded cultivators surrender the secret treasures refined inside their bodies — naturally the two of them could not be pleased.

A treasure refined inside a cultivator's body was obviously the finest and most frequently used secret treasure that cultivator possessed, one intimately connected to the spirit; if it were destroyed or taken, the spirit would surely be harmed!

Compared with Kou and the others' earlier conduct, Yang Kai suddenly felt they had been almost merciful.

Yang Kai had only three secret treasures refined inside his body.

The Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade, the Extinction Thunder Bead, and the Xuan Realm Pearl — other than these three, he had not refined anything within his body, and he would never hand any of them over.

Although he didn't know what Liu Qianyun's refined secret treasure was, it was plain she wouldn't yield so easily.

But he seemed to have expected that. Seeing Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun remain silent, he curled his lips and sneered, "Want me to get rough? If this woman refuses to hand it over, that's fine — I, Yan Xiuran, am not someone who doesn't know how to cherish a beauty. Heh heh heh..."

His words trailed off into a lewd laugh.

Liu Qianyun, well aware of his filthy intentions, subtly moved behind Yang Kai.

The guard's expression turned cold as he narrowed his eyes and said to Yang Kai, "The woman may refuse, but you won't be allowed to."

"I have no secret treasures refined in my body," Yang Kai said in a deep voice.

The guard snorted disdainfully, "Save your lies for ghosts. Since you're so stubborn, don't blame me for being ruthless."

As he spoke, he suddenly tore a small pouch that had hung at his waist.

The pouch looked delicate and exquisite; its contents bulged and writhed like something alive.

The guard sneered as he opened the pouch and poured something out.

Upon seeing it, Liu Qianyun could not help but cry out, her pretty face going ashen.

It was a small snake — but not an ordinary one; it was a pure, snow-white snake, flawless and lustrous as carved jade.

With Yang Kai's experience he could not identify the species or purpose of such a little snake-shaped beast, but the guard producing such a demonic beast at this moment clearly had something to do with seizing cultivators' life-bound secret treasures.

The guard evidently treated the white spirit-snake with great care as he took it out.

In an instant he shot his hand out, snatching Yang Kai and hauling him up before him with a feral grin, sneering, "You refuse the toasting cup so you must drink the punishment one — don't go crying out when it starts to hurt."

With that, he gave the creature a slight shake and the white spirit-snake shot forward like an arrow, embedding itself in the skin on the back of Yang Kai's hand.

A strange scene unfolded: the white spirit-snake bit Yang Kai's flesh and as if turning to smoke slipped into his body, threading through his meridians and flesh.

Instantly Yang Kai's body convulsed violently; an unbearable pain ripped through his muscles and meridians, and his face flushed crimson.

Were it not for a powerful will, Yang Kai would have howled in agony.

"Brother Yang!" Liu Qianyun cried out in alarm, fearing Yang Kai had encountered some disaster.

A low roar issued from Yang Kai's throat, like a wounded beast; his bloodshot eyes fixed on the guard.

The guard laughed without fear, "Don't worry, you won't die. My Treasure-Stealing Serpent has no other tricks — it only takes the secret treasures refined inside others' bodies. Once it takes them, you'll naturally recover."

Sure enough...

Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart; the creature's purpose matched his earlier suspicions exactly — it was a bizarre being capable of arbitrarily seizing others' secret treasures, and in an instant his spirit sank to the bottom.
