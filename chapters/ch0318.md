## Chapter 318 — I’m Not Happy, Others Shouldn't Be Either

At this point, Yang Kai had come to understand. It seemed that Le Yu harbored some feelings for Biluo, which led him to feel uneasy upon seeing her together with Yang Kai. Biluo must also have been aware of the nuances in the situation, so she brought him here, hoping that Le Yu would teach him a lesson.

But for some reason, she felt regret.

With such thoughts, he glanced indifferently at Biluo.

Feeling the cold indifference in his gaze, Biluo's heart skipped a beat.

"This young master wishes to purchase pills, please go ahead! Our Letian Pharmacy is the largest in Piaoxiang City, you will not be disappointed, hehe!" The young man in tight-fitting clothing grinned at Yang Kai.

At this stage, if he were to walk away now, he would only be looked down upon. Moreover, the other party had clearly made an effort to invite him over, so leaving wasn’t an option.

"I'll settle the score with you later!" Yang Kai snorted coldly and stepped into Letian Pharmacy.

Biluo's face was filled with worry as she hurried after him, her captivating features marred by frustration.

As the group entered Letian Pharmacy, Yang Kai barely stood firm when he felt a pair of sharp and hostile gazes directed at him.

Following that gaze, Yang Kai's expression turned stern.

He had never seen a man so burly, towering like an iron tower, at least two heads taller than the average person. Every muscle on him seemed to bristle with explosive strength; he was broad-shouldered and hulking, resembling a deity standing there.

His small, narrow eyes squinted into slits, radiating a chilling light, with a sinister smile curling at the corners of his mouth.

Rival! Although he hadn't yet clashed with this giant, Yang Kai could still sense a faint pressure emanating from him. This Le Yu's fighting strength was likely no less than Qiu Yimeng's and might even surpass hers.

"What do you want, Le Yu?" Biluo took the initiative, trying to establish dominance as she scolded, "He is an esteemed guest of the master; do not be too presumptuous."

"Esteemed guest of the master?" Le Yu slightly paused, then sneered coldly, his eyes frosty like a glacier, "Just him? What is he? How could he be the master's guest?"

He clearly thought Biluo was trying to intimidate him and did not take her seriously.

"I speak the truth." Biluo urged, "If anything happens to him, you will be in trouble as well. The master’s wrath is not to be trifled with; even the Le family cannot protect you."

"Enough!" Le Yu's face showed clear impatience; Biluo's defense of Yang Kai only made him more dissatisfied, sneering, "Even if he is an esteemed guest of the master, so what? As long as he doesn't die, that’s fine. Besides, look at him, with such thin arms and legs. I wouldn’t even bother using my hands; I wouldn’t want others to say I'm bullying someone weaker."

Upon hearing this, Biluo couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief: "At least you still have some self-awareness!"

As long as Le Yu refrained from making a move, they wouldn’t escalate to killings.

While the two talked, Yang Kai merely stood by watching, raising an eyebrow as he said lightly, "You two settle your own grievances. I said earlier, I only came here to buy pills."

"Buying pills?" Le Yu chuckled sinisterly, "I have plenty of pills here, and when others come to buy, they pay in full, at a fair price. But for you, kid, it won’t be that easy."

"Le Yu, must you do this?" Biluo's expression cooled down as well, "Isn’t Letian Pharmacy open for business? Why make things difficult for him?"

"What if I want to make things difficult?" Le Yu’s face was filled with disdain, "Here, you either compete with me in wealth or in family background. He has nothing to offer, so he can only compete with me in strength. I can’t stand arrogant and rude people like him."

The group of young men in tight clothing sneered, swaying their heads as they slowly approached to encircle Yang Kai.

The several men were not lacking in strength; at least they were martial artists at the True Yuan Realm Third or Fourth Stage, with one being at the True Yuan Realm Sixth Stage.

Inside Letian Pharmacy, several older men squinted as they watched the situation outside, their expressions indifferent. Although they were experts of the Divine Roaming Realm, they wouldn’t interfere in the conflicts among the younger generation.

For one, Le Yu’s arrogance wouldn’t allow them to do so, and secondly, Yang Kai and Biluo arrived together, clearly indicating a different kind of relationship. If they were to provoke other Divine Roaming experts in the city—even the likes of Shan Qingluo—the situation would only become more troublesome.

No matter how the youngsters fought, it was all grounded in camaraderie and didn’t reach a higher level.

So, they turned a blind eye to the unfolding situation. Their young master bullying others wasn’t a rare occurrence; deaths from brawls were commonplace—nothing to be alarmed about.

"Kid, if you regret it now, it's not too late. I’ll allow you to choose again!" Le Yu laughed wildly.

Before his laughter could fade, Yang Kai was already in motion.

A young man from the True Yuan Realm Third Stage suddenly felt a flash before his eyes. In an instant, he was sent flying back, pain exploding in his chest before he lost consciousness.

Boom, boom, boom...

A series of dull thuds echoed as three or four figures flew into the air. Accompanied by grunts of pain and the sound of bones cracking, in the blink of an eye, Le Yu’s henchmen had collapsed to the ground, leaving only the True Yuan Realm Sixth Stage martial artist standing.

He hadn’t even realized what happened before witnessing his companions flying off, with a figure like a gale rushing towards him.

In a panic, he raised his hands to defend, but the opponent shattered his defenses as if they were nothing, and before he could react, he was completely overpowered.

Countless shadows of fists surged forth, each one ethereal and illusory, bombarding his entire body.

Crack, crack, crack...

He couldn't muster any True Yuan, and every inch of him resounded with the sound of bones breaking.

In the explosive clash, Yang Kai soared up and kicked the opponent solidly on the shoulder, sending him flying over ten zhang before he landed on the ground, motionless.

Le Yu’s pupils constricted sharply. The moment Yang Kai moved, he sensed his terrifying strength. That sudden burst of True Yuan's intensity and purity left him almost in disbelief. In a daze, he realized all his subordinates had been vanquished.

"Ugh..."

Biluo blinked her large eyes, staring at Yang Kai in shock.

Although she had interacted with Yang Kai several times, she didn’t know him well. Her understanding of him was merely that he didn’t seem to be very high in cultivation.

This was the first time she had witnessed him in action.

In a flash, four or five martial artists at the True Yuan Realm were defeated. What tremendous combat power was this?

Could a True Yuan Realm Fifth Stage martial artist achieve such strength? Biluo’s heart trembled.

Suddenly, she understood why the master placed such importance on him.

This True Yuan Realm Fifth Stage seemed a bit extraordinary!

Inside Letian Pharmacy, the older men’s eyes also narrowed in astonishment.

Yang Kai’s strikes were decisive and ruthless; each of the True Yuan Realm young men had at least ten broken bones, and the one at the True Yuan Realm Sixth Stage was in even worse shape. He would likely be bedridden for half a year.

How come such a domineering and formidable young man had never been heard of before?

In the center of it all, Yang Kai stood there with an indifferent expression, casting a casual glance at Le Yu before speaking, "Biluo!"

"Yes?" Biluo was startled and quickly responded.

"Take the pills and let’s go."

"Oh!" Biluo hurriedly ran out, clutching the several bottles of pills the attendant had brought, and walked toward Yang Kai with a worried expression.

"Trying to leave?" Le Yu roared angrily, like a thunderclap that shook the entire street, charging in front of Yang Kai and blocking his path with an unfriendly expression, "You think you can just walk away after injuring my people? It’s not that easy!"

"What do you want?" Yang Kai looked at him coldly.

"Let us have a match!" Le Yu cracked his neck, the sound like a series of crunches, an ominous look on his face, "If you win against me, then you can leave!"

"Le Yu, don’t go too far!" Biluo glared at him.

"I’ve already gotten what I wanted. Do you think you still have any capital to make me fight?" Yang Kai scoffed at him.

Le Yu smirked: "You want the pill that supplements your Divine Sense? There is also a Divine Pill in the pharmacy, a Mystery-Grade Lower-Level pill! How about it?"

"Not interested!"

A Mystery-Grade Lower-Level pill was indeed a high-grade item, but with only one available, it failed to motivate Yang Kai. No matter how good the pills were, they would simply be consumed and gone.
