## Chapter 1100 — A Place to Settle

Dark Star differs greatly from other cultivation stars in one respect: the gravity pulling toward its core is immense.

Yang Kai had noticed before that the larger a cultivation star's mass, the stronger its gravitational pull seemed to be, as if a proportional relationship existed; the core gravity of Dark Star, however, was especially fierce, incomparable to the other cultivation stars.

Cultivating in such an environment offered benefits far greater than those on other cultivation stars.

Moreover, the Spiritual Qi here was not as thin as one might imagine; compared with Rainfall Star or Shuiyue Star it was slightly inferior, but coming from the Tongxuan Continent, this place was virtually a paradise.

He was very satisfied with it.

After roaming the Star Domain for several years, he felt he should find a place to stay for a while and cultivate properly; only with sufficient strength could he truly have the power to do what he wanted.

In the vast Star Domain, finding Su Yan would be like looking for a needle in the sea.

But he had seen a feasible method from the path he had trodden in the past.

That was to make his name known, to let the whole Star Domain know of his existence; then, no matter where Su Yan might be, she would surely come searching for him on her own, and he wouldn't need to run about frantically looking for her.

Back on the Tongxuan Continent, it was precisely because the Hu Family sisters, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er, had heard his name that they were able to find the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and ask him for help.

This process might be very long, but compared to him running about like a headless fly, it was far more practical; Yang Kai was prepared to spend decades, even a century, to achieve this wish.

He did not care about time, for however long it took, it would not erase the feelings between him and Su Yan.

Little Senior Sister was the same — once he was strong enough he could return to the Tongxuan Continent and bring them into the Star Domain.

Dark Star would be the stop where he decided to remain for a while.

While wandering around the Haike Family’s manor, feeling bored and considering whether to go see Tianyun City, a streak of light from a Star Shuttle suddenly rose within the estate and shot outwards at great speed.

Yang Kai clearly saw the figure of Wu Yi standing on the Star Shuttle.

After some thought, Yang Kai guided his own Star Shuttle to follow, trailing several li behind Wu Yi.

Yang Kai didn't know what had happened to her, but she looked wronged. He could still hear her faint sobs as she flew aimlessly for a time before landing on a desolate mountain. Sitting alone on the ridge in a green dress, she hugged her knees and buried her head.

Yang Kai landed beside her, not knowing how to comfort her, so he simply stood there and waited for her to regain herself.

The delicate shoulders of Wu Yi trembled. As if sensing someone approaching, she lifted her head, glanced once, and upon recognizing Yang Kai, refused to pay him any mind and instead cried even louder.

Yang Kai scratched his head in exasperation.

After a long while, her crying gradually subsided; she wiped her eyes with both hands and, squinting at Yang Kai, said, "Don't tell others!"

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

"It's so unfair," Wu Yi said through her sobs, "so many people died just to collect those ores, and the family simply—one word—and handed them over to that bastard Xie Hongwen, without even a decent reward!"

"Small families have their sorrows; this sort of thing has happened more than once, hasn't it?"

"Why do those strong people always enjoy bullying the weak? Is there no fairness in this world? If I were in a high position, I would never act like that," Wu Yi cried out indignantly, as if venting the anger in her heart. "Don't they know this will chill people's hearts? Once the people’s hearts are lost, the family will be lost as well! How can they be so shortsighted—groveling and clinging to life in humiliation?"

"When you truly stand in that position, perhaps you'll understand that helplessness."

"Which side are you on?" Wu Yi glared at Yang Kai with malice, annoyed that he would not speak up for her.

Yang Kai hastily raised his hands: "Alright, alright, say it — I'll shut up and listen."

Feeling encouraged, Wu Yi's red lips fluttered as she poured out all the grievances and injustices she had suffered over the years without caring whether Yang Kai wanted to hear them. The family's cowardice saddened her, the domineering of Yingyue Hall left her helpless, and her own weakness made her sorrowful; she had borne much pressure and torment.

After rambling for quite a while, Wu Yi's emotions eased considerably, though her eyes were swollen like peaches.

She suddenly shifted topics and asked Yang Kai, "Was that golden spear made by you?"

Yang Kai shook his head decisively.

The woman remained somewhat suspicious, for she knew her own followers inside and out; the only one she didn't understand was Yang Kai, whom she had picked up along the way.

"It really wasn't you?" Wu Yi seemed unconvinced. "Why do I always feel you're not as weak as you appear?"

One had to admit, her intuition was frightening. Yang Kai smiled and said, "I'm only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; even if I have some hidden means, how strong could I possibly be?"

Wu Yi stared at him in a daze and slowly shook her head. "I don't know, but I feel you're not someone to be trifled with. If I fought you, I might be the one to lose — that's a feeling I trust."

"You flatter me too much," Yang Kai denied, steering the topic away. "By the way, I'm going to take my leave."

"Leave?" Wu Yi was startled. "Where will you go? Do you know anyone on Dark Star?"

"No, but don't try to recruit me; I won't join your family."

Wu Yi smiled. "Our little family is probably beneath you. Although your realm is not high, you are still from outside and have seen greater storms. Well then, don't take my offering as recruitment; but don't forget the agreement between us."

"Of course I haven't forgotten."

"Then don't go." Wu Yi rose gracefully, stretched exaggeratedly and emitted a soft, catlike murmur. Her shapely figure was plain to see; she didn't mind Yang Kai's odd look and stamped her foot: "How about I give you this desolate mountain?"

"Give it to me?" Yang Kai was astonished.

"This Dragon Lair Mountain is my property, spanning a thousand li. Though it has no heaven-and-earth treasure or rare ores, the Spiritual Qi here is not inferior to other places. I often come here to seclude and cultivate; the scenery is nice, and Yu Feng and the others come by often. You have nowhere else to go, so stay here. From now on, if you wish, this will be your territory."

Yang Kai frowned as he looked at her, finding she was not joking. He was surprised: "Such a large area — you simply give it away?"

Wu Yi laughed teasingly. "You don't understand. On Dark Star such land is worth nothing. Dark Star is so vast that even if our Haike Family is small, we still have tens of thousands of li of territory; a mere hilltop is nothing. You probably haven’t encountered such a situation on other Cultivation Stars, have you?”

Yang Kai nodded, now realizing that land like this was indeed worthless on Dark Star.

"Why are you so keen to keep me? Have you taken a fancy to me?" Yang Kai asked warily.

Wu Yi looked at him and suddenly smiled with flirtatious charm.

Yang Kai's face darkened. "What's so funny?"

Wu Yi waved her hand. "I know you have many women; they all fancy you, but don't be so full of yourself. I only think of revitalizing my family and haven't considered romance; even if I did, I wouldn't choose someone who has many women."

"That's good," Yang Kai snorted displeased.

"Is it settled?" Wu Yi asked with a smile.

"I'll stay here for now; I have nowhere else to go anyway," Yang Kai shrugged.

"This place is actually quite good. Look — fifty li from here is Tianyun City, convenient if you need to buy anything. Oh, right, you seem to have nothing now; in a few days I'll have Yu Feng send you some things and help set up your dwelling so you can live comfortably. Don't overthink it — treat this as a temporary resting place. When the day comes that I take control of the family, I'll summon you; don't you dare refuse!"

Yang Kai sneered, unconvinced; he thought it would take Wu Yi at least decades before she could take control of the Haike Family.

Wu Yi led him through the hills and soon arrived at a secluded cave, where traces of seated cultivation remained; she explained that it was her handiwork.

The cave seemed deep and branched, carving straight into the belly of the mountain. Inside a clear spring gathered into a pool, bottom visible and waters sweet.

"The conditions are a bit harsh; you'll have to make do. Well, if you prefer, you can go live at my manor — Yu Feng and the others are there."

"No need; this is fine." Yang Kai shook his head. A mere foothold would do; the manor might be lively, but its Spiritual Qi couldn't compare, and he was satisfied with this place.

"Then get familiar with it; I must go. I still haven't distributed the rewards I promised them." With that, Wu Yi left.

After Wu Yi departed, Yang Kai took a careful look at his lodging.

Though a spring gathered inside, the cave wasn't damp and was quite livable. It was naturally formed and twisted with many turns, and there was no proper stone chamber.

He spread his Divine Sense and the situation within a thousand li was immediately revealed; as Wu Yi had said, there were no Spiritual Herbs or Spiritual Medicines of note, and no notable mineral veins. Apart from decent Spiritual Qi, it was just a desolate mountain wilderness.

No wonder she gave it so easily and felt no pangs of pity.

Yang Kai knew why she wanted to keep him: because he came from the outside and knew the world beyond. That was what Wu Yi valued most; his strength perhaps had yet to impress her.

Wu Yi had an ambitious goal of revitalizing her family; Yang Kai had his own grand aspiration to spread his name throughout the Star Domain. Though their aims differed, both required long years of struggle.

He suddenly thought this might be a good springboard: through the Haike Family, through Yingyue Hall, through Dark Star his name could spread across the Star Domain, and then he would not fear that Su Yan could not hear his name or fail to find him.

At that thought, Yang Kai was filled with hope for the future.
