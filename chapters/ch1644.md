## Chapter 1644 — Framed

The matter happened so suddenly that nobody had any time to react.

Not until Bing Die was blasted away and remained airborne for three breaths did some Enforcement Hall disciples come to their senses, roaring, "Who goes there!"

They all turned to look at Yang Kai, and when they saw the face of the one who had struck, expressions of disbelief crossed their features.

"A man?"

"Since when did Icebound Island allow men to enter?"

"Where did this fellow pop up from? He actually forced Senior Sister Bing Die back with a single strike, and even wounded her a bit."

"Huh, isn't this the person we were ordered to search for not long ago? So they've already found him — no wonder the elders told us to withdraw."

...

A group of Ice Heart Valley's female disciples stared at Yang Kai as if they had seen something bizarre, their expressions strange; when they realized this was the very person their Senior Sisters had spent a year searching for, they immediately grew excited.

They had spent a year fighting and trudging about to track Yang Kai's trace; now that they finally saw the man himself, many naturally wanted to know what was so special about him that Ice Heart Valley had devoted so much manpower and resources to the search.

No matter how they looked, they could see no clue — only that Yang Kai seemed visibly irritated, his face as cold as ice, standing alone before Qing Ya like a towering mountain, shielding her from all storms.

This scene had Ice Heart Valley's disciples frowning and guessing at what sort of relationship might exist between Yang Kai and Qing Ya.

The imagined indignity failed to arrive; instead Bing Die gave a muffled groan, and Qing Ya opened her eyes suspiciously, immediately spotting Yang Kai's figure.

"What are you doing here?" Qing Ya asked in astonishment.

"I actually came to talk to you, but I didn't expect to run into this!" Yang Kai turned back, cast a concerned glance at her and asked, "Are you all right?"

Qing Ya shook her head and forced a bitter smile, "It's nothing serious."

"Who wounded you?"

Qing Ya bit her red lip and did not answer.

Yang Kai sighed lightly, took a jade vial from his Spatial Ring and handed it over. "Take this to heal your wounds."

Qing Ya reached out to accept it and thanked him, but she did not take it immediately; instead she looked with a complicated expression toward Bing Die not far away.

Though Bing Die looked utterly miserable after taking Yang Kai's furious palm, her injuries were not severe; with Yang Kai's current strength, that strike could have taken her life outright.

After all, this was Ice Heart Valley, Su Yan's sect; Yang Kai did not want to make the matter any bigger than necessary.

Hearing Yang Kai and Qing Ya speak, a feral look crept across Bing Die's cold face. She wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and sneered, "Heal her? She won't have that chance! Openly defying the elders' orders, wounding Enforcement Hall disciples and an outer island disciple, Qing Ya — today you die!"

Qing Ya's slight body trembled; her fists clenched until her knuckles blanched.

Yang Kai abruptly turned his head, his gaze cutting toward Bing Die like an icy blade, radiating a ruthless chill.

"I was the one who wounded you. If you have grievances, take them out on me — what crime has Qing Ya committed?"

"You won't escape either. No matter who you are, if you dare run wild on Icebound Island, you won't leave in peace. As for Qing Ya... she's dead for sure — colluding with an outsider, and a man at that! Tarnishing Ice Heart Valley's reputation, sullying the sect. You two — male thief and wanton woman — what are you after penetrating my Ice Heart Valley?"

Qing Ya swayed, her face pale as she stared at Bing Die, trembling as she said, "Senior Sister Bing Die, how can you speak like that? There is nothing between Yang Kai and me. I have never done anything to disgrace Ice Heart Valley or sully the sect! Yang Kai being here is entirely because..."

"Shut up! You have no place to speak here!" Bing Die snapped at Qing Ya, teeth bared, not giving her a chance to explain. She sneered, "You call him so affectionately — and yet you dare say there's nothing between you?"

At this, many of the onlooking Ice Heart Valley disciples showed odd expressions.

Although Yang Kai and Qing Ya exchanged only a few words, anyone could tell from their demeanors and tones that their relationship ran deep — at least they were not strangers.

Could there truly be some secret between them?

Qing Ya looked mournful. "Senior Sister, you may beat me, kill me, but you must never insult me. Since joining the valley, Qing Ya has never done anything to betray the sect."

Moreover, this matter concerned Yang Kai. Yang Kai was Su Yan's man; no matter how confused Qing Ya might be, she could not possibly have any relationship with Yang Kai.

"Not done?" Bing Die glared at her with venom, "Instigating this man to ambush me — does that not count as betraying the sect?"

"I didn't!" Qing Ya cried out.

"Still daring to argue!" Bing Die barked. "If you hadn't incited him, how would he have shown up at such a crucial moment?"

Qing Ya opened her mouth, but found herself without words.

"Where there's a will to charge, one can find an accusation!" Yang Kai's face suddenly took on a trace of disappointment. "Qing Ya, if this place cannot accept you, then don't stay."

After speaking, he let out a long sigh, as if murmuring to himself, “I once thought Su Yan would be well cared for here, but now it seems it’s time to take her away. A filthy place like this will only tarnish her pure soul.”

Su Yan?

This man actually knows Su Yan?

And what did he just say... that he intends to take Su Yan away?

Has he lost his senses?

Men truly are unreasonable creatures!

Many of the women looked at Yang Kai with strange eyes, thinking this fellow must be another pitiful wretch ensnared by Su Yan's charm.

Since Su Yan joined the sect, she had not gone out often, but her reputation had spread across Chi Lan Star; even someone like Wei Feng, the Sect Master's son in the Fire Radiance Sect, could not forget her, let alone others.

Over the years countless powerful forces have come to Ice Heart Valley hoping their promising youths might win Su Yan's hand. Among them were genuine talents and rising stars, yet without exception they were rejected by Ice Heart Valley.

Su Yan is the valley's hope for the future — how could she be married off outside?

Rumor had it even the Grand Elder favored her; during her seclusion she would occasionally summon her to impart cultivation insights.

This was the greatest of honors — in the whole Ice Heart Valley only the Valley Lord and Great Elders had the standing to be received by the Grand Elder. No other elder qualified.

Su Yan was like a phoenix perched on a branch; every man on Chi Lan Star was but a crawling insect before her.

No one was worthy of her!

Yang Kai's brazen words gave the Ice Heart Valley women the wrong idea — they assumed he must be like Wei Feng and the others, hopelessly enamored of Su Yan yet forever unable to win her heart, forced to pine in secret.

"You think you can take Su Yan?" Bing Die's eyes flared with anger as she snapped, "You'll live to see the end of today before you say that! Disciples, obey my order — kill Qing Ya and this shameless man, restore the sect's dignity and make an example of them!"

As Bing Die's voice fell, several disciples who had followed her surged forward recklessly toward Yang Kai.

They had seen Yang Kai's methods against Bing Die before, but Enforcement Hall's orders were absolute: even knowing they stood no chance, they steeled themselves and charged.

The outer island disciples watching also frowned; many remained bystanders, while some, out of respect for the Enforcement Hall's authority, secretly stirred their Saint Yuan and fixed their gaze on Yang Kai.

They did not wish to strike Qing Ya, but attacking this strange man Yang Kai posed no problem.

Saint Yuan of the ice element surged about, making the already frigid Ice Peak even colder; throughout the world there seemed to be nothing but biting cold capable of freezing the ancient earth.

Those Enforcement Hall disciples who charged suddenly cried out in agony at about five zhang from Yang Kai, flipping and flying backward; they crashed into the snow pale-faced and could not get up no matter how hard they tried.

The outer island disciples who had moved against Yang Kai also trembled, their faces paling as they stared at him in shock, no longer daring act rashly.

No one had seen exactly how Yang Kai had struck, but the result made them painfully aware of the vast gulf separating them from him.

"Yang Kai, don't go too far!" Qing Ya cried out in alarm.

She had never imagined Yang Kai would dare fight Ice Heart Valley's disciples on Icebound Island.

Previously his actions had been justified by rescuing her, but now he had struck again.

Though he had not killed anyone, the state of those Enforcement Hall disciples showed their wounds were severe.

She did not care for the life or death of those fellows; after this incident Qing Ya's sense of belonging to Ice Heart Valley had evaporated.

She only wanted to leave as soon as possible.

She feared Yang Kai would go too far and force Ice Heart Valley's experts to intervene!

By then, no matter how powerful Yang Kai might be, he would not easily escape.

Bing Die still stood where she was watching the scene with a sudden smile that was like a snake baring its fangs, an expression of triumph on her face: "Fine, fine! Whoever it is this time, don't think you'll save her — you're done for."

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and spoke calmly, "You think I didn't see this was a setup?"

The smile on Bing Die's face stiffened.

"Come out, you skulking one — you've watched long enough, haven't you?" Yang Kai said, and with a wave of his hand he slapped at a spot in the void; a massive palm imprint thundered toward that direction.

With a great boom an invisible force dissolved the palm imprint, but in that void a figure appeared in a strange manner.

Countless outer island disciples looked up and gasped in shock: "Great Elder!"

"Disciple greets the Great Elder!" Everyone came to their senses and hastily bowed, their expressions respectful.

The figure that had appeared in the void was none other than Ice Heart Valley's Great Elder!

Ran Yunting wore a light purple court robe, appearing resplendent and alluring, her aura as deep as an abyss and unfathomable; at this moment, however, her gaze on Yang Kai held a trace of astonishment.

She had not expected Yang Kai to have noticed her presence so long ago.
