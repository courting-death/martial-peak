## Chapter 1147 — The Scheming Yang Flame

Yang Kai believed that once he said it, Qian Tong would be even more convinced; as long as Qian Tong had no doubts, his side would be absolutely safe. With Qian Tong's protection, at least there would no longer be constant trouble from the Xu Family.

"I understand!" Wu Yi nodded.

“If you understand, then go on out. I’m going into seclusion,” Yang Kai said, waving his hand at them.

"Eldest Brother, what about the auction at Jubao Tower…" Wu Yi pursed her red lips and asked.

"You really want to go?" Yang Kai frowned.

To his surprise, not only did Wu Yi nod, but Yang Flame also looked forward to it with eager anticipation.

"If you want to go, then go." There was no need to stop them. To Yang Kai, an auction was merely a place to widen one’s horizons; letting them see the world would do them good. Wu Yi came from a minor family—no matter how experienced she was, she couldn't compare to disciples from great clans. And Yang Flame had lived such a miserable life before that she certainly hadn't seen much of the world; naturally she would be interested in an auction.

"What about you?" Wu Yi asked.

"If I don't come out of seclusion, I won't be going. Just be careful yourselves."

"Oh." Wu Yi replied, then she and Yang Flame walked out.

Yang Kai closed the stone chamber, sat cross-legged, and submerged his mind into the Sea of Consciousness.

In the Sea of Consciousness, two pristine masses of soul energy hovered in midair. Yang Kai manifested his Spirit Body and stared at them with excitement.

This was Yang Kai’s first time collecting the soul energy of an Origin Returning Realm master. Never before had one of that realm died before him, nor had he ever devoured the insights such an expert held toward the Heavenly and Martial Dao. That was why he’d had no idea that those of the Origin Returning Realm possessed a power called Shi. If not for today’s battle with Hong Zhen, he might not have encountered Shi for a long time to come—and this wondrous power stirred deep yearning in his heart.

Yet the strength of Origin Returning Realm experts rang alarm bells for Yang Kai. He had always fought beyond his rank: in the True Yuan Realm he could defeat Divine Roaming Realm, in Divine Roaming Realm he could overcome Saint Realm, in Saint Realm he could defeat Saint King Realm. Now that he had reached Saint King Realm, he had assumed defeating the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would be no problem, but now he realized he had been gravely mistaken.

The Origin Returning Realm and the Saint King Realm were essentially different. The chasm between them lay in one thing: Shi!

Sitting cross-legged, he drew the two masses of soul energy before him and began to carefully, reverently absorb their insights into the Heavenly and Martial Dao. If previously he had devoured others' soul energy like a glutton, now he savored it bite by bite. This was a rare opportunity; if he did not use it to understand what Shi was, next time he encountered Origin Returning Realm opponents he would still be helpless.

Time passed bit by bit. Yang Kai had never before devoured with such refinement; he wanted to squeeze every drop of essence from those two spirit-soul masses and brand it into the depths of his own soul.

Two days later the two pristine masses of soul energy had been consumed, and Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes.

He vaguely understood what Shi was, though Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother's strength was not high—only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Their grasp and use of Shi were merely introductory, so Yang Kai’s understanding of Shi based on them was naturally superficial.

Shi was not the same as what he had once called aura. Aura was something intangible and formless—an invisible pressure the strong exerted upon the weak, the natural bearing born of one who had long stood in a position of power, or the killing intent that erupted instinctively in battle. Aura was resolve and will—something that could neither be seen nor touched.

And that was only one component of Shi.

The Shi of Origin Returning Realm experts was a wondrous power formed by the fusion of aura, Saint Yuan, and Divine Sense, capable of directly inflicting lethal damage. It required a cultivator's understanding of Heavenly and Martial Dao to reach a certain level before it could be formed.

Shi was like an invisible field, but it truly existed and possessed tremendous suppressive and destructive force. Why could Origin Returning Realm experts easily slay Saint King Realm cultivators? It was because of Shi's absolute suppression. One drop of his Golden Blood erupting could not take down Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother—not because his Golden Blood was weak, but because the two of them had overlapping Shi that greatly slowed the Golden Blood's velocity, weakened its power, and anticipated its impact direction to avoid fatal spots.

If it had not been for that, they would have been dead already.

Understanding Shi was difficult. Hong Zhen had broken through to Origin Returning Realm more than a decade ago, and even now his grasp of Shi had only just begun. His Senior Brother was slightly stronger than him, but not by much.

Yang Kai also vaguely realized one thing: only after a cultivator's Shi at the Origin Returning Realm was perfected would there be a chance to ascend to the Void King Realm!

Although Qian Tong had reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, Yang Kai guessed his Shi was not perfected. In other words, no matter how hard Qian Tong trained or how much he strengthened his Saint Yuan, without a perfected Shi he could not reach the next realm; Shi was the greatest obstacle before him—an insurmountable barrier.

This was likely one of the main reasons why Void King Realm experts were so scarce within the Hengluo Star Domain. Once cultivation reached such a level, advancement was no longer merely a matter of strengthening the body—it required comprehensive improvement in every aspect of one’s being.

After understanding all this, Yang Kai immediately began studying Shi. He discarded the flawed comprehension of Shi held by Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother, instead infusing it with his own insights and perspective, attempting to merge his aura, Saint Yuan, and Divine Sense into one.

During the battle with Hong Zhen he had fleetingly touched a trace of Shi's mystery, but it had been only a flash; no matter how he tried to recall it now he could not remember the sensation, which left him vexed.

He experimented again and again but always felt something was off. After ten days he had to give up his current plan to study Shi.

He felt his strength was still too low; if he reached the Second or Third Stage of Saint King Realm it would likely be much easier. After all, this wondrous power belonged to the Origin Returning Realm—him touching even a bit now was already a fortunate fluke.

Yang Kai was not one to split hairs. Having thought this through, he immediately emerged from seclusion and resolved to wait until his cultivation improved, then absorb more soul energy from Origin Returning Realm experts and return to study Shi, which would surely yield twice the result with half the effort.

No sooner had he opened the stone door than he saw Wu Yi come running up excitedly, calling out, "Eldest Brother, you came out at the perfect time."

"What has you so happy?" Yang Kai eyed her suspiciously.

"To attend the auction at Jubao Tower." Wu Yi hurriedly replied.

"It's today?" Yang Kai was stunned; he thought it was far too coincidental.

"Yes." Wu Yi nodded, then leaned toward Yang Kai and whispered, "Yang Flame refined an Origin-Grade Middle-Level secret treasure and an Origin-Grade Lower-Level secret treasure, planning to bring them to the auction to sell."

"Is she insane?" Yang Kai was shocked and barked, "Where is she?"

"I'm here." Yang Flame's figure flickered out from behind.

"What are you thinking?" Yang Kai looked at her sternly. "Didn't I tell you not to be too showy? Don't you worry about drawing attention? It's only been a few days—how could you forget so quickly?"

Yang Flame sneered, "As long as the three of us don't say anything, who would know these treasures were refined by me?"

"That would still attract too much notice." Yang Kai shook his head. "The best artificer on Dark Star is only Origin-Grade Lower-Level; how would you explain suddenly producing an Origin-Grade Middle-Level treasure?"

"It won't, Eldest Brother." Wu Yi smiled faintly. "Although artificers and alchemists on Dark Star are generally low-grade, there are still a few Origin-Grade Middle-Level, even Origin-Grade Upper-Level treasures here and there. So one Origin-Grade Middle-Level secret treasure won't cause too big a stir."

Yang Kai frowned and immediately understood. The artificer and alchemist levels on Dark Star were low now, but that didn't mean they were always so. Fine treasures could be preserved for thousands or tens of thousands of years without damage; there must be remnants here, perhaps even Void King-Grade treasures. But if such things existed, they would likely be ancestral treasures of powerful forces and would rarely be used.

Thinking this through, Yang Kai's expression cleared slightly and he nodded. "That said, there's really no need to sell treasures of this caliber—wouldn't it be better to keep them for ourselves?"

"If we don't sell treasures, where will we get Saint Crystals to buy materials and set formations?" Yang Flame snorted. "We're all broke now. This auction is a rare opportunity."

Yang Kai realized she was right. Yang Flame's setting of arrays indeed cost money, and it was thanks to her array that last time they were able to stop Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother; such matters couldn't be sloppy and deserved strong support.

"Bring out what you refined; let me see!"

Seeing Yang Kai no longer opposed, Wu Yi excitedly produced two offensive treasures: a soft whip and a double-pronged stabbing fork. Yang Kai could tell at a glance that both were forged from the tail and dual pincers of a Ninth-Tier demonic beast, the Red-Tailed Purple-Armored Crab. They gave off pulses of unnerving energy. Both items were exquisitely crafted—practical and beautiful, very suitable for women.

Yang Flame was vicious—she deliberately refined the treasures like this to bleed those men dry, thought Yang Kai inwardly, feeling a chill.

"Moreover, Eldest Brother, the reason I support Yang Flame selling these two items is to make Elder Qian even more sure of your non-existent master's prowess! Others won't know where our treasures came from; Elder Qian will surely assume they were made by your master. Once he believes that, he'll treat us even better in the future." Wu Yi explained.

Yang Kai nodded approvingly. "Thoughtful planning. In that case, go."

When Yang Kai agreed, Wu Yi and Yang Flame exchanged smiles.

"How long until the auction starts?" Yang Kai suddenly asked.

"About three hours, but it's fine. I already went to Tianyun City earlier to give Elder Qian notice that we'll have items consigned for auction. When we arrive he'll make the arrangements."

"That's good. By the way, Wu Yi, do you know which pills fetch the highest prices?" Yang Kai suddenly added.
