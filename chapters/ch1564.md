## Chapter 1564 — Yao Star Di Chen

"Junior Brother, what is this for?" Xia Ningshang poked her small head over and asked, puzzled.

"This is the shortcut," Yang Kai said with a faint smile, explaining it to her carefully.

Upon hearing that Shan Qingluo and Biluo had gone straight into the Star Domain from here, Xia Ningshang's curiosity was instantly piqued.

She finally understood who Yang Kai had meant; she couldn't help but press her lips into a secret smile, periodically glancing at Yang Kai with her clear, wide eyes, full of meaning.

"Mm, it's not what you think..." Yang Kai protested weakly. "Forget it, I'll study this thing. Do as you please."

"Mm." Xia Ningshang nodded, found a relatively clean spot nearby and sat down, simultaneously refining her understanding of True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy and attempting to condense her own Shi.

Yang Kai reached out and rubbed the strange patterns and motifs on the altar before him, releasing his Divine Sense to probe them.

If Shan Qingluo and Biluo could travel to Yao Star Di Chen from here, then this altar must possess the miracle of linking the two ends of space; in other words, if the conditions were met, this altar could form a passage between two spatial points, ignoring the barriers of space.

This was more profound than even the most powerful Space Arrays.

Yang Kai knew that within the Star Domain there existed some of the oldest Space Arrays capable of transmitting cultivators from one cultivation star to another, spanning countless millions of li, but such Space Arrays were exceedingly rare; not only scarce, many of them were damaged, and using them carried tremendous risk.

Perhaps someone like Mo Xiaosheng of the Battle Sky Alliance could repair ordinary Space Arrays, but against this special kind of Space Array he would be utterly helpless.

Thus, generally speaking, even those powers that possessed such special Space Arrays would hesitate to use them unless absolutely necessary. They would rather take a warship and sail slowly, spending vast amounts of time to reach their destination than gamble their lives.

The best way to activate the altar before him was through Shan Qingluo's bloodline. Back then she and Biluo had accidentally opened the altar with their own blood.

But Yang Kai could not borrow that method; though his Golden Blood was powerful, it did not have the effect of Shan Qingluo's bloodline.

He could only rely on his own profound comprehension of Spatial Force.

One by one the ancient characters responded to his probing with the stillness of an ancient well, showing no reaction. Yang Kai remained unhurried; on the contrary, he immersed his spirit ever deeper.

Gradually, he felt something marvelous.

Those ancient characters seemed to possess lives of their own, and subtle links existed between them.

Yang Kai had an inkling of understanding.

He tried again and again, pondering bit by bit; he felt himself making some gains, yet when he examined things closely he found nothing conclusive...

Time flowed on. The Little Senior Sister sat quietly at his side, not disturbing Yang Kai; she was lost in condensing her Shi and comprehending the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy, entirely unaware of the motions around her.

One day, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes; radiance flashed from them as if he had obtained a result.

He mobilized his Spatial Force, letting that wondrous power thread through the ancient altar, linking the intricate characters together.

Like threading a needle, the connections between those characters tightened until they were inseparable.

When the Spatial Force pierced the final character, the patterns on the altar suddenly burst with light, as if given new life, and actually floated up from the altar.

They swam through the void like fish, rearranging themselves, and ultimately formed the spectral outline of a great gate before Yang Kai.

"Little Senior Sister!" Yang Kai barked.

Xia Ningshang quickly reined in her mind; her delicate body swayed as she came to Yang Kai's side and grasped his large hand.

She knew the moment had come!

Yang Kai did not delay either. He concentrated on the closed spectral gate before him, his face grimmer than it had ever been.

Although he had succeeded in comprehending the altar's secret with his mastery of Spatial Force and brought the gate's apparition into being, he possessed no key to open it.

Shan Qingluo's bloodline served as the key to that gate.

But Yang Kai had his own method.

He condensed Spatial Force to his fingertips, the motion deceptively slow, then suddenly jabbed forward and slashed downward with force.

The void seemed to tremble; a crack appeared on the closed gate. At first the fissure was tiny, nearly imperceptible, but it expanded at great speed.

In the blink of an eye it tore the gate apart, revealing a pitch-black passage.

It connected the void passage between two points of space separated by countless millions of li!

Inside was utter void and chaos, like the gaping maw of a ferocious beast, capable of devouring everything in the world.

Xia Ningshang's small body tensed and she gripped Yang Kai's large hand tighter.

Yang Kai did not hesitate; he pulled Xia Ningshang and plunged in. Once their figures vanished, the jet-black passage closed and then vanished.

Around them all was stillness. There was no sound, no light; before Xia Ningshang and Yang Kai lay only absolute darkness.

Yet, in that gloom, Xia Ningshang could feel a strange force flowing by her side, like a rushing river intent on drowning her.

But Yang Kai sheltered her!

This was a space rift, a mysterious, unknowable place that ordinary beings could hardly reach, a forbidden zone where nothing could easily survive.

Any powerful figure might be lost within, sink into that strange world, and ultimately have body and mind devoured by the darkness, never to return.

Even Yang Kai had to stay on the highest alert while moving through this place, his Divine Sense constantly probing every direction as he led Xia Ningshang to evade the killing intents lurking within the void.

This eerie place seemed to affect living beings' thoughts and their sense of time.

Yang Kai could only frantically mobilize Spatial Force to resist the interference coming from all directions.

When Shan Qingluo and Biluo used the altar to enter Yao Star Di Chen back then, they faced no great danger because their bloodlines matched. Yang Kai, however, had forcibly opened the altar by special means; the risks he bore were immeasurably greater than those faced by the Enchantress Queen.

Fortunately, his attainments in Spatial Force were indeed considerable; although he trod precariously, he could barely cope.

It was impossible to say how much time passed before Yang Kai suddenly jolted, dashed in a certain direction with Xia Ningshang, and upon arriving there cut through the space in front of them, tearing open reality and hurling them both out of that mysterious, unknowable place.

Only then did the Little Senior Sister come to her senses; her bewildered, beautiful eyes finally cleared.

She had thought it all but an instant, but she did not know Yang Kai had struggled and wandered inside the space rift with her for many days.

That mysterious place had warped Xia Ningshang's sense of the passage of time.

This seemed to be an underground cavern—damp and dim—yet before them lay scattered pale-white bones. Judging from their size, the creature to whom they once belonged must have been colossal.

"This place is..." Xia Ningshang looked around in confusion.

Yang Kai stepped forward, picked up a fragment of bone and examined it carefully. After a moment he grinned: "We're here. This is Yao Star Di Chen!"

"Yao Star Di Chen?" Xia Ningshang murmured. "The star where the Queen Sister is?"

"Mm!" Yang Kai nodded. His ability to make that judgment was thanks to the ashen bones on the ground.

If he was right, those pale bones should be the remains of the ancient variant Heavenly Moon Demon Spider.

When Shan Qingluo and Biluo had stranded here years ago, the first thing they encountered had been the bones of a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider. Shan Qingluo absorbed the primordial power of that ancient variant, which is why Lady Chi Yue took notice and accepted her as an adopted daughter, allowing her to thrive on Di Chen Star.

Otherwise, as a human, how could she have established herself on this yao star? She certainly could not have reached the terrifying realm of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm in only a few dozen years.

The primordial power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider had aided Shan Qingluo greatly. Her bloodline already bore traces of that spider, enabling her to activate the altar and attain the unique opportunity meant for her.

Fate and opportunity were truly mysterious. Despite Yang Kai's many years of hard work and not bad luck, he had only broken through to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, while Shan Qingluo had long since outpaced him.

Yang Kai pondered, recalling the information Biluo had revealed to him at the Imperial Garden.

He didn’t know much about the Yao Star Di Chen — only that it was a cultivation star dominated by the yao. Although humans also existed there, they had long since been reduced to little more than attendants and subordinates.

Humans had their own advantages. The yao were powerful, but they did not utterly exterminate humans; they mostly left them be unless a human emerged who threatened the yao's rule, in which case yao experts would kill them.

On Di Chen Star, humans had little status.

The Ten Great Lords were the rulers of Di Chen Star; each was a Void King Realm expert.

Lady Chi Yue, who had taken Shan Qingluo as an adopted daughter, was one of them.

Yang Kai pondered and found that the information he had was only this meager scrap, which left him with a bit of a headache.

"Let's leave first," Yang Kai told Xia Ningshang, leading her out of the underground cavern.

Upon emerging, Yang Kai discovered before him a range of towering, precipitous mountains, majestic and perilous; Spiritual Qi was abundant, but the air was thick with yao qi.

From the mountain wilds came the occasional roar and clash of ferocious demonic beasts.

He truly could not imagine how Shan Qingluo had once escaped this place safely; she must have endured many hardships.

Gathering his mind, Yang Kai summoned the Star Shuttle and, with Xia Ningshang, swaggered across the canopy of the forest.

This place might be lethally dangerous to others, but to Yang Kai it meant little; below the Void King Realm he feared no one. Even ordinary Void King Realm experts he could face calmly.

Having cultivated Spatial Force, few could push him to the brink unless, like Qi Tianche of Star Emperor Mountain, they trapped him in a Small Xuan Realm.

That alone was not enough; they would still need absolute martial might to suppress him.

Qi Tianche lacked that ability, which was why he died...
