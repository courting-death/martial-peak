## Chapter 387 — Disaster of Misfortune

The crowd waited at the spot for less than half a stick of incense's time when Tu Feng returned, drenched in blood.

The killing intent on him was as thick as substance, as if a god of slaughter had descended upon the world. Even figures like Qiu Yimeng felt a chill run down their spine upon seeing him.

Tu Feng held up two severed heads in his hands—those of the two masters who had previously been entangled with him and Tang Yuxian.

In a hurry, Tu Feng tossed the severed heads onto the ground, his tone icy as he said, “All of them committed suicide, but one escaped.”

In his pursuit, the masters at the Seventh Stage and Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm had immediately bitten their tongues and committed suicide after suffering severe wounds; the only one who was the strongest had fled in panic, saving his own life.

“The people here are all dead too,” Tang Yuxian said, her gaze cold.

“Interesting,” Yang Kai's expression turned grim, a strange smile on his face. “The people behind this group indeed have some means!”

Otherwise, these assassins would not have taken such extreme measures at the last moment, willing to discard their lives rather than reveal any information.

“Along the way, only the Lü Family knows your whereabouts, Young Master!” Tu Feng's face was filled with killing intent as he said in a deep voice.

He was somewhat angry and ashamed.

This assassination had occurred right under his and Tang Yuxian’s noses; the enemy had used some sort of means to completely shield all their auras, leaving their two Blood Servants without any awareness. If not for Yang Kai's own vigilance at a critical moment, they might have truly fallen into their trap this time.

With the protection of the two powerful Blood Servants, the young master of the Yang Family had almost been killed! If this news were to spread, the reputation of the Blood Servants' Hall would be ruined, and both of them would face punishment from their family, perhaps even being forced to end their own lives to apologize.

Such a possibility was very real!

In other words, Yang Kai's alertness not only saved his own life, but essentially saved both him and Tang Yuxian.

While feeling grateful, Tu Feng also felt a wave of shame, and he immediately associated the blame with the Lü Family. It wasn't that he held any malice. It was just that with the Blood Fury Technique augmenting him, his killing intent surged, and he was unable to think calmly.

Moreover, Tu Feng's previous encounter with the Lü Family a few days back had also left him quite angry, causing him to vent all his frustrations.

Upon hearing this, Qiu Yimeng’s expression changed, and she hurriedly said, “Lü Liang would absolutely not do such a self-destructive act!”

Tu Feng had no regard for Qiu Yimeng's identity or face, coldly snorting, “Lü Liang might not, but one cannot guarantee that the other members of the Lü Family wouldn’t!”

Qiu Yimeng suddenly froze, unsure how to respond. She merely looked at Yang Kai, hoping he wouldn’t be unreasonable like Tu Feng.

Yang Kai said nothing, merely frowning as he looked around, surveying the battlefield strewn with bodies. Suddenly, he looked up at the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle overhead and calmly said, “This isn’t related to the Lü Family; the young eagle must have exposed our location! This time, we were too careless!”

Seeing him say this, Qiu Yimeng couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. Although Lü Liang's actions previously had left her feeling somewhat displeased, the Lü Family had relied on the Qiu Family to develop. Over the years, the Lü Family had supplied the Qiu Family with numerous valuable resources, so as the young lady of the Qiu Family, she felt some obligation and responsibility to protect the Lü Family's safety within her capabilities.

“That beast!” Tang Yuxian ground her teeth, glaring hatefully at the circling Golden Feather Eagle.

Yang Kai said faintly, “For so many years, no one dared to target the disciples of the Yang Family. So whether it was I or you, we never expected this change. Let this be a lesson learned!”

As he spoke, he blew a sharp whistle, and the Golden Feather Eagle immediately dove down.

With a strange smile, Yang Kai glanced at Qiu Yimeng and said, “Even though this incident isn’t related to the Lü Family, I hope the news of today reaches Lü Liang's ears, and it should be conveyed by the Qiu Family!”

Qiu Yimeng was momentarily taken aback and did not understand why Yang Kai suddenly said this. With a frown, she pondered for a while. Suddenly, her heart filled with resentment as she gritted her teeth and cursed, “You! What’s the point of thinking about this at such a time! You truly have a mind full of schemes; it’s not necessary to elaborate to this degree, I really... sigh, I really have to hand it to you.”

“Humph! They brought this upon themselves. Do they think this young master is as useless as a pile of mud?” Yang Kai sneered.

Upon hearing him say this, the others realized that he still cared somewhat about how the Lü Family treated him.

He might not care for the assistance of the Lü Family, but he would not allow others to look down upon him. Those who underestimated him would eventually pay the price.

However, the two’s cryptic exchanges left the two Blood Servants and Luo Xiaoman somewhat confused.

“Sister Qiu, what do you mean by that?” Luo Xiaoman, innocent and straightforward, didn’t understand and asked directly.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian also looked at her eagerly, wanting to know what kind of secrets had made Qiu Yimeng so disdain Yang Kai's actions.

Qiu Yimeng bitterly smiled as she looked at Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, saying, “I told you that this young master is the type to settle scores. You still didn’t believe it... Humph. To put it this way, while this incident indeed has nothing to do with the Lü Family, on this journey, Yang Kai only stayed at the Lü Family. If the news of his ambush today reaches Lü Liang, just think about how he will react.”

Tu Feng was stunned for a moment, then suddenly understood and slapped his thigh. “Lü Liang will definitely be worried sick, fearing that Young Master suspects him of leaking information!”

“To prove his innocence, Lü Liang will definitely come to Zhongdu to clarify things with Young Master! Since he’s coming to clarify, he will probably have to bring some gifts.” Tang Yuxian covered her mouth, looking at Yang Kai with surprise and amusement, clearly not expecting him to think of such a crafty idea in that moment.

Those gifts were indeed the key!

“And, this was also information transmitted from my Qiu Family,” Qiu Yimeng gritted her teeth in hatred. “Lü Liang will definitely assume that my Qiu Family is willing to play this mediator role, and as long as he prepares the gifts, Yang Kai will surely not hold him responsible. This Young Master is clearly taking advantage of the situation to gather wealth!”

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian looked at Yang Kai in astonishment and admiration.

Such intricate thoughts were something they could not even begin to fathom.

Having just encountered a life-threatening situation, most people should have been shaken, savoring the joy of surviving a calamity.

But this young master of their family was calm and composed, not only appearing unperturbed but immediately turning his thoughts to someone unrelated—wasn't his mind racing a bit too fast?

The Lü Family, this time… was truly facing a disaster of misfortune!

For a moment, both Blood Servants couldn't help but feel some sympathy for Lü Liang. They really didn’t know how the head of the Lü Family would react when he learned the truth.

Perhaps even if he found out, he would have to resign himself to fate! After all, Yang Kai had only stayed at his home throughout this journey.

“Tell Lü Liang not to come himself; it's enough to send the things over,” Yang Kai added, indifferent.

Qiu Yimeng snorted, clearly too lazy to respond to him.

“Let’s leave here before discussing anything else,” Yang Kai's expression grew solemn as he waved his hand.

The five rare Treading Cloud Steeds, hard to nurture and costly, had long since been washed away by the current, so the five could only fly through the air.

While Tang Yuxian's injuries weren't severe, they weren't light either. As for Tu Feng, he hadn’t been injured, but after an hour, the effects of the Blood Fury Technique would wear off, causing his energy and blood to suddenly weaken.

The two Blood Servants would take at least ten days to recover fully.

Having just suffered an ambush attack, none of them dared to be ostentatious.

In a secluded mountain hollow, the five stopped to rest.

Yang Kai personally ventured out to catch some food, which made the two Blood Servants feel increasingly unsettled and overwhelmed with gratitude.

At night, the five sat together roasting game.

The atmosphere was somewhat gloomy; the two Blood Servants felt guilty for their apparent incompetence and were too embarrassed to speak. Whenever they glanced at Yang Kai, their eyes were filled with remorse, while Qiu Yimeng was secretly angry at Yang Kai for taking advantage of the situation and naturally ignored him. Luo Xiaoman, seeing the strange atmosphere, remained silent, acting as meek as a rabbit.

Only Yang Kai sat by the campfire, his gaze calmly observing the flickering flames, reflecting on the day’s encounters and piecing together everything in his mind, speculating on the possibilities.

After a long while, Yang Kai straightened up and suddenly spoke, “You don’t need to feel guilty; this incident wasn't targeted at me.”

“Young Master…” Tang Yuxian pursed her lips, feeling ashamed.

Yang Kai waved his hand. “It’s not about comforting you; this incident truly wasn’t aimed at me. Perhaps they learned of our movements several days ago, which is why they laid an ambush at the river, knowing that to cross the Lan River, we must find a ferry, and using the ferry to cross the river gave them this opportunity.”

Hearing him speak so seriously, the others couldn’t help but listen closely.

“Their deployment of strength was very targeted; the three strongest ones were to restrain the two Blood Servants! The rest were responsible for killing disciples of the Yang Family! There were quite a number of those people, and their strength was good. But when they were chasing me, they didn’t display any deep-seated hatred, indicating they held no grudge against me personally.”

Tu Feng nodded and said, “During the battle, the strongest one also mentioned something; it seemed they were targeting all the young masters of the Yang Family!”

“Indeed. It was merely a coincidence that they encountered me. If any other disciples of the Yang Family had passed by, they would surely have met the same fate.”

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian couldn’t help but feel relieved, grateful that it was Yang Kai who passed through here. If it had been any other young master of the Yang Family, given the skills and numbers of those assassins, they would be doomed!

“Did you notice the distribution of their strength?” Yang Kai asked with a strange smile, hinting at something.

“Distribution of strength?” Tu Feng frowned.

“Indeed, one was at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, one at the Seventh Stage, one at the Fifth Stage, one at the Third Stage, and one at the First Stage…” Yang Kai chuckled, “Apart from that, they were all at the True Essence Realm. This distribution of strength in the Divine Roaming Realm—haven't you noticed any problems?”
