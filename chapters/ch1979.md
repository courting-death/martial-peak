## Chapter 1979 — Digging at the Base

Shopkeeper Kang had not had a good month; the Danqi Pavilion under the Commerce Guild had acted despicably and shamelessly, ignoring industry ethics and poaching his two pillar pillmasters, leaving him with grievances he could not voice.

If this matter truly forced the Spiritual Pill shop to close, then his prospects within the Commerce Guild would be finished.

He had only just managed to find a Yang Kai and had just signed a Soul Contract, so there was hope Yang Kai could become the Spiritual Pill shop’s second pillmaster to steady the situation; unexpectedly, at this crucial moment came news that Pillmaster Fan intended to leave.

If Pillmaster Fan really left, then the situation he had painstakingly restored would very likely tip once more, and his future would be worrying indeed.

He was so anxious his throat felt like it was on fire as he hurriedly led Yang Kai toward the backyard; before they arrived they heard Fan Hong’s shouting: “Who dares stop me? I’m done — get out of my way! If you don’t, don’t blame me for being rude.”

In the backyard, a few workers were trying to reason with him, yet they still seemed unable to restrain Fan Hong.

Hearing that, Shopkeeper Kang knew it did not bode well and quickened his pace; in the blink of an eye he arrived at the backyard and saw Fan Hong’s furious countenance, his whole body trembling with power as if he were about to come to blows.

But upon seeing Shopkeeper Kang, Fan Hong frowned and a trace of shame flickered deep in his eyes.

“Pillmaster Fan, what are you doing?” Shopkeeper Kang, though angered that Fan Hong caused trouble at such a time, dared not speak too harshly; he could only ask with a distressed expression.

Fan Hong sighed and said, “Shopkeeper Kang, Fan Hong owes you an apology. It’s just that my decision is already made; I hope Shopkeeper Kang will forgive me.”

“Is it that the pay I offered was insufficient? Or did someone else offer you a better price? If so, we can discuss it!” Shopkeeper Kang knew the most important thing was to discover why Fan Hong wanted to leave the Spiritual Pill shop, so he could address the root cause.

“Shopkeeper Kang, you insult me by saying that. Ever since I came to Fenglin City I have settled at the Spiritual Pill shop and have brewed pills for ten years — I already considered this place my home. Even if somewhere else offered more, I would not be tempted,” Fan Hong declared with blazing indignation, as if Kang’s words had wounded his honor.

Shopkeeper Kang forced a bitter smile and said, “If that isn’t the reason, then why would Pillmaster Fan suddenly want to leave?”

Fan Hong sighed and said, “Shopkeeper Kang, this past month I have been refining pills day and night. I am utterly exhausted. If this continues, I fear I will be unable to go on. Please, Shopkeeper Kang, have mercy and let me go.”

Hearing that, Shopkeeper Kang was momentarily at a loss for words.

While the two spoke, Yang Kai observed Fan Hong and found that, as he had said, the man had likely overexerted himself — his spirit was in poor state, his power fluctuated erratically, his hair was disheveled, his eye sockets hollowed — all signs of extreme fatigue.

Moreover, Fan Hong’s own strength was not high; he was only at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

With such cultivation, Yang Kai reckoned that even if Fan Hong were a Void King-Grade pillmaster, at best he would only qualify as Void King-Grade Lower-Level.

After all, pill refining often required internal power support; the weaker the power, the less hope of producing fine Spiritual Pills. But pillmasters spent their years dealing with Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines — where was the time to cultivate? Without cultivation, where did the great power come from? Without great power, how could one sustain high-intensity refining?

It had almost become a vicious cycle within the pillmaster trade.

“It was my oversight — please forgive me, Pillmaster Fan!” Shopkeeper Kang, aware that Fan Hong truly had given too much this month, quickly bowed.

Fan Hong exclaimed in alarm, “Shopkeeper Kang, you flatter me too much.”

Shopkeeper Kang shook his head and said, “It was my fault; but things are better now — I’ve found another pillmaster, so we no longer need you to refine Spiritual Pills as before. Why not return, rest for a few days, and then come back to the shop?”

“Another pillmaster?” Fan Hong was astonished; his gaze swept the crowd and finally fixed on the unfamiliar Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave him a slight smile.

“Pillmaster Fan, I’ve certainly seen all you’ve done for the Spiritual Pill shop. There is no need for many words — why don’t you go back and rest for a few days, and return when you feel ready?” Shopkeeper Kang looked at Fan Hong earnestly, unwilling in any way to let him go.

“This…” Fan Hong looked troubled, apparently hesitant.

Just as Shopkeeper Kang prepared to press his advantage and persuade Fan Hong further, a clear, pleasing voice sounded from outside: “Pillmaster Fan, you are here — the time has come; I have come personally to fetch you.”

At those words, Fan Hong’s face changed dramatically — the pallor caused by exhaustion flushed to a purple-red like liver, and he was mortified beyond measure.

Shopkeeper Kang froze for a moment, then ground his teeth and hissed, “Zhuo Ningsi!”

His face was full of loathing, as though he bore some great hatred for the woman called Zhuo Ningsi.

Yang Kai’s eyes flicked; he half understood and smiled faintly as he looked at Fan Hong.

Fan Hong was completely embarrassed, his gaze flitting, his lips moving as if cursing silently.

When Shopkeeper Kang’s gaze turned toward him, Fan Hong’s face flushed red; he wished a hole would open and swallow him.

“I understand!” Shopkeeper Kang coldly smiled. “Pillmaster Fan, so you truly have found a better place to go. If that is the case, you need only have said so — this old man would have congratulated you; there’s no need for those petty excuses.”

Fan Hong ground his teeth, humiliated and angry: “What do you mean by that, Shopkeeper Kang? Are you saying my efforts this past month were false? I vomited blood several times to rush produce Spiritual Pills for the shop. If not for my support, the Spiritual Pill shop would have closed long ago.”

He grew more and more impassioned, speaking in lofty indignation.

Hearing that, Shopkeeper Kang’s brow furrowed deeply; he sighed slowly, as if aging a great deal, and nodded: “Pillmaster Fan is right — if not for you, the Spiritual Pill shop would indeed have long ago shut its doors.”

“Hmph! If you understand that, then there’s no need to say more,” Fan Hong snorted coldly. “I’m also thinking of my own future; it’s dog-eat-dog in this world. Shopkeeper Kang, take care — I bid you farewell!”

With that he shoved past the two workers blocking his way and strode out.

When he passed Yang Kai, he turned and gave Yang Kai a slight, malicious smile: “You’re doomed now.”

Yang Kai shrugged, noncommittal.

Shopkeeper Kang stood there, pondering for a moment, then suddenly turned and followed after Fan Hong.

Outside the Spiritual Pill shop, a sultry beauty dressed rather revealingly stood smiling at the gate, accompanied by several maidservants; her coquettish smile and the exposed white skin and faintly revealed cleavage drew the eyes of many passing martial artists.

She paid them no mind; rather, she seemed to relish their attention, occasionally casting flirtatious glances that sent many men’s hearts into chaos.

Fan Hong hurried out of the Spiritual Pill shop and rushed to the woman's side, leaning in and whispering, "Didn't I say I'd come over? What do you mean by turning up here now?"

Zhuo Ningsi laughed coquettishly and, her red lips moving, said, “What’s the matter? I came myself to fetch you — isn’t that fine?”

“You woman... ah!” Fan Hong looked helpless.

Zhuo Ningsi said, “If you want to keep things unknown, don’t do them. You can hide it for a while, but do you expect to hide it forever? Besides, it’s only switching places to refine pills — what’s so shameful about that?”

Fan Hong’s face turned sullen and he said nothing.

He knew Zhuo Ningsi had not come merely to welcome him, but to undermine the Spiritual Pill shop’s morale, and that he was simply a pawn she could use.

So he was aware his words would be of no use.

As they spoke, Shopkeeper Kang had already come out and glared at the sensuous beauty as if flames issued from his eyes.

Zhuo Ningsi cried out in mock alarm and patted her heaving bosom: “Shopkeeper Kang, your gaze is so fierce — as if you’d eat me up. But Shopkeeper Kang, you’re so old now, can you really still manage?”

By the end of the sentence she was already covering her mouth and giggling.

“Shopkeeper Zhuo!” Shopkeeper Kang was unmoved by her beauty and simply sneered coldly: “Nice method — I admire it greatly.”

“Oh my—what does Shopkeeper Kang mean by that? This humble woman simply doesn’t understand.” Zhuo Ningsi’s waist swayed like a willow, and a delicate maiden’s fan suddenly appeared in her hand, which she began to flutter lightly.

“We’re all sensible people; no need to play dumb. But if Shopkeeper Zhuo thinks that will make the Spiritual Pill shop close, then you are very much mistaken,” Shopkeeper Kang said with a scornful smile.

“Heh heh...” Zhuo Ningsi used her fan to hide her small mouth; her beautiful eyes regarded Shopkeeper Kang as she said, “I recall Shopkeeper Kang used to have three Void King-Grade pillmasters under him, but now they all seem to have gone to my Danqi Pavilion. Could it be that Shopkeeper Kang himself is a master of pill-craft and intends to don the armor and fight? Old man, you’re not young — take care of your health.”

“Hmph, Fenglin City is so big — do you think Void King-Grade pillmasters are that hard to find?” Shopkeeper Kang smiled at her words.

Zhuo Ningsi was stunned and asked suspiciously, “Shopkeeper Kang, do you have other pillmasters?”

Fan Hong sidled up and whispered a few words into Zhuo Ningsi’s ear.

Zhuo Ningsi’s dark brows twitched and her gaze immediately shifted to Yang Kai; her eyes brightened and she coquettishly asked, “Honored Pillmaster, may I ask your surname?”

“Yang.”

“So you are Pillmaster Yang — I pay my respects.” Zhuo Ningsi smiled and said, “Pillmaster Yang is young and has decent cultivation and can even refine pills — I truly admire you.”

“I’ve always had many admirers,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Zhuo Ningsi paused slightly, apparently not expecting Yang Kai to be so shameless, but she did not mind; her smile remained as she continued, “Would Pillmaster Yang be interested in refining at my Danqi Pavilion? I could offer Pillmaster Yang...”

“Zhuo Ningsi!”

Before she could finish, Shopkeeper Kang suddenly shouted in a furious roar.
