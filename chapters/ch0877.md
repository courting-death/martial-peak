## Chapter 877 — Return to the Nine Peaks

Time passed in the blink of an eye; half a month later, the day agreed upon with the Great Yao Lord arrived.

The Ancient Demon Clan stood ready and everything had been arranged; they only waited for Yang Kai's order to enter the Nine Peaks.

Because of Yang Kai, the Ancient Demon Clan had long since taken the Nine Peaks as their new home, and now they brimmed with expectation, imagining what kind of secluded paradise awaited them there.

Groups gathered together, pointing toward the Nine Peaks and whispering among themselves.

Yang Kai's divine sense spread out to probe the situation at the Nine Peaks. Since last night, many demonic beasts and yao experts had been leaving in succession; by now there was scarcely any life left inside.

Those who remained were the pill refiners and artifact forgers who originally belonged to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

When Yang Kai had made the agreement with the Great Lord a few years ago, he had left these alchemists and forgers behind to continue their work for the yao; now that the yao were departing, the Great Lord kept his promise and did not take them away.

Yang Kai nodded inwardly, feeling that the Great Lord was indeed a decent sort.

A seven-colored light suddenly appeared before his eyes as Caidie fluttered her wings and hovered in midair; after sweeping her gaze around she fixed her eyes on Yang Kai and said coldly, “My clan has fully withdrawn; you may return. The Great Lord asked me to pass along his thanks for the progress your efforts have brought our people these past years, and you are always welcome to visit the Beast Sea Great Forest.”

“Miss Caidie, thank you for your hard work. Please convey my greetings to the Great Lord; I will visit when I have the time,” Yang Kai said with a slight smile and a nod.

“Message delivered, farewell!” Caidie snorted, turned, and flew away.

“That girl… nasty temper,” Yinya muttered beside him, sounding somewhat displeased.

“Strong, about a Stage above me, and very pretty!” Xueji chuckled lecherously as he watched Caidie depart.

“Both of you, watch your tongues; sometimes trouble comes from careless words!” Li Rong scolded. “My clan has only just returned to the world—don’t stir up trouble.”

Yinya and Xueji hastily nodded, indicating they understood.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai waved his hand and led the way.

Between the peaks the land was lush and alive with birdsong and blooms; the Nine Peaks’ array still operated, making the area's Spiritual Qi exceptionally dense.

The Ancient Demon Clan immediately took a liking to the place upon entering; many demons looked this way and that, visibly elated.

The conditions here were incomparably better than at Mogu Castle; living here made one feel comfortable in body and mind.

Many clan members felt a surreal sensation; even after leaving that Small Xuan Realm for two or three months, they sometimes still thought they lived in that world without sun, moon, or stars.

Only when they saw the outside wonders did they abruptly awaken.

On one central peak, before the great hall where the Great Lord had once stood, roughly a hundred people stood in solemn waiting.

Those hundred were all pill refiners and artifact forgers of various ages and both sexes; their cultivations were not high—the strongest among them was only at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

When Yang Kai led over a thousand Ancient Demon Clan members to that spot, the hundred immediately bowed and greeted, “Hail Saint Lord. Saint Lord, you have finally returned.”

“Thank you for your hard work,” Yang Kai replied with a slight nod. “Having you serve the yao for nearly three years was unavoidable. I ask for your forgiveness.”

“Not hard at all!” The eldest and strongest among them stepped forward. “The yao treated us well and were very courteous; Saint Lord, you worry too much.”

Yang Kai nodded and pronounced in a clear voice, “Now that I have returned, the Sacred Land will be as it once was, and henceforth no one will dare trample its dignity. Anyone who dares to invade will be exterminated!”

The alchemists and forgers grew excited and cheered loudly.

The elder glanced at the Ancient Demon Clan members and frowned slightly; though he did not understand why Yang Kai had brought demons, he did not press the matter and only asked suspiciously, “Where are Elder Xu Hui and the others? Why haven’t they returned?”

“They were always within the Sacred Land,” Yang Kai said with a chuckle. “Wait here; I’ll go release Elder Xu Hui and the others.”

He turned and reminded Li Rong, “You and the others wait here as well.”

Li Rong and the others lightly nodded.

Yang Kai’s figure flickered, and after a few flashes he arrived before the Sacred Tomb.

He pressed the Saint Lord’s Spirit Ring on his finger against a place on the bluestone and poured in True Yuan; an entrance to a Void Passage immediately opened on the great stone.

Inside the Sacred Tomb, thousands of disciples of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land waited silently.

In that pitch-dark space, their long years of waiting had become routine.

Though some grew impatient from time to time, the elders and the Saintess would soothe them.

The elders and the Saintess told them that one day the Saint Lord would return and bring them out; for that day they must do their best to raise their strength so the Sacred Land’s legacy would never again be abandoned.

Xu Hui and the others treated the evacuation years earlier as the greatest stain of their lives.

Over these years they spared no effort in cultivation.

The Sacred Tomb had always been the place where each generation’s Saint Lord and Saintess retreated to cultivate; though the environment was harsh, the Spiritual Qi there was exceptionally rich.

It was inexhaustible and ever flowing.

Such an opportunity was one no aspiring martial artist would willingly miss.

After nearly three years, almost everyone had made considerable progress; apart from being unable to leave, all was moving in the right direction.

The thousands sat in meditation as the Spiritual Qi congealed into streams entering their bodies one after another, a magnificent sight.

Though many in number, they were silent as grave; even those who rose did so with muffled steps, afraid to disturb others.

In a corner, An Ling’er, who had been meditating with her eyes closed, suddenly sensed an unusual aura in the Sacred Tomb; she frowned in puzzlement, then joyfully opened her eyes, leapt up, and looked around.

Because she had once received instruction in the Nine Heavens Divine Technique from Yang Kai, An Ling’er knew his aura better than anyone.

In that instant she distinctly felt Yang Kai’s presence nearby.

“Ling’er, what is it?” Yu Ying also opened her eyes and asked softly.

“He’s come in!” An Ling’er’s beautiful eyes darted about and she answered in a trembling voice.

“Who?” Yu Ying asked, then suddenly realized and covered her mouth, exclaiming, “You mean…”

An Ling’er nodded emphatically.

Their exchange alerted the other elders. Xu Hui and the others hurriedly opened their eyes and scanned the area.

After a moment, everyone’s gaze fixed in the same direction.

In that direction, a figure was approaching; the light was dim and his features could not be clearly seen, but every elder felt the stirring, hopeful signs of life emanating from him.

“Saint Lord?” Xu Hui shakily rose and called toward him.

“Is it truly the Saint Lord?” Cheng Yuetong blinked, her eyes unwavering as she stared that way.

Moments later, the man arrived before them, smiling as he looked at them—the longed-for face they had awaited for years.

“It is truly the Saint Lord!” Xu Hui cried, his voice hoarse as he and the other elders hastily bowed and greeted, “Your servants pay respects to the Saint Lord!”

“No need for such formality.” Yang Kai chuckled.

“You finally came!” An Ling’er looked at Yang Kai with a soft voice. “We waited here for so many years…”

Tears pricked her eyes as she spoke; during those days of waiting, many had resigned themselves to the belief they would be confined here for life—if not for Xu Hui’s timely comfort, things might have turned ugly.

“I am late; forgive me for making you wait so long,” Yang Kai said with a grave expression and sincere apology.

“The Saint Lord’s return—” Xu Hui’s eyes watered; he did not know what to say.

The disciples who had been meditating were awakened by the commotion; upon realizing Yang Kai had come, cheers erupted in waves that nearly rocked the Sacred Tomb.

Xu Hui hastened to quiet them.

Still, everyone looked on with eager eyes, wondering if Yang Kai would take them out this time.

The elders wore expressions full of expectation.

Yu Ying asked, “Saint Lord, since you are here, does that mean the matters outside are settled?”

“Yes, everything is in order. The yao have withdrawn; it is time for you to go home.”

Hearing this, they were instantly thrilled and could not wait to leave the place and return to the Nine Peaks.

“I will open the exit; the elders should make arrangements,” Yang Kai said with a smile.

“Yes.” Xu Hui quickly nodded and went with the others to make the arrangements.

While they arranged things, Yang Kai opened the exit and, together with An Ling’er, went out first.

Outside the Sacred Tomb, disciple after disciple walked out in order and saw the sun again, their emotions soaring; many howled to the sky to vent their joy.

Standing guard outside, Yang Kai watched them emerge and pondered how best to explain the Ancient Demon Clan’s presence to Xu Hui and the others.

Though he now presided over the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, he worried whether Xu Hui and the others would object to housing a clan of demons here.

If they opposed, how should he handle it…

“Your strength seems to have grown again,” An Ling’er suddenly said. “What is your cultivation now?”

“Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm,” Yang Kai replied offhandedly.

An Ling’er covered her mouth, her beautiful eyes trembling as she looked at him.

She remembered that when she first met Yang Kai he had been at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm, adrift on the sea. Now, in only four or five short years, he had reached the Third Stage—spanning two Stages—and was pushing toward the Saint Realm.

In that instant, An Ling’er began to believe Yang Kai’s earlier boastful words.

Long ago he had said that even if he did not enter the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, give him thirty years and he would stand shoulder to shoulder with the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

At the time, An Ling’er had not believed him and thought his words presumptuous, but now she had no choice but to accept them.

At the rate he was progressing, he truly could achieve it.

Perhaps it would take even less than thirty years…
