## Chapter 13 — Just You Wait

This single statement caused an uproar. Countless eyes immediately turned toward Su Mu, filled with disbelief.

So that was it! Yang Kai suddenly understood. He had been guessing Su Mu’s intentions all along, considering only two possibilities: either for profit or for fame. Yet he had been completely wrong. Su Mu’s true motive was none other than beauty.

Yang Kai had also met He’s daughter. The young girl was fresh and lively; though not breathtakingly beautiful, she was a refined and delicate maiden, with clear brows and bright eyes, a graceful figure. At only fourteen, she was known as a little beauty in Wumei Town.

Who would have thought that such a young girl was the object of Su Mu’s fixation? This was the true reason why He’s Rice Shop had attracted such trouble.

“Do not spout nonsense!” Su Mu’s face flushed deeply as he tried to deny it.

But the man sneered coldly, “I am not speaking nonsense. Though my brother and I have questionable character and often resort to extortion, we would never stoop to poisoning rice to cut off someone’s livelihood. You must understand, all of you esteemed gentlemen here are like foster parents to us. To sever someone’s income is to cut off one’s own path to survival. Such a thing I would never do. All of this was orchestrated by this brat.”

His words were sincere, which made the crowd laugh.

Yang Kai asked at the right moment, “After the plan succeeds, how much did he promise you as a reward?”

“Fifty taels of silver!” the man replied.

“Fifty taels, quite a sum,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Owner He, after a moment’s thought, naturally understood the whole story. His eyes blazed with anger as he glared at Su Mu, disdain dripping from his voice, “You despicable scoundrel, to resort to such filthy tricks! My daughter would never look at you. Lingxiao Pavilion has truly produced a degenerate like you, sullying the noble reputation of our sect. A handsome face wasted on a character far beneath even young Brother Yang’s. Truly, a single grain of rice nurtures all kinds of people. I feel ashamed for your parents.”

The merchants also showered Su Mu with contempt and curses, utterly disgusted by his vile conduct.

Su Mu’s face shifted between blue and red. He knew that after today, if he ever returned to Wumei Town, he would have to cover his face.

And all this trouble stemmed from the man before him… his senior brother! If not for him, Su Mu would have surely won He’s favor today, allowing him to visit more often and get close to He’s daughter. Bearing the name of a chivalrous man, he would have had the advantage of proximity and might have even won the beauty’s heart.

But now, all of that was shattered. Not only had his plan failed, but his reputation was ruined.

In extreme shame and anger, Su Mu’s expression suddenly calmed. He looked coldly at Yang Kai and said, “Senior Brother, may I ask your name?”

“Guess,” Yang Kai winked at him.

Su Mu took a deep breath. “Even if you don’t tell me, I can guess your identity. You’ve been in the sect for over three years but have yet to break through the Body Tempering Realm. That means you are a Trial Disciple. There are only a handful of Trial Disciples in the entire Lingxiao Pavilion. Just you wait; I will settle this score with you properly.”

With that, he turned and strode outside. Su Mu was skilled enough that even if someone tried to block his path, he pushed them aside with ease, as if no one stood before him, and left with an air of indifference.

After Su Mu’s departure, the crowd remembered the two men who had been beaten to a pulp. But there was no sign of them anywhere; they had slipped away quietly during the confrontation between Yang Kai and Su Mu.

Thus ended this farce. Yang Kai’s sharp insight had exposed the ruse, earning the merchants’ endless praise, especially He’s deep gratitude.

The young shop assistant, not much older than Yang Kai, looked at him with admiration.

As the crowd gradually dispersed, the shopkeeper’s wife came over and grabbed Yang Kai’s hand, reluctant to let go, growing more fond of him with each glance.

He wore a worried expression. “Nephew Yang, today you offended Su Mu. There may be trouble for you within the sect in the days to come.”

After today’s events, He’s tone had become more familiar.

“I’m not afraid,” Yang Kai smiled slightly. “The sect has its own rules. Even if he bears a grudge, he cannot harm me.”

“Though you say that, you must still be cautious. If anything were to befall you because of today’s matter, your uncle would be deeply troubled.”

“I will be careful,” Yang Kai reassured him.

The He couple was grateful for Yang Kai’s help and insisted he stay for dinner. Yang Kai was about to agree, but the shopkeeper’s wife’s questions scared him off.

“Little Yang, are your parents still alive? Where does your family live? Have you married yet this year?”

Judging by her tone, the shopkeeper’s wife seemed eager to become his mother-in-law. Yang Kai evaded the questions and quickly made his escape.

When he left, he carried a large sack of white rice, far more than fifty taels of silver could buy. With this, he would not have to worry about food for a whole month.

Yang Kai had initially worried that Su Mu might ambush him on the road. After all, Su Mu appeared elegant but was petty and scheming, capable of deceitful attacks. Yet Su Mu did not appear before Yang Kai even after he returned to Lingxiao Pavilion.

Upon reflection, Su Mu’s restraint was reasonable. Although many disciples had died in internal challenges within Lingxiao Pavilion, the sect forbade unprovoked attacks among its members, especially outside the sect. If Su Mu dared to ambush him outside, and the matter was exposed, Su Mu himself would face grave consequences.

If Su Mu wanted to deal with him, it would only be through challenges. Whether he could discover Yang Kai’s true identity was no longer in doubt. Trial Disciples in Lingxiao Pavilion were few; even if Su Mu did not know him before, a simple inquiry would reveal his identity.

Yang Kai had not yet discerned Su Mu’s true strength, but he was certainly at the Body Tempering Realm, though the exact stage was unknown.

It seemed he must hurry to cultivate; otherwise, he would truly have no place left in Lingxiao Pavilion.

With these thoughts weighing on his mind, Yang Kai hurried back to his small room, rested briefly, and then began to cultivate.

At this hour, it was no longer possible to train the Body Tempering Chapter, but he could practice Lingxiao Pavilion’s foundational techniques. These basics were external martial arts used to temper the body, consuming physical strength through external moves to refine the body.

For example, the Long Fist and Whip Kick techniques Yang Kai had displayed during a previous challenge were such foundational skills. Long Fist and Whip Kick were not considered true martial arts but rather basics. Every sect and clan had such foundational techniques.

On the left side of Yang Kai’s small room was a patch of open ground, where a wooden dummy stood about a person’s height. He had made it himself from a century-old locust tree, a hard and sturdy material perfect for training. The dummy bore many dents and faint bloodstains—marks left by Yang Kai’s daily practice.

Taking his stance, Yang Kai began striking the wooden dummy with a series of rapid blows. Each punch was delivered with full force, each kick as swift as the wind. The dummy shook violently, echoing with the sound of pounding wood.

Yet after only a short while, Yang Kai sensed something unusual.

His fists and kicks seemed far stronger than before. The dummy’s violent swaying and the muffled sounds it emitted were clear evidence. Moreover, as time passed, a warm, tingling sensation arose beneath his flesh and over his bones. It was unmistakably the feeling of his meridians opening, the qi sense born that morning growing clearer and stirring vigorously within his body.

Upon reaching the fourth stage of Body Tempering, the emergence of qi sense means the meridians can be refined. This warm tingling is the sign of meridians being expanded.
