## Chapter 2124 — The Mortal World

The old man asked a question, but the disciples of Qingyang Shrine were at a loss for how to answer.

The chubby Junior Brother and the blue-faced Senior Brother had already fainted and had not seen the expert’s projection. Deacon Tao still muttered to himself in a daze, while the remaining two First Stage Dao Origin Realm disciples could not explain anything.

“Are you all mute?” The elderly man snorted coldly, displeasure written on his face.

“Tao Ming, what are you doing?” Nearby, a middle-aged man at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm frowned and barked at Deacon Tao.

The shout struck Deacon Tao like a hammer to the chest and jolted him. He spat out a mouthful of blood; the shock pulled his scattered gaze back and his panic subsided.

He looked around in confusion. When he saw the elderly man and the others, his body trembled and he cried out, “This subordinate greets the Hall Master and all the Elders and Protectors!”

“Enough nonsense!” The middle-aged man who had awakened Tao Ming with a soul secret technique barked, “Tell me, what exactly happened here, and who came by?”

“Who came by…” Tao Ming muttered, and the terrifying scene from earlier flashed through his mind. He remembered the token turning to dust between his fingers, and his face went pale with fright. He dropped to his knees, trembling, “Please spare me, sirs! I didn't do it on purpose!”

The elderly man shook his head slowly at this.

"Let me do it!" A girl who looked only seventeen or eighteen suddenly spoke up.

Though she appeared young, she was a genuine Emperor Realm expert. No one knew what mysterious power she used, but her body floated eerily in midair as she drifted to stand before Tao Ming.

Her expression was gentle as water. She reached out a slender jade hand and tapped Tao Ming’s head through the air, saying softly, “Don’t be afraid. Just tell us what you saw and heard.”

As soon as she spoke, Tao Ming's trembling and fear seemed soothed, and he calmed down.

His gaze grew a little vacant as he stared into the void and began, “Reporting to the sirs, here’s what happened…”

He didn’t embellish or exaggerate, but recounted everything that had happened in detail, exactly as it was.

Yang Kai watched, amazed; he knew the Emperor Realm expert who looked like a young girl must have used a soul secret technique—one that guided Tao Ming to speak truthfully without harming his soul.

When the story reached the part about the strange figure descending from the sky, the elderly man barked, “What did that person look like? Describe it clearly!”

Tao Ming said, "I couldn't see clearly. The person wore a wide bamboo hat that covered his face, and his clothes were very odd. He was clearly a man, but wore a gaudy long robe..."

The old man’s expression changed at this and he asked urgently, “And the token? What did it look like?”

Tao Ming described it truthfully.

The old man fell silent, not speaking for a long time.

The middle-aged man looked strangely at the elderly man and asked, “Deputy Hall Master Qiu, do you know who this person is?”

The others also looked at the old man, hoping he would give them an answer.

The old man didn’t answer, but instead looked at Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang.

Only now did anyone glance at Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang.

The two hurriedly cupped their fists in salute, not daring to be disrespectful.

The old man nodded lightly and asked, “Did you bring the token?”

Qin Chaoyang said, “Reporting to sir, the token was indeed brought by me.”

“Good!” the old man said, then added, “Come with me. This isn’t the place to talk!”

When he finished, the old man swept his sleeve and a gentle force wrapped around Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang, carrying them forward so they followed involuntarily.

The other Emperor Realm experts exchanged glances and followed after the old man as well.

After the others departed, Tao Ming slowly came back to himself; his body trembled, his eyes were full of terror, and his face was deathly pale.

"Deacon Tao!" the other two Dao Origin Realm disciples hurried over and watched him nervously.

"I'm fine!" Tao Ming waved his hand, still shaken. "Luckily Lady Chen Qian showed mercy, or I would have been ruined!"

But thinking of the crucial token turning to dust in his hands, Tao Ming was filled with unease, fearing the Sect's higher-ups would blame him.

…

On the main peak of Qingyang Shrine, atop Ten Thousand Saints Peak.

In front of the palace, Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang stood there, looking at each other.

There wasn't a single guard at the palace entrance. After bringing the two here, the elderly man left them outside and ignored them while the others went straight into the palace.

Inside, the palace was protected by many barriers and the doors remained tightly shut. With Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang's strength, they could not see inside at all.

Although neither was restrained, they did not dare act rashly and stood obediently.

“Brother Yang, do you think…” Qin Chaoyang spoke up nervously.

"No way!" Yang Kai interrupted, already knowing what Qin Chaoyang feared. He smiled calmly, "If they truly meant us harm, they would have acted long ago; we wouldn't have had any chance to resist. Bringing us here and leaving us outside suggests they need to discuss things among themselves first. From what I heard, many of them don't even know who the token's owner is."

“I still haven’t figured out who he is!” Qin Chaoyang said in frustration.

"It's normal not to know." Yang Kai smiled. "But an ordinary Third Stage Emperor wouldn't make Qingyang Shrine so wary. That person..."

“You mean…” Qin Chaoyang suddenly thought of a possibility and exclaimed, “One of the Ten Great Emperors?”

“Most likely!” Yang Kai nodded.

“Hiss…” Qin Chaoyang sucked in a breath, unable to believe he’d once come face to face with such a legendary figure.

…

Inside the palace, a man sat at the head seat, dressed in a purple robe. His expression was dignified and commanding, his aura as deep as the sea. This was the Hall Master of Qingyang Shrine, a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert—Wen Zishan.

The elderly man and the other Emperor Realm experts Yang Kai had seen before also entered the grand hall, each holding their breath and listening as the old man reported the information to Wen Zishan.

"The token, the gaudy-robed man..." Wen Zishan smiled. His smile wasn't conventionally attractive, but it had a strange charm; the palace seemed to brighten for a moment.

“Hall Master, did you think of something?” the elderly man asked.

“Old Qiu.” Wen Zishan showed none of the Hall Master’s usual formality. He addressed Deputy Hall Master Qiu Ran casually in front of everyone, making the old man’s forehead veins bulge, while the others struggled to hold back laughter.

Even the icy Gao Xueting’s lips curved into a faint smile.

"Since you already thought of it, why ask me..." Wen Zishan said, picking up a string of spirit fruits beside him and biting into them one after another, a contented look on his face.

“Hall Master!” Qiu Ran couldn’t help but bark.

“Alright, alright.” Wen Zishan replied indistinctly, putting down the half-eaten spirit fruits, clapping his hands, and standing up. “Who else in this world would carve their identity token with a beggar on one side and a jade maiden on the other? And who else would parade around in such tasteless clothes? There’s only one answer…”

Everyone in the hall held their breath, focusing on Wen Zishan.

In that moment, Wen Zishan’s aura changed dramatically. His gaze grew sharp as a sword, as if it could pierce the void. He said solemnly, “Wandering the mortal world, playing among men…”

“The Mortal Emperor!” Gao Xueting blurted out in a startled cry.

"Oh? Little Xueting is clever, you guessed it right." Wen Zishan glanced at Gao Xueting, his usual dignity giving way to a brilliant smile. "What reward do you want? Uncle can give you anything."

Gao Xueting’s lips twitched slightly. “Hall Master, please behave! I’m not that little girl anymore—I’m well past the age for rewards! Besides… I’m already over two hundred years old!”

"Two hundred... still very young." Wen Zishan smiled, a little disappointed. "I liked you better as a child. Now you're so cold..."

“Hmph!” Gao Xueting snorted, turning her head away with a look that said, “I can’t be bothered with you.”

“Hall Master, let’s get back to business!” Qiu Ran’s forehead veins bulged even more, clearly at his limit, his robes fluttering without wind.

“Alright, alright.” Wen Zishan replied, turning his face away and resuming his casual tone. “The Mortal Emperor is the most mysterious of the Ten Great Emperors. That old fellow is always coming and going, like a dragon whose head you see but not its tail.”

“Old fellow…”

All the Emperor Realm experts were stunned, their faces twitching.

The Ten Great Emperors—what kind of figures were they? Yet in their Hall Master’s mouth, one was just ‘old fellow’…

“Hall Master, is it alright to call him that? What if he hears…” a middle-aged man interjected in shock.

“Don’t mind that old fellow’s temper,” Wen Zishan said with a smile. “He’s actually quite agreeable. He wouldn’t get angry over something so trivial…”

He explained casually, then continued, “And his Mortal Token is rarely seen. Even among Emperor Realm experts, few know what it looks like. But… this Lord happens to know. The front is a picture of a jade maiden emerging from water, the back is a beggar asking for alms. And… the token’s material is nothing special, just something you can find anywhere.”
