## Chapter 2568 — Tomb of All Spirits

Cultivating in the mountains, Yang Kai lost all sense of time.

Yang Youwei had enough sense to stay away. Ever since Zhang Ruoxi sent him off that day, he hadn’t shown his face again. But Yang Kai wasn’t worried about any tricks—he now held Yang Youwei’s Soul Imprint in his hand, so Yang Youwei couldn’t escape his control. If he tried anything, it would be courting death.

Zhang Ruoxi hadn’t come by either, focusing on her cultivation next door. She now possessed the strength of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, having gained much in the Shattered Star Sea, even obtaining a complete Stellar Origin. She was currently fusing with the origin, comprehending Emperor Intent, and preparing to break through to the Emperor Realm.

After a month, the sound of knocking came again.

Yang Kai opened his eyes. With a wave of his hand, the door swung open.

Yang Youwei entered respectfully, cupped his fists, and said, “Sir, there’s news.”

Yang Kai’s spirit stirred. He stood up and barked, “Lead the way!”

The matter of the Third Disciple couldn’t be delayed. Only by resolving it could he search for Xiaoxiao with peace of mind. So, upon hearing Yang Youwei’s report, he didn’t want to waste a moment and prepared to set out immediately.

As he stepped outside, Zhang Ruoxi, having received Yang Kai’s message, hurried out as well. Their eyes met; Yang Kai gave a slight nod, and Zhang Ruoxi silently followed behind him.

A beam of light shot into the sky, leaving the mountain peak, circling once in midair, then speeding off in a certain direction.

On the way, Yang Youwei carefully recounted the findings.

Over the past month, the more than twenty surviving yao under his command had been searching for the Third Disciple’s whereabouts. Just half a day ago, a little yao suddenly made a discovery and quickly reported to Yang Youwei. But they didn’t dare startle the Third Disciple—she was far too cautious. Over the years, they’d found her trail several times, but never managed to catch her. So they kept their distance, quietly tracking her movements.

But truth be told, with the strength of Yang Youwei’s group of yao, even if they confronted the Third Disciple head-on, they wouldn’t be her match.

Yang Kai figured Yang Youwei had no idea the Third Disciple was already at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. Otherwise, a month ago, he wouldn’t have dared charge out so boldly.

According to the little yao’s report, the Third Disciple seemed to have been hiding under a river all this time. This discovery was pure chance—perhaps she’d been hiding too long and wanted some fresh air, but as soon as she left the river, her whereabouts were exposed.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh—having more people really did make things easier.

If he’d had to search for the Third Disciple himself, who knew how long it would have taken? Not killing Yang Youwei last time and instead subduing him turned out to be a wise decision.

The journey wasn’t far, but before Yang Kai and the others arrived, a yao came flying toward them from ahead.

Yang Youwei looked closely and quickly said, “One of ours.”

He stepped forward to meet the yao. The two exchanged a few words in low voices, and Yang Youwei’s expression changed. He turned back, looking at Yang Kai with some anxiety.

Seeing his odd expression, Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. He asked in a deep voice, “What’s happened?”

Yang Youwei replied with a bitter face, “We’ve been discovered.”

“The Third Disciple ran again?” Yang Kai’s face darkened. Last time, the Third Disciple ran and hid for a month. If she escaped again, he’d have to wait another month or more—he didn’t have that kind of time to waste here.

Yang Youwei looked troubled, as if unsure how to explain. “You could say she escaped, but… you could also say she didn’t get away.”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai stared at him coldly.

Yang Youwei opened his mouth, sighed, and said, “That woman entered the graveyard!”

“What graveyard?” Yang Kai frowned.

“The Tomb of All Spirits!” Yang Youwei’s face turned bitter. As he spoke those four words, his face went pale and his body trembled, as if deeply afraid.

Yang Kai, not knowing the details, said impatiently, “Since you know she went in there, why not keep following?”

Yang Youwei’s face changed drastically. He said in fear, “Sir, you may not know, but the Tomb of All Spirits is a place no one can enter. It’s the burial ground for all living beings in the Ancient Land—once you go in, you never come out.”

Yang Kai snorted coldly. “I don’t care. Tell your people to keep tracking her, or you’ll regret it!”

Yang Youwei cried out in alarm, “Sir, please let me explain what the Tomb of All Spirits really is. Once you understand, you’ll know I truly can’t do anything.”

Yang Kai stared at him coldly, realizing he wasn’t just trying to scare him. “Fine, let’s hear what you have to say.”

Yang Youwei forced a smile. “I wouldn’t dare lie. Sir, the Tomb of All Spirits is a formless place—the graveyard for all living beings in the Ancient Land.”

“What do you mean, formless place?”

Yang Youwei replied bitterly, “No one knows where it is. It can’t be found at all.”

Yang Kai snapped, “You just said the Third Disciple entered the Tomb of All Spirits, but now you say you don’t know where it is. Do you take me for a child to be fooled?”

Zhang Ruoxi also looked at him coldly, her expression unfriendly. Yang Youwei’s contradictory words made it hard not to be suspicious.

Yang Youwei was terrified, feeling the pressure on his Divine Soul. He knew if he didn’t explain clearly, he’d die today. He hurriedly said, “Sir, please calm down! Every living being in the Ancient Land knows of the Tomb of All Spirits. You can ask anyone and they’ll tell you. How could I dare deceive you?”

Yang Kai frowned, realizing he probably wasn’t joking. He gestured, “Go on!”

Yang Youwei breathed a sigh of relief, knowing he wouldn’t die just yet. He chose his words carefully: “The Tomb of All Spirits is elusive and can appear anywhere in the Ancient Land, without any pattern. Sometimes it appears for a day or two, sometimes for months. Each time, only one tomb gate appears. If you want to enter, you go through that gate. But over all these years, no one who’s gone in has ever come out. And… whenever the Tomb of All Spirits appears, any demonic beasts or ancient beings nearby who are about to die will enter it willingly to await death. That’s why it’s called the Tomb of All Spirits. Along with the Blood Gate, it’s one of the two forbidden lands of the Ancient Land.”

Now there was something called the Blood Gate involved? Yang Kai didn’t know what that was, but since it was a forbidden land, it must be extremely dangerous.

He had no interest in asking about the Blood Gate. He just said, “So, according to you, the Tomb of All Spirits is where the beings of the Ancient Land go to die?”

“You are wise, sir!” Yang Youwei bowed.

“Why did the Third Disciple go in there?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

Yang Youwei thought, ‘How should I know?’ But he didn’t dare complain, only replied bitterly, “I’m not sure, but since she went in… I fear her chances are slim. Even the most powerful Yao Kings who entered never returned alive.”

Having said all this, he could only hope this lord wouldn’t act rashly.

But Yang Kai only pondered for a moment before waving his hand. “Lead the way. Let’s go see this Tomb of All Spirits.”

So all his words were for nothing. Yang Youwei wailed inwardly, wanting to dissuade him, but when he met Yang Kai’s gaze, he could only obediently lead the way.

Before long, they landed in a wide valley. From the surrounding forest, several yao suddenly leapt out. Yang Kai recognized them—they were Yang Youwei’s subordinates he’d met before.

“Sir!” Several yao stepped forward and saluted.

Yang Youwei waved his hand, telling them to stand aside, then watched Yang Kai nervously.

Yang Kai also looked around the valley, trying to find where the Tomb of All Spirits was, but found nothing. He frowned, “Where’s the graveyard?”

Yang Youwei glanced at one of his men. That yao immediately pointed ahead. “It’s right up there.”

“Are you messing with me?” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Yang Youwei panicked. “I wouldn’t dare! The tomb gate is formless and invisible. Unless someone about to die enters, you won’t see any sign of it.”

“Really?” Yang Kai eyed Yang Youwei suspiciously. With his powerful Divine Sense, he sensed nothing at all, but Yang Youwei seemed so certain it was hard not to believe him.

“Sir, can’t you see it?” Zhang Ruoxi suddenly spoke up.

“See what?” Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

“There’s a gate of light over there—a gray-black gate of light!” Zhang Ruoxi pointed.

The yao all stared at Zhang Ruoxi in shock, their eyes wide with disbelief.

Yang Kai also focused his gaze, sweeping the area with his Divine Sense, but still found nothing. Frustrated, he said, “There’s nothing there.”

“How can that be? It’s clearly right there…” Zhang Ruoxi looked puzzled.

Yang Youwei looked timidly at Zhang Ruoxi and asked tentatively, “Miss, you can… see the tomb gate?”

“Yes.” Zhang Ruoxi didn’t understand why they were so surprised.

Yang Youwei’s expression became awkward. He glanced around; the other yao looked equally strange.

Yang Kai swept his cold gaze over them and snorted, “Didn’t you just say only those about to die can see the tomb gate? How do you explain this? Is Ruoxi about to die too?”

Zhang Ruoxi jumped, her brows arching as she glared at Yang Youwei.

This fiend was cursing her to die—he really was no good.

Yang Youwei wailed, “That’s what the old stories say! That’s why I said the Tomb of All Spirits is a formless place. I don’t know what’s going on today!” He turned and grabbed one of his men by the collar, demanding, “Are you sure there’s a tomb gate over there?”

The yao hurriedly replied, “Yes, yes! That woman disappeared right there. When she went in, the tomb gate flashed—we saw it clearly!”

Two other yao nodded repeatedly.

Only then did Yang Youwei let go, glancing uneasily at Yang Kai.

Thud, thud, thud…

At that moment, a series of deep, muffled sounds rang out, as if some enormous creature was approaching. From that direction came the sound of trees crashing down.

Yang Kai and the others turned to look. Dust billowed as a massive figure emerged from the forest, each step shaking the ground.

Above that massive figure, a number of yao soared anxiously through the air, shouting urgently as they flew. Their voices rang out in agitation, clearly desperate about something.
