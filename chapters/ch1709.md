## Chapter 1709 — That's So Despicable

About three thousand li from Ghost Isle, a ship several zhang long sailed slowly, weaving back and forth within an area as it searched for the precious Huntian Lotuses.

There were not many warriors on board, only about twenty or so; a few stood on the deck, their gazes drifting back and forth across the sea.

More of them sat in place with sullen expressions, their eyes dim and listless.

From time to time they exchanged looks, all of them revealing faces full of unwillingness and humiliation.

Among them were Pang Zhen of Xiaguang Island and Qian Mo of the Sea Race. Both were Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors, counted among the experts on Dark Star, yet after being cast onto Ghost Isle they found that everyone here was stronger than themselves.

This, of course, referred to physical bodies; on Ghost Isle the sole measure of strength was the toughness of one's body, and Pang Zhen and Qian Mo's Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivation counted for nothing here.

They had been stranded on Ghost Isle for more than a day or two; over that long stretch Pang Zhen and Qian Mo had already worked out the situation here.

A man with a sharp, monkey-like face and ugly features suddenly stepped up to Qian Mo. Folding his arms across his chest, one hand stroking his chin, he swept an appraising gaze up and down her alluring figure, lewd light flickering in his eyes as a low, obscene chuckle escaped his lips.

Qian Mo glanced up at him once; the pretty face of the young woman immediately clouded over.

"Miss Qian Mo, think carefully—if you submit to me, I will guarantee your safety and supply your needs; you can formally join Ghost Isle, no longer be sent on dangerous jobs, and even have a chance to obtain Huntian Pills. It's a damned good deal—once it's gone, it's gone. You should know others won't be as easy to deal with as me." The sharp-faced man spoke in a coaxing tone, his eyes shamelessly lingering on her full, firm breasts as he swallowed audibly.

Ghost Isle was a cursed place that few stumbled into by mistake; its population had always been small—only a few thousand people in all.

Women were even fewer, and beauties especially rare. Any beauty was an incredibly precious existence, even a scarce commodity that could be exchanged for large quantities of Huntian Pill.

Qian Mo was undoubtedly such a person.

The sharp-faced man had set his sights on Qian Mo. Taking advantage of his position, he tried to coerce and entice her—once he achieved his goal, whether to enjoy himself or to trade the prize for Huntian Pill, it would be a profitable transaction.

What enraged him was that no matter how he spoke, Qian Mo ignored his meaning.

She was, after all, one of the Commanders of the Sea God Palace. Even if a tiger had fallen to the flatlands, Qian Mo still wouldn’t take the sharp-faced man seriously. If they were outside, she could crush dozens like him with one hand.

So when faced with the sharp-faced man's proposition, Qian Mo's sole reply was a single word: "Get lost!"

"You..." The sharp-faced man flew into a rage, pointing a finger at Qian Mo and making a movement as if to strike—seemingly intending to slap her hard to vent his anger.

Clatter...

Nearly half the people on the ship rose to their feet at once, all staring at the sharp-faced man with cold eyes; each of them contained a restrained, vicious intent.

These people were all the Sea Hall and Sea God Palace warriors who had been stranded here last time. Now they had apparently put aside past grudges and fought together; so when they saw Qian Mo about to be punished, they all stood up at once, as if only waiting for the sharp-faced man to move so they could swarm him and tear him to pieces.

In the end the sharp-faced man did not deliver the slap. Although the Sea Hall and Sea God Palace people were not to be feared—if a fight broke out his side would surely win—Ming Yue, the island lord, had decreed that residents of Ghost Isle were not to slaughter one another; anyone who violated this order would be executed.

This was not because Ming Yue loved his people, nor because he was magnanimous; it was because Ghost Isle's population was too small.

The island's inhabitants were few to begin with; if they killed one another over trifles until there was no one left for the lord to command, the island lord would become a hollow ruler without anyone under him—what pleasure would that be?

On Ghost Isle, only the island lord himself and a handful of his trusted followers had the right to take lives; others, regardless of rank, had no authority to decide another's fate.

When Pang Zhen and Qian Mo first fell to Ghost Isle, they were not considered residents and thus were not covered by that protection; that was why the lanky leader could take the opportunity to kill a few people—partly to intimidate, partly for his own enjoyment.

Things were different now. Although most of the cultivators from Sea Hall and the Sea God Palace had yet to formally join Ghost Isle, their names were already on record. The sharp-faced man wouldn’t dare offend the Island Lord’s authority.

“Good, good, very good!” The sharp-faced man sneered repeatedly. “You’ve got guts, daring to cross me. I’ll make sure you regret it for the rest of your live. Little girl, you think you’re too good for me, huh? One day you’ll come begging for me to take you. I just hope by then you can still keep that untouchable attitude of yours, heh heh!”

At that moment a Ghost Isle warrior shouted from the ship: "Sir, a sea beaver beast has been spotted three li away—it’s charging toward us!"

"Is that so?" The sharp-faced man's eyes lit up; he turned to look and indeed saw a sea beast over ten zhang in length, horribly ferocious in appearance, pushing towering waves as it rushed closer.

A smug smile appeared at the corner of his mouth as he glanced at the warriors who had opposed him earlier and drawled, "When searching for Huntian Lotus, the greatest danger comes from these various sea beasts. You newcomers haven't been on Ghost Isle long—this is your chance to temper yourselves. Except for Qian Mo, everyone face the enemy. I hope you won't disappoint me!"

At his words the faces of the dozen or so Sea Hall and Sea God Palace warriors changed dramatically.

Outside they would not have taken that sea beaver beast seriously—any one of them could have slain it with a casual motion—but on Ghost Isle, even if bound together, they might not be the beast's equal.

It was their first time going to sea, their first time participating in Huntian Lotus collection; having never taken the Huntian Pill to temper their bodies, they stood no chance against the sea beaver beast.

The sharp-faced man was clearly exacting revenge in plain sight, and doing so without violating the island lord's decree.

"What, are your ears deaf? My words not good enough?" he gloated at Pang Zhen and the others, pleasure welling in his heart. Then his face went cold and he barked, "Throw them all overboard! If they don't go through a few battles with sea beasts they will never know how precious the Huntian Lotuses are!"

His underlings responded with a roar, each grinning as they lunged toward different victims.

Pang Zhen and the others fought back with all their strength, but they were no match.

The Ghost Isle residents, though lower in cultivation than Pang Zhen and the others, had to some extent taken Huntian Pills to temper their bodies, and their physiques were generally formidable.

In a few swift moves Pang Zhen and the others were beaten black and blue and thrown into the sea.

The sea beaver beast charging toward them grew all the more excited; its speed suddenly surged, heading straight for the fallen as if it intended to swallow them whole.

"Wench!" The sharp-faced man stood on the ship, watching Pang Zhen and the others struggle with relish. He glanced sideways at Qian Mo and sneered, "If they die, it's your fault, heh heh. If you'd given in to me earlier this wouldn't have happened. But... it's not too late. Kneel and beg me to take you, and I'll pull them back up. A measly sea beaver beast is no match for me!"

Qian Mo's expression was full of grief and fury; she clenched her silver teeth and glared at the sharp-faced man with murderous intent.

Pang Zhen had little acquaintance with her. Although after being stranded the Sea Hall and Sea God Palace warriors had put aside grievances and fought together, Qian Mo was not so noble as to abase herself for Pang Zhen's life.

Yet among those who had fallen into the water were people from the Sea God Palace—her kin. She could not stand idly by.

"Despicable!" Qian Mo spat in fury.

The sharp-faced man felt no shame and laughed loudly. "So I’m despicable—what of it? Do you think this is still the Sea God Palace? You think you're still a leader of Sea God Palace? Tsk tsk... back when I was out there, I treated you Sea God Palace people with great respect; when I saw you, I would go out of my way to avoid you. I never thought I'd see such a day—proud leaders of Sea God Palace begging me on their knees. Blissful, blissful!"

Qian Mo's body trembled; her nails dug into her palm until blood welled, crimson running down her pale wrist and dripping onto the deck—yet she seemed not to notice.

"You don't have much time to think. Hesitate and they'll all die!" The sharp-faced man pointed forward.

Qian Mo turned to look and saw the enormous sea beast was less than fifty zhang from Pang Zhen and the others. Though those who had fallen into the water scattered, none could outrun the sea beaver beast; if the sharp-faced man did not intervene, their end would be to be swallowed one by one.

A look of despair washed over Qian Mo's face.

"Kneel!" the sharp-faced man roared, pressing the advantage. He could see Qian Mo waver; now was the perfect moment to crush her—perhaps he could finally force her to give in.

The other Ghost Isle residents stood aside to watch the show, each of them brimming with envy.

A Commander of the Sea God Palace—what a lofty status that once was. Before, they could only look up to her in awe, but now they could insult and humiliate her at will. The reversal filled them with a perverse thrill.

Especially when it came to such a voluptuous beauty—just imagining her kneeling on the ground, desperately begging, made the group feel that dying right then and there would be worth it.

Qian Mo's knees trembled as if about to give way, but she straightened and grit her teeth, shouting, "In your dreams!"

The smile on the sharp-faced man's face stiffened; his expectation curdled into disappointment and then into fury.
