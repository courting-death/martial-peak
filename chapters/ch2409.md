## Chapter 2409 — Is the Wenqing Sect So Impressive?

Above the wilderness, Yang Kai and the others were aboard a multi-deck ship, flying at high speed.

On the ship, only Yang Kai, Liu Qianyun, and a few disciples from Ice Heart Valley remained. Ling Yinqin had already parted ways with the group when they returned inland. As she had said, she wished to take her husband’s ashes back to Heavenly Wolf Valley in the Eastern Territory, to lay him to rest in the place where he was born.

Naturally, Jiao Yi and the others went with Ling Yinqin.

As for Yang Kai and his group, they were heading to Ice Heart Valley. Fan Xin and a few Junior Sisters had long yearned for their Sect, and now that they had come to the Northern Territory, they naturally wanted to visit and take a look.

Ice Heart Valley was not close to the Ice Sea. Even though this multi-deck ship Secret Treasure was very fast, it would still take at least ten days, possibly up to half a month, to arrive. Fortunately, Bing Yun was considered the master of this place and was thoroughly familiar with the terrain of the Northern Territory. With her guidance, Yang Kai wasn’t worried about getting lost.

After flying like this for about three to five days, Yang Kai, who was meditating and resting in the cabin, suddenly heard a commotion from the deck. Startled, not knowing what had happened, he hurried to the deck.

At this moment, Fan Xin and the others were all standing on the deck, their gazes fixed in one direction.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

“Senior Brother Yang!” Fan Xin, seeing Yang Kai arrive, quickly pointed in that direction and said, “There are people fighting over there, and a whole group is ganging up on a single woman. It’s truly shameless.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately released his Divine Sense. Sure enough, a dozen or so li away, a group was besieging a woman. That woman’s cultivation was impressive, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and her Origin Qi was extremely powerful. The Secret Treasure in her hand was also of a very high grade, so even though she was alone, she wasn’t so easily subdued.

Among those besieging her, two were also at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. It was unclear what they were wary of, but they didn’t strike to kill, only kept up the siege. Judging by their posture, they wanted to wear her down and capture her alive once she was exhausted.

With just a glance, Yang Kai could tell this woman must be an elite disciple from some major Sect. Her strength was on par with people like Xia Sheng and Wuchang whom he knew—if it came to a life-and-death battle, they would be evenly matched.

The top Sects of the Southern Territory produced rising stars like Xia Sheng and Wuchang. Naturally, the Northern Territory wouldn’t be much inferior. This woman was the best example.

Yang Kai guessed that the group besieging her probably recognized her, which was why they were hesitant to kill and only wanted to capture her alive.

The thought crossed his mind. Yang Kai said indifferently, “In the Star Realm, things like this happen every day. Why bother meddling?”

Although a group bullying a lone woman was indeed a bit disgraceful, such things were all too common in the Star Realm. Yang Kai had no interest in interfering. Besides, he felt that with her strength, if she truly fought to escape, this group might not be able to stop her. She was only trapped now because she hadn’t gone all out.

“But Senior Brother Yang…” Fan Xin looked anxiously at Yang Kai. “That woman is using Ice Heart Valley’s secret arts and techniques. She might be one of our Senior Sisters!”

“From Ice Heart Valley?” Yang Kai raised his brows in surprise. “Are you sure?”

Fan Xin hurriedly said, “Of course! We’ve always cultivated the arts and secret techniques passed down by our Master. We wouldn’t be mistaken. Now that this Senior Sister is in trouble, we can’t just stand by and do nothing.”

Yang Kai observed the woman more closely and found that she was indeed using ice-based arts and secret techniques. The Secret Treasure in her hand unleashed a chilling power. It seemed Fan Xin was right—this woman was from Ice Heart Valley.

However… Ice Heart Valley was one of the top Sects in the Northern Territory. When their disciples traveled the Northern Territory, few dared provoke them. How did this woman end up in such trouble? And who were these people besieging her?

“Senior Brother…” Liu Qianyun also looked at Yang Kai with pleading eyes. She now counted as a disciple of Ice Heart Valley too. Seeing a fellow Senior Sister besieged by so many, she couldn’t bear it, but her own cultivation was too low. She could only pin her hopes on Yang Kai, hoping he would help.

“Alright, since she’s from Ice Heart Valley, we can’t just stand by.” Yang Kai nodded, formed a hand seal, and the multi-deck ship immediately changed direction, heading straight for the battlefield.

The dozen-li distance was covered in just a few breaths thanks to the multi-deck ship's speed.

The two sides fighting below noticed someone approaching and showed various expressions.

The woman’s brows knitted, looking somewhat worried, while the group of martial artists besieging her also looked displeased. However, both sides stopped fighting and looked up at the multi-deck ship.

Now that he was closer, Yang Kai saw that this female disciple of Ice Heart Valley was extremely beautiful. Her long hair floated like clouds, her willow brows were as light as mist, and her bright eyes sparkled. Perhaps due to the battle, her breathing was a bit hurried, her cheeks were flushed, and she looked stunning. Her skin was flawless, white as snow, putting even frost to shame.

Her entire aura was somewhat similar to Bing Yun’s—extremely pure. The slight sweat on her delicate nose only added to her beauty.

This woman was indeed from Ice Heart Valley.

Sensing an aura similar to Bing Yun’s, Yang Kai was immediately certain. Standing on the deck, he nodded slightly to her.

The woman frowned. Although she could sense Yang Kai’s goodwill, she didn’t know why he would help her. After all, the group besieging her was not to be trifled with, and most people wouldn’t dare make enemies of them.

“Wenqing Sect is handling business here! All unrelated people, get lost at once!” A middle-aged man at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm below impatiently waved his hand and shouted at Yang Kai.

Wenqing Sect? Yang Kai was taken aback.

Just a few days ago, when they returned to the Northern Territory, they ran into people from Taiqing Island, who said they were hunting a Blue Infant Beast as a congratulatory gift for the Wenqing Sect’s Young Sect Master’s big day. He hadn’t expected that the group they encountered now would actually be from the Wenqing Sect.

Bing Yun had said that the Wenqing Sect was also one of the top Sects in the Northern Territory. When she left, its strength was on par with Ice Heart Valley, so their disciples had always been arrogant when traveling the Northern Territory. Seeing them now, Yang Kai realized Bing Yun hadn’t exaggerated.

These Wenqing Sect people didn’t even bother to ask who they were dealing with before swaggering over so aggressively—it was clear they didn’t take Yang Kai’s group seriously at all.

Perhaps in their view, just mentioning the Wenqing Sect’s name was enough to make others obediently back off.

Yang Kai originally had no particular feelings about the Wenqing Sect, but hearing the man’s tone, and remembering how they ganged up on the Ice Heart Valley disciple, his impression of the Wenqing Sect immediately soured.

“Is the Wenqing Sect so impressive?” Fan Xin, indignant at her Senior Sister’s plight, snapped angrily, “Five or six grown men bullying a single woman—have you no shame?”

“You wretched girl, you’re courting death!” The middle-aged man was furious, murderous intent surging as he glared at Fan Xin. As he spoke, a surge of pure Divine Soul power blasted toward Fan Xin, clearly wanting to teach her a lesson.

Among the Wenqing Sect disciples in the Northern Territory, few dared provoke them. As for the people on this multi-deck ship—who knew where they'd popped up from—daring to meddle here, they were truly ignorant of death.

On the ship, only Yang Kai, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, caught his eye. The rest had uneven cultivation, so he naturally assumed they were disciples of some mid-tier force.

As the Divine Soul power struck, a suffocating pressure swept over Fan Xin. Her face turned pale, her breathing quickened, and she felt as if an invisible sword was stabbing at her, leaving her unable to dodge. Terrified, her heart sank, her whole body went cold, and her hands and feet turned icy.

At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly pulled her behind him, then unleashed his own Divine Soul power to meet the attack head-on.

In the silent clash, Yang Kai didn’t budge, but the arrogant middle-aged man staggered back several steps, his face turning pale as he coughed up blood.

With just that exchange, his Divine Soul was wounded, showing the vast gap between his and Yang Kai’s Divine Soul power.

“Deacon Dong!” The Wenqing Sect members were shocked and hurried to gather around the middle-aged man.

The man seemed seriously injured, unable even to speak. He just waved his hand weakly, then quickly took out a Pill from his Spatial Ring and swallowed it.

“Brat, you dare ambush Dong Shan? Die!” Another Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator roared in anger. As he shouted, he suddenly summoned a ghost-headed broadsword, leaped into the air like an eagle, and slashed down at Yang Kai.

He thought Dong Shan was injured because he was caught off guard. Relying on his slightly superior strength, he intended to kill Yang Kai outright and wash away the humiliation.

The power of this strike shattered the very sky.

Even those standing behind Yang Kai—Fan Xin, Liu Qianyun, and the others—turned pale as a wave of deathly aura washed over them.

Yang Kai stood unmoving on the deck. Only when the broadsword was about to strike did he suddenly attack, both fists punching out. In an instant, a barrage of fist shadows filled the space ahead.

The blade light enveloping the area instantly collapsed, like a shattered mirror, utterly powerless.

“What?” The Wenqing Sect martial artist’s face changed dramatically. Sensing the terrifying power coming at him, he quickly turned his blade to defend himself, activated his Origin Qi, and tried to retreat.

But it was already too late.

Boom, boom, boom…

After several muffled thuds, the man was sent flying backward, landing heavily on the ground, blood spurting from his mouth.

“Deacon Cao Yang!” The remaining Wenqing Sect martial artists were shocked and rushed to check on Cao Yang’s injuries.
