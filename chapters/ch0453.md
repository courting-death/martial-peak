## Chapter 453 — Mystery-Grade Lower-Level, Hunyuan Pill

The succession war was a battle of connections and foundations, not a mere duel among the Yang Family’s descendants. Throughout this process, some gathered less support, while others amassed more.

With the involvement of the Yang Family’s Blood Servants, the notion of fairness did not even exist.

The succession war itself was survival of the fittest!

“There’s one more thing I need to tell you.” Qiu Yimeng hesitated, brow furrowing deeply, her dark eyebrows shadowed with worry — clearly something displeasing had occurred.

“Speak.”

“It’s about the alchemists from Yao Wang Valley. Yang Zhao, along with several of your other elder brothers, jointly petitioned the Yang Family Elder Hall to protest and request the disqualification of those alchemists’ participation, especially Qin Ze.”

“Childish!” Yang Kai’s expression was indifferent, showing not the slightest concern.

Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly, “Though I think the Elder Hall of your Yang Family would not risk offending Yao Wang Valley by agreeing to Yang Zhao’s request, given the true purpose of the succession war, this matter must still be taken seriously. What if the Elders rashly approve it?”

“Impossible.” Yang Kai shook his head confidently, “The succession war hinges on relationships. I am well acquainted with the people of Yao Wang Valley, which is also pleasing to the Elder Hall. How could they intervene?”

“That reasoning holds, but Yang Zhao is clever; he wouldn’t make such a pointless move unless he had other intentions. You should keep an eye out.”

“His intention...” Yang Kai frowned and nodded slightly.

“Alright. You’ve been away for a few days, and these are roughly the two big matters. Also, Qin Ze and his group have been clamoring for materials for alchemy. What do you think...?”

“Has the alchemy room been designated?”

“It has. They’ve also added many alchemy tools. However, the people from Yao Wang Valley have their own pill furnaces. Those tools probably won’t be used.”

Yang Kai nodded. “Then I’ll go deliver the materials to them. You get back to your work.”

Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly and brushed past Yang Kai. Liu Feisheng subtly nodded in agreement, tailing after her.

“Master Kai, the young Master of Tianyuan City seems to have taken a liking to Qiu Yimeng. Ever since arrival, he’s been clinging to her like a shadow.” Huo Xingchen chuckled, “Don’t you feel anything? ”

“If Qiu Yimeng were anyone’s to conquer, she wouldn’t be Qiu Yimeng.” Yang Kai shook his head lightly. “Why bring this up?”

“I don’t know why, but I don’t like Liu Feisheng!” Huo Xingchen curled his lips, “That guy is even more handsome than this young master — it’s unfair. Enough of this, I’m off to cultivate. Won’t bother you.”

Hearing that, Yang Kai looked at him in surprise, as if never expecting this indulgent young master to be so diligent.

Likely, the pressure felt at Yang Kai’s manor from the numerous leading young figures from various factions passing through has made Huo Xingchen curb his former reckless ways so as not to fall behind.

Entering the alchemy room, Yang Kai took out all the alchemy materials.

Qin Ze and the others saw the room filled with materials, their faces beaming with anticipation and impatience.

“Senior Brother Qin, we’ll be relying on all of you here.”

“Not tiring at all,” Qin Ze smiled broadly. “To learn the Way of Alchemy beside Senior Aunt Xia is no hardship.”

Xia Ningshang was now a top alchemist who could rival Xiao Fusheng. Qin Ze’s group rarely saw Xiao Fusheng let alone observed his alchemy; now having the opportunity to refine pills alongside Xia Ningshang, they were eagerly enthusiastic.

“Senior Sister won’t exit seclusion for another day or two. You all get familiar with things here first.” Yang Kai’s expression was odd — these terms of address had thoroughly become jumbled. Qin Ze called Xia Ningshang Senior Aunt, while Yang Kai referred to Qin Ze as Senior Brother — everyone just accounted for their own.

“Junior Brother Yang, you are busy with noble affairs; no need to entertain us.” Qin Ze spoke casually, already beginning to examine the warehouse full of alchemy materials with those from Yao Wang Valley.

No one else paid attention to Yang Kai anymore.

Chuckling softly, Yang Kai quietly withdrew.

Sure enough, Xia Ningshang emerged from seclusion two days later, having fully digested the True Alchemy Formula Yang Kai had imparted, immediately immersing herself in alchemical work.

Countless eyes watched the alchemy room’s activity within the manor. Aside from Yao Wang Valley, a total of eleven factions had gathered forces to assist Yang Kai in the succession war. Naturally, Yang Kai felt responsible to equip and strengthen them by his means to meet the increasingly fierce struggle.

If pills were to be produced, they would be used for cultivation, so every faction eagerly awaited the quality and quantity of the first batch of pills from the alchemy room, and how many could be distributed as finished products.

Yang Kai’s manor was peaceful, and the entire war city quiet. After two Yang Family scions were eliminated, the succession war seemed to have fallen into a calm.

Every young master ramped up efforts to gather followers. Alchemists and refining masters were especially in short supply. Materials on the market became rarer and more expensive, even spreading to Zhongdu.

During this time, Pang Chi and Mu Nandou of the Bamboo Segment Gang secretly gathered many supplies and delivered them to Yang Kai’s manor at night, luckily undetected.

But that was only once; the next time they entered the war city, interception seemed inevitable.

The command flag Yang Kai held had also been traded with the family for materials, all poured into the alchemy room.

Still, Yang Kai felt anxious. The other major support he expected had yet to appear, and he was unsure what troubles had occurred.

Under intense scrutiny, half a month later, the first batch of pills finally came off the production line!

Upon receiving the news, the leading young figures of major factions gathered in the main hall, all looking at Yang Kai with exhilaration and anticipation.

Eleven factions, not one missing. Except the Duanmu Family, all were handsome youths and beautiful maidens, dazzling to behold.

This was truly a stage for the young!

“Master Kai, will the Huo Family have any share of these pills?” Huo Xingchen smiled and asked, “If not enough, it’s fine, let others prioritize. Our Huo Family men aren’t in a rush!”

“Do you truly think so?” Qiu Yimeng smiled at him playfully.

“Would I lie?” Huo Xingchen’s expression turned serious. “Our Huo Family is one of the Eight Great Families. What pill have we not had? It’s just that right now we can’t get any from the old master.”

“Everyone has traveled far, so let them go first. The Dong Family can wait as well.” Dong Qinghan smiled and stepped back gracefully. He shared Huo Xingchen’s sentiments. After only half a month, even with Yao Wang Valley’s skilled alchemists and ample materials, they probably couldn’t produce many pills. There was no way to satisfy everyone’s demands.

The Dong Family was Yang Kai’s maternal family; naturally, Yang Kai wouldn’t treat them unfairly. Deferring a little this time was no issue.

No sooner had Dong’s words ended than a chorus of polite refusals arose in the hall. The young leaders from the factions each offered to delay their own claims in favor of others.

This harmonious atmosphere pleased Qiu Yimeng.

After all these days together, she could see that the people gathered at Yang Kai’s manor were not those who liked to squabble or fight. Their usual interactions were warm and cordial; occasional conflicts among their followers were quickly resolved, clearly not wishing to trouble Yang Kai.

Such small details highlighted the weight Yang Kai held in their hearts! Without his significant standing, they would not show such humility.

All of this was because Yang Kai stood among them.

“Enough with the chatter.” Qiu Yimeng smiled gently. “Do you think, if there weren’t enough pills, that Yang Kai would have summoned you all here? It’s because he has accumulated enough to share that he called everyone.”

Those below could not help but raise their eyebrows hearing this.

Xiang Tianxiao nodded quietly, murmuring, “As expected from Yao Wang Valley’s alchemists; their speed in pill making is truly extraordinary.”

From the left, Zuo Fang laughed heartily. “I, Zuo, am fortunate to use pills refined by Yao Wang Valley disciples. Truly thanks to Brother Yang.”

Everyone beamed, suddenly confident that joining Yang Kai’s faction was a wise choice. No matter the rest, with such pills supplied in the future, their strength would steadily improve.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, saying little.

The first batch of pills was not made by Yao Wang Valley’s people, but entirely refined by Xia Ningshang. Yao Wang Valley’s disciples were still learning the alchemical arts from her and would likely only begin production in a few days.

It wasn’t that their techniques were unsophisticated, but Xia Ningshang’s skill was truly miraculous. Even with study, they would need time to assimilate comparable experience.

“Qiu Yimeng, distribute the pills.” Yang Kai instructed.

She clapped her hands, and immediately, people from Autumn Rain Hall entered carrying trays. Each tray held two bottles of pills with unknown names.

“Generous indeed — two bottles for each family?” Huo Xingchen was stunned. He had expected that one bottle each would be excellent given the short time, yet the actual amount was double.

However, more quantity likely meant the pills’ grade was not high.

They must be Heaven-Grade pills, he secretly guessed.

Everyone took the pills with joy. Though internally they suspected these were Heaven-Grade, no one felt disappointed.

Heaven-Grade was already impressive, especially needing to supply so many people.

“These are specially made for cultivation — Hunyuan Pills.” Pausing briefly, Qiu Yimeng smiled and added, “Mystery-Grade Lower-Level, Hunyuan Pills!”
