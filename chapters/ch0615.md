## Chapter 615 — Scarlet Blood True Orchid

In the midst of the swamp, Shui Ling did not care in the slightest about her current bedraggled appearance; she danced and gestured about, ecstatic.

As if infected by her joy, Yang Kai’s mood also gradually brightened.

Relaxing, Yang Kai suddenly felt something amiss, for his body sensed an unprecedented lightness, as if a shackle that had long bound him had abruptly vanished.

The True Yang Technique’s circulation sped up another degree; his qi fluttered, and his meridians and flesh all rejoiced.

“Shui Ling…” Yang Kai frowned and called her name.

“What is it?” Shui Ling stopped dancing and looked at him with curiosity.

“I’m about to break through.”

Shui Ling covered her small mouth in surprise and exclaimed, “Now?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai said, then sat cross-legged.

Shui Ling thought for a moment and then clapped her hands, saying, “Right — there was a layer of constraint in your world that shackled cultivators’ development. After coming to the Tongxuan Continent that constraint disappeared, which likely created the opportunity for your breakthrough. But to break through here…”

It was somewhat inappropriate. The two of them had only just arrived; they did not even know where this place was, nor whether dangerous people or powerful Demonic Beasts lurked nearby. If someone disturbed him during his breakthrough, it would not be a trifling matter.

“Can you hold it back?” Shui Ling suggested.

Yang Kai forced his eyes open, gave her a look, then closed them again and calmed himself.

“Forget I said anything.” Shui Ling smiled wryly; breakthroughs could not be forced at will.

Reluctantly, Shui Ling released her Divine Sense to probe the vicinity, checking for any potential danger.

After searching, there was nothing unusual within ten li, and Shui Ling finally relaxed and waited in silence, planning to observe the surroundings while Yang Kai broke through to determine their location.

A little over ten li away from where Yang Kai and Shui Ling sat, a small group lay hidden behind a patch of grass.

There were only seven or eight of them, all cultivators of the Divine Roaming Realm; the leader was a striking woman whose scant attire made her look like a ripe honey peach, full and voluptuous, bright-eyed and fair-toothed, clad in a pale blue gown split at the hem to reveal long, fair legs.

Such an outfit made movement easy, but in her motions the loveliness between her thighs was faintly visible.

The enticing sight left the men around her parched of speech. The men hiding behind her stared hungrily at the exposed white skin and the rounded firmness of her hips; her seductive posture fired their blood and stirred uncontrollable desire.

Yet because of the woman’s status, the men only dared to gaze secretly and did not act on any unscrupulous thoughts.

The alluringly dressed woman seemed to relish the glances cast at her; rather than being bashful, she bore a composed smile.

“Your breathing is too heavy; tone it down, or you’ll scare the thing off and I’ll have you to answer for it,” she suddenly warned lightly.

Her followers were embarrassed and nodded hurriedly, no longer daring to ogle her figure.

“You all know what our target is this time, yes?” the scantily clad woman asked in a low voice.

The men nodded in unison.

“Good.” She nodded in satisfaction and continued, “The Scarlet Blood True Orchid is a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Plant and has its own consciousness; do not underestimate it. From what I learned, this specimen has already produced seven leaves — that marks it as a thousand-year medicinal Spiritual Object of great value. If we can get it, the rewards will be substantial.”

One big, thick-bearded man chuckled, “Miss, if this succeeds, what reward will we receive?”

“Twenty crystal stones each,” the woman answered.

At that, every man’s breathing grew heavy; twenty crystal stones was a sizeable fortune to them.

In an instant, everyone’s fighting spirit rose; their eyes no longer lingered on the beautiful woman but fixed intently, holding their breath for the appearance of the Scarlet Blood True Orchid.

“Soon.” The woman murmured, “it comes up each month to draw sunlight. Today happens to be its day to emerge; you won’t wait long before getting your wish.”

“Rest assured, Miss, the seals and traps we set will be enough to capture it. If it dares appear, it won’t escape,” the bearded man said confidently with a chuckle.

“Excellent.” She inhaled lightly, her garment parting to reveal more, drawing the eye. “The Young Master of Langya Fudi is injured and urgently needs this Scarlet Blood True Orchid to heal. You should know that if our Duao Meng can build good relations with Langya Fudi, the benefits will be great.”

Everyone nodded seriously.

The Duao Meng was fairly powerful, but the alliance lacked high-level talents, so other forces did not take them seriously. Langya Fudi was a famed great force; earning its favor would greatly benefit Duao Meng’s development.

“It’s come out!” Someone nearby whispered.

Everyone’s spirits jolted and they looked in that direction.

In the swamp, the murky water began to shimmer a faint red; as time passed and their impatience grew, that red glow brightened and became clearer.

Gradually, a strange orchid with seven red leaves, its whole body like blood with distinct veins, rose out of the swamp.

Every person’s breath shortened as they stared at this thousand-year Scarlet Blood True Orchid.

All of them felt their hearts thumping, yet they forced themselves to suppress it.

After some time, the Scarlet Blood True Orchid finally revealed its full form.

Though a plant, it was a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object, possessed of consciousness and perception of danger, and could act to avoid threats.

“Miss…” the bearded man could no longer restrain his twitching desire and whispered.

“Wait!” the woman said in a deep voice, “it’s cunning — this showing is merely a test.”

Sure enough, no sooner had she finished speaking than the Scarlet Blood True Orchid suddenly sank back into the swamp and vanished.

Time passed and it showed no sign of emerging again; suspicion rippled through the group, and they wondered whether their movements had been exposed, causing the plant to become wary.

Only the woman maintained a confident expression.

After nearly half an hour, the swamp once more glowed a ruddy red, and shortly thereafter the Scarlet Blood True Orchid reappeared.

This time it rose out of the swamp onto the nearby grass, planting roots there; its seven leaves fully unfurled, bathing in the blazing sun.

“Move!” the woman ordered in a low shout.

Now was the best moment to act, when the Scarlet Blood True Orchid was most relaxed.

At her command the bearded man’s hands moved quickly and subtle energies were unleashed to trigger the traps and seals they had prepared.

But before those traps could take effect, a strong energy fluctuation came from more than ten li away, and everyone’s faces changed at the wave of energy.

The woman did not hesitate; her delicate body became a streak of light as she shot out, heading straight for the Scarlet Blood True Orchid.

Still too late — sensing that fluctuation, the Scarlet Blood True Orchid had already retreated back into the swamp. The woman lunged and found only emptiness; her pretty face twisted as she stood stunned, rage boiling within.

The group trudged back, each wearing an expression of disappointment.

Twenty crystal stones had slipped through their fingers, and no one was in a good mood.

“How can there still be someone here?” she snarled, turning to the bearded man. “Didn’t you say you had driven away everyone within fifty li?”

To secure this Scarlet Blood True Orchid, Duao Meng had prepared for a month, declaring the fifty-li area a forbidden zone where no one could tread.

Before the operation they had checked their surroundings and indeed found no outsiders, yet now the energy fluctuation clearly came from someone’s breakthrough.

The bearded man’s mouth opened and he reddened, meekly saying, “We did drive away everyone within fifty li.”

“Then what is this situation now?” she snapped. “We promised Langya Fudi we would deliver the Scarlet Blood True Orchid in half a month. What am I supposed to deliver now?”

The bearded man was speechless and stammered, “We’ll try again…”

“Try?” she sneered, “The Scarlet Blood True Orchid has retreated beneath the swamp; after this fright it will not show itself for at least half a year. How will you try? Go find it yourself!”

The men were scolded severely and dared not retort; their faces flared.

The woman breathed heavily, clearly furious.

Victory had been within reach and now, with this abrupt turn of events, the fruits of success had slipped away, and she seethed with rage.

Standing still to compose herself, she then strode toward the direction from which the energy fluctuation had come and sneered, “Come with me. I want to see who ruined my plan!”

“If we find him I’ll kill him!” the bearded man blurted, expressing his anger.

The woman shot him a fierce glare that silenced him instantly.

Over ten li away, Yang Kai lightly clenched his fist, a trace of satisfaction appearing on his face.

He had reached the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage. Arriving in this world and losing the world’s restraints, he had instantly broken through a stage, and the Divine Sense energies absorbed into his Sea of Consciousness had been fully assimilated, bringing him many gains.

“Congratulations.” Shui Ling came over with a grin and offered her congratulations.
