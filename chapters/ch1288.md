## Chapter 1288 — Yin-Soul

A vast valley covering hundreds of thousands of li spread out below; Yang Kai and Yang Yan hung in midair, staring at the roiling mass beneath. Thick, unusually dense yin-cold qi emanated from it, causing both of them to frown.

Even without delving deeper, Yang Kai could tell these yin-cold qi were no easy thing to withstand, and from time to time a howling wind like the cries of ghosts and wolves drifted from within, sending chills down one’s spine.

"Are you sure this is the place?" Yang Kai asked after a moment’s observation, turning to Yang Yan.

"Yes, although I don’t know the exact spot," Yang Yan replied, looking over the two tattered maps in her hands, glancing left and right before speaking with certainty. "But if these two fragments are pieced together, the path they point to leads right here."

"That’s somewhat troublesome." Yang Kai frowned.

The reason he’d brought Yang Yan along this time was precisely because of those two map fragments—one was in Yang Yan’s possession to begin with, and Yang Kai hadn’t questioned where she’d acquired it. The other had once appeared at an auction in Tianyun City; Yang Kai had obtained it by killing a Quehe Sect disciple named Meng Hongliang in the Flowing Flame Sandland.

When the two fragments were joined together, although they still couldn’t provide a perfectly precise clue, they revealed enough to be of interest.

These maps, clearly ancient, must hide some secret. If they could find the place the fragments pointed to, they might gain tremendous benefit. With the Dragon Lair Mountain short on funds and Yang Kai forbidding Yang Yan from continuing to auction Secret Treasures, Yang Yan had seized the chance of the trip to Liuli Gate to accompany Yang Kai. She might as well see whether the fragments would lead to a stroke of luck that could solve their current dilemma.

After counting the Thousand Illusions Glaze consumed by the Stone Puppet, they hurried here without pause. It took them ten days to finally arrive above this immense valley. It was called a valley because at its edges mountain ranges connected, encircling it in a ring. Yang Kai had never before seen a valley of such enormous scale.

At first glance it seemed as if some mighty power had forcibly driven the earth inward, creating a depression, and the yin-cold qi seeping from within made one very uncomfortable. If the outskirts were like this, one could only imagine the dangers lurking deeper inside.

"Do you know what this place is?" Yang Kai asked again. If he were alone he wouldn’t be afraid of much, but with Yang Yan beside him—though she had excellent self-preservation—if any great danger arose and he couldn’t split his attention to save her, it would still be worrisome.

“I’m not sure. Dark Star is far too vast—how could I possibly know every place on it? But judging from how desolate it is for a million li around, it doesn’t seem to be any sort of good place,” Yang Yan said, shaking her head.

Yang Kai felt helpless; whether this was a bad place was obvious at a glance—did he really need Yang Yan to tell him?

It was also unlikely they could find anyone to ask now; after passing through a small town five or six days earlier they hadn’t seen another soul.

"We’re here already, so let’s go in and take a look. Whether the fragments will point to the final location is uncertain; I just don’t want to waste these two fragments," Yang Yan urged when she saw Yang Kai hesitating.

Yang Kai glanced at her and then said thoughtfully, "Fine! But you must stay close—do not stray more than three zhang from me."

"Got it!" Yang Yan stuck out her tongue, pulling her black robe tighter about her.

Without further hesitation they moved deeper toward the valley.

The moment they entered, the dense yin-cold qi assailed from all sides, and Yang Yan shivered. The next moment a scorching fire-type Saint Yuan burst forth within her, dispelling the yin-cold and restoring her to normal.

Yang Kai paid the cold no mind; his body was strong enough to resist such assaults.

The place was desolate—sparse, ugly black grass that radiated coldness, and trees were all but absent. The ghostly howling winds grew louder, sweeping from afar and passing over them with a strange chill that seemed to strike at the soul itself, hard to guard against.

"Move on!" Yang Kai called, leading Yang Yan deeper. Aside from the oppressive environment and the intermittent fierce winds, they encountered no other danger—an outcome that surprised Yang Kai, though he welcomed it.

A day later they had penetrated three thousand li and now stood before toppled remnants of walls, somewhat dazed.

There had evidently once been a building here, but it had long since collapsed; only traces remained. Time had worn the edges of the ruins smooth, and the scattered stones were polished like mirrors.

"Huh!" Yang Yan suddenly seemed to discover something; she darted forward several steps and hurried around a broken wall, circling a particular spot.

Yang Kai did not stop her. His Divine Sense scanned the surroundings and found no signs of danger.

After a while Yang Yan returned, looking thoughtful.

"Found something?"

"A sealing formation," Yang Yan said in a low voice. "This looks to be the remains of some sect. There are traces of sealing formations here, though they’ve been damaged. We’ll need to be cautious going forward—sect formations usually grow stronger from the outside inward. We hadn’t encountered them before, probably because we hadn’t yet entered this sect’s range."

Hearing this, Yang Kai nodded at once. "Which way now?"

Yang Yan examined the two fragments again and then pointed to a location. "This way!"

Yang Kai resumed leading. As they proceeded they indeed ran into lingering sealing formations and arrays, but to Yang Yan they were nothing. He avoided what he could at her direction; for those that couldn’t be avoided, Yang Yan stepped forward to dismantle them.

Not one of those formations could withstand thirty breaths under Yang Yan’s hands.

Yet Yang Kai showed no pleasure; his expression grew serious. Since this was a sect ruin and the formations still functioned after so many years, one could imagine how powerful this sect must once have been, and the internal arrangements would have been formidable.

Whenever Yang Yan dismantled a formation, Yang Kai stood guard. After she finished, he led the way again; their cooperation was seamless.

At one moment, after Yang Yan had broken a small illusionary seal, clapping in delight, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly chilled. In a blur he lunged before her, grabbing her shoulder with one hand and dragging her behind him, while his other hand pushed lightly forward.

A blob of scorching black flame burned in his palm.

His palm struck the void, and a shrill scream suddenly issued forth. The cry carried an incredible spiritual might, delivering an attack akin to a Soul Technique toward Yang Kai and Yang Yan’s Sea of Consciousness. The assault wasn’t strong enough to tear their defenses, however, and was repelled.

Even so, Yang Yan’s face drained of color—she had been taken by surprise and naturally was shaken.

When she focused and looked toward Yang Kai she saw a nearly imperceptible, ethereal figure held fast in his grasp. Demonic Flame rolled as the shadow’s blurred features contorted with pain before it was consumed by the demonic fire.

"Yin-Soul!" both Yang Kai and Yang Yan blurted out simultaneously, then exchanged looks that sent a chill down their spines.

Yin-Souls are peculiar entities—souls of the deceased that failed to disperse and instead condensed into another kind of quasi-life.

Ordinarily, when a living being dies, its soul doesn’t persist long; without a body as a carrier the soul quickly dissipates into the world and becomes part of the Spiritual Qi. But with the right Secret Treasure to preserve it, or if it quickly finds a suitable body to possess, the soul can be kept from fading.

Yet treasures capable of storing a soul are not easily forged, and possession is fraught with danger. One misstep can result in the possessor being devoured by the host’s soul—as when Di Mo once attempted to possess Yang Kai’s body and was in turn controlled by him, compelled to obey Yang Kai—a true case of losing both man and troops.

There is another circumstance that can prevent a soul’s dissolution: a fitting environment.

This valley is such a place; the prevailing yin-cold qi is so dense that a soul’s dispersal would slow greatly. If conditions are right, a soul may linger indefinitely and become a Yin-Soul.

Of course, upon becoming a Yin-Soul that wisp of soul loses its rational mind and turns into a ferocious specter driven only by instinct.

Yin-Souls formed under such conditions are highly aggressive; any living thing or creature with a body becomes their enemy. They exist between the material and the ethereal, and without proper secret techniques and treasures, truly eliminating them is very difficult.

Yang Kai’s Demonic Flame, once it took on scorching attributes, became supremely fierce and Yang in nature—exactly the nemesis of such Yin-Souls—so a mere grab was enough to kill it. Had it been another cultivator, the task would not have been so easy.
