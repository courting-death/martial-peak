## Chapter 61 — Returning a Favor

Why was Long Zaitian targeting him? Yang Kai glanced at Hu Mei’er, whose eyes were filled with apology and guilt, and a faint understanding stirred in his heart.

Some matters were better left unasked.

Hu Mei’er was a clever and perceptive woman. Though Yang Kai only gave her a brief look, she immediately grasped the meaning behind it.

“Long Grandpa forbids you from entering the mining area, and I cannot easily offend him. How about this: I’ll help you buy those few seeds. You wait here for me a moment,” Hu Mei’er said softly.

“Alright.” Yang Kai knew this was the only way. He took out all the valuable items he had on him and then told Hu Mei’er the names of the Blood Battle Gang disciples who had found the seeds. He had already inquired about them from the stall owner in the Black Wind Trade Market.

Hu Mei’er entered the underground mining area, while Yang Kai’s eyes swept over the few houses on the surface. Just now, Long Zaitian had entered one of those rooms, and Yang Kai could feel a pair of eyes watching him from inside.

Within the room stood two figures, old and young, both gazing toward Yang Kai by the window.

The elder was none other than Long Zaitian, who had just attacked Yang Kai. The younger looked about Yang Kai’s age and was Long Zaitian’s grandson, Long Hui.

Long Hui stared coldly at Yang Kai, dissatisfaction evident in his voice: “Grandpa, why didn’t you kill him just now?”

Long Zaitian snorted coldly. “Mei’er was protecting him. How could I kill him?”

“Then all the more reason to kill him. I’ve never seen Mei’er so devoted to any man before. This fellow’s relationship with Mei’er is not ordinary. Leaving him alive will only bring disaster.”

“Hm, indeed, I’ve never seen Mei’er protect anyone like this before. This time, she even defied me for his sake. It’s unusual,” Long Zaitian frowned.

Long Hui was filled with jealousy. “Mei’er has now entered the mining area. Grandpa, why don’t you strike again?”

Long Zaitian looked at Long Hui with a mixture of frustration and disappointment. “I can kill him easily, no problem. But if his death causes Mei’er to resent you, do you think it’s worth it?”

Long Hui hesitated, then shook his head. “Not worth it. But can we just let him continue to grow close to Mei’er? I can’t bear it.”

“You!” Long Zaitian sighed. “Learn from your older brother. See how he deals with the woman he likes. If you want Mei’er, you must put your heart into it. I can kill for you, but I cannot win a woman’s heart for you. Hu Man never bore a son, only these two daughters, Jiao’er and Mei’er. If you and your brother can win them both, then the Blood Battle Gang will be ours! Our Long family has served the Blood Battle Gang for three generations, decades of loyalty. It’s time we tasted the power of leadership!”

Long Hui’s blood burned with fervor. “It’s time for our Long family to take control. Grandpa, rest assured, Mei’er won’t escape, and my brother will surely win over Hu Jiao’er.”

“Good. It’s good to have ambition,” Long Zaitian nodded with a smile.

Long Hui looked venomously at Yang Kai in the distance, his desire to act barely restrained. “Grandpa, what about this man…”

“Find your own chance. His strength isn’t high; you can handle him.”

“Yes!” Long Hui smiled coldly.

They could not act now; after all, Hu Mei’er would still come out soon. But since Yang Kai was a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, he would not escape.

Yang Kai did not wait long before Hu Mei’er emerged, flushed with sweat but smiling brightly, pressing four seeds into his hand. “Mission accomplished.”

When a lady of the Blood Battle Gang wanted to buy something, which disciple dared refuse?

“Thank you!” Yang Kai carefully tucked the four seeds into his bosom.

He stood still for a long moment, then struggled with his expression. “You helped me once; I owe you a personal favor.”

Hu Mei’er looked at him curiously. “What do you mean?”

Yang Kai beckoned, “Come with me.”

Though unsure of his intentions, Hu Mei’er obediently followed.

After walking about thirty zhang, Yang Kai suddenly stopped and lightly stomped his foot. “Remember where I’m standing now. About seventy zhang underground here, there should be something unusual.”

Hu Mei’er’s eyes widened in surprise. “How do you know?”

Yang Kai pondered. “I have cultivated a martial technique that allows me to sense Yang attribute energy within a certain range. There is a Yang attribute treasure down there, its energy fluctuations a thousand times purer than Yang Flame Stones.”

When he first arrived, Yang Kai had sensed this place was different from others. After much thought, he decided to share this information with Hu Mei’er. After all, this was the Blood Battle Gang’s territory; even if he coveted it, he could not seize it. Moreover, it was a way to repay Hu Mei’er’s kindness—he had noticed how she had helped him today.

“Ah?” Hu Mei’er’s expression changed sharply.

“Do you trust me?”

“I do!” she answered without hesitation, which moved Yang Kai slightly.

“That’s good.” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Though I don’t know exactly what’s down there, it must be valuable. Besides it, there seem to be other things, but I cannot sense them clearly. I suspect the secrets hidden below are the root cause of the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area’s peculiar nature. Or rather, it is likely because of their existence that a subterranean vein runs here.”

Hu Mei’er was deeply moved. If Yang Kai’s words were true, the secret beneath was indeed of great importance.

“You’re a smart girl. You should know what to do,” Yang Kai said solemnly.

“I understand,” Hu Mei’er nodded repeatedly.

“Alright, let’s go.” Yang Kai smiled.

“Mm.”

Walking through the dense forest, neither spoke, simply enjoying the moment’s peace.

Hu Mei’er was happy. Yang Kai had entrusted her with such important news, clearly his impression of her had greatly improved. She recalled how last time he had been brusque and commanding with her.

But this time was different; he was much gentler.

“Let’s part ways here,” Yang Kai suddenly stopped. Hu Mei’er was startled to realize they had unknowingly reached the four-way crossroads. Time had flown so fast! She felt a bit wistful.

“Farewell,” Yang Kai said, then hurried toward Lingxiao Pavilion.

What a carefree man! Hu Mei’er smiled wryly.
