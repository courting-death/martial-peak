## Chapter 1769 — Jingkong Beast

But now was not the best time to dwell on those matters; at this moment Yang Kai felt as if he possessed a richly stocked Treasure Vault and held its key, and he was even standing inside the Treasure Vault itself.

Yet he had no time to inspect or deal with his treasures!

He reined in his mind and turned to look toward where Xue Yue was.

He had not forgotten that in a place like this someone was worrying over him, calling his name again and again and treating him as a reliance.

But when he looked, Yang Kai could not help but furrow his brow, for there was no one in that direction at all; Xue Yue was nowhere to be seen.

He scanned around; within the reach of his Divine Sense there was likewise no trace of Xue Yue.

Where had she gone? Yang Kai frowned inwardly. He did not think Xue Yue would abandon him at the first sign of danger; although he had not spent much time with her and did not know her thoroughly, from their brief, earnest interactions she was not that sort of person.

And within this rift of void, someone who had not cultivated Spatial Force, no matter how strong, would be like a headless fly; even if she spent ten million years, she could not hope to leave this place.

So it was impossible that she had gone off on her own to find a way out.

Had she encountered some danger? A chill ran through Yang Kai as that possibility occurred to him, but what danger could there be in this rift? Although this place was a chaotic void drifting outside the Lost Realm, the two of them had not encountered any perils on their journey.

After standing there pondering for a moment, Yang Kai began to move; in any case, he had to find Xue Yue first.

He set off; with a single stride he was already a hundred li away, calm in expression, each step resonating with the subtleties of Spatial Force.

In the past, Yang Kai had needed to tear space itself to move several hundred or even a thousand li at once. Later, as his mastery over Spatial Power deepened, he became capable of short-distance teleportation—but even then, it was only for a dozen or twenty li, a distance hardly worth mentioning.

But now he could easily cover a hundred li in a single step, and that was far from his limit.

As he moved he tested the insights gained from devouring the spiral of power, further refining his comprehension of Spatial Force.

By his reckoning, even if Xue Yue had left, she could not have gone too far; after all, in a place like this she could not possibly escape to any great distance.

So he centered his search on his previous location, expanding outward in widening circles.

Sure enough, about half an incense-stick later, Yang Kai discovered Xue Yue's figure!

But she was in a dreadful state, frantically fleeing through that desolate void, her long hair disheveled and blood seeping from the corner of her mouth.

Behind her pursued a strange demonic beast seven or eight zhang long, looking much like a sea lion. The beast's body was fat and bulky, with a broad tail; as it writhed it followed behind Xue Yue at an unhurried pace, occasionally emitting a piercing, long cry.

When Yang Kai saw this Demonic Beast, his eyes narrowed, and a look of astonishment appeared on his face.

For he could clearly sense on that beast the same source of power as his own—Spatial Force!

Every motion and writhe of the beast contained the subtleties of space; it seemed able to let its body glide along spatial trajectories. Thus, though its movements appeared exceedingly clumsy, it could still easily keep pace with the desperately fleeing Xue Yue.

Or rather, it had no intention of killing Xue Yue immediately; it held a cat-and-mouse mindset, toying with her and taking pleasure in the chase.

As Yang Kai caught sight of Xue Yue, the beast had just opened its catfish-like maw and expelled a visible streak of energy from its mouth.

That energy was like a blade, easily slicing open the space and rushing toward Xue Yue's back.

Sensing the terrifying force behind her, Xue Yue's face changed; she bit through the tip of her tongue, and the phantom of her Companion Yao Spirit—Xiezhi—immediately manifested above her head. Xiezhi was covered in dense black fur, its eyes bright and spirited, a single horn on its brow; it looked powerful, and upon appearing it let out a roar and hurled itself backward without hesitation.

Xiezhi was a Companion Yao Spirit whose combat strength could rival Xue Yue herself; ordinary practitioners of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm were no match for it.

But that attack easily cleaved Xiezhi's phantom in two.

With pitiful wails, Xiezhi's phantom dissipated and vanished.

And Xue Yue, as the host, was grievously wounded; she spat blood again, her delicate form tottering, and even her speed of flight slackened.

Xue Yue dared not look back; her beautiful eyes were dim and colorless.

At that moment, a figure descended from the sky and swept her up into his arms.

Xue Yue strained to lift her head and immediately saw Yang Kai's resolute face; even in the darkness she felt an endless light emanating from it, as if it had lit a lamp on the dim road ahead of her.

"You're finally here!" Xue Yue managed a faint smile and said in a breathless whisper.

"There was a little accident," Yang Kai said, nodding; as he spoke he activated his Saint Yuan to scan Xue Yue's body. Frowning slightly, he found her condition far from ideal. He did not know how long she'd been entangled with the beast; her Saint Yuan was nearly exhausted, her meridians and flesh much damaged. If he'd been any later, even if the beast hadn't killed her, she might have died from exhaustion.

"How did you provoke it?" Yang Kai asked, looking at the beast hovering in the void.

“It appeared on its own.” Xue Yue, her whole body resting in Yang Kai’s arms, answered softly, “I waited there for you for several days, but you showed no sign of movement. I don’t know when this Demonic Beast showed up nearby—it seemed to be drawn to you and charged straight toward your direction. I was afraid it might disturb you, so I just…”

"So you lured it away?" Yang Kai looked down at her.

Xue Yue hesitated for a moment, then nodded.

Yang Kai let out a soft sigh, a warm feeling filling his heart.

"Your body... what's wrong?" Xue Yue suddenly exclaimed, panic in her face as she inspected the abnormalities on Yang Kai's body. The faintly visible flesh and black lines made her think something had happened to him, and she was instantly alarmed.

“Some of the power is just out of control, nothing serious. I only need to completely merge with it.” Yang Kai gave a brief explanation, then patted Xue Yue’s back and said, “Don’t worry. What we need to deal with now is this thing.”

As he spoke, he fixed a grave look on the strange beast ahead.

Xue Yue's expression shifted; she whispered, "Be careful — it's formidable, its strength is definitely not lower than an expert of the Void King Realm, and it is versed in Spatial Force. If I'm not mistaken, it should be..."

"Jingkong Beast!" Yang Kai grinned. "I know."

His main purpose in entering this Lost Realm with Luo Lan had been precisely the Jingkong Beast.

What surprised him was that he would discover traces of a Jingkong Beast under such circumstances.

Able to drift within a void rift and innately versed in Spatial Force—what else could it be other than a Jingkong Beast? So even though Yang Kai had never seen such a demonic beast before, he could recognize it instantly.

"It's enough that you know," Xue Yue relaxed, snuggling deeper into Yang Kai's arms and arranging herself comfortably, murmuring, "I'll leave the rest to you — I entrust my life to you."

Having said that, she immediately activated a secret technique and fell into sleep.

She was at the point of utter exhaustion, so she had to heal immediately; the technique she used, however, could only be carried out while she slept.

"You trust me that much?" Yang Kai smiled faintly, feeling a surge of responsibility, murmuring to himself, "I won't let you down."

Saying this, he rolled Xue Yue onto his back and hoisted her up. He then activated his Saint Yuan, coalescing it into the form of a rope to bind her body tightly to his, moved his limbs to ensure he wouldn't fling her off no matter what, and only then did he leisurely turn his gaze toward the Jingkong Beast.

Since Yang Kai had appeared, the Jingkong Beast had remained motionless.

However, the two small eyes on its fat head glowed terrifyingly as they fixed on Yang Kai, as if Yang Kai were a tasty meal before it, stirring its appetite.

The Jingkong Beast was born naturally versed in Spatial Force. Yang Kai had just devoured and absorbed that spatial spiral, further increasing his comprehension of Spatial Force, and the vast Spatial Force contained within his body was somewhat out of control; the aura emanating from him naturally delighted the Jingkong Beast.

Their eyes met; Yang Kai's gaze was aggressive, and the beast's animal pupils did not flinch.

In that boundless void rift, both man and beast felt the other's fighting intent.

“Come then.” After a long moment, Yang Kai beckoned to the Jingkong Beast. “I want your Inner Core, and you want my body. Let’s see whose skill prevails—who will claim what they desire, and who will end up paving the way for another!”

Whether the Jingkong Beast understood Yang Kai or was simply enraged by his provocation, in the next moment it let out an earth-shattering roar. Its maw gaped, and clusters of pitch-black energy, like cannon rounds, sped toward Yang Kai.

These energy attacks were astonishingly swift; after all, they were unleashed by the Jingkong Beast and imbued with Spatial Force, instantly negating distance and striking right in front of Yang Kai.

This was an attack fierce enough to threaten a practitioner of the Void King Realm!

Yang Kai's eyes shone brightly; facing such an assault, he showed no intention of retreating. Instead his fighting spirit surged as he flicked his fingers in quick succession.

Secret technique: Space Blade!

Whoosh whoosh whoosh...

Crescent-shaped spatial blades streaked out, meeting the Jingkong Beast's Void Roar with unerring accuracy.

Space Blade was the only offensive Spatial secret technique Yang Kai had comprehended; it had always been one of his trump cards, infallible and a source of many of his victories.

And after devouring and merging with that spatial spiral, the power of this technique had increased by several times over!

Though the size of the Space Blades he flung out had not changed, he could control them far more precisely and their lethality had skyrocketed.
