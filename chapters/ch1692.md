## Chapter 1692 — Corpse Spirit Sect Leader

The figure seated on the chair wore ordinary clothes, yet his features were shrouded by a strange layer of energy; even when Yang Kai summoned his Divine Sense, he could not pierce through to see the true face.

Still, Yang Kai felt the man was somewhat familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before.

This realization caused Yang Kai to knit his brows.

If his guess was right, this man should be the mysterious leader of the Corpse Spirit Sect.

Yet Yang Kai could sense no Corpse Qi from him at all! In other words, he was not of the Corpse Spirit Race.

Could it be, as Yang Yan said, that this fellow was the one who had battled Yang Yan back then, only that he had learned how to transform and command the Corpse Spirits, which is why he could sit so high above others?

While Yang Kai was lost in thought, the man suddenly laughed, lightly rubbing his palms together and speaking in an approving tone: “You really found your way here; you have some nerve!”

At the sound of his voice, Yang Kai’s brow lifted and his expression turned strange; his gaze grew deep and fixed on the man as if he could now see through that veil and discern the true face.

The other party showed no intention of hiding; the strange force on his face gradually dissipated, revealing a handsome visage.

“Lu Ye?” Yang Kai called sharply.

That person, it turned out, was none other than Lu Ye, Young Master of Liu Yun Valley, who had several times made life difficult for him and even tried to kill him!

Their first encounter had been in the Flowing Flame Sandland over the Red Candle Fruit; Lu Ye had secretly struck, and Yang Kai had fought him fiercely — resulting in Yang Kai severing one of his arms, though Lu Ye still escaped with his life.

Later, in the battle at Dragon Lair Mountain, Lu Ye’s shadow was behind the Xie Family; it was Lu Ye who instigated and manipulated Xie Li and the others to attack Dragon Lair Mountain.

Yang Kai had no idea what grievance bound Lu Ye to him, making him so fixated on Yang Kai.

Previously Yang Kai had assumed it was mere personal hatred, but now… a flash of insight struck him as he linked the clues together and a wildly bold hypothesis rose in his mind.

“Perhaps I should not call you Lu Ye — after all, this is merely the body you occupied by possession!” Yang Kai’s mouth curved into a faint arc, his tone confident.

The Lu Ye sitting on the chair plainly looked stunned for a moment, as if some secret had been divined; he stared at Yang Kai in surprise. “You actually guessed this — I underestimated you!”

“It wasn't hard,” Yang Kai gave a light laugh. “We first met at the Soul Cleansing Divine Water in Flowing Flame Sandland. I obtained a Void Mind Crystal there, and since then, you’ve never been able to forget me. So that Void Mind Crystal was yours, huh?”

Lu Ye’s formerly handsome and peaceful face suddenly distorted, veins bulging on the back of his hand. He snarled: “Correct. That was my Void Mind Crystal. Where did you take it? Why can I not sense its aura?”

This matter was a nightmare for Lu Ye — if Yang Kai had not taken that Void Mind Crystal. After usurping the body, he only needed to fuse his own Void Mind Crystal to instantly recover at least half his power; even if the Dark Star’s laws of suppression prevented him from breaking through to the Void King Realm on the spot, a person of his caliber could still leave the Dark Star at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm without much difficulty.

As long as he found a place to go into seclusion for a few dozen years, recovering his former cultivation would no longer be just a dream. By then, the entire Star Domain would be his for the taking.

But all of that had been ruined by Yang Kai!

He couldn’t even sense the existence of his own Void Mind Crystal, much less retrieve it. That crystal was the culmination and essence of his lifetime of cultivation. Without it, given the aptitude of Lu Ye’s body, restoring his strength would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens.

Many years had passed and he had only reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — a state he found intolerable!

“Sorry, but I’ve already absorbed it,” Yang Kai said lightly, tapping his temple.

“Impossible!” Lu Ye denied outright, looking down on Yang Kai as one would a mere ant, sneering: “With your strength you presumptuously think you could absorb my Void Mind Crystal?!”

The soul that had usurped Lu Ye’s body had been, in life, an existence on par with the Starry Sky Emperor; the Void Mind Crystal it left naturally was of the highest caliber. Even a Void King Realm practitioner rushing to fuse with it would have their Sea of Consciousness ruptured and their soul destroyed.

At the time Yang Kai had only been at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — how could he possibly have fused it?

Lu Ye plainly did not believe such nonsense, assuming Yang Kai lied and had hidden the crystal by some special means so he could not sense it.

“Believe it or not.” Yang Kai shrugged carelessly; he had no obligation to explain. With a treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus, fusing that Void Mind Crystal required little on his part — he himself had only learned much later that the stone had been a Void Mind Crystal.

“Spare me your chatter. Since you’re here today, don’t think you’ll leave. Where is my Void Mind Crystal? Once I capture you, I’ll have my answers!” Lu Ye snorted, his aura suddenly turning violent and demonic.

Yang Kai laughed heartily. “You’re at death’s door and still spouting such shameless boasts!”

Lu Ye was momentarily taken aback by that retort.

In the next instant the entire Corpse Den trembled as if the earth itself shook; from above a piercing, overwhelming aura descended, so powerful that Lu Ye was frozen in place and could not move, his face darkening as he stood rooted.

Rumble……

The ground seemed to split; a tremendous sound rolled down from above, and in moments a hole opened in the roof of the palace. A figure burst through and struck a palm toward Lu Ye.

Lu Ye’s expression changed drastically as he frantically exerted his Shi, trying to throw off the crushing momentum.

But before that palm, all his efforts were in vain.

The Shi was easily shattered, the palm landed, and Lu Ye only managed a cry before being crushed into a pulp, blood and organs flowing in a crimson tide.

Qian Tong fell down, his face puzzled; he exchanged a glance with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s face was likewise one of astonishment.

Neither of them had expected Lu Ye to be killed so easily!

“Was that the leader of the Corpse Spirit Sect?” Elder Qian asked in disbelief.

Yang Kai nodded: “Yes, that’s him!”

“I overrated him.” Elder Qian snorted coldly; although he had not regarded this Corpse Spirit Sect leader highly, he had not expected the man to be slain so readily — it felt like punching cotton.

Yang Kai stayed silent, though a discordant unease gnawed at him; deep down he felt Lu Ye could not have died so easily, after all Lu Ye had once escaped death under Yang Yan’s hands and even Yang Yan had not discovered him.

Even if Qian Tong was a Void King Realm expert, in guile and craftiness he could hardly compare to this fellow.

Realizing this, Yang Kai was alarmed and immediately released his Divine Sense, frantically spreading it outward.

Under his perception, the entire situation across Zangxiong Valley became clear in an instant.

He sensed a subtle aura fleeing outward at an incredible speed, concealed to the utmost; if not for his suspicions and deliberate probing, he might never have noticed it.

As that aura fled, it bore faint undulations of Spatial Force.

“Elder Qian!” Yang Kai shouted, thrusting his hands forward into the void and tearing hard to either side; a spatial rent immediately formed.

Qian Tong frowned, not understanding why Yang Kai acted so, but instinctively trusting him, he didn’t question and dove into the spatial fissure with Yang Kai.

Outside Zangxiong Valley, a Corpse General in black robes had been meditating in concealment as if he had sat there a very long time without any movement.

At a certain moment the Black-Robed Corpse General trembled, the hidden aura climbing step by step until it reached the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — hardly weaker than Ye Xijun.

He slowly opened his eyes, venom and shock flickering in his pupils as he gnashed his teeth and roared, “Void King Realm! You’re actually a Void King Realm! How could there be someone of that level here? Old bastard, I’ll remember this—this palm strike, I’ll repay it in full!”

“You won’t have a chance!” A familiar voice unexpectedly came from behind.

The Black-Robed Corpse General was startled and whipped his head around, just in time to see a spatial rip open silently and Yang Kai and Qian Tong step out.

The Black-Robed Corpse General’s face fell into panic and without thinking let out a roar and tried to flee.

“Where are you going?” Qian Tong bellowed, his Domain bursting forth to instantly envelope the Black-Robed Corpse General.

Yang Kai did not strike; he only watched the Corpse General closely and pushed his Divine Sense to the limit, observing his movements.

Yang Kai had seen this Black-Robed Corpse General before — he should be a senior brother to the White-Clad Corpse General Kang Feirao — but now, possessed by the soul that had usurped Lu Ye, he had become an entirely different person.

Though powerful at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm, that cultivation still counted for little before Qian Tong.

At the moment the Black-Robed Corpse General’s body was pulverized and his soul annihilated, Yang Kai sensed a hidden aura making a spatial leap and instantly departing the place, flying hundreds of li away without the slightest pause!

That was clearly the aura of the Corpse Spirit Sect leader; if not for Yang Kai’s mastery of Spatial Force, he would never have detected such a departure.

After dispatching the Black-Robed Corpse General, Qian Tong turned and looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said nothing and tore open space once more; in the next instant the two of them appeared several hundreds of li away.

Just as they stepped out of the spatial fissure, Yang Kai and Qian Tong saw a Corpse General in cyan racing madly into the distance.

Before Qian Tong could act, Yang Kai unleashed a dozen or so Golden Blood Threads that braided together into a brilliant golden arrow, shattering the void; it pierced the cyan Corpse General’s abdomen, tearing out a hole and shattering his Corpse Pearl.

The Golden Blood Threads circled and then flew back; Yang Kai felt no triumph in slaying a powerful enemy — instead his face was sullen as he tore space for the third time.
