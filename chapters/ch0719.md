## Chapter 719 — Return

When Yang Kai appeared, he did not conceal his aura, so of course they detected him.

The six kept vigilance even in battle; clearly they had good awareness. Although they realized Yang Kai had no hostile intent, they still detached a man and a woman to feign attacks nearby, watching Yang Kai closely as if afraid he might suddenly leap out and spoil their fight.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and paid their caution no mind. When strangers are met in the field, especially during a fight, their conduct was unquestionably correct.

The demonic beast they were dealing with was not of high rank — only level six — and under the combined assault of the remaining four, it was soon slain.

After they tidied up and rested for a while, Yang Kai stepped forward amicably to greet them and asked for directions.

"To Fuyun City?" one of the women furrowed her dark brows and scrutinized Yang Kai, pointing in a direction. "Fuyun City is this way. Follow this direction and you can reach it in three to five days."

"Thanks!" Yang Kai exhaled; he had indeed been worried that the place he returned to might be far from Fuyun City. The Tongxuan Continent is vast — if the Void Passage in the starry sky had transported him to a distant spot, it would not be surprising to have to fly for a year or more.

"Friend, why are you heading to Fuyun City now? The contest for the Thousand-Year Demon Flower ended a year ago. You didn't get the news, did you?" said a burly man.

"A year?" Yang Kai's face went dark. He had underestimated the passage of time, thinking he'd at most loitered in the starry sky for half a year, never expecting a whole year had gone by.

Seeing his continuous astonishment, they immediately misunderstood him, thinking he had gone to Fuyun City to compete for the Thousand-Year Demon Flower but missed the opportunity.

The three women all pursed their lips and laughed softly, looking at him as if he were an idiot.

"Yes, it ended a year ago. They say two young men got there first, but those two have gone missing; many are looking for them now, hoping to buy the flower's medicinal liquid from them," the big man said with a smile. "You're a bit late to get here, friend."

"I truly didn't know." Yang Kai grew alert and thought to remove the disguise treasure from his face — otherwise, if someone with intent discovered him, it would certainly be troublesome.

"Where are you from, friend, that news reaches you so slowly?" the big man laughed as he asked.

"From a rural place; news does travel slowly there," Yang Kai replied perfunctorily. Before he could say more, he cupped his fists. "In any case, thank you. Farewell!"

With that, he sped off in the direction the woman had indicated.

"This fellow is amusing — a bit slow on the uptake," the woman beside the burly man laughed coquettishly.

"Never mind him. Let's first examine the quality of this beast's inner core."

The six immediately grew expectant.

Yang Kai streaked along like wind and lightning. Mid-flight he reached up and removed the disguise treasure covering his face, revealing his true looks.

The disguise treasure Elder Du had given him was indeed somewhat useful. Had he not had that treasure, Yang Kai reckoned he would now surely be hunted by Transcendent Realm experts across the continent.

At the thought of Zhai Yao getting into such an ordeal, Yang Kai felt a measure of schadenfreude.

But Zhai Yao had Elder Li watching over him. Even if people tracked him down, no one would dare provoke him.

…………

Fuyun City — the City Lord's Mansion.

Elder Li and Zhai Yao had been guests here for a year. The City Lord, the Deputy City Lord, and the Saint Realm experts among the human, demon, and monster three races were naturally elated.

Though they did not know why the two lingered so long, with Elder Li as a guest, they basked in honor, visiting daily and calling themselves juniors, taking particularly good care of Zhai Yao.

At this moment Zhai Yao was listening as Elder Li lectured him, learning his art of pill refinement.

Nine months earlier Zhai Yao had already returned; he had loitered in the starry sky for three months and obtained benefits beyond imagination — a result that greatly pleased Elder Li.

He had originally thought Zhai Yao could stay in the starry sky for at most a month, but his disciple's performance had far exceeded his expectations.

While speaking, Elder Li suddenly noticed Zhai Yao was somewhat absent-minded. Smiling faintly, he ceased lecturing and asked, "Are you worrying about that Yang fellow?"

"Yes." Zhai Yao nodded. "I should have acted with him. It's been over a year and he still hasn't returned. Teacher, you don't suppose he would—"

"If so, that is his fate!" Elder Li sat down, sipped fragrant tea, set the cup down, and said calmly, "I find it hard to imagine he survived a year in the starry sky."

If not for Zhai Yao's insistence on waiting at the City Lord's Mansion for Yang Kai, Elder Li would have long since taken him traveling the world. Though he had a promise with Yang Kai, with Elder Li's respected status, waiting this long was already enough.

"Brother Yang shouldn't be dead, right?" Zhai Yao frowned, his tone uncertain.

"It seems you still have some faith in him," Elder Li chuckled.

"Yes — I saw his body's toughness in the starry sky!" Zhai Yao's eyes shone with shock. "Even though I refined my body for three months there, I wouldn't dare compare myself to him. It's hard to believe someone like him could simply perish."

"A year is a long time. Getting lost or suffering some accident are both possible," Elder Li sighed. "I don't wish someone like him to die young, but if that is the fact, there is nothing to be done. Yao'er, we should leave this place; lingering too long is unwise."

"Teacher, wait ten more days. If he hasn't returned in ten days, then we'll go!" Zhai Yao pleaded.

"Very well, ten more days — let's see if he can perform a miracle!" Elder Li nodded. No sooner had he spoken than his expression grew sharp and strange.

"What's happened, teacher?" Zhai Yao asked in puzzlement; he rarely saw his teacher wear such an expression, as if something had astonished him to the extreme.

"It seems a miracle has actually occurred," Elder Li said, looking at him.

"You mean..." Zhai Yao suddenly realized, astonished and overjoyed.

"Yes." Elder Li nodded with emphasis.

"Haha, I knew that kid couldn't die. Where is he now?" Zhai Yao laughed loudly.

"He's in that inn."

"I'm going to find him! I want to see what he's become." Zhai Yao said, then dashed out.

"Remember to bring him here; I have words to speak to him." Elder Li's voice called after him; Zhai Yao responded at once.

Once his disciple had left, Elder Li remained stunned, murmuring, "A year's time — could that youngster really have been in the starry sky for a year? How did he survive?"

Elder Li had once experienced the dangers of the starry sky a thousand years ago; no matter how much time had passed, the starry sky remained perilous and was not a place anyone could freely tread.

Half a year ago, Elder Li had concluded Yang Kai was unlikely to return, but seeing Zhai Yao's insistence, he had not exposed the truth, lest it dishearten him.

In this world there were few who could rival Zhai Yao in pill refinement; his disciple regarded that youngster as his greatest opponent, a fact Elder Li understood well.

Yet now he discovered he had been terribly, laughably wrong.

As an elder sage he possessed piercing insight and seldom erred; Yang Kai's miraculous return made him wonder whether fate itself had arranged such an outcome.

He slowly shook his head, pondered for a long while, and smiled.

In the inn, Yang Kai's return filled Cang Yan and Fei Yu with indescribable joy.

For more than a year the two senior uncles had been waiting in Fuyun City; although Zhai Yao invited them to the City Lord's Mansion, they had politely declined.

They didn't assume Ao Gu and the others were courteous to Elder Li and Zhai Yao out of genuine warmth — it was because of Elder Li's standing.

If Cang Yan and the others had actually gone over there, Ao Gu would not have treated them well.

"You brat, you're finally back." Cang Yan laughed heartily, a great weight lifting from his chest.

Fei Yu's beautiful eyes brimmed; her eyelashes trembled, her cheeks flushed as she stared at Yang Kai in stunned disbelief.

"Senior Aunt, you're drinking again," Yang Kai said exasperatedly. The room reeked of strong wine; it was obvious Fei Yu had been at it.

"What's wrong with having a little wine? Mind your own business," Fei Yu's red lips moved as she glared, then she broke into a charming smile.

"Good to have you back — you had Fei Yu worrying herself sick, drowning her sorrow in drink; I'm nearly suffocated," Cang Yan complained at once.

"Where are Senior Uncles Li Wan and Fei Jian?" Yang Kai looked around; he did not see them nor sense their presence in the inn.

"They've already returned," Cang Yan explained. "You don't know how long you've been away, do you?"

"I know." Yang Kai nodded.

"Well, the sect can't be left empty, so they returned early. Cang Yan and Fei Yu stayed here to wait; Elder Du and Mi Na also returned to the Alchemists' Association in Giant Stone City. Now that you're back, we can depart."

"Sorry to have worried you, Senior Uncles." Yang Kai felt guilty. Even after being gone for over a year, he saw no suspicion on their faces — only the relieved release that he had returned safely.

Any outsider might have suspected he had obtained the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's medicinal liquid and fled.

But the senior uncles clearly did not think so.

"I was worried too — Brother Yang, what will you say?" Suddenly a hearty laugh came from outside as Zhai Yao strode in.

Scanning the room, Zhai Yao scratched his head and asked incredulously, "Where is Brother Yang? Didn't I hear his voice? Who is this guy?"

As he spoke he sized Yang Kai up and down, suspicious and puzzled.
