## Chapter 51 — The Seed’s Mutation

Settling down beside Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai was about to begin his cultivation when suddenly something came to mind.

He reached into his bosom and, after a moment’s search, pulled out a single seed. This seed had been given as a gift by the vendor at the Blood Battle Gang’s stall when he purchased the Yang Flame Stone earlier that day.

It was said to be a Common-Grade Lower-Level Spirit Fruit seed—the Three-Yang Fruit.

Yang Kai intended to plant it, though he had no idea how many years it would take to mature. It was no trouble to do so, and this place was brimming with Yang energy, undoubtedly the most suitable environment to cultivate such a fruit tree.

But the moment he took out the seed, Yang Kai sensed something amiss.

During the day, the seed had shown no abnormality; inside, it contained only a faint trace of Yang energy, almost negligible.

Yet now, the seed had turned a vivid crimson, crystal clear like a red gem. Holding it in his hand, Yang Kai could even feel rhythmic pulses emanating from within.

It was as if... as if a human heart were beating—full of vibrant life.

Moreover, the Yang energy contained within the seed was now incomparably greater than it had been during the day.

Staring blankly for a moment, Yang Kai suddenly snapped back to reality! He realized where the drop of Yang liquid that had vanished from his dantian had gone.

It had clearly been absorbed by this seed! Otherwise, how could such an ordinary seed undergo such a drastic transformation? Refining a single drop of Yang liquid without external aid would take him several days of effort.

Yang Kai nearly lost control and wanted to reabsorb the Yang liquid from the seed.

But after some thought, he refrained. This seed had clearly undergone a significant change. If he planted it, what might it become when it bore fruit?

The young man’s curiosity and thirst for knowledge burned fiercely. Compared to a precious drop of Yang liquid, Yang Kai was far more eager to witness the changes that would come from planting the seed.

After careful consideration, Yang Kai set to work. He first found a patch of soft earth nearby, gently cleared the soil, and planted the seed. Then he fetched some water to nourish it.

Having finished, Yang Kai sat down and began to circulate the True Yang Technique.

He had no idea whether investing a drop of Yang liquid would yield any return.

The night passed uneventfully. After so many days of arduous cultivation, his absorption of Yang energy had noticeably quickened. By the end of the night’s practice, the Yang energy in his meridians was once again replenished.

He estimated that in two or three days, he would be able to refine another drop of Yang liquid. Compared to the first time, the efficiency was undoubtedly much higher.

The next morning, Yang Kai practiced the Body Tempering Chapter for half an hour.

He had never missed a day of practicing the Body Tempering Chapter. Aside from sweeping the floor, it was his daily routine. Then he would find a junior disciple to challenge, earn some Contribution Points, and spend the rest of his time cultivating without pause.

After half an hour, Yang Kai finished. Casually glancing toward the spot where he had planted the Three-Yang Fruit seed the previous night, his expression froze.

From the soft earth there now grew a sapling about a zhang tall! The slender sapling bore several tender leaves, fresh and dewy. Within its thin trunk, faint dark red veins intertwined. Though small, the sapling radiated a vitality that could not be ignored, struggling to break free from the confines of the world and grow robustly.

No way! Yang Kai felt his mind reel. How could the Three-Yang Fruit tree have grown so large in just one night? For a moment, he even thought he had lost track of time during cultivation, allowing many days to slip by unnoticed.

But on closer reflection, that was impossible. His True Yang Primordial Qi had not increased significantly; it had only been one night’s effort. Could all this be the work of the drop of Yang liquid that had seeped into the seed?

It was not out of the question. His knowledge only said that Yang liquid had infinite uses but never limited it to combat alone.

If the Yang liquid had caused the seed’s transformation, it would explain the scene before him.

Growing a zhang in a single night—could it bear fruit in just a few days? At the thought, Yang Kai’s heart surged with excitement. The Three-Yang Fruit was a Common-Grade Lower-Level Spirit Fruit, its Yang attribute energy a great boon to his True Yang Technique. One fruit could easily equal many days of cultivation.

With this in mind, Yang Kai felt his investment was extraordinarily wise. Now all that remained was to wait and see how many days it would take for the tree to flower and bear fruit.

This place beside Dragon Confinement Ravine was rarely visited. Yang Kai had cultivated here for many days and, aside from encountering Elder Eleven once, had seen no one else. Thus, he was not overly concerned about the fruit tree being discovered.

Returning to his wooden hut, Yang Kai sought to finish his daily chores. But after searching for some time, he could not find his broom, leaving him puzzled.

After a while, a Lingxiao Pavilion disciple approached, his head covered in sweat, carrying Yang Kai’s broom.

Yang Kai recognized him as one of Su Mu’s group, a disciple at the fifth stage of the Body Tempering Realm, named Zheng.

Seeing Yang Kai standing there, Zheng hurried forward. “Senior Brother Yang, you’re back?”

“Yes. Zheng Junior Brother, where have you been? Why did you take my broom?”

Zheng smiled. “I went to sweep for you. Senior Brother, don’t trouble yourself with these trivial tasks anymore. One of us junior brothers will come each day to finish the work for you. You just focus on your cultivation.”

“That’s not quite right,” Yang Kai quickly waved his hand. Sweeping was not heavy work, but it did take effort. If he did not intend to remain in Lingxiao Pavilion, he would have long since given up this chore. But as a Trial Disciple, he needed to take on some tasks to have a place within the Pavilion.

Zheng said, “Senior Brother, you’re too modest. We brothers should support one another. If you hadn’t dealt with Cheng Shaofeng and the others, we wouldn’t have been able to vent our grievances. Besides, there are many of us; one person comes each day, taking turns. Each of us only sweeps two or three times a month on average. Senior Brother, you don’t have to wake early every day and waste your time. Don’t refuse us—if you look down on us, then forget it.”

With words spoken so earnestly, what could Yang Kai do? He quickly said, “Then I’ll trouble you all. Zheng Junior Brother, come in and have some water.”

“No, Su Shao has issued a strict order. We all must cultivate diligently now. Anyone who dares to slack off is no longer a brother. I must go. Senior Brother, you work hard too.” Zheng set down the broom and jogged off.

Watching his retreating figure, warmth filled Yang Kai’s heart. Saving Su Mu that day had been the right choice. This man was truly upright—if you treat him with respect, he will repay you tenfold.

It seemed he would no longer need to waste time sweeping. Feeling pleased, Yang Kai stepped out and casually grabbed a Lingxiao Pavilion disciple who appeared to be at the seventh or eighth stage of Body Tempering, clasping his fists. “Junior Brother, please teach me!”

The man’s face immediately soured. “Senior Brother Yang… with so many people, why do you pick me?”

In recent days, Yang Kai had challenged one person daily and had already earned a formidable reputation. Now, any Lingxiao Pavilion disciple at the Body Tempering Realm who saw him felt a trace of fear. He was no longer the beaten, bullied youth he once was. He had won many consecutive victories, and each was decisive and clean.
