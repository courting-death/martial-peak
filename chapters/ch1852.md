## Chapter 1852 — Someone Has Backing

The Purple Star City's guard force moved without a doubt with great speed; Yang Kai had only just sent two Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm martial artists flying, and not even five breaths later someone arrived at the scene...

And the one who came was none other than Qu Zheng, one of Purple Star City's eight Deputy Commanders!

Hearing Qu Zheng's earlier harsh shout, everyone watching thought Yang Kai had surely gotten into enormous trouble this time; there was no escaping fate.

In Purple Star City, actual brawls were rare; the guards were idle most days, so when a minor friction did occur they tended to blow it up into a big matter. If someone dared make trouble and fight in the street today, what good could come of it?

When Jiang Chao heard Qu Zheng's voice he was so moved that hot tears sprang to his eyes, like a wronged young bride seeing her husband's family; he stared eagerly toward Qu Zheng's approach, ready to have him carry out justice on his behalf...

But Qu Zheng's subsequent change in attitude made Jiang Chao instantly sense that something was amiss.

Qu Zheng actually addressed that bastard deferentially as "my Lord," adopting a servile, obsequious, flattering demeanor...

What the hell was this guy's background? Jiang Chao was a little stunned.

"So it's Commander Qu!" Yang Kai recognized him at a glance as the Deputy Commander who had earlier gone to the Commerce Guild to deliver deeds; although the two had never met in person, when Yang Kai had probed with his Divine Sense back then he had naturally remembered the man's face.

And Qu Zheng could recognize Yang Kai because he had been careful and observant.

At this moment, a man who could stand beside Hua Youmeng and whose strength he could not discern — apart from the Lord Commander Lu Tianfeng had warned about — who else could it be?

Now, upon hearing Yang Kai's voice, Qu Zheng immediately confirmed that this was indeed that Lord whom even Commander Lu Tianfeng treated with caution!

His manner grew even more humble at once; he hurriedly waved his hand and said, "I wouldn't dare, you flatter me, my Lord; before you, how could I presume to call myself a Commander."

Having spoken, he then asked cautiously, "My Lord, what happened here?"

"It's nothing much." Yang Kai chuckled and pointed at Jiang Chao. "This friend relied on his lofty status and tried to swallow President Hua's Commerce Guild. When President Hua refused, he was humiliated and tried to use force; I couldn't stand by, so I stepped in and taught them a lesson."

"What?" Qu Zheng flared with anger. "Who dares be so brazen as to use force on President Hua? Are they tired of living?"

As he spoke, a pair of stern eyes looked toward Jiang Chao, and when his face was seen the man could not help but start: "Young Master Jiang?"

After recognizing Jiang Chao, Qu Zheng's mood instantly soured...

It was Jiang Chao, that second-generation brat, who had come into conflict with this Lord — what was to be done? Jiang Chao might not have much public standing, but he was, after all, a descendant of Elder Jiang Changfeng, and not someone a small-time Deputy Commander could afford to offend. And this mysterious Lord was someone even Commander Lu Tianfeng feared; with those two pressing him from both sides, how could he handle the matter?

Qu Zheng wished he had never come to this place...

But regretting it did no good now; Qu Zheng could only curse Jiang Chao quietly in his heart and think that this sightless second-generation brat had offended the wrong person, dragging him along into trouble.

"So it turns out to be Commander Qu, please, Commander Qu, stand up for me." Seeing Qu Zheng's fearful expression, Jiang Chao was overjoyed and pitifully pleaded, "Commander Qu, I never used force on President Hua; I only discussed merging the Commerce Guild with President Hua — business is about mutual consent, as you know. But that man didn't bother to ask the facts and injured my two guards. Commander Qu, look, my two guards still haven't gotten up; their condition is unknown; they have elders and children to care for — how will their families live?"

Moved to tears, Jiang Chao sobbed and sniveled as he poured out his complaint.

“This…” Cold sweat broke out on Qu Zheng’s forehead as he repeatedly wiped it away. Things had escalated far beyond what a mere Deputy Commander like him could handle—one wrong move, and he would end up offending both sides.

"Deputy Commander Qu, you just said the Purple Star City has strict regulations: fighting and injuring are forbidden within the city; violators may be stripped of their cultivation and thrown into the Cold Prison at the lightest, and at worst be executed on the spot. This man has scorned Purple Star City's laws; please, Deputy Commander Qu, uphold the law and restore Purple Star City's clear skies!" Jiang Chao spoke with great fervor, flailing his hands as if he could already see Yang Kai being punished.

Yang Kai looked at him as if he were a fool.

Qu Zheng's face was hideous; he wished he could shut Jiang Chao's mouth.

Purple Star City did indeed have such rules, but it depended on who they were enforced against. People with backing could ignore those rules, and the Lord standing before Qu Zheng was plainly one of them.

Qu Zheng neither dared nor had the ability to deal with Yang Kai, yet Jiang Chao's words had cornered him like being roasted over a fire, making him unbearably uncomfortable and filling him with hatred for Jiang Chao.

Yang Kai smiled and looked at Qu Zheng, "Commander Qu, are you going to take me in?"

"I wouldn't dare, my Lord, you are taking this too seriously." Qu Zheng's brow was wet with sweat and his face flushed. "This matter is suspicious; I must investigate before I can make a decision."

Jiang Chao widened his slanted eyes and shouted angrily, "Deputy Commander Qu, don't lie to me — my two guards were injured; what's there to investigate?"

Qu Zheng cursed viciously in his heart: "Fuck your ancestors to the eighteenth generation!"

Just when he was at a loss and didn't know how to handle it, he suddenly raised his head as if he had heard something, tilted an ear to listen, and then his expression brightened.

In the blink of an eye Qu Zheng regained his composure; his sharp gaze swept over Jiang Chao and, to Jiang Chao's astonishment, he declared, "Young Master Jiang, the matter has been clarified: today's incident was not this Lord's doing. You provoked and first showed disrespect, and the Lord only gave a slight punishment as a warning."

"Ah?" Jiang Chao's face froze — he never expected Qu Zheng to say this, and he had only stood there doing nothing; how could the matter have been clarified?

"Young Master Jiang, since it was your fault, please come with this Deputy Commander." Qu Zheng, who already had a bellyful of anger toward Jiang Chao, was now bolstered by backing behind him and therefore felt at ease; he looked coldly at Jiang Chao in a businesslike manner.

"Qu Zheng, you dare!" Jiang Chao shouted. "You dare take me? I am the clan grandson of the Eighth Elder; if the Eighth Elder finds out about today, do you think you'll end well?"

Qu Zheng's expression shifted slightly, but he soon sneered, "Young Master Jiang, your gall is too great. This Deputy Commander's law enforcement represents Purple Star City; even if this were reported to the Eighth Elder, he would not intervene. You dare defy and threaten this Deputy Commander — do you not hold Purple Star in regard?"

"I didn't!" Jiang Chao protested with a face full of grievance; he could not imagine things would come to this.

"Whether you did or not isn't for you to decide. Come with this Deputy Commander."

"Qu Zheng, don't take chicken feathers for an imperial seal; think carefully about my identity!" Jiang Chao barked in a display of bluster masking inner fear.

Qu Zheng waved his hand impatiently and shouted, "Seize him!"

Several Purple Star City guards rushed forward and quickly overpowered Jiang Chao.

Jiang Chao continued to struggle, cursing violently and in the vilest terms.

Qu Zheng frowned and ordered, "Seal his meridians."

The guard who had seized Jiang Chao complied, pressing a hand to Jiang Chao's back, and Jiang Chao was immediately made speechless.

"Deputy Commander Qu upholds the law with fairness and integrity; I admire you!" Yang Kai said with a cheerful smile as he cupped his fist toward Qu Zheng.

Qu Zheng's face flushed and he replied with feigned modesty, "You flatter me, my Lord; this is merely my duty. Well, since the ringleader has been captured, I will not disturb your amusement. Please go on, my Lord — I take my leave."

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

Qu Zheng gave a shout, led a host of guards, and quickly withdrew.

The many onlookers remained in shock and could not believe that Jiang Chao, who had strutted about Purple Star City, would be seized and taken away by Qu Zheng. They looked at Yang Kai with extreme caution, each guessing what sort of background could make Qu Zheng incline toward him.

Hua Youmeng also wore a look of bewilderment.

Although she knew Yang Kai had caused Commander Lu Tianfeng a loss and that his status must be extraordinary, Qu Zheng's public action undoubtedly affronted the Eighth Elder Jiang Changfeng.

Could Yang Kai's status really be so high that Qu Zheng would make that choice?

Could he be more powerful than the Eight Elders of Purple Star?

Hua Youmeng stared at that towering back as if gazing at something that could swallow heaven and earth; a mist of confusion filled her beautiful eyes.

"Let's go," Yang Kai said softly to Hua Youmeng, then headed toward the Commerce Guild. Before leaving he glanced in a particular direction, the corner of his mouth lifting in a slight smile.

"Oh." Hua Youmeng followed dumbly.

About a hundred zhang away from where Yang Kai and Jiang Chao had clashed stood a tavern called First Building Under Heaven.

The First Building Under Heaven was divided into nine levels: the lower four could be used by ordinary martial artists for drinking and revelry, while above the fourth only those with strength and status were admitted — the higher the floor, the higher the requirements.

The ninth level was reserved only for the very top experts; entry wasn't simply a matter of wealth, one also needed high renown and status.

It was said the First Building Under Heaven had even entertained several of Purple Star City's elders.

At this moment, on the ninth level two people sat beside a window and looked down below.

One wore a withered, old face, his eyes half narrowed; when his gaze opened and closed there were flashes of keen light. His aura was restrained to the utmost, occasionally leaking a ripple of power that marked him unmistakably as a Void King Realm expert.

Opposite him sat a youth in the style of a refined young master, fan in hand, bearing an air of commanding arrogance and lofty poise, his temperament plainly exceptional.
