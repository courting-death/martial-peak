## Chapter 2222 — Sacred Insect

The Xuanlong Seal was a defensive secret art comprehended by Ban Qing himself, the crystallization of a lifetime of cultivation.

Ever since he advanced to the Emperor Realm, he had only used this secret art three times, and each time, his opponent had also been an expert of the Emperor Realm.

Yet today, before Yang Kai, a mere Dao Origin Realm cultivator, he was forced to use it again.

Because he could sense that if he didn’t, he would surely die!

This feeling had no basis, yet he believed it without a doubt.

A dragon’s shadow appeared, intertwining and converging before him. In the blink of an eye, a square, shield-like barrier of light formed. On the shield, several true dragon patterns could be vaguely seen, lifelike and vivid.

After unleashing this move, Ban Qing felt slightly relieved, and that terrifying sense of dread finally faded somewhat.

Yet…

The blade swept through, plain and unadorned. The Xuanlong Seal, which could withstand a full-force blow from an Emperor Realm expert, was like tofu before the weapon in Yang Kai’s hand—utterly defenseless. Silently, the solid barrier was sliced in two, the blade meeting no resistance as it went straight for Ban Qing’s chest and abdomen.

If this strike landed, judging by the blade’s bizarre power, even someone as strong as Ban Qing would be cleaved in two.

Ban Qing’s expression changed drastically. He no longer dared to hesitate. Pushing his Divine Soul power, he retreated with all his might.

Hiss…

With a faint sound, Ban Qing forcibly broke free from Spatial Law's restraints, narrowly dodging the fatal blow by a hair’s breadth.

But a wound nearly two zhang long appeared on his chest and abdomen, slanting from his belly all the way to his shoulder, nearly severing his arm.

No blood flowed from the wound, nor was there any sign of torn flesh. Not even bone could be seen, but from within the wound, pure Divine Soul energy streamed out, dissipating into the world.

“What a pity!” Yang Kai muttered resentfully as he looked at him. Earlier, he had twice recklessly charged at Ban Qing, hoping to lure him into lowering his guard and then seize the chance for a fatal strike.

Although the plan was somewhat successful—Yang Kai’s two rash actions had indeed made Ban Qing underestimate him, allowing him to get close and create an opportunity for a desperate counterattack—an Emperor Realm expert was still an Emperor Realm expert. When faced with mortal danger, his reaction speed was extraordinary. Even at such close range and with such a sudden attack, he managed to evade.

Not far away, Ban Qing, gravely wounded, stared at the blade in Yang Kai’s hand, his eyes trembling violently and his expression shifting repeatedly. He roared, “What the hell is that thing?!”

“Soul-Severing Blade!” Yang Kai flicked the long blade in his hand, pointing it at Ban Qing from afar and grinning fiercely. “It doesn’t harm the flesh—only severs the Divine Soul!”

On this trip into the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, Yang Kai had brought only three things besides his Spirit Body.

First, the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier given to him by Gao Xueting; second, the Warm Spirit Lotus in his Sea of Consciousness; and third, this Soul-Severing Blade.

This item belonged to the Insect Emperor.

Back then, on Dark Star, the Insect Emperor wrought havoc across the land. Yang Kai slew him, obtaining both the Slave-Insect Bracelet and the Soul-Severing Blade, two Imperial Treasures.

The Slave-Insect Bracelet had special effects on various insects, and Yang Kai had escaped death several times thanks to it. As for the Soul-Severing Blade, he had rarely used it. He hadn’t even realized it was a Divine Soul Secret Treasure.

So when he first entered this world and checked his body, he was surprised to find the Soul-Severing Blade still with him.

Even though he had never refined this Imperial Treasure, its terrifying power against Divine Souls was undeniable. With the blade in hand, Yang Kai had managed to severely wound an expert like Ban Qing in a single strike. If he refined it even a little, in this special world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, taking Ban Qing’s life would be a simple matter.

Having learned his lesson, Yang Kai secretly resolved that once he returned, he would find an opportunity to properly refine the Imperial Treasures he possessed.

He hadn’t refined them before because his strength was insufficient, but now that he had reached the Dao Origin Realm, with Divine Sense rivaling the peak of that realm, refining them should pose no problem.

Whether it was the Soul-Severing Blade or the Slave-Insect Bracelet, both could be of great use in certain special situations.

“Damn it!” Ban Qing cursed under his breath. Although he didn’t understand what Yang Kai meant by “doesn’t harm the flesh,” he could clearly sense the threat posed by that long blade. It was absolutely deadly.

Now gravely wounded while Yang Kai remained unscathed—and with Yang Kai seemingly possessing strange abilities—Ban Qing was already considering retreating.

Although it would be embarrassing for an Emperor Realm expert to be forced back by a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, at this moment, Ban Qing couldn’t care less. Preserving his life was most important; face came second!

Moreover, the secret arts and techniques Ban Qing cultivated were all suited for stealth and assassination. Generally, those who practiced such arts were cautious at best, cowardly at worst. Their actions were always to flee far away if a single strike failed, never engaging in prolonged combat. In direct confrontation, their abilities were greatly diminished.

If someone like Lian Yan were standing before Yang Kai now, even if he was caught off guard and ambushed, he wouldn’t retreat immediately.

The absolute gap in strength and realm was not something a mere injury could bridge.

In short, after saying those words, Ban Qing’s figure flickered as he prepared to retreat and reconsider his options.

But at that moment, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly vanished from Ban Qing’s sight. Just a moment ago, the Dao Origin Realm brat had been standing not far away, but in the blink of an eye, he was gone.

“What?” Ban Qing was shocked. He was an expert highly skilled in concealment, yet now he realized there were always higher mountains and greater people in this world.

Yang Kai’s sudden disappearance was far superior to his own methods—it was a true spatial divine ability that ignored all barriers.

He hurriedly released his Divine Sense to search for Yang Kai’s location, but immediately a chill swept over the back of his head, as if a cold wind from the Nine Nether Purgatory were blowing, threatening to freeze his very soul.

Ban Qing’s eyes widened as he realized his enemy’s position. Not daring to delay, he spun around, unleashing a clear, forceful Divine Soul attack to the rear.

Boom…

Violent energy collided. Yang Kai was sent flying, his body flickering with light in midair, while Ban Qing remained unmoved.

The gap in realm was absolute. Even though Yang Kai had struck first with a spatial secret art, he still couldn’t achieve the desired result.

In hindsight, if Ban Qing hadn’t been so careless earlier, unaware of the existence of Divine Soul Secret Treasures, he wouldn’t have been wounded by Yang Kai’s blade. If he had been even a little more cautious, Yang Kai would never have succeeded.

“Hah!” Yang Kai landed, letting out a muffled roar, his expression shifting repeatedly. The impact on his Divine Soul was almost unbearable—the pain was far more intense than any physical wound.

It felt as if his soul was being torn apart, with no way to suppress it. All he could do was endure.

Yet Yang Kai was smiling…

Because his methods had worked again.

Buzz…

A strange sound rang out. Ban Qing was momentarily stunned, but quickly realized where it was coming from.

He hurriedly looked down, only to see that his wound was covered in countless tiny black dots. Looking closer, Ban Qing’s scalp went numb.

Those black dots were actually countless tiny insects, densely packed and innumerable.

Anyone would find it unbearable to have their body covered in such insects. What terrified Ban Qing most was that these tiny bugs were crawling into his wound, one after another, with half of them already inside in the blink of an eye.

Ban Qing’s face turned completely ashen.

With his Emperor Realm cultivation, he could clearly sense that after entering his body, these insects were devouring his power, feasting wildly.

His strength was constantly draining away!

“What is this?!” Ban Qing couldn’t help but stagger back several steps, staring at his body in horror and shouting, “What is this now?!”

Since meeting Yang Kai, he had already asked this question several times.

For someone born and raised in the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, the methods and items Yang Kai displayed today were simply beyond his understanding.

Most crucially, even though Ban Qing didn’t recognize the Soul-Devouring Worm, the moment he saw it, a primal fear welled up from deep within his soul—an instinctive terror, like a frog meeting a snake or a rabbit encountering an eagle…

As he roared, Ban Qing’s body trembled, forming an invisible field of energy around himself.

The Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms that hadn’t yet entered his body were shaken off by this move.

However, the pure Divine Soul energy flowing from Ban Qing’s wound was the most delicious food for the Soul-Devouring Worms. How could they let it go?

Without waiting for Yang Kai’s command, they gathered again, forming a cloud of insects that enveloped Ban Qing.

A scene of utter despair unfolded before Ban Qing’s eyes.

His Emperor Realm defensive field proved ineffective against these insects. They clung to the outside, gnawing away, and soon chewed a hole in the perfect barrier, once again covering him and burrowing into his body through the wound.

“Sacred Insects!” Ban Qing suddenly seemed to remember something. His face changed dramatically as he screamed in terror, “These are the Sacred Insects!”

As he shouted, a look of misery appeared in his eyes.

Even when facing the Soul-Severing Blade, he had never felt so helpless. But now, confronted by the Soul-Devouring Worms, this Emperor Realm expert was utterly despairing.
