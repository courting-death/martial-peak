## Chapter 1454 — Break Free

After all, Xue Yue possessed a rare constitution, the Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body! Such a constitution was coveted even by Void King Realm experts, because if anyone could obtain her primordial yin, any man would experience a tremendous increase in cultivation with no hidden risks.

That was why she had to live as a man, and why the Hengluo Commerce Guild concealed her true sex; within the entire Hengluo Commerce Guild, those who knew this secret could be counted on one hand.

And one of them was Yang Kai.

How could Yang Kai allow Xue Yue to recognize him? The moment he saw her, Yang Kai immediately slipped into an unnoticed corner, contracted his aura, and lowered his presence.

Over there, Xue Yue stood guarded by a host of Third-Stage masters, her smile as enchanting as ever—enough to make any woman scream in envy and lose her mind.

“So this is the Imperial Garden?” she murmured as she glanced at the towering palace.

“Replying to the Third Young Master, based on the intelligence gathered, this is indeed the Imperial Garden,” a voluptuous beauty beside Xue Yue answered respectfully.

“Hm, since we're here, then let's go in.” Xue Yue gave no further words and led those at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm toward the Imperial Garden's main gate.

No one dared to stop them!

Not to mention the number and strength of Xue Yue's party, the mere name of the Hengluo Commerce Guild carried tremendous intimidation—who in their right mind would dare oppose them here?

So Xue Yue and her group easily passed through the battlefield before the Imperial Garden, vanishing within the main gate in no more than a dozen breaths.

After their figures disappeared, the battlefield once again rang with the whoosh of cutting air—some were using the fleeting calm to rush into the Imperial Garden.

And there were quite a few, around twenty to thirty, each showing off their movement skills and streaking forward as multicolored lights.

Yang Kai was mixed in among them—when opportunity knocks, one must seize it. Although charging into the Imperial Garden now risked running straight into Xue Yue, this was an excellent chance; once the fighting resumed, passing through here would be extremely difficult.

Besides, he was not alone—others were rushing in as well, and they could provide cover for him.

In an instant Yang Kai surged to the Imperial Garden's main gate and, with those trying to enter, pushed inside, slipping through that radiant portal.

His vision blurred; there seemed to be a trace of spatial power. When Yang Kai's sight cleared he found himself inside a complex of buildings—pavilions and towers dotted the scene, white jade paths crisscrossing everywhere.

He had made it in! Yang Kai rejoiced.

The last time he had entered the Imperial Garden's interior the scene had been much the same—this was undoubtedly the Imperial Garden.

But before Yang Kai could show his delight, his neck involuntarily drew in.

The group led by Xue Yue, who had entered ahead, had not gone far; instead they stood ahead as if observing something.

They did not move. The warriors who had barged in under the Hengluo Commerce Guild's intimidation dared not act rashly either; after entering they all stood still, faces showing awkwardness.

Yang Kai was mixed among them, his heart in turmoil, silently praying that Xue Yue would not recognize him.

Thinking this, Yang Kai remained rooted to the spot.

But fate had it otherwise—Xue Yue, seemingly somewhat bored, let her beautiful eyes sweep over the newcomers.

Yang Kai's face darkened; knowing he could no longer hide peacefully, he hurriedly shifted his body and dashed to the side before she could see his face.

That movement instantly became the focus of everyone's attention.

Xue Yue naturally turned her gaze; when she saw that somewhat familiar profile she first showed a flicker of puzzlement, then wild joy, and then furious wrath as she roared, “Stand still for this Young Master!”

How could Yang Kai possibly listen to her? Not only did he ignore her words—he sped up instead, in the blink of an eye darting a hundred zhang away, leaving Xue Yue with nothing but a dashing view of his back.

“Third Young Master?” the voluptuous beauty looked at Xue Yue in doubt.

“Bring him back to me!” Xue Yue said with a sullen face, issuing the order coldly.

Although the beauty did not know why Xue Yue would fuss over a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior, she did not ask; her figure flickered as she gave chase after Yang Kai.

After the beauty chased off, Xue Yue frowned in thought, an odd expression crossing her face. Though it had only been a fleeting glimpse, that profile had indeed felt familiar—the face of a man she had resented to the point of sleepless nights.

However, the world was vast, and there were too many people who merely looked alike. Since Xue Yue hadn’t seen his face clearly, she didn’t dare be certain.

The main point was that the man's cultivation was First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

When they had parted years ago he had been only Third Stage of the Saint Realm; could he have advanced so far in just over a decade? Xue Yue had her doubts—after all, even as the Hengluo Commerce Guild's Third Young Master and bearing a special constitution with abundant cultivation resources and excellent conditions, she herself had only broken from Third Stage of the Saint King Realm to Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

And it had been only a recent breakthrough, not even stabilized.

If he truly possessed such capability, then his aptitude would be utterly unfathomable.

It was precisely that First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivation that made Xue Yue hesitate to be certain.

Yet she would never forget that man, even after hundreds or thousands of years; every midnight when memories returned she would gnash her teeth with hatred—back then, when she tried to keep him, he had rejected her without a second thought.

Was she not beautiful? Did she not have status?

Certainly not—in looks Xue Yue was confident she was unmatched, and in status few across the Star Domain could compare to her, yet even so she had been unable to hold onto a mere Third Stage of the Saint Realm man.

Back then, when she asked him to stay and assist her, that bastard had refused without a second's hesitation!

That left Xue Yue feeling deeply humiliated. She secretly swore revenge; one day she would capture him, imprison him, take him wherever she went to show him her glory and make him regret his decision, to let him know how blind he had been.

Although before others Xue Yue presented the image of a courteous, refined gentleman, at heart she was still a woman.

A woman's thoughts can sometimes be absurd and unreasonable.

“We'll go take a look too.” Xue Yue's emotions surged and she could not wait in place—moments later she followed the direction the beauty and Yang Kai had gone. The other Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm members exchanged glances, unsure what trick their Third Young Master was up to.

Yet none dared disobey Xue Yue's orders; one by one they obediently followed.

Meanwhile, not long after Yang Kai dashed away he sensed a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert tracking him from behind. Although he was not overly afraid of such an expert given his current abilities, the pursuer was not alone; if the chasers managed to entangle him, he might be captured by Xue Yue.

If that happened, he would be doomed. Yang Kai's impressions of Xue Yue were complicated—there was no great hatred between them, and in fact he had once saved her by concocting a Pill when Profound Yin Moon Water had invaded her body.

But in the end... he had taken advantage of her quite a bit. On that Dead Star they lay naked and entwined; what could be touched was touched, what could be seen was seen.

Although at the time it had been out of necessity—without doing so he would have surely died—still, it was not something a man should have done.

Any woman would not let such matters pass, especially one of high status with strong pride; she certainly would not let it go.

He had fled without explanation, so of course she would bear resentment.

In short, if she caught him he would be finished.

So upon learning there were pursuers, Yang Kai pushed himself to fly deeper into the Imperial Garden!

During the dash a golden light flashed at his left eye as he constantly scanned his surroundings.

The World-Ending Demon Eye, the Great Demon God's innate talent, possessed the power to pierce illusions; using it now undoubtedly gave Yang Kai tremendous aid.

He sought a usable sealing formation.

There were many sealing arrays within the Imperial Garden. When he and Fei Zhi Tu had delved here before, Yang Kai had felt this deeply; but this time, with the Imperial Garden opened to the entire Star Domain and many entering, most of the arrays had been broken.

As he ran, he found not a single usable formation or array—the few traces he did see had already been destroyed.

As time passed, the pursuers drew ever closer and Yang Kai grew desperate.

Fortunately, at that moment he finally discovered something: under the observation of the World-Ending Demon Eye, a large area ahead seemed to be shrouded by a formation of considerable power.

Without hesitation Yang Kai shot toward it, cautiously skirting the edge and slipping through.

A moment later the voluptuous beauty arrived but failed to notice and directly charged into the formation; in the instant it was triggered she was wrapped inside, unable to move an inch.

Yang Kai stood there listening for a while; from within came bursts of the woman's cries, interspersed with strong surges of energy—he immediately knew his stratagem had worked.

He let out a laugh and changed direction, flying off the other way.

For the time being, he should be safe.

The Imperial Garden was vast; as long as he remained cautious he would likely avoid another encounter with Xue Yue. Thinking of that, Yang Kai relaxed somewhat, though he did not drop his guard, continuing to probe his surroundings as he flew forward so as not to accidentally fall into a formation himself.
