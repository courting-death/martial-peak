## Chapter 1741 — One Act Ends, Another Begins

This time Gu Jianxin had departed from the Sword Alliance’s main star for Qingmu Star on business; Gu Jianxin himself traveled with two disciples, and unexpectedly they were swept into that kind of struggle and nearly perished.

After saying that, He Zao did not pry into Yang Kai’s experiences over the years; she knew what questions were appropriate for her position.

Yang Kai nodded faintly and said, “By the way, how much do you know about your Young Alliance Master, Gu Jianxin?”

“Young Alliance Master?” He Zao paused. “Eldest Brother, do you want to learn more about the Young Alliance Master?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai found her bright intelligence pleasing. “Tell me what you can comfortably say; if something’s inconvenient to speak of, forget it.”

He Zao smiled slightly. “What I know isn’t much, and there’s nothing really inconvenient to say. The Young Alliance Master is, one could say, the most gifted talent the Sword Alliance has seen in a thousand years. Though he is not yet sixty by true age this year, he already possesses the peak cultivation of the Origin Returning Realm. Rumor has it that with three to five years’ time he can break into the Void King Realm!”

Yang Kai sipped his tea and nodded, using his eyes to prompt her to go on.

He had already learned this situation earlier from Liu Dong.

“The Young Alliance Master is modest and loyal, the heir the Alliance placed great hopes in. Not only is his cultivation profound, his strength is likewise formidable; among the young generation in this Star Domain, only Third Young Master Xue Yue of the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s and Zi Donglai of Purple Star could rival him.”

“Is that so…” Hearing this, another figure suddenly surfaced in Yang Kai’s mind.

Xu Binbai!

The interesting young man they had met outside the Blood Prison on Cuiwei Star that day! It was said he was the disciple of a Void King Realm expert called Wudao. That very Wudao’s cultivation was so high even Star Lord Luo Hai of Cuiwei Star feared him. He was accorded the respectful title Lord Wudao!

Wudao was a genuine Third-Stage Void King Realm expert — one of those ancient monsters who had lived for countless years, rarely seen and shrouded in mystery like a dragon that shows its head but not its tail!

A disciple personally taught by such a figure would probably not be inferior to Gu Jianxin, Xue Yue, or that Zi Donglai—perhaps even slightly superior. The thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind and then passed without being spoken.

He Zao had dwelt long within the Sword Alliance; her strength was not high and the things she had contact with were narrow, so her horizon was naturally limited.

“The Young Alliance Master’s reputation within the Sword Alliance is excellent. If it were otherwise, Master would not have chosen to follow him. Yes, the Young Alliance Master also has left and Right Sword Servants; it was said these Sword Servants had trained alongside the Young Alliance Master since childhood and are like brothers and sisters.”

“More than just brothers and sisters, I imagine.” Yang Kai chuckled.

When those left and Right Sword Servants looked at Gu Jianxin, the affection in their eyes was obvious—almost dripping with intensity.

He Zao pursed her red lips. A flush crossed her face and she bit the hem of her sleeve with her fingers, saying nothing on that point, and continued: “The Left Sword Servant is called Lingyue, the Right Sword Servant is called Anxing. The Young Alliance Master and his two Sword Servants cultivated a secret art of the sun, moon, and stars together. The three acting in concert could produce combat power far exceeding their individual stages. Even without their assistance, however, the Young Alliance Master’s personal combat power is extremely strong; an ordinary Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could not be his match.”

Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

A warrior’s strength could often be judged at a glance. Gu Jianxin gave Yang Kai the impression of someone powerful.

He belonged to the elite among elites!

“That’s about all I know,” He Zao finished, her beautiful eyes turning to Yang Kai as if awaiting his next instruction.

“So why did Gu Jianxin go to Qingmu Star this time?”

“I don’t know that. We only acted on orders; until the Young Alliance Master announced the destination we did not even know where we were going.” He Zao shook her head.

“Eldest Brother, you ask so much—do you mean to make an enemy of the Young Alliance Master?” He Miao asked with some worry.

Yang Kai laughed heartily and shook his head. “Not at all. I have no interest or conflict with Gu Jianxin; why would I make an enemy of him? He seems a decent person. I’m merely aboard his warship now and naturally want to learn more about him. Don’t be so anxious.”

“Oh.” He Miao relaxed considerably, patting her lofty chest with small hands as if to say she had been frightened to death.

Sisters like He Zao and He Miao were only Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warriors; though young and perhaps future pillars of the Sword Alliance, their current cultivation was insufficient to reach the highest levels of intelligence, so they could not access top-tier information.

To them it boiled down to three words.

Carry out orders!

No need to ask, no need to think—when orders from above arrived, they simply obeyed. Even if the assignment promised death, they would steel themselves and go.

This was the sorrow of lower-tier warriors in a great power: they appeared to enjoy excellent protection, but had lost a portion of their freedom. If Yang Kai truly intended to make an enemy of Gu Jianxin, He Zao and He Miao would be in a difficult position.

Afterwards Yang Kai spoke with He Zao and He Miao a while longer before sending them away.

“Eldest Brother…” He Zao suddenly called out as she left.

“Anything else?” Yang Kai looked at her.

He Zao bit her lip, hesitant, but in the end she shook her head. “Nothing. Rest well. If you need anything, just tell us—we’re staying in the adjoining fifth chamber.”

“All right!” Yang Kai nodded with some puzzlement.

Having sent the sisters off, Yang Kai stood in place, dazed for a while. He was certain He Zao had something she wanted to tell him but, for some reason, had not said it.

Admittedly, Yang Kai and the two sisters had only interacted twice over these decades, but after sharing hardships together once on the Floating Continent they had formed some rapport.

This chance encounter had further fermented that bond, making it richer.

If He Zao truly had something she wanted Yang Kai to help with, he would not refuse. Unfortunately she perhaps had reservations she did not voice, and Yang Kai was not about to press her.

“Sister, earlier did you want Eldest Brother Yang Kai to put in a good word for us?” Back in her chamber, He Miao asked He Zao.

“Yes.” He Zao inclined her head slightly and whispered, “Now only Eldest Brother Yang Kai can help us. Not even Master can solve this.”

“But why didn’t you say it? Eldest Brother is a good person—if you’d said it, he surely wouldn’t have stood idly by.”

“He wouldn’t stand idly by…” He Zao sat on the bedside, “but it’s really not his concern. It’s our own matter.”

“Sister…” He Miao crouched down and laid her head on He Zao’s lap, lamenting, “If things go on like this, we will truly have to—”

He Zao reached out, stroking He Miao’s hair; a trace of sorrow crossed her pretty face. “Ah, if not for Master Qin speaking up on our behalf back then, Master and we might not have escaped punishment, perhaps we wouldn’t be alive now. That person is Lord Qin’s son; precisely because of that fact Master could not refuse Lord Qin’s proposal. Consider it…repayment. Over the years Lord Qin has shown us much care.”

“I won’t stand for it.” He Miao suddenly rose, her temperament fierce, fists clenched as she declared, “If the day truly comes, I will slaughter that brat Qin Qiyang.”

He Zao was startled and stared at He Miao in alarm, scolding softly, “Don’t speak such nonsense.”

He Miao pouted and fell silent, crawling back to rest against her sister’s thigh.

In the adjoining chamber Yang Kai had only just turned to sit in meditation when there was a knock at the door.

This made him frown slightly. With some displeasure, he rose to his feet and opened the door—only for a beautiful yet flustered face to immediately come into view.

Yang Kai was taken aback.

“May I come in?” the visitor asked softly, glancing about with furtive looks as if afraid of being seen.

What in the world? Yang Kai was even more bewildered. However, seeing that the other party clearly had something difficult to speak of, he didn’t refuse — instead, he stepped aside. At once, she swept past him in a rush of fragrant wind and darted into the room.

After closing the door Yang Kai turned to look at the woman and asked suspiciously, “Lady Yue, do you need me for something?”

The visitor was none other than Yue Xi, the Master of He Zao and He Miao!

Yang Kai was bewildered—the sisters had just left his side and immediately their Master arrived. What was going on? An onlooker might think there was something indecent between him and the disciples, which was far from the truth.

“I pay my respects, Young Master Yang,” Yue Xi said with a light bow, opening her lips: “I thank Young Master Yang for saving my life before—”

“Say it plainly,” Yang Kai replied coolly.

Yue Xi’s expression tightened, then she forced a bitter smile, bit her lips and thought a moment before speaking bluntly: “I have come to implore Young Master Yang to show great mercy and save He Zao and He Miao from their suffering.”

“What’s wrong with them?” Yang Kai frowned. “They seemed fine to me—no signs of injury or poison. What is there for me to save them from?”

“It isn’t injury or poison,” Yue Xi shook her head. “It’s just…they—one of them may be forced to marry a man they do not know, and he is not a proper man!”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and stared at Yue Xi.

That oppressive gaze put pressure on Yue Xi; her face grew unnatural, awkward, and ashamed, but after a moment she raised her eyes to meet Yang Kai’s.

“Sit and tell me,” Yang Kai unexpectedly invited, then went to the side and poured a cup of tea.

“Thank you.” Yue Xi breathed a little and took a seat as instructed.

“I didn’t quite understand—explain it carefully.” Yang Kai sat down opposite and asked.

Yue Xi said, “It was my fault for not explaining clearly. The matter is like this.”

As she recounted the tale, Yang Kai finally understood the cause.

The matter was, astonishingly, tied to the past. When Yang Kai and Yue Xi had first met, she had been a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and already qualified to command a Saint King-Grade Warship on not-too-dangerous Star Domain missions.

During one such mission the Sword Alliance suffered heavy losses; only Yue Xi and her three disciples escaped. After returning to the Sword Alliance’s main star they faced an irreconcilable calamity.
