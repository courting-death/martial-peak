## Chapter 1962 — Heaven Devouring Battle Art

Yang Kai had only been in the Biyu Sect for four months, yet in that time he had already been thrown into the Bone Prison twice.

But the circumstances were entirely different — the first time he’d been dragged back, while the second was merely a punishment.

He and Liu Qianyun were locked in one cell, while Zhou Yi, Chu Fei and two others were confined in another cell across a corridor; even in the darkness Yang Kai could still feel the spiteful glares cast from the opposite side.

Yang Kai pretended not to notice.

At that moment he sat cross-legged on the cold, damp floor, his brow creased into a knot.

He could not stay in the Biyu Sect any longer; he and Liu Qianyun had only joined the sect temporarily out of necessity, felt no sense of belonging here, and with this incident now happening, Yang Kai had no desire to linger.

If he stayed any longer, one day someone might come to make trouble again. Yang Kai was well aware his strength was not high; he could not rely on luck every time to escape danger. If an accident occurred even once, his Martial Dao would likely end there.

Especially after seeing Yan Xiuran and Zhou Yi whispering furtively for a long while, then sneering at him before leaving, Yang Kai knew they were surely scheming something — perhaps trying to use tricks to get him killed right here.

Yang Kai was not willing to sit and wait for death.

Right now, Protector Bian and Kou Wu were both absent from the sect; if they kept their hands clean and handled things properly, no obvious flaws would be exposed.

Besides, even if Bian Yuqing returned, with that woman’s capricious temperament it was uncertain whether she would stick her neck out for him. When she had thrown him to the Ice Cliff back then, it likely had not been from any kindness — it was a way to test his potential!

If he died, she would certainly not care; if he lived, she would pay him a little more attention. But that did not mean she was kind.

After making up his mind, Yang Kai quietly began to contact an expert in the place.

"Senior, Senior Wu Mengchuan..."

Yang Kai kept calling softly.

To his surprise, there was no response at first.

The first time he had been thrown into the Bone Prison, this Wu Mengchuan had come to him voluntarily and offered to teach a Secret Technique to dispel the restriction inside his body. At that time Yang Kai did not understand the Biyu Sect well and did not dare act rashly, fearing he would be used as a pawn.

Now, if he wanted to break free of the Biyu Sect, he had to rely on Wu Mengchuan’s ability.

If the man really was Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, letting him out to create a commotion would be an excellent option; Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun could use the chaos to escape.

But the other party was silent, which made Yang Kai wonder whether the Biyu Sect had transferred him away, or whether he might already be dead.

He did not lose heart; instead he continued to try.

Finally, after trying for a full two hours, a hidden Divine Sense fluctuation leisurely rolled out and conveyed a thought to Yang Kai.

"So it’s you, brat — you’ve been locked up again?" Wu Mengchuan sounded very surprised.

Yang Kai crooked his mouth. "Senior, don’t mock me. But why have you not replied for so long? I thought you were no longer here."

Wu Mengchuan's laugh drifted over: "The Soul Power I can recover each day is scant — it only sustains me for half an hour, so I dare not call it forth lightly."

"I see!" Yang Kai nodded slightly, not doubting it.

"What do you want, brat? Have you decided to cooperate with me?" Wu Mengchuan’s tone grew oddly excited. Having waited here so many years, he had finally met a suitable helper and did not want to miss the chance.

If he missed it, whether he could ever escape the Bone Prison in his lifetime was uncertain.

Yang Kai pondered, then said, "Cooperating is fine; I can help you leave here. But... what can you offer me? I won’t work for nothing."

"What do you want? I won’t lie — I have nothing to my name now. Even if I promise you, I may not be able to give you anything. But if you trust me, once I’m out I can give you whatever you want!" Wu Mengchuan said in a low voice.

Yang Kai sneered, unconcerned. "Then how about this, Senior: do you have any decent Secret Technique you can teach me? Just teach me one."

"Want a Secret Technique?" Wu Mengchuan repeated, then fell silent.

Yang Kai was not impatient; he waited quietly.

He had only asked casually — even if Wu Mengchuan gave him nothing, he would still have to cooperate to survive. Asking was a gamble, but from the other’s silence it seemed there might be a chance.

This made Yang Kai realize Wu Mengchuan was likely desperate to leave, and that he — Yang Kai — was indispensable to those plans. Otherwise the man would not be taking it so seriously.

Should he try to demand more? The thought flashed through his mind, but he quickly discarded it.

The other’s strength was so great that if he angered him, once free the man might very well make him the first target.

After a while, Wu Mengchuan made up his mind. He sneered and said, "Very well. Since you want a secret method, I’ll teach you the most powerful technique I know. With this method’s help, one day reaching the Emperor Realm won’t be a dream! Pay attention."

With that, a current of thought surged into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness like a tide; Yang Kai loosened the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness and accepted it all.

Within that rush of thought were two secret arts: one a method to dispel the sealing within his body, the other the boon Wu Mengchuan had bestowed upon Yang Kai.

Yang Kai immediately began to examine them.

Wu Mengchuan’s voice came again, tinged with inexplicable fatigue: "Brat, I’m counting on you. Get that restriction removed quickly and help me escape."

After saying that, he fell silent; it seemed the earlier exertion had exhausted the Divine Sense he had accumulated. Yang Kai called again, but he received no further response.

Yang Kai then began to study the two techniques Wu Mengchuan had taught. The one for removing the restriction was not profound; after a few cursory readings he grasped the idea. All that remained was to follow the energy circulation pattern in the method to gradually break the restriction within his body.

The other technique, however, had a very strange name.

Heaven Devouring Battle Art!

Yang Kai had no time to ponder deeply and instead skimmed through it rapidly.

Before long his expression grew extremely shocked.

He had not expected Wu Mengchuan to casually hand over a true Secret Technique. Even though the man had said he would give his most powerful method, Yang Kai had not taken him seriously.

Who would freely teach their greatest technique to a stranger for no reason?

But now it seemed Wu Mengchuan’s words might very well be true.

This Heaven Devouring Battle Art was less a mere Secret Technique and more a full cultivation art, and an extremely profound one at that. Practiced with it, one could — like a Spirit-Eating Yao Worm — consume anything in the world that contained Spiritual Qi, forcibly seizing that Spiritual Qi for oneself and growing strong at an astonishing speed.

The method was divided into several parts, and the deepest layer even contained elements of the Emperor Realm.

Yang Kai’s eyes nearly popped out.

Inclusion of the Emperor Realm meant the Heaven Devouring Battle Art was a cultivation art that could truly be cultivated to the Emperor Realm and even beyond; such a technique’s value was incalculable, a treasure worth shedding blood for even in the Star Realm.

Yang Kai was shaken to his core and double-checked several times to ensure he had not misread it.

Shock aside, his mind brimmed with suspicion.

Why would Wu Mengchuan give such a supreme technique so freely? Even if he needed Yang Kai’s help, this generosity seemed excessive — what hidden malice might he harbor?

It wasn’t that Yang Kai distrusted the man out of petty spite, but the whole affair did not feel right no matter how he thought about it.

He guessed either this method required a special type of person to cultivate, or that even if he could cultivate it, it carried great drawbacks.

He tended toward the latter explanation.

As for what those drawbacks might be, he had no way of guessing.

Putting the Heaven Devouring Battle Art aside for the moment, Yang Kai began to comprehend the restriction-removal technique.

The restriction on him had been placed by Senior Brother Pang, a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator; special tricks were required to lift it. If one forced it, the restriction could lash back and cause harm.

Yang Kai was no novice; he understood such common sense.

He had prepared himself mentally for a long struggle.

What he never expected was that, following Wu Mengchuan’s prescribed energy circulation, in less than an hour the restriction showed signs of loosening and his power slowly began to recover and flow.

This discovery astonished Yang Kai; he secretly wondered whether Wu Mengchuan might actually be a Biyu Sect's master — otherwise how could he be so familiar with the method to remove such a restriction and teach a way to break it so swiftly?

But if he were truly a Biyu Sect master, why would he be imprisoned in the deepest part of the Bone Prison?

Yang Kai could not make sense of it, and he did not ponder too deeply; the faster the restriction was removed, the better.

The surging fluctuation of power within him did not escape the notice of Liu Qianyun, who sat nearby.

When she sensed it, Liu Qianyun immediately covered her red lips with her hand, staring at Yang Kai in shock; she could not believe he could forcefully assault the restriction placed by a Dao Origin Realm expert and achieve such results.

To avoid arousing suspicion, Liu Qianyun moved in front of Yang Kai and sat cross-legged, using her body to shield him.

But this could only delay discovery for so long.

As Yang Kai’s power fluctuations grew more obvious, Zhou Yi and the others across the way finally noticed.

One by one they rose from the ground and cast suspicious, paranoid looks in Yang Kai’s direction.
