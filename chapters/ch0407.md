## Chapter 407 — Regret?

The grand and spacious hall of the Yang Family’s Elder Hall was adorned with thick, soft carpets. The walls were intricately carved with scenic paintings, and the central incense burner emitted calming incense that soothed the mind. The warm atmosphere was complemented by the gems embedded in the ceiling, twinkling like stars.

Several old men with graying hair wore simple robes, either sitting or standing, some studying chess strategies while others pondered over the mysteries of a cultivation method, finding joy in their pursuits.

These elders appeared ordinary, their energy and spirit subdued to the utmost, bearing no significant distinction from regular old men. However, each possessed exceptional skills and renowned reputations.

In the center, Yang Zhen sat in a chair. Though he had passed seventy, he still appeared youthful, with a hint of vigor reminiscent of his younger days.

As one of the heads of the Elder Hall, with his age making it inconvenient for him to roam about, he couldn’t charge into battles to contribute to the Yang Family like during his youth. Thus, Yang Zhen had long settled in the Elder Hall, managing various affairs alongside other aging elders.

At this moment, Yang Zhen lowered his eyelids, appearing quite listless as he listened to a young man recounting his experiences.

After quite some time, the youth finally finished speaking, looking expectantly at Yang Zhen, awaiting his response.

Slowly opening his eyes, a brilliant light shone within those seemingly murky orbs. Yang Zhen shot the youth a cold glance, his face showing signs of impatience.

“Useless thing!” Yang Zhen snorted. “After being away for these years, is this all you’ve brought back to the Yang Family? You think this worthless garbage can win the allegiance of blood servants? You’re even more muddled than I am.”

The youth blushed with indignation from Yang Zhen’s scolding.

“Go back. I’ll record your contributions, but they’re insufficient to exchange for any blood servants,” Yang Zhen waved his hand dismissively. “Wait until you’ve achieved enough merit before coming again. Little do you know, the contest for the family succession is approaching. I suggest you give up early to avoid becoming a laughingstock.”

The youth left in dejection, sighing helplessly, but he still seemed reluctant to accept defeat as he pleaded, “Elder, can I at least exchange for one of the weaker ones…”

Before he could finish, he was interrupted by Yang Zhen: “Not enough is not enough. Stop whining and get lost!”

With a furious roar, an invisible wave of pressure struck the youth, directly expelling him from the Elder Hall.

The entire Elder Hall buzzed with activity, but the few bored, white-haired elders remained unperturbed. They acted as if they were deaf, continuing with their own matters without paying any attention.

Outside the hall, the youth picked himself up, a look of humiliation on his face, his cheeks flushed as he angrily departed.

Just as he reached the door, Yang Kai witnessed this scene and felt an indescribable emotion arise in his heart.

That youth was Yang Tie, the third-ranked youth of the Yang Family, and regarded as Yang Kai’s third brother.

When the family allowed blood servants to participate in the succession conflict, the younger generation promptly sprang into action, hoping to exchange their experiences from the outside world for the loyalty of blood servants.

However, it now seemed that Yang Tie had gained little of value during these years, which was why he had been driven out by the elders.

“Third brother is finished,” a voice reached Yang Kai’s ears, carrying a tone of regret.

Following the voice, Yang Kai saw Yang Zhao standing nearby, a hint of sadness on his face as he watched Yang Tie’s retreating figure, shaking his head.

“Second brother!” Yang Kai greeted him.

“Kai,” Yang Zhao smiled.

Yang Kai turned his gaze to another person beside Yang Zhao. This individual stood straight as a sword, his calm demeanor exuding an unshakeable composure. His expression remained unchanged, and only when Yang Zhao called out to Yang Kai did he glance this way.

“Eldest brother!” Yang Kai’s expression grew serious.

The only young expert of the Yang Family’s younger generation to reach the Divine Roaming Realm was none other than Yang Wei, the eldest brother!

“Kai?” Yang Wei looked surprised at Yang Kai’s greeting. Uncontrollably, his True Yuan fluctuated in response, a reaction he typically experienced only under pressure.

His newly cultivated divine sense scanned Yang Kai and found him merely at the Eighth Stage of True Yuan Realm, causing him to frown in secret, puzzled as to why Yang Kai had triggered his True Yuan to fluctuate.

“After several years, little brother Kai has grown to this extent,” Yang Wei nodded lightly, a trace of approval visible in his eyes.

However, as soon as he spoke, a look of shock and alarm crossed his face.

Five or six years ago, this youngest brother had been incapable of cultivation, just an ordinary person unable to lift a chicken. Yet upon their reunion, he had reached the eighth stage of the True Yuan Realm!

Though Yang Kai was two minor stages below him, Yang Wei had been cultivating for seven or eight years longer. It had slipped his mind at first.

Yang Wei finally realized that Yang Kai’s ability to invoke pressure on him wasn’t without reason. If given some time, he would surely surpass Yang Wei one day!

“Are you here to report your contributions as well?” Yang Zhao asked with a light laugh. Yang Kai slightly nodded, bitterly smiling, “There’s nothing I can do; the family has mandated this, so I must comply.”

“Haha!” Yang Zhao laughed heartily, patting Yang Kai’s shoulder: “Otherwise, do you think the family would have so many treasures? They’re all things we brought back from outside.”

“These resources belong to the family; one day, you will need them yourselves.” Yang Wei’s demeanor was naturally cold. In Yang Kai’s memory, he had never smiled, rarely speaking, and always appeared serious. However, his methods were swift and decisive.

Hearing this, Yang Zhao and Yang Kai promptly ceased their discussion on the matter.

“Are you intending to exchange those two blood servants you brought back? They seem quite attentive to you,” Yang Zhao inquired somewhat deliberately.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “There are others I have in mind.”

Yang Zhao was taken aback, seemingly not expecting him to forgo Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

However, Yang Kai clearly did not wish to elaborate further. He turned and asked, “Where’s fifth brother? How come I don’t see him?”

Yang Zhao and Yang Kang were biological brothers, typically inseparable.

Yang Wei snorted lightly, “With me here, does he dare to show up?”

Yang Zhao and Yang Kai exchanged glances, instinctively retreating slightly. Not only Yang Kang, but all their brothers held a deep respect for this naturally cold-faced eldest brother.

This reverence wasn’t solely due to his age.

“I’ll go in first,” Yang Wei indicated to the two and walked into the Elder Hall with his hands clasped behind his back.

Not long after, he exited again, striding away.

Yang Zhao sighed, “Eldest brother still isn’t fond of talking; even the brothers who want to get closer to him can’t.”

“It’s just his personality,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, secretly admiring Yang Wei’s straightforward nature. No excessive words, no ambiguity; he spoke and acted with complete clarity.

“This second brother will enter as well. Little brother Kai, wait a moment,” Yang Zhao said.

“Understood.”

After some time, Yang Zhao emerged with a broad smile, clearly satisfied with his visit. Once he exited the Elder Hall, Yang Kai also stepped inside.

Upon seeing Yang Kai enter, Yang Zhen fixed his gaze intensely upon him. Once Yang Kai approached and saluted, Yang Zhen chuckled, “I remember you, kid. Last time you exchanged a set of mystery-grade martial skills for a golden feather eagle.”

“Indeed,” Yang Kai lightly nodded. The previous exchange for the golden feather eagle had been facilitated by Yang Zhen, so it was only natural he remembered.

Laughing with a hint of schadenfreude, Yang Zhen remarked, “Regretting it now, huh? Hahaha! I knew you would regret it. Exchanging a set of mystery-grade martial skills for a hardly useful beast was indeed a bad deal! That could have bought you a chance to win a blood servant’s loyalty!”

It seemed he found pleasure in the notion of Yang Kai’s regret.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, smiling enigmatically, “No regrets. Besides, regretting it is of no use; it only adds to one’s troubles.”

Yang Zhen snorted, curling his lip, “Stubborn as a dead duck!”

He clearly assumed Yang Kai was just pretending to be generous while deeply regretting his decision.

“Well then, I am curious to see what kind of surprises you will bring me this time!” Yang Zhen's hands remained tucked in his sleeves, his expression indifferent. “So tell me, how many blood servants do you wish to exchange for?”

“A maximum of two, that’s all!” 

Yang Zhen’s smile gradually faded. He fixed a cold stare upon Yang Kai, his countenance turning serious. Even the seemingly deaf white-haired elders paused their tasks and turned to observe him.

In an instant, every gaze in the room focused on Yang Kai. The old men were initially surprised, then they all displayed expressions of interest, leaning in to hear more.

The young masters of the Yang Family, when training overseas, typically only engaged with first-rate forces, whose resources were limited. Access to worthy treasures for the Yang Family’s young masters was scarce.

To exchange for a blood servant’s loyalty, one would need at least a set of mystery-grade martial skills or three sets of upper-level heaven-grade martial skills.

Last time, Yang Kai had already spent a set of mystery-grade martial skills. Now, he seemed to want to exchange for two blood servants.

That meant he would need at least two more sets of mystery-grade martial skills. Did he have them?

It was absolutely impossible! If mystery-grade martial skills were so easily obtainable, their value wouldn’t hold.

Everyone within the room didn’t believe Yang Kai could achieve his desires, viewing him as someone unaware of the rules, overestimating his chips.

Each one donned an expression of watching a spectacle.

After a long while, Yang Zhen scoffed dismissively, “Then tell me what your chips are; I’ll assess whether you can exchange for two blood servants’ loyalty.”

Yang Kai slightly nodded, reaching into his bosom and retrieving two flawless jade pieces, placing them on the table before Yang Zhen.

Yang Zhen frowned at him, revealing a hint of impatience. With a cold snort, he withdrew his hand from his sleeves, and without any indication of movement, picked up one of the jades, probing with his divine sense.
