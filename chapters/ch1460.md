## Chapter 1460 — Who Is the Hunter

The last time Yang Kai entered the Imperial Garden, he had already encountered this little creature. He knew its true body was formless and capable of transforming into all things—so although that white rabbit appeared delicate and crystal-clear, in truth it was exceedingly ferocious.

Those two women of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, while highly capable and able to perform beyond themselves in such special terrain, still found that the Heaven and Earth Spirit in white rabbit form held the terrain advantage.

And that advantage was even more pronounced than theirs!

After all, this Heaven and Earth Spirit is itself the concentrated cold qi of this place; after tens of thousands of years of gathering it gained spirit and evolved step by step—this world within the Ice Path is practically its own backyard.

Therefore, even with the two women cooperating, they were powerless against the Heaven and Earth Spirit and instead were constrained at every turn.

"This is quite the coincidence," Yang Kai muttered with a curl at the corner of his mouth as he watched the two women.

"Do you know them?" Biluo asked with curiosity.

"No, but I know where they come from," Yang Kai answered offhandedly, leaving Biluo puzzled.

Yang Kai truly did not know the two women, but from their attire and the embroidered patterns on their clothes they were likely experts from Ice Heart Valley on Chi Lan Star. He had only dealt with Ice Heart Valley a few days earlier—how could he be mistaken?

It seemed Ice Heart Valley had split its forces—one party exploring outside the Imperial Garden and another inside; not putting all eggs in one basket was a rather wise tactic.

Ice Heart Valley cultivators all practiced ice-type methods and secret arts, so the temptation the Heaven and Earth Spirit posed to them is obvious. It was likely for that reason they risked engaging the white rabbit; yet now they rode a tiger and could not dismount, unable to extricate themselves and forced to grit their teeth and endure.

Right now it was ideal to sit back and watch the tigers fight. The two Ice Heart Valley women were no weaklings—although they could not defeat the Heaven and Earth Spirit, they could still give it trouble. Yang Kai could bide his time and seize an opportunity to strike, subduing the Heaven and Earth Spirit in one blow, or let the remnant soul of the Ice Phoenix swallow it.

As for whether those two women lived or died, it mattered little to Yang Kai; they were merely strangers crossing paths, with no ties, and he had no mood to rescue them from peril.

Having settled on that, Yang Kai cast a glance at Biluo, signaling her to remain steady.

Biluo understood. She nodded lightly, calm on the surface but tense within—there was no other reason; such a brazen grab from a tiger's mouth was truly exhilarating, and she had not expected Yang Kai to be so bold, daring to scheme against two Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors!

Yet… if one is a man favored by the Lady, one must have courage; without some boldness he would not be worthy of the Lady—thinking this, Biluo found herself oddly expectant.

The battle on the other side continued. Yang Kai and Biluo hid behind that iceberg without revealing themselves. The two Ice Heart Valley women's minds were entirely absorbed by the Heaven and Earth Spirit; they had neither time nor breath to probe their surroundings.

As time went on, the fighting grew ever fiercer. The two Ice Heart Valley women were fighting with their lives to force a way out; by this point they bitterly regretted rashly intruding and provoking the Heaven and Earth Spirit, cursing themselves for acting recklessly—now they not only failed to obtain their goal but faced the danger of falling here.

But regret was of no use; faced with the Heaven and Earth Spirit's attacks formed from surrounding cold qi, they could only defend desperately while seeking a way to escape.

The situation worsened; both women were sweating profusely, their delicate faces drained of color.

Yang Kai watched coldly from nearby, searching for an opening. Suddenly he frowned as if sensing something—an omen rose in his heart.

The sensation… felt as if he had been singled out and watched by someone.

At once Yang Kai reined in his mind and frowned as he scanned the surroundings. His gaze found nothing suspicious; his Divine Sense could not stray far, so he could not use his powerful Divine Sense to probe too widely.

Yet he did not think the earlier sensation had been mistaken—perhaps… there really were others hiding in this place.

Thinking this, Yang Kai bowed his head slightly and a golden light flashed from his left eye as he pushed the World-Ending Demon Eye to its extreme.

With that, Yang Kai finally made a discovery.

Behind another iceberg less than thirty zhang away from him, two figures were pressed together. Whatever mystical treasure they used completely cloaked their presence and aura; even seen through the World-Ending Demon Eye their true faces could not be discerned, only blurred silhouettes.

From their builds they appeared to be a man and a woman, and the man was missing an arm.

Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect, and that beauteous Sect Master?

The images of the two rose immediately in Yang Kai's mind and his expression shifted. Though only a conjecture, it was likely accurate: a man-and-woman pair with the man missing an arm—apart from the two of the Demon Blood Sect there were no other plausible candidates.

If there were another explanation it would be an extraordinary coincidence.

They actually were here—what a narrow road for foes. Yang Kai inwardly cursed his luck. His relations with the Demon Blood Sect were hardly harmonious; before entering the Imperial Garden Jin Shi had even tried to strike him down, only to be halted by Imperial Might and end up injured himself.

The threats from that day were still fresh in his ears; now that they met again, Jin Shi would certainly not let it pass calmly.

The two on the other side must have noticed him—the earlier omen probably came from them. Fortunately, Yang Kai had used the World-Ending Demon Eye silently, so Jin Shi and the Sect Master remained unaware and he retained some initiative.

The mantis stalks the cicada while the oriole waits behind—who is the hunter?

With the situation so entangled, Yang Kai dared not act rashly, for a single misstep could ruin everything.

On the other side sharp cries and shouts continued. Though the two Ice Heart Valley women were not weak and their Secret Treasures were potent, fighting the Heaven and Earth Spirit here was an exercise in futility.

All the Secret Treasures they had summoned were struck by the overwhelming barrage of ice-element attacks, their spirits nearly extinguished. Even their protective Saint Yuan wavered dangerously—on the verge of being shattered at any moment.

In contrast, the Heaven and Earth Spirit in white rabbit form wore an expression of ease, its crimson eyes full of mockery. It bounded about with extreme agility, gathering the surrounding ice-cold qi and transforming it into spear-like implements that it showered upon the two Ice Heart Valley women.

The whistling of tearing air never ceased. The two women's faces darkened; employing some profound secret techniques, they linked their Saint Yuan in a short time to repel the enemy together.

Boom, boom, boom…

The entire Ice Path echoed with tremendous noise as Heaven-and-Earth Energy churned, as if the end of days had arrived, terrifying all who witnessed it.

Agonized screams rang out as the two graceful figures were hurled backward, blood spouting from them as they flew through the air, staining their white garments red—a pitiful sight.

At this point the two Ice Heart Valley women appeared utterly despairing; having exhausted the majority of their Saint Yuan and been wounded by the Heaven and Earth Spirit, they were powerless to resist and could only close their eyes and wait for death.

It was then that two other figures suddenly emerged from behind an iceberg with uncanny swiftness, as if appearing from thin air, instantly becoming two blood-red streaks that sped toward the Heaven and Earth Spirit.

The instant they arrived Yang Kai realized they were indeed Jin Shi and the beauteous Sect Master of the Demon Blood Sect.

The two chose this moment to strike not out of any charitable intent to save others, but because the Heaven and Earth Spirit was most relaxed right now—they aimed squarely at it.

Although an ice-attributed Heaven and Earth Spirit was of little use to them, capturing such an exotic treasure could be exchanged for many other things they desired.

As for Yang Kai and Biluo, Jin Shi and the Sect Master paid them little mind; they planned to deal with the Heaven and Earth Spirit first, and then come to trouble them afterward.

Their timing and angle were impeccable. Midair, Jin Shi puffed his cheek and let out a cicada-like cry that formed a visible, terrifying sonic wave, sweeping forward to envelop the area.

Ripples spread in circles and rapidly expanded, directly wrapping the Heaven and Earth Spirit within.

The Heaven and Earth Spirit, about to strike at the two Ice Heart Valley women, was caught unprepared and immediately struck by the wave.

Ordinary attacks would be useless against such a formless being, but Jin Shi's sonic secret art was clearly extraordinary. The old man cultivated the Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art, an ancient lineage of enormous power; this Golden Cicada Cry chiefly targets the spirit.

Though the Heaven and Earth Spirit possessed intelligence, its development was incomplete and it most feared this sort of assault—Jin Shi's move was precisely the right remedy, and its effect was remarkable.

The white-rabbit Heaven and Earth Spirit showed unmistakable agony; its movements halted as if about to collapse, it clutched its head with its forepaws and writhed on the ground.

At that moment the Demon Blood Sect's beautiful Sect Master struck. With a flick of her slender hand two blood-red threads shot forth.

Demon Blood Threads!

As the Sect Master of the Demon Blood Sect, she had in fact refined two Demon Blood Threads.

The Demon Blood Sect's method of refining Demon Blood Threads differs fundamentally from Yang Kai's. Yang Kai used his own Golden Blood to condense Golden Blood Threads, and so long as his Golden Blood was ample, refining many carried no harm to him.

The Demon Blood Sect's Demon Blood Threads, however, are condensed from one's own qi and blood—the essence of flesh and blood accumulated over years—making them priceless to members of the Demon Blood Sect.

When cultivating Demon Blood Threads a warrior suffers great losses of qi and blood, and afterwards must find means to replenish them, or hidden dangers will remain.

Generally a person can only form one Demon Blood Thread in a lifetime; if one forces a second, the burden on the body would be enormous and one might even die from utter exhaustion of essence.

The consequences could be extremely severe!
