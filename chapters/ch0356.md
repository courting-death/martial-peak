## Chapter 356 — Let's See If You Die This Time

At Taifang Mountain, on a ridge.

Over a hundred martial artists spread out around, carefully and vigilantly lying in ambush.

According to Xiang Chu, scouts from the other side of Taifang Mountain had returned with precise information that a batch of martial artists from Cangyun Evil Land would come today for a final raid.

Thus, he led his people to lay in ambush here, preparing to intercept the enemy's forces.

Initially, the members of Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower were skeptical about this news. After all, it had been a long time since either side had any conflict; how could Cangyun Evil Land possibly attempt a surprise attack at the last moment?

But as time passed, when a group of martial artists did infiltrate, their doubts were dispelled.

There were not many attackers, perhaps only sixty or seventy, with the number of those in the Divine Roaming Realm being scarce. Under Xiang Chu's effective deployment and command, those from Cangyun Evil Land were defeated, losing their armor and weapons, fleeing in panic with heavy casualties.

The battle lasted not long, about half a day.

When the members of Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower returned to regroup, they were alarmed to find that many martial artists were missing from their ranks.

Upon closer inspection, it became clear that the ones missing were all from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard!

Everyone realized that something was off.

"Xiang Chu!" Hu Jiao’er directly approached the Young Master of Xiang Family, her pretty face cold as she questioned, "Where are Xie Rong and Li Fu's people?"

Xiang Chu was momentarily taken aback and suspiciously replied, "Weren't they with you guys to chase after the enemies?"

"No!" Hu Jiao’er’s expression darkened, "I haven’t seen them since the battle began!"

"What?" Xiang Chu's expression also changed, pondering for a moment. Terrified, he looked at Hu Jiao’er and said, "That’s bad, we need to go back quickly!"

Saying this, he hurriedly led a group of people back.

Hu Jiao’er watched his back, her silver teeth clenched, but feeling helpless, she could only speed up with her sister, trying to withdraw as quickly as possible.

The sudden disappearance of the troops from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard made their whereabouts clear.

Hu Jiao’er had worried before that these two factions might cause trouble for Yang Kai, but since this action involved everyone, and with those troops under her watch, she hadn’t been too concerned.

Who would have thought that they would vanish right after the battle started? By the time they realized, it was too late.

Now it seemed that today's mission was probably a premeditated trap!

Anxiously, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er activated the Consonant Spirit Technique, their speed suddenly doubled, the two striking figures shot past Xiang Chu, flying like meteorites.

Xiang Chu’s eyes narrowed slightly as he unexpectedly stared at the sisters from the Hu Family, surprised at their formidable strength.

...

In the camp, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the bed, operating the True Yang Technique, seeming to wait for something silently.

He did not wait long.

Since Hu Jiao’er and her sister left, less than a day and night later, his Divine Sense detected some unusual movements.

He opened his eyes, his gaze shimmering with brilliance, a chilling smile gracing his lips as he murmured softly to himself, “They’re coming?”

Ever since he learned that Hu Jiao’er and the others were going on a mission, Yang Kai anticipated that someone would come to deal with him.

Among all the people here, aside from the two elites from Xiang Family, he feared no one! And the two from Xiang Family were unlikely to act; they had to stay close to Xiang Chu at all times to guard against unforeseen events. So even though Yang Kai understood the current situation, he had no intention of leaving.

Shush shush shush...

Around him, the sounds of fabric swishing resonated, and the newcomers showed no intention of hiding, openly surrounding Yang Kai's location.

Moments later, everything fell silent, with only the faint murderous intent and hostility spreading in the air.

“Since you’ve come, don’t hide!” Yang Kai called out loudly, rising to his feet and striking out with his fists.

Countless fist shadows flew out, the house he was in collapsing with a loud crash.

Dust flew up, smoke enveloped the area.

When the dust settled, figures appeared around him.

Xie Rong from Leiguang and Li Fu from Feihong Courtyard both looked at Yang Kai with a gaze full of hatred. That night, both had suffered greatly at Yang Kai's hands, enduring humiliation. Xie Rong, even at that moment, dared not easily open his mouth, fearing others would see the ugly state of his broken teeth.

The two factions had about thirty or forty people. Besides the two from the Divine Roaming Realm they had seen that night, the rest were all younger disciples.

A triumphant sneer echoed from Xie Rong, "Kid, let’s see if you can die this time!"

Li Fu also sneered repeatedly, "You’ll pay the price; no one has ever treated me like that!"

Though both were injured heavily, after half a month of recovery with the pills provided by their elders and Xiang Chu, they were now almost fully healed. Knowing they could come to trouble Yang Kai without any worries, the two were naturally eager for revenge.

"You’re not enough, too weak!" Yang Kai laughed disdainfully, the contempt in his expression unmistakable.

Xie Rong and Li Fu’s faces flushed simultaneously as they recalled that night when they had been utterly powerless against Yang Kai, their confidence momentarily shattered.

“Young man, you are too arrogant!” a master from Leiguang stepped forward, coldly staring at Yang Kai. “With us two here, do you think there are any good outcomes for you today?”

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, tilting his head to look at him, casually asking, “This was all instigated by Xiang Chu, right? Including what happened that night.”

The two in the Divine Roaming Realm sneered but did not answer.

Yang Kai had already made a decision in his heart, casually nodding, "What benefits did he offer you, making you so eager to offend me?”

The master from Leiguang sneered, “What are you? After today, you’ll be a corpse; what does it matter to offend you?”

Cold light flashed in Yang Kai's eyes as he grinned sinisterly, “The price for offending me, you might not be able to afford!”

As soon as his voice fell, a purple aura suddenly surged out from his mind.

Soul technique!

“Scatter!” the master from Feihong Courtyard shouted angrily. He also released his Divine Sense, attempting to intercept Yang Kai's attack.

Having suffered slight losses that night, he naturally knew the peculiarities of this technique, so he used all his strength as soon as he acted.

What he never expected was that this time, Yang Kai's soul technique appeared slightly different; the purple light burst out suddenly after it spread away. A visible ripple swept across, and all the young disciples struck by this ripple instantly felt pain, clutching their heads, wailing in agony.

The two in the Divine Roaming Realm’s eyes bulged in disbelief, not seeing Yang Kai's soul technique evolve in such a way. They were caught off guard and couldn’t intercept it at all.

In that moment of surprise, purple light surged out in quick succession.

It was as if stones were thrown into a still lake, ripples erupted one after another.

In an instant, four or five ripples expanded.

All the young disciples swept by these ripples suddenly fell silent, their eyes filled with bloodshot veins, blood pouring from their ears and nostrils, softly collapsing to the ground.

In the blink of an eye, seven or eight people died simultaneously!

These individuals were weak and lacked magical artifacts to defend against soul techniques. How could they withstand such devastation?

“Junior seeking death!” The two experts from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard were furious, simultaneously leaping out, attacking Yang Kai from both sides.

Amidst his laughter, Yang Kai performed another soul technique while also launching an attack on the two. His palms pushed out, the White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal unleashed in tandem, while his figure transformed as he soared into the midst of the Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard disciples, executing the Triple Flame Yang Explosion in rapid succession.

Like a tiger entering a flock of sheep, the young disciples could not handle Yang Kai’s ferocious assault at all. The weakest were killed in one strike, their chests caved in, while the stronger ones could not contend with Yang Kai’s might, suffering severe wounds and collapsing under the impact.

Only Xie Rong and Li Fu managed to join forces desperately to block Yang Kai, but even they were blasted away over ten zhang, crashing to the ground, unable to get up for a while.

The two in the Divine Roaming Realm had just shredded the Beast Souls of the White Tiger and Divine Ox when they caught sight of Yang Kai rampaging through the disciple group, immediately seeing another five or six killed. They were furious, shouting, "You dare, kid!"

“Whether I dare or not, I’ve already done it!” Yang Kai grinned wickedly, casually snapping the neck of a disciple from Leiguang and tossing the corpse away, which rolled several circles before finally coming to a stop, the death agonizing.

The hearts of the two in the Divine Roaming Realm nearly bled. They had come today to find trouble with Yang Kai, initially thinking they could easily capture him, but they never expected that in just a short moment of fighting, they had already lost over ten people while the opponent remained unscathed.

In a hurry, they chased after, finally stopping Yang Kai's slaughtering pace.

“Get away!” the expert from Feihong Courtyard yelled angrily.

At his shout, the remaining disciples all paled, desperately retreating dozens of zhang, their eyes trembling as they gazed at the center of the battlefield.

With two experts from the Divine Roaming Realm present, they no longer worried about the young disciples’ casualties. They began to unleash their full might, combining their attacks viciously, their True Essence spreading like mist, enveloping Yang Kai within, striking without mercy.

The two were quite aggrieved; in confrontations between Divine Roaming Realm and True Essence Realm, their greatest advantage lay in the use of soul techniques. Yet before Yang Kai, they not only dared not use them but also had to guard against his soul attacks, illuminating their frustration.

The battle among the three was extremely intense. While Yang Kai was clearly at an absolute disadvantage, being suppressed by the two experts, the fact that a True Essence Realm cultivator could withstand the attacks of two Divine Roaming Realm masters was impressive enough.

Xie Rong and Li Fu's pale faces reflected their realization that being captured that night by Yang Kai wasn't due to negligence but rather that he indeed possessed this capability.

Even if they took care to guard against him now, they would still not escape Yang Kai's assaults.

“What kind of freak is this? How can he be so powerful?” Xie Rong’s mouth felt bitter, disbelief etched across his expression.

Li Fu's face was as white as paper, completely lost for words, her beautiful eyes trembling violently, regretting having provoked such an individual.

His power and terror had surpassed all Li Fu’s expectations, even her original desire for revenge was now significantly diminished.

Now Li Fu could only hope that their two elders could severely injure or even kill Yang Kai on the spot; otherwise, they would never find peace again.
