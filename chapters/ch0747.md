## Chapter 747 — Pill Cloud

After walking a short distance, several figures suddenly darted out from the line and hurried into the collapsed houses on either side; at the same time, many noticed that something inside those ruined rooms seemed to be emitting waves of energy.

Hai Wangu waved his hand, signaling everyone to halt and wait in silence.

Those who had dashed ahead were warriors of the Hai Family — after all, this was their territory, and the outsiders, though they sensed the anomaly, did not act before them.

If there was loot, the Hai Family could have a taste; if danger awaited, it was only right that the Hai Family probe it first — that was how everyone reasoned.

A moment later the Hai Family men returned swiftly from both sides; the two who came back from the left bore long faces and slowly shook their heads at Hai Wangu, clearly having found nothing.

By contrast, those returning from the right wore expressions of extreme excitement, one of them presenting to Hai Wangu an object of plainly ancient workmanship.

All eyes latched onto that object like leeches.

Hai Wangu took it, carefully brushing away the dust, then released his Divine Sense to probe it — his brow rose and he nodded: “Hm, it’s a Secret Treasure, but it’s aged and has lost much of its spiritual essence; now it’s roughly a Mystery-Grade, Lower-Level item. A pity — if intact, this might have been at least an Upper-Level Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure!”

Hearing him, everyone involuntarily showed expressions of regret.

He wasn’t lying; with all eyes on that treasure and his Divine Sense inspecting it, deception was impossible.

Still, finding a Secret Treasure so soon after setting out was a great auspice, and the group brimmed with renewed expectation.

“Let this old man take it for now. Once we return, I’ll have a refiner restore it; perhaps some of its spirit can be recovered and its grade raised.” Hai Wangu declared, placing the treasure into his Spatial Pouch.

He had said beforehand that anything found would be kept by him to be shared after their return — and since it had been Hai Family men who found it, no one objected.

Buoyed by the gain, everyone searched with even greater concentration.

To broaden the search, Hai Wangu split the party into three teams, each led by a Transcendent Realm expert from the Hai Family, and they fanned out in three directions.

Yang Kai still followed behind Hai Wangu; once the groups divided, his side dwindled to fewer than twenty people. Aside from Hai Wangu, only Yang Kai was Transcendent Realm — the rest were Divine Roaming Realm cultivators.

In the collapsed houses along the road, the party occasionally found items that made their eyes brighten, most of them Secret Treasures, and occasionally martial technique manuals; however, time had ruined many of those tomes, which crumbled to dust the moment they were handled, causing lament.

There were also some pills, but likewise their potency had long since dissipated, leaving only worthless residue.

Half a day later the group had gathered only a few damaged Secret Treasures whose spiritual cores were greatly depleted. They were somewhat dissatisfied; the haul fell far short of expectations.

Yang Kai kept to the rear, neither seeking the spotlight nor deliberately hiding himself, merely comporting as a Seventh Stage Divine Roaming cultivator should, drawing no attention or suspicion.

Among the ten-odd treasures found, he had contributed a share, though he felt no real interest in them.

What puzzled him was that this ancient ruin should belong to a long-departed great sect; such a sect would surely have left ample sealing formations. Judging from the outer barrier that had blocked the sea, those protections should remain effective, yet they had encountered no real danger so far.

That only made him more alert.

While walking, a lanky man suddenly drew near; Yang Kai frowned and glanced casually at him, only to find the man grinning at him in a silent, eerie way.

“Something you need?” Yang Kai asked.

“Kid, you’re sharp!” the man said, glancing at Hai Wangu leading the way to make sure he wasn’t looking, then lowering his voice.

Yang Kai found it oddly amusing — the man was another outsider following Hai Wangu, a Divine Roaming Realm cultivator at the peak, not old, maybe in his thirties, with narrow, snake-like eyes that constantly betrayed a calculating malice.

He'd approached Yang Kai without reason, which made Yang Kai wonder what scheme he was hatching.

“I can tell,” the man said with a slight nod. “You’re taciturn, but your eyes shine — that’s craftiness. Hiding your true power to pull off a big score?”

“No, you’re overthinking it,” Yang Kai said, shaking his head slowly.

“Don’t deny it — everyone thinks that way,” the lanky man chuckled. “That old fellow puts all the finds into his Spatial Pouch; who knows what he plans. Up there he might not share anything, or only give us crumbs. This is the territory of the Seven Great Families alliance — ultimately they decide!”

“If they eat the meat, I’ll have a sip of the soup,” Yang Kai chuckled. “I don’t ask for much.”

“You don’t look like someone easy to satisfy!” the man scoffed, his voice dropping further. “So? Interested in teaming up with me?”

“Team up for what?”

The lanky man wore an ‘are you dense?’ look: “It seems there’s no danger here. We should break off from the group and search on our own; anything we find is ours — why trail them?”

“Hmm? Not a bad idea!” Yang Kai’s eyes brightened, showing genuine interest.

“You like it too?” The man, seeing Yang Kai’s reaction, pressed his advantage. “The two of us act together; if we find something valuable we split it evenly — no one screws the other. I’m fair!”

“Good idea, but I’ll stay with them. More people means more safety.” Yang Kai feigned hesitation and shook his head.

The lanky man grew anxious and tried to persuade him.

Yang Kai refused to budge; the man, exasperated, sneered, “You fool, following them will get you hurt sooner or later!”

Yang Kai ignored him.

This fellow was clearly up to no good. His eagerness to recruit Yang Kai showed he wanted an accomplice to bolster his courage — if real danger appeared, two together would find it a bit easier to cope.

Once a treasure was found, with him at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, dealing with a young man like Yang Kai would be effortless, wouldn’t it?

At least, that’s how he saw it.

Yang Kai snorted inwardly: he wasn’t anyone’s fool.

“The next few rooms ahead — send some people to check them!” Hai Wangu suddenly stopped and pointed to several houses.

The group nodded and a number moved off in threes and fives toward those rooms.

Yang Kai followed the crowd to the right.

Five people entered together; in the outer chamber three warriors were rummaging through boxes. Yang Kai judged there’d likely be no finds here and headed deeper in, but before he could step forward the lanky man who had spoken to him shot ahead and slipped inside first.

Yang Kai shook his head at the man’s haste and entered as well.

Most things inside had decayed to dust, but in a corner of the annex room several jade flasks lay scattered on the floor.

At that moment the lanky man helplessly grabbed a jade flask and casually opened it to take a look.

Such flasks were common finds — used to hold pills, though the pills inside had long since lost their potency and were worthless.

But when the lanky man glanced inside now his expression shifted and a flash of fanatic light stirred in his eyes.

“Something good?” Yang Kai said, his expression changing.

The lanky man, suddenly remembering Yang Kai, hurriedly nodded: “Look!”

Saying so, he handed the jade flask over.

Yang Kai took it, peered inside, and when he saw a pill that looked different from the rest his face changed.

The pill differed greatly from ordinary pills: its rounded body was wrapped in a drifting, cloudlike haze — a transparent protective membrane composed purely of Spiritual Qi that enveloped the entire pill.

No one knew how many years had passed, but the pill’s potency had not faded; instead it had grown stronger.

Its fragrance filled the air and cleared the mind.

With a single sniff, Yang Kai confirmed it was a Saint-Grade pill.

The pill’s grade was impressive, but what shocked him more was the cloud of Spiritual Qi that shrouded it.

“A Pill Cloud?” Yang Kai breathed.

Now an accomplished alchemist himself, Yang Kai had often produced pills with vein-like patterns — pill patterns akin to meridians — during refining.

Once a pill developed pill patterns, its value jumped severalfold, and so long as storage conditions were appropriate, its potency would not decay over time.

Every excellent alchemist pursued the emergence of pill patterns and sought ways to make their pills bear them, but no reliable method existed to guarantee pill patterns — it largely depended on luck.

Luck played a significant role.

Beyond pill patterns, legend spoke of the rarer Pill Cloud.

Although Yang Kai often produced pill patterns, he had never seen a Pill Cloud.

Now, at last, he had seen with his own eyes what a Pill Cloud was.

It was said that a Pill Cloud not only multiplied a pill’s potency many times over and preserved it indefinitely, but could also constantly gather the world’s Spiritual Qi to nourish the pill.

In short, a pill with a Pill Cloud would grow more potent the longer it was stored and its value would rise accordingly.
