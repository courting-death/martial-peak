## Chapter 263 — Seizing the Enemy's Sword Technique

Zi Mo stood to the side, staring in astonishment, unable to suppress a sneer.

These two clearly wished to eliminate each other as soon as possible, to grind each other’s bones to dust and shatter their corpses. Just moments ago, they had fought fiercely, without mercy, yet at this critical juncture, they were exchanging details and reminding each other.

Men… truly strange creatures.

As a woman, and a cunning one at that, Zi Mo could hardly comprehend that sometimes men are even prouder than women. At certain moments, even in death, they would not abandon their pride!

Wu Chengyi's pride made him confident that this strike could finish Yang Kai, so he was not worried about any repercussions from revealing his intentions.

Yang Kai's pride made him unwilling to take advantage of Wu Chengyi, hence his response to the reminder.

This was a battle of men!

Women… do not understand.

Amidst the over two thousand sword energies, Wu Chengyi suddenly moved.

At that moment, his expression became peculiar. It was grave yet filled with a sense of reverence, as if what he was about to unleash was not merely a sword technique, but the blossoming of life itself.

The long sword spun, a streak of light shimmering at its tip.

The overwhelming sword energies rang out simultaneously, a constant buzzing sound filling the air, as the fierce sword intent surged towards the heavens.

More than half of the over two thousand sword energies suddenly vanished, leaving just over a thousand, and then, half of those disappeared again, leaving five hundred…

Three hundred sword energies… two hundred… one hundred… ninety…

A soft sigh escaped Wu Chengyi's lips, filled with a sense of regret and helplessness.

After the sigh, Wu Chengyi's complexion abruptly flushed red, his spirit soaring.

With a shake of the long sword, over ninety sword energies surged towards Yang Kai like a torrential storm!

Ten Thousand Swords Return to One!

The unpassed secret of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect, which could only be learned by those who made significant contributions to the sect. Among the younger generation of Wu Chengyi's time, he was the only one who had learned it, showcasing the high hopes his elders had for him.

If this sword technique were cultivated to perfection, the ten thousand swords would return to one, capable of tearing apart the heavens and earth. A single strike could change the colors of mountains and rivers. However, Wu Chengyi's current strength was insufficient; even after exhausting all his True Yuan, he could only condense over two thousand sword energies, ultimately converging them into just ninety sword lights.

Even so, such a move was immensely powerful.

Zi Mo's beautiful eyes trembled. Even from nearly two hundred zhang away, she could clearly feel the bone-chilling sword intent approaching. The air around her seemed to turn into blades, slicing at her skin, sending waves of pain throughout her body akin to being bitten by countless mosquitoes.

This sword… had exceeded her capacity to endure and comprehend.

Had Wu Chengyi used this sword against her earlier, she would have been reduced to ashes.

In panic, she looked towards Yang Kai, unsure if he had the strength to withstand it.

Over there, Yang Kai's figure was completely enveloped in black aura, rendering his true form indistinguishable. In the darkness, only two scarlet eyes emitted a chilling glow, filled with madness and calmness.

A bizarre combination of contradictions.

Facing the approaching ninety sword energies, Yang Kai did not evade. He gripped the Shura Sword tightly, channeling all his strength forward, as the demonic energy that had been devoured by the Shura Sword erupted violently.

A wave of unsettling fluctuations exploded, centered around Yang Kai's position. The ground seemed to be upheaved, a storm of dust and stones swirling around.

Yet, where the Shura Sword pointed, there were no sword energies, no sword lights, nothing at all.

The strangeness of this sword move was beyond Zi Mo's imagination.

After unleashing this sword strike, Yang Kai straightened up, a smile gracing his lips as he rested the crimson long sword on his shoulder.

That smile was filled with confidence.

Wu Chengyi's pupils constricted rapidly. Although he saw no attack, a strong sense of unease surged from his heart. It felt like a summons from death.

In the blink of an eye, Wu Chengyi's ninety sword energies flew towards Yang Kai. But in mid-air, a dark pit, roughly the size of a bowl, suddenly appeared.

This scene looked extremely bizarre, as if someone had accidentally spilled a drop of ink onto a painting.

As soon as the dark pit appeared, it rapidly expanded outward, as if it possessed the power to devour everything. Where the black light passed, Zi Mo's vision darkened, and she could see nothing.

In the darkness, sounds of thuds echoed, as if someone had been struck by the sword energies.

Zi Mo's heart trembled, for she recognized that the sounds were coming from where Yang Kai stood. Before she could scream, Wu Chengyi also let out a muffled groan.

The world fell silent once more.

After a moment, Zi Mo noticed light returning, and everything gradually became clear.

Looking around, the world was bright again, the sunset had fallen, and the evening glow painted the earth a bloody hue.

A violent heartbeat echoed in her chest as Zi Mo nervously looked towards Yang Kai, only to see him still standing in place, his upper garments completely shredded, revealing a sturdy and powerful figure.

Though not overly muscular, it was clear that his body was filled with explosive strength, now marked with several patches of crimson, both front and back, blood gushing from those wounds.

These were injuries inflicted by the sword energies.

Defeated? Zi Mo couldn't help but cover her mouth, disbelief filling her beautiful eyes. How could such a powerful and defiant man have been defeated?

Looking at Wu Chengyi, he too stood in his original position, seemingly unmoved, his body straight as a spear, his eyes filled with arrogance and defiance.

His long sword was now planted before him, the breeze stirring his robes.

A drop of crimson spread across his chest, gradually expanding.

His lips twitched, struggling to say something, but no words came out, his expression gradually stiffening.

The defiance and arrogance in his eyes faded, replaced by a vacant, lifeless gaze.

Life had completely vanished!

Zi Mo gasped, her expression incredibly complex.

Was this truly a mutual destruction outcome?

“Cough, cough…” Suddenly, a light cough came from Yang Kai's direction. Zi Mo jolted, turning to look, only to see Yang Kai propped up by the Shura Sword, his figure swaying unsteadily, on the verge of collapse.

“Beauty…” Yang Kai painfully turned his head to look at her, a bitter smile on his lips, “Could you lend me a hand?”

This brat really hadn’t died! Zi Mo bit her lip, her gaze flickering, hesitating for a moment. She gracefully approached him.

Covering a distance of over a hundred zhang took Zi Mo more than twenty breaths.

With a complex expression, she looked at Yang Kai, her emotions in turmoil.

If she were to kill him here now…

Then she would no longer have to worry about the imprint in her mind.

But thinking back to that day when this man stood up for her, killing Bi Xiuming and his two disciples, and even saving her life from the encirclement of demonic beasts, Zi Mo found it hard to take action. Moreover, if it weren't for him, she would surely have fallen into Wu Chengyi's clutches.

Counting it all, he had saved her twice.

Sigh, what a headache…

“Pick up the things on the ground for me!” Yang Kai panted heavily.

Zi Mo was pulled from her thoughts. Looking down, she saw a small cloth bag on the ground, bending to pick it up. She handed it to Yang Kai, curious, “What is this?”

“Nothing, just a small secret treasure.” Yang Kai chuckled, stuffing the Spatial Pouch into his pants pocket, then without hesitation, he pulled Zi Mo closer, draping an arm over her shoulder, his weight pressing heavily against her.

“Let’s go to Wu Chengyi!” Yang Kai gestured.

Zi Mo shot him a glare but obediently supported him towards Wu Chengyi.

Upon reaching Wu Chengyi, Yang Kai reached into his bosom and began to search. Finally, he found a small bottle, which contained half a vial of liquid.

“Ha ha!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, his guess had indeed been correct; Wu Chengyi also had Liuyan Liquid, and even more than the amount from Qi Jianxing.

“What is this?” Zi Mo looked on eagerly, knowing it must be something good, yet she couldn't bring herself to ask for it.

“I'll tell you later!” Yang Kai grinned. “Find a place, I need to heal!”

…

In the wilderness, within a pit on a dirt slope, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the ground, bare-chested.

His battle with Wu Chengyi had not left him heavily injured; the wounds on his body were not from Wu Chengyi's sword energies.

But from the sword intent!

The sword intent of Ten Thousand Swords Return to One unleashed by Wu Chengyi had penetrated into Yang Kai's body!

At this moment, he held the Shura Sword in both hands, comprehending this sword intent.

Since obtaining this town-protecting treasure from the Shura Sect, Yang Kai had used it once during his battle with Bai Yunfeng in the Lingxiao Pavilion.

Back then, he had just refined the Shura Sword into his body and had no time to familiarize himself with it, so his understanding of it remained at the level of a heavenly-grade treasure.

More than a year had passed, and the Shura Sword had been nurtured within his Dantian by Yuan Qi, merging with him.

Now, it had finally become one with him.

This time of use allowed Yang Kai to discover that the Shura Sword was not merely a heavenly-grade weapon for killing; it also had a very special function.

That was to seize the enemy's sword techniques for his own use!

It was specifically effective for sword techniques!

In the clash with Wu Chengyi's final strike, the Shura Sword had utilized a large amount of the evil energy from Yang Kai's Golden Body, forming a black hole that devoured the lethality of Wu Chengyi's sword techniques, leaving only the sword intent to strike.

Thus, Yang Kai did not dodge but bore it with his physical body.

Yet even the sword intent had pierced through Yang Kai's body, making him appear severely injured.

Sword intent is the essence of a sword technique, much like a person's Divine Sense. A sword move without sword intent is merely a hollow form, forever unable to unleash much power.

At this moment, Yang Kai was comprehending the sword intent of this move, peering into the mysteries of Ten Thousand Swords Return to One.

Once successful, he would have a sword technique to wield. Moreover, this sword technique would not be of low grade.

The unpassed secret of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect was a profound-level sword technique.

The Shura Sword's ability was quite peculiar; no wonder it became the sect-protecting treasure of the Shura Sect. However, seizing another's sword technique was also a dangerous endeavor; if one was not careful, they might end up severely wounded instead.

Yang Kai remained calm and unhurried, slowly discerning, as images of Wu Chengyi's movements and True Yuan fluctuations during the execution of Ten Thousand Swords Return to One replayed in his mind. The Shura Sword also resonated with a series of marvelous ripples.

Zi Mo stood at the cave entrance, feeling bored, her expression complex as she watched Yang Kai with closed eyes.

While playing with her hair, she bit her lip, contemplating whether to ambush Yang Kai and kill this detestable brat. Yet after much thought, she found herself unable to make a decision, her heart in turmoil.
