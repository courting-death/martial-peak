## Chapter 297 â€” Death Under the Peony

Silver light flashed, and the three experts of the Divine Roaming Realm, who had just forced Yang Kai into a corner, fell to the ground like wheat, utterly powerless to resist, killed in confusion.

The silver light did not diminish, aiming to eradicate Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman as well.

At the critical moment of life and death, a faint glow emanated from the exquisite earrings adorning Qiu Yimeng's delicate earlobes, rushing into her mind and instantly awakening her.

In the blink of an eye, Qiu Yimeng hurriedly took out her ancient shield and placed it in front of her.

With a clang, Qiu Yimeng spat out blood and was sent flying, the silver light finally halted.

The woman frowned, her delicate body trembling, her crimson lips nearly dripping blood. It seemed that she had just used a bit of True Yuan, making her current state even harder to endure.

Not wanting to continue fighting, she hurriedly carried the bound Yang Kai and leaped away, seemingly impatient.

Luo Xiaoman's complexion was flushed, her beautiful eyes hazy, soft moans continuously escaping her throat. Her long legs were tightly pressed together, an overwhelming pleasure coursing through her like electricity, leaving her lower body numb, her delicate form trembling involuntarily. Soon, a pool of hot, lustrous liquid spilled forth from her lower abdomen, soaking her panties.

A high-pitched, suppressed moan escaped her lips as Luo Xiaoman's body went limp, collapsing to the ground, her cheeks flushed, gasping for air, her soft bosom rising and falling as she reveled in the aftershocks of ecstasy.

"Xiaoman... cough cough..." Qiu Yimeng weakly called out from the side.

"En..." Luo Xiaoman suddenly snapped back to reality, realizing her own disarray and the dampness below. She was immediately shocked, her face paling.

She had no idea what had just happened; the woman in red had merely spoken a single sentence, and she had fallen into a dreamy, enchanting illusion. In that illusion, she had abandoned her dignity and shyness, transforming into a dissatisfied, resentful woman, endlessly seeking pleasure.

And the object of her desire was none other than Yang Kai, whom they had chased here!

Recalling the scenes from just moments ago, Luo Xiaoman felt a surge of shame and anger. Her beautiful eyes trembled, quickly flashing with boundless hatred and humiliation!

"Xiaoman... come help me!" Qiu Yimeng's True Yuan surged, her blood reversing. Unable to move, she saw Luo Xiaoman still standing there foolishly and couldn't help but call out again.

"Oh..." Luo Xiaoman finally stumbled to her feet. As the wind blew, she felt a chill below, a faint icy sensation bringing a tingle of pleasure, causing her body to shiver slightly.

"What's wrong with you?" Qiu Yimeng looked at her in confusion, sensing something was off.

"Nothing... nothing!" Luo Xiaoman hurriedly replied, her face flushed as she rushed to Qiu Yimeng's side. Following her instructions, she took out a bottle of Pill from her arms and poured one into her mouth.

Staring blankly at the corpses of the three Divine Roaming Realm experts, Luo Xiaoman felt a wave of fear wash over her.

After a long while, Qiu Yimeng finally exhaled a long breath.

"Sister Qiu, who was that woman?" Luo Xiaoman asked, sitting on the ground with her knees hugged to her chest, looking fragile and shaken.

Qiu Yimeng slowly shook her head. "I don't know, but no matter who she is, she is a seductress. We must be careful if we encounter her again."

"Oh..." Luo Xiaoman replied, feeling somewhat guilty.

A simple sentence had turned an innocent girl into a resentful woman. Clearly, that woman had cultivated some extraordinary seductive technique; what kind of good could come from a woman who practiced such arts?

Before long, a group of over a dozen True Yuan Realm experts finally arrived from the surroundings, drawn here by the sounds of battle.

Bai Yunfeng was among them. This kid had good luck; not only had he avoided falling into the collapsing void passage, but he also hadn't encountered the earlier battle, fortunate enough to return with his life.

Once they regrouped and exchanged information, Qiu Yimeng's heart sank.

There were less than ten people left on their side, and all three Divine Roaming Realm experts had been killed!

"First, let's see where we are, then we can plan our next steps!" Qiu Yimeng calmly issued orders.

...

In the void, a red figure swept by.

It was the enchanting woman from before, her strength indeed formidable, flying at a speed like the wind. Yang Kai, bound by a pink ribbon, was unable to exert any strength, passively being held by her.

Just as he escaped from the tiger's den, he fell into the wolf's lair, Yang Kai thought.

This woman had killed those few people without batting an eye, attacking without asking for reasons. Clearly, she was not someone easy to deal with, but why had she taken him captive?

Yang Kai was puzzled.

Secretly urging his True Yuan, he found he could not muster any power; only his Divine Sense could be used. However, in front of such experts, how could he dare to release his Divine Sense easily?

"Don't waste your energy. You've been hit by my Soul Blowing Incense; you'll only feel weak and have your True Yuan sealed. Unless your strength is higher than mine!" The soft voice of the woman came from above, causing Yang Kai's heart to race uncontrollably.

"Soul Blowing Incense?" Yang Kai grinned, "Good name!"

Why did that name sound like an aphrodisiac? Yang Kai cursed inwardly, realizing she was indeed a lewd seductress. Moreover, her face had just shown a hint of springtime allure; now that he had fallen into her hands, he wondered if he would be drained of all his True Yuan and die from loss of yang!

Yang Kai instinctively felt that this woman must have cultivated some evil technique for gathering yang to replenish yin.

If he really died like this, it would be too tragic!

"You don't know about Soul Blowing Incense?" The woman seemed slightly surprised.

"Should I know?" Yang Kai retorted with a question, then took a deep breath, suppressing the turbulent blood in his chest. "Forget it, just don't talk to me for now. I'm afraid I won't be able to control myself and will take you."

The woman had been enduring with great difficulty. Hearing Yang Kai's bold and reckless words, she couldn't help but chuckle, her beautiful eyes glancing down slightly. She wondered if this kid really didn't know the name of Soul Blowing Incense; was he not a disciple of the Holy Land?

As she glanced over, she happened to see Yang Kai looking up at her.

The woman's charming smile, with a rosy blush, was incredibly enticing.

Yang Kai's gaze involuntarily shifted, landing on the enchanting view beneath her skirt.

His heart raced even more!

The woman's panties were actually a pair of hollow lace black underwear, revealing glimpses of her lush lower body through the lace, exquisite and boundless. Her long, beautiful legs were like jade, pure and flawless, exuding a porcelain-like alluring sheen.

These legs seemed not of this world, embodying the essence of heaven and earth, captivating Yang Kai's primal instincts. His eyes instantly became dazed and hollow, panting heavily.

Unknowingly, Yang Kai found strength he didn't know he had, and he clumsily reached out a hand, directly touching the woman's calf, rubbing and playing with it.

The woman felt as if struck by lightning. Having endured so much, she was caught off guard by Yang Kai's intimate touch. Her face instantly changed color, the blush on her cheeks becoming even more enchanting, and a bone-deep moan escaped her throat. Her delicate body trembled like a quail in winter.

"You little brat!" The woman was furious, gritting her teeth and scolding him. Though she knew Yang Kai's offense was not entirely intentional and was partly her fault, she still found it hard to endure such caresses.

The rough hand gliding over her body seemed to generate currents of electricity, sending waves of numbness through her. Even as a Divine Roaming Realm expert, she could not maintain steady flight.

Carrying Yang Kai through the air, she swayed as if drunk.

"Let go!" The woman lightly bit her pearly teeth, raising a delicate foot to kick Yang Kai's shoulder, then pulling the ribbon to bring him closer.

Yang Kai's dazed and heated gaze suddenly burst with madness and cunning. He grinned at her, using all his strength to wrap his arms around her slender waist.

"You..." The woman turned pale, seemingly not expecting Yang Kai to remain so rational and clear-headed.

Yang Kai had completely lost his restraint. His hands tightly gripped the woman's soft waist, the sensation was so delightful that it felt as if she had no bones, yielding perfectly under his touch. With just a little force, it seemed he could snap her in two.

His ten fingers danced, teasing and caressing as much as possible, while his mouth unabashedly bit down on her left breast through her red clothing.

This bite was devoid of any True Yuan; Yang Kai couldn't muster much strength, yet it was the most lethal attack.

The scorching male aura penetrated her clothing, scorching her delicate body, leaving her utterly soft and trembling. The bite seemed to transform into sucking, and the woman's True Yuan became sluggish, causing both of them to tilt dangerously toward the ground.

"Quick, let go of me!" The woman hissed through clenched teeth, struggling against the rising emotions and desires within her. Her crimson lips were nearly bitten through, and she held Yang Kai's head, trying to push him away. Yet, the tingling sensation overwhelmed her, leaving her unable to exert much strength, and this position only fueled further fantasies.

"I won't let go!" Yang Kai mumbled, biting down on a small, crimson bead, continuously blowing hot air into it, his tongue flicking like a snake as he answered ambiguously.

This seductress was not in her right state; it seemed she had been hit by the most domineering aphrodisiac in the world. Even the slightest touch could leave her unable to control herself. Her strength was too high to resist, and if he wanted to survive in her grasp, Yang Kai had no choice but to resort to such filthy tactics.

"Do you want to die? If you don't let go, we'll both die a terrible death!" The woman trembled slightly, moaning as they drew closer to the ground. Falling from a height of a hundred zhang, even if the woman was strong, she would still end up as a pile of flesh.

"Hehe, dying under the peony, even as a ghost, one remains romantic!" Yang Kai joked recklessly, showing no concern for life or death.

The woman's expression finally changed, cursing the shameless brat. Taking a deep breath, she endured the discomfort in her body and the impulse in her heart, secretly gathering her True Yuan to slow their descent.

But this surge of True Yuan was quickly shattered by the sensations coursing through her body.

With a loud thud, Yang Kai and the woman crashed to the ground, entangled in each other's arms, rolling several times before finally coming to a stop.
