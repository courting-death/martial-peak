## Chapter 1663 — Volcanic Crater

“It's not Lord Luo Hai.” Wei Qing's face grew heavy as he shook his head. “Lord Luo Hai… has fallen as well.”

“What?”

A collective gasp swept the hall; everyone was stunned. All the elders of the Fire Radiance Sect stared at Wei Qing in shock, their expressions of disbelief even more exaggerated than when they learned of the Grand Elder's death.

“The report isn't wrong. I received word from Cuiwei Star two months ago— the Star Lord's statue shattered, and Lord Luo Hai's sealed aura vanished. He truly has perished, and judging by the timing, it must have happened on those days when he went toward Ice Heart Valley.”

“The Grand Elder has fallen, and Lord Luo Hai with him; who in Ice Heart Valley could possibly pull off such a feat?”

“Indeed, on that very day several months ago there were earth-shattering energy fluctuations coming from the direction of Ice Heart Valley—could that be when it happened?”

“It can't be the Valley's founder, can it? I've heard rumors before that their founding ancestor might not be dead.”

“How is that possible? Ice Heart Valley has been established for nearly thirty thousand years; if their founding ancestor were truly alive, why never show themselves until now?”

“What use is debating this now? Ice Heart Valley has launched a major invasion. Right now we need to quickly discuss how to deal with them.”

“How to deal with them? Our Fire Radiance Sect's Grand Elder is already dead. Luo Li will certainly strike personally. We of the Fire Radiance Sect… are powerless to resist!”

“Don’t you go boosting others’ morale while dampening our own! So what if it’s Luo Li? This old man will fight her to the death — even if I die, I’ll make sure to tear off a piece of her flesh!”

……

After the news that Chi Huo had died, the elders no longer wore their previous optimism or ease; each one wore a grave expression as they voiced their opinions and plans.

Wei Qing sat upright in the head seat, silent, like an outsider.

After a long while he raised his hand; the clamorous hall fell instantly quiet and all eyes turned to him.

“Enough, stop arguing!” Wei Qing said calmly. “Ice Heart Valley has launched a large-scale invasion. Though this may be a great calamity for our Fire Radiance Sect, if we act correctly, it may yet be possible to measure ourselves against them. Luo Li is indeed a Void King Realm expert; none among us can match her. But do not forget— they attack, we defend. We can make use of our formation and sealing arrays to drain their strength. Moreover… it's rumored Luo Li misstepped in her cultivation before and carries a hidden flaw; she may not be able to display her full power.”

“Right, the Sect Master speaks true—defend in place to repel them, we hold the advantage!”

“Heh heh… have you all forgotten we still have that thing! If we unleash it, even Luo Li will drink a bitter cup!” someone sneered; his smile was mad and feral.

The others quickly realized what he meant and their faces changed.

Even Wei Qing's expression grew extremely grave. After a moment's thought he said, “That thing must not be released unless absolutely necessary! Spread my orders: all disciples prepare to meet the enemy. Today we fight. If there is an enemy, there will be no mercy from us!”

“If there is an enemy, there will be no mercy from us!” the elders roared in unison.

……

Five warships slowly sailed into the depths of the Fire Radiance Mountain Range, closing in on the Fire Radiance Sect's main headquarters.

Along the way they encountered formations and sealing arrays that tried to hinder them, but they did not slow Ice Heart Valley's advance; the warships' crystal cannons casually fired and tore those formations and arrays to pieces.

“Bing Long, go ahead and tell the Fire Radiance Sect that I have come to execute only the high ranks; ordinary disciples who want to live should flee at once. When my Ice Heart Valley warships depart, those who do not flee will be declared enemies of Ice Heart Valley and will be killed without mercy.” Luo Li suddenly said.

“Yes!” Bing Long answered and flew out alone.

Soon Bing Long's Divine Sense rippled out, broadcasting the message that only the high ranks would be punished and advising ordinary disciples to flee.

The senior ranks of the Fire Radiance Sect felt that Divine Sense and cursed Bing Long openly, calling her despicable and shameless.

The Fire Radiance Sect numbers tens of thousands; although their cohesion was formidable, in a life-or-death crisis not everyone could march or die with the sect. With Bing Long deliberately spreading the news that Chi Huo had perished, some Fire Radiance disciples' courage broke.

Some began to flee the Fire Radiance Mountain Range.

Those attempting to escape were slain by the sect's senior ranks upon discovery as a warning to others.

Such bloody and brutal measures temporarily cowed most low-level disciples, but as time passed more and more of them grew fearful, and more began to flee.

Beams of light rose from various places within the Fire Radiance Sect and shot out in all directions.

Luo Li's vast Divine Sense covered the entire Fire Radiance Mountain Range.

Martial artists below the Origin Returning Realm were allowed to flee; if any Origin Returning Realm martial artist attempted to run, Luo Li would personally strike them down.

Any Fire Radiance Sect warrior of the Origin Returning Realm carried the blood of countless Ice Heart Valley disciples; Luo Li would not permit them to go.

Those weaker than the Origin Returning Realm soon noticed this and were glad, no longer heeding the sect's exhortations; more began to escape.

In an instant the Fire Radiance Sect's cohesion dissolved; even the elders and deacons' bloody suppression could not salvage the situation.

“Senior Luo Li, I'm going over there first.” Yang Kai's gaze suddenly fell on a peak behind the Fire Radiance Mountain Range.

Luo Li glanced that way too; understanding Yang Kai's intent, she did not stop him, only warning, “Be careful.”

Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

“Junior Brother, shall I accompany you?” Su Yan asked.

“No need—stay near Senior Luo Li.” Yang Kai waved his hand and his figure flickered; when he next appeared he was a thousand zhang away.

Luo Li's beautiful eyes narrowed slightly.

Only at this moment did she finally understand why Yang Kai had been able to flee under Luo Hai’s pursuit for several months and still remain unharmed.

With that strange speed and footwork, an ordinary Void King Realm expert would have no way to catch him; even she had not noticed how he had moved.

Is this the subtlety of Spatial Force?

An interested expression crossed Luo Li's face as though she wanted to probe the trick, but no matter how she tried she could not sense any detail of the spatial force's mystery—only a blur.

With a slight sigh, Luo Li withdrew her gaze, admitting the spatial force was not something she could fathom, and returned her attention to the Fire Radiance Sect.

At the rear of the Fire Radiance Mountain Range stood a bare, heat-emitting peak about a thousand zhang high.

Looking up from the foot of the mountain one could vaguely see bright firelight at the summit.

It was a volcanic crater, and a highly unstable one; the energy seeping from it carried not only a scorching fire profound intent, but also an overwhelmingly domineering thunder profound intent.

Within the volcano something hideous slumbered; that presence exuded brutality and ferocity that sent chills down the spine.

“So this is the place.” Yang Kai arrived at the mountain's foot, thoughtful.

He had no intention of intervening in the battle between Ice Heart Valley and the Fire Radiance Sect; his goal was the Fire Radiance Sect's Qiantian Thunderflame!

That peerless, deadly flame that even Luo Li feared.

It was said that the thing had become sentient and developed its own will, making it extremely difficult to handle.

From his Divine Sense Yang Kai perceived that the entire volcanic peak was surrounded by numerous sealing arrays and formations of considerable potency.

Yang Kai fixed his gaze on a spot in the void and grinned, “Why hide—show yourselves openly.”

At his words a cold snort echoed from the spot; the air rippled and two figures emerged eerily from the wavering air.

It was as if they had stepped out from another world.

The two were both old, their hair and beards white, but their cultivation reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Their Saint Yuan was blazing fire; the left one was lanky, the right had dark-red skin. Both wore expressions of calm authority, clearly holding high status within the Fire Radiance Sect.

“Boy, who are you?” the lanky elder stared at Yang Kai and asked coldly.

“Who I am is none of your concern. I came to claim the Qiantian Thunderflame. If you two gentlemen are agreeable, perhaps you'll tell me how to break the formations and seals atop the peak?” Yang Kai smiled and looked ahead.

“You insolent brat!” the gaunt elder roared in fury. “Do you think the Fire Radiance Sect’s Qiantian Thunderflame is something you can covet? Considering that your cultivation hasn’t come easily and that you’ve reached such strength at a young age, leave at once, and the two of us will not trouble you!”

He sounded conciliatory, not planning to slay Yang Kai outright for trespassing into the sect's forbidden ground.

“How kind of you, sir!” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and sneered. He lightly stomped his right foot and said coldly, “Is that what you call not troubling me?”

Boom……

As Yang Kai's right foot touched the ground, the earth cracked; a fissure opened from his toe and ran toward the two elders.

In that crevice two pure, hidden flaming energies gathered and flowed silently, creeping toward Yang Kai's position until they were less than three chi away.

Like two venomous snakes hidden in the earth, ready to strike.

“You boastful child—how dare you show your face!” the lanky elder snarled when Yang Kai uncovered his trick. He shed all pretense and unleashed his Saint Yuan. The dormant fire energy in the ground roared to life, coalescing into a giant flaming python that lunged to swallow Yang Kai.

“Mere petty tricks, and you dare to flaunt them before me?” Yang Kai laughed heartily. In an instant, the Dragon Bone Sword, Dripping Jade, appeared in his hand. With a casual swing, a flash of emerald light swept forth, and the ferocious, sky-rending fiery python let out a shrill hiss before being cleaved in two, dissolving into countless specks of light that vanished from sight.

A formidable foe indeed! The two elders exchanged a look and their faces turned grave.
