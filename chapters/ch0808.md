## Chapter 808 — Thundertree Palace

From their first contact, Yang Kai could tell that although this Kuang Shi had awakened its mind, its thinking wasn’t particularly sharp; like many of the yao, it often acted on instinct.

After all, it had taken form from the body of a demonic beast, so this was understandable.

Such creatures wore their likes and dislikes plainly on their faces, with no schemes; sometimes they were easy to get along with, and other times they could turn vicious in an instant—if it liked you, it would be friendly; if offended, it would strike.

In a way, Yang Kai found this kind of straightforwardness rather interesting.

So when he faced Kuang Shi, there was nothing awkward or unnatural about him.

“Hmph, very well. I’ll take you to Thundertree Palace, but whether the Great Lord will see you isn’t for me to decide.” Kuang Shi mulled it over for a long while before finally agreeing with a single reply.

“Thank you.” Yang Kai secretly breathed easier, knowing he had earned the beast’s approval.

Thundertree Palace… he didn’t know precisely what it was, but he could faintly guess it was where a Great Yao Lord resided.

Not a bad name, in any case.

Once Kuang Shi agreed, it wasted no time and set off at once with Yang Kai, repeatedly warning him not to try any tricks or he’d get what was coming.

Yang Kai replied with a neutral agreement.

Only now did Yang Kai realize how vast the Beast Sea Great Forest truly was: tens of thousands of demonic beasts lived here, from newly born cubs to experts who had already taken humanoid form, representing almost every yao species.

Places where yao clustered like this were rare within the Yao Realm; there were only a few such locations, each overseen by a Great Yao Lord.

Human Territory, Yao Realm, Demon Domain—the humans held the most land, followed by the Demon Domain, with the Yao Realm occupying the smallest area.

Yet the Beast Sea Great Forest alone took up a full tenth of the Yao Realm.

To go from here to Thundertree Palace required at least three days’ travel.

Three days there and three days back, six days round trip—time-wise it was feasible, so Yang Kai wasn’t in a hurry; he flew behind Kuang Shi at a steady pace, taking in the sickeningly rich abundance of the thicket.

Through Divine Sense he sensed rare ores and Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine growing brazenly within the forest, left untapped. Occasionally some demonic beasts simply swallowed these precious herbs whole—chewing them like cud and gulping them down—and seeing that made Yang Kai feel like spitting blood.

If those materials were refined into pills, their potency would multiply several times over; they were far more valuable used in alchemy than swallowed raw.

This wasn’t the time to harp on it, though. Yang Kai felt regret but said little, instead repeatedly praising the Beast Sea Great Forest’s bounty.

Those words pleased Kuang Shi. After a day together it found the human rather agreeable; his praise sounded right to the beast’s ear.

When Yang Kai gifted it a few Secret Treasures suited to its use, Kuang Shi immediately warmed toward him.

The Saint-Grade Secret Treasures Yang Kai had obtained in the Sacred Tomb were things he could never casually give away—each item was priceless.

If he were to give such treasures, he’d do so only to those closest to him.

However, he had accumulated many Secret Treasures of middling rank; when he and An Ling'er had gone to sea, they had recovered some from an ancient ruin beneath the waves, and these were handy for favors.

Kuang Shi cradled the Secret Treasures and pills in its arms, suddenly acting obsequious.

When Yang Kai now called it Brother Kuang or friend, it no longer bristled.

The journey was uneventful. With Kuang Shi as escort, any yao experts they roused along the way generally left them alone; when they learned Yang Kai was the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, curiosity displaced hostility and they let him pass.

Perhaps without the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, things would be less pleasant for them.

In the past, the old Saint Lord used to bring large amounts of spirit stones, Spirit-Grade Pills, and Secret Treasures periodically, but in the last two years they had seen nothing of the sort and naturally missed those days.

On the third day, a towering ancient tree that pierced the clouds suddenly came into view.

The tree rose like a mountain peak into the heavens; its massive canopy cast shade for dozens of li, its sprawling trunk thick with dense growth.

Yang Kai was stunned.

At first he thought his eyes were playing tricks, but after a careful look he realized it was truly a single tree.

It was simply enormous.

The world held every wonder—compared with the Divine Tree in the Black Book Space, this one made that tree seem like a three-year-old child.

Kuang Shi noticed Yang Kai’s expression, bobbed its head proudly and said, “See that? That’s Thundertree Palace—the residence where the Great Lord and our strongest yao live. The Great Lord dwells in a wooden house at the very top.”

“Why is it called Thundertree Palace?” Yang Kai asked, curious.

Kuang Shi snorted, “That’s a ten-thousand-year Thunder-Devouring Tree that draws the power of the Nine Heavens’ lightning. Our Great Lord’s true body is a noble Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon; cultivation requires lightning, so living here is perfect.”

“It draws lightning?” Yang Kai was astonished. “Wouldn’t that affect others living inside?”

“The Great Lord’s methods are beyond your imagination. The nine-heavens lightning drawn from the sky is absorbed only by the Great Lord and will not harm others.” Kuang Shi explained proudly. “Of course, a few also need lightning for cultivation; the Great Lord apportions some to them.”

During the trip Yang Kai had noticed how much Kuang Shi revered that Great Lord; anything related to the Great Lord drew obeisance from the beast.

Faced with such pride and reverence, Yang Kai was unmoved—he merely nodded and said, “I see. Your Great Lord truly is formidable.”

“Indeed.” Kuang Shi chuckled. “I wonder if this Kuang Shi will ever reach such heights in this lifetime. Enough talk—follow me, we’re nearly there.”

Yang Kai nodded and matched its pace.

Before long they arrived at the base of that massive ancient tree.

The moment he stepped there, Yang Kai felt numerous divine-sense inspections locking onto him from all sides, seeping into his skin like mercury, as if they intended to examine him inside and out.

Yang Kai’s expression remained calm; he let them probe without resistance, his eyes coolly sweeping the surroundings.

Beneath the ancient tree many demonic beasts were prostrate; each was fierce in appearance and muscular in build.

Purpleback Blood Spiders, Gold-Line Steel Tortoises, Green-Phosphor Leopards, Scarlet-Flowered Martens… every kind of beast, named and unnamed, was present.

Drawn by Yang Kai’s aura, those beasts rose from their resting places and glared hungrily in his direction; their beastly eyes met and divine senses passed among them as if exchanging thoughts.

Yang Kai felt a chill and knew these beasts were not comparable to the ones he had met deeper in the forest.

These demonic beasts clearly possessed considerable intelligence, no less than Kuang Shi, and each was of Seventh-Tier or above.

Yang Kai guessed they might be yao experts who had not taken humanoid form or who preferred to retain their beast bodies.

Under that manyfold gaze Yang Kai remained composed, his calm demeanor drawing even more attention.

Kuang Shi that had brought him here looked slightly restrained and, chuckling foolishly, greeted those around it before telling Yang Kai, “Wait here; I’ll report to Lady Caidie and ask whether we may see the Great Lord.”

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

Kuang Shi leapt up toward the tree and shortly disappeared into the canopy.

Yang Kai stood waiting, surrounded by powerful demonic beasts that paced around him like an unwelcome guest who’d overstayed his welcome.

He had been prepared for this.

Rustle, rustle, rustle…

A sound came from above, and several imposing figures alighted on the trunk, looking down at Yang Kai with mocking eyes.

Hearing the noise, Yang Kai raised his head and couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

They were several yao experts who had taken humanoid form like Kuang Shi, dressed crudely and still evidencing animal traits.

The middle-aged man on the left had a furry tail, a square face and a mane around his jaw—his true form appeared to be an ape.

On the right stood a woman of graceful figure; long white legs and a flat belly were exposed, a small saber tooth glinted at the corner of her mouth, and two small charming cat ears perched on her temples—her true form was a tiger or cat.

Yang Kai watched them with interest.

They merely observed Yang Kai; they seemed unwilling to trouble him. One with cat ears looked notably intrigued, murmuring to herself while that saber tooth lent her expression a sharper edge.

Eyes met and Yang Kai gave a slight nod; the yao experts smirked with pursed lips.

All of a sudden, a shrill scream came from above the ancient tree; at the sound, Yang Kai’s brows knit.

It was clearly Kuang Shi who had led him here, shouting as if it had been beaten and was tumbling down from above.

With a crackling sound, Kuang Shi’s huge body crashed through countless branches and fell heavily to the ground, smashing out a deep pit under the weight.

“How dare you bring a human to Thundertree Palace at will—Kuang Shi, do you fancy living long? If not, I’ll send you on your way right now!” a sharp voice suddenly scolded from above; with the rebuke a dazzling multicolored radiance flashed before Yang Kai, and a beautiful silhouette appeared suspended in midair—though scolding Kuang Shi, her eyes fixed on Yang Kai like blades.
