## Chapter 873 — That Kid Has Returned

“If that day really comes, then it’ll only be my own fault…” Yang Kai looked at Wu Zheng with a faint gaze, his patience wearing thin.

This fellow seemed to be picking on him in particular, which naturally put Yang Kai in a bad mood, and the man was meddlesome to boot.

Chu Yi cleared his throat and spoke up in a clear voice, "Saint Lord Yang, your Nine Heavens Sacred Land has long been a flagship of human power, standing proud and prosperous for thousands of years. I have heard that during the war against the demons, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land also earned no small share of merit! I have likewise heard much of the reputation of Elder Xu Hui. Now that the Sacred Land is in your hands, I must ask — why would a sect leader of your stature willingly entangle yourself with demonfolk? Since ancient times humans and demons have not coexisted... you understand that, Saint Lord Yang, don't you?"

"I understand, of course," Yang Kai said with a light nod. "But the demonfolk under my command were sealed inside a Small Xuan Realm for thousands of years. It wasn't until some days ago, when I accidentally entered that realm, that I discovered them and brought them out. After being cut off from the outside world for so long, any enmity between humans and demons has long since faded. Please rest assured, elders — I can guarantee they will not do anything to harm humanity."

"A Small Xuan Realm?"

"Sealed for thousands of years?"

"Is that true?"

Murmurs of astonishment rippled through the crowd. Many looked at Yang Kai with envy, wondering how they had never discovered such a Small Xuan Realm themselves; had they found it, perhaps they could have amassed such powerful subordinates.

Yang Kai turned his gaze to Li Rong. She answered in a grave tone, "Indeed — our faction was sealed away for thousands of years and only reemerged two months ago. We once swore in the name of the Great Demon God to serve only our master in this life and follow his commands. We have no desire to meddle in the enmity between humans and demons; all we seek now is merely a place to live."

Chu Yi was moved, and he stared at Li Rong for a long moment.

He knew well the status of the Great Demon God among the demonfolk. No demon would lightly swear by that name.

Seeing Li Rong speak with such solemnity, Chu Yi found himself inclined to believe her words.

"There are places for you to dwell within the Demon Domain; there's no need to insist on staying in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land," Fang Yuebai frowned. "Since you are demons, you should return to the Demon Domain — that is your homeland."

"We cannot go back." Yang Kai gave a short, mirthless laugh.

"Why not?"

"Because not long ago they fought with the demon general Xueli and beat her so badly she fled injured. If they returned to the Demon Domain, wouldn't that be walking straight into a snare?"

"Demon General Xueli?"

"She was injured?"

"When did this happen?"

"Who wounded her?"

Again the crowd erupted in shocked exclamations; many were stunned and disbelieving.

Yang Kai shrugged. "They made an enemy of Xueli, so they can't return to the Demon Domain... and in another sense, the fact they could go after a demon general shows that although demon blood runs in their veins, they are enemies of the demonfolk. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, isn't that so?"

Fang Yuebai and Chu Yi exchanged a glance and both nodded slightly.

Chu Yi said, "If things are truly as you say, that could be plausible. I'd like to believe you, Saint Lord Yang, but the details will need to be investigated."

"If Elder Chu wants to inquire, I suggest you visit the Tianxiao Sect. During the night they fought Xueli, the sect's founder Chu Lingxiao was present; it was his actions that led to Xueli's injury."

"So it was that person from the Tianxiao Sect!" Chu Yi's eyes brightened as realization dawned. He nodded seriously. "I'll go to the Tianxiao Sect."

Yang Kai chuckled. "In short, although I have gathered many demonfolk under my command, I repeat: they will not harm humanity. But if anyone dares to look for trouble, don't blame this Saint Lord for being impolite."

Wu Zheng snorted coldly, displeased. He thought Yang Kai's tone arrogant, as if he looked down on others.

"Well then, are you all satisfied? If so, please disperse — I'm sorry to have had you chase after me for so many days. Or, if you wish, you may come stay in my Nine Heavens Sacred Land for a while; you are practically at our doorstep now." Yang Kai waved.

Chu Yi heard this and smiled wryly, shaking his head. "No need. I heard your Sacred Land is now occupied by a Great Yao Lord; Saint Lord Yang, you should consider how to deal with the trouble at hand. But one more thing, Saint Lord Yang —"

"Speak, Elder Chu."

"Keep a strict leash on these demonfolk under your command. They may not be as obedient as they appear; if they commit some atrocity one day, it will tarnish the reputation of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land."

"Thank you for the warning. I will keep a close eye on them."

Chu Yi nodded slowly, his expression complex as he glanced at Yang Kai and then at Li Rong before turning away.

Fang Yuebai thought for a moment, then nodded at Yang Kai and followed after.

Once the two elders left, more than half of the human experts dispersed at once.

Only the flushed-faced Wu Zheng remained, staring coldly at Yang Kai and Li Rong with resentment. The human experts left behind wore wary, distrustful expressions.

Yang Kai knew that people like Chu Yi and Fang Yuebai were reasonable and, after some discussion, would leave.

But Wu Zheng and the others who stayed clearly harbored hatred toward other races; they were uneasy about letting demons occupy human territory.

Even though the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had nothing to do with them.

Put politely, they claimed to care for the world and its people; put bluntly, they were meddlesome busybodies.

"Boy, I hope you really can keep them in check, or the consequences will be severe." Wu Zheng left with a parting barb and rancor.

A great number of people walked away. Yang Kai waved and smiled faintly. "Let's go back."

Li Rong followed closely behind.

Not far off, the human experts looked reluctant. One of them said to Wu Zheng, "Elder Wu, are we really going to let those demonfolk stay in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land? They're a menace; trouble will happen sooner or later."

"What can we do? The Sacred Land's Saint Lord has accepted them. What can outsiders like us say? At most we'll cut off contact and isolate them later." Wu Zheng snorted. Most of those present had never dealt with the Sacred Land; he ground his teeth and said, "Chu Yi and Fang Yuebai don't want to get involved — can't you see?"

“Senior Chu and Senior Fang are keeping to themselves, that’s understandable. But Senior Wu, you’re clearly different from them. If you really want to deal with those Demons, I have a plan—perhaps it might help.” One man gave a sly grin.

“Oh?” Wu Zheng raised an eyebrow. “Let’s hear it!”

“Senior Chu and Senior Fang didn’t want to interfere because those Demons haven’t caused trouble yet. But given their nature, it’s only a matter of time. Rather than wait, why don’t we give them a little push? If they dare kill or injure someone, then the human experts won’t be able to sit idly by. At that time not only will Senior Chu and Senior Fang have to step in, but even more powerful experts will be drawn in!”

Wu Zheng’s eyes lit up, secretly thinking the idea reasonable. He urged, “Explain in detail.”

The man said gleefully, “There are plenty who despise demons in this world. All we need do is spread the word that there are demons in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Do you think no one will come looking for trouble? Once or twice they may endure, and that brat surnamed Yang may restrain them, but if it happens often enough, they’ll surely lash out. And once they do… heh heh!”

Another chimed in: “That’s right. And I hear the Nine Heavens Sacred Land currently has many rare Demonic Beasts. Their hides, blood, Inner Cores, and claws are all excellent materials for artifact refining… I’m sure many would be interested in that.”

Wu Zheng arched his brow, glancing sidelong at the two with a sinister grin. “Cunning indeed!”

“Senior Wu flatters us.” The two laughed awkwardly.

“Then hurry and spread the word. No need to exaggerate—just tell it as it is. But hide the cultivation and numbers of the experts there, or you’ll scare people off from coming.” Wu Zheng sneered coldly.

“Wise insight, Senior Wu!”

......

Back at the temporary lodging of the Ancient Demon Clan, Han Fei and Hua Mo and the others immediately gathered to inquire about the situation.

"A pack of busybodies; don't pay them any mind!" Li Rong said indifferently, then looked at Yang Kai. "But Master, that Great Yao Lord still seems to be over there — how do you plan to handle him? Every Great Lord of the yao is not someone to be trifled with."

"Hmm, you stay here and wait. I still have to go over and speak with that Great Lord." Yang Kai frowned.

Inviting a deity is easy, but sending one off is hard. Last time they had no choice but to provoke the Great Yao Lord into coming, and this time Yang Kai wasn't sure he'd be able to get him to leave.

If it didn't go smoothly, they might end up scrambling for a fight.

Although the strength he currently commanded meant he had no real fear of the yao, an open conflict would be hard to settle — after all they'd still be neighbors afterward, with the Beast Sea Great Forest nearby.

After resting briefly, Yang Kai set out again with Li Rong toward the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Half a day later, within a palace of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, the Great Yao Lord who had been meditating on the Dao opened his deep, starry eyes and focused in a direction.

Those deep, star-like eyes seemed to pierce countless barriers and instantly located Yang Kai and Li Rong.

Yang Kai, who was walking, halted and grinned, looking into the void.

Li Rong's delicate face grew grave as she stared at that stretch of space, Demon Yuan churning quietly within her.

After a long moment, the Great Lord in the hall withdrew his divine awareness and slowly shook his head.

"Great Lord, what's happened?" Caidie asked suspiciously from the side of the hall.

"That stinking brat has returned," the Great Lord chuckled. "Looks like he's come to take back the Nine Heavens Sacred Land."

Caidie frowned slightly. "You mean... Yang Kai?"

"Who else could it be?" the Great Lord nodded faintly.
