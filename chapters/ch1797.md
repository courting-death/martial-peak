## Chapter 1797 — Fortune Turns

It seemed that the attack which had grievously wounded him earlier had indeed been formed from a Divine Bird's feather!

As that thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind, his expression turned grim. While circulating his Saint Yuan to forcibly suppress his wounds, he simultaneously urged his Golden Blood Threads to weave a shield of golden blood behind him.

At the same time, he circulated the Undying Five Elements Sword.

In an instant, multicolored radiance flickered outside Yang Kai's body; within the light countless fine, hair-thin sword qi crisscrossed, and the sound of ten thousand swords resonating could be faintly heard.

Even with the toughness of his flesh-and-blood body, he had been unable to withstand a single strike from a Divine Bird's feather before—it had pierced him from chest through to back—so facing so many Divine Bird feathers this time, how could he dare to be reckless?

In an instant he put every defensive measure he had into play.

No sooner had he finished than a void-shredding sound came from behind, a noise that made his insides tremble.

For that moment Yang Kai felt like a one-man boat riding a towering sea, tossed and battered, rising and falling as if it might capsize at any instant; it was a sensation of life hanging by a thread.

In the face of such enormous danger, Yang Kai was unusually calm; his perception sharpened beyond its normal limits.

He danced left and right amid that terrifying onslaught, doing his utmost to avoid the strikes of the Divine Bird's feathers.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Attack after attack skimmed his body and flew off to the side; occasionally one grazed him, causing the multicolored radiance of the Undying Five Elements Sword to dim considerably.

Time had never seemed to crawl so slowly—yet at the same time, it felt like only the blink of an eye. By the time the sound of the air being torn apart finally faded, Yang Kai was nearly completely spent.

Boom…

Another attack came from behind, and out of the corner of his eye Yang Kai glimpsed seven-colored light.

Seven Luminaries Divine Light!

Yang Kai's expression darkened as he realized there was truly nowhere left to evade; he had already expended enormous spirit and energy dodging the Divine Bird's feathers, and at such a critical moment for the Divine Bird to unleash the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, it nearly extinguished any remaining hope of escape.

At the turning point of danger a flash of inspiration struck Yang Kai; he hurriedly produced the Xuan Realm Pearl and, with a flick of his body, vanished from where he stood.

He dove straight into the Xuan Realm Pearl!

In the next instant, the Seven Luminaries Divine Light enveloped the Xuan Realm Pearl! Though the Divine Light’s power was boundless, how could it possibly harm an Imperial Treasure in the slightest? The Xuan Realm Pearl only paused for a moment before shooting off into the distance like an arrow released from the bowstring.

Meanwhile, the Divine Bird that had been relentlessly pursuing Yang Kai showed an almost human look of astonishment.

Previously, no matter how Yang Kai fled or how he used spatial power, it could precisely lock onto his direction and easily pursue; but this time, after Yang Kai produced the Xuan Realm Pearl, it completely lost his trail.

However, the Divine Bird was still a divine creature—its intelligence was high; although it did not know what was special about the Xuan Realm Pearl, it understood that Yang Kai's disappearance was surely linked to that pearl.

So it cried out and sped forward at tremendous speed, intent on swallowing the Xuan Realm Pearl into its maw.

Yang Kai was not about to let it; after using the Xuan Realm Pearl to dodge the Seven Luminaries Divine Light for a moment, he quickly emerged from it, seized the Imperial Treasure, and continued to flee!

The Divine Bird, mocked by Yang Kai in this way, flew into a rage; its feathers bristled as if it were about to rend Yang Kai to pieces.

But at that instant an anomaly arose.

Within the Star Domain a profoundly mysterious force began to spread, gradually growing denser. Strangely, this sudden power clung tightly around the Divine Bird like a binding curse, impossible to shake off, while it had no effect at all on Yang Kai who was fleeing not far ahead.

This strange force strengthened with alarming speed.

In scarcely more than a dozen breaths a patch of purple thundercloud appeared above the Divine Bird's head; purple arcs of lightning slithered through that cloud like spiritual snakes, its might unfathomable. The purple thundercloud hovered above the Divine Bird like a shadow and followed it; no matter how the Divine Bird moved it could not escape, just as it had relentlessly pursued Yang Kai.

For the first time the Divine Bird showed signs of apprehension and cried out rapidly.

Yang Kai, though unaware of what had happened behind him, sensed that something was amiss; but at that moment he had no leisure to look back, he could only run as hard as he could.

Crack…

A sound rang through the Star Domain into Yang Kai's ears, and in that instant his spirit trembled; his already wounded body went even paler and he spat a mouthful of Golden Blood.

Behind him the Divine Bird shrieked in fury as a purple bolt of lightning struck its massive body.

A scorched smell immediately filled the air; even a Divine Bird as mighty and resplendent as a Seven Luminaries Peacock was jolted by that purple lightning, several of its variegated feathers falling away.

The speed of its pursuit was greatly reduced!

Crack…

A second crack sounded and a second purple bolt struck.

The Divine Bird was struck again, screaming all the more in anger and beating its wings more fiercely, yet it still could not resist the harassment of the purple thundercloud.

Crack…

The third bolt…

Yang Kai had charged forward several thousand li and felt that he was at a safe distance; only then did he have the leisure to glance back, and at that sight he was overjoyed beyond measure.

He could clearly see that the once dreadful Divine Bird, which had driven its prey to desperate flight, was now locked in combat with terrifying Heavenly Might.

His first thought crossed his mind: was the Divine Bird making a breakthrough, ascending to the next boundary? After all, the purple thundercloud gathered above its head looked so much like a Baptism of Heavenly Might.

But then Yang Kai quickly dismissed that idea.

The Divine Bird's strength was already fearsome and its realm profound; for such an existence to make a breakthrough was not a simple matter—it might spend thousands or even tens of thousands of years without any improvement—there was no reason it should suddenly break through at such a time.

Moreover, Yang Kai had not sensed any strengthening of the Divine Bird's aura—despite how powerful it already was.

If it was not an ascension breakthrough, then how should this scene be explained?

As he pondered, Yang Kai's eyes brightened and he hit upon a major possibility; he burst into a gleeful laugh, the previous depression swept away and a great relief filled his heart.

"No mistake, it's definitely the expulsion of the laws of Heaven and Earth!" Yang Kai's eyes shone as he stared toward the Divine Bird, watching it struggle and wail under the purple thundercloud, feeling as if Heaven itself were favoring him—at such a crucial moment it came to impede the Divine Bird's pursuit.

The laws of Heaven and Earth were a strange, ineffable and exceedingly profound force; at the very least, cultivators of the Void King Realm could not touch the power of those laws. Even becoming the Star Lord of a Cultivation Star only allowed one a vague sense of that star's laws, a minor ability to manipulate it for one's use and many conveniences afforded to a Star Lord.

The laws of Heaven and Earth would expel anything that did not belong to that piece of heaven and earth.

For example, the law of the Dark Star was simple—it rejected beings of the Void King Realm.

When Qian Tong ascended to the Void King Realm and returned to the Dark Star he had thought he could become peerless there, but he was instead driven mad by the Dark Star's law—it rained down thunder tribulations and fire tribulations upon him from time to time, tormenting him so that he dared not even close himself in seclusion to train.

Moreover that expelling force grew stronger and stronger; if he did not leave soon he would be worn down to death.

In desperation he had begged Yang Kai to take him away from the Dark Star.

Qian Tong's situation should be the same as what the Divine Bird was experiencing now.

The Divine Bird did not belong to this Star Domain; its very existence challenged the authority of the Star Domain's laws, so it was being expelled—the purple thundercloud was the most direct manifestation of the law's rejection of it.

The Divine Bird might withstand this expulsion once, but it might not be able to withstand it a second time.

Because this was the Star Domain itself rejecting the creature's existence, not the subtler degree of rejection Qian Tong had suffered on the Dark Star; that kind of expulsion was not comparable to what the Divine Bird now faced.

Yang Kai had recalled Qian Tong's plight and that was why he had formed his inference about the scene before him.

Although he could not be completely certain, he was at least eighty percent confident.

Watching the scene in the distance, Yang Kai felt much calmer.

With no Divine Bird in pursuit, why should he panic? He simply stood in the void, withdrew a few Spiritual Pills for healing from his Spatial Ring and shoved them into his mouth, healing while he looked on.

At that distant spot the violet hue grew dense; accompanied by successive crackling sounds, bolt after bolt of purple lightning descended, and no matter how the Divine Bird dodged the strikes, each lightning bolt struck it with precision—each blow seeming to inflict some injury.

After dozens of strikes the Divine Bird grew somewhat panicked.

It sensed that the purple bolts were increasing in strength with every fall; although it could withstand them for the moment, if the barrage continued it might truly fall here.

Although the Everlasting Tree was precious, in comparison with its own life it was merely an external object.

It naturally knew how to choose.

After withstanding one more bolt's power the Divine Bird dared not linger, promptly turning its massive body and returning along its original path.

It also felt the Star Domain's rejecting force; it knew what to do to be safe, and so it decided to return to its nest at once.

“Eh? The Divine Bird has turned back!” Up ahead, two streaks of light were speeding rapidly in this direction—it was none other than Zi Long, his son Zi Donglai, and Xu Wei, who had gone ahead earlier.

Zi Donglai, upon seeing the Divine Bird's enormous body, exclaimed and, pondering, said, "Could that brat have been killed by the Divine Bird?"

Zi Long did not reply; instead he fixed his gaze on the purple thundercloud above the Divine Bird and, when he sensed the terrifying power contained within it, his face changed and he quickly altered course to avoid the Divine Bird.

But the Divine Bird was now seething with rage—how could it allow Zi Long to simply leave?

Its great beak opened and the Seven Luminaries Divine Light spewed forth, covering Zi Long and the other two.

Zi Donglai let out a cry and his face turned as white as paper.

Zi Long and Xu Wei, however, wore grim expressions as they each unleashed their own techniques, scrambling in haste to dodge—their movements utterly disheveled and frantic.

By the time they finally managed to avoid the blow, the Divine Bird was already far away, thousands of li in the distance.
