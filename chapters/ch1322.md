## Chapter 1322 — Battle with the Origin Returning Realm

With the Origin Returning Realm expert striking at full force, Yang Kai was naturally affected—his body froze for an instant, and in that brief moment, a barrage of overwhelming attacks surged toward him. Wang Yuhan and the others had seized the chance to strike. Among their assaults were Martial Skills and the powers of Secret Treasures, each unleashed in fury, carrying the clear intent to kill Yang Kai on the spot.

If Yang Kai died, those two women would pose no threat to them at all.

Facing such a fierce onslaught, Yang Kai merely flipped his hand, and a violet-shimmering shield appeared in his grasp. At once, it erupted with dense auras of wind and earth. A sudden gale and surge of sand rose from the ground, and in an instant, a miniature sandstorm formed around the three of them, completely obscuring their figures!

With a thunderous roar, the incoming attacks and Secret Treasure energies slammed into the sandstorm and could not penetrate it for even a fraction. Everything was swallowed by the tempest.

Seeing this, Wang Yuhan's expression turned icy. He had seen Yang Kai use this Origin-Grade Upper-Level shield Secret Treasure back in Zangxiong Valley and thus knew its exceptional nature. Now that it had been employed personally in the fight, he understood all the more how formidable its defense was.

A defensive Secret Treasure like that, so long as its wielder's Saint Yuan did not run dry, was not something a handful of Saint King Realm cultivators could break. Wrapped inside that sandstorm, Yang Kai and the others were already standing on unassailable ground.

"Good!" Elder Wang's eyes lit up, excitement flashing across his face as he exclaimed, "I'll take that Secret Treasure!"

As he spoke, a great hand formed from his Saint Yuan and shot forth toward where Yang Kai and the others hid. The five fingers fell like five mountain peaks; even before the palm truly gripped the sandstorm, it gave off the sensation of commanding heaven and earth.

At the same moment, an almost imperceptible glint of gold shot out from inside the sandstorm, instantly unfolding into countless golden threads that snaked and cut through the air.

The Wang elder's gigantic Saint Yuan palm lasted less than a breath before it was sliced to pieces by those golden threads and shattered with a roar. With the threat gone, the golden strands vanished at that instant.

Before Wang Yuhan and the others could react, the golden threads had already flickered over to them and, spreading until they blotted out the sky, wove themselves into a massive net that enveloped the Saint King Realm cultivators.

"Beware the golden threads!" Elder Wang warned urgently, pressing his Shi against the strands.

To his horror, the threads were not hindered at all; instead they shredded his pressure into fragments, making it impossible for his Shi to take shape.

"Impossible!" Elder Wang's face changed dramatically as recollection struck; he cried out in alarm, "The Demon Blood Threads technique! This is the Demon Blood Sect's Demon Blood Threads technique. You are of the Demon Blood Sect!"

He had finally recalled the origin of those threads from what he had seen and heard. What baffled him was why the Demon Blood Threads were golden — he had heard they were red.

The Demon Blood Threads technique was one of the few arts on Dark Star that could break a cultivator's Shi.

"Whether I'm of the Demon Blood Sect is none of your concern!" Yang Kai's figure remained concealed within the sandstorm. His expression was indifferent as the golden strands obeyed his will like an extension of his arm, suddenly covering Wang Yuhan and the other Saint King Realm cultivators.

At the same time his Divine Sense stirred and a vague command was issued.

Wang Yuhan and the others were Saint King Second or Third Stage cultivators; they were by no means weak. Seeing Elder Wang act as if facing a major threat, they immediately attempted to deploy their strongest defenses, and one or two of them even began to cast secret techniques, preparing to evade.

What terrified them was that before they could complete any maneuver, a sudden, violent pain erupted within their Sea of Consciousness, unsettling their minds. Their gathered Saint Yuan and Secret Treasures could not be summoned. They could only watch, paralyzed, as the golden threads descended upon their heads.

A series of hissing sounds rose and the golden strands flashed away, drawn back in by Yang Kai.

Wang Yuhan and the other Saint King Realm cultivators stood frozen in place, eyes filled with terror as if they had witnessed something beyond belief.

"Yuhan!" Elder Wang called out in a trembling voice.

"Seventh Grandfather…" Wang Yuhan answered, pleading in his tone. Before he could finish the sentence his body suddenly fell apart, becoming a puddle of shredded flesh.

A sickening splatter echoed through the air.

The other Saint King Realm men were broken likewise, as if mirrors shattered; their bodies disintegrated and the wounds were unnaturally clean and smooth, as though sliced by some invisible blade.

With a single strike, those Saint King cultivators all perished.

The scene was grotesque beyond words, the stench of blood rising into the heavens.

Elder Wang gazed at the place where Wang Yuhan had fallen, staring at the neatly severed limbs and shredded corpses. In an instant his eyes reddened with murderous rage.

He could barely accept what he saw.

The other side was only a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm — how could he possess the power to instantly kill so many opponents not inferior to himself? It felt like a dream. After staring in stunned silence for a moment, he suddenly whirled to look at where Yang Kai stood and ground his teeth as he bellowed, "Brat, you dare kill my grandson — what trickery have you used!"

"Trickery?" Yang Kai sneered. With a flick of his hand the sandstorm that had concealed him dispersed, revealing his form. He cast a mocking look at the elder and said coldly, "You'll know once you're dead."

"Ignorant child, you think you can kill an elder like me!" Elder Wang snapped and then laughed. His Saint Yuan roiled and his eyes turned murderous; Wang Yuhan's death had driven him into a blind, raging fury.

As he spoke, a small yellow bell appeared in his hand — only palm-sized and seemingly unremarkable. Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and did not dare to underestimate it.

This man possessed Origin Returning Realm strength. He had deployed a Secret Treasure against a mere Second Stage Saint King Realm opponent; despite his rage, he was clearly prepared to go all out.

As Yang Kai braced against whatever strange power the small bell might possess, the elder flicked his wrist and a bell-tone rang out. The sound entered Yang Kai's ears and his heartbeat thumped wildly; his blood rushed and an uncontrollable ferocity began to crawl through his body.

"My Soul-Burying Bell has never been used on Saint King Realm cultivators before — to die under this bell is your honor!" Elder Wang snarled through his teeth as he gave the yellow bell another gentle shake.

The tone reached Yang Kai again and his heart leapt once more; the rhythm was strange and grotesquely exaggerated. After two beats he felt a violent pain in his chest, as if his heart were about to burst.

Yang Kai's face went pale. He immediately understood not to underestimate any Origin Returning Realm cultivator, especially those of advanced age; though their cultivation might not progress, their methods of killing only grew more numerous and more arcane with age.

He forced his Saint Yuan to suppress the chest pain and the rising ferocity. The Hundred Mountains Painting was already invoked; ghostly mountain peaks shot out to strike Elder Wang.

The thunder of the impact was unending, yet Elder Wang treated the mountain phantoms as nothing. He spat forth a pitch-black small flag that unfurled in the wind and suddenly expanded into an area a dozen or so zhang across, shielding above his head. When the mountain phantoms fell, strange, featureless specters burst from the flag and slammed into the peaks, preventing them from descending even an inch.

"Brat, use every trick you’ve got — I’ll kill you and teach you a lesson!" Elder Wang roared, wild with confidence that he had Yang Kai cornered.

Yang Kai sneered again, "Old dog, are you mistaken? I'm not fighting you alone!"

"You still expect those two little girls…" Elder Wang jeered, looking toward Qian Yue and Yang Yan with derision. Before he could finish his sentence his expression changed: Yang Yan had produced an exquisitely crafted, pagoda-shaped Secret Treasure and tossed it lightly into the air; it promptly hovered.

The pagoda had seven tiers. Each level radiated a different color; the seven-tiered tower began to spin in midair, each layer turning in a different direction and at different speeds. As it spun, a beautiful melody suddenly rang out across the heavens.

The music was exquisitely beautiful, as if several musicians were playing different instruments in flawless harmony. Interwoven with the tune was an invisible power that dispersed Yang Kai's ferocity, drove away his chest pain, and even drowned out the Burial Soul Bell's tone.

"A sound attack Secret Treasure!" Elder Wang stared in disbelief, the corners of his eyes twitching.

His Shi was shattered by Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Threads, and the power of his Soul-Burying Bell was being countered by that seven-layered pagoda. He suddenly realized that these people seemed as though they had come specifically to restrain him. Rage surged within him—but alongside it, a growing sense of unease.

Yang Kai had already taken a step forward. His long sword, wrapped in Demonic Flame, cut forth an earth-shattering blade of light as he laughed, "Old dog, because Wang Yuhan was jealous you tried kill me — what a worthy elder you are. Since you've come, you won't be leaving!"

"Arrogant brat!" Elder Wang would not be cowed by the sword light. His Saint Yuan surged and with one hand he pushed forward, shattering the sword beam.

But the next moment he felt a sharp pain in his Sea of Consciousness, as though something inside were wreaking havoc. His face changed and alarm spread through him.

He had no time to probe his Sea of Consciousness before a pitch-black, sword-like attack struck. He again thrust his great hand forward to break the blow as he had moments before.

The turmoil inside his Sea of Consciousness left him no leisure to inspect the incoming strike. Only when his grasp met the black attack did he realize this was not a mere sword-ray.

He thought to withdraw, but it was too late — the pitch-black attack, as sharp as the keenest blade, sliced through his palm and all the way to his shoulder like a hot knife through butter, without any hindrance.

Half his arm then vanished as if devoured by an invisible beast.
