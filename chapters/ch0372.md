## Chapter 372 — He Won't Bite You

On the second day, a group of people was ready to depart.

No one from Lingxiao Pavilion came to send them off! Jie Hongchen felt too ashamed to appear before Yang Kai again and silently oversaw the reconstruction matters within the sect. 

At this moment, Yang Kai finally realized what Qiu Yimeng meant when she said she wanted to borrow his luck.

The Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle soared in the sky, while Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian each rode a Treading Cloud Steed, looking at Yang Kai with strange expressions and smiles, as if waiting for something.

Frowning at the sight, Yang Kai felt a wave of annoyance.

There were only three Treading Cloud Steeds in their party, with one being ridden by each Blood Servant, and Yang Kai on another. That left Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman with no mounts.

Tang Yuxian could still take another person with her; what about the remaining one?

Both Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman were young ladies. The journey to Zhongdu was long, and there would be some jostling along the way. No matter who rode with Yang Kai, some body contact was definitely unavoidable.

"I’ll ride with Xiaoman; you pick one." Qiu Yimeng said, indifferent, her beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai with a smile.

Her tender smile and sparkling eyes even hinted at some flirtation, making one’s thoughts wander.

Luo Xiaoman also realized the awkwardness of the situation, her face reddening.

Yang Kai grimaced and said, "Yuxian takes one, Tu Feng takes one, and I’ll ride alone."

Qiu Yimeng's smile quickly faded, staring blankly at Yang Kai, seemingly not expecting him to reject such a pleasant opportunity to be close to a beauty.

The two Blood Servants appeared somewhat surprised at his refusal.

Tu Feng laughed heartily, “I don’t mind; I just fear the two young ladies might object.”

Qiu Yimeng shot him a hard glare, causing Tu Feng to immediately quiet down, chuckling awkwardly.

"How about this? I have an idea." Qiu Yimeng’s eyes spun mischievously as she smiled.

"What is it?"

"You can ride with Tu Feng, and then Xiaoman and I can take your steed."

"Dream on!" Yang Kai resolutely rejected. What kind of situation would it be for him to share a Treading Cloud Steed with Tu Feng?

It seemed Qiu Yimeng anticipated his response; with another roll of her eyes, she said, “Then you can ride with Sister Tang!”

Tang Yuxian, who had been enjoying the scene, suddenly looked serious, an awkward expression covering her face. Although Yang Kai was the son of the Yang Family and she was one of the Blood Servants, if he truly wanted to ride together, she wouldn’t refuse, but this felt quite strange.

She felt anxious that Yang Kai might agree too readily.

“No way!” Yang Kai frowned; it suddenly seemed more complicated than he thought.

"This won't do, that won't do. What are you going to do then?" Qiu Yimeng was not anxious, only smiling with a trace of cunning in her eyes. Clearly, she had anticipated this issue yesterday.

Yang Kai remained silent for a long time but could not come up with a good solution.

"Hey, you’re a man; just make a decision! Are we going to just wait here?" Qiu Yimeng urged.

Grinding his teeth, Yang Kai directly mounted his Treading Cloud Steed and reached out a hand below.

Qiu Yimeng’s face brightened, just as she was about to climb up, Yang Kai said, "Luo Xiaoman, you come up!"

Qiu Yimeng’s expression changed instantly, staring in astonishment at Yang Kai, her eyes flashing with embarrassment and frustration. She wished she could tear him to pieces.

However, Luo Xiaoman seemed startled, like a frightened rabbit, repeatedly backing away and waving her hands, "No, no, no! Don’t!"

For some reason, she deeply feared Yang Kai.

"Let’s go!" Yang Kai, growing impatient, retracted his hand and shouted to Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, preparing to gallop away.

"Hey..." Qiu Yimeng quickly grabbed his leg, exclaiming angrily, "How can you be so heartless!"

"What heartless? You're going to Zhongdu; you know it well. If you don’t want to walk by yourself, just hire a carriage," Yang Kai really did not want to argue with her any further.

Qiu Yimeng glared at him, realizing there was no jest in his expression, finally saying after a long pause, "Then Xiaoman can go up."

"I... I... I'm scared!" Luo Xiaoman looked like she might cry.

"Scared of what? He won't bite you." Qiu Yimeng said dismissively, grabbing Luo Xiaoman's arm and, amidst her screams, tossed her onto Yang Kai's back, then effortlessly jumped onto Tang Yuxian’s Treading Cloud Steed.

"Hold on tight." Yang Kai reminded her, then drove the Treading Cloud Steed into a lightning-fast gallop.

Luo Xiaoman, at a loss, quickly grabbed Yang Kai’s clothes, her charming face turning pale.

The journey was silent.

Qiu Yimeng seemed very upset, refusing to speak to Yang Kai during their rest stops. Meanwhile, after a whole day of anxiety, Luo Xiaoman began to relax.

The distance was long, and amidst the bumpy ride, Yang Kai could occasionally feel two soft masses behind him, remarkably elastic, making him somewhat thankful for his decision.

This girl, Luo Xiaoman, indeed had ample assets!

If he had brought Qiu Yimeng, he probably wouldn't have had such enjoyment.

This discovery made the journey back to Zhongdu seem less dull.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian both sensed the strange atmosphere of the group and refrained from speaking, thereby the entire trip was relatively quiet, with only the howling wind rushing past their ears, and no one uttering a word.

As they traveled, it seemed the whole world already knew of the Yang Family’s call for its direct descendants, and the whispers of the battle for succession gradually spread.

The recent righteous and demonic battle had just occurred; now, the Yang Family was set to engage in the battle for succession, making this year a notably tumultuous time.

The battle for succession attracted countless eyes.

Although the Yang Family's struggle was merely a top clan selecting the next family head, it involved a wide array of influences, and its impact was unparalleled, drawing in nearly all prominent powers.

Those powers wanted their young members to participate, showcasing the flair and depth of the top family’s young masters, thus gaining experience and honing their skills.

On the other hand, they also sought to establish connections with the eight great families of Zhongdu through this opportunity.

If one made the right connections, they would naturally reap various benefits in the future.

Aside from those major powers, there were many solitary martial artists who intended to head to Zhongdu in search of opportunities for recognition.

This was a rare chance, and it was also a highly anticipated event. Through this opportunity, some would leap to fame, while others would face annihilation, losing their entire clan.

With both benefits and drawbacks manifesting, the battle for succession became a gamble—betting lives and futures.

And this war revolved entirely around the young masters of the Yang Family's generation.

...

Five days later.

The group had traveled thousands of miles, yet still had some distance to Zhongdu.

The three Treading Cloud Steeds came to a stop. Qiu Yimeng gazed into the distance and said, "That’s the territory of the Lü Family; I need to go over and borrow two Treading Cloud Steeds."

Turning her head to look at Yang Kai, she asked, "Do you want to come over to rest for a while?"

Yang Kai frowned, about to refuse when Tang Yuxian interjected, "Since we’re here, we might as well pay a visit; it won’t take too long."

Yang Kai cast a suspicious glance at her, unsure why she had made the decision for him.

Tang Yuxian chuckled, "It seems the Lü Family has some ties with the Qiu Family, right?"

Qiu Yimeng nodded. "Yeah, they are considered distantly related. But among the eight great families in Zhongdu, which has no ties with outside powers? If we count them all, the whole world is interconnected. It’s just that the Lü Family has maintained close relations with the Qiu Family and has frequently interacted over the years."

Tang Yuxian remarked, "The Lü Family is also regarded as a first-rate family, and it wouldn’t disgrace your status to pay them a visit."

Her words carried an implication that Yang Kai instantly understood; Tang Yuxian wanted him to take the opportunity to form a connection with the Lü Family, trying to see if he could gain them as support for the upcoming battle for succession.

Even if he couldn’t forge a strong alliance, it wouldn’t hurt to be recognized.

Now, although Yang Kai held the title of a young master of the Yang Family, he truly lacked any real standing. A young master without substantial backing, no matter how powerful, was merely a paper tiger.

Realizing her intentions, Yang Kai found it difficult to refuse, nodding, "Alright, this is their territory after all; it would be impolite not to pay a visit."

Qiu Yimeng snorted lightly, disdainful of Yang Kai for being two-faced, reaping benefits while acting coy.

The Lü Family could not truly be counted among the first-rate families, but for the past few decades, they had been close with the Qiu Family. After receiving support and guidance from the Qiu Family, their influence gradually grew stronger, even producing a master at the Above Divine Roaming level, allowing them to ascend the ranks.

However, this was a recent development.

If we consider it truly, the Lü Family was not that powerful among the first-rate factions.

Since being elevated to a first-rate family, the nearby second and third-rate powers naturally had to bow their heads to them, and thus the Lü Family rose to prominence.

Lü Liang was the head of the Lü Family. Although his strength was not at the top echelon, only reaching the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, as the family head, his power wasn’t the main concern—it was his social connections and leadership abilities that caused the Lü Family to prosper.

It was precisely because of his willingness to visit over the years and maintain regular contact with the Qiu Family that he was able to latch onto this formidable tree for support.

When the group arrived, several guards immediately recognized their distinguished identities and hurried forward to greet them respectfully.

As the guards watched over the gate of the Lü Family, they naturally had sharp eyes; a Treading Cloud Steed was a demonic beast that only first-rate families could nurture, evidencing the status of Yang Kai and his group.

Qiu Yimeng revealed her identity and name, and they were promptly welcomed inside. Others rushed ahead, likely to inform the higher-ups of the Lü Family.

This was a courtyard filled with elegant pavilions. The estate was replete with winding streams, gazebos, and various flowers and plants, creating a refreshing atmosphere.

The pavilions, though not very tall, were exquisite and exuded a poetic charm.

Qiu Yimeng walked at the forefront, with Luo Xiaoman by her side, while Yang Kai followed behind, and the two Blood Servants brought up the rear.

As they walked and looked around, Yang Kai found himself rather intrigued by this estate.
