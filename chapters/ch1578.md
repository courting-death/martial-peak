## Chapter 1578 — A Troublesome Task

Shan Qingluo and Yu Xiong stood outside the bedchamber for well over an hour before the screams inside gradually subsided.

Even Yu Xiong, a yao whose nerves were usually as thick as a wall, couldn't help feeling a chill crawl through him.

The bedchamber doors burst open with a thunderous crash, and a figure stumbled out, blood soaking his body, breath ragged and feeble as if death lingered at his heels.

Shan Qingluo's eyes narrowed slightly...

With a single glance she recognized the strength of the man — this must be Ba He, for a powerful aura of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm radiated from his body.

It seemed their foster mother had indeed been furious this time; whether she had forgiven Senior Ba He or not remained unknown.

"Senior, are you all right?" Yu Xiong stepped forward and helped Ba He up.

"Cough cough... it's nothing, I won't die just yet," Ba He waved weakly, seeming barely to have the strength to speak.

Yu Xiong opened his mouth, at a loss for what to say by way of comfort.

Ba He suddenly lifted his head and looked toward Shan Qingluo. Though the old man was well-traveled and had seen countless people in his life, the moment his eyes fell upon her, they couldn’t help but brighten. His previously withered aura even seemed to recover slightly.

Ba He inclined his head gently and said, "This must be Miss Shan, yes?"

"Qingluo greets Senior," Shan Qingluo bowed gracefully.

"Miss Shan, you're too polite. Well then, the yao finally has some decent talent," Ba He drew the corner of his mouth into a smile. "Back in my day I acted stubbornly and failed to live up to the Lady's expectations. I hope you won't let her down too."

"I will follow your teachings, Senior..." Shan Qingluo said softly, her expression complicated.

"Hm. Go on in; the Lady is waiting for you," Ba He waved them in. Forcing his weakened body forward, each step left a bloody print — a harrowing sight.

Shan Qingluo and Yu Xiong watched Ba He's retreating figure with a few involuntary sighs; once the rising star of the yao, the top expert below the Void King Realm, now punished by their foster mother to this state.

"Is that Qingluo? Come in," a voice called from within the bedchamber.

Shan Qingluo felt an inexplicable pang of guilt, bit her red lip, and steeled herself as she stepped inside.

"Uh, I'll head back first," Yu Xiong muttered to himself, then turned on his heel and tried to flee.

"Yu Xiong, get your ass in here!" Chi Yue's clear command rang out.

Yu Xiong's scalp prickled; his lifted foot dropped at once and he turned around with the look of a man who'd lost both parents, sulking unwillingly as he followed Shan Qingluo.

He'd should have left ages ago... Yu Xiong's regret ate at him.

The spacious, bright bedchamber held a beautiful woman standing motionless, her face as calm as still water.

Her figure was voluptuous, the chest proud, the waist slender and graceful. No energy fluctuations issued from her; she appeared as an ordinary person who had never cultivated.

She was breathtakingly beautiful — lips like the most vivid rubies, skin fairer than frost or snow, fingers long and pale.

In terms of allure toward men, she was in no way inferior to Shan Qingluo. She merely lacked that innate, seductive charm Shan Qingluo possessed, yet the noble aura emanating from her graceful figure surpassed Shan Qingluo’s by countless folds.

It was hard to imagine that this beauty was one of the ten principal lords of the yao star and the foster mother of Shan Qingluo and Yu Xiong — Lady Chi Yue!

After the siblings entered they first paid their respects to Lady Chi Yue, and after receiving her response they carefully sat to one side.

"Has the alchemical master from Huiyue City been arranged?" Chi Yue asked casually.

"Reporting to foster mother, arrangements have been made. Does foster mother wish to see her?" Shan Qingluo looked toward Chi Yue.

"No need to rush. If this person can refine an Origin-Grade pill that produces a Pill Cloud, she is indeed extraordinary; but I am more interested in the human man who came with her. Qingluo, do you have anything to tell me? I've heard some startling rumors," Chi Yue seated herself and looked at Shan Qingluo with bright eyes.

Shan Qingluo's body trembled; she rose at once, knelt and bit her teeth. "Foster mother, pardon me, that man..."

"Why so nervous? Your foster mother won't eat him — rise and speak," Chi Yue waved and helped Shan Qingluo to her feet.

Seeing Chi Yue showing no sign of anger, Shan Qingluo's nerves eased noticeably and her flustered heart slowly calmed.

"Tell me — are the rumors I heard true?" Chi Yue asked further.

"They are true," Shan Qingluo answered through clenched teeth.

"Oh? So that human is truly the one who captured your heart?" Chi Yue smiled lightly.

"Yes."

"Is he remarkable? Why would a woman like you fall for him? Yu Xiong says he's just a pretty face who lives off women."

"No, Yu Xiong talks nonsense," Shan Qingluo glared viciously at Yu Xiong, who shrank his head and scratched his chin while staring up at the sky...

"Tell me, what is it about him that has you so smitten?" Chi Yue took an interest and pressed for details.

"I can't put it into words..." Shan Qingluo smiled shyly. Before a powerful existence like Lady Chi Yue her queenly air was fully suppressed. "We met when he was weak — I was at the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, while he was only at the True Yuan Realm."

"That's quite a gap," Chi Yue arched her brows. "But now he seems to have reached the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; so his cultivation speed has kept pace with yours?"

Realizing this, she revealed a trace of astonishment.

She had watched Shan Qingluo's ascent and was somewhat shocked to find that this human was in no way inferior to her foster daughter.

"Hm. I don't know where he's been these years or what he's done. The last time was an incidental meeting in the Imperial Garden; this time he has come to Di Chen specifically to seek me."

"He went to the Imperial Garden too?" Chi Yue's interest deepened.

"Yes. At that time he and I teamed up to fight a group from the Hengluo Commerce Guild in the Imperial Garden, but we didn't have time to speak much before the Imperial Garden was closed."

"Hmph, the Hengluo Commerce Guild!" Chi Yue snorted, a hint of disdain on her pretty face. "Since you fought alongside him, tell me — what is his strength like?"

"This..." Shan Qingluo's expression turned troubled.

"You don't know that either?" Chi Yue's face darkened.

"Forgive me, foster mother. The battle was brief and I couldn't observe him carefully; only that I can be sure he is not weak."

Chi Yue laughed softly and said slowly, "If you are so certain, then I might give him a chance. Though his courage to come to Di Chen for you is admirable, he is after all only human, and it seems he has other women! Chi Yue's daughter will not share a man with another woman. Keep your feelings in check; I will test him. If he proves himself to have the qualities I can accept, I will not oppose your relationship. But if he is all show and rotten inside, I will personally see to his extermination!"

After speaking, Chi Yue looked at Shan Qingluo, expecting panic and tearful pleading, but to her surprise she saw joy on Shan Qingluo's face.

"You have such confidence in him?" Chi Yue was astonished.

“Though it’s been decades since I last saw him, even back then he was someone who could create miracles. I believe he won’t disappoint me—or you, foster mother,” Shan Qingluo said solemnly.

"Very well, if you say so, I am at ease." Chi Yue nodded, pleased by Shan Qingluo's attitude, and called, "Yu Xiong!"

"Here!" Yu Xiong sprang up at once.

“I’ll leave this to you — probe that little bastard’s depth for me. If he’s nothing but an ordinary human, kill him quickly so he won’t be an eyesore.” Chi Yue waved her hand.

"Yes!" Yu Xiong's eyes flashed with ferocity as he replied in a low voice.

"You may go now."

The siblings left Lady Chi Yue's bedchamber. Yu Xiong looked exhilarated, cracking his knuckles as if ready to go all out.

Although he thought Yang Kai was an amusing fellow for daring to call himself his brother-in-law, in the end he was only human; for a human to covet his Little Sister while there were other women involved was like a toad wanting to swallow a swan.

Now that he had Chi Yue's orders, he would of course evaluate Yang Kai properly. First he planned to beat the man senseless and then see about everything else.

"Yu Xiong!" Shan Qingluo called.

"What is it?" Yu Xiong looked up at once.

Cold light flashed in Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes as she glanced sideways at him. Her red lips parted and she said, "If you dare to personally lay a hand on him, I'll make you regret it!"

"Uh..." Yu Xiong was stunned, his face long as he wailed, "Little Sister, Eldest Brother is just carrying out Lady's orders, it's Lady's instruction!"

"I don't care — you cannot personally strike him. If you do, you'll never have me as your Little Sister again." With that she left without giving Yu Xiong a chance to speak.

“Little Sister! Little Ancestor! Have mercy…!” Yu Xiong called after her, but no matter how hoarsely he shouted, she gave no response.

He suddenly thought this was a most awkward and troublesome errand.

......

After staying in the palace for three days, Lady Chi Yue finally summoned Xia Ningshang. As an Alchemy Grandmaster capable of refining pills that produced a Pill Cloud, Xia Ningshang fully possessed such qualifications.

As for Yang Kai, Chi Yue paid him no mind and had no intention of receiving him.

Chi Yue's impression of Xia Ningshang was very good: the human woman was gentle and kind, her eyes clear and pure. Not only was her cultivation respectable, but her depth of understanding in alchemy was truly profound.

When summoning Xia Ningshang, Chi Yue had deliberately arranged for several renowned alchemists of the palace to accompany her and examine Xia Ningshang's skill.

The result left her very satisfied. In her insights on alchemy, Xia Ningshang already carried the bearing of a grandmaster, rivaling those old men with white hair who had devoted their lives to refinement.

In the alchemical trial held on the spot, Xia Ningshang won by an absolute margin!

Overjoyed at obtaining such a talent, Chi Yue immediately offered extremely generous conditions to have Xia Ningshang reside in the palace and refine pills for her.

Were Xia Ningshang not so inexperienced and young, the palace's position as chief alchemist would almost certainly have changed hands.
