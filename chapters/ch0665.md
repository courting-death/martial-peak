## Chapter 665 — Wind-and-Thunder Wings

Yang Kai's Demon God Transformation and the Demon God Transformation of the Ancient Demon Clan's members looked similar at first glance, but Li Rong still perceived differences between them.

An ordinary clansman's Demon God Transformation could not cover such a wide area; even someone as powerful as Li Rong, when manifesting the Demon God Transformation, would only have demon marks on her abdomen, chest, throat and face. Yet this human's back was already bristling with Demon Marks, and judging by the state around his waist, his lower body must be marked as well.

His Demon Marks had already spread out completely!

It was the most authentic Demon God Transformation.

This realization filled Li Rong with envy.

Inside the barrier, Yang Kai carefully felt the changes before and behind his body, searching for traces of the Demon Marks within him, immersing his mind to control the Demon Marks and attempting to draw them into his flesh and blood.

Once he successfully branded the Demon Marks into his flesh and merged them into his bloodline, he would be able to reach the Second-Tier Stage, and his strength would increase further.

It was a painfully arduous task; Yang Kai's expression was meticulous and wholly focused.

Time passed.

More than ten days later, a dazzling figure appeared in the subterranean chamber; Li Rong, who had been watching Yang Kai's progress here, turned and saw that Han Fei had also arrived.

Li Rong gave a slight nod and then returned her attention to Yang Kai.

"Why did he take his clothes off?" Han Fei glanced at Yang Kai in the barrier, her face flushing as she muttered in displeasure.

"Makes it easier to observe the progress of the Demon Marks, hehe." Li Rong smiled. "What are you afraid of? We don't know how much younger he is; even if he stripped naked it wouldn't matter."

Han Fei looked a little embarrassed and asked softly, "How's the progress?"

"It's fine." Li Rong nodded with satisfaction. "At least he can draw part of the Demon Marks into his flesh. In another month or so he'll roughly reach the Second-Tier Stage."

"That fast?" Han Fei felt deeply astonished.

"See, the Great Demon God's judgment isn't poor. If his aptitude were dull, why would the Great Demon God entrust him with the World-Ending Demon Eye?"

"I underestimated him." Han Fei nodded with gravity. "Before I only thought he had some good luck."

"Now it's time to reconsider him; in the future our clan will probably serve under him." Li Rong chuckled, then suddenly glanced curiously at the jade box in Han Fei's hand. "What did you bring?"

Han Fei said, "Something I promised to give him a few days ago."

Saying this, Han Fei reached out, opened the jade box, and quickly shut it again.

Li Rong couldn't help but cover her mouth in surprise. "Isn't that the Wind-and-Thunder Wings? Why are you giving this to him?"

"He might be able to refine it." Han Fei smiled faintly.

"Why say that? Even we couldn't refine it." Li Rong asked curiously.

The Wind-and-Thunder Wings were a pair of peculiar wings imbued with the Laws of the Heavenly Dao; no one knew which ancestor of the Ancient Demon Clan had acquired them or what their origin was. Through many twists and turns they had ended up in Han Fei's hands.

Over the years, Han Fei had repeatedly attempted to refine the Wind-and-Thunder Wings, but every attempt had ended in failure.

This pair of Wind-and-Thunder Wings was of tremendous value, one of the Ancient Demon Clan's few true treasures.

Li Rong had tried to refine them years ago and suffered the same fate as Han Fei: the wings rejected them and she had to give up.

It was unexpected that Han Fei would bring this item now to give to Yang Kai.

"We couldn't refine it, but he might, because he also has a pair of wings that contain the Laws of the Heavenly Dao."

"He has wings too?" Li Rong was stunned.

"Yes." Han Fei nodded lightly and then recounted what had happened under the volcano.

Li Rong's beautiful eyes gleamed as she listened; after pondering for a long moment she said, "If that's the case, he truly might be able to refine it. But are you willing to give it? You don't seem that optimistic about him."

Han Fei smiled faintly. "It's just sitting there anyway. If he can't refine it, it's simply because he's lacking the ability; if he can, it's a way to thank him for saving my life. Besides, because of him our clan obtained so many Crystal Stones — compared to the clan's development, this pair of sealed Wind-and-Thunder Wings is inconsequential."

"True." Li Rong nodded slightly. "Let's wait until he comes out. From what I can see, he won't stop until he reaches the Second-Tier Stage."

Han Fei smiled softly and said no more; she and Li Rong stood at a distance and quietly waited.

One mature and voluptuous, the other cold as ice; the two beautiful women standing together made an attractive sight.

Yang Kai, however, had no awareness of this; his entire spirit was submerged in the Demon Marks, exerting every effort to control them, his flesh quivering as he branded the Demon Marks into himself.

It was absolutely true that cultivation pays no heed to time.

Yang Kai focused only on the progress of his Demon God Transformation and had no idea how much time had passed.

Progress was being made bit by bit; though slow, Yang Kai was quite pleased.

He could finally effectively control the Demon Marks.

A month passed in the blink of an eye; Li Rong and Han Fei, waiting outside the barrier, showed no impatience and were instead dumbfounded by Yang Kai's various performances.

While the Demon God Transformation could dramatically boost an Ancient Demon Clan member's strength, it also placed a tremendous load on the body.

Only the Ancient Demon Clan's rugged physiques could endure it.

Ordinary clansmen, after manifesting the Demon God Transformation, could only sustain it for a single hour before reaching their limit.

Even someone as powerful as Li Rong could not maintain it indefinitely.

But Yang Kai had managed it. Since he first manifested the Demon God Transformation one and a half months ago, he had never dispelled the Demon Marks. The robustness of his body seemed to transcend any race; even the Ancient Demon Clan could not compare.

"What a freak!" Han Fei slowly shook her head.

Suddenly a hum sounded within the barrier; the final Demon Mark covering Yang Kai disappeared, and his aura and the power of his Qi and blood did not fall but instead rose by another tier.

Li Rong's eyes lit up and she cried, "He succeeded!"

After an uninterrupted month and a half of cultivation, Yang Kai had finally pushed his Demon God Transformation to the Second-Tier Stage — the Demon Marks were branded into his flesh!

Saying this, Li Rong waved her hand and dissipated the Silent-Sealing Stone's barrier.

Violent pressure surged in from all sides; Li Rong and Han Fei involuntarily braced themselves against it.

Yet this pressure, though fierce now, could no longer suppress the Ancient Demon Clan's power — unless Yang Kai revealed his Demon Marks again.

In other words, at any time he possessed a bargaining chip for restraining the Ancient Demon Clan.

Sensing the barrier's disappearance, Yang Kai turned his head and looked toward the distance; seeing Li Rong and Han Fei, he grinned at them, his figure flickering as he instantly arrived before them.

"How do you feel?" Li Rong asked gently, forcing down her own discomfort.

"Good — just a little hard to control." Yang Kai nodded slightly; as he spoke, the Demon Marks showed and faded across his exposed skin.

"You've done well to get this far in such a short time; you'll become more familiar with it as you progress." Li Rong smiled faintly. "Hold out your hand."

Yang Kai frowned; not knowing what she intended, he nonetheless extended one hand toward her.

Li Rong's hand was quick; with a blade she sliced across his palm and a long cut opened.

Blood poured forth.

Having not sensed any malice from her, Yang Kai had not dodged and only looked at her with puzzlement.

"Take a careful look at your blood—isn't it different from before?"

At her words Yang Kai looked down, and his expression changed.

He discovered that within his fresh blood there were traces of golden light — the gold like the pupil of the World-Ending Demon Eye. These golden glints were subtle and easy to miss if not observed closely, yet within them lay tremendous power.

"Demon God Golden Blood?" Han Fei's eyes brightened as she exclaimed.

“Correct, it is Demon God Golden Blood!” Li Rong nodded gravely. “This is the most distinct sign of advancing to the second stage of the Demon God Transformation. According to the ancient records, only the Great Demon God himself could possess golden blood — the noblest of bloodlines.”

Saying this, Li Rong also cut her palm.

Yang Kai looked closely and found that faint golden radiance also ran through her blood; her gold was not as brilliant as his, but it was clearly more abundant.

"This is proof that my Ancient Demon Clan carries Demon God blood!" Li Rong wore an expression of pride.

Yang Kai's expression grew strange. "Are you saying that I'm one of your Ancient Demon Clan members now?"

"You could say that. Although your origin is human, because of the Great Demon God your bloodline has been altered."

"So am I human or demon from now on?"

"That's up to you how you see it; being human or demon isn't important." Li Rong smiled softly. "As you continue to cultivate, your Demon God Golden Blood will increase. When your blood becomes entirely golden, it means you have fully comprehended the Demon God Transformation's Second-Tier Stage. At the Third-Tier Stage even your bones will turn golden."

Yang Kai frowned but said nothing.

Because of the Indomitable Golden Body, his bones were already golden.

"Enough; you've cultivated long enough. Maintaining the Demon God Transformation for such durations places too great a burden on your body — cultivation must be balanced with rest." Li Rong spoke earnestly, concern on her face.

Yang Kai nodded lightly; he also felt fatigued, his body aching as it never had before, and when he dispelled the Demon God Transformation he suddenly felt much lighter.

"Commander Han Fei has something fine to give you." Li Rong said with a smile.

"What is it?" Yang Kai looked at Han Fei.

Han Fei stepped forward and handed him the jade box. "Look for yourself. It might help you, or you might not be fated to receive it — don't expect too much."

Her words were vague, which only piqued Yang Kai's curiosity. He took the jade box and opened it; his eyes brightened.

Inside the box lay a pair of palm-sized wings; they were transparent, the material unidentifiable and not like a Secret Treasure, yet occasionally a dazzling flash would ripple across them. From that pair Yang Kai sensed the forces of wind and thunder.
