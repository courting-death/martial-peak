## Chapter 1864 — Void Mind Crystal

In Room A-1, Jiang Changfeng wore an expression of helplessness; he knew Gongsun Liang had dumped this mess on him to clean up, and he cursed inwardly.

On the stage, Li Nuo waited a moment and, seeing that Gongsun Liang still showed no intention of raising the price, she began to count down with pleasure; after the third count, the unknown refining material belonged to Yang Kai.

Immediately someone sent the material to Room A-5, and Yang Kai put it directly into his Spatial Ring, a bright smile gracing his features.

Hua Youmeng watched with intense curiosity; she had no idea what the material was that made Yang Kai so happy.

The auction came to an end and the martial artists who had attended left one after another; when most had gone, Jiang Changfeng finally mustered the nerve to go find Li Nuo and retrieve the Saint Crystals that Gongsun Liang had previously pawned with her.

That was one billion Saint Crystals — naturally he could not just leave them.

In Room A-2, Zi Wuji paced impatiently, glancing up toward the door from time to time as if waiting for something.

After a long while the door opened wide and Ji Jun appeared.

Zi Wuji's expression changed and he hurriedly asked, Elder Ji, how did it go?”

Ji Jun grinned and cupped his fist, “I did not fail the Second Young Master's orders; both matters are done.”

“Really?” Zi Wuji was overjoyed. “Excellent! Once the matter is accomplished, Elder Ji, your merit will be counted first!”

Saying so, he produced a jade bottle and continued, “Second Young Master, please take a look. This is the Void King Pill I have just purchased from Miss Li Nuo. According to her, you stepped in today to right an injustice, and she holds great admiration for you. So this pill is being counted at the price you bid earlier—only six hundred million Saint Crystals.”

“Oh?” Zi Wuji's eyes flashed with surprise. “Li Nuo actually has such boldness?”

Ji Jun also looked puzzled. “There is no honest merchant; Li Nuo is a businesswoman, yet she voluntarily gave up four hundred million Saint Crystals — I think there must be a reason... perhaps she knows that Lord.”

Zi Wuji pondered, “So Elder Ji means she gave us this large discount because I secretly helped that Lord?”

“I can think of no other reason.” Ji Jun nodded seriously.

“True.” Zi Wuji thought for a moment and agreed with Ji Jun's inference. “If that's the case, we should treat the Tongtian Auction House well. But never mind that — what about the other thing I asked you to arrange?”

“That Lord agreed. I had Miss Li Nuo arrange a secret chamber for the Second Young Master and his companion; come with me.”

Zi Wuji's eyes lit up and he hurriedly followed Ji Jun out.

In the rear courtyard of the Tongtian Auction House, within a secret chamber whose seals had been lifted, Li Nuo and Hua Youmeng stood outside waiting; before long Zi Wuji and Ji Jun arrived.

The two women bowed quickly. Li Nuo smiled, “That Lord is inside; Second Young Master, please.”

“Many thanks to Miss Li Nuo this time.” Zi Wuji politely cupped his fist.

“Second Young Master is too modest; it was a small favor.”

“No matter what, I will remember this deed today. When the opportunity comes, I will repay it!”

Li Nuo's smile brightened, and she said nothing more.

Only then did Zi Wuji and Ji Jun push open the door and enter.

Inside, Yang Kai sat alone on a chair, his eyes tightly closed, as if contemplating something.

Seeing this, Zi Wuji immediately held his breath and signaled Ji Jun to step out.

Ji Jun frowned and murmured, “Second Young Master...”

“Elder Ji, I understand.” Zi Wuji looked at him earnestly.

Ji Jun had no choice but to retreat.

The room was left with only Yang Kai and Zi Wuji; Yang Kai remained motionless, eyes unopened and silent, and Zi Wuji dared not disturb him rashly, so he stood quietly and waited.

He mistakenly thought Yang Kai was pondering something; in truth Yang Kai's soul had already slipped into the Small Xuan Realm.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm there was no one else — only Yang Kai's enormous Incarnation, and his two aids: the Fire Bird Liu Yan and the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao.

The Incarnation had been refined from the entire Floating Continent and was truly huge; it could not fit inside a Spatial Ring, only an Imperial Treasure space like the Small Xuan Realm could contain it.

Since bringing the Incarnation in last time, Yang Kai had not paid much attention to it; now that he looked it over, he found with surprise that the Incarnation had shrunk considerably.

He could not help feeling pleased; it seemed that as time passed the Incarnation slowly refined away impurities within itself, becoming smaller in size while growing stronger.

The principle was similar to refining a tool; the Stone Puppet clan's innate divine abilities allowed the Incarnation to accomplish this, and in time it would continue to shrink.

Of course it could never return to the form of a Stone Puppet; Yang Kai only hoped the Incarnation's volume could shrink by half. Its current enormity offered great pressure to enemies, but the size made movement inconvenient — a double-edged sword.

The Fire Bird Liu Yan was still devouring and refining the Sun's True Fire; each strand of Sun's True Fire she absorbed required a long time to refine, and each strand refined increased her strength greatly.

Xiaoxiao was now doing something similar.

They were Yang Kai's two great aids, and he naturally would not favor one over the other. Since Liu Yan was refining the Sun's True Fire, Xiaoxiao could not be left behind.

But what Xiaoxiao did was somewhat different: while Liu Yan absorbed Sun's True Fire and merged it into herself to gain strength, Xiaoxiao directly consumed the Sun's True Essence.

This method was more domineering and dangerous than the Fire Bird's, but it yielded faster growth.

When Yang Kai arrived, both aids were diligently cultivating, and despite many years of depletion the chunk of Sun's True Essence still showed no change — it was as terrifyingly scorching as when Yang Kai first obtained it.

No wonder it had been refined from a star and become a supreme treasure; the energy contained within was incalculable.

Yang Kai tossed the material he had just won into the Small Xuan Realm and willed Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan to come.

In the next moment Liu Yan took human form and appeared before Yang Kai, expressionless as she spoke, “Greetings, Master. What are your orders?”

“You two, strip and refine the outer layer of this thing,” Yang Kai said, pointing at the material he had paid two Void King Pills for.

Liu Yan focused and stared at the mineral the size of an infant's head, astonishment quickly crossing her face. “Master, what is this? Why do I feel it will greatly aid me?”

“The outer layer is surely Fenggang Silver,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

Earlier at the auction some martial artist had said it resembled Fenggang Silver — they were not wrong. Fenggang Silver was formed from the breath of an Ancient Divine Spirit True Phoenix's exhalation, condensed into ore; it contained the aura of an Ancient Divine Spirit and was extremely precious.

Liu Yan's true form was an Artifact Spirit in the shape of a Fire Bird. Among the world's birds the most noble was naturally the Sacred Spirit True Phoenix.

She could sense that Fenggang Silver would greatly aid her, which was part of the reason; if she could consume and refine Fenggang Silver she might catch a glimpse of the True Phoenix's bearing.

“The outer layer?” Liu Yan looked thoughtful. “So there is another layer inside?”

“Indeed. Do not recklessly meddle with the inner layer — it is of great use to me!” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Master, what is inside?”

“A Void Mind Crystal!” Yang Kai's eyelids narrowed as he spoke the words.

“A Void Mind Crystal?” Liu Yan exclaimed in alarm. “One that only a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert can condense within themselves?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded heavily. Although he was now of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, he had only just advanced and was still exploring such existences; there were no signs within his body of a Void Mind Crystal forming.

But he had once come into contact with a genuine Void Mind Crystal!

It had been the Void Mind Crystal of Yao King Feng E taken from the Blood Prison Trial at the request of Lady Chi Yue of Di Chen Star.

However, that was a yao's Void Mind Crystal, so in form it appeared as an Inner Core; the one hidden within this Fenggang Silver was a human Void Mind Crystal.

That was precisely why he had been willing to spend heavily to compete with Gongsun Liang!

He was sure that even if Gongsun Liang did not know exactly what lay inside, Gongsun must have sensed its uncommon value, hence his continuous bids.

In that auction only he and Gongsun Liang had reached the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, and only their Divine Senses could penetrate the outer layer of Fenggang Silver to catch a glimpse of the faint reality within. Others lacked this ability and could not judge the true worth of the ore.

The difference was that Yang Kai could be certain, while Gongsun Liang was vague.

If Gongsun Liang had been able to confirm it as well, he would never have given up so easily; he would likely have fought Yang Kai to the death.

A Void Mind Crystal offered unimaginable advancement and aid to Void King Realm cultivators; when Lady Chi Yue had Yang Kai retrieve Yao King Feng E's Void Mind Crystal from the Blood Prison, it was to prepare for her own push to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Now Yang Kai's realm was on par with Lady Chi Yue's at that time, so of course he needed a Void Mind Crystal as well.

How many Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts were there in the entire Star Domain? They were ancient monsters who never died of old age; even at their end no one knew where they perished, let alone obtained their Void Mind Crystals.

Therefore those things were treasures money simply could not buy.

Yang Kai's luck had allowed him to obtain a Void Mind Crystal this time, and compared to the inner Void Mind Crystal the Fenggang Silver was worth almost nothing; he generously allowed Liu Yan and Xiaoxiao to both consume and refine it. The Fenggang Silver itself would greatly strengthen Xiaoxiao, and the True Phoenix's aura within the ore was priceless to Liu Yan; with the Sun's True Essence combined, the two aids would surely leap forward in power.

As for why the Void Mind Crystal was wrapped within Fenggang Silver, Yang Kai did not know.

Perhaps in some ancient age a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert had been incinerated by a True Phoenix's divine flame; the Void Mind Crystal in his body fused with nearby ore — it was a plausible guess.

It was only speculation, but likely not far from the truth.

It was precisely because of the Void Mind Crystal's presence that the Fenggang Silver's color appeared so different.
