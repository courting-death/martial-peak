## Chapter 6 – A fine horse needs a worthy saddle, beauty is bestowed upon heroes

Yang Kai lay quietly on the ground for over an hour before finally standing up; the earlier ordeal had drained all his strength.

Recalling the events of the past hour, Yang Kai felt as if he were in a dream, hardly believing it was real.

He pinched himself softly, feeling a slight sting.

“What on earth is that Black Book?” he muttered, unable to make sense of it all.

Once he calmed his mind, Yang Kai immediately noticed that something about himself had changed. Previously, he had scarce meals and suffered a brutal beating every five days, leaving his body perpetually weak. Yet now, he clearly felt a vibrant life force coursing within his bones. A warm energy radiated outward gently, bringing an indescribable sense of comfort.

As he moved slightly, his bones emitted a crisp, clear crackling sound, like an exquisite melody. The pain on his body had vanished, and the wounds inflicted by Zhou Dingjun today seemed to have healed.

Realizing this, Yang Kai hurriedly rolled up his sleeves and lifted his clothes for a thorough inspection. The bruises and contusions, once mottled with deep purples and blues, had entirely disappeared. Even his old, longstanding wounds showed signs of recovery.

He was still thin and emaciated, though!

He rubbed the areas where the wounds had been, and dead skin flakes fell away, revealing fresh, tender skin underneath. It was not as soft as a newborn’s, but certainly much healthier than before.

“Hiss…” Yang Kai gasped inwardly, utterly unprepared for the Golden Body’s remarkable restorative power that had fused with him.

Testing his strength once more, Yang Kai found his cultivation remained at the Third Stage of Body Tempering, unchanged. This discovery slightly dampened his spirits.

Since childhood, Yang Kai had often heard and read stories of the martial world, tales of seniors’ secrets and rare fortunes. He knew that many with profound blessings occasionally stumbled upon extraordinary opportunities and, like a fish leaping over the dragon gate, achieved unmatched fame.

But those were just stories. How many in the entire world truly changed their mundane lives by such luck? The most powerful elders would never wish for their cultivation to die with them; on their deathbeds, they sought disciples to pass their legacy. So the idea of casually finding a mystical chance by just jumping off a cliff or entering a cave was nearly impossible.

Yet this very thing had happened to him. That mysterious Black Book must have an ancient origin, and the Indomitable Golden Body was no idle boast but something extraordinary.

This could be called a rare opportunity, but also the natural outcome of his own efforts.

The last four lines on the first page of the Black Book read plainly: "Indomitable Golden Body, the sovereign’s pillar, only the soul of unyielding resolve may summon it!"

Had the Black Book fallen into anyone else’s hands, no one would have fathomed its secrets—it would have been discarded as useless trash. Because he picked it up and had rested his head on it for a year, sensing the indomitable and resilient spirit within his body, the Black Book’s mysteries finally manifested today.

In other words, this encounter was indeed his fortunate chance, but one obtained through his own determination. This realization brought Yang Kai a rush of comfort. As the saying goes, “A fine horse needs a worthy saddle; beauty is bestowed upon heroes…”

“Where is the Black Book?” Yang Kai suddenly remembered the treasure he had used as a pillow for a year and hastily began to search, but no matter how he looked, it was nowhere to be found.

Just as he grew anxious, a faint movement stirred within his body, and in the next instant, the Black Book abruptly appeared before his eyes, dropping to the ground with a sharp thud.

Yang Kai froze in astonishment, reached out to pick it up, then furrowed his brow thoughtfully for a moment. With a thought, the Black Book vanished seamlessly from his hand. Another thought, and it reappeared.

The scene resembled a magician’s illusion, but Yang Kai’s expression was grave because he genuinely felt that the Black Book could be absorbed into his body by his will alone.

“Could this Wordless Black Book be made of Soul-Calming Stone?” Yang Kai said aloud, nearly startling himself.

Soul-Calming Stone! That was a legendary heaven-defying treasure.

Only formed in places where billions of spirits gathered, in sunless abyssal depths teeming with Yin energy, drawing upon countless life essences, could such an extraordinary stone take shape.

An ancient verse spoke of such a thing:

"A palm’s breadth of black stone,  
Laying waste to myriad li;  
No life may draw near,  
No grass may grow."

Though these words were somewhat exaggerated—a Soul-Calming Stone of but a palm’s breadth could not truly desolate such vast lands—the process of its formation was indeed cruel and bloody. Any life that strayed too close would instantly perish.

Its formation took centuries, if not millennia, sometimes over ten thousand years.

The formation process aside, once a Soul-Calming Stone formed, it became a supreme treasure because it could be absorbed into a person’s body, with a special space carved out inside. This space, large or small, was perfect for storing items.

Though only a trial disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai’s knowledge was not poor. The legend of the Soul-Calming Stone had been passed down for years; everyone had heard of it.

When he first obtained the Black Book, Yang Kai hadn’t considered this possibility. But now, seeing it could be absorbed into his body, and recalling the Golden Body emerging from the book’s pages, he unmistakably recognized the Black Book’s material.

Yang Kai broke into a cold sweat on the spot.

Soul-Calming Stones only existed in legends, long vanished from the world. He had never imagined he would encounter even one, let alone such a large piece!

The ancient legend spoke only of a Soul-Calming Stone no larger than a palm’s breadth—already a treasure beyond price. Yet what lay before him had been forged into a book, a full chi in length and three fingers thick!

Its value was... incalculable!

If this news spread, not only Lingxiao Pavilion but the entire Great Han Dynasty might be devastated overnight by those coveting it.

Yang Kai’s hands grew burning hot with the horror of such a thing. Wiping his sweat, he was grateful the treasure could be held inside him—otherwise, the trouble would have been immense.

Bearing such a heaven-defying treasure, Yang Kai dared not be careless. Like a thief, he quickly shut the door to his room, hiding inside with his heart pounding wildly.

His excitement was difficult to contain but was also mixed with anxiety.

With his current weak strength, how could he possibly protect such a great treasure? Though the Wordless Black Book could be hidden inside him without risk of exposure, Yang Kai was not at ease.

Only through cultivation, through becoming stronger, could he truly safeguard his possession. Remembering the terrors of three years ago, his panicked eyes gradually calmed.

After all, he had crossed a thousand li and suffered hardships just to come to Lingxiao Pavilion—for cultivation.

Now that he possessed the Wordless Black Book, he might as well begin refining it. The Black Book’s first page granted him the Indomitable Golden Body. Though its true purpose was unknown, it must be good. And there were many more pages—surely not just a single Golden Body?
