## Chapter 6 – A fine horse needs a worthy saddle, beauty is bestowed on heroes

Yang Kai lay on the floor for more than an hour before he finally stood up; the earlier ordeal had drained every bit of strength from his body.

Thinking back on what had happened, he felt as though he had dreamed it all. He pinched himself—there was pain.

“What on earth is that Black Book?” he muttered, unable to unravel the mystery.

Once calm, he noticed something different. He had long been half-starved and beaten every five days; his frame was frail. Now he clearly sensed vigorous life inside his bones—a gentle warmth spreading outward, unspeakably comfortable.

He moved slightly. Crisp cracks echoed inside him, as though his skeleton played a heavenly melody. The bruises Zhou Dingjun left that morning no longer hurt.

Alarmed, Yang Kai rolled up his sleeves and lifted his shirt. The blue-black and purple welts were gone; even long-standing scars showed signs of healing—though he was still skin and bone.

He rubbed the places where wounds once lay; dead skin flaked away, revealing fresh flesh, healthier than before.

“Hss…” He drew a sharp breath. He had never imagined that the skeletal Golden Body could grant such powerful recovery.

Probing his strength, he found he was still Body Tempering Third Stage. That brought mild disappointment.

Since childhood he had heard countless tales—heroes blessed by fortune, soaring after chance encounters. Yet such stories were rare in truth; most sages ensured their legacies found worthy heirs. Stumbling on an inheritance by falling off a cliff or walking into a cave was nearly impossible.

Yet it had happened to him. The Black Book was surely extraordinary, and the Proud Bone Golden Body even more so.

The last four lines on the first page were plain: *Proud Bone Golden Body, a sovereign’s pillar; only an unyielding soul can command it.*

Had anyone else picked up the book, they would never have unlocked its secret. Only because he had slept on it a year, letting it feel his stubborn spirit, had the mystery revealed itself today.

So this was indeed a stroke of fortune—but a fortune won by his own qualities. The thought filled him with delight. “A fine horse needs a worthy saddle; beauty is bestowed on heroes…”

“Where’s the book?” He suddenly missed his year-long pillow. He searched the hut but could not find it.

While he worried, something stirred within. The next instant the Black Book flashed into sight and fell to the floor.

Stunned, he picked it up. After a moment’s thought it vanished from his hands, then reappeared when he willed it. It obeyed his intent, entering and leaving his body at will.

“This wordless Black Book… could it be a Soul-Calming Stone?” The words slipped out and startled him.

A Soul-Calming Stone! A legendary reverse treasure.

Only in abyssal pits where countless wraiths gathered, under endless Nine-Yin darkness, could such strange rock form—drawing power from innumerable lives.

An old verse spoke of it:

> A square inch of black stone  
> Lays waste to myriad miles;  
> No life may approach,  
> No grass may grow.

Exaggerated, perhaps—a mere inch of stone could not doom a kingdom—but the formation process was indeed blood-soaked. Any creature near the forming stone died instantly, and its creation took millennia.

Once formed, however, it was priceless. A Soul-Calming Stone could be stored inside one’s body and could open an inner space—large or small—perfect for storing items.

Though only a Trial Disciple, Yang Kai was not ignorant; stories of Soul-Calming Stones had circulated for ages. Earlier, he had not considered it, but seeing the book slip into his body and recalling the Golden Body rising from its pages, he could not mistake the material.

Cold sweat beaded on his forehead.

Such stones were thought extinct. Yet he had one—and not a square inch, but a whole foot-long tome three fingers thick!

Its value was beyond reckoning. If word spread, not only Lingxiao Pavilion but the entire Great Han Dynasty might be flattened overnight.

Hands hot and trembling, he wiped his brow. Thankfully the book could hide inside him.

Still, how could he, so weak, protect such treasure? It might remain concealed, yet anxiety gnawed at him.

Only by cultivating—only by growing strong—could he keep what was his. Remembering his journey three years ago, panic in his eyes slowly cooled into resolve.

He had crossed a thousand li, endured hardship, to enter Lingxiao Pavilion for cultivation.

Since the Wordless Black Book was his, he would start with it. The first page had given him the Proud Bone Golden Body; whatever its use, it could not be ordinary. And there were many more pages—surely more than one Golden Body?
