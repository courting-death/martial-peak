## Chapter 943 — Demon God's Secret Codex

In the main hall, Yang Kai smiled calmly while Demon Lord Changyuan's expression remained composed.

Xueli and Meng Ge, standing behind him, gaped with wide eyes and trembling bodies, utterly disbelieving.

The Demon Lord is actually going to personally apologize to this despicable human?

They could hardly believe their ears, staring at Changyuan in a daze; they wanted to confirm it, yet dared not speak.

Changyuan snorted lightly, displeased. "What? Are you two deaf or mute? Didn't you hear me? Do you want me to apologize for you myself?"

"We wouldn't dare!" Meng Ge and Xueli shuddered, sensing Changyuan's wrath. Without hesitation they clasped their fists, teeth gritted, and said in unison, "We have offended you recently—please forgive us, Saint Lord Yang!"

They wore the look of people who had been thoroughly humiliated; although forced by Changyuan to apologize to Yang Kai, anyone could see that given the chance they'd take revenge for this insult.

Changyuan's coercive pressure did not resolve the two sides' hatred; on the contrary, it deepened their hatred and fury toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, showing no reaction.

Changyuan laughed heartily, clearly delighted. "That's right—when you've done wrong you must apologize. Now, no more mutual hatred; I would like to be friends with Saint Lord Yang."

"I don't want to," Yang Kai said with a low chuckle.

Changyuan's face turned bitter. "You're not even going to give me this small courtesy? Saint Lord Yang, you're so cold-hearted."

The two traded barbs; though no blades flashed, everyone standing behind them held their breath, afraid a single misstep would spark a real fight.

Yet both men wore gentle, warm smiles, and the atmosphere seemed amiable.

Meng Ge and Xueli's hearts were in turmoil—an unpleasant, sour feeling.

The last time, Xueli had trespassed into human territory and been struck by Chu Lingxiao; she had hurried back to the Demon Domain and told no one about it.

A month and a half ago she and Meng Ge had encountered Yang Kai and engaged in a fierce battle before leaving in haste.

She wanted to keep it hidden, but Meng Ge was different—loyal to the Demon Lord. After returning to the Demon Domain he reported the incident, and Demon Lord Changyuan heard about it. He immediately set out from the Demon Capital and came here, saying he wished to see Saint Lord Yang.

With matters having reached this point, Xueli had no choice but to guide the way alongside Meng Ge.

They had expected the Demon Lord to step in to restore their face and avenge them; on the way they had fantasized about how they would make that human brat suffer if he fell into their hands, to soothe their hatred.

They had not expected the Demon Lord to adopt such an attitude upon meeting this human brat.

The two demon generals swallowed their bitterness like bitter herbs.

"Changyuan, cut the nonsense—tell me exactly what you want," Yang Kai said lightly, voicing the question on everyone's mind.

When dealing with such a powerful figure, playing coy would only leave him at a disadvantage; Yang Kai decided to be direct.

Changyuan sighed and, showing no intention to conceal anything, said, "It seems Saint Lord Yang guessed my purpose. I do have another motive. Yes, I came mainly to confirm one thing."

"Confirm what?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at him.

Changyuan smiled and said, "I want to know whether Saint Lord Yang is... a successor of the Great Demon God!"

The words stunned everyone into silence; Li Rong and Han Fei's eyes went cold and their auras surged as they glared at Changyuan.

Meng Ge and Xueli could not help but gape, horrified beyond belief.

The three words 'Great Demon God' struck every demon with unparalleled force.

"Saint Lord Yang need not deny it," Changyuan interrupted before Yang Kai could speak, raising a hand. "I only had suspicions, which is why I hurried here to confirm. After all, if you left and returned to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, even I wouldn't dare to trespass into human territory. Now it seems Saint Lord Yang truly is—yes, absolutely."

His tone left no doubt; Yang Kai only curled his lip. "Why are you so sure?"

"Because of these two ladies' loyalty!" Changyuan turned his gaze to Li Rong and Han Fei with a trace of envy. "I possess many treasured texts that record secret matters no one else knows. Among them is a record of the lineage that served the Great Demon God."

"They called themselves the Ancient Demon Clan, confidants of the Great Demon God who swore generations of loyalty. Unfortunately, before the Demon Lord's fall they vanished; people said they had been exterminated because they wielded too great a power. The Demon Lord feared that after his fall no one could restrain them, so he destroyed the clan."

"But I know the rumors are false. The Demon Lord sealed them away, intending to leave their power to his successor. These two ladies are from the Ancient Demon Clan; since they willingly serve you, Saint Lord Yang's identity becomes clear. The Ancient Demon Clan would not pledge loyalty to anyone else—even I would not be held in their regard."

Demon Lord Changyuan spoke at length; Yang Kai listened quietly without interjecting.

When he finished, Yang Kai merely inclined his head slightly. "It seems the Demon Lord knows secrets unknown to most."

His expression was resolute; even if Yang Kai wanted to deny it, it would be useless.

"Indeed," Changyuan nodded proudly. "I also know why the Demon Lord sealed the Ancient Demon Clan and why he intended to leave this power to his successor. The Great Demon God left traces of it all."

"Why?" Yang Kai couldn't help but ask, but the moment the question left his mouth he realized he'd been subtly led by Changyuan's words and had lost the initiative—a realization that made him inwardly seethe.

He forced a casual mask over his face, reminding himself the man before him was a wily old fox and he mustn't fall for any more tricks.

Changyuan chuckled, "For the coming cataclysm!"

"Cataclysm?" Yang Kai asked, astonished.

"Yes. As for what exactly the cataclysm is, I do not know, but Saint Lord Yang should be able to figure it out!" Changyuan said solemnly.

"If you don't even know, how could I?" Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly.

Changyuan's expression turned serious. "In my Demon Capital there is a secret chamber the Demon Lord left behind; its seals are numerous and fearsome. Generations of Demon Lords have longed to peek inside, but none have been able to break it."

"You can't break it either?"

Changyuan shook his head and looked wistful. "The Demon Lord's methods were peerless—beyond my reach. I always felt his cultivation surpassed the Saint Realm; perhaps he reached some higher plane."

Yang Kai's body trembled; he could not help sharing the same thought as Changyuan for a moment.

Earlier, when he and the two Great Yao Lords entered that strange space, he had witnessed the Great Demon God's methods and had entertained the same suspicion, though he couldn't fully accept it.

He hadn't expected Changyuan to think the same.

"I couldn't unlock it, but Saint Lord Yang might," Changyuan continued. "I don't know why you became the Great Demon God's successor, but if you are, you should possess the Demon God's Secret Codex, right?"

"The Demon God's Secret Codex?" Meng Ge and Xueli cried out together, fanaticism flashing across their faces.

Those four words seemed to make their blood boil.

"The Great Demon God once obtained a complete Soul-Calming Stone and used it to create the Demon God's Secret Codex. His various powers were hidden within it; whoever can open that Codex is his successor. If Saint Lord Yang truly is the successor, he should already have the Codex. That thing is the key to unlocking the Demon Capital's seals."

Yang Kai's expression turned odd. He waved his hand and a black book appeared in his palm. "Are you talking about this?"

All eyes fixed on the Wordless Black Book; greed filled Meng Ge and Xueli's gazes, and even Demon Lord Changyuan could not help being moved.

Guessing is one thing, seeing is another.

Changyuan's expression soon returned to normal; he inhaled and nodded. "Indeed, that is the Demon God's Secret Codex. It seems everything matches my guess—yet how unlucky that the Codex fell into a human's hands..."

He wore an open, unhidden look of regret.

Naturally, the Great Demon God's successor should have been among the demons, yet the Codex lay with Yang Kai.

They could not help feeling that fate had been unjust.

"Whether it's the Codex I can't say; I just call it the Wordless Black Book," Yang Kai said casually, then slipped the Wordless Black Book back into his body.

Meng Ge and Xueli were instantly crestfallen, their eyes sharpening as they stared at Yang Kai, eager to see where he had hidden the Codex.

Something made from such a large Soul-Calming Stone—regardless of any powers sealed within—would be priceless by material alone.

Anyone who saw it would covet it.

"Now that words are out in the open," Changyuan tried to steady his mood and looked at Yang Kai earnestly, "I came here with sincerity. By rights, merely being the Great Demon God's successor should be enough to command the Demon Domain. After all, the Demon Domain was created by the Demon Lord, and I believe that given enough time you could grow to the Great Demon God's level—a height even I can only yearn for."

At these words Meng Ge and Xueli swallowed and grew wary; sensing their hostile looks, Li Rong and Han Fei subtly gathered their power, ready to move.
