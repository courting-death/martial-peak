## Chapter 2321 — The Toothless Tiger

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said, "Everyone understands the reasoning, but very few can truly put it into practice."

Shi Cangying looked at him and said, "This old man thinks you're quite good. Since you can say such things, you must also be someone who understands reason. In that case, I'll be blunt..." As he spoke, his expression darkened and he waved his hand. "Thousand Leaves Sect does not welcome you. All of you, return to where you came from."

"Vice Sect Master Shi!" Ye Hen couldn't help but shout coldly, his face full of anger.

Yang Kai was someone Ye Qinghan had gone to great lengths to invite, to repair the Space Array. If he could really succeed, Thousand Leaves Sect would be able to rise again in a single stroke and never have to live in disgrace as before. This was a matter of utmost importance for the Sect's future. If not for this, he wouldn't have personally come out to greet Yang Kai and the others. But what he never expected was that Shi Cangying would try to ruin this good thing. How could he not be furious?

Ye Qinghan's pretty face also darkened as she looked at Shi Cangying and said, "Senior Uncle, Young Master Yang is a friend I invited. Please show them some courtesy."

Shi Cangying sneered, "This old man is naturally courteous to true friends, but I don't wish to see people who might bring disaster to the Sect. Let them leave."

Ye Qinghan shouted, "Impossible! Senior Uncle, you should apologize to Young Master Yang!"

"Insolence!" Shi Cangying flew into a rage, glaring at Ye Hen. "Sect Master, is this the good daughter you raised? She has no sense of respect or hierarchy, shouting at her Senior Uncle. What kind of example is this!"

Ye Hen said calmly, "Qinghan has always been gentle and kind. If she is angry, she must have her reasons."

"You... you all..." Shi Cangying's beard trembled wildly, looking utterly exasperated.

"It seems... my presence has caused some discord in your Sect," Yang Kai said with a smile, rubbing his nose.

"Brat, stop making sarcastic remarks," Shi Cangying growled, looking at Yang Kai with obvious displeasure.

Yang Kai laughed, "Sir, you're not young anymore. Don't get angry so easily; it's bad for your health."

"Stop pretending to be kind. If you were truly Ye Qinghan's friend, you'd think of her. Leaving Thousand Leaves Sect quickly is the right path." Shi Cangying seemed determined to drive Yang Kai away, making no effort to hide his intentions, repeating himself over and over.

Yang Kai grinned, "I told you not to get angry. Just a few days ago, there was an old fellow named Ke Tian who got angry at me like this... and then he died!"

As soon as these words left his mouth, Shi Cangying's expression changed dramatically. He retreated a few steps in alarm and exclaimed, "What are you trying to do?"

Although Yang Kai's words were brief and without the slightest threat, hearing them made Shi Cangying's hair stand on end, cold sweat soaking his clothes. Even Ye Hen's face changed, as if he was afraid Yang Kai would make a move here.

They had all heard the news that Yang Kai killed quite a few people in the City Lord’s mansion, including Ke Tian of Heavenly Extreme Hall. They hadn't dared believe it, but now that he admitted it himself, they had no choice but to accept it.

Yang Kai sneered, "By your logic, the strong are respected and power is king. Since I am stronger than you, shouldn't you behave yourself in front of me? Otherwise... I don't mind showing you the difference between us."

Upon hearing this, Chi Yue immediately fanned the flames from the side, "Yang boy is a big tree. Old man, do you want to lean on him? Don't miss this chance, or you'll regret it forever."

Ghost Ancestor cackled, "If you have any granddaughters or daughters, you can marry them off to Young Master Yang as concubines. Don't fail to appreciate your blessings."

Ai Ou and Chi Yue immediately glared at him and said in unison, "Eldest Brother, do you still want someone to take care of you in your old age?"

Ghost Ancestor broke out in a cold sweat and said awkwardly, "Pretend I didn't say anything."

Their words were full of barbs and mockery, making Shi Cangying's old face turn green and red. His Origin Qi surged, and he looked ready to attack at any moment. But remembering that even Ke Tian had died at Yang Kai's hands, he realized this young man's true strength couldn't be judged by cultivation alone. Fearful, he didn't dare act rashly, feeling so stifled he almost spat blood. He could only grit his teeth and shout angrily at Ye Hen, "Sect Master, are you just going to watch these outsiders humiliate your Sect's Vice Sect Master and do nothing?"

Ye Hen said in a deep voice, "Brother Shi, if you truly care for the Sect, let it go. Young Master Yang is Qinghan's guest, and thus a guest of our Sect. Our Sect does not treat guests this way!"

"You..." Shi Cangying glared at Ye Hen, suppressing his surging Qi and blood, and shouted, "Since Sect Master takes my good intentions as ill will, then Sect Master, do as you please!"

With that, he turned and left, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Seeing that Shi Cangying had really left, Ye Qinghan couldn't help but let out a breath, looking apologetically at Yang Kai. "Young Master Yang..."

As soon as she spoke, she suddenly stopped, her eyes filling with fear, because at that moment, Yang Kai was looking at her coldly, clearly very displeased.

"Miss Ye, give me an explanation. If you can't satisfy me, I'll take my leave and won't accompany you any further!" Yang Kai said coldly.

He was also full of anger.

He had only agreed to come to Thousand Leaves Sect because Ye Qinghan had pestered him. He was here to repair the Space Array for them, but before even entering the Sect, the Vice Sect Master had already tried to put him in his place. Although he hadn't really suffered any loss or humiliation, Yang Kai was still annoyed.

If not for the coincidence of finding Chi Yue and the others this time, which could be counted as Ye Qinghan's merit, Yang Kai wouldn't have bothered with them at all. With Shi Cangying's attitude and tone just now, he would have killed him on the spot.

On the other side, after hearing Yang Kai's words, both Ye Qinghan and Ye Hen's faces changed drastically. Ye Qinghan said in panic, "Young Master Yang, please don't be angry. Senior Uncle has always been at odds with my father, so that's why..."

Ye Hen patted Ye Qinghan's shoulder, interrupting her, and sighed to Yang Kai, "I can understand why you're angry, Young Master Yang. It's my poor hospitality that has wronged you. I apologize to you and everyone here. I hope you can give our Sect another chance."

As he spoke, he bowed deeply, his attitude extremely sincere.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, sensing his sincerity. His anger subsided a lot, and he said lightly, "Senior Ye, there's no need for this. I'm just curious—how can a mere Vice Sect Master dare to act so high and mighty in front of the Sect Master?"

Ye Hen gave a bitter smile, "A tiger without teeth... who would still fear it?"

"Father..." Tears welled up in Ye Qinghan's eyes as she called out softly.

Ye Hen smiled at her and said, "Birth, aging, sickness, and death are part of life. There's no need to be like this." Then he turned to Yang Kai and said, "Our Thousand Leaves Sect rose to fame through puppet techniques, once renowned throughout the Southern Territory. But our descendants were unfilial, the inheritance declined, and we gradually weakened. I am incompetent, and since taking charge of Thousand Leaves Sect, I have not been able to restore its former glory. There are inevitably some dissenting voices within the Sect. Vice Sect Master Shi and the others believe we should abandon puppet techniques and seek other cultivation methods and secret arts to revive the Sect's prestige. But the puppet path was passed down by our ancestors—how could I dare abandon it? If I did, wouldn't I be unfilial, unrighteous, and untrustworthy? Even in the afterlife, I would have no face to see my forebears."

Chi Yue mused, "If the Sect Master and Vice Sect Master have different views, how can the Sect develop?"

Ye Hen smiled bitterly, "Exactly. Now, Thousand Leaves Sect has already split into two factions—one conservative, one seeking change. Although it's not open hostility, there is some friction."

"And because you're getting older, he gives you no respect and even tries to suppress your prestige?" Ai Ou gradually understood.

"I've made a fool of myself before you all," Ye Hen said, looking dejected.

Du Xian and the others stood to the side, faces ashen, fists clenched, clearly feeling miserable.

Ye Qinghan wiped her tears and said, "Young Master Yang, what happened just now wasn't my father's intention. Please don't be angry."

Ye Hen said, "Although it was not my intention, as the Sect Master of Thousand Leaves Sect, I cannot escape responsibility. If Young Master Yang truly no longer wishes to help my Thousand Leaves Sect, I will not force you. I only hope you can be magnanimous and give our Sect another chance."

Yang Kai looked at him and said indifferently, "Vice Sect Master Shi may have been a bit annoying, but he wasn't wrong. I've made a lot of enemies. Aren't you afraid of bringing disaster upon yourself, Sect Master Ye?"

Ye Hen replied, "Even without you, our Sect is already a thorn in their side. Sooner or later, there will be bloodshed. Besides, so many people saw you with my daughter at the City Lord’s mansion. Even if you leave now, our Thousand Leaves Sect can't stay out of this."

Yang Kai grinned, "Sect Master Ye sees things much more clearly than Vice Sect Master Shi."

Ye Hen said, "Vice Sect Master Shi thinks that if you leave on your own, everything will be fine. That's just wishful thinking."

Yang Kai said, "What if even I can't do anything about it?"

Ye Hen pondered for a moment and said, "That's fate. Let things take their course. At least, when I meet our ancestors in the afterlife, I can tell them honestly that I tried my best!"

"Alright, then I'll give it a try," Yang Kai nodded.

Ye Qinghan was overjoyed and cried out, "Young Master Yang, are you going to stay?"

Ye Hen laughed heartily, "Silly girl, why even ask?" With that, he stepped aside and said, "Young Master Yang and everyone, please."

Yang Kai was no longer as overbearing as before and said politely, "Sect Master Ye, after you."

Ye Hen hesitated for a moment but still walked into Thousand Leaves Sect together with Yang Kai.

Along the way, Ghost Ancestor and the others looked around curiously, their eyes constantly flashing with amazement.

Although they had been in the Star Realm for two or three years, they had always stayed near Tianhe City. This was their first time entering a Sect.

Thousand Leaves Sect might be in decline now, but long ago it was one of the top Sects in the Southern Territory. Its accumulated foundation was far beyond what those small Sects could compare to. The ancient, desolate buildings and winding paths seemed to transcend time, connecting past and present, allowing one to glimpse the splendor of tens of thousands of years ago.
