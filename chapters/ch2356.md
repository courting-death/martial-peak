## Chapter 2356 — Hidden Dragons and Crouching Tigers

"Were you two the ones causing trouble at Jubao Tower just now?" Pang Guang went straight to the point as soon as he arrived, glaring coldly at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun. Clearly, he had learned their appearances through some unknown channel.

Liu Qianyun's pretty face turned pale, and she dared not answer.

She had only just advanced to the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and her cultivation was still unstable. Facing an Emperor Realm cultivator, the pressure was like a mountain.

Yang Kai, however, remained calm and unruffled, merely glancing indifferently at Pang Guang.

Compared to Qiu Ze, Pang Guang's aura was undoubtedly stronger and more robust. He was clearly superior to Qiu Ze, but not overwhelmingly so — with Yang Kai's current abilities, Yang Kai had nothing to fear from him.

Neither of them replied, and Pang Guang immediately roared in anger, "This Lord is asking you a question—how dare you not answer?"

Imperial Might swept out, filling the entire teahouse. The martial artists still drinking tea inside all turned pale, their expressions strained. The killing intent, thick as substance, seeped into their flesh and bones, making them feel icy cold. They cursed Yang Kai for being reckless before the City Lord, dragging them into trouble as well.

Yang Kai lightly waved his hand, as if a sharp sword had cut through the overcast sky. The Imperial Might enveloping them instantly vanished, like clouds parting to reveal a clear day.

Pang Guang was startled and began to reassess Yang Kai.

He clearly sensed that Yang Kai was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet with a single wave, he had dispersed his Imperial Might. What was going on? Though it was just a simple gesture, Pang Guang no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai. Realizing that Yang Kai dared to sit here so brazenly after causing a scene at Jubao Tower, he must have something to rely on.

Could this guy be from some top Sect? If not, how could he have such a deep foundation?

It was said that the elite disciples of those top Sects possessed the strength to fight above their realm. If this young man really came from a great Sect, today's matter would be difficult to handle.

For a moment, Pang Guang’s heart was filled with uncertainty and anxiety. As the City Lord, his authority had been thoroughly challenged—his industry overturned, his experts either dead or wounded. If he couldn’t force the other party to give a satisfactory explanation, where would he put his dignity?

But if the other party had a powerful background, he might not be able to afford offending them. Though Pang Guang was like a local tyrant in Gao City, in the eyes of those top Sects, he was nothing. They could send an Elder at random to wipe him out dozens or hundreds of times over.

As his thoughts raced, trying to figure out how to resolve today's matter without offending anyone and still saving face, he suddenly sensed something amiss nearby.

He was startled and turned his head, only to see a middle-aged man appear at his side without him noticing. The man had a head of white hair, looked energetic, and wore a plain gray hemp robe, appearing utterly unremarkable.

When did this old fellow arrive?

Pang Guang was filled with suspicion. He had been so focused on Yang Kai that he hadn't noticed when the old man approached. Moreover, the old man's face was completely unfamiliar—he was certain he had never seen him before.

The old man's sudden appearance also startled Yang Kai.

Pang Guang had been distracted just now and hadn't paid attention to the old man's arrival, but Yang Kai had seen it clearly.

The middle-aged old man had appeared without any warning, as if he had materialized in the blink of an eye.

Yang Kai's mind tensed, and he quietly released his Divine Sense to probe the old man's cultivation. To his shock, his Divine Sense vanished without a trace as soon as it entered the old man's body, like a stone sinking into the sea.

This person... was even more formidable than Pang Guang! At the very least, he was at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, and quite possibly the Third Stage.

There was actually such an expert hidden in Gao City? Yang Kai was shaken inside, but outwardly remained calm as he glanced at Pang Guang. If these two were together, this would be troublesome. He had thought there was only Pang Guang in Gao City and thus had no fear, but now that an even stronger old man had appeared, Yang Kai was already considering how to escape safely.

However, upon closer inspection, Yang Kai felt somewhat relieved, because Pang Guang also looked suspicious and uneasy at this moment. Clearly, he didn't know this middle-aged old man.

To be the City Lord and yet not know the hidden dragons and crouching tigers in his own territory—one had to say, Pang Guang was quite a failure as a City Lord.

At this moment, the middle-aged man's eyes shone with interest, as if he had discovered something fascinating. He smiled slightly at Yang Kai and said, "This old man is Yao Changjun, the owner of this teahouse. How should I address you, Young Brother?"

His face was kindly, like an approachable elder, but Yang Kai instinctively sensed a trace of danger.

Before Yang Kai could reply, Pang Guang suddenly snorted coldly and said, "I have business to discuss with this young man. Irrelevant people should leave first."

He acted high and mighty, as if he didn't take Yao Changjun seriously at all.

At these words, Yang Kai's expression immediately became odd.

But soon, he understood. Pang Guang probably didn't know Yao Changjun's true strength. Otherwise, he would never dare speak like this. Plus, after failing to show off before Yang Kai, and now being ignored by Yao Changjun, he was likely feeling humiliated.

It was one thing for Yang Kai to ignore him, but for a mere teahouse owner under his jurisdiction to do the same?

As City Lord, how could Pang Guang tolerate this?

"You want this old man to leave?" Yao Changjun chuckled, looking at Pang Guang with great interest. His voice turned cold: "Are you sure?"

Only now did Pang Guang realize something was wrong. He hurriedly released his Divine Sense to probe Yao Changjun's cultivation, but it was already too late. Before his Divine Sense could even touch Yao Changjun, the latter lightly slapped a palm at him and coldly snorted, "A mere First Stage Emperor dares to act up before this old man? Get lost!"

In his palm, Origin Qi surged like a swirling galaxy, containing immense power.

With a single palm, heaven and earth trembled.

Pang Guang's face changed dramatically. He finally realized he had provoked someone he shouldn't have. In shock, he hurriedly retreated, exclaiming in terror, "Senior, please forgive me!"

But no matter how he dodged or defended, that palm still landed squarely on his chest. With a loud sound, Pang Guang was sent flying like a ragged sack, crashing through dozens of buildings before landing in a sorry state, spitting blood.

On the third floor of Yueting Teahouse, the once noisy martial artists fell into a deathly silence.

Everyone who witnessed this scene nearly had their eyes pop out.

The City Lord of Gao City, Pang Guang, a First Stage Emperor, had actually been sent flying by a single palm from a middle-aged man!

And this middle-aged man was actually the owner of Yueting Teahouse!

If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they would never have believed it.

So, in Gao City, the true expert was not the City Lord, but the hidden teahouse owner!

To be able to send Pang Guang flying with one palm, just how high was this teahouse owner's cultivation? Second Stage Emperor? Or Third Stage?

Everyone was utterly shocked. Some recalled how they had once thrown tantrums in Yueting Teahouse, deliberately making things difficult for the staff. Instantly, a chill ran from their heads to their feet, as if they had fallen into an ice cellar.

Only now did they realize that Yueting Teahouse was absolutely not a place where they could act recklessly. With the owner's cultivation, if he truly wanted to take their lives, even Pang Guang wouldn't dare utter a word. The reason he ignored them was simply because he didn't care.

From now on, they would never cause trouble here again! Every martial artist secretly swore in their hearts.

"Now we can talk." After sending Pang Guang flying, Yao Changjun smiled and sat down opposite Yang Kai, looking completely at ease, as if what had just happened was no more than swatting a fly.

Liu Qianyun was completely dumbfounded, her face bloodless and her teeth chattering. She had thought offending Pang Guang was bad enough, but now an even more formidable figure had appeared.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and asked in a low voice, "Senior, what is it you wish to discuss with me?" After witnessing Yao Changjun's display just now, Yang Kai was certain this old man was far from the kindly figure he appeared to be. On the contrary, he was a capricious old monster whose moods could shift in an instant.

How could Yang Kai dare to let his guard down against such a person?

As he spoke, Yang Kai inconspicuously tucked the jade box in his hand into his robe.

But his action did not escape Yao Changjun's notice. The teahouse owner simply reached out, and the box in Yang Kai's hand flew into his palm.

Yang Kai's face instantly darkened. He realized Yao Changjun must have sensed the aura of the Divine Butian Lotus, which was why he had suddenly appeared. Such a miraculous treasure was of great use to any martial artist.

Otherwise, he would not have snatched it so directly.

If he had known this would happen, Yang Kai would never have unlocked the box's seal here. Who could have guessed that a hidden old monster was lurking in the teahouse? He sighed inwardly, hoping Yao Changjun did not know the true secret of the Divine Butian Lotus.

"Let's talk about this." Yao Changjun chuckled, giving Yang Kai a look that said, "Don't try to play tricks with me." As he spoke, he gently cracked open the jade box. Instantly, his expression became solemn, as if the item inside were a priceless treasure.

A faint fragrance drifted from the box, and Yao Changjun's eyes shone with a terrifying light. Delighted, he exclaimed, "Indeed, it is this! I've waited here for two hundred years, and it was not in vain. Hahahaha!"

Yang Kai's face instantly fell.

From Yao Changjun's words, Yang Kai knew the old man recognized the Divine Butian Lotus. Moreover, this old fellow had hidden himself here, running a teahouse for over two hundred years just for this treasure!

The old man's demeanor changed in an instant. Gone was the previous warmth—now his tone was cold and menacing, as if daring Yang Kai to try deceiving him. "Boy, tell me honestly—where did you get this thing?" he demanded, his eyes fixed greedily on the jade box. It was clear that if Yang Kai dared to lie, he would not let him off lightly.
