## Chapter 1659 — Discussing Official Matters

Seeing him so calm and composed, Luo Li quietly nodded and reached out to pour tea into the cup before Yang Kai, saying, “Taste my Xuejian Hanrui.” Clear tea flowed and a refreshing fragrance met them.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted; he lifted the cup, sniffed it a few times near his nostrils, a look of rapture crossing his face, then tossed his head back and drained the cup, even biting down on a tea leaf and chewing it continuously.

Luo Li was slightly taken aback, then smiled: “It seems Young Hero Yang has not studied the Dao of Tea deeply.”

“Never did,” Yang Kai chuckled. “I’ve been running about all these years, haven’t had the time or inclination to study such things.”

“A natural sentiment; the young hero is still youthful yet possesses earth-shattering cultivation—of course you are a person of arduous endeavor.”

“You flatter me, elder, but though I haven’t delved into tea ceremony, I can taste that this tea clears the mind, suppresses desires, and dispels evil and quells fire. You gave me this first—what are you worried about?” Yang Kai said, half-smiling.

Luo Li sighed softly: “Young Hero Yang, why ask what you already know?”

Yang Kai’s face grew serious and he said, “Then this Junior will speak plainly: the Ice Heart Valley’s previous attitude and actions truly angered me. For a moment I even wanted to raze the entire Ice Heart Valley!”

Luo Li’s expression did not change; she simply watched Yang Kai quietly, waiting for him to continue.

“But thinking it over now, that was only youthful hot-blooded impulse. It wasn’t necessary. Besides, even if I truly wished it, Su Yan would not agree.”

When Yang Kai mentioned Su Yan, a trace of melancholy flickered across Luo Li’s face. “Su Yan is a good child. I have instructed her a few times — her comprehension, aptitude, and temperament were all exceptional. If not for what happened this time, Su Yan would surely have become the pillar of Ice Heart Valley, leading it toward a new era of glory.”

“It’s a pity there are no ‘ifs’.” Yang Kai gave a cold smile.

“This time Ice Heart Valley was at fault; I, Luo Li, am at fault. Young Hero Yang, be magnanimous and let bygones be bygones. Luo Li thanks you!” As she spoke, Luo Li rose and offered Yang Kai a graceful bow.

Yang Kai frowned, but his expression softened. After a moment he replied, “You overstate, elder. You are a Void King Realm expert. I am only Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; your words are too flattering.”

Luo Li shook her head solemnly: “Better to offend the old than provoke the young. I am aged, and you still have a bright future. Though my view may be short-sighted, I know your prospects are boundless.”

Yang Kai laughed heartily: “I accept your auspicious words, elder.”

The laughter stopped and Yang Kai grew earnest: “Since you are so frank, I’ll be frank: from now on, Su Yan and Qing Ya are no longer Ice Heart Valley disciples, and I’ll not press the past deeds of Ice Heart Valley further.”

A faint gloom flickered across Luo Li’s face as she inclined her head: “Very well. It was a lack of fortune and opportunity for Ice Heart Valley; I cannot blame others.”

“If the elder thinks so, all the better,” Yang Kai said, satisfied.

Luo Li was easy to reason with. Yang Kai’s main purpose in coming had been to take Qing Ya away, but he also wanted to meet this Grand Elder of Ice Heart Valley and formally sever Su Yan’s ties to the sect.

After all, Ice Heart Valley raised and taught Su Yan and Qing Ya for more than thirty years—its merits were great. Though its actions at the end infuriated and disappointed Yang Kai immensely, some things still needed to be said plainly.

“Enough of private matters, let’s talk official business,” Yang Kai’s expression changed as he grinned at Luo Li with the look of a crafty merchant, as if about to propose a bargain.

Luo Li blinked: “Official business? What official business?”

Even with her quick wit, she found it hard to keep pace with the sudden change in Yang Kai’s train of thought.

“The Fire Radiance Sect and Ice Heart Valley have been at each other’s throats on Chi Lan Star for thousands to tens of thousands of years, with indelible blood feuds between them. Countless Ice Heart Valley disciples have fallen at the hands of Fire Radiance Sect warriors. Now that Fire Radiance’s Grand Elder Chi Huo has been slain by me, does the elder have no thoughts?” Yang Kai smiled at Luo Li and said slowly, “For instance, sweeping the root to prevent future troubles and so on.”

Luo Li’s face changed; she stared at Yang Kai in shock: “Young hero, you are indeed a ruthless man.”

“Hmph. A man who is not ruthless cannot stand firm,” Yang Kai sneered.

A glimmer of brilliance flashed in Luo Li’s beautiful eyes. “Now, that is a saying both elegant and insightful — it seems I has underestimated you, young hero.”

“So what does the elder mean?”

“To be honest, young hero, I have long had such thoughts. With Chi Huo dead, the Fire Radiance Sect is now leaderless, and this is indeed the perfect time to resolve the millennia-old feud between our two sects. However… I lack the strength to make it happen.”

Yang Kai mused and nodded gently: “Elder means your hidden injuries and the mental hazard affecting your spirit?”

“Young hero has a sharp eye,” Luo Li did not deny.

Her hidden injuries came from a previous training mishap, and the mental hazard was left when she decided to give up Su Yan; the latter worsened the former, which is why Luo Li had held back.

Otherwise, given the feud between the two sects, she would have gone to the Fire Radiance Mountain Range the very day Chi Huo was slain and uprooted the Fire Radiance Sect.

“Even so, with the elder’s methods, is it really impossible to take the Fire Radiance Sect?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

“You jest.” Luo Li chuckled and shook her head. “At my prime, I might have had seventy percent chance to breach the sect’s Protective Mountain Array, but under current circumstances… difficult. Although the Fire Radiance Sect currently lacks Void King Realm experts to guard it, the sect still houses many Origin Returning Realm peak masters who, combined with the Protective Mountain Array, could very well keep me at bay.”

“I had underestimated the Fire Radiance Sect,” Yang Kai said, stroking his chin with a trace of gravity.

After all, it was a giant sect with a legacy of over ten thousand years and thus possessed considerable foundation.

“But… what if I could restore the elder to her prime, remove the hidden injuries and mental hazard, and assist you from the side?” Yang Kai suddenly smiled mysteriously.

“What?” Luo Li was startled, drawing her brows together: “You say you can restore me to my prime?”

“Indeed!”

“But injuries like mine cannot be healed by ordinary spiritual pills; only Void King-Grade pills, and specific kinds at that, will work!” Luo Li’s face changed as she realized something and exclaimed: “Could you be a Void King-Grade alchemist?”

Yang Kai smiled without answering, inscrutable: “Whether I am or not, elder, wait and see. I require these materials. With Ice Heart Valley’s foundation, you should be able to produce them. Now listen…”

Yang Kai recited a list of medicinal ingredients, each one a Void King-Grade material.

Luo Li was utterly stunned; she took careful note while regarding Yang Kai with an incredulous gaze that made her whole frame tremble.

All signs suggested this youth might indeed be a Void King-Grade alchemist—at the very least he had one backing him—otherwise why ask for so many materials?

A tempest of shock rose in Luo Li’s heart, unable to subside for quite some time.

Void King-Grade alchemists are as rare in the Star Domain as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns; you can count them on one hand. These people are famed and revered— even a top Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert would pay them great respect and never show the slightest neglect.

They are the truly exalted among the Star Domain.

If this youth before her truly was a Void King-Grade alchemist, Ice Heart Valley’s loss this time would be grievous indeed.

At the thought her vision dimmed and she nearly fainted, but her temperament and cultivation steadied her; she forced herself to remain clear-headed despite the shock.

“These materials shouldn’t be hard to find, right?” Yang Kai asked Luo Li.

“I will have people search the stores at once. The items you mentioned should be in stock!”

“Good. I’ll also need a sealed chamber.”

“I will arrange it!” Luo Li immediately nodded.

“All right, I’ll return in three days. Elder, wait and see!” Yang Kai stood.

“Young Hero Yang…” Luo Li rose and called after him.

“Is there anything else, elder?”

“I wish to ask—why do you so deliberately seek to destroy the Fire Radiance Sect? Although Wei Feng once humiliated Su Yan, he is dead. Apart from that, the Fire Radiance Sect seemed not to have provoked you. Surely you are not doing this solely to help Ice Heart Valley?”

“Who says they never provoked me?” Yang Kai snorted. “They provoked me many times. But that is not the main cause. I target the Fire Radiance Sect because I want their Qiantian Thunderflame!”

Luo Li’s expression changed, and she exclaimed in a low voice, “Young hero, what an enormous appetite you have! That Qiantian Thunderflame is the very foundation upon which the Fire Radiance Sect was built. It’s said to have gained sentience and possesses unfathomable power. The greatest reason this palace has never dared to intrude upon the Fire Radiance Sect is precisely because of that mass of Qiantian Thunderflame!”

“Is that so? Excellent. If it makes the elder so fearful, then the Qiantian Thunderflame must be extraordinary. I mean to claim it!” Yang Kai laughed happily.

“You…” Luo Li stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, thinking him mad—fearless even of the thing that had terrified her; she wondered what leverage he had.

She hoped he was not all talk.

Luo Li prayed silently.

Her expression fluctuated as if she had made a weighty decision, then she spoke again: “Young Hero Yang, if possible, could you have Su Yan come see me once more? I have something to say to her.”

Yang Kai regarded her seriously for a long while before nodding: “Fine. I’ll bring Su Yan to see you tonight. Farewell for now.”

“Thank you, young hero,” Luo Li nodded slightly.

Yang Kai descended Ice Jue Peak. Qing Ya, who had been waiting beneath the peak for his safe return, breathed a sigh of relief when she saw him.

Bing Long, evidently having received a summons from Luo Li, immediately came forward and said, “Young Master Yang, please follow me.”

“Much obliged!”

In short order Yang Kai was settled in a pavilion on the inner island, and the medicinal ingredients he had requested were gathered within half an hour and personally delivered by Bing Long.
