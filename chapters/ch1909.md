## Chapter 1909 — Heaven's Jealousy of the Talented

It was exactly as such: in this moment Zuo De carried a trace of a true master's bearing; his fluid, cloud-like movements, his mastery of timing and heat, and his deep knowledge of medicinal properties instantly conquered every alchemist present, leaving them dazzled, wishing this scene would last forever, never to end.

Though the crowd's chatter was loud, not a word reached Zuo De's ears.

He had sunk wholly into a state of self-forgetfulness; by that alone it was clear his standing as a Void King-Grade alchemist was no stroke of luck, but the result of genuine, consummate ability.

Even Yang Kai, who stood not far away, could not help but be astonished at the sight.

Martial Dao, like the Pill Dao, demanded the investment of one's whole being to attain results; those who tried to split their focus or chase hollow ambitions would never go far.

He wasted no time; seeing Zuo De begin refining the pill, Yang Kai took a deep breath, set his mind, and in an instant his expression grew solemn and his eyes sharpened with intent.

It was as if in his gaze there remained only the cauldron and the assortment of herbs before him, nothing else.

Yang Kai too slipped into that state of forgetting the self in a single instant.

His opponent was an established Void King-Grade alchemist; he could not afford to be careless.

Ai Ou brightened, asking Zong Ao in a low, delighted voice, “Master Zong, I think Brother Yang's posture here... is in no way inferior to Zuo De. Could he actually refine pills?”

Zong Ao smiled slightly and replied softly, “That Yang Kai can refine pills, I can guarantee. I once saw him personally refine a Spiritual Pill. Not just once — he even produced a Spiritual Pill with a Pill Cloud!”

“What?” Ai Ou was shocked. “He actually has such ability? Master Zong isn't lying to me?”

“How could I joke about such a thing?” Zong Ao's eyes clouded with recollection. “When that Spiritual Pill came into being I stood by and watched; I gained much. However...”

“However what?”

“At that time the Spiritual Pill's grade wasn't high, and the Pill Cloud was perhaps a fluke,” Zong Ao said candidly. “Today Yang Kai is set to refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill. Whether he can produce it I dare not say. Yet his pillcraft and natural talent in the Pill Dao are undeniably top-tier. If the chairman keeps watching... uh...”

As Zong Ao spoke, Yang Kai began tossing the materials Ai Ou had just handed him into the Purple Void Cauldron.

Unlike Master Zuo De's fluid, practiced movements, Yang Kai threw the ingredients in all at once — nearly a haphazard heave — then slammed the cauldron lid shut, offering no spectacle.

Even those who knew nothing of pillcraft saw a problem.

Xue Yue's heart sank.

Ai Ou gaped, at a loss for words, though still clutching a sliver of hope as he asked Zong Ao, “Master Zong... Yang Kai is doing this for some reason?”

“I don't know either,” Zong Ao answered, flustered.

Which alchemist would toss all the materials into the cauldron at once? Every Spiritual Pill's refinement required precise control over the order and timing of ingredient insertion; each time an herb was put in the cauldron, the alchemist expended mind and spirit to control the furnace's heat, harmonizing it with the right hand seals to meld the liquid.

It was a step-by-step process, a careful, slow craft.

Only by such means could a master produce a high-quality Spiritual Pill.

“He'll ruin the herbs that way,” Zong Ao cried out in alarm. “Each herb reacts to temperature differently; when he draws on the earth-fire later, it will definitely go badly.”

The magnitude of earth-fire could be controlled, but it was never as flexible as a cultivator's own Saint Yuan. Hadn't they all seen Master Zuo De repeatedly adjust the formation to change the earth-fire's intensity? That was why herbs were added one by one — this was not a stew to be dumped in at once.

“Could he be admitting defeat before starting, thinking he can't beat Zuo De and giving up?” Ai Ou proposed a possibility.

Yang Kai had proposed competing with Zuo De over refining the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill to try and wake Gu Bihu. If Zuo De accepted the duel, Gu Bihu might recover; whether Yang Kai won or lost would be another matter.

“He isn't that rash — look more closely!” Xue Yue bit her thin lip, her palm sweating, her beautiful eyes fixed unwaveringly on him.

After dumping nearly all the materials in, Yang Kai did not activate any formation to draw earth-fire; instead he closed his eyes, sat cross-legged, utterly still, forming a subtle spiritual seal with his hands.

This sight made Zhan Yuan, who had been watching Yang Kai, laugh aloud: “I thought the fellow had some skill, but he doesn't even know the basics of pillcraft — he chucked all the herbs into the cauldron, hahahaha!”

The alchemists nearby glanced toward Yang Kai, then shook their heads; someone said, “What a waste, such fine herbs thrown away — it's despicable.”

To an alchemist, every good herb must be given the chance to do its work.

Yang Kai's apparent waste naturally provoked dissatisfaction.

Those who had felt sympathy for him now stared with resentment.

Suddenly, a surge of burning energy rolled out from Yang Kai; it felt strangely mutable, gentle and ferocious at once, hard to discern.

It was as if fires of many temperatures had gathered together, neither clashing nor fusing — eerie and unfathomable.

“Where did that burning power come from?”

“Weird, he didn't draw earth-fire, and there's no sign of Saint Yuan flow — how could that force be emanating?”

Many alchemists stared at Yang Kai in puzzlement.

“Divine Sense Fire!” Zhan Yuan had been uncertain at first, but then realization struck; he exclaimed under his breath, eyes alight with fervor and covetousness.

“What? Divine Sense Fire?”

“That man possesses Divine Sense Fire?”

One by one the alchemists stood with mouths agape — nearly big enough to fit an egg — all turning to fix their gaze on Yang Kai, every face alight with unrestrained excitement.

Divine Sense Fire was the alchemist's and artificer's supreme advantage — those who wielded it could halve their work and double their results when forging Spiritual Pills or Secret Treasures.

That was common knowledge everyone accepted.

But how many in the world possessed Divine Sense Fire? Among them, how many had the aptitude for pillcraft or artificing? Of the more than five hundred alchemists present, not one — not even Zuo De — possessed Divine Sense Fire.

Yet Yang Kai did!

Even Zuo De, who had been serene and lost in his work, could not help lifting his head to glance at Yang Kai, surprise flickering in his old eyes.

He soon withdrew his gaze, no longer paying attention to Yang Kai.

He knew pillcraft demanded wholehearted, single‑minded focus; watching others would only muddle one's spirit. Divine Sense Fire—so what? Could it compare to this old man's more than a thousand years' worth of hard‑won experience in the Pill Dao? Across the entire Star Domain, those who wield Divine Sense Fire are few, and not one of them is a Void King‑Grade alchemist.

"And I am!" Zuo De sneered inwardly.

“Damn it!” Zhan Yuan ground his teeth in resentment, vexed that such a brilliant alchemist as he lacked Divine Sense Fire while Yang Kai had it.

And with that earlier Void King‑Grade alchemical furnace on top of everything, Zhan Yuan suddenly felt that Heavens were jealous of the talented, and the Heavenly Dao was unjust!

If he had such a Void King-Grade furnace and Divine Sense Fire to assist him, he would surely match his master one day — no, surpass him, achieving unprecedented feats.

Only now did Zhan Yuan understand why Yang Kai had behaved so oddly earlier.

This fellow possessed Divine Sense Fire, and it seemed his control of it had reached an exquisite level. With that advantage, throwing all the herbs into the cauldron at once posed little problem: by dividing and directing his Divine Sense Fire to each herb's melting point, he could control the heat individually!

For a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, was that so difficult? Zhan Yuan thought it over and, annoyed, realized it should be quite simple.

Indeed, when Yang Kai activated his Divine Sense Fire, Ai Ou's anxiety vanished and a faint smile appeared on his face.

With Divine Sense Fire aiding him, Yang Kai need not draw on the earth-fire at all.

He could feel Yang Kai's Divine Sense fragmenting into countless strands of varying intensity; those dispersed flames poured into the Purple Void Cauldron, enveloping the herbs he had tossed in and beginning to condense the medicinal liquid.

Medicinal liquid refined by Divine Sense Fire was purer and more thorough than that forged by earth-fire!

Ai Ou even sensed Yang Kai's Divine Sense within the Purple Void Cauldron constantly shifting; intricate formations of all sizes flashed into being and vanished within the furnace at astonishing speed, while Yang Kai continually altered the seals in his hands.

The motions were not fast nor showy, yet the hand seals were profoundly mysterious, as if not of this realm.

Zong Ao's mind sank into the little world Yang Kai had created.

He differed from Ai Ou.

Ai Ou was an outsider watching the spectacle and could only grasp the surface, but Zong Ao was an Origin-Grade Upper-Level alchemist; from Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire transformations, the formations' birth and death in the cauldron, and the changes in his hand seals, he glimpsed many profound truths of Pill Dao.

He fell into thought, his eyes gleaming; he seemed to swim in the ocean of Pill Dao, oblivious to all else.

The deeper he pondered, the more he gained; often Yang Kai's timing of a heat or a shift in a hand seal would touch his inner doubts and drive him to seek answers.
