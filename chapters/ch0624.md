## Chapter 624 — From Which Ragged Corner Did He Come Out?

Yun Xuan stepped forward and bowed to the Transcendent Realm expert: "Uncle Sun, sorry to have kept you waiting."

Sun Ying smiled and shook his head. "I only arrived not long ago myself. Miss Yun, how have you been these past days?"

"Everything is fine. Thank you for your concern, Uncle Sun."

"Hm." Sun Ying nodded slightly and said in a low voice, "If you have the time, go see your father more often, he..."

"Uncle Sun!" Yun Xuan frowned, not wanting him to continue.

"All right, all right, I won't say any more." Sun Ying looked utterly helpless.

Yang Kai watched the exchanges closely, quickly catching on to certain matters; he kept silent and remained an observer.

Yun Xuan nodded toward the small-statured woman. "Sister Ruan, I hope you have been well."

Ruan Xinyu snorted coldly, displeased. "You would have been more helpful if you'd come sooner. I've already been waiting here several days. If the Alliance hadn't insisted you take some credit, my squad would have long since dealt with this trouble."

Yun Xuan smiled faintly. "Sister Ruan, you're joking. If the Alliance arranged it this way, it must be because you couldn't do without us."

Ruan Xinyu's pretty face grew cold. Just as she was about to snap back, Sun Ying clapped his hands and said, "Enough, both of you, keep it down. You two girls, the moment you meet you start quarreling. You're both disciples of the Alliance—what deep hatred is there between you that can't be settled?"

Faced with Sun Ying's mediation, Ruan Xinyu remained icy and distant, while Yun Xuan's smile was all surface and no warmth, leaving the Transcendent Realm expert rather troubled.

"Ah..." Suddenly Sun Ying looked at Yang Kai with a puzzled expression. "Miss Yun, why does your squad have an extra person? Is he an Alliance disciple?"

As he spoke, he appraised Yang Kai from head to toe, sweeping his Divine Sense over him. After detecting his cultivation, Sun Ying nodded slightly, thinking his strength not too poor, but Yang Kai bore no mark of a Duao Alliance disciple, which puzzled him.

"He's not an Alliance disciple," Yun Xuan shook her head.

Even Ruan Xinyu and Zhou Luo were stunned.

Alliance disciples never bring unrelated people along on missions; Yun Xuan's action clearly baffled them.

"He wishes to join our Duao Alliance. I brought him here to see how he performs," Yun Xuan explained with a smile, slyly giving Yang Kai a look.

Yang Kai understood the hint and fell silent.

"Is that so." Sun Ying relaxed. "That's fine. Then let me see how much potential he has. If he passes the test, which team should he be assigned to? Yun Xuan, your squad is already full."

"If you don't mind, how about joining my squad?" Zhou Luo offered.

Yang Kai frowned, uncertain how to reply, when Yun Xuan spoke up: "It's far from decided. He might not meet the Alliance's requirements. Let's finish this mission first."

"Very well." Zhou Luo smiled and nodded. "Brother, do your best. I believe Yun Xuan's eye for talent won't be wrong; don't embarrass her this time."

Ruan Xinyu sized Yang Kai up and sneered in disdain. "Greenhorn!"

Yang Kai said nothing, which made her think the youth was a bit dim-witted. Coupled with her grudge against Yun Xuan, she naturally disliked Yang Kai.

"Xinyu, you arrived earlier and your squad was responsible for scouting this area; tell us the situation." Although Sun Ying had already used Divine Sense to probe the situation over there, he did not want to waste breath and asked Ruan Xinyu to explain.

Mentioning the mission, Ruan Xinyu's expression turned stern. "The situation here matches the intelligence we received. The demonic beasts that suddenly appeared are all Gold Devouring Beasts; they mainly consume mineral deposits, and our Ri Xi mineral vein is the reason they were drawn here. There are quite a number—at least forty or fifty, most are Sixth-Tier, some are Fifth-Tier, and we found no sign of any Seventh-Tier."

"Gold Devouring Beasts?" Yun Xuan's eyes brightened at the name.

"Yes, Gold Devouring Beasts. You should all have heard of them and know why they're valuable."

Zhou Luo became excited. "Of course we know. If we can capture all forty or fifty of them alive, we won't have to worry about the refiner situation. With these demonic beasts, the Ri Xi vein can be refined at will; it would be a great boon to the Alliance."

Sun Ying smiled slightly. "Your three squads each have capable members. Dealing with Sixth-Tier demonic beasts should be no problem, provided you don't let them swarm you. Our goal is to capture these demonic beasts alive, not to kill them—remember that. Losing a single one would be a loss for us; understand?"

Everyone nodded in unison, eager and motivated, as if the Gold Devouring Beasts meant tremendous reward for them.

Yang Kai looked puzzled.

"Yun Xuan, Zhou Luo, Xinyu, each of you take half your team and, with me, lay down the restraining formations to prevent these beasts from escaping. It's getting dark; the others should rest here. Once we've finished the formations, we'll act at dawn." Sun Ying commanded.

After a short while, half of Duao Alliance followed Sun Ying out to make the arrangements nearby.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged and recuperated his spirit.

A bearded man with a surly expression came over and sat opposite Yang Kai, looking somewhat bored.

He was displeased at not being brought along by Yun Xuan.

"Brother Ji, what exactly are Gold Devouring Beasts like? Why did everyone get so excited when they heard the name?" Yang Kai hesitated before asking the question that had been nagging him.

On the way here, he had thought this group came to slay the beasts for their cores and materials, but upon arrival the mission had become to capture them, which made Yang Kai realize living Gold Devouring Beasts were worth more than dead ones.

Hearing Yang Kai's question, Ji Hong widened his mouth in astonishment. "You haven't heard of Gold Devouring Beasts?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

"Which ragged corner did you crawl out of?" Ji Hong said with a look of incredulous contempt, regarding Yang Kai like a country bumpkin.

Yang Kai gave an awkward little laugh.

"I'm really impressed," Ji Hong kept shaking his head and patiently explained, "Gold Devouring Beasts—just the name should give you a hint. These demonic beasts don't eat flesh and blood; they feed on minerals. Their physiology is peculiar: after consuming ore they refine it within their bodies and then excrete the refined mineral."

"Isn't that just excrement?" Yang Kai's face darkened.

"You could say that, but their excrement is of great use to us. The minerals they excrete are purer than what many refineries can produce. With that, you should understand why we seek to capture them alive rather than slay them."

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded. "You plan to bring them back to the Alliance to use them to refine ores and materials."

"Exactly. With this batch of Gold Devouring Beasts, the Alliance can save a great deal of manpower; our refineries can free their craftsmen to do other things." Ji Hong's face shone with excitement. "Forty or fifty of them is no small number. The more our squad catches, the better the reward—we might be promoted to squad leader, standing on equal footing with Yun Xuan, hehe."

Ji Hong wore a glossy grin, looking brimming with vigor.

"What's the situation with Yun Xuan?" Yang Kai suddenly asked. He had noticed many things in recent days and felt Yun Xuan's identity wasn't quite ordinary, yet she always claimed to be an Ordinary Disciple of Duao Alliance, which puzzled him.

Ji Hong's expression abruptly turned serious. After hesitating, he said, "I can't speak about the captain. If you want to know, ask her yourself, though I doubt she'll tell you."

Yang Kai lightly inclined his head and said no more.

Around midnight Sun Ying and the others returned; the formations had been fully set and all that remained was to act at dawn.

In the second half of the night everyone sat in meditation to restore themselves, awaiting the performance of the coming day.

A faint fragrance drifted and lingered at his nostrils. Yang Kai opened his eyes; dawn was approaching—the darkest moment before daybreak—when Yun Xuan stood before him in a distinctive outfit, her bearing peerless.

"Something wrong?" Yang Kai tilted his head.

"We're about to move. Be careful. Follow behind me and obey my commands; don't make any mistakes. If you die, I won't have a good explanation to Miss Shui." 

"I understand."

"Earlier when I said you might join Duao Alliance, it was only offhand. Whether you join or not depends on you." Yun Xuan tucked some hair behind her ear, revealing a delicate earlobe, smiling with a gentle softness of a ripe peach.

Gazing at the strip of pale light on the horizon, Yun Xuan suddenly asked, "How old are you this year?"

"Twenty, I suppose." Yang Kai smiled.

"Twenty, Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage—time flies." Yun Xuan's eyes momentarily grew distant as if lost in memory, then she pursed her lips and smiled. "A beautiful age. Don't die; if you die you'll see nothing more."

Yang Kai's expression flickered; he felt there was more behind her words and was about to question her when Sun Ying's shout came from the other side: "Prepare to move."

Everyone opened their eyes, their gazes shining.

Yun Xuan's expression turned grave and she hurriedly summoned her team.

Moments later everyone was ready and, led by Sun Ying, set off toward the Ri Xi mineral vein.

On the mountainside a dark, blackened cave mouth yawned—this was the mine Duao Alliance possessed in Qianye Forest. Yang Kai sensed around him and subconsciously detected the energy traces of the formations the Alliance had laid last night.

A vast Divine Sense silently and slyly slipped into the mine in the mountain and soon detected the presence of demonic beasts, confirming the earlier reports: most were indeed Sixth-Tier.

"Open!" Sun Ying shouted, and his hands wove one strand of pure True Yuan after another, the True Yuan scattering outward and imprinting into the void before vanishing.
