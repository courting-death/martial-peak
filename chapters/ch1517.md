## Chapter 1517 — No More Battle Sky Alliance

"We wouldn't dare!" Liang Yong exclaimed, startled, hastily bowing his head. "We swear to heaven that from this day forth we will submit to Sect Master Yang and follow his lead, and if there are requests we will gladly wade through fire and water to fulfill them."

"If swearing worked, Alliance Master Qu and Elder Mo wouldn't have died so miserably here. The day you all joined the Battle Sky Alliance, didn't you make vows then?" Yang Kai curled his lip.

Liang Yong's expression turned awkward, but beneath that was a far deeper anxiety; at this point he had no clear plan for how to earn Yang Kai's trust and plead for mercy.

If Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng had still been alive earlier, the Battle Sky Alliance might have had a fighting chance; now they were nothing but fish on a chopping block, to be kneaded and crushed at Yang Kai's whim. Liang Yong and the others had no strength left to resist.

"I'll give you one chance to persuade me — make me feel there's some use in letting you live. If you fail, don't blame this Sect Master for showing no mercy. Elder Liang is no soft hand either; you should understand that." Yang Kai's voice, impatient, carried over, his eyes growing icy.

Liang Yong shivered violently, realizing Yang Kai was not merely posturing; in his panic his mind raced for a way out.

The others watched Liang Yong like starving dogs, every heart lodged in their throats.

Yang Kai did not hurry them; he stood where he was and waited quietly.

After a long while Liang Yong's tense look finally eased; he seemed suddenly full of confidence. Clearing his throat, he cupped his fists and said, "Let Sect Master Yang know that none of us intend to be his enemies. Our last trip into the Fallen Emperor Mountains was only following orders. Now that Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng are dead and the alliance has suffered enormous losses, one could say its Yuan Qi is gravely wounded. With the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array destroyed the Sacred Alliance's foundation is damaged! Judging by the Sacred Alliance's past ways, even if Sect Master Yang magnanimously spares our lives, there will be no place for people like us — when the wall falls everyone pushes, when the drum breaks ten thousand beat it; it's always been so."

"This has nothing to do with me," Yang Kai sneered.

"I merely say this: if we wish to live, we must find another road — and Sect Master Yang is the best choice!" Liang Yong said solemnly as he looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, grinning. "Not bad. Continue."

Hearing that, Liang Yong's face brightened and he spoke eagerly, "If Sect Master Yang slew us it would be but a lift of the hand. Our lives mean little and bring no benefit to you. But if you spare us, we can bring many benefits to Sect Master Yang."

"For example?" Yang Kai glanced at him sideways.

“Heh heh, now that Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng are both dead, and the Second Elder, Lu Feng, has also fallen, it is only fitting that within the Sacred Alliance, Liang should take the lead.” Liang Yong smiled faintly. “Though I am unworthy, I am willing to manage Battle Sky City on behalf of Sect Master Yang, and deliver all its yearly profits in full! As far as I know, though Sect Master Yang’s Lingxiao Sect resides deep within the Flowing Flame Sandland, and need not fear outside attacks, it does lack various cultivation resources, and trading with the outside world is inconvenient. If Battle Sky City were to supply those needs, then surely Sect Master Yang’s disciples would never again have to worry about cultivation materials. Battle Sky City has been operating for thousands of years, with tens of millions of cultivators making their living here. To speak with some pride, the city’s annual profits are quite considerable — I believe Sect Master Yang will find them satisfactory.”

After speaking Liang Yong fell silent, waiting for Yang Kai's reply.

He was utterly confident he could persuade Yang Kai.

Sure enough, after a moment Yang Kai nodded. "Elder Liang is a fine speaker; this Sect Master is indeed persuaded by you."

As his words fell, the Fire Bird shot back into Yang Kai's body, the Jade-Green Giant Dragon once more reverted to a Dragon Bone sword that Yang Kai sheathed, and even the stone puppet over ten zhang high returned to its original form.

The oppressive atmosphere vanished in an instant.

Liang Yong was overjoyed and prostrated himself, "Thank you, Sect Master, for sparing our lives!"

The others hurriedly pledged their loyalty as well, fearful that a displeased Yang Kai might cut them down.

"From this day forth, there is no more Battle Sky Alliance!" Yang Kai said indifferently. "Battle Sky City is now property of the Lingxiao Sect, and any who violate it shall be my enemies! Liang Yong, your strength is respectable — take the post of City Lord and govern this city for this Sect Master."

"Yes, I will not fail your trust!" Liang Yong replied solemnly.

"Good. I hope you won't disappoint me. Issue the order to have your people stand down; if they don't, they'll likely be wiped out." Yang Kai smiled softly, his face pleasantly genial as if the previous grievances had never occurred. He took out a Transmission Compass, poured a thread of Divine Sense into it, and ordered Ye Xijun and the others to cease.

Fifteen minutes later the inner city of Battle Sky City calmed, though the corpses and blood scattered across the ground were undeniable proof of the fierce battle that had taken place.

In the secret chamber the others had already gone out to pacify the surviving disciples of the Battle Sky Alliance and relay Yang Kai's orders, leaving only Liang Yong and Yang Kai.

"Where are the Alliance's storerooms? Take me to see them," Yang Kai ordered Liang Yong.

"Sect Master, please follow me." Liang Yong dared not refuse and hurried ahead to lead the way.

As a sect that had stood on the Dark Star for thousands, even tens of thousands of years, their amassed wealth was naturally unimaginably vast.

Especially since the Battle Sky Alliance possessed a whole Battle Sky City! The income drawn from within the city each year was already immense.

But now all of that had become Yang Kai's property.

It took two whole days for Yang Kai to organize everything in the Battle Sky Alliance's storerooms and load it all into his Spatial Ring.

Within two days, Liang Yong and the others acted with the swiftness of a sharp blade cutting through tangled hemp, purging all who dared oppose them. They eliminated the loyal followers of Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng, bringing the surviving cultivators of the Battle Sky Alliance firmly under their control.

News of this battle had already spread far and wide. The millions of cultivators who had previously fled Battle Sky City had since returned. Though a colossal power had fallen on Dark Star, it made little difference to them.

The Lingxiao Sect's warship had not damaged the outer city; those people merely needed to bring their goods back and resume business, only now their tributes would go to the Lingxiao Sect instead of the Battle Sky Alliance.

Few could believe the outcome.

The Battle Sky Alliance was simply gone; with a single warship the Lingxiao Sect had broken this colossus apart.

The might of a Void King-Grade warship had shattered people's resolve.

Five days later the black warship slipped out of Battle Sky City and raced toward the horizon. On the city's plaza Liang Yong and the other former high-ranking members of the Battle Sky Alliance respectfully escorted it and secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Though they had sworn fealty and Yang Kai showed no intent to harm them, as long as Yang Kai stayed their hearts would not be at ease — afraid Yang Kai would cross the river and dismantle the bridge. Only when the ship finally left did their hearts settle back into their chests.

Yang Kai left Ge Qi behind in Battle Sky City to serve as Deputy City Lord.

Nominally to assist Liang Yong, but everyone understood the true purpose was surveillance.

Liang Yong had betrayed and ambushed Qu Zheng, groveling to save his life; such a petty and despicable man was naturally one Yang Kai must guard against, lest he hatch some treacherous scheme.

Yang Kai distrusted most who remained, but Ge Qi was different.

Though Ge Qi himself only possessed the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, he had been raised by Ye Xijun and was close to her.

As long as Ye Xijun remained, Liang Yong would not dare touch Ge Qi. Leaving Ge Qi around to occasionally prick Liang Yong's conscience would likely prevent him from entertaining improper thoughts, and the annual tributes would be handed over to the Lingxiao Sect in full, rather than lining his pockets.

When the warship left, not only did Liang Yong and his cohort send it off, but countless martial artists in the outer city cheered, waving at the ship with joyous faces.

The destruction of the Battle Sky Alliance had allowed those routinely exploited and abused to vent their grievances; with Liang Yong's decree to reduce city taxes their spirits were naturally buoyed.

In this, Liang Yong showed some talent — he understood that when Battle Sky City changed hands it was time to win hearts, so he catered to Yang Kai's interests and lavished favors.

Inside the warship, the Origin Returning Realm Elders of the Lingxiao Sect had all shed their usual dignified airs—some wore sly grins, others laughed heartily—as they busied themselves tallying up their gains.

Yang Kai had packed everything from the Battle Sky Alliance's storerooms into his Spatial Ring, intending to bring it back as Lingxiao Sect reserves.

But spoils taken by Chang Qi and the others in slaying enemies were left to them to keep.

Each of those men had slain countless foes; there was no shortage of spoils.

Even Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu sat cross-legged on the ground, rummaging through one Spatial Ring after another to pull out materials they needed and toss aside what they didn't.

Yang Kai smiled wryly; even Ye Xijun stood nearby and chuckled.

"Sect Master, we've lingered in Battle Sky City for five days; the Leitai Sect must have received the news by now, their defenses will likely be more stringent," Ye Xijun suddenly warned.

"Mm." Yang Kai inclined his head. He knew well the value of speed in warfare, but he had been forced to delay in Battle Sky City — such a vast asset he did not wish to abandon. The Lingxiao Sect had few disciples now and did not strictly need so many supplies, but what about the future?

Yang Kai had to plan for the long term.

"No matter. If the Battle Sky Alliance couldn't stop us, the Leitai Sect won't either. No matter how they guard, unless they can break through a warship's defenses, it will be useless."

“Even so, Sect Master should still exercise caution!” Ye Xijun said lightly, leaving it at that. Though she was far older and far more experienced than Yang Kai, the Sect Master of the Lingxiao Sect was still Yang Kai—so in many matters, she would never overstep her bounds.

"Have the disciples increase speed a bit; I hear Lei Feng Canyon is not close from here!" Yang Kai ordered.

Shortly after, the warship, already swift as lightning, raised its speed another notch.

Lei Feng Canyon was thick with Spiritual Qi, nestled among towering mountains and ridges, its area vast.

It served as the Leitai Sect's main headquarters. Unlike the Battle Sky Alliance, which set its main base within a city, the Leitai Sect's seat lay far from populous settlements; with the abundant Spiritual Qi here and nearby peaks for disciples to practice, it was truly a place of outstanding men and fertile ground.
