## Chapter 1681 — Forced Questioning

Kang Feirao could see it too: even without that strange Stone Giant’s assistance, he was absolutely no match for Yang Kai; the young man clearly had not used his full strength!

How could there be such a powerful Origin Returning Realm cultivator? Kang Feirao had thought he’d reached his limit at the Origin Returning Realm, but today he discovered how wrong he had been.

“Tell me about that Sun's True Essence,” Yang Kai’s voice came over. “Why do you say you owe your achievements today to me? I do not recall doing anything for you.”

Kang Feirao glanced at him but did not answer right away. It wasn’t until a wave of destructive aura surged from within the Corpse Pearl that his expression changed. He hastily said, “You inadvertently did! Though perhaps you weren’t even aware of it.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

“Did you think that the Sun’s True Essence was placed there by mere chance? You’re wrong. The reason the Sun’s True Essence existed there is solely to use the Sun’s True Fire within it to suppress an Underworld Spring Source.”

“An Underworld Spring Source?” Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly.

Kang Feirao let out a sinister laugh. “That’s right — it’s a passage connected to the Underworld itself! From there gushes forth a dense tide of Yin Corpse Qi. To any living being, that Yin Corpse Qi is utterly useless, even harmful — but to us of the Corpse Spirit Race, it’s a supreme tonic! With that Yin Corpse Qi, our strength can grow to the very limits of the Origin Returning Realm… hmm, perhaps even beyond!”

Kang Feirao had thought himself standing at the pinnacle of the Origin Returning Realm, but after his bout with Yang Kai he realized how far he still had to go.

“There’s something like that beneath Zangxiong Valley?” Yang Kai frowned slightly.

Kang Feirao laughed loudly. “Do you think the Corpse Den formed by accident? Our Guyang Sect ancestors discovered that Underworld Spring Source long ago, which is why they used the Sun's True Essence to seal it. And the reason we became the noble Corpse Spirit Race is because of the Corpse Qi in the Corpse Den! In the past we had no way to use the Underworld Spring Source, but once you removed the Sun's True Essence everything changed — so tell me, shouldn’t this Protector be thanking you?”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened, his face grim as he said, “So you’re saying Dark Star ended up like this… because of me?”

“Ha ha ha!” Kang Feirao threw back his head and laughed. “Indeed, you bear part of the blame. Tell me… if the people on Dark Star learned this, would they not hate you to the bone?”

“I’ve never been one to bow to threats. If you think waving that around will make me let you go, then you’ve chosen the wrong approach,” Yang Kai said with a cold laugh.

Kang Feirao’s expression flickered several times but he ultimately held back from saying anything that might further enrage Yang Kai.

His Corpse Pearl was now held in Yang Kai’s hand — life and death at another’s command. He would not be foolish enough to push his luck.

“Who is your Sect Master? One of the Corpse Generals I saw that day?” Yang Kai asked again.

Kang Feirao shook his head. “No.”

“Then who is he?”

“I do not know.”

“Nonsense!” Yang Kai snorted. He tightened his grip, and the Corpse Pearl emitted cracking sounds as if it might be crushed at any moment.

Kang Feirao’s body trembled and he ground his teeth with a low howl. “I truly do not know. The Sect Master is not one of our Corpse Spirit Race — he suddenly appeared in the Corpse Den one day, taught us methods of corpse cultivation, and showed us how to transform people into our kind. Without him we could never have left the Corpse Den; we would likely still be cultivating there, for no one had ever walked this path before.”

As Kang Feirao spoke, Yang Kai watched his expressions closely and found no evident tell. There were only two explanations: either Kang Feirao truly did not know the Sect Master’s identity and origin, or his acting had reached such a level that Yang Kai could not detect falsehood.

Yang Kai thought the former was more likely.

“What of his strength?” Yang Kai asked.

Kang Feirao hesitated and then bit his lip. “If I said I do not know his cultivation, would you believe me?”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai stared at him coldly.

Kang Feirao sighed. “But I truly do not know his cultivation! He has never shown himself in combat.”

“Then how did he become the Sect Master of the Corpse Spirit Sect? Don’t tell me you all willingly let him command you just because he taught you a few cultivation methods and a way to convert others.”

“Impossible.” Kang Feirao curled his lip, a flash of annoyance on his face. “The reason we seniors and juniors bowed to him is because he held…”

Kang Feirao did not finish his sentence; his face suddenly twisted as if some utterly terrifying thing had befallen him. His eyes went wide and filled with utter horror, his expression wracked with pain.

A strange, sinister force began to leak out of his body.

Yang Kai’s expression changed, and he hastily pulled back his hand, retreating in a burst of speed.

The next instant, Kang Feirao suddenly let out a wretched, ear-piercing scream. A destructive aura burst forth from within his Corpse Pearl, turning into a mass of eerie green flame that ignited him from the inside out, consuming his entire body in fire.

Green flames spewed from his mouth, nose, eyes, and ears, a ghastly sight.

In less than ten breaths, this once mighty Corpse Spirit—one who had even fought against Ye Xijun and stood at the peak among Corpse Generals—was completely consumed by the green flames, leaving behind nothing but a pile of blackened residue.

Yang Kai watched the whole scene from start to finish and felt a chill rise in his heart.

Yang Kai had no idea what exactly happened to Kang Feirao, but he suspected it was connected to that mysterious Cult Master of the Corpse Spirit Sect. Perhaps the man had placed some powerful restriction on Kang Feirao—one that would instantly trigger if he ever tried to reveal crucial information, exploding his Corpse Pearl and unleashing corpse fire to burn him to death.

Although it was only conjecture, Yang Kai thought it very likely.

Such vicious methods! Such ruthless scheming!

Still, whatever sensitive facts Kang Feirao was about to reveal had triggered the internal curse.

Yang Kai replayed the fragment of words the dying man had spoken; though incomplete, those scraps allowed Yang Kai to deduce something.

That mysterious Sect Master likely possessed some secret treasure capable of controlling the Corpse Spirit Race!

That was the most plausible inference.

Kang Feirao was dead and could never be resurrected; Yang Kai felt a growing wariness toward that mysterious Sect Master.

Whoever could place such a curse on his subordinates was not someone to be trifled with.

As for Kang Feirao’s claim that Dark Star’s state was partly due to Yang Kai — Yang Kai did not deny it. Perhaps his removal of the Sun's True Essence that had sealed the Underworld Spring Source had indeed allowed the Corpse Spirit Race to surge in strength; but the crucial factor was that the mysterious Sect Master passed down the corpse cultivation methods and the means to create Corpse Spirits!

Without the method of transforming Corpse Spirits, the Corpse Spirit Sect could never have grown so powerful.

So Yang Kai only turned the matter over briefly in his mind and did not dwell on it further.

Looking up, a massive Void King-Grade Warship was trampling through the Corpse Spirit Sect’s ranks, each Crystal Cannon volley taking dozens off the field — either Corpse Spirits or enemies who had sided with the sect.

During the few breaths he had spent fighting Kang Feirao, the Flowing Flame Sandland outside had already been filled with corpses and broken limbs.

With a long, resounding roar Yang Kai soared into the sky; his form wavered as Spatial Force wrapped him, and he returned to the warship.

“Return to the sect!” he barked.

After the warship’s purge, the Corpse Spirit Sect’s besieging force around Lingxiao Sect had been reduced by more than half. Even the white-clothed Corpse General Kang Feirao had been slain by Yang Kai; the remainder scattered and fled, leaving little purpose in pursuing them further.

It was more important to return to the sect.

The people from Tongxuan Continent needed to be resettled; after all, they had been living in the Xuan Realm Pearl for several years. Letting them come into contact with this world sooner and become familiar with its heavenly laws would be beneficial.

Yang Kai also wanted to know the current state of Lingxiao Sect; rumors said the sect had suffered heavy losses these two years, and Great Elder Ye Xijun had been grievously injured — he wondered whether she had recovered.

The Three Flames Ring of the Flowing Flame Sandland was overwhelmingly powerful; even an ordinary Void King-Grade Warship would be burned to ash if it attempted to enter.

But Lingxiao Sect’s warship had been personally forged by Yang Yan, and thus bore her imprint; the Three Flames Ring did not resist the ship, and it easily pierced the fiery barrier.

Only after the warship’s vast silhouette vanished did those who had been fleeing feel relief, their faces still pale with lingering terror.

Under the warship’s overwhelming force, they could not even conceive of resistance — they were slaughtered one-sidedly.

Now that the warship had left they relaxed.

Without orders to withdraw none dared leave on their own; before long the Corpse Spirit Sect’s forces reconverged from all directions, preparing to await Kang Feirao’s command.

They had no idea Kang Feirao had already fallen.

Only after an hour passed with no sign of him did suspicion arise, and when they went to the palace to investigate they discovered that the White-Clad Corpse General had in fact died.

A roar of astonishment went up from the crowd.

One of the Four Protectors of the Corpse Spirit Sect was dead and a Void King-Grade Warship of Lingxiao Sect had returned — such omens seemed portentous.

Lingxiao Sect’s mountain gate stood in the Fourth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

But since Yang Yan drew back the first of the Three Flames Ring, there were no longer six layers in the Flowing Flame Sandland — only four remained. Strictly speaking, Lingxiao Sect was in the Second Layer; one layer of the Three Flames Ring enveloped it from outside and another from within, and deeper still lay Yang Yan’s sleeping pavilion.

Passing through the flame barrier, Yang Kai scanned the familiar surroundings and could not help but feel a stir of emotion.

Although the Tongxuan Continent was his homeland, since he had come to the Star Domain he had spent the most time on Dark Star, and Lingxiao Sect also settled there, so he felt a strong sense of attachment to this place.

After all, this was the Sect he had personally founded— the very place where his own Lingxiao Pavilion had flourished and grown strong. The bond of something built and nurtured by his own hands was one that nothing else could ever replace.
