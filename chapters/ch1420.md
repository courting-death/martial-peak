## Chapter 1420 — Some Rejoice, Some Grieve

“Yang Kai!” A shout rang out not far away. Yang Kai looked up and saw Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu staring at him in a daze, occasionally glancing at the warship hovering in midair, as if they wanted to speak but held back.

Although the two were among the top experts on Dark Star, even they were rendered speechless by the shock of the sight.

When had they ever seen a warship of such a high tier — a Void King-Grade vessel?

Yingyue Hall did possess warships, but the best of theirs was only a Lower-Level Origin-Grade craft, forged back when Master Gelin was still alive; it had taken several years, countless artificers from the sect, and vast resources to complete.

Such a warship could be used to search nearby veins and deposits around Dark Star, but to venture deep into the Star Domain would be nothing short of a fantasy.

The dangers that linger within a Star Domain cannot be measured by ordinary means.

Just because Yingyue Hall’s ship was inferior does not mean this Dragon Lair Mountain vessel is. A warship of Void King-Grade already possesses long-range sailing capability; with its power, it might well restore Dark Star’s links to the outside.

At worst, one could board it and leave Dark Star, break free from the shackles of the local Heavenly Dao, and travel to other stars to ascend to the Void King Realm!

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu instantly imagined many possibilities; their hearts surged and their expressions became agitated.

Whether they could reopen a connection between Dark Star and the outside world mattered little to them alone, but both had been trapped at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm for a long time, held back by suppressive Heavenly Dao and unable to advance. To suddenly see such a hope naturally stirred them to the core.

Even if their relationship with Yang Kai was close, neither dared propose such a thing outright. After all, the value of a Void King-Grade warship was immense.

Yang Kai glanced at them and vaguely guessed their thoughts. He smiled faintly and said, “Elder Qian, Lord Fei, please wait a while. My current affairs are a mess; let me settle them first and I will contact you both, all right?”

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu both nodded and replied, “Very well.”

Although Yang Kai made no promises and mentioned nothing concrete, as long as he remained on Dark Star they could contact him again. Moreover, Dragon Lair Mountain had been left in ruins — those little peaks were razed flat by the Crystal Cannon’s might and were clearly no longer fit for habitation. Considering this, Qian Tong spoke up: “Yang Kai, if you have no objections, you may bring those people to live at our Yingyue Hall main hall. What do you say?”

The saying goes that one who is close to the water tower benefits first; though Qian Tong’s proposal had self-interested undertones, it also genuinely offered Yang Kai a place to stand. It was a mutually beneficial suggestion.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly and said in a clear voice, “Elder Qian, I appreciate your kindness, but I already have other lodgings. No need to trouble yourself.”

“Is that so…” A hint of disappointment flitted across Qian Tong’s face, but he did not press the matter. He nodded with easy grace and said, “Fine. Although I do not know where you intend to go, if you already have a place to land, consider my earlier words unsaid. When you have settled, have someone send me word; I will personally come to visit.”

“Certainly, certainly!” Yang Kai returned the gesture with a slight salute.

He then turned to Wei Guchang and Xuan’er to offer his thanks.

This time when Dragon Lair Mountain was besieged, only a handful had helped him — apart from that mysterious woman surnamed Ye, it had been the four from Yingyue Hall who intervened. Yang Kai naturally remembered this debt.

And at this moment, only these people had the courage to remain; the others who were still alive had long since fled. Even Mo Yu of Qiantian Sect, whose attitude had been ambiguous, had vanished.

Click...

A light sound came from midair as the warship’s hatch suddenly opened. Yang Kai glanced over, grinned, and said, “Elder Qian, Lord Fei, I will take my leave first.”

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu inclined their heads slightly and made no attempt to keep him.

Yang Kai shifted and appeared before the Divine Tree, reached out and enveloped it with one hand, and at the same time unleashed a torrent of Divine Sense that poured into and sealed it within the Black Book Space.

Figures shot forward. Led by the woman surnamed Ye, they all leapt through the open hatch and vanished into the warship. Yang Kai followed closely behind. Only after he entered did the hatch swiftly close, and the ship hummed once before transforming into a streak of light and disappearing from view.

“What speed!” Fei Zhi Tu watched the direction the warship had vanished with a face full of shock.

Compared to this, Yingyue Hall’s ship was like a small pot next to a cauldron — not even in the same league.

An inexplicable excitement flickered across Qian Tong’s face and he murmured, “I didn’t expect such talent to come from such a small peak; their foundation is deep. Mo Xiaosheng and the others have provoked someone they shouldn’t have.”

Fei Zhi Tu chuckled, “Why worry about them? What we should consider is how to persuade Yang Kai to use that ship and leave this Dark Star prison. Once you and I reach the Void King Realm, Dark Star will belong to Yingyue Hall.”

At his words, Qian Tong’s expression changed; his eyes sparkled and he nodded repeatedly.

Dozens of li away from Dragon Lair Mountain, Mo Xiaosheng and his party who had fled in disarray all looked up at the direction the warship had vanished and their faces turned ashen. Setting aside the magnitude of their losses, they had now made an enemy of Dragon Lair Mountain. Judging by the foundation that little peak had displayed, the days ahead for the Battle Sky Alliance might be hard indeed.

Mo Xiaosheng’s face was ugly and filled with worry.

The elder of Battle Sky Alliance was like this; Cheng Pengxuan, Jin Shi, and Old Woman Feng were no different. One after another they looked as if they had lost a family member, filled with regret. Especially Jin Shi — in today’s battle he had lost an arm and suffered a grievous wound to his Yuan Qi.

Yet while some rejoiced and others sorrowed, Mo Yu of Qiantian Sect was in high spirits. He bore no ill will toward Dragon Lair Mountain this time; he had even acted once to help Yang Kai resolve part of his crisis. If one was not blind, they could see this as a show of goodwill.

And since his two disciples had some dealings with Yang Kai, he could also take advantage of the opportunity.

What Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu plotted was not lost on Mo Yu; he too had his own thoughts.

With that in mind, Mo Yu slowly said, “Tao’er.”

“Present, Master.” Shen Shitao stepped forward at the call.

“In future, cultivate a closer relationship with that Yang Kai. If you can use your charms to capture his heart and body, that would be all the better.”

“Master…” Shen Shitao blushed deeply. Although her master was normally mild-tempered, he had never spoken such a sensitive matter so plainly before, and his frankness left her flustered.

She already possessed a proud bearing, a mature allure; with her shy mien she became even more captivating, making the male disciples of Qiantian Sect stare with eyes gone wide.

“I am not joking.” Mo Yu’s face was solemn. “If you can become joined to him, you will be Qiantian Sect’s greatest benefactor!”

Shen Shitao was utterly astonished.

Earlier she and Lü Ying and the others had waited outside; though they heard the fierce fighting inside Dragon Lair Mountain, they did not know the exact details. Yet from her master’s words it seemed Yang Kai’s deeds within had earned his utmost praise.

What on earth had happened inside to bring about such a change in her master’s attitude? Shen Shitao knew well how high her master’s standards were. Not long after he had taken her in, an elder within the sect proposed her as a bride for one of his juniors, but her master had rejected the match outright.

That elder’s junior was talented and strong — among the top of his generation. If such a person could not catch her master’s eye, how had Yang Kai impressed him so?

In Shen Shitao’s impression Yang Kai’s strength was indeed remarkable; among those of equal rank he was an expert, but she had always thought his greatest asset was the extraordinary luck he seemed to carry.

Yet her master showed little interest in mere fortune.

Shen Shitao could not make sense of it at all.

Leaving aside the changing thoughts of those outsiders, inside the warship Yang Kai looked around in amazement. A few days earlier, when he had gone with Yang Yan to the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Yan had mentioned that there was a larger vessel stored in Dragon Lair Mountain’s vault, so he was not entirely surprised when this ship appeared.

The only real surprise was that the ship was somewhat small.

Once inside, however, he discovered the vessel had hidden depths. Like the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle, it appeared compact from the outside but was extraordinarily spacious within.

There were exquisite cabins, meditation rooms, an artificer’s workshop, an Alchemy Room, a sparring ground — every facility one could imagine.

This warship was far higher-grade than the enormous craft Yang Kai had traveled on in the past with the Hengluo Commerce Guild!

Continuing forward step by step, Yang Kai soon arrived inside an arched hall. The hall was filled with the calming scent of sandalwood incense, its floor covered by a deep red carpet, and luminous spirit stones set around for lighting, creating an atmosphere of utmost warmth and comfort.

At present, all who held a voice within Dragon Lair Mountain were basically assembled here, including the newly arrived woman surnamed Ye and Ge Qi, who stood by Yang Yan’s side.

Chang Qi, Hao An, and the others wore their usual expressions; after all, they had assisted in the ship’s forging and had entered and exited it many times. As for Qian Yue and Wu Yi, they had long since become Yang Yan’s trusted aides.

Ning Xiangchen, however, remained in a state of stunned disbelief, as if he were in a dream.

He kept sneaking glances at the woman surnamed Ye, meek and deferential in expression.

Ning Xiangchen knew better than anyone present the woman’s lofty background; naturally he felt constrained in her presence. What astonished him most was that this woman surnamed Ye addressed Yang Yan as 'My Lord' — with top-tier cultivation at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, she obeyed Yang Yan implicitly and spoke with reverent respect.

Ning Xiangchen half wished to punch himself to confirm he was not dreaming.

When Yang Kai arrived, Wu Yi and the others wore faces full of grief and kept sighing.

Although Dragon Lair Mountain had been victorious and killed countless enemies without suffering injury, they had lost their home; how could they be happy?

It had been the home they had poured heart and soul into building.

Yet because of a single battle it had been destroyed utterly — years of effort and toil were gone in an instant. Who would not ache at such a loss?
