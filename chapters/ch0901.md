## Chapter 901 — Earth-Splitting Divine Ox

Li Rong's dark brows drew into a single line as she asked softly, "What kind of demonic script is this?"

"Like this..." the Great Lord said, channeling his power into his fingertips and beginning to inscribe on the table in front of him.

After a moment, several intricate and arcane characters appeared on the table, faintly glowing.

Yang Kai looked and found the characters tadpole-like, twisted and contorted, bearing no resemblance to any script he knew; he couldn't help but turn his gaze to Li Rong.

Li Rong stared intently, her expression grave; she nodded and said, "They are indeed demonic script, and very ancient."

"What does it mean?" the Great Lord asked, his face brightening when he saw she seemed to recognize it.

"It's like the placards set before forbidden areas of sects—it's a warning: trespassers will die!"

The Great Lord nodded lightly, feeling the explanation made sense.

"If it's very ancient demonic script, then this should have been a place belonging to demons before—how could it appear in the yao realm?" Yang Kai frowned, puzzled.

The Great Lord smiled and said, "The Demon Domain wasn't limited to the area it occupies now; much of what is today the Yao Realm and your Human Territory long ago belonged to the demons. Only after the Great Demon God fell were the demons gradually forced to abandon vast tracts of land and retreat to the present Demon Domain. It's quite possible this place used to be demon territory."

Yang Kai felt a weight lift from his mind.

"Although I don't know which demonic branch the ruins inside the Void Passage belong to, it's certain that branch must once have been extremely powerful. Whoever carved these characters was among the world's top experts; Old Ox and I both felt a murderous intent radiating from these words—a killing intent that has not faded in countless years!"

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly. "If it's that dangerous, why do you still want to go in?"

The Great Lord answered with a question, "If the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had such a strange place, wouldn't you go and investigate?"

Yang Kai thought for a moment and then nodded, "I would."

Not to plunder whatever mysteries lay within, but at least to confirm the place wouldn't pose a threat to the disciples.

"Exactly. The yao realm isn't that large, and the Void Passage has appeared at the junction of Old Ox's territory and mine. If something goes wrong here we would be forced to abandon the Beast Sea Great Forest and fall back elsewhere, shrinking our living space further," the Great Lord explained, then looked at Li Rong: "So this time I intend to ask the lady to go in with me and take a look—what does the lady think?"

Li Rong pursed her lips and smiled faintly, "You must ask my lord; I cannot give you the answer."

The Great Lord immediately turned his gaze to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai chuckled, "If even you two Great Yao Lords find it troublesome, it's surely not a good place. I'm weak; if I went in I'd likely die a dozen deaths."

The Great Lord rolled his eyes. "I didn't ask you to go; I asked the lady behind you. You can stay at Thundertree Palace—our yao will entertain you. If you get bored, you can return to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land at any time; no one will stop you."

"No way," Yang Kai said with a smile. "Li Rong came out with me, so of course she'll return with me."

"You little—" the Great Lord sighed helplessly, drew a deep breath, and said, "Alright, spit it out: what terms will make you agree? You're the sort who won't let the hawk loose until you see the rabbit!"

Yang Kai shook his head. "Your yao backwater has nothing but a few spiritual herbs and medicines; I don't care for those now."

His mercenary air left the Great Lord helpless; just as he wondered what outrageous demand Yang Kai would make, Yang Kai straightened his face, turned to Li Rong, and asked, "Do you want to go in?"

Li Rong pressed her lips together and said softly, "I will follow my lord's arrangements."

Yang Kai looked at her long and nodded slightly, "Then let's go in."

He could tell Li Rong was very concerned about those ancient demonic characters and did want to enter.

He naturally wouldn't stop her.

"Any conditions?" the Great Lord asked urgently.

"Would you believe me if I said I had no conditions?" Yang Kai replied.

The Great Lord shook his head.

"Fine then." Yang Kai frowned in thought for a moment, then his face brightened and he looked at the stern woman standing behind the Great Lord, Caidie: "Make her smile for me."

Caidie was stunned, and then a chilling coldness flashed in her beautiful eyes as if she wanted to tear Yang Kai apart—her glare was like a blade.

The Great Lord was at a loss for words.

"Ha, just joking—Caidie, don't take it seriously," Yang Kai said, standing up. "If we're going, let's hurry; the sooner we see what's inside, the sooner it's resolved."

Seeing he truly had no further demands, the Great Lord was somewhat surprised and regarded Yang Kai a little more highly.

"Then let's go!" the Great Lord stood, husked him in yao-essence, and flew outward with Yang Kai; Li Rong hurriedly followed, while Caidie lingered, coldly watching Yang Kai's retreating figure before following after some time.

"Kid, don't tease Caidie next time—be careful she doesn't actually turn on you," the Great Lord warned softly as they sped along.

Yang Kai shivered and nodded solemnly, "I won't. I feel a killing intent approaching from behind."

"Serves you right," the Great Lord said with a look of schadenfreude. "Sometimes even I can't handle her—I've never seen her smile."

"You're the one who can put up with this iceberg!" Yang Kai said.

"Still, you're impressive—got your subordinates well in hand," the Great Lord replied, glancing intentionally at Li Rong.

A Second Stage of the Saint Realm expert taking orders from a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm youngster always struck the Great Lord as a little unreal.

"You don't know—it's my personal charm that won them over," Yang Kai said, sticking his tongue out.

"Big talker!" the Great Lord laughed.

After more contact, the Great Lord found Yang Kai's personality the opposite of the Old Saint Lord's. Although he didn't seem very reliable, being around him made the Great Lord feel considerably younger.

Time slowly passed as Yang Kai let the Great Lord fly him along, too lazy to use his own power.

But as they drew closer to their destination, that strange aura in the air grew increasingly obvious.

It was the scent of void power!

It seemed the entire Beast Sea Great Forest had been affected; Yang Kai could hardly imagine how large the Void Passage must be to cause such a widespread disturbance.

They traveled in silence; two or three days later a narrow, elongated rift appeared on the horizon.

When Yang Kai saw the crack his face changed abruptly and he called out, "Could that be the entrance to the Void Passage?"

"Indeed, that's the entrance!"

"That big?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

From this side it was impossible to judge the full length, but Yang Kai estimated the narrow rift was at least a hundred zhang long, as if the sky itself had been torn—terrifying to behold.

Moreover, the rift was extremely unstable; waves of unsettling void energy leaked from it, and the split opened and closed at intervals as if it could collapse at any moment.

About ten li from the void rift a number of yao experts were gathered.

The Great Lord flew straight toward them with Yang Kai.

Sensing the Great Lord's aura, the burly man leading the group stiffened and turned to look.

A moment later, a loud shout rang out: “Lei Long, what took you so long? This Old Ox was dying of impatience waiting!”

The Great Lord smiled slightly. "Finding people takes time; it's only been seven or eight days—what's the hurry?"

As they spoke, the group of four had already descended.

Yang Kai glanced over at the man who had shouted and felt a chill in his heart—this was another Great Yao Lord, the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox.

Like most yao experts, even in human form he retained yao features: two dark-red horns grew at his temples, emitting strong energy fluctuations.

Yang Kai had no doubt those horns were as potent as top Secret Treasures.

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox's attire was far rougher than Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon's; he wore roughly fastened pieces of beast hide, the dark, dense hair on his legs fluttering in the wind, and his speech rolled out like muffled thunder.

"Is this the reinforcement you brought?" Old Ox widened his eyes as he looked between Yang Kai and Li Rong, and nodded faintly, "This woman will do, but who is this fellow?"

He jabbed a thick finger toward Yang Kai with incomprehension, "Not even entered the Saint Realm—what's he doing here, coming to die?"

He looked down on Yang Kai as if a single slap could kill him. Li Rong's expression turned cold and a flash of frost appeared in her eyes as she fixed her gaze on the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox.

Anyone who dared speak to Yang Kai like that would not earn Li Rong's good grace; had it not been for Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon's presence here, Li Rong might very well have fought.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, his face unmoved.

Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon made no move to mediate, only smiling, "He's indeed not in the Saint Realm, but look closely—maybe you'll find something interesting."

"Something interesting?" the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox frowned, stroking his chin, and unceremoniously circled Yang Kai, his cow-like eyes appraising him while his divine sense swept over the youth.

Suddenly his face changed and he stumbled back several paces, shock flooding his eyes; he seemed unable to believe what he perceived.

"You noticed?" Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon chuckled.

"Who is he? How can he possess such pure yao qi?" the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox asked in a low voice.

That yao qi was faint, almost imperceptible, yet extraordinarily pure—purer even than the yao qi on him and Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon.

Such pure yao qi indicated an exceptionally noble bloodline, almost top-tier.

But Yang Kai was clearly human, which left the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox completely bewildered.
