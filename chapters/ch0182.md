## Chapter 182 — The Plight of Hidden Island

As soon as these words were spoken, Ding Jiazi's body was directly crushed in two, thick blood gushing out, his internal organs scattering, his eyes wide open as he fell into the sea.

In an instant, the elders of the Yunxia Sect had met their demise. The remaining martial artists of the Yunxia Sect were left with no will to fight; this powerful demon beast had not yet revealed its full form, yet it displayed such terrifying might. If it were to show its true self, what chance would they have?

The joy of finding Hidden Island vanished in that moment, leaving only a deep-seated fear.

Half of the large ship had already been dragged beneath the water's surface, and the massive tentacles continued to strike the ship relentlessly. Each blow left the vessel in worse condition.

"What should we do?" a martial artist from the Yunxia Sect cried out in despair. He was still young, with a bright future ahead; how could he perish here?

No sooner had he spoken than a tentacle smashed him into a pulp, leaving behind only lofty ambitions.

The scene was as bloody as a purgatory; at that moment, there was almost no difference between martial artists and ordinary people. Under the assault of those massive tentacles, anyone struck was destined for death.

Seeing that even the True Yuan Realmperts were fleeing, they naturally dashed towards Hidden Island, having no time to care about the lives of the disciples.

However, even the True Yuan Realm experts could not escape the attacks of the demon beast lurking beneath the sea.

Flying in mid-air did not guarantee safety; those tentacles seemed to have eyes, accurately targeting the True Yuan Realm experts soaring above. With a single sweep, one would be strangled without mercy.

Yang Kai's expression was grim. He had witnessed everything from beginning to end. From the moment the massive tentacle appeared until now, only ten breaths had passed, and already more than half of the Yunxia Sect's people had suffered casualties, with even more ordinary people dead.

Remaining on the ship was not safe; in a moment, the vessel would be shattered. Even if it weren’t, it would be dragged into the sea.

Jumping into the sea might offer a glimmer of hope! Just a possibility.

Yang Kai was unwilling to sit idly by. He shouted angrily, "Jump off the ship!"

He wasn’t trying to kindly remind others; it was simply that if he jumped alone, he would easily become a target for those tentacles. If everyone jumped together, they could divert the attention of the demon beast lurking beneath the sea.

Sure enough, upon hearing Yang Kai's shout, those panicking individuals seemed to awaken from a dream, hurriedly rushing to the edge of the ship and jumping down without hesitation.

Blood flowers erupted beneath the surface, indicating that those who jumped were not spared from calamity. However, many still managed to swim towards Hidden Island with some luck.

Feeling it was about time, Yang Kai leaped into the water.

The entire sea surface seemed to boil, with dozens of people fleeing in different directions.

As Yang Kai swam, he observed the situation. Soon, he discovered a pattern.

Those who swam quickly seemed to be more easily targeted. The martial artists of the Yunxia Sect all had some agility. Although many could not fly, they naturally swam faster than ordinary people.

Yet, those leading the charge were occasionally swept away by the tentacles extending from the depths, disappearing without a trace, leaving only a few bubbles behind.

Conversely, the ordinary people lagging behind rarely encountered attacks.

Yang Kai did not know how the demon beast beneath the sea determined the positions of these individuals, but since he had noticed this situation, he naturally intended to take advantage of it.

Holding his breath and quieting his presence, Yang Kai suppressed his heartbeat to the limit, moving like a piece of floating duckweed, slowly and steadily approaching Hidden Island.

The tentacles indeed did not seek him out.

Just as he was anxiously waiting, a loud commotion erupted behind him, startling Yang Kai. He turned to see a martial artist from the Yunxia Sect swimming towards him, pale-faced, the noise he made comparable to salt being thrown into hot oil.

Yang Kai cursed inwardly.

The Yunxia Sect martial artist quickly reached Yang Kai's side, not even glancing at him. He grabbed Yang Kai's shoulder, attempting to use him for leverage.

At that moment, a tentacle stretched out from behind them.

Both Yang Kai and the Yunxia Sect martial artist sensed the impending danger. The Yunxia Sect martial artist, quick-witted, exerted force with his hand on Yang Kai's shoulder, trying to throw him towards the tentacle.

But as his primordial energy surged in, Yang Kai merely floated slightly upward before sinking back down.

Instead, Yang Kai swiftly slapped his palm against the martial artist's shoulder, a surge of pure and mighty primordial energy bursting forth, sending him flying backward.

"You..." The Yunxia Sect martial artist was filled with shock and disbelief. Yang Kai was clearly dressed in the attire of the ordinary people on the ship; how could he have expected this ordinary person to suddenly possess the foundation of a martial artist?

Caught off guard, he had no time to react before being flung out of the water.

The tentacle coiled around him, and with a scream, his bones were crushed, shattered bones piercing his internal organs, leading to instant death.

Yang Kai dared not move, vigilantly watching the tentacle in mid-air, his eyes narrowing.

After a moment, the tentacle slowly retracted, sinking into the sea and disappearing from view.

Indeed, the more one moved, the more they would be targeted. It was far more effective to remain still and hold one’s breath, which was the correct way to escape.

After waiting for a while, Yang Kai continued to swim forward.

Hidden Island was not too far from where the ship had encountered trouble, but it wasn't close either—roughly ten li away.

For martial artists who had lived by the sea for a long time, this distance was nothing; even ordinary people could easily swim across.

Of course, this was all under the premise that there were no strange tentacle attacks.

It took a full hour for Yang Kai to leisurely swim to Hidden Island. Upon stepping onto the sandy beach, he collapsed onto the ground, lying flat and gazing at the azure sky, panting heavily with lingering fears.

In that brief hour, who knew how much anxiety he had endured, fearing that a tentacle would suddenly emerge from behind to coil around him or strike him down.

Fortunately, he had found the right method to cope; the tentacles had not attacked him at all.

In the chaos of fleeing, he had no time to pay attention to the movements of others. After catching his breath for a moment, Yang Kai heard a light cough not far away.

It was a woman's voice. Turning to look, he cursed inwardly upon recognizing who it was.

On the beach, about thirty zhang away, Yu Aoqing from the Yunxia Sect was half-kneeling on the ground, drenched, her clothes clinging to her body, accentuating her ample bosom and curvy waist, her long legs appearing enchanting, a sight that provoked the imagination.

She too had just escaped, spitting out seawater, her damp hair draping over her shoulders, her stunning face somewhat pale, looking pitiful.

Yang Kai held no good feelings towards this proud and malicious woman. It was one thing for her to sacrifice her looks to extract information from Miao Lin, but to later toss Miao Lin into the sea was truly heartless.

Although Yang Kai also wished for Miao Lin to die.

Unwilling to have any interaction with her, Yang Kai quietly stood up and walked towards the interior of Hidden Island.

"Stop right there!" Yang Kai did not want to engage with her, but Yu Aoqing had spotted him and called out sharply from behind.

Yang Kai ignored her and continued walking forward.

"I told you to stop! Did you hear me?" Yu Aoqing was furious, quickly scrambling to her feet, her figure flashing as she blocked Yang Kai's path.

Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent.

While he had been cautious and walking on eggshells on the ship, that did not mean he had to be the same here. Yu Aoqing possessed the strength of the Separation and Union Realm, far surpassing Yang Kai's cultivation level, but if it came to a fight, Yang Kai was confident he could escape even if he couldn't defeat her.

Yu Aoqing curiously sized up Yang Kai. She had some impression of this ordinary person who worked on the ship, but she did not expect him to show no fear in facing her, his expression remarkably calm.

He looked young, merely a boy of fifteen or sixteen, yet his courage was commendable! Yu Aoqing scoffed inwardly, channeling her primordial energy to dry her soaked clothes, restoring her previous haughty demeanor. She spoke, "I ask you, have you seen anyone else?"

"No," Yang Kai frowned slightly.

"Not a single person?"

"One."

"Where?"

"You!" 

Yu Aoqing took a deep breath, her chest rising and falling dramatically, nearly bursting free from the confines of her clothing. Coldly, she said, "You better behave, or don't blame me for being rude."

Yang Kai felt displeased by her arrogance, but he did not show it on his face.

He was contemplating whether to shake off this woman and rush into Hidden Island; this was undoubtedly a good opportunity to escape.

But before he could act, a surprised voice called out from the side, "Sister Qing, it's great to see you're okay."

Upon hearing this voice, Yang Kai's expression turned strange. This truly was a case of not being able to avoid one’s enemies; Miao Lin had also made it to the shore nearby, and it seemed he had been on land for some time, currently running over from the palm trees.

Not only Miao Lin, but behind him was another female disciple of the Yunxia Sect.

Three martial artists from the Yunxia Sect were present, and Yang Kai could not handle them all at once, so he gradually retracted his thoughts.

"How come he didn't drown!" Yu Aoqing cursed under her breath, clearly not expecting to encounter this annoying fly after reaching the island.

"The virtuous die young, but scourges linger on for a thousand years," Yang Kai said meaningfully.

Yu Aoqing shot him a cold glare, yet a trace of approval appeared on her lips.

Miao Lin rushed to Yu Aoqing's side, overjoyed, "Sister Qing, it's so good to see you!"

Yu Aoqing nodded indifferently, her gaze shifting to him, she asked, "Is it just the two of you here?"

Miao Lin replied, "Yes, I came up a bit earlier. Besides Sister Zhang Yu, there are no others nearby."

The Yunxia Sect female disciple named Zhang Yu approached as well. With the two groups merging, there were only four of them, one of whom was Yang Kai disguised as an ordinary person, making the situation quite dire.

Yu Aoqing gathered her hair and turned to gaze out at the sea, unable to suppress a sigh.

Yang Kai also glanced over and discovered that, more than ten li away, the large ship had been reduced to splintered wood, the sea surface a deep crimson, with many dismembered limbs and pieces of flesh floating, attracting numerous fish and sharks to feast upon. It resembled a scene from hell.

"Can we go back?" Yu Aoqing murmured softly.
