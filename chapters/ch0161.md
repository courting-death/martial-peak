## Chapter 161 — The Special Nature of Qi Movement Realm

After finishing his words, the Earth Demon hesitated again, “However, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng can only be used by one male and one female. Those two girls are related to the Young Master, so this choice might be a bit troublesome.”

“Two?” Yang Kai was puzzled. He had just heard the Earth Demon refer to “them,” and he initially thought it was a slip of the tongue. Now, upon reflection, he understood.

The Earth Demon probably thought that the girls in question were the Hu sisters. After all, when he was sealed, he had been climbing the endless stairs with Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er.

After being sealed, the Earth Demon could no longer sense the outside world, so he naturally did not know what had happened in the hall afterward.

Not wanting to explain too much, Yang Kai said, “In the future, if I am alone with any woman, you should seal your Divine Sense.”

He was worried that if he became intimate with Su Yan in the future, he might forget about the Earth Demon’s presence, which would be quite awkward.

The Earth Demon hurriedly protested, “Young Master, rest assured, although this old servant is wicked, I would never engage in such voyeuristic acts.”

“Just remember that!”

“This old servant will keep it in mind.”

After a moment of silence, the Earth Demon said, “Young Master, if you don’t mind, this old servant wishes to take a look down in the deep ravine.”

“Oh? What’s down there?” Yang Kai became intrigued. He was also curious about what lay beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine, but his current strength was insufficient to explore it.

“This old servant does not know what lies below, but I can sense an extremely pure Yang aura, which is a nemesis to my soul. In addition, there is a strong presence of demonic energy! These two types of auras are inherently opposed, yet they appear here together for some reason. To be honest, this old servant wishes to use the demonic energy below to restore my soul power, so that I can assist the Young Master in the future.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

He could understand the Earth Demon’s mention of demonic energy. After all, the Dragon Confinement Ravine was created by a formidable demon, and that demon had died beneath it, so the presence of demonic energy was not surprising.

However, the Earth Demon wanting to use this demonic energy to restore his soul made Yang Kai uncertain. He did not know if he could still control the Earth Demon once it became stronger. If he could not control it, it would be like lifting a rock only to drop it on his own foot.

After some thought, Yang Kai felt there was no need to worry too much. His Divine Sense was fused with the Earth Demon, and its life and death were ultimately in his hands.

While the Earth Demon waited anxiously, Yang Kai nodded and said, “Go ahead!”

He infused some Yuan Qi into the Soul-Breaking Spike, allowing the Earth Demon to activate this secret treasure and release it.

“Thank you, Young Master!” The Earth Demon was overwhelmed with gratitude. Wrapping the Soul-Breaking Spike in black mist, it flew down into the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

After the Earth Demon left, Yang Kai took out a small pouch from his pocket.

This pouch belonged to Lan Chudie and contained two seeds of the Chizi Xin. Her face flashed through his mind, causing Yang Kai to frown.

If this beautiful Senior Sister were not so scheming, she would surely be very likable.

He first met her in the Black Wind Trading Market, where he spent some silver to buy her seeds. Later, they encountered each other in the Inheritance Celestial Cave. One could say it was a kind of fate.

They explored and fought together, sharing the bond of being fellow disciples and enduring hardships together. It was indeed an unforgettable memory.

If not for her actions that left a bitter taste, Yang Kai would not have held a grudge against her. In the end, she ambushed Nie Yong. Although she seemed to show goodwill toward Yang Kai, it also revealed her ruthlessness and pragmatism.

When she found him useful, she protected him in every way. Nie Yong had troubled Yang Kai repeatedly, mocking him, yet Lan Chudie never spoke a good word for him, simply because at that time, Nie Yong was more useful than Yang Kai.

If Lan Chudie had reprimanded Nie Yong a few times as a Senior Sister, Nie Yong would not have been so arrogant. But she did not; instead, Du Yishuang always stood by Yang Kai’s side. When Nie Yong became useless, she discarded him like a worn-out shoe and even ambushed him.

Yang Kai would not blame her; everyone has the right to choose their own way of life, and others have no right to interfere. Perhaps she was pragmatic, perhaps she was cold, perhaps she was sycophantic, but that was her choice, her character!

Knowing this, he decided not to get too close to her.

He poured out the two seeds from the pouch and casually tossed the pouch down into the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Where should these two seeds be planted? Yang Kai looked around and found that this place was all stone walls, not suitable for the growth of herbs.

After thinking for a moment, he came up with an idea.

Above his cave abode, at the roots of that ancient pine tree, there was indeed a soft patch of ground. Ordinary ancient pines could take root and grow there, and since Chizi Xin was a spiritual herb, its vitality should be even stronger.

Moreover, this type of spiritual herb absorbed the spiritual energy of heaven and earth for growth, so he need not worry about them competing for nutrients with the ancient pine.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai dripped a drop of Yang Liquid onto one of the Chizi Xin seeds. To his surprise, this seed did not undergo significant changes after absorbing the first drop, unlike before. It was only after he dripped a second drop that it became crystal clear and plump.

This was definitely an Earth-Grade Middle-Level Spirit Herb seed; otherwise, it would not require two drops of Yang Liquid! He wondered where Lan Chudie had obtained this item; buying it for a thousand taels was indeed a good deal.

After planting both seeds, Yang Kai returned to his cave, sitting cross-legged at the entrance, closing his eyes, and slowly operating the True Yang Technique, beginning his first cultivation session after entering the Qi Movement Realm.

Without warning, his Yuan Qi suddenly surged violently, causing Yang Kai’s clothes and hair to fly wildly, and a fierce expression appeared on his face, making him look somewhat menacing.

Accompanying the turbulence of his Yuan Qi, a wave of emotions surged within Yang Kai’s heart—a desire to vent, to fight, to bleed himself or make others bleed.

In the past, such thoughts would only arise when he used the Unyielding Will, but now, they emerged simply from operating the True Yang Technique.

It was not a problem with Yang Kai, nor was it an issue with the True Yang Technique.

It was a characteristic of the Qi Movement Realm!

Just as Su Yan had previously tried to convey to Yang Kai, the Qi Movement Realm is a very special stage for every martial artist.

From Body Tempering to the initial opening of Yuan Qi, reaching the Open Origin Realm, and then breaking through to the Qi Movement Realm, at this point, the accumulation of Yuan Qi within the martial artist’s body has become quite substantial, to the extent that many martial artists cannot fully control it.

Due to this lack of control, the Yuan Qi would become turbulent. When not cultivating or using Yuan Qi, they were no different from others, but once they activated their Yuan Qi, they would exhibit a wild demeanor like Yang Kai did now.

In fact, this was a very normal phenomenon.

Because of this phenomenon, the cultivation of martial artists in the Qi Movement Realm has only two objectives.

One is to continuously accumulate their Yuan Qi, enhance their realm, and increase their strength—this goal remains unchanged from beginning to end.

The second is to control the power they have gained during the accumulation process.

Depending on individual capability, the time it takes for a Qi Movement Realm martial artist to fully control their Yuan Qi varies.

However, generally speaking, when a martial artist reaches the seventh or eighth stage of the Qi Movement Realm, they can achieve complete control. For instance, Lan Chudie, whom Yang Kai had encountered before, was such a case; she did not experience any turbulence when operating her Yuan Qi.

On the other hand, Du Yishuang, Zuo An, and Nie Yong could not manage this. Although Du Yishuang had already reached the sixth stage of the Qi Movement Realm, once she engaged in combat, her gentle temperament would be influenced by the turbulence of her Yuan Qi, turning her bloodthirsty.

The peculiarity of the Qi Movement Realm leads to martial artists at this stage easily clashing with others; everyone’s temper is not very good, and no one is willing to back down. Once opinions differ or they find each other displeasing, fights break out, resulting in bloodshed and casualties being quite common.

This is the realm with the highest mortality rate for martial artists!

In response to this situation, many martial artists in the Qi Movement Realm will seek ways to stabilize their minds, whether by taking pills or wearing treasures that calm the mind, all of which can effectively suppress their impulses and fury.

At this time, martial artists who have cultivated cold attribute martial techniques and methods have a distinct advantage, as their Yuan Qi is cold due to their techniques, making it easier to suppress changes in their temperament, thus safely passing through this stage.

Yang Kai speculated that Su Yan, when in the Qi Movement Realm, would not have to worry about such issues at all.

Her body and mind were already frozen; how could her Yuan Qi become turbulent?

Throughout the Qi Movement Realm, martial artists are not only enhancing themselves but also battling against the turbulence of their own Yuan Qi. If successful, they gain control over their power without letting it affect their temperament; if they fail, they become lost in the thrill of their power surging, gradually losing their true nature.

Most of the evil and demonic beings arise in this manner. They become lost in their own power, reveling in the pleasure of bloodshed and killing, thus falling into the path of evil.

Above the Qi Movement Realm, due to the polarization of martial artists’ temperaments, it is called the Separation and Union Realm!

However, this realm is still somewhat distant for Yang Kai.

At this moment, after operating the True Yang Technique, the signs of the Qi Movement Realm had already appeared within Yang Kai’s body, but the temperament influenced by the Yuan Qi returned to normal in an instant.

A cool sensation emanated from his chest; it was the effect of the Ice Jade Essence that Su Yan had given him.

It was not that the Ice Jade Essence had calmed him down; rather, he had not been affected by the Yuan Qi at all.

After trying for a while, Yang Kai found nothing amiss. His thoughts reached where he wanted, and the Yuan Qi within him was as flexible as an extension of his arm, showing no signs of being uncontrollable.

This was a strange phenomenon; his current Qi Movement Realm was merely exhibiting the same external signs as other martial artists, yet internally, it was vastly different.

While others had to strive to control the power they had gained, Yang Kai did not need to, as the Yuan Qi had always been under his control, showing no signs of restlessness.

After pondering for a long time, Yang Kai felt that all of this was related to his adaptation to the Unyielding Will. When using the Unyielding Will, he would feel bloodthirsty excitement, yet his heart remained calm, knowing what he was doing and how to do it, without letting the bloodthirsty excitement affect his judgment.

This was a good thing; Yang Kai had essentially completed one of the two tasks that a Qi Movement Realm martial artist needed to undergo. All that remained was to accumulate strength.
