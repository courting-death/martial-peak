## Chapter 1904 — Add Some Stakes

"Who are you to speak ill of my grandpa!" Zuo Ling suddenly cried out; she raised her hand and a fire-dragon-like attack burst from her palm, charging straight at Yang Kai.

Emotionally stung and already in a bad mood, she had heard Yang Kai openly accuse Zuo De and couldn't help herself — she wanted to use Yang Kai as an outlet to vent her grievances.

So she struck without hesitation.

Zuo Ling, as Zuo De's legitimate granddaughter, had decent innate talent, and with the large supply of Spiritual Pills provided by Zuo De, though young she already possessed cultivation at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

The move she casually unleashed carried considerable power; the fire dragon roared, the air grew scorching, and it opened its gaping maw to bite Yang Kai.

"Ling'er, stop!" Zuo De shouted in alarm. Zuo Ling was young and impulsive and did not know Yang Kai's depth, but he had learned from Zhan Yuan that Yang Kai was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert; in any case Zuo Ling could not possibly be his match.

If the other party grew angry and harmed Zuo Ling, it would be a heavy loss.

But his shout came a little late; by the time his words fell, the fire dragon had already roared up to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's expression did not change, he did not even move his body; leisurely he extended a hand, spread his five fingers, and reached to grab at the fire dragon. The fire element scattered into the void and the heated air returned to normal.

Zuo Ling stood dumbfounded — she clearly had not expected her strike to be so easily neutralized, and she realized Yang Kai's strength far exceeded her own.

But she was not afraid; instead she grit her teeth and cried, "Grandpa, he bullied me, you teach him a lesson!"

As she spoke she kept shaking Zuo De's arm. Zuo De's aged body rocked like a lone boat in a storm, swaying left and right.

She believed Zuo De to be omnipotent because the Void King Realm experts treated him with such deference. Thus when she suffered a slight loss she expected Zuo De to stand up for her.

But Zuo De did not have that ability; those Void King Realm experts respected him for his pill-refining skill, not his cultivation. He was but a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior. Using force to teach Yang Kai would be suicide.

Yang Kai could not help but snort.

After all, he was now a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert; Zuo Ling's wanton attack could easily be punished by him, yet to fuss over such a little girl would make him seem petty. Unexpectedly, seeing Zuo De delay, Zuo Ling shouted to Ai Ou, "Uncle Ai Ou, kill him! Kill him. I'll have Grandpa refine that Taichu something pill for you!"

At those words Yang Kai's face darkened.

Ai Ou's expression also turned odd.

Being richly doted on, the little girl could be willful and perverse — that could be understood — but to casually demand someone's life out of displeasure was excessive. Moreover, she herself had stirred this up; the responsibility did not lie with Yang Kai. Anyone with sense would not agree with Zuo Ling's words, nor would they offend a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert.

"Uncle Ai Ou, you asked Grandpa here to refine that pill, didn't you? You're so powerful; he's certainly no match for you. Kill him," Zuo Ling cried, pointing at Yang Kai and urging Ai Ou as if ordering a subordinate, domineering.

"Er..." Ai Ou gave an awkward chuckle and said, "Ling'er, Uncle might not necessarily be a match for him."

"How could that be? You're the chairman of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, one of the most powerful people around — how could you not be his match? Oh, I see. You just don't want that Spiritual Pill anymore."

"Ling'er, stop fooling around!" Zuo De could not bear it and admonished sharply.

Zuo Ling's mouth fell into a pout. Seeing her grandfather truly angry, she sensibly stopped her tantrum, but the look she gave Yang Kai was full of hatred; her teeth ground together as if she wanted to leap forward and bite into him.

"Xue Yue, you were right not to accept this marriage," Yang Kai said with a light smile, "to take such a woman as a wife, how would you live your days?"

Xue Yue glared at Yang Kai and said nothing.

Zuo De glowered at Yang Kai, his face grim. "You have provoked me time and again — what do you intend by it?"

"Heh heh, the same as before — I will speak plainly," Yang Kai smiled calmly.

"Ling'er is indeed a bit spoiled by my doting, but her nature is still good; you have no right to judge her so!" Zuo De snapped.

"So casually taking a life is 'good nature'? If I weren't a Second Stage of the Void King Realm but a Saint King, you'd probably already have my corpse by now, correct?" Yang Kai sneered.

"If you were a Saint King Realm, you wouldn't even qualify to speak to me!" Zuo De retorted.

"Then too bad I'm not!"

Zhan Yuan could not help but interject, "Enough! You speak to my master with such disrespect — have you forgotten who refined the pills you've used these years? Any martial artist with gratitude would not treat a respected pill master this way!"

"Remember the source of the water you drink and repay your debts of gratitude!" Yang Kai nodded faintly. "Is that what you mean? Sorry — as I told you before, I'm an alchemist too. The Spiritual Pills I've taken over the years were all refined by my own hand. They say fellows in the same trade are natural rivals, so I owe no special gratitude to any other alchemist." 

Zuo De's eyes flashed with a glint, showing disbelief.

"Indeed!" Yang Kai confirmed.

Zuo De sneered, "Oh? Dare I ask what rank of alchemist you are? Do you possess an alchemist badge?"

"I do not have that thing, and I won't say what rank I am."

Zhan Yuan scoffed from the side, "Master, why bother with someone like this? His Martial Dao cultivation is decent, but he is young; even if he is an alchemist he is not worth comparing to you. You stand at the very pinnacle of the Star Domain."

Zuo De smiled arrogantly, his gaze toward Yang Kai laced with contempt.

"The very pinnacle? Not necessarily," Yang Kai said with a light laugh. "Void King-Grade alchemists may be few, but I know one younger than you who will certainly surpass you in the future."

He was naturally referring to Xia Ningshang.

"What nonsense!" Zuo De barked angrily. "I have reached the pinnacle of the Lower-Level of Void King-Grade, and I can breakthrough to Middle-Level at any time. In this entire Star Domain, who could possibly outstrip me!"

Speaking of his mastered domain, Zuo De's imposing aura became aggressive; he would not admit defeat.

"You do not believe me?" Yang Kai smiled at him.

"Bring that person here and I will contest him; make him admit defeat with conviction!" Zuo De snorted coldly.

"That person is billions of li away and cannot be summoned in an instant. But if the master wishes to contest... how about I, Yang, contest you? I consider my skill in alchemy perhaps slightly inferior to that person's; if you can beat me, I will admit what you said earlier. But if you can't beat me, hehe..."

Everyone on the hall steps stared at Yang Kai in stunned silence, as if they had seen something unbelievable.

Zong Ao's mouth hung open wide enough to fit a fist.

Ai Ou's expression flickered; many thoughts raced through his mind, and suddenly he seemed to understand Yang Kai's intention — his eyes flashed with light and he felt deep gratitude.

In any case, Yang Kai appeared to be a very fine fellow, worth befriending!

"What? What did you just say?" Zuo De looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, doubting his own ears.

"Master seems rather aged," Yang Kai sighed. "As I said just now, master could compete in alchemy with me."

"You would contest me in alchemy?" Zuo De laughed scornfully. "I cannot see where your confidence comes from."

"No need for master to worry; just say whether you dare."

"Hmph, do you think I don't see your scheme? If I agree to contest you, are you proposing we refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill?" Zuo De sneered.

"Ah, master is wise — that is indeed my proposal," Yang Kai replied in surprise.

Everyone's thoughts turned and they immediately understood what Yang Kai intended.

If Zuo De, unable to restrain his anger, agreed to contest in alchemy and Yang Kai stipulated the contest be to refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, then Zuo De would undoubtedly throw himself into winning and would strive to refine it successfully.

That would resolve Gu Bihu's crisis and ease Chairman Ai Ou's urgent concern.

Whether Yang Kai himself could refine it — who cared.

Losing an alchemy contest to a Void King-Grade alchemist was not something to be ashamed of.

It was losing a duel in martial combat that would be humiliating.

"Trickery — I will not be fooled!" Zuo De snorted coldly, looking at Yang Kai with contempt as if he had seen through him.

"Master, you wrong me," Yang Kai smiled slightly. "To make the contest fairer, how about I add some stakes?"

"What stakes?" Zuo De asked coldly.

"If I lose, I'll serve as your bodyguard for a thousand years!" Yang Kai said solemnly.

"What?" At those words everyone was stunned, staring at Yang Kai as if he were a fool; even Zuo De looked tempted.

Though he was a Void King-Grade alchemist with many followers, none of his subordinates were actually of Void King Realm cultivation.

Void King Realm practitioners were proud; when seeking pills they might be polite, but they would not allow themselves to be dominated and enslaved.

Moreover Yang Kai was not an ordinary Void King Realm practitioner — he was at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm!

Across the entire Star Domain, there were not many like him.
