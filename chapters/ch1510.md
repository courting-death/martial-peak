## Chapter 1510 — The Entire City in an Uproar

“Brother Chu, you asked the wrong person; like you, I am merely a low-ranking law enforcer. How could I possibly know what you do not?” the other middle-aged elder on the right slowly shook his head and replied with a smile.

The short-haired burly man let out a chuckle. “Brother Huang, you flatter yourself. Though we are both law enforcers, you are not like me—you didn't join midway. I've long heard that you have some connection with Great Elder Mo. Surely you must have heard something about this incident?”

The middle-aged elder heard that and laughed haughtily. “Although I have some ties with Great Elder Mo, they are merely distant blood relations. If it were a close relationship, I would already be serving as a Deacon in the inner city. Why would I come out to the outer city to be a law enforcer, dealing with these petty merchants and handling trivial matters every day?”

“That may be so, but Brother Huang still has every chance to remain in the inner city. With your aptitude, if you stayed there, you could surely advance two Stages within three to five years. I envy you greatly. If that day ever comes, do not forget me—give me a little assistance.”

“Of course that's not a problem. Our friendship spans decades—would I give you anything less?” the middle-aged elder laughed loudly, his mood clearly pleased. He glanced around and, seeing no one paying attention, straightened his expression and lowered his voice. “Brother Chu, although I don't know the full details of what happened in the Alliance, I recently asked Great Elder about his wellbeing and overheard him discussing matters with the Alliance Master. It seems related to that brat called Yang Kai.”

“Yang Kai?” The short-haired man frowned, feeling that the name sounded somewhat familiar. After a moment's thought his face changed in alarm. “Could it be the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect?”

“Yes. It is indeed the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect!” the middle-aged elder nodded slightly.

“Just a brat,” the short-haired man scoffed. “Why would the Alliance Master and Great Elder be discussing him? Could this matter really have anything to do with him?”

“Hmm. It seems that the last time the Alliance Master and Great Elder went out with people, it was to deal with him. Unfortunately that brat is as sly as a fox and escaped. Before leaving he even vowed vengeance against our Battle Sky Alliance.”

“He doesn't know his place!” the short-haired man sneered. “He's only a junior—how dare he say such things. He truly doesn't know how to live.”

“I hold the same view,” the middle-aged elder agreed.

“But…even if he vows revenge, why are the Alliance Master and Great Elder so nervous, making such a fuss? Is our Battle Sky Alliance really afraid of him?”

“Do not take him lightly, Brother Chu!” the middle-aged elder's expression grew serious. “That brat isn't without talent. He's only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, about equal to you or me. For someone so young to possess this cultivation is rare—his potential is not bad. But in a fight either of us could kill him with ease. Yet don't forget—Lingxiao Sect has a Void King-Grade Warship!”

At this the short-haired man straightened and nodded. “I've heard of that too. They say Lingxiao Sect does indeed have such a warship, but whether it's true—no one can confirm it. But even if they have a Void King-Grade Warship, so what? Battle Sky City won't be cowed. If he dares bring the warship here, he'll be like striking a rock with an egg—our tens of thousands of elite warriors in the Alliance would make sure he returns no more!”

“Ha, Brother Chu speaks sensibly. It's only one warship, and I hear it's merely a small one—no great matter. The Alliance Master and Great Elder are being overly cautious,” the middle-aged elder laughed dismissively.

As they laughed the sound suddenly died away.

“What's wrong?” the short-haired man asked, puzzled as he looked at his companion.

The middle-aged elder did not answer. Instead he stared intently at the distant horizon. After a long while he pointed and asked, “Brother Chu, look over there—don't you see something approaching?”

“Do I?” The short-haired man followed his finger and indeed noticed a small dark speck rapidly approaching the Battle Sky Alliance.

The speck had seemed insignificant from afar; the distance was too great to discern what it was.

Yet quickly a vague outline came into view.

It turned out to be a long shuttle-shaped warship, jet-black and unfathomably deep.

In the blink of an eye the warship had come within fifty li of Battle Sky City, and the next instant it hovered outside the city.

“A warship!” the short-haired man and the middle-aged elder exclaimed in unison.

A disquieting wave of energy rolled out from the warship. Though its size was not great—only a dozen zhang in length—beside that black warship both felt as if they faced an impassable towering peak, an inexplicable dread gripping their hearts.

“Void King-Grade Warship!” the short-haired man cried out again. “Could it be—”

They had just been talking about Lingxiao Sect's supposed Void King-Grade Warship; could this warship be that very vessel? After all, the Dark Star had always been constrained in forging techniques; such Void King-Grade warships had never appeared here. Not to mention Void King-Grade vessels, even Origin-Grade middle-level warships had not been seen.

There was only one explanation.

Lingxiao Sect had truly brought a warship to attack.

A warship only some dozen zhang long was the smallest class, hovering above Battle Sky City. Compared to the vast city it was like clouds and mud, but its arrival had shaken the entire city.

Countless gazes fixed upon the warship; people craned their necks, wondering what purpose the vessel served by coming here.

The answer revealed itself the next moment.

A dazzling light suddenly flashed from the warship, growing brighter until it was as blinding as the sun.

With the light's intensification came a terrifying energy fluctuation.

“Crystal Cannon!” the short-haired man and the middle-aged elder stared dumbstruck. Under that immense pressure they felt numb and could not move; their Saint Yuan failed to circulate properly.

They could sense how enormous the Crystal Cannon's power was—such an attack would obliterate them outright even if it only grazed them.

Yet no one had ever used a warship to attack another sect's main headquarters before.

Warships on the Dark Star were at best Origin-Grade lower-level—such vessels lacked strong defenses and were massive. Using a warship in sect combat would only make it a living target; it would be hard to wield effectively and would soon be destroyed.

But today, the millions of warriors within Battle Sky City witnessed the inconceivable.

A warship had indeed come to hover outside the city and had even activated its Crystal Cannon, seemingly intending harm to Battle Sky City.

While everyone stood stupefied, a bright beam shot out silently from the warship, obliterating everything in its path—reducing buildings to dust and even tearing a visible scar through the void.

Rumbling filled the air…

Moments later sounds echoed from within Battle Sky City: the Crystal Cannon's path had been cleared of all obstacles; the savage energy remained chaotic, as if the laws of heaven and earth could not repair the damage in short order.

There were no casualties; the single Crystal Cannon strike had destroyed many structures in Battle Sky City—an obvious show of force.

“Bad—hurry to the inner city and report to the elders!” The two men felt a chill through their bodies and barked orders, no longer daring to linger, and both guided their Star Shuttles toward the inner city.

The two had boasted grandly earlier, but faced with a powerful enemy they could only flee.

No reminder was necessary: once the Crystal Cannon fired, Battle Sky City erupted into chaos. Countless people spread the alarm, panic-stricken; some stamped their feet and cursed in anger.

A clear, feminine command echoed from where the warship hovered. It was not loud, but every person heard it distinctly.

“I am Ye Xijun, serving as Great Elder of Lingxiao Sect. By the Sect Master's order I announce to everyone within Battle Sky City that our Lingxiao Sect has long maintained a humble accord and did not seek conflict, yet the Battle Sky Alliance has greatly provoked us and sought to harm our sect. We come today to settle the grievances with the Battle Sky Alliance. We do not wish to harm innocents; those unrelated to this matter must evacuate Battle Sky City within a quarter hour. After a quarter hour our sect will launch an attack on the Battle Sky Alliance. Those who remain will be regarded as our enemies and shall be killed without mercy!”

At her words the entire city erupted in an uproar.

Who was Ye Xijun? Few had heard of her. Apart from some elderly Origin Returning Realm practitioners who understood her might, most people had never heard her name.

But regardless of who she was, the fact she pledged to attack the Battle Sky Alliance was enough to stagger people's minds.

Is the Battle Sky Alliance easy to provoke? Bringing a small warship to attack the massive Battle Sky City—are the people of Lingxiao Sect all fools, or simply reckless?

Such conduct made the sect a laughingstock.

Most believed Lingxiao Sect was overestimating itself.

Yet those in the know, aware of Lingxiao Sect's hidden depths and the warship's ferocity, hesitated and did not linger; they hurriedly packed and began evacuating.

No matter what grudge exists between the Lingxiao Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance, and regardless of who wins or loses this battle, once the fighting starts, the fire at the city gate will surely spread to the fish in the moat. If they didn’t leave now, they might very well be dragged into the conflict.

For a time Battle Sky City descended into chaos as many warriors rushed outward.

But most people chose to stay—packing up could not be done in an instant. Many ran shops within the city and had vast supplies; they could not simply leave.

They also knew the Battle Sky Alliance would not sit idly by and preferred to observe.

If Lingxiao Sect proved all show and no substance, there was no need to worry; if it truly could contend with the Alliance, one could still leave later.

The Battle Sky Alliance did not remain idle. Offended by Lingxiao Sect's provocation at their doorstep, the Alliance could not be seen as impotent without showing some response.

Immediately a dozen light beams shot from the inner city and quickly arrived at the outer city, stopping a hundred zhang from the warship.
