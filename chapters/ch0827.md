## Chapter 827 — Knowing the Times

Wu Jie wore a calm, untroubled expression; in this moment he actually seemed quite candid and aboveboard.

After a long beat, Yang Kai reined in his hostility and snorted lightly. “If you’re not here to fight, what are you doing in front of me?”

“Naturally, to discuss something.” Seeing Yang Kai’s attitude ease, Wu Jie relaxed as well and chuckled.

Yang Kai frowned in surprise. “You’ve got to be kidding. You and I are mortal enemies—what do we have to discuss?”

“I never said I was your mortal enemy,  Saint Lord. That’s just your take on it, isn’t it?”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai looked at him coolly.

“I mean, I’m willing to turn swords to silk with you, Saint Lord. What do you say?”

“You may be willing—I’m not.” Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “You’ve chased me all these days and made trouble for me before. You think a few words erase that grudge? Aren’t you a bit naive?”

Wu Jie pulled a helpless face. “I was forced into it… Zhang Ao and Cao Guan joined hands to pressure me—I had to go through the motions. When we attacked Nine Heavens Sacred Land, my Netherworld Sect hardly entered at all, and we barely struck. In fact, many of mine were killed by the yao.”

“Serves you right,” Yang Kai said with a cold huff. Still, Wu Jie wasn’t lying—he hadn’t seen much action from Netherworld Sect in that battle.

“Heh…” Wu Jie gave an awkward laugh. “I know you likely don’t believe me, Saint Lord. But how to put it… my Netherworld Sect’s creed is taking money to dispel disasters for others. I took quite a lot from Zhang Ao and Cao Guan, so I had to act with them. But now—I don’t want to anymore.”

“Why?” Yang Kai’s stare bored into him.

“Because I think you’re someone who’ll accomplish great things, Saint Lord. Zhang Ao and Cao Guan believe that as long as they seize you, they can gain Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s inheritance and see hope to break through to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm. I can only say they’ve let power blind their minds.”

“And you don’t see it that way?” Yang Kai looked at Wu Jie with interest.

Wu Jie shook his head soberly. “If the Third Stage of the Saint Realm were so easy to reach, then Nine Heavens Sacred Land wouldn’t have only one Saint Lord at that realm—you’d have long since been unrivaled. I don’t know the secrets your inheritance hides, but I do know there’s no such thing as a free lunch. In your Sacred Land, every Saint Lord is short‑lived, and each generation has only one who reaches the Third Stage of the Saint Realm. So though the inheritance is powerful, it has many limits. Even if they catch you and get the inheritance, it doesn’t mean they’ll succeed. Failure is very likely.”

“You do see clearer than they do.” Yang Kai couldn’t help giving Wu Jie a second look. The man’s black robes and green miasma made him look like a specter, but his mind was sharp.

“You flatter me, Saint Lord,” Wu Jie said with a respectful cupped‑fist salute, his manner mild. “Exactly because of that, I don’t want to be your enemy. And you’ve proven your strength—no Transcendent Realm cultivator has ever kept ahead of three Saints for so many days. If Zhang Ao weren’t at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, we’d have lost you long ago. At this rate, we could chase until the end of time and still not catch you.”

“Yet here you are, stopping me,” Yang Kai said, face cooling; he couldn’t help but be wary of Wu Jie’s ghostly methods.

“At great cost,” Wu Jie said with a bitter smile and shake of the head. “To be frank, when I was young I had a stroke of fortune and gained certain unknown methods—I can tear space and cross a thousand Li in an instant.”

“Tear space?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

“Mm. But doing so makes it easy to get lost in spatial rifts and never find a way out. If I could have caught you otherwise, I’d never have used such a risky method. Since the day I got it, I’ve used it only twice, each time at tremendous risk.”

Wu Jie seemed quite sincere, laying his methods bare to Yang Kai without a hint of concealment.

“Interested, Saint Lord?” Wu Jie asked with a smiling squint. “If you are, I can offer it up with both hands.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted; his eyes flashed.

He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t interested in a method that tore space and crossed a thousand Li—but Wu Jie’s attitude was curious.

“What do you actually want?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

“No need to overthink it. I truly want nothing. I came only to state my stance… My Netherworld Sect is willing to be on good terms with you, Saint Lord, for generations to come. What do you think?”

Yang Kai stared at him coldly, catching the key point: he said he’d befriend Yang Kai—not Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Clearly, to him, Yang Kai was more worth befriending than Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

“What’s in it for me?” Yang Kai’s manner eased. He could tell Wu Jie wasn’t lying—his Spirit Body’s aura was steady.

“The method I mentioned—don’t you want it?” Wu Jie smiled serenely. “I have no special talent beyond knowing the times. That’s how Netherworld Sect has endured. Your realm is below mine for now, Saint Lord, but I believe that in a few decades you’ll stand above all. I’d rather not be settled with then, my sect wiped out. Besides… I have a feeling that even now, if we fought, I might not win.”

“You certainly do know the times,” Yang Kai said, the corner of his mouth quirking into a wicked smile.

He suddenly found Wu Jie rather interesting. He might be a petty man, but he was an honest petty man—and keen‑eyed. Inside the Court of Divine Battle, Yang Kai had no fear of him.

“In the past, Netherworld Sect lived under your old Saint Lord’s protection. I hope we can be under yours as well. I don’t ask much—only that Netherworld Sect can endure.”

“I agree,” Yang Kai said with a sober nod.

“My thanks,” Wu Jie said gravely, cupping his fists again.

“You’ll be glad you made this wise choice,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Then Zhang Ao and Cao Guan are likely in for it…” Wu Jie said meaningfully. He met Yang Kai’s eyes, then laughed.

After a while, his face turned solemn. He flicked his finger, and a bead of pearly light shot straight toward Yang Kai. “This contains the process and memories of the fortune I gained back then. Probe it and you’ll know I’m not lying.”

“Then I won’t be polite,” Yang Kai said, and merged the light into his Spirit Body.

“That method is formidable and startling, but let me advise you—never use it unless absolutely necessary. It’s all too easy to lose yourself in the spatial rifts. The first time I used it…” He shuddered at the memory, as if recalling something terrifying, and trailed off. “In any case—be cautious.”

“I’ll remember,” Yang Kai nodded, not yet delving into the information he’d received.

“One more thing. I estimate Zhang Ao and Cao Guan won’t give up on you anytime soon, so I’ll have to keep chasing with them for a bit. I don’t think you’ll mind—after all, they can’t catch you.”

“Doesn’t matter,” Yang Kai said with a nod.

“Then I’ll take my leave.” With Yang Kai’s promise in hand, Wu Jie looked well satisfied.

Yang Kai waved a hand and dispelled the Court of Divine Battle. In the next instant, their Spirit Bodies returned to their shells.

Wu Jie nodded to Yang Kai and was about to turn and go when he suddenly frowned. “By the way, have you ever met the Coffin‑Bearer?”

At that, Yang Kai’s face cooled, his aura turning sharp.

Wu Jie started. “Don’t be so jumpy. I just asked.”

“Why ask that?”

“Because the other day I overheard Cao Guan and one of his men, a cultivator named Yao Di, mention the Coffin‑Bearer—and they mentioned you. So I wondered if you’d encountered him.”

“Yao Di?” Yang Kai frowned, suddenly recalling the man he’d met outside Blazing Fire City. He asked quickly, “What else did they say?”

Wu Jie shook his head. “I didn’t catch it. They spoke very covertly.”

As if to himself, he added, “Rumor has it the Coffin‑Bearer’s hiding place holds a heaven‑defying treasure. Whoever unlocks his secret can command the strength to dominate a region… Who knows if that’s true. Heh. Don’t mind me. I’m only passing it along. Farewell.”

With that, he swept away without a care.

Watching his back vanish, Yang Kai’s brows drew together.

As the saying goes, there’s no windless hole. Though the rumors about the Coffin‑Bearer weren’t entirely true, they weren’t entirely false either.

Behind the Coffin‑Bearer did lie a power that could let one dominate a region—but not a power just anyone could claim.

Wu Jie had brought it up as if idly, clearly warning him to be careful not to expose his connection to the Coffin‑Bearer.

The man’s mind ran deep—and he was willing to pay a price.

Just because he believed in Yang Kai’s future, he’d given up being an enemy. In a sense, he had a far‑sighted streak.

Yang Kai gave his head a shake and stopped thinking about it, then turned and flew toward one direction.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan still dogged his heels. With Zhang Ao at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, Yang Kai couldn’t hide his aura from his Divine Sense probes.

A month flashed by. Only then did Yang Kai faintly feel he had shaken them off.

After such a long chase, he wasn’t the only one depressed—Zhang Ao and the others were likely fed up and out of patience.

He circled the area for a few more days. After confirming there was no sign of Zhang Ao and company, Yang Kai finally let out a quiet breath.

He wasn’t worried about them catching him, but being in that situation all the time was deeply unpleasant.

Ahead, verdant mountains rose and fell, and the Spiritual Qi was rich. Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense out to survey the surroundings. Aside from the occasional traces of Demonic Beasts, he sensed no people.

His spirits lifted, and he flew straight toward those peaks.
