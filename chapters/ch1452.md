## Chapter 1452 — Distribution

The young woman from Ice Heart Valley no longer pressed the matter; after all, even if Yang Kai was an alchemist, he wasn't from Chilan Star, so it concerned her little. Instead, she stared at the Grand Harmonizing True Yuan Pill with bright eyes and said, "If what you say is true, young Brother, then this single pill is a Void King-Grade Middle-Level Pill? If one cultivates with it, would a day of use equal two days of ordinary arduous training?"

"Three days," Yang Kai replied. "After all, this pill bears pill patterns; its medicinal effect is stronger than an ordinary Grand Harmonizing True Yuan Pill."

The young woman's eyes lit up in delighted surprise. Pills that could accelerate cultivation speed were extremely rare. The reputation of the Grand Harmonizing True Yuan Pill was well-known throughout the Star Domain, but very few ever obtained one. Swallowing such a pill could keep its effect for at least half a year; secluded cultivation for half a year would be equivalent to others' year-or-two of painstaking practice. The temptation was immense. Unfortunately, in this jar there was only one useful pill; the rest were all, like the previous jar, ruined.

While she fancied such prospects, Yang Kai had already placed that single Grand Harmonizing True Yuan Pill to one side.

"Let's look at the rest." With a good start, the young woman's spirits immediately rose; she casually picked up another jade vial and emptied its pills out.

Almost a hundred vials of pills — checking them didn't take much effort; in all it was barely half an hour. Yang Kai and the young woman had already separated out all the usable spiritual pills, tossing the ruined ones aside.

Grand Harmonizing True Yuan Pill, Dragon Essence Pill, Bamboo-Born Pill, Soul-Nurturing Pill, Condensing Jade Pill...

The pills here varied in grade and purpose: healing, cultivation, breaking bottlenecks, boosting strength — a dazzling array that made one's eyes ache. And every non-ruined pill bore pill patterns!

Judging by these pills' grades, the deceased here had been absolutely a Void King-Grade alchemist in life, and moreover an Upper-Level Void King-Grade alchemist!

An alchemist of that caliber would be exceedingly rare in the present Star Domain; Yang Kai couldn't say whether, in this era, any other alchemist had reached such heights.

Furthermore, this person's pill-crafting skill was unquestionably top-tier, because nearly every vial contained a pill that had produced pill patterns — some vials even held more than one, the most reaching three!

Unfortunately, there were no pills that had produced pill clouds, which made Yang Kai sigh inwardly. Pill patterns were already staggeringly rare; pill clouds above those patterns were outright defiant of heaven. Even with this master's skill and attainments, even he could not guarantee that pills he refined would grow pill clouds.

"Madam, there are one hundred and thirty-five spiritual pills in total here, each with different value. If you trust me, I can distribute them." Yang Kai looked at the Ice Heart Valley woman and said.

"Young Brother, that is only proper — since you're an alchemist, distribution should naturally be done by you; I have no objection!" The woman was magnanimous, which was hardly surprising. Every time a usable pill was taken out, Yang Kai told her what it was and its use. Although many pills now lay before them, she had already appraised the value of each pill, and was not worried about Yang Kai acting underhandedly.

Hearing her say so, Yang Kai nodded slightly and began to distribute the spiritual pills without shirking his duty.

One hundred and thirty-five pills — the quantity was uneven, but if divided by value, it could basically be made equal.

But after Yang Kai split the pills before them into two portions, the woman looked at him in surprise and asked suspiciously, "Little Brother, did you divide them wrong? My side clearly has more pills and seems slightly higher in value. You..."

Yang Kai grinned, "No mistake. Madam, have you forgotten there are other things here besides pills?"

"Other things?" The woman glanced around, and the next moment understood what Yang Kai meant.

The Void King-Grade refining furnace!

When dividing, Yang Kai had obviously factored the value of that Void King-Grade refining furnace into the calculation, which made the two piles appear somewhat unequal.

"Mm, Madam, please choose first." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "If you choose the portion with more pills, the refining furnace will belong to me; otherwise the furnace is yours."

The woman couldn't help showing a hesitant expression.

She had sharp eyes and immediately recognized the furnace's grade, but Yang Kai's approach seemed exceedingly fair — it was simply up to her to weigh her choices. Want more pills and she would have to forgo the furnace; want the furnace and she must give up some pills.

With the two choices laid out, the woman was naturally a little troubled.

Soon, however, she seemed to make up her mind. She pursed her lips and smiled, "Then I will take more of the spiritual pills! Young Brother, since you are an alchemist this refining furnace will no doubt be useful to you; I won't covet it."

Saying that, she took the pile with the greater quantity of spiritual pills.

Yang Kai said nothing further and collected his own share. In truth it hardly mattered to him how she chose; the Void King-Grade refining furnace would be useful, but it wasn't indispensable.

For the woman, having more spiritual pills was undoubtedly better. If she took the furnace back, she'd have to hand it to her sect or give it to another alchemist — far less practical than the immediate benefit in hand.

Her choice was not without reason — there were clear signs leading to it.

As the two finished distributing the pills, the other two Ice Heart Valley women entered in turn, and the young woman recounted what she had gained. Both of the other women's beautiful eyes shone with excitement and they were elated.

Outside, the spiritual herbs had already been harvested; next came distributing the medicinal materials.

Nearly a thousand plants of tens of thousands of years' medicinal age — the four of them took half a day to tally and finish distributing.

But no matter who it was, all wore joyful expressions — Yang Kai included. With so much base material, he wouldn't lack ingredients for refining in the future, and becoming a Void King-Grade alchemist would be only a matter of time.

After all the fuss, things here were done.

"Young Brother, there shouldn't be anything else here; do you want to leave with us?" The young woman looked at Yang Kai and asked.

Yang Kai pondered and slowly shook his head, "You three go first; I still have some matters to attend to."

"Oh?" The woman was surprised and puzzled, not understanding why Yang Kai wanted to stay. She sent out her Divine Sense to scan the surroundings, even over the cross-legged skeleton, leaving nothing unchecked.

She thought Yang Kai had perhaps found something else to occupy him and planned to stay behind to take it once they left, but after probing with Divine Sense, there was clearly nothing else here.

Yang Kai was well aware of her thoughts. He glanced at her and explained calmly, "I just want to bury this skeleton."

"Uh..." The woman looked embarrassed.

"He was an alchemist; he was also my predecessor in the field. I obtained his refining furnace; for reasons of propriety and conscience I should at least do something for him."

"I see, hehe. Very well then; my sisters and I will take our leave." The woman's face reddened slightly, feeling she had misjudged his character, and she laughed awkwardly before bidding farewell with the other two women.

Naturally, Yang Kai made no effort to stop them. Though he had cooperated seamlessly with the three women, they were, in the end, little more than passing acquaintances—and that young woman was far from simple, having seemingly intended to make a move against him earlier.

Cooperation was fine, but Yang Kai had no interest in forming close ties with such people.

A while later, outside the valley, the three Ice Heart Valley women sped away; the other two were in high spirits, but the leading young woman wore an unsettled expression, as if annoyed about something. After a long time she sighed heavily.

"What's the matter, Senior Sister?" the woman at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm asked in puzzlement.

"Nothing. I just feel that youth was a little strange." The young woman shook her head slowly.

Earlier in the stone chamber, the place had been cramped and with three of them present it was ideal for an ambush. The thought had occurred to the young woman to conspire with her two junior sisters to subdue Yang Kai there.

After all, so many spiritual pills with pill patterns and so many medicinal materials of tens of thousands of years' age — no one wanted to let another take half.

But when that thought passed through her mind, a chilling sense rose from deep within her: a warning that if she truly conspired with her junior sisters to strike, she herself would be the one to suffer.

That very chill is what made the young woman ultimately decide not to act.

Looking back now, she didn't know whether that choice had been right or wrong.

Regardless, being parted from half the benefits by someone only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm left her feeling uneasy.

Regret now was of no use; she could only suppress the faint resentment deep in her heart and try not to dwell on it.

Meanwhile, inside the stone chamber in the valley, Yang Kai sighed softly.

He had not lied to the Ice Heart Valley women — he had truly intended to find a burial for this alchemical master. After all, the man had been a top-tier Upper-Level Void King-Grade alchemist who had still been refining at the moment of death. As a fellow alchemist, Yang Kai felt a respectful solemnity.

After claiming the Void King-Grade refining furnace, Yang Kai waved his hand and a stream of pure Saint Yuan flowed out, enveloping the skeleton, then drifted lightly outward.

"Let him sleep forever beneath these medicinal fields," Yang Kai decided silently.

This burial place ought to be what the predecessor would have wished.

Moments later Yang Kai came to the medicinal fields. He snapped his fingers and sent out strands of Saint Yuan that struck the ground and hollowed out a pit several zhang in diameter, then carefully placed the skeleton into it.

The entire process contained no mistakes; the skeleton's garments remained as they had been in life when placed within.

Yet, the moment Yang Kai withdrew the Saint Yuan shielding the remains, the garments on the skeleton instantly turned to dust, scattering away with the wind.
