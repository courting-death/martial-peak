## Chapter 1725 — Struck by Lightning

The Sea Race experts had long since learned what the Huntian Pill did from Qian Mo and Shang Ao; although they knew the Huntian Pill's effects were heaven-defying, its principal ingredient only existed on Ghost Isle, so even if they wanted it, there was no way for them to obtain it.

Little Dolphin did have a few, but not many — they were things Yang Kai had given her before, effectively her own possessions.

Who would dare take the Princess of the Sea Race's pills? Even Lie Kong only took a single Huntian Pill from Little Dolphin to study; after finishing his research, he returned it to his daughter.

At this moment Yang Kai actually offered five hundred Origin-Grade Huntian Pills, which to the Sea Race was like windfall wealth; with those five hundred Origin-Grade Huntian Pills, the Sea Race's several experts could significantly increase their physical strength.

So when it was heard that Yang Kai was willing to give five hundred Origin-Grade Huntian Pills in exchange for this Sea God Pearl, even Lie Kong could not contain his excitement; joy was plain on his face.

"Indeed!" Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Five hundred Origin-Grade Huntian Pills were a tremendous fortune, but for Lingxiao Sect they were not that significant — the last Huntian Lotus he had brought back had already been handed to Xia Ningshang, and after so long she should have refined quite a number of pills.

Lie Kong said dryly, “How could that be appropriate?”

"If Palace Lord Lie Kong does not agree, then I would be ashamed to accept this Sea God Pearl," Yang Kai said.

Lie Kong hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Since Sect Master Yang is so frank, Lie Kong will not be coy. I agree! May Sea God Palace and Lingxiao Sect enjoy long‑lasting friendship!"

“Very well. Five hundred Huntian Pills. I’ll have them delivered to the Sea God Palace—please wait a few days,” Yang Kai clasped his fists toward the gathered Sea Clan experts. “I’ll be taking my leave now. No need to see me off!”

With that said, Yang Kai stepped directly into the Space Array and, aided by its power, transmitted himself outside Lingxiao Sect.

This unexpectedly obtained Sea God Pearl would indeed be useful to Yang Kai; although he had not cultivated any water arts or secret techniques, the Undying Five Elements Sword required Five Elements Treasures to cultivate.

Among the five elements, the fire treasure required no concern. The Sun's True Essence contained boundless energy, and after using it for so long Yang Kai had seen almost no change in that Sun's True Essence.

The other four elemental treasures, however, had suffered varying degrees of depletion.

Whether it was Thundertree, Profound Yin Moon Water, Xuan Gold, or Dayan Divine Sand, none could sustain much longer.

The Sea God Pearl obtained this time was precisely suited to substitute for Profound Yin Moon Water as material for further cultivation of the Undying Five Elements Sword.

Within the Sea God Pearl was sealed the source of an ocean — its Water Attribute Spiritual Qi was abundant and pure, no lesser in grade than the Profound Yin Moon Water, perhaps even higher. Moreover, the energy contained within it was far greater than that of the Profound Yin Moon Water.

It seemed there was no need to worry about the water treasure for the time being, but the metal, wood, and earth treasures still required attention.

Yet with Yang Kai's current status, finding those three kinds of materials was not difficult — a single order could suffice. Whether they could match a treasure like the Sea God Pearl was another matter.

After returning to Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai visited Ye Xijun and informed her of the deal with Sea God Palace, asking her to send people to collect five hundred Origin-Grade Huntian Pills from Xia Ningshang and deliver them.

Ye Xijun readily agreed.

Over the next two months Yang Kai traveled through the various famous cities and sects on Dark Star, continuously arranging Space Arrays.

Two months later, with the array outside Lingxiao Sect as the root, Lingxiao Sect's network of passages nearly covered the entire Dark Star, so that disciples could go to any city they wished at any time.

This unprecedented undertaking had never before occurred on Dark Star; as a result Lingxiao Sect could now instantly grasp the situation and information across Dark Star and freely procure supplies from every corner of the land.

Yang Kai left Tianyun City for last.

After all, he was to meet Qian Tong — he might as well handle the Space Array arrangements and that matter together.

One day Yang Kai arrived at Tianyun City and looked down at the postwar city from the sky, feeling a surge of emotion.

When he first drifted to Dark Star he had only reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; years had passed and he had now become the pinnacle of Dark Star. Recalling the past, it was at Dragon Lair Mountain outside Tianyun City that he had first risen to prominence and gradually established the present Lingxiao Sect.

The memories of past events returned as if they had happened yesterday.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and headed straight for the city lord's mansion.

Having been ravaged by Corpse Spirit Sect, Tianyun City had been devastated, but after a long period of recovery it had once again prospered.

Fei Zhi Tu remained the city lord of Tianyun City!

When Yang Kai saw him, Fei Zhi Tu had already recovered to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

It seemed that this was partly thanks to having endured the torment of Fang Fengqi from the Corpse Spirit Sect last time — a case of breaking down first, then rising anew.

Yang Kai could not help feeling happy for him; upon learning Yang Kai's purpose, Fei Zhi Tu immediately decided to let him proceed without hindrance.

Yang Kai did not hesitate and began arranging a Space Array in Tianyun City, connecting it with Lingxiao Sect.

In barely two days the Space Array had been set up.

With further study of Space Arrays, Yang Kai had become skilled and could save a great deal of time.

In a flash of white light Fei Zhi Tu disappeared into the Space Array and after a moment reappeared from it, laughing heartily: "Sure enough it transmits to Lingxiao Sect. This is excellent — from now on our sects can come and go freely and need not worry about messages taking days to arrive."

Yang Kai smiled lightly and suddenly asked, "By the way, Elder Fei, has Qian Lao arrived?"

Hearing Yang Kai mention Qian Tong, Fei Zhitu’s expression immediately turned serious. He nodded and said, “He’s already here. But since you were setting up the Space Array, I didn’t want to disturb you. You’d better go see him quickly — that old ghost Qian seems to be troubled by something he can’t resolve.”

"Even Elder Qian cannot resolve it?" Yang Kai was astonished; he could not fathom what matter would leave even Qian Tong at a loss.

While arranging the Space Array here he had already had Fei Zhi Tu send word to Yingyue Hall; two days were enough for Qian Tong to arrive.

Without further delay, Yang Kai followed Fei Zhi Tu to meet Qian Tong.

In a hall of the city lord's mansion Yang Kai entered; inside there were only three people waiting.

The three were all old acquaintances of Yang Kai: besides Qian Tong they were Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, the pair who had endured hardships together.

Seeing Yang Kai, Qian Tong brightened and forced a smile: "You finally arrived, lad."

"Pardon me, Elder Qian. I thought it wasn't urgent, so I did not rush; I've been busy across Dark Star lately." Yang Kai gave an awkward smile — had he known how urgent Qian Tong was, he would have come to Tianyun City first.

Qian Tong laughed: "It wasn't that urgent, otherwise I'd have gone to Lingxiao Sect myself."

At the side, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er rose to greet Yang Kai.

Yang Kai returned their greetings and swept them with Divine Sense; he found their Saint Yuan surging like a sea and their qi fluctuating, clearly on the verge of breakthrough.

No wonder they were Yingyue Hall's finest disciples — less than ten years since rising to the Origin Returning Realm they were about to make another leap. Ordinarily, even with their talent their cultivation would not progress so rapidly; Yang Kai suspected it was related to the last Corpse Spirit Sect disaster on Dark Star.

Warriors often drew out all potential in absolute crisis.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er had several times been close to death during that incident, which greatly benefited their subsequent cultivation.

Young people meeting were always lively.

While Yang Kai spoke with Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu did not interrupt, smiling and watching.

After a while Yang Kai slapped his forehead and looked to Qian Tong: "Right, Elder Qian, why did you call me here? Elder Fei said even you cannot resolve this?"

Qian Tong's expression grew serious and he nodded: "Yes, I truly cannot resolve it, so I came to ask you."

"What specifically?"

"You can tell by looking carefully." Qian Tong did not answer directly; after speaking a vast and wondrous force suddenly poured out of his body and radiated outward.

Domain Field!

A Domain Field belonged only to Void King Realm experts — the ultimate evolution of a Shi field.

Qian Tong had only been raised to the Void King Realm for a few years; within the Void King Realm his Domain Field was not exceedingly powerful, but when it was released the whole heaven and earth seemed to tremble.

Fortunately, he wasn’t directing that pressure at anyone present — in fact, he was even holding himself back. As such, although Wei Guchang and the others felt their bodies grow heavy and their Saint Yuan sluggish, they did not suffer any real harm.

Yang Kai watched Qian Tong closely and suddenly his face changed; his Divine Sense probed around Qian Tong.

Seeing Yang Kai's expression, Qian Tong immediately realized he had discovered something and did his best to maintain the Domain Field so Yang Kai could see more clearly.

After a long time Yang Kai's expression shifted and he withdrew his gaze, frowning.

"You, as the lord of Dark Star, should have noticed something amiss?" Qian Tong dispersed his Domain Field and asked Yang Kai.

Fei Zhi Tu, Wei Guchang, and Xuan'er were bewildered; they saw no problem with Qian Tong. Once his Domain Field was released it pressed down and made people short of breath.

"The world's laws here… are rejecting you?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously, a trace of shock in his eyes.

"You truly saw it." Qian Tong sighed deeply.

"What?" Fei Zhi Tu was amazed: "Old ghost Qian rejected by the world's laws? How could that be possible?"

"Nothing is impossible." Qian Tong shook his head with a bitter smile. "If I were not being rejected by the Heavenly Laws, do you think I was struck by lightning last time for no reason?"
