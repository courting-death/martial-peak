## Chapter 980 — Junior Brother, What Are You Doing

Outside Xia Ningshang's room, the big, rotund Chang Bao launched into a torrent of scolding at Yang Kai, spit flying as he berated him.

"Miss Xia hasn't stepped out of her room for half a month and hasn't refined any pills — you're a real sinner!" Hong Fang likewise scolded him without holding back.

Kong Ruoyu snorted coldly, "As a man, you should make your woman feel safe and secure, not cause her sorrow. You're the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and yet you act so carelessly; as a proper husband you're far from adequate."

Even Du Wan, who was closest to Yang Kai, hurriedly said, "Come up with a way to cheer her up quickly — don't let her be too heartbroken."

In that moment the five masters all seemed to side with Xia Ningshang, fiercely defending her and turning their accusations squarely on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stood there stunned, like a wooden statue.

He had never expected that Little Senior Sister's relationship with the five masters had become so close.

He still remembered when the five masters first came to the Sacred Land, shamelessly insisting on staying to watch him refine pills and to learn the art from him.

During that time, he had won the five masters' respect.

Who would have thought that now, in the masters' estimation, Xia Ningshang's standing would be far above his own.

"Uh..." Yang Kai opened his mouth, but before he could utter a defense, Hong Fang cut him off.

Hong Fang shot him a sidelong glance, displeased: "Kid, I heard you're insisting on going to the starry sky this time to chase after a woman? What woman could possibly measure up to Miss Xia?"

"Exactly — Miss Xia is the best woman under heaven; don't be someone who can't appreciate what he already has."

"Miss Xia is kind-hearted, gentle as flowing water, understanding. Pure and charming — I really don't understand how she could fall for you, you little bastard."

Another round of harsh scolding left Yang Kai utterly speechless.

"Miss Xia, don't be sad!" Kong Ruoyu suddenly called into the side room. "A man who is so fickle isn't worth keeping — I'll introduce someone to you another day; he may not be as good as Yang Kai, but he'd still be a dragon among men."

Yang Kai's face darkened. He said calmly, "Old Kong, if you don't want anything to happen to that man, you'd better not let him come to the Sacred Land."

Kong Ruoyu's eyes flashed: "What? Just because you flirt about, does that mean Miss Xia can't have a choice?"

"That's not what I mean..." Yang Kai found himself at a loss for words; he truly couldn't understand why these five masters had nothing better to do than meddle in matters of love.

Creak...

The door opened, and from the darkness Xia Ningshang stepped into view, her beautiful eyes bright as stars, utterly pure.

But everyone keenly noticed that her eyes were a little swollen and red.

"Don't speak ill of my Junior Brother..." Xia Ningshang's voice was as soft as a mosquito's whistle. She cast a faint look at Yang Kai, bit her thin lip and said, "Besides, the person Junior Brother is going to find is Senior Sister Su Yan — Senior Sister is wonderful."

"Oh-ho, my goodness, you finally came out." Chang Bao cried out, dabbing the sweat from his forehead as he fussed over Xia Ningshang's welfare.

"Junior Brother, come in and speak!" Xia Ningshang pulled Yang Kai inside, tugging him into the room.

Yang Kai turned and forced a smile at the five masters. "Masters, you should rest early as well!"

Without waiting for a reply, he hurriedly shut the door.

"That stinky brat..." Hong Fang, having been put to shame, gave a surprised snort of amusement.

"Alright, with Yang Kai stepping in there shouldn't be a problem." Du Wan chuckled, "Everyone go get some rest."

The masters, having been through similar situations, understood Xia Ningshang's inner pain; their earlier harshness toward Yang Kai had simply been to stir her sympathy and coax her out.

Young people — any problem can be solved by opening up and talking it through.

Inside the side room, after the masters had walked away, Yang Kai looked at Xia Ningshang with an apologetic expression.

"I'm going to find Su Yan. I had planned to come back and tell you first," he said, choosing his words carefully.

"I know!" Xia Ningshang nodded gently. "I won't stop you, I'm just a little reluctant to let you go."

As she said this, a mist of tears welled in her eyes and she threw herself into Yang Kai's arms, burying her head against his chest.

Her tears soaked Yang Kai's garments, and Xia Ningshang's voice came through, "Don't worry about things here; make sure you find Su Yan and bring her back."

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded heavily. With this beauty in his embrace, their bodies pressed close, feeling her softness and warmth — surprisingly, his mind stirred not with temptation but with an intense sorrow and guilt.

Xia Ningshang seemed to sense his worries and murmured softly, "You don't need to feel guilty, because I know if Master had taken me to the starry sky you'd go looking for me too, right?"

"Right!" Yang Kai tightened his hold, thankful for Little Senior Sister's understanding.

"And I believe you will find her." Xia Ningshang suddenly lifted her head, her beautiful eyes curving like moon crescents.

"Why?"

“Because you already found me once before!” Xia Ningshang’s expression was full of unwavering belief. “This time you won’t fail either. If two people are destined to be together, then no matter how far apart they are, no matter how much time passes, they’ll always find their way back to each other. That’s what I always thought, and what I always believed. And then… when I was at my loneliest, when I had no one to turn to, you…” Her voice grew quieter as she spoke, as if she had reached something too shy and difficult to put into words.

"I what?" Yang Kai stared at her, a strange smile tugging at his lips.

Xia Ningshang looked bashful, her gaze flickering. Her small hand gripped Yang Kai's clothes, her voice so low it was almost inaudible: "You appeared like a hero."

At that, the color flooded her cheeks as if blood would spill, and her delicate body grew even hotter.

She was not the type to let herself go or to lay all her feelings bare; this outpouring of sincere emotion was already the utmost she could show.

She suddenly recalled the time in Jiuyin Valley, when they had gone together to obtain the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew and were ambushed.

Inside that narrow passage through the mountain, when she was in mortal danger, Yang Kai stood alone before her and fought, drenched in blood.

At that time his silhouette was not as heroic as it would later become — even a little frail — yet he stood firm like a mountain, shielding her from all storms and dangers.

It was then that that figure quietly entered her heart, took root in the heart of a young girl and plucked the strings of her feelings.

Whenever she thought back to that scene, Xia Ningshang’s heart felt as though it had been filled with honey—warm and sweet.

Separated from Yang Kai for more than ten years, following Master far and wide, she had met countless outstanding youths, including many heirs from great Sects and prominent families, any of whom unabashedly declared their admiration for her.

Yet she remained steadfast; her heart did not stir for any man.

She had been waiting all along.

Finally, her wish was fulfilled.

When Master was trapped and she could find no way out, in that moment of despair, that figure appeared before her again, dispersing the clouds that had hidden all hope and letting her see boundless dawn.

In that instant she felt that even if she died then and there, it would have been worthwhile. No one could fathom the excitement and joy she felt.

Now he was about to leave, and what she must do was wait.

She would wait in happiness and hope. She felt patient enough — come rain or shine, through all changes of the world, she would continue to wait.

Her body lightened and Xia Ningshang couldn't help but let out a soft cry; when she came to her senses she found herself cradled sideways in Yang Kai's arms.

His arms were strong and powerful; being held in his crook felt like the most peaceful harbor, allowing her to relax and let go of all weariness.

"Junior Brother, what are you doing?" Xia Ningshang called in a tiny, coquettish voice as she realized Yang Kai was gazing at her with a meaningful smile, leading her step by step toward the perfumed bed.

Under that tender, watery gaze, Xia Ningshang felt as if she were the thawing snow of early spring, about to melt away.

She vaguely sensed what was coming; her heart beat wildly, her breath quickened, and her delicate body flushed with waves of astonishing heat.

Yang Kai still wore that odd, secret smile, silent and strange; that smile made Xia Ningshang close her lovely eyes, bite her red lips, and turn her head away, unable to meet his gaze.

With a lightness to her body, Xia Ningshang found herself lying on the bed; outside the window, pure moonlight poured in and bathed her.

Yang Kai sat on the bedside, staring at the gorgeous scene in a daze, his large hand gently playing with Little Senior Sister's hair.

"Little Senior Sister, do you remember that night in Lingxiao Pavilion when I came back from going out and found you asleep in my bed?" Yang Kai suddenly asked.

Xia Ningshang slowly opened her eyes and whispered, "That was so long ago, I don't remember."

How could she not remember? It was simply too shameful to admit.

That day, she had gone to deliver a message to Yang Kai; at that time the two were not familiar and had scarcely exchanged words. She waited in the wooden hut but Yang Kai never returned.

Waiting and waiting, she fell asleep.

When she awoke she found Yang Kai standing by the bedside, looking at her with a mesmerized gaze.

Xia Ningshang did not know when he had returned, but she remembered clearly that his look then held no lewdness, only astonishment.

He seemed unwilling to wake her.

“At that time, it was almost exactly like this,” Yang Kai’s voice was gentle, his gaze filled with longing. “Moonlight poured down upon you, and the sapphire on your forehead shimmered with misty radiance. In that moment, this Junior Brother was struck by your beauty, like that of a celestial being. I felt such envy then, wondering who in the future would be fortunate enough to have you—never imagining that the fortunate one would turn out to be me.”

Those sincere, tender words pierced Little Senior Sister's defenses like a sharp blade, causing her to lose herself amid the sweet talk, seeing no way out, surrounded by a great tide called happiness.

Her eyes went hazy, her delicate earlobes flushed, the tender flesh of her neck bloomed with an unusual redness, her heart pounded quickly and powerfully, waves of heat rose within her; she looked at Yang Kai with an expectant, different kind of gaze and reached up to take hold of his neck.

She surrendered in an instant.
