## Chapter 379 — Conditions

Lü Liang's tone was exceptionally harsh, but Yang Kai remained unmoved as he listened.

Lü Si observed his reaction and secretly nodded, realizing that this young master of the Yang Family was not an unreasonable person.

With a gentle smile, Yang Kai casually remarked, “Since the head of the Lü Family has said so, let us not speak of the Yang Crystal Jade Bed for now.”

Outside the room, Lü Liang snorted lightly, his expression slightly cloudy.

"As long as you do not have any designs on our Yang Crystal Jade Bed, everything else can be discussed."

“Elder Si, if you don’t mind, how about we talk about you?” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at Lü Si with a relaxed demeanor.

Even Lü Si, who had reached the realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, couldn’t help but feel somewhat taken aback. He pointed to his own nose and asked, “About me?”

“Indeed.” Yang Kai nodded with a calm expression.

“Feel free to speak, Young Master Yang. I am all ears,” Lü Si chuckled, revealing an interested expression.

It was amusing that a young man would so nonchalantly boast in front of him and even dared to speak about himself.

Since stepping into the realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, very few had dared to be so casual in front of him.

For a moment, Lü Si was also curious to know what Yang Kai would say and whether he would utter any absurdities.

“Then I shall be rude.” Yang Kai said this while showing no intention of modesty, casually stating, “Elder Si, you have reached the realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm and have arrived at the peak of Martial Arts in this world. Unless those renowned figures in the same realm come to face you, it can be said that there are very few among mortals who can rival you.”

Lü Si smiled slightly.

“What the realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm is truly like, I am unclear. However, I do know that once you reach this level, it becomes exceedingly difficult to rely on external forces for enhancement. Whether it be spiritual pills or secret tomes, one might find it impossible to boost Elder Si’s strength any further! If you wish to elevate your capabilities, it seems you can only rely on your personal insights into Martial Arts and break the constraints of heaven and earth!”

Lü Si’s expression became serious, and he stared at Yang Kai with mild surprise, not understanding how he knew this.

Yang Kai read his expression and smiled with confidence, “But all this time, Elder Si, you have been sitting on this jade bed without moving an inch. Moreover, you have been sitting on it for years!”

“Yes.” Lü Si nodded lightly.

“Your reason for doing this is likely twofold; one is to cultivate using this jade bed to enhance yourself, but I just mentioned that at your level, relying on external forces is almost impossible. Therefore, we can dismiss this reason!”

“Don’t be so hasty, Young Master Yang.” Lü Si chuckled. “Though my current strength indeed cannot draw on external forces to enhance myself, I can consolidate my cultivation using this jade bed.”

“No, no, no, Elder Si, you are not cultivating a Yang attribute cultivation method, so sitting on it is unrelated to cultivation!” Yang Kai asserted.

Lü Si’s expression shifted with intrigue, looking at him with suspicion. “How do you know I do not cultivate a Yang attribute cultivation method?”

At his level of skill, his aura was restrained, and unless he released his True Yuan, not even someone at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm could detect anything. What gave Yang Kai such confidence?

Yang Kai grinned and did not explain further.

Lü Si was astonished and ceased to deny it. “Young Master Yang is correct; my sitting here indeed has nothing to do with cultivation.”

Yang Kai straightened up and smiled disdainfully, “Then there is only one explanation: Elder Si, you have been sitting here to... heal injuries, or perhaps something related to healing.”

Lü Si's gaze narrowed slightly, while outside, the people of the Lü Family held their breath, not daring to make a sound. A chill ran through them as they marveled at Yang Kai’s keen insight!

Lü Si was the backbone and guarantee of the Lü Family’s status as a first-rate clan, but the fact that he suffered from a chronic ailment was the family’s greatest secret. If this secret were to spread, it might bring about unforeseen consequences.

Without needing to mention the other first-rate clan nearby, they would likely seize the opportunity to strike.

Seemingly oblivious to the dangerous gleam in Lü Si's eyes, Yang Kai continued talking with an unfazed demeanor, “Although Elder Si’s aura is repressed to the extreme, there remains a subtle feeling of weakness. Moreover, when True Yuan flows through your body, it does not do so continuously but rather with occasional stagnation. If I am not mistaken... Elder Si, your meridians are somewhat blocked, aren’t they?”

Lü Si’s eyes flashed with brilliance, and he fixed his gaze on Yang Kai, his expression changeable, while a storm raged within his heart!

The young man in front of him, indeed only at the seventh stage of the True Yuan Realm!

However, his insight was far sharper and more precise than many experts in the realm of Divine Roaming! His observations and deductions were strikingly close to his current condition!

Lü Si's expression gradually became strange, while the Lü Family members outside wore looks of shock and confusion!

It seemed like a significant secret had been unearthed.

Yang Kai, however, chuckled and said casually, “If others dared to speak so freely in front of you, Elder, they would likely end up as a corpse on the spot.”

“Indeed!” Lü Si nodded solemnly. “For the peace of the Lü Family, the death of a few people isn’t considered a big deal!”

“But I am different, aren’t I? The Lü Family cannot and will not dare to kill me.” Yang Kai continued, displaying an expression of unwarranted confidence.

Lü Si laughed in astonishment, while Lü Liang and the others shook their heads helplessly.

“Now that I know Lü Family’s biggest secret, what do you think should be used to silence me, Elder Si?” Yang Kai looked at him with a smile.

Lü Si’s expression was bizarre; for the first time, he felt somewhat restrained in front of a young man. The background behind Yang Kai and his identity truly troubled Lü Si.

“Please, Young Master Yang, feel free to state your requirements, but this Yang Crystal Jade Bed is absolutely off-limits.” Lü Si felt a deep regret; he had long suspected this brat had ulterior motives, yet out of curiosity, he had invited him to speak. He didn’t expect that he would be shooting himself in the foot, such unfortunate luck to have a thief eyeing him!

Yang Kai's brows furrowed slightly; Lü Si’s words revealed the importance of the Yang Crystal Jade Bed to him.

This large piece of precious jade was at least a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure, brimming with pure and rich Yang energy. Lü Si relied on this gentle Yang energy to alleviate the blockages in his meridians. If Yang Kai were to take it away, Lü Si would likely be in dire straits, and the Lü Family would not simply sit idly by.

After a moment of contemplation, Yang Kai raised his head and asked, “Elder Si, is there really no other solution for this situation?”

If Lü Si could cease relying on the Yang Crystal Jade Bed to help clear his meridians, Yang Kai might persuade him to part with it. If there was no other way, Yang Kai would have to abandon this idea.

“There is.” To Yang Kai’s surprise, Lü Si nodded upon hearing his question.

“Oh? What method?” Yang Kai asked eagerly, seeing a glimmer of hope.

“I need a Xuan Dan!” Lü Si smiled at Yang Kai. “If you can find this Xuan Dan for me, I will give you the Yang Crystal Jade Bed.”

He spoke lightly, but Yang Kai understood that it was certainly not an ordinary pill.

“A mystery-grade pill?” Yang Kai forced a smile.

“Correct, and it’s a middle-level mystery-grade pill!” Lü Si added.

Yang Kai felt helpless; middle-level mystery-grade pills were a rarity, with very few capable of refining such pills across the land. Not to mention the slim chances of success in refining, obtaining the materials was a challenge. Surely, each middle-level mystery-grade pill was worth over a million taels!

However... this kind of Xuan Dan was not completely impossible to refine. Yang Kai knew of two people who could.

Xiao Fusheng and Xia Ningshang!

Xiao Fusheng was the world’s most top-notch alchemist, capable of creating upper-level mystery-grade pills!

Meanwhile, Xia Ningshang had previously been able to refine lower-level mystery-grade pills. With the time that had passed, her strength would have surely grown, and refining middle-level mystery-grade pills should now be no difficulty.

Seemingly noticing Yang Kai's dilemma, Lü Si chuckled again, “I can take a step back and help you gather the materials for refining. If you can find someone to refine the Xuan Dan for me, the Yang Crystal Jade Bed will still be yours!”

“Really?” Yang Kai's expression brightened.

Lü Si was momentarily startled, feeling an ominous premonition. He silently wondered why this young man appeared so excited! Instead of feeling the situation was troublesome, he instead looked eager.

Could it be he knew some master alchemist?

But Lü Si, being a person of the realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, knew that words once spoken could not be taken back. Nodding solemnly, he declared, “Indeed!”

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “Then this is settled. Elder Si, your Yang Crystal Jade Bed will likely be changing ownership soon.”

Seeing him so confident, Lü Si's interest finally piqued, and he impatiently asked, “Do you have a plan?”

“Of course, I have a way!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly.

Lü Si became slightly breathless; he had been trapped by his meridian issues on this Yang Crystal Jade Bed for years, seldom leaving this place. While he was revered as a figure in the realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, the pain was something only he understood. He was really just a pitiful person trapped in this room.

If he genuinely acquired that Xuan Dan, Lü Si could finally break free. Compared to his freedom, even a Yang Crystal Jade Bed was of little value.

After a tough swallow, Lü Si suppressed the tremor in his voice and asked, “Young Master Yang, do you know any great masters?”

Yang Kai grinned and nodded, “I spent some time at Yao Wang Valley's Hidden Cloud Peak!”

Lü Si's expression shifted slightly, and the Lü Family members outside also appeared bewildered.

After a while, Lü Si finally asked, “Hidden Cloud Peak? Xiao Fusheng?”

“Indeed.”

Lü Si’s expression grew strange; he scrutinized Yang Kai from head to toe and frowned, “Young Master Yang isn’t joking, is he?”

“Of course not.”

Lü Si's expression became increasingly odd, and after a long moment, he slowly shook his head. “It's not that I don’t trust you, Young Master Yang, but... it seems Master Xiao only has one disciple, and it’s a female. Furthermore, I personally visited Hidden Cloud Peak two months ago and didn’t see you there at all.”
