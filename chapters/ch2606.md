## Chapter 2606 — Urgency

The little girl called Ling'er tilted her head, her big eyes blinking curiously as she sized up Yang Kai.

However, she clearly did not remember Yang Kai. Although they had met more than ten years ago in Yuqing Mountain, back then Ling'er had only just gained sentience, so she could not recall much. She only vaguely felt that the person before her looked somewhat familiar.

Yang Kai gave her a harmless smile.

Luan Feng's heart skipped. She feared Yang Kai might take a fancy to her daughter and spirit her away. She shot a glance at a nearby maid and said, "Take her away—don't disturb Sir Yang."

The maid hurriedly replied, "Yes!"

As she spoke, she reached out to take Ling'er's hand, apologized, and slowly led her away.

Watching Ling'er disappear from sight, Luan Feng let out a slight sigh of relief, secretly deciding that as long as Yang Kai stayed in the palace, she would never let Ling'er meet him again.

The descendants of Divine Spirits were immensely attractive to any human. Whether or not they could be of help, just the identity of a Divine Spirit descendant was enough to awe many. If Yang Kai were truly to spirit Ling’er away, Luan Feng would be left with nothing but regret. Besides, Ling'er was quite playful, making her hard to watch over.

"Sir Yang, this way please!" Luan Feng gestured.

Yang Kai nodded, and together with the Third Disciple, followed Luan Feng into the Fengluo Palace.

The palace was grand and imposing, with exquisite interior decorations. It was clear that Luan Feng knew how to enjoy herself in this regard.

Inside, there were pavilions and towers, with dragons and phoenixes carved everywhere, displaying the grandeur of a great house.

After leading Yang Kai deep into a courtyard, Luan Feng finally said, "Sir Yang, see if this place suits you. If not, we can find another."

Yang Kai glanced around. There was nothing to be dissatisfied with, so he nodded, "It's fine!"

Luan Feng breathed a sigh of relief, then turned to the seven maids who had followed and said, "You will serve Sir Yang here during this time. Whatever he asks, you must fulfill. Otherwise, I will not forgive you lightly."

The seven maids, all at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, quickly replied, "Yes!"

Inwardly, they could not help but worry. The Saint Venerable had said to satisfy Sir Yang's every request. If he had improper desires, what would they do? Men were no good, whether human or yao.

But since the Saint Venerable had given the order, they dared not disobey in the slightest.

"Sir Yang, if there is nothing else, I will take my leave. If you need anything, just instruct them." Luan Feng smiled at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded and said, "Lady Feng, please go about your business. And do pay extra attention to those rare spirit flowers and herbs."

Luan Feng smiled bitterly, knowing she had not escaped this ordeal, but could only reply, "Rest assured, Sir, I will handle it."

With that, she respectfully took her leave.

After she left, Yang Kai walked forward, looked around, and pointed to a pavilion on the left, "Third Disciple, will you stay here for now?"

Third Disciple glanced at the pavilion and asked, "Will Master also stay here?"

Yang Kai smiled, "I'll stay over there!"

He pointed to another pavilion nearby.

Third Disciple immediately looked troubled, "But I should serve Master at all times..."

"It's not far, it's fine." Yang Kai waved his hand, not waiting for the Third Disciple to object further, then turned to a maid and asked, "What's your name?"

The maid gave a respectful bow and replied, "Sir, my name is Tianlong."

Yang Kai nodded and said, “Please take her away and help her bathe. Find some clean clothes for her to change into as well.”

In her current state, the Third Disciple was not fit to be seen. That Ice Heart Valley uniform had not been changed in who knows how many years, her hair was a mess, her face dirty, and she even smelled a bit sour, like overripe fruit.

Now that they were settled, Yang Kai naturally wanted her to clean up first. Otherwise, her appearance was truly unsightly.

"Yes!" Tianlong replied, then took the Third Disciple by the arm and led her away.

The Third Disciple seemed a bit flustered. Yang Kai quickly reassured her, "Come see me after you've cleaned up!"

Yang Kai's words still worked well on the Third Disciple. With a single command, she calmed down immediately.

After Tianlong took the Third Disciple away, Yang Kai waved to the other six maids, "You may go about your business. I don't need your service here."

The six maids looked delighted, bowed, and left without another word.

They had truly feared Yang Kai would make some improper requests. With the Saint Venerable's order, they would have been powerless to resist. But this human seemed easy to get along with, which put them at ease.

After sending everyone away, Yang Kai walked alone into the pavilion and went straight up to the second floor.

The second floor was spacious, with all necessary furnishings. Yang Kai sat down at the table and sighed softly.

This trip to the Ancient Land had been full of unexpected dangers.

Facing the Four Great Saint Venerables, he had once again felt that sense of helplessness. His spatial abilities were useless before them. If not for Ruoxi's bloodline suddenly awakening, things might have ended badly.

And Ruoxi turned out to be a descendant of Heaven’s Punisher. This truly shocked Yang Kai.

But now that her bloodline had awakened and she had entered the Blood Gate, as long as she could come out, she would surely inherit her ancestor's power. And Xiaoxiao, who went in with her, would become the Divine Spirit Tai Yue.

Even the Incarnation had obtained Shi Huo's Origin, with hopes of becoming the next Divine Spirit Shi Huo.

All in all, though this trip was dangerous, the gains were immense. Not to mention the wealth he extorted, and the million Inner Cores he got from the Tomb of All Spirits. Who knew how much of Shi Huo's legacy there was, or what the other three Saint Venerables would give him?

Setting aside future and present benefits, Yang Kai felt an urgent desire to strengthen himself!

This time, Ruoxi's bloodline awakening had resolved the crisis. But what about next time? If he encountered another Divine Spirit or a Great Emperor-level expert, how would he cope? He could not count on luck every time.

In terms of means, his abilities and divine arts were second to none: space abilities, the Years Like a Shuttle Seal, the Golden Sacred Dragon's Origin Power, the sealed power of the Ancient Giant Demon—each was world-shaking.

As for Secret Treasures, he had the Mountain and River Bell. That alone was enough to make others envious.

The only thing lacking was cultivation!

First Stage of the Emperor Realm—neither strong nor weak, but rather awkward.

He still needed to cultivate, to work even harder!

With this thought, Yang Kai stopped daydreaming. With a wave of his hand, the Purple Void Cauldron appeared before him. His Divine Sense shuttled between his Spatial Ring and the Small Xuan Realm, searching for suitable materials.

Now that he was an Imperial-Grade Alchemist, he had enough materials to refine quite a few Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills.

With the aid of Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills, his cultivation would progress twice as fast with half the effort.

So he planned to refine some Spiritual Pills first, which would also help him hone his alchemy skills and prepare for refining the Life Origin Fruit in the future.

He took out stalk after stalk of Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herbs and placed Inner Cores before him. Countless pill recipes flashed through his mind, and he finally decided, based on his materials, to refine several types of pills to aid cultivation.

Emperor Yuan poured into the Purple Void Cauldron, and flames immediately blazed, raising the room's temperature considerably.

But before Yang Kai could put the Spiritual Herbs into the cauldron, he suddenly sensed something, looked up, and gazed outside.

The maid named Tianlong came running over in a panic, her face anxious, as if something major had happened.

"Sir Yang!" As she neared the pavilion, Tianlong quickly called out.

"What is it?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Sir Yang, please go take a look. Your disciple suddenly went mad and refused to cooperate with the bath!" Tianlong replied anxiously.

Yang Kai's face darkened. This was not good.

The Third Disciple's mental state was extremely unstable. From Tianlong's words, it seemed her mind was in chaos again.

In a flash, Yang Kai appeared at Tianlong's side and said in a deep voice, "Lead the way!"

Tianlong was startled, not knowing how Yang Kai had appeared, but dared not ask and quickly led the way, moving like the wind.

In no time, the two arrived at a side hall, which seemed to be the bathing area. In the center was a large pool filled with flowers, giving off a fragrant aroma. Light curtains of gauze fluttered around the hall.

At this moment, the other six maids were also there, anxiously searching everywhere.

Seeing Yang Kai arrive, the six maids hurried forward and knelt, trembling.

Yang Kai glanced around in surprise, "Where is the Third Disciple?"

Tianlong replied anxiously, "We don't know."

Yang Kai frowned, "What happened exactly?"

Tianlong answered, "Everything was fine before, but just as we were about to bathe your disciple, she suddenly changed, told us to catch her, and in the blink of an eye, she disappeared."

There was something she dared not say: the Third Disciple had acted like a madwoman, completely unreasonable.

Yang Kai slapped his forehead, blaming himself for being careless.

He waved his hand, "It's not your fault. Get up."

"Thank you, Sir!" The six kneeling maids breathed a sigh of relief.

Yang Kai looked around and found that the side hall had only one exit, the rest sealed. He asked, "Did any of you see the Third Disciple leave?"

The six maids exchanged glances and shook their heads. That was the strange part—they had searched the entire hall and found nothing. If she had not left, where could she be?

Hearing this, Yang Kai calmed down, looked around, and coldly snorted, "Third Disciple, if you don't come out, your Master will get angry. You have three breaths to show yourself, or you'll face the sect rules!"
