## Chapter 1522 — Shocks in Succession

In the hall, Yang Kai wore a composed expression, while Yang Xiuzhu and the other two bore looks of exhilaration!

Ever since tens of thousands of years ago, the Taixuan Sect's remnants were forced to relocate away from Flowing Flame Sandland; every generation dreamed of one day returning to their ancestral soil, yet the Flowing Flame Sandland's natural barrier filled them with dread and left them powerless.

Now, Yang Kai's proposal had precisely scratched that itch for Yang Xiuzhu and the others.

Had they come from any other power, they might not have been so interested — the ancestral holdings belonged to their ancestors, tens of thousands of years had passed, the sect had prospered and even changed its name; why go back?

But for those within Star Emperor Mountain, matters were a little different.

Because of their creed, because of their faith, all held the Emperor in the highest reverence!

Taixuan Sect—now that was the sect personally established and nurtured by the Great Emperor, the very place once graced by that presence. In comparison, the later-founded Star Emperor Mountain simply could not measure up.

That ancestral land represented not only respect for their forebears, but also worship of the Emperor.

No Star Emperor Mountain cultivator did not long to return to the ancestral land and pay homage at the Emperor's old residence!

Yang Kai's proposal hit the mark for Yang Xiuzhu and the others; truly, this suggestion was even more enticing than the first.

The first option concerned only the three of them; this one concerned everyone.

The three exchanged glances and each saw the stir of interest in the other's eyes.

"Mm, now that Elder Ye is also a Great Elder of our Lingxiao Sect, if you are descendants of the Taixuan Sect then entering and residing there is perfectly fine," Yang Kai struck while the iron was hot.

"Do you not fear the host being overwhelmed by guests, inviting wolves into the house?" Yang Xiuzhu fixed a glittering gaze on Yang Kai and asked sharply.

“Senior jests. Setting aside the fact that the Great Elder will be there, I know you would never do such a thing. Based on the character of you few Seniors alone, this junior has full faith. You are not people who chase after fame or profit—so I have nothing to worry about.”

"The lad speaks plainly!" Yang Xiuzhu barked low. "Fine, we agree to your conditions and will help you succeed! But let it be said beforehand: if my Star Emperor Mountain brethren truly go to the ancestral land, we ask Sect Master Yang to allocate a separate territory for us to live and operate in. We will not join the Lingxiao Sect — that must be clear to Sect Master Yang."

"Won't join?" Yang Kai's mouth twitched as he inwardly cursed the old fellow as crafty as a fox; by courting them so strongly and dangling the ancestral land he intended to fold Star Emperor Mountain's many strong experts into Lingxiao Sect. He hadn't expected to be seen through at a glance, and for them to state their demand up front.

This left him feeling quite displeased.

Two tigers cannot share one mountain; though Yang Kai did not fear they would harm Lingxiao Sect, he did not want so many Origin Returning Realm experts from Star Emperor Mountain he could not use; that was not what he hoped to see.

If that were truly the case, friction and conflict might inevitably arise between them as time passed.

With that thought, Yang Kai revealed a look of extreme regret. "Very well, since you say so, I naturally have no reason to refuse — but... what a pity!"

"Pity what?" Yang Xiuzhu knew Yang Kai might be playing some bait-and-release trick, but he was still tantalized, eyes full of suspicion.

"Nothing." Yang Kai gave a soft chuckle. "I merely thought that if you were to join the Lingxiao Sect, then given time there might be a chance to see the Emperor's countenance; but if you only get a separated territory, then..."

"Then what?" Yang Xiuzhu's whole body shuddered, and Lin Yurao and Chu Hanyi's eyes gleamed.

"Sect Master Yang, what do you mean by that?" Lin Yurao inclined her slender form.

"Has the Great Elder not told you?" Yang Kai turned to Ye Xijun, playing coy.

Ye Xijun gently shook her head, having understood Yang Kai's intent; she did not expose him, merely smiled and said, "It concerns grave matters; I did not dare speak."

"Indeed, such things cannot be spoken of lightly; the fewer who know, the better," Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"Sect Master Yang, what did you just mean...?" Yang Xiuzhu asked urgently, face anxious. "From what you said it sounds as if the Emperor is currently... within the Lingxiao Sect?"

Even he was startled by the words as they left his mouth and hurriedly shook his head, looking incredulous.

"Elder, you are not wrong — the Emperor indeed is currently within the Lingxiao Sect!" Yang Kai grinned broadly.

"Impossible!" Yang Xiuzhu and the others leaped to their feet, bodies trembling, as if seeing a ghost by daylight.

"I have no reason to deceive you three. If you doubt me, ask the Great Elder," Yang Kai gestured.

The three turned their gazes to Ye Xijun, who gave a slight nod.

Yang Xiuzhu was left stunned; the shock of the news struck him like a ten-thousand‑catty hammer, leaving him dizzy and unable to collect himself for a long time.

The Emperor, after all, was a powerful figure born of legends; although Yang Xiuzhu and the others always believed the Emperor lived on, merely sleeping in some hidden place, that was merely faith.

When belief becomes reality, even the most convinced can waver in doubt — a fear that one's hope might turn to disappointment.

"Is there any proof?" Lin Yurao demanded sharply. "Is there any evidence to prove this? Even if the Great Elder vouches for it, we cannot accept it lightly; Sect Master Yang, please produce proof."

Yang Xiuzhu and Chu Hanyi came back to their senses and nodded vigorously beside her.

"What proof do you want?" Yang Kai smiled.

"Anything will do, as long as it proves the matter. If true... why wouldn't we join the Lingxiao Sect?" Yang Xiuzhu's face contorted as he shouted, making clear he would not relent until Yang Kai produced proof.

If the Emperor was in the Lingxiao Sect, would it be a humiliation for them to join?

If that were the case, forget about Yang Kai trying to recruit them; they would beg and crawl their way in to join!

"Whether I have proof or not, even if I did produce it, could you recognize it?" Yang Kai gave a contemptuous smile.

"Whether we can recognize it or not, we will judge for ourselves. But if Sect Master Yang speaks idly, I shall not forgive him!" Yang Xiuzhu retorted.

Yang Kai's expression froze; he had not expected things to come to this. Being asked to immediately produce proof put him momentarily at a loss.

Suddenly a bright idea flashed through his mind and he laughed heartily, "Very well, then, watch closely."

As he finished speaking, something suddenly appeared in his palm and he raised it high.

The force of Imperial Might surged forth in waves.

Everyone's expressions changed as they stared in astonishment.

After a moment, Yang Xiuzhu cried out, "The Star Emperor Token! It is the Star Emperor Token!"

He had seen the Star Emperor Token before. Star Emperor Mountain had once possessed two of them—one served as the symbol of the Great Emperor, enshrined atop Lingjue Peak, where all of Star Emperor Mountain’s members offered their worship.

The other served as the symbol of the helm of Star Emperor Mountain and was held by the sect master.

But now only one remained in Star Emperor Mountain; the second had been taken by Ye Xijun years ago and, through a circuitous route, ended up in Yang Kai's hands.

Yang Xiuzhu had often gone to Lingjue Peak to pay homage to the Emperor and was naturally familiar with the Star Emperor Token.

However, the Star Emperor Tokens he had seen before were all ones that had already released their power.

The one in Yang Kai's hand, however, was intact — meaning it still sealed within it a divine art of the Emperor, a power said in legend to be capable of easily killing an Origin Returning Realm expert!

The three's eyes shook violently.

Even Ye Xijun's expression turned grave.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu standing to the side watched with eyes wide.

No one expected Yang Kai to possess such a heaven-defying relic!

With that token he could easily wipe out the entire Star Emperor Mountain — even unifying Dark Star would be no problem.

Shocked, Yang Xiuzhu and the others grew terrified; they secretly feared that if they drove Yang Kai too far, he might truly use it against Star Emperor Mountain, and the mountain's two hundred brethren might not survive.

"This Star Emperor Token was personally given to me by the Emperor. Believe it if you will; you asked for proof so I produce it. Besides this, there is one secret the Emperor told me that might further prove my words."

"Sect Master Yang, speak!" Yang Xiuzhu no longer dared treat Yang Kai lightly and his demeanour had turned much more respectful.

“The Great Emperor said that the current Flowing Flame Sandland is nothing more than the manifestation of the Imperial Treasure, the Three Flames Ring! You are all people of age—perhaps some of the younger generation among you have ventured into the Flowing Flame Sandland and know that it contains three layers of Heat-Flame Zones. Those three zones are precisely the three fire rings of the Imperial Treasure. As for why one of them vanished some time ago, it was because the Great Emperor personally took it back.”

Their mouths fell open, astonished.

They had never heard such sensational secrets!

Even Ye Xijun did not know that Flowing Flame Sandland had been formed from the Imperial Treasure, and a strange brilliance rose in her beautiful eyes.

Yet the Three Flames Ring was indeed recorded in sect records; it was said to be the Emperor's most relied-upon secret treasure.

With the Emperor's divine arts, it was not unimaginable that one treasure could form the Dark Star's forbidden land for tens of thousands of years.

"Sect Master Yang says... that the missing first Heat-Flame Zone was personally taken by the Emperor?" Yang Xiuzhu asked, voice trembling.

"Correct. I saw it with my own eyes," Yang Kai nodded.

A collective intake of cold air rippled through the hall.

Everyone present understood how terrifying the Heat-Flame Zone truly was; before the Flowing Flame Sandland opened, anyone daring to penetrate it would surely face death without a whole corpse, even those of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would not survive.

The disappearance of a layer had stirred all of Dark Star into an uproar; no one knew what had occurred to cause such a change in Flowing Flame Sandland. Immediately after, the Lingxiao Sect took control of it.

Now, at Yang Kai's words, they had an answer.

It was hard not to believe!

Look across the Star Domain — besides the Emperor, who else could possess such capability?

For a moment, Yang Xiuzhu and the others believed Yang Kai's words to about eighty percent; the remaining twenty percent of doubt was merely cautiousness.

"May I ask... what is Sect Master Yang's relationship with the Emperor...?" Lin Yurao's eyes gleamed as she asked carefully.

“If I were to say she’s a kindred confidante… would you believe me?” Yang Kai chuckled slyly.

"Heh..." Yang Xiuzhu's face twitched and he gave a series of strained laughs.
