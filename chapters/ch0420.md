## Chapter 420 — This Child Is Beyond Saving

Before Yang Kai’s residence, Huo Xingchen acted like an uninvited guest, flaunting a rude and overbearing demeanor. Not only did he cause Yang Kai’s brows to furrow, but the young man standing opposite also showed displeasure, letting out a cold snort.

Huo Xingchen chuckled mockingly and was about to say more, but Yang Kai grabbed his clothes and flung him far away.

Midair, Huo Xingchen executed an elegant hawk roll and landed smoothly. Pinching his nose, he dared not complain, wearing an embarrassed expression.

Seeing this, the young man’s gaze involuntarily shifted to Yang Kai. The martial artists standing behind him whispered among themselves.

“I am the one you seek,” Yang Kai said coldly, fixing his gaze on the newcomer.

The young man’s expression flickered slightly, but his eyes still gleamed with wildness and defiance. He looked at Yang Kai challengingly without moving and said in a detached tone, “Greetings, Young Master Kai!”

“Who are you?” Yang Kai found it rather interesting. No wonder Qiu Yimeng said this person’s attitude was strange; there was definitely something off.

The way he showed up seemed like he wanted to ally with him, having brought many martial artists along with four boxes of supplies. Yet his expression revealed reluctance, as if he was being forced.

Yang Kai couldn’t recall where he had seen this person before.

“Xiang Tianxiao,” the young man answered in a deep voice.

“Xiang Tianxiao?” Yang Kai frowned slightly, suddenly realizing his surname. Recalling some matters, he raised an eyebrow and smiled slightly: “What is your relationship to Xiang Chu?”

Xiang Chu was encountered months ago at Taifang Mountain. He was the eldest son of the prestigious Xiang Family and the future heir.

Back then, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng jointly pressured Yang Kai, but unexpected aid arrived from the Yang Family’s Blood Servants. Yang Kai planted two feathers from the Golden Feather Eagle to incriminate others and cornered Xiang and Nan’s families, leaving four Divine Roaming Realm experts each crippled of an arm; Nan Sheng even lost two fingers.

Those two had high status. Yang Kai couldn’t kill them rashly and let them go, but before leaving, he told them he expected a genuine show of sincerity in Zhongdu within three months.

Now it seemed this Xiang Tianxiao was related to Xiang Chu, explaining the sources of these martial artists and the supplies.

“He’s my eldest brother!” Xiang Tianxiao replied calmly.

As expected, Yang Kai nodded slightly and swept the martial artists with a beaming smile: “Is this your Xiang Family’s sincerity? Not bad, I’m quite satisfied!”

Xiang Tianxiao slowly shook his head: “You don’t have such a grand face yet. All these people are the Xiang Family’s sincerity, and these four boxes belong to the Nan Family!”

“That’s fine! I don’t mind. The people may be a bit lacking, but these things are still useful,” Yang Kai chuckled.

These two top-tier great families each contributed either personnel or supplies. It seemed they feared news of their attempt to kill Yang Family’s direct descendants would spread, so they swallowed their pride and made amends.

A trace of disdain surfaced in Xiang Tianxiao’s eyes, his lips curling in a cold smile: “Your tone is arrogant! I have no interest in your grievances with my eldest brother, but if you want me to help you in the succession war, first show me your strength!”

“Haha. You want to fight him?” Huo Xingchen suddenly laughed loud, staring mischievously at Xiang Tianxiao. Interest flickered in his eyes as he shook his head: “Second Young Master Xiang, no offense, but fighting with him isn’t wise.”

Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly beside him, watching Xiang Tianxiao with amusement.

Both had fought Yang Kai before. When she sparred with Yang Kai, he was only at the Third Stage of the True Essence Realm and already matched her evenly, even slightly surpassing. Now Yang Kai was at the Eighth Stage of True Essence Realm, while Qiu Yimeng had just advanced to the First Stage Divine Roaming Realm, and still wouldn’t claim to be able to defeat him.

As for Huo Xingchen, that night’s encounter was a nightmare.

Though he was the only heir of one of the Eight Great Families and wildly indulgent in recent years, he was still gifted and had consumed countless heaven-and-earth treasures. His strength was not weak, and he carried many exquisite treasures.

Yet all that foundation was taken down by Yang Kai in a single encounter, leaving no time to react, which revealed Yang Kai’s overwhelming power.

Huo Xingchen didn’t believe Xiang Tianxiao could defeat Yang Kai in combat.

Among the young generation, only Liu Qingyao of the Liu Family might stand a chance. No one else dared to think so.

Xiang Tianxiao took in the expressions of Huo Xingchen and Qiu Yimeng and felt a chill in his heart.

With his insight, he could see their strength. Though he didn’t recognize them, their youth and prowess marked them as members of the Eight Great Families. Their silent demeanor and tone revealed much.

So Yang Kai was formidable?

Looking Yang Kai over again, Xiang Tianxiao shook his head. He could not gauge Yang Kai’s true strength. The young Yang Family scion stood there with true essence calm and undisturbed, his spirit perfectly contained. Either his power was immense or he relied on a treasure to conceal it.

Xiang Tianxiao could not tell if he was genuinely strong or bluffing; only combat would reveal the truth.

Now having no retreat, Xiang Tianxiao raised his voice: “If you only defeated my eldest brother because of those two Blood Servants, that means little. If you want my genuine help, you must defeat me first.”

Huo Xingchen sighed, walking over to Qiu Yimeng, saddened: “This child is beyond saving!”

Qiu Yimeng nodded solemnly in agreement.

Hearing this, Xiang Tianxiao felt a flicker of anger. The four Divine Roaming Realm experts behind him glanced at Huo Xingchen with displeasure, as if he should not belittle their Second Young Master.

Yang Kai’s eyes gleamed sharply as he frowned: “Seems your eldest brother didn’t tell you everything about that day.”

From Xiang Tianxiao’s few words, Yang Kai quickly pieced together some issues.

“If your eldest brother doesn’t tell you, shouldn’t your cousin Nan Sheng have told you?” Yang Kai said with a strange smile, veiled with deep meaning.

Qiu Yimeng’s long lashes flickered, recalling rumors she’d heard, and she looked at Xiang Tianxiao with sympathy.

Xiang Tianxiao’s expression turned severe as he snorted coldly: “Hearing isn’t believing. Seeing is believing. If you want to fight, then fight. If not, I’ll leave now. These people will stay and serve you. Your feud with the Xiang Family ends here.”

Yang Kai shook his head: “A headless snake—I have no use for that!”

Without Xiang Tianxiao, those martial artists would have little impact. Clearly, they were loyal followers of Xiang Tianxiao.

Walking a few steps forward calmly, Yang Kai extended a hand toward Xiang Tianxiao and beckoned slightly.

Such disdain enraged Xiang Tianxiao, but he took a deep breath, suppressing his anger and resentment.

In an instant, his aura steadied, and he fixed a cold gaze on Yang Kai.

This swift composure impressed Yang Kai. When facing an enemy, the greatest hazard was agitation. Martial artists often tried to provoke each other verbally to stir mistakes, as only with calmness could one exert full or even transcendent strength.

Xiang Tianxiao’s ability to regain composure in a breath showed remarkable inner strength.

“Second Young Master, be careful!” the Xiang Family martial artists retreated hurriedly. A Fourth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert warned solemnly.

“I know!” Xiang Tianxiao replied sternly.

With that, he motioned his hand, and a wild, azure-bladed saber suddenly appeared.

A Heaven-Grade treasure!

Grasping the blade, Xiang Tianxiao’s demeanor changed abruptly, becoming fiercely arrogant. His eyes brimmed with confidence, as if none could block his strikes.

Without speaking or indicating further, Xiang Tianxiao suddenly swung his treasure saber. Instantly, a torrent of blade light erupted, gathering into a deadly swarm, ferociously sweeping toward Yang Kai.

“Is this a sneak attack?” Huo Xingchen asked in surprise.

Qiu Yimeng ignored him; Yang Kai had already permitted the move, so why waste words? This Xiang Tianxiao was indeed as straightforward as rumors claimed.

Moreover, his strength was considerable—at the Ninth Stage of the True Essence Realm!

Her beautiful eyes moved rapidly, curious to see how Yang Kai would counter this attack. Though she knew Yang Kai was strong, it had been long since they fought. She wondered how much he had grown.

As the storm-like blade light rushed in, Yang Kai remained standing with a pale expression, seemingly not even planning to dodge. His hand extended forward, and at the moment the blade drew near, he precisely pulled back and pushed forward.

A fierce, surging true essence burst from his palm, a large, visible hand seal meeting the blade light.

Boom!

An explosive roar broke forth, energy wreaked havoc.

The blade light and hand seal collided and vanished without trace.

Amid the dust, Xiang Tianxiao had already closed in wildly. On the saber’s tip surged an azure energy sphere, chilling and awe-inspiring, his momentum like a rainbow soaring through the sky.

The energy sphere was as large as a millstone—vicious, ferocious, filled with killing intent, containing the power of thunder and lightning.

With the power of thunder, Xiang Tianxiao’s speed seemed near its limit. His charge left a long afterimage trailing behind.

Thunder Saber Flash!

This was Xiang Tianxiao’s killing move, unstoppable and indestructible. Under this attack, opponents typically suffered total defeat.

The Xiang Family martial artists smiled faintly, eyes full of expectation, eager to see how Yang Kai would endure such a heavy blow.
