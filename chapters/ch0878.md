## Chapter 878 — No Problem Then

After half a day of bustle, the disciples in the Sacred Tomb all filed out.

Yang Kai sealed the Sacred Tomb once more and summoned several elders and An Ling'er together.

Sensing he had something to say, everyone silently watched him, not uttering a word.

"I have something to tell you." Yang Kai frowned slightly as he chose his words.

"If the Saint Lord has something to say, speak plainly; we are all ears!" Xu Hui chuckled, puzzled why Yang Kai looked a little troubled.

"As long as it isn't leaving the Sacred Land or abandoning the Saint Lord position, name it and we'll agree." Yu Ying interjected with a smile.

"Exactly! Exactly!" The elders nodded in unison, wary of Yang Kai suddenly shirking his duties like he had years before—back when he had been utterly irresponsible and showed none of the bearing expected of a Saint Lord.

"That won't happen." Yang Kai let out a small laugh, then hesitated a moment before speaking gravely: "Put it this way—before I met you, I once encountered a group of people when my strength was still very weak. Because of certain special circumstances they were sealed inside a Small Xuan Realm; they begged me to find a way to free them and promised to serve me for life."

“Oh?” Xu Hui raised his brow. “To have made such a promise back when the Saint Lord was still weak—if it wasn’t just empty words, then it must mean they had already seen the Saint Lord’s potential. Which of the two was it?”

Xu Hui looked uneasy about the disposition of the people Yang Kai described and began to inquire.

"They weren't speaking lightly. While you were hiding in the Sacred Tomb these past years, I freed them a few months ago, and true to their word they have faithfully followed me and obey my commands."

"Well then, they're not bad at all." Cheng Yuetong pursed her lips in a faint smile. "Keeping one's word is trustworthy—does the Saint Lord intend to absorb them into the Sacred Land?"

Her remark put the idea into the others' minds. They all looked at Yang Kai with curiosity.

"They can't be absorbed into the Sacred Land... I only want to find one of the Nine Peaks for them to live on. What do you elders think?"

"Can't be absorbed?" Xu Hui frowned, then relaxed. "If they're the Saint Lord's people, it's only natural for them to live within the Sacred Land. It's vast—finding a place for them is no trouble..."

"Indeed..." Luo Sheng and Meng Tianfei nodded in agreement with Xu Hui.

"Don't be too quick to agree—I'm not finished. Hear me out before deciding!" Yang Kai smiled and continued, "There are roughly a thousand of them."

"That's not a small number, but the Sacred Land can accommodate them." Xu Hui nodded slightly. "What about their strength? How strong are their top experts?"

"Five of them are in the Saint Realm!"

"What?" The elders' eyes widened as An Ling'er covered her mouth, her delicate eyes trembling.

When Yang Kai had been weak, the others assumed those who pledged service had been weak too, otherwise they wouldn't have made such vows so easily.

In their speculation, the thousand or so were probably from some fallen sect or minor clan; having a few Transcendent Realm fighters among them would already be impressive.

But they hadn't expected Yang Kai to say that five among them had reached the Saint Realm!

That number falls just short of Nine Heavens Sacred Land by a hair...

"Saint Lord, you aren't joking, are you?" Xu Hui asked incredulously.

"Do I look like I'm joking?" Yang Kai's expression turned solemn. "Of those five in the Saint Realm, three are of the Second Stage and two are First Stage!"

Everyone was dumbstruck, frozen in place.

Three Second Stage Saint Realm experts and two First Stage—though numerically one short of Nine Heavens Sacred Land's roster, if conflict broke out their power could easily slaughter the Sacred Land's experts!

Xu Hui and the others instantly understood why Yang Kai had come so earnestly to consult them.

They couldn't be sure of that group's disposition—if a conflict ever arose with the Sacred Land, Xu Hui and the others would have no means to withstand them.

The joy of leaving the Sacred Tomb was instantly replaced by heavy worry.

"Moreover, they're not ordinary people..." As if the elders' shock wasn't enough, Yang Kai added in a low voice, "They are demons!"

"Demons?" Yu Ying couldn't help but cry out.

Cheng Yuetong's pretty face went pale in an instant.

Xu Hui remained silent, but everyone could see the horror and hesitation running through him.

After revealing so much, Yang Kai didn't know how they would answer.

"Think it over carefully. If you truly cannot accept them in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, tell me and I'll find them another place to settle," Yang Kai said indifferently, not forcing them, waving a hand. "For now, finish arranging your disciples' affairs—I told you this so you could be mentally prepared."

Everyone stared at Yang Kai, not moving a muscle.

"Don't be so conflicted. If not in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, I have another place to put them." Yang Kai grinned, reading their unease.

This had been expected of him.

Xu Hui suddenly snapped awake, his face grave. "Saint Lord, may I ask plainly—do these demons truly obey you fully, or are they arrogant, only feigning obedience to escape that Small Xuan Realm, and will break free when a future opportunity arises?"

"You don't need to worry about that." Yang Kai smiled proudly. "When I give a command, they dare not disobey!"

The elders' expressions all shifted.

Xu Hui let out a long breath and relaxed. "Then there's no problem. You are the master of the Sacred Land; it's your decision who to settle here. We elders can only advise, not decide. That you consulted us at all is a great courtesy..."

Yang Kai grinned and cast a glance around at the others.

Luo Sheng, Shi Kun, Meng Tianfei, Yu Ying, and Cheng Yuetong all had no objections. Though some worry showed, they looked at Yang Kai with trust.

"Then I'll thank you on behalf of those demons." Yang Kai nodded seriously. "The Sacred Land has nine peaks—they only need one. They'll provide their own supplies and need no support; I'll ensure they restrain themselves and won't clash with Sacred Land disciples."

"Has the Saint Lord chosen which peak?" Xu Hui asked.

"The one with the Reflecting Moon Pool."

Because of the Reflecting Moon Pool, that peak grows bitterly cold on moonlit nights; those who once lived on or beneath it moved away, making it the only peak among the Nine that people avoid.

The ancient demon clan's robust constitutions should handle living there fine, as long as they don't settle too close to the pool.

There are also many existing houses there, saving them the trouble of building anew.

"Won't they resent being placed there? Should we pick another peak?" Xu Hui asked, worried.

"No matter. The conditions in that Small Xuan Realm were far worse—being able to live there will satisfy them," Yang Kai chuckled.

"I see..." Xu Hui said no more.

After hearing that the demons had already come into the Sacred Land, Xu Hui immediately expressed his desire to meet them.

Since everyone would be living among the Nine Peaks, even if not of the same faction, a friendly acquaintance could ease future troubles.

Above all, both the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and that group of demons are under Yang Kai's power.

With that commonality, Xu Hui believed that if no major problems occurred, most issues could be smoothed over.

Leaving Meng Tianfei and Shi Kun to arrange the disciples, Xu Hui and the others followed Yang Kai back to the main hall.

The hundreds of alchemists and artificers and the ancient demon clan waited quietly; though Yang Kai had been gone half a day, the demon clan remained orderly, merely looking around and causing no trouble.

As host, Xu Hui immediately welcomed the arrival of Li Rong and the others.

Li Rong and her companions returned the greeting with smiles; after small talk both sides found the others pleasant and not as difficult as imagined.

Especially Xu Hui, who thought Li Rong was considerate—she had none of the stereotypical demonic bearing and seemed more like a refined lady from a great family or big sect.

He couldn't help feeling a spark of interest.

Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong took a strong liking to Han Fei as well; as women of comparable beauty, Han Fei's slightly higher cultivation and cool temperament made them feel there was much to learn from her.

Finding common ground, the parties chatted happily.

Yang Kai was left aside, looking idle.

After some conversation, Li Rong suddenly said, "By the way, we recently captured someone—apparently she was a previous Saintess of your Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Our lord calls her Saintess Nan!"

"Saintess Nan?" Xu Hui exclaimed and glanced around. "Where is she?"

Li Rong clapped, and a demon brought the bound Saintess Nan forward.

Seeing the former Saintess's pitiful state, Xu Hui and the others' eyes reddened with sorrow.

An Ling'er burst into tears and staggered over, collapsing onto Saintess Nan and sobbing bitterly.

The previous Saintess had been very close to the current one; Saintess Nan had always treated An Ling'er like a daughter. Tragically, after Saintess Nan's death she personally slew three other Saintesses, and An Ling'er had nearly met the same fate.

Reencountering her now, An Ling'er could not restrain her grief.

Xu Hui quietly wiped his eyes and turned his head away.

Li Rong and the others seemed touched as well, giving a small sigh.

After a while Yang Kai stepped forward and patted An Ling'er's shoulder. "What to do with Saintess Nan is up to you."

An Ling'er nodded repeatedly, choking on her words, leading the hollow-eyed Saintess Nan away.
