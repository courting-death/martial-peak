## Chapter 2305 — I Do Not Agree

In the inner hall, Luo Jin held the bride’s silk ribbon, smiled faintly, and turned to walk inside.

At that moment, an elderly man with graying hair rose from the table to the left of Yang Kai and the others, smiling as he walked to the couple and stopped before them.

The music of pipes faded, the drums fell silent, and the atmosphere instantly became solemn and dignified.

The old man smiled and said, “To be able to witness this marriage for the City Lord, this old man is greatly honored.”

He paused briefly before continuing, “On this auspicious day, the two of you are joined in matrimony, forging a bond between your families. May you share deep affection as husband and wife, grow old together in harmony, and treat each other with mutual respect. Do you both agree?”

Luo Jin smiled and said, “I agree!”

The old man nodded and turned to the bride, asking, “And you?”

The bride’s delicate body trembled slightly, and a pleasant voice came from within the phoenix coronet: “I…”

As the words left her mouth, Yang Kai’s expression changed and the unease deep in his heart intensified. He was certain—absolutely certain—that he knew this voice!

Before he could listen more closely to discern whose voice it was, a trembling, delicate shout suddenly rang out from somewhere in the inner hall: “I do not agree!”

With those words, the entire hall was shocked.

Everyone turned toward the source of the voice, not knowing which bold soul dared to make the City Lord lose face in front of so many experts.

Luo Jin’s expression grew furious, and he turned to shout in that direction, “Who is so audacious!”

His face twisted with rage, nearly contorted. Today was the grand ceremony of taking a concubine, a joyous occasion, and he had never imagined someone would ruin it at such a critical moment. A thick killing intent surged in his heart.

His eyes flashed coldly as he scrutinized the direction of the voice, snorting, “What? You have the guts to ruin this Lord’s happy event, but not the courage to step forward and admit it?”

Immediately, a guest beside him shouted, “Stand out and apologize to the City Lord. Maybe you’ll be spared. But if you stubbornly resist, this day next year will be your death anniversary!”

Luo Jin said, “Today is this Lord’s joyous day. This Lord does not wish to take lives. If you come out obediently, this Lord will not make things difficult for you!”

As his words fell, someone suddenly stood up from the crowd.

That person was completely wrapped in a black robe, making it impossible to see her face, but judging by her height and figure, it was clearly a woman.

“Seize her!” As soon as Luo Jin saw this person stand up, he waved his hand sharply.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh—several martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion immediately rushed toward her.

The woman stood there, seemingly unafraid. Just as those people were about to reach her and capture her, she suddenly lifted the black scarf from her head, revealing her true face.

All eyes widened in shock; the crowd was dumbfounded, faces filled with disbelief.

“Ah?”

“This…”

“Young Lady?”

The martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion who had rushed at the woman were originally fierce and ready to seize her and take her away for punishment, but upon seeing her face, their expressions changed dramatically. They withdrew their moves in midair, landed awkwardly, and were left completely stunned.

Because they realized that the one who had ruined the concubine ceremony at this crucial moment was none other than the Young Lady of the City Lord’s mansion—Luo Bing!

Qiu Yu suddenly stood up, staring at Luo Bing in astonishment. He never imagined that Luo Bing had been in the inner hall all along, and that she would disrupt the City Lord’s ceremony.

He had parted with Luo Bing only yesterday; she had seemed perfectly fine then. He couldn't understand why, after just one night, she would act this way.

For a moment, the inner hall was silent as a grave. Everyone looked at Luo Bing with strange expressions, not knowing what she was up to.

“Bing’er!” Luo Jin’s body trembled as he stared wide-eyed at Luo Bing. “You… how could you…”

Before he could finish, he seemed to realize something and said in a deep voice, “Who bullied you?”

He saw that his precious daughter’s eyes were red and swollen, clearly from crying for a long time, and her voice was hoarse. That was why he hadn’t recognized her voice at first.

Instinctively, he thought someone had bullied Luo Bing.

Qiu Yu, standing to the side, quietly swallowed, afraid that Luo Bing would say his name. He thought Luo Bing was acting this way because of him.

“No one bullied me.” Luo Bing pressed her red lips together.

“Really no one?” Luo Jin narrowed his eyes and asked in a deep voice.

“Really, no one.” Luo Bing shook her head, then after a moment of silence said, “Father, your daughter has a request.”

Luo Jin sighed and said, “Whatever it is, let’s talk about it later. Go back to your room and rest for now.” Deep down, he was annoyed that Luo Bing had been so thoughtless, embarrassing him in front of so many powerful people. He just wanted to finish the ceremony and then ask Luo Bing what was going on.

Unexpectedly, Luo Bing had no intention of obeying. She just shook her head and said, “No, I must ask you now. If I wait any longer, it will be too late.”

“Bing’er!” Luo Jin shouted angrily in a low voice.

Luo Bing shuddered instinctively, a little afraid, but she kept a resolute, pleading look as she faced her father.

Seeing her like this, Luo Jin knew he couldn’t win against her. He could only sigh, turn to the guests with a smile, and say, “Please forgive me, everyone. My daughter has been spoiled by this Lord, so she’s a bit unruly. I hope I haven’t ruined your enjoyment.”

Upon hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but relax. They thought to themselves that they had long heard Luo Bing was doted on by the City Lord, but they hadn’t expected it to be to this extent—she even dared to cause a scene at the concubine ceremony.

They all expressed that it was no problem, each acting as if they were very considerate of Luo Jin.

Only then did Luo Jin look at Luo Bing and say, “Go ahead, what do you want from your father, and why choose this moment… If it’s too difficult, see how I’ll deal with you later!” Though his words sounded threatening, he wore a smile, clearly showing his indulgence.

The guests also let out good-natured laughter, praising the City Lord’s fatherly love.

Luo Bing bit her red lips, pointed to the person beside Luo Jin, and said, “Father, I want to ask you to let her go!”

As soon as she spoke, the inner hall, which had just regained a bit of festive atmosphere, once again fell into a strange silence. Many guests opened their mouths in disbelief, while others realized that today’s matter might not be easily resolved. For a moment, everyone was uneasy, secretly watching Luo Jin’s expression.

Luo Jin’s smile instantly froze and slowly faded, his face turning so cold it seemed to be covered in frost, and his eyes gradually filled with anger.

After a long while, Luo Jin said, “Bing’er, go and rest. You must be too tired!”

He had thought his daughter’s objection to the marriage was just a way to bargain for some difficult condition, and he was fully prepared for that. But now it was clear that wasn’t the case—Luo Bing truly opposed this marriage.

How could Luo Jin agree? No matter how much he doted on Luo Bing, he would never let the bride go in front of everyone. If he did, how could he keep his dignity? How could he maintain his authority? In the future, he might not even be able to rule Tianhe City and remain its City Lord.

“Father, please agree!” Luo Bing pleaded tearfully.

“Insolent!” Luo Jin shouted, glaring at Luo Bing with bitter disappointment. “It seems I spoiled you too much in the past, making you lose all sense of propriety. Get back to your room! Without my permission, you are not to take a single step outside!”

“Father…” Luo Bing burst into tears. “She’s not willing! Why must you force her? Please let her go!”

“Hiss…”

The sound of people drawing in cold breaths echoed through the hall.

Although everyone knew in their hearts that almost none of Luo Jin’s concubines had married him willingly, such things were best kept to oneself. No one would say it out loud. But to bring it up in public was a different matter entirely.

And the one to say it was actually Luo Bing!

All the martial artists in the inner hall felt their hearts skip a beat upon hearing this, as if a violent storm was about to break out, filling them with unease.

“Let her go, and I’ll always stay by your side, be filial, and listen to you. I’ll never cause trouble again, I promise.” Luo Bing continued to cry and plead.

Luo Jin’s face twisted, turning ashen as he shouted, “What nonsense are you spouting!”

Luo Bing said, “I’m not talking nonsense. I know who she is, and I know why she’s marrying you. Just let her go.”

Luo Jin roared, “What are you all standing around for? The young lady has lost her mind! Hurry up and take her away and look after her!”

At his command, the martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion, who had been at a loss, sprang into action and rushed toward Luo Bing.

But just then, someone who had been sitting beside Luo Bing suddenly stood up, grabbed her by the neck, and, with a single pale eye, glared coldly at the crowd. “If anyone comes closer, I’ll kill her!”

The martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion were shocked and once again fell from midair in a panic.

The other guests who had come to offer their congratulations widened their eyes again, never expecting that today’s ceremony would be so full of hidden currents and twists.

“It’s him!” Yang Kai frowned, looking at the one-eyed, disheveled man holding Luo Bing hostage, a thoughtful look on his face.

He remembered that the day before at the restaurant, he had encountered this man, who seemed to be called Chai Hu. It was because of a conflict between him and another group that Yang Kai had left the restaurant early.

He hadn’t expected that this Chai Hu would sneak into the ceremony and, in front of everyone, take the Young Lady of the City Lord’s mansion hostage.

However… this man was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. Even with Luo Bing in his grasp, his fate was likely grim.

Thinking this, he glanced at the bride who had been standing beside Luo Jin. Ever since he first saw her, he had felt something strange. Now, looking again, he saw her delicate body trembling, as if she were struggling with something.
