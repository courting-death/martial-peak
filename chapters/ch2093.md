## Chapter 2093 — Suppression

With the Heart-Demon Oath complete, the man surnamed Fu coldly extended a hand toward Qin Chaoyang.

"Where are the Source Crystals?" Qin Chaoyang asked with a stern face.

The man surnamed Fu sneered. "A mere ten million — are you afraid this Lord can't pay?"

As he spoke, he drew a Spatial Ring from his bosom, tidied it briefly, then tossed it to Qin Chaoyang.

Qin Chaoyang took it, carefully searched through it, and after confirming everything was in order he produced a blank jade slip, poured his Divine Sense into it, and engraved the complete formation method for the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation.

After a moment, he handed the jade slip back to the man surnamed Fu.

He suppressed the excitement in his chest, took the jade slip, examined it briefly, and a look of delight instantly appeared on his face as he laughed and treasuredly put the jade slip away.

The outcome of this transaction clearly pleased him greatly, and he even temporarily forgot the earlier irritations.

"Everyone, we need to speed up. If we don't move now we'll be surrounded," Yang Kai suddenly warned in a deep voice.

Their Divine Senses swept out and found that during the time they'd dawdled countless demonic creatures had already converged from all sides, layer upon layer densely enclosing them.

"Just a pack of jumping jesters!" Duan Yuanshan snarled, his hands suddenly flashing in formation signs.

Those inside the array were bound by its power; at Duan Yuanshan's motion, everyone was compelled to move in unison.

After a moment the massive Divine Spirit's form widened its maw, and the surrounding world’s abundant water-element aura frantically converged; in the blink of an eye a huge water sphere formed at the dragon head.

With a muffled roar from Duan Yuanshan, the Divine Spirit phantom seemed to be controlled by some force and opened its mouth to spit.

The enormous water sphere turned into a streak of white light that shot straight forward, smashing everything in its path; countless demonic creatures touched it and immediately perished, turning to ash.

A safe passage more than a hundred zhang long appeared directly ahead.

Duan Yuanshan said nothing and charged forward first; the others followed closely behind.

The city lord was probably disgusted and angry at the man surnamed Fu, but he couldn't really fall out with him, so he could only vent his rage on the demons.

As the formation shifted, the demonic creatures that had been gathered around them were swept into motion, surging forward with suicidal abandon and relentlessly bombarding the array with all manner of attacks.

Looking out, outside the enormous Black Tortoise figure the ground was covered with dense multitudes of demonic creatures.

Yet they still could not stop the group's advance.

After roughly half an hour, they finally reached the place where the original mine pit had been.

Although the surrounding thousand-li area was filled with pitch-black Demonic Qi, in one spot the Qi was even denser. There a black column of energy shot up to the heavens, linking earth and sky with terrifying momentum — pure Demonic Qi poured from that point and spread outward.

They needed no reminder — the moment they saw that pillar of pitch-black energy soaring into the sky, everyone knew at once it was the source of it all, and almost certainly where the seal was hidden.

Duan Yuanshan led everyone and hurriedly rushed toward it.

The closer they drew to the source, the faster they felt their Origin Qi draining from their bodies. Alarmed, everyone produced Spiritual Pills and shoved them into their mouths to keep their powers functioning.

Suddenly Duan Yuanshan halted his steps and knit his brows, staring ahead.

Less than ten zhang away, a line of a dozen or so powerful presences stood quietly, as if waiting for a long time.

The instant the group stopped, those dozen people roared as one and charged like the wind.

Their violent power nearly reached the Dao Origin Realm in intensity; the only thing lacking was the manipulation of Law Power.

"They're people from the Jiang Family!" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and shouted sharply.

"Scum, die!" Duan Yuanshan changed his hand seals and the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise phantom raised a forepaw and swept forward violently.

Ker-pow...

That paw directly swept two figures away; they exploded into a mist of blood in midair, their bones gone, while the others nimbly dodged.

Those Jiang Family Void King Realm demons had their Demonic Qi enhanced; in some respects they almost matched Dao Origin Realm strength, but how could they contend with people forming a great array?

Under the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation, the Origin Qi of seven Dao Origin Realm practitioners merged as one, among them two were experts at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

The power of the Black Tortoise phantom's paw was effectively seven people striking at once.

"It's that brat Jiang Lin!" Du Lishen, positioned on the left side of the formation, saw a demon rush close, its body covered in Demon Marks and its eyes pitch-black; with a glance he recognized him as Jiang Lin, head of the Jiang Family.

Jiang Lin had apparently lost his sanity; the brutal death of the clan elders hadn't cowed him, but instead stoked his bloodlust. Demonic Qi rolled around his body as he unleashed various exquisite secret arts to batter the formation.

His frenzied state startled Du Lishen, and his hand seals flickered and slowed.

If one in the formation misstepped the whole array could be affected; his momentary hesitation nearly threw everyone else off rhythm.

The man surnamed Fu flew into a rage, stared daggers at Du Lishen and barked, "Old man, do you want to die? If you dislike living so much, this Lord won't mind granting you death!"

"Mistake, mistake!" Du Lishen was inwardly distressed but forced a smile, hurriedly suppressing his fear and readjusting his stance and state of mind.

A dozen or so Void King Realm experts, transformed into demonic beings, could each hold their own against a Dao Origin Realm warrior; elsewhere they'd be a formidable fighting force, but before the Black Tortoise Seven‑Section Formation they were still laughably like children.

The Divine Spirit's phantom moved in broad, sweeping arcs, utterly unstoppable—no complex techniques, only its forepaws swinging again and again under the group's control. One after another the charging demons were struck flat, ground into crimson pulp that exploded into a mist of blood.

The battle took only a dozen breaths; the Jiang Family's dozen high-ranking members were basically annihilated, with only Jiang Lin barely surviving.

Unexpectedly, he launched no further attack. Instead he shrouded himself in the roiling Demonic Qi, releasing savage howls as he drove the boundless horde of demonic creatures, trying to halt the group's advance.

But what use were those demonic beasts of uneven strength? Charging forth, they would only serve as cannon fodder.

Blood flowed like a river and corpses piled in heaps along the way.

After spending a full hour, they finally pushed to the very source from which the Demonic Qi leaked.

The earth lay shattered, and the original mine shafts had largely collapsed after the Demonic Qi erupted everywhere. With no other option, they fought off the fiends as they hastily dug pits and plunged into the underground mine tunnels.

Yang Kai had seen the spot where the seal lay on his last visit, so it was not unfamiliar now. Following his lead, the group threaded through the twisting mine tunnels, spending nearly another half hour before they finally came upon the place where the seal was hidden.

After clearing away the rubble, the stone wall bearing the seal finally came into view.

"Found it?" Duan Yuanshan asked joyfully.

"This is definitely it." Qin Yu, who had been kept protected in the middle, gazed at the stone wall covered in Demon Marks, her beautiful eyes brightening as she nodded.

She had once vaguely seen this pattern in Jiang Chuhe's Sea of Consciousness; it was a very ancient seal and she only had a slight understanding of it.

Fortunately the seal was only damaged at one corner; with her ability she could barely repair it.

"Hurry up and start!" the man surnamed Fu impatiently urged.

Hua Qingsi pursed her lips and smiled, "What is Your Excellency afraid of?"

The man surnamed Fu shot her a sideways glance and snorted. “It is not that this Lord fears anything. But these trash lack the strength—if this drags on, you and I might endure, but can they?”

"How perfectly reasonable of you," Hua Qingsi giggled in reply.

Everyone listened with sour faces.

After all, they were all Dao Origin Realm experts; within ten thousand li of Fenglin City they weren't world-shattering but at least were top figures — and now they were being called trash by this man surnamed Fu.

Each of them was inwardly boiling with resentment but couldn't show it, so they cursed the man surnamed Fu in their hearts.

"I need you to temporarily disperse the Demonic Qi here, or I can't mend the seal!" Qin Yu suddenly spoke.

The damaged spot in the seal was the very source of the leaking Demonic Qi; it was purer and denser than anywhere else, and Qin Yu's Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivation could not withstand it!

"Suppress it with the Divine Spirit's power!" Qin Chaoyang shouted.

They all understood and nodded.

With hand seals shifting, they moved and the enormous Divine Spirit phantom directly pressed down upon the seal.

The surging Demonic Qi seemed obstructed and immediately slowed, ultimately unable to leak.

But everyone's faces turned extremely ugly.

Because after the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation restrained the damaged seal spot, each person felt their Origin Qi gushing out like a breached dam.

The rate of power consumption was like recklessly releasing a forbidden secret art; almost no one could endure it.

Several First Stage Dao Origin Realm warriors immediately went pale.

"Yu'er, how long do you need to repair this seal?" Du Lishen asked bitterly.

Qin Yu did not look back; various precious materials for repairing the seal constantly manifested in her hands as she said, "At the very least, half an hour!"

"Half an hour..." Du Lishen's face darkened further.

"This is the decisive moment; victory or defeat rests on it — everyone must not be careless!" Duan Yuanshan roared to bolster morale.

Hearing that, they could only grit their teeth and force their powers onward while continuously stuffing themselves with various restorative Spiritual Pills.

"A bunch of trash!" the man surnamed Fu sneered and showed disdain; his expression was leisurely and relaxed.

He had the powerful cultivation of Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm; the quality and reserves of his Origin Qi were nearly an order of magnitude greater than Du Lishen and the others, so naturally he had few worries.

"Your Excellency, did you study the Black Tortoise Seven‑Section Formation closely?" Hua Qingsi suddenly asked out of the blue, a teasing smile flickering across her pretty face.
