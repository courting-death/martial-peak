## Chapter 2020 — Welcoming the Bride

Hearing the old matriarch speak, Yang Kai nodded and said, “If it can be like that, all the better.”

Although he felt indifferent toward the Dao Origin Fruit, it was not the same for other Void King Realm warriors; once the news spread, it would very likely draw countless Void King Realm cultivators to swarm him, and might even draw the attention of experts from the Dao Origin Realm.

The Dao Origin Fruit meant little to a Dao Origin Realm expert personally, but which such expert did not have juniors and descendants?

The old matriarch added, “Young Brother, if you will not abandon us, you might stay with my Zhang Family a few days so this old matriarch can fulfill the duties of a host.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and considered for a moment; he thought it would be unwise to leave now. Though he had no deep ties with the Zhang Family, he had made certain promises with Zhang Gaoxuan, and now that the Zhang Family faced a crisis, if he left and Lu Baichuan brought men to strike, the lone household might be unable to hold out.

It would be better to let them state their demands now and so settle one matter on his mind.

As he thought this, a strange sound suddenly came to his ears.

“What is that noise?” the beautiful woman’s expression shifted as she tilted her head to listen.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “It sounds like drums and gongs.”

The beauty was stunned and puzzled, but the old matriarch seemed to recall something. She rose to her feet and shouted in a deep, furious voice, "Lu Baichuan, you little bastard—how dare you bully others so!"

Although Lu Baichuan’s cultivation surpassed hers, the old matriarch outranked him by a generation, so there was no impropriety in her scolding him so.

The beauty’s face changed, and she said, “Could that old thief—”

The old matriarch cast a glance at the girl who had remained at her side and served faithfully, gently patting the girl’s hand. "Do not fear, your great-grandmother is here. If the Lu Family tries to seize you, great-grandmother will not allow it."

The girl was obedient; though she vaguely understood what was happening, she did not seem overly frightened and merely shook her head, whispering, "Great-grandmother, if Ruoxi can help the family avert disaster, let Ruoxi go."

“What nonsense!” the old matriarch snorted and slammed her cane down hard. “Your grandfather, your father and brothers were all killed by the Lu Family; the grudge between the Lu Family and my Zhang Family is one that cannot be erased. How could great-grandmother push you into the fire? Rest assured—great-grandmother will protect you today.”

From their conversation Yang Kai immediately understood that the girl who had served the old matriarch was none other than Zhang Ruoxi, the one the Lu Family sought.

Yang Kai had already probed her cultivation with Divine Sense; she was only at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, not yet reaching the Origin Returning Realm—pitifully weak. Judging by her age she was about fourteen or fifteen—an age and strength common in the Star Realm.

Though pretty and delicate, she was by no means a femme fatale capable of toppling a nation; there seemed nothing particularly special about her to warrant the Lu Family’s extreme concern.

Perhaps she was simply a random pawn the Lu Family chose to swallow the Zhang Family.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, feeling puzzled.

At that moment the old matriarch turned her gaze to Yang Kai and said solemnly, "Young Brother, this old woman has an immodest request..."

Yang Kai nodded and replied, “Please speak, Old Madam.”

The old matriarch said, “Young Brother, your cultivation is not ordinary, but Lu Baichuan’s realm is comparable with yours; if a true fight broke out, it would not benefit you. This old woman does not ask you to slay him for Zhang Family vengeance; I only ask you to act to ensure the Zhang Family’s safety this time, and I would be grateful beyond words.”

“Is this a request?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

"Indeed!" the old matriarch nodded earnestly. The middle-aged beauty and Zhang Ruoxi likewise looked at Yang Kai with pleading expressions. After all, the Zhang Family’s two strongest fighters were only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, and the old matriarch herself had been grievously injured the last time she used a secret Yuan Qi technique, leaving her unable to stand against the Lu Family now.

If Yang Kai walked away, the Zhang Family would truly face calamity.

Yet because Lu Baichuan’s cultivation equaled Yang Kai’s, they could not be sure Yang Kai would honor any agreement with Zhang Gaoxuan and step forward to shelter the Zhang Family; after all, which cultivator would needlessly offend someone of equal realm?

Everyone was anxious, yet none dared to speak further.

"This request..." Yang Kai chuckled lightly, sending the three in the hall's hearts to their throats. "I can agree to that."

The old matriarch breathed a sigh of relief, and the beauty and the girl visibly relaxed, their eyes full of gratitude.

"But Old Madam, I happen to be at the Zhang Family now and can ensure your safety this time. If next time I am not here and the Lu Family comes again, what then? I cannot live here forever," Yang Kai said calmly.

The old matriarch frowned and solemnly sighed, “We can only take it one step at a time.”

Yang Kai said in a low voice, “Has the Old Madam considered cutting the root?”

"Cut the root!" The old matriarch’s murky eyes suddenly brightened. She asked in a steady voice, "Young Brother, are you confident? The Lu Family has many supporters; it is not only Lu Baichuan."

“We can try,” Yang Kai said, narrowing his eyes.

The old matriarch paused and reappraised him, hesitating before she said, “If you truly can do so, the Zhang Family will regard you as a benefactor. Sooner or later we will burn incense and kowtow morning and evening, praying to the heavens for your lifetime safety.”

“That will not be necessary,” Yang Kai smiled. “But we should renegotiate the terms.”

“Terms?” The old matriarch was surprised and then forced a wry smile. “What could a young brother want? I fear the Zhang Family has little that would meet your eye.”

“You misunderstand, Old Madam; I am not asking for anything,” Yang Kai said, waving his hand. “Only that this carries some risk for me, and I dislike being bound by agreements. So listen: if I truly can eradicate the Lu Family, then my promise with Zhang Brother is fulfilled and you must not trouble me with any further requests. How about that?”

“Young Brother means...” the old matriarch pondered.

“Either I protect you this time and that counts as one request fulfilled, leaving you two remaining requests; or I avenge the Zhang Family and that counts as all three requests at once—choose for yourselves.”

The old matriarch rejoiced at once. “I naturally choose the second. If Young Brother truly can avenge the Zhang Family, we will not trouble you further, and it will count as your fulfillment of the promise with Gaoxuan. Furthermore, I will reward you greatly.”

“Good. Then it’s decided.” Yang Kai grinned, rising. “Await news.”

With that he was already walking toward the door.

“Young Brother, allow me to stand guard for you!” the middle-aged beauty volunteered.

As her words fell, Yang Kai’s figure flickered—and he had already vanished without a trace.

"Quick, help me and look!" the old matriarch cried excitedly as Zhang Ruoxi hurriedly supported her. They hurried toward the gate.

Outside the Zhang Family manor the scene was bustling.

A procession, beating drums and gongs, swept grandly to the manor gate; eight men carried a bridal sedan, and many chests covered with red cloth followed.

The sight was evidently a wedding procession, and the covered chests were naturally the bride price.

At this moment, the procession had come to a halt outside the manor. At its head stood a middle-aged man with a neatly trimmed mustache, appearing to be in his forties. His eyes were bright, his aura deep and restrained—clearly a cultivator of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Behind this middle-aged man stood a youth dressed in a bright red wedding robe, smiling broadly; his cultivation was not high, only the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and he appeared sixteen or seventeen—intoxicated with happiness.

The wedding party halted before the lone Zhang Family household.

The Zhang Family watched the mustached man and the youth in the red robe like they were facing fire; every face was furious and their internal strength swelled—but they dared not act rashly given the disparity in power.

“Lu Baichuan, you actually have the face to come to my Zhang Family!” the fat warrior who had attempted to ambush Yang Kai had gritted his teeth and shouted at the mustached man. “Our Zhang Family has kept friendly ties with your Lu Family for generations, yet you act with wolfish ambition and cruelty, murdering my Zhang Family disciples. This hatred will not be left unavenged!”

Lu Baichuan glanced coolly at the fat warrior and said, “Young one, I am here to receive the bride today; I will not quarrel with you. Let Aunt Cheng come out to speak.”

“You actually call for Aunt Cheng?” the thin warrior scoffed. “Lu Baichuan, today I learned something—your Lu Family’s face is thicker than a city wall. Impressive, very impressive.”

“You are courting death!” Lu Baichuan was, after all, a Third Stage Void King Realm expert; how could he endure being openly barked at by two juniors of the Origin Returning Realm? He roared, “And before whom do you dare speak so arrogantly? No respect for your elders!”

As he spoke he reached out to seize the thin warrior.

The thin warrior’s face changed as he tried desperately to draw on his Saint Yuan and Shi field while retreating to avoid Lu Baichuan’s grab.

But no matter how hard he tried, he could not summon his power.

The gap between Origin Returning Realm First Stage and Void King Realm Third Stage was enormous; frankly, Lu Baichuan could, with a casual finger, crush the thin warrior to death.

Seeing the hand almost seize his head, the thin warrior howled madly, “Lu Baichuan, even if I die today, I will not let you have it easy!”

As he spoke he triggered a spirit formula; the suppressed power within him surged tumultuously.

“Self-Destruction?” Lu Baichuan’s eye twitched and he snorted, “You intend to self-destruct in front of me? Very well—today is Tao’er’s great wedding, let’s add a little color to the celebration. Boy, give me your life!”

He waved his big hand and instantly formed a black curtain that shaded the thin warrior.

The thin warrior’s face fell; he realized he might not even have time to self-destruct.

Just then, the thin martial artist suddenly noticed a flash of light bursting from within the darkness shrouding him. In the next instant, that black curtain shattered like a mirror, and at the same time, the crushing pressure bearing down on him vanished without a trace.

Overjoyed, he took several quick steps forward instead of retreating; the power within him raged wildly, as if it were about to burst open at any moment.
