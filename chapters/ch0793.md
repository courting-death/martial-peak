## Chapter 793 — He Likes Power

Divine Sense seeped through every inch of his skin, probing the changes in the True Yuan within his flesh; after breaking through to the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm, Yang Kai felt both the vigor and the purity of his True Yuan had risen considerably.

Moreover, his physical body had become noticeably firmer through those life-or-death fights.

His Divine Sense strength had also improved: nourished by the Warm Spirit Lotus, this breakthrough brought a gratifying increase to Yang Kai’s Divine Sense cultivation.

He felt that his current Divine Sense, if collided head-on, would not be inferior to that of a First Stage of the Saint Realm.

Coupled with the ferocity and inscrutability of the Divine Sense Fire, any ordinary First Stage Saint Realm expert who truly chose to fight him in that manner would likely suffer a crushing defeat.

He also possessed the Court of Divine Battle, a bizarre Secret Treasure that could forcibly drag an enemy’s spirit body into that space and engage them in a Divine Sense duel.

All these reserves and advantages greatly bolstered Yang Kai’s confidence; the string of misfortunes and setbacks over the past year had entirely become fuel and opportunity for his strengthening.

Any expert gains insights unobtainable in ordinary times through battles of life and death; only at the edge of crisis and death can one clearly perceive things that are otherwise inaccessible.

It could be said that every successful martial artist has experienced life and death and acquired a fearless spirit, enabling them to become stronger through adversity.

Those pampered in a greenhouse who grow up without hardship may do well if life is smooth, but a single setback can leave them broken and fade from sight.

Yang Kai belonged to the former kind of person forged by hardship; since he began cultivating his path has been strewn with thorns, and having stood countless times between life and death, he surpassed his peers in cultivation.

Everything he now possessed was earned step by step by Yang Kai himself. It was not luck, nor a coincidence.

Realizing this, Yang Kai’s state of mind changed subtly; he grew more confident and believed that, given time, he would stand atop the peak of martial cultivation and look down upon all beings.

Gathering his excited spirit, Yang Kai continued to examine his body.

To his surprise and delight, the golden blood flowing within him seemed to have increased significantly.

Li Rong and Han Fei had once said that if one’s blood all turned golden, it would be tantamount to possessing Demon God’s Blood, granting one the overwhelming powers of the Great Demon God.

The Great Demon God was merely a legend—acknowledged by humans, demons, and monsters of that era as the unmatched strongest; in his time no one dared challenge his authority.

The golden Demon God’s Blood had limitless uses; because he bore that blood, Yang Kai’s body was so sturdy and his recovery so abnormal.

Yang Kai could hardly imagine how powerful his flesh would become if every drop of his blood turned gold.

The Ancient Demon Clan’s toughness was also due to carrying fragments of the Demon God bloodline; compared to them, his lineage was undoubtedly purer and more authentic.

Slipping his consciousness into the Black Book Space to communicate with the Divine Tree, Yang Kai’s body autonomously ran its cultivation methods and began to train.

As Yang Kai grew, the Divine Tree likewise evolved; with his permission it drew a single drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye each day. With such aid its intelligence became much clearer, its wisdom steadily increasing—now it not only conversed clearly with Yang Kai, but sometimes would even pose questions of its own.

Yang Kai cared for it as though it were a child and answered its questions wholeheartedly.

Time flew; it had been more than two months since Yang Kai arrived at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Over that time he grew accustomed to life in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; aside from being unable to leave easily, his treatment had been quite favorable.

Great Elder Xu Hui and the others seemed to receive him with the highest honors: they supplied abundant spirit-grade pills and medicines for his cultivation, sent several attractive young female attendants to look after him, and even provided many Sacred Land martial skill manuals for his study.

Yang Kai accepted nearly everything offered—except he never touched those attendants—and spent his days hunched over cultivation, quickly and steadily consolidating his Transcendent Realm's Second Stage.

Xu Hui and the others dropped in from time to time to chat with him, never bringing up succession to the Sacred Lord’s position; on freer days they would take Yang Kai out to tour the Nine Peaks and display the Sacred Land’s beauty and deep heritage.

It was obvious they hoped to win him over by such means, to have him willingly accept this place; their intentions were sincere.

Unfortunately, after two months they had seen no success, which made Xu Hui and the others uneasy and gradually less patient.

On one of the Nine Peaks, atop its lofty summit in a magnificent hall, the Sacred Land’s elder protectors gathered, led by Xu Hui, and were discussing matters.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land boasted a powerful line-up: the late Old Sacred Lord had top-tier Third Stage Saint Realm cultivation; Saintess Nan and Great Elder Xu Hui were at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; among the remaining elders Yu Ying, Luo Sheng, Shi Kun, Meng Tianfei, and Cheng Yuetong were all of the First Stage of the Saint Realm, with Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong being women.

A force that possessed so many Saint Realm experts was exceedingly rare across the world.

"Great Elder, what attitude does the future Sacred Lord hold now?" Yu Ying—an elegant middle-aged beauty in a scarlet dress that accentuated her mature curves, with crystal-smooth skin and a pair of bright phoenix-like eyes—asked, lightly parting her vermilion lips.

At her question everyone turned their concerned gazes toward Great Elder Xu Hui.

Xu Hui frowned and sighed, "Still the same—he never gives a straight answer. Although I’ve deliberately not pressed the matter recently, I can sense he has no intention of becoming the Sacred Land’s lord."

"That boy is indeed interesting…" Luo Sheng looked shocked and clicked his tongue in wonder. "Everyone in the world wants to become the master of our Nine Heavens Sacred Land to rise in a single step—why does he act so indifferent, as if we’re forcing him?"

"Watch your words; that is the future Sacred Lord, not some kid!" Cheng Yuetong, in a pristine white dress and cool demeanor, glared at the indiscreet Luo Sheng. He gave an awkward smile and glanced at Great Elder Xu Hui; seeing no sign of anger, he relaxed somewhat.

"Still, it’s odd," Cheng Yuetong frowned. "Could it be he looks down on our Sacred Land?"

"Impossible!" Shi Kun snorted. "Although our old Sacred Lord fell, we still remain a preeminent force; in both reputation and strength we surpass the Tianxiao Sect—how could he look down on us?"

"It’s possible," Xu Hui suddenly said gravely. "I’ve shown him around the Nine Peaks and laid out our foundations; though he expressed praise, there was no sense of being truly impressed. To him, it seems all of this is just passing smoke and mirrors."

"Ah, this boy… the future Sacred Lord behaves so?" Luo Sheng coughed and stared in astonishment.

"Great Elder, do we know what he likes? We could cater to his preferences," Meng Tianfei suggested. "The Sacred Land cannot be without a Lord. Since the old Sacred Lord’s passing nearly a year ago, it would have been one thing if the future Sacred Lord had not been found, but now that he is here and still no succession ceremony has taken place, the disciples gossip constantly. If this continues, the disciples will lose heart in cultivation, which is not good."

"Indeed," Yu Ying nodded. "If we knew what he liked, we could keep him. At the very least we must give him a sense of belonging to the Sacred Land; only then can we ensure the prosperity of the place."

"He should like power!" Xu Hui’s eyes flashed with a gleam. "From my observation over this period, his pursuit of strength is unwavering and singular. Everything else seems like mere diversion; he barely cast a glance at the attendants I arranged!"

"Are there men who don’t like beauties?" Luo Sheng almost popped his eyes out, bewildered.

"Do you think everyone is like you, obsessed with women?" Yu Ying snorted coldly, displeased, and Luo Sheng immediately felt embarrassed.

"Could it be he fancies the Saintess, and that’s why he behaves so?" Cheng Yuetong suddenly proposed. When facing a woman he admires, which man would dare to act mischievously? They usually present themselves as heroic to attract attention. If Yang Kai’s behavior stemmed from feelings for Saintess An Ling’er, then his attitude would be understandable.

All present were veterans and nodded in understanding.

Xu Hui smiled bitterly, "It’s not that—quite the opposite. It seems our Saintess has some affection for him, but he treats the Saintess only as a friend."

"Poor Ling’er…" Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy.

They had all watched An Ling’er grow up and naturally felt some fondness for her.

"The future Sacred Lord is no ordinary person…" Xu Hui suddenly sighed. "I have never seen such a young Second Stage Transcendent—have any of you?"

Everyone shook their heads.

"The Tianxiao Sect has produced an extraordinary talent; what puzzles me is that I never heard of him before. Such a promising youth should have risen to fame across the continent, yet he remained unknown—truly strange. Moreover, he managed to flee with the Saintess from the clutches of the demon general Xueli; I can hardly imagine how he pulled that off."

"He even escaped a brush with death at the hands of Saintess Nan…"
