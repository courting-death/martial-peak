## Chapter 1839 — Bullying the Weak

Zixiao Star was the primary star of Purple Star, one of the Star Domain's three great powers.

Alongside Hengluo Commerce Guild’s Shuiyue Star and Sword Alliance’s Sword Star, it stood among the three greatest Cultivation Stars of the entire Star Domain. In terms of the richness of its Spiritual Qi, the abundance of its resources, and even the overall standard of its cultivators, these three stars far surpassed all others by a wide margin.

If Cultivation Stars were divided into ranks, Tongxuan Continent would undoubtedly sit at the lowest level, Dark Star could be placed in the middle ranks, but neither could in any way compare to these three Cultivation Stars.

Purple Star City covered an incalculable area, vast and boundless; magnificent buildings rose in rows, and broad streets intersected everywhere. Along the roads, every sort of shop glittered with wares, and cultivators flowed through like fish in a river, too numerous to count.

This was the Purple Star headquarters.

For any Purple Star cultivator, this city signified honor and belonging.

Purple Star City sat atop an excellent Earth Vein, so the Spiritual Qi within the city was no less abundant than that of great sacred mountains and rivers. The inner city was especially resplendent with Spiritual Qi and formed the very core of Purple Star; non-important Purple Star personnel were forbidden to enter.

One day, a streak of light shot from a far distance and suddenly halted when it was about a hundred zhang from Purple Star City; the light dispersed to reveal the figure of a young man.

It was Yang Kai, dusty and weary from his journey.

Departing from the Lingxiao Sect, although he had used two transmissions through the Great Space Array and saved a great deal of time, Yang Kai still spent half a year flying alone through the Star Domain to reach Zixiao Star.

His purpose in coming was simple: the Star Emperor Token within the Purple Star Treasure Vault.

Naturally, any additional gains would be welcome; after all, it was unlikely the Purple Star Treasure Vault contained only one token.

He sent out his Divine Sense to take a slight measure, and Yang Kai was secretly struck by the Purple Star City's grandeur; a city of that scale could only have been built and sustained by a great power.

The city walls rose to about thirty zhang, bathing in a purple glow—what material they were cast from he could not tell, but Yang Kai clearly felt an aura of potent restraining formations.

One could imagine that if an outside foe came to cause trouble, Purple Star City could activate its city array to withstand a powerful enemy.

However, Yang Kai reckoned no fool would be brazen enough to come here and court disaster.

"So this is Purple Star City?" Yang Kai murmured to himself, squinting at the distance.

The next moment, a fawning voice sounded beside his ear: “In reply to Young Master Yang, this is indeed our Purple Star’s main headquarters—Purple Star City. Young Master Yang’s speed is truly astonishing; it feels like barely any time has passed, and yet you’ve already arrived here.”

The voice was exceedingly faint and transmitted via Divine Sense, so no one but Yang Kai could hear it.

It was Zi Donglai, hiding inside the Soul-Fixing Bowl.

Yang Kai's willingness to barge alone into the Purple Star headquarters was not recklessness; his chief reliance was the information Zi Donglai could provide. With Young Master Zi Donglai as a guide, and so long as he acted cautiously, entering the Purple Star Treasure Vault should not be difficult.

Of course, that was on the condition the brat did not pull any tricks.

After some time together, Yang Kai had discovered that although the brat's talent was not bad—he could be mentioned in the same breath as Xue Yue and Gu Jianxin—his character was severely lacking. The present Zi Donglai had lost his former swagger and seemed like a mangy dog clinging to life: suppliant and obsequious toward Yang Kai, daring not to show the slightest defiance.

“As expected, quite the bustling place. Those warships in the sky—are they all Purple Star’s?” Yang Kai looked up toward the heavens. In the distant air floated no fewer than twenty or thirty warships. Though they were too far away for him to gauge their grade, the fact that they dared hover above Purple Star City meant they were certainly not ordinary vessels.

"Most of them, I suppose," Zi Donglai answered proudly. "What Young Master Yang sees is merely the tip of the iceberg. Purple Star trades with big powers throughout the Star Domain; perhaps some warships of other forces have come as well."

Yang Kai lightly nodded. "Conceal your aura; I'm going in."

"Yes!" Zi Donglai obediently replied and hastily retreated into the Soul-Fixing Bowl.

Yang Kai stepped forward and walked toward the towering gate, which yawned like the maw of a giant beast—its scale matched the city wall and inspired dread. First-time visitors to Purple Star City would be cowed by the gate's imposing might and feel insignificant, afraid to act wantonly within the city.

Outside the gate, a long queue stretched out; many cultivators waited to enter.

Yang Kai did not wish to stand out, so he quietly took his place at the very back of the line.

As time passed, people continually paid a number of Saint Crystals to receive specially made passes and walk into the city.

Suddenly, an indignant shout came from the front: "Sir, why did you only charge that person a hundred Upper-Level Saint Crystals to go in a moment ago, but you demand one thousand from me? That doesn't seem fair, does it?"

"Fair?" came a cold snort. "I am the gate guard—my word is the rule. Pay the Saint Crystals or get lost!"

"You Purple Star cultivators use your strength to bully people like this? I won't submit!" the man snapped.

The cultivators in line displayed displeasure, but since this was the city's territory, no one dared speak up.

Yang Kai glanced over and saw the man quarreling with the gate guard was a middle-aged fellow of about thirty, dressed plainly. Yang Kai swept him with Divine Sense and found the man possessed only the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. He did not know where the man hailed from, yet he was making a scene over one thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals.

Yang Kai silently shook his head, feeling the man's situation looked grim.

"Using strength to bully people?" Suddenly an aged voice sounded. Everyone turned to see the old man who had been sitting nearby suddenly grin with malice; his face was leathery with wrinkles, he walked with trembling steps, his hands tucked in his sleeves as if he might die at any moment, and even his eyes were a dead, ashen grey—sight of him made one's heart pound.

Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm! Yang Kai's heart stirred—Purple Star was indeed deserving of its name; guarding the gate was a cultivator at the Third Stage.

The old man spoke as he stepped forward several paces, looking coldly at the troublemaker. "Well said. Today I will let you understand what it means to use strength to bully people!"

With those words, he suddenly closed the distance to the middle-aged man and, to the man's horror, struck him on the head with a palm.

The middle-aged man, only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, could not withstand an unexpected strike from someone at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

He cried out and tried to retreat.

But the old man's hand seemed to possess enormous suction, pinning him utterly in place. A surging pulling force manifested; the middle-aged man screamed as, plainly visible, streams of refined energy flowed from the crown of his head into the old man's withered hand and were absorbed.

Everyone outside the gate staggered back in shock, their faces drained of color.

"No, spare me, elder! I'll pay the Saint Crystals!" the middle-aged man cried.

"Now you regret it? Where were you earlier?" the old man remained unmoved and instead urged his Saint Yuan more fiercely.

In just three breaths' time, the middle-aged man was sucked down to skin and bone and collapsed, utterly drained of life. The old man's face flashed an unusual flush, as if he had suddenly grown a decade younger; he looked invigorated.

Silence fell outside the gate; every cultivator felt a chill run through their body.

After finishing, the old man returned as if nothing had occurred and resumed his meditation with closed eyes.

"Much obliged, Deacon Min," the gate guardian said with profuse bows. Then his expression hardened and he barked, "This man was a scout sent by an enemy power to infiltrate Purple Star City. Deacon Min detected and killed him on the spot to serve as an example. Carry him off—throw him into the grave mounds outside the city."

Two Purple Star cultivators immediately stepped forward and quickly carried away the ghastly corpse.

Everyone knew the man's words were nonsense, but no one dared contradict them.

"It's getting dark—if any of you still intend to enter, hurry. Once the gates close at sunset, no one gets in,” the gate guard called out. “Heh, and as for what happens outside after dark… I’m sure you all know.” After saying this, the gate guard ignored the crowd.

The cultivators in line changed their expressions and hurried forward to pay their Saint Crystals and enter, as if some great danger truly lurked outside at night.

Although the middle-aged man's death aroused a sorrow that made them feel the fate of prey, none dared oppose the stronger fist; that fellow had shown no discretion—making a fuss over one thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals was courting death.

The city gate guards seemed to have no fixed rules when collecting Saint Crystals—they quoted prices however they pleased. When a pretty girl came along, they’d even throw out a few teasing remarks, and if they managed to sneak a touch or two, they’d often let her pass for free.

A few whom he disliked ended up paying a great many Saint Crystals.

With prior lessons as a warning, no one dared voice complaints.

Soon it was Yang Kai's turn.

The gate guard glanced up at Yang Kai and snorted, "Five thousand!"

Yang Kai frowned at the figure—this was the highest price he had heard—but he did not want unnecessary trouble. He reached into his Spatial Ring and, with a swipe, filled the guard's space before him with Saint Crystals.

The gate guardian looked at Yang Kai in surprise; he had not expected such compliance.

Toying with the pass in his hand, the gate guard chuckled, "Friend, five thousand is merely the production cost for this pass. If you plan to remain in the city long-term, you'll have to pay another ten thousand Saint Crystals."

"Heh heh..." Yang Kai could not help but laugh, thinking they took him for a rich fool.
