## Chapter 783 — Killing Intent

The earth was dark red, soaked with blood that had swallowed countless lives; pitted and scarred everywhere by battle—this was the Death Arena!

Demons who had heard insider news had long since waited in the stands; after watching several not‑too‑fierce deathmatches, a human wearing a mask slowly emerged from an underground passage.

In an instant, cheers surged like a tide.

Over these past months, Yang Kai had delivered thrilling, suspenseful battles one after another for these demons, and his name had already spread throughout Sand City.

And today's duel between Yang Kai and another expert was the final curtain‑call.

Rumor had it this opponent would be different from before—a master at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

Since the Death Arena opened, there had never been a contest with such a vast disparity in cultivation—fully two minor stages apart; to those unaware of the inside story, the outcome seemed already decided.

Yet for those who had witnessed Yang Kai's dozen‑plus battles, a sliver of hope remained that he might conjure another miracle!

It had nothing to do with racial animosity; it was simply that Yang Kai's performances were dazzling, sending their emotions on a rollercoaster of excitement.

“Is that the human kid who has won a dozen matches in the Death Arena, each time narrowly escaping death?” A Saint Realm expert squinted like a hawk and asked the person beside him in a low voice.

“Yes, Lord Feng Biao, his performance is truly remarkable—even many of my demon elite disciples don't measure up to him by a hair!” the man beside him replied at once.

“Hmph, after today he will be a corpse!” Feng Biao snorted coldly, his expression showing he did not wish Yang Kai to remain alive.

“What my lord says is right… after all, his opponent this time isn’t like the ones before.” The man nodded repeatedly, then grew uneasy and lowered his voice: “But, my lord, he was cultivated by Lady Xueli—if we really kill him like this and Lady Xueli lays the blame on us…”

“She won't.” Feng Biao shook his head slowly. “This matter was ordered by Lord Gou Qiong. Yesterday I visited Lady Xueli's palace and discussed it with her; she personally agreed, she will not punish us!”

Hearing this, the man looked surprised, unable to fathom why Lord Gou Qiong cared so much about this human.

Only a very few knew the inside story—that Gou Qiong's son had been saved by Yang Kai—and Feng Biao had been dispatched to handle the matter. It was kept extremely secret, so the man could not understand the full reason.

Although Xueli and Gou Qiong were not on good terms, Xueli would not spread such rumors to undermine Gou Qiong; she would confront him directly with true force.

“My lord, Yu Mo is here!” the man suddenly whispered.

Feng Biao's eyes narrowed as he glanced aside; Yu Mo flew over from nearby with a smile, landed, and without ceremony sat beside him.

Both were Saint Realm experts under two demon generals who disliked one another, so naturally they were not on friendly terms.

The two met each other's gaze and immediately sparked a flash of mutual defiance.

“Yu Mo, long time no see!” Feng Biao greeted with a cold face.

Yu Mo smiled broadly. “Feng Biao, it's been a while. Seeing you still gets me riled up—I could kill you for it!”

“The feeling's mutual!” Feng Biao nodded slightly. True Yuan flowed slowly through him; his snake‑like eyes fixed on Yu Mo.

Yu Mo curled his lip and said, “I didn't come to pick a fight; I just have some questions to ask.”

“What questions?”

“From how you look, you seem supremely confident about today's match!”

“Hmph—asking what you already know!”

“The Death Arena in Sand City has gambling rules; if you're so confident, have you placed any bets? Once that fight ends you could net a fortune!”

“Do I need you to remind me?” Feng Biao's expression soured. “I've already wagered two hundred thousand Crystal Stones!”

Yu Mo whistled in admiration. “As expected of Feng Biao—what a wager! You're aiming to make a killing in Sand City.”

“Can't cover it?” Feng Biao sneered. “If you can't accept it you can retract—just apologize to me in front of everyone!”

“Don't be absurd. Sand City runs this business, so whatever amount is wagered must be honored; I only mean the chance is rare—why not play bigger?” He finished with a commanding look toward Feng Biao.

Feng Biao's expression hardened. He said in a low voice, “Go bigger?”

“Right—you can stake everything you own. I recall you have quite a number of Secret Treasures?”

Feng Biao frowned, eyeing Yu Mo suspiciously. “Why do you look like you have faith in that guy?”

“Who knows—he might win, he might lose. It's fifty–fifty; if you're going to gamble, it's about whether you have the guts!”

Feng Biao fixed him with a hard stare. Though he knew this longtime rival was provoking him, he couldn't suppress his temper and finally nodded: “Fine, I'll put up all my Secret Treasures!”

With that, he waved his hand and produced a radiant suit of armor, a polearm that radiated staggering energy waves, and a jet‑black measuring rod, handing them to Yu Mo.

All three were Saint‑Grade Secret Treasures, each priceless; together they were worth an incalculable sum—Feng Biao's most trusted and often‑used relics. If he lost this bet, his combat strength would be greatly diminished.

After surrendering the three Saint‑Grade treasures, Feng Biao even unfastened the Spatial Pouch from his waist and handed it over with a cold laugh: “If we're going to play, let's play thoroughly—what do you say?”

Yu Mo's eyes flickered; he smiled, accepted them without further words, and turned to leave.

Feng Biao did not stop him, nor did he demand any written guarantee; though they disliked one another, they kept verbal agreements.

A moment later Yu Mo returned to Xueli's side.

“All arranged?” Xueli asked softly as she looked down at Yang Kai standing in the center of the Death Arena, waiting quietly for his opponent.

"Mm. Feng Biao has staked all his assets." Yu Mo nodded slightly, frowning. "My lady, are you really that confident in that boy? Frankly, although his previous performances were surprising, this time I truly don't think much of his chances—he's very likely to die here. His death itself doesn't matter, but with Feng Biao wagering so much, if the boy dies it will bring trouble to our Sand City."

“I don't know!” A trace of bewilderment passed Xueli's beautiful eyes as she shook her head.

Yu Mo was astonished.

As one of the four great demon generals and one of the realm's foremost experts, Xueli naturally had a sharp eye for people—usually unfailing—but this time she seemed unable to see through the situation.

“I'm also gambling. From the surface it looks like the kid is doomed, but…”

Saying this, Xueli glanced at An Ling'er, who had been guarding by her side, and smiled slightly: “That little girl has never once shown much worry.”

Yu Mo couldn't help looking at An Ling'er and found it to be true; even knowing Yang Kai would face a strong enemy today, she remained composed.

Xueli had evidently gleaned some information from An Ling'er.

“I asked her several times what the kid's true level was, but she wouldn't answer— the more she refused, the more curious I became!” Xueli reached out and touched An Ling'er's face, startling the girl.

“Tell me, has he ever fought such an opponent before?” Xueli suddenly demanded in a sharp, low voice.

An Ling'er's lovely eyes blanked for a moment, then flickered with struggle; the scenes of being pursued by Saintess Nan and fighting many Yang Clan experts in the Small Xuan Realm flashed through her mind.

An Ling'er looked pained and shook her head repeatedly.

Xueli sighed helplessly: “Her will is strange—she seems to have cultivated some very formidable technique.”

“But from her behavior it seems the kid truly has faced such masters before and survived; otherwise the girl would not be so at ease.”

“Mm.” Xueli nodded slightly. “Just watch—if he doesn’t die this time, then before long he will surely become the most dazzling figure on the entire continent; given time, he might even reach the level of a Demon Lord and dominate the region!”

Yu Mo's body trembled. “My lady, you truly hold him in such high regard?”

“He has that potential!” Xueli said decisively, her eyes suddenly flashing with coldness and killing intent.

“A pity he isn't one of our kind—if he were, we might have cultivated him properly.” Yu Mo, having followed Xueli for years, knew what she was thinking and felt a pang of regret.

With such talent and the way he grew stronger through adversity, a seed like that, if not crushed early, would eventually pose a serious threat to the Demon Race.

Whatever happens today—victory or defeat—the outcome was already decided, for the lady had set her heart on killing him.

Watching Yang Kai standing straight below, calmly waiting for his opponent's entrance, Yu Mo felt genuine pity.

After a long moment, a figure finally emerged from the passage opposite Yang Kai; he walked as if at leisure but moved with terrifying speed, and in a blink he appeared not far from Yang Kai.

He wore plain black clothes, his frame immense, his expression cold; long black hair draped his shoulders, his eyes like icy stars, chilling and soul‑seizing.

A murderous aura surged from him; his breath was long and enduring, and his True Yuan was unusually pure—he clearly outmatched an ordinary Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm cultivator.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed, a chill tightening his chest.

From a single glance he knew this opponent was no pushover; this time he truly might have to risk his life.

Although he possessed the Soul-Devouring Worm and did not fear opponents below the Saint Realm, this circumstance was different: before so many demons he could not use the Worm; he had to defeat this enemy by his own hand.

Moreover, he very much wanted to test the results of his recent training.
