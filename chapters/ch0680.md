## Chapter 680 — Why Didn't You Say So Earlier?

The Soul-Searching Technique could peer into another's memories, but it was far from complete, so unless absolutely necessary, Duan Hai and Xu Qi did not want to use it against Yang Kai.

They needed Yang Kai to cooperate voluntarily; besides, in their eyes he came from a remote backwater and was young, so he surely lacked deep guile.

But after a round of confrontation they discovered this youngster was a hard bone to chew—stubborn and unyielding; neither coercion nor bribe could sway him. No matter how they threatened or tempted him, Yang Kai sealed his lips about the Coffin-Bearer's secret and refused to utter a single word.

Duan Hai was speaking truthfully; he did not wish to offend a promising alchemist so readily. If possible, he hoped to absorb Yang Kai into the Leiguang Divine Cult.

If Yang Kai joined, Duan Hai would have ample opportunity to extract information from him.

But once he saw that Yang Kai had no such inclination, Duan Hai decisively made his move.

After all, Yang Kai was bound to leave sooner or later and could never be of service to Leiguang; offending him mattered little.

"What are you after the Coffin-Bearer for? What could you possibly gain from him?" Yang Kai asked Duan Hai coolly.

Duan Hai frowned, pondered for a moment, and said, "It is said the Coffin-Bearer guards an earth-shattering secret; whoever fathoms it can command enormous power."

Yang Kai chuckled; there was no smoke without fire. Though Duan Hai did not know precisely what the Coffin-Bearer guarded, in a sense he was not entirely wrong.

The Ancient Demon Clan was indeed a tremendous power. Yet that race was not one anyone could enslave.

"If Honored Guest Yang knows, could he reveal a little?" Duan Hai asked, his gaze burning as he looked over.

Yang Kai shook his head. "You're asking the wrong person. I truly don't know."

"Senior Brother!" Xu Qi, clearly losing patience, barked and looked toward Duan Hai for instruction.

Duan Hai nodded slightly and said gravely, "Honored Guest Yang, our apologies."

Xu Qi sneered as he strode forward, his voice icy: "Refuse the offered wine and you'll drink from the punishment cup. Once I enact the Soul-Searching Technique, your soul may be harmed—you could be reduced to a fool! Pray for yourself."

Yang Kai feigned some panic at the right moment; Xu Qi saw it and grew even more pleased.

Standing before Yang Kai, Xu Qi brazenly placed a large hand over his head and let loose Divine Sense power on the level of a Second Stage Transcendent, surging out violently.

In an instant, Yang Kai's expression changed.

He had thought this was an opportunity—his True Yuan had been restrained—but in a contest of Divine Sense power, Yang Kai was confident he would not be inferior to anyone.

If Xu Qi's soul dared to storm into his Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai could make him pay with his life; even Saint Realm cultivators could not withstand the World-Ending Demon Eye of the Great Demon God, let alone Xu Qi at the Second Stage Transcendent.

If he killed Xu Qi, then performed the Demon God Transformation, there might be a chance to break through his physical seals; with only Duan Hai left at Transcendent Realm, Yang Kai had some confidence he could escape.

But when Xu Qi acted, Yang Kai discovered the other's soul did not pour into his Sea of Consciousness—instead Xu Qi's Divine Sense power wove into a formless whirlpool, producing a massive pulling force that sought to tear Yang Kai's Divine Sense from his mind.

Within the Sea of Consciousness, vast waves rose and the waters churned, becoming violently unsettled.

An indescribable pain struck him; Yang Kai's face twisted, veins bulged on his forehead, and his bones rattled.

It was a pain from the soul—thousands of times stronger than any physical pain.

"Hm?" Xu Qi was slightly surprised, sneering. "Don't delude yourself with resistance. The more you resist, the worse you'll suffer. Drop your Divine Sense defenses and let me extract your memories—you won't have to endure this torture."

His words carried an invisible force that tried to compel Yang Kai to act according to his will.

Sensing this, Yang Kai grew even more cautious.

"Stubborn fool!" Xu Qi snapped in fury and increased his Divine Sense output; the pulling force strengthened considerably.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense could rival that of a Transcendent Realm, but there remained a gap with Xu Qi. With Duan Hai watching hungrily nearby, if the stalemate continued they would succeed sooner or later.

Thinking this, Yang Kai abruptly stopped resisting; his Divine Sense power erupted, forming an invisible attack that surged toward Xu Qi.

Xu Qi laughed and mocked, "You're overestimating yourself!"

"Junior Brother, be careful!" Duan Hai's face changed as he shouted urgently. At that moment he suddenly sensed a hot aura spreading out; the heat filled him with a sense of danger, and he hastily retreated, widening the distance between himself and Yang Kai.

Whoosh...

A scorching, brilliant burst of sparks suddenly exploded in the void. The triumphant, ferocious look on Xu Qi's face froze; his features contorted in agony as he clutched his head and screamed.

"Divine Sense Fire?" Duan Hai's eyes went wide in disbelief as he stared at Yang Kai.

The scream lasted only a moment before Xu Qi recovered.

In that instant he had been unexpectedly scorched in his soul by Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire and had inevitably suffered some damage; fortunately his Divine Sense power exceeded Yang Kai's, or his end would have been dire.

Coming to his senses, Xu Qi was drenched in cold sweat.

He had nearly met disaster!

"Honored Guest Yang, you actually possess Divine Sense Fire?" Duan Hai's expression was complex as he stared at Yang Kai and asked in a low voice.

Yang Kai's gaze was cold, rife with malice and hatred as he glared at the two of them, but he did not answer.

"Why didn't you say so earlier?" Duan Hai looked utterly vexed. "If you had said you possessed Divine Sense Fire earlier, I would have...ah..."

He shook his head slowly and sighed.

Had he known earlier that Yang Kai was an alchemist with Divine Sense Fire, Duan Hai would never have so readily offended him in the hope of prying the Coffin-Bearer's secret from his mouth.

That secret was after all only a legend; whether the Coffin-Bearer truly guarded an astonishing treasure, who could say? Duan Hai had been gambling.

But an alchemist who possessed Divine Sense Fire was truly a tremendous asset!

In the present world, among alchemists the foremost was Elder Tianzang—his exalted standing came precisely because he possessed Divine Sense Fire.

Within the three races of Human, Yao, and Demon, Elder Tianzang enjoyed supreme prestige; whoever saw him treated him with utmost reverence.

Had he known Yang Kai also possessed Divine Sense Fire like Tianzang Elder, Duan Hai would have spared no effort to curry favor and would have done whatever it took to bring him into the Leiguang Divine Cult, even offering up the Grand Elder position if necessary.

What an alchemist with Divine Sense Fire represented was clear to the powerhouses across the continent.

In that instant Duan Hai was filled with remorse.

"Senior Brother, it's done now; it's unrealistic to make peace," Xu Qi said resentfully, staring at Yang Kai. After that small setback he no longer dared to casually use the Soul-Searching Technique—Divine Sense Fire was something he would not lightly touch.

Duan Hai glared coldly at Xu Qi, wishing he could strike this junior brother dead with a single blow!

Come to think of it, when he had invited Yang Kai back that day, Duan Hai had been pleased, believing Yang Kai had a bright future and intending to foster him. It was Xu Qi's instigation and persuasion that gave rise to his ill intent.

Now that matters had reached this point, there was no possibility of reconciliation.

"I didn't know he had Divine Sense Fire either," Xu Qi said sullenly. "If I had known..."

"There's nothing more to say." Duan Hai shook his head helplessly and asked the Honored Guest Yang, "You will not forgive what we've done today, will you?"

"Let me go and I'll pretend this never happened today. How about that?" Yang Kai's mouth curled into a subtle smile.

Duan Hai slowly shook his head, thrusting out several cords of energy that bound Yang Kai like ropes, and said regretfully, "We have offended you."

In a dungeon, Yang Kai was imprisoned.

The dungeon had been forged from a special ore through which mysterious energies flowed; occasionally intricate runes flickered within its walls.

This was a cell capable of holding Transcendent Realm cultivators; with Yang Kai confined here, Duan Hai and Xu Qi were not worried he would escape.

His True Yuan remained sealed. Yang Kai tried to break free several times but failed each time, and every use of his True Yuan sent stabbing pain through his entire body.

Though trapped, Yang Kai did not appear flustered.

He had experienced far worse—several close brushes with death—but each time he had found an opportunity to turn peril into safety and survive.

A way will present itself when the cart reaches the mountain; Yang Kai firmly believed this and waited patiently for the right moment.

Moreover, Duan Hai and Xu Qi had no intention of killing him. Upon learning Yang Kai possessed Divine Sense Fire, their attitude toward him had shifted subtly.

They now probably did not know what to do. Kill him and they felt reluctant; keep him and he'd be a persistent trouble.

Days passed, and Yang Kai lived in the dark dungeon, seeing no sunlight.

One day, with a heavy rumble the dungeon door was opened and light streamed in. Yang Kai squinted and peered out, his expression instantly amused.

A beautiful, tall figure slowly walked in and stood before the cell, her eyes watching Yang Kai with a complicated look.

Ji Meng!

After a long gaze, Ji Meng crouched and placed some items she had brought into the cell. "I brought you some food," she said. "Though these aren't necessities, I prepared them carefully; they should taste fairly good."

"Did Duan Hai tell you about me?" Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at her, a strange smile at the corner of his mouth.

"Yes." Ji Meng nodded.

"What did he want you to do?"

“To persuade you!” Ji Meng said in a low voice. “Within the Divine Cult, only I have any familiarity with you, so I had to come personally.”

“And how do you intend to do that?”

“By persuading you!”

"Fine then. Since you've come, I'll reluctantly agree. Go tell Duan Hai I will join the Leiguang Divine Cult," Yang Kai chuckled.

Ji Meng shook her head. "Even if you agree like that, he wouldn't believe it. Do you take him for a child?"
