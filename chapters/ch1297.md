## Chapter 1297 — Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade Platform

"These matters need not concern us, and even though they went inside, given their cultivation levels whether they can take the Sun's True Essence is another matter; why bother thinking about it," the female Corpse Soldier sneered.

"Indeed." The male Corpse Soldier chuckled low. "Is the Sun's True Essence so easy to take? Maybe those two will suffer a great loss and fall here without us lifting a finger; we only need to sit back and enjoy the show."

With that thought, the two Corpse Soldiers brightened. After concealing themselves they silently hid nearby, waiting for the spectacle to unfold.

Inside the cave, Yang Kai watched the scene before him and almost couldn't contain a laugh.

In this grotto, the stash was Saint Crystal and various rare ores!

Those Saint Crystals were all Upper-Level, piled into several small mounds, each over a dozen zhang tall; a sweep of the eye revealed that every little mound contained at least three to four million Saint Crystals.

In other words, this place stored tens of millions of Saint Crystals!

Earlier Yang Kai had been praying that if this trip could resolve Dragon Lair Mountain's current awkward situation it would be perfect—and now that wish had been fulfilled so easily.

Exchanging a look with Yang Yan, both saw deep delight mirrored in the other's eyes.

They didn't rush to scoop up those mountain-sized Saint Crystals; instead their gazes were drawn to a jade platform, snow-white and exuding waves of icy chill that made the entire secret cave feel bitterly cold—this platform was clearly no ordinary item.

On the jade platform were four Spatial Rings and a peculiar ore shrouded in a layer of energy film.

Approaching the platform together and examining it carefully, Yang Yan let out a suppressed whisper, "It's the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade!"

"Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. He asked urgently, "You aren't mistaken?"

"This is unquestionably Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade; I wouldn't be mistaken." She looked certain, and Yang Kai, confident in her sight, felt both joy and alarm.

Ice jade is already exceedingly rare, and Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade is rarer still; if fashioned into a personal Secret Treasure and carried about, it can help those who cultivate the ice-cold attribute better convert Spiritual Qi, increasing their cultivation efficiency.

Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade's uses aren't limited to that. When forging ice-cold Secret Treasures, adding some Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade can boost the treasure's power by a third and even release an ice-jade chill; that chill affects both the body and the soul, profoundly cold.

Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade is counted among the three profound jades; a fist-sized piece is a priceless treasure.

To find such a large slab of Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade here thrilled Yang Kai; what shocked him more was that the jade had merely been crafted into a platform to display four Spatial Rings and an ore.

The four Spatial Rings were nothing to worry about—likely placed here casually. That head-sized, unremarkable ore had to be extraordinary, otherwise it wouldn't be guarded by a formation.

Yang Kai glanced at Yang Yan and noticed her expression had turned serious; she was scrutinizing the ore without speaking, as if even she couldn't be certain what it was, which made him even more astonished.

"Let's look at the four Spatial Rings first." Having waited long with no reaction from Yang Yan, Yang Kai said and reached out to take the rings.

Probing inward with his Divine Sense to inspect them, Yang Kai nodded lightly.

As he had expected, the four Spatial Rings stored Saint Crystals and rare ores, split evenly; the Saint Crystals were enormous in quantity, while the rare ores were even rarer than those outside.

After tossing a ring to Yang Yan to examine, Yang Yan's face lit up: "Wonderful. With these I can forge the treasure I've been planning."

"What treasure?" Yang Kai asked, curious—he couldn't imagine what treasure would require so much material.

"I won't tell you yet; you might have to lend me your power when the time comes." Yang Yan giggled and handed the rings back.

Yang Kai glanced at her but didn't press. After stashing the rings, he looked at the strange ore wrapped by the formation on the jade platform and asked, "You can open that formation, right?"

"I can!" Yang Yan nodded. "But are you sure you want to? For some reason I sense a trace of danger from this thing."

"You sense it too?" Yang Kai was surprised; he had thought it was his imagination, but Yang Yan felt it as well, and he grew serious—anything that made him sense danger had to be exceedingly perilous, though equally priceless.

Yang Yan fell silent, staring at the head-sized stone; after a while she nodded: "Open it. Even if it's dangerous, we should be able to defend against it. It would be such a pity to let something like this go."

Saying so, she produced her tool for dispelling formations and scattered it around.

Seeing that, Yang Kai immediately grew wary and secretly urged his Saint Yuan to be ready to act.

After a moment's thought he beckoned and released the Stone Puppet, sent his Divine Sense to it, and gave it a command; the Stone Puppet darted to the mounds of Saint Crystals and ores, opened its mouth, and began devouring them.

One couldn't tell what wondrous structure its body possessed; though the Stone Puppet looked small and compact, its belly's capacity was infinite, and in the blink of an eye it swallowed half a little mountain.

Yang Kai had asked Yang Yan about this before; she told him the Stone Puppet had an innate talent to devour ores to evolve. Though most it swallows is later expelled as refined products, it still absorbs some, and those absorbed mineral essences become its growth capital.

Whatever traits an ore has, once absorbed those abilities can manifest within the Stone Puppet.

By sheer coincidence, the first batch of minerals the Stone Puppet swallowed after its birth were Ethereal Crystals—minerals with spatial power—which seemed to have formed a vast space within its belly, allowing it to swallow without limit; otherwise an ordinary Stone Puppet with the devouring talent wouldn't boast such enormous capacity.

As the Stone Puppet devoured Saint Crystals and ores there at great speed, Yang Kai stopped watching it and instead fixed his attention on Yang Yan's movements.

The formation enclosing the strange stone appeared very complex; even with Yang Yan working on it personally she couldn't break it quickly. Yang Kai, fearing an accident, quietly sent out his Divine Sense to probe the surrounding area.

Upon probing, he was taken aback.

In a secret cave they had looted earlier, two faint traces of Corpse Qi were hidden; though they were well concealed, under Yang Kai's powerful Divine Sense a few flaws showed, allowing him to detect them.

What gave Yang Kai some reassurance was that the two Corpse Soldiers were only at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and they had no intention of attacking, merely lurking motionless.

Yang Kai feigned that he had noticed nothing, watching their movements while focusing on Yang Yan's progress.

For Yang Kai, if he could take everything from here he would have achieved his goal; he could then tear open space and take Yang Yan away, and even if countless Corpse Soldiers were alerted he could still escape with ease.

In the past he wouldn't dare casually tear space while taking another person—ripping space was extremely unstable and could go wrong during transit; alone he could handle it, but with another he couldn't guarantee their safety.

But now, his comprehension and mastery of spatial power had already reached a considerable level — taking someone and instantly moving a thousand li away was no problem for him at all.

With such confidence, he naturally feared nothing.

The energy-film formation over the jade platform, under Yang Yan's efforts, still remained firm, but odd ripples passed across its surface; as the ripples flickered the film swelled and contracted, looking very strange.

Moreover, unlike previous formation-breaking attempts, Yang Yan's expression this time was especially grave; her cheeks flushed and she appeared to be straining.

As time passed, the film formation began to tremble and seemed on the verge of collapse; Yang Kai knew at once it was about to be broken.

At that moment Yang Yan suddenly warned, "Be careful."

No sooner had she spoken than the formation shattered, and at the same time a surge of pure fire Spiritual Qi burst forth from the strange ore, causing both Yang Kai and Yang Yan's faces to change dramatically.

In an instant the entire secret cave grew unbearably hot, and a fire-dragon-like attack raced toward them.

Yang Yan's face went deathly pale; although she had a premonition of danger, she didn't expect such a thing to occur upon breaking the formation—before the fire dragon reached her she already felt as if she were being melted away.

Several defensive Secret Treasures she wore immediately activated as she sensed the danger, layers of protection materializing before her.

Those Secret Treasures were all Origin-Grade Lower-Level, specially made for her; in terms of defense they were not inferior to ordinary Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures.

Yet even so, the fire dragon barreled in unstoppable; the concentrated fire Spiritual Qi met her protections and melted them all. With a series of cracking sounds Yang Yan's earrings shattered, a bracelet on her hand was smashed, and a piece of armor she wore instantly dulled.

The three layers of protection could not withstand the fire dragon at all; before it the protections were as flimsy as paper, and even the Secret Treasures themselves were destroyed.
