## Chapter 1494 — Great Sun Wish-Fulfillment Seal

A dozen-odd of them—what kind of notion was that? Although Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu had never cultivated the Demon Blood Threads, they still understood this secret art. They knew it took the power of one’s own Qi and blood as the foundation and was catalyzed by the essence of flesh and blood, a product that existed between a Secret Treasure and a secret technique. So even if people from the Demon Blood Sect were powerful, it was impossible to cultivate too many of them.

When the Sect Master of the Demon Blood Sect cultivated the Demon Blood Threads, she supplemented it with the vile art of harvesting yang to nourish yin, wantonly collecting robust men’s Essence-Blood to barely cultivate two threads. How much Qi and blood power did Yang Kai possess to produce a dozen-odd in one go? Moreover, judging by his expression, there were no signs of Qi and blood depletion at all. On the contrary, he brimmed with vitality, and his Qi and blood power was stronger than anyone’s.

This was somewhat inconceivable.

Could it be this was not the Demon Blood Threads secret art at all, and merely similar in shape?

The two were completely at a loss.

What they did not know was that a dozen-odd Golden Blood Threads were not Yang Kai’s limit. He now had as many as several dozen Golden Blood Threads within him, each one transformed from a drop of pure Golden Blood.

With something like Life Jade Nectar, Yang Kai no longer needed to worry about a shortage of Golden Blood, so he spared no effort condensing Golden Blood Threads.

After those dozen-odd Golden Blood Threads shot out, they did not immediately attack the Protective Mountain Array. Instead, they entwined and writhed among themselves as though endowed with sentience, gradually twisting into one, and with a slight tremor transformed into a golden spear about one zhang long.

Brilliant golden radiance dazzled as imposing might surged, and it abruptly lunged toward that Protective Mountain Array.

Boom…

A thunderous bang rang out as the spear tip struck the light curtain of the Protective Mountain Array. The curtain immediately sank in like an inflated leather ball, caving deeply and making Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, who were watching from the side, twitch their eyelids wildly in shock and wonder.

The two had been attacking this Protective Mountain Array here for half a month and were naturally familiar with its sturdiness. At this moment, upon seeing the spear’s might, they had already inferred how lethal it was.

It was a ferocious strike that made even them shudder in fear.

However, the Protective Mountain Array was indeed formidable. No matter how Yang Kai urged the golden spear, he still could not break it. After it sank to a certain degree, a rebound force suddenly emerged. Not only did the light curtain restore itself to its original state, even the spear formed by the dozen-odd Golden Blood Threads was bounced into midair.

Yang Kai’s expression was as calm as an ancient well. With his Divine Sense tethering the spear, a mere stirring of his mind caused it to disassemble once more, turning back into a dozen-odd Golden Blood Threads. Then those Golden Blood Threads entangled again, transforming into a battle axe. It fell from the heavens, carrying world‑annihilating momentum, and hacked viciously toward the light curtain.

This was the way of transformation of the Golden Blood Threads, and precisely the essence recorded in the latter half of the Demon Blood Threads secret art.

Yang Kai was excited, paying no mind to his surroundings. He devoted himself wholly to controlling the Golden Blood Threads, shaping them into all manner of forms and pressure‑testing the Protective Mountain Array again and again.

The transformations of the Golden Blood Threads could not be achieved with merely one or two threads. Only when their number reached a certain threshold could these wondrous changes appear.

No one knew what cultivation realm the seniors who created the Demon Blood Threads had reached. But ever since Dark Star became constrained by the laws of heaven and earth, no one in the Demon Blood Sect had been able to carry this way of transformation forward.

Even that bewitching Sect Master, after exhausting the efforts of her lifetime, could only barely cultivate two Demon Blood Threads—so what talk was there of transformation? She was not without gains, however. At the Ice Path, Yang Kai had once seen her two Demon Blood Threads turn into two blood serpents, like living things, inscrutable to the extreme.

That too was one manifestation of the way of transformation. Although Yang Kai knew how to cultivate it, at present he could not meet the requirements.

Because it required the Spirit Essence and Inner Core of powerful demonic beasts to cultivate.

What Yang Kai now displayed was another kind of transformation.

At first he was not very adept, but as time passed and he unleashed transformation after transformation, his command of the Golden Blood Threads grew increasingly skillful. The threads took shape as his heart willed, changing without end.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu clicked their tongues in wonder from the side and did not rashly disturb him, because from Yang Kai’s focused bearing they could see that he was immersed here in the practice and familiarization of a certain secret art.

That was a good thing; how could the two of them have any reason to interfere?

The Protective Mountain Array of the ancient Sect ruins within the Fallen Emperor Mountains had already been bombarded by several hundred Origin Returning Realm cultivators for half a month and was tottering. After Yang Kai joined for two days, they finally made breakthrough progress.

A faint cracking sound suddenly came from somewhere—soft though it was, it rang unmistakably clear in the ears of every cultivator present.

Looking toward the source of the sound, everyone saw that at a certain position on the light curtain of the Protective Mountain Array, a tiny fissure had actually appeared.

In an instant, the assembled heroes were roused, each rejoicing.

Although it was a crack so small as to be nearly negligible, it nonetheless showed that this section of the Protective Mountain Array had reached its limit. With just a bit more effort, perhaps in the very next moment it could be broken.

Without anyone giving orders, after a brief lull, everyone increased the force of their output.

Crack, crack…

Sounds continued to come from all directions. Like sparks igniting a prairie fire and with that earliest crack as the center, spider‑web‑dense rifts soon appeared crisscrossing the light curtain of the Protective Mountain Array, too many to count.

A violent spiritual pressure suddenly spread from somewhere. All the cultivators who sensed this fluctuation could not help showing alarm as they turned their heads to look that way.

There, a blue‑robed cultivator slowly rose into the sky like an ancient god descending, unmatched in might. His hands were raised high, and in his palms he supported a light sphere as dazzling as the sun. That startling power fluctuation was emanating from this light sphere.

For a time, that blue‑robed cultivator became the focus of ten thousand gazes.

“Qu Zheng’s Great Sun Wish-Fulfillment Seal truly lives up to its reputation,” Fei Zhi Tu muttered, sounding a little apprehensive, as he looked that way.

“That man is the Battle Sky Alliance’s Alliance Master, Qu Zheng?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Indeed.” Qian Tong nodded lightly at the side, a trace of wariness on his face. “He is also one of the foremost experts on Dark Star. Although this old man and he are both at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, if we truly crossed hands, my chance of victory would be less than twenty percent!”

Even when cultivation realms were the same, differences in strength would appear. Those differences stemmed from the arts and secret techniques one practiced and the might of the Secret Treasures one commanded.

So even though they were both at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, Qian Tong did not dare claim his strength was equal to Qu Zheng’s.

It was just like Yang Kai: although he was only at the First Stage, ordinary cultivators of the First Stage had virtually no power to resist before him—this was a common phenomenon.

As they spoke, Qu Zheng had already flown to several hundred zhang above, his expression incomparably solemn. He lightly tossed the light sphere in his hands down below.

As if without weight, the light sphere fell downward at an exceedingly slow speed.

So slow? Yang Kai frowned. If the so‑called Great Sun Wish-Fulfillment Seal was really only as it appeared to be, it would not amount to much. It was simply too slow—who would be foolish enough to stand still and not dodge?

But since both Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu dreaded it so, it absolutely could not be as he imagined.

With that thought, Yang Kai watched even more intently.

Just then, a sudden change occurred.

The Great Sun Wish-Fulfillment Seal, which had been falling slowly, suddenly disappeared from everyone’s sight. When it reappeared, it was already above the Protective Mountain Array.

It seemed to have crossed more than one hundred zhang in an instant.

Yang Kai’s face changed, and he cried out, “Spatial Force?”

But he quickly shook his head, denying his own judgment. If it truly were Spatial Force, he could not possibly fail to feel that peculiar fluctuation. After all, in terms of attainments in Spatial Force, he considered himself inferior to no one. Even the Battle Sky Alliance’s Great Elder, Mo Xiaosheng—who was proficient in the power of space—could not compare with him.

It was not Spatial Force; the Great Sun Wish-Fulfillment Seal was simply too fast. The earlier slowness had merely been an illusion.

With immense might and terrifying speed, this secret technique that Qu Zheng commanded was indeed extraordinary. If one were to take such a blow head‑on, even if one did not die, one would shed a layer of skin.

As various thoughts flashed through his mind, the Great Sun Wish-Fulfillment Seal had already touched the light curtain. Soundlessly, the visible energy sphere burst apart, turning into a blinding halo. In an instant, almost everyone could not open their eyes.

Though no sound could be heard, the burst of energy was utterly terrifying. A sudden gale, mixed with surging Spiritual Qi, erupted outward from the point of impact, spreading violently in all directions. Along its path, sand and stones were swept up, trees so thick that several men together could barely encircle them were uprooted, and even the onlookers miles away—those with weaker cultivation—staggered under the force, nearly blown off their feet.

Crack, crack…

Crackling like beans being fried rang incessantly in the ears, and soon everything returned to calm.

When the radiance faded and everyone opened their eyes again, they were shocked to find that the light curtain of the Protective Mountain Array had vanished. Amid the mountain forests, the ruins of the ancient Sect loomed in and out of view.

Qu Zheng stood proudly in midair, his face full of arrogance.

Although everyone present had rendered meritorious service in breaking the Protective Mountain Array, it was, after all, his final strike that settled the matter. He greatly enjoyed this worshipful feeling under ten thousand gazes.

From all directions came countless flattering voices, extolling Qu Zheng’s god‑like prowess as peerless under heaven.

“Enough, enough. Since the grand array has been broken, it is time to go in and see what lies within. Gentlemen, this old man will take the lead!” Qu Zheng cupped his fists slightly and immediately flew forward, and the many experts of the Battle Sky Alliance naturally followed close behind.

Next, a group from the Leitai Sect also rushed in.

After the experts of the two great powers departed, the many Origin Returning Realm cultivators present swarmed in, each seeking different positions as they penetrated the ruins of that ancient Sect in hopes of reaping some harvest.

They had, after all, exerted themselves for more than half a month. Now that it was time to collect the fruits, naturally no one wished to lag behind.

Yang Kai, together with Fei Zhi Tu and Qian Tong, also mixed into the crowd. With a sweep of his Divine Sense, Qian Tong pointed in a direction and said, “Over there!”
