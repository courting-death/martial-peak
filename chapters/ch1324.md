## Chapter 1324 — Third Stage of the Saint King Realm

The hundred zhang gap narrowed swiftly, and just as he was about to overtake Elder Wang, Yang Kai suddenly sensed an earth-shattering surge of energy from behind; in the blink of an eye a streak of light flashed past his side and struck Elder Wang squarely in the back.

A horrible scream echoed out as Elder Wang collapsed to the ground; after a few feeble struggles he lay still.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and looked back in surprise, seeing Yang Yan in a black robe on the other side holding a crossbow-like Secret Treasure, waving it at him.

Yang Kai recognized that Secret Treasure—it was one of the spoils he had taken in Flowing Flame Sandland.

He had obtained it from a cultivator of the Xie Family; that person had once used the treasure to ambush him, but failed and was ultimately cut down by Yang Kai. Although the treasure's power was considerable, using it exacted a heavy price: each activation required a Blood Sacrifice. It was an evil Secret Treasure, so after obtaining it Yang Kai had paid it little mind and tossed it into his Spatial Ring.

He had not expected Yang Yan, at some point, to have refined and improved it—now that she brought it to bear against an enemy it proved effective.

With Elder Wang already dead, one trouble was spared. Yang Kai walked to the corpse, silently activated the power of his World-Ending Demon Eye, and soon the old man's soul was drawn into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness to be purified. After taking the old man's Spatial Ring he immediately returned.

In the abandoned main hall, Qian Yue's beautiful eyes stared unblinking at Yang Kai, as if she hardly recognized him.

Yang Yan, after having used that powerful crossbow Secret Treasure, was also somewhat spent; her face was noticeably pale. It seemed that even after her refinements, firing the treasure still demanded a heavy toll.

"Rest a while, we'll set out again in a bit; there shouldn't be any more ambushes here," Yang Kai said, handing Yang Yan a Pill before walking over to the Space Array.

He intended to thoroughly destroy the Space Array; whether or not the enemy had left a contingency, he could not leave any clues for pursuers to follow.

While Yang Yan hurried to recover, Qian Yue set about gathering the spoils left behind by the other Saint King Realm cultivators.

After a short while, with Yang Yan still meditating, Yang Kai and Qian Yue were ready. Qian Yue handed over the Spatial Rings those men had left behind, her face still showing some shock—she still had trouble accepting what had just occurred.

Yang Kai glanced at her, naturally understanding what she was thinking, and waved his hand. “Keep it for yourself. There probably isn’t anything valuable in there anyway—but it suits your current needs. Don’t worry about it. Once we get to Dragon Lair Mountain, you’ll see how abundant things are there and how extravagant everyone is. After that, you won’t even look twice at such trinkets.”

Qian Yue paused for a moment, then accepted without further refusal, replying cheerfully, "I'm looking forward to it."

She couldn't help but look forward to Dragon Lair Mountain; ever since arriving in the Star Domain and ending up at Hehuan House she had met no acquaintances and had no place to rely on. She felt like a rootless tree, a water without source—every day was agony.

Now Yang Kai had appeared, and she found in him a center to cling to. Although he was a junior, his cultivation had already surpassed hers; leaning on him a little was not a problem.

While Yang Yan recovered, Yang Kai sat to one side, contemplating the gains and losses from the fight.

This was not his first time confronting an expert of the Origin Returning Realm, but it was his first time killing a cultivator of that rank. Had it not been for the interference of the Soul-Devouring insects and the strangeness of the space power, he certainly would not have been a match.

Yet this battle also revealed an unexpected boon: his Golden Blood Threads could dispel the opponent's envelopment of Shi. When Deng Ning of the Demon Blood Sect taught him the Demon Blood Threads technique he had never mentioned this.

Facing an elder of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, he had to exhaust himself. What if it had been a Second or Third Stage?

Yang Kai suddenly realized his cultivation was still a bit lacking. After returning he needed to advance another stage; only when his cultivation could also reach the Origin Returning Realm would he be able to fear no one on Dark Star.

Half a day later, with Yang Yan largely recovered, Yang Kai summoned his Star Shuttle and the three of them left the ruined city.

Two days into their journey they passed a small city. Yang Kai went down to scout and learned that Tianyun City was only about half a month's journey from there. He could not help but feel elated.

He had feared the ruined city might be even farther from Tianyun City than Black Crow City, so it seemed his luck had held—Wang Yuhan had not chosen to ambush them on the side opposite Tianyun City.

Moreover, this area was under the jurisdiction of Yingyue Hall. Given his relationships with Qian Tong, Wei Guchang, and Dong Xuan'er, they were essentially safe here.

Along the way Yang Kai remained silent, planning his future moves, while Yang Yan and Qian Yue chatted occasionally. Half a month passed in a flash, and when the three returned to Dragon Lair Mountain, Qian Yue fell in love with the place at first sight.

Dragon Lair Mountain was not as grand or imposing as the foundations of the great Sects, but it had its own style—clear streams, beautiful scenery, and talented people; it was like a paradise removed from the world.

After entrusting Qian Yue to Yang Yan's care, Yang Kai went to see the Divine Tree and learned it had fared well. The transplanted Golden Sun Fruit tree, nourished by it, had become vigorous and no longer faced the risk of withering.

After letting the Divine Tree consume a drop of Golden Blood, Yang Kai immediately announced he would enter seclusion.

Inside his stone abode Yang Kai toyed with a translucent, icy-cold bead in his hand, his eyes full of tenderness.

That bead was Su Yan's Ice Soul Pearl—while the pearl remained intact so did the person; if the pearl shattered, the person would perish. Though he still did not know Su Yan's whereabouts, the pearl's survival meant she was safe.

There was a trace of Su Yan's aura on the pearl, which made Yang Kai yearn for her all the more.

After gazing for a long while, Yang Kai finally grinned, closed his fingers around the Ice Soul Pearl, shut his eyes, and began circulating his profound cultivation technique, striking against the bottleneck within himself.

In Hehuan House his Third Stage of the Saint King Realm bottleneck had already been touched, but at that time he had forcibly suppressed it to hasten the search for Su Yan's whereabouts. Now back at Dragon Lair Mountain, his first priority was to break through the current realm.

The Ten-Thousand-Year Incense burned on, its scent curling through the air and calming the mind. Yang Kai chose to meditate beneath the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, an excellent place to comprehend the Martial and Heavenly Dao. This breakthrough posed no real obstacle.

In a mere ten days, without using any Pills or Saint Crystals for aid, Yang Kai successfully broke through to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

The commotion of the breakthrough leaked not a whit; it was fully contained by the stone abode's restraining formations, and the people of Dragon Lair Mountain remained unaware of his advancement.

After spending more than a month consolidating his cultivation, Yang Kai began to take stock of what he had gained on the trip.

With a thought he took out another bead and toyed with it in his palm. Unlike Su Yan's Ice Soul Pearl, this one was gray and unremarkable—the Glazed Pearl that Daiyuan had given him.

It was the essence condensed in Daiyuan's body after practicing the Thousand Illusions Glaze—a crystallized refinement equivalent to a Demonic Beast's Inner Core and extremely precious.

Daiyuan had said that if he could refine this Glazed Pearl he might comprehend the mysteries of the Glazed Light.

The Glazed Light possessed the ability to bind the body and restrain the soul—mysterious and powerful. Yang Kai had suffered a small loss to it before and knew its danger. If he could indeed achieve what Daiyuan suggested, his methods against foes would be increased.

Moreover, Glazed Light and his World-Ending Demon Eye shared some similarities; the World-Ending Demon Eye also had functions that intimidated the soul. If the two could be combined, who could say what transformations might occur.

After musing a while, Yang Kai placed the Glazed Pearl aside and took out the Void King-Grade refining furnace.

When he had extracted the Sun's True Essence from the Corpse Den, the Artifact Spirit had been injured. Later Yang Kai discovered this was a blessing in disguise—the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird had absorbed a sliver of the Sun's True Fire while hiding within the refining furnace and was assimilating it.

More than a month had passed and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird had not yet awakened; it was still refining and assimilating that remnant of Sun's True Fire, but Yang Kai found that the Sun's True Fire seemed much reduced while the Fire Bird's aura had grown considerably stronger.

He immediately understood the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird had truly gained a great boon.

Leaving it be, Yang Kai put away the refining furnace.

Next he inspected the Stone Puppet. Like the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, the Stone Puppet had been injured, but after the Stone Puppet disgorged the Sun's True Essence Yang Kai had it absorb various mineral essences to repair itself. Now that he looked, he was greatly surprised.

The Stone Puppet's wounds had indeed healed. After being released it rolled its eyes about, its intelligence seeming to have increased noticeably.

What concerned Yang Kai more, however, was that the Stone Puppet's body seemed to contain an overwhelmingly domineering fire attribute energy; even Yang Kai's Divine Sense could not penetrate it. The moment his Divine Sense touched it, it was burned to cinders.

Sun's True Fire!

He had not expected the Stone Puppet to have absorbed the Sun's True Fire as well—and to have transformed it even earlier than the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird. Yang Kai was overjoyed; with such innate talent, even an Artifact Spirit born of fire could not compare.

The Stone Puppet was born with the power to purify minerals. Now that it possessed Sun's True Fire, its purifying ability would be far more thorough and perfect.

Unfortunately he still had not found another Blood Essence Stone; after all, in his Black Book Space there was another Stone Puppet, and without a Blood Essence Stone that Stone Puppet could not truly be born.

Having confirmed the Stone Puppet was not only unharmed but had benefited, Yang Kai shifted his Divine Sense and issued it a command.

The Stone Puppet opened its mouth and spat out countless refined mineral pieces, which quickly piled into a small mountain before Yang Kai.
