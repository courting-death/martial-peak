## Chapter 2520 — Dragonbone Wasteland

Jia Si observed Yang Kai’s expression, vaguely sensing something, and swallowed hard. “Young Master, there is something I am not sure if I should say!”

“If it’s nonsense, then don’t bother!” Yang Kai looked at him coldly.

Jia Si said, “A month and a half ago, Elder Ju Tianqing came to see the City Lord. The next day, the City Lord left Kunyuan City.”

“Ju Tianqing?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows. “Who is that?”

Jia Si replied, “He is one of the ten Emperor Realm Elders of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land and has always been close friends with the City Lord.”

“From Brahma Heaven Sacred Land?” Yang Kai was a little surprised.

Of course, Yang Kai knew of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land—it was one of the top Sects in the Eastern Territory, holding a status comparable to that of Qingyang Shrine in the Southern Territory.

The two Holy Sons, Chang Xian and Chang Hao, whom he met in the Shattered Star Sea, were also from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. Their cultivation and talent were indeed outstanding. If not for their bad luck in running into him, they might very well have advanced to the Emperor Realm in this trip to the Shattered Star Sea.

And that Ju Tianqing was just one of the ten Emperor Realm Elders of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. It seemed that Brahma Heaven Sacred Land truly lived up to its reputation as a top Sect, with overall strength even above Qingyang Shrine.

“What is Ju Tianqing’s exact cultivation?” Yang Kai had a faint feeling that Ju Tianqing was greatly involved in the matter with Gao Xueting.

“Also First Stage of the Emperor Realm.” Jia Si had already said this much and naturally would not hide anything else. He answered everything truthfully, just wanting to leave as soon as possible. Judging by Yang Kai’s earlier display of crushing a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level shield Secret Treasure with a single hand, he could kill him with just a flick of his finger.

Jia Si did not think his own body was sturdier than that shield.

Yang Kai nodded, raised a finger, and said, “One last question. Do you know where Ju Tianqing or Zu Hong are now?”

Jia Si wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and replied uneasily, “I really don’t know!”

The cold light in Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly became dangerous.

Jia Si was terrified, his face falling. “The City Lord didn’t tell me anything before leaving. I truly don’t know!” He paused, then said in panic, “But if Young Master insists on knowing, I could help you investigate…”

“Investigate?” Yang Kai snorted heavily. “Didn’t you just say Zu Hong didn’t tell you anything before leaving? How will you investigate?”

Jia Si stammered, “I could try to sound out the Young City Lord or the City Lord’s wife. Maybe they know something. If that doesn’t work, I could ask a few of Elder Ju’s disciples. To be honest, I have a good relationship with them. Maybe they know where Elder Ju is now.”

“How long?” Yang Kai asked coldly.

“Two hours… no, one hour is enough.”

Yang Kai’s face immediately brightened with a smile. “Then I’ll trouble Lord Jia. Go quickly and come back soon. I’ll wait for you here.”

Jia Si sprang up and rushed out as if something was chasing him.

But just as he moved, Yang Kai casually placed a mark on him.

Jia Si’s face changed dramatically. He stared at Yang Kai in horror, feeling as if the spot where he was struck was burning, the pain unbearable.

“Don’t be nervous. This is just a little secret technique of mine, called the Bone-Splitting and Tendon-Severing Seal. It won’t affect you in the short term…” Yang Kai smiled harmlessly.

“What about in the long term…” Jia Si asked, trembling.

“If it’s not released by my unique method within twelve hours, your bones will separate, your meridians will be severed, and you’ll wish you were dead!” Yang Kai’s voice turned icy at the end, like a cold wind blowing from the Purgatory, making one’s hair stand on end.

Jia Si’s face turned ashen, but with Yang Kai’s strength, he dared not resist. After a moment of panic, he stomped his foot and sped away like the wind.

Yang Kai called over the teahouse’s waiter, ordered another pot of tea, and leisurely enjoyed it.

It didn’t even take an hour—just the time of one incense stick burning—before Jia Si suddenly returned.

“So fast?” Yang Kai looked at him in surprise and praised, “Lord Jia, you are truly capable. Your intelligence work is outstanding. You must be the City Lord’s right-hand man.”

Jia Si gave a fawning smile. “It was just luck. The City Lord happened to mention something to his wife before leaving, so it was easy to find out.”

Yang Kai gave him a strange look and teased, “You even managed to get information from the City Lord’s wife? Tsk tsk, are you sure your City Lord isn’t being kept in the dark about something?”

Jia Si’s face changed. “Young Master, please don’t joke. I heard it from the City Lord’s wife’s maid, not what you’re thinking.”

“Alright.” Yang Kai replied lazily, then his expression turned serious. “Tell me what I want to know.”

Jia Si said, “The City Lord said he was going to the Dragonbone Wasteland. I don’t know the exact location.”

“Dragonbone Wasteland!” A cold light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes.

Jia Si said, “That’s all I could find out. Any more information is impossible. Young Master, what do you think…?”

Yang Kai nodded, stood up, and patted his shoulder. “Understood. Let’s part ways here.”

As he finished speaking, his figure blurred and then disappeared.

Jia Si’s face changed drastically. He shouted, “What about the Bone-Splitting and Tendon-Severing Seal…?”

But there was no sign of Yang Kai. Anxious, he cursed Yang Kai for being untrustworthy and shameless.

Soon, he realized something was wrong, because the burning pain quickly disappeared. Probing with his Divine Sense, he found nothing unusual.

Only then did he understand that when Yang Kai patted his shoulder, he must have lifted the mark.

Overjoyed, he shivered again, then quietly made his way toward the city gate, preparing to leave Kunyuan City immediately.

He had revealed so much information to Yang Kai today. No matter what happened, he could no longer stay in Kunyuan City. If the City Lord returned safely, he would surely investigate, and the crime of leaking secrets was not something he could bear.

Even if the City Lord didn’t return, who knew if Yang Kai would come looking for trouble again? The only thing to do now was to get as far away as possible, preferably escape the Eastern Territory and hide in another.

…

Outside the city, Yang Kai easily found Zhang Ruoxi and Lu Wen. After calling them onto his wooden boat, he asked Lu Wen, “Where is the Dragonbone Wasteland?”

Lu Wen pointed in a direction. “That way, about two days’ journey.” She paused, then exclaimed, “Elder Gao is at the Dragonbone Wasteland?”

“It’s very likely,” Yang Kai replied in a deep voice. “But I don’t know exactly where. Is that place big?”

“Big, very big!” Lu Wen nodded. “It’s said to be an ancient battlefield where many people died, filled with extremely dense Baleful Yin Qi. Many cultivators like to train and explore there. Sometimes, lucky people can find ancient treasures and make a fortune. Especially in the center, the Baleful Yin Qi is so thick that even Emperor Realm cultivators dare not approach lightly. It’s said there are dragon bones there, so everyone calls it the Dragonbone Wasteland.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and grinned. “Then let’s check out the center first.”

The wooden boat was extremely fast. It was a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level flying Secret Treasure, and with Yang Kai’s space abilities, it was like leaping through space—covering dozens or even hundreds of li in the blink of an eye.

At first, Lu Wen didn’t notice anything unusual, but after calming down, she realized the speed was off. Her heart trembled, and she felt even more confident in Yang Kai.

In less than half a day, Yang Kai arrived at the Dragonbone Wasteland. Below was a desolate, lifeless expanse stretching for who knew how many li. Strange yin energy swirled like whirlwinds, and when they sensed living beings approaching, they gathered with a rush.

This was only the outskirts of the Dragonbone Wasteland, so the Baleful Yin Qi was very weak. It couldn’t get close to Yang Kai and the others, being flung far away instead.

Yang Kai had no intention of tangling with the yin energy. As he delved deeper, his Divine Sense spread out like a sea, probing every corner he could reach.

He didn’t know if Gao Xueting was in the Dragonbone Wasteland, but this was his only clue, so he had to follow it to the end.

Half a day later, Yang Kai had reached the heart of the Dragonbone Wasteland.

Along the way, Yang Kai found that this was indeed a good place for cultivators to train. If he were still in the Dao Origin Realm, it would be a great place to temper himself. But now that he had advanced to the Emperor Realm, there was no point in cultivating here.

Suddenly, Yang Kai seemed to notice something and stared in a certain direction.

He saw several powerful cultivators standing there, guarding the area and warning off strangers. Moreover, something seemed off about the space in that direction.

This made Yang Kai suspicious, so he steered the wooden boat straight toward them.

“Who goes there!” Before Yang Kai could get close, a shout rang out from that side.

“Stop right there! Come any closer and don’t blame us for being rude!” Another voice threatened.

Yang Kai didn’t care at all. The wooden boat charged forward, stopping not far from those people.

“Insolence!”

“Courting death!”

Several angry shouts rang out, and then beams of secret techniques burst forth. Waves of fierce power crashed down on the wooden boat.

Lu Wen was so frightened her face turned pale, almost unable to stand.

But Zhang Ruoxi stood behind Yang Kai, completely unfazed, ignoring the attacks.

Boom boom boom…

Several explosions sounded, but the expected impact never came. Instead, the attackers on the other side cried out in alarm, as if they had been ambushed. Groans followed, and some even collapsed to the ground.

Lu Wen’s eyes widened, but no matter how she tried, she couldn’t see what Yang Kai had done.
