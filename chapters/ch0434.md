## Chapter 434 — Fame Spreads in Zhongdu

The two Huo Family Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage experts looked awkward, wanting to explain to the Young Master that it wasn’t their fault for failing to conceal him properly, but no words would come out. They still didn’t understand how they had been exposed; this matter was steeped in mystery.

“This time, the Young Master is truly finished; there will be no burial place for him—utterly powerless to reverse his fate,” sighed Huo Xingchen, shaking his head repeatedly.

“What happened?” The two experts were deeply alarmed. They had followed Huo Xingchen for many years, yet had never heard him speak so gravely. Hearing this, they naturally assumed something was seriously wrong with him and grew concerned.

“I, the Young Master, have to run naked through War City ten times. Do you think I’m doomed?” Huo Xingchen asked, looking sullen.

The two experts immediately exchanged bizarre looks, inwardly musing that although their Young Master was skilled in indulgence and debauchery, he had never developed such a disgraceful habit.

Exchanging a glance, they pictured Huo Xingchen sprinting bare-assed through War City, causing the women there to scream. Somehow, they almost burst out laughing.

They hurriedly restrained their expressions, and one asked, “Young Master, what exactly happened? Why do you have to do... cough... that? Were you forced?”

“No one forced me. I just lost my head this afternoon and made a bet with that bastard Yang Kai!” Recalling the scene of the wager, Huo Xingchen’s teeth itched with resentment.

That bastard Yang Kai clearly had a plan; the foolishness was on Huo Xingchen’s part for thinking the man would not resist tonight. He had been distracted by a Golden Feather Eagle and rashly accepted the challenge.

At the time, he thought the fool was overreaching, but now it seemed the fool was not Yang Kai, but himself.

After briefly explaining the bet, the two Huo Family experts fell silent.

They all knew the Young Master’s character. Huo Xingchen had quite a bad reputation—wanton and unrestrained, a libertine through and through—but such a man never reneged on what he said.

In other words, his sense of honor in betting was remarkable. Though a rogue and a scoundrel, once he placed a bet, he never backed out.

This could be seen from how, when he lacked silver at the start, he outright mortgaged the Xuan Guang Association to Yang Kai. This showed he was arrogant and disliked owing debts, including bets and favors.

Since the bet was made and lost, he truly must run naked through War City ten times.

The two experts from the Huo Family almost foresaw how, when this matter reached the Huo Family, the old master Huo Zheng would be so furious he’d bleed from all his orifices and die.

“Is there any clever plan to help the Young Master evade this calamity? Pray, tell,” Huo Xingchen said as he walked aside and, without a shred of dignity, sat sloppily on a large rock, glancing sideways at the two.

The two exchanged a glance and one cleared his throat, saying, “Young Master, I think Yang Kai does not truly wish for you to run naked through War City ten times. After all, you are his ally. He would want to save you some face. Perhaps you should speak with him directly. He might grant you a favor and reduce the matter.”

“Nonsense!” Huo Xingchen bellowed. “Though I don’t see much of him, I know his temperament well. That bastard is ruthless, cold-hearted, and more difficult to deal with than me. If I don’t show some concession, he absolutely will insist I run ten naked laps. Maybe he’s already looking for me!”

Gritting his teeth, he cursed, “Damn it, that bastard is no ordinary power—otherwise I would just beat him up to vent!”

Thinking of that night’s battle and how Yang Kai defeated Xiang Tianxiao with a single move, Huo Xingchen could not help but feel resentful.

All these sons of the Eight Great Families, yet he was just that formidable?

“What kind of expression does the Young Master want to make?” one asked, sensing the unspoken meaning behind Huo Xingchen’s words.

“I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking you,” Huo Xingchen said with a carefree shrug.

The man pondered, then slowly said, “How about this? Since Young Master has already declared himself an ally of Yang Kai, although the old master opposes it, there is nothing he can do. Moreover, it seems Yang Kai’s manor currently lacks manpower and resources. Our Huo Family is wealthy with abundant talent. We could ask the old master for some people and supplies to send to him. This way, Yang Kai is unlikely to insist on the bet.”

Huo Xingchen chuckled, pointing at the expert. “You said that, not me. When I go home, if my father asks, you tell him the truth.”

The expert was startled, then smiled bitterly, realizing Huo Xingchen had planned this all along, merely coaxing him to say it out loud.

This gave Huo Zheng a reasonable excuse when inquiring about the matter.

Though angry at his son’s recklessness and unwilling to give him any resources, with the two experts acting as persuaders, perhaps manpower and materials could be mobilized from the Huo Family.

“Enough. Let’s go home. We must settle this before sunrise, lest that bastard accuse the Young Master of reneging and being untrustworthy,” Huo Xingchen said, hands behind his back as he swaggered toward Zhongdu, followed closely by the two Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage experts.

From an unnoticed angle, Huo Xingchen’s expression turned grave and solemn, bereft of his usual hubris and unbridled nature.

Tonight’s battle had everyone astounded by the two Blood Servants’ formidable protective abilities, and his own rogue behavior attracted attention as well. No one had the time to consider how those two Blood Servants had recovered from severe wounds in one day to their peak.

Huo Xingchen admitted he had underestimated Yang Kai. Before nightfall, he thought Yang Kai was surely doomed tonight. Even guessing that he had a secret weapon, there seemed no way to reverse the situation.

Yet he never imagined Yang Kai could easily defend his manor and even take a leisurely stroll outside.

This Yang Family young master was indeed intriguing.

Not only him, but the Yang Family’s other young members were no pushovers.

Originally, Huo Xingchen had intended only to casually play in this succession war, to pass the time, but now, he vaguely looked forward to seeing how it would end—to see if Yang Kai would fall or rise.

Deep in thought, Huo Xingchen pondered much on his way home.

Two battles transpired on the first night of the succession war: one at Third Brother Yang Tie’s manor, and the other at Ninth Brother Yang Kai’s manor.

The outcomes of both battles shocked onlookers.

Notably, Yang Kai’s figure was entwined in both conflicts.

During the fight at Yang Tie’s manor, Yang Kai seized the command flag and key personnel amidst chaos, while his own manor, left undefended, miraculously held strong.

This was simply unbelievable.

Few believed these news, but after much inquiry, they confirmed their truth.

Meanwhile, another bombshell emerged: Yang Kai not only had Huo Xingchen as an ally but also gained the temporary support of Qiu Yimeng from the Qiu Family, who had temporarily separated from her clan to aid him.

Huo Xingchen’s allegiance was understandable—a trifling playboy picking favorites—but why did Qiu Yimeng, well-known for her sharp judgment, willingly and temporarily leave her family to help him?

Once forgotten, the young man of the Yang Family now had the backing of two scions from the Eight Great Families, causing shock throughout War City and Zhongdu alike, as Yang Kai’s fame spread far and wide.

Yang Kai’s momentum was unmatched for now.

As the moon hid and the sun rose, dawn came.

In the courtyard, Yang Kai was performing the Indomitable Golden Body technique, while Qiu Yimeng, visibly exhausted, approached.

She had barely slept all night, tending to the aftermath of yesterday’s battle.

Stopping a few paces away, suspicion shone in her beautiful eyes.

She had seen this martial art before and was not unfamiliar with it, but seeing it now, she couldn’t perceive any particular brilliance; it appeared she could easily perform it herself.

She didn’t understand why Yang Kai was so fond of this seemingly mundane fighting style, always practicing it at sunrise.

“Is there something?” Yang Kai asked softly.

“Your cousin has arrived,” Qiu Yimeng rubbed her forehead and answered.

“That fat one?”

“Yes, that fat one.”

“Let him find a place to stay himself. I’ll go see him later.”

“Oh,” Qiu Yimeng nodded and walked off a few steps but turned back, saying, “I forgot to tell you, you’d better set aside a whole day.”

“For what?”

“Someone might come to pledge allegiance to you.”

“No strangers,” Yang Kai frowned but kept pacing through his moves calmly.

The potential arrival was surely due to news of last night spreading. While many forces had already chosen allies at Zhongdu’s South Gate during the day, others were watching silently, waiting to see how the young masters performed before deciding.

Yang Kai’s flashy showing last night made new allegiances unsurprising.

Qiu Yimeng surprisingly did not argue but nodded softly. “Quite right. If someone unknown comes, it’s probably for profit.”

She had thoroughly seen through Yang Kai’s nature now: vindictive and only yielding to force, not softness. Now that their relations were somewhat cordial, she had no desire to oppose him and incur his enmity.

Acknowledging this, she returned to her tasks.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai concluded his practice. His bones crackled with delight. The Indomitable Golden Body technique still eluded full mastery; this seemingly ordinary martial art held some profound truth hidden deep within. The further he pushed, the greater the pressure he felt. With his current cultivation, he could only execute half the moves.

He estimated that reaching beyond the Divine Roaming Realm would be necessary to fully manifest the Indomitable Golden Body technique.
