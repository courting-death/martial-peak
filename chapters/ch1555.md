## Chapter 1555 — I'm Back

That mass of gray qi felt extremely unsettling, like an old man approaching his last days, in the twilight of life with little time left.

Xia Ningshang had formed a kind of symbiotic relationship with it; how could her fate possibly end well in the future?

Yang Kai's expression was as calm and dark as still water.

Although he very much wanted to relieve Little Senior Sister of this present trouble, until he understood the true nature of the gray qi, Yang Kai had no place to start.

Moreover, he vaguely sensed from the gray qi a strange quality he could not fathom; when Yang Kai probed, a sudden clarity arose in his mind.

But when he examined more closely, he found nothing at all.

It seemed to strongly repel Yang Kai's Divine Sense.

Xia Ningshang's ability to breakthrough to the Saint King Realm in a place like the Tongxuan Continent must be inseparable from this bizarre gray qi.

This thing had given her the opportunity to perceive deeper layers of the Martial Dao and supplied the abundant Spiritual Qi needed for her advancement, yet it remained closely bound to her.

Whether it was a blessing or a curse, no one could say for sure.

Just as Yang Kai was at a loss, the gray qi bound by the golden net suddenly surged wildly again; this time it did not waste effort like before, but directly burst apart, fragmenting into finer threads of gray qi that slipped through the net's seams.

Yang Kai had no time to stop it; the gray qi escaped.

In the next instant, it shot downward at astonishing speed, and the moment it touched the ground, it slipped out of Yang Kai’s sight.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense followed close behind, yet still could not detect its presence.

And so it simply vanished.

Standing where he was, Yang Kai's face grew heavy. He furrowed his brows.

It seemed he would have to wait until Little Senior Sister woke up to get answers from her.

He had some guesses in his heart, but dared not be certain.

Looking at the sleeping Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai lifted her in his arms, laid her on the bed, bent over to kiss her forehead, and gently smoothed the hair at her brow before leaving the chamber.

A few breaths later, a thousand li away: the War Soul Hall ruins.

Yang Kai stood in the void, overlooking below, his Divine Sense spreading like the tide.

Familiar traces of life were laid bare under his probing, each one like a leaping musical note, engraved into his Sea of Consciousness and composing a stirring melody.

He grinned, feeling a warmth he had not known for decades; with Divine Sense he sent word to all his friends and family — he... was back!

It was just like in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land before.

The War Soul Hall ruins immediately erupted in commotion, beams of light rising from each person's meditation place as they hurried toward where Yang Kai stood.

Everyone was beyond excited; meeting on the way, they probed one another for confirmation, making sure that Yang Kai had truly returned.

Only after arriving and seeing Yang Kai standing there did they dare confirm the truth of the news.

Tu Feng, Tang Yuxian, Qu Gaoyi, Ying Jiu… those Blood Servants who once fought side by side with Yang Kai during the Succession War were the first to arrive. Each of them trembled with excitement, loudly calling out the Young Master’s name and bowing in deep salute.

Yang Family's First Brother Yang Wei, Second Brother Yang Zhao, Third Brother Yang Tie, Fourth Brother Yang Kang... all the brothers gathered, clamoring as they surged forward to embrace Yang Kai fiercely, pouring out decades of brotherly longing.

"Haha, you bastard — you left for so many years, I've missed you to death," Huo Xingchen, the current head of the Huo Family, laughed boisterously as he appeared at Yang Kai's side.

Decades had passed; this once dashing Zhongdu wolf had entered middle age, yet time had not made him look old — instead it had given him a weathered maturity that, combined with his rakish charm, made him more attractive.

Beside Huo Xingchen stood Qiu Yimeng; tears brimmed in her beautiful eyes, she gently bit her lip and stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, too afraid to speak for fear of shattering the dream.

"Brother Huo, Miss Qiu!" Yang Kai nodded lightly to the two, his expression calm.

Huo Xingchen chuckled and cast a glance at Qiu Yimeng, sighing inwardly.

From the way Yang Kai addressed Qiu Yimeng, he caught on to something.

Dong Qinghan and Dong Qingyan had come as well, calling out “Cousin! Cousin!” one after another, making the atmosphere all the more lively.

Yang Kai's gaze suddenly turned to three streaks of light rapidly approaching not far off; he hurried over to greet them.

The lights descended, revealing three figures.

The foremost bore an immortal bearing, robes flowing in the wind; behind him followed a man and a woman — the man imposing, the woman delicate and exquisite.

Yang Kai stood before them, bowed, and softly said, "Grandmaster!"

Ling Taixu nodded repeatedly, laughing with delight, "Good, good, finally you're back."

"Father, Mother!" Yang Kai then looked to the two standing behind Ling Taixu.

Fourth Master Yang, a man of iron, opened his mouth but found himself at a loss for words. He only wiped the corner of his eye quietly and nodded, saying, “Your mother… missed you very much.”

On hearing that, Dong Suzhu suddenly burst into tears like a wronged child, rushing forward to hold Yang Kai tightly, patting his back with jade-like hands, sobbing and unable to form words.

Seeing her like that, Yang Kai smiled.

Decades had passed, yet his mother still kept that childlike heart — unchanged — which put him at ease.

"What the hell are you at now? Why can't I sense you at all?" Huo Xingchen blurted as he strode up, circling Yang Kai and clicking his tongue in amazement.

Everyone was momentarily stunned, then released Divine Sense to sweep over Yang Kai.

But to no avail — everyone's Divine Sense sank like a stone into the sea, not creating the slightest ripple.

This discovery left them shocked; instinctively they felt Yang Kai's cultivation might now exceed the standard of the Tongxuan Continent, and all showed expressions of awe.

"Origin Returning Realm." Yang Kai released Dong Suzhu, patted her shoulder in consolation, and, unsure how to explain what the Origin Returning Realm entailed, paused before saying, "Yes — it's two Realms beyond the Saint Realm."

A round of sharp intakes of breath sounded.

The Saint Realm was already the pinnacle of the Tongxuan Continent; above entering the Saint was the Saint King Realm, and throughout history only the Great Demon God had ever reached that level.

Yet now Yang Kai had already surpassed that legendary Realm and arrived at the next tier.

Qiu Yimeng's bright eyes suddenly dimmed; her heart tasted bitter.

She felt as if a thousand mountains and rivers lay between her and Yang Kai — he stood high on the clouds while she remained on the ground, looking up with no way to reach him.

Huo Xingchen pursed his dry lips, forced a laugh and glanced at Qiu Yimeng, not knowing how to comfort her.

Miss Qiu, though not lacking in talent and having abundant cultivation resources upon arriving at the Tongxuan Continent, had only reached the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm and had not yet refined True Yuan into a Saint.

The gap was far too great...

"There are many marvelous things in the outside world — I'll tell you another day. For now, let's go back," Yang Kai said with a chuckle.

"Go back, go back!" Fourth Master Yang reacted and began to call out.

A throng gathered, pressing forward as they departed for the War Soul Hall ruins.

Inside the great hall, everyone sat as one, their eyes fixed on Yang Kai while he recounted the bizarre and wonderful scenes he had witnessed in the Star Domain.

"Kid, you say that in the vast Star Domain there are countless cultivation stars?" Ling Taixu asked in disbelief.

"Indeed — just I alone have traversed six or seven cultivation stars; beyond that there are mining stars and Medicine Stars suitable for extracting ore and cultivating herbs," Yang Kai nodded.

"This is incredible." Huo Xingchen's mouth hung wide enough to fit a fist.

"In the Star Domain, is the Saint Realm considered weak?" Dong Qinghan timidly asked; decades had passed but he was just as portly as ever, perhaps even a little fatter.

"Very weak." Yang Kai nodded gravely. "In the Star Domain, most martial artists can cultivate to the Saint Realm; those with good aptitude can reach it around their twenties or thirties."

The gathered faces looked at one another, full of shame.

Among those present, only one had reached the Saint Realm — Ling Taixu, Master of Lingxiao Pavilion; others, even the most gifted like Qiu Yimeng, were only at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, and as for Dong Fatty and Huo Xingchen, they had only just broken into the Transcendent Realm.

They were nearly fifty; once proud of their accomplishments, they now felt mortified hearing Yang Kai speak of the Star Domain and wished they could crawl into a hole.

“A frog at the bottom of a well, thinking the sky no bigger than its mouth…” Ling Taixu let out a deep sigh.

"Grandmaster needn't belittle himself — the achievements in the Star Domain stem from its exceedingly rich Spiritual Qi. The Tongxuan Continent is simply ill-suited for martial cultivation; given the same conditions I believe everyone here could break into the Saint Realm without difficulty," Yang Kai said earnestly.

"That may be true, but how difficult it is to enter the Star Domain." Ling Taixu slowly shook his head and smiled wryly. "I won't hide it from you — ten years ago I and Meng Wuya once broke into the Star Domain, but we had not even traveled one hundred thousand li before being forced to retreat. The Star Domain seems to exert a strange compressing force from all sides; if one's physical body cannot meet the requirement, one simply cannot traverse it."

"The power of the Starry Sky." Yang Kai nodded lightly, then grinned: "But Grandmaster needn't worry — I'm back this time to take you all to the Star Domain, to those better cultivation stars."

The expressions inside the hall brightened; everyone looked at Yang Kai in astonishment.

"Truly?"

"How will you take us?"

"There are so many of us — can you take us all?"

Voices chattered eagerly, each question tumbling out; they all longed to abandon this backward continent for places where Spiritual Qi was denser, to see a broader world and the dazzling wonders Yang Kai had described.
