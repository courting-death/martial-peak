## Chapter 1953 — Ice Flower and Strange Fruits

With a month and a half of confinement still ahead of him, Yang Kai had no urgent matters to attend to, so his mind grew restless.

Arriving at the cave entrance and looking down, the scene before his eyes remained an impenetrable blackness.

A month and a half earlier, he could only descend to a position less than five hundred zhang below this Ice Cliff before being forced to return, which showed how hostile this place was.

Now that his strength had increased considerably, he was keen to test where his limit truly lay.

Besides, if he could remain for a long time under the cover of Imperial Might and that ice-cold profound intent, it would be of tremendous benefit to his will and state of mind; not to mention that when facing a Dao Origin Realm expert in the future, he would not be so easily suppressed by their pressure.

If he could withstand the force of Imperial Might, how could he fear the oppressive presence of a Dao Origin Realm?

Thinking this, Yang Kai no longer hesitated and leapt, plunging downward.

As before, the deeper he went the denser the Imperial Might became, and the more cruel the surrounding ice-cold profound intent; the omnipresent cold seeped into Yang Kai’s flesh and Sea of Consciousness, becoming the greatest resistance to his descent.

Yang Kai’s speed was not great; he probed his limits bit by bit.

Three hundred zhang — he remained unscathed; five hundred zhang — he could still endure; eight hundred zhang — it became somewhat strenuous...

By the time he reached roughly one thousand zhang down, Yang Kai found it difficult to continue.

He had advanced a Stage, his Origin Qi had transformed considerably, and he had even refined his Void Mind Crystal, yet he could only dive five hundred zhang deeper than before? Yang Kai shook his head and felt increasingly able to appreciate the terror of the Emperor Realm.

At his current level, one thousand zhang was essentially the limit.

Just as he considered stopping at that position and even planning to carve out a new cave nearby to temper himself, a flash of insight sprang to mind that excited him.

"I wonder if Nothingness can resist the ice-cold profound intent!"

Without hesitation, Yang Kai moved his will and immediately employed the new secret technique he had just comprehended.

In an instant he vanished from sight, leaving only a transparent, nearly imperceptible phantom behind, rippling like water.

Upon deploying the Nothingness technique, Yang Kai instantly felt the terrifying Imperial Might and the ravaging ice-cold profound intent that had wrapped him vanish in that moment.

The place where he stood no longer bore any pressure.

It truly worked!

But before Yang Kai could savor his surprise, he discovered a new problem.

For the brief moments after using Nothingness he could indeed ignore the Imperial Might and the ice-cold profound intent, but it only lasted for two breaths. The omnipresent Imperial Might and the ice-cold law then shattered his secret art, forcing his form to reappear.

A tide of pressure, vast as the sea, surged in exactly on cue.

Standing there, Yang Kai frowned and contemplated the cause.

Soon he gained insight.

His technique relied on spatial power, fusing his body with the void to create a blind spot for visual and Divine Sense detection.

Because his body merged with the void, he deceived the surrounding Imperial Might and ice-cold law and could thus ignore their suppression.

But Nothingness was not omnipotent; after all, his Realm was too low to control Imperial Might and the ice-cold profound intent, so he was influenced by them. When the two forces collided, his command of spatial power naturally could not match the Imperial Might and the ice-cold profound intent, and thus his trace showed again.

In other words, any force exceeding his could break his Nothingness technique.

Yang Kai had a realization.

This was unavoidable; he felt no discouragement, but rather that such a flaw was reasonable to exist.

There were no truly unbreakable moves or secret arts in the world; ultimately it all came down to one’s own strength.

But if that was the case...

Yang Kai grinned, cast Nothingness again, flickered, and simultaneously used his teleportation.

The next moment he had plunged another fifty zhang down, and quickly the surrounding Imperial Might and ice-cold law shattered his Nothingness.

But as his figure reappeared, before the terrifying forces could press down on him, he again activated Nothingness, merging into the void and evading the murderous intent.

Repeating this, Yang Kai sped downward at great pace, utterly forgetting the danger of his surroundings.

He had originally only intended to test Nothingness, but caught up in the impulse he descended ever deeper; by the time he came to his senses he did not know how many zhang he had gone down.

Coming to his senses, Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat and looked up, seeing only a sliver of light like the sky.

He dared not linger; instinctively he wanted to leave this accursed place at once to avoid a misstep that would bury him here and make him a laughingstock.

Just as he prepared to leave, something flickered in his peripheral vision somewhere below — a faint gleam.

"What is that?" Yang Kai cast Nothingness repeatedly while turning his head downward.

A moment later another flicker of light blinked at that spot.

Yang Kai confirmed it was not an illusion; something really existed there. After a brief thought he used teleportation again and dove downward.

To his surprise this time, he found himself unknowingly at the very bottom of the Ice Cliff!

At this deepest point, the Imperial Might and ice-cold profound intent would instantly kill an ordinary Dao Origin Realm expert; even a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert could not penetrate to the bottom here.

Earlier Kou Wu had said that within the Biyu Sect the Sect Master and the four great Protectors had come to investigate the Ice Cliff, but none had managed to reach the bottom.

Yet Yang Kai’s Nothingness technique had given him temporary protection, allowing him to reach a place untouched for ten thousand years.

The glow wasn't far off. Yang Kai crept forward cautiously, edging closer while keeping a wary eye on his surroundings, afraid that some sudden killing intent might descend at any moment.

Before long he arrived at the source of the light.

The light at the cliff base was dim, but Yang Kai was no ordinary man, and his sight was not hindered; looking ahead his eyes brightened.

Not far before him, a strange growth in the shape of an ice flower stood out; it looked as if it had been chiseled from solid ice, every facet crystalline and flawless, without the slightest impurity.

At the top of this growth, three small fruits had formed.

The fruits were small, each the size of a pigeon’s egg, and likewise crystalline; a faint light emanated from their surfaces, making them appear unreal.

At first glance Yang Kai instinctively thought they were not spirit flowers or spirit fruits but actually carved ice.

But soon he realized he was mistaken, for a faint fragrance hovered in the air — the aroma unique to spirit fruits, cool and refreshing to the mind.

This was unmistakably a true wonder — a rare flower and spirit fruit!

In this terrifying cliff-bottom environment Yang Kai dared not send out Divine Sense, yet he could still tell that both the ice flower and the three ice fruits contained extremely powerful energy; for a cultivator who trained in ice techniques these would be peerless treasures!

They had likely been born because of the Imperial Might and ice-cold profound intent here.

Yang Kai quickly formed a conjecture: such wondrous flora born in this place would be unimaginably valuable, for having long bathed in this special environment, both flower and fruit must contain Imperial Might and ice-cold profound intent; whether used in pill refinement or ingested, they would very likely allow a cultivator to comprehend the divine arts of that Emperor expert.

Priceless treasures!

Yang Kai’s breath quickened and he almost failed to trigger Nothingness in time, which made him break out in a cold sweat.

Steadying himself, Yang Kai crouched, focused his will, and activated the Undying Five Elements Sword’s sword intent.

In an instant a crimson flame enveloped his right hand.

That was the power of the fire sword intent!

To harvest such a treasure it was impossible not to take precautions; the only idea he could think of was to use the fire sword intent to counter the ice-cold profound intent within the wondrous flower and fruit.

Yet he still underestimated its terror: when his hand touched the stem of the ice flower, the crimson flame trembled and nearly died, and at the same time an indescribable cold ran up his finger and spread along his arm.

With the naked eye one could see frost spreading over Yang Kai’s arm.

Alarmed, without thinking he shouted, "Dragon Transformation!"

Along with a high dragon roar, a golden dragon’s shadow suddenly appeared behind Yang Kai and flashed away; simultaneously his right arm transformed into a dragon’s claw, covered in scales and fearsome.

He clenched the ice flower and pulled it up with force, not daring to linger, and promptly hurled it into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

The next instant, he gathered his will and probed the interior of the Xuan Realm Pearl with his Divine Sense.

Inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, the towering Incarnation that had been meditating slowly opened its eyes; a fragment of Yang Kai’s Soul Incarnation remained within that Incarnation, so it could act freely.

The mountain-like body rose, swayed slightly, and vanished from its seclusion; when it reappeared it had already arrived somewhere else.

That place was exactly where Yang Kai had thrown the ice flower.

Crackling sounds rang out continuously.

Within the Xuan Realm Pearl the place where the ice flower lay was rapidly turning into frozen ground and spreading outward at astonishing speed; the profound intent within the ice flower even affected the Pearl’s internal space, lowering its temperature.

Soon an ice layer covered a radius of ten li, and only then did the anomaly from the ice flower gradually subside.

The Incarnation inside the Xuan Realm Pearl and Yang Kai at the cliff-bottom both breathed a light sigh of relief, finally putting their minds at ease.
