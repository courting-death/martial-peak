## Chapter 973 — Self-Destructed?

Ever since he obtained the Star Shuttle, Yang Kai would always use that astonishingly fast Secret Treasure whenever he was hurrying along.

He had set aside the Wind-and-Thunder Wings.

Yet those wings, which had nearly become a part of his body, still served an irreplaceable purpose.

With wind rising and thunder surging, Yang Kai transformed into a streak of light and shot away.

He knew full well the gap in power between himself and Ke Luo, so he would never recklessly try to fight him head-on; he only needed to delay long enough for Meng Wuya, Chu Lingxiao, Changyuan, Lei Long and the others to disengage and come help, and then the situation could be settled.

He was also certain that Ke Luo would not let him escape, because Yang Kai had a Blood Essence Stone — a vast concentration of blood qi that Ke Luo needed to ascend to the Saint King Realm.

If Ke Luo still had his wits about him, he would never let him go.

Yang Kai saw straight through Ke Luo's heart.

Sure enough, once Yang Kai sped away, Ke Luo's eyelids tightened and his expression turned feral; his green eyes fixed on Yang Kai's departing back, radiating murderous intent and rage.

His figure flickered as he shot after Yang Kai.

His speed was terrifyingly fast, rivaling — and even surpassing — Yang Kai with the Wind-and-Thunder Wings deployed.

Spatial constraints meant nothing to him; with a single step he would appear hundreds of zhang away, another step and he was elsewhere again, rapidly closing the distance between them.

The chilling killing intent at his back left Yang Kai’s whole body cold. While fleeing, he tried to tear open space, only to be shocked to find it had become impossibly thick and viscous. Some strange power, hidden within the void, sealed off the area around him, making it utterly impossible for him to tear a rift in space.  

This Ke Luo must have done considerable study of spatial laws; otherwise, even with his higher realm he could not have accomplished this. Yang Kai's mind flashed cold and he became ever more alert.

One pursuing, one fleeing — it seemed endless.

Yang Kai deliberately began to circle instead of dashing flat-out in one direction; he still needed to wait for reinforcements. If he ran too far, those others might not catch up.

The presence of death pressed on his heart at all times, weighing on him like a mountain.

He had never faced such a grueling, helpless battle. Ke Luo's strength exceeded that of Changyuan, Meng Wuya and the others — he was truly the continent's number one.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

A ripping sound came from behind; before the attack even arrived, Yang Kai felt as if his body were being sliced open — a soul-shuddering illusion.

Startled, he deployed the Silver Leaf Secret Treasure, which transformed into rippling waves around him. He shifted direction like a serpent, moving nimbly through the air.

Boom, boom, boom...

The strikes still landed with deadly precision on his back; excruciating pain followed, and Yang Kai felt his back go numb and warm blood seeping out.

Even that Saint-Grade Upper-Level Silver Leaf Secret Treasure was shattered in an instant.

“You won't get away. Surrender and I'll grant you a merciful death!” Ke Luo's voice sounded by his ear; he seemed certain of victory.

In the next moment Ke Luo appeared at Yang Kai's side, running shoulder to shoulder with him and casting a mocking glance. He extended a finger toward Yang Kai; energy surged at the fingertip with terrifying force.

Before that attack could land, Yang Kai pressed his palms together and unleashed the Beast Soul Seal; the White Tiger Divine Ox roared and lunged to tear at Ke Luo. At the same time Yang Kai pivoted cleverly and bolted in another direction.

That momentary respite allowed Yang Kai to once again widen the gap between himself and Ke Luo.

Anxiety flooded his heart. He kept praying that Meng Wuya and the others would finish quickly.

“I'll make sure you die without a grave!”

Ke Luo howled, his features contorted with ferocity.

Chasing him so long without succeeding had plainly driven him into a blind rage.

An overwhelming murderous aura swept the heavens and earth; Ke Luo poured out every ounce of effort, no longer interested in playing cat-and-mouse.

The sky suddenly dimmed. Rivulets of crimson light streaked the horizon like coagulated blood; like lightning, like a long rainbow, they shot toward Yang Kai with blinding speed.

Alarm bells rang in Yang Kai's mind. He once more deployed the Silver Leaf and gathered several Vast Heaven Shields behind him to defend.

Yet an immense sense of crisis remained, as if even these precautions would be of little use.

“Ice Seal!” a woman's sharp command rang out, and Yang Kai saw a graceful figure rapidly approaching — Han Fei.

Han Fei's expression was icy, like an ancient unmelting glacier; wild Demon Marks crawled across her fair face, making her look even more ruthless than usual.

In her hand she wielded an ice crystal longsword, and as she swung it a stream of cold exhaled; the power of the Ice Seals the Heavens and Earth technique erupted behind Yang Kai.

Crack, crack...

The ground turned to frozen earth, and the pursuing blood qi seemed to freeze in an instant.

Han Fei passed Yang Kai as if to intercept Ke Luo for a moment.

Yang Kai, however, swept her into his arms and spun away like a whirlwind, shouting, “You can't stand up to him!”

Han Fei could never match him; the best outcome if she stayed would be grievous injury, quite possibly death.

The cracking sounds continued to spread. The extreme chill had indeed stalled Ke Luo for an instant, making his steps slightly sluggish and coating him with a thin layer of frost — but only for a fleeting moment, and then the frost melted away.

Ke Luo resumed his pursuit with even greater fury.

“My lord!” Han Fei stared back in alarm, whispering, “Who is this man? How could he be so formidable?”

“The Bone Race leader!” Yang Kai released her and hurriedly asked, “How are things on your side?”

“The fleeing Bone Race forces have been almost wiped out; those who chased after them will be back soon!” Han Fei replied quickly.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened and he couldn't help but grin.

At that moment, four figures came racing in from the flank. From a distance they saw Yang Kai fleeing with Han Fei and Ke Luo hot on their heels, and all froze for a beat.

They were the Four Great Demon Generals!

Two more figures followed and stood beside the four generals.

They were two other Great Lords of the yao.

The six had finished chasing down the fleeing Bone Race creatures and thought the battle was over; on their return they discovered this scene.

The six stood shoulder to shoulder, gazes hostile as they fixed on Ke Luo. A pressure like the rupture of heaven and earth converged and crashed toward him.

Ke Luo finally realized the danger. His pursuit of Yang Kai halted abruptly; he turned and coldly sized up the six.

A snort escaped him. He closed his eyes and remained motionless, exuding an extremely perilous aura as if invoking something.

Moments later, six or seven skulls the size of houses streaked across the distant sky.

These were the skulls that had previously harassed Changyuan and Meng Wuya — there had been over ten before, but now only about half remained.

The snake-like Secret Treasure also flew back and poured into Ke Luo, magnifying his violent, cruel aura.

“Ke Luo, you're finished!” Yang Kai stopped fleeing and stood with Han Fei, staring coldly at him.

No sooner had he spoken than figures appeared beside him — Meng Wuya and the others who had chased those skulls and the snake-like Secret Treasure.

Eleven at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm and one at the Second Stage; counting Yang Kai, thirteen in all — an unprecedented, terrifying lineup.

The thirteen formed an iron bucket formation and encircled Ke Luo, their combined momentum pressing toward him to prevent his escape.

“Finished?” Ke Luo looked composed and let out a chuckle. “Not necessarily.”

Glancing at Yang Kai, he said, “You think I don't know your scheme? Waiting for them to arrive so you can overwhelm me with numbers.”

Yang Kai frowned, unease rising faintly in his chest.

Ke Luo's calm unnerved Yang Kai — the composure made it unclear whose ploy had succeeded.

“I told you, even short of the Saint King Realm there's no one in this world who can match me. No matter how many of you come, it won't change anything!” Ke Luo roared.

“Cease your arrogance—before this Lord, it is not your turn to be so wanton!” Changyuan’s expression darkened, his mood utterly foul.

“If you have some heaven-piercing trick, show it then,” Meng Wuya said coolly. Though his words sounded casual, Saint Yuan surged and he was on high alert.

“As you wish!” Ke Luo laughed, suddenly sitting cross-legged. His green eyes trembled wildly and seven-colored radiance burst forth from them.

His hands kept forming unknown spirit formulas while his lips chanted incessantly.

A tide of qi and blood surged within him, climbing like a flood; his skin glowed crimson, as if at any moment it might drip blood.

Tiny, crisp cracks sounded across his body; it seemed his bones were fracturing and his skin split into innumerable small wounds.

Dark red blood flowed from those wounds, turning him in an instant into a terrifying Blood Man.

“Careful!” Chu Lingxiao shouted.

This was certainly Ke Luo's last resort. From his confident tone and expression, the technique must be devastating; none would dare charge in without knowing its depth.

Everyone's faces grew grave, each more tense than the last.

Ke Luo's blood gushed from him ceaselessly, as if it would never end, dyeing the ground red.

A stench of blood spread into the air.

Suddenly Ke Luo threw back his head and laughed, rising to his feet as he shouted, “Let me show you my Bone Race's forbidden art — Blood Pool Flesh Forest! You will die without regrets!”

With his roar, his flesh abruptly exploded outward; chunks of flesh flew in all directions, and his bony form shattered as bone fragments were hurled about.

“He self-destructed?” everyone gaped in disbelief.

No one had expected Ke Luo's tremendous momentum to end with his body tearing itself apart.

“No, fall back!” Yang Kai cried out sharply, sensing the onset of danger and retreating at once.

“Too late!” Ke Luo cackled; his laughter filled the air. The shattered flesh and scattered bones suddenly seemed to come alive, converging into a surging sea of blood that swallowed the world and engulfed the thirteen.
