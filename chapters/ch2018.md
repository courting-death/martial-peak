## Chapter 2018 — Zhang Family

Gongsun Mu had been a figure of great standing in his day, so even the servant at his side had not been weak; after being driven away by Gongsun Mu the servant retired to the Southern Territory, married, bore children, and founded a family of his own.

But as generations passed, the family's descendants varied in aptitude and the clan gradually declined into obscurity.

Until a little over a hundred years ago the family was reduced to a single heir, who, when hunted down by enemies, was rescued by Kang Siran—though his wounds were too severe for Kang Siran to save him.

Before dying, that final descendant gratefully revealed the family secret that had been passed down by word of mouth through the generations.

That was how Kang Siran came into possession of information about Gongsun Mu's cave dwelling—by a strangely convoluted path.

Yang Kai had no particular doubts upon hearing this.

For one, he had dealt with Kang Siran for some days and found him a decent man, not someone likely to deceive him. For another, the world was full of coincidences; he himself had experienced many.

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai said, "If that place truly is Gongsun Mu's cave dwelling, it is worth investigating. But… Shopkeeper Kang, why come to me? Your Commerce Guild has many talents; surely there are people far stronger than I. Wouldn't sending them increase the chance of success?"

Kang Siran chuckled, "Alchemist Yang worries too much. Our guild headquarters truly has many experts, numerous Dao Origin Realm practitioners; if they all went, both the success rate and safety would indeed rise. But if that were the case… how much would I personally gain? You must understand this is a private matter of mine, not a guild affair. If the experts at headquarters were to catch wind of it, this old one wouldn’t even get to sip the leftover broth. My plan is to find someone of similar strength to accompany me — I hope Alchemist Yang can understand."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and said, "I understand Shopkeeper Kang's concerns."

"It is fortunate you can empathize," Kang Siran said, his tone softening. "And what would Alchemist Yang's opinion be…?"

Yang Kai smiled, "Since it involves Gongsun Mu, that alchemical master, I am naturally interested."

Kang Siran rejoiced and said, "Very well. Then it is settled. However, I have one more favor to ask."

"Speak, Shopkeeper Kang!"

Kang Siran's expression turned solemn as he said, "If there still remain Dao Origin Pills inside that cave, I must take one first."

"That is no problem," Yang Kai answered without hesitation.

Kang Siran was taken aback, apparently not expecting such a quick agreement. A look of gratitude showed on his face as he said, "Thank you, Alchemist Yang. I know my own aptitude is poor; without a Dao Origin Pill aiding me, I will never ascend to the Dao Origin Realm in this lifetime. Dao Origin Pills are extraordinarily rare. When the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda opened this time I failed to obtain any of the three Dao Origin Fruits; otherwise I would not be in such a hurry to explore that cave. But rest assured, anything related to alchemy inside will belong to Alchemist Yang; as for other items, we shall discuss their distribution later."

"Very well." Yang Kai nodded. "When do we depart?"

“Let us set it for one month from now. A month hence, this old one will await Alchemist Yang’s esteemed arrival at the Pill Shop. I must also make some preparations during this time. Moreover, the city is planning to host an auction, and this old one intends to join the excitement to see whether anything worthwhile can be obtained. I wonder if Alchemist Yang has any interest in accompanying me?” Kang Siran asked.

"The city is holding an auction?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Yes," Kang Siran chuckled. "Many warriors in Fenglin City obtained fine items from the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda this time, so the city lord plans to host an auction to circulate goods. Perhaps a Dao Origin Fruit will appear there. You are now at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; it may be time to prepare for Dao Origin Pill in advance."

"Indeed I should. When and where will the auction be held?" Yang Kai asked.

……

Half an hour later Yang Kai stepped out of the Pill Shop.

He did not commit to attending the auction; he merely told Kang Siran that if he were free he might drop by, which Kang Siran had no objection to.

Upon leaving the shop, Yang Kai did not return to his cave but headed out of the city.

Soon after leaving Fenglin City, he flew northward.

About thirty li from Fenglin City stood a manor-like estate. Residences clustered within the grounds, bridges and streams meandered, and the environment was serene and elegant.

Yang Kai alighted alone and swept his Divine Sense over part of the estate, murmuring, "This should be the place."

He had come to fulfill the agreement he had made in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda with a man named Zhang Gaoxuan. The Zhang Family was somewhat known in Fenglin City, so after a little inquiry he had located their estate.

The Zhang Family's main dwelling was not inside Fenglin City but outside, for land inside the city was precious; to house a whole clan there would be costly, whereas building an estate outside was different. Although the Spiritual Qi there was not thick, it was sufficient for a small family's use.

From a glance, Yang Kai saw that the Zhangs had at least some understanding of formations and had set up a few rudimentary arrays within the estate to draw in Spiritual Qi.

Having received a Dao Origin Fruit from the Zhang Family’s head, Zhang Gaoxuan, Yang Kai was obliged in both sentiment and reason to come here for a visit, bringing along Zhang Gaoxuan’s remaining belongings and final instructions.

He had delayed until now simply because he had been busy.

At the main gate he was about to call out when, unexpectedly, two streaks of light shot from within and aimed straight for his face.

Behind those two streaks, two figures sprang forth, each forming hand seals, eyes bloodshot as if harboring mortal hatred toward Yang Kai and ready to kill.

Yang Kai was taken aback.

He did not take their attack seriously — their cultivation was simply too low: one at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and the other at the First Stage; even an all-out strike from them could not inflict great harm.

So he stood his ground and flicked a finger.

Two crisp snaps rang out as the beams were shattered.

The two who had launched the attack paused in shock, then quickly scowled and charged with murderous resolve. No one knew what secret art they used; each spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood as their auras surged.

Yang Kai's brow tightened; before they could unleash any secret treasures he extended his Domain Field.

In an instant the two men were pinned as if beneath a mountain, their bodies stiff and unable to move, though their faces were filled with rage, their gazes burning with fury.

"Is this the Zhang Family?" Yang Kai asked calmly, maintaining the pressure of his Domain Field to suppress them.

The two were men of around thirty, one fat and one thin. The plumper man snorted, "Why ask? If you're going to kill, then kill; spare the words!"

The thinner man did not speak, but his eyes were cold and conveyed the same intent.

"What has happened to the Zhang Family?" Yang Kai was no fool; seeing this situation he could make some guesses and frowned.

"You're persistent. Since you came to do the Lu Family's business, why pretend otherwise?" the fat warrior sneered with contempt.

The thin man sneered in turn, "That old hypocrite Lu Baichuan puts on a virtuous face; of course the people he brings are of the same kind. Third Brother, why be surprised?"

The fat warrior guffawed, "Indeed — it's Third Brother who is lacking in wit."

With that he spat contemptuously at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sighed, "You must be mistaken. I do not know Lu Baichuan nor the Lu family; I only struck back because you ambushed me."

"If you do not know Lu Baichuan, why have you come to my Zhang Family?"

At that moment a strong, resonant voice came from within the estate. An elderly matron with silver-white hair, leaning on a staff as tall as herself and aided by a young maiden, stepped out.

A number of others followed behind her.

The matron was advanced in years, her face lined with wrinkles and speckled with brown age spots. Her gaze was like thunder, fixing Yang Kai.

Yang Kai swept her with his Divine Sense and immediately understood she cultivated at the First Stage of the Void King Realm and had recently been in a fight that damaged her root, leaving her Saint Yuan somewhat disordered.

Yet what puzzled him more was that those who followed the matron were entirely women — middle-aged wives, young mothers, maidens, and even several ungrown children.

The only men present were the two who had attacked him.

It seemed as if, apart from those two, all the men of the family had been killed.

Yang Kai waved his hand and withdrew his Domain Field, releasing the two men.

The two were sensible enough; perhaps realizing the gulf between their strength and Yang Kai's, they ceased hostilities and moved to the matron's side in a protective stance, watching him warily.

"I am Yang Kai. Greetings, Madam. May I ask if this is the Zhang Family?" Yang Kai cupped his fist and saluted.

"Yes, this is the Zhang Family," the matron said, striking her staff to the ground as she spoke.

"Good, then it is indeed the Zhang Family," Yang Kai smiled faintly and then asked with some hesitation, "Madam, do you perhaps have some misunderstanding with me? Why was I attacked as soon as I arrived?"

"A misunderstanding?" the matron scoffed. "Whether it is a misunderstanding depends on who you have come here to act for. You said you did not know that old thief Lu Baichuan?"

Yang Kai shook his head, "I have never heard the name."
