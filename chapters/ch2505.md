## Chapter 2505 — You Shouldn’t Have Saved Me

Regaining his composure, Yang Kai steadied his emotions and once again focused his attention on Duan Hongchen.

Duan Hongchen’s condition was dire. Even after consuming so many Spiritual Pills, it still wasn’t enough to stop his aura and vitality from fading away.

Yang Kai understood that it wasn’t that the Spiritual Pills he refined were ineffective, but rather that Duan Hongchen’s injuries were simply too severe. Not to mention the wounds caused by his own Heaven-shattering secret technique, Duan Hongchen had also suffered greatly in his earlier battle with Wu Kuang.

There was no way the Spiritual Pills alone could restore him.

This was bad! Yang Kai’s heart grew heavy.

Watching as the Mortal Great Emperor’s aura grew weaker and weaker, the very light of life about to be extinguished, Yang Kai could no longer hesitate. He reached out and grabbed at the void, and when he opened his palm, a green leaf had appeared there.

The veins of this green leaf were distinct, its color lush and vibrant, like a piece of the finest jade. It radiated an unimaginable surge of vitality. Holding it, Yang Kai felt as if he were grasping a living, breathing creature—the life force was so strong it was shocking.

A leaf from the Everlasting Tree!

Yang Kai had been forced into a corner and had no choice but to take a leaf from the Everlasting Tree, treating a dead horse as if it were still alive.

The Everlasting Tree, like the Warm Spirit Lotus, was a supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth, existing since the world’s creation. There was only one in all existence—never a second.

Immortal Source Liquid was born from the Everlasting Tree, known as one of the Three Divine Waters, with miraculous effects that could regrow flesh and revive the dead. It was the ultimate healing treasure under Heaven, unmatched by any Spiritual Pill.

Unfortunately, though Yang Kai possessed the Everlasting Tree, he no longer had any Immortal Source Liquid. The liquid he collected when he first obtained the tree had long since been used up.

If Immortal Source Liquid could work such miracles, could the leaves of the Everlasting Tree be any less wondrous?

Yang Kai didn’t know if this leaf could save Duan Hongchen’s life, but watching the Mortal Great Emperor on the verge of death, he had no choice but to try.

He picked the green leaf and immediately tossed it into Duan Hongchen’s mouth, then channeled his Emperor Yuan to help him refine it.

Suddenly, a streak of green light burst from Duan Hongchen’s Dantian, and in the next instant, the green glow expanded, enveloping his entire body.

Yang Kai was stunned, but he could clearly sense the astonishing vitality within the green light. Under its radiance, all of Duan Hongchen’s wounds began to heal at an incredible rate, and his nearly extinguished aura slowly started to recover.

This discovery eased Yang Kai’s heart—he knew he’d made the right choice.

The leaves of the Everlasting Tree truly did have the power to bring the dead back to life, and this effect seemed even stronger than that of the Immortal Source Liquid.

There was nothing more Yang Kai needed to do for Duan Hongchen now, except stand guard for him.

The green light shone with a unique brilliance in the dim Void Passage. Duan Hongchen’s aura gradually stabilized, blood began to flow through his body, and the sound of his heartbeat grew clear and strong in his chest.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the green light finally faded, and Duan Hongchen was no longer in any real danger—though for some reason, he still hadn’t awakened.

Yang Kai let out a long breath. Only now did he feel a wave of exhaustion welling up from deep within.

From the moment he started to break through to the Emperor Realm until now, he had barely had a moment’s rest. The Baptism of Heaven and Earth during his breakthrough, the bombardment of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, the sudden eruption of energy that formed a black hole and swallowed him, Wu Kuang’s attempt to seize his Sea of Consciousness, and then Duan Hongchen’s arrival and their ensuing battle.

Through all of this, Yang Kai’s nerves had been stretched to the limit. Now that everything had finally settled, he could truly relax.

Staring blankly at Duan Hongchen before him, Yang Kai suddenly felt as if everything was unreal.

The title of a Great Emperor—renowned throughout the Star Realm—had always belonged to legendary figures, as elusive as dragons, rarely seen by ordinary people in a lifetime.

Ever since Yang Kai arrived in the Star Realm, he’d constantly heard people mention the ten Great Emperors. Every time, those who spoke of them wore expressions of deep reverence, as if the Great Emperors were the very heavens and earth themselves…

Yang Kai never imagined that he would encounter a Great Emperor in the Shattered Star Sea—and not just one, but two at once!

Stranger still, both of these Great Emperors were ancient beings, locked in a life-and-death struggle before his eyes, and one of them was even hailed as the most ruthless figure in the Star Realm’s history.

He really didn’t know whether this was his fortune or his misfortune…

Suddenly, Duan Hongchen, who sat cross-legged before him, twitched his eyelids and slowly opened his eyes.

Yang Kai was overjoyed and called out softly, “Senior Duan!”

Duan Hongchen looked at him with a complicated gaze and asked gravely, “What did you make this old man take that could drag me back from the gates of death?”

Yang Kai grinned and casually made something up: “It’s nothing much, just a Spiritual Pill I got during my early years of training. I’m not even sure what kind it is, but it seemed decent, so I gave it to you, Senior.”

It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Duan Hongchen, but the Everlasting Tree was simply too shocking a treasure. It was best not to reveal it if possible. Besides, given Duan Hongchen’s earlier state, he probably couldn’t tell what he’d been given anyway.

“You foolish brat!” Duan Hongchen suddenly reached out and gave Yang Kai a hard slap.

Yang Kai didn’t dare dodge and took the hit squarely, grimacing in pain and protesting, “Senior, why did you hit me?!”

If it weren’t for the fact that this was the Mortal Great Emperor, and that he’d risked his life to drag Wu Kuang down with him, Yang Kai would have fought back long ago. But to be struck for no reason, he couldn’t help but feel aggrieved.

To save Duan Hongchen, he’d even plucked a leaf from the Everlasting Tree. There weren’t many of those leaves to begin with, and he didn’t know if the tree would suffer any harm from losing one.

If the Everlasting Tree suffered any harm because he’d plucked a leaf, Yang Kai would be at a complete loss.

“I, I…” Duan Hongchen looked utterly distressed, raising his hand as if to strike again, but in the end, he slapped himself and let out a heavy sigh.

Yang Kai stared at him in shock, a sudden sense of unease welling up from deep within. He hesitantly asked, “Senior, is there something wrong with your…?”

As he spoke, he pointed to his own head.

“If you want to say this old man is crazy, just say it. I won’t hit you!” Duan Hongchen snorted coldly.

Who was it that slapped him right after waking? Of course, he only dared think it—he wouldn’t say it out loud.

“You shouldn’t have saved me. You made a mistake!” Duan Hongchen sighed deeply, looking as if he’d lost everything in life.

Yang Kai replied in a low voice, “Senior, I can’t accept those words. You were willing to risk your life for all living beings—saving you is the least I could do. Compared to your sacrifice, what I did is nothing.”

Duan Hongchen grew furious and was about to retort when suddenly his face twisted in pain, his features contorting hideously.

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically and he cried out, “Senior, what’s wrong?!”

Duan Hongchen didn’t answer. His whole body trembled, cold sweat pouring from his forehead. Only after a long while did he finally calm down.

Yang Kai quietly sent out his Divine Sense to investigate, finding nothing seriously wrong, which left him puzzled. He had no idea what was happening to the Mortal Great Emperor.

“Hahahaha!” Suddenly, Duan Hongchen burst into loud laughter, his voice brimming with a pride completely at odds with before. His eyes shone as he looked at Yang Kai and praised, “Not bad, not bad! You did well, boy. This Lord must thank you. I nearly vanished into nothingness, but Heaven truly hasn’t abandoned me!”

At those words, Yang Kai leapt back, putting distance between himself and Duan Hongchen. He stared at him intently, a chilling thought rising in his heart as he gritted his teeth and growled, “Wu Kuang!”

“Oh?” Duan Hongchen looked at Yang Kai with a sly smile, a cold smirk on his lips. “Just from one sentence, you saw through my identity? Not bad, boy.”

“It’s really you?” Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat, staring in disbelief. His voice trembled, “You actually seized Senior Duan’s body?!”

“Not exactly,” Wu Kuang shook his head.

“Then what’s going on right now?” Yang Kai demanded, his voice fierce. He was certain the one speaking to him was none other than the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, but he was using Duan Hongchen’s body. If this wasn’t possession, what was? What shocked Yang Kai most was that he’d actually succeeded.

How could he have succeeded? Duan Hongchen was a Great Emperor, and his strength was in no way inferior. By rights, Wu Kuang shouldn’t have been able to possess him.

Before Wu Kuang could answer, Duan Hongchen’s face twisted hideously again, his body trembling violently. After a long while, he calmed down once more.

The previous aggressive look vanished, replaced by serenity.

Yang Kai’s mind was a mess, but he still tentatively asked, “Senior Duan?”

Duan Hongchen, panting, nodded gently. “It’s me.”

“What… what exactly is going on?” Yang Kai asked, his mouth agape in confusion.

Duan Hongchen sighed, “After that old thing escaped from your Sea of Consciousness, he slipped into my body, trying to possess me. Of course I wouldn’t let him, so we fought. But both of us were exhausted and wounded, neither able to overcome the other. If things had continued like that, I could have perished with him, but…”

“But what?”

Duan Hongchen shot him a glare and said, “I don’t even know what you made this old man take—but whatever it was, it restored both of our strength. What’s more, that old fiend Wu Kuang used a secret technique to force our Divine Souls to coexist, seizing control of half my body.”

“Th-this…” Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and swallowed hard. “Is something like that even possible?”
