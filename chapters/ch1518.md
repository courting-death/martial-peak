## Chapter 1518 — Lei Feng Canyon

Since the founding of Leitai Sect, this Lei Feng Canyon has always been its territory.

Back when Leitai Sect's name did not yet resound, many sects coveted this treasure ground and attempted to seize it, but none succeeded; every failed attempt simply became a stepping stone for Leitai Sect's rise.

In the process, Leitai Sect expanded like a rolling snowball and ultimately leapt to become one of the two great powers of Dark Star.

The outskirts of Lei Feng Canyon are shrouded year-round by poisonous miasma, making it nearly impossible for outsiders to approach — a natural defense for Leitai Sect. Disciples entering or leaving must take special antidote pills in advance or directly employ space arrays.

Otherwise, even those at the Saint King Realm cannot withstand the miasma's power: at best their limbs grow weak and their Saint Yuan fails to circulate, at worst they are poisoned and fall dead in an instant.

This is the main reason Leitai Sect has been able to hold this place.

Beyond this natural barrier, it is rumored that countless restrictive formations and arrays are scattered throughout Lei Feng Canyon; any who dare trespass would be torn to pieces.

Yang Kai had the warship to rely on, but he still did not dare be careless — Lei Feng Canyon was not like Battle Sky City; once you went in, getting out would likely be difficult.

So after the warship passed through the poisonous veil, Yang Kai ordered a significant slowdown, probing the surroundings while advancing cautiously.

What surprised him was that along the way they did not trigger a single formation, and they did not even see a single living person.

Under his Divine Sense, nothing within a radius of a hundred li could hide!

The vast Leitai Sect was empty; it seemed everyone had already withdrawn in advance.

Yang Kai's brows knitted tightly.

Ye Xijun also looked baffled. A few days earlier they had swept through like a thunderbolt, taking Battle Sky City and destroying Battle Sky Alliance, flaunting Lingxiao Sect's formidable might. But Leitai Sect had been famous for a long time; there was no reason for them to retreat without fighting.

To abandon an ancestral legacy that had persisted for tens of thousands of years — what sort of resolve would that take? What sort of prestige could command every disciple of a sect to follow such an order?

Fang Peng seemed a bit tougher to deal with than Qu Zheng, Yang Kai reflected.

"Yang Kai, Leitai Sect actually withdrew in advance — what shall we do?" Qian Tong looked speechless; he had expected a fierce battle like last time, not this outcome.

"Interesting!" Yang Kai snorted coldly.

A sect's foundation rests on its people, not merely its holdings. As long as its disciples live, there will always be a chance to rise again — Fang Peng clearly understood this truth.

Lingxiao Sect's mighty blow had struck at cotton; it felt frustrating and suffocating.

"Since we've come, we won't leave empty-handed. Burn Lei Feng Canyon to the ground." Yang Kai snorted, "If Fang Peng doesn't want this ten-thousand-year legacy, we have no reason to keep it for him."

"Brutal!" Qian Tong's mouth twitched.

Orders were passed down and the Crystal Cannons fired relentlessly; as the warship advanced, everything in their path was leveled.

The thunderous roar never ceased, and the many buildings of Leitai Sect were pulverized beneath the Crystal Cannons.

Suddenly Yang Kai's expression shifted; he looked surprised and doubtful as his Divine Sense probed toward a certain direction.

There, an intense energy fluctuation appeared — it didn't feel like a Secret Treasure, but rather as if a mass of Saint Crystals had been piled together.

Had Leitai Sect, in their haste, left the Saint Crystals behind, or was it a trap?

No one despises more Saint Crystals. An energy fluctuation so strong meant the Saint Crystals were likely on the order of over one hundred million — a formidable fortune even for Leitai Sect.

"There's something over there; I'll go take a look." Yang Kai stood up.

"Sect Master, be wary of deception." Ye Xijun's brow furrowed.

"No matter." Yang Kai grinned, "It's certainly a trap, but I want to see what game Fang Peng is playing. Stay aboard the warship; I'll be right back."

Saying that, Yang Kai leapt from the warship and dashed toward where the energy came from.

Before long he arrived before a palace. Under the scrutiny of his Divine Sense, the interior was plain to see.

It was empty save for some tables and chairs, but beneath the palace lay a secret chamber piled high with countless upper-level Saint Crystals.

There were indeed over one hundred million of them.

Such vast wealth he could not bear to leave behind. Bold because of his skill, he did not hesitate. He entered the palace, searched for a moment, found a hidden doorway in a corner, and went straight down.

Moments later Yang Kai stood in the secret chamber. At a glance his eyes lit up. Having confirmed there was nothing suspicious around, he waved his hand and began loading the Saint Crystals into his Spatial Ring.

At the same time, about ten thousand zhang below Leitai Sect's main headquarters, another secret chamber existed.

Seated there were five extremely aged elders; each had white hair and beard, looking withered to the extreme, their life force all but spent.

Yet each of these five was an expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

They sat at the five points of a pentagonal formation, and in the center there had been a preset array — a formation of profound subtlety that exuded an ominously dangerous aura.

They made no sound and their Saint Yuan was concealed and invisible, sitting there as if they were five corpses.

But the instant Yang Kai entered the secret chamber, the five seemed to sense it and all opened their eyes.

"Someone's come!" one yellow-faced elder murmured.

"Indeed—I suppose they've some nerve." an aged matronslightly nodded.

“Since they’re here, let’s make our move,” the third person said calmly. “The Battle Sky Alliance didn't withstand that Void King-Grade Warship, and my Leitai Sect likely couldn’t either. But as for claiming this ten-thousand-year foundation—let’s see if he can survive long enough to take it.”

"Heh, with the Profound Yin Ten-Directional Array, I suspect even if he survives the taking, he won't survive enjoying it."

"Enough idle talk. Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters, meeting and knowing you these past centuries has been this old man's honor. Now it is time for us to part; may your journeys be well!" the yellow-faced elder who first spoke said again.

His words carried weight, and the others' faces likewise took on solemnity.

The aged matron looked at him and smiled: "Senior Brother, likewise."

The yellow-faced elder's expression flickered with remembrance, but he hardened his features and quietly cried, "Form the array!"

As the words fell, he poured his Saint Yuan into the pentagonal array before them frantically.

The other four did the same.

The pentagonal formation suddenly burst forth with dazzling light. As the light intensified, the array's lines seemed to come alive and began to spin, turning faster and faster.

As the array rotated, the five grew deathly pale in an instant, the little remaining life force draining away rapidly.

The formation did not merely absorb their Saint Yuan — it seemed to siphon away their very life essence.

A muffled shout escaped as the five poured out their last strength.

Suddenly the formation quivered and the whirling array detached from its place, shooting upward and vanishing into the earth in the blink of an eye.

Seeing this, the five smiled faintly but slumped to the ground, emaciated to skin and bone, clearly not long for this world.

At the same time, in the secret chamber piled with Saint Crystals, Yang Kai's movements faltered and worry creased his brow.

In that instant he felt unease well up in his heart.

Before he could think further, a violent energy fluctuation erupted from beneath his feet, and a massive array diagram shot up from below, covering the entire secret chamber. Lines of the formation hardened like iron bars, turning the chamber into a prison.

Fierce energy rippled outward as blinding light shot up from beneath countless Saint Crystals, filling him with an alarming sense of dread.

Yang Kai seemed to sense something. With a sudden wave of his hand, he swept aside countless Saint Crystals, revealing beneath them a massive crimson Crystal Stone, half the height of a man. At this moment, dazzling red light was radiating from within it, and that violent surge of energy was emanating straight from its core.

"Xuanbao Crystal!" Yang Kai's eye twitched and he hissed in realization, "So that's it!"

Leitai Sect had spent over one hundred million Saint Crystals to set up such a trap, making even those who suspected a snare unwilling to resist the temptation.

After all, everyone has greed!

But once one stepped into this place, one would fall into Leitai Sect's scheme.

The earlier formation had only served to bind and trap him; the true killing blow lay hidden beneath those Saint Crystals — the Xuanbao Crystal!

Such things are rare treasures; their internal energy is extremely unstable and liable to erupt with the slightest disturbance. Normally they have little use and, because they are scarce, are seldom employed by cultivators.

Truly impressive of the Leitai Sect—who knows where they managed to find such a massive piece. And this wasn’t the only one; beneath the cover of those Saint Crystals, at least four or five other spots were also faintly glowing red.

Such an energy eruption might overwhelm even a Void King Realm expert who personally came here, let alone Yang Kai.

Leitai Sect truly held him in high regard!

As the thought passed, the red light exploded violently. In the next moment a roar of shattering sounded, shaking heaven and earth, and the whole secret chamber was obliterated in an instant.

A pillar of red light shot up from underground to the heavens, and Leitai Sect's main headquarters was torn to ruins in the ferocious blast.

The shockwaves rolled outward, stripping the land of sand and rock and blotting out sun and moon where they passed.

Tens of li away, everyone aboard the warship stared in disbelief, their eyes trembling.

Even Ye Xijun turned ashen; fortunately her temperament was resolute. Seeing the terrifying shockwave heading toward the warship, she cried out sharply: "Shields up!"

Soon a thin membranous shield appeared around the warship.

A violent gale rose, and the blast engulfed the warship, whipping it about and slamming it hard against the gorge's cliffside.

Everyone aboard could barely keep their footing, faces stricken with horror, and all rushed to circulate their Saint Yuan to protect themselves and invoke Secret Treasures for defense.
