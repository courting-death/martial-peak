## Chapter 385 — You Are Not My Match

“Move, and it will be you, the Yang Family!” The Eighth Stage expert in the Divine Roaming Realm, engulfed in battle with two Blood Servants, sneered viciously, “The Yang Family flaunts its power, believing itself untouchable. This time, I will ensure the complete annihilation of your Yang Family!”

His tone was venomous, as if he harbored deep grudges against the Yang Family.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's expressions darkened. They realized this was no chance encounter, but rather a well-planned ambush targeting the Yang Family.

Their opponents numbered three. Even though the two Blood Servants were anxious to rush to Yang Kai's aid, they couldn't do so immediately.

“Yuxian!” Tu Feng suddenly shouted, knowing time was precious and unwilling to delay further.

“Understood.” Tang Yuxian twisted her body as a fierce and surging True Essence erupted, enveloping the entire area in mist. Simultaneously, her powerful Divine Sense struck, unleashing a formidable soul attack against the weakest opponent in the Divine Roaming Realm.

The two Blood Servants, anxious to protect their master, clearly revealed their hidden capabilities.

The three adversaries combined effortlessly countered Tang Yuxian's soul attack, but were simultaneously wrapped in mist, unable to see a way out. Upon feeling the intense fluctuations of Tu Feng's blood and energy, the leading Divine Roaming Realm expert's expression changed dramatically. He shouted, “Damn it! The Yang Family's Blood Servants are indeed all maniacs. It’s the Blood Fury Technique! Quickly, stop him!”

Blood Fury Technique, a miraculous martial skill unique to the Yang Family's Blood Servants!

By using this technique, the Blood Servants' blood energy would temporarily increase two to three times. While their realm would not change, their defensive and offensive capabilities would dramatically enhance.

This was reminiscent of Yang Kai's blood power transformation after entering the Demonic State.

However, the Blood Fury Technique was not as potent as the Demonic State, as it bore the risk of backlash. The Blood Servants were overdrawing their vitality to amplify their blood energy.

Once unleashed, the Blood Servants would become unstoppable for a brief period. Yet, once the effect wore off, they would become extremely weakened.

The battle had scarcely begun, yet Tu Feng decisively employed this forbidden technique, revealing his urgency, which genuinely startled the three Divine Roaming Realm experts.

They had not expected Tu Feng's dedication to protecting his master to be so intense, showing no regard for his own potential injuries.

Recognizing time was short, the three attacked with no reservations, aiming to rapidly defeat Tang Yuxian before turning to Tu Feng.

However, Tang Yuxian was also a member of the Blood Servants, her strength was indisputable. With all her treasures summoned forth, she managed to hold the three at bay, rendering them immobile.

“Move quickly!” With no way to break through Tang Yuxian's defenses, the Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert yelled furiously to the others.

Meanwhile, among those pursuing Yang Kai, the leading middle-aged man possessed strength equal to the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. He was flanked by a First Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert, along with two Ninth Stage True Essence Realm practitioners.

Such a lineup could easily kill any Seventh Stage True Essence martial artist.

But not Yang Kai!

Hearing the angry shouts from the other side, the middle-aged man's expression soured; he quickly propelled his soul technique toward Yang Kai.

An invisible force broke through the air, directly piercing into Yang Kai's mind.

While rushing forward, Yang Kai's body trembled. Suddenly, his True Essence faltered, and he began to plummet from midair.

“Humph!” The middle-aged man let out a cold grunt, flashing alongside his companions to swiftly encircle Yang Kai.

“This is the young master of the Yang Family?” The First Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert looked disdainfully at the fallen, pained Yang Kai, sneering, “Not impressive at all. I thought this would present some challenge, but it seems so simple!”

The middle-aged man snorted heavily, stating, “You underestimate the Yang Family. He may be weak now, but once he grows to your realm, even I might not be able to win.”

The Divine Roaming Realm expert showed slight skepticism but did not rebut, merely nodding, “A pity he’s still in the True Essence Realm, destined to be easily subdued!”

Confronting someone in the Divine Roaming Realm proved exceedingly simple. If the latter didn’t possess treasures to defend against soul attacks, they would struggle to withstand the assault.

Hence, the young masters and misses of influential families had to at least bear one such treasure, as those forces possessed the resources to arm their crucial members adequately.

“Quit the chatter, kill him quickly! Delays may lead to unforeseen changes!” The middle-aged man, seeing Yang Kai unable to fight back, ordered curtly without further talk.

The First Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert shrugged disinterestedly, grinning, “Fine, leave the offending deed to me.”

As he spoke, he approached Yang Kai, extending a foot to stomp on Yang Kai's chest while positioning his weapon at the boy's neck, preparing to stab down fiercely.

Yang Kai's eyes were unfocused, his pain evident as if he truly had no power to resist, resigned to fate.

Just then.

A shocking light burst forth from his vacant eyes. A flash of violet ghostly light darted toward the First Stage Divine Roaming Realm martial artist’s mind.

Chilling, cold, and filled with an aura of sheer malevolence, the force exploded in his sea of consciousness.

The weapon he held, only inches from Yang Kai's neck, was poised to strike down. The man wore a casual smile as if his victory was assured.

Yet, he could no longer descend with the weapon. The soul technique he had acquired from the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave detonated in his mind instantaneously, freezing him in place. A sudden chill flooded his head, as though his entire sea of consciousness had been encased in ice.

Yang Kai struck suddenly.

A series of violet ghostly lights erupted in all directions, creating ripples that engulfed the middle-aged expert of the Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm and the two Ninth Stage True Essence Realm youths.

The middle-aged man, caught off guard, instinctively recoiled, his eyes trembling violently, almost unable to believe his senses. The two True Essence Realm practitioners, however, screamed in pain, kneeling and clutching their heads.

“Boom…”

A muffled sound reverberated as Yang Kai's fist connected with the chest of the First Stage Divine Roaming Realm martial artist. His back visibly bulged outward, as if all the ribs in his chest had shattered, protruding into his heart and lungs, while the raging True Yang Yuan Qi detonated within him.

Without a sound, the man’s eyes dimmed.

In that instant, a First Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert met his demise!

Yang Kai sprung up, like a gale, reaching the two Ninth Stage True Essence Realm youths, his expression cold as ice. He grasped their heads, twisting brutally!

With two crackling sounds, the youths' heads turned grotesquely backward, their necks snapping as they fell lifeless.

The middle-aged man had only regained his balance when Yang Kai had already killed three!

Their eyes met; Yang Kai's demeanor was glacial, a peculiar smile on his lips. The middle-aged man turned pale, his gaze filled with horror.

Because of his momentary carelessness, three capable fighters had been lost just like that.

Even more unbelievable was that he clearly felt his soul attack had struck Yang Kai, yet why was he unharmed?

There had been no sign of a treasure to defend against soul attacks, and he had distinctly penetrated Yang Kai's mind.

How could he come away unscathed? Even a peak Divine Roaming Realm expert would at least feel some impact from his assault, right?

But looking at Yang Kai's reaction, it seemed he hadn’t been affected at all.

Furthermore, what had just happened? That icy, malevolent soul attack?

“Boy, you dare to play the pig to eat the tiger!” the middle-aged man roared, anger brewing in his voice.

Yang Kai chuckled, his contempt clear as he replied, “And what if I do?”

Indeed, what of it? You lay in wait here, overwhelming the weak with numbers, threatening the helpless. Is it forbidden for others to play the fool and catch tigers?

What kind of logic was that?

The middle-aged man's face turned ashen; he suddenly grinned savagely, “Good! Truly, the Yang Family breeds only the extraordinary! But today, you are destined to die!”

Yang Kai observed the shifting expressions, realizing the man spoke ill yet made no move. Instead, he regarded him warily, clearly understanding that the previous split-second clash had left him bewildered.

This man was undoubtedly cautious, hence the wariness.

“You are not my match!” Yang Kai declared coldly and unhurriedly.

The middle-aged man froze, evidently not expecting such bold words. He responded with a frigid gaze, “Even if you are of the Yang Family, that statement is too arrogant. I’m a Divine Roaming Realm expert…”

“What of a Divine Roaming Realm expert?” Yang Kai stepped forward toward him, casually and nonchalantly, showing no hint of concern. “I just killed one in front of you.”

The middle-aged man's expression turned incredulous as he gaped at Yang Kai, suddenly losing his composure, his face exhibiting a perplexed look.

“Not just that one; you, at the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, will surely die at my hands today,” Yang Kai stated mockingly, “What a shame, though you have decent cultivation, your understanding of soul techniques seems lacking. You must not have trained for long, right? Otherwise, you could never overlook the fact that I am completely unharmed. In fact, I can tell you, my Divine Sense is even stronger than yours!”

“Absurd!” The middle-aged man sneered, regaining his composure and expressing disbelief at such absurdity.

Before he could finish speaking, an incredibly fierce Divine Sense swept over him.

This surge of Divine Sense was so powerful that it surpassed that of an ordinary Seventh or Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert, effectively matching even peak-level Divine Sense!

No, it could already rival the typical peak Divine Roaming Realm's Divine Sense!

Up to this point, the middle-aged man had only sensed such intense Divine Sense from a handful of individuals, all of whom were pinnacle experts of the Divine Roaming Realm!

Just as he had stabilized his nerves, they began to tremble again!
