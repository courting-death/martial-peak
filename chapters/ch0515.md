## Chapter 515 — Closing In

Faced with Yang Kai’s inquiry, not a single person dared answer; only the fierce beating of their hearts echoed within their chests.

After a moment of waiting, Yang Kai lost patience and coldly said, “If none of you speak, every one of you will die. If you speak, I can spare your lives!”

“He is from the Xiang Family!” Immediately, someone unable to withstand such immense pressure pointed at a person beside him.

That person could not help but curse angrily and fled on foot.

A blood-red petal fluttered from the corpse of the man who had just died. Like lightning, it shot into the fleeing man’s back of the head, piercing through his entire skull.

With a thud, the man fell to the ground, rolling several times before gradually falling still.

“Anyone else?” Yang Kai asked again.

Everyone shook their heads continuously, indicating that no one else from the Xiang or Nan families remained here.

Yang Kai slightly nodded and ceased his questioning. The next moment, he vanished from the sight of the crowd.

Seeing that he truly kept his word and spared them, the remaining warriors finally gasped deeply, their bodies weakly collapsing to the ground, drenched in sweat. The breeze dragged a chill across their skin.

“Don’t let me see you in War City again!” In the distance, Yang Kai’s voice carried over…

Startled again, the people hurriedly nodded: “Understood, understood!”

After this, they dared not return to War City. After enduring what had just happened, no one had the courage to face this murderous Young Master of the Yang Family!

He alone was capable of such deeds, and yet his household possessed many powerful aides. Originally, this group had placed their hopes on Yang Zhao, believing he could rely on numbers and amassed forces to win the Succession War and that they could feast on his victories.

But now, no one dared think that way.

A moment later, fifty li away, Yang Kai killed three more warriors from the Xiang and Nan families, leaving behind a group of broken survivors before continuing on.

He was not someone who blindly slaughtered without cause; he knew when to be firm and when to show mercy.

Just as he had not allowed Su Yan to kill four Divine Roaming Realm warriors from the Qiu and Kang families, mindful of the complex interrelations among the Eight Great Families.

But this time, he was truly angered by Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng.

These two had opposed him since the Succession War began. Previously, Yang Kai paid them no mind—after all, differing principles meant no alliance. Since they participated in the Succession War, conflict was natural; if they killed his people, he killed theirs—it was righteous justice.

But this time was different. Those people represented Lingxiao Pavilion’s last foundation and hope for revival.

Moreover, he had made an agreement with Kang Zhan. Yet Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu still dared to attack them.

Yang Kai obviously would not let those from the Xiang and Nan families go unpunished.

He intended to let the world know that Lingxiao Pavilion was truly not to be trifled with.

Continuing his relentless pursuit and slaughter, he killed every person from the Xiang and Nan families without mercy, leaving a bloody trail behind.

After a day and night, Yang Kai sped across two thousand li and at last saw the figures of Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng far ahead.

The two were fleeing desperately with a group, never stopping for rest. Now their True Yuan was nearly depleted; they gasped heavily.

They had thought they would safely return to War City, and had run swiftly to prepare against danger. Who would have thought Yang Kai would truly chase them relentlessly?

Feeling the killing intent and overwhelming bloodiness approaching from behind, the group glanced back in horror, faces turning pale. “Ninth Young Master is closing in.”

“What?” Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu’s expressions immediately darkened. They hurried to look back and truly saw Yang Kai’s figure streaking like a meteor, closing the distance.

“Is he mad?” Nan Sheng was stunned. “All this just for a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion? Is it worth it?”

Xiang Chu’s face turned gloomy, showing deep helplessness and wariness. He nodded lightly: “I fear we’ve truly touched his reverse scale!”

“Brother Xiang, what now?” Nan Sheng wiped sweat from his brow nervously. “You quickly come up with a plan!”

“Return to War City. There is no other way. Once we reach the residence of the Second Young Master, we will be safe,” Xiang Chu gritted his teeth and increased his speed.

Nan Sheng cursed silently. That advice was effectively useless—right now, the key was how to escape Yang Kai’s relentless pursuit alive.

Their group was exhausted from fleeing day and night. Whether they could outrun him was uncertain. Judging by Yang Kai’s speed, it seemed hopeless.

Where did this bastard get so much True Yuan to squander? After so long a chase, his aura remained fierce and spirited, determined not to give up.

Before further complaints could rise, Nan Sheng quickly swallowed several pills to replenish his True Yuan and likewise accelerated.

“You will not escape.” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly sounded from behind, making everyone’s hearts jump. “None of the people from the Xiang and Nan families will survive!”

“Ninth Young Master, we are neither from the Xiang nor Nan families!” A young leader from one faction could no longer bear the pressure behind and shouted out.

“Then I will kill the Xiang and Nan family members around you, and spare the rest!” Yang Kai replied coldly.

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng’s faces immediately changed, eyes flashing with intense vigilance as they looked around fearfully, worried these people might turn against them.

Together, those from the Xiang and Nan families numbered only around seventy—first slaughtered by Yang Kai, then scattered during the escape. Fewer than twenty now clustered near them, while others from different factions outnumbered them by two or three times.

If these people truly took Yang Kai’s words to heart and attacked them, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng feared they would face disaster.

Fortunately, the others merely hesitated at Yang Kai’s proposal. After all, they belonged to the same camp as the Xiang and Nan families. Yang Kai’s sudden words made them unwilling to kill them outright.

Sensing their hesitation, Xiang Chu shouted loudly: “Everyone, the Xiang and Nan families are well-known clans. If you attack us here, consider well the consequences.”

Those with doubtful expressions soon sobered. If they were enemies, killing each other would be natural, but now all belonged to Yang Zhao’s banner. If they fought secretly, word would spread and their own clans would lose standing.

Compared to their lives, family honor was far more important.

Besides, whether Yang Kai could catch them was uncertain. Even if he caught up, he would first go after the Xiang and Nan family members. They would still have a chance to flee.

“Young Master Nan, Young Master Xiang, rest assured we will not turn on you,” someone immediately replied.

“That is best,” Xiang Chu nodded slightly, relieved.

Yang Kai seemed to have noticed their exchange and changing expressions, sneering coldly, “If you’re unwilling to openly clash with the Xiang and Nan families, I won’t force you. Just block Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng for me, and I won’t trouble you further. Otherwise, you will bear the consequences!”

The previously eased mood suddenly grew tense again.

Yang Kai’s proposal was indeed tempting compared to his previous one. Just some mild obstruction of Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu—no killing—and they could accept it.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu realized danger and hastily led their people away from the others.

Nan Sheng was furious, roaring, “Yang Kai, do you really think you’re so great? If I weren’t worried about your identity, I wouldn’t be chased by you!”

Yang Kai sneered, “I learned that at Taifang Mountain. Yours is just bullying the weak. You like to rank people, don’t you? Acting arrogantly at Taifang Mountain, taking lives at will? What, when facing me—a scion of a supreme family—you only know how to run?”

The harsh sarcasm rendered Nan Sheng speechless.

At Taifang Mountain, he had been arrogant and overbearing, bullying Yang Kai and the people of Fengyu Tower’s Blood Battle Gang, even forcing the Hu family sisters, showing an utterly ugly face.

Fortunately, when Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian arrived and revealed Yang Kai’s true identity, his arrogance and that of Xiang Chu immediately dissipated. Otherwise, the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower would have suffered heavy casualties. Yang Kai, even if he escaped, would have paid a heavy price.

Old grudges and new hatreds were due for reckoning. Yang Kai had no patience to spar any longer with these two insignificant men.

“Trouble! Ninth Young Master is catching up!” someone shouted.

Many warriors turned to look, their expressions changing drastically. They noticed that while Yang Kai had been speaking with Nan Sheng, he had silently closed a great distance. Soon, he would truly catch up.

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng panicked as well.

Behind them, a surging power fluctuated—it seemed Yang Kai was preparing a killing strike.

This discovery made everyone even more helpless. The Earth-Shattering Strike unleashed by the Bone Shield was still vivid in their memories. Naturally, they feared he would unleash another such devastating attack.

Rustling wind swept behind them, sword qi chilling the air.

Thousands upon thousands of sword energies made from True Yuan aligned in rows like a storm of arrows, fiercely attacking in their direction.

This all-out, indiscriminate assault immediately blocked their escape.

These warriors had no choice but to turn and deploy Martial Skills and Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures to fend off the onslaught.

After a round of defense, several weaker warriors fell to the ground.

Xiang Chu’s expression grew extremely grim, realizing they could not escape Yang Kai’s pursuit this way—he was much faster.

“Elders, I’m afraid we must trouble you to block him for a while!” His expression suddenly firm, Xiang Chu turned to several Divine Roaming Realm elites nearby.

These were the last Divine Roaming Realm experts of the combined Xiang and Nan families, the highest only reaching the Fourth Stage, but their number was considerable—seven in total.
