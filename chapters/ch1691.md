## Chapter 1691 — Reentering the Corpse Den

After outlining his plan to Qian Tong, Qian Tong agreed at once.

He also understood the principle of capturing the leader to defeat the band—strike the man and the rest fall; over the past two years the Corpse Spirit Sect had grown like a rolling snowball, its power swelling ever greater, with countless converted members of the Corpse Spirit Race and human cultivators flocking to its banner. Trying to exterminate them all would be near impossible; it was far better to strike at the heart and eliminate the sect’s mysterious leader.

After Qian Tong resumed command of Yingyue Hall he investigated the Corpse Spirit Sect and all signs pointed to Zangxiong Valley as the root of everything—undoubtedly the place where the Corpse Spirit Sect rose and originated.

He had been considering whether to go to Zangxiong Valley to scout matters himself; now, having Yang Kai confirm it, there was nothing to hesitate over. The two men instantly found accord, left Lingxiao Sect, and set off for Zangxiong Valley.

This trip Yang Kai brought no followers—only he and Qian Tong traveled together. Even Su Yan he left behind in Lingxiao Sect.

Qian Tong was already a Void King Realm expert, so his speed was naturally astonishing; Yang Kai’s strength was lower, but he excelled in Spatial Force, and for pure travel speed he was no slower than Qian Tong.

In no more than ten days they arrived at Zangxiong Valley.

The last time Yang Kai and Yang Yan had come here the valley had been full of oppressive yin and alluring ghostly energy that made any cultivator within uneasy, yet it had at least been tolerable.

But now, when Yang Kai and Qian Tong arrived and peered down into the void below, both of them couldn’t help but knit their brows.

Beneath them was a thick pall of mist that shrouded the entire Zangxiong Valley, rendering it almost pitch black; the fog was of the utmost yin and cold, containing poisonous Corpse Qi.

Any living person who entered it without sufficient strength would soon find that the omnipresent Corpse Qi invaded their body and began converting them into one of the Corpse Spirit Race.

Through their Divine Sense, both of them sensed numerous living auras hidden within the corpse miasma—surging and active.

These were, without doubt, members of the Corpse Spirit Race!

That was only the outskirts; there were at least thousands there. It was hard to imagine how many such existences lurked within Zangxiong Valley itself.

“We’ll split up. Yang Kai, if you encounter the head of the Corpse Spirit Sect, send me word. I’ll go clear a path first—there are simply too many of these things.” Qian Tong warned, then transformed into a streak of light and tore into Zangxiong Valley like a thunderbolt. Where his light passed came the terrifying sounds of storm and cracking thunder; in the valley filled with Corpse Qi he carved out a clear, visible channel.

All around, the Corpse Spirits were thrown into chaos. Qian Tong didn’t even appear to move—he merely released his Domain Field. Infused with the power of the Wind Element, that domain swept through an area of over ten li, dragging every Corpse Spirit within into its grasp and grinding them into dust.

He clearly had no intention of hiding his movements—he was boldly and brazenly cutting his way in!

Yang Kai smiled faintly and paid it little mind.

With Qian Tong’s current strength, the Dark Star had no one left who could give him pause; he was fully entitled to act like this.

Moreover, Qian Tong’s actions would draw the attention of the Corpse Spirit Sect and create opportunities for Yang Kai to act.

This had been the plan the two men discussed on the way here.

In only a short time, those thousands of Corpse Spirit Race that both Yang Kai and Qian Tong had detected were all annihilated—none survived. The hand of a Void King Realm expert could be glimpsed! Yet Qian Tong was not satisfied and strode ever deeper; more and more of the Corpse Spirit Race were lured out and swept into his domain, dying in mysterious and bloody fashion.

While Qian Tong’s ferocious assault drew most of the Corpse Spirit Sect’s attention, Yang Kai vanished from his original position.

Following the memories of his previous exploration, he pushed deeper inward.

The Corpse Spirit Sect’s origin lay in an Underworld Spring Source inside the Corpse Den—that was the Sect’s fundamental core. Yang Kai intended to head straight for the Corpse Den; if he could destroy that Underworld Spring Source, the Corpse Spirit Sect would be a tree without roots and a spring without source, and utterly uprooting them would become far simpler. If the Underworld Spring Source remained, no matter how many of the Corpse Spirit Race were killed, more could still be converted.

Thunderous sounds came from afar—shouts and roars of combat—Qian Tong was fighting the Corpse Spirit Sect’s masters. Yang Kai had not seen the scene, but he knew Qian Tong must be cutting a bloody path; the Corpse Spirit Race was in retreat.

In half a day’s time he reached the entrance to the Corpse Den.

Along the way he encountered a few members of the Corpse Spirit Race, but these small fry could not halt his progress; they were all cut down cleanly.

The entrance to the Corpse Den had not changed; it remained unhidden behind an old concealment array, yet that array had been broken by Yang Yan before and now was of little use.

Inside the Corpse Den, waves of dense Corpse Qi billowed forth; its concentration and corrosive power far exceeded that of Zangxiong Valley. Yang Kai sent out Divine Sense to probe, then calmly leapt into the Den.

The Corpse Den was darker and damper than before. As Yang Kai sensed, stone chambers were strewn throughout the Den, and there were many traces of Corpse Spirit Race activity.

But Qian Tong’s commotion outside had been so loud the Corpse Spirit Race within the Den were alarmed and continuously pouring outward to reinforce those battles.

After entering, Yang Kai immediately hid in a nearby stone chamber and avoided that wave of Corpse Spirit Race.

His task now was to find the mysterious Sect leader; he had no desire to reveal himself too early.

The Corpse Spirit Race did not discover him. When they left, Yang Kai frowned and surveyed his surroundings with a sense of unease.

The stone chamber was pitch-black without a glimmer of light, but that did not hinder Yang Kai’s observation.

Upon closer inspection, Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

He discovered that the chamber stored many intact corpses, each wrapped in dense Corpse Qi like silkworm cocoons. Under the nourishment and influence of that qi, the bodies were undergoing subtle, imperceptible changes, gradually edging toward becoming members of the Corpse Spirit Race.

Some of the corpses were already half-converted! Once they fully absorbed the cocoon-like Corpse Qi covering them, they would inevitably become one of the Corpse Spirit Race.

Sure enough. Yang Kai nodded slightly.

He had previously suspected how the Corpse Spirit Race transformed new members: every converted member needed an intact corpse as a base. Those bodies obviously came from disciples of major forces and sects that the Corpse Spirit Race had slain.

They transported those corpses back to the Corpse Den and used the Den’s concentrated Corpse Qi as the source for conversion; in a short time a new member could be produced.

There were also failed conversions. In the chamber Yang Kai found some half-formed husks with no trace of spirit—those had failed and their souls were utterly scattered.

The power of a successfully converted Corpse Spirit Race member correlated directly with their cultivation in life: the higher they had reached, the stronger they were in death. That was why in Tianyun City the Corpse Spirit Race member called Fang Fengqi needed Fei Zhi Tu’s body.

Fei Zhi Tu had, after all, once been among the experts of the Dark Star.

The corpses stored in this chamber had not had high cultivation in life—below Saint King Realm, mostly Saint Realm, and even some Transcendent Realm Divine Roaming levels—a mixed lot.

Those converted were merely pawns of the Corpse Spirit Sect’s army, numbers without real quality.

But within this Corpse Den the stone chambers were countless. Yang Kai guessed that the farther in he went, the higher the cultivation of the corpses shelved in the chambers.

He did not linger and pressed onward.

Soon he found his guess was right: deeper in, the corpses’ former cultivation rose—from Saint Realm to Saint King Realm, and even to Origin Returning Realm.

Though their numbers thinned as the quality rose.

Yang Kai even witnessed a fully converted Corpse Spirit Race crawl out from its cocoon-like shell as if reborn. It howled to the sky, exuding a nauseating stench, two fang-like teeth at its mouth chilling to look at, and its body bristling with needle-fine white hair.

Having just completed conversion it clearly did not yet know how to control its strength.

Yang Kai continued deeper without alerting any Corpse Spirits, and gradually approached the place where the Sun's True Essence had once been obtained.

That place had once been the treasure vault of the Guyang Sect — three layers in total, with the innermost one housing the Sun’s True Essence and the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade Platform.

Standing outside the treasure vault, Yang Kai suddenly frowned. Lifting his head, he cast a deep, penetrating glance inside. Then, the corner of his mouth curved slightly upward as he strode forward, walking in at an unhurried pace.

On the first and second layers Corpse Spirit Race stood along both sides—these were all Origin Returning Realm in cultivation. But when Yang Kai entered they did not immediately attack; instead they stared at him with ferocious eyes, snarling to intimidate as he walked inward. After he passed they suddenly surged forward and blocked his retreat.

Yang Kai went straight to the third layer of the treasure vault.

The third layer vault had been completely transformed into something else: richly decorated in gold and jade, magnificent and luxurious. fist-sized luminous pearls were embedded in the surrounding walls, emitting a gentle glow. The whole third layer vault had clearly become a splendid palace.

In the center of that palace was a pool roughly three feet across, its yellow waters constantly churning and bubbling.

Yang Kai’s gaze paused over that pool for an instant and he immediately understood: this was the legendary Underworld Spring Source! That yellow pool was not ordinary liquid but the direct, concentrated manifestation of pure energy.

This energy was harmful to most people and even dangerous, but it had tremendous efficacy for the Corpse Spirit Race.

Yang Kai even sensed a peculiar fluctuation of spatial power from the Underworld Spring Source.

This raised suspicions in his mind, though he could not be certain.

He shook his head slightly, looked up, and stared at the figure seated upon the chair ahead.
