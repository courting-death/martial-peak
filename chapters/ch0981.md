## Chapter 981 — Remember My Face

In the side chamber, on the incense-scented bed, Xia Ningshang was lost in a haze of desire.

Yang Kai did not grope or touch her in a coarse way, yet his words brimming with tenderness and honeyed intent caused her to lower all defenses, her whole being carried aloft like a cloud, drifting with the wind, rising and falling; her delicate body twisted unconsciously, a restrained little moan escaping her throat.

Her beautiful eyes were misted, her gaze unfocused, and a great wave of satisfaction flushed across her pretty face.

Yang Kai bent down and kissed her eyes, her small nose, moving with the utmost care as if handling a priceless work of art, never once making an excessive motion.

She turned her head away; her dainty, exquisite earlobe blazed crimson as she trembled and whispered, "Junior Brother… before you leave, will you remember what I look like?"

Yang Kai froze for a moment, then inclined his head slightly.

It had been more than ten years since he first met Xia Ningshang, yet he had truly never seen Little Senior Sister's face until now.

At all times and in all places, Little Senior Sister wore a gauze veil over her face so that no one could clearly make out her features.

At first Yang Kai had been curious about what kind of face she hid, but as time passed he no longer cared.

Whether that face was ravishingly beautiful or utterly plain, Little Senior Sister would always be Little Senior Sister—no one could take her place.

She possessed the purest pair of eyes in the world; that was enough.

Unexpectedly, before parting, Xia Ningshang volunteered to reveal herself, and Yang Kai naturally would not refuse.

Saying that, Xia Ningshang unfastened the thin veil that had concealed her features.

A breeze outside the window lifted the veil and sent it drifting toward the head of the bed.

Xia Ningshang closed her eyes, a little nervous as she straightened her head so her face would be completely unveiled under Yang Kai's gaze.

Yang Kai examined her carefully; his whole body trembled violently, a flash of astonishment crossing his eyes.

Even with all the mental preparation he had made, the instant he saw Xia Ningshang’s true face, he still couldn’t help but lose his composure.

Little Senior Sister’s looks were not the most beautiful Yang Kai had ever seen—whether Su Yan or Shan Qingluo, both could rival her—but she possessed a temperament all her own.

Like Su Yan's coldness or Shan Qingluo's alluring charm, Little Senior Sister carried a sanctified aura.

It seemed that more than twenty years of life had left no trace on her.

A delicate jade nose, cheeks faintly flushed like peaches, two small rosy lips, a makeup-free face dappled with a gentle glow, skin like snow and jade, tender and fair.

Like most beauties, every part of her body was exquisitely flawless.

Yet when these flawless parts combined, they produced an unexpected transformation.

Purity and innocent charm intertwined, making Yang Kai feel she was stern and untouchable, yet naïve and untested by the world.

Yang Kai had traveled far and wide for many years and seen countless beauties, but never had any woman struck him with such a powerful visual impact as Xia Ningshang.

At the moment he saw her true face, an impulse surged within Yang Kai that he found hard to suppress.

He wanted to pull Xia Ningshang close, fold her into his body, take her with him and never let her go.

The thought rushed up and Yang Kai quickly drew a deep breath to suppress the surge, a puzzled look rising on his face.

He was not a man without restraint; on the contrary, he could control himself and regulate his actions—he had considerable self-discipline.

Still, the thought persisted.

Yang Kai could not imagine how other men might react if they were shown Xia Ningshang's face.

"Master told me a long time ago… not to reveal my face lightly, so I've worn the veil all these years," Xia Ningshang explained softly, blushing under Yang Kai's burning gaze and looking somewhat ashamed.

"Shopkeeper Meng was right," Yang Kai said, nodding heavily as he toyed with Xia Ningshang's hair, half his body leaning over her, and spoke gently, "I think most men, when they see you, will have two impulses."

"Which two impulses?" Xia Ningshang, unbearably shy yet unable to suppress her curiosity, could not help asking.

"To protect or to violate!"

To protect her unworldly innocence, or to transgress her sanctity—either impulse fills a man with a tremendous sense of achievement.

The clash of those contradictory impulses will bring Xia Ningshang a lot of unnecessary trouble.

"What about you, Junior Brother?" Xia Ningshang suddenly mustered courage and looked straight at Yang Kai, eager to know the true thoughts of the man she cared for.

She could ignore anyone else's opinion but Yang Kai's.

"Me?" Yang Kai grinned wickedly. "Junior Brother is just one of the many men."

As he spoke he bent down and pressed a light kiss to Little Senior Sister's red lips.

"Mmm…" Xia Ningshang's slender body stiffened instantly; her beautiful eyes opened wide as if struck by a spiritual blow that threatened to shatter her mind—suddenly she lost control of her body, unable to move or speak.

Yet she was enveloped by immense happiness and satisfaction.

She closed her eyes and savored this long-awaited intoxicating moment; her chest hammered violently, like a war drum—powerful and steady.

Yang Kai kissed her gently; a large hand slipped beneath Little Senior Sister's garments and cupped the fullness of her chest, softly fondling and kneading, taking the exquisite jade-like orbs into his palm and feeling the astonishing springiness and fiery heat that they gave off.

Little Senior Sister's breathing grew harsher; a faint stinging came across her bosom where Yang Kai's thick calluses rubbed her tender skin.

That slight sting did not make her uncomfortable—instead it stimulated her nerves and soul and felt intensely pleasurable.

She couldn't help but wish time would stop at this instant and never flow again.

Slash...

Her clothes were undone and Xia Ningshang's delicate body trembled.

Countless times she had "slept" beside Yang Kai and Su Yan and thus already had some knowledge of those shameful matters; in the instant her garments were loosened she already knew what would come.

Her clothes in disarray, her breathing rapid.

In the moonlight, Little Senior Sister shone with a porcelain-like, graceful luster; Yang Kai did not rush forward but studied her carefully, imprinting everything into his mind and carving it into the depths of his soul.

He continued to kiss and caress, plucking at the strings of Xia Ningshang's heart.

He wanted to give Little Senior Sister the most perfect, most unforgettable night.

With his departure imminent, this was the only thing he could do; he did not want there to be any regrets.

The sheets gradually dampened; Little Senior Sister had lost all capacity for independent thought, her mouth unconsciously murmuring soft hums, her body twisting and making exquisite sounds, her skin flushed with an unusual glow.

Yang Kai rode and charged, spear in hand, beginning his assault.

His movements were ridiculously gentle.

The whole Saint Lord Courtyard seemed suffused with a hint of spring, as if dead wood had come to life and branches were budding...

Outside the Saint Lord Courtyard, a beautiful figure stood quietly, her eyes complexly fixed on the front.

Another pretty figure approached slowly; An Ling'er carried a lantern and drew near, the other woman unaware until An Ling'er cleared her throat, whereupon she started, trembling like a frightened rabbit and flushing scarlet.

"Miss Qiu, aren't you going to rest at this hour?" An Ling'er asked with a puzzled look at Qiu Yimeng, wondering why she was standing there.

"Mmm… I'm about to rest," Qiu Yimeng replied, stealing a glance toward the Saint Lord Courtyard and answering hastily.

"Are you looking for the Saint Lord?" An Ling'er noticed something and smiled understandingly. "If you have business with him, go in—you're not an outsider; he probably hasn't gone to bed yet."

"N...no." Qiu Yimeng hurriedly waved her hand. "I…I don't need to see him; I just came to look at… the stars!"

"The stars?" An Ling'er looked up and pursed her lips with a light laugh. "With the bright moon tonight, there hardly seem to be many stars."

Qiu Yimeng immediately blushed deeply.

"The Saint Lord will probably leave tomorrow and who knows when he'll return; if you miss tonight's chance, who knows how long you'll have to wait, Miss Qiu?" An Ling'er seemed to perceive Qiu Yimeng's thoughts and couldn't help trying to persuade her.

"I really didn't come looking for him," Qiu Yimeng said with an embarrassed expression.

An Ling'er kept smiling in a way that hinted at meaning; just as she was about to speak, a strange noise came from nearby, making her frown as she listened closely.

Qiu Yimeng also noticed and tilted her head, ears straining like windmills.

A moment later, both women's faces flushed crimson; they glanced at each other and felt extremely awkward.

"Ahem…" An Ling'er cleared her throat. "Since there's nothing else, I'll stay and watch the stars with you, Miss Qiu."

She felt too embarrassed to return to the Saint Lord Courtyard and sat down, pretending to look up at the sky.

Qiu Yimeng nodded and sat beside her.

The two fell silent, their hearts pounding wildly; from not far away came successive unusual sounds that seemed like sinister music filling their ears, making them uncomfortable and involuntarily press their legs together, their bodies tense.

"Heh… the weather's nice tonight," An Ling'er said, making small talk.

"Yes." Qiu Yimeng nodded absently in agreement, distracted.

The noises from over there seemed to grow louder; both girls felt a warm rush in their lower bellies, and when the night wind blew between their legs it felt cold and unpleasant, as if a mire had formed—this chill made their bodies even more sensitive.

"You'd never guess it!" An Ling'er said with an incredulous expression.

"Guess what?" Qiu Yimeng asked, turning her head.

"How such a composed young woman could go so wild now…"

"Heh…" Qiu Yimeng didn't know what to say.

"Are you not going in?" An Ling'er bit her red lip and suddenly said, "Now would be the perfect time—there's nothing to say."

"Ah…" Qiu Yimeng was startled and mortified. "How could I be so bold?"

"What's there to be ashamed of? If I were you, I'd rush in now and give him a good show!" An Ling'er egged her on, eager to stir up trouble.

"No way!" Qiu Yimeng waved her hands repeatedly. "I could never do such a thing."
