## Chapter 226 — Beast Soul Technique — White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal

In the center of a valley in a distant land, there was originally a massive deep pit. This pit was excavated by Yang Kai while searching for blood beads. As time passed, dust and sand swirled, and the pit had been mostly buried, leaving less than a zhang deep.

At this moment, the surroundings of the small pit were filled with surging killing intent. If one looked closely, they could faintly see that this killing intent was divided into two streams, engaged in a fierce battle, intertwining with each other.

The battle between the two streams of killing intent had lasted for an unknown duration, with neither side able to gain the upper hand.

One day, these two streams of killing intent suddenly surged towards the center, and in a silent instant, they vanished without a trace. The grayish world suddenly became clear, and the heavens and earth returned to their former clarity.

After a long while, accompanied by a sound, a figure suddenly flew out from the pit, its robust body as graceful as a spirit swallow, landing steadily on the ground.

Shaking off the dust, taking a deep breath, this person stood quietly in place, frowning in contemplation.

Yang Kai had finally emerged from his closed-door cultivation!

The lingering resentment of the two Demonic Beasts after their deaths had almost forcibly made him witness the entire course of their battle. This fight could truly be described as earth-shattering and unprecedented. Yang Kai watched as the two Demonic Beasts continuously clashed, getting injured and bleeding, yet persevering without the slightest fear, charging at each other time and again, dealing heavy blows to one another, ultimately leading to their mutual destruction.

It was a battle where they knew they would surely die yet pressed forward without hesitation; it was a fight that gambled the dignity and honor of the Demonic Beasts!

Before this, Yang Kai had not even known that Demonic Beasts possessed such spirit, equal to any powerful human. The fierce melee battle made Yang Kai, the sole spectator, feel his blood boil, gaining much insight.

Moreover, after the remnants of the two Demonic Beasts dissipated, Yang Kai faintly felt that something had increased within his body.

In life, the two Demonic Beasts could not determine a victor, and in death, they borrowed Yang Kai's body to duel once more, fulfilling their long-held wish. This could be a gift left to him by the two Demonic Beasts or perhaps his own comprehension—it's hard to say.

He spread his hands, looked down at them, organizing his chaotic thoughts, and urged the Primordial Qi within his body to circulate in a specific sequence.

Moments later, a faint roar of beasts echoed from within him. He thrust a palm forward, and a fiery red figure suddenly flew out with the palm wind.

The tiger's roar shook the heavens; it was a vividly lifelike ferocious tiger, purely composed of Primordial Qi. The tiger exuded an imposing aura, with its fangs glinting coldly, darting forward with incredible speed, opening its mouth to bite, exuding an air of invincibility.

With another palm strike, a majestic and powerful divine ox charged out, thundering and trampling the ground. Like a stampede of thousands of horses, it crushed everything in its path, turning all obstacles into powder, unstoppable!

Heaven-Shaking White Tiger. Earth-Splitting Divine Ox! However, at this moment, both the white tiger and divine ox were composed of Yang Kai's Primordial Qi, their entire forms a vibrant red, appearing even more filled with killing intent.

The two illusory figures dashed out for several hundred zhang before gradually dissipating into glowing light in the air.

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, then burst into hearty laughter, very satisfied with his gains.

This could already be considered a martial technique, albeit one obtained from the remnants of Demonic Beasts.

It could be said to be a type of Beast Soul Technique.

In the world, many martial techniques are modeled after the forms of Demonic Beasts. Back when he was in the Nine Yin Valley, Yang Kai had seen Wen Feichen from the Blood Battle Gang perform a similar martial technique, but what he displayed was merely a vague shape of a tiger's head, not revealing the full picture.

What he had now with the Beast Soul Technique was entirely incomparable.

Whether it was the Heaven-Shaking White Tiger or the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox, Yang Kai's manifestation of the Beast Soul Technique was the complete true form of the Demonic Beasts, and their expressions were vivid and lifelike, just like real Demonic Beasts. The destructive power he could unleash was naturally many times greater than what Wen Feichen could achieve.

With these two similar Beast Soul Techniques, Yang Kai's strength had once again increased.

These two techniques could be named the White Tiger Seal and the Divine Ox Seal based on their forms.

Turning to look around, Yang Kai couldn't help but frown. From the sand covering the pit he had dug, he knew he must have been in closed-door cultivation for quite a long time.

“Earth Demon, how long has it been?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

“Over half a year, Young Master!” 

Yang Kai couldn't help but take a deep breath; no wonder he felt a bit hungry. If it hadn't been for the long duration, he wouldn't have felt this way.

However, now was not the time to seek food. Yang Kai shook off the sand on his body, sat cross-legged, and recalled the insights he had gained from absorbing the two blood beads over half a year ago.

After a long while, he smiled slightly and said, “Earth Demon, let me show you a trick!”

“What trick?” Earth Demon asked, puzzled.

Yang Kai smiled without answering, immersing himself in concentration, causing the Yang Liquid in his Dantian to explode one by one.

About half a day later, a fierce wind suddenly swept up from the ground, and Yang Kai's body trembled slightly as his aura surged dramatically.

Earth Demon was utterly astonished, for without any warning, Yang Kai had actually broken through a layer, reaching the Sixth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm.

How could this be? Half a year ago, the Young Master absorbed such a massive amount of energy but showed no signs of a breakthrough, remaining at the Fifth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm. Yet now, after just sitting quietly for half a day, how could he have broken through? He hadn't operated any techniques or absorbed any energy from the heavens and earth; in other words, the energy within him hadn't increased at all.

How did this breakthrough happen? Earth Demon found it hard to comprehend.

He wanted to ask, but Yang Kai remained in meditation, leaving him to suppress his doubts.

Half a day later, Yang Kai's aura surged once again.

Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union Realm!

Earth Demon was left speechless; Yang Kai's current breakthrough seemed too bizarre, completely beyond Earth Demon's understanding. Upon closer inspection, he finally found some clues.

The Primordial Qi within Yang Kai was vastly different from before. Although the total amount stored had not changed, both its purity and density had increased by several levels!

It was this change that led to Yang Kai's breakthrough and advancement.

This was possible? Earth Demon was shocked.

Having broken through to the Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes. The amount of Yang Liquid in his Dantian had decreased by a third. Although the quantity had diminished, the energy contained within had not changed.

This meant that now, a single drop of Yang Liquid was far more pure and potent than before. When he used the Yang Liquid to perform any techniques, the power would be greater, and the lethality would be stronger.

It was as if all the Yang Liquid in his Dantian had been reforged.

The Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union Realm was Yang Kai's current limit; he could no longer compress or purify it further.

“Young Master, this trick of yours has become remarkable; this old servant has also greatly benefited,” Earth Demon said quickly upon seeing Yang Kai open his eyes. Although it sounded a bit like flattery, Earth Demon truly admired him.

Yang Kai grinned.

Having gained a new martial technique, it was naturally time to try it out.

After searching in the valley for a while, he finally found a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast.

Using the Beast Soul Technique, the divine ox and the tiger charged at the Demonic Beast, colliding and biting, leaving the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast with no chance to fight back. Yang Kai joined in, and in just a moment, he had killed it, obtaining a blood bead.

The entire process was exceedingly easy, and Yang Kai found it hard to believe. Half a year ago, when he encountered a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, he had to weigh his options for a long time before sneaking around it. Now, he could kill it as easily as cutting grass. Even though this Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast was not particularly strong, Yang Kai still felt as if he had crossed into another world.

The blood bead he obtained was not large, but it was not small either. Compared to the blood beads condensed from the deaths of True Essence Realm experts, it was indeed not in the same league.

After storing the blood bead, Yang Kai confirmed that no one was watching him before he activated the Wings of Yang Flame and soared upward.

A cliff of ten thousand zhang; for a True Essence Realm expert to fly over it would require considerable effort, but with the Wings of Yang Flame, it was different.

In just half an hour, Yang Kai had already left the valley.

Half a day later, with a rumbling stomach, Yang Kai successfully found a fruit tree, picked many fruits, and sat under the tree to feast.

While eating the fruits, Yang Kai contemplated his next actions. He had entered this place not long before going into closed-door cultivation for over half a year, and he had no idea how the situation had developed. Moreover, from previous encounters, it seemed there were not many spiritual herbs or miraculous medicines here; all that existed were endless Demonic Beasts.

Furthermore, the Soul Cleansing Dew and Liuyan Liquid were both excellent items. If he had the chance, he needed to collect some; the Soul Cleansing Dew would be very useful to him, while the Liuyan Liquid was optional.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai did not know where to find these two items.

Just as he was deep in thought, Yang Kai suddenly paused, tilting his ear to listen.

He heard distant wolf howls and the sounds of fighting.

His heart stirred; Yang Kai quickly stuffed some fruits into his Spatial Pouch and then dashed towards the source of the sound. He needed to find someone to inquire about what had happened during his closed-door cultivation.

After a short while, Yang Kai arrived at the scene.

Hiding behind a large tree, he secretly observed the situation ahead, and upon seeing what was happening, his expression couldn't help but change.

There were two people over there, a man and a woman, fighting desperately, and these two were familiar to him.

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu from the Yingyue Sect!

Surrounding them was a group of Demonic Beasts, numbering over a dozen, and they were not of the same kind. Various types of Demonic Beasts had gathered together, with most being Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts.

If it were just this, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu would not be in such a dire situation. However, among this group of Demonic Beasts, there were also three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts.

With Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts leading the charge, even if Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu fought together, they still couldn't break free, surrounded in the center, using all their means and appearing quite disheveled.

Chen Xueshu bore numerous wounds, with a patch of crimson blood on his left leg, while Shu Xiaoyu was panting heavily, her chest rising and falling, drenched in fragrant sweat.

These two fellow disciples, both powerful True Essence Realm experts, displayed formidable martial techniques, and although they were trapped, they were not in immediate danger of being killed. However, it seemed they had been battling this group of Demonic Beasts for quite some time, and their stamina and spirit were severely depleted.

Shu Xiaoyu, being a woman, was somewhat lacking in stamina. If it weren't for Chen Xueshu's frequent rescues, she would likely have been injured long ago.
