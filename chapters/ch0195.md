## Chapter 195 — Qi Movement Ninth Layer

Yang Kai walked directly into the vein of the earth. As soon as he was enveloped by the hazy energy of heaven and earth, he felt a wave of comfort throughout his body. There was no need to circulate his cultivation technique; every pore on his body autonomously relaxed, and every inch of flesh and every cell rejoiced.

The energy of heaven and earth was rich and pure, which made Yang Kai pleasantly surprised.

He sat cross-legged and began to operate his cultivation method, akin to a whale sucking in water, absorbing the energy from the earth vein.

That year, the thief managed to cultivate to a level that gave many overseas sects headaches in just thirty years, partly due to the assistance of the Warm Spirit Lotus and partly because of this earth vein.

The former nourished the spirit, while the latter nourished the body. With both treasures at his disposal, it would indeed be strange if his strength did not increase rapidly.

Regrettably, this was merely a small earth vein, and the energy of heaven and earth it contained was not vast. After being absorbed by that thief for thirty years, the energy had already dwindled to almost nothing and was on the verge of depletion.

However, even so, it was still a great supplement for Yang Kai at this moment.

His body's uniqueness allowed him to absorb this energy even faster than that thief had back in the day. The Proud Bone Golden Body was like a bottomless pit; no matter how much energy entered his body, it could be devoured without any concern of being overwhelmed.

Moreover, the energy contained within the earth vein was pure and concentrated, requiring almost no refining. After circulating through his meridians for just one cycle, it surged into the vast reservoir of the Proud Bone Golden Body, becoming Yang Kai's storage and foundation.

As Yang Kai absorbed the energy from the earth vein, the Earth Demon consumed the thief's sea of consciousness power. The two were completely unbothered by each other, both feeling content and forgetting the passage of time.

It was not until a month and a half later that Yang Kai took a deep breath and slowly opened his eyes.

The small earth vein had been drained by Yang Kai's unrestrained absorption, and the hazy energy of heaven and earth was no longer visible.

Carefully sensing his current realm, Yang Kai's expression brightened with joy.

Unknowingly, his strength had risen to the Qi Movement Ninth Layer, just one step away from advancing to the Separation and Union Realm.

Moreover, Yang Kai could feel that the energy within him, both in quality and quantity, had already reached the level of the Separation and Union Realm; he was merely lacking that layer of comprehension regarding martial arts.

Every major realm's advancement required some personal insight. This was true when advancing to the Open Origin Realm, as well as during the Qi Movement Realm. Now, to advance to the Separation and Union Realm, he similarly needed comprehension.

However, Yang Kai had yet to touch that layer of restriction, which depended on opportunity and luck, not merely hard work.

Looking up, he saw that the Earth Demon had indeed completely absorbed the sea of consciousness power around the Warm Spirit Lotus and was now waiting for him to awaken with boredom.

Before him was the colorful Warm Spirit Lotus. Yang Kai slowly stood up and walked toward this supreme treasure that nourished the spirit.

"Is there anything particular I should know when taking it?" Yang Kai asked.

"There are no requirements. If the Young Master were a Divine Roaming Realm expert who had cultivated his divine sense, it might require a contest of wills, but since the Young Master has yet to cultivate his divine sense, you only need to take it," the Earth Demon replied.

Since there were no requirements, Yang Kai had no further concerns. He reached out his hand toward the five-colored Warm Spirit Lotus. As soon as his fingers touched the lotus flower, it vanished without a trace.

At the same time, Yang Kai suddenly felt refreshed, his mind clearer than at any other moment, and even his perception had significantly improved.

Uncontrollably, Yang Kai took a deep breath, and his whole body shivered with extreme comfort.

He could not sense the Warm Spirit Lotus's presence at all, but Yang Kai knew that it was undoubtedly in his mind at this moment. Only after cultivating his divine sense would he be able to see its trace.

"Ah, the five-colored Warm Spirit Lotus..." the Earth Demon spoke with both envy and jealousy.

"Haha," Yang Kai laughed heartily.

"Young Master, in the future, you must find some treasures that nourish the divine sense for this Warm Spirit Lotus to absorb. When it eventually transforms into a seven-colored lotus, it will be of even greater help to you."

"It can grow?" Yang Kai asked, somewhat surprised.

"Of course. When the Warm Spirit Lotus is first born, it only has one color. It also has levels; the more colors it has, the higher its level. The highest can reach seven colors. To give a direct comparison, a one-colored Warm Spirit Lotus requires a hundred years to double a person's sea of consciousness, while a five-colored Warm Spirit Lotus only needs twenty years, and a seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus only requires five years!" 

"Impressive!" Yang Kai couldn't help but marvel. Although he had yet to cultivate his divine sense, he understood the difficulty of doing so. As the Earth Demon had said before, cultivating divine sense was a hundred times more challenging than cultivating the physical body. However, with the assistance of the Warm Spirit Lotus, he need not worry; his divine sense would grow stronger and more solid.

"That being said, the five-colored Warm Spirit Lotus is quite good," Yang Kai felt no dissatisfaction. Just obtaining this treasure was already a stroke of fortune; one could not expect to acquire a seven-colored one immediately.

"It is indeed a very good treasure. If it grows into a seven-colored one in the future, it will be a supreme treasure in the world! However, this thing grows slowly and only absorbs the energy of treasures that enhance the divine sense. To turn this five-colored one into a seven-colored one, the Young Master will need to put in more effort," the Earth Demon explained.

"Let it be. I won't force it!" Yang Kai was quite open-minded. If it could become seven-colored within his lifetime, that would be his fortune; if not, there was no use in forcing it.

"As long as the Young Master has this mindset," the Earth Demon admired him. Though young, he was composed and steady. The more he interacted with Yang Kai, the more respect he felt.

If it were any other young person, with the Earth Demon’s cunning and experience, he would have easily deceived them. But facing Yang Kai, the Earth Demon dared not entertain any ill intentions, treating everything with respect.

"It’s time to leave." Yang Kai took a deep breath. Having stayed here for over a month, he had collected the Warm Spirit Lotus and absorbed the energy from the earth vein. He had already reaped all the benefits and naturally had no need to linger.

Before leaving, Yang Kai dug a pit and buried the thief's remains.

As he walked out, he hesitated for a long time when passing by the stone rack. He finally suppressed the urge to look at the treasures that stirred his heart and strode away.

On the stone rack were three treasures. Except for the Tai Yi Seal, which he could not use, Yang Kai could have taken the other two for himself. However, that thief had never used them, indicating there must be some mystery behind them.

Perhaps if he used these items, those overseas sects would sense it through some special method. This was not merely Yang Kai's speculation; it was a fact. Many major sects had placed restrictions on their treasured artifacts, and within a certain range, outsiders would be detected upon use. Yang Kai planned to return to Haicheng, so he naturally did not dare to refine these hot potatoes.

He decided to leave them here for now and retrieve them when he left Hidden Island.

After climbing several hundred zhang, Yang Kai arrived at the peak of the solitary mountain. The group of strange insects was still diligently guarding the dilapidated stone door, and the True Essence Realm experts from Yunxia showed no signs of returning, likely having been hunted down by the two giant eagles.

Letting the big insect disperse the mist at the door, Yang Kai walked out.

Standing atop the solitary peak, Yang Kai surveyed his surroundings.

This place was ten thousand li away from Haicheng. To leave Hidden Island, he could only rely on the Wings of Yang Flame. However, using the Wings of Yang Flame would consume too much Yuan Qi. After this period of turmoil, only over thirty drops of Yang Liquid remained in his Dantian, which was insufficient to support him in flying over ten thousand li.

Flying out a thousand li would be quite strenuous, and if he encountered a storm at sea, he might need to detour to avoid it, which would further increase the demand for Yang Liquid.

He needed at least four hundred drops of Yang Liquid to leave this cursed place!

Four hundred drops—were there that many Yang-attribute treasures on Hidden Island?

Yang Kai felt somewhat uncertain, but regardless, the primary task now was to search for Yang-attribute treasures to increase the Yang Liquid in his Dantian.

He instructed the strange insects to spray mist again to seal the cave and left many insects to guard the area, taking the other half down the solitary peak.

For several consecutive days, Yang Kai searched for Yang-attribute treasures and reaped considerable rewards. In just four or five days, the Yang Liquid in his Dantian had surpassed one hundred drops.

With the guidance of the Yang Source Seal on his chest, as long as he was within three hundred zhang, these treasures could not escape Yang Kai's search.

Yang Kai was not in a hurry. At this point, he was likely the only living person left on Hidden Island. Aside from those powerful demon beasts, he had subtly become the master of Hidden Island.

He explored and collected everywhere, picking all the treasures he encountered. For those with Yang attributes, he absorbed them on the spot to convert them into Yang Liquid, while those without Yang attributes were kept in his bag.

Occasionally, when he encountered some rare flowers and herbs guarded by demon beasts, he would instruct the strange insects to divert the beasts' attention while he seized the opportunity to gather them, always escaping without incident.

The map he obtained from Madam Jiang had been immensely helpful. Initially, Yang Kai was unaware of the significance of the marked locations on the map. However, after accidentally venturing into one and encountering a sixth-tier demon beast, he realized that those marked places were all perilous areas.

Since then, Yang Kai had carefully avoided these marked locations and indeed had not encountered any major troubles.

After several battles and explorations, in less than half a month, Yang Kai had completely explored Hidden Island, collecting all the treasures he could find, filling an entire large bag.

These items were all Earth-Grade and Heaven-Grade treasures, far richer than what Yang Kai had gathered on the right half of Yunxia Peninsula, at least ten times more.

He had also collected many Yang-attribute items, but even now, the Yang Liquid in his Dantian was still only around three hundred drops.

Three hundred drops of Yang Liquid—if luck was on his side, he might be able to fly to Haicheng.

But that was just a possibility; Yang Kai did not have complete confidence.

If he couldn't make it and accidentally fell into the sea, it would undoubtedly be a dead end. Even if he didn't drown, the demon beasts in the sea would be enough to take his life.

He must find more Yang-attribute items to gather enough drops, ensuring he could leave without worry.

Could it be... that he really had to pull the tiger's whiskers? After much contemplation, Yang Kai steeled his resolve!
