## Chapter 813 — Human Feelings

At the Huasheng Pool, the Great Yao Lord regarded Yang Kai with deep eyes, expression calm, and said, “Rest for a while; we’ll talk later.”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded, sitting cross-legged.

Before the Great Yao Lord, his Divine Sense still seeped into the pool’s depths as if contemplating something.

The Great Yao Lord noticed but did not stop him; he merely waved away those gathered to gawk.

Watching Yang Kai with closed eyes, the Great Yao Lord’s lips twitched—he suspected he might finally understand a secret he had long pondered.

And that secret had been unraveled by a human.

Though reluctant, there was nothing he could do.

“This brat…” the Great Yao Lord shook his head and smiled wryly; he had underestimated Yang Kai’s ability. Moreover, Yang Kai possessed Divine Sense Fire—this revelation was explosive.

Yang Kai sat for a full day and night, recovering while probing the mysteries beneath the Huasheng Pool.

Impatient, the Great Yao Lord had long since returned to Thundertree Palace.

When Yang Kai opened his eyes again, only Caidie remained at the poolside. The beautiful yao with a pair of multicolored wings regarded him curiously.

Their gazes met and Caidie’s expression grew awkward; she quickly looked away.

“Lady Caidie…” Yang Kai inclined his head and rose.

“Recovered?” Caidie asked lightly.

Yang Kai nodded. Whether imagined or not, he sensed her hostility toward him had lessened.

“If you’re recovered, come with me. The Great Yao Lord has been waiting.” Caidie fluttered her wings and led the way.

Yang Kai hurried to follow.

Along the route to Thundertree Palace, the demonic beasts and yao experts that occupied the place rose and looked at Yang Kai with friendly eyes—no longer the resistance he’d encountered before.

It seemed that by saving the white jade deer he had won their collective goodwill.

The yao truly stick together, Yang Kai thought approvingly.

In a human faction, such an act might only earn a few people’s favor; here none belittled Yang Kai—everyone treated him as an honored guest.

When they reached the Great Yao Lord’s quarters above Thundertree Palace, Caidie stopped. “Go in.”

“Thank you.” Yang Kai smiled and stepped inside.

“Hey…” Caidie suddenly called.

“What is it?” Yang Kai turned and noticed her expression was strained; her pink lips quivered as she murmured, “Thank you.”

Saying that, she spread her form and darted away, vanishing in an instant.

Yang Kai smiled dumbly, shook his head, and entered the Great Yao Lord’s chamber.

Inside, the Great Yao Lord looked at Yang Kai with a genial smile and invited, “Sit.”

Glancing toward the door, he remarked with meaning, “You’re the first human Caidie has shown favor to. Even your Saint Lord who’s visited many times never got such a reception.”

“Oh? I’m honored.” Yang Kai arched an eyebrow.

The Great Yao Lord smiled and shook his head. “But don’t blame her prejudice; there’s a reason.”

He passed over a jar of fine wine. “Drink while we talk. This wine was brought by your Saint Lord; we yao aren’t good at these things.”

Yang Kai took a sip and frowned. “Not great. Want to try something better?”

“Bring it!” the Great Yao Lord said without ceremony.

Yang Kai chuckled and retrieved a jar of wine from the Black Book Space, filling the Great Yao Lord’s cup.

The Great Yao Lord scowled. “I thought you were tolerable—now you’re stingy. Your Saint Lord brought hundreds, even thousands of jars; I drank them whole. What’s the meaning of giving this little cup?”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “This is all I have left—half a jar. I can’t be extravagant.”

The Great Yao Lord snorted and drank. Suddenly his expression shifted; delight and reminiscence washed his features, all displeasure gone. After a long while he exclaimed, “Good wine! Far better than your Saint Lord’s. Fill it up.”

He handed the cup back to Yang Kai and urged him to pour more.

Yang Kai obliged and refilled him; the Great Yao Lord drank three cups in succession and belched contentedly.

“Did you brew this?” the Great Yao Lord asked.

Yang Kai shook his head. “A wine-obsessed senior of mine brewed it. Great Yao Lord, just have a taste—don’t expect too much; this stuff takes at least fifty years to brew.”

“Fifty years…” the Great Yao Lord murmured, impressed. “Your senior is devoted to the craft—fifty years for one jar? But it’s worth it; this isn’t ordinary wine.”

Yang Kai took small sips—as he wasn’t as strong as the Great Yao Lord he couldn’t guzzle.

The Thousand Red Flower Wine brewed by Senior Fei Yu carries no small amount of power; drink too much and one might truly fall drunk.

“You mentioned Caidie—what’s her story?” Yang Kai asked with curiosity.

“Ah, her…” the Great Yao Lord thought and said, “Before she transformed, a human captured her. Her true form is a multicolored butterfly—rare and beautiful—so that human kept her. He didn’t abuse her, but she witnessed many things she hated… that captor wasn’t a good man, so she’s long held a dislike for humans.”

“I see.” Yang Kai finally understood why Caidie had been hostile.

“Old news,” the Great Yao Lord laughed. “Years ago when I was traveling I found and rescued her.”

“No need to dwell on it.”

The Great Yao Lord nodded and said no more.

Silence settled; his eyes fixed deeply on Yang Kai before he said, “About earlier—are you prepared to explain?”

“What does the Great Yao Lord wish to know?”

“What do you know?” the Great Yao Lord countered.

Yang Kai frowned. “I know the general outline.”

“How do you know? The secret beneath the Huasheng Pool eluded even me!” the Great Yao Lord’s face turned grave.

“Because it’s a natural spirit formation, and you’re not skilled in formations, are you?” Yang Kai chuckled. “You must have searched—there’s an Earth Vein beneath the hollow that channels immense energy. The Huasheng Pool is the surface manifestation of that vein, though there’s another mysterious force I haven’t identified. Regardless, it helps your yao transform.”

“Explain in detail!” the Great Yao Lord demanded.

“I won’t hide it: I’m actually an alchemist. The natural spirit formation beneath resembles the formations I use when refining; it’s composed of countless small formations merged together—tangled and complex. When your kind transform, it’s essentially like an alchemist refining a pill.”

“What’s the connection?” the Great Yao Lord sounded puzzled.

“The pool is the furnace, the Earth Vein the formation, and the water the medicinal medium—your beasts are treated like ingredients.”

“Treated like ingredients?”

“Yes. In pill-making, diverse materials converge to produce subtle miraculous changes that condense into a pill. Transformation works similarly: a beast enters, and when specific conditions are met, its flesh, blood, and bone change—upon emergence it is human-shaped.”

The Great Yao Lord frowned, murmuring as he mulled over Yang Kai’s words.

Despite his lofty power and deep cultivation, the field of alchemy left him at a loss.

After a long while he admitted helplessly, “I only understood half of what you said…”

“It’s hard to explain. If you were willing to learn alchemy, you’d grasp it thoroughly in far less than ten years,” Yang Kai smiled, “but your yao yuan isn’t suited for alchemy.”

“I don’t need to master alchemy. I merely need to understand the formation beneath the pool—if I’m right, the accidents during transformation were caused by damage to that natural formation.”

“Yes. I can clear and repair it, so I saved that white jade deer,” Yang Kai nodded and after a moment added, “When my Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s crisis is resolved, I’ll teach you the related formations—how does that sound?”

“What’s the condition?” the Great Yao Lord narrowed his eyes, wary.

“Heh… for any alchemist or artificer, the formations they command are their core secrets and aren’t shared lightly; doing so would be a great loss to me. How do you plan to compensate?”

The Great Yao Lord glared at Yang Kai in displeasure, then growled, “Fine! If you teach me those formations, consider the yao indebted to you—call on us when you need anything!”

“You’re straightforward enough—we’re friends, then.” Yang Kai smiled easily.

“You’re harder to deal with than your Saint Lord,” the Great Yao Lord snorted, then laughed and raised his cup. “Whatever—humans rarely produce one or two outstanding talents. I had hoped to be on equal footing with you in a few decades, so owing you a favor won’t hurt. You can use this favor now to ask me to help your Sacred Land.”

“No. The Sacred Land’s crisis should be resolved as we previously discussed. I’ll keep this favor for later—it’s not to be used now.”

“Suit yourself!” the Great Yao Lord shrugged and fell silent.
