## Chapter 2215 — Soul-Devouring Worms

These four were all founding heroes of the Divine Roaming Nation. In their early years, they followed Zhou Dian to unite the world, waging war across the land, rarely meeting a worthy opponent.

Even looking across the entire world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, they were renowned experts.

Yet before Zhou Dian, all of that strength was eclipsed by the brilliance of a single man.

“Split into four groups and search the mountain. You must bring those Calamity Stars back to me and present them to the King in the shortest time possible!” Zhou Dian pointed with his hand and shouted in a deep voice.

“Yes!” The four answered in unison, immediately selecting troops and dividing into four groups, quickly vanishing into the Yao Mountain.

Only Zhou Dian remained at the original spot.

The howling wind brushed past, blowing Zhou Dian’s hair. After a long while, he tapped his feet and urged the Nine-Resonance Kui Dragon Beast beneath him to move forward slowly.

The demonic beast he rode was at the Twelfth-Tier level. Even though it was only at the initial stage, it was equivalent to a cultivator at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm. Yet even so, it could only obediently let Zhou Dian ride it.

Back then, Zhou Dian had spent a great deal of effort and time to subdue this demonic beast before finally succeeding.

Staring into the depths of the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, a surge of fighting spirit flickered in Zhou Dian’s eyes, as if a rival he cared deeply about was waiting for him somewhere in those forests.

……

Yang Kai and the others, who had entered the mountain for training, naturally knew nothing of what was happening outside, because no one expected that a simple training session would stir up such a huge commotion.

At this moment, Yang Kai was facing off against a Lei Geng Azure Wolf in the Yao Mountain.

This demonic beast was only at the peak of the Tenth-Tier, about the same as the first demonic beast the group encountered after entering the Divine Roaming Mirror, but Yang Kai’s expression was grave.

The reason was that this demonic beast seemed different from the rest. It could actually control the power of lightning.

The arcs of electricity flickering across its body showed its powerful lethality, making Yang Kai quite wary.

He was now present here as a Spirit Body, not in his flesh. If he suffered any damage, he wouldn’t recover quickly. Even with the Warm Spirit Lotus on him, Yang Kai didn’t dare to come into contact with such power lightly.

Fortunately, he had no intention of acting personally.

When acting together with Xia Sheng and the others, there were many methods he couldn’t use, leaving him constrained and uncomfortable in battle.

But now that he was alone, he had no such concerns.

The Lei Geng Azure Wolf opposite him clearly sensed that Yang Kai was not to be trifled with, but wary of the difference in strength, it only kept its distance, baring its fangs and howling from time to time, trying to scare Yang Kai away.

But how could Yang Kai let it have its way...

“Come out!” Suddenly, Yang Kai shouted.

As his voice rang out, his body trembled slightly. With a flick of his sleeve, a dense swarm of black dots suddenly appeared.

At first, there weren’t many black dots. But in the blink of an eye, they became countless, rapidly gathering into a black cloud.

The black cloud was as large as a tabletop. Looking closely, it was clear that the cloud was made up of countless tiny insects, almost invisible to the naked eye.

Soul-Devouring Worms...

They should be called Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms now.

Ever since they devoured a large amount of pure Demon Yuan in Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness last time, these Soul-Devouring Worms had all turned pitch black. If magnified, each one would look hideous and terrifying, exuding a murderous aura.

As soon as the insect cloud appeared, a buzzing sound could be heard.

The Lei Geng Azure Wolf clearly didn’t know what this thing was, but its instincts told it something was wrong. Seeing the insect cloud rushing toward it, it opened its mouth, lightning flashing inside. With a crisp crack, an arc of lightning shot out, striking the insect cloud.

The insect cloud was instantly scattered...

But it quickly gathered again.

After releasing that attack, the Lei Geng Azure Wolf immediately turned to flee, not intending to linger at all.

“Chase!” Yang Kai spat out a single word. In fact, he didn’t even need to give the order; the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms’ instincts already drove them to do so.

The insect cloud clung to its target like maggots on a bone, covering the Lei Geng Azure Wolf. Though the wolf was fast, it was quickly overtaken. The insect cloud pounced, instantly enveloping the demonic beast.

Miserable howls rang out at once, the constant wailing chilling to the bone.

The insect cloud rolled and writhed like a living thing...

Yang Kai stood quietly in place, watching it all.

The Lei Geng Azure Wolf’s aura gradually weakened, neither too fast nor too slow.

“The power is still a bit lacking...” Yang Kai mused.

Although the Soul-Devouring Worms’ traits made them feared by countless living beings, Yang Kai’s worms had grown from a very low level, and over the years, he had never paid them much attention, letting them live and evolve freely on the treasure island formed by the Warm Spirit Lotus.

Although quite some time had passed and they had grown considerably, they still fell short of meeting Yang Kai’s current needs in battle.

A Tenth-Tier demonic beast was only about as strong as someone in the Void King Realm.

Outside, if Yang Kai acted, he could decide the outcome in a single move. But letting the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms attack actually took some time.

However... this Divine Roaming Mirror world was practically a paradise tailor-made for the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms. If things went well, they might undergo a complete transformation within a month.

When that time came, Yang Kai would have another trump card in his hand—one that was impossible to guard against!

So Yang Kai resolved to take advantage of this place’s uniqueness and the remaining time to properly cultivate the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms.

While he was lost in thought, the insect cloud’s rolling grew even faster, and the Lei Geng Azure Wolf’s howls faded to nothing. In the end, it stopped moving.

Yang Kai watched closely and saw that the Lei Geng Azure Wolf’s body was being rapidly devoured by the Soul-Devouring Worms...

After all, the living beings here were all Spirit Bodies, without flesh and blood—exactly the Soul-Devouring Worms’ favorite food.

If Yang Kai had killed it himself, most of the spirit energy would have dissipated, returning to this world’s space, leaving only the Divine Soul Origin behind.

But when devoured by the Soul-Devouring Worms, all the power that should have dissipated was instead absorbed by the worms, fueling their growth.

The only thing Yang Kai needed to worry about was making sure the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms didn’t consume the demonic beast’s Divine Soul Origin as well.

If that happened, he would gain nothing...

That was not what he wanted. The main goal of this training was to strengthen himself. Cultivating the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms was just a bonus—Yang Kai knew his priorities.

So after waiting a while, Yang Kai sent a message with his Divine Sense to the insect cloud.

The insect cloud was obedient, perhaps because it had spent so many years in Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, so it carried out his orders to the letter.

As soon as the message was sent, the insect cloud immediately left the Lei Geng Azure Wolf’s corpse and flew back into Yang Kai’s sleeve.

Looking over, the Lei Geng Azure Wolf had almost been completely devoured. Only a pea-sized, faint yellow orb of light remained.

Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction, stepped forward, and absorbed the orb into his body.

Soon after, he set off again.

Along the way, he didn’t encounter any particularly strong demonic beasts. Whenever the insect cloud appeared, all the demonic beasts became food for the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms. Yang Kai only needed to wait on the side for a moment to collect the Divine Soul Origin left behind.

It was almost unbelievably easy!

This was the benefit of acting alone. He didn’t need to exert much effort to gain rewards. If he were with Xia Sheng and the others, he would never have released the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms.

As time passed, Yang Kai gradually discovered something that interested him.

Even when the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms stayed in his sleeve, they seemed able to absorb the strange power of this world and grow stronger.

Thinking about it, this was only natural.

The Spiritual Qi of this world was a completely different concept from the Spiritual Qi of the outside world.

Outside, Spiritual Qi could be absorbed by a cultivator’s body, making them stronger.

But here, the Spiritual Qi could be absorbed by all living beings’ Spirit Bodies, strengthening their souls.

The Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms were no exception. The omnipresent spiritual energy was their favorite delicacy.

This was truly a treasure land! Yang Kai was elated.

He made great gains as he traveled.

In just two days, Yang Kai had used the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms to kill at least seventy or eighty demonic beasts. All their bodies were devoured by the worms, and the Divine Soul Origins left behind naturally benefited Yang Kai.

This made his Divine Sense, already comparable to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, even stronger and more solid, with a faint trend toward advancing to the Emperor Realm.

Even more obvious than Yang Kai’s gradual Divine Sense growth was the development of the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms.

At first, it took a stick of incense’s time for the Soul-Devouring Worms to finish off a Tenth-Tier Lei Geng Azure Wolf, but now, that time had been cut in half.

Their growth was even more apparent than Yang Kai’s.

Such huge gains made Yang Kai overjoyed, and he felt more and more that splitting up from Xia Sheng and the others was a wise decision.

According to Gao Xueting, absorbing the Divine Soul Origin of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast was equivalent to seven or eight days of hard cultivation, while absorbing an Eleventh-Tier one was worth about twenty days.

In just two days, the benefits Yang Kai gained were roughly equal to three or four years of cultivation.

And that was only if one used special soul-cultivating secret arts to achieve such results.

If he had stayed with Xia Sheng and the others, he would never have grown this much.

But only he could achieve this.

Because he had the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms. In every battle, he only needed to watch and then collect the spoils...

He didn’t need to exert himself at all, so he didn’t even need to rest.
