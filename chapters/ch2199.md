## Chapter 2199 — Emperor Extinction Pill

Hearing this, Xia Sheng chuckled and said, “As for the few of us… there’s no need.”

Yang Kai was taken aback. “What do you mean?”

Xia Sheng said, “Brother Yang, you want that spirit fruit, right?”

What he referred to was naturally the Calamity Fruit. Yang Kai had entered the Four Seasons Land in search of the Calamity Fruit, and this was no secret in Qingyang Shrine. Before they set out, Gao Xueting had instructed everyone that if anyone obtained the Calamity Fruit, they should keep it, as Yang Kai was looking for it and could exchange with them later.

With Gao Xueting’s instructions, and Yang Kai emphasizing before the exchange that everyone should take out their harvests from the Four Seasons Land, Xia Sheng naturally understood what he was after.

Unfortunately, from the current situation, Yang Kai had not gotten his wish.

“That’s right!” Yang Kai did not deny it and nodded slightly.

“None of us have it, so we won’t join in the fun,” Xia Sheng said with a smile. “Besides, if we really traded with you, you’d probably feel awkward refusing, and the deal would lose its meaning... En, Brother Yang, you’d better ask Wuchang if he has it.”

Of those who remained, besides Xia Sheng and the others, only Wuchang was left.

At this, Wuchang also stepped forward and looked at Yang Kai. “What spirit fruit are you looking for?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then decided to be honest. “Calamity Fruit!”

Wuchang frowned. “Never seen it.”

“Even you don’t have it...” Yang Kai couldn’t help but look disappointed. At this point, he didn’t know whether the Calamity Fruit from the Winter Domain had been picked or taken elsewhere. It seemed the main goal of this trip to the Four Seasons Land could not be achieved.

Yang Kai suddenly felt a headache coming on.

“Although I don’t have what you want, I still want to make this trade with you!” Wuchang said in a deep voice. “You can’t possibly take that Supreme Mystic Pill out with you, can you?”

“Of course not!” Yang Kai composed himself, grinned, and said, “If Brother Wuchang wants to make this trade, it’s not impossible, but... I wonder what you can offer?”

“This!” As he spoke, Wuchang directly took out a jade bottle and tossed it to Yang Kai.

He didn’t seem worried at all that Yang Kai would run off with his item. He trusted him completely, tossing over the item for the exchange first.

Seeing this, Yang Kai was momentarily stunned. He quickly dispersed the Spatial Law swirling around him, grabbed the jade bottle, and glanced suspiciously at Wuchang.

“Open it and see, you’ll know,” Wuchang said calmly.

Yang Kai uncorked the bottle and peeked inside. His expression changed slightly, and he exclaimed, “Brother Wuchang, what boldness!”

Wuchang sneered, “I’ll ascend to the Emperor Realm sooner or later. This thing is dispensable to me. But you... you’re only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, still far from ascending to the Emperor Realm. This thing is quite useful for you—it could save your life at a critical moment.”

“Brother Wuchang is right.” As Yang Kai spoke, he capped the jade bottle.

Xia Sheng and the others looked on in confusion. They had no idea what Wuchang had given Yang Kai to move him so much.

But Murong Xiaoxiao suddenly seemed to recall something and exclaimed softly, “Could it be that...?”

“What?” Xia Sheng’s gossiping spirit was ignited, and he asked Murong Xiaoxiao in a low voice.

Xiao Baiyi also looked interested, listening intently.

Murong Xiaoxiao whispered, “Emperor Extinction Pill!”

Xia Sheng sucked in a cold breath. “That bastard Wuchang actually has such a thing?” As he spoke, he looked frightened, cold sweat pouring down his forehead. “If he had used the Emperor Extinction Pill earlier, wouldn’t I be dead by now...?”

The Emperor Extinction Pill contained a full-powered strike from an Emperor Realm master. Although Xia Sheng was strong, he wasn’t confident he could withstand such a blow. He’d be dead or grievously injured.

After speaking, he suddenly looked puzzled and asked, “Wait, Xiaoxiao, how did you know that it's an Emperor Extinction Pill?”

Before Murong Xiaoxiao could answer, Xiao Baiyi interjected, “Because Xiaoxiao was right there when it appeared!”

Hearing this, Xia Sheng’s expression changed. He asked in a low voice, “So... Wuchang got the Emperor Extinction Pill in the Four Seasons Land?”

“Yes.” Murong Xiaoxiao nodded. “Didn’t I tell you before? Senior Brother Xiao and I entered the Time Temple. It was inside, at the end, that there was the Emperor Extinction Pill...”

“Were there any other treasures?” Xia Sheng asked with great interest. “What did you get?”

"I got a drop of Taiyi Divine Water...” Murong Xiaoxiao smiled. “Thanks to Junior Brother Yang. If not for him, I wouldn’t have made it out safely. As for the others... Princess Lan Xun took a Quasi-Imperial Treasure, and I think that Gong Wenshan got a share of the Imperial Aura!”

“Heaven is jealous of talent!” Xia Sheng cried out in grief, looking up at the sky. “Why couldn’t I encounter such fortune!”

Xiao Baiyi glanced at him and said, “Hmph, you were the one who insisted on exploring the Spring Domain, saying the weather was nice, the flowers were blooming, and the birds were singing!”

“Alright, I admit I was wrong.” Xia Sheng drooped his head, looking dejected, but soon perked up again. “Wait, you said Junior Brother Yang helped you get the Taiyi Divine Water. What about him... did he get anything?”

“Junior Brother Yang... seemed to get a red bead,” Murong Xiaoxiao replied. “But none of us know what it is, not even Princess Lan Xun could tell.”

"A red bead!" Xia Sheng frowned at this.

As the group chatted, Wuchang grew impatient and urged, “Are you satisfied with this?”

Yang Kai held the jade bottle containing the Emperor Extinction Pill and grinned. “Indeed, this thing is incredibly precious—a true lifesaving trump card. I’m very tempted!”

After all, it was the Emperor Extinction Pill. Although Yang Kai was strong and skilled in Spatial Law, his cultivation was still low. In the Star Realm, experts were everywhere and danger lurked at every turn. Who knew when he might face an unbeatable foe? The Emperor Extinction Pill could be his safeguard. How could he not be tempted?

This was probably one of the most valuable items in the entire Four Seasons Land—more valuable than the Imperial Aura Gong Wenshan obtained. Imperial Aura is used to refine Imperial Treasures, and Yang Kai already had several, so it was almost useless to him.

“Any other conditions?” Wuchang frowned, hearing the implication in Yang Kai’s words. “Speak, as long as it’s not too much, I can accept.”

“Brother Wuchang, you’re straightforward!” Yang Kai laughed. In fact, people like Wuchang and Luo Yuan were pleasant to work with, setting aside their personalities and tempers. Talking with them wasn’t tiring—they understood how to read people and guess their intentions.

Yang Kai said, “This thing is indeed precious, but Brother Wuchang, you know it’s just a consumable. Once used, it’s gone...”

“Enough with the nonsense. I know perfectly well the pros and cons of this thing,” Wuchang cut Yang Kai off before he could finish, shutting down any thoughts Yang Kai had of bargaining further. “Just state your terms directly!”

Yang Kai awkwardly rubbed his nose...

“Brother Yang, if you don’t mind, I have a suggestion!” At this moment, Xia Sheng suddenly chimed in mischievously.

“What trick are you up to now?” Wuchang looked at him unhappily.

Xia Sheng said innocently, “I’m just making a suggestion to Brother Yang. Whether he listens is up to him. How is that a trick?”

Yang Kai smiled. “Brother Xia, feel free to speak.”

“En.” Xia Sheng nodded, his gaze fixed on Wuchang. “Brother Wuchang, it seems you got quite a few Star Seals in the Four Seasons Land this time. Brother Yang could...”

At this, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, immediately understanding what Xia Sheng meant.

Wuchang, however, frowned.

Xia Sheng said, “Before coming here, Elder Gao said any disciple who obtained extra Star Seals could hand them in for rewards from the Sect. The more you hand in, the greater the reward. Brother Yang may not be a disciple of our Shrine, but this applies to him too. If you can get more Star Seals, you can ask the Shrine for what you want. The Hall Master and elders can help you find the Calamity Fruit!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He thought this was a good idea!

This time, he hadn’t completed his intended task in the Four Seasons Land, and couldn’t return to Fenglin City to report to Qin Chaoyang. But if he could get the Qingyang Shrine’s higher-ups involved, there might still be hope of obtaining the Calamity Fruit.

In short, Yang Kai was tempted.

“Hmph!” Wuchang snorted coldly. “What, you want to use this to reduce Tianwu Sacred Land’s slots for entering the Shattered Star Sea? Brother Xia, do you have so little confidence in your own Sect?”

“Not at all!” Xia Sheng smiled. “I’m just thinking for Brother Yang, not as you say!”

“Whatever! I don’t care if the others from Tianwu Sacred Land can enter the Shattered Star Sea. As long as I can get in, that’s enough!”

“Oh?” Xia Sheng raised an eyebrow. “So, Brother Wuchang, as long as you get one Star Seal, that’s enough?”

“That depends on him!” Wuchang looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai asked, “Let me ask first, Brother Wuchang, how many Star Seals did you get this time?”

“Five!”

“Not bad!” Yang Kai praised, then said, “Alright, since Brother Wuchang is so sincere, I’ll make this deal with you. But I have one more question.”

“Speak!” Wuchang said concisely.

“How will you give me your Star Seals?”

“Just use a secret technique to transfer them!” Wuchang replied matter-of-factly.

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “Then why did you try to chop off my arm outside the Time Temple before?”

“Do you know the secret technique?” Wuchang asked disdainfully.

“No,” Yang Kai answered honestly.

“Then it had to be chopped off!” Wuchang snorted.

“Such impeccable logic. I have no retort!” Yang Kai said with a wry expression.

“Enough talk, let’s finish the deal!”

As he spoke, he flashed to Yang Kai’s side, forming hand seals as Origin Qi surged around him.
