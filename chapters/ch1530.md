## Chapter 1530 — Close-Quarters Brawl

Just now he had handled the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird in precisely that manner.

In order to capture Yang Kai alive, Qi Tianche had put in no small amount of effort; the information he had repeatedly gathered told him that Yang Kai had many terrifying aids at his side.

Yet he had absolute confidence in the Xuan Realm Pearl.

The Xuan Realm Pearl was one of the two Imperial Treasures; if he refined it, he could grasp some of the Pearl's laws. As long as he could exclude Yang Kai's supports, a mere First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm he regarded with little concern. Once Yang Kai was captured alive, not only could he learn the secrets of Spatial Force from him, he could also drive Ye Xijun into despair and even return to the Taixuan Sect ancestral lands — accomplishing several gains at once!

From the very beginning he had not intended to fight to the death with Ye Xijun; his target had always been Yang Kai.

The vortex that had appeared once before manifested again, emitting an utterly terrifying suction, intent on swallowing the Stone Puppet!

"Delusional!" Yang Kai roared in anger, thrusting his hand into the vortex with a violent grab. Dense Spatial Force surged forth; the vortex shattered with a tremendous crash under his grasp, and the Stone Puppet, whose movement had been affected, regained its freedom.

Yang Kai laughed heartily: "Old man, your grasp of the laws of this realm seems somewhat lacking."

Qi Tianche's expression darkened, and an ominous feeling rose in him.

He had not expected Yang Kai to be able to dispel even such a method; in terms of Spatial Force mastery, even he, having refined the Xuan Realm Pearl, was no match for him.

The Stone Puppet moved like the wind, and the instant it broke free of the suction it strode forward with a kick and swung its club with brutal force.

Qi Tianche did not dare take it head-on and hurriedly dodged.

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar shaved past his body, and his flank went numb.

Before he could steady himself, a gale blew down from above and Yang Kai's explosive shout rang in his ears: "Old fossil, take one of my fists!"

"Bring it on!" Qi Tianche's face registered surprise, but more than that, joy.

He had not used his Secret Treasures, nor unleashed any secret art; he intended to face Yang Kai with his body alone — partly because the arena did not permit other means, and partly because he had confidence in his own physical constitution. Now that Yang Kai had so recklessly forced the issue, he was overjoyed.

He thought Yang Kai had grown arrogant and careless.

His dread of the Stone Giant's strength did not mean he feared a mere Yang Kai.

Without another thought, he hurled a punch to meet him.

The collision of the two fists sent a tremendous boom through the air.

Yang Kai's figure flew like an arrow loosed from a bow, hurtling backward. Qi Tianche could not help but grunt. The force drove him deep into the ground three zhang.

His face changed dramatically.

Although it was only a direct exchange of a single punch, with his experience and discernment he could plainly see Yang Kai's physical constitution was hardly inferior to his own. Both sides had taken a hit from that strike; neither had gained the upper hand.

How could this be?

He had lived for hundreds to thousands of years, and from the moment he entered the Martial Dao he had focused on tempering his body, cultivating the Body-Tempering Secret Art; today his physique exceeded that of same-ranked martial artists by many times, and even taking a direct hit from an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure would normally be no issue.

But how old was this brat, and how had he trained? How could he possess such a formidable physical constitution?

A shocking surge of Qi and blood pulsed through him, so incredible that Qi Tianche could hardly believe it.

Before his thoughts could turn, the Stone Puppet's Heaven-Shaking Pillar swept down again.

This time, Qi Tianche had nowhere to dodge—half his body was driven deep into the ground. Seeing that pitch-black staff sweeping toward his face, he drew in a deep breath, and the faint radiance blooming from his body suddenly flared brilliantly. In the next instant, it was as if an invisible layer of metal had sheathed his form, gleaming with an indescribably hard, steely luster.

He clenched both fists and raised his arms to shield his face.

The next moment, the Heaven-Shaking Pillar descended.

Boom……

Qi Tianche was hurled away by the massive force and only came to a heavy landing at the edge of this Small Xuan Realm. He tumbled to the ground pale-faced, spat a mouthful of blood, staggered to his feet, and with a grave expression looked ahead.

He had suffered a heavy loss; the Heaven-Shaking Pillar had been forged from Heaven-Crystal Darksteel, a relic from antiquity that Yang Kai had brought out from the Imperial Garden.

Heaven-Crystal Darksteel was a top-tier Void King-Grade material; a palm-sized piece could weigh ten thousand jin. If melted into a Secret Treasure during forging, it would make the treasure extraordinarily sturdy and difficult to destroy.

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar was forged entirely from this peculiar material and was unimaginably heavy.

Yang Kai could barely lift it and it was impossible for him to wield it effectively.

Only peculiar beings like the Stone Puppet could use such a strange Secret Treasure.

Brute force crushes all skill—no matter how many hundreds or thousands of years Qi Tianche had spent cultivating his body-tempering arts, he could not withstand the Heaven-Shaking Pillar’s single, violent strike.

"How did that taste?" Yang Kai shook his wrist and stood at leisure not far off; his hand still smarted somewhat from the earlier exchange of a punch with Qi Tianche.

"Not bad!" Qi Tianche forced himself to steady his spirit and slightly inclined his head. "Sect Master Yang is indeed formidable. Given time, you will surely become the brightest rising star of Dark Star and might even unite Dark Star; it's a pity you met me — you no longer have that chance."

Golden-metallic light flickered across his body as Qi Tianche, face grave, surged toward Yang Kai.

A round sun suddenly appeared overhead, unleashing dazzleingly brilliant radiance.

A Void King-Grade Secret Treasure — the Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel!

Rays of blazing light poured from the Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel, virile and scorching, as if capable of burning all things; they all surged together toward Yang Kai.

At the same time Qi Tianche unleashed the Shi he had cultivated to completion, covering the entire Small Xuan Realm.

The already cramped space suddenly grew viscous and congealed, giving the impression of sinking into a quagmire — the more one struggled, the deeper one seemed to sink.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; he knew the old man intended to fight to the death.

He could not surpass the Stone Puppet in raw strength, so he made himself the target instead.

Not daring to slacken, Yang Kai also released his own Shi.

Space abruptly warped, visible to the naked eye. Here and where it could not be seen, patches of space began to collapse, and thin rifts in the void, like cuts made by a sharp blade, eerily materialized and drifted, only to be mended by the Small Xuan Realm's laws and then reappear in a relentless cycle.

Yang Kai’s Shi was forged beneath the pressure of Imperial Might, infused with his mastery over Spatial Force. It was far more formidable than that of ordinary cultivators—once unleashed, it could even distort the surrounding space itself.

Those collapsed spots and the fine rifts that appeared were the best proof of that.

But by itself this still was not enough to contend with Qi Tianche's consummate Shi that had already approached the threshold of a Domain.

Sharp hissing sounds burst forth in rapid succession.

Over a hundred Golden Blood Threads shot forth, whirling around Yang Kai's body, continuously slicing at Qi Tianche's suppressive Shi.

The Golden Blood Threads technique itself had the effect of breaking Shi; now, with over a hundred launched at once, its effect was naturally remarkable.

With both methods applied, Yang Kai's pressure suddenly vanished, and the consummate Shi's restraint over him was instantly lifted.

Under his mental command the Golden Blood Threads danced and wound about him, intercepting every beam of the Golden Sun's radiance; none struck Yang Kai or caused him the slightest harm.

Qi Tianche was filled with astonishment!

He could not have imagined the situation would develop this far. The assets and numerous methods he took pride in had little effect against Yang Kai; the latter met every move and dissolved it all.

In an instant he grew uneasy.

But now that the arrow was nocked, it had to be loosed. Outside, Ye Xijun was still waiting for him—if he couldn’t bring down Yang Kai within this Small Xuan Realm, then even after leaving, he’d gain nothing for his trouble.

Only by capturing Yang Kai here could he regain control of the situation.

Resolute, Qi Tianche leapt at Yang Kai, fists and feet flying, carrying unstoppable force to strike him.

Yang Kai did not dodge; he countered with fists of his own, Saint Yuan erupting, his muscles trembling as he locked into a grapple with Qi Tianche.

All schemes and stratagems were meaningless at this moment—only by overpowering the other with sheer strength could one claim the final victory. The two of them were like wild brutes from the deep mountains, their fists and feet clashing in a relentless, furious brawl.

It was a collision of strength against strength: simple, direct, savage, and bloody!

The thudding crash never ceased; the deafening sounds of metal and flesh meeting issued continuously from the two, punctuated by muffled groans.

In this bout of raw bodily power, neither side had the clear upper hand.

Fang Peng stood aside, dumbfounded.

Brought into this Small Xuan Realm by Qi Tianche, he had assumed he would join forces with Qi Tianche and easily take down Yang Kai. He believed Qi Tianche planned likewise, yet now he was dismayed to find he could not intervene in such a fight — he was forced to stand and watch, secretly anxious.

Even the tiny Stone Puppet waited at the side, not rashly attacking.

It too could not intervene!

Bang bang bang……

Qi Tianche's prideful physique was hammered by Yang Kai's relentless punches, each blow ringing loudly; a body whose strength could rival an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure still could not withstand the opponent's tremendous force. The savage barrage shook his flesh, assaulted his meridians and bones, and left him faintly on the verge of collapse.

Though not grievously wounded, Qi Tianche bled from mouth and nose, looking hideous.

Yang Kai was the same, yet the blood he shed was golden, filled with tremendous self-healing and restorative power; the Qi and blood contained within that Golden Blood was terrifying.

The ferocious combat seemed to awaken something savage in Yang Kai's heart; his eyes grew cruel and bloodthirsty, the whites reddening, his expression fierce — like a beast let loose from its cage, eager to rend and devour.

Time ticked away.

The two were smattered with blood, flesh cracked in great patches, but Yang Kai's punches never weakened; instead they grew heavier, and each strike sent Qi Tianche's body reeling.

Qi Tianche's momentum was gradually waning.

The stronger and weaker had been decided!

Perhaps in pure bodily tempering and strength the two were evenly matched, but Yang Kai possessed an advantage Qi Tianche did not — the Golden Blood!

The injuries Yang Kai sustained could recover in a very short time, while Qi Tianche's could not; as one waned and the other waxed, Qi Tianche naturally fell into the inferior position.
