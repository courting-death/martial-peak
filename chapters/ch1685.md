## Chapter 1685 — Massacre

Being mocked by Yang Kai, Ren Tianrui opened his mouth to argue, but Yan Pei raised a hand to stop him: "No need to say anything; this matter was our fault from the start. Sect Master Yang, rest assured, I will lead the people of Jubao Tower away from Lingxiao Sect!"

Yang Kai gave him a deep look but said nothing more. Turning to Old Woman Feng and the others, he chuckled lightly, “Very good, very good. Great Elder Ye is kind and righteous, yet who would’ve thought her mercy would save a pack of ungrateful wolves? You’ve done well!”

The Origin Returning Realm warriors opposite all wore faces of guilt and shame, looking utterly embarrassed.

It was indeed a disgraceful matter; those present were senior figures from the major forces, top‑tier combatants. Although most were sly as foxes and ruthless as wolves, doing something like this made them sink deep into shame.

So faced with Yang Kai's contempt, none of them could find words to retort.

And they feared rousing Yang Kai's wrath and triggering a slaughter, so each of them fell silent.

The old black‑faced Yan Pei stood to one side, feeling the murderous intent coming from Yang Kai as if it were tangible; his expression grew extremely grave. He opened his mouth several times, then sighed deeply and maintained his silence.

"Who led this!" Yang Kai shouted fiercely, his gaze like lightning as it swept over the crowd.

Feeling that terrifying aura, everyone involuntarily stepped back a few paces, and in the next moment most of their eyes focused on Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain.

Old Woman Feng's face changed drastically, and she glanced at Yang Kai with obvious apprehension.

Yang Kai cracked a feral grin.

Old Woman Feng no longer dared linger; she let out a long howl. Her withered body suddenly exploded with a powerful aura and transformed into a streak of light that shot outward.

“Trying to run? Leave your life behind first!” Yang Kai barked coldly, reaching out and clawing fiercely toward Old Woman Feng from afar.

A hundred zhang away, Old Woman Feng suddenly felt the surrounding space harden; visible spatial rifts formed and wrapped around her, slicing toward her like the sharpest blades.

“Sect Master Yang, let’s talk this out! This old woman admits her mistake—I’m willing to offer compensation!” Old Woman Feng cried out loudly, utterly lacking the courage to resist that strange power. All she could do was circulate her Saint Yuan desperately to withstand the devouring and rending force of the surrounding space cracks.

"Too late!" Yang Kai remained unmoved as spatial force erupted again.

In the void, those spatial rifts hummed in unison, as if they had truly become swords, slashing through Old Woman Feng's body.

The next instant, this Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert from Myriad Beasts Mountain lost all breath; her body was shredded and tattered. Most of her bones were banished into the endless void. She plummeted from the sky and smashed into a conspicuous puddle of blood and meat.

Yang Kai's gaze swept to the other people of Myriad Beasts Mountain.

The senior figures from Myriad Beasts Mountain who had come with Old Woman Feng went deathly pale, their reactions varied.

Some fell to their knees, wailing and begging for mercy. Some, like Old Woman Feng, made a snap decision and tried to flee. Others realized they could not escape and stood in place with ashen faces, circulating Saint Yuan and ready to fight back at any moment.

Feng Yan stood stunned, her exquisite features filled with shock, as if she still could not process what had happened.

Yang Xiuzhu and the other two surged out again; this time no order from Yang Kai was needed — they already knew what to do.

After ten breaths, the senior ranks of Myriad Beasts Mountain were annihilated, leaving only the stunned Feng Yan standing.

The surrounding bloodshed and the brutal deaths of many Senior Aunts and Uncles finally sobered Feng Yan considerably. Her delicate body trembled, her mind in turmoil, and she did the unthinkable — she charged straight at Yang Kai, shouting, "I'll fight you to the death!"

Yang Kai watched her without expression, showing no intention of stopping or intervening.

Lin Yurao, standing behind him, stepped forward. With a graceful flick of her hand a streak of light slid from her fingertip. Feng Yan's beautiful eyes widened; when she was five zhang from Yang Kai she suddenly fell forward, and crimson blood welled from her long, pale neck.

With that, Myriad Beasts Mountain was truly wiped clean — not a soul left alive. That sect was completely erased from Dark Star.

From the crowd came a panicked shout, "You cannot kill me! I am the top alchemist of Dark Star and have made great contributions to the human race; you cannot kill me!"

Yang Kai turned toward the voice and discovered the speaker was Great Elder Li Jianming of the Medicine Pill Sect.

His face drained of blood; having witnessed Yang Kai's bloody methods, he was on the verge of collapse.

"It seems your Medicine Pill Sect had a hand in this?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and, with a faint movement, arrived before Li Jianming, extending a hand toward him.

Although Li Jianming was a Great Elder of the Medicine Pill Sect, he was only a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Years of alchemy had left him little energy to cultivate the Martial Dao, so his combat strength was low and his experience in battle limited.

Yang Kai advanced with a palm; Li Jianming did not even attempt to dodge, babbling and shouting, "You cannot kill me!"

Yang Kai paid him no heed and smashed his head to pieces with a single palm.

"Stop!" A belated shout rang out, but it only reached Yang Kai after Li Jianming's skull had been crushed.

Turning, Yang Kai saw several other senior figures of the Medicine Pill Sect glaring at him angrily.

As his gaze met theirs, the Medicine Pill Sect's elders felt as if plunged into an ice cellar, their bodies chilled through.

At their head was another elder of the Medicine Pill Sect — the one who had shouted earlier. When Yang Kai looked his way, his teeth chattered and he trembled, "Sect Master Yang... we are willing to submit to Lingxiao Sect; we beg Sect Master Yang to spare our lives."

At these words, everyone present was moved.

The Medicine Pill Sect, though small in number, had always been extremely aloof.

In the days when the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect were at their peak, they had once contemplated seizing the Medicine Pill Sect and making its alchemists work for them, but the Medicine Pill Sect never yielded, so even the jealous Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect had been powerless.

Every year they could only cooperate with the Medicine Pill Sect, supplying vast amounts of materials for the sect to refine into pills.

None expected that today the Medicine Pill Sect's elders would voluntarily bow to Lingxiao Sect.

Although Great Elder Li Jianming was dead, the Medicine Pill Sect still had four Origin‑Grade Lower‑Level alchemists and more than a dozen Saint King‑Grade alchemists — a force to incite intense envy.

Any power that could seize such resources would see its overall strength significantly boosted for a long time to come.

Despite the chilling atmosphere in the square and Yang Kai's prior methods, when that elder of the Medicine Pill Sect spoke, others couldn't help but look at Yang Kai with some envy.

"We are willing to submit — please spare us, Sect Master Yang!" The other elders, seeing the situation lost, lowered their once proud heads and declared their submission.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others raised their brows, looking somewhat pleased as they glanced at Yang Kai, apparently hoping he would accept the Medicine Pill Sect's plea.

Yang Kai gave a wry smile. "I killed Li Jianming — do you not hate me for that?"

The faces of the Medicine Pill Sect's elders flickered. The elder who had spoken earlier replied, "A fine bird chooses its tree; we have only made the best choice."

"Heh!" Yang Kai chuckled lightly, then his expression hardened. With a wave of his hand he said, "Kill them!"

The Medicine Pill Sect members froze, and even Yang Xiuzhu and the others were stunned — none had expected Yang Kai to issue such a cold, merciless command.

Yet they did not hesitate; after a brief daze they leapt forward.

The elder of the Medicine Pill Sect called out, "Sect Master Yang, the four of us are all of Origin‑Grade alchemist caliber, you..."

Before he could finish, Chu Hanyi ended him with a palm.

The people of the Medicine Pill Sect had little combat ability, and Yang Xiuzhu and the other two barely had to lift a hand before sending them off to report to the King of Hell.

Still, there was a tinge of regret on everyone's faces.

Those they had slain were all Alchemists—masters capable of refining Spiritual Pills above the Saint King Grade, the kind of people no power could easily recruit in the past. Yet now, their bodies lay strewn across the Lingxiao Sect’s square, turning cold one by one.

Yang Kai felt indifferent. Others might have spared those lives, since Origin‑Grade alchemists are not easy to find, especially on a world like Dark Star.

Every alchemist above Saint King‑Grade was truly precious.

But Yang Kai himself was a Void King‑Grade alchemist; his Little Senior Sister's alchemical skill was at least as good as his. Why worry about a handful of Origin‑Grade Lower‑Level alchemists?

Giving them precious herbs to refine made Yang Kai uneasy; killing them solved the problem and prevented them from wasting the materials.

Having dealt with the two chief culprits, Myriad Beasts Mountain and the Medicine Pill Sect, Yang Kai's fury and murderous intent finally eased. Under the shocked, anxious gazes of all, he exhaled and declared, "You now have two choices: submit or die!"

These people were all of the Origin Returning Realm — a considerable force.

Yang Kai certainly had the ability to kill them all, but he preferred to recruit them.

The Corpse Spirit Sect was currently wreaking havoc on Dark Star, and Lingxiao Sect had suffered heavy casualties among its original experts. They were short of powerful hands.

The people before him were the best candidates.

As the old black‑faced Ren Tianrui had said, many forces had not participated in forcing Ye Xijun and the others; some were merely swept along, deceived by others.

Thus, after executing the principal offenders, Yang Kai did not intend to probe further. The blood of Myriad Beasts Mountain and the Medicine Pill Sect should be enough to sober these people.

With those words, the square fell silent.

People exchanged glances; compared with their earlier alarm, their expressions finally eased somewhat.

They truly feared Yang Kai's sudden resolve to wipe them out. Given the means he had just used and the strength of Yang Xiuzhu and the other two, no one could resist.

No one was foolish enough to question Yang Kai's tyrannical decree. Compared to his thunderous methods moments ago, being offered a choice now felt like a great mercy — many felt a complex relief as if just granted amnesty.
