## Chapter 2303 — No Loyalty

“My Young Master invites Young Brother over for a discussion. There is an important matter to talk about.” The old man surnamed Li suppressed his displeasure and spoke in a deep voice.

“Not going!” Yang Kai didn’t even think about it and refused outright.

As soon as he spoke, everyone was shocked.

The surrounding martial artists, who had been watching the commotion with curiosity, widened their eyes in astonishment, staring at Yang Kai. They wondered what kind of person he was from Thousand Leaves Sect to have such an imposing manner, daring to refuse Qiu Yu’s invitation so directly. The previously noisy inner hall suddenly fell silent for a moment.

The old man surnamed Li also hadn’t expected Yang Kai to refuse so bluntly. His old face instantly darkened as he said in a deep voice, “Young Brother, you look young, but your hearing seems poor. Let this old man repeat himself…”

Yang Kai grinned and interrupted, “You can say it a hundred times, I still won’t go. Can’t you see I’m busy?”

As he spoke, he picked up another spirit fruit and stuffed it into his mouth.

The old man’s face sank further. “Young Brother, you’d best think carefully before answering.”

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, his tone wild and unruly. “Oh? Are you threatening me? This is the City Lord’s grand concubine selection ceremony—do you really dare to cause trouble here? Believe it or not, I’ll report you to the City Lord and have you thrown out!”

He shouted this loudly, drawing the attention of even more distant guests, who looked over curiously.

Cold sweat immediately broke out on the old man’s forehead. He was both embarrassed and angry. Although he wasn’t particularly afraid of Luo Jin, if he did anything to force others or bully the weak in front of so many people, it would surely damage Tianzhao Palace’s reputation and honor.

Yang Kai kept chewing on the spirit fruit and spoke indistinctly with his mouth full, “First Brother, you’re not exactly young anymore, yet you still go around making people angry. Have you lived your whole life like a dog or what?”

“Pfft…” Ye Qinghan, who had just picked up her cup to hide her delight, directly spat out a mouthful of water upon hearing this.

“You…” The old man surnamed Li was furious.

Yang Kai snorted, “Stop with the ‘you this, you that.’ If Qiu Yu wants to talk to me, let him come himself. Make it clear—it’s him looking for me, not the other way around!”

After saying this, he muttered in disgust, “Truly sick, I don’t know where this sense of superiority comes from!” Then he continued to battle the fruit plate in front of him.

“You’re quite something, boy. I’ll remember you!” The old man was truly infuriated. With a flick of his sleeve, he left in anger. He was, after all, a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, highly regarded by the Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace, yet today he was publicly humiliated and scolded by a youth. If not for his concerns and not wanting to make a scene, he would have already taught Yang Kai a lesson.

But today’s humiliation—he naturally kept it in mind. Once the concubine selection ceremony was over, he would make Yang Kai pay.

After the old man left, Wuma immediately looked at Yang Kai with shining eyes, exclaiming excitedly, “Brother Yang, I like you so much!”

Yang Kai shuddered all over, his face turning a bit pale as he looked at Wuma and blurted, “I’m only interested in women!”

Wuma’s face instantly filled with embarrassment. “Brother Yang, that’s not what I meant. I just wanted to say… what you did just now was so satisfying!”

Ever since entering the city yesterday, Wuma had been holding in a bellyful of anger, but what had just happened made him feel delighted. As a disciple of Thousand Leaves Sect, he had many concerns and couldn’t act as freely as Yang Kai, who did whatever he pleased without worry.

Du Xian also looked satisfied, but he was a bit worried. After all, Yang Kai had publicly humiliated the old man, and who knew if Tianzhao Palace would let it go. Moreover, now that Tianzhao Palace and Tianhe City were in cahoots, if anything happened to them on the way back to Thousand Leaves Sect, it would be a big problem.

While he was worrying, he suddenly felt a soft hand grasp his large one. Du Xian looked up to see Ye Qinghan gazing at him with a smile in her beautiful eyes, whispering, “Senior Brother, don’t worry. Young Master Yang… has his own reasons for acting as he does.”

Du Xian was moved. Although he didn’t know why Ye Qinghan had such confidence in Yang Kai, he was affected by it and nodded slightly, feeling relieved.

Meanwhile, the old man returned to Qiu Yu’s side and whispered in his ear for a while.

Qiu Yu looked in Yang Kai’s direction, frowned, pondered for a moment, and then slowly stood up.

He actually started walking over.

The Thousand Leaves Sect members all changed expressions, as if facing a great enemy. Only Yang Kai kept chewing on his spirit fruit, making crisp sounds.

A moment later, Qiu Yu brought the two old men to the Thousand Leaves Sect’s table.

Du Xian immediately stood up and said in a low voice, “Brother Qiu, this is the City Lord’s concubine selection venue, and the ceremony is about to begin. You’re not planning to upset the City Lord, are you?”

Qiu Yu looked at him and said, “Don’t worry, I’m not here to cause trouble. I just want to say a few words to Brother Yang!”

“Just a few words?” Du Xian frowned, unable to understand why Qiu Yu would come here personally just to talk to Yang Kai. From what he’d seen yesterday, the two didn’t even know each other, so what grudge could there be between them?

Qiu Yu patted Du Xian’s shoulder, motioning for him to sit down, then walked over to Yang Kai and signaled to the Thousand Leaves Sect disciple sitting beside him.

The Thousand Leaves Sect disciple frowned but still gave up his seat.

Qiu Yu clapped his folding fan shut, put it away, and sat down next to Yang Kai. “Brother Yang, is it?”

Without even raising his head, Yang Kai said, “Brother Qiu, your brow is dark and your eyes lack focus; lips cracked, tongue parched, spirit in disarray, with a faint flush upon the face. I fear a blood calamity is close at hand.”

Qiu Yu was stunned, then sneered, “Brother Yang, are you skilled at reading faces and divination?”

Yang Kai glanced at him sideways. “Not skilled, but there’s a deathly aura lingering around you. Today will surely be unlucky.”

“Nonsense.” Qiu Yu snorted. “Today is the City Lord’s concubine selection ceremony, a day full of joy. How could there be any sign of misfortune?”

“Believe it or not.” Yang Kai shrugged.

Qiu Yu frowned. “Then, in your opinion, how should it be resolved?”

“Pack up and get out of here as soon as possible.” Yang Kai replied casually, then looked at him disdainfully. “Such a simple thing, and you need me to teach you?”

Qiu Yu was speechless, rubbing his forehead. “Enough joking. I came here to ask you a question.”

“What is it?”

Qiu Yu moved his lips, but no sound came out. Clearly, he was using a secret voice transmission technique.

This made Du Xian, Ye Qinghan, and the others curious. They wondered what Qiu Yu was asking Yang Kai.

Observing closely, after Yang Kai finished listening, a strange smile appeared on his face. He said, “She didn’t go back? Brother Qiu, you’re in big trouble now!”

“Will it kill you to keep your voice down?” Qiu Yu glared at Yang Kai through gritted teeth.

Yang Kai nodded. “Fine.”

Then he also used a secret voice transmission, “That girl named Luo Bing didn’t return after going out with you yesterday? Are you sure?”

Qiu Yu nodded. “I went to look for her last night, but her personal maid said she hadn’t come back. I went again today, and she’s still nowhere to be found…”

Yang Kai smiled. “The City Lord doesn’t know about this, does he?”

Qiu Yu replied, “How could the City Lord know? He has fourteen concubines but no heirs, only this one daughter, whom he treasures dearly. If he found out Luo Bing was missing, Tianhe City would be turned upside down. We wouldn’t be able to sit here so calmly.”

“She’s missing, so shouldn’t you be looking for her? Why ask me?” Yang Kai looked puzzled.

“Because right after you left that shop yesterday, Luo Bing followed you out.” Qiu Yu answered.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. “Brother Qiu, are you implying I abducted Miss Luo Bing?”

“It’s best if you didn’t. I just hope she returns safely today. If so, all will be forgiven. But if she’s harmed in any way, I’ll make whoever hurt her suffer every torture known to man.” Qiu Yu’s eyes were icy as he spoke.

Yang Kai sneered, “Brother Qiu, you’re threatening the wrong person. After I left that shop yesterday, I went straight back to Heaven Puppet Tower and never saw Miss Luo Bing. You can confirm this with the people at Heaven Puppet Tower or ask the Thousand Leaves Sect members. Besides, I just arrived in Tianhe City and have no grudges here. Why would I trouble Miss Luo Bing?”

“Really?” Qiu Yu’s gaze sharpened.

Yang Kai snorted, “If anyone offends me, I’ll deal with them myself. I wouldn’t stoop to abducting someone’s daughter.”

Qiu Yu’s expression shifted. “Alright, I believe you. Although we haven’t met many times, I know you’re straightforward. You shouldn’t be that despicable. But if you hear anything about Luo Bing, please let me know. I’d be very grateful.”

“No problem.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“Farewell!” Qiu Yu cupped his fists and was about to get up.

But Yang Kai pressed him back into his seat.

“Is there something else, Brother Yang?” Qiu Yu frowned.

“It’s nothing much, just a small favor.” Yang Kai grinned wickedly, his smile full of mischief, making Qiu Yu uneasy.

“What favor…” Qiu Yu asked in a low voice.

Yang Kai said, “Could Brother Qiu help us change seats?”

Qiu Yu was puzzled. “Change seats?”

“That’s right!” Yang Kai nodded and smiled. “The lighting here isn’t great. I don’t like it. I want to move somewhere brighter.”

Qiu Yu’s mouth twitched, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. He wiped it and asked, “So… where do you want to move?”

Yang Kai pointed. “I think that table over there is pretty good, and it just happens to be empty.”

Qiu Yu’s face darkened. “Do you know who usually sits there?”

Yang Kai chuckled, “As long as it’s a seat for people, what does it matter?”

“No, no, absolutely not.” Qiu Yu waved his hands repeatedly.

Yang Kai’s face turned cold. “Brother Qiu, you’re really not being loyal. I agreed to your request so readily, but when it’s my turn to ask a small favor, you keep making excuses. That’s not loyal at all!”

Qiu Yu’s eyes widened. He thought, what loyalty do I have with you? Besides, you only agreed to my request casually, without any sincerity. Where’s the loyalty in that?
