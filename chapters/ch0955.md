## Chapter 955 — Star Shuttle

The starry sky spread boundlessly, its pressure terrifying; without sufficient physical strength, anyone who entered would certainly die. At least one had to possess cultivation at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm to use Saint Yuan to resist the starry sky's crushing might.

This was a legendary place—few had ever truly set foot here.

That legendary Great Demon God of the era was even rumored to have fallen while probing the mysteries of the starry sky.

Whether the rumor was true or not, it was certain that the starry sky harbored immense danger.

If those from the Ice Sect thought this was merely the entrance to an ordinary Void Passage leading to some Small Xuan Realm and rushed in, they would likely meet a grim fate.

Apart from the Ice Lord Qing Ya, who had the strength to withstand the starry sky’s pressure, none of them stood any chance.

Yang Kai's mind was in turmoil; he stood there like an idiot, not knowing what to do.

He only snapped back when the corner of his eye caught a few pale bones floating nearby.

Those bones drifted not far from him, utterly motionless. Yang Kai's big hand trembled as he picked one up, examined it carefully, and let out a long breath.

Those bones should belong to members of the Bone Clan who had recklessly plunged into the starry sky, unable to bear the enormous pressure and having their bodies crushed to pieces.

This made Yang Kai even more convinced of his earlier suspicion.

The Ice Sect people must have truly escaped here, and Bone Clan members, pursuing them, had accidentally come here and been crushed to death by the starry sky’s pressure.

There were many bones around—clearly several Bone Clan had died.

But if that were the case, what about the Ice Sect members and Su Yan?

There were no traces of them being harmed here; they seemed to have vanished from the starry sky as if by some miracle.

Gradually calming, Yang Kai crushed the bone in his hand, summoned his Flying Shuttle, and began to search the vast starry sky for any clue.

He searched every corner, leaving no suspicious spot unscanned, unleashing his divine sense to the utmost, hoping to suddenly find Su Yan’s trail—perhaps she was sheltering safely somewhere in the starry sky under the Ice Lord Qing Ya’s protection, waiting for him.

He was bitterly disappointed.

Centering on the starry sky's gate for ten thousand li in every direction, he searched repeatedly but could not find a single clue.

Days passed without him knowing how many. When he returned to the Void Passage he'd come through, he turned back to stare long and hard at the sparkling starry sky, then plunged into the entrance.

Returning to the Tongxuan Continent, he headed straight for the Water Divine Hall.

If anyone still knew the whereabouts of those Ice Sect people besides the Bone Clan, it would be the Water Divine Hall; for Su Yan’s sake he had to find out.

The Water Divine Hall's central island—this had originally been the island housing the Hall’s main sanctuary, but after the Water Divine Hall was annihilated, it had been occupied by the Bone Clan.

At this moment, all the Bone Clan had gathered here.

Each member possessed a whole flesh-and-blood body now, no longer merely skeletons without a shred of flesh.

They looked no different from the continent’s humans; the only sign of their identity was those pairs of jade-green eyes.

Nearly two hundred Bone Clan gathered together, their eyes flickering like ghost-fire, emitting an eerie emerald glow that made the whole island feel chilling and dreadful.

They reveled and celebrated exuberantly, rejoicing in their revival after thousands of years, every Bone Clan member’s face alight with elation.

Their clamor carried far on the sea breeze.

They formed a ring, and at the center of the Bone Clan stood an enormous blood pool filled with crimson water and chunks of flesh. Huge bubbles constantly rose and burst, splashing blood mist about until a scarlet cloud condensed above the pool.

Many pale bones and unidentified medicinal ingredients bobbed and sank in the blood pool.

Bright streaks occasionally flashed along the pool’s bottom, converging into a complex and intricate array.

"Lord Kelo, the time is nearly right," a Bone Clan member walked up to a middle-aged man and reported softly.

The middle-aged man nodded faintly, his expression indifferent, then rose to his full height.

The noisy Bone Clan fell silent in an instant; each pair of eyes looked at him with eager expectation.

Kelo cast his gaze around, then declared loudly, “Thousands of years ago, our clan came here by chance, thinking to expand our territory. We did not expect to be blocked by an outstanding master here. Our clan suffered a crushing defeat; our experts all perished in battle, and the rest were forced to flee to a remote Glacier World and fall into a deep slumber. Now we have awakened! That master who could not be defeated by our strongest is long dead—this world belongs to our clan now! No one can stand against us!”

The Bone Clan cheered, their voices surging in wave after wave.

Kelo raised his hand to quiet them. “Tonight new clan members will be born again. We must each contribute our strength to help them awaken!”

Many Bone Clan members pledged in response.

In the next moment everyone moved; streams of energy imbued with Bone Clan life essence shot from their bodies into the blood pool.

The blood pool boiled and churned; the bones and ingredients bobbed more violently.

Amid howls like ghosts and wolves, many blurry human faces rose from the pool—faces bound within the blood as if they were spirits, struggling but unable to break free from the watery grasp.

Every Bone Clan member watched the pool with excited expressions, their eyes full of expectation.

The floating bones suddenly all sank, and with cracking sounds, countless bones fused and intertwined within the pool, as if a world-shaking transformation was underway.

Then, with a splash, a complete skeleton rose from the blood. Two jade-green lights flared up in its formerly black eye sockets.

Those two green lights, however, were weak compared with the other Bone Clan members’—like a candle flame in the wind, they could be snuffed out at any moment.

The newly risen one looked bewildered, still unclear about his situation.

Yet instinct compelled him to draw in the blood-and-flesh essence from the pool.

Flesh visibly grew on his bones, and before long skin formed.

He looked like a shriveled old man.

More skeletons rose behind him, at least a hundred in number, and as they absorbed, the blood pool’s water rapidly diminished. In less than half an hour the pool was drained dry.

Only many medicinal ingredients and a number of bones remained at the bottom, now useless.

Kelo only then slightly inclined his head, appearing satisfied and about to issue orders, when a cold, indifferent voice suddenly rang from the night sky: “So this is how you are born!”

Kelo's eyes flashed with divine light as he turned to look.

A streak of golden light swept in from that direction, carrying destructive power enough to raze the heavens.

Kelo's expression changed drastically; he hurriedly mobilized his internal strength to resist the golden strike, but it was too late.

With a thunderous crash the blood pool was shattered to pieces. Those Bone Clan who had just been born in the pool could not withstand the attack—their bones shattered and flew apart, collapsing utterly with no survivors.

Bone Clan members born by this method were extremely fragile at first.

“Who dares!” Kelo snarled, his face stormy.

Yang Kai, wrapped in a chill, stood in the void and strode to a position above the gathered Bone Clan, looking down at Kelo from on high with unafraid composure.

He could feel that among the Bone Clan here this man held the greatest strength and authority.

If he wanted answers, questioning this man was the best choice.

Beams of hostile gazes shot toward Yang Kai; divine senses locked onto him and the Bone Clan's faces all turned grim.

From the crowd, a Bone Clan member scrutinized Yang Kai and then cried out, “It’s you!”

“Lord, he’s the one who has the Star Shuttle!” he hurriedly reported to Kelo.

Kelo’s expression brightened and he laughed loudly. “No wonder you were so brazen despite your low strength—relying on the Star Shuttle’s might. But you’ve picked the wrong opponent; the Star Shuttle means nothing before me.”

As he spoke, the world’s aura suddenly stilled, and an invisible binding seemed to press upon Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned and took a careful measure, but sensed nothing obvious; he remained cautiously alert.

“Human, hand over the Star Shuttle and I will graciously allow you to join our clan!” Kelo said carelessly, reaching a hand toward Yang Kai.

“The Star Shuttle?” Yang Kai frowned, then, as if recalling something, took out his Flying Shuttle and said, “Do you mean this?”

“Indeed!” Kelo’s eyes fixed on the Flying Shuttle. “Give it to me!”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “You call it a Star Shuttle—do you know what this Secret Treasure truly is?”

A sneer crossed Kelo’s eyes, and the others laughed as if mocking Yang Kai’s ignorance.

“Who hasn’t seen a Star Shuttle? In the starry void they’re common Secret Treasures!” someone in the lower ranks shouted.

“Starry void?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

Kelo grew impatient. “A starry void is a starry void! Your world is too remote—you don’t even know of the starry void or Star Shuttles.”

“This Secret Treasure is good for travel and nothing else. Why do you want it?” Yang Kai asked.

“Hmph. Without a Star Shuttle, how can one traverse the starry sky? The vast starry void will confuse and mislead anyone within it; they will wander and die alone!”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted; although Kelo had not fully explained, he gleaned something unusual from the words.

This Star Shuttle was evidently specialized for traveling through the starry sky—no wonder it moved so fast.

More importantly, he had gleaned an even more terrifying piece of information.

Looking gravely at Kelo, Yang Kai asked in a low voice, “Aren’t you of the Tongxuan Continent?”

Kelo laughed, “When did I ever say that?”
