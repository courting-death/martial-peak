## Chapter 2538 — Thunder Tide

Hearing Old Ban's question, Zhang Ruoxi trembled as she replied, "I don't know if this is a Yin-Soul, but it doesn't have a physical form... and it seems really angry right now!"

"When it gets close, attack it with your Divine Soul. Ordinary attacks are useless against them. Don't be afraid, Miss. With your cultivation, ordinary Yin-Souls can't harm you, unless it's those high-level Ghost Generals or Ghost Commanders. You must remain calm!" Old Ban reminded her urgently. He seemed to have experienced many such situations and had his own methods for dealing with them.

Upon hearing this, Zhang Ruoxi took a deep breath, her Divine Sense constantly probing her surroundings, keeping a close watch on the Yin-Soul's movements.

After being attacked, the Yin-Soul indeed seemed extremely enraged. Its indistinct facial features twisted into a ferocious grimace, and its translucent body retreated a step into the strange mist before whipping up a gust of gloomy wind, baring its fangs and claws as it lunged at Zhang Ruoxi.

Before the attack even landed, its piercing, shrill screech rang out. The sound was not only grating but also carried a strange Divine Soul power, trying to tear through the defenses of Zhang Ruoxi's Sea of Consciousness.

Thanks to Old Ban's reminder, Zhang Ruoxi guarded her mind carefully. Though her face was a bit pale, she didn't make a sound. When the Yin-Soul was just three inches from her, she suddenly erupted with pure Divine Sense power.

The Yin-Soul's translucent body was like a droplet of water crashing into an unbreakable wall—it instantly shattered into pieces, dissipating into smoke with a mournful wail.

"Whew..." Zhang Ruoxi let out a light breath, slowly calming herself down.

After personally destroying a Yin-Soul, she realized this strange thing wasn't so terrifying after all, so she wasn't as afraid anymore.

Old Ban spoke from ahead, "These little Yin-Soul ghosts here are so weak that even someone like me can deal with them easily. So as long as you don't panic, Miss, you'll be fine. But you must be careful—some Yin-Souls in this strange environment have cultivated special Divine Soul techniques. All of these are Divine Soul attacks and are truly hard to guard against. If you have a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, Miss, you should activate it now, just in case."

He didn't bother reminding Yang Kai about these things, because he knew that an expert of the Emperor Realm didn't need much advice from him.

Zhang Ruoxi stuck out her tongue and said, "I don't have a Divine Soul Secret Treasure."

All she had on her was just two Secret Treasures: one was the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress given to her by the Divine Spirit Qiong Qi, and the other was the Myriad Beasts Seal that Yang Kai had entrusted to her.

Hearing this, Old Ban said nothing more and focused on leading the way ahead.

As they traveled, Yin-Soul ghosts would occasionally come to harass them, but because Old Ban was so familiar with this passage, the route he chose was extremely safe. They didn't encounter any powerful ghosts, and those Yin-Souls that tried to bother the three of them naturally met a bad end.

Yang Kai never made a move; all the Yin-Souls were left for Zhang Ruoxi to handle.

After half an hour, Zhang Ruoxi had become completely accustomed to it. She was no longer nervous as at the start, and when Yin-Souls attacked, she could kill them without changing her expression.

Although the strange mist made it impossible for Yang Kai to determine their position or direction, judging by Old Ban's route, it was clear they weren't walking in a straight line, but rather winding and twisting in a very convoluted path.

From time to time, Old Ban would stop to observe the nearby terrain, then change direction.

Sometimes, he would even stand in one place for a long time, doing nothing, only moving on after quite a while.

Yang Kai knew his earlier guess was correct. This best guide in the Desolate City must have mastered a safe passage in and out of the Ancient Land.

But after all, this was someone else's secret, and it was Old Ban's means of survival, so Yang Kai didn't rashly try to pry.

Half a day later, Yang Kai still didn't know where they were. After Zhang Ruoxi casually dealt with another Yin-Soul, Old Ban, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped, his nostrils flaring as he sniffed rapidly, making quick inhaling sounds.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, realizing Old Ban must have discovered something, and immediately released his Divine Sense to closely monitor his movements.

After sniffing for a while, Old Ban's expression suddenly changed dramatically. He shouted, "You two, stay close to me! Don't fall behind, not even a step!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he leapt forward, speeding ahead.

Old Ban had been extremely cautious all along, never daring to be reckless, but now he was so urgent—it was obvious he had discovered something.

Although Yang Kai wasn't as experienced as Old Ban, a sense of crisis instinctively welled up in his heart, as if some danger was approaching.

Now that he was in the Emperor Realm, this instinct was extremely sharp. The moment Old Ban moved, he knew something was wrong.

He immediately activated his Emperor Yuan, shielding Zhang Ruoxi, and strode forward, closely following Old Ban.

Zhang Ruoxi didn't say a word, but the look on her small face betrayed her nervousness and unease.

The three of them quickly dashed through the strange mist. After less than ten breaths, Old Ban suddenly gasped, his body, which had been charging forward, abruptly halted. Then, with a tap of his foot, he shot backward, shouting, "Retreat!"

Yang Kai's reaction was naturally quick. Although he had been following not far behind Old Ban, the moment Old Ban retreated, he also moved back.

At the same time, Yang Kai's Divine Sense locked tightly onto a spot ahead—he felt something was different there.

Crack—

Before Yang Kai could investigate further, a sudden thunderclap exploded. A purple bolt of lightning fell from the sky, striking the ground and blasting out a pit about ten zhang in diameter. Everything around the pit was obliterated, reduced to ashes.

Yang Kai grunted, a deep look of dread flashing in his eyes. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead as he gritted his teeth and said, "Soul-Extinguishing Divine Thunder!"

He had only been curious to see what would happen ahead, but when that bolt of lightning struck, it directly severed the Divine Sense thread he had sent out.

In the face of that thunder's power, his Divine Sense, which was as strong as that of a Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, was as laughable as a child's. If it had been an ordinary person, they would probably be rolling on the ground, howling in pain.

Although Yang Kai felt terrible, he was at least protected by the Warm Spirit Lotus. A cool sensation from the Warm Spirit Lotus flowed into his mind, greatly easing his pain. So, although his face was pale, he was otherwise unharmed.

The spot where the lightning struck was exactly where Old Ban had been heading.

One could imagine, if Old Ban hadn't retreated at the critical moment, with his First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, he would have been utterly destroyed.

Who knows how he possessed such a seemingly prophetic ability, able to avoid danger at the last moment.

"Follow me!" Old Ban didn't pause for a moment, shouting loudly.

Yang Kai dared not delay and hurried after him.

Five breaths later, a crackling sound suddenly came from behind, and even the ground beneath their feet began to shake, as if thousands of troops and horses were trampling across the land.

Although Yang Kai couldn't see what was happening behind them, from the terrifying commotion, he could guess that many purple bolts of lightning had struck that area.

He admired Old Ban even more in his heart.

Previously, when Pi San told him to find Old Ban as a guide into the Ancient Land, he hadn't refused, but he only did so with a take-it-or-leave-it attitude.

He thought that with his current strength, entering the Ancient Land wouldn't be a problem.

But after this experience, he realized he had been too naive.

The power of that lightning was immense. If Old Ban hadn't led him and Zhang Ruoxi to safety with his prophetic sense, even with his cultivation, being struck would have been disastrous.

The lightning was so terrifying and completely unpredictable, not to mention the strange mist here that could make even Emperor Realm experts lose their way for ten years.

Crackle—

The sound of purple lightning striking came from all directions. Even though the strange mist blocked their vision, Yang Kai could still faintly see streaks of purple light refracted through the thick fog. Lightning danced through the mist like rampaging demons, extremely frightening.

It seemed as if they had entered a sea of lightning, with danger lurking everywhere.

Zhang Ruoxi didn't dare move at all, letting Yang Kai wrap her in his Emperor Yuan and go with the flow.

Old Ban led the way ahead, his direction constantly shifting. It seemed random, but miraculously, he always managed to guide Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi out of the lightning's range.

He was like the most experienced sailor— even with just a wooden raft, he could conquer the vast sea and see its most enchanting sights.

A miserable scream suddenly came from nearby. It seemed a cultivator had been struck by lightning, crying for help in a voice filled with agony.

But it lasted only a moment before it abruptly stopped, as if someone had choked off his throat.

One could imagine that cultivator's fate.

The Yin-Souls that had been everywhere were now completely gone. As the three of them passed, not even a single ghostly shadow could be seen.

Old Ban always managed to change direction at the most critical moments, avoiding the spots where purple lightning struck, allowing the three of them to travel safely through danger.

Who knew how long they ran, but gradually the sound of thunder faded, until finally there was not a single sound left.

After rushing forward for a long time, Old Ban finally stopped, panting, his face pale and bloodless.

Yang Kai stopped right behind him, his Divine Sense constantly monitoring the surroundings, ready for anything.

"Sir, are you alright?" Zhang Ruoxi asked Yang Kai nervously.

When the first bolt of lightning struck earlier, Yang Kai had clearly been injured, but at that time she hadn't dared disturb him. Only now that they were safe did she dare to ask.

Yang Kai shook his head, indicating he was fine, then looked at Old Ban and asked, "Old Ban, are we safe now?"

He was still very wary of that Soul-Extinguishing Divine Thunder.
