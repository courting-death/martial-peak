## Chapter 346 — Unexpected Complications

Time had never flowed so slowly.

Under the pressure of imminent death, everyone's spirits were tense, their hearts racing.

Those pairs of eyes were constantly watching the condition of the True Yang Yuan Qi barrier.

The shattering of each layer of the barrier seemed to chill the hearts of all present.

As time passed, the twenty layers of barrier finally broke completely. Yang Kai had already condensed a new barrier to protect everyone, making them even more grateful.

Around them, the Corrupted Fountain Water was filled with wandering evil spirits, and enormous bubbles rose from the depths.

The temperature suddenly dropped.

Everyone present were martial artists of the True Essence Realm, protected by True Essence, so the usual cold posed no threat to them. However, those with slightly lower cultivations had already seen their hair coated in white frost, shivering despite hugging their arms, with their breath appearing as white mist.

Even those of higher cultivation were starting to struggle. Among the crowd, only Yang Kai remained unaffected by the cold.

It felt as if the Corrupted Fountain Water harbored an icy cold that penetrated to the depths of their souls, eroding everyone's warmth.

Boom, boom...

The commotion from the Evil Spirit Spring Eye continued without pause, growing increasingly intense. Each tremor caused the high platform to bounce several times.

Bang, bang...

Giant bubbles around them burst one after another, unleashing all sorts of dangerous and eerie evil energy.

The True Yang Yuan Qi barrier continued to shatter, layer by layer, and Yang Kai's expression gradually grew heavy.

After a short while, a sudden rapid and thunderous sound echoed from the direction of the Evil Spirit Spring Eye.

Following the sound, all other disturbances abruptly ceased.

The crowd was startled, exchanging bewildered glances.

Before they could figure out what had happened, an extremely cold and dense energy suddenly surged towards them from that direction. It felt like the bitter wind blowing from a snow-capped peak that had not melted in ten thousand years and like the chilling ghost winds from the Netherworld. Everyone couldn't help but shiver.

Crack, crack...

The True Yang Yuan Qi barrier covering the high platform unexpectedly developed a layer of ice shards, a scene that shocked everyone.

The chilling energy and the evil energy were both consuming the True Yang Yuan Qi barrier, causing its disappearance rate to double.

"No way!" Cheng Ying gasped, his expression full of bitterness. They had already been on edge, struggling to resist; now, with such a change occurring, it was evidently pushing them towards doom.

Before his words fell, the surrounding Corrupted Fountain Water suddenly surged toward one direction, pulling the evil spirits swimming within along with it.

It seemed a gigantic whirlpool had appeared, devouring everything in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

Countless piercing wails echoed as many evil spirits struggled.

The crowd on the high platform also felt the force pulling them, but fortunately, as they were within the barrier, they wouldn’t be sucked into the Corrupted Fountain Water.

A slight operation of True Essence was enough to offset that pulling force.

"What happened?" Shen Yi frowned as he looked over. Not far away, he saw a ghostly light emanating from the spot where the Evil Spirit Spring Eye was located.

The light was not very bright but was enough to penetrate the ink-like fountain water.

The source of the evil spirits! The Evil Spirit Spring Eye contained the essence of the evil spirits!

That was the treasure the old man had desired earlier. Unfortunately, he had died before witnessing it appear.

All of this was converging towards that cluster of evil spirit essence. It resembled a heart, pulsing with a rhythmic thump while absorbing energy to gradually revive.

Slowly, the light vanished. It seemed to be blocked by the rushing fountain water.

Bang...

The True Yang barrier continued to shatter, layer after layer.

Yang Kai concentrated, preparing to expend another twenty drops of Yang Liquid to reinforce the barrier when Leng Shan suddenly exclaimed with great joy, "The fountain water is retreating!"

Upon hearing this, everyone felt a surge of hope, turning their gaze in her direction to see indeed some light coming from the side, belonging to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

The fountain water that filled the entire area was rapidly surging back towards the spring eye, naturally vacating the region they occupied. 

"Ha ha, good fortune comes to those who deserve it!" Shen Yi laughed heartily. He originally feared they were truly doomed this time, but unexpectedly, at the last moment, the fountain water had actually begun to withdraw.

At this rate, it seemed that soon, the fountain water around the high platform would completely disappear.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, solemnly advising, "Once it's safe, leave immediately. There are likely to be great changes ahead."

"What do you mean?" Leng Shan stared, confused.

"A big creature is taking shape!" Yang Kai's face darkened as he fixed his gaze on the direction of the spring eye.

The others lacked Divine Sense and could only sense the powerful energy fluctuations from the spring eye, but Yang Kai felt it more acutely.

Nearby fountain waters and the surviving evil spirits were being drawn in, all transforming into a sort of evil energy that fused together.

Centered around the emerging evil spirit essence, they began to shape a body.

With so massive an energy gathering, this newly formed entity would surely be terrifying in nature.

Moments later, the surrounding fountain water finally receded.

"Go!" Yang Kai shouted decisively, and everyone leaped off the platform, flying toward the exit.

Having finally gained a chance to escape, whether from the Ghost King Valley or the Baoqi Sect, they all moved faster than rabbits, wishing they had a couple more legs. Their True Essence was in fierce motion, and with their movement techniques activated, they even employed auxiliary treasures, eager to put as much distance as possible between them and this place of troubles.

Yang Kai already moved swiftly, leading the charge, with the Hu sisters right beside him. They seemed to be using some mysterious technique, their True Essence somehow linked together, effortlessly keeping pace with Yang Kai.

After flying ten miles, a suddenly resounding roar echoed behind them.

The roar shook the entire Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, as if a long-captive ferocious beast had broken free, seeing the light of day once again.

Following that, a wave of immense force surged from behind, and had they not been distant enough, everyone would have likely been swept away.

Realizing they were in the presence of something enormously powerful and terrifying, everyone's expressions changed, and they pushed themselves even harder.

With this almost frantic pace, they naturally moved swiftly.

"Over there, the exit is that way!" Cheng Ying, usually responsible for scouting the terrain, was most familiar with the layout of the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

Following his gesture, Yang Kai indeed spotted a glimmer of light coming from some distance above, quickly altering course and leading everyone toward it.

They all couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, wishing to escape the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave immediately.

However, just as they were two miles from the exit, several experts in the Divine Roaming Realm suddenly flew over.

Yang Kai squinted his eyes, growing increasingly cautious.

These Divine Roaming Realm experts all exuded a dense killing intent and an eerie aura, clearly not good people.

It was unsurprising that such a major incident occurred in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, attracting nearby Divine Roaming Realm cultivators, but Yang Kai was frustrated they were flying towards his group, clearly intending to investigate the situation inside.

The distance between them rapidly closed, and the approaching Divine Roaming Realm experts did not regard Yang Kai's group with any importance. Before closing in, their leader shouted from a distance, "You over there, stop!"

Upon hearing this, everyone's heart sank, their expressions darkening.

In the midst of their desperate escape, just as they were about to soar to safety, they were suddenly obstructed, leaving anyone in a foul mood.

"They're the spirits under the Ghost King!" Leng Shan's face paled, quickly warning Yang Kai, "Those four, each has the strength of the seventh or eighth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm; we're no match for them."

Fearing that Yang Kai might foolishly provoke these four, she hastily spoke. Besides, these four were true evil, known for their numerous heinous deeds, even within the Cangyun Evil Land, they were widely disliked.

Yet, despite their levels only being seventh or eighth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, they were masters of combined attacks capable of facing peak experts, allowing them to enjoy a relatively smooth life despite having many enemies.

Moreover, they were also favored by the Yinming Ghost King!

Their tempers were erratic; should they feel displeased, they could annihilate everyone present in an instant.

Yang Kai naturally understood the stakes. Hearing the call, he quickly halted his steps, filled with urgency yet feeling utterly powerless.

The four elders flew forward in unison, their clothing similar in style but differing in color, representing their respective identities.

Chimei, Mei, Wang, and Liang—these four names corresponded to cyan, green, yellow, and purple.

The elder in cyan looked sternly at Yang Kai's group, asking in a low voice, "Who are you? Do you know what happened here?"

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, answering lightly, "We are from the Ghost King Valley, here for training, and we do not know what has transpired."

"Don’t know?" The cyan-clad elder snorted coldly, clearly sensing Yang Kai was lying.

"What's the point of talking nonsense with him? Just interrogate him on the way." The green-clad elder furrowed his brow.

"Indeed," the cyan-clad elder nodded, his form lunging toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's True Essence instinctively reacted, but he quickly suppressed it. Facing a seventh or eighth-stage expert from the Divine Roaming Realm, everyone here couldn’t defeat them even if they joined forces, let alone there were four of them.

Any rash movement would only worsen the situation!

The cyan-clad elder easily seized Yang Kai, not bothering to seal his cultivation, seemingly confident in himself, and in a flash, he dashed inside.

"You all go ahead! I will find you after I get out," Yang Kai could only shout to the others just before the elder disappeared from sight.

"Yang Kai!" The Hu sisters turned pale as they watched them get caught just as they were on the verge of escaping the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.
