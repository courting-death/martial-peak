## Chapter 670 — I Changed My Mind

Roars of beasts echoed one after another, the ground trembled and snow scattered; Ji Meng and Zhu Yingyue fled for their lives, no longer the calm, composed women Yang Kai had seen earlier. Their clothes were torn and stained with blood, and as they ran large swathes of pale skin were bared.

The bitter wind rushed in, making Zhu Yingyue shiver.

"Hurry!" Ji Meng shouted as they fled.

"Senior Brother Qi..." Zhu Yingyue said, glancing back; when she saw that ferocious Demonic Beast she went pale, terror hidden in her eyes.

"He's dead, don't look back." Ji Meng's expression was steady, but her heart was in turmoil — she had never expected to encounter an ice crystal wolf here.

The ice crystal wolf was a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast, its entire body harder than steel; the power of Secret Treasures and Martial Skills only left shallow marks on it.

Its speed was tremendous, its four claws and fangs unmatched in sharpness.

The three of them had been stunned at first sight; Qi Chao was ripped open and killed under the ice crystal wolf's jaws right before the two women's eyes, his death a tragic spectacle.

They had been here many times before with no trouble, yet this time disaster struck.

Compared to Ji Meng's composure, Zhu Yingyue was in a panic; under the threat of death her cultivation at Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage could not even manifest half its power, and she fled blindly. If Ji Meng had not periodically unleashed the power of her Secret Treasure to slow the ice crystal wolf, Zhu Yingyue would have been overtaken long ago.

"Sister Ji!" Zhu Yingyue cried out, voice breaking.

"If you don't want to die, don't cry!" Ji Meng warned gravely.

Zhu Yingyue hurriedly nodded.

Amid the snowstorm ahead stood a figure; Ji Meng's eyes brightened and she called out, "Friend ahead, can you help us?"

In that moment she seemed to glimpse hope.

The other party was standing there so confidently, clearly unafraid of the ice crystal wolf — perhaps a senior or fellow disciple of Divine Cult; if so, she and Zhu Yingyue would be saved.

No sooner had the words left her mouth than a burst of force shot forward from ahead.

It struck precisely at her feet. Sensing hostility, Ji Meng grabbed Zhu Yingyue and halted.

"What a coincidence!" a slightly mocking voice called from ahead as the person slowly approached.

Ji Meng immediately grew vigilant, her brows knitting together as she stared forward.

After a moment Ji Meng's expression faltered; she stared at Yang Kai in astonishment. Zhu Yingyue covered her mouth and exclaimed, "You're unharmed?"

"Did you hope I was harmed?" Yang Kai sneered lightly.

"No, we didn't mean that..." Zhu Yingyue hurriedly waved her hand, panic on her face.

"What about that man?" Yang Kai asked, looking around; Qi Chao's body was nowhere to be seen.

"Dead!" Ji Meng protected Zhu Yingyue and answered coldly, "Killed by the ice crystal wolf."

"Dead?" Yang Kai's expression flickered.

"I admit we were wrong before — Qi Chao shouldn't have misled you, and I should have warned you. But can we talk about this later?" Ji Meng urged, "If we don't leave now it will be too late. The ice crystal wolf chasing us is a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast; no one can withstand it!"

Yang Kai frowned and shook his head, "It's already too late!"

As he spoke, a whistling sound suddenly swept through the air.

A cold, murderous intent hung about; Ji Meng's face changed as she spun around, her fingers weaving and releasing threads that met the ice shards attacking from behind.

Boom, boom, boom...

Countless ice shards shattered, sending up a white fog. Ji Meng let out a muffled grunt as an ice shard grazed her tender shoulder, drawing blood.

A massive figure suddenly landed before the three of them — the ferocious ice crystal wolf baring its fangs, exuding a rank stench. Its eyes, the size of copper bells, fixed on Ji Meng and Zhu Yingyue; saliva dripped from its mouth, vicious and murderous.

As the wolf lunged, Yang Kai leaped into the air to look down and noticed this beast was crystalline throughout, like a sculpture of jade, almost beautiful in appearance; its fur was smooth and it gave off a towering Violent Aura.

Ji Meng and Zhu Yingyue's faces drained — Yang Kai's delay meant they could no longer escape the wolf's reach. Refusing to be passive, Ji Meng hastily produced a Secret Treasure crackling with arcs of electricity, infused it with True Yuan, and struck at the wolf.

At the same time, Zhu Yingyue's hands trembled as she deployed her own Secret Treasure; a fan waved and visible wind blades swept toward the ice crystal wolf.

Their combined attack had considerable force.

But against the thick-skinned ice crystal wolf, those attacks were like tickles.

Sparks flew across its burly body; the ice crystal wolf remained unscathed. Its maw opened in a roar and ice shards quickly formed, lashing at Ji Meng and Zhu Yingyue.

The two women tumbled helplessly and still suffered injuries, blood flowing and only fueling the wolf's brutality.

Before they could rise, countless ice shards wove into an impenetrable net of attacks, forcing the two women to keep their heads bowed.

Snow flew everywhere in the chaos.

Ji Meng looked up in desperation and called toward Yang Kai standing in the sky, "Can you help us?"

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, his expression cold.

Although Qi Chao, who had deceived him earlier, had been gruesomely killed by the wolf, those two had not warned him at the time, and Yang Kai was angry.

They had wasted six or seven days of his time.

Seeing Yang Kai's resolute refusal, Ji Meng realized he still harbored resentment over the earlier matter and quickly cried, "It was our fault before — Qi Chao lied to you, we share the blame. But you can't watch us die!"

"Why should I save you? I nearly died too." Yang Kai's face was icy as he stood aloof.

The ice crystal wolf leapt forward; Ji Meng sprang aside but was still clawed in the abdomen, her garments torn open to reveal a flat belly and a delicate navel.

Dark red blood flowed from her wound. Gritting her teeth, Ji Meng endured and continued to maneuver against the wolf.

Zhu Yingyue hurried to assist.

Together they could not repel the ice crystal wolf, yet they sensed the Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast had no intention of killing them outright; it toyed with them like a cat with a mouse, holding back and taking pleasure in their torment, even showing a mocking expression in its eyes.

A Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast already possessed notable intelligence; given enough resources and conditions, it might even assume human form and join the ranks of the yao.

Realizing this, Ji Meng pleaded with Yang Kai again, "We are disciples of the Leiguang Divine Cult. If you save us, once we return we'll compensate you for your losses. Qi Chao is dead — you should calm down, right?"

"Leiguang Divine Cult?" Yang Kai's expression shifted; he felt he'd heard of that sect somewhere, but he couldn't recall where.

Believing he might have some connection with her sect, Ji Meng's face lit with hope as she asked, "Do you know people in my Divine Cult?"

"Sorry, I don't." Yang Kai shook his head.

"You bastard!" Ji Meng seethed, maddened with anxiety; she cursed through clenched teeth, wishing she could rush up and kill Yang Kai. She had been somewhat sympathetic to the man earlier for having been deceived, but now he seemed utterly detestable — he deserved to die in these mountains and be out of sight.

"You watch us die and won't lift a finger — are you even a man?" Ji Meng shouted.

Yang Kai remained unruffled, saying, "There's nothing wrong with saving you, but what happened before left me displeased. If I'm unhappy, you won't get to be happy. If you survive, I'll gladly let you test whether I'm a man."

As he spoke, the two women grew increasingly overwhelmed by the wolf's assault. Ji Meng ground her teeth, "What do you want to be satisfied? Tell me your demand and I'll do it all!"

"I don't want anything." Yang Kai shook his head slowly, assuming an attitude of standing aside to watch the show.

Ji Meng was furious, nearly spitting blood!

Yang Kai's calm confidence made her realize this man likely had the means to deal with the ice crystal wolf — at least enough to have escaped from such a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast himself. Otherwise he would not be so composed. Yet his posture of watching without acting left Ji Meng powerless.

"Please, I'm begging you, will you?" Ji Meng bit her lip, suppressing the shame and hatred welling in her heart, and spoke in a softer, pleading voice.

"Senior Brother, I'm begging you too." Zhu Yingyue looked at Yang Kai pitifully, her eyes watery; though terrified, she kept pleading.

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly as he looked into her pleading eyes; the chill on his face gradually faded.

He suddenly realized this woman's eyes resembled Xia Ningshang's — the same innocent clarity, utterly free of impurity.

Yang Kai remained silent for a long moment and still gave no sign of helping; Ji Meng thought him truly heartless and determined to watch to the end.

A chill rose in her chest and she bit back a smile, "Yingyue, don't beg him. We're probably going to die here. Before we go, remember how he looks — even as vengeful spirits we'll haunt him so his mind never rests!"

She glared coldly at Yang Kai as she spoke.

Yang Kai gave a wry laugh, "You woman, you truly have a heart of venom!"

"You're no better!" Ji Meng snapped back.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious and he said, "From the way you've been fighting, can you escape?"

It wasn't that her power was vastly greater than the other's; rather, in danger she did not waver and could exert her full strength. Even though the ice crystal wolf was a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast, if she were at Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage, she could hold out and run for a while.

The other woman was different — she truly seemed terrified, her attacks chaotic and clumsy, obviously someone raised under protection; a person like that must hold a significant status.

"If I run, what about Yingyue? I won't be as despicable as you!" Ji Meng gritted her teeth and hissed.

"At least you have loyalty and righteousness!" Yang Kai nodded slightly, then suddenly cracked a grin, "I've changed my mind. I can save you!"
