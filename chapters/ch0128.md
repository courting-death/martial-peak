## Chapter 128 â€” The Martial Technique Hidden Within the Little Stone Man

Indeed, the strength was not high! Zuo An's expression immediately calmed down as he single-handedly blocked a stone sculpture in place.

Yang Kai and Du Yishuang led another stone sculpture flying a hundred zhang away, then exchanged a glance and hurriedly stopped, facing the stone sculpture head-on.

Du Yishuang seemed to employ some martial technique, her hands flying as golden light radiated from her palms, causing the stone sculpture to stagger, with fragments flying out.

The stone sculpture, clearly unaware of pain, retaliated fiercely despite its awkwardness.

Du Yishuang quickly jumped back, and Yang Kai took the opportunity to close in, the wind from his palm howling as he dealt another light blow to the stone sculpture.

At that moment, Lan Chudie and Nie Yong also arrived. The former silently joined the fray, while Nie Yong shot a resentful glare at Yang Kai, as if blaming him for leading the stone sculpture to chase after him.

One had to admit that Lan Chudie was somewhat observant; just from the earlier attack by Yang Kai and Du Yishuang, she had assessed the depth of the stone sculpture's strength.

This stone sculpture's attacks were indeed powerful, after all, its body was made of stone, and a single punch could easily carry a force of several thousand jin.

However, it could not endure much punishment! Moreover, its reactions were quite slow; despite some speed, it posed no threat to anyone present.

As they besieged it, cracks began to appear on the stone sculpture's body, rendering it battered and broken.

The four, seeing victory in sight, intensified their attacks.

Before long, this stone sculpture was thoroughly smashed into fragments.

None of the four were injured, though they had expended quite a bit of Yuan Qi.

Lan Chudie hurried forward to search among the rubble but found nothing, her brows furrowing slightly as she murmured, "Strange!"

In her view, the reason these lifeless stone sculptures could move must be due to some hidden mechanism. Yet now, she found nothing, leaving her somewhat disappointed.

"Let's go to Zuo An!" Lan Chudie did not linger, leading the others back along the same path.

Meanwhile, Zuo An was circling around the stone sculpture. At first, he had exchanged blows with it, but after realizing he was no match in strength and had even bruised his fists, he learned to be more cautious. Lan Chudie had only instructed him to hold it back, not to kill it.

After a considerable time, just as Zuo An was feeling anxious, Lan Chudie and the others appeared. Without a word, they all charged toward the stone sculpture.

Having gained experience from the previous encounter, dealing with this stone sculpture became much simpler, especially with Zuo An's added strength.

In less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, this stone sculpture was once again reduced to rubble.

All five were panting, and although this battle posed no life-threatening danger, the toll on their bodies was significant.

"What did you mean by that, Yang Kai!" Nie Yong glared at Yang Kai. "Don't think I won't dare to act against you just because we are from the same sect."

"What?" Yang Kai glanced at him indifferently.

"Why did you lead those two stone sculptures to chase after me just now!"

"Did I?" Yang Kai's gaze flickered, his expression calm yet revealing a hint of impatience. He had been too focused on running to care about anyone else.

"Enough arguing!" Lan Chudie, taking on the demeanor of a senior sister, shot a glare at the two, then moved to investigate the rubble.

"Remember this. If you use such underhanded tactics again next time, don't blame me for being rude!" Nie Yong's expression was cold and stern.

"Eh..." Suddenly, Lan Chudie exclaimed in surprise, reaching into the rubble and pulling out a small stone man, about the size of an infant's fist.

Her exclamation drew everyone's attention, and they quickly turned to look at what she held.

This little stone man was not large, but it was carved from an unknown material that appeared translucent and beautiful, resembling jade.

Inside the little stone man, red lines crisscrossed like human veins, and upon a rough count, there were more than thirty of these red lines.

"What is this..." Zuo An exclaimed in wonder, his eyes fixed on the little stone man. Yang Kai and Du Yishuang also approached, forming a circle around it, each filled with curiosity.

"Is this little stone man made of jade?" Nie Yong asked excitedly.

"Doesn't seem like it!" Lan Chudie shook her head. Although she did not recognize the material, she felt no energy emanating from the little stone man. However, the red lines inside contained some mysteries, circulating in a rhythmic manner.

"What do you all think?" Lan Chudie looked up at the others.

"Could we control those stone sculptures through this thing?" Zuo An suddenly proposed a possibility.

The others' eyes brightened, but Lan Chudie quickly dismissed it: "That shouldn't be the case. Among the two stone sculptures earlier, one of them did not contain a little stone man, and even if it did, the one we just defeated has already been smashed to pieces. How could we control it?"

Yang Kai's expression shifted, and he suddenly spoke up, "Don't you all think that the red lines inside resemble something?"

"Resemble what? Don't speak out of turn if you don't understand anything! A mere Open Origin Realm is trying to give orders!" Nie Yong completely dismissed Yang Kai, retorting without mercy.

Yang Kai's lips curled into a cold smile. Though he had a good temper, he would not remain indifferent to repeated provocations.

Lan Chudie sensed the subtle tension between the two and quickly intervened, "We are all from the same sect, so let's not quarrel. Yang Kai, what do you think it resembles?"

Yang Kai's eyes flickered for a moment before he said, "Don't you all think these red lines look like the meridians in our bodies?"

"Did you need to say that? I noticed it long ago!" Nie Yong scoffed.

Lan Chudie looked at Yang Kai with sparkling eyes: "Are you saying..."

"The way these red lines operate should be a method for cultivating a martial technique!" Yang Kai spoke with certainty.

"Ridiculous..." Nie Yong was about to retort again, but Du Yishuang suddenly stepped forward, her serene face turning cold as she rebuked, "Shut up!"

Nie Yong was taken aback, looking at Du Yishuang with some trepidation. He did not regard Yang Kai highly, but Du Yishuang's strength surpassed his by two minor stages. If it came to a fight, he might not be her opponent.

Zuo An also shot him a disdainful glance, muttering, "You're annoying!"

This was the plain truth; he did not mean to defend Yang Kai.

Nie Yong's face flushed red in an instant. He had not expected that two among them would support Yang Kai. He had the intention to cause a scene but lacked the courage, only able to huff coldly while his gaze toward Yang Kai grew increasingly hostile.

Lan Chudie ignored this, taking a deep breath as she held the little stone man and said solemnly, "If you all have no objections, I would like to investigate this thing. If what Yang Kai said is true, we will need to make other plans."

The others naturally understood what she meant and nodded in agreement.

Only then did Lan Chudie smile, "Then I will trouble you all to guard me."

With that, she closed her eyes, circulating her Yuan Qi into the little stone man in her hand.

In a short while, Lan Chudie opened her eyes in delight, her gaze sparkling as she looked at Yang Kai: "You were right; this little stone man indeed hides a method for cultivating a martial technique."

The four were all moved.

"I didn't examine it in detail, so I don't know what martial technique it is, but its level is definitely not low. At the very least, it is a Middle-Level Earth-Grade martial technique!"

With over thirty red lines in the little stone man, it meant that this martial technique required the support of more than thirty meridians. Lan Chudie's assertion of it being a Middle-Level Earth-Grade was already a conservative estimate; it could very well be a Upper-Level Earth-Grade technique.

This revelation not only made the other three breathe heavily but also excited Yang Kai.

Speaking of which, after the fierce battle in Jiuyin Valley that night, Yang Kai had realized one of his shortcomings!

The lack of martial techniques.

He did not possess a set of offensive martial techniques that he could use! All his attacks relied on his Yang Liquid, which was a significant flaw.

The Unyielding Will was a decent martial technique, but it was not offensive; it was merely an auxiliary technique.

If he had had a set of Earth-Grade offensive martial techniques during the battle in Jiuyin Valley, the fight would not have been so arduous. However, Yang Kai had few contribution points and a low status in the sect, making it impossible for him to purchase any decent martial techniques for cultivation.

Even a set of Lower-Level Earth-Grade martial techniques would require at least four to five hundred contribution points to exchange for, and the selection was certainly limited.

But now, a martial technique had appeared.

Since a little stone man could emerge from the stone sculpture, it was naturally possible for two, three, or even more to appear!

After all, there were over a hundred stone sculptures!

The allure of Earth-Grade martial techniques was simply too great for everyone present.

In an instant, Lan Chudie secretly rejoiced at having made the right decision at that time. If she had not resolved to shatter those two stone sculptures, she would not have obtained this little stone man and would have had no way of knowing the wealth hidden within the stone sculptures!

"What do you all think?" Lan Chudie looked at the excited crowd, a beautiful smile gracing her lips. Though she was asking, she already knew their answer.

"Let's do it!" Zuo An stated .

"Since the stone sculpture hides a martial technique, we naturally cannot let it go." Nie Yong's eyes sparkled with excitement, his demeanor almost animated. "Truly worthy of being a place of inheritance; we have only just entered and already discovered such a treasure!"

Yang Kai and Du Yishuang nodded in agreement.

"Alright, since everyone agrees, let's put in some effort here!" Lan Chudie smiled sweetly. "I will keep this little stone man for now, and once we gather enough, we will distribute it. Rest assured, I will not investigate the hidden martial technique on my own."

"I trust you, Senior Sister Lan." Nie Yong quickly pledged his loyalty, then turned to the others, "Senior Sister Lan is quite renowned within Lingxiao Pavilion; I, Nie, guarantee with my integrity that she will not deceive you."

With this said, Zuo An and Du Yishuang naturally had no objections. Moreover, aside from this approach, there was no better way to handle it, as there was currently only one little stone man.

Having decided to make a big score here, the next step was to discuss how to proceed.

The strength of the stone sculptures had already been experienced by everyone; the combat power of such things, when alone, was likely higher than any of them present. Its strengths were evident: fast speed and great strength! It absolutely could not be hit.

The weaknesses were also clear; it could not think, and running around the stone pillars would shake it off, as its reactions were relatively slow.
