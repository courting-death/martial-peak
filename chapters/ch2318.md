## Chapter 2318 — Reunion with Ghost Ancestor

"Fourth Brother, you’re being foolish!" The second elder frowned at these words and rebuked him.

The last, a fierce-looking middle-aged man, burst out laughing, "Since things have come to this, let’s just turn this place upside down!"

As he spoke, he really was about to make a move.

Chi Yue, seeing they still hadn’t grasped the situation, looked exasperated and said, "Wait, take a look at who this is."

The three were stunned, then followed her gesture and looked in that direction.

At a glance, all three were visibly shaken, their eyes wide with disbelief, as if they’d seen a ghost in broad daylight.

"Honored Seniors, it’s been a long time!" Yang Kai greeted them with a beaming smile and a cupped fist.

"Sect Master?" Ghost Ancestor exclaimed. Even he, who had weathered countless storms, couldn’t help but tremble with excitement.

"Sect Master Yang?"

"Yang boy?"

Gu Cangyun and Chairman Ai Ou also cried out in surprise, as if caught in a dream.

Chi Yue smiled, "Today’s events are all thanks to him. You three were only able to escape because of him."

Hearing this, the three’s expressions grew solemn. They quickly released their Divine Sense to probe Yang Kai’s cultivation, and when they saw he had reached the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, they couldn’t help but gasp.

They remembered that when they set out from the Star Domain, Yang Kai’s cultivation had been only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm; who would have thought that after two or three years he would now be ahead of them?

Such rapid progress was truly enough to make others break out in a cold sweat.

Having such cultivation was one thing, but from Chi Yue’s words, it seemed that everything today had started and ended because of Yang Kai.

The air was thick with the stench of blood. On the wall, the character for "death" was written in fresh blood and flesh, shocking to behold. Luo Jin, City Lord of Tianhe City, had been stabbed in the chest with a broad longsword and dared not move. The surrounding guests’ eyes were filled with shock and fear.

The three were all seasoned veterans. With just a glance around, they understood most of what had happened, and their hearts grew even more shocked.

How could someone at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm accomplish such a feat on another’s turf? Ghost Ancestor and the others simply couldn’t imagine it.

"Are the three of you well?" Yang Kai asked.

Ghost Ancestor replied, "Thank you for your concern, Sect Master. We’re all right."

Yang Kai also sensed they were unharmed. Luo Jin truly hadn’t mistreated them—he had only sealed their cultivation and imprisoned them in the dungeon. Now, the seals had been lifted and they had recovered.

After all, the three were only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. With the power Luo Jin controlled as City Lord, he hadn’t paid them much mind and didn’t bother to guard them too closely.

"We’ll talk in detail later. Let’s leave here first," Chi Yue suggested.

Ghost Ancestor raised his brows, gave a wicked grin, and looked at Luo Jin. "The soul of a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator—this Lord will gladly accept it."

As he spoke, he summoned his Ten Thousand Souls Banner. Instantly, a cold wind swept through the City Lord’s mansion. Ghostly wails echoed as visible black mist billowed out, transforming into blurry human figures that roamed in all directions.

The many guests turned pale, sensing the evil aura from this Secret Treasure. They were all terrified, unsure what kind of wicked art this old man cultivated, that even his Secret Treasure was so sinister.

"Don’t come any closer!" Luo Bing, though pale with fright, still stood protectively in front of Luo Jin, shouting loudly.

Luo Jin panicked as well, looking at Yang Kai, "Young Master Yang... I truly didn’t harm them! I’ve already released them as you asked. You can’t go back on your word!"

Yang Kai shot him a cold glance and raised a hand to stop Ghost Ancestor.

Ghost Ancestor didn’t know what Yang Kai intended, but he didn’t continue. He just kept grinning wickedly, sending chills down everyone’s spine.

Chai Hu swallowed and said, "Young Brother, Miss Luo helped me a lot before. She even brought me in here. Please don’t harm her."

Ghost Ancestor and the others all looked at Chai Hu with odd expressions.

Chai Hu said, "A man should distinguish between gratitude and grudges."

Chi Yue smiled, "Fourth Brother is right."

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then with a slight force, pulled out the Myriad Sword, bringing forth a spray of blood.

Luo Jin was instead overjoyed and quickly said, "Many thanks, Young Master Yang!"

However, before he finished, Yang Kai struck him in the chest with a palm. Caught off guard, Luo Jin was sent flying by the tremendous force, spitting a mouthful of blood in midair before crashing heavily to the ground, his aura withering.

"Father!" Luo Bing screamed, scrambling over to Luo Jin.

Luo Jin struggled to sit up, staring at Yang Kai in horror.

Only after being struck by Yang Kai did he truly realize how powerful this young man was. The Origin Qi within him was so vast and pure that even Luo Jin himself was inferior.

Was he really only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm?

If he advanced to the Third Stage, what would that be like? At that point, he’d be invincible beneath the Emperor Realm. The thought made Luo Jin break out in a cold sweat, terrified at having provoked such a monster.

"You should be grateful you have a good daughter!" Yang Kai snorted, then called to Ghost Ancestor and the others, "Let’s go!"

With that, he strode out. No one dared stop him; everyone made way as if avoiding the plague, keeping far from Yang Kai.

Ghost Ancestor and the others followed closely. On the other side, Ye Qinghan also called out, "Let’s go too!"

With that, she and Du Xian hurried after them.

The City Lord’s mansion fell silent. Even after Yang Kai and the others had left, no one dared speak loudly. All eyes turned to Luo Jin—some gloating, some sympathetic, some frowning in thought.

No matter what, after today Luo Jin’s prestige would plummet. At his own concubine-taking ceremony, not only was his bride snatched away, but such a scandal broke out, and he himself was gravely injured, his dignity gone.

With such a City Lord, who could submit?

Many secretly felt that Tianhe City was about to change.

Many cultivators lost interest in greeting Luo Jin. After waiting a while, they all left. In the blink of an eye, the lively ceremony became deserted, leaving only Luo Bing in tears, tending to her father.

Staring in the direction Yang Kai and the others had left, Luo Jin clenched his fists, his face twisted with resentment and hatred, eyes blazing with fury.

……

On the tower-ship, Du Xian arranged a private room for Yang Kai and the others, so they could talk in peace after their long-awaited reunion.

All of them had come from the Star Domain together, so there was no need to hide anything from each other.

After some casual conversation, Yang Kai finally learned what had happened to them after they were separated.

According to them, after the void shattered that day, they each fell out of the Starlight Passage and landed near Tianhe City. Though unfamiliar with the Star Realm, they concealed themselves well and weren’t exposed.

Two days later, by a series of coincidences, they regrouped and began searching for Yang Kai.

But no matter how they searched, they never found any trace of Yang Kai, nor of Liu Yan or Xiaoxiao.

After two months of fruitless searching, they had no choice but to focus on their own situation.

Life in Tianhe City was extremely difficult at first. Though they had been top experts in the Star Domain and quite wealthy, in the Star Realm they had to start from scratch. The Third Stage of the Void King Realm was nothing special in Tianhe City; even in Fenglin City, such cultivation was common, let alone here.

In this unfamiliar place, they had neither connections nor experience. Like newborns, they stumbled along, carefully hiding their origins from the lower Star Domain while struggling to earn Source Crystals for cultivation materials.

Fortunately, there was a training ground ten thousand li from Tianhe City where they could hunt Demonic Beasts together and sell their materials back in the city.

Source Crystals were saved bit by bit, and cultivation materials were bought little by little, not daring to waste a single one.

It was at this time that they met Chai Hu.

Though Chai Hu looked rough, he was open-hearted. After several collaborations, they became friends. Chai Hu, a native of Tianhe City, knew the area far better than Ghost Ancestor and the others. With his guidance, they earned Source Crystals much faster.

After many life-and-death battles and countless times helping each other, they formed a friendship with Chai Hu.

After one great battle, Wudao suddenly had an epiphany and reached the verge of a breakthrough.

Naturally, the others protected him as he attempted it.

But unexpectedly, Wudao failed at the critical moment of breaking through to the Dao Origin Realm and perished in the heavenly tribulation, leaving them all heartbroken.

After that, they swore brotherhood and vowed to support each other. After two or three years of effort, they all broke through to the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Ghost Ancestor and the others had already reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm back in the Star Domain. If not for the laws of heaven and earth there, they wouldn’t have come to the Star Realm to seek a higher Martial Dao.

So their breakthroughs came naturally, without much difficulty.

"Wait!" At this point, Yang Kai suddenly interrupted, "So, Senior Chai Hu is also in the Dao Origin Realm?"

Chai Hu and Ghost Ancestor had sworn brotherhood, so by rights he was Yang Kai’s elder, and Yang Kai naturally addressed him as Senior.

As he spoke, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense kept probing Chai Hu, because he clearly felt Chai Hu was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. But from what Ghost Ancestor and the others said, that didn’t seem to be the case.

This left him puzzled.

But no matter how Yang Kai sensed, he found Chai Hu was still only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, not a Dao Origin Realm cultivator.
