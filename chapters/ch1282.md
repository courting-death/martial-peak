## Chapter 1282 — A Most Fortuitous Encounter

Under the anxious gaze of the man surnamed Hou, a tremendous force suddenly pressed down on his shoulder; the strength was so great that the burly man crumpled, collapsing to the ground, face and nose caked in dust, utterly humiliated. He struggled wildly a few times, but the heavy foot Yang Kai had planted on his shoulder weighed like a mountain, leaving him unable to move. Dust-streaked cheeks flushed blood-red with shame and fury.

A hundred zhang away, Yin Sudie and the other cultivator surnamed Luo, who had arrived together, stared blankly at the unbelievable scene before them, utterly stunned, unable to believe their own eyes.

The two had been following Hou at a measured pace, chatting as they came, but they had seen the earlier scuffle between Yang Kai and Hou.

Everything had happened in a flash—faster than the eye could follow.

Hou had struck with full force, roaring arrogant orders for Yang Kai to get down; they had all heard his boasts clearly. Yet, to their shock, the one sprawled on the ground was not who they expected—it was their own fellow disciple.

Yin Sudie and the Luo martial artist both knew how strong Hou was; among the Saint King Realm practitioners within Liuli Sect, he ranked within the top ten. And yet this elite disciple had been flattened by Yang Kai in a single exchange, left like a dog, unable to right himself no matter how he struggled. How could Yin Sudie and Luo not be shaken?

No Saint King Realm practitioner in the entirety of Liuli Sect could perform to such a degree.

Did that mean Yang Kai was far stronger than the sect’s elites? Luo's expression flickered; he swallowed and imagined himself in the Hou’s place—likely the outcome would be no better.

Being defeated was one thing, but to lose face so publicly before Yin Sudie—after having boasted so loudly—meant this Senior Brother would likely be too ashamed to approach her again. Thinking this, the martial artist surnamed Luo felt a secret, guilty pleasure amid his shock.

For Yin Sudie, it was the first time she realized Yang Kai was so formidable. Although she had met him a few times, they had not been close; who would have thought such an unremarkable name hid such terrifying skill?

Perhaps even Fang Tianzhong and Qu Changfeng were not markedly more imposing; besides, Yang Kai seemed to have some connection with Senior Sister Daiyuan.

With that thought, Yin Sudie’s eyes took on a new light and she fixed her gaze unblinkingly on Yang Kai. Her thoughts turning, she murmured to Luo, “Senior Brother Luo, did you see that woman in the black robe over there?”

“Hmm? Junior Sister, any instructions?” the Luo martial artist replied, glancing in the direction of Yang Yan.

“Could you quietly seize that woman?” Yin Sudie smiled as if it were a trivial request.

Luo’s face shifted; though eager to take responsibility, he hesitated. “Junior Sister, look at the situation—if even Senior Brother Hou couldn’t withstand a single blow from that man, how could I seize the woman under his very nose? Besides, he doesn’t look like someone to provoke; it could backfire.”

“Rest assured, Senior Brother,” Yin Sudie smiled slightly. “If I suggest it, there is a plan. Leave him to me to occupy; you just need to capture that woman.”

Luo still hesitated, unwilling to agree outright.

Seeing this, Yin Sudie’s expression grew faint for a moment, then a gleam flashed across her eyes as if she’d thought of something. She said, “Senior Brother Luo, I didn’t tell you to harm her, only to seize her, so you won’t have someone coming after you later. Besides, with your cultivation of the Fleeting Light Evasion Technique, he likely can’t do much to you. Or is Senior Brother unable to grant Junior Sister such a small request?”

Hearing Yin Sudie’s words, the cultivator surnamed Luo pondered for a moment, then nodded and said, “Very well. Since Junior Sister holds Senior Brother in such regard, leave that woman to me. But Junior Sister, you must be careful as well—this Yang fellow doesn’t seem to be an ordinary person. Make sure you don’t suffer any loss at his hands.”

He appeared confident in his Fleeting Light Evasion Technique; even after witnessing Yang Kai knock Hou flat, he still agreed to Yin Sudie’s plan.

Yin Sudie giggled, fluttering like a blossom, “In a straight fight, Junior Sister likely wouldn’t be his match for ten moves, but I wouldn’t give him that chance.”

Luo turned to glance at Yin Sudie and suddenly noticed an almost imperceptible halo of light shimmering about her. The aura was formless yet compelling, stirring one’s spirit; in the next moment, Junior Sister’s delicate figure seemed to radiate an irresistible attraction that drew at his mind, unwilling to let his gaze wander.

Startled, Luo bit his tongue to snap himself back to clarity. His face paled in shock; he realized Junior Sister’s beguiling art had improved since before. That charm was beyond his ability to resist, and he found himself trusting her all the more.

At that instant, Yang Kai, still with a foot pressed on Hou's shoulder, raised his head and took in Yin Sudie and the Luo martial artist as if noticing them for the first time. Smiling, he called out, “Miss Yin—what a coincidence to run into you here. We must be very fortunate.”

“Fortunate, hmph…” Yin Sudie covered her mouth with a coquettish laugh, her eyes glittering with captivating light, and in a soft voice said, “It’s not a coincidence this time. I came through the space array from within Liuli Sect to the nearby city specifically to look for you.”

“Looking for me?” Yang Kai arched a brow and put on a mock expression of surprise. “What, Miss Yin has need of me?”

Yin Sudie’s smile faded into a look of complaint. “It’s nothing major, but did you forget our earlier arrangement? Didn’t you say when you had time you would come visit Wanren Peak? Yet you left without so much as a word. If Senior Sister Daiyuan’s hospitality was lacking, Junior Sister is here to make amends on her behalf—Daiyuan doesn’t handle social niceties well; I hope you won’t hold it against her.”

Saying this, she performed a graceful salute—every movement unconsciously radiating temptation—her bright eyes fixed on Yang Kai, issuing a subtle pull at his spirit.

Yang Kai feigned being flattered and hurriedly waved his hand, “You flatter me, miss. It wasn’t Senior Sister Daiyuan’s poor hospitality; I had pressing matters and could not linger in Liuli Sect, hence my hurried departure.”

At the same time his mind raced with relief: earlier the man surnamed Hou had claimed he broke Glazed Mountain’s formation, but since Yin Sudie made no mention of it, the Stone Puppet’s actions must not have been exposed. In that case, he had nothing to fear.

“I see!” Yin Sudie dipped her head and tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, revealing a delicate ear lobe. With a smile she said, “If you don’t mind, could you first release my rather inept Senior Brother? It seems there was a misunderstanding between him and you earlier. Since you’ve punished him, can you let him go?”

“He’s your Senior Brother?” Yang Kai’s face showed a flash of embarrassment. “So he’s from Liuli Sect as well. I thought some blind fool had come to make trouble and, without asking, I gave him a thrashing. My apologies—since he’s Miss Yin’s Senior Brother, I’ll return him to you.”

As he spoke, he casually kicked out, the top of his foot sweeping squarely into the abdomen of the burly man surnamed Hou.

A series of sharp cracking sounds rang out. The burly man surnamed Hou, whose face had been flushed red with shame a moment ago, suddenly turned pale. His body was sent flying into the air, crashing straight toward Yin Sudie.

Yin Sudie’s pretty face flickered; she had not expected Yang Kai to be so merciless. From the sound alone it seemed his sternum and ribs might have been half-shattered. The wounds were not fatal but serious enough—he would likely need three to four months of bed rest to fully recover.

A flash of annoyance crossed Yin Sudie’s eyes. Scolding that Yang Kai showed no mercy, she swept a slender hand forward and a cloudlike pink mist of energy materialized before her.

Hou’s body struck the pink cloud; it caved in like cotton and, in doing so, dissipated the force of his collision, sparing him further injury.

Yin Sudie then lifted her hand and placed it on his shoulder, turning him about twice. When she stopped, he was standing beside her once more, though his face shifted between green and white—as if he wished to bury himself in the earth from shame.

What hurt him most was that Yin Sudie did not even glance at him; having merely eased his fall, she then ignored his existence entirely, leaving him standing there dumbfounded.

Observing this, Yang Kai was secretly surprised. He had deliberately infused a touch of Saint Yuan into that kick, yet Yin Sudie had neutralized it without apparent effort. It was clear this woman was more than she appeared; to be Liuli Sect’s foremost elite disciple was no empty title.

“If Miss Yin has no further matters, I shall take my leave,” Yang Kai said, deciding not to prolong his entanglement with the woman. After all, she was Liuli Sect’s chief Elite Disciple—killing her was out of the question, and continued friction would only harm himself—so he immediately prepared to withdraw.
