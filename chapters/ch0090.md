## Chapter 90 — Destination

The valley before them was vast, spanning an area estimated to be several dozen li in diameter, and it was a perfectly circular valley.

Standing at the edge, Yang Kai looked down and saw that the valley floor was about thirty zhang below his current position. The bottom was lush and verdant, no different from the surrounding forest. The valley itself was picturesque, with clear mountains and flowing waters.

Xia Ningshang lowered her gaze to examine the bracelet on her wrist. After a moment, she exclaimed with delight, “Fortune favors us; there are no powerful Demonic Beasts here.”

As she spoke, she involuntarily breathed a sigh of relief. Along the way, she had managed to avoid the beasts blocking their path, but if there were any formidable monsters within this valley, they would have no choice but to fight. After all, this was precisely the place she sought.

“This place seems quite ordinary,” Yang Kai frowned.

“It only appears so because the time has not yet come,” Xia Ningshang smiled faintly. “If it weren’t for the seventh day of the seventh month last year, when my master and I happened to pass through here, we might never have uncovered the valley’s secret. It was then that my master resolved to have me refine the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.”

“Then why did he hesitate at the crucial moment? And you still haven’t told me how exactly I am supposed to help you seize that thing.”

Yang Kai had been traveling hard these past days and hadn’t pressed the matter, but now that they had arrived at their destination, he could not remain in the dark. If that Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew appeared and he did not know how to act, it could jeopardize everything.

So he had to ask clearly and prepare in advance.

“I will tell you when the time comes,” Xia Ningshang refused to answer.

Yang Kai was puzzled but did not press further. The whole affair was shrouded in mystery, and Shopkeeper Meng’s earlier attitude had also left him confused. But since he had promised to help, he would do his best when the moment arrived.

“Come here,” Xia Ningshang beckoned him.

Yang Kai looked at her curiously. “Why?”

“I’ll take you down,” Xia Ningshang blinked her big eyes. “It’s very high here.”

“I can manage on my own.” Yang Kai immediately declined. He was a man, after all; how could he let a woman carry him down? That would be disgraceful.

With that, he leapt forward. Amid Xia Ningshang’s startled cry, Yang Kai fell like a meteor plummeting from the sky, rapidly descending.

Xia Ningshang was terrified. Yang Kai’s strength was not high; falling headlong like that could be courting death. She immediately followed his pace, her figure light as a feather, ready to assist at the crucial moment.

The speed of the fall increased. When they were still about ten zhang from the ground, Yang Kai suddenly kicked off a nearby rock wall with a thunderous crash. Using the rebound, he flipped several times, dissipating much of the impact, then shot off diagonally with reckless abandon.

With a heavy thud, he landed on the ground, bending his knees slightly and creating a crater beneath him, dust billowing into the air.

Xia Ningshang lightly floated down beside him.

One like a fairy descending to the mortal realm, the other like a stubborn stone hitting the earth—visually, they could not have been more different.

But no matter the manner, he had landed safely.

Yang Kai’s face twitched subtly, his legs trembling faintly.

Suppressing a smile, Xia Ningshang’s sharp eyes easily discerned that her proud junior brother had just suffered a quiet defeat.

A height of thirty zhang, and with his Open Origin Realm Fourth Stage strength, he had only used one rebound to soften the fall—landing safely was nothing short of a miracle.

Feigning a glance around, Xia Ningshang said, “Today is the fifth day of the month, and in two days it will be the seventh. I must first make some arrangements within this valley. Junior Brother, you shall wait here. There is no danger in this place.”

Yang Kai’s expression grew stern, and he silently nodded.

Only then did Xia Ningshang dart off, but before disappearing, she turned back with a warning, “I will be busy for quite some time. Do not wander off, or I will not be able to find you.”

Yang Kai nodded again, his expression cold and handsome to a fault.

Only after Xia Ningshang’s figure vanished from sight did Yang Kai sit heavily on the ground, rubbing his legs incessantly, wincing in pain.

Although he had softened the impact considerably, the fall still hurt quite a bit.

After a long while, the numbness in his legs subsided. Not one to idle, he took the opportunity to survey the terrain nearby. Though Xia Ningshang had assured him there was no danger, a careful check could never hurt.

After investigating, he found nothing unusual within the valley.

It was not until the afternoon of the following day that Xia Ningshang returned.

Though he did not know what preparations she had made, her pale complexion revealed that the task had been taxing on both her spirit and Primordial Qi.

“I must recover first. At midnight tonight, this Jiuyin Convergence site will gather Yin energy. From then until dawn, we must find the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew and seize it. If we miss the timing, it will vanish again,” Xia Ningshang warned urgently, then produced several pills, swallowing them before closing her eyes to meditate.

Yang Kai stood guard silently by her side, motionless as a statue.

Several li away at the valley’s edge, members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower rested in disarray.

Following Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang deep into the Black Wind Mountains had been a costly endeavor.

Originally seventeen or eighteen strong, only thirteen remained. The others had perished under Demonic Beast attacks.

The Blood Battle Gang still had seven members, but they had lost a Separation and Union Realm expert. The remaining three Separation and Union disciples were all wounded, and even Wen Feichen bore a bloodied gash across his chest. The two Qi Movement Realm disciples were exhausted.

The Fengyu Tower’s minor players were down to six. Aside from Nu Lang, a Qi Movement Realm First Stage disciple, there were only four Open Origin Realm disciples and one Body Tempering Realm disciple who had been lucky enough to escape with only a fright, his mind somewhat clouded.

Among all present, only Long Hui remained unscathed.

His status was special; he was always protected during battles and thus escaped harm.

After days of pursuit, Long Hui had lost patience, his face darkening as he said, “Chief Wen, shall we continue the chase? If we press on, the losses will only grow. When Grandfather investigates, who will bear his wrath?”

Wen Feichen’s heart burned with anger. He knew Long Hui was trying to shift the blame onto him. He thought bitterly that he had only made this decision to please Long Hui. Had he known the journey would be so perilous, he would have killed Yang Kai back in that small town and saved himself the trouble.

Though he thought this, Wen Feichen still spoke calmly, “No need to pursue further. It seems they have reached their destination. The valley ahead is their goal.”
