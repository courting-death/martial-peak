## Chapter 2408 — I Am Innocent

The sudden turn of events happened in a flash, dazzling everyone present. The woman in red and the others hadn’t even figured out what was going on before Jiang Zhouzi was already gravely injured.

The group from Taiqing Island was all struck with terror, their faces filled with fear.

"Senior?" the woman in red muttered suspiciously. She had just heard Jiang Zhouzi address that young woman as 'Senior'—a term he wouldn't use lightly. Jiang Zhouzi was only a First Stage Emperor Realm expert. Could she be a peak Emperor Realm expert? Realizing this, the woman in red trembled, all her previous arrogance and disdain vanishing.

"Decisive." Bing Yun looked indifferent at Jiang Zhouzi, who had severed his own arm, showing no intention of finishing him off. It was unclear whether it was due to her kind nature or because her injuries made it inconvenient to continue fighting.

Still, Jiang Zhouzi was indeed a resolute person. If he hadn’t cut off his own arm at the critical moment, he would have died here. Though he looked miserable now, at least he had saved his life.

“Senior... I, Jiang, was blind and offended you before. Please, Senior, be magnanimous and spare our lives!” Jiang Zhouzi endured the piercing pain and pleaded for mercy.

Now, the lives of everyone from Taiqing Island were completely in the hands of this young woman. If she was unwilling to let them go, they would all surely die. Compared to their lives, pride was nothing. Begging a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert for mercy was not shameful at all.

Bing Yun looked at Jiang Zhouzi with a calm, indifferent expression, showing no joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness. This made Jiang Zhouzi feel suffocated, unsure what fate awaited them.

After a while, Bing Yun finally parted her red lips and waved her hand, “Leave!”

Jiang Zhouzi was overjoyed at her words and quickly said, “Thank you, Senior, for sparing us!” After speaking, he barked at the Taiqing Island group, “Go!”

No one from Taiqing Island dared to hesitate. They all hurriedly followed him away from this sea, each using all their strength, afraid Bing Yun would change her mind.

Yang Kai had no intention of stopping them either. He could tell that Bing Yun was in no condition to continue fighting. After all, the other side still had an Emperor Realm expert. If they were pushed to desperation, things could get ugly. Since they hadn’t suffered any real loss this time, it was better to let things go.

After the people from Taiqing Island left, Bing Yun looked around and sighed softly, “I didn’t expect we’d return directly to the Northern Territory!”

“Senior, is this really the Northern Territory?” Yang Kai raised his brows.

Bing Yun nodded, “Yes, this is the Ice Sea of the Northern Territory. Taiqing Island is a force on the Ice Sea, and it’s quite decent. Wenqing Sect is also in the Northern Territory, one of the top Sects here.”

Bing Yun was the founding ancestor of Ice Heart Valley in the Northern Territory and had lived here for countless years, so she was very familiar with the local powers and geography.

As she spoke, she glanced at Fan Xin and the others, “Do you want to visit your Sect?”

Fan Xin and the others nodded like pecking chicks. Although they had been accepted by Bing Yun, they had never been to Ice Heart Valley. They had long yearned for the Sect their Master had founded, and now that they had suddenly arrived in the Northern Territory, of course they wanted to see it.

“Then let’s go. I haven’t been back in a long time.” Bing Yun smiled slightly, then added, “I wonder how those little girls are doing now.”

The ‘little girls’ she mentioned were probably the first batch of disciples she had taken in after founding Ice Heart Valley. Yang Kai guessed they must all be Emperor Realm experts by now. Only Bing Yun could call them ‘little girls’.

“Senior, your injuries...” Yang Kai looked at her with some concern.

“I still need to recuperate, but as long as I don’t fight, it’s fine.” Bing Yun replied. Earlier, though she had gravely injured Jiang Zhouzi with one move, she hadn’t used much strength. Being able to do so with a single finger was partly because Jiang Zhouzi underestimated her and partly due to the difference in cultivation. For a Third Stage Emperor like Bing Yun, dealing with a First Stage like Jiang Zhouzi was effortless, even while injured.

Since Fan Xin and the others wanted to visit Ice Heart Valley, Yang Kai naturally had to go along. He thought that if Su Yan ever came to the Star Realm, perhaps she could also join Ice Heart Valley, since her cultivation method and physique were in line with its legacy.

Moreover, Yang Kai wanted to arrange for Liu Qianyun to enter Ice Heart Valley as well.

Liu Qianyun and he shared the bond of fellow disciples. They had supported each other through hardships recently, but he had his own matters to attend to and couldn’t always bring Liu Qianyun along.

Ice Heart Valley was definitely the best place for Liu Qianyun. It only accepted female disciples, and Liu Qianyun had the cultivation of a First Stage Dao Origin Realm, having come from a lower Star Domain. Her talent and tenacity were top-notch. Though her cultivation wasn’t high now, that was only because she’d lacked good resources. If the Sect nurtured her, her future achievements would be impressive.

Any martial artist who had ventured from a lower Star Domain had a promising future. Yang Kai believed Bing Yun wouldn’t refuse her.

He just hadn’t found the right opportunity to bring it up with Bing Yun yet.

As for Ling Yinqin and the others, Yang Kai didn’t know what they planned to do.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai turned to Ling Yinqin and asked, “Big Sister Ling, where do you want to go?”

Ling Yinqin pondered for a moment and said, “I want to go to the Eastern Territory!”

“Eastern Territory?” Yang Kai raised his brows, not knowing why she wanted to go there.

Bing Yun, standing to the side, said, “Since you’re Yang Kai’s friend and your cultivation is decent, if you wish to join my Ice Heart Valley, I can accept you.”

A Third Stage Dao Origin Realm was quite strong. With some luck, she might even advance to the Emperor Realm. Any Sect would welcome such a martial artist. Bing Yun’s offer was clearly for Yang Kai’s sake, knowing Ling Yinqin had just escaped from the Jixu Secret Realm and had nowhere to go for now.

Ling Yinqin smiled and said, “Thank you for your kindness, Senior. But... my late husband was from the Heavenly Wolf Valley in the Eastern Territory. I want to return his ashes there; it was his dying wish.”

Speaking of her deceased husband, Ling Yinqin’s expression dimmed, as if lost in memories, her eyes turning slightly red.

Bing Yun praised, “You are a devoted woman. The journey to the Eastern Territory is arduous, so be careful on the road. Once you’ve settled your husband’s ashes, if you still wish to come to Ice Heart Valley, you’re welcome anytime.”

Ling Yinqin replied gratefully, “Thank you for your great kindness, Senior!”

With Bing Yun’s words, Ling Yinqin now had a path forward—if she ever found herself with nowhere else to go, she could come to the Northern Territory and join Ice Heart Valley. It was a reassuring promise, giving her a place to belong should she need it.

“Let’s head inland first,” Bing Yun said to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded, summoned the Multi-deck Ship, and boarded with the group. Under Bing Yun’s guidance, they set off toward the inland.

The Ice Sea was unlike the Jixu Sea; their journey was smooth and uneventful. Bing Yun stayed in the cabin to heal, while Yang Kai told Liu Qianyun his plan to have her stay in Ice Heart Valley.

Liu Qianyun didn’t hesitate and agreed immediately.

She knew she couldn’t stay by Yang Kai’s side forever—the gap in their strength was too great. Staying would only hold him back. It was better to join Ice Heart Valley and cultivate within the Sect.

After Liu Qianyun agreed, Yang Kai found an opportunity to mention it to Bing Yun.

Bing Yun naturally didn’t refuse and agreed at once. As the founder of Ice Heart Valley, accepting a new disciple was just a word from her; there was no need to consult anyone else.

In just five days, they saw land ahead.

After gathering everyone on deck, Yang Kai glanced at Bing Yun and chuckled, “Senior, wouldn’t it be better to change your appearance?”

A few days ago, even someone like Jiang Zhouzi couldn’t help but be moved by Bing Yun’s beauty. Yang Kai was worried that after returning inland, her looks might cause trouble.

Fan Xin and the others giggled quietly at his words. Though they were all quite beautiful, compared to Bing Yun, they paled in comparison. Bing Yun’s pure, flawless beauty was unmatched, easily stirring a man’s desire to protect and possess.

“It’s exactly because of those sanctimonious scoundrels coveting beauties that women like us have so much trouble!” Bing Yun snorted unhappily.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, “Senior, why are you looking at me when you say that? I’m innocent!”

“Hmph!” Bing Yun snorted again but didn’t argue further, clearly aware that her beauty would always bring unnecessary trouble.

Yang Kai took out an item from his Spatial Ring and handed it to Bing Yun, “I have a mask here that would suit you, Senior. If you don’t mind, please take it.”

"This mask is well-made. Where did you get it?" Bing Yun glanced at the mask, as thin as a cicada’s wing, and praised it.

“It was probably made by Sangde,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Back when Sangde took him out to sea, Sangde had worn this mask. If Yang Kai hadn’t known in advance, he wouldn’t have recognized him. Later, Sangde was killed by Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi, so the mask became Yang Kai’s spoils.

Bing Yun’s jade hand, which had reached out, suddenly withdrew; her face was full of disdain. "That thing made it? He used it, didn’t he?"

“He did,” Yang Kai nodded.

Bing Yun glared at Yang Kai, “Then I don’t want it.”

Who knew what this kid was thinking, offering her something an old man had used—especially something to be worn on the face. What woman wouldn’t mind?

As she spoke, Bing Yun formed a hand seal, and her face began to shift slightly.

In a moment, her face became quite puffy. Though still beautiful, it no longer had the stunning effect from before.

“You’ve done this a lot, haven’t you, Senior?” Yang Kai saw how skillfully Bing Yun changed her appearance and immediately knew she was well-versed in this art.

Bing Yun said, “How else do you think I roamed the Star Realm alone in the past?”
