## Chapter 2205 — So Ruthless?

Qiong Qi had clearly noticed something about Zhang Ruoxi that even Yang Kai himself did not understand…

And that Ethereal Jade Disc—why did it only react to Zhang Ruoxi? What did those lightning-fast images flickering across its surface mean?

But since Zhang Ruoxi herself didn’t understand her own situation, Yang Kai couldn’t get any clear answers from her.

Someone with so many secrets, who could even make Qiong Qi step in to save her, was not to be underestimated.

Yang Kai could only hope she would grow stronger soon. Maybe, once her strength increased, she would naturally come to understand her own mysteries.

While Zhang Ruoxi was cultivating, Yang Kai didn’t disturb her. Instead, with a flicker he appeared in the loft where Hua Qingsi was.

He arrived without a sound, but Hua Qingsi seemed to sense something. Her delicate brows furrowed slightly, and when her beautiful eyes opened, she glared at Yang Kai, saying, “At least say something when you come in. You nearly scared me to death.”

“How was I supposed to know you were so timid?” Yang Kai grinned.

“The Four Seasons Land… it’s closed, right?” Hua Qingsi asked thoughtfully.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded.

“How were the gains?”

“So-so, I guess.”

Hua Qingsi pursed her lips and said, “You’re obviously not telling the truth. Did you get something good?”

Yang Kai laughed, “A little, yes.”

As he spoke, he produced a flawless, round Spiritual Pill, pinching it between two fingers.

“This is…” Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes narrowed as she stared at the Spiritual Pill, looking puzzled.

Though she didn’t know what kind of Spiritual Pill it was or what it did, she instinctively felt it was no ordinary item—likely something extremely rare and precious.

“Want it?” Yang Kai’s lips curled into a subtle smile as he asked.

“Given our current relationship, and the fact that you could kill me at any time, plus the color and fragrance of this pill, it shouldn’t be a Poison Pill or anything harmful to me—there’s no reason for you to do that. So, this Spiritual Pill must be very useful to me, right?” Hua Qingsi didn’t answer immediately, but instead analyzed the situation carefully. “I’m already at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, just a step away from the Emperor Realm. There aren’t many pills in this world that could help me much. Besides… I’ve never seen or even heard of the kind of pill you’re holding…”

As she spoke, Hua Qingsi’s eyes grew brighter. “The only explanation is that this pill is one of those legendary items…” She suddenly cried out, unable to contain herself, “I want it, I want it! Give it to me!”

But Yang Kai didn’t hand it over right away. Instead, he looked at her teasingly and clicked his tongue, “Is it really okay for a woman to say something like that?”

“Go die!” Hua Qingsi’s face flushed from his teasing, and she glared at Yang Kai through gritted teeth. “Are you giving it or not?”

Yang Kai smiled and stopped teasing her, tossing the Spiritual Pill over.

Hua Qingsi caught it happily, first examining it closely in front of her eyes, but she couldn’t see anything special. Then she sniffed it and even gave it a gentle lick.

“Is that really necessary…” Yang Kai’s face darkened. “Why not just eat it?”

“What kind of Spiritual Pill is this?” Hua Qingsi asked, looking up.

“Supreme Mystic Pill!”

At these words, Hua Qingsi froze. Her beautiful eyes trembled violently as she stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“You know it?” Yang Kai looked at her in mild surprise.

After all, back in the Four Seasons Land, many cultivators didn’t even know about the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus or the Supreme Mystic Pill. It was only thanks to Lan Xun’s explanation that everyone realized how precious they were.

But Hua Qingsi’s reaction made it clear she recognized it.

“How could I not know…” Hua Qingsi replied as if it were obvious, her voice trembling slightly. “This is the famous… Supreme Mystic Pill! There might not be a single one in a thousand or ten thousand years!”

She wasn’t exaggerating.

While the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus might appear every so often, the Supreme Mystic Pill was extremely hard to come by. If the Treasure Lotus wasn’t consumed or refined into a pill within three hours of maturing, its medicinal power would dissipate.

Two conditions were needed for a Supreme Mystic Pill to be born.

The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus must appear!

And at the same time, a highly skilled Alchemist must be nearby!

For both conditions to be met was almost a once-in-a-million-years event. Even then, the Alchemist had to perform perfectly or even beyond their limits—otherwise, if the refinement failed, everything would be lost.

There had been cases in history where Alchemists, under too much pressure while refining the Supreme Mystic Pill, failed and destroyed both the pill and the furnace.

This shows just how rare and precious the Supreme Mystic Pill is.

“You really do know your stuff.” Yang Kai grinned.

“Where did you get it? Did the Time Temple have something like this?” Hua Qingsi was still in shock, unable to calm down.

“I made it myself,” Yang Kai replied.

“You’re an Alchemist too?” Hua Qingsi’s expression turned odd.

"Is that a problem?" Yang Kai retorted, a little annoyed. "Stop holding it and just eat it. You’re at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm now—if you take it, you might reach the Emperor Realm before long."

“You’re really giving this to me?” Hua Qingsi asked, but her hand clutched the Supreme Mystic Pill tightly.

“Why would I take it out if I wasn’t giving it to you?” Yang Kai chuckled, then explained, “Look, even though you handed over your Soul Brand and formed a relationship with me you’re not happy about, I’m not afraid you’ll betray me or reveal my secrets. Besides, the stronger you are, the more useful you are to me. I really do hope you can reach the Emperor Realm soon. Then I can take you all over the world, and if anyone annoys me, I’ll let you out to bite them.”

“Am I a dog to you…” At first, Hua Qingsi looked touched and grateful, but the more she listened, the colder her face became, as if a layer of frost had settled over it.

“Enough nonsense, hurry up and take it!” Yang Kai snorted.

“I finally get it!” Hua Qingsi shot him a sidelong glance and sneered, “You’re all sharp tongue and soft heart. You want to show kindness, but you’re embarrassed, afraid it’ll shake your authority, so you have to say such vicious things.”

“Do you believe I’ll strip you naked and throw you out?” Yang Kai threatened fiercely, sounding both angry and embarrassed.

“Go ahead!” A blush appeared on Hua Qingsi’s face, but she stuck out her chest and challenged him, “If you really dare, I’ll tell the whole world I’m your woman. Let’s see if you can handle the consequences!”

“So ruthless?” Yang Kai was shocked.

“Hmph!” Hua Qingsi sneered. “If you’re scared, just call me ‘Elder Sister’ and maybe I’ll mercifully let you off!”

“You win!” Yang Kai snapped, gritting his teeth. With a flicker, he left the Small Xuan Realm.

If he kept tangling with this crazy woman, he feared he’d be overwhelmed.

“Don’t go! I’m not finished talking!” Hua Qingsi called out, but there was no response.

After a while, she pursed her red lips, looked at the Supreme Mystic Pill in her hand, and muttered to herself, “So, if I hadn’t glimpsed a bit of his secret back then, I wouldn’t have ended up like this… But if I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have gotten this Supreme Mystic Pill. Blessings and misfortunes truly go hand in hand. Well, for this pill, what’s a hundred years of being locked up by him?”

As she spoke, a faint smile appeared on her face.

Although she was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, she had no confidence in breaking through to the Emperor Realm. Her cultivation had always advanced steadily, step by step, through time and effort.

But as for how to break through that barrier and glimpse the mysteries of the Emperor Realm, she had never found the answer. Back in the Star God Palace, she had tried to consult the experts there, but no one could give her a satisfactory answer or point her to a clear path.

She secretly felt that, without some extraordinary opportunity, she would never touch the mysteries of the Emperor Realm in this lifetime.

And now, that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was suddenly right in front of her.

How could Hua Qingsi not be excited?

The reason she knew about the Supreme Mystic Pill was precisely because, with no hope of advancing to the Emperor Realm, she had researched the Star God Palace’s records to see if there were any miraculous pills that could help her.

And every record mentioned the Supreme Mystic Pill!

The records said it was a pill that led straight to the Emperor Realm. As long as one’s aptitude wasn’t too poor and comprehension not too low, with time, anyone who took it could reach the Emperor Realm.

And among those who reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, who didn’t have enough aptitude? It was just a matter of time.

For people like Xia Sheng and Wuchang, after taking it, they might reach the Emperor Realm in three or five years. Those with lesser aptitude might take ten or twenty years… but even a hundred years, so what?

As long as one could reach the Emperor Realm, any amount of waiting was worth it.

This was truly a gift from the heavens.

Hua Qingsi thought her relationship with Yang Kai was just a forced master-servant bond through the Soul Brand, but she never expected he would give her such a pill.

His generosity and broad-mindedness really surprised her.

Lost in thought, Hua Qingsi no longer hesitated and popped the Supreme Mystic Pill into her mouth.

Since she knew about the Supreme Mystic Pill, she also knew it was best to take it as soon as possible.

As soon as the pill entered her stomach, she sat down cross-legged and began circulating her cultivation technique to absorb its effects.

Meanwhile, in a side room of the palace on Feiyan Peak, Yang Kai appeared in a sorry state, cursing under his breath and looking rather frustrated.

In truth, the batch of Supreme Mystic Pills he refined hadn’t produced just four, as he’d told others, but five!

When the pill calamity struck, Liu Yan had wrapped up the Supreme Mystic Pills and hidden in the Small Xuan Realm, taking all the pills with her. After the calamity passed and while everyone was still in shock, Yang Kai quietly put four of them back so no one was the wiser.
