## Chapter 851 — Are You Blind?

Yang Kai's spirit formation inside the pill furnace seemed to have transformed into an entirely different pattern in an instant.

Moreover, no one had seen any sign that he had made a move.

When carving a spirit formation into a pill furnace, one must let True Yuan pour into the furnace and be controlled with extreme care—using True Yuan as ink and the furnace as paper—only then can the formation be inscribed.

But just now, Yang Kai's True Yuan had clearly not surged into the furnace.

So where did the spirit formation come from?

"He used Divine Sense!" Du Wan's eyes glittered as he said in a low voice.

"Are you kidding..." He Feng sneered, shaking his head. "Divine Sense, when strong enough, can indeed map out spirit formations, but it can absolutely not be used in pill refinement—if you tried, you'd only ruin those precious materials."

"Watch!" Du Wan said, radiant, offering no further explanation.

Among those present, only he knew that Yang Kai's Divine Sense was unusual—he possessed the power of Divine Sense Fire.

It was the same kind of asset Tianzang Elder had.

Spirit formations constructed with ordinary Divine Sense could not be used for alchemy, but those formed with Divine Sense Fire were different: not only could they be used, but when employed skillfully they could even be more effective than True Yuan.

Everyone held their breath and watched with tense attention.

Seeing Yang Kai, without a hint of hesitation, pour the condensed liquids of each ingredient into the furnace, they all felt their hearts rise into their throats.

They were afraid he might waste the materials.

Unexpectedly, after the liquids entered the furnace there was no sign of failure; the different elixirs mixed and fused, producing strange reactive changes, and a succession of fragrances began to waft from the furnace.

The several masters were bewildered, uncertain what hidden mystery lay within.

Yang Kai's face, however, was utterly focused. His hands moved as True Yuan surged intermittently—sometimes more, sometimes less—his control of the tempering perfect to the extreme, neither overapplication nor underapplication diminishing the ingredients' efficacy.

Everyone once again felt their eyes light up.

After a short while, there was a light popping sound from the furnace.

The spirit formation Yang Kai had been using was destroyed again, and the masters who had just relaxed tightened with apprehension.

Light flickered inside the furnace once more, and a third spirit formation took shape.

He Feng's eyes widened; he no longer knew what to say.

They did change formations during refinement to aid a pill's formation, but not with the recklessness Yang Kai displayed, nor at such a rapid rate.

Faintly, they felt that Yang Kai was using not only True Yuan but also Divine Sense power while refining.

A two-pronged approach.

That kid's Divine Sense power seemed a little... odd!

Yang Kai's cultivation and realm at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm were higher than several of the masters', so even if they suspected something, they could not discover the secret of Divine Sense Fire and naturally remained puzzled.

Crackle, crackle...

Almost every half incense period the spirit formation in the furnace was replaced; the masters could not fathom how he accomplished this—switching formations so frequently in alchemy was a perilous gambit.

As time passed, the hall filled with a rich, heady elixir fragrance, even more aromatic and distinguished than when the masters had refined theirs.

"It's only been two hours..." Chang Bao's fat body trembled as he spoke, astonished.

The spreading aroma meant the pill was nearly complete, and from start to finish Yang Kai had only spent two hours.

Compared to the four hours the masters had taken to refine a Saint Pill, the time was nearly halved.

"Is this kid really refining a Saint Pill?" Hong Fang frowned. "Surely he isn't using Saint-grade materials to make a Spirit-grade pill?"

At his suggestion, the masters thought it quite possible.

Using higher-grade materials to craft a lower-grade pill was common—many insecure alchemists did so to guarantee success.

At this moment, everyone suspected Yang Kai might be doing just that.

After all, two hours was very short; for a Spirit-Grade Pill, someone of Yang Kai's age could manage it.

"You scared this old man to death," He Feng exhaled dramatically. "I truly thought I'd be surpassed by a junior—nearly lost my confidence."

Chang Bao chuckled: "Still, his performance has been very impressive... Hey, Du Wan, bring this kid to my Shining City; I promise I'll treat him well."

Du Wan was unmoved, staring at Yang Kai without blinking.

He felt Yang Kai's character wouldn't violate the alchemical way, and besides, years ago Yang Kai had already been an Upper-Level Spirit-Grade alchemist; if he were really refining a Spirit-Grade Pill there'd be no need to use Saint-grade materials.

What exactly was he refining? Soon they would know. Even the usually composed Du Wan couldn't help feeling some nervousness.

The elixir aroma deepened— the pill was about to be finished.

At that moment Yang Kai's hands moved with an inconceivable speed, golden True Yuan flowing visibly over his fingertips as he drew graceful arcs in the air; those arcs connected into one another, and one by one intricate spirit formation diagrams flashed into being in the void.

Everyone's eyes widened as they watched intently.

One exquisite formation after another was impressed into the furnace and vanished inside.

The little furnace suddenly rang with violent clamor; the forming pill seemed to take on life, ready to leap skyward, the furnace itself trembling.

Heaven-and-Earth Energy went wildly awry, and from around the workshop a tide of energy surged in, pouring into the furnace.

In that instant Yang Kai's small furnace became a bottomless abyss, absorbing the surrounding Spiritual Qi.

Sensing this, everyone's faces changed; none could say what sort of change had occurred.

In a matter of a dozen breaths all returned to calm.

Yang Kai clapped once, and a pill brimming with Spiritual Qi shot out of the furnace. He caught it, placed it into the prepared jade bottle.

Exhaling softly, Yang Kai did not look at the pill; he closed his eyes to contemplate the insights gained from this refinement.

He also took the moment to recover some of his expended energy.

There was a hush; the masters looked at one another, hesitating.

The pill sat in the jade bottle; they could not tell its exact grade, but the earlier commotion made them feel that Yang Kai's creation was no ordinary pill.

After a long while, Yang Kai showed no sign of opening his eyes. Impatient, Chang Bao urged, "Du Wan, go fetch that jade bottle."

"Yes—I want to see whether it's a Spirit-Grade Pill or a Saint-Grade Pill!" Hong Fang egged him on.

After all, Yang Kai belonged to the Giant Stone City Alchemists' Association, so it was proper for Du Wan to act.

Everyone agreed, and Du Wan—appearing helpless—nodded. "Very well."

He stepped forward, took the jade bottle, and the group clustered into a ring, eyes burning with anticipation.

"Open it—how can I inspect it otherwise?" He Feng demanded eagerly.

Du Wan smiled wryly and lifted the bottle's lid. In an instant a fragrance rushed forth that made his expression change.

From the aroma alone, Du Wan could be sure the pill Yang Kai had refined was without doubt a Saint Pill!

He was astonished that Yang Kai had already grown to such a level.

He Feng snatched the bottle, glanced inside, and exclaimed, "Truly a Saint-Grade pill?"

Chang Bao hurried to take it and, upon confirming the pill's quality, his fat body trembled—he could hardly believe it.

The jade bottle passed from master to master until it reached Kong Ruoyu's hands.

Kong Ruoyu studied it, then her eyes grew solemn; after a long examination she said in a trembling voice, "You old fellows—are your eyes blind?"

"What? Isn't this a Saint-Grade pill?" Chang Bao stared at her in astonishment.

"Yes, it's definitely a Saint Pill—Senior Sister Kong, what do you mean by that?" He Feng frowned.

Kong Ruoyu smiled oddly and handed the bottle back. "Look again carefully. This is not merely a Saint-Grade pill."

Hearing her seriousness, they crowded closer once more.

By observation, the aroma, the pill's quality, and the condensation of efficacy all met the standards of a Saint Pill.

Suddenly the Saint Pill shimmered with resplendent lights; to the eye the lights formed meridian-like patterns imprinted on the pill, appearing and disappearing.

Along those meridian-like lines flowed threads of essence; if one listened closely, the pill seemed to contain the sound of running water—wondrous beyond belief.

"Pill Patterns?" they all cried in unison.

"Heh— a Saint Pill sprouting Pill Patterns! Right under my nose; I've broadened my horizons," Kong Ruoyu's voice trembled, part unwilling, part delighted.

The others were struck dumb with shock.

That Yang Kai could produce a Saint Pill alone was enough to stun them; now the pill even bore Pill Patterns.

This was something the masters had pursued for countless years without success.

They had refined many Saint-Grade pills, but none had ever produced Pill Patterns.

A pill that developed Pill Patterns would have its value multiplied several times over; its efficacy would be multiple times that of an ordinary pill, and crucially, it could be preserved permanently.

So long as it remained intact, no matter how many years passed, the pill's effects would not diminish!

That was the real worth of Pill Patterns.

Ordinary pills did not possess such an advantage; however well preserved, their effects constantly faded.

Therefore, the sooner a pill is taken after being refined, the better its effect.
