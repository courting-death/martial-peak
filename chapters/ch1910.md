## Chapter 1910 — Pill Completion

On the ninth level of the Medicine Master Hall the Purple Void Cauldron swirled with violet qi; its lid was tightly shut, and no one could tell what changes lay within — there was not even the faintest sound.

The more than five hundred alchemists gradually withdrew their gazes.

They could see nothing from Yang Kai's side, so they once again focused their attention on Zuo De.

Opportunities to observe, at such close range, a Void King-Grade alchemical grandmaster refining a pill were rare; if one failed to seize it, one would regret it for a lifetime.

Besides, word had it Master Zuo De was always proud and aloof; under normal circumstances these alchemists, even if they personally visited, probably would not get to see Zuo De. Being able to observe him refine a pill now was thanks to Yang Kai.

Thinking that, many quietly felt a little gratitude toward Yang Kai, although some also felt a touch of pity for him.

Because even if he had Divine Sense Fire, in the art of pillcraft he could not possibly surpass a veteran Void King-Grade alchemist.

Time passed slowly; the atmosphere on the ninth level of the Medicine Master Hall was solemn and tense.

At first the alchemists still frequently marveled at Zuo De's astonishing moves and discussed them, but as time wore on everyone fell silent; all attention and spirit were fixed on the cauldron before Zuo De, and on Zuo De himself.

Many alchemists experienced sudden comprehension—clearly they had gained something—but they had no time to meditate on it then and suppressed those thoughts to recall later.

A medicinal fragrance gradually drifted out; it had originated from Zuo De's cauldron.

The scent was delicate and pleasant, as if an invisible hand were stroking each alchemist, causing them to wear expressions of sweet contentment.

Zhan Yuan was the most excited; watching the stirrings inside Zuo De's cauldron, he kept sneaking glances at Yang Kai with a mocking smile at the corner of his mouth and an expression of certain victory.

He had noticed that since Yang Kai ignited his Divine Sense Fire there had been no further unusual movements over there, as if nothing at all were being refined.

This made him even more complacent.

He imagined that if Yang Kai lost he would become Zuo De's slave; as Zuo De's disciple his status would naturally be higher than a slave, and living together with Yang Kai later would allow him to order Yang Kai about at will.

Yes — the man was at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. Best to give him a little face; if provoked into a shame-fueled rage, he might truly prove unbeatable, and he’d likely not be able to take him.

He decided he might as well make him clean his room every day, and since the man seemed to have some pillcraft foundation he could be put to work as an assistant.

With that pleasant decision made, Zhan Yuan pictured his bright future and felt happier than if he had married a peerless beauty, itching to leap about to vent his excitement.

Time slipped by, and in the blink of an eye two days had passed.

Zuo De looked a mess; sweat flowed heavily from his body and the high heat had evaporated it, leaving him appearing utterly disheveled.

Yet no one despised him.

Zuo De was only an Origin Returning Realm cultivator and was advanced in years; sustaining two days of uninterrupted pill refinement would be unbearable for most.

Although his appearance was shabby, his spirit was vigorous and high, and flashes of keen light burst from his eyes.

On Yang Kai's side nothing remarkable had occurred; only the violet vapors in the Purple Void Cauldron steamed and wrapped about.

At a certain moment Zuo De's body trembled, and his hands suddenly began to rapidly perform intricate hand seals.

Everyone gasped in unison.

"The master's self-created Pill-Gathering Technique!"

"Is this the famed Red Lotus Miraculous-Hand Technique? It truly lives up to its reputation! Compared to the pill-gathering techniques of past ages it is in no way inferior, perhaps even superior."

"I once studied this set of moves, but compared to the master I am not even one ten-thousandth as skilled!"

"This Pill-Gathering Technique is the master's original creation—how can you compare yourself to him!"

The group of alchemists immediately sharpened their focus; every eye was fixed on Zuo De's movements, unwilling to miss any detail—if they could divine the profundity of this Pill-Gathering Technique from this performance, the gain would be enormous.

Zuo De's hands fluttered like butterflies as palms struck the cauldron; with each palm a red-lotus imprint appeared and then shattered, sinking into the cauldron to interact wondrously with the spiritual pill forming inside.

This was precisely Zuo De's self-created Red Lotus Miraculous-Hand Technique!

Zuo De struck in succession eighty-one times; eighty-one red-lotus imprints were driven into the cauldron.

When the final palm landed, a crisp, tinkling sound suddenly issued from the cauldron, and at the same moment the lingering medicinal fragrance grew markedly richer.

"Pill formed!" someone cried out, eyes burning with fervor.

Every alchemist present was intimately familiar with the scene—it was clearly a sign the pill had formed, and judging by the sound and the aroma, Master Zuo De's refinement was an utter success.

No wonder he was a master: he had produced a Void King-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pill in only two days. Across the Star Domain among Void King-Grade alchemists, Zuo De stood at the very top.

Suddenly Zuo De's expression turned grave; he struck his cauldron hard, the lid flew off, and at the same time a pale blue light shot out from the cauldron with incredible speed.

Zuo De had prepared for this—he reached out, stilled the pale blue light in midair, then with another motion gathered it and tossed it into a jade vial ready in his other hand.

A soft tinkling sound followed.

The sound riveted everyone's eyes wide.

Zuo De rose to his full height and laughed loudly; though exhausted, his face glowed with health.

"Congratulations, Master, congratulations! To have refined such a perfect Spiritual Pill today, your promotion to Void King-Grade Middle-Level must be just around the corner."

"Indeed, the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill is a Void King-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pill. Even if a peer of the same rank attempted it, they might not do so with such ease; the master already displays Middle-Level calibre."

"Master is truly our exemplar; we are unworthy to compare!"

The alchemists clamored—some flattering, some sincere in their congratulations, voices in a jumble.

Zuo De wore a smile as he held the jade vial containing the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill and cupped his fist: "You fellows flatter this old man; I only took the lead to scout the way. You are all elites in the alchemical world—your future attainments may not be worse than mine."

Perhaps because this refinement had gone unexpectedly smoothly, Zuo De's mood was very good and his manner most genial.

"Master, may this disciple be so fortunate as to see the spiritual pill?" Zhan Yuan, adept at flattery, naturally knew what to say.

"Take it!" Zuo De tossed the jade vial to Zhan Yuan without hesitation. Zhan Yuan feigned awe, accepted it with exaggerated care, peered through the jade at the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, and exclaimed, "Master, you truly are formidable. This spiritual pill is translucent and plump, its medicinal potency condensed—by quality alone it may well be Upper-Level. With just a bit more refinement, it might even manifest Pill Patterns!"

Some alchemists' expressions turned awkward, knowing the flattery had gone too far.

Producing a Void King-Grade spiritual pill was already extraordinary—yet to hope for Pill Patterns as well was excessive.

In the entire Star Domain, over the tens of thousands of years, it seemed nobody had managed to refine a Void King-Grade spiritual pill bearing Pill Patterns.

Though they thought this, no one voiced it.

One by one they gazed at the jade vial in Zhan Yuan's hands. Zhan Yuan knew their thoughts and, after obtaining Zuo De's consent, passed the jade vial to another alchemist for inspection.

As the vial circulated through each alchemist's hands, each broke into exclamations of admiration.

Zuo De basked in pride, appearing as if he had grown a few hundred years younger.

"Grandfather, your spiritual pill is finished—what about that man?" Zuo Ling suddenly asked.

"Go look and you'll know," Zuo De said with a faint smile.

Zhan Yuan clapped and laughed: "Master, you may not be aware—these past two days I have also observed that man. I thought that since he possessed Divine Sense Fire his pillcraft would be transcendent, but alas..."

"Alas what?" Zuo De asked.

"Alas that he only has Divine Sense Fire!" Zhan Yuan laughed loudly.

Zuo De smiled faintly and chided him: "Do not underestimate others. Divine Sense Fire has effects on us alchemists that are hard to imagine. He does not appear entirely ignorant—perhaps he truly is an alchemist."

"Master's teaching is well taken, but even if he is an alchemist, he is still far inferior to you," Zhan Yuan said.

Zuo De laughed with pride and waved his hand: "We'll see—young people today..."

At that they, led by Zuo De, came over to Yang Kai's vicinity.

"Congratulations, Master." As host, Chairman Ai Ou had stood by Yang Kai's side, but since Zuo De had come he could not fail to pay respects, and he had heard from the earlier murmurs that Zuo De had completed the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill.

His emotions were complicated.

On one hand, with the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill completed, Madam Gu would surely be saved, which pleased him greatly.

On the other hand, that pill had been won by Yang Kai with two thousand years of his freedom as the wager; if Yang Kai lost, Ai Ou would feel uneasy.

Thus Ai Ou did not know whether to be happy or worried; deep down he could only pray for a miracle and that Yang Kai would also successfully refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill.

"You should be the one we congratulate, Chairman Ai Ou," Zuo De said with a slight smile as he reached out. Zhan Yuan hurriedly offered the jade vial with both hands. Zuo De took it and handed it to Ai Ou: "The Taichu Soul-Returning Pill is complete; Madam Gu will certainly be well!"

Ai Ou forced a smile: "Thank you, Master, for your noble action."

"It is my duty. This old man is a Guest Elder of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, and Madam Gu is Chairman Ai Ou's lawful wife. Since Madam Gu is in peril, this old man naturally could not stand idly by!" Zuo De said solemnly.

Ai Ou nearly burst out cursing under his breath.

That old bastard has the nerve to say that to me now — where was his conscience before? He even used Xue Yue's marriage to coerce me.

Simply shameless.
