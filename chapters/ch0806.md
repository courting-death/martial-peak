## Chapter 806 — Beast Sea Thicket

Under a large tree ahead, the young man who had come out from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had somehow arrived behind them; he stood there with a teasing smile, looking at them with a mocking expression.

Everyone treated him as a mortal threat, condensing True Yuan and regarding Yang Kai with wary, apprehensive eyes.

Even this ghostly method of appearing and disappearing revealed Yang Kai's extraordinariness; those with some discernment naturally understood he was not to be trifled with.

Especially the leading Transcendent Realm cultivator — he sent out a nearby probe of Divine Sense toward Yang Kai, but it sank like a stone into the sea. The probing sense was utterly swallowed with no return, leaving him horrified.

"I'll stall him a while; you all scatter!" the Transcendent Realm cultivator quietly instructed the others.

Yang Kai chuckled, ignored him, and stepped forward toward them.

As he neared, a tremendous pressure descended as if a mountain had collapsed or an avalanche struck, utterly overwhelming and impossible to resist.

Those Divine Roaming Realm warriors even felt an urge to prostrate and kneel; under that pressure they seemed certain they'd be crushed to powder, their bones obliterated.

"Go!" the Transcendent Realm shouted, forcing his True Yuan into motion and leaping into the air.

"You think you can leave?" Yang Kai snorted coldly. A slice of Divine Sense turned into a razor attack and tore into the man's mind, instantly ripping through the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness.

The jade pendant the man wore flashed and, with a crisp crack, exploded into dust.

That pendant was a Secret Treasure for soul defense, capable of actively guarding against Divine Sense attacks; its grade was not low — a middle Mystery-Grade.

Even so, under Yang Kai's Divine Sense strike the treasure was thoroughly ruined.

The man shot up and crashed heavily to the ground; the radiance in his eyes vanished. The First Stage Transcendent Realm warrior clutched his head, rolled on the ground, and emitted a pitiful wail that chilled those who heard it.

Only then did the square-faced youth realize how vast the gap was between Yang Kai and himself; he now understood the elder had not exaggerated.

No one knew what trick had been used to leave a First Stage Transcendent in that state — how profound must his cultivation be?

The wailing lasted less than ten breaths before weakening; the Transcendent's body stiffened and lay motionless, all vital energy gone.

Dead!

The remaining dozen or so Divine Roaming Realm all trembled, their teeth chattering as they stared at Yang Kai in terror, utterly at a loss.

Yang Kai cast them a cool glance; under his stare each person could not help but avert their eyes.

A dozen Divine Roaming Realm... Yang Kai let out a rueful laugh. Back in Zhongdu that lineup might have been formidable, but years later he could look down on them from above.

He regarded them like ants.

"I'll ask you some questions. Who will answer?" Yang Kai suddenly said.

All of them were seized with terror, certain they would be dead in the next instant; at his words, not one of them responded. Only the square-faced youth, being quick-witted, hastily said, "Me!"

Yang Kai glanced at him and nodded faintly. "Tell me, where are you stationed?"

"In a mountain hollow fifty li from your sect!" the youth hurriedly replied, fearing Yang Kai's displeasure.

"How many people?"

"At least three thousand…"

"Not a small number. Any Saint Realm among them?" Yang Kai probed. Three thousand is fewer than the Sacred Land's disciples, but wars are decided by experts: if the experts win, the battle is won; if they lose, defeat follows.

Those below Transcendent to Saint, no matter how many, are not worth consideration.

"Liu Gui, if you leak intelligence to the enemy, don't expect to keep your head when you return!" someone among them snapped, finally coming to his senses.

Others voiced their displeasure, glaring at the youth named Liu Gui with contempt.

Liu Gui's face flushed; he stammered and dared not continue, looking at Yang Kai with timorous worry.

Yang Kai gave a slight sinister smile and nodded. "Rest assured, I promise no one will know you told me, so you may as well say more."

Saying that, he waved his hand and the Divine Roaming Realm warriors froze stiff where they stood, unable to move or speak, sweating and trembling.

Comforted by Yang Kai's assurance, Liu Gui proceeded to relay everything he knew, point by point.

The more Yang Kai heard, the grimmer his expression grew.

This time the Nine Heavens Sacred Land truly faced a grave disaster.

Poxuan Prefecture, the War Soul Hall, and the Youming Sect had taken advantage of the Sacred Land's internal and external troubles. They not only drew in their own allies but, stirred by the chaos caused by Saintess Nan, had incited dozens of forces to come punish the Sacred Land.

Those dozen forces were not especially powerful; each had at most one Saint Realm expert, and some had none.

Counting the three sects' six Saint Realm figures, the total came to roughly a dozen.

In sheer numbers they outnumbered the Sacred Land two to one, and Transcendent cultivators were plentiful among them.

If a battle erupted, the Sacred Land had no hope; even with formations and barriers they could only hold them off briefly.

As Xu Hui said, those three sects, having chosen to offend the Sacred Land, had prepared thoroughly and would not allow the Sacred Land a chance to recover.

Their inaction until now was because they had publicized threats half a month ago and were waiting for reinforcements.

In about ten days they would launch a major assault, aiming to uproot the age-old Sacred Land and seize the Nine Peaks' Spiritual Qi and resources.

Apart from the three sects, the other forces were mostly gathered due to Saintess Nan's affair; they held no prior grudge against the Sacred Land.

Liu Gui, despite his square face, proved clever and clearly recounted the intelligence under the hostile gazes of his companions.

After listening, Yang Kai already had a plan forming in his mind.

He gave a slight nod of approval and, with exaggerated warmth, patted Liu Gui's shoulder. "This young man has potential — live well."

"Yes… thank you for the praise," Liu Gui replied awkwardly. Suddenly his expression shifted as he eyed Yang Kai suspiciously.

For a moment he felt something lacking in his Sea of Consciousness, but careful inspection revealed nothing.

Yang Kai chuckled. "For safety's sake, I'll hold on to your soul imprint for now. When you return, don't leak any word about me; otherwise, even across ten thousand li, I can easily put you to death."

Liu Gui went pale and involuntarily stepped back. "Soul imprint?"

"Yes. And don't think of running — I can sense your location at any time. If you dare to act treacherously, you know the consequences."

"Understood, understood!" Liu Gui kept nodding; though he did not know what trick Yang Kai had used, he felt his fate was now in another's hands.

"Very well, I'll be off then!" Yang Kai grinned, shifted his figure, and vanished from Liu Gui's sight.

Liu Gui hesitated, pointing at the motionless companions, and cried, "What about them?"

He received no response.

Liu Gui's face twisted with sudden change.

Shortly after, as Yang Kai sped toward the yao territory, he faintly heard doleful screams and dying curses — Liu Gui must have taken action against those Divine Roaming Realm cultivators.

That boy was no good; Yang Kai could tell at a glance he was of petty, thieving nature. To safeguard the secret he'd naturally kill to silence them, a truly despicable and shameless sort.

Yet Yang Kai needed a pawn inside the enemy ranks to spy on them; a coward who loved life was precisely the sort to use.

How Liu Gui would explain his actions afterward was his own concern.

Swift as lightning, following Xu Hui's directions, Yang Kai flew onward.

After crossing that ten-thousand zhang mountain, Yang Kai soon felt himself entering a place rather different from before.

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy in the air carried an odd quality.

As in the Demon Domain, the Heaven-and-Earth Energy was mixed with faint demonic qi; the Yao Realm here likewise carried a trace of yao qi.

Whether demonic qi or yao qi, both are merely different forms of Heaven-and-Earth Energy, slightly altered by the long-term inhabitants of the place.

Beyond the ten-thousand zhang mountain lay a dense forest.

The Beast Sea Thicket — the yao's territory.

Towering trees, each so thick that several people together could barely encircle them, blocked out the sunlight above.

No sooner had Yang Kai entered than he sensed a nearby demonic beast watching him. Probing with Divine Sense revealed it was only Sixth-Tier, so he paid it little mind and continued forward, hoping to find a beast or yao to converse with.

But quickly Yang Kai noticed this beast was not like those he'd met before.

It trailed at his side with an air of intelligence, watching him as if possessed of reason, yet it refrained from launching an attack.

Wherever it passed it seemed to have contacted other beasts; as Yang Kai went deeper, more beasts gathered at his flank.

They displayed organization and discipline, evidently possessing a measure of spirit-intelligence, though not high.

Sensing this, Yang Kai halted and sent out a Divine Sense to attempt communication.

Yang Kai had ample experience in this regard; after days spent communicating with the Divine Tree, he knew how to deal with such low-intelligence creatures.
