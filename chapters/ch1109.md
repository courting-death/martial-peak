## Chapter 1109 — He Came Again

Yang Yan spent an unusually long time on this batch of forging—fully two months.

But on the day she emerged from seclusion, she produced seven Secret Treasures of Saint King-Grade! There were pieces from the upper, middle, and lower tiers.

Perhaps it was thanks to the pills and Saint Crystals Yang Kai had given her that aided her recovery; this time she wasn’t overly exhausted. After handing the Secret Treasures to Yang Kai, she even had the leisure to count how many Saint Crystals she still owed him, laboriously using her fingers and taking it very seriously.

She was serious about forging, plain and straightforward, had a good temper, was pretty, well-shaped, and most importantly, charged very little for her services!

Yang Kai felt he’d struck gold and grew even more determined to keep Yang Yan as his personal artisan.

He casually handed her a few bottles of pills and some Upper-Level Saint Crystals; Yang Yan’s face lit up with delight as she packed the pills and Saint Crystals into her Spatial Ring and asked, "What will you have me forge next? Give me the materials first—I’ll see what ores suit them best."

Yang Kai took out the shell, tail, and a large pincer from a Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion and tossed them in front of Yang Yan.

The girl’s eyes instantly widened, sinister light blooming within them. She crouched and picked the items up one by one, running her small hands over them while murmuring to herself, seemingly lost in thought.

After a long moment she raised her head and asked Yang Kai, "Are you willing to entrust these to me for forging?"

Yang Kai nodded. "You’ve proven your skill. I also believe you truly are an Origin-Grade artificer; of course these should go to you."

"Aren’t you afraid I’ll run off with them?" Yang Yan still sounded dubious. "These are materials from a Ninth-Tier demonic beast—things that can be forged into Origin-Grade Secret Treasures!"

"Try me—see if I can’t fetch you back," Yang Kai grinned.

Yang Yan curled her lip; she disliked Yang Kai’s unfounded confidence. It was as if everything were always under his control—truly exasperating.

“Don’t worry, I’m not someone who goes back on their word. I’ll bring out the full potential of these items you’ve given me. But this time, the ores we’ll need to purchase are different from before—be prepared to bleed your wallet dry!” Yang Yan said, her expression turning serious.

"Fine, write the list up." Yang Kai nodded, then added, "By the way, I have a request."

"Say it."

"Forge that shell into a defensive Secret Treasure for my personal use. Handle the rest as you please."

"Got it. Do you have the Inner Core of that beast? If so, give that to me as well—I’ll need it during forging."

No sooner had Yang Yan finished speaking than he tossed over a fist-sized Inner Core imbued with wind and earth attributes. She accepted it with satisfaction, then set to work writing a list. Before long she handed the list to Yang Kai and urged, "Hurry and go—return quickly. I’ll start forging after a few days’ rest. It’s so good being by your side; there are so many fine materials waiting for me to handle."

She seemed eager beyond restraint.

Tianyun City. In the trading house, Qian Tong sat in a room on the third floor, sipping tea and staring toward the direction Yang Kai had left two months prior, his brows clouded with anxiety and helplessness.

Although he had been certain Yang Kai would return, he hadn’t expected to wait as long as two months.

Even today the youth had not reappeared, which greatly disturbed Qian Tong. He had feared making a bad impression upon the powerful figure behind the youth, so he hadn’t sent anyone to tail him nor dared to pry—only hoping to learn more gradually and thereby draw that powerful figure out.

In hindsight that might have been a mistake; at the very least he should have informed the youth that he wished to recruit the person behind him; if the youth were clever, he would carry the message.

If that powerful person were willing, they would naturally come to Yingyue Hall; if not, he could invite them later.

Securing such a master sooner would bring benefits to the hall; if delayed, other forces might discover them and then a scramble would break out. If things reached that stage, more than one or two deaths could occur.

As he thought this, Qian Tong grew restless, crushing his teacup without noticing. Only when the scalding tea ran over the back of his hand did he startle awake.

Looking at the ruined table, Qian Tong laughed bitterly.

He was not young, nor an insignificant cultivator; it had been many years since anything had so perturbed him. Even in life-or-death contests with equals he had not felt so powerless.

He picked up the broken cup and wiped the spilled tea dry, took a deep breath, and calmed himself.

A rapid knock sounded at the door. Qian Tong asked irritably, "What is it?"

"Elder Qian, the youth who sold Secret Treasures two months ago has returned," the attendant who had received Yang Kai answered respectfully. After waiting with no response, he heard Qian Tong’s excited shout from within: "Bring him in!"

The next instant he added, "No—no, I will welcome him myself!"

A clatter followed, as if furniture and teapots had been toppled to the floor.

The attendant’s face darkened. He wondered what sort of person could draw such reverence from Elder Qian, causing the room’s furnishings to be overturned.

The door opened and Qian Tong, flush with excitement, hurried downstairs.

The attendant peered in and, as he suspected, saw the room in complete disarray.

On the first floor Yang Kai grew impatient.

Last time the attendant had treated him with exemplary hospitality—almost doting. This time, though he was now a familiar customer bringing Secret Treasures per their arrangement, the attendant had him wait and then vanished.

After a while the rotund elder named Qian Tong hurried over, beaming and laughing: "Ah, young man, I’ve waited two months for you—so glad you’ve come! Please, come in!"

Saying this, he warmly seized Yang Kai’s arm and led him toward the private chamber where they had transacted before.

Warriors trading in the shop were stunned, staring after Yang Kai’s retreating back in speechless surprise.

Many recognized Qian Tong and knew him as a high-ranking elder of Yingyue Hall, yet such a distinguished person treated Yang Kai with such familiarity that onlookers whispered and speculated about Yang Kai’s identity after the two disappeared.

"What’s this fellow’s background that Elder Qian personally receives him and is so enthusiastic? Even the nearby family heads wouldn’t get this treatment, would they?"

"Don’t know—haven’t seen him before, and his clothes don’t match someone of high status."

"His cultivation isn’t high either—only the Third Stage of the Saint Realm."

"Weird. Last time the Kerei family head came personally and discussed business, but Qian Tong didn’t show up."

"Who knows what’s going on."

"..."

Inside the secret chamber Qian Tong courteously seated Yang Kai, had fragrant tea and fruit presented, and, pointing to the golden, spiritually potent fruits on the platter, said with a smile, "These fruits are a specialty of one of Yingyue Hall’s subordinate families. Only the soil of that place on Dark Star suits those trees; they ripen once every ten years and yield fewer than five hundred each harvest. They don’t swiftly increase cultivation, but taste pleasant, clear the heart and essence, and replenish Saint Yuan—ideal for someone like you on the verge of breakthrough. If you don’t mind, try one."

He had seen that Yang Kai stood at the threshold between the Third Stage of the Saint Realm and the Saint King Realm, and assumed Yang Kai would soon attain the Saint King Realm, so offering the fruits was perfectly timed.

Yang Kai glanced at him without pretense or guard, took a fruit and ate it; the fragrance lingered on his lips and he nodded: "Tastes good. If you don’t mind, Elder Qian, I’d like to take some back."

They would help restore Saint Yuan quickly—useful for Yang Yan’s forging.

A gleam flashed in Qian Tong’s eyes and he laughed heartily: "Be my guest—if you like them I’ll have more prepared. It’s just a pity they’re scarce."

He wasn’t bothered that Yang Kai would take some fruits; the act hinted at something that excited him.

Why would Yang Kai take the fruits back?

Obviously to present them to the powerful person behind him!

This confirmed Qian Tong’s earlier suspicion: the youth must indeed have a formidable artificer backing him.

"Elder Qian said he’s been waiting a long time for me—was that for this?" Yang Kai said as he produced the seven freshly forged Secret Treasures from his Spatial Ring.

Qian Tong’s eyes widened with each item Yang Kai revealed, and his breathing grew heavier.

When all seven were displayed Qian Tong’s expression had become almost frenzied.

He was certain Yang Kai had come two months ago to buy ore specifically to forge these treasures, and that in merely two months he had produced seven Saint King-Grade Secret Treasures—proof the master behind him was truly renowned!

Even if Master Gelin were to forge them, producing so many fine Secret Treasures in such a short span would be unlikely.

Taking a deep breath, Qian Tong composed himself and smiled: "While the treasures are impressive, what I’ve truly been waiting for is you. Hmm, what do you go by, young man?"

"Yang Kai."

“This old man is Qian Tong. You’ve likely heard the name. If you don’t mind, this old one will take the liberty of addressing you as nephew—what do you say?”

Yang Kai nodded casually, not taking it to heart. Given Qian Tong’s seniority and age, being called “nephew” was hardly something to feel insulted by.

Qian Tong beamed warmly. “Nephew Yang, so young and already so accomplished—handsome in bearing and nearly at the level of the Saint King Realm. Truly, the younger generation is to be admired…”

As he spoke, he discreetly observed Yang Kai’s reaction.
