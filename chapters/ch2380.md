## Chapter 2380 — Sangde

“Y-You actually crippled my hand!” Yu Leping could not accept the reality that one of his arms had been ruined, and glared at Yang Kai with venomous hatred as he screamed, his face twisted almost beyond recognition from the pain.

“Get lost!” Yang Kai barked fiercely.

For a mere Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to act so arrogantly before him was simply absurd. He had already been in a foul mood these past few days after falling into trouble on Tongtian Island, and now that someone had crossed his path, he naturally vented his anger.

Yu Leping finally seemed to realize that Yang Kai was not some pushover to be toyed with. He shot him a venomous glare, clutched his injured arm, and slunk away in disgrace.

In front of the master’s door, everything was still silent. The other ten people were all shivering, their faces pale.

“Hasn’t the master already opened the door? How much longer do we have to wait?” Yang Kai urged the boy, who was standing there like a fool.

“Come with me, come with me!” The boy shrank his neck, not daring to dawdle, and hurriedly led the way.

Judging by Yang Kai’s explosive temper and ruthless actions just now, the boy figured that if he weren’t under Master Sangde’s tutelage, this guy would probably have struck him too.

After all, when that man was squeezed out of his spot earlier, the boy hadn’t said a word to help him.

Soon, under the boy’s guidance, the group entered the inner hall. The boy pointed to a side door and said, “Go in one by one. The master is inside. You all know the rules, so do as you please.”

After saying this, he quickly ran off and disappeared.

After he left, the first martial artist in line cautiously glanced at Yang Kai, found that Yang Kai had already picked a spot to sit by himself, and realized he had no intention of stealing the first place. Relieved, he hurried into the side door to seek the master’s help with artifact refining.

The other eight who had come to ask Master Sangde for artifact refining also found places to sit, though most kept their distance from Yang Kai out of wariness.

It was as if Yang Kai had claimed one side for himself, while the others crowded together elsewhere.

Yang Kai didn’t care at all and closed his eyes to rest.

“That Yu Leping isn’t just anyone. Senior Brother, you’d best be careful.”

A gentle voice suddenly entered Yang Kai’s ears, carrying a hint of warning.

Yang Kai opened his eyes, swept his gaze around, and fixed it on the elegantly dressed young woman.

Of the ten people here to seek the master’s artifact refining, only two were Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—Yang Kai and this young woman. The rest were First or Second Stage.

Though the woman’s attire was plain, it couldn’t hide her natural beauty. Yang Kai had glanced at her before but hadn’t paid much attention, yet now she was sending him a secret message.

Seeing Yang Kai look her way, the woman simply nodded slightly and then discreetly shifted her gaze away.

In this inner hall, Yang Kai and she had the highest cultivation, and their Divine Sense was the strongest, so communicating like this wouldn’t be noticed by the others. Still, her secretive manner showed she didn’t want to cause trouble for herself.

“Thank you for the warning, Junior Sister. I’ll keep it in mind,” Yang Kai replied.

Seeing his indifferent expression, the young woman spoke again, “Senior Brother, you mustn’t take this lightly. That Yu Leping is backed by the City Lord’s mansion—he’s always been arrogant and domineering in Tongtian City, relying on the City Lord’s protection and never caring about anyone else. Now that you’ve made him suffer such a loss, he definitely won’t let this go.”

“If he wants to die, I don’t mind helping him along.”

Hearing Yang Kai’s casual words, the woman broke out in a cold sweat and hurriedly said, “Absolutely not! If you really kill him, there’ll be no place for you on Tongtian Island.”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “The tree wants to be still, but the wind won’t stop. What can I do?”

The woman sighed softly, knowing Yang Kai was right. Even if he showed mercy and let Yu Leping go today, given Yu Leping’s usual behavior, he wouldn’t swallow his anger. When the time came, Yang Kai would either have to surrender and accept punishment or fight back.

Judging by his demeanor, he wasn’t the type to swallow his anger.

“Thank you, Junior Sister,” Yang Kai said calmly.

Though the woman hadn’t helped him directly, she had given him a quiet warning, which was a kind gesture.

The woman said no more, but whenever she glanced at Yang Kai, her eyes were full of pity and sympathy, as if she could already foresee his tragic fate.

The inner hall remained quiet, with no one chatting. Everyone was anxiously waiting for Master Sangde to refine their artifacts, too impatient to make small talk.

About half an hour later, the first martial artist who had entered the side door suddenly came out. Everyone looked at him, and he wore a look of joy, as if something good had happened. Without saying a word, he left immediately.

The second martial artist quickly stood up and headed for the side door.

And so it went, until evening, when the other nine left one after another. Each had a different expression—some were delighted, some were serious, but none looked troubled.

Observing their reactions, Yang Kai knew that Master Sangde’s reputation was well-deserved. He had successfully refined artifacts for all nine, with not a single failure.

Rumor had it that Master Sangde had glimpsed the secrets of becoming an Imperial-Grade Artifact Refiner, and it seemed true.

Stepping through the side door, Yang Kai found himself enveloped in dimness, the light all but swallowed by the gloom. Yet ahead, a faint glow beckoned from an exit further in. Guided by that sliver of brightness, he made his way forward, and before long, he emerged into a sweltering chamber, the air thick with heat.

Looking around, he saw a secret chamber with flames dancing on all sides. A massive Refining Furnace stood in the center, and beside it sat a figure cross-legged. As the flames flickered, the figure seemed to appear and disappear, eerie and unpredictable.

Though the lighting was poor, Yang Kai could still see Master Sangde’s face clearly at a glance.

To his surprise, the master looked like an ordinary old man, with nothing remarkable about him. Yet Yang Kai could sense that this elder was not to be trifled with—he sat there like a dormant volcano, hiding immense power within his body.

Besides being an exceptional artificer, his own strength was surely formidable.

“Greetings, Master!” Yang Kai cupped his fists.

“Sit,” Sangde said, pointing to a cushion in front of him.

Yang Kai sat down as instructed.

“What do you want refined? Take out your materials and state your requirements,” Sangde said.

Yang Kai quickly produced the set of Purification Array bases and flags, handed them to Sangde, and said, “I’d like to ask Master to repair this set of Formation Foundation flags.”

Sangde took them, examined them carefully for a while, and nodded. “This set was made by me. Repairing it won’t be difficult.”

Yang Kai was delighted. He had suspected that the Purification Array was Sangde’s work, and now it was confirmed.

Since the master could make it, repairing it would be no problem. He said, “I don’t know what materials are needed, so I didn’t prepare anything. If Master has suitable materials, I can buy them. Source Crystals aren’t an issue.”

Sangde slapped the Refining Furnace, and the lid flew off. He tossed all the Formation Foundation flags inside, then looked at Yang Kai and said, “Do I look like someone who lacks Source Crystals?”

Yang Kai didn’t know what he meant by that and was at a loss for words.

“I don’t want Source Crystals!” Sangde continued.

“Then what does Master want?” Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. He thought, you didn’t even ask and already threw my Purification Array into the furnace, then told me you don’t want Source Crystals—are you raising the price on the spot?

What if you ask for something I can’t afford? Will I lose the Purification Array?

If the Purification Array were his own, it wouldn’t matter, but it belonged to Ling Yinqin and held great symbolic meaning for her. Otherwise, Yang Kai would have just bought a new set for her at a high price.

It was because the Purification Array carried Ling Yinqin’s longing for her partner that Yang Kai had gone to such trouble to find Sangde for repairs.

“It depends on what you can offer me,” Sangde said blandly.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel annoyed. If you want my life, am I supposed to give it to you? No wonder the boy’s behavior was questionable—Sangde was the same.

Looks like his name fits him perfectly—'Sangde,' meaning 'lacking virtue'!

He suppressed his irritation and said solemnly, “What does Master want? If I can do it, I’ll do my best.”

In other words, if he couldn’t do it, he wouldn’t force himself.

Sangde smiled slightly, and the smile was rather sinister.

Just as Yang Kai focused his mind, ready to listen, a surge of pure and powerful Divine Soul energy erupted from Sangde, forming a spear that shot straight at Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

Though caught off guard, Yang Kai reacted quickly, mobilizing his Divine Soul power to meet the attack head-on.

Boom...

The silent collision made both Yang Kai and Sangde tremble slightly.

Sangde’s eyes showed surprise, then delight. The previously calm gaze suddenly burst with a terrifying light, staring at Yang Kai as if he’d found a treasure.

Yang Kai, however, sprang to his feet. He hadn’t unleashed his full Divine Sense in the hasty counterattack—not because he couldn’t, but because he was afraid of injuring Sangde. If he seriously wounded the master’s Divine Soul, there’d be no one to repair the Purification Array.

But Sangde’s silent sneak attack infuriated Yang Kai. He secretly decided that if the old man didn’t give him a satisfactory explanation, he’d put a knife to his throat and force him to repair the Purification Array properly.
