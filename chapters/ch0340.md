## Chapter 340 – Seeking Death?

Upon hearing the elder's words, everyone suddenly realized.

It turned out that he had gone to great lengths to lure the Soul Evil Spirit here just to seek Yang Kai's help. If Yang Kai could really step in to assist, he wouldn't have to work so hard to guard the surroundings like he was now.

At that time, they could sit safely on the high platform like Yang Kai and the others, watching from the sidelines.

As long as they could delay until the evil water from the Evil Spring dissipated, they could naturally escape safely.

If it weren't for the elder's concern about the strength of Yang Kai and his companions, he would have long since acted to seize the high platform they occupied, and there would be no need for such trouble.

One had to admit, his plan was indeed clever.

Yu Qing from the Xiaoyao Sect couldn't help but laugh heartily as he watched the situation develop. "Elder, your methods are impressive! I admire you!"

Just a moment ago, the elder had appeared confident and composed, which left Yu Qing somewhat puzzled. However, looking at it now, it was clear that the elder had already devised this plan long ago. Perhaps he had detected the presence of the Soul Evil Spirit, which was why he had encouraged his junior brothers to sacrifice the Meinu, allowing him time to lure the Spirit over.

"Hehe, if you come out into the world without some means, how can you survive? You should learn from this." The elder chuckled sinisterly, while the four young people beside him couldn't stop laughing, seemingly in admiration of the elder's cunning.

The people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect had faces as pale as water, filled with extreme anger, yet they had no way to retaliate.

"My friend, have you considered my offer?" With the situation in his favor, the elder was no longer in a hurry. He had just boasted about how Yang Kai and the others needed to seek his help.

In his view, this group of True Essence Realm cultivators would eventually bow to him, unless they were courting death! Having not cultivated Divine Sense, relying solely on that one Divine Soul Treasure could not possibly withstand the attacks from the Soul Evil Spirit.

It wouldn't take long for their souls to suffer severe wounds, and by that time, the elder could ask for an even higher price. Thus, he did not rush them, merely inquired casually.

Yang Kai frowned at him, letting out a cold hum. He did not respond.

On the high platform, Yu Qing whispered to the elder, "Elder, if they can't hold on and come seeking your help later, could you set another condition?"

The elder raised an eyebrow, "Oh? What condition?"

Yu Qing casually glanced at the Hu sisters, a lewd glint appearing in his eyes. He licked his lips and said, "Have them hand over that pair of twins!"

The elder looked at Yu Qing meaningfully; he knew Xiaoyao Sect's methods of enslaving and training Meinu, which came in different tiers. If the twins were trained as Meinu, their utility for Xiaoyao Sect's male disciples would be even greater, especially since the Hu sisters were quite formidable themselves, making Yu Qing all the more eager.

Xiaoyao Sect pursued them into the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave precisely because they recognized the value of the twin sisters.

"That might be difficult to negotiate." The elder frowned slightly. Although he could coerce Yang Kai and the others, he also needed their help. Making excessive demands would only backfire, and he could end up suffering losses instead.

"I can offer four more Meinu to you, how about that?" Yu Qing suggested softly.

"That could be considered..." The elder nodded in satisfaction. "Here's the deal, once things settle here, I will help you capture all those women over there! You then give me eight Meinu, is that acceptable?"

"Eight is too much. The twins are worth four Meinu, but the other two women... Six Meinu at most, I can't go higher." Yu Qing's face revealed a trace of hidden pain, as if he felt he was taking a major loss.

"Fine, six it is. Remember, you owe me fourteen Meinu!" The elder chuckled sinisterly, clearly in a good mood.

"Of course, I'll remember." Yu Qing was very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations, instinctively flattering the elder. "Elder, you truly are exceptional; it seems you aren’t very fond of women."

If he truly cared about women, he wouldn't have handed over all four ladies on the opposite side.

As for the twin sisters, their stunning beauty went without saying. Leng Shan from Ghost King Valley was exceptional as well, and while the other seemingly innocent girl didn't compare to the other three, she still possessed her own charm.

The elder sneered, "What do women matter? Only young ones like you get obsessed with that. If I wanted women, there isn't a kind I couldn't get!"

"Yes, yes, yes, you're right, elder." Yu Qing nodded repeatedly, not daring to refute him. Before long, the elder seemed much more pleasing to the eye, and looking at the Hu sisters, he couldn’t help but reveal a smug smile, as if he had already captured them for the Xiaoyao Sect, preparing to subject them to all kinds of drugs and soul techniques for training.

With the agreement settled, both the elder and Yu Qing were quite satisfied, and even the four young people accompanying the elder showed expressions of joy.

They knew that after the elder secured fourteen Meinu, he would surely reward each of them with one.

Ah, a Meinu could warm one's bed and, in critical moments, help drain their essence to boost one's cultivation. Who wouldn't want one?

With a Meinu, one would no longer have to feel lonely.

"My friend, let me remind you, if you refuse to cooperate any longer, your friends may find themselves in peril!" The elder casually glanced at Yang Kai and the others, laughing sinisterly.

"Don't waste your breath!" Yang Kai replied coldly.

"Hmph, ungrateful!" The elder's expression turned angry, sneering, "If you don’t plead for my help soon, I definitely won’t step in!" Yang Kai ignored him again, his gaze fixated on the Soul Evil Spirit hovering in midair.

The three members from Baoqi Sect were also tensed, grasping the Five Dragon Seal tightly, preparing for action.

While the elder and Yu Qing negotiated, Yang Kai had also devised a plan to deal with the situation.

"Brother Yang, can you endure this?" Tao Yang expressed some worry, holding the circular Divine Soul Treasure and said, "Why not take this with you?"

"Yes, better safe than sorry." Leng Shan gently advised, her brow creased with concern.

Earlier, when Yang Kai mentioned going out to slay the Soul Evil Spirit, everyone was taken aback, thinking he had gone mad. The Hu sisters were especially panicked and hastily tried to dissuade him.

Hu Mei'er’s eyes brimmed with anxious tears.

"It will be fine; I know my limits, and I will return if it's too much," Yang Kai said with an indifferent expression.

"Just be cautious," Shen Yi said with a serious tone.

Yang Kai nodded.

At that moment, the Soul Evil Spirit opened its mouth once again, about to unleash its soul attack.

"Attack!" Yang Kai shouted loudly.

The three disciples from Baoqi Sect quickly infused their True Essence into the Five Dragon Seal.

The five dragons appeared all at once, and as it began to unleash its soul attack, they spewed forth a white light that pinned the Soul Evil Spirit in place.

Holding the Yang Liquid long sword, Yang Kai shot out like lightning, soaring towards the exploding purple halo.

"Clang…" Tao Yang also activated his Divine Soul Treasure to offset the soul attack hidden within the purple light.

"How fast!" Shen Yi could not help but exclaim in surprise. In the span of a moment, Yang Kai had arrived before the Soul Evil Spirit, his long sword weaving a flawless barrier, continuously slicing at the Spirit's body.

The shrill howls grew progressively harsher as the purple halo exploded in a flurry, yet Tao Yang kept on firing his Divine Soul Treasure, still unable to fend off the overwhelming assault.

His face turned pale, unable to suppress the spurt of fresh blood, his form growing weak.

Shen Yi reacted quickly, grabbing his treasure to shield the others from impending doom.

"Young man, you’re seeking death!" The elder suddenly noticed Yang Kai's audacious actions and could not help but narrow his pupils, barking orders.

He had no intention of caring about Yang Kai’s life; it was just that if Yang Kai died, no one would be left to maintain their protective barrier.

But Yang Kai paid no mind to the elder's shouts, relentlessly attacking the Soul Evil Spirit's body.

In just a brief moment, the purple-hued body of the Soul Evil Spirit dimmed noticeably.

However, its power was evidently much stronger than that of ordinary Purple Evil Spirits. Even though it was restrained by True Yang Primordial Qi, it did not crumble.

"I can't hold on!" Zhao Rong from Baoqi Sect suddenly exclaimed, her face paling the next moment. The Five Dragon Seal in their hands began to dim.

The five dragon figures restraining the Soul Evil Spirit shattered.

Regaining its freedom, the Soul Evil Spirit undoubtedly fell into a complete rage, its features distorting as a burst of purple light shot towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was unable to dodge in time, and the purple light struck deep into his mind.

Intense pain spread from his brain; the Soul Palace was unable to withstand such a targeted soul attack.

The minor culmination of the Soul Palace, which was meant to envelop his mind, was pierced with a gap.

Yang Kai's complexion instantly turned ashen. His movements hesitated for a moment. In that instant, the Soul Evil Spirit lunged towards him with bared fangs and claws.

With a ripping sound, his clothing was torn asunder, and several long wounds appeared on Yang Kai's abdomen, blood gushing forth.

"Brother Yang!" Everyone gasped in horror, their faces filled with dread as they looked at him.

"Seeking death!" the elder sneered coldly, his expression extremely furious. He had hoped Yang Kai would cave in and join forces, yet unexpectedly, this young man was so unyielding, preferring to be shattered than to compromise, causing all his plans to come undone.

Having sustained such a specifically targeted soul attack, with the Soul Evil Spirit's uniqueness, even a Divine Roaming Realm expert would fear for their sanity.

How could Yang Kai, a mere Fifth Stage True Essence Realm cultivator, hope to escape unscathed?

He deserved it! The elder sneered inwardly, feeling no sympathy, just a bit of regret.

If Yang Kai died, he would encounter some trouble himself.

"I'm fine!" Yang Kai suddenly called out, steadying his swaying body and narrowly evading the Soul Evil Spirit's next attack.

A cool sensation lingered in his mind; despite the unbearable pain, the Warm Spirit Lotus once again played its role.

"How can this be?" The elder exclaimed. As a Divine Roaming Realm expert, he could sense the terrifying power contained in that soul technique. Even he dared not take a direct hit, yet how had the young man managed to endure it?

The members of Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief, gazing at Yang Kai with astonished expressions, wondering if he possessed some high-end Divine Soul Treasure, allowing him to defend against it.

However, even if Yang Kai had a Divine Soul Treasure, it surely could only protect him; otherwise, he wouldn't have hesitated to use it earlier.

"One more time!" As Yang Kai danced around, entangled with the Soul Evil Spirit, he yelled to those on the high platform.

"Oh!" Leng Shan quickly responded, dashing over to Zhao Rong to grab the Five Dragon Seal, while the Hu sisters stepped forward together, pouring their True Essence into the Five Dragon Seal.
