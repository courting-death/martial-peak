## Chapter 1655 — One-Shot Kill of the Void King Realm

At this moment, across the entire Chi Lan Star, birds fell from the sky and ferocious beasts cowered on the ground, trembling uncontrollably.

Cities great and small, sect headquarters, and countless families—indeed, a trillion people—all felt a terror rising from the depths of their souls.

It was a horror that bred despair, as if in the next breath one might die.

Regardless of cultivation or age, that trillion people broke out in cold sweat; some collapsed to the ground and could not rise for a long time, as if all their strength had been drained in an instant.

Fortunately, the aura came and left quickly, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Otherwise, Chi Lan Star would have suffered casualties in the tens of millions today!

Above Icebound Island, where the Ice Palace stood, over Yang Kai and Su Yan, a pair of tightly closed eyes suddenly appeared.

At the same time, around Yang Kai and Su Yan there formed an energy layer that neither the naked eye nor Divine Sense could perceive, wrapping them up.

Chi Huo’s Essence-Blood burned, and Luo Hai’s Secret Treasure longsword struck—but every attack was blocked by that energy, not even producing the slightest ripple.

"Impossible!" Luo Hai cried out in shock.

With his Second Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation, the terrifying strike of his Secret Treasure should have wounded Yang Kai, yet it could not harm him in the slightest—and all because of the appearance of a pair of closed eyes.

It was almost unbearable for him to accept.

The existence of the Great Emperor belonged to legend; ordinary people worshipped him like a god. Yet among experts like Luo Hai, many had long sought traces of the Great Emperor, hoping to break the myths and take his place.

In their hearts, the Great Emperor was merely exceptionally powerful—by no means invincible.

Luo Hai had once held the same thought; he believed the Great Emperor was only a top expert at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and thought he would one day stand shoulder to shoulder with him, perhaps even step over him.

But today, he finally understood — the Great Emperor was still an existence far beyond his reach. That was a realm which had absolutely surpassed the Void King Realm, an unknown and terrifying level of power!

He suddenly realized how foolishly arrogant he had been, like that of a frog at the bottom of a well.

That pair of closed eyes showed signs of opening.

Luo Li's face finally changed; she no longer dared linger, her delicate frame shuddering as she bolted away like a frightened rabbit, swiftly distancing herself from the Ice Palace.

The eyes within the void slowly opened — their pupils clear and spotless, carrying no particular sense of majesty. What shocked Luo Hai and Chi Huo most, however, was that these eyes clearly belonged to a woman!

Could the legendary Starry Sky Emperor actually be a woman?

The ridiculous thought surged in the minds of the two Void King Realm experts, leaving them disbelieving.

The beautiful eyes glanced coldly at Luo Hai and Chi Huo with no emotion—as if looking upon two mere ants.

Chi Huo uttered a strangled cry and was flung backward, as if struck hard; he spat blood midair.

His domain field suddenly tore apart.

And the Wei Feng he had been protecting all along suddenly turned into a pile of minced flesh — dying without even a complete corpse.

Even from the depths of Luo Hai’s mind came a series of crisp cracking sounds — the unmistakable sign of his own Domain field collapsing.

It was as if that casual flicker of the beautiful eyes contained an inconceivable supreme might that could not be resisted.

His face turned pale as a trace of blood seeped from the corner of his mouth. His body staggered slightly, yet since his cultivation was far deeper than Chi Huo’s, he still managed to remain standing in place.

The beautiful gaze gave but a passing glance, then disappeared as though it had never appeared at all.

At the same time—

At the same time—

A vast and boundless surge of Imperial Might burst forth from Yang Kai and Su Yan’s bodies. It was a power that did not belong to this mortal world — an existence that could not be gazed upon, a presence before which billions of living beings would bow their heads in reverence.

It was the might of a Great Emperor!

Yang Kai laughed heartily, laughter booming like thunder; contained within his mirth was a strange profound intent that shook Luo Hai's spirit, making his Sea of Consciousness churn and refuse to settle.

Chi Huo, once he steadied himself, grew even paler.

Golden and white qi wrapped Yang Kai and Su Yan; the roar of dragon and cry of phoenix resounded, but those yin-yang energies were markedly different from before.

The earlier yin-yang qi had been powerful enough to threaten ordinary Void King Realm experts, and Luo Hai had not taken it seriously.

Yet now the strength of the golden-white qi had risen to a degree that made even Luo Hai's color change!

It was as if a force from the unsealed Star Emperor Token had poured into Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Gradually, the yin and yang qi fused completely, indistinguishable from one another.

In everyone's view, Yang Kai and Su Yan vanished; in their place hovered only a hazy orb of light.

"Chi Huo, you die first!" Yang Kai's cold command issued from the light orb, which then lunged at Chi Huo.

Chi Huo's face turned ashen; he cried in terror, "Brother Luo Hai, save me!"

At the same time, he swiftly formed a series of seals with both hands, frantically urging his Saint Yuan without regard for his life, erecting before him a defense as solid as an iron wall.

Layer upon layer of Saint Yuan wrapped around him like substance, and a Void King-Grade defensive Secret Treasure took the form of a blazing flame to enclose him.

But all was in vain.

As the glowing sphere drew near, the first thing to shatter was the Void King-Grade defensive artifact that had transformed into flames. This treasure, considered one of the finest in the entire Star Domain, could not withstand the terrifying might of the light sphere at all—upon mere contact, it instantly crumbled apart.

Within the orb, faint silhouettes of a Golden Dragon and an Ice Phoenix emerged, majestic and noble, dancing as if above the heavens in a breathtaking display.

The orb brushed past Chi Huo.

Chi Huo remained standing where he was, motionless, eyes glazed as he stared into the void, his face still wearing the look of utter horror.

"I... I should never have..." Chi Huo began.

Before he could finish, blinding light erupted from his body; as though his flesh had been pierced by countless holes, light sprayed from his pores, making him appear like a glowing hedgehog.

Boom—

A tremendous explosion tore Chi Huo's body asunder, reducing him to a mist of blood that rained upon the ground.

Gasps rose from the sky; the elders of Ice Heart Valley felt the chill in their chests, one after another displaying looks of fear.

This expert of the First Stage of the Void King Realm could not withstand a single strike from Yang Kai and Su Yan wielding the Star Emperor Token; he had been instantaneously slain.

Such combat power—perhaps not even a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert possessed it!

Luo Li trembled; a trace of horror flashed in her eyes, followed by deeper regret.

She could sense Chi Huo's state of mind before death and knew what his unspoken words had meant.

Chi Huo regretted—and how could she be free of that same remorse?

If she had known the situation would unfold like this, how could she have stood aside and minded her own safety?

Had she known, she would have fought to the death to protect Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Luo Li sighed long and low.

Ice Heart Valley is doomed never to rise; a Heaven-bestowed opportunity lay before them, and they had treated it as nothing, pushing it away. What use is regret now?

She only hoped that the young man, for Su Yan's sake, would not wreak great vengeance upon Ice Heart Valley after resolving the present trouble—otherwise the valley would surely be destroyed today.

"Ha—hahaha!" A laugh, bordering on madness, suddenly came from nearby. Luo Li frowned and saw Ran Yunting laughing up at the sky.

Yet that laughter and the expression on her face were filled with endless bitterness and remorse.

From the moment she chose to abandon Su Yan, from the moment Su Yan called her “Master” for the last time, it was already destined that she would spend the rest of her life drowned in regret.

"Luo Hai, it's your turn!"

Yang Kai's voice sounded again from within the orb, a chilling killing intent wrapping around Luo Hai.

Luo Hai's expression changed drastically; he realized he had underestimated the Star Emperor Token's terrifying might. That Chi Huo had been slain in one blow before his eyes—this was a method he himself could not replicate.

In other words, he was no match!

"Star Force, come!" Luo Hai's face twisted through several expressions as he abandoned seeking compromise and shouted.

He knew that even negotiating with Yang Kai would be useless. He had learned far too many of Yang Kai’s secrets—there was no way any agreement could be reached. Moreover, since Yang Kai had used something as extraordinary as the Star Emperor Token, how could he possibly let him live afterward? Rather than bring humiliation upon himself, it was better to stake everything in one desperate fight.

From somewhere distant in the Star Domain, Cuiwei Star flickered; a vast stellar power surged across the void and poured into Luo Hai.

Luo Hai's aura shot up. Once a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, he was quickly elevated to near the peak, almost indistinguishable from a Third Stage.

Then he fled without looking back.

He used the Stellar Origin's power merely to run—he did not even dare face Yang Kai and Su Yan directly.

"You think you can escape?" Yang Kai laughed, the orb flashing, Spatial Force rippling as it closed the gap in an instant. From the orb burst a terrifying force that shot toward Luo Hai.

Luo Hai panicked; his Void King-Grade Secret Treasure longsword trembled, unleashing a sword light that could almost cut the heavens.

With a soundless collision, space itself collapsed; the sword light was swallowed, yet the force hurled out from the orb sent Luo Hai reeling back hundreds of zhang, his face paling.

In that brief clash he had taken a small loss.

Steadying himself and using the rebounding force, Luo Hai continued to flee, deeper into the Star Domain.

The orb containing Yang Kai and Su Yan would not relent; it flashed again and reappeared before Luo Hai.

“Brat, don’t push me too far!” Luo Hai was so enraged that he nearly spat blood. Though he had long known that Yang Kai cultivated Spatial Force, he never imagined he would be tormented by this power to the point of utter helplessness.

Those who cultivate Spatial Force have innate advantages in pursuit and flight.

If not for that, he would have captured Yang Kai a year ago and never allowed him to flee into Chi Lan Star.

“Now you know what it means to go too far? Did that ever cross your mind when you were chasing me all over the Star Domain? Enough talk — today is the day you die!”

Suddenly a massive spatial rift formed like a gaping beast's maw and lunged at Luo Hai, as if to devour the sun and moon. Luo Hai dared not meet its edge and could only dodge desperately, seeking an opportunity to escape.
