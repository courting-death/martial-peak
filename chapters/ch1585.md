## Chapter 1585 — Half a yao

"Alright, Xue Lian, stop your nagging; since you've come to my palace, you must follow my rules. Do you think this is still your Blood Jiao territory? Didn't the Blood Jiao teach you how to behave before coming here?" Chi Yue scolded. "I'll let this matter drop this time, but if there is a next time, do you know what the consequences will be?"

Xue Lian's expression flickered and he struggled inwardly before clasping his fists and saying, "Xue Lian acted improperly; I beg Lady Chi Yue not to hold it against me."

"Mi Tian, take him back to rest. In a few days you'll be departing — look after him properly. If he causes any more trouble, I'll hold you to account!" Chi Yue cast a cold glare toward Mi Tian, who had been watching the whole scene like a spectator.

"Yes!" Mi Tian answered obediently. No matter how arrogant or disdainful he could be elsewhere, in front of Chi Yue he kept his tail tucked.

The yao's ten great lords were none to be trifled with, and Chi Yue, who ranked very near the top, was especially so.

He hurriedly gave a word to Xue Lian and prepared to lead him away.

"Human, remember this — today's matter isn't over!" Xue Lian glanced at Yang Kai with venom and left behind a chilling threat as he departed.

Yang Kai let out a quiet, cold laugh and watched him go, then withdrew the golden dragon silhouette.

"You should all go your separate ways now." Chi Yue waved casually at Yu Xiong and the others, then turned her gaze to Yang Kai and pondered for a moment. "As for you, come with me."

Saying that, she suddenly reached out and brushed toward Yang Kai, and a gentle force instantly enveloped him.

Sensing that Chi Yue bore no obvious hostility, Yang Kai did not resist and let her do as she pleased.

The next moment, the two of them vanished from where they stood.

"Foster mother!" Shan Qingluo cried out in alarm.

"Don't worry, Little Sister, our foster mother won't harm that fellow. With her formidable power, if she truly wanted to, he wouldn't be able to resist," Yu Xiong reassured.

Shan Qingluo suddenly grew anxious and uncertain, bit her lip, and sprinted toward Chi Yue's bedchamber.

Inside the bedchamber, the figures of Chi Yue and Yang Kai appeared.

Yang Kai glanced around and found the furnishings quite simple, yet every humble touch exuded a noble air.

He guessed to himself that this must be where Chi Yue resided.

After bringing Yang Kai here, Chi Yue stared at him intently, her phoenix-like eyes narrowing, unwavering for a long moment.

Yang Kai remained calm. He met her gaze without fear, composed and unflustered.

After a while, Chi Yue gave a slight nod. Whether it was approval or mockery was unclear. "You have quite the nerve. A human who dares to stare me down like this — I doubt I could find another. Do you think I won't do anything to you?"

"I suppose not." Yang Kai chuckled. "You don't look like someone who bullies the weak."

"If you think that, then you have terribly underestimated the value of the Sacred Dragon Origin you carry!" Chi Yue inhaled deeply and her expression turned grave. "To be frank, I'm very interested in the Sacred Dragon Origin within you. I've thought about killing you to seize that fragment of origin power. With it, I might glimpse the Dao and break through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. Do you know this has been my long-cherished wish for years? Even I am not immune to such temptation!"

Yang Kai still showed no fear and nodded slightly. "Since you say that, it means you don't intend to kill me now. May I ask why?"

"You're clever." Chi Yue snorted and sat down in her chair without hiding anything, explaining plainly, "There are three reasons. First, I cannot guarantee that killing you would allow me to seize that Sacred Dragon Origin. It chose you, which means it recognizes you. I have no assurance I could make it recognize me. Second, even if it did recognize me, I might not gain the chance to break through to the Third Stage."

Yang Kai nodded faintly. "And the third?"

"You are the man Qingluo has taken a liking to. If I truly killed you, I would lose Qingluo — it's not worth the price. Her potential far exceeds mine!"

"You speak plainly — I admire that," Yang Kai grinned.

"Don't flatter me; I don't take to such nonsense." Chi Yue's face darkened. "Though I no longer wish to kill you, do you realize how much trouble you've caused this time?"

Yang Kai frowned and thought for a moment. "Do you mean Xue Lian?"

"What trouble is he?" Chi Yue snorted. "The trouble I mean is the other lords on Di Chen!"

Yang Kai frowned, but he soon grasped why Chi Yue would say that.

"You still underestimate how much the Sacred Dragon Origin attracts people like us. If a human in the Void King Realm discovers the Sacred Dragon Origin within you, he might be shocked and try to snuff you out in your cradle. But for us yao it's different. The Sacred Dragon is the supreme sovereign, worshipped by my billions upon billions of people. Tell me — who wouldn't want such a thing? Once the news leaks, the other nine lords on Di Chen will certainly come to my territory; they'll come for you! Then tell me, will I protect you or not? Even if I am strong, two fists cannot beat four hands. Do you understand the grave trouble you've brought me?"

"Uh..." Yang Kai was startled. "I didn't think of that. But, Lady Chi Yue, this wasn't entirely my fault, was it? Didn't you bear some responsibility?"

He had fought Xue Lian for so long; Yang Kai couldn't believe Chi Yue hadn't noticed. Since she had noticed and still didn't stop it, she had implicitly allowed it — perhaps even let the fight go on.

Chi Yue shot Yang Kai a vicious glare and naturally wouldn't admit to that.

"One word: we are not kin. You brought this trouble upon yourself; you must resolve it yourself. I will not intervene," Chi Yue snorted, almost sweeping Yang Kai out the door.

"Heh, I didn't ask for your protection anyway." Yang Kai rubbed his nose. “If they want the Sacred Dragon Origin within me, they’ll have to show they have the skill to take it!”

Chi Yue's dark brows furrowed and she stared at him blankly, as if taken aback. After a long moment she sneered, "Just how arrogant are you to not even regard our yao lords? I'm aware humans are often presumptuous, but none like you."

"Only those with the ability can afford to be arrogant!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. "To be blunt, even if you wanted to kill me, you might not succeed."

Chi Yue's phoenix eyes narrowed and her tone chilled. "You are provoking me!"

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. "I don't mean to provoke; I'm merely speaking plainly."

Chi Yue examined him carefully, seemingly trying to determine if he was bluffing. Yang Kai's solemn, unflinching expression surprised her — where did his confidence come from?

She was a Second Stage Void King, while he was at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, a full great realm below her. Even if he had fought well against Xue Lian, Chi Yue was confident she could kill him with a single strike.

In all her years she had never seen such a brazen, arrogant human youth as Yang Kai.

Yet he undeniably possessed a unique charisma beneath his arrogance. No wonder Qingluo had fallen hopelessly for him.

"You still have a trump card you haven't used!" surprise finally flickered across Chi Yue's pretty face.

She had assumed Yang Kai had exhausted himself against Xue Lian, but hearing him boast so freely made her realize he had held back before.

Xue Lian's defeat was deserved. Such a human had already surpassed every rising yao talent; men like Mi Tian and Xue Lian were mediocre compared to him...

"Indeed!" Yang Kai admitted heartily.

Chi Yue let out a soft breath and regarded Yang Kai as if she were looking at a monster. After a long while she waved listlessly. "Forget it. At this point there's no use poking into it. You, for all intents and purposes, are half a yao now. As an elder, I won't make things too hard on you. I also won't stop you and Qingluo from whatever develops between you two — let nature take its course."

"How am I half a yao?" Yang Kai shouted, bewildered. Chi Yue's assessment annoyed him — he was thoroughly human!

He was, through and through, unmistakably a human being!

"Hmph! Do you think that insults you?" Chi Yue looked at Yang Kai coldly. "This is an opportunity others could only beg for. You'd better look grateful!"

"Opportunity..." Yang Kai's lip twitched. After a moment's thought he asked, "Do you mean that Sacred Dragon Origin?"

"Yes. Your situation is somewhat like Qingluo's: a human body inheriting the powerful origin of a yao, so you're half a yao," Chi Yue nodded.

"Could you explain this Sacred Dragon Origin to me?" Yang Kai pressed.

"What do you want to know?" Chi Yue replied.

"Everything..." Yang Kai smiled and looked at Chi Yue.

Chi Yue frowned slightly, but she showed no sign of anger. Instead, she patiently explained, “You should have heard of the Ancient Divine Spirits. In ancient times, some powerful beings were born alongside the very formation of Heaven and Earth—those were the Ancient Divine Spirits. They are the progenitors of my yao race and the mightiest existences of that era! My yao race today, with its countless branches, all evolved from the bloodlines of the Ancient Divine Spirits. It’s just that some races inherited a thinner bloodline and are thus weaker, while others inherited a richer one and appear stronger. Mm, the Xue Lian you fought carries the bloodline of the Blood Jiao, a branch descended from the Dragon Clan—and his inherited bloodline is not weak. That’s why, when the Sacred Dragon Origin within you revealed itself, he was instantly suppressed. It’s also why your Sacred Dragon Origin was drawn to his Inner Core—because if you were to devour Xue Lian’s Inner Core, your Origin power would increase and grow stronger.”

Yang Kai listened intently and nodded from time to time; after all, these were the words of the Red Moon Domain's Lady. Her authority lent weight to everything she said.
