## Chapter 2306 — Voluntary

At the grand ceremony, the one-eyed Chai Hu gripped Luo Bing’s slender neck with one hand and pressed the other hand against her back, Saint Yuan surging within him, ready to strike at any moment.

The guards of the City Lord’s mansion exchanged glances, faces filled with worry and resentment. With their young lady held hostage, they dared not act rashly, fearing they would anger Chai Hu and that he would harm Luo Bing. If that happened, their own deaths would not be far off.

In their anxiety, they all looked to Luo Jin, waiting to see what orders he would give.

Luo Jin’s eyelids narrowed slightly as he gave a subtle signal. The guards understood at once, silently spreading out to surround Chai Hu on all sides, preventing his escape.

The guests at Chai Hu and Luo Bing’s table had already scattered the moment he stood and seized her, fleeing in all directions.

“Old dog Luo Jin! If you still care about your daughter’s life, you’d better keep your people in line!” Chai Hu’s single eye gleamed fiercely as he watched his surroundings warily, shouting low at Luo Jin.

Luo Jin snorted coldly, raising his hand in a calming gesture to signal the guards to stay put. Only then did he look at Chai Hu and say, “This Lord seems to have seen you somewhere before!”

Chai Hu sneered mockingly, “I am a nobody. Of course the City Lord wouldn’t remember.”

Luo Jin said, “No matter what grudges exist between us, they have nothing to do with my daughter. Release her, and this Lord will agree to talk things over with you.”

Chai Hu laughed loudly, “Talk? What is there to talk about with a despicable, shameless man like you? Do you take me for a child?”

Luo Jin said, “It seems you’ve held a grudge against this Lord for a long time. Those words Bing’er spoke earlier—were they forced out of her by you?”

At this, the surrounding guests fell into sudden enlightenment—no wonder Luo Bing had embarrassed her father in such a setting. If she had been forced, it would explain her lack of decorum.

“If you say so, then so be it!” Chai Hu snorted, not bothering to explain.

“He didn’t force me…” At that moment, Luo Bing suddenly interjected. “Father, I said those things myself. Please let that young lady go—she’s done nothing wrong.”

Luo Jin’s face darkened instantly at her words.

The expressions of the surrounding guests grew even more bewildered. They truly couldn’t understand what was happening—Luo Bing was being held hostage, her life in someone else’s hands, so why was she speaking up for the other woman?

Luo Jin took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “Bing’er, don’t be afraid. Father will save you.” With that, he looked at Chai Hu again and said, “For you to be so bold as to sneak into the ceremony and take this Lord’s beloved daughter hostage, what exactly do you want?”

Chai Hu sneered, “Why pretend, City Lord? Others may not know why I’m here, but surely you do.”

Luo Jin frowned, narrowing his eyes. “State your terms. If it’s possible, this Lord will accept. As long as my daughter is safe, I am willing to pay any price!”

He spoke righteously, his expression solemn, drawing praise from the guests all around.

Someone immediately said to Chai Hu, “Friend, your actions are too reckless. The City Lord has always cared for the people and is diligent in his duties, with an excellent reputation. Miss Luo Bing is innocent and kind. Why not speak calmly? There’s no need to make things so difficult for everyone. Listen to me—let Miss Luo Bing go. The City Lord will not make things hard for you.”

“That’s right, let Miss Luo go and everything can be discussed.”

“Release her quickly! If the City Lord doesn’t punish you, we will!”

The crowd grew restless—some tried to persuade with kind words, others hurled threats. Chai Hu seemed to grow more tense, his grip on Luo Bing tightening, making her struggle to breathe, her face turning pale.

"Shut up, all of you!" Chai Hu suddenly roared. Now surrounded on all sides and on edge, the shouts from the crowd only made him more agitated.

“If anyone dares say another word, I’ll kill her right now! I mean what I say!” Chai Hu glared with his single eye, shouting explosively.

Seeing this, the guests dared not utter another sound, all falling silent for fear of provoking this madman into harming Luo Bing.

Luo Jin’s face darkened as he shouted, “Speak! What do you want this Lord to do?”

Chai Hu turned his head, glaring at Luo Jin. “Let the person by your side go!”

“Who do you mean?” Luo Jin asked, feigning ignorance.

Chai Hu barked, “If you keep playing dumb, I’ll kill your daughter right now!”

Luo Jin’s expression changed. “So you’re here to steal the bride?”

Chai Hu sneered, “She’s not marrying you of her own will, so how is this stealing? I’m just here to save her.”

Luo Jin said, “You haven’t even asked her—how do you know she’s not willing?”

Chai Hu replied, “How could she possibly want to marry you? You’re dreaming!”

Luo Jin smiled. “Perhaps you misunderstand. Though I don’t know you, it seems you’re a friend of… my wife. To go this far for a friend, this Lord is impressed! Since you’re her friend, you’re also a friend of this Lord. How about this—ask my wife yourself if she’s willing to marry me. If she says no, I’ll let you go and won’t force anyone. How about it?”

Chai Hu’s expression shifted several times, as if he couldn’t believe his ears. He hesitated, “Do you mean it?”

Luo Jin smiled, “With all these guests as witnesses, would this Lord lie?” After a pause, he added, “Or are you just here to cause trouble and ruin my reputation? If so, I won’t let you off lightly.”

Someone chimed in, “That’s right, we’ll all testify for the City Lord!”

“Kid, you’re not just here to make trouble, are you? If so, that’s too despicable.”

Chai Hu’s face remained grim, unmoved by the crowd’s shouts. After a long silence, he finally nodded, “Fine, I’ll trust you this once.”

As he spoke, he turned to look at the bride, saying in a deep voice, “Fifth Sister, you heard the City Lord’s words. Tell me—are you marrying him of your own will, or were you forced? Don’t worry, if you were threatened, your Fourth Brother will risk his life to save you!”

"Your intentions are admirable. This Lord is grateful on behalf of my wife!" Luo Jin smiled calmly.

“Shut up!” Chai Hu snapped.

Luo Jin smiled without replying.

The bride, who had stood silently by his side the whole time—even when Chai Hu caused a scene—suddenly became the focus of everyone’s attention. All eyes turned to her, waiting to hear her answer.

Under everyone’s gaze, the bride’s delicate body trembled for a moment. Then, from beneath the red veil, Yue’er’s voice sounded: “I… am willing!”

“What!” Chai Hu’s body shook, stunned. He never expected to hear such an answer.

But that voice was unmistakably his Fifth Sister’s—not an imposter.

For a moment, he simply couldn’t accept it.

Luo Jin looked at him and smiled, “Now you should understand. This Lord and my wife were drawn to each other at first sight. If not, I would never have married her.”

“Eldest Brother Chai…” Luo Bing turned her head, looking at Chai Hu in confusion. She couldn’t understand why things were so different from what he’d told her. After all, Chai Hu had said today’s bride was being forced to marry her father, but from the bride’s own mouth came a completely different answer.

“Impossible, absolutely impossible!” Chai Hu shouted.

Luo Jin’s face darkened as he barked, “This Lord has given you enough face. For the sake of my wife’s friendship with you, I don’t wish to make things difficult. I hope you know what’s best!”

“That’s right, friend, don’t make trouble anymore, or everyone will lose face.”

“Exactly. Let Miss Luo Bing go. I believe with the City Lord’s magnanimity, he won’t make things hard for you. Let’s all sit together and enjoy the wedding feast—wouldn’t that be wonderful?”

“You brat, enough is enough! If you want to die, this old man doesn’t mind sending you on your way!”

The guests started shouting again, their impression of Chai Hu at rock bottom.

“This is impossible.” Chai Hu muttered, “Fifth Sister can’t possibly be marrying you of her own will—she must have been forced!” As he spoke, he seemed to remember something and shouted, “It must be Eldest Brother and Second Brother, right?!”

“What are you talking about?” The onlookers looked utterly confused.

But Chai Hu threw his head back and laughed, his voice booming like thunder, as if he’d figured something out and finally let go of his obsession. After a while, he suddenly glared at Luo Jin, gritting his teeth, “Old bastard, you really are cunning! You used Eldest Brother and Second Brother to force Fifth Sister to marry you. If you don’t want your daughter’s blood to spill here today, you’d better do as I say!”

Luo Jin grew angry, shouting, “You dare go back on your word?”

Chai Hu sneered, “With a despicable man like you, what credit is there to keep? No matter what, I’m taking Fifth Sister away today. Anyone who tries to stop me, I’ll kill her!” As he spoke, his grip tightened again.

Luo Bing cried out in alarm.

Luo Jin’s face changed dramatically. “Wait!”

“Are you letting her go or not?” Chai Hu shouted.

Luo Jin’s face was as dark as water, the atmosphere in the hall suddenly oppressive as a storm. He gritted his teeth for a long while before finally saying, “Since you’re so suspicious, let my wife explain it to you herself!”

As he spoke, he glanced at the bride beside him.

Chai Hu’s expression brightened at these words. “Fifth Sister, come here.”

The bride hesitated for a moment, then slowly walked toward Chai Hu.

“Looks like that brat is in trouble,” Yang Kai, who had been watching coldly from a nearby table, suddenly muttered.

The people from Thousand Leaves Sect had been enjoying the spectacle, delighted no matter what Chai Hu’s motives were or how things ended. After all, Luo Jin’s reputation had already suffered. In the future, this day would be talked about in every teahouse and tavern, and those who didn’t know the truth would surely believe Luo Jin had done something to bully and oppress women, damaging his authority and image.
