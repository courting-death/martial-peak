## Chapter 1757 — Escape

Blooming Lotus! Yang Kai's most powerful Divine Sense offensive technique.

Faced with such a strange black shadow, he no longer dared to probe; he struck with a killing move at once.

The lotus pattern flashed and vanished, and in the next moment it appeared inside the body of the black shadow; the lotus began to slowly bloom, and the source of the blooming power was the black shadow's own root force!

The black shadow suddenly halted less than one chi away from Yang Kai, then toppled to the ground, letting out continuous, miserable howls.

By the time the lotus had fully opened, the black shadow had already vanished, replaced in its place by a black lotus that immediately disintegrated and dissolved into nothingness.

Only then did Yang Kai have the leisure to check on the others.

Luo Lan was the nearest to him. When Yang Kai turned to look, he was astonished to find that behind this First Stage of the Void King Realm expert stood a humanoid black shadow exactly the same as the one he had just destroyed—only a shape, with no facial features, an uncanny existence.

At that moment, the shadow seemed to be crouched upon Luo Lan's back; from where its face should be, something like a sucker extended and pierced through the back of her skull.

A wicked force radiated from that shadow, affecting Luo Lan's thoughts and pulling her divine soul into an illusion.

Luo Lan herself did not know what kind of illusion she was experiencing; her delicate body trembled continuously, her expression shifting, the hair at her brow soaked with sweat, and with each breath her chest rose and fell.

"There are more than one!" Yang Kai exclaimed in alarm.

He had assumed the enemy who attacked him and Luo Lan was the same shadow, but now it was clear: deep beneath the ground there were far more of these things.

Looking a little farther, Xue Yue and Ni Guang were in the same situation. Each had a shadow crouched on their back; from the shadows' faces extended sucker-like appendages that penetrated into the back of their skulls.

No one had noticed when these shadows had attacked, for even Ni Guang had been struck.

Judging by the looks of it, his situation moments ago must have been exactly the same as theirs.

Wind howled all around and sorrowful, mournful cries never ceased.

A chill ran over Yang Kai's body; he spun and scanned the surroundings, his expression changing.

While he hesitated, countless humanoid black shadows crawled up out of the fissures in the ground from all directions; the moment they appeared they turned their faces toward Yang Kai. Though they had no eyes, he still felt as if innumerable gazes were fixed upon him.

"So many!" Yang Kai's face truly paled this time.

He no longer hesitated. He rushed toward Luo Lan, concentrating his Divine Sense into a sharp spike and striking at the black shadow clinging to her back.

His Divine Sense was extremely strong, rivaling experts like Ni Guang, so a single impact made the shadow attacking Luo Lan's body tremble. Its once-intense form dimmed considerably, clearly badly wounded.

When Yang Kai struck it with his divine soul again, it let out a miserable shriek and immediately dissipated into smoke.

Relief washed over Yang Kai; only then did he realize that with his Divine Sense it was not difficult to destroy these shadows—two strikes were enough.

But… their numbers were simply too great.

With the shadow gone, Luo Lan let out a soft cry and was torn free from the illusion; when she opened her eyes she saw Yang Kai standing almost within arm's reach. Her gaze was still somewhat dazed; she had not yet fully shaken off the previous illusion.

Yang Kai barked at her, "Elder Luo, if you don't want to die then wake up! Use your soul power to fight them!"

"Them?" Luo Lan frowned slightly. "Who are they?"

Yang Kai didn't need to answer. Amid the howls, many shadows lunged at Luo Lan and Yang Kai.

Luo Lan let out a startled cry and finally reacted, waving her hand; a short sword without a hilt, radiating brilliant light, suddenly appeared before her. Under her control the short sword danced up and down; any shadow that approached was struck down by a single cut and turned to nothing.

After all, she was a Void King Realm expert, and that radiant hiltless short sword was clearly a Divine Soul Secret Treasure of considerable power, driven by Divine Sense—a nemesis to these shadows.

Seeing this, Yang Kai breathed easier and shouted, "Hold on, I'll wake Senior Ni and Xue Yue!"

"Hurry!" beads of cold sweat dotted Luo Lan's brow. Although only an instant had passed since she engaged these shadows, she already realized how troublesome they were—their sheer numbers!

Luo Lan fought while retreating, and together with Yang Kai rushed toward the positions of Ni Guang and Xue Yue; any shadow that blocked their path was shattered by Yang Kai's Divine Sense strikes.

He had no Divine Soul Secret Treasure like Luo Lan, but his Divine Sense cultivation was very strong, so the route ahead remained largely clear.

In a short while he reached Ni Guang's side and unleashed a fierce Divine Sense assault on the humanoid shadow clinging to his back.

After two strikes, Ni Guang was saved!

The instant the shadow was destroyed, Ni Guang shot awake; rage blazed in his eyes and his robes billowed as if moved by wind.

He rose to his full height and shouted sternly, “Chimeras and demons—how dare you try to disturb this old man’s state of mind! You almost succeeded!”

From his bearing Yang Kai could tell Ni Guang's condition was much better than Luo Lan's. At the very least, even though Ni Guang had been struck, he was aware of his situation; his delayed awakening had been caused by his inability to break free from the illusion.

With Yang Kai’s assistance, he immediately regained his boundless vigor.

With a flick of his great sleeve, a continuous hiss filled the air as countless attacks shot out in all directions.

"Senior Ni, these things are not afraid of Saint Yuan or Secret Treasures; you must attack them with Divine Sense!" Yang Kai reminded him when he saw Ni Guang falter.

"I see!" Ni Guang realized. He opened his mouth and spat out a round bead; the moment it appeared it burst with light—bright yet extremely gentle. In an instant the deep underground area became as bright as daytime.

Centered on that bead, everything within a radius of ten zhang was visible in minute detail.

All the shadows that entered this sphere of light twisted and contorted, emitted miserable screams, their color fading as they quickly dissipated.

The scene was like snowflakes falling into a volcanic crater—vaporized without a trace in an instant!

Seeing this, Yang Kai felt greatly reassured; he made a lunge to Xue Yue's side and, using the same method, eliminated the shadow clinging to her back.

Xue Yue's situation was undoubtedly the worst. Although she was the Young Master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, heaven-defying in talent, and had already reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm at a young age, her foundation could not compare with the other three present.

When Luo Lan was rescued by Yang Kai, she had seemed dazed for a moment but quickly understood the situation.

Xue Yue, however, after Yang Kai freed her, still kept her eyes tightly shut with no sign of waking.

Her expression was extraordinarily strange; a smile played at the corner of her mouth, her whole body utterly relaxed, the smile full of happiness and sweetness, as if in the illusion she had been experiencing something wonderful.

"Xue Yue!" Yang Kai placed his hand on her shoulder and shook her while calling her name.

After two or three shakes, Xue Yue frowned and opened her eyes with some displeasure; but when she saw Yang Kai standing before her she suddenly smiled, reaching to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear—an utterly feminine gesture performed in a man's guise, rather incongruous to behold. Fortunately, with Yang Kai, Ni Guang and Luo Lan all cutting down the shadows, no one paid attention to that odd detail.

She asked softly, "You're awake?"

"What do you mean 'I'm awake'?" Yang Kai was bewildered and barked, "You'd better wake up properly!"

"Me?" Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai blankly; the happy, sweet light in her eyes gradually cleared, and she seemed to finally come to her senses and began to take in her surroundings.

In that instant Xue Yue understood everything; disappointment flooded her beautiful eyes, as if she was somewhat reluctant to leave the illusion she had just been in.

"There are too many of them; we can't kill them all—it's best to retreat!" Ni Guang shouted when Yang Kai roused Xue Yue. As he spoke he threw the gentle-glowing bead up into the air and then followed, shouting, "Follow me!"

"You go first; I will stay to cover the rear!" Luo Lan did not hurry to flee—she willingly took on the task of rearguard.

Yang Kai nodded, grabbed Xue Yue by the arm, and climbed upward with her; Luo Lan then followed close behind.

The four of them sped upward with great haste, trying to escape that dangerous place.

But the shadows below refused to relent, pursuing them closely. From the cracks all around, more and more dark figures surged forth. Each one howled, releasing waves of energy akin to a Divine Sense attack. Such assaults were formless and invisible—individually weak, but when combined, formidable beyond measure. These waves battered at the four’s Divine Souls, striking their Seas of Consciousness, as though intending to drag them once again into an endless abyss.

But under the might of Ni Guang's and Luo Lan's Secret Treasures they could not get close and were slain one after another.

Then Luo Lan, who was covering their retreat, cried out in alarm, "This is…"

In the next moment she shouted hoarsely at the top of her lungs, "Run!"

Her voice carried a note of panic, as if something terrible was about to happen.

Yang Kai stole a moment to glance downward and was instantly horrified.

He saw the countless shadows below beginning to merge during the pursuit; shadow after shadow flowed like droplets toward a single point and in the blink of an eye formed an enormous humanoid black shadow, and as more small shadows joined it the giant continued to grow.

It seemed to touch the heavens with its head and press the earth with its feet; that posture alone gave off a tremendous sense of oppression.

In no more than three breaths' time the gigantic black shadow had taken shape.
