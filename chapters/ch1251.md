## Chapter 1251 — No Difference

“That’s right—this is the Blood Fusion Pill bestowed by the Elders. It can help our Demon Blood Sect disciples refine their blood bodies and break through bottlenecks! You want it?” A dangerous smile crept across Deng Ning's face, then, without ceremony, he tossed the Blood Fusion Pill toward the Flowing Flame Sandland and laughed wildly: “If you want it, go pick it up — see if you can get it out!”

He knew he couldn't hold onto the Blood Fusion Pill against the two Senior Brothers working together, yet he still wouldn't hand it over to someone else.

“Stop him!” Ye Yangrong shouted, seeming to move against Deng Ning to stop him, but in a flick of motion he instead twisted and lunged after the Blood Fusion Pill.

An Zhiyong made a feint as well and likewise charged for the Blood Fusion Pill; astonishingly, the two men now shared the same goal.

Deng Ning, furious, gave it everything he had; the Blood Fusion Pill flew out at terrifying speed and, in the blink of an eye, plunged into the dark-red energy barrier of the Flowing Flame Sandland and disappeared. By the time Ye Yangrong and An Zhiyong chased after it, there was nothing they could do.

For a moment both men's faces went ashen; they spun around, furious and humiliated, glaring at Deng Ning with murderous intent plain in their eyes. The gentle smiles and patient admonitions were gone — now they wanted nothing more than to tear Deng Ning limb from limb.

Once the Blood Fusion Pill had been thrown into the Flowing Flame Sandland, it was impossible to retrieve; they had no confidence to storm such a forbidden place with only the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and at this moment the Flowing Flame Sandland was at its fiercest — entering meant ten deaths and no life.

The instant he threw the Blood Fusion Pill, Deng Ning bolted, trying to leave. But Ye Yangrong shouted and suddenly blurred, turning into a blood cloud that streaked above Deng Ning; the cloud wrapped around him.

Inside the blood cloud, murderous qi soared and a sickening reek of blood spread, enough to make one retch.

In a flash, Deng Ning's terrified voice came from within the blood cloud: “Demon Blood Transformation! When did you master it?”

He sounded shocked at the means Ye Yangrong had used; his voice trembled. In the next instant sounds of fierce fighting and Deng Ning's muffled groans came from inside the blood cloud.

Ye Yangrong’s sinister, chilling laugh echoed out. “Your Senior Brother is hardly talented, but I already caught a glimpse of the Demon Blood Transformation’s mysteries three years ago. This is merely my first time using it in battle. Junior Brother Deng—let’s see where you can run this time!”

As he spoke he ordered, “Junior Brother An, kill that annoying man. Give me a hand; though the Blood Fusion Pill is gone, as far as I know Junior Brother Deng also has the secret method for Demon Blood Threads. If you want it, act quickly.”

An Zhiyong's face darkened when Ye Yangrong turned into a blood cloud to envelop Deng Ning; he hadn't expected his Senior Brother to be so scheming, to have cultivated such a secret technique three years ago without showing it. A look of intense caution crept across his face.

With the Blood Fusion Pill lost, he hesitated — after all, even joining Ye Yangrong to kill Deng Ning might not yield much benefit.

But when he heard mention of the secret Demon Blood Threads cultivation method, his heart stirred; his eyes brightened and he looked uncertain.

Ye Yangrong, as if sensing his worry, shouted loudly: “Junior Brother An, this Demon Blood Transformation consumes an enormous amount of my Saint Yuan. It’s already quite taxing to deal with Junior Brother Deng—there’s no need for you to fear I’ll turn on you afterward. Besides, with your abilities, Senior Brother wouldn’t be so foolish as to court trouble himself.”

An Zhiyong pondered grimly, then made a decision; his expression hardened and he nodded: “Fine, then Junior Brother will join Senior Brother once more!”

Having said that, he turned and coldly fixed his gaze on Yang Kai.

At that moment a flash of fire shot out from the Flowing Flame Sandland, streaked past and struck Yang Kai in the chest. An Zhiyong, who saw it, was momentarily stunned and frowned: “What was that?”

“Nothing.” Yang Kai sighed lightly and considered, then said, “If I tell you I have nothing to do with your Junior Brother and I wasn't his accomplice ambushing you here, would you believe me?”

“You expect me to believe that?” An Zhiyong snorted.

“If it were me, I wouldn't believe it either.” Yang Kai looked resigned. Never mind that Deng Ning had shown delight when he saw him before and that the two seemed to know each other — this was the Flowing Flame Sandland. Even on the outer edge it was unbearably hot; Yang Kai appearing here, if it wasn't arranged by Deng Ning, what else could he be doing but courting trouble?

Apart from the opening times when there are crowds, no one would willingly come near the Flowing Flame Sandland.

If Ye Yangrong and An Zhiyong weren't chasing Deng Ning, they wouldn't be here. Deng Ning himself had been driven to despair and had come hoping for luck, attempting to shake off his two Senior Brothers, only to find the Blood Fusion Pill's temptation too great; they pursued relentlessly.

By coincidence, Yang Kai had been swept into this quarrel.

“Will you end this yourself or shall I?” An Zhiyong looked down on Yang Kai and didn't mean to place him in his sight. He glanced at the fight in the blood cloud, not eager to attack Yang Kai — if the battle there intensified, it only benefited him. He hoped Deng Ning and Ye Yangrong would tear each other apart so he could take advantage.

“What’s the difference?” Yang Kai grinned, unafraid.

“A big difference. If you end it yourself you can die quickly; if I do it… heh heh.”

“I think there's no difference.” Yang Kai shook his head slowly, a derisive curl at his lips. He said calmly, “Either way, you're going to die!”

An Zhiyong froze; when he understood what Yang Kai meant, his face hardened with malice: “Big words — no wonder Deng Ning sought your help. Let's see how you make me die!”

As he spoke, blood-light flared around him; his once unremarkable aura now exuded a bloody stench.

Yang Kai frowned. Though he'd never tangled with members of the Demon Blood Sect before, from Ye Yangrong and An Zhiyong's Saint Yuan fluctuations it was clear they cultivated an evil art; otherwise they wouldn't radiate such murderous qi and violent aura.

When this kind of aura is cultivated to its peak, releasing it in battle can shake an opponent’s very soul. Those whose minds are not firm are easily affected by such baleful and violent energy — at best, their momentum is suppressed; at worst, they lose the will to fight. One could say that in combat, it grants an immense advantage.

But equally, such murderous qi and Violent Aura are easily countered; as long as one has the most stalwart, most yang Saint Yuan, it can be suppressed.

Yang Kai's Indomitable Golden Body had once stored this sort of evil power, so he understood such matters.

After releasing his own aura, An Zhiyong didn’t immediately strike. Instead, he looked Yang Kai up and down with great interest, as though wanting to see him trembling in fear beneath the pressure of his baleful energy.

The opponent's cultivation was one stage lower, so An Zhiyong was confident he could crush Yang Kai; once the other's fighting will faltered he would play with him, wearing him down like a cat with a mouse.

To An Zhiyong's surprise, after his violent aura surged at the young man, Yang Kai's face did not change; instead he showed contempt rather than the usual panic, which made An Zhiyong pause and nod: “Well, well, there's some skill here — I underestimated you.”

As he spoke, his aura suddenly retracted, and a surge of crimson light flared from his body, as if fresh blood were gushing out from within him. In an instant, it condensed into a cloud of blood mist, which twisted and churned before transforming into a massive blood-red hand that thrust straight toward Yang Kai.

Shura Blood Hand!

A secret technique of the Demon Blood Sect, only their disciples can cultivate it. Its power might not be immense, but the evil qi embedded in the blood-hand is uncanny and hard to guard against. Once tainted, a man's blood boils and life becomes worse than death.

All the Demon Blood Sect's secret arts generally have this difficult-to-defend effect, so on Dark Star most warriors avoid fighting Demon Blood Sect members — one misstep can lead to disaster.

As the Shura Blood Hand thrust forward, An Zhiyong snapped his fingers and streams of red light shot out, transforming into blood-colored spikes that hid behind the hand like surprise attacks.

He didn't expect to kill Yang Kai in one blow; from the young man's earlier performance it was clear he wasn't weak. This was more of a probe to test Yang Kai's depth.

The blood-hand flew at him and Yang Kai simply threw a punch, black flames winding around his fist, radiating intense heat.

The two collided and the blood-hand was split like snow under the sun by the black flames; even the blood-colored light was suppressed by the darkness. The blood spikes following the hand couldn't harm Yang Kai either — he formed several Vast Heaven Shields that easily blocked them.

Seeing this, An Zhiyong was stunned, immediately realizing that this Second Stage of the Saint King Realm opponent's combat power was in no way inferior to his. He no longer hesitated. With a wave of his hand a blood-red short axe appeared — its shape odd, part axe, part curved blade, wholly crimson and terrifyingly savage.

The moment the short axe landed in his hand, An Zhiyong’s aura surged violently. He swung the weapon with both hands and brought it down in a fierce, cleaving strike.

A blood-light shot from the axe, forming a blood-blade like the axe itself, hurtling toward Yang Kai. He swung the axe again and again; one blood-blade after another shot out until a countless array of blood-blades gathered and pressed down on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face hardened — the other had gone all out — and he did not underestimate him. He drew his Purple Shield and held it before him.

Although the Purple Shield's spirit had been badly damaged when it subdued the Artifact Spirit, its defensive power remained — it simply could no longer use its sandstorm function.
