## Chapter 2368 — The Preciousness of Source Crystals

Yang Kai had only been sitting in the room for a short while when a knock sounded at the door.

Liu Qianyun glanced at him, and after receiving his signal, finally opened the door.

The scarred man they had seen earlier on the deck appeared at the door with a fawning smile, nodding and bowing to Liu Qianyun. "Greetings to you both, honored guests. Forgive my abrupt visit—hope I haven't disturbed your cultivation?"

Liu Qianyun asked, "What is it?"

The scarred man chuckled, "Big Sister sent me to check if you two need anything. If there's anything you want, just say the word—we'll do our best to help."

Liu Qianyun looked bewildered, not understanding why this fellow was so attentive. As the saying goes, 'no one flatters without a reason; either a thief or a schemer.' She couldn't help but be wary—she and Yang Kai had just arrived and didn't know the situation here.

The scarred man continued, "Here are some dishes prepared for you both. There's not much to offer on the ship, so please don't mind."

Only now did Liu Qianyun notice the tray in his hands, holding two plates of strange-looking meat and a wine jug. The meat looked odd, probably some kind of beast, but the aroma was enticing.

"Is he trying to poison us?" Liu Qianyun's expression turned odd. She wanted to refuse, but since the man had brought the food himself, it felt rude to turn him away. Helpless, she glanced back at Yang Kai, seeking his opinion.

"Come in and speak," Yang Kai said, looking completely unconcerned.

Hearing this, the scarred man brightened, "Thank you for having me."

Liu Qianyun stepped aside, letting the scarred man enter. He set the tray on the table and looked at Yang Kai with eager eyes, his fawning smile never fading.

Yang Kai smiled, "Is this food free, or do we have to pay?"

The scarred man chuckled, scratching his head, "It's just a little token from the brothers—no charge, of course. But... you know how it is."

Liu Qianyun snorted, displeased, thinking everyone on this ship was obsessed with money. Two plates of unknown meat and a jug of cheap wine, and they still dared to ask for payment.

If someone gave her this outside, she wouldn't even look at it.

Yang Kai mused, "Is it hard to get Source Crystals here?"

The scarred man's face fell. "If you live here long enough, you'll know Source Crystals are the most precious thing in this place."

Otherwise, why would he shamelessly try every trick to get Source Crystals from Yang Kai?

"Can't you get Source Crystals here?" Liu Qianyun asked suspiciously.

The scarred man replied, "No, you can't. This Jixu Secret Realm is filled everywhere with transforming force. If a Source Crystal, pure energy, is exposed to it, it'll be neutralized and dissipate into the Secret Realm. So, there are no Source Crystal mines here. That's also why the Spiritual Qi in Jixu Secret Realm is so dense."

Liu Qianyun had seen a Source Crystal vanish quickly before, so hearing this, she understood much more. Her dislike for the ship's martial artists faded a bit, realizing why they all seemed so obsessed with money.

The scarred man sighed, "All the Source Crystals in Jixu Secret Realm are brought in by outsiders. Inside, you won't find a single one."

Yang Kai nodded, just as he had guessed. When he saw the Source Crystal disappear earlier, he had suspected as much. Now, with the explanation, he knew he was right.

In this cursed place, Source Crystals really were precious.

"How should I address you?" Yang Kai asked.

The scarred man quickly replied, "Jiao Yi. Big Sister calls me Old Jiao. Call me whatever you like!"

"Sit, Brother Jiao. I have some questions for you." Yang Kai gestured, then took out a bag of Source Crystals from his Spatial Ring, placed it on the table, and pushed it toward him.

Jiao Yi's eyes lit up like a starving ghost seeing food. He dragged the bag over, opened it, and was nearly blinded by the glow of the Source Crystals. He hurriedly stashed them in his Spatial Ring, delighted, "Ask away, friend! I could even tell you the color of my underwear!"

"Pah..." Liu Qianyun spat, her cheeks reddening.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, "To be honest, my Junior Sister and I just arrived here and know nothing about this place, so..."

Jiao Yi said, "We knew that already. Who would dare take out Source Crystals in public here in Jixu Secret Realm? The way you acted, it was clear you didn't know the rules."

He was referring to Yang Kai's earlier attempt to trade with Ling Yinqin on the deck.

Yang Kai realized he had exposed himself, so there was no need to hide it. Since they wanted Source Crystals, he might as well use them to get some information.

Jiao Yi sighed, "Live here for a year or two and you'll know how precious Source Crystals are. Let me give you some advice: no matter how many you have, use them sparingly. Otherwise, you'll run out one day. Back in the day, I had millions of Source Crystals and was considered rich. But now..."

He looked pained, clearly regretting his past extravagance.

"How long have you been here, Brother Jiao?"

The question seemed to touch a sore spot. Jiao Yi picked up the cheap wine, poured himself a cup, drank it all, wiped his mouth, and said, "Never counted exactly, but it must be sixty or seventy years."

"Sixty or seventy years!" Liu Qianyun's pretty face changed color instantly.

Jiao Yi glanced at her, "That's nothing. Some have been trapped here for hundreds, even thousands of years."

"There's no way out?" Liu Qianyun asked.

Jiao Yi frowned, "Not sure. Maybe there is, maybe not. I'm not strong, but even if there is a way, it's not easy to leave. Otherwise, those old monsters in Tongtian City would've left long ago instead of suffering here."

Yang Kai asked, "Brother Jiao, did you come in from Jixu Ridge?"

"Jixu Ridge?" Jiao Yi looked confused, thought for a moment, then understood, "Oh, you mean that Jixu Ridge at the border of the Southern and Eastern Territories? I came from a place at the border of the Western and Northern Territories."

"Are there many places leading here?"

"Seems so. People living on Tongtian Island come from all four Great Territories. Just on this ship, more than ten people entered from over ten different places."

"Why so many?" Liu Qianyun asked in surprise.

Jiao Yi shrugged, "No idea."

Yang Kai mused, "The entrances to Jixu Secret Realm must either move or there are many of them. Brother Jiao, what is this Tongtian Island you mentioned?"

Jiao Yi replied, "Tongtian Island is just Tongtian Island. All martial artists in Jixu Secret Realm live there. The island's powers are tangled and complex. If you go there, I suggest you join a strong faction quickly, or you won't survive, especially as newcomers. Many people target newcomers—do you know why?"

"Source Crystals?" Liu Qianyun said seriously.

Jiao Yi nodded, "Exactly. Newcomers always bring some Source Crystals. People die for wealth, birds for food—an eternal truth."

Yang Kai asked, "Are there Emperor Realm experts on the island?"

"Yes, more than one," Jiao Yi replied. "About three to five, I think. The strongest is the master of Tongtian Island, at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. I hear he's been here for thousands of years."

"Even someone at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm is trapped here?" Liu Qianyun's face turned pale, feeling even more hopeless.

Jiao Yi chuckled, "What's strange about that? If you can't find a way out, you can't leave. But the island master has been trapped for so many years, and I hear his cultivation has dropped badly—he's only at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm now, though I'm not sure if that's true." He sighed, "But I think it is. The longer you live here, the more your cultivation falls. I used to be at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but after all these years, I only have the power of the First Stage."

Yang Kai frowned, "Without Source Crystals, how do you cultivate here?"

Jiao Yi said, "By using Purification Arrays. The one in this room isn't high-grade, so the effect isn't great. The higher the grade, the better. When you get to Tongtian City, I suggest you rent a high-grade array in a cave residence—it'll slow your cultivation decline as much as possible. Besides arrays, you can take Spiritual Pills, but those are ridiculously expensive. There aren't many alchemists on the island, and most work for the island master. A single pill costs ten times more than outside."

"How do you survive?" Liu Qianyun couldn't help but feel sorry for Jiao Yi. Life in the Jixu Secret Realm was harsh—it's hard to get by.

Jiao Yi smiled bitterly, "We go out to sea to hunt sea beasts and look for other materials. The inner cores of sea beasts usually sell for a good price. This trip, we're looking for something called Cangyu Coral."

"What's it for?" Liu Qianyun asked.

Jiao Yi replied, "It's the main material for making Formation Foundations for Purification Arrays. If you want to live on Tongtian Island, arrays are essential, so Cangyu Coral sells well." At this, Jiao Yi's eyes lit up, "Are you two interested in joining us? If you are, I'll talk to Big Sister—I'm sure she won't refuse. As for the split, it's fair: you get what you earn."

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun were both newcomers, their strength still at its peak—especially Yang Kai, who was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. If they could recruit him, this trip would surely be fruitful.
