## Chapter 2300 — Lost Her Mind

As their Divine Sense swept over, the two men discovered that this young girl only possessed the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. They exchanged glances, each seeing the restless desire in the other's eyes.

The slightly chubby martial artist forced a smile onto his face, trying to appear mature and reliable, and gently asked, “Little girl, why did you call out to the two of us? Could it be... you’re lost? Hehehehe..."

Luo Bing’s beautiful eyes lit up as she looked at the chubby martial artist in surprise and said, “How did you know? I really am lost. I don’t know how to get back.”

“Uh...” The chubby martial artist was stunned for a moment, thinking he had just made a random guess, but it turned out to be right. Seeing the joy on the girl’s face, which didn’t seem fake, he immediately understood that she must be someone who rarely left home and knew little about the outside world. He coughed lightly, put on a compassionate expression, and said, “Little girl, don’t be afraid. With the two of us here, no one will harm you.”

Luo Bing wiped the tears from the corner of her eye, feeling relieved, and broke into a smile. “That’s great, I knew things weren’t that bad.”

Her smile was like a spring breeze overnight, making a hundred flowers bloom. The two martial artists stared, their eyes wide, swallowing repeatedly as their blood boiled.

“You two, hurry up and send me home! Once I’m back, there will be a heavy reward!” Luo Bing blinked and immediately regained her commanding demeanor, barking orders at the two martial artists.

The two exchanged glances. The slightly thinner martial artist smiled and said, “Alright, alright, we’ll take you home right away. Please, follow us!”

Luo Bing nodded and instructed, “Lead the way!”

She didn’t even ask if they knew who she was or where her home was, simply following behind the two martial artists as they headed deeper into the alley.

The two men clearly had no intention of saying more, just walking forward with their heads down.

Following behind, Luo Bing’s mood seemed to gradually improve. All her previous unhappiness was forgotten. As she walked, she even started humming a little tune, like a happy lark.

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Luo Bing finally sensed something was wrong. She stopped, looked around, and found this place was even more desolate than before. Looking around, there wasn’t a single person in sight. The houses had collapsed, leaving only broken walls and ruins, like a ghostly place. The scene made Luo Bing panic, and she said in a trembling voice, “W-What is this place? Didn’t I tell you to take me home... What are you bringing me here for?”

The two martial artists in front stopped at the same time, turned their heads, and looked at Luo Bing with sinister grins.

Even if Luo Bing was foolish, she now realized something was wrong. These two men... clearly weren’t good people, and they had no intention of taking her home.

“What... what do you want?” Luo Bing’s face turned pale with fear. She hurriedly retreated a few steps, but tripped over something and fell hard to the ground.

Panic and pain surged together, and she immediately burst into tears.

“Hehehe...” The chubby martial artist sneered as he stepped toward Luo Bing. His approaching figure put immense pressure on her, making her heart pound so hard it felt like it would leap from her throat.

“I’m warning you, don’t do anything stupid! Otherwise... otherwise you’ll be dead!” Luo Bing bit her red lips, threatening them with what she thought were her most weighty words.

But things had already come to this point—how could the two men possibly give up so easily?

The thin martial artist laughed, “You’re quite an interesting little girl. Are your parents aware of how naive you are?”

The chubby martial artist leered even more, saying, “Go ahead and scream. Even if you scream until your throat is hoarse, no one will come to help you in this ghostly place.”

As he spoke, the chubby martial artist suddenly lunged at Luo Bing, reaching for her slender neck.

Luo Bing screamed in terror and pushed upward with both palms. As her Saint Yuan surged, she actually unleashed a strike with considerable force.

But after all, she was only a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm martial artist, and she had never liked cultivating. Her meager strength was only achieved with the help of countless heaven-and-earth treasures. Her Saint Yuan was impure and her techniques were unpracticed.

Meanwhile, both the chubby and thin martial artists had already reached the Void King Realm. So, facing her move, the chubby martial artist simply waved his hand and easily neutralized it. Then, with lightning speed, he struck Luo Bing’s shoulder twice.

Luo Bing immediately went limp, unable to muster any strength. Her meridians were blocked, and her cultivation was completely suppressed. She could only watch helplessly as the chubby martial artist grabbed her sash and slowly began to untie it.

“No... don’t...” Luo Bing pleaded through her tears.

The chubby martial artist was aroused by her weak cries, his nostrils flaring with hot breath, eyes reddening as he swallowed and said, “This girl’s voice is... truly a gift from the heavens, for us to encounter such a beauty.”

The thin martial artist was also burning with desire. He suddenly moved to stand above Luo Bing’s head, pinched her delicate cheek, and said, “Such smooth skin... I wonder whose daughter you are. Hehehe, looks like we’re in luck.”

Upon hearing this, Luo Bing somehow found the strength to shout, “I’m the City Lord’s daughter! Let me go right now! If my father finds out, you’ll both be dead!”

As soon as she said this, both martial artists froze, their faces turning pale.

The chubby martial artist broke out in a cold sweat, wiping his forehead again and again, but the sweat just kept coming. He stammered, “N-No way? The City Lord’s daughter?”

The thin martial artist was also terrified, staring at Luo Bing. “W-What’s your name?”

Luo Bing glared at them and gritted her teeth. “My name is Luo Bing!”

Upon hearing this, both martial artists felt a chill run from the soles of their feet to the tops of their heads, shivering uncontrollably. They carefully examined Luo Bing, and the chubby martial artist said in a trembling voice, “It really... really does look like the City Lord’s eldest daughter. I saw her from afar once before...”

“We’re finished... it’s all over...” The thin martial artist, unable to bear the blow, collapsed to the ground, his eyes vacant, muttering to himself.

The chubby martial artist was also trembling all over. He quickly withdrew his filthy hands from Luo Bing’s clothes, looking at her as if trying to force a fawning smile but failing, his expression uglier than crying.

Realizing that the girl before them was actually the City Lord’s daughter, both men were scared out of their wits, their souls nearly leaving their bodies.

They had thought Luo Bing was just a lost little girl. Who would have guessed her background was so significant? If they had known she was the City Lord’s daughter, they wouldn’t have dared act like this even if they had a death wish.

Seeing this, Luo Bing’s eyes lit up and she shouted, “Scared now, aren’t you? If you don’t want to die, obediently send me back to the City Lord’s mansion!”

The chubby martial artist immediately knelt before Luo Bing, kowtowing so hard that his forehead broke open and blood flowed. “My brother and I were blind and offended Miss Luo. Please, Miss Luo, be magnanimous and spare us.”

The thin martial artist seemed to come to his senses as well, crawling over to kowtow and beg for mercy.

Luo Bing looked at the two with disgust and snorted coldly. “Send me back to the City Lord’s mansion, and I’ll spare your lives!”

“Really?” The chubby martial artist looked up at Luo Bing in delight, as if he had survived a disaster.

Luo Bing said, “But while you may escape death, you won’t escape punishment. For what you just did, I’ll have to punish you properly... Let my father lock you up for ten or eight years.”

The faces of the two martial artists changed dramatically, staring at Luo Bing with strange expressions.

“What are you looking at? Believe it or not, I’ll gouge your eyes out!” Luo Bing glared at them fiercely, as if she had regained control of the situation.

“Eldest Brother...” The thin martial artist nudged the chubby one and whispered, “Is this girl... out of her mind?”

If she wasn’t, who would start threatening others before even escaping? Anyone with common sense wouldn’t do that.

The chubby martial artist nodded seriously. “I think so too... Poor City Lord, to have such a daughter!”

“So what do we do now?”

A trace of ruthlessness flashed in the chubby martial artist’s eyes as he said slowly, “What else can we do? We might as well go all the way...” As he spoke, a murderous intent appeared on his face.

The thin martial artist thought for a moment and nodded. “That’s the only way.”

Though their voices were low, Luo Bing heard every word clearly. She had thought she was saved, but now things had taken a turn for the worse. From their words, it seemed they not only wanted to violate her, but might even take her life. Terrified, her face turned pale as she cried out, “What are you doing?! Don’t do this! Take me back to the City Lord’s mansion and I won’t punish you anymore...”

“Too late!” The chubby martial artist sneered. Now that he had made up his mind, he was no longer so afraid. The City Lord was not easy to provoke, but this place was deserted. As long as they handled things cleanly, it might never be traced back to them.

He suddenly pounced, half-kneeling beside Luo Bing. The scent of a maiden filled his nose, making him burn with desire. He puckered his lips and moved in for a kiss, mumbling, “Such a beauty... If I can have her just once, I could die without regret!”

“Get away! No...” Luo Bing kept turning her head, trying to avoid his disgusting face. But with her cultivation sealed and her movements restricted, she could do nothing but watch as his mouth drew closer and closer.

She could almost smell the foul odor from his mouth.

Luo Bing’s mind went blank. In this moment of crisis, the person who appeared in her mind was not her doting father, nor the obedient Qiu Yu, but rather the annoying figure of Yang Kai.

If not for him, if not for him... how could she have ended up in this hellish nightmare?
