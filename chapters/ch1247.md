## Chapter 1247 — Sixth Layer

Yang Kai had intended to stow the Artifact Spirit back into his Spatial Ring, but after regaining its freedom it refused any further restraint; instead it transformed into a tiny Fire Bird, alighted on Yang Kai's shoulder, and with its sharp beak fussed through his hair in a fawning display. No matter how Yang Kai coaxed it, it would not return to the refining furnace.

Yang Kai did not wish to press the matter, so he let it be. The refining furnace, however, could not be placed into his Spatial Ring—otherwise the Artifact Spirit would be forcibly returned to its vessel—so he tucked the compact refining furnace into his bosom and turned to survey the surroundings.

The Fifth Layer was just as it had been more than a month ago—scorching waves of flame surging everywhere, unbearable fire poison saturating the air, and nothing in sight but a sea of blazing red.

Yet Yang Kai discovered that resisting the harsh environment of the Fifth Layer was now much easier than before.

Part of this was due to his increased strength and a small elevation in cultivation Stage, but the chief reason lay in the growth and controllability of his Demonic Flame.

Over a month earlier his Demonic Flame had been beyond his full control; though vast and pure, it still struggled against the Fifth Layer's conditions. Now the nature of his Demonic Flame allowed him to switch between cold and heat in an instant. With the Cold Flame guarding him, he no longer feared the savage heat waves and fire poison; the visible surges of heat were stopped when they came within half a foot of his side.

Yang Kai stood in place, stroked his chin, and pondered; after grasping the reason his spirits lifted.

Moreover, he had initially worried that his time might run short, yet even after finishing the refinement of the Profound Yin Moon Water, the Flowing Flame Sandland had still not closed. Judging by his estimation, however, it should happen within the next few days.

Over the coming days Yang Kai had no desire to return to the Fourth Layer; instead he pressed deeper to see if the Sixth Layer he suspected truly existed.

If it did, what sort of scene would lie within?

Had his Demonic Flame not improved, Yang Kai would never have dared attempt the Sixth Layer—before this he had already been struggling to advance and could not have gone further. But now, protected by the Cold Flame, he had the confidence to probe deeper.

Starting from the Third Layer, the Flowing Flame Sandland had remained unexplored for tens of thousands of years. Within each layer lay astonishing wealth and unimaginable opportunities.

The Third Layer produced the Red Candle Fruit; the Fourth Layer held the ruins of a vast Sect; the Fifth Layer possessed the Earth-Lung Fire Pool and Void King-Grade refining furnaces capable of birthing Artifact Spirits. If a Sixth Layer truly existed, there would certainly be valuable things within.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai did not hesitate. Time was precious and the Flowing Flame Sandland might seal at any moment. He withdrew the Yuan Magnetic Pointer from his Spatial Ring, fixed his bearing, and strode straight toward a chosen spot.

With the Cold Flame shielding him, traversing the Fifth Layer was indeed far easier; apart from the considerable Saint Yuan expenditure, none of the previous difficulties reappeared.

He continuously employed the innate power of his World-Ending Demon Eye, skirting obvious formations and places that appeared dangerous.

The whole way he encountered no peril; even the Artifact Spirit remained unusually docile. It would fly out now and then, but soon return to its perch on Yang Kai's shoulder.

It seemed to understand the danger here and dared not wander recklessly.

For three consecutive days Yang Kai walked within the Fifth Layer—without the Yuan Magnetic Pointer he would surely have lost his way in that crimson world.

One day, while he was on the move, the Artifact Spirit perched on his shoulder suddenly rose and let out an urgent low trill. Its two small eyes scanned ahead with extreme vigilance.

Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart and immediately halted. He swept his World-Ending Demon Eye across the area, but strangely found nothing amiss; his expression darkened.

He knew that within the Flowing Flame Sandland some seals were laid with exquisite subtlety—subtle enough that even his World-Ending Demon Eye could not detect them. It seemed one might be before him now.

That the formation had been detected first by the Artifact Spirit surprised Yang Kai.

The Artifact Spirit had been born from a refining furnace; by rights it should not understand such formations. How had it discovered this? Yang Kai turned to it, puzzled, but the Artifact Spirit continued to trill as if trying to convey some information.

Yang Kai frowned and reached out with his sense; after a moment he looked strange and said, “You mean we’ve already fallen into a formation?”

The Artifact Spirit fell silent, its meaning clear.

“Impossible.” Yang Kai’s face changed. He had been extremely cautious on this journey, avoiding anything that seemed strange and choosing only routes he believed safe. If the Artifact Spirit was correct, then he might have triggered some formation without realizing it.

He turned to look around; nothing appeared special—everything remained the same blazing red and horribly hostile.

There was not even a trace of danger in the air.

This could be a maze or an illusion array-type restriction! Yang Kai trusted that the Artifact Spirit would not cry wolf; only this explanation made sense. When, then, had he stepped into the trap? He could not fathom it.

And since even the World-Ending Demon Eye revealed no clue, it seemed he could not break it himself.

That left only waiting for the Flowing Flame Sandland to close and the realm’s laws to expel him. Fortunately only a few days remained on the time limit, so Yang Kai was not overly concerned.

Just as he prepared to sit cross-legged and rest, the Artifact Spirit on his shoulder suddenly chirped and transformed into a red beam that shot away.

Yang Kai frowned but did not force it back; he faintly sensed the Artifact Spirit had discovered something.

He waited where he stood.

Strangely, after rushing out a hundred zhang the red beam suddenly vanished from Yang Kai’s sight, yet the spirit’s chirps still reached his ear. From the sound he judged it was not far away.

This put Yang Kai more at ease.

After a short while there was an explosive surge of fire Spiritual Qi, and the heavens and earth around him trembled and warped. In that instant Yang Kai at last perceived some traces of a restriction through his World-Ending Demon Eye.

The Artifact Spirit had indeed not lied: they had stepped into an illusion array, though when they had triggered it he had no idea. The world’s distortion was clearly abnormal, a visual deception produced by the array.

The fire Spiritual Qi fluctuations grew ever more violent and the distortion of the world intensified. The surroundings became ghastly, as if haunted; earth and sky cracked open, and even the nearby space tilted and overturned like a mirrored surface.

At one moment, accompanied by a faint sound, the world around Yang Kai suddenly shattered into motes of light.

Simultaneously the heat and harsh conditions vanished, replaced by an extraordinarily rich flow of Spiritual Qi, and the scene before him became a lush, elegant landscape.

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, instinctively thinking this might be another illusion array.

But when he turned his head back his expression grew very odd.

Some ten li behind him a red curtain of light rose from earth to sky; the ground there was scorched and cracked, and countless coils of fire Spiritual Qi slithered within it like little snakes.

That was unmistakably the Fifth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland!

He watched, brow knit, and felt his mind jolt.

He had actually passed through the Fifth Layer and come into the Sixth Layer?

The place he now stood was exactly the Sixth Layer he had guessed—its Spiritual Qi was even denser than that of the mountain range where the Fourth Layer Sect ruin lay.

He could not tell when he had set foot in the Sixth Layer. At the moment he stepped in he had likely been wrapped by the illusion array, which explained why he had remained unaware and assumed he was still within the Fifth Layer.

Now that the illusion had been dispelled, it was clear the array had been broken.

Yang Kai turned again and truly saw a red beam streaking toward him. Moments later the Artifact Spirit’s form reappeared, but now it clutched in its beak a fist-sized, six-sided crystal.

At first glance Yang Kai knew the crystal was abnormal; he could not discern its color. It seemed at once colorless and dazzlingly multicolored—ever-shifting and deeply strange.

As he prepared to examine it more closely, a black vapor welled from within the crystal. The vapor swayed and formed into countless pale-faced, fanged yin souls—ferocious, hateful spirits that blew waves of yin wind as they charged toward him.

Yang Kai was alarmed and flung out his hand; innumerable tongues of Demonic Flame shot forth.

Strange though, those seemingly fearsome yin souls were like a moon reflected in water or flowers in a mirror—fragile and easily dispelled. The Demonic Flame passed through them, they wailed in misery and vanished. At the same time an urgent, angry trill sounded in Yang Kai’s ear.

Yang Kai glanced up and saw the Artifact Spirit still carrying the crystal, beating its wings as it flew and chattered constantly, seemingly unleashing a string of curses at him.

His sudden attack had evidently frightened it.

Yang Kai paid it no heed and instead furrowed his brow.

He now realized those yin souls had not been real—in other words, they were illusions. When they appeared, the World-Ending Demon Eye had already pierced some of their falsity, allowing him to see through them.

That the crystal could induce such an illusion left Yang Kai inwardly alarmed.
