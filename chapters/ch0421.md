## Chapter 421 — As Cunning as a Fox

Xiang Tianxiao’s move had been honed through countless trials. It was a personal technique he had refined through the Xiang Family’s unpassed secret, imbued with the power of thunder and lightning. It was invincible, revered and praised by many of the Xiang Family’s strongest.

This was his killing move, a strike he reserved solely for the most powerful opponents. Its unparalleled force often decided the outcome of a battle in a single blow.

The moment the Xiang Family cultivators saw him unleash such a move, they knew the Second Lord was truly enraged. Otherwise, he would never have revealed such murderous intent so early.

"Let’s see how you block this!" Several Divine Roaming Realm warriors from the Xiang Family sneered with dark delight, their faces cold with grim enjoyment. They believed that once the Second Lord defeated Yang Kai, they could leave without lingering to meddle in the succession war.

Better not get involved in this muddy business.

Qiu Yimeng was also secretly alarmed but wore a composed expression. She had not expected Xiang Tianxiao’s combat power to be so formidable, and that he would strike directly with a killing move. Such a technique was impossible to resist head-on for those below the Divine Roaming Realm, even herself, only at the First Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, had to evade first before seeking an opening.

She wondered whether Yang Kai could withstand it. Although she had witnessed his strength, long without contact left her uncertain how much he had grown.

But recalling the day by Lan River when Yang Kai singlehandedly slew a Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm powerhouse, she quickly calmed.

Even if Xiang Tianxiao was strong, surely he was no match for a Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm warrior, right?

With a sudden blast of noise, the ball of lightning at the tip of Xiang Tianxiao’s blade shattered into countless fragments, weaving into an impenetrable net of lightning covering more than ten zhang around him.

Thousands of electric rays writhed like serpents, each infused with Xiang Tianxiao’s sword intent—sharp beyond compare—forming a sky-covering, earth-blanketing encirclement.

Huo Xingchen’s eyes widened, his usual reckless expression faltering as shock etched his face.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, standing like an ancient, unyielding iceberg, cold as a blade, calmly watching the incoming swarm of electricity.

Xiang Tianxiao's expression remained serious, but a faint smile crept at the corner of his mouth.

He was certain of victory! No one below the Divine Roaming Realm who was trapped in this lightning net could escape, only to be struck down by his sword intent fused with the power of thunder.

A blinding light flared like daylight, dazzling all. At that moment, Yang Kai’s form suddenly blurred, then vanished without a trace.

The electric rays shattered with a thunderous roar under the storm of True Yuan energy waves.

A giant Seal rapidly enlarged before Xiang Tianxiao’s eyes, obscuring the sky, conjuring an illusion of inescapability. In a breath, the Seal struck his chest.

With a muffled grunt, the Second Lord flew back like a severed kite, his face pale midair, spitting blood.

“Second Lord!” The watching Divine Roaming Realm warriors immediately sensed danger, their expressions changed drastically as they hurried forward to catch the falling Xiang Tianxiao.

The dust settled. Yang Kai seemed never to have moved, still standing calmly with an indifferent expression.

Huo Xingchen’s jaw tingled in bitterness. Suddenly, he realized that the night Yang Kai dealt with him, he had been holding back.

The Xiang Family cultivators wore shocked expressions, their eyes bloodshot with disbelief.

Blood dripped from Xiang Tianxiao’s mouth as he staggered, breaking free from his clan’s support. Frowning deeply, his eyes burned with unwillingness.

Staring blankly at Yang Kai for a long while, the reluctant expression in Xiang Tianxiao’s eyes slowly faded, replaced by a weary, defeated gloom.

He never imagined that in the True Yuan Realm, someone could defeat him so easily! Born a prodigy of the Xiang Family, his aptitude far surpassing Xiang Chu’s, nurtured with great effort by his family, he had nearly reached Divine Roaming Realm at a young age. Given time, his future was boundless.

He had always won in battle, but never suffered such a thorough defeat.

His move hadn’t even disturbed the corner of his opponent’s clothes. This blow seriously wounded his pride.

“Second Lord…” A Fourth Stage Divine Roaming Realm warrior of the Xiang Family, fearing the Second Lord would be broken by the defeat, spoke hastily to console, “Victory and defeat are the lot of soldiers; do not take it to heart.”

Xiang Tianxiao nodded lightly, the despair vanishing in an instant. When he looked at Yang Kai again, his fighting spirit blazed fiercely, eyes burning like fire.

Yang Kai watched silently, amazed by Xiang Tianxiao’s mental fortitude. If given enough time to temper himself, this young lord could surpass some lords of the Eight Great Families in the future.

Qiu Yimeng chuckled happily nearby, but Huo Xingchen shook his head with a sigh, clicking his tongue repeatedly. “Damn, that powerful? How does he cultivate?”

“Qiu Yimeng, arrange for others from Autumn Rain Hall to carry those four chests into my room,” Yang Kai said coldly without another glance at Xiang Tianxiao before turning toward his mansion.

Before leaving, he casually glanced toward a certain direction.

There, two cultivators with power reaching the Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm stiffened with a cold expression.

One of them hesitated, suspiciously asking, “Did that Lord Kai notice us?”

The other was stunned, shaking his head. “Unlikely. We are so well hidden and have shown no hostility. How could he have discovered us?”

“Then why did he glance this way?”

“Strange…” The first one exclaimed in confusion. “Forget it for now. The family head told us to observe Lord Kai’s performance tonight. If he’s defeated, we’ll snatch the Young Master back. The Young Master picks the worst possible ally.”

“Still, Lord Kai’s own strength is extraordinary. I don’t think many newly advanced Divine Roaming Realm cultivators are his match.”

Outside the mansion, Qiu Yimeng smiled warmly as she walked toward the Xiang Family group.

A Fourth Stage Divine Roaming Realm warrior hurriedly bowed respectfully. “Xiang Fei of the Xiang Family, greetings, Miss Qiu.”

At the same time, suspicion flickered on his face. The alliance between the Qiu Family and Yang Shen, the Yang Family’s Sixth Prince, was well-known. But why was the celebrated young lady of the Qiu Family at Yang Kai’s estate? Yang Kai treated her like a household steward, while this famous young lady bore it without resentment, calm and compliant.

Xiang Fei was puzzled.

Xiang Tianxiao slightly bowed in greeting as well.

Qiu Yimeng smiled lightly, “No need for formalities. From now on, we will be working together.”

Xiang Fei nodded. “If Lord Kai has truly defeated our Second Young Master, the Xiang Family will honor its promises. As long as Lord Kai is not defeated in the succession war, we will do our utmost to assist.”

Qiu Yimeng nodded approvingly.

“But Miss Qiu, why is it that you…” Xiang Fei voiced his curiosity.

“I’m his ally,” Qiu Yimeng smiled without further explanation.

Xiang Tianxiao and Xiang Fei were subtly moved. They suddenly realized this unpromising Lord Kai already had two Lords or Ladies from the Eight Great Families as allies—a rare occurrence.

“Let’s all go inside. I’ll arrange things for you,” Qiu Yimeng said with a weary smile. “I didn’t expect to pick up housekeeper duties when I came here.”

Leading the Xiang Family members inside, Huo Xingchen fanned himself, warmly slinging an arm over Xiang Tianxiao’s shoulder. “Brother in hardship! I owe you a drink!”

Xiang Tianxiao replied sullenly, “Fine.”

“Afterward, I’ll take you to Spring Breeze Pleasure Pavilion to celebrate in style!”

“No need.”

…

Light knocks sounded, and Yang Kai raised his eyelids. “Come in.”

The door opened to reveal Qiu Yimeng, her appearance fair and dignified. She entered unceremoniously, pouring herself a cup of tea to soothe her throat. A few from Autumn Rain Hall followed, carrying four large chests that they set inside before bowing and retreating.

Qiu Yimeng remained seated, smiling brightly at Yang Kai. “When did you make the Xiang and Nan families suffer such heavy losses?”

“Around three months after parting from you and Luo Xiaoman.”

“Tell me what happened. I asked the Second Lord Xiang, but even he wasn’t quite sure, only that his Eldest Brother and cousin both hate and fear you. Also, I heard that Nan Sheng from the Nan family was forced to sever two of his own fingers by you. You’re ruthless. That’s an elite family’s lord and the Nan family’s heir!”

“They brought it on themselves,” Yang Kai sneered, frowning as he recounted the situation.

Qiu Yimeng’s eyes glittered, feeling a secret satisfaction, especially imagining those from the Xiang and Nan families humiliated and powerless to fight back.

“That explains why those two families admitted defeat. Attempting to kill a direct Yang Family disciple is a grave offense, especially after the death of your Fourth Prince. If anyone linked these incidents together, the Xiang and Nan families would be finished.”

“Tell me about the Xiang Family, especially about the relationship between Xiang Tianxiao and Xiang Chu,” Yang Kai said, standing to inspect the chests as he casually asked.

“As cunning as a fox!” Qiu Yimeng muttered with a pout.

Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “Xiang Chu clearly didn’t tell his younger brother the full story back then. Otherwise, Xiang Tianxiao wouldn’t have recklessly challenged me today. Even elder brothers keep secrets from their siblings; their relationship is obviously strained. If I can’t see that, I’d be blind.”
