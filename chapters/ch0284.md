## Chapter 284 — A Shocking Change

After trying for more than ten times, Yang Kai finally managed to glimpse a bit of useful information.

It was a spirit formation! Specifically designed to assist in alchemy, this spirit formation could be sealed in an alchemy furnace to enhance the grade and level of the pills produced. However, the effect was not particularly good and was rather unstable.

Having expended a massive amount of Divine Sense and consumed the Wan Yao Ling Milk several times to obtain this little information, Yang Kai couldn't help but furrow his brows.

The effort did not seem to match the reward, giving him a feeling of loss.

The profundity and mystery of this True Alchemy Formula were clearly beyond his current weak Divine Sense, making it impossible for him to comprehend the entirety of it.

Yang Kai felt a bit regretful, slowly putting away the thought of peeking into the True Alchemy Formula, planning to reconsider it once his Divine Sense grew stronger in the future.

He sensed that his Divine Sense had indeed seen some growth after such a long period of tempering, which was a pleasant surprise.

However… how did this True Alchemy Formula end up here? Moreover, why did it surge into his mind in this manner?

If the creator of the black book wanted him to master the True Alchemy Formula, they could have sealed it in a page of the Wordless Black Book, allowing him to unlock it once his strength reached a certain level.

With his current strength, it was impossible for him to accept such vast and intricate information. If it weren't for the assistance of the Warm Spirit Lotus, his soul would have been injured when that information surged in.

Although he couldn't figure this out, he did understand the mystery of the Dan Sheng's relic.

It was said that one could comprehend the way of alchemy from the Dan Sheng's relic, and even Meng Wuya believed there was much to gain from it. Now it seemed that this was not just a rumor.

The mystery within the Dan Sheng's relic was indeed this True Alchemy Formula.

However, those alchemists comprehended it through the relic and gained very little, while Yang Kai had directly absorbed it.

He couldn't help but feel anxious about whether the Dan Sheng's relic would still allow others to comprehend it in the future.

Having taken everything from this place, only a dry well remained.

It was time to leave.

Yang Kai sat quietly for several hours, adjusting his state to its peak before searching for an exit.

He initially thought there must be a hidden passage in this sealed space, but after searching for a long time, he found nothing.

This left him puzzled; how was he supposed to leave without a hidden passage? Should he just go back the way he came? Outside, there were two experts from the Divine Roaming Realm and a large group of True Yuan Realm guards.

Once he jumped out of the Wan Yao Pool, he would likely be captured immediately.

Yang Kai believed that heaven would not completely cut off a person's path.

After carefully searching the secret chamber for a long time, he still found nothing.

Yang Kai's brows furrowed; the current situation felt a bit off. The black book had instructed him to come here to collect the Wan Yao Ling Ye. There was no reason for it to leave him without an escape route.

But why couldn't he find it? Was there some place he had overlooked?

Yang Kai was certain he had searched this place inside and out more than ten times, leaving no inch unexamined.

Half a day later.

He had reached his limit of patience.

Yang Kai concluded that there was no hidden passage here, and if he wanted to get out, he would have to jump out of the Wan Yao Pool.

Wasn't that throwing himself into a net? The Wan Yao Pool was a forbidden ground of the Yao Wang Valley. Even though he was now considered half a disciple of the Hidden Cloud Peak, appearing at the bottom of the Wan Yao Pool would likely lead to a bad outcome.

Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai decided to break through from above. Although there were many guards outside, if he was fast enough, there might still be a chance for survival.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai leaped to the top, reached out, and without any hesitation, punched out.

This punch was merely a test.

The Wan Yao Pool had existed in the Yao Wang Valley for so many years, and many experts must have come down to investigate and attack, trying to find any secrets below.

Those experts could not break through the bottom's blockade due to the formation.

Yang Kai did not think his punch could break through the bottom!

But things turned out to be quite miraculous. With a loud bang, the obstruction above his head suddenly shattered, and the sound of rushing water followed. The water from the Wan Yao Pool poured down upon him.

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly, but he did not hesitate, quickly shooting upward against the torrent of water, fiercely urging his True Yuan, ready to strike.

He was prepared for an ambush and a quick counterattack.

However, unexpectedly, he did not encounter any attacks even when he soared into the air. In a hurry, he turned his head to look around, and his pupils involuntarily constricted.

By the Wan Yao Pool, corpses were strewn about, and blood flowed like a river.

The once towering Dan Sheng's relic, standing thirty zhang tall, was now shattered into pieces, with rubble scattered across the ground.

A thick smell of blood wafted through the air, and the sounds of shouting and killing echoed all around.

Yang Kai's expression darkened suddenly, and he turned back to the ground.

Looking around, he discovered that several hundred zhang away, there were signs of battle everywhere. The twelve peaks of the Yao Wang Valley were shrouded in smoke, and from a high vantage point, he could see the chaos in the valley town below, where people were in disarray.

In the sky, many experts from the Divine Roaming Realm were engaged in fierce battles, unleashing various ferocious martial techniques and bizarre treasures with great power.

Someone was attacking the Yao Wang Valley!

Who was so audacious?

And they chose such a sensitive time during the alchemy conference.

The Yao Wang Valley had a legacy of thousands of years and had never offended any faction, regardless of whether they were righteous or evil, strong or weak. The Yao Wang Valley had always adhered to a principle of neutrality.

Many evil martial artists would also come to the Yao Wang Valley to request alchemy.

It was precisely because of its neutral stance that it had survived for thousands of years.

But now, someone had set their sights on the Yao Wang Valley, committing widespread slaughter and even destroying the Dan Sheng's relic!

This was a shocking change!

The Yao Wang Valley had countless connections with all factions in the world. In the valley town, there were often experts from various factions stationed, and daring to attack the Yao Wang Valley meant that no matter how strong this faction was, they had become the public enemy of the world, not far from annihilation.

However, at this moment, the battle within the Yao Wang Valley was evidently intense. Moreover, it seemed that the Yao Wang Valley was at a disadvantage.

However… the destruction of the Dan Sheng's relic was a loss for the entire world.

Yang Kai vaguely felt that the destruction of the Dan Sheng's relic was closely related to the True Alchemy Formula surging into his mind, after all, that True Alchemy Formula had come from the Dan Sheng's relic.

Standing still for a moment, Yang Kai suddenly reacted and hurriedly activated his movement technique toward the Hidden Cloud Peak.

Dong Qingyan and Xia Ningshang were still there. Elder Xiao and the two defenseless women were also there. Although Meng Wuya was stationed at the Hidden Cloud Peak, who knew how the situation was now?

With a rush, Yang Kai quickly approached the Hidden Cloud Peak, the scenery on both sides retreating rapidly as he spread his Divine Sense. The situation within a radius of several dozen li was clear at a glance.

The overwhelming killing intent and evil energy gathered among the peaks of the Yao Wang Valley, and those fighting against the disciples of the Yao Wang Valley were all filled with evil energy.

They were a group of evil beings! It was just unclear which evil faction they originated from.

Besides these fallen martial artists and the disciples of the Yao Wang Valley, many martial artists from all over the world were fighting. These people were helping the Yao Wang Valley, but there were not many experts among them, and they lacked coordination, suffering continuous defeats and leaving behind a sea of corpses.

A few li away, a patch of green poisonous mist enveloped an area of several hundred zhang. Within that poisonous mist, all the trees and flowers had withered and died, and many martial artists' corpses lay scattered on the ground, their flesh rotting and revealing their stark white bones.

In the sky, many experts from the Divine Roaming Realm were being shot down or killed. Most of these people were experts from various factions, while those filled with evil energy from the Divine Roaming Realm had the upper hand.

Yang Kai's expression darkened. Although he did not know why such a great change had occurred in the Yao Wang Valley, he did not stop his steps.

Just as he was halfway there, a blood-soaked brawny man suddenly jumped out in front of him. This man was holding a bone knife, with a piece of bloody flesh impaled on it.

With a sinister laugh, the brawny man fixed his wolf-like eyes on the rushing Yang Kai, stuffing the piece of flesh into his mouth and chewing it as if it were the most delicious delicacy in the world, a satisfied expression appearing on his face.

Yang Kai glanced down and saw a corpse at the brawny man's feet. This person was not a disciple of the Yao Wang Valley; he should have come from some sect, having died long ago, with a piece of flesh missing from his face.

"Another delicious treat delivered to my door!" the brawny man cackled, his face twisted, and his True Yuan surged violently, exuding waves of evil aura.

True Yuan Realm Fifth Stage!

Yang Kai snorted coldly, his expression fierce. While running, his Divine Sense suddenly surged out, instantly invading the brawny man's mind.

The brawny man's expression froze, his eyes momentarily dazed.

Having never practiced soul techniques, although Yang Kai's Divine Sense was not inferior to experts at the Fourth or Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, he could only use it roughly like this, unable to unleash its full power.

But it was enough.

In the blink of an eye, the brawny man regained his senses. Before he could launch his attack, Yang Kai's fist struck him in the chest.

With a loud crash, the brawny man's body, weighing two hundred jin, flew out like a cannonball, his chest visibly caving in.

In mid-air, the brawny man's body exploded into a mist of blood!

He didn't even have time to mobilize his True Yuan to defend.

Without pausing, Yang Kai shot past like a meteor.

Moments later, he dashed into the Hidden Cloud Peak.

Compared to the other peaks, the number of dead here was the least. After all, this place had always been tranquil, with hardly anyone coming.

However, the battle here was also the fiercest.

Before reaching the peak, Yang Kai looked up to see Meng Wuya in mid-air, fiercely battling a large group of Divine Roaming Realm experts.

Shopkeeper Meng was unfathomable, with methods that reached the heavens, but at this moment, his realm was only at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. He was facing six experts, two of whom had even reached the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, while the remaining four were not weak either, each possessing strength above the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, surpassing the quality of the Blood Battle Gang experts from before.

The seven Divine Roaming Realm experts were engaged in a fierce battle at the top of the Hidden Cloud Peak.

During the battle, one of them shouted, "Which old man is this, so powerful!"

If it were an ordinary peak expert of the Divine Roaming Realm, they would have fallen under the attacks of the six by now, but Meng Wuya was not at a disadvantage, and the martial techniques he unleashed left everyone in shock.
