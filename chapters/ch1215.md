## Chapter 1215 — On the Brink

Worried sick about Xuan'er's safety, the woman had been racing at nearly full speed the whole way; at first she had held back considerably, fearing Yang Kai wouldn't keep up, but when she saw Yang Kai looking so relaxed and at ease she gradually increased her pace — and Yang Kai remained unflinchingly at her side.

But now the other man was actually leading ahead of her.

The sight sent a chill through her — no wonder he could pursue a Spirit Fox through the Flowing Flame Sandland; his current speed was likely not his limit. He was simply traveling unhurriedly to wait for her.

After a moment's hesitation, the woman abruptly said, "Junior Brother..."

"Huh?" Yang Kai turned his head, regarding her with a puzzled look, unsure what she wanted by calling to him; she was two small Stages above him, so addressing him as Junior Brother was not unreasonable.

"If you can go faster, don't hold back for my sake — press on at full speed. I can keep up."

A flash of surprise crossed Yang Kai's eyes — only then did he realize she hadn't been using her full strength either; it seemed that anyone who could reach the Third Stage possessed some concealed means.

He said nothing more, offered a slight nod, then pushed his speed to the limit — his body blurred into a streak as he surged ahead.

Yang Kai refrained from deploying his Wind-and-Thunder Wings; he was certain that if he did, even whatever reserves she had would be left far behind.

A strong wave of Saint Yuan rolled up from behind; whatever method she used, Yang Kai felt her speed spike in an instant and she pressed tightly to his heels.

But after accelerating, her breath abruptly stopped — as if a single inhalation had been trapped in her chest and never exhaled.

A hundred li west of that massive Gangyin ore stone sat a vast lava lake. Its molten waters were nothing but searing lava; the extreme heat warped the very air and landscape, baking everything into twisted shapes. The lava in the lake ran dark red and viscous, enormous bubbles constantly boiled up and burst with popping sounds, and from each ruptured bubble a black mist-like energy welled forth, carrying terribly potent fire toxins and corrosive force.

The entire lava lake presented an apocalyptic spectacle that made the flesh crawl.

Floating at the very center of the lake was a tortoise shell roughly three zhang across. Once earth-yellow, the shell had been baked to an intense crimson by the lava, radiating blistering heat; its surface was split by innumerable fine, spiderweb-like fissures.

Through those cracks the lake's scorching breath seeped inward, mercilessly assailing the band of young men and women who clung to the shell and struggled for breath.

The group were the Yingyue Hall's core disciples: Wei Guchang and Xuan'er were among them, accompanied by two other young men and another woman — five in all.

The shell's surface was not large — just enough for the five of them to stand.

At this moment all five teetered on collapse, faces deathly pale and their Saint Yuan pulses reduced to a near whisper.

Wei Guchang was in the best condition among them, yet even he had lost his former swagger; his face wore bitterness and chagrin, only when his gaze fell upon Xuan'er did a flicker of tenderness and reluctance appear. Every time he saw the woman he loved standing with him through the ordeal some inexplicable strength welled up within him, easing his plight; were it not for that stubborn fixation keeping him upright, he would already have collapsed — and if he fell, the five from Yingyue Hall would certainly be annihilated.

Xuan'er remained gentle and composed; since falling into the formation she had said little, only occasionally offering words of encouragement to her fellows to hold on a little longer — but who would ever guess that this woman in white, always smiling warmly as if she could be content so long as she were with Wei Guchang even under the sky's collapse, had already reached the end of her reserves?

All of it was a pretense. She and Wei Guchang shared the same resolve: not a single flicker of weakness or despondency must be shown before the other three.

If either of them faltered, the situation would only grow worse.

The other three fared far worse: the two male disciples wore faces ashen with despair, their eyes dim as if shrouded by clouds, murmuring incoherently — under the shadow of death their minds had long since frayed and their composure was lost.

The other woman, tall and clad in red, was equally spent; tear tracks lined her cheeks as if she had cried herself dry, mechanically pouring the faint Saint Yuan she could muster into the shell to barely sustain its defenses.

Whether Wei Guchang, Xuan'er, or the other three disciples of Yingyue Hall, they all knew: if no one came to their aid within a day or two, death was certain.

They had been trapped here too long; everyone's Saint Yuan had been drained dry. In such a cursed place they could not run their methods to recover; depending only on Saint Crystals and Pills was simply not enough.

While they had Pills the situation was somewhat manageable, but after those were exhausted a few days ago, no matter how they siphoned energy from Saint Crystals they could not make up their losses.

The lustre on their treasure armor had faded; none of them had the spare Saint Yuan left to sustain their gear.

If it were merely being trapped on a lava lake, Yingyue Hall's five core disciples could have managed — they'd find a way to reach the shore.

What left them helpless was that, no matter how they urged the tortoise shell beneath their feet, it would not budge — as if some mysterious force from the lava lake had bound the five of them fast to that spot.

To make matters worse, the magma lake seemed to be covered by some kind of formation. From time to time, streams of molten lava would gather into violent bursts of power, lashing toward them from all directions. The five of them found themselves in constant peril, but each time the danger peaked, Wei Guchang would erupt with hidden strength, barely managing to keep everyone unharmed.

Yet he himself was covered in wounds and dark-red burn marks; the fire toxin coalesced into a black aura at those injuries. Wei Guchang had no extra strength to purge it, and could only let it slowly gnaw at his vitality and vigor.

Gradually a smear of blackish aura crept across Wei Guchang's pale face, making his condition appear alarmingly poor.

"Senior Brother..." Xuan'er's heart fluttered and she nearly burst into tears. "I'm sorry!"

Wei Guchang forced a grin, speaking with full voice, "What is there for you to apologize for between us? Don't speak like that as if we're strangers."

"But if it weren't for my exploring here, we wouldn't have fallen into this formation!" Xuan'er's beautiful eyes dimmed.

She had noticed something strange about the place and came to investigate; the moment they stepped in the ground fissured crack by crack, the earth suddenly gave way and great sheets of scorching lava burst forth, trapping the five of them at the very center.

Unable to fly, the five could only cling to the tortoise shell they'd just found, barely clinging to life — but escaping that place was out of the question.

Whether the shell had been left after the death of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast no one could say; it was extraordinarily sturdy — even after more than a month baked in the lava lake it had not shattered, only riddled with countless fine cracks.

Yet now the shell looked precarious, as if it might crack to pieces at any moment.

"Don't say that. Where there are gains there are risks — coming here was a decision the five of us made together, it's not your fault," Wei Guchang said steadily. "Had it not been so, we wouldn't have found that valuable thing. Once we get out of here we'll split it evenly; our powers should all grow considerably."

"Can we still get out of here?" the tall woman in red asked, turning her large, tear-brimmed eyes to Wei Guchang. "Senior Brother Gu and Junior Sister Liu died back when we first entered the Third Layer... could their resentful spirits be taking revenge on us for not saving them?"

At her words the two male disciples' faces turned ashen; recalling what had happened over a month before drained what little color remained from their cheeks.

Wei Guchang shot her a cold glance and said in a low voice, "Junior Brother Gu and Junior Sister Liu were killed by a Fire Spirit Beast. It wasn't that we didn't try to save them — we were powerless. Fate struck and could not be avoided. Our misfortune has nothing to do with them — don't dwell on it."

The deaths of those two had cast a heavy shadow over the minds of the others; before entering the Flowing Flame Sandland each of them had been brimming with confidence. As core disciples they were gifted and strong, each believing the sandland held nothing remarkable and that with their abilities they could harvest great gains and ascend overnight.

While they had roamed the First and Second Layers with ease and encountered little danger, upon entering the Third Layer they had already lost two comrades!

Those who had once lived and trained alongside them — companions with whom they had joked a moment before — had so cruelly perished before their very eyes; who could remain unmoved by that?

Though Wei Guchang despised such defeatism, he could understand his fellow disciples' feelings and thus refrained from harsh rebuke.

If he had been locked away in the Sect like the others, incessantly cultivating behind closed doors, he would not have developed such psychological endurance; truly, only flowers and plants that weather the wind and rain grow hardy. Those so-called elite disciples had shone brightly within the Sect, each a favored child worshipped by countless juniors and cuttingly skilled in sparring, but once out here their flaws were exposed. If there were a chance to return, he would speak to the master and Elder Qian — if the Yingyue Hall's disciples carried on like this, the next generation would surely see them destroyed, Wei Guchang resolved inwardly.
