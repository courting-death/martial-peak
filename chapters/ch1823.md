## Chapter 1823 — This Sect Master Guarantees He Won't Beat You to Death

It was obvious that Xia Ningshang was not corporeal but a manifested strand of soul, able only to produce a vague apparition; at this moment her clear eyes were full of anxiety and helplessness, with a hint of anger.

In contrast, the middle-aged man and the several Origin Returning Realm cultivators all wore airs of calm certainty, as if they had the other side completely trapped.

The two sides seemed to be in a standoff. After a long while, the middle-aged man finally spoke, "I have waited many days—Miss Xia, have you come to a decision? Can you give me a satisfactory answer?"

Xia Ningshang knit her brows and said softly, "Could you grant me a little more time? This matter is of great consequence; I need to discuss it carefully with my Junior Brother, but at present I cannot find his whereabouts."

The middle-aged man snorted coldly. "Miss Xia, are you joking? I saw you, so young, yet able to refine a Stellar Origin—so I admired your talent and chose not to use force. But you have stalled repeatedly; do you take me for a fool? If you truly had urgent matters, you should consult your master, not your Junior Brother. How absurd!"

Xia Ningshang thought inwardly that her master’s current cultivation was inferior even to hers; how could he possibly be superior to her Junior Brother?

"No more excuses." The middle-aged man cut her off with extreme impatience. "Since you refuse to cooperate, I will drain this continent’s Spiritual Qi in short order and turn it into a Dead Star! As for that Stellar Origin—if you won't hand it over, I don't want it either. I want to see how long you can preserve your Origin without the support of Spiritual Qi! Or perhaps you think you can revive it? Heh. This continent harbors millions upon millions of lives… without the nourishment of Spiritual Qi, they will soon become nothing but bones."

"Wait!" Xia Ningshang cried out in alarm, her face full of hesitation and despair.

The middle-aged man sneered at her, his expression resolute.

Although he hadn’t interacted much with this woman surnamed Xia, he could tell she was inexperienced in the ways of the world, lacking in both knowledge and experience. Her heart was kind, unwilling to watch this continent slowly fall into ruin—and it was precisely because of that kindness that he had been able to threaten her into returning the Origin.

Otherwise, the Origin’s power would already have been refined by her. Only by finding and killing her true body could he seize the Stellar Origin she possessed.

But where her true body was, the middle-aged man had no clue; she had only sensed the troubles on the continent and descended as a strand of soul. Only a great divine art could follow that Divine Sense and trace Xia Ningshang’s true body’s location.

Seeing Xia Ningshang in such distress, the middle-aged man knew his threat had taken effect—pressing millions of lives down upon her like a weight. How could a lone woman possibly endure it? He pressed the advantage: "Miss Xia, I do not wish to act with inhuman cruelty. If you place the Origin in my hands and I refine it, I will become this place’s Star Lord; if I am Star Lord, would I not consider the continent's welfare?"

"But…aren't you already drawing off the Spiritual Qi?" Xia Ningshang did not fully comprehend the domineering evil of the Spirit-Devouring Array and could not immediately perceive the scheme behind their intentions.

"Destruction before construction." The middle-aged man smiled faintly. "The specific reasons are inconvenient to tell you; you need only know that if I refine the Origin, I will lead this continent to prosperity and glory."

"Is that truly so?" Xia Ningshang murmured; though she was naturally kind and simple of heart, she was not a fool—she had already discerned the middle-aged man was no good, yet his threats struck at her weak point.

If she refused to return the Origin and allow him to refine it, the continent’s Spiritual Qi would sooner or later be exhausted; then it would truly become a Dead Star.

In her days as a Star Lord she had felt the life and pulse of millions upon millions on the Tongxuan Continent and had endured its rises and falls—how could she bear to watch the land turn into a cold wasteland?

Xia Ningshang was at her wits’ end; deep inside only one voice cried out: Junior Brother, where are you? If you stood here in my stead, what would you do?

"Little Senior Sister, don't listen to his lies!" A voice suddenly echoed from the depths of the planet's core.

Xia Ningshang sharply raised her head and, thinking at first she had imagined it from longing, nearly dismissed it as a hallucination—but when a familiar figure stepped slowly out of the darkness nearby and she saw the familiar smile on that face, she realized her Junior Brother had truly appeared at such a time.

Xia Ningshang’s mouth twitched and she nearly wept, overwhelmed with misery.

In the days prior she had been bargaining with the middle-aged man; her fragile, sensitive heart had borne unimaginable pressure while she pretended calm. But when that figure appeared, she felt as if she might collapse—the burden that had weighed on her shoulders threatened to crush her. Only when it was lifted did she realize the full extent of what she had carried.

"Junior Brother!" Xia Ningshang pursed her lips and called.

"Senior Sister, don't cry!" Yang Kai flickered forward and stood before the strand of her soul, fixing his gaze on her and grinning, "It's all right, it's all right—I’m here."

He comforted her like one soothing a child, barely restraining himself from ruffling her hair.

Xia Ningshang nodded obediently.

"You sensed something was wrong and sent your soul here, didn't you?" Yang Kai took in the situation at a glance; only a Star Lord could do such a thing. If he wished, he could send a strand of soul back to the Dark Star, though it would cost him greatly. "If the true body is too far from the soul, lingering too long will cause damage. Go back and tell them I will return to the Sect soon—let them not worry."

"Mm, Junior Brother, you be careful. These people…"

"No problem, just a bunch of trash not even worth mentioning." Yang Kai sneered.

Hearing him, Xia Ningshang smiled sweetly, worry gone, and made a spirit hand sign; her manifested visage of soul gradually dispersed.

Just as Xia Ningshang was about to leave, she suddenly seemed to remember something and hurriedly spoke, "Oh, Junior Brother, Yang Yan—she…"

"What's wrong with Yang Yan?" Yang Kai was startled, but Xia Ningshang’s trace was already gone; her strand of soul had already pierced the Starry Sky and returned to the Dark Star.

“What on earth happened?” Yang Kai grew frustrated at once. Xia Ningshang didn’t know Yang Yan’s true identity, but he did. Ever since returning from the Imperial Garden, Yang Yan had remained in deep slumber, seemingly attempting to fully merge her true body with her Incarnation. More than ten years had passed since then, and he still had no idea how she was faring. Now Xia Ningshang suddenly sent word about Yang Yan, yet without explaining clearly — it made Yang Kai unbearably anxious.

“I’ll deal with you properly once we’re back!” Yang Kai thought in his mind, furious.

"Kid, you are arrogant indeed, daring to speak of me so boldly." Since Yang Kai had appeared the middle-aged man and the Origin Returning Realm cultivators had watched him warily; just now Yang Kai had called them a bunch of trash, and their anger flared.

On top of that, the Stellar Origin Power that had nearly fallen into his grasp was ruined by just a few words from Yang Kai — how could the middle-aged man possibly endure that? He roared in fury on the spot.

Yang Kai slowly turned and looked at them with cold eyes, sneering, "What? Aren't you trash? A few grown men teaming up to bully a girl—calling you trash insults the word 'trash'!"

The middle-aged man let out a cold snort, murderous intent surging in his eyes so thick it seemed almost tangible.

"Who was it just now that said they'd turn this place into a Dead Star? Stand up—this Sect Master guarantees I won't beat you to death!" Yang Kai acted with unbounded swagger, glaring down at them.

"Kid, don't think a little strength lets you run rampant. A frog at the bottom of a well knows not the vastness of the sea. You're young and have attained the Void King Realm—you're a promising talent. Why not join me? I can teach you supremes techniques and help you reach the pinnacle sooner." The middle-aged man folded his hands behind his back and spoke in a sonorous tone, attempting the posture of a sect leader.

"What, Void King Realm?"

"Him?"

"Impossible."

The Origin Returning Realm cultivators behind the middle-aged man were astonished, each calling out in surprise; they had been probing Yang Kai’s cultivation but could find no clue. They had assumed he wore a Secret Treasure that blocked Divine Sense, but never imagined the truth was that his power exceeded theirs.

But… could there really be such a young Void King Realm cultivator in the world?

Yang Kai chuckled and looked down on them, "Are you all from the Devouring Spirit Sect so stupid? No wonder your sect was wiped out."

The middle-aged man's eyelids tightened. "You know we're from the Devouring Spirit Sect and still dare to be so bold?"

The Origin Returning Realm men trembled as if their secrets had been exposed, their eyes filling with deep dread.

“So what if I’m arrogant? Go on, bite me then!” Yang Kai sneered. “If you don’t have the balls for it, want me to lend you some?”

The middle-aged man trembled with anger but dared not act rashly. He had already seen that Yang Kai possessed First Stage of the Void King Realm power and was not inferior to him; he had no confidence in killing Yang Kai, so he had tolerated his insolence.

But if the Devouring Spirit Sect’s secret were exposed, it might well draw the wrath of cultivators across the entire Star Domain.

For a time the middle-aged man’s head spun, not knowing what to do.

Yang Kai saw his hesitation and sneered, pouring salt on the wound: "By the way, before coming here I killed a few of your Devouring Spirit Sect people; one claimed to be your Young Sect Master, calling himself Mu Chengfeng—he was the one you call your son, wasn't he… Sect Master Mu Wu?"

Mu Wu’s body jolted and his eyes flashed blood-red. "You killed Chengfeng?"

"Wrong, my bad." Yang Kai feigned apology with a smile. "I didn't kill him—I only beat him up. No, he was stomped to death by people from Tianmu Palace; he died horribly, a bloody mess. Sect Master Mu Wu, you weren't there—if you had seen it, you would have wept, tsk tsk…"
