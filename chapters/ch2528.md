## Chapter 2528 — Gathering the Medicine Garden

Refining the Blood Frenzy Pill was not difficult; the challenge lay in gathering the ingredients, as every required material was an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herb, and many were quite rare and hard to find.

Back then, Gao Xueting had only managed to collect the ingredients for the Blood Frenzy Pill by sheer luck. She found an Imperial-Grade Alchemist in the Shrine to refine a batch, but unfortunately, only one pill was produced, and it was a Lower-Level one at that.

Now, Yang Kai had produced an Upper-Level Blood Frenzy Pill in a single attempt, making its value incomparable.

Glancing at the medicinal dregs on the ground, Gao Xueting immediately understood that Yang Kai must have refined many batches and selected the best one to give her.

"Elder Gao, you should just throw away your old Blood Frenzy Pill. That thing is absolutely unsafe to consume," Yang Kai said seriously.

Gao Xueting nodded, took out the jade bottle containing the Blood Frenzy Pill from her Spatial Ring, poured out the pill, and shattered it into powder with a shake of her hand. She then placed the one refined by Yang Kai back into the bottle and looked at him, saying, "Are you satisfied now?"

Yang Kai grinned mischievously, waggling his eyebrows. “If Elder Gao ever wants to refine another Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pill, just come find me. Your disciple’s alchemy skills are top-notch—I’ll even give you a twenty percent discount!”

Gao Xueting laughed and said, “You’re an Emperor now. Don’t go learning Wen’s shameless habits, or you’ll end up a joke.”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. “So Elder Gao has always thought of Hall Master Wen as a laughingstock…”

Gao Xueting snorted softly, then changed the subject as she looked around, "I see there are still some Spiritual Herbs left in this garden. Why haven’t you collected them? What are you leaving them for?"

After speaking, she seemed to recall something and suddenly understood, "I get it now. Alchemists usually leave some behind as seeds when harvesting Spiritual Herbs, right?"

Yang Kai replied, "That’s the usual practice, but only for immature Spiritual Herbs. This garden has existed for many years, and all the Spiritual Herbs here are fully mature and ready to be picked."

"Then why leave some behind?" Gao Xueting asked, puzzled.

Yang Kai smiled bitterly, "These Spiritual Herbs can’t be moved. Some of them, once picked, lose their Spiritual Qi in a very short time, no matter how well they’re preserved, and turn into withered grass. So, when these are needed, they must be freshly harvested. Some of the materials you collected earlier are of this type."

Gao Xueting was startled and quickly checked her Spatial Ring. Soon, she took out two Spiritual Herbs that had lost much of their Spiritual Qi and said regretfully, "It’s true."

These two Spiritual Herbs were ones she had picked here earlier, but after just over a day, their medicinal properties had faded so much. If another two or three days passed, they would likely become nothing but withered grass.

"Isn’t it a pity about these Spiritual Herbs?" Gao Xueting said, looking at the more than twenty still left in the garden. Each one was extremely precious.

"It’s not a big deal," Yang Kai replied with a faint, insincere smile.

The other Spiritual Herbs could be left here if they couldn’t be picked. If needed in the future, they could always come back.

Only the Life Origin Fruit tree made Yang Kai truly reluctant to leave.

On the Life Origin Fruit tree, three tiny blossoms had already bloomed. No one could say how many years it would take for new fruit to appear, but such treasures were all but extinct in the world. To have the tree right before his eyes, yet be unable to take it away, made Yang Kai feel unbearably restless.

However, with his Small Xuan Realm, if handled properly, there was a good chance he could take the entire medicine garden. But with Gao Xueting still present, he needed to send her away first.

"If Elder feels everything is settled, let’s head out. Junior Sister Lu Wen is still waiting outside," Yang Kai suggested.

"Alright."

With that, the two went to the entrance. Yang Kai waved his hand, sending out several Emperor Yuan strikes to lift the restriction, and left the place with Gao Xueting.

As they stepped outside, a heavy stench of blood immediately assaulted their senses. Scattered across the desolate wilderness lay several corpses, limbs twisted and bodies mangled, each one meeting a grisly and tragic end.

Gao Xueting was startled, fearing an ambush outside.

But upon closer inspection, she saw two women standing quietly. One was about twenty, unfamiliar, but despite her youth, she possessed the powerful cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. The other was Lu Wen, a disciple of the Shrine, though she seemed frightened, her pretty face pale.

Seeing Gao Xueting and Yang Kai appear, both women’s eyes lit up and they hurried over.

"Elder Gao!" Lu Wen called out, her eyes full of joy as her face regained its color.

Zhang Ruoxi smiled gently, "Sister Lu, you can relax now. With Sir’s help, there’s no problem."

Lu Wen forced a smile, "Thank you, Senior Brother Yang, for your help."

Yang Kai replied, "Junior Sister Lu, you’re too polite. I’m also a Shrine disciple. When an elder is in trouble, it’s my duty to help."

Gao Xueting said, "No matter what, we truly owe you this time. Otherwise, I..."

She couldn’t help but shiver, recalling the danger earlier and still feeling a bit afraid.

Shaking her head, she said softly, "Now that things are settled, I plan to return to the Shrine. Lu Wen, come with me."

Lu Wen’s face lit up and she quickly replied, "Yes!"

Though she had been sent by the Shrine to gather information in the Eastern Territory, she often missed her fellow disciples and familiar sights.

Now that Gao Xueting was taking her back, she was overjoyed.

"What about you, Yang Kai?" Gao Xueting turned to him.

Since Yang Kai was in the Eastern Territory, he must have things to do, so she didn’t ask if he wanted to return to the Southern Territory with her.

As expected, Yang Kai shook his head, "I still have somewhere to go, to find a friend."

Gao Xueting nodded, "Be careful. Though you’re now an Emperor and seem strong, there are many talented people in this world, and not everyone is as simple as they appear."

"I’ll remember," Yang Kai replied respectfully.

"If you have time... come visit the Shrine. You’re still a registered disciple, after all."

"I will."

He definitely planned to return to Qingyang Shrine, since he still needed to use the Divine Roaming Mirror and fulfill his promise to Tian Yan.

The fragrance lingered, but the people were already gone.

A hundred li away, Lu Wen looked at Gao Xueting in confusion, "Elder, with Senior Brother Yang’s strength, why is he only a registered disciple of the Shrine?"

With the strength Yang Kai had just displayed, he was more than qualified to be an elder of any Sect. Lu Wen had always assumed Yang Kai, like Xia Sheng and Xiao Baiyi, was one of the Shrine’s top disciples. She never expected that he was only a registered disciple.

Gao Xueting thought for a moment, "Because he didn’t join the Shrine willingly. That Qingyang gold token was something I forced on him."

"Ah..." Lu Wen was stunned.

...

On the wilderness, in front of the small world’s entrance, Yang Kai watched Gao Xueting and Lu Wen leave, then took out the Myriad Beasts Seal and tossed it to Zhang Ruoxi, "Refine this for now and use it."

Zhang Ruoxi took it, examined it carefully, and was overjoyed, "Thank you, Sir, for this treasure!"

Yang Kai had never given her any treasures before. Liu Yan, Hua Qingsi, and Incarnation each had an Imperial Treasure from him, and though Zhang Ruoxi never said anything, she had always hoped for one.

She also knew Yang Kai wouldn’t favor one over another; it was just that he hadn’t found a suitable one for her yet.

She hadn’t expected him to give her one so soon.

It didn’t matter if it was a strange-looking seal or even just a lump of iron—if it was a gift from Yang Kai, it was a treasure in her eyes.

Turning the Myriad Beasts Seal over in her hands, Zhang Ruoxi’s face bloomed with a smile, liking it more and more.

Yang Kai glanced at her, "Your violent aura seems quite strong. Next time you fight, try to control it a bit."

Zhang Ruoxi stuck out her tongue, "I don’t know why, but whenever I fight, it’s like I become someone else. Earlier, Sister Lu Wen seemed really scared..."

Lu Wen’s pale face earlier wasn’t because she couldn’t handle the blood; she’d fought and killed before. That kind of scene wouldn’t frighten her. She was scared because of Zhang Ruoxi.

Yang Kai couldn’t understand it. At such a tender age, how could Zhang Ruoxi possess such fierce, violent aura? If that kind of presence were found on a hardened butcher steeped in bloodshed, it wouldn’t be strange at all—but appearing on Zhang Ruoxi, it was deeply unsettling.

The only explanation he could think of was Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline.

If he ever saw Duan Hongchen again, he’d have to ask about it. Otherwise, that violent aura might affect Zhang Ruoxi’s temperament in the future, and if she became a merciless demon, it would be tragic.

"Sir, where are we going now?" Zhang Ruoxi asked.

"Nowhere yet. Let me finish things here first."

As he spoke, Yang Kai opened the entrance to the small world again, grabbed Zhang Ruoxi, and led her inside.

In this ancient medicine garden, aside from the more than twenty Spiritual Herbs Yang Kai had left behind, there was nothing else, though the Spiritual Qi was extremely rich.

After entering, Yang Kai let Zhang Ruoxi find a place to rest while he headed straight for the two innermost medicine gardens.

After looking around for a while, Yang Kai had a plan in mind.

Next, he formed a hand seal, his Emperor Yuan surging, and sent waves of power into the ground, which quickly disappeared.

Though his movements were swift, Yang Kai was extremely careful, as if afraid of damaging something.

He worked for a full hour. Even though he was now an Emperor, he was drenched in sweat, clearly exhausted.

But the preliminary work was done, and the rest would be easier.

He sat cross-legged for a while to recover, then stood up again.

His Divine Sense surged out like a tide, enveloping the two medicine gardens. Then, Yang Kai stomped his foot and shouted, "Rise!"

Rumble— The entire small world shook, and under a tremendous force, the two medicine gardens slowly rose.
