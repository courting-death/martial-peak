## Chapter 1913 — Won't Shed Tears Without Seeing the Coffin

That day, the entire Shuitian City had erupted; the Great Dao Pill Tone drifted through the whole city, and countless children at play froze in place when they heard it, their innocent faces adopting thoughtful looks as they tilted their heads to listen to that distant sound, refusing to move even when their parents tugged at them, as if some expert had cast a tremendously powerful spell upon them.

Many people, however, did not understand what was happening — why there were sounds suddenly ringing in their ears; they thought they were suffering from auditory hallucinations, and even covering their ears proved useless.

Only when numerous warriors of the Hengluo Commerce Guild and the guard forces of Shuitian City mobilized did the city's residents realize that something major had occurred.

Xue Yue, the Third Young Master, decreed that all who had heard that distant heavenly sound—regardless of age or gender—could join the Hengluo Commerce Guild and enjoy exceedingly generous privileges. In particular, children under ten would receive such lavish benefits that many Origin Returning Realm warriors could only look on with envy.

An annual stipend of five hundred thousand Saint Crystals, sole occupancy of a palace, twenty attendants to serve them, and status equivalent to a Commerce Guild Deacon...

Only then did people realize that the inexplicable voice in their ears was in fact a heaven-bestowed opportunity.

Such sudden advantages left the children's parents dazed; coupled with Third Young Master Xue Yue's character and the Hengluo Commerce Guild's reputation, countless men and women grabbed their children and headed straight for the center of Shuitian City.

No one was willing to give up such a benefit delivered to their mouths.

The Great Dao Pill Tone continued to hum, sounding nine times in succession!

This state persisted for a full day.

A day later, on the ninth level of the Medicine Master Hall over a hundred alchemists had already sat cross‑legged, centered on where Yang Kai sat, surrounding him like stars circling the moon.

Many of the alchemists who had not seated themselves also wore thoughtful expressions; their faces shifted constantly, sometimes anxious over gains and losses, sometimes uneasy, sometimes erupting in ecstatic laughter.

Obviously, they had all obtained some benefit!

After the nine tolls, no further sound came from inside the Purple Void Cauldron; the lingering purple qi gradually dissipated.

Yang Kai had long since stopped his pill retrieval. Half a day earlier he had once more settled cross‑legged, closed his eyes, and allowed the Great Dao Pill Tone emanating from within the Purple Void Cauldron to wash over him.

He had gained far more than any alchemist present. After all, that Great Dao Pill Tone had been drawn forth by him; what sounded ephemeral and trace-like to others was crystal clear to Yang Kai.

In the dimness, an ancient and desolate voice had echoed at his ear, instructing him in the profound mysteries of pillcraft. The voice was not loud, but its enunciation was clear.

Each sentence, each word, imprinted itself on Yang Kai's mind like a brand, allowing him to comprehend without effort.

What he obtained surpassed reading the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy a million times.

The alchemical knowledge poured into his mind was the ultimate secret nurtured by heaven and earth; only by provoking the Great Dao Pill Tone could one catch even a glimpse of it.

Of the more than five hundred alchemists, over a hundred sat cross‑legged, nearly half were pensive, and the remainder sighed in frustration — their opportunities had been insufficient, their comprehension lacking, and they had not heard anything from the nine tolls.

But now, looking at Yang Kai, their expressions and demeanors had changed; the earlier dissatisfaction and scorn had vanished, replaced by solemnity and respect.

Who would still say he was not an alchemist if a person could draw forth the Great Dao Pill Tone and make it sound nine times?

Although Yang Kai had not yet opened the furnace to retrieve a pill, they were all convinced there was already a Taichu Soul‑Returning Pill inside that furnace.

This man was not only a Second Stage of the Void King Realm warrior, he was also a genuine master alchemist! Considering their own previous shortsightedness, countless alchemists felt ashamed.

"Why wasn't I included?" an ill-timed voice suddenly cried out. The alchemists who were still clear-headed frowned and turned toward the sound, discovering the speaker to be Zhan Yuan, who had earlier opposed Yang Kai.

Zhan Yuan's face went utterly deranged as he repeatedly swept his gaze over the alchemists seated cross‑legged on the ground, muttering nonstop, "How could I be left out? I heard it too — why wasn't I allowed to hear it clearly? I, Zhan Yuan, am a once‑in‑ten‑thousand‑years alchemical prodigy, self‑taught since youth — how could the secrets of the Pill Dao exclude me?"

Hearing his arrogant words, many alchemists displayed looks of disgust.

Not hearing the Great Dao Pill Tone was a matter of fate and insight — it couldn't be forced. It was Heaven's choice, beyond mortal control, and Zhan Yuan's loud‑mouthed boasting naturally earned him their dislike.

"It's impossible I'm excluded!" Zhan Yuan suddenly snarled, his face contorted as he turned to Yang Kai and spat, "I know now — it must be your doing. You provoked the Great Dao Pill Tone, you obstructed the tone; it's definitely you!"

As he spoke, he charged straight at Yang Kai.

Of the more than five hundred alchemists present, over a hundred had settled cross‑legged and another hundred‑odd sat lost in thought—almost a perfect fifty‑fifty split—yet Zhan Yuan had received nothing; he was on the verge of collapse.

How could such a great opportunity fall to others and not to him?

If one could obtain this chance, one might possibly rise to become a Void King-Grade alchemist in the future.

Thus he could not restrain the fury in his heart.

"Presumptuous!" a deep rebuke thundered beside Zhan Yuan's ear. Ai Ou spoke and waved his hand toward Zhan Yuan, sending him flying like a torn burlap sack.

Because so many alchemists were in the midst of epiphany, Ai Ou did not go too far; he kept his actions suppressed, even conveying that rebuke by condensing Saint Yuan and sending it into Zhan Yuan's ear.

Zhan Yuan flew far and fell heavily to the ground.

"If you dare be noisy and rude again, I'll take your life!" Ai Ou glared coldly at Zhan Yuan, showing no regard for the fact that he was Master Zuo De's disciple.

In his view, the alchemists in the Medicine Master Hall were extraordinarily precious assets; there was no room for Zhan Yuan's disturbances.

Moreover, the one Zhan Yuan had disrupted was Yang Kai, the man who had drawn forth the Great Dao Pill Tone; had the time and place been different, Ai Ou would have had murderous intent.

After that, Zhan Yuan finally came to himself, cold sweat trickling down his forehead; he could not believe he had acted so. Facing Ai Ou's icy gaze, his heart fell — he knew that with his recent conduct he would never again gain Chairman Ai Ou's favor.

However... since he was the disciple of his benefactor, he felt he need not concern himself with Chairman Ai Ou.

Thinking so, Zhan Yuan steadied himself and turned to look at Zuo De.

The next moment he was horrified and cried out, "Teacher, what's wrong with you?"

He found Zuo De standing there, swaying and pale, more exhausted than when he had refined a Taichu Soul‑Returning Pill, as if all his energy had been drained.

"Grandfather, are you all right?" Zuo Ling at last noticed Zuo De's abnormal condition and felt alarmed.

"Master..." Ai Ou stepped forward, staring at Zuo De in surprise, unable to understand what had befallen him; after all, he was a Void King-Grade alchemist who should have gained from the nine tolls, and even if he had not, he should not appear as if attacked — not only was his face sullen, blood was even seeping from his ears.

Zuo De did not move or speak; only his breathing showed that he was still alive.

"Master, I advise you not to question the benefit of the Great Dao Pill Tone; to doubt it is to doubt the Heavenly Dao and the path you have walked. If you do so, the Dao of Alchemy will reject you and the consequences will be grave," Yang Kai's voice suddenly sounded.

As soon as he finished speaking, Zuo De suddenly let out a wail and spat a mouthful of black blood; his spirit withered abruptly, and he looked at Yang Kai with eyes full of unwillingness.

"What's wrong with Master...?" Ai Ou asked, frowning.

"He is unwilling," Yang Kai smiled faintly. "The Master likely believes I have no right to draw forth this Great Dao Pill Tone, so he resents it — and the Pill Tone taught him a lesson."

"A lesson...?" Ai Ou opened his mouth wide, his face going pale. "Don't tell me that the Pill Tone is alive."

"The Heavenly Dao is fickle; how could I ever be certain?" Yang Kai chuckled.

Ai Ou looked thoroughly dejected.

"You dare harm my grandfather!" Zuo Ling suddenly glared at Yang Kai, a faint movement of Saint Yuan stirring within her.

Yang Kai's face turned cold. "Little girl, you may eat carelessly, but you must not speak carelessly; Master Zuo De was not harmed by me."

"Then why did Grandfather... vomit blood!" Zuo Ling demanded stubbornly.

Yang Kai sneered. "That's a question for him. The Great Dao Pill Tone poured into one's ears — if one does not take the time to truly comprehend and yet dares to question the authenticity of the tone, it's a miracle one didn't die on the spot. Consider yourself fortunate. What more do you want?"

Zuo Ling seemed about to retort, but Zuo De raised a hand to stop her; his eyes, dim and lifeless, fixed on Yang Kai as he said, "You are very good!"

"Master, you flatter me!" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"But... have you forgotten there is still a wager between us? You did provoke the Great Dao Pill Tone, but so what? Have you refined the Taichu Soul‑Returning Pill?" Zuo De asked.

"Master wishes to take a peek?" Yang Kai looked at him with a smile.

"Open the furnace!" Zuo De drew a deep breath and said in a low voice, "To provoke the Great Dao Pill Tone indicates you possess heaven‑defying alchemical aptitude, but that does not mean you can refine the Taichu Soul‑Returning Pill. That is a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill! In this world countless prodigies are born, yet how many truly grow to maturity?"

"You won't cry until seeing the coffin," Yang Kai sneered.

"Master, perhaps this wager should end here," an alchemist suggested.

Yang Kai's drawing forth of the Great Dao Pill Tone had been a benefit to them all, and Zuo De was venerated as a model in the alchemical world; such a contest, regardless of outcome, was not something they wished to see, so the best course was to end it and let the matter drop.

One person persuaded, then two, and soon many alchemists had joined the chorus urging reconciliation.

Yang Kai said indifferently, "I have no objections; I'll leave it to the Master."
