## Chapter 703 — Earthfire Core

Although on Tongxuan Continent countless martial artists have come and gone over the years searching for hidden Small Xuan Realms, there still remain many undiscovered places; these Small Xuan Realms are untouched virgin lands, and they very well may conceal staggering wealth.

The alchemist before them and his companion had evidently been exceptionally fortunate to have found such a space.

This drew envious looks from the crowd.

Before long another middle-aged man approached, and at the alchemist's call his companion began drawing rare, aged medicinal ingredients out of a Spatial Pouch in an endless stream.

Each item pulled out immediately triggered a scramble among the onlookers.

Those who came to this trading area seeking medicinal materials generally had a more discerning eye and naturally would not miss such a golden opportunity.

The scene was boisterous and explosive; one of the alchemist pair sold the materials while the other collected Crystal Stones, both busier than could be imagined.

The two looked honest and straightforward, and rather than seizing the chance to price-gouge they sold at slightly above market value—an increase buyers were willing to accept.

Yang Kai watched closely but did not rush to act.

Although all the materials were fine, none of them were what he needed.

Suddenly the alchemist’s companion produced an orb the color of blazing red fire, round as a rolling flame, and the moment it appeared the air around it grew scorching; everyone felt the extraordinary, fierce medicinal force emanating from it, and on its surface dense, vein-like networks had formed, like human meridians.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened. He moved quickly!

At the same time, many who knew the value reached out their palms, and in an instant a dozen large hands lunged toward the fiery materia.

Fei Yu stayed silent, lightly stamping her foot; an invisible shockwave spread outward from her like a sudden wind.

The hidden burst from a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm expert knocked those competing against Yang Kai off balance, forcing them to stagger backward.

Caught in the bustle, Yang Kai and Fei Yu exchanged a glance and revealed a knowing smile.

In the next moment Yang Kai’s hand closed on the fire-red spherical materia, but to his surprise another hand had seized the opposite side.

Among those present only Yang Kai and the other person had not been affected by Fei Yu’s aura.

Yang Kai looked up toward the owner of the hand, astonishment on his face; Fei Yu made a soft sound of surprise as well.

It turned out to be the young man who had just bought the Ice Heart Snow Lotus with ten Saint Pills; the youth glanced at Yang Kai and bared a smile.

Once everyone regained their footing, they all looked at Fei Yu with both caution and vexation; but upon seeing such a beautiful woman their anger quickly ebbed.

“Heh heh, this will be entertaining,” someone sneered at the sight of Yang Kai and the young man squabbling.

The crowd watched with strange expressions, guessing who would have the last laugh and to whom this precious material would ultimately belong.

“Friend, what a coincidence.” The young man smiled faintly at Yang Kai, showing a row of white teeth that flashed a little too brightly.

“Indeed.” Yang Kai smiled as well, lifting an eyebrow. “You want this too?”

“Like I said, everyone wants something good.”

“With so many fine things here, there’s no need to fight me for the same one,” Yang Kai said amicably, trying to persuade him to yield.

The youth shook his head slowly. “Those items are fine, but they’re not what I want. I want this Earthfire Core.”

“Hm, same as me.”

“Then what do we do?” The young man frowned, not expecting this, and asked the seller, “Shopkeeper, do you have another Earthfire Core?”

The seller shook his head slowly. “Only this one. It took both of us tremendous effort to retrieve it from a thousand zhang beneath the earth.”

A Earthfire Core is only generated where subterranean flames exist, and even then only with a very small chance; it is called the gallbladder of the earthfire, gathering all the quintessence and essence of the underground flames, with innumerable wondrous uses.

For Yang Kai to refine the Saint Pill that would save the Ancient Demon Clan he absolutely needed an Earthfire Core; he did not know what the young man intended, but judging from his demeanor the youth would not let go easily.

“Hey, lighten up, put less force into it or you’ll destroy the Earthfire Core.” The young man’s expression changed; sensing Yang Kai’s determination he found the situation awkward.

“Same to you!” Yang Kai smiled faintly, then pondered before saying, “You just bought that Ice Heart Snow Lotus for such an expensive sum—today you’ve already profited, why press on to fight me for this Earthfire Core?”

“Let’s keep things separate.” The young man shook his head. “Fine, if you step back I’ll compensate your losses—pay you the price of this Earthfire Core, how’s that?”

Yang Kai shook his head firmly and said coldly, “If you yield, I can compensate you too.”

“Heh heh!” The young man gave an awkward laugh, his face full of helplessness.

“You two arguing like this makes it hard for me to do business; can you hurry and decide who’s buying?” the seller urged, clearly embarrassed.

“Wait a moment, let me see if I can persuade this friend.” The young man replied bluntly.

But before he could finish, someone suddenly burst out from the crowd, casting a disdainful glare around him; he boldly thrust out a hand toward the Earthfire Core and declared, “You don’t need to fight—this Earthfire Core belongs to me, Young Master Nie.”

Yang Kai and the young man’s expressions changed at once; both had already exerted considerable force to seize the Earthfire Core, reaching the critical limit it could bear, and if this newcomer added any more strength it would be destroyed.

Before his hand could reach it, Yang Kai and the young man acted together, striking with their palms and knocking the interloper back.

The newcomer was also young, but his dress and bearing plainly displayed his superior status; he clearly had backing.

After being shoved back, he reddened with anger and sneered, “You dare strike me? You’re bold—no one in Fuyun City dares lay a hand on me. Do you know who I am?”

“I don’t care who you are; if you dare reach out again, I’ll cut that hand off,” the youth who had been contesting the Earthfire Core with Yang Kai snarled; while he could remain calm when competing with Yang Kai by each using their own means, this sudden upstart annoyed him.

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered but he said nothing; his aura likewise began to grow dangerous.

The onlookers erupted in exclamations.

“Young sirs,” the seller glanced at the newcomer and his face changed subtly, whispering, “This is Young Master Nie Cong; you two can’t take him on.”

“Big backing?” Yang Kai asked in surprise; he noticed many among the crowd showed evident fear upon seeing Nie Cong, and those near him kept their distance.

Nie Cong’s own cultivation was not high—only around the sixth or seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm—but their apprehension made it clear they feared the power behind him.

The seller, uneasy, looked Nie Cong over and saw the youth swaggering with no intention of restraint; he realized Nie Cong expected him to announce his identity so the two rash lads would yield.

Settling his nerves, the seller explained in a low voice, “You two likely haven’t been in Fuyun City long, so you don’t know—our city has a lord and two deputy lords, all Saint Realm experts. One deputy lord is Zhou Liang, a human expert; he has a woman named Nie Chufeng, a First Stage of the Transcendent Realm master, and this Young Master Nie Cong is Nie Chufeng’s nephew. The deputy lord Zhou Liang dotes on Nie Chufeng.”

“I see.” Yang Kai and his rival both nodded; Young Master Nie clearly had a Saint Realm powerhouse behind him and was the city's local tyrant, which explained his arrogance and why many feared him.

Nie Cong sneered, “You know who I am now, right? If so, put the Earthfire Core down. If you do it now I can let you leave in peace.”

Yang Kai was taken aback. “Isn’t fighting forbidden in Fuyun City?”

The seller winced and stammered, “You joke, young sir. Where is there no fighting? That rule suits most, but there are always a few who place themselves above it.”

He glanced at Nie Cong, whether deliberately or not.

Nie Cong clearly did not need to abide by the rule.

“You understand how serious this is, right?” the rival suddenly said seriously to Yang Kai. “If you do, let go now; otherwise if Young Master Nie Cong loses his temper you won’t leave here alive.”

“And why should I let go?” Yang Kai smiled at him.

The young man snorted, “You—there’s no reasoning with you. Do you not know how to spell death?”

“Which of us dies first, you or I?” Yang Kai refused to yield an inch.

Fei Yu’s beautiful eyes glittered as she watched events change, silently condensing True Yuan, ready to act at a moment’s notice.

As the two men squabbled, Nie Cong’s face darkened; he found it unacceptable that these two showed no fear even after learning his identity and background.

This displeased him greatly.

He took a step forward and said coldly, “I don’t care where you come from or what your background is—within Fuyun City, I call the shots.”

Saying this, he again reached for the Earthfire Core; True Yuan pulsed on his hand, clearly intending that if he could not seize it he would simply destroy the Earthfire Core.

Yang Kai’s face flushed and he suddenly punched toward Nie Cong’s reaching hand.

At the same time the rival’s long hand moved slightly.

Nie Cong’s body froze in place, his expression turning especially vivid.

In the next instant a streak of blood blossomed; Nie Cong’s reaching hand snapped off at the wrist, and before it could fall to the ground it exploded into a cloud of blood mist in midair.
