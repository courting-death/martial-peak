## Chapter 220 — Who is the Yellow Sparrow

The battle against the two Illusory Electric Wolves was exceedingly arduous, fraught with peril. Relying solely on his cultivation at the Separation and Union Realm Third Stage, Yang Kai dared not reveal all his means. Time and again, he found himself in dire straits, yet miraculously turned danger into safety. It was as if he were walking a tightrope high above the ground; a slight misstep could see him torn to shreds by these two Demonic Beasts.

Bit by bit, he wore down the ferocity of the two beasts, inflicting injuries upon them, and after nearly an hour, he finally dispatched them one after the other.

His body was drenched in blood, some of it belonging to the Illusory Electric Wolves, and some his own. He bore at least seven or eight wounds, all inflicted by the two beasts’ claws and bites. One wound had even torn away some flesh, causing a piercing pain and leaving him in a disheveled state.

These injuries were not feigned; they were genuine wounds. Fourth-Order Demonic Beasts were equivalent to martial artists at the Separation and Union Realm, and for Yang Kai to suppress them to this extent while facing two at once was already a source of pride.

However, the hidden individuals nearby were remarkably patient. While Yang Kai battled the Illusory Electric Wolves, they had yet to reveal themselves, and even now, they remained concealed.

Yang Kai panted heavily, casting a furtive glance in their direction before sitting down on the ground, adopting a posture to circulate his energy, quietly awaiting the formation of the blood pearls from the two Illusory Electric Wolves.

Perhaps Yang Kai’s act was too convincing; the hidden individuals, after confirming there was no danger around, finally took action.

The sound of footsteps approached, unmasked.

Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, a cold glint flashing within.

Looking up, he saw three figures swaggering toward him from not far ahead. All three were men, dressed in dark red long robes, appearing exceedingly ostentatious.

The leader among them laughed heartily, his voice loud and grating, and he looked at Yang Kai with a playful expression.

Yang Kai appropriately displayed a look of panic, his eyes filled with hatred and regret as he slowly rose to his feet, focusing his mind in vigilance.

The three exchanged glances and then encircled him.

“Gentlemen, what is the meaning of this?” Yang Kai licked his dry lips and asked in a deep voice. This unintentional gesture only heightened the sense of fear in his heart.

“What an interesting question!” The man who had laughed earlier looked down on Yang Kai with disdain. “What do we mean? Can’t you tell?”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and replied, “Two blood pearls. If you gentlemen wish for them, feel free to take them, just don’t make things difficult for me.”

The man sneered coldly, “What are two blood pearls? Don’t you know that the quality and grade of blood pearls formed from the death of martial artists are far superior to those of Demonic Beasts? We want the blood pearls, and we want your life as well!”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened, “You gentlemen are being overly unreasonable. I am a disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion; if you kill me, my elders will not let this go lightly!”

“Hahaha!” The man laughed again upon hearing this, “If we were outside, we might have some reservations, but in this place? If you die here, no one will know it was us!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the look of panic on Yang Kai’s face suddenly vanished. It turned cold and ruthless, a killing intent surging forth as his primordial energy erupted. He swiftly turned around, and a blade as thin as a cicada's wing appeared in his right hand, slicing toward the neck of the man who had stealthily approached from behind, who had yet to make his move.

The three men were indeed cautious. After surrounding Yang Kai, they did not strike immediately; after all, their strength was not particularly high, none having reached the True Yuan Realm. One of them spoke to draw Yang Kai’s attention while another crept up to launch a sneak attack.

However, Yang Kai had long since seen through their actions. He merely feigned ignorance and played along.

When the martial artist behind him got close enough, he finally struck.

The sudden outburst caused all three to change color. The man behind Yang Kai had not reacted in time; as the blood-red blade sliced through, he felt a searing heat at his neck, and then a warm liquid gushed uncontrollably out.

Yang Kai moved like the wind. After the blade made contact with the man’s neck, he shifted his feet, employing his self-created footwork technique, and pounced onto the second man like a fierce tiger.

In a hurry, this man retaliated with a strike, his fist ringing with the sound of metal clashing, glowing brilliantly with golden light and carrying immense force.

Yang Kai directly flung the blade made of Yang Liquid, striking the incoming fist.

With a cry of pain, the blade pierced through, blood gushing from the fist. Seizing the moment of his agony, Yang Kai crouched low and delivered a heavy punch to the man’s abdomen.

Like crashing waves, primordial energy surged into him, causing the man’s complexion to pale. Accompanied by three dull thuds, he spat out blood and staggered backward.

Yang Kai moved like a spirit swallow, light and agile, leaping onto the man’s shoulder, his feet clamping down on the man’s head, and his body twisted sharply.

With a crack, the second martial artist’s neck was snapped.

In the blink of an eye, the battle erupted, two of the three men were killed, leaving the last one frozen in shock. It was not until Yang Kai lightly descended from the air that he regained his senses.

“You…” The remaining martial artist’s face was filled with horror. The sudden turn of events left him shaken, and Yang Kai’s ruthless and savage attacks made him tremble in fear.

With a loud laugh, Yang Kai said, “Friend, next time you boast, consider whether you have the weight to back it up, lest the wind blows and you trip over your own tongue.”

Looking at Yang Kai, drenched in blood, and sensing the violent and fierce fluctuations of his primordial energy, the man’s face turned pale in an instant. At this point, he could see that Yang Kai had not used his full strength in his earlier battle with the two Illusory Electric Wolves. With his skills and this surging primordial energy, he could have easily killed those two beasts in less than the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, yet he had deliberately played it out for the benefit of the three of them.

“So you knew we were hiding nearby all along!” The man’s expression turned cold. His two companions had died almost instantaneously, and though terrified, it ignited his killing intent and rage.

“The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind… Tsk tsk… You had a good plan, so why shouldn’t I take advantage of it?” Yang Kai sneered.

“You’re dead!” The man roared repeatedly, fiercely urging his primordial energy. A large golden seal suddenly appeared before him, indicating he had activated some martial technique, and this technique was certainly not of low grade.

Yang Kai’s expression turned grim, and he no longer held back. The Unyielding Will enveloped him, and his already violent primordial energy surged even more, his aura becoming strange and ominous, filled with boundless killing intent.

The peak strength of the Separation and Union Realm!

The Unyielding Will had always been Yang Kai’s trump card, and he usually refrained from using it to avoid revealing his secrets. However, in this place, facing such an enemy, he no longer wished to hold back.

As long as he could eradicate them completely, he would have no worries behind him. Thus, he could unleash his strongest power with confidence.

The enemy’s expression changed once more in shock. Yang Kai’s sudden surge in strength caught him off guard, but there was no turning back. With one hand holding the golden seal, he roared and charged at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai remained unafraid, his hand forming a claw as he grasped the golden seal.

His body trembled slightly; after all, this was a martial technique, and it was not so easy to block. The opponent’s mouth curled into a sinister smile, and he urged his primordial energy even more fiercely.

Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi suddenly erupted, the scorching primordial energy pouring into the golden seal. In less than a moment, cracking sounds began to echo.

The golden seal was actually being burned and cracked.

The purity and density of Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi were not inferior to that of an average True Yuan Realm martial artist. This opponent only had the strength of the Separation and Union Realm Eighth Stage, and with his primordial energy not yet transformed into True Yuan, he was no match for Yang Kai in a direct confrontation.

The cracking sounds continued.

The opponent’s face turned pale as he sensed something was wrong, hurriedly saying, “Friend, please show mercy! I am a disciple of the Golden Light Palace. I was blind before and have offended you; please forgive me!”

Yang Kai let out a cold laugh, his eyes growing wilder and bloodthirsty, “I know you are a disciple of the Golden Light Palace!”

Precisely because he knew, Yang Kai had boldly staged a play to lure the three of them out. Had it not been for their dark red clothing revealing their identities, he would not have taken such risks.

The Golden Light Palace was merely a third-rate force, and the three disciples who had come this time were all only at the level of the Separation and Union Realm! This point had been mentioned by Ling Taixu to Yang Kai by the lakeside earlier.

With a crash… the golden seal of this disciple of the Golden Light Palace completely exploded.

In that instant, he suddenly erupted with a counterattack, a sharp blade shooting out from his sleeve like a spirit snake emerging from its hole, aimed straight for Yang Kai’s throat.

His earlier pleas for mercy were merely a ruse; with two of his junior brothers killed, the enmity between him and Yang Kai was irreconcilable.

However, this blade did not manage to harm Yang Kai. Midway through, his movements froze as he looked down at his chest, only to see Yang Kai’s hand plunged into his heart.

His heart thumped violently once, then fell silent.

Yang Kai withdrew his hand, blood spraying forth, his expression indifferent.

In a single battle, he had killed three opponents, all martial artists at the Separation and Union Realm Seventh or Eighth Stage, and he had done so without any pressure! Defeating the strong with the weak, overcoming many with few, Yang Kai gained a new understanding of his true strength.

Waiting in place, after a moment, the three martial artists from the Golden Light Palace had their primordial energy and the essence of their flesh condensed into blood pearls.

Yang Kai stepped forward to collect them, surprised to find that these three blood pearls were significantly larger than those he had previously obtained.

They were as large as a thumb.

The blood pearls formed from the deaths of Fourth-Order Demonic Beasts were only the size of peas, but why were the blood pearls from the deaths of Separation and Union Realm martial artists so much larger?

With no time to investigate further, Yang Kai also collected the blood pearls from the two Illusory Electric Wolves, then thoroughly looted the valuable items from the three men before hastily departing the area.

After a stick of incense had passed, many Demonic Beasts gathered in this place, the scent of blood in the air guiding them here.

At this moment, Yang Kai was already several dozen li away.

In the past few days, he had gathered quite a number of blood pearls, and Yang Kai wanted to find a safe place to refine and absorb them. Only then could his strength be enhanced, allowing him to deal with even more powerful Demonic Beasts and enemies.
