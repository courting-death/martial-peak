## Chapter 235 — Tianlang Kingdom: Zi Mo

After a month of training, Yang Kai's gains were minimal. He had not killed many Demonic Beasts, and naturally, he had not obtained any Blood Pearls, but that was secondary.

The key issue was that the Demonic Beasts he encountered were too weak. Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts could not withstand a few moves from Yang Kai, while even Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts were lacking in comparison. Without experiencing arduous battles, he could not hope to break through his own limits.

Yang Kai yearned for the baptism of blood and formidable foes!

However, he did not leave empty-handed. Over the past month, he had inadvertently grasped another application of Beast Soul Techniques.

The remnants of the Beast Soul Techniques obtained from those two powerful Demonic Beasts were not solely for attack! Yet, Yang Kai was still exploring this method, and it required further refinement.

On this day, after Yang Kai had slain three Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts, a woman in a forest thirty miles away suddenly opened her eyes, a glint of coldness and surprise flashing within them.

This woman’s attire and facial features were slightly different from those of the Great Han people; she was indeed a martial artist from the Tianlang Kingdom.

She was not unattractive; in fact, one could say she was quite beautiful. Yet for some reason, she exuded a rather enchanting aura, akin to a hidden beauty snake, ready to strike with her venomous fangs at any moment, leaving her victims in dire straits.

Anyone who saw her would not dare to underestimate her.

Her clothing was rather revealing, with a pair of jade arms exposed. The tight-fitting short top could not conceal her impressive figure. As she raised her hand, her flat abdomen and delicate navel were unmistakable. Below, she wore a simple pair of short shorts, her long, slender legs boldly displayed.

She gazed in Yang Kai's direction, a faint cold smile gracing her lips as she slowly stood up. Her petite figure was filled with unparalleled explosive power.

As she rose, the two individuals standing behind her instinctively took a few steps back, their eyes filled with wariness and resentment as they stared at the Tianlang Kingdom woman’s back.

These two were a man and a woman!

If Yang Kai were present, he would surely be astonished, for these two were disciples of Ghost King Valley—Jin Hao and Leng Shan.

The two elite disciples of Ghost King Valley were now fixated on the woman from Tianlang Kingdom, their True Essence involuntarily surging, a hint of murderous intent flickering in their eyes.

“Roar…” At that moment, dozens of Demonic Beasts suddenly bared their teeth and growled at Jin Hao and Leng Shan, mixed with a warning and a show of force.

The woman from Tianlang Kingdom slowly turned around, casting a meaningful glance at Jin Hao and Leng Shan, causing both to shudder and hurriedly suppress their murderous intent and True Essence.

“You cannot kill me!” The woman from Tianlang Kingdom was named Zi Mo. Jin Hao and Leng Shan had been following her for a month or two and only knew this much about her.

Zi Mo snorted coldly, “This is your only warning. If you dare to harbor any thoughts again, do not blame me for being ruthless!”

Though Jin Hao and Leng Shan’s eyes were filled with humiliation, they did not dare to act recklessly. Jin Hao quickly lowered his head and said, “We would never dare, Miss Zi. Please rest assured!”

Zi Mo looked at him deeply, and after a moment, she smiled sweetly, “You should be grateful to have fallen into my hands. If you had accidentally fallen into the hands of my two Senior Brothers, you would probably have wished for death by now.”

As she spoke, Zi Mo gracefully stepped forward, her slender waist swaying, her lotus steps light and delicate, a faint smile lingering at the corners of her mouth.

Jin Hao secretly glanced up, swallowing hard.

Zi Mo’s figure was exceptional. Her bold attire was vastly different from the women of the Great Han, and although they had spent quite some time together, every glance at her brought him a unique thrill, especially her flat abdomen and exquisite navel, which were immensely alluring to the youthful Jin Hao.

He often fantasized about stripping this enchanting woman bare, ravaging her thoroughly, tasting her beauty, and listening to her pleas and cries. How blissful that would be!

But Jin Hao dared only to think about it. Before Zi Mo, he did not dare entertain any lewd thoughts or ill intentions.

This woman from Tianlang Kingdom was a ruthless killer! More brutal and bloody than the disciples from Ghost King Valley.

Zi Mo approached Leng Shan, still smiling faintly. Leng Shan’s face showed signs of discomfort and disgust, her body even trembling slightly, yet she did not dare to speak.

Zi Mo chuckled lightly, extending a delicate hand to lift Leng Shan’s petite chin, gazing into her crimson lips.

In the next moment, she suddenly leaned in, pressing her lips against Leng Shan’s mouth.

Jin Hao inhaled sharply, discreetly bending over, feeling his blood boil.

The sounds of sucking filled the air as Leng Shan weakly resisted, which only further ignited Zi Mo’s interest. Accompanied by her giggles, Zi Mo’s hand slipped inside Leng Shan’s clothing, exploring and roaming freely.

Jin Hao’s eyes turned red with envy.

Leng Shan held a high position within the sect, and even he did not dare to act recklessly toward her. Yet, these days, she had been wantonly tasted by another woman.

That serpent-like tongue had invaded her mouth, and her ample bosom was being kneaded beyond recognition, while her pert and rounded backside was covered by a delicate hand, constantly shifting shapes before his eyes.

This was not the first or second time; Jin Hao had witnessed this at least seven or eight times during this period, each time igniting his burning desire, making it hard to endure.

Leng Shan’s weak resistance turned into submission as the two women engaged in a passionate embrace, their breaths growing heavy, the sound of their racing hearts echoing, stirring up wild imaginations.

Jin Hao forced himself to turn away, fearing that if he watched any longer, he would lose control.

After a long while, Zi Mo finally released Leng Shan. Their lips parted, a glistening thread connecting them.

Leng Shan’s chest heaved violently, tears glistening at the corners of her eyes. Zi Mo chuckled lightly, reaching out to wipe them away with a tenderness akin to that of a lover.

“Do you wish to possess her as I do?” Zi Mo suddenly turned her head, smiling sweetly at Jin Hao.

“Ah?” Jin Hao was taken aback, a look of confusion on his face.

Zi Mo pursed her lips, “You like your Junior Sister, don’t you?”

Jin Hao glanced at Leng Shan and nodded with difficulty.

“I can give you a chance!” Zi Mo gazed at Jin Hao meaningfully, “It all depends on whether you can seize it!”

Jin Hao’s expression wavered, a look of torment on his face. Zi Mo was not in a hurry, merely watching him quietly, waiting for his response. She knew Jin Hao would not refuse her proposal, for he was not a righteous gentleman.

Sure enough, moments later, Jin Hao suddenly knelt on the ground, speaking earnestly, “I am willing to sincerely submit to you, Miss. From now on, wherever you command, I will go through fire and water without hesitation!”

Zi Mo laughed, her demeanor lively, nodding slightly, “Very well! Those who know how to adapt are the true heroes. I like smart people!”

“Senior Brother…” Leng Shan’s expression turned cold, glaring at Jin Hao with a sinister look.

Jin Hao’s face turned awkward, “Junior Sister, our lives are now in the hands of the Miss. Why resist? The Miss is magnanimous and willing to give us a chance. If we comply with her wishes, we may yet live!”

Leng Shan looked at Jin Hao with disgust, saying nothing more, and slowly closed her eyes.

Zi Mo chuckled lightly, retreating to lean against a large tree, her demeanor lazy and charming. She softly said, “Go and bring someone back for me! After completing this task, your Junior Sister will be at your disposal. Do as you wish!”

Upon hearing this, Leng Shan’s expression changed, while Jin Hao’s face lit up with excitement.

“If you are quick enough and efficient enough, and don’t keep me waiting too long…” Zi Mo licked her crimson lips, “I wouldn’t mind accompanying you once… I am quite open-minded, you know.”

Jin Hao could not help but swallow hard.

To be able to wantonly toy with his Junior Sister… and also have this enchanting woman from Tianlang Kingdom by his side…

A dragon and two phoenixes, a dream come true!

Jin Hao was immediately invigorated, excitedly saying, “Please give your orders, Miss!”

Zi Mo collected her expression, pointing in a direction, “Thirty miles ahead is your target this time. You need to be quick; if you are slow, you might miss them.”

Jin Hao frowned, “May I ask, Miss, how many people are there?”

“There should only be one!” Zi Mo answered confidently.

“One?” Jin Hao’s expression shifted slightly, “To survive alone until now, their strength must be considerable. Miss, I would like to go with my Junior Sister. Please grant me this request!”

Zi Mo giggled charmingly, “I want to keep your Junior Sister here; she cannot accompany you. However… I can send a few Demonic Beasts with you. Would three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts be enough?”

Jin Hao’s expression soured, knowing that she still did not trust him. Three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts could easily kill him. Rather than being reinforcements, they would be monitoring him.

“That will be enough!” Jin Hao did not dare show any dissatisfaction and quickly nodded.

“Go then, and remember, your Junior Sister is waiting for your return with affection… and so am I.” Zi Mo threw a flirtatious glance at Jin Hao.

“Yes!” Jin Hao was invigorated, rising to fly in the direction Zi Mo indicated.

The three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts quickly followed.

Among Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts, there were varying levels of strength. As Jin Hao flew, he glanced back. Upon seeing what the three Demonic Beasts looked like, he could not help but curse.

If they were just three ordinary Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts, Jin Hao could handle them, but these three were among the stronger ones, each possessing the strength of the True Essence Realm, around the fifth or sixth layer. He dared not entertain any reckless thoughts.

Thus, he could only resign himself to completing the task given by Zi Mo.

Jin Hao’s speed was swift. With thoughts of Leng Shan and Zi Mo’s figures in his mind, he arrived at his destination in less than the time it takes to burn an incense stick.

He concealed his aura, glanced around, and found no traces, but there were some remnants of powder left behind. This powder was the residue left by a Demonic Beast after death.

The three Demonic Beasts that had followed him sniffed around before suddenly chasing in a certain direction.

Jin Hao hurriedly followed.

After tracking for about half an hour, the three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts suddenly stopped, their expressions fierce as they bared their teeth at a dense forest.

Jin Hao landed, his gaze cold as he looked at the forest, shouting, “Which friend is here? Please reveal yourself.”
