## Chapter 311 — Piaoxiang City

Half a month later, Piaoxiang City.

This is a place as prosperous as any major city in the outside world, and it is also the palace of the Enchantress Queen.

Cangyun Evil Land, vast in area, is divided into six major regions, each guarded by a different Evil King.

Centered around Piaoxiang City, within a radius of a thousand miles, lies the territory of Shan Qingluo.

Over the past half month, Shan Qingluo has carefully led Yang Kai and the two women, Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, through the territories controlled by the other two Evil Kings, returning here cautiously.

Upon entering Piaoxiang City, everyone couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

After spending half a month together, not only has Yang Kai's perception of Cangyun Evil Land changed, but even Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman have overturned their impressions of Cangyun Evil Land.

In rumors, Cangyun Evil Land is filled with evil martial artists, and it is said that anyone encountered there is a heinous criminal beyond redemption.

However, according to Shan Qingluo's introduction, Cangyun Evil Land is not as unbearable as the outside world claims! At least, it is like this in the territory she controls.

Undeniably, there are indeed many wicked individuals in Cangyun Evil Land, but there are also many people with genuine feelings.

Many martial artists who committed offenses within their own sects, forced to step into Cangyun Evil Land, are common, as are those who have offended powerful forces and entered Cangyun Evil Land to escape disaster. There are also some who are simply labeled as evil due to their dark cultivation methods, like rats crossing the street, universally condemned.

It can be said that many martial artists in Cangyun Evil Land have their own pasts filled with hardship; they are not necessarily all evil.

"The world only recognizes light. They refuse to acknowledge the darkness within their hearts, so we are labeled as evil... Haha, how ridiculous!" Shan Qingluo said with a helpless expression when discussing this.

Although she is one of the six Evil Kings, governing a vast area, she still cannot change the deeply rooted thoughts and views of the world.

Yang Kai recalled what the Earth Demon once said.

What is a person, and what is a demon? Humans and demons are essentially one family!

Everyone has evil within their hearts.

Entering the city, the bustling atmosphere of Piaoxiang City dazzled Yang Kai. He couldn't help but marvel.

If he didn't know he was in Cangyun Evil Land, he might have thought this was just another ordinary city.

Everything here is no different from the cities outside. Many ordinary merchants and travelers live here, and martial artists come and go like fish crossing a river. Most people do not take advantage of their strength when interacting with these ordinary people. Occasionally, a few martial artists with strange appearances and filled with evil energy also strictly adhere to the rules of Piaoxiang City, not daring to cause any trouble.

Within the city, there are often martial artists dressed in black tight clothing passing by; these individuals are the law enforcement team maintaining order in Piaoxiang City.

Anyone who commits wrongdoing within Piaoxiang City will be ruthlessly attacked by these law enforcement officers.

Thus, among all of Cangyun Evil Land, Piaoxiang City is the safest place, and Shan Qingluo's effective management has made this city increasingly prosperous, with few criminals.

At this moment, the Queen is veiled in black silk, concealing her true appearance, leading the way ahead, walking leisurely.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman follow behind her, secretly observing the sights of the city while admiring her in their hearts.

To maintain such peace in the entire city, Shan Qingluo's methods are not simple.

As they walked, Yang Kai suddenly halted his steps.

Noticing this, Shan Qingluo turned around to look at him, "What's wrong?"

Yang Kai grinned, "Beautiful lady, as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. Let’s part ways here."

Although being favored by a beauty is a delightful matter, Yang Kai truly fears that one day Shan Qingluo might not be able to restrain herself and take him.

Moreover, it has been a while since he separated from Su Yan, and he is eager to inquire about her situation.

Hearing his words, Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes sparkled, understanding his thoughts, and she smiled as she walked back, grabbing Yang Kai's arm, her breath fragrant, "Do you think you can just walk away?"

"No need to be so enthusiastic!" Yang Kai's expression turned bitter; the worst thing he feared had indeed happened.

He was worried that Shan Qingluo wouldn’t let him go. On the way back, he had tried to escape multiple times, but each time he was seen through before he could even act.

With Shan Qingluo being so powerful, if she truly wanted to keep him, he would have no way out.

"The outside world is in chaos; it’s not necessarily safe for you out there. It’s better to stay here with me for a while."

"For how long?"

"Depends on my mood, hehe..."

Yang Kai's face darkened considerably. Damn it, if he stayed here, wouldn’t he become this enchantress's plaything?

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman looked at him with glee, feeling an inexplicable sense of joy.

Bound by Shan Qingluo, he couldn’t even move his True Essence, yet this enchantress maintained an extremely obedient demeanor, one arm linked with Yang Kai's, gently leaning against him, filled with affection.

Fortunately, she was veiled; otherwise, if someone saw them, who knows how chaotic Piaoxiang City would become.

Before long, they arrived at Shan Qingluo's palace.

This palace is built in an extraordinarily magnificent manner, occupying an unmatched vast area, with exquisite towers and flying dragons carved into phoenixes, exuding a grand momentum.

Upon entering, Yang Kai unexpectedly found this enormous palace to be exceptionally quiet, seemingly devoid of many inhabitants.

Winding through the corridors, he could still hear the sounds of flowing water nearby, creating a poetic ambiance.

"My palace is usually quite empty, with only a few maidservants around, so you don’t need to be too reserved!" Shan Qingluo explained softly. Once back in the palace, she completely relaxed, reaching up to remove her veil, slowly stretching her body, revealing her exquisite curves.

"Who is it!" A delicate voice called out, and in an instant, a purple figure swiftly approached.

"It’s me!" Shan Qingluo replied lightly.

The newcomer paused for a moment, then flew over at an even faster speed. In the blink of an eye, a sweet-looking, petite girl appeared before everyone.

"My lady, you have finally returned!" The girl, appearing to be in her teens, was in the prime of her youth. Upon seeing Shan Qingluo, her beautiful eyes sparkled with joy and relief.

Overwhelmed with happiness, her eyes brimmed with tears, and after stopping from her hurried run, her chest heaved dramatically.

Yang Kai glanced at her and found the girl to be quite charming.

With long hair flowing like clouds, willow-like eyebrows, bright and beautiful eyes, a delicate nose, rosy cheeks, and lips like flowers, her skin was as translucent as snow, and her figure was exceptionally alluring.

Yang Kai was taken aback, secretly praising that she was indeed a maid of the Enchantress Queen, possessing such beauty.

Scanning her with his Divine Sense, he was surprised to find that this girl had the strength of the True Essence Realm Seventh Stage. Although she was not as strong as Qiu Yimeng, she was not far behind, and she was likely a year or two younger than Qiu Yimeng.

Feeling the sweep of Divine Sense, the girl inexplicably felt a chill run through her body, and her eyes suddenly turned cold as she stared at Yang Kai, scrutinizing him deeply.

Her perception is quite sharp! Yang Kai chuckled lightly, casually averting his gaze.

Furrowing her brows slightly, the girl clearly didn’t understand why Shan Qingluo had brought three people back, but she didn’t dwell on Yang Kai. Instead, she eagerly asked, "My lady, I heard that the Beast King ambushed you! Were you hurt?"

"No serious injuries," Shan Qingluo shook her head slightly, "No need to worry."

"That’s good! The Beast King is truly despicable; the elders almost went to fight him over this. By the way, my lady, the Eight Great Families are currently uniting with various sects to attack the Holy Land, and many people from Piaoxiang City have also been sent out to confront them. The elders said..."

"Let’s talk about it tomorrow; I’m a bit tired today." Shan Qingluo interrupted her, "As long as the elders are in charge, it’s fine."

"Oh." The girl nodded slightly, looking at Yang Kai and the other two with suspicion, "These three..."

Shan Qingluo frowned as she glanced at Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, suddenly chuckling, and shot out two beams of light.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman's bodies trembled, and by the time they realized what was happening, their True Essence could no longer be used.

"What does Sister Shan mean by this?" Qiu Yimeng forced a smile.

"Nothing." Shan Qingluo smiled lightly, "Bilo, take these two young ladies to the Yingxiang Tower."

"Oh." Bilo curiously sized up Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, wondering how these two had provoked the lady to be placed under house arrest in the Yingxiang Tower.

Though puzzled, she didn’t ask further and simply clapped her hands.

Soon, several young maidens approached, each one beautiful, and their strength was not low, but they were all dressed in maid attire.

"Take them to the Yingxiang Tower," Bilo instructed.

"Yes!"

"Take good care of them; don’t let the two young ladies suffer any grievances!" Shan Qingluo cheerfully reminded.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman looked dejected, offering no resistance, and with a resigned smile, they followed the maidens away.

"And him?" Bilo pointed at Yang Kai, filled with confusion. She had never seen the lady bring a young man into the palace; even when other Evil Kings visited, they were only arranged in the reception area. This quiet place had never seen a man step foot in it.

"As for him..." Shan Qingluo smiled meaningfully, casting another beam of light into Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly, and he quietly circulated his True Essence, finding no obstruction, but a seal had been placed within him, one that he could not resolve by any means.

"Take him to the Fenghuan Tower to rest!" Shan Qingluo smiled sweetly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face darkened, filled with displeasure.

"The Fenghuan Tower..." Bilo exclaimed, her beautiful eyes filled with surprise.

That place is the deepest part of the palace, the best building in the palace, where the lady lived when she was still a young girl.

Inside, there are even the bedding and curtains used by the lady, fragrant pillows and jade cushions, and even the lingering scent of the lady remains.

Most importantly, that is where the lady's memories from her youth are kept.

Such a private place, how could it be arranged for a man to reside in?
