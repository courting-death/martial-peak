## Chapter 2265 — Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm

Liu Yan had no physical form, no fleshly body. Other than devouring and fusing with certain special energies to strengthen herself, she could not absorb the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth to increase her cultivation like a martial artist could.

This was precisely why Yang Kai had her stand guard.

Once Liu Yan concealed her form, Yang Kai reached out and released the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal, two Blood Beasts he had not used in a long time.

As his cultivation improved, the usefulness of these two Blood Beasts had diminished. Especially the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal, which was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—useless against weak foes, and of no help against strong ones. But at this moment, it was the perfect time for them to shine.

With a flicker of Divine Sense, Yang Kai had the two Blood Beasts conceal themselves nearby, while he found a spot far from Qin Chaoyang and the others, sat down cross-legged, and prepared himself.

The fluctuations of energy within his body grew stronger and more pronounced—this was clearly the prelude to a breakthrough. Yang Kai focused his mind, calm as a still well, and began circulating his profound arts.

Down here underground, it was as if he were sitting atop a spiritual spring. Without any effort, the omnipresent Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth surged toward him, flooding his limbs and bones, settling into his Dantian.

Time passed slowly as Yang Kai continued to accumulate his own strength.

At a certain moment, the power within him quietly reached a critical point. This threshold was like an invisible wall, blocking Yang Kai’s path forward, preventing him from seeing the broader vistas and more beautiful scenery ahead.

Unperturbed, he calmly gathered all his strength and launched a thunderous assault on that shackle.

Boom—

A sound echoed from deep within his soul. Yang Kai’s body trembled slightly, his face turned pale, and a trace of pain appeared on his features.

Unexpectedly, this attempt failed at the crucial moment.

This was something he had rarely experienced since he began cultivating—only when he was much weaker had he felt this kind of failure after a breakthrough attempt. It filled him with a deep sense of nostalgia. He was neither alarmed nor flustered; instead, he grinned fiercely.

This breakthrough was not the natural result of cultivation, but was forced by external circumstances. Some obstacles were only to be expected. Yet these obstacles could not shake Yang Kai’s Martial Dao heart; on the contrary, they only further ignited his fighting spirit.

He calmed his mind and continued to gather his strength.

After a moment, he launched another assault.

Boom, boom, boom—

Again and again, the Origin Qi within him trembled without end. Each impact brought excruciating pain, a torment to both body and soul that ordinary people could not endure. If one lost heart at this point, their Martial Dao heart would stagnate, and they would never make any further progress.

Countless martial artists, unable to withstand such pain, began to doubt themselves and ultimately fell into obscurity.

Only by pressing forward with courage can a martial artist reach the peak.

The repeated pain did not shake Yang Kai’s confidence or make him panic. Instead, it made his heart even calmer.

“The Dao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things... Fate is forged by oneself, realms are born of the heart. All things are but manifestations, all living beings mere forms. Illusion arises from the heart, and is extinguished by the heart…”

A thread of enlightenment quietly rose in his mind. Yang Kai suddenly felt a sense of clarity.

An invisible force coiled around him, transforming into formless power. It pierced that shackle, shattered the wall ahead, and opened a broad road forward.

Rumble—

A visible shockwave spread out from Yang Kai’s body, sweeping in all directions. The aura of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm instantly filled the air.

Yet Yang Kai remained motionless, a strange sensation welling up within him. In that feeling, his Spirit Body seemed to leave its shell, slowly rising, taking in everything below at a glance.

He clearly saw Liu Yan holding the Xuan Realm Pearl, hidden in the void, her presence concealed. The endless flow of heaven-and-earth spiritual liquid poured into the Xuan Realm Pearl, becoming Spiritual Qi inside it.

Perhaps because of some mysterious connection with Yang Kai himself, as he looked at her, Liu Yan suddenly frowned, glanced in his direction, her beautiful eyes full of confusion.

Yang Kai saw Hua Qingsi frantically devouring Spiritual Qi, laying a solid foundation for her future advancement to Emperor Realm.

He saw Zhang Ruoxi’s cultivation rising rapidly. In just a short while, she had reached the level of the Void King Realm, and the Baptism of heaven and earth followed.

Just like last time in the Four Seasons Land, when Zhang Ruoxi broke through to the Origin Returning Realm, this time as she broke through the Void King Realm, a gigantic phantom suddenly appeared behind her.

The phantom was pure white and hazy, enormous and unmatched. Judging by its form, it was a woman—a stunning beauty, with a graceful figure, both hands gripping a giant sword planted before her. Her beautiful eyes shone like stars. Just one glance left Yang Kai’s Divine Sense dazed.

The giant phantom opened its red lips and took a sudden breath, instantly absorbing all the heaven-and-earth power gathered in the sky. Then the phantom shrank back into Zhang Ruoxi’s body.

The little girl also broke through to the Void King Realm without the slightest hindrance or danger.

Yang Kai also saw many Dao Origin Realm martial artists breaking through their own bottlenecks. Some laughed madly, others struggled, all striving to shatter their shackles.

His spirit continued to rise, soon reaching several thousand zhang into the sky. Looking out, he saw that in Fenglin City, two thousand li away, the place was bustling and spectacular.

In the sky, masses of Heaven-and-Earth Energy became visible trials and tribulations, baptizing the martial artists below as they broke through to new realms.

From time to time, someone would break through successfully, their long howls echoing.

His gaze turned farther afield, his spirit continued to rise.

Soon, the entire Fenglin City became a tiny black dot. Yang Kai looked up and saw the sky full of twinkling stars, the constellations shifting.

In the unseen depths, the power of the world’s Laws seemed almost within reach.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. He reached out to grasp the void around him, clenching his fist tightly.

It was as if he had caught nothing, yet also something.

Yang Kai looked confused, but at that moment, an invisible might of heaven and earth suddenly descended, falling upon his head. That power contained unimaginable force and a terrifying intent of destruction.

“Not good!” Yang Kai cried out in his heart. With a flicker of Divine Sense, he plummeted downward at incredible speed, returning to his body in the blink of an eye.

“Boom—”

That mighty force of heaven and earth followed close behind, crashing down upon him.

Yang Kai felt as if struck by lightning, his face changed dramatically, and his entire Origin Qi was thrown into chaos.

“Puh—” He spat out a mouthful of golden blood, his aura instantly withering, but his eyes remained as bright as stars.

“What the hell is this...” Yang Kai looked up at the void, grinning fiercely. “A warning, huh... Even peeking at the world’s Laws ahead of time isn’t allowed? Damn you, old heavens!”

He was certain that if not for the suppression of that mighty force just now, if he’d had a little more time, he might have glimpsed the true nature of the Laws.

If that had happened, then with a single thought, he would have grasped the Laws, gaining the capital that only those in the Emperor Realm possessed.

Unfortunately, at the final moment, he was blocked by the might of heaven and earth, failing at the last step. It seemed the world’s power would not allow such a thing.

Still, he had not come away empty-handed.

After cursing, Yang Kai lowered his head, spread his fingers, and as he flicked them, the power of Spatial Law coiled around him. Tiny spatial cracks danced and flowed between his fingertips like living things!

His control over the power of Spatial Law was much more skillful than before.

He flicked his fingers repeatedly, sending those tiny spatial cracks shooting out like flying needles, piercing the surrounding stone walls and carving out one crack after another.

Yang Kai grinned, a look of satisfaction appearing on his face.

In the past, he could not control the power of Spatial Law with such finesse, but now he could.

Although this attack was somewhat weaker than the Moon Blade, it was far more difficult to defend against. In some situations, it was definitely more useful than the Moon Blade.

Next, Yang Kai checked his cultivation and found that he had indeed broken through to the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Only then did he put away his frustration, take out some Pills, and swallow them.

The shock from the world’s power just now hadn’t injured him too badly, but it couldn’t be ignored. Who knew if such wounds might leave aftereffects, so it was best to heal as soon as possible.

While Yang Kai was healing, Qin Chaoyang had already gathered his strength to its peak. Suddenly, his body trembled, a shockwave spread, his aura soared, and his robes roared.

In the next moment, the wrinkles on Qin Chaoyang’s face gradually faded, making him look decades younger. His complexion became rosy, and even his white hair gained some black strands.

Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!

Qin Chaoyang had also broken through.

He did not rush to open his eyes, but continued to sit and absorb Spiritual Qi, consolidating his cultivation.

Time passed slowly.

At a certain moment, a martial artist in the midst of a breakthrough suddenly frowned, a look of suspicion on his face.

Moments later, his aura deflated like a punctured balloon.

At this sudden change, he opened his eyes wide and shouted in grief and anger, “What the hell! I was in the middle of a breakthrough—why has the Spiritual Qi become so thin?!”

It was precisely because of the rich Spiritual Qi here that he had been able to trigger his breakthrough. Now, with the Spiritual Qi suddenly thinning, he could not reach the critical point, and his breakthrough attempt ended in failure.

“Ah, Brother Liu, you too?” A familiar voice called out nearby. “I thought it was just me.”

“No, no, the Spiritual Qi was surging so fiercely—how could it suddenly thin out? Even if a few Emperor Realm experts came, they couldn’t possibly devour so much Spiritual Qi in such a short time.”

“Did some bastard block the spiritual spring below?” another voice rang out.

“Come to think of it, I did see someone jump down. Maybe that’s really what happened.”

“Which son of a bitch is so lacking in virtue? This is outrageous!”

“Let’s go take a look! If someone really dared do this, I’ll spill his blood within five steps! To dare block my path to advancement—unforgivable!”
