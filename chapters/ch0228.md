## Chapter 228 — The Situation

Yang Kai saw many familiar faces, all of whom he had previously encountered by the lakeside.

Among them were the four young women from Wan Hua Palace, along with disciples from Wen Xin Palace, Shui Yue Hall, Jiu Xing Sword Sect, Lie Huo Sect, and Fei Yu Pavilion...

The disciples from various sects had gathered here, totaling around thirty individuals, all of whom were the elite of their respective forces.

However, at this moment, the condition of these individuals did not seem very good. Their True Essence was greatly depleted, and many bore injuries of varying severity.

Having just finished a fierce battle, most of the thirty or so people hurriedly sat down to recuperate. Only one person was moving about the battlefield, collecting the blood beads left behind by the Demonic Beasts after their demise.

A gaze shot towards Yang Kai. Following that gaze, Yang Kai saw a young man, around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, staring at him with a cold expression.

This young man was robust and stood out from the crowd. Although his clothes were tattered, they remained tidy and unwrinkled. Bloodstains adorned his body, adding a rugged and fierce aura to his presence. He stood there quietly, like a sword drawn from its sheath, exuding sharpness and a piercing spirit.

After a moment of eye contact, the young man withdrew his gaze and began conversing with the person who was collecting the blood beads, holding the gathered blood beads in his hand.

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu approached, both displaying expressions of having survived a calamity.

“What happened?” Yang Kai asked, furrowing his brows. He truly could not comprehend how the current situation had developed. The young disciples from various major forces had come here for training, and their relationship was originally one of rivalry and competition. Unless there was some special reason or unforeseen event, they would not unite like this.

“It’s a long story!” Chen Xueshu gritted his teeth and beckoned Yang Kai to sit down.

Seeing that he was heavily injured, blood flowing freely, Yang Kai reached into his robe and took out a bottle, pouring out a few healing pills and handing them over.

“Healing pills…” Shu Xiaoyu’s eyes brightened.

Chen Xueshu quickly shot her a glance and whispered, “Yang brother, quickly put them away!”

Yang Kai’s brows furrowed even deeper. Although he did not understand the reason, he quietly stuffed the bottle back into his robe and placed the spilled healing pills into Chen Xueshu’s hand.

He was filled with confusion. What was so surprising about a few healing pills? Why was Shu Xiaoyu acting so dramatically? Surely, all the young disciples who came here for training would have brought a few bottles with them for emergencies.

His Spatial Pouch contained over a dozen bottles of pills, all prepared by his master Ling Taixu, but he had yet to use any.

Shu Xiaoyu looked around and stuck out her tongue, appearing somewhat embarrassed.

“Senior Brother, how did you all end up gathering together?” Yang Kai quietly inquired. This was his greatest perplexity.

“Out of necessity!” Chen Xueshu forced a bitter smile.

“Were you threatened by someone?” Yang Kai’s expression turned cold.

“Not exactly,” Chen Xueshu shook his head repeatedly. “We gathered together voluntarily, out of self-preservation. If we didn’t come together, we wouldn’t be able to survive here at all.”

“Is there some danger that has forced you to unite?” Yang Kai asked, astonished.

“Indeed,” Chen Xueshu nodded.

“Is it humans or Demonic Beasts?” 

“Both humans and Demonic Beasts,” Chen Xueshu sighed heavily and then looked up to ask, “Do you still remember the person from a sect we saw by the lakeside? Their attire and appearance were somewhat different from our Great Han martial artists?”

How could Yang Kai forget? He had a deep impression of that group. He nodded and replied, “Those were martial artists from the Tianlang Kingdom.”

Chen Xueshu stared at him in astonishment. “Brother Yang actually knows their origins! We paid a great price to find out that those people were not martial artists from our Great Han.”

“My master told me before.”

Chen Xueshu was greatly shocked, admiration evident on his face. “Senior Ling truly has a wealth of knowledge.”

“What does that have to do with those few Tianlang Kingdom martial artists? They are indeed strong, but there are only four of them. Are you all afraid of them?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled, furrowing his brows.

“If it were just those four, we wouldn’t be afraid at all! The martial artists from the Tianlang Kingdom daring to act recklessly in our Great Han is simply seeking death. We could easily send a few people to eliminate them,” Chen Xueshu said indignantly. After a moment, he forced a bitter smile and continued, “But they don’t only have four people. We don’t know what kind of strange cultivation technique they practice, but they can actually enslave Demonic Beasts to fight for them! Each of those four has hundreds of Demonic Beasts under their command. How can we fight against that?”

Yang Kai’s face twitched in shock. “So the Demonic Beasts that surrounded you earlier, and the ones just now, were all driven by the Tianlang Kingdom martial artists?”

“Exactly,” Chen Xueshu nodded heavily. “Over a hundred sect disciples from our Great Han entered this foreign land for training, but we didn’t expect that the people from the Tianlang Kingdom were already prepared. In the first month or two, those thieves didn’t make any moves, allowing our Great Han martial artists to hunt Demonic Beasts and fight among ourselves. But after two months, once they had enslaved a considerable number of Demonic Beasts, they immediately targeted the disciples of our Great Han sects. Many were caught unprepared and were hunted down by those Demonic Beasts. The people from the Tianlang Kingdom didn’t even need to lift a finger; they let the Demonic Beasts do the work for them.”

Yang Kai was utterly astonished, his heart unable to calm down for a long time.

However, one of his doubts was finally cleared up. No wonder the two groups of Demonic Beasts he had seen earlier were of different types; it turned out someone was enslaving them!

“After these months of fighting, the number of Demonic Beasts under the Tianlang Kingdom martial artists has only increased, while the number of our Great Han martial artists has dwindled. We initially gathered fifty people, but now over a dozen have died. I estimate that the rest are probably no longer among the living.”

In other words, now only the four martial artists from the Tianlang Kingdom and the thirty or so remaining here were surviving in this foreign land.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, feeling somewhat dazed. There had been at least two to three hundred people who entered that day, yet after more than half a year, only one-tenth remained. The ones who had died were all elites from various sects, and the losses were indeed heavy.

As they spoke, Chen Xueshu was filled with regret, his face flushed. “This is truly embarrassing. If word gets out, all the sects here will lose face…”

The young elites of the Great Han had gathered together, yet they were suppressed by the distant Tianlang Kingdom, standing out as the strongest. If this were to spread, they would only become the laughingstock of the world, no wonder he felt embarrassed.

“Senior Brother, it’s not your fault!” Shu Xiaoyu comforted softly. “It’s not that we’re not strong enough; it’s that those people are too cunning and well-prepared.”

“Alas.” Chen Xueshu sighed, feeling dejected. “I just hope this damned place closes quickly, and we can get out of here.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brows in contemplation and suddenly asked, “With so many of you gathered together now, who is giving the orders?”

They were all elites, accustomed to being in charge within their own sects. Such individuals were proud and self-important, and without a leader capable of commanding them, they would surely be a disorganized group.

Chen Xueshu pointed to the side and said, “That one, Wu Chengyi from Jiu Xing Sword Sect, a True Essence Realm Seventh Stage expert. Among all those training here, he is the strongest, so for now, everyone listens to him.”

Following his gaze, Yang Kai glanced over and was surprised to find it was the young man he had made eye contact with earlier.

No wonder he gave off the feeling of a sword drawn from its sheath; it turned out he was an elite from Jiu Xing Sword Sect. Yang Kai nodded to himself.

Jiu Xing Sword Sect primarily focused on sword techniques and was a renowned sect, enjoying a great reputation within the Great Han.

People referred to Jiu Xing Sword Sect as the foremost power besides the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu! This meant it was second only to the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, highlighting the strength of Jiu Xing Sword Sect.

Wu Chengyi was not only powerful but also came from an extraordinary background. Having such a person temporarily act as a spokesperson was indeed commendable. Aside from him, it was likely that no one among these martial artists could command respect.

Yang Kai nodded to himself, noting, “This person’s demeanor and expression certainly have the air of a leader. It seems Jiu Xing Sword Sect has invested considerable effort in him.”

Shu Xiaoyu, listening from the side, rolled her eyes and whispered, “That guy is so arrogant, always treating us like his subordinates. Moreover, the blood beads obtained from killing Demonic Beasts all have to be distributed through him. I wonder how much he has greedily taken for himself.”

Chen Xueshu shot Shu Xiaoyu a glare. “Don’t speak carelessly. If it weren’t for him taking the lead, we probably wouldn’t have been able to gather together at all and would have been picked off one by one by the Tianlang Kingdom people. He is the strongest and has contributed the most; it’s only right for him to take a little more. Besides, most of the Demonic Beasts here have been enslaved by the Tianlang Kingdom people, so we wouldn’t get many blood beads anyway. If he’s willing to take them, let him. I just hope we can safely get out; I don’t want to think about anything else.”

Shu Xiaoyu retorted, “It’s fine if it’s just that. But he doesn’t care about the lives of others at all. We were sent out this time to hold back a dozen or so Demonic Beasts. If it weren’t for you, Yang brother, coming to save us, Senior Brother, you would…”

Recalling the danger they had just faced, Shu Xiaoyu’s eyes turned red, on the verge of tears.

“Why are you crying? Don’t let Yang brother see you and laugh at us. We made it through without any danger, didn’t we?” Chen Xueshu comforted while giving Yang Kai an apologetic smile.

Yang Kai furrowed his brows and asked, “You were surrounded by Demonic Beasts because he sent you out?”

Chen Xueshu forced a smile. “It’s just a rotation. This time, my Senior Brother and fellow disciples had bad luck and encountered a few more, almost not making it back.”

With a sigh, Yang Kai could understand Chen Xueshu’s helplessness. Given the current situation, even if he had some dissatisfaction with Wu Chengyi, he could only endure it. If he and Shu Xiaoyu left this large group, their strength alone would likely lead to a quicker demise.

As he pondered, he finally understood why Shu Xiaoyu had been so surprised when he took out the healing pills earlier.

Over these past few months, this group must have encountered countless battles. Although everyone had spare pills, they must have run out long ago. At this moment, his healing pills appeared incredibly precious.
