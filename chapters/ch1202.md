## Chapter 1202 — Dragon Bone?

The reason Chang Qi and Hao An could not break through to the Origin Returning Realm was that they were stuck at a bottleneck, and the Haike Family had no means to purchase Origin Condensing Pills for them; without a special opportunity, they would spend their lives as Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and could never hope to touch the wonders of the Origin Returning Realm.

They had come to Flowing Flame Sandland partly to fulfill their agreement with Ian and partly to seek an opportunity to break through.

And now, this little tree before them could effortlessly help them clear that bottleneck—how could Chang Qi not be overjoyed?

At the thought that he and Old Hao could take that long-cherished step, Chang Qi could not help but shed aged tears.

Yang Kai had one more thing he had not told Chang Qi: the miracle of the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree was that it could help a martial artist overcome any bottleneck—whether in realm, in Martial Skill, or in Divine Sense—any hindrance blocking a warrior's progress it could sweep away, and the stronger the martial artist, the greater the benefit.

As martial artists cultivate and pursue the Heavenly Dao and martial way, advancement grows ever more difficult; it's not only an accumulation of time but an understanding of the Heavenly Dao. If breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm is so arduous, one can imagine how torturous surmounting the Void King Realm would be.

Yet the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree could help martial artists solve this very problem.

It would not be an exaggeration to call it a priceless treasure; in some respects it even surpassed the Warm Spirit Lotus. The Warm Spirit Lotus can only be used by one person, but the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree can be used by countless people.

"That explains why the plains above only grow weeds and no Spiritual Herbs or Spiritual Medicines," Yang Kai said with a calm smile.

Chang Qi asked reflexively, "Why?"

"Because where something like this exists there cannot possibly be Spiritual Herbs or Spiritual Medicines—the tree has already drained the heaven's fortune within a radius of hundreds of li..." Yang Kai said, then suddenly frowned.

Chang Qi evidently recalled something and hurriedly said, "But wasn't that Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object right here?"

Yang Kai glanced at him slowly and guessed, "Perhaps that was not actually a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object."

In any case, with the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree in hand, the matter of the Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object was pushed aside by Yang Kai and Chang Qi. Chang Qi did not dare touch this Heaven-and-Earth treasure for fear of breaking through here; Yang Kai had no scruples—he seized his golden sword, cut out a large chunk of the Saint Crystal vein containing the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, and tossed it straight into the Black Book Space.

His Spatial Ring contained only unimportant things; the important items were all hidden in the Black Book Space.

"Guest Elder." Yang Kai said, "I'll take this for now. When you return I'll give it back to you; it will surely help you break through to the Origin Returning Realm." After all, the thing had been found by Chang Qi—though Yang Kai was tempted, he would not claim it as his own.

Chang Qi hurriedly waved his hand, a trace of satisfaction on his face. "You need not be so formal. I'm not unaware of its value, but my own people know our affairs—such a treasure is not something I am qualified to possess; having it might be more calamity than blessing. I'm old; this life I only wish to break through to the Origin Returning Realm and expect nothing more. When Old Hao and I were at our most desperate, Yang Kai, you helped us. If you had not stood up, we would never have had the chance to enter Flowing Flame Sandland; if you had not brought me here I could not have come. You take the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree. When we get out, let Old Hao and me train beside it for a while and that will suffice."

Hearing him say that, Yang Kai no longer stood on ceremony and said directly, “Very well. In the future, you and Guest Elder Hao may come to Dragon Lair Mountain together. You’ll live far more comfortably than you ever did with the Haike Family, and breaking through to the Void King Realm will not be impossible.”

Chang Qi laughed heartily. "Let's take that as a future goal."

He clearly held no great hopes—having not yet broken through to the Origin Returning Realm, how could he dream of the Void King Realm? Moreover, Dark Star had not seen a Void King Realm expert in countless years; he did not think he could shatter that fetter.

Yang Kai said no more; he would set his sights on the Void King Realm regardless. If Dark Star would not do, he would go to the cultivation stars beyond—he would not be trapped here! When the time came, he would take them all with him.

Having obtained the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, Yang Kai returned to his tunnel and buried himself in mining once more.

The whole underground cavern was silent, with only the sounds of excavation within the tunnels; whether the five from Qiantian Sect or Yang Kai and Chang Qi, all harvested great gains.

Time passed in the blink of an eye—four days went by.

Yang Kai had deepened his tunnel by more than thirty zhang; the Saint Crystals he obtained alone amounted to roughly three million pieces, yet he still had not found any trace of that little snake-like Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object.

Since a Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree appeared here, he was all the more curious about that little snake-like Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object—he wanted to know whether it had grown where the tree existed, or whether it had inadvertently delved in here to escape pursuit.

So he continued to dig inward.

Two more days later, Yang Kai frowned tightly, secretly wondering if he should give up.

He had entered Flowing Flame Sandland mainly to refine Profound Yin Moon Water; the First Layer's Heat-Flame Zone had not met his requirements, so he did not linger there—he intended to check the Heat-Flame Zone behind the heaven-and-earth treasure area. Now, wasting time here seemed hardly worth it.

Saint Crystals were fine, but Yang Kai felt that if he wanted Saint Crystals he could obtain them easily elsewhere; there was no need to waste time here.

After pondering for a while, Yang Kai made a plan: he would dig for two more days, and after that, regardless of the outcome, he would leave.

Perhaps luck was truly on his side; half a day after he made his decision, when he unearthed a large Saint Crystal, he immediately felt an extraordinary aura overflow from the crystal before him.

The aura was strange—thin yet containing a kind of majesty!

Under that aura, Yang Kai even felt his heart race, as if some pair of eyes in the dark were watching him, ready at any moment to end him.

This made his heart go cold; he promptly immersed his mind to resist that inexplicable majesty.

In an instant his whole body felt light; on closer inspection his expression turned strange.

He was very familiar with that majestic aura—it was not the majesty of the World-Ending Demon Eye but the sensation produced when the golden-dragon pattern on his body manifested into a form; though somewhat different, it was essentially the same.

Something abnormal had occurred, and Yang Kai immediately grew excited, quickening his movements; one Saint Crystal after another was tossed into his Spatial Ring.

As he went deeper, that majestic aura grew ever clearer and more intense.

Yang Kai even felt a blaze of heat along his body—not from any other cause, but because the golden-dragon pattern was now moving on him as if alive; at his ear he could faintly hear a lofty dragon cry.

Not only that, the Ice Phoenix pattern long imprinted on him, though previously useless, seemed stimulated as well and answered with a resonant phoenix cry.

Whatever lay within had actually stirred the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress legacies into agitation.

Some ten or so zhang further in, as Yang Kai cut away a Saint Crystal, a streak of cyan light suddenly erupted ahead, bathing the whole tunnel in an eerie green.

Yang Kai immediately squinted; his Saint Yuan swelled to resist the fierce pressure from ahead. For an instant his breathing grew strained, and he felt as if trapped in a quagmire, unable to move.

Yang Kai's face changed dramatically, but the feeling vanished the next moment as if it had been an illusion; only the cyan light orb grew ever more dazzling.

He craned his head forward, astonishment written across Yang Kai's face.

In the tunnel he had excavated there was a sealed chamber, not large—only about three zhang across—and inside lay a round pearl the size of a dove's egg. The pearl was colorless, but within a verdant little snake swam, seemingly possessing its own spirit; seeing Yang Kai's gaze it swam faster, lively and vivid.

From the little snake Yang Kai felt the presence of a soul!

It was certainly the little snake Chang Qi had chased before—the one Yang Kai had mistaken for a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object. But on closer inspection Yang Kai realized it truly was not a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object but a soul!

That explained why Chang Qi had found it by the Soul-Nurturing Flower: souls cannot persist for long, and periodically they must go to the Soul-Nurturing Flower to absorb its fragrance to stabilize themselves.

Unluckily, it was accidentally discovered by Chang Qi, and while fleeing it passed by Yang Kai and was pursued all the way here.

That majestic cyan light was emitted by the little snake, but it was clearly very weak now; it swam within the orb with little vigor, and its majestic aura flared only for a moment before dying down.

Its soul was incomplete—undoubtedly it had suffered some injury before and had little consciousness left. Yang Kai was curious what creature's soul it could be to be so remarkable.

Beside the round bead where the little serpent lay coiled rested a bone several feet long, as thick as an infant’s arm. It gleamed like a pillar of crystal jade, and though countless years had passed, not the slightest trace of decay could be seen. On the contrary, a fierce, awe-inspiring aura pulsed from within — a savage, primordial ferocity, as if some ancient behemoth had awakened for a single instant after slumbering for ten thousand years. Feeling that ominous intent, Yang Kai was secretly alarmed.

The bone was not human remains but the bone of a demonic beast.

"Could these be a Dragon Bone?" Yang Kai's eyes bulged.

Coupled with the earlier commotion from the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress legacies, an incredible thought surged through Yang Kai's mind.

Only that could explain why the Golden Dragon and Ice Phoenix patterns were so excited, and why the little snake inside the pearl looked abnormal—growing twin horns, even claws, and two whiskers on its chin; it was plainly the shrunken embryonic form of a legendary ancient dragon.

Yang Kai's heart pounded.

Even when he had acquired the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree a few days earlier he had not been this excited.

Because he himself encountered no real bottleneck in cultivation, the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree was merely icing on the cake for him, not essential; its greatest use was to provide breakthrough assistance to his friends and family.
