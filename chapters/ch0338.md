## Chapter 338 — Sacrificial Meinu

In an attempt of desperation, the old man could only lower his face and shout at Yang Kai.

Hearing this, many in Ghost King Valley couldn’t help but sneer, glancing mockingly at the old man.

Zhao Rong from Baoqi Sect even wore an unusual expression, whispering, "This old fool wanted to trap us just a moment ago, and now he comes begging. What thick skin!"

Everyone had witnessed the old man’s previous underhanded tactics, and though they were enraged, they dared not act out against him due to his powerful capabilities.

The old man observed everyone’s expressions but was unfazed, casually saying, “Young people, know that mountains and rivers converge. Perhaps you will need something from me soon. How about a personal favor? Help me a little; looking at your actions just now, it seems it wouldn’t cost you much effort.”

His tone was calm, but a glint of sharpness flashed in his eyes. Anyone could sense the threat in his words, laced with the implication that there would be consequences if assistance was refused.

Yang Kai chuckled coldly inside but maintained a serious expression on the outside, slowly shaking his head. “I can’t help you; my True Yuan is exhausted, and I need time to recover before I can fight again!”

As he spoke, he genuinely sat down cross-legged.

The people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect were startled and quickly retrieved their best Pills to restore True Yuan, handing them to Yang Kai for him to use.

It wasn’t that they were easily deceived; rather, their concern had led them to confusion.

Moreover, the commotion Yang Kai had caused definitely consumed a significant amount of True Yuan, and the energy contained in the protective barrier at the current Stage was enough to astound everyone. Anyone who expended so much True Yuan needed replenishment.

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er exchanged glances and stifled giggles.

They both knew that Yang Kai possessed a miraculous liquid to replenish True Yuan, so how could they believe his nonsense?

The commotion on the high platform caught the old man’s attention, making him unsure whether Yang Kai was speaking the truth or not. Consequently, he didn’t push further, though his smile didn’t reach his eyes as he said, “Fine, you can recover for now.”

With that, he focused on the battle in front of him.

On the high platform, people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect were astonished, not expecting that amidst such chaos, Yang Kai could create a truly safe haven.

They watched the battle on the other side with keen interest, whispering critiques, which left Yu Qing and his group infuriated, their blood boiling.

The old man was indeed a master of the Divine Roaming Realm, with an endless supply of True Yuan. His movements appeared unremarkable but were, in fact, extremely powerful. He could single-handedly contend with four Evil Spirits without falling behind.

In the midst of battle, he tried his best to protect his three juniors. Conversely, the people from Xiaoyao Sect seemed like orphans, lacking any care and support, fighting valiantly but rapidly depleting their True Yuan.

Yu Qing’s pale face turned even whiter, while the scantily clad Meinu could no longer afford to flaunt themselves, each beaded with fragrant sweat and exhausting themselves in the struggle.

Outside the True Yang Yuan Qi defensive barrier, the Evil Spirits continually circled, seeking weaknesses, but no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t find any exploitable gaps.

Before long, they abandoned their attack here and flew toward the old man's side of the high platform.

In an instant, danger loomed heavily over that side, and the old man let out an angry roar, fully unleashing his strength accompanied by an array of treasures and Martial Skills.

The people of Xiaoyao Sect were at a loss but couldn’t handle so many Evil Spirits.

“Senior, Senior!” Yu Qing shouted desperately, “Help us!”

Though Xiaoyao Sect had numbers comparable to Ghost King Valley, their expertise in intimate matters—and thereby their cultivation—was jumbled and incoherent because both men and women engaged in it, leaving their True Yuan insufficient to manage this chaotic scene. With the defense on the brink of collapse, Yu Qing had no choice but to call for help.

“Heh heh!” The old man chuckled darkly, “I can hardly spare a hand myself. How could I find time to save you?”

Yu Qing cursed internally, knowing that this old fool wasn’t easy to deal with, hastily saying, “If you can save our lives, our Xiaoyao Sect will surely repay you generously!”

“Let’s hear it!” A glint flashed in the old man’s eyes.

“If we can survive and return, each of us can gift you a Meinu! You must be aware of their value given your familiarity with Xiaoyao Sect’s methods!” At this life-and-death juncture, Yu Qing could no longer afford to hold back and stated the generous terms directly.

Upon hearing this, a lewd light flashed in the old man’s eyes, and he grinned broadly, “I naturally know that your Xiaoyao Sect’s Meinus can deliver all their Essence to the man they engage with through a special Cultivation Method!”

“Exactly!” Yu Qing nodded eagerly.

The old man laughed heartily, “Not bad. You have four people; if I can drain the Essence from four Meinues, my own strength will increase significantly.”

“Senior understands well.” With urgency, Yu Qing cursed the old man for being so difficult but dared not show it; he could only manage a dry laugh. “We ask for your assistance!”

The old man snorted coldly, “But I’ve heard that each man from your Xiaoyao Sect has more than one Meinu. You seem to have a high status; you at least must have four or five, right?”

Yu Qing's expression darkened, realizing just how greedy this old man was.

“You're quite fortunate, young one!” The old man leered, “Here’s the deal. I can help as much as possible, but I demand eight Meinues! That’s two from each of you in return; only then will it be worth my effort to step in! Agree or not, you decide, but... heh heh, if you’re dead, what good are so many Meinus to you?”

That last sentence struck Yu Qing where it hurt the most, darkening his face. He barely hesitated before quickly nodding, “Alright, it’s a deal!”

“You’re decisive enough; that’s the hallmark of someone who can achieve great things!” The old man laughed heartily, suddenly ramping up his ferocity, enveloping the people from Xiaoyao Sect in the aftermath of his strikes. With his involvement, Yu Qing and the others instantly felt a significant sense of relief.

Worth it, Yu Qing reassured himself, feeling his earlier anxiety begin to fade.

Though each male disciple of Xiaoyao Sect possessed multiple Meinus, raising them still required time. Sending out two each was still a tremendous loss for them.

While Yu Qing negotiated with the old man, the Meinus remained utterly indifferent as if these matters had no relevance to them.

“Keep your word. If you dare renege... I will wipe out your entire Xiaoyao Sect!” The old man ominously warned.

Yu Qing’s heart skipped a beat. Uncertain of this old man’s background, he quickly responded with ingratiating laughter, “Dare not! Once a gentleman gives his word, not even four horses could drag it back!”

Many people secretly sneered.

If Yu Qing was a gentleman, then perhaps no scoundrel would remain in the world.

On the other high platform, Yang Kai and the others observed coldly, the thrill of surviving earlier fading in this environment. It was hard to feel joy.

They had no idea when these Evil Spirits would recede, giving rise to an overwhelming sense of anxiety.

Meanwhile, the old man continued to fight. Numerous Evil Spirits fell beneath his blows, and enough Evil Spirit essences floated around him. Yet none had the time to collect them, and gradually these essences fell to the ground, merging into the malevolent springs.

Suddenly, the old man’s expression changed, and he shouted angrily, “Xiaoyao Sect, hurry up and sacrifice your Meinus!”

His tone was urgent and left no room for refutation.

“Ah…” Yu Qing froze, looking at the old man in surprise, unsure why he would say such a thing suddenly.

“Move quickly if you don’t want to die!” The old man pressed, a hint of malice surfacing on his face.

“But…” Yu Qing didn’t understand the old man’s intentions, and seeking to sacrifice the Meinus at such a time was unwise. Their numbers were already sparse; if Meinus were sacrificed, it would halve the Xiaoyao Sect’s already reduced number.

He naturally couldn’t muster the resolve.

“I give you three breaths’ time. If you don’t sacrifice them, I will kill them!” The old man issued the final ultimatum with an icy glare.

“Senior Brother, what should we do?” The male disciples of Xiaoyao Sect looked at Yu Qing with anxious and helpless expressions.

“Sacrifice!” Yu Qing, angry and unwilling, dared not hesitate any longer. Their lives hung by a thread thanks to the old man’s intermittent protection; should he turn on them, they would surely die.

Though he felt pained to sacrifice the Meinus, he had no choice.

Once Yu Qing gave the order, several male disciples of Xiaoyao Sect unleashed powerful moves to repel the encroaching Evil Spirits, then each embraced the nearby Meinus. Under the sweet, tender gazes of the Meinus, they kissed deeply.

Leng Shan displayed an expression of unwillingness, turning her head away. She quietly tugged Zhao Rong and the Hu sisters, whispering, “Don’t look!”

“What’s wrong?” Zhao Rong asked, puzzled.

Leng Shan clearly knew what would follow the sacrifice of Meinus and gently reminded them.

Shen Yi also sighed faintly, his expression revealing a hint of sorrow. The majority of Ghost King Valley disciples lowered their heads, unable to look directly at the scene unfolding.

Despite their long-standing conflicts with Xiaoyao Sect and frequent battles with their Meinus, they couldn’t help but feel sympathy for those who had been enslaved, their humanity stripped away, reduced to mere tools.

It wasn’t because they lacked self-respect nor innate lust, but rather due to the special methods used by the men of Xiaoyao Sect.

Women were inherently curious. Though Leng Shan urged them not to look, Zhao Rong and the Hu sisters couldn’t help but glance over.

What met their eyes caused their hearts to race.

Before them, as deep kisses were exchanged in passionate fervor, circles of ripples erupted from within the bodies of the Meinus. As the ripples spread, their youthful beauty hastily aged, and their delicate forms became visibly withered, as if years of life slipped away in an instant.

From their mouths, the True Yuan and vitality of these Meinues transformed into energy, flowing eagerly into the men of Xiaoyao Sect.

The pale-faced disciples of Xiaoyao Sect, who had appeared weak and drained, instantly flushed with color, looking radiant and handsome, robust and exceptional.

Even their strength surged explosively.
