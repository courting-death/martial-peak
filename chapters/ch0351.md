## Chapter 351 — Taifang Mountain

Taifang Mountain, stretching from north to south, is a range of hills that is neither too large nor too small on this vast land.

Originally, this mountain range was considered a place of exquisite beauty, with swaying trees, lush greenery, and the sweet sounds of birds and fragrant flowers. But at this moment, the entire mountain range had become a battlefield.

To the south of the mountain gathered the forces of Cangyun Evil Land, while to the north assembled the forces besieging Cangyun Evil Land.

The two sides, separated by the mountain, regarded the entire range as a battlefield. Over the past few months, Taifang Mountain had suffered severe destruction, with bloodshed and corpses strewn everywhere. Countless martial artists had perished here.

Scenes of standoffs like this were not rare elsewhere.

Taifang Mountain was merely one point on the entire frontline!

Since leaving Cangyun Evil Land, the Sisters from the Hu Family had rushed here, as the troops of Blood Battle Gang had been dispatched to fight in this location.

They had originally been here, chased by masters, unable to return, and had to take refuge in Cangyun Evil Land.

Along the way, Yang Kai learned a lot of useful information from them.

The battle on the Taifang Mountain front was not too significant, so there weren’t many experts gathered here. Besides their Blood Battle Gang, there were also people from Fengyu Tower, along with elites from several second-rate forces, all under the command of a first-rate noble clan.

The surname of this clan was Xiang!

Since the people here came from all corners of the world, most of them hailed from second and third-rate forces, thus the Xiang clan’s leadership was absolute.

Even if some were unwilling, they still had to obey the orders from the Xiang clan. After all, their foundation was indeed richer.

At a defensible yet hard-to-attack area at the foot of Taifang Mountain, many rudimentary shelters had been built. This was where the martial artists besieging Cangyun Evil Land rested.

On this day, a man and two women arrived from outside, looking travel-worn.

Before they could approach, they were stopped by a few brightly dressed individuals, who shouted to inquire about the identities of the three.

Seeing that Yang Kai and the Sisters from the Hu Family did not appear very strong, they did not take them seriously and simply regarded the questioning as a routine.

However, their eyes kept wandering over the charming figures of the Sisters from the Hu Family. But upon realizing their status, the glances shifted to expressions of disgust.

Yang Kai wore an indifferent expression, remaining silent.

Instead, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er quickly wiped the disguises off their faces to reveal their true looks.

After wiping, although their faces were still somewhat grimy, they finally exhibited some of the charm of beauties.

The group that had obstructed them stared blankly for a moment and suddenly exclaimed, “You are the young ladies of Blood Battle Gang?”

“Yes!” Hu Jiao’er replied faintly.

“So it's you!” The leader of the group revealed a joyful expression, excitedly saying, “It's so good that you two are safe and sound, please come in.”

As he spoke, he stepped aside, his demeanor suddenly becoming humble: “We were just carrying out routine duties; please don’t take it to heart, young ladies.”

Hu Jiao’er frowned slightly. Her expression was indifferent as she led her sister and Yang Kai to pass through.

However, the group eyed Yang Kai suspiciously, and the leader cautiously asked, “May I ask, young ladies, who is this…?”

“My friend.”

“Oh, since he is your friend, then that’s fine.” The person smiled and did not question further, allowing them to pass.

Once the three entered and disappeared from sight, the leader instructed solemnly, “Go tell the young master that the sisters from the Hu Family have returned safely. Hurry!”

“Oh!” One person received the order and immediately darted out.

Yang Kai followed behind the Sisters from the Hu Family, weaving through this area until they soon arrived at the depths.

“Over there!” Hu Mei’er suddenly exclaimed with delight, pointing in a direction.

Following her gesture, Yang Kai saw that a group of people was gathered, seemingly discussing something.

“It’s Uncle Le!” Hu Jiao’er also broke into a smile, hurriedly walking over.

The group noticed someone approaching and all turned to look in their direction.

The next moment, a man who appeared to be in his fifties rose shakily, his eyes reddening as he stared blankly at the Sisters from the Hu Family, his old gaze filled with joy.

Guan Chile, a master of the Divine Roaming Realm, Fourth Stage, was a strong member of Blood Battle Gang. He had also participated in the great battle against Meng Wuya back in the day.

However, unlike Long Zaitian, Guan Chile was incredibly loyal to Blood Battle Gang and to the Hu Family. He had watched the Sisters from the Hu Family grow up, so their relationship was quite good.

“Are you the two young ladies?” Guan Chile hesitantly asked.

“It’s us, Uncle Le!” Hu Jiao’er beamed brightly.

“You really came back safely!” Guan Chile was instantly moved to tears.

The group around him also looked at the Sisters from the Hu Family with surprise and joy. The sisters had disappeared for two to three months, having last been seen on Taifang Mountain being pursued. Everyone had expected them to have met with a grim fate, yet here they returned unscathed.

Since those gathered had good relationships with each other, it was only natural that the return of the Sisters from the Hu Family would bring them happiness.

This group was not numerous, only a dozen individuals, but when Yang Kai swept his gaze over them, they all looked familiar!

Either they were from Blood Battle Gang or disciples of Fengyu Tower!

Moreover, Yang Kai even spotted Fang Ziqi among them!

This fellow, who was extremely biased towards males, had also been dragged here to fight.

Both factions had come from the same place, compelled to participate in this battle, so it was not surprising that they gathered closely together.

“It’s good that you’re back, good that you’re back. The gang leader can relax now.” Guan Chile quickly composed himself, nodding in relief. When he turned his gaze to Yang Kai, he couldn’t help but squint, questioning with suspicion, “Have I seen this young man somewhere before?”

The Sisters from the Hu Family were at a loss for how to explain.

If only this group knew Yang Kai’s identity, it wouldn’t matter, but there were also martial artists from other forces nearby. If they realized Yang Kai came from Lingxiao Pavilion, things would become complicated.

Fang Ziqi, however, looked at Yang Kai with deep meaning, quickly stepping forward and clearing his throat, wearing a strange smile as he clasped his fists, “Fengyu Tower’s Fang Ziqi. My friend here looks very much like an old acquaintance of mine. May I ask your name?”

“Yang Kai!” Yang Kai chuckled inwardly, but maintained a serious expression.

“So it’s Brother Yang. A pleasure! Not only do you resemble my old acquaintance, but your name does too, haha! Don’t you think so?” Fang Ziqi heavily slapped the shoulder of a junior brother next to him.

“Yes… Yes…” That junior brother nodded helplessly, unaware of why things had become so mysterious.

Everyone suddenly understood Fang Ziqi's intentions, each with a strange expression.

Guan Chile, being experienced, suddenly realized after hearing Yang Kai's name. No wonder he felt somewhat familiar; it turned out to be him!

Everyone tacitly understood yet chose not to break the silence.

The atmosphere was harmonious, but Yang Kai keenly noticed that beneath the smile and relief of the Blood Battle Gang master, there lurked a hint of worry and urgency.

As they spoke, Fang Ziqi’s expression suddenly turned cold, his gaze flickering, and a careless smile curved his lips as he said, “Xiang Chu has arrived.”

With that, he fixed his burning gaze on the Sisters from the Hu Family.

The group suddenly fell silent. Guan Chile's expression darkened, and he appeared displeased.

Yang Kai turned to look and saw not far away a young man, handsome and well-dressed, striding this way accompanied by two masters of the Divine Roaming Realm.

His attire was neat, a warm smile adorning his face, and he was quite good-looking, radiating a youthful demeanor.

From his appearance, he seemed to be around twenty-six or twenty-seven years old.

Xiang Chu!

The young master of the Xiang clan, which was a first-rate noble family. Naturally, Xiang Chu's status and position were not low, comparable to the likes of Bai Yunfeng and Dong Qinghan, both of whom were prominent figures of the younger generation.

Over the past month, Yang Kai had heard the name Xiang Chu mentioned several times from the Sisters from the Hu Family, but each time they rushed through it, unwilling to elaborate.

Now seeing him in person and witnessing the look in his eyes, Yang Kai finally understood why the Sisters from the Hu Family were reluctant to discuss him.

Not only did the Sisters from the Hu Family feel this way, but also the members of Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower seemed to have no kind expressions towards him.

Nonetheless, Xiang Chu continued to smile warmly as he approached.

Reaching them, he stopped and his eyes sparkled with relief as he gently called, “Jiao’er, Mei’er, welcome back from afar; you must have had a tiring journey.”

Guan Chile, with narrowed eyes, made the two masters of the Divine Roaming Realm behind Xiang Chu immediately focus their attention on him.

Hu Jiao’er frowned, her expression calm as she said, “Young Master Xiang, Jiao’er and Mei’er are not people you can casually address. Need I remind you again?”

Xiang Chu’s expression froze, as if he recalled something. He chuckled awkwardly and clasped his fists, saying, “Forgive me, young ladies. After so long apart, I was emotional and spoke out of turn.”

“Let’s hope there won’t be a next time!” Hu Jiao’er coldly sniffed.

“Of course, of course! I guarantee there won’t be a next time.” Xiang Chu nodded repeatedly, followed by a long sigh, his brow furrowed, “However, I must apologize to the two young ladies first.”

“Oh?” Hu Jiao’er slightly furrowed her brows, looking at him indifferently.

Xiang Chu smiled bitterly, “During that battle, the two young ladies fell into a dire situation. I should have gone to help, but my skills were lacking, and I could only watch you both being pursued by those rogues... It’s been two to three months since you two left; every time I think of it, my heart is like being cut by knives. I wished I had wings to fly to your side and ensure your safety.”

Suddenly, he smiled brilliantly, “Fortunately, the two of you are blessed and have returned today, so I can rest easy now.”

His smile was sincere, reminiscent of the brightness breaking through the clouds.

However, the Sisters from the Hu Family remained indifferent.

Unfazed, Xiang Chu clasped his fists, saying, “Since you have returned from afar, you must be weary. It would be best to rest early; we can speak again another day. Should you need anything, just tell me, and I will certainly assist you!”

With that, he smiled gracefully and departed.
