## Chapter 1242 — Refinement

A day later, Yang Kai opened his eyes.

That day of recuperation and meditation had tuned his condition to its peak; then he began incessantly waving his hands, and one by one delicate jade bottles and rare medicinal herbs soon spread around him, each saturated with oppressive Spiritual Qi.

These were the auxiliary materials needed when refining the Profound Yin Moon Water, and Zong Ao had told him so; Yang Kai had already gathered them back on Rainfall Star.

After all, although these materials were rare and precious, Yang Kai had picked many herbs on the Floating Continent, and later had ransacked the warehouses of the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch on Rainfall Star, so assembling them had not taken much trouble.

Zong Ao had said that refining the Profound Yin Moon Water was best attempted at the Origin Returning Realm, because only warriors who had reached that cultivation could bear the agony of the process.

Yang Kai chose to begin at the Saint King Realm entirely out of supreme confidence in himself.

Whether in terms of bodily strength, the cultivation of his Divine Sense, or the robustness and purity of his Saint Yuan, he felt no inferiority to any Origin Returning Realm cultivator; aside from lacking comprehension of the power of Shi, he was not far behind Origin Returning Realm practitioners. Moreover, his tenacity and endurance were unmatched—otherwise he would never have fused the Indomitable Golden Body of the Great Demon God when he was so weak, nor have gleaned that strange Martial Skill called Unyielding Will.

So he did not worry about his cultivation level at all; what he needed to consider now was how to extract the Profound Yin Moon Water's miraculous properties to the fullest.

Zong Ao had said this stuff could greatly elevate a cultivator's realm without any later trouble. Yang Kai already felt the inadequacy of his First Stage of the Saint King Realm; if he could raise his cultivation quickly, he'd gain far more leverage.

He had no fears about foundation, mindset, or his grasp of the Martial Dao.

His root foundation was unusually stable; even if his realm soared this time, it wouldn't unsettle his fundamentals and cause future difficulties. As for mindset, he had nothing to worry about either. Having absorbed so much soul energy from other warriors, Yang Kai's state of mind long since exceeded that of a Saint King Realm cultivator, and likewise his comprehension of the Martial Dao had left his peers far behind.

Now that everything was ready, he naturally would not remain idle.

Though well prepared, Yang Kai still inspected the various materials placed around him one by one; only after ensuring nothing was missing did he nod slightly. Then he took out several Golden Sun Fruit and set them aside.

These Golden Sun Fruit were what he and Daiyuan had obtained in the Flowing Flame Sandland; they contained extremely potent Yang attribute energy and were perfect to take at a time like this.

With all preparations complete, Yang Kai's expression suddenly turned grave; he reached out and issued a Saint Yuan into a nearby stone pedestal. After the stone absorbed the Saint Yuan, its surface flashed, and the array within the stone chamber—long since dormant—roared back to life.

After a moment, a stream of pure fire-type Spiritual Qi was drawn from the Earth-Lung Fire Pool and poured into the place where Yang Kai sat.

The condensed, tangible fire Spiritual Qi instantly spread, enveloping Yang Kai and shamelessly surging into his body. His expression unchanged, he clenched his teeth against the bone-drilling pain; rather than resisting, he opened himself completely—every pore dilated to permit the fire Spiritual Qi's entry.

Soon his clothes were completely burned away, revealing a powerful physique; solid muscles stood out clearly, his skin gleamed with a golden light, and the surface began to crack, bleeding golden blood that, thanks to its restorative power, repeatedly mended the broken places in a continuous cycle.

Yang Kai closed his hand and the jade bottle on the ground was drawn to him; he opened it and poured out a crimson pill, tossing it straight into his mouth and closing his eyes to refine the pill's medicinal effects.

An hour later the pill's effects had dissipated and flooded every inch of his flesh; he then took a dark-red Spiritual Herb and chewed it down in great mouthfuls.

One after another, different pills and herbs, even the Golden Sun Fruit he had set aside, were taken in stages.

The entire process lasted three full days and nights.

Each time he consumed a material, the fire-light on his body grew denser, the heat emanating from him became terrifyingly intense—enough to make onlookers blanch.

Every inch of his muscles was twitching and writhing, his face twisted into a hideous grimace, and his eyes were blood-red, as if he were about to devour someone alive. Though his condition looked utterly miserable, Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense still kept his mind clear—he couldn’t tell whether that was a blessing or a curse.

In clear-headed moments Yang Kai felt the consumed pills and herbs transform into surges of medicinal force that crashed and fused within his meridians and flesh, producing subtle, incredible changes—like billions of ants racing about inside him—an agony beyond what a Saint King Realm cultivator could bear.

No wonder Zong Ao had insisted a thousand times that Yang Kai mustn't be greedy and attempt the Profound Yin Moon Water before reaching the Origin Returning Realm—the old man had not been speaking idly. Yang Kai's heart brimmed with sentiment.

This current pain alone would be enough to break most Origin Returning Realm practitioners; and this was only the beginning—if not for his Golden Blood's powerful regenerative ability, he'd likely have had to stop, and continuing would have blown his body apart.

All the materials Yang Kai consumed were Yang-attribute and fire-attribute pills and herbs. Combined with the earthfire here, unimaginable scorching power had concentrated within him—the torment he endured was self-evident.

Yang Kai opened his eyes again, raised a trembling hand, and poured Saint Yuan into a second stone pillar.

Haa…

There was a sound as the chamber's array sped up; the earthfire drawn from the Earth-Lung Fire Pool increased manyfold.

At that, Yang Kai could no longer endure; a piteous howl escaped him, and he felt his spirits ease somewhat.

Leaving no room for sluggishness, Yang Kai continuously forced his Saint Yuan, coalescing the chaotic medicinal effects within to fully erupt and penetrate his flesh.

Three more days passed before Yang Kai managed to fuse all the restless, nearly frenzied medicinal forces within him, suppressing them into his meridians.

He immediately took out a jade bottle with a solemn face, stared for a moment, then resolutely opened it; with a slight shake, a gem-like, crystal-clear drop suddenly flew out.

The instant that drop flew free, the furnace-hot stone chamber was pervaded by an abrupt chill.

Visible to the naked eye, the fiery Spiritual Qi in the surrounding space scattered as if fleeing from a venomous serpent, unable to approach within three feet of that single drop of liquid. The liquid itself was equally strange—after Yang Kai flicked it out, it showed no sign of falling, but instead floated quietly before him like a feather.

Profound Yin Moon Water!

A treasure so coveted that even Void King Realm experts lusted for it—Yang Kai had as many as twenty drops in hand.

Seeing that drop of Profound Yin Moon Water, Yang Kai couldn't help but think of Xue Yue, that enchantress! At the time this man-eating woman had been frostbitten by Profound Yin Moon Water; it had taken him a great deal of struggle to bring her back.

If she had not been bound by a Soul Chain, Yang Kai wouldn't have bothered about her fate—after all, they were enemies rather than friends then.

When Yang Kai finally left Rainfall Star, the Hengluo Commerce Guild had even sent people to hunt him down.

He slowly shook his head, dispelling those distractions, and without hesitation opened his mouth to swallow that drop of Profound Yin Moon Water.

An ice-cold, bone-piercing chill spread from his mouth, threatening to freeze his flesh; even his Sea of Consciousness filled with cold. At that moment, however, a burst of scorching heat flared up from within Yang Kai, instantly dispelling the cold.

Yet the energy contained in the Profound Yin Moon Water was terrifyingly potent; as the chill subsided, still more cold began to spread throughout his body.

In the next instant, an uninterrupted barrage of scorching force also detonated.

Cold and heat made Yang Kai's body a battlefield where they collided incessantly; neither vanished, and instead they produced extraordinary, mysterious changes.

Yang Kai's expressions shifted in a split second—endless groans and hisses tore from deep in his throat as veins bulged on his forehead in a ghastly display.

Back on Rainfall Star, Halika—who had reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—had been injured by Profound Yin Moon Water and had to sever an arm to survive. If Yang Kai hadn't taken so many Yang-attribute and fire-attribute pills and Spiritual Herbs to temper the scorching within, that single drop of Profound Yin Moon Water alone would have killed him instantly.

The first challenge in refining Profound Yin Moon Water is to suppress the scalding forces from the pills and herbs; if the body isn't sturdy enough and the Divine Sense not resilient enough, one can't temporarily store such immense heat inside, and there can be no following steps.

The second challenge was exactly what Yang Kai faced now: he had to remain constantly lucid and maximize the fusion of the ice-and-fire forces into himself.

If he failed, the least was grievous injury, the worst the obliteration of his body—consequences dire.

The chamber echoed with Yang Kai's wounded-beast howls, and his condition was strange—sometimes his whole body shook from the cold, blue lips spreading chill about, at other times sweat streamed and his body flushed red as if roasted.

Amidst the alternation of cold and heat, Yang Kai was astonished to find his cultivation advancing at a terrifying speed; not only was his realm rising, but his Demonic Flame also seemed to undergo subtle changes.

The Demonic Flame itself was a mutant force of coexisting cold and heat, formed from Yang Kai's unique Saint Yuan. The environment created by refining the Profound Yin Moon Water matched the flame's attributes, unexpectedly stimulating his Saint Yuan to gradually change—this was something neither Yang Kai nor probably even Zong Ao had anticipated.
