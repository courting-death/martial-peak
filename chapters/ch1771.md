## Chapter 1771 — How Could It Be You

Yang Kai immediately recognized that the figure shrouded in darkness was the Void King Realm expert he had watched for some time before.

This man had seemed to take notice of him even before entering the Lost Realm, and Ni Guang had also warned that he was dangerous — someone best not provoked lightly.

Yang Kai never expected to encounter him here, and moreover the man had used a technique to trap his prey; the black veil enclosing the Jingkong Beast was clearly the other party's Secret Treasure.

However, that Secret Treasure exuded an all-pervading wickedness; it was obviously the sort of treasure that required sacrificing many lives to temper—clearly its owner was no benevolent person, and the number of people who had died at his hands was likely countless.

Yang Kai's brow tightened.

This situation was not a good one for him; though with his background he was not overly afraid of this man, the Jingkong Beast was now trapped within the range of the man's Secret Treasure.

He had worked so hard to maim the Jingkong Beast, and now someone else was going to take the credit—this was intolerable to Yang Kai.

Yet if he rashly rushed into that black veil to seize the Jingkong Beast's Inner Core, it would likely be unwise.

Being unafraid of the man and confident that he could escape under the other's nose did not mean he could directly clash with that Secret Treasure; if he charged in hotheadedly, Yang Kai reckoned his fate would be no better than the Jingkong Beast's.

What should he do?

How could he retrieve the Jingkong Beast's Inner Core without enraging the other? Yang Kai pondered desperately but could not find a suitable answer.

"Heh heh heh heh..." Just as Yang Kai's thoughts raced, the Void King Realm expert wrapped in shadow laughed meaningfully as if in a good mood, then he said, "Brat Yang, you've got quite the luck—having a beauty to accompany you in a place like this truly makes an old man envious."

At those words, Yang Kai's expression changed.

The other had called him by surname as soon as he spoke—clearly he recognized Yang Kai. Yet Yang Kai could not recall ever crossing paths with such a Void King Realm expert.

The number of Void King Realm experts he had met was not great, and he remembered each one; no one matched the man before him.

Yang Kai calmly stared at him and asked tentatively, "You know me, Elder?"

"Of course I know you. Heh heh, what, you've forgotten me?" the Void King Realm expert said in a teasing tone.

Yang Kai watched him and sensed no malice. After a brief pause he cupped his fist and said, "Forgive my poor eyesight for failing to recall you, Elder. Since you recognize me, why not show your true face?"

"It's only natural you wouldn't recognize me; my aura has changed greatly since those days!" The man, showing no impatience, nodded slightly. "Take a closer look and see who I am."

Saying so, the black qi that had wrapped him dispersed as swiftly as a receding tide.

The next moment, his face came into view before Yang Kai.

"Ah?" Yang Kai was startled and stared at him in amazement. "Elder Ghost Ancestor? How could it be you?"

Once the black qi cleared, he immediately recognized who the man was.

This Void King Realm expert was none other than the man who, when Yang Kai first entered the Star Domain, had been the first Void King he encountered—the one who claimed to be Ghost Ancestor and had been trapped on the Floating Continent for two thousand years.

Back then Ghost Ancestor had been swallowed by a void vortex and drifted to the Floating Continent, where he stayed for two thousand years; in that time he rose from the Saint King Realm to the Void King Realm, becoming a legend.

Yet on the Floating Continent he had been utterly alone for two thousand years, until Yang Kai and the others also fell there.

At that time Ghost Ancestor had been studying a Space Array and trying to use it to teleport off the Floating Continent; he had failed, and in the end they had relied on Yang Kai's mastery of spatial force to escape.

Seven people escaped together: apart from Ghost Ancestor and Yang Kai, there were Yue Xi and her two disciples, a son of Chairman Ai Ou of the Hengluo Commerce Guild named Shen Tu, and another woman.

Those past events faded like smoke, but they had been the first major thing Yang Kai experienced after entering the Star Domain—how could he forget?

Ghost Ancestor had been the first Void King Realm expert he met; the memory of him remained fresh.

He simply had not expected to run into him in a place like this.

Ghost Ancestor was ruthless and violent by nature, yet he kept promises; after Yang Kai saved him and they left the Floating Continent, Ghost Ancestor honorably let Yang Kai go and even gave him a Star Emperor Token as a token of thanks.

Without that Star Emperor Token, Yang Kai would not have been able to kill Luo Hai on Chi Lan Star.

So upon learning the man was Ghost Ancestor, Yang Kai's vigilance immediately eased and he grinned at Ghost Ancestor with a look of surprised pleasure.

“Isn’t it this old man himself!” Ghost Ancestor said, clearly in good spirits, letting out a series of eerie chuckles as he sized Yang Kai up and down. Nodding slightly, he clicked his tongue in amazement. “But you, boy, are truly astonishing. It hasn’t been that long, yet you’ve already cultivated to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm! If I recall correctly, back then you were only at the Saint Realm, weren’t you?”

"Second Stage of the Saint Realm!" Yang Kai replied with a grin. "Ghost Ancestor, you have a good memory."

Ghost Ancestor nodded. "Looks like your opportunities these years have been considerable! Otherwise you couldn't have achieved such advancement."

“Thanks to Elder’s blessing,” Yang Kai replied with a smile. “How have these years treated you, Elder?”

"How could I be? Just so-so, not like you young ones, all lovey-dovey," Ghost Ancestor teased, and glanced meaningfully at Xue Yue who slept behind Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave an awkward smile. "This was an accident."

After a moment Yang Kai suddenly asked, "By the way, Elder, did you avenge your great hatred?"

Ghost Ancestor had once said that after leaving the Floating Continent he intended to take revenge; before his drift to that place he had apparently been framed by a powerful force he could not confront at the time, and after ascending to the Void King Realm he swore to cleanse that humiliation.

Years had passed since then; Yang Kai wondered whether the vow had been fulfilled.

Ghost Ancestor's expression turned briefly solemn and he was silent for a long while before shaking his head. "My grievances are not so easily settled. What, you little brat want to help me?"

"Elder, you're joking," Yang Kai hastily waved his hand. "My strength is meager; how could I assist you? If I became a burden it would be an irredeemable disgrace."

He dared not agree lightly; though he and Ghost Ancestor had some acquaintance, he would not rashly meddle in such matters.

"Heh heh, I'm only joking, don't take it so seriously," Ghost Ancestor laughed. "But you needn't belittle yourself—you managed to wound that Jingkong Beast badly; I have some idea of your strength."

Yang Kai scratched his nose and said nothing in reply.

While they spoke, the Jingkong Beast had been tormented beyond recognition: countless Yin-Soul-like human faces gnawed at it, devouring its blood and flesh and draining its body thin. No matter how it crashed about, it could not break free of the black veil; all resistance proved futile.

By then the Jingkong Beast's screams had grown faint and its struggles gradually diminished.

After a while the Jingkong Beast finally fell still; only the multitude of Yin-Soul faces howled and swirled within the black veil, a terrifying sight.

Ghost Ancestor gestured and the black veil spun into a black banner, which flew back into his hand.

Seeing the black banner, Yang Kai suddenly understood.

He had seen Ghost Ancestor use a similar banner back on the Floating Continent, but it had not possessed such power then; evidently over the years Ghost Ancestor had found some method to temper the Secret Treasure and greatly increase its potency.

As the black banner returned, the all-encompassing veil vanished, leaving only the Jingkong Beast's desiccated carcass; its fur ground to dust in the wind, exposing brittle bones.

The bones themselves crumbled into dust under external pressure.

In the pile of dust remained a single round object about the size of a fist, emitting an odd luster.

Yang Kai's eyes shone and his gaze burned as he stared at it.

Ghost Ancestor chuckled, reached out, and with a flick sent the object flying toward Yang Kai. "If you want it, just say so—what's there to be shy about?"

Overjoyed, Yang Kai caught it and examined it in his palm. Confirming it was indeed the Jingkong Beast's Inner Core and that it remained intact with no leakage of energy, he smiled and said, "Thank you, Elder!"

“It was yours to begin with!” Ghost Ancestor said indifferently. “This old man knows you’re well-versed in the Dao of Space, so of course I kept this Inner Core for you. With it, your comprehension of spatial power should deepen even further, shouldn’t it?”

Yang Kai did not hide it and nodded. "Yes, my purpose in coming was the Jingkong Beast's Inner Core. Now my wish is fulfilled."

"You sure have guts to come into such a ghostly place," Ghost Ancestor said with some admiration as he looked at Yang Kai. "Since you've gotten what you wanted, perhaps you can help me get what I want?"

"What does Elder need? If I can, I'll certainly do it," Yang Kai said earnestly after carefully storing the Jingkong Beast's Inner Core.

Though Ghost Ancestor was not exactly a good man, he left a favorable impression on Yang Kai; after this meeting Ghost Ancestor seemed affable and amiable, so Yang Kai returned the favor.
