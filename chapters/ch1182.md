## Chapter 1182 — Flowing Flame Fireblaze

In the valley, Yang Kai stared at Xie Jun with an expression of cold indifference; he did not kill him at once but said, “Tell me. How did you know I was here? Don’t say it was chance — the Flowing Flame Sandland is vast. Without a special method you couldn’t have kept tracking me. If your answer satisfies me, I’ll leave you a whole corpse.”

His face suddenly hardened, and in a cold voice he added, “But if you dare hide anything, I will show you what it means to be worse off than dead. Believe me, I can bring you back to consciousness, then slowly torment you!”

Xie Jun forced a bitter smile and took deep breaths before saying, “It’s simple. A disciple of Yingyue Hall tipped us off and told us where you entered. Everyone followed the Yuan Magnetic Pointer and headed into the Flowing Flame Sandland; once we could confirm the spot you entered, tailing you wasn’t difficult. And the one you killed, Xie Yong, was an expert tracker.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, thinking this was about what he had expected.

After discovering that the ambushers were Xie Hongwen and two others, Yang Kai had already formed some guesses.

Since entering the Flowing Flame Sandland he had only encountered two people, and that was right when he first came in: one wearing Yingyue Hall’s robes — clearly a Yingyue Hall disciple — and another man Yang Kai didn’t recognize, though his voice had seemed familiar.

Yang Kai figured that for Xie Hongwen and his fellows to catch up so quickly there must have been someone tipping them off, and that person had to be one of the two who had seen his position earlier.

Seeing the truth unfold now, it made sense: the Yingyue Hall disciple had looked odd the moment he entered the Flowing Flame Sandland and found Yang Kai. Clearly Xie Hongwen had warned him ahead of time, which explained why he hurried away — he was off to report to Xie Hongwen.

Yang Kai was certain Xie Hongwen hadn’t only spoken to that one person; some seventy Yingyue Hall disciples had entered the Flowing Flame Sandland, and among them many would be tempted by wealth.

Money has always swayed men’s hearts.

“Make it quick,” Xie Jun said, then calmly lay down on the ground, motionless.

Yang Kai flicked a finger and a burst of force shot out, piercing Xie Jun’s forehead.

He was a man of his word; having promised to leave him a whole corpse, he naturally would not burn him with Demonic Flame.

Yang Kai bent and picked up the heavy crossbow Secret Treasure. A quick probe tightened his brow — the treasure’s power was considerable, enough to wound him, but it came with severe constraints. From Xie Jun’s condition after using it, Yang Kai could infer that the crossbow ravenously consumed the user’s Saint Yuan and even fed upon fresh blood.

It was an evil Secret Treasure.

Yang Kai had no interest in it; to use it once was to subject oneself to slaughter. Such a Secret Treasure was only useful when someone else protected the user, serving as a one-shot assassination tool.

He tossed it carelessly into his Spatial Ring, then picked up the rings belonging to Xie Hongwen and Xie Jun. After a search he felt slightly disappointed.

Aside from pills and Saint Crystals for recovery, there was nothing else in either ring.

That was to be expected: apart from Yang Kai himself, who carried all his valuables, most warriors entering the Flowing Flame Sandland would leave treasures outside rather than risk bringing them in. Any mishap here would be too costly.

Of the pills, the only one that caught Yang Kai’s eye was a vial containing five Ice-Snow Pills.

He had given his own Ice-Snow Pills to Chang Qi and Hao An; there hadn’t been time to refine more after coming in. That he found a few now was not bad — they might be useful someday.

Having seen how meager Xie Hongwen and Xie Jun’s holdings were, Yang Kai lost interest in checking Xie Yong’s Spatial Ring and instead pressed deeper into the Flowing Flame Sandland.

With the Fire Spirit Beast no longer blocking him, Yang Kai used his Wind-and-Thunder Wings to accelerate and left the valley entirely in just over two days.

The farther he went, the more potent the Heat-Flame Zone became. Yang Kai’s constitution was unusual and his Saint Yuan vigorous; having previously trained in a Yang attribute method and now bearing Demonic Flame, he wasn’t overly fearful — a slight circulation of Saint Yuan would stave off the encroaching fire toxin.

How large the Heat-Flame Zone was, he could not tell. He penetrated deeper and encountered not a single figure for a long stretch, and his gains were meager: over fifteen days he obtained a few Seventh-Tier Fire Spirit Beasts’ Crystal Stones and gathered a dozen or so fire-attributed Spiritual Herbs.

Only then did he realize how precious and rare Crystal Stones were. Previously he had been lucky enough to slay an Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast and harvested a pigeon-egg-sized Crystal Stone; later he found a millstone-sized Crystal Stone in the valley — his haul could be said to exceed what most who entered the Flowing Flame Sandland ever obtained.

It was precisely because Seventh-Tier and above Fire Spirit Beasts were so scarce that Crystal Stones were so valuable.

The Crystal Stones from Fifth- and Sixth-Tier Fire Spirit Beasts were too small to be of much use, only suitable for absorption by fighters to aid cultivation.

The dozen or so fire Spiritual Herbs he gathered were mediocre — some Saint King-Grade, some Origin-Grade — not many overall. After all, plants that could grow in the Heat-Flame Zone were few. What pleased Yang Kai was that their medicinal properties were potent; no one had entered here for four hundred years, so they had ample time to mature.

One day while hurrying along, a spark of flame suddenly streaked past him like a grain of fire splashing from the void. It moved at incomprehensible speed; the instant he noticed it, Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense after it, yet still failed to encompass it.

It flickered by and quickly vanished from his sight.

“Flowing Flame Fireblaze?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed — he understood at once what it was.

Wei Guchang had previously told him of the Flowing Flame Fireblaze’s strangeness. Yang Kai had wanted such a blaze to bolster his Divine Sense Fire’s potency, but Wei Guchang had warned that Flowing Flame Fireblazes were astonishingly rare; some who stayed in the Flowing Flame Sandland for half a year might never see one, and others who encountered one might not even be able to perceive it.

Yang Kai hadn’t thought Wei Guchang exaggerated, but now he realized he had underestimated the blaze’s speed.

In an instant he gave chase; the roar of wind and thunder filled the air as he drove his Saint Yuan to the limit and shot forward like lightning.

He wanted to see if he could catch that streak of Flowing Flame Fireblaze.

He soon grew disappointed. After half an hour of pursuit he found the blaze had long since disappeared and could only stop, stand still, and smile wryly.

Such a thing, moving at that speed — who could seize it?

He wondered how the people on Dark Star knew that Flowing Flame Fireblazes could mutate a person’s Divine Sense. If they knew that, someone must have tried it before — which meant someone had obtained a Flowing Flame Fireblaze.

How had they obtained it? Aside from pure chance, there was no other way.

Yang Kai didn’t believe anyone in the Flowing Flame Sandland could be faster than him; if he couldn’t catch a Flowing Flame Fireblaze, no one else could.

After standing gloomily for a while, he took out the Yuan Magnetic Pointer, confirmed his direction, and continued deeper into the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Six days later he paused at a spot and regarded a few clumps of crimson weeds with an odd expression.

He stepped over and touched them; they were indeed extraordinarily tough and sharp as blades.

He had seen similar weeds three days earlier — nearly identical — and had once mistaken them for Spiritual Herbs or Spiritual Medicines. Coming up for a closer look then, he found they were plain weeds with no alchemical value and left them.

Yet their hardness and sharpness surprised him.

He had seen the same specimens three days ago, and now again.

Could he be lost? Yang Kai frowned and took out the Yuan Magnetic Pointer again; he hadn’t actually strayed, for he checked direction at intervals these past days. Getting lost wasn’t so easy.

He smiled wryly, shook his head, and kept walking.

Soon after he returned and left some marks by the strange weeds before moving off again.

Three days later he stood before them with a dark face, extremely displeased.

Only now did he understand that a few days prior it hadn’t been his imagination — he had truly become lost.

The marks he left beside the weeds had not moved; they were the ones he had placed when he left earlier as a precaution.

But how could he have gotten lost? Wei Guchang had said that if one followed the Yuan Magnetic Pointer’s guidance one would inevitably reach the heaven-and-earth treasure zone.

Could the Yuan Magnetic Pointer be broken?

Yang Kai didn’t believe such a Secret Treasure would fail so easily. Why then had he been circling within such a broad area, wasting nine days?

His expression shifted as he stood there thinking.

Suddenly he seemed to recall something. He put a fingertip to his mouth, bit it, and smeared the blood from his fingertip across his left eye.

Golden blood seeped into his left eye, and in an instant his left eye became a blazing gold with a narrow pupil; the color radiated an inexorable majesty that sent chills through the heart.

World-Ending Demon Eye!

Yang Kai scanned the surroundings and immediately detected something amiss: the world seen by his two eyes differed subtly. The right eye perceived the scene as before, but through the left eye the space flowed with faint, almost imperceptible energies; even some hills and mounds appeared unreal and insubstantial.

A formation?

A chill shot through Yang Kai as his heart sank into the valley.

The World-Ending Demon Eye could pierce all illusion. Although the Great Demon God had only cultivated to the Saint King Realm, this eye was an innate divine art beyond what the Saint King Realm alone might imply; its power was not something the Saint King Realm could be compared to.
