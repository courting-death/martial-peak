## Chapter 1484 — Conspiracy

Like Mo Xiaosheng, Qu Zheng was also a peak Third-Stage Origin Returning Realm expert. However, in recent years, he had been in seclusion, comprehending the mysteries of the Void King Realm, and had rarely appeared in public. All the affairs of the Alliance had been left in Mo Xiaosheng’s hands to manage.

On Dark Star, this sort of situation is common.

Because of the restraints of heaven-and-earth’s laws, the limit a martial artist can reach is the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet every expert who attains that level is never content—each wishes to push further and attain the legend of the Void King Realm.

No one has succeeded, but that does not hinder these experts’ determination and steps to explore the Martial and Heavenly Dao.

When the Imperial Garden opened, Qu Zheng went too, though he gained little; the matter he and Mo Xiaosheng were now discussing was related to the Imperial Garden.

At that moment, footsteps suddenly sounded outside the hall, and then a disciple’s voice reported: “Report to the Alliance Master, report to the Great Elder—Sect Master Fang Peng of Leitai Sect requests an audience.”

“Elder Fang?” Qu Zheng’s brow tightened, his displeasure obvious. “That old bastard actually dares to come to my Battle Sky City? He really doesn’t take Qu Zheng seriously, does he?”

Mo Xiaosheng’s face likewise revealed surprise and doubt. The Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect are two of Dark Star’s great powers; though not mortal enemies, they rarely interact and are more often at odds, and countless fights break out among their disciples every year, with many casualties.

Especially when it comes to penetrating the other’s headquarters—this is a grave taboo!

Moreover, Fang Peng’s status is extraordinary—he is the Sect Master of Leitai Sect, a stature equal to Qu Zheng’s.

Given his lofty position and sensitive identity, recklessly coming to Battle Sky City could very well provoke friction or dispute between the two powers and even spark open war, so when the disciple’s report reached him Qu Zheng flared with anger.

“Alliance Master, calm yourself.” Although Mo Xiaosheng was also puzzled, he considered matters far more carefully than Qu Zheng and hurriedly said, “If Elder Fang Peng dares to come to Battle Sky City, perhaps he has some important matter to discuss with the Alliance Master. Let us first see what he intends to do before making any decisions.”

Hearing that, Qu Zheng thought there was some sense in it. As the local lord, he was not afraid of a lone Fang Peng slipping in, so after a short pause he nodded slightly: “Very well, then we'll follow the Great Elder’s counsel. If he truly came to provoke the Battle Sky Alliance… humph. I will let him learn what it means to overestimate himself!”

No sooner had he spoken than loud laughter came from outside the hall, followed by a hearty voice: “Long time no see. Brother Qu’s temper is still as explosive as ever.”

As the voice sounded, a figure appeared at the hall’s entrance. A Battle Sky disciple was taken aback and rushed to block him, only to be kicked aside by the newcomer, who left the man sprawled and groaning; then the intruder strode into the hall with no courtesy at all, treating the place as if it were his own courtyard, relaxed in demeanor.

Qu Zheng’s face darkened; Mo Xiaosheng frowned, displeasure evident.

The visitor was, of course, Sect Master Fang Peng of Leitai Sect—and nobody had expected this fellow’s nerve to be so thick as to enter without invitation.

Once inside the great hall, Fang Peng found a seat of his own and slanted his eyes at Qu Zheng: “Brother Qu, a guest has come from afar—why is there no cup of tea offered? The Battle Sky Alliance wouldn’t be so stingy, would it?”

“Hmph. If it were someone else, I would certainly offer a welcome. But as for you… there’s no need for tea.” Qu Zheng snorted coldly.

Fang Peng curled his lip and did not pursue that trivial matter.

“Old Fang, what are you doing here in my Battle Sky City instead of sitting in Leitai Sect to guard it?” Qu Zheng didn’t bother with pleasantries and got straight to the point. “Cheng Pengxuan has already fallen within the Imperial Garden. Aren’t you afraid someone will seize the chance to cause trouble while you’ve left Leitai Sect unattended?”

“Who would dare?” At mention of Cheng Pengxuan’s fall, Fang Peng’s expression darkened and he snorted coldly. “Though Elder Cheng has unfortunately perished, Leitai Sect is not to be trifled with—who would go seek their own death?”

“Bold words.” Qu Zheng sneered, a dangerous light flickering in his eyes. “If I were to detain you here, I think your Leitai Sect would be little more than a sorry rabble.”

“Detain me?” Fang Peng pointed a finger at himself with a smile. “Brother Qu, spare the boastful talk. If you truly have the confidence, try it—see whether your Battle Sky City can hold Fang.”

The dangerous light in Qu Zheng’s eyes flared ever more fiercely, as if he truly intended to strike.

After all, if Fang Peng were slain here, Leitai Sect would surely collapse, leaving the Battle Sky Alliance the sole dominant power on Dark Star.

Yet Fang Peng’s calm, as if relying on some backing, made Qu Zheng hesitate and unsure, and he could not make up his mind.

Mo Xiaosheng was equally puzzled. Though Fang Peng’s strength was considerable, once inside Battle Sky City he would be trapped and could not leave at will—surely the old man would not be so foolish as to hand himself over.

“Enough of this.” After a tense stand-off, Fang Peng waved a hand. “I’ll speak plainly: I came alone into Battle Sky City because I was ordered to do so.”

“Ordered?” Both Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng were taken aback. “Ordered by whom?”

Fang Peng was the Sect Master of Leitai Sect—who could possibly command him? The two men felt a chill and silently formed suspicions.

“What do you think?” Fang Peng narrowed his eyes at them.

Meeting his gaze, Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng both grew serious. After a long moment Qu Zheng hesitantly said, “Could it be that side?”

“Indeed, precisely that side. Who else could make Fang personally make such a journey?” Fang Peng laughed darkly. “Do you think I came here to die? I am not that old yet—without some backing why would I walk into the tiger’s den?”

Though Fang Peng’s words were unpleasant to hear, Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng exchanged a look and both restrained their killing intent.

Since the other party had come under orders from that side, he couldn’t afford to make a move. Though the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect stood as the two great powers of Dark Star, when compared to that side, they were but minor figures before a true giant.

Several thousand years ago, the Guyang Sect—once equal to the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect—offended that side and was uprooted overnight; that incident revealed how fearsome that force is.

However, that side typically pays no heed to worldly affairs—why would they now send Fang Peng to liaise with the Battle Sky Alliance?

“Brother Fang, speak plainly.” Qu Zheng drew a slow breath and his tone softened. “We both know the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect can dominate Dark Star only because we rely on that side. If it concerns them, our Alliance certainly will not stand idly by.”

“Brother Qu is indeed sensible!” Fang Peng laughed, then grew serious: “The brat from Lingxiao Sect has left Flowing Flame Sandland.”

Qu Zheng was stunned, then quickly realized: “You mean that fellow called Yang Kai?”

“Exactly.” Fang Peng nodded slightly. “Judging from his route, it seems he intends to head toward Yingyue Hall.”

“Yingyue Hall?” Qu Zheng frowned. “What business is that to us?”

“Why pretend ignorance?” Fang Peng sneered. “Lingxiao Sect may not be great, but because it sits within Flowing Flame Sandland no one can attack it. Given time they could grow strong—what room would there be left for you or me on Dark Star?”

“You mean snuff out that danger at its root?”

“Exactly.” Fang Peng nodded soberly. “If he remains hidden in Flowing Flame Sandland, indeed no one can touch him. But since he has the recklessness to come out, his life is no longer entirely his own.”

“That may be so,” Qu Zheng mused, “but I’ve heard this brat’s power is not ordinary—ordinary men can’t take him, and he seems to have many powerful external forces he can call upon.”

“Even so, what of it?” Fang Peng retorted. “Even if he is formidable, he’s only someone who just broke into the Origin Returning Realm. Between our two powers there are countless experts—can’t we still deal with him?”

Qu Zheng nodded slightly, conceding he had perhaps overreacted, though he still wondered how that side factored into this.

“Of course it’s related!” Fang Peng chuckled. “Lingxiao Sect has a Void King-Grade warship—have you not heard?”

“I’ve heard rumors, but is it truly a Void King-Grade warship?” Qu Zheng asked skeptically.

“Ask Elder Mo,” Fang Peng said. “Elder Mo should have seen it with his own eyes.”

Qu Zheng glared at Mo Xiaosheng, who nodded gravely: “Indeed, it is unquestionably a Void King-Grade warship, though I do not know where they acquired it—perhaps it was found in some ruin.”

“No matter where it came from, the crucial point is that if we can obtain this warship, we could leave Dark Star and go to other cultivation stars to achieve the Void King Realm.”

At these words both Mo Xiaosheng and Qu Zheng were struck dumb, their eyes betraying eager expectation.

The Void King Realm is the realm they all dream of but have never touched; yet a Void King-Grade warship could make that dream a possibility.

“Surely you know,” Fang Peng added with a cold laugh, “Ye Xijun also serves as a Great Elder within Lingxiao Sect—do you think that side will simply allow Lingxiao Sect to flourish?”

“I see.” Qu Zheng nodded slightly, finally understanding. Whether for the warship or for Ye Xijun, that side would never permit Lingxiao Sect to grow unchecked; they would seize an opportunity to eradicate them.

And Yang Kai’s departure is precisely such an opportunity.

“Is this something only our two powers must undertake?” Qu Zheng asked.

“For now, yes,” Fang Peng replied, “though that side will also dispatch people.”

“They play clever politics.” Qu Zheng snorted. He could imagine that if Lingxiao Sect were removed, the Void King-Grade warship would fall into that side’s hands, while Leitai Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance would only receive scraps.

“What can you do when another’s fist is bigger?” Qu Zheng smiled wryly. “I’ve transmitted the message. Exactly how we cooperate will require careful discussion—this matter concerns both that warship and Ye Xijun, so it will not suffice to merely kill Yang Kai; he must be captured alive and used as a bargaining chip to force Lingxiao Sect to willingly hand over the warship.”
