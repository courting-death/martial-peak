## Chapter 269 — How Did You Know

Dong Qingyan spoke with such conviction, yet how could Yang Kai believe her?

"Really?" Yang Kai's smile turned even more enigmatic.

"Why would I lie to you?" Dong Qingyan puffed out her chest and patted it, saying, "Rest assured, I guarantee you can get close to the place you want to go!"

"Hehe..." Yang Kai's smile was both lewd and sinister, his eyes fixed intently on Dong Qingyan.

That laugh was both lascivious and evil, causing Dong Qingyan to shiver involuntarily, her skin crawling. She swallowed nervously and said timidly, "You look quite scary when you smile."

Yang Kai's expression turned serious, and he no longer circled around the topic. He asked, "Tell me, how do you know all this?"

"Which part?" Dong Qingyan feigned confusion, her demeanor somewhat unnatural.

"You know where I want to go." Yang Kai squinted at her, raising a finger and shaking it, "Don't tell me this is something your brother told you. Dong Qinghan wouldn't be so indiscreet!"

Before talking to Yang Kai, Dong Qinghan had sent Dong Qingyan away from the Dong Family pharmacy, clearly not wanting her to know Yang Kai's identity. How could he suddenly involve her now?

Moreover, they had only been apart for less than an hour. Just an hour ago, Dong Qinghan was at a loss for what to do; how could he have come up with a solution in such a short time?

Adding to that, with this mischievous cousin's eyes darting around, it would be strange if Yang Kai couldn't see through her.

"It was really my brother who told me," Dong Qingyan insisted firmly.

Yang Kai chuckled sinisterly, grabbing Dong Qingyan's arm and pulling her outside.

"What are you doing... let go of me!" Dong Qingyan protested, refusing to move, her voice filled with panic.

Yang Kai frowned, "If you scream again, I'll knock you out!"

Dong Qingyan quickly shut her mouth but used all her strength to pull back. However, her strength was far inferior to Yang Kai's, and in the blink of an eye, she was dragged to the door.

"What do you want?" Dong Qingyan looked at Yang Kai with a pitiful expression, her face full of pleading.

"I'm taking you back to Dong Qinghan. I believe he hasn't left yet!"

"No, please... I just managed to sneak out! If you send me back, I'll be doomed!" Dong Qingyan exclaimed in horror.

Yang Kai grinned, "Then tell me, how did you know all this?"

"Okay, okay, I'll tell you!" 

Only then did Yang Kai release her.

Dong Qingyan shot Yang Kai a resentful glare. Rubbing her sore wrist from where he had grabbed her, she slowly straightened her disheveled clothes and angrily sat back on the bed.

"Speak! If you dare lie, I really will send you back to your brother," Yang Kai said sternly.

"I overheard it myself." Dong Qingyan cautiously observed Yang Kai's expression. Seeing his face darken, she quickly added, "I’m not lying; I really did overhear it."

Yang Kai smiled. "How did you overhear it? You're only at the peak of the Separation and Union Realm. How could you hide from the Divine Sense of the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians?"

When he was talking to Dong Qinghan, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians had been monitoring the surroundings. If Dong Qingyan had really been eavesdropping, she would definitely not have escaped their scrutiny.

"I have my ways," Dong Qingyan said proudly, sitting on the edge of the bed, swinging her legs back and forth.

Seeing Yang Kai's skeptical expression, Dong Qingyan immediately became displeased: "I am the young lady of the Dong Family; how could I not have a few treasures for self-defense... uh..."

"Treasures?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow in surprise. What kind of treasure could evade the Divine Sense of a Divine Roaming Realm expert? Moreover, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians were already at the late stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, probably around the Eighth Stage. For her to evade them, this treasure must be quite remarkable.

Realizing she had let something slip, Dong Qingyan showed a look of regret, hesitating as she looked at Yang Kai. She whispered, "I can show you, but you mustn't take it from me."

Yang Kai couldn't help but smile wryly, nodding silently. He was quite curious about this so-called treasure.

Seeing his agreement, Dong Qingyan solemnly took out an ancient jade from her bosom.

Yang Kai focused his gaze and saw that the jade was a dark yellow color, seemingly natural. However, there were some intricate patterns within the jade, clearly crafted by someone.

Dong Qingyan infused it with Primordial Qi, and Yang Kai furrowed his brow, discovering that her entire aura had vanished in an instant.

Dong Qingyan said, "You haven't reached the Divine Roaming Realm yet, and without Divine Sense, you won't be able to appreciate the wonders of this treasure. But I truly am not lying. It was with this that I evaded those two old men."

As she spoke, Yang Kai had already released his Divine Sense to probe around her, and indeed, as she said, there was no anomaly where she was. If he had his eyes closed, he wouldn't have sensed anyone else in the room.

This treasure was quite interesting!

"Put it away. Make sure you never expose this thing in front of strangers again," Yang Kai warned seriously.

Dong Qingyan giggled, "Wealth shouldn't be flaunted; I'm not an idiot!"

While speaking, she put the ancient jade away.

"How much did you hear?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

"Almost... everything," Dong Qingyan stuck out her tongue.

"And how much do you know?"

"I know you want to go to that place, and I also know... you really are my cousin..." Dong Qingyan said, somewhat speechless. She had just casually called him that, and it turned out to be accurate.

"You said you have a way to get me close to there. Is that true?"

"Of course it's true," Dong Qingyan nodded repeatedly, her eyes twinkling. "But I'm not going to tell you the method right now."

Yang Kai immediately laughed, "Conditions? Just state your conditions!"

"Don't let my brother catch me!" Dong Qingyan quickly said.

Yang Kai frowned. He had already noticed that this girl had sneaked out. Dong Qinghan would likely show up at Yao Wang Valley, probably chasing after her. Although he had some familial ties to the Dong Family, this was ultimately their family matter; he couldn't take charge.

Not long ago, she had been pursued by a group of villains. If something were to happen to her, the Dong Family would definitely not let it go easily.

"Cousin..." Dong Qingyan saw him pondering and put on a pitiful look, shaking Yang Kai's arm, "I’m dying of boredom at home. I just wanted to come out for a stroll. I’ll go back after a few days. Please don’t inform them, okay?"

Yang Kai remained silent.

Dong Qingyan pleaded repeatedly, and finally, in a fit of desperation, she said, "If you don’t protect me, I’ll... I’ll announce to the world that you are the young master of the Yang Family. Let’s see who will have a hard time then."

Yang Kai couldn't help but rub his forehead, feeling a headache coming on.

If someone else had threatened him like this, he would have killed them without hesitation, but he couldn't do that to her.

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai said, "I will definitely inform Dong Qinghan about your whereabouts."

Dong Qingyan immediately jumped up, cursing, "Heartless! Stinky cousin. I hate you!"

"Let me finish!" Yang Kai glared at her, "But I can also protect you, provided you don’t cause me any trouble."

"Okay, okay!" Dong Qingyan nodded like a chick pecking at rice. "I promise to behave!"

With a helpless shake of his head, Yang Kai could only write a letter.

At the Dong Family pharmacy, Dong Qinghan was furious: "Miss is missing? How could she be missing? Are you all raised by dogs? So many eyes watching, and you let her disappear in the blink of an eye?"

The few disciples of the Dong Family in front of him were drenched in sweat, silenced and on the verge of tears.

There was simply nothing they could do. They didn’t have much strength, and the flow of people in Yao Wang Valley was incessant. The young lady was also quite clever; once she mixed into the crowd, she vanished without a trace. What could they do?

Though they thought this, they didn’t dare to speak up.

"What are you all standing around for? You idiots! Hurry up and find her! If you can’t find the young lady, don’t bother coming back. Just find a place to chop yourselves up and feed the dogs, useless bunch!" Dong Qinghan's face was ashen.

The group scattered like birds and beasts, muttering to themselves, "Oh dear, young lady, please come back quickly. If you don’t return, we might lose our lives."

"Young master, weapons are strictly prohibited in Yao Wang Valley. The young lady should be safe; don’t worry. She might come back soon," one of the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians comforted.

"I'm just afraid she ran away," Dong Qinghan said helplessly. "This girl doesn’t know the heights of heaven and earth. She just got into big trouble a few days ago, and she still hasn’t learned her lesson!"

He looked at her with a mix of disappointment and frustration.

The two guardians exchanged glances and said no more.

Just as he was fuming, a servant came in, bowing and scraping as he asked, "Which one is the young master of the Dong Family?"

"I am!" Dong Qinghan replied in a deep voice.

"Young master Dong, hello." The servant smiled obsequiously, "A guest asked me to deliver a message to you."

Dong Qinghan's expression changed: "Where?"

The servant quickly presented the letter.

In a hurry, Dong Qinghan tore it open and skimmed through it, finally feeling a huge weight lift from his heart.

Meanwhile, one of the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians had given the servant some silver and sent him away. Seeing their young master’s furrowed brows relax, he couldn’t help but ask, "Do you have news of the young lady?"

Dong Qinghan rubbed his forehead, taking a deep breath, and said softly, "Yes, she went to Yang Kai."

"Since she is with Young Master Yang, there’s no need to worry."

At the inn, Yang Kai had opened another room for Dong Qingyan, right next door. Such thoughtful arrangements made the young lady of the Dong Family feel a surge of gratitude towards Yang Kai: "Cousin, you’re so nice!"

The next day, Dong Qinghan came to visit. Yang Kai briefly recounted the events, and Dong Qinghan could only smile wryly. With Dong Qingyan's threats, he didn’t dare to force the issue; if Yang Kai's identity were exposed, it would not be a trivial matter.

In the end, he could only comply with his sister’s wishes.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, seven or eight days had passed.

During this time, Yang Kai spent most of his time in cultivation. Although there were many martial artists in Yao Wang Valley, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth remained abundant, making it a good place for cultivation.

From time to time, Dong Qingyan would drag him out for some fun. After spending these days together, Yang Kai was surprised to discover that his cousin was actually an alchemist, albeit at a low level, merely a Common-Grade Middle-Level alchemist, just starting out.

As the young lady of the Dong Family, she had grown up without worries, and her family had invested significant resources in her training. She could simply take any pills she wanted from the family, so there was no need for her to refine pills herself. Thus, even though she showed a strong interest in alchemy, she lacked practical experience.

Arriving at Yao Wang Valley felt like stepping into paradise for her; everything here captivated her.
