## Chapter 1314 — Qian Yue's Encounter

The Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, which Yang Kai had disturbed with his aura, returned to its natural flow in that instant.

"Why would you give up this opportunity?" Qian Yue asked, a trace of something like surprise and regret flashing through her eyes.

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. "No matter, it will come again. Right now I'm more curious about what happened to you after entering the Star Domain, and how you were separated."

Qian Yue let out a bitter laugh, but still nodded. "Very well. You're so concerned—this is not the best time for a breakthrough."

She then told, in a steady voice, what had befallen the Ice Sect party after they entered the Star Domain.

From her description Yang Kai learned their ordeal had been considerably more perilous than his own; the starry-sky storms were one thing, and the Meteorite Sea another—both deadly.

Their bodies and divine sense cultivation were, after all, not on par with Yang Kai's, so once inside the Star Domain they could not easily repel the present dangers. Had Qing Ya and the others not defended with all their strength, Su Yan would have long since fallen.

Even so, two elders of the Ice Sect at the Saint Realm were swept away in a starry-sky storm and failed to escape, perishing; in the end only Ice Lord Qing Ya, Su Yan, Qian Yue and Senior Brother Qian Hao remained.

The remaining four wandered through the Star Domain for years, and just when their hope had drained, they suddenly discovered a Void Passage.

They did not know where that Void Passage in the starry sky led, nor what dangers lay ahead, but if they abandoned that chance they had no way to continue.

After discussion the four rushed into the Void Passage, but it was unstable and branched into many forks; the group became separated within it. When Qian Yue emerged from the Passage she found herself on Dark Star.

As for the others, she could not say where they had gone.

Yang Kai's expression darkened considerably at this.

If they had parted after following the same fork then Ice Lord Qing Ya, Elder Qian Hao and Su Yan would surely have arrived at Dark Star too, but they had taken different branches inside the Void Passage—who could know to what places those paths sent the remaining three?

Moreover, Yang Kai judged there was about a ninety percent chance the other three were not on Dark Star, because a faint, instinctive resonance still connected him to Su Yan, and that bond had grown stronger as his strength increased.

Once he had even sent a drop of Golden Blood to circle Dark Star; if Su Yan truly were there he would have sensed it.

That the Void Passage itself could produce forks puzzled Yang Kai, but the world is full of wonders. He was only a minor figure at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, and many things remained beyond his understanding.

The presence of the Ice Soul Pearl proved the three were still alive; it was only that they were somewhere in the Star Domain beyond his reach.

When Qian Yue arrived on Dark Star she appeared near Black Crow City, having passed through the Void Passage with barely a tenth of her strength left. Frail and weak, she unfortunately met several wicked cultivators who, seeing her beauty, harbored ill intent. Fortunately an Origin Returning Realm expert passing by rescued her and brought her back to Hehuan House.

From then on Qian Yue lived in Hehuan House and cultivated the Dual Cultivation Technique given to her by her savior.

As time passed Qian Yue gradually understood what went on here and what fate awaited her. Fortunately her cultivation was not low—she had reached the First Stage of the Saint King Realm—so she was not open to anyone. Occasionally a wealthy patron came but did not choose her, and so she remained free until now.

Today she heard a noble guest would arrive—the day she was to be presented—and Qian Yue's heart was anxious, never expecting the arriving guest to be Yang Kai.

As Qian Yue related these events, Yang Kai remained silent, listening quietly.

Seeming to hold back a well of bitterness, Qian Yue dabbed at her tears as she spoke. It was no surprise—once she had been an elder of the Ice Sect, a figure of some standing on Tongxuan Continent, but after entering the Star Domain she had scarcely seen its wonders before narrowly escaping death time and again; once settled, she was confined and reduced to a life as a courtesan.

The contrast between then and now was almost unbearable.

Yang Kai did not know how to comfort her. Qian Yue was technically his senior, and though a seasoned cultivator can preserve youth, one cannot comfort her like a peer without overstepping.

After she had calmed her emotions, Yang Kai asked, “If you were to see the place where you were separated again, would you still recognize it?”

“I can’t be completely certain, but I still remember some of the nearby stars,” Qian Yue replied with a faint nod.

"Good," Yang Kai brightened. "When we have time, tell me the distinguishing marks of those stars."

"That is no problem, but how will you confirm a position from those alone?" she asked.

"You needn't worry; I have my methods. By the way, you said someone placed restrictions on you—if it's convenient, may I take a look?"

"You may, but do not act rashly. The one who placed the restriction is the Origin Returning Realm expert who saved me and is one of Hehuan House's masters. She meditates in a private chamber; if disturbed it will bring trouble."

"I know." Yang Kai inclined his head. When Qian Yue extended her hand he touched her wrist with two fingers; Saint Yuan flowed like a thin current, running through her body.

As he probed, Yang Kai's expression grew increasingly solemn.

After a long while he withdrew his fingers, wearing a thoughtful look. "Not an especially vicious restriction. It seems that person only wished to prevent you from running."

"Yes. I tried to run several times, but whenever she triggered the restriction I would be drained and could not get far. And if I had not been in the midst of breaking into the Saint King Realm a few years back, she would not have tolerated my audacity."

Years before Qian Yue had been only at the Saint Realm, and the price Hehuan House could obtain for a Saint Realm woman and a Saint King Realm woman differed greatly; even if she attempted to flee, that woman merely punished her lightly and did not truly mean to ruin her.

When Qian Yue successfully broke into the Saint King Realm, the woman eagerly presented her as a candidate for patrons seeking Dual Cultivation.

In retrospect, the savior's actions were likely calculated—Qian Yue was alone, cultivated, and unblemished; rescuing and presenting her was far more cost-effective than training one from scratch.

"I've told you my story. What of you? How is Tongxuan Continent? Has the Bone Race run rampant?" Qian Yue smoothed her appearance and asked anxiously.

Though she had come to the Star Domain, Tongxuan Continent remained her home and she could not help worrying about it.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Do not worry about the Bone Race—they have been annihilated. When I left Tongxuan Continent it prospered; the demons, yao and humans, united against a common foe, have grown far more harmonious."

"The Bone Race was annihilated?" Qian Yue exclaimed in surprise. "How was that accomplished?"

Yang Kai briefly recounted how the three races of Tongxuan Continent joined to oppose the Bone Race, and Qian Yue listened, enraptured and smiling; at her urging Yang Kai also related a portion of what had befallen him deeper within the Star Domain.

Compared to Qian Yue's fate, Yang Kai's path had been far more spectacular and equally perilous.

The moment he entered the Star Domain he was seized and confined in a warship's power chamber to have Saint Yuan drawn from him to replenish the vessel—nearly drained to death; he encountered accidents in the Chaos Abyss where the ship was destroyed and he drifted to a Floating Continent, fell under the control of the Ghost Ancestor, barely escaped that Floating Continent, traveled to Shuiyue Star, inexplicably made an enemy of Third Young Master Xue Yue of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, and on the way to Rainfall Star endured near-death after near-death.

He broke the Soul Chain and escaped Rainfall Star, slept for many years, was protected by a blood-red crystal that carried him near Dark Star, and by chance met Wu Yi of the Haike Family and the others, who saved him.

He told of these things until the recent opening of the Flowing Flame Sandland, at which point he paused.

Naturally, Yang Kai instinctively glossed over the licentious duel with Third Young Master Xue Yue on Dead Star, and in his telling Xue Yue was merely a man.

After hearing him, Qian Yue was full of envy and admiration—envy for his freedom and lack of restraint, admiration for how he had braved so many dangers. That his original purpose in entering the Star Domain was to seek Su Yan comforted Qian Yue; she felt she had not entrusted her life to the wrong person.

From his concern for Su Yan, even after so many years her place in his heart remained undiminished.

After a pause Qian Yue suddenly smiled slyly and looked at Yang Kai. "You seem to be living quite well, to have the leisure and interest to come to a place like this."

Yang Kai was taken aback and immediately realized she was speaking up for Su Yan. He hastily waved his hand. "Elder Qian Yue, you misunderstand—I have reasons for coming."

"Of course you do—every man who comes here says so. But in light of your earlier behavior I'll let Su Yan give you a chance to explain. If there's truly other business, fine; if not, hum—do not blame me if I speak ill of you next time I meet Su Yan," Qian Yue said with a half-teasing, half-warning smile.

Yang Kai felt as if his head had swelled, but quickly relaxed and candidly told how Shen Fanlei had invited him and in the telling revealed his suspicions about Wang Yuhan.
