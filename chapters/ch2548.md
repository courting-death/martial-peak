## Chapter 2548 — What Is This

Two days later, the strange mist around them suddenly thinned a bit. Yang Kai wasn’t sure if it was just his imagination.

Old Ban, who was walking ahead, suddenly stopped and said, “Young man, we’re almost at the exit. The mist here doesn’t suppress Divine Sense as much. With your strength, you should be able to find a safe path.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai quickly released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings. Sure enough, just as Old Ban said, the mist here suppressed Divine Sense much less than before, and the range he could investigate had expanded.

As long as his Divine Sense could reach further, he would never get lost in this strange mist.

And the further he walked, the less the strange mist suppressed him, making each step safer than the last.

“Thank you for everything along the way, Old Ban. Be careful on your way back,” Yang Kai said with a cupped fist.

Old Ban smiled slightly and said, “No need to worry about me, Young Master. But if you need me again when you return, you can wait in that cave over there.” He pointed in a direction and continued, “I wait there one day every month to take people out of the Ancient Land passage, but the timing isn’t fixed.”

Yang Kai understood and smiled, “Old Ban runs a two-way business.”

If someone wanted to enter the Ancient Land passage, he could lead them in from Desolate City, and when leaving, he could take people out. It was indeed a good business.

Old Ban chuckled, “I’m just a weak old man. I know the terrain well enough, but if I run into powerful Yin-Souls, there’s nothing I can do. Escorting a few people out is a good way to look after myself, too.”

“Old Ban thinks things through,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Alright, I’ll take my leave now. Young Master, Young Lady, safe travels. Come back soon,” Old Ban said, then walked off in the direction he’d pointed, likely to wait for people to escort out.

Once Old Ban’s figure disappeared, Yang Kai turned his gaze forward. After a moment, he said, “Ruoxi. I’ll walk the rest of the way alone.”

Zhang Ruoxi’s face showed a trace of distress. She wanted to help Yang Kai, but her strength was lacking. If she stayed, she might become a burden. She could only grit her teeth and agree.

Light flashed, and Yang Kai put Zhang Ruoxi into the Xuan Realm Pearl before striding forward.

The further he walked, the less the mist affected him, and the wider his Divine Sense could reach.

Just as he was about to leave the Ancient Land passage and step into the true wilderness, Yang Kai suddenly halted. He glanced around, surveying his surroundings with a cautious gaze.

Here, the mist was so thin it barely affected him, so he could see everything around him clearly.

All was silent, with no sign of life, not even the slightest fluctuation of Spiritual Qi.

Yet Yang Kai grinned and said, “Brother Yin. You’ve waited many days for this moment. Now that I’m here, why keep hiding?”

As he spoke, a patch of sky seemed to tear like silk, suddenly revealing a group of more than twenty people.

A fierce killing intent erupted instantly, and pairs of eyes stared at Yang Kai like hungry tigers.

At that moment, a streak of light flashed through the air and transformed into a cloak-shaped Secret Treasure, landing in the hands of a red-clothed girl.

Yang Kai’s gaze lingered on the cloak for a while. He raised his eyebrows, “Concealment Secret Treasure.”

Earlier, his Divine Sense hadn’t detected anyone here, but his intuition told him Netherworld Sect’s people were definitely lying in ambush. He tested with words, and sure enough, it was so.

It seemed it wasn’t Netherworld Sect’s concealment technique that was so clever, but the cloak’s merit.

Who knows who refined this thing—it could hide so many people at once, and even Yang Kai hadn’t noticed. Truly marvelous.

“You’re here too?” Yang Kai looked at the red-clothed girl, a little surprised.

Although Yang Kai already knew the red-clothed girl and Elder Fu had entered the Ancient Land passage a day ahead of him, he hadn’t expected them to be mixed up with the Netherworld Sect. He couldn’t tell if they were actually members of Netherworld Sect or just working together for now.

Now, the red-clothed girl glared at him fiercely, as if she wanted to eat him, and snapped, “How did you find us?”

Elder Fu couldn’t help but rub his forehead and said, “Miss, he most likely didn’t find us. That treasure, the Shadowless Cloak, was personally bestowed upon you by the Lord. How could a mere First Stage Emperor possibly see through its mysteries?”

The red-clothed girl was stunned, “Didn’t find us? How is that possible? He clearly said those things.”

Elder Fu was left speechless.

Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen were also speechless, thinking that Yang Kai had just bluffed, and she’d lifted the Secret Treasure’s concealment herself. Now she was asking how he found them—how could she be so foolish?

They’d hoped to use the girl’s Imperial Treasure to catch Yang Kai off guard, and only needed him to walk ten zhang further. Who knew their ambush would be ruined, their lineup exposed with no chance for a sneak attack.

For a moment, Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen’s faces were as black as the bottom of a pot.

If they’d known, they wouldn’t have relied on the girl’s power—they’d have hidden themselves instead.

“Are you two also from Netherworld Sect?” Yang Kai asked the red-clothed girl and Elder Fu.

Before Elder Fu could answer, the red-clothed girl spoke first, snorting, “Netherworld Sect? As if! I’d never come from a place like that.”

At these words, Elder Fu’s face changed, and Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng looked even more displeased.

The girl spoke without restraint, and saying this in front of Netherworld Sect’s people was a slap in the face. Netherworld Sect was a top sect in the Eastern Territory, a famous name, but in her mouth, it was nothing.

What is this?

Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng’s faces couldn’t look any worse.

If anyone else had said this, Hua Feichen would’ve slapped them, but with this girl, he didn’t dare touch a hair on her head.

Elder Fu hurriedly laughed, “Elder Hua, don’t mind her. My lady is always like this, no offense meant.”

Though Hua Feichen was annoyed, he couldn’t show it. He just said coldly, “No matter. Miss Lin’er is straightforward. This Lord naturally won’t take it to heart.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with understanding, and he nodded, “I see.”

Lin’er snapped, “See what?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Nothing. You and the Netherworld Sect are working together—are you here to make things difficult for me?”

Lin’er gritted her teeth, “So what if I am?” Seeing Yang Kai standing still, she thought he was scared, and said smugly, “If you want to live, crawl over and kowtow to me a few times, then offer your soul mark and be my slave for ten years. Maybe if I’m in a good mood, I’ll spare your life.”

“No!” Yin Lesheng’s face changed dramatically and he quickly stopped her.

He’d brought so many people to kill Yang Kai, and now the girl was talking about possibly sparing him—how could today’s matter end peacefully?

No matter what, Yang Kai had to die today.

Before he could say more, Lin’er turned and shouted angrily, “Shut up! When I’m talking, it’s not your turn to interrupt!”

Yin Lesheng was so angry his face twisted, but he didn’t dare say a word.

He was furious. Clearly, the girl wanted to use them to get revenge, but now it seemed they’d become her subordinates, forced to obey her orders.

What is this supposed to be?

Lin’er turned to Yang Kai, looking him up and down, and frowned, “Where’s that damned girl? Where did she go?”

She’d been so angry at seeing Yang Kai that she’d forgotten about Zhang Ruoxi. Now she realized Yang Kai was alone, and Zhang Ruoxi was nowhere to be seen.

Yang Kai smiled silently.

Lin’er shouted, “Are you deaf? I’m asking you! Where did that damned girl go? She dared slap my face—I want her to wish she was dead!”

“Slap…” Hua Feichen perked up his ears, looking at Lin’er in astonishment.

The other Netherworld Sect disciples also looked shocked, as if they’d seen a ghost.

In this world… someone actually dared slap this Young Lady’s face? Who was this bold girl?

Elder Fu stood aside, cold sweat pouring down his forehead, his legs trembling.

With him as her guard, the Young Lady had been slapped. If no one mentioned it, it could be forgotten, but she’d announced it in public. If word reached the Lord, how could he survive?

Elder Fu was terrified and quickly looked at Hua Feichen, pleading with his eyes not to spread the story.

Hua Feichen understood and just smiled, nodding lightly in response.

Although Elder Fu’s cultivation wasn’t as high as his, he hailed from that place and had long served as the Young Lady’s protector. Building a good relationship with him could only be beneficial.

Maybe he’d need Elder Fu’s help someday. Doing him a favor now would pay off later.

Elder Fu got the message and quickly cupped his fists in gratitude.

Lin’er ranted for a while, her chest heaving, then put her hands on her hips and said angrily, “Hurry up and bring that damned girl out! I won’t let her off no matter what.”

She naturally thought Yang Kai had hidden Zhang Ruoxi somewhere.

Yang Kai snorted, looking at her calmly, “Little girl, let me give you some advice. This is not a place to linger. Otherwise, you won’t even know how you died.”

“How dare you!” Elder Fu shouted in anger. Yang Kai actually dared threaten his lady—unforgivable.

Lin’er was stunned for a moment before she reacted, frowning, “You want to kill me?”

Yang Kai replied coldly, “Three warnings are enough. If you refuse to listen, what’s stopping me from killing you?”

Lin’er went hysterical, “You actually want to kill me? You’ve got some nerve! Quick, quick, quick, get him! Grab him for me!” She shouted while shoving Yin Lesheng and the others, acting as if Netherworld Sect’s people were really her subordinates.
