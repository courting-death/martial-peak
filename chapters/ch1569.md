## Chapter 1569 — Are You Out of Your Mind?

It was already too late. Yang Kai shot forward like a flying arrow, sprinted to the second Thunderflame Flying Lizard, twisted his body, and plunged straight into its gaping maw.

In the next instant, a terrifying sound erupted from within the Thunderflame Flying Lizard’s body—so dreadful it made one’s scalp tingle. Visible to the naked eye, ring after ring of explosive energy ripples spread down from its neck, finally vanishing at its abdomen.

Boom...

A huge hole burst open in the Thunderflame Flying Lizard's belly, and Yang Kai shot out from within.

The second Thunderflame Flying Lizard collapsed with a thunderous crash, its life force gone.

Everything occurred in the blink of an eye — from the moment Mi Tian ordered Yang Kai slain to the instant Yang Kai struck back and killed two Thunderflame Flying Lizards, no more than three breaths had passed.

The turn of events was so swift that those watching could scarcely follow with their minds.

Only when Yang Kai burst from the belly of the second Thunderflame Flying Lizard did they finally jolt back to their senses.

Two mighty Ninth-Tier demonic beasts... had just died like that.

Is that still a Thunderflame Flying Lizard? Could those be weak demonic beasts that merely resembled Thunderflame Flying Lizards? Such thoughts sprang to everyone's minds as they stared at Yang Kai, stunned and bewildered.

That frenzied, brutal fighting style left everyone dazed and spellbound, yet filled with fear.

The yao are famed for their rough, violent combat, and they have long taken pride in it.

They believe their clan's way of fighting is true battle; as for humans... they are far too flashy and ornamental.

Yet the human who had collided with Young Master Mi Tian now demonstrated, in a way that seared both mind and sight, what true wildness and ferocity really meant!

The entire scene fell silent.

Even Mi Tian looked at Yang Kai with a grave expression.

He had finally realized: this human... seemed not to be someone to be trifled with.

The two Thunderflame Flying Lizards used to pull his cart had been tamed since youth and had lost some wildness; they could not compare to wild-born kin, yet they were not something a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could slay so casually.

Before him, his own cart-pulling demonic beasts had no strength to resist and had died together.

Mi Tian told himself he could not have done this! He suspiciously sent out his divine sense to probe Yang Kai and found that the human truly was at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and had nothing hidden.

Mi Tian narrowed his eyes; an extremely eerie light flickered in his pupils. For some inexplicable reason, the blood within him suddenly began to boil.

The yao are bellicose by nature. Though Young Master Mi Tian is the young son of the Thousand-Eyed Lord and holds high station, the bloodthirst and madness in his bones have not been abated by his status; they surpass those of many of his kin.

He thought Yang Kai must be a worthy opponent! Perhaps he could let loose and have a proper fight.

Crack, crack...

A faint, peculiar sound. Suddenly an almost imperceptible tremor ran through every part of Mi Tian's body; each limb twitched with a subtle oscillation.

It was a sign of excitement!

"What's happening!" At that moment, several streaks of light flew in from afar; before the riders arrived, a shout of anger rang out.

The lights descended and, upon seeing the demonic beast corpses before the city gate and the tense atmosphere, the newcomers were momentarily stunned.

"Lord Magna!" The yao warrior who had earlier ridden the wolf-type demonic beast hurried to them and saluted with respect.

The lord of Huiyue City was the yao expert Magna. As a city lord, he naturally cultivated to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Yet although he was lord of Huiyue City, he knew nothing of what had happened here and had not even been informed of Mi Tian's arrival.

It was not that Magna was out of touch; rather Mi Tian had acted so irregularly. The squad of wolf-riding yao warriors had only been tasked to scout Mi Tian's movements and report back so the palace could send men to welcome him and lead him to the palace.

No one expected that Mi Tian had not allowed those yao to send word; after meeting them he had coerced them and forced them to bring him directly to Huiyue City.

He clearly knew his reputation was poor and that he was unwelcome; to prevent news leaking and the city's residents from preparing by hiding the beauties, he simply did not notify the lord of Huiyue City.

He had come straight here, planning first to hunt for amusement before going to Lady Chi Yue's palace.

The idea sounded grand, but upon entering the city he had already been provoked by Yang Kai, and even his two Ninth-Tier cart-pulling demonic beasts had been slain.

"Young Master Mi Tian?" Magna recognized Mi Tian at a glance; his face darkened—he truly did not welcome this Mi Tian stirring trouble in his city.

"Heh heh, Young Master Mi Tian greets Lord Magna. Mi Tian came uninvited; please do not take offense," Mi Tian smiled, clasping his hands in salute—urbane, dazzling, and still capable of making countless women swoon.

"What is the meaning of this?" Magna asked sternly, looking at the yao warrior mounted on the wolf-type demonic beast.

The yao warrior was sweating coldly; knowing the lord was displeased, he dared not hide anything and hurriedly recounted all that had occurred.

"Impudence!" When Magna learned that Yang Kai had slain Mi Tian's cart-pulling demonic beasts, he suddenly barked, his sharp gaze fixed on Yang Kai.

Though he disliked Mi Tian's meddling in his territory, a human daring to assault a noble of the yao was intolerable; compared to Mi Tian's uninvited conduct, his anger toward this human was far greater.

Yet who was this human, able to kill two Ninth-Tier demonic beasts in so short a time? His strength was not ordinary.

He looked Yang Kai over skeptically, unable to recall any human who could possess such talent.

Yang Kai ignored him, calmly drew in a moment, then flicked his hand; two Golden Blood Threads shot forth from the dead Thunderflame Flying Lizard corpses, twining around his fingertips like things with a will of their own.

Gazing at the two Golden Blood Threads—gold and red intertwined—Yang Kai smiled with satisfaction.

He had been looking for suitable Demonic Beasts to refine into his Blood Beast Secret Art, but unexpectedly found two ready-made ones here. That was why, after clashing with Mi Tian, he had acted without the slightest hesitation.

A Blood Beast Secret Art refined from the spirit essences and blood vitality of two Ninth-Tier Demonic Beasts was quite a fine result.

After he retracted the Golden Blood Threads, the Thunderflame Flying Lizard bodies on the ground suddenly withered like deflated skins, as if all their essence had been drawn out in an instant.

"Eh!" Mi Tian's eyes brightened. "What secret art is this!"

He seemed genuinely intrigued, fixed on the two Golden Blood Threads between Yang Kai's fingers with astonished eyes.

Although a high-ranking yao lord, Mi Tian had an abiding interest in human secret arts; humans could not match yao in bodily strength, but in creating secret arts they were unrivaled.

Each race possessed its own advantages.

Mi Tian knew this well, and unlike many yao experts he did not despise human techniques as mere showy tricks; he was willing to study and comprehend them.

With the yao's formidable bodies paired with humanity's ever-changing, inscrutable secret arts, Mi Tian believed he could one day found a school even more far-reaching than his father the Thousand-Eyed Lord, stand at the apex of Yao Star Di Chen, and become the chief of the Ten Lords!

That post had long hung vacant.

Now he was very interested in Yang Kai's Golden Blood Threads secret art.

He had studied many human secret arts and had a sharp eye; at once he could see the extraordinary nature of the Golden Blood Threads, and once they had shot from the Thunderflame Flying Lizard bodies they seemed to possess a spirit!

"Give them to me!" The domineering thought flashed through Mi Tian; he pointed at Yang Kai and said, "Human, hand over what is in your hand to me and I will let bygones be bygones for what happened earlier."

Yang Kai glanced up, curled his lips in a smile, and with a thought the Golden Blood Threads coiling at his fingertips disappeared; succinctly he said, "No."

Mi Tian frowned, giving him a strange look before chuckling. “Human, is your head not screwed on right? Do you really think that killing this Young Master’s two beast mounts means the matter ends here? You think you can still leave Huiyue City alive? If you want to live, behave yourself and cooperate with me. I can let you off—but don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!”

As he spoke, Huiyue City's lord Magna and several Origin Returning Realm experts beside him glowered at Yang Kai, ready at any moment to leap forward and teach him a harsh lesson.

Regarding Yang Kai, Magna unconditionally stood with Mi Tian.

He gave Yang Kai a hostile look and said coldly, "Boy, do not be ungrateful. In my Huiyue City, we will not tolerate your insolence."

"Insolent?" Yang Kai slanted his eyes at him, arrogance and defiance radiating from his every pore, offering him no face. Threateningly he said, "So what if I'm insolent? Are you going to bite me?"

"Brazen!" Magna flew into a rage. In all his years he had never seen such a contemptuous human; across Di Chen Star, which human would be so reckless? Even the mightiest humans would show deference to the yao, let alone to a city lord!

He glanced at Mi Tian, who happened to be looking their way.

Their gazes met and each read the other's mind.

They would join forces to kill or capture this human—otherwise the yao would have no face left.

But before they could move, an exceedingly strange energy fluctuation suddenly came from somewhere in Huiyue City; both Mi Tian and Magna, being Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts, detected it immediately.

What puzzled them was that they could not determine what had triggered the energy fluctuation.

Yang Kai's expression sharpened; he looked toward the source of the fluctuation, frowned in thought, and then as if recalling something, his figure flashed off in that direction.

His speed was astonishingly fast!
