## Chapter 1030 — Do You Want to Follow This Old Man

In the Chaos Abyss, Shen Tu and Bi Ya anxiously peered into the gaping rift in space, hoping to catch sight of Yang Kai.

But they couldn't see what was inside at all; the rift, scorched by demonic flames, had already begun to close, and there was still no sign of anyone escaping.

It seemed as if Yang Kai and the others were to be left there forever!

“He won’t run into any trouble, will he?” Shen Tu muttered under his breath. “Brother Yang’s grasp of the mysteries of space is already at a very high level—he shouldn’t have any problems, right? What do you think?”

He turned to look at Bi Ya, hoping she would affirm his words.

“I don't know……” Bi Ya shook her head, her emotions tangled, “but I hope he doesn't get hurt!”

If Yang Kai never returned and was swallowed by the spatial rift, then the Soul Imprint he held over her would vanish with him — and once that imprint disappeared, she would undoubtedly die!

Naturally, she did not wish anything to happen to Yang Kai.

“He's out!” Shen Tu suddenly barked and rushed forward. He saw a figure flicker within the nearly closed rift and burst forth.

It was the Ghost Ancestor!

Seeing his face clearly, Shen Tu complained angrily, “Why is it you? Where's Brother Yang?”

“Behind me!” the Ghost Ancestor turned and looked back. Following close behind him were the sisters He Zao and He Miao, freed from the rift, and then Yang Kai and Yue Xi.

No sooner had Yang Kai stepped out than the rift, scorched by demon flames, snapped shut behind him and vanished without a trace.

“Ha ha, I knew Brother Yang was blessed with great fortune and wouldn't be harmed.” Shen Tu laughed heartily, sincerely glad for Yang Kai, but then his expression shifted oddly. He scrutinized him with keen interest and let out a soft chuckle, as if he'd discovered something, an ambiguous look on his face.

Everyone else's gazes gathered as well, their expressions turning strange.

At that moment Yang Kai had his arm around Yue Xi's waist. Yue Xi showed no resistance, her neck flushed, an unnatural look on her fair face.

He Miao instinctively covered her mouth, her beautiful eyes wide, staring at this inexplicable scene, wondering what had happened between her master and Yang Kai after she and her sister escaped that made them suddenly so intimate.

What shocked her most was that her master showed no sign of resistance.

She had never allowed any man within three zhang of her—let alone be held in someone’s arms. This was truly a first in her life. If the people of the Sword Alliance, or those admirers of her Master among the stars, were to learn of this scene, they would undoubtedly risk their lives to kill Yang Kai.

He Zao couldn't help but cough softly, at a loss as to how to remind her master.

Under all those staring eyes, Yue Xi's expression grew even more unnatural; she wished she could crawl back into that rift and never come out.

Yang Kai, however, said nothing. He unobtrusively loosened his hold, then his figure flickered as he suddenly retreated a hundred zhang, coldly and warily staring at the Ghost Ancestor. His power lay hidden, ready to rend space and flee at any moment.

The ambiguous atmosphere was instantly shattered; everyone's faces turned grave, and they all looked toward the Ghost Ancestor as if facing a great enemy.

They had now left the Floating Continent and reached the Chaos Abyss, and the Ghost Ancestor had fulfilled his two-thousand-year-old desire. If he chose to attack them now, apart from Yang Kai who might have a sliver of hope, none of the others would stand a chance.

The vast Star Domain lay studded with stars, silent. Yet the air surrounding them was heavy and tense.

The Ghost Ancestor smiled lightly, his eerie eyes fixed on Yang Kai a hundred zhang away; inscrutable, no one knew what he was thinking.

Strong heartbeats sounded from everyone’s chests, powerful and rapid like drumbeats.

“Boy, what are you afraid of?” the Ghost Ancestor asked.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched as he answered plainly, “Afraid that you won't keep your word, that you'll go back on it!”

“Am I so untrustworthy?” the Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly. “For even saying that I could make you die a dozen times! Don't think that because you can tear open space you can escape this old master's palm. You're too weak; I can stop you before you even try!”

“I believe you have the strength, but if you truly attack I won't sit idly by!” Yang Kai said solemnly.

“Ghost Ancestor, considering Brother Yang kept his word and successfully brought you out of there, you……” Shen Tu began to reason calmly, but before he finished the Ghost Ancestor coldly glared at him. Shen Tu immediately winced in pain, clutched his head, and let out a miserable howl.

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly.

“Senior……” Yue Xi cried out in a strained voice.

The Ghost Ancestor turned to her; Yue Xi's face drained pale and she screamed in agony just like Shen Tu.

“I am the Ghost Ancestor; I have never been a man of trust. Believing me was your greatest mistake!” the Ghost Ancestor sneered.

His form suddenly blurred. An ominous chill invaded Yang Kai's body as he hurried to channel his power, but before he could rend space, the cold presence entered him and froze him in place.

The vanished Ghost Ancestor reappeared before him, looking down on him with contempt.

“Indeed, I intended to kill you after you brought me off that continent. You know the reason: you've never truly sought to cooperate with me.” the Ghost Ancestor sneered. “You think I don't know your schemes? If not for my superiority, any Saint King Realm or even Origin Returning Realm warrior might have been killed by your tricks!”

Yang Kai remained silent because the Ghost Ancestor spoke the truth.

It was precisely because the Ghost Ancestor's strength was so high that Yang Kai's various schemes could not succeed.

“Half a cup of tea ago I still planned that way,” the Ghost Ancestor said, his expression changing oddly. “But now I've changed my mind. After all, you risked your life to save me—though not out of intention, merely because you went to rescue those girls. If I truly killed you, it would be ungrateful and make me a laughingstock.”

“I don't like owing favors. You brought me out and saved my life and gave me a chance at revenge, so I will spare you!”

Yang Kai's eyes shone with surprise as he stared at the Ghost Ancestor.

“Surprised? You think I'm heartless?”

Yang Kai frowned and after a moment said, “I don't think so. That you can carry a grudge for two thousand years suggests you're not without humanity; perhaps two thousand years ago you were still a good man.”

“Ha ha ha!” the Ghost Ancestor laughed aloud. “Good man? I might have been one back then, but two thousand years of loneliness changes anyone.”

“Boy, do you want to follow me?” the Ghost Ancestor asked in a low voice, his gaze burning on Yang Kai. “I find you pleasing. Follow me and I will guarantee you freedom across the Star Domain—no one will dare challenge you. I can also teach you cultivation so that in the shortest time you can reach the Origin Returning Realm. With your aptitude it might not even take a hundred years!”

Without thinking, Yang Kai shook his head, “I appreciate your kindness, Senior, but I do not wish to live that sort of life.”

“You refuse me?” the Ghost Ancestor looked at him in surprise. “You dare refuse me? Do you disdain me?”

His expression suddenly turned ferocious and violent, as if Yang Kai's reply displeased him and he might kill on the spot.

Yang Kai remained calm and smiled wryly, “You jest, senior. You are a Void King Realm Star Lord-level expert; surely anyone would want to rely on your protection. I admire you, not disdain you.”

“Then why refuse?”

Yang Kai frowned and pondered before replying, “I don't want to be a flower raised in a greenhouse—too delicate, unable to withstand wind and rain. I believe your words; with your guidance I could reach the Origin Returning Realm within a century, but perhaps in that environment it would be my limit. I wish to pursue higher realms—realms such as yours… those require tempering and slaughter!”

The Ghost Ancestor's displeasure faded into approval. He looked at Yang Kai approvingly and nodded slightly, “You make some sense. I won't force you. One day when you achieve enlightenment, you can come find me. My name will soon resound across the Star Domain; then finding me won't be difficult.”

“Then I wish you an early vengeance and the settling of your millennia-old grudge!” Yang Kai cupped his fist.

Those words touched the Ghost Ancestor's heart. His expression brightened and he chuckled lowly, “You speak well; I'm growing more fond of you. Fine, take this—it's of no use to me. Consider it a token of thanks for saving my life!”

Saying so, he flicked his hand and a pitch-black object flew toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it and looked it over; it was a token bearing the single large character meaning Emperor engraved upon it.

From that character emanated an oppressive aura that made Yang Kai nearly unable to breathe.

“Star Sect Token?” Yang Kai exclaimed in surprise.

He recalled that the token had been found by the Ghost Ancestor in Yue Xi's Spatial Ring, and when it had appeared, Yue Xi and Lü Guichen and the others had all gone pale.

He realized at once that the Star Sect Token was an object of great value coveted by all.

“Senior, this thing……”

“You don't know its purpose?” the Ghost Ancestor asked.

Yang Kai shook his head.

“Well, coming from a lower-tier continent you naturally wouldn't know. The Star Sect Token, also called the Star Emperor Token, is the token of the Star Domain's Emperor!”

“The Star Domain's Emperor?” Yang Kai's eyes gleamed with curiosity.

“He's merely a legend—the Star Domain was once controlled by one man, the Star Domain Emperor! His cultivation reached heaven and earth, unmatched through the ages; even I may not equal him. When he ruled the Star Domain he made ten Star Emperor Tokens, each of which sealed within it one of his divine arts—abilities capable of destroying a star!”

Yang Kai's face changed drastically, his eyes nearly bulging as he finally understood why Lü Guichen, Yue Xi, and others had fought over the Star Emperor Token and fully grasped its preciousness.
