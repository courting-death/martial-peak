## Chapter 1075 — Black Pot

Yang Kai truly had no idea how to refine a Pill Cloud.

When he refined that final Leaving Flame Pill, his mind was utterly clear, he felt no pressure, and he had an unshakeable belief that he would succeed.

When the pill formed, Yang Kai distinctly felt much of his vitality being stripped away, which was what led to his present state of utter weakness.

If not for Yang Kai possessing the Demon God Golden Blood and its exceedingly vigorous life force, that final stripping alone would have been enough to kill him on the spot.

That Leaving Flame Pill was not a pill at all — it was a life!

That was why it now brimmed with vitality and overflowing energy, leaving even Zong Ao in astonished admiration.

Although he had succeeded once, if Yang Kai tried to refine another now, he absolutely could not reproduce it, because he no longer had that all-out, single-minded feeling he’d had then; that sensation was gone.

After explaining his thoughts clearly to Zong Ao, the old man finally calmed down. Deceiving himself, he came up with an elaborate justification about “profound intent” to soothe his wounded pride, insisting that Yang Kai’s ability to produce a Pill Cloud was entirely due to the influence of intent.

After centuries of studying alchemy, he still couldn’t match a youth under thirty; Zong Ao felt his life had been wasted and burned with shame and rage.

Fortunately, he wasn’t dead yet, and still had plenty of time to keep studying.

At the palace of the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch, Yang Kai carried Xue Yue inside, fed her the newly finished Leaving Flame Pill, and only after her vitality steadied did he step out of the room.

Turning a few corners, he saw Halika, Lin Mufeng and the others crowded around Zong Ao, their flattery like a tide, faces full of sycophantic adoration, endlessly praising the old man as if age only sharpened him and his alchemical skill was miraculous. They claimed that something like a Pill Cloud could simply be produced by him, and he deserved their reverence.

Even the other top Void King-Grade alchemists in the Star Domain could not do this; they were merely a tier above Zong Ao on paper, a band of glory-seekers with no real skill beneath them — how could they compare to Senior Zong?

Zong Ao’s face flushed crimson as he bore their flattery with impatience, wanting to send them away, but lacking confidence and enduring it with great difficulty.

Stupid fools like Halika and Lin Mufeng showed no discernment and mistook his discomfort for enjoyment; their shameless praise only grew more intense and made the old man’s face even darker.

Then Yang Kai strolled out, relaxed. The flattering crowd ceased; they all regarded him with strange looks. Halika even quietly gave Yang Kai a thumb up with an expression of admiration, then he and Lin Mufeng clapped each other on the shoulders and took their leave.

The pair’s departing silhouettes had a distinctly collusive air about them.

Yang Kai came before Zong Ao with a puzzled look, unsure exactly what their gazes had meant.

“Boy, you’d hand over such a colossal advantage to this old man? The ability to produce a Pill Cloud, and to have Pill Patterns generate with a steady thirty to forty percent chance — with that alone you’d become a cherished guest of the Hengluo Commerce Guild. No one would dare touch you; you could have your own domain, servants, concubines, and the highest treatment. Things others chase their whole lives you’d snatch in an instant. With Hengluo’s capital, cultivating you wouldn’t be hard; you could reap the largest returns in the shortest time. I can’t fathom why you wouldn’t tell them the Leaving Flame Pill was made by you, and instead let me stand up and take the credit and the renown!” Zong Ao said slowly, lifting a cup of tea and taking a small sip.

Halika, Lin Mufeng and the others all believed the Leaving Flame Pill with a Pill Cloud had been made by Zong Ao, because Yang Kai had initially said so, and Zong Ao hadn’t contradicted them, which only strengthened their conviction.

That was why they praised Zong Ao so effusively.

Yang Kai sat beside him, poured himself a cup, downed it at a gulp and chuckled: “Senior Zong, don’t pretend ignorance — everyone knows the taller the tree the harsher the wind. I’m under thirty, I’ve got some tricks, but my cultivation is still too low; I can’t bear such immense favor and fame. Only someone like you, with virtue and reputation and the title of an alchemical master, can make those honors stick. Tell me, do you believe that if the two of us were to each take a Leaving Flame Pill with Pill Patterns to Chairman Ai Ou, we’d be treated the same? You’d be all the more revered; Chairman Ai Ou would treat you with even more courtesy — maybe he’d be in a good mood and award you a Medicine Star, make you the lord of that Medicine Star. Me? He’d lock me up, assign experts to guard me, not let me leave my territory, only let me handle herbs every day. Maybe when I was in bed enjoying pleasures with a beauty someone would be outside peeking with wide eyes…”

“Hahaha!” Zong Ao burst into laughter at Yang Kai’s words, picturing the ridiculous scene and laughing heartily, nodding repeatedly: “You’re slippery and cunning, boy — truly no good! I don’t know what storms you’ve weathered to grow these little tricks.”

“If I didn’t have such tricks, I’d be dead already!” Yang Kai shrugged.

“You’re right — the taller the tree, the harsher the wind! I’ll take those honors and benefits for you. Besides, my alchemical skill has indeed leapt forward; I’m worthy of it!”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, and he quickly rose to offer his congratulations.
“Congratulations, Senior Zong! This junior has been so busy with the matter of the Leaving Flame Pill lately that I failed to notice you had advanced further along the path of Alchemy — truly, an unpardonable oversight!”

He sat back down and added, worried: “But Senior Zong, if you push things like this you might have no choice but to join the Hengluo Commerce Guild. They once indulged you, let you be, but that may no longer be possible. If I’m not mistaken, Halika and Lin Mufeng have already reported this to Shuiyue Star; it won’t be long before Hengluo people arrive.”

“I know,” Zong Ao nodded. “I’ve dawdled on Rainfall Star for a century; as long as they don’t interfere with my alchemy, joining or not is only nominal. If they anger me, can’t I just leave?”

Yang Kai felt a twinge of guilt. Zong Ao was no good man—odd-tempered and arrogant—and Yang Kai knew he had made attempts on his life more than once in the past.

Yet whatever else, this time Zong Ao was taking the blame; though it would enlarge his reputation, it wasn’t what Zong Ao truly desired. Real masters don’t care about fame; only those who chase power and wealth claw their way up.

This time Yang Kai had burdened Zong Ao, costing him much freedom. Yang Kai guessed Zong Ao accepted it for the sake of the alchemical method he’d been taught, offering no complaint.

Both Yang Kai and Zong Ao understood these things in their hearts.

“How is that girl doing?” Zong Ao changed the subject, unwilling to talk further.

“The poison of the Profound Yin Moon Water should be dispelled; her vitality is steady, but she’s still unconscious. To awaken her we must find her Spirit Body,” Yang Kai frowned; he had checked within Xue Yue’s Sea of Consciousness again but found no trace of her Spirit Body and had no idea where it might be hidden.

Zong Ao frowned as well and said calmly: “By rights, being harmed by Profound Yin Moon Water shouldn’t cause this… her Spirit Body’s disappearance must have other reasons.”

Yang Kai’s spirit jolted: “Please, Senior Zong, enlighten me.”

Zong Ao shook his head. “I know nothing about that girl—what could I possibly teach you? Since you’re her guard, you should understand her better than I do. Sometimes, when a person falls unconscious, it doesn’t mean they’re injured — it’s that they can’t overcome the barrier within their own heart. Once she crosses that hurdle, she’ll naturally wake.”

Yang Kai took the words in, a pensive expression crossing his face. After a moment his eyes brightened as if he’d thought of something.

Zong Ao observed and gave a slight nod.

This boy is shrewd and capable; Zong Ao couldn’t understand why someone like him would serve as another’s guardian.

After a long while, Yang Kai suddenly relaxed.

“Found the reason?” Zong Ao asked with a smile.

“There are some clues; whether they’re right remains to be verified.” Yang Kai chuckled, then recalled something and asked: “By the way Senior Zong, when I came over earlier why did Halika and the others look at me like that? Did something happen?”

“Want to know?” Zong Ao cast him a sidelong glance.

Yang Kai nodded.

“I told them you were head-over-heels for that girl, that when you fed her medicine you chewed it and fed it to her mouth-to-mouth.” Zong Ao wrinkled his face and made lecherous gestures, as disgusting as one could be.

Yang Kai exploded in anger: “You’d actually spread that? Have you no shame?”

Zong Ao snorted: “I took a great fall for you, losing so many benefits and gifts to your hand; you think that’s the end? Just wait until Young Master Xue Yue descends on Rainfall Star and tears you limb from limb. Haha — a mere bodyguard daring to set his sights on Xue Yue’s woman, truly clueless. If I were you, I’d leave while I can!”

He laughed and left in high spirits.

You immortal old bastard!

Yang Kai glared bitterly at Zong Ao, instantly realizing why Halika, Lin Mufeng, and the others had been looking at him so strangely. Whatever lingering guilt he’d felt toward the old man vanished completely. He even regretted not raising the stakes higher in their wager back then—he should’ve taken all of Zong Ao’s Profound Yin Moon Water and pill furnaces for himself.

Old bastards really are all terrible!

So was the Ghost Ancestor, and so was Zong Ao!

But Zong Ao could never have suspected that the ‘girl’ he mentioned, the 'Lady Xue' Halika spoke of, was in fact Xue Yue herself!

What’s so great about kissing Xue Yue’s woman? I’ve seen and felt up Xue Yue’s whole body already!
