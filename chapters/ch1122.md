## Chapter 1122 — You Are Very Arrogant

Seeing Wu Yi silently weeping, Yu Feng's anger flared to the heavens; without a second thought he stepped up beside her, balling his fists and staring furiously at the elder called Ba Qingyan.

"Bastard!" Ba Qingyan grew even angrier. Wu Yi had dared to question his decision and openly oppose him — and she was only a woman; sooner or later she'd leave the Haike Family. He hadn't expected one of her subordinates to look at him with such a severe expression. What kind of decorum was this?

“Little Yi, it seems you truly haven’t been disciplined properly these past few years. Do you now dare to defy the elders of the clan so casually?” A man who had been standing silently to the side finally spoke. He appeared to be in his thirties, his cultivation at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, and judging by his attire, his position within the Haike Family was not low. With a stern expression, he said, “Hurry and apologize to Elder Ba. You know well that the elders’ words are absolute. Don’t be stubborn and ruin your own future.”

He wore an air of righteousness, as if speaking in Wu Yi's favor, but once her cousin uttered those words Wu Yi knew there would be no room for reversal.

The elders' rulings truly were absolute; they never changed. His cousin's remarks were plainly meant to stir the waters.

Sure enough, no sooner had he finished speaking than Ba Qingyan snorted coldly: "Apologize? I act for the family's sake — she needs no apology. Take her back to the clan to receive the family law!"

Saying that, he turned his gaze to Yu Feng and said, "You won't escape either!"

Yu Feng's face went pale as he stared blankly at Wu Yi; the sudden calamity left him stunned.

A hidden joy flickered across the eyes of the man in his thirties, though he still wore an anxious expression. He kept pleading Wu Yi's case before Ba Qingyan, speaking well of her and listing, one by one, the contributions she had made to the family over the years.

His words had no effect; they only poured fuel on the fire and gave people the impression that Wu Yi was growing arrogant from favor.

"What did I do wrong?" Wu Yi suddenly wiped her eyes and fixed her stubborn gaze on her cousin and Ba Qingyan, her lips bitten until blood appeared. "I did nothing wrong — you're the ones bullying the weak!"

"Ha!" Ba Qingyan sneered with fury. "You dare speak to me like that? You’re courting death!”

Wu Yi gave a desolate smile. "I won't stay in such a family. From today on I sever my ties with the Haike Family; I will have nothing more to do with you. As for the family law, I won't accept it!"

"You..." Ba Qingyan never expected such rebellious words from a mere girl and was momentarily stunned.

All of the Haike Family's cultivators fell silent, staring at Wu Yi in disbelief. None had expected her to cut ties with the family over a lowly unknown martial artist; such a thing had never happened before.

It was always the family who abandoned disciples, never a disciple who easily left the clan — that was a contempt for the family, an insult!

Wu Yi's cousin Wu Ke rejoiced inwardly. Though she was a woman, her aptitude and methods outmatched his. Over the years he had not belittled her and had even studied her carefully. He knew Wu Yi harbored ambitions to take control of the family, and if the elders truly favored her she might one day control the Haike Family.

Although the clan's upper echelons had low expectations of her because she was a woman, anything could happen — what if those old men lost their wits and named Wu Yi the family's heir?

Now that Wu Yi had thoroughly broken with Elder Ba and declared she would leave the family, he felt pleasantly surprised.

Wu Ke was ecstatic but kept his face calm, subtly glancing toward Yang Kai. He wondered if Wu Yi had fallen for that man and thus defended him so recklessly. Whatever the reason, he intended to thank Yang Kai in his heart — if not for that inexplicable man, his cousin might have become a formidable rival.

"Miss..." Yu Feng pressed his pale lips together and called to Wu Yi in a voice of bewildered helplessness. Shocked by her words, he soon hardened like her and said in a low voice, "Wherever you go, Miss, Yu Feng will follow."

"Thank you, Yu Feng!" Wu Yi looked at him apologetically, then grew sad and said, "I'm sorry."

She knew she had implicated Yu Feng; whatever she said now could not spare him from the family's punishment. Leaving the family together might be the best choice.

“Miss, what are you saying?” Yu Feng grinned. “If you hadn’t saved me five years ago, that Armored Beast would’ve torn me apart long ago—I wouldn’t even be alive today. I made up my mind back then that from that day on, I would follow you wherever you go.”

"What a moving scene of master and servant devotion!" Xu Zhishen suddenly clapped and laughed, mockingly turning to Ba Qingyan. "Ba brother, who'd have thought to see such a play in your family today — my own rage has lessened."

Since the Haike Family began its uproar he's done nothing, merely watching with amusement.

The Haike Family and his Xu Family are of comparable strength and adjacent in territory; they've traded and had small skirmishes. Such an incident in their neighbor's clan was something he enjoyed; he could recount it to friends back home.

Xu Zhishen's sarcastic taunts made Ba Qingyan's face ugly; his eyes toward Wu Yi were filled with murderous intent.

Family infighting might be internal affairs, but making a spectacle for outsiders enraged Ba Qingyan. He wanted nothing more than to cripple Wu Yi and drag her back to receive the family law.

"Brother Ba, settle your household matters privately; I couldn't care less. I'm here to slay this little beast who injured Tianze!" Having had his fun, he pointed at Yang Kai with a mocking grin. "Little vermin, always hiding behind women — looks like you're just a freeloader. Crawl out and die!"

Yang Kai had watched coldly the whole time; even when Wu Yi was scolded by her clan elders and declared she would leave the Haike Family, he remained silent.

It was none of his business; although he had been the cause, speaking then would only have made matters worse.

Now that Wu Yi had announced her departure, Yang Kai knew part of it was his doing and part was because she had grown cold toward the clan.

In any case, he was grateful to Wu Yi; for a woman to achieve such resolve had been difficult for her.

He quietly vowed to properly repay Wu Yi, to do his utmost to fulfil her wishes and show her the world beyond Dark Star.

A woman like her should not be bound within a tiny little family!

With that thought he stepped forward, lightly patting Wu Yi's shoulder and pulling her behind him. He glanced at Xu Zhishen and sneered, "Old dog, you're very arrogant."

Xu Zhishen's eyes grew cold and he nodded. "Fine, fine — your arrogance is high; I hope you're more than just sharp words!"

As he spoke, a chill soulwave drifted from his eyes like a sharpened blade and shot into Yang Kai's skull.

Yang Kai had once crippled Xu Tianze into a fool using soul force; Xu Zhishen knew this well. Now he intended to repay like with like. Seeing Yang Kai was only Third Stage of the Saint Realm — a full realm below him — Xu Zhishen did not use his full strength; he wanted to torture Yang Kai and teach him the price of boasting.

The cold soul force entered Yang Kai's sea of consciousness, but it was extinguished by the burning of his Divine Sense Fire without even causing ripples — nothing remained. The backlash even injured Xu Zhishen's own soul, making his complexion considerably pale.

"You..." Xu Zhishen stared at Yang Kai in disbelief. In that instant he had felt a soul fluctuation stronger than his own Divine Sense that burned his soul. Had he not held back, kept something in reserve, that backlash alone would have killed or badly wounded him.

Xu Zhishen's face shifted as his eyes scanned Yang Kai, trying to find some explanation.

He refused to believe Yang Kai possessed such Divine Sense cultivation; he suspected Yang Kai wore some powerful divine-soul secret treasure.

Yet after searching for a long while, he found no clue, and his heart trembled in horror.

Among those present, apart from the elder Ba Qingyan whose strength matched Xu Zhishen's, most were not highly cultivated — the majority were in the Saint Realm, a few at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm — they had no idea what had just happened. As Xu Zhishen struck, everyone watched, expecting to witness Yang Kai's miserable fate.

Unexpectedly Yang Kai remained unmoved; it was Xu Zhishen who turned pale as if wounded, which left them bewildered.

Only Ba Qingyan's eyes flickered as he stared intently at Yang Kai, seeming to discover something, but he soon shook his head and dismissed his suspicion — he didn't think Yang Kai's strength could harm Xu Zhishen.

Yet Xu Zhishen's soul aura was clearly much weaker, not a fake. He could not understand why.

“Old dog, are you going to fight or not? If you’re not, I’m making my move!” Yang Kai grinned at Xu Zhishen. Back when he had just advanced to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, he had already been able to slay cultivators of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. Now, with his body brimming with Golden Blood, his vitality and life force were far beyond what they once were. It was rare to have a Saint King Third Stage expert to use as practice, and he was eager to find out just where his limits lay.

Saying that, a longsword rolled into being in his hand, black and blazing with Demonic Flame.

At the sword's appearance the Haike and Xu family members all showed shock; the two strongest, Ba Qingyan and Xu Zhishen, were especially grave as they stared hard at the pitch-black Demonic Flame.
