## Chapter 663 — Seizing the Initiative

After Li Rong finished speaking, Yang Kai fell silent for a long time.

If everything this woman said was true, Yang Kai could understand why her attitude toward him had suddenly changed; she had recognized the World-Ending Demon Eye of the Great Demon God.

But a single person's testimony alone was not sufficient to be believed.

"What a coincidence. The reason I ended up here was entirely because I was inadvertently captured by the Coffin-Bearer. Are you sure that thing in my Sea of Consciousness really is the World-Ending Demon Eye?" he asked.

"Certain." This time not only did Li Rong nod, but Hua Mo and Han Fei also displayed approving expressions. "The blood of the Ancient Demon Clan runs through us; our forebears served the Great Demon God as servants — we will not be mistaken. Besides, who can say there is not some guidance from the Great Demon God behind this fate?"

"Even so... you needn't imitate your ancestors' ways and serve me as Lord. As for that... hehe, forgive my frankness, I'm not particularly interested." Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Li Rong looked surprised; after a moment's thought she suddenly understood what Yang Kai was apprehensive about.

Although his Demon God Transformation could suppress all members of the Ancient Demon Clan, his cultivation now was only at the Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage; without the Demon God Transformation many clan members could easily end his life.

To compel an entire race into submission, absolute force was indispensable.

"If the Lord worries about his own strength, there is no need." Li Rong declared. "The three of us state our position here — what we put our faith in is not who you are now but your future! I believe that since the World-Ending Demon Eye chose you, your future achievements will surely not fall short of the Great Demon God."

"You flatter me too much." Yang Kai shook his head with a bitter smile; his expression turned solemn as he said in a low voice, "Let's leave that matter for now. I'm more interested in other things."

"Please speak, Lord." Li Rong had no intention of forcing Yang Kai to agree on the spot; she knew that pressing him might have the opposite effect — the human still harbored suspicions toward the Ancient Demon Clan.

"I've heard that inside Mo Shen Fort there are martial skills specifically for cultivating the Demon God Transformation?" he asked.

Li Rong's face brightened into a radiant smile. "Even if the Lord does not ask, I will open those secret manuals to you. The Lord's Demon God Transformation should have come from the World-Ending Demon Eye, yes? If so, then it is the most authentic Demon God Transformation; the Lord's body flows with the Great Demon God's power and should naturally have some understanding of these things."

Yang Kai remained silent.

Li Rong's assumption, however, was incorrect. Before arriving in the Small Xuan Realm he had no knowledge of what the Demon God Transformation was. Furthermore, his method of Entering the Demonic State did not come from the World-Ending Demon Eye but was probed from secrets within the Indomitable Golden Body.

"Lord, I'll speak plainly — please don't be angry." Li Rong covered her mouth and laughed softly as she observed Yang Kai's expression.

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders.

"Although your Demon God Transformation is violent and possesses enough force to restrain every member of my clan, your comprehension of the technique seems shallow and cannot bring forth its full might. To put it plainly, your Demon God Transformation is still stuck at the initial stage."

Yang Kai was taken aback, then quickly realized and exclaimed with delight, "You mean my Demon God Transformation can still grant me greater power?"

"Indeed." Li Rong nodded. "If you remain as you are, how could our Ancient Demon Clan stand by you and fight alongside you?"

Whenever Yang Kai activated the Demon God Transformation, every member of the Ancient Demon Clan became like wooden posts; should they encounter an enemy, they would likely die in vain. Even someone as formidable as Li Rong could not move a finger — any random martial artist could slay her.

"At the very least, you must cultivate the Demon God Transformation to the Second-Tier Stage. Only at the Second-Tier Stage can you temper and restrain the might that overpowers my clan; then we can fight shoulder to shoulder." Li Rong said solemnly.

"That is interesting." Yang Kai smiled. Until he possessed absolute strength to subdue the Ancient Demon Clan, he had no interest in Li Rong and the others declaring they would serve him — his ability could not command them. Even if he accepted, failing to produce results would only make them grow cold and eventually despise him.

Having experienced the Yang Family's Succession War, Yang Kai had some understanding of how to manage subordinates.

But regarding the Demon God Transformation, he truly cared.

He never let go of any method that could strengthen his own power.

"You can seek me out at any time to request those secret manuals." Li Rong inclined her head slightly.

"Tomorrow, then. You've told me so much today; I need to think it through." Yang Kai said.

"Very well. Your subordinate will await the Lord's arrival."

"Don't call me that; it feels awkward." Yang Kai frowned. The more he mulled over the word 'Lord,' the more ill at ease he felt.

"Then... how would you like to be addressed? We will follow your preference."

"Let's keep it as before." Yang Kai smiled. "If your clansmen heard you calling me 'Lord,' they would not know what to make of it and it could very well spark unnecessary disputes."

Li Rong laughed softly. "You worry too much. From top to bottom the Ancient Demon Clan follows the order of its leaders; if the three of us approve, everyone will approve. But since you insist, I will not force it. I've said what needed to be said; rest now — we shall take our leave."

Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

Li Rong and Hua Mo inclined their heads to Yang Kai, and their spirit bodies swiftly withdrew.

Han Fei, however, did not leave; her expression grew slightly complicated as she lingered in place.

"Anything wrong?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"It's nothing — I only wished to thank you for saving me beneath the volcano."

"You saved me too. No one owes the other anything." Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

"Mm, in a few days I'll send you something — it may help you."

"What is it?"

"You'll know when the time comes." Han Fei said, and then promptly withdrew from Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

When Yang Kai opened his eyes again, he found the three leaders still standing before him. Li Rong smiled, "I forgot to ask — would you like to change your dwelling? Consider this place the Alchemy Room for pill-refining."

Previously, unable to confirm Yang Kai's mysteries, Li Rong had, despite caring for him, refrained from offering him superior conditions for fear of arousing suspicion among her subordinates; now that matters were settled, she naturally wanted to provide Yang Kai with better space to perform and a more comfortable environment.

"No need. This is quite convenient. If I want to refine pills I can begin at any time." Yang Kai said, shaking his head faintly.

"Regarding the matter of pill-refinement..." Li Rong's expression turned a little awkward. "It used to be a cooperative trade between you and my clan; now it is my clan's request. If you do not wish to refine..."

"You needn't worry. I've always wanted to study alchemy; I should thank you for offering such a fine opportunity."

Hearing this, Li Rong could not help but breathe a sigh of relief and looked at Yang Kai with gratitude.

Now that their statuses were different, Li Rong could no longer harshly compel Yang Kai to continue pill-refinement; if he refused, she would have no recourse.

"Shall I send a few maidservants to attend to you? My clan's young women, in both looks and temperament, are no worse than humans..." Li Rong bit her thin lip and blushed slightly as she asked.

Hua Mo's expression remained indifferent, as though human lust were natural and unavoidable.

Han Fei could not help but cough lightly; her face grew awkward and she turned her gaze away.

"Guan'er will do; no need for others." Yang Kai knew exactly whom Li Rong meant. As a young man, such needs were perfectly normal; after over a year here he had not been near women. Li Rong was clearly considering his feelings — perhaps with deeper intentions and plans.

If Yang Kai were to develop feelings for some girl among the clan, it would be all the easier for them to bind themselves to him.

"Very well." Li Rong nodded lightly, a flash of satisfaction crossing her eyes as she turned to Guan'er and said, "You will care for him as before; any of his requests must be met."

"Any request? What about requests that are too excessive?" Guan'er asked in astonishment.

"Even those are to be fulfilled. His word is an order!" Li Rong said sharply.

Guan'er was stunned. The last time she had been assigned to care for Yang Kai, Li Rong had told her to satisfy the human's demands only so long as they were not excessive — but now she was to fulfill any request!

Lady Li's attitude toward this human was truly different.

As Guan'er came to her senses, Li Rong and the others had already departed; when she reacted, only Yang Kai and she remained in the stone chamber.

She snorted and stalked forward, baring her claws like a little tiger. Through gritted teeth she snapped, "You bastard, what exactly did you say to my Lady? Why is she taking such care of you now?"

"Didn't say anything — just chatting casually."

"Humans really are deceitful and sly!" Guan'er looked at him in disbelief, then snorted, "Lady said to meet any of your demands. You won't make any shameless requests, will you?"

"I won't."

"Really won't? I don't believe you. Swear it to me."

Yang Kai inhaled deeply, feeling a headache from the girl's incessant nagging. After thinking a moment, he produced a crystal stone and handed it to Guan'er. "Play with this and stop bothering me!"

Guan'er looked disdainful and sneered, "One crystal stone to bribe me? You really look down on people, don't you?"

Yang Kai handed over another one.

Guan'er accepted it with glee and vanished, overjoyed.

The stone chamber instantly became quiet.

Recalling the earlier conversation in his Sea of Consciousness with the three leaders, Yang Kai still felt it all somewhat unreal.

Over the past year, although he had been absorbed in studying alchemy, he had constantly considered his future path and plans; he could not be confined here by the Ancient Demon Clan for the rest of his life.

Unexpectedly, a single accident had put him completely in control of the initiative.

As such, he no longer needed to worry about whether he would be imprisoned. Whether Li Rong's words were entirely trustworthy, Yang Kai did not know, but he felt the woman had no reason to deceive him; her show of weakness and friendliness brought her no advantage.

Yang Kai's subconscious still harbored some trust in her.

Moreover, this conversation had clarified for Yang Kai many questions that had puzzled him for years!

At the very least, he understood that the original owner of his Wordless Black Book was the Great Demon God!
