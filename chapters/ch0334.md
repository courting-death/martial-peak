## Chapter 334 — How Come It’s You

“Indeed, it’s better not to go.” Leng Shan kindly reminded, “What if you get entangled by those evil spirits? How will you escape?”

Tao Yang furrowed his brows and said, “Brother Yang, this matter should be considered longer.”

“I know my limits!” Yang Kai calmly shook his head, “The cultivation method I practice and the attribute of my True Essence can restrain these evil spirits. They might not be able to do anything to me.”

“But... what if those two girls don’t understand the situation either? Wouldn’t you be going for nothing?” Shen Yi still felt some unease and slowly shook his head, his expression grave. The present situation was too dangerous. If anything happened to Yang Kai, the defensive strength of the group would drop significantly since Yang Kai’s True Essence could effectively restrain the evil spirits.

Right now, the evil spirits beneath the high platform didn’t seem too threatening, but who could guarantee they wouldn’t suddenly attack?

If Yang Kai was there at that time, even if he fought desperately to kill his way out, there might still be a chance of survival.

“Why not... call them over?” suggested Zhao Rong, a girl from the Baoqi Sect.

Everyone looked at her with strange expressions.

“What is it?” Zhao Rong asked, puzzled, her big eyes blinking.

Tao Yang forced a smile, “Those people over there have grievances with those two girls, so they won’t come over.”

“I still think it’s better for me to go. It shows sincerity,” Yang Kai decided firmly, “Moreover, their strength isn’t weak; if we can recruit them to join us, it would provide us with another layer of protection!”

“That’s true.” Leng Shan’s beautiful eyes brightened a bit, “If you can indeed persuade them, our Ghost King Valley will guarantee they won’t face any trouble anymore. After all, it doesn’t matter to us if a few people from the Xiaoyao Sect die.”

Shen Yi slightly nodded, seriously stating, “Then Brother Yang, please be careful. If things go awry, return immediately!”

“Understood.” Yang Kai responded, and with a leap, he directly dashed toward that side.

Seeing him so brave and skilled, everyone couldn’t help but admire him.

In the blink of an eye, he had leaped several zhang and quickly approached the stone platform where the two women were resting.

Upon sensing Yang Kai’s arrival, the two women suddenly stood up, their True Essence surging, their beautiful eyes filled with frost, ready to attack.

Yang Kai activated his True Yuan, exuding pure and scorching Yuan Qi while dodging the flying evil spirits. Fortunately, at that moment, the dense killing intent below was greatly alluring to the evil spirits, so he encountered no trouble.

A moment later, Yang Kai called out to them, “Ladies, please don’t misunderstand. I only came to investigate the situation and mean no harm.”

As his voice echoed, the two vigilant women suddenly relaxed, looking at him with surprise.

Uncertain about what had happened on their side, to ease their apprehension, Yang Kai could only stop in mid-air and sincerely said, “Ladies…”

Before he finished speaking, he was interrupted from their side: “Is that you, Yang Kai?”

The voice trembled slightly, filled with disbelief, a mix of surprise and joy.

“Uh…” Yang Kai was taken aback. The voice coming from the other side was somewhat familiar, and a girl’s face involuntarily flashed in his mind. He focused on that direction and found, indeed, two charming girls standing on the stone platform, perfectly matching the impression in his mind.

The two of them had similar appearances; their expressions and physiques were indistinguishable as if carved from the same mold.

Both were exquisite and elegant, with tiredness hidden on the contours of their faces, yet their beautiful eyes sparkled with vibrant energy.

At such a close distance, they could clearly see each other’s faces.

“It really is you!” The girl on the other side was elated.

Yang Kai no longer hesitated as he rushed over, landing on the high platform, astonished, “How come it’s you two?”

Previously, he had heard from the people of Ghost King Valley that the Xiaoyao Sect was pursuing a pair of exceptionally powerful twins who had killed several members from the Xiaoyao Sect.

Yang Kai hadn’t thought much of it since although twins were rare, they weren’t exactly unheard of.

In those he knew, there had been no pair that were twins. Only the alluring duo from the Blood Battle Gang, who looked alike but were actually several years apart in age and not true twins.

Thus, he never considered that the ones being pursued by the Xiaoyao Sect would be them.

Hu Jiao’er, Hu Mei’er!

It had been a long time since he last saw them.

The last time was in the Inheritance Celestial Cave when the three had walked side by side up the tens of thousands of zhang staircase. Whenever the cold energy rushed over, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er would cuddle close to Yang Kai for warmth.

The memories of sharing difficulties were still fresh, bringing warmth whenever he thought of them.

Just like that, nearly two years had passed.

Yang Kai had grown from the Open Origin Realm to the True Essence Realm Fifth Stage.

And the two from the Blood Battle Gang had evidently made significant advancements!

One of the girls looked at Yang Kai with bright smiles, her beautiful eyes overflowing with joy from the long-awaited reunion, while the other was gritting her teeth, glaring coldly, coming up to question, “I’d like to ask, how come it’s you, you little brat!”

Seeing them suddenly, Yang Kai felt uplifted and grinned widely, “Jiao'er!”

The girl who spoke blushed, now even more irate: “You rascal, you recognized me again.”

“I wouldn’t have noticed if you hadn’t spoken.” Yang Kai laughed. It had been a long time, and the resemblance between the two sisters had grown stronger. If it weren’t for their differing personalities, it would be impossible to distinguish them. However, Hu Jiao’er was undoubtedly more aggressive than her sister, having the audacity to call Yang Kai a rascal like that.

Back then, Yang Kai had teased her about the unevenness of her backside and had taken advantage of her quite a bit.

“Mei’er!” Yang Kai nodded to the other girl.

“Mm.” Hu Mei’er bit her red lip and smiled gently, her eyes shimmering beautifully.

“You’re so intimate; your skin is really thick!” Hu Jiao’er spat out, but Yang Kai could tell that her mood wasn’t bad either.

Reuniting with old friends in a foreign land felt like this.

The beautiful eyes scanned Yang Kai up and down, and Hu Jiao’er exclaimed, “You’ve grown quite a bit since I last saw you.”

Yang Kai had been skinny and pitiful back then, but he was much more impressive now.

There was one thing Hu Jiao’er had hesitated to bring up all this time. Years ago, when she had teased Yang Kai while lying on top of him, her softness had poked his ribcage, causing her pain for quite a while.

“You two have also become prettier.” Yang Kai casually flattered.

The alluring duo exchanged glances and laughed lightly, shaking like flowers, their fatigue seemingly swept away, appearing remarkably energetic.

“You’re such a smooth talker!” Hu Jiao’er chided him, “Now you can fly in the air; you’ve reached the True Essence Realm too.”

“Mm…” Yang Kai nodded slightly. As his Divine Sense swept over them, his expression suddenly turned grave, gazing at Hu Mei’er with astonishment.

“What’s wrong?” Hu Mei’er blushed under his stare.

“Your strength…”

“True Essence Realm Fourth Stage!” Hu Jiao’er giggled, her expression playful and somewhat proud.

Without her reminding, Yang Kai had already sensed it.

True Essence Realm Fourth Stage! It wasn’t particularly high, but what was strange was that both sisters were at True Essence Realm Fourth Stage.

Back then, Yang Kai and Hu Mei’er had been nearly at the same level, but after all this time, through various trials and opportunities, he had only reached True Essence Realm Fifth Stage.

Yet now, Hu Mei’er was only a layer below him. Their speed of cultivation was terrifying!

What concerned Yang Kai even more was Hu Jiao’er’s realm.

She had been on par with Su Yan back then, both being elite disciples from the three factions. But now, Su Yan had reached True Essence Realm Ninth Stage, and although she hadn’t attained Divine Roaming Realm, she was likely very close and might have already broken through to it.

In contrast, Hu Jiao’er was still at True Essence Realm Fourth Stage, a significant gap.

The younger sister cultivated at an astonishing speed, but the elder sister was progressing at a snail's pace; clearly, something was amiss!

Hu Jiao’er surely had a natural talent for cultivation; it didn’t make sense that her progress had been so slow in the last two years.

“Is it related to the opportunity you gained in the Inheritance Celestial Cave?” Yang Kai suddenly recalled a possible explanation.

“Mm.” The enchanting twins did not deny it. Hu Jiao’er nodded, “The inheritance we obtained is called the Consonant Spirit Technique, which is most suitable for twins. Although Mei’er and I are not true twins, since I raised her, our minds are more interconnected than even that of actual twins. After practicing this divine skill, our speeds have both doubled. But because Mei’er started at a lower point, we’ve only just reached True Essence Realm Fourth Stage now.”

“Impressive!” Yang Kai praised.

“And you?” 

“Fifth Stage.”

“You’re not too shabby either.” Hu Jiao’er laughed lightly, not probing further. She could naturally guess that Yang Kai had received the final inheritance.

The three chatted for a while when Hu Jiao’er suddenly changed her expression. She looked at Yang Kai warily and said, “Right, I forgot to ask. What exactly are you here for? Did you go to the Xiaoyao Sect after Lingxiao Pavilion was destroyed?”

“You’re overthinking it.” Yang Kai forced a smile.

“Stop right there, don’t come any closer!” Hu Jiao’er placed herself in front of her sister, sneering, “Why did you come with that group of losers just now? Don’t think I didn’t see; the person from Xiaoyao Sect told you to bring us sisters over. If you don’t clarify, I won’t let you near us.”

“Sister… he’s not that kind of person!” Hu Mei’er comforted.

“You can’t judge a person by their appearance. Hmph.” Hu Jiao’er scolded her sister, “If you don’t dig into his heart, you’ll never know whether he’s black or white.” 

“Alright, alright, I’ll tell you.” Yang Kai raised his hand helplessly and simply narrated the events that occurred after coming to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

“Is that true?” Hu Jiao’er tilted her head, staring at Yang Kai, seemingly unwilling to miss any change in his expression.

“Why would I lie to you?” Yang Kai said seriously, “I originally wanted to find out the situation here, see if you knew what had happened, and never expected it would be you two. But now that it’s you, let’s go together. It’s better to face things together.”

“Sister, let’s go.” Hu Mei’er obviously trusted Yang Kai and showed no sign of doubt.

Hu Jiao’er hesitated, unwilling to confront the ugly faces of those men from the Xiaoyao Sect, but staying here with her sister wasn’t a solution. She understood that Yang Kai wanted them to come for their sake as well. After pondering for a while, she finally said, “We can go, but we haven’t recovered our True Essence yet. Let’s wait until we’re back to our peak before moving.”

It was clear she didn’t fully trust the people from Ghost King Valley, which was why she had said that.
