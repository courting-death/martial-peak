## Chapter 95 — On the Other Side…

How could Nu Lang dare to defy Wen Feichen’s orders? No matter how weak the other party appeared, they were far beyond what he could handle. The two exchanged a glance before Nu Lang spoke, “May I ask, Senior Wen, are you absolutely certain that the woman has no means to resist?”

“Absolutely certain!” Wen Feichen replied patiently. “If you pursue her now, even one of you can easily capture her and bring her back to Young Master Long. You won’t be left empty-handed.”

“Very well. Then we shall give chase!” A wild and resentful gleam flashed in Nu Lang’s eyes. Over the past few days, the Fengyu Tower disciples had suffered greatly at the hands of the Blood Battle Gang who came with them. Not a single Body Tempering Realm disciple remained alive.

Unable to vent his anger on Wen Feichen, Nu Lang naturally directed it toward Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang.

Xia Ningshang was already powerless to resist; how could they possibly regard a mere Yang Kai as a threat?

After the Fengyu Tower disciples disappeared into the gloomy, sinister valley, Wen Feichen turned to the few remaining Blood Battle Gang disciples. “You must also go. Under no circumstances can that woman escape. There must be a powerful backer behind her. If word of this leaks, our gang will face tremendous trouble!”

“Yes!” Though weak and exhausted, the gravity of the matter compelled them to press on.

Soon, only Long Hui and Wen Feichen remained on the scene.

Long Hui’s tone softened somewhat as he asked, “Chief Wen, what exactly is going on?”

Wen Feichen gave a bitter smile. “I don’t know what methods that woman used, but my full strength was suppressed to only the third stage of Qi Movement! Those three chains that entered my body have locked the flow of my Primordial Qi and my dantian.”

“Such a technique exists?” Long Hui’s face turned pale with shock.

Wen Feichen nodded. “If it affects me like this, then those disciples are even more helpless. They can barely muster thirty percent of their true strength now.”

“What shall we do then?” Long Hui’s expression showed his unease.

“Do not worry!” Wen Feichen shook his head. “I did not deceive those Fengyu Tower disciples earlier. That woman expended tremendous effort and maintained a defensive treasure for a long time. Her internal Primordial Qi is now completely depleted. After I struck her once more, she truly has no chance but to surrender. Once we find them, what belongs to Young Master Long will indeed be yours.”

Hearing this, Long Hui finally exhaled in relief. His eyes darted as he said, “Earlier, I was so anxious that my tone was harsh. I hope Chief Wen will not take it to heart. Once this matter is resolved, I will report your hard work in detail to my grandfather.”

“Young Master Long is too polite; we are all family,” Wen Feichen said with a satisfied smile. “But for now, please protect me while I attempt to dispel the Yin Qi chains within my body.”

“Very well.”

Their conversation never once mentioned Yang Kai. In their eyes, Xia Ningshang was the true threat; Yang Kai was nothing but an insignificant annoyance. Now that Xia Ningshang’s Primordial Qi was utterly drained, she was like a hedgehog stripped of its spines—anyone could easily seize her.

At this moment, Yang Kai had already brought Xia Ningshang to the edge of the valley, to a narrow fissure barely ten zhang long, wide enough for only one person to slip through.

He placed Xia Ningshang inside, then stood guard outside. A thick bush concealed the entrance perfectly.

The two bodies pressed close, almost merging into one.

“Don’t speak. Someone is coming!” Yang Kai whispered, one arm around Xia Ningshang.

Xia Ningshang’s pale face nodded slightly as she held her breath.

Soon, Nu Lang and his men dashed past, their footsteps fading into the distance. Though only a dozen zhang separated them, the darkness and dense Yin Qi of the valley concealed Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang flawlessly.

Once Nu Lang and his group were gone, Xia Ningshang could no longer hold back and spat a mouthful of fresh blood. The silk scarf covering her face was instantly stained crimson. Wen Feichen’s palm strike had indeed injured her.

“How are you?” Yang Kai asked anxiously.

“Fetch me some pills!” Xia Ningshang’s voice was weak as her body went limp, collapsing to the ground without the strength to even move a finger.

“Where?”

“In my bosom!”

Yang Kai hurriedly reached into her chest, but immediately recoiled as if struck by lightning, staring blankly at his junior sister.

Xia Ningshang met his gaze, her pale face flushed with a faint blush, her body trembling slightly. Just a light touch from Yang Kai on her full jade peak had sent a paralyzing shock through her heart, nearly causing her to faint on the spot.

“Endure it!” Yang Kai knew the urgency of the moment and no longer hesitated. He whispered softly as he reached again beneath her clothing.

It was summer, and Xia Ningshang wore little—beneath her outer robes, only a thin undergarment remained. As Yang Kai’s hand explored, he felt as if he had entered a celestial realm that one could never tire of.

A plump softness, full of astonishing elasticity, neither too large nor too small, no bigger than a palm. His fingers occasionally brushed against a small protrusion atop the fullness, each touch causing Xia Ningshang’s body to tremble slightly. Feeling their shared burning warmth, within mere breaths both their breathing grew rapid, blood surging swiftly through their veins.

Yang Kai, though embarrassed, was still a man and shamelessly pretended nothing was amiss.

Xia Ningshang’s clear eyes seemed to hold a pool of spring water, her gaze both shy and angry, her breath fragrant and intoxicating beyond words.

“Don’t overthink it!” Yang Kai comforted her as he carefully searched.

Xia Ningshang could no longer hold back. Summoning her remaining strength, she weakly said, “The other side!”

“Oh!” Yang Kai suddenly snapped back to reality, thinking to himself why he had searched so long without finding anything—it was simply not on this side.

What a troublesome matter…

He reached into the other side, searching deeply again. Finally, he found several small bottles, though Xia Ningshang trembled countless times during the process.

“Which one?” Yang Kai asked.

“The middle one.” Xia Ningshang’s voice was extremely weak as she gestured with her eyes.

Yang Kai quickly took the middle bottle, poured some pills out, lifted her veil, and stuffed them into her mouth.

This junior sister’s constitution was special—the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body was the finest human vessel for medicine in the world. No matter how many pills she consumed, there would be no adverse effects.

After swallowing the pills, Xia Ningshang closed her eyes to meditate while Yang Kai turned to vigilantly watch the surroundings.

About half an hour later, Xia Ningshang gradually recovered and opened her eyes, looking at Yang Kai’s back with a mixture of shyness and complexity.

Recalling what had just happened, her cheeks burned like fire. Though she knew it was unavoidable, Xia Ningshang wished she could find a hole to hide in—she was utterly embarrassed.

As if sensing her gaze, Yang Kai, who had been on alert, suddenly turned around. Seeing that she had finished her cultivation, he involuntarily exhaled, “Are you alright now?”

A flicker of panic flashed in Xia Ningshang’s eyes, and she quickly averted her gaze. “Though my life is not in danger, I cannot fight anyone for the time being.”

“That’s good enough.” Yang Kai finally let out the breath he had been holding.
