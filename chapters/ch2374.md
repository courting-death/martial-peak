## Chapter 2374 — Slicing Vegetables, Chopping Melons

Ling Yinqin froze on the spot. Many years ago, a man had once said the same words to her. Even after all these years, she still remembered that man's smile and expression vividly. Now, in this moment, the figure before her overlapped with that memory, and she lost herself, seeing him in Yang Kai's place.

“Well said, but it’s meaningless.” Yang Leshui sneered. “This Lord wants to see how you plan to forge ahead in front of me!”

“Did you hit my Junior Sister?” Yang Kai looked at him coldly.

“That’s right.” Yang Leshui looked at Yang Kai with contempt. “To act so brazenly in front of this Lord, a slap was letting her off easy. If you dare to…”

He was still spouting threats, but before he could finish, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly vanished from sight.

In the next instant, Yang Kai appeared half a foot in front of him like a ghost. With a flick of his hand, he slapped Yang Leshui across the face.

Yang Leshui shuddered and instinctively twisted his body, trying to dodge. But Yang Kai was so fast it defied belief—before Yang Leshui could react, the slap landed hard across his face.

Smack…

Yang Leshui was sent flying, tumbling through the air, spitting out several teeth and a mouthful of blood before crashing heavily to the ground.

Silence. The entire deck was deathly silent.

Jiao Yi and the others stared in shock at this unbelievable scene, their legs nearly cramping. Ling Yinqin was also startled, her heart pounding in terror. Though she hadn’t interacted much with Yang Kai, her impression was that he wasn’t a hot-tempered person—he actually seemed rather courteous. She never expected that he would strike Yang Leshui so fiercely, and right in the face!

What now?

She had hoped to resolve this by paying them off, but now it was clear that was just her own wishful thinking.

No, wait… Yang Kai failed his breakthrough and even severed his own cultivation. He should be weak and drained, his strength greatly diminished. How could Yang Leshui, a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator, fail to dodge his attack, even if caught off guard?

But when Yang Kai struck just now, there was no sign of weakness or loss of strength. The Origin Qi fluctuations from that slap were exactly what a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm should display.

What’s going on with him? Ling Yinqin was thoroughly confused.

The group from Xuanyun Pavilion was also stunned. Here in the Jixu Sea, even on Tongtian Island, they had always been the ones to act high and mighty. Who would have thought they’d be slapped in the face like this one day? And the one who got slapped was their own Vice Pavilion Master! Their minds buzzed, nearly going blank.

“You… you dare hit me?” Yang Leshui climbed up from the ground, his face twisted in rage, spitting out blood as he glared at Yang Kai. “Do you know who this Lord is? You dare hit me?”

Yang Kai snorted, “To act so brazenly in front of this Young Master, a slap is letting you off easy. If you keep running your mouth, I’ll take your dog life!”

Yang Leshui froze, then burst into hysterical laughter. “Kill! Kill them all! I want every man on this ship dead, and every woman to wish they were!”

He was truly driven mad by Yang Kai, completely losing control, his face twisted with venomous hatred.

Ling Yinqin’s face changed drastically at his words. She hurriedly shouted, “Vice Pavilion Master Yang, please show mercy!”

Her ship only had a dozen or so crew, half of whom were Dao Origin Realm, the rest just Void King Realm. But the Xuanyun Pavilion group had at least thirty people, with over twenty in the Dao Origin Realm. No matter how she looked at it, they stood no chance. If a fight broke out, her people would be wiped out.

As the leader, she had to think of her crew.

Yang Leshui snarled, “It’s too late for words! Ling Yinqin, this Lord will personally deal with you—strip you naked and hang you at the gates of Tongtian City!”

His anger at Yang Kai now extended to Ling Yinqin as well. For a female cultivator, being stripped and hung at the city gates for all to see was the ultimate humiliation. Ling Yinqin’s heart instantly sank to the bottom.

Thud, thud, thud…

The Xuanyun Pavilion cultivators swarmed over, faces twisted and menacing, clearly intent on leaving Ling Yinqin’s group no way out.

Seeing this, Ling Yinqin knew things were beyond saving. She gritted her teeth and shouted, “Prepare to fight!”

Jiao Yi and the others steeled themselves, surging their Origin Qi and summoning their Secret Treasures.

Figures flickered. Yang Kai suddenly returned to stand before Jiao Yi and the others, facing the oncoming storm head-on.

“Be careful, Senior Brother!” Liu Qianyun also drew her Secret Treasure, calling out in concern.

“Take care of yourself.” As Yang Kai spoke, he twisted his wrist, and a broad longsword appeared in his palm, which he gripped tightly.

“Cut off his limbs and cripple his cultivation! I want him to know what happens to those who cross this Lord!” Yang Leshui’s eyes were bloodshot as he shouted at his men.

He was truly furious. No one had ever dared defy him, let alone slap him in front of so many people. Yang Kai was the first. His hatred for Yang Kai was so deep that even the waters of the Jixu Sea couldn’t wash it away. How could he let this go without venting his anger?

Yang Kai remained unmoved. Facing the dozens of ferocious attackers, he simply rotated his longsword slightly. Instantly, sword light surged, sword Qi soaring to the heavens.

“Myriad Sword radiance, chase the moon and swallow the wolf!”

The Myriad Sword swept out, a torrent of sword light shooting forward like a waterfall, its momentum unstoppable, shattering the sky.

Boom, boom, boom…

The front row of Xuanyun Pavilion cultivators hadn’t even realized what was happening before their defensive Secret Treasures and protective Origin Qi were shattered with ease. Then, pain struck, and they lost consciousness.

Crash…

On the deck, the stench of blood filled the air. The seven or eight cultivators in the front row fell like cut straw, blood and entrails spilling everywhere. The next row was also badly injured, writhing on the ground in agony.

The other Xuanyun Pavilion cultivators were so shocked by this turn of events that they froze, staring wide-eyed at Yang Kai, terror overflowing in their eyes.

“Imperial Aura… Imperial Treasure?” Yang Leshui, clutching his swollen face and ready to watch the show, suddenly cried out in shock. His eyes locked greedily onto Yang Kai’s Myriad Sword.

The moment Yang Kai acted, he sensed the aura of the Myriad Sword—this was an Imperial Treasure, a genuine Imperial Treasure! If he could obtain it, perhaps he could use its power to comprehend the mysteries of the Emperor Realm.

Who is this brat, and how does he have an Imperial Treasure?

Ling Yinqin and the others were dumbfounded.

They had thought they were doomed and were prepared to take a few enemies with them before dying. But before the enemy even reached them, more than a dozen had already fallen.

And all of this was caused by a single strike from Yang Kai!

What was going on?

Ling Yinqin stood dazed in the sea breeze, staring blankly at Yang Kai’s back. Wasn’t this man supposed to have failed his breakthrough and severed his cultivation? How could he unleash such power? Was that just now the might of an Imperial Treasure?

Yes, it had to be the power of the Imperial Treasure. Otherwise, with Yang Kai’s current state, he couldn’t possibly do this. She’d long heard of the might of Imperial Treasures, and now she saw it firsthand. But for Yang Kai to use up his remaining strength to wield it, the burden on him must be immense—this was likely a one-time move, and he couldn’t strike again.

“What are you all standing around for? He just failed his breakthrough and has no strength left! After one attack, he’s spent! What are you waiting for?” Yang Leshui, thinking the same as Ling Yinqin, saw his men frozen in fear and shouted at them in frustration, urging them to attack.

At his words, the Xuanyun Pavilion cultivators snapped out of their fear, their hesitation swept away, and their faces turned vicious.

Yang Kai grinned savagely. With a flick of both hands, two enormous Moon Blades spun out, like two pitch-black wheels crashing into the enemy ranks.

In the next instant, screams and cries filled the air. Wherever the Moon Blades passed, nothing could withstand them—anyone touched was sliced in two, dying on the spot.

“You refuse the road to heaven, but rush to hell instead! No one’s leaving alive today.” Yang Kai snorted coldly, his hands flickering as he sent out Moon Blade after Moon Blade. On the deck, the Xuanyun Pavilion cultivators wailed in terror.

A bunch of Dao Origin First and Second Stage, and Void King Realm trash—Yang Kai didn’t even need to take them seriously with his current means.

In just three breaths, of the more than thirty Xuanyun Pavilion cultivators, only five or six remained. The rest all lay dead on the deck.

“Run!” Someone shouted, leaping toward the sea, completely terrified by Yang Kai’s bloody methods. No one dared linger.

Seeing this, the others also lost the will to fight and fled in all directions.

Ling Yinqin’s face changed. She barked, “Chase them in pairs! Don’t let any escape!”

The battle had happened so fast, it was almost over before she could react. But seeing the survivors fleeing, she couldn’t just sit by. If any escaped and reported back to Tongtian Island, the Xuanyun Pavilion Master would never let this go.

That was an Emperor Realm expert—if he came after them, no one could resist.

Jiao Yi and the others obeyed and hurried after the fleeing enemies.

On the deck, the sea wind howled, the stench of blood was overwhelming, and the scene was like hell—utterly horrifying.

Yang Leshui was trembling all over, his face deathly pale as he stared at Yang Kai in utter terror. No matter how he racked his brain, he couldn’t understand how this young man, who had supposedly failed his breakthrough, could still possess such overwhelming power. In less than ten breaths, over thirty of his men had been slaughtered or crippled—now, in the blink of an eye, he stood alone, the last survivor.
