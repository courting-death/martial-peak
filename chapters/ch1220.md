## Chapter 1220 — Red Candle Fruit

A crimson sun slowly rose, startling every cultivator who was braving the Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

On a stretch of hills, five or six cultivators in golden long robes stood behind Qu Changfeng, faces full of astonishment as they stared toward the place where the red sun had risen. After the initial shock they began whispering among themselves, debating what on earth this could be. Qu Changfeng's expression, however, was as dark as a storm cloud. On this trip into the Flowing Flame Sandland he'd indeed seen many valuable things, yet none had brought him any substantial gain — the matter of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water in particular had become a sore spot in his heart. Now that such an anomaly had appeared in the heavens and earth, it immediately drew his attention.

After a moment's hesitation he waved his hand and barked, "Go take a look!"

He then led his fellow disciples and rushed toward the direction where the red sun had risen.

On another stretch of plain, four cultivators with dense and powerful Saint Yuan stood together. Arcs of lightning visibly danced across their bodies, and the Secret Treasures they wielded shot out bolts of lightning in all directions, their might truly formidable.

As the red sun rose, they had just finished wiping out a group of attacking Fire Spirit Beasts. One of them gathered the scattered crystal stones and, with the others, slowly approached a youth of steady countenance dressed in simple clothes.

"Senior Brother Fang, what is that?" someone asked.

The simply dressed youth shook his head slowly and said lightly, "Go see for yourself. When such a phenomenon appears in the Flowing Flame Sandland it's very likely some rare treasure has appeared."

Saying this, he walked straight toward the spot where the red sun rose, hands clasped behind his back. His pace seemed unhurried, yet bolts of lightning at his feet flashed and vanished; his figure drifted forward like a specter, and in the blink of an eye he covered dozens of zhang.

On an abrupt rock a man with a cold expression sat cross-legged, cultivating; he also lifted his gaze to where the red sun hung in the sky, and after a moment's thought he rose to his feet.

Deep within the Third Layer Heat-Flame Zone, a man in his thirties was painfully resisting the heat waves and fire toxins, apparently trying to press further inward. When the red sun rose he glanced back, then his face flushed with shock and wild joy as he murmured, "So this is what has ripened... hahahaha!"

With that he spun and dashed frantically toward the red sun's position, as if afraid some latecomer would snatch the prize from him.

Many similar scenes unfolded across the Third Layer — elite disciples who had entered this layer from numerous powers all surged toward the red sun, each guessing what had caused the phenomenon. Could it be some mighty treasure coming into being?

But before they could reach the red sun, a fierce scarlet gale suddenly blew toward them. That wind carried an intensely scorching aura that made every cultivator's face change; they hurriedly unleashed Saint Yuan to withstand it.

To everyone's surprise, after that seemingly formidable gale passed through, it did not injure anyone. Instead, a strange fragrance began to drift throughout the Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

It was a fruit fragrance that, upon a single inhalation, revived the spirit and even contained some peculiar power — indescribable, drawing one to sink into its scent and ponder.

But nobody stopped to contemplate; merely inhaling that scent produced such effects, and if one could seize the unknown treasure that emitted it, what unimaginable fortune would that be?

As the fruit aroma spread, everyone’s expressions brightened and their speed quickened.

At the edge of the dried-up lava lake, Yang Kai and the others were likewise struck by that scarlet gale. Once the miraculous fruit scent curled around his nostrils, Yang Kai shuddered and exclaimed in a low voice, "A spirit fruit has ripened!"

Only now could he be certain. The rising sunrise was not caused by a secret treasure nor the birth of some mighty artifact, but by a spirit fruit reaching maturity.

The ubiquitous fruit fragrance in the air was the best proof.

A nearly lost fruit name flashed through his mind. Almost simultaneously, Daiyuan cried out in shock, "Red Candle Fruit?"

Yang Kai looked at Daiyuan in surprise; he hadn't expected this disciple from Liuli Sect to know of such a heaven-defying spirit fruit. To his knowledge this fruit had nearly vanished from the world — like the Warm Spirit Lotus and the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, it existed only in rumor and folklore; no one alive had truly seen one.

That Daiyuan could identify it at once stunned Yang Kai.

"Red Candle Fruit?" Xuan'er — who was closest to Daiyuan — asked bluntly, "What is that?"

"A Void King-Grade Upper-Level spirit fruit!" Daiyuan gritted her teeth and pronounced each word.

Apart from Yang Kai, who had already guessed the truth, everyone else was shaken.

Dark Star was not without Void King-Grade herbs and medicines, but such things were exceedingly rare — perhaps one or two in decades, and even then nine times out of ten they were Void King-Grade Lower-Level; Middle-Level examples were virtually nonexistent.

Yet now, within the Third Stage of the Flowing Flame Sandland, a Void King-Grade Upper-Level spirit fruit had actually appeared.

"What does it do?" Xuan'er tried to steady her voice, though it trembled slightly.

The words Void King-Grade Upper-Level struck her heart like a heavy hammer.

"It has many uses. While it ripens, all cultivators can, through the fragrance it emits, comprehend wondrous principles to merge and advance their own cultivation. But that isn't the chief benefit — the main thing... it is said that devouring it grants a cultivator a chance to ascend to the Void King Realm!"

"What?" Wei Guchang could no longer remain calm.

Dark Star had never produced a Void King-Grade expert. If some power were to secure this so-called Red Candle Fruit and produce a Void King-Grade cultivator within their sect, could they not dominate the entire star?

As a core disciple, Wei Guchang well understood the implications.

If it were anything else he might let it be; Yingyue Hall had suffered heavy losses this time and Wei Guchang didn't want to wade into more trouble. He had planned to send his three junior disciples back to the Second Layer while he and Xuan'er wandered the Third Layer to see if any opportunities awaited. But if the Red Candle Fruit truly had such miraculous effects, then even at the cost of life they had to seize it!

And they must seize it no matter what!

If such a thing fell into an enemy's hands it would be fatal for Yingyue Hall; Wei Guchang could not stand idly by.

"Senior Brother..." Xuan'er bit her lip and looked at Wei Guchang with worry in her beautiful eyes.

Wei Guchang's face shifted, then he made up his mind. He told the three juniors, "You return to the Second Layer. Do not meddle in the matter of the Red Candle Fruit — it will be chaotic out there!"

"Then what about you, Senior Brother Wei?" asked the tall woman.

"Xuan'er and I will go." Wei Guchang glanced at Daiyuan. Daiyuan smiled softly, "Such a rare event I would naturally go see. Besides, it still has some days before it fully ripens; I can use its fragrance to refine and merge my cultivation in the meantime."

Wei Guchang seemed to have expected her reply; he nodded and then cast his gaze toward Yang Kai, asking, "What do you intend, Brother Yang?"

"I'll go take a look as well," Yang Kai said calmly.

"Fine, then let's go!" Wei Guchang no longer hesitated; after a day of recovery he had nearly restored himself and by the time they arrived he would be close to peak — he would not fear a fight.

The four rushed off together, speeding toward the Red Candle Fruit.

Along the way, Yang Kai cast Daiyuan a thoughtful glance and said with a faint smile, “Miss Daiyuan, you seem quite well-versed in the study of herbs and medicine?”

If she had not long immersed herself among herbs she could not so swiftly identify the Red Candle Fruit. From Daiyuan's demeanor it was clear she had read widely and studied rare, hard-to-find spiritual herbs and fruits.

Hearing Yang Kai, Wei Guchang laughed loudly, "You probably don't know, Brother Yang — Miss Daiyuan not only has impressive power, she is also a Saint King-Grade alchemist."

"Oh?" Yang Kai was surprised; he had not expected Daiyuan to be a fellow alchemist. He was an Origin-Grade alchemist, while she was only a Saint King-Grade — a considerable gap.

Daiyuan said lightly, "Only a Lower-Level Saint King-Grade alchemist, nothing special. My aptitude in alchemy isn't that great. Brother Yang, there must be many Origin-Grade alchemists and Void King-Grade alchemists outside, right?"

Yang Kai chuckled, knowing she had likely asked Xuan'er about him. He shook his head slowly, "There are indeed many Origin-Grade alchemists, but Void King-Grade alchemists... are rare. I haven't encountered one."

"So Void King-Grade alchemists are rare outside as well," Daiyuan said with surprise.

"Naturally. Void King-Grade experts are few outside as well."

Daiyuan opened her mouth as if to ask something, then hesitated and said nothing. Yang Kai frowned slightly — since she didn't press, he saw no need to pry and risk unnecessary trouble.

The journey of hundreds of li that lay between them would normally take the four only a moment, but within Flowing Flame Sandland such a distance still consumed considerable time.

Yet the farther they went the stronger the fruit scent that permeated heaven and earth became, and the red sun rising over there had climbed much higher, already tens of zhang into the air.

“We need to pick up the pace,” Daiyuan urged softly. “When the Red Candle Fruit ripens, a rare phenomenon called ‘Three Suns Rising’ will appear. Only then will it be truly mature. Every moment before that is precious—if we arrive early, we’ll be able to gain its benefits sooner.”
