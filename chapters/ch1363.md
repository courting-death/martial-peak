## Chapter 1363 — Who Can Wield It?

Three ancient characters were carved on that pitch-black staff, strange and archaic; Yang Kai had no idea what they meant. The moment Yang Yan mentioned the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, he immediately made the connection.

Yang Yan glanced at him, a faint snort escaping her jade nose, unconcerned: "What's so strange about knowing them? By the way, was the Formation Talisman you were refining also taken from the Imperial Garden?"

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded instinctively, his eyes continuously studying Yang Yan.

Feeling his odd stare, Yang Yan gave a soft laugh. "What, do you think I would change somehow?"

"It's not that, it's just—though I know you are learned and knowledgeable, I didn't expect you to recognize even this sort of ancient script."

"It's not really ancient script, just something from tens of thousands of years ago. The Dark Star experienced a great upheaval once; these characters were lost afterward. This Heaven-Shaking Pillar is a fine thing—it's entirely forged from Heaven-Crystal Darksteel. Quite an extravagant piece."

"Heaven-Crystal Darksteel?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, incredulous.

Although he wasn't skilled at forging, he had heard of rare materials: Heaven-Crystal Darksteel was exceedingly precious, a top-tier material of Void King-Grade. Rumor said a slab the size of a palm could weigh ten thousand jin, and it was extraordinarily hard—few things in the world could break it.

Adding a little of it during forging could raise a Secret Treasure's strength; in fights it was a major advantage.

And Yang Yan actually said the entire Heaven-Shaking Pillar was made from Heaven-Crystal Darksteel! That was almost impossible to believe.

Yet that would explain why it possessed such bizarre weight.

"It must have been dangerous to obtain?" Yang Yan asked with concern.

Yang Kai chuckled and briefly recounted his battle with that puppet. After hearing it, Yang Yan nodded slightly. "Your choice was good. That puppet is valuable, but it pales before this Heaven-Shaking Pillar. You got the better deal; only a puppet like that could possibly wield a Secret Treasure of this sort."

"Want it? I'll give it to you; I have no use for it. If you melt it down, you could likely forge many Secret Treasures." An idea flickered in Yang Kai's mind—his original reason for choosing the black greatstaff had been its material.

“Melt it down?” Yang Yan curled her lips. “Why would I melt it? Even I can’t forge a Secret Treasure like this right now—there are countless astonishing formations inscribed within it. Melting it would be far too wasteful. If I can find someone suitable to use it, then…”

"Who could possibly wield it?" Yang Kai laughed loudly. "Unless you also forge a puppet like that, it's impossible."

"There is someone who can wield it!" Yang Yan smiled mysteriously.

“Who?” Yang Kai’s face twitched slightly. He couldn’t believe that on all of Dark Star, there could be anyone strong enough to wield the Heaven-Shaking Pillar. That would be beyond human limits. Even a Third-Stage Origin Returning Realm expert would likely exhaust their Saint Yuan in no time if they tried to use this Secret Treasure.

“That one!” Yang Yan pointed with her hand. Following the direction of her finger, Yang Kai saw the Stone Puppet off to the side, sneakily peeking in their direction.

When Yang Kai and Yang Yan fixed their gaze on it together, the Stone Puppet stopped hiding. Using both hands and feet, like a stone monkey, it sprinted over, leaping to Yang Kai's feet. Its round eyes bulged as it stared up at him.

"The Stone Puppet can?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Try and see," Yang Yan said with a smile, pursing her lips. She pointed at the Heaven-Shaking Pillar and called: "Xiaoxiao!"

Hearing its name, the Stone Puppet glanced at Yang Yan, then at Yang Kai; after getting his permission it approached the short Heaven-Shaking Pillar and began to walk around it.

Before long, a look of delight and excitement appeared in the Stone Puppet’s eyes. Its hunched back straightened, and it pounded its chest a few times with force before reaching out to grab the Heaven-Shaking Pillar.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed—he watched without blinking.

He saw, clearly, the Heaven-Shaking Pillar that had defeated him rendered weightless in the Stone Puppet's grasp. The chi-long rod seemed devoid of weight. The Stone Puppet treated it like a new toy, beaming, its mouth splitting into a grin as its hands seized the middle of the pillar and swung; the pillar unfurled into a curtain of strikes.

Whoosh...

A fierce wind howled; the chamber's Spiritual Qi was thrown into chaos. At the puppet's location a tornado formed in the blink of an eye, and in the next moment the surrounding seals flared with light as if repelling an invisible assault.

Yang Kai simultaneously felt invisible wind-blades slicing at his body, producing sizzling sounds.

This...

Yang Kai stared, dumbfounded!

Even when that puppet had wielded the greatstaff in the Imperial Garden, it had not done so with such smoothness. Xiaoxiao concealed an enormous power within its small form that was hard to credit.

Yang Kai suddenly realized that the Stone Puppet wasn’t as simple as he had imagined—it wasn’t merely something an artificer could use for tempering materials. It seemed to possess far greater potential waiting to be unearthed!

The last time in the Corpse Den the Stone Puppet had suddenly grown larger and swallowed the Sun's True Essence in one gulp, preserving it inside for a long while. Without it, Yang Kai could not have carried the Sun's True Essence away.

This little creature was truly full of surprises.

"Enough, enough!" Laughter crinkled Yang Yan's eyes as she waved at the Stone Puppet. "Go play outside. If you keep this up you'll break the seals here; I'll have to repair them, and that's troublesome."

Obeying, the Stone Puppet stopped its motions. The tornado it had produced vanished. Then it opened its mouth wide, swallowed the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, shifted its posture, and disappeared into the earth.

When Yang Kai later sensed it again, the Stone Puppet had already appeared somewhere more than ten li away.

Discovering the Stone Puppet's potential thrilled Yang Kai. The reason was simple: in his Black Book Space there was another Stone Puppet embryo—if only he could find a Blood Essence Stone, he could bring it to life.

Over the years the Stone Puppet embryo had remained alive and showed no signs of dying in the womb.

"This is your shield. Be more careful with it next time. Though I can repair it once or twice, at this rate it won't survive many more repairs," Yang Yan said as she handed over a purple shield.

Yang Yan wasn't worried about the shield so much as she was about Yang Kai himself—an Origin-Grade Upper-Level shield damaged so severely hinted at how perilous his encounter had been.

Yang Kai understood and didn't argue. He accepted the shield, silently examined it, and found it restored to perfection. Pleased, he stowed it away.

"Show me your Formation Talisman again." Yang Yan extended an elegant hand toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai didn't hesitate. He produced the Formation Talisman and handed it to her.

Yang Yan studied the talisman, turning it over and probing it for a while, then tossed it back to Yang Kai: "This is the Formation Talisman of the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation—its power is considerable. I'll teach you the formation's variations so you can comprehend them yourself; that way, in future battles you can exploit the talisman's strength to the fullest."

Yang Kai was slightly moved. Yang Yan truly was an authority on formations—she recognized the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation from a single glance. No other Formation Master could have identified it so easily.

Even if her tone was lofty, Yang Kai harbored no doubt.

As she spoke, Yang Yan extended a finger. A white orb swirled at its tip and touched Yang Kai's forehead.

Yang Kai stayed still and allowed it. After a moment his body trembled as a rush of information poured into his mind. A brief probe revealed a wealth of exquisite descriptions of the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation. Overjoyed, he had been planning to ask Yang Yan about the formation anyway; her voluntary instruction saved him the trouble.

But after using that method, Yang Yan's face looked a bit pale—she seemed greatly drained.

“All right, take your time to comprehend it properly. Things outside are a complete mess right now—countless cultivators are coming and going, and there’s no shortage of powerful ones among them. We’ve sealed off Dragon Lair Mountain just as you instructed, so it’s the perfect time to focus on our own matters. Oh, right—I’ll bring some materials over in a few days; help me refine them then.”

"Got it." Yang Kai nodded. As she turned to leave, he hesitated and suddenly called out, "Yang Yan!"

"Yes?"

"Don't you have something to tell me?" Yang Kai looked at her with an enigmatic half-smile.

"Not now. I'll tell you when the time comes!" Yang Yan glared, half-pleased and half-annoyed, twisted her waist, opened the seal, and left.

Watching her disappear, Yang Kai smiled faintly. No matter what changes had come to Yang Yan, she bore him no malice. She still treated him as a friend, which was what he wanted to see. As for her secrets and other matters, Yang Kai didn't feel compelled to pry.

Shaking his head, he resumed comprehending the wondrous variations of the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation.

In less than two hours, Yang Kai had already grasped the intricacies of this formation. What remained was simply adapting to its variations in actual combat. Only at this point did a faint sense of lingering fear rise in his heart.

The Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation is one of the ancient strange formations. Merely setting it up is arduous; it requires refining heavenly clouds—such a method is terrifying. As an ancient strange formation, of course it could not be limited to the small effect Yang Kai had witnessed.

Back in the Imperial Garden the formation lacked a master and only displayed a fragment of its power, which is why Yang Kai and the others were able to break it and seize the advantage.

Although Yang Kai's formation skill and strength couldn't unleash the formation's full might, he could still apply thirty to forty percent of it, which would significantly boost his own power. Unless facing experts like Qian Tong or Fei Zhi Tu, Yang Kai believed he could handle most opponents. Naturally, whether he could kill an enemy depended on their strength and methods.

Under normal circumstances, even a Second Stage Origin Returning Realm expert falling into it would be doomed without a doubt.
