## Chapter 2335 — Obstinate to the End

Seeing no one respond around him, Ye Hen said indifferently, “Luo Jin’s conduct is disgraceful. Friends, do you really wish to associate with such a person?”

Anger flared in his heart, and he no longer bothered with courtesy toward Luo Jin, calling him by name directly.

At those words, the burly, broad-shouldered man snorted coldly and said, "Let's set aside City Lord Luo's affairs. I want to ask: what grudge does that brat surnamed Yang have with our Deputy Hall Master Ke Tian that he would kill him in the City Lord's mansion?"

By his tone, it was Hall Master Ruan Hongbo of Heavenly Extreme Hall.

Like Ye Hen, Ruan Hongbo was also at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Now that his own Deputy Hall Master had been killed by Yang Kai, he naturally could not let it go. So, despite his disdain for Luo Jin’s character, he still came along to seek justice.

As soon as Ruan Hongbo finished, another person chimed in, “That scoundrel also killed my son Mu Zheng. I, Mu Guan, will never share the same sky with him!”

Ye Hen turned his head and saw that the speaker was Mu Guan, Tower Master of White Cloud Tower.

Regarding what happened that day in the City Lord’s mansion, Ye Hen had already questioned Ye Qinghan in detail. He knew that Mu Zheng was indeed killed by Yang Kai, who even used his flesh and blood to write a large ‘death’ character on the wall, intimidating all the guests.

But to speak plainly, Mu Zheng brought this upon himself. He had no ability yet insisted on standing out, and after being killed by Yang Kai as a warning, who could he blame? Still, White Cloud Tower clearly would not let the matter rest.

“That brat injured my Heart Inquiry Pavilion disciple. As Pavilion Master, I am here to demand a reasonable explanation.” The Pavilion Master of Heart Inquiry Pavilion also stepped forward.

“It’s the same for my Soul Seizing Sword Sect. Sect Master Ye, hand him over, so we can all save face.”

As one Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert after another stood up, the faces of Chiyue Sect’s upper echelon gradually changed, though Ye Hen remained calm. He turned to the blue-haired man sitting on the sedan and said, “Is that also Palace Master Qiu’s intention?”

Of everyone present, he did not fear most, but the one he feared was this blue-haired man—Qiu Ze, Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace, whose strength had reached the peak of the Dao Origin Realm. Rumor had it that for over a decade, he had been in seclusion, comprehending the mysteries of the Emperor Realm, hoping to break through and ascend to the imperial rank.

For all these years, there had been no news of him leaving seclusion, yet today, unexpectedly, he had come to the gates of Chiyue Sect.

Ye Hen dared not take him lightly, for he had a great chance of advancing to the Emperor Realm. Once he did, no one within a million li would be his match.

Qiu Ze smiled slightly and said, “My son Qiu Yu’s skills are lacking. He suffered a heavy loss at the hands of that brat surnamed Yang. This Lord is here to invite him to Tianzhao Palace for a few days, and perhaps teach Qiu Yu a thing or two about cultivation. They’re both young, so they should have some common ground. Sect Master Ye, I hope you won’t refuse.”

His words sounded pleasant, but everyone knew it was just an excuse.

Qiu Yu had indeed been seriously injured by Yang Kai in the City Lord’s mansion that day. But if that were all, would it really require Qiu Ze to come in person? Tianzhao Palace and Chiyue Sect had long-standing grudges. One was a newly risen sect with hopes of ruling the region, the other an old declining power. If the former wanted to establish authority, it was only natural to start with the latter.

As long as Chiyue Sect could be eliminated, Tianzhao Palace’s prestige would be unmatched. At that point, Qiu Ze would be the overlord of this land.

“Hand him over!”

“Sect Master Ye, we have no enmity with Chiyue Sect and do not wish to make things difficult for you, but that brat surnamed Yang cannot be let off lightly. Please, Sect Master Ye, do not shield him!”

The leaders of several sects all began clamoring, pressuring Chiyue Sect.

Ye Hen’s brow furrowed, and the upper echelon of Chiyue Sect who had come with him looked even more alarmed, their hearts filled with unease.

Although the sect-protecting grand array stood between them, and these people likely could do nothing to them for now, Chiyue Sect’s disciples would eventually have to go out. They could not hide behind the array forever. If they offended so many forces here, how could Chiyue Sect survive in the future?

At this thought, several of Chiyue Sect’s upper echelon all looked toward Ye Hen.

They did not know what relationship Yang Kai had with Ye Hen, nor why, after causing such a huge mess, he would hide in Chiyue Sect, bringing disaster to the sect. Nor did they understand why Ye Hen, knowing all this, would still take him in!

This was clearly not a wise move.

“Sect Master…” An old man at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm called out softly. Though he said nothing more, his meaning was clear.

Yang Kai had nothing to do with Chiyue Sect. It would be better to show weakness here and hand him over in exchange for peace, rather than have the sect’s gates blocked like this.

Ye Hen glanced at the old man and said calmly, “I know what I’m doing.”

Hearing this, the old man sighed heavily and said no more. He was of the older generation in Chiyue Sect and had watched Ye Hen grow up. He knew Ye Hen’s temperament well and trusted that he would not act recklessly. So, though he was deeply worried, he chose to believe Ye Hen would not harm the sect.

“Sect Master!” Suddenly, Chiyue Sect’s Vice Sect Master Shi Cangying stepped forward, cupped his fists, and said in a deep voice, “I believe our friends are right. That brat surnamed Yang has no respect for rank, dared to act recklessly in the City Lord’s mansion, and even killed a man as esteemed as Ke Tian. He is clearly a bloodthirsty killer. No matter his previous motives, his coming to Chiyue Sect cannot be for any good. I ask Sect Master to hand him over to our friends, lest people say we are colluding with him and ruin our reputation.”

Qiu Ze smiled and said, “Deputy Hall Master Shi is truly sensible. Very good, very good!”

Shi Cangying smiled and said, “Heaven watches all. I am merely following the will of Heaven, Palace Master Qiu flatters me.”

Ye Hen said coldly, “Brother Shi, I have already said, Young Master Yang is an honored guest of Chiyue Sect. No one is to target him. If you still consider me Sect Master, do not speak of this again.”

Shi Cangying’s expression changed slightly. “Sect Master, are you really going to disregard the foundation built over tens of thousands of years by our ancestors?”

Ye Hen replied, “It is precisely because I care for our foundation that Young Master Yang cannot be handed over to anyone.”

Only Ye Qinghan knew about Yang Kai repairing the secret realm entrance. Ye Hen had not told anyone else, so Shi Cangying did not know why Ye Hen was so determined to protect Yang Kai.

Seeing his resolute expression, as if he would turn hostile at another word, Shi Cangying’s heart skipped a beat. In his memory, Ye Hen had never been so forceful. Because of his age and stagnant cultivation, Ye Hen had always been polite to him. Normally, no matter what he said, Ye Hen would consider it carefully, and even if he disagreed, he would not be so harsh. Why was he so adamant when it came to that brat surnamed Yang?

Instinctively, Shi Cangying felt something was off, but he had no time to ponder. His face darkened as he said, “Sect Master, are you really going to be so obstinate, plunging the sect into disaster? Have you considered the feelings and future of the three thousand disciples? One wrong decision from you could doom the sect forever! As Vice Sect Master, I have a responsibility and duty to consider the sect and its disciples.”

Ye Hen retorted coldly, “Are you thinking of the sect, or yourself?”

Before Shi Cangying could reply, Ye Hen shouted sternly, “My mind is made up. Stand down!”

Shi Cangying was stunned, instinctively shivering, as if only now remembering that the other was the Sect Master, and he was merely the Vice Sect Master.

Outside the Protective Mountain Array, a group of experts watched coldly, sneering in their hearts. Rumor had it that Chiyue Sect was unstable within, and there was much discord between Ye Hen and Shi Cangying. Now it seemed to be true. These two were the pillars of Chiyue Sect, yet at such a time, they were fighting among themselves. It showed just how rotten the sect had become.

Such a sect probably would not last much longer.

At this thought, everyone sneered inwardly, as if already seeing the destruction of Chiyue Sect.

Under everyone’s gaze, Shi Cangying, having been rebuked by Ye Hen, could not save face and, in his shame and anger, said, “Fine! Since Sect Master will not listen to reason and insists on being obstinate, disregarding the sect’s safety, don’t blame me for no longer treating you as Sect Master.”

Ye Hen was slightly startled and shouted coldly, “What are you trying to do?”

Shi Cangying smiled and said, “That brat surnamed Yang has brought disaster to the sect by offending so many sects, yet hides within Chiyue Sect. For the sake of the disciples, I will hand him over. Sect Master, rest assured, this has nothing to do with you. Even if someone blames us in the future, I alone will bear the responsibility and will not tarnish your good name!”

With his righteous air, claiming he would bear the blame for the sect, Shi Cangying immediately won the favor of many in Chiyue Sect’s upper echelon, who felt Ye Hen was indeed being too autocratic.

Suddenly, Ye Hen seemed to realize something and exclaimed, “You dare send people to seize them?”

Only now did Ye Hen notice that the three trusted elders who always followed Shi Cangying were missing. All three were at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. With such strength, Yang Kai’s friends would be unable to resist.

The people Yang Kai brought were only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Although their rooms had restrictions, those elders were intimately familiar with them and could break them with ease.

At this, Ye Hen was utterly shocked and wished he could kill Shi Cangying with a single palm.

His daughter had gone through great trouble to invite Yang Kai to Chiyue Sect to repair the secret realm entrance, yet the Vice Sect Master was now targeting Yang Kai’s friends. If Yang Kai found out, how could he explain?

He had already decided that, even if it meant offending so many sects this time, as long as Yang Kai could repair the entrance and restore Chiyue Sect’s techniques and secret arts, it would be worth it.

At worst, Chiyue Sect could seal its gates for a few years, letting its experts study those techniques and secret arts. As long as they could mobilize the more than thirty Dao Origin-Grade puppets in the square, Chiyue Sect would have nothing to fear from any sect and could catch its breath. With time, would they not be able to drive even the Heaven-Grade puppets?
