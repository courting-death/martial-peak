## Chapter 33 — Yang Source Seal

But the True Yang Technique is different. When reaching its limit, the True Yang Primordial Qi transforms into liquid and sinks into the Dantian, effectively clearing the meridians and allowing cultivation to continue. In other words, practicing this technique never truly hits a dead end. As long as there is Yang Qi, one can cultivate without restriction.

This is the second distinction, one that further highlights the extraordinary nature of the True Yang Technique.

Once Yang Liquid is cultivated, it can be used offensively in battle.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before deciding to cultivate this True Yang Technique.

Firstly, he had no choice—without Contribution Points, he could not obtain martial skills from the sect. Secondly, he trusted that anything produced by the Wordless Black Book would not be inferior. The martial arts within the sect were not necessarily better than the True Yang Technique.

As for the cultivation environment, it was not something to worry about. The sun itself embodies Yang; as long as there was sunlight, the True Yang Technique could be cultivated, albeit at a very low efficiency.

After all, the sun shines upon the earth and illuminates the universe, but how much could a single person absorb?

With his decision made, Yang Kai immediately stepped outside, placing himself under the sun’s rays. He sat cross-legged on the ground, closed his eyes, and focused on the circulation path of the True Yang Technique, striving to control the faint Primordial Qi in his Dantian and guide it according to the technique’s prescribed route.

The beginning is always the hardest—this saying held true. Although Yang Kai could communicate with that slender thread of Primordial Qi, coaxing it into motion was an arduous task.

After a full day of cultivation under the scorching sun, the Primordial Qi within him increased only slightly, and its flow was as slow as a crawling turtle. But since it was his first attempt, Yang Kai was already quite satisfied with this progress.

Cultivation was a process of accumulation over time, not something achieved overnight. Patience was a virtue Yang Kai had never lacked.

After three days of effort, Yang Kai finally managed to draw the Primordial Qi from his Dantian up to his chest. With a focused mind, he controlled this modest Primordial Qi to shuttle through several vital acupoints near his chest.

He was following the information gleaned from the Wordless Black Book to form the Yang Source Seal within his body—the first step in cultivating the True Yang Technique.

This Yang Source Seal had no other purpose than to sense the presence of Yang Qi. Yang Kai’s experience was shallow, and his strength too weak; he had yet to form his own Divine Sense and could not detect where Yang Qi was concentrated on a large scale.

But with the Yang Source Seal, things were different. It was highly sensitive to Yang Qi; as long as Yang Qi existed within a certain range, the seal would respond.

The slender thread of Primordial Qi darted ceaselessly near his chest, Yang Kai’s expression serious and unyielding, not daring to be careless. Forming the Yang Source Seal was a complex and tedious process; any mistake along the way could cause all previous efforts to be wasted.

An hour passed, then two. Sitting beneath the sun, Yang Kai was soaked in sweat. The prolonged exertion had even caused signs of dehydration; his lips had turned pale. Yet his expression remained resolute, continuously guiding the Primordial Qi to circulate through the vital points without a trace of impatience or discouragement.

How long had passed, he could not say, when suddenly a strange sensation arose in his chest. It was followed by a sharp pain in the flesh, as if a red-hot branding iron had seared him.

Yang Kai abruptly opened his eyes, gritting his teeth to endure.

The pain came swiftly and left just as fast. In the blink of an eye, the chest returned to normal, even feeling somewhat cool. Yet the memory of that intense pain lingered in his mind, stirring unease.

Faintly, Yang Kai sensed something new within his chest, but when he looked down, there was nothing visible.

Had the Yang Source Seal formed? Yang Kai furrowed his brow and pondered. It should have succeeded—it existed at the very center of his chest, though invisible to the eye.

But if the Yang Source Seal had formed, it should respond to Yang Qi. Why then could he not detect any reaction?

Could it be that there was no concentrated Yang Qi nearby?

With a tentative thought, Yang Kai stood and walked into the depths of Lingxiao Pavilion, carefully observing any changes near his chest.

After a short distance, a sudden warmth radiated from his chest, and Yang Kai’s expression shifted sharply.

Indeed, the Yang Source Seal had formed within him. The lack of earlier response was due to the absence of nearby Yang Qi. Now that it reacted, it meant Yang Qi was present in the vicinity.

Excitement filled Yang Kai’s face. The True Yang Technique demanded a strict cultivation environment—the denser the Yang Qi, the faster the cultivation. Relying solely on sunlight, as Yang Kai did, was undoubtedly the slowest method.

Following the direction indicated by the Yang Source Seal, Yang Kai sprinted forward, soon bursting into a room.

Just as he entered, a familiar voice called out, “Ah, Xiao Yang Kai, what brings you here at this hour?”

Looking up, Yang Kai saw Shopkeeper Meng behind the counter, eyeing him curiously.

This was the Contribution Hall!

Glancing at Shopkeeper Meng and then at the back room behind the Contribution Hall, Yang Kai rolled his eyes. The source of the Yang Qi was clear—it must be something Yang in nature stored in the Contribution Hall’s warehouse.

But... that was the Contribution Hall’s property. If he wanted it, he would have to exchange Contribution Points for it. Yang Kai’s Contribution Points balance was zero; all had been spent on Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs.

Realizing this, Yang Kai was deeply disappointed. He didn’t even bother responding to Shopkeeper Meng’s question, turning away with a heavy heart.

“What do you mean by that?” the old shopkeeper muttered, feeling dejected.

Yang Kai wandered aimlessly through Lingxiao Pavilion. The Yang Source Seal in his chest occasionally activated, guiding him toward sources of Yang Qi. Yet these sources were either the residences of sect leaders or already in others’ possession.

Yang Kai even entertained the thought of a masked robbery, but after sizing up his own frail frame against the strength of others, he discarded the idea.

Though he could not obtain these Yang-attributed treasures, Yang Kai was not without gains. Through repeated experiments and observations, he found that the Yang Source Seal could clearly sense Yang Qi within a radius of fifty zhang.

Beyond fifty zhang, the seal’s sensitivity faded. This was likely linked to his current strength. In time, as his power grew, the Yang Source Seal’s sensing range should expand.

After two or three hours of wandering through Lingxiao Pavilion—excluding some forbidden areas—Yang Kai had nearly traversed the entire place, yet found nothing. It was no surprise; if these treasures were detectable by the Yang Source Seal, they must be valuable and would not be casually discarded in the open for him to find. His earlier thoughts now seemed naive and laughable.

Should he make another trip to Black Wind Mountain? Surely, the mountain range would harbor Yang-attributed items.

As he pondered this, the Yang Source Seal in his chest suddenly warmed again. Instinctively, Yang Kai followed the direction indicated and strode purposefully onward.
