## Chapter 1408 — Heroic Youth

Every Secret Treasure belonging to Chang Qi and Hao An, whether offensive or defensive, was Origin-Grade Upper-Level, and the pills they took were so fine they made Ning Xiangchen ache with envy.

Poor him, drifting through life — the best Secret Treasure he owned was only Origin-Grade Lower-Level, and he had to go about seeking materials to mend it.

Just now Chang Qi gave him several restorative spiritual pills; he hadn’t dared to take them yet and had quietly kept them.

The very thought that he could one day possess such things made Ning Xiangchen all the more certain his choice had been right.

Laughter and merriment continued over here, but Yang Kai suddenly frowned, and the joyous expression on his face once more sank.

Chang Qi watched his expression and asked puzzled, “What is it now?”

“Many honored guests have come to visit. A few of you, come with me and take a look.” Yang Kai sneered.

“Honored guests?” Chang Qi and the others exchanged glances, though they soon guessed what was happening. Their brows tightened as they followed Yang Kai outside.

The dense mist covering Dragon Lair Mountain rolled and parted again, revealing a passage that led straight into the heart of the mountain; moments later Yang Kai and the four others emerged there.

In an instant countless eyes turned to size up the four of them. When they saw Yang Kai and the others were unscathed, every face showed shock, then astonishment, suspicion, incredulity, and awe.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu raised an eyebrow, their reactions unlike the others’. They secretly relaxed and discreetly nodded to Yang Kai — a silent greeting.

“What a grand display!” Ning Xiangchen stood behind Yang Kai, swept his gaze around, and exclaimed in astonishment.

Outside the Protective Mountain Array of Dragon Lair Mountain, numerous experts had gathered, hovering here and there in small groups, all peering curiously toward the interior. Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu need not be mentioned; Ning Xiangchen also spotted Mo Xiaosheng of the Battle Sky Alliance, Cheng Pengxuan of Leitai Sect, Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect. Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain and Gong Aofu of Liuli Sect were present; besides them there were members from Li Huo Sect and Qiantian Sect, and forces from Shuangxin Valley and Sea Hall. Even Yan Pei and Ren Tianrui, the black-faced master and disciple from Jubao Tower, stood among them.

Each party brought disciples and formed a semicircle around Dragon Lair Mountain, every contingent exuding an intimidating aura that made one’s heart tremble.

There were a dozen or two top experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm alone, and countless others at the Second and First Stages.

Dragon Lair Mountain seemed to have suddenly become a prize everyone coveted.

Ning Xiangchen drew a cold breath and felt panic growing within him.

Not to mention the strength of these arriving experts themselves, their sect backing alone encompassed the majority of first-rank sects across Dark Star.

Especially when Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng looked at Yang Kai, their gazes seemed ready to burst into flames; anyone could see the towering fury in their eyes.

After all, many from their sects had taken part in the assault on Dragon Lair Mountain this time, especially figures like Elder Du and that middle-aged man at the Second Stage. Now Yang Kai stood before them unharmed while they had gone missing — it was not hard to imagine their fate.

But could Dragon Lair Mountain truly be that capable, slaying every intruder who dared enter?

Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng were not the only ones suspicious; everyone pondered the same question. Yet if those intruders had not perished, why would Yang Kai dare appear here?

What actually happened inside while the Protective Mountain Array was shut down? Everyone was baffled. Though all who had come were powerful, none again dared to underestimate Dragon Lair Mountain; when they looked at the array and the layers of restrictions inside, all wore burning expressions.

No other reason — the mysteries of those arrays and formations were limitless. If they could find and capture the array’s master and bring them back, their sect’s central array techniques would surely gain great improvement.

“Junior Yang Kai pays respects to the elders!” Yang Kai called out loudly, neither humble nor arrogant. “I beg your pardon for failing to welcome you properly; please excuse any discourtesy.”

The experts from the various powers shifted their expressions but no one answered. Before this, few had any ties with Dragon Lair Mountain or Yang Kai — most came from curiosity, and some to gather news.

As for Yang Kai, a mere Saint King Realm cultivator, they had not yet taken him seriously.

Only Qian Tong laughed heartily and said, “Don’t worry about it. We old fellows are just bored with nothing to do, so we came to have a look.”

Qian Tong’s remark swept at the assembled company, earning him many scowls from the other experts.

“Oh… is that so.” Yang Kai grinned, replying lightly, “Then you might leave disappointed. Dragon Lair Mountain is small, sparsely populated, and the scenery isn’t much to see.”

Such an obvious dismissal — even a deaf man could hear it. Yang Kai might as well have told them to go back the way they came.

But now that so many experts had come, they would not simply leave without getting answers. The others did not care much, but Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng certainly would not let it drop. With that in mind most eyes turned toward Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng, waiting to see how they would reply.

At this point, Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng naturally could not sit out of it. Jin Shi snorted coldly and, staring sternly at Yang Kai, demanded impatiently, “Boy, I’ll ask you — where did those who entered the mountain go?”

“Ah, Elder Jin!” Yang Kai acted as if he had just noticed him, wearing a respectful expression while his tone remained casual. “You mean that group from the Xie Family?”

Jin Shi cleared his throat. “Yes. I’m asking about the people of the Xie Family. Where are they now?”

Although it was known that people from the Demon Blood Sect had joined this action, Jin Shi would not be so foolish as to admit it. Outwardly, this assault on Dragon Lair Mountain appeared to be a feud between the Xie Family and Yang Kai; the attackers were all disciples of the Xie Family, no others.

“If you’re asking after the Xie Family, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.” Yang Kai’s mouth curled.

“What do you mean by that?” Jin Shi felt his heart skip.

“Heh, Elder Jin, why ask what you already know? Those people dared to barge into my Dragon Lair Mountain and plotted harm against me. Naturally I sent them to the Yellow Springs. I am not a man of a gentle temper.” Yang Kai’s expression progressively chilled.

A sharp inhalation rang out and everyone’s faces turned to extreme shock.

Although many had suspected the intruders’ prospects were grim, to have Yang Kai himself confirm it was still hard to believe.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu nearly popped their eyes out; the rest of the experts wore equally stunned expressions, as if seeing a ghost in daylight.

Among those intruders had been more than thirty Origin Returning Realm cultivators, including three at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and two hundred at the Saint King Realm. Such a force thrown into the little Dragon Lair Mountain — how could they have been annihilated?

How was that possible?

Could Dragon Lair Mountain possess such power? If so, this little hill might already rank among second-tier powers.

“Utter nonsense—just with the likes of you?” Old Woman Feng had never been one for patience. Seeing Yang Kai’s rampant arrogance, a trace of fury flashed across her aged face. She slammed her dragon-headed cane hard into the void, clearly unwilling to believe Yang Kai’s words, instinctively assuming that he must have used some formation to trap those who had entered.

“Senior Feng does not believe it?” Yang Kai glanced at her sideways.

“Ignorant child — I’ve lived most of my life and never heard such a fine joke.” Old Woman Feng’s face changed wildly as she noticed Yang Kai casually playing with a single-handed axe that had suddenly appeared in his hand.

“Grandmother, that is…” The young woman Feng Yan, standing beside Old Woman Feng, also paled, for she recognized the single-handed axe as the Secret Treasure of Elder Du — an Origin-Grade Middle-Level treasure he cherished above all else and rarely revealed. Unless Elder Du had perished, how could such a treasure have fallen into Yang Kai’s hands?

It therefore seemed that Elder Du truly had perished!

With a Second Stage Origin Returning cultivator dead, the others surely could not have survived either.

Old Woman Feng could no longer question matters; the facts lay plainly before her and to deny them would be self-deception.

Yang Kai sneered and said, “My Dragon Lair Mountain may be small, but it’s not a place just anyone can bully. Since all you Seniors are here today, this Junior dares to say one thing—if, in the future, any blind fools dare covet Dragon Lair Mountain, they will share the same fate as the Xie Family.”

“Boy, are you threatening us?” Jin Shi stepped forward and demanded fiercely.

“Old Ghost Jin!” Qian Tong gave a cold snort from the side. “Where did you hear any threat in Yang Kai’s words? He only said ‘blind fools.’ Don’t tell me your Demon Blood Sect intends to bully the weak with the strong and oppress those beneath you?”

Qian Tong instantly saw Jin Shi trying to seize the opportunity to escalate matters and would not give him the chance. Besides, Qian Tong had always stood with Dragon Lair Mountain; the current embarrassment of Yingyue Hall had filled him with anger, so now he seized the opportunity to retort and vent.

Hearing that, Jin Shi glanced at Qian Tong, frowned, and found it inconvenient to press the point further — after all, this was still Yingyue Hall’s territory and he had some reservations.

“Good, good!” Old Woman Feng ground her teeth and muttered, “Truly a hero emerges in youth — I underestimated you. You have great courage.”

Yang Kai grinned broadly. “Thanks for the praise, Senior Feng. Many say so, though I do not know how brave I truly am.”

Pfft…

A light laugh came from the side — Daiyuan of Liuli Sect had to stifle a chuckle and pressed her lips together.

Gong Aofu shot her a warning look.

Yin Sudie scowled, “Hmph, what’s to be so pleased about? This brat acts lawless and will get into trouble sooner or later. Senior Sister, you’d best not entangle yourself with him.”

“My affairs don’t need your concern. Junior Sister, just mind yourself.” Daiyuan replied coolly, her tone neither warm nor cold.
