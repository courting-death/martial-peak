## Chapter 735 — What Technique?

After witnessing Su Yan's unparalleled aptitude, Qian Yue gradually grew attached and wished to test her abilities. Unexpectedly, Su Yan mastered the Ice Sect's various Martial Skills and secret scriptures at a single learning.

Qian Yue was elated, believing she had found a treasure. From then on she began to instruct Su Yan with meticulous care, tending to her in every possible way. The Ice Sect's forbidden place, the Ice-Snow Cave, was even opened to her, allowing Su Yan to come and go to cultivate as she pleased.

After some time, Qian Yue proposed taking Su Yan as her disciple. To her surprise, Su Yan refused, which left Qian Yue somewhat disappointed.

Yet cherishing Su Yan's talent, Qian Yue did not reproach her and continued to look after her as before. Su Yan was likewise grateful; though she did not call Qian Yue "master," she still observed the proper etiquette of a junior.

"This girl's aptitude is unquestionable, and her physique is exceptionally pure. I can't tell what odd encounter she might have had, but she seems very close to the legendary Ice-Crystal Yu Body," Qian Yue said slowly, a trace of puzzlement on her face. "However, after carefully consulting several classics, I found that her physique is not the Ice-Crystal Yu Body."

Yang Kai snorted.

After all, he had given Su Yan so many Wan Yao Ling Ye and Wan Yao Ling Milk; it would be strange if long-term consumption had not altered her constitution.

"Moreover, I often see her lost in thought alone; at those times her face invariably wears a blissful smile," Qian Yue said coldly, casting Yang Kai a glance. "Her eyes also sometimes carry a look of fond remembrance."

Yang Kai inhaled through his nose.

Qing Ya, by his side, pursed her lips in a smile and furtively studied Yang Kai with some puzzlement, unsure what it was about this brat that had made Su Yan so smitten.

"Our Ice Sect disciples cultivate ice techniques and must keep a clear mind and few desires; only then can great achievement be made. This girl so often shows lovesick expressions — it's all your doing," Qian Yue said, anger flaring as she glared at Yang Kai, apparently convinced he had ruined Su Yan's future and prospects.

Yang Kai curled his lip and contemptuously retorted, "You old woman, how could you possibly understand the exquisite pleasures of a woman's love?"

"You..." Qian Yue trembled with fury, her pretty face paling. True Yuan surged; she looked as if she could not wait to slap Yang Kai dead to vent her hatred.

"Child, how can you speak like that?" Qing Ya chastised, glaring at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai, impatient, said, "Enough. Continue."

Qian Yue gritted her teeth; her breath rose and fell in agitation, and hatred flared in her lovely eyes. After a long while, under Qing Ya's soothing, she calmed and turned her head, saying, "I'm not in the mood. I won't say any more."

Yang Kai sneered and directed his questioning gaze at Qing Ya.

The Ice Lord sighed helplessly and spoke slowly, "Like I said. Originally Su Yan's aptitude was outstanding and her progress gratifying. Elder Qian Yue wished to accept her as a disciple; after being refused she did not press it, thinking with time and sincerity she could win the girl over, and that one day Su Yan would willingly join our Ice Sect as a disciple."

"But the good times did not last long," Qing Ya murmured, her brows knitting. "After a year here, Elder Qian Yue and I both discovered a problem with Su Yan."

"What problem?" Yang Kai asked urgently.

"It seems she does not cultivate only a single technique. Within her body another technique coexists alongside her original ice-based formulas," Qing Ya shook her head slowly. "If that other technique weren't present, Su Yan would have no risk simply cultivating the ice methods. But that unknown technique appears to impede the progress of her original methods, becoming a restraint."

"A restraint?"

"Yes. For now there is no immediate danger, but if this continues over time without proper guidance, Su Yan's strength may not advance and could even regress," Qing Ya said, looking at Yang Kai. "Since you are her Junior Brother and she is so infatuated with you, you should know what technique she cultivates, right?"

"I know," Yang Kai nodded.

"What technique?" both women asked at once.

"A dual cultivation technique," Yang Kai stated bluntly.

The two women flushed. Qian Yue spat a curse and said, "You bastard, you truly are the chief culprit who ruined Su Yan. If you hadn't defiled her purity so early, she wouldn't have achieved so little!"

"You know nothing!" Yang Kai sneered.

The woman seemed intent on placing all the blame on him, which greatly displeased Yang Kai.

From the time he met Su Yan until now, cultivating the Dual Cultivation Technique had not harmed her; on the contrary, it had advantages. The rapid progress both he and Su Yan had made could not have happened without the Dual Cultivation Technique.

"A dual cultivation technique?" Qing Ya's brow tightened. "Such a base technique — how could you practice it? Though dual cultivation can accelerate growth, generally foundations are unstable and it will eventually become a hidden danger on your path."

"What's base about love between a man and a woman? Your thinking is far too conservative," Yang Kai shot back, glancing at her. "Besides, Su Yan and I do not have unstable foundations, and you should be well aware of that."

Doubt clouded Qing Ya's expression.

Indeed, if they had truly practiced a crude dual cultivation method, Su Yan could not possibly possess the foundation and cultivation she currently had; by her level, any long-buried hazard should have already erupted.

Yet she remained so outstanding.

And this brat before them likewise — his being able to spar with an expert like Qian Yue while at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm was no small matter.

The only explanation was that the dual cultivation technique these two practiced must be of a very high level, not only harmless but possessing many wonderful effects.

Such techniques do exist in the world, but when most people hear "dual cultivation" they can't help but think ill of it, taking a prejudiced view that labels it heterodox and lowly.

"Putting that aside for now — after all, we have not personally seen any dual cultivation techniques, and cannot judge," Qing Ya, cheeks flushed, shifted the topic. "When Elder Qian Yue discovered the problem she hoped Su Yan would abolish that unknown technique and devote herself entirely to her ice practices. If she did so, another supreme technique of our Ice Sect could be taught to her; it would be all benefit, no harm."

"My Senior Sister refused, didn't she?" Yang Kai said coldly.

"Yes."

"Elder Qian and I didn't know why she refused so decisively, but now it seems that technique must be the link between you and her, which is why she wouldn't give it up," Qing Ya sighed softly. "This child is indeed a lovesick one."

"It's a pity some people don't deserve her!" Qian Yue sneered, her words barbed.

"If you dare nag again, I'll have two hundred of your Ice Sect disciples die this instant!" Yang Kai glared icily at Qian Yue. She ground her teeth and glared back with a feral expression as if she wanted to tear him limb from limb.

Qing Ya continued, "Elder Qian Yue advised her many times but she would not agree. In the end Elder Qian Yue attempted to forcefully abolish that technique, but Su Yan seemed to sense it. Before Elder Qian could act, Su Yan used Ice-Body Locking the Heart to seal herself in ice, leaving no chance for Elder Qian to intervene!"

Yang Kai let out a harsh laugh: "So you're saying my Senior Sister ended up like this entirely because of that woman?"

As he spoke, his True Yuan surged violently, and killing intent brimmed.

Qing Ya's face changed and she hurriedly said, "Don't fly into a rage. Although I also think Elder Qian's method was somewhat improper — acting without Su Yan's consent — she meant well. The Ice Sect's set of techniques is not something anyone can learn; she acted with good intentions but mistakenly injured Su Yan."

"What a tremendous kindness — let me thank you on behalf of my Senior Sister," Yang Kai ground his teeth and snorted coldly. His voice was icy, like a wind from a ninefold hell that sent chills down one's spine.

Qian Yue unexpectedly did not retort. Instead she appeared ashamed and angry, her eyes evasive and her expression pained.

Had she continued to whine, Yang Kai might truly have lost his temper and fought her here. Seeing her remorse, his killing intent eased considerably.

The woman was hateful indeed, yet she truly cared for Su Yan.

For that reason alone, Yang Kai saw no need to continue quarreling with her.

He drew a long breath to quell his raging anger and said slowly, "I understand how things transpired."

Qing Ya frowned and spoke softly, "Actually, this is not necessarily bad. Ice-Body Locking the Heart does not harm Su Yan; by maintaining that state she can rapidly increase her strength. When she awakens, her cultivation will have greatly risen."

"When will she awaken?" Yang Kai sneered. "Ten years? Twenty years? Or even longer?"

Qing Ya and Qian Yue fell silent.

Yang Kai's question was too difficult; they could not answer.

No Ice Sect disciple had ever performed Ice-Body Locking the Heart so completely. Su Yan had not considered whether she would be able to wake. If nothing is done, she might remain in that sleep forever.

"I've explained the situation to you. As for my Ice Sect's two hundred disciples..." Qing Ya inquired, "Rest assured, in my capacity as Ice Sect leader I guarantee that once those two hundred disciples are out of danger, no one here will trouble you further."

Yang Kai fixed her with a long gaze and gave a slight nod.

As Qing Ya and Qian Yue walked away, Yang Kai expanded his Divine Sense to cover a vast area and recalled all the released Soul Devouring Worms in accordance with that Divine Sense.

The two Ice Sect elders of Saint Realm who had been infected by those ancient strange worms, however, did not accept Yang Kai's aid; they retreated to their chambers to purge the infestation themselves.

They were confident they could, through their formidable cultivation and Divine Sense, kill the worms that had invaded their Sea of Consciousness and so declined Yang Kai's favor.

Qian Yue and the others carefully examined those disciples and, having confirmed they were not in mortal danger, finally relaxed.
