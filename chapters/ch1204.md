## Chapter 1204 — Third Layer

Yang Kai traveled on without incident; after leaving the plain he journeyed for another ten days or so and, strangely, did not encounter a single soul.

This abnormal occurrence left him deeply unsettled.

Previously, whether in the Heat-Flame Zone or the heaven-and-earth treasure area, although he had not met many people, it had at least never been like this — it was as if all the cultivators searching for Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine in the heaven-and-earth treasure area had suddenly disappeared, which set off alarm bells in Yang Kai's heart; he could not tell whether something untoward had happened here.

He wondered inwardly whether, during the days he had been mining Saint Crystal underground, some great event had occurred here, which was why he could not see a single person.

He pressed forward for several more days, and as he neared the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone the situation remained unchanged.

Half a day later Yang Kai reached the edge of the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone, eyes fixed on the fiery world before him, his face grave.

The Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone looked little different from the outermost Heat-Flame Zone, but Yang Kai could sense far more concealed peril within; at the very least the fire poison and the force of the heat here were not comparable to those of the outer zone.

However… it did not seem to be the kind of no-entry place Qian Tong had warned of. After probing with his senses for a while, Yang Kai felt that not only might he be able to enter, but other Sects' elites, provided they prepared sufficiently, should also be able to get in.

Could the danger be more than just what met the eye?

As Yang Kai pondered, two figures suddenly streaked toward him from a hundred zhang away; they wore matching robes and appeared to hail from the same Sect. Both were cultivators of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Yang Kai detected the abundant, pure Saint Yuan about them — not something ordinary among Third Stage Saint King Realm practitioners — and guessed they were elite members of some Sect.

They came one after the other at tremendous speed, heading straight for this place without so much as glancing at Yang Kai.

At the edge of the Third Layer they conversed briefly in low tones; then the lead man emitted a pale blue light and was wrapped in a chill, as if he had activated an ice-type Secret Treasure to shield his body. Without hesitation he plunged into the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone.

Yang Kai watched, dumbfounded.

Wasn't the Third Layer supposed to be a place of no return? Was this man mad or foolish to rush straight in?

Wei Guchang would not have lied to him — Yang Kai was certain of that; Wei Guchang had warned him very seriously — yet the scene before him was starkly at odds with that warning.

The second man, too, began to exude a frigid aura and was about to enter the Heat-Flame Zone. Yang Kai hurriedly called out, "Friend, wait!"

At the shout the man frowned and looked toward Yang Kai with obvious displeasure.

When he and his fellow disciple had arrived here they had not failed to notice Yang Kai; it was simply that a First Stage Saint King Realm cultivator was not worth their attention.

But now this person had the audacity to stop them, and the man coldly asked, "What is it?"

Yang Kai cupped his hands and, knowing the other's ill temper, forced a smile and asked, "Please forgive me, friend — I'm merely curious. Wasn't the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone said to be perilous beyond measure, a place where those who enter do not return? How is it that you and your companion would still go in?"

"No return?" the man scoffed, casting a sidelong glance at Yang Kai. "That's old news. When the Flowing Flame Sandland opened before, that was indeed the case, but this time things seem different. I don't know the specifics; in any case the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone is enterable now. Of course, someone of your cultivation would do well not to go looking for death!"

Saying this, he broke into the Heat-Flame Zone with an impatient air, no longer bothering with Yang Kai.

After they left, Yang Kai stood there with a peculiar expression.

The Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland could actually be entered now? From the man's words he seemed unaware of the cause, merely following others into it.

No wonder there were so few people in the heaven-and-earth treasure area — many had gone into the Third Layer.

Yang Kai did not know how this news had circulated or been verified, but with two or three thousand warriors entering the Second Layer — all elites of their respective Sects — it was not surprising that they had discovered this.

Since the Flowing Flame Sandland opened, its Third Layer had been unattended and unenterable; it was difficult to imagine how much treasure lay inside waiting to be exploited.

Tracing the Flowing Flame Sandland's history, it had already lasted tens of thousands of years; a place unstepped upon for such millennia could hardly be lacking in rich finds.

No wonder these fellows dove in as if they had no regard for their lives; even if they risked a little, as long as they could obtain enough benefit, what did it matter?

Profit has always accompanied risk; cultivators do not fear danger — the more dangerous a place, the more it stimulates them.

Since others had already gone in, Yang Kai did not delay; he immediately circulated his Saint Yuan and set foot into the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone.

Heat waves engulfed him from all sides; in an instant Yang Kai felt his skin burn with painful stings, and the fire poison borne in the heat was far more potent than that of the outer Heat-Flame Zone — its toxicity and power several times greater.

In such a perilous region, aside from those fully prepared and powerful Third Stage Saint King Realm cultivators, no one else should be able to enter.

Even if a Second Stage warrior managed to come in, they could not last more than a few days and would have to leave — in such a hellhole the consumption was too great; one could not circulate techniques to replenish Saint Yuan, and relying solely on Saint Crystal would be completely insufficient.

Three to four thousand had entered the Second Layer heaven-and-earth treasure area, but Yang Kai estimated those who could get into the Third Layer numbered fewer than five hundred, and with time that number would only shrink — some would die within, some would withdraw, and only the most elite would remain.

The heat exhilarated Yang Kai; though it was not yet adequate for his needs to refine Profound Yin Moon Water, by pushing deeper he could surely find a suitable place.

The situation in the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone was indeed far more dangerous than the first: the Fire Spirit Beasts that burst from crevices and gullies were Seventh- and Eighth-Tier, not Fifth- or Sixth-Tier, and they traveled in packs — lone Fire Spirit Beasts were rare.

In such a place, if one did not travel with companions, being ambushed by a pack of Fire Spirit Beasts would end in a miserable fate.

Within less than a day Yang Kai encountered three marauding packs of Fire Spirit Beasts; he killed the first two and collected many Crystal Stones, but the third pack was simply too large, and he had to lie low.

In that strange valley of the first Heat-Flame Zone he could face tens of thousands and wreak havoc because the beasts there were low in rank — mostly Fifth- and Sixth-Tier — and could be slaughtered in groups.

But here it was different; contending with those beasts would merely squander his strength, so Yang Kai sensibly avoided them.

At present Yang Kai paused at a certain spot in the Third Layer and looked ahead.

Not far in front lay two mutilated corpses, their bodies charred and emitting a faint stench of rot.

They were a man and a woman; from their attire they appeared to be elite disciples of Yingyue Hall. Those who could penetrate this deep would surely have been following Wei Guchang, so Yang Kai guessed he had seen them before.

When waiting for the Flowing Flame Sandland to open, a few people had stood behind Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er; these two were likely among them.

Now they had perished here, and from their condition it seemed Wei Guchang had not even had time to retrieve their bodies — the circumstances then must have been dire.

Could Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er have gotten into trouble? Yang Kai frowned, withdrew the Communication Compass Wei Guchang had given him from his Spatial Ring, and poured his Divine Sense into it to attempt contact.

But after pouring his Divine Sense into it and waiting a long time Yang Kai received no response; he could not tell whether they were too far away, had no time to check the compass, or had placed it in a ring.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai produced two Demonic Flames, burned the two Yingyue Hall disciples' corpses to ashes, and pressed on deeper.

He had never spoken a word to those two Yingyue Hall disciples; out of respect for Qian Tong and Wei Guchang he would not leave their bodies to rot in the open — cremating them was the utmost mercy he would offer. He had no intention of looking for a place to bury them.

The Third Layer was fraught with peril, yet truly abundant in treasures.

Yang Kai soon harvested a dozen or so rare fire-attributed Spiritual Herbs and Medicines; each specimen was fully aged and could not be compared to those gathered in the Second Layer.

Judging by the condensation of their medicinal efficacy, the youngest had reached at least three thousand years, and the oldest defied Yang Kai's estimate — at the very least it was a ten-thousand-year Spirit Medicine.

Their grade was not low: all Origin-Grade Upper-Level materials, with two even at Void King-Grade.

Ten-thousand-year Origin-Grade materials were already worth no less than Void King-Grade; these herbs would be of great use to Yang Kai and were unobtainable outside. With them he could refine the finest Pills and even have a chance to elevate a Pill's grade.

How many layers the Flowing Flame Sandland truly possessed Yang Kai did not know, but he could at least confirm there were three layers of space.

The deeper one went, the narrower the area where cultivators could move — and the easier it became to run into others. Yang Kai knew his own limits well; as someone at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, merely entering the Second Layer was already shocking enough. If anyone were to discover that he could move freely within the Third Layer, it would surely cause an uproar.

Thus since entering the Third Layer he had done his best to avoid others; at the first hint of another living aura in his Divine Sense he would immediately flee.

By doing so he had remained undisturbed.

Slaying Fire Spirit Beasts and collecting Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine, harboring hopes of refining Profound Yin Moon Water, Yang Kai was in high spirits.
