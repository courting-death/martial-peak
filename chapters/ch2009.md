## Chapter 2009 — Feeling Off

After hearing Zhang Gaoxuan's words, Yang Kai nodded and said, “Your request is reasonable; I agree. But…aren't you afraid I won't keep my word?”

Zhang Gaoxuan gave a wry smile. “What is the use of fear? I do not have long to live. If there is no suitable person to entrust it to, the Dao Origin Fruit will remain inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda and my Zhang family will gain nothing. So I must try my luck. It is a pity I do not possess a soul contract; otherwise I would not have to worry.”

“Shall I swear an oath then?” Yang Kai grinned.

Zhang Gaoxuan glanced at him and said lightly, “Never mind; oaths…ha, I truly have no other choice, and from what I see your disposition is not bad, so I have done this. Besides, when you leave I would like to ask you to stay and preside over the Zhang family for ten years.”

“Ten years?” Yang Kai snorted coldly. “You sure know how to make a lion's demand.”

“Is ten years excessive?” Zhang Gaoxuan looked at Yang Kai in surprise. “You must understand, what I am giving you is a Dao Origin Fruit. Ordinary martial… practitioners, even if they exhausted their whole lives, could not expect to see one. With it, your chances of ascending to the Dao Origin Realm increase by at least forty to fifty percent. Provided your aptitude is not too poor, promotion is absolutely guaranteed.”

Yang Kai said calmly, “To be honest, I could ascend even without a Dao Origin Fruit, so its appeal to me is not that great.”

“What a bold claim!” Zhang Gaoxuan was somewhat shocked; he scrutinized Yang Kai from head to toe to see if he was bluffing, but Yang Kai's expression remained perfectly composed.

After a long while, he sighed. “It seems your aptitude truly is extraordinary, if even a Dao Origin Fruit cannot stir you. Very well, then forget the ten years — three years.”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Zhang Gaoxuan's expression changed; he said angrily, “Then what do you want? Three years is nothing. For Void King Realm Third Stage cultivators like you and me, it's hardly long. The condition is already generous.”

Yang Kai laughed lightly. “This is not about ten years or three years — I will not be bound by time. Not even one year. I cannot guarantee how long I will remain in Fenglin City. If something happens and I must leave, would that not break the agreement and become my lifelong regret? I will not make such a losing bargain.”

Zhang Gaoxuan was taken aback for a moment, then a smile appeared. “It seems I judged correctly. You are indeed a man who keeps his word.”

Yang Kai bargaining with him showed he truly intended to make the trade and would honor the agreement; otherwise he would have simply accepted at once and ignored it later.

The mention of lifelong regret added to Zhang Gaoxuan's confidence in him.

If a man did not keep his word, he would never become haunted by regret for breaking a promise.

“Very well. I will agree that while I remain in Fenglin City, to the extent I can, I will help the Zhang family a little. If the Zhang family asks for something excessive, I will refuse. And…they may only make three requests of me.” Yang Kai considered and then said.

“Three requests…” Zhang Gaoxuan pondered for a long while before looking up. “Fine, three it is. However, I need you to deliver a message to the Zhang family for me.”

“That is no problem.” Yang Kai nodded.

With that, the two reached an agreement. Yang Kai stood quietly to one side while Zhang Gaoxuan produced a jade slip and poured his Divine Sense into it, apparently leaving some last words.

A moment later everything was settled. Zhang Gaoxuan handed the jade slip to Yang Kai and watched as he solemnly put it away. Only then did he breathe a long sigh and say, “I entrust everything to you.”

“Where is the Dao Origin Fruit located…” Yang Kai asked.

Zhang Gaoxuan smiled faintly, pointed, and said, “See the small hill? The Dao Origin Fruit is there. As for the exact spot…”

At that, Zhang Gaoxuan suddenly fell silent, but his lips moved and he transmitted the rest by Divine Sense.

Yang Kai quickly understood.

“Friend, take this Spatial Ring of mine back to the Zhang family as well; I have no use for it.” Zhang Gaoxuan slowly removed the spatial ring from his hand and tossed it to Yang Kai.

……

An hour later, Yang Kai arrived at the opposite peak and, following Zhang Gaoxuan's hints, found where he had hidden the Dao Origin Fruit.

“He was cautious indeed,” Yang Kai muttered to himself.

The Zhang family's head had not only hidden the Dao Origin Fruit elsewhere but had set a barrier at the hiding place that required his own Essence-Blood as a key to safely open. If one tried to break it by force, the barrier's power would destroy the Dao Origin Fruit.

In other words, if anyone wanted to harm Zhang Gaoxuan and force him to reveal the fruit's location, without his active cooperation to offer his Essence-Blood they could not succeed — they'd only fail and lose everything.

And after Zhang Gaoxuan had bled a drop of Essence-Blood in his grievous state, his condition grew ever worse.

Yang Kai estimated that it would be a blessing if he could live another day; he might be dead within half a day.

Using the method Zhang Gaoxuan had taught earlier to break the barrier, Yang Kai used the drop of Essence-Blood as a key and poured it into the seal.

A moment later, the barrier dissipated and a finely made wooden box appeared on the spot.

Yang Kai waved his hand and drew the box to him, opening it slowly. Inside lay a fruit roughly the size of an apricot, its skin golden all over. Its scent was pleasantly fragrant, and within that aroma seemed to be some wondrous power that allowed a martial artist to more clearly sense the Power of the Laws around them.

The Dao Origin Fruit was used to refine Dao Origin Pills to aid a martial artist's ascent to the Dao Origin Realm, so such effects were not surprising.

However, Yang Kai noticed the Dao Origin Fruit was somewhat dry; it seemed it had been picked many months ago and had lost some of its medicinal properties.

“Tianwu Sacred Land…” Yang Kai shook his head slowly, harboring some resentment toward the top sect of the Southern Territory.

Previously, the martial artists of Fenglin City had gone nearly mad when they heard Tianwu Sacred Land had placed three Dao Origin Fruits into the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda. Now that one was truly in hand, Yang Kai realized this Dao Origin Fruit was definitely a leftover from Tianwu Sacred Land's storeroom.

It made sense: if the fruit were truly high quality, Tianwu Sacred Land would not have given it away.

Even so, it remained a Dao Origin Fruit. It would certainly serve to refine Dao Origin Pills, though the yield might be somewhat lower.

Carefully stowing the Dao Origin Fruit, Yang Kai leapt up and soon vanished into the void.

Two days later, led by the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat, Yang Kai arrived at a desolate valley.

Once there, the little beast seemed extremely delighted; after a slight wiggle it burrowed into the earth and moved forward at great speed, and before long it arrived behind a dirt slope.

Yang Kai frowned and released his Divine Sense to probe ahead. Before he could discern anything, Mo Xiaoqi's voice came to his ear: “Eldest Brother Yang!”

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and he tracked the voice to determine Mo Xiaoqi's position, but he could not see her at all — she seemed to have used some secret art to completely conceal her presence.

In Yuqing Mountain, Yang Kai had already discovered Mo Xiaoqi's concealment art was extraordinary; now he realized he had still underestimated her means.

He had no idea what she was up to, being so secretive.

Yang Kai shifted his stance, employed the Nothingness technique to gather his aura, and advanced step by step.

A short while later he reached the front of the dirt slope and peered carefully, finally detecting a trace. He could not help but laugh. “Xiaoqi, what are you hiding here for?”

“Shh…” Mo Xiaoqi put a forefinger to her lips and signaled Yang Kai to look forward.

Yang Kai, puzzled, crouched down and followed her indication, glancing in that direction.

What met his eyes surprised him greatly.

About ten li ahead, many martial artists had gathered — roughly dozens — sitting in small groups with their legs crossed, each exerting their skills and pouring their power toward a central spot.

“What are they doing?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

“I don't know either. It seems they've found a barrier and are trying to break it together,” Mo Xiaoqi replied softly.

“Oh?” Yang Kai's interest was piqued. “A barrier means treasure, right? Why didn't you go join the fun?”

Mo Xiaoqi frowned and shook her head. “I feel something is wrong. That barrier may not be protecting a treasure.”

“If not a treasure, then what?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“I don't know. That's why I'm here watching,” Mo Xiaoqi answered matter-of-factly.

Yang Kai fell silent; he was curious too — what kind of barrier would require so many Void King Realm cultivators working together to crack?

Generally, the stronger the barrier, the more extraordinary whatever is sealed within. A barrier that required dozens of Void King Realm cultivators might at least conceal a Dao Origin-Grade treasure, perhaps even an Imperial-Grade one.

No wonder so many people could cooperate there without incident.

“What about your feeling — what feels off?” Yang Kai asked after thinking for a moment.

It was over ten li away and filled with so many martial artists; he dared not rashly release his Divine Sense to probe, lest he reveal his location.

“I can't explain it. The closer I get, the more anxious I feel, as if something dangerous lurks there,” Mo Xiaoqi replied earnestly.

“Are you certain?” Yang Kai's expression changed.

Martial artists often possessed an intuitive sense of danger; though difficult to explain, when such feelings appeared it signified they might truly encounter peril.

Mo Xiaoqi came from an uncommon background; if she had such a feeling, then whatever the barrier sealed was very likely something dangerous.

“I'm still uneasy,” Mo Xiaoqi patted her chest with her small hand. “And Xiao Fu feels it too.”
