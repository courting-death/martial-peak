## Chapter 2210 — The World Within the Mirror

"Oh? Little Qian-Qian has something she doesn't understand? I thought you were clever beyond your years and knew everything." Wen Zishan said with a faint smile.

Chen Qian immediately glared at him and said, "Hall Master, Sister Gao was raised by you, so it's fine for you to speak to her like that, but I'm not! If you keep acting so old-fashioned, be careful or you'll end up a bachelor for life!"

Wen Zishan instantly broke out in a cold sweat and said awkwardly, "Uh, let's change the subject. What did you want to ask just now?"

"Back then... why didn't you kill... Granny You?" Chen Qian's expression turned solemn as she asked in a low voice.

Wen Zishan's expression also became serious. After pondering for a moment, he replied, "It's not that I didn't want to kill her, but that I couldn't!"

Chen Qian asked in confusion, "I don't understand."

Wen Zishan said, "When I first came to the Qingyang Mountain Range, it was because I discovered the Divine Roaming Mirror that I settled here. At that time, that old woman was already guarding the Divine Roaming Mirror. It seems she had been living here for two thousand years. When I first saw such a rare treasure, of course I was eager to take a look, but you know her temper—she refused no matter what. In the end, I had no choice but to fight her..."

"So you won, and Granny You lost?"

"Yes," Wen Zishan nodded. "Although our Divine Senses were about equal, she only had the cultivation of the First Stage of the Emperor Realm. In overall strength, I was a bit stronger. At that time, I realized she was no good—vicious and ruthless. If I could have killed her, I wouldn't have shown mercy. But after living with the Divine Roaming Mirror for so long, she seemed to have grasped some of its mysteries. She couldn't use it to fight, but she could use a special method to shut it down! If I pushed her too hard and she closed the treasure, even if I got it, it would be useless!"

Hearing this, Chen Qian understood much more and nodded slightly. "So the Hall Master had his concerns..."

"Exactly!" Wen Zishan said. "So I made a deal with her: I wouldn't take her life or touch the Divine Roaming Mirror, but when I needed to use it, she had to cooperate."

Chen Qian looked enlightened. "No wonder... When I went to train in the Divine Roaming Mirror back then, Granny You looked so unwilling but had no choice but to open it. So that's why."

"It wasn't just you..." Wen Zishan chuckled. "Every time the Divine Roaming Mirror is opened, isn't she always like that? She treats it as her property and won't let anyone else touch it!"

At this point, Wen Zishan snorted coldly. "Over the years, she's been cooperative enough, but who knows how many tricks she's played inside, costing my Shrine so many lives!"

Hearing this, Chen Qian's face changed, and she looked at Wen Zishan in shock. "Hall Master, you mean..."

Wen Zishan sneered, "She thinks she's done it without anyone knowing, but everything is under my control. Still... she hasn't gone too far, so I can't be bothered to expose her."

"But those disciples who died..." Chen Qian looked pained.

Wen Zishan sighed deeply. "That's also a kind of trial. Those who pass will become stronger. Those who don't can only fall—it's all fate and fortune!"

Chen Qian looked a bit frightened and patted her chest. "Luckily, I passed back then." After a pause, she asked, "Hall Master, why are you willing to let an outsider enter the Divine Roaming Mirror this time? This is the Shrine's greatest secret—even most disciples don't know about it."

"No special reason, I just want to test his abilities!" Wen Zishan smiled faintly.

Chen Qian said, "Because of the Mortal Great Emperor, right? That boy came with the Mortal Great Emperor's token, and I heard you were raised by the Mortal Great Emperor..."

"Absolutely not!" Wen Zishan suddenly grew flustered, glaring at Chen Qian. "This Lord was raised on the charity of a hundred families—I have nothing to do with that old fellow Hongchen!"

"Oh? The more you deny, the more suspicious it sounds..." Chen Qian smiled with pursed lips.

"Utter nonsense!"

"You're just making it more obvious..."

"Little Qian-Qian..." Wen Zishan suddenly softened his voice and called out affectionately.

Chen Qian's face changed dramatically and she hurriedly said, "Hall Master, I just remembered something else I need to do, I'll be going now!"

As she spoke, her figure flickered and she left Wen Zishan's sight.

Past experience told her that when Wen Zishan tried to change the subject and used that tone with her, it was best to run away immediately, or else... she would be tormented to death!

"Hmph, little girl is too naive, still dares to spar with this old man, truly overestimating herself, wahahaha!" Wen Zishan, feeling pleased, showed an expression of invincibility, loneliness at the top, and let out a bone-chilling laugh.

……

In a strange space, six figures appeared one after another.

The appearance of these six figures shifted from illusion to reality, gradually solidifying. The whole process was extremely peculiar, and after solidifying, each of them let out a painful groan, clearly feeling very uncomfortable.

But soon, everyone recovered.

They turned their heads, looking around at each other.

"Is this the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror?" Xia Sheng asked in amazement.

"My body feels a bit different!" Murong Xiaoxiao said with a slight frown.

"It should be because we're Spirit Bodies," Xiao Baiyi replied.

"It's really hard to get used to!" Shen Muji also complained.

Yang Kai didn't speak, just quietly clenched his fist, feeling the difference in his current body compared to usual.

What he saw was basically the same as outside—everyone's appearance and clothing were identical to before. But if one examined closely, it was clear that none of them had a physical body here. In other words, everyone was now formed purely of energy. Although they appeared solid, they had no true substance!

"As I told you before," Gao Xueting quickly adapted, likely because she had been here before or was simply stronger. "Now that we've entered the Divine Roaming Mirror, we are only Spirit Bodies. Our physical bodies are still in the stone chambers of the cave. The world inside the Divine Roaming Mirror is entirely made of energy, so here we can rapidly strengthen our Divine Sense. If a martial artist's Divine Sense is strong, their speed in comprehending techniques and cultivating secret arts will greatly increase, and there are countless other benefits. Divine Sense is a martial artist's most important foundation besides the physical body, so this is a rare experience for you all. If you can raise your Divine Sense to a certain level here, it will be much easier to advance to the Emperor Realm in the future."

"Understood," Xiao Baiyi and the others cupped their fists in response.

"The energy in the Divine Roaming Mirror is also very different from the outside. When we cultivate outside, the Spiritual Qi we absorb turns into our own Origin Qi, increasing our strength. But here, the energy we absorb will strengthen our Divine Sense. I think you should be able to feel that now," Gao Xueting continued.

Everyone nodded slightly.

Yang Kai indeed felt it—the energy in this strange world was completely different from the outside.

The energy drifting around was absorbed into his body, strengthening his Spirit Body and making his Divine Soul tougher and stronger.

"To strengthen your Divine Sense here, besides cultivating, you can also do it by slaying other living beings!"

"There are other living beings here?" Xiao Baiyi's expression changed.

Gao Xueting glanced at him and said, "This is a unique world—why wouldn't there be other living beings?"

Xiao Baiyi was left speechless by her question.

Gao Xueting continued, "According to the Hall Master, the Divine Roaming Mirror is a rare treasure that has existed since the dawn of heaven and earth. It contains its own world. Although it's not as vast as the Star Realm, or even as large as the Southern Territory, since it's a world, it has its own vitality. Here, there are people, Demonic Beasts... everything the Star Realm has, this place has too! But, they are all formed from Divine Souls, and... they don't seem to know it. They think the world is naturally like this and have never experienced having a physical body. Here, I must remind you: avoid contact with outsiders as much as possible. There are many powerful beings in the Divine Roaming Mirror, and you can't afford to provoke them."

"However, if you can slay any hostile living beings, you can absorb their energy. The energy here is very pure and can be absorbed by our Spirit Bodies, greatly strengthening our Divine Souls!"

Hearing this, everyone's eyes lit up.

"Maybe you still don't quite understand, so let's find one to try it out. Then you'll get it." As she spoke, Gao Xueting closed her beautiful eyes, and her powerful Divine Sense at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm spread out in all directions.

After a moment, she opened her eyes and said, "Follow me."

As she spoke, she sped off, and everyone hurried after her.
They soon arrived at a vast plain, where the grass grew tall and the hawks soared fat and strong, birds sang and flowers bloomed, filling the air with vitality. Yet, curiously, there was no sun in the sky, though the world was bathed in ample light. No one could tell where this radiance came from, but it illuminated everything as if it were daylight.

Following Gao Xueting, the group traveled for more than ten li when, all of a sudden, a Demonic Beast appeared ahead of them.

Looking over, they saw it was a kind they had never seen before. It resembled a wild beast but was enormous, as tall as a building, with two curling fangs.

In an instant, several Dao Origin Realm Divine Senses swept over and probed the Demonic Beast. After a quick investigation, they determined that this creature was roughly at the peak of the Tenth Tier—in other words, it was equivalent to a Demonic Beast at the peak of the Void King Realm.

Such a Demonic Beast naturally wasn't worth their attention, but it was perfect for Gao Xueting's demonstration.

It seemed Gao Xueting had chosen her target deliberately.
