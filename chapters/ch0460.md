## Chapter 460 — Rivers of Blood

After waiting a while, the array’s light beneath the lake flared once more, the blood-red water exuded a chilling, gloomy aura that sent shivers down one’s spine. Absolute power…

From prior experience, everyone knew the third batch of treasures was about to appear. Those watching the coming battle were eagerly anticipant, each seeking favorable positions and angles, awaiting the grand spectacle.

Yang Kai’s side had received his orders; though some gazed longingly at the lake below, none harbored other thoughts.

Meanwhile, Yang Kang and his companions were all cracking their knuckles, ready to unleash their full strength.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Another beam of Dao light shot forth, signaling the appearance of yet another treasure.

“Charge! Anyone dares to steal it dies!” Yang Kang shouted sharply, his men quickly moving out.

Simultaneously, Yang Shen and Yang Ying issued nearly identical commands, their faces hard and resolute, as if harboring deep-seated enmity against all others present.

But as these three forces surged forward, everyone watching was struck with surprise: two other factions remained completely still.

One was Yang Kai, the other Yang Wei.

The eldest and youngest brothers seemingly content with what they had already claimed, showing no intention to continue fighting.

“What the hell? Why aren’t those two making a move?” the crowd yelled. Six-way skirmishes were the most thrilling, but with two sides standing down, things lost their excitement.

“Are they scared? What sort of coward comes to a succession war only to chicken out?”

“Hurry up, what are you waiting for? A bunch of dumb pigs. Driving me nuts!”

“Damn it! Such an opportunity, yet no one seizes it. If my sect were stronger, I’d have already pledged to a young master and be grabbing those treasures!”

… 

Amid the uproar, Yang Kai glanced curiously at Yang Wei. Rarely did he see him smile slightly in his direction, as if silently signaling, “I see through you.”

“Fall back!” Moments later, Yang Zhao frowned deeply, suddenly shouting harshly at his allies.

The martial artists, once fired up and already halfway out to seize treasures, froze in confusion. Some reacted quickly and retreated beside Yang Zhao; others, unwilling to forgo the chance, greedily grabbed treasures within reach.

But at that instant, a violent backlash suddenly exploded in the space above the center of Po Jing Lake.

Boom—whoosh—crack!

Flames flickered, lightning cracked, snow descended, and shocking sword energies erupted. Jagged, sharp ice shards warped into existence while golden threads spiraled through the sky like razor edges, cutting through everything. Centered on the treasures, countless attacks shot out in all directions.

Everyone was stunned.

Spectators continued to shout, not understanding why Yang Kai and Yang Wei remained inactive. The fighting martial artists, focused on each other, were caught completely off guard by the sudden barrage.

Most were True Essence Realm cultivators, utterly unprepared for such calamity.

The attacks were chaotic and individually not exceedingly powerful, but overwhelming in number, striking like a torrential barrage.

A scattering of grains becomes a mountain; drops of water fill a river. How could these True Essence cultivators withstand?

Within a blink, those clustered at the center were wiped out, limbs torn apart, blood raining down like torrential rain.

Within a radius of twenty zhang, a vacuum appeared, as if swallowed by an invisible black hole.

The few cultivators farther away fled in terror, glancing back at the grisly scene with shock and dread, mingled with the relief of having survived sheer catastrophe.

Silence returned, pierced only by the harsh splashes of bodies sinking beneath the lake’s surface.

“Insidious!” Yang Kai’s eyes sharpened, his voice a cold growl.

Those sudden energy bursts were not attacks from contesting martial artists, but emanated from the treasures themselves.

The third batch had clearly been tampered with beforehand, filled with True Essence by powerful figures, designed to unleash their might the moment someone took hold—striking the martial artists utterly unprepared.

This was a trap! The Yang Family’s scheme targeting the contenders vying for these treasures!

The earlier batches lulled them into complacency; the third delivered the deadly blow.

“If our people had charged just now…” Shu Xiaoyu’s pale face betrayed her horror. Though no stranger to death, having killed with her own hands during foreign training and witnessed nearly fifty martial artists fall in the treasure contest, the rapid massacre was still terrifying.

“Young Master Kai, my respect for you runs deep into my soul!” Huo Xingchen’s face twitched. When Yang Kai had earlier ordered them not to contest the next batch of treasures, Huo had thought it overly cautious. Now it was clear he had foreseen such danger.

Had their side charged then, they’d have suffered terrible losses!

Recognizing this, Huo Xingchen and all present looked upon Yang Kai with newfound regard.

“Young Lord, how did you know…” On the other side, Meng Shanyi of the Meng Family whispered to Yang Wei, his expression shifting subtly.

Yang Wei slowly shook his head. “I do not know, but if Ninth Brother does not move, neither do we. We follow him in all things.”

“You mean you were watching Yang Kai…”

“Mm,” Yang Wei nodded. “The Ninth Brother is cautious by nature. Thanks to him, otherwise…”

Meng Shanyi drew a deep breath, no longer underestimating Yang Kai. Looking at the other Yang Family members, Yang Zhao’s face was a mixture of relief and fright. Thanks to his timely orders, their side lost only three reckless martial artists, whereas Yang Kang’s faction looked grim indeed.

Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying’s forces suffered the most. Each man had charged faster than the last when the third batch appeared, and the central explosion struck almost entirely upon their ranks.

Each family lost over a dozen men, with countless injuries, including lower-stage Divine Roaming Realm cultivators.

The sagacity of Yang Kai and Yang Wei made their failures all the more glaring, stirring both shame and anger.

The treasures hovering above the lake seemed to have expended their full power in that instant. Now, their light dimmed; as the martial artists withdrew, the treasures fell onto the lake’s surface.

Having suffered heavy losses, no one dared to approach rashly this time.

“We can start seizing them now!” Yang Kai squinted and said faintly.

“What are you waiting for?” Huo Xingchen shouted.

Yang Kai’s faction sallied forth, leaving only leaders of the younger generation and some Divine Roaming Realm cultivators behind.

At the same time, Yang Wei seemed to issue orders, determined to act alongside Yang Kai.

Others flying above Po Jing Lake had witnessed the two factions’ moves but remained shaken and without their lord’s commands, unwilling to act rashly.

Yang Kang and his allies hesitated long before daring to move.

Before the treasures sank into the lake, the martial artists who surged forward seized them swiftly, with no recurrence of the earlier deadly backlash.

Unexpectedly, these two factions made rich gains and returned without unleashing conflict.

Seeing this, Yang Kang and his companions were filled with bitter regret, as was Yang Zhao. He had hesitated prematurely, or else they could have shared in the spoils.

“Fifty-four treasures!” Huo Xingchen counted excitedly. “And all Earth-Grade Upper-Level quality!”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and glanced toward Yang Wei, instructing, “Eldest Brother’s men, avoid conflicts with ours from now on.”

“We understand!” all replied in unison.

Yang Kai had clearly seen that a few from his side attacked Yang Wei’s allies during the scramble, but those defenders held only to defense, not retaliation, suggesting orders from Yang Wei.

That explained why their side had claimed a few more treasures.

It seemed Eldest Brother intended to ally with him, showing goodwill by refraining from hostility.

“Young Master Kai, what shall we do next? Still watch and wait?” Young Master Huo smiled and inquired.

Yang Kai shook his head. “They are not fools. That stroke of luck won’t come twice. The next batch will still be contested, but you must anticipate not only enemy attacks but also those treasures’ triggered counterattacks. Use all defensive martial skills and artifacts. Don’t die too soon.”

Everyone nodded solemnly.

The third batch’s fatal onslaught had killed so many because nobody expected the treasures themselves to be weaponized. Even Divine Roaming Realm cultivators were overwhelmed.

And that was only the third batch. With a thousand treasures in total, how many more would die?

At this thought, thrill-seekers and warriors alike shuddered.

The Yang Family and the other Seven Great Families’ tactics were exceedingly cruel.

“Young Master Kai, what should we do with all these treasures? Too many,” Huo Xingchen grinned, proud.

“Leave the care to the five seniors of the Duanmu Family,” Yang Kai replied with a frown.

The hoarded treasures were various in form and size, some comparable to earrings, others large as halberds or javelins—impractical to carry without attendants.

Assigning a group of experts to manage them was thus necessary, and Yang Kai expected others to do the same.
