## Chapter 131 — The First Set of Martial Techniques

It had remained silent, unlike other stone sculptures that would launch attacks.

However, Yang Kai keenly noticed that with each of his strikes, the stone sculpture absorbed a portion of the True Yang Yuan Qi he emitted.

As time passed, a faint red glow began to rise from the stone sculpture, radiating a wave of Yang attribute Qi that was identical to Yang Kai's own.

Crack, crack, crack...

The stone sculpture's massive hand seemed to move slowly. Yang Kai's heart skipped a beat as he suddenly understood.

It was indeed absorbing the Qi attached to his attacks, using it as energy to make itself move. However, the amount of Qi absorbed was too little, insufficient to support any significant movement.

Realizing this, Yang Kai did not stop; instead, he became even more ruthless in his strikes.

Let's see whether you move first, or I smash you to pieces! With a stubborn resolve, Yang Kai unleashed a flurry of punches.

His fists were a bloody mess, as the hardness of this stone sculpture was far superior to the others.

Crack, crack, crack... The amount of Qi the stone sculpture absorbed increased, and its movements became more pronounced. A gigantic palm was raised high, looking down at Yang Kai, ready to come crashing down.

However, the area on the stone sculpture's chest that Yang Kai had relentlessly attacked was also in tatters, riddled with cracks.

With a whoosh, the stone sculpture's palm descended at an astonishing speed. Fortunately, Yang Kai had anticipated this and quickly dodged.

The ground trembled lightly, leaving a palm imprint on the surface, dust swirling around, causing Yang Kai's clothes and hair to flutter wildly.

Boom, boom, boom...

In that instant, a blaze erupted from Yang Kai's fists, as if he were wielding two flaming orbs. Both the speed and power of his punches surged dramatically.

With a crash...

Accompanied by a fierce strike, a massive hole was finally punched through the stone sculpture's chest, debris scattering across the ground.

Yang Kai caught sight of a translucent Little Stone Man inside.

He quickly retrieved it and tucked it into his bosom, then leaped out of the pit before the stone sculpture could strike again.

Turning to look around, he saw that the dozens of stone sculptures that had been diverted earlier were almost back.

Yang Kai's expression darkened; he dared not hesitate for a moment and hurriedly increased his speed to the limit, fleeing in haste.

After making a wide detour, Yang Kai finally returned to the spot where the others were.

As soon as he appeared, Du Yishuang joyfully said to him, "We finally got another Little Stone Man! Now each of us has one."

"Hehe, it seems my luck is quite good," Yang Kai chuckled lightly, casting a casual glance at Lan Chudie, who was also smiling at him. Upon seeing his bloodied fists, she quickly approached and took hold of his hand, frowning, "How did you get hurt like this?"

Her expression was filled with concern, a hint of a senior sister's care for her junior brother evident in her brow.

Yang Kai subtly withdrew his hand, replying lightly, "A few stone sculptures chased me too closely, so I had to engage them."

A flicker of surprise crossed Lan Chudie's beautiful face, but she soon smiled gently, "As long as you're safe."

"Let's divide the Little Stone Men first. It will help everyone train and enhance our combat power," Zuo An suggested from the side.

"Alright." Lan Chudie nodded, then took out the five Little Stone Men they had collected over the past few days and laid them before everyone.

The number of red threads in these five Little Stone Men was roughly the same; even if there were more, it wouldn't be by much. Generally, techniques requiring more meridians were of a higher grade, but this was not absolute.

Some special martial techniques, while not low in grade, only required a few meridians to activate.

Thus, the five of them had no way of knowing which of the Little Stone Men contained superior techniques. At such a time, they could only rely on luck and personal fortune.

After working hard for so many days, although the harvest was not as expected, the group's gazes remained fervent. The martial techniques contained within these Little Stone Men were all Earth-Grade.

"Who goes first?" Nie Yong asked eagerly. He wanted to be the first to choose but was hesitant, fearing he might pick a poor one.

"I propose that Junior Brother Yang go first. After all, he has been tirelessly holding off those stone sculptures these past few days and just got injured. It’s only right that he gets to choose first!" Lan Chudie smiled at Yang Kai.

Each person could take one, and she was being quite generous. Moreover, even if one chose first, it didn’t guarantee getting the best.

Her words, though seemingly casual, were effective in winning hearts.

Yang Kai, aware of her intentions, did not decline and nodded, "Since Sister has said so, I will not be polite."

With that, he casually grabbed a Little Stone Man.

Following suit, Lan Chudie and the others each selected one.

"Now that we've divided the items, let’s find a place to familiarize ourselves with our martial techniques. We will regroup here in a day," Lan Chudie instructed.

In this strange place, having an additional martial technique meant an increase in combat power. Although training a martial technique required considerable time, the group was willing to accept the investment of a day.

Everyone nodded and turned to leave.

"Yang Kai, let me bandage your wounds," Du Yishuang said, seeing his bloodied hands, feeling a bit reluctant.

"Then I will trouble you," Yang Kai replied without hesitation.

As Lan Chudie, who was about to leave, heard this, her steps paused momentarily, her brows furrowing slightly, but she did not stop, her figure flickering before vanishing from sight.

Once only Yang Kai and Du Yishuang remained, she began to bandage his wounds while saying, "After a while, take a look at your martial technique. If it's not good, I will exchange with you. I have already practiced an Earth-Grade martial technique, so I don't need this as much."

"No need," Yang Kai smiled. "Since it's an Earth-Grade martial technique, it surely won't be bad."

"Suit yourself." Du Yishuang did not press further. After quickly finishing the bandaging, she stood up and said, "I will go familiarize myself with my martial technique. See you tomorrow!"

Watching her retreating figure, Yang Kai slowly said, "If you have the chance, leave on your own."

Du Yishuang replied without looking back, "I know."

This little team was not stable. Although they could temporarily unite, it was only because everyone was unfamiliar with this place. Lan Chudie did not possess the qualities of a leader; she could not balance everyone's interests and would only consider her own gains and losses. Such a person would not care for others' safety in times of danger, and following her would eventually lead to trouble.

Once the surroundings were empty, Yang Kai also left, finding a secluded spot to take out the two Little Stone Men from his bosom.

Looking around, Yang Kai's heart surged.

One of the Little Stone Men was the one he received from Lan Chudie; it was unremarkable, similar to the others. However, the one he obtained from the stone sculpture gathering was vastly different.

The lines representing meridians within this Little Stone Man were not red but golden, and not only that, the number of lines was significantly greater.

What grade of martial technique is this?

According to Lan Chudie's analysis, the martial techniques contained within the five Little Stone Men they obtained were at least Earth-Grade Middle-Level, very likely Earth-Grade Upper-Level.

Yet the Little Stone Man he acquired was clearly of a much higher grade. Could it be... a Heaven-Grade martial technique?

This thought caused Yang Kai's breath to quicken. This decision to take a risk had indeed been worthwhile.

Just the acquisition of these two sets of martial techniques made the journey worthwhile, and this was just the beginning.

Which one should he learn first? Looking at the two Little Stone Men in his hands, Yang Kai felt a bit indecisive.

The martial technique contained within the Little Stone Man he obtained was undoubtedly of a higher grade. Once mastered, it would surely provide greater assistance. However, time was limited; one day might not be enough for him to learn thoroughly. After contemplating for a moment, Yang Kai tucked the one with the golden lines back into his bosom and held the one he received from Lan Chudie in his palm.

Given the current situation, the correct choice was to quickly acquire a martial technique that would enhance his combat power. The one he received would likely be inferior, but the time required for training would undoubtedly be shorter, and the difficulty would be lower.

Channeling his Yuan Qi, he infused it into the Little Stone Man in his hand, feeling the distribution and operation trajectory of the red lines within, while comparing it to the meridians in his body. In less than an hour, Yang Kai had memorized the method of Qi operation.

Slowly opening his eyes, he looked down to see that the red lines inside the Little Stone Man had vanished, and even the Little Stone Man itself had become fragmented.

It had fulfilled its mission! Yang Kai gently crushed it into powder. This item could only allow one person to comprehend the mysteries of the martial technique within; once used, it would be destroyed, likely related to the Yuan Qi infused into it.

There was nothing to regret. Yang Kai stood up, recalling what he had learned from the Little Stone Man, as his Yuan Qi coursed through his meridians.

During his first attempt to execute this martial technique, he inevitably felt clumsy and failed to succeed.

However, he was not discouraged. Once more, he activated his Yuan Qi, rotating it according to the method indicated by the red lines within the Little Stone Man, while attentively sensing the changes in his body.

As the Yuan Qi began to circulate, flowing through those specific meridians, Yang Kai felt a force gradually coalescing at the tip of his fist.

This force initially felt quite weak, but as the Yuan Qi circulated and the meridians supported it, the power rapidly grew, creating an urge to unleash it.

Yang Kai restrained himself from striking, as his Yuan Qi had not yet traversed all the necessary meridians.

After a moment, thirty-six meridians were penetrated by the Yuan Qi, and with a resonance, the Qi within those thirty-six meridians surged toward his fist, amplifying the already considerable force.

It felt as if it wanted to break free from Yang Kai's grasp and surge forth on its own.

Yang Kai's clenched fist trembled slightly.

No longer holding back, he unleashed a fierce punch. As he swung, all the power and Yuan Qi gathered in his fist were released.

In the space where his fist pointed, the energies of heaven and earth instantly became chaotic, followed by a thunderous boom, as if the very space had exploded, sending forth visible waves of fire.

Yang Kai's eyes sparkled, his gaze shining brightly.

Is this the destructive power of martial techniques? Truly formidable!
