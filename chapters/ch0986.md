## Chapter 986 — Sister Protects You

In the starry sky, Yang Kai still wandered.

It had already been some time since he parted ways with the He sisters yet he had made no progress, nor had he been lucky enough to run into them again.

Suddenly, while he was looking around, three presences closed in from behind; their auras were razor-sharp, murderous and bloodthirsty. As the energy swept over him, Yang Kai felt his skin prickle as if pricked by needles, and he involuntarily changed color.

It wasn’t He Miao!

There were three of them, and judging from their auras, they were all experts at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm!

Their presence made Yang Kai uneasy and put him on edge; it felt less like three people arriving and more like three bloodthirsty beasts closing in.

Should he avoid them or wait? The two conflicting thoughts flashed through Yang Kai’s mind, then he stopped and quietly waited.

The three clearly already knew he was there—otherwise they wouldn’t have charged straight at him. If he tried to evade now, it would only stir their pursuit.

Yang Kai wasn’t certain whether his Star Shuttle’s speed would be enough to shake them off.

The crucial point was that he’d finally encountered a second group of sentient beings; perhaps there’d be a chance to find an opening. If he could copy their Star Chart, that would be ideal.

He Miao had said that as long as one had a Star Chart, there was a chance to leave the Chaos Abyss. Though the odds were slim, it was worth trying.

Three Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivators—Yang Kai reckoned that even if a fight broke out, with his current strength, if he gave it his all he should be able to withdraw intact.

So he felt emboldened.

Three streaks of azure light tore through the starry sky, dragging long, greenish-blue rainbows as they approached Yang Kai.

In a short time the azure lights halted in front of him and three figures materialized.

Each of the three had their own Star Shuttle, unlike the two sisters He Miao who had been riding together on one Star Shuttle—evidently these people were well funded.

Two men and a woman. One man was hulking and exuded an unspoken authority. The other was slight, a sardonic smile on his face as he twirled a dagger that flashed silver; a cold glint surfaced in his eyes as he looked at Yang Kai with ill intent.

The woman was seductive, with a pair of peach-blossom eyes sparkling wetly, appraising Yang Kai with keen interest before a mischievous expression crept across her face.

The moment they appeared, Yang Kai knew his worry had come true.

Not everyone was as easy to talk to as the He sisters. From their looks alone these three were trouble. It wouldn’t be surprising if they caused some kind of uproar.

“Kid, where did you come from?” the hulking man asked coldly, staring at Yang Kai. His voice carried an undeniable authority, as if Yang Kai’s life and death meant nothing to him.

“From a low-tier continent,” Yang Kai chose his words cautiously and replied carefully, “I’ve been lost here for a long time and can’t find a way out. If it’s convenient, could you lend me your Star Chart so I can copy it?”

He asked because He Miao had told him that before; though he didn’t know how to copy a Star Chart, he believed that if he could get a hold of their Star Shuttle, he could figure it out.

“Copy a Star Chart?” the man sneered, considering for a moment before nodding with a look of amusement. “Fine, but you have to answer one question honestly.”

“What?” Yang Kai showed no trace of delight; he didn’t think these people were as obliging as they appeared.

As the man agreed, the slight man licked the dagger in his hand, looking as though he was about to start slaughtering at any moment.

Yang Kai guessed that once he finished answering, that slight man would strike—there was never any intention to let him copy their Star Chart.

“You say you’ve been lost here a long time? Have you seen two girls? They should be wearing white robes with a sword-shaped emblem embroidered on their chests.”

Yang Kai frowned and immediately understood—he was being asked about the two He sisters.

A flash ran through his mind: when he’d first met the sisters, He Miao had said some thought-provoking things—she and her sister seemed to be hunted by someone.

Could it be that these three were the ones chasing them?

A crack showed in Yang Kai’s composure as he hesitated, and the hulking man’s eyes brightened. He stepped forward and barked, “You’ve seen them, haven’t you?”

“Why are you looking for them?” Yang Kai countered instead of answering.

“Kid, this isn’t your business—just answer the question. There are benefits for you if you cooperate; if you refuse, I don’t mind making you cooperate,” the slight man hissed like a venomous snake.

At this point denial was pointless. Yang Kai nodded straightaway: “Yes, I’ve seen them.”

“When did you see them? Where are they now?” the hulking man urged impatiently, as if the sisters were very important to him.

“I don’t know the exact time. About a month ago they landed on a meteorite; I asked them about the route,” Yang Kai answered with an air of innocence.

“A month ago? What did the meteorite look like? Where was it located?”

Yang Kai shrugged, “I don’t remember!”

“Useless!” the hulking man shouted angrily, clearly exasperated.

A faint, hidden chill flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes.

“Liu Shan, why are you so worked up…” the bewitching woman giggled, coquettishly twisting her hips and sending out a ripple of intoxicating charm. “He’s just a little kid lost here—what could he possibly know? At least we can be sure those two little bitches are indeed here.”

Saying that, she turned a soft look to Yang Kai and cooed, “Little one, don’t be afraid. Sister asks: were the two of them lost as well?”

Her voice was like an invisible hand that plucked at Yang Kai’s heartstrings, stirring his blood and arousing a primitive response.

Her seductive arts worked!

A chill ran through Yang Kai, and he shivered, yet he maintained a randy pretense: “Yes, they were lost. I heard them say the Star Chart in their Star Shuttle was damaged.”

His performance pleased the woman greatly; she shot a satisfied glance at the hulking man called Liu Shan, though Liu Shan looked down on her tactics. His gaze toward Yang Kai grew colder—he thought the kid was merely a lecher who couldn’t resist a beautiful woman.

“Ha ha, lost is good!” the slight man laughed loudly.

“Kill him. Since he doesn’t know where those two little bitches are, there’s no use keeping him,” Liu Shan said impatiently, waving his hand.

The slight man suddenly exuded a sinister chill, clearly eager to strike Yang Kai.

“What’s the hurry!” the woman quickly intervened.

“What do you want him for? Don’t forget we still have a mission; once this is done you can have as many men as you want,” Liu Shan said darkly.

“What if I want you?” the woman batted her eyelashes at him.

“Forget it. I don’t want any entanglements; I’d like to live a few more years,” Liu Shan snorted, unimpressed.

“Then don’t kill him. Saint Realm youths aren’t something you can always find—killing him would be a waste,” the woman put on a stern face. “Besides, we’ve already learned some important information; shouldn’t we hurry back to report? Do you want to keep searching? In this vast starry void, finding two people isn’t that simple.”

After much thought Liu Shan conceded, “Fine, we’ll do it your way this time. We should indeed return to report.” He didn’t want to anger the woman and ultimately compromised.

“Come with Sister; I’ll protect you. With me here, no one will harm you,” the woman said warmly, beckoning Yang Kai.

“Thanks.” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he considered, then said, “I can cooperate with you. Actually I have some grudges with those two little bitches.”

“Oh? What grudges?” the woman asked curiously, and even Liu Shan and the slight man looked on with suspicion.

“Their Saint Crystals and Pills were finished, and they took everything I had,” Yang Kai said with an angry face.

The woman covered her mouth in mock shock, and Liu Shan and the slight man quickly scanned Yang Kai with their divine senses, discovering he indeed carried no Secret Treasure. They accepted his story as truth.

They all knew the cultivation of the He sisters, and as a First Stage of the Saint Realm cultivator, Yang Kai was obviously no match for them.

So Yang Kai’s story held up without glaring contradictions.

“When we find them, you can deal with them however you like,” the woman said, looping her arm through Yang Kai’s and breathing in his ear like perfume. Her ample breasts were slightly compressed by his elbow as her body pressed against him, heating up.

“Really?” Yang Kai beamed, his expression lascivious.

“Really. We’ll torment them together!” the woman nodded with a smile. “That’s exactly the sort of thing I love doing.”

The slight man chortled cruelly, “Of course—assuming you live that long. Kid, if I were you I’d rather be killed now than go back with her.”

“Liusha, if you don’t speak, no one will mistake you for a mute.” The beautiful woman shot the scrawny man a vicious glare.

Liu Sha shrugged and fell silent.

“Is going back with you really that dangerous?” Yang Kai turned to the woman with a shameless grin, as if death were a foreign word. He prodded her impressive chest with his elbow.

At such close range, if he exploded with full force the woman would have no chance of survival, but he didn’t act rashly. He judged that although these three were no good, following them was at least a way to leave the Chaos Abyss.

That was what Yang Kai wanted most right now, so he held his actions in check.

“Why would it be dangerous?” the woman laughed, “Not only is there no danger, Sister will give you an experience you’ll never forget.”

“Then I’ll wait and see,” Yang Kai nodded.
