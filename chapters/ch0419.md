## Chapter 419 — Someone Coming to Surrender?

Just as with Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian that day, as soon as the Pills were in hand, the two Blood Servants immediately noticed that the Pills Yang Kai produced were merely Upper-Level Earth-Grade grade. Though they were medicinal Pills for healing, the quality was pitifully low. Could such Pills really have any significant effect?

Suspicion stirred in their hearts, yet not a trace of it showed on their faces.

“Time is tight. You two should quickly consume and refine the Pills’ effects. Tonight, a grand act awaits your entrance,” Yang Kai’s gaze ran deep, the corners of his mouth quirked into a blade-like smirk. “I want to see who dares make the first move against me!”

“Yes!” Both nodded, well aware that tonight would not be peaceful. Without delay, they prepared to consume the Pills. Suddenly, Yang Kai’s expression turned cold; he turned to look outside and chuckled softly, “It’s not even nightfall yet, and already someone wants to cause trouble?”

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu blinked in surprise but quickly reacted, releasing their Divine Sense. Sure enough, outside the mansion, many people had gathered. While anger flared within, astonishment was plain on both their faces.

Because Yang Kai had sensed them before they did!

The trio occupied a deeper chamber within the mansion, roughly a thousand zhang from the main entrance. Any disturbance outside should not have been able to reach there.

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu wondered how Yang Kai could have detected this.

The number of the arrivals was not large, and their strength wasn’t too imposing. Still, there were at least a few Divine Roaming Realm practitioners among them.

“I shall go deal with them first,” Qu Gaoyi volunteered.

“No rush,” Yang Kai frowned. “Qiu Yimeng has come.”

Before his words finished, the voice of the Qiu Family’s eldest daughter sounded outside the door: “Yang Kai, someone’s here to see you.”

Yang Kai and the two Blood Servants exchanged looks of confusion.

Opening the door, they saw Qiu Yimeng standing outside with a gentle smile, elegant and graceful. The Blood Servants were momentarily dazzled, silently admiring that despite such disadvantage, Yang Kai still had such a beauty’s support.

“What sort of person?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

Qiu Yimeng shook her head slowly. “I don’t know. A young man. I reckon he’s come to surrender to you. But his demeanor is somewhat odd. Do you want to see for yourself?”

“You couldn’t tell from his cultivation level?” Yang Kai was somewhat surprised.

“He won’t say himself, how would I know?” Qiu Yimeng rolled her eyes.

“Not a fat guy, right?” Yang Kai suddenly recalled Dong Qinghan. But he had clearly told Dong Qinghan not to appear today. That fellow’s personality wouldn’t be so reckless.

“Not fat. Still, you should check.”

Yang Kai nodded. Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu prepared to follow, but Yang Kai stopped them.

“You two focus on healing. No need to come.”

“But...” Qu Gaoyi hesitated, unwilling to leave his guard down.

“The strength of those outside is nothing to me,” Yang Kai said confidently, stepping outside. Behind him, Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu exchanged glances, their expressions stirring.

Though his words sounded ordinary, careful consideration revealed hidden significance.

This young master seemed to already know what strength those outside possessed!

How could he know? He was only at the eighth stage of the True Essence Realm, far from Divine Roaming Realm, and had not cultivated Divine Sense.

By his own perception, it was impossible to discern such details.

And even if he did know, why claim that those people could not affect him? Such inexplicable confidence surprised Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu most of all.

Remember, a few of those outside were Divine Roaming Realm masters.

Exchanging a look, the pair saw the shock mirrored in each other’s eyes.

Walking out with Qiu Yimeng, the young lady smiled and glanced sideways at Yang Kai. “You don’t seem the least bit anxious.”

“Why be anxious?” Yang Kai returned her gaze.

“You’re pretending to play dumb with me!” Qiu Yimeng bit her lip gently, grabbing Yang Kai’s sleeve to stop him. She huffed, “By now, you should at least be honest with me.”

“Honest? I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Yang Kai frowned.

“How many allies and forces can you rely on? How do you plan to survive tonight’s crisis?” Qiu Yimeng asked directly, knowing if she didn’t inquire, Yang Kai would merely equivocate. Her tone softened somewhat, “I’m your ally now, even if not officially representing the Qiu Family. Though my support is limited, I’ve already come this far. Why keep deceiving me? Am I not worthy of your genuine trust?”

“Genuine trust?” Yang Kai gave a strange smile, appraising Qiu Yimeng from head to toe, his eyes flickering with a hint of lust. “And how exactly do you wish to trust me so truly?”

Noticing the aggressive gleam in his eyes and the double meaning in his words, Qiu Yimeng blushed but quickly regained composure. “Wouldn’t it be nice to be your confidante? If troubles weigh on you, you could tell me—I’m here to talk and listen.”

“No need. I only share love affairs with women. Talking and chatting is too shallow for me,” Yang Kai said earnestly.

“You never say a serious word around me! Am I really so disagreeable?” Qiu Yimeng was flustered, her bosom swelling as she pouted. “Though you’re extraordinary and outstanding—the most powerful young man I’ve ever met—I don’t want to fight with some temptress queen type. I know I’m no match!”

“You’re not annoying me; you’re too clever. Being around you means I have to be cautious everywhere,” Yang Kai replied coldly.

Qiu Yimeng paused, fluttering her long lashes, then suddenly covered her mouth with a laugh. “So I cause you pressure? I always thought the pressure was all on me.”

“You seriously underestimate yourself.”

“Don’t know why, but my mood just improved a lot,” Qiu Yimeng smiled radiantly, seemingly pleased to think she could make Yang Kai so cautious.

“I won’t say much else. Just watch tonight closely,” Yang Kai grinned confidently.

“You do have plans,” Qiu Yimeng said with a hum. “You made me worry for nothing.”

Knowing she spoke sweet lies to curry favor, Yang Kai did not reply. He stepped forward.

Without warning, Huo Xingchen appeared like a specter from nowhere, shaking a folding fan in hand, striking a debonair pose as he followed the two, smiling. “Hey, I hear some noise outside?”

“Your ears are sharp!” Qiu Yimeng glared at him.

Huo Xingchen chuckled, “I love a good show—especially when it’s enemies clashing. Tell me, is someone here to cause trouble for Yang Kai?”

“Not exactly trouble,” Qiu Yimeng’s expression turned serious. “That person’s attitude is strange—like surrender, but not quite. He brought some capable people with him and several large scarlet boxes.”

“Fuck!” Huo Xingchen blurted, eyes wide as he stared at Yang Kai in disbelief. “With your looks, someone actually wants to surrender to you? Are they blind or have they given up on life?”

“Shut up!” Qiu Yimeng chided him. Huo Xingchen seemed a bit scared of the elder lady and immediately closed his mouth, shaking the folding fan.

“Be wary. Don’t fall for any schemes!” Qiu Yimeng warned Yang Kai. “I don’t want to see you destroyed.”

She had effectively come out from the Qiu Family to ally with Yang Kai. If he were to fall to some small trick, it would prove how shortsighted she was.

Outside the door stood a young man in a black robe, tall and robust, hands behind his back. Behind him, at least twenty martial artists stood in a line. Among them were four Divine Roaming Realm masters, though the strongest was only at the Fourth Stage. 

A fourth stage Divine Roaming Realm from a top-tier noble clan was respectable but still somewhat modest in pedigree.

What caught attention were the many scarlet boxes they carried.

The contents were unknown; some felt light, others heavy. A faint scent of medicinal Pills permeated the air.

There were as many as four of these scarlet boxes, lined neatly to one side.

The young man’s gaze was steadfast, his expression calm. The twenty stood silently, all watching Yang Kai’s residence with impassive faces.

After a moment, Yang Kai, Huo Xingchen, and Qiu Yimeng stepped out together.

Squinting, the young man’s gaze flicked between Huo Xingchen and Yang Kai, confused, unable to tell which was Yang Kai.

Yang Kai himself was puzzled. He had expected Dong Qinghan, but this was not him. Moreover, he didn’t know this man at all!

For a stranger to come surrender to him was simply unreasonable.

Everyone with eyes could see this succession war was nearly unwinnable for Yang Kai. Tonight’s first real test of survival was imminent.

Their purpose, at this critical moment, was suspicious indeed.

But if they weren’t here to surrender, why bring so many scarlet boxes filled with goods?

Yang Kai shook his head inwardly, perplexed.

Qiu Yimeng had warned caution, and Yang Kai would not be careless.

Before he could ask, Huo Xingchen suddenly flicked open his folding fan, waving it gently as he smiled and asked, “Which sect are you disciples of?”

The young man immediately turned his gaze toward Huo Xingchen. Seeing his rakish appearance, he frowned in disdain, coldness rising in his eyes. “Are you the youngest Young Master Yang Kai?”

Huo Xingchen’s demeanor only deepened the man’s disappointment, and his tone was naturally blunt.

Huo Xingchen chuckled, “Just from your dull look, I can tell you’re poorly informed. Want me to enlighten you a bit?”

Without waiting for a response, he continued, “After tonight, this place will have a new master. You should just turn around and go back where you came from. When choosing whom to surrender to, you should open your eyes wide. Among the eight Young Masters of the Yang Family, you pick this one? You’re hopeless.”
