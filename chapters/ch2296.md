## Chapter 2296 — Heart Palpitations

"A chance meeting is better than a planned one, Ye'er, how about we enter the city together? I acquired a fine pot of Carbon Blood Black Tea at the start of the month and have been looking for someone to share it with. Would you do me the honor?" Qiu Yu turned, smiling as he invited Ye Qinghan.

Ye Qinghan replied coldly, “Our paths are different, so we cannot walk together!”

With that, she called out to Du Xian and the others, “Senior Brother, let’s go!”

Du Xian nodded lightly, like a victorious general, and smiled at Qiu Yu, “Young Master Qiu, keep that black tea for yourself. Don’t choke on it!”

“Heh, thanks for your concern, Brother Du!” Qiu Yu replied with a smile, unfazed.

In no time, the Thousand Leaves Sect group entered the city together. Qiu Yu seemed to lose interest and, with the two elders, disappeared into the crowd inside the city.

“Who is that Qiu Yu? He seems pretty impressive,” Yang Kai asked curiously after entering the city.

Ye Qinghan sighed, “He’s the Young Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace. Tianzhao Palace has always been at odds with our Thousand Leaves Sect, trying to push us out but never finding the chance. But I’ve heard that the Palace Master, Qiu Ze, is currently in seclusion, trying to break through to the Emperor Realm. If he really succeeds…”

At this, Ye Qinghan’s face showed worry.

Du Xian said, “Tianhe City is now in cahoots with Tianzhao Palace. If Qiu Ze really advances to the Emperor Realm, our Thousand Leaves Sect’s future will be bleak.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai suddenly understood. Tianhe City’s new backer must be Tianzhao Palace.

Wuma said, “The Emperor Realm isn’t so easy to break through. Maybe that old bastard Qiu Ze will die from Qi Deviation at the critical moment.”

Everyone could tell he was cursing, but since Qiu Ze dared to attempt the breakthrough, he must be confident. If he really succeeds, Thousand Leaves Sect will be in trouble.

“Master will handle this. We just need to do our part,” Du Xian quickly comforted his fellow disciples, seeing their spirits low.

In Tianhe City, in front of a shop called ‘Heaven Puppet Tower,’ the Thousand Leaves Sect group stopped.

Ye Qinghan explained to Yang Kai, “This is our Thousand Leaves Sect’s largest business in Tianhe City. If you don’t mind, Young Master Yang, you can stay here for a couple of days. After tomorrow’s concubine ceremony, I’ll accompany you back to the Sect.”

“Alright,” Yang Kai said, looking at the grand and luxuriously decorated Heaven Puppet Tower, nodding slightly.

It was clear this place used to be bustling, built in such a prime location. Business must have been booming, with customers coming and going like a river.

But times had changed. Now Heaven Puppet Tower was deserted, shelves covered in dust, and only a few goods left. A servant dressed as a shop boy was napping behind the counter, grinning foolishly in his sleep, drooling from the corner of his mouth.

“Business is… pretty bleak,” Yang Kai sighed.

Ye Qinghan gave a bitter smile, "If thugs block your shop every day using the City Lord’s name to pressure customers, no one would buy anything."

Hearing this, Yang Kai noticed a few burly men with fierce faces standing not far from Heaven Puppet Tower, watching the entrance with cold smiles, ready to act at any moment. But when they saw the Thousand Leaves Sect insignia on Ye Qinghan and the others, their expressions changed and they looked away.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Your Sect’s situation in Tianhe City is really not ideal.”

Ye Qinghan’s face dimmed, “The circumstances are against us… Young Master Yang, please come inside.”

Yang Kai nodded and, led by Ye Qinghan, entered the shop.

Du Xian and Wuma exchanged confused glances. Along the way, they’d noticed how much Ye Qinghan valued Yang Kai, treating him like an honored guest, always respectful. But no matter how they looked at it, Yang Kai was just a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator. They couldn’t figure out why Ye Qinghan was so cautious with him.

But now wasn’t the time to ask. They entered the shop, and Wuma strode to the counter, knocking to wake the sleeping shop boy.

The shop boy, likely a Thousand Leaves Sect disciple of low rank and cultivation, saw Ye Qinghan and the others and was so frightened he turned pale, bowing his head and apologizing repeatedly.

Ye Qinghan impatiently waved her hand, “Tell the Shopkeeper to prepare a few top rooms.”

“Yes, yes, I’ll go call the Shopkeeper right away. Please wait a moment, Young Lady.” The shop boy, relieved, hurried off to the back.

Soon, a middle-aged man came out from the back, greeted Ye Qinghan and the others, and led them to the rear to settle in.

The concubine ceremony was tomorrow, so there was nothing to do today. After settling Yang Kai in, Ye Qinghan returned to her own room. After a while, she heard a gentle knock at the door.

She stepped lightly to open the door and saw Du Xian standing there with a bright smile. Her face flushed, and after a moment’s shyness, she welcomed him in, exchanging sweet words.

…

In his room, Yang Kai sat in meditation.

Coming to Tianhe City with Ye Qinghan was just a coincidence, so he decided to go with the flow.

But for some reason, he felt restless today, as if something was about to happen, making it impossible to calm his mind.

This was the first time he’d ever felt this way while cultivating.

He didn’t dare be careless, repeatedly scanning himself with Divine Sense, afraid he’d made a mistake in cultivation or developed inner demons.

But no matter how many times he checked, he found nothing wrong. Instead, the feeling of unease only grew stronger.

Frowning, he realized this sensation had started as soon as he entered Tianhe City. It was as if something in the city was affecting him.

The feeling was inexplicable, but Yang Kai didn’t dare ignore it. At his level, only external forces could disturb his inner peace.

Unable to figure it out, he sighed and stood up.

He wanted to greet Ye Qinghan and tell her he was going out for a walk, but as soon as he released his Divine Sense, he sensed Ye Qinghan and Du Xian in their room, lost in each other’s affection, and his face darkened.

The two weren’t doing anything outrageous—Du Xian just held Ye Qinghan’s jade hand, gazing at her lovingly and speaking of longing, while Ye Qinghan lowered her head, cheeks flushed, her slender neck pink and glowing like porcelain.

Yang Kai quickly withdrew his Divine Sense, afraid he’d see something he shouldn’t.

Without saying anything to the others, Yang Kai slipped out of Heaven Puppet Tower and soon found himself on the bustling street.

Tianhe City was considered a mid-sized city in the Southern Territory, so its layout and scale far surpassed Fenglin City. The wide streets could fit eight horses side by side, and martial artists crowded the thoroughfares, shoulder to shoulder, coming and going endlessly.

Shops lined both sides of the street, and the cries of vendors rang out one after another.

Maybe because tomorrow was the City Lord’s concubine ceremony, the whole city was festive, lanterns and decorations everywhere, lively and bustling. The martial artists all wore happy expressions, though it was unclear what they were so pleased about.

Yang Kai drifted with the crowd and soon arrived at a restaurant. Seeing it packed with guests, he went inside.

Immediately, a friendly shop boy greeted him. This shop boy was also a martial artist, though only at the Saint Realm, and he smiled as he bowed to Yang Kai, “Please come in, sir. You look unfamiliar—are you here to meet someone or drinking alone?”

Yang Kai glanced at him and smiled, “Alone.”

The shop boy smiled knowingly, “I understand, sir. Please, have a seat!”

He led Yang Kai to the third floor and seated him by a window. “What would you like to eat or drink, sir? Not to boast, but there are few places in Tianhe City that can match our restaurant. All our ingredients are fresh from demonic beasts, spirit flowers, and fruits. For someone of your cultivation, regular consumption can improve your strength and foundation. With luck, you might even break through on the spot! It’s happened here a few times.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brows in surprise, smiling. “What do you think I should have, given my cultivation?”

The shop boy chuckled, “Sir, you’re clearly a Dao Origin Realm expert, so you deserve the finest ingredients and best wine. If you have a beauty to accompany you, all the better.”

This shop boy had sharp eyes from years of serving guests. Even with only Saint Realm cultivation, he could tell Yang Kai was Dao Origin Realm, and he was quick-tongued and pleasant, making him well-liked.

Yang Kai laughed, “Alright, you arrange it.”

The shop boy’s face lit up, “I’ll make sure you’re satisfied. If not, you can break my bones and make soup!”

Yang Kai nodded, “Good. If I’m even a little dissatisfied, I’ll do as you say!”

The shop boy’s face darkened, “Then I’d better do my best.”

With that, he hurried off to make arrangements.

While waiting, Yang Kai sat by the window, watching the scene below. He found it quite interesting, and all the anxiety he’d felt before seemed to vanish.
