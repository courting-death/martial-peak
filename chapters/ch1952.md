## Chapter 1952 — Third Stage of the Void King Realm and a New Secret Art

Deep within the Ice Cliff, a hundred zhang down, the Spatial Power inside the cave fluctuated wildly, manifesting into a clearly discernible Domain Field that enveloped the entire grotto.

Crackling sounds rang out as the space around Yang Kai became unstable.

Thin spatial fissures leisurely formed one after another, like nimble fish swimming through water, only to be erased by the self-repair of the laws of heaven and earth, repeating in endless cycles.

As time went on, those hairline spatial fissures began to join, forming dreadfully ominous veins through the void. The surrounding space looked as if a razor had sliced a piece of cloth—countless scars crisscrossing in chaotic disorder. Waves of turbulent spatial force flickered and raced about, carving the small grotto into a battered ruin, sending fragments of stone flying in all directions.

At the same time, dazzling starlight abruptly appeared across his body.

Tiny motes of starlight, like fireflies, dotted his skin.
These specks of starlight were the remnants of what he had absorbed earlier in the Starlight Passage—unable to fuse into his flesh, they had been stored in his Sea of Consciousness.

Affected by Yang Kai’s breakthrough, the starry light surged forth on its own, acting as a miraculous catalyst that drove his Saint Yuan to convert toward Origin Qi.

If anyone stood nearby at that moment, they would likely see at a glance that Yang Kai was of Star Lord origin; his current portent was far too obvious to not draw such a conclusion.

A flowing, mighty force burst from within him like a sweeping tsunami, and Yang Kai was completely unaware, lost as he was in the comprehension and condensation of Spatial Power.

One by one, spatial black holes large and small formed around him—direct manifestations of his Secret Art, Exile.

Pitch-black crescent-shaped attacks shot out, splashing in all directions; this was the effect of the Moon Blade.

As for his cultivation of Spatial Power, the two Secret Arts he had personally comprehended had now reached the moment of condensation.

From his lower abdomen came the metallic clink of gold and iron; something was suddenly being born there, into which all of Yang Kai’s lifetime of insight and understanding of Spatial Power condensed.

The Void Mind Crystal thundered into being!

At the same time, Yang Kai’s aura abruptly surged upward.

Crack! Crack! Crack!...

The Source Crystals he had previously arranged around him were drawn by some mysterious force and suddenly exploded in great numbers; dense Heaven-and-Earth Energy flooded the cave. Yang Kai’s body seemed to become a bottomless pit, ravenously devouring and accepting that Heaven-and-Earth Energy as it poured into his form.

The shackles that had pinned him to the apex of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm were shattered in an instant, allowing Yang Kai’s cultivation to smoothly reach the next Stage.

But that was not all. The pure energy contained within the shattered Source Crystals continued to be absorbed by him, stabilizing his current cultivation and making his foundation even firmer.

Yet Yang Kai himself did not place his mind on his cultivation level; all his attention remained immersed in the comprehension of Spatial Power.

He suddenly realized that the previously obscure aspects of Spatial Power he had wrestled with now yielded a fresh understanding.

Another entirely new Secret Art vaguely surfaced in his mind.

Joy surged within him, but his face remained impassive as he concentrated more intensely, determined to pierce the bottleneck that blocked his comprehension and let this new Secret Art emerge.

Time flew by, and soon a month and a half had passed.

During that period Yang Kai had not moved an inch; the thirty thousand Source Crystals arrayed beside him had long since been consumed, and his cultivation had stabilized at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. Although not all of his Saint Yuan had yet converted into Origin Qi, such a thing could not be completed in an instant and required accumulation over time.

But when he opened his eyes again, he felt that he was in some way different from before.

Within his eyes there flickered the power of the void, creation and annihilation weaving together; with every gesture, space itself seemed to bend and ripple.

"Is this the new Secret Art?" Yang Kai murmured, and with a thought his entire person suddenly vanished from sight.

This was not spatial teleportation, for Yang Kai himself had not moved at all and still sat cross-legged where he had been; yet if one scanned him with Divine Sense, they would find no sign of his existence. At his present Third Stage of the Void King Realm level, the use of this Secret Art was enough to deceive ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivators.

With the naked eye one could still faintly perceive a transparent silhouette, motionless like ripples in water.

This was a concealment Secret Art.

Yang Kai had fused himself with the void and uniquely created a concealment Secret Art.

After a moment's contemplation, Yang Kai grinned and said, "I'll call it Nothingness!"

Unlike Exile and Moon Blade, the Nothingness Secret Art was not meant for combat but for concealment; in some respects its rarity exceeded Exile and Moon Blade, because preserving one’s life was the prerequisite for fighting another day.

However, Yang Kai vaguely sensed that Nothingness did not only possess concealment; it also had another function.

How effective that additional function would be still required testing.

Having secluded himself for over a month and achieved all his intended goals, Yang Kai felt very pleased; he closed his eyes and began to probe his own state.

Sending his Divine Sense down into his lower abdomen, Yang Kai soon discovered a hexagonal crystal in his Dantian—the Void Mind Crystal—an embodiment of all his insights into Spatial Power.

To be blunt, if someone else obtained this Void Mind Crystal and fully comprehended the secrets it contained, they would certainly acquire Yang Kai’s understanding of Spatial Power and be able to use all of his Secret Arts.

That was Yang Kai’s most precious treasure at present.

It was not his first time seeing a Void Mind Crystal. Years ago he had unearthed one in the Flowing Flame Sandland, unaware of its value; it was later confirmed to be the Void Mind Crystal of the Insect Emperor, though it was swallowed by the Warm Spirit Lotus and instantly caused the lotus to evolve into a seven‑colored form. He had also found Yao King Feng E’s Void Mind Crystal in the Blood Prison on Cuiwei Star, and later still obtained another from the Treasure Vault of Purple Star.

The Void Mind Crystal’s shape seemed roughly the same each time: a hexagonal crystal, though their colors differed greatly.

Regardless of what color other people’s Void Mind Crystals were, Yang Kai’s was pitch-black, as if capable of devouring everything.

That color fit his Spatial Power well, pleasing Yang Kai more and more as he gazed at it.

Drawing his attention back inward, Yang Kai checked his cultivation and the proportion of his Saint Yuan that had been converted into Origin Qi.

As for cultivation, it went without saying: having condensed his Void Mind Crystal already meant Yang Kai had risen to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

It was the conversion of Origin Qi that left Yang Kai dissatisfied!

Only half converted! Although he had been focusing on condensing the Void Mind Crystal, he knew his own situation well; the starlight in his Sea of Consciousness had actively emerged to act as a catalyst for converting Saint Yuan, and he could detect that.

Yet now the starlight in his Sea of Consciousness was almost exhausted, and his Saint Yuan still had not been fully converted into Origin Qi, which vexed him greatly.

This was because he did not understand the circumstances of the Star Realm.

Had he known that even for a Star Lord, after absorbing sufficient starlight within the Starlight Passage and entering the Star Realm it still took years to completely convert all their power, he would not have been so impatient.

For example, Yin Lesheng spent five years in the Starlight Passage to convert all of his power into Origin Qi.

He was also a Star Lord expert!

Ai Ou was likewise a Star Lord; barring accidents, five to six years would be the minimum conversion time.

Those who came from low-level Star Domains and were not Star Lords fared worse—ten or so years was normal; twenty or thirty years was possible; even forty or fifty years would not be unusual.

For Void King Realm cultivators, decades of time were actually not much.

Conversion of Origin Qi made a cultivator steadily stronger, so even if the Realm did not change, a cultivator’s effective power could gradually increase.

Yet Yang Kai had spent less than three months and already converted more than half his power—an almost incomprehensible speed, unprecedented in history.

Compared to one and a half months earlier, Yang Kai’s strength had increased by more than double; after all, his cultivation had advanced a Stage and the proportion of Origin Qi conversion had risen significantly.

"The starlight catalyst in the Sea of Consciousness is nearly used up; how will I continue converting Origin Qi? Ah… I heard recently there is a kind of pill, Source Condensing Pill, whose effect is similar to starlight—maybe I should refine some of those," Yang Kai said to himself, rubbing his chin.

The Source Condensing Pill, as its name implied, was specifically used to convert a cultivator’s Saint Yuan into Origin Qi; only Void King Realm cultivators could take it. It was a Void King-Grade Upper-Level Spiritual Pill. Though its effect could not match starlight, it was the auxiliary pill Void King cultivators most often chose.

But Yang Kai had only heard of the pill’s name; he did not have the pill recipe and did not know what materials were needed to refine it.

He privately decided that after this period of seclusion he would go to the marketplace to investigate, see if he could collect the Source Condensing Pill’s recipe, and gather other pill formulas as well; the Star Realm’s prescriptions were abundant and far beyond what his home Star Domain possessed. Gathering some now would be prudent—he might need them someday.

Yet gathering pill formulas required a lot of Source Crystals, and thinking of the empty Spatial Ring made Yang Kai’s head throb.

He had never expected that, though he had been immensely wealthy in the Star Domain, he would arrive in the Star Realm and be so poor.

Putting away the jumble of thoughts in his mind, Yang Kai stood up.

As he rose, the thin frost layer that had formed on his surface flaked and fell away; Yang Kai casually brushed it off, then suddenly frowned before his expression brightened.

He discovered that his resistance to the surrounding cold was far stronger than before.

He had chosen this location to carve out a cave because he could barely withstand the harsh environment here and wanted to temper his will.

But now he found that the surrounding severe cold could no longer affect him at all, clearly because his strength had increased and his resistance to the harsh environment had been greatly enhanced.
