## Chapter 2268 — Source Crystal Eruption

Of the eighteen Spirit Sources, only the one occupied by Yang Kai remained peaceful.

Everyone had already witnessed Yang Kai’s ferocious methods before, so who would dare compete with him for anything? They all took the initiative to avoid provoking this fiend.

Yang Kai was more than happy with this arrangement.

He paid no attention to the battles at the other Spirit Sources. Instead, with a thought, he sent a message to Liu Yan, instructing her to bring Hua Qingsi and the others over.

After doing this, his figure flickered as he rushed toward the Spirit Spring Source, plunging straight into the spring’s eye.

In the next instant, Yang Kai felt himself surrounded by Spiritual Qi so dense it was almost viscous. The sensation of that Qi pouring into his body made him feel utterly comfortable, unable to restrain himself. The realm he had just broken through—the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—actually showed signs of stabilizing in a short time.

Overjoyed, Yang Kai quickly formed a hand seal and began absorbing madly.

At the same time, he took out the Xuan Realm Pearl, flicked his finger, and opened a rift on its surface, exposing the Small Xuan Realm and allowing the Xuan Realm Pearl to absorb the Spiritual Qi.

But soon, Yang Kai frowned, focusing his gaze downward. His eyes flashed with a sharp light, as if he could pierce through space and time.

Vaguely, he seemed to see something shooting out along with the eruption of the Spirit Spring Source. It was moving at an astonishing speed, and the sound of it tearing through the air whistled past his ears.

“Not good!” Yang Kai’s heart sank. He didn’t know what exactly was being ejected from the Spirit Spring Source, but he sensed an extremely dangerous aura. He hurriedly activated his Origin Qi, forming a protective layer over his body, and tried to dart away.

But it was already too late.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Boom, boom, boom…

One after another, mysterious objects crashed out at inconceivable speed, slamming into Yang Kai. Each impact was like a meteor falling from the sky.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s whole body ached. Using the force of the collisions, he shot out of the Spirit Source.

Hot on his heels, streaks of white light followed, scattering like a sky full of stars.

“What the hell are these things!” Yang Kai’s expression was full of shock and uncertainty. He dodged to the side and focused his gaze to observe carefully.

Very quickly, his expression became brilliant and varied.

Because he discovered that the things shooting out from beneath the Spirit Source and slamming into him were actually fist-sized Source Crystals!

Judging by the color and purity of these Source Crystals, the lowest among them were Middle-Level Source Crystals, and there was even a large number of Upper-Level Source Crystals mixed in.

Yang Kai’s eyes bulged, his gaze burning with intensity.

Throughout the entire Star Realm, the basic currency for transactions and trade between cultivators was Lower-Level Source Crystals. For example, last time at Qingyang Shrine, Gao Xueting had him pay ten million for that Formless Profound Grass, which also referred to Lower-Level Source Crystals. Converted, that would be only one hundred thousand Middle-Level Source Crystals or a thousand Upper-Level Source Crystals.

The Source Crystals Yang Kai had obtained so far were mostly Lower-Level, with few Middle-Level, and as for Upper-Level, they were extremely rare.

Upper-Level Source Crystals were not easy to come by. Only the best Source Crystal lodes would produce Upper-Level Source Crystals.

And those best lodes were always controlled by major forces. Once mined, they were basically consumed internally by the sect, rarely circulating to the outside world.

The higher the grade of a Source Crystal, the greater its use. Many sect grand formations and even cultivator breakthroughs required Upper-Level Source Crystals.

Yet here and now, from this Spirit Spring Source, a huge number of Middle-Level and Upper-Level Source Crystals were erupting. How could Yang Kai not be shocked?

While he was still in a daze, the other seventeen Spirit Sources erupted as well.

A torrent of Source Crystals burst out from beneath the springs, carried by the surging Spiritual Qi. For a moment, the whistling sound was endless, and the sky was filled with shimmering white light.

Some cultivators, caught off guard, were struck by the Source Crystals and couldn’t help but grunt, blood seeping from the corners of their mouths. The force of the impact was clear to see.

But in just a moment, all the cultivators at the underground spring were in an uproar.

“Source Crystals! Upper-Level Source Crystals!”

“There are actually Upper-Level Source Crystals under this Spirit Source! Hahaha, we’ve struck it rich this time!”

“Get lost! This spring is ours. If you don’t know what’s good for you, don’t blame my Senior Brother and me for forgetting the ties between our sects!”

“What a joke! Treasures belong to the worthy. You lot think you can hog it all? If you want to die, I’ll oblige you!”

“Refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit? I’ll fight you all—waaah!”

The appearance of the eighteen springs had already made the scene chaotic, and now with so many Source Crystals erupting, the cultivators went completely mad.

After all, the springs themselves couldn’t be taken away. Everyone knew that before word got out, they could only cultivate here for a while. But Source Crystals were different—they could be taken, and they were hard currency throughout the Star Realm. A single Upper-Level Source Crystal was worth ten thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals. Judging by the number erupting, just occupying a spring for a few days would be enough to double a sect’s wealth.

In an instant, the sects and families already fighting each other became even more unwilling to yield. Even those who had been on good terms now looked at each other with a hint of hostility.

For wealth, people die; for food, birds perish. An eternal truth.

“Yang Kai!” As Yang Kai looked around, Hua Qingsi had already brought Zhang Ruoxi, Liu Yan, and Qin Chaoyang over, landing at his side. At the sight of this spectacle, Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes trembled in shock, her small hand covering her red lips as she stammered, “This… what happened here?!”

Yang Kai grinned, “The Spirit Spring Source erupted, spewing out Source Crystals everywhere—what do you think happened?”

Zhang Ruoxi was still young and inexperienced. Seeing such a grand scene for the first time, her little face turned pale with shock.

Qin Chaoyang nearly popped his eyes out, his hands and feet trembling as he stared at the spring and the Source Crystals, dumbfounded for a long while.

“Ruoxi, don’t worry about anything else. Find a safe place to cultivate. Liu Yan will protect you.” As Yang Kai spoke, he shot Liu Yan a look. She understood, pulled Zhang Ruoxi aside, and sat down near the Upper-Level Spirit Source.

Whenever a Source Crystal shot over, Liu Yan simply reached out and caught it.

Seeing this, Yang Kai tossed Liu Yan a Spatial Ring, then said to Hua Qingsi, “Put cultivation aside for now. Come with me to collect Source Crystals!”

“Alright!” Hua Qingsi nodded. With a graceful movement, she followed Yang Kai to hover above the spring.

At this moment, Source Crystals were erupting endlessly from the spring below. Yang Kai stood in midair, spread his hand wide, and over a hundred Golden Blood Threads shot out, weaving into a golden net that spanned above the spring.

Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle…

All the erupting Source Crystals were blocked by the golden net, their momentum slowed. Hua Qingsi seized the opportunity, forming hand seals and flicking her fingers. With a pull and a tug, she collected the Source Crystals and stuffed them into the Spatial Ring.

Working together, the two didn’t let a single Source Crystal escape; all were blocked and collected.

"It seems there’s nothing left for me to do here…" Qin Chaoyang watched for a moment, the corner of his mouth twitching. "Brother Yang, you keep busy; I’ll go see what I can scrounge up elsewhere!"

With such a great opportunity, if he could amass a fortune, it would surely become the foundation for the Qin Family’s resurgence. But with Yang Kai occupying this spring, there was nothing left for him to do, so he naturally had to look elsewhere.

Scanning the area, Qin Chaoyang grinned, then moved over to the Middle-Level Spirit Source where Duan Yuanshan and the others were. He cupped his fists and said, “City Lord Duan, fellow old friends, Qin greets you all…”

“Old man, you’re just here to pick up scraps?” The Du Family Head, Du Lishen, glared at him.

The Zhou Family Head, Zhou Yi, snorted, “Qin, you old thief, you sure know how to talk out of your ass. Who taught you that?”

“Watch your mouth!” Qin Chaoyang was immediately displeased, his beard bristling as he snapped, “You two shameless old coots, believe it or not, I’ll beat you so badly your mothers won’t recognize you!”

Zhou Yi and Du Lishen exchanged a glance and burst out laughing, “If your mother were still alive, would she even recognize you?”

Qin Chaoyang’s old face turned black.

“Enough nonsense. Since you’re here, hurry up and help. Can’t you see the Source Crystals are flying everywhere?” Duan Yuanshan waved his hand and barked.

“City Lord Duan has spoken, so I must obey!” Qin Chaoyang grinned and eagerly joined the group.

The various Family Heads were all from Fenglin City and had known each other for many years. Though there may have been minor frictions in the past, now that outsiders were invading and powerful enemies were watching, everyone instinctively wanted to band together. So even as they teased each other, it didn’t affect their camaraderie.

“Hey, Zhou Yi, you old rascal, you actually managed to break through to the Second Stage. Heaven must be blind.” After collecting Source Crystals for a while and seeing things settle down, Qin Chaoyang suddenly noticed that the Zhou Family Head had advanced just like him.

“What’s that supposed to mean!” Zhou Yi glared, “If you can break through, why can’t I?”

“Looks like everyone’s broken through.” Du Lishen chuckled.

Only then did Qin Chaoyang check the others’ cultivation and found that everyone had advanced a Stage. All the Family Head friends had reached the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, as had the Drunken Old Man, while Duan Yuanshan had reached the Third Stage!

“Ah, congratulations to you all!” Qin Chaoyang laughed heartily.

“Likewise, likewise!” Duan Yuanshan chuckled. “With this, our Fenglin City is now a considerable force. As the saying goes, brothers may quarrel within, but unite against outsiders. I hope everyone can work together from now on.”

If all the Family Heads gathered together, plus Duan Yuanshan and the Drunken Old Man, this force would indeed be impressive—at least comparable to some mid-tier sects and families. The only thing missing was an Emperor Realm expert to hold the fort.

But Emperor Realm experts were rare. Even those mid-tier families and sects might not have such experts.

Hearing Duan Yuanshan’s words, everyone’s expressions grew solemn, and they all nodded in agreement.
