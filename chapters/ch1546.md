## Chapter 1546 — Lushui City

He wanted to go and see if he could find Su Yan there!

Thinking this, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense from his Sea of Consciousness and poured it into the Star Chart before him, carving out the warship's course.

For a long stretch after that, he no longer had to worry—the warship would sail along the route he had drawn all the way to the destination, provided, of course, that no danger was encountered along the way.

Time flew.

The warship followed the route Yang Kai had plotted, gliding forward steadily and safely without encountering any significant trouble.

Occasionally a few oddly shaped stellar beasts burst out from nearby dead stars, but the disciples manning the crystal cannons slew them to cinders.

In the cabin, Yang Kai sat cross-legged; in front of him lay the Purple Void Cauldron he had obtained from the Imperial Garden, and all around were boxes and bottles in a dazzling array.

He skillfully dropped herb after herb into the Purple Void Cauldron, pouring his Divine Sense Fire into it to refine the essences, carving spiritual arrays to fuse the essences and make them undergo wondrous transformations.

He precisely controlled the heat and the timing for adding each herb.

Yang Kai was meticulous and took great pleasure in it.

After a while, his brow furrowed and he immediately strengthened the power of his Divine Sense Fire.

The next moment, an explosion rang out from the Purple Void Cauldron, followed by the acrid smell of scorched flesh.

Yang Kai's face showed astonishment, his brow knitted tightly.

Another failure!

He wore an impassive look, lifted the lid of the Purple Void Cauldron, and dumped out a clump of blackened material, piling it to one side.

Over there lay many such clumps—products of Yang Kai's repeated failures at pill refinement!

He did not continue; instead he sank into contemplation.

It had been two years since leaving Dark Star, and Yang Kai had not wasted the time—he had constantly cultivated various arts and probed numerous secret techniques. Besides that, he had been improving his pill-refining skills; his days were extremely full.

Ever since he began to study the way of alchemy, failures had been rare. His success rate in producing pills far exceeded that of ordinary alchemists, and the quality was high, able to draw out the herbs' effects to the utmost.

Such achievements were partly due to his considerable talent in alchemy and partly because he possessed a divine tool for pill refining, the Divine Sense Fire.

Yet in these two years aboard the warship he had experienced failure after failure.

Origin‑Grade upper‑level pills he could now make casually; what he wanted to produce now were Void King‑Grade spiritual pills!

But up to now he had consumed many Void King‑Grade materials and had not produced a single Void King‑Grade pill—everything had been ruined.

The result left him somewhat dispirited.

In any profession, reaching the pinnacle is extremely difficult; within the Star Domain, Void King‑Grade is the summit.

Void King Realm experts were few; countless Origin Returning Realm disciples at the Third Stage were stuck at the bottleneck, never advancing a single inch for their entire lives, and could never glimpse the true meaning of the Martial Dao.

By the same logic, Void King‑Grade alchemists and artificers were even rarer—far fewer in number than Void King Realm experts.

Yang Kai's pill‑refining skills were presently stuck at this bottleneck and could not advance.

He had pondered the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy he had brought from the Imperial Garden, but it did not yield the answer he sought.

He felt his technique and control of the fire were not lacking, yet he simply could not produce a Void King‑Grade pill.

A pill must possess spirit to be called a spiritual pill! There was a line in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy that greatly troubled Yang Kai.

How to make a pill possess spirit—he was utterly at a loss.

Although he had collected many Void King‑Grade herbs, they could not withstand such consumption; Yang Kai considered it and stored away the remaining materials—until he comprehended that line thoroughly, he felt all his efforts would be in vain.

He needed to think carefully.

Taking out the Sun's True Essence and other Five Elements treasures, Yang Kai cultivated the Undying Five Elements Sword while pondering that troublesome sentence from the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

Half a year later, Yang Kai, sitting in the cabin, suddenly opened his eyes.

He felt the warship stop.

Footsteps outside sounded urgent, as if something had happened.

Yang Kai rose, swept a hand, and the door opened; the next moment Qian Yue stood before him.

"We're here!" Qian Yue cried out excitedly.

"Here?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, flickered over, and appeared beside Qian Yue.

He put an arm around her waist and shifted again; the fluctuation of spatial power was obvious. Qian Yue felt a momentary blur before she realized she and Yang Kai were already outside the warship.

Around them lay a cold and vast star domain, with dead stars of various sizes filling the view.

Seeing this scene, Qian Yue felt an intense familiarity.

She had recalled this place countless times in her mind and often replayed the moment she had separated from Ice Lord Qing Ya and the others—she could not be mistaken.

"It's here!" Qian Yue said, voice trembling with excitement. "It's here—there's a Void Passage nearby; we separated after entering the Void Passage!"

Whatever had happened to that Void Passage was unknown, but after Qian Yue entered it she had been sent straight to Dark Star, while Ice Lord Qing Ya and Su Yan had not appeared.

Had she not met Yang Kai by chance, Qian Yue dared not imagine what fate might have befallen her.

Upon entering the Star Domain, she realized how insignificant her power truly was.

"A Void Passage..." Yang Kai murmured, closing his eyes as his Divine Sense expanded outward in a frenzy to probe carefully.

A moment later he opened his eyes and hurriedly flew off in a direction with Qian Yue.

The Lingxiao Sect disciples who had received his message hastened to bring the warship there as well.

After a short while, Yang Kai halted at a patch of void, his gaze grave as he stared ahead.

There, indeed, rolled a very obvious spatial fluctuation; any Divine Sense that probed into it would be immediately devoured.

The Void Passage had completely collapsed and could no longer be used; it would soon vanish from the world entirely. If not for Yang Kai's cultivation of spatial power, it would have been very difficult to locate.

Yang Kai searched carefully while Qian Yue waited tensely, not daring to disturb him.

After a long while, Yang Kai heaved a sigh.

"How is it?" Qian Yue asked anxiously.

Yang Kai shook his head. "From this Void Passage alone we cannot deduce where Su Yan and the others were sent."

The hopeful light in Qian Yue's eyes dimmed at once.

"However...this Void Passage wasn't very powerful; even if it connected two distant spaces, they shouldn't be too far apart. Your appearance on Dark Star was probably due to luck. As for Su Yan and the others... they should have been scattered nearby. Wait here—I will see which cultivation star is nearest; we'll search there."

Saying this, Yang Kai closed his eyes and let his Divine Sense sink into his Sea of Consciousness to probe the star map.

After a while he opened his eyes, returned to the warship with Qian Yue, and ordered the disciples to adjust the ship's course toward a nearby cultivation star.

Several days later a pale blue star came into view; from the starry sky it was not as large as Dark Star—seeming only one quarter of its size.

Yet it was extraordinarily beautiful, and the Heavenly Spiritual Qi there seemed exceptionally abundant.

Undoubtedly, this was a fertile cultivation star.

The warship slowly approached until it reached beyond the atmosphere; Yang Kai then stored the warship inside the Xuan Realm Pearl.

He did not know much about affairs within the Star Domain, but he at least understood that a Void King‑Grade warship was far too conspicuous.

Even the wealthy Hengluo Commerce Guild likely had only a few of such vessels.

If he directly brought the warship down to this star, it would immediately attract attention.

He had come here to look for people and did not wish to stir up trouble.

The weaker disciples also entered the Xuan Realm Pearl; with such an Imperial Treasure, Yang Kai's actions had become much more convenient.

Qian Tong and four others at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, along with Qian Yue, accompanied Yang Kai on a star shuttle to descend to the star.

Half a day later the seven of them set foot upon the beautiful star.

The Heavenly Spiritual Qi here was roughly comparable to that of Dark Star; it was hard to say which was better, but Qian Tong and the others breathed in exaggeratedly, standing there with shifting expressions as if silently sensing something.

Suddenly Qian Tong laughed aloud, his smile unrestrained.

“No more suppression, no more restraints! It feels as if the shackles that bound me all this time have suddenly vanished!” Mo Yu’s face was alight with excitement, his spirit soaring.

Yang Xiuzhu and the other two felt the same; they exchanged glances and saw the joy reflected in one another's eyes.

"Congratulations to you all," Yang Kai said with a grin, knowing exactly what they meant and offering his felicitations.

This cultivation star lacked the powerful suppressive heavenly law of Dark Star, which meant the bonds that had prevented them from comprehending deeper layers of the Martial Dao had been removed.

They now had a chance, a hope to ascend to the Void King Realm!

Everyone's excitement knew no bounds.

"Yang Kai, I will not say much; your kindness is engraved in my memory!" Qian Tong said solemnly to Yang Kai.

Mo Yu, having realized, hurried to offer his thanks as well.

Had Yang Kai not led them away from Dark Star, they would have remained trapped like countless predecessors—until old age, never nearing the threshold of the Void King Realm.

This opportunity was granted by Yang Kai.

"Elder Qian, you flatter me. For now, let's find a place to settle; perhaps we should stay here for a while," Yang Kai said, gazing toward a distant city.

"Indeed. Although the heavenly laws here don't suppress us, we must first investigate whether this place is truly suitable for advancement," Qian Tong agreed.

With consensus reached, they set off at once toward the distant city.

In Lushui City, inside a teahouse, Yang Kai and the others sat around a table.

A young waiter served a pot of spirit tea and was about to withdraw when Qian Tong stopped him.

"Does the elder require anything further?" the waiter asked, bowing and smiling obsequiously at Qian Tong.

The teahouse bustled with comings and goings; the waiter had long since honed eyes like a hawk—though he could not sense the cultivation of Qian Tong and the others, he could tell they were powerful and dared not be negligent.
