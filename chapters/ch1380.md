## Chapter 1380 — Tenfold Certainty

On the auction hall's high platform, Yan Pei waited in silence for the length of half an incense stick; seeing that no one still offered an exchange, a trace of disappointment crossed his face. "It seems none of you have any news of Flowing Flame Fireblaze or Soul Cleansing Divine Water. Very well—thank you all for coming to show your support!"

Having said that, he turned and left.

Although the experts from the great powers desired the Star Emperor Token, none could meet the token owner's conditions, and so they could only shake their heads and sigh—after all, one could not simply seize it by force. Beyond the uncertain value of a single Star Emperor Token, the Jubao Tower was not an institution to provoke lightly.

In an instant, the cultivators in the auction hall began to file out; Yang Kai casually scanned the room and was surprised to find that Lu Ye had disappeared without him noticing.

That fellow slipped away quickly—he knew he had been extravagant this time and had drawn much attention; staying would bring no good. Yang Kai snorted softly and, indifferent, rose to his feet. He told the young woman Qing'er, "Take me to see Elder Yan Pei; I have a matter to ask of him."

"Yes!" Qing'er agreed without pressing for details and immediately walked ahead to lead the way.

Although Yang Kai had only bid once at this auction, it showcased considerable wealth. Moreover, on the way to the Jubao Tower Qing'er had personally seen Yan Pei treating Yang Kai with warmth, so she naturally understood that Yan Pei and Yang Kai were not strangers. A person like that certainly had the standing to be received by Yan Pei.

Just as they stepped out of Private Room B-13, Yang Kai suddenly felt two subtle Divine Senses sweep across him. His movement paused slightly, then he acted as if nothing had happened and followed Qing'er onward.

Though he couldn't identify who had been spying on him, Yang Kai had his suspicions.

It could only be that Old Woman Feng from the Myriad Beasts Mountain and Jin Shi from the Demon Blood Sect. During the auction, he had made a move only once, and the only two who had competed against him were those very two. It seemed they still hadn’t given up on that Xuan Gold.

He snorted inwardly, but showed no sign of it on his face.

The Divine Senses that had scanned him had only passed briefly with no further intention. A short while later Yang Kai arrived at a side chamber in the rear hall of the Jubao Tower and sat upright, waiting solemnly.

After about half a teacup of tea's worth of time, Yan Pei pushed open the door with a gloomy face that nonetheless bore a faint smile as he looked at Yang Kai. "Young friend Yang."

"Greetings, Elder Yan!" Yang Kai rose and cupped his fist.

"Yes, sit." Yan Pei gestured and then took the chair beside Yang Kai. Coming straight to the point, he asked, "Tell me—do you have something you need my help with?"

"Elder Yan's insight is keen. I do indeed have a matter for your assistance," Yang Kai grinned, then added, "More precisely, I wish to make use of the resources of your esteemed tower."

"Very well, speak then. But be warned, the Jubao Tower's principle is harmonious profit—if you want my help you'll need to pay an appropriate price, and the tower and I do not take business that involves murder or robbery."

"I understand that. What I seek does not violate the Jubao Tower's principles."

"Good." Yan Pei nodded with satisfaction.

"I am searching for an earth-attributed supreme treasure."

Yan Pei raised a brow and regarded Yang Kai thoughtfully, chuckling, "Today you spared no expense to obtain a Xuan Gold, and now you're seeking an earth-attributed supreme treasure—are you cultivating some secret art?"

This old fox! Yang Kai cursed inwardly. He knew that someone as knowledgeable and experienced as Yan Pei could easily piece things together from the slightest hint. Still, he wasn’t foolish enough to admit anything outright. Instead, with a half-smile, he said, “Senior Yan, does Jubao Tower truly handle not only the collection of the world’s treasures but also the gathering of information?”

Those words had come from Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain during the auction; Yang Kai was merely reusing them, so he would not offend anyone by saying them.

Yan Pei paused, then laughed loudly. "I only asked idly. If you don't wish to tell me then don't, but do give me some specific requirements—so the Jubao Tower and I have a direction to search. Perhaps we won't need to seek it out; the tower's stores might already contain what you need."

"The specific requirement is simply an Inner Core of a Demonic Beast no lower than Tenth-Tier."

"A Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast..." Yan Pei's eyes narrowed; he stared at Yang Kai in astonishment. Though he had some suspicions, he didn't expect Yang Kai's demand to be so high. If that were truly the case, the tower's reserves likely could not meet it. After all, a Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast equated to a cultivator of the Void King Realm, and such things could not exist on Dark Star.

"It's not strictly limited to the Inner Core—so long as the grade or value is not below that of a Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast's Inner Core, it will suffice," Yang Kai clarified.

"Hrm, that is difficult. I cannot make any promises, only that I will do my best to keep an eye out. Of course, you should not sit idle either—perhaps fate will smile upon you and you will obtain such a thing yourself."

"I understand that," Yang Kai nodded. He would not pin all his hopes on the Jubao Tower. He had come to see Yan Pei chiefly about the Star Emperor Token.

With that thought, Yang Kai shifted the subject and said, "By the way, Elder Yan, about the Star Emperor Token you earlier produced..."

"What, you want to exchange?" Yan Pei's tea paused at the mention; his brow rose and he asked eagerly, almost impatiently.

Yang Kai was surprised; Yan Pei had said the token was offered by an old secluded friend for exchange. That Yan Pei would appear so eager suggested a deep relationship with that reclusive master—otherwise why would the old black-faced man be so concerned?

"Yes, I want to exchange it," Yang Kai said, nodding as he thought.

"Do you have Flowing Flame Fireblaze?" Yan Pei's eyes widened and he asked excitedly.

Yang Kai shook his head.

Yan Pei frowned, then cried out, "Do you know where one might find Soul Cleansing Divine Water?"

"I do not." Yang Kai still shook his head. Soul Cleansing Divine Water was exceedingly rare and could not be carried; it had to be used on-site. If people had found such water in the Flowing Flame Sandland, Qu Changfeng, Leng Qing, and the others would have already divided and taken it, with no need to bathe in the pool.

Seeing he had neither the Flowing Flame Fireblaze nor any news of Soul Cleansing Divine Water, Yan Pei's pleasant expression soured despite his good impression of Yang Kai. He said lightly, "Young friend Yang, are you teasing this old man? I've said more than once that my friend will only exchange the Star Emperor Token for those two items. You have neither Flowing Flame Fireblaze nor any information on Soul Cleansing Divine Water—how dare you ask to exchange the Star Emperor Token with me?"

"Calm yourself, Elder!" Yang Kai smiled, showing no panic. After a moment's thought he said, "If it is convenient, might I speak with that gentleman in person? I will not disappoint him."

Seeing his resolute air, Yan Pei looked skeptical and wondered what confidence Yang Kai could possibly have.

If anyone else had spoken like that, Yan Pei would have kicked them out long ago. But Yang Kai's origins were mysterious; word was he had drifted to Dark Star from the Star Domain outside, and perhaps he possessed things local folk lacked—substances that could rival Soul Cleansing Divine Water or Flowing Flame Fireblaze in effect.

With that in mind Yan Pei's expression cleared slightly, though he remained grave. "Very well, I'll have him come over. But, Young friend Yang, you had better be certain."

"Is one hundred percent certainty enough?" Yang Kai grinned full of confidence.

After all, even if his prior guesses were wrong, he still possessed Flowing Flame Fireblaze—he merely preferred not to produce it unless absolutely necessary.

Yan Pei's mouth twitched; he abandoned further words, produced a Transmission Compass, poured Divine Sense into it and issued a few terse instructions, then sat quietly waiting.

Less than half an incense stick later, there came a knock at the door.

"Come in!" Yan Pei called.

The door swung open and a youthful-looking man entered. Though he appeared young, the wrinkles at his eyes betrayed that he was not as young as he seemed.

This man’s appearance was rather peculiar—sharp-mouthed and monkey-cheeked, with a pair of small eyes that seemed never to open fully, leaving only two narrow slits through which a gleam of cunning light flickered. His figure was tall and lean, his arms slightly longer than most, his palms broad. What drew the most attention, however, was that he possessed an overbite so pronounced that his upper teeth jutted out to cover his lower jaw.

Yang Kai's first impression of the man, apart from being repulsive, was that he was utterly sleazy.

For a moment Yang Kai was dumbstruck. He swept a Divine Sense over the man and discovered the fellow was only a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator.

This was the secluded old friend's man Yan Pei had mentioned?

How did he look like a scoundrel who prowled city alleys? Yang Kai almost spat out his tea. Even Yang Yan sitting nearby covered her mouth with a small hand, unable to restrain a laugh at his bizarre appearance.

Yan Pei cleared his throat and proclaimed, "Don't let your imaginations run—this man is the junior of my old friend. The old friend cannot leave seclusion, so this Star Emperor Token was brought by his junior."

Yang Kai finally showed an expression of realization. If the junior of that reclusive master was of this cultivation and age, it was plausible.

"Mr. Yan, did you call for me?" The bucktoothed cultivator showed no sign of acknowledging Yang Kai or Yang Yan; he entered and asked directly.

"Yes," Yan Pei nodded lightly.

The man brightened and asked eagerly, "Have you news of the exchange item?"

"Something of a lead, perhaps." Yan Pei seemed unsure how to phrase it; the answer stunned the man for a moment. Then Yan Pei pointed at Yang Kai. "This is Yang Kai, young friend Yang. He says he can meet your requirements, but he wishes to discuss it face to face. I only introduce you—the rest you will negotiate between yourselves."

"Meet my requirements?" The bucktoothed man turned to Yang Kai and sized him up with suspicion and evident disdain.
