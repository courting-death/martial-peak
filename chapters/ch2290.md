## Chapter 2290 — Is This an Illusion?

“Wind’s End!” In a life-or-death moment, the Wind Element martial artist shouted, his figure flickering in place and vanishing like a breeze, escaping in an unknown direction—this was an extremely advanced escape technique.

Yang Kai sneered, extending his dragon claw to grasp at the void. An invisible force surged forth, manifesting as Spatial Law to suppress that patch of space.

The Wind Element martial artist’s figure was forced out in a sorry state, his face full of disbelief, as if he couldn’t believe his strongest life-saving move had been broken so easily by Yang Kai.

“Ah!” The Thunder Element martial artist and Fire Ghost also cried out in shock at the same time.

“Die!” Yang Kai roared, swinging his hand fiercely toward the Wind Element martial artist. A massive Moon Blade appeared, spanning heaven and earth, as if crossing from endless time and space, forming a crescent that slashed toward the Wind Element martial artist with unstoppable force.

The Wind Element martial artist’s face turned deathly pale, his nerves taut as he swallowed hard. Bound by Spatial Law, he was unable to dodge, forced to watch helplessly as death closed in.

"Gather earth into a mountain!" Far away, dozens of zhang away, Mountain Ghost suddenly shouted. With a change of hand seals, the Sumeru Peak appeared again, positioning itself between the Moon Blade and the Wind Element martial artist. Dense earth element surged, drawing up rocks and soil from the ground, which instantly gathered before the Wind Element martial artist to form an indestructible barrier.

Boom...

The Moon Blade slashed down, shattering the barrier, but its power was greatly diminished.

With a crack, the Thunder Element martial artist turned into a bolt of lightning, rescuing the Wind Element martial artist at the critical moment and fleeing to the side.

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he glared viciously at Mountain Ghost.

Ever since the fight with the Blood Saber group began, Mountain Ghost had ruined his plans again and again. If not for this man’s powerful defenses, the four Blood Saber members would never have lasted so long against Yang Kai’s full strength.

If he wanted to kill these four, Mountain Ghost had to be the first to go. Otherwise, with him defending, Yang Kai simply couldn’t kill the other three. Especially with Mountain Ghost sitting there, their auras linked, sealing off this world and preventing Yang Kai from teleporting.

With this thought, Yang Kai grew ruthless, a sinister smile on his lips. He said coldly, “You all truly have impressive means. I, Yang, have had my eyes opened today.”

“Brat, stop boasting!” Fire Ghost, though shocked by Yang Kai’s strength, wasn’t too afraid with the numbers on his side. He shouted, “If you surrender now, it’s not too late. Otherwise, once we get going, we can’t guarantee your life!”

The Thunder Element martial artist nodded, “That’s right. If we really kill you, we can’t explain it to the higher-ups. Just give up and be captured.”

The Wind Element martial artist’s face was gloomy and he said nothing, apparently still unsettled after his brush with death.

“Heh heh heh heh...” Yang Kai let out another cold laugh.

Fire Ghost snorted, “Putting on airs!”

Yang Kai’s smile faded as he glared coldly at him. “Then open your dog eyes and see if I’m just putting on airs!”

As he spoke, his Divine Sense surged like a tide. He shouted, “Come out!”

As his shout rang out, a small mountain abruptly manifested above the wasteland, plunging down from midair and smashing into the ground, shaking the earth violently as dust and debris billowed skyward.

The four Blood Saber members were all stunned, staring blankly at the small mountain, unable to figure out what kind of technique Yang Kai had used to conjure a mountain out of thin air.

"What the hell is that!" The Wind Element martial artist, regaining his composure, impatiently waved his hand. A gust of wind blew away the dust, revealing the small mountain to the four.

In the next moment, all four Blood Saber members’ eyes bulged as they stared at the small mountain, their faces full of disbelief.

“Hey, hey, hey... Am I seeing things?” Fire Ghost couldn’t help shouting, swallowing hard. “Why does that little mountain... look like a person, with two arms and two legs!”

Gulp.

The other three also swallowed, their expressions strained.

“What is that thing?” the Wind Element martial artist exclaimed.

“And there’s a woman!” The Thunder Element martial artist’s eyes narrowed, staring at the beautiful figure sitting on the small mountain’s shoulder.

“It’s an illusion, right? This is an illusion!” Fire Ghost, looking badly shaken, muttered to his companions, “Did that little mountain just smile at me? This has to be an illusion.”

“Yeah, maybe!” The Wind Element martial artist looked thoughtful. “Probably some illusion technique from that brat.”

As he spoke, he glanced at Yang Kai, only to see Yang Kai smiling meaningfully at them, a look that sent chills down his spine and filled him with dread.

“You should have called us out sooner.” Hua Qingsi sat on the Incarnation’s shoulder, swinging her legs and pouting. “I don’t know why you bothered fighting them alone, wasting time and energy.”

She seemed to have watched the earlier battle clearly from within the Small Xuan Realm.

The Incarnation grinned, his voice like muffled thunder: “Well, here we are now!”

The sudden speech from the person and the mountain startled the four Blood Saber members, turning their faces pale. Everything they saw and heard felt so real, as if the person and the little mountain truly existed, not just illusions.

Yang Kai chuckled, “I didn’t expect these four to be so strong. I thought I could show off by fighting four alone.”

“And you almost got beaten into a pig’s head!” Hua Qingsi snorted.

Yang Kai pursed his lips, “It wasn’t that bad. They’re just a bit tricky. Sister Hua, pick one for yourself.”

Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes sparkled as she giggled, her gaze sweeping over the four Blood Saber members before settling on Fire Ghost. She pointed and said, “I’ll take him!”

“Everyone likes to pick the softest persimmon.” Yang Kai laughed helplessly.

Fire Ghost’s face twisted in anger. “Brat, I’m warning you—call me the soft persimmon one more time and I’ll fight you to the death!”

Among Wind, Thunder, Fire, and Mountain, the Blood Saber group’s strength and status were equal, but Fire Ghost had been called the softest persimmon by Yang Kai several times, making him furious and feeling underestimated.

Hua Qingsi laughed, “Those three focus on defense and speed. I don’t want to deal with them. This one’s just right.”

“That works!” Yang Kai nodded. The two of them ignored Fire Ghost completely, making him even angrier.

“So... you’ll handle Mountain Ghost, right?” Yang Kai looked at the Incarnation.

The Incarnation rumbled with laughter, “Just what I wanted!”

Mountain Ghost specialized in defense, making him the perfect opponent for the Incarnation, who was powerful but slow.

“Let’s begin.” Yang Kai said casually, as if inviting family to dinner.

Hua Qingsi let out a tinkling laugh. With a graceful sway, she leapt lightly from the Incarnation’s shoulder, her figure gliding elegantly toward Fire Ghost. Midway, a colorful ribbon Secret Treasure suddenly appeared in her hand, twining and fluttering between her fingers, casting shimmering halos of light as it danced through the air.

“Little brother, come play!” Hua Qingsi called to Fire Ghost with fiery enthusiasm.

Fire Ghost’s expression grew serious. He glanced at the Wind and Thunder Element martial artists.

The Wind Element martial artist nodded slightly, and only then did Fire Ghost summon his power, his whole body wrapped in flames as if he were burning. He shouted, “Illusion or not, since you dare come for me, be ready to die! This Lord won’t go easy on you!”

“So fierce!” Hua Qingsi covered her lips, feigning fear. “Don’t be so mean, you’re making my heart race...”

“Die!” Fire Ghost was unmoved. With a sweep of his Blood Saber, flames surged and turned into a ferocious fire dragon, lunging at Hua Qingsi.

Hua Qingsi’s face darkened. She gritted her teeth, “Going all out? I’m a woman, you know! I’ll fight you for real!”

As she spoke, the ribbon was infused with Origin Qi, coming alive and dancing in the air, painting dazzling patterns that enveloped Fire Ghost.

In an instant, the two clashed fiercely, their moves ruthless and the battle intense.

Meanwhile, the Wind and Thunder Element martial artists suddenly felt as if a massive invisible mountain was pressing down on them. The space around them buzzed, and countless tiny black spatial cracks appeared, wriggling like living things.

The two looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned, “You two had best not move. Once my companion sends yours on their way, I’ll deal with you next.”

The Wind Element martial artist’s face darkened, “You think a mere illusion can kill us? Isn’t that a bit childish?”

"An illusion, is it... heh heh heh heh..." Yang Kai chuckled lightly, his expression infuriatingly smug. The Wind and Thunder Element martial artists, seeing this, itched to rush over and give him a good beating.

Not only did the Blood Saber group think this was an illusion, but Ye Qinghan did too. Standing far away, she was stunned to see a giant stone man and a beautiful woman appear, rubbing her eyes and telling herself over and over that it was just an illusion...

But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t find any flaw in the illusion. The giant stone man and the woman seemed completely real.

Thud, thud, thud...

The Incarnation had already started walking toward Mountain Ghost.

Even though Mountain Ghost kept telling himself it was an illusion, when he saw the Incarnation coming, he couldn’t help swallowing, his face turning pale.

The Incarnation’s massive body exerted an overwhelming pressure.

In just a few steps, the Incarnation stood before Mountain Ghost.

Looking up, Mountain Ghost was sitting cross-legged right in front of the Incarnation’s nose. The tiny figure formed a stark visual contrast with the Incarnation’s enormous body.
