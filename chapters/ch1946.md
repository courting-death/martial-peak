## Chapter 1946 — Source Crystal

Time passed in the blink of an eye; Yang Kai had been in the Biyu Sect for over a month.

A month had allowed him to learn the rough layout of the Sect, and during that time his life with Liu Qianyun was calm and uneventful—nothing but training after training—and no one had come to trouble them, nor had the Sect issued any tasks.

Judging by the situation, joining the Biyu Sect had turned out to be a sensible choice; at the very least it provided a place to stay.

Yet Yang Kai knew this was only temporary.

Any disciple who joined a Sect would have to give back at some point; the reason he and Liu Qianyun were carefree now was simply that the Biyu Sect had not met any trouble—once the Biyu Sect faced external enemies or other crises, they too would have to take part in the fighting.

He felt not the slightest sense of belonging to the Biyu Sect and naturally did not intend to spill his blood for such a Sect.

Moreover, Yang Kai constantly felt as if a pair of eyes were watching him and Liu Qianyun, clearly because the two of them had only just joined the Sect and were still under observation.

Yang Kai did not pay it much mind; he and Liu Qianyun had not behaved in any outlandish way during this period and had kept to the rules, so even if someone watched them it would not expose anything.

Within the Biyu Sect there was a bustling market district where disciples traded goods or purchased supplies; the best, most open stretches of road were naturally occupied by powerful, influential disciples, while the more remote spots were left for ordinary disciples to use.

Early one morning, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun arrived at that market and went straight into a modest, poorly decorated shop in a secluded corner.

Outside the shop, over thirty martial artists were already lined up in a single-file line, and when they saw Yang Kai arrive they all clasped hands in greeting: “Junior Brother Yang, you're early.”

“Junior Brother Yang, hurry up and start—brothers have been waiting half the day.”

“Junior Brother Yang, I was the first to arrive today—take care of mine first!”

These martial artists were almost all at the Void King Realm; a few were at the Origin Returning Realm. Each wore an affable smile and actively greeted Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled and clasped his hands. “I'll get started right away. Sorry to have kept you, Senior Brothers and Sisters.”

As he spoke, he was about to step into the shop.

At that moment a graceful, dazzling young married woman sauntered over, ignoring the curious looks of others, slipped her arm through Yang Kai's, pressed her ample breasts against his elbow, and breathed sweetly in his ear: “Junior Brother, forget them—will you refine a batch of Nine-Turn Void Spiritual Pills for your Senior Sister today? Senior Sister plans to go back and close-door cultivate afterward.”

“Uh… Senior Sister, this shop has rules—first come, first served.” Yang Kai showed an embarrassed look and subtly withdrew his arm.

The woman persisted, still clinging to Yang Kai. “No problem—I'll talk to them; they wouldn't dare refuse. If you help Senior Sister first, Senior Sister can…”

Trailing off, she leaned in and whispered several words in Yang Kai's ear, her beaming eyes full of seductive intent.

“Is there such a treat?” Yang Kai's eyes gleamed green and he looked excited.

“Hmph!” Liu Qianyun's pretty face turned cold; she glanced at Yang Kai with contempt and snorted a meaningful note through her nose.

Yang Kai let out an awkward chuckle, reached out and patted the young woman's soft bosom, looking regretful as he said, "Senior Sister, rules can't be broken — this Junior Brother is powerless to help. However... if you are inclined, you could visit my humble abode another day and we can have a proper chat."

Seeing her seduction fail, the woman sneered and said, “Not even willing to do a little favor—what a stingy one!”

She brusquely jerked her arm free and shot Liu Qianyun a vicious glare, as if blaming her for spoiling the chance.

Liu Qianyun, expression deadpan, took out a pre-made sign from her Spatial Ring, thrust it down in front of them, and said coldly, “Please queue in order, Senior Brothers and Sisters, for pill refining. Payment and the commission are listed on the sign; please prepare the materials for whatever Spiritual Pill you require in advance. If refining fails, no refunds!”

Everything she mentioned was already written on the sign and did not need repeating, but she still responsibly said it aloud once.

While she spoke, Yang Kai had already tiptoed into the shop, taken out his Purple Void Cauldron, closed his eyes to center himself, and prepared to begin a day's work.

Over a month of living together had made Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun's relationship increasingly harmonious; in this unfamiliar Star Realm the two were not from the same Star Domain, yet because they shared so many similarities they still got along well.

But not long after arriving at the Biyu Sect the two discovered a problem—cultivation resources were unavailable!

Although they were disciples of the Biyu Sect, the Sect did not hand out cultivation resources for no reason; to obtain resources one had to give back to the Sect or find a way to acquire them oneself.

For experts at the Void King Realm, Saint Crystals were useless—the energy stored in Saint Crystals could not satisfy the needs of Void King Realm practitioners.

In the Star Realm there was something called a Source Crystal that had taken the place of the Saint Crystals.

The energy stored within a Source Crystal was countless times more concentrated and rich than that of a Saint Crystal; even Void King Realm or Dao Origin Realm cultivators could satisfy their training needs with it.

Like Saint Crystals, Source Crystals were divided into upper, middle, and lower grades, with an exchange ratio of one to ten between each grade. They were the hard currency among martial artists!

In other words, if Yang Kai wanted to speed up his cultivation he had to find a way to obtain Source Crystals so he could purchase what he needed.

But he was unfamiliar with this place and had no idea how to get his own cultivation resources.

After discovering the market, Yang Kai had the idea of refining pills for others to earn Source Crystals.

He was a Void King-Grade alchemist and had once triggered the Great Dao Pill Tone. Though his alchemy lacked the innate genius of Xia Ningshang, it was by no means weak.

A Void King-Grade alchemist was a formidable figure in his home Star Domain.

But in the Star Realm it was ordinary.

So Yang Kai was not worried about exposing anything; as long as he was careful and did not go too far, his identity as an alchemist could earn him more respect and, indirectly, greatly increase the safety of him and Liu Qianyun.

Having weighed these pros and cons, Yang Kai did not hesitate; after a brief discussion with Liu Qianyun they began operating in the market.

The first few days were extremely hard.

No one was willing—or dared—to hand over their medicinal ingredients to him for refining.

After all, the cultivation materials Biyu Sect disciples had obtained were won with their lives—who would trust them to an unknown Junior Brother? Moreover, there were other alchemists in the market; there was no need to risk losing both goods and money to try Yang Kai.

For three straight days Yang Kai did not land a single deal, and Liu Qianyun nearly despaired.

On the fourth day Yang Kai hardened his heart and put up a sign offering free pill refining with full compensation for any failures.

This killer move finally drew the first person brave enough to be the guinea pig.

After all, with full compensation promised even if refining failed, there was nothing to lose by trying.

While Yang Kai refined his first Spiritual Pill, Liu Qianyun fidgeted like an ant in a hot pan, anxious.

They did not even have a single Source Crystal between them; if refining failed they would have no way to compensate the customer.

They waited an hour, which felt like a year.

Yang Kai actually succeeded in refining it!

Moreover, the Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill he produced was of the highest quality—flawless—leaving the purchaser greatly satisfied! When the pill formed, its aroma was rich and drifted across half the street, leaving people unbelieving.

The client was overjoyed, praising Yang Kai's skill repeatedly and promising to return in the future if he needed more pills.

Yang Kai accepted the praise graciously and made one request—help him spread the word so more people would come to him for refining.

The Biyu Sect disciple who benefited readily agreed.

On the first day Yang Kai refined three batches of pills, all successful and all of excellent quality.

On the second day he refined eight batches…

By the third day, the martial artists lining up for Yang Kai's refining had already formed a long queue.

Yang Kai immediately had Liu Qianyun take down the free-refining sign and post fixed prices: a stated fee in Source Crystals for each type of pill!

The nearly month of hard work earned Yang Kai a substantial amount of Source Crystals, but more importantly his name began to spread in the market. Almost every Biyu Sect disciple who visited the market knew there was a shabby shop in this remote corner with a Junior Brother whose alchemy was extremely skilled—not only were failures rare, but his Spiritual Pills were of superb quality.

Seekers of pills flocked to him, turning the little shop's doorway into a bustling, lively scene.

Yang Kai exercised restraint; he never refined pills with visible Pill Patterns, and he would occasionally deliberately fail one or two batches as a disguise.

Only by doing so could he better conceal the depth of his alchemical skill.

A few years ago on Shuiyue Star he had triggered the Great Dao Pill Tone, which elevated his comprehension and command of the Pill Dao to an incredible level; now his alchemy proceeded even more smoothly, and various medicinal ingredients seemed to come alive in his hands.

His refining process harmonized with the Great Dao in ways ordinary human effort could not match.

As for Liu Qianyun, she was responsible for receiving those who came for pills outside, carrying the materials into the shop, and handing the finished Spiritual Pills to those waiting outside.

The two each performed their duties, cooperating without issue.

Every night after finishing work, Yang Kai gave Liu Qianyun thirty percent of that day's earnings.

In truth, by Liu Qianyun's original thinking she did not deserve even ten percent—after all, Yang Kai did the refining and she only handled the reception.

But Yang Kai insisted on giving her thirty percent, and Liu Qianyun was deeply grateful for his generosity.
