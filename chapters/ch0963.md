## Chapter 963 — Fusion of the Demon Eye

Within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, an abrupt calamity erupted.

Just after he had finished probing the secret left by the Great Demon God after exploring the starry sky, surging waves of energy suddenly poured into his Sea of Consciousness.

Torrents turned the whole Sea of Consciousness into roaring tempest; the island conjured by the Warm Spirit Lotus rose and fell upon the ocean as if it might be overturned at any moment.

Yang Kai strained to hold the Sea of Consciousness steady, but he could not stop it.

The energies came like gale and lightning, tearing his Sea of Consciousness apart and leaving him in agonizing torment.

Hovering above his Sea of Consciousness, the World-Ending Demon Eye issued a pull that absorbed all the incoming energies, and in an instant the entire Sea of Consciousness was plunged into darkness.

This was Yang Kai's domain; here he was sovereign, able to command everything, to alter the scenery and layout at will.

Yet when the World-Ending Demon Eye devoured those energies, Yang Kai suddenly realized he had lost control over his own Sea of Consciousness.

His Spirit Body felt as if it were falling into a bottomless abyss, tumbling forever with no end, filling him with dread.

In the darkness, only the golden light emitted by the World-Ending Demon Eye shone, blinding to behold.

His Spirit Body was enveloped by that gold, and a horror of being consumed gripped him.

The World-Ending Demon Eye's golden light suppressed all soul energies; the spirit energy of experts Yang Kai had slain would be drawn there and then purified by that gold.

It had never harmed Yang Kai before.

But this time was different; Yang Kai vaguely felt that if he did nothing, he might suffer the same fate as those others—his Spirit Body could be purified away, leaving only some refined spirit energy.

If that happened, he would cease to exist forever.

Howling in resistance, Yang Kai saw a streak of six-colored light flare faintly in the darkness. His heart jolted and his Spirit Body hastened to flee toward it.

Moments later, his Spirit Body set foot upon the Six-Colored Treasure Isle.

On that isle countless small, hidden Soul-Devouring worms lived; after long nourishment they had seemingly grown stronger than before.

Yang Kai ignored them. With a flick of his Divine Sense the Six-Colored Treasure Isle reverted to its original form—the Warm Spirit Lotus—and the lotus petals gradually closed, wrapping his Spirit Body within.

The golden light swelled; the rays from the World-Ending Demon Eye blazed like a scorching sun, evaporating the energy in Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness and causing it to dry up rapidly.

An unimaginable pain transmitted from the depths of his soul.

Yang Kai clenched his teeth and drove the Warm Spirit Lotus's power, continuously replenishing the vanishing force of his Sea of Consciousness.

Gradually the pain weakened considerably, and Yang Kai, full of wonder and doubt, realized an unusual connection was forming between himself and the World-Ending Demon Eye that belonged to the Great Demon God.

Since obtaining the World-Ending Demon Eye, Yang Kai had been trying to refine it, but he had never succeeded.

Although he could employ the Eye's purifying power, fundamentally that golden solitary eye was an alien thing residing in his Sea of Consciousness, not truly his possession.

This was entirely different from the Warm Spirit Lotus.

After enduring a series of agonies, a real link finally formed between him and the World-Ending Demon Eye; the energies that had been evaporated from his Sea of Consciousness became a bridge connecting him and the Eye, breaking down the barrier and making the World-Ending Demon Eye recognize him.

Perceiving this, Yang Kai instantly brightened with elation.

He began to recklessly drive the Warm Spirit Lotus's power, endlessly spawning new sea waters in his Sea of Consciousness, which were then evaporated and absorbed by the World-Ending Demon Eye.

As time passed, the agony upon his soul grew ever lighter until it vanished entirely, and it even left Yang Kai with a refreshing, exhilarated sensation.

At a certain point he sensed that the World-Ending Demon Eye had truly become his possession.

The World-Ending Demon Eye, long suspended in midair, in that instant fell like a meteor and hurtled straight toward Yang Kai.

The Warm Spirit Lotus wrapping Yang Kai spread its petals open; Yang Kai watched the oncoming World-Ending Demon Eye without fear and allowed it to plunge into his Spirit Body and vanish.

The heavens and earth immediately felt different, and a subtle joy rose from his heart.

In the white, hazy world Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes.

Pain spread at his left eye; Meng Wuya and the others beside him looked at him with anxious, tense expressions.

"Yang Kai, what happened?" Meng Wuya hurriedly asked.

The moment the words left his mouth, he froze, horror flooding his eyes as he pointed at Yang Kai: "Your left eye..."

That left eye was no longer the previous black-and-white; it had become a golden pupil, narrow and severe, exuding endless majesty and an icy indifference—exactly like the Great Demon God's earlier gaze, looking down upon all beings with cold superior contempt.

Faintly, an invisible vortex derived from that golden pupil, crazily tugging at Meng Wuya's soul as if it wanted to devour it and destabilize him.

Shopkeeper Meng's face changed drastically; he quickly turned his gaze away and barked, "Close your left eye!"

Yang Kai started, quickly realizing what had happened, and covered his left eye socket with his hand.

His palm felt warm and wet, and there was the scent of fresh blood.

Only then did Li Rong, Han Fei and Di Mo all exhale heavily, their eyes full of shock.

"Young Master, what's wrong with your left eye?" Di Mo asked in a trembling voice. "My soul was nearly sucked away."

"The World-Ending Demon Eye—it's the Great Demon God's World-Ending Demon Eye!" Changyuan cried out in wild alarm; even from a considerable distance just now, when he had looked at Yang Kai, he had felt that pulling force.

It was as if he were facing the Great Demon God himself; the pressure weighed like a mountain.

The Four Great Demon Generals all turned pale, their gazes complex as they regarded Yang Kai.

The Great Demon God possessed many divine arts, and one of them had been cultivated in his left eye: a soul-annihilating golden radiance. Records said the Great Demon God's left eye could see through all worldly illusions and suppress every spirit.

But what Changyuan could not have imagined was that, after thousands of years, the World-Ending Demon Eye could reappear.

And reemerge in a human being!

This left him quite despondent.

He could not fathom how this youngster Yang Kai had earned such fortune and ability.

"I will go into seclusion for a while," Yang Kai said as he covered his eye, wiping the blood that flowed from it.

Meng Wuya nodded; that golden eye was far too dangerous—if Yang Kai could not control it, anyone who approached him thereafter might suffer.

"Then you remain here in seclusion; we will go out first and speak of other matters once you emerge," Meng Wuya instructed gravely, then looked to Changyuan and asked, "Are you all right?"

Changyuan shook his head.

Only then did Yang Kai call forth the Demon God's Secret Codex and open the exit so the others could leave first.

After they departed, Yang Kai immediately immersed himself in his mind and began studying the World-Ending Demon Eye that had merged into him.

......

Time flew by; a month later Changyuan the Demon Lord, the four Demon Generals, Meng Wuya and the others waited in anxious expectation inside the Demon Palace.

During that month Yang Kai had remained in seclusion and they had nothing to do.

Only today did they suddenly detect Yang Kai's presence and realized he must have emerged. They hurried to the chamber where Changyuan resided and stared at the entrance to that sealed room.

Soon the corridor echoed with footsteps.

After a short while Yang Kai's figure appeared before them. Everyone looked at his left eye with lingering dread, only to find it had returned to normal—black and white as before.

"Was it successful?" Meng Wuya asked eagerly.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

It had taken a month, but he had finally learned to open and close the World-Ending Demon Eye at will; this eye, which contained the Great Demon God's divine art, could greatly enhance his combat power.

"Since Saint Lord Yang has emerged from seclusion, let's properly discuss what we saw earlier," Changyuan said sourly, not wanting to dwell on the World-Ending Demon Eye matter.

The others exchanged glances and all nodded.

They had kept this matter bottled inside for a month and could no longer hold back.

In the main hall the demonfolk and Yang Kai took their seats separately.

After a short silence, Changyuan cleared his throat and said in a loud voice, "I believe all present have witnessed what we saw earlier."

Everyone nodded together.

"The Great Demon God did indeed fall, but it was not, as rumors claimed, that he perished while exploring the starry sky; rather he died for the sake of the entire Tongxuan Continent," Changyuan sighed with feeling, his expression earnest. "The Lord was admirable and worthy of respect!"

Meng Wuya snorted, "He's been dead for thousands of years—spare the formalities."

Changyuan looked at him coldly, "These are the Lord's great merits; no one can deny them. Had he not fought himself to exhaustion back then, this continent would long ago have fallen to those invaders from beyond the stars."

"Say what you will," Meng Wuya scoffed. Though he bore no love for the demonfolk, he could not deny the Great Demon God's actions had changed the Tongxuan Continent's fate.

Unfortunately, the Bone Race people had not been entirely wiped out. Although the messages left by the Great Demon God indicated the star-external invaders were all dead, some of the Bone Race had surely stealthily concealed themselves and avoided the Lord's sight.

After thousands of years they had revived.

"Thanks to the Lord, we know that above Saint Realm there exists an even higher plane—the Saint King Realm!" Changyuan said in a low, fierce voice, "The Lord had already reached the Saint King Realm in his time!"

Because such power towered above this world, the various seals left behind by the Great Demon God could not be unraveled even by experts like Meng Wuya and Changyuan.

The immense gap in strength left them helpless.

"Among those invaders from beyond the stars there were also Saint King Realm practitioners, but they were all defeated by the Great Demon God—he slew them!"

"I don't quite understand why the Lord used Void Passages scattered across the world to lay out that earth-shattering formation and seal the entire Tongxuan Continent," Meng Ge asked in puzzlement.

“He sensed the danger posed by those outsiders beyond the stars!” Yang Kai said gravely. “The Great Demon God’s method back then wasn’t true sealing, but more of a concealment. Since even Saint King Realm experts had appeared among those outsiders, he knew that once he died, no one would be left to resist if such beings came again. So he laid down a great formation, causing the Tongxuan Continent to fade from the starry sky. In this way, even if outsiders passed nearby, they would find it difficult to detect signs of life here. It was a form of protection.”
