## Chapter 127 — Encountering Danger

In an instant, the breaths of the five became somewhat hurried.

Lan Chudie said, “Let’s first check if there’s any danger around!”

She remained relatively calm, knowing that this place was not ordinary. With such a large pile of wealth laid out, it could very well be a trap.

The five quickly dispersed to investigate the surroundings, and after a moment, they gathered back together, having found nothing unusual.

Still unconvinced, Lan Chudie cautiously pushed out a few palm strikes, the gusts of her palm wind striking the pile of Yang Flame Stones and Yin Origin Stones, yet there was no abnormality. Only then did she nod and say, “There’s no danger.”

The five exchanged glances and hurriedly approached, scooping up the pile of Yang Flame Stones and Yin Origin Stones in large handfuls.

While the others gathered both types, Yang Kai was different; he only picked up the Yang Flame Stones.

As he collected, Lan Chudie suddenly smiled self-deprecatingly, straightened her back, looked reluctantly at the stones in her hands, and sighed as she tossed them aside.

“What’s wrong, Senior Sister Lan?” Nie Yong asked, puzzled.

“Stop picking,” Lan Chudie replied lightly. “If we carry a large bag of stones on our journey, not only will it exhaust our strength, but if we encounter danger, it might become a burden, and we would have to discard it anyway.”

Hearing this, the others finally reacted. They had been a bit too excited at the sight of such wealth and had forgotten this crucial point.

Lan Chudie glanced at everyone and continued, “Moreover, we’ve just arrived here and found this pile of stones. If I estimate correctly, such items are the least valuable here! In other words, these are merely trifling gains; the real treasures are still waiting for us ahead.”

“Senior Sister Lan is right,” Nie Yong agreed, and Zuo An nodded slightly.

Du Yishuang looked at the stone in her hand, her face showing some reluctance as she tossed it away.

Only Yang Kai continued to pick up stones, seemingly ignoring Lan Chudie’s words, which made her frown slightly.

“Hehe, it’s not too late to throw them away when we truly encounter danger,” Yang Kai explained as he continued to collect.

“Suit yourself,” Lan Chudie said, not stopping him. “But we won’t wait for you if you delay us. Once you’ve gathered enough, catch up quickly, and don’t be too greedy.”

“Okay, you all go ahead!” Yang Kai nodded.

Lan Chudie did not linger any longer, stepping over the pile of stones and moving forward. Zuo An shot Yang Kai a disdainful glance, while Nie Yong was more direct, scolding, “You uncultured pauper! Sooner or later, you’ll have to throw it away; you’re just wasting time and energy.”

“I’ll wait for you to catch up,” Du Yishuang kindly stayed behind.

“No need, you go first!” Yang Kai said as he took off his outer garment, clearly preparing to gather more.

Seeing his insistence, Du Yishuang did not press further, nodding before catching up with the others.

Once he was alone, Yang Kai no longer held back. The True Yang Technique operated wildly, as he rapidly absorbed the energy from the Yang Flame Stones while stuffing them into the bag made from his outer garment.

In no time, twenty drops of Yang Liquid had accumulated in his dantian, and his bag was filled to the brim.

That should be enough. Although there were still many Yang Flame Stones here, Yang Kai did not intend to collect them all. One should not be too greedy. Lan Chudie was not wrong; this pile of stones was likely the least valuable thing in this place, so he could not afford to waste too much time on them.

After a stick of incense, Yang Kai finally caught up with the four. During that time, he had absorbed energy from several more Yang Flame Stones.

Upon rejoining them, the expressions of the other three, except for Du Yishuang, were somewhat displeased.

In terms of strength, Yang Kai was the weakest among them, still not at the Qi Movement Realm, clearly a burden. No wonder others looked down on him. If it weren’t for their shared sect, Lan Chudie and Nie Yong likely would not have brought him along.

“This area of rocky hills seems quite large; we’ve been walking for a while and still haven’t found a way out,” Lan Chudie said, her brows slightly furrowed. “Let’s check around some more. If we still can’t find a way out, we should find a place to rest.”

“Alright!” The others had been following Lan Chudie’s lead throughout the journey and naturally would not contradict her now.

“It’s been an hour; who will lead the way now?” Lan Chudie’s beautiful eyes scanned the four.

What dangers lay ahead was still unknown, but whoever was at the front was undoubtedly in the most perilous position. That was why she had suggested changing the leader every hour from the start.

Nie Yong said, “There are disciples from three sects here. Since someone from Lingxiao Pavilion has already led, let’s have either Blood Battle Gang or Fengyu Tower take the lead next.”

As he spoke, he glanced at Zuo An and Du Yishuang.

Zuo An frowned, but before he could speak, Du Yishuang leaped forward, softly saying, “I’ll do it.”

Yang Kai sighed slightly. Though they had temporarily formed a small team, among the five, it seemed only the kind-hearted Du Yishuang was without ulterior motives. The other four, including Yang Kai himself, each had their own plans.

This team was not united! If they truly encountered a significant danger, they would likely fall apart immediately.

After about half an hour of walking, a large open area suddenly appeared ahead. Since they had entered, they had been surrounded by numerous stone pillars, and now they finally saw a somewhat different place, which naturally excited them.

Under Du Yishuang’s lead, the five quickly approached the open area.

Before long, they arrived at the location of the clearing. It was still a part of the rocky hills, but for some reason, it was different from other places. In this clearing stood many vividly realistic stone sculptures, all in human form.

These stone sculptures were roughly the height of a real person, some barehanded, while others wielded weapons, which were varied and peculiar.

Upon a rough count, there were no less than a hundred of these stone sculptures, each with a unique shape.

The five did not dare to rashly venture deeper. Lan Chudie and Nie Yong took the lead to test the waters and found no danger, allowing Du Yishuang to lead them into the group of stone sculptures.

For no reason, a wave of unease surged in Yang Kai’s heart. This feeling came abruptly but was so real that it made his heartbeat quicken.

Looking back at the others, their expressions showed no signs of abnormality; everyone was in awe of the lifelike stone sculptures.

As he scanned the surroundings, Yang Kai suddenly noticed a dark red stain behind one of the stone sculptures.

A faint smell of blood lingered in the air, and next to the dark red stain was a piece of torn cloth, likely from a person’s clothing.

“There’s danger!” Without time to explain further, Yang Kai shouted loudly.

At the same moment, the hundreds of stone sculptures around them suddenly began to move.

The other four were startled, and Lan Chudie, Nie Yong, and Zuo An reacted swiftly, turning back without a second thought. However, Du Yishuang, who was leading, froze for a moment.

This moment of hesitation caused her to miss the perfect opportunity to retreat.

The two stone sculptures beside her raised their fists and fiercely struck down towards her.

The attack power of these stone sculptures was immense. Their fists were as large as cooking pots; if one were to be hit, it would be far from pleasant.

Realizing the danger, Du Yishuang’s energy suddenly surged. The originally quiet and gentle girl now exuded a frenzied aura.

This was the hallmark of the Qi Movement Realm! At this stage, the energy within one’s body becomes extremely unstable. While it may not show during normal times, once in battle, the energy can go berserk, especially when angered. If not controlled properly, one could easily lose themselves in this wild power.

Yet, despite her energy going berserk, Du Yishuang’s eyes remained calm, clearly able to control her strength well.

She swiftly turned, her small palm striking towards the stone sculpture on her left while retreating to avoid the attack from the other stone sculpture.

However, she still lost the best opportunity. The second stone sculpture’s attack was incredibly fast and was about to land on her delicate shoulder.

Just as she was filled with panic, several fiery red Yang Flame Stones flew over like meteors from the sky, carrying immense power, and struck the fist of the second stone sculpture.

With several loud bangs, although it did not stop the second stone sculpture’s attack, it at least deflected its fist slightly, grazing Du Yishuang’s clothing and averting her serious injury.

“Run!” Yang Kai’s voice came from behind, and Du Yishuang felt her body lighten, as if someone had grabbed her collar and pulled her back.

At the same time, a hand reached out from behind to meet the first stone sculpture’s attack.

With a dull thud, both Yang Kai and Du Yishuang were sent flying, landing on the ground, and without looking back, they hurriedly ran away.

Behind them, a thunderous roar echoed as if a thousand horses were galloping. The fleeing five-member team turned their heads in a hurry and felt their hearts sink. The over a hundred stone sculptures were all chasing after them, each moving like the wind, their heavy forms shaking the ground beneath them.

“Don’t look back, hurry and run around the stone pillars!” Lan Chudie shouted sharply.

The others understood immediately and quickly darted like butterflies among the stone pillars of the rocky hills.

In no time, they had shaken off most of the stone sculptures, and after a while, many of the stone sculptures had disappeared from sight.

Only the two that had attacked Du Yishuang continued to cling to Yang Kai and Du Yishuang like leeches, showing no signs of stopping.

“Yang Kai, you bastard, don’t lead them towards me!” Nie Yong yelled angrily while sprinting ahead.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened, ignoring him.

Lan Chudie, however, nimbly leaped onto a stone pillar, turned back, and saw that indeed no stone sculptures were pursuing her. She stared at the two stone sculptures behind Yang Kai and Du Yishuang, her beautiful eyes flickering with uncertainty.

But after a moment, she made up her mind and shouted to the others below, “Stop running! There are only these two; let’s smash them!”

The group, circling around in one spot, felt a jolt at Lan Chudie’s words.

“Since Yang Kai and Du Yishuang were able to withstand their attacks, it means their strength isn’t very high!” Lan Chudie spoke with confidence, her posture proud as she commanded, “Zuo An, you hold one down, and the rest of us will attack the other!”

Zuo An frowned but said nothing further. He quickly turned around, and with a roar, his massive fist, surging with energy, smashed towards one of the stone sculptures.

The stone sculpture, caught off guard while chasing Yang Kai and Du Yishuang, was unexpectedly struck by Zuo An’s punch, causing stone fragments to fly, and it staggered back.
