## Chapter 1108 — The Wondrous Uses of Golden Blood

Yang Kai could only shake his head helplessly as he watched Yang Flame sprawled out in his stone chamber, sleeping on her back with limbs splayed and without a care for appearances.

A month of forging had evidently worn her out; she lay there breathing heavily, her body spread in a star shape, paying no mind to whether she was tempting Yang Kai — those towering, magnificent twin peaks were outrageously conspicuous, her exquisite figure arrestingly eye-catching.

Not even the noise of Yang Kai returning had roused her.

He turned and left the cave again, hunted down a few wild animals on the mountain, made a fire outside the cave, and set them roasting. Yang Flame had expended a great deal of physical and mental energy; a bite to eat would aid her recovery.

Halfway through the roasting, Yang Flame sniffed and trotted out, grinning as she hugged her arms and squatted beside the fire, eyes fixed on the golden roast rabbit, waiting to dig in.

“Rested up?” Yang Kai glanced at her.

“Sort of — I’ll need a few more days yet.” Yang Flame answered offhandedly, then coquettishly piped up, “Turn it over! It’s all burnt on one side, ah, how clumsy — let me do it!”

With that she snatched the spit from Yang Kai’s hands without asking.

Yang Kai didn’t mind; he sat back leisurely and watched her with some puzzlement. “You’re an Origin-Grade artificer — why are you living like this?” he asked.

It was something he couldn’t fathom: Yang Flame had the talent. If she showed it, she could live like one exalted above others; any force on Dark Star would greedily offer her preferential treatment and fight tooth and nail to recruit her.

Yang Flame pouted. “What do you know? You think I should throw myself at those big powers, right?”

Yang Kai nodded.

“I’d rather not.” Yang Flame snorted. “They’re no good — I won’t forge for them.”

Hearing that, Yang Kai understood.

Without the backing of a major force, a woman like Yang Flame couldn’t fully display her skills; she couldn’t obtain high-grade materials to forge with or gain entry to places like the Refining Pavilion. She’d be suspected, and the treasures she made would only be low-tier Secret Treasures.

Even if she kept insisting she was an Origin-Grade artificer, no one would dare bring Origin-Grade materials to test her.

It was a vicious cycle; if she wasn’t miserable, then who was?

Even Yang Kai wasn’t ready to take her at her word; he produced some materials he didn’t need and handed them to her.

“Do you have a grudge against them?” Yang Kai asked.

“Not a grudge, just dislike. I’ve heard that inside every force power and interest tangle — I just want to quietly forge, not be dragged into those troubles.”

That wasn’t wrong. The better the artificer, the more they’d be courted and tugged; every force had internal divisions. Even a small clan like the Haike Family had endless splits; an enormous entity like Yingyue Hall was worse.

Once Yang Flame entered such circles, she’d likely be driven mad by the pestering.

The aroma of roasting meat filled the air. Yang Flame looked at the meat in satisfaction, tore off a rabbit leg and handed it to Yang Kai. He shook his head slowly; she made no ceremony of it and stuffed it into her mouth with relish.

“I sold the Secret Treasures you forged.” Yang Kai said casually.

“Oh — those were yours? Do what you like with them.”

“They fetched twenty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals in total!”

“That’s a fair price, you didn’t get cheated.” Yang Flame nodded nonchalantly.

“How many Saint Crystals do you have?” Yang Kai asked again.

“Why?” Yang Flame went instantly on guard, covertly covering her Spatial Ring as if afraid Yang Kai had his eye on her Saint Crystals. After thinking it over she muttered, “A little over two thousand… Lower-Level Saint Crystals.”

“So poor!” Yang Kai was speechless, shaking his head. He took out some Upper-Level Saint Crystals and several restorative Pills from his ring and handed them over. “Forging burns a lot. Take these.”

Yang Flame wiped her hands and took them without ceremony, stuffing the crystals into her Spatial Ring. She opened a pill bottle and sniffed, touched, and was moved: “Saint King-Grade Pills?”

She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so generous. A single Saint King-Grade Pill was worth a fortune; a few bottles like these equaled half a Secret Treasure she’d forged.

“You seem awash in wealth.” Yang Flame looked at him oddly — materials from Seventh-Tier and Eighth-Tier Demonic Beasts were pulled from his ring in abundance, Saint King-Grade Pills handed over casually, plus an Upper-Level Saint King-Grade Star Shuttle and a seven-colored Origin-Grade Secret Treasure flag.

Yang Flame could hardly imagine how someone at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm could possess so many fine things.

Compared to him she felt worlds apart. He didn’t look like someone with a backing or clan, so where did he get all this?

“Don’t scrimp on the pills; use them up and ask me for more. I have plenty.” Yang Kai advised. He understood her thriftiness and feared she might hoard pills instead of using them to recover.

“You’re too good.” Yang Flame was touched.

With that she went back to gnawing on her roast, her mouth glistening with grease.

A few days later Yang Flame had fully recovered and resumed forging. This time Yang Kai had her work directly inside his stone chamber, which he had set up with Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags to aid her recovery and save forging time, improving her efficiency.

The blazing Yang attribute power constantly surged forth; its fluctuations made Yang Kai feel very comfortable.

While Yang Flame forged, he did not idle; he retreated to her quarters to cultivate in seclusion and accumulate Saint Yuan.

It had been four or five years at least since he had broken into the Third Stage of the Saint Realm. Although he had been sealed inside that blood-colored crystal for much of those years and could not sense the passage of time, after the birth of those hundred drops of Demon God Golden Blood he clearly felt his strength rise.

His realm had silently climbed to a far higher level without his conscious awareness.

He vaguely felt the Saint King Realm was within reach. His comprehension of Dao and martial practice was not lacking; what he lacked was accumulation. Once his Saint Yuan reached a certain threshold, the breakthrough would come naturally.

While gathering Saint Yuan he also studied the wondrous uses of that Golden Blood.

The last time he used a drop of Golden Blood it transformed into a golden spear and resolved the crisis for Wu Yi and the others, which made Yang Kai realize the terrifying potency of even a single drop.

He was eager to know whether his Golden Blood had uses beyond combat.

Recalling the sensations and scene closely, his expression shifted and an idea rose in him. He did not hesitate but squeezed out a drop of Golden Blood and flicked it into the void with his finger.

The Golden Blood slipped into the void and vanished in an instant; when it reappeared it was already a thousand li away.

The same wondrous sensation as before filled him. He sat in his cave on Dragon Lair Mountain, but his eyes could clearly see the scene a thousand li away — that drop of Golden Blood seemed inextricably linked to him, and his consciousness could switch at will between his body and the Golden Blood. Through it he could easily perceive the situation in that distant place.

He immediately entered a detached, ethereal state, his mind following the Golden Blood to observe the surroundings.

He saw city after city slide beneath, mountains rapidly falling behind; the Golden Blood moved with incredible speed, several times faster than a Star Shuttle, and contained within it Yang Kai’s understanding of spatial intricacies — it could break through spatial constraints, moving even faster than the spread of Divine Sense.

A vast life-force surged unabashedly from within the Golden Blood, and everywhere it passed it stirred the great experts of Dark Star.

Countless experts’ gazes trailed the path of the Golden Blood, expressions turned to shock.

They could not tell who emitted such fierce life-energy or how powerful that person truly was — faster than their Divine Sense and gone in a flash, impossible to trace.

High-ranking figures from many forces gathered to discuss whether an enemy had come calling.

Some disbelieving figures chased after the fleeting golden light, hoping to catch a closer look.

Yang Kai had no idea his inadvertent action had set Dark Star in a panic; he was simply immersed in the marvel of the Golden Blood and could not pull himself away.

In only three short days the drop of Golden Blood had circled Dark Star and returned from the opposite direction.

Astonishingly, the life-force within the Golden Blood had hardly diminished — this strange journey seemed no strain at all for it.

Yang Kai was privately moved. His spirit traveled with the Golden Blood and circled the entire Dark Star, understanding the vastness of this cultivation star; by Star Shuttle it would take at least four months to fly a circuit.

But the Golden Blood took merely three days, showing how terrifying its speed was.

What was its limit? How far could his link to it reach?

Yang Kai needed to know. His mind stirred and the returned Golden Blood shot straight upward, soon piercing the clouds and rushing into the Starry Sky, heading for the boundless Star Domain.

Immersed in the Golden Blood, he saw one dead, desolate star after another, vast Meteorite Seas, and the Black Rock Beasts that roamed those seas.

It was an exceedingly strange experience; soaring through the Starry Sky like this was likely beyond even Void King Realm experts.

Golden Blood truly was marvelous.

In that detached state Yang Kai’s body absorbed Spiritual Qi at an accelerated rate, accumulating Saint Yuan far more fiercely than before — his cultivation advanced remarkably.

He did not lower his guard. Only he and Yang Flame remained on Dragon Lair Mountain; with her focused on forging he could not afford to slack, lest someone take advantage.

Fortunately his spirit could switch between his body and the Golden Blood like a soul possessing two bodies. Yang Kai would periodically check the Golden Blood’s movements and felt at ease.

After some time his interest waned. Though he had flown far through the Starry Sky, the life-force within the Golden Blood had only slightly weakened; Yang Kai estimated it could sustain for at least several years before dissipating.
