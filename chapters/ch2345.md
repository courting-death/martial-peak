## Chapter 2345 — The Four Divine Beasts Kill

Since Yang Kai summoned the Slave-Insect Bracelet and released the Soul-Devouring Worms, in less than thirty breaths nearly seventy percent of the martial artists from the major sects who came looking for trouble had perished. Even several Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators failed to escape this calamity.

The Soul-Devouring Worms' overwhelming combat power was beyond Yang Kai's expectations. It was easy to imagine that, given a little more time, even someone like Qiu Ze in the Emperor Realm would likely be killed by the Soul-Devouring Worms.

Ruan Hongbo and the others were already scared out of their wits. They had followed Qiu Ze here to avenge the deaths of Ke Tian and the others, but instead of getting their revenge, they suffered heavy losses themselves.

This struck at the heart of Heavenly Extreme Hall. Those he had brought were its elite.

The same was true for the other sects; each suffered tremendous losses.

He bitterly regretted ever coming to Thousand Leaves Sect. If he hadn’t come, how could things have turned out like this? He could have been enjoying wine and song, enjoying the company of his two beautiful disciples, living a life of pleasure and ease.

Watching familiar and unfamiliar martial artists fall dead around him, while Qiu Ze was powerless to turn the tide, Ruan Hongbo could no longer hold on. If he stayed any longer, there would be only one outcome—death. He desperately urged his Origin Qi, shook off the Soul-Devouring Worms surrounding him, and roared, "Go!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he was the first to charge out of the valley.

The others dared not hesitate and quickly used their movement techniques to fly out as well.

"Trying to escape now? Too late—none of you are leaving!" A crisp voice suddenly rang out from the Formation Foundation platform. Liu Yan, who had been sitting motionless with her beautiful eyes tightly shut, abruptly opened them. Her gem-like eyes gleamed coldly, brimming with murderous intent.

Since the battle began, Liu Yan had been sitting cross-legged here without moving. No one knew what she was doing, not even Yang Kai. Now, seeing her suddenly act, he naturally looked over curiously.

Liu Yan's small hands suddenly formed a seal, and she called out in a clear, tender voice, "Azure Dragon!"

As the seal was completed, she struck toward a nearby mountain peak. The peak was extremely peculiar in shape, looking just like a true dragon lying there.

As the seal landed, the mountain suddenly let out a hum. Immediately, a powerful aura surged from within the peak. At the same time, the mountain, which had lain dormant for tens of thousands of years, seemed to come alive. The grass and trees on the mountain swayed, and rocks shattered.

At the dragon-shaped mountain's head, two enormous eyes suddenly opened, radiating supreme dragon might.

Rumble rumble rumble…

The mountain shot up into the sky, rocks tumbling down. A massive creature, over a hundred zhang long and shining with azure light, suddenly stretched across the heavens. It swayed its head and tail, its aura vast and overwhelming, leaving everyone frozen in place.

Under the pressure of the dragon might, everyone felt insignificant, as if they were mere ants before the Azure Dragon.

"A true dragon?" Hua Qingsi's beautiful eyes narrowed as she stared in disbelief at the scene before her. She simply couldn't believe that such a true dragon had been hidden beneath a mountain in Thousand Leaves Sect.

But she quickly realized something was wrong. This dragon had no trace of life. Although its dragon might was intense, it was definitely not a living creature.

"Heavenly Puppet!" Ye Hen was dumbfounded, his eyes wide as he stared at the Azure Dragon in the sky. In an instant, tears streamed down his old face. He reached out as if to grasp the Azure Dragon, choking with emotion, "This is a Heavenly Puppet!"

"Father, you mean… this is our Thousand Leaves Sect's Heaven-Grade puppet?" Ye Qinghan immediately understood what Ye Hen meant, her heart shaken to the core.

Thousand Leaves Sect's many techniques and secret arts had been lost for tens of thousands of years. The art of puppetry had declined drastically. Not to mention Heaven-Grade puppets, even the Earth-Grade puppets in the square could no longer be controlled by anyone in Thousand Leaves Sect.

As for the Heavenly Puppet, even Ye Qinghan didn't know where it was hidden. Ye Hen had never mentioned it to her.

So the Heavenly Puppet had always been right under their noses!

Ye Qinghan looked around at the various oddly shaped mountains, some near, some far…

It turned out all these mountains were hiding places for the Heavenly Puppets. After tens of thousands of years of wind and sun, and layers of dust, they had all been concealed beneath these peaks, sleeping in silence.

Today, after tens of thousands of years, a Heavenly Puppet had finally been awakened, soaring into the clouds and revealing its majestic form.

What an incredible event. And the one who awakened and controlled this Heaven-Grade puppet wasn't even from Thousand Leaves Sect, but a little girl of seven or eight whom they'd never seen before.

Ye Hen looked at the Azure Dragon in the sky, then at Liu Yan, his old eyes burning with passion. He didn't know why this little girl could control the Heavenly Puppet, but he knew she was with Yang Kai.

In other words, Yang Kai must have found Thousand Leaves Sect's lost techniques and secret arts!

Thousand Leaves Sect truly had hope now!

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows. After a brief thought, he vaguely understood why Liu Yan could control the Heaven-Grade puppet. It probably had to do with her current puppet body—perhaps there was a secret method within her that allowed her to control the Heavenly Puppet.

No wonder she told him to stall for a while and leave the rest to her. So this was the reason.

Even a Heaven-Grade puppet controlled by Liu Yan was enough to sweep through this place. Although the puppet had slept for countless years, Yang Kai could still sense that it possessed the power of the Emperor Realm—and not just any Emperor Realm!

The powerful aura emanating from the Azure Dragon Heavenly Puppet was in no way inferior to the Corpse Puppet in Thousand Leaves Sect's secret realm.

Within Thousand Leaves Sect, the disciples who had been hiding or were injured suddenly began to shout and call out, their voices spreading in waves in all directions. No one had told them, but they could all sense that this was the sect's Heaven-Grade puppet!

Disciples take pride in their sect, and the sect takes pride in its disciples! The reappearance of the Heavenly Puppet after tens of thousands of years was a sign of Thousand Leaves Sect's great revival. Every disciple's heart surged with excitement, unable to contain themselves.

On the other side, Shi Cangying, who was fleeing in panic, was dumbfounded. A wave of regret surged from deep within, nearly making him cough up blood.

He was the leader of the new faction in Thousand Leaves Sect and always felt the sect shouldn't stubbornly cling to the puppet arts left by their ancestors. They should learn other techniques and secret arts to strengthen Thousand Leaves Sect.

That's why his relationship with Ye Hen had always been strained. This time, when Qiu Ze brought people to cause trouble at Thousand Leaves Sect and revealed his Emperor Realm cultivation, Shi Cangying immediately betrayed them. Not only did he ambush and injure Ye Hen, but he also deactivated the Protective Mountain Array. Otherwise, Thousand Leaves Sect wouldn't have suffered such heavy casualties.

Thousand Leaves Sect's Protective Mountain Array was not so easily breached.

Shi Cangying had thought that after today, he could become the Sect Master of Thousand Leaves Sect, take control of the sect, and implement his long-held ideas. But to his disappointment, just one Yang Kai had rendered them powerless.

And now, even the Heavenly Puppet had reappeared.

Shi Cangying was so regretful his guts turned green. If he'd known the Heavenly Puppet could be awakened, why would he have schemed so much? Wouldn't it have been better to obediently remain Vice Sect Master? Maybe he could have gotten a Heavenly Puppet to play with, and even Qiu Ze would have to defer to him then.

But there is no medicine for regret in this world.

An even more despairing scene unfolded before Shi Cangying's eyes.

After awakening the Azure Dragon Heavenly Puppet, Liu Yan continued to form seals and struck toward another mountain range.

That mountain range also resembled a demonic beast, specifically a flying beast, though no one could tell exactly what kind.

"Vermilion Bird!"

The mountain range rumbled, and with a clear, piercing cry, the fiery red Vermilion Bird Heavenly Puppet soared into the sky. The grass and rocks that had covered it for tens of thousands of years fell away, revealing its graceful and powerful form.

"White Tiger!" Liu Yan formed another seal.

The roar of a tiger echoed through the mountains as the third peak shattered. A giant, snow-white tiger leapt out, its fangs gleaming with a chilling light that made everyone shudder.

"Black Tortoise!"

The fourth mountain split open, and the massive Black Tortoise Heavenly Puppet slowly crawled out. Its sturdy, broad shell could easily carry an entire city.

Ye Hen was trembling all over, his eyes nearly bulging from their sockets as he stared in disbelief at the scene before him.

He never imagined that in his lifetime he would witness the reappearance of the Heavenly Puppets. Not only that, but four of them had been awakened at once. His blood surged in his chest, and Ye Hen felt that even if he died now, he would have no regrets.

"You dare hit me? I'll make sure you die with no grave!" Liu Yan glared fiercely at Qiu Ze, her little face full of killing intent, clearly still holding a grudge over being struck into the ground by him earlier.

As soon as she finished speaking, she clapped her hands together, and an almost imperceptible will suddenly surged forth.

In the next moment, the four Heavenly Puppets moved at once, each taking a corner and sealing off the world.

"The Four Divine Beasts Kill!" Liu Yan shouted.

An invisible connection linked the four Heavenly Puppets. Ferocious power surged from their bodies, flooding the sealed space and forming a killing force that seemed capable of destroying the world itself.

Qiu Ze bore the brunt of it. Sensing the oncoming storm of murderous force, he felt as if he'd fallen into an ice cellar, trembling with fear.

In the face of this complex power, his newly attained Emperor Realm felt as fragile as paper.

Sss sss…

The invisible force cut into Qiu Ze like sharp blades. In the blink of an eye, he was covered in blood, his bones exposed, screaming miserably—the scene was utterly tragic.

He begged for mercy, but Liu Yan was unmoved, driving the seals even more fiercely. The killing force of the four Heavenly Puppets grew ever more intense.

In less than ten breaths, Qiu Ze's flesh was completely gone, leaving only a skeleton that collapsed to the ground.

Even before Qiu Ze died, the martial artists from the major sects had already been torn apart by the Four Divine Beasts Kill.

This Four Divine Beasts Kill seemed to be a formation, a killing array set up with the four Heavenly Puppets as its foundation. Even Qiu Ze couldn't last ten breaths—how could anyone else resist?

Ruan Hongbo and the others exploded into blood mist, leaving not a single bone behind.
