## Chapter 1151 — What Did the Disciple Do Wrong?

Yan Pei had already taken the pair of forked hairpins out of the jade box. He circulated his Saint Yuan to sense them, his brow lifting as he couldn't help but praise, "Very good, very good—this Secret Treasure is almost approaching Origin-Grade Middle-Level. The master who forged it paid great attention and possessed superb skill. Most importantly, it's very suitable for women; haha, the young masters will likely bleed heavily over this one."

Yan Pei's gaze was sharp; it was plain how enormous the value of those forked hairpins was. Leaving their grade aside, the very design tailored for women would have those young masters smashing their heads to outbid each other, buy them, and present them to the women they fancied—truly the perfect gift.

Qian Tong opened his mouth, tempted to take the Secret Treasure back, but he also knew that once something was in Yan Pei's hands it could not be retrieved. He sighed deeply and gave up, already thinking whether he should enter the auction and buy the hairpins back. Yingyue Hall had several promising female disciples; bestowing this Secret Treasure on them would surely make them far stronger.

They had barely finished that sigh when the experts appraising the auction items suddenly cried out again, even more excited than before.

"Th-this... this actually is..."

"What?" Yan Pei strode to the group and fixed his gaze on the Secret Treasure in the other jade box. His eyes narrowed. He reached out, lifted the crimson long whip, circulated his Saint Yuan to sense it, and barked: "Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure?"

"Ah?" Qian Tong was aghast, his old face contorting.

"Ha ha, not bad, not bad. This auction finally has a show-stopper. I was worried—this time it was rushed and Jubao Tower couldn't gather many fine items. This whip fills the gap. Hahaha, truly heaven favors me!" Yan Pei laughed heartily, turning to Qian Tong: "Brother Qian, you've really helped me a great deal this time; I won't forget the favor."

Qian Tong's mouth was full of bitterness; he forced a smile, "Brother Yan, you're too polite. We've known each other more than a year or two—helping you out is only natural, hehe..."

Though he said that, in his heart he cursed Luo Qing black and blue. A single Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure had already cost him nearly unbearable pain. Now an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure had appeared as well—damned Luo Qing, why hadn't he explained properly? Had he known earlier that Yang Kai brought two Origin-Grade Secret Treasures to auction, he would never have let them fall into Yan Pei's hands; no matter the price, he would have purchased them for Yingyue Hall's disciples.

But now it was too late. If he wanted them, he'd have to bid, spending who knew how many Saint Crystals—and there was no guarantee he'd win.

Poor Luo Qing had no idea he was already being blamed by Elder Qian. He had no notion that Yang Kai's move was so bold—directly bringing two Origin-Grade Secret Treasures, and one of them even Origin-Grade Middle-Level.

The forked hairpins could be forgiven; given the artificers on Dark Star, they could barely forge such a thing. But the grade of that crimson long whip exceeded the level of Dark Star's artificers. A Secret Treasure of that rank couldn't be forged by ordinary means—it could only be obtained through special channels.

This led to a phenomenon across Dark Star: once a Secret Treasure or pill above Origin-Grade Lower-Level appeared, its price could no longer be judged by ordinary rules—it shot to sky-high levels.

"Good, good, good!" Yan Pei's dark face now bloomed like a peony, erasing all earlier displeasure. He praised it repeatedly, grinning so broadly his mouth almost split to his ears. "Another Secret Treasure perfectly suited for women. This auction will be spectacular—I'm eager to see them scramble for it."

"Ahem... Elder Yan..." a nearly trembling voice came from the side. "Please take another look at this."

The man spoke and handed a jade vial to Yan Pei.

Yan Pei took it, opened the mouth, peered inside, and his eyes immediately bulged. His large hand trembled and he nearly dropped the vial. He hissed: "Origin Condensing Pill!"

Those three words struck Qian Tong's heart like a hammer; without thinking he lunged forward, hand chopping down to snatch the jade vial.

Yan Pei reacted with lightning speed and struck out a palm. The two palms met and both Yan Pei and Qian Tong stepped back.

"What are you doing!" Yan Pei flew into a rage, glaring viciously at Qian Tong.

Qian Tong's expression hardened as he said in a low voice, "Brother Yan, I've thought it through—I won't participate in this auction. Return the items to me."

Had he not seen the Origin Condensing Pill in the vial, Qian Tong might have let it go. But that fleeting glimpse made him instantly realize the Origin Condensing Pill in that vial was far more precious than an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure.

“Now you don’t want to participate? Too late!” Yan Pei snorted coldly. “The items are already in my hands, and you still expect me to spit them back out? Brother Qian, is this your first day knowing me?”

“Wait a minute, Brother Yan Pei — didn’t you just say that no matter how valuable an item is, it still can’t be entered into the auction?” Qian Tong said calmly, not the least bit flustered. For the sake of two Origin-Grade Secret Treasures and that Origin Condensing Pill, what did it matter if he lost a bit of face?

“I said if the item didn’t show up within half a stick of incense, it wouldn’t be included — are your ears clogged?” Yan Pei snorted. Seeing that Qian Tong still had that shameless look and was about to pounce again, he quickly stepped back, sweeping the two jade boxes and jade bottle into his Spatial Ring. With a wave of his hand, he barked, “Keep your eyes on Elder Qian! If he dares take one more step forward — strike him hard!”

"Yes!" Four or five Origin Returning Realm experts answered in unison, taking up stances and glaring at Qian Tong—clearly ready to execute Yan Pei's orders without mercy; any further movement from Qian Tong would bring a storm of attacks.

“Damn it…” Qian Tong couldn’t help but curse. Seeing that force wouldn’t work, he could only resort to pleading. “Old Yan, for the sake of all the years we’ve known each other, can’t you just give the items back? Just pretend you never saw them, alright? I, Qian Tong, will remember this great favor for the rest of my life…”

“No need for a lifetime — you’ve already got one foot in the grave, not many good years left. I don’t need you remembering my kindness,” Yan Pei chuckled, waving his hand dismissively.

"Could you not be so sharp-tongued? I'm in good health; I can still live a few hundred years at least." Qian Tong rolled his eyes.

Yan Pei snorted, "If I were you I'd hurry and have people gather Saint Crystals. You still have time to faff about with me—I'm impressed. Only you and I know these items exist, so you still hold the initiative."

Hearing that, Qian Tong brightened, cupped his hands to Yan Pei, and turned to leave. He understood better than anyone that no amount of talk could get the items back.

"Old Qian, who brought these items to auction?" Yan Pei called after him but received no reply. He guessed his old friend was sulking and laughed: "That man's luck is extraordinary—he found not only two Origin-Grade Secret Treasures but also two Condensing Void Pills. He must be quite fortunate."

Qian Tong left the underground chamber and Luo Qing hurried to meet him, only to be slapped twice across the head by Qian Tong before he could speak.

Although Saint Yuan wasn't used, the elder's two slaps were heavy enough to make Luo Qing grit his teeth.

Qian Tong wore a stormy expression as if a tempest were approaching. Luo Qing stammered, "Elder, what fault have I committed?"

"You fool, why were you so quick? Couldn't you have delayed by half an incense-stick? You nearly drove me mad," Qian Tong scolded.

"Ah..." Luo Qing was stunned.

It had clearly been the elder's own instruction that any auction items from Yang Kai be delivered immediately, not delayed. So why was the elder now saying this? Elder Qian was kind and fair and would never issue such contradictory orders nor beat his disciple without cause. Because of that, in Yingyue Hall he held much prestige and was loved and respected by many disciples.

Although puzzled, Luo Qing did not dare speak. The elder's mood was bad; even a blind man could see it. Better not tempt fate—do more and you may err more, do less and err less, do nothing and you won't err at all, Luo Qing thought anxiously.

"I'll give you a chance to atone for your guilt," Qian Tong said coldly.

"As the elder commands!" Luo Qing hurriedly replied, putting on a look of utmost devotion.

"You have one hour—hurry to contact every shop in Tianyun City and gather twenty million... no, gather fifty million Saint Crystals."

"Fifty million?" Luo Qing gasped.

"That's right!"

"Yes!" Luo Qing answered and vanished like lightning. Gathering fifty million Saint Crystals in an hour was a colossal task.

Watching Luo Qing disappear, Qian Tong breathed a quiet sigh of relief. Fortunately the auction was being held in Tianyun City, and Yingyue Hall owned many enterprises there, so collecting Saint Crystals wasn't too difficult.

Had the auction been held on another faction's turf, Qian Tong would have been left to sigh in frustration.

Meanwhile, in Jubao Tower's underground chamber, Yan Pei sat pondering for a moment, then smiled slyly. He beckoned the Origin Returning Realm experts who had assessed the treasures and whispered a few words into their ears.

They all nodded and quickly departed.

Moments later, people were seen entering and leaving the A-Class private rooms one after another, their expressions grave. They quickly departed from Jubao Tower, heading straight toward the great hall where Tianyun City’s Space Array was located.

A short while later, people began leaving from the B-Class private rooms as well.

Jubao Tower chose Tianyun City for this auction because a Space Array there connected to the other cities on Dark Star, making it convenient for major factions from different places to come participate.

Space arrays are priceless and not open to ordinary people, but these attendees were from major factions. The Yingyue Hall disciples guarding the array did not dare stop them; after accepting a certain amount of Saint Crystals they permitted its use.
