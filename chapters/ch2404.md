## Chapter 2404 — Bing Yun Gravely Injured

Out at sea, the multi-deck ship sped deeper into the waters. Liu Qianyun and the others stood on the deck, gazing into the distance, their faces filled with deep worry.

Suddenly, Ling Yinqin seemed to notice something. Her beautiful eyes brightened for a moment, and she pointed in a direction, saying, “Someone’s coming.”

Hearing this, Liu Qianyun, Fan Xin, and the others all perked up and looked that way. Sure enough, they saw a streak of light rapidly approaching.

“Prepare for the worst. Be ready to fight at any moment!” Ling Yinqin called out crisply. At her command, everyone’s expression turned serious as they quietly roused their Origin Qi.

If the newcomer was Yang Kai, that would be best. But if it was Pang Guang, they would have to fight to the death.

In a short while, the light drew near. Liu Qianyun cried out in delight, “It’s Senior Brother! It’s Senior Brother!”

She saw clearly that the figure hidden within the light was Yang Kai. The heavy weight in her heart finally lifted, and she felt completely at ease.

When Yang Kai landed on the deck, everyone greeted him with joy, asking after his well-being. Liu Qianyun in particular looked him up and down, afraid he might be missing an arm or a leg.

But after looking him over, everyone found that not only was Yang Kai completely unharmed, he was even full of energy. For a moment, they were all bewildered.

After all, Yang Kai had stayed behind to fight Pang Guang. To battle an Emperor Realm master—even if he managed to escape unscathed—he shouldn’t be in such good condition, should he?

“What about that Pang Guang?” Ling Yinqin asked suspiciously, glancing in the direction Yang Kai had come from, afraid Pang Guang might appear at any moment.

“He’s dead. Don’t worry,” Yang Kai grinned.

“Dead?” Ling Yinqin’s beautiful eyes widened as she exclaimed, “How did he die?”

As soon as she asked, she realized her mistake. Yang Kai had stayed behind to deal with Pang Guang, and now Yang Kai had returned while Pang Guang was dead. How else could he have died? Obviously, Yang Kai killed him.

Realizing this, Ling Yinqin’s heart was shaken to the core.

She had seen Yang Kai take action before, killing Dao Origin Realm cultivators as easily as chopping vegetables, but she never imagined he could even kill an Emperor Realm master. What kind of heaven-defying cultivation and secret techniques did he possess, and what Secret Treasures did he have, to achieve this?

Yang Kai said, “That guy was already seriously injured. His strength was greatly diminished, yet he still thought too highly of himself. That’s why he died.”

Hearing this explanation, Ling Yinqin let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. So Pang Guang was already wounded—no wonder Yang Kai was able to kill him. If even a peak Emperor Realm master wasn’t Yang Kai’s match, that would be too unbelievable.

Even so, Ling Yinqin couldn’t deny Yang Kai’s strength. An injured Emperor Realm master was still an Emperor Realm master. As the saying goes, a skinny camel is still bigger than a horse, yet Yang Kai was able to kill him. He was definitely the most outstanding Dao Origin Realm cultivator she had ever seen.

“Pillmaster Yang, where is my Master?” Fan Xin asked anxiously. “Did you see how she was doing?”

Yang Kai glanced at her and comforted, “You don’t need to worry about Senior Bing Yun. She’ll be fine. Let’s keep moving. Senior Bing Yun will catch up to us.”

Seeing how confident he was, Fan Xin and the other Ice Heart Pavilion disciples couldn’t help but feel more at ease. They believed their Master would have no trouble dealing with Chi Ri.

Soon, everyone went inside the ship’s cabin and continued their journey.

The next several days passed in relative peace. Occasionally, a few reckless sea beasts would approach to cause trouble, but under Yang Kai’s leadership, everyone easily drove them off or slew them.

By now, no one knew how far they were from Tongtian Island. They had long since reached the depths of the Jixu Sea.

But after several days, there was still no sign of Bing Yun!

This made Fan Xin and the others increasingly anxious, worried that something might have happened to their Master.

Yang Kai was also puzzled. Logically, Bing Yun had already recovered to her peak and had several Upper-Level Emperor Yuan Pills he had refined. There was no way she could lose to Chi Ri.

He had thought Bing Yun would quickly force Chi Ri to retreat and then come join them, but now it seemed things weren’t as he expected.

Chi Ri seemed to be even harder to deal with than he had anticipated!

Yang Kai had already learned the location of the secret realm’s exit from Bing Yun, so even if she didn’t return, he could still lead everyone out. But Bing Yun was the founder of Ice Heart Valley and came from the same Star Domain as him—they had a connection. Yang Kai didn’t want to abandon her here. Deep down, he still hoped to see her leave this place with him and return to the Star Realm.

For the past few days, he had stayed on deck—partly to guard against sea beast attacks, and partly to spot Bing Yun as soon as possible.

Five days passed, but Yang Kai’s wish was not fulfilled.

On this day, as he was gazing into the distance from the deck, Fan Xin suddenly rushed out from the cabin, her face full of anxiety. “Pillmaster Yang!”

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai saw her expression and was startled, not knowing what had happened to make her so flustered.

Fan Xin said urgently, “Master sent a distress message. She’s in trouble.”

As she spoke, she handed the Transmission Compass in her hand to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. He quickly took it, sent out his Divine Sense to check, and confirmed Fan Xin’s words. He immediately turned and leapt toward the depths of the sea, saying, “I’ll go get her!”

With Spatial Law activated, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and vanished.

Fan Xin wanted to go with him, but before she could say anything, Yang Kai had already disappeared.

Three thousand li from the ship, a faint light was flying over the sea. The light flickered, as if it could collapse at any moment. Within it, a young woman’s figure was wrapped—Bing Yun.

At this moment, Bing Yun looked utterly miserable. Her once-white clothes were soaked and stained with blood, her beautiful face pale as paper, and the power within her delicate body flickered weakly. She looked as if she was at the end of her strength.

As a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, Bing Yun rarely faced such peril. In fact, since her breakthrough to the Emperor Realm, this was the gravest injury she had ever suffered. Out here on the boundless sea, there was nowhere to rest or recover. The scent of her blood had drawn the sea beasts below, and now they circled relentlessly, refusing to let her escape—like maggots clinging to bone.

And as time passed, more and more sea beasts gathered.

She forced herself to keep flying, but when she could go no further, she finally sent a distress message to her disciples.

With the last bit of strength drained from her body, Bing Yun looked up at the endless sea, a trace of desolation rising in her heart.

She hadn’t expected that after all her hardships traveling from the Hengluo Star Domain to the Star Realm and cultivating to the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, she would end up as food for fish. Such a death was far too pitiful.

Yet, at the brink of life and death, her expression remained cold and resolute, without the slightest panic. It was as if she was facing not death, but another journey of life.

The flickering light finally shattered. Bing Yun could no longer fly forward. Her body swayed and she plummeted headfirst toward the sea.

The sea beasts below, which had been chasing her relentlessly, seemed to sense what was about to happen. They became excited, churning the sea into chaos, each opening its bloody maw to welcome the falling delicacy.

Just as Bing Yun was about to fall into a beast’s mouth, a figure suddenly appeared beneath her in a flash. With a single motion, he caught her and leapt away.

Yang Kai immediately saw how dire Bing Yun’s condition was. The moment he caught her, his hands were met with cold, clammy wetness. He couldn’t help but frown, “How did you end up like this?”

He hadn’t expected Bing Yun to end up in such a miserable state after her battle with Chi Ri. He didn’t know whether Chi Ri was dead or alive, but seeing Bing Yun like this, Chi Ri couldn’t be much better off. Even if he wasn’t dead, he probably didn’t have the strength to pursue them.

Held in Yang Kai’s arms, Bing Yun opened her weak eyes and glanced at him. She seemed to realize he had saved her and quickly gave him a grateful look, then said weakly, “I need to heal. Take me back.”

Her voice was as faint as a mosquito’s, clearly at her limit. If Yang Kai hadn’t been close, he might not have heard her at all.

“Don’t worry, Senior. Just focus on healing.” Yang Kai nodded solemnly. As soon as he finished speaking, he saw Bing Yun had already closed her eyes and lost consciousness.

Yang Kai frowned, changed direction, and sped back toward the multi-deck ship.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai returned to the ship.

Fan Xin and the others had been anxiously waiting on the deck. When they saw Yang Kai carrying Bing Yun back, but Bing Yun’s life or death was uncertain, their hearts were thrown into chaos and their faces turned pale.

Yang Kai quickly said, “Senior is not in mortal danger, just extremely weak. I’ve given her a few Spiritual Pills for healing. Junior Sister Fan, take Senior back to the cabin and look after her!”

“Alright!” Fan Xin had no idea what to do at this point, so she simply did as Yang Kai said. She took Bing Yun from him, and together with the other Ice Heart Pavilion disciples, carefully brought their Master into the cabin.

After Fan Xin and the other Ice Heart Pavilion disciples had carefully settled Bing Yun in the cabin, Ling Yinqin finally approached Yang Kai and quietly asked, “What about Chi Ri? Do you know what state he’s in now?”

Yang Kai shook his head and said in a low voice, “I didn’t see him. But with Senior Bing Yun in this state, Chi Ri is probably in dire straits. Don’t worry, he won’t be coming after us.”

Hearing this, Ling Yinqin finally breathed a sigh of relief.

If Chi Ri were to pursue them now, there would be no way for everyone on the ship to resist. Even though Yang Kai had killed Pang Guang, he would have no chance against Chi Ri.

After all, Chi Ri was a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert.

The ship continued on its way. Because of Bing Yun’s serious injuries, everyone’s spirits were low. The Ice Heart Pavilion disciples disappeared for several days, staying in the cabin to care for Bing Yun.

Yang Kai didn’t disturb them. This was a critical period for Bing Yun’s recovery. As a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, she definitely had her own methods for healing, and there was no need for him to worry.
