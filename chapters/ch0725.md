## Chapter 725 — Yinyun Dao

Yinyun Dao is one of the isles under the jurisdiction of the Water Divine Hall; something unknown must have occurred here long ago, for the island's skies are shrouded in gloomy clouds year-round and sunlight never breaks through. Of every ten days, eight are filled with unending drizzle, and the air is oppressively damp.

He Pu, though only cultivated to the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, was adept at managing relationships; his cultivation rank in the Water Divine Hall was not high, yet he had secured a steward's post.

Now he oversaw the island’s daily operations on Yinyun Dao; with the drizzle unceasing and the weather as foul as ever, He Pu cursed the heavens while directing his brothers to carry the supplies brought by the boats.

Those supplies were destined for Shuishen Dao, to support the Elite Disciples within the hall in their training and daily needs.

Taking advantage of a momentary lapse in attention, He Pu quietly pocketed two Crystal Stones from the cargo, then put on an air of nonchalance and continued issuing orders.

"He Pu, He Pu…" a shout suddenly came from the side; He Pu turned to see one of his subordinates, nicknamed Wuzei, calling to him.

"What is it?" He Pu snapped with a bad temper; he felt guilty about his theft, and the sudden shout had nearly made him break into a cold sweat.

The rules of the Water Divine Hall were strict; even though he was steward of Yinyun Dao, if caught stealing while on duty the lightest punishment would be expulsion from the sect, and the heaviest could mean having his limbs broken.

"He Pu, there's a suspicious little dark dot over there—maybe someone's flying in," the disciple blurted. He was of a roguish, rat-faced sort; Wuzei wasn't his given name but a nickname everyone had picked up, until now no one could even remember his real name, so he was always just called Wuzei.

"Someone?" He Pu narrowed his small, long eyes and looked toward where Wuzei pointed. After a moment he chuckled, "This fool probably doesn't know the island's secret. Ignore him—let him come closer and we'll let him taste the might of our heavens."

"But…what if he dies?" Wuzei asked, a touch anxious.

"Let him die, what the hell is it to me?" He Pu snorted coldly. "Anyone who flies over Yinyun Dao without knowing its mysteries clearly isn't an acquaintance. People like that can die a thousand deaths for all I care." He glanced up at the sullen sky and cursed, "Damn this accursed heaven, it really won't let people live."

Hearing him, Wuzei found it very reasonable and ceased his concern; instead he craned his neck in anticipation, eager to see just how miserably the newcomer would perish.

Yang Kai flew in, and the first thing he saw was Yinyun Dao; he found the island's choking clouds peculiar, sensing faintly that something was off, but a closer inspection revealed nothing overtly unusual.

His figure became a streak of light as he rapidly closed on Yinyun Dao.

There were many people over there who seemed to have noticed him; on the shore they pointed and whispered. The distance was far, the sea wind blew hard, waves rolled, and Yang Kai could not catch what they were saying.

Moments later Yang Kai arrived above Yinyun Dao, and the people onshore abruptly fell silent, each regarding him with a look of pity.

Yang Kai frowned; he couldn't tell what they intended, but he detected no hostility. Just as he prepared to descend, a crisp cracking sound came from above his head.

In an instant Yang Kai felt a surging current of electricity strike downward and hit the crown of his head.

The force was so great his body crouched, and he nearly toppled into the sea.

Electricity coursed through him, making his hairs stand on end; Yang Kai shivered, and then an unparalleled sense of ease rose within him.

The Wind-and-Thunder Wings seemed to draw in a great deal of that lightning, storing its power at the right shoulder blade on his back.

Those below gave a cry of astonishment, which quickly fell silent; one by one they stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Being struck by a bolt as thick as an arm and suffering only hair standing on end, with no other injury, was something they found impossible to accept.

Yinyun Dao's peculiarity lay not only in the perpetual gloom but in the immense lightning power contained within those clouds. Ordinarily the clouds did not release lightning; only when a living being approached would that electrical force be triggered.

Thus Yinyun Dao, positioned at the outermost reach of the Water Divine Hall, served not only as a transfer point for supplies but as a natural defensive barrier.

Anyone who flew in blindly without knowing the truth would receive a baptism of lightning.

Such heavenly might was something even the elders of the Water Divine Hall could not withstand.

Every half year the elders employed special methods to let the lightning power accumulated in the clouds discharge; otherwise the buildup might one day erupt and destroy the whole island.

He Pu recalled the elders' last discharge had been several months ago; after such a long accumulation the lightning in the clouds should have reached a level that even Transcendent Realm experts would avoid, so why was that youngster unharmed?

Lost in thought, he watched as lightning after lightning descended from the clouds like spiritual snakes, fanged and writhing; no matter the angle they struck, they found Yang Kai with uncanny precision.

The crackling never ceased, and the light blazed as bright as day, blinding to the eyes.

He Pu squinted to get a better look, but he could see nothing clearly.

That scene persisted for who knew how long, until at last the strikes thinned and their force diminished; only then could everyone see the sky again.

Exclamations rose anew as they discovered the intruder was still firmly hovering in midair—unharmed and, oddly, his face bearing an expression of extreme calm.

"He Pu, is that man struck stupid by lightning?" Wuzei crept forward and whispered.

He Pu was stunned; he had no idea how to make sense of what he was seeing.

If the youth wasn't struck dumb, then his strength must be so profound that he could simply ignore the lightning's force!

But how could that be? The elders had said such heavenly might would compel even those at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm to make a hasty retreat. This kid looked only twenty-three or twenty-four—could he truly be that powerful?

Lost in their astonishment, they watched as the young man slowly shook his head, showing a trace of disappointment; he straightened his clothes and strolled down to the island.

Faces changed instantly; everyone drew on True Yuan and took up a cautious stance.

Sensing their guardedness, Yang Kai grinned, revealing a row of white teeth and a harmless smile, then landed steadily on the island.

"Who are you?" He Pu asked coldly, sizing Yang Kai up. He seemed unfamiliar; He Pu realized he had never seen him before.

Anyone who entered or left the Water Divine Hall first set foot on Yinyun Dao; if the newcomer were known, He Pu would certainly have recognized him.

"Is this the Water Divine Hall?" Yang Kai replied with a question, glancing around and noting, to his surprise, that there wasn't a single Transcendent expert on the isle—most present were only of the Divine Roaming Realm.

"Indeed!" He Pu nodded. "This is the Water Divine Hall's Yinyun Dao. Who are you, sir? What brings you to our Water Divine Hall?"

Yang Kai's outrageous arrival had made He Pu wary; the young man didn't seem easy to provoke, but duty compelled He Pu to inquire about his identity and purpose.

"Don't misunderstand, I mean no harm," Yang Kai replied with a slight smile. "I'm here to find someone."

"Looking for someone?" He Pu frowned. "Who are you searching for?"

"A girl named Shui Ling. If I'm not mistaken, she should be the daughter of your hallmaster."

"Looking for the little princess?" He Pu's eyes bulged and his expression twisted oddly; he let out a chuckle.

The others cast ambiguous, suggestive glances at Yang Kai.

"Yes, I'm looking for your little princess," Yang Kai nodded. "If convenient, could you tell me where she is? Better yet, could you take me to meet her?"

"Kid!" He Pu smiled with a hint of relish. "I don't know what faction you belong to, but you do seem to have some skill. I won't make things hard for you—just go back where you came from. Our little princess isn't one someone like you can approach."

Saying this, He Pu waved a hand as if dismissing Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned and asked, "Have you misunderstood something?"

He Pu curled his lip. "Everyone who comes here always says the same. You're just after my little princess. I'm not going to waste my time—our little princess is a beauty; it's natural for you youngsters to fancy her. Brother's been through it too," he added with a sigh, "but I won't make exceptions. If you don't leave now, don't blame us when we're not polite with you."

Yang Kai drew a quiet breath and smiled wryly; he felt these people had truly misunderstood him.

Shui Ling, though indeed attractive and delightfully impish, had never been the object of his romantic longing.

In Zhongdu the two had gone from enemies to friends, and when he took her back to the Tongxuan Continent their bond had deepened.

Yang Kai believed Shui Ling harbored no romantic feelings toward him.

Thinking this, he took something from the Black Book Space and handed it over. "Take a look at this."

He Pu glanced, took it casually, and upon seeing it more closely he couldn't help but exclaim, "The little princess's token? Where did you get that?"

"Nonsense—she gave it to me," Yang Kai snorted.

He Pu's eyes widened and he slapped his forehead as if remembering something. "Right, so you're the one the little princess told me about—ah, my apologies, brother, my apologies. If you'd shown that token earlier I wouldn't have made things difficult for you."

"No matter," Yang Kai shook his head and asked with curiosity, "What did your little princess instruct you to do?"

"Three years ago, when the little princess returned, she told me that if a young gentleman came bearing her token we were to treat him with courtesy."
