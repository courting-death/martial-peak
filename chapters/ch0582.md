## Chapter 583 — The Sky Is About to Change

Over the past month, dozens of casualties had occurred in the Cangyun Evil Land, and the survivors, under the command of the Evil Lord Yang Bai, had completely withdrawn, no longer making any moves.

During this month of entanglement between Yang Kai’s manor and the Cangyun Evil Land, the Eight Great Families also gained a brief respite to regroup. Although they occasionally cooperated with Yang Kai’s actions to harass the Cangyun Evil Land’s forces, they refrained from large-scale mobilization since, to this day, the Eight Great Families could not fathom Yang Kai’s intentions.

The entire Zhongdu had already become a tripartite state of stalemate among Yang Kai’s manor, the Eight Great Families, and the Cangyun Evil Land.

The relationships among these three were entangled and intricate, impossible to see through.

Naturally, the Eight Great Families and the Cangyun Evil Land were mortal enemies, while Yang Kai’s manor, caught in the middle, often launched attacks against the Cangyun Evil Land. Yet, the people within the manor did not trust the Eight Great Families at all; sometimes, if someone from the Eight Great Families provoked them, they would strike back fiercely without hesitation.

Fortunately, the family heads of the Eight Great Families had ordered their elite forces not to provoke Yang Kai’s manor, insisting that any conflicts on the battlefield be tolerated with patience and restraint.

At such a critical moment, the Eight Great Families did not want further conflicts with Yang Kai’s manor.

Thus, all spoils of war on the battlefield belonged entirely to Yang Kai’s manor—the pills and mystery-grade secret treasures seized from the dead Cangyun Evil Land warriors were all collected by Yang Kai’s forces, with the Eight Great Families receiving not even a single hair.

The astonishing reputation of Yang Kai’s manor spread rapidly.

A month later, vast numbers of warriors gathered outside Yang Kai’s manor, creating such a commotion that Qiu Yimeng noticed it. After checking outside, she immediately sought out Yang Kai.

“What is it?” he asked.

“There are many people outside.”

“Who are they?” Yang Kai frowned, his expression darkening—he had assumed they came to cause trouble.

“They are all here to pledge allegiance to you.”

“To pledge allegiance to me?” Yang Kai was taken aback, then chuckled. “This isn’t a Succession War.”

Qiu Yimeng gave him a sharp look. “These are all first-rate forces summoned by the Eight Great Families to reinforce Zhongdu.”

“Why would they come to me if summoned by the Eight Great Families?” Yang Kai’s expression grew strange.

“Don’t play dumb!” Qiu Yimeng snorted. “It’s because this place is safe. Before we arrived, some first-rate forces had already come to reinforce Zhongdu, but those forces were almost entirely wiped out—the elite from each family and sect suffered heavy casualties. Learning from past mistakes, the forces coming now no longer dare to expect protection from the Eight Great Families.”

“So, they come to me instead?” Yang Kai’s expression turned serious.

“That’s right.” Qiu Yimeng nodded slightly. “Besides, there’s already a precedent in the manor.”

“You mean the Lü Family?” Yang Kai instantly understood.

“The Lü Family’s elite were also sent to reinforce Zhongdu, but ended up under your name. During this period, none of them died; instead, they killed many Cangyun Evil Land warriors.” Qiu Yimeng smiled with schadenfreude. “You made the precedent yourself—now everyone is coming to you. Let’s see how you handle this.”

“I see...” Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

He had kept the Lü Family because he had some rapport with Lü Si. The Lü Family’s elite were not weak, so he allowed them to stay in the manor. But if all the other reinforcing forces converged in his manor, not to mention whether his residence was large enough to hold them, even if it were, having so many people living together would inevitably breed conflict.

After some thought, Yang Kai grinned: “Since they come to pledge allegiance, take them all in.”

Qiu Yimeng stared at him in surprise—given Yang Kai’s character, she had expected him to drive them all away, yet he gave such an answer.

After pondering for a moment, her expression turned teasing: “Your appetite is really big.”

“This is an opportunity,” Yang Kai sneered coldly. “Zhongdu and the Eight Great Families need a change of blood.”

Qiu Yimeng’s beautiful eyes brightened with silent anticipation as she hurried outside to begin arrangements.

On the Eight Great Families’ side, looking toward the crowded Yang Kai manor, all wore grim expressions. These forces came under the summons of the Eight Great Families to reinforce Zhongdu. But now, they were unwilling to fight alongside the Eight Great Families and instead flocked to Yang Kai.

The family heads of the Eight Great Families could not help but feel subtle resentment—as if sewing a wedding dress for others.

“The sky is about to change!” Kang Rui sighed slightly, seeming to foresee the future situation.

The entire world’s forces rejected and distrusted the Eight Great Families, while flocking to Yang Kai’s manor—a sharp contrast.

If things continued thus, the prestige of the Eight Great Families would be utterly destroyed, replaced by the newly rising manor of Yang Kai.

Once this crisis passed, who would Zhongdu belong to?

“You, Old Yang Family... have produced an extraordinary figure.” Several family heads looked at Yang Yinghao with envy and jealousy.

Yang Yinghao’s mouth twitched slightly, sighing: “Let’s hope he still remembers his own bloodline.”

Yang Kai’s manor was lively beyond compare; all forces coming to pledge allegiance were brought into the Heavenly Journey Palace. Inside this barrier, everyone exhaled deeply, feeling a strong guarantee of safety.

Taking a closer look at the power of Yang Kai’s manor, they all obediently followed Qiu Yimeng’s directions without any objection.

With so many arriving at once, the already cramped manor grew even more crowded.

The new forces were mostly arranged family by family or sect by sect into separate courtyards, each finding a place to sit cross-legged, lacking even their own rooms or beds.

Yet no one complained—having a place to stay inside Yang Kai’s manor was enough satisfaction.

More and more forces requested to join Yang Kai’s manor; Yang Kai accepted them all.

All these forces were here to fight the Cangyun Evil Land. Even though the Eight Great Families were annoyed, they dared not stop them for fear of ruining morale.

As time passed, the front of Yang Kai’s manor gradually calmed, and the manor’s capacity neared saturation. Over two thousand powerful experts had gathered, including seventeen original Transcendent Realm masters, along with ten more who each came from a first-rate force—their strongest trump cards.

The rapid growth of Yang Kai’s manor alarmed both the Eight Great Families and the Cangyun Evil Land.

A cool night breeze blew as two groups arrived at Yang Kai’s manor, converging just outside.

From the left came two women: one stunningly enchanting, the other lively and lovely—Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo and Bilo.

From the right came eight family heads of the Eight Great Families.

Upon encountering each other, Ye Kuangren immediately shouted angrily, “Enchantress Queen!”

True Yuan surged; it was clear they intended to fight here. The other seven also glared hostilely at Shan Qingluo.

Shan Qingluo hurriedly took a few steps back, secretly gathering her strength, her heart anxious. She hadn’t expected the eight to approach stealthily like her, resulting in this sudden confrontation.

“Enchantress, what business do you have here?” Kang Rui demanded sharply.

Shan Qingluo said nothing, watching all eight warily.

“Don’t waste words on her. She came here on her own—just kill her.” Gao Mo sneered.

Everyone nodded silently, ready to act, when suddenly someone stepped out from Yang Kai’s manor, raising their voice.

“Please, come in. Yang Kai says guests are to be treated as honored guests, so please do not act recklessly outside the manor!”

Hearing this, the family heads’ expressions turned strange. Qiu Shoucheng stared in disbelief at the person who emerged from the manor and said with difficulty, “Meng’er!”

“Father!” Qiu Yimeng remained calm, bowing slightly to Qiu Shoucheng, then addressed them: “You must be here to discuss important matters with Yang Kai. He is already waiting in the side hall. Please come in.”

She stepped aside, gesturing politely.

“Humph!” Ye Kuangren scoffed, glaring coldly at Shan Qingluo. “I’ll spare your life this time; don’t let me see you again.”

With that, he strode forward.

The Heavenly Journey Palace’s barrier split open, and the eight entered one after another. After their departure, Qiu Yimeng smiled at Shan Qingluo: “Sister, why don’t you come in as well?”

“Does Yang Kai know why I came?” Shan Qingluo smiled bitterly.

“I don’t know. He only said guests had arrived, so I came to greet them. I didn’t expect... it would be these guests.” Qiu Yimeng’s heart ached. If she had known the eight family heads were coming, she would have refused to greet them—after all, her father was among them.

“That brat does everything so secretively,” Shan Qingluo scoffed.

Qiu Yimeng’s expression suddenly turned dreamy. She stared at Shan Qingluo intently, her beautiful eyes shining with a different light.

Shan Qingluo’s face slightly changed, and she hurriedly suppressed her charm.

Qiu Yimeng suddenly came back to herself, a wave of terror flashing through her heart. The Enchantress Queen’s allure was something even women could not resist.

Inside the side hall, the eight family heads took separate seats, and Shan Qingluo also arrived, sitting calmly on the opposite side. Though the eight were hostile toward her, she knew Yang Kai would never let her come to harm.

At this moment, none of the eight had the heart to bother Shan Qingluo; all were transfixed by the imposing figure of Yang Kai sitting at the head of the room. Their emotions were complicated and subtle.

They did not know how this second-generation disciple of the Yang Family, who was a whole generation younger, had grown to be honored as an equal in conversation with them!

Even more astonishingly, he had done it in barely over a year. None of his peers could catch up with him; they could only look up from behind, never reaching his level in this lifetime.

Even Liu Qingyao, once hailed as Zhongdu’s number one, paled in comparison before him.

All eight were deeply shocked and astonished.

A maid from the manor brought tea. The eight took their cups and drank, but could taste nothing but bitterness spreading on their tongues.
