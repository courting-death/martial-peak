## Chapter 1129 — Saint King Pill

Seeing Yu Feng's smug, triumphant look, Wu Yi shot him a white-eyed glare. "Don't make a fool of yourself. How did the materials you bought turn out?"

"Oh, I bought them — they're all here." Yu Feng said as he handed the Spatial Ring in his hand to Yang Yan.

Yang Yan took it casually, swept it with her Divine Sense, and nodded: "Not bad. With these materials, give me another month and I can guard this place with formations; then no matter how many come it'll be safe!"

Wu Yi and Yu Feng looked at her in astonishment, but Wu Yi soon shook her head and turned to Yu Feng, asking, "What are you holding?"

"Young Master Wu Ke gave it to me to deliver to Yang Kai." Yu Feng explained: when he had returned he had seen Wu Ke lingering outside the cave. He went up to ask, and before he knew it Wu Ke had shoved this jade box into his hands, saying only that Elder Ba wanted to send it to Yang Kai, then vanished in a flash.

Wu Yi's brows knit as if she recalled something; she fixed her gaze on the jade box and said, "Open it and let me see."

Yu Feng lifted the lid of the jade box, and a refreshing fragrance immediately drifted through the cave.

"Saint King Pill?" Wu Yi and Yu Feng both exclaimed. Wu Yi inwardly approved — the family was truly generous to take the last Saint King Pill from storage to give — while Yu Feng kept swallowing, his eyes shining with greedy light.

Yang Yan, for her part, merely glanced once at the Saint King Pill, then focused on her own work.

"Are you sure Elder Ba had cousin bring this?" Wu Yi asked uncertainly.

"Yes — otherwise where would I have gotten it?" Yu Feng replied.

"Looks like the family wants to ingratiate themselves with Yang Kai..." Wu Yi murmured, then smiled lightly. "Fair enough; as long as they're not completely senile, it's sensible to make friends. But they only sent my cousin — they're clearly holding something back. Never mind, put the Saint King Pill inside; Yang Kai will need it."

Had it been anything else, Wu Yi might have insisted Yu Feng return it, but the Saint King Pill was different.

"Mm." Yu Feng carefully closed the jade box and then walked inside.

At the stone chamber where Yang Kai dwelt, before Yu Feng could speak Yang Kai's voice carried out: "Brother Yu, come in."

Yu Feng grinned and stepped in, handed over the jade box, and recounted how he had obtained it.

"A Saint King Pill..." Yang Kai looked at the dragon-eye-sized Pill in the box with amusement; as an alchemist he naturally knew what a Saint King Pill was for.

From entering the Saint Realm to ascending to the Saint King Realm, consuming a Saint King Pill could greatly help a martial artist stabilize both their cultivation and state of mind. Because such Pills only work at this specific juncture, they were called Saint King Pills.

The Saint King Pill is a Saint King-Grade, Middle-Level Pill — not the top tier, but the materials required are considerable.

Essentially every major realm breakthrough and consolidation has Pills to assist a martial artist, but Yang Kai, due to his World-Ending Demon Eye and the vast insight he'd absorbed from high-grade fighters into Dao and martial understanding, had never relied on Pills for breakthroughs or stabilization; he didn't need them.

He didn't need them, but others did — to ordinary fighters these Pills were precious treasures.

The Haike Family presenting a Saint King Pill was clearly a gesture of goodwill and an attempt to draw him close, which Yang Kai understood. It might have worked on someone else, but they had given it to the wrong person.

Yang Kai himself was an alchemist; a Pill of that sort could be refined in the time two incense sticks burned. His Black Book Space contained ample spiritual herbs and medicines.

Seeing Yu Feng staring at the Saint King Pill with envy, Yang Kai placed the pill back into the jade box and casually tossed the box to him: "You eat it."

"Ah?" Yu Feng was startled. Taking the box, he waved his hands: "No, this won't do — this was the family's gift to you. Such a Pill is exceedingly precious; the Haike Family once had an alchemist refine a few, and Miss used one upon ascending to the Saint King Realm; as far as I know this is the last one."

"If I tell you to take it, then take it — I have no use for it." Yang Kai shook his head.

"But I ascended to the Saint King Realm two or three years ago; taking it now would greatly reduce its efficacy." Yu Feng could not bear the thought of wasting such a fine Pill.

"Then it's yours. Eat it or sell it — decide for yourself." Yang Kai smiled.

“Brother Yang, you really don’t want it? If you refuse like this, I won’t be able to give a proper explanation to the family.”

"Haven't you already left the Haike Family? What need is there to explain?" Yang Kai said with amusement.

Yu Feng froze for a moment, slapped his forehead: "Oh right..."

He suddenly remembered he had already broken ties with the family, and his expression dimmed.

Yang Kai reassured him: "Leaving the Haike Family may not be a bad thing. Rest assured, you'll have better cultivation conditions here with me than you did with the Haike Family."

Yu Feng thanked him politely: "Many thanks for your kindness, Brother Yang. I don't mind myself, only Miss... ah!"

He was clearly more worried about Wu Yi, and he didn't take Yang Kai's words entirely to heart; he'd seen Yang Kai's combat prowess, but was still uncertain Yang could truly provide superior training conditions.

After Yu Feng left, Yang Kai pondered for a moment and sent out a thought.

Before long the Stone Puppet burrowed up from beneath the ground.

After several busy days it had gathered a good number of Ethereal Crystals; once Yang Kai told it to spit them all out, he then ordered it to drop the matter and instead open several more stone chambers inside the cave.

Wu Yi and Yu Feng were effectively homeless and could only live here; they had been dragged into this by their former ties, and Yang Kai naturally would not abandon them.

The Stone Puppet's pace in excavating the chambers was extraordinarily fast, and with its simple mind it worked relentlessly — it only ceased when Yang Kai remembered to stop it, by which time the entire cave had changed beyond recognition.

One chamber after another stood neatly arranged along both sides of the cave's passage, each the same size and indistinguishable from the next, as if measured with the most precise ruler down to the zhang.

The cave contained fully several hundred chambers.

Yang Kai swept them with his Divine Sense and gave a dry laugh, telling the Stone Puppet to continue mining Ethereal ore before turning away.

While consolidating his Saint King Realm in seclusion, Yang Kai also refined the new purple shield Secret Treasure Yang Yan had crafted; Xu Zhishen's Hundred Mountains Painting had given him a fright — simply manifesting six mountain phantoms carried such force that if a hundred were unleashed the surrounding thousand li would likely be utterly destroyed.

Yang Kai urgently needed a defensive Secret Treasure.

After Yang Yan and the other two organized the materials, they too were shocked by the cave's transformation — in merely a day or two hundreds of identical chambers had appeared, leaving Wu Yi and Yu Feng feeling as if in a dream.

They suspected Yang Kai had pulled some trick, but detected no movement; only Yang Yan's eyes flicked as she realized it was the Stone Puppet's doing.

With the extra chambers, Wu Yi and Yu Feng each selected one as their lodgings. Yang Yan then took out some Saint Crystals and arranged a small spirit formation inside their chambers so they could cultivate better, and only after that began arranging the defensive grand formation.

Fortunately Wu Yi cultivated a fire-attributed technique; though inexperienced in forging, under Yang Yan's guidance she could still produce some simple items.

The Stone Puppet was busiest of all — sent by Yang Kai to gather Ethereal Crystals and then summoned back by Yang Yan, it was dazed from toil. It was both fast and excellent at tempering materials; who else could do it as well?

Yang Yan saved a vast amount of time and effort. She had never enjoyed such a perfect forging process; with a Stone Puppet as assistant she only needed to shape materials and inscribe the spirit formations within, no extraneous labor required.

Half a month later Yang Kai emerged from seclusion.

The instant he stepped out of his chamber he sensed the place was different.

There had originally been only he and Yang Yan, and later Wu Yi and Yu Feng joined — just four people in total — yet now the cave held at least forty people.

Some cultivated in the chambers while others helped with tasks; the whole of Dragon Lair Mountain was bustling.

What was happening?

Yang Kai walked out puzzled; everyone he met greeted him warmly, and to his surprise he recognized them all — even if not by name, their faces were familiar.

They were the people who had once followed Wu Yi on the warship; the last time the cave was arranged they had helped under Yu Feng's guidance.

"Yang Kai!" Wu Yi's voice called out, and Yang Kai smiled as he walked toward her.

In half a month Wu Yi's complexion had greatly improved; the worry between her brows was gone, and she looked youthful and radiant, alive with joy.

"These people..." Yang Kai asked, bewildered.

"They all came to follow me," Wu Yi said apologetically, "and they've all declared they left the family."

"Ah?" Yang Kai was astonished; he hadn't expected Wu Yi's appeal to be so strong. One or two men might follow her out of admiration and even leave the Haike Family, but more than forty people — men and women both — leaving could only be explained by her reputation and character.

Leaving a family without permission was no small matter, and so many leaving at once was like slapping the Haike Family dozens of times across the face! Whether the Haike Family could tolerate such an affront was uncertain.

"I'm sorry, I didn't expect it to come to this," Wu Yi said, burdened with guilt; when she announced her departure it was to shelter Yang Kai and because she could no longer stomach the family's conduct. She hadn't expected it to start a trend that drew over forty people to follow her — she felt both overwhelmed and deeply moved.
