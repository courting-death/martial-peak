## Chapter 994 — A Grand Gift

How did he do it? How could that possibly have happened?

Shen Tu, clutching the key Yang Kai had tossed him, stood staring blankly at the blood-colored mist roiling through the air, a tempest of shock surging up from the depths of his heart.

Even if it were him against Ke Meng, it would be hard to say who would come out on top; how could Yang Kai, having only just reached the First Stage of the Saint Realm, instantly slaughter Ke Meng?

Even a careless Ke Meng would not be completely without means of resistance; his realm and strength were plain to see.

Everything had happened so suddenly that Shen Tu was taken utterly off guard.

He stood there like a fool, drowned in astonishment, forgetting his own predicament and forgetting to unlock his shackles.

Only at that moment did he realize that Yang Kai was an extremely dangerous man; that he could kill Ke Meng in an instant meant that if Shen Tu let his guard down, he himself would be dispatched in the blink of an eye.

Shen Tu was nearly driven to shout out in shock.

“How long are you going to stand there dazed?” Yang Kai's low command carried over.

Shen Tu snapped back to his senses, hurriedly using the key to unlock the shackles binding him. The next moment, countless bolts of lightning suddenly unfurled from within him—clear, distinct streams like fanged serpents—wrapping him as if he were encased in electric snakes; the sight was terrifying.

The uncanny electric serpents crawled across his skin and then shot forth in all directions; in an instant, the entire engine room shimmered with arcs of electricity.

Shen Tu laughed wildly and ferociously, “Brother, you sure know how to have fun—I admire you to death!”

He laughed as his figure vanished from where he stood, only to reappear in the next moment beside a Purple Star cultivator of the First Stage of the Saint Realm.

That Purple Star cultivator had been bearing a fierce expression as he tried to sneak up on Yang Kai, but Shen Tu seized him by the throat.

Wild lightning began to surge; the cultivator trembled violently as that immense, soul-numbing energy poured into his body, instantly stripping him of control over himself.

A smell of burning filled the air; smoke curled up from the man's head. When Shen Tu released him, he lay scorched and charred—nothing left but a corpse on the floor, life completely gone.

The engine room was the crucial chamber of the warship, its heart, so its defenses were usually extremely tight and guarded by Saint King Realm experts to prevent accidents.

But this time, attention had been paid too much to the Sword Alliance's side; most of the strong experts stationed here had been sent out to reinforce them, leaving only a few behind, of whom Ke Meng was the most formidable.

Ke Meng was the first to die. The others, faced with Yang Kai—who was using Demon God Transformation—and the freed Shen Tu fighting together, had no strength left to resist.

Relying on his mighty flesh and the surprise of his attacks, Yang Kai swiftly slew five Saint Realm cultivators. After circling the engine room, he found only himself and Shen Tu still alive; the last cultivator, seeing the situation, attempted to flee but Shen Tu unleashed a bolt of lightning that felled him, then proceeded to trample him to death.

“Finally free! Hahaha!” Shen Tu roared, like a beast that had broken its chains.

“Which way are we going? You know this place better—lead the way,” Yang Kai said coldly.

“We're not in a hurry. Before we leave, let’s give Purple Star a little present!” Shen Tu said suddenly with a strange smile and a hint of madness in his eyes.

He crawled into the central formation of the engine room and sat cross-legged in the middle.

He cast out his divine intent and began to circulate his internal power, linking himself with the central formation.

Yang Kai watched him with a peculiar expression. He did not stop him, only waited quietly.

Having been trapped in the engine room for days, he had gained a certain understanding of these massive warship secret treasures and knew the function of the formation Shen Tu now occupied.

It was the hub array that controlled the warship.

Shen Tu clearly intended to use this Upper-Level Saint King-class warship for some purpose.

The formation’s patterns lit up, and the warship that had been anchored in a corner of the Starry Sky slowly shifted its course, then came to a halt a moment later.

“Heh heh, today I’ll make you all know that Old Shen Tu is not to be trifled with!” Shen Tu's eyes snapped open, a streak of madness in them, and the power within him burst forth, pouring into the array beneath him.

The next moment, the hull shuddered violently.

A vast divine light suddenly shot out from within the ship, carrying an aura of annihilation, and streaked straight toward that chaotic battlefield.

At the same time, Yang Kai keenly sensed that the Saint Crystals placed within the array in the engine room had their stored energy instantly diminished; their previously radiant glow dimmed significantly.

The divine light surged forth. Those in the midst of the fray—the Sword Alliance and Purple Star cultivators—halted in their tracks, horror-struck as the growing beam filled their view. They cried out as they hurriedly raised their flying Secret Treasures and fled in panic.

But it was too late; the divine light moved with incredible speed and in the blink of an eye descended upon those cultivators.

The world fell silent.

The clamorous sounds of battle and fierce clashes ceased at that instant. The survivors stared in stunned silence at the apocalyptic scene, mouths agape, their throats exposed to the air as if they could not speak.

The divine light pierced through the battlefield and shot off toward a distant corner of the boundless cosmos.

It left a vast area utterly cleansed.

There, many cultivators had been unleashing their powers and deploying their Secret Treasures, locked in desperate combat; now there was nothing.

It was as if they had never existed.

At least a hundred people were erased without a trace by that beam of divine light.

Inside the engine room, Shen Tu laughed with ferocity, as if he had done something truly marvelous.

Yang Kai frowned; though he felt uneasy that Shen Tu had taken vengeance by wiping out many of the Sword Alliance cultivators as well, he said nothing.

He had no ties with the Sword Alliance; even He Miao had been merely a passing acquaintance—he saw no reason to intervene.

“Satisfied?” Yang Kai barked. “If you’re done, let's leave quickly. With what you just did, experts will be coming to inspect this place soon.”

“You’re right!” Shen Tu suddenly came to his senses, leapt up from the hub array, and together with Yang Kai dashed outward.

Only a few cultivators remained active within the warship, and the flash of divine light had alarmed many; they all rushed toward the engine room.

Shen Tu seemed to be well acquainted with the ship's layout and led Yang Kai along paths where no one would pass.

They encountered no obstacles along the way and met with no trouble.

“Where are we going? This doesn't look like the way off the ship,” Yang Kai asked with a somber face after following Shen Tu for a while.

Though unfamiliar with the place, his own sharp instincts told him that Shen Tu was not trying to lead him out quickly; instead, they were winding through the vessel.

“Leave?” Shen Tu whispered as he concealed his aura and moved, glancing back at him. “Do you have a correct Star Chart?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

“How can you leave without a Star Chart?” Shen Tu chuckled. “You have a Star Shuttle, right?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded, “but I heard my Star Shuttle is damaged and cannot imprint a Star Chart.”

“No matter. We'll seize someone and have them take us out.” Shen Tu was unconcerned.

“Who should we take? If any random person would do, there's a cultivator of the Second Stage of the Saint Realm about fifty zhang to the left; we could capture him,” Yang Kai suggested.

Shen Tu shook his head. “He won't do. Even if we capture him, we still couldn't leave the Chaos Abyss. You know what happens if you get lost in the Chaos Abyss—my goals go beyond merely escaping this ship.”

Yang Kai's expression changed as he suddenly realized, “You mean to seize the ship's chart-maker?”

“Talking to a smart person is never a chore,” Shen Tu grinned. “That's exactly who I'm after.”

“Do you know where he lives?”

“I know roughly where. Whether we can find him depends on luck.”

Yang Kai fell silent and trailed behind Shen Tu, moving stealthily.

He recalled Shen Tu's earlier information about chart-makers: in the vast starry void there were people who specialized in drawing Star Charts for a living—these were the chart-makers.

A skilled chart-maker could draw Star Charts that allowed cultivators to precisely avoid hidden dangers in the starry sky and reliably arrive at their destination; their charts were so exact that even long voyages contained little error.

Each chart-maker's charts differed slightly; some were excellent, others inferior, and the prices varied accordingly.

They might cost tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of Saint Crystals for the expensive ones, while cheap charts could be bought for only a few crystals.

Masterful chart-makers were highly sought after within any major power and held honored status; they might not be powerful fighters, but they were treated like distinguished guests.

Warships often kept a chart-maker on board, because a ship's course could change at any time and one needed a chart-maker to determine safe routes and whether danger lay ahead.

Becoming a chart-maker was far more difficult than becoming an alchemist or artificer, for chart-makers had to grasp the structure of the entire starry void and memorize the positions and distances between countless stars.

Chart-making was one of the rarest professions across the starry void, typically passed down within a single lineage and impossible to mass-produce.

Every chart-maker's growth required a dedicated master to spend long years guiding and instructing them.

It consumed immense time and energy; a distinguished chart-maker might only accept one or two disciples at most, for more would be impossible to teach properly.

The foundational Star Charts held by renowned chart-makers were the core of their legacy and were seldom transmitted lightly.

All this information about chart-makers flashed through Yang Kai's mind, and he suddenly realized how extraordinary the profession truly was.
