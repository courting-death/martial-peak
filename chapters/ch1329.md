## Chapter 1329 — Repay Grudges

In the blink of an eye, the burly man had already been hauled over to Yang Kai's side; his bovine eyes widened, his face a mask of terror.

He was, after all, a cultivator of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, yet before this young man of equal cultivation, he found himself utterly powerless to resist — the realization sent a chill down his spine. Only now did he seem to remember to fight back, but just as his Saint Yuan began to gather, Yang Kai lightly placed a palm on his shoulder. The burly man gave a muffled grunt, his face turning pale, and the power within his body instantly scattered, unable to condense again.

Yang Kai swept out with another kick, sending the man flying toward Yu Feng and the others. With a casual motion, he snatched the long whip from the man’s hand and tossed it to Yu Feng, his voice cold as he said, “If you have grievances, avenge them. If you have hatred, repay it.”

Yu Feng took the three-finger-thick whip, paused for a moment, then snapped back to his senses. He exchanged looks with his battered companions and, grinning ferally, motioned to encircle the burly man.

In the next moment, the sounds of fists, boots and lashes filled the air, mixed with the burly man's piercing screams and cries for mercy.

Xie Quan's face turned iron-gray, a murderous light flashing in his eyes as if he wanted to tear someone apart; he inclined his head to Yang Kai and said, "Good—this youth's veins run hot and fierce. I'll see how long your arrogance lasts!"

No sooner had his words fallen than silhouettes erupted from all directions—dozens at the very least—surrounding the ruined Juyuan Hall, glaring at Yang Kai and his group. Though none of them were cultivators of the Origin Returning Realm, their numbers alone caused Chang Qi and Hao An's faces to shift.

Moreover, people from every corner of Tianyun City were streaking this way, including no small number of experts from the Origin Returning Realm.

In little time the situation turned sharply against them; Yang Kai and his companions, who had enjoyed a slight advantage, now found themselves utterly outmatched in both numbers and cultivation.

Chang Qi scanned the surroundings, his face darkening as he realized seven or eight Origin Returning Realm cultivators had gathered—obviously reinforcements called by Xie Quan. He had anticipated allies might be summoned before coming; after all, they had walked into a tiger's den. Still, he hadn't expected such a show of force.

He stole a glance at Yang Kai and was shocked to find him unnervingly calm and composed, confident as if he had a plan in his chest—something that both surprised Chang Qi and infected him with a measure of courage. He wondered what reserve Yang Kai might have held back.

"Brother Xie, was it this brat who destroyed the Juyuan Hall?" An elder with a goat's beard who had rushed over greeted Xie Quan, then coldly fixed his gaze on Yang Kai and demanded.

Xie Quan cupped his fist and said sorrowfully, "I'm ashamed—indeed this brat wrecked it. I never expected he would be flanked by two Origin Returning Realm cultivators. I alone could not stand against them and failed to protect it. Once this matter is settled, I shall apologize to your hall."

The goateed elder chuckled and waved his hand. “Brother Xie, you exaggerate. It’s just a minor Juyuan Hall — so it’s destroyed, what of it? My Yingyue Hall is vast and prosperous; we can afford such a loss. But Brother Xie, it seems that junior of yours is in a rather unfavorable situation, isn’t he?”

As he spoke he looked toward the burly man being beaten by Yu Feng and the others, his expression growing grim as he said, "Now that we're here and you still dare to commit violence, aren't you being a bit too insolent? Cease at once!"

As he finished, a flash of keen light swept from his eyes and a majestic Divine Sense descended from the heavens, enveloping Yu Feng and the others.

At the same time, Chang Qi laughed and likewise emitted his own Divine Sense; the two Divine Senses brushed in midair and silently canceled each other. Both being of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, Chang Qi would not be cowed—this clash was a contest of equals.

Yu Feng and the others paused their beating and looked up at Yang Kai. They had never before been surrounded by so many Origin Returning Realm experts and felt unease creep into their hearts.

"Keep beating him—stop when you're satisfied!" Yang Kai cast a glance at the gathered Origin Returning Realm practitioners with an expression that dismissed them entirely. His arrogant bearing drew frowns from every arriving expert; no one liked it.

The goat-bearded elder seemed about to retort when Yang Kai cut him off, asking, "Are you of Yingyue Hall?"

"Indeed!" The elder stroked his beard. "I am Ma Xinyuan, Lower Deacon of Yingyue Hall."

"Lower Deacon…" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and a mocking smile curved his lips. "Tell me, where is Elder Qian now?"

At the mention of Qian Tong, Ma Xinyuan's face shifted with evident apprehension. He was not the only one—most of the Origin Returning Realm people gathered here displayed the same wary look. Yang Kai's realization arrived then: these Origin Returning Realm cultivators were not allies of Qian Tong; within Yingyue Hall they were likely his rivals, which explained their reactions.

It seemed his earlier conjecture about Qian Tong and the upheaval within Yingyue Hall had not been far off.

"Elder Qian naturally remains stationed within Yingyue Hall. Boy, you destroyed our Juyuan Hall and assaulted people here. Don't think knowing Qian Tong will absolve you—if the Heavenly King himself came today, you still wouldn't escape," a middle-aged man on the right barked.

Yang Kai glanced at him and laughed lightly, "I won't leave until things are settled. I'm here today for two matters."

He pointed toward Yu Feng and the others as he spoke. "I'm here to take them away, and collect the supplies your hall owes."

The seven or eight Origin Returning Realm cultivators exchanged looks and caught the petty malice in one another's eyes. A few couldn't help but laugh, openly mocking Yang Kai's presumption.

Xie Quan laughed scornfully at Yang Kai's words. "Boy, your mouth is big—do you think you can just take them away? Did you ask for my permission?"

"Try to refuse and I'll beat you into agreement!" Yang Kai roared, pointed a finger, and a secret treasure resembling a refining furnace appeared out of thin air. The instant it manifested, the temperature within a hundred-zhang radius spiked, as if the air itself had become a furnace and the world plunged into fire.

A shrill cry like a bird came from the furnace, and a crimson Fire Bird over three zhang in length erupted forth. It spread its wings, and the fire-type Spiritual Qi of all Tianyun City seemed drawn toward its core.

No one had expected Yang Kai to be so audacious—outnumbered and outclassed, yet he struck first.

Once the Fire Bird absorbed the Spiritual Qi and swelled to over a dozen zhang, blotting out half the sky, the Origin Returning Realm experts finally recovered their wits. Xie Quan's eyes trembled with avarice as he gazed at the bird. "An Artifact Spirit! An Artifact Spirit!" he cried out.

No sooner had he spoken than the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird gaped and a basin-sized fireball shot forth toward Xie Quan.

The Artifact Spirit had awakened a month prior, a rare piece of fortunate news during Yang Kai's long seclusion. After it absorbed a trace of True Sun Fire, its spirit had grown and its strength soared.

At least now its flame-wielding power was three times what it had been when Yang Kai first tamed it.

Seeing that basin-sized fireball, which carried world-shattering destructive force, Xie Quan's complexion changed. He felt the threat of death within it and did not dare delay; he hastily released a defensive secret treasure and tried to ward it off while his body streaked away.

Boom…

A tremendous explosion rocked the place. Xie Quan's defensive treasure could not hold and was shattered; its spiritual radiance dimmed, leaving a huge crater scorched into the ground and its rim showing signs of melting.

"This Artifact Spirit is vicious—everyone, strike together!" Xie Quan shouted, having realized he was no match for it.

Those Origin Returning Realm cultivators immediately summoned their secret treasures to jointly confront the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird. Each of them had a gleam of mad delight in their eyes; even Yang Kai could no longer be casual about the matter.

They believed Yang Kai's reckless provocation must be backed by this Artifact Spirit; if they could subdue it, what was a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm to them?

Besides, capturing such an Artifact Spirit would greatly aid any of them—this treasure lay before them, and who would care further about Yang Kai?

Seeing the situation, Yang Kai sneered and waved his hands. Clusters of pitch-black fireballs blasted outward in all directions, striking those weaker than the Origin Returning Realm and tossing them about. Wherever the Demonic Flame passed, things burned; the quick ones fled, and the slow were consumed without a trace, not even bones remaining.

In an instant this area of Tianyun City became a sea of flames, the inferno so fierce it felt as if it could burn a hole through the sky.

"Go!" Yang Kai barked to Chang Qi and Hao An.

The two understood and immediately used their Star Shuttles to pull Yu Feng and the others aboard, rotating their Saint Yuan to carry them out of Tianyun City.

“Trying to run?” The goateed old man named Ma Xinyuan saw that Chang Qi and the others were fleeing from the battlefield and would not let them go so easily. With a flicker of light from the longsword in his hand, he slashed out one dazzling arc after another, sending sword rays sweeping toward Chang Qi and Hao An.

Yang Kai sneered and instantaneously summoned his Purple Shield. Channeling his Saint Yuan, he raised a yellowish sandstorm that wrapped around Chang Qi, Hao An and the others while urgently sending Chang Qi a wordless message.

Chang Qi's retreat faltered for a moment, then he surged forward again; together with Hao An they vanished without a trace, carrying Yu Feng and the disciples with them.

Only the burly man who had been whipping them remained, his wails echoing—yet even he had been reduced to something no longer recognizably human, a pitiful sight.

Yang Kai flicked his finger and spat out a blossom of Demonic Flame that struck the burly man's body, erasing him utterly from this world. The man belonged to the Xie Family, and Yang Kai spared him no mercy.
