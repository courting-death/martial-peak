## Chapter 2304 — The Auspicious Hour Arrives

Qiu Yu sighed, "Brother Yang, aren't you making things difficult for me?"

Yang Kai laughed, "Don't be so distant. This is just a small favor for you, it's not like I'm asking you to strip naked and run around here. Come on, will you do it or not?"

Qiu Yu's face twitched as he looked at him. "If I do it, then what? If I don't, then what?"

Yang Kai chuckled, patted Qiu Yu on the shoulder, and casually wiped the juice from his hand onto Qiu Yu's clothes. "If you do it, then we're good friends—everyone wins. If you don't... well, I might just have to go have a nice chat with the City Lord about his precious daughter's..."

"Enough!" Qiu Yu's face turned cold. He slapped Yang Kai's hand away and glared at him, gritting his teeth. "You're threatening me!"

"Am I?" Yang Kai blinked. "Brother Qiu, you've misunderstood. I'm just discussing things with you."

Qiu Yu said angrily, "I knew I shouldn't have come to you for news about Luo Bing, you despicable scoundrel!"

Yang Kai smiled with narrowed eyes. "Young man, don't get so worked up. Anger harms the body!"

Qiu Yu glared at him coldly for a long while before turning and leaving his seat, heading straight to a man who looked like a steward and whispering a few words.

The steward frowned at his words, looking troubled, and glanced several times toward the Thousand Leaves Sect and the others, shaking his head slightly.

But Qiu Yu said something else, and only then did the steward reluctantly nod in agreement, his face looking even more unpleasant.

A moment later, the steward walked up to the Thousand Leaves Sect and the others, cupped his fists, and said, "Honored guests, things are busy today and it seems there has been some oversight. Your seats are not here. Please follow me to another table. I hope you can forgive any neglect."

Du Xian, Ye Qinghan, and the others were all stunned, not knowing what the steward was up to.

Yang Kai, however, grinned and cupped his fists to the steward. "Thank you!"

As he spoke, he gave Ye Qinghan and the others a meaningful look.

Though everyone was still confused, they stood up and, under the steward's guidance, moved to an empty table at the very front, sitting down one after another as arranged.

Once everyone was settled, the steward left.

Only then did Ye Qinghan turn to Yang Kai and ask, "Young Master Yang, what is going on? What did you say to Qiu Yu?"

She knew that with the Thousand Leaves Sect's current strength and its relationship with Tianhe City, there was no way they would receive such treatment. The only explanation was the private conversation Yang Kai had just had with Qiu Yu.

After all, Qiu Yu had gone to the steward right after leaving, and immediately their seats were changed.

Du Xian and the others also looked at Yang Kai curiously, hoping for an answer.

Yang Kai smiled and said, "It's nothing. Brother Qiu and I hit it off at first sight and became fast friends. He felt the City Lord’s mansion was being too neglectful, so he took the initiative to suggest you all get a better table."

Clearly, no one believed him.

Ye Qinghan said, "As if anyone would believe that!"

Yang Kai said, "Brother Qiu is actually a pretty good guy."

This commotion drew the attention of many guests, who were secretly shocked. After all, everyone knew about the relationship between the Thousand Leaves Sect and Tianhe City. Now, seeing them suddenly moved to the most prominent table, this little anomaly made people suspicious, wondering if the two sides had reconciled. If that were the case, perhaps they should reconsider their own stance toward the Thousand Leaves Sect.

The atmosphere in the inner hall suddenly became strange.

The Thousand Leaves Sect and the others were all uneasy, constantly feeling the odd looks cast their way from all around, making them uncomfortable.

As time passed, the empty tables and chairs in the inner hall gradually filled up, and the lively atmosphere returned.

Suddenly, someone shouted, "The City Lord has arrived!"

At those words, the entire inner hall fell silent, and everyone turned to look in the same direction.

Over there, a man in a bright red robe stepped forward, his face beaming with joy as he cupped his fists to all sides.

"Greetings, City Lord!"

"It's been a while, City Lord. You look even more impressive than before—truly enviable!"

"Congratulations to the City Lord for finally marrying such a beautiful bride! Truly, you are a model for all of us!"

"On this joyous day, may the City Lord enjoy good health, prosperity in the Martial Dao, many descendants, and an everlasting family!"

...

From all directions, the guests offered their congratulations, each with a broad smile, doing their utmost to flatter.

The man in the red robe exchanged pleasantries with everyone, his smile never fading.

"Is that Luo Jin?" Yang Kai widened his eyes and quietly asked Ye Qinghan.

Ye Qinghan's face was calm as she nodded. "That's him!"

Yang Kai's mouth twitched. "If you hadn't told me, I would have thought that was Luo Jin's father..."

This was Yang Kai's first time seeing the City Lord of Tianhe City. He had thought that anyone who could take fifteen concubines must be skilled at maintaining his looks and full of vigor. Even with the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he shouldn't look too old.

Yet the man before him was already showing his age, his hair mottled white and thinning. Though his cultivation was impressive, his qi and blood were weak and hollow—clearly, he had entered the twilight of his years. In this lifetime, he had no hope of ever advancing to the Emperor Realm.

The bright red robe only made him look even older.

"What kind of girl would marry him? She must be blind!" Wuma shook his head repeatedly, feeling sorry for the woman marrying Luo Jin today.

"Shut up, or you'll bring disaster on yourself!" Du Xian glared fiercely at Wuma and whispered, "You know none of Luo Jin's concubines married him willingly."

Wuma snorted, "That's what happens when you bully men and women for too long. That's why he has no heirs—good and evil always get their due, and Heaven's justice comes around!"

"You keep talking!"

Wuma pouted, "Fine, fine, I'll stop."

The scene was lively and festive.

After a while, a voice called out, "The auspicious hour has arrived!"

Instantly, music and drums erupted all around, as if they would lift the roof off.

Luo Jin's face flushed red, and he straightened his clothes, smiling as he looked toward the door.

Everyone followed his gaze, all smiling, their eyes full of anticipation.

Music drifted in from outside, and with it, a wedding procession gradually came into view. At the front was a woman dressed as a matchmaker, swaying her ample waist, her smile so sweet it was cloying, walking beside a four-person bridal palanquin, showing off as much as she could.

Behind the palanquin, boys and girls followed, constantly scattering flower petals from their baskets.

Wherever the palanquin passed, petals paved the way and the air was filled with fragrance.

After the flower basket children came two more rows of boys and girls, each carrying a lantern. The lanterns bore auspicious phrases like "A Hundred Years of Harmony" and "A Happy Union."

After that came the rest of the wedding procession, all women, each weeping like pear blossoms in the rain—likely the bride's family.

The short distance of several dozen zhang took a full cup of tea's time to traverse before the palanquin finally reached the inner hall's entrance.

"Set down the palanquin!" someone called, and the bridal palanquin was gently lowered.

The matchmaker stepped forward, lifted the curtain, and reached inside. Immediately, a fair, delicate hand was placed in hers.

That single small hand made countless men's eyes light up.

The jade hand was flawless, skin like snow, seemingly breakable at a touch, stirring endless imagination. With such a hand, the woman must be stunning. Yet she was about to become Luo Jin's fifteenth concubine, making people sigh in regret, envy, and jealousy.

Next, a bright red embroidered shoe emerged from the palanquin, stepping onto the red carpet at the door. Only then did the dazzling figure of the bride come into view.

The bride wore a phoenix coronet and red veil, her wedding dress embroidered with golden phoenixes about to take flight. The beaded tassels of her coronet hid her face from view.

In that moment, countless people cursed inwardly.

The reason was that the phoenix coronet and red veil on the bride’s head seemed to block Divine Sense from probing—clearly a remarkable Secret Treasure!

All the martial artists who tried to secretly glimpse the bride’s face with their Divine Sense were blocked by an invisible barrier, unable to see anything inside.

Luo Jin seemed to know what everyone was thinking. He glanced around, silently warning them, then smiled in satisfaction.

Yang Kai couldn't help but curl his lips.

Just now, like the others, he had quietly released his Divine Sense to try to see the bride’s face, but was blocked by the Secret Treasure.

The Secret Treasure was powerful. If he forced his Divine Sense, he could break through and see her true face, but this was a concubine-taking ceremony. If he did that, he would draw attention and cause unnecessary trouble.

So he only tested it briefly before giving up and simply watched quietly.

At this moment, under the matchmaker’s guidance, the bride walked step by step toward the inner hall.

Though her face was hidden, the outline beneath her wedding dress showed a graceful figure—she must be a beautiful woman.

As Yang Kai watched, his brows suddenly furrowed; he seemed to sense something amiss, though he couldn't say what it was.

More importantly, the restless, uneasy feeling he had yesterday suddenly surged again, making him frown deeply.

He glanced at Ye Qinghan and the others, but saw that they noticed nothing.

Yet the scene seemed to stir some deep longing in Ye Qinghan. She gazed at the approaching bride, her beautiful eyes full of yearning, as if imagining herself one day wearing a phoenix coronet and red veil, marrying the one she loved most.

She stole a glance at Du Xian, her cheeks flushing slightly.

Before long, the group finally reached the inner hall. The matchmaker handed the silk ribbon to Luo Jin and said with a smile, "My lord, I leave the bride to you. Please treat her well from now on."

Luo Jin laughed heartily, "I won't let her suffer even a little."

The matchmaker said, "The bride is truly blessed. Why was my own life so bitter that I never met a man like you, my lord?"

Everyone burst into laughter, and the festive atmosphere reached its peak.
