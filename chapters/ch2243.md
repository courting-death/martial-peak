## Chapter 2243 — A Peculiar Space

“Let go, Granny. If you don’t, you’ll be stuck here for the rest of your life.” Wen Zishan gently persuaded, “We martial artists can only forge ahead when our hearts are unburdened. You’ve been trapped by the defeat of that battle all those years ago, blinded by hatred, intent on killing me. How could you ever ascend higher on the Martial Dao?”

“Brat, are you lecturing me?” Granny You glared angrily at Wen Zishan.

Wen Zishan simply shrugged. “I’m just speaking the truth. Besides, Granny, you surely understand these principles yourself—you just refuse to admit them.” He sighed softly, then continued, “Yang Kai and Xueting probably think the person before them is your true self, and that the peerless beauty who appeared in the Divine Roaming Mirror was just an illusion you conjured. But only you and I know… the appearance you showed in the Divine Roaming Mirror is your real face. The way you look now is just a disguise. Granny, you’re a woman too—why make things so hard on yourself?”

“Why say all this?” For some reason, Granny You’s tone softened considerably.

“I just want to say, Granny, your aptitude is not necessarily beneath mine. If you can untie the knot in your heart, perhaps one day you could also ascend to become a Great Emperor.”

As soon as these words fell, Granny You’s whole body trembled. She stared sharply at Wen Zishan and asked in a low voice, “Are you speaking from your heart?”

Wen Zishan smiled and said, “To be honest, those words aren’t mine.”

“Then who said them?”

“A shameless, carefree old fellow said it,” Wen Zishan replied, clearly reluctant to mention that person’s name.

Although he didn’t say the name, Granny You’s eyes flashed with a sharp light, as if she understood something.

“I can’t support Qingyang Shrine alone. Granny, are you willing to help me?” Wen Zishan looked sincerely at Granny You and asked.

Granny You looked at him for a while, then suddenly burst out laughing. She mocked, “I killed quite a few of your Qingyang Shrine’s elite disciples. Don’t you resent me at all?”

“Heaven’s way is constant, but fate is fickle. If they couldn’t cross that threshold, it means their cultivation wasn’t enough!” Wen Zishan replied solemnly.

Granny You’s expression shifted through a myriad of emotions before she fell silent. After a long pause, she suddenly shouted, “Get out! Get out!”

Wen Zishan smiled slightly and said, “Granny, think it over carefully.”

As his words fell, his entire figure gradually faded from this space, as if he had never appeared at all.

Only Granny You remained, her face cold, her expression constantly shifting.

…

Time passed swiftly. It had already been a month since Yang Kai followed Gao Xueting to the Purple Bamboo Peak cave dwelling.

During this time, he had been in seclusion, refining the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

At first, the Slave-Insect Bracelet showed no reaction. Yang Kai was patient, continuously using his own power to assault the restrictions on the bracelet. As time went on, this Imperial Treasure gradually began to change.

It slowly started to accept Yang Kai’s Divine Sense and Origin Qi.

This round of refinement was like stripping silk from a cocoon. Yang Kai spared no effort, knowing that only after clearing away every obstructing force would he have a chance to truly refine the Slave-Insect Bracelet, imprint his own Soul Brand within it, and make it his possession.

On this day, Yang Kai continued his usual actions.

But at a certain moment, a strange buzzing suddenly sounded. The air in the chamber trembled slightly, and at the same time, Yang Kai felt a burning sensation on his hand, as if the Slave-Insect Bracelet was being scorched by fire.

Seeing this, Yang Kai was not alarmed but delighted, knowing this was a sign of imminent success. He immediately poured all his strength into the bracelet, frantically channeling power into it.

The burning sensation on his hand grew more intense. The Slave-Insect Bracelet seemed to regain its spirit, bouncing in Yang Kai’s palm, trying to break free from his control.

But how could Yang Kai let it have its way? He held it firmly in his grasp.

Gradually, the burning sensation changed. Yang Kai’s palm felt as if it were being gnawed by ten thousand ants, an unbearable tingling that spread from his palm throughout his body, deep into his soul, making him extremely uncomfortable.

The tingling gradually transformed into pain—not only physical, but spiritual as well. It was as if his entire being, body and soul alike, were being sliced into countless pieces, shattered and ground to dust.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but let out a roar.

Even more surging Divine Sense and Origin Qi continued to pour in. Yang Kai gritted his teeth, enduring unimaginable torment.

After two days of this, Yang Kai suddenly felt his whole body lighten, and all abnormal sensations vanished in an instant.

At the same moment, the Slave-Insect Bracelet suddenly shone brightly. On the small bracelet’s surface, countless runes the size of rice grains danced like fireflies, making the whole chamber appear dazzlingly beautiful.

Those runes were extremely complex. Just one glance made them seem mysterious and wondrous, as if they possessed their own life, constantly flickering in and out of existence.

The once unremarkable Slave-Insect Bracelet gradually became suffused with Imperial Aura and brimming with Emperor Intent.

Seeing this, Yang Kai felt no joy at all. Instead, his expression grew grave.

Soon, all those complex runes converged back into the Slave-Insect Bracelet. In the next instant, Yang Kai heard a crisp crack in his mind, as if something had shattered. Immediately, his Divine Sense and Origin Qi surged in, flooding the Slave-Insect Bracelet without the slightest obstruction.

That sound in his soul was undoubtedly the final barrier breaking within the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

This meant the refining was more than halfway complete.

However... because the Slave-Insect Bracelet was not a newly forged Secret Treasure, it had a previous owner, so the greatest trial was yet to come.

As his Divine Sense poured in, Yang Kai quickly sensed a pure force inside the Slave-Insect Bracelet striking back at him.

This force was not vast, but it was incomparably pure.

This was the soul and life brand left behind by the Insect Emperor in the Slave-Insect Bracelet!

Only by completely shattering this brand could Yang Kai imprint his own mark.

The Insect Emperor’s true cultivation was at least the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Unfortunately, tens of thousands of years ago, he fought Yang Yan and was defeated and killed. Helpless, he could only entrust his soul to the Void Mind Crystal, and finally relied on possession to be reborn.

But he never regained his former might.

After so many millennia, the brand in the Slave-Insect Bracelet had long since weakened to a pitiful state.

If not for this, Yang Kai would never have had a chance to refine the Slave-Insect Bracelet, unless he asked Wen Zishan to help expel the brand.

Now, though this brand was pure, its strength only barely reached the level of the Emperor Realm, about equal to Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

The brand struck back, trying to stop Yang Kai’s next move. Naturally, Yang Kai would not retreat. He met it head-on, mobilizing his Divine Sense.

“Boom...”

A sound rang out. Yang Kai’s body swayed slightly, and he felt dizzy.

This was a clash of souls, with no tricks—only the tenacity and strength of Divine Sense mattered.

After this collision, neither Yang Kai nor the original brand gained the upper hand; they were evenly matched.

Catching his breath, Yang Kai once again mobilized his Divine Sense, blasting into the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

Another sound rang out. Blood trickled from Yang Kai’s nose and mouth, and his face turned a bit pale.

But after this clash, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense clearly gained the upper hand. The Insect Emperor’s brand had been weakened by more than half.

Yang Kai didn’t stop. Seizing the momentum, he mobilized his Divine Sense for a third time.

Boom...

On the Slave-Insect Bracelet, a flash of light appeared, as if something had been broken open.

Wherever Yang Kai’s Divine Sense passed, it moved unhindered, with no more obstacles.

At this point, the Insect Emperor’s brand was finally destroyed.

Yang Kai poured his Divine Sense into it, enduring his physical discomfort, and while the iron was hot, imprinted his own Soul Brand inside the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

After finishing, he grinned, collapsed to the ground, and didn’t want to move at all.

Now, the Slave-Insect Bracelet could be considered his Imperial Treasure. However, what marvelous uses it might have would have to be tested and developed in the future.

The silent struggle had consumed much of Yang Kai’s spirit and strength. Fortunately, he had the Warm Spirit Lotus; otherwise, he would never have dared to erase the Insect Emperor’s brand in such a direct and violent way.

But with the nourishment of the Warm Spirit Lotus, he wasn’t worried about any fundamental damage to his soul. He could afford to be reckless.

After resting for half a day and feeling somewhat better, Yang Kai sat up again and carefully examined the Slave-Insect Bracelet before his eyes.

After refining it, the Slave-Insect Bracelet hadn’t changed much, except now it responded to his will.

He stirred his Divine Sense, pouring it into the Slave-Insect Bracelet, wanting to see what mysteries this Secret Treasure held and how to use it to restrain the Soul-Devouring Worms.

What happened next surprised him.

As soon as his Divine Sense entered the Slave-Insect Bracelet, he discovered a peculiar space inside the bracelet.

This space was not like the interior of the Xuan Realm Pearl, which people could freely enter and exit.

Instead, it was somewhat similar to the space inside a Spatial Ring, though there were subtle differences.

Yang Kai could sense that within this space, some strange energy was surging. This energy was neither beneficial nor harmful to the soul; its purpose was unknown.

Yang Kai’s gaze was quickly drawn to the many wine jars of various sizes and shapes within the space.

Some of these wine jars were taller than a person, some only a foot high, all neatly arranged to one side. He had no idea what was inside them.

Curious, Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense over them to inspect.

But soon, his expression changed dramatically. His Divine Sense recoiled in shock, hastily retreating from the wine jars.

He sensed that many of the wine jars contained something, with only a few being empty. He didn’t know what those things were, but he heard strange noises from within—some squirming, some buzzing, and some completely silent.

Yet every item sealed in the wine jars gave Yang Kai an extremely dangerous feeling.

Even as the owner of the Slave-Insect Bracelet, he didn’t dare open the wine jars lightly to investigate their contents.

As he wavered, he suddenly noticed that words were appearing on the surface of each wine jar. He quickly focused his gaze to look more closely.
