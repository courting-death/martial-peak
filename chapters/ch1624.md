## Chapter 1624 — Star Power Augmentation

Watching Yang Kai swagger away once more from a position not far from him, Luo Hai suddenly halted mid-stride; his face was unnervingly calm, as if the calm before a raging tempest.

He released his Divine Sense, locked onto the spot where Yang Kai had appeared, his deep gaze piercing the void as he drew a long breath and intoned in measured voice: “I am the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star; heed my command — transmit me star power!”

No sooner had the words fallen than Cuiwei Star trembled countless millions of li away; an inconceivable pillar of energy shot forth from that star, traversing hundreds of millions of li in an instant and smote Luo Hai.

Luo Hai’s already terrifying aura surged wildly, reaching the degree of the Void King Realm’s Third Stage!

At the same time, inside the city lord’s main hall, Elder Jiu and the other Void King Realm experts were all aghast, rising to their feet.

“Star power augmentation!” Matron Lei’s withered body trembled, and her seemingly cloudy eyes flared with astonishing light.

“It’s actually star power augmentation! Lord Luo Hai has actually drawn upon the Stellar Origin of Cuiwei Star!”

“As Star Lord, no matter where one stands, so long as one remains within this Star Domain, one may call upon the Stellar Origin — what danger has Lord Luo Hai run into to force him to do this?”

“Who is he trying to fight to the death?”

Seven or eight Void King Realm figures looked around bewildered; none of them knew what had befallen Luo Hai that would compel him to draw on the Stellar Origin.

It should be understood that even for a Star Lord, using the Stellar Origin is not a trivial matter.

The Star Lord and his Cultivation Star are bound — their fortunes rise and fall together; once a portion of Stellar Origin is siphoned off, it cannot be restored in a short time. This is worse than the Star Lord himself being injured. Whether this battle is won or lost, Cuiwei Star’s loss cannot be mended within a thousand years, unless Luo Hai can advance one Stage within that thousand years and reach the exalted stature of the Third Stage.

Were Luo Hai not forced, he would never do such a thing, but how many people in this world could truly coerce Luo Hai to such extremes?

Could it be that he provoked some top expert who shuns the world?

Elder Jiu and the others turned pale as death!

Although they were indeed Void King Realm cultivators, they were only at the First Stage; the Second Stage was unattainable for them, let alone the ethereal Third Stage.

Everyone sensed imminent disaster.

As Luo Hai siphoned that thread of Stellar Origin from Cuiwei Star, the Spiritual Qi of the entire star seemed to wane by a hair.

Such a subtle change was not obvious at once, but it truly had weakened.

This was the direct consequence of drawing upon the Stellar Origin!

Legends tell of ancient times when Star Lords fought and invoked Stellar Origin; both were left crippled. The Cultivation Stars they possessed went from extreme abundance to utter barrenness, and to this day have not recovered their Yuan Qi.

Within the Star Domain, Luo Hai’s aura, bolstered by star power, grew frenzied as he fixed his sight on the place where Yang Kai stood; he opened his mouth and expelled a white breath that shot forth like a sword-light, cleaving the distant void.

Ten thousand li away, Yang Kai felt a chill run down his spine and the hairs on his arms stand up — a keen sense of mortal danger spread through his chest.

Though he didn’t know exactly what had happened to Luo Hai, he could tell the man was truly enraged. Not daring to be careless, he reached forward and tore open the space ahead.

His once-unfailing space-rending now felt wrong; Yang Kai’s location seemed shackled by something, and no matter how he tried the rifts could not expand. Each tear in the space ahead only reached the length of a single chi and would not widen.

Chi—chi—chi—

A harsh sound rang out all around; before the white sword-light even arrived, the sheer killing intent chilled Yang Kai as if he stood atop a ten thousand zhang snow mountain, a furious wind like knives gouging at his skin.

Bad! Yang Kai’s face changed drastically; seeing the white sword-light closing in, he dared not remain and frantically forced his Saint Yuan, slinging himself aside.

He had barely moved when the white sword-light struck where he had been.

The void seemed split in two — a vast spatial rift had appeared in that region!

Luo Hai did not understand space power, but this blow had already affected the stability of the space.

The aftershock of the attack splashed everywhere; clanging sounds rang from Yang Kai’s body like metal on metal.

In an instant, his garments were stained gold by Golden Blood, and hundreds of tiny holes appeared across Yang Kai’s solid body! From those holes, a savage qi crawled in, eager to tear at his meridians and flesh.

If the white sword-light itself had struck him directly, Yang Kai would have been pulverized; even the residual force alone was terrifyingly strong.

He paled, unable to check his wounds, and desperately rallied his Saint Yuan to suppress the invading qi; once more he employed space power and tore open a spatial rift.

No sooner had he stepped away than Luo Hai arrived right on his heels!

“Let’s see how long you can run!” Luo Hai’s face was as cold as still water; he had not expected his star-augmented strike to fail to fell Yang Kai, and his mood soured further as he surged forward in pursuit.

One chased and one fled; unlike before, Yang Kai was now giving everything he had.

Luo Hai’s inexplicable surge in strength made Yang Kai suspect a connection to that beam of light he had seen — perhaps the fabled star power augmentation!

The old bastard would go so far to deal with him — Yang Kai cursed silently; he understood the consequences of drawing on the Stellar Origin.

After yet another narrow escape, Yang Kai’s face darkened.

A Luo Hai bolstered by star power was a completely different opponent; Yang Kai reckoned that if his Divine Sense were exhausted again, he would truly be unable to resist.

The Xuan Realm Pearl had been exposed once; Luo Hai would not be so easily deceived again. Using the Xuan Realm Pearl to hide oneself in this empty Star Domain was no longer an option.

He had to head for a Cultivation Star instead!

On a Cultivation Star countless sentient beings lived; even as Star Lord, Luo Hai could not be wantonly destructive there. Only by reaching the nearest Cultivation Star would Yang Kai have a chance to use the Xuan Realm Pearl to conceal himself anew.

Yang Kai’s eyes grew resolute; sinking his mind, he conjured a Spirit Body within his Sea of Consciousness.

He looked up to the heavens and used the vast Star Chart to determine his position, searching for the closest Cultivation Star.

With this Star Chart he could view a miniature Star Domain; finding a Cultivation Star was not difficult.

After a moment his eyes brightened; his Spirit Body slipped from the Sea of Consciousness, adjusted course, and continued its escape.

Ahead a starry-sky storm loomed, a tempest that could dim the sun itself, but Yang Kai strode into it unfazed; outside his body multicolored light bloomed as the Undying Five Elements Sword qi shielded him.

Naturally Luo Hai was not afraid of the storm either; he spat that white sword-breath and leisurely strode into the gale.

Wherever he passed, the starry sky storms seemed to startle and part on their own, opening a path before him.

In barely a quarter of an hour, Luo Hai calmly emerged from the starry storm.

But when he scanned the scene, where was Yang Kai’s trace?

The brat had vanished again at some unknown moment, leaving only a faint aura of having used space power in the nearby void.

“Troublesome!” Luo Hai’s mood worsened; he turned his head and looked toward a huge, brilliantly colored Cultivation Star tens of thousands of li to his left. Narrowing his eyes he said, “If you think to hide there, fine — I’ll see how long you can dodge me!”

He soon guessed Yang Kai’s intent and determined the brat must have concealed himself on that brilliantly colored Cultivation Star.

For once hidden there, it would be no easy matter to find him.

A Cultivation Star differs from a Dead Star — a Dead Star can be destroyed at will with no blame, but if one damages a Cultivation Star, the entire Star Domain would come after you; even if Luo Hai fled back to Cuiwei Star, he would be doomed.

With the restriction on destroying a Cultivation Star, finding someone who deliberately hid there was like seeking a needle in an ocean; even Luo Hai was powerless — this was not his Cuiwei Star, and he could not use Stellar Origin to probe all.

“This must be Chi Lan Star.” Luo Hai soon arrived ten thousand li above that Cultivation Star and swept his gaze; recognizing he had been here before, he snorted, “Fine. I’ll go see that old bastard Chi Huo — haven’t seen him in over a thousand years. Wonder if the old dog has advanced, whether he’s broken through to the Second Stage!”

Saying that, he strolled off in a given direction.

In a stretch of desolate mountains, a river cut the range from south to north; beneath the silt of a certain brook, the Xuan Realm Pearl lay quietly.

The mountain was called Cang Mountain; the river dubbed Cang River — few humans ever trod there.

Yang Kai slipped through the starry-sky storm and eluded Luo Hai’s Divine Sense pursuit; upon first reaching this Cultivation Star he promptly hid the Xuan Realm Pearl in a concealed spot and then crawled into it himself.

He trusted that Luo Hai would not act wantonly on this Cultivation Star, so for now he was safe.

Appearing in the loft of the Xuan Realm Pearl, Xia Ningshang’s tears fell patter by patter; Yang Kai’s condition this time was far worse than the last.

Last time, he had merely exhausted his Divine Sense and felt some fatigue. But this time, his whole body was covered in wounds — fine as pinholes, invisible to the naked eye — yet Xia Ningshang keenly sensed a subtle, sinister energy within them, quietly eroding Yang Kai’s body.

Yang Kai’s complexion was as pale as paper.

“Don’t worry, I’ll recover after a period of seclusion; I might need some time,” Yang Kai told Xia Ningshang, then sat cross-legged and began to purge the invasive qi from his body.

Xia Ningshang silently stepped out of the loft, looked back with worry, and stood guard outside without a word.

But soon she seemed to recall something, fetched a great quantity of herbs and inner cores from demonic beasts, sat cross-legged with an impassive expression, and began to refine pills!

She felt herself so helpless; she hated that she could not assist Yang Kai.

On Tongxuan Continent she had no idea of danger — there she could single-handedly sweep the entire continent if she chose.

But ever since Yang Kai had brought her out, she had truly seen the brilliance and peril of the Star Domain.

She truly understood her own weakness.

If she were strong enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with her Junior Brother, perhaps he would not be wounded!

Xia Ningshang began refining pills frantically!
