## Chapter 1890 — Bargaining

When Chi Yue spoke those words, not only did Yang Kai start and show a strange expression, but Xue Jiao and Qian Yan were also utterly astonished as they turned to look toward Half Moon Mountain.

No one had expected Chi Yue to say something like that.

After a long moment, Yang Kai furrowed his brow and asked, "Senior, what do you mean by that?"

"Let them go." Chi Yue's voice was utterly indifferent, devoid of hatred or anger, as if speaking of something ordinary. "Although Xue Jiao and Qian Yan offended me, they are after all Yao Lords. If they die here, the yao's strength will surely decline, which would be harmful to Di Chen Star."

Hearing her say that, Xue Jiao and Qian Yan unexpectedly showed expressions of exhilaration, mixed with some shame.

Compared with Chi Yue's broad-minded concern for the yao and Di Chen, they felt petty and small-minded.

“Senior, think this through. If you don’t finish the snake, it’ll climb right back up the stick. And letting a tiger walk free only invites trouble later. Are you sure you want to leave them alive?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

Xue Jiao and Qian Yan instantly glared at Yang Kai, thinking: Chi Yue was willing to spare them, so what business did an outsider like him have to interfere!

Chi Yue said, "Do I need you to teach me such reasoning? After suffering this lesson, they'll at least need to seclude for more than ten years to recover. Ten years from now... hehe, if I send them east, do you think they'll dare go west?"

Xue Jiao and Qian Yan exchanged a look, their faces extremely ugly.

Although unwilling, they both knew Chi Yue's words were not wrong. Though she had struck only once just now, the two Yao Lords vaguely felt that Chi Yue's realm had already approached that of a Yao King; given some time, she would certainly be able to become the Yao King of Di Chen Star.

When that time came, Xue Jiao and Qian Yan truly would not dare resist; they could only submit to Chi Yue.

Among the yao, strength always ruled; there was little room for reason.

With that thought, Xue Jiao and Qian Yan both collapsed like deflated skins, their fighting spirit gone, and they clasped their fists weakly, saying, "If we can escape this calamity today, in future we will only obey Her Highness the Yao King!"

They even changed how they addressed Chi Yue.

"Your attitudes change fast," Yang Kai said, staring at them in surprise.

Xue Jiao and Qian Yan flushed and glared at Yang Kai.

"Since you have such resolve, I'll spare your lives today!" Chi Yue snorted coldly.

"Thank you, Your Highness!" Xue Jiao and Qian Yan exclaimed with joy, thanking her in turn.

Yang Kai grinned, "Don't be so happy—Chi Yue said she'd spare you, but I didn't. Your lives are still in my hands."

"You brat, what do you want?" Qian Yan snapped angrily, shouting.

Xue Jiao's face was also ashen. His Inner Core was still being held by Yang Kai, so despite his displeasure he dared not say much.

“I’m thinking… best to pull the weeds out by the root.” Yang Kai’s grin turned wicked.

Qian Yan and Xue Jiao both took several steps back, eyes wary as they watched Yang Kai.

“Sigh…” Chi Yue breathed out. “Boy, stop scaring them. Just say it—what terms will make you let them go? If you truly meant to wipe them out, you wouldn’t be standing here wasting time.”

“Senior, you misunderstand me—I really do mean to wipe them out. I’m not fishing for any benefit. Their sons died by my hand; a grudge like that isn’t something that simply fades.”

"They have so many offspring; losing two is nothing," Chi Yue sneered.

Qian Yan and Xue Jiao, though ugly-faced, both nodded vigorously.

"Is that so..." Yang Kai rubbed his chin and after thinking a moment said, "If they swear not to seek revenge on me in the future, I can let them go."

Qian Yan and Xue Jiao looked at each other and, not daring to be careless, swore solemnly by the yao ancestors that they would never trouble Yang Kai again.

Chi Yue said, "Though the yao are brutal and warlike, oaths sworn in the name of the yao ancestors are extremely credible; no yao would dare break such a vow, or they would face the whole yao race's pursuit!"

"Very well, then go." Yang Kai grinned and waved at Xue Jiao and Qian Yan.

Xue Jiao looked at Yang Kai imploringly, "My Inner Core!"

"I'll keep the Inner Core," Yang Kai said with a chuckle.

"Then just kill me," Xue Jiao snapped angrily.

Chi Yue said, "Boy, stop joking and return the Inner Core to him."

Yang Kai looked speechless, "Senior, I've fought long and hard—surely I can't get nothing for it? I paid a price too."

"You little bastard! So that's what you were waiting for!" Chi Yue suddenly seemed to understand and cursed through gritted teeth.

"Senior, I don't understand what you mean," Yang Kai looked innocent.

"Speak! Exactly what favor do you want?"

"I only want that Inner Core!" Yang Kai said with a resolute expression.

"Your Highness the Yao King, please act on my behalf." Xue Jiao looked pitifully at Half Moon Mountain, almost in tears.

He had cultivated for thousands of years and had finally achieved his current attainments; if his Inner Core were taken by Yang Kai, his cultivation would certainly fall below the Origin Returning Realm, and he would have no chance to improve again.

For him, that would be worse than death.

So he could only beg Chi Yue for help.

"Enough!" Chi Yue snapped angrily. "Boy, return the Inner Core to him and I can give you three Inner Cores at the First Stage of the Void King Realm."

"How about five?" Yang Kai bargained.

"It seems you don't want to see Qingluo again in future..." Chi Yue's words were light, but her tone made it plain how much she was grinding her teeth.

"Uh... since Senior has spoken, fine." Yang Kai wore a face as if he had taken a huge loss and tossed the Inner Core in his hand to Xue Jiao.

Xue Jiao fumbled to catch it, hurriedly inspecting it from all angles. Only after confirming it was intact did he swallow it in one gulp, exhaling in clear relief.

"Get out of here. If there's a next time, I will cut you down without mercy!" Chi Yue declared sharply.

Qian Yan and Xue Jiao shivered all over and dared not say anything; they clasped their fists and took their leave.

After they had gone, Chi Yue snorted, "You little brat dare extort me—just you wait."

Yang Kai chuckled.

"Come in now."

As soon as Chi Yue finished speaking, a rift opened in the barrier around Half Moon Mountain, leading straight inside.

Two warships descended through the clouds.

A moment later, Yang Kai and the two warships entered Half Moon Mountain together and docked in a plaza.

Ba He, Yu Xiong, Shen Tu and the others came out and all stared at Yang Kai as if he were a monster.

Yu Xiong, however, gave Yang Kai a thumbs-up, his face full of admiration.

They had watched the intense battle between Yang Kai and the two lords from above the clouds and seen everything clearly.

Two opponents, both at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, fighting one against two—he not only held the advantage but ultimately controlled their lives and deaths. It was simply inconceivable.

Even a Third Stage Void King expert would likely manage no more than this.

Yet Yang Kai was only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. A few years ago he had still been in the Origin Returning Realm. In other words, he had not been high in realm for long, yet he already possessed such battle strength. Once his realm stabilized, could he not rival Third Stage?

Shen Tu and the others were equally shocked. Although Yang Kai had once confronted experts like Kuang Shizong in Purple Star City, those encounters had not been full-on fights; Yang Kai had relied on massive support and the threat of destroying Purple Star to force Kuang Shizong's compromise.

This time's direct clash was completely different.

"By order of the Lord, she is indisposed and cannot receive visitors today; please remain here for a few days until her Yuan Qi has stabilized," Ba He stepped forward and told Yang Kai.

"No problem." Yang Kai nodded.

He also knew that Chi Yue had been affected by today's events even in seclusion; the effect should not be severe, but she would need time to recover.

So he did not worry much.

Under arrangements by Ba He and the others, members of the Hengluo Commerce Guild and Yang Kai settled inside Half Moon Mountain.

There were no special accommodations; after moving in no one paid them any attention.

Yang Kai found his lodging was not far from Shan Qingluo's residence and knew Chi Yue had arranged this deliberately.

At night, when all was silent, Yang Kai sat cross-legged in his room and, with his Divine Sense drifting, cautiously explored toward Shan Qingluo's loft.

Despite the great commotion earlier, Shan Qingluo had not been disturbed; she was clearly in a crucial state of seclusion, shielding herself from all outside perception.

There were several layers of powerful sealing formations outside Shan Qingluo's loft.

But before Yang Kai's Divine Sense those seals posed no problem; with ease he broke through.

On the second floor of that loft, Yang Kai saw Shan Qingluo.

This former Enchantress Queen was more alluring than before; already able to charm the world, with her cultivation rising and the fusion of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider's origin power, her entire being exuded astonishing allure.

Even a man of firm mind like Yang Kai couldn't help being slightly stunned at the sight of her.

She seemed to have become a vast whirlpool, her unimaginable charm swallowing any man's gaze or Divine Sense, leaving him helpless.

At that moment Shan Qingluo sat cross-legged, her fair arms bare in the air as her delicate hands formed a mysterious hand-seal.

Yang Kai's attention involuntarily lingered on those fair arms for a while...

Beneath Shan Qingluo lay a magical array which was operating, and before her were several Domain Stones; as the array ran, energy was drawn from the stones and poured into her.

Around Shan Qingluo, the embryonic form of a Domain Field had already begun to rise, faint domain power constantly emerging.

For those ascending from the Origin Returning Realm to the Void King Realm, the hardest part was not the accumulation of Saint Yuan but the comprehension of Domain.

Only by grasping its mystery could a martial artist break through that barrier and reach a new realm.

Before that, a martial artist in the Origin Returning Realm needed to refine their own Shi to a consummate state, slowly transforming it into a Domain.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai's face showed delight.

Shan Qingluo, having absorbed the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider's Origin power, evidently possessed a talent quite different from before; her Shi had long since matured and she had already found the threshold of Domain—given sufficient time and the right opportunity, she could break through to the Void King Realm.
