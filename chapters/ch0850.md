## Chapter 850 — Showing Off Before the Masters?

Four full hours later, the pill furnace in front of Du Wan suddenly began to hum and shake, as if a living thing had been trapped inside and was about to burst free.

Du Wan's expression turned extremely grave. He performed the final spirit formulas, poured True Yuan into the furnace, and carried out the last stage of refinement.

After a moment, he gave the furnace a gentle tap and a snow-white pill the size of a fingernail shot out with a crisp sound.

Quick as lightning, Du Wan snatched a fine jade vial, caught the pill, and sealed the mouth.

A rich fragrance of medicinal herbs filled the pill workshop.

Du Wan lightly sampled the Saint Pill he had just refined, smiled, and nodded with clear satisfaction.

Mi Na and Ye Xiong both felt a thrill at the sight.

The five Saint-Grade Lower-Level alchemists began refining together; Elder Du was the first to succeed, showing he was indeed a step ahead in alchemical skill compared to the others.

Yet no one spoke; they watched in silence, waiting for the other four to finish.

Right after Du Wan came Kong Ruoyu; not long after—no more than the time a stick of incense burns—the Lower-Level Saint-Grade Soul-Safeguard Pill had been completed and she stored it in a jade vial.

Half an hour later, Chang Bao, He Feng, and Hong Fang finished one after another.

Five Saint Pills were produced, and the workshop swelled with dense medicinal fragrance that made the breath calm and pleasant.

All five masters looked somewhat exhausted, especially the rotund Chang Bao; he had been sweating profusely during refinement, and now his flesh trembled as he awkwardly dabbed his brow.

They exchanged knowing looks and smiled, but didn’t rush to compare their pills; instead, they took restorative pills, sat cross-legged, and closed their eyes to recuperate.

It looked like they intended to rest for a while.

Refining Saint Pills was a tremendous drain on both energy and spirit for them.

Only now did Mi Na and Ye Xiong finally breathe deeply, savoring what they'd witnessed. They felt they had learned a great deal and wished they could immediately put it into practice.

"Yang Kai, who do you think among these five masters made the best pill?" Mi Na asked, staring ahead without blinking.

No answer came.

She turned to Yang Kai and found him wearing a contemplative expression, his spirit already roaming beyond—he hadn’t heard her question at all.

"Looks like he benefited a lot too," Ye Xiong chuckled. "Don’t disturb him—he’s likely comprehending more than the rest of us."

Yang Kai’s state clearly indicated a deep insight; he would not be in such a condition without substantial gain.

Ye Xiong couldn't help but feel a little envious.

"Oh." Mi Na nodded quickly and kept her breathing careful and quiet, waiting for the masters to recover.

After a short while, just as Mi Na was still savoring the scene, she noticed Yang Kai move out of the corner of her eye.

Curious, she glanced over and gave a small, surprised sound.

Yang Kai had taken out his little pill furnace and set several Saint-Grade heaven-and-earth treasures before him; he then focused and covered the furnace, drawing a spirit formation within.

At that moment the five recovering masters finally came fully to themselves. Hong Fang laughed aloud: "The Saint Pills are done. Let our judges taste them and see whose pill is superior."

"Fine." Chang Bao snickered. "I hope your alchemy hasn’t regressed."

"You should worry about yourself," Du Wan said with an amused shake of his head. "These years you seem to have been indulging your appetite."

Chang Bao scoffed, "But my alchemy hasn’t fallen behind."

They spoke and rose, stepping toward where Yang Kai and the others were seated.

When they drew near and saw Yang Kai’s actions, all of them froze.

"Eh, kid… you’re going to show off your axe at Lu Ban’s gate?" He Feng laughed, teasing but without malice.

Du Wan frowned, sensing something odd. Kong Ruoyu, the only female among the masters, also grew serious and raised a hand to signal everyone to stop and not get closer.

Mi Na and Ye Xiong quietly slipped away from Yang Kai’s side and came to stand before the five.

"Elder Du, Yang Kai suddenly started refining and seems to have gained a lot—he wants to test it," Mi Na said softly.

Elder Du wore a faint smile, his eyes brimming with approval. “Don’t disturb him; he should be in the midst of enlightenment.”

"Enlightenment?" Mi Na frowned. "Is there such a thing in alchemy?"

"Of course. Do you think enlightenment belongs only to martial paths?" Du Wan explained quietly. "Alchemy has it too. When it happens, nothing around him draws his attention; his world narrows to his insight, the furnace, and the medicinal materials… It’s interesting—whether he can break through the barrier before him is the question."

"I had such an experience decades ago," Kong Ruoyu recalled. "As Brother Du said, I saw nothing but my furnace and the ingredients, thinking only of successfully refining that one pill… Unfortunately, no matter how I tried later, I couldn’t reach that state again. Like enlightenment in martial practice, it's rare and cannot be forced."

"So what happened? Did your pill succeed?" Mi Na pressed, curiosity shining.

Kong Ruoyu smiled and nodded. "Of course it succeeded, and the quality was excellent—its medicinal effect barely wasted a trace. It was my proudest creation; I still keep it to this day."

"That’s wonderful," Mi Na said, eyes glowing with admiration.

"But don’t you think his choice of materials is problematic…" He Feng frowned. "Why are all his materials Saint-Grade? Can he refine with those?"

On hearing this, everyone examined Yang Kai’s materials closely and indeed found them all to be Saint-Grade.

"He’s trying to refine a Saint Pill?" Chang Bao exclaimed.

Du Wan’s eyes brightened and he chuckled lowly. "Perhaps he truly can produce a Saint Pill!"

"Du Wan, don’t joke!" He Feng rolled his eyes. "Refining a Saint Pill is no simple matter. Even if his aptitude is not bad and he’s impressive, and maybe in the future he’ll surpass us, he’s still too young to refine a Saint Pill now."

"Young people have vigorous Qi and blood; they act on impulse and need setbacks to humble them. What a pity about his enlightenment—if he’d chosen Spirit-Grade materials the gain would have been greater," Hong Fang said regretfully.

Chang Bao and Kong Ruoyu also sighed and nodded, agreeing that Yang Kai attempting a Saint Pill now was overambitious.

Du Wan smiled wryly and said nothing further.

Though he hoped Yang Kai would succeed, he still thought the youth was overreaching.

Successfully refining a Saint Pill would mark someone as a Saint-Grade alchemist—a rarity across the continent, usually elderly veterans steeped in decades of practice.

Yang Kai was simply too young.

"Let’s observe and later point out his shortcomings—that will help his growth," Kong Ruoyu said softly.

The group nodded and watched in silence.

Yang Kai’s movements weren’t as flowing as the masters’, but they were steady and meticulous, with every step timed to perfection.

The masters clicked their tongues in admiration as they watched.

Because Yang Kai’s fundamentals were so solid, even with their strict, critical eyes they could find no flaw during the condensation of the medicinal liquid.

Moreover, the True Yuan emanating from him was pure and powerful. Some spirit formation had clearly been inscribed within the furnace beforehand; once the herbs were added, the liquid condensed without any waste.

Those condensed liquids were wrapped in the pure True Yuan, floating beside the furnace, to be used later.

The scene made the masters nod slightly, their faces showing approval.

In the space of two incense sticks the herbs had been condensed into liquid—such speed left the masters dumbfounded.

Even if they had done the work themselves, it wouldn’t have been better; but it would have taken them longer.

This meant Yang Kai’s True Yuan was purer than theirs, and the spirit formation he chose was superior.

Once the liquid had condensed, Yang Kai casually waved his hand and the furnace erupted in a burst of light as if the inscribed spirit formation had been destroyed.

Seeing this, Chang Bao couldn’t help whispering, "This kid is reckless—if the formation is destroyed like that, how will he have time to inscribe another?"

The medicinal liquid had been condensed, and though wrapped by True Yuan its potency would evaporate—if it wasn’t quickly returned to the furnace for refining, the effect would be wasted.

When they refined, they normally rebuilt formations on previous foundations so as to save time and preserve potency; they wouldn’t completely destroy the original formation.

Yet Yang Kai had directly shattered the original formation.

Concern crossed everyone’s faces; they imagined him producing an inferior pill and lamented the loss of the precious Saint-Grade materials.

No sooner had Chang Bao’s voice fallen than the furnace, which had just flashed, flickered again with faint light. The masters, with discerning sight, saw faint lines stir and flow inside the furnace.

"So fast?" He Feng gaped, disbelief written on his face. "Impossible…"

The light clearly heralded the spirit formation taking shape once more.

A moment ago he had destroyed one formation and now another had been inscribed—such astonishing speed exceeded the masters’ understanding.
