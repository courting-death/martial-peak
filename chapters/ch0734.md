## Chapter 734 — Ice-Body Locking the Heart

Outside the ice mountain, the Ice Sect's leader Qing Ya appeared in a strange manner; she not only showed no displeasure or hostility toward Yang Kai, she was positively affable, which made Yang Kai feel embarrassed to keep making a scene.

He had already resolved to tear ties with the Ice Sect, make a proper commotion here, and take Su Yan away.

Yet Qing Ya's manner left him with no leverage to act; she greeted him with a smiling face, and if he behaved as he had earlier, it would only make him seem unreasonable.

"You came looking for Su Yan, didn't you? Meng Wuya mentioned this before," Qing Ya asked softly.

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"To be frank, Su Yan suffered a bit of an accident," Qing Ya said.

Yang Kai's expression instantly chilled; Qing Ya hurriedly added, "But don't worry, she isn't in danger of dying — she's simply frozen herself."

"Frozen herself?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Her current condition was her own choice. Of course, our Ice Sect bears some responsibility. Come with me; you'll understand when you see her. A few words won't make it clear." Qing Ya beckoned Yang Kai over.

"Sect Leader…" Qian Yue called out at once, as if to stop her, but Qing Ya shot her a look and she quickly clamped her mouth shut, awkwardly silent.

"By the way, before that, could you first withdraw those little bugs from the Sea of Consciousness of our Ice Sect disciples? Since those bugs were released by you, you ought to have a way to take them back, right?" Qing Ya smiled pleasantly at Yang Kai.

"Sorry, until I confirm my Senior Sister's condition, I won't withdraw those alien worms," Yang Kai slowly shook his head. He only had this one trump card now; using the lives of over two hundred Ice Sect disciples as a threat was what kept the Ice Sect from acting rashly. Although Qing Ya seemed trustworthy, one must never be without caution; if he recalled the Soul Devouring Worms and they suddenly tried to kill him, Yang Kai wouldn't have the skill to survive under the hands of someone at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

"You're awfully careful," Qing Ya sighed helplessly. "In that case, our Ice Sect disciples won't come to harm, will they?"

"I said it: within half an hour time, they will not be in danger," Yang Kai said indifferently.

"Very well, then follow me. Qian Yue, you come too. Qian Hao, you and the others stay outside and tend to those disciples."

"Yes." All of them replied in unison, respectful in tone. Qian Hao even shot Yang Kai a cold glare and threatened, "Kid, don't try any tricks, or you'll regret it."

Yang Kai couldn't be bothered to answer him.

With Qing Ya flying ahead, they stopped before the ice mountain where Yang Kai had earlier sensed Su Yan's aura. Qing Ya waved her jade hand and, at the mountain's midsection, an eerie gate formed.

The gate was carved from ice crystal; mysterious energies flowed across it and faint formation patterns were visible — clearly capable of blocking Divine Sense detection.

Entering the mountain, a bone-deep cold struck from all directions. Yang Kai's expression grew stern; he quickly circulated his True Yuan to dispel the chill.

Feeling the scorching energy within his body, Qian Yue showed great displeasure; disgust colored her pretty face.

Everyone in the Ice Sect cultivated ice-based methods and Martial Skills, so they were most sensitive to and repelled by this opposing energy.

Inside the ice mountain everything was crystal-clear; the internal paths seemed paved with crystalline stone, exceptionally beautiful, dotted with strange luminous stones that illuminated the ice corridors and made them dazzling.

As they descended, Yang Kai's breathing gradually grew heavier; he could clearly feel that he was drawing closer to Su Yan.

After about half a teacup's time, the three came to a huge ice chamber. Qing Ya looked back at Yang Kai and said, "Su Yan is in there, but you have to promise me you won't get too agitated when you see her."

"I know," Yang Kai replied mildly.

Qing Ya nodded slightly and pushed open the ice chamber door, entering first with Yang Kai and Qian Yue following closely.

Inside the chamber there was nothing but an ice bed, and on that bed Su Yan lay with her eyes tightly shut as if she were in a deep sleep, her body wrapped in a block of ice.

Yang Kai's eyelids tightened; a raging fury rose in his chest, but he quickly suppressed it and slowly walked to the side of the ice bed.

Qing Ya and Qian Yue watched him closely, and the two of them found it strange — when this arrogant, vicious young man saw Su Yan, his fierce face became calm in an instant; a deep longing shone in his eyes, tenderness almost palpable.

His facial expressions fluctuated wildly, rich in emotion: some fear, some expectation, as he stepped closer and closer.

As he walked, his face settled into a calm demeanor.

Reaching the ice bed, Yang Kai gazed at the jade-like figure upon it, a faint smile curving the corner of his mouth.

Su Yan lay there, alive and unharmed, yet her whole body was encased in an unusually strange ice, as if she had frozen herself within; she showed no response to Yang Kai's arrival.

Yang Kai reached out a hand but could not touch her.

Yang Kai watched quietly. Su Yan’s expression was serene, her hands resting naturally upon her flat lower abdomen. It seemed that even before being sealed in ice, she was already resolved, for there was not the slightest trace of pain upon her face.

Moreover, her True Yuan continued to circulate rapidly inside her; the cultivation she practiced was still running, even swifter than usual.

Knowing Yang Kai's emotions were stirred, Qing Ya and Qian Yue politely kept silent and did not disturb him.

Time passed little by little; Qing Ya's expression did not change, while Qian Yue grew somewhat impatient.

More than two hundred Ice Sect disciples were facing great peril; if Yang Kai did not retrieve the Soul Devouring Worms within half an incense time, they would surely die. Unable to restrain herself, she urged, "Kid, how long do you plan to look? No matter how long you stare, you can't awaken her. She not only froze her body, she froze her consciousness as well."

Yang Kai suddenly turned his head and glared at her coldly.

Qian Yue unconsciously looked away, as if feeling a guilty conscience.

"Is this a Martial Skill?" Yang Kai asked, turning to Qing Ya.

Qing Ya nodded slightly. "Yes. It's a forbidden secret of our Ice Sect — Ice-Body Locking the Heart. After its execution, one condenses all their True Yuan and seals their body and mind in ice, instantly losing all sensations."

"Then why is my Senior Sister's cultivation still running?" Yang Kai frowned.

Qing Ya pursed her lips and smiled. "Ice-Body Locking the Heart also serves as an aid to cultivation. When an Ice Sect disciple uses it, they can force themselves into a state of desirelessness and thoughtlessness; in that state cultivation proceeds faster than usual. Many disciples perform this technique during seclusion, and depending on how much True Yuan and realization are invested when it's used, the duration of the Ice-Body Lock varies."

"How long will my Senior Sister remain in this state?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

Qing Ya's face darkened as she slowly shook her head. "It's hard to say — it could be ten years, it could be decades, or it could be forever… Su Yan's current cultivation energy has also been used to maintain the external freezing."

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. "Why would she freeze herself? Did someone mistreat her in your Ice Sect?"

Saying that, he shot an unfriendly look toward Qian Yue.

"You brat, what are you staring at me for? I like her enough already; why would I abuse her?" Qian Yue snapped, immediately annoyed.

"Don't be so hasty. Elder Qian Yue wouldn't mistreat Su Yan; she even wanted to accept your Senior Sister as a disciple," Qing Ya hastened to soothe.

"I don't think she's got that luck!" Yang Kai inwardly despised Qian Yue.

"However, this matter does indeed have something to do with Elder Qian Yue," Qing Ya sighed lightly. "She bears a share of the responsibility for Su Yan ending up like this."

Qian Yue's expression dimmed; she said painfully, "I never expected her to end up like this, nor did I know when she learned Ice-Body Locking the Heart. Had I known earlier… I wouldn't have pressured her so much. Ah!"

Saying that, she glared at Yang Kai and snorted, "Kid, I won't deny that point, but I did it for her good, not to harm her!"

"So what exactly happened?" Yang Kai's gaze flared. Qian Yue's words were only her side of the story; the true situation still needed to be clarified.

"Qian Yue, you tell it," Qing Ya said, rubbing her forehead.

Qian Yue nodded slightly and then related, in detail, what had happened to Su Yan after she entered the Ice Sect.

Two years ago, Meng Wuya suddenly brought Xia Ningshang and Su Yan to the Ice Sect and sought out Qing Ya, entrusting Su Yan to her temporary care.

The Ice Sect lived reclusively in this glacial world and generally did not accept outsiders, but Meng Wuya had some acquaintance with Qing Ya. Unable to resist that old fellow's shameless nagging, Qing Ya had no choice but to agree.

After entrusting Su Yan here, Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang left.

"That old man said the matter he was going to undertake was dangerous; he could bring his own disciple, but he couldn't put Su Yan at risk, so he secretly left her behind. It wasn't until he had departed that Su Yan learned the truth and had to stay in the Ice Sect for a while," Qian Yue explained.

Yang Kai slightly nodded. What Shopkeeper Meng did couldn't be blamed; he certainly hadn't told Su Yan his real purpose for bringing her to the Ice Sect — otherwise, given Su Yan's nature, she would have followed him to help and not stayed living an easy life in the Ice Sect.

"And then?" Yang Kai asked.

"Then the Sect Leader entrusted Su Yan to me. At first I paid her little attention — when she arrived her strength wasn't low, but neither was it high. Soon, however, I discovered she possessed unmatched talent and progressed at an astonishing speed. Most remarkable was that the cultivation she practiced was compatible with our Ice Sect — all ice-based techniques! I thought that old man must have planned this long ago when he entrusted Su Yan to us."

The corner of Yang Kai's mouth twitched; it would be strange if Meng Wuya had not planned this. He must know many experts on the Tongxuan Continent; Chu Lingxiao, for example, was an old acquaintance. Yet Meng Wuya sent Su Yan here, plainly recognizing the Ice Sect's foundation.

Meng Wuya's move was meant to have the Ice Sect teach Su Yan for free.

If it were Yang Kai, he would have done the same.
