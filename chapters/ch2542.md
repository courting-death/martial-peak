## Chapter 2542 — No Way Forward or Back

The voices of those discussing naturally reached Yang Kai’s ears. Far from feeling reassured, his expression grew even more grave. He quietly asked, “Old Ban, when the howling wind comes, are you certain the ghost creatures won’t appear?”

Old Ban replied in a low voice, “Normally, they won’t. The howling wind is extremely powerful—even the ghosts here can hardly withstand it. If they rush out recklessly, they might be blown to dust. It’s just that…”

“Just what?”

Old Ban hesitated, then explained, “But nothing in this world is absolute. It’s not that the ghost creatures can’t come out during the howling wind—they simply don’t want to. I’ve actually seen it happen once before. It’s rare, but not impossible, so you shouldn’t let your guard down…”

Old Ban’s eyes suddenly widened, staring straight at the cave entrance with a look of shock. From within the strange mist, more than a dozen semi-transparent figures suddenly rushed out.

Those figures appeared human-shaped, but were somewhat blurry, making it hard to distinguish their features.

Yet every one of those figures radiated an extremely violent and chilling aura.

As soon as those dozen semi-transparent figures burst from the mist, each one opened its mouth and let out a vicious howl. Their blurred faces instantly twisted into ferocious, terrifying visages, as if ready to tear anyone nearby to shreds.

“Damn, it’s the Yin-Souls! They’re really charging in—whose mouth brought this bad luck?”

“Everyone, be careful!”

At the cave entrance, several martial artists cried out in alarm, no longer daring to sit cross-legged. They all sprang up to defend themselves.

These few were at the very edge of the cave, so when the Yin-Souls rushed in, they were the first to bear the brunt, unable to retreat or advance. All they could do was fight desperately to resist.

In an instant, beams of light burst from their hands as one Secret Treasure after another was summoned, rumbling as they struck at the Yin-Souls.

Anyone able to seize a spot in this cave was not ordinary, but at this moment, their attacks had little effect on the ghost creatures—only causing the semi-transparent figures to pause slightly, not killing a single one.

“Not good. These are all Ghost Generals!” Someone cried out in alarm.

Ghost creatures had ranks too, from ordinary Yin-Souls to Ghost Generals, Ghost Commanders, and even Ghost Kings. Each rank was stronger than the last.

Ordinary Yin-Souls weren’t particularly dangerous—even someone like Old Ban could handle them with ease. But once Ghost Generals or Ghost Commanders appeared, Old Ban was no match for them. As for the Ghost King, he was the undisputed ruler of the ancient passage—even those in the Emperor Realm dared not take him lightly.

When the Ghost King acted earlier, Old Ban and Zhang Ruoxi had no power to resist. If Yang Kai hadn’t been there to protect them, the two would have died without even knowing how.

So when they heard these were all Ghost General level Yin-Souls, everyone in the cave turned pale, each feeling endangered.

All attacks landing on these Ghost Generals failed to inflict fatal wounds. After a brief pause, they pounced even more fiercely.

However, those at the cave entrance were clearly long-time residents of the Ancient Land, highly experienced in dealing with ghost creatures. Each one was fully prepared, faces grim. When the Ghost Generals approached within a zhang, they suddenly unleashed Divine Soul energy, launching their Divine Soul attacks.

Waves of invisible force struck the Ghost Generals fiercely.

Amid a chorus of shrill, tragic screams, most of the Ghost Generals were wiped out in an instant. The few that survived were left dim and battered, their bodies flickering weakly—clearly gravely wounded. Yet these Ghost Generals possessed no intelligence; even when gravely injured, they continued to snarl and lunge forward, ferocious and relentless as ever.

Another burst of Divine Soul power, and the remaining Ghost Generals followed their companions into oblivion.

Seeing this, the martial artists at the cave entrance couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.

Though their cultivation meant they didn’t fear Ghost Generals, they were hiding from the howling wind and didn’t want any trouble. Fortunately, there weren’t many Ghost Generals, so they were easily dealt with.

“There’s more!” Yang Kai suddenly tensed, calling out in a low voice.

“What?” The few at the entrance changed expression, but before they could ask, they understood what Yang Kai meant.

From the strange mist, another batch of Ghost Generals rushed out, their violent, savage aura identical to the previous group.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

More and more Yin-Souls appeared, their auras varying in strength—some were ordinary Yin-Souls, some Ghost Generals, and even Ghost Commanders among them.

In the blink of an eye, the entire area outside the cave was densely surrounded by Yin-Souls. The countless semi-transparent figures created the illusion of falling into the Underworld itself.

“Gulp!”

The sound of swallowing echoed, as everyone stared at the cave entrance with ugly expressions, deeply uneasy.

“How… could this happen!”

“Why are so many ghost creatures coming out during the howling wind?”

“What on earth is going on?”

“Enough talk—if you don’t want to die, start killing!”

The crowd, who had just settled down, cried out in shock, unable to believe what they were seeing. As they hesitated, the ghost creatures launched another attack.

The few at the entrance had no choice but to desperately unleash their Divine Soul power, using Origin Qi to slay the Yin-Souls. Divine Soul energy burst forth again and again.

The shrill screams rose and fell, as Yin-Souls were wiped out one after another. Yet the Yin-Souls seemed endless—the more they killed, the more appeared, and the number didn’t decrease at all.

This situation left them nearly hopeless!

The most effective way to destroy Yin-Souls was to wait until they’re close and use Divine Soul power. But Divine Soul power wasn’t inexhaustible—every use consumed a lot, and once it was depleted, all that was left is to wait for death.

Moreover, overusing Divine Soul power could damage one’s foundation, something no martial artist wanted to face.

In less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, those at the entrance had turned pale, drenched in cold sweat, clearly exhausted.

“Brothers in the back, help us out—we can’t hold on much longer!”

"Exactly! If we fall here, you’ll be next—when the skin is gone, how can the hair survive? Hurry up and lend a hand!"

“Can someone cover for me? I need to rest—my Divine Soul power is almost spent. I’d be deeply grateful.”

…

Inside the cave, the remaining eight or nine people looked grim. Everyone understood the principle of lips and teeth depending on each other, but in such a crisis, who dared step up? If their own Divine Soul power ran dry and no one replaced them, they’d die miserably.

Everyone looks out for themselves—heaven and earth forgive no one who doesn’t.

So although everyone looked serious, no one made a move, let alone replaced those at the entrance.

“Old Ban, do you think it could be…” Yang Kai quietly glanced at Old Ban, sending a voice transmission.

Old Ban only thought for a moment before nodding slightly, “It’s possible.”

When the howling wind swept through, ghost creatures usually stayed hidden. Yet the current situation defied explanation. Judging by the way these Yin-Souls surged forward, it seemed they had their sights set on this cave—as if someone inside had become their sworn enemy.

This inevitably made Yang Kai think of the Ghost King from before!

That Ghost King suffered a setback at his hands—maybe this was all related. The Ghost King knew it can’t beat Yang Kai, so it was using this chance to mobilize the ghost creatures in the passage, trying to trap Yang Kai here.

Yang Kai was formidable, but right now he had nowhere to escape. As long as the ghost creatures kept attacking, sooner or later they’d kill him.

If that was true, then Yang Kai was the real culprit—everyone else was just collateral damage.

While Yang Kai and Old Ban were secretly communicating, someone inside the cave suddenly stood up and shouted, “Everyone, at this life-and-death moment, if we want to survive, we must work together!”

“Right, right, we must unite! Rare to see a brother so righteous—hurry over and help me hold the line. I’ll offer twenty million Source Crystals as thanks!” A Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator at the entrance quickly responded, his face pale and clearly struggling to hold on. He wished he could drag the speaker over right now so he could rest.

The speaker glanced at him and said loudly, “Friend, wait a moment. Let me discuss with everyone—won’t take long.”

“Discuss my ass! If we keep discussing, we’ll be dead.”

“Hmph, we’re holding the line here while you all sit back and enjoy the show. There’s no such thing as a free ride! If you don’t help, don’t blame me for letting some ghost creatures in.”

“Exactly! If we die, everyone dies—no one gets to survive alone!”

The man frowned and said, “Everyone, please calm down. Give me thirty breaths—I’ll come up with a plan that satisfies you all.”

Hearing this, the martial artists fighting at the entrance stopped shouting, because the man sounded sincere. They wanted to hear what he had to say.

And thirty breaths—they could hold out that long.

Seeing no objections, the man cupped his fists again, “I am Qi Hefeng of the Qi Family Stronghold—greetings, friends!”

“Qi Family Stronghold!” Yang Kai’s heart stirred, turning to look at Qi Hefeng, just as Qi Hefeng glanced back at him.

Their eyes met, and Qi Hefeng gave Yang Kai a slight smile.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but sniff, wondering if this guy recognized him—otherwise, why smile like that?

“So you’re from Qi Family Stronghold—long heard the name!”

As soon as Qi Hefeng revealed his background, many people showed understanding. It seemed everyone had heard of the Qi Family Stronghold before. After all, it was a notable force near the Ancient Land, with some prestige.

Qi Hefeng didn’t waste words, getting straight to the point: “I’m sure you all see the situation. If those friends at the front die of exhaustion, the next to be attacked will be us. These Yin-Soul ghost creatures seem endless—we don’t know how many there are. If they pick us off one by one, I doubt many of us will survive.”

“So I sincerely ask everyone to set aside personal grudges, cooperate wholeheartedly, and resist together. Only then do we have a sliver of hope!”
