## Chapter 2260 — The Consequence of Offending Me

"Hm?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Qin Chaoyang said, "Only in your hands can this sword display its true power. Brother Yang, keep it for now. If one day Yu'er manages to advance to the Emperor Realm, then you can return the sword to her. How about it?"

He looked as if entrusting his last wishes, arranging his affairs before death.

Yang Kai's eyes flickered slightly, understanding that Qin Chaoyang was making preparations for unforeseen circumstances.

Although Qin Chaoyang was no longer young, he was still a Dao Origin Realm cultivator. If nothing unexpected happened, living another hundred years or so would be no problem at all.

But his cultivation was not particularly high. In this Star Realm, the path of a cultivator was fraught with thorns at every step. Who could guarantee a good end? Perhaps disaster would strike out of nowhere, and he might lose everything in some unexpected turmoil.

If that day truly came, there would be no one left to protect the Qin Family.

Qin Chaoyang wanted Yang Kai to safeguard the Myriad Sword. First, because an innocent man with a treasure invites trouble—he feared the Myriad Sword would bring calamity to the Qin Family. Second, he likely hoped to use this as a link to draw Yang Kai closer to the Qin Family.

As long as the Myriad Sword was in Yang Kai's hands, he would not stand by if something happened to the Qin Family. If anything befell Qin Chaoyang, at least someone would be there to look after Qin Yu.

Yang Kai quickly understood Qin Chaoyang's intentions. After a moment's thought, he agreed and said, "Since the Qin Family Head trusts me so much, I will use this sword for a while. I will not disgrace the honor of the Qin Family ancestors!"

The Myriad Sword suited him well. He had already comprehended the sword techniques that could be used with this treasure, so keeping it for a while longer was not a problem.

"Excellent, excellent!" Qin Chaoyang was overjoyed.

Rumble...

At that moment, a muffled thunderous sound suddenly came from beneath the earth. It was as if thousands of dragon horses were galloping by, shaking the heavens and earth. At the same time, the Spiritual Qi in the world surged violently.

"What is going on?" Qin Chaoyang's expression changed as he shouted in alarm.

Yang Kai's eyes flashed with sharp light. His powerful Divine Sense instantly spread out to probe the surroundings. Soon, his gaze turned toward a direction outside the city, and he said in a low voice, "The source seems to be over there. It feels like something extraordinary has awakened."

"Let's go take a look!" Qin Chaoyang ordered decisively upon hearing this.

Yang Kai had the same thought. The two exchanged a glance and immediately used their movement techniques to rush outside.

Just as they flew out of the Qin Family, a beautiful figure appeared ahead, standing quietly in midair. It was none other than Ye Qinghan of the Chiyue Sect.

This woman seemed to have never left, always waiting outside the Qin Family.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Ye Qinghan's beautiful eyes lit up and she called out sweetly, "Master Yang, Master Yang!"

"Move aside, move aside, don't block the way!" Yang Kai waved impatiently, flying past her. In the blink of an eye, he was just a tiny black dot in the distance.

Gritting her teeth as she watched his back, Ye Qinghan stomped her foot and hurriedly chased after him.

"Qin Family Head..." As Yang Kai sped ahead, he glanced back at Ye Qinghan and asked in a low voice, "Did this woman tell you what she wanted with me?"

Qin Chaoyang grinned and said, "Brother Yang, now that your reputation is soaring, and you are so handsome and talented, it's only natural that you attract the admiration of some women."

Yang Kai ran a hand through his hair, straightened his posture, and lifted his head slightly...

In the next instant, he put on a serious face and said, "I'm being serious."

Qin Chaoyang shook his head and replied, "She didn't tell me much, only that she wanted to talk to you. I think she's quite a good woman. Although she's a bit older than you, her figure is delicate, and there's a hint of charm at the corners of her eyes. She must be a rare beauty. Brother Yang, why not consider her proposal more carefully?"

Yang Kai widened his eyes and looked Qin Chaoyang up and down, as if reassessing him. After a long while, he said, "Qin Family Head, have some self-respect! You're not young anymore. Isn't it inappropriate to say such things?"

"Hahahaha!" Qin Chaoyang laughed heartily, patting Yang Kai on the shoulder and said earnestly, "A man who isn't romantic in his youth will regret it. Young people should seize their opportunities!"

"It's definitely nothing good. I won't bother with her!" Yang Kai curled his lips.

As they spoke, more and more streaks of light appeared around them. Clearly, these were Dao Origin Realm experts living in Fenglin City who had sensed the disturbance and were heading over to investigate.

"Ah! Yang Kai, you beast!" A voice suddenly came from the side, filled with extreme anger.

Yang Kai turned his head and immediately saw a familiar face glaring at him with bloodshot eyes.

It was none other than Zhuang Pan, the former Vice City Lord of Fenglin City!

Beside Zhuang Pan stood a young man with red lips and white teeth, handsome in appearance but with low cultivation—only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

For some reason, Yang Kai suddenly found this fellow somewhat familiar, though he was certain they had never met before.

"Yang Kai!" The young man beside Zhuang Pan's eyes flashed with sharp light as he stared at Yang Kai and asked Zhuang Pan, "Is that the brat surnamed Yang?"

"Yes, Young Palace Master, that's the little beast!" Zhuang Pan replied through gritted teeth.

"Who are you calling a beast?" Yang Kai looked at Zhuang Pan with disdain and sneered.

Zhuang Pan's face turned ashen, but he wasn't foolish enough to fall into Yang Kai's trap. He simply stared at him with endless hatred and resentment in his eyes.

"Qin Family Head, who is that young man?" Yang Kai quietly asked Qin Chaoyang. He noticed that although the youth was handsome, his expression was sinister, and since he was associating with Zhuang Pan, he couldn't be a good person.

"Fei Sheng Palace, Young Palace Master Ning Yuanshu!"

"Young Palace Master?" Yang Kai was surprised, but quickly understood. The original Young Palace Master of Fei Sheng Palace must have died, so the Palace Master appointed a new one. Since this Ning Yuanshu and Ning Yuancheng were brothers, their appearances were naturally similar. No wonder he looked familiar.

As they spoke, Ning Yuanshu ordered Zhuang Pan, "Since it's him, there's no need for courtesy. Zhuang Pan, seize him for me. I have some questions for him."

Upon hearing this, Zhuang Pan's face immediately wrinkled like a bitter melon. He looked at Ning Yuanshu pitifully and stammered, "Young Palace Master, th-this..."

"What are you stammering for? Hurry up and do it! Do you dare disobey me?" Ning Yuanshu grew angry at his hesitation and slapped Zhuang Pan on the back of the head, making him shrink his neck.

"I... I can't beat him," Zhuang Pan said bitterly. After speaking, he deflated like a punctured ball, losing all his momentum.

Ning Yuanshu glared at him and said, "He's at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and so are you. Father even personally instructed you for three days. Why can't you beat him?"

"Last time, he beat me badly. Even my Secret Treasure lost its spirit..." Zhuang Pan muttered.

"Useless! What do I need you for?" Ning Yuanshu roared in anger, kicking Zhuang Pan in the waist and sending him stumbling aside with a miserable cry.

Ning Yuanshu didn't even spare Zhuang Pan a glance. Instead, he glared at Yang Kai and shouted coldly, "Brat, get over here!"

He acted as if he were the ruler of the world, expecting everyone to obey his commands without question.

The surrounding martial artists were all shocked by his words and quickly moved away from Ning Yuanshu.

Most of these martial artists had just returned from the Qin Family. They had witnessed Yang Kai's earlier outburst and knew how difficult he was to provoke. Now, seeing Ning Yuanshu daring to provoke a tiger, none of them dared to stay near him.

Even those who didn't know the details were quietly warned by acquaintances through secret voice transmissions.

In an instant, all the martial artists within fifty zhang of Ning Yuanshu cleared out.

Ning Yuanshu, completely oblivious, thought the crowd had cleared out because they were awed by his imposing presence. He puffed himself up even more, strutting about with an air of absolute arrogance, as if he alone ruled the world.

"Qin Family Head..." Yang Kai said with a strange expression, raising his voice, "Why does it sound like a dog is barking out here in the wilderness?"

Qin Chaoyang laughed loudly, "Probably just a stray dog from somewhere. Brother Yang, pay it no mind!"

In the past, as the head of a small family, he would never have dared to offend Fei Sheng Palace. Although Fei Sheng Palace wasn't a top sect, it still had an Emperor Realm expert overseeing it, and countless Dao Origin Realm cultivators within its ranks.

Offending such a force would spell the end for the Qin Family. They could easily send a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator to wipe out the entire Qin Family.

But now, he was deeply grateful to Yang Kai. For Yang Kai's sake, he didn't care about offending Fei Sheng Palace—or even the Star God Palace, for that matter.

The two of them played off each other, their voices loud enough for everyone to hear. This only made Ning Yuanshu even angrier, his rage nearly bursting out of him.

"You have guts, brat! Do you even know who I am, daring to speak so boldly?" Ning Yuanshu laughed in his fury, his voice cold as he glared at Yang Kai.

Only then did Yang Kai glance at him sideways and say, "And who are you supposed to be?"

He looked utterly disdainful, which only made Ning Yuanshu's anger burn hotter. Ning Yuanshu shouted, "Listen up! I am Ning Yuanshu, Young Palace Master of Fei Sheng Palace!"

"Young Palace Master of Fei Sheng Palace?" Yang Kai widened his eyes in mock surprise and said, "You're the Young Palace Master of Fei Sheng Palace?"

"That's right!" Seeing Yang Kai's startled expression, Ning Yuanshu was very pleased, his face cold as a snake as he smiled, as if to say, "Now you're scared."

The next moment, Yang Kai's face turned serious and he said, "Sorry, never heard of you."

"You..." Ning Yuanshu's face changed at these words. He immediately realized Yang Kai was toying with him and roared, "Brat, you deserve to die!"

As he spoke, he urged his Origin Qi, formed a seal with his hands, and a vortex of power spread out from his body. In the next instant, his figure blurred, leaving several afterimages in the air as he lunged at Yang Kai, striking at his chest with his palm.

"This is the consequence of offending me!" He couldn't help but sneer as he attacked.

However, this palm was destined to miss. Yang Kai simply reached out and guided the attack aside.

Caught off guard, Ning Yuanshu lost his balance and nearly fell onto Yang Kai.

Looking up, he saw Yang Kai's face just three inches away, smiling at him. Their faces were almost touching, and Yang Kai's smile was full of mockery and ridicule.
