## Chapter 20 — Burning the House

Su Mu looked on with satisfaction at the reactions of the crowd, a faint snort of disdain escaping his nostrils.

Although the challenge against Yang Kai had been set by Su Mu today, the gathered onlookers did not disperse. They did not know exactly how Yang Kai had offended Su Mu, so naturally, they stayed to witness the unfolding drama.

After waiting a while longer with no sign of Yang Kai, Su Mu’s patience began to wane. “Where is he?”

“No one knows. Usually, he would have come out to sweep by now, but today, for some reason, he hasn’t appeared. Young Master Su, shall we go check where he lives?”

Su Mu pondered briefly, then nodded. “Very well. A mere sweeper dares to keep me waiting? I’ll make him regret it!”

Yang Kai’s residence was no secret. A few of Su Mu’s men immediately led the way.

The crowd eager for spectacle followed in a great throng.

After a short while, they arrived before Yang Kai’s humble hut. The dilapidated wooden shack, riddled with gaps that let the wind through, stirred an inexplicable sense of satisfaction in Su Mu. Pointing at the hut, he said, “That brat lives here?”

“Respectfully, Young Master Su, Yang Kai is a Trial Disciple. He must fend for himself in all things—food, clothing, shelter. The sect does not provide for him. This is likely a hut he built himself.”

“Good, good,” Su Mu said with relish. The thought of Yang Kai being drenched like a drowned rat in the rain lifted his spirits immensely.

Clearing his throat and suppressing a smile, Su Mu strode forward with the confidence of a dragon and tiger, his voice ringing out: “Hey, Yang Kai! Come out here and face your death!”

His shout thundered like a bell, heavy with hatred and a cry soaked in blood and tears. The crowd shuddered at the intensity, silently acknowledging the deep grudge between Yang Kai and Su Mu.

Su Mu stood proudly, unmoved by the wind, eyes fixed on the door of the hut, imagining Yang Kai scrambling out in fear and begging for mercy. The more he thought about it, the more triumphant he felt.

But no matter how long he waited, there was no movement from within.

His face flushed with embarrassment. With another roar, he bellowed, “Yang Kai! If you know what’s good for you, come out quickly! Otherwise, we’ll break in!”

Still, no response.

Su Mu’s unease grew. If Yang Kai were inside, surely he would have breathed by now. Could it be that he wasn’t there?

He glanced at one of his subordinates and gave a subtle signal. The man dashed forward, kicked open the door with agile strength, and hurried inside.

After a short while, the man returned and reported, “Young Master Su, no one’s inside. There’s even some dust settled. It seems that brat knew trouble was coming and left several days ago.”

“Left?” Su Mu nearly spat blood. He had schemed for days, brought so many people to bolster his presence today, and yet Yang Kai had fled?

It was like throwing a fierce punch only to have it land on cotton—an indescribable sense of powerlessness and frustration overwhelmed Su Mu.

“Come to think of it, I haven’t seen Yang Kai these past few days.”

“A wise man knows when to retreat. Yang Kai must have offended this Su Mu and, sensing impending disaster, left the sect.”

“No wonder he hasn’t shown up until now.”

“Alas, with Yang Kai gone, there will be no more free Contribution Points.”

The murmurs of the crowd reached Su Mu’s ears word for word.

Though triumphant in a way, Su Mu was still displeased at failing to exact revenge.

His face darkened as he pondered, but he had to accept reality. With a scowl, he declared, “That brat got off easy. But this grudge will not be forgotten. Set fire to this broken hut and burn it to ashes.”

The crowd gasped in shock. Even Su Mu’s own men hesitated. One ventured, “Young Master Su, setting fire inside the sect grounds—isn’t that unwise?”

“What’s there to fear?” Su Mu glared. “If the sky falls, I’ll hold it up. Besides, this isn’t sect property. Burn it if you want. This shabby hut offends my eyes.”

Hearing this, the crowd’s doubts were dispelled. After all, Young Master Su had powerful backing. Burning a broken hut was nothing.

Someone went to fetch fire and dry grass.

Soon, all was ready. Su Mu’s face twisted into a grimace as he held a torch freshly made on the spot, the blazing flames casting wild shadows across his distorted features.

“Yang Kai, if I ever meet you again, I’ll make you wish you were dead!” Su Mu snarled through clenched teeth, about to hurl the torch into the hut.

Suddenly, a sharp scent of blood wafted over him. A hand landed on his shoulder, and a voice asked, “What are you doing?”

Without hesitation, Su Mu answered, “Burning the house.”

“Burning my house?” The voice carried a hint of irritation.

“Your house?” Su Mu sneered and turned to look at the newcomer. At once, he leapt aside like a startled rabbit, his movements nimble beyond reason. He assumed a defensive stance, face pale with panic, every hair standing on end.

The man before him was a terrifying sight. His clothes were tattered and filthy, hair wild and tangled like weeds, his body covered in countless bloodstains. His garments were soaked in blood, and a small, bulging bundle hung from his shoulder—its contents unknown.

A breeze stirred his ragged trousers, revealing a leg thickly covered in coarse hair.

What unsettled Su Mu most was the man’s scent—a nauseating mix of blood and sweat that made one want to vomit and lose their appetite for days.

Such an appearance and aura were truly bizarre.

If he had a broken bowl in hand, he would be a perfect image of a beggar living off others’ charity.

Yet… why did he seem somewhat familiar?

Su Mu scrutinized the man carefully, growing more puzzled by the moment. Then suddenly, he slapped his thigh. “Yang Kai!”

Who else could it be? Though his appearance had changed and his face was smeared with grime, to Su Mu—who bore him a grudge—there was no mistaking him.

Yang Kai recognized Su Mu as well. He grinned, revealing sharp white fangs. “Isn’t this the heroic Su Junior Brother who made a name for himself in Wumei Town?”

The taunt flushed Su Mu’s face red and pale in turn. He stamped his foot and shouted, “Yang Kai, you refuse the path to heaven and barge into hell! Today, you shall die.”

“Looking for trouble?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Of course!” Su Mu boasted. “Did you think I came to visit you?”

“Then why burn my house?” Yang Kai demanded.

Su Mu quickly threw down the torch and stomped on it fiercely, as if stamping on Yang Kai himself. The act was immensely satisfying. After a long moment, the flames were finally extinguished.

This delay finally brought the crowd back to their senses. Only now did they realize Yang Kai had not fled Lingxiao Pavilion out of fear of Su Mu, but had gone out to deal with some matter.

But what could have brought him to such a wretched state? The amount of blood was staggering. The scratches on his clothes were clearly from some sharp weapon. Had he fought a life-or-death battle?
