## Chapter 1320 — A Brief Talk on Life

In response to Shen Shitao’s question, Yang Kai merely explained that Qian Yue was an old acquaintance of his and didn’t go into detail. Even though Shen Shitao was somewhat suspicious, she wasn’t foolish enough to press further and risk making herself unwelcome.

Yang Yan, however, looked Qian Yue over with contemplative eyes, her heart filled with unsettled doubt.

Shen Shitao and the others were unaware of Yang Kai's background, but Yang Yan knew him all too well.

Yang Kai had come from the outside and was not a native of Dark Star; now, unexpectedly, one of his old acquaintances had appeared — could it be that this woman, who was First Stage of the Saint King Realm, also came from beyond?

She never would have imagined that Qian Yue not only came from the outside, but also hailed from the same place as Yang Kai.

After the guests and host took their seats, Shen Shitao immediately began asking where Shen Fanlei had gone and why he was so late returning. Shen Fanlei's face flushed as he turned pleading eyes toward Yang Kai, utterly at a loss for how to explain.

He couldn't very well tell his sister that, bored in the night, he had gone to a brothel with Yang Kai — and that Yang Kai had been the one to take him there. If he said that, he'd surely be scolded later.

Seeing Shen Fanlei hesitate and look awkward, Shen Shitao seemed to guess something. She turned and smiled sweetly at Yang Kai: "Brother Yang, where exactly did you and Fanlei go last night? Why do I smell some strange perfume?"

Yang Kai glanced at Shen Fanlei, who was frantically winking at him, and let out a wry smile. “Brother Shen,” he said, “if nothing unexpected had happened tonight, I’d have kept quiet. But with all that’s occurred, it’s probably impossible to hide anymore. You’d best tell her the truth.”

Upon hearing that, Shen Fanlei immediately drooped in spirit.

After hesitating, he gritted his teeth and recounted the events of the night in detail.

When they heard that the two had indeed gone to such an establishment, Shen Shitao's pretty face grew so cold it might have scraped off a layer of frost; yet when she learned the story was so convoluted and that Wang Yuhan had meddled in it, she was astonished. Hearing Yang Kai explain the hazards and hidden dangers of that Dual Cultivation Technique to martial artists, her complexion drained and she hurriedly asked, "Fanlei, you didn't really…"

Shen Fanlei hurriedly waved his hands. "No, no. Thanks to Yang Brother's prior warning, I only spoke with that girl briefly about life, and nothing else happened beyond that."

Lü Ying, listening nearby, snickered, and even the vexed and worried Shen Shitao couldn't help but suppress a smile.

Going into a place like that, paying the fees, and then doing nothing substantial — instead pulling the girl into a talk about life — only Shen Fanlei could be guilty of such a thing. That poor girl who accompanied him must have been completely baffled.

But precisely because of that, Shen Shitao finally set her mind at ease.

She pondered for a moment, her beautiful eyes full of killing intent as she said, "So then, Fanlei, you went to such a place because of an offhand remark by Wang Yuhan? And Brother Yang was merely there to give you courage."

"Whether it was an offhand remark I can't say, but he did go to Hehuan House in advance, and he kept maneuvering against me at every turn to obstruct what I intended to do," Yang Kai said calmly.

Shen Shitao's expression shifted slightly. After thinking, she said, "Wang Yuhan should know Fanlei's temperament very well and what to say at what time, and how his words would affect Fanlei. It seems his ultimate target was you, Brother Yang, and Fanlei was just a stepping stone. How hateful. That man would do such a thing to deal with you and not care about Fanlei's future — where is the slightest trace of a Senior Brother in him? If he had succeeded this time, wouldn't Fanlei be unable to advance further?"

This time, Wang Yuhan’s actions seemed to have truly touched Shen Shitao’s reverse scale, enraging her greatly. Her eyes were filled with icy cold fury.

"Fanlei, you should have no further dealings with such a person. Once you return to Jidao Sect, report this matter to your master."

"Ah, report it to Master as well… about entering Hehuan House…" Shen Fanlei hesitated at once.

"Of course you must tell him everything down to the last detail. What? You don't want to? If you won't, I'll go to Jidao Sect myself!" Shen Shitao glared and snapped.

Shen Fanlei didn't dare argue and obediently nodded.

He believed that after this incident, even if Wang Yuhan wasn’t expelled from Jidao Sect, he would surely face a severe punishment—and the former seemed far more likely.

Shen Shitao fumed for a while, then suddenly remembered something. She smoothed her anger, offered a graceful salute to Yang Kai, and said, "This time we owe you, Brother Yang. If not for you, Fanlei might have fallen for that scoundrel's trap. I thank you."

Yang Kai waved his hand. "This matter was more my fault for involving Brother Shen; it's not his mistake. Well, what's done is done. But there's one more thing I should tell Miss Shen."

"What is it? Speak freely, Brother Yang."

Yang Kai flipped his hand and a piece of something like deadwood appeared in his palm, charred black and utterly devoid of any scent or aura, looking like an ordinary scrap of deadwood.

"Miss Shen, do you recognize this?" Yang Kai asked.

Shen Shitao frowned and examined it, hesitating; for a moment she could not identify it.

“Eh? Is this Beast-Luring Incense?” Shen Fanlei exclaimed in surprise from the side.

"It seems Brother Shen knows something about it; then you must also know where it came from," Yang Kai looked at him.

"Yes. I used this with Senior Brother Wang before to lure out a particularly stealthy demonic beast. It's very effective: once lit, it attracts nearby demonic beasts, and it's colorless and scentless — we martial artists couldn't detect any aura," Shen Fanlei explained. "So Yang Brother has Beast-Luring Incense too, but it seems this one has been mostly burnt away. Where did you get it?"

"Zangxiong Valley, beside the Thunder Pool!" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Shen Fanlei was stunned, and Shen Shitao's eyes flickered with thought; then her expression changed drastically as she stared at Yang Kai in astonishment.

"Actually, I didn't discover this myself — Yang Yan found it. While collecting Thunder Liquid she stumbled across it. If Yang Yan hadn't been so knowledgeable about odd things, she might have missed it!" Yang Kai handed the Beast-Luring Incense to Shen Shitao, then asked Shen Fanlei, "Brother Shen, forgive my doubting your integrity: has your Senior Brother ever been to the Thunder Pool before?"

"You mean…" Shen Shitao narrowed her eyes.

"Miss Shen knows perfectly well, why ask?" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Shen Shitao nodded lightly and then asked Shen Fanlei, "Fanlei, has Wang Yuhan ever been to the Thunder Pool?"

"Yes, he has. A few years ago he accompanied another Senior Brother there. That Senior Brother, like me, cultivated that secret technique and relied on the Thunder Pool to breakthrough. So when I sought to breakthrough this time, Senior Brother Wang suggested going there," Shen Fanlei scratched his head, bewildered. "Why? Is there a problem?"

Shen Shitao clenched her teeth and said coldly, "It seems that when we were endangered at the Thunder Pool last time, Wang Yuhan had a hand in it."

"Impossible!" Shen Fanlei cried. "Why would Senior Brother Wang do such a thing? And if Yang Brother hadn't arrived in time, he might have perished!"

Shen Shitao shook her head. "I don't know the specifics, but if I'm right, when Wang Yuhan went to the Thunder Pool years ago he must have discovered that Silver Night Thunder Beast. At that time it was probably only Eighth-Tier, and you saw it — it only recently rose to Ninth-Tier, which Wang Yuhan did not foresee, so he himself fell into danger. As for why he did it…"

"Most likely to manufacture danger so he could rescue the beauty and win her favor," Yang Kai snorted, finishing Shen Shitao's unspoken thought.

Shen Shitao's face flushed and she shot Yang Kai a glare, but she did not deny the point — she evidently agreed.

Shen Fanlei, hearing this, looked crushed and murmured, "How could Senior Brother be such a person?"

The peril at the Thunder Pool and the incident in Hehuan House both bore Wang Yuhan's shadow, and Shen Fanlei found it hard to accept.

"Fanlei, you are inexperienced and too trusting; it's understandable. Just be more cautious in future. You've met a benefactor in Brother Yang who helped you several times, but you may not be so lucky next time," Shen Shitao said earnestly.

Shen Fanlei nodded subconsciously.

As Shen Shitao lectured Fanlei, Yang Kai remained silent. In truth, he hadn't intended at first to expose the Beast-Luring Incense incident; although Wang Yuhan had tampered, he had done so in pursuit of a beauty — Yang Kai saw no need to ruin a man's chance.

But the events of this night made him thoroughly displeased, and he would no longer be polite to Wang Yuhan.

He had no qualms about stomping on such a miserly little man a few more times.

After such incidents, Shen Shitao was in no mood to stay. She left at once with Lü Ying and Shen Fanlei, looking as if she intended to give Fanlei a good dressing-down.

Once they had gone, Yang Kai told Qian Yue, "Rest here for two days, then leave with us after that."

He then introduced Yang Yan and Qian Yue to each other. When Yang Yan learned Qian Yue came from the same continent as Yang Kai, she was surprised. Though she had been indifferent toward Shen Shitao, she was comparatively warm to this woman she'd just met; the two returned to a room together and seemed to have much to discuss.

Qian Yue, who wanted to ask about Yang Kai's circumstances, naturally did not refuse.

After the guests dispersed, Yang Kai returned alone to his chamber to rest.

Over the next two days Yang Kai stayed shut in within the Flying Flowers, Snow, and Moon Pavilion, and through those days of interaction Qian Yue and Yang Yan's relationship seemed to grow much more amicable.

It wasn't until noon on the third day that a maid from Feiling Hall came to report that Shen Shitao and the others had returned. Yang Kai was startled, released his Divine Sense, called to Qian Yue and Yang Yan, and went downstairs.
