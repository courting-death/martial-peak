## Chapter 818 — Exhilarating

When the Profound Heaven Sword first appeared, Zhang Ao didn’t think much of it. After all, Yang Kai’s cultivation wasn’t high, and he was casting it across a barrier—hardly a threat to a Second Stage Saint Realm expert like him.

But when it suddenly swelled for no apparent reason, Zhang Ao immediately felt a dangerous aura rush at him head-on.

It was as if the Profound Heaven Sword’s power had exploded severalfold in an instant.

He couldn’t ignore it at all.

With a deep shout, Zhang Ao hurriedly struck out to block.

Boom—

The greatsword cleaved down. Golden light burst forth, so dazzling that no one could keep their eyes open. Even someone as strong as Zhang Ao bent under the weight, nearly cut to the ground by that single stroke.

At his side, many Poxuan Palace cultivators swept by the golden radiance didn’t even have time to groan before they turned to ash in an instant, not a scrap left behind—as if they had never existed at all.

Faces around the field changed drastically.

No one had expected that the new Saint Lord of Nine Heavens Sacred Land, who a moment ago had seemed willing to reconcile with everyone, would in the blink of an eye strike to kill.

So decisive. So cold-blooded. Not a hint of hesitation.

He changed faces faster than turning a page.

Roars of fury and curses erupted from the Poxuan Palace camp. The warriors who had just lost kin and friends saw red in an instant; rage ignited in their chests as they glared at Yang Kai.

The cultivators of War Soul Hall and Netherworld Sect, however, recoiled several steps in fright. Feeling the terrifying might contained in that strike and witnessing its damage, they all turned ashen and trembled, instinctively looking for a safe spot.

Their formation suddenly fell into disarray.

The trembling of the earth rippled out underground. The warriors from the forces that had been incited to come had complex expressions. They stood farther away, and since Yang Kai’s strike had been aimed at Zhang Ao, they hadn’t been affected.

In that moment, they wavered, unsure if they should keep opposing Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The strong prey on the weak—that truth never changes. The previous Saintess of Nine Heavens Sacred Land had indeed brought calamity and incurred wrath, but if what the Sacred Land said was true, it had nothing to do with them. Besides, they had said they would compensate those who suffered losses.

That courage to admit responsibility alone was commendable. There weren’t many forces in the world like Nine Heavens Sacred Land that would acknowledge their own faults. If it were some other power, they would likely tell them to swallow it and do nothing.

If they withdrew now, they would not only avoid further losses but also receive compensation from Nine Heavens Sacred Land; with luck, they might even use this chance to forge a connection.

For a time, many hesitated.

Zhang Ao, Cao Guan, and Wu Jie stood stunned as if Yang Kai’s strike had rattled their minds blank.

No matter how they imagined it, they couldn’t conceive that Yang Kai—only at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm—could unleash a move that fierce.

It was a full-power blow comparable to a peak First Stage Saint Realm expert. Zhang Ao managed to block it, but his arms went numb, his Qi and blood churned, and his face flushed—he was clearly not feeling well.

As Saint Realm cultivators, under such power, all of them felt their lives threatened; their eyes trembled violently.

Having unleashed the Profound Heaven Sword, Yang Kai grinned at Zhang Ao and slowly extended his palm.

High above the Poxuan Palace crowd, Heaven and earth’s Spiritual Qi suddenly grew oppressively heavy. After a shift of wind and cloud, a gigantic palm print appeared, blanketing the sky.

Within another of the Nine Peaks, a mysterious, surging force burst out once more. Under that empowerment, the palm print grew thicker and more terrifying, blotting out everyone’s sight and plunging their vision into darkness.

The Heaven-Covering Palm—one hand to cover the sky!

Zhang Ao finally snapped back to himself. Teaming up with another Saint Realm expert of Poxuan Palace, he summoned his proudest Secret Treasure. Turning into rainbows, they shot into the air.

Whoosh, whoosh—

Two streaks of light tore through the firmament, punching two holes in the massive palm. The sky‑shrouding handprint showed a flaw and its momentum dropped, yet it still came slapping down with residual might.

Boom—

The ground shook violently. Outside the Nine Peaks barrier, a palm print several hundred zhang across appeared on the earth.

No fewer than dozens of Poxuan Palace cultivators failed to dodge and were smashed into pulp on the spot—deaths too miserable to look at, blood reek billowing to the heavens.

“So ruthless!” Several li away, Yun Cheng’s lids lowered as he exclaimed.

“So strong!” Standing beside him, Ji Yan felt a chill flood his body. Though he sensed Yang Kai’s cultivation was now on par with his own, such an attack shouldn’t be something at that level.

Ji Yan admitted that if he himself had been standing there, he would likely be gravely injured if not dead.

“He’s borrowing the power of the Nine Peaks Grand Array to multiply his own attacks,” Yun Cheng saw through the mystery at a glance. Although Yang Kai had struck only twice, each time one of the peaks had formed a subtle link with his move. It naturally couldn’t escape his notice. He breathed out lightly and his gaze dimmed. “It seems my Duao Alliance truly isn’t suited to meddle in this muddy water.”

The Duao Alliance had many disciples, but top experts were scarce; they didn’t even have a single Saint Realm cultivator. In a clash like this, Yun Cheng couldn’t help a sense of powerless frustration—and an even fiercer hunger for strength.

“What are you all standing around for? Break this barrier!” Zhang Ao, seeing his subordinates dying in droves, flew into a rage and bellowed.

Awakened by his shout, the Poxuan Palace experts snapped back to their senses, unleashing killing moves and summoning Secret Treasures to bombard the barrier.

War Soul Hall’s Cao Guan also jolted awake. Casting aside his shock, he hurried to add his strength.

Yang Kai laughed wildly, standing alone at the edge of the barrier as he unleashed one Nine Heavens Divine Technique after another.

One peak after another formed a wondrous link with him, amplifying his killing moves several times over.

Exhilarating!

Yang Kai had never experienced such an exhilarating eruption of power. He could clearly feel just how terrifying his attacks became after the amplification.

They were roughly comparable to the blows of a Second Stage Saint Realm cultivator.

With all pretense torn, Yang Kai no longer held back and went all out.

After the Profound Heaven Sword and the Heaven-Covering Palm, the Heaven‑Slaying Spear, the Heaven‑Encompassing Net, and the Nether Heaven Lock all shone in dazzling succession.

He also used the Vast Heaven Shield—condensed from a few drops of Yang Liquid essence—which spread across the outside of the barrier. After being amplified by the Nine Peaks, the great golden shield became like an indestructible bulwark: no matter how those experts attacked, it remained impregnable.

Yang Kai alone stood against all the warriors of Poxuan Palace and War Soul Hall. Not only was he not the least bit flustered, he even moved with ease.

Xu Hui and the others watched, dumbfounded.

They had, in truth, been uneasy, unsure whether they could weather the current crisis. But seeing the new Saint Lord perform so brilliantly, each set down the stone in his heart and, like spectators at a play, simply stood behind Yang Kai—neither acting nor speaking—like bodyguards, looking almost bored.

Zhang Ao roared again and again, truly incensed. With a flourish of his hand, he flung out a handkerchief‑like Secret Treasure. Lifelike depictions of exotic beasts were embroidered upon it; no one knew what material it was woven from. Five‑colored light flowed, hazy and resplendent.

True Yuan poured into it; as it fluttered, the handkerchief swelled until it grew incomparably huge and instantly draped over the barrier.

The embroidered beasts seemed to come alive, charging through the barrier’s confinement without obstruction. In midair they lashed their tails, turning into razor‑sharp attacks that blasted toward Yang Kai.

At the same time, War Soul Hall’s Cao Guan also summoned a longsword, which abruptly became a beam of light. Trailing the beasts, it pierced the barrier’s blockade and, carrying the breath of death, thrust straight at the point between Yang Kai’s brows.

The other experts of these two forces, as well as a few hotheads who had jumped into the fight, were all worked up. True Yuan surged in their hands as they sent countless killing moves at Yang Kai in concert.

Joining forces, these experts tried to kill Yang Kai in one fell swoop.

In their eyes, Yang Kai had become the most dangerous figure. As long as they could slay him, then breaking the barrier and annihilating Nine Heavens Sacred Land would be easy.

The barrier’s formation and subtleties were all related to this new Saint Lord. Clearly, if this Saint Lord met with mishap, Xu Hui and the others wouldn’t be able to hold out.

And indeed, without Yang Kai, Nine Heavens Sacred Land wouldn’t last long.

The beasts’ roars shook the heavens, and the attacks that followed them were each formidable—methods unleashed by Saint Realm and Transcendent Realm experts—sweeping in like a sky‑filling deluge.

Yet Yang Kai showed no fear; he didn’t even think of dodging.

The Xu Hui group who had been standing behind him moved at last. True Yuan surged within them and poured out like a tide, merging together into a boundless sea to meet the various killing moves hurtling toward Yang Kai.

A massive cluster of light exploded. Just a few zhang before Yang Kai, it burst like fireworks, scattering multicolored streamers.

When everyone came back to their senses, their hearts sank a notch.

Yang Kai stood where he was, entirely unscathed. By contrast, the killing moves he unleashed once more swept toward the crowd like Death’s scythe.

“With just this meager ability, you dare to come attack my Nine Heavens Sacred Land? Have you not yet woken from your dreams?” Yang Kai sneered coldly, his words laced with mockery and thorns.  

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan’s faces alternated between green and white. They wanted to retort but had no answer; it was a thoroughly humiliating sight.

“Brat, don’t think you’re so capable. If you weren’t borrowing the might of the Nine Peaks, you’re nothing!” Cao Guan roared, his face full of unwillingness.

He truly didn’t take Yang Kai’s real cultivation seriously, but hiding within the barrier and borrowing the Nine Peaks’ power to oppose them made him extremely troublesome.
