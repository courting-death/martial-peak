## Chapter 1589 — Good Tactic

The red‑haired elder snorted coldly, his face full of displeasure. “A single human isn’t worth such a fuss, but Chi Yue, are you mistaken? This time we’re sending our yao sons to the Blood Prison — is he coming along to enter the Blood Prison as well?”

“In a manner of speaking.” Chi Yue nodded lightly.

The red‑haired elder’s expression darkened into anger, while the burly man likewise wore a severe look and demanded, “Why was this sort of thing not told to Kuang Shi and me?”

“It’s just a trivial matter—nothing worth troubling you two over,” Chi Yue said casually. “This little one is an old acquaintance of my Qingluo. He’s merely passing through my Space Array to reach Cuiwei Star. There’s no need for you to concern yourselves.”

The burly man frowned and stared at Chi Yue intently, his voice low: “Chi Yue, what are you up to?”

“What could I possibly be up to? Can’t you see he’s only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm? This kid is overestimating himself, leering at my Qingluo because they’re acquainted, imagining a toad eating swan meat. I agreed with him that if he could safely leave the Blood Prison, he could pursue Qingluo — if he insists on courting death, who am I to stop him? There — are you satisfied with that explanation?”

The red‑haired elder and the burly man exchanged a glance; neither wholly believed Chi Yue’s words, but neither dared to press the matter further.

The Space Array that leads to the Blood Prison was formed tens of thousands of years ago by the previous generation's Red Moon Domain's Lady; it belongs to Red Moon Domain. That she could open it and allow new talents from other territories to pass through counted as great benevolence.

Chi Yue already held full dominion over that Space Array!

If they continued to quarrel, it might cost more than it was worth. If Chi Yue, in anger, refused in the future to let outsiders pass, then newcomers from other territories would miss the Blood Prison Trial.

“This brat is unbearably cocky!” the red‑haired elder sneered at Yang Kai. “He dares speak so brazenly. If he truly wants to die, then I have no objection — but Chi Yue, if this happens again, do inform me beforehand!”

“Indeed.” The burly man nodded in agreement.

Chi Yue let out a charming laugh. “This time, it was a bit careless of me. Mm, I promise there won’t be a next time.”

Hearing her say that, the red‑haired elder and the burly man had nothing more to say; they chose to turn a blind eye and pretend they had seen nothing.

“Qingluo, come and pay respects to Senior Kuang Shi and Senior Nu Xie. These two are renowned figures on Di Chen Star.” Chi Yue waved to Shan Qingluo.

Shan Qingluo replied and hurried forward to bow.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly; he immediately realized these two Void King Realm experts were likely the Lord Kuang Shi and the Lord Nu Xie, though he couldn’t fathom why they had appeared here.

While he pondered, a resentful gaze came from the side. Yang Kai turned and saw Xue Lian looking his way. Yang Kai grinned; Xue Lian’s face twitched as he recalled the unpleasant struggles with Yang Kai in days past.

That battle had shattered his pride utterly.

“Yang Kai, over here!” Ba He called out with warm enthusiasm.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and took the chair beside him.

A few days ago, Ba He went to the pavilion to request the Little Senior Sister refine pills; the result pleased him greatly — the medicinal ingredients he had painstakingly gathered were not wasted, and under Xia Ningshang’s skilled hands the medicine was successfully formed.

He felt much gratitude toward Xia Ningshang, and that affection extended to Yang Kai as well.

“Yang Kai, be careful on this Blood Prison trip. Those inside will generally be a stage higher than you; don’t be too arrogant.” Ba He warned softly.

“This junior's always humble,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Ba He couldn’t help but roll his eyes.

“By the way, who are those two?” Yang Kai asked, glancing at the two yao newcomers he had not yet met.

Ba He naturally had no reason to hide it and introduced them in a low voice.

Of the two, the voluptuous woman was named Xue Sun, hailing from the Fierce Crab Territory—apparently one of that territory’s lord’s trusted subordinates. The bright and spirited young man beside her was called Lie Feng, from the Mad Lion Territory, likewise a key aide under Lord Kuang Shi.

Lord Nu Xie and Lord Kuang Shi had no proper heirs, so they could only send their best retainers to participate in the Blood Prison Trial. Both Xue Sun and Lie Feng were famous in their respective territories.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and committed their names to memory.

The two yao experts seemed interested in Yang Kai as well, stealing looks at him from time to time; when their gazes met, Lie Feng even offered Yang Kai a friendly smile.

This fellow should be easy to get along with, Yang Kai thought to himself.

The great hall fell silent; time passed slowly as everyone closed their eyes to cultivate and wait.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense flowed through the great hall’s Great Space Array, probing for its secrets. He suddenly noticed the array’s arrangement bore some resemblance to the altar that linked Di Chen and the Spider Mother’s Nest — whether there was a connection, he did not know.

At a certain moment one day later, Chi Yue and the two other lord‑level experts simultaneously opened their eyes, brilliance flashing from within.

“Begin!” Lord Kuang Shi shouted in a low voice.

The eight Origin Returning Realm cultivators waiting to depart all trembled slightly in spirit and rose to their feet in unison.

The three yao lords moved to the edge of the Great Space Array, taking positions like the points of a triangle, their expressions solemn.

“Start!” Chi Yue’s voice, delicate yet commanding, cried out as she formed complex and intricate hand seals.

Nu Xie and Kuang Shi followed suit. As their seals took shape, terrifying surges of power began to settle within the three lords’ bodies.

The Origin Returning Realm warriors in the hall watched in awe, secretly longing to one day command such force with only a gesture.

Chi Yue, Nu Xie, Kuang Shi, with Saint Yuan surging, poured madness and might into the Space Array as if they were giving their all.

The array hummed; the Saint Crystals embedded within flared, transforming the hall into blazing daylight that made eyes water.

“Everyone, Cuiwei Star is far from Di Chen Star. This Great Space Array will guarantee your entry into the Blood Prison, but not your landing point — so be cautious.” Chi Yue’s voice carried on. “Those who enter the Blood Prison are all formidable. Inside, avoid conflict when possible; focus on comprehending Domain mysteries and seeking Domain Stones. I hope you all go and return together!”

“Did everyone hear that?” Kuang Shi roared when the crowd showed little reaction.

“We heard!” The yao newcomers shivered with spirit and answered in unison.

Kuang Shi showed a satisfied expression.

“I have little else to advise.” Nu Xie chuckled and said succinctly, “Return alive, and the future of Di Chen will have a place for you!”

“We will heed the three seniors’ teachings!”

At that moment the entire palace trembled as the Great Space Array emitted a cataclysmic fluctuation, and a pillar of pure white light shot up to the clouds.

Even from ten million li away one could clearly see that white pillar.

The trembling gradually subsided, and the pillar of pure white light slowly dissipated into nothingness. In the end, upon the Great Space Array, an oval-shaped gateway of energy appeared before everyone’s eyes.

“Depart!” Chi Yue’s expression was solemn as she called.

Ba He led the way, gave Chi Yue a slight nod, and without looking back rushed into the oval gateway, vanishing in an instant.

One figure after another followed Ba He, surging into the gate.

Yang Kai was too lazy to scramble with others and walked last. As he stepped onto the Space Array and was about to disappear, he suddenly flashed a grin at Chi Yue and waved, “Farewell for now, Senior Chi Yue — we shall meet again!”

Chi Yue’s pretty face stiffened, her brow knitting.

Before she could say anything, Yang Kai had already vanished.

“This human brat is truly arrogant beyond measure!” Kuang Shi let out a cold snort.

“Close the array first,” Nu Xie urged, “lest the commotion draw that fellow on Cuiwei Star’s attention.”

Chi Yue did not respond. Her expression shifted as if she perceived something; a tide of Divine Sense suddenly spilled forth and swept toward the attic where Xia Ningshang had been.

The next instant Chi Yue’s pretty face twisted; she ground her teeth and hissed, “You little bastard — you dared do this to me!”

Upon sensing Xia Ningshang was not in the imperial residence, Chi Yue immediately realized what trick Yang Kai was playing.

He had no intention of returning to Di Chen — not anymore.

She had thought that by holding Master Xia in her grasp, she could toy with that human boy as she pleased—yet unexpectedly, the other still proved to be a move ahead.

But Chi Yue could not fathom how Yang Kai had made Xia Ningshang vanish so suddenly, nor where he had hidden her.

When she had previously probed, the woman surnamed Xia had still been in the attic; why had she suddenly disappeared?

“Chi Yue, what are you doing?” Nu Xie and Kuang Shi both looked at her in puzzlement, not understanding why she had burst into such fury.

“Nothing.” Chi Yue shook her head and took a deep breath. “Close the array first.”

Being bested by a human at only the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — Chi Yue could not bring herself to speak that fact aloud; if she did, Nu Xie and Kuang Shi would surely mock her.

She would never expose such humiliation.

That brat has fine moves — no wonder he had insisted she hand the half of the Yao Transformation Technique to Yu Xiong for safekeeping; he clearly had plans all along.

Qingluo — would she have left with him as well? The thought threw Chi Yue into turmoil and her face darkened.

If Yang Kai had indeed acquired the Void Mind Crystal and struck a deal with Yu Xiong, she would not be at a loss. But if he used sweet words to spirit Qingluo away, where in this vast Star Domain could she possibly search?

If that truly occurred, she would hunt him down to the ends of the sky and sea and take his head! Chi Yue swore inwardly.
