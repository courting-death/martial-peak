## Chapter 1248 — Ten-Thousand-Year Incense

His Divine Sense cultivation had become exceedingly powerful; the crystal capable of inducing hallucinations in him was naturally no ordinary object, and it was very likely connected to the earlier illusion array.

This thing might very well be the array’s eye, and the Artifact Spirit had brought the crystal back in its beak, causing the previous illusion array to collapse on its own. The more Yang Kai thought about it, the more it made sense, and he felt a keen interest in the crystal; after steeling his mind, he regarded it with utmost caution.

This time, however, no black vapor flowed forth; instead, after glancing at it Yang Kai suddenly felt his Sea of Consciousness churn, then his head swam and his vision blurred as if his whole body lost weight and floated, the world turning topsy-turvy.

Yang Kai’s heart jolted; he hastily withdrew his gaze, closed his eyes, and after a while recovered.

Not daring to casually pry into the strange crystal any further, Yang Kai beckoned to the Artifact Spirit and had it deliver the crystal into his Spatial Ring, planning to study it thoroughly after returning.

The Artifact Spirit saw that he had finally returned to normal and ceased its chatter, flying back to Yang Kai’s shoulder to preen its plumage with an elegant air.

Only then did Yang Kai begin to scrutinize the Sixth Layer carefully.

At first glance he could not help but be greatly surprised.

He discovered that the space of this Sixth Layer was pitifully small, only a few dozen li across; the Fifth Layer Heat-Flame Zone encircled it, and Yang Kai could take in the entire Sixth Layer with a single look.

Within the Sixth Layer the Spiritual Qi was thick, and a few li ahead there stood a grove of verdant bamboo; each slender stalk was vividly green and swayed with the wind.

At the center of the bamboo grove there appeared to be a pavilion; no one knew how long it had stood there, but despite countless ages of erosion it remained erect.

The whole Sixth Layer was encased within the Fifth Layer yet seemed unaffected by the Fifth Layer’s heat waves as if it were a world unto itself — wondrous indeed.

Yang Kai fixed his mind on the bamboo grove and the delicate pavilion within, his thoughts in turmoil.

Although he had seen the ruins of a great sect back in the Fourth Layer and knew that the Flowing Flame Sandland had once been inhabited, encountering such a pavilion here still astonished him.

The Spiritual Qi here was even denser than where the sect ruins lay; the pavilion was clearly not meant for ordinary people and was very likely the dwelling of a high-ranking figure from that sect.

Moreover, it was highly likely that the master here had been a woman, for the surroundings exuded a refined elegance that no male cultivator would ever pay such attention to.

Drawing a deep breath, Yang Kai maintained his World-Ending Demon Eye and strode slowly toward it.

Having come this far, there was no reason to shrink back; he wanted to see what treasure the pavilion held, and the bamboo here, able to grow in such conditions, could not be ordinary.

He had initially worried the place might be filled with forbidden arrays, but after casually walking several laps through the bamboo grove without encountering danger he was surprised and chastised himself for being overly cautious.

Still, he did not let down his guard; standing within the grove he condensed a Demonic Flame longsword in his hand and targeted a bamboo stalk only as thick as his thumb and several zhang tall, swinging his sword down.

Each stalk glowed with vibrant green and brimmed with Spiritual Qi, clearly not ordinary bamboo — excellent material for forging. In such a grove there were at least a few thousand stalks, and Yang Kai intended to cut some to bring back for Yang Flame to craft secret treasures.

When he struck, something unexpected happened: the bamboo at the slice point remained unharmed, not even a scratch.

Yang Kai’s face fell; he realized he had underestimated the bamboo, but simultaneously rejoiced — such tenacity meant it would indeed make superb forging material.

He therefore continued swinging his sword to chop at it.

Half an hour later Yang Kai stood where he had been, his face ashen as he glared at the bamboo with a sour expression.

In that half hour he had used nearly every method available, yet could not fell a single stalk. Even after unleashing Space Blade dozens of times he only managed to leave a tiny, nearly negligible nick at the root.

At that rate, taking down one bamboo stalk would require no less than a dozen days.

Yang Kai had neither the time nor the patience to waste; with a reluctant final glance he sighed and abandoned the idea, turning instead toward the pavilion.

Best to first see whether the pavilion held anything of value.

Before long Yang Kai arrived at the pavilion and did not rush inside; he stood and craned his neck to inspect this structure that had stood for tens of thousands of years.

Its style differed slightly from modern pavilions, but overall it was not so different and was exceptionally well preserved. Whatever materials had been used, the main door was shut and showed no trace of dust.

The pavilion had three floors, each roughly two to three zhang high, capped by a semicircular roof that did not seem out of place.

After hesitating a moment, Yang Kai looked to the Artifact Spirit still perched on his shoulder. The Artifact Spirit, eyes narrowed, was fixated on the pavilion as if trying to discern something; noticing Yang Kai’s gaze, it sensed danger, flickered, transformed into a streak of fire, and dove into Yang Kai’s refining furnace within his arms, refusing to come out.

Worthless! Yang Kai cursed inwardly. He had hoped the Artifact Spirit would enter first to scout, but it proved cunning; sensing his intent it immediately shrank into its container.

Yang Kai had no intention of forcing it — after all, it had helped him dismantle the illusion array earlier and had yielded that unknown crystal.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai strode forward to the pavilion and pushed open the main door.

With a creak the door opened.

Yang Kai’s face grew serious as he quietly stimulated his Saint Yuan, remaining on high alert.

Yet when the door was fully opened there was no sense of danger; instead a clear, calming fragrance wafted from within, making Yang Kai feel refreshed and invigorated.

Following the scent, Yang Kai’s brows lifted as he hurried to a small platform and marveled at a tiny incense burner.

The burner resembled a miniaturized refining furnace of no low grade, radiating notable Spiritual Qi fluctuations. It was clearly a Void King-Grade Lower-Level incense burner, though such burners rarely had combat functions and were usually ornamental.

That a mere ornament was of Void King-Grade Lower-Level meant this pavilion was extraordinary.

What astonished Yang Kai was not the little burner itself but the thumb-sized sandalwood burning within it, veins of purple radiance flowing across it. The drifting aroma was formless and invisible to the naked eye, yet Yang Kai could sense it; this fragrance greatly benefited a warrior’s cultivation and could swiftly usher anyone into an optimal training state.

"Ten-thousand-year incense?" Yang Kai pondered, then spoke the name aloud, his expression brightening.

Though he had not immediately recognized the purple sandalwood’s origin, after observing it a while Yang Kai guessed its nature; if it truly was Ten-thousand-Year Incense, then this item was a treasure.

Ten-thousand-Year Incense can burn for ten thousand years without extinguishing, and this thumb-sized piece had already burned for tens of thousands of years yet still remained that large — a clear indicator of its supreme quality; it was very likely top-grade Ten-thousand-Year Incense.

Ten-thousand-Year Incense is not naturally formed but a crafted product, and producing it requires a dozen or so materials from Tenth-Tier demonic beasts. Among these, the rarest is an aromatic sac from the Seven-Colored Elk.

The Seven-Colored Elk is a remnant of ancient demonic beasts, born at Eighth-Tier and reaching Tenth-Tier upon maturity. It is exceedingly rare and astonishingly powerful; its seven-hued radiance can ignore all defenses — even a Void King Realm expert would recoil three steps.

To slay a Seven-Colored Elk requires at least three to five Void Kings of Second Stage or higher working together, or even stronger combatants.

Once the aromatic sac is removed, it must be refined within ten days, otherwise the scent disperses and is lost.

Hence Ten-thousand-Year Incense is so precious. Its usefulness is not limited to helping a warrior rapidly reach peak training state; inhaling the fragrance while cultivating also raises the chances of Enlightenment and calms the heart, suppressing inner demons.

When a warrior breaks a major realm, they must not only gain insight into the Martial and Heavenly Dao and have matching mental cultivation, they may also face unexpected inner demons — these demons are the hidden pains or regrets buried deep in a warrior’s heart, normally suppressed but liable to surface silently at the crucial moment and affect their advancement.

It is commonplace for warriors to perish or be grievously wounded under the assault of their inner demons.

Yang Kai had so far encountered no such inner demons, for he harbored few lingering regrets or pains; only the long separation from the women he loved weighed on him, though he remained confident of reunion and so had not faced these difficulties.

Still, one could not be sure what future events might ignite lingering obsessions; if such things erupted during a major breakthrough, the consequences would be dire.

Having a piece of Ten-thousand-Year Incense like this would solve those problems.

He recognized the incense partly because of his knowledge of alchemy; This ten-thousand-Year Incense must have been crafted by an alchemist.
