## Chapter 168 — Unexpected Changes

These martial artists bore the responsibility of protection and could not afford to be careless.

The only remaining explanation was that they had been drugged and were unable to act of their own volition!

Recalling the middle-aged man's attitude during dinner and the momentary relaxation in his expression, Yang Kai began to understand.

In his eyes, he was merely an ordinary little beggar. The food served at dinner must have been drugged; if he had consumed it like the others, he would surely have been knocked out in no time, for an ordinary person's resistance could not possibly match that of a martial artist.

Once he fell unconscious, it would inevitably raise suspicion.

Although this was not the case, it was undoubtedly the middle-aged man's concern, which was why he had threatened Yang Kai fiercely, preventing him from eating dinner. After Yang Kai turned to leave, the man had finally relaxed.

One must guard against both day and night, but what was the middle-aged man after? Wealth or beauty, or something else?

Yang Kai hoped his speculation was wrong. The young lady had a kind heart, and Cui’er had treated him well; good people should receive their just rewards!

However, when he quietly glanced towards the gathering of martial artists, his heart sank.

By the flickering bonfire, several figures were stealthily rising, slowly drawing the blades from their waists, and slashing at the necks of their companions who had shared meals and lodgings with them, now unconscious.

A faint sound echoed, and blood splattered.

Silently, several lives returned to the netherworld!

Yang Kai dared not move. Although he had already advanced to the Qi Movement Realm, there were many of these thieves, and the middle-aged man was a true essence master. Acting rashly would only lead to his own demise.

Moreover, he did not know if there were more thieves hidden among the crowd.

Was Old Wu one of them? If so, with Old Wu's abilities, everyone would be doomed.

Squinting towards the carriage where Old Wu was, Yang Kai felt a moment of relief, only to become tense again.

He saw the middle-aged man, now cold and vigilant, stealthily approaching Old Wu, his footsteps silent, his aura reined in to the utmost. The long sword in his hand lay flat beside him, reflecting no light in the dark night.

Old Wu was not one of them! But at this moment, his life was equally threatened.

Yang Kai's mind raced, and he quietly reached down to pick up a small stone from the ground. He flicked it with his fingertip, sending it flying.

He intended to hit Old Wu, hoping to wake him up. But fearing the exposure of his own aura, he did not dare to use too much energy, causing the stone to veer off course and strike the middle-aged man's sword instead.

“Clang…” A clear sound of the sword echoed, startlingly out of place in this silent night of murder.

The middle-aged man clearly did not expect such a turn of events. The moment the sound rang out, his expression turned cold. Without hesitation, he shook his sword and lunged at Old Wu.

In this critical moment, Old Wu opened his bleary eyes and instinctively dodged to the side.

A spray of blood erupted as Old Wu's shoulder was pierced, the pain jolting him awake. He swung the horsewhip in his hand, creating a crisp crack as it struck towards the middle-aged man, shouting angrily, “Zhang Ding, what are you doing!”

Zhang Ding did not answer, retracting his long sword with a grim expression, engaging Old Wu in a fierce battle.

Yang Kai quietly surveyed his surroundings and found that the previously sleeping martial artists had all been awakened. He could not help but breathe a sigh of relief; it seemed that Zhang Ding had been cautious when drugging them, not daring to use a deadly poison or a too potent sleeping drug.

After all, such drugs, if too potent, would easily be detected.

However, his caution was completely undone by the sound of the sword ringing out.

Had it not been for that sound, all present would have been silently killed by Zhang Ding and his subordinates.

Once the sleeping martial artists were awakened, they looked around in confusion, some unable to grasp the situation.

Before long, a cry rang out: “Sun Jianming is dead! Who did it?”

Before the words had even left his mouth, the person felt a chill in his chest, looking down to see a sword piercing through him.

“Diao Hong, what are you doing?”

The shout was mixed with disbelief.

In such a situation, the most feared thing was being stabbed in the back by a trusted companion. Just moments after awakening, several of the martial artists were swiftly dealt with by Zhang Ding's subordinates. Only then did they realize, screaming in rage, they fought back with unparalleled fury.

The battlefield split into two groups: one was a chaotic melee of the minions, and the other was a fierce duel between Zhang Ding and Old Wu, filled with curses, anger, and relentless questioning.

At this moment, Yang Kai was quietly making his way towards the third carriage under the cover of darkness.

He had initially intended to flee, which was the safest option. However, recalling Cui’er’s care for him these past few days, he found it hard to abandon her.

The three women inside the carriage had evidently been startled awake by the commotion outside. As Yang Kai approached, he heard Cui’er’s dissatisfied voice from within: “What’s all this noise in the middle of the night?”

Followed by the sound of rustling as she got dressed.

Yang Kai did not hesitate, lifting the curtain of the carriage and slipping inside.

“Who is it!” Cui’er exclaimed in shock, raising her small fists to strike at him.

“Don’t hit! It’s me!” Yang Kai grasped her hands tightly.

“Little beggar?” Cui’er finally recognized his voice, then gritted her teeth and said, “You lecher, get out!”

As she spoke, she kicked at him. Inside the carriage, the lady and the young miss were also frightened by Yang Kai's sudden appearance, trembling like quails in the cold winter.

“Be quiet!” Yang Kai covered her mouth, pressing her down onto the carriage floor.

Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly swallowed hard.

Close at hand, he could clearly see that Cui’er was only wearing a form-fitting undergarment, her outer clothing still disheveled, revealing an abundance of spring scenery.

“Zhang Ding has turned against us! Listen for yourselves!” Yang Kai hurriedly said.

This was directed at the three women in the carriage, as it was indeed a bit abrupt for him to barge in at such a late hour, and he needed to explain the situation. He glanced at the lady and the young miss, then quickly averted his gaze.

He discovered that these three women were quite bold. They had only stripped down to their undergarments while sleeping in the carriage at night. The young miss was somewhat better off, but the lady had even less clothing than Cui’er. Although the light was dim, Yang Kai’s vision was extraordinary, and he saw everything that should and should not be seen.

The three women in the carriage were momentarily stunned, listening carefully, and indeed heard Old Wu scolding Zhang Ding, interspersed with Zhang Ding's cold laughter.

“How could this happen?” Cui’er was dumbfounded.

The lady and the young miss were now holding blankets in front of themselves, their faces pale.

“Quickly put on your clothes. I’ll take you out of here.” Yang Kai gritted his teeth; he did not know how much longer Old Wu and the martial artists could hold on, nor who would emerge victorious in this battle. But they absolutely could not remain in the carriage any longer.

Yang Kai's calm demeanor slightly infected the three women. Hearing his words, they remembered what they should do at this moment.

The lady's face flushed. She trembled as she said, “Little beggar, could you please step out first while we get dressed…”

Yang Kai turned to glance at her, somewhat impatiently saying, “Madam, if you wish to live, do not hesitate too much. If I step out now, it will only expose our whereabouts.”

Upon hearing this, the lady nodded slightly.

The three women hurriedly began to dress in the carriage. Although Yang Kai had his back turned to them, the lady and the young miss still blushed deeply. The two of them were dressing in front of a man, something they had never dared to imagine before, but now, forced by the situation, they could only suppress their embarrassment.

Cui’er was somewhat better; she was more open-minded and familiar with Yang Kai. Before long, she was fully dressed and went to help the lady and the young miss.

In no time, the three women had finished dressing.

“Let’s hurry and escape.” Cui’er's voice trembled slightly.

Just as Yang Kai was about to lift the curtain of the carriage, his movements paused, and his expression darkened: “There’s no time!”

Before his words had even finished, Old Wu's scream rang out. Moments later, the sounds of battle outside gradually ceased.

Old Wu and the martial artists who were guarding them had clearly failed. Under the effects of the drug, Old Wu and his companions could not exert their full strength, and Zhang Ding and his subordinates had launched a surprise attack. Even though they were outnumbered, they held the advantage.

“Cough, cough, old fool!” A weak cough came from outside, unmistakably the voice of the middle-aged man, Zhang Ding, who had evidently sustained injuries in his fight with Old Wu.

This cough gave Yang Kai a glimmer of hope for survival.

“What do we do? What do we do?” Cui’er clutched Yang Kai tightly, her voice trembling with a hint of tears, while the lady and the young miss looked at him with anxious eyes.

At this moment, the boy whom the three women had deemed a little beggar had become their last hope.

“Everyone, don’t panic. Madam, you distract him with words, and I’ll find an opportunity to strike.” Yang Kai whispered, taking a deep breath, holding his breath, and suppressing his heartbeat.

The lady was still the lady; despite facing danger, her face was pale, but upon hearing Yang Kai's words, she nodded, unlike Cui’er and the young miss, who had already lost their composure.

The sound of footsteps approached from outside, and Yang Kai listened carefully, deducing that there were still five of them left.

As the footsteps drew closer, Cui’er moved even closer to Yang Kai, her delicate body trembling. In this pitch-black night, the approaching footsteps sounded like the footsteps of a vengeful ghost, causing panic in her heart.

The footsteps finally stopped outside the carriage.

Zhang Ding coughed again, his voice weak: “Madam, young miss, please come out of the carriage.”

The lady took a deep breath, her voice trembling as she said, “Zhang Ding, my husband treated you like a brother in life; why are you doing this?”

It was clear that the lady’s questioning was filled with heartache, as she had not expected Zhang Ding to be so resolute.

There was a long silence outside, and after a while, Zhang Ding replied, “Madam, please understand. People die for wealth, and birds die for food. Your husband has passed, yet he left behind such a vast estate. You and the young miss are powerless; how can you protect it?”

“Is it just for wealth?” the lady laughed bitterly, questioning further, “What about the others? Do they think the same?”

Zhang Ding replied, “Indeed.”

The lady sighed repeatedly, “If that’s the case, then take the wealth and leave. Zhang Ding, if you still remember our past friendship, please spare my daughter and me. We only wish to live today, nothing more.”

The lady’s words clearly indicated that she did not place all her hopes on Yang Kai. Although he appeared calm, in her eyes, he was merely a little beggar; how could he withstand the formidable Zhang Ding?
