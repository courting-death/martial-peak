## Chapter 1498 — Shocking the World

The instant Yang Kai made his move, that middle-aged woman felt something was wrong.

The black arrow hurtling from the opposite side could actually rival the full-strength strike of a warrior at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

Are you kidding me! Even with the might of a Secret Treasure, a cultivator could not unleash an attack vastly beyond his own realm. That short, black arrow had already exceeded the scope of the middle-aged woman's understanding.

Could that actually be a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure? As this thought arose, the woman's expression changed drastically and she couldn't help but cry out.

"Be careful!"

"Junior Sister Zhou, dodge!"

Shouts came from all directions. As a member of the Battle Sky Alliance—and a woman besides—this woman surnamed Zhou clearly had some connections. Seeing her mired in danger at this moment, some immediately cried warnings.

Others had already sped over, trying to lend her a hand.

How could the woman surnamed Zhou not want to evade? The moment she sensed the tremendous lethality hidden in that black arrow, she realized things were bad. But the speed of that short, black arrow was unfathomable; she had no time to dodge at all.

In what seemed only a blink, the pitch-black arrow was already upon her, first touching the defense formed by that blue gauze veil.

Soundlessly, the protective Secret Treasure she relied upon was pierced through in an instant, unable to display any effect. The black arrow, like a hot knife through tallow, swept through and smashed all resistance, unstoppable. After puncturing the blue-gauze defense, it effortlessly bored through the Saint Yuan guarding her body.

Whoosh…

A streak of black radiance shot out from the back of that middle-aged woman and vanished in the blink of an eye.

The expert who had rushed to rescue her halted in midair, mouth agape, staring in stupefaction at her chest and abdomen, his face filled with utter horror.

The woman surnamed Zhou seemed to realize something was amiss; following his gaze downward, her face turned ashen on the spot.

She saw a bowl-sized hole in her chest and belly. From this side one could see clearly through to the other, and could even vaguely glimpse a beating heart.

Strangely, not the slightest drop of fresh blood flowed from the wound.

"Alliance Master… save me!" The woman surnamed Zhou's face instantly collapsed. She stretched out a hand toward where Qu Zheng stood, as if trying to seize her last chance at life.

It was only futile.

As soon as the words fell, a mass of black Demonic Flame ignited from her wound. A miserable scream rang out and quickly ceased. Wrapped in the Demonic Flame, the woman surnamed Zhou was burned to nothing!

A chorus of sharp inhalations rose from all around.

If Yang Kai's instant execution of Qu Changfeng just now still carried a hint of sneak attack, then killing this woman surnamed Zhou in one move was done head-on. Moreover, before he acted, he had even spoken to warn her, giving her ample time to put up a defense.

Even so, it was still a single exchange and she was slain!

No one dared underestimate Yang Kai in the slightest anymore; all the gazes fixed on him had changed, turning into fear and dread.

With the cultivation of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, to instant-kill someone at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—this was simply unbelievable. Perhaps the Alliance Master could accomplish this if he went all out. Could it be that this brat's strength already rivaled the Alliance Master?

And that stubby, arrow-like Secret Treasure—what in the world was that thing, to possess such terrifying might?

Outside the palace, not a sound could be heard; nearly everyone was sunk in shock.

Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction. Though he had long known that the Feather Spirit Arrow's power was anything but ordinary, he had not expected it to be strong to this degree. It was just a pity that using it came with great restrictions: it had to be charged beforehand, and even when fully charged, it could only be used twice.

"What are you all still standing around for? Don't let him pick you off one by one. He's only one man—what are you afraid of? What he relies on is merely the might of a Secret Treasure!" Fang Peng suddenly barked harshly, sneering again and again. "If this old man's guess is right, his various methods are all greatly limited, and the number of times he can use them is absolutely not many. Has that already scared your guts to pieces? Surround him for me. This old man wants to see whether he truly has three heads and six arms!"

Indeed, the older the ginger, the spicier it is. As Sect Master of the Leitai Sect and a hegemon of a region, Fang Peng's eye for battle was far beyond that of ordinary cultivators. Although he only half understood the Blooming Lotus secret art and the Feather Spirit Arrow, he had, at least, struck the heart of the matter.

As for the Feather Spirit Arrow, it went without saying—at most it could be used twice in a single battle.

And the Blooming Lotus secret art, when performed, imposed a tremendous burden even on someone with Yang Kai's strength of Divine Sense.

At his peak, using it three to five times would dry up his Sea of Consciousness.

The reason he slew two enemies in an instant at the outset was intimidation! The enemy count was too great. Though he did not fear them, without doing something, it would indeed be troublesome.

But the deaths of Qu Changfeng and that middle-aged woman could exert enormous psychological pressure on them. In a clash between masters, you matched cultivation, matched realm, matched secret arts and Secret Treasures—and even more, you matched heart.

With an unsteady heart, one could not bring out one's full strength.

Half his stratagem had succeeded, but it fell just short; at the final moment, Fang Peng laid it bare.

One word to wake a dreamer.

Hearing Fang Peng's shout, everyone quickly came to their senses. Thinking it through, it was indeed so. No matter how strong a single person was, there was a limit—what was more, Yang Kai was merely of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

If he were truly that formidable, why did he choose to kill Qu Changfeng and the woman surnamed Zhou? One was First Stage, the other Second Stage.

If his means truly defied the heavens, why not directly kill Qu Zheng and Fang Peng?

He only picked soft persimmons to squeeze—clearly he was just playing tricks.

With that thought, the momentum of the assembled experts surged. No longer timid as before, they each summoned their Secret Treasures and secret arts and blasted toward Yang Kai.

In an instant, lights of every hue blossomed. The place where Yang Kai stood became, in a blink, the nexus where energies converged—chaotic beyond compare.

Facing the attacks of more than twenty Origin Returning Realm experts, Yang Kai's face also darkened. He hastily summoned the Purple Shield, which transformed into a sandstorm that guarded his side and drowned out his figure.

At the same time, the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit shot out with a cry, jaws gaping, spewing basin-sized fireballs of searing heat that filled the sky and shot in all directions.

And that was not all. Dozens of Golden Blood Threads also lashed forth. Under Yang Kai's vast Divine Sense control, each one met a Secret Treasure or an incoming attack head-on.

The battle erupted in an instant.

Yang Kai fell into disadvantage. Dozens of Golden Blood Threads shuttled around him, their glow flickering. The Fire Bird Artifact Spirit was indeed formidable, yet two fists could not beat four hands; it was pounded into constant shrieks, its body shattering and reforming without end.

The sandstorm guarding his side was beaten to the point of scattering, nearly unable to cohere, about to expose Yang Kai's figure.

Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai held on bitterly; the situation was abysmally unfavorable.

Fang Peng stood off to the side without rushing to act. Seeing Yang Kai flounder left and right, he burst into loud laughter. "Boy, it's not too late to regret now. This old man can decide to spare your life, but suffering of the flesh is unavoidable. Who told you to kill Young Master Qu!"

His words were laced with gloating. Qu Changfeng had died miserably at Yang Kai's hands, which Fang Peng was naturally happy to see. Although they were temporarily allied with the Battle Sky Alliance, the two sides had deep rifts. With Qu Changfeng dead, the Battle Sky Alliance lost the most formidable figure among their younger generation, which would surely be detrimental to their future prospects.

If this continued, by the time the next generation fully matured, there would be no one left who could contend against Fang Tianzhong.

"Boom, boom, boom!"

The place where Yang Kai stood was battered by several Secret Treasures and torrents of energy. The sandstorm attached to the Purple Shield could no longer protect him fully; a gap burst open at once, exposing his figure.

Just then, the Great Elder of the Battle Sky Alliance, Mo Xiaosheng, appeared over there with eerie suddenness, his timing exquisitely precise.

Like Yang Kai, he too was a warrior who had cultivated Spatial Force, so his movements were naturally silent.

He lightly pushed out a palm, slipping through the shattered defense of the sandstorm to strike toward Yang Kai. Saint Yuan surged at the heart of that palm; its might was anything but ordinary.

Yang Kai snorted coldly and, with lightning speed, flipped his hand to meet it. When the two palms collided, two currents of Saint Yuan erupted at the center.

A muffled groan sounded. Mo Xiaosheng was blasted back a dozen zhang, and Yang Kai's figure also swayed, exposing even more openings.

To face head-on an expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—moreover, the Great Elder of the Battle Sky Alliance—and achieve this was already enough to be world-shocking. At the very least, Mo Xiaosheng's face showed shock; he could scarcely believe it.

Although his sneak attack had not injured Yang Kai, his goal had been achieved: Yang Kai had now completely exposed his openings, enough for the others to deal damage.

Everyone present was an Origin Returning Realm expert, their eyesight first-rate. None would miss the opening Mo Xiaosheng had created; they immediately urged their Saint Yuan and blasted toward Yang Kai.

Rattle, rattle…

The sandstorm utterly collapsed, and the Purple Shield surfaced—its radiance dim, its spirituality clearly greatly lost. Yang Kai's body was completely submerged beneath countless attacks.

Although the Purple Shield was an Upper-Level Origin-Grade Secret Treasure with extremely strong defense, it could not withstand the attacks of so many experts. From the moment Yang Kai summoned it until now, in less than ten breaths of time, it had already been broken.

Fang Peng frowned and hurriedly released his Divine Sense to probe the situation over there.

He did not want Yang Kai to die just like this. If that really happened, the Lingxiao Sect would absolutely not compromise, and there would be no way to force them to hand over the Void King-Grade warship.

But his concern was clearly unnecessary. Even after suffering such attacks, Yang Kai's vitality had not been severed, though his aura was somewhat disordered.

That was normal. If Yang Kai were still entirely unscathed, Fang Peng would have to consider whether he ought to retreat at once.

As the radiance dissipated, Yang Kai's figure was revealed. That miserable appearance entered everyone's eyes, and all of them were instantly roused!

Just moments ago, how domineering had Yang Kai been—he had not put anyone in his eyes and had slain two Origin Returning Realm cultivators with a wave of his hand. But now, it seemed, that was all…

The assembled experts' faces lit with joy, believing Yang Kai had run out of tricks.

Drip, drip…

A faint sound reached everyone’s ears — blood was dripping from Yang Kai’s body. Yet that blood was an eerie gold, and from it radiated an astonishing vitality and the overwhelming force of Qi and blood.
