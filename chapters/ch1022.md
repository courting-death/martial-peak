## Chapter 1022 — Fusion

At the foot of the mountain, people stood watching, their minds each occupied with different thoughts.

Inside the mountain's belly, Yang Kai felt the eruption of power within him, his face contorted in pain!

The greatest power a martial artist can possess is the limit that their physical body can endure; both the Transcendent Realm and the Saint Realm have their limits.

However, that limit had no effect on Yang Kai, for both his cultivation method and his body were unique.

The True Yang Technique caused the yang attribute energy in his body, once saturated, to transform into Yang Liquid and be stored in his Dantian, ready to be unleashed when needed.

The special nature of the Indomitable Golden Body could likewise house unimaginably terrifying might.

These were the two great reservoirs inside Yang Kai's body, incomparable to any other martial artist; it could be said that the amount of power he stored had no limit.

And now, Yang Kai opened both of those reservoirs.

The evil might hidden within the Indomitable Golden Body burst forth in an instant. To mitigate that malevolent influence on his will and flesh, Yang Kai simultaneously erupted drop after drop of Yang Liquid.

Evil energy and yang yuan violently collided from the two reservoirs, like a breached dam, threatening to engulf the entire peak.

The power was so great that even Yang Kai himself felt his heart tremble in fear; it far exceeded what his body should be able to bear — hundreds, even thousands of times beyond his body's capacity...

His flesh convulsed and writhed; blood raced beneath his skin. The immense power tore open his flesh inch by inch as golden blood flowed out, repeatedly healing his wounds only for the healed flesh to split open again in an endless cycle.

Yet Yang Kai's mood remained calm. He focused on sensing the two forces within him, comprehending their flow, discerning their patterns, and probing their essence.

Time passed slowly, and increasingly more evil energy and yang yuan dissipated and dissolved upon colliding.

As they dissolved, Yang Kai's understanding of the two forces deepened.

His Divine Sense spread like a tide, carefully feeling every anomaly. He had never imagined before that, when these two forces met, so many wondrous changes would occur.

Those surges of power seemed to acquire lives of their own, whispering secrets in Yang Kai's ear, wanting to reveal themselves. He saw flowers bloom and wither, tides rise and fall — cycle after cycle.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened, and confidence swelled in his heart.

He paid no heed to the collision and dissolution of the forces, maintaining the situation; he remained at the center of them, anchoring all his consciousness within the evil energy and yang yuan.

He was like an outsider, detached and silently observing everything.

After a long time, he suddenly experienced a subtle, wondrous sensation.

It seemed that only then had he truly grasped the crux of the powers, understanding their ultimate truths.

His expression shifted as he began to operate the Dual Cultivation Technique, using it as a foundation to guide the yang yuan and evil energy that had spilled outside his body to return.

His myriad pores opened wide; in an instant his body became a bottomless pit. The two escaping forces were drawn back and obediently returned.

On their way back they obeyed Yang Kai's command, no longer hostile or mutually destructive; instead they began to fuse, producing changes that filled him with joy.

Feeling these subtle changes, Yang Kai grew delighted and guided them with increasing effort.

At the foot of the mountain everyone was discussing whether Yang Kai would live or die, when suddenly He Miao cried out, "There’s a change."

Without her prompting, everyone sensed the shift in the atmosphere and turned their gaze toward the peak.

What they saw left them stunned and speechless.

Previously, the entire peak had been split in two by the two forces: one side shrouded in scorching power, dazzling with golden light, the other cloaked in boundless darkness.

But now everyone could feel the two forces slowly drawing toward each other, as if attracted; even when they rubbed together and fused, there was no conflict.

"It can’t really be happening, can it?" the Ghost Ancestor said with an odd expression as his Divine Sense probed the mountain; after a moment he smirked and scoffed, "This brat..."

He had clearly discovered the right method and grasped the secret of his power. If Yang Kai continued, he would truly be able to blend two utterly opposite forces together, just as the earlier jest had claimed.

The Ghost Ancestor found that he had underestimated Yang Kai and could not help feeling a trace of admiration and envy.

What he had said earlier was merely offhand advice, thinking Yang Kai could pursue that direction over decades or centuries, perhaps even longer.

—Provided he could live that long.

Who would have thought Yang Kai would achieve it in so little time.

This was not something done overnight; he must already have reached a certain depth of understanding beforehand, and the earlier jest became the key that opened the door to this power. Even if not now, with a little chance in the future he likely could have achieved what he did today.

Realizing this, the Ghost Ancestor could only laugh through his tears.

He had unwittingly given Yang Kai a push.

"Senior, is Yang Kai all right?" Shen Tu asked him, lifting his head.

"How would I know? Hmph!" The Ghost Ancestor frowned and strode away with a swish of his sleeve, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

"Then he must be fine," Shen Tu read the situation and smiled, his heart settling.

In just a short while, the entire mountain’s appearance had changed once more. The golden light and darkness had fused together, making the peak look as if it were engulfed in blazing flames. Yet those flames were unlike any ordinary fire — they were pitch-black, demonic flames!

That strange flame seemed capable of burning all things; none could withstand the profound intent contained within those demonic flames.

Merely looking at it made people uneasy, as if their souls were thrown into the flames and suffered eternal burning outside the cycle of reincarnation. Within those flames was the yang vigor of True Yang Yuan Qi, impervious to ordinary evils, yet there was also a bloodthirsty, savage aura that tugged at the concealed evil thoughts in people’s hearts. This extreme, contradictory profound intent was deadly, leaving people at a loss as to how to resist or defend.

Everyone instinctively averted their gazes, unwilling to pry into its mystery.

“Looks like he’s soaring straight into the heavens…” A strange light flickered in Bi Ya’s beautiful eyes as she secretly wondered whether she ought to change her attitude toward Yang Kai — whether it was time to treat him sincerely.

She had humbled herself to serve Yang Kai as servant and handmaiden, mainly to avoid his retribution, which was why she demeaned herself and endured the humiliation.

She had never truly believed Yang Kai remarkable; she thought his unchecked behavior on the continent was all due to the Ghost Ancestor's favor. Without that patronage Yang Kai would be nothing.

Such people who borrow another's prestige to bully others were the most detestable.

So although she had been attentive and obliging to Yang Kai, none of it came from sincere feeling. She even looked down on him.

But now she dared not think that way.

The youth genuinely possessed unique qualities; someone with such vast potential would be courted by the powers in the Star Domain. Given enough time he could unleash astonishing brilliance.

He would occupy important ranks and become a hegemon in his region; cultivating good relations with him would do her no harm.

Bi Ya's eyes rippled like jade; glancing at others, she saw Lü Guichen and Yue Xi wearing extremely grave expressions, without the earlier contempt toward Yang Kai.

She knew those two had finally recognized Yang Kai's capabilities and were surely making their own plans.

Unable to help herself, Bi Ya felt a subtle superiority: being close at hand, able to serve Yang Kai, gave her shameful yet intoxicating excitement. She licked her ruby-like lips, her body tinged with heat.

Once concluding Yang Kai was unharmed, Shen Tu no longer focused on the mountain and went about his business.

At the Sword Alliance, only four or five warriors remained gathered. Yue Xi frowned, hesitated, and after a cough said, "I take back my earlier words. You two sisters should spend more time around him. Ask him whether he wishes to join the Sword Alliance; if he is willing, so much the better — if not, forget it."

He Zao and He Miao exchanged glances, their eyes brightening, and both nodded, "Yes, Master!"

He Miao said, "Actually he's not a bad person, it's just that he always fraternizes with that bitch Bi Ya, which is disgraceful!"

Yue Xi shot her a glance. "You may interact with him, but keep enough distance so you aren't taken advantage of."

"Understood, Master!" He Miao nodded earnestly.

Inside the stone chamber, Yang Kai continued to run the Dual Cultivation Technique, guiding the two different forces to merge and converge.

At first the process was not smooth; conflicts occurred when guiding the forces back into his body, but they caused no serious harm.

As time passed he found everything growing incomparably smooth, without any obstruction.

The evil energy surging from the Indomitable Golden Body and the energy contained in the Yang Liquid that burst open in his Dantian, aside from a small initial consumption, returned in full with not a trace wasted.

Yang Kai clearly felt himself rapidly growing stronger.

The power contained in his flesh was now incomparable to before, filling him with rapture like tasting sweet nectar.

The Ghost Ancestor had been right: fusing the two forces truly caused earth-shattering changes in his strength — changes that were apparent and perceptible.

Sensing this, he greedily ran the Dual Cultivation Technique even more vigorously.

The entire mountain became an invisible vortex, spinning and drawing the continent's Spiritual Qi toward it.
