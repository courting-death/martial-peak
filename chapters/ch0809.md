## Chapter 809 — Proof

As that voice rang out, an overwhelmingly dangerous aura swept over, causing the hairs on Yang Kai’s body to rise and forcing his True Yuan to circulate uncontrollably to resist the invisible pressure from that beautiful silhouette.

The opponent was a woman—an exceptionally beautiful woman.

Neatly dressed in a moon‑white long gown that wrapped her graceful figure, the skirt patterned with small flowers made her appear delicate and charming, yet her bearing was razor-sharp.

Behind her spread a pair of brilliantly multicolored wings, unlike Yang Kai’s Wind-and-Thunder Wings; they resembled butterfly wings—broad and lively, fluttering lightly and scattering intoxicating fragrances.

Though the wings looked thin, they had clearly been cultivated into something like a Secret Treasure; their edges flashed with cold light—Yang Kai had no doubt that those wings alone could cleave metal and crush stone, rivaling the sharpest weapons under heaven.

At her appearance, the yao experts who had been observing Yang Kai fell silent and respectfully saluted.

Saint Realm! Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he immediately judged that this small winged woman had reached the Saint Realm—and not a low tier at that.

For her to exert such massive pressure, she must be at least Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

“No, Lady Caidie, please listen to my explanation,” Kuang Shi—having been knocked to the ground and buried in mud—struggled up again, battered and bruised but showing no defiance as he called out anxiously.

“What is there to explain?” Caidie looked coldly at Kuang Shi and gave a slight flick of her hand; an invisible tugging force caused the Secret Treasures and pills in Kuang Shi’s arms to tumble into her palm.

“You accepted benefits from a human and brought him to Thundertree Palace? Kuang Shi, how dare you!” Caidie’s voice dropped coldly; her wings fluttered faster, and murderous intent gleamed in her beautiful eyes.

Kuang Shi’s face drained of color as he waved his hands anxiously. “It’s not like that—no, no… it was like this: the human gave me some things and I brought him here. But… there were reasons!”

“I don’t care your reasons—dare to break the rules set by the Great Yao Lord and die you shall!” Caidie snorted and was about to strike Kuang Shi.

Yang Kai hurried a step forward; the motion alone seemed to stir the nerves of many yao experts, and countless gazes snapped onto him. Waves of pressure rushed in from all directions.

Yang Kai’s flesh rippled to resist that bone‑crushing pressure; he slowly put his foot down and stepped forward.

The yao experts displayed astonished expressions—they hadn’t expected someone of Yang Kai’s cultivation to manage such a feat.

“Lady Caidie?” Yang Kai cupped his fist and spoke calmly and without fear: “I am Yang Kai, the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. I entrusted Brother Kuang to guide me to Thundertree Palace because I wish to see the Great Yao Lord on important business.”

“The new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?” Caidie’s brows knit; she seemed skeptical.

“Yes, Lady Caidie. Because he’s from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land I brought him here. Otherwise I wouldn’t have had the gall to do so. Lady Caidie, please judge.” Kuang Shi nodded rapidly, sweat beading on his brow, secretly fearing he’d made a grave mistake in bringing Yang Kai.

“You say you are—prove it,” Caidie’s expression turned even colder. “What evidence do you have?”

“The Saint Lord’s Spirit Ring is the best proof.” Yang Kai raised the ring on his hand.

The yao experts observed for a moment, then laughed together.

Caidie snorted coldly. “How can a ring alone prove your identity? That ring was indeed worn by the one who used to come to my Thundertree Palace, but how do I know where you obtained it?”

“What proof do you require then?” Yang Kai asked, his gaze frosty.

Caidie tossed her head and rose, hopping up to the branch where the cat-eared woman sat. She said calmly, “No need for your proof—dare to come here and you only deserve death! Kuang Shi, you brought this person; you know what to do.”

Kuang Shi hesitated, then looked at Yang Kai with a complex gaze and gave a slight nod: “Understood.”

“Kuang Shi, do your job well—don’t lose to this human.”

“Go on—rip his heart out, human hearts are the tastiest.”

“If you fail, we’ll all look down on you.”

The yao experts on the branch shouted eagerly, full of anticipation like spectators awaiting a show.

Kuang Shi cursed under his breath; though reluctant, with Caidie’s words he had no choice. He looked at Yang Kai helplessly: “Kid, sorry. If you die here don’t blame Kuang Shi for striking too hard.”

“Then strike, Brother Kuang.” Yang Kai smiled faintly and taunted Caidie, “I want to see what the yao’s experts can do.”

“Sister Caidie, this one is interesting—he’s not afraid at all.” The cat-eared girl looked at Yang Kai with surprise.

“Hmph, humans love bluffing. He’ll have his comeuppance.” Caidie snorted, sounding as if she knew humans well.

“Yes, yes—Kuang Shi will tear him apart!” the cat-eared girl nodded eagerly.

A roar came from below as Kuang Shi’s furious mane flared; like a war chariot he charged at Yang Kai with unstoppable momentum.

Though he used no refined technique, the force of his charge could smash through a mountain.

Yang Kai intended to test his strength and did not dodge; his flesh tensed and he met Kuang Shi head-on.

Boom…

A violent burst of energy sent Yang Kai flying uncontrollably.

Face darkening, he realized he had underestimated Kuang Shi’s power.

That raw brute force alone could let him dominate many foes.

In midair Yang Kai quickly stabilized and landed, stumbling several steps back before stopping.

“So weak…” the cat-eared girl snorted, disappointed—yet Caidie’s eyes narrowed in surprise.

She had thought Yang Kai lacked prowess; his energy fluctuations suggested his strength was slightly below Kuang Shi’s.

But after that collision she saw that although Yang Kai hadn’t blocked the blow, he bore no injuries.

She had expected his arms to be crushed.

Interesting—this kid had some skill. Caidie’s interest was piqued.

After knocking Yang Kai back, Kuang Shi—dissatisfied—gave no pause and lunged again, releasing wild, bloodthirsty yao energy.

“Kuang Shi, be careful!” Yang Kai watched coldly and made a single downward slash with one hand.

Suddenly a golden greatsword manifested in the void, descending with irresistible force toward Kuang Shi’s head.

The greatsword cleaved with such ferocity it seemed to split the very space.

Kuang Shi, mid-charge, froze and raised his arms to block the strike.

Clang…

The Profound Heaven Sword struck Kuang Shi’s arms like metal on metal with a clear ring; the golden greatsword shattered, and a shallow wound opened on Kuang Shi’s arm, blood seeping out.

“Huh?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, his expression lifted with excitement.

Kuang Shi’s arms had actually blocked the Profound Heaven Sword, showing his flesh was as tough as high‑grade Secret Treasures.

The yao indeed had their tricks.

Though wounded, Kuang Shi seemed unconcerned; after the sword shattered a blinding light burst from his body and, while Yang Kai was momentarily distracted, he flashed behind him and unleashed sharp claws toward Yang Kai’s back.

A strike connected, ripping Yang Kai from the middle as if he had been split in two.

Kuang Shi froze, sensing something wrong—he hadn’t felt resistance nor seen blood spatter.

“Kuang Shi—behind you!” the cat-eared girl exclaimed anxiously.

Yang Kai smiled slightly as a spear appeared in his hand and he hurled it straight at Kuang Shi before the beast could turn.

Heaven‑Slaying Spear!

Kuang Shi reacted swiftly; warned by the cat-eared girl, he dodged and leapt into the air, diving like a hawk to block, forming a sealing space of yao energy that cut off Yang Kai’s retreat.

A massive palm imprint surged toward Kuang Shi’s face, growing larger and more terrifying until it obscured his vision.

Heaven‑Covering Palm!

Boom…

Kuang Shi was struck and tumbled dozens of times before crashing heavily to the ground.

The yao on the branch were stunned.

Despite their cultivation and power, none could reconcile how Yang Kai—apparently weaker on paper—could so effortlessly toy with Kuang Shi, denying him any chance to close in and leaving him beaten.

They were unsettled by this.

Kuang Shi got to his feet, fury now stoked; his yao energy seethed unstably, his eyes reddened as if about to bleed, vowing not to stop until Yang Kai was dead.

Yang Kai remained unperturbed, countering with the Nine Heavens Divine Technique with casual ease.

From start to finish he hadn’t used his full strength; this fight had been staged for the gaze of the one watching over this place.

If he was correct, that watcher was the Great Yao Lord.
