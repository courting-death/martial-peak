## Chapter 1302 — Silver Night Thunder Beast

When Shen Shitao learned that the helper Lü Ying had summoned was actually Yang Kai, her mood instantly turned awkward; a bitter smile flickered at the corner of her mouth. Though she had deliberately tried to befriend Yang Kai to cultivate ties—so she could invite him along on future trials—if they couldn't even survive this moment, what would the future matter?

Yang Kai only possessed the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm—how could he possibly break the sealing array here and rescue the three of them?

Still, since he had come to help, Shen Shitao, despite her disappointment, said nothing more. She was about to voice her thanks when Wang Yuhan of Jidao Sect, fretful and furious, snapped, "What good is bringing him? We strained ourselves to help you escape and you bring this one? Do you want us to die sooner?"

It wasn't an outright insult, but the remark was harsh nonetheless.

Lü Ying's face turned deathly pale; she stared at Wang Yuhan mutely, guilt and unease written all over her.

Shen Shitao's pretty face hardened. "Senior Brother Wang, isn't that a bit excessive? Don't you know what place this is? Normally no one comes to Zangxiong Valley to act. It's already miraculous that Junior Sister Lü Ying could bring Brother Yang; what more do you want?"

She scolded Wang Yuhan without a shred of courtesy. His expression soured; though he offered no rebuttal, his displeasure was obvious.

Yang Kai, standing outside, finally tore his gaze away from his observation point and glanced at him coolly, but said nothing. The man's words clearly demeaned him; Yang Kai felt annoyed but couldn't be bothered to argue.

What occupied his attention instead was the sealing array and the Silver Night Thunder Beast within.

The array needn't be elaborated on. With a Thunder Pool here, this place must once have been a forbidden ground of Guyang Sect—set aside for practitioners of thunder-element techniques and martial skills. How the Silver Night Thunder Beast had managed to open the array and trap Shen Shitao and the others inside was a mystery.

The Silver Night Thunder Beast itself was a thunder-attributed demonic beast. With the Thunder Pool assisting and fighting inside the array where it held the terrain advantage, its power could, as Lü Ying said, manifest beyond normal limits.

The Silver Night Thunder Beast had a rather peculiar appearance — the body of a deer, the tail of a leopard, its whole form wreathed in flickering lightning. Its surface was covered in a thick layer of scales, each as large as a man’s palm and seemingly indestructible at a glance. Ordinary attacks would never be able to pierce its defense.

Two curved horns grew from its brow, veins of electricity roaring along them. When its massive head swayed it drew the azure clouds above, calling down the heaven's lightning to strike its horns; then the lightning would burst from those horns and rush outward toward its foes. Those horns seemed to amplify the thunder's power.

From time to time it would gape its maw and spit out spherical bolts of thunder. When those thunder-orbs struck in front of Shen Shitao and the others they burst, releasing writhing strands of lightning that slithered like snakes—devastating and hard to guard against.

The three took refuge behind a giant umbrella some three zhang across. The umbrella radiated notable energy fluctuations, its surface etched with moving runes and shifting halos. It was clearly the Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure Lü Ying had mentioned—the Nine Palace Sky-Net Umbrella.

Any thunder-type attack that made contact was blunted by a wondrous layer of power from the Nine Palace Sky-Net Umbrella, its force greatly diminished.

Yang Kai watched for a moment and immediately realized that, without this defensive Secret Treasure, Shen Shitao and the others would have died countless times over by now.

Though the umbrella took most of the Silver Night Thunder Beast's assaults, the three were still in dire straits. Wang Yuhan stood before his side with a colorful folding screen that turned out to be another defensive Secret Treasure; attacks that Shen Shitao couldn't withstand were caught by that screen and the lightning arcs poured into it and vanished—where they went no one knew.

The last one, Shen Fanlei, bore lightning on his person like the beast itself; he made no defensive moves but inhaled deeply, drawing the scattered thunder-forces into his belly.

Among the three, he appeared the most at ease — the scattered bolts of lightning not only failed to harm him but instead seemed to strengthen his power.

This caught Yang Kai's attention. He judged that Shen Fanlei either had an unusual constitution or cultivated an extraordinary technique. His spirit was as sharp as ever, his eyes bright and full of vigor.

The three formed mutual cover against the beast's onslaught and for the moment had no immediate mortal danger. But if this state continued, once Shen Shitao and Wang Yuhan's Saint Yuan waned, their defeat and death would be only a matter of time; even Shen Fanlei's special constitution and technique could not save them forever.

“Brother Yang!” Shen Shitao called out amid the chaos, her voice tinged with urgency. “If you have any means left, use them quickly — we can’t hold on much longer!”

She saw Yang Kai stand motionless, neither helping nor leaving at once, and grew anxious.

Yang Kai said calmly, "Wait a little longer."

Shen Shitao's face turned bitter and she stopped pressing him. Wang Yuhan, however, shot Yang Kai a cold, disdainful look, as if thinking Yang Kai should have left if he refused to help.

Lü Ying, anxious, had already joined the fight, but being outside the array she could only attack the array itself and try to break it.

No one but Yang Kai noticed Yang Yan had secretly acted. Yang Kai had entrusted the job of breaking the array to Yang Yan, which was why he had not rashly intervened.

The array was clearly extraordinary, powered by the Thunder Pool; it was not something brute force could tear apart quickly—why waste effort?

A moment later Yang Yan whispered, "You may act now. It took me time to crack it—my way is slower than a direct assault—but I've redirected its energy source. You need only attack."

"Good!" Yang Kai finally nodded and once more unleashed the Hundred Mountains Painting. This time, unlike the previous rescue, twenty phantom peaks surged out from it, each larger than the last. Under his urging they mercilessly smashed toward the array.

"I thought he had some skill; turns out he relies on brute force. Miss Shen, we cannot pin our hopes on this brat; we must rely on ourselves!" Wang Yuhan taunted when he saw Yang Kai use the same method as before. "Did he not see that with the Thunder Pool supporting it the array cannot be broken by force?"

Shen Shitao frowned. She thought Yang Kai's assault reckless too, but Wang Yuhan's words rankled her and her pretty face went cold; she gave no reply.

The phantom peaks struck the array with tremendous force, shaking it to the brink, and at the same time torrents of lightning from the Thunder Pool surged out to replenish the array's energy.

Shen Shitao and Wang Yuhan had seen this countless times; precisely because of that replenishment they had not wasted effort attacking the array. With the lightning resupplying it, that layer of the array was practically unbreakable for them.

What astonished them beyond measure was that the lightning spilling from the Thunder Pool only flowed across the array briefly before, for some reason, being diverted outward; the array itself received no replenishment.

Looking outward, beyond the array's perimeter, they saw a length of wood—looking like a dead log—stationary in place. All the diverted lightning streamed into that log and then disappeared into the earth.

They were stunned and delighted; they could not fathom how a mere stub of dead wood could perform such a miraculous function.

Yang Kai did not know either, but he had complete confidence in Yang Yan. Seeing that the diversion worked, he redoubled the Hundred Mountains Painting's might and continued to batter the array.

He did not intend to linger; his attack unleashed a force far more terrifying than last time. Shen Shitao watched in secret alarm, realizing Yang Kai had concealed part of his strength before.

Yang Kai pounded on the array, and the Silver Night Thunder Beast inside would not sit idly by. Sensing danger it let out a roar like a bull and a tiger. The azure clouds stirred; a lightning bolt thicker than a man's leg shot down and struck the beast's horns. A ferocious flash, even fiercer than before, streaked from those horns and hurled straight at Yang Kai.

"Brother Yang, watch out!" Shen Shitao called, knowing the attack's power. Without the Nine Palace Sky-Net Umbrella she dared not attempt to block it. Yang Kai, only of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, would likely be annihilated if struck.

To her surprise, Yang Kai remained rooted. Before him a lilac-tinted shield shimmered into being. Wind-and-earth power welled upon that shield, and a vast sandstorm formed, standing between Yang Kai and the lightning.

With a crack the lightning plunged into the sandstorm but was obstructed by the swirling grit, dissipating and vanishing within moments.

"An Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure!" Wang Yuhan exclaimed, eyes greedy as he looked at the shield.

He was a disciple of Jidao Sect at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, yet he had never obtained an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure of Middle-Level or above. Shen Shitao must have gotten hers from a sect elder's reward, but where had this Yang gotten such a treasure?

Judging from its defensive potency, it appeared no less effective than the Nine Palace Sky-Net Umbrella.

Comparing his own treasure, Wang Yuhan suddenly felt his possessions shabby and grew resentful.
