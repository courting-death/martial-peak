## Chapter 1500 — Go Well on Your Way

It was no wonder Liang Yong was panic‑stricken in mind; just now, Yang Kai had stood unshaken even while facing the wild bombardment of so many people alone, and now that he had even activated a formation, would he not be all the more troublesome?

Moreover, under the probing of Divine Sense, Liang Yong simply could not tell where Yang Kai was hiding. In this bizarre place, it felt as if only their dozen‑odd people existed, and no one else.

He did not believe this formation was merely to trap them; Yang Kai would certainly make some moves.

“Everyone, come over here—do not scatter.” Liang Yong suddenly barked in a low voice. They could not locate Yang Kai’s traces for the moment, but regardless, only by these dozen or so watching over one another would they have any chance of holding out until the Alliance Master and the others broke the formation; otherwise, if Yang Kai picked them off one by one, an annihilation of the entire force was very likely.

Yang Kai’s ferocious methods from before had left an especially deep impression on him.

Hearing Liang Yong’s shout, everyone came back to their senses and hurriedly moved toward his position.

But at that moment, a sudden change erupted.

The white clouds that had been drifting in the sky actually dove down at lightning speed. Each cloud looked like a massive lump of cotton candy, pure white and immaculate.

Although they did not know what was strange about these clouds, none dared let them approach lightly; one after another they executed movement arts to evade, or summoned Secret Treasures to attack.

Yet those clouds seemed formless and intangible; even when struck they only dispersed slightly, and very quickly condensed back together.

“What the hell are these things!” A middle‑aged man showed impatience, pouring Saint Yuan into a long halberd‑shaped Secret Treasure in his hand and chopping down viciously, intending to cleave apart the cloud barring his way.

This middle‑aged man’s cultivation was at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his strength not bad. The long halberd in his hand was an Origin‑Grade Middle‑Level Secret Treasure, discovered by chance during an outing in a cave. He regarded it as a precious treasure; it had aided him many times in killing strong enemies, and he relied on it heavily.

A dazzling rainbow erupted from the halberd, neatly splitting the cloud ahead into two. The middle‑aged man snorted coldly; his figure flickered as he shot forward to pass through the gap he had opened.

Just as he was about to pass through, the cloud that had been cleaved in two rapidly closed toward the center, wrapping the middle‑aged man inside in an instant.

A startled shout came from within.

Immediately after, that cloud, roughly twenty zhang across, squirmed and transformed, turning into a majestic lion.

The lion stood over seven or eight zhang tall, its whole body ocher‑yellow. It raised its head and let out a deafening lion’s roar, and earth‑shaking energy fluctuations surged from within it.

Visible to the naked eye, the lion’s abdomen kept bulging and sinking, as though something inside were struggling to break out.

That was obviously the middle‑aged man who had just been wrapped by the cloud.

But he was powerless. As the lion’s belly swelled and contracted, a world‑shaking force burst forth. Very soon, a series of cracking sounds came from within, as if someone’s bones were being ground to powder.

The movement inside the lion’s belly abruptly ceased, and a breath of life quickly winked out.

“Kuang Shi?” Liang Yong’s face twisted in fright as he cried out in shock.

With a single glance he recognized what demonic beast that lion was, yet at this moment it was still somewhat different from a real demonic beast: it did not release any yao qi, merely maintaining the form of a Kuang Shi. But the energy surging from within it was in no way inferior to an adult Kuang Shi!

That was a Ninth‑Tier peak demonic beast; in single combat it could suppress a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and even against an ordinary Third Stage it would not be at a disadvantage.

No sooner had Liang Yong’s voice fallen than all the clouds in every direction writhed and transformed. In the next instant, enormous demonic beasts of different shapes appeared before everyone’s eyes.

Charging‑Horn Giant Rhinoceros, Deep‑Sea Ink Jiao, Xuantian Dark Tiger, Howling‑Moon Mad Wolf, Iron‑Back Giant Centipede, Gold‑Thread Venom Toad…

There were all sorts, too many to count, each with a ferocious build.

No matter which kind, the weakest were at Eighth‑Tier level, and there was no shortage of Ninth‑Tier ones. Each looked somewhat different from authentic demonic beasts—not only were they enormous, their might was astonishing.

As soon as these demonic beasts finished taking form, they each chose the nearest targets and madly launched attacks against the dozen‑odd Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

The demonic beasts were far too many, and in an instant they split everyone apart—some forced into single combat, others besieged in groups of three or five.

The dozen‑plus Origin Returning Realm cultivators of the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect were immediately hard‑pressed, cries of alarm rising one after another. Though their cultivations were not low and their strength not weak, trapped inside a formation and besieged by so many demonic beasts, they had already lost their nerve before the fight even truly began.

What drove them to despair even more was that these demonic beasts seemed to possess undying bodies; even if beaten apart, they would quickly reassemble, vexing to no end.

Less than half a cup of tea after the battle began, casualties appeared. No one knew whether the fallen man was from the Leitai Sect or the Battle Sky Alliance; caught off guard, a warrior was nailed squarely by a Charging‑Horn Giant Lizard, the enormous impact sending him flying high into the air.

Before he could land, a dark‑green Jiao several tens of zhang long shot in from the side. Swaying its head and tail, it opened a blood‑filled maw, fangs bared, and bit down on his body.

The protective Saint Yuan around him flared wildly, but still could not withstand the bite force of the Deep‑Sea Ink Jiao.

With a crisp crack, the protective Saint Yuan shattered, and the warrior’s body was bitten cleanly into two halves. Blood sprayed across the ground, his death miserably ghastly.

The dying scream he emitted was hair‑raising, making everyone’s backs go cold. They had already been struggling bitterly, barely able to protect themselves; now, with their minds shaken, their situation became all the more unbearable.

“Yang Kai, get out here and face this old man head‑on. Why skulk in the dark?” Liang Yong roared in furious urgency.

Yang Kai’s hearty laugh rang out at once. “Elder Liang, there is no need to provoke me. I will naturally come out when it is time. As for you lot… heh‑heh, properly experience the might of this Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation—and then, go well on your way!”

That voice was ethereal—seemingly right before their eyes, yet also as distant as the horizon. Liang Yong could not lock onto Yang Kai’s position at all; for a time, his face turned ashen, despair to the extreme.

From Yang Kai’s words, however, he at least learned what this damned formation was.

Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation! Liang Yong was not versed in the Dao of Formations and did not know its mysteries, but someone cried out in alarm, “Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation—actually the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation? Impossible! This formation has long been lost; there is simply no way anyone could arrange it.”

“Oh? This friend knows a little, it seems you have dabbled in the Dao of Formations. True enough—at Dark Star’s current level, no one could possibly arrange a Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation. However, mine was not set up by any cultivator of the present age.”

“Could it be…” That person’s expression changed drastically, quickly catching on.

The fact that no one now could arrange it did not mean that no one in ancient or primordial times could.

The difficulty of arranging the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation lies in those clouds. They are genuine clouds, refined by a cultivator whose prowess reaches the heavens, who—with great divine ability—smelts the clouds of the firmament and seals within them the Spirit Essence of powerful demonic beasts; only thus can the components of the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation be formed.

On Dark Star today, the strongest cultivators are only at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Who has the ability to refine the clouds in the sky?

Only the Void King Realm has such a possibility.

After refinement, those clouds—fused with demonic beasts’ Spirit Essences—can transform into extremely troublesome cloud beasts that can display the strength those demonic beasts possessed in life. Furthermore, because they are cloud‑formed, they are troublesome to the extreme, virtually undying; once scattered, they can rapidly reassemble.

Yang Kai had obtained the Formation Talisman of the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation during his first foray deep into the Imperial Garden.

He had warmed and refined it within his body for so long, and had only used it once—during his second foray into the Imperial Garden, when he hunted the variant of the Seven‑Colored Stag.

That variant Seven‑Colored Stag was too fast; without a formation to restrain it, Yang Kai had simply had no way to handle it.

Other than that, he had never again used this Formation Talisman.

This time, however, with so many people besieging him, it was the perfect opportunity to bring out the talisman’s power.

Back then, when Fei Zhi Tu and the others fell into the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation, they could only barely protect themselves, which showed how formidable the formation was. Moreover, at that time there had been no one presiding over it; it only counterattacked by itself and could display merely twenty or thirty percent of its might.

Now that the formation was under Yang Kai’s control, if not the full hundred, it could at least bring out seventy or eighty percent of its power.

With his vast and formidable Divine Sense, commanding those cloud beasts of no small strength was naturally no difficulty. If his power were strong enough, he could control even more cloud beasts and slaughter those people all the more easily.

Hidden in the dark, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense flitted about as he directed the cloud beasts to launch attacks on the enemy, without the slightest softness or mercy.

Since he had already torn all pretense with the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect, he naturally had nothing to scruple over.

He asked for no trouble, yet was forced to this point; since they wanted to deal with him, then they should not dream of a comfortable end.

A dozen‑plus Origin Returning Realm experts was not a weak lineup, but split apart by the cloud beasts, unable to watch over one another and forced to face the enemy alone, they were naturally no match for those cloud beasts.

Given sufficient time, it was an ironclad certainty that the cloud beasts would kill them all.

However, Yang Kai suddenly knit his brows and turned to look toward a certain location.

As the master of the Formation Talisman of the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation, he could naturally sense that the people outside were at this very moment launching a ferocious assault on this place, the force extremely great. It likely would not take long before the formation was broken.

That was not something Yang Kai wanted to see.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai pointed with a finger. The Artifact Spirit Fire Bird flew out again, spreading its wings and rolling up a sky‑filling heatwave.

“Go!” Yang Kai instructed faintly. The Fire Bird immediately streaked out, lying in wait for a chance to kill.

Nor was that all. Yang Kai reached out, and a long sword of jade‑green appeared in his hand. The sword had neither edge nor point, looking exceedingly strange; at the hilt was a green pearl the size of a dragon’s eye, and within the blade, something like a little snake seemed to be swimming.

The Dragon Bone sword, Dripping Jade.

Saint Yuan poured madly within, and an awe‑inspiring majesty surged from the Dragon Bone sword. In the next instant, a Jade‑Green Giant Dragon manifested before Yang Kai. With a high, sonorous dragon’s roar, and without needing Yang Kai’s meticulous control, it swayed its head and tail and pounced toward the nearest enemy.
