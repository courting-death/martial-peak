## Chapter 1260 — Placement

Yang Kai kept the other spiritual herbs and medicines he gathered in the Flowing Flame Sandland, such as Cui Luo Grass, Purple Jade Fruit, Golden Sun Fruit, and so on; since he could use these materials to refine pills, of course he did not give them to Yang Yan.

As for items like the Red Candle Fruit, the Red Candle Base, the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, the Golden Sun Fruit tree, and the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense, he had his own plans for them and likewise kept them.

Yang Yan left in high spirits after taking those materials; with her talent and so many good items, she could naturally set herself free to accomplish great deeds, and before departing she even gave Yang Kai a palm-sized token.

The seal script on the token flowed and looked extremely arcane.

With that token, Yang Kai could freely enter and exit this particular stone abode of his, and he could also activate the seals within it; once those seals were engaged, no one besides Yang Kai could enter the entire Dragon Lair Mountain — not even Yang Yan herself, unless she forcibly broke the formation.

Yang Kai was very pleased by this; Yang Yan had obviously taken his feelings into account, which was why she used this method to create a dwelling no one could trespass.

He had no intention of moving into the newly built elegant pavilions outside — this stone abode suited him perfectly. Perhaps because long ago he had once carved out a cave-dwelling in the cliff of Dragon Confinement Ravine at Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai held a fondness for such stone houses; living in one made him feel secure and secluded, ideal for meditation and cultivation.

Yang Yan had also been sufficiently meticulous in arranging this stone abode; this place contained the densest seals and the strictest defenses in the whole of Dragon Lair Mountain. The spiritual qi was exceptionally concentrated; when Yang Kai returned and probed with his divine sense, he could not perceive the interior of this stone abode.

After Yang Yan left, Yang Kai sat cross-legged where he was and was lost in thought for a long time. He had already vaguely sensed that not only Yang Yan, but also Wu Yi, Yu Feng, Chang Qi, Hao An, and those dozens of Haike Family disciples had come to regard this place as somewhere they could rely on — even as a home — and so each of them had put great care into its construction.

This pleased Yang Kai greatly.

After pondering for a while, he took out his alchemy furnace. Using Cui Luo Grass and several other medicines, he refined several batches of Origin Condensing Pills. Perhaps this trip to the Flowing Flame Sandland had helped him grow a great deal; this time refining Origin Condensing Pills went much more smoothly than before, and more than half of the pills he produced had formed Pill Patterns.

The Origin Condensing Pills were naturally intended for Chang Qi and Hao An; the two of them had been stuck at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm bottleneck for so many years that they likely only needed one Origin Condensing Pill each to break through to the Origin Returning Realm.

But after making the pills, Yang Kai did not rush to distribute them; instead he began arranging things inside his stone abode.

In one chamber, Yang Kai spent a large amount of Saint Crystal and even used Wan Yao Ling Ye to create an area where spiritual qi was extraordinarily dense. The stone abode’s qi was already decent, and with those Saint Crystals and the Wan Yao Ling Ye, the concentration of spiritual qi immediately rose another level.

Inside that chamber he opened a small medicinal garden and carefully placed the Red Candle Base beside a pool formed by diluting Wan Yao Ling Ye; with so much spiritual qi and spiritual water supplied, the Red Candle Base should not wither, especially since its own vitality was extraordinarily tenacious.

Then Yang Kai took out that small segment of Red Candle Fruit flesh; though he knew that once cut it could not be restored to its original state, he still placed the piece atop the Red Candle Base, hoping that the root which birthed the Red Candle Fruit would maintain or even strengthen its medicinal properties.

Yang Kai could not use the Red Candle Fruit now, nor could he refine it into a pill, but it might be needed in the future.

After finishing this, Yang Kai used the token to activate all the seals in that chamber. A shimmering screen flickered as if ripples flowed outward, and everything inside the chamber suddenly and eerily vanished: not only could the pool formed by the diluted Wan Yao Ling Ye and the Red Candle Base and Red Candle Fruit not be seen with the naked eye, they could not be detected at all by divine sense.

Apart from the unusually dense spiritual qi, there was nothing else suspicious about the place.

Satisfied, Yang Kai sealed the chamber completely and then moved on to arrange the adjacent chamber.

In the second chamber he placed the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense he had obtained from the sixth stage of the Flowing Flame Sandland and the censer for burning it. In an instant a faint, clear fragrance filled the entire chamber. The scent calmed Yang Kai’s mind; it was as if all troubles and displeasures vanished, and even the Sea of Consciousness became as still as a deep well — tranquil and serene.

The effect of the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense lived up to its name; sitting in meditation under this fragrance for long periods would benefit anyone greatly.

Using the token, he likewise sealed the second chamber completely.

The current incense aroma could only waft within the stone abode, but Yang Kai could ask Yang Yan to find a way to let it drift outside; that way, cultivators residing on Dragon Lair Mountain could all benefit during their practice.

Keeping this in mind, Yang Kai then went to the third chamber.

After a moment, he left the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree in the third chamber. In this way, anyone who entered seclusion within the stone abode could rely on the tree’s strange energies to glimpse the Dao and martial path and thereby break through bottlenecks.

However, with Origin Condensing Pills to assist Chang Qi and Hao An, and with the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense, they might not even need to make use of the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree.

Having finished, Yang Kai walked to one side and stared at an odd stone pitted with hollows.

This odd stone was the Zhi Stone he had spent a great deal of Saint Crystals to buy at the last auction.

After buying it, Yang Kai had placed the Soul-Devouring insects inside to raise them; Yang Yan had said that Zhi Stones were ideal for letting strange insects and beasts grow strong. Before heading to the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai had warned Yang Yan and the others not to touch this Zhi Stone, and now it lay quietly in the corner as before.

But when Yang Kai probed with his divine sense, he found thousands upon thousands of tiny Soul-Devouring insects sleeping inside the Zhi Stone, so small they could not be seen with the naked eye.

Moreover, a large cavity seemed to have formed within the Zhi Stone.

The Soul-Devouring insects were still evolving and could not be used yet; only when the Zhi Stone completely vanished would they emerge.

In addition, the Six-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus in Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness was also evolving; with the Soul-Devouring insects having no place to settle yet, Yang Kai was in no hurry to let them out.

Yang Kai held great expectations for the evolving Soul-Devouring insects, curious how they would change once evolution finished. After some thought he put the Zhi Stone away, placing it in the same chamber as the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree.

He then went out of the stone abode and called Chang Qi and Hao An in. He gave each of them an Origin Condensing Pill and told them to choose an empty chamber to enter seclusion.

He believed it would not be long before the first two Origin Returning Realm experts were born on Dragon Lair Mountain.

Even though it was only the First Stage, having the Origin Returning Realm here meant that in the future, when Yang Kai was absent, they could cooperate with the mountain’s many wondrous formations to guard the place.

Over the next few days Yang Kai kept busy; no one knew exactly what he was doing, but soon everyone was surprised to find a Golden Sun Fruit tree had appeared in a certain spot on Dragon Lair Mountain. Although the fruits on the tree had already vanished, the tree was still a spiritual fruit tree: besides beautifying the mountain, it gave everyone hope.

Yang Yan gave Yang Kai a harsh scolding for transplanting the Golden Sun Fruit tree; after listening to her nagging he realized he had been presumptuous before.

The Golden Sun Fruit tree’s environmental requirements were too exacting; without his Black Book Space, it would surely have died in the Spatial Ring, and even transplanted here its survival chance was under thirty percent. Yang Yan had gone to great lengths to lay formations around it to gather the heaven-and-earth spiritual qi for its use, yet even so no one dared guarantee whether the tree would survive.

But the seed of the Blood Sword Grass underwent a change that terrified both Yang Kai and Yang Yan.

Originally, after taking the Blood Sword Grass seed, Yang Yan had casually planted it somewhere; because she had not provided flesh for it, she did not expect the seed to germinate right away and only kept it as a contingency: if someone attacked Dragon Lair Mountain and bloodshed occurred nearby, the seed could absorb the blood and burst forth, catching the enemy unawares.

On a whim, Yang Kai dripped a drop of Golden Blood onto the spot where the Blood Sword Grass seed had been planted.

In the blink of an eye the seed began to sprout and then grew wildly, shooting up to about ten zhang in height before stopping; that was not all — in the surrounding soil countless more Blood Sword Grass shoots erupted one after another. Although none were as lush and tall as the first, many still reached roughly two zhang high.

In less than half an hour, centered on where the seed had been planted, a hundred-zhang radius was filled with blade-like grass. Yang Yan stood pale-faced and screamed in shock.

Moreover, these Blood Sword Grass were different from those Yang Kai had seen before; they were not crimson like blood but each emitted a faint golden glow, eye-catching indeed.

The incident left Yang Yan dumbfounded, and Yang Kai stood stunned on the spot as well.

He had not expected a single drop of his Golden Blood to cause such a change; he had only dripped one drop to see the effect.

The mishap nearly caused casualties among nearby cultivators, but Yang Kai’s timely rescue saved a Haike Family warrior from being sliced by the Blood Sword Grass.
