## Chapter 1178 — How Did He Come To Die Like That?

The Hundred Mountains Painting is a secret treasure that excels in one‑on‑one combat, but it is equally suited to slaughtering groups.

Those eight massive mountain phantoms appeared hazy and ethereal, yet each bore the weight of a true mountain. They needed no special momentum — their very descent was powerful enough. As Yang Kai poured his Saint Yuan into them in a frenzy, the falling phantoms began to carry a trace of Demonic Flame. In an instant, the entire valley trembled violently, and the swarming Fire Spirit Beasts rushed forward only to vanish in waves beneath the crashing peaks.

This was the first time Yang Kai used the Hundred Mountains Painting, and he suddenly discovered the treasure’s usefulness was considerable — at the very least it was much faster than using his Profound Heaven Sword and Heaven‑Slaying Spear to kill the fire spirit beasts. He put away the Demonic Flame longsword and focused wholly on unleashing the Hundred Mountains Painting’s power.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A violent thunder rolled out of the valley, ear‑splitting.

Meanwhile, from the direction Yang Kai had come a party of three appeared at the valley mouth; among them two were Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, the other a First Stage of the Saint King Realm, and from their positions it was clear the two Third‑Stage cultivators were flanking and protecting the First‑Stage man.

When they reached the valley the frontmost warrior suddenly halted, his face showing puzzled suspicion as he peered into the gorge.

He would not step forward, so the other two naturally stopped as well; the man at the rear kept watch on the surroundings, while the short, stocky youth sandwiched between them wore an indifferent expression, looking this way and that as if he were sightseeing rather than adventuring through the Flowing Flame Sandland.

The three stood before the valley examining it for roughly the length of a tea, and none seemed inclined to advance; the short, stocky youth could not help urging the man ahead: “Xie Yong, what are you always staring at? Hurry up and move.”

The man called Xie Yong heard him, turned, and told the youth, “Young Master, wait a moment — this valley seems off.”

Saying that, he beckoned to the Third‑Stage Saint King cultivator at the rear; when he came forward the two of them inspected the place together, occasionally speaking in low tones.

The youth, seeing them take such a solemn tone, snorted in displeasure: “Are you making a fuss over nothing? All along we haven’t met any real danger. Those few fire spirit beasts that jumped out were slain by this Young Master with ease, weren’t they? I think this Flowing Flame Sandland is overrated — the outside rumors about how dangerous it is are just hearsay to scare the ignorant. Too bad they can’t scare this Young Master!”

That youth was none other than Xie Hongwen, and the two Third‑Stage Saint King cultivators were naturally sent by the Xie family to protect him.

Qian Tong had even told Yang Kai earlier that those two warriors were not men of Yingyue Hall.

Hearing Xie Hongwen’s words, Xie Yong and the other warrior exchanged a glance and secretly shook their heads; they knew Xie Hongwen had grown used to comfort and understood nothing of the world’s dangers. Since they’d encountered no peril these past days, Xie Hongwen thus looked down on this place.

They themselves had not been into the Flowing Flame Sandland, but since it was one of Dark Star’s three great forbidden lands, it must have its peculiarities.

If anyone else had spoken like that they would not have cared; underestimating this place’s danger could easily lead to death. Yet they were charged with protecting Xie Hongwen — if he died through negligence, they would receive no good when they returned to the Xie family.

The square‑faced warrior thought it necessary to explain to Xie Hongwen; after a moment he said sternly, “Young Master, this is merely the outermost perimeter of the Flowing Flame Sandland, and we’ve been lucky so far. The beasts we met were only Sixth‑Tier; with your might, Young Master, killing them is naturally no trouble.”

Hearing the flattery, Xie Hongwen’s impatient expression eased considerably; he assumed an air of supreme arrogance, unbearably lofty.

The warrior continued, “But Young Master, you mustn’t be careless here. Besides the Sixth‑Tier beasts we encountered, there are Seventh‑Tier, Eighth‑Tier…”

Xie Hongwen glanced and sneered at the square‑faced man, “Xie Jun, you’re underestimating me. I have many secret treasures and refined arts. Never mind Seventh‑Tier or Eighth‑Tier — even if Ninth‑Tier fire spirit beasts showed up, I’d kill them easily! I’m actually worried I won’t meet any high‑tier beasts; go fetch a few and I’ll kill them for you!”

He came across as eager to prove himself.

Though Xie Yong and Xie Yun kept calm on the surface, inwardly they were cursing Xie Hongwen to high heaven.

They’d long heard Xie Hongwen was an idiot, and only now did they find the rumors had scarcely described the depth of his foolishness.

He was only a First Stage of the Saint King Realm; not to mention killing Ninth‑Tier beasts, even Seventh‑ or Eighth‑Tier creatures could easily wipe him out. It was laughable that he bragged so shamelessly — he should fear his own tongue slipping.

There was no reasoning with a fool, so Xie Jun and Xie Yong tactfully agreed a few times, pleasing Xie Hongwen greatly. He nodded repeatedly, “Relax — if this time I get my revenge, when I return I’ll have my father write to the Family Head; you won’t be left unrewarded.”

Xie Jun and Xie Yong brightened and both nodded in agreement.

They’d taken the job precisely because Xie Hongwen’s father, Xie Li, had promised each of them three hundred thousand Saint Crystals as a huge reward; otherwise who would accompany Xie Hongwen into the Flowing Flame Sandland?

Besides, anything gained within the Flowing Flame Sandland would not have to be turned over to the family — whatever they acquired would be theirs alone.

Months ago, when the task reached the Xie household, countless disciples were eager to sign up; in the end Xie Yong and Xie Jun secured the mission by absolute advantage.

They also knew whom Xie Hongwen wanted vengeance on: a Saint King First Stage cultivator named Yang Kai.

According to Xie Hongwen, that Yang Kai was unlearned, arrogant, and lecherous, and had only prevailed by relying on Elder Qian Tong’s Shi to bully the weak.

Xie Yong and Xie Jun naturally did not believe that rubbish — there was no Saint King the Xie family’s Young Master couldn’t beat. Even one who had only just broken into the Saint King Realm would be easy pickings for trash like Xie Hongwen.

In the end they learned the truth from Xie Li.

That youth Yang Kai’s cultivation was low, but his combat power was not ordinary; he could kill Third‑Stage Saint King Realm warriors — a so‑called genius who could fight above his ranks.

But Xie Yong and Xie Jun were also elites — the Xie family’s elite disciples — and they had absolute confidence in dispatching Yang Kai.

“Do you think that trash might not have taken this path?” Xie Hongwen suddenly asked again. “We’ve chased for days and haven’t seen a trace. Did we go the wrong way?”

Xie Yong grinned and said proudly, “Young Master, rest assured — he took this road. No one can escape my tracking.”

It was precisely because Xie Yong excelled at tracking and had notable combat strength that he stood out among the Xie family disciples and secured this assignment.

After confirming Yang Kai’s entry point, the three used the Transmission Compass to rendezvous, then tracked Yang Kai’s steps all the way here.

“Then how did we not spot him?” Xie Hongwen asked, puzzled.

“Because he entered this valley,” Xie Yong pointed ahead.

Xie Hongwen’s face brightened. “Really?”

“No mistake.”

“Then what are we waiting for? Catch up and kill him!” Xie Hongwen’s expression turned fierce, but he immediately shook his head, “No, restrain him first — I want to torture him properly. Killing him outright would be too cheap; I’ll make him suffer every human torment.”

“Young Master, that may be unnecessary,” Xie Yong said with a strange look.

“What do you mean?” Xie Hongwen asked, slanting his eyes at him.

Xie Yong smiled faintly, “He walked into this valley — it’s ten deaths and no escape. No need for us to chase; he absolutely cannot come out alive. He’s likely already dead.”

“Why? How do you know?” Xie Hongwen grew even more bewildered.

Xie Jun chuckled and explained, “Before we came, the Family Head gave us information on the Flowing Flame Sandland. One item concerned this valley: during the last opening of the Flowing Flame Sandland a Xie family elder walked this path. Less than an hour after entering the valley he suddenly found countless fire spirit beasts gathered inside, surrounding a group who were locked in combat. That group were elite warriors from the major powers, more than thirty in number, and the fighting was fierce. Our elder didn’t want to be drawn in and quietly withdrew. After leaving the Flowing Flame Sandland and making inquiries, they learned the over thirty warriors trapped in the valley had not a single survivor, and they hadn’t even reached the heaven‑and‑earth treasure area.”

“They perished in the valley?” Xie Hongwen’s face changed; despite his earlier boasting he couldn’t help paling at the thought of countless fire spirit beasts surging in.

“Yes, they perished in the valley. Only our Xie family elder knew why, and apart from our family few should know of this valley. Yang Kai entering it means he cannot survive. I hesitated earlier because of that, but after confirming with Xie Yong the topography matched our elder’s account exactly — in other words, four hundred years ago our elder walked this very valley.”

Xie Hongwen slapped his hand hard and sighed, “What a pity — how did he come to die like that? I wanted to capture him myself.”

He lamented that he could not personally slay Yang Kai.
