## Chapter 292 — Zhongdu … Qiu Family

The changes in Lingxiao Pavilion could not escape the notice of the surrounding Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower.

In recent days, the Hu sisters had visited Lingxiao Pavilion multiple times, conversing with Su Yan and offering her comfort, while also inquiring about Yang Kai's news.

However, the others from Blood Battle Gang were not as cordial. Years ago, before the Inheritance Celestial Cave was opened, Meng Wuya had fought against Blood Battle Gang's ten Divine Roaming Realm experts, causing Blood Battle Gang to lose face. Many harbored resentment, especially Long Zaitian, who had suffered a severe injury during that battle and had yet to recover. With the recent upheaval in Lingxiao Pavilion, Long Zaitian had been contacting allies from all directions, eager to take advantage of the situation.

The gang leader, Hu Man, turned a blind eye, allowing Long Zaitian to stir up trouble.

Fengyu Tower was no different; they were eagerly taking in the disciples scattered from Lingxiao Pavilion while coveting the wealth accumulated by the sect over the years.

The current situation of the entire sect was akin to a person drinking water; they alone knew whether it was warm or cold.

“If the sect is disbanded, where will we go?” Su Yan sighed softly. Having lived in Lingxiao Pavilion her entire life, she had long regarded it as home. Now, with such sudden changes, even her normally indifferent temperament felt a pang of sorrow and confusion.

Yang Kai also smiled bitterly, gently pulling her into his embrace, their fingers intertwined, their foreheads touching as they breathed in each other's aura, their restless hearts gradually calming.

“If it really comes to that, we can go to Yao Wang Valley's Hidden Cloud Peak. Shopkeeper Meng and Little Junior Sister are there,” Yang Kai said softly.

With Xiao Fusheng's prestige, it would be no problem to protect a group of people.

Although he was from the Yang Family, he could not return home now, so he naturally could not give Su Yan any guarantees.

Su Yan nodded slightly, then suddenly smiled brightly, saying, “It’s been a long time since I saw Junior Sister Xia. You two are now…”

“Not yet,” Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly.

“Then you better put in some effort. Junior Sister Xia is like a fairy, innocent and pure. Don’t let her suffer any losses at the hands of other men,” Su Yan teased with a smile.

Yang Kai nodded, feeling a bit embarrassed.

At that moment, a wave of Divine Sense suddenly spread over, causing Yang Kai's expression to change slightly. He turned to look in a certain direction, his expression serious as he said, “An expert is coming!”

Su Yan immediately straightened her posture, a hint of worry flashing across her cold, beautiful face as she asked in a low voice, “Where?”

“Eh… don’t be nervous. It’s an acquaintance,” Yang Kai replied, his expression becoming strange.

He could sense that the incoming person was a Divine Roaming Realm expert; otherwise, they would not be able to transmit information with Divine Sense. However, the boldness with which the other party swept their Divine Sense over suggested that even the Divine Roaming Realm experts within Lingxiao Pavilion would notice.

Moreover, the fluctuations of this person's Divine Sense felt very familiar. Yang Kai should have seen this person before, but he could not discern exactly whose Divine Sense it was.

“Let’s go take a look!” Yang Kai listened intently for a moment. Hearing the sounds of many robes fluttering within the sect, he knew that Ling Taixu and the others were moving out. He immediately jumped down from the pavilion with Su Yan and flew in that direction.

Before they could get close, they heard Ling Taixu's voice calling from afar, “Which friend has come to Lingxiao Pavilion?”

A voice came from a distance, old and calm, “Sect Leader Ling, it’s been a long time!”

Hearing this voice, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and quickened his pace, soon arriving beside Ling Taixu, where the four elders had also gathered, standing behind Ling Taixu.

Seeing Yang Kai and Su Yan together, the expressions of several elders turned strange. Especially Su Xuanwu, who had long suspected that his granddaughter had something going on with Yang Kai. Now, seeing them together, he could not help but roll his eyes, especially since there was still a faint blush on Su Yan's cold face, which made the second elder feel even more uncomfortable.

He shot a fierce glare at Yang Kai, filled with a threatening aura!

Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly and remained silent.

In the distance, a figure quickly approached and stopped before everyone.

Upon seeing the person's appearance, Ling Taixu was surprised, “You are Feng Wei of the Dong Family?”

The newcomer chuckled and cupped his fists to everyone, saying, “Indeed, it’s this old man. I apologize for the abrupt visit, and I hope you all will forgive me.”

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly as he hurriedly asked, “Senior, has something happened?”

Feng Wei, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians of the Dong Family, had always been closely following Dong Qinghan to protect him. Now, his sudden visit to Lingxiao Pavilion clearly indicated that Dong Qinghan had important news to convey to him.

Feng Wei's expression turned serious as he nodded slightly and said, “Young Master Yang, my young master asked me to inform you to leave Lingxiao Pavilion quickly, or there may be great danger.”

“Is it because of the Evil Lord?” Yang Kai frowned, quickly grasping the situation.

Feng Wei was surprised, “So your sect has already made preparations.”

No wonder it was so desolate here; just now, when he released his Divine Sense, he did not sense many people present, which was vastly different from his last visit to Lingxiao Pavilion.

Ling Taixu nodded, “Naturally, we are prepared.”

Feng Wei said, “Then why are you still staying here? You all should hurry and leave; the people coming to Lingxiao Pavilion this time are not to be trifled with.”

“Who are they?” Su Xuanwu's expression darkened at the severity of Feng Wei's words.

“Zhongdu… Qiu Family!” Feng Wei replied solemnly.

“One of the Eight Great Families?” Wei Xitong and the others turned pale.

“Indeed, led by the Qiu Family, the Bai Family has also sent people, and additionally, there are those from Ziwei Valley. The three forces combined; let alone your Lingxiao Pavilion, even my Dong Family cannot afford to provoke them,” Feng Wei sincerely advised, “You all should not act recklessly; as long as the green hills remain, there is no fear of running out of firewood.”

With the Evil Lord incident at Lingxiao Pavilion being so significant, Yang Kai could understand why the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu would get involved. After all, it was a major matter that required a powerful force to take charge. However, the involvement of the Bai Family and Ziwei Valley was rather intriguing.

It was likely due to the last time Yang Kai fought Bai Yunfeng, which caused them to lose face, prompting them to come and take advantage of the situation.

“They are moving quickly; I rushed here and didn’t shake them off much. I estimate they will arrive here within half a day at most,” Feng Wei said hurriedly, then clasped his hands again, “The message has been delivered; this old man takes his leave!”

He could not stay here; if he were blocked by the Qiu Family, explaining would be troublesome.

After Feng Wei departed, a group of people was left in shock.

Wei Xitong hesitated, “Feng Wei of the Dong Family. Why is he so kind as to send us a message? Is there a trick behind it?”

Ling Taixu shook his head slightly, “No, Yang Kai has some connections with his young master. This message is given out of goodwill; there’s no need for suspicion.”

Upon hearing this, the four elders looked at Yang Kai in surprise, wondering what kind of ability he had to befriend someone like Dong Qinghan.

“Send the order down; everyone should quickly pack their things. Gather at the Dragon Confinement Ravine in one incense stick's time!” Ling Taixu decisively commanded.

After saying this, he added, “Yang Kai, you stay behind.”

“Oh!”

The four elders received the order and hurriedly left, leaving only Yang Kai and Ling Taixu.

“Do you still remember the location where I took you to cross the void last time?” Ling Taixu suddenly asked.

“I remember.”

“Good, just infuse True Yuan into that location, and the formation will activate on its own. You will take people to leave from there. I believe they won’t be able to catch up. After leaving, destroy that formation and find a place to settle down. Until the situation is clear, do not reveal yourselves…”

“Master, you’re not leaving?” Yang Kai sensed the hidden meaning in his words, his expression uncertain.

“My Lingxiao Pavilion has not done anything heinous. It’s just that I mistook someone and took in the wrong disciple; why should I leave?” Ling Taixu chuckled, “If I leave, it will only put Lingxiao Pavilion in a more disadvantageous position. I must stay and reason with them. After all, there is always a reason for everything. Just because the Evil Lord comes from my sect, does that mean my sect must be destroyed? Their families have also produced evil individuals; why hasn’t anyone destroyed them?”

“They are coming with great momentum and preparation; how could they reason with you?” Yang Kai exclaimed anxiously.

“No need to say more; my mind is made up!” Ling Taixu's expression was resolute, and he suddenly smiled confidently, “Moreover, even if a fight breaks out, I am not without opponents… hehe!”

Yang Kai's expression brightened as he exclaimed, “Master, you…”

“Indeed, this is all thanks to you!” Ling Taixu nodded slightly.

He had broken through to the Divine Roaming Realm! After more than a decade of shackles and constraints, they had finally been shattered before this great calamity. This might be the only piece of good news for Lingxiao Pavilion in recent months.

Upon learning that his master had broken through the Divine Roaming Realm, Yang Kai finally calmed down and ceased to persuade him, quickly setting off.

By the Dragon Confinement Ravine, all remaining members of Lingxiao Pavilion were gathering.

Yang Kai saw Su Mu and others once again; it had been nearly a year or two since their last meeting, and Su Mu had already cultivated to the Ninth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, his rapid progress drawing attention.

“Senior Brother Yang…” Su Mu shouted excitedly, followed closely by Li Yuntian and the others.

“Long time no see!” Yang Kai smiled at everyone. Aside from Su Mu, the others had all grown significantly and had reached the Qi Movement Realm.

“Hey, should I call you Senior Brother or Brother-in-law?” Su Mu grinned mischievously at Yang Kai, clearly aware of the relationship between Yang Kai and Su Yan.

“Call as you wish!” Yang Kai rubbed his nose.

“Brother-in-law, you’re really something!” Su Mu looked at Yang Kai with admiration, giving him a thumbs up and whispering, “I always thought my sister would be alone for life; I didn’t expect you to win her heart. Impressive, impressive! Tell me how you did it.”

Just as he was speaking, he caught two cold glances from Su Yan, causing Su Mu to involuntarily shrink his neck and tremble a few times, laughing awkwardly.

“Is everyone here?” Wei Xitong and Su Xuanwu were inspecting the area, calling out loudly.

“Where is the Sect Leader?” He Beishui asked.

“The Sect Leader is staying behind!” Yang Kai said solemnly.

“What?” Wei Xitong and the others' expressions changed drastically.

The four elders exchanged glances, each revealing a determined look.

Wei Xitong said, “Hehe, since the Sect Leader is staying, I will stay too. Junior Brother, you take everyone and leave quickly.”

Su Xuanwu smiled proudly, “Eldest Senior Brother, your words are incorrect. I will also follow the Sect Leader closely. Junior Brother, you take everyone and leave quickly!”

He Beishui chuckled, turning to You Zizai, “Fifth Junior Brother, you’re the youngest; this task falls to you.”

You Zizai looked around and saw no one younger than himself among the elders. He pinched his nose and said, “I will stay too.”
