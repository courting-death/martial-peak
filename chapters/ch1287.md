## Chapter 1287 — Who Is Su Yan

The three fellow disciples had pursued all the way here, thinking that bringing Yang Kai back to Liuli Sect would be an easy task. Yet one of them had perished in this place, and the remaining two were seriously wounded. Gazing at Yang Kai’s cold, indifferent face, Yin Sudie suddenly realized that she might have made a terrible mistake.

“Even if I were to overturn the very heavens, she would only stand behind me in support—never in front of me asking whether I would regret it.” Yang Kai suddenly spoke a line that left Yin Sudie utterly bewildered. A mocking smile curved at the corner of his lips. “A woman like you dares to take on her form? You truly do not know the meaning of courting death!”

As his words fell, a pitch-black blast of energy shot out and directly pierced Yin Sudie's delicate body.

Yin Sudie's complexion drained; she thought she was doomed this time, and two tears involuntarily slid down from the corners of her eyes.

Just now that pitch-black demonic flame had easily reduced Senior Brother Hou's body to ashes. Now it had penetrated her own body—how could she possibly survive? To her surprise, the flame was not scorching as she had imagined, but terribly cold. Once it entered her, she shivered uncontrollably; her Saint Yuan felt as if it had been frozen, moving sluggishly, and a layer of white frost quickly covered her.

“I won't kill you this time! If you dare cross me again, I'll make your life worse than death!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, flicked his hand, and the golden thread that had bound the man surnamed Luo flew back and dove into his body, vanishing.

Then, under Yin Sudie's complicated gaze, he strode off with Yang Yan.

Long after Yang Kai and Yang Yan's figures had disappeared, Yin Sudie and the man surnamed Luo dared to move. Though both were seriously injured, neither had fatal wounds; the Luo man had many broken bones but nothing life-threatening, while Yin Sudie's condition was worse—her Divine Sense had been harmed and that frigid cold current coursed through her meridians, making her miserable.

“Junior Sister... are you all right?” The Luo man forced himself to stand and asked with concern, reaching out a hand as if to help Yin Sudie up.

“Do I look all right to you?” Yin Sudie's pretty face contorted; she rudely slapped the man's offered hand aside and wobbled to her feet, her hair and ornaments in disarray—gone was any trace of her former grace.

Luo knew she was reproaching him for his incompetence, so even though he was angry inside, he dared not say more.

But then again, had he known how formidable that Yang Kai was, he would never have followed Yin Sudie here to intercept him; that would have been courting death. Thankfully Yang Kai hadn't finished him off—otherwise he would now be joining Senior Brother Hou on the road to the next world.

He still couldn't understand why Yang Kai had killed only Senior Brother Hou—was it to set an example?

“Junior Sister, shall we find somewhere to rest? We're not far from Myriad Beasts Mountain; disciples from Myriad Beasts Mountain often pass through here. If they see us, it could stir up trouble.” The Luo man asked gently while Yin Sudie straightened her clothing. Although she had shown him a cold face earlier, he dared not ignore her; if he did, he'd be in for trouble when they returned.

Hearing this, Yin Sudie's expression cleared slightly and she nodded. “Mm, let's find a place to recuperate first. We also need to discuss how to report this to the elders at the sect when we return.”

Luo paused and then nodded, “As you wish, Junior Sister.”

The two forced themselves up and, dragging their injured bodies, searched for a concealed spot nearby to sit and heal.

......

Thousands of li away, in another place, Yang Yan silently followed behind Yang Kai, steering her Star Shuttle as they sped in a certain direction. As she gazed at his back, she couldn’t help but feel that there was a trace of loneliness and desolation in that figure. Ever since parting ways with Yin Sudie and the others, Yang Yan had noticed a subtle change in Yang Kai’s mood—he had remained silent the entire journey, flying straight ahead as though lost in some lingering thought.

She didn't disturb him, only quietly followed.

She knew Yang Kai's change likely had something to do with the secret art Yin Sudie had used in those final moments and with the name of a woman he shouted.

After a full day and night of travel, Yang Kai suddenly shifted his posture and descended onto a nearby small hill, and the lonely aura that had been on his back abruptly vanished.

Yang Yan guided her Star Shuttle to land beside him, glanced at his profile and saw he had indeed returned to normal. She secretly exhaled, eyes turning as she asked, “Who is Su Yan?”

“Why do you ask that?” Yang Kai glanced back at her.

“Just asking.” Yang Yan pouted—she immediately realized Yang Kai did not want to talk and didn't press him. Even without his words, she could guess that Su Yan must be the most important woman in his life.

She didn’t ask, yet Yang Kai suddenly felt inclined to speak. Smiling faintly, he said, “She is my true Senior Sister—unlike you, the fake one.”

“And you two...” Yang Yan smirked as if she'd discovered something significant; her smile was suggestive.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded calmly. “But I don't know where she is within the Star Domain right now.”

“She isn't on Dark Star?” Yang Yan was startled.

“No. My coming here was an accident. She entered the Star Domain earlier than I did; I don't know exactly where she is.”

“I see... are you worried about her?” Yang Yan asked softly.

“Worried. I want to find her quickly, but I don't even know when I can leave Dark Star.” Yang Kai sighed gloomily. “For now I can only cultivate until my strength is enough; then I can leave Dark Star and go into the outside world to search.”

Yang Yan rolled her eyes as if about to say something, but thought better of it and swallowed her words. She waved a hand, “Never mind that—you're looking sad. Tell me, why didn't you kill the other two? You didn't do it because one was a woman, did you?”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “If I could, I'd have killed them all, but Yin Sudie's position in Liuli Sect is different. If I really killed her, Liuli Sect would not let it slide. And others must know they came out this time; without that layer of reason, I wouldn't mind silencing them.”

“If that's the case, you shouldn't have only killed one of them.” Yang Yan frowned—she had seen the fight with Hou and Yin Sudie and thought either you don't kill at all or you kill thoroughly; killing only one seemed like a loss.

Yang Kai smiled, “I killed him because he tried to kill me, nothing more.”

As for whether Liuli Sect would hold a grudge, Yang Kai didn't care. It was inevitable they would be displeased after a disciple died at his hands, but that Hou was of lower standing than Yin Sudie; so even if some trouble came, it wouldn't draw the attention of the sect's higher echelons. Anyone who came after him would only be a handful, and with Dragon Lair Mountain's present defenses, he had no reason to fear much.

Besides, the Xie Family has already set its sights on him—one more enemy or two wouldn't matter.

Besides, which great sect doesn't see a few mishaps and deaths among its disciples every year? If they always stirred up trouble over every lost disciple, they wouldn't be able to develop themselves.

So killing that man didn't weigh on Yang Kai's mind.

In this battle he not only tested the power of the Golden Blood Threads, but also the soul technique derived from the Warm Spirit Lotus.

The Blooming Lotus Secret Art was the soul technique he comprehended when the Warm Spirit Lotus finished evolving.

One trial proved Yin Sudie utterly could not withstand it.

But though Blooming Lotus's might was great, its toll on him was also significant; it consumed a lot of Divine Sense. Yang Kai judged the gains and losses and decided this soul technique should be used as a surprise move.

Now that he possessed the Space Blade, the Blooming Lotus, the Golden Blood Threads, the World-Ending Demon Eye, Demonic Flame that could shift between hot and cold, and other esoteric methods, along with the Hundred Mountains Painting, Purple Shield, a Void King-Grade refining furnace and an Artifact Spirit as treasures, even as merely a Second Stage Saint King, Yang Kai had confidence to face typical Origin Returning Realm opponents.

Whether he could win depended on the other side's cultivation level.

Yet the cold Leng Qing of Star Emperor Mountain and Lu Ye of Floating Cloud Valley still left Yang Kai without absolute confidence. Especially the former—he seemed extremely dangerous, not in the least inferior to him.

Of course this couldn't be proven, since they hadn't actually fought.

After all these messy thoughts, Yang Kai suddenly asked, “Where are we now?”

“Thinking to ask now?” Yang Yan pouted. “Why didn't you think of this when we were slogging through yesterday?”

Yang Kai showed an awkward expression. He had been stirred by Yin Sudie's secret art the day before; though nothing obvious happened then, memories surfaced afterwards. After a day of adjustment, however, his mood had returned to normal.

Yang Yan chuckled, “It's fine—we haven't strayed far from our intended destination. If we go now it's only a slight detour; at most it delays us three days.”

“That's good.” Yang Kai nodded lightly. This trip wasn't only to Liuli Sect; there was something else to do, otherwise Yang Yan wouldn't have tagged along.

“But before that, shouldn't you let Xiaoxiao out so I can see how much Thousand Illusions Glaze it swallowed?” Yang Yan suddenly excitedly proposed.

Although Yang Kai had summoned the Stone Puppet back the night before, both had been cautious and hadn't checked. Now they finally had the time and opportunity, and Yang Yan couldn't wait to find out.

Seeing this, Yang Kai nodded slightly and sent out his Divine Sense to probe the nearby area. When he confirmed there were no others within dozens of li, he waved his hand and summoned the Stone Puppet.
