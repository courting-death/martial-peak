## Chapter 976 — Shattering the Soul

Surrounded by a ring of Bone Shields, Ke Luo trembled with extreme anxiety.

Han Fei materialized at his side, an ice-crystal longsword dancing in her hand, forming a shimmering curtain of light that enveloped him.

The moment she made a move, Li Rong moved just as swiftly.

The leader of the Ancient Demon Clan struck like a battering ram; her pink fists swung in rapid succession, paying no heed to the Bone Shields beside Ke Luo, crushing them as she barreled through, shattering countless Bone Shields until she stood directly before Ke Luo and raised her fist to strike.

A burst of force erupted, imbued with a profound intent to annihilate all living things. 

Ke Luo’s face drained of color as he tried to defend, but Changyuan’s peerless long halberd had already pierced through—he was beset on both front and back, overwhelmed, only able to narrowly evade while meeting Li Rong’s blow.

Boom…

The earth shook and mountains trembled; the thunderous impact deafened the ears, and the newly formed flesh body of Ke Luo could not withstand such a violent strike—cracks spread inch by inch.

Chu Lingxiao’s Locking Demon Chain followed the momentum and coiled around his body, binding his freedom.

Other experts seized the moment and surged forward together, unleashing a full-force bombardment on Ke Luo.

Ke Luo was battered into a wretched state, his body split open with cracks as chunks of flesh were blasted away. What emerged beneath—his bone body, the vessel of his life essence and very foundation of his existence—was laid bare before everyone’s eyes.

Crack…

The bone frame could not withstand the successive assaults of ten top experts; fissures cracked across it, dense as a spiderweb.

Ke Luo was finished!

This time it was truly over.

He had counted on the Bone Race’s forbidden art, the Blood Pool Flesh Forest, to net the experts of Tongxuan Continent, but at the last moment Yang Kai destroyed it; bereft of that forbidden art, Ke Luo was no match for ten experts.

From every quarter he was tightly suppressed—he had no hope of victory.

Ke Luo’s jade-green eyes rolled with anger and frustration. Rage and unwillingness intertwined; Changyuan’s long halberd drove through his skull, piercing and bursting those eyes.

Blood and flesh flew. Ke Luo stilled where he stood, no longer moving.

The next instant it was as if he was dismembered—his body detonated, and the bone frame collapsed utterly.

A faint, illusory figure burst from Ke Luo’s mind, rapidly contracting into a speck of radiance before streaking off into the distance.

“His soul has left the body!” Meng Wuya barked.

With both flesh and bone destroyed, Ke Luo decisively sent his soul out of the husk, hoping only to preserve that soul from annihilation.

Without a vessel, no matter how powerful, soul energy cannot remain in this world for long—unless one uses certain special Secret Treasures to preserve it, or finds a suitable body to take over.

Di Mo was a perfect example.

If Ke Luo could find such a chance and a suitable body, given the Bone Race’s strangeness, he might rise again—returning with renewed force.

But would ten experts give him that opportunity? They had been guarding against precisely this moment.

As Meng Wuya’s shout fell, ten streams of Divine Sense erupted, surging to pursue Ke Luo’s escaping soul.

In an instant a howl of agony, born from his soul, rang out; his Spirit Body hovered in midair, its half-transparent face contorted and terrifying, emitting an extremely dangerous aura.

Sensing the odd state he was in, the ten experts dared not press further; instead they enveloped Ke Luo with their own soul-forces, preventing any further escape.

A battle of souls is perilous—one mistake and the soul itself can be damaged, a cost no one could bear.

Everyone feared Ke Luo, like a trapped beast, would fight desperately and pull someone down with him before dying.

If a powerhouse of Ke Luo’s caliber were driven to desperation and detonated his soul, none present could withstand it.

“Stop tormenting me, or I’ll take you all with me!” Ke Luo howled hysterically, the aura pouring from his Spirit Body growing ever more volatile, seeming ready to explode at any moment.

The ten experts all frowned, privately feeling the situation had become thorny.

“Ke Luo!” Yang Kai’s angry shout cut through the air.

At the call, Ke Luo turned his gaze to Yang Kai and immediately realized his peril. As he glimpsed the golden demonic eye, an immense, invisible vortex suddenly formed before him, unleashing a terrifying suction he could not resist, drawing his Spirit Body toward it.

Ke Luo struggled desperately, but to no avail; he flailed as if trapped in a quagmire—the more he fought, the faster he sank.

Whoosh…

In a single instant the soul that had given ten experts such trouble was sucked into Yang Kai’s left eye; the lingering echo in everyone’s ears was Ke Luo’s unwilling roar and his wailing dying cry.

The crowd stood agape.

Before anyone could ask after Yang Kai, he had already closed his eyes and sat cross-legged on the ground.

Within the Sea of Consciousness Yang Kai’s Spirit Body manifested; Ke Luo hovered above the sea, eyes full of dread as he surveyed his surroundings and felt the scorching heat within those waters—his face shifted several times as he cried out in shock, “Special Soul Energy? You actually possess Special Soul Energy?”

With his eyesight he could naturally see the extraordinary power of Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

It was a Divine Sense with scorching, fiery intensity.

Even across the starry void, those who possess such special Divine Sense power are exceedingly rare; Ke Luo had not expected that in this lowly continent there would be someone with it.

“Today I’ll scatter your soul!” Yang Kai wasted no words; the moment his Spirit Body manifested he poured the entire power of his Sea of Consciousness forward, burning at Ke Luo’s Spirit Body.

At the same time, the World-Ending Demon Eye suspended above the Sea of Consciousness reappeared, and a strand of golden light shot out from that demonic eye.

Ke Luo screamed and struggled, utterly defenseless; under the force of Divine Sense Fire and the Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light, all of his lifetime’s consciousness and memories were purified away, leaving only a mass of pure soul energy.

Yang Kai reached out and drew that soul energy in, feeling its surging power and being slightly moved.

Truly befitting a powerhouse about to ascend to the Saint King Realm—the soul energy was far greater than any Yang Kai had obtained before.

Above the Sea of Consciousness, clusters upon clusters of pure energy floated without end.

These were the energies Yang Kai had inadvertently absorbed during the entire battle.

Whenever someone died near him, that person’s soul energy would be drawn in—this was not something Yang Kai could control.

Yet because of it, he had reaped unimaginable benefits.

He did not hurry to leave. After all, the major outcome had been decided: the Bone Race had been annihilated, and the remaining task was to clear the field and count the dead and wounded.

Yang Kai began to absorb that countless energy.

Most of these energies belonged to Transcendent Realm cultivators, and not a few were of those who had already reached the Saint Realm.

Each energy carried the deceased’s comprehensive insights into Heavenly Dao and martial cultivation, unique training perceptions.

Yang Kai culled and refined these, turning them into nourishment for himself.

Gradually, his consciousness approached a great gate; he pushed it open and peered into the world beyond.

His mind quaked violently; the Sea of Consciousness churned. The whole body erupted with terrifying energy fluctuations.

Outside, those who sat in meditation sensed Yang Kai’s change, blinking open their eyes in alarm as they looked toward him.

A moment later Li Rong’s delicate body trembled; she cried out, “Master is about to breakthrough!”

Meng Wuya stared in a daze. “Isn’t it too fast?”

He had previously asked Li Rong about the time Yang Kai’s True Yuan had transformed into Saint; he knew that had occurred only a year ago.

He estimated that even with stellar talent, after True Yuan became Saint-level it would take at least two to three years to truly catch sight of the Saint Realm threshold.

Whether one could break through would also depend on one’s personal fate.

Yet now, in only a year, Yang Kai was already beginning to break through.

He was on the verge of entering the Saint Realm.

Meng Wuya found it hard to accept, staring at Yang Kai as if looking at a monster, muttering something under his breath, his face showing the blow to his pride.

He considered himself also endowed with heavenly talent, but compared to Yang Kai he felt a loss of confidence.

“It certainly looks like he’s going to break through,” Chu Lingxiao said with a slight smile, relief showing on his elderly face. “Seems he gained much from this battle. Well, we should give him space and not disturb him.”

Saying so, he deliberately took a step back.

The demon and yao contingents did not linger either; once they had all moved far away, only Li Rong and Han Fei remained until the end.

They still did not fully trust the demon and yao experts; although everyone cooperated against the Bone Race, now that the matter was settled no one would dare guarantee they would not seize the opportunity to strike Yang Kai down in his growth.

Thus Li Rong and Han Fei kept watch, wary.

After a long time, many of the three-race experts returned from all directions; they hunted down Bone Race remnants, pursuing without mercy, burning every fleeing Bone Race member to ashes to prevent any chance of revival.

Half a day later all the survivors gradually returned and the three races began to tally their losses.

The result was grim: thousands of experts had come, but after the battle only five hundred remained.

Nearly half of the masters had perished on this land, many of them Saint Realm cultivators.

Although this battle removed lingering threats from the continent, all races were grievously depleted of Yuan Qi; the demon race suffered the most—two demon generals fell in the fight against Ke Luo, a blow even Changyuan could not withstand. The living—Xueli and Meng Ge—were equally desolate and heavy of heart.

Most sorrowfully, the dead left almost no flesh; their blood-and-flesh essences vanished, leaving only piles of bones—no one could tell who they had been in life.

The three races joined forces to gather the remains of the fallen, placing them upon an island of the Water Divine Hall as a small gesture of solace.

Powerful figures from all sides performed rites to honor those who had given their lives in this great war.

A day later, the winds and clouds in the sky shifted, and terrifying forces of Heaven and Earth came crashing down from above, making the land tremble.

“Yang Kai has broken through!” On the island Meng Wuya’s eyes lit up as he shouted in a low voice.

“Let's go look.” Chu Lingxiao said, then flew off in that direction; the yao and demon groups swiftly followed.

The human-side experts who heard the news were also filled with curiosity and hurried over to observe.
