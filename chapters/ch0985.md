## Chapter 985 — Chaos Abyss

After a round of probing, Yang Kai's face sank like still water.

He discovered that, without his awareness, he had come into a forbidden region of the starry void.

Even experts who had reached the Saint King Realm would not dare to step here; every correct route marked on the star charts steered far clear of this place.

The beautiful stars around, while glittering with alluring light, also hid tremendous danger.

That danger was not only the chaotic domain field that could make one lose their way, but something more terrifying. The woman had not told Yang Kai within the divine-sense light orb what that horror truly was, yet Yang Kai knew all too well it was a peril that could cost him his life.

He once more fell into a state of bewildered helplessness, not knowing where to go.

After absorbing and summarizing the information the other had left, Yang Kai stood where he was and pondered for a long while, then guided the Star Shuttle to begin seeking a way out.

He did not want to give up—he had only just arrived in this vast starry void and had yet to see its true wonders.

Time passed; he fixed on a direction and, without restraint, expended his strength, pressing forward in relentless flight.

But it seemed there was no end—no matter how long he sped, he remained surrounded by countless beautiful stars.

He even couldn't help forming the illusion that he was circling around a point, endlessly tracing large loops!

The chaotic domain field warped his sense of direction and position, so what he believed to be the correct course often turned out to be futile effort.

Stars flickered, the starry sky stretched vast and boundless, and Yang Kai did not know how long he had been wandering there.

Perhaps one or two months, perhaps half a year—he had no sense of the passage of time.

Long enough for his cultivation to steadily advance. In that dense energy environment he surged toward the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, his strength increasing faster than he had imagined.

He finally found some small joy that soothed the unease in his heart.

Quietly he thought that staying here might not be as bad as he had imagined. If he continued to search, sooner or later he would find a way out.

One day, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the Star Shuttle, letting it fly on while he meditated to cultivate.

At that moment his mind was calm like water, no longer as tense as at first. Since he could not find a way out for now, he might as well take the chance to improve his strength; he believed such a cultivation environment was rare even within the entire starry void.

If his strength grew enough, he could break the shackles and illusions of this chaotic domain field.

Two not-insignificant fluctuations of spirit and two life breaths suddenly impressed upon his perception.

It was the two sisters he had encountered earlier!

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes; his expression turned odd.

He had not expected to see them again; they seemed likewise unable to find a way out, lost within this Chaos Abyss.

At present they rested on a huge meteor, not rushing onward, allowing the meteor to carry them forward aimlessly.

They were the only living beings Yang Kai had met along the way, and a peculiar sympathy for their shared plight rose in him.

After thinking it over, he guided the Star Shuttle toward the meteor where they sat.

A moment later Yang Kai stepped onto the meteor and looked about; he did not spot them, but not far off he found the mouth of a cave.

What were they hiding in there? Yang Kai frowned.

He strode to the cave entrance and called aloud, "You're in there, aren't you?"

"Come in and speak!" the elder sister's voice answered. From the life breaths of the newcomer they had judged Yang Kai's identity, so they were not on guard.

Yang Kai bent and entered the cave, going deep inside through winding turns until he saw two indistinct figures sitting cross-legged, leaning against each other.

At that moment the two women's spirits seemed low; Yang Kai faintly felt that the sister called He Miao was particularly despondent, as if despairing from being lost in this Chaos Abyss.

"We meet again," the elder sister nodded lightly to Yang Kai.

"Indeed." Yang Kai grinned, though it was not a cheerful matter. "What are you hiding here for? Is there any danger?"

"No danger — we just don't want to waste our strength and Saint Yuan. Haven't you noticed that hiding here you don't need to exert power to resist the starry sky's force?"

Hearing that, Yang Kai came to realize and, feeling carefully, discovered that the starry sky's force permeating the starry void truly could not penetrate here; staying here made things markedly easier.

"Our Saint Crystals and Pills are used up, so we can only hide here," He Miao said softly. This meeting she was not as impish as before; her expression was gloomy.

"Used up?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"We've been lost here a long time," the elder sister explained. "If we go out and can't find a way, when our power is exhausted what waits for us is death."

"You two are truly miserable…" Yang Kai understood their plight and couldn't help feeling some sympathy.

"What are you gloating about…" He Miao sniffed, her tone sour.

"Am I?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"You are!"

"Say what you will. So what are you planning to do now? Keep hiding like this?"

"What else can we do?" The elder sister's beautiful eyes regarded Yang Kai with complexity. "We are not like you; our bodies are not sturdy and robust — without using power we cannot resist the starry sky's force."

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh, not knowing what to say.

In the darkness He Miao's eyes brightened and she said, "Right — you aren't afraid of the starry sky's force. So you don't need Saint Crystals or Pills. Do you happen to have any extra Saint Crystals or Pills? If so, would you sell… um, lend us some?"

She wore an expectant look, as if discovering a new hope, her beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai.

The elder sister was also roused by her words; her expression instantly turned hopeful.

"I don't have Saint Crystals," Yang Kai shook his head.

The two sisters simultaneously frowned, secretly cursing Yang Kai a stingy man who did not know how to win a beauty's favor.

"But I have Crystal Stones. I also have some Pills," Yang Kai added.

"Crystal Stones? Low-grade Crystal Stones?" The elder sister was startled. "Crystal Stones will do; better than nothing."

"Then would you be willing to lend us some?" He Miao looked pitiful.

"Giving you some is fine." Yang Kai pondered. After all, he did not need them out here, and he could continually draw energy from the surroundings to bolster his cultivation.

"Wonderful — you're truly a good person!" He Miao rejoiced, her face alight.

"But what can you give me in return?" Yang Kai asked.

He Miao's joy froze; the elder sister asked warily, "What do you want?"

In the dark Yang Kai's gaze flowed over the two sisters as he thought.

He really did not know what to ask of them to make up for his losses.

"Forget it." The elder sister's face darkened, her attitude changing; coldly she said, "Never mind — we'd rather keep hiding here."

"Stinky man!" He Miao scolded coquettishly, her beautiful eyes glaring fiercely at Yang Kai, full of vigilance. "Careful — we might team up and give you a beating!"

They clearly misunderstood Yang Kai, thinking he intended to take advantage of them.

Yang Kai shook his head and smiled. He took out some Crystal Stones and Spirit-Grade Pills from the Demon God's Secret Codex and placed them before the sisters. "Consider this a loan."

He did not take out many Crystal Stones. The Pills were only Spirit-Grade Pills; he did not produce any Saint Pills, even though he possessed many.

After all, he and these two women were mere chance acquaintances; there was little bond between them. If he truly offered Saint Pills or too many Crystal Stones, it might stir covetousness and prompt the sisters to turn on him.

He had to remain cautious.

Yang Kai's gesture left the sisters stunned, not understanding why he had suddenly become so accommodating.

The elder sister's icy look showed signs of thawing; she said somewhat apologetically, "If we have the chance, we'll repay you tenfold."

"Then I wish you luck." Yang Kai smiled. "I must continue searching for a way out; I won't bother you further."

Saying that, he turned and headed out of the cave.

Just as he was about to leave, the elder sister's voice came from behind: "We are people of the Sword Alliance; my name is He Zao, my sister is He Miao!"

"I'll remember; may we meet again," Yang Kai replied.

After Yang Kai departed, He Zao and He Miao exchanged a sidelong glance. He Miao said, "What a strange person — he didn't even tell us his name. Does he not know manners?"

"At least he's not a bad person." He Zao gazed at the Crystal Stones and Spirit-Grade Pills before her, a trace of gratitude on her face.

"He really must have come from a remote place — these Crystal Stones and Pills are so low-grade they won't replenish much power," He Miao pouted, criticizing what Yang Kai had left behind.

"Be grateful. With these we can at least explore for another month or two without worrying about running out of power. Though hope is slim, we cannot give up. Our Master may already be searching for us; if she can bring people, we might not die here."

"I miss Master so much; I will never come to this damned place again."

"If not for being chased by the people of Purple Star, we would not have fallen into this plight, let alone plunged into the Chaos Abyss."

"Do you think the Purple Star people will pursue us? They certainly won't let us go."

"It's possible — after all, that thing is still in our hands. How infuriating; we don't know how the news leaked."

"There must be a traitor within the alliance," He Miao said flatly.

"Set that aside for now; in this situation staying alive is the most important thing."

The two sisters spoke as they carefully stored the Crystal Stones and Pills.

Items they would once have glanced past — these low-grade supplies — had now become their last hope; they dared not waste them.

After a brief recovery in the cave, once their vigor and spirit reached its peak, the two sisters left the cave and set off in a direction completely different from Yang Kai's, seeking the slightest chance of life and a way out.
