## Chapter 475 — The Grand Gift

Leng Shan was after all a rising star of Ghost King Valley. Although her memory was not perfect, she was still clear about who she had met before.

Especially considering how powerful this Master Di was, if she had truly met him before, how could Leng Shan have forgotten?

Yet she simply could not remember.

And this sense of familiarity was not visual, but rather a feeling.

If she thought about it deeply... the impression this Master Di gave her was somewhat like that despicable Zi Mo from Tianlang Kingdom!

She and Zi Mo shared a peculiar bond because Yang Kai had left a mark on their souls; that was why a strange sense of kinship existed. Why then did this Master Di give her the same feeling?

He was so strong; surely he wasn’t also marked by Yang Kai within his soul? Leng Shan shook her head secretly, feeling her conjecture was rather unreasonable.

Master Di chuckled and replied, “I have seen you before, but you have not seen me.”

Leng Shan was even more confused and didn’t press the matter further.

“All right, let’s talk as we walk. War City is only about eight hundred li from here; we should arrive before nightfall!” the expert surnamed Di gestured and led the way.

The members of Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect exchanged uncertain glances.

Wu Yan hesitated for a long while before biting the bullet and saying, “Then let’s follow.”

This man was terrifyingly powerful. Regardless of his inexplicable aid, if he truly wished to kill, with the methods he had just shown, he could have instantly wiped out everyone here.

It was a blessing, not a curse. Since it couldn’t be avoided, it was better to comply with his will for now. The truth would naturally reveal itself once they reached War City.

More than thirty people followed Master Di with anxious hearts.

After walking a short distance, the middle-aged man suddenly turned around and beckoned to Leng Shan. “Little girl, come here!”

Leng Shan responded and stepped forward, but Shen Yi warned urgently, “Junior Sister, be careful!”

“Mm,” Leng Shan said calmly, carrying no worry. She walked over and proceeded side by side with the middle-aged man, respectfully asking, “Master, what do you instruct?”

“Heh heh,” the man looked at her with a twisted smile. “Relax.”

Leng Shan didn’t know what he intended, but she suddenly saw him open a large hand and reach out to grab her. She instinctively wanted to resist, but true essence hadn’t even condensed when the man withdrew his hand.

A chilling, agonized shriek echoed as she looked sharply, her expression changing.

She saw that the Ghost King Seal inside her body was actually pulled out. The illusory shadow soul writhed and struggled in the man’s hand, howling uncontrollably, yet unable to break free.

Ghost King Valley possessed a martial skill all disciples could cultivate—the Ghost King Seal.

It was a spirit born in the Ghost Formation Land. Captured and refined inside their bodies by disciples through special arts, it was constantly nourished and grown alongside its host with Primordial Qi.

When facing enemies, it could launch surprise attacks.

In essence, a refined disciple of Ghost King Valley could take on two foes as if it were two against one.

However, Leng Shan and the other young disciples had yet to cultivate the seal to its full power and were unable to unleash its entire might.

Never before had anyone forcibly pulled the spirit of the Ghost King Seal from a disciple’s body. And yet, this expert surnamed Di had done exactly that.

Leng Shan hadn’t felt a thing.

Just as she was about to question him, the middle-aged man spat out a puff of black mist, striking the Ghost King Seal spirit.

The howling spirit seemed to receive immense nourishment, instantly calming down. Instead of restless agitation, it appeared to relish it, its grotesque features showing profound satisfaction.

Leng Shan was stunned, swallowing the words she wanted to say.

“Returning it to you!” The man smiled slightly and let the spirit return to Leng Shan’s body.

“Junior Sister!” Shen Yi, having witnessed the scene with indignation, rushed forward angrily, glaring at the middle-aged man as he protected Leng Shan.

“Quite bold!” the middle-aged man sneered.

“I’m fine! Senior Brother, you misunderstand. This Master just did me a great favor!” Leng Shan quickly explained.

“Explain!” Shen Yi looked uncertain.

“My Ghost King Seal had gone into hibernation,” Leng Shan said.

“What?” Shen Yi’s eyes nearly popped out.

The Ghost King Seal spirit evolved alongside its host, like a snake shedding its skin. Every time it hibernated and awoke, its strength improved immensely.

Strictly speaking, Leng Shan’s spirit had already evolved three times. The next evolution should occur when she advanced to the Divine Roaming Realm, at which point the spirit’s power would rival ordinary Divine Roaming masters.

But now—this evolution, supposed to happen at least a year or two later, was forcibly advanced.

Leng Shan even felt this evolution would bring about earth-shattering changes; this was no ordinary hibernation evolution.

And all because Master Di spat that black mist.

“Thank you, Master,” Leng Shan said gratefully.

“No need. Consider it your reward for going to assist Yang Kai. Treat your spirit well. When it awakens, it will develop intelligence and become your most loyal companion,” the expert surnamed Di earnestly advised.

“Develop intelligence...” Seven or eight disciples of Ghost King Valley gaped in disbelief.

The spiritual body of the Ghost King Seal could indeed develop intelligence—this was no empty claim. Records of Ghost King Valley confirmed such occurrences, but only centuries ago, with an elder who reached beyond Divine Roaming Realm.

Even the current Valley Lord Gui Li’s spirit had not developed intelligence.

Everyone then realized what a precious gift this was.

Leng Shan’s face flushed with excitement, biting her lip speechless for a moment before softly inquiring, “Master Di, what is your relationship with Yang Kai?”

“He is my young... my Young Master!” The man nearly let the secret slip with a sudden cough.

“So, you are from the Yang Family?” Leng Shan’s eyes brightened.

“Hmm, that’s hard to say,” the man answered ambiguously.

“Master! Master!” Shen Yi shamelessly approached, bowing low with a servile face. “We—like Junior Sister—are here to assist Yang Kai as well, so...”

The middle-aged man glanced at him and said coldly, “You think evolving your spirit is as simple as blowing some Qi? It costs my cultivation.”

Shen Yi’s face darkened, feeling embarrassed and unwilling to give up, trapped and miserable.

If he cultivated himself, his spirit could never evolve intelligence or become legendary no matter how long he trained. Here lay a golden opportunity that might never return.

Yet the man’s words left him speechless.

Suddenly, the man’s tone softened. “But I’m in a good mood today. Fine, I’ll help you youngsters.”

Life twisted again, and Shen Yi was overjoyed, thanking profusely as he waved to the others behind, “Come, come, all of you!”

The rest of the disciples from Ghost King Valley eagerly approached, calling “Master” repeatedly with flattering smiles.

The man did not hesitate, pulling each disciple’s Ghost King Seal spirit out and breathing Qi into it before returning it.

Before long, the task was completed.

The seven or eight disciples exchanged looks full of excitement and anticipation. Earlier, the Master claimed he hadn’t felt much. But now, with the spirit returned, all sensed this evolution would bring a qualitative leap forward, inspiring dreams and hope for the future.

They had made a huge gain without even reaching War City or seeing Yang Kai. Encountering an expert related to Yang Kai midway and receiving such a grand gift was a priceless opportunity. Once in War City, living alongside this Master, with his guidance, their futures would be bright.

The opportunity for Ghost King Valley’s disciples stirred the envy of the Baoqi Sect members.

Tao Yang even eagerly approached with a sly grin. “Master, Master, we’re here to help Yang Kai too. Do you happen to have... heh heh...”

“What do you want?” The man asked with a smile, not annoyed.

Tao Yang grew serious. “Is there a way to enhance the purity of my True Essence? It’d be best to raise it one or two levels!”

Artificers and alchemists required high purity and condensation of True Essence. Tao Yang, not a Ghost King Valley disciple, was an artificer by trade, naturally wishing for enhancement on this front.

The man scoffed coldly. “That I cannot help with. That depends entirely on your own effort.”

“Oh...” Tao Yang was somewhat disappointed.

“But... I heard you are from Baoqi Sect?”

“Yes.”

“In terms of refining, I can offer some guidance, heh heh. But I don’t know if you will comprehend it.”

Wu Yan sneered disdainfully.

Though this man was powerful and eccentric, no one in the world could rival Baoqi Sect in refining, not even Divine Roaming masters beyond.

He naturally didn’t take the man seriously, thinking him full of hot air.

“Master, you understand refining?” Tao Yang’s eyes lit up.

The expert surnamed Di nodded lightly. “A little, not deeply. But enough to guide you.”

Now even Tao Yang’s expression turned strange, unsure how to respond.

For someone to dare show off refining knowledge in Baoqi Sect was truly laughable.

Since the man’s methods were cruel, if he lost face, he might fly into a murderous rage. Resigned, Tao Yang could only swallow his pride and humbly seek instruction, indulging this man’s desire to show off, giving him a graceful way out.
