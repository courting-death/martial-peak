## Chapter 2554 — I’ll Wait for You on the Yellow Springs Road

If not for the Soul-Devouring Worms consuming much of the Ghost King’s power, and if not for his own incredibly strong body, this blow would likely have taken his life.

His life was not in danger, but the wound was truly shocking. Especially around the injury, pitch-black energy coiled, hindering Yang Kai’s recovery and corroding his flesh.

This was the Ghost King’s chilling power, extremely difficult to dispel.

“He… he’s not dead?” Yin Lesheng’s eyes widened in disbelief as he cried out. He simply couldn’t believe how tough Yang Kai’s body was, and that strange secret technique just now—he’d clearly seen a dragon’s head and felt genuine dragon might.

Could that really have been a Divine Spirit?

At this thought, Yin Lesheng’s legs began to tremble for no reason.

“I… I can’t hold on much longer,” Lin’er gritted her teeth and whispered.

Given her meager cultivation, it was already remarkable that Lin’er could wield the Taiyi Jade Cinnamon Bowl, an Imperial Treasure, for so long. She was nearly at her limit, and after being shaken by the dragon’s might, her spirit was in turmoil. Now, her Origin Qi was depleted, and she simply couldn’t hold out any longer.

Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen were shocked at her words, no longer daring to delay. They simultaneously urged their Emperor Yuan, once again controlling the Ghost King to attack.

It had taken the young lady’s power to bind Yang Kai, turning him into a target. If they still couldn’t kill him, then death awaited them all.

“You all must die!” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed coldly as he struggled with all his might.

With a few crisp snaps, the branches binding his limbs were broken.

Lin’er cried out, seemingly suffering backlash. The pure white barrier instantly retracted, transforming back into a crystal-clear jade bowl that flew to her and disappeared into her body.

Without the suppression of the Imperial Treasure, Yang Kai suddenly felt the pressure lift, his whole body invigorated.

Only now did he realize that the pure white barrier was actually formed by an Imperial Treasure.

The Ghost King lunged ferociously, but Yang Kai acted as if he hadn’t seen it, his expression solemn. Emperor Yuan surged through his body like a tide as his hands rapidly formed seals.

“The years wither and flourish, like a shuttle, like a dream!”

As the Great Emperor of Time’s divine ability was unleashed, time seemed to freeze in that instant.

The seals thundered toward Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen. The two stared ahead, completely unaware.

It seemed like only a moment, yet also like countless years.

When their eyes regained clarity, the seals were already upon them.

Yin Lesheng’s face was filled with terror as his hands moved frantically. Essence-Blood spurted from his mouth as he shouted, “Senior Uncle, hold on!”

No one knew what secret technique he used, but he slipped away like an eel, fleeing backward at high speed. At the same time, his vitality rapidly waned, and his newly advanced Emperor Realm cultivation plummeted…

This secret technique seemed to inflict great harm on himself.

“You…” Hua Feichen was beside himself with grief and rage.

Others didn’t know what Yin Lesheng had done, but Hua Feichen understood perfectly.

Yin Lesheng had clearly severed his own cultivation, abandoning his connection to the Netherworld Infernal Banner. In doing so, he avoided the backlash of the myriad ghosts, but he was also giving up years of cultivation in the Netherworld Sect.

Everything would have to start over, and there was even a risk of damaging his foundation.

He had come at his junior nephew’s request, bringing over twenty disciples to help eliminate an enemy. Yet now, at this critical moment between life and death, that same junior nephew had abandoned him on the battlefield, leaving him to take the fall alone.

What could be more frustrating than this?

Hua Feichen nearly spat blood in anger, cursing the Netherworld Sect for raising a traitor. How had he never seen it before? Truly, distance tests a horse’s strength, and time reveals a person’s heart. If he had a choice, he’d rather meditate in the sect than get involved in this mess, risking his life.

These thoughts hadn’t finished turning when the Years Like a Shuttle seal struck him.

Thanks to his resistance, Yin Lesheng managed to escape.

Before their eyes, Hua Feichen’s skin aged, his vitality rapidly draining as if centuries of time flowed over him…

“Despicable!” Hua Feichen spat, glaring in the direction Yin Lesheng had fled, cursing through clenched teeth. His head suddenly lolled to the side as he collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath.

The Power of Time corroded his body, leaving him powerless to resist. Death was only a matter of time.

Without his control, the Ghost King suddenly went berserk. Its eyes burned red like coals as it swung its massive scythe wildly.

“Ah…”

A dozen screams rang out at once as the remaining Netherworld Sect disciples collapsed, black energy erupting from their bodies like flames.

They had clearly suffered backlash, with no hope of survival.

Yang Kai ignored them and the now-uncontrolled Ghost King, only casting a cold glance toward Lin’er and snorting, “I’ll deal with you later!”

Lin’er shivered under his icy gaze, truly frightened, yet she stubbornly glared back at Yang Kai, refusing to back down.

Yang Kai’s figure flickered as he chased after Yin Lesheng.

“Miss, run!” Elder Fu’s forehead was drenched in cold sweat as he hurriedly sent a secret message.

If she didn’t run now, she might never get another chance. Two Emperor Realm masters from the Netherworld Sect had joined forces, backed by more than twenty disciples, and even summoned the Ghost King—yet they still couldn’t deal with Yang Kai. Instead, he slaughtered them all.

This Yang Kai fellow’s strength was simply overwhelming.

He truly hadn’t lost unjustly in Desolate City. With the power Yang Kai displayed, killing him would be as easy as crushing an ant.

“Run?!” Lin’er retorted angrily, “I’m right here. I want to see if he dares touch me.”

She was mostly speaking out of anger. In truth, no one dared harm her, and besides, her legs were weak—she couldn’t run even if she wanted to.

Elder Fu was anxious. “Miss, can’t you see he’s gone berserk? If you get hurt, how will I answer to the master?”

Lin’er snorted, “Even if he had a hundred and eighty times the courage, he wouldn’t dare try it.”

Elder Fu was at a loss. Yang Kai had been wounded by the Ghost King because of the young lady’s interference, and his wound was still bleeding. He surely wouldn’t let her off easily. Elder Fu’s earnest persuasion was useless, and he didn’t dare use force on her, leaving him as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.

Meanwhile, Yin Lesheng hadn’t gotten far before Yang Kai caught up.

Yang Kai was skilled in space power, making pursuit his specialty. Besides, Yin Lesheng’s strength had plummeted, his aura weakening, nearly at the edge of the Dao Origin Realm—he couldn’t outrun Yang Kai.

He glanced back as he fled, only to see Yang Kai trailing him like a specter, his face so cold it seemed to radiate frost. While giving chase, Yang Kai mocked him, “Running? Let’s see where you think you can escape to!”

Knowing escape was impossible, Yin Lesheng steeled himself. Suddenly, an object appeared in his hand. Gritting his teeth, he turned to unleash its power.

But in that instant, he was startled—Yang Kai was already standing before him, coldly staring at the item in his hand.

Before Yin Lesheng could activate it, Yang Kai swung the Myriad Sword.

With a swish…

Yin Lesheng’s arm flew off, blood gushing from the stump like a fountain.

Yang Kai reached out and snatched the item from his grasp, glanced at it, and snorted, “Emperor Extinction Pill! I knew it should be this damned thing!”

Back in the Shattered Star Sea, he’d suffered a major loss to the Wenqing Sect’s Young Sect Master Feng Xi, and knew that disciples from such sects always carried treasures bestowed by elders.

The Emperor Extinction Pill was the most common.

Though difficult to refine and consumable, having one at hand could turn the tide at a critical moment.

Back in the Shattered Star Sea, Feng Xi nearly killed Yang Kai with an Emperor Extinction Pill gifted by his father.

Once bitten, twice shy—Yang Kai was on guard against Yin Lesheng, never giving him a chance to use the pill, and simply chopped off his hand.

“Ah…”

Only now did Yin Lesheng, his arm severed, realize what had happened. He stared at his stump, screamed in agony, staggered back, and collapsed, his face ashen.

Zing…

A cold gleam flashed as Yang Kai descended from above, gripping the Myriad Sword. He looked down at Yin Lesheng, the sword tip pressed right against his nose. The blade’s aura flickered like a serpent’s tongue, threatening and unpredictable.

Yin Lesheng’s scream abruptly stopped. He swallowed nervously, terror written all over his face.

He knew he’d lost, and lost utterly. Even if Yang Kai spared him, he’d never be able to cultivate again. He’d used a forbidden technique to sever his own cultivation, damaging his foundation. Now his strength had fallen to the Saint King Realm and was still dropping.

“To be honest, we never had any deep hatred,” Yang Kai said, letting blood drip from his chest to the ground, his face expressionless. “You brought this on yourself.”

If he’d just stayed in the Netherworld Sect to consolidate his realm and let go of his grudge with Yang Kai, he might have inherited his master’s mantle and led the sect one day. But instead, he brought people here to ambush Yang Kai.

One wrong step leads to another.

Yin Lesheng let out a sinister laugh. “The path of Martial Dao is full of tangled rights and wrongs, grudges and gratitude—who can truly say what’s clear? I lost today, but who’s to say you’ll reach the peak tomorrow? What are you so proud of?”

“Maybe so.” Yang Kai nodded in agreement. “But I can go farther and see more than you.”

Yin Lesheng’s mouth twitched, unable to reply.

“Any last words? Let’s hear them!” Yang Kai asked indifferently.

Yin Lesheng gritted his teeth, “I’ll be waiting for you on the Yellow Springs Road…”

“Still so stubborn!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, nudging the sword tip forward. “Believe it or not, I won’t kill you—I’ll rip out your soul and refine it.”

Yin Lesheng immediately shut his mouth, not daring to speak further.

Sometimes, death wasn’t the worst fate. Worse was living in agony.

Yang Kai tilted his head, grinned, and said, “Just kidding.”

As he spoke, the Myriad Sword sank slightly and slowly pierced forward.

Yin Lesheng’s eyes widened in that instant, clearly hearing the Myriad Sword stab into his body, piercing his heart. That slow, terrifying sensation instantly enveloped him.
