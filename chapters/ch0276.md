## Chapter 276 — You Shouldn't Speak, It's Embarrassing

At the Hidden Cloud Peak of Yao Wang Valley, Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan were searching for medicinal herbs in the forest, carrying their medicine baskets.

The task assigned by Elder Xiao this time was not difficult to complete. The medicinal herbs were neither precious nor rare, and they could be found growing among the various peaks.

The only requirement was a somewhat strict age limit.

At the very least, they needed to be over thirty years old.

The two of them trekked through the mountains, carefully searching, and only managed to collect a fair amount by the afternoon.

“We're still short one Iron Bone Grass. Aunt Xiang said we need to gather ten stalks to have enough,” Dong Qingyan said, counting on her fingers, her brows slightly furrowed. “Cousin, we haven't found a single one.”

Yang Kai scanned the surroundings and suddenly had an idea. “There probably isn't any of that herb on Hidden Cloud Peak. Let's go check other places.”

Dong Qingyan's eyes sparkled as she giggled. “Are you suggesting... a place like Dan Sheng Peak?”

Yang Kai shot her a glare.

Understanding each other without needing to say more, the two of them headed towards Dan Sheng Peak.

Dan Sheng Peak was a forbidden area of Yao Wang Valley. Ordinary disciples were not allowed to approach within three hundred zhang from the peak's summit. However, below that height, they could enter freely.

With a clear purpose, the two of them walked straight to Dan Sheng Peak.

“Let's split up to search,” Yang Kai said with a light cough.

“Mm.” Dong Qingyan nodded with a smile. She naturally understood what Yang Kai intended to do and did not point it out, only reminding him, “Be careful.”

“I know.”

Carrying the medicine basket, Yang Kai casually approached the top of Dan Sheng Peak, while nonchalantly searching for Iron Bone Grass and keeping a vigilant watch for any movements around him.

Half an hour later, as Yang Kai intentionally or unintentionally drew closer, he was almost within a hundred zhang of the peak.

Quietly looking up, Yang Kai was astonished to find a stone statue standing atop Dan Sheng Peak. This statue was the likeness of Dan Sheng.

The statue was at least thirty zhang tall, exuding a grand momentum. Even from a hundred zhang away, Yang Kai could still see the area above the statue's chest.

The statue was weathered and worn, and it was unclear how many years it had stood there. Despite the wind and rain, it remained steadfast.

Yang Kai wanted to release his Divine Sense to investigate further but hesitated.

Although he could not see anyone at the moment, there must be powerful guardians present.

“Earth Demon, can you quietly sneak in and check the situation?” Yang Kai inquired through a message.

“If there are experts from the Divine Roaming Realm up there, I would have nowhere to hide,” the Earth Demon replied.

His current strength was not too high, and he could not conceal his demonic aura. Moreover, his features were too obvious, wrapped in the Soul-Breaking Spike, which was a black aura. There was no way to evade the attention of experts from the Divine Roaming Realm.

Is there really no way? It had been over a month since arriving at Hidden Cloud Peak, and he still had not figured out what secrets lay hidden there.

“Who goes there!” Just as Yang Kai was frowning in thought, a furious shout suddenly came from above.

A figure swiftly descended from above, landing directly in front of Yang Kai, looking at him with a cold expression.

This person was definitely an expert from the Divine Roaming Realm, and their strength was not low. Although most disciples in Yao Wang Valley were alchemists, there were always some experts responsible for combat and defense.

“Which peak's disciple are you? Do you not know that the area below three hundred zhang of Dan Sheng Peak is a forbidden zone?” the person scolded coldly, their expression unfriendly.

Yang Kai frowned and quickly thought.

“I'm asking you a question! Which master do you serve? Hasn't anyone told you what the consequences are for trespassing on Dan Sheng Peak?”

Yang Kai then clasped his fists and said, “I pay my respects, Senior. I am a disciple of Elder Xiao from Hidden Cloud Peak, sent down the mountain today to gather some medicinal herbs.”

“Elder Xiao?” The person was taken aback, then suddenly realized, “You are the young man who just joined Hidden Cloud Peak a month ago?”

“Indeed, that's me!”

The person cautiously scrutinized Yang Kai from head to toe, and after a moment, their Divine Sense swept over him before retracting.

The cold expression gradually softened.

Yang Kai added, “I was so focused on searching for herbs that I didn't realize I had come this far. I hope Senior can forgive me.”

The person nodded and said, “If it were any other disciple, they would face death for this offense, but considering your short time in the sect, today’s mistake can be forgiven. Leave quickly, and do not let it happen again. If it does, you will be severely punished!”

Yang Kai had no choice but to retreat.

After Yang Kai left, the person’s figure flickered and returned to the top of Dan Sheng Peak to continue their watch.

From a distance, Yang Kai glanced back.

There truly were experts from the Divine Roaming Realm guarding the area. What should he do now? If there were a way to approach Wan Yao Pool, he might catch a glimpse of the secrets within. Now, he couldn't even get close, let alone anything else.

Feeling depressed, he walked back. From afar, he heard Dong Qingyan arguing with someone, and his pace quickened. In just a short while, he could clearly hear her voice.

“This Iron Bone Grass was clearly discovered by me first. How can you do this?” Dong Qingyan's tone was somewhat aggrieved.

Another voice replied, “Junior Sister, you jest. This herb belongs to Yao Wang Valley collectively, so whoever picks it first owns it. Moreover, if we follow your logic, then all the herbs in this mountain were discovered by us first since we have lived here since childhood.”

“Who are you calling Junior Sister?” Dong Qingyan retorted angrily. “I am a disciple of Master Xiao. By seniority, all of you should call me Senior Aunt!”

“Cough, cough...” The three young disciples of Yao Wang Valley, who were confronting Dong Qingyan, looked embarrassed and found themselves unable to retort.

Elder Xiao had taken in disciples later in life, so although Dong Qingyan was quite young, her seniority in Yao Wang Valley was higher than most, on par with Qin Ze, making these young men feel inferior.

“What? Do a few of you want to snatch something that my Senior Aunt has set her sights on?” Dong Qingyan said triumphantly.

“What Senior Aunt...” the leader muttered discontentedly. “It’s just luck that you were able to enter Master Xiao's sect. If Master Xiao would let me try that Poison Pill, I could also pass the test.”

“Hmph!” Dong Qingyan wrinkled her delicate nose. “It’s useless to say these things now. Hand over the medicinal herbs that my Senior Aunt has set her sights on, or I will tell your master that you all... have disrespected your elders!”

As she spoke, her voice suddenly rose significantly.

The faces of the young disciples of Yao Wang Valley changed. They could not bear the weight of such an accusation. In Yao Wang Valley, only Hidden Cloud Peak had more lenient rules, or rather, it was completely free, while the other peaks had many strict regulations. The accusation of disrespecting elders was not something to be taken lightly.

However, these young men were all older than Dong Qingyan and were men, so they were unwilling to back down in front of this little girl.

The leader's eyes turned, and a plan formed in his mind. With a sneer, he gritted his teeth and said, “Since my Senior Aunt is a disciple of Hidden Cloud Peak, she must be a talented alchemist!”

“Of course!” Dong Qingyan was immensely pleased. The little girl was also obsessed with alchemy, and being praised for her beauty was not as satisfying as being praised for her alchemical skills. Upon hearing this, she immediately became proud.

“Is my Senior Aunt looking for Iron Bone Grass?” the leader asked again.

“Yes!”

“The quantity of Iron Bone Grass in Yao Wang Valley is also dwindling. May I ask how many stalks my Senior Aunt needs?”

“I need ten stalks, but I’ve only found two...” 

“How fortunate! We have gathered quite a bit of Iron Bone Grass here, it should be enough for what my Senior Aunt needs.”

“You're willing to give it to me?” Dong Qingyan's expression brightened, and she suddenly found these young disciples quite charming.

The leader chuckled, “Of course, it won’t be given for free... However, if my Senior Aunt would like to use these Iron Bone Grass as a wager, we can have a friendly spar. If my Senior Aunt wins, not only will we give the Iron Bone Grass, but any other medicinal herbs my Senior Aunt desires can also be taken. What do you think?”

Dong Qingyan frowned at this suggestion, her lips pouting in thought.

Just when she was unsure of what to do, Yang Kai's voice came from the side. “Who wants to spar? I’ll accompany you!”

“Yang Guard!” Dong Qingyan's expression brightened as she waved at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai flashed over to Dong Qingyan's side and looked at the three young disciples of Yao Wang Valley. “You want to spar?”

“Yes, he is another disciple who passed the test and also joined Hidden Cloud Peak!” one of the Yao Wang Valley disciples gritted his teeth, his face filled with envy and jealousy, wishing he could take Yang Kai's place.

“Bullying a woman is not a skill. If you have something to say, come at me,” Yang Kai said, glancing at the three.

Yang Kai's boldness immediately ignited the competitive spirit of the three disciples from Yao Wang Valley. The leader said, “Fine. Since you have this intention, I’ll let you see my skills!”

“Wait a moment!” Yang Kai raised his hand to signal. “You just said that Iron Bone Grass would be the wager. Is that still valid?”

“Of course it is!”

“Then that’s settled.” Yang Kai nodded. “You three can come at me together.”

The three were taken aback, exchanging glances.

“Please enlighten me!” Before Yang Kai's words had even finished, he had already lunged forward. The three alchemists from Yao Wang Valley only saw a blur, followed by a series of crashing sounds. All three were sent sprawling, letting out cries of despair.

“So weak?” Yang Kai frowned, a look of doubt on his face.

He had thought that these people were so arrogant, they must have some skills, but unexpectedly, they couldn't even withstand a single blow. The attacks he had just unleashed were merely a test, using only fifty percent of his strength.

“You... how could you hit someone!” the alchemist who had spoken earlier fell to the ground, trembling as he pointed at Yang Kai, his face filled with indignation and despair.

“Stop talking nonsense!” Yang Kai sneered. “It’s a spar; what’s the point if you don’t hit?”

Without further ado, he stepped forward and overturned the three's medicine baskets, collecting all the Iron Bone Grass inside.

“Yang Guard, let’s hurry and leave!” Dong Qingyan's face was flushed as she pulled Yang Kai along, hastily making their way back to Hidden Cloud Peak.

“You're bullying too much!” came the cries from behind, filled with grievance and sorrow. “I’ll tell Master Xiao and have them punish you!”

“Why are they like this?” Yang Kai frowned. “Didn’t they say they wanted to spar? They lost and are still shouting, how weak.”

“Cough, cough...” Dong Qingyan's face turned even redder.

“Why are we running? Those Iron Bone Grass were their wager; winning them is only natural. It’s not like we robbed them.”

“You shouldn’t speak; it’s so embarrassing.”
