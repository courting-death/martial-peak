## Chapter 1590 — Blood Prison

A heavy, dizzying sensation assailed him from every direction, as if the very fabric of space had slipped and collapsed.

This was the telltale sign of spatial teleportation!

For Yang Kai, short-range teleportation no longer affected him in the slightest, but this ultra-long-distance transfer—from one Cultivation Star to another—still posed a certain burden.

Fortunately, he was well-versed in Spatial Force; with a slight circulation of his Saint Yuan, he dispelled the many negative effects cleanly.

In a flash, Yang Kai found himself standing on an unfamiliar land.

Before he had time to take in his surroundings, he sensed a life aura not far away.

He turned his head warily and discovered the man to be Lie Feng from the Kuang Shi domain, only about one hundred zhang away from him.

The other man had arrived earlier, yet he looked utterly disheveled, as if he had not fully recovered from the teleportation.

Lie Feng had not cultivated Spatial Force like Yang Kai, so he naturally recovered more slowly from the transfer’s negative effects; still, he was a promising yao, already at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. After about three breaths, he suddenly opened his eyes, a sheen of martial light flashing forth; like Yang Kai, he probed cautiously, his Saint Yuan quietly circulating, ready to act against any lurking danger.

In the next moment, he caught sight of Yang Kai a hundred zhang away.

"Eh…" Lie Feng displayed a look of surprise, paused for a moment, then strode over to Yang Kai with a swaying step and asked with a smile, "I heard your name is Yang Kai?"

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded lightly, his tone cool and indifferent.

"I also heard you gave Xue Lian a lesson?" Lie Feng seemed quite interested in him.

Yang Kai did not answer.

Lie Feng shrugged. "I heard it from Yu Xiong. Pity I couldn't get to Chi Yue's domain sooner—would've been quite a show. Heh, between you and me, I don't much like that Xue Lian fellow either, but you teaching him a lesson is surprising. Humans really shouldn't be underestimated. Hmm, I think I can invite you to join me."

"Invite me to do what?" Yang Kai asked skeptically.

Lie Feng carried himself with an easy familiarity and a friendly manner that kept Yang Kai from feeling any immediate dislike.

"Invite you to act together," Lie Feng said with a smile. "Brother Yang, as you know, this is Cuiwei Star; my fellow yao who come here rarely receive good treatment. Looking around, it seems there are only you and me nearby. If we join forces, our safety would surely increase considerably."

"Sorry. I'm not interested!" Yang Kai shook his head and refused.

"Why not?" Lie Feng frowned.

"Because I'm human! I won't be singled out here." Yang Kai pointed at himself, then at Lie Feng. "You're a yao. If someone who hates yao sees me with you, won't they attack me too? I don't want to bring trouble on myself."

"Uh…" Lie Feng was taken aback, scratched his head and said, "That's reasonable. If Brother Yang feels that way, then forget it—my consideration was lacking."

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

"Then I wish you luck, Brother Yang—I'll take my leave first!" Lie Feng showed no anger at being refused; he chuckled, picked a direction at random and hurried off.

He was brisk and straightforward.

After he left, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and cautiously scanned the area.

A moment later his expression shifted; he hastily withdrew his Divine Sense.

The intelligence provided by Shan Qingluo had been accurate—within the Blood Prison it was unwise to casually spread Divine Sense.

Although there were no restrictions here on releasing Divine Sense, this peculiar ancient battlefield was riddled with countless Domain whirlpools.

These Domain whirlpools were remnants left behind from battles between Void King Realm experts tens of thousands of years ago; some had dissipated, while others had undergone transformations over the river of time, becoming even more terrifying.

Such Domain whirlpools could swallow anything, including Divine Sense!

Yang Kai had just taken a small hit—if he hadn't withdrawn his Divine Sense in time, he would likely have suffered grievous injury; even so, his mind throbbed sharply like a needle.

It was a sign of Divine Sense damage, but with the Warm Spirit Lotus nourishing his spirit, Yang Kai did not worry much about this minor harm.

"Looks like I've truly arrived in the Blood Prison," Yang Kai murmured as he looked around.

Only within the Blood Prison would such bizarre Domain whirlpools exist.

The previous generation's Red Moon Domain's Lady had indeed been a prodigy—she had forged a Great Space Array that linked the Blood Prison with Di Chen Star.

Unfortunately, the distance was too great to permit precise positioning, so Yang Kai had found only Lie Feng nearby; where the other yao newcomers had been sent was unknown.

Yang Kai trusted Shan Qingluo's abilities; after all, she had inherited the primordial power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, and ordinary cultivators of the same realm were no match for her.

Added to that was the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip he had given her, which greatly bolstered her combat strength.

The only slight concern was her seductive appearance—that might become the main cause of trouble for her.

Her allure was such that few men could resist it…

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai shook his head and did not dwell further.

Qingluo had her own path to walk; Yang Kai knew he could not look after her forever. Even after so many years apart, she had survived well—and he trusted she would continue forward.

Choosing a direction at random, Yang Kai slowly flew on.

He did not dare move too quickly—the Blood Prison’s strangeness he had only heard of secondhand; he had not experienced it firsthand, and this place was undoubtedly a graveyard for Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts.

Yang Kai could be invincible beneath the Void King Realm, but he still treated the Domain powers of the Void King Realm with caution; he had no desire to die before his mission had begun.

The journey presented no major setbacks, though several lingering Domain whirlpools in the Blood Prison caught Yang Kai's interest for study.

Unfortunately those whirlpools were not particularly strong and their mysteries remained vague; he probed them with Divine Sense for a long time but gained little, and eventually abandoned the effort.

He did not therefore become complacent—he knew countless dangers lurked here and could not underestimate the Blood Prison just because of a few weak whirlpools.

Along the way he sensed several life auras, and even saw a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator flash past several hundred zhang away from him.

Thankfully, the Blood Prison had only just opened; no unpleasant types were eager to stir up trouble yet, and most still kept a rational head. When conflicts could be avoided they were, so the few auras Yang Kai detected purposely steered clear of him.

One day later, Yang Kai stood with a grave expression on a clearing, gazing straight ahead at a spot one hundred zhang away.

There, a middle-aged man in a blue robe was drenched in blood. The Saint Yuan surging from his body flickered weakly, his situation clearly dire. A watery veil of defensive Secret Treasure enveloped him completely, shrouding his entire form.

He continuously exerted himself, casting various secret arts in an attempt to flee the spot.

But they had little effect; the space seemed calm yet was as if congealed, pinning the man fast—no matter how he strained, he could not take a step.

In the void, streams of light kept darting about like blades and swords, cutting at the man’s defensive Secret Treasure and eroding its might.

The fellow had inadvertently blundered into a Domain whirlpool!

And it was a powerful one, capable of easily imprisoning a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert.

Panic contorted his face; feeling death drawing near, he strained his Saint Yuan even more.

Suddenly he saw Yang Kai staring from not far off and his eyes lit up as if he had grabbed at a life‑saving straw. He cried out, "Friend, save me! I accidentally got swept into this Domain whirlpool and can't get out—please, show compassion and help!"

Yang Kai frowned and gave no reply.

Though he bore no ill will toward the man, the whirlpool’s enervating power made Yang Kai wary; he would not risk himself for a stranger.

His presence there was only to probe the secrets of that Domain whirlpool.

Seeing no response from Yang Kai, the middle‑aged man grew desperate and, thinking Yang Kai cold‑hearted and unwilling to save him, shouted, "Friend, I am Xu Dingyang, Lord of Qingyu Sect on Chi Lan Star—please lend aid. If you free me, I will reward you handsomely; Qingyu Sect will be forever grateful."

"Chi Lan Star?" Yang Kai's expression shifted—he vaguely recalled hearing of that Cultivation Star, though he could not immediately place it. He shook his head and said slowly, "Friend, it's not that I don't want to save you, it's that the whirlpool's power is somewhat alarming."

Xu Dingyang's face darkened; though he showed reluctance, he knew Yang Kai spoke the truth.

For a moment there was little to say.

"Hold on, I'll see if I can think of something," Yang Kai replied coolly.

It wasn’t out of genuine goodwill that he wanted to save the man. Setting aside what kind of temperament this Xu Dingyang had—Yang Kai knew nothing about him. Even if he were a kindhearted person, having entered the Blood Prison, he should already be prepared to die.

If he died here, no one could blame anyone else.

Yang Kai’s offer was merely an excuse—he wanted to step into the whirlpool and probe deeper.

He wished to better understand how Void King Realm Domain power functioned.

Xu Dingyang clearly misunderstood Yang Kai’s intent and rejoiced, "Good, good—then I must thank you in advance. Be careful, friend; this whirlpool seems to fuse multiple Domain powers together and is extremely hard to deal with!"

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly and took a step forward.

In that instant, his face changed in alarm—he felt the surrounding space congeal, and myriad different profound intents pressed upon him, forcing his Saint Yuan to contend with them.

A hissing sound rose, and Yang Kai’s robe was instantly sliced by several cuts; the invisible Domain power seemed intent on exterminating any life that dared intrude. A single step could mean the difference between worlds.

Not daring to slacken, Yang Kai hurriedly circulated his energy to resist and summoned forth a Purple Shield, which blossomed into a purple radiance to guard him.
