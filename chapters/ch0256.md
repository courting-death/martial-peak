## Chapter 256 — White Mist Enshrouded Forest

In mid-air, a roll was executed, and Chi Xue landed steadily. He then looked at his Demonic Beast, which was now facing him, emitting a series of low growls from deep within its throat, its eyes flashing with fierce light.

Chi Xue's expression changed dramatically.

This Demonic Beast, which he had planted a Control Soul Insect in, was actually breaking free from his control and showing hostility towards him!

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai laughed triumphantly, his laughter wild and unrestrained.

Chi Xue glanced at him, recalling his strange actions moments ago, and growled menacingly, “What did you just do?”

Remembering that flickering light, Chi Xue suddenly realized that this person had desperately rushed over just to cast a flickering light at his Demonic Beast, which must have had significant implications.

Otherwise, his Demonic Beast would not have undergone such a change.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, sweeping away his previous caution, his spirit soaring as he strolled forward, reaching the side of the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast, patting its back, and looking down at Chi Xue, “What did I do? Can’t you see?”

Zi Mo's small mouth formed a round shape as she looked at Yang Kai in shock.

The more she interacted with him, the more mysterious he seemed. This person's strength and strangeness had exceeded Zi Mo's imagination.

Only at this moment did Zi Mo understand why, during the battle with the Demonic Beast a few days ago, he was able to resolve the crisis between her and Leng Shan. Although she had known he was behind it, she hadn’t fully grasped the intricacies at that time.

But now, Zi Mo finally understood that this man… could actually control Demonic Beasts!

Easily controlling a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast, such a heaven-defying method, who could rival it? Even her Senior Brother Chi Xue had sacrificed over a hundred Control Soul Insects, risking great danger to have them devour and fuse into higher-tier Control Soul Insects, and then abandoned dozens of powerful Demonic Beasts just to subdue the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast before them.

In comparison, Yang Kai's methods were simply unfathomable!

“How did you do it? My Control Soul Insect is still inside it. This is impossible!” Chi Xue finally lost his composure, desperately trying to communicate with the Control Soul Insect, but he could not make the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast obey him.

“Nothing is impossible; it can only be said that your insects are too weak!” Yang Kai sneered disdainfully, his expression cold.

“Interesting!” Chi Xue's expression suddenly brightened, as if he had encountered something novel and amusing, his gaze fixed on Yang Kai, his eyes flickering with fierce battle intent.

“Kill!” Yang Kai uttered a single word.

The Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast charged towards Chi Xue like the wind. As it rushed forward, wind blades continuously shot out. Chi Xue's figure flickered, his movements surprisingly exquisite. He did not engage in a direct confrontation with the Demonic Beast but instead leaped into the air, executing a reflection. Like an eagle striking through the sky, he pounced down towards Yang Kai.

Although Chi Xue was powerful, he could not possibly contend with the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast head-on. His target was only Yang Kai; as long as he killed Yang Kai, the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast would still fall under his control.

Descending from above, Chi Xue unleashed a grand and forceful attack, fully activating his True Essence Realm Seventh Stage strength, containing astonishing destructive power.

Yang Kai's expression grew serious. The Primordial Qi within him was also pushed to its limits. Instead of dodging this strike, he planted his feet firmly on the ground and charged towards Chi Xue.

“You're quite interesting!” Chi Xue grinned wickedly.

“You're not bad yourself!” Yang Kai laughed heartily in response.

In the midst of their verbal sparring, their hands did not hold back, engaging in a fierce clash without any embellishments. This strike saw both of them exerting their full strength without reservation.

Chi Xue aimed to use a thunderous method to kill Yang Kai, hoping to regain control over the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast.

Faced with such an attack, Yang Kai naturally did not dare to hold back.

As their fists clashed, a dull sound erupted in mid-air, shaking the eardrums and causing the energy of heaven and earth to become chaotic. Two muffled groans rang out simultaneously.

Chi Xue was sent flying backward, while Yang Kai crashed to the ground like a meteor.

With a thud, Yang Kai created a small pit in the earth. As he got back up, he couldn't help but spit out some blood, while Chi Xue, after landing, had only a slight flush to his face and was otherwise unharmed.

In this exchange, Chi Xue had the upper hand.

Even so, a trace of disbelief flashed in Chi Xue's eyes as he looked at Yang Kai, astonished. Before he could fully assess Yang Kai's condition, a series of wind blades came rushing at him.

Chi Xue cursed loudly and hurriedly dodged.

This was the attack of a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast; he could hardly withstand it a few times.

“You…” Zi Mo exclaimed, completely unsure of what to do.

“Don’t worry about it!” Yang Kai shouted, knowing she was in a dilemma and would not force her to help. He unfolded his steps and charged straight towards Chi Xue.

Chi Xue's expression changed, and he no longer dared to linger, fleeing in panic.

He had thought Yang Kai would be an easy target; as long as he killed Yang Kai with one move, he could turn the situation around. However, he did not expect this person to be so powerful, matching him in the Separation and Union Realm Eighth Stage level, and only sustaining minor injuries.

With no way to take Yang Kai's life in a short time, and with the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast falling into enemy hands, and his Junior Sister not coming to aid him, Chi Xue had no choice but to flee for his life.

Seeing Chi Xue escape over a hundred zhang away, Yang Kai naturally would not relent, directly flipping onto the back of the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast and swiftly giving chase.

Zi Mo hesitated for a moment, biting her lip, and then gritted her teeth to follow.

Her life and death were still in Yang Kai's hands; how could she not care?

In the forest, three figures darted forward one after the other.

Chi Xue was at the front, moving at great speed, while Yang Kai rode the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast closely behind. A few li away was Zi Mo, leading her dozen or so Demonic Beasts, her expression conflicted as she struggled to keep up while also wanting to flee, unable to make up her mind, her speed neither fast nor slow.

As they rushed forward, the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast displayed its might, unleashing wind blades that shot towards a hundred zhang away, causing sturdy trees to fall like wheat. The strength of the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast was evident.

This was a Demonic Beast powerful enough to rival the Divine Roaming Realm!

Although Chi Xue was fleeing, he did not appear flustered, only showing some anxiety between his brows. He was worried that if he continued running like this, he would eventually exhaust his True Essence. In contrast, that Great Han martial artist did not seem to worry about such issues at all. If he were cornered, he would truly be unable to escape.

Unbeknownst to him, Yang Kai was equally troubled.

The Slave Beast Seal was indeed strange and powerful, but he had only used it on Fourth-Tier and Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts before, never on a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast.

Previously, he had speculated that the Slave Beast Seal could not be invincible and should have limitations in strength, but he had never had the opportunity to verify it. Now that he tried, it was indeed the case.

Yang Kai was currently at the Separation and Union Realm Eighth Stage level, which roughly equated to the peak of Fourth-Tier in terms of Demonic Beasts.

This level of Slave Beast Seal could easily control Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts, and he could also control most Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts, but when it came to the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast before him, it was not as effective.

The Demonic Beast's subconscious was resisting the Slave Beast Seal he had implanted within it!

Although it still obeyed his control and commands, Yang Kai estimated that it would take at most an hour before the Slave Beast Seal would be shattered. At that time, this Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast would once again fall under Chi Xue's control.

The situation was dire; he had to resolve the battle within an hour, or else there would likely be complications!

Yang Kai was also unsure whether using the Slave Beast Seal twice in succession on a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast would have any effect. If it did not work…

With this thought, Yang Kai continuously issued commands to the Demonic Beast beneath him.

This Demonic Beast was now quite obedient. After sensing Yang Kai's intentions, its speed suddenly increased, gradually closing the distance between it and Chi Xue.

After a stick of incense, Chi Xue, in a hurry, glanced back and nearly couldn't help but curse!

The distance that had originally been a hundred zhang had now been reduced by about fifty zhang. If this continued for another stick of incense, he would be caught up.

“Are we going there?” A sudden thought flashed through Chi Xue's mind, his expression hesitating as he found himself indecisive.

That place was shrouded in mist, and he could not see what was inside. It was a location he had stumbled upon a few days ago.

Chi Xue had intended to explore it, but at that time, the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast had shown clear fear of that location. Coupled with Chi Xue's own vague unease, he had abandoned the plan to explore.

However, now that the pursuers were getting closer, he had no chance to escape. Chi Xue had to entertain the thought of taking a risk.

With the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast and the strength of that Great Han martial artist, he could not contend with them. If the Demonic Beast was afraid of that place, it would definitely not dare to enter. If that Great Han martial artist ventured in alone, Chi Xue would have a chance to win.

With this thought, a cold light flashed in Chi Xue's eyes, and he made up his mind.

After observing the terrain for a moment, he suddenly turned and sped towards that mysterious location.

After another stick of incense, the distance between Yang Kai and Chi Xue had closed to ten zhang.

So close that not only could the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast beneath him act at will, but even Yang Kai could unleash his killing moves, fiercely attacking Chi Xue.

In just a short moment, Chi Xue found himself overwhelmed, caught by a wind blade that cut a large gash in his clothing. Fortunately, his True Essence was robust, which allowed him to withstand the wind blade's lethal force, only causing a trickle of blood without injuring his bones.

Looking back at Yang Kai with resentment, Chi Xue's lips curled into a cold and provocative smile. Suddenly, he changed direction and plunged into a dense forest shrouded in white mist.

Yang Kai pursued relentlessly.

However, the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast beneath him suddenly halted outside the mist, and Yang Kai, caught off guard, stumbled into it due to inertia.

In mid-air, he hurriedly twisted his body and landed on the ground. Before he could assess the surrounding terrain, a piercing scream echoed in his ears.

It was Chi Xue!

He seemed to be suffering unbearable pain, and his scream sent chills down one’s spine.

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly. The next moment, a sharp pain surged in his mind, reminiscent of when the Earth Demon had tried to seize his body and destroy his consciousness.

Uncontrollably, Yang Kai let out a pained groan, veins bulging on his forehead, sweat pouring down like a stream, and his entire body trembled uncontrollably.

“Ah…” An even more piercing and tragic scream erupted, far more harrowing than Chi Xue's cry.

That was the Earth Demon wailing in agony!
