## Chapter 1531 — Then Go Die!

A centipede may not die even when crushed, how much more so for an expert like Qi Tianche who had already reached the threshold of the Void King Realm.

Even when slightly on the back foot, he did not lose heart; his only thought was to throw everything into crushing Yang Kai.

“Old wretch, choosing to match my fleshly strength in a place like this was the greatest mistake of your life — now it’s time you pay for that choice!” Yang Kai, drenched in blood, fought with savage relish; as he roared, a layer of five-colored radiance suddenly burst from his body.

Gold, cyan, white, red, and yellow interwove and fused, dazzling and domineering; the five-colored light swirled about Yang Kai, hissing.

The Undying Five Elements Sword Qi!

Yang Kai’s already overwhelming aura surged once more, and with it came an even more terrifying eruption of power—a force that seemed capable of splitting heaven and earth burst forth from within his body.

Qi Tianche was petrified with horror.

Having grappled with Yang Kai at close quarters, exchanging blows, he understood Yang Kai’s body better than anyone; when that five-colored radiance appeared, his strength rose by more than thirty percent.

Thirty percent might not sound like much, but it magnified his slender advantage to the extreme.

Boom……

Yang Kai threw a punch; Qi Tianche raised his hand to block but could not withstand the cataclysmic blow — his entire palm was driven back and imprinted on his chest.

The sound of bones cracking rang out; a depression caved into Qi Tianche’s chest, and the raised hand sagged limp.

His body and bones, tempered for hundreds to thousands of years, could not withstand such strikes and simply burst apart.

The clear snapping of bones came in rapid succession from Qi Tianche’s frame as Yang Kai’s punches rained down like a storm.

Fang Peng’s face twitched at the side; the corner of his eye spasmed wildly.

Qi Tianche screamed in terror, his liver and gall crushed; he no longer dared trade blows with Yang Kai and instinctively began to dodge, trying to pull back.

How could Yang Kai allow that?

Like a raging beast, he leapt onto Qi Tianche’s body and continued the relentless barrage.

Qi Tianche’s once-powerful frame was smashed into a mass of torn flesh; scarcely a whole patch remained, skin cracked and flesh exposed. Bones snapped and white bone stumps protruded, visible to the naked eye.

He screamed and could not dodge; Yang Kai’s fists made him spew blood like a fountain.

The battlefield he had deliberately chosen became his fatal restraint, leaving him no room to maneuver or deploy his footwork.

Bang……

Yang Kai swung another fist, striking Qi Tianche square on the bridge of the nose.

Under the force, Qi Tianche’s nose was twisted aside, making his already terrifying face look like a ferocious specter; both eyes were stained with blood and blurred. His body flew backward under the impact.

“Xiaoxiao!” Yang Kai barked.

The Stone Puppet brandished the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, leapt two steps forward from the rear, and fiercely swung the black staff in its hands.

Boom……

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar smashed into Qi Tianche’s back; his spine seemed pulverized and he was hurled backward once more.

Yang Kai looked at him coldly and did not finish him off. He felt that Xiaoxiao’s blow had almost completely shattered Qi Tianche’s ability to resist.

Like a dead fish, Qi Tianche collapsed to the ground, rolled a few times, and lay there as if utterly depleted of strength.

Yang Kai strode over, stood above him, and looked down with eyes like icy blades, flashing cold light.

Qi Tianche opened his mouth as if to speak, but no sound came out.

“Don’t rush—catch your breath first. I still have questions for you,” Yang Kai grinned, his mouth full of sharp white teeth now stained with his own golden blood, gleaming with a chilling luster.

Qi Tianche closed his eyes, seemingly resigned to his fate.

Yang Kai glanced up at Fang Peng a short distance away, letting out a cold, mirthless chuckle; his eyes brimmed with ill intent.

Under that gaze, Fang Peng felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar; his limbs trembled and, panic-stricken, he stammered, “Sect Master Yang, spare me! The matter at Fallen Emperor Mountains was just me carrying out orders — if there was offense, I apologize here.”

“Apologize?” Yang Kai sneered. “What do I need your apology for?”

Saying that, he pointed at him and said in a low voice, “Kill him!”

The Stone Puppet lunged and pounced on Fang Peng.

Moments later, shouts of alarm and the sounds of fighting rose from over there.

Yang Kai paid no attention. Outside, the Stone Puppet might not have been able to finish Fang Peng; after all, he was an expert of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — if he couldn’t win he could run. But here it was different: the entire place was only about thirty zhang across, and Fang Peng had no chance to escape.

Yang Kai turned his gaze back to Qi Tianche, waited a moment, and then asked, “How do you want to die?”

Qi Tianche seemed to catch his breath and chuckled hoarsely, “If Sect Master Yang truly wanted me dead, you would not be asking such a question.”

“You think I won’t kill you?” Yang Kai’s expression chilled.

“At the very least before leaving this place, Sect Master Yang would not slay me — you fear that if you kill me you’ll be unable to leave this place.”

“You are surprisingly clever to know what I want.” Yang Kai smiled.

“If I didn’t know that, then my living these years would be wasted. You have a request, and I wish to live — why not make a bargain?” Qi Tianche said between gasps.

“What bargain? Speak.” Yang Kai indicated for him to continue.

“Let me recuperate here for a while and, once my injuries are healed, I will let you go. Of course, Sect Master Yang must never trouble me again; I will thereafter remain in seclusion and not be your enemy.” Qi Tianche panted as he proposed.

“Then aren’t you the one getting the better end of the deal?” Yang Kai sneered coldly and mocked, “Old thing, don’t tell me you’ve forgotten one little detail?”

“What?” Qi Tianche replied leisurely.

“I am the butcher’s blade and you are the fish on the cutting board — whatever I want you to do, you must do.”

With a low shout, Yang Kai stamped out and savagely planted his foot onto one of Qi Tianche’s hands.

The sound of bones breaking rang out and that hand immediately deformed.

Qi Tianche’s face twisted in pain, but he did not even make a sound; he only stared at Yang Kai with venomous resentment.

“Let me out and I’ll leave you a whole corpse — that is this Sect Master’s greatest concession!”

“Ha — if that’s the case, I’d rather die here.” Qi Tianche slowly shook his head, calm and measured: “I also know the idea in your head. You think your understanding of Spatial Force far surpasses mine; if I can refine the Xuan Realm Pearl, you certainly can too. So even if you kill me, you only need some time to leave here, right?”

“Correct.” Yang Kai nodded.

“If that’s so, Sect Master Yang, be my guest and try. It’s not that I look down on you; even if your mastery over spatial power is deep, trying to refine the Xuan Realm Pearl here — hehe — I spent decades in seclusion to barely refine the Xuan Realm Pearl and open such a small Xuan Realm. For you inside it now, refining within would be a hundred to a thousand times more difficult than when I refined it. If you are willing to be trapped here for decades to hundreds of years, you may kill me — I will say nothing.” Qi Tianche said with a sinister laugh.

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

He could not quite tell whether Qi Tianche was trying to frighten him or speaking the truth.

If he truly were trapped here for decades to hundreds of years, by the time he emerged the world outside might have already changed beyond recognition.

“Sect Master Yang, you’d best think this through carefully. This matter is of utmost importance — there’s no room for even the slightest carelessness.” Qi Tianche added another line, pressing down on Yang Kai. With his life hanging by a thread, his fate resting entirely in Yang Kai’s hands, he naturally dared not relax.

Yang Kai stared at him without a word. After a long moment, he suddenly grinned. “Senior truly intends to go through with this? Not even the slightest room for discussion?”

Qi Tianche shook his head firmly. “If not this way, then this old man would rather die here.”

“Fine — then go die!” Yang Kai nodded lightly, lifted his foot, and stomped down hard on Qi Tianche’s head.

With a wet, splattering sound like a melon bursting, Qi Tianche’s head exploded; brains and gore spilled everywhere, and his two eyes rolled aside, still bearing an expression of disbelief.

“Pathetic!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

He had almost been fooled by Qi Tianche a moment ago.

The old bastard isn’t someone to be messed with — if he hadn’t woven his own snare this time, killing him wouldn’t be easy. How could Yang Kai let such a tiger go free? Whether his words are true or false, Qi Tianche must die.

With that decided, there was no need to hesitate.

Kill first, ask questions later.

As for being trapped within the Xuan Realm Pearl, it was not a major concern; even if Qi Tianche spoke the truth, Yang Kai’s deep study and mastery of spatial force meant he might well find a way out.

With Qi Tianche dead, Fang Peng — already struggling against the Stone Puppet — fared even worse. He had never wanted to fight here in the first place, and now seeing Yang Kai’s ruthless cruelty, his viciousness, he was frightened out of his wits.

He struggled with the Stone Puppet while loudly pleading for mercy.

Yang Kai paid him no heed; not only did he feel no mercy, but Fang Peng’s clamoring only stirred his impatience. He flickered forward and, joining forces with the Stone Puppet, pressed to annihilate him.

Even Qi Tianche had been no match for Yang Kai; in this strange environment, how could Fang Peng escape?

Within the span of half a cup of tea, the Leitai Sect’s Sect Master was gruesomely slain beneath the Heaven-Shaking Pillar of the Stone Puppet. Lacking Qi Tianche’s rugged body, a single strike from the Heaven-Shaking Pillar flattened him like a meat pie; he died a hideously miserable death.

With the two major foes eliminated, Yang Kai tidied up his spoils, sat cross-legged for a short while, and immediately began studying ways to leave.

Ripping open space was undoubtedly Yang Kai’s best hope; earlier his experiment had been interrupted by Qi Tianche, so he did not know whether tearing the space would actually work.

Now that no one disturbed him, he could properly experiment.
