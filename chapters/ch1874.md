## Chapter 1874 — Kuang Shizong

The entire Purple Star City trembled uneasily; countless martial artists looked up and stared toward the place where the great battle had erupted, each person gripped by terror and on edge.

Ninety-nine percent of them had no idea what exactly had happened over there, only that unquestionably a powerful expert was engaged in a life-and-death struggle, and as the saying went — when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer — none of them wanted to be drawn into it.

In an instant, countless people surged toward the city gate, desperate to flee Purple Star City and avoid the fallout.

Some bolder fighters, however, instead stampeded toward the direction of the battle, hoping to fish in troubled waters.

The more dangerous the place, the greater the opportunity — an eternal truth.

Somewhere below the Purple Star Palace, Zi Wuji grinned stupidly, a fanatical expression lighting his face.

He had never imagined Yang Kai would be so formidable.

When Li Maoming, constrained by favors, had agreed to act together with Gongsun Liang to deal with Yang Kai, Zi Wuji had thought his own prospects were lost; he had already steeled himself to accept failure and had been utterly despondent.

Now he had been reinvigorated, for in the clash between the three Second Stage of the Void King Realm experts, Yang Kai had actually gained a slight upper hand, while Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming were at a disadvantage even when acting together.

Could this Venerable Yang truly be that extraordinary? Such methods — perhaps even his father Zi Long could not match them, thought Zi Wuji; besides disbelief, he felt exhilaration. Vividly the beautiful future unfolded before him, and he could barely contain his excitement, silently urging Yang Kai again and again to cleave down Gongsun Liang beneath his sword.

In midair Yang Kai wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and flexed his body, his eyes shining as he stared toward the not-too-distant front.

A few li away, Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming both looked sallow-faced and stared over in shock.

In that brutal head-on exchange, none of the three had come out unscathed; Yang Kai was indeed somewhat injured, but Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming had suffered as well — it could be said to be a three-way, mutually damaging outcome.

This result was unacceptable to Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming!

The two together could almost unleash power equivalent to a Third Stage of the Void King Realm, yet Yang Kai had been able to hold them off! Did that not mean this man had the qualification to contend with a Third Stage of the Void King Realm?

This revelation upended the long-held assumptions of Li Maoming and Gongsun Liang!

Second Stage, Third Stage — only a single step, yet a world apart; each breakthrough within the Void King Realm brought a leap in power. Moreover, the eyes across from them showed not the slightest hint of retreat but instead an exuberant battle intent that made the hairs on Li Maoming and Gongsun Liang's scalps stand on end...

What kind of freak was this? The two found themselves increasingly unable to fathom Yang Kai.

Clang...

A clear, crisp sound rang through the sky — the two Void King-Grade Secret Treasures that had been clashing struck each other and made the noise as the jade-green giant dragon reverted to a Dragon Bone sword and the fish-shaped thing resumed its true form. Both sword-type Secret Treasures flew back toward their owners' hands.

The Dragon Bone sword was intact, its whole body verdant and haloed with flowing light.

Gongsun Liang's short sword, by contrast, dimmed; its radiance had waned considerably, and its Spiritual Qi was clearly depleted.

Staring at that short sword, Gongsun Liang felt a surge of anger and his wounds worsened; he spat a mouthful of blood, his momentum flagging considerably.

"Brother Yang, stop!" Li Maoming's expression changed, his face grave as he looked toward Yang Kai; he spoke in a low voice, genuinely not wanting to continue the fight. He had come out this time at another's request to protect Zi Wuji's safety, was forced into skirmishes with peers against his will, and least of all did he want to contend with a monster like Yang Kai.

Yang Kai let out a feral grin. “You decide to fight when you please and stop when you please — and you expect me not to lose face?”

“How do you want to handle this, then? Just lay out your terms — we’re not strangers here, everything can be talked through.” Li Maoming still regarded Yang Kai as one of his own; clearly, the Venerable One's Token carried considerable weight.

“Simple.” Yang Kai bared his teeth in a grin and stepped forward. “A fight — life and death left to fate. Once we’re done, I’ll leave. Whether you come at me one by one or all at once… makes no difference to me.”

"You..." Li Maoming, angry and baffled, stared at Yang Kai and said, "Why go to such lengths?"

He never imagined Yang Kai would make such an absurd demand. Once one reached the Void King Realm, everyone generally avoided head-on clashes — no Void King was someone to be trifled with, and each carried hidden trump cards. Cornering such people benefited no one. Yet Li Maoming had truly never seen someone like Yang Kai, someone who would force another Void King into another battle.

"I only advanced to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm not long ago, and it's rare to encounter opponents of the same Stage; I want to test where my limits lie," Yang Kai smiled slightly. "You are worthy opponents."

“Bullshit!” Before Li Maoming could even speak, Gongsun Liang snapped, glaring furiously at Yang Kai, hatred etched into his eyes. “Old monster still pretending to be young — have you no shame?”

He had at first thought Yang Kai looked young, but after a bout of fighting he had concluded Yang Kai was certainly a cultivator who had lived for a thousand years or more, otherwise such power would be impossible.

If someone who had only just advanced to the Second Stage could take on two opponents alone—overpowering both him and Li Maoming even in their combined assault—then Gongsun Liang might as well go find a wall and dash his brains out.

"Believe it or not, this matter won't be left unresolved," Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Seeing him so aggressive, a flash of anger passed across Gongsun Liang's eyes; his mouth moved but in the end he could not say anything.

He was filled with regret.

Just now, if he had dropped the matter, none of this would have happened. But because he pressed his advantage without restraint and tried to seize the Void Mind Crystal in Yang Kai’s hand, all the trouble that followed was stirred up.

As a result his domain field had been damaged, his Secret Treasure had lost much of its sentience, and his body had been injured...

To fully recover he would need a closed-door retreat of at least a hundred years.

Now it was far too late for regrets — Gongsun Liang’s heart twisted with a bitterness he could hardly bear.

"If the two of you won't come at me, then I'll make the first move," Yang Kai said as he looked over; his Saint Yuan flowed silently.

At that moment he suddenly frowned and looked up toward a certain direction.

At the same time Gongsun Liang, Li Maoming, and even the other Void King Realm elders of Purple Star all turned pale and looked toward the same direction.

From over the horizon a figure approached at an unhurried pace; at first they seemed very distant, but in the blink of an eye they had arrived at the center of the battlefield.

The newcomer was an old man with white hair and beard, wearing a spotless linen robe and without any imposing aura, looking no different from an ordinary old man.

Yet Yang Kai's expression became extremely grave, for he had sensed an unimaginable pressure from that old man.

Upon reaching the battlefield center, the old man turned and looked around with a sullen face.

Everyone the old man looked upon could not help averting their eyes and bowing their heads.

Over the vast area there was a sudden hush, as quiet as if a needle dropped; even breathing was suppressed, lest it displease the old man.

"Hmph!"

After a long while the old man gave a single snort.

The sound seemed ordinary, yet it seemed to pull at some mysterious force, like a morning bell or evening drum striking hard on everyone's hearts, causing each person to tremble and their blood to race.

Yang Kai's brow lifted and a flash of brilliance exploded in his eyes.

Third Stage of the Void King Realm!

He had suspected it when the old man appeared, and now he was certain — this was a genuine Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert!

One of the supreme existences in the entire Star Domain, so rare they could be counted on one's fingers.

A name suddenly popped into Yang Kai's mind.

Kuang Shizong!

Zi Donglai had once told him about the distribution and numbers of Purple Star's experts, so Yang Kai knew Purple Star had long hosted a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert, and this person was Kuang Shizong.

This old man's seniority was frighteningly high; even Zi Long would have to address him as Senior Uncle!

Yet no one knew where this person had been, for no one had seen him in Purple Star for two hundred years. Some said he had passed away, some said he had traveled to the most dangerous places in the Star Domain to seek higher Martial Dao, others said he had shattered the void and left the Star Domain...

No one had expected he had been in Purple Star City all along, and that he would appear at this time.

Gongsun Liang, Li Maoming, and those Void King Realm elders finally regained their composure and, looking respectful, bowed in the direction of Kuang Shizong, greeting, "Hails to Patriarch!"

Many Origin Returning Realm martial artists then realized who the newcomer was and dared not be remiss; one after another they kowtowed.

"Do you still have this Patriarch in your eyes?" Kuang Shizong looked coldly at them; cold sweat broke out on every forehead, even mighty Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming bowed their heads like children who had erred, unable to utter a sound.

"Two hundred years without coming out, and you have all improved," Kuang Shizong sneered, "and yet you have turned Purple Star City into such a state. How do you answer the ancestors who built the foundation of Purple Star?"

At the rebuke the crowd trembled and sweated profusely.

"If I did not come out, were you planning to tear apart the Purple Star Palace?" Kuang Shizong thundered.

"We would not dare!" Gongsun Liang replied, trembling with fear.

"Why would you not dare? I see you all have courage when doing bold deeds — why lack the courage to admit it?"

"We are unfilial, please forgive us, Patriarch!" Gongsun Liang cried aloud.

"We are unfilial, please forgive us, Patriarch!" countless voices from below echoed in unison.

"What is the matter with today's situation?" Kuang Shizong roared, his white hair seeming to rise though there was no wind, his anger extreme. "Speak quickly and tell me!"

Gongsun Liang trembled and, daring not to conceal anything, hurriedly recounted the sequence of events.
