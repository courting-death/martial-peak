## Chapter 2424 — I Am Very Unhappy

Yang Kai snorted. “Why is Lord Feng Xuan so quick to react? I never said it was you who ambushed me—could it be that Your Excellency is feeling guilty?”

 Feng Xuan was momentarily speechless. As a Third Stage Emperor Realm master, he had to maintain some dignity. He couldn't bicker with Yang Kai like this—that would be too disgraceful.

At this critical moment, Feng Xi jumped out and shouted, "Brat, you spout nothing but nonsense! How dare you insult my Wenqing Sect? Kneel and apologize at once, and perhaps I'll spare your life."

His expression was twisted, as if he wanted nothing more than to kill Yang Kai on the spot. Clearly, he was still brooding over what happened the previous night. It was no wonder—having been pampered since childhood, when had he ever suffered such humiliation? Every time he recalled it over the past two days, he felt utterly ashamed, wishing he could tear Yang Kai limb from limb and drink his blood to vent his hatred.

Yang Kai looked at him and chuckled, "Isn't this the Sect Master’s son? How come you were scared out of your wits last night, but now you’re strutting around so arrogantly? Did you find yourself a backer? Oh, don’t glare at me like that—careful, or your eyeballs might pop out."

"You... you’re spouting nonsense! That never happened!" Feng Xi gritted his teeth and glared at him, his face alternating between green and red as he repeatedly denied it.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, "Last night, the Sect Master’s son was crying and begging me to spare his life. Out of compassion, I let you go. But instead of being grateful, you repay kindness with enmity. How do you explain that?"

Hearing this, Hu Yuan and the others all looked at Feng Xi with strange expressions. They thought to themselves that there was clearly some grudge between these two young men, though they had no idea what exactly happened last night. To think the Wenqing Sect’s Sect Master’s son had cried and begged that young man for his life.

No wonder things were so tense between them.

Feng Xi wanted to argue further, but Feng Xuan waved his hand to stop him.

Feng Xi’s face turned red and his neck bulged with anger, but he didn’t dare disobey his father’s order. He could only swallow his grievances, his eyes filled with blood and tears of accusation.

Feng Xuan looked at Yang Kai and said blandly, "Young man, ambition is not a bad thing, but you must know when to advance and when to retreat. Reckless bravado is the mark of a fool."

"Pah!" Yang Kai spat on the ground, standing there lazily with a casual salute to Feng Xuan. "Your teachings, my lord, I will remember. But... what exactly are you trying to say?"

Feng Xuan frowned, "I heard you stole two Spatial Rings from my Wenqing Sect last night?"

Stole two Spatial Rings from the Wenqing Sect? Hu Yuan and the others all widened their eyes, each one looking at Yang Kai as if he were a legend.

Before, they thought Yang Kai was just a reckless youth, but now it seemed he was more than that—he was a madman!

In the entire Northern Territory, who would dare rob the Wenqing Sect of their Spatial Rings? Yet this brat not only did it, he took two at once! Who were the unlucky ones who lost their rings, and what treasures did they contain, to make the Sect Master himself intervene?

This brat is finished. Just for this alone, he probably won’t live to see tomorrow.

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious as he declared loudly, "My lord, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want! What do you mean, ‘stole’? That’s the act of a bandit. I have always acted openly and uprightly, never doing such things. Using the word ‘stole’ to describe me tarnishes my noble character. I am very unhappy!"

He wore a solemn expression, his face suddenly darkening, as if he were truly angry.

Hu Yuan and the others all wiped the cold sweat from their foreheads.

These Emperor Realm experts had roamed the Star Realm for thousands of years, but only today did they truly broaden their horizons. Nothing they’d seen in their lives compared to the shock of today. This strange young man, who seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, was truly a marvel—facing a Third Stage Emperor Realm master without the slightest sign of weakness, and even talking rings around him.

Yao Zhuo shouted angrily, "Was it not you who took my and Xi’er’s Spatial Rings? Don’t you dare lie through your teeth, brat!"

At those words, the sweat Hu Yuan and the others had just wiped away reappeared. So the two unlucky ones who lost their Spatial Rings were actually the Wenqing Sect’s Vice Sect Master and the Sect Master’s son!

This has blown up completely—there’s no way to resolve it now!

They had thought Yang Kai had robbed a couple of Wenqing Sect disciples, but that wasn’t the case at all. Feng Xi was one thing—just a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm—but Yao Zhuo was a renowned Second Stage Emperor Realm expert. How could someone like that have his Spatial Ring stolen?

No matter how this ends, the Wenqing Sect has lost all face. The Vice Sect Master and the Sect Master’s son both had their Spatial Rings taken by a young man at the Third Stage Dao Origin Realm. If word got out, how could the Wenqing Sect show their faces in the Northern Territory again?

Hu Yuan could already imagine this bizarre event being turned into a ballad and sung in every street and alley. For the next ten years, no one from the Wenqing Sect would be able to hold their heads up in public.

"So it was those two Spatial Rings..." Yang Kai suddenly looked enlightened, then his face darkened as he snorted, "Vice Sect Master, you should speak with a clear conscience. How were those two rings stolen by me? One was given to me as a bargaining chip in a deal with you, and the other was forced on me by the Sect Master’s son. I only accepted it because he insisted. Now you want to turn around and accuse me?"

"Nonsense!" Yao Zhuo was nearly driven mad with anger, his Emperor Yuan surging as if he wanted to tear Yang Kai to pieces.

Yang Kai nimbly leapt back, landing in front of An Ruoyun and the others, glaring at him. "What, you want to kill me? Go ahead, try it."

"Sect Master!" Yao Zhuo turned and cupped his fists to Feng Xuan. "I want to kill him!"

Feng Xuan replied blandly, "You can’t."

 With Yang Kai hiding among An Ruoyun and the others, Yao Zhuo had no chance to kill him. As the Wenqing Sect’s Sect Master, Feng Xuan couldn’t personally strike down Yang Kai here either. He suddenly realized this mysterious young man was giving him a bigger headache than Bing Yun.

After a moment’s thought, he looked at Yang Kai and said, "Young Brother, you are a dragon among men. You will surely achieve great things in the future. Consider those two rings a meeting gift from my sect."

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and snorted, “My lord, you certainly have a way with cheap words.”

Feng Xuan knew he’d never get the rings back, so he simply called them a meeting gift to save face. Still, this did show the Wenqing Sect’s magnanimity and helped them recover some dignity.

"However, there is one thing I must reclaim. I hope you will cooperate."

Yang Kai frowned, "What is it?"

He hadn’t noticed anything special in the rings when he checked them before, though there were indeed many treasures inside.

"A Bloodjade Qilin," Feng Xuan said solemnly.

"Bloodjade Qilin?" Yang Kai muttered, then swept his Divine Sense through the Spatial Ring. Soon, with a flip of his hand, a crimson qilin statue appeared in his palm. The statue was about three inches tall, exquisitely carved and lifelike. Yang Kai had no idea what material it was made from—he’d glanced at it before and tossed it into the ring. Only now, with Feng Xuan mentioning it, did he remember.

"That’s the one!" Feng Xuan nodded.

"What’s so special about this thing?" Yang Kai asked curiously, not understanding why Feng Xuan wanted it back so badly.

Feng Xuan did not hide anything and explained, “This item is of no use to you, Young Brother. It is the symbol of the Sect Master’s wife in my Wenqing Sect, passed down from our founding ancestor. To the Wenqing Sect, it holds great significance!”

"The Sect Master’s wife’s status symbol!" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and glanced at Zi Yu, who was still kneeling nearby. He thought to himself that Feng Xi must care about her—despite having sixty-nine concubines at home, he’d given this Bloodjade Qilin as a betrothal gift to Zi Yu, showing how much he valued her.

No wonder—Zi Yu was the top rising star of Ice Heart Valley, her background and talent a perfect match for Feng Xi, far surpassing his sixty-nine concubines.

He didn’t know if Feng Xuan was telling the truth, or if there was some secret hidden in the Bloodjade Qilin. As he pondered, a voice transmission suddenly sounded in his ear: "Feng Xuan isn’t lying. The Bloodjade Qilin really is the symbol of the Sect Master’s wife. Only with it can one be considered the Sect Master’s wife; all other women are just concubines."

The one sending the message was An Ruoyun, who would never lie. Yang Kai nodded to himself.

"That’s right, I must reclaim the Bloodjade Qilin. Please hand it over!" Feng Xuan said, reaching out to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned, "You only want this? The treasures in those two rings are enough to rival a nation’s wealth. Don’t you want anything else?"

Feng Xuan replied proudly, "Those things may be valuable, but to my Wenqing Sect, they’re just a drop in the ocean. Only the Bloodjade Qilin cannot be lost."

Yang Kai laughed loudly, "The Wenqing Sect truly lives up to its reputation as a top sect in the Northern Territory—so wealthy that you don’t even care about so many treasures. Truly eye-opening!"

Feng Xi snorted coldly and mocked, "Country bumpkin who’s never seen the world!"

Yang Kai looked at him with a meaningful smile. Feng Xi shivered for no reason, a sense of foreboding suddenly enveloping him.

Suddenly, Yang Kai turned to Feng Xuan and said, "If you want the Bloodjade Qilin back, it’s not impossible. Since it’s so important to your sect, I can’t just take what belongs to someone else."

"It’s good that you understand," Feng Xuan said blandly.

Yang Kai grinned, "Last night, I told the Sect Master’s son and the Vice Sect Master that everything in this world can be negotiated. If you want the Bloodjade Qilin back, that’s only natural. Just... offer a little compensation!"

As he spoke, he rubbed his middle finger and thumb together quickly, looking like a money-grubber.

Watching from the sidelines, Hu Yuan and the others were completely floored.
