## Chapter 1780 — Spiritual Medicine

Yang Kai searched the void rift for Ethereal Crystals while quietly calculating the passage of time.

When he felt the time was about right, he stopped.

In less than half an hour he had made some gains, though not many—he had only found five Ethereal Crystals that had been nurtured and born within the void rift.

He paused at a spot in the void rift, looked ahead, and wore a thoughtful expression.

While moving through the void rift he had noticed that many places inside it displayed wildly unstable fluctuations in spatial power, waves of strange force ebbing and surging.

If he guessed correctly, those unstable areas were precisely where the countless spatial rifts of the Lost Realm connected to the void.

In other words, stepping out from those unstable areas was equivalent to walking out of the spatial rifts.

To verify his theory, Yang Kai strode forward.

The next moment he exited the void rift and returned to the Lost Realm.

Looking around, there was no sign of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light nearby, and behind him a spatial rift visible to the naked eye spanned across the sky.

He had clearly come out through that rift.

Staring at the spatial rift behind him, Yang Kai nodded to himself; it seemed his conjecture had been correct—every unstable spot within that void rift’s space was connected to a rift existing in the Lost Realm.

Only… he did not know whether this place was still within Medicine Valley.

Yang Kai examined the surroundings carefully, and after a moment, once the landscape came into focus, his face brightened and he muttered, "Lucky."

This place was clearly still within the range of Medicine Valley—the air carried various medicinal scents, and not far from him stood a short fruit tree bearing three pale yellow fruits.

This spot had apparently never been searched!

It was not surprising—the Medicine Valley was vast, few people entered here, and with the interference of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, everyone’s search time was greatly reduced. So at this moment Medicine Valley surely still contained a great deal of heaven-and-earth treasure.

With a shift of his steps, Yang Kai arrived before the short fruit tree. He crouched down to examine it carefully for a moment, then raised his brows and broke into a grin.

He had already recognized what kind of spirit fruit it was.

It was the fabled Longevity Fruit!

This thing was useless for cultivation, but it could prolong life, and its effect was excellent.

Although martial artists lived longer as their power increased—Void King Realm experts could expect to live three or four thousand years or even longer without unexpected incidents—everyone’s lifespan had a limit; when it reached its end the body withered and the Qi and blood dispersed. Then one would inevitably enter reincarnation.

At that point many of these experts began seeking Spiritual Pills that increased lifespan, hoping to live a little longer and make another breakthrough, thereby further extending their years.

Ordinary Spiritual Pills were useless to those experts; only Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills could affect them. How many Void King-Grade pills that increased lifespan existed within a Star Domain? How many people could refine them?

Pills capable of increasing the lifespan of Void King Realm experts were exceedingly rare.

The Longevity Fruit before him could be refined into a Longevity Pill; a single pill could add at least one hundred years of life! Although a person could take at most three pills and the effect diminished with each dose, if one took all three, increasing life by two hundred years was no problem.

Two hundred years would allow a Void King Realm expert to accomplish a great deal.

If they made a breakthrough within those two hundred years, their lifespan would be greatly extended once more.

If such Longevity Pills could be refined and sold to the right buyers, they would fetch an astronomical price!

One only has a single life—who would dare not to cherish it?

Even those Void King Realm experts whose lifespans were far from ending would want to keep a single pill in reserve; it could become a family heirloom, passed down generation to generation.

As Yang Kai thought of the value of the Longevity Fruit and the Longevity Pill, he happily picked the three fruits with great care, ensuring his harvesting methods did not diminish their medicinal efficacy, then placed them into a wooden box, sealed them carefully, and tossed them into his Spatial Ring.

With his gain secured, Yang Kai was in high spirits and continued exploring the vicinity.

No one had come by here for a long time; in the time that followed Yang Kai had one gain after another and loaded himself with a bountiful haul.

When half an hour passed and the Seven Luminaries Divine Light approached again, he found a nearby spatial rift and slipped into it, searching the void for Ethereal Crystals.

Estimating the time was nearly right, he returned from the void into Medicine Valley.

Repeating this many times over…

He did not waste a moment—he could gather Spiritual Medicine in Medicine Valley and harvest Ethereal Crystals in the void rifts. Alternating between the two, his haul surpassed everyone else’s.

Truly, helping others is helping oneself! Yang Kai sighed inwardly. If he hadn’t been mindful of Luo Lan’s reputation at the time, he never would have chosen to hide within the spatial rift.

Had he not chosen so, he would not have discovered such an efficient way to use his time.

A single inadvertent action had brought him enormous returns.

Time passed and Yang Kai lost track of how long he had stayed in Medicine Valley; shuttling between the void rifts and the valley, he collected more than two hundred Ethereal Crystals and nearly a hundred portions of Spiritual Herbs and Medicines.

Such a harvest was terrifying.

Both Ethereal Crystals and those medicinal materials were immensely valuable, and Yang Kai was certain that no one else’s gains matched his.

Yet since parting from Luo Lan, he had not encountered anyone else, which puzzled him.

At one moment Yang Kai followed a strange medicinal scent to his left; suddenly his expression changed and his brows drew together.

His Divine Sense detected other people nearby—more than one; in fact three individuals.

Two of them were together: one a Second Stage of the Void King Realm, the other a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm! The third was alone.

At that moment Yang Kai and the three of them formed a triangular formation, all moving toward the same direction—clearly drawn by the medicinal scent.

Because so few people entered Medicine Valley, Yang Kai immediately deduced who the three were.

The two together were easy to identify: among Origin Returning Realm practitioners at the Third Stage, aside from himself only Zi Donglai and Xue Yue possessed such cultivation. The other’s aura was not Xue Yue’s, so it had to be Zi Donglai.

The one with Zi Donglai was surely Zi Long, the master of Purple Star! The father and son could be expected to stick together in Medicine Valley.

The lone Void King Realm expert’s aura told Yang Kai his identity—Xu Wei!

He was the elder of the Abandoned Nest who had used the Illusory Void Butterfly against him before.

Yang Kai could locate them with his Divine Sense, and they would of course be able to detect his presence as well.

At the instant they discovered one another, Zi Long and Zi Donglai accelerated greatly, surely intending to reach the source of the medicinal scent before Yang Kai and Xu Wei and seize that unknown heaven-and-earth treasure!

Zi Long acted out of confidence in his great power.

A Second Stage of the Void King Realm could only be matched in Medicine Valley by Ghost Ancestor and Ni Guang; he held no regard for others, especially not a junior like Yang Kai—he felt he could crush Yang Kai with a single finger.

On the other side, after hesitating a moment, Xu Wei also sped forward.

Faced with the temptation of heaven-and-earth treasure, he did not intend to back down; even if the other party was Zi Long, he had no intention of kowtowing to him. As an elder of the Abandoned Nest, he had no need to appease Zi Long—they were enemies already and he was not afraid of making another enemy.

As both sides increased their speed, Yang Kai moved as well.

The three parties—four people in total—all rushed rapidly toward the center.

"Hmph, ignorant fools!" Zi Long had thought his strength would intimidate Yang Kai and Xu Wei into fleeing, but unexpectedly those two showed no sign of evasion and instead intended to contest the Spiritual Medicine with him.

This greatly angered him; he felt insulted and that his face had been slightly tarnished.

Xu Wei could be dismissed—though not as strong as him, he was still a Void King Realm expert and taking him down would require effort, and Zi Long did not want to waste time on Xu Wei in a place like this.

But that Third Stage Origin Returning brat—what did he think he was? To dare contest him? Did he not know how to write the character for death?

"Father, shall I go and—" Zi Donglai’s eyes flashed cold as he asked in a low voice.

He had long harbored dislike for Yang Kai.

As the Young Master of Purple Star, he could enter here only because Zi Long had brought him; Xue Yue was a peer among promising youths and naturally qualified to tread this ground.

But who was Yang Kai? Zi Donglai had never seen him before and had never heard his name.

That this fellow had come to the same treasure ground as him and Xue Yue made Zi Donglai furious.

He felt the prestige of this place had been lowered by Yang Kai’s presence!

Sharing a place with an unknown fool was an insult to Zi Donglai; only by killing him could that humiliation be cleansed.

Thus when he sensed Yang Kai he grew eager to try, wanting to use his strength to show the vast gap between geniuses like himself and someone like Yang Kai—to tell him that not everyone could enter the Lost Realm, and those who dared would pay the price!

"A jumping jester, no need to bother with him!" Zi Long snorted coldly. "If he dares show himself to you, then move."

"Yes!" Zi Donglai nodded and sneered, "I just fear he lacks the nerve."

Upon saying this Zi Donglai paused, for in his sensations Yang Kai had not been deterred by the hidden danger ahead but instead was increasing his speed.

“How amusing—there really is someone stupid enough to seek death!!” Zi Donglai sneered darkly, his gaze fixed in the direction where Yang Kai was, as if wishing he would appear sooner.
