## Chapter 650 — True Yuan Exhausted

Moreover, when the Demon Mark unfolded, delicate streaks of emerald ran across Guan'er's pretty face, lending her an exotic, alluring beauty that was completely at odds with her usual temperament.

As for Li Rong, leaders such as Han Fei and Hua Mo could even unfold the Demon Mark to deeper layers, and their own strength would be greatly enhanced.

However, there were no enemies in the Small Xuan Realm, and Guan'er had not seen many of the leaders take action; she had only heard of such things and had never witnessed them herself.

Within Mo Shen Fort there were even secret Martial Skill manuals developed specifically for the Demon Mark—gifts left behind by the Great Demon God.

Yang Kai listened with great interest and wanted to borrow them for a look, but Guan'er said those Martial Skill manuals could only be consulted by clan members with outstanding aptitude; even she had never seen them, which left Yang Kai feeling regretful.

Although Li Rong was kind to him, Yang Kai knew his own limits; asking her to lend him those Martial Skill manuals left by the Great Demon God now would likely be unrealistic.

Containing his thoughts, Yang Kai's days passed in plain monotony; each day, aside from refining pills, he either cultivated or chatted with Guan'er about curiosities from the outside world.

Time slipped by, and before he knew it nearly a year had passed since Yang Kai arrived in this Small Xuan Realm.

In that year Yang Kai's alchemy advanced remarkably; by now, without the aid of a spirit formation, he could already refine Spirit-Grade pills.

What Xiao Fusheng of Yao Wang Valley had wished for his whole life but never attained was achieved in Yang Kai's hands in just over a year.

Yang Kai could only sigh—different heavens and earth yield different potentials. Master Xiao's attainments in alchemy were far deeper than Yang Kai's, but due to the limitations of that realm, the Spirit-Grade pills he hoped for were merely a luxury.

One day, after finishing a Spirit-Grade pill, Yang Kai drew a deep breath, sat to regulate his breath for a moment, then suddenly opened his eyes and shouted into the empty stone chamber, "Senior, could you help me fetch Lady Li? I have something to discuss with her."

Duan Ya, concealed in the void, was startled and glanced at him, suddenly realizing that this human youth was staring directly at the place where he was hidden—intelligence shining in his eyes, unblinking.

Duan Ya was utterly astonished.

Ever since the farce when Pan Lang came to cause trouble for Yang Kai, Duan Ya had followed Li Rong's orders and secretly guarded this place at all times; he had not expected that the boy had long since noticed and could even precisely locate his position.

Yang Kai was only at the Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage, while Duan Ya was at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm—the gap in strength was enormous. How had he discovered him? When had he discovered him?

A deep shock flashed through Duan Ya's mind, but he revealed nothing on his face; he stepped out from concealment, gave Yang Kai a slight nod, then his body dimmed and he vanished.

After a moment, the air beside Yang Kai warped, ripples visible to the naked eye appearing; from that distorted air came some void force, and then Li Rong appeared.

Yang Kai showed a somewhat interested expression; he had noticed that this noblewoman always appeared in this way—seemingly able to command the power of the void to suddenly materialize here from somewhere else.

"I heard you were looking for me?" Li Rong stepped forward and asked bluntly.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

"What is it?"

"I need to replenish my True Yuan."

"Replenish your True Yuan?" Li Rong's dark brows knitted; she released her Divine Sense and swept it through Yang Kai, then asked in puzzlement, "Isn't your True Yuan quite plentiful?"

With her formidable cultivation, she could naturally sense that within Yang Kai's body and meridians flowed True Yuan as dense as a substance, containing destructive potential.

Moreover, this extremely pure Yang-attribute True Yuan greatly restrained the demonic qi of ordinary clan members.

"No no no..." Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly. "The True Yuan in my meridians is indeed ample, but there is very little left in my Dantian. Without True Yuan I cannot refine pills."

"What do you mean?" Li Rong grew more puzzled. "To replenish True Yuan, can't you just run your cultivation technique? If you want me to do it, how am I to help?"

Yang Kai smiled, "The technique I cultivate is somewhat unusual—well, rather, my constitution is a bit special; True Yuan cannot be replenished through cultivation."

The True Yang Yuan Qi in his body had always been obtained by absorbing certain Yang-attribute heaven-and-earth treasures, drawing their energy into himself, condensing it into Yang Liquid, and storing it in his Dantian.

If he merely sat and ran his cultivation without the proper environment, the energy drawn from the air would only be stored as reserves for the Proud Bone Golden Body and could not form Yang Liquid—unless he cultivated in an environment abundant with Yang qi.

It had been who-knew-when since he last replenished Yang Liquid; over such a long time the Yang Liquid in Yang Kai's Dantian had dwindled to almost nothing—only a few drops remained, and if he did not replenish it soon it would be completely used up.

Without Yang Liquid to suppress the evil energy within his Proud Bone Golden Body, Yang Kai estimated he would soon enter a demonic state.

"So what do you want me to do?" Li Rong, though still not fully understanding, was too weary to ask further.

"Do you have any Yang-attribute heaven-and-earth treasures? I need such items."

"Yang-attribute things are utterly incompatible with our demon clan; do you think we would have such materials?" A flash of displeasure crossed Li Rong's face, then suspicion; she regarded Yang Kai with distrust, "You're not deceiving me, are you?"

"I have no reason to lie to you." Yang Kai shrugged. "You truly don't have any Yang-attribute items?"

"We really don't."

Yang Kai's face darkened and he frowned, "Then this is a big problem. Without Yang-attribute items I cannot replenish my True Yuan; without replenishing True Yuan I cannot refine pills... as you can see, refining pills requires support from my True Yang Yuan Qi."

"What can be done?" Li Rong immediately grew anxious.

This human had extreme talent in alchemy—after only a year he could refine Spirit-Grade pills. At such a rate of growth there would be no need to wait ten years; Saint-Grade pills could be produced by his hand. But now, because of this problem, he could not continue refining pills; it was utterly absurd.

Li Rong did not know what special technique this human cultivated or how peculiar his constitution was, but seeing he spoke with such gravity, she believed him without doubt.

Looking at Yang Kai, Li Rong could not help but wear a helpless, sorrowful expression.

Their clansmen had been trapped here for countless years; throughout those years each person's wish was to leave and see the outside world. Now that they had finally glimpsed a sliver of hope, it had been mercilessly cut off by such a turn of events.

Li Rong could almost imagine how disappointed the clansmen's expressions would be when they heard this news.

As she thought this, Li Rong's beautiful eyes suddenly brightened and she grew excited, murmuring, "Although we don't possess Yang-attribute items ourselves, there are such things within this Small Xuan Realm..."

"Where?" Yang Kai immediately grew hopeful; without Yang Liquid he was in serious trouble. If he could not become the hope of the Ancient Demon Clan, he would have no value to live on—Li Rong would no longer look after him, and what awaited him would be nothing but a road to death.

Li Rong did not answer him but frowned in thought; after a long moment she said, "You should rest for two days. In two days I will give you news."

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Li Rong hurried away.

With so little Yang Liquid, Yang Kai dared not casually refine pills; utterly bored, he had Guan'er take him to play outside Mo Shen Fort for two days.

Come to think of it, since arriving in this Small Xuan Realm he had not left that stone chamber—partly because he did not wish to show his face and attract the attention of other demons, and partly because he was so obsessed with improving his alchemy that he neglected sleep and food.

Now that he had free time, he naturally wanted to go out and move about.

Within Mo Shen Fort Yang Kai had witnessed the ferocity and bloodiness of these demon clan members and seen their indomitable endurance. When practicing Martial Skills, these demons often truly struck to kill; their sparring was entirely different from that of human-world warriors—it was a genuine life-or-death struggle.

Often one party would be beaten until flesh and blood were blurred, collapsing unable to rise, and that would be the end.

Yet the Ancient Demon Clan's physical constitution was extraordinarily hardy; no matter how grievous the wounds, after a short rest they would be capable of fighting again.

Yang Kai watched with astonished admiration and was deeply impressed.

In a vast plaza within Mo Shen Fort, Yang Kai also saw an imposing, colossal statue.

It was a statue of a person, with no trace of which era it came from or which artisan had carved it; it was lifelike and supremely solemn, and every demon clan member who passed by displayed extreme reverence.

Gazing at the statue, Yang Kai inexplicably felt a hidden, wondrous energy emanating from it, drawing at his Proud Bone Golden Body and nearly causing the evil power within to burst forth.

Yang Kai's face changed; he hastily suppressed it, his complexion turning ghastly pale in an instant, sweat streaming down.

For an instant a strange voice seemed to echo in his mind, but when he strained to listen the voice vanished; he did not know whether it had been an illusion.

"What's wrong with you?" Guan'er was taken aback; she did not know what had befallen Yang Kai—just moments ago he had been lively, and suddenly something was off.

"It's nothing—probably just hasn't been out moving about in a long time," Yang Kai said, his gaze flashing.

"You humans, your bodies are so weak..." Guan'er laughed teasingly.

"Whose statue is this?" Yang Kai asked casually.

"It is the statue of our ancestors' master—the Great Demon God!" Guan'er immediately straightened her expression and bowed toward it in respect.

"The Great Demon God?" Yang Kai was stunned.

"Yes, majestic, isn't it? It is said that in the era when the Great Demon God existed, our demon clan unified the land; your humans and the beast-folk were all our vassals."

"That powerful?"

"Of course the Great Demon God was powerful; his martial might topped across the ages, and to this day no one can match him."

"Where has such a figure gone now?"

"Nobody knows." Guan'er shook her head.

"Then why did he seal your ancestors here? What sin did you commit?"

"I don't know either..." Guan'er, at a loss, grew red-faced with anger and embarrassment, "Where do all these questions come from? You're so annoying!"
