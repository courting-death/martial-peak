## Chapter 1602 — Get Him

Beside Domain Stone Mountain, Fire Radiance Sect's Zhang Qing, his expression savage, unleashed his Shi, sweeping it over Yang Kai and the other two.

His Shi seemed laced with a peculiar profound intent; as it spread it conjured the sensation of standing at the mouth of a volcano — unbearable heat that felt as if it would roast a person alive.

Qian Tong and Lin Yurao's faces shifted; they both released their own Shi to brace against it.

Yang Kai lifted an eyebrow, a look of interest crossing his face.

Zhang Qing truly had reason to be arrogant — his Shi had clearly reached the a minor accomplishment!

Shi is a special power; once a martial artist breaks through to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, they can refine it, and as one’s cultivation Stage rises, so too does the potency of the Shi.

But to temper one’s Shi to a minor accomplishment requires fusing one’s unique force into it, strengthening the Shi’s might.

For example, Yang Kai can weave Spatial Force into his Shi!

And this Zhang Qing, evidently, can do the same — his Shi is suffused with the power of fire.

Among those at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, perhaps only about two in ten can do this — bring their Shi to minor accomplishment — and Zhang Qing was undoubtedly one of them.

Qian Tong and Lin Yurao likewise counted among that number, which is why they could withstand Zhang Qing’s pressure of Shi; it was also the fundamental reason Tianze felt inferior to people like Qian Tong.

Before Yang Kai and the other two, it was as if an invisible barrier had been added, holding Zhang Qing’s Shi at bay, unable to advance an inch.

Zhang Qing’s expression changed; astonishment so extreme it was plainly written in his eyes.

If Qian Tong and Lin Yurao could match him, he could understand — after all, they were also Third Stage. But what of this youth? He was clearly only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, so how had he brought his Shi to minor accomplishment? He seemed to withstand Zhang Qing’s Shi even more easily than the other two.

The violent pressure of Shi that would overwhelm others brushed past him like a gentle breeze, unable to budge him in the slightest!

Zhang Qing stared at Yang Kai, shaken to his core.

"Minor accomplishment Shi!" Yang Kai nodded lightly, amusement playing on his lips. "Not bad."

As he spoke he casually glanced around. Since Zhang Qing and the others had arrived, countless pairs of eyes had been watching this way, eager for the scene of a great battle; some faces flickered with uncertainty, as if hiding schemes.

Yang Kai read their expressions. He knew that if he did not show sufficient strength this time, even if he forced Zhang Qing and the others to retreat, others might come to provoke and make trouble without end.

After all, their greatest weakness was simply their scarcity of numbers.

A cold smile curled in his heart as Yang Kai pointed toward a martial artist behind Zhang Qing and asked, "You said earlier you encountered a yao woman?"

The man was taken aback, wondering why Yang Kai would bring that up now. His face went cold and he answered in a low voice, "So?"

"Was that yao woman wearing red?"

"Yes."

"Did you wound her?" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; a dangerous glint sparked within them.

A sneer twisted the man’s face. “Heh, you’re damn right I did! Too bad it was only one strike — I didn’t manage to kill her.”

"Good!" Yang Kai nodded. At that, his figure suddenly blurred and in the next instant he was gone as if evaporating into thin air.

Though the event had been sudden, Zhang Qing and the others did not react slowly — anyone who had refined to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm had survived countless battles to the death. Startled, they all widened their eyes and searched for Yang Kai’s trace.

But they found nothing! There was no sign of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s figure appeared like a specter among them. Cold-faced, he spread his fingers and snatched at the head of the man who had spoken.

"Watch out!" someone shouted.

The man, furious, lunged to strike back, but Yang Kai had already clamped his head in his great hand. Saint Yuan surged forth in abundance, crazily poured into the man’s body, shattering layer after layer of his Saint Yuan defenses like a blade through bamboo. It flooded his viscera; with a step of his foot and a twist of his arm, Yang Kai threw him.

That martial artist was flung out.

Mid-air he let out a hideous scream, as if being subjected to unspeakable torments. Then came a dull thud as he struck the ground and his body suddenly burst apart.

Blood and entrails scattered, the stench of gore rising up!

"Forgot to tell you — that yao woman is my woman!" Yang Kai’s face twisted into a feral snarl.

Everyone froze.

Their gazes trembled as they stared at the bits of flesh and blood raining from the sky, at Yang Kai’s imperious figure that had plunged into the heart of danger as if unaware of it; in that moment they even forgot to breathe.

With a single strike he had killed a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm martial artist outright; such a thing was beyond the capability of any Third Stage warrior.

Only a Void King Realm expert could do that!

Yet that murderous youth was only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his cultivation lower than any present!

The subtle gap in Stage, the violent visual contradiction, the unforeseeable outcome — together they formed a stark contrast in the minds of everyone that left them aghast.

Those who had previously considered making a move against Yang Kai and had held back broke out in a cold sweat, secretly grateful they had not taken advantage of Yang Kai’s small company — otherwise their own fates might have been miserable.

"You brat, you dare!" Zhang Qing finally recovered and roared, launching a vicious punch at the nearby Yang Kai; his fire-infused Shi also surged toward Yang Kai.

His fist seemed to blaze; the intense heat warped the space. As his punch struck, a fire-dragon-like attack lashed toward Yang Kai with twisting, snapping force.

At the moment he struck, his companions also produced their secret treasures; Saint Yuan surged, the treasures’ radiance flared.

Suddenly, a marvelous Shi broke through Zhang Qing’s seal and pressed back at them.

In that instant everyone’s qi was brutally forced back into their bodies, unable to be released outward.

Moreover, the space grew solid, making movement difficult; even their Saint Yuan circulation seemed affected, and the luster of their secret treasures dimmed.

Shi suppression!

They all knew exactly what it was — they had fallen into Yang Kai’s Shi and could not break free; this was the very method they used when dealing with weaker enemies, and it had never failed.

Now they were being suppressed by a Second Stage martial artist.

It would be unbelievable if they told others, but it was the truth!

Their eyeballs trembled and muscles bulged as they desperately pushed their Saint Yuan, attempting to shake off Yang Kai’s suppression.

Qian Tong and Lin Yurao gave them no breathing room.

Qian Tong let out a fierce howl, flicked out a coin-sized secret treasure with two fingers; the coin emitted dazzling gold light and instantly multiplied into two, then four, then eight...

The sky filled with golden coins. From the central hole of each coin shot forth razor-sharp attacks that swarmed the enemies, the onslaught terrifying as if a plague of locusts passed.

As Lin Yurao twisted her delicate body, a multicolored ribbon flew from her hand; in its glittering light it wrapped around an enemy and bound him tightly. Bones cracked within that man’s body, and blood fouled his mouth.

When the ribbon returned to Lin Yurao’s hand, the man lay like putty on the ground, barely breathing.

Yang Kai laughed madly, paying no heed to anyone other than Zhang Qing. The rest could be handled by Qian Tong and Lin Yurao — either of them was no weaker than Zhang Qing, and with the two joining forces, dealing with those enemies already suppressed by his field of force was hardly an issue.

He divided his attention, portioning part of his Shi to contend with Zhang Qing’s, and with a thought moved.

To the sound of shrill bird calls, the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird flashed into view.

"Get him!" Yang Kai snarled, leaping at Zhang Qing as Fire Bird beat its wings and fell like a meteor from the heavens to hover above Zhang Qing’s head, opening its beak and continuously spitting fireballs charged with violent power.

Zhang Qing’s face changed drastically; he had not expected affairs to turn out like this. The screams at his ears filled him with terror, and the joint assault by Yang Kai and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird left him hard-pressed to respond.

Barely three breaths later, Zhang Qing was pierced through the abdomen by Yang Kai’s Heaven-Slaying Spear, and Fire Bird seized the chance to slam a fireball directly into his forehead.

Zhang Qing’s hair was scorched into a mess, his appearance utterly disheveled. Gritting his teeth, he glared at Yang Kai, a look of deep venom flashing across his face. Suddenly, a terrifying aura surged from within his body, faintly accompanied by the rumble of thunder, and thin arcs of lightning began crackling across his skin — a sight as shocking as it was fierce.

Gold light blazed; Yang Kai snapped his fingers and shot out Golden Blood Threads, catching Zhang Qing unawares and binding him.

Watching him with relish, Yang Kai sneered low, "You think I don’t know you cultivated Qiantian Thunderfire? You planned to use that secret art to die with me?"

"How do you know that?" Zhang Qing’s face changed.

"Because I killed a few of your Fire Radiance Sect people in the Imperial Garden, so I know," Yang Kai said coldly, and the Golden Blood Threads binding Zhang Qing suddenly tightened.

With a ripping sound...

The razor-sharp Golden Blood Threads tore through Zhang Qing’s Saint Yuan defenses, slicing him into countless pieces; his shredded corpse fell to the ground.

The great battle ended...

It had taken no more than ten breaths — so fast it left people breathless.

On Chi Lan Star’s side, the six from Fire Radiance Sect, led by Zhang Qing, were completely annihilated.

By contrast, Yang Kai and his two companions were unscathed.

The entire scene was stupefying!

Every martial artist gazed at Yang Kai as one would at a monster, disbelief shining in their eyes.

They had watched the whole battle from beginning to end and thus knew precisely how much Yang Kai had contributed.

One could say he alone suppressed Zhang Qing and his five companions; if it had not been for the strength of his Shi, Qian Tong and Lin Yurao would not have been able to cut down the enemies so effortlessly!

Among those six, aside from Zhang Qing, who could barely project his Shi outward, the other five were completely unable to release theirs — their Shi was entirely suppressed within their bodies, rendering it useless.

If one can’t wield their Shi, can they even be said to stand in the Origin Returning Realm?
