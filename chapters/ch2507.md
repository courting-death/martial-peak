## Chapter 2507 — The Damaged Small Xuan Realm

As soon as he entered the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai’s expression changed dramatically. He looked around in shock and cried out, “Th-this… what happened here?”

Although he had mentally prepared himself, knowing that extracting a strand of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth would have some effect on the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai never imagined the impact would be so immense.

At this moment, the Small Xuan Realm was riddled with scars and devastation. The ground was crisscrossed with ravines, as if the great battle between Duan Hongchen and Wu Kuang had taken place here.

The flowers, grasses, and lush trees that once filled the land had vanished in large swathes, and even the dense Spiritual Qi had dimmed noticeably.

The entire Small Xuan Realm seemed lifeless, as if the end of days had arrived.

Yang Kai's heart ached at the sight. Ever since he obtained the Xuan Realm Pearl on Dark Star, this spatial treasure had provided him with countless conveniences, saving him from danger many times. He never expected it to end up like this.

The Incarnation stood beside Yang Kai, also wearing a pained expression. In a buzzing voice, he said, “Wu Kuang said that the Great Might of Heaven and Earth is the Origin Power of Heaven And Earth. Since you extracted a strand of this world’s Origin, it’s only natural there would be consequences.”

“What about Liu Yan and the others? Are they alright?” Yang Kai asked anxiously, spreading out his Divine Sense to check on Liu Yan and the others.

The Incarnation replied, “They’re fine, but Ruoxi and Miss Xiaoqi are still asleep. Who knows when they’ll wake up.”

Yang Kai nodded. In a flash, he arrived at the place where Liu Yan and the others were, and as the Incarnation had said, Zhang Ruoxi and Mo Xiaoqi were still in deep slumber.

Earlier, Mo Xiaoqi’s emotional outburst had triggered the Sacred Soul Seal. Later, Duan Hongchen used a drop of Zhang Ruoxi’s Essence-Blood to seal it, causing her to fall unconscious. The two girls had likely overexerted themselves, but now their breathing was steady. Though asleep, they were not in any real danger.

After checking for a while, Yang Kai finally relaxed and shifted his Divine Sense to the medicine garden. He found that the Everlasting Tree, Firmament Tree, and all the rare flowers and herbs he had planted there were unharmed, which truly put his mind at ease.

If the Everlasting Tree or Firmament Tree had been affected, Yang Kai would be at a complete loss.

Fortunately, although the Small Xuan Realm was badly damaged, the truly important things remained untouched. It was a blessing in misfortune.

Still… how was he supposed to repair this ruined Small Xuan Realm? Yang Kai felt a headache coming on. Although he was skilled in space powers, the Small Xuan Realm wasn’t something he had refined himself. Even if he wanted to fix it, he had no idea where to start.

In the Origin Sea, the Xuan Realm Pearl had absorbed a massive amount of Origin Power, which now filled the world. But due to the damage, the Spiritual Qi and Origin Power stored in the Small Xuan Realm were constantly leaking away.

It was easy to imagine that if he didn’t find a solution, sooner or later all the Spiritual Qi and Origin Power would be gone. When that happened, the Small Xuan Realm would no longer be a good place for Liu Yan and the others to cultivate.

As he pondered, Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly lit up.

The reason the Small Xuan Realm had become like this was because he had extracted its Great Might of Heaven and Earth. Ultimately, it was due to the loss of a strand of the world’s origin.

If he could restore that missing strand of World Origin, the Small Xuan Realm should be able to return to its former state!

Origin Power filled the entire world, but unless one was a Great Emperor, it was impossible to sense it. Yang Kai couldn’t either, but he had a ready source of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth—suppressed beneath the Mountain and River Bell.

If he could infuse the Great Might of Heaven and Earth suppressed under the Mountain and River Bell into the Small Xuan Realm, would it have a miraculous effect?

That suppressed Great Might of Heaven and Earth was far greater than what he had extracted. If used well, not only could it repair the Small Xuan Realm, it might even make it better than before, perfecting the world’s laws.

At this thought, Yang Kai couldn’t help but grow excited, eager to give it a try.

After all, if he did nothing, the Small Xuan Realm would eventually become a broken world. But if he succeeded, the benefits were obvious.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and he reappeared in the oasis. He then waved his hand, releasing the Incarnation, Liu Yan, and the unconscious Zhang Ruoxi and Mo Xiaoqi.

“Does Master have any instructions?” Liu Yan asked curiously, looking at Yang Kai.

Normally, Yang Kai would never release them all from the Small Xuan Realm. If he did, it meant something important was about to happen.

Yang Kai said solemnly, “I’m going to repair the Small Xuan Realm. It may not be safe for you to stay inside.”

“Repair the Small Xuan Realm?” The Incarnation’s eyes flashed with doubt, but he quickly understood and exclaimed, “Are you going to use that suppressed Great Might of Heaven and Earth?”

Yang Kai nodded and said in a deep voice, “It’s the only possibility. I have to try.”

The Incarnation pondered for a moment and said, “It’s worth a shot.”

“But before that, Liu Yan, I have something for you!” Yang Kai’s gaze burned as he looked at Liu Yan.

“The True Phoenix Fire?” Liu Yan’s breath caught slightly.

“So you sensed it.” Yang Kai grinned.

After collecting the True Phoenix Fire in the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai had tossed it into the Small Xuan Realm. Once Liu Yan entered, she naturally sensed it.

The True Phoenix Fire was a relic of the Martial Flame Great Emperor, the Origin Power of the Fire Phoenix. Since Liu Yan’s true form was a fire-type Artifact Spirit, there was a subtle connection between them. Moreover, Liu Yan had refined a Luan Feng feather before.

Whether it was the Fire Phoenix or the Luan Feng, both were branches of the Phoenix Clan, sharing the same origin.

Since Liu Yan could refine the Luan Feng feather and possess a trace of its abilities, there was no reason she couldn’t refine the True Phoenix Fire.

However, it would certainly be extremely dangerous, with the risk of her soul being destroyed at any moment.

Yang Kai said solemnly, “Liu Yan, the True Phoenix Fire is the Origin Power of the Fire Phoenix. If you succeed in refining it, you can inherit the Fire Phoenix’s legacy and truly be reborn. In time, you might even become a true Fire Phoenix. But you know the risks—one misstep and you’ll be burned to death. You…”

Before Yang Kai could finish, Liu Yan interrupted, “Master, I’m already prepared.”

Yang Kai was slightly surprised. He studied her for a moment before nodding, “Your path is your own to choose. Since you’re ready, I won’t say more. Just… be careful!”

Liu Yan pressed her red lips together and said softly, “If I fail to refine it, please don’t grieve for me, Master. I’m just an Artifact Spirit, born by chance. To have followed you all these years, to be treated with such care, I’m already content. In this life, I’ve lived like a real person. That’s enough.”

As she spoke, her eyes reddened with emotion, but as a puppet body, she couldn’t shed a single tear.

Yang Kai said gently, “Meeting you, walking this path together, supporting each other along the way—that has been my good fortune as well. Don’t overthink it. I believe you will succeed.”

Liu Yan nodded firmly. “I won’t let you down, Master!”

Yang Kai’s expression grew serious. He suddenly activated the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power within him, and a huge, dazzling golden dragon head appeared behind him, baring its fangs and claws.

He reached into the Xuan Realm Pearl, grabbed fiercely, and pulled out the True Phoenix Fire.

In the dragon’s claw, the True Phoenix Fire looked like a living little phoenix, flapping its wings as if to fly away, but it was tightly bound by the Golden Sacred Dragon’s origin.

“Catch!” Yang Kai shouted, slowly pressing the True Phoenix Fire toward Liu Yan.

Liu Yan took a deep breath, her face instantly becoming calm as still water. She opened her mouth and swallowed the True Phoenix Fire.

Immediately, her figure flickered and she shot like lightning into the depths of the desert, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Soon, an extremely intense wave of heat erupted from that direction. A ball of fire blazed fiercely, and from the yellow sands came a clear, resounding phoenix cry that echoed to the heavens.

Yang Kai’s expression was solemn as he released his Divine Sense, carefully monitoring the situation.

If it weren’t absolutely necessary, he wouldn’t have let Liu Yan refine the True Phoenix Fire at this time.

He had originally planned to wait until Liu Yan was stronger before giving her the True Phoenix Fire, but now that the Small Xuan Realm was so badly damaged and could collapse at any moment, it was no longer suitable to store the True Phoenix Fire there.

Besides, the True Phoenix Fire could only be stored in the Small Xuan Realm. A Spatial Ring couldn’t contain it at all.

If the Small Xuan Realm collapsed, this precious True Phoenix Fire could be swallowed by a void rift and never be found again.

With no other choice, Yang Kai could only let Liu Yan refine it now.

Still, Yang Kai had made thorough preparations. If Liu Yan succeeded, that would be best. If the process went awry, he would intervene immediately, using his Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power and the Mountain and River Bell to suppress it.

He was confident that Liu Yan wouldn’t be in any real danger.

He hadn’t told Liu Yan any of this, because he didn’t want her to have any false hope, thinking it would be fine even if she failed.

Only by putting her in a life-or-death situation could he force out Liu Yan’s full potential.

Probing with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai’s expression grew grave.

Over there, Liu Yan—who was refining the True Phoenix Fire—was completely engulfed in flames. The phantom of the Fire Phoenix appeared behind her small body, its majestic phoenix eyes staring coldly at her, clearly unwilling to be refined.

Fortunately, Liu Yan had a puppet body and was an Artifact Spirit of fire. Over the years, she had even swallowed Sun’s True Fire, so she had a strong resistance and adaptability to such scorching power.

She continuously activated her own power to resist the terrifying might of the True Phoenix Fire. Instead of rushing to refine and absorb it, she released her Divine Sense to communicate and soothe it.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he realized he had been worrying too much.

Liu Yan wasn’t a child—she had her own ideas. By communicating with the True Phoenix Fire like this, if she did it well, she might get it to recognize her as its master, allowing her to refine it without any danger at all.

The most crucial thing now was how to gain the True Phoenix Fire’s approval.

Yang Kai stared intently, not daring to miss a single detail.
