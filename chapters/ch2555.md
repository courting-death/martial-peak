## Chapter 2555 — Really Going to Kill

"My Netherworld Sect... will never let you off!"

A faint, almost whisper-like voice sounded from nearby. Yang Kai turned his head and saw Hua Feichen lying on the ground, life ebbing away. His eyes were wide open, staring in his direction, but they were dull and gray—like the eyes of a dead fish, lifeless for days.

After saying this, his head lolled to the side, and he was completely lifeless.

Struck by the Years Like a Shuttle Seal, he had forced himself to hold on until now before dying. He was quite tenacious.

Yang Kai paid no mind to the threats of the dead. He reached out and flicked the Spatial Ring from Yin Lesheng's hand, tossing it into his own pocket.

This was the chief disciple of the Netherworld Sect, surely carrying plenty of valuable items. How could Yang Kai miss out?

Before he could turn to deal with Hua Feichen's body, Yang Kai's expression suddenly changed. He hurriedly threw away the Emperor Extinction Pill he was holding.

Bang...

With a loud explosion, the Emperor Extinction Pill burst apart, turning to dust and scattering in the air.

Yang Kai's face was clouded and uncertain. His good mood was instantly ruined, and he gritted his teeth, "A restriction!"

He didn't know what kind of restriction had been placed on the Emperor Extinction Pill, but it was certainly tied to Yin Lesheng's life. After all, this was a protective treasure bestowed upon Yin Lesheng by the Netherworld Sect Master. With Yin Lesheng dead, the restriction was triggered, and the Emperor Extinction Pill was wasted for nothing.

Yang Kai was heartbroken, but at this point, it was useless to dwell on it. He could only collect himself, walk over to Hua Feichen, and take his Spatial Ring as well.

The out-of-control Ghost King was no longer a threat. Countless Soul-Devouring Worms were gnawing at it, treating it as a delicious feast. It wouldn't be long before it was completely devoured.

More than twenty corpses lay scattered across the ground, the stench of blood thick in the air.

Yang Kai himself was injured. The wound left by the Ghost King's scythe still hadn't healed, and the flesh around the torn edges was wrapped in black energy, constantly corroding.

Yang Kai beckoned, and a small swarm of Soul-Devouring Worms flew over, landing on his wound.

Since the Soul-Devouring Worms could eat the Ghost King, they could surely handle its chilling energy. Summoning them was to treat his injury. As he expected, once the Soul-Devouring Worms entered his wound, they diligently devoured away.

In just a short while, the black energy was completely consumed. With the chilling energy gone, the powerful regenerative ability of Yang Kai's Golden Blood finally kicked in. The flesh at the wound began to squirm, and it would likely heal in a few days.

Only then did Yang Kai turn his head to look at the red-clothed young woman.

As their eyes met, Lin'er couldn't help but swallow nervously. Despite her earlier bravado, she was actually terrified. She had never seen anyone so ruthless, able to fight alone against many and slaughter all his enemies. And these weren't ordinary people—they were two Emperor Realm experts from the Netherworld Sect, plus a group of Dao Origin Realm cultivators who had set up the Heaven Net Sealing Array.

Coupled with the huge wound on Yang Kai's chest, he looked even more ferocious.

Seeing Yang Kai looking her way, Lin'er couldn't help but feel nervous—she'd be lying if she said otherwise. Regret welled up inside her; if only she'd listened to Elder Fu and fled, instead of stubbornly staying here to act tough.

She didn't consider that with Yang Kai's abilities, even if she tried to escape, she wouldn't get far—unless she and Elder Fu retreated through the Ancient Land passage, using the strange mist to shake off Yang Kai.

Rustle, rustle, rustle...

Yang Kai walked toward them step by step, his gaze icy cold, putting immense pressure on Lin'er.

Elder Fu, intent on protecting his mistress, flashed in front of Lin'er, his face full of vigilance.

"At least you're behaving," Yang Kai said, stopping three zhang away from them. He leveled his sword at them, his voice icy. "Since you’re so obedient, I’ll give you a quick death. Tell me—how do you want to die?"

Elder Fu panicked at this. Was this guy really serious? Who else in the world would dare point a sword at his young lady and ask how she wanted to die? Judging by Yang Kai's murderous look, he truly didn't intend to let them go.

It made sense. Earlier, he had been bound by the Imperial Treasure and nearly killed by the Netherworld Sect people. Anyone would be angry.

But how could the young lady die? If she died, chaos would erupt across the land.

Elder Fu said gravely, "Young Master, it's better to resolve enmity than create it. We were in the wrong this time. Please show mercy and pretend today's events never happened."

"Pretend it never happened?" Yang Kai glanced at him, full of anger, and snorted, "Is the wound on my body fake? How can I pretend it never happened?"

The wound hadn't healed yet, with white bone still exposed. How could it be ignored?

Elder Fu's face darkened. "I'm saying this for your own good. If you remain stubborn, disaster will surely befall you."

Yang Kai laughed in anger. "I know you have powerful backers, but so what? Now that you're in my hands, your lives are mine to decide. Losers should accept their fate. Still so arrogant—do you believe I won't stab you right now?"

As he spoke, Yang Kai twisted his sword, pressing it against Elder Fu's chest. With a flick of his wrist, the sharp tip cut through Elder Fu's clothes, scaring him into retreating a step. The aura he had forced up instantly vanished, like a wilted eggplant.

He was genuinely afraid that Yang Kai, in a fit of rage, might stab him right then and there. If the young lady were killed, this madman would surely face disaster—but if he died, there’d be no one to stand up for him.

He was just a bodyguard, responsible for protecting the young lady. Now he couldn't even protect his own life, let alone hers.

He'd run into someone who didn't care about their own life!

Elder Fu was full of regret. If he'd known this man was so strong, or that the Netherworld Sect people were so useless, he would never have sought them out or provoked Yang Kai with his young lady.

But then again, who could have guessed a First Stage Emperor would be so fierce?

"Th-then what do you want?" Elder Fu's tone softened, asking weakly.

Now he was at someone else's mercy. He had no choice but to bow his head. Any humiliation could be set aside for now—survival came first. A gentleman's revenge can wait ten years.

Yang Kai's face darkened. "Vengeance for vengeance, hatred for hatred. I've said it before: once is forgivable, twice is tolerable, but three times is too much. Your young lady is too stubborn—sooner or later she'll cause a disaster. Maybe I should clean house for your master now and save him the trouble."

Elder Fu was shocked. So all his words had fallen on deaf ears—this man was still intent on killing the young lady. What now?

He didn't dare hesitate any longer and quickly said, "Do you know who we are? Do you know who my young lady is? She is—"

"Get out of the way!" Yang Kai didn't let him finish and kicked him hard.

Elder Fu couldn't defend himself. He watched as the big foot came at his face, screamed, and was sent flying. His nose was nearly broken, and he lay on the ground groaning, unable to get up.

After dealing with Elder Fu, Yang Kai glared at the red-clothed girl and said sternly, "You troublesome little demon, I spared you once in Desolate City, and you didn't show any gratitude. Instead, you teamed up with the Netherworld Sect to bully me. Today, I'll take your life and show you there are people in this world you can't afford to offend."

Lin'er was terrified, her face pale. "You dare!"

Before she could finish, she saw Yang Kai raise his sword and strike at her.

In an instant, Lin'er's pretty face turned deathly pale. The aura of death enveloped her, making her whole body cold and her limbs numb.

She had never experienced anything like this. From childhood, she had lived a life of privilege—pampered and respected, her every command obeyed wherever she went. No one had ever dared defy her, let alone threaten her life.

But now, someone really wanted her dead—not just saying it, but actually doing it.

She was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and had exhausted herself using the Imperial Treasure earlier. Now she could barely stand, let alone defend against this attack.

Death... so this is what it feels like?

Is someone really going to kill me? Lin'er was stunned, as if frozen in place.

The Myriad Sword slashed down from the sky. Yang Kai showed no mercy. With Emperor Yuan surging, even if Elder Fu stood in front, he would be split in two—let alone the delicate Lin'er.

But just as the Myriad Sword was about to strike, a pitch-black pendant on Lin'er's neck suddenly shattered, turning into a dark barrier that enveloped her.

Boom...

With a loud crash, the Myriad Sword struck the barrier, unable to harm it at all. Instead, Yang Kai was sent stumbling back several steps.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, showing no surprise, as if he had expected this. He stared coldly at the dark barrier and snorted.

After protecting Lin'er, the barrier immediately turned into a black light, circled the area, and shot into the fallen Elder Fu.

Buzz...

Heaven and earth buzzed. An unimaginable pressure suddenly spread out, its source clearly where Elder Fu lay.

Crash...

Within a hundred li, birds and beasts scattered, sensing danger and fleeing for their lives.

Yang Kai couldn't help but swallow nervously, secretly on guard.

He was all too familiar with this scene—it was clearly an expert's Soul Descent.

Back in the Shattered Star Sea, Feng Xi had pulled this trick, and Yang Kai remembered it well.

These elite disciples from top sects all seemed to have hidden trump cards. The Emperor Extinction Pill was the most common, but Soul Descent was even more formidable. That was a true expert's Divine Soul descending. Though it couldn't unleash the expert's full power, it was still not something ordinary people could handle.

An expert's Soul Descent brought not just pressure in terms of strength, but also awe and fear due to reputation.

There were only so many top experts. Once a Divine Soul descended, who would dare take them lightly?

Feng Xi could have his father descend into the Shattered Star Sea, so naturally this Lin'er could have her own backer descend here.

Yang Kai had known this would happen all along, so he never expected to actually kill Lin'er. Still, it was frustrating not to vent his anger.
