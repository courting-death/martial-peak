## Chapter 1648 — Defying the Dao

Ran Yunting's expression did not change; she only fixed a cold gaze on Yang Kai and said with deadly calm, "This ends here!"

The reinforcements sent by the many elders made her once again see hope of killing Yang Kai.

“Die!” Yang Kai suddenly shouted in a low voice.

The other four streams of colored radiance that flowed across his body leisurely split away, all pouring into the Golden Sword and fusing with it.

The five-colored light sword immediately took form!

The sword contained the power of the Five Elements, each restraining and nourishing the others; the cycle of elemental qi turned without pause, and the sword's might abruptly surged.

Crackle…

The ice wall blocking Ran Yunting burst with the sound of shattering, cleaving open clear fissures.

Ran Yunting's face changed in shock; Bing Long and the other elders stood as if turned to wood.

With a clang, the ice wall was completely smashed, and the five-colored light sword shot forth in an exceedingly sharp posture, aiming straight for Ran Yunting's brow!

It looked like Ice Heart Valley's Great Elder was about to be sent to the Yellow Springs, when at that moment a pale, delicate jade-like palm suddenly and strangely materialized.

That jade-like hand appeared pure and flawless, with slender fingers as tender as fresh shoots emerging from water. The hand gently closed, as if merely grasping something insignificant.

An utterly abstruse, indescribable power emanated from that jade-like palm.

The five-colored light sword that had broken the ice wall was somehow held in the palm; the sword trembled violently yet could not advance an inch.

"Little one, show mercy where mercy can be shown; why pursue slaughter to the last?" a clear, cold female voice sounded in the void.

Yang Kai's brow furrowed; his eyes narrowed.

Having just made a trip to the gates of hell, Ran Yunting’s body was drenched in sweat. But upon seeing that jade hand and hearing the clear, cold female voice, she was suddenly overjoyed and cried out loudly, “This disciple thanks the Grand Elder for saving my life! I beg the Grand Elder to strike once more and slay this wretch who dares insult Ice Heart Valley!”

Grand Elder?

Yang Kai's face grew serious; he looked up toward a certain direction but could see no figure.

He knew Ice Heart Valley had a Grand Elder stationed there — a Void King Realm expert, though only at the First Stage.

Even someone like Luo Hai, whom Yang Kai had offended and who drove him fleeing across the Star Domain, could not make Yang Kai tremble; even if Ice Heart Valley's Void King expert was powerful, Yang Kai was not afraid.

That was why he dared come to Ice Heart Valley!

He silently grew wary. His Saint Yuan lay hidden, not released!

On the other side, Bing Long was greatly alarmed, fearing the Grand Elder might angrily slay Yang Kai; she hurriedly said, "Grand Elder, please show restraint; there may be some misunderstanding here — let Bing Long handle this matter!"

Yang Kai's existence was of great consequence; Bing Long did not dare let him die casually.

The clear, cold female voice sounded again, but this time she did not speak; she only sighed faintly, and the jade hand that had held the five-colored sword suddenly disintegrated and vanished.

Yang Kai's thought moved; he drew the five-colored light sword into his body and stared coldly at Ran Yunting.

She looked back at him, teeth clenched, bitterly unwilling.

She seemed extremely vexed that the Grand Elder had not simply killed Yang Kai outright; after all, Yang Kai had made such a commotion just now, and in front of so many eyes he had even tried to slay her, a Great Elder.

Such provocation and humiliation were things Ran Yunting could never tolerate.

But faced with the Grand Elder's decision, she dared not voice any objection and could only brood in secret.

A graceful figure suddenly flew over from afar; as if by some psychic connection, Yang Kai looked toward her. The murderous aura that had filled him vanished as if it had never been, and a gentle smile appeared.

He looked that way, his gaze tender as water.

Bing Long and the others could not get used to his change. They all frowned, not knowing what was happening.

Following his gaze, once they saw the situation clearly, Bing Long showed a pensive expression.

Ran Yunting also saw the newcomer's face and her expression hardened; she was about to cry out when a fierce gaze suddenly fell upon her.

Turning, she saw Yang Kai staring at her as if saying, "If you dare mouth off, I'll kill you this instant."

Ran Yunting swallowed the words at her tongue and quietly swallowed.

She could not say whether she was imagining it, but in that instant she had the sensation of being stared at by an ancient ferocious beast; as if, if she provoked Yang Kai again, even the Grand Elder would be unable to save her life.

The thought chilled her to the bone...

The graceful figure made only a few rises and falls of flight before arriving one zhang in front of Yang Kai, hovering in the void; her beautiful eyes trembled, and she lightly bit her red lip.

As their gazes met, that face—usually cold as sculpted ice and carved jade—showed a faint smile.

For a moment, the picturesque beauty of Icebound Island dimmed in comparison.

Countless outer-island disciples on Icebound Island went slack-jawed, their eyes dazed.

"Heavens, Su Yan actually smiled? She smiled! And she smiled at a man."

"I thought she would never smile; does she know this man?"

"What are they to each other? They look so intimate."

"Su Yan actually has a man outside? That's unimaginable."

"No wonder she was punished by the Great Elder — inner-island disciples are forbidden from intimate contact with men without permission."

"Who is this fellow that could win Su Yan's heart..."

……

Murmurs rose from all sides. Ran Yunting's face was deathly pale; Bing Long shook her head with a sigh.

The remaining elders exchanged glances; none of them knew that Su Yan and Yang Kai had known each other long ago, so this sudden scene stunned them deeply.

Under the watch of countless eyes in the sky, Yang Kai reached out a hand toward Su Yan.

A faint flush bloomed on Su Yan's snow-white cheek, but her deep longing overcame her innate shyness; she swayed and fell into Yang Kai's embrace.

The two held each other tightly!

After more than thirty years, the two once of Lingxiao Pavilion were together again.

"When I embrace you, I embrace the whole world!"

The cold wind howled, snow gusted up, and Icebound Island fell deathly silent; every gaze froze in midair, fixed on the man and woman.

The scene was beautiful and tender, enough to drive away the chill — everyone felt their hearts warm.

Ran Yunting's expression shifted; she glanced toward Bing Long as if about to say something, but seeing Bing Long's helpless look she held her tongue.

"Su Yan, you wench, get back here at once!"

"How dare you act so — you will be punished!"

Two abrupt voices shattered the tender mood.

Many female disciples of Ice Heart Valley angrily glared toward the source of the voices, secretly blaming the rashness and recklessness of the newcomers.

Two flashes of radiance streaked; very soon two women hurried over — the voices had come from them.

Once they saw the situation, both Zhou Yunxuan and the other woman responsible for watching Su Yan stood dumbstruck; they had not expected such a gathering of the sect's high elders.

One could say all the sect's elders were present.

The two women looked sheepish and timidly glanced at Ran Yunting.

No matter what, it was true that Ran Yunting valued Su Yan greatly. If she were to find out they had insulted Su Yan, they would certainly suffer the consequences.

But as they looked they were secretly delighted.

Ran Yunting seemed not to have heard the earlier words; she paid them no heed and instead glared in a certain direction, her gaze full of hatred and fury.

Following her gaze, Zhou Yunxuan cried out and clapped a hand over her mouth.

She was shocked to find Su Yan clinging to a stranger.

This… this was simply too defiant, too heretical!

Not to mention ordinary inner-island disciples — who are forbidden by the master to have intimate contact with outsiders — Su Yan was the Great Elder's favored direct disciple; for someone of her status to be so public with a man was a slap in the Great Elder's face.

Did she even regard the Great Elder as her master?

No wonder the Great Elder's face looked so dreadful.

Thinking of this, Zhou Yunxuan hurriedly said, “Great Elder, Su Yan ignored the advice of me and my Junior Sister and insisted on rushing out. I thought she had some urgent matter, but I never expected this. To act like this before so many people—how utterly shameless! I ask the Great Elder to mete out punishment!”

Ran Yunting's body trembled and rage covered her face.

There was no need for Zhou Yunxuan to speak; if it were possible, Ran Yunting would have torn Yang Kai to pieces on the spot!

But she admitted she did not have that ability; to kill Yang Kai she would need the Grand Elder to act personally.

So she fell silent and did not answer Zhou Yunxuan.

Zhou Yunxuan paused, a hint of suspicion flashing across her face.

As she wondered, a cold, ruthless voice sounded at her ear: "Was that you just insulting Su Yan?"

Lifting her head, Zhou Yunxuan suddenly saw that the man who had just been holding Su Yan was now standing high in midair, his cold eyes fixed upon her.

Su Yan, disregarding the scandal she caused, nestled against him like a songbird, her pretty face full of contentment, as if she would die satisfied right then.

Under that gaze, Zhou Yunxuan felt an inexplicable chill. She glanced around and saw the elders were silent; she clenched her teeth and replied, "I spoke out of turn just now."

Whether Su Yan was wrong or not, to insult a fellow disciple was improper; in front of so many elders and the Valley Lord, she dared not be impertinent and immediately admitted her fault.

"Apologize!" Yang Kai said tersely.

Anger flitted across Zhou Yunxuan's face; she snapped, "Who do you think you are, to boss me around!"

Admitting wrongdoing is one thing; apologizing is another. Zhou Yunxuan refused to publicly apologize to Su Yan — that would be too humiliating.

As her words fell, a crisp smack rang across her cheek; Zhou Yunxuan felt her face go numb as a great force swept her into the air, spun her several times, and sent her crashing heavily into the snow.

The elders of Ice Heart Valley turned ashen.

They had not seen how Yang Kai struck; they only saw the disciple Zhou Yunxuan hurtled away.
