## Chapter 543 — You Have No Right to Judge Me

“I, Yang Zhao, though cunning and treacherous, would never use such dishonorable methods to defeat Ninth Brother! In the Succession War, I have wielded all means in battling Ninth Brother’s wit and courage. If I lose, it is without complaint! Lowly maid, you have no right to judge me. If you dare speak such words again, I won’t hesitate to make you the first young lady from the super families to die in this Succession War... Whatever Ninth Brother dares to do, I dare to do as well, and I will do it even more ruthlessly!”

Yang Zhao’s hoarse, low voice sounded like a summoning call from a demon in the depths of hell, and in Ye Xinrou’s beautiful eyes, fear and horror rapidly overflowed.

Staring into Yang Zhao’s eyes, Ye Xinrou truly became afraid.

She could tell Yang Zhao was not merely trying to intimidate her; if she continued speaking disrespectfully and enraging him, she might very well die here.

“I was wrong, I dare not speak again,” Ye Xinrou immediately backed down. As a woman, she felt no shame admitting this.

Yang Zhao snorted coldly before releasing her.

Rising from the bed, Yang Zhao said, “Those people gathered at my residence only wanted to use my name. Even without me, they could use Eldest Brother’s name. Since the Yang Family allows them this, I cannot oppose it! However, it’s impossible for me to lead them against Ninth Brother! You shall go; from this moment on, you will take full control of all affairs in the residence!”

Still trembling in panic, Ye Xinrou’s breath quickened when she heard this and stammered, “Second Young Master, you…”

“No need to doubt it. This residence is yours from now on. The top experts from the Seven Great Families will now be under your complete command. You are also a woman who chases after power, right? If we didn’t share such dirty tastes, we wouldn’t have come together like this. Now is your chance.”

Ye Xinrou paid no heed to the sarcastic undertone in Yang Zhao’s words. Her cheeks flushed red, seeming extremely excited. After a moment's thought, she asked, “But... how should I explain this to the people in the residence?”

“Need to explain? I agree to let them use my name. As for outside explanations, say whatever you like,” Yang Zhao replied.

Ye Xinrou laughed, her smile blooming like a flower, coquettishly saying, “Second Young Master has suffered a setback but is not disheartened. Instead, he rises stronger from it. His Qi is fluctuating; he is on the verge of breakthrough and needs to retreat into seclusion to cultivate!”

“That’s very good,” Yang Zhao sneered repeatedly. “Looks like I should thank you for finding me a good excuse that saves me face.”

“We are family; there’s no need for formalities,” Ye Xinrou scolded him with a glance. “Perhaps one day I will truly become Second Young Master’s woman. I only hope that after Second Young Master ascends as the head of the Yang Family, he will care for my Ye Family a bit.”

Yang Zhao sneered, “You’ll have to survive Ninth Brother first before you can talk about that.”

Ye Xinrou’s expression twitched slightly, fear flashing instantly in her eyes. But she soon composed herself and said softly, “With the current lineup in the residence, Yang Kai no longer has any chance, right?”

Yang Zhao closed his eyes, saying no more.

“I shall take my leave now,” Ye Xinrou said gracefully as she stepped away.

Once outside, she looked up at the sky.

Night had fallen, and a full moon hung high overhead.

Ye Xinrou laughed, a very joyful smile. She glanced back once more at Yang Zhao’s room, a trace of disdain flashing in her beautiful eyes.

She hadn’t expected Yang Zhao to make such a decision. But since he had already handed over command to her, she could truly act freely now.

A look of excitement spread across her face, and soon her giggles echoed, chilling those who heard it.

Not long after, the leaders of the seven great forces at Yang Zhao’s residence gathered in a side hall.

Ye Xinrou sat at the main seat.

Below her were Liu Qingyao of the Liu Family, Kang Zhan of the Kang Family, Gao Rangfeng of the Gao Family, Qiu Yimeng of the Qiu Family, Huo Xingchen of the Huo Family, and Meng Shanyi of the Meng Family, all wearing complicated expressions as they gazed upon her.

Ye Xinrou’s expression was indifferent, elegant, and without a trace of unease.

Her peach-blossom eyes swept the group, and she spoke first, “Brother Meng, has Eldest Young Master not arrived?”

Meng Shanyi, the one addressed, involuntarily got goosebumps and said in a deep voice, “Eldest Young Master said he is about to break through soon and is currently in seclusion. This matter will be fully represented by me on behalf of Eldest Young Master’s residence.”

Ye Xinrou feigned surprise, covering her mouth and laughing coquettishly, “Ah, what a coincidence! Second Young Master is also about to breakthrough and must retreat into seclusion. He likely won’t emerge for some time. The Yang Family’s brothers really are interesting, breaking through together. They truly are dragons among men and truly worthy of respect.”

Hearing this, the others’ expressions changed slightly.

Huo Xingchen asked, “Miss Ye, with Second Young Master absent, who will be responsible for the Seven Great Families’ allied forces? It can’t be you, can it?”

“Exactly,” Ye Xinrou responded sweetly, changing her sitting posture with an alluring charm, “It will be me.”

Huo Xingchen chuckled.

“Second Young Master said before he emerges from seclusion, I take full charge of the residence’s affairs. Everyone must obey my orders!” Ye Xinrou’s expression turned stern, and in a delicate voice, she commanded.

The six others’ expressions became extremely strange.

“Are you all doubting Little Sister’s ability?” Ye Xinrou read their expressions with a smile and lightly inquired.

“Not at all,” Kang Zhan shook his head. “It’s just that such a major matter lacks the presence of Second Young Master himself. It seems improper for Miss Ye alone to speak for him. After all, we each follow orders from our respective families to assist Second Young Master.”

“Is Brother Kang doubting that I am falsely speaking in Second Young Master’s name?” Ye Xinrou laughed lightly. “I don’t have that boldness. If anyone doubts, you can ask Second Young Master yourself. He is in the residence.”

Kang Zhan frowned, slightly displeased but unready to argue further.

Since Ye Xinrou spoke this way, it was obvious she had Yang Zhao’s permission.

Huo Xingchen added, “Second Young Master’s absence is acceptable, but I think Miss Ye’s prestige may still fall short of commanding everyone fully.”

“Oh? Young Master Huo thinks so... then in your opinion, who can command the others?” Ye Xinrou said, her gaze piercing toward Qiu Yimeng, who remained expressionless.

Not only Ye Xinrou but most eyes now shifted to Qiu Yimeng.

Compared to Ye Xinrou, Qiu Yimeng was undoubtedly more suitable to lead Yang Zhao’s residence. She had the capability.

But she had been forced to leave Yang Kai’s residence just this morning. It would be inappropriate for her to take command here now.

Not to mention whether she desired it, the experts from the Seven Great Families would never agree nor obey her orders.

“What do you think, Sister Qiu?” Ye Xinrou challengingly stared at Qiu Yimeng.

Caught off guard, Qiu Yimeng reluctantly spoke, “Little Sister can do it. I believe in her ability.”

“If Sister says so, then Little Sister will not shirk the responsibility,” Ye Xinrou smiled knowingly, beaming proudly.

Huo Xingchen sighed deeply. He understood why Qiu Yimeng said nothing more, but despite understanding, he was boiling with silent anger.

Ye Xinrou now gave the strong impression of a petty person who had suddenly risen to power.

A delicate woman, charming in appearance and figure, yet Huo Xingchen felt no affection for her.

This was probably the first beauty that the wolf of Zhongdu, Young Master Huo, disliked.

“Let’s end this topic here.” Ye Xinrou’s expression grew solemn as she quickly established her authority at Yang Zhao’s residence, raising her voice: “Everyone here has received orders from their families and gathered with one goal—to bring down the arrogant and rampant Yang Kai. We all know well what will happen if we fail. Our strength indeed surpasses that of Yang Kai’s residence, and we have the conditions to accomplish this. But how to act, and how to break through Yang Kai’s defenses with the least cost—please share your thoughts. Little Sister is young and hopes for your guidance, brothers and sisters.”

Her enchanting eyes scanned the room as Ye Xinrou silently awaited replies.

Liu Qingyao kept his eyes closed, unwilling to speak.

Kang Zhan and Gao Rangfeng whispered together gravely, seeming to deliberate seriously.

Young Master Huo looked up, as if admiring a passing beauty in the sky.

Qiu Yimeng remained impassive and sorrowful.

Meng Shanyi scratched his head, helpless.

The six looked all different yet none spoke.

After a long moment, Ye Xinrou smiled and said, “Looks like none of you have good strategies. If so, how about listening to my suggestion?”

Without waiting for a response, she continued, “Although the residence now contains top experts from seven families, and countless exceptional cultivators, with overwhelming advantage, Yang Kai’s forces must not be underestimated. Over there, one beyond the Divine Roaming Realm’s level exists—Ling Taixu, the leader of the Evil Sect. Ling Taixu won’t act, of course, since it’s still the Succession War. The blood servants in his residence are limited due to the Yang Family’s previous repression and only two can be deployed now. But he has a demon-level expert, and another protector at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm... these few are the biggest trouble.”

“If we attack recklessly, unnecessary losses will occur. Yang Kai’s people must not be taken lightly. They often take unexpected actions. I think Young Master Huo and Sister Qiu understand this better than we do.”

Huo Xingchen chuckled, “Don’t ask me. I know nothing. Besides chasing women at his residence, I’ve done nothing else. There are so many beauties there...”

Ye Xinrou smiled warmly. “Young Master Huo is modest; everyone knows you have increased your power remarkably—even Brother Gao can’t match you.”

Gao Rangfeng’s face darkened as he silently cursed Ye Xinrou for touching a sore spot. That night when Yang Kai raided Yang Kang’s residence, Gao Rangfeng was defeated by the playboy Huo Xingchen. He took it as the greatest humiliation and has been training hard since, hoping to one day regain his honor.

Now Ye Xinrou brought it up, his anger immediately flared. He said flatly, “Miss Ye, please speak of the matter at hand.”

Ye Xinrou smiled slightly at him apologetically. “Brother Gao, no offense meant. It was unintentional. I apologize to you here.”

Gao Rangfeng’s expression softened somewhat.

Ye Xinrou continued, “Given these circumstances, I believe we should dispatch surprise forces and strike Yang Kai when he least expects it.”
