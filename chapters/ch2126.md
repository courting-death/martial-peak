## Chapter 2126 — For His Own Good

Wen Zishan said, "Elder Gao, that's the sort of thing men say to women... only in a special atmosphere and with ulterior motives. If this Young Brother said that to you, this Lord could understand; but for you to say it yourself... something feels off."

"Shut your mouth!" Gao Xueting snapped, her voice delicate yet commanding.

As soon as she spoke, Yang Kai stood stunned.

Qin Chaoyang was also dumbfounded, casting a strange look at Gao Xueting.

Although Gao Xueting was a First Stage Emperor Realm expert, within Qingyang Shrine she was only an elder, while Wen Zishan, seated above, was the Hall Master.

As an elder, she actually dared to tell the Hall Master to shut up?

Wasn’t that utterly rebellious?

Even more shocking to Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang was that Wen Zishan actually fell silent.

Looking around, the others didn’t seem surprised by this scene at all. No one blamed Gao Xueting for overstepping her rank; instead, a few people even cast disdainful glances at Wen Zishan!

Yang Kai’s mind was in chaos...

His first thought was—Wen Zishan sitting above must be a fake! That’s why Gao Xueting could show him no respect, and even the others could glare at him.

But thinking carefully, that didn’t seem likely. Just now, when Wen Zishan waved his hand, Yang Kai clearly felt the power surging within him.

He was definitely a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert.

In all of Qingyang Shrine, he was the only Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. If he wasn't Wen Zishan, who else could he be?

Yang Kai was thoroughly confused, feeling that the upper echelons of Qingyang Shrine were a bit odd.

"You still haven’t answered my question. Have I seen you somewhere before?" Gao Xueting turned to Yang Kai, pressing him relentlessly.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and said, "I'm from Fenglin City. Elder Gao came to Fenglin City last time to help Lord Xiao Yuyang open the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda. I was there and entered the trial... Maybe that's why I seem familiar to you."

"I see..." Gao Xueting mused, thinking his explanation made sense, and nodded. "That might be it!"

With that, she paid him no more attention.

Yang Kai immediately breathed a sigh of relief.

If, in this setting, Gao Xueting recognized him as the demon she’d fought before, Yang Kai figured his fate would be miserable.

Everyone waited quietly in the grand hall for a while. Suddenly, Chen Qian’s Transmission Compass pulsed with Divine Sense.

After checking, she looked up at Wen Zishan and shook her head. "Hall Master, there's no Calamity Fruit in our Treasure Vault!"

"That's truly disappointing..." Wen Zishan murmured.

Qin Chaoyang also looked disappointed.

After all, if they could get a Calamity Fruit right away, it would be best. Yang Kai wouldn’t have to risk entering the Four Seasons Realm. But since Qingyang Shrine didn’t have it, who knew what these Emperor Realm experts would decide next.

Wen Zishan said to Qin Chaoyang, "Since we don't have it, you'll have to go in and find it yourself; whether you succeed depends on your fortune."

Qin Chaoyang was overjoyed at these words.

Gao Xueting frowned slightly. She seemed to want to say something, but since Wen Zishan had spoken, she couldn’t interrupt.

"Many thanks, Hall Master." Qin Chaoyang bowed deeply. "However... Qin has one more request!"

Wen Zishan smiled. "Let’s hear it. As long as it’s not too much..."

Qin Chaoyang said, "Qin requests that Hall Master give the spot to enter the Four Seasons Realm to Brother Yang!"

As he spoke, he pointed at Yang Kai, looking embarrassed. "I’m sure you all see it. Qin is old, and though I’m a First Stage Dao Origin Realm, I know my own strength. Elder Gao said it herself—if I go in, I might not make it out alive. My death is a small matter, but if we don’t get the Calamity Fruit..."

"So you mean, if he goes in, he’ll make it out alive?" Wen Zishan asked with interest.

Qin Chaoyang replied, "Brother Yang is far stronger than Qin."

"At least you know your limits!" Wen Zishan smiled gently. "Since you’ve asked, this Lord will allow it! That person only said to give you a spot. As for who uses it, you decide!"

"Thank you, Hall Master!" Qin Chaoyang said joyfully.

Wen Zishan turned to Yang Kai. "This Lord doesn’t know what connection you have with this old man, but let me remind you—the Four Seasons Realm is dangerous. With the strength of your Origin Qi, you’re an elite, but everyone entering is an elite. Be careful not to stumble inside."

Yang Kai grinned. "I was hoping to meet the elite disciples of the great sects!"

"Young people, so proud!"

"Don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!"

"First Stage Dao Origin Realm, you’ll be at the bottom in there!"

The Emperor Realm experts in the hall all started talking at once.

Wen Zishan smiled. "That spirit is good. Yes, I hope you can keep it up inside. All right, you two may leave. When it’s time to depart, someone will come for you."

He waved his hand, and before Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang could react, they found themselves outside the grand hall.

Standing outside, they glanced at each other. After a moment, a streak of light shot over from afar. Looking closely, it was the Deacon Tao Ming they’d met before!

But now Tao Ming had lost his previous aggressive air. Sweating profusely, he hurried over, cupped his hands to them, and said, "Please, come with me!"

With that, he led the way, and Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang followed closely behind.

In the hall, after sending off Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang, Wen Zishan turned and said, "Little Xueting, do you still have something to say?"

Gao Xueting frowned. "Hall Master, what you’re doing puts me in a difficult position."

Wen Zishan laughed. "It’s just a spot. Squeeze one out."

Gao Xueting snorted. "Fine, I’ll send word that Hall Master wants to take a spot. It’s none of my business!"

"That’s fine!" Wen Zishan nodded. "If anyone objects, tell them to come argue with this Lord!"

His straightforwardness left Gao Xueting momentarily stunned.

Chen Qian said, "Actually, I think we don’t need to give them a spot. When our disciples enter, they can help look for the Calamity Fruit. If that doesn’t work, have Sister Gao wait at the secret realm’s exit and buy from those who come out when it closes. Maybe someone will have found the fruit! After all, Qingyang Shrine isn’t the only one entering. Someone else might get it."

Wen Zishan said, "Little Qian’s idea isn’t bad, but... it’s that person’s request, and this Lord can’t refuse. That’s the end of it. Give them a spot..." He grinned wickedly. "Whether they can keep it depends on their ability. If they can’t, then it’s not worth going. It won’t count as this Lord defying that person’s wishes!"

Hearing this, Gao Xueting’s eyes lit up, and she nodded. "I know what to do."

Wen Zishan nodded slightly, then his figure flickered and vanished.

The others gradually dispersed.

In the end, only Chen Qian and Gao Xueting remained.

"Sister Gao, who are you planning to have make the move?" Chen Qian asked.

Gao Xueting thought for a moment. "What do you think of Xue Yi?"

"Xue Yi?" Chen Qian didn’t seem to remember him well. After thinking, she said, "He’s at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Can that Yang handle him?"

"Among those twenty, Xue Yi’s strength is below average. If that Yang can’t handle even Xue Yi, what’s the point of going in? The Four Seasons Realm isn’t a playground, and the Calamity Fruit isn’t easy to find. I’m doing this for his own good."

"Sister Gao, you have a point!" Chen Qian nodded, though she still felt something was off.

...

Tao Ming brought them to a lone peak a thousand li from the main hall, settled them in a palace atop the summit, and then departed.

Yang Kai checked around and found the peak deserted. In other words, only he and Qin Chaoyang were here.

It was quite peaceful.

After chatting for a while, the two each found a room.

Having traveled in fear, Qin Chaoyang was exhausted and wanted to recover his strength before returning to Fenglin City.

Yang Kai, meanwhile, needed to use this chance to refine the Secret Treasure Aunt Feng had given him, as well as the Imperial Treasure Myriad Sword.

The Myriad Sword was too high-grade to refine thoroughly, so he could only strengthen his connection with it a bit. Fortunately, Yang Kai had the Qin Family’s ancestral refining notes, which would help him avoid some detours.

Time was short. According to Gao Xueting, the Four Seasons Realm would open in a month, and with travel time, Yang Kai figured someone would come for him in half a month at most.

So he raced against the clock.

Five days passed in a flash, and Qin Chaoyang had recovered.

After giving Yang Kai a few final instructions, he took his leave and set out on his journey.

Given the situation, staying any longer was pointless. Since Yang Kai was going into the Four Seasons Realm, Qin Chaoyang might as well head home.

After Yang Kai saw him off, he was left alone in the palace.

One day, while cultivating in his room, Yang Kai suddenly sensed two powerful auras approaching rapidly.

The newcomers made no attempt to hide themselves. One radiated the Third Stage Dao Origin Realm, the other the Second Stage Dao Origin Realm.

"Is it time to set out already?" Yang Kai frowned, muttering to himself. He thought Qingyang Shrine had sent someone to summon him, so he didn’t hesitate, got up, and went outside to wait.
