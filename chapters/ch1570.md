## Chapter 1570 — Anomalous Phenomenon

"Stay where you are!" Magna roared; at the moment Yang Kai stirred, he lashed out a heavy fist, intercepting in the direction Yang Kai had been moving.

A streak of purple light flashed as Yang Kai summoned his Purple Shield, easily blocking the blow, his steps never faltering as he rushed onward with urgent haste.

He had a bad feeling; why would he linger here?

As his figure flickered, ripples of spatial force surged from his body, and in the blink of an eye he was gone without a trace.

Magna and Mi Tian stood frozen on the spot!

They couldn't discern how Yang Kai had just departed — their eyes and Divine Sense had been locked on the human, yet he had slipped free with effortless ease.

The two yao experts' faces grew grave; after exchanging a look, they headed toward the source of the energy.

They were eager to know what had happened over there, and why such strange energy fluctuations were emanating.

In Huiyue City, in front of an inn, a crowd of martial artists had already gathered — drawn by the oddity. Both human and yao stood in the street before the inn, pointing and whispering in small clusters.

When Yang Kai arrived, he glanced up at the sky and showed a helpless, wry smile.

His bad feeling had indeed been confirmed.

The innkeeper stood before his establishment too, stooped and hands tucked into his sleeves; like most, he looked up at the sky with a complex expression, eyes flickering as if discerning something.

Yang Kai spotted him immediately upon arrival; the old man hurriedly waved him over, "Young man, come here."

Yang Kai gave him a look and hurried to his side. Apologetically he said, "Sir, I’m afraid I’m going to trouble you."

The elder chuckled and shook his head, "Old folk's troubles are nothing; your trouble may be great."

Saying so, he cast a faint glance at the arriving Magna, city lord, and Mi Tian, then his mouth twitched slightly as he added, "It seems your trouble isn't limited to the inn."

"Heh…" Yang Kai forced a dry laugh, unsure what to say.

If it were only Magna and Mi Tian targeting him, Yang Kai wouldn’t be the least bit afraid. At worst, he could simply use his space secret arts to take Little Senior Sister and leave. With Yao Star Di Chen being so vast, was there really nowhere for them to hide?

Besides, below the Void King Realm he feared no one. If a fight broke out, Yang Kai could easily turn Huiyue City upside down.

Yet this anomalous phenomenon before him gave him a severe headache.

Upon arriving he immediately realized the anomaly was caused by Little Senior Sister.

Xia Ningshang had been staying in the inn these past days, keeping to herself while refining Spiritual Pills from various ingredients to raise her cultivation.

Yang Kai had not gone to disturb her.

Who would have known that in such a place Little Senior Sister would refine an extraordinary Spiritual Pill.

Yang Kai had experienced this before and could tell: this phenomenon was clearly the omen before a Pill Cloud was born from a Pill!

Back on Rainfall Star, when he refined a fire-attributed Spiritual Pill that developed a Pill Cloud to treat Xue Yue’s wounds caused by Profound Yin Moon Water, the scene had been strikingly similar.

In all his pill refining, only that one pill had produced a Pill Cloud; he knew such a thing was truly rare and could not be summoned at will. Unlike Pill Patterns, which his skill could somewhat influence, Pill Clouds were not to be controlled.

How to make a Pill produce a Pill Cloud was something he had not a clue about.

Little Senior Sister's constitution was special and her talent innate; it was natural she could reach this step.

But this was Yao Star Di Chen, in Huiyue City! Once a Spiritual Pill emerged it would draw countless experts' attention, especially Magna and Mi Tian who had just clashed with Yang Kai — they certainly wouldn't let that pill go.

They might not even spare Xia Ningshang!

A pillsmith capable of producing a Pill Cloud had clearly reached peak artistry and merited the title of Grandmaster! Such a defiant genius would never be left alone by the yao.

Yang Kai's expression flickered as lightning-fast thoughts of advantage and danger crossed his mind.

He could not stop Xia Ningshang now; pill-refinement depended on insight and chance. If Little Senior Sister could take this step, it would greatly aid her growth — stopping her now would destroy that opportunity and might harm her future potential.

He could only let her refine the Spiritual Pill to completion.

It looked like things were about to get very troublesome.

Resolving this in his mind, Yang Kai's eyes grew sharp and cold as a blade.

Magna and Mi Tian stared at the sky; directly above the inn, vast spiritual qi converged as if drawn, visibly forming a small vortex that spun and devoured more surrounding spiritual qi, growing in strength.

"Magna Senior, what is this? Has a wondrous treasure appeared?" Mi Tian, perceptive though inexperienced in witnessing a Pill Cloud's birth, was puzzled and had to ask the older Magna.

Magna frowned, concentrating on the sky as he tried to judge the phenomenon, then slowly shook his head, "Even I cannot tell."

"Even you can't tell?" Mi Tian was surprised.

"The world is vast and full of wonders. It's not strange that even I can't recognize all things. Hmm, any of you able to identify what caused this?" Magna turned to the other Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

They all shook their heads, claiming they'd neither heard nor seen such a thing.

"This is interesting," Mi Tian smiled brightly; his charm enhanced his handsome, slightly devilish face and his white teeth, drawing many admiring glances from the watching women. "It doesn't look like someone's breakthrough or a cultivation secret, and it's not a wondrous treasure either—what could have caused it?"

"Easy to find out, just look inside," shouted an Origin Returning Realm expert near Magna, of the Second Stage, and he shamelessly unleashed his Divine Sense to peer into the inn.

Before his Divine Sense had fully probed into the inn, he suddenly detected a dangerous aura surging toward him; the Divine Sense he had extended returned a burning heat as if seared by raging flames.

A scream rang out as the yao expert staggered back, clutching his head in splitting pain, face drained of color!

In an instant every martial artist's gaze focused on Yang Kai.

They sensed it had been Yang Kai's Divine Sense that had repelled the intruder and injured him.

Magna's expression was as dark as still water, while Mi Tian’s smile carried a hint of mockery.

"This is only a warning. Whoever dares pry again, don't blame me for being merciless." Yang Kai stood alone before them, his voice cold and cutting.

It was the critical moment of Little Senior Sister's pill refinement; even he dared not disturb her — much less would he let these yao use their Divine Sense to spy. What if they interfered with Xia Ningshang's refining?

Though both sides shared the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, in the contest of Divine Sense the yao proved weak, making Magna and Mi Tian all the more solemn toward Yang Kai.

"Boy!" Magna's deep voice thundered, "Are you determined to make an enemy of my yao?"

"Bold indeed, if a bit overconfident," Mi Tian laughed lightly, taunting.

Yang Kai remained silent, staring coldly at them. No one doubted his resolve; those yao cultivators who had been itching to probe with their Divine Sense now backed down, their eyes betraying fear.

Though not as massive as yao, the human stood there and made every yao feel like they faced a sturdy, towering mountain shielding the inn from all storms.

Strangely, some yao felt a flicker of admiration for Yang Kai while fearing him.

Not every human possessed such courage—to stand alone, unfazed, under the watchful, predatory gazes of so many powerful yao experts.

"Enough! You've disdained me and my yao repeatedly; you even snubbed Young Master Mi Tian. Today this place will be your burial; prepare yourself!" Magna lost patience, already resentful toward Yang Kai; with Yang Kai's defiant stance he would not yield.

He intended to kill the human first; the inn's hidden mysteries could be investigated later.

"You're done for!" Mi Tian grinned maliciously at Yang Kai, murderous intent in his eyes.

Though he feigned carefreeness, Yang Kai had slain the two Ninth-Tier demonic beasts pulling his carriage — how could Mi Tian tolerate that? Now he would join with Magna against him.

All Origin Returning Realm cultivators silently stirred their energies, ready to strike Yang Kai.

"If you want my life, see if you have the skill to take it!" Yang Kai snorted, and an invisible force erupted from him, roaring outward. Those enveloped by it felt as if sinking into a mire — Saint Yuan faltered and their channels were blocked.

Shi!

At the display of his Shi, Magna's face changed dramatically.

He was shocked to find that even he, in terms of Shi, was somewhat inferior to this human youth.

How could that be?

He was at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm while the other was only Second Stage; though only a single Stage apart, that gap should mark a gulf. Why was the human's Shi stronger than his?

The yao had all manifested their own Shi to counter Yang Kai, yet still could not dispel the invisible force's effect upon them.

Moreover, each yao sensed something special mixed into the human youth's Shi — a power that chilled them to the bone and left them mute, as if any movement would mean instant death.
