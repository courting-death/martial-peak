## Chapter 1421 — Imperial Jade

"Why the long faces?" Yang Kai watched their expressions and, knowing what Chang Qi and the others were worried about, grinned and said, "It's only a Dragon Lair Mountain; if it's gone, it's gone. No need to brood over it."

"But it's our home." Wu Yi sighed deeply.

"There's a saying: when the old leaves, the new comes!" Yang Kai smiled at her. "Even if Dragon Lair Mountain is gone, we still have other places to land, and those places are a thousandfold better than Dragon Lair Mountain."

Wu Yi and the others looked at Yang Kai with suspicion, utterly unconvinced.

Although Dragon Lair Mountain had originally been only a small hill, with sparse Spiritual Qi and not suited for residence or cultivation, over these years—through everyone's careful work—it had become a renowned place for cultivation; many unaligned warriors had longed to join Dragon Lair Mountain and find a place to train.

Only Dragon Lair Mountain never admitted outsiders, always politely turning them away; otherwise it would not have remained so small—by now it would have become a minor sect of a thousand people.

Now that Yang Kai claimed there was a new place to settle that was a thousand times better than Dragon Lair Mountain, no wonder Wu Yi and the others didn't believe him.

"Even Yingyue Hall's main headquarters couldn't be a thousand times better than Dragon Lair Mountain, right?" Wu Yi pouted, instinctively thinking Yang Kai was only comforting them.

"And what if that place is even better than Yingyue Hall's main headquarters?" Yang Kai said with a smile, looking at her.

"How could that be? If there really were such a place, why wouldn't other forces occupy it? Anywhere on Dark Star where Spiritual Qi is dense is already taken by sects or other powers. How could it possibly be our turn?" Chang Qi also found it hard to believe.

“Mm, Elder Chang is right. But that place isn’t something one can simply claim at will. Aside from us, I doubt anyone else could even set foot there,” Yang Kai said with a mysterious expression. “In fact, even if this battle hadn’t happened, Yang Yan and I had already planned to relocate everyone there before long. This incident just serves as the perfect opportunity, so there’s no need for you to worry too much about Dragon Lair Mountain.”

"Sister Yang Yan, is what he says true?" Wu Yi turned in astonishment to Yang Yan.

Yang Yan nodded slightly, confirming Yang Kai's words, and when she nodded all present revealed expressions of disbelief.

"Then what exactly is this place? If its environment is so superior, why hasn't any force seized it?" Wu Yi grew even more puzzled.

"Like I said — even if others wanted to seize it, they lack the ability." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Because that place lies within the Flowing Flame Sandland!"

"Inside the Flowing Flame Sandland?" Wu Yi and the others exclaimed in unison.

The woman surnamed Ye, however, wore a look of sudden thought and asked in surprise, "The Taixuan Sect ruins?"

"Oh? You actually know that?" Yang Kai was a little surprised; he had learned that it was the Taixuan Sect ruins from Yang Yan, so it was odd that the woman surnamed Ye also knew.

"Of course I know; I merely read it in the records. After all, that place was a sect supported by the Lord—by the Great Emperor—long ago." A flicker of strange color passed through the woman's beautiful eyes as she glanced at Yang Yan with deliberate casualness.

"I see." Yang Kai nodded slightly, not asking further about the woman's relation to Yang Yan. But the other clearly knew Yang Yan's identity; otherwise, given the woman's cultivation, she would not have acted so deferentially.

It seemed this woman surnamed Ye truly knew some hidden affairs.

For now it wasn't convenient to probe; he would ask Yang Yan later when there was a chance.

Chang Qi and the others, having heard the dialogue between the woman surnamed Ye and Yang Kai, all wore astonished expressions—none had expected there to be a sect ruin within the Flowing Flame Sandland, and each looked shocked.

"You'll see what that place is like when we arrive. For now, don't dwell on it—go maintain the warship's operations. I've already set the course; just keep the current speed." Yang Yan instructed calmly.

Chang Qi and the others responded and withdrew.

Soon the hall held only Yang Kai, Yang Yan, the woman surnamed Ye and Ge Qi.

Yang Yan cast the woman a look; the other understood and waved to Ge Qi, "Young Qi, you may descend as well."

"Yes, Grandmaster!" Ge Qi bowed slightly and took his leave.

Once only the three remained, Yang Yan hurriedly reached out to Yang Kai and said, "Bring me what you just obtained so I can see it."

Yang Kai was momentarily startled, then reached into his Spatial Ring and took out a palm-sized jade tablet, tossing it to Yang Yan. She received it, scrutinized it, and said softly, "Indeed, it's Imperial Jade!"

"Imperial Jade?" Yang Kai frowned. "What use does this thing have?"

"It resists Imperial Might and serves as the pass to enter the Imperial Garden. Without it, no one may enter the Imperial Garden." Yang Yan explained quickly. "When the Imperial Garden opens, only those holding Imperial Jade may safely enter its interior."

"Oh? Then won't many Imperial Jades appear?" Yang Kai immediately caught the crucial point.

If the Imperial Garden opens, it cannot be that only one person may enter; since Imperial Jade is the entry pass, many Imperial Jades will appear in the world.

"Exactly. This first Imperial Jade fell at Dragon Lair Mountain—perhaps because I was there—and soon more Imperial Jades will appear." Yang Yan furrowed her brow, as if pondering.

After a moment she suddenly looked up; she and Yang Kai exchanged a glance and understood each other's thought.

Seize the Imperial Jades!

No matter what, they had to snatch some Imperial Jades back; otherwise, when the Imperial Garden opened there would not be enough passes to let both her and Yang Kai enter together.

Besides, now that a woman surnamed Ye had appeared in Dragon Lair Mountain, she would surely try to enter the Imperial Garden if possible; in other words, they needed at least three Imperial Jades to feel secure.

Just then, a low humming sound suddenly arose from outside, followed by the sharp whooshing of something tearing through the air.

Yang Kai immediately sent out Divine Sense to probe; once he confirmed, his expression sank: "Imperial Jade has indeed appeared in the world."

Atop Dragon Lair Mountain the Imperial Garden suddenly shot forth dozens to hundreds of streaks of light—pure, flawless radiance—darting outward in all directions at incredible speed and, in the blink of an eye, streaking to the horizon.

The many experts who had just withdrawn from Dragon Lair Mountain were drawn by the strange sight and, moment later, without hesitation, unleashed their Star Shuttles and, like meteors chasing the moon, pursued the different white lights.

No one knew these were Imperial Jades, but since they spewed from the Imperial Garden, none wished to let them pass by.

Some lucky warriors merely stood in place and had an Imperial Jade fall not far from them; elated, they rushed to snatch it up, only to be confronted by stronger fighters who, without a word, launched into battle.

Others tracked desperately but soon lost the trail of the Imperial Jades; their speed was simply too great.

Some employed secret arts and doggedly followed the Imperial Jades, determined to seize them.

In an instant Dark Star descended into chaos as major powers' experts all mobilized for the Imperial Jades, and the scene became utterly chaotic.

Upon sensing the appearance of Imperial Jade, Yang Kai immediately left the warship with Yang Yan and the woman surnamed Ye; barely had they landed when Yang Kai cried out in delight, staring at a certain point in the sky where a white light was racing directly toward them.

Luck indeed!

Not only Yang Kai looked pleased; the woman surnamed Ye also beamed, and with a wave an ancient lamp floated above her head, its flame an eerie blue that radiated a chilling cold and flickered uncertainly.

A Void King-Grade Secret Treasure—the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp! A famed existence across Dark Star.

In a flash the white light from the Imperial Garden drew to within only a hundred zhang of the three of them; as it neared, the woman reached out with an elegant movement, pinched a bloom from the lamp's flame, flicked it outward, and the tiny flame expanded into a pale-blue barrier that stood in the Imperial Jade's path.

The light had just formed when the Imperial Jade slammed into it; silently, that seemingly impenetrable blue barrier was rent with a hole.

The woman's face changed; she flicked the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp and sent forth surges of force. The lamp's flame swayed and spat out successive blue lights that faced the Imperial Jade, forming one blue barrier after another.

A hissing chorus rose as the Imperial Jade's pure white radiance struck with terrifying might; the woman's defenses were shattered as if by a battering ram.

Her face truly changed now.

Before she could act further, Yang Kai moved. The Artifact Spirit Fire Bird gave a sharp cry, beat its wings, and flew to intercept.

But the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird could not stop the Imperial Jade; the moment it contacted the jade it dissolved.

Fortunately, after those attempts the Imperial Jade's speed dropped significantly.

A strange light flashed in Yang Yan's beautiful eyes; with a light flick of her hand the crimson ring on her wrist became a circle of fire and enveloped the Imperial Jade.

The Three Flames Ring!

This Secret Treasure belonged to the Starry Sky Emperor, its grade beyond ordinary reckoning; the Flowing Flame Sandland itself had become a forbidden domain of Dark Star due to the Three Flames Ring's perennial aura.

Although Yang Yan had only taken one of its flames and could not unleash the treasure's full power, as an imperial relic it was still not to be underestimated.

The Imperial Jade, which had penetrated both the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, seemed to meet its nemesis upon touching the fire ring; it froze midair and was soon entirely encircled by the fire loop.

A buzzing sound arose as the Imperial Jade struggled against the Three Flames Ring, but once trapped it was not so easy to escape.

Yang Yan unleashed waves of Saint Yuan and the Three Flames Ring bound the Imperial Jade like an iron hoop, completely imprisoning it.
