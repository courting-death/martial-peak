## Chapter 1445 — Hidden Cavern

Since the Imperial Garden was opened to the entire Star Domain, as long as Su Yan remained somewhere within the Star Domain she would have a chance to enter it — yet Yang Kai had no idea what her cultivation now was, whether she even qualified to enter, and even if she did, whether she could successfully obtain an Imperial Jade!

So many uncertainties made the odds of the two of them meeting here vanishingly small; even so, Yang Kai still harbored a faint hope in his heart.

The two of them were bound by the Dual Cultivation Technique, woven together inextricably; if Su Yan truly was in this area, her presence could be sensed within a certain range and she would not be difficult to find.

Thoughts swirling, Yang Kai brushed his hand over his ring and a crystal-clear pearl exuding a cold aura appeared in his palm.

Su Yan’s Ice Soul Pearl! While the pearl lived the person lived; if the pearl broke, the person perished!

This Ice Soul Pearl had been given to him by Qian Yue. Even after so many years since it was refined, it still carried traces of a familiar aura that stirred nostalgia in Yang Kai’s heart. Feeling the coolness radiating from the pearl in his palm, his gaze softened, and his restless thoughts gradually calmed.

Stowing the pearl safely back into his Spatial Ring, Yang Kai let out a long howl—like a rolling dragon’s roar echoing through the heavens. Releasing the last trace of stifled frustration in his chest, his figure shot forth like lightning, speeding toward the location of the Imperial Garden.

One day later, Yang Kai still skimmed across the prairie; the scenery around him had not changed much, a testament to how vast and strange this place was.

Along the way he did not encounter any great danger. Although quite a number of martial artists had entered the Imperial Garden, they were dispersed over such an enormous area that the crowds were not dense.

The prairie, however, was home to a number of unusual demonic beasts; each one looked hard to deal with — either brimming with yao qi and exceptional in strength, or adept at fleeing. They gave no one an opportunity to approach.

Yang Kai had no intention of wasting time dealing with those demonic beasts; he only wanted to find someone to reconnoiter and confirm whether his direction was correct.

While flying he let his Divine Sense spread out lazily in all directions.

After the time it takes for one incense stick to burn, his figure suddenly halted and a trace of delight flashed across his face. Not far to his left there was clearly the presence of living people, and in some number.

Perfect for a probe, Yang Kai decided, and turned his course to speed toward them.

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Yang Kai arrived at their location. Taking it in at a glance, his expression unconsciously shifted to one of mild surprise, his eyes fixing on a particular spot with keen interest.

There was no other reason: he had actually discovered traces of restrictive formations and arrays here.

At the spot his gaze fell upon, an energy curtain shimmered faintly — apparently it had been struck and sustained some damage. When the energy curtain flickered, the scene wrapped within it also changed subtly.

An illusionary array!

Yang Kai’s brow lifted as he scrutinized it all the more carefully.

The terrain here was rather unusual. Though it was still a grassland, a circular mountain range stood in the midst of it. At first glance, the valley enclosed within showed nothing out of the ordinary—lush with greenery, yet devoid of any Spiritual Herbs or rare medicines.

But all of that had to be a falsehood. When the energy curtain flickered, the scenery inside the valley shifted.

Could it be? Was his luck really this good?

Yang Kai clicked his tongue in wonder. Only a day before he had heard Min Sha mention that there were many hidden caverns on this prairie; he had not expected to meet one so soon.

That valley was plainly a hidden cavern — there was no doubt about it. Otherwise, there would have been no need to lay an illusionary array around the perimeter. The array was meant to confuse onlookers, yet it had been discovered and then attacked, which was why it had been exposed.

At this moment two parties were gathered here, both small in number: one group of four and another of three. Each side was led by a martial artist of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; the rest were only First or Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

The side closest to the valley’s formation had fewer people — all women.

Yang Kai’s gaze swept past the three women and he could not help but raise his brow, a contemplative expression shading his features. The three all wore pristine white court robes and seemed to be from the same sect, their looks extraordinary. Even the eldest was full of allure, and the other two were slim and curvaceous in their own ways.

What interested Yang Kai, however, was not their beauty but their bearing.

Cold, aloof, as if not to be trifled with; they seemed to keep others at a thousand-mile distance, and the aura emanating from their delicate bodies was icy to the extreme.

This bearing gave Yang Kai a strange sense of familiarity and fondness — the same aura that clung to Su Yan.

On the other side stood cultivators from what appeared to be the same sect, clad in garments of blazing red like burning spheres of fire. Three men and one woman all looked upon the opposite three with ill intent.

Though he had only just arrived and glanced briefly, Yang Kai quickly understood the situation.

The three women had clearly found the hidden cavern first; when they attacked the restrictive formation they were discovered and pursued by the other party.

Because the disparity in numbers and strength between the sides was not overwhelming, they were at a stalemate — neither side appeared willing to strike first. Martial artists faced with such scenarios usually resolved them in one of two ways.

One option was for both sides to fight to the death, with the survivors taking all the spoils.

The other was to reach a temporary agreement to explore together and divide the gains according to prior negotiation.

There was no other possibility.

Yang Kai read the situation and considered the first option more likely. When the two sides looked at each other their eyes glinted with hatred and fury, as if they already knew each other and the enmity ran deep.

He could not tell which star they hailed from.

This was interesting! Yang Kai’s heart brightened. If the two parties truly joined forces, he would certainly have nothing to do with the matter. To fight seven opponents alone — and two of them being Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — was beyond his arrogance. It would be unreasonable to battle over a hidden cavern of uncertain value.

Yet if the reward were sufficiently clear, Yang Kai would not mind stretching his limbs to try and snatch something from the fire.

Although the three women felt familiar to him, they were strangers in every sense. Yang Kai had no intention of nobly stepping in; he only hoped they would start fighting sooner rather than later.

To his disappointment, neither side made a move. Instead, his arrival caused the already delicate situation to take a new turn.

When Yang Kai reached the place, the seven naturally noticed him. But upon realizing he was only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, they all breathed easier, and the red-clad party even revealed expressions of disdain.

The leader was a bald hulking man, brutish in appearance. He coldly sized Yang Kai up, and upon seeing Yang Kai show no intention of leaving but instead linger, his face turned cold and he barked, “Kid, this isn’t your business. If you don’t want to die, get out of here.”

Yang Kai’s lip twitched and he displayed no fear — his demeanor only grew calmer.

The leader on the opposing side, the woman dressed like a married lady, arched her brows and a hint of pleasure flashed in her deep eyes.

She had only three people on her side. Though their individual strength was not much weaker than the opposing group’s, they were still outnumbered. Seeing the bald brute threaten Yang Kai so mercilessly, her eyes flickered—an idea forming. She began to consider drawing Yang Kai to her side.

If Yang Kai joined her side, the numerical gap would instantly be closed and she would no longer have cause for concern.

Although First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm was not high, it was still an Origin Returning Realm — at such a crucial time even that would be useful.

With that thought the married-looking woman stopped hesitating and scoffed at the bald man, “Kong Wendong, such big talk. With me here, do you think you have the power to harm the innocent?”

After saying this she nodded lightly to Yang Kai and said warmly, “Young brother, don’t be afraid. As long as I am alive, he cannot do anything to you.”

“Heh…” Yang Kai let out an awkward chuckle, utterly speechless.

The woman’s attempt to charm and recruit him could not be more obvious. With his wits, Yang Kai knew precisely what she meant — clearly she sought to use his strength; otherwise she wouldn’t be sheltering an unrelated outsider so protectively.

From their exchanges it was clear the two parties knew each other and bore long-standing grudges.

“Wretch!” the bald man sneered. “You have that kind of ability? You talk big about Kong, but your talk is no small thing either!”

As he spoke, he turned his head toward Yang Kai and snarled fiercely, “Brat, this is my last warning—leave now if you don’t want to die! Don’t think that wretched woman can really protect you. If you get dragged into the feud between my Fire Radiance Sect and her Ice Heart Valley, your only end will be utter annihilation!”

Fire Radiance Sect, Ice Heart Valley… Yang Kai arched a brow. He had not heard of these two forces before, but their names suggested they clashed like fire and water — no wonder the two sides were at each other’s throats.

He did not put Kong Wendong’s threat in his heart. With his current strength, only a Void King Realm expert could kill him in an instant; an Origin Returning Realm cultivator did not possess that power.

The young woman smiled faintly, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear as she said casually, “Kong Wendong, you really are growing more and more senile—reduced to barking threats now, are you? Young brother, there’s no need to fear him. Though the Fire Radiance Sect is no weakling, my Ice Heart Valley isn’t so easily bullied either. If you’re willing to lend us a hand, I can offer you some benefits in return. What do you say?”

Hearing this, Kong Wendong frowned, while Yang Kai’s interest was piqued. With a look of one who would risk life for gain, he asked cheerfully, “What sort of benefits?”

The woman’s smile was like a blossom. She parted her lips and said, “Pills, Saint Crystals — how about that?”

Yang Kai scoffed and slowly shook his head.

Pills and Saint Crystals might hold considerable appeal for other First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators, but they held no temptation for him.
