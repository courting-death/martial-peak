## Chapter 445 — Alchemist Turmoil

Perhaps because she was the Senior Sister, Han Xiao Qi’s bearing was cold and aloof, while Ye Han was innocent and adorable. Liu Qingru was enchanting and graceful, and Hua Ruoyin was serene and obedient.

Staring blankly at Han Xiao Qi, Yang Kai seemed to discover a trace of Su Yan in her. His sharp eyes unconsciously softened.

Both were Senior Sisters within their respective Sects and shared some similarities, though Su Yan was undoubtedly colder than Han Xiao Qi. That coldness was shown only to outsiders; in front of Yang Kai, her chill would melt like the early spring snow.

Han Xiao Qi’s neck flushed red, unable to bear Yang Kai’s burning gaze. She glared sharply at him and said in a low voice, “I’m telling the truth, why are you staring at me like that?”

Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but snort lightly, biting her teeth in secret, thinking that men were truly all scoundrels when they saw a beauty.

The tender emotions in Yang Kai’s eyes and the deep affection on his face—anyone who wasn’t blind could see clearly. None of those present were children; how could they not understand?

“Yang Kai, you don’t have to be so blatant,” Zuo Fang chuckled awkwardly. “Though Senior Sister Han is beautiful and we all want to sneak a glance, we do it quietly. Why are you making it so obvious?”

Han Xiao Qi, already uncomfortable from Yang Kai’s stare, blushed and shot a glare at Zuo Fang. “You’re no better. You’re just as bad as him!”

Zuo Fang smiled sheepishly.

Yang Kai said nothing, offering no explanation. The peculiar expression in his eyes slowly faded, replaced by calmness as he turned his head to look outside the hall.

Thump, thump, thump—urgent footsteps approached.

Fatty Dong’s face showed a trace of anxiety. Entering without greeting anyone, he hurriedly said, “Yang Kai, something’s happened. You need to take people and go check it out.”

“What’s the matter?” Yang Kai frowned.

Everyone’s faces grew serious. Sudden incidents often happened in the succession war. Since they had come to support Yang Kai, they were naturally prepared for battle at all times.

“Qingyan and her group have arrived at War City, but they’ve been stopped inside the city!”

“They’re here?” Yang Kai’s expression flickered, a hint of joy flashing across his face. Without delay, he strode toward the door, calling urgently, “Ying Jiu, come with me!”

Without Blood Servants protecting them, appearing openly in broad daylight was very risky.

“No, no,” Fatty Dong said, sweat on his brow; evidently, the news had startled him as well. “With the support you have now, at least half of them need to be mobilized. You don’t really know the situation over there.”

Yang Kai glanced at him in surprise but didn’t question further. He nodded and said, “Then have people from the Huo Family, Xiang Family, Dong Family, and Duanmu Family come with me. Qiu Yimeng, you stay behind.”

“Understood,” the young lady Qiu Yimeng replied firmly.

“What about us?” Han Xiao Qi asked.

“You all stay here and rest. This shouldn’t be a big deal.”

With that, Yang Kai and Dong Qinghan quickly headed outside. As they rushed, Dong Qinghan whistled sharply. At once, the manor was filled with the rustling of flowing robes.

By the time Yang Kai reached the entrance, Huo Xingchen and Xiang Tianxiao were already waiting with a group outside. Among them stood five Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Duanmu Family, who had silently stood aside the night they had last met Yang Kai. Upon seeing him, they gave a slight nod: “Greetings, Young Master Kai!”

“Thank you for your efforts,” Yang Kai said, nodding to the five Duanmu Family warriors.

“Yang Kai, what’s happening?” Huo Xingchen asked curiously. This was the first time Yang Kai had actively gathered forces to attack, naturally piquing his interest.

“We’ll talk on the way. I don’t know much either,” Yang Kai answered casually.

The group set off in a grand formation.

“How did Qingyan get stopped?” Yang Kai finally had a moment to inquire. Though she was Xiao Fusheng’s disciple, she had only started learning alchemy recently. That she could now produce Earth-Grade Pills was already impressive. Moreover, considering Xiao Fusheng’s method of cultivating disciples, Dong Qingyan probably hadn’t truly begun refining pills.

Such an alchemist hardly seemed worthy of being stopped.

Dong Qinghan let out a bitter laugh. “If it were just Qingyan alone, it wouldn’t be a problem. Do you know how many people she brought?”

“Thirty!” Dong Qinghan said gravely. “Thirty alchemists from Yao Wang Valley. Half of them are Heaven-Grade alchemists, and one is even a Mystery-Grade.”

“What?” Yang Kai’s face registered astonishment. Even the usually carefree Huo Xingchen gaped.

“Why would people from Yao Wang Valley join the succession war?” Young Master Huo almost thought he misheard, incredulous.

Dong Qinghan shook his head. “I don’t know the details. You should ask Yang Kai. They have come to join him this time.”

Glancing meaningfully at Yang Kai, Dong Qinghan’s mind was clearly filled with speculation.

Huo Xingchen was shocked. “Yang Kai, where did you get such influence to mobilize that blockhead group from Yao Wang Valley? Those people are full of pride and wouldn’t even be looked at by me. How are you so powerful?”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, ignoring Huo Xingchen. His heart filled with anxiety.

Dong Qingyan came—so the Little Junior Sister must have come too!

Stopped in War City by his brothers, if something happened to the Little Junior Sister because of this...

His gaze grew icy; his True Yuan surged wildly.

Those following Yang Kai—Dong Qinghan and Huo Xingchen—both shuddered, turning their heads in alarm. Yang Kai’s aura had suddenly transformed, becoming fierce and violent, faintly tinged with the scent of blood. This murderous Qi made their skin crawl, prompting them to keep some distance.

After advancing a short distance, Yang Kai suddenly halted. His eyes flickered as he turned toward Xiang Tianxiao. “Second Young Master Xiang, you’re not coming any further.”

Xiang Tianxiao said nothing, simply watching Yang Kai as he continued.

Yang Kai beckoned and whispered several words in Xiang Tianxiao’s ear. The second young master nodded slightly.

Yang Kai then looked at the five Duanmu Family Divine Roaming Realm experts. Bowing, he said, “Sirs, please follow the Second Young Master. Qiu Yimeng has arranged the specifics.”

The five nodded in unison.

Xiang Tianxiao then led his forces and the five from Duanmu Family back.

“What are you doing?” Huo Xingchen asked, puzzled.

Yang Kai frowned. “I didn’t know the situation earlier. Now that I do, I have to make some preparations. Otherwise, that group might not return.”

“Would they dare attack Yao Wang Valley’s people?” Huo Xingchen’s eyes widened.

“In extraordinary times, extraordinary measures.” Yang Kai took a deep breath and said steadily, “If it were me, I’d rather offend Yao Wang Valley than allow such a large force to aid my enemies. Besides, they wouldn’t kill anyone—only try to capture Yao Wang Valley’s people.”

Hearing this, Dong Qinghan and Huo Xingchen both nodded slightly. No one getting killed meant they wouldn’t greatly offend Yao Wang Valley. They could prepare some gifts later to apologize.

At the central part of War City—

A group from Yao Wang Valley wearing white robes stopped. Dong Qingyan and Xia Ningshang stood side by side, with Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan, two beautiful women, nearby.

They were surrounded from all sides by several groups, and as time passed, more Yang Family disciples arrived with a large number of experts.

Despite being surrounded, the Yao Wang Valley group remained arrogant, each looking down with disdain and supreme confidence. Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan maintained calm expressions.

Only Dong Qingyan bit her teeth, furious. Xia Ningshang’s gentle eyes were filled with worry and urgency as she glanced repeatedly toward the northwest.

That direction was said to be where the Junior Brother’s manor was.

The groups surrounding Yao Wang Valley showed no disrespect. Instead, they all wore friendly, warm smiles, bowing respectfully from afar.

Yang Zhao, Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying stood on four sides.

Except for Yang Kang looking glum, the other three eyed each other cautiously, wearing vigilant expressions.

Yang Kang was indeed miserable. When the Yao Wang Valley group entered War City, they passed within a thousand zhang of his manor. By the time he heard the news of thirty white-robed alchemists suddenly appearing in the city, it was already too late to act.

Though they had successfully stopped the group, the news spread swiftly, causing Yang Zhao, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying to bring people to the scene.

Currently, all the great young masters’ manors were urgently recruiting alchemists and refining masters. Such a group appearing in War City naturally attracted attention.

What annoyed Yang Kang most was that this group was from Yao Wang Valley—not ordinary alchemists from common Sects.

The leader was none other than Qin Ze, the young valley lord of Yao Wang Valley!

Though Qin Ze was already in his forties, his father was still alive, so he still held the title and respect of Young Valley Lord.

Qin Ze was famous in the alchemy world, possessing remarkable talent. Given time, he might reach the heights of Xiao Fusheng.

Rumor had it that Qin Ze had recently passed the elders’ trial in Yao Wang Valley and advanced to Lower-Level Mystery-Grade alchemist status. Now, it seemed true.

The four-petal flower embroidered on his chest was the surest symbol.

Looking at the others, half were Heaven-Grade alchemists, and the rest Earth-Grade, all Upper-Level.

The petals on their robes dazzled the Yang Family disciples, stirring envy.

Such a group, if brought into their camp, could produce countless pills and empower many people.

The four silently calculated, shocked to find that with proper materials, these alchemists could upgrade the strength of everyone under their control by an entire tier in less than three months.

In other words, having them meant a major advantage in the succession war’s future.

Everyone’s eyes reddened, their breath growing hot.

These thirty-plus alchemists tempted them as much as thirty beauties naked and longing for affection.

Only their arrogant demeanors remained somewhat off-putting.
