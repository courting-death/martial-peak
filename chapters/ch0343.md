## Chapter 343 — Refining the Original Source

Looking at Yang Kai wandering leisurely, effortlessly gathering the Evil Spirit Origin, Yu Qing could only manage a bitter smile, opening his mouth to say something, but dared not utter a word.

The old man also had a grim expression, feeling a strong urge to spit blood.

After a long while, Yang Kai finally finished collecting the Evil Spirit Origin around them. He glanced over lightly and chuckled, “Continue, I’ll come back to collect more later!”

These words were indeed a bit infuriating, bordering on courting death.

The four Purifying Spirit Flasks were not yet full. Yang Kai wandered off a distance before returning.

Arriving at the high platform where everyone was resting, he tossed the four Purifying Spirit Flasks to the Sisters from the Hu Family and said, “Keep an eye on these; I need to digest for a bit.”

“Understood,” replied the Sisters from the Hu Family, their faces blooming with sweet smiles like peach blossoms.

Although these final four Purifying Spirit Flasks were given entirely to Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er, none from the Ghost King Valley or Baoqi Sect had any complaints.

Each sect had already harvested two flasks of Evil Spirit Origin.

Yang Kai had not only paid back his debt to the Ghost King Valley but had also given them a significant haul.

There was no need to mention Tao Yang and the others from Baoqi Sect; they had come here simply because their master wanted the Evil Spirit Origin to see if it could be used for refining weapons.

Initially intending to deal with a few Red Evil Spirits, they had now reaped a huge reward; it was hard to be unhappy about that.

Moreover, when Hu Mei’er had desperately attempted to jump into the Corrupted Fountain Water to find Yang Kai, it made everyone realize that the relationship between Yang Kai and these twins seemed rather complicated, not merely as they had thought — a fleeting encounter.

No wonder when Yang Kai had taken action earlier, he had managed to bring the twins over from that high platform.

Thinking of this, everyone looked at Yang Kai and then at the Sisters from the Hu Family, their expressions shifting with a certain ambiguity.

“He’s truly a rogue!” Leng Shan thought bitterly, suppressing her resentment.

Initially, in the foreign land, this rascal had taken advantage of both her and Zi Mo. If it hadn’t been for the sudden arrival of an enemy at the crucial moment, it wouldn’t be surprising if he had already ended up with Zi Mo.

At that time, if Zi Mo had truly been taken by him, Leng Shan felt she would have had no way to escape his grasp.

Who would have thought that in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, he would still encounter beauties with ambiguous relationships, and even worse, a pair of twins!

Just how many women did he know outside to encounter such a low-probability event?

With this thought, Leng Shan felt increasingly uncomfortable and secretly resolved never to associate with Yang Kai again. Although he was indeed a decent person, he was too much of a flirt.

Staying with him could lead to losing her purity without knowing how it happened.

She still hoped to marry into a good family. Glancing at the Sisters from the Hu Family, Leng Shan’s lips moved.

No sound came out, but her mouth formed the words “infatuated fool”.

The atmosphere on the high platform was one of happiness and cheer. Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the ground, retreating all the evil energy back into his Proud Bone Golden Body, while the True Yang Yuan Qi in his Dantian began to fill his meridians anew.

The evil energies contained within the Corrupted Fountain Water could be directly devoured into the Unyielding Will Golden Body, but the Evil Spirit Origin could not; it needed to be tempered with True Yang Yuan Qi.

After checking the origins within his Dantian, he found a hundred groups or more, with only one certainly being a special origin.

It was the lump left behind by the Soul Evil Spirit after its death.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai decided to leave it for last.

Good things should always be saved for last.

Guiding the other origins from his Dantian into his meridians, Yang Kai tempered them using his True Yuan while contemplating the shackles of his Martial Arts.

The vague shackles of heaven and earth pressed upon him; this layer of restraint, which was imperceptible until reaching a certain extent, could be distinctly felt when a martial artist was on the verge of a breakthrough.

Breaking this layer of restriction would allow a martial artist's strength to ascend to a new level, but if unable to do so, their cultivation would stagnate. The stronger the martial artist, the more difficult it became to break these restraints.

This is also why martial artists experience slower growth in strength during the later stages.

Sometimes a martial artist might linger for years at one realm, precisely because they are limited by their aptitude, unable to break through that threshold.

Such constraints are especially obvious at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Thus, there are very few people who can break through to transcend the Divine Roaming Realm in the world today. Each martial artist who does so is a dominant force; at the very least, they are the leaders of a first-rate power.

If there was an exception, it would only be Ling Taixu, given that Lingxiao Pavilion was merely a second-rate sect and was currently on the brink of annihilation.

Yang Kai focused his mind and gathered his essence, continuously impacting the restraints binding him.

Time slowly passed.

Unbeknownst to how long it had been, that layer of restraint was suddenly broken through, and an inexplicable lightness filled his entire body as if he had escaped from a cage, bringing an overwhelming sense of freedom to his mind and body.

It seemed that nothing in this world could hinder his steps toward the pinnacle of Martial Arts.

An invisible aura expanded outward with Yang Kai at its center, rippling outwards in visible waves.

The group, who had been chatting happily, was startled by this sudden disturbance and quickly turned to look at Yang Kai.

After confirming that the commotion was due to Yang Kai’s breakthrough, everyone displayed strange expressions.

Daring to break through in such a dangerous environment, Yang Kai’s courage was indeed commendable!

True Yuan Realm, Sixth Stage!

Even after successfully breaking through, Yang Kai did not immediately rise but continued to operate his Cultivation Method, integrating the Evil Spirit Origin he had just tempered into his Unyielding Will Golden Body.

The Golden Body was no longer saturated; it generated a vortex-like suction, swallowing the purified origin energy.

The newly achieved realm quickly stabilized.

In his Dantian, there remained a lump of origin.

It was that special origin left behind after the Soul Evil Spirit’s death.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted, and his spirit lifted. He was looking forward to what benefits this special origin would bring him.

True Yuan guided it through his meridians, refining and burning.

Impurities were gradually expelled, transformed into useless materials ejected from his body.

As expected of a special origin, Yang Kai spent a full hour to barely complete its refinement.

Once refined, the origin flowed through his meridians, bringing an odd sensation that felt refreshing to the mind and body — an effect unmatched by any other origin.

Suddenly, it surged along the meridians straight toward the top of his head, disappearing in an instant.

In the next moment, Yang Kai sensed a significant increase in the strength of his Divine Sense.

This was indeed a lump of Evil Spirit Origin capable of enhancing Divine Sense!

Moreover, it seemed to bring something else along with it.

Yang Kai’s eyes snapped open, and bolts of electricity seemed to flash across his pupils as they shone brilliantly. He fell into a daze for a moment before an odd smile crept onto his face.

Slowly rising, Yang Kai gazed toward the high platform where the old man stood.

“Brother Yang, are you alright?” Shen Yi asked anxiously.

“En, I’m better than ever,” Yang Kai nodded slightly, his gaze toward the old man gradually becoming dangerous.

Seemingly aware of Yang Kai’s gaze, the old man turned back to look. Just one glance, and the old man frowned.

He realized that this strange young man seemed somewhat different from before; compared to moments ago, he seemed more confident, more arrogant, and more overbearing.

Just having progressed a small realm, did he think he could target the old man? The old man internally sneered, finding it truly ridiculous.

Yang Kai was indeed targeting him.

The old man had just assaulted Yang Kai for that special Evil Spirit Origin. If not for Yang Kai’s excellent physique and the pureness of his True Yuan, he might not have been able to erect a Yang Liquid Shield in a critical moment; otherwise, he would not have been able to block that strike.

While he was about to claim a little interest back, there’s an old saying — to repay enmity with enmity, and kindness with kindness. It had always been Yang Kai’s principle to not swallow his anger.

His eyes flickered as Yang Kai gradually retracted his hostility.

He did not have absolute confidence in killing that old man; the opponent’s realm was too high. Even with the newly acquired methods, he was not certain he could defeat him.

He needed to think things through carefully.

“Brother Yang.” Tao Yang’s expression was serious. He looked at Yang Kai and said, “We discussed earlier that staying here is not a long-term solution.”

“En.” Yang Kai felt the same way. Earlier, they couldn’t escape because countless Evil Spirits were gathering around them, leaving no path for retreat. They could only take refuge on this central high platform. Now that the Evil Spirits had gathered nearby, it would undoubtedly be safer outside. He paused and asked, “What do you think?”

“We want to leave this place,” Shen Yi frowned and said, “but we also have concerns. Once we step off this high platform, we might be targeted by the Evil Spirits and find it hard to get away.”

“What should I do?” They were looking to Yang Kai as their backbone, and Yang Kai naturally understood their hopes rested on him.

“Brother Yang, can you maintain such a large defensive shield while flying?” Shen Yi asked, somewhat embarrassed. There were many people, with the most being from Ghost King Valley, followed by four from Baoqi Sect, and finally the Sisters from the Hu Family; it was truly unreasonable to expect Yang Kai to protect all of them single-handedly.

Moreover, they did not know how much True Yuan he had left to expend.

“I haven’t tried it, but it should be possible.” After thinking carefully, Yang Kai realized that maintaining such a large defensive shield would certainly consume a lot of True Yuan, but he still had quite a bit of Yang Liquid stored in his Dantian.

“If that’s the case, then we might as well take a risk,” Shen Yi nodded slightly.

Boom, boom…

Just as everyone was deliberating, a sudden series of rapid, powerful thumping sounds echoed nearby. It sounded as if a massive heart was making noise.

Everyone’s expression changed, looking toward the sound.

After waiting for a moment, the thumping noise came again.

This time, everyone could see clearly that the water of the Evil Spirit Spring Eye was churning.

The Corrupted Fountain Water below the high platform suddenly began to boil, bubbling up one large bubble after another, and with each bubble that emerged, it burst, erupting a wave of evil energy.

As the bubbles exploded, the entire Corrupted Fountain Water below surged violently, rising rapidly.
