## Chapter 773 — A Great Humiliation

Though members of the Yang Clan felt some restraint about provoking the Divine Tree, they truly did not take a warrior like Yang Kai seriously; in their eyes, once a suitable chance appeared and the Divine Tree's guard slipped for a moment, they could kill Yang Kai in one stroke.

So when Yang Kai spoke, the Yang Clan leader refused without a second thought.

A humiliating disgrace! In their own home, the Divine Tree—cherished as the clan's treasure and foundation—had been beguiled by an outsider boy; this was nothing short of the Yang Clan's shame, and not killing Yang Kai would not ease their fury.

Yang Kai sneered. Elevated and secure amid the Divine Tree's many protective branches, he looked down on them with contempt and said coldly, "I think I deserve it."

As he spoke, a strange Divine Sense burst forth from his Sea of Consciousness.

This Divine Sense bore no killing intent and no attack, yet when it swept across several Yang Clan members, they suddenly screamed in agony, clutching their heads as they collapsed to the ground, wailing pitifully.

Three breaths later, their movements stiffened, life faded, and blood poured from their seven orifices—they died.

The remaining Yang Clan members turned ashen; the leader could not believe his eyes, and the cold light in his pupils trembled.

Even he did not realize what trick Yang Kai had employed, yet these several fairly capable clansmen had dropped dead on the spot.

A chill rose from the depths of their hearts; those still alive now looked at Yang Kai with a changed expression, full of terror.

"You brat... you're provoking me." The Yang Clan leader's voice was low, his murderous intent as thick as a tangible thing.

Yang Kai's face remained indifferent; he shook his head and smiled, "I'm only proving that I have bargaining chips to talk with you."

His tone hardened: "My patience is thin, old dog—answer me quickly, or everyone here, except those in the Saint Realm, will die!"

At those words, most of the Yang Clan took a fearful step back. They thought that keeping some distance might make them safer, unaware that their Sea of Consciousness had long been invaded and lying dormant with the Soul Devouring Worm.

The Yang Clan leader inhaled in great gasps, glaring at Yang Kai with hatred and venom, and after a long moment shouted, "What do you want?"

"Let us leave! That's the only demand." Yang Kai called out.

"Leader, we cannot let him go—our losses are so severe. How can we let him walk away? That'd be too lenient!" someone immediately objected.

"Yes—if we don't kill him, my anger will never subside!"

"Kill him, we must kill him—even if it means damaging the Divine Tree!"

Several Saint Realm experts clamored together, set on slaying Yang Kai with no room for discussion.

Yang Kai chuckled and shouted down, "Your losses are indeed heavy, but you should realize you also stand to gain much. Your Divine Tree has given birth to its own awareness; it's not even comparable to before. If I leave, and you take the time to court it properly and win its approval, you will reap unimaginable benefits in the future!"

No sooner had he spoken than the great Divine Tree shuddered. From its trunk a dissatisfied divine thought and a hint of grievance were conveyed, as if it felt saddened by Yang Kai's intent to abandon it.

Yang Kai's heart jolted and he quickly sent a calming Divine Sense to it, saying, "If you let me stay, the situation will be different. I am the one who gave the Divine Tree this form of life, so it is very close to me now. Give me enough time and I can make it belong only to me forever; by then, even if you try to seize it you won't be able to. That won't take long—maybe days or a dozen days. If I were you, I'd send anyone who endangers the clan's interests away as soon as possible!"

The Yang Clan members' brows all furrowed.

Yang Kai spoke from their perspective—though it sounded like deception, the argument had merit and reason behind it.

The Divine Tree's dramatic change could be seen as a blessing; setting aside prior losses, such a transformation would be a monumental boon to the Yang Clan.

A Divine Tree endowed with intelligence and a spirit—this was something the Yang Clan had never dared imagine.

"We can still kill you and root out the problem!" The Yang Clan leader looked tempted, but thinking of his clan's losses he still couldn't bring himself to spare Yang Kai; gritting his teeth he said, "As long as you die, the Divine Tree will still belong to our clan."

"Fine!" Yang Kai laughed. "You do have the power to kill me — I'm not blind to that. But I can at least take some of you with me; only if you can bear that cost. Besides, to kill me you'd have to damage the Divine Tree. If you wound it, will it still accept you? This little thing's mind is simple now—harm it and it will remember for a lifetime. Old dog, don't risk a petty gain only to suffer a far greater loss; you might lose both the prize and your forces. Where will you hide your face then?"

Yang Kai's words made the leader's face darken; his expression twisted with a mix of rage and helplessness.

Those who had been clamoring to kill Yang Kai also frowned—quietly they realized the problem was trickier than expected.

If the Divine Tree had no intelligence or spirit, they could risk injuring it to take Yang Kai.

But since the Divine Tree had its own mind, they dared not act rashly, fearing that if Yang Kai's warning proved true the tree would hold a grudge and refuse to supply Yang attribute energy to them—then the Yang Clan would be finished.

All eyes turned to the leader; nobody else wanted to speak up and force a decision.

The Yang Clan leader pondered for a long moment, then coldly looked up at Yang Kai and demanded, "Can you guarantee that once you leave the Divine Tree will accept us?"

"Why should I guarantee that? Work for it yourselves. It would be best if you treated me more kindly now—your viciousness makes it unhappy."

As if responding to Yang Kai, the Divine Tree's branches and dense leaves rustled loudly, like a giant in anger.

Many Yang Clan experts frowned, a pang of shame rising in them; one by one they curbed their hostility, though their faces remained sullen.

"Hm, smile a bit more—meeting is fate; we're all friends, right?"

"Boy, don't get cocky!" The Yang Clan leader's face lengthened; he was displeased.

Yang Kai sneered and curled his lip.

"Fine, I'll let you go—just don't cross my path again." The Yang Clan leader bellowed.

"Smart move." Yang Kai looked at him approvingly and added, "Not only let me go, but my companion as well—oh, and the two demon folk."

The leader frowned. "Those two demon folk you want to take too? They have nothing to do with you."

"I'm soft-hearted—I like helping others; I can't stand to see people suffer!"

An Ling'er, who had been hiding behind Yang Kai, rolled her eyes the moment she heard that.

"Besides, your Divine Tree has fully evolved and now possesses wisdom and awareness; you no longer need to perform blood sacrifices with demon kin—do the humane thing." Yang Kai continued to persuade.

The Yang Clan leader nodded slightly and shouted, "Bring those two demon folk over!"

Someone hurried off toward the palace where they were being held.

Yang Kai waited on the trunk for a moment, and the Yang Clan guards soon dragged Gou Chi and the other demon folk over.

Gou Chi's face was sullen; he struggled, but his resistance only made matters worse—he arrived with a bruised, battered face, clearly badly beaten.

"Brother Gou Chi!" Yang Kai called from the trunk.

Gou Chi frowned and looked up; his expression shifted oddly and he nodded slightly without speaking, suspiciously scanning his surroundings.

He could sense the tense atmosphere and didn't know what had happened; it was best to remain silent for fear of saying something foolish.

"Hoist them up." Yang Kai patted the Divine Tree and commanded.

In the next moment, two long, whip-like energy tendrils lashed out, wrapping Gou Chi and the other demon folk and lifting them into the air; they were gently placed onto the tree's trunk.

Once on the trunk, Gou Chi quickly asked in a low voice, "Brother, what's going on now?"

"I'm taking you with me!" Yang Kai chuckled.

Gou Chi's face changed slightly. "Where to?"

"We're leaving this place."

Gou Chi gaped and glanced down. "They agreed?"

"Even if they don't, they'll have to. Don't worry, I've already made the deal."

"It doesn't look like it—they seemed like they wanted to finish you off. Would they really let you go?" Gou Chi was utterly bewildered.

Yang Kai nodded seriously without elaborating, then shouted down, "Where is the exit?"

The Yang Clan leader's expression turned grim; he inhaled deeply and pointed in a direction.

Yang Kai glanced that way and patted the Divine Tree.

In the next moment the massive Divine Tree began to move. With dull, earth-shaking groans, it carried Yang Kai and the three others toward that direction.

A group of Yang Clan experts trailed closely behind.

Gou Chi couldn't help widening his eyes, staring at the walking tree and exclaiming, "Brother, what kind of technique is this? Why is this tree... walking by itself?"

"Heh, the Divine Tree has given birth to its own consciousness and intelligence; it understands my words."

"Never heard of such a thing..." Gou Chi couldn't believe it. He peered all around, noticing the tree's internal energy forming pillar-like limbs that supported the massive body like legs.

In an instant, Gou Chi felt his eyes opened wider than ever; the other demon was likewise stunned and silent for a long time.
