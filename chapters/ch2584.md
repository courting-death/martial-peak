## Chapter 2584 — It’s Really Not Fake

If anyone else dared say they disliked Cang Gou, he would have already rushed up and torn them apart.

But the person before him had the right to say it. Not only did Cang Gou genuinely like this person, but in terms of strength, he couldn’t compare to Luan Feng.

Even among Divine Spirits, there are differences in strength. In ancient times, there was even a Divine Spirit ranking, with the Dragon and Phoenix at the top, looking down on all others! Those Divine Spirits at the bottom of the list were simply not in the same league as these two.

Luan Feng was from a branch of the Phoenix Clan. Though she couldn't compare to her ancestors' power, she was exceptionally formidable in her own right, especially with that World-Ending Black Flame—a technique that was extremely troublesome to deal with.

If one had to rank the Four Great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land, Luan Feng would undoubtedly claim the first position—a fact the other three could not deny. However, these four had dwelt in the Ancient Land for countless years and would not resort to all-out warfare without necessity. Though Luan Feng possessed greater strength, should it come to a true life-or-death battle, the other three were far from weak either. Even if they couldn't drag her down with them, they would certainly be capable of inflicting grievous wounds upon her.

The Four Great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land maintained a precarious balance among themselves, each restraining the other.

After being harshly scorned by Luan Feng, Cang Gou couldn’t help but feel both embarrassed and angry. He retorted, “These eyes belong to this Lord. I’ll look wherever I want.”

Luan Feng’s hand paused, and she slightly lifted her eyelids. Her beautiful eyes turned cold as she stared at Cang Gou for a moment. Suddenly, her sandalwood mouth opened, and she blew a breath in his direction.

A wisp of pitch-black flame suddenly appeared, snaking toward Cang Gou like a spirit serpent.

“World-Ending Black Flame!” Cang Gou’s face changed dramatically, realizing he’d gone too far. Luan Feng actually attacked him. In a hurry, he retreated and slapped his hands forward.

With a slap, the void shattered, and the entire stone pavilion instantly turned to dust.

Several figures darted out one after another, standing in midair.

“What are you two doing?” Fan Wu’s face was cold as he swept his gaze over Cang Gou and Luan Feng, snapping, “Why do you always act like this every time you meet?”

Luan Feng brushed the hair on her shoulder, full of charm, and said lightly, “He’s always provoking me.”

Cang Gou was furious, shouting, “I just looked at you a few times, it’s not like you’d lose a piece of flesh! Yet you want to kill me for it? Do you really think this Lord is easy to bully?”

Luan Feng's gaze turned icy as she regarded him coolly. "True, I wouldn't lose a piece of flesh. But that look in your eyes is most displeasing to me. And when I'm displeased, I act."

Cang Gou said, “Fine, fine, fine. This Lord has endured you for more than a day or two. Since you look down on me so much, let’s settle it today.”

“Alright!” Luan Feng turned, looking eager, and sneered, “I’ve also wanted to kill you for more than a day or two. Since you’re seeking death, I’ll oblige!”

“You two…” Fan Wu’s face was frosty as he gritted his teeth and barked, “Are you done yet?”

He seemed to have some authority among the four, so as soon as he spoke, both Cang Gou and Luan Feng fell silent, each turning away and snorting coldly.

Fan Wu's face darkened with frustration. "During such critical times, you two should be working together instead of turning on each other! Do you find it amusing to give the creatures below something to laugh about?"

After his scolding, both Cang Gou and Luan Feng looked embarrassed, pouting repeatedly.

Around the stone pavilion, a group of yao were indeed staring wide-eyed, apparently not understanding why the high and mighty Saint Venerables would suddenly start fighting.

“And you!” Fan Wu turned to Shi Huo.

“What’s it got to do with me?” Shi Huo shook his head, looking innocent.

“You always just watch the show. Don’t you know to stop them?” Fan Wu snorted.

Shi Huo grumbled, “They fight, I watch. It’s got nothing to do with me.”

Fan Wu’s eye twitched a few times, looking helpless. After a while, he calmed down and said, “Blood Gate has mutated. With the bloodline’s pull, all the Wild Ancient Land creatures are restless. If the four of us weren’t personally guarding this place, those Yao Kings below would already be trying to enter the Blood Gate. All of you have inherited your ancestors’ Origin Power and memories, so you should know the secret inside the Blood Gate. Back then, that person wielded the Heaven’s Punisher Sword and slaughtered all the Divine Spirits. Our ancestors barely escaped. You don’t want that person’s might to return and us to flee for our lives, do you?”

Hearing him mention that person, the other three Saint Venerables’ faces changed slightly.

In the Wild Ancient Land, even the Thirty-Two Yao Kings mostly didn’t know the secret inside the Blood Gate, but these four were different. They inherited their ancestors’ Origin Power and ancient memories, so they knew exactly what’s sealed inside the Blood Gate.

Not only was there the Origin Power of countless Divine Spirits, but also the Heaven’s Punisher Sword that made all Divine Spirits tremble in fear!

Should the Blood Gate's seal be breached and the Heaven’s Punisher Sword emerge into the world, there would be nowhere left in all the heavens for any Divine Spirit to hide. The four of them would be the first to suffer its calamity.

Because this matter was so important, the four personally came to guard here, ordering the Thirty-Two Yao Kings to protect the surroundings, not letting any creature approach the Blood Gate, fearing the seal would be broken and the Heaven’s Punisher Sword would return to the world.

Seeing the three fall silent, Fan Wu nodded slightly and said in a grave tone, "As long as the four of us remain united, even if those Yao Kings below harbor intentions, they won't dare breach the Blood Gate's forbidden grounds. We need only endure through this period, and then we can rest easy. But if you truly start fighting, the Yao Kings below will descend into chaos. Should the Blood Gate undergo any changes at that moment, who will bear the responsibility?"

His words were reasonable, and the other three Saint Venerables nodded. Cang Gou and Luan Feng also restrained their hostility, knowing now was not the time for infighting.

…

Thirty li outside Blood Gate, Xie Wuwei was leading his group of Yao Generals, scattered across an area, blocking the Wild Ancient Land creatures trying to enter the Blood Gate. He kept glancing in a certain direction.

That was where the four Saint Venerables had gathered.

He sat in a grand chair, occasionally sneering.

The Four Great Saint Venerables had gathered near the Blood Gate, and he understood perfectly why. These four powerhouses clearly didn't trust their subordinate Yao Kings. They feared these yao would succumb to the Blood Gate's forbidden allure, so they'd come personally to keep watch over everything.

In fact, it was true. If the four weren’t nearby, Xie Wuwei would have already tried to break the Blood Gate seal.

With his abilities, having cultivated to his current limit, he could never grow further. For a yao who yearned for power, this was a painful torment.

The Blood Gate’s changes gave him hope. He could sense a mysterious and powerful force inside Blood Gate, resonating with his bloodline. That was definitely a power that could give him new life, let him return to his ancestral bloodline, and become a Divine Spirit.

Once he obtained this power, he would become an existence standing equal with those four Saint Venerables. Never again would he need to heed anyone's commands.

Unfortunately… he didn’t have the chance! He couldn’t even approach Blood Gate. With the four watching, he believed he’d be blasted to pieces before he got close.

Sighing heavily, Xie Wuwei smashed the armrest of his chair, full of unwillingness. Such a great opportunity—if missed, it would be a real shame!

Just then, he seemed to sense something, turned to look in another direction, and his heart skipped a beat.

Frowning in thought for a while, he leisurely stood up.

Nearby, the yao expert named Shu Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Where is the Lord going?”

“Just bored, going for a walk. Keep watching. If anyone tries to break through, kill them without mercy!” Xie Wuwei said calmly, hands behind his back.

“Yes!” Shu Yu cupped his fists in response, watching Xie Wuwei leave.

Once out of sight of his yao subordinates, Xie Wuwei’s figure flickered and vanished into the forest.

Moments later, he suddenly appeared sneakily on the trunk of a large tree, looking around suspiciously.

Just as he was confused, a figure suddenly flashed beside him, appearing out of nowhere.

Xie Wuwei was startled, his Yao Yuan surging, ready to attack in a hurry.

“Yao King, it’s me!” A familiar voice came, making Xie Wuwei forcibly hold back his power.

“Young Master Yang!” Xie Wuwei looked around, surprised, “Where did you come from?”

With his cultivation rivaling the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, he hadn’t noticed Yang Kai’s presence. It was truly astonishing.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, not answering, but said, “Yao King, I need you to do me a favor.”

Xie Wuwei immediately looked at him warily, nervous, “What is it?”

Yang Kai beckoned him over. Xie Wuwei looked disgusted but had to come closer.

Yang Kai whispered a few words in his ear.

Xie Wuwei’s face changed dramatically, shocked, “You want me to pass this message to the Saint Venerables? Isn’t that sending me to my death?”

Though he was Yang Kai’s soul slave, Xie Wuwei had no desire to do something so suicidal. He was both shocked and angry.

Yang Kai asked, “How is that sending you to your death?”

Xie Wuwei snorted, “This message is obviously fake. The Saint Venerables aren’t idiots—they’ll see through it. Once they realize, how could I survive?”

As he spoke, he shook his head like a rattle, “I won’t go, not even if you beat me! Better to die at your hands than at the furious Saint Venerables. Go ahead and do it.”

Yang Kai laughed, “Who told you the message was fake?”

Xie Wuwei glanced over, pouting, “Don’t try to fool me. That bell is known to all creatures in the Wild Ancient Land. It was taken by a human expert tens of thousands of years ago. How could it suddenly appear here again?”

Yang Kai spoke solemnly, "The matter of this bell is genuinely not fake."

Xie Wuwei’s expression trembled, shocked, “I’m just a yao, not as crafty as you humans. Don’t trick me.”

Yang Kai grinned, patting the Yao King’s shoulder, “Why would I trick you? Just pass the message to the Saint Venerables, and you’ll be fine.”
