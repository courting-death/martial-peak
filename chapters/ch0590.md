## Chapter 590 — The Battle Begins

No one knew exactly how he appeared, nor whether he had been here all along. It was not until he revealed himself that everyone caught sight of his presence.

“Two esteemed Family Heads, the matter is serious. We have come today not to engage in battle with you,” Yang Bai said calmly, his expression composed as he looked over the crowd.

“Not wanting to fight?” Yang Yinghao snorted coldly. “Then why have the Evil Lord and the Six Great Evil Kings come today?”

Yang Bai replied tranquilly, “Only to seek peace.”

“Peace?” Everyone’s expressions twisted in disbelief. No one expected Yang Bai to say such words.

Yang Bai ignored them and fixed his gaze on Yang Kai, scrutinizing him carefully. His expression grew more solemn than ever as he said, “Nephew, long time no see.”

“Senior Uncle, I hope you have been well!” Yang Kai smiled broadly.

Yang Bai gave a slight nod. “I have underestimated you, Nephew. I never imagined you would become my greatest opponent. To have achieved this much, you are indeed remarkable.”

“Senior Uncle, you flatter me. The times create heroes. I should be the one thanking you for giving me the chance to showcase my abilities.”

“We are family; no need for formalities.” Yang Bai's face darkened, his mood clearly sour. Though he was supremely skilled, he had evidently misjudged the situation. He never expected such a young man as Yang Kai to stir such great turmoil—forcing him to reveal himself proactively today.

“Nephew, my presence here is a sincere attempt to negotiate peace,” Yang Bai said earnestly. “Although the combined strength you have gathered now probably exceeds that of my Sacred Land, if a battle truly breaks out, how many of us do you think will survive? Why not just call a halt here?”

“All right.” Yang Kai nodded heavily. “If that is your intention, Senior Uncle, how could I disobey? I also do not wish to be enemies with a master such as yourself.”

“You are indeed reasonable, nephew.” Yang Bai chuckled lightly.

Yang Kai’s face turned cold. “However, before we speak of peace, Senior Uncle, I must ask you to hand over the head first. My father and grandfather are both very concerned about you.”

“Impertinent!” The Heaven-Dominating Force King roared furiously. “You brat—”

Before he could finish, Yang Bai raised his hand to stop him.

Yang Bai shook his head slowly. “It appears, nephew, that you are determined to be my enemy.”

He wore the expression of one deeply pained, clearly lamenting Yang Kai’s choice.

“Nephew, your decision will determine life and death for countless people. Many will be torn asunder. I implore you to reconsider.” Yang Bai made one last plea.

“You should ask the Eight Great Families. Ask Zhongdu. Whether they want peace with you!” Yang Kai snapped coldly.

Yang Bai sighed softly. “If that is the case, there is nothing more to say.”

At his words, everyone’s aura surged.

Yang Kai locked eyes with Yang Bai and suddenly roared, “Begin!”

The powerful warriors of the Eight Great Families ascended en masse. From Yang Kai’s residence, concealed fighters appeared from the crowd. Thirteen Blood Servants, Lü Si, Li Yuanchun, Ling Taixu, and ten newly joined Transcendent Realm warriors—all surged forth, channeling their True Yuan to besiege the Six Great Evil Kings.

A raucous, sinister laugh echoed. The Poison King’s form flickered, releasing a vast cloud of emerald green poison mist that drifted downwards, spreading over the battlefield.

The Ghost King relentlessly unleashed waves of vengeful soul spirits, their banshee wails stirring chilling gusts through Zhongdu.

The Lightning Shadow King transformed into a streak of lightning, so fast few could perceive him. Only one shadow clung closely at his heel—Ying Jiu.

Having risen to the Transcendent Realm, Ying Jiu could not quite match the Lightning Shadow King's speed but could somewhat restrain him.

The Heaven-Dominating Force King’s thunderous roar shook the heavens as his fierce fist crashed down without flourish. The force pulverized the Yang Family's Sacrificial Altar into shards. The ground within dozens of zhang caved in instantly.

The Thunder Beast King howled sharply as numerous Fifth and Sixth-Tier demonic beasts surged forward from afar. Leading them was a Seventh-Tier demonic beast — the Spider Mother.

The warriors from the Cangyun Evil Land took to the air or rode their beasts, their momentum like a rainbow charging toward the fray.

Five of the Six Great Evil Kings attacked without hesitation.

Only Shan Qingluo hesitated, her expression complex as she quietly retreated a few steps, casually dispersing her True Yuan, emanating bewitching, unsettling energy.

She did not want to fight, but with Yang Bai right there, she had to make a show.

“Traitor, today is your death!” Ling Taixu pointed his finger directly at the Evil Lord Yang Bai and joined forces with some Transcendent Realm warriors of the Eight Great Families to assault him.

“Master…” Yang Bai looked at him with pity, but did not engage them head-on. Instead, his figure flickered, transforming into a gleam of azure light, vanishing without a trace.

No one knew where he had gone.

An unprecedented battle erupted in an instant.

The Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, Yang Kai’s residence warriors, and the invaders from Cangyun Evil Land poured nearly all their strength into this clash.

Centered around the Yang Family, martial skills and Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures unleashed dazzling radiant flashes. The Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth grew chaotic as energy rampaged.

The newly appointed heads of the Seven Great Families wished to join but were tightly guarded by their own sects. Until the situation became clearer, these seven families would not recklessly charge out.

Only Yang Kai led Di Mo, weaving deftly through the battlefield.

Within his Sea of Consciousness, Golden Pupil Eye continually emitted a massive attractive force. Whenever a Divine Roaming Realm expert died within twenty zhangs, Yang Kai could absorb the residual Divine Sense energy into his Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai avoided trouble with Transcendent Realm experts; his targets were only those of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Even peak Divine Roaming Realm warriors were no match for him now, with or without Di Mo’s assistance.

The Transcendent Realm warriors of Cangyun Evil Land numbered barely a dozen, insufficient at all against the combined forces of the Eight Great Families and Yang Kai’s residential faction.

Yang Yinghao was right: if Yang Kai’s faction and the Eight Great Families joined forces, it would not be hard to drive out the Cangyun Evil Land.

The battle raged from midday until early the next morning. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, but whereas the Sacred Land and Yang Kai’s faction lost some strength, the Cangyun Evil Land’s Yuan Qi was grievously depleted.

After this battle, it would be difficult for Cangyun Evil Land to recover.

Seeing hope, the warriors of the Eight Great Families and Yang Kai’s faction fought with increasing valor, while those of the Cangyun Evil Land, beasts and warriors alike, were steadily pushed back.

Shan Qingluo, engaged with several Eight Great Families warriors, suddenly sensed a strange, mysterious aura approaching. Her heart shivered. Before she could react, Yang Bai suddenly appeared before her.

“Qingluo, come with me!” Yang Bai ordered calmly, then without waiting, struck out with a palm at the warriors besieging Shan Qingluo.

As a top-tier Transcendent Stage Three expert, Yang Bai’s strike was overwhelming. The Eight Great Families warriors could barely resist and were wounded, hurtling like kites caught in a violent wind.

Shan Qingluo’s eyes widened in shock, then she gently nodded and followed Yang Bai, vanishing into the high air.

Yang Bai waved his hand, severing their aura from those below, simply watching the raging battle coldly, showing no intention to intervene.

“Master, what is your true purpose?” Shan Qingluo gazed steadily at Yang Bai, waiting a long moment for him to speak. When he remained silent, she took the initiative.

“My purpose?” Yang Bai glanced at her.

“The disciples of the Sacred Land are suffering heavy casualties. Even the Ghost King and others are reaching their limits. Why do you not come to their aid?”

“Why should I?” Yang Bai smiled faintly. “Whether they live or die has nothing to do with me.”

“As expected, the Sacred Land is merely a pawn to you!” Shan Qingluo’s beautiful eyes flickered with complicated emotion. “The Ghost King and others have long believed that under your leadership, the Sacred Land would eventually overthrow the Eight Great Families and become the world’s pinnacle.”

“That is their wishful thinking. I never told them so,” Yang Bai admitted frankly.

“Then why call me here, Master?” Shan Qingluo’s tone fluctuated with displeasure.

“Because I need a woman standing behind me.” Yang Bai looked at her with interest, his eyes clear and devoid of lust.

Shan Qingluo laughed, teasing, “I never imagined you would be interested in women.”

“I am a man, and men need women,” Yang Bai said. “But the only woman worthy of me in this world is you. Rest assured, I will do nothing to you. I only need you to witness everything with me. A man alone is always lonely.”

“Witness? Witness what?” Shan Qingluo was taken aback.

“Soon. You’ll understand shortly.” Yang Bai smiled cryptically, a trace of excitement shimmering in his eyes—something he had never shown before—as if something thrilling was about to unfold.

“Qingluo, it seems your relationship with my nephew is not shallow,” Yang Bai remarked casually.

Shan Qingluo’s heart gave a jolt, but she quickly composed herself and said firmly, “Because of certain circumstances, I am already his woman.”

Yang Bai was surprised but unconcerned. He nodded. “Then from today onward, forget him. Although he is formidable, by following me, you will realize this world is far more complicated than you think. You will witness many things and scenes you never imagined.”

Shan Qingluo stared at him in bewilderment, unsure what he meant.

“Where is Master?” A furious roar came from the Heaven-Dominating Force King, who was being besieged by warriors from Yang Kai’s faction. Though powerful beyond measure, he was overwhelmed by multiple attackers. Watching the Sacred Land disciples fall one by one, and yet Yang Bai not intervene, the Heaven-Dominating Force King grew restless.

The Cangyun Evil Land’s boldness in invading Zhongdu relied chiefly on Yang Bai’s presence. Without him, these Evil Kings would not dare seek death here.

“Master will likely abandon us!” The Ghost King’s expression was savage. A massive black cloud enveloped him, transforming into a human face with vivid features. Mouth agape, it lunged forward, swallowing a large group of warriors whole.
