## Chapter 1085 — An Invitation with Ill Intent

The dwindling numbers and the enormous drain of energy seemed to have sobered both sides; they no longer fought heedlessly as before and became cautious at every turn.

Yang Kai waited another half day and could not help feeling bored.

As long as no one died, he couldn’t net any gains; staying here any longer would only waste time.

So he slipped away from behind the meteorite where he had been hiding, ready to continue toward his destination and, while he had the chance, to temper the divine souls of the dozens of Saint King Realm cultivators he had swallowed.

Both sides were occupied with dealing with their opponents, and no one noticed his presence.

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Yang Kai had already put a hundred li between himself and that battlefield and was about to summon his Star Shuttle when a strange and arcane fluctuation of power suddenly came from behind.

Yang Kai spun around and saw, amid the countless encircling meteorites, a bright radiance flare; the light flashed and then vanished.

Yang Kai halted, his face stunned. That ripple of energy felt very familiar—clearly it was a surge of spatial force, which meant someone had very likely torn space.

The discovery stirred him slightly. Having spent several years in the Star Domain and gathered information from many sources, he knew well that those proficient in spatial power were frighteningly few; across the entire Star Domain there were scarcely any.

Spatial power is an extremely esoteric discipline—hard to enter, hard to master, and infinitely harder to refine to the utmost.

To find such a thing here made Yang Kai eager to investigate; he wanted to see who it was, to learn whether he could borrow or study their methods, and if possible to exchange techniques.

He extended his Divine Sense, which soon reached the earlier battlefield. Yang Kai’s expression grew more puzzled—he found that the place was now utterly deserted, only a faint spatial force slowly diffusing.

What had happened?

Unable to suppress his curiosity, Yang Kai turned and rushed back.

Before long he once again arrived at the battlefield, looking around; the place was indeed deserted, the several who had been fighting earlier had long since vanished, and oddly there were no corpses to be found nearby.

Following the faint spatial force, Yang Kai stopped atop a meteorite the size of a small mountain and stood before a hollow gate; the gate was extremely archaic and plainly very old. A thick layer of Ethereal Crystal was inlaid along the doorframe.

At the gate’s base were two grooves for placing Saint Crystals; in those grooves two Upper-Level Saint Crystals lay dim and without light—their internal energies had been exhausted.

"A Space Array?" Yang Kai’s eyes widened as he cried out in astonishment.

He had not expected matters to be different from what he had thought—the faint spatial fluctuation was not caused by someone tearing space, but by a Space Array having been activated.

Those two spent Saint Crystals were likely what had been used to power the Space Array’s activation.

How could a Space Array exist in this place? Then the cultivator who had been searching the meteorites during the great battle—had his target been this Space Array?

Where did the other end of the Space Array lead?

The two missing groups must have been transported away through the Space Array. Standing before it, Yang Kai’s face shifted as his mind raced.

After a moment he reached out, removed the two depleted Saint Crystals from the base, replaced them with two intact Upper-Level Saint Crystals, poured True Yuan into them, and compelled the Space Array to operate.

A bright light suddenly appeared; ripples rose at the center of the gate, gradually turning unreal and illusory.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense Threads penetrated the gate and matched the Array’s power fluctuations; under the array’s function they spanned tens of thousands of li in an instant.

He saw no people, only a bizarre land—verdant trees, bright sunlight, and a thriving earth; at a glance it was clear this was a prosperous continent.

Retracting his Divine Sense, Yang Kai did not hesitate and walked toward the Space Array’s gateway.

In the blink of an eye he found himself standing on the continent he had just glimpsed.

The Spiritual Qi pressed upon him; Yang Kai was slightly moved—this continent’s Spiritual Qi was denser even than Rainfall Star’s. While it could not compare to a Floating Continent, it was by no means something other cultivation stars could match.

The pattern of the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid on his chest finally exerted its great effect; beneath the gaping maw, great torrents of Spiritual Qi actively surged toward Yang Kai’s body.

A look of exhilaration crossed Yang Kai’s face; he even felt the urge to seclude himself here in retreat until the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid’s effects wore off.

The Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid was exceedingly rare. If not for Xue Yue, Halika would never have bestowed such an extraordinary treasure upon Yang Kai. Though its efficacy would last only two to three years before gradually fading, only half that time had passed so far.

Yang Kai did not wish to waste it.

No sooner had the thought occurred than Yang Kai inwardly cursed.

Back in the Starry Sky he could perfectly conceal his aura, but here he could not; even if he drew in his own aura, the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid would continue devouring the world’s Spiritual Qi, and such an anomaly would be easily detected.

Sure enough, barely had the worry arisen when, one by one, cultivators who had arrived here earlier flew over from a distance at high speed.

There were not many—each side only three or five people—and they too found it strange that anyone would trespass here.

In a short while the two sides who had been fighting earlier had gathered together; each person stared at Yang Kai with curiosity, not knowing which side he belonged to.

The yao giant called Diji looked astonished and chuckled, "Kid, why is it you?"

The woman who had been following him looked at Yang Kai oddly, her beautiful eyes full of vigilance; she presumed Yang Kai had tracked them here.

"Don’t misunderstand, I don’t know them; I only met them once in the Starry Sky," Yang Kai ignored Diji and explained to the other group that glowered at him.

The leader of that group likewise stepped forward—a man who seemed only in his forties but whose strength matched Diji’s, reaching the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

He walked out from his group and asked in a deep voice, "How did you find this place?"

Yang Kai shrugged. "I was just passing by, saw a cluster of light in the Meteorite Sea and followed it out of curiosity. I didn’t expect a Space Array; I only came to have a look. Do what you were going to do and don’t bother with me—I’ll look and leave."

As he spoke he remained secretly wary; though both parties were few in number, each had experts at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and both were highly suspicious of him—if things went wrong he could be surrounded and attacked.

He had to lower his posture and schemed how to make them fight on a bit longer; if they died off completely, he would have ample time to search this continent for anything of value.

The man who had spoken earlier gazed at Yang Kai as if peering into his heart; after a long while he nodded, a gleam suddenly appearing in his eyes. He softened and smiled, "I believe you."

"Thanks," Yang Kai inclined his head in acknowledgement.

"Kid, since you came here you shouldn’t think of leaving," Diji sneered. "I didn’t want trouble in the Starry Sky and didn’t bother dealing with you then, but here? Where do you expect to run?"

Saying that, he shouted to the middle-aged man, "Guiche. Our Saint Crystals and recovery pills have been heavily consumed—this kid is a fat sheep. The last time we met he tossed down a thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals, each of excellent grade. I bet his Spatial Ring holds even more. How about we split him between us?"

"That’s a fine suggestion," Guiche nodded lightly, laughing as he looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled back at him, his expression indifferent.

Diji laughed loudly. "Guiche, though I look down on you, you are a straightforward sort and I admire that—so tell me, will you strike first or shall I? Or shall we both strike to avoid suspicion?"

Guiche shook his head slowly. "I won’t strike."

Diji was momentarily stunned, still not understanding what Guiche meant, when Guiche affably said to Yang Kai, "Young brother, want to come with us?"

"Come with you?" Yang Kai frowned. "Come with you to do what?"

"Explore this place together. This place hasn’t been visited for a long time; there are many good things waiting for us to develop. Follow us and you won’t be without benefit—what do you say?" Guiche extended the invitation with sincere eyes.

Hearing this, everyone was astonished; they didn’t know why Guiche would invite a cultivator only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—both Diji’s people and Guiche’s own companions wore sceptical expressions.

Only the yao expert Diji, who seemed rough but was extremely shrewd, instantly saw through Guiche’s plan and chuckled, "Guiche, aren’t you being shameless? If you want this kid to go scout dangerous spots for you, just say so—luring him with profit is nothing. Kid, don’t listen to his idle talk. I guarantee that if you agree you not only won’t gain anything, you’ll die without a grave."

Diji’s words exposed the scheme and everyone suddenly understood.

Guiche showed no shame; his expression grew even more earnest. "Indeed, I had that thought. But young brother, your strength is low—without paying a price you cannot obtain benefits. Follow me and you’ll have a sliver of survival; I will not send you to the truly perilous places. If you follow Diji, you won’t live to see tomorrow."

"Can I act alone? Just pretend you didn’t see me," Yang Kai said with a troubled look.

Everyone burst into laughter, their faces mocking.

"Fine, it seems if I don’t pick a side I’ll be killed immediately, right?"

Diji and Guiche fell silent; the former continued to sneer, his intent plain.
