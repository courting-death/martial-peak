## Chapter 2013 — Stole Someone Else's Benefit

That day, Yang Kai was flying close to the ground when his body suddenly paused; he looked up at the distant sky.

Far off, streaks of light were cutting across the heavens, falling down toward the earth like a brilliant meteor shower.

Those streaks of light were, unmistakably, the fragmentary Power of the Laws he had been seeking for days, only now their scale was vastly greater than the first time he had encountered them—there were countless times more.

Overjoyed, he stopped hesitating and abruptly accelerated toward them.

Three hours later, Yang Kai arrived at a valley.

What met his eyes immediately rooted him to the spot.

In the center of the valley there was a huge cluster of luminous presence radiating a blazing light, and even as he watched, streams of light continued to fall from the sky, converging into that radiance and increasing its brilliance.

This cluster of light was evidently the accumulation of those streaks from the sky.

“So much!” Even though Yang Kai had prepared himself mentally, the scene before him still stunned him.

The streams he and the Xuan Realm Pearl had absorbed before probably didn't amount to even one percent of what lay here; yet those small gains had already benefited Yang Kai tremendously and caused major changes in the Xuan Realm Pearl. If he could absorb all the streams here, his comprehension of the Power of the Laws would likely leap to the Dao Origin Realm, making future advancement far easier.

Moreover, the Small Xuan Realm inside the Xuan Realm Pearl could undergo fundamental changes.

With delight on his face, Yang Kai shot forward and stopped at a distance of roughly thirty zhang from the light.

It wasn't that he didn't want to get closer—rather, the Power of the Laws in that light was far too vast for him to approach. If he rushed in, he would likely be ground to pieces by those chaotic Laws.

The light cluster itself even buzzed from being so enormous, looking very unstable.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, released the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal to guard nearby, then sat cross‑legged and began to run his cultivation method.

In an instant, as if pulled by an invisible force, rays of profound light shot out from the huge cluster toward where Yang Kai sat. These rays had no killing intent; they streamed into Yang Kai’s body and vanished.

The moment the profound light flowed in, Yang Kai felt he could perceive the subtleties of the Laws.

He no longer hesitated; he immersed his mind and concentrated on comprehension.

He was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. He simply could not absorb all that profound light; as before, once his body exceeded its limit, the excess would flow into the Xuan Realm Pearl and become part of the Small Xuan Realm, perfecting that realm’s Laws.

Time slowly passed.

Yang Kai’s expression began to change constantly—sometimes frowning, sometimes easing, sometimes dazed, sometimes struck with sudden insight…

And from the light cluster, the profound lights being emitted grew ever more numerous and dense.

Yet Yang Kai seemed like a bottomless pit; no matter how much light came, he absorbed it without fail.

Time flashed past—three or four days went by.

Thanks to Yang Kai’s unreserved absorption, the huge light cluster had already shrunk several times over and its emitted radiance was not as strong as before, though rays of profound light still continued to shoot out and flow into Yang Kai and disappear.

At one point, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, a pensive look crossing his face.

After a moment of contemplation, he drew his finger through the space before him; a faint, inexplicable force flowed from his fingertip, and where he sliced the air a pitch‑black spatial rift abruptly formed.

Yang Kai had not used his own spatial power to do this—this was possible only because of the Power of the Laws of heaven and earth he'd begun to touch.

A Dao Origin Realm cultivator who had initially perceived the Laws could mobilize the Power of the Laws to augment his attacks.

Yang Kai had now clearly touched the edge of the Laws, all owing to these recent days of unbounded comprehension and absorption.

However… his grasp was still shallow, so the tiny rift promptly healed itself and could not be held.

He shifted his Divine Sense and examined the Void Mind Crystal within his body.

The Void Mind Crystal, which had always been dark as a black hole, now had a faint phosphorescent glow flowing over its surface.

Yang Kai’s Void Mind Crystal condensed all his insights and experience of spatial power, granting him enhancements in spatial applications; having now perceived the Power of the Laws, the Void Mind Crystal carried some of that lawly power as well, becoming more unfathomable.

From now on, if Yang Kai wished, he could call upon a sliver of the Power of the Laws of heaven and earth.

And it was the strange, inscrutable Law of space!

This amplification was a qualitative change, a fundamental transformation. Though with his current strength he could not use it often, once he advanced to the Dao Origin Realm the situation would be entirely different.

He closed his eyes in satisfaction and resumed absorbing the profound light, the Small Xuan Realm doing the same.

Two more days passed, and the light had shrunk more than tenfold; its glow dimmed as if scarcely anything remained after such sustained absorption.

Yang Kai did not notice this at all; he remained immersed in his own comprehension.

Suddenly, a faint groan came from the light ahead. The sound was soft, yet unmistakably real.

Yang Kai at first assumed it was his imagination, but when a second groan sounded he changed expression and hurriedly opened his eyes.

Meanwhile, affected by the change of his mood, the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal swiftly returned from their vigil and guarded by his side.

Yang Kai, however, gaped with wide eyes, staring blankly ahead with a look of disbelief; after a long moment he murmured, “There’s actually someone?”

Only then did he realize that inside the light cluster there was a human figure.

Previously the light had been too bright and the Power of the Laws too dense for him to notice any anomaly inside; only when the light had weakened to a certain degree did the figure become visible.

Was this person originally inside, or had they entered later?

And who exactly were they?

Yang Kai was completely baffled.

From the graceful silhouette, the presence inside the light was evidently that of a woman.

Yang Kai immediately thought of Mo Xiaoqi.

After all, within this Third Stage there were now only him and Mo Xiaoqi alive. Yet thinking carefully, that seemed impossible—he and Mo Xiaoqi had gone in opposite directions; how could she already be hidden in this light cluster?

Besides, the figure’s curves differed slightly from Mo Xiaoqi’s.

Could it be one of those old monsters sealed here? Yang Kai recalled the Mu Xiao he had encountered on the second layer and could not help but shiver.

At that moment he noticed the woman on the other side flutter her eyelids and, through the light, glance at him with a pair of bright eyes.

Yang Kai narrowed his brow and rose, watching warily.

To his surprise, she only looked at him once and then closed her beautiful eyes again, as if he did not exist.

He soon understood why she acted that way.

Shortly after the woman closed her eyes, Spiritual Qi undulated in the sky above; near where she was, piece after piece of high‑grade Source Crystal exploded, turning into pure, dense Spiritual Qi and converging in one place.

Thunder suddenly rumbled overhead and a vast bank of black clouds formed, within which flashes of lightning even appeared.

The Spiritual Qi formed from the shattered Source Crystals madly gathered upward, and in the blink of an eye an extremely terrifying phenomenon manifested.

“Breakthrough!” Yang Kai involuntarily stepped back several paces, his face changing.

The woman was evidently about to break through to a higher great realm here, and the phenomenon before them was clearly the heaven‑and‑earth baptism required for a major breakthrough.

At that moment Yang Kai also realized the woman’s true cultivation—she was the same as him, both at the peak of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; if she broke through, she would reach the Dao Origin Realm.

This woman should not be some ancient sealed monster but a cultivator, like him, who had entered from Fenglin City, Yang Kai concluded.

He did not know by what method she had managed to reach the Third Stage either.

That thought made Yang Kai’s heart tighten.

No matter who she was, if she had penetrated to the Third Stage she was clearly extraordinary, and her purpose in coming to the Third Stage was most likely to break through her own realm.

The huge light ball must have been what she had gathered; in other words, he had apparently taken advantage of someone else’s accumulation.

Cold sweat broke out over Yang Kai.

This was no place to linger!

If she advanced and came to find trouble with him…

Yang Kai was not particularly afraid of a newly advanced Dao Origin Realm cultivator, but it would certainly be trouble, so once he realized this he immediately intended to make himself scarce.

At that moment the woman seemed to see through Yang Kai’s intention; she abruptly spoke, “Stand there obediently and don’t move, or I’ll make you regret it!”

Her voice was clear and pleasant, extraordinarily beautiful.

Yang Kai had already decided to leave; why would he bother with her?

He waved his hand, recalled the two Blood Beasts, and prepared to fly off.

The woman snorted coldly; she lifted a slender jade hand and a vast shimmer of starlight appeared upon it. In an instant the starlight coalesced into an arrow, and with a flick she sent it straight at Yang Kai.

A sound of air being split rang out; before the attack arrived, Yang Kai already felt a chill at his back.

In alarm, he turned and unleashed two punches.

In an instant, winds surged and clouds billowed, condensing into a tangible gale of fist‑energy that smashed into the star‑arrow with a thunderous crash, shockwaves sweeping outward in all directions.

Riding the recoil, Yang Kai was flung a great distance.

From beginning to end, he did not utter a single word.

“You run fast!” the woman in the light snarled, her brows drawn in anger and a little bewilderment. “Strange, how could there be someone on the Third Stage, and this fellow… doesn’t seem to be an ordinary Void King Realm cultivator.”
