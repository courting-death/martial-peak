## Chapter 497 — Tang Yuxian’s Demonstration

After speaking with the Blood Servants for a while, Yang Kai dismissed them one by one.

Only Tang Yuxian remained.

Earlier, Yang Kai had made a small joke, and Tang Yuxian was still a little red-faced at this moment, unsure why Yang Kai had asked her to stay behind.

“Yuxian, we are not strangers. There are some things I won’t hide from you,” Yang Kai said solemnly, lowering his voice.

“Please speak, Young Master. I am all ears,” Tang Yuxian responded, straightening her expression.

“It’s hard to explain. Just feel for yourself!” Yang Kai finished speaking and suddenly unleashed a powerful surge of Divine Sense energy, enveloping Tang Yuxian.

Her delicate body trembled sharply. Her beautiful eyes shimmered with an extraordinary light as she looked at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“Do you feel it?” Yang Kai asked.

Tang Yuxian was stunned for a moment before slightly nodding. “Young Master, is this your own Divine Sense power?”

“That’s right.”

Yang Kai had cultivated Divine Sense energy, something Tang Yuxian and Tu Feng did not know about. This time, he wanted to ask Tang Yuxian for advice on soul matters, so he revealed a little of it in front of her.

“I see. So the Divine Sense power that burst out that night at Yang Tie’s mansion was yours, Young Master,” Tang Yuxian said with sudden comprehension. Even after several months, she still remembered clearly—on the first night of the succession war, a fierce battle broke out at Yang Tie’s residence. Yang Kai suddenly appeared and fought fiercely, while a powerful Divine Sense energy field draped over Yang Tie’s mansion, deterring all around.

At that time, she had guessed which expert that Divine Sense power belonged to, but until now, she finally understood.

“But Young Master, you are only at the Ninth Stage of the True Essence Realm now. How is it…” 

How could you possibly have the peak Divine Roaming Divine Sense power, and even had it months ago? This meant Yang Kai had been cultivating his Divine Sense power for quite some time.

“I don’t know either,” Yang Kai shook his head without elaborating. “Your soul arts skills are better than most, so I want to learn from your experience.”

Meng Wuya, the Earth Demon—both are masters among masters. Their accomplishments in soul arts would not be inferior to Tang Yuxian’s, but everyone has their own strengths.

Yang Kai was only one step away from the Divine Roaming Realm and naturally wanted to prepare in advance, especially for the challenge of breaking through the first stage of Divine Roaming Realm!

The True Essence Realm was a watershed for martial artists. The Primordial Qi inside would transform into True Essence, becoming denser, purer, and more powerful.

The Divine Roaming Realm was another huge divide for martial artists. In this realm, a warrior would open their own Sea of Consciousness, nurturing and cultivating Divine Sense power.

“What exactly do you want to ask, Young Master?” Tang Yuxian asked calmly after regaining her composure.

“For example, how did you open your own Sea of Consciousness back then?” Yang Kai pondered.

“As I recall, I took some rare heaven-and-earth treasures that replenish Divine Sense,” Tang Yuxian recalled slowly. “It’s hard to explain. How about this—Young Master, I’ll demonstrate it for you. I still remember the process.”

“Demonstrate? How?”

“Young Master, come into my Sea of Consciousness!” Tang Yuxian showed no reservation and directly lowered her Sea of Consciousness defenses.

“Very well.” Yang Kai nodded, shaping his Divine Sense energy into a stream and rushing into Tang Yuxian’s mind.

As he looked around, an endless, clear sky and boundless, tranquil sea stretched before him. Within this vast ocean lay Tang Yuxian’s Divine Sense power. Yang Kai’s expression twitched slightly.

So far, Yang Kai had entered three people’s Sea of Consciousness in total.

The first was Shan Qingluo, the second was Senior Sister, and the third was Tang Yuxian herself.

Invading someone else’s Sea of Consciousness allowed one to clearly sense their inner changes and thoughts. It was a subtle feeling, like becoming a worm in their belly—any flicker of thought could not be hidden from the observer.

Thus, martial artists never casually lowered their Sea of Consciousness defenses for outsiders unless in very close relationships.

Each of the three Seas of Consciousness left different impressions on Yang Kai.

Shan Qingluo’s Sea of Consciousness contained an alluring charm. That vast Divine Sense ocean seemed to suck in Yang Kai’s soul, making him unable to escape.

Senior Sister’s Sea of Consciousness gave off a fresh, natural vibe. Staying there made all worries and distractions disappear. Her aura could calm Yang Kai swiftly, stilling his heart like a mirror.

Tang Yuxian’s was mature and graceful. Even the slight breeze above the sea felt like the embrace of a plump woman, enveloping Yang Kai.

At that moment, Tang Yuxian’s soul body stood not far before Yang Kai.

Suddenly, the ocean beneath swelled with waves, and the bright, clear sky began to shift and distort.

Yang Kai was startled.

Embarrassed, Tang Yuxian said, “This is the first time someone has intruded into my Sea of Consciousness. I’m a bit uncomfortable.”

The changes inside the Sea of Consciousness clearly reflected Tang Yuxian’s inner feelings. She was undoubtedly nervous now—after all, she had just laid most of her secrets bare before Yang Kai. Such exposure was embarrassing for any woman.

If Yang Kai delved deeper into her Sea of Consciousness, he could even spy on every little event from her childhood, but he definitely would not do that.

Hearing this, Yang Kai only nodded quietly, waiting for her mood to settle.

Sure enough, after a while, the sea calmed again.

“Young Master, observe carefully. I will demonstrate it now,” Tang Yuxian whispered. Suddenly, Yang Kai felt his vision darken.

Everything vanished—the ocean, the clear sky, even the gentle breeze.

Around him was complete void, as if he were in primordial chaos.

Knowing Tang Yuxian was demonstrating the opening and formation of her Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai held his breath and concentrated.

After some unknown time, within that void and chaos, one or two drifting energies appeared. Like the first life forms at the dawn of heaven and earth, they were bursting with vitality and energy fluctuations.

They were Tang Yuxian’s soul threads!

These one or two energies roamed through the chaos, like a lone boat tossed by waves, a candle flickering in a storm, or a snowflake under the scorching sun.

Delicate and fragile!

Yet, they triggered some strange change. Void and chaos were no longer the only theme here. One soul thread after another appeared, illuminating this seemingly eternal darkness.

At first, the soul threads were scattered without form. As they formed, some broke apart, returning to nothingness.

But most of the threads remained.

Gradually, this world of void and chaos became like a starry night sky, studded with countless stars, magnificent and enchanting.

Over time, these soul threads gathered together. Subtle energies twisted into a stream, accompanied by the gentle sound of flowing water.

Within that void appeared a small brook, its waters flowing steadily, stretching far ahead.

It grew grander and grander—the brook became a river, the river an ocean, radiating boundlessly in all directions.

Like the opening of heaven and earth, chaos dissipated.

Darkness was dispelled, and before Yang Kai was a boundless brightness!

A gentle breeze blew, and below, blue waters met the sky. Tang Yuxian still stood quietly before him and gently exhaled. Her soul body showed a hint of weariness.

That demonstration had surely cost her considerable effort.

“Did you understand, Young Master?”

Yang Kai nodded slightly but said nothing. He remained immersed in the realm just demonstrated: from nothingness to gradual growth.

Opening a Sea of Consciousness was equivalent to creating a world—all a world belonging to oneself alone.

Tang Yuxian’s demonstration was truly enlightening. Yang Kai now had many ideas about how to open his own Sea of Consciousness and ascend to the Divine Roaming Realm.

All he lacked now were the right time and cultivation level.

Yang Kai was confident that once he reached the Divine Roaming Realm with sufficient strength, he would open his Sea of Consciousness in no time at all.

“If Young Master wishes to refine soul power, I do have a suggestion,” Tang Yuxian said.

“Oh?” Yang Kai looked at her with some surprise.

“You could find a partner for soul cultivation… yes, double cultivation.” Tang Yuxian’s cheeks flushed.

Yang Kai smiled dryly. “Isn’t that soul intercourse?”

“Yes.” Tang Yuxian immediately felt shy, vaguely like she was encouraging the Young Master to do something mischievous.

“I’ve heard that once you try it, it’s easy to lose yourself in it,” Yang Kai said with a strange smile.

Soul intercourse—the merging of two souls—brought pleasures beyond physical union by hundreds of times. It was a resonance of souls, a trembling thrill. Though enjoyable, this fusion could easily mix memories and even drastically alter personalities, sometimes leaving people confused about their identities.

“Others might get lost, but Young Master’s resolute heart should prevent that,” Tang Yuxian paused, then added, “Absolutely no problem.”

“That confident?” Yang Kai smiled and nodded. “I’ll consider it.”

He already had someone in mind, though he wondered where she was now.

His Dual Cultivation Technique with Su Yan had only reached the Second-Tier stage. Once they reached the Third-Tier stage of Heart-to-Heart Connection, soul resonance would inevitably form.

Using it for dual cultivation to strengthen each other's Divine Sense power was not a bad idea.

“Thank you for this,” Yang Kai said seriously.

“You’re too polite, Young Master. It’s my duty,” Tang Yuxian smiled gently.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, about to exit Tang Yuxian’s Sea of Consciousness when suddenly his expression changed. He gasped softly and furrowed his brow.

“What is it?” Tang Yuxian asked in surprise.

“There’s movement!” Yang Kai’s face darkened. The next moment, he vanished.

Tang Yuxian was stunned for a moment, then quickly gathered her mind and withdrew her Sea of Consciousness defenses.

No sooner had she opened her eyes than she saw Yang Kai rise hurriedly and rush outside.

At the same time, a chilling, sinister chuckle echoed through the residence: “Since you’ve come, stop hiding and show yourself!”

An earthshaking energy fluctuation erupted from within the mansion, shaking the ground and mountains. From the corner of her eye, Tang Yuxian even saw red beams of light rising in one part of the estate.

Her expression changed, uncertain what was happening.
