## Chapter 2284 — Return to the Spiritual Pill Shop

“Indeed, the Heaven-Grade cultivation sacred land of Linghu Palace can truly rival the Heaven-Grade sacred land of Star God Palace. Which Emperor Realm expert wouldn’t want to experience it? If it could really lead to a breakthrough, any price would be worth it.” Ye Qinghan agreed, then added, “But there aren’t many Heaven-Grade cultivation chambers—only thirty in total.”

“These thirty chambers... I’m afraid those lords will fight over them until their heads are broken and blood is flowing,” Yang Kai snorted.

Thirty may seem like a lot, but in reality, it’s nowhere near enough.

Emperor Realm experts aren’t exactly common, but looking at the whole Southern Territory, there are at least eight hundred if not a thousand. Aside from the Emperor experts of Star God Palace, who probably have no interest in those specific chambers, what Emperor wouldn’t want to enter and cultivate in seclusion to comprehend profound arts?

Once the news spreads, how could thirty be enough?

“That’s a matter for the lords, not something a little nobody like me needs to worry about.” Ye Qinghan covered her mouth and giggled.

“How many Earth-Grade chambers are there? And what about Human-Grade?” Yang Kai asked again.

“For Earth-Grade, it seems there are five hundred, and as for Human-Grade, there are three thousand...”

Yang Kai nodded at her words. Although the numbers still sounded small and a bit insufficient, not everyone could afford to enter the Linghu Palace chambers to cultivate. Those unable to bear the cost could only look on in envy.

Still, with these three tiers of chambers, Fenglin City’s income would surely be enough to make anyone jealous. This revenue would inevitably be divided among the top sects, and Fenglin City might get a small share as well. Even so, people like Duan Yuanshan would probably become rich overnight.

“It’s said...” Ye Qinghan’s voice suddenly dropped, becoming mysterious. “Of course, it’s just a rumor, but it’s said that Linghu Palace has reserved some extra, non-public chambers for each major sect. As long as you’re a disciple of one of those sects, you can enter for free and cultivate as long as you like.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows. “There’s such a thing?”

Ye Qinghan said, “The source isn’t certain, but it’s pretty reliable. After all, Linghu Palace was established by the major sects, so it’s only natural they’d keep some for themselves.”

“That’s understandable,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Now, he was also a disciple of Qingyang Shrine and had a disciple identity token. If this news was true, he should be able to enter the chambers and cultivate without paying anything.

“Also, the major powers have set up an array to channel the Spiritual Qi leaking from Linghu Palace into Fenglin City, so the Spiritual Qi density in Fenglin City is much higher than before.”

“So that’s it... I was wondering why something felt off.” Yang Kai suddenly understood, finally realizing why the Spiritual Qi in Fenglin City hadn’t decreased but increased—it was because an array was guiding the Spiritual Qi from Linghu Palace over.

With this, Fenglin City was also quite suitable for martial artists to cultivate. Although it couldn’t compare to Linghu Palace, for those living in Fenglin City, it was a blessing.

“In less than two years, Fenglin City will surely become one of the great cities of the Southern Territory. I hear both major Commerce Guilds are planning to set up branches here.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Where there’s money to be made, how could the two Commerce Guilds not show up?”

As they spoke, the two had already arrived at the Spiritual Pill Shop.

The Spiritual Pill Shop was just as before—a small storefront, with hardly any customers inside. Only the shop assistant was busy greeting people, and there was no sign of the shopkeeper.

Ever since Kang Siran was transferred away, Yang Kai hadn’t visited the Spiritual Pill Shop. Now that he was back, he couldn’t help but feel a bit sentimental.

The first time he came to Fenglin City, he had formed some ties with the Spiritual Pill Shop.

“You’re... Master Yang!” a surprised voice suddenly called out, snapping Yang Kai out of his memories. He looked up to see the shop assistant staring at him excitedly.

Yang Kai grinned and greeted him cheerfully, “Young Brother, how have you been lately?”

Back when he was refining pills at the Spiritual Pill Shop, he’d interacted with this shop assistant quite a few times, so they weren’t strangers, though he never did learn the man’s name.

“Good, good, good!” The shop assistant was so excited he could barely speak, looking both flattered and overwhelmed. “Thank you for your concern, Master.”

After saying that, he hurriedly ran inside, shouting as he went, “Master Yang is back! Shopkeeper, Master Yang is back!”

“What does he mean?” Ye Qinghan looked at Yang Kai in confusion, not understanding why the shop assistant was making such a fuss.

Yang Kai said, “I used to refine pills here at the Spiritual Pill Shop for a few months.”

“So that’s how it is.”

“Let’s go in.” Yang Kai gestured. After the shop assistant’s shout, the few customers browsing for pills all looked at him strangely. He called to Ye Qinghan and walked straight inside.

Before they reached the back, a fat man with a round face, oily skin, and luxurious clothes came out to meet them. He looked about forty, with a big belly and a prosperous air.

This was clearly the new shopkeeper of the Spiritual Pill Shop. Like Kang Siran before him, he was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

The fat man wiped sweat from his forehead and asked anxiously, “Where is Master Yang?”

As he spoke, he looked up and saw Yang Kai, quickly cupping his fists. “Zhou Fu of the Spiritual Pill Shop greets Master Yang. Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner.”

Yang Kai cupped his fists in return and smiled, “I came unannounced, Shopkeeper Zhou, you’re too polite!”

They had barely exchanged a few words when two more men rushed out from the back, shouting, “Who is Master Yang? Which one is Master Yang!”

One of them looked around, his gaze instantly locking onto Yang Kai. He barked, “You are Master Yang?”

Yang Kai glanced at him and saw a man with disheveled hair, sunken eyes, and bloodshot eyeballs, looking like he hadn’t rested in ages. The other man was the same, and both carried a faint medicinal scent.

Yang Kai immediately understood what they did. He smiled slightly and said, “I don’t dare claim the title of master, but yes, I am Yang.”

At his words, both men’s eyes lit up, and they stared at Yang Kai with burning gazes, cupping their fists together. “Greetings, Master Yang.”

“No need to be so formal.” Yang Kai smiled and turned to Zhou Fu. “Shopkeeper, could we talk inside...?”

He gestured around. The customers in the shop were all staring at him in confusion, guessing what kind of big shot he must be to receive such a grand welcome from the shopkeeper and others.

Zhou Fu said awkwardly, “It was my oversight. Master Yang, this way please!”

“Master Yang, please!” The two men quickly stepped aside, looking extremely respectful.

“Serve tea, serve the best tea!” Zhou Fu said, kicking the gawking shop assistant, who hurried off to comply.

Soon after, in a back chamber, Yang Kai sat down, with Ye Qinghan standing behind him like a bodyguard, and Zhou Fu and the others standing nearby.

“You all should sit as well,” Yang Kai gestured.

“No, no, no, in front of Master Yang, how could we dare sit? Standing is fine for us,” Zhou Fu quickly waved his hands.

“Exactly, exactly!”

“Kneeling would be fine too!” the two men chimed in, making Ye Qinghan giggle. She didn’t understand why Yang Kai was so highly regarded here.

Yang Kai didn’t insist, only asking, “Any news of Shopkeeper Kang lately?”

Zhou Fu’s expression turned serious. “Shopkeeper Kang has sent me messages many times, asking about Master Yang’s situation. I’m ashamed to say I haven’t been able to meet you or find out anything, but fortunately, news from Four Seasons Land came out recently, so I finally had something to report.” Zhou Fu smiled bitterly as he spoke.

Yang Kai said, “Shopkeeper Kang is thoughtful. How is he now?”

Zhou Fu replied, “He’s doing well, and I’ve heard he’ll be returning to Fenglin City soon.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted. “Because of the branch office?”

Zhou Fu said, “Master Yang is well-informed. Yes, it’s because of the branch. Ziyuan Commerce Guild has decided to set up a branch in Fenglin City, and since Shopkeeper Kang has managed here for many years and has extensive connections, he’ll be overseeing things to ensure everything goes smoothly.”

Yang Kai smiled, “Brother Kang’s hardships have finally paid off.”

Previously, Fenglin City wasn’t prominent, so after Kang Siran advanced to the Dao Origin Realm, he was transferred away. But now, with Fenglin City poised to become a major city in just a few years, Ziyuan Commerce Guild bringing Kang Siran back clearly showed their trust in his abilities. He would surely profit greatly and rise in status.

In fact, that was exactly the case. Kang Siran had spent many years here and had close ties with the City Lord’s Mansion and the heads of the major families. If anyone was suited to manage the Fenglin City branch, it was him.

After some small talk, Yang Kai changed the subject. “Shopkeeper Zhou, I came to the Spiritual Pill Shop today to ask for your help.”

Zhou Fu’s face flushed with excitement, and he said solemnly, “If Master Yang has any requests, just say the word. I’ll go through fire and water if needed.”

“Haha, it’s not that serious.” Yang Kai waved his hand with a smile. “I just want to buy something—Formless Profound Grass. Shopkeeper Zhou, you know it, right?”

“Formless Profound Grass?” Zhou Fu raised his eyebrows. “Of course I know it. The Spiritual Pill Shop still has some in stock. If you want it, Master Yang, I’ll give it to you.”

Yang Kai shook his head. “I’m afraid what the shop has in storage isn’t enough.”

Zhou Fu asked, “You need a lot?”

“The more, the better!”

Zhou Fu said, “Then I’ll send people to search the city. I won’t let you down, Master Yang.”

“Thank you, Shopkeeper Zhou.” Yang Kai cupped his fists.

Zhou Fu chuckled and said, “Master Yang, you’re too polite. Back then, it was you who saved the Spiritual Pill Shop—by rights, you’re half a member of our shop yourself. How could I not handle such a small request for you?”
