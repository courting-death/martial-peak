## Chapter 1426 — Extraordinarily Bustling

Now that the Lingxiao Sect could truly be called a sect, everyone present—elders and disciples alike—could not fail to observe proper etiquette upon seeing the Sect Master; even Ye Xijun gave Yang Kai a faint nod.

But she soon shifted her gaze and kept staring at Yang Yan’s movements, a fanatical light flickering in her beautiful eyes.

This woman... really treats Yang Yan like an idol, Yang Kai murmured, curling his mouth slightly.

No wonder—when the name Starry Sky Emperor hangs in the air it inspires terror. Yang Kai could be at ease beside Yang Yan only because they were so familiar with each other.

"What is this for?" Yang Kai gazed into the sky and asked in puzzlement.

"Reporting to the Sect Master: Vice Sect Master Yang intends to open the seal on Flowing Flame Sandland so our sect may behold sun and moon again," Ning Xiangchen replied hurriedly, his tone full of respect; a bright gleam shone in his old eyes, unable to hide his admiration for Yang Yan.

Who in the world could open the seal on Flowing Flame Sandland? Only Yang Yan herself—no wonder Ning Xiangchen looked so reverent.

Hearing this, Yang Kai nodded lightly, understanding Yang Yan’s plan, and did not press further.

Although they had relocated to the ruins of the Taixuan Sect and made it the Lingxiao Sect, the Three Flames Ring still enveloped the place; that crimson barrier obscured the sky so the sun, moon, and stars could not be seen, and living long under such conditions left one feeling somewhat stifled.

So Yang Yan intended to open the flame barrier that blocked the sky and reconnect Lingxiao Sect with the outside world.

That was a good thing, and only Yang Yan could accomplish it. Yang Kai had no objection, so he stood quietly with the others and watched.

Pure Saint Yuan poured from Yang Yan’s delicate form, turning into streams of light that shot toward a point in the sky and vanished in an instant.

As time passed, a faint whirlpool appeared in that scarlet sky; it began small but gradually grew into a vast vortex.

The spinning vortex was a terrifying sight that made one’s flesh crawl, as if it would swallow the entire sky.

After about half an hour, accompanied by a clear shout from Yang Yan, the crimson ring on her wrist hummed, shot into the heavens, unfurled in the wind, and became a colossal ring roughly a dozen li in diameter.

The ring slowly rose into the air until it touched the fiery barrier that covered the sky. It then locked firmly into place, motionless, perfectly encircling the massive vortex within.

Immediately the vortex contracted violently, an unparalleled pulling force issuing forth; with a crisp crack, the flame barrier over Lingxiao Sect burst like a bubble, revealing a patch of sky the same size as the ring—about a dozen li across.

A cheer went up; the disciples leapt with excitement.

Yang Kai grinned, showing his pleasure, but his gaze was soon drawn to something in the sky and his expression turned astonished.

"As expected..." Yang Yan murmured, staring at a point in the heavens; her brows pinched slightly, then with a flick of her hand the first ring of the Three Flames Ring flew back and slipped onto her white wrist.

The flame barrier did not close again, however; it remained an opening roughly a dozen li across, letting sunlight pour through and revealing the blue sky and white clouds outside.

But at this moment, besides the long-missed blue sky and clouds, there was one thing that drew everyone’s attention even more.

A huge, magnificent palace!

The Imperial Garden!

"How could this be here?"

"Wasn’t it over at Dragon Lair Mountain?"

"When did it move here?"

A clamorous chorus of voices rose; dozens of disciples wore anxious looks, like those once bitten by a snake and forever wary of ropes—the last time Dragon Lair Mountain suffered calamity, it was ultimately because the Imperial Garden’s appearance turned Dragon Lair Mountain into the eye of the storm.

They had left Dragon Lair Mountain and found a new foothold far better than before, finally sweeping away earlier gloom and worry, yet unexpectedly—before many days had passed—the Imperial Garden had reappeared directly above them.

They could not accept it.

The venerable Imperial Garden, one of Dark Star’s three great forbidden places, clung to them like an inescapable sticky patch; the more they thought about it, the more unbelievable it seemed.

Moreover, Dragon Lair Mountain was two months’ travel from here; no one knew when the Imperial Garden had arrived above Lingxiao Sect, since Lingxiao Sect had long been shrouded by the Three Flames Ring and could not observe the outside world.

Only Yang Kai and Yang Yan knew the reason; Ye Xijun might have had some suspicions but dared not be certain.

Yang Yan drifted down lightly and stood beside Yang Kai, her expression calm and unreadable.

Glancing at her, Yang Kai asked softly, "Did you know about this already, which is why you broke the barrier?"

"Yes, I had some sensing, though I could not be certain. But whether this occurred or not, the sky’s barrier had to be opened eventually—this was merely fortuitous timing," Yang Yan replied with a light nod.

Yang Kai understood, pondered for a moment, then turned to the disciples and barked, "Quiet—since the Imperial Garden has appeared, it has its reasons. There’s no need to make a fuss; do what needs doing."

His command calmed the commotion; everyone responded with a respectful "Yes" and withdrew.

After the weaker disciples had left, Yang Kai said thoughtfully, "I don’t know when the Imperial Garden shifted, but since it’s here, outside Flowing Flame Sandland must be lively right now!"

The Imperial Garden had played a great prank on the entire Dark Star when it first appeared, hovering above Dragon Lair Mountain and drawing countless powers to Tianyun City.

No one had expected it would migrate.

Now that it hovered above Lingxiao Sect, the strong ones from Dark Star would undoubtedly come; Imperial Jade had already appeared and the day the Imperial Garden opened was near—no one wanted to miss the opportunity.

"Shall we go out and take a look?" Yang Yan asked.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded—knowing his doorstep must be buzzing, he certainly would not stand idly by.

"I’ll go with you," Yang Yan said, unwilling to be left behind.

Yang Kai gave her a look and did not refuse, nodding, "Very well."

After a brief discussion, Yang Yan summoned the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle and the three of them dove inside; Ye Xijun stayed close at Yang Yan’s side and naturally did not lag behind.

Lingxiao Sect was located on the Fourth Stage of Flowing Flame Sandland. Now that the First Stage Heat-Flame Zone had disappeared, the only barrier before Lingxiao Sect was the Third Stage Heat-Flame Zone.

Soon the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle passed through the Fourth Stage and entered the Third Stage Heat-Flame Zone, but with Yang Yan present the roaring heat could not harm the three in the slightest; the flames parted as if animated, opening a channel.

After some time, the shuttle gave a slight shudder and appeared outside the flame barrier.

The hatch opened and Yang Kai strode out; barely steady on his feet, he arched an eyebrow and surveyed the surroundings with a half-smile.

Indeed, a large number of martial artists had gathered outside Flowing Flame Sandland—in small groups or in neat contingents—each anxiously staring at Flowing Flame Sandland.

Yang Kai saw both familiar and unfamiliar faces — friends and foes alike. Practically everyone was here, representing the countless large and small sects across the entire Dark Star.

In short, those who had taken up residence in Tianyun City had all followed the Imperial Garden to this place.

When the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle burst out of Flowing Flame Sandland and Yang Kai made his appearance, every eye turned to him; one by one they gaped, incredulous.

Flowing Flame Sandland, being a forbidden land, was naturally perilous beyond measure.

When it was sealed, no one could trespass; once an Origin Returning Realm expert, overconfident in his strength, tried to force his way in and was melted as soon as he stepped into the First Stage Heat-Flame Zone.

A sealed Flowing Flame Sandland was not something human force could withstand; only during its opening could warriors below Origin Returning Realm use their strength to enter.

Yet now Yang Kai had come out unscathed—did that not mean he had remained inside all along?

How could that be possible?

Many experts thought their eyes deceived them; disbelief mingled with dread and envy. Though they did not know how Yang Kai could freely enter and exit Flowing Flame Sandland, the method was clearly extraordinary.

And the forbidden land contained abundant benefits; if Yang Kai could come and go at will, did that not mean he alone monopolized those treasures?

Those who had grievances with Yang Kai wore faces as dark as water, almost sick with rage.

Even now, with his wings not yet fully grown, Yang Kai was already hard to contend with—if he long held the resources within Flowing Flame Sandland and matured, who on Dark Star could stand against him?

At the thought, many experts exchanged looks and murderous intent sprang up in their hearts.

But not everyone harbored killing intent; the great elder of Yingyue Hall, Qian Tong, and Tianyun City’s lord Fei Zhi Tu looked surprised and delighted. After a moment’s hesitation, Qian Tong called out, "Yang Kai, are the rumors true that you settled here?"

When Dragon Lair Mountain’s people first came here they had driven away a number of martial artists, and Yang Kai had once turned a region of one hundred thousand li around Flowing Flame Sandland into forbidden land—news that had long since spread.

The powerful on Dark Star had heard of it, but none had taken it seriously.

No one believed that Yang Kai and a mere Dragon Lair Mountain could truly settle inside Flowing Flame Sandland; they assumed the youngster was venting his anger over Dragon Lair Mountain’s destruction.

But at this moment they dared not think so—Yang Kai had plainly emerged from Flowing Flame Sandland aboard that strange little warship; seeing was believing, and there could be no doubt.
