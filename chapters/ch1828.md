## Chapter 1828 — Don't Force It

It was a grave matter to occupy someone else's main headquarters without notice; even though the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had remained empty for years, that did not give anyone the right to seize it at will. If Yang Kai pursued the matter, Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai could be killed many times over and still not have enough lives to pay for it.

So once they learned Yang Kai's identity, Lin Yuhao immediately felt the urge to withdraw.

"What are you leaving for? Don't go," Yang Kai chuckled.

Lin Yuhao's face changed and he blurted out in panic, "Saint Lord, Brother Yi and I truly did not know you were still on the Tongxuan Continent; we thought you had already..."

"No need to explain. Hmm, I also have no intention of giving you trouble." Yang Kai waved to cut him off and said calmly, "If you like this place, I'll simply give the Nine Heavens Sacred Land to you."

"Give it to us?" The two of them were stunned; they had no idea what Yang Kai was up to.

"That's right, I'll give it to you," Yang Kai nodded. "But you'll owe me one favor."

Lin Yuhao fell silent for a moment and then asked cautiously, "May I ask what that favor is? Please, Saint Lord, explain it in detail."

"It's nothing, don't be so tense." Yang Kai smiled warmly. "Just keep watch over this place and don't let outsiders wander in. I'll set up an array here; you only need to guard that array in the future."

"That's all?" Yi Zhengkai asked, surprised and uncertain.

"That's all." Yang Kai nodded. "Of course, I won't force you. If you don't wish to, then forget it—I can find others to guard it."

Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai exchanged looks, both finding it hard to make up their minds.

Even though Yang Kai spoke casually, they knew the array would be of utmost importance; if they failed in guarding it, wouldn't they be offending Yang Kai for no reason? From what Yang Kai had shown before, that was a responsibility they could not shoulder.

Their gazes met and their divine senses exchanged for a long while, yet they reached no conclusion.

"Ah, you two don't seem willing—fine, forget it. I'll just find some people outside, even if they're weak it won't matter. I'll hand out some secret treasures and spiritual pills, teach a few techniques sufficient to guard this place." Yang Kai said this and prepared to turn away.

"Wait!" Lin Yuhao shouted, his expression grave. "Saint Lord, please stay. My brother and I have discussed it and made up our minds."

"Oh?" Yang Kai looked back at them.

"Indeed." Yi Zhengkai hurriedly nodded, putting on a smile. "Saint Lord, you once led the three races' experts against the Bone Race to defend the continent; your merits are immense and your name will be remembered for generations. Although our strengths are humble, with Saint Lord's guidance we no longer wish to live in hiding—we want to contribute to this continent's peace."

"We do not know what array you ask us to guard, but if Saint Lord sets it up and it concerns the safety of the continent, my brother and I will not shirk. Please, Saint Lord, entrust it to us!" Lin Yuhao declared resolutely.

"Don't force yourselves." Yang Kai rubbed his forehead. "I dislike forcing people most of all. Guarding an array can be dull; you may have to do it for a long time, perhaps for generations."

"What's difficult about that?" Yi Zhengkai said proudly. "Brother Lin and I never enjoyed crowds; we are solitary by nature. The Sacred Land is picturesque and full of Spiritual Qi—it's precisely the place we've been searching for. To stay here long-term would be the greatest honor; how could it be dull?"

"Brother Yi is right." Lin Yuhao nodded seriously. "This is an important matter. If Saint Lord has no other candidates, please seriously consider the two of us."

"But your powers are a bit low." Yang Kai stroked his chin, appearing picky.

“We’re not that old ourselves,” Lin Yuhao said, gazing eagerly at Yang Kai. “Now that we’ve broken through the Saint Realm, as long as we keep cultivating diligently in this lifetime, we’ll surely grow stronger bit by bit.”

Yang Kai was silent for a long moment, then sighed, "Fine. Since you insist, I, the Saint Lord, will entrust you with this heavy responsibility. Do not take it lightly—guard this place well."

“Rest assured, Saint Lord Yang,” Lin Yuhao said in a deep voice. “As long as my brother and I still draw breath, no outsider will ever set foot in the Sacred Land. Should anyone dare force their way in, even if it costs us our lives, we will stop them!”

"Good, good. Your resolve is admirable; the Sacred Land will be entrusted to you. Please give it your utmost attention."

Upon hearing this, Yi Zhengkai and Lin Yuhao were overjoyed. Yi suddenly put on a different smile and chuckled, "Saint Lord, you mentioned giving secret techniques and spiritual pills—about that..."

"And some cultivation methods... ahem..." Lin Yuhao coughed awkwardly.

"I'll find things suitable for you." Yang Kai said and began rummaging through his Spatial Ring.

His Spatial Ring contained many items—spoils taken after killing enemies—and there was no shortage of things suitable for Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai. Before long he produced several Saint King-Grade secret treasures and numerous spiritual pills, then imparted two cultivation methods suitable for them and a few secret martial techniques.

They had never seen Saint King-Grade treasures or spiritual pills before, and the techniques seemed tailored for them; they were instantly overwhelmed with excitement.

Though they sought a free and carefree life, they were still warriors; every warrior yearned to grow stronger and reach higher in the Martial Dao.

Yang Kai seemed to have opened another door before them.

After their joy, Yi Zhengkai suddenly recalled something and said gravely, "Saint Lord Yang, many troubles have arisen on the Tongxuan Continent this past year; a band of outsiders are wreaking havoc—will Saint Lord take action to wipe them out?"

"You need not worry. Their leader has already been killed; the remaining riffraff will be swept up by my companion. In a few days, the continent will return to peace." Yang Kai said casually.

Hearing him speak so lightly, Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai were utterly shocked.

They did not know how powerful those outsiders were, but judging from the forces that had been exterminated and enslaved, those invaders were not foes the Tongxuan Continent's warriors could easily resist. Yet now, before Yang Kai, they had shown no resistance and would be cleared out in a matter of days.

The two of them gained an indirect sense of Yang Kai's might.

"If you two have just broken through, and you have questions about your current state, speak up and I will explain." Yang Kai did not rush to set the Great Space Array; since he wanted them to guard the place, it was best to strengthen them, so he intended to instruct and help them.

Lin Yuhao's spirit stirred and he asked, "Please enlighten us, Saint Lord. What realm are my brother and I truly at? We feel we've gone beyond the Saint Realm, but we're still confused."

"Yes. The Spiritual Qi on the Tongxuan Continent is sparse; the Saint Realm was long regarded as the highest tier. Your confusion is natural. The realm you two are at now is the Saint King Realm—above the Saint Realm!" Yang Kai explained.

Both of them shuddered at this: above the Saint Realm!

Over the next half day, Yang Kai systematically filled in their knowledge about the Martial Dao's realm divisions and explained matters they needed to attend to during cultivation. They listened and nodded constantly, gaining much benefit.

After half a day, Yang Kai told them to go back and close themselves off to consolidate their current realm, while he began searching for a suitable spot to lay down the Great Space Array.

More than ten days later, the Great Space Array within the Sacred Land had taken shape. Yang Kai made the final adjustments, poured in Saint Yuan, and the array immediately activated, producing a pearly white light and stirring rich Spatial Force.

"It actually connects directly to Qingmu Star!" Yang Kai was greatly surprised. "It seems the Ethereal Crystals from the Lost Realm are indeed extraordinary."

He had not been certain he could link this Great Space Array to the one in the Qingmu Star manor, but after setting it up he found it had indeed worked; the two Great Space Arrays echoed each other and established a mysterious connection through the void.

All of this was thanks to those pure Ethereal Crystals; had they been found elsewhere rather than brought back from the Lost Realm, this might not have been possible.

"Could this really be a Space Array?" the Ghost Ancestor appeared beside Yang Kai like a specter and, staring at the array, clicked his tongue in wonder.

"Yes, it is a Space Array." Yang Kai nodded.

In fact, the Ghost Ancestor had arrived at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land several days earlier but had not disturbed Yang Kai while he was busy; he only showed himself now.

After circling the Space Array a few times, the Ghost Ancestor shook his head, "Truly miraculous. I fear a lifetime of study would not uncover its secrets. No wonder I was trapped on the Floating Continent for two thousand years. Where does this array transmit to?"

"Qingmu Star."

"What?" The Ghost Ancestor was astonished. "You mean... Qingmu Star? The Qingmu Star of the Sword Alliance?"

"Indeed."

"That place is hundreds of millions of li away; a single Space Array alone..."

"One alone wouldn't be enough—there's another Space Array positioned to connect, which is how the transmission is achieved." Yang Kai briefly explained, but the Ghost Ancestor still found it hard to believe.

Even with his cultivation, flying that enormous distance would take almost a year, yet now the two Space Arrays had reduced the gap to zero.

"Elder, how did your recent action go?" Yang Kai asked the Ghost Ancestor.

"All dead." The Ghost Ancestor chuckled. "I even captured an Origin-Grade upper-level warship! The Devouring Spirit Sect's coffers are not bad."

"Is that so? What of the Devouring Spirit Crystals?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

The Ghost Ancestor immediately became wary, "What for? Those are my spoils. Even if you are the Sect Master, you cannot claim them like that."

"Don't make it sound so serious, Elder. The energy in those Devouring Spirit Crystals rightly belongs to this land and should be returned. Come now, hand over the Devouring Spirit Crystals—having them won't do you much good. While they can boost power, they can also destabilize a foundation, and I doubt you'd like to see that happen."
