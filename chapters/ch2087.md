## Chapter 2087 — Black-Eyed Giant Demon

Darkness surrounded them, and something seemed to be lurking quietly within it.

This appeared to be Jiang Chuhe's Sea of Consciousness!

Yang Kai felt a stir in his heart and immediately formed a conjecture.

His situation was strange: although his Divine Sense had been channeled to Qin Yu, allowing her to use a Secret Art to enter Jiang Chuhe's Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai had no control.

Yang Kai could only passively follow Qin Yu's exploratory pace, her will taking the lead as they probed deeper.

The sensation was peculiar and made Yang Kai slightly uncomfortable, but his curiosity prevailed.

Mysterious radiance shot from Qin Yu's Spirit Body, dispelling the surrounding darkness and revealing the churning sea below.

The seawater was pitch-black, like a bottomless black hole, terrifying to behold.

Suddenly, unfamiliar scenes flashed through Yang Kai's mind.

Yang Kai examined them closely and found they were all fragments from Jiang Chuhe's life; the images were intermittent and not continuous, but from them he could glimpse the general arc of Jiang Chuhe's growth.

It seemed Qin Yu had already cast a Soul-Searching Technique on Jiang Chuhe.

The information revealed by those scenes was of little use, so neither Yang Kai nor Qin Yu paid it much heed.

After a long while, another strange scene suddenly appeared before Yang Kai.

It was an extremely arcane formation diagram; within the array, the black patterns writhed like Demon Marks, their lines crisscrossing. The pattern, stamped on a stone wall, writhed and one could faintly hear a maddening low roar as if coming from behind the wall.

That low roar struck Yang Kai's ears and jolted him, making him unsettled.

At the same time, the images imprinted in his mind began to dissipate, as if about to collapse.

Yang Kai was alarmed, realizing Qin Yu had been struck by the shock and was struggling; he hurriedly exerted his own will and, using the channeled Divine Sense as a bridge, awakened Qin Yu's consciousness.

The dissipating images stabilized again.

But the earlier scene had vanished and been replaced by another.

It was a scene of an earth-shattering battle.

A massive creature wrapped in pitch-black Demonic Qi—over thirty zhang in height—loomed, its form terrifying; muscular and towering between heaven and earth, it let out an earthshaking roar.

Its roar shook the surroundings; the clouds in the sky collapsed at a touch and vanished.

As Demonic Qi rolled, the creature's true form became faintly visible.

Its features were hideous and fearsome—one enormous eyeball took up half its face. The vast orb was pitch-black and unfathomable, like a bottomless pit, and from that gigantic eye streaks of inky, ghostly light lashed forth, as if bearing the power to annihilate heaven and earth, splashing into the void and tearing the fabric of space.

The moment Yang Kai's consciousness brushed that single pitch-black eye, he felt excruciating pain in his head; his Sea of Consciousness roiled and nearly ruptured.

Frightened, he hastily looked away.

"Black-Eyed Giant Demon!"

That thought inexplicably rose in his mind, laced with intense panic and dread.

The sensation wasn't Yang Kai's at all but Qin Yu's—her fear and panic. It was Qin Yu who had recognized the giant demon's kind; only because their Divine Senses were linked at that moment did her impressions pass clearly into Yang Kai, allowing him to grasp some of the truth.

At that moment, around the massive Black-Eyed Giant Demon, figures stood; each exuded extremely strong Qi and blood fluctuations, and terrifying power.

These martial artists were all Emperor Realm experts.

By a rough count, there were at least a hundred of them.

Among them, a dozen or so emitted a presence even more terrifying than the Star Envoy Xiao Yuyang from the Star God Palace that Yang Kai had seen before!

It was said Xiao Yuyang had already reached the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, so those dozen who appeared far stronger must be Third Stage of the Emperor Realm!

Each carried the bearing of a sect master, not to be underestimated.

Yet now those hundred Emperor Realm cultivators gathered around the massive Black-Eyed Giant Demon like mosquitoes; Secret Arts and Imperial Treasures flared with dazzling light as they struck the demon.

A wild roar burst from the Black-Eyed Giant Demon's mouth, shaking heaven and earth.

Besides those hundred Emperor Realm figures, more than twenty massive warships hovered around the demon!

Each warship was at least ten zhang long; beams of pure white light shot from them and bombarded the demon.

Heaven and earth changed color; the sun and moon lost their light.

The Black-Eyed Giant Demon seemed somewhat immobile; though it occasionally shifted its body it could not avoid the unending attacks, and after being struck the Demonic Qi on its body churned and it howled in pain.

From its enormous black pupil, inky arcane light constantly lashed out; in its hand it gripped a colossal wolf-tooth club, and with each swing it seemed capable of smashing the very stars from the heavens.

Figures kept falling from the sky; warships kept sparking and breaking in two.

Yang Kai and Qin Yu stared dumbfounded, unable to believe their eyes, their hearts racing for a long time.

The scene abruptly shifted again.

When Yang Kai saw the scene ahead clearly, his eyes narrowed.

Before him the ground was ravaged; the land for ten thousand li around had almost become a wasteland, strewn with the marks of battle.

The Black-Eyed Giant Demon's enormous body lay on the ground, its wolf-tooth club thrown aside, covered in wounds that leaked pitch-black blood; some wounds had flesh peeled back, revealing white bones, chilling to behold.

The Black-Eyed Giant Demon had been killed!

Though he hadn't seen the clash itself, Yang Kai could vividly imagine how grueling the struggle had been.

As far as the eye could see, Emperor Realm experts' corpses lay strewn across the ground. Over a hundred of them had fought here, but fewer than one in five still lived—each badly wounded, faces filled with grief. The more than twenty top‑tier warships had been utterly annihilated, reduced to twisted wrecks that lay across the ancient battlefield, thin wisps of smoke rising from them as if telling of some long‑past sorrow.

The scene shifted again.

The enormous Black‑Eyed Giant Demon's corpse was hurled into the mouth of a ten‑thousand‑year volcano and subjected to the terrifying, earth‑core heat of the Blazing Flame; how long it burned no one knew, but it was not harmed in the slightest.

Experts retrieved the corpse from the crater, gathered the era's powerful figures, inscribed formation arrays, and used their strength to refine it.

Within the profoundly arcane formation, dozens of Emperor Realm experts sat cross‑legged in a ring. The Black‑Eyed Giant Demon's corpse lay at the center, and with each motion of those masters, bolt after bolt of celestial thunder hurled down from the heavens, striking deep into the corpse.

Within the formation pale white flames appeared and burned incessantly.

The corpse finally slowly melted, and in the end only a little remained; one of the experts placed it into a special container, deeply buried it in an abyss ten thousand zhang deep, and set sealing arrays.

Time flowed, seas changed, and whatever the container held slept quietly underground, unknown to the world.

Over time, as the sealing power gradually waned, the Demonic Qi seeped through the vessel and leaked out.

...

In the secret chamber, after an unknown time, Qin Yu suddenly shuddered; her face went pale, she coughed up fresh blood, and she slowly opened her beautiful eyes.

At the same time, Yang Kai opened his eyes, drew a deep breath, and stifled the tumult in his chest.

Seeing Qin Yu unwell, he hurried to her side and pressed a few fingers on her major acupoints, stabilizing her condition.

"Thank you, Sir!" Qin Yu said, but she still couldn't stop trembling.

The two locked eyes and both saw the fear in each other's gaze.

The scenes just witnessed through the Secret Art were clearly what the source of that ancient Demonic Qi had experienced in life; that ancient Demonic Qi had carried the Black-Eyed Giant Demon's will and invaded Jiang Chuhe's body, which allowed Qin Yu and Yang Kai to perceive it.

Though not complete, it was enough to clarify some of the truth.

"This is troublesome," Yang Kai murmured. "We must first report to City Lord Duan."

Just as he reached to take out the Transmission Compass, an angry roar suddenly sounded nearby.

Yang Kai was startled and turned to look at Jiang Chuhe; he saw this man now saturated with surging Demonic Qi, as if trying desperately to break the restraints placed on him; unfortunately, even after being demonized his strength was inadequate, causing the power within him to run amok and he could not control it.

A dangerous aura immediately spread.

"Go!" Yang Kai saw what would happen next. With a low shout, he wrapped Qin Yu in his Origin Qi, shifted his form, and used a spatial Secret Art to vanish from the chamber.

When they reappeared, they were already in the outer courtyard.

Just as they steadied themselves, a tremendous boom came from below; the ground shook, and then a surging force exploded from the earth, carrying fragments of flesh and broken bones.

Pitch-black Demonic Qi transformed into spirit-serpents and slithered about!

The few Qin Family Void King Realm warriors guarding outside the secret chamber never expected this to happen. By the time they reacted it was already too late — the serpent‑like Demonic Qi was about to surge into their bodies when a low shout rang out from nearby: "Condense!"

Space became extraordinarily heavy; even the Qin Family cultivators found it difficult to raise a hand.

The rushing Demonic Qi froze midair at that instant, unable to advance an inch.

Golden Blood Threads flashed and turned into beams of golden light in midair, destroying the Demonic Qi and resolving the crisis.
