## Chapter 2407 — Senior, Spare My Life

Yang Kai looked speechless as he gazed at Jiang Zhouzi, thinking, "When did I ever imply that I looked down on Taiqing Island?" He really had no idea how this man managed to hear that in his words.

However, the group of Dao Origin Realm cultivators behind him immediately became indignant, as if they had suffered a great insult. Each quietly circulated their Origin Qi, looking at Yang Kai and the others with ill intent, seemingly ready to strike.

Yang Kai calmed himself and said, "I didn't mean that. I just think that since things have already happened, there should be a way to resolve them. Island Master Jiang, why not lay out a path for us and we'll follow it!"

Jiang Zhouzi let out a loud laugh, mocking, "Kid, you sure have a big mouth!"

Suddenly, the woman in red stepped forward and whispered a few words into Jiang Zhouzi's ear, glancing repeatedly toward Bing Yun, a hint of playful mockery flickering in her eyes.

Seeing this, Fan Xin and the others all wore grim expressions. Although they didn't know what the woman in red had said to Jiang Zhouzi, just looking at the situation, they could tell it was bad for their Master.

Right now, their Master was at a critical moment in her healing and couldn't be disturbed in the slightest. What did this person intend to do to her?

Thinking of this, Fan Xin and a few Senior Sisters exchanged subtle glances and quietly shifted their positions, blocking Bing Yun from view.

Over there, Jiang Zhouzi snorted coldly and looked at Yang Kai, saying, "You all scared off the congratulatory gift our island was preparing for Wenqing Sect. This is a grave crime, utterly unforgivable!"

He mentioned this Wenqing Sect several times. Although Yang Kai had never heard of it, he was sure this sect held considerable power in the Northern Territory. Otherwise, Taiqing Island wouldn't be so invested in preparing a congratulatory gift for them.

Yang Kai didn't interrupt, simply watching Jiang Zhouzi quietly, waiting for what would come next.

"Now that the gift is gone, since you are willing to compensate, there is room for negotiation!"

Yang Kai replied calmly, "Island Master Jiang, what kind of compensation do you want from us?"

Jiang Zhouzi snorted, pointed, and said, "Leave that young woman behind. The rest of you can get lost."

When he first arrived, he was full of anger and hadn't really noticed Bing Yun's presence. But after the woman in red's reminder, he realized there was an exceptional young woman among them.

In all his years, Jiang Zhouzi had never seen such a pure and flawless woman. Although Bing Yun looked seriously injured and was in the midst of healing, her untainted, celestial aura still shocked him deeply.

Such a pure woman—there might not be another like her in the whole world.

He wanted Bing Yun not for himself, but to give her to the Wenqing Sect. With the Blue Infant Beast gone and the congratulatory gift lost, perhaps this young woman could win the Wenqing Sect's favor instead.

The people of the Wenqing Sect cultivate through emotion, and it's said their techniques grow stronger the deeper their feelings. Every disciple of the Wenqing Sect is surrounded by beautiful women, not to mention the Sect Master.

Giving this young woman to the Wenqing Sect's Sect Master as a gift would surely please him. She was the perfect candidate for deepening his emotions. If the Sect Master was pleased, Taiqing Island wouldn't have to worry about failing to gain their support?

"How dare you!" Fan Xin and several disciples of Ice Heart Valley were nearly driven mad with anger when they heard Jiang Zhouzi say such things about their Master, unable to stop themselves from shouting.

Jiang Zhouzi's face darkened as he said coldly, "What did you say? If you have the guts, say it again!"

Fan Xin gritted her teeth, about to argue further, but Yang Kai stopped her with a wave of his hand. Then, with a leisurely smile, he looked at Jiang Zhouzi and said, "Island Master Jiang, are you sure... you want to keep that young woman?"

Deep down, he found it hilarious. Bing Yun was, after all, a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. Because of her cultivation, she appeared pure and flawless, looking no different from a young girl on the outside. Jiang Zhouzi was truly blind and ignorant, actually thinking he could forcefully keep Bing Yun.

He really didn't know what it meant to court death.

Jiang Zhouzi shot Yang Kai a sidelong glance, his patience clearly worn thin. With a cold, commanding voice brimming with murderous intent, he barked, "Everyone except that young woman—get out of my sight! You have ten breaths to leave. If you’re still here after that, none of you will be leaving at all!"

"Fine, fine, we're leaving!" Yang Kai waved his hand decisively, preparing to leave with the others.

"Coward!" The woman in red from Taiqing Island glanced at Yang Kai with contempt, her face full of ridicule. In her eyes, Yang Kai was a coward for so easily abandoning his companion for his own safety. Even though it was her idea to leave Bing Yun as compensation, it didn't stop her from despising Yang Kai's character.

The remaining Taiqing Island martial artists didn't say anything, but their faces were also full of mockery.

"Pillmaster Yang!" Fan Xin stomped her foot, looking at Yang Kai with anger and disappointment. She hadn't expected him to abandon their Master so easily. Couldn't he see that their Master was still healing?

"Don't worry." Yang Kai winked at her, looking completely confident.

Seeing this, Fan Xin couldn't say more. She just glanced worriedly at Bing Yun before retreating to the side with Yang Kai and the others.

Jiang Zhouzi, unable to wait any longer, rushed forward and reached out to grab Bing Yun, clearly intending to subdue her and take her back to Taiqing Island.

Looking at Bing Yun's serene face, he couldn't help but marvel. How could there be such a pure woman in this world? Even someone like him, who had never cared for women, couldn't help but feel moved, wanting to take her back and cherish her.

He could already imagine a happy life together with Bing Yun in the future.

No, no, such a perfect young woman couldn't be given to Wenqing Sect's Sect Master. He had to keep her for himself! Greed surged in his heart, and he became extremely agitated.

Just then, Bing Yun, who had been healing with her eyes closed, suddenly opened her beautiful eyes.

Zzz—

Seeing those beautiful eyes, Jiang Zhouzi felt as if his heart had been struck by an invisible hammer, unable to look away.

What pure eyes! Jiang Zhouzi even saw his own stunned reflection in them. Those eyes were like a clear spring, a full moon—impossible to forget, as if branded into his soul.

Jiang Zhouzi became even more determined to keep this young woman for himself. In all his years of cultivation, he had never been so moved by a woman at first sight.

"Don't move, this Lord won't hurt you!" Jiang Zhouzi tried to make his voice gentle, afraid of scaring the young woman. As he spoke, his large hand was about to grab Bing Yun's shoulder.

At that moment, Bing Yun gently raised a jade-like hand and lightly tapped Jiang Zhouzi's palm.

Her movement was extremely gentle, without the slightest hint of aggression.

Jiang Zhouzi was momentarily dazed, but then his expression changed dramatically.

The instant Bing Yun moved, he sensed an incredibly terrifying power emanating from her.

This young woman... was actually a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert!

Earlier, when he saw Yang Kai and the others, their cultivations varied, with the strongest only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Bing Yun was also healing, so he hadn't paid much attention, assuming her cultivation was similar to theirs and not giving it much thought.

But now, realizing that Bing Yun's strength was far beyond his reach, he finally understood what a colossal mistake he had made.

He really was blind—how could he have thought to keep such a powerful expert? If he'd known Bing Yun was this terrifying, he wouldn't have dared be so rude.

Even the Island Master of Taiqing Island was only at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. No one on the entire island could match this young woman's strength.

Shocked, he tried to retreat, but an invisible force bound him in place, leaving him unable to move.

Bing Yun's movement seemed slow and gentle, but in a flash, her finger tapped Jiang Zhouzi's large hand.

"Senior, spare my life!" Jiang Zhouzi cried out in terror, his face instantly turning pale.

As soon as he finished speaking, he felt a slight pain in his palm, as if pricked by a needle. Then, a strange chill suddenly spread from his palm.

His eyes widened in horror, and his heart sank.

A pure white ice flower suddenly bloomed in his palm. The ice flower was exquisite, sculpted from jade, flawless—the most beautiful sight in the world, mesmerizing to behold.

But Jiang Zhouzi had no mind to admire it. As the ice flower appeared, his arm was instantly encased in ice, spreading rapidly upward. Wherever the ice passed, his arm lost all feeling, and the chill seemed to freeze even his Divine Soul.

Seeing the ice about to reach his chest, Jiang Zhouzi bit his tongue, formed a knife with his fingers, and slashed down hard on his shoulder.

Splurt—

Blood spurted, and his arm was severed. Only then did Jiang Zhouzi feel the force binding him disappear. Terrified, he quickly retreated, putting distance between himself and Bing Yun.

Once he steadied himself, cold sweat drenched his forehead, and his face was as pale as paper. He hurriedly took out some Healing Pills from his Spatial Ring and swallowed them, looking at Bing Yun in fear and dread.

With the strength Bing Yun had just displayed, if she truly wanted to kill him, he would have no way to resist!

Now, he could only pray that Bing Yun was not a bloodthirsty person and would spare his life since he had already suffered enough.

On the other side, the group of Dao Origin Realm cultivators from Taiqing Island were all dumbfounded.

All they saw was Jiang Zhouzi charging at Bing Yun, then Bing Yun raising her hand, and Jiang Zhouzi retreating in a panic, severing his own arm.
