## Chapter 674 — Is There a Backer Behind Him?

If a Spirit-Grade Pill bore Pill Patterns, its value would at least double. Even a top-tier Spirit-Grade Upper-Level alchemist could only occasionally refine one or two Pills that developed Pill Patterns—and that required extraordinarily good luck and perfect condition.

As for the legendary Pill Cloud, even he had never seen one.

The bearded man pinched that Pill between his fingers and fell silent for a long while.

An hour later, Yang Kai finished refining.

With five sets of materials, four Spirit-Grade Pills were produced in total; the final set failed during refinement—Yang Kai had done that on purpose.

At that moment both the bearded man and the woman stared at Yang Kai dumbfounded, looking at him as if he were a celestial being.

"Master, does this guy have some secret to preserving his looks? Why does he look only twenty?" the woman asked.

"No, that should be his true age. Incredible—how can he be so powerful?" Saying this, he cast a long look at the woman, his expression full of disappointed reproach.

"Master, could you not look at me like that? I've been trying very hard." Mi Na felt aggrieved.

Her alchemical aptitude was likewise outstanding; she was well known across several thousand li, and several nearby powers sought to recruit her as a guest alchemist. Because of that aptitude Mi Na had always held herself in high regard, but her pride crumbled at the sight of these four Spirit-Grade Pills.

The master and disciple whispered among themselves for a while. Yang Kai didn't try to eavesdrop; after waiting a moment he asked, "Did I pass the test?"

The bearded man was taken aback, then chuckled, his smile open and genial. He nodded, "Passed. Absolutely passed."

"Then my jade token…?"

"Don't worry, the jade token will definitely be given to you, but before that you need to meet someone. Wait a moment, I'll call him!" Saying that, the bearded man dashed out.

The room was left with only Yang Kai and the woman.

Yang Kai was speechless.

"You really are someone to be reckoned with," the woman said with genuine admiration, openly extending a hand, no longer showing her earlier contempt. "Let me properly introduce myself: I am Mi Na, a Mystery-Grade Upper-Level alchemist and a member of this alchemist division."

"Yang Kai." Yang Kai chuckled and shook her hand lightly.

"Where did you come from?" Mi Na asked curiously.

"From the west, I suppose."

Mi Na examined him, pursed her lips in a smile and said, "Never mind, I won't ask. You look too guarded."

To the west lay boundless snow mountains; Yang Kai's claim that he came from there was clearly a perfunctory answer.

"By the way, why did you change the configuration of the five sets of materials earlier?"

"Wasn't that your test?" Yang Kai replied in surprise.

Mi Na slowly shook her head. "That was the configuration I thought best, but after you altered it, it seemed much easier to refine. Who taught you to do it that way?"

"Instinct…" Yang Kai felt a pang of awkwardness. He hadn't thought much of it at the time, assuming they had deliberately mixed the materials wrong to test his foundation—turns out that wasn't the case.

"Why would you do that? My master's prescription isn't like that. Could my master's formula be wrong?" Mi Na frowned.

Yang Kai considered for a moment, then explained without holding anything back. Mi Na listened with bright eyes, nodding over and over, clearly feeling she had gained much.

The two discussed the correctness and rigor of the prescription inside the room. Outside, the bearded man and another man stopped to listen; the more they heard, the more astonished their expressions became.

They themselves had never thought to alter that prescription, yet after the change it proved far more effective than the original.

At the very least, if one used Yang Kai's method to refine, it would avoid many unnecessary failures, increase the chances and quality of successful Pills, and better extract the medicinal potency from the ingredients.

"Where did you find this boy?" the man asked the bearded man.

"He delivered himself," the bearded man shrugged. "Looks like we've found a treasure, right?"

The other man gave a noncommittal response, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.

Hearing the door, Yang Kai turned to look and saw the bearded man and an elder with the bearing of an immortal enter together.

Mi Na hurriedly introduced them. "This is Du Wan; Du Wan is in charge here and is a Saint-Grade Lower-Level alchemist."

Yang Kai couldn't help but become respectful and immediately bowed.

Du Wan smiled and nodded. "Young friend, there's no need for ceremony. From now on we're one family."

"This is someone you've already met—my master, a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level alchemist."

Ye Xiong grinned broadly at Yang Kai.

"Sit down," Du Wan gestured.

After everyone sat, Mi Na produced a few cups of fragrant tea from somewhere and offered them. Du Wan sipped, then smiled, "I understand your purpose. Being able to refine Spirit-Grade Pills indeed qualifies you to have your own jade token. I will present the token that represents an alchemist's status shortly."

"Thank you." Yang Kai nodded.

"May I ask where your training came from, young friend?" Du Wan inquired.

As he asked, Du Wan looked at Yang Kai with burning eyes.

Having heard Ye Xiong's earlier report, Du Wan had a vague sense that this young man was not ordinary; after listening at the door to many of his unique insights, Du Wan immediately recognized Yang Kai's uncommon nature.

Those insights were things even he could not fully fathom—how could such an inexperienced youth have understood them?

The only possibility was that someone was guiding him from behind the scenes.

Du Wan was eager to know which high master could have taught such a disciple.

Young in age, his cultivation already at the peak of Divine Roaming, and possessing the standard of a Spirit-Grade alchemist—such a backer would be tremendous, perhaps a world-shaking figure.

Although Du Wan was a respected Saint-Grade alchemist, there were still alchemists above him, not to mention those reclusive monsters who hid for years in deep mountains and forests. Those old beasts might not appear once in decades or centuries, yet each possessed transcendent means and unfathomable divine arts.

Moreover, these formidable elders were fiercely protective of their own. It was highly possible that one of their heirs would leave seclusion to gain worldly experience; such heirs often blossomed into wonders within a few short years and soon became famed across the continent.

The young man before them, called Yang Kai, was therefore highly suspicious.

He possessed the standard of a Spirit-Grade alchemist but did not appear in the Alchemists' Association records and didn't even have a jade token—clear signs that he had only recently come out of some remote mountain wilderness.

Du Wan looked at Yang Kai as if he perceived a colossal presence hidden behind him; he could not help but be cautious and naturally wanted to learn Yang Kai's true identity.

Ye Xiong and Mi Na also looked at him with shining eyes, clearly very interested in the topic.

"Master?" Yang Kai smiled wryly and shook his head. "I have no master; no one has taught me."

"No master, huh… hehe." Du Wan smiled faintly, unconcerned. If it were really so easy to uncover the backer behind him, that would be the strange thing. Yang Kai's claim only made Du Wan all the more certain that the youth's origin was extraordinary.

But such an obvious attempt to hide the truth—like burying silver to prove there is none—was far too naive.

Young people, indeed, did not know how to conceal themselves.

Such mysteriously-originating disciples never advertised their sects or affiliations while roaming the world. But if one befriended such a person, one might gain contact with their sect and thus obtain great benefits.

A hundred years ago, a not-very-powerful force befriended such a wandering disciple. Ten years later, that force offended another and suffered a mad campaign of retaliation with heavy casualties; yet overnight that enemy force was utterly annihilated from Tongxuan Continent.

As a Saint-Grade alchemist, Du Wan would not have people making trouble for him nor would he pick fights; he had no intention of relying on others' power. What he coveted was the alchemical method of whoever had taught Yang Kai—whoever could produce a disciple like him must be a top-tier alchemist.

Du Wan had been stuck at Saint-Grade Lower-Level for many years; if he could meet a high master now for guidance, he might possibly break through to Saint-Grade Middle-Level.

"Where do you intend to take up residence, young friend?" Du Wan asked kindly.

"I don't know either; I'll stay in Giant Stone City for a while," Yang Kai shook his head. "I just came out from a very remote place and the world here is unfamiliar. Don't laugh, Du Wan, but I haven't even heard the names of many of the local powers, and this is the first time I've heard of the Alchemists' Association."

Du Wan's seemingly murky eyes brightened, revealing a glint of sharp light. He smiled and nodded, "Very well. No matter—so long as you remain in Giant Stone City you can come ask this old man at any time. If there's anything you don't understand, I can answer it."

Yang Kai's expression was odd; he didn't understand why this Saint-Grade alchemist treated him so kindly.

"Du Wan, could he live inside the Alchemists' Association?" Mi Na suddenly suggested.

Du Wan smiled, "That depends on whether young friend has that intention."

"I can live here?" Yang Kai was astonished.

Mi Na explained, "As long as you are an alchemist, you can live here. The entire Alchemists' Association basically only has the three of us as permanent residents; the others have attached themselves to nearby powers. Occasionally other alchemists from elsewhere stop by to rest. So it's relatively quiet here. If you have nowhere to go, you can stay here. Living here, we can spar over alchemy techniques, which will benefit everyone. How about it?"

Mi Na clearly wanted Yang Kai to stay; after their earlier conversation she had gained much and naturally wished to continue exchanging ideas with him.

"Then I'll trouble you all for a bit." Unable to refuse such warm hospitality and seeing Mi Na's expectant face, Yang Kai felt awkward refusing; besides, Du Wan and Ye Xiong had shown no malice.

"You're too polite, young friend," Du Wan smiled.

"But I probably won't stay long before I have to leave," Yang Kai added.

"Everything as you wish," Du Wan said, reaching out to take a jade token and pushing it over. "This is the identity token of my Alchemists' Association. With this, you can enjoy privileges at any shop run by the association, and if you encounter danger, presenting this jade token will, in most cases, turn peril into safety."

"Thank you, Du Wan." Yang Kai took the jade token, poured in some True Yuan to sense it, his face brightening. The token concealed a mysterious energy that made it easy for anyone who sensed it to discern the level of the token's owner's alchemist.
