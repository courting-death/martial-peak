## Chapter 2122 — Shattered

This time, Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang hadn’t gone far before they sensed a Dao Origin Realm expert approaching.

It was likely the helper the two Qingyang Shrine disciples had called for earlier.

The newcomers arrived extremely fast, and there were several—at least four or five. The leader was a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm expert.

Yang Kai waited quietly and stopped moving forward. Qin Chaoyang also halted, his expression uneasy and anxious.

Soon, a flash of light appeared, and a group of martial artists stood before the two.

“Deacon Tao, these are the two who trespassed into our Qingyang Mountain Range and spoke outrageously. My Senior Brother and I couldn’t defeat them and had to retreat in shame. Look, that man is even holding my Senior Brother’s longsword!”

The chubby Junior Brother and the blue-faced Senior Brother from before were among the group. As soon as they appeared, the chubby Junior Brother gestured animatedly at a middle-aged man, pointing at Yang Kai.

The middle-aged man looked about fifty, with half-white hair and a not-so-tall frame, but his eyes shone sharply, giving off a capable air.

This must be the Deacon the chubby Junior Brother had mentioned.

A Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator only held the rank of Deacon in Qingyang Shrine. The higher positions of Protector and Elder were held by still more powerful martial artists.

Yang Kai pondered silently.

As soon as the chubby Junior Brother finished speaking, the blue-faced Senior Brother shouted, “Hey, bumpkin! Hand over my Secret Treasure, or you’ll regret it!”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched at his words.

He had never intended to keep the other’s Secret Treasure for himself. The longsword was just a Void King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure, and he only held it to return it when he saw the blue-faced man again.

But now, with those words, he was caught in a dilemma—returning it seemed cowardly, not returning it was a provocation.

If he handed it over he would look weak; if not, it was an obvious provocation. Yang Kai felt secretly furious, wishing he could tear the blue-faced man's mouth apart.

"Enough! No rudeness!" Fortunately, Deacon Tao seemed reasonable and did not blindly believe his own shrine's disciples. He likely knew the chubby Junior Brother and the blue-faced Senior Brother well, and was aware of their tendencies.

As he spoke, he glanced at Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang, instantly understanding the situation.

Two cultivators at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—while their cultivation was not high, it was not low either. Compared to ordinary cultivators, a Dao Origin Realm practitioner could at least be considered an expert.

“I’ve more or less understood what happened. Do you two have anything to say?” Deacon Tao asked.

Qin Chaoyang quickly cupped his fists, “I am Qin Chaoyang, head of the Qin Family in Fenglin City. Greetings, Deacon Tao. Yang Brother and I came to Qingyang Shrine not to cause trouble, but your two disciples suddenly attacked us, leaving us no choice but to defend ourselves. I ask Deacon Tao to judge fairly!”

“Fenglin City…” Deacon Tao’s brows furrowed slightly. “Lately, I’ve heard the name Fenglin City quite often…”

The two other Dao Origin Realm martial artists beside him nodded gently.

First, the Divine Spirit Luanfeng appeared near Fenglin City’s Yuqing Mountain, then the seal of the Ancient Giant Demon broke, demonic qi surrounded the city, and so on…

These matters weren’t secret; anyone interested could find out.

“Has something happened in Fenglin City again?” Deacon Tao asked in surprise, thinking Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang were messengers seeking help.

Hearing this, Qin Chaoyang immediately understood—the other party didn’t know their purpose, likely because the chubby Junior Brother and blue-faced Senior Brother hadn’t explained.

Qin Chaoyang said, “It’s not that something happened in Fenglin City. I, Qin, came for personal matters.”

“Personal matters?” Deacon Tao frowned, “Do you have old ties with someone in Qingyang Shrine?”

“No,” Qin Chaoyang shook his head.

“Then are you here to join Qingyang Shrine?” Deacon Tao asked again.

“Also no!”

Deacon Tao grew impatient. At that moment, the chubby Junior Brother leaned in and whispered something in his ear.

Deacon Tao’s eyes flashed coldly. He stared at the two, nodding, “So that’s it. Such arrogant words—it’s no wonder they attacked you.”

After a brief pause, he said, “Seeing that reaching the Dao Origin Realm is no easy feat and this is your first offense, each of you leave one arm behind and be on your way.”

Qin Chaoyang’s body trembled, his eyes wide with disbelief.

Yang Kai’s brows furrowed, feeling the situation was troublesome. Though Deacon Tao was reasonable, his methods were direct, giving them no chance to explain.

Seeing their expressions, Deacon Tao chuckled, “What? Reluctant? If you can’t do it, I don’t mind helping!”

“Deacon Tao!” Yang Kai suddenly shouted.

“Do you have something to say?” Deacon Tao looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled, “So just because Old Brother Qin and I want to meet your Hall Master, you want us to cut off an arm? Is this how Qingyang Shrine treats guests? The Southern Territory’s top Sect—truly, seeing is believing!”

His mocking tone made the others glare angrily.

Deacon Tao sneered, “You trespassed into our Qingyang Mountain Range. I could take your lives, but I’m letting you go. You should be grateful to leave with an arm. Say another word and you won’t leave at all.”

He looked completely confident.

It was no surprise—he was Second Stage Dao Origin Realm, while Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang were First Stage. Deacon Tao didn’t see them as threats, especially with two First Stage companions at his side.

Yang Kai asked, “Just because of our request?”

“Yes!”

“Now that is strange. Do your Sect's rules forbid outsiders from requesting an audience with Hall Master Wen?”

“Of course not, but… what right do you have to see the Hall Master?”

Qingyang Shrine’s Hall Master, Wen Zishan, was a true Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, standing at the peak of the Martial Dao. Not just anyone could meet him. To see him, you’d need to be at least Emperor Realm. For Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang, two First Stage Dao Origin Realm martial artists, to make such a request was simply… intolerable!

It was like a ragged beggar asking to see a nation’s noble princess. The guards would rather kill the beggar than let him sully the princess’s eyes.

“Since Old Brother Qin and I traveled thousands of miles to come here, we naturally have a reason to see Hall Master Wen,” Yang Kai said seriously. “How about this, Deacon Tao, you report this to Hall Master Wen. Whether he sees us or not is up to him.”

“Insolent! The Hall Master is busy day and night. Why would he see nobodies like you?” Deacon Tao snorted.

Yang Kai looked at him with interest, “Deacon Tao, could it be you can’t see Hall Master Wen either?”

Without waiting for a denial, Yang Kai acted as if he’d realized something, muttering, “I see. With Deacon Tao’s status, it’s not easy to meet Hall Master Wen. How about this—Deacon Tao, report to an Elder or Protector you can reach, and have them pass it on to Hall Master Wen?”

“I don’t need you to tell me how to do my job!” Deacon Tao seemed a bit embarrassed, clearly hit by Yang Kai’s words.

Yang Kai remained unmoved and said coolly, “Deacon Tao, Old Brother Qin and I did not come here without cause. We have our reasons to seek Hall Master Wen — and something that ensures he will want to meet us himself. Are you certain you intend to drive us out of the Qingyang Mountain Range?”

Deacon Tao’s eyes narrowed at these words.

Yang Kai’s composure unsettled him—far too steady for a First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, as if he genuinely believed the Hall Master would grant them an audience.

If they truly brought important information for Hall Master Wen, but he drove them away, and the Hall Master found out later, he wouldn’t escape blame…

Thinking this, Deacon Tao suppressed his annoyance and asked, “What makes you so sure the Hall Master must see you? Tell me, and if it’s true, I’ll report it.”

Yang Kai glanced at Qin Chaoyang.

Qin Chaoyang knew it was time to show something, or they wouldn’t even get through Qingyang Shrine’s gate.

He reached into his Spatial Ring and took out the Jade Maiden Beggar Token, infused it with a trace of power, and tossed it to Deacon Tao, “Deacon, just pass this to Hall Master Wen. He’ll understand.”

As he spoke, Qin Chaoyang remained calm, but inside he was praying that the expert he met years ago wasn’t joking. If the Jade Maiden Beggar Token didn’t work, he and Yang Kai would be doomed today.

“What’s this?” Deacon Tao took the token and examined it closely.

The other two Dao Origin Realm experts also leaned in to look.

Deacon Tao's face changed in an instant: suspicion gave way to bafflement, then shock, then wrath. He snapped, “Impudent knaves! Did you think a crudely carved, senseless token could deceive this Deacon? You must be dreaming!”

Deacon Tao’s reaction was exactly what Yang Kai expected.

Anyone seeing the token would be suspicious. When Yang Kai first saw the Jade Maiden Beggar Token, he didn’t think much of it either, but after testing it himself, he realized it was made by a true expert—one far beyond his imagination.

Such an expert wouldn’t toy with Qin Chaoyang, a Dao Origin Realm martial artist; Yang Kai believed the token was genuine — a symbol of status and identity!

So he confidently smiled, “Deacon Tao, the token may look odd, but it wasn’t carved at random. It was made by a top expert. You may not understand, but I’m sure Hall Master Wen will!”

“Fine! You two bastards really think I’m easy to talk to? Let’s see if you’re still so cocky after I chop off your limbs and scalp you!” Deacon Tao’s face twisted with rage. As he spoke, he gripped the token tightly.

A shocking scene unfolded.

“Crack…”

The token shattered!
