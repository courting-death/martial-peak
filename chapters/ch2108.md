## Chapter 2108 — Visiting Together

"I never agreed to join forces with you, so how can you call me a traitor?" the Incarnation looked at Hua Qingsi with an innocent expression.

"I don't care!" Hua Qingsi turned her head away from the Incarnation and spat out rapidly, "Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor..."

"Stop making such a fuss!" Yang Kai snorted coldly and said, "Tell me, what secret is Han Leng hiding?"

"I don't know!" Hua Qingsi answered crisply.

"Heh heh..." Yang Kai grinned and said lightly, "It seems you still haven't realized just how awkward your current situation is... Since that's the case, we'll talk again when you've cleared your head!"

With that, he waved his hand.

Hua Qingsi, who had been suspended in midair, suddenly vanished without a trace. No one knew where in the Small Xuan Realm Yang Kai had thrown her.

Immediately after, Yang Kai formed a series of seals with his hands, sending several techniques into the air, seemingly casting a secret art on Hua Qingsi.

"This woman may be lacking in intelligence, but she's not a bad person," the Incarnation suddenly said.

"I know." Yang Kai nodded. "If she hadn't truly wanted to save me, I wouldn't have sent her in here. I would have killed her to silence her long ago."

"As long as you know what you're doing." After saying this, Incarnation glanced at Yang Kai's body and said, "You'd better tend to your injuries quickly."

Yang Kai nodded and sat cross-legged beside the medicine garden.

In the previous battle, he had been entangled by demonic thoughts and fought fearlessly, ending up in a fierce battle with three Emperor Realm masters, suffering multiple injuries.

The wounds were wrapped in the Law Power of the three Emperor Realm masters, making them hard to heal.

If an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator suffered such injuries, aside from taking some Spiritual Pills to prevent the wounds from worsening, there would be no other solution.

But within the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai could use the world principles of this space to expel the lingering Law Power from his wounds.

Three days passed in a flash, and Yang Kai finally finished tending to his injuries.

With the help of the astonishing vitality emitted by the Everlasting Tree in the medicine garden, and his own powerful recovery ability, Yang Kai's wounds were now almost completely healed, with no visible traces left. Only the inevitable weakness after a great battle remained. He would need to rest for a few days to fully recover.

He left the Small Xuan Realm and appeared in a guest room of the Zhang Family.

Liu Yan had been guarding the Xuan Realm Pearl the whole time. When she saw Yang Kai appear, her beautiful eyes lit up and she exclaimed with joy, "Master..."

As she spoke, she looked Yang Kai up and down, confirming he was unharmed, and finally let out a clear sigh of relief.

"Thank you for your hard work," Yang Kai nodded to her and reached out to put away the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Liu Yan said, "It was my duty."

"Very good, you've also advanced to the Dao Origin Realm. Congratulations."

Previously, Liu Yan had been slumbering in the magma beneath Primordial Cauldron Mountain, absorbing its scorching fire. Yang Kai had already sensed she was about to break through, but after waiting a month with no movement, he had no choice but to set out for Fenglin City.

Fortunately, Liu Yan returned at the critical moment. Using the unbreakable spiritual connection between them, she awakened Yang Kai's consciousness. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

"I'm only a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, still far behind Master," Liu Yan said with a slight smile.

"Don't belittle yourself. You're different from ordinary living beings; though you lack natural advantages, heaven has let you take this step so you will go even farther."

"I hope so..." Liu Yan also showed a look of longing.

"By the way, see if this is useful to you," Yang Kai suddenly remembered and took something out of his Spatial Ring.

As soon as the item appeared, the temperature in the whole room soared, and an aura capable of burning all things spread out!

"This is..." Liu Yan's beautiful eyes narrowed as she stared in shock at the item in Yang Kai's hand.

It was a feather, three feet long, entirely golden, but on its surface, pitch-black flames seemed to burn, flickering like spirits... At a glance, those flames looked as if they could incinerate even the soul.

"A Luan Feng feather," Yang Kai explained.

This Luan Feng feather was something he had picked up in Yuqing Mountain. It was not a feather shed by a young Luan Feng, but a divine feather from an adult Divine Spirit.

Such things were always priceless treasures, more than worthy of forging the finest Secret Treasures, but Yang Kai felt giving it to Liu Yan was the best choice.

Sure enough, as soon as Yang Kai spoke, Liu Yan's delicate body trembled, and she stared fixedly at the Luan Feng feather, her beautiful eyes quivering as she said hoarsely, "I can try to refine it!"

"All the better!" Yang Kai smiled and handed the feather over.

Liu Yan took it and began to play with it, unable to put it down.

Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately put her into the Xuan Realm Pearl, letting her refine it on her own.

Afterwards, Yang Kai left the room and met with the Zhang Family members.

As soon as they saw Yang Kai, the Zhang Family members naturally expressed their concern, especially Zhang Ruoxi. Although she was too shy to say a word, Yang Kai could feel her care and relief from the glances she occasionally cast his way.

After chatting casually with the Zhang Family for a while, Yang Kai returned to his room, took out a Sound Bead, and sent a message to Mo Xiaoqi to let her know he was safe.

Xiaoqi was overjoyed and immediately said she wanted to visit Yang Kai. Before he could stop her, she cut off the connection, leaving him with no choice but to smile wryly.

Not long after, Yang Kai sensed several powerful auras approaching from afar. Before the people arrived, a voice rang out from the distance: "Haha, Brother Yang, we've come to visit you!"

The voice echoed in all directions, full of vigor.

When the Zhang Family members heard who it was, chaos broke out. Led by the matriarch, they all went outside to line up and welcome the guests.

Soon, a flash of light revealed several figures.

The Zhang Family matriarch bowed slightly and said loudly, "With the City Lord gracing our humble abode, the Zhang Family is honored beyond words. I apologize for not welcoming you sooner—please forgive me!"

The others also greeted Duan Yuanshan.

Duan Yuanshan waved his hand and smiled, "No need for such formalities, Madam. As the City Lord, I came uninvited, so please forgive me. I came to see Brother Yang—may I ask if he is..."

"Lord Yang is resting in the guest room. Please, come in!" Although the matriarch's voice was steady, anyone could see her barely contained excitement and joy.

Normally, a small family like the Zhangs would never attract the attention of the City Lord, let alone have him come personally from Fenglin City. But now, this impossible thing had become reality.

Though they knew it was all thanks to Yang Kai, it was still a great honor for the Zhang Family.

The Zhang Family now consisted only of widows and orphans, making them easy targets for other families. But if today's events spread, those with designs on the Zhangs might not dare to act.

In fact, they might even have to rely on the Zhang Family!

The matriarch saw hope for the Zhang Family's rise and felt even more grateful to Yang Kai from the bottom of her heart.

"Sorry to trouble you," Duan Yuanshan smiled slightly and was about to land with the other two when one of them, unable to wait, turned into a stream of light and shot straight into the Zhang Family's main house, disappearing in front of a guest room.

"So impatient!" Duan Yuanshan could only smile wryly at this, but said nothing more.

In the guest room, Kang Siran pushed the door open and saw Yang Kai looking at him with a smile.

"Brother Yang, are you... all right?" Kang Siran nervously examined Yang Kai's condition. Once he was sure Yang Kai was fine, he finally let out a clear sigh of relief. "The City Lord and the others said you were almost corrupted by Demonic Qi outside the city and nearly became a demon. It scared me to death."

"That's true, but fortunately, I managed to turn danger into safety in the end." Yang Kai nodded with a smile.

Kang Siran said with shame, "I was in seclusion, trying to break through, and knew nothing of this. I only heard about it the day before yesterday after I came out, but by then you had vanished. The City Lord and I searched everywhere, but still couldn't find you. I truly, truly feel I've let you down, Brother Yang."

Kang Siran's expression was genuine, and his words came from the heart.

After all, if not for Yang Kai giving him a Dao Origin Pill, he could never have become a Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

Moreover, Kang Siran could vaguely sense that the Dao Origin Pill with Pill Patterns had brought him not just a breakthrough in realm, but other changes as well.

He couldn't say exactly what those changes were, but he always felt that the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was not the end of his Martial Dao, and that he still had hope of advancing further—perhaps even glimpsing the mysteries of the Emperor Realm!

This was a kindness equal to being reborn, so great that Kang Siran felt he could never repay it in this lifetime.

Yang Kai had shown him immense favor, but when Yang Kai was in danger, he knew nothing about it. This made Kang Siran feel deeply guilty.

Now, seeing Yang Kai safe, he finally felt a bit better.

Yang Kai said solemnly, "Thank you for your concern, Brother Kang."

"Don't say that..." Kang Siran scratched his cheek.

"Shopkeeper Kang and Brother Yang are very close, aren't they?" a voice called out as Duan Yuanshan strode in, followed by Mo Xiaoqi.

When she saw Yang Kai, Mo Xiaoqi's eyes lit up. Embarrassed, she stuck out her tongue and said, "I wanted to come alone, but when City Lord Duan and Shopkeeper Kang heard you were back, they insisted on coming too..."

"It's not Miss Xiaoqi's fault. I truly came uninvited. I hope I haven't disturbed your rest, Brother Yang?" Duan Yuanshan said with a laugh.

"You're too polite, City Lord Duan." Yang Kai smiled calmly and nodded to Mo Xiaoqi. "The room is simple, please make yourselves comfortable."

Duan Yuanshan didn't stand on ceremony and found a chair to sit down. Mo Xiaoqi and Kang Siran followed suit.

Once seated, Duan Yuanshan's expression turned serious. "Brother Yang, I must first apologize to you."

"What do you mean, City Lord?" Yang Kai asked, feigning ignorance.

Duan Yuanshan said, "When Zhuang Pan escaped and the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation collapsed, you were invaded by Demonic Qi. I failed to help you, and every time I think of it, I feel uneasy."

Yang Kai shook his head. "You're being too hard on yourself, City Lord. I know exactly what happened then—it wasn't your fault."

Hearing this, Duan Yuanshan finally smiled. "Brother Yang, you truly are a reasonable man."

"Hmph, just a coward clinging to life!" Kang Siran snapped indignantly.
