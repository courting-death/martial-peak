## Chapter 712 — It Turns Out to Be Him

Under the protection of Cang Yan and the others, Yang Kai pressed forward through that chaotic battlefield with consummate ease.

A team of four experts of the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm was also a formidable force; those around seemed to realize that Cang Yan and his companions were not to be trifled with, and naturally would not provoke them without cause.

Screams rose in an endless succession; in such a large-scale melee some were bound to be wounded or killed, blood and severed limbs flying about — a most miserable sight.

The distance of dozens of li was covered in no more than the time it takes half an incense stick.

Some had already arrived at the foot of the peak ahead of them; when Yang Kai and the others reached the place, they saw those people hurrying off toward Wangtian Cliff.

Cang Yan glanced about and asked in a deep voice, "Little junior nephew, is the one who agreed to cooperate with you here?"

"Not yet." Yang Kai shook his head; he had not spotted Zhai Yao.

"Shall we go up?" Li Wan asked, somewhat impatient.

"Wait a little longer." Cang Yan frowned. "If your deduction is correct, that brat must know secrets others do not. Acting with him, we would gain the advantage."

Those who rushed up the peak first would not necessarily laugh last; the summit was full of latent dangers, and whether they could reach Wangtian Cliff intact was uncertain.

They stood silent and waited. From time to time one or two groups of experts dashed past them, all excitedly pouring into the forest.

After about the time of a cup of tea, Zhai Yao's voice suddenly carried over: "Brother Yang!"

"This way!" Yang Kai hurriedly waved, and as he took in the forces Zhai Yao had brought, his eyes brightened.

He realized he had somewhat underestimated Zhai Yao's ability — he had actually brought seven people.

Six of them were powerful figures belonging to the human, demon, and monster races, all cultivators of the Second to Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, and there was one whose cultivation Yang Kai could not discern; that person's head and face were hidden beneath a cloak, as if unwilling to show his true appearance.

But from the skin exposed, it was evident this person was an elderly man.

Watching him, Yang Kai's expression shifted; he half-guessed something, yet did not give it away.

Cang Yan and the city lord's party of strong figures sized one another up and were all quite satisfied with the other's cultivation, believing no one would be a drag; instantly their expressions became pleasant.

"Gentlemen, this matter is of great consequence. I hope everyone will cooperate sincerely so there will be no unhappiness at the end; Brother Yang and I are quite congenial," Zhai Yao said with a smile.

The six strong figures he had brought nodded in unison. "Rest easy, Young Master Zhai."

Cang Yan also spoke. "Young brother, you are too polite. But to be cautious, allow me to confirm one thing: you truly do not need the elixir of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, correct?"

"Yes, I have already explained that to Brother Yang." Zhai Yao inclined his head.

"Good, then there is no problem." Cang Yan looked satisfied. "In that case, let us ascend."

"Not yet." Zhai Yao shook his head with a smile. "Wait a bit longer — it is not time."

"Wait longer?" Cang Yan's brow tightened. He knew such matters could not be rushed, but now that the heavenly anomaly had appeared and the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was about to bloom, so many people had surged forward; delay any further and they might lose even a sip of the benefit.

"It is still early; this is only a precursor to the heavenly anomaly. When the true phenomenon appears, it will not be too late for us to go up." Zhai Yao offered no further explanation, his demeanor relaxed and utterly untroubled.

Cang Yan and the others frowned in puzzlement. After a moment he asked, "Young brother, it's not that I don't trust you, but how much do you understand about the Thousand-Year Demon Flower?"

"More than any of you, heh heh." Zhai Yao smiled lightly.

While they spoke, Yang Kai was secretly scrutinizing the cloaked old man's face; he suspected this man was Zhai Yao's teacher.

Zhai Yao's extensive knowledge of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was precisely because of him.

The old man seemed to have noticed Yang Kai's gaze; the corner of his mouth twitched into a smile as he spoke, "Is this young brother the one who took the final victory in the Alchemical Competition that day?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"Indeed — the young are to be feared." The old man praised.

Cang Yan and the others looked at him with puzzled faces; they could not fathom this man's background, and his tone came across as somewhat grandiose.

"Yang Kai!" A coquettish call suddenly came from behind. Yang Kai turned and saw Mi Na and Elder Du hastening over, waving enthusiastically and calling out before they reached them.

When they drew near, Yang Kai looked at her speechlessly. "Why did you two come?"

Elder Du sighed helplessly. "This little lass is truly careless; she insisted on coming to see the spectacle. I couldn't dissuade her, so I came along."

"You're being reckless!" Yang Kai scolded sternly.

Mi Na stuck out her delicate tongue and demurely said, "I'm just watching. I won't go up there, so there won't be any danger."

"Then be careful yourselves." Yang Kai heaved a sigh.

Mi Na glanced around and giggled. "Aren't you guys going up? They all seem to have crowded that way."

"We're waiting." Yang Kai replied casually.

"Waiting for what?"

"Waiting for the true heavenly anomaly to appear."

Du Wan, who clearly knew little about the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, looked astonished. He then fixed his gaze upon the cloaked old man's hidden face and, after a moment's thought, hesitantly asked, "May I inquire your honorable surname?"

His tone carried a cautious nervousness.

Yang Kai's eyes flickered.

"Heh heh, there's no need to mention my name." The old man chuckled softly.

Du Wan's body trembled and his eyes suddenly widened; he stared at the man in disbelief and, voice quivering, said, "You... you are..."

Zhai Yao quickly raised a finger to his lips to hush him.

Du Wan's face brimmed with reverent excitement as if on pilgrimage. He bowed respectfully: "Disciple Du Wan pays respects to Master!"

Yang Kai and Cang Yan and the others were struck dumb on the spot, mouths agape.

Du Wan was the head of the Alchemists' Association of Giant Stone City and a famous figure across the continent; Saint-Grade alchemists were exceedingly rare, and someone of his standing was always treated as an honored guest. Yet now this renowned Saint-Grade alchemist addressed another as his Master and called himself a disciple.

The shock was immense.

Everyone was stunned, including the six Transcendent Realm experts Zhai Yao had brought; they had been acting under orders and did not truly understand Zhai Yao's or the old man's identities.

The old man smiled wryly. "There is no need for such ceremony; it will draw attention. I hide my head and face precisely because I fear attracting notice."

Du Wan awoke from his momentary reverie, beads of sweat forming on his brow as he chastised himself: "It was my negligence; please forgive me, Master."

"No matter." The old man waved his hand slowly and asked with a light laugh, "How did you recognize me?"

"Master, you do not remember?" Du Wan's expression swelled with emotion. "When I was young I once received your instruction for ten days. Though brief, I have always remembered your appearance and voice."

"I see." The old man nodded lightly.

Cang Yan's expression abruptly changed and he exclaimed, "It is him!"

Hearing Du Wan's words, Cang Yan suddenly realized what an esteemed figure this old man was, and he also understood why Ao Gu and the others had taken such care with Zhai Yao, even dispatching six Transcendent Realm experts to escort him to Wangtian Cliff.

So Zhai Yao's teacher was actually such a personage of far-reaching influence!

Only such a figure could have produced a disciple like Zhai Yao; at this moment Cang Yan understood.

"Who is it?" Fei Yu asked softly, while Li Wan and Fei Jian looked on curiously.

Cang Yan glanced at the old man; seeing he made no move to stop their recognition, he mouthed a few words.

Fei Yu and the others stared in astonishment.

Yang Kai read Cang Yan's lip movements as well.

"Tianzang Elder!"

The legendary Tianzang Elder — the only top-tier alchemist admired by the human, demon, and monster races — stood before them, and he, like Yang Kai, bore the Divine Sense Fire.

Cang Yan had recognized his identity purely because Du Wan had once told him he had studied under Tianzang Elder for ten days.

Du Wan's mention immediately brought that fact to mind for Cang Yan.

Everyone was inexplicably stirred with excitement.

The fabled Tianzang Elder stood before them; Cang Yan and the others unconsciously restrained their overbearing airs and adopted a respectful manner, their eyes filled with worship.

Yang Kai also studied this legendary figure in secret, his feelings mixed and complicated.

Those who possessed the Divine Sense Fire were exceedingly rare; alchemists with the Divine Sense Fire were rarer still. It seemed likely that only he and the master before him possessed such a thing.

That shared trait made Yang Kai eager to glean the mysteries of the Divine Sense Fire from him.

Yang Kai's own use of the Divine Sense Fire was still somewhat crude, but this master had lived for an unknown number of years and possessed far more experience and insight; if he could speak with him, Yang Kai believed he would benefit greatly.

Yet he was uncertain whether he could reveal the secret that he, too, bore the Divine Sense Fire.

As he pondered, Tianzang Elder laughed: "Since you've recognized me, I will not play at mystery."

Saying so, he lifted his head and revealed his face.

"Master, in my life I only wished to see you once more and to hear your teachings in person; now that I finally..." Du Wan was so overcome he choked on his words.

"When this matter is settled, we'll talk. I am pleased by what you have achieved. I only taught you for ten days back then, and yet you have come so far — that is all your own skill." Tianzang Elder said kindly.

Du Wan was overjoyed and quickly offered thanks.

"Don't call me 'Master' — that would draw attention. Hmm, my real name is Li Rui; you may call me Old Li." 

"Yes." Du Wan replied respectfully.
