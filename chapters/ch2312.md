## Chapter 2312 — Puppet Sprout

Puppet Sprout, ranked fifty-second on the Earth List, is as fine as a strand of hair, born thirty thousand zhang underground in darkness. It is extremely difficult to find, but once it forms a connection with its host’s mind, it can control others for its own use.

Information about this flashed through Yang Kai’s mind—he had seen it before in the Strange Insects Manual, and quickly recalled how to restrain such a thing.

This was all thanks to the Insect Emperor’s Slave-Insect Bracelet, which secretly contained the Strange Insects Manual. Otherwise, with Yang Kai’s experience and knowledge, he would have been helpless in the current situation.

Puppet Sprout is ranked low on the Strange Insect List, almost at the very end. Although it is as fine as a hair and hard to detect, and those implanted with it become like puppets, obeying every command, it has other drawbacks, which is why its ranking is not high.

Now that he knew the solution, Yang Kai delved into his Spatial Ring and began searching. In no time, he found several medicinal herbs.

The guests looked at him curiously, not knowing what he intended to do. In fact, even the mention of a Puppet Sprout left everyone confused.

Seeing him take out those herbs, they all secretly guessed whether these were meant to counter the Puppet Sprout.

“Miss Ye, do you have an earth-element Demonic Beast Inner Core of Dao Origin-Grade or higher? Lend it to me for a moment,” Yang Kai suddenly turned and asked Ye Qinghan.

Ye Qinghan was startled, then quickly searched her Spatial Ring. But before she could find one, Du Xian had already taken out a round, earth-yellow Inner Core and looked at Yang Kai, saying, “I happen to have one. If Young Master Yang doesn’t mind, please take it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Jin suddenly shouted, “Du Xian, if you still care about the ties between Tianhe City and Chiyue Sect, then take your Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters and leave this place. I will not pursue what happened earlier!”

Du Xian frowned at these words, glanced at Ye Qinghan, saw her nod slightly, and smiled, “Young Master Yang is a friend of my Chiyue Sect. Since a friend is in need, how could I stand by and do nothing?”

Luo Jin’s face turned ashen, and he nodded repeatedly, “Good, very good. I will remember what happened today. When I have time, I will visit Chiyue Sect and have a word with Ye Hen.”

Du Xian frowned slightly, but still replied calmly, “As long as it pleases the City Lord.”

As they spoke, he tossed the earth-element Demonic Beast Inner Core to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it, checked its grade and quality, and was very satisfied. He immediately sat down cross-legged, waved his hand, and a pill furnace appeared before him.

The pill furnace expanded in the wind, quickly growing to the height of a person. Dragons and phoenixes were carved on its surface, and it radiated an intense energy fluctuation—clearly no ordinary item.

“Hiss, could this kid be an Alchemist?”

“Unbelievable! That pill furnace seems to be Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level. If he can use such a furnace, doesn’t that mean he’s a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist?”

“What did he say his name was just now?”

“Yang Kai, from Lingxiao Sect—Yang Kai!”

“Yang Kai… That name sounds so familiar. I feel like I’ve heard it somewhere before.”

The crowd buzzed with discussion, many showing shocked expressions. They had already witnessed Yang Kai’s formidable strength, but seeing him take out a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level pill furnace still surprised them, sparking endless speculation.

Quite a few people now connected him to the one who had caused a stir in Four Seasons Land by refining the Supreme Mystic Pill.

After all, the names matched, both were Dao Origin Realm cultivators, and both were skilled in alchemy. The world is vast, but there can’t be many people with so many similarities.

Under everyone’s gaze, Yang Kai stoked the furnace, and the temperature in the entire hall rose sharply.

Luo Jin narrowed his eyes, watching intently, not making any move, seemingly interested in what Yang Kai would do next.

Yang Kai was quite at ease. He kept changing hand seals, inscribing spirit arrays, and tossed the herbs and the earth-element Inner Core into the furnace one after another, carefully controlling the heat.

In less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Yang Kai reached to the side, Origin Qi surging in his palm, and pulled a bowl toward him.

Then, he leapt up, came to the front of the Ink Jade Cauldron, slapped the pill furnace, sent the lid flying, and reached in to grab and draw out the contents.

What appeared was a mass of emerald green, sticky and strange, in a semi-solidified medicinal state.

From an alchemist’s perspective, opening the furnace at this point clearly meant failure, but to expel the Puppet Sprout, this was exactly what was needed.

He placed the odd, foul-smelling medicinal liquid in the bowl, then carefully brought it before Chi Yue, saying solemnly, “Senior, drink this.”

Chi Yue’s brows knitted tightly, her face pale.

As Yang Kai brought the half-finished medicinal liquid before her, she caught a whiff of an extremely foul odor—like socks that hadn’t been washed in decades. Just smelling it made her want to vomit.

How could something like this be swallowed?

Seeing her look of disgust, Yang Kai grinned, “Good medicine tastes bitter. Drink this and you’ll be fine.”

Chi Yue glared at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes full of threat, as if to say, ‘If you mess with me, you’re dead.’

Yang Kai ignored her, coaxing her like a child, “Come on, be good and drink it!”

Saying this, he pried open Chi Yue’s mouth with one hand, held the bowl with the other, and poured the contents into her mouth, secretly urging Origin Qi to help her swallow.

Gulp, gulp, gulp…

All the guests averted their eyes, their stomachs churning, feeling thoroughly unwell.

“Wah…” Suddenly, Chi Yue vomited, dropping to one knee, looking utterly miserable, as if she wanted to throw up her very organs.

Yang Kai stood by with a smile, tossed the bowl aside, and patted Chi Yue’s back.

“You brat, how dare you make me drink something like that!” Chi Yue turned, gritting her teeth and glaring at Yang Kai.

She had lived so many years and never drunk anything so difficult to swallow. If she hadn’t been restrained, how could she have suffered such humiliation today?

“Please don’t be angry, Senior. I had no choice,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Fifth Sister…” Nearby, Chai Hu stared at Chi Yue in surprise and joy, “You can move?”

Chi Yue was stunned, then as if waking from a dream, she moved her body, slowly stood up, and smiled, “I really am free!” Then, turning, she regained her dignified air and said fiercely, “I’ll let you off this time since your words were true, but if you ever make me drink that again…”

Halfway through, Chi Yue quickly covered her mouth, her face pale, as if recalling something truly unpleasant.

Soon, she shifted her gaze to Chai Hu, her face full of guilt, “Fourth Brother, I dragged you into this.”

Chai Hu laughed, “We’re family, no need for such words. I believe if I were in trouble, you wouldn’t stand by either.”

Chi Yue nodded, her face full of gratitude. She turned, her gaze icy as she looked at the middle-aged man restrained by Ye Qinghan, “You dared make me suffer like this—I want him dead!”

The middle-aged man looked blank, his eyes empty, staring at Chi Yue and muttering, “Impossible, this is impossible. Puppet Sprout is nearly extinct—how could there be a way to break it…”

He seemed unable to accept that his unique skill had been so easily broken, his mind suffering a huge blow, leaving him dazed.

Yang Kai grinned from the side, “Trying to play with bugs in front of me? You’re a few hundred years too early! Hahahaha!”

His wild, arrogant laughter drew many glances, and people thought he must be crazy.

When the laughter stopped, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and sent a burst of power to the ground, turning it into fire and burning away Chi Yue’s vomit.

At the same time, the middle-aged man seemed to suffer a heavy blow. His whole body trembled, and he involuntarily spat out a mouthful of blood. His face instantly turned deathly pale, his aura weak.

Although the Puppet Sprout was forced out, it wasn’t killed, so the man had been unharmed until now.

But Yang Kai’s strike not only destroyed the Puppet Sprout on the spot, it also impacted the man whose mind was connected to it, leaving him in a terrible state.

The reason Puppet Sprout is ranked low on the Strange Insect List is that its vitality is not as strong as other strange insects and beasts, and it can be easily destroyed. For example, Soul-Devouring Worms are not like this—killing them completely is extremely difficult.

If possible, Yang Kai would have liked to collect the Puppet Sprout into the Slave-Insect Bracelet. Maybe it could be useful in the future.

But the Puppet Sprout is very special. Once someone imprints it, it can never be used by another, so Yang Kai destroyed it without hesitation.

Seeing the middle-aged man in such a state, Chi Yue frowned but had no intention of troubling him further. Instead, her gaze turned icy as she looked at Luo Jin.

Everything she suffered today was Luo Jin’s fault. If not for Yang Kai’s miraculous appearance, saving her from disaster, not only would she have been unable to escape, but even Chai Hu would have been dragged down with her.

Naturally, she hated someone like Luo Jin to the bone.

“Little Yue, it’s not too late to come to this Lord’s side. I promise you, everything that happened before will be forgiven!” Luo Jin looked at Chi Yue and said calmly.

“Little… Yue!” Yang Kai’s eyes widened in shock.

Back in the day, the Yao King Chi Yue of Di Chen Star ruled the entire star, commanding billions of yao. Yet here in the Star Realm, she was being called Little Yue. If the other yao lords of Di Chen Star knew, who knows what they would think.

Chi Yue seemed to notice Yang Kai’s subtle expression, glared at him fiercely, then snorted coldly, “Old dog! You imprisoned my Eldest Brother and the others, forced me to marry you, and now you want me by your side? Are you still dreaming?”

Luo Jin’s face darkened, rage filling his features.

He knew that after today, his reputation would be ruined. He had hoped to salvage it through Chi Yue, but her blunt rejection left him furious, killing intent surging like a tide.
