## Chapter 803 — Indeed So

After a day of frantic work, the Sacred Land's trivial matters finally neared completion.

Night fell with no stars in sight; the dark sky loomed like a terrible beast's maw, weighing heavily above the Sacred Land.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land's guardian elders gathered to discuss how to face the calamity looming in half a month.

After all, those factions had declared that in half a month they would demand either the previous Saintess or the current Saintess—otherwise they would go to war.

Those three powers, long protected and suppressed by the Sacred Land, dared act so arrogantly only because they were supremely confident; they would not be so resolute otherwise.

The previous Saintess could not be produced. Saintess Nan's whereabouts were unknown. As for the current Saintess, handing her over was impossible. A great battle was inevitable in half a month.

It was puzzling why they had allowed An Ling'er to bring Yang Kai here to eavesdrop.

While they debated, Yang Kai remained silent—neither offering opinions nor attempting to dictate their actions.

He understood his position: though they hoped he would take the Saint Lord seat, in this crisis he held no decisive power; to them he was still too young.

So, Yang Kai tactfully kept silent.

After listening he found, to his surprise, that none of them intended to flee; all were resolved to stay and fight to defend the Sacred Land's dignity.

Yang Kai shook his head inwardly and withheld comment.

He knew the proverb about preserving the green hills for future firewood, but he also knew that escaping such a vast force was not easy—if Xu Hui and the elders fled, many disciples would be left behind.

The key now was persuading those experts whipped up by Poxuan Palace, War Soul Hall, and Netherworld Sect to withdraw; if they did, the remaining three powers could be handled by the Sacred Land's present forces.

After fruitless discussion, everyone turned their gaze to Yang Kai sitting to one side.

"Why are you looking at me? I travel alone and know little of these matters—I'll listen to what you say," he replied.

Xu Hui chuckled awkwardly, then urged gently that the young man might have some thoughts worth hearing—perhaps they could find a way out.

Others also looked to him with expectation, eager for his counsel.

Yang Kai frowned, reluctant but curious, and asked, "How many Saint Realm experts do those three troublemakers have?"

Xu Hui answered solemnly that each of the three houses only had two Saint Realm experts, mostly First Stage, except for Poxuan Palace's Zhang Ao who matched Xu Hui himself at Second Stage—so victory was uncertain.

Yang Kai considered that: six Saint Realm experts in total, five First Stage and one Second Stage.

That tally and caliber matched the Sacred Land's current strength.

The Sacred Land now had one Second Stage and five First Stage Saint Realm cultivators.

That didn't count the experts those factions had stirred up—there were bound to be many more formidable figures, and after Saintess Nan's onslaught the Sacred Land was deeply wounded and hard-pressed.

A full-scale war might doom the Sacred Land's future standing.

There were too many factions involved.

They did not wish to make so many enemies, but Saintess Nan's provocations had forced the Sacred Land to bear the blame.

"Have you considered seeking allies? The Sacred Land has existed so long—surely there are friends who could help. Ask them to lend a hand, and repay the favor later," Yang Kai suggested.

His words made everyone uncomfortable.

Yang Kai read the room and realized the Sacred Land likely had few allies—when the old Saint Lord lived they had considered themselves unrivaled, so few powers saw them as equals; now, with troubles, others would not rush to help.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, at a loss.

He could appeal to Tianxiao Sect, but help would not arrive in time; the Sacred Land might fall before reinforcements came.

Suddenly his eyes brightened. "What about the yao lord? Have you considered asking him for aid?"

Xu Hui's face changed.

"Yes—if he is a regional lord, he must be powerful and have capable retainers."

"Are you joking?" Shi Kun frowned. "They are Yao—enemies of humanity. If we seek their help, the Sacred Land would become a stain on humankind and never rise again."

Yu Ying agreed; however dire the situation, they could not approach the yao. Besides, they had never met the Yao Lord—only the old Saint Lord had some rapport, so it was uncertain whether he could be persuaded.

Yang Kai was surprised by their strong rejection and realized he had underestimated the depth of interspecies hatred here.

He was not native to the Tongxuan Continent; he had come from Zhongdu and, despite years here, those deep-rooted prejudices had not taken hold in him.

Before coming here he had not known of demons and yao as distinct races.

"There is one person—if we could find him, the Sacred Land might avert disaster easily," Xu Hui murmured, thoughtful.

Cheng Yuetong seemed to recall whom he meant.

"Yes."

"Who is he?" Yang Kai asked, curious about this extraordinary figure.

Xu Hui described a mysterious old fellow of uncertain name, an acquaintance of the old Saint Lord who had visited and stayed for some days before the old Saint Lord's death; their friendship seemed deep. If he could help, it would be ideal.

Yu Ying added that the old man had appeared formidable, and she had never seen the old Saint Lord treat anyone with such courtesy—he was clearly no ordinary person.

"Mysterious origin?" Yang Kai asked. "Can't you find him?"

They all shook their heads.

"But I think he'll come again," Xu Hui said confidently.

"Why?"

"Because when he visited the Saint Land, a young girl of his left something in a certain spot among the Nine Peaks. After he left the old Saint Lord ordered us to guard that place and let no one near. I suspect someday he and that girl will return to retrieve something."

"Indeed, that spot has been chilling ever since," Meng Tianfei said, weary—he had even moved his residence to avoid the place.

As they spoke, Yang Kai realized which place they meant—the cold, peculiar area he had felt when activating the Nine Peaks' arrays.

He had thought it a natural chill, not knowing other forces were at play.

Yet, hearing them call one “the old fellow” and the other “the little girl,” two familiar figures inexplicably surfaced in Yang Kai’s mind.

He couldn’t help but chuckle in surprise, thinking inwardly, surely it can’t be such a coincidence…

With a smile tugging at his lips, he casually asked, “This old fellow you’re talking about—could it be an elder who looks all immortal and dignified on the outside, but whose eyes are always roving lecherously?”

Xu Hui was stunned, but before he could answer, Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong were already nodding furiously. Yu Ying gnashed her teeth: “Exactly! That old man’s eyes are utterly detestable, always looking where he shouldn’t.”

Cheng Yuetong chimed in angrily: “That’s right. At his age, he still has no respect for himself. And to think we were polite enough to call him ‘Elder.’ Honestly, we ought to dig his eyeballs out!”

The two beautiful women were so incensed they looked as if the old man had truly wronged them.

Xu Hui gave a helpless laugh: “It can’t be as bad as you make it sound, right? Perhaps it’s just that his strength is so profound that his eyes shine brightly with spirit.”

Both Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong shot him a glare in unison.

“…Forget I said anything,” Xu Hui muttered awkwardly.

Yang Kai’s expression, however, turned extremely strange. His heart skipped a beat, his mood surging with inexplicable anticipation and excitement as he pressed further: “And the little girl beside him—could she be one who always wears a veil so her true face can’t be seen, with an innocent and charming temperament?”

Everyone stared at him in surprise. Xu Hui looked stunned. “Saint Lord, you… cough, young brother, how do you know this?”

“So it really is them?” Yang Kai was half amused, half exasperated, and added to confirm: “And on her forehead there’s a pale blue gem?”
