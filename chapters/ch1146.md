## Chapter 1146 — Unexpected Joy

With a light cough, suppressing the joy and excitement in his heart, Yang Kai said calmly, “Since the culprit has already been punished, let’s end today’s matter here. Young Master Xie, I hope you’ll conduct yourself properly from now on.”

"Yes, yes, thank you, Brother, thank you, Elder." Xie Hongwen wept and sobbed, repeatedly offering his thanks.

"Still not gone?" Qian Tong shouted angrily. Xie Hongwen scrambled to his feet, legs trembling as he fled into the distance. He dared not linger a moment longer; to remain would very likely cost him his life.

After the dispute was dealt with, everyone was satisfied.

Yang Kai gained the souls of two Origin Returning Realm experts; by absorbing their insights into Martial Dao he could study Shi, so of course he was pleased. As for Xie Hongwen, Yang Kai had to give Qian Tong some face—if he had actually killed Xie Hongwen, Qian Tong might have turned on Yang Kai, and that would not have been worth the gain.

Qian Tong had gone to great trouble to rescue Xie Hongwen and was also content, thinking that although Yang Kai was young, he knew when to advance and retreat—quite commendable.

It was an ending where everyone came out ahead.

“Elder Qian, my thanks for this time. This junior will remember it well,” Yang Kai said solemnly, clasping his fists in gratitude. He knew that if Qian Tong hadn’t arrived so quickly, he would have gone on a killing spree, and Xie Hongwen would have undoubtedly died. Once that happened, he would have no place to remain here. There were still plenty of Ethereal Crystals beneath Dragon Lair Mountain, and for that reason alone, Yang Kai had to thank Qian Tong — he had given him the time and space he needed.

"Nonsense, nephew is too polite," Qian Tong laughed heartily. "I did nothing special. It is you, nephew, who is extraordinary—already at the First Stage of the Saint Realm and grievously wounding Hong Zhen and the other. Your future achievements are boundless."

"It was not my skill alone; I merely made use of the formation's power," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

Qian Tong gave a knowing look and glanced more closely at the formation, but since it was not activated he could not discern its mystery, and in his heart he was secretly shaken. He began to suspect that the person behind Yang Kai might not only be an Origin-Grade artificer, but also a formation master.

His speculation was entirely correct—only he had the wrong person in mind. The Secret Treasure had been forged by Yang Yan, the formation arranged by Yang Yan, and she had been right under Elder Qian's nose the whole time—unfortunately, Elder Qian did not know.

"Does nephew have a proper place to go?" Qian Tong shifted the subject. "If not, I can recommend you to Yingyue Hall. With your aptitude, you would surely become a Core Disciple there. I only wonder whether nephew would accept such an offer."

Yang Kai knew exactly what he was angling for and slowly shook his head: "No need. I'm fine living here. I'm careless and lack etiquette—if I joined some large sect, I might only make a fool of myself."

Qian Tong smiled and did not press the matter further; he knew that pressing too hard might undo his earlier efforts. He glanced toward the cave entrance and fell silent, waiting for Yang Kai to invite him in.

In his mind, the Origin-Grade artificer and formation master behind Yang Kai was surely resting in the cave; if he were lucky and invited in, he might have the chance to meet them.

He said nothing. Yang Kai had nothing to say either—he was eager to go into seclusion to study Shi and had no desire for further conversation. He was almost ready to see them off.

The two of them stared at each other for a while, both feeling awkward.

At that key moment, Wu Yi appeared with Yang Yan, offering a graceful salute and breaking the awkward atmosphere.

"Very good," Qian Tong smiled and inclined his head. "You are a disciple of the Haike Family, yes?"

"I was, but I have left the family. I now follow Senior Brother Yang," Wu Yi said softly.

"Good—following Nephew Yang will bring far more prospects than staying with the Haike Family. Little girl, you have good judgement. Work hard; it's best if you can bind Yang nephew's body and heart."

The old man is getting presumptuous, Yang Kai cursed inwardly.

Wu Yi’s cheeks flushed slightly as she pursed her lips with a smile. “With my frail willow figure, I’m afraid I’m hardly worthy of Senior Brother Yang.”

She was not truly self-deprecating; after witnessing Yang Kai's talents she believed very few could match him. Besides, she had no real romantic notions now—Qian Tong's words were merely casual flattery and she replied in kind.

Qian Tong's gaze shifted to Yang Yan. If she had come with Wu Yi, her standing in Yang Kai's circle must be considerable; Qian Tong would not slight her.

"This is my Junior Sister," Yang Kai said before Yang Yan could speak, introducing her.

Wu Yi and Yang Yan both looked at him in astonishment.

"Oh—so she is your Junior Sister. Not bad, not bad."

"She is also a Saint-Grade artificer," Yang Kai added deliberately.

Qian Tong's eyes lit up and he laughed heartily: "At such a yount age she is already a Saint-Grade artificer—at this rate your Junior Sister's future will not be beneath your own."

"Indeed, Junior Sister is very capable," Yang Kai hastened to nod.

"I had thought the disciples inside sects were already admirable, but seeing you two I realize how poor many sect disciples truly are. What a pity. If your two could join my Yingyue Hall, it would be splendid."

“In the future, if we ever choose to join a sect or power, our first choice will definitely be Yingyue Hall.”

Qian Tong laughed and nodded with satisfaction. "Then I will await good news from you, nephew!"

Seeing that Yang Kai had no intention of entertaining him further, Qian Tong did not linger in idle chatter; he took his leave and turned to go.

He had not gone far when he suddenly turned back.

"Elder Qian, was there something else?" Yang Kai watched him with curiosity.

Qian Tong asked, "Would nephew care to attend the auction at Jubao Tower?"

"An auction?" Yang Kai frowned—he had never attended such an event and had little interest. His greatest desire was to go into seclusion and study Shi. As he thought to refuse, though, he noticed Wu Yi and Yang Yan both wearing expectant expressions, and he changed his mind. "When is it?"

Qian Tong drew a golden invitation from his Spatial Ring and handed it to Yang Kai. "Time and place are on it. If nephew has the time you can take a look—even if nothing suits you, it will be entertaining. Of course, if you have good items you can sell them there; auction prices are often far higher than ordinary sales."

Yang Kai took the invitation without examining it and passed it to Wu Yi. "If we have time, let's go and take a look."

"Good. I will attend as well; you may use my name, nephew," Qian Tong said, and then finally departed.

Once he was gone, Yang Kai glanced around and found the Haike Family's people had long since vanished. He had no idea where they had gone, but he trusted Wu Yi would not make things difficult for them.

"Yang Kai, why did you tell him that she's your Junior Sister?" Yang Yan asked, looking at him in puzzlement.

"Come inside and I'll tell you," Yang Kai beckoned mysteriously.

Outside the cave, Yu Feng and the many disciples of the Haike Family gazed at Yang Kai with faces full of admiration, regarding him as nothing short of a heavenly being.

To grievously wound two Origin Returning Realm cultivators—even with the aid of a formation—is not something just anyone can achieve. Earlier, with so many people present, most had maintained composure; only now did their admiration and shock show.

"All of you, go and cultivate," Yang Kai waved them off and led Wu Yi and Yang Yan into his stone chamber. Only after closing the stone door did he let them sit.

Seeing Yang Kai take on such a solemn demeanor, Wu Yi and Yang Yan could not help but mirror his seriousness; they understood he had something important to say.

"Are you wondering why Elder Qian treated me so well?" Yang Kai voiced the question they had both harbored.

"Yes." Wu Yi nodded.

"He is kind to me for a reason," Yang Kai said, turning his gaze to Yang Yan. "Because of you!"

Wu Yi considered and guessed, "Because of Yang Yan's formation?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "Because Yang Yan can forge Origin-Grade Secret Treasures!"

"What?" Wu Yi was shocked. Since coming here, Yang Yan had not forged any Secret Treasures and had only been arranging formations, so Wu Yi had not known she possessed such a skill. Now that Yang Kai revealed it, she immediately understood why Qian Tong had treated him as he did.

"However, although Qian Tong knows I have an Origin-Grade artificer behind me, he does not know that person is Yang Yan; he likely assumes that person is my master," Yang Kai said, offering his conjecture.

"I understand—he is courting the person he imagines exists," Wu Yi said with a nod.

"Correct. Previously I did not know that the finest artificer on Dark Star was only Origin-Grade Lower-Level; had I known, I would not have sold those Secret Treasures. Now it's too late, but the important thing is that even an Origin-Grade artificer is someone Qian Tong would not dare offend—he would try to win them over instead, so we face no danger." Yang Kai looked at Yang Yan intently and added in a sterner tone, "In future you must not go around proclaiming yourself an Origin-Grade artificer. Your strength is too low—if discovered, you will be seized!"

Yang Yan pouted, "Even if I proclaimed it, no one would believe me."

Recently she had assisted at the Refining Pavilion in Tianyun City and had openly stated her artificer rank, but no one believed her nor were they willing to provide Origin-Grade materials for her to work with.

“No matter what, you must never say such things again. Otherwise, we’ll all be doomed,” Yang Kai said, his tone turning heavier. “Understand?”

“I got it,” Yang Yan nodded.

Yang Kai was helpless—he realized he and Yang Yan were entirely different sorts of people. He preferred others not know his alchemist rank; the lower they thought of him, the better. Yang Yan, however, boasted loudly and seemed to get away with it. The ways of this world were peculiar indeed.

"No wonder you told Qian Tong that Yang Yan was a Saint-Grade artificer and said she was your Junior Sister—now I see your meaning," Wu Yi said, her keen mind quickly uncovering Yang Kai's intent.

"Exactly. Qian Tong has already formed the notion that I have an Origin-Grade artificer master behind me; given that, having a Saint-Grade Junior Sister seems perfectly natural."
