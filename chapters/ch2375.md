## Chapter 2375 — Just How Strong Is He

Staring at the cold and resolute Yang Kai, Yang Leshui felt a chill run through his entire body, a creeping sense that he had provoked someone truly terrifying. Regret flooded his heart.

Even if he managed to escape with his life this time, the enormous loss was something he could never explain to the Pavilion Master. When the time came, he would surely have to face the Pavilion Master's wrath.

"So, should I kill you with a single sword strike, or stab you to death one thrust at a time?" A wicked smile spread across Yang Kai's face.

Yang Leshui trembled and cried out in terror, "You can't kill me... I'm the Vice Pavilion Master of Xuanyun Pavilion! I'm under Mi Tian's command—if you kill me, he will never let you go!"

"Mi Tian?" Yang Kai said coldly. "That guy at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm?"

"That's right! The Pavilion Master treats me very well!" Yang Leshui hurriedly replied, thinking Yang Kai recognized Mi Tian's reputation.

But Yang Kai only showed a look of disdain, curling his lip. "First Stage of the Emperor Realm? That's nothing. It's not like I haven't killed one before!"

Yang Leshui's first reaction was that this guy was bragging! How could a First Stage of the Emperor Realm be so easy to kill? And to hear such words from a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator—how absurd did that sound?

But he didn't dare refute it, only saying, "Spare me, and I can give you many benefits. If you kill me, you'll never be able to take a single step on Tongtian Island!"

Yang Kai's expression turned cold. "You're about to die and you still dare threaten me?"

"I'm just telling the truth. Besides, with your current strength, killing me won't be easy. Why risk mutual destruction? Wouldn't it be better for us to sit down and talk?"

Yang Kai sneered, "Talk? That requires both sides to be equals. I could take your life with a flick of my finger. What right do you have to negotiate with me?"

"Don't underestimate this Lord! Even a rotten ship has three pounds of nails!"

"You think too highly of yourself." Yang Kai snorted, and with that, the Myriad Sword in his hand slashed down at him.

Yang Leshui was struck with terror. He hadn't expected that, despite all his pleading, the other party would still attack. In that instant, anger and panic surged in his heart. Without any more hesitation, he immediately summoned a shield Secret Treasure to block in front of him.

Szzzt—

A crisp sound rang out. Yang Leshui was horrified to find that his shield Secret Treasure shattered instantly, offering no protection at all. The moment the opponent's sword fell, it was destroyed. The might of the Imperial Treasure cut straight into his body, splitting him in two.

Was this even human? Even in death, Yang Leshui couldn't believe it—a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm like himself was wiped out so easily. If he'd known the gap in strength was so vast, he would have fled at once. At least then, he might have had a chance to survive.

The deck soon became empty. Aside from the corpses strewn everywhere, only Yang Kai remained. Even Liu Qianyun had gone off with Jiao Yi and the others to chase down the fleeing enemies.

Yang Kai reached out and drew the Spatial Rings from the dead cultivators over to himself. After a quick inspection, he tossed them aside in disdain.

These cultivators must have lived in the Jixu Secret Realm for a long time. Their rings were filled with all sorts of junk, but nothing of real value. With Yang Kai's current wealth, he couldn't be bothered to examine them.

Yang Leshui's shield Secret Treasure had been decent, but after being split by the Myriad Sword, it was now worthless.

Ignoring the Spatial Rings, Yang Kai turned his gaze to the massive multi-deck ship.

This multi-deck ship had been brought here by Yang Leshui and his group. In the Jixu Secret Realm, these large Secret Treasures for sea travel seemed quite common. Yang Kai figured he might need to go out to sea himself in the future, so he leapt over to the other ship, entered the cabin, found the control core, and began refining it.

After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Ling Yinqin and the others returned from different directions. Not a single crew member was missing—aside from a few injuries, everyone was basically unharmed.

Once everyone gathered and exchanged updates, Ling Yinqin couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.

Not a single Xuanyun Pavilion cultivator who fled survived; they were all hunted down. There was no longer any worry that news of this would reach Tongtian Island.

Dangers often occurred on the Jixu Sea. The disappearance of Yang Leshui's entire crew was nothing unusual. Xuanyun Pavilion might not even suspect Ling Yinqin and her group. Even if they did, there would be no evidence, so she had nothing to worry about.

Calming herself, Ling Yinqin belatedly felt a chill as if she'd just walked through the gates of hell. She ordered the crew to clean the deck and toss the corpses into the sea. Spreading out her Divine Sense, she found Yang Kai refining the Xuanyun Pavilion's multi-deck ship and didn't disturb him. Instead, she pulled Liu Qianyun aside and quietly asked, "What's the deal with your Senior Brother?"

If not for Yang Kai, they probably wouldn't have encountered such trouble. But at the same time, without him, all their gains would have been stolen by Yang Leshui.

Ling Yinqin was truly grateful to Yang Kai, but what puzzled her most was how he could unleash such terrifying power. Xuanyun Pavilion had brought over thirty cultivators on their ship, yet Yang Kai had almost single-handedly wiped them all out.

Such an unbelievable feat—only someone in the Emperor Realm could manage that, right?

With such overwhelming power, if he turned against them, who on this ship could possibly resist?

Ling Yinqin felt even more fortunate that she had stopped Jiao Yi and the others from acting greedy that day. Otherwise, they might not even know how they died.

Though her question was vague, Liu Qianyun understood what she meant. After a moment's thought, she said, "Senior Brother is no ordinary person. Just a few days ago, we were chased by a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert and still managed to escape alive. That was all thanks to Senior Brother."

"You survived being chased by a Third Stage Emperor?" Ling Yinqin was shocked.

She had never experienced the power of the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, but she knew that a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator being hunted by one had no chance of survival.

But Yang Kai had managed to pull it off, which meant he was no ordinary Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

"Senior Brother is amazing. He even injured that Third Stage of the Emperor Realm." Liu Qianyun added, as if she hadn't noticed Ling Yinqin's shock.

"Injured..." Ling Yinqin was completely stunned, feeling like her mind couldn't keep up. Everything she heard was beyond her comprehension.

"It was a sneak attack, and that Third Stage of the Emperor Realm was already injured."

Even with Liu Qianyun's explanation, Ling Yinqin's mind was still buzzing. She stared blankly in the direction of the multi-deck ship, silent for a long time.

"Big Sis, they had a lot of good stuff! That Yang Leshui actually carried over two hundred thousand Source Crystals on him. We really hit the jackpot this time." Jiao Yi walked over with a look of joy, handing a Spatial Ring to Ling Yinqin.

Ling Yinqin finally came back to her senses and said, "You all split the loot among yourselves, but throw away all the Secret Treasures and anything distinctive. Don't bring any of it back to Tongtian Island!"

If they brought back Secret Treasures or distinctive items, it could expose them and let Xuanyun Pavilion trace things back. Ling Yinqin would never allow that to happen.

Jiao Yi felt it was a pity, but he knew Big Sis was right. He agreed and turned to divide the spoils with the others.

The deck was soon spotless. All the corpses had been thrown into the sea, and the blood washed away completely.

But Yang Kai still hadn't come out, so Ling Yinqin could only keep waiting.

About a day later, the multi-deck ship across from them hummed, the whole vessel shaking. In the next moment, with a flash of light, the massive ship vanished, and Yang Kai appeared before everyone.

He looked exhausted, his face a bit pale, but in his palm was a beautifully miniaturized multi-deck ship—clearly the one from Xuanyun Pavilion.

"That fast!" Even though Ling Yinqin already knew how strong Yang Kai was, she couldn't help but be surprised.

Yang Kai had refined the ship's restrictions in just one day. If someone else had said so, she would never have believed it, but the truth was right in front of her.

Just how strong was this man?

Ling Yinqin had already tried to estimate Yang Kai's strength as highly as possible, but still found she had underestimated him. Even an Emperor Realm cultivator couldn't refine that multi-deck ship in just a day. She'd thought they'd have to wait here for a month or two.

Lost in thought, she saw Yang Kai put the multi-deck ship into his Spatial Ring and, with a flicker, appear on the deck.

The dozen or so crew members all looked at him with awe. Jiao Yi opened his mouth, as if wanting to say something, but couldn't. After seeing Yang Kai's strength yesterday, he no longer had the confidence to call him brother.

"Sorry for causing everyone trouble," Yang Kai said apologetically.

He knew that the reason Xuanyun Pavilion's people had found Ling Yinqin and the others was most likely because Zhang Ruoxi's breakthrough had drawn them over. Otherwise, how could they have run into each other on this vast sea?

So, in the end, it was all because of him.

Hearing this, the crew all waved their hands and shook their heads.

What a joke—Xuanyun Pavilion's people had been slaughtered by Yang Kai in the blink of an eye. That alone showed how terrifying his strength was. With him being so polite, how could they dare take it seriously?

Observing their reactions, Yang Kai knew these people must be quite wary of him.

"Brother Yang, we should be the ones thanking you. You saved us from a disaster," Ling Yinqin said.

Yang Kai had a very good impression of this woman. Earlier, she had been willing to hand over all her gains just to ensure his and Liu Qianyun's safety. He'd seen it all. It was just a pity that Yang Leshui was so clueless and greedy—he brought about his own death.

"Big Sister Ling, you're being too serious. If anything, this was my fault," Yang Kai said awkwardly. He didn't know how to explain what had happened before, nor was it easy to do so, so he could only be vague.

"How are you feeling now?" Ling Yinqin asked with a frown. Yang Kai had failed his breakthrough, cut his own cultivation, fought a fierce battle, and then spent energy refining the multi-deck ship. In her eyes, he was courting death. "You should rest for a while."
