## Chapter 433 — Truly Cunning to the Extreme

After a long silence, a white-haired old man finally asked in a voice sounding incredibly weak, "Which son’s residence is that in the northwest corner of the Yang Family?"

Someone thought for a moment and replied, "It seems to be the youngest one."

Everyone nodded softly, praising, "Since ancient times, heroes emerge from the young; this holds true indeed."

Yang Liting, the Grand Elder of the Yang Family, could not help but laugh heartily, his face full of pride. Although he had long since abandoned worldly desires and reached the realm of a heart as still as water, after witnessing Yang Kai’s performance tonight, he was deeply comforted, feeling that the Yang Family had worthy successors.

The Grand Elder of the Qiu Family, Daoist Qiu, nodded and said, "Brave and personally powerful, but in the succession war, these two qualities alone are not enough to win. I wonder if he has more allies."

"Keep a close eye on him. This succession war looks to be more thrilling than in past years."

Everyone nodded in agreement.

The eight Grand Elders who had surpassed the Divine Roaming Realm were ancestors of great families. Before nightfall, they had already extended their Divine Sense to every corner of War City, monitoring for any disturbances.

Yang Kai’s movements naturally did not escape their perception.

However, one thing puzzled them all: how did he suddenly unleash such a powerful and strange Divine Sense?

At his cultivation realm, he simply should not have any Divine Sense at all. The only explanation was that this youngest Yang Family son possessed a Divine Soul Treasure of immense power, able to release such Divine Sense pressure, creating an illusion.

Though the eight were quite interested in Yang Kai, their concern only went so far. These eight elders would neither interfere in nor participate in the succession war. If Yang Kai won, they would be pleased; if he lost, they would not care, including Yang Liting. This was their mutual stance.

Only after these eight withdrew their ocean-like Divine Sense did Yang Kai involuntarily exhale a breath of Primordial Qi, the faint vigilance on his face finally eased. He glanced subtly towards Fengshen Hall.

He sensed that he was being watched by not just one person.

Yet their Divine Sense was too powerful for him to conceal his whereabouts. Remembering the rumors, Yang Kai quickly realized exactly who was spying on him.

He needed to ascend to the Divine Roaming Realm quickly. With the protection of his Sea of Consciousness and aided by the Warm Spirit Lotus, he believed he could evade the eight elders’ surveillance. Only then would his actions become unrestrained.

Being monitored felt unpleasant, even though he knew they would not act. Yang Kai would not allow this continued.

There were too many secrets on him.

"Yang Kai!" Qiu Yimeng called out happily, rising from the Grand Tutor’s chair and looking upward.

Yang Kai scanned below and ordered, "Have someone clean all the bloodstains and corpses here."

The bodies on the ground were all his own people’s. Enemy corpses had already been taken away. The Autumn Rain Hall of the Qiu Family had lost six individuals, and Xiang Tianxiao’s men had lost seven. Thirteen corpses lay spread before the main hall, the stench of blood overwhelming.

After speaking, Yang Kai flickered and appeared in front of Qu Gaoyi.

In this battle, Qu Gaoyi had alone held back the ferocious attack of nearly ten Divine Roaming Realm masters, some at the seventh or eighth stage—a feat nearing his limit.

Had it not been for his fierce effort, the outcome tonight might have been direly uncertain.

Now, Qu Gaoyi’s body, newly recovered, was gravely wounded again, soaked in blood—both enemy and his own—with tearing wounds that looked frighteningly gruesome.

"Understood your commands, Young Master!" Qu Gaoyi gritted his teeth and spoke deeply.

"You did well," Yang Kai said lightly, nodding.

Receiving praise, Qu Gaoyi smiled broadly, his burly frame swaying slightly.

From the darkness, a shadowy figure suddenly appeared. Ying Jiu emerged to support Qu Gaoyi, preventing him from falling.

"Take him back to rest," Yang Kai ordered Ying Jiu.

"Yes." Ying Jiu nodded and helped Qu Gaoyi disappear slowly.

Yang Kai then turned and looked at the two masked and cloaked figures in black, chuckling softly: "Thank you both."

The two said nothing but returned the salute with a fist-palm gesture, then left like a whirlwind.

Huo Xingchen watched them closely, his eyes locking onto their backs like a leech, letting out a sinister chuckle.

After they departed, Huo Xingchen looked at Yang Kai with an exasperated expression, grinding his teeth: "You’re formidable! You plotted right over my head."

Yang Kai smiled amiably, gently shaking his head: "No need for them. Tonight is safe here, at worst you’d be taken away."

"Very well, Young Master, I won’t argue." Huo Xingchen knew Yang Kai spoke the truth. With Ying Jiu at full strength hiding nearby, neither Yang Zhao nor Yang Shen dared act rashly. If they two cooperated sincerely, using one blood servant to distract Ying Jiu while the other snatched the command flag, they might succeed.

But would they cooperate?

They were rivals, allying only when it benefited them, unwilling to make sacrifices for others.

Yang Kai obviously anticipated this, which was why he boldly acted alone.

The Autumn Rain Hall and Xiang Tianxiao’s men were collecting the bodies. Yang Kai surveyed them and loudly said, "This succession war is your voluntary battle. You must mentally prepare yourselves for the casualties."

Upon hearing this, those from Autumn Rain Hall and the Xiang Family frowned. They thought Yang Kai was ungrateful—when others came to assist him in the succession, and they died here, he had not even said a word of comfort, much less thanks.

"What does it matter if you are a Yang Family son? Those who died here aren’t cattle; they were living beings!"

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold. Then he shifted tone and continued, "Those who died, I have engraved in my heart. One day, I will compensate you with several times your losses. So survive, and wait."

Qiu Yimeng’s expression immediately brightened, softly smiling.

These words were enough. Although she had not spent long with Yang Kai, she had never heard him make empty promises.

A man who does not often promise is surely one who always keeps his word!

At once, Qiu Yimeng was filled with hope for the future.

She still recalled Yang Kai saying that what he needed was allies who would stand steadfastly by him even in his darkest hour. Those seeking entanglements of interest, he did not need.

Now, everyone present had come to his side during his weakest moment. No matter their reasons, they had clearly earned his recognition.

The earlier the investment in the succession war, the greater the returns.

If you want to be close to a man, do so when he is weak. Wait till he is strong, and chances are gone.

Qiu Yimeng felt fortunate she had made the right choice. This man truly was one who could bring miracles.

The manor was severely damaged from this battle. After the Autumn Rain Hall and Xiang Family finished collecting the corpses, they immediately began repairs without any rest.

Qiu Yimeng behaved like a true housekeeper, commanding the limited forces available to patch up the holes and broken walls of Yang Kai’s residence.

The Eldest Young Master Huo was nowhere to be found, and no one knew where he had gone.

Outside War City, Huo Xingchen strode arrogantly forward, walking ten miles before finally stopping and calling out, "Come out, what are you hiding for?"

At once, two elderly men of the Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage stepped out from the shadows and respectfully greeted him, "Young Master."

Huo Xingchen looked at them with complicated expression and then said after a long moment, "Father sent you to secretly protect me?"

One nodded, "Yes. Master feared something might happen to you tonight, so he had us watch in secret."

Huo Xingchen was the only heir of the Huo Family. Though Huo Zheng could not help but be angry and had vehemently opposed his alliance with Yang Kai during the day, storming off in a huff, he could not be at ease leaving his son in such danger. Naturally, he made arrangements that finally put his mind at rest.

"Father wants you to protect me secretly!" Huo Xingchen clenched his jaw, "Don’t you understand what 'secretly' means? Then why are you out here? Yang Zhao’s blood servants wouldn’t dare kill me—at most I’d be captured. Not a hair on my head would fall! And you two actually... have your faces covered, hiding yourselves like cowards. You’re disgraceful! You’ve pissed me off! Thankfully your actions were hidden and only briefly clashed with the blood servants. Otherwise, if this got out, our Huo Family would be utterly humiliated."

Among the Eight Great Families participating in the succession war from Zhongdu, except for Yang Family blood servants, no expert exceeded the Fifth Stage of Divine Roaming Realm. For the Huo Family’s two elders to face off at the Eighth Stage, if word spread, they would become a laughing stock.

The two seniors exchanged a glance, looking embarrassed. The one who had spoken replied, "We had no choice, Young Master."

"Don’t give me excuses. What choice? Tell me." Huo Xingchen gave them a sidelong glance.

The old men blushed and hesitated, then recounted the events of the day.

Huo Xingchen’s face darkened as he listened. When done, he laughed dryly, "Two pots of wine bribed you? You might as well join the Qiu Family or Yang Family. I doubt the Huo Family has that kind of fine wine to offer you."

"Young Master, please calm down!" The two trembled with fear, quickly explaining, "Those two pots were personally delivered by Miss Qiu. We simply couldn’t refuse."

Huo Xingchen curled his lips, glared at them, then swore through clenched teeth, "That pair of treacherous adulterers, truly cunning beyond measure! Also, you fools didn’t even hide yourselves well and got discovered." (To be continued...)
