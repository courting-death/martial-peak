## Chapter 2143 — One Against Three

The moment the three from Evil Moon Valley made their move, Liu Yan instantly made a decision, summoning the Divine Spirit Feather to shield Zhang Ruoxi. Only then could she fight without restraint.

"Screech..." A piercing cry echoed across the land, snapping Huagu and the others out of their fear. The three looked up, but Liu Yan was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a strange-looking Fire Bird, over ten zhang long and wreathed in blazing red flames, soared into the sky.

Within the strange bird, lightning flickered—she possessed both thunder and fire, two domineering attributes.

"She's not human!" Zhou An finally shouted, belatedly realizing the truth.

Liu Yan revealed her true form, and Zhou An finally understood why she had seemed odd before. From the first glance, he felt this woman was different, not a being of flesh and blood. Now, he could be certain—Liu Yan was not a living creature.

"It's an Artifact Spirit!" Huagu also realized, his once fearful eyes now gleaming with greed. He couldn't help but laugh: "Hahaha, Heaven truly helps me! I was just worrying about how to improve my Blazing Flame Cudgel, and now I've found an Artifact Spirit!"

As he spoke, he shouted to the other two: "Junior Brothers, I only want this Artifact Spirit. Once I get it, you can split everything else. No objections, right?"

Zhou An and Xiong Ning exchanged glances and nodded, "We'll let Senior Brother decide!"

"Good!" Huagu nodded, staring sinisterly at Liu Yan. "Judging by your form, you have your own intelligence. To cultivate to this level is no easy feat. Out of kindness, I'll spare your life—enter my Blazing Flame Cudgel, and I promise not to erase your Divine Sense. How about it?"

As he spoke, he summoned a cudgel-shaped Secret Treasure. Its aura was dense, its spirit keen—clearly an Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade artifact!

Such a Secret Treasure was extremely rare. If Liu Yan, an Artifact Spirit, could inhabit it and Huagu refined it, the Blazing Flame Cudgel might even qualify to become an Imperial Treasure!

As a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, Huagu could even use the power of an Imperial Treasure to glimpse the mysteries of the Emperor Realm.

So even though he knew the Xuan Realm Pearl was valuable, he was willing to give it up, just to subdue Liu Yan. After all, his own cultivation was the foundation of his strength.

Liu Yan's answer was a pillar of fire!

The Blazing Flame shot down from the sky, as if to melt the earth, carrying scorching heat.

The three from Evil Moon Valley hurriedly dodged!

Huagu, still unwilling to relent, snarled, "Don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit! If you kept that thing to deal with us, this old man might show a measure of caution. But you’ve turned it into a shield to guard that girl—what do you have left to fight us with?"

The thing he referred to was, of course, Luanfeng's Feather.

In his view, Liu Yan had made a mistake by using her strongest treasure for defense. She could protect Zhang Ruoxi, but she was no match for the three of them. Once they dealt with Liu Yan, how could Zhang Ruoxi survive?

It would be better to ignore Zhang Ruoxi's fate and use the Divine Spirit power in Luanfeng's Feather to attack the three of them directly.

"Whoosh..." Another pillar of fire shot down from the sky.

"Playing with fire in front of this master!" Huagu snorted coldly, spinning the Blazing Flame Cudgel to meet the attack. The fire pillar was completely absorbed by the cudgel, and he shouted triumphantly, "Looks like your intelligence is quite limited."

"Screech!" A crisp cry rang out again as Liu Yan opened her mouth, unleashing fireballs the size of basins, raining down everywhere.

"I told you it's useless, yet you keep trying!" Huagu shouted impatiently, sending the Blazing Flame Cudgel to meet the attack again.

Boom boom boom...

The explosions shook the world, and the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth became chaotic.

"What!" Huagu's expression suddenly changed. He quickly recalled his Blazing Flame Cudgel, only to find arcs of lightning wrapped around it. The pure lightning power made his whole body numb.

"Such powerful lightning?" Huagu's greed and desire grew even stronger. An Artifact Spirit like this was a once-in-ten-thousand-years find. If he could subdue her, his Blazing Flame Cudgel might not only become an Imperial Treasure, but also gain lightning power!

"Senior Brother, stop talking to her! Since she won't surrender, let's beat her until she does!" Zhou An, having dodged two attacks, was clearly impatient.

"Fine, but be careful—not a scratch on her spirit!" Huagu nodded, reminding them.

Zhou An snorted, "Junior Brother's attacks are never gentle. If she gets hurt, it's her own fault."

With that, Zhou An flicked his wrist, producing a long spear. Flowers bloomed from its tip as he attacked Liu Yan.

The silent Xiong Ning also revealed his killing move, pressing his palms together and unleashing Origin Qi with a sudden strike.

"Mixed Yuan Divine Spear!"

"Blazing Sun Ghost Hand!"

The two Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators used Law Power to draw on the forces of heaven and earth, their attacks fierce and overwhelming, all aimed at Liu Yan.

Liu Yan's body flickered, a layer of burning flames forming a barrier around her imposing form to block the attacks from both sides.

Boom boom...

Liu Yan let out a mournful cry as the flame barrier shattered instantly. Though it blocked most of the damage, some still got through, making her body flicker and nearly lose its form.

As the barrier vanished, Huagu suddenly appeared before Liu Yan. His expression cold, he shouted, "Look into my eyes!"

His eyes turned into two swirling vortices, trying to pull out Liu Yan's soul.

This was clearly a soul secret technique, used at the perfect moment so Liu Yan couldn't avoid it and was instantly caught.

Although Liu Yan had recently broken through to the Dao Origin Realm and was strong, her opponents outnumbered her and each had higher cultivation. Against all three, she couldn't resist.

Hit by the soul secret technique, Liu Yan froze in midair, her wings slowing, her mind muddled, unable to fight back.

Seeing this, Huagu was overjoyed, feeling things were going surprisingly smoothly. He could already imagine refining the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit into his Blazing Flame Cudgel and upgrading his treasure to an Imperial Treasure.

A beautiful future seemed to be unfolding before him.

"Careful, Senior Brother!" Zhou An suddenly shouted.

"What?" Huagu was startled, but soon his eyes widened. In the Fire Bird's eyes burned an unusual flame—one that seemed able to scorch the soul. The moment it touched him, his Sea of Consciousness churned and his head throbbed painfully.

Sun’s True Fire!

Liu Yan had followed Yang Kai for so long, absorbing countless strands of Sun's True Essence and Sun’s True Fire, and had also fused Qiantian Thunderflame and Kunlan Blue Ice Flame, two rare world flames. Without these, Liu Yan could never have gained her own intelligence as an Artifact Spirit. Her flames were incredibly complex, each one a rare treasure.

Huagu's attempt to use a soul secret technique on Liu Yan was clearly wishful thinking.

In an instant, Huagu cried out, retreating and clutching his head, angrily shouting at Liu Yan, "You really refuse to submit to me?"

He became almost deranged, screaming, "Fine! If you won't surrender, I'll destroy your mind!"

With that, he formed a seal with both hands, and the Blazing Flame Cudgel grew larger, turning into a streak of fire that shot toward Liu Yan like an arrow.

At the same time, Zhou An and Xiong Ning unleashed their killing moves again, their momentum fierce.

The three attacked together, and panic finally appeared in Liu Yan's eyes. She twisted her body, sending out countless bolts of thunder and fire, mixed with pale blue ice flames, trying to block them.

The earth-shaking sounds rang out, energy raging everywhere. Zhou An and Xiong Ning's attacks were stopped, but the Blazing Flame Cudgel still shot straight at Liu Yan, its speed undiminished.

At this rate, the Blazing Flame Cudgel would pierce Liu Yan's body and seriously injure her.

"You brought this on yourself!" Huagu's eyes flashed with pain, but he didn't regret it. An Artifact Spirit with its own intelligence was far more valuable than a mindless one. Since she wouldn't submit, he had to strike.

But just then, an unusual power surged, and a heroic figure appeared before Liu Yan, reaching out and gently pressing forward, uttering, "Banish!"

As the hand fell, the void split open, and a pitch-black hole formed.

The Blazing Flame Cudgel plunged into the black hole...

"No!" Huagu's face changed, and he quickly summoned his Origin Qi, desperately calling out. Just before the black hole closed, he managed to retrieve his Secret Treasure.

Watching the black hole close rapidly, cold sweat broke out on Huagu's forehead.

He hadn't seen such a secret technique before, but he knew that if he hadn't reacted quickly, his Secret Treasure would have been lost forever.

"Who are you!" Zhou An shouted angrily, glaring at the newcomer.

Xiong Ning narrowed his eyes, sizing up the figure ahead.

In the sky, a young man stood quietly in front of the Fire Bird, his cold gaze sweeping below, his face dark with anger.

Yang Kai was in a foul mood. He had thought the canyon below was safe—he'd checked for demonic beasts and felt secure leaving Zhang Ruoxi and Liu Yan here, even leaving the Xuan Realm Pearl behind.

But unexpectedly, not long after he left, this disaster struck, forcing him to rush back.
