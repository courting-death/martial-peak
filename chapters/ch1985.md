## Chapter 1985 — Still Alive

Yang Kai had come to this black market because he had some unavoidable difficulties.

The greatest of those difficulties was the more than three hundred Origin Condensing Pills.

He had privately withheld those Origin Condensing Pills; he could not possibly use them all himself, keeping them would be waste, and selling them... there were no good channels, for the provenance of this batch was not exactly aboveboard.

Yang Kai could not very well open a shop and sell these pills himself; if he did, the people at the Spiritual Pill workshop would surely criticize him.

So he had no choice but to come to this black market.

This was the best and most fitting place.

He basically had no Source Crystals left; selling this batch of Spiritual Pills would at least tide him over.

Before long, a round, chubby man pushed through the door. His face was ruddy and his body flabby; when he walked the floorboards creaked. His eyes were already narrowed to slits, and a gleam flashed within them.

Upon entering, the fat man clasped his fists warmly and said, "I am Jin Fugui; greetings, Young Master."

He was tactful enough not to ask Yang Kai's name, because people who came here disliked others prying into their background.

Yang Kai rose and said, "Shopkeeper Jin, you are too polite."

Looking him over, Yang Kai discovered the fat man was also at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; the power in his body was extremely robust, and it seemed his Origin Qi transformation was complete. Such existences were not many in Fenglin City, but they did exist; like Kang Siran and Zhuo Ningsi, he could be considered one of Fenglin City's experts.

Jin Fugui sat down genialy; the chair beneath him gave a grinding groan.

He smiled and looked at Yang Kai, saying, "I heard from the lads that you have a batch of Spiritual Pills for sale?"

"That is correct!"

Jin Fugui's little eyes brightened as he said, "May I ask what kind of Spiritual Pills you have? I, Jin, still have some standing in Fenglin City, so if you trade here you can rest assured — my offers are always fair, have a good reputation, and I would never divulge a customer's information. Please put your mind at ease on that point."

"If Shopkeeper Jin says that, all the better," Yang Kai nodded. He reached into his Spatial Ring and took out a jade bottle, pushing it to Jin Fugui. "Shopkeeper Jin, take a look; these are the Spiritual Pills I wish to sell."

Jin Fugui glanced up at Yang Kai, then picked up the jade bottle and opened the lid, peering inside.

The next moment he could not help raising his brows. He exclaimed, "Origin Condensing Pills?"

Origin Condensing Pills had never lacked a market, especially on this black market. Every day there were no fewer than eight thousand, perhaps even ten thousand, people waiting to buy Origin Condensing Pills; such Spiritual Pills, whether openly or covertly, were snatched up as soon as they appeared.

Therefore Jin Fugui was extremely satisfied with the goods Yang Kai had brought.

"How many do you have?"

Yang Kai gestured a number with his hand.

"Three hundred?" Jin Fugui was moved. "You actually managed to obtain three hundred Origin Condensing Pills?"

A single Origin Condensing Pill, when taken, could provide a First Stage of the Void King Realm warrior with ten days' worth of use; for a Second Stage it was roughly six to seven days; for a Third Stage only three to four days.

So three hundred Origin Condensing Pills might seem not many at first glance, but they were by no means few. Any Void King Realm warrior who obtained them could be free of worries about Origin Qi conversion for years or even decades to come.

What puzzled Jin Fugui most was where Yang Kai had gotten such a large batch of Origin Condensing Pills!

But since it concerned secret matters, he was sensible enough not to inquire.

After a moment's thought, Jin Fugui said, "The quantity is indeed considerable, but the quality is unknown..."

Yang Kai smiled, "Shopkeeper Jin can try one."

Jin Fugui did not refuse; he nodded and said, "Then please excuse my rudeness."

As he spoke, he poured out an Origin Condensing Pill from the jade bottle and popped it into his mouth, silently circulating his profound art to assimilate it. A moment later, the fat on his face trembled slightly, and astonishment flashed in his narrowed eyes.

These were Origin Condensing Pills produced after Yang Kai's refinements, and they used formulas provided by the Spiritual Pill workshop; in terms of quality they were beyond reproach, even somewhat better than the Origin Condensing Pills the Spiritual Pill workshop had previously sold.

Jin Fugui was after all a Third Stage of the Void King Realm, long accustomed to dealings with Spiritual Pills — how could he not discern such differences?

He was secretly alarmed, realizing the origin of Yang Kai's batch was likely extraordinary.

For a time the side room fell silent, only Jin's hand tapping the table over and over, as if weighing something.

After a long while he said, "There is no complaint about the quality of your Origin Condensing Pills; how about I offer you this price?"

As he spoke, he gestured a price.

Yang Kai could not help scoffing, "Shopkeeper Jin, is that the price you put on my Origin Condensing Pills? If so, I would happily take them to another shop."

Jin Fugui coughed lightly and said, "Listen to me, sir — this batch is indeed top-grade, but a small shop needs manpower and labor to sell them; we cannot operate without making a profit, can we?"

"Shopkeeper Jin has a point," Yang Kai nodded. "But Origin Condensing Pills do not lack buyers — I would not even need a shop; if I shouted on the street they'd be snatched away. Are you sure you want to pass up this excellent money-making opportunity?"

Jin Fugui's face twitched; with determination he made another gesture and said, "Then how about this price!"

Yang Kai gave him a sidelong glance and said, "Five hundred per piece, and perhaps we'll have opportunity to cooperate again!"

Jin Fugui frowned at that, but he soon made up his mind. He stood and said, "Very well, we will proceed as you say. I hope that next time when you have Origin Condensing Pills you'll consider our shop first."

"Of course, of course," Yang Kai chuckled. "By the way, besides Origin Condensing Pills I have some other pills — Shopkeeper Jin, help me estimate them."

The other pills Yang Kai mentioned were those he had skimmed off while refining pills for disciples in the Biyu Sect; there were many and of various kinds, though their grade and desirability could not compare to Origin Condensing Pills.

Jin Fugui naturally didn’t trouble himself over such matters; to a black‑market merchant like him, so long as there was profit to be made, that was all that mattered.

After some counting, Jin Fugui took most of the Spiritual Pills from Yang Kai, and Yang Kai received nearly one hundred seventy thousand Source Crystals!

That sum finally gave Yang Kai some confidence.

After all, when he had spent a month refining pills for others in the Biyu Sect he had only earned thirty thousand Source Crystals.

And now, in only half a month, he had one hundred seventy thousand in income; the main reason was the high demand and expensive nature of Origin Condensing Pills.

Leaving Jin Fugui's shop, Yang Kai still wore his black robe covering his face; he did not hurry home but strolled through the black market.

Places like this could occasionally yield good finds, though the chances were slim — after all, there were few martial artists who could not recognize value, and it was extremely rare for someone to sell a treasure as junk.

Yang Kai walked a circuit but found nothing.

Just as he was preparing to head back, a charming yet somewhat familiar cry rang out from not far away, tinged with both anger and grievance: “Why are you all being so unreasonable!”

Yang Kai was taken aback; an innocent young girl's image immediately flashed before his eyes.

Impossible, he thought to himself, but he had not been in Fenglin City long and knew few people; the only voice that sounded familiar was that girl.

Curiosity piqued, he hurried in that direction.

Not far off, a crowd had gathered; many martial artists were pointing and gesturing toward the center of the square.

Yang Kai parted the crowd and peered inside.

For a moment his eyes nearly popped out.

At one side of the square, a girl in a jade-green long dress frowned, her brows drawn; she was slight, with a full chest and graceful figure, delicate features and fair skin. Most striking was the large crescent-shaped birthmark on her cheek. Several cloth pouches hung at her waist, bulging with unknown contents.

Mo Xiaoqi!

Yang Kai could hardly believe his eyes.

It was really Mo Xiaoqi, the innocent girl he had met on Yuqing Mountain.

She was still alive?

To be honest, seeing the youngster bouncing about oddly eased Yang Kai's heart; the guilt that had long weighed on him vanished in an instant.

That day on Yuqing Mountain, when the Divine Spirit flew into a rage and the black flames consumed the world, the land within a thousand li of Yuqing Mountain had been ravaged; Mo Xiaoqi had vanished. Yang Kai had assumed she was dead and had felt quite guilty.

Because if he had been close enough to Mo Xiaoqi, before the black flames arrived he could have pulled her into the Xuan Realm Pearl to hide.

Yet it was precisely that fleeting lapse of judgment that cost the innocent maiden her life, as she was swallowed by the raging wrath of Luan Feng.

At the time Yang Kai had indeed felt guilty; although they were not very close, she had made a good impression on him — there were few girls like her in the world.

Now seeing her again, Yang Kai felt joy but also wondered how she had managed to escape that place; Luan Feng's indiscriminate attack had been terrifying — without the Xuan Realm Pearl he himself would have been hard-pressed to survive.

But on closer thought, this girl's background was extremely mysterious and she wore a dazzling array of high-grade secret treasures; perhaps she had used the power of some treasure to survive.

Thinking that, Yang Kai's estimation of Mo Xiaoqi rose several degrees.

After all, a treasure capable of withstanding one of Luan Feng's furious strikes would at minimum be of Imperial Treasure grade; Mo Xiaoqi possessing an Imperial Treasure suggested her background might be unimaginably significant.

Yet at this moment the girl with such a great background was trapped in trouble.

Opposite her, a group of martial artists circled a youth like planets around the moon; the youth looked elegant and handsome, but his lecherous eyes kept sweeping over Mo Xiaoqi, especially her ample bosom which drew his gaze.

But when he shifted his gaze to Mo Xiaoqi's face, his expression turned to one of profound pity, as if cursing the creator's injustice — his look filled with a plaintive cry of blood and tears to heaven!
