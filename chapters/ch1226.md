## Chapter 1226 — Days Like Years

It was a soul-energy presence, hidden with utter perfection—so perfect that even Yang Kai's Divine Sense failed to detect it as it approached; if not for the chance discovery aided by the Zhaoxing Pearl's power, he might have been successfully ambushed.

The instant he perceived that soul-energy, Yang Kai retaliated.

To his surprise, the other's Divine Sense cultivation was in no way inferior to his own. When the two wills collided invisibly, Yang Kai suffered a slight loss, and the other was likewise not in great shape.

After that incident, Lu Ye immediately retracted his Divine Sense and feigned nonchalance. It was Yang Kai's muffled groan, however, that drew everyone's attention.

As Qu Changfeng drove people away, Lu Ye's expression fluctuated uneasily. Once many of the weaker factions were driven off, he too had no choice but to leave; after all, he was the only practitioner from Liu Yun Gorge here, and Qu Changfeng would not bother with the Gorge—staying would only make him look ridiculous.

There was something wrong with this Lu Ye.

Yang Kai reckoned that if not for his earlier stroke of fortune obtaining the Warm Spirit Lotus, he could never possess such powerful Divine Sense. How many Warm Spirit Lotuses could there be in the world? Even if there were others, it was unlikely one would be in the hands of a cultivator like Lu Ye.

That Lu Ye's Divine Sense equaled his own was puzzling indeed.

Liu Yun Gorge was not a particularly strong force on Dark Star, only middling; the sect would not possess miraculous methods to temper Divine Sense to such an extent. How had Lu Ye refined his Divine Sense to this level?

At the Stalactite Cave earlier, Yang Kai had found nothing peculiar about Lu Ye. He had been an ordinary Third Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivator. Though Lu Ye had also bathed in the Soul Cleansing Divine Water and gained something, it was far too little to cause such a change.

The sudden appearance of such a powerful adversary left Yang Kai deeply vexed; he did not even know what had provoked Lu Ye.

He resolved to find an opportunity to eliminate him. Whether Lu Ye's hostility was a misunderstanding or not, being watched by a person like that left one no peace.

Thoughts entangled in his mind, Yang Kai soon made his decision. He took a light breath and ceased dwelling on Lu Ye, closing his eyes to continue his comprehension. The second sun's rise intensified the fruit's aroma, and the wonders contained within that scent grew stronger. Everyone remaining would not waste such a rare chance and gladly sat to meditate and recuperate.

Yang Kai was still immersed in his comprehension of how to control Saint Yuan. He knew that the time one could gain enlightenment from the fragrance released by the maturing Red Candle Fruit was brief. Therefore, he had no intention of delving into something as profound as the laws of space. If within these mere two or three days he could thoroughly grasp the control of Saint Yuan, the trip would be more than worthwhile.

He did not know what others would choose, but he believed his decision was correct.

When the second sun reached the zenith and ceased moving, a layer of dark-red energy spread through the valley. Many experts who had experienced this twice before took it in stride, though their excitement and intense expressions could not be concealed.

The dark-red energy's appearance meant the third sun would soon rise, forming the marvel of Three Suns Rising—and it also signaled the Red Candle Fruit's true ripening!

Some impatient, unstable cultivators could not remain calm; they opened their eyes and stared wide, watching every movement in the valley so as not to miss a single thing.

The sudden emergence of the dark-red energy made the earth tremble; soon the energy erupted and thundered outward, and the fruit scent in the air thickened threefold.

Under countless eyes, the third sun rose as expected.

A faint murmur rose; Saint Yuan stirred subtly, and some seemed ready to dash forward.

Li Younan of the Medicine Pill Sect, wiping the sweat from his brow, called out loudly, "Do not act rashly! The Three Suns Rising spectacle hasn't fully formed yet; the Red Candle Fruit hasn't surfaced—do not fight now. If you disturb its ripening, even if we die ten thousand deaths we couldn't atone!"

He believed he knew the fruit's secrets and pre-ripening signs better than anyone present, and thus felt duty-bound to warn them.

Inwardly he cursed—if not for fear that they would lose control and ruin the fruit's maturation through fighting, he would have said nothing. Their deaths would only benefit his Medicine Pill Sect, allowing them to monopolize the miraculous fruit.

Hearing Li Younan, many cast him cold, indifferent glances. Those who needed to stay alert still stayed alert, and those who were gathering Saint Yuan continued to do so.

On the Yingyue Hall side, Wei Guchang narrowed his eyes, thought there remained time, and closed them again to continue his comprehension, not showing any extreme impatience.

As time passed the atmosphere around the small valley grew tenser. When the third sun had risen half its way, many who had been meditating could no longer restrain themselves; they rose to their feet and watched the sun's movement closely—this included famed rising talents like Wei Guchang, Qu Changfeng, Fang Tianzhong, Yin Sudie, Tang Yongyi, Qu Minghai, and the like.

No one could maintain prior indifference; these people watched the sun's ascent and spoke low to those beside them, faces grave and serious.

"Junior Brother Yang is still in comprehension!" Daiyuan's expression flashed with astonishment as she looked at Yang Kai, sitting motionless while Saint Yuan raged within him.

Yang Kai was clearly at a crucial point in his insight, too absorbed to bother with the fruit's ripening.

"Seems Brother Yang gains much this time," Wei Guchang said with a wry smile, envious; though he had meditated a day or two, his attention had been pulled to check the fruit and he had not achieved concrete results—only vague benefits, far less than Yang Kai.

"There's another person also comprehending!" Xuan'er cast her gaze to another hill where a cold, indifferent man from the Star Emperor Sect mirrored Yang Kai exactly—sitting cross-legged, expression still, yet Saint Yuan within him churned fiercely.

"This is perhaps our difference with them," Wei Guchang murmured. A prodigy who rose to fame early and hailed as Yingyue Hall's brightest star, comparable to Fang Tianzhong and Qu Changfeng, he had never felt inferior—until witnessing Yang Kai's techniques, and the emergence of the Star Emperor Sect disciple made him feel a vague crisis.

He realized that if he did not work harder, the Dark Star might someday not have room for him.

Dozens of cultivators stood on hillocks around the valley, concentrating on the third sun. Yang Kai and that Star Emperor Sect disciple's actions thus drew attention.

Yang Kai's origins remained unknown to most, and a First Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivator would normally be disregarded by these elites.

Yet the cold, indifferent Star Emperor Sect man persisted in his comprehension, prompting silent relief among many; they secretly hoped he would continue to comprehend until the fruit's fate was determined.

People truly felt time passing like years.

Since the third sun rose it moved as slowly as a crawling tortoise, and everyone longed to rush forward and push it to the top.

This state lasted an entire day's worth of effort. When the third sun reached the zenith and joined the other two, forming the Three Suns Rising spectacle, the three suns resonated and suddenly burst with blinding light, casting the Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland into a darkness that forced all remaining cultivators to close their eyes.

A tumult of energy waves spread from the sky. When they opened their eyes, all were shocked.

For the three suns had merged into one larger sun, spinning like a top; with each rotation it exerted an unparalleled gravitational pull.

The world's Spiritual Qi grew abnormal.

It surged together toward that place, and the dense Spiritual Qi condensed into substance, forming gale winds that were crazily poured into the sun, which swallowed the Qi like a bottomless maw.

Li Younan of Medicine Pill Sect trembled, eyes wide as he stared at the scene, nearly beside himself with excitement!

Exactly as the texts recorded—no deviation; the Red Candle Fruit had indeed ripened!

Within the span of an incense stick, the Spiritual Qi of the entire Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland drained away, and hundreds of li around became a dead void!

The sun, however, grew more solid, hanging like a small true sun in the sky.

Suddenly it ceased spinning, transitioning from frenetic motion to absolute stillness in an instant.

"Not good!" Li Younan broke out in a cold sweat and hastily produced a shield-like secret treasure; the shield became a streak of light, forming a water-like defensive dome over his Medicine Pill Sect comrades' hillock, sealing them within tight protection.
