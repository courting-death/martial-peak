## Chapter 1986 — I Am Not to Be Trifled With

"Why are you people being unreasonable? I called dibs on this first, and I already paid the Source Crystals — why should it go to you?" Mo Xiaoqi said, one hand clutching something she kept behind her rear, her full chest thrust forward as she faced a dozen burly men without a trace of fear.

"Miss, you can't talk like that. Since our Young Master has set his eyes on it, he must have it. Whatever Source Crystals you paid, we'll pay you double — please hand the item over and spare us any trouble," a man opposite snorted coldly; his voice swelled with force, the threat in his tone plain to hear.

"Do I care about your Source Crystals?" Mo Xiaoqi pouted, then glanced at an elderly man beside her and asked, "Tell me — didn't I buy this from you first?"

The old man, clearly the seller, wore a worried expression; hearing her he glanced at Mo Xiaoqi, then at the dozen fierce-looking men opposite, and emitted a strained, nervous chuckle. "Maybe… yes!"

"What do you mean maybe?" Mo Xiaoqi stared at him in astonishment. "Did I not give you the Source Crystals? I even gave you a little extra just now — you thanked me for it."

The old man twitched the corner of his mouth and fell silent.

The young man, who had been the focal point surrounded by numerous martial artists, suddenly let out a light laugh and looked at the old man. "Old man, how many Source Crystals did this young lady give you?"

The old man showed a pained look and, after hesitating, said in a low voice, "Eight thousand."

"Eight thousand, huh — not much." The youth grinned. "I'll give ten thousand. Old man, sell it to me, how about that?"

"Ten thousand?" The seller's face lit up and he nodded repeatedly. "All right, all right…" But then his expression turned troubled and he added, "But the item has already been sold to this young lady…"

"What's the problem? In business the highest bidder wins." The youth laughed heartily and looked at Mo Xiaoqi. "Miss, you heard that — old man's item is mine for ten thousand Source Crystals. Please hand it over…"

"Highest bidder wins?" Mo Xiaoqi ground her teeth in anger and cut him off before he finished: "Fine, I'll pay twenty thousand."

Hearing that, the seller was stunned and overjoyed — he had never expected his wares to fetch such a high price. He also felt some regret that something so fine had been sold off like a common trinket; it had been a great bargain for whoever had bought it.

The youth's brows tightened, a vicious look flashing across his face. "I'll give thirty thousand. Think you can outbid me?"

"Fifty thousand!" Mo Xiaoqi tossed the number off casually, like an invisible hammer striking down and instantly making the youth look diminished.

The youth's eyes bared white with fury as he snarled, "You little bitch. Do you know who I am? How dare you fight me for something!"

"How would I know who you are?" Mo Xiaoqi replied with loathing. "Besides, you're the one trying to take it from me. You're being unreasonable."

"All right, all right, you little bitch — won't learn till you see a coffin. I'll make you die and understand. I am Ning Yuancheng, the Young Palace Lord of Fei Sheng Palace. Smart ones will leave the item and get lost; for the stupid ones… heh heh heh, I'll take both the person and the thing!"

Ning Yuancheng sneered coldly, his gaze roaming over Mo Xiaoqi with unmistakable ill intent.

"Fei Sheng Palace!"

"Is that Ning Yuancheng?"

"This girl is in deep trouble."

As Ning Yuancheng finished speaking, Mo Xiaoqi had not yet reacted, but the onlookers' faces all changed.

After all, Fei Sheng Palace, though not among the very top powers in the Southern Territory and nowhere near comparable to the Tianwu Sacred Land, Wuhua Hall or Qingyang Shrine, still had some reputation — far beyond the petty sects around Fenglin City.

As the Young Palace Lord of Fei Sheng Palace, Ning Yuancheng's renown was not small; at least in this part of the Southern Territory his name was familiar to many.

Recently, because of the Luanfeng's appearance, many forces had gone to Yuqing Mountain to investigate; Fei Sheng Palace was no exception, and the one leading their contingent was, unsurprisingly, Young Palace Lord Ning Yuancheng.

They had gone into Yuqing Mountain and found nothing, and were stopping in Fenglin City on their way back — who would have thought they'd run into such a scene in this black market?

Ning Yuancheng wore a smug expression, certain that by dropping his name and the backing of his sect the insolent woman before him would apologize, perhaps even throw herself at him to beg forgiveness.

Hmph — though the girl's large birthmark detracts from her looks, her figure is certainly something; those ample breasts in particular would be a real treat to toy with.

Once the lights were out at night and clothes came off, there'd be no difference.

"Fei Sheng Palace? Never heard of it." Mo Xiaoqi's brows drew together as she looked puzzled.

Ning Yuancheng's smug expression froze instantly, and the Fei Sheng Palace cultivators with him all fell silent and darkened.

"Bold scoundrel, how dare you insult the Palace! Seize her for me — I'll make her learn what Fei Sheng Palace means!" Ning Yuancheng barked, his face vicious as he issued the order.

The dozen Void King Realm cultivators did not hesitate and moved in.

Fenglin City was a small town; even the city lord was only of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm and the two deputy city lords were merely of the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm — three Dao Origin Realm cultivators in total — so they were nothing in the eyes of Fei Sheng Palace. In this lawless black market, or even out on the streets, Fei Sheng Palace would dare to act.

What could the city lord's mansion do? Could it really oppose Fei Sheng Palace?

Ten or so men surged forward; three of them moved fastest and instantaneously closed in on Mo Xiaoqi, two flanking her to grab her delicate shoulders while one thrust a palm toward her belly.

Strength swelled at each of their palms.

At least they knew their Young Master's order was to seize, not kill, so each held back in their strikes.

The onlookers gasped, many wearing looks of sympathy.

A group of big men ganging up on a little girl — even though she was of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, people still felt pity.

Yang Kai also turned away with discomfort, clicking his tongue a few times.

His unease was not aimed at Mo Xiaoqi so much as at the Fei Sheng Palace men who had moved first toward her.

Their encounter at Yuqing Mountain had left a deep impression on Yang Kai…

Even his formidable body—tempered by training in the Undying Five Elements Sword and fortified with countless Hun Yuan Pills—was pierced until his hands ran with blood when he came into contact with Mo Xiaoqi. Needless to say, those ignorant brutes would fare even worse.

Besides, Yang Kai had only intended to grab Mo Xiaoqi and take her away with him that day at Yuqing Mountain, he had not used force; now these men were striking in anger — the consequences…

"Ah…"

As expected, a string of screams rose up, making the onlookers freeze; when they saw how the situation in the ring had changed, their jaws nearly dropped.

The two men who reached to grab Mo Xiaoqi's shoulders cried out as soon as they touched her and were thrown backward, palms gushing blood and flesh mangled — the wounds were deep enough to reveal bone, a grisly sight.

The man who slapped at Mo Xiaoqi's belly fared worst; though she was shaken by the blow, he screamed and staggered backward, his palm burning with pain.

Looking down, an imprint of a human face had appeared on his palm for some reason, the features twisted in a howl that seemed able to pierce the Sea of Consciousness.

Instantly, the man's mind froze; inside his Sea of Consciousness a huge ghostly visage burst forth — blue-faced, fanged, with a blood-gaping maw that devoured his Divine Sense like a sweet spring. The ghastly face wore an expression of perverse delight.

He was utterly incapable of resisting; the light in his eyes dimmed rapidly.

"What?" Ning Yuancheng shouted, stunned by the scene.

Everything before him exceeded his comprehension.

His three subordinates had attacked Mo Xiaoqi, and she had remained standing, looking panicked and unsure how to fight back; yet without her lifting a hand his men were the ones badly injured.

Two wounded and one dead — such a result blinded him with shock.

What sort of secret art was this?

Was the girl playing dumb while hiding real power?

Or was she some ancient hag who had concealed millennia of cultivation and was now feigning innocence?

All manner of thoughts crowded Ning Yuancheng's mind and soaked his back with cold sweat.

"Retreat!" At that moment, the remaining men who had rushed in were halted by a sharp order.

The others reacted quickly, seeing the danger and not daring to press the attack; they retreated in fear.

A man with a sullen face stepped out from behind Ning Yuancheng. He looked middle-aged and had stood silently behind Ning Yuancheng until now; his expression was calm and untroubled as he slowly moved forward to stand before the Young Palace Lord.

As the Young Palace Lord of Fei Sheng Palace, he naturally had one or two formidable experts accompanying him.

This man was Liu Yizhi, a Fei Sheng Palace master of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm charged with protecting Ning Yuancheng.

As a Dao Origin Realm Second Stage expert, his vision was exceptional and he immediately judged Mo Xiaoqi to be of extraordinary origin. It had been he who realized the danger and called off his disciples.

He quietly interposed himself before Ning Yuancheng, sealing off any angle from which an attack might come, and looked at Mo Xiaoqi with grave, probing eyes as if to examine her from within out.

"You… you… what are you trying to do?" Mo Xiaoqi, shaken out of her daze, cried out in a trembling yet fierce voice, "Don't come any closer — I'm not someone to be messed with, watch out… watch out or I'll hit you!"

The crowd could not help but roll their eyes.

Isn't it obvious that she's not someone to be trifled with? Must she really tell them?
