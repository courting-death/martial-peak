## Chapter 952 — Mortals in Carnage

Outside the Nine Peaks, Yang Kai personally escorted the Hu Family sisters and the two pavilion masters of the Twin Pavilion away.

Wu Fa and Wu Tian walked ahead, while Yang Kai trailed a few paces behind with Hu Jiao'er and Hu Mei'er, carefully reminding them of several matters.

The two sisters had only recently arrived in this world, and now they were headed elsewhere; there were indeed a few things they needed to be mindful of.

Jiao'er and Mei'er nodded continuously, wearing obedient expressions.

After speaking for a long time, Yang Kai halted and said, “This is as far as I go. When you get there keep a low profile and try not to cause trouble. If anyone mistreats you, come back to find me and I’ll help you get justice.”

“Oh…” Hu Mei'er seemed a little reluctant to part.

Hu Jiao'er pressed her delicate body against him and reached out to pinch the flesh of Yang Kai’s vest at the back.

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai regarded her with a face of indifference, staring at her in surprise.

“You actually called us the little sisters next door…” Hu Jiao’er bit down on her silver teeth. “Meier is one thing—she’s younger than you, so calling her your little sister makes sense. But what about me… should this auntie here start calling you Brother Yang instead?”

She struck an alluring pose, her voice syrupy and coquettish, every motion drenched in flirtation; Yang Kai felt his heart stir and nodded without restraint. “All right.”

“Could you be any more shameless?” Hu Jiao'er laughed and cried at once.

By age, she was older than Yang Kai.

It was only that she and her sister looked so alike that anyone unaware would mistake them for twins.

“Isn’t that just more convenient when making introductions? Besides, saying it that way also raises your status. As long as you understand in your heart, why take it so seriously?” Yang Kai’s expression was helpless.

“I know what you mean.” Hu Jiao’er let go of his hand, her expression suddenly turning wistful as she said with a playful smile, “If I really had a big brother next door like you, that wouldn’t be so bad!”

Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment.

While he hesitated, the Hu sisters had already quickened their pace and joined Wu Fa and Wu Tian.

The two pavilion masters of the Twin Pavilion turned and cupped their fists. “Saint Lord Yang, we take our leave. You need not worry about the two young ladies’ safety. As long as the two of us are alive, no one will be able to bully them.”

“Thank you, pavilion masters.” Yang Kai returned the salute with a serious expression.

Jiao'er and Mei'er exchanged a glance, and for reasons unknown to him they suddenly raised their hands and called out in sweet voices, “Goodbye, Brother Yang. We’ll miss you.”

Their figures receded into the distance.

Staring blankly in the direction they had gone, Yang Kai stood frozen for a long while before shivering and feeling a chill all over; he hurried back to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land to seek warmth from his Little Senior Sister.

Ten days later, all arrangements were in order.

At the War Soul Hall, forces from the Great Han coexisted peacefully; the initial construction work had finished, and only time was needed for them to become familiar with this world.

Within the Sacred Land, Yang Kai no longer needed to worry over many matters—Elder Xu Hui had taken care of things very well.

Bidding farewell to everyone, Yang Kai set out alone toward the Ice Sect.

He intended to fetch Su Yan back so she could reunite with the sect.

He hadn’t taken anyone with him on this trip; Li Rong and Han Fei wanted to accompany him, but Yang Kai refused.

Taking a beauty along to find one’s woman—what kind of show would that be? Even if Su Yan were magnanimous and not jealous, Yang Kai would still feel embarrassed.

So he firmly denied Li Rong and Han Fei’s request to go with him.

Yang Kai wasn’t sure how to reach the Ice Sect, so he planned to make a stop at the Water Divine Hall and use it as a waypoint to find the Ice Sect.

In the sky, a flicker of azure light swept across a hundred li in an instant. Yang Kai stood atop the Flying Shuttle, gliding forward at a swift yet unhurried pace.

Crossing lofty mountains and vast rivers, Yang Kai drew ever closer to the Water Divine Hall, and his heart grew all the more stirred with excitement.

The closer he drew to Su Yan, the more a feeling arose in him akin to the timid unease of returning home.

He didn’t know what Su Yan’s cultivation was now, but judging by her talent and the local training environment, she should not be weaker than him.

Years ago, when he had chased after her and Xia Ningshang to Tongxuan Continent, the only thought in Yang Kai’s mind had been to find them both as quickly as possible.

He had never expected such a simple wish would take ten years to fulfill.

Back then he never imagined he would achieve what he had today.

With a cultivation at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm and True Yuan transformed into Saint, he sat as the master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, commanding the Ancient Demon Clan and secretly bearing the identity of the Dragon Emperor.

Aside from a little room for improvement in strength, Yang Kai had already established himself at the pinnacle of this world—an absolute overlord in his domain.

Increasing his power any further was merely a matter of time.

When he first arrived here he’d been like someone from a mountain village who knew nothing, trailing behind Yun Xuan and others of the Duao Alliance, silently observing the world with his own eyes, lone and without support, awed by the alliance’s strength.

Yet now, forces like the Duao Alliance could be destroyed at his word; the alliance leader Yun Cheng was proud simply to have any connection to him.

With his thoughts turning over, Yang Kai shook his head and chuckled to himself.

Suddenly, a panicked shout rose from below; many martial artists were rushing in his direction, their faces filled with horror as they glanced back constantly, as if some pursuit hunted them.

Yang Kai frowned and slowed his speed.

He had no idea what had happened below to send so many fleeing in terror.

Thirty li ahead lay a city—Shuilan City. Yang Kai had once come here in search of Su Yan and knew it was territory under the Water Divine Hall.

Looking down, Shuilan City was enveloped in smoke and chaos; fowl and beasts scattered, and the air was filled with cries of agony and screams of terror.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened as he vanished in a flash of green light.

Moments later he reappeared above Shuilan City; gazing down, his eyes contracted.

The entire city was a living hell—blood stained the streets, severed limbs and torn flesh lay everywhere; the scene was too gruesome to behold.

Yang Kai was bewildered, unable to comprehend what calamity could have turned a city into a Shura battlefield.

This was the domain of the Water Divine Hall—surely they wouldn’t ignore such a thing?

Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai immediately sensed several unusual phenomena.

In many places across the city, a violent, murderous aura surged forth—familiar and unmasked—its density chilling to the bone.

Looking toward the nearest source, Yang Kai froze on the spot.

There stood a skeleton, its bones stained red, and a soft trickling sound like flowing water seemed to come from within it as if blood still moved through its frame.

Two eye sockets burned with a green, ghostly fire that sent a shiver down the spine.

Around the skeleton lay many slain martial artists; an inexplicable attraction emanated from the bones—corpse and flesh visibly condensed into streams of pure essence, being rapidly absorbed by the skeleton.

After devouring the flesh and blood essence of the dead, a thin layer of flesh faintly covered the skeleton’s surface.

It looked like a skin-and-bones corpse that had been peeled alive, an image that chilled the mind.

Yang Kai cried out in alarm, “Bone Race?”

This skeleton revealed abundant vitality; it was clearly a member of the Bone Race, though different from those he had encountered in the Ice Sect and the Tianxiao Sect.

It seemed to have truly come back to life.

A powerful aura of the First Stage of the Saint Realm radiated from its body.

Yang Kai groaned inwardly, unable to explain the bizarre phenomenon before him.

While he stood stunned, the Bone Race creature suddenly turned its head to look at him, its ghostly green eyes locking onto him with a murderous Divine Sense.

Then it split open its blood-stained maw, revealing what might be a smile.

A coldness washed over Yang Kai as he finally understood why Shuilan City’s residents had fled in such panic; anyone who saw that scene would be stricken with terror.

Moreover, the city’s inhabitants were not particularly strong, while this Bone Race member was at least a Saint Realm expert.

Shuilan City held more than this single Bone Race presence; through his Divine Sense Yang Kai detected at least four or five violent auras scattered in different corners.

His sudden arrival seemed to pique the Bone Race member’s interest; after staring at him for a time it began to walk straight toward him.

Though it clearly had no skin, the ground it passed over remained unnaturally clean; the blood that flowed across its frame did not spill or stain the earth.

Halfway there, the Bone Race creature suddenly turned into a streak of bloodlight and vanished.

At that moment Yang Kai’s alarm bells rang; True Yuan rushed forth from his body as he thrust a palm out.

A colossal palm strike, like a collapsing mountain, swept forward; the Heaven-Covering Palm struck where the vanished Bone Race creature had been, revealing its form.

Drops of gem-like blood splattered from it; the newly formed flesh that had begun to cover its bones was blasted away, exposing blood-red bones.

The Bone Race creature was momentarily stunned, its ghostly green eyes flickering faster as if surprised that Yang Kai had managed to stop it.

Its aura grew markedly more furious; it opened its mouth in a howl like a ghost wailing or wolf howling. The cry hit Yang Kai like a hammer, causing violent waves to churn within his Sea of Consciousness.

The howl contained a formidable spirit attack.

Yang Kai’s face turned cold as a brilliant golden spear appeared in his hand; he hurled it viciously forward.

Whoosh…

The Heaven-Slaying Spear became a streak of gold and thundered through the Bone Race creature’s gaping maw, exiting out the back of its skull.

A transparent hole was punched through; Yang Kai stood before it, able to see through the cavity to whatever lay beyond.

The creature paid no heed; the thin flesh around its neck writhed grotesquely and the wound quickly mended as if no penetration had ever occurred.

A heavy unease settled over Yang Kai as his mood grew grave.
