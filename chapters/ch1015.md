## Chapter 1015 — You still have such means?

Ghost Ancestor hoisted Yang Kai, his expression strange as he stared at He Zao.

He Zao was clearly terrified to death, her delicate body trembling violently, yet she still refused to avert her gaze from the Ghost Ancestor.

Everyone was astonished.

Yue Xi covered her mouth and whispered sharply, “What are you doing? Sit down and behave yourself!”

He Zao did not move; she could not sit. Under the Ghost Ancestor’s coercive presence she hadn’t the strength to so much as twitch a finger, drenched in fragrant sweat, her face as pale as paper.

Suddenly, Ghost Ancestor let out a few strange chuckles and asked Yang Kai, “What is your relationship with this girl?”

“A chance encounter!”

“So she fell in love with you at first sight?”

“I don’t think so.” Yang Kai shook his head, looking at He Zao standing there, his mood complicated.

“Then why did she stand up for you?” Ghost Ancestor smiled more oddly.

“H-He once saved my sister and me!” He Zao’s trembling voice rang out in response to Ghost Ancestor’s question.

“Hm, not bad! You young girl have a clear sense of gratitude… However, if I spare him, would you be willing to take his place?” Ghost Ancestor grinned evilly at He Zao.

He Zao’s face grew even paler, her body trembling, as if for a moment she could not give an answer.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but cast his eyes toward her, wanting to know how she would respond.

Lü Guichen and Bi Ya and the others all stared at He Zao in tacit disbelief, while Yue Xi kept signaling her with glances, urging her not to act rashly.

He Zao drew a deep breath, her bright eyes turning resolute in an instant, as if she had made up her mind.

She parted her lips, about to give her answer.

“No need,” Yang Kai frowned. “Senior, you don’t have to concern yourself with her—go ahead.”

Ghost Ancestor was momentarily stunned. He cast a thoughtful glance at Yang Kai, then nodded and said, “At least you’ve got some backbone—not relying on a woman to share your danger. Hmph, no need to rush, none of you are getting away this time. Every last one of you is going in!”

At those words, everyone’s faces fell.

They had assumed this time would be like before: Ghost Ancestor might throw one person into the Void Passage to probe, and if Yang Kai died they could eke out a little more time. They believed doom would not fall on them so quickly, but things were not as they had imagined.

It was obvious Ghost Ancestor intended to burn his boats and fight to the end.

Realizing this, everyone’s expressions turned bitter. They quietly felt there was no escaping this time and feared they would truly die here, following the fate of those who had died before them.

Even the seven-colored sky turned overcast at that moment, weighing heavily on their hearts.

“Brother Yang, go well on your way; I’ll come to join you shortly. I promise you won’t be alone!” Shen Tu, on the verge of death, still managed to bid Yang Kai farewell.

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“Kid, go in!” Ghost Ancestor, unwilling to waste time, released a strand of resentful soul that coiled around Yang Kai’s body and, with a flick, flung him into the Void Passage.

As he sensed the information reflected back from the resentful soul on that side, he spread his hand and pulled He Zao over, sneering, “Little girl, don’t be impatient. I’ll send you to accompany your lifesaver—may you have luck, unlike those before who died without explanation!”

“Old monster, you have committed countless evils; one day someone will make you pay!” He Zao bit her teeth and shouted.

“No need to trouble yourself!” Ghost Ancestor paid her no mind and likewise released a strand of resentful soul to entangle He Zao.

Just as he prepared to toss He Zao into the Void Passage, his body stiffened; his eerie eyes suddenly fixed on the corridor, his expression electrified as if he had discovered something special.

In the next instant, he suddenly let out a sharp roar. “Brat, you actually had such an ability?”

As he spoke, casting aside He Zao, he laughed loudly and vanished.

From a very great distance, his brazen laughter echoed back.

On the mountainside, He Zao stood there ashen-faced, motionless, staring blankly in the direction Ghost Ancestor had departed, clueless as to what had occurred.

He Miao hurried up, tears brimming in her eyes, anxiously asking, “Sister, are you all right?”

“I’m fine.” He Zao shook her head; aside from being chilled by the strand of resentful soul that covered her, there was nothing else wrong.

The Ghost Ancestor had not done anything else to her.

“What happened? Why did that old monster suddenly leave?” Yue Xi also rushed over.

Lü Guichen, Bi Ya, Shen Tu and the others all moved closer, their gazes fixed on He Zao, hoping she could provide an explanation.

Everyone assumed that since she had stood beside Ghost Ancestor, she must have noticed some clue.

“I don’t know.” He Zao shook her head.

“You really don’t know?” Lü Guichen asked, distrustful.

“I really don’t know!”

“That is odd—why did the senior suddenly depart?”

“Could it have something to do with Yang Kai?” He Miao asked innocently. “That old fellow’s parting words were clearly directed at Yang Kai.”

Upon that reminder, they all suddenly recalled and pondered deeply, finding it very plausible. It seemed Yang Kai possessed some extraordinary means that had piqued Ghost Ancestor’s interest.

But at that moment Yang Kai had already been hurled into the Void Passage—so why would Ghost Ancestor pursue him?

“Has that old fellow gone mad?” Shen Tu’s mouth twitched; only madness could explain Ghost Ancestor’s strange actions.

“Let’s just hope he doesn’t remember us,” Lü Guichen murmured, half in denial, as if trying to convince himself.

Somewhere on the Floating Continent, space suddenly tore open and Yang Kai’s figure emerged.

Glancing around, Yang Kai’s face darkened and he could not help cursing.

He discovered he was still on that bizarre continent.

Before he could catch his breath, Ghost Ancestor’s aura rushed toward him like thunder. In the blink of an eye Yang Kai saw a pitch-black silhouette charging from afar, and even before the figure reached him, swathes of bloodthirsty resentful souls had already poured forth from Ghost Ancestor’s body, claws bared as they lunged.

Yang Kai’s expression changed; he tore the void again and dove into the spatial eddies.

When he reappeared, he was already a thousand li away!

Ghost Ancestor lunged and came up short; after a quick sense, he pinpointed Yang Kai’s new location and continued the chase with a feral grin.

“Brat, you hid yourself well—but no matter what you do, you’ll never escape the palm of this old master’s hand!” Ghost Ancestor gave chase relentlessly, determined to capture Yang Kai.

Yang Kai kept fleeing, his heart bitter as gall.

A year ago, when Ghost Ancestor first chose him, Yang Kai had concealed his ability to rend the void; he had not hesitated to expend the ten-year-cultivated Soul Incarnation to hide the technique.

He had regarded it as a last-ditch method of survival, secretly hoping he could tear space to leave this ghostly place, return to the Chaos Abyss, and free himself from Ghost Ancestor’s control.

Only when forced to use it today did he realize how naive that hope had been.

It seemed Ghost Ancestor had constructed a spatial formation here and, through constant experimentation, left the continent’s spatial field in chaos, making the spatial eddies more perilous and strange than ever.

Even with Yang Kai’s understanding of space, he dared not linger long in the seams of space.

That meant under Ghost Ancestor’s pursuit he had no time to catch his breath.

Otherwise he could have hidden in the spatial eddies until Ghost Ancestor assumed he was dead, then moved stealthily.

Now he could only keep tearing through space again and again, fleeing in utter disarray as Ghost Ancestor pursued him relentlessly.

Each rending of the void consumed enormous corporeal strength and vast Divine Sense energy; after three or five attempts Yang Kai was already gasping for air.

His physical reserves were plentiful—if exhausted, the Divine Tree could supply him—but replenishing Divine Sense was not so convenient.

Yang Kai grew increasingly despairing, feeling there was no escape.

“Kid, don’t run. As long as you remain on this continent, you won’t get away!” Ghost Ancestor’s voice, though distant, sounded clear in Yang Kai’s ear.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, continued tearing space, and vanished several hundred li away.

Ghost Ancestor’s voice kept ringing in his ears.

“Kid, don’t refuse a cordial offer only to force punishment. If you run again, when I catch you I will make you pay!”

“Damn it, you’re set on opposing me; I’ll see how long you can hold out!”

“I know you’re flagging—you’re only a First Stage of the Saint Realm. After tearing space so many times, how much strength do you have left? Surrender obediently and I won’t make things hard for you.”

“All right, all right, stop—if you cease, I won’t pursue. I swear by Heaven I won’t touch a hair on your head; I keep my word!”

His tone and words slowly shifted, as if Ghost Ancestor found Yang Kai’s conduct beyond his expectations, and his confidence began to waver.

Yang Kai’s expression changed; he halted his flight and seized the chance to swallow a few pills that replenish Divine Sense, and drank some Wan Yao Ling Milk, allowing his nearly drained Sea of Consciousness to be quickly refilled.

The next moment Ghost Ancestor’s figure appeared, looming tens of zhang away from Yang Kai, gloomily regarding him with hatred.

He grinned, “Kid, you truly surprise at every turn; I never expected you had such means.”

“There are many things you can’t imagine.” Yang Kai tore space, hiding half his body in the rip, ready to bolt at any moment.

“Don’t be so tense—let’s talk.” Ghost Ancestor raised both hands and wore a benign smile, appearing harmless. “I have seen your method, but do you think I truly cannot stop you? Don’t forget, I have studied spatial laws for over a thousand years!”

“If you have this ability, why haven’t you used it before? What are you concerned about?” Yang Kai asked calmly.

Ghost Ancestor sneered, “If I truly wanted to stop you, I could. Whether what I catch is dead or alive I cannot guarantee, so I let you run wild—don’t be too conceited.”
