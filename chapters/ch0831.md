## Chapter 831 — I Give You Power

Outside Dragon Valley, all the high officials of Dragon‑Phoenix Palace gathered, their faces bright with excitement as they looked toward the valley's bottom.

Palace Master Chen Zhou's expression was especially animated, a smile never leaving his face.

Dragon‑Phoenix Palace differed from other forces: because they practiced a dual cultivation technique, almost every expert had a lifelong partner.

At this moment, Chen Zhou's partner, Yu Tingyi, stood at his side, lightly holding his hand while still unable to suppress the trembling of his towering frame.

Yu Tingyi appeared as a middle‑aged beauty with a full figure; her aptitude was slightly lacking so her cultivation trailed Chen Zhou by a step, presently only at Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm. Seeing her husband like this, she couldn't help but smile, "Calm down, it's just the inheritance reappearing — no need to be so worked up."

Chen Zhou drew a deep breath. "You don't understand! Generations of Palace Masters have treated the reappearance of the inheritance as the marker of succession; after so many years, it finally returned on my watch. How could I not be moved? If the inheritance truly reappears, our Palace will one day possess the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress again. With those two, we can restore our former glory..."

Saying that, he barked, "Has Xiao Ling not returned yet?"

As he asked, a figure shot in from afar; the voice reached them before the man: "Master, I'm back."

It was the Transcendent Realm man who had been following Chen Zhou earlier.

Chen Zhou hurried forward and asked, "What did you find out? Where is the disciple from? Is he a Palace disciple or from an affiliated family?"

"Master, the youth is Sun Yu — he's one of our Palace's own; he grew up within the Palace," Xiao Ling quickly replied.

Hearing that, Chen Zhou beamed and nodded repeatedly. "Good, very good!"

Even if Sun Yu had been born to an affiliated family, it wouldn't matter much, but if he had grown up inside Dragon‑Phoenix Palace, his loyalty to the Sect would be deep — that eased Chen Zhou's worries.

"Who was his teacher?"

"Elder Ling Jian!" Xiao Ling answered as he made way. "Elder Ling is here already!"

Chen Zhou looked up to see Ling Jian approaching with a broad smile.

After greetings, Chen Zhou said solemnly, "Elder Ling, you've worked hard to cultivate such a fine disciple."

Ling Jian's aged face lit up and he repeatedly demurred.

Though an elder, Ling Jian was only First Stage of the Transcendent Realm — low among the elders and often overlooked; with old age he mostly held the title and lived out his years.

He hadn't expected such a miraculous turn of events today.

His student had activated a sealing formation that had been closed for countless years; if all went well, the student might obtain the Dragon Emperor's inheritance.

If the disciple received the inheritance, the teacher who nurtured him would naturally rise in status.

In practical terms, once the Dragon Emperor matured, his standing could rival the Palace Master.

Normally Chen Zhou paid little attention to the elderly Ling Jian, but today he was careful not to be dismissive and spoke with considerable courtesy.

Ling Jian was momentarily unaccustomed but deeply gratified.

The Palace's elites watched enviously, their eyes reddening as they wondered why the opportunity to awaken the Dragon Emperor hadn't fallen to their own disciples.

If he had been one of their own, they'd already be feasting and joking with the Palace Master.

The festivities lasted many days without abating; Chen Zhou repeatedly questioned Sun Yu for details, and Ling Jian recounted Sun Yu's life from childhood to the present without holding back.

Chen Zhou listened not bored but shining with praise, calling Sun Yu a promising seed and saying the Palace's future would rest on him and Ling Jian.

Ling Jian felt immense satisfaction, thinking that even if he died now, he would die without regrets.

The lively scene continued for days; crowds gathered outside Dragon Valley each day, staring at the valley bottom yet seeing nothing. The valley was always shrouded in mist and sunlight seldom reached it, and now a streak of golden light covered it; terrifying energy fluctuations radiated from within, and no one dared approach.

Chen Zhou took precautions, dispatching all the Palace's elite to encircle Dragon Valley, to prevent anyone from disturbing Sun Yu as he received the inheritance.

Days passed and the crowd waited anxiously, but Sun Yu did not emerge from Dragon Valley, causing increasing worry.

……

Inside the world wrapped by the golden sea of energy, Yang Kai tinkered with his small pill furnace, adding various herbs and using Divine Sense Fire to refine pills, honing his craft and deepening his understanding of alchemy.

Now he was one step away from becoming a Saint‑Grade alchemist; with nothing else to do while waiting here, Yang Kai set about refining pills.

The youth Sun Yu, swept up in this incident, proved diligent; after living with Yang Kai for two or three days and learning they couldn't leave, he simply sat cross‑legged and cultivated.

The golden energy here was dense as substance but, oddly, did not feel merely Yang in nature — it carried a sacred, majestic quality.

Yang Kai couldn't precisely name the energy, but it could be used for cultivation without issue.

Moreover, the potency contained within that golden energy was terrifying; if Sun Yu absorbed even a little, it would benefit him for life.

One refined pills, one cultivated — days passed swiftly.

Yang Kai had no shortage of materials for alchemy; when he left the Nine Heavens Sacred Land he had cleared out their storeroom and packed the supplies into his Black Book Space, enough to last him a long while.

One day, just after Yang Kai finished refining a Saint‑Grade pill, he noticed Sun Yu had completed his cultivation and sat nearby staring at his hands without blinking, intently watching.

"Can you understand it?" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Sun Yu honestly shook his head and asked suspiciously, "Senior, your pill‑refining method is strange — it's nothing like the methods I've seen."

"Strange how?" Yang Kai asked.

"You don't use True Yuan... I've seen others refine pills and their True Yuan surges, consumed quickly, but your method seems to need no True Yuan at all, and it's much faster... What grade of pill did you just refine? A Mystery‑Grade pill?"

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai's expression darkened. He thought the boy didn't recognize what he had — he'd painstakingly refined a Saint‑Grade pill, yet in the kid's eyes it was reduced to a worthless Mystery‑Grade pill.

Sun Yu, reading the situation, blurted, "Could it be a Spirit‑Grade pill?"

"You could say that." Yang Kai didn't want to explain further.

"Senior, you're amazing... making a Spirit‑Grade pill in only an hour or two — if our Palace's alchemists knew, they'd be ashamed."

Flattery will always find its mark. Though Yang Kai had weathered much, he couldn't help feeling a little proud at Sun Yu's earnest admiration.

"Why aren't you cultivating?" Yang Kai put the Saint‑Grade pill away and asked.

Sun Yu replied with a sour face, "I can't absorb the energy here... I don't know why, and the two crystal stones I carried have been used up."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, believing him — though the energy was usable for cultivation, Sun Yu's foundation was still too weak.

Frowning as he measured him, Yang Kai suddenly asked, "Do you crave power?"

Sun Yu paused, then nodded solemnly.

"Why do you crave power?"

"Because I'm a man!" Sun Yu said matter‑of‑factly. "Of course I want power — I'll meet the woman I like someday, and without strength how can I protect her?"

Yang Kai laughed loudly. "Well said!"

Every man craves strength; no reason needed.

Sun Yu scratched his head and regarded Yang Kai with curiosity.

Yang Kai grew serious and said, "Kid, how about a deal?"

"You're flattering me, Senior — tell me what you want and if I can do it I'll help," Sun Yu said awkwardly.

Yang Kai shook his head, resolute: "I only want to make a deal with you."

Sun Yu's face turned serious as he realized Yang Kai might propose something big; after a moment's thought he said, "I appreciate your kindness, Senior — speak."

"You want power; I can give you power!" Yang Kai grinned. "But you must promise me one thing... when we leave here and you return to Dragon‑Phoenix Palace, you must not reveal anything about me."

Sun Yu was stunned. "Why?"

"No reason." Yang Kai shook his head. "Just trust me."

"But Senior, since you can activate this sealing formation, you must be tied to our Sect... and the Palace has waited a lifetime..."

"I don't want them to know about me for now. Maybe later, when time allows, I will go see your Palace Master." Yang Kai answered offhand.

He still had the Nine Heavens Sacred Land mess to clean up; if he tangled with Dragon‑Phoenix Palace now, he might never find peace in life.

However, since the Phoenix Empress's inheritance was hidden in the Phoenix Nest, he would surely bring Su Yan back here some day.

The Palace folks presently assumed Sun Yu had opened the seal and raised his strength; that served to conceal the truth, provided Sun Yu kept his mouth shut.

Yang Kai felt some fondness for the lad and couldn't bring himself to kill him to silence him.

With Yang Kai's resources, cultivating someone was trivial — even a mediocre talent like Sun Yu could be transformed, and since Sun Yu's technique shared the same Yang attribute as Yang Kai's, he was particularly valuable.

With a nod from Sun Yu, he could gain opportunities others could hardly imagine.

After deliberation Sun Yu said, "I don't know why you do this, Senior, but you must have your reasons... You wouldn't harm Dragon‑Phoenix Palace, would you?"

"Of course not." Yang Kai smiled.

"Alright, I promise I won't reveal your existence!"

"Smart kid!" Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction.
