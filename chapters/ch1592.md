## Chapter 1592 — Interesting Things

Yang Kai was originally not very interested in this Blood Prison Trial; after all, the place was specifically prepared as a proving ground for warriors of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

He was only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; although he could fight above his rank and feared no warrior below the Void King Realm, his cultivation had not reached the required level. Yang Kai believed he would not gain much from entering the Blood Prison, so he left Qian Tong and the others behind and went to the Tongxuan Continent to look for his relatives and friends.

But after Shan Qingluo told him that Domain Stones existed within the Blood Prison, he became interested.

Now that he was here in person, Yang Kai fully understood that even without Domain Stones, simply relying on the Domain vortices suffusing the Blood Prison he could gain unimaginable benefits.

So long as one's ability was sufficient, practitioners of any level of the Origin Returning Realm could use the Domain vortices to refine their own Shi and push it toward a consummate realm! This had nothing to do with cultivation rank.

That said, very few could actually do so.

Yang Kai happened to be one of them.

At the same time, a hundred li away from the Blood Prison rose a great mountain, ten thousand zhang high, and atop its peak stood a stone pavilion.

At this moment, seven or eight practitioners sat composed within the stone pavilion. They ranged from old to young, male and female, but without exception all of them were experts at the Void King Realm.

Anyone seeing such a terrifying lineup would likely be horrified.

This was absolutely an exceedingly fearsome force.

These experts sat at their places in the pavilion, some with eyes closed cultivating, others conversing in pairs discussing the Martial Dao, and some watching coldly.

They were the top experts gathered from the various Cultivation Stars across the entire Star Domain!

When a Blood Prison Trial opened they hurried here, not to gawk, but to scout talent.

They waited for the day those who entered the Blood Prison walked back out.

To enter the Blood Prison and emerge unscathed meant the practitioner had enormous potential; even if they could not later ascend to the Void King Realm, they would still be among the top experts of the Origin Returning Realm.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild sent experts here, so did the Purple Star, and the Sword Alliance likewise had representatives...

It could be said that the seven or eight Void King Realm experts here represented the pinnacle of the major powers across the Star Domain.

Every time a Blood Prison Trial opened they came to Cuiwei Star to seek out promising talent to take back and cultivate within their own forces.

Of course, some came for the Domain Stones produced by the Blood Prison.

They themselves had attained the Void King Realm and did not need Domain Stones, but they had nephews and juniors who did. Every Domain Stone brought out of the Blood Prison could be bought at a high price.

Among the seven or eight Void King Realm experts, the most eye-catching was a man wearing a golden robe with a purple-gold crown binding his hair. When the others looked at him a subtle solemnity showed in their faces.

The man appeared not to be very old, seemingly around thirty. His sword-like brows slanted sharply toward his temples, and though his expression was calm, it carried an innate majesty—an aura of one born to command respect.

At this moment he sat with his eyes closed, conserving his spirit.

After a while he opened his eyes and let out a soft "eh", clearly surprised.

All the Void King Realm experts around turned their attention to him.

An old matron furrowed her brow thoughtfully, smiling faintly as she looked at him and asked, "Lord Luo Hai, have you discovered something interesting? If it's convenient, could you tell us? You know, on Cuiwei Star only the Star Lord can sense some happenings within the Blood Prison."

Someone nodded in agreement, saying, "Indeed, Brother Luo Hai, though we sit quite close to the Blood Prison, you know what that place is like—our Divine Sense cannot penetrate it at all. What on earth is going on inside now?"

The man called Luo Hai smiled, stood up, and said without haste, "I have indeed found something interesting, though it's nothing major—no need for so much fuss. Hmm, in this Blood Prison Trial a youngster at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm went in."

"Oh? The Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm?" The old matron's expression jolted.

The others showed surprise as well.

"A Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm going deep into the Blood Prison isn't unheard of, but it's extremely rare, and those people's fates are seldom good—basically they fall dead after a day or two inside. They're always some conceited, short-sighted youngsters; this one is probably the same." The old matron slowly shook her head, full of disdain.

"Yes, such youngsters won't behave unless they suffer a loss. Historically, only practitioners of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm have ever entered the Blood Prison. There is no written rule or explicit restriction, but it's an understanding concluded by predecessors over tens of thousands of years!"

"Brother Luo Hai, how is that kid's situation now? You're so interested—has he shown something extraordinary?" A beautiful woman asked with a smile, her brows and eyes like a painting, possessing cultivation at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, yet she had to be cautious when facing Luo Hai.

This was not only because Luo Hai's cultivation was a stage higher than hers, but because this was Cuiwei Star—Luo Hai's territory!

No one would be foolish enough to oppose the Star Lord on a Cultivation Star!

Frankly, even top warriors at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm might not be able to kill Luo Hai on Cuiwei Star.

Here, he was the sovereign.

When the day came that Luo Hai advanced to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, any expert who came to Cuiwei Star would have to act according to his mood, and having refined the Stellar Origin, Luo Hai certainly had that potential!

Thus, while these Void King Realm experts feared Luo Hai, their words were tinged with flattery.

"He hasn't shown anything extraordinary." Luo Hai smiled slightly. "I'm just curious; I haven't seen such an interesting youngster in a long time. Hmm, he seems to have charged into a Domain vortex. I can't investigate the specifics—after all, it's the Blood Prison. Even though I'm the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, my Divine Sense is greatly limited there."

"Charged into a Domain vortex?" The old matron sighed, "It seems he's doomed. There are always people who don't know their place."

"Such people deserve to be taught a lesson!"

"Forget him—don't pay him any mind. He won't live long. Better to wait a while and see if any promising seedling emerges alive."

"Indeed—once in a thousand years. We come to Cuiwei Star for that day."

The crowd jabbered, and Luo Hai smiled at their words: "Gentlemen, I know why you came, but allow me a reminder—if you favor any promising youth, do not use force; everything must be voluntary. As Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, I have the duty and responsibility to protect those youngsters and ensure they receive fair treatment."

"Brother Luo Hai, you're being modest. In all these years, when have we ever forced anyone? Of course it's always up to them." The beautiful woman pursed her lips and smiled.

"I don't want people; I came only to buy Domain Stones. Heh heh—let the youngsters scramble for them themselves." An old man with white hair chuckled, then added somewhat unwillingly, "If Brother Luo Hai didn't forbid it, I'd personally go into the Blood Prison to look for Domain Stones."

"Brother Zhou, that's mistaken," Luo Hai shook his head. "It's not that I forbid it; it's that the Blood Prison carries a restriction the previous Star Lord of Cuiwei Star imposed before his death. No Void King Realm practitioner can enter. Even though I am now the new Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, I cannot lift that restriction. Perhaps after a few thousand years, when my strength reaches the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, I will be able to ignore it."

"The previous Star Lord imposed a restriction?" Everyone was startled; none seemed to have heard of such a thing.

"Indeed. I have not publicized it, but it's true. Otherwise, why do you think that great battle tens of thousands of years ago left no one to emerge from the Blood Prison?"

"Was it because of that restriction?" someone mused.

"Yes. That restriction was imposed using the very Origin power of Cuiwei Star; it not only barred Void King Realm experts from entering but also prevented them from leaving." Luo Hai nodded slightly.

"No wonder—no wonder that more than a dozen or even twenty top practitioners of our caliber didn't come out alive. So that's the reason," the questioner realized.

There were many mysteries surrounding the great battle tens of thousands of years ago; the biggest was that no one survived.

Even though that battle was unprecedented and the number of Void King Realm experts involved was enormous, it was impossible in reason for the entire force to be annihilated; at least a few should have survived.

But in fact, historical records state that none survived.

Now, hearing Luo Hai's explanation, they understood.

Because the restriction was imposed using Cuiwei Star's Origin power and could not be removed without the Star Lord, other Void King Realm experts truly could not leave; the probable result was that the previous Star Lord, outnumbered, went down with the enemy.

Upon learning the truth of the Blood Prison's birth, everyone sighed and fell silent.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Luo Hai suddenly made a soft "eh" again, his face full of astonishment.

"Lord Luo Hai, have you discovered something interesting again?" the old matron asked, frowning.

"Interesting—indeed very interesting." Luo Hai's brow lifted and his face showed extreme surprise as he said in a low voice, "That youngster actually walked out of the Domain vortex!"

"What?" The old matron was greatly alarmed.

"Brother Luo Hai, do you mean that Second Stage youngster from before?" the beautiful woman was shocked too.

"Indeed! This is truly interesting—how did he survive?" Luo Hai looked puzzled. Even as Star Lord of Cuiwei Star he couldn't fully probe the situation inside the Blood Prison, so he was very surprised that Yang Kai had lived.

"Could it be that the Domain vortex was very weak?" someone speculated. "There are countless Domain vortices in the Blood Prison; some are negligible. Perhaps he encountered such a vortex."

"No! Before him a Third Stage practitioner died in that Domain vortex, so this vortex is by no means weak," Luo Hai slowly shook his head, denying the guess.
