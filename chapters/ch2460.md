## Chapter 2460 — Transaction

Yin Lesheng smiled and said, "I am not out of my mind. In fact, I'm quite clear-headed. If we want to leave this place, Brother Yang's strength is absolutely essential."

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and chuckled, "I understand what you mean, Brother Yin, but what makes you think I'll take you out?"

Yin Lesheng replied in a deep voice, "Aren't you trying to find out about that puppet? That puppet is very important to you, isn't it?"

Hearing him mention Xiaoxiao, Yang Kai's expression darkened and he shouted, "Where is it!"

Yin Lesheng laughed calmly and said, "Brother Yang, you really do value it. Since you want something, so do I. Why don't we make a deal?"

Yang Kai gritted his teeth. Although he wanted nothing more than to rush over and beat Yin Lesheng up, then force him to reveal Xiaoxiao's whereabouts, brute force wouldn't solve the problem right now. As long as Yin Lesheng refused to tell him about Xiaoxiao, Yang Kai had no way out. Even if he did talk, Yang Kai couldn't be sure if it was true or not.

Compared to killing Yin Lesheng, Yang Kai was far more concerned about Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts. After a moment’s thought, he nodded and said, “How do you want to make this trade? Let’s hear your terms.”

Yin Lesheng said, "You take me out of this damned place, and I'll tell you exactly where that puppet is."

Yang Kai sneered, "How do I know you're telling the truth? Maybe you don't even know where Xiaoxiao is."

"I know!" Yin Lesheng's expression turned serious. "Let me be frank with you—back then, your puppet did indeed fall into the Eastern Territory with me. But with my strength at the time, I couldn't subdue it, so I simply trailed behind, waiting for the right moment. Unfortunately, I never got my chance. As for where it ended up, I'm the only person in this world who knows—no one else. Brother Yang, you'd best think carefully: do you really want to fight me to the death here, both of us suffering, or would you rather make a fair trade and get what you want?"

Yang Kai's face was cold as he said, "Tell me first, and I'll send you out immediately. I guarantee I won't lay a hand on you!"

Yin Lesheng laughed and said, "Do you take me for a three-year-old child?"

"Then what do you want?" Yang Kai asked impatiently.

The two argued back and forth, neither giving in. The other three watched in amazement. Although they didn't know exactly what Yang Kai and Yin Lesheng were arguing about, they could guess a little.

Suddenly, Chang Hao said, "Brother Yin, can he really take us out of here?"

Yin Lesheng glanced at him and said, "If he can't, then no one can."

"Why?" Chang Hao asked in shock. "This place is a void crevice. If we don't break the space barrier, there's no way to leave. Even when so many of us worked together before, we couldn't do it. How can he do it alone?"

Yin Lesheng frowned and said, "Because this Brother Yang is proficient in Spatial Power."

"Proficient in Spatial Power?" Chang Hao was both surprised and delighted when he heard this, his eyes burning as he looked at Yang Kai, as if he saw hope for survival.

The other two were also extremely excited, secretly licking their lips.

"This Young Master is indeed proficient in the Power of Space. But what does it have to do with you!" Yang Kai glared at the three, full of annoyance.

Chang Hao put on a fawning smile and said, "Hehe, Brother Yang, we may have met through fighting, but now only a few of us are left alive. If you really can leave, why not take us with you? Don't worry, we will surely repay you handsomely in the future!"

"Yes, yes, Brother Yang, we will remember your kindness and repay you someday!"

"Brother Yang, more friends means more paths. If you ever come to my Western Territory, I, Sun, will definitely welcome you with open arms!"

The other two chimed in with Chang Hao, looking at Yang Kai with pleading faces.

"Get lost!" Yang Kai snapped impatiently.

Chang Hao's expression gradually turned cold as he stared at Yang Kai and said, "Yang Kai, don't be so ungrateful. You may be strong, but can you handle the four of us together? Don't force us to get rough!"

Yang Kai snorted coldly, "I wasn't afraid of forty of you before, and now there are only four left. What can you do to me? If you want to die, come and try."

Chang Hao's face stiffened, but he knew Yang Kai was right. Even forty people couldn't do anything to him before. Now, even if the four of them joined forces, they might not be able to take him down. Besides, it's said that those proficient in the power of space are the hardest to deal with. Even if you can't beat them, they're the best at escaping.

Yang Kai ignored Chang Hao and the other two, turning to look at Yin Lesheng and said coldly, "Since you want to make a deal, then give us both a convincing solution. Otherwise, you'll die today. At worst, I'll go to the Eastern Territory and search slowly myself."

Yin Lesheng's face darkened. "Brother Yang, are you so sure you can kill me?"

Yang Kai curled his lips, "Here I could kill you with a flick of my hand. Do you think I can't?"

As he spoke, Yang Kai casually waved his hand, and a stream of void turbulence suddenly surged out as if commanded, rolling out like a long river and blasting toward Yin Lesheng.

Yin Lesheng was startled and quickly dodged to the side.

After regaining his footing, his face was ashen.

He had thought he had a trump card and didn't need to fear Yang Kai, but now it seemed that this special environment not only didn't restrict Yang Kai, it actually increased his strength. If they really fought here, his chances of winning were less than twenty percent!

He had to leave here quickly, or things might change for the worse!

Thinking of this, Yin Lesheng said in a deep voice, "Brother Yang, take a look at this!"

As he spoke, he casually tossed something toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai wasn't afraid of any tricks. He caught it and swept it with his Divine Sense, then said in surprise, "Oh? A Soul Contract?"

Yin Lesheng raised his eyebrows, "It's good that Brother Yang recognizes this."

The Soul Contract was a little thing created by Great Emperor Youhun, the master of the Soul Palace in the Eastern Territory, out of boredom back in the day. Simply put, it's like a written contract. The signers swear on their Divine Souls, and because the Soul Contract contains a special power, neither party can violate its terms. If they do, they'll suffer the pain of Soul-Devouring.

The Soul Contract is extremely rare elsewhere. Yang Kai had seen it before, so he recognized it and knew how authoritative it was. As long as both parties swear on their Divine Souls, once the contract takes effect, it can't be broken unless you're willing to die.

Since the Soul Contract was created by Great Emperor Youhun, and his Soul Palace is in the Eastern Territory, it's normal for Yin Lesheng, a disciple of Netherworld Sect in the same territory, to have one.

"Is this enough to show my sincerity?" Yin Lesheng looked at Yang Kai seriously.

Yang Kai nodded, "With a Soul Contract, there's no problem."

Yin Lesheng said, "Good. You get me out of here, and I'll tell you where the puppet is."

Yang Kai thought for a moment and nodded, "No problem."

Chang Hao said anxiously, "Brother Yin, take me too! My Brahma Heaven Sacred Land and your Netherworld Sect are allied sects. You can't just watch me die!"

Yin Lesheng frowned and glanced at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted, "Chang Hao's fate has already been decided. He must die here!"

Chang Hao's eyes widened in anger. "Who? Who wants my life!"

Yang Kai looked at him coldly and snorted, "Whoever you abandoned, that's who wants your life!"

Chang Hao was stunned and muttered, "Chang Xian?" Then he shouted angrily, "Outrageous! I'm the Senior Brother, and he actually wants someone else to kill me! Unbelievable!"

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, ignoring him, and looked at Yin Lesheng, "Brother Yin, make your vow!"

"Alright!" Yin Lesheng nodded, then swore on his Divine Soul: if Yang Kai would safely take him out of here, he must tell Yang Kai Xiaoxiao's whereabouts.

Next, Yang Kai also swore on his Divine Soul.

As the power of their Divine Souls surged, the Soul Contract suddenly shone brightly, split in two, and turned into two streams of light that entered Yang Kai and Yin Lesheng's bodies. Both of them grunted, feeling as if an invisible shackle had bound them.

They both knew that the Soul Contract was now in effect.

"Where is Xiaoxiao?" Yang Kai squinted at Yin Lesheng.

Yin Lesheng smiled slightly, moved his lips, and sent a message with his voice.

Yang Kai's expression changed dramatically. "How could it be there?"

Yin Lesheng was surprised, "Oh? Brother Yang actually knows that place?"

Yang Kai's face was grim. "I just heard about it not long ago. Are you sure it went there?"

Yin Lesheng said, "I saw it with my own eyes. How could it be false? At first, I didn't know what that place was, but after living in the Eastern Territory for a while, I learned how dangerous it is. Luckily, I didn't follow it in, or I probably wouldn't be seeing you today."

Yang Kai's face was ashen. Compared to not knowing Xiaoxiao's whereabouts, now he was even more worried.

Yin Lesheng had already sworn on his Divine Soul and was bound by the Soul Contract, so he couldn't lie. But if Xiaoxiao really went to that place, it was definitely a deadly situation.

His expression was extremely ugly.

Yin Lesheng, however, was all smiles. "Alright, Brother Yang, I've told you everything you wanted to know. Now it's your turn to fulfill your promise."

Yang Kai gave him an annoyed look, then suddenly reached out and tore open a crack in the nearby void.

Yin Lesheng stared without blinking. When he saw Yang Kai really tear open a spatial rift, he was both shocked and delighted. He said in a deep voice, "Brother Yang is truly remarkable. If you ever become an Emperor, you'll surely be the next Li Wuyi!"

"Get lost!" Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Yin Lesheng laughed loudly, "Then I'll take my leave. I hope we meet again!"

"The day we meet again will be the day you die!" Yang Kai said through gritted teeth.

Yin Lesheng didn't care. His figure flickered as he rushed into the spatial rift and instantly appeared on the other side.

Seeing this, Chang Hao and the others couldn't wait to follow, each using their own abilities to try to escape from here.

Yang Kai watched them coldly and didn't try to stop them.
