## Chapter 2039 — Farewell Mu Xiao

Han Leng's Origin Qi could not stop the spike in the slightest; it was pierced straight through, and then a small hole appeared on his forehead — the spike had gone clean through his entire skull, a clear sign of its terrifying power.

Han Leng was powerful in his own right, and even after such a mortal wound he did not die immediately; instead he turned his head with a shocked expression. When he saw who had ambushed him he cried in horror, "How could it be you? This is impossible!"

He had assumed his attacker was Liu Yizhi—whose strength matched his own—since Liu Yizhi had disappeared after that final blow. He thought Liu Yizhi had either been smashed to pieces or had taken the opportunity to conceal himself.

After the ambush, Han Leng assumed Liu Yizhi had vanished because he’d seized the chance to conceal himself.

But when he clearly saw who had actually attacked him, he realized he had been wrong.

The attacker standing behind him with a strange smile was not Liu Yizhi at all, but Ning Yuancheng — the man he had personally killed!

The scene was impossible: Ning Yuancheng had only reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; Han Leng had killed him with his long sword, and upon searching the corpse had already confirmed his death.

How could the dead come back to life?

But when Han Leng caught sight of Ning Yuancheng's odd, distinctive features, a sudden understanding seemed to dawn on him and he murmured, "So that's how it is..." 

As those words left his lips, his head tilted and he went limp.

Nearby, Yang Kai felt his scalp prickle and cold sweat break out; staring ahead, he could not help but shout, "Mu Xiao!"

From where he stood, he had seen the previous scene almost perfectly.

While he and Han Leng had been talking, the man who should have been dead — Ning Yuancheng — had risen up silently and strangely, then opened his mouth and shot out a blue wooden spike that easily pierced Han Leng's skull.

That Han Leng would fall for it so easily was partly because his strength had been greatly reduced from the prior battle, and partly because of Yang Kai's shout.

Han Leng had thought Yang Kai was deceiving him, so he never imagined a lethal danger was approaching from behind; by the time he realized it, it was already too late.

How could a martial artist spit out such a blue wooden spike? The thing resembled those Yang Kai had seen earlier in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda and in Fenglin City, so he recognized it at once.

It was clearly one of the ancient Mu Xiao that had wreaked havoc in Fenglin City before.

On that day the Mu Xiao had brought disaster to Fenglin City; Emperor Realm experts had intervened personally, and thousands of cultivators had died. After the turmoil, the city lord's mansion issued a statement that the Mu Xiao threat had been eliminated to reassure the populace.

Now it was clear that the city lord's mansion had been trying to soothe the people — the Mu Xiao had not been completely exterminated, and strange wooden seeds had been lodged within certain cultivators.

This time the embedded presence was exceptionally concealed; not even the six Emperor Realm experts detected it, nor did Ning Yuancheng or his guardian Liu Yizhi.

If Ning Yuancheng had not suddenly died this time, the wooden seed would never have been exposed; with the host dead, the seed no longer needed to hide.

All of it was a series of coincidences!

In a flash Yang Kai worked out the truth, and his expression darkened.

He had taken part in hunting Mu Xiao avatars in Fenglin City and knew how troublesome and hard to eradicate they were; even when dozens worked together they still suffered losses. Now he stood alone.

As his thoughts shifted, an odd gurgling sound came from Ning Yuancheng, and along with it Han Leng's body rapidly withered away.

This was one of the Mu Xiao's strange abilities: it could quickly devour a living being's flesh and blood essence to strengthen itself.

Ning Yuancheng had initially only given off the aura of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, but as he continuously consumed Han Leng's flesh and blood essence that aura climbed step by step; soon it reached the peak of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and then soared to the level of the Dao Origin Realm.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; knowing that if he did not act it would soon be too late, he roared, "Don't you dare!"

As he spoke, a burning long sword appeared in his hand — an energy manifestation condensed from the fire aspect of the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi.

He shifted his form, propelled by spatial power, flashed before Ning Yuancheng, and swung the sword down!

There was an explosive boom as the air turned blisteringly hot.

The Mu Xiao were wood-element beings, and fire-type force was their bane — Mo Xiaoqi had told Yang Kai this, and during the days in Fenglin City Yang Kai had tested it repeatedly.

Against a Mu Xiao avatar, fire was even more effective than space force.

That sword aimed straight for Ning Yuancheng's skull; if it landed it would cleave him in two.

But the Mu Xiao avatar would not let Yang Kai succeed so easily. Ning Yuancheng's mouth gaped wide, the blue spike still piercing Han Leng's skull, ravenously drawing in his flesh-and-blood essence; a glint flashed in his eyes, his arms swept out, and with a series of crackling pops and grotesque contortions his limbs suddenly split into two thick vines, surging forth like a dragon breaching the sea—one lashing across toward Yang Kai's waist while the other planted itself before Ning Yuancheng as a shield.

Hissss...

The fire sword cut, and one of the vines took a sizable wound but was not completely severed; Ning Yuancheng howled in pain and made a strange sound from his mouth.

At the same time, the other vine had already come at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; he vanished in a flash.

The vine swung through empty air!

The vine Yang Kai had cut was burning, but after a flash of blue light the flame was extinguished and the nearly-broken vine recovered as if nothing had happened.

"How is that possible?" Yang Kai reappeared, astonished.

Several Mu Xiao avatars had died at his hand in Fenglin City; though their vitality was tenacious and difficult to destroy, none had been as resilient and powerful as this one.

He had shown no restraint in that strike moments ago; by rights he should have severed the foe's vine and dealt a heavy blow.

Yet this Mu Xiao avatar remained completely unscathed.

This abnormality put Yang Kai on guard; he vaguely sensed this Mu Xiao avatar was no ordinary one.

While Yang Kai's attack had failed, Han Leng had already been sucked dry into a husk, and Ning Yuancheng withdrew the wooden spike from his mouth, a warped smile of satisfaction on his twisted face.

"First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!" Yang Kai felt the aura Ning Yuancheng exuded and his face went cold.

Ning Yuancheng looked at Yang Kai with venom as if blaming him for ruining his feast. His body trembled and his clothes were torn into countless pieces that scattered about; from his abdomen, chest and thighs countless blue vines erupted, each tipped like the sharpest blade.

In an instant Ning Yuancheng's appearance changed completely.

He no longer resembled a man — he was plainly a Mu Xiao, only traces of Ning Yuancheng's facial features remained on a trunk-like body; the myriad vines writhed like poisonous serpents and made one's flesh creep.

The flying vines thrust toward Yang Kai like heavenly whips falling from the nine skies, terrifying to behold, while others swept outward and wrapped around the corpses of Fei Sheng Palace disciples, driving their barbed tips into those bodies to devour their flesh and blood essence.

The sound of gulping and swallowing came as many corpses visibly shriveled.

"You wish!" Yang Kai's face hardened; he condensed fire sword intent and flung it out with a swing.

Hissss... one after another slicing sounds rang out as the searing fire sword intent precisely pierced through the Fei Sheng Palace disciples' corpses; the boundless heat instantly burned those corpses clean.

A Dao Origin Realm Mu Xiao avatar was already difficult enough; Yang Kai would not give it any more time to grow stronger.

Seeing this, the Mu Xiao avatar turned abruptly to face Yang Kai and from the trunk's region where Ning Yuancheng's features remained came a shrill, piercing cry as if in great rage. Its body quivered and innumerable root-like tendrils shot downwards like earthworms to burrow and take root.

Then, with a shake, countless vines shot forward like arrows in a frenzied assault toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned, used spatial force to evade the strike, and then released the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal.

"Get it!" Yang Kai roared. In a flash he lunged before the Mu Xiao, the burning long sword in his hand condensing into a rolling heat wave, and he brought it down with the crushing force of a mountain toppling from the sky.

At the same time the Yao Worm Matriarch's purple-green twin swords carved a two-toned radiance as a biting chill spread; snowflakes began to fall from the sky.

Snow Like Clear Sky!

The snowflakes twirled down lazily, but each was like a blade; when they struck the Mu Xiao's vines small wounds appeared, green fluid oozed out, and the chilling profound intent seeped into the vines' interior, greatly hindering their regenerative ability.

The Yao Worm Matriarch seized the moment to close in, twin swords striking as she cooperated with Yang Kai to slash all around.

The Azure Flame Thunder Jackal stayed farther off, opening and closing its jaws to spit out balls of azure flame that slammed into the Mu Xiao with explosive bangs.

For a time, Yang Kai and the two blood beasts fought in unison and pinned the Mu Xiao avatar down, leaving it with no room to counterattack.
