## Chapter 2611 — Instant Kill

Yang Kai beamed and said, "Tsk tsk, that offer is truly tempting. But this Young Master has quite a grudge with the Netherworld Sect, especially with your Sect Master's personal disciple, Yin Lesheng..."

Wu Yuanzheng replied, "This Lord has already said, as long as you are willing to join our Sect, all past grievances will be written off. As for Junior Nephew Yin, this Lord will persuade him. I trust he knows what is truly important."

"You mean everything will really be wiped clean?" Yang Kai raised his brow.

"Once this Lord gives his word, how could I deceive you?"

"Even if Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen have already been killed by me?"

Wu Yuanzheng's eyes narrowed, his smile vanishing in an instant as he shouted in a deep voice, "What did you say?"

Yang Kai said blandly, "Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen have already been killed by me."

Wu Yuanzheng roared, "Impossible!"

The only reason he had come here was because he heard that Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen had brought a group of Netherworld Sect disciples to the Ancient Land to trouble an enemy. Yin Lesheng was the Sect Master's personal disciple, and had broken through from the Star Realm below, with outstanding talent and a bright future. He was of great value to the Netherworld Sect, and the Sect Master valued him highly.

As for Hua Feichen, he was an Elder of the Netherworld Sect, holding a position of great power within the Sect.

The two had brought many disciples into the Ancient Land, but Wu Yuanzheng and the Sect Master had not known about it beforehand; they had acted in secret.

Later, the Sect Master happened to hear about it and, in his anger, also became worried. The Ancient Land was extremely dangerous, and he feared something might happen to his personal disciple, so he sent Wu Yuanzheng to search personally.

After arriving, Wu Yuanzheng first sought out the Qi Family Stronghold. From there, he learned of the grudge between Yin Lesheng and Yang Kai, and from Qi Hai, he learned that Yang Kai possessed the True Phoenix Fire.

Wu Yuanzheng was overjoyed, realizing that this trip might be a great opportunity for himself.

If he could obtain the True Phoenix Fire and refine it, then perhaps he could become another Martial Flame Great Emperor in the future! At that time, even the Netherworld Sect would have to obey his commands.

He secretly made up his mind: he wanted to find Yin Lesheng, and also seize Yang Kai's True Phoenix Fire. That was why he was willing to grant Yang Kai an Elder's position.

How could a mere First Stage Emperor be worthy of possessing such a divine object as the True Phoenix Fire? Only an expert like himself at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm was qualified to subdue such a divine flame and make it his own.

Who could have expected Yang Kai to suddenly drop such a bombshell...

After returning from the Shattered Star Sea, Yin Lesheng had broken through to the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, while Hua Feichen was at the Second Stage. Now Yang Kai claimed to have killed them both.

Wu Yuanzheng's first thought was disbelief, not to mention that Yin Lesheng still had the Emperor Extinction Pill bestowed by the Sect Master, which sealed a full-power strike from a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert.

"Just you? Kid, aren't you afraid the wind will cut your tongue with all that boasting?" sneered the Netherworld Sect Elder who had attacked Qi Hai earlier, clearly not believing Yang Kai's claim. With Yang Kai's cultivation laid bare for all to see, how could he possibly have the strength to kill Hua Feichen, a Second Stage Emperor Realm master?

But as soon as he finished speaking, his eyes suddenly widened in shock as he looked ahead.

Over there, something suddenly appeared in Yang Kai's hand, pitch-black and shrouded in sinister energy. As it fluttered in the wind, it let out a chorus of ghostly wails.

"The Netherworld Infernal Banner!" the Elder cried out in shock, and even Wu Yuanzheng couldn't help but twitch, his gaze fixed on the banner.

"It really is the Netherworld Infernal Banner..."

"And the aura within this banner is so dense, it doesn't seem like a Dao Origin-Grade, but rather an Imperial-Grade Netherworld Infernal Banner!"

"Within the Sect, only the Elders, Sect Master, and Vice Sect Master possess Imperial-Grade Netherworld Infernal Banners... Could he really have killed Elder Hua?"

The Netherworld Sect disciples, shocked, began to chatter all at once.

The Netherworld Infernal Banner was a Secret Treasure that every Netherworld Sect disciple would refine, but its power varied according to the cultivator's strength.

The one Yang Kai held was precisely the Imperial Treasure left behind after Hua Feichen's death. Some disciples couldn't distinguish the aura on the banner, but Wu Yuanzheng and the other Elder recognized it at once—it was Hua Feichen's.

In that moment, Wu Yuanzheng's face turned ashen.

If Hua Feichen was dead, then Yin Lesheng, who had been with him, likely hadn't fared any better. The Sect Master had poured so much effort into Yin Lesheng, treating him as the future successor of the Netherworld Sect. If he died, who could calm the Sect Master's fury?

"You really did kill Elder Hua!" The Netherworld Sect Elder roared in fury, "Boy, hand over your life!"

In his rage, he flew at Yang Kai without hesitation, black energy billowing from his body, his aura sinister and terrifying. It seemed he wanted to kill Yang Kai to avenge Hua Feichen, though who knew what their relationship truly was.

Wu Yuanzheng was startled and quickly shouted, "Elder Zhong, come back!"

Although Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, if he could kill Hua Feichen, Elder Zhong was definitely not his match. Elder Zhong had lost his reason in his anger, but Wu Yuanzheng saw the situation clearly.

But his shout was a moment too late.

Yang Kai looked at the charging Elder Zhong, unperturbed, and chuckled, "No need to rush, Elder Zhong. This Young Master will send you to join Hua Feichen."

He slowly raised his hand, about to strike, when a graceful figure suddenly flashed behind him.

Ji Yao, radiating an aura of extreme cold, stepped in front of him. Her jade hand closed slightly in the void, and a long sword appeared out of nowhere.

An astonishing aura swept out as Ji Yao seemed to transform into an eternal iceberg, freezing any who dared approach.

"Second Stage of the Emperor Realm!" Elder Zhong exclaimed in terror, utterly shocked.

He had seen Ji Yao before, but since she had always stood behind Yang Kai, he assumed she was just his attendant or maid.

After all, what kind of power could a First Stage Emperor's attendant or maid have?

Not just him—even Wu Yuanzheng had never given Ji Yao a second glance from the start.

Only now, as Ji Yao made her move, did they realize how gravely mistaken they had been.

This quiet woman who had stood behind Yang Kai actually possessed strength at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, far surpassing Yang Kai himself.

Ji Yao drew her sword, its light flashing and ringing with a clear sound. The profound intent of freezing all things spread out, enveloping Elder Zhong.

In midair, Elder Zhong felt his whole body stiffen as the laws of ice enveloped him. His Emperor Yuan would not circulate, and his hair and beard instantly froze into frost.

He was no match! Elder Zhong's eyes bulged as he screamed, "Vice Sect Master, save me!"

But how could Wu Yuanzheng save him? Elder Zhong had attacked without warning and with great speed, and was already close to Yang Kai. Even if Wu Yuanzheng wanted to help, it was too late.

Before everyone's eyes, the light of Ji Yao's sword flashed and then she returned to her motionless, mountain-like stance, as if she had never moved at all.

Yet on Elder Zhong's chest, a strange Ice Flower had appeared.

The Ice Flower had six petals, crystal clear and beautiful, but within that beauty lurked deadly danger. With a crisp cracking sound, the Ice Flower suddenly spread, covering Elder Zhong's entire body and sealing him completely.

Through the clear ice, hundreds of eyes could still see Elder Zhong's frozen, terrified expression.

The frozen Elder Zhong fell from the sky, and the moment he hit the ground, he shattered into pieces, his body splitting apart without a drop of blood.

Instant kill!

An Elder of the Netherworld Sect at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm had actually been killed in a single blow by this otherworldly-looking woman! The sheer shock of the scene left everyone stunned, unable to recover for a long time.

"Those who dare to shout before my Master, die!" Ji Yao said coolly, her beautiful eyes sweeping the crowd.

Anyone her gaze touched couldn't help but shiver.

Only Wu Yuanzheng, his fury erupting like a volcano, nearly burst into flames. His robes fluttered without wind, his hair wildly disheveled, and he said in a cold voice, "Good, good, good! It seems our Sect has been quiet for too long—any random cur thinks they can kill our Elders." As he spoke, he glared at Yang Kai and roared, "Yang Kai, even if you hand over the True Phoenix Fire today, you will still die!"

An Elder-level expert had died before his eyes. If he didn't kill the culprit, he would have no way to answer to the Sect.

Yang Kai sneered, "If you want to kill this Young Master, let's see if you have the ability!"

"Then today, this Lord will broaden your horizons!" Wu Yuanzheng grinned savagely, "Don't worry, I won't kill you quickly. I'll drain every drop of your blood! As for the two women beside you... they'll learn what it means to wish for death."

"Vice Sect Master, please kill them and avenge Elder Zhong!"

"Kill them!"

"Those two women are quite the beauties. Before killing them, we might as well enjoy them a bit. Vice Sect Master, you're in for a treat."

"That's right, that's right, heh heh. Those two must be blind to follow that brat. Now they're doomed."

The Netherworld Sect disciples, having recovered from the shock of Elder Zhong's death, suddenly regained their confidence—after all, they had Wu Yuanzheng!

He was the Vice Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect, a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, second only to the Sect Master. With the Vice Sect Master taking action, this man and two women were doomed.

Luan Feng's eyes flashed with a cold light as she heard the Netherworld Sect disciples' vile words. She lowered her voice and asked, 'Sir Yang, would you allow me to handle this one?'"

Yang Kai chuckled, "I was just about to ask for Lady Feng's help!"

A Third Stage Emperor was far stronger than him. Even if he used all his means, killing the opponent would come at a price. The only reason Yang Kai was so fearless was because Luan Feng was by his side.

Otherwise, he would have already taken Ji Yao and fled.

But now, it seemed Wu Yuanzheng was the one in real trouble. He had shamelessly threatened to show Luan Feng what it meant to wish for death, but even if the heavens themselves descended, no one could save him now.
