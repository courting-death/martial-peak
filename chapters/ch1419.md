## Chapter 1419 — Crystal Cannon Volley

Not far off, Mo Xiaosheng and the others entangled with the woman surnamed Ye sighed softly, knowing that at this moment there was nothing more they could do; they had underestimated Dragon Lair Mountain's depth, assuming its ability to cut down the first wave of invaders from the Xie Family relied only on the power of its seals and formations, never imagining that even without those protections this little mountaintop was not to be trifled with.

The four top experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm exchanged glances and all saw the retreat in each other's eyes.

No deliberation was necessary; at their level of strength a single look conveyed much. The four feinted, freed themselves from the woman surnamed Ye's entanglement, and together leapt outward.

With those four withdrawing, who else dared linger? Naturally, everyone hurriedly fled.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu did not stop their adversaries. Although they had lent Dragon Lair Mountain a hand this time, they would not deliberately make enemies of those people; after all, they represented Yingyue Hall and had many concerns. So, after a brief thought, they let their opponents leave safely.

The same went for Wei Guchang and Xuan'er; the two had only recently advanced to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and their foes were formidable—determined to leave, they could not be stopped.

The reason they'd held on until now was because their opponents showed mercy; they had not truly intended to kill. Otherwise, given those enemies' numbers and methods, by this point even if the two were not dead, they would not be unharmed.

The invading forces retreated like a tide; scores of Origin Returning Realm cultivators hurriedly withdrew. Aside from a few that Yang Kai, wielding the Dragon Bone sword, held back, only the Stone Puppet and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird remained entangled with several foes, refusing to let them go.

Yang Kai frowned; a sense of helplessness rose deep within him.

The enemy wanted to leave. He couldn't stop everyone. Though this invasion of Dragon Lair Mountain angered him greatly, the attackers had paid a grievous price; this outcome was not unacceptable.

Moreover, if the fighting continued, Dragon Lair Mountain would inevitably suffer casualties.

He and the woman surnamed Ye were fine—he had the Dragon Bone sword, the Stone Puppet, and the Artifact Spirit. There was also the Divine Tree; the woman surnamed Ye herself was a person of boundless skill. The only ones he worried about were Chang Qi and Hao An—when cornered, rabbits bite. If Chang Qi, Hao An, and the others fell here, that was not what Yang Kai wanted to see.

Yang Kai's willingness to let the storm die down did not mean others shared that view.

Just as those people were about to leave Dragon Lair Mountain's range, the Protective Mountain Array—already broken—flashed and surprisingly reactivated, once again blocking their path.

A flicker of astonishment crossed Mo Xiaosheng and the others' eyes, then their expressions turned cold and severe.

Their withdrawal was merely to avoid the sharp edge for the moment—it did not mean they truly feared Dragon Lair Mountain. Yet the other side’s attitude, showing no intention of letting matters rest, naturally made them feel humiliated and deeply enraged.

“Want to leave? Wishful thinking! Do you take my Dragon Lair Mountain for a place you can come and go as you please?” A clear, feminine shout suddenly rang out. The source of the voice was elusive—at one moment it seemed distant as the horizon, and at the next, close enough to be right before their eyes—utterly impossible to pinpoint.

But the voice was undeniably Yang Yan's.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, struck with astonishment—what was Yang Yan plotting now?

As Yang Kai was stunned, the earth trembled, accompanied by a tremendous buzzing. Cracks split Dragon Lair Mountain's ground again and again; in an instant, the whole hill became shattered.

Boom……

A tremendous roar sounded as a patch of ground seemed to collapse, revealing a vast pit. From it, a hulking, jet-black colossus slowly rose.

Once they made out what the monstrous thing was, cries of astonishment rose in an instant; everyone was dumbstruck.

"Impossible!"

"A warship?"

"There's actually a warship here?"

Dragon Lair Mountain was destined to become the focus of Dark Star's attention today; one shock after another struck the onlookers. They had not yet recovered from the residual awe of the Ancient Divine Spirit's remnant appearing, and now they witnessed an even more incredible sight.

Hidden beneath Dragon Lair Mountain had been a warship all along!

This warship was different from the prized vessels of the great Sects chiefly in size; it was not very large—only a dozen zhang or so in length, barely a quarter the size of an ordinary warship—elliptical in shape with sleek lines.

Yet the ship exuded a chilling oppression; facing it felt even more uneasy than facing the remnant of that true dragon.

A cracking sound issued forth as barrel-like structures extended from the ship's belly. None of those present were uninformed—they knew exactly what these were.

Crystal Cannons! These were offensive Secret Treasures that every warship possessed—one could also call them weapons. They drew Saint Crystals as their source of power, and their might was tremendous.

But warships rarely used Crystal Cannons in ordinary times, for each shot consumed a massive amount of Saint Crystal.

Generally a warship might carry two or three Crystal Cannons at most; the Crystal Cannon was renowned as a ship's trump card.

Yet now, from the belly of this mere dozen-zhang vessel, more than ten Crystal Cannons suddenly extended! They aimed in different directions, all toward the most densely packed clusters of people.

Gazing at those jet-black barrels, a profound unease rose in everyone's hearts, as if the breath of death blew right at them.

A tinkling, coquettish laugh filled the air like a soul-stealing melody, and Yang Yan's coquettish shout came: "Since you've come, don't think to leave!"

As those words fell, dazzling light shimmered within the more-than-ten Crystal Cannon barrels, and tremors of world-shaking energy radiated outward.

"Not good!" Mo Xiaosheng and the others' pupils contracted as they cried, "Spread out!"

With his sight and experience he could sense just how apocalyptic the power contained in those Crystal Cannons was.

He shouted in time, but the attack Yang Yan's ship unleashed was astonishingly swift; almost as Mo Xiaosheng's voice rang out, a dozen or so pearly-white beams, each the thickness of a human arm, shot forth from the Crystal Cannon muzzles.

Silent, without screams, without struggle or resistance, everything in the path of those slender-looking beams was turned to nothingness.

Not only was Dragon Lair Mountain's Protective Mountain Array breached again, but the warriors blocking the exit vanished like snow under a blazing sun.

Those dozen white beams streaked tens of li before their power waned and they dissipated.

The whole Dragon Lair Mountain was a ruin; the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth lay in utter chaos.

Drip, drip……

The crisp sound of dripping reached them. Mo Xiaosheng and the others stood ashen, staring at the suddenly materialized warship in horror, scarcely daring to believe their eyes.

When the ship first appeared they had paid it little heed; its size misled them into thinking it low grade. But when those ten-plus Crystal Cannons extended, Mo Xiaosheng realized he had been mistaken.

Only now did he understand how gravely wrong he'd been.

This ship's grade far exceeded what he could imagine; it was certainly not Origin-Grade—it approached Void King-Grade, otherwise those Crystal Cannons' might could not be so overwhelming.

A Void King-Grade warship! How could that be possible?

But the fact lay before them, leaving no room for doubt. One of the crystal beams had been aimed at them; the four top Origin Returning Realm masters had not dared to take it head-on and could only flee in disarray.

Even so, Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect had been grazed along one side; his entire arm had vanished. The drip-drip sound came from blood falling from his wound, his face contorted in agony.

Old Woman Feng and Cheng Pengxuan's faces were also extremely grim. If not for their speed they would have suffered the same fate as Jin Shi.

Looking around, Mo Xiaosheng wore a face of mourning.

For at this place, the number of survivors was down to merely a dozen or so; at least fifty to sixty Origin Returning Realm cultivators had died under that Crystal Cannon volley.

Those were fifty or sixty Origin Returning Realm experts, not fifty or sixty cabbages—pillars of the major Sects—now inexplicably dead on Dragon Lair Mountain!

Mo Xiaosheng and the others felt their hearts torn like knives.

If it were possible, the great powers' experts would rather never have set foot on this little mountaintop; but regret came too late. The dead could not be revived, and not only had the strong suffered heavy losses, they'd earned such a powerful enemy. For a time, the few survivors' faces were ashen.

"Go!" Mo Xiaosheng gritted his teeth and would not stay. With a flick he used spatial power and fled.

Cheng Pengxuan, Jin Shi, and Old Woman Feng dared not linger either; fearing another Crystal Cannon volley, they fled like rabbits.

This time Yang Yan did not pursue, for she lacked the strength; though the warship was formidable, it was not omnipotent—this volley, grand as it seemed, had consumed enormous reserves.

A scream sounded as Yang Kai killed his last opponent. With a wave his azure great dragon returned to become a verdant longsword and flew back into his hand.

He studied it for a moment with a satisfied expression, then tossed it back into the refining furnace, absorbing it into himself.

Dragon Lair Mountain was now silent, the little dozen-zhang ship hovering in midair.

What had once been a place rich in Spiritual Qi was now a field of devastation after the inconceivable battle.

The Stone Puppet reverted to its original form; the Heaven-Shaking Pillar was nowhere to be seen—likely swallowed in its belly. Now using hands and feet like a monkey, it ran to Yang Kai, climbed up his clothing and onto his shoulder, flashing a simple grin.

Yang Kai turned his head and sighed slowly as he surveyed the scene.

Since arriving on Dark Star he had taken up residence on this Dragon Lair Mountain for several years. Yang Yan and Wu Yi had tended it into something splendid, but now it was unquestionably unfit to live in any longer.

Fortunately Yang Kai had another place to go, so he felt no regret; that place was far better than Dragon Lair Mountain, and he had intended to move everyone there. This incident served as a convenient opportunity.
