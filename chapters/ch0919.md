## Chapter 919 — Small Xuan Realm

Yang Kai and Li Rong followed the same path back. He wore an expression of deep thought; Li Rong fell silent, not daring to disturb him, simply trailing along in his footsteps.

Before long, they were once again outside the Nine Peaks.

Li Rong suddenly whispered, "Master, those below who came to seek pills seem to be in some kind of trouble."

"Hm?" Yang Kai snapped out of his reverie and peered downward. Sure enough, there was a commotion below: many martial artists who had come for pills were clustered in small groups, whispering to one another. Some had already stopped waiting in place and were flying off away from the Nine Peaks.

They looked as if they had discovered something extraordinary and were in a terrible hurry.

Because the Sacred Land had decreed it would not refine pills for anyone for ten days, the martial artists waiting outside the Nine Peaks had been bored, but that alone wouldn’t make them abandon their quest entirely.

Besides, the number of people leaving was rather large.

Yang Kai knit his brows; sensing something amiss, he turned and flew down toward the stone pavilion to investigate.

Inside the pavilion, elders Meng Tianfei and Luo Sheng had been stationed to maintain order. They looked equally puzzled as they watched the restless crowd, at a loss as to what had happened.

In a flash, Yang Kai and Li Rong appeared before them.

The two elders hurriedly rose and saluted.

"What’s going on here?" Yang Kai motioned for them to keep quiet and asked softly.

"I don’t know either. About the time of one incense stick ago, a martial artist seeking pills joined the queue and spoke with a few nearby seekers. After that, many left," Luo Sheng replied.

"Where is that man?" Yang Kai asked.

"At the end of the line." Luo Sheng pointed, and Yang Kai looked over. At the tail of the queue stood a middle-aged man of the Transcendent Realm, sharp-faced and calculating. His eyes glittered, and as more people left the line he slowly advanced forward, a satisfied smile tugging at his lips.

"Shall I go and find out?" Luo Sheng asked.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

Luo Sheng immediately set off.

After a short while he returned with a strange expression and reported, "Saint Lord, that man said he discovered an entrance to a Small Xuan Realm on the way here; those who left went to explore it."

"An entrance to a Small Xuan Realm?" Yang Kai snapped.

"Yes. He spoke with certainty; it doesn’t seem like a lie."

"If he found the entrance, why didn’t he enter it himself and instead spread the news here so others would go? If there’s anything good inside, wouldn’t someone else get it first?" Meng Tianfei said suspiciously. "Doesn’t that imply ulterior motives?"

"He claims his strength is low and he’s alone, so he dared not venture in rashly," Luo Sheng shrugged.

Yang Kai pondered, his face grave. He stared toward the man for a long moment before saying, "Did you find out exactly where this Small Xuan Realm entrance is?"

"About two thousand li from here, to the east!" Luo Sheng replied, pointing.

"Li Rong, let’s go take a look." Yang Kai rose at once.

"Saint Lord, shall I notify the Great Elder and have him accompany you?" Luo Sheng asked.

"No need. We’re just going to take a look, and if I’m not mistaken there likely isn’t anything worthwhile inside," Yang Kai said confidently, and he and Li Rong left again.

When they were out of sight, they summoned the Flying Shuttle, which turned into a streak of azure light and vanished.

On the Flying Shuttle, Li Rong asked, "Do you believe what that man said? Entrances to Small Xuan Realms are notoriously hidden—his claim seems problematic."

In this world there exist many hidden spaces, some vast and some small, called Small Xuan Realms. Some are barren, others house creatures, and a few contain ancient ruins with staggering treasures—find one and you could be wealthy beyond measure for life.

Thus on Tongxuan Continent there are martial artists who make a living searching for and exploring Small Xuan Realms to obtain treasures.

As time passed, fewer undiscovered Small Xuan Realms remained; the easy-to-find entrances had long been entered by seekers, leaving only the most concealed ones.

Naturally, a martial artist claiming to have found an entrance would arouse suspicion.

But people are driven by profit; some would be deceived by his words and rush to the location he described.

If there truly is a Small Xuan Realm there, they could enter and search it; even if not, they wouldn’t stand to lose much.

"I know, but this is different—his strength is low. If he dares spread such a rumor, he’ll be killed when they return. He looks clever; why would he dig his own grave?"

Hearing Yang Kai, Li Rong suddenly thought it made sense and nodded. "So he really found it? He’s incredibly lucky."

Yang Kai shook his head. "Maybe it’s not his doing. Perhaps the entrance to that Small Xuan Realm opened on its own and he merely happened to pass by and notice it."

"Opened on its own?" Li Rong covered her mouth in surprise, her eyes lighting up. "Like the Sacred Tomb’s entrance or the Starry Sky Gate?"

"It’s only a guess. We should go see for ourselves," Yang Kai said.

"I wonder if there’s anything good inside," Li Rong said, unable to hide her excitement.

"There probably isn’t anything." Yang Kai smiled. "That man has surely already checked, or someone else beat him to it. He only spread the news because he confirmed there was nothing valuable—by sending those in front of him away, he shortens his wait for pills."

"Master, you observe everything so carefully," Li Rong said admiringly.

"Mainly because his eyes sparkled when he looked at others; whenever someone left, he showed a look of secret joy," Yang Kai said with a faint smile. "His thoughts were written all over his face; anyone who missed it must have been blinded by greed."

After a while, the Flying Shuttle had traveled two thousand li from the Nine Peaks.

The azure light halted in midair and Yang Kai and Li Rong extended their Divine Sense to scan the surroundings.

Moments later Yang Kai’s expression changed and he steered the Flying Shuttle in a particular direction.

After a dozen breaths, the two appeared not far from the entrance to a pitch-black Void Passage.

Just as Yang Kai had suspected, others had arrived first. Numerous martial artists clustered outside the entrance, warily watching and gathering their strength, displaying a keep-out demeanor.

Yang Kai observed briefly and found their strengths unimpressive—at the Divine Roaming Realm level, not even a Transcendent among them. He ceased concealing himself and strode toward them with Li Rong.

"Who goes there—halt!" The guardians by the entrance bristled at the sight of two figures. One shouted, "This is the prohibited land of the Chen clan. Outsiders may not trespass. If you do not stop, we will be rude."

"Master, should we—" Li Rong asked.

"Be gentle." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

A burst of invisible Divine Sense erupted from Li Rong’s Sea of Consciousness. The martial artists surrounding the entrance instantly went blank-eyed and froze, as if they had not seen Yang Kai and Li Rong at all, allowing the two to pass by and enter the entrance unimpeded.

With Li Rong’s methods, dealing with Divine Roaming Realm fighters was child’s play; clouding their senses was far too simple. Yang Kai had not ordered bloodshed, so Li Rong restrained herself.

Only after the pair had vanished into the passage did the others come to their senses. Looking around and finding the man and woman gone, they realized the pair’s terrifying strength and broke into cold sweat.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai and Li Rong materialized at leisure.

They spread their Divine Sense and discovered traces of many martial artists moving about in all directions, as if everyone was searching for something.

Yang Kai summoned the Flying Shuttle again and, with Li Rong, turned into a streak of azure light and disappeared.

Half an hour later they returned to the entrance.

This Small Xuan Realm did indeed contain a stretch of ruins, though there were no signs of living beings—those martial artists must have entered later to search the ruins for treasure.

Moreover, the Small Xuan Realm was not large—only about a third the size of the Mogu Castle area.

The Chen family should reap a generous harvest this time. Though the clan lacks top experts—only a few Transcendents at most, roughly comparable to the old Zhongdu Eight Great Families—the secret treasures and martial manuals recovered from these ruins will become capital for the family’s rise.

"Let’s go. There’s nothing more to see here." Yang Kai inhaled lightly, and he and Li Rong returned through the entrance.

The martial artists outside stared wide-eyed when the two reappeared, but no longer dared to be as aggressive as before; they were visibly shaken.

They had seen enough to know the two’s methods were astounding.

What reassured them was that the pair bore no intent to harm; after emerging from the Small Xuan Realm they simply walked off into the distance.

"By the way, several Saint-Realm experts are heading this way and will arrive within half a day. You’d better inform your clan elders and withdraw from the Small Xuan Realm, or you may face bloodshed," Yang Kai called back as a friendly warning, then he and Li Rong drifted away.
