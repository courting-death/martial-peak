## Chapter 2271 — What Use Is Face?

Now that the Eighteen Star Array had reappeared in the world, it was inevitable that countless experts would soon arrive to explore this place. Even if he did not take the Source Crystal mine for himself, it would only end up in the hands of others.

In other words, it was only a matter of time before the Demonic Warhammer saw the light of day again.

What no one could have expected was that, over countless years, the Demonic Warhammer had actually developed its own sentience, gaining the ability to take on a true form and emerge into the world.

As these thoughts flashed by, in the next instant, Yang Kai’s Sword Intent shifted, turning from defense to offense.

“Myriad Sword radiance, chase the moon and swallow the wolf!”

A rapid chorus of slicing sounds tore through the air.

Countless sword lights rained down like a torrential storm upon the Artifact Spirit, forcing it to stagger back again and again. Demonic Qi rolled across its body, but it wasn’t harmed in the slightest.

After all, it was the Demonic Weapon Warhammer of ancient times given form. That ancient demonic weapon was at least at the level of an Imperial Treasure, incomparably sturdy. Unless the Demonic Weapon Warhammer itself was destroyed, no method could harm it—unless one used Divine Sense to directly attack its consciousness and erase its will.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai had expended too much Divine Sense just now when collecting the Source Crystal mine, and it was difficult to gather it again in a short time to use a soul secret technique.

He could only defend by attacking.

As soon as the sword lights appeared, Yang Kai immediately retreated, flashing to Ye Qinghan’s side, grabbing her with one hand and shouting in a low voice, “Go!”

As soon as he spoke, the two of them shot upward at great speed, following the flow of Spiritual Qi straight toward the sky.

Above, at the eighteen Spring Sources, the many martial artists looked at each other, their expressions ugly.

“Where are the Source Crystals? Why are the Source Crystals gone?”

“Damn it, why did the Source Crystals stop erupting? What happened?”

“Who knows what happened? It looks like the other Spring Sources aren’t producing Source Crystals either.”

The martial artists looked around, chattering noisily, all feeling unsatisfied.

After all, this kind of good fortune—Source Crystals falling from the sky—was something that might only happen once in a thousand years. And this time, they’d gotten Upper-Level and Middle-Level Source Crystals, filling their baskets to the brim and feeling overjoyed. Suddenly, the Source Crystals were gone.

Now, nothing but pure Spiritual Qi gushed from the eighteen Spring Sources—nothing else at all.

How could everyone not be frustrated?

“Did something happen down below again?” someone guessed.

“Why don’t we go down and take a look? Maybe there’s some heaven-defying opportunity waiting for us,” someone suggested.

At these words, everyone’s expressions changed.

Before, everyone had been busy collecting Source Crystals and had no time to care about anything else. Now that the Source Crystals were gone, of course they wanted to investigate below. Eighteen Spirit Sources, countless Source Crystals—if there wasn’t something good down there, only a fool would believe it.

So everyone was tempted.

Tempted as they were, everyone still understood the principle that the bird that sticks its head out gets shot. So they looked at each other, but no one dared to be the first to try.

“Ahem… Brother Sihai, your cultivation is profound and your virtue is respected. Why don’t you take the lead this time, and we’ll follow you down?” a middle-aged man suddenly said to another old man.

The old man named Qi Sihai snorted coldly and said with displeasure, “Brother Wuhu, are you joking? When we were collecting Source Crystals just now, I didn’t see you asking me to take the lead. But now that there’s danger, you want me to go first? Are you insulting my intelligence, or your own?”

Zhou Wuhu coughed and said, “Forget it if you’re unwilling, but no need to be so sharp-tongued. Did you not rinse your mouth after eating?”

Qi Sihai said coldly, “I’m not so stupid as to let myself be used by others!”

Zhou Wuhu curled his lip, then cupped his fists toward the Eight Directions Sect and said, “Brother Luo, I see your cultivation is extraordinary and your means are heaven-defying. You must be a man of great fortune. Are you interested in going down to take a look?”

No one knew when Luo Yuan had returned. Though he looked battered after fighting with the two elders, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, he was full of spirit and seemed to have gained a lot.

Looking around, the people from Fei Sheng Palace were nowhere to be seen. Maybe Luo Yuan had driven them off.

"You are truly devious, old man. If you want to go down, go yourself—don’t try to drag Senior Brother Luo in!" The round-faced woman from Eight Directions Sect glared at Zhou Wuhu and shouted.

Zhou Wuhu’s face darkened and he snorted, “Little girl, mind your words. Can’t you show some respect for your elders? I’m already old—can’t you see my white hair and beard?”

The round-faced woman snorted, “Since you’re so old, why not find a place to lie down and wait quietly for death? Why run around everywhere—are you in a hurry to die?”

“You little girl… you’ll be the death of me!” Zhou Wuhu trembled all over with anger.

Qi Sihai watched from the side, gloating and laughing heartily.

“Something’s wrong!” Luo Yuan, who had been silent, suddenly frowned at the Upper-Level Spring Source in front of him, looking as if he was facing a great enemy.

“What?” The round-faced woman looked at him.

Luo Yuan’s expression grew even more serious. Suddenly, he shouted, “Retreat!”

As soon as he spoke, he urged his Origin Qi, wrapped up several Eight Directions Sect disciples, and instantly flashed a hundred zhang away.

Gurgle gurgle…

At the Upper-Level Spring Source, bubbles suddenly appeared, and the whole Spring Source seemed to boil.

“What’s going on?” Everyone looked confused, staring at the Spring Source.

At that moment, a figure suddenly burst out, accompanied by a splash of water.

“There’s someone down there?”

“When did that guy go down?”

“Hiss… it’s that walking disaster!”

Everyone cried out in alarm. When they saw it was Yang Kai, their faces turned ugly. They wondered if the sudden stop of the Source Crystals had something to do with him, but no one dared to ask.

“Why did he come out of our Spirit Source?” The round-faced woman looked at Yang Kai in confusion, her brows furrowed.

“So that’s it!” Luo Yuan seemed to understand something and said thoughtfully, “It looks like these eighteen Spirit Sources are actually connected.”

“Is that so… Senior Brother Luo really is clever.” The round-faced woman smiled sweetly, gazing at Luo Yuan with undisguised admiration.

The other Eight Directions Sect disciples looked on in embarrassment, knowing the round-faced woman was hopelessly smitten.

As soon as Yang Kai appeared, he glanced around, then immediately flashed to Hua Qingsi and the others.

“Master…” Liu Yan’s beautiful eyes were grave as she looked at the area below the Spring Source and said softly, “I don’t know why, but I suddenly have a strange feeling, as if down there…”

“Yes, there’s another existence like you,” Yang Kai answered quickly.

“Taken form?” Liu Yan’s delicate body trembled, clearly excited.

There weren’t many Artifact Spirits that could take form and possess their own intelligence. All such beings were of the same kind. Hearing there was another like herself, Liu Yan was naturally stirred, eager to know how the other had taken form and how much intelligence it possessed.

“It’s very dangerous—don’t provoke him!” Yang Kai said as he set Ye Qinghan down and took out a handful of Spiritual Pills from his Spatial Ring, stuffing them into his mouth.

Splash…

Another sound rang out as the Artifact Spirit shot out of the Spirit Source after Yang Kai, its aura violent and sinister. Its whole body was a pitch-black shadow, flickering and indistinct, with only a pair of blood-red eyes.

“Haa… who’s that now!”

“Looks so fierce.”

“Hahaha, look at that troublemaker fleeing in panic—seems this guy is really strong! It’d be great if he killed that scourge!”

“Exactly, exactly! Best if he drags that Luo kid from Eight Directions Sect in too. Then we can just sit back and watch the tigers fight, hehehe…”

After the Artifact Spirit appeared, its gaze remained locked on Yang Kai, as if he were the only thing in the world it cared about. It had no interest in anyone else.

It raised its hand and slashed fiercely toward Yang Kai’s position.

A pitch-black beam of light, as if it devoured all the light in the world, broke through space and shot straight at Yang Kai’s head.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. With a slight lift of his hand, the Golden Blood Threads net that had been covering the Spirit Source spread out.

Boom…

The pitch-black attack struck the net, and the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth trembled. The Golden Blood Threads net couldn’t withstand the attack and instantly collapsed.

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he withdrew all the Golden Blood Threads, swept his sword out, and sent a huge sword light to meet the slash.

Boom boom boom…

The two energies collided and exploded, sending violent shockwaves in all directions, making it hard for anyone to keep their footing.

“This guy is really strong!”

Seeing the Artifact Spirit’s methods, everyone’s expressions changed. In the distance, Luo Yuan’s eyes also narrowed.

Yang Kai took out another handful of Spiritual Pills and tossed them into his mouth like candy, chewing and swallowing as he mumbled, “Brother Luo, I found you a worthy opponent. Want to test his mettle?”

Luo Yuan snorted, “Not interested. I’ve already mastered that Secret Technique.”

“Is that so!” Yang Kai shouted, “Then you should definitely try it out—see how powerful it is!”

“You’re such a scoundrel!” The round-faced woman shook her little fist at Yang Kai from afar and said through gritted teeth, “You can’t beat him, so you want to drag Senior Brother Luo in. Shameless!”

“What use is face? Life is more important, little girl!” Yang Kai looked completely unashamed, even proud, making everyone look down on him.

“Enough, enough!” Yang Kai curled his lip and said unhurriedly, “Since you don’t want an Imperial Treasure, I’ll just take care of it myself!”

“What?”

“Imperial Treasure?”

“Where’s the Imperial Treasure?”

“Give it to me! I want it! Eldest Brother Yang, Master Yang…”

Yang Kai grinned, pointing at the Artifact Spirit and said, “All of you are seasoned cultivators—can’t you tell that fellow isn’t even a living being?”

“What do you mean by that, Brother Yang?” Qi Sihai’s eyes narrowed as he asked in a deep voice.

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “That fellow is an Imperial Treasure that has taken form!”
