## Chapter 73 — Senior Sister’s Sincere Heart Toward Me

Pairs of eyes fixed intently on the leading Su Yan and the young man she was supporting, Yang Kai. A wave of envy and jealousy spread swiftly, thick with the acrid sting of bitterness.

Before today, none had ever seen Su Yan show such closeness to any man. Even among the few outstanding Core Disciples, none had been granted such an honor.

Su Yan cultivated the Ice Heart Technique, her heart frozen for many years. Normally, it was rare even to see her speak to other men, let alone show intimacy.

Every disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, regardless of strength or status, treated her with utmost caution, fearing to offend this beauty. Yet now, she was actively supporting a third-stage Open Origin Realm youth, her pure white hand gently resting on his waist. Her icy face was tinged with a faint blush, making her seem all the more alluring.

The usually aloof lady suddenly felt much closer.

But countless male disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion felt their hearts shatter, as if their revered goddess had been desecrated.

And the one who dared to desecrate the goddess stood right before them, supported by her, inhaling her fragrance, feeling the softness of her hand, enjoying privileges no one else could.

“Killing intent!” Yang Kai’s lips curled into a strange smile, his demeanor calm as he walked forward alongside Su Yan, carrying an air of one borrowing a tiger’s might.

A figure suddenly blocked their path — a man of graceful bearing and delicate features. His starry eyes gazed at Su Yan with tender affection, yet beneath it lurked deep jealousy and displeasure.

Su Yan halted and looked up at him.

“Step aside!” came the usual cold, detached voice, flat and devoid of any worldly emotion.

The man gave a bitter smile and shook his head. “Junior Sister, do not trouble Senior Brother. I am only fulfilling my duty.”

This man was Jie Hongchen, the second strongest among the young generation of Lingxiao Pavilion.

“Step aside!” Su Yan repeated, unwilling to utter another word.

Jie Hongchen sighed helplessly. “Junior Sister, these few cannot leave yet! They have violated sect rules. Until the Elders’ Council decides, no one may take them away.”

“Sect rules?” Yang Kai stepped forward, sneering. “May I ask which rule we have broken, Senior Brother?”

Jie Hongchen cast him a disdainful glance. “Gathering to fight, assault and murder, contempt for the Law Enforcement Hall — any one of these is enough to expel you from Lingxiao Pavilion.”

“Gathering to fight?” Su Yan took over the words. “Fighting whom? If it was a gathering to fight, there should be opponents, yes? Then why has your Law Enforcement Hall only arrested one side? Where are the others?”

Jie Hongchen’s face darkened, unable to answer. The other side was Wei Zhuang and his group, whom they dared not touch.

“Assault and murder? Where is the corpse of the murdered?”

Jie Hongchen forced a bitter smile and hurried to explain, “An attempted assault and murder, but fortunately intercepted by our Law Enforcement Hall, so no major incident occurred.”

“Disciples sparring within the sect bear responsibility for their own lives! By your logic, every pair of sparring disciples is attempting assault and murder? Your Law Enforcement Hall has so many people, yet do you have nothing better to do than arrest the entire Lingxiao Pavilion?” Su Yan’s expression was cold, her tone icy. “As for contempt of the Law Enforcement Hall — if your Hall were truly just and fair, who would dare to disrespect it? I fear this so-called representative of sect rules has long become a tool for some to vie for power, destroying its own dignity. No wonder others trample on it!”

“Junior Sister,” Jie Hongchen’s smile was dry, his handsome face marked with deep helplessness, “must you be so blunt?”

“You know well in your heart what is right and wrong.”

Jie Hongchen’s expression darkened as he lowered his voice. “Junior Sister, I have always been sincere toward you. Why must you make things difficult for me?”

Su Yan replied calmly, “If Senior Brother said this to Zhao Feixue, I wonder what she would think?”

Zhao Feixue, like Jie Hongchen and Su Yan, was a Core Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. Yet her relationship with Jie Hongchen had always been ambiguous.

Jie Hongchen trembled, gazing deeply at Su Yan with a face full of pain and helplessness. Then his eyes shifted sharply to Yang Kai, filled suddenly with venomous hatred.

Yang Kai remained composed, meeting his gaze with fearless resolve.

“Your name is Yang Kai?” Jie Hongchen asked, suppressing the bitterness in his heart. Anyone seeing the woman they loved so intimately supporting another man would surely feel tormented.

“What does Senior Brother wish to say?”

“I know you started this trouble. Without you, none of this would have happened. If you do not wish to implicate Senior Sister Su, then obediently return to your cell. That will save me the trouble of acting.” Jie Hongchen spoke coldly. Unable to persuade Su Yan or confront her, he sought a breakthrough through Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“What are you laughing at?” Jie Hongchen frowned.

Though covered in blood and looking disheveled, Yang Kai laughed as he slowly reached out, grasping the jade-like hand Su Yan had placed on his waist. He gently patted it in his palm, then turned to Su Yan, his face filled with tender affection.

“I do not wish to implicate Senior Sister either, but she has shown me sincere heart. I cannot bear to disappoint her, so I must let her have her way.”

Jie Hongchen’s face suddenly turned pale. Su Yan stood frozen, her delicate face clouded with confusion.

Li Yuntian and the others’ jaws dropped to the floor, their throats making strange choking sounds, unable to utter a single coherent word.

Among the hundreds of Law Enforcement Hall disciples surrounding them, each felt their heart split in two, stunned into silence.

“Senior Sister, isn’t that so?” Yang Kai, seemingly oblivious to the gravity of the situation, added salt to the wound.

Jie Hongchen watched Su Yan anxiously, fearing she would give an answer he did not want to hear.

Suddenly, Su Yan snapped back to herself.

She had never been treated so lightly by any man. Her hand was held freely in his palm, the rough calluses rubbing against her skin, sending sharp stings and a faint warmth.

Su Yan’s anger flared! She nearly struck Yang Kai away on the spot, but then understanding his intent, she suppressed her fury and nodded slightly, openly admitting, “Yes.”

As she spoke, she unleashed a hidden force into Yang Kai’s meridians.

Yang Kai groaned softly, two streams of blood suddenly spurting from his nostrils.

“Why are you bleeding?” Su Yan asked, producing a pristine white silk handkerchief to gently wipe his face.

“It’s nothing, nothing!” Yang Kai’s heart chilled. Though Senior Sister appeared calm, if her bottom line were crossed, she would strike without mercy.

“You…” Jie Hongchen’s jealousy nearly drove him mad. If he had doubted Su Yan’s admission before, the scene before him left no room for question.

He had never seen Su Yan treat a man so tenderly. Never had he seen her hand held in a man’s palm without resistance.

If she were not truly willing, how could Yang Kai have succeeded against her strength?

“Junior Sister, with your heavenly talent, how could you fall for such a worthless man?”

“Who do you call worthless?” Yang Kai and Su Yan turned simultaneously, their faces dark as the storm before the night.
