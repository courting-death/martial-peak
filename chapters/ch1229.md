## Chapter 1229 — Yuan Control Art

"Boom..." A thunderous crack echoed as the pitch-black Demonic Flame wrapped around Yang Kai's fist took a heavy hit, scattering in all directions, and his whole body was slammed backward by a tremendous force.

In that place of the previously empty void, a faint figure weirdly materialized; as Yang Kai's form retreated, a sound like bones breaking rang out, and the man gave a muffled grunt, evidently quite annoyed.

"It's you!" Yang Kai barked; after exchanging a blow he instantly recognized who had attempted to ambush him.

It turned out to be Lu Ye of Liu Yun Valley—the one who had left earlier!

Yang Kai had personally seen him depart from the valley and speed away; he couldn't fathom what means the man had used to secretly remain here undetected. After the Red Candle Fruit ripened, he even infiltrated the valley and, like Yang Kai, set his sights on the Red Candle Base.

No need to guess—the Medicine Pill Sect disciple had certainly been slain by him.

While Yang Kai was stunned by the other's methods, Lu Ye himself looked somewhat puzzled. The faint silhouette did not vanish this time but stood within the red mist observing Yang Kai; after a while he said, "You are a strangely peculiar man!"

Yang Kai sneered, "You're the strange one!"

Lu Ye had never expected a First Stage of the Saint King Realm to survive his ambush and even trade a blow with him unharmed. Yang Kai likewise had not anticipated Lu Ye's methods to be so fiendish and indefensible; if not for his abnormal Divine Sense, his end would have been no better than that slain Medicine Pill Sect disciple.

At this moment both felt a measure of apprehension toward the other, which only intensified their determination to kill.

"I haven't offended Liu Yun Valley, nor you—why are you targeting me?" Yang Kai voiced his confusion; having inexplicably provoked such an enemy, he wasn't afraid but wanted to know the reason.

"Hmph—Liu Yun Valley!" Lu Ye snorted, a tone of faint disdain in his voice that left Yang Kai momentarily stunned. He said little more, only coldly: "Blame yourself for taking what you shouldn't have! Otherwise you'd be a promising talent, far superior to those vulgar types out there."

Yang Kai's expression grew strange; he inwardly felt this man's arrogance was sky-high. This Lu Ye gave an impression completely different from Daiyuan's earlier description—almost as if they were two different people.

Moreover, Yang Kai had no idea what he possessed that made the other so covetous. In the Flowing Flame Sandland he had gained many fine things—several were not inferior to the Red Candle Fruit, even surpassing it—yet the man hadn't even tried to seize the Red Candle Fruit, clearly not in need of that miraculous medicine. What could possibly have him so obsessed, repeatedly targeting Yang Kai?

However, Yang Kai had no intention of asking. Even if he were to inquire, given the importance of that thing to the other party, he certainly wouldn’t receive an answer. Now, in this red mist–filled valley, only he and Lu Ye remained—there was bound to be a battle between them.

Hiss...

A faint sound came from behind; Yang Kai's hair rose on end. Even though he had braced himself, the unforeseeable ambush sent a cold sweat across him. Unthinking, a layer of Demonic Flame flared around his body as he turned toward the source.

In the red mist a blurry figure oddly appeared, a deadwood-like great hand thrust stealthily toward him like a sharpened blade.

A long sword of rolling Demonic Flame manifested. Yang Kai struck with his Profound Heaven Sword; the blade met the deadwood hand and the hand shattered, the blurry figure flickered and vanished, yet the sword's radiance also collapsed.

"Your Saint Yuan is intriguing—possessing such power. I never imagined the world held a Saint King like you!" Lu Ye's voice came again from behind, laced with mockery. Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and turned to find the man had been standing motionless there the whole time, as if the deadwood hand and the blurry figure that had ambushed him were not his true form.

What kind of artifice was this?

Startled, Yang Kai no longer dared be careless. Just as he prepared to take the initiative, countless blurry figures he'd seen before suddenly appeared from all directions—each indistinguishable from the next, as if cast from the same mold—and they surged toward Yang Kai. Amid the onrush, one formidable Martial Skill after another detonated, all striking at him.

Each of those Martial Skills was a genuine attack, without the slightest sense of illusion.

Yang Kai's face shifted; he produced the Purple Shield and guarded at his side, while wave after wave of sword light cleaved out, forming an airtight defensive web beside him.

Hisss...

Wherever the sword light passed, the blurry figures dissolved into nothing and the incoming killing moves were all intercepted, yet the surrounding figures seemed inexhaustible, endless, coming in ceaselessly, wearing Yang Kai down and causing a headache.

He had never seen so bizarre a method and for the moment could find no counter. But after engaging with the opponent a while, Yang Kai vaguely detected some inconsistencies.

Each blurry figure carried Lu Ye's aura—it was not some other person. They looked like residual afterimages of Lu Ye's body, or clones of him; half real, half illusory, unfathomable.

He slashed out another blade to stem their approach, then seized a gap to bite his index finger. A drop of Golden Blood welled out, and Yang Kai quickly smeared it on his left eye.

The World-Ending Demon Eye reappeared; an invisible majesty rolled out, and what his left eye beheld was no longer hazy. In an instant it pierced the red mist's veil and revealed everything within—those blurry figures all cleared up at that moment.

Indeed, they were all Lu Ye; only under the World-Ending Demon Eye, which could see through all falsehoods, did those figures emit a faint abnormal red glow.

Only one figure in the distance remained unchanged!

Yang Kai's gaze immediately fixed on that figure—if he was correct, that was Lu Ye's true body; the earlier figures were created by some special means.

"Oh? Innate talent?" A mingled expression of shock and anger crossed Lu Ye's face as he fixed his stare on Yang Kai's left eye, as if he'd discovered something extraordinary; greed plainly showed.

With his experience and insight he naturally saw that Yang Kai's left eye was not cultivated by any technique but was innate. Such natural divine power was exceedingly rare—something even he had never possessed.

That golden pupil, narrow and slitted, was clearly a treasure. After a moment of eye contact, Lu Ye felt his soul in the Sea of Consciousness roil, as if being drawn away; alarmed, he hurried to steady his heart and with difficulty calmed the turmoil.

Deeply wary yet excited, his face grew animated—if he could seize Yang Kai's left eye, it would be like adding wings to a tiger.

He truly had not expected this First Stage Saint King to present him with so many surprises.

Moreover, the other's eye seemed able to see through illusion and reality alike; with that his original plan could not be carried out. With a thought, the scattered phantoms wavered, condensed into streams of light, and returned to his true body.

The next moment, an astonishing burst of Divine Sense power erupted from Lu Ye, forming into a sharp long spike that drove straight at Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai felt as if his Sea of Consciousness's defenses were about to be torn open. Alarmed, he held nothing back and unleashed his Divine Sense—perilously blocking the opponent's fierce assault.

Though he barely arrested it, Yang Kai still felt dizzy; his Divine Sense had been slightly injured in that instant.

It seemed that when Lu Ye had ambushed him before the Red Candle Fruit matured, he had not used his full strength—this man was actually a level above him in Divine Sense cultivation!

Dizzy and reeling, Yang Kai knew the situation was dire. He swung his sword and volleys of Demonic Flame shot out in all directions, breaking the red mist's seal and striking into the void.

A red curtain unfurled overhead, suffused with murderous and malevolent qi. Lu Ye's cackling laughter rang in Yang Kai's ears, stirring his blood—he intended to seize Yang Kai while he was unprepared and thoroughly probe the extraordinary things hidden within him.

Yang Kai would not allow it. With a thought, the Demonic Flame spheres he had unleashed merged into inky black beams that sped like arrows and converged on a point in the red light curtain.

"Yuan Control Art!" Lu Ye's face darkened, his mood unsettled.

Yang Kai's every deed astonished him. Beyond innate talent, his Saint Yuan and Divine Sense were both abnormal; now, to be able to employ the Yuan Control Art was far beyond Lu Ye's expectations.

Although Yang Kai's Yuan Control Art appeared crude, as if newly realized, it was not something a Saint King could master. Only one who reached the Origin Returning Realm and developed a certain understanding of Shi could possibly accomplish this.

Even so, Origin Returning Realm experts who could continue to control their Saint Yuan outside the body were extremely rare; each was a prodigy destined for a brilliant future.

The Yuan Control Art Lu Ye spoke of was precisely what Yang Kai had struggled to comprehend these past few days.

Previously, his use of Saint Yuan had been based on certain Martial Skills; sometimes Saint Yuan would be sent out and that was that—whether it struck depended on both sides' reactions and the opponent's defenses.

But in the days before the Red Candle Fruit ripened, Yang Kai had grasped a deeper control over his Saint Yuan. This required not only profound cognition of Saint Yuan but also a powerful Divine Sense as support—without it the Yuan Control Art would be a joke.
