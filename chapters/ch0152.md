## Chapter 152 — The Pinnacle

In the crowd, Lan Chudie was trembling all over, her body turning purple from the cold. Yet, within her beautiful eyes shone an indomitable will. This gaze resembled that of Yang Kai at times, but hers held a chilling coldness, lacking the fierce intensity he often displayed.

"Did I fail?" Lan Chudie felt a bitter taste in her heart. With her strength at the Qi Movement Realm Eighth Layer, she had climbed over three thousand steps, a feat unparalleled among the disciples of the three sects.

What supported her was her unyielding spirit and the obsession to grow stronger.

But now, she had been brought down by an irresistible force, leaving her unwilling to accept this outcome.

Why did this happen? If only I had enough time, I would surely reach the peak. Why was I sent back? Lan Chudie clenched her fists tightly, her long nails digging into her palms.

Only pain could calm her turbulent emotions.

"Junior Sister, are you alright?" Hu Jiao’er noticed Lan Chudie's abnormality and asked with concern.

Lan Chudie slowly shook her head, a drop of unwilling tear slipping down from her lowered eyelids.

Yang Kai continued to advance, his eyes fixed solely on the peak in the clouds, unaware of the events occurring behind him with the Hu sisters.

No longer needing to worry about others, Yang Kai suddenly increased his speed.

This place was where the cold attribute energy surged. He stepped up rapidly, almost without pause. The cold attribute energy entered his body, and under the refinement of the True Yang Technique, it was absorbed after completing a full cycle.

After passing five hundred steps, the energy changed, and Yang Kai's pace quickened.

While the cold attribute energy still needed to be resolved, the Yang attribute energy was merely absorbed, making the process much simpler.

Step by step, he climbed higher, getting closer to the clouds.

However, with each step, the pressure on him grew stronger. With every layer he ascended, the energy rushing into his body increased significantly.

If it weren't for the cultivation method he practiced being suitable, and if he hadn't stored so much Yang Liquid in his Dantian, Yang Kai would not have been able to remain so calm.

As he climbed higher, Yang Kai felt something was off.

This trial was indeed becoming increasingly difficult. However, it had not yet reached a point where one would be stopped. If this was truly a test of inheritance, it should not be so simple.

After some thought, Yang Kai's mind stirred, and he unsealed the Earth Demon trapped within him. Previously, the Earth Demon had been quite noisy, trying to persuade Yang Kai to use the virgin bodies of the Hu sisters to cultivate evil martial techniques. In a fit of anger, Yang Kai had sealed its soul, only to release it now.

The Earth Demon indeed dared not bring that matter up again. Yang Kai voiced his doubts, but the Earth Demon could not provide any answers.

To prevent it from disturbing his state of mind again, Yang Kai sealed it once more after asking.

No matter what trials lay ahead, as long as he reached that point, he would naturally face them. Overthinking would be of no help.

Understanding this, Yang Kai felt a sudden lightness in his heart. Even his body felt much more relaxed, as if the trials here had become simpler with the shift in his mindset.

Day after day of climbing, after resting three times, Yang Kai finally reached the highest point.

Surrounded by swirling clouds and mist, it felt as if he had entered an otherworldly realm. Looking back, the steps he had taken were etched in his mind, ethereal enough to evoke a dreamlike sensation.

Before him lay the final ten steps. As long as he completed these ten steps, he would reach the peak.

He lifted his foot and stepped forward.

Nine steps, eight steps, seven steps...

Yang Kai's mind recalled the joy of the past few days, followed by the determination of the recent days.

Six steps, five steps, four steps...

As he traced back through his memories, he recalled the changes he had undergone after obtaining the Wordless Black Book.

Three steps, two steps...

A scene from three years ago surfaced, causing his otherwise steady heart to ripple with emotion.

Yang Kai's foot hovered in the air, pausing on the last step.

Just one more step, and he would reach the clouds.

Yet, Yang Kai did not dare to step down.

For reasons he could not articulate, he felt that if he maintained this state of mind, taking that step would either lead to death or severe injury!

It was an instinct.

Taking a deep breath, he silently operated the True Yang Technique, holding his position without moving. He felt the gentle breeze against his face, sensing the turmoil within him gradually calming, the fragments of his memories settling once more.

He did not know how long it had been, but when Yang Kai opened his eyes again, there was no trace of hesitation or fear in his gaze—only determination.

He stepped down.

The heavens rumbled, an invisible pressure suddenly descending upon Yang Kai, a force akin to a sovereign's might.

Yang Kai's body instinctively lowered, his legs bending as if he would kneel on the ground. Yet, just as his knees were half a foot from the ground, he halted.

Sweat instantly soaked his clothes, his flesh convulsing in a grotesque spasm. This pressure was not much different from the heavenly pressure he had felt while cultivating the Body Tempering Chapter.

However, it lacked some of the nuances; if compared, the sensation from cultivating the Body Tempering Chapter was even more intense, as it was a rebellion against the restraints of heaven and earth, while now he faced the pressure of a strong opponent.

In the depths of his being, Yang Kai felt as if an eye in the sky was slowly opening, watching him.

His bent body gradually straightened. Yang Kai's veins bulged, his face flushed red, and with his resistance, the pressure grew stronger.

A muffled groan escaped his lips, the taste of blood filling his mouth as he had already sustained some internal injuries.

"I can withstand the might of heaven and earth; what’s more, you are not heaven and earth!" Yang Kai gritted his teeth, his bones creaking as he slowly lifted his other foot, inching toward that final step.

It felt like an instant, yet also like an eternity. When Yang Kai finally managed to place both feet on the last step, his body straightened at last.

The pressure on him suddenly lightened, and in that moment, Yang Kai broke free from the invisible shackles!

A massive surge of energy flooded into Yang Kai's body, causing his Yuan Qi to surge violently. Moments later, he wiped the corner of his mouth with a grin.

He had reached the Open Origin Realm, Eighth Layer!

Climbing those endless steps had unexpectedly allowed him to break through a layer of cultivation, which was not without reward.

Looking up again, Yang Kai saw the palace hidden in the clouds.

Yet below the palace, there were still layers of steps.

However, the number of these steps was not as many as the ones he had just traversed. A quick glance revealed they numbered only a hundred.

"Is this the second layer of the trial?" Yang Kai murmured to himself.

Without hesitation, he stepped forward.

As he set foot on the first step, a wave of scorching Yang attribute energy appeared beside him, resembling a red thread visible to the naked eye.

Yang Kai's expression turned suspicious as he reached out to grasp it.

Operating the True Yang Technique, he directly absorbed it.

"Strange!" Yang Kai found it hard to comprehend. If the second layer of the trial was like this, wouldn’t it be redundant?

This was something he had experienced countless times in the past few days; previously, the energy had surged into his feet, but now it merely floated before him. There was not much difference.

Not delving deeper, as he could not discern any clues for now, he continued to ascend step by step. With each layer he passed, a Yang attribute energy would appear beside him, which he absorbed along the way, turning it into his own.

Climbing the hundred steps added two drops of Yang Liquid to his Dantian.

Upon reaching the ninety-ninth step, Yang Kai noticed something was off. On the one hundredth step, there was an icy barrier blocking his path.

Reaching out to touch it, he felt an extreme chill. Moreover, this chill carried a strange quality that even his True Yang Technique could not easily resolve.

What was even stranger was that when Yang Kai's hand touched this icy barrier, the Yang energy he had absorbed from the previous hundred steps surged uncontrollably from his Dantian, dissipating into the air.

In the next moment, Yang Kai's vision blurred. When he regained his senses, he found himself back at the bottom of the first step.

Furrowing his brows, he looked up, and indeed, it was the hundred steps he had just traversed.

But why had he come back down? Was the icy barrier on the one hundredth step the crux of this trial?

If that was the case, it meant he had to break this icy barrier to pass the trial.

How to break it? The Yang energy should be the nemesis of this icy barrier; perhaps he could give it a try.

After much contemplation, Yang Kai moved his feet again, retracing his steps up the hundred steps.

As before, each step brought forth a Yang attribute energy, which Yang Kai absorbed completely. Before long, he stood once more before the icy barrier.

Taking a deep breath, he clenched his fists, circulating his Yuan Qi, and unleashed a Flame Yang Explosion.

With a thunderous boom, the fierce Yuan Qi surged into the icy barrier, but it sank like a stone in the sea, causing not a single ripple.

Instead, Yang Kai was sent back down again, the energy he had just absorbed dissipating into nothingness.

His Flame Yang Explosion was ineffective; even if he used the Mark of the Stars, it would likely not break this icy barrier. Where was the key?

Yang Kai squinted, pondering for a moment, and suddenly realized something.

On his third attempt, Yang Kai paused at each step, grasping the energy that appeared like a thread in his hand.

He no longer absorbed it but simply held it.

As the layers increased, the red threads in his hand multiplied, becoming increasingly violent, even beginning to scorch Yang Kai's hand.

This was quite unbelievable for a practitioner of the True Yang Technique, but in reality, this Yang energy was indeed peculiar; if he did not absorb it, it would become agitated, constantly attacking Yang Kai.

Enduring the pain in his hand, Yang Kai remained silent.

Strangely, as time passed, the Yang energy he held began to stabilize, as if it had found a home, no longer struggling or resisting, and ceased its attacks.

A smile crept onto Yang Kai's lips; he felt he had found the right method.

As the layers increased, the Yang energy in his hand had formed a fireball. Yet even so, Yang Kai suffered no further injuries.

Standing once more before the ninety-ninth step, Yang Kai gently sent the fireball into the icy barrier before him.

This time, he was not sent back down.

The icy barrier, now infused with the absorbed Yang energy, emitted a series of cracking sounds, and soon, like a mirror, it shattered into countless fissures, revealing a magnificent palace before Yang Kai.

The path was clear!
