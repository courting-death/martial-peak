## Chapter 2364 — Devouring Heaven and Earth

Blood streamed from Yang Kai’s right eye, turning everything he saw into dazzling gold. This was the wound left when his pupil technique was broken.

He simply wiped it away and snorted coldly, “I’ll send you on your way!”

With a sweeping motion of both hands, a massive, unparalleled Moon Blade formed, trembling slightly before shooting toward Yao Changjun. The Moon Blade was like the scythe of death, leaving devastation in its wake.

In his madness, Yao Changjun instinctively sensed the approaching danger. Enduring the piercing pain, he made a move, and the five-colored spear appeared in his palm once more. He stepped forward, thrusting and sending it out, and five-colored mysterious light shot forth instantly.

Boom boom boom…

The mysterious light and Moon Blade collided, and the violent energy shock changed the color of heaven and earth. The newly formed island within several li shattered and quickly collapsed.

The Moon Blade vanished; behind the five-colored light, Yao Changjun’s face twisted with madness. Seizing the opportunity, he charged forth, his expression filled with deep-seated hatred and resolve to fight to the death.

Yang Kai raised his brow and shouted angrily, “Instead of stubborn resistance, why not obediently accept death!”

He hadn’t expected Yao Changjun to remain so tenacious even with his Sea of Consciousness collapsing. It seemed he had underestimated the strength of the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert. If Yao Changjun were truly unscathed, even if Yang Kai unsealed the Demonic Qi, he might not be a match.

Experts who have cultivated to this level are truly never simple.

“Hammer, come!” Yang Kai reached out into the void, and a pitch-black warhammer suddenly appeared in his palm.

The Demonic Warhammer!

This demonic weapon was originally the weapon of the Ancient Giant Demon, sealed beneath the eighteen Spring Sources outside Fenglin City, filled with terrifying demonic power. After Yang Kai claimed it, he tossed it into the Small Xuan Realm for his Incarnation to refine. Even someone as strong as Yang Kai dared not covet it, fearing its demonic power would trigger the seal within him.

But now was the perfect time to use it.

As the warhammer entered his hand, Yang Kai felt a strange sensation.

The Demonic Warhammer seemed to come alive, transmitting waves of excitement and joy as soon as he grasped it. It resonated perfectly with the Demonic Qi in his body, allowing Yang Kai to wield it effortlessly without refining.

With the warhammer in hand, Yang Kai seemed to witness the Ancient Giant Demon standing alone, battling ancient powerhouses with his own strength. The scene was bloody and chaotic, heaven and earth shattered, and one after another, mighty ancient experts fell beneath the warhammer, their bodies and souls destroyed. The Ancient Giant Demon stood tall, killing intent surging, gazing over the world, unmatched!

The agitation in Yang Kai’s heart caused by the Demonic Qi inexplicably calmed. For a moment, he felt a sense of pride and supremacy.

The aggressive Yao Changjun charging at him seemed as laughable as an ant.

He gazed at his opponent with contempt, slowly raising the warhammer. A mysterious thread of the laws of heaven and earth stirred.

Yao Changjun’s expression suddenly changed, his face drained of blood.

He had no idea what had happened to Yang Kai, only seeing him suddenly produce a warhammer-shaped Secret Treasure, and then his entire demeanor and aura transformed.

In that moment, he seemed to see an insurmountable mountain standing before him. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t see what lay beyond it.

Panic seized him.

He wanted to retreat, but the arrow was already nocked and had to be released. His entire energy was in turmoil; if he retreated now, Yang Kai wouldn’t need to act—his own Dao Heart would collapse instantly.

A faint killing intent lingered around him, and as he approached, it grew denser and clearer, almost becoming tangible, slicing painfully into his skin.

He would die! He would definitely die!

This thought suddenly sprang up in Yao Changjun’s mind, throwing his spirit into chaos. His already fragile Sea of Consciousness finally collapsed with a roar.

“Ah!” Yao Changjun roared madly, “Even in death, I’ll drag you down with me!”

As he spoke, he poured all his strength into the five-colored spear, his body wrapped in five-colored light, his momentum soaring. All hesitation vanished, replaced by resolute determination.

This strike unleashed his peak power, and Yao Changjun’s previously panicked eyes now shone with dazzling light.

Yang Kai’s face was expressionless as he brought the warhammer down.

A murderous intent surged, condensing into the will of the warhammer, and swept toward Yao Changjun with unstoppable force.

A thunderous sound erupted over the nameless sea, and a mass of pitch-black light exploded, as if devouring heaven and earth.

At the same time, another mass of five-colored light burst forth, standing in opposition to the black light.

The two lights clashed and collided, stirring up wind and clouds over the sea. The already shattered island was pulverized into dust, vanishing without a trace. The nearby waterspouts were also scattered by the massive shockwave.

Within tens of thousands of li, tidal waves surged and tsunamis roared. Countless fish and Demonic Beasts dwelling in the vast sea were swept up by the white light, vanishing without a trace.

At the very center of the energy collision, a pit hundreds of zhang deep appeared on the sea’s surface; the water seemed to vaporize instantly.

After less than ten breaths, the pitch-black light suddenly surged, devouring the five-colored glow completely.

“Why? Damn heavens, I refuse to accept this!”

A furious roar echoed through the clouds, then all was settled.

The pitch-black and five-colored lights filling heaven and earth vanished, and the massive pit on the sea was gradually refilled by the surging waters. Torrential rain poured down, and only the lingering energy fluctuations testified to the earth-shaking battle that had just taken place.

Yao Changjun was nowhere to be seen, nor was Yang Kai. Only a round bead, about the size of a dragon’s eye, slowly sank into the depths of the vast sea.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai rushed to the medicine garden; his body was pitch-black as ink, strange Demon Marks crawling over his skin.

Liu Yan arrived at the same time. After glancing at Yang Kai’s condition, she was so frightened she immediately fled.

It wasn’t that she didn’t dare stay, but that she couldn’t remain here.

Although Yang Kai could barely maintain a shred of consciousness, who knew how long it would last? Staying would only cause him more trouble.

Beside the medicine garden, Yang Kai forced himself to sit cross-legged, focusing his mind to begin stripping away the gold and silver sealing power from the Firmament Tree.

Last time he was demonized, he used the Firmament Tree’s sealing power to suppress the Demonic Qi. It had been more than two years since then, and logically, the Firmament Tree’s sealing power shouldn’t have grown so quickly.

But beneath the medicine garden lay countless layers of Heavy Earth, and five Earth Vein beads. A year of growth here was equal to a hundred years outside.

In other words, the Firmament Tree now had two hundred years’ worth of sealing power, enough to suppress the Demonic Qi.

Under Yang Kai’s control, the gold and silver powers slowly peeled away from the Firmament Tree, flowing into his body and sinking into his Dantian, suppressing and sealing the rampaging Demonic Qi.

Having experienced this once before, Yang Kai was now quite adept.

As time passed, more and more Demonic Qi was sealed, and Yang Kai gradually escaped the effects of demonization, slowly regaining his senses.

Three days later, as the last trace of sealing power was drawn into his body, the Demonic Qi was finally completely sealed away.

Yang Kai let out a long breath.

He had truly feared something would go wrong during the sealing process. The power gained from unsealing this time was much greater than before. Fortunately, the Firmament Tree’s sealing power had also grown stronger, or the consequences would have been unimaginable.

With the Demonic Qi problem resolved, Yang Kai began to check his injuries.

In the battle with Yao Changjun, it seemed he had the upper hand, even finishing things in a few moves after demonization, but Yao Changjun’s final counterattack still left him with considerable wounds.

After all, his opponent was a Third Stage Emperor Realm. If not for breaking his Sea of Consciousness, killing him wouldn’t have been so easy.

He didn’t know how many bones were broken, and the blood on his skin had dried, forming a bloody shell. What troubled Yang Kai most was that even his meridians were damaged.

Fortunately, the medicine garden had the Everlasting Tree. In terms of healing, even the Twin Lotus couldn’t match the Everlasting Tree’s effects. Besides, Yang Kai’s own recovery ability was extremely strong, so he didn’t need other medicines.

Half a day later, Yang Kai was once again full of vigor. He shook off the crusted blood from his body and changed into a fresh set of clothes.

Thinking back on the fight with Yao Changjun, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel anxious.

This time, he was able to use the Demonic Qi to defeat Yao Changjun, but what about next time? If he unseals it again, two hundred years of sealing power won’t be enough.

It might take three hundred, four hundred years, or even more.

In other words, the Firmament Tree would need to grow in the medicine garden for three or four years to accumulate enough sealing power for Yang Kai to unseal again.

With such a long time, who knew if he’d encounter another powerful enemy?

If only he had Taiyi Divine Water! Taiyi Divine Water was a creation of heaven and earth, able to rapidly mature all kinds of Spiritual Objects without any side effects. A single drop could grant the Firmament Tree hundreds or even thousands of years of sealing power.

Unfortunately, Taiyi Divine Water was far too precious. Yang Kai had only seen it once, in the Time Temple, where it was ultimately obtained by Murong Xiaoxiao.

That was the legacy of the Great Emperor of Time. Who knew if the Star Realm still had any Taiyi Divine Water?

Yang Kai secretly resolved that in the next three or four years, he absolutely must not unseal the Demonic Qi again, unless he found Taiyi Divine Water to mature the Firmament Tree in advance.

With this thought, his mind cleared, and he felt refreshed.

He transplanted the two Butian Lotuses he had obtained into the medicine garden, then clapped his hands and stood up.

Although that pristine Butian Lotus had been picked by Liu Qianyun quite some time ago, it was well preserved, so its medicinal potency remained intact and its foundation undamaged. Now, transplanted into the medicine garden and nourished by the vitality of the Everlasting Tree, it would surely thrive once more.

The Twin Lotus was extremely valuable, but Yang Kai didn’t need it now, so he was in no hurry to refine the Twin Butian Pill.
