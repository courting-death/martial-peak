## Chapter 1469 — Remarkable Words

The moment the words escaped her, Xue Yue's expression twisted wildly; she stared at Yang Kai in a daze and exclaimed in alarm, "You wouldn't really..."

Yang Kai's mouth curled slightly; he snorted coldly and said, "I told you, at worst we'll drag each other down — if you let us leave now it's not too late, otherwise..."

In an instant, Xue Yue’s face turned ashen. She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be this stubborn! Her heart surged with anger and grief, and her delicate body trembled uncontrollably. All she had wanted was for him to come with her—she hadn’t intended to harm him. On the contrary, there were immense fortunes awaiting him. So why was he resisting her to such an extent?

So many people wished to follow her but couldn't gain entry; she was extending an olive branch, trying to win him over, albeit in an overbearing way. Why couldn't he understand her good intentions?

Since birth, apart from facing her father, Chairman Ai Ou, Xue Yue had never been so passive.

Woman or not, even when a woman disguised herself as a man she still could be impulsive. Seeing Yang Kai adopt a 'better to be a shattered jade than an intact tile' stance, her expression calmed and she sneered, "Do as you please. If you insist on this, everyone here except you and I will die!"

At those words, the Origin Returning Realm experts beside Xue Yue changed color and watched Yang Kai tensely.

"Fine, fine!" Yang Kai burst into an angry, incredulous laugh, shrugged his shoulders, stepped forward, and glared viciously at Xue Yue, enunciating each word: "Listen carefully — your Young Master, Xue Yue, has a staggering secret, and I'll tell you what it is right now!"

Now that things had come this far, he had no way out but to spill something explosive.

Xue Yue slowly closed her eyes, drew a deep breath, and did not try to stop him; it looked like she intended to fight Yang Kai to the end.

The Origin Returning Realm experts around her wore odd expressions, all caught between hope and fear. The conversation between Xue Yue and Yang Kai had been open; every word reached their ears clearly.

At this point, they all knew that if Yang Kai truly exposed that secret, they might become implicated. Sometimes even hearing something unrelated could bring trouble, and for a behemoth like the Hengluo Commerce Guild many secrets simply could not be leaked.

Paradoxically, their curiosity only sharpened.

Shan Qingluo and Biluo were no different. Both women pricked up their ears and listened intently.

Just as Yang Kai was about to reveal that so-called staggering secret, the three-whiskered elder beside Xue Yue couldn't help but shout angrily, "Shut up!"

He would not sit idly by and let this happen; he wanted to stop Yang Kai before the secret escaped. With a shout he moved, flying toward Yang Kai like a great roc spreading its wings, full of murderous intent as if he intended to kill Yang Kai in a single blow.

Yang Kai didn't even glance at him. Gritting his teeth, he let the words out: "Your Xue Yue's Third Young Master fancies me — yes, he has fallen deeply in love with me!"

Those words struck like thunder and shattered stone!

Everyone gaped. Shan Qingluo and Biluo covered their mouths with their hands, glancing between Yang Kai and Xue Yue with puzzlement flickering in their beautiful eyes.

The three-whiskered elder, who had lunged at Yang Kai, staggered and fell from the air. His killing move dissipated; upon landing he gaped in bewilderment.

The crowd's eyes nearly fell from their sockets.

This... this news — what a bombshell!

"How dare you!" the beautiful woman beside Xue Yue snapped, "The Third Young Master is a man of such exalted status, surrounded by beauties, how could he... how could he be with you..."

As she scolded, she sneaked a glance at Xue Yue and saw Xue Yue's face blanching and flushing in turns, eyes round with shock. Yet her expression was awkward, as if some secret had been exposed.

Could it... be true? the beautiful woman felt a stab of alarm.

"Surrounded by beauties?" Yang Kai sneered. "Have you ever seen him show special favor to any of those beauties? Have you seen him spend a night with any of them?"

Hearing this, several Origin Returning Realm experts went blank, and upon careful thought realized it was true: although the Third Young Master treated everyone with courtesy and wore a smile that warmed like spring — charming scores of young women — he had never actually been intimate with any of them.

He never lacked women; wherever he went beauties threw themselves at him and offered themselves.

But in truth, he had never shared any intimate contact with a woman—let alone spent a night with one.

In the past they credited the Third Young Master for self-restraint and chastity, but now...

Considering the prior exchange between the Third Young Master and Yang Kai about 'forced fruit being sour' and the fact the Third Young Master would rather take Yang Kai and abandon those temptresses, many were seventy to eighty percent convinced.

Could the Third Young Master really have a peculiar orientation?

When they looked back at the Third Young Master, his face was flushed red — clearly guilty like a thief caught in the act — and the beautiful woman dared not speak, torn between regret and amusement.

How could such a fine man fall for another man?

Most people's expressions were similar; these folks had lived countless years and were skilled at reading faces. Xue Yue's demeanor and stance already spoke volumes.

A breathless, girlish laugh came from Shan Qingluo, who was bent double laughing; her sound made Xue Yue feel more awkward than ever, wishing she could crawl into a hole and hide.

Although she was a woman, she had long presented herself as a man before others. Being publicly called out by Yang Kai was humiliating. She had no strength to retort; her body trembled and her Qi and blood surged.

This move of Yang Kai's truly surprised her; she hadn't imagined he could be so shameless, caring not a whit for his own reputation.

"You're... vicious," Xue Yue ground out, veins bulging on her forehead as she glared at Yang Kai and shouted, "How dare you slander this Young Master!"

"Whether it's slander," Yang Kai chuckled, "Heaven knows, earth knows, and you and I know."

"Fine, fine!" Xue Yue trembled, bared her silver teeth, and waved her hand: "Seize those few, especially that shameless bastard — I want his mouth torn, to make him taste every human torment."

Many Origin Returning Realm experts were taken aback and cursed inwardly.

When the Third Young Master gave orders before, he had never shown such mercy; he would normally demand utter slaughter. But today, he had chosen to have the three captured alive, unwilling to see them harmed.

It seemed the brat had not been making up lies; otherwise, given the Third Young Master's fury, how could he spare them?

Moreover, if it had truly been slander, the Third Young Master, by nature, would not care nor lose his temper.

Six or seven Origin Returning Realm experts of the Third Stage exchanged looks and sensed this matter was thorny. The three-whiskered elder barked, "Excuse us!"

Only then did they swarm toward Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo, unleashing secret treasures and forbidden techniques — though fierce in aura, they harbored no intent to kill, merely to carry out Xue Yue's order and seize them alive.

They had originally thought that, with their numbers and strength, capturing the enemy alive would be an easy task. The only troublesome one, perhaps, would be that enchantress at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

But once combat began, they realized they'd thought too simply.

The enchantress, needless to say, had clearly cultivated some profound and wondrous art. With a mere wave of her hand, she drew upon her Saint Yuan to connect with the world’s Spiritual Qi, conjuring a vast spiderweb that blanketed the sky and shrouded the palace. She moved freely within it, as though walking on level ground, while anyone else who so much as brushed against the web would be instantly ensnared and hindered. They had barely exchanged a few blows before one unfortunate cultivator was wrapped up like a dumpling, utterly unable to break free.

Her strength could be explained by her cultivation level, after all.

But the man named Yang Kai was astonishing: though merely First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, every move packed tremendous killing power. The golden threads he shot had the wondrous power to dispel Shi; the fiery red great bird circling above his head; the stone giant wielding a black staff; the long sword that became a jade-green giant dragon...

He single-handedly confronted three Third Stage Origin Returning Realm experts and did not fall behind.

This man was such a monster! No wonder Xue Yue's Third Young Master would abandon gender distinctions and look upon him differently.

Compared to them, Biluo was the most inconspicuous, having hidden herself behind layers of web at the battle's outset, concealing her breath; no one knew her location. Occasionally an attack leapt from her hiding place, appearing briefly before vanishing again.

Xue Yue stood aside stunned, a bitter smile at her mouth. To be fair, Yang Kai's explosive revelation had angered her, but she was somewhat relieved he hadn't disclosed the greatest secret.

So Xue Yue didn't want to go too far.

From afar she observed and discovered that after ten or more years apart Yang Kai's growth had become terrifyingly immense; she was stirred and even more resolved to bind him to her side.

Such a talent should remain in the Hengluo Commerce Guild and by her side to receive the best cultivation and the broadest prospects, so he could go further.

As for that enchantress... Xue Yue cast a grudging look at Shan Qingluo.

Back then, she had spent some time with Yang Kai and knew there was already another woman in his heart. Thus, she had assumed that the reason he left Rainfall Star was because of Shan Qingluo.

She wanted nothing more than to single combat Shan Qingluo so Yang Kai would know the right choice, but if she truly did that their relationship would only worsen, and she hesitated, heart aching.
