## Chapter 162 — The Rebound of the Dual Cultivation Technique

Taking out the incense burner, Yang Kai lit the peculiar incense and sat cross-legged at the cave entrance, cultivating the True Yang Technique.

Although the best way to obtain Yang Liquid was to directly consume Yang attribute spirit fruits or draw energy from Yang Flame Stones, Yang Kai still chose to cultivate the True Yang Technique.

He intended to utilize the effects of the peculiar incense to suppress the speed of the True Yang Technique's operation, allowing the Yuan Qi within his body to adapt to the incense's suppression.

In this way, when the time for battle came, his Yuan Qi would circulate even faster, enhancing his combat power.

Suppression was for the sake of an explosive release when needed.

Yang Kai cultivated for two full days, only moving to add herbs to the incense burner.

The increase in his Yuan Qi was minimal, and operating the True Yang Technique was extremely difficult, yet Yang Kai still found it enjoyable.

However, whenever he operated the True Yang Technique, he inadvertently thought of Su Yan's appearance. Each time he recalled her, he remembered everything that had happened in the grand hall, recalling her warm, moist skin that was as smooth as exquisite silk.

Strange, why do I keep thinking about this? Yang Kai was puzzled. Could it be that he was truly some kind of lecherous ghost, unable to restrain himself once he broke the seal?

But that shouldn't be the case. In terms of willpower, Yang Kai was quite confident. Unable to understand the reason behind it, he could only try his best to control his wandering thoughts.

One night, two days later, while Yang Kai was meditating, he suddenly opened his eyes, listening intently for a long while, his face revealing a strange expression.

He seemed to have heard the sounds of fighting coming from above, along with a familiar cry.

The voice was somewhat familiar, yet he couldn't quite make it out.

Just as he hesitated, a few small stones suddenly tumbled down in front of him.

Yang Kai's expression turned cold, and he immediately became alert.

These small stones clearly fell because someone was climbing down from above.

His cave abode had only just been established for two days; how could it be discovered? Who was the visitor?

However, as the commotion above grew louder, Yang Kai's vigilance gradually faded, replaced by a sense of wild joy.

For some reason, he could sense that the visitor was Su Yan! The restless Yuan Qi within him and the quickening of his blood told him this.

Perhaps it was due to the Dual Cultivation Technique. The past dual cultivation had allowed their Yuan Qi to merge, and it was this connection that enabled them to sense each other from a short distance away.

Wasn't it said that they would meet once a month? How could she come to find him after just ten days apart? A strange smile appeared on Yang Kai's face.

He conveyed a temporary instruction to Di Mo not to return, and with eager anticipation, he gazed at the cave entrance.

Moments later, a pure white figure floated in from outside.

Before she could land, Yang Kai reached out and pulled her into his embrace.

Su Yan's body was very warm, and he could feel her heart pounding against his chest. Under the hazy moonlight, he could even see a faint blush on her face.

She still wore her hair in a woman's bun, dressed like a mature lady, which made her appear even more alluring.

Yang Kai leaned down to kiss her.

"Wait a moment." Su Yan, feeling the intense heat approaching, suppressed her excitement and gently pushed Yang Kai away.

"What's wrong?" Yang Kai did not insist.

"I'm not alone." Su Yan glanced at Yang Kai with some embarrassment.

Only then did Yang Kai notice that she was holding someone in her arms. The person was slumped over, and it was unclear whether she was unconscious or not, as she had not moved at all. If Su Yan hadn't pointed it out, Yang Kai wouldn't have noticed.

"What’s going on?" Yang Kai was stunned, his mind momentarily blank. Why did Su Yan bring someone with her when she came to find him?

"Do you know her?" Su Yan asked, biting her red lip, her expression a mix of guilt and awkwardness.

"Let me see." Yang Kai reached out to lift the person, cradling her in his arms.

"Be careful, she's a woman!" Su Yan reminded him, half-amused and half-exasperated.

"Ah..." Yang Kai's face flushed. No wonder he felt something soft pressing against his arm; it turned out the person was a woman.

"Don't touch places you shouldn't!" Su Yan shot him a glare.

Yang Kai felt utterly embarrassed, hurriedly turning the unknown woman over. Upon seeing her face, he was struck dumb, as if hit by lightning.

"Little Junior Sister?" After a long pause, Yang Kai finally reacted.

He never expected that the person Su Yan brought was actually Xia Ningshang.

No wonder her back looked somewhat familiar.

At this moment, Xia Ningshang lay with her eyes tightly closed, her face still covered by a veil. Her breathing was steady, indicating she was not injured, merely unconscious.

"What... what is going on?" Yang Kai was utterly confused, his mind a chaotic mess.

To say that Su Yan came to find him in the middle of the night, Yang Kai could still somewhat accept. But for her to bring an unconscious Xia Ningshang along was quite bewildering.

Recalling the sounds of fighting he had heard earlier, Yang Kai was suddenly alarmed, looking at Su Yan and asking, "Did you knock her out?"

Su Yan's expression turned somewhat unnatural as she nodded slightly, saying, "I didn't hurt her. She has been here for the past few days, and I wanted to come find you but couldn't, so I knocked her out..."

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, feeling speechless. Although both Su Yan and Xia Ningshang were in the True Yuan Realm, one was at the Third Stage while the other had just recently advanced. If they really fought, Xia Ningshang would definitely be no match for Su Yan. Moreover, since Su Yan said she knocked her out, it was likely she had attacked unexpectedly.

This situation was troublesome. Xia Ningshang was easy to deal with; she had no temper, and once she woke up, they could explain things and it would be fine. But if Meng Wuya found out about this, with his overbearing protective nature...

Just thinking about it made Yang Kai break out in a cold sweat.

"She seems to care about you a lot. You know her, right?" Su Yan asked, looking at Yang Kai.

"Yeah." Yang Kai did not deny it, carrying Xia Ningshang inside and placing her on the stone bed.

Looking at her sleeping face, Yang Kai finally let out a sigh of relief. Thankfully, she was not hurt. If she had been injured, he truly wouldn't know how to handle it.

Su Yan remained silent, quietly watching.

"You came to find me so late; is there something on your mind?" Yang Kai asked as he sat beside the stone bed, holding her.

Su Yan shifted uncomfortably, biting her lip for a long time before saying, "It's nothing."

"Then you must have missed me?" Yang Kai smiled.

Su Yan gently nodded.

Just as Yang Kai was about to make a move, Su Yan suddenly raised her hand to cover his mouth, her expression serious as she said, "This is unusual! I cultivate the Ice Heart Technique, which allows me to remain unperturbed, so it shouldn't be like this. But now, whenever I cultivate, I start thinking of you, and the more I suppress it, the stronger the feeling becomes!"

"I miss you too!"

Those words instantly made Su Yan's body go soft, and she lost all strength to resist.

"This matter can wait for later." Yang Kai suddenly pushed Su Yan down onto the stone bed, his hands roaming freely.

Breathless sounds began to fill the air, growing heavier, and their clothes gradually became disheveled.

Yang Kai raised his gaze, and under the hazy moonlight, he caught a glimpse of Su Yan's skin, glistening like jade, her alluring curves radiating an enticing glow beneath her thin bodice. Her long legs were partially visible, and a faint fragrance wafted into his nostrils with her gentle breaths.

Her face, her nose, her lips, and her trembling eyes, all were as beautiful as a dream—a dream that would shatter upon waking.

Her expression was tense yet filled with anticipation.

The pure and pristine goddess, who captivated all male disciples of the three sects, lay beneath him, allowing him to savor her, especially with that layer of sacred glow on her face, revealing a unique charm.

Yang Kai, full of youthful vigor, could hardly resist such temptation. A surge of heat rushed through his dantian as he leaned down, kissing every inch of Su Yan's delicate skin.

She trembled, unconsciously twisting her body, gasping softly.

After a long while, Yang Kai finally penetrated gently.

As their bodies filled to the brim, Su Yan experienced a slight discomfort before being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of pleasure.

She cooperated shyly, even as she covered her mouth with her hand, soft sounds still escaping.

In the stone chamber, petals fell like rain, filling the air with a fragrant aroma.

After the storm, the two nestled together, both feeling an indescribable awkwardness.

It wasn't that they felt awkward facing each other, but rather that after their intense battle, they suddenly remembered that Xia Ningshang was lying just half a foot away from them!

Fortunately, she was still unconscious! Yang Kai was immensely relieved, and Su Yan felt a wave of fear wash over her.

They didn't know what had happened, but in the midst of their dual cultivation, they had only thought of each other, completely disregarding Xia Ningshang beside them.

Holding the jade-like figure in his arms, Yang Kai was the first to speak: "Su Yan, I feel this isn't just our issue."

"Yeah." Su Yan gently nodded, her soft hair cascading over Yang Kai's chest, stirring a ticklish sensation with every slight movement.

"It must be due to the Dual Cultivation Technique. Whenever we cultivate, we can't help but think of each other. And judging by your situation, the more you cultivate, the more you will think of me!"

Su Yan lightly punched Yang Kai's chest, reproaching him for being so blunt.

"I haven't cultivated much these past few days, so I don't feel it as deeply as you do." Yang Kai spoke truthfully. He had only been cultivating for two days, and during that time, he was also under the suppression of the peculiar incense, so his situation was much better than Su Yan's.

"It seems we are destined to be tied together." Yang Kai laughed happily.

"We can't let it be this way!" Su Yan said firmly. "If we are together, we won't be able to control our thoughts."

"What do you want to do then?" Yang Kai asked.

"Suppress it. We must do our utmost to suppress it. We cannot become slaves to the Dual Cultivation Technique; we are the ones cultivating it, not the other way around!" Su Yan clearly had made up her mind. After speaking, she looked up at Yang Kai gently: "I know this may be a bit cruel for you. My Ice Heart Technique gives me a significant advantage in suppressing my feelings, while you are different. Your Yuan Qi is extremely strong and Yang in nature; once it surges, it will be much more intense than mine."
