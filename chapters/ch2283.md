## Chapter 2283 — Linghu Palace

The swirling cloud of Soul-Devouring Worms suddenly surged toward him, their buzzing filling the air. Yang Kai stood solemnly in place, fully alert and ready to act at any moment.

In no time, he was enveloped by the swarm. One Soul-Devouring Worm landed on him, shook its wings, and settled quietly, crawling motionlessly. Then another followed...

Large swathes of the insect cloud descended, wrapping him layer upon layer and completely obscuring his figure.

Yet all the Soul-Devouring Worms remained calm, showing no intention of attacking Yang Kai. Instead, under an invisible connection, they obeyed his every command.

“Hahahaha!” Yang Kai couldn’t help but burst out laughing, feeling that the Slave-Insect Bracelet was truly a marvelous treasure.

Back in the Divine Roaming Mirror world, Yang Kai had already sensed that his batch of Soul-Devouring Worms was becoming difficult to control. Later, the other batch he obtained from Tian Yan had no mental connection with him at all.

But now, these evolved Soul-Devouring Worms obediently followed his orders, responding as if they were his own limbs. The greatest credit, of course, belonged to the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

This Imperial Treasure had no offensive or defensive power, but it could subdue all rare and exotic insects under heaven. It was the life’s work of the Insect Emperor, and it truly proved effective against the Soul-Devouring Worms.

With this, Yang Kai no longer had any worries. In the future, when facing powerful enemies, the Soul-Devouring Worms could become another means of attack for him.

After testing them out, Yang Kai was very satisfied. With a thought, he commanded the Soul-Devouring Worms to return to the large jar to rest and recuperate.

The internal space of the Slave-Insect Bracelet seemed to subtly promote the survival of rare and exotic insects. Not only would they not die or weaken inside, but they would actually grow stronger over time.

Of course, if he wanted the Soul-Devouring Worms to grow faster, Yang Kai would still need to find more Formless Profound Grass to feed them.

Formless Profound Grass wasn’t considered a particularly rare Spiritual Herb. Many major sects could cultivate it themselves, so it wasn’t hard to find. The only issue was that Yang Kai needed a huge quantity, which would be a considerable expense.

In the past, Yang Kai might not have been able to afford it, but now he had acquired a Source Crystal mine. For the time being, he didn’t need to worry about Source Crystals at all and could purchase as much as he wanted.

With this in mind, Yang Kai withdrew his consciousness from the Slave-Insect Bracelet, opened his eyes, stood up, and left the secret room to buy some Formless Profound Grass in the city.

As soon as he stepped out, Yang Kai immediately sensed the difference in the surrounding Spiritual Qi. It seemed that during his closed-door cultivation, the density of Spiritual Qi in Fenglin City had increased noticeably.

This surprised him greatly. After all, Lou Chi had used the Imperial Treasure Two Forms Record to seal the Spirit Lake, so logically, the Spiritual Qi in Fenglin City should have gradually thinned over time and returned to its previous state.

Yet after all these days, not only had the Spiritual Qi not decreased, it actually seemed to have increased, leaving Yang Kai completely puzzled.

Just then, a graceful figure shot over from not far away and appeared before him—it was Ye Qinghan.

“Young Master Yang, you’ve come out of seclusion!” Ye Qinghan looked Yang Kai up and down, noticing his calm aura and restrained brilliance. She couldn’t help but envy him, saying, “It seems you’ve gained quite a lot this time.”

“So-so.” Yang Kai grinned. Since he had decided to accompany Ye Qinghan to Chiyue Sect, he no longer felt so guarded around her. With a slight change in expression, he asked in surprise, “You haven’t been waiting here the whole time, have you?”

Ye Qinghan gave an embarrassed smile. “I didn’t have anything else to do anyway.”

Yang Kai said, “Don’t worry. Since I’ve already promised you, I won’t run away. I’ll definitely go with you to Chiyue Sect.”

“I didn’t mean to watch over you, Young Master Yang...” Ye Qinghan hurriedly waved her hands, flustered. “I just... just...”

She stammered for a while but couldn’t come up with a reason, growing more and more panicked, afraid of angering Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Forget it. Come with me to buy a few things. Once we’re done, we’ll set out.”

Ye Qinghan’s face lit up and she quickly nodded. “Alright, alright...”

With that, the two of them headed into the city.

As they made their way through the city, Yang Kai noticed that Fenglin City was far less bustling than before—martial artists were scattered sparsely along the streets, a stark contrast to the usual lively crowds. Yet, every face he passed was beaming with joy, as if everyone had stumbled upon some great fortune. Puzzled, he remarked, “Why is everyone grinning like they’ve just struck it rich? Did something good happen in the city?”

Ye Qinghan covered her mouth and smiled. “Fenglin City is different now. The Spiritual Qi is three to five times denser than before, so of course everyone is happy.”

“Right, I was just about to ask you about that.” Yang Kai turned to her. “What’s going on with the Spiritual Qi? Why has it become so much richer?”

Ye Qinghan explained, “You’ve been in seclusion for a month, so you don’t know about the changes in Fenglin City. Here’s what happened... About a month ago, several lords led by Lord Xiao of Star God Palace discussed for several days and decided to transform the Spirit Lake area into a Sacred Land for cultivation. They summoned people from their respective sects, and ten days ago, the renovations were completed. Now, the place where the Spirit Lake was has become a cultivation site famous throughout the entire Southern Territory, attracting countless martial artists. That’s why the city is so empty—everyone’s gone to see the excitement.”

After hearing her explanation, Yang Kai finally understood why Fenglin City had suddenly become so deserted. It turned out everyone had gone to see the Spirit Lake.

“That place was named Linghu Palace by Lord Xiao Yuyang and the other lords. It covers a vast area and has many secret rooms built inside for martial artists to use for closed-door cultivation.”

“Linghu Palace!” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Ye Qinghan smiled. “Exactly.”

Yang Kai mused, “So who manages Linghu Palace? Who does it belong to?”

Ye Qinghan replied, “None of the major sects wanted to monopolize it. Linghu Palace is managed jointly by Star God Palace, the major sects, and Fenglin City, and it’s open to the entire Southern Territory. As long as you have enough Source Crystals, you can enter and cultivate.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai was surprised. “Fenglin City gets to help manage it too?”

“Of course. Linghu Palace is right next to Fenglin City, so it’s best for the city to help manage it. Now, Fenglin City has truly made a name for itself.”

Yang Kai chuckled. “I can just imagine how delighted City Lord Duan must be.”

Ye Qinghan covered her mouth and laughed. “Indeed, although City Lord Duan’s cultivation is still at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, with Linghu Palace, his status has risen dramatically. He’s probably now on par with the sect masters of the top sects.”

“High status but insufficient strength makes it hard to command respect!” Yang Kai frowned, feeling a bit worried for Duan Yuanshan.

Ye Qinghan glanced at him and said, “You don’t need to worry about that, Young Master Yang. Lord Xiao has already made City Lord Duan and Vice City Lord Drunken Old Man outer disciples of Star God Palace. They’ve also been given honorary positions in top forces like Qingyang Shrine and Tianwu Sacred Land.”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded. “Is that even possible?”

Ye Qinghan covered her lips and giggled. “It was probably done out of necessity.”

“Those lords are truly farsighted.” Yang Kai shook his head with a wry smile. “I’ve never heard of such a thing, but with this arrangement, no one will dare look down on City Lord Duan or Drunken Old Man, nor disobey their authority.”

Now, even though Duan Yuanshan and Drunken Old Man’s cultivation wasn’t that high, with the backing of the top sects of the entire Southern Territory, managing Fenglin City and Linghu Palace would be no problem at all.

Anyone who dared disobey would be making enemies of all the top forces in the Southern Territory. Who would be so reckless?

“Still, Lord Xiao is truly impressive. Star God Palace is worthy of being the overlord of the Southern Territory—their magnanimity is extraordinary.” Yang Kai said sincerely.

To be honest, if Star God Palace really wanted to monopolize Linghu Palace, no one would dare resist. After all, with Radiant Moon Great Emperor overseeing Star God Palace, the other top forces couldn’t possibly compete.

But Star God Palace didn’t do that. Instead, they took the lead in uniting the various forces and made Linghu Palace a Sacred Land open to the entire Southern Territory. This showed the overlord sect’s generosity and breadth of mind.

Not every sect could do such a thing.

Even Wen Zishan of Qingyang Shrine, if he got his hands on such a Sacred Land, Yang Kai figured he’d secretly keep it for his own disciples.

People always favor those close to them. That’s only natural—no one would go out of their way to consider others for no reason.

“Go on,” Yang Kai prompted.

“Linghu Palace follows Star God Palace’s system for dividing Sacred Lands into three grades: Heaven, Earth, and Human. The Human-Grade Sacred Land is open to martial artists below the Origin Returning Realm, while the Earth-Grade is for those at the Dao Origin Realm and below. As for the top Heaven-Grade, it’s only open to Emperor Realm experts.” At this, a look of longing appeared on Ye Qinghan’s face, as if she were yearning for the supreme Emperor Realm. “The higher the grade, the more Source Crystals it costs to enter and cultivate. For the top Heaven-Grade area, it’s said that one day and night costs one thousand Upper-Level Source Crystals, and only Upper-Level Source Crystals are accepted—no substitutions with Middle-Level or Lower-Level are allowed.”

“That price... is truly terrifying!” Yang Kai exclaimed in awe.

One thousand Upper-Level Source Crystals is equal to ten thousand Middle-Level, or ten million Lower-Level Source Crystals.

And that’s just for a single day and night. But martial artists often go into seclusion for ten days or half a month at a time. If they want to comprehend secret arts or techniques, it’s common to spend half a year or more. Especially for Emperor Realm experts, a single retreat could last years or even decades.

The amount of Source Crystals required would be incalculable.

And they’re only allowed to pay with Upper-Level Source Crystals—the requirements are extremely strict.

“But most Emperor Realm experts are wealthy. If they truly want to advance further on the Martial Dao, they probably don’t care about such worldly possessions.” Yang Kai mused.
