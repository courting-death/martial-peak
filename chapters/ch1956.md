## Chapter 1956 — Sword Intent Comes Alive

Atop the Ice Cliff, with the snow‑white radiance fading, the ten‑thousand‑year stillness settled back in. Yang Kai’s face was ashen as he drew ragged breaths; he stepped forward, picked up the Slave‑Insect Bracelet he had earlier thrown away, and wore the dazed, relieved expression of someone who had just escaped annihilation.

That he had escaped this time, and even caused the Yao Worm Matriarch to be fatally harmed by its own secret art, was all thanks to the power of that Slave-Insect Bracelet.

An Imperial Treasure — the Slave-Insect Bracelet!

The Slave-Insect Bracelet was the Insect Emperor’s life-bound Secret Treasure, and it possessed an innate suppression over the wondrous and strange insects of the world.

The Insect Emperor had fallen from his throne and been slain by Yang Kai on Dark Star; his two Imperial Treasures had become Yang Kai’s spoils. Besides this bracelet that symbolized his identity, there was also the Soul-Severing Blade.

However, both Imperial Treasures were far too high in grade and did not match the nature of Yang Kai’s inner power, so he could not refine them.

Both treasures remained preserved in the Black Book Space; Yang Kai had never used the Soul-Severing Blade, while the Slave-Insect Bracelet had now been used a second time.

The first time had been in the Lost Realm, when Yang Kai and Xue Yue were pursued by countless Illusory Void Butterflies; at that time Yang Kai had used the Bracelet’s miraculous effect to drive off the innumerable Illusory Void Butterflies that even Void King Realm experts feared.

That experience had shown Yang Kai that the Slave-Insect Bracelet could perform wondrous feats under certain conditions.

Just now a flash of insight had reminded him that he still had this unusual Secret Treasure; he pulled it out to try it and found the effect unexpectedly excellent.

Staring at the Slave-Insect Bracelet, Yang Kai felt puzzled, because even though the bracelet had belonged to the Insect Emperor and had a born ability to counter wondrous insects, the Yao Worm Matriarch’s strength was not trivial—how could it have been suppressed and then turned on itself to die under the bracelet’s pressure?

He could not make sense of it.

After a moment, he put away the Slave-Insect Bracelet, his figure flashed, and he vanished from the spot, entering the Small Xuan Realm within the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Sending out his Divine Sense to probe briefly, Yang Kai immediately understood where the snow-white light that had emerged from the Yao Worm Matriarch now resided.

He moved again; in an instant he had arrived at another place in the Small Xuan Realm.

Here the mountains were clear and the waters fair, a tranquil scene; only a single snow-white radiance was darting swiftly through the air, taking the shape of a long sword and flying like a headless moth.

Yang Kai hid in the shadows and did not reveal himself at once, instead silently observing it.

Now that this thing had been taken into the Xuan Realm Pearl it had, in effect, entered Yang Kai’s territory. Even if it truly possessed Emperor-level strength, Yang Kai felt no fear.

The more he looked, the more Yang Kai felt its form resembled Su Yan’s Profound Frost Divine Sword, which only further corroborated his previous conjectures about the Ice Heart Valley founder Bing Yun.

“Is this the Yao Worm Matriarch’s soul?” Yang Kai wondered inwardly, but he soon realized it was wrong: this sword-shaped snow-white radiance did resemble a soul, an energy-formed structure with a hint of chaotic awareness, but it was not the Yao Worm Matriarch’s soul; rather, Yang Kai sensed in it a chilling sword intent.

What on earth was this thing?

After watching for some time, Yang Kai confirmed that once separated from the Yao Worm Matriarch’s body this thing could not threaten his current self, so he came out with composure.

No sooner had Yang Kai appeared before it than the sword-shaped snow-white radiance gave a clear ring; a surge of icy profound intent and Power of the Laws instantly enwrapped the sword, its tip trembling and pointing in the[[ ]]direction of Yang Kai.

"Don't overestimate yourself!" Yang Kai slowly shook his head, reached out and lightly swept his hand forward, and the energies of heaven and earth abruptly shifted. The icy profound intent and the coalescing Power of the Laws that had wrapped the blade—growing ever more fierce—collapsed and burst like bubbles.

Within this Xuan Realm Pearl’s world, just as when Yang Kai stood upon Dark Star, he was the sovereign—by a single thought he could change anything he wished.

To attempt to fight him here would be sheer folly.

The snow-white radiance obviously did not realize this; when Yang Kai dispersed its condensed killing move, it did not give up but continued to attempt the Snow Like Clear Sky sword technique.

"Give it a rest!" Yang Kai curled his lip, reached out and pointed; visible energy condensed into rope-like cords that wound around the radiance, binding it so tightly there was no gap.

With another gesture, the bound snow-white radiance flew into his hand.

Yang Kai closed his eyes and began to examine it carefully.

He greatly wanted to know exactly what this thing was.

As time passed, Yang Kai’s impassive expression gradually changed—astonishment, wonder, shock, disbelief—an array of emotions.

After a long while he opened his eyes, staring at the struggling snow-white radiance in his palm as if a ghost had appeared in broad daylight.

“Sword intent come alive? Can such a thing exist?” Yang Kai’s face was filled with horror.

That snow-white sword-shaped radiance was not the Yao Worm Matriarch’s soul nor any living being’s spirit; it was the sentience born of the Sword Intent within the Snow Like Clear Sky technique.

In this world, one need not be flesh and blood to be called a living being or to possess sentience.

Some trees, strange rocks, even Spiritual Pills, after years and years of absorbing enough Spiritual Qi, might develop their own consciousness—heaven-and-earth spiritual objects and pill-spirits among them.

In this vast world there is nothing that cannot occur.

Yet Yang Kai had never expected that the sword intent hidden in a secret technique could itself become sentient and form a chaotic will.

This snow‑white, sword‑shaped radiance was none other than the sword intent contained within the Snow Like Clear Sky secret art — born after countless years of accumulation beneath the Ice Cliff, nurtured by its ice‑cold profound intent and the influence of the Power of the Laws.

Put simply, it was a sword intent.

How profound must the understanding of the Sword Dao have been in the expert who once executed that move? For a mere sword intent to produce such strange effects after ten thousand years was extraordinary.

But that, in turn, explained why it couldn’t manifest the true cultivation of an Emperor‑level master.

The Yao Worm Matriarch’s body had long been dead, likely slain by that Emperor-level expert when the move was first used; because of the special environment and the body’s immense strength, the corpse remained intact, and when the sword intent became sentient it instinctively attached to the Yao Worm Matriarch’s corpse.

This wasn't a true possession of the body, only the most rudimentary control over the Yao Worm Matriarch's corpse, so it naturally couldn't display the Matriarch's full strength.

No wonder it only knew the Snow Like Clear Sky strike and all its killing moves derived from that one technique—now the reason was clear.

It had been produced by the Snow Like Clear Sky sword intent; apart from that technique it knew nothing.

And because it had not fully merged with the Yao Worm Matriarch’s body, when the Slave-Insect Bracelet suppressed it, the sword intent was expelled from the corpse; without a vessel, the technique it unleashed naturally rebounded upon itself.

All the earlier inexplicable things now found reasonable explanation once Yang Kai understood the truth of that snow-white sword radiance.

Looking at the struggling sword intent in his hand, Yang Kai frowned.

There was no denying this was an extraordinarily valuable thing.

After all, a sentient sword intent, if refined and devoured, would amount to directly comprehending all that the Emperor-level expert had felt about that technique, granting one the ability to wield such a devastating move.

Even Yang Kai felt tempted.

Although he already mastered many techniques, gaining one more would present him with greater options in battle.

But to perform such a technique one must have trained in ice-based methods or possess ice-element power within; Yang Kai’s current power lacked any ice aspect, so even if he refined this sword intent, he could not bring Snow Like Clear Sky to its proper effect.

How he wished Su Yan were here! Yang Kai lamented inwardly.

He could not refine it himself, but he could not leave it in the Small Xuan Realm either—there was a medicine field there with spirit herbs he had accumulated over the years; if this thing ran amok among the herbs and caused havoc, Yang Kai would be ruined.

This was a troublesome dilemma.

Yang Kai frowned, unable to refine it, unwilling to leave it behind, and reluctant to discard it; he scratched at his head, at a loss for a good solution.

Just as he felt troubled, an idea suddenly popped into his mind.

Yang Kai’s face brightened and he began to weigh the pros and cons carefully.

After a moment he made up his mind, convinced this was a good plan that would preserve the sentient sword intent and allow his power to increase markedly in a short time.

With that thought he did not hesitate and flashed out of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Looking around, Yang Kai quickly found the Yao Worm Matriarch’s body, riddled and shredded from the Snow Like Clear Sky technique’s rebound; he threw the corpse into the Xuan Realm Pearl and returned to the Small Xuan Realm himself.

Standing on a stretch of open ground, the bound sword intent hovered in midair while the giant snow-white Yao Worm Matriarch’s body lay on the ground; Yang Kai grinned, beckoned, and the sword intent returned to his hand.

Although the sword intent was sentient, its will was chaotic and it could not truly communicate—only pure killing and destruction—so Yang Kai did not bother speaking and instead mobilized his Divine Sense to envelop it.

Yang Kai intended to imprint his soul upon the sword intent.

That way he could command the sentient sword intent and make it obey his orders.

This was no different from controlling a martial cultivator—imprinting a mark on their soul—except that because the other consciousness was chaotic it would not cooperate, but that very chaos made Yang Kai’s method easier.

His Divine Sense surged as Yang Kai drove his will into the sentient sword intent, striving to brand the mark of his life and soul within it.

During the process he met much resistance and even his Divine Sense suffered considerable damage, but one side struggled without purpose while the other acted with intent; in the end, the sentient sword intent could not withstand Yang Kai’s methods and was successfully suppressed and branded with the imprint of his life and soul.
