## Chapter 1600 — Put Your Mind at Ease

The greater the expectation, the deeper the disappointment.

In this moment, Tianze finally understood what Qian Tong meant earlier by saying that one cannot judge a person by appearance — this was exactly what he’d been referring to!

What can someone at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm do? Even if he could fight beyond his rank, he certainly couldn’t change the present situation. His arrival would not greatly affect the overall outcome! At best, he was merely an extra hand.

Tianze’s mood instantly sank into dejection.

Still, he was after all the lord of a city and had a good relationship with Qian Tong and Lin Yurao; he couldn’t show it too openly. A smile appeared on his face as he cupped his fist in greeting: “This Zhao pays respects to Sect Master Yang. Sect Master Yang… hm, indeed a promising young man.”

That compliment was not wholehearted; anyone could hear it.

Yang Kai returned the politeness and clearly had no intention of taking offense. Qian Tong and Lin Yurao exchanged a glance and didn’t bother to explain much.

It was enough that they understood Yang Kai’s strength—one Yang Kai alone could at the very least match several experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm! His presence immediately made them bold enough to remain.

“Hey, a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm has actually shown up here!”

“He survived in the Blood Prison for so long? Lucky fellow.”

“His luck will run out. I bet he won’t survive today.”

“Truly reckless—he actually came near Domain Stone Mountain!”

“This brat is stupid to the extreme. His arrival not only fails to help his companions, it exposes their team’s weakness. Watch, they’re finished.”

Whispering voices rose around them as countless martial artists fixed their gaze on Yang Kai, inspecting him with amused expressions as if he were a curiosity.

Surrounding Domain Stone Mountain were over a hundred experts of the Origin Returning Realm, uniformly at the Third Stage.

Yang Kai alone was a Second Stage amid them, immediately standing out like a crane among chickens. Naturally, he attracted attention and discussion.

Yang Kai remained calm, utterly indifferent to the clamor; it was Tianze whose expression grew increasingly uneasy.

Originally, with him, Qian Tong and Lin Yurao present, even if some eyed them covetously, they could rely on their own presence to steady the situation. But with Yang Kai’s arrival, their position instantly became the focus of all eyes. Divine senses swept here and a torrent of oppressive auras descended; he grew alarmed.

The arrival of this youth called Yang Kai seemed to make their circumstances even more difficult.

He glanced around, sweat beginning to bead on his brow.

“Yang Kai. Those two over there seem odd; they keep watching us.” Qian Tong drew close to Yang Kai and spoke quietly, motioning toward the side as he spoke.

Following his line of sight, Yang Kai saw two martial artists at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm not far off, repeatedly scanning this direction. When Yang Kai looked at them, one of them stared back without reluctance and sneered coldly.

The other held a Transmission Compass in his hand and was continuously communicating with someone.

“I see.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, a trace of puzzlement flashing across his face.

He vaguely felt the clothing the two wore looked familiar, as if he had seen them somewhere before.

But he had always lived on Dark Star and seldom interacted with martial artists from other Cultivation Stars; if he had met them, he could not recall when.

Could it have been in the Imperial Garden? Yang Kai thought. Only during the days the Imperial Garden opened had he frequently dealt with martial artists from other Cultivation Stars.

“By the way, what place is this? What is that huge Domain Stone, and why has it gathered so many people?” Yang Kai withdrew his gaze and asked in puzzlement.

He had come in haste because of Qian Tong’s summons; as for Domain Stone Mountain, he knew nothing about it.

“This is Domain Stone Mountain.” Qian Tong answered. “We only recently learned that the Blood Prison contains such things. For specifics, ask Brother Zhao—he knows more.”

“Then I’ll trouble City Lord Zhao.” Yang Kai cupped his fist at Tianze.

“Sect Master Yang, you flatter me.” Tianze forced a laugh. Though still nervous, he had no problem explaining Domain Stone Mountain’s wonders to Yang Kai and proceeded to recount everything in full detail.

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai’s interest was immediately piqued.

“So the appearance rate of Domain Stone Mountain is very low?”

“Naturally. Perhaps only once in ten Blood Prison Trials does Domain Stone Mountain appear. Beyond that, it is usually shrouded by a terrifying Domain Field, and no one can approach it.” Tianze nodded.

“Has no one thought to take it away?” Yang Kai’s eyes burned as he fixed his gaze on the massive Domain Stone.

If such a huge Domain Stone could be taken, even Void King Realm cultivators would covet it. Placed in any Sect, it would become an Ancestral Treasure and would give rise to many Void King Realm cultivators!

The gentle Domain Field aura it emitted would allow one to contemplate in safety.

“Sect Master Yang, you jest.” Tianze’s mouth twitched. “Not to mention that the Domain Stone is surprisingly heavy—nobody could move it. Even if someone could, none would dare to touch it recklessly.”

“Why is that?” Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

“What if it awakens the latent, powerful Domain Field? Who could withstand that?” Tianze’s expression turned solemn as he gazed oddly at Yang Kai.

He wanted to say Yang Kai was recklessly ignorant, but felt awkward to do so aloud.

“I see!” Yang Kai nodded lightly, finally understanding Domain Stone Mountain’s peculiarity. He stared at it seriously for a moment, then grinned: “Still, this truly is a heaven-sent opportunity! Since we’re here and occupying a good spot, we shouldn’t waste time—let’s begin comprehension. Many already seem to be doing so.”

“Eh, with just the few of us?” Tianze was taken aback.

“Who else is there to wait for?”

“It’s not that there’s anyone to wait for, but with only a few of us we’re a bit weak. If someone ambushed us during comprehension, the consequences would be unthinkable…” Tianze fretted, pointing at the largest group, “Sect Master Yang, look over there; they have many people, so they can spare two to guard while the rest focus on comprehension. We only have four…”

“I’ll guard you. The three of you focus on comprehension.” Yang Kai said magnanimously.

Tianze was stunned but also showed gratitude. Although disappointed by Yang Kai’s earlier arrival, Yang Kai’s offer moved him.

Putting aside his strength, this young man’s character was admirable.

“Sect Master, if you permit, I will act as guardian.” Lin Yurao volunteered.

“No need—just comprehend. Don’t waste time.” Yang Kai waved his hand and urged, “The sooner you comprehend, the greater the gains!”

“Very well.” Qian Tong thought for a moment, then nodded, “Yang Kai, please take care. We won’t immerse ourselves totally; if anything happens, we’ll react immediately. I’ll switch with you after a while.”

“Mm.”

Qian Tong and Lin Yurao exchanged glances and sat cross-legged.

Tianze hesitated, then leaned toward Qian Tong and asked softly, “Elder Qian, is this really safe?”

He didn’t trust leaving his safety to Yang Kai; he would feel better if Qian Tong or Lin Yurao stood guard instead.

“When it comes to Yang Kai, you can set your mind completely at ease,” Qian Tong said, patting him on the shoulder with a tone full of earnest reassurance.

Tianze forced a wry smile. He didn’t know why Qian Tong had so much confidence in Yang Kai, but seeing Qian Tong and Lin Yurao close their eyes and begin comprehension, he couldn’t resist Domain Stone Mountain’s lure and, gritting his teeth, sat cross-legged.

Yet he dared not immerse his mind too deeply, lest he fail to react in time.

Seeing the three enter a meditative state, Yang Kai also sat cross-legged, inspecting Domain Stone Mountain with keen interest.

Before this, he could not imagine the Blood Prison containing such a huge Domain Stone. He had ventured through dozens of Domain vortices and only obtained three Domain Stones in total, all fist-sized; one of them had even been given to Xue Sun.

If he could get such a large Domain Stone…

Yang Kai’s heart quickened; his eyes turned and he chuckled lowly.

Just as he was making plans, Yang Kai’s expression changed and he turned his head to look aside.

Not far off, a party of four hurried over and soon arrived before Domain Stone Mountain. They stopped, all staring at Domain Stone Mountain with blazing eyes and rapid breaths, each showing joy and excitement.

The appearance of Domain Stone Mountain was opportunity for anyone!

“Finally you’re here!” someone greeted, complaining.

Yang Kai looked closely; the man who had sneered at him earlier was among them. He and another companion had been contacting people and keeping an eye on Qian Tong and the others.

It seemed the companions they’d contacted had arrived.

“We ran into some trouble on the way—encountered a yao woman!” the leader answered in a low voice.

“A yao woman?” The questioner’s face showed astonishment.

“Yes. We don’t know where she came from. Her strength was absurd; if we hadn’t been four, we likely couldn’t have repelled her. Fortunately, we had numbers and injured her, but regrettably she escaped.” the leader said angrily.

“That yao woman was truly beautiful. Brother Cai, you missed seeing her; if you’d seen her, you might have been unable to walk.” someone teased.

“Are you exaggerating?” the Cai man scoffed, clearly skeptical.

“I’m not. She was the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, but her aura was strange—part yao, part human Saint Yuan mixed together; it was hard to tell.”

“Enough, don’t mention that yao woman.” The leader waved his hand to cut off the chatter. “Brother Cai, how’s the situation here?”

“Just so.” Cai shrugged. “As you can see, this area around Domain Stone Mountain is only so large; the innermost ring has been occupied by those who arrived earlier, but further out there are still vast spaces.”
