## Chapter 839 — Battle Against the Saint Realm

Thirty li from Dragon-Phoenix Palace, a true dragon manifested, and both sides of the fierce fight were stunned.

Sun Yu, who was wearing an expression of worship, suddenly heard Yang Kai's reminder in his mind. He hastily narrowed his focus, composed his features, and shouted at Yan Zhi in a stern voice, “This place will be your grave today — give me your life!”

The dragon's roar sounded again as the dozens-of-zhang-long golden dragon lashed its head and tail, transforming into a streak of golden light that dove straight at Yan Zhi.

Yan Zhi dared not be negligent; a long sword appeared in his hand — his saint-grade, Lower-Level secret treasure, the Xuanbing Sword!

The moment this treasure was drawn, Yan Zhi's entire bearing rose several notches. An ice-cold chill wafted from him to the bone; the Xuanbing Sword exuded waves of freezing aura, and the blade itself seemed to conceal some hidden secret, poised to strike.

Before the great dragon could reach him, Yan Zhi gently swirled the Xuanbing Sword; in an instant this saint-grade longsword multiplied into myriad forms, each flash of sword-light dazzling the eyes.

Sheets of frigid air emanated from Yan Zhi's body like the north wind off an eternal glacier, and within a radius of a hundred zhang the temperature plunged.

The Saint-Grade, Lower-Level longsword surged forward with overwhelming force to strike the great dragon.

The massive golden dragon did not dodge or swerve; it bore down straight on.

Hiss, hiss, hiss……

Sparks flew as if countless attacks cut against the dragon’s golden scales, scattering bright sparks and a wave of scorching heat. The Xuanbing Sword’s might, like a moon on water or a flower in a mirror, suddenly felt unreal and then was evaporated cleanly away.

Yan Zhi's eyes narrowed and a sense of panic rose in his heart.

Their Youhan Grotto-Heaven specialized in ice-based techniques and martial arts. To meet a true dragon harboring such blazing energy was like a mouse meeting a cat — their greatest nemesis.

The power contained within the Xuanbing Sword could not even unleash eighty percent of its usual potency.

Even Yan Zhi's exquisite techniques dared not be used recklessly; under the scorching aura's influence, the surging of his internal strength no longer felt as smooth.

The true dragon was right before him, its terrible maw gaping. Yan Zhi gave a strangled cry, swung his long sword and sent out rings of radiance. Like a flung ice chain, they swept toward the golden dragon.

This move was merely a desperate attempt to buy himself time to flee. Facing a yao emperor who might have reached the Ninth Stage, Yan Zhi knew he was outmatched; the other's majesty was overwhelming, and lingering further could mean death.

In its presence Yan Zhi felt as if he were walking a tightrope, life hanging by a thread.

Unexpectedly, after those rings of radiance passed over, they actually blocked the golden dragon's assault, leaving it suspended in midair for a while, unable to break free.

Yan Zhi frowned; a vague sense told him something was off.

If that golden dragon were truly Ninth Stage, there was no way it could have been stopped like that.

Upon closer inspection, Yan Zhi found that although the golden dragon's majesty was unquestionable, it did not seem utterly invincible.

The fluctuations of power surging from its body were basically on par with his own, perhaps even slightly inferior.

His eyes flicking, Yan Zhi no longer hurried to flee. He unleashed every refined technique he had and engaged the golden dragon in aerial combat.

Seeing the Dragon Emperor's might so formidable, Chen Zhou — who had been utterly outmatched — was invigorated. He turned the tide against Bai Jingchu in their duel.

The cultivators of Dragon-Phoenix Palace were likewise uplifted. Their previously dim eyes shone again as if they had glimpsed a bright future for their sect; they shifted from defense to offense, forcing Youhan Grotto-Heaven’s invaders back with mounting casualties.

Sun Yu, guarded by that streak of milky way-like protection, widened his eyes and fixed his gaze on the aerial battle; his fists clenched as he silently cheered on the golden dragon.

He also wondered why Senior Yang had not appeared yet — it seemed Yang Kai only used the Dragon Emperor heritage to fight; with his skills, if he had shown himself here he would surely have made Yan Zhi and the others suffer greatly.

Sun Yu's horizons were limited; he had no idea that in terms of rank and cultivation, Yang Kai was only a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm warrior — and one who had only recently advanced to that stage!

After some fierce fighting, Yan Zhi suddenly burst into loud laughter: “So this great beast is just that? Hahahaha!”

When the golden dragon first appeared Yan Zhi had indeed been frightened — after all, he had faced what looked like the legendary Ninth-Stage yao emperor. But now that they had fought, he had finally gauged the dragon's true strength: it was on par with him, just a bit tougher; his various techniques struck it without harming it, all repelled by those golden scales.

He judged that the golden dragon had not yet fully matured; at present it was only at an early Eighth-Stage level! Yan Zhi's panic waned and he became noticeably calmer.

Wisps of chilling aura radiated from the Xuanbing Sword and collided with the dragon’s internal blaze, dissipating each other and bursting into billows of mist. The sky filled with white fog; from a distance one could only see flickers of light and eruptions of energy, unable to make out what occurred within.

Inside that mist, Yan Zhi and the golden dragon clashed at close quarters. From the dragon’s two huge eyes he glimpsed traces of human-like emotion, and his brow tightened.

He had the growing impression that his opponent was not a demonic beast, but a person!

Its adaptability was astonishingly quick, and as the battle progressed Yan Zhi felt increasing pressure as if the golden dragon were rapidly growing stronger in the fight.

The razor-sharp dragon claw struck with the power to tear space itself; Yan Zhi broke out in cold sweat at every attack.

His expression hardened. Yan Zhi steadied his spirit and the Xuanbing Sword at once emitted a pale light. Around him, countless razor-sharp ice prisms sprang into being, covering the heavens as they shot toward the golden dragon.

Faced with that relentless, all-encompassing assault, the golden dragon opened its maw and a surge of golden energy burst forth like a volcanic eruption.

Boom……

The two fierce energies collided — each embodying a wholly opposite martial intent — and in the crash they unleashed dazzling radiance like fireworks, breathtaking to behold.

The blazing energy was undoubtedly purer and more condensed; every ice prism that touched it melted in an instant, yet the momentum remained and smashed toward Yan Zhi.

Yan Zhi panicked and tried to dodge, when a mocking voice suddenly sounded in his mind. The voice made his movement falter and his gaze trembled toward the golden dragon nearby.

By the time he tried to evade again, it was already too late.

A sheet of gold-hot energy capable of burning everything instantly encompassed him. Yan Zhi screamed as cold energy erupted from within him to offset the scorching damage.

After a moment he flew aside, gasping; though not mortally wounded, his beard and hair were all singed and he looked a pitiable sight.

His eyes burned with hatred as he stared at the golden dragon.

The voice that had disturbed his mind had come from the dragon itself, catching him off guard.

What bothered him was that the voice sounded like a person's, not like a demonic beast's.

“I don't care if you're a Dragon Emperor; dare harm me and you'll surely die today!” Yan Zhi roared in maddened fury and hurled the Xuanbing Sword.

In midair the longsword suddenly transformed into a bizarrely-shaped demonic beast of enormous size, matching the golden dragon. It leapt with bared fangs and claws, radiating a biting chill as it bound the golden dragon tight.

The dragon's roar rang out as the dozens-of-zhang-long golden dragon leapt, but it still could not break the bondage created by the Xuanbing Sword's beast form.

Riding the momentum, Yan Zhi closed in. Cold energy surged between his hands; one of his limbs turned crystal-clear like an ice shard and, glinting with chilling light, thrust like a spike into the dragon's belly.

Even that impenetrable armor of scales could not wholly stop the strike; the scales split open and his hand sank in over three inch before being stopped by writhing flesh.

When he drew his hand back, blood spattered — ruby streaked with golden light — coating his head and face.

“Hahaha!” Yan Zhi laughed wildly. From the start of the battle he had finally managed to injure his foe, and at once he saw hope of victory. Before the golden dragon could retaliate he withdrew and sneered, “You think you're invincible because of your size? How naive.”

Hearing this, the dragon seemed utterly enraged; its huge body warped and twisted, suddenly shrinking considerably.

The bonds that had held it snapped in an instant.

Yan Zhi was stunned; he had never heard of a demonic beast being able to change its true body's size at will.

He knew of shape-shifting beasts, but what he saw before him was far stranger.

Before he could collect himself, the golden dragon — now several times smaller — lunged at him with freezing claws carrying the stench of death that made Yan Zhi's scalp tingle.

Although its size had contracted, its majesty remained undiminished and was terrifying; moreover, in its smaller form it moved with far greater speed and agility.

As it charged, several golden, chain-like streams of energy shot from its side and wrapped the space around Yan Zhi.

At the same time, long golden spears materialized and barreled in with world-destroying force.

Whish, whish, whish……

In the blink of an eye they pierced the bounds of space and slammed into the place where Yan Zhi stood.

“Impossible!” Yan Zhi cried. His eyes were sharp enough to see that whether the chains or those spears, they were all high-grade martial skills.

How could a demonic beast cast such exquisite martial techniques?

Screaming, Yan Zhi frantically dodged the surging spears but could not shake the pursuing chains.

One stray chain grazed him, and his body suddenly felt heavy as if a mountain of ten thousand pounds pressed down, and even his Divine Sense showed signs of being imprisoned.

Although it only lasted a brief instant, in a contest between such masters a single, fleeting failure could sway the course of the entire battle.
