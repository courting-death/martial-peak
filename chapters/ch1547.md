## Chapter 1547 — Blood Prison Trial

Qian Tong smiled kindly. "Young man, don't be nervous. I only stopped you to ask a few questions. Hmm, if you answer well, these things will be yours."

Saying that, Qian Tong produced several Upper-Level Saint Crystals and tossed them onto the table.

The waiter’s eyes instantly straightened; someone who brought tea and served here could only earn two or three Lower-Level Saint Crystals a month. The few Upper-Level Saint Crystals on the table were an earth-shattering fortune to him.

Save them and you'll never have to worry about food and drink for the rest of your life.

He hurriedly nodded and bowed, saying, “Senior, please ask whatever you wish. This little one will tell you everything I know. Though I’m just an ordinary man who’s never cultivated, I was born and raised here. Whatever it is you want to know, Senior, I won’t let you down!”

"Very good." Qian Tong nodded, pleased at the waiter’s proper manners, and without any unnecessary chatter asked directly, "Tell me, are there any Void King Realm experts here?"

"Void King Realm?" The waiter’s expression grew serious. He glanced at Yang Kai and the others in surprise, then a look of realization crossed his face and he chuckled, "You seniors shouldn't be warriors of Cuiwei Star, right?"

"You are clever!" Qian Tong had no objection; after all, if one were from this star, one would hardly be ignorant of such matters.

Void King Realm experts are top-tier figures on any cultivation star; if they truly hailed from Cuiwei Star, they would certainly have heard of them.

The waiter gave a nervous laugh. "You flatter me, elders; I only spoke casually. Yet since you seniors came here at this time, how could you not have asked about such things?"

"What should we be asking about?" Qian Tong snorted coldly.

The waiter, unhurried, said slowly: "Since you seniors have come here, I suppose it is to take part in that grand event. Though it is a bit early, that's fine — wait a year or two. Some elders have come even earlier. As for whether there are Void King Realm experts, hehe... when has Cuiwei Star ever lacked experts of that rank?"

He wore an air of complacency, as if Void King Realm experts were to be found everywhere on Cuiwei Star.

Qian Tong and the others exchanged glances, their interest aroused. They signaled the waiter to continue.

"To be frank, there are already two or three Void King Realm experts on Cuiwei Star now; at its peak there were even more than ten. Among them, two were top-tier Void King experts at the Third Stage."

"Void King Third Stage? Two of them?" Qian Tong and the others trembled. Their eyes went blank, stunned beyond words by the waiter’s words.

"Is that true?" Mo Yu asked in a deep voice.

"I dare not deceive you; everyone knows of this. If you don't believe me, go inquire and you'll see."

"So you say Cuiwei Star is quite suitable for advancement and breakthrough?" Qian Tong’s eyes gleamed with determination and excitement.

Although he felt that the rule restraints here were not as oppressive as on Dark Star, whether to remain and cultivate here to breakthrough still required careful inquiry.

Having obtained such information from the waiter, he was naturally pleased.

"Of course." The waiter bobbed his head, beaming with pride. "You seniors came here for that very reason, didn't you?"

"You can tell that?" Qian Tong was greatly surprised.

“Senior must be joking. Though I’m just an ordinary person, such a once-in-a-millennium event has long spread across all of Cuiwei Star. Even three-year-old children have heard of it—how could I not know?” the shopkeeper replied respectfully.

“Wait—what once-in-a-millennium event?” Yang Kai looked at him suspiciously. The shopkeeper had mentioned it earlier, but Yang Kai hadn’t paid much attention. Every cultivation star had its own unique spectacles and customs—like the Flowing Flame Sandland of Dark Star, which opened once every few centuries.

Cuiwei Star would naturally have such affairs.

But from the waiter’s words it seemed this grand event was somehow related to Qian Tong and the others' potential breakthroughs, which immediately caught Yang Kai's attention.

At his question, the waiter was stunned, scratched his head, and asked: "What? You seniors didn't come here to participate in the Blood Prison Trial?"

"Blood Prison Trial?" Qian Tong and the others looked at one another, baffled.

"Explain carefully—what is this Blood Prison Trial for?" Yang Kai tossed a few Upper-Level Saint Crystals onto the table and said lightly.

The waiter swallowed, face full of delight; realizing he'd met nobles today, he dared not be negligent. He cleared his throat and began: "The Blood Prison Trial is, in truth, prepared for masters like you."

"How so?" Qian Tong raised an eyebrow.

"Those who take part in the Blood Prison Trial are top-tier experts of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. It's said that inside, they can break through to the Void King Realm!" the waiter said astonishingly.

"Really?" Qian Tong sprang to his feet, moved beyond excited.

The waiter was startled and quickly nodded: "I wouldn't lie. The Blood Prison Trial is indeed like that, though I don't know the specifics — as an ordinary person who has never cultivated, I don't understand the trial's details."

"Then what do you know?" Yang Kai motioned for Qian Tong to calm down and asked the waiter.

"I know this: those Void King lords on Cuiwei Star today all once participated in the Blood Prison Trial. Not only them — many Void King Realm experts across this Star Domain also emerged from the Blood Prison Trial."

"Have warriors from other cultivation stars come here?" Qian Tong frowned.

"Yes. Years ago some came to Cuiwei Star, though not many at first. As the time drew near, more and more arrived, which is why I assumed you were among them..." the waiter said anxiously, looking at Qian Tong and the others.

"I see." Yang Kai nodded. "Tell us what you know about the Blood Prison Trial. Say whatever you know; if you don't know, we won't blame you."

Qian Tong and the others chimed in supportively, encouraging the waiter with their looks.

The waiter steadied himself, thought for a moment, then began to tell the tale.

The Blood Prison Trial is the greatest event on Cuiwei Star, occurring only once every thousand years. Each opening attracts a vast number of Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors to join. The trial itself is said to be brutally bloody, with many warriors falling.

But alongside immense danger, the rewards are astonishing.

It is common for Void King Realm experts to be born from it!

Sometimes more than one emerges!

Thus, despite the danger, Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts flock to it.

The trial is like thousands of troops crossing a single-log bridge. Across the Star Domain there are countless Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts, but Void King Realm experts are exceedingly rare. Even with the Blood Prison Trial's rich opportunities, advancement is obstructed at every turn.

Those Third Stage experts who pour into the Blood Prison Trial may see half of them fall, or none may succeed by the trial's end, yet this does not extinguish their determination to pursue greater strength.

The reason the Blood Prison Trial is so effective lies in the presence of Domains.

The place is saturated with fragmented Domain power that Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors can perceive and absorb; if one can comprehend a Domain's true meaning, there is hope for a breakthrough.

“Why is this Blood Prison filled with Domain powers—and broken ones at that?” Qian Tong asked curiously.

"That stems from an epochal war," the waiter said with a storyteller’s flair, recounting the matter clearly so listeners could easily understand.

According to his telling, the Blood Prison was once a battlefield, a killing ground where more than twenty Void King Realm experts and their numerous disciples fought in bloody combat.

It is said that long ago Cuiwei Star had two top-tier Void King Third Stage experts, each among the very best in the entire Star Domain.

Each led their own faction and were enemies; their forces clashed frequently.

This feud lasted hundreds to thousands of years and eventually escalated until those two great experts themselves were drawn into the conflict.

Moreover, they invited many friends and allies to join the battle.

Friends of Void King Realm experts are naturally of that same rank.

Thus, a war capable of destroying a star erupted in a certain region of Cuiwei Star.

That battle involved more than twenty Void King Realm participants as well as the disciples under those two leaders.

The casualties were incalculable!

No one knows the final outcome; only that afterwards the place was piled with corpses and rivers of blood.

The more than twenty Void King Realm experts seemingly left no survivors — all perished.

From then on the place was called the Blood Prison. It is said that even now that land remains red as if soaked in blood, with traces of the great battle everywhere that time cannot erase.

Hence the Blood Prison came into being.

Within that Blood Prison, various fragmented Domain powers suffuse the area. Such forces are perilous and erratic; anyone below Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cannot withstand them. Only Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors may enter at certain times to comprehend those fragments and gain benefits.

With luck, one might even ascend to the Void King Realm.

If this were the only attraction, perhaps it would not alone lure so many Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts.

Rumor holds that secret treasures used by those Void King Realm experts once remain in the Blood Prison. Each is of Void King-Grade quality and rare beyond the outside world.

It is also said that the legacies of those two top-tier experts are hidden within.

If one could obtain their inheritances, without doubt one could rise to the Void King Realm, and perhaps even reach the heights those two once did.

Such temptations and benefits have made the Blood Prison a coveted prize.

Whenever the Blood Prison Trial opens, Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors across the Star Domain who hear the news all rush here.

At that time Cuiwei Star becomes extraordinarily lively.

The next Blood Prison Trial is only two or three years away, which is why the waiter misunderstood when Qian Tong asked earlier.

He thought Qian Tong and the others had come to take part in the Blood Prison Trial.
