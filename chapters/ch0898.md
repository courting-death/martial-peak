## Chapter 898 — Flying Shuttle

Whoosh... whoosh... whoosh...

The sound of space tearing filled the air, making the eardrums quiver; the long shuttle seemed to be breaking free of spatial constraints, constantly shifting its position.

After several attempts, Yang Kai's eyes grew steadily brighter. He felt he had finally grasped the secret behind this secret treasure.

With a flick of his hand, the long shuttle returned to his palm once more.

Yang Kai concentrated and probed it again.

His Divine Sense wandered through the shuttle, scrutinizing its structure and leaving no detail unexamined.

Though the shuttle was small, once his Divine Sense entered it, it was as if he had stepped into an immeasurably vast space; no matter how he searched, he could not see an end.

Suddenly, a faint, traceless stream of information surged from within the shuttle into Yang Kai's Divine Sense.

Flying Shuttle...

That appeared to be the name of the secret treasure. From the name alone, matching his earlier impressions, the shuttle’s function was clearly for flight.

In short, it was a specialized flying secret treasure.

Secret treasures come in many varieties, and their types differ depending on classification. By function they are mainly offensive, defensive, or auxiliary; of course, some combine offense and defense — the Silver Leaf Yang Kai owned was such a treasure.

By the driving force they use, secret treasures can also be divided into those driven by True Yuan and those driven by Divine Soul.

The latter are generally far more valuable and much harder to refine.

Among secret treasures there exists a special category devoted solely to flight. When deployed, such flying treasures generally allow travel at speeds far surpassing those achieved by martial artists flying unaided.

Yang Kai had seen many flying secret treasures before, in all manner of shapes — sword-shaped, ruler-shaped, chariot-like constructs, and so on.

But he had never encountered one shaped like a long shuttle.

At first glance it somewhat resembled a dugout canoe.

Inside the Flying Shuttle there were no traces of killing arrays, which meant it could not be used offensively; defensive spirit formations seemed to be present, but how strong that defense was remained unknown.

His Divine Sense pushed further inward to investigate.

He discovered something peculiar.

Within the Flying Shuttle, points of light flickered. When his Divine Sense rested there, it felt as though he stood beneath a starry sky, with countless stars stretching into the void.

The internal light was like a miniature starry sky, a cosmos shrunk down and placed inside the shuttle.

There was even a hair-thin spirit thread connecting numerous glimmering points, snaking away into the distance.

Yang Kai frowned, puzzled as to its purpose.

Tracing that spirit thread deeper, he became ever more convinced that the interior of the Flying Shuttle stored something akin to a vastly miniaturized starry sky.

To his regret, the spirit thread snapped at a certain point — likely a consequence of long drifting in the starry void and the thread’s diminished spiritual nature. Where it originally connected to remained unknown.

He shook his head. Having ascertained there was nothing else of concern inside, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense.

Although the treasure’s spiritual nature had severely declined, after so long a time of tempering it could still perform its most basic functions.

Driven by curiosity, Yang Kai immediately stepped out of the Saint Lord’s garden.

He poured True Yuan into it. The Flying Shuttle swelled at once, and in an instant it stretched several zhang in length, silently hovering before him.

Yang Kai’s expression brightened inwardly — just as he’d suspected.

A flying secret treasure capable of carrying people couldn’t possibly remain palm-sized. Who had refined this treasure and what wondrous array had been embedded to allow it to freely expand and contract?

A few zhang was its limit. By eye Yang Kai estimated it could easily carry seven or eight people.

With a thought, the shuttle shrank to two chi long. A faint blue-gray radiance emanated from within, forming a defensive shield.

Yang Kai leapt aboard; the blue light wrapped him perfectly, leaving not the slightest gap, as if tailor-made.

His heart stirred, and True Yuan surged more fiercely.

A streak of azure light flashed in place, and in the next instant Yang Kai and the Flying Shuttle vanished from sight.

Within one of the Nine Peaks, the Ancient Demon Clan’s leaders each sat in meditation to cultivate. Yang Kai had little need to trouble them these days; after receiving much cultivation provision from Xu Hui, the leaders were all studiously increasing their strength.

Suddenly Li Rong’s delicate brows knit; she startled from her meditation, swaying as she stepped outside. Fixing her gaze on a patch of sky, a hint of doubt flickered across her face.

Han Fei and Hua Mo soon appeared at her side.

"Is that Lord’s aura?" Han Fei asked softly, also looking toward the sky.

"Yes, he has gone out," Li Rong nodded slightly. "But that speed...—it's incredibly fast."

As she spoke, her expression shifted: "I can no longer sense him."

As a cultivator at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, Li Rong’s Divine Sense covered hundreds of miles or more. From when she first detected Yang Kai’s movement until now, only three breaths had passed. In that brief span, Yang Kai had already left the bounds of her perception.

Such speed was staggering; in this world no one could possess such uncanny velocity.

"Why would His Lord go out at a time like this?" Hua Mo’s face showed puzzlement.

"I don’t know."

"Should we follow and escort him..." Hua Mo hesitated.

"We don’t even know where he went; how could we follow?" Li Rong gave a bitter smile. "Besides, at that speed, I doubt anyone could catch up to him."

Hearing this, Han Fei and Hua Mo relaxed. If no one could pursue Yang Kai, then he could not be in danger.

While the three leaders spoke, many martial artists waiting in line outside the Nine Peaks for pill-refinement also looked up with grave expressions.

Just before, a clear azure light had streaked above them so swiftly that when they reacted, their attempts to trace it with Divine Sense lagged far behind the departing glow.

The discovery horrified them.

There were many formidable experts among those gathered; who claimed competence, but before that azure streak they were utterly powerless.

Faces shifted as they guessed at which mighty figure had passed by and what method had been used to travel so quickly.

Yet none could find a clue.

In midair Yang Kai’s expression was wild with excitement and almost incredulous at all he had just experienced.

The scenery beneath his feet rushed away like a surging river. The speed was beyond description. His naked eye could not catch any single view before it was flung far behind.

The Flying Shuttle’s speed far exceeded his expectations.

Yang Kai himself was not slow; with his Wind-and-Thunder Wings even a Second Stage Saint Realm expert might not catch him.

But now his speed had surpassed this world’s limits, approaching the kind of movement seen when tearing space itself.

In an instant he crossed hundreds of li.

Most astonishingly, the True Yuan required to pilot the Flying Shuttle was not great. And with the protection of that blue shield, there was no worry of adverse winds blinding him; standing on the shuttle felt as steady as walking on flat ground.

Heart racing, Yang Kai had no intention of slowing; if anything, he pushed the speed even further.

Gradually, as he grew familiar with the treasure, Yang Kai could command it at will and came to relish the lightning-like sensation.

He was elated beyond measure.

Watching the land blur beneath him like flowing water, his mood surged with an odd exhilaration.

Only after half a day did that elation slowly recede, and Yang Kai began to reduce his speed.

Looking up, in the far distance he saw a realm draped in pristine white snow. The land beneath the snow stirred a faint sense of familiarity within him.

Strange light crossed his eyes as he examined it more closely.

Before long a vast, magnificent city came into view.

His expression grew still stranger.

He steered toward the city, and after the time it took a single incense stick to burn, Yang Kai materialized on one of its streets.

Giant Stone City!

This was Giant Stone City, located tens of thousands of li from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land!

Yang Kai’s face flickered with a sense of unreality.

When he led the Ancient Demon Clan from here to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, it had taken them a full two months to reach the outskirts of the Nine Peaks.

Although the Ancient Demon Clan numbered many and moved slowly, if Yang Kai had traveled alone without counting consumption, it would have taken him twenty or thirty days to get from here to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Yet now, the return trip had taken less than a single day!

Strictly speaking, it should be about twenty hours.

The difference in time consumption was simply incomparable.

In that instant Yang Kai fully recognized the terrifying speed of the Flying Shuttle and the priceless nature of this flying treasure.

With such a treasure, any destination would be far easier to reach.

He reverently stored the treasure within and strolled toward the Alchemists' Association.

Du Wan had already gone to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. At Giant Stone City’s Alchemists' Association only Ye Xiong, Mi Na, and Wu’er remained.

They were surprised by Yang Kai’s sudden arrival, but welcomed him with genuine delight.

Yang Kai stayed only a single day at the Alchemists' Association, teaching Wu’er and Mi Na some pill-refining methods and leaving them a few basic spirit formations before departing.

He went to the Tianxiao Sect.

Now the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, he had been tied up with trivial matters and seldom had time to return. This chance visit compelled him to see his senior aunt and uncles, and his sect’s founding master.

At Qixiu Peak, when Yang Kai returned, his senior uncle Fei Yu was drunk to the point that her face flushed like a peach blossom; her eyes were moist and alluring as she lay on a stone table in the cave, much of her fair skin exposed.

Fei Yu cultivated a water-based technique; she did not drink merely for pleasure but to refine alcohol into her body to enhance the potency of her True Yuan.

Yang Kai had long observed this, but found her level of drunkenness somewhat helpless to accept.
