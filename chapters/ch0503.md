## Chapter 503 — Can’t I Have Two Women?

Slowly setting Qiu Yimeng down, Yang Kai strode over toward Pang Chi.

Miss Qiu’s expression remained calm, showing no trace of embarrassment despite having been seen in such close proximity to Yang Kai. Yet her curiosity deepened.

Because when Yang Kai had just released her, she clearly felt his hand trembling slightly.

For such a resolute man to have that reaction… what news could this Pang bring?

“Young Master!” Seeing Yang Kai appear, Pang Chi immediately stood and bowed in salute. Without wasting words, he said, “The Bamboo Segment Gang spent more than half a year investigating, and with a few hundred men scouting around, they have finally found the people you seek, Young Master.”

Yang Kai took a slow breath and asked, “Where?”

Even before the succession battle began, Yang Kai had already commanded the Bamboo Segment Gang to gather intelligence on Su Yan and the others. Only now had they managed to find a lead.

“To the northwest, about three thousand li from War City, there is a small village encircled by mountains. Those people seem to be living in seclusion there.”

“Are you sure?”

“Basically certain. Though no direct contact was made, based on your previous descriptions, that's undoubtedly the group you seek. The village is newly established, just over a year ago, and all the inhabitants are warriors, numbering around a hundred.”

“Good, good, good.” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, a heavy stone lifting from his heart. He patted Pang Chi on the shoulder, praising, “Well done.”

Pang Chi was instantly ecstatic, his face flushed, words tumbling out incoherently, “I am merely doing my duty.”

As he spoke, he hurriedly pulled out a map from his bosom and handed it to Yang Kai. “This is the route drawn up by my men. I hope it helps you, Young Master.”

“Well done.” Yang Kai grinned, took the map, and immediately understood the location of the mountain-surrounded village.

It further confirmed Pang Chi’s guess, for this position was not far from where Yang Kai and Ling Taixu had been transported from the Void Horn Pathway.

Su Yan and the others must have settled here shortly after leaving that location.

“Yang Kai, are you looking for someone?” Qiu Yimeng approached to ask. She had remained silent earlier, observing Yang Kai’s extreme changes in expression, realizing that the person he sought must be very important to him.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded, carefully putting away the map.

“What kind of people?”

“Some fellow disciples.” Yang Kai took a deep breath, recalling Su Yan’s face, his gaze softening.

“More than just fellow disciples, I suppose?” Qiu Yimeng smiled knowingly, probing intentionally. “Now that you’ve found them, what will you do?”

“Go and bring them here.” Yang Kai smiled at her.

“No.” Qiu Yimeng slowly shook her head.

Yang Kai’s smile faded quickly, his eyes narrowing coldly as he asked, “What do you mean?”

Qiu Yimeng spoke gently, “Don’t be quick to anger—just hear me out. Since they are your fellow disciples, they must be disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, right? Lingxiao Pavilion is still considered an Evil Sect, the very sect that produced the Evil Lord. As long as they don't reveal themselves publicly, things are fine. But if you bring them to War City, it will definitely cause controversy. If they really come, do you think your Second Brother won’t stir trouble to upset you? Especially now, every move of yours affects the tide of the succession battle.”

Yang Kai frowned tightly. Though he knew Qiu Yimeng spoke the truth, his heart could not agree.

Qiu Yimeng continued, “It’s been over half a year since the Yang Family’s succession battle began. Even if your fellow disciples seclude themselves in the mountains, they must have heard something. They know you are in War City yet have not come to join you, clearly because they do not wish to cause you trouble. If you recklessly bring them here, you would only be wasting their painstaking efforts.

“I know, which is all the more reason to bring them here,” Yang Kai said in a low voice. “Though their secluded place is decent, if the Bamboo Segment Gang could find them, so can others. If someone hostile learns of them…”

Su Yan’s group was a mixed bag. Over a year ago during their separation, several had reached the Divine Roaming Realm, though not highly advanced; the rest ranged from True Yuan Realm, Separation and Union Realm, even some at Qi Movement Realm.

If discovered and besieged by some force, they would be helpless victims. Only by placing them nearby could Yang Kai feel at ease.

Qiu Yimeng’s brows knitted tightly as she inhaled deeply. “They must come here?”

“Yes, that’s not negotiable.” Yang Kai nodded.

Fully understanding Yang Kai’s temperament, Miss Qiu knew further argument was useless and nodded. “Very well. I’ll go on your behalf.”

Yang Kai waved his hand. “No, I’ll go myself.”

“No!” Qiu Yimeng suddenly grew anxious. “What on earth are you thinking? Even if those people matter to you, given your current situation and status, you can’t just leave War City. How many people do you intend to bring?”

“I’m just going to fetch them, not to fight. I’ll go quietly and return quietly. It’s only a few days’ journey over three thousand li.” Yang Kai frowned.

“What if your whereabouts are exposed? If not for yourself, think of the many allies at the estate! They have sacrificed so much and suffered many casualties. Don’t they want to see you succeed in the succession battle? What if something happens to you? How would you face them?”

As she spoke, Qiu Yimeng stepped forward, grabbing Yang Kai’s arm and holding tight, looking as stubborn as a little girl, refusing to relent.

Though she knew Qiu Yimeng was acting out of concern for the greater good, Yang Kai remained firm and shook his head. “I must go. If I don’t, they will never come!”

Since Su Yan and the others hadn’t come to War City all this time, they must have many misgivings. If Qiu Yimeng went to them, they wouldn’t come; they might vanish from the world’s view again. Then it would be even harder to find them.

“I don’t care! If you want to bring them here, fine. I’ll run the errand for you. But you are not going anywhere!”

“Can you be a little more mature?”

“I’ve always been a little woman. Why change now? Do you like maturity?”

“Then do you realize who caused this entire mess?” Yang Kai became impatient. He hated endless disputes and preferred to act decisively and swiftly. Now with Qiu Yimeng clutching him, he was vexed. His mind was filled with thoughts of Su Yan and their group, wishing he could fly three thousand li instantly.

“What?”

“Nothing.” Yang Kai didn’t want to say more.

If not for Qiu Yimeng’s group causing trouble at Lingxiao Pavilion back then, he wouldn’t have been sent to Cangyun Evil Land, nor separated from Su Yan for so long. In fact, Miss Qiu was the real culprit behind their separation. Because of this, Yang Kai’s attitude toward Qiu Yimeng had been harsh in the past, but since the succession battle started, and they interacted more, his resentment gradually lessened.

“Um… there are some matters at the gang. Young Master, I must leave now,” Pang Chi said uneasily nearby, eager to slip away after seizing the chance to speak.

“You can’t go!” Qiu Yimeng shot him a glance. “Stay at the estate for a few days.”

“Yes, I take my leave!” Pang Chi knew Qiu Yimeng kept him close to prevent leaking information. Though it made him feel distrusted, he dared not complain.

After Pang Chi left, Qiu Yimeng finally loosened her grip on Yang Kai. Her eyes clouded with memories as she slowly said, “I remember when Xiaoman and I went to your Lingxiao Pavilion before, we saw you intimately close with a woman below the Dragon Confinement Ravine… Is she the one you care for?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Then what about Xia Ningshang at the estate?” Qiu Yimeng became curious. “It seems your relationship with her is special too.”

Yang Kai looked at her oddly. “Can’t I have two women?”

Qiu Yimeng’s face darkened, anger flashing in her eyes. “Shameless, disgraceful, no different from Huo Xingchen! Men are all like this! You do whatever you want. I’ll never care about you again.”

With that, Miss Qiu angrily left. She knew she couldn’t persuade Yang Kai. Once he decided, no one could sway him. Moreover, Yang Kai had a point; if he didn’t go, Lingxiao Pavilion’s people would never come to War City.

But considering the whole situation, Qiu Yimeng had no choice but to do her best to stop him.

Unfortunately, she failed.

Luckily, things were calm in War City recently. Even if Yang Kai wasn’t at the estate, their forces were enough to repel any attack.

At night, a figure vanished into the starry sky unnoticed by all except Qiu Yimeng. It was Yang Kai.

He had taken Ying Jiu with him.

Of all the Blood Servants, only Ying Jiu, an expert in stealth and assassination, had the qualifications and strength to move silently with him. No one else could.

Meng Wuya and Di Mo might have the ability, but Shopkeeper Meng disliked interfering in Yang Kai’s affairs. As for Di Mo, he had to stay. Without him, Tang Yuxian would be the only top expert at the estate, leading to potential mishaps.

With Di Mo and Yuxian stationed there, Yang Kai could rest easy.

“Hopefully nothing bad happens.” Qiu Yimeng sighed softly, helpless to worry about this man’s safety because of the succession battle.

Meanwhile, at Yang Zhao’s estate.

Ye Xinrou walked gracefully into Yang Zhao’s room, smiling as she said, “Second Young Master, there is news about the matter you wanted to investigate.”

“Oh?” Yang Zhao’s brows lifted, his face brightening. “Speak!”

“Pang Chi from the Bamboo Segment Gang in Zhongdu arrived at War City today and has not left the Young Master’s estate since entering.”
