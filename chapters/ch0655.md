## Chapter 655 — Whoever Mines It Claims It

After a fierce battle, they were pursued by Chu Jian for a long time; although both had abundant True Yuan, their physical strength and spirit had been heavily drained.

After sitting for a moment, the two of them both entered a meditative state.

Their spirit and physical strength recovered rapidly.

Two hours later Yang Kai opened his eyes; they glittered brightly—he had returned to his peak state.

Han Fei was still leaning against him; although she had not fully awakened, her breathing was unquestionably much steadier.

Pressed against Yang Kai, her delicate body felt indescribably soft, and the cold, striking woman carried a faint natural fragrance that, breathed in, made Yang Kai feel even more invigorated.

After a while she gradually came to, noticed her earlier lapse in propriety, moved a short distance away from Yang Kai of her own accord, and coldly asked, "What do we do now?"

"First let’s take a look around." Yang Kai said as he stood, his True Yuan flowing through his body and bursting forth in a bright light that illuminated the surroundings.

Han Fei couldn't help frowning; she was somewhat displeased by the burning aura around Yang Kai—this was not personal, but rather an instinctive repulsion between demonic energy and yang energy.

"I seem to have some torches," Han Fei said, and, as if from nowhere, produced two torches; Yang Kai smiled faintly, snapped his fingers to light them, and each of them took one as they began to examine their surroundings.

It was indeed, as Yang Kai had observed before, a huge, spacious lava cavern.

It rose to over a hundred zhang in height, and the interior was the size of more than a dozen houses, suffused with an extremely dense heaven-and-earth energy—not yang qi, but a pure energy any martial artist could absorb.

The two of them explored the cavern for a while and found nothing, but did discover a corridor leading deeper in.

"Want to go in and take a look? Or wait here for Li Rong to come rescue us?" Yang Kai raised his torch and looked at Han Fei as he asked.

Curiosity shone in Han Fei’s beautiful eyes; after hesitating a moment she said, "Even if Lady Li learns of this, she might not know we’re down below. This is a rare chance—let’s go in and see."

"All right." Yang Kai smiled.

This place was a forbidden area of the Ancient Demon Clan; even the four chief commanders would not come here lightly, and if not for Yang Kai’s protection Han Fei could never have safely reached this cavern—she would have been melted by the magma long ago.

She was naturally very curious about what secrets such a place might hold.

This was a location the Ancient Demon Clan had lived nearby for countless years yet had never ventured into; the woman's innate curiosity led her to choose exploration.

They pressed deeper along the corridor; the surrounding walls were extraordinarily solid.

They had no idea how long they had walked, or how far they had gone, but the two of them still found nothing.

Han Fei, walking behind Yang Kai, began to pant heavily and stagger.

Such wounds that penetrated the body, though not life-threatening, still affected her greatly.

"Rest for a bit," Yang Kai suggested.

Han Fei said nothing; she understood he was considering her well‑being.

When they sat to rest, Yang Kai produced a Healing Pill and handed it over; Han Fei glanced at him, asked no questions, accepted it, and swallowed it.

"You don’t have any Healing Pills on you?" Yang Kai frowned and asked.

"We do not refine pills—where would we have Healing Pills?" Han Fei answered coolly.

"You should have said earlier..." Yang Kai muttered inwardly; this woman’s pride really knew no bounds—suffering such severe wounds, she would rather heal naturally than ask him for a pill.

He had assumed that as one of the four chief commanders she would at least carry some common pills.

"How embarrassing," Han Fei snorted, thought for a moment, then suddenly produced some items and handed them to Yang Kai, asking, "Want some water?"

Yang Kai was surprised; without a word he took the waterskin she offered and drank a few mouthfuls.

Han Fei then asked, "Want something to eat?"

This time she handed over a few fruits Yang Kai had never seen before; they contained quite concentrated energy—clearly fine items.

This woman... was doing everything she could to repay her debt of gratitude? Yang Kai stared at her in surprise and immediately understood what she was thinking.

Yang Kai shook his head silently, took the fruits she offered, and popped them into his mouth.

"You seem to be carrying a lot of things," Yang Kai said, looking her up and down, curious where she hid them all.

The Spatial Pouch was a secret treasure used for storage—Yang Kai knew this; since arriving on Tongxuan Continent he had seen Spatial Pouches on many people.

Several small captains of the Duao Alliance carried them, and the Enchantress he had killed had one as well.

But Han Fei did not have one, which puzzled Yang Kai—how did she store her items?

"I collect things and usually keep them in a Void Ring for emergencies," Han Fei explained calmly, and she took a fruit and ate it in small bites.

"Void Ring?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened, and he fixed his gaze on the antiquated ring on the index finger of Han Fei’s right hand.

The ring was jet black and clearly old.

"A storage secret treasure more refined than a Spatial Pouch—one would rarely see such things outside; only long‑established powers with deep roots possess them," Han Fei explained.

Staring at the Void Ring on her hand, a thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind and he exclaimed in astonishment, "Could it have been made from Soul‑Calming Stone?"

"You know Soul‑Calming Stone?" Han Fei was taken aback.

Yang Kai nodded slightly—how could he not know? His Wordless Black Book was entirely made from Soul‑Calming Stone.

"There is some Soul‑Calming Stone in it, but not entirely. It is said that the Great Demon God once obtained a large slab of Soul‑Calming Stone and used it somewhere unknown; only scraps remained. Those scraps were taken by exceptionally skilled craftsmen and, combined with other materials, forged into several Void Rings, which are now guarded by the four chief commanders."

Hearing this, Yang Kai thought carefully and realized Li Rong and Hua Mo also wore rings.

So these rings were storage secret treasures even higher in quality than Spatial Pouches.

"Enough about that—owing you such a great favor this time, I won't be thinking to use you and then kill you, but I can't guarantee Hua Mo thinks the same. However, rest assured: with Lady Li's protection, Hua Mo will not make a move against you lightly," Han Fei suddenly said.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, understanding that her words were a gesture of goodwill.

"I don't quite understand why Lady Li favors you so much and cares for you like this."

"I don't know either," Yang Kai shrugged. "If there's a chance later, you can ask Li Rong for me and find out what she thinks."

Half an hour later the two of them raised their torches and set off exploring again; perhaps because of the Healing Pill, Han Fei's condition was much improved.

The deeper they went, the denser the nearby heaven‑and‑earth energy became; it seemed there might be a convergence point below.

Recalling the underground situation in Zhongdu, Yang Kai's mind jolted and he formed a bold conjecture: "Could there be an Earth Vein down here?"

Han Fei thought for a moment and then nodded in agreement; "Quite possible."

The two of them exchanged a glance and grew excited, their pace involuntarily quickening.

After walking for some time Yang Kai suddenly discovered they had reached a dead end with no way forward.

Yet on the rock face ahead, dots of light shimmered like stars.

"What is that?" Yang Kai's expression turned puzzled as he stepped forward to investigate.

Han Fei hurried up as well, and upon seeing the scene her expression could not help but move.

The two of them reached out, circulated their True Yuan, and broke open the rock face; after some rummaging Yang Kai found among the rubble an object about the size of a fist, pure and flawless like a jewel.

Feeling the energy within it and looking at its appearance, Yang Kai hurriedly said, "Han Fei, come take a look—could this be a Crystal Stone?"

Han Fei's face looked strange; she hadn't expected this human boy to address her by name so directly, but her attention was drawn to the object in his hand; after examining it she nodded, "It truly is a Crystal Stone."

"A real Crystal Stone?" Yang Kai gaped, "This big?"

He had used Crystal Stones before—those obtained from Yun Xuan of the Duao Alliance and the ones from Li Rong had been about walnut‑sized, very regular in shape and volume—yet here at the base of a volcano they had found a fist‑sized Crystal Stone.

"Could this be a Crystal Stone vein?" Han Fei grew excited and immediately searched further; before long she found another slightly smaller Crystal Stone among the rubble—still several times larger than the usual stones.

"It truly is a Crystal Stone vein!" Han Fei declared with certainty.

"Didn't you say the area beneath the volcano was Yang Crystal Ore?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"I only read that in records—it may have been mistaken," Han Fei explained. "But Crystal Stones are far more valuable than Yang Crystal, especially to our Ancient Demon Clan..."

The Yang Crystal Ore below could not be used by her kin and thus would be of little value to them, whereas Crystal Stones could be used by any martial artist.

They had been trapped here for countless years, and the Crystal Stones accumulated in Mo Shen Fort had long been used up; many of her clansmen had never even seen a Crystal Stone.

Even someone like Pan Lang coveted the fifty Crystal Stones Yang Kai had when he learned of them.

This showed just how scarce Crystal Stones were in this Small Xuan Realm.

"We're rich..." Han Fei's beautiful eyes shone with an odd light as she murmured.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Whoever mines it gets it."

"Don't be so shameless—this is the territory of my Ancient Demon Clan; the things here rightfully belong to my clan!" Han Fei snapped in annoyance.

"You're being greedy," Yang Kai said, expression unchanged. "Since this is a Crystal Stone vein, who knows how many crystals it holds. And without me, could you even move freely? I could drop you and leave right now—let's see how you fare mining Crystal Stones on your own."

"You... you shameless wretch!" Han Fei finally lost her temper; she had been protected by Yang Kai's True Yuan down here—without him she could not move freely, let alone mine Crystal Stones.

"Then goodbye, I'm leaving. You can keep these Crystal Stones for company; when you die I'll come back and mine them." Yang Kai said this and waved his hand, turning to leave.
