## Chapter 909 — Oil Exhausted, Lamp Spent

The Heavenly Journey Palace shot out like a streak of light and vanished from everyone's sight; Yang Kai froze where he stood.

“It flew away... what the hell is going on?” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox shouted.

“Meng Wuya is over there!” Lei Long's eyes narrowed as he said decisively.

Yang Kai quickened his pace and sprinted in the direction the Heavenly Journey Palace had vanished, his face a mixture of excitement and anxiety.

Great Lord Lei Long waved his hand and barked, “All of you, follow! That person who was once the human race's greatest expert might actually be here.”

“The human race's greatest expert? I want to see this for myself,” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox's eyes brightened noticeably.

To be called the first among humans, that Meng Wuya must possess extraordinary ability; otherwise the humans world would never have granted him such a title.

The place they arrived at was an open, desolate field, scattered with rubble like a broken stone ridge.

Rising from the ground were strange stone pillars—eight in total—arranged in an octagonal array, each radiating extremely intense energy fluctuations.

Those energy fluctuations differed in nature: there was the scorching breath of flame, the biting chill of ice, an insidious, pervasive poisonous aura, and lightning charging like a rushing torrent...

Different profound intents of power flowed here and converged, creating a terrifyingly ominous region.

Atop one of those octagonal pillars, an old man with white hair was bound by an invisible force; he could not move or speak, his head bowed, his clothes tattered like a beggar's, and his life force flickered, teetering on the edge.

Crackling and rumbling sounds never ceased; from among the eight pillars bursts of shocking force erupted from time to time and surged toward the old man.

Those were powers capable of destroying heaven and earth; the old man had apparently endured their lashings for a long time and was barely clinging to life, yet he still mustered his last breath to refuse letting his life vanish.

Flames charred his flesh, lightning tore through his body and burned his organs, and poisonous toxins seeped into every inch of his blood and flesh, tinting his skin a black-green sheen.

Outside the octagonal pillars, a veiled woman sat cross-legged, her eyes clear as crystal and immaculate; strange power burst from her delicate frame, and as she gauged the surges from the pillars she waved her pale hands ceaselessly, dispelling and sharing the horrific harm assailing the old man.

She was slight, her face veiled by a thin gauze so her features could not be made out; a blue gem adorned her forehead, as clear as her beautiful eyes.

Tears stained her lovely face but none fell—it seemed her eyes had already been drained dry from crying.

Her delicate body trembled as she poured her strength out continuously, trying to rescue the old man from the octagonal pillars, yet she was utterly powerless.

Pill after pill was swallowed to restore her depleted energy.

Boom...

Another bolt of lightning struck from one of the pillars, thick as a thigh, blasting into the old man's body, tearing him open and splattering blood; the shock roused him from unconsciousness and he turned his dim gaze toward the woman, pursed his lips and tried to speak, but no sound came out.

The woman, however, understood his intent and kept shaking her head.

Guilt, bitter unwillingness, and stubborn resolve filled the old man's eyes.

Just then he seemed to perceive something and mustered all his remaining strength to look to one side.

From that direction a streak of light shot forth and, with lightning speed, entered his body.

The old man's body trembled and disbelief crossed his face; the once-dim eyes suddenly shone with startling light.

In the next instant a palace-like barrier flared to life, enveloping the old man's whole body and blocking the forces attacking from all sides.

The returning streak of light seemed to have restored a bit of color to his face, and his vitality recovered slightly.

The woman sitting outside the octagonal pillars exhaled and widened her eyes; she turned her head to look in the direction the streak of light had come from and just then saw a heroic, imposing figure gradually taking shape in the gray mist.

Their eyes met; tears the woman thought had been exhausted suddenly overflowed and rolled down her cheeks.

Yang Kai stared at her, feeling his blood boil; his fingertips trembled and he cracked a smile, his voice so gentle it might melt stone: “Little Senior Sister, I finally found you.”

Standing before him was Xia Ningshang—the very woman he had searched for across the Tongxuan Continent for ten years!

She was just as she had been when he left Zhongdu; not a trace of time seemed to have touched her.

The only difference was her figure, which was fuller than before.

“Junior Brother?” Xia Ningshang could hardly believe what she saw and murmured, “Is this—am I dreaming?”

Yang Kai shook his head and stepped forward toward her.

Xia Ningshang trembled until Yang Kai enfolded her in his arms; feeling the warmth of his chest, she finally confirmed that this was not a dream or an illusion.

Her long-cherished Junior Brother had truly come to find her!

In an instant Xia Ningshang's mind steadied; in her darkest moment she suddenly had someone to rely on.

Tears soaked Yang Kai's clothes; carrying his Little Senior Sister's warmth, Yang Kai drew a soft breath and turned his gaze to the old man who seemed nailed to a pillar not far off.

His eyes narrowed and Yang Kai almost cried out in horror.

Shopkeeper Meng!

The Meng Wuya who had helped him so much when he was weak now looked gaunt and withered, a walking skeleton—one could hardly say he still looked human.

Yang Kai couldn't imagine what torments he had endured.

“How could it come to this?” Yang Kai asked, his expression grave.

In his memory Meng Wuya had always worn a calm, resolute expression, as if nothing in the world could truly trouble him.

He had appeared invincible before the world, often shocking and making those who opposed him regret it bitterly.

Yet now this once-unstoppable Meng Wuya looked as if he were dying; Yang Kai found it hard to accept.

“My master and I entered some ruins of the demon race and must have triggered some seal; we were sent here. When I woke, my master was trapped on that pillar, and I don't know what those eight columns are—constantly releasing power to torture him. I tried to free him but was powerless... Junior Brother, please save Master. If you don't get him out soon he'll truly die,” Xia Ningshang sobbed, pleading.

She had been found by Meng Wuya when she was very young; he had raised her single-handedly and taught her everything. She regarded that master as her most important family.

Watching Meng Wuya suffer each day, Xia Ningshang felt the pain as if it were her own and was torn apart.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded, patted Xia Ningshang's head, and channeled a subtle force into her body, speaking softly: “Don't worry. Now that I'm here I'll get him out. You should rest.”

Xia Ningshang's eyelids immediately grew heavy; Yang Kai's words were like a spell that instantly sent her into slumber.

Xia Ningshang was on the verge of total exhaustion—Yang Kai could see that clearly.

They had been trapped here for who knew how long; his Little Senior Sister had surely not rested, recklessly pouring her own strength out and likely harming her body.

She had to rest.

Meng Wuya, bound to the pillar, looked at Yang Kai; gratitude surfaced in his murky eyes, and a faint transmission of thought reached Yang Kai: to leave this place.

If Yang Kai could take Xia Ningshang away safely, Meng Wuya would die content.

He had been tormented for so long and was clinging to his last breath simply because he couldn't bear to be without his beloved disciple.

Their eyes met; Yang Kai showed little emotion, turned, picked up the unconscious Xia Ningshang, and headed back the way he had come.

At that moment four yao experts and Li Rong had arrived nearby; they all stopped and stared in stunned silence, unsure what to make of the scene.

“Master, this young lady—” Li Rong asked in a low voice when she noticed Yang Kai's odd expression.

“She's my Senior Sister,” Yang Kai replied as he set her down in a safe spot.

“Your Senior Sister?” Li Rong was moved and took a closer look at Xia Ningshang. Though veiled and young, her inner power was disordered from overuse, yet her cultivation matched Yang Kai's—Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

The four yao had noticed as well; the two Great Lords exchanged a horrified glance.

They had thought Yang Kai as a young Third Stage Transcendent was already remarkable, and had never expected his mysterious Senior Sister to be the same.

Yang Kai was from the Tianxiao Sect—does this mean this woman was from Tianxiao Sect too?

Does that sect train disciples this impressively?

After laying Xia Ningshang down, Yang Kai turned back to gaze at Meng Wuya and then said in a low voice, “Great Lord Lei Long, I know Shopkeeper Meng and you yao have some past grievances, but I hope you won't make trouble for him now.”

“That fellow would be Meng Wuya?” Lei Long frowned and looked toward the old man.

Had Yang Kai not pointed it out, Lei Long wouldn't have been certain, but upon closer inspection the trapped old man did bear some resemblance to the person he'd seen in the past.

“This is the human race's greatest expert? How could he end up like this?” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox frowned; Meng Wuya's condition was heartbreaking.

“Indeed, it's Meng Wuya!” Yang Kai nodded. “I'm going to get him out. I don't ask you yao to help—just don't interfere!”
