## Chapter 1534 — Bibo City

“Battle Sky City is now under the control of the Lingxiao Sect.” The green-clad girl who had been standing behind Yang Kai suddenly cut in.

She seemed intent on drawing Yang Kai's attention.

Which girl isn't quick to fall in love? Just now Yang Kai had descended like a god and saved her life; for someone her age, the hero-saving-beauty scenario was the most intoxicating of spectacles.

Moreover, from the side Yang Kai's face was stern and resolute, his figure solid; he was not very old and carried an aura that made her feel comfortable. Of course she wanted to assert her presence and get noticed.

“Lingxiao Sect, huh…” Yang Kai laughed, glancing back at her.

The girl's face flushed slightly, and she excitedly explained, “Yes, you've surely heard of them — they're a sect that only rose to prominence in recent years. I heard their main headquarters is in the Flowing Flame Sandland. They even exterminated Star Emperor Mountain, the Battle Sky Alliance, and the Leitai Sect. Now on Dark Star, the Lingxiao Sect is the most powerful sect.”

She chattered on and on, as if she had no end to say; her disposition was very lively.

“Fei’er.” The old man shot the girl a glance, silently reproaching the little miss for speaking without knowing her place and lacking manners.

“No matter, I have heard of the Lingxiao Sect.” Yang Kai chuckled. “I didn't expect them to be this famous. Eh, carry on — I won't disturb you.”

He had come here simply to learn where the nearby cities lay; now that he had the information he didn't intend to stay long.

Just as he indicated he would leave, the green-clad girl suddenly called out coquettishly, “Wait.”

“What?” Yang Kai looked at her in mild surprise.

“Second Uncle, we’ve been out for quite some time now. Shouldn’t we head back? Otherwise, Father and the others will start worrying. Besides, Third Brother and the rest are injured—it’s not suitable for us to stay here any longer.” The green-clad young girl looked toward the old man as she spoke.

“Mm, you have a point — it's time to return.” The old man nodded gently.

“Then let's go with him; it'll be good to have someone to look after us on the way.” the green-clad girl suggested.

The old man immediately looked at Yang Kai with difficulty. To be honest, he hoped Yang Kai would accompany them. After all, Yang Kai had already displayed his strength. The return journey held no great danger, but one never wanted to tempt fate; with Yang Kai's protection the trip would surely be safer.

The girl’s suggestion was one he quite agreed with—but he had no idea what Yang Kai intended.

“All right. I also don't know the exact location of Bibo City. Then you'll have to guide me.” Yang Kai smiled faintly and nodded in agreement.

It happened to be on his way, and Yang Kai was in no particular hurry.

“Then this old man must thank you, Young Brother.” The old man said joyfully.

“I'll go gather the materials.” The green-clad girl cried out and ran over to the cracked Copper-Head Tiger lying dead on the ground.

The old man smiled bitterly and shook his head, his face apologetic. “Young Brother, don't take offense. Fei’er is simply like this by nature. Rest assured, those materials I'll present you in full shortly.”

“No need, keep them. They are of no use to me.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

The bodily materials of an Eighth-Tier demonic beast were indeed of little use to him.

The wealth Yang Kai possessed was beyond ordinary people's imagination.

At his words the old man's eyes brightened. Once he confirmed Yang Kai truly did not need the materials, he could not help feeling boundlessly grateful.

The inner core and the head of the Copper-Head Tiger would be fine gains for them.

Soon, with the help of a few others, the green-clad girl finished processing the demonic beast's remains. It was obvious these young people were experienced at such tasks, handling them with practiced ease — clearly they did this often.

After a brief tidy, Yang Kai set off with these people, heading for Bibo City.

The green-clad girl's nature was indeed lively and curious; once she opened her mouth there was no stopping her, chattering endlessly.

She asked Yang Kai his name, where he came from, and what his background was—questions others might shy away from—but she seemed completely unaware of such taboos, asking them as naturally as breathing.

Since they were traveling anyway, Yang Kai chatted with her idly to pass the time.

After much talk she didn't elicit much information about Yang Kai, but she fully laid out her own background.

The old man listened awkwardly. Fortunately he could see Yang Kai had no ill intent and let matters be, deciding to reprimand the girl properly once they returned home so she would learn that strangers could be treacherous and she mustn't be so open.

Along the way demonic beasts occasionally blocked their path, but the old man and the others needn't worry — Yang Kai dealt with them with ease.

They reaped a fair reward from it.

The old man and the young people worshipped Yang Kai greatly. They all appeared to be of similar age, yet Yang Kai's strength surpassed them by a wide margin.

Worship and respect for the strong is a natural trait of martial artists; Yang Kai's performance completely won over these young people.

A distance of tens of thousands of li: if Yang Kai traveled alone it would only take him an hour or two, but accompanying the old man and the others consumed a full day.

One day later, a city standing on the edge of the plain came into view. They reached the city gate, paid some Crystal Stone, and entered the city without incident.

“Thank you all for guiding me. We'll part ways here — take care!” Yang Kai cupped his fist, then, with a flash, slipped into the crowd and vanished from sight.

The green-clad girl called after him several times, but Yang Kai did not turn back; she pouted unhappily.

“Let's go. First we'll sell today's gains — I wonder what price they'll fetch.” The old man sighed and then led the way.

Yang Kai walked along Bibo City's wide streets, looking left and right with great interest.

He did not hurry to find the city's Space Array.

Since this place was an affiliate of Battle Sky City, it belonged to the Lingxiao Sect; as the head of a sect he could make use of the Space Array — he doubted the city lord would lack the discernment for such a thing.

But after secluded cultivation in the Small Xuan Realm for several years and finally breaking free, he wanted to relax.

He wandered to savor the local customs and visited shops at leisure. Yang Kai was in high spirits and his mindset settled and grew steady without his realizing it.

In the Small Xuan Realm his cultivation had advanced to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; with that came the duty to stabilize his state of mind, and he would not neglect it.

Half a day later he entered a tavern.

Going up to the third floor, he ordered fine wine and good food brought to him. Yang Kai sat by the window and gazed at the view below.

Before long the table was laden with precious dishes. Yang Kai sipped strong liquor and ate delicious food, completely at ease.

Idly he turned his head and glanced toward a nearby table, casting a faintly interested look at two martial artists seated there.

The third floor was not crowded. The two had been engaging in lofty conversation; Yang Kai had overheard them mentioning the Lingxiao Sect.

The Lingxiao Sect's rise had been rapid. Although he had learned some of their situation from the green-clad girl, Yang Kai did not know the full details. Hearing others discuss his sect, he naturally wanted to listen more.

To his disappointment, the two showed no intention of continuing the topic and instead shifted to unrelated matters.

Yang Kai shook his head inwardly and lost interest.

After a short while the two finished eating. One of them, a broad-faced man, barked, “Innkeeper!”

His voice was loud enough to draw every eye, but upon seeing his appearance the guests averted their gaze, seeming reluctant to provoke him.

Thud, thud, thud…

Footsteps came from below, and an older waiter hurried up the stairs. He came to the two men with a beaming face, bowing and scraping, “Sirs, was the food satisfactory?”

“So-so.” The broad-faced man picked at his teeth and answered carelessly.

“Pardon, sirs.” The innkeeper bowed and said, “Next time — next time I will present a more delicious feast to ensure your satisfaction.”

“Hmph, you still have some discernment — I'll let it go today. But… the payment?” The broad-faced man eyed the innkeeper askance.

“I've brought it, sirs — shall we count it?” the innkeeper said, placing a package on the table.

The broad-faced man did not bother with courtesy and opened it.

A large bundle of upper-grade Saint Crystals came into view. The man swept his divine sense over them and immediately knew their quantity; his expression darkened as he snapped, “Only this much? Old thing, do you take me for nothing? Is this all you owe me this month?”

The innkeeper trembled with fear, wiping cold sweat from his brow and pleading, “Lord, please understand — business has been poor recently, so the amount is lacking. I beg a few days' grace and I will make it up.”

“A few days' grace?” The broad-faced man snorted. “If I give you grace, who gives grace to me? If this job goes unfinished, I'll be punished!”

Saying this, he slammed the table so hard it was shattered to splinters.

The innkeeper turned deathly pale and fell to his knees, crying, “Lord, have mercy! Give me only a few days and I will make it right — I beg your pardon!”

“Hmph. Don't claim I'm bullying you — I'll give you three days. Three days from now I'll return. If you still dawdle, I'll tear down this tavern and twist your neck!”

“Yes, yes — I won't disappoint you!” the innkeeper choked out.

“Let's go!” The man, impatient, rose, stuffed the bundle of Saint Crystals into his Spatial Ring, and strode out.

Only after they left did the innkeeper breathe a ragged sigh and begin clearing up the mess with a face full of grief.

The waiter came over to help.

Not long after they finished tidying, the innkeeper performed a deep, ritualistic bow to apologize to the other patrons, then sighed heavily as he appeared even older than before.
