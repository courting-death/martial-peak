## Chapter 641 — Small Xuan Realm

Time flowed, the sun and moon alternated, and before long a month had passed.

One day a month later, in the enormous stone chamber where Yang Kai lived, the delicate young girl Guan'er sat several hundred zhang away, listlessly watching the human youth Yang Kai, whose head was buried in the long table, eager for knowledge.

On the long table there had originally been several hundred volumes, but over the past month Yang Kai had essentially read them all; to his left were the books already examined, to his right those he had not yet had time to look at—only a few remained.

The precious knowledge contained in those volumes had been deeply impressed upon Yang Kai's mind.

Guan'er let out a soft breath, secretly astonished; ever since this human youth arrived a month ago he had behaved with surprising calmness—during that month he scarcely left the room and immersed himself in those books as if intoxicated.

The space beside them suddenly warped, a faint ripple of energy issuing forth, and Guan'er's face brightened as she immediately adopted an exceptionally respectful demeanor.

Very soon, from that distorted space a mature, dignified beauty gradually took shape—none other than Lady Li.

"My Lady!" Guan'er hurriedly kowtowed.

Lady Li nodded lightly, cast a glance at Yang Kai in the distance, smiled faintly, and asked, "How has he been behaving?"

"Very interesting..." Guan'er covered her small mouth, "He's completely different from the humans who've come here before."

"Oh? Tell me more." Lady Li's interest was piqued.

"He seems to have been studying the volumes left by alchemists and hasn't gone out at all; he shows no impatience, as if he's in his own home. Hee hee, My Lady, don't you think this brat might be a little foolish?"

Lady Li gazed at Yang Kai deeply, slowly shook her head, her brows faintly knitting, then her eyes suddenly brightened: "He's not foolish. Judging by his manner, he seems intent on the path of alchemy—saves me from a round of lecturing. Come, let's go see him; since he's performed well, it's time to tell him certain things."

"Yes!" Guan'er answered at once.

The two women, one tall and one short, strolled towards Yang Kai and soon arrived at his side.

Yang Kai remained indifferent, sitting in the only chair, his thoughts still immersed in the volumes before him.

Guan'er gave a light cough and called out, "Outsider!"

"Wait a moment!" Yang Kai replied lightly without lifting an eyelid.

Guan'er was taken aback and instantly displeased, scolding, "Lady Li has come to see you—aren't you going to pay your respects?"

Yang Kai drew in a breath, glanced at her, then lowered his eyes and continued to study the books before him, ignoring her.

Guan'er grew vexed and was about to berate him, but Lady Li raised a small hand, signaling her to be silent, and instead stood there smiling, waiting quietly.

Guan'er ground her teeth in annoyance, inwardly cursing that this outsider was putting on airs and had no idea of proper manners, and secretly vowed to make him pay later.

Time moved quickly. Lady Li and Guan'er waited beside Yang Kai for half a day before Yang Kai finally closed the last book on the table and drew a deep breath.

"Finished reading?" Lady Li asked softly for the first time.

Yang Kai nodded faintly.

"How do you feel?"

"I've gained something." Yang Kai answered.

Lady Li's lovely eyes brightened. "You truly have some foundation in alchemy."

Without an alchemist's foundation, it would be impossible to comprehend those volumes.

Yang Kai grinned, "You must have captured quite a few cultivators who possess Divine Sense Fire and imprisoned them here to train them into alchemists... Hmm, I have some idea of what you want me to do."

Over the past month Yang Kai had read every one of those volumes; they were the legacy left by predecessors—many were collected insights and experiences of alchemists, and some were records left by people who had suffered the same fate as he.

They had all been captured by the Coffin-Bearer and, under their master's support and cultivation, strove to become master alchemists; sadly, none met the requirements and ultimately their whereabouts became unknown.

A month was enough for Yang Kai to understand their intent and his situation, and it had steadied him considerably.

As long as these people had need of him, he would have no danger and might even benefit.

"Indeed. We have captured many cultivators with Divine Sense Fire and have been committed to training them into outstanding alchemists," Lady Li admitted frankly.

"Why? What problem do you have that only alchemists can solve?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "To concoct a Pill?"

Lady Li looked surprised, then nodded slightly. "Indeed, to refine a certain Pill. But that Pill cannot be made by just any alchemist; only an alchemist with Divine Sense Fire could possibly produce it, which is why you were brought here."

"Tell me about it; I also want to become an alchemist. If your conditions are agreeable, I don't mind helping you," Yang Kai said leisurely.

"How arrogant!" Guan'er curled her lips disdainfully. "Although cultivators with Divine Sense Fire are exceedingly rare, Senior Coffin-Servant has captured a dozen or so over the countless years—each one was exceptional. Why should you think you can accomplish what they could not?"

"That's my concern; you needn't worry. Besides, you want me to succeed, don't you?" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"Indeed, we hope you can succeed and lift the seal that has bound our line for so many years so we can go out and see the world." Lady Li nodded, her eyes shining with expectation. "To introduce ourselves: our ancestors were demon disciples who served the Great Demon God. Some unknown years ago, due to certain reasons, our ancestors were sealed by the Great Demon God in this Small Xuan Realm, forever unable to leave."

"The Great Demon God, and the Small Xuan Realm?" Yang Kai's eyelids tightened.

"The Great Demon God is the supreme existence of the demon race, the master of our ancestors," Lady Li explained with reverence. "As for the Small Xuan Realm, it is the pocket of space we currently occupy. It is said that in ancient times when powerful experts fought they would tear the fabric of space, producing such closed-off domains—these are Small Xuan Realms. You should have heard of such things."

"I've heard of them, only I didn't know they were called Small Xuan Realms," Yang Kai nodded.

In that case, the Inheritance Celestial Cave and that anomaly at Ghostly Underworld Mountain are also Small Xuan Realms.

Suddenly realizing something was amiss, Yang Kai smiled oddly, "If the Great Demon God was your ancestors' master, then why did he seal them here?"

Lady Li gave a wry smile and shook her head. "The records contain only fragments, not the full truth; countless years have passed and the reasons are no longer traceable. Our greatest wish now is to leave this Small Xuan Realm. But because of our physiques we cannot survive outside, so we require a Pill to remove the defects within our bodies. That is the Pill you need to refine."

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded and asked, "What about the Coffin-Bearer? He should be one of you, right? Why can he move about outside while carrying a Blood Coffin?"

Lady Li's expression darkened as she explained softly, "You must mean Senior Coffin-Servant. He is actually dead, but through special methods retains a measure of awareness and spends his years roaming outside, seeking cultivators with Divine Sense Fire for us. We do not even know what era he is from—he has always existed as far back as our longest memories go. The Blood Coffin he carries is what seals our Small Xuan Realm. You could say Senior Coffin-Servant bears the fate and lives of several thousand of our line."

"If someone were to seize and destroy the Blood Coffin he carries..." Yang Kai suddenly entertained a terrible thought.

"This place would collapse, and we would all be killed by the force of the void!" Lady Li explained in a low voice.

Yang Kai was stunned, chills running down his spine. "Your fate is not in your own hands at all."

"Nor is yours now," Lady Li smiled faintly. "So work hard to leave here as soon as possible. We hope you truly are different from the others and can fulfill our wish."

After a pause she asked, "By the way, what rank of alchemist are you now? What quality Pill can you refine?"

Yang Kai cleared his throat. "I can barely refine Earth-Grade quality."

Guan'er covered her mouth in surprise, and Lady Li also stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Hearing him speak so calmly, both women had assumed he was a highly skilled, practiced alchemist; now it was clear he was just beginning the alchemical path, and disappointment inevitably surfaced.

Yang Kai chuckled, "One of my teachers taught me: 'No Divine Roaming, no alchemy.' I only recently began studying it."

"How long until you can rise to Saint-Grade?" Guan'er asked in astonishment. "Without Saint-Grade, you simply cannot refine that Pill."

"Very soon," Yang Kai grinned with confidence.

"I hope you're right. You'd better achieve it within ten years—if you fail within ten years... you will die!" Lady Li's face turned solemn. "It's not that we want to kill you; as you've already felt, this place is saturated with potent demonic energy that is incompatible with human True Yuan. If you remain too long you'll be affected, your mind will cloud, and you'll become useless. Those previously captured by Senior Coffin-Servant all met that fate, and we had no choice but to slay them."

"Don't worry about that; even if I stayed here a hundred years, the demonic energy wouldn't affect me," Yang Kai sneered.

Not only would it not affect him, his Proud Bone Golden Body even rather enjoyed this kind of energy.

"You talk a big game..." Guan'er sneered disdainfully at Yang Kai. "You humans always like to boast; you are far less pragmatic than we demons!"
