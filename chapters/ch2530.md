## Chapter 2530 — Barbaric Wild Wine

This nameless city was a den of both dragons and snakes, full of swindlers and cheats at every turn. Although Yang Kai had just arrived, he was already used to such things and didn’t pay them much mind.

This man probably thought Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi were young and easy to fool, so he took the initiative to approach, hoping to make a quick fortune.

Yang Kai originally didn’t want to bother with such a person, but suddenly, a similar figure surfaced in his mind.

Back in Fenglin City, when he first met the Mortal Great Emperor, he’d also looked this disheveled…

Remembering Duan Hongchen’s situation, Yang Kai couldn’t help but worry, wondering how he was getting along with Wu Kuang now that they shared a body.

“Friend, are you going to give me an answer or not? If you don’t want it, I’ll find someone else!” The man saw Yang Kai seemingly lost in thought and couldn’t help but urge him.

Yang Kai glanced at him, gently urging his Emperor Yuan, which flashed and vanished in an instant.

The man’s expression changed, and he quickly retreated a few steps, exclaiming in shock, “So you’re an Emperor Realm master!”

He wasn’t weak himself, at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, so he could clearly sense Yang Kai’s Emperor Yuan. Only now did he realize he’d misjudged this unremarkable young man—he was not someone to provoke.

Terrified, he forced a smile and said, “Since you don’t need it, I’ll take my leave.”

What a joke—he only tried to scam Dao Origin Realm cultivators, never Emperors. He had no guts to mess with someone like Yang Kai, so he hurried to leave, lest he anger him and suffer the consequences.

“Wait!” Yang Kai suddenly called out.

The man broke out in a cold sweat and stammered, “Master, do you have any other instructions?”

Yang Kai asked, “Judging by your appearance, have you been here a long time?”

“To answer Master, I’ve lived here for over thirty years.”

“Thirty years!” Yang Kai raised his brows. “So you must know a lot about the Ancient Wilds?”

Perhaps Yang Kai’s easygoing manner put him at ease, as the man’s nerves gradually settled. He quickly replied, “Of course, I know it well.”

“I have some questions for you,” Yang Kai said calmly.

“About the Ancient Land?” The man was quick-witted and guessed immediately.

Yang Kai nodded. “Is there somewhere convenient to talk?”

The man grinned obsequiously. “If you don’t mind, Master, I can take you somewhere, but it’s a bit… expensive.”

“No problem. Lead the way!” Yang Kai waved his hand.

The man was overjoyed and hurried to lead the way.

Soon, the three of them entered a place that looked like a tavern. From the outside, it seemed crudely built, but inside, it was a different world. The interior was lavishly decorated, with thick beast pelts covering the floor—no telling what kind of demonic beast they came from. All around, fist-sized luminous pearls cast a soft glow, lighting the whole inn brightly.

A faint, exotic fragrance drifted through the air, refreshing anyone who breathed it in.

Seeing the environment, Yang Kai knew the owner must have some skill; otherwise, there was no way the place could be so luxurious.

As soon as the three entered, a man dressed as a waiter came out. Seeing the shifty-looking man, he waved him off, “Shoo, shoo! Pi San, you’re not welcome here. Get lost before you dirty the floor.”

Though just a greeter, this waiter was actually at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and he didn’t look very old.

This surprised Yang Kai. The tavern really was full of hidden talents. While a Third Stage Saint King was nothing to him, it was still overkill for a greeter.

The man called Pi San was furious, veins bulging on his forehead. He shouted, “Waiter, don’t look down on people! Today I’m bringing this master to eat. Bring out your best food and drink, and don’t worry about payment—we have plenty of Source Crystals!”

He strutted about, relying on Yang Kai’s authority, which looked quite ridiculous.

“Master?” Only then did the waiter glance at Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi, frowning slightly.

Zhang Ruoxi was about twenty, and no matter how talented, couldn’t be an Emperor. But Yang Kai’s aura was restrained, and he seemed strong.

Years of greeting guests had given the waiter sharp eyes. With one look, he guessed Yang Kai was likely at the Emperor Realm—otherwise, Pi San wouldn’t call him “Master.”

Since they were here to eat, he had no reason to stop them. He quickly stepped aside and respectfully said, “Please, come in.”

Pi San grinned obsequiously, leading the way. “Master, come this way. I’ll take you to a private room where we can talk.”

Yang Kai nodded and followed Pi San inside.

As they passed the waiter, he suddenly said, “Master, Pi San is a notorious swindler, especially with newcomers. Many have been tricked by him. Please be careful not to fall for his schemes.”

Yang Kai glanced at him and smiled. “Thanks for the warning. If he dares trick me, he won’t see tomorrow’s sun.”

The waiter smiled. “Master is wise!”

Pi San’s face turned pale at this, and he quickly said, “Don’t worry, Master. I only scam those I can handle. With someone as wise and powerful as you, I wouldn’t dare try anything. That’d be suicide.”

Yang Kai neither agreed nor disagreed, his mysterious demeanor making Pi San even more nervous.

Soon, under Pi San’s lead, the three entered a private room.

Knowing he didn’t smell great, Pi San sat far from Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi after they were seated, smiling, “Since it’s your first time here, Master, you must try the Barbaric Wild Wine.”

Yang Kai snorted, “Order whatever you want. Consider it payment for answering my questions.”

Pi San was overjoyed. “Thank you, Master!”

He was so excited he nearly drooled, slapped the table, and called the server, rattling off more than a dozen dish names in one breath, clearly very familiar with the menu.

Yang Kai listened in surprise. The dishes here were all made from demonic beast parts and rare spiritual herbs, and the ingredients were from Eleventh-Tier demonic beasts and Dao Origin-Grade spiritual herbs.

Whether or not they tasted good, such dishes were a great tonic for any cultivator. Eating them regularly would definitely boost one’s strength.

The server was a young maid. After Pi San finished ordering, she looked at Yang Kai and said, “Honored guest, this meal totals five hundred thirty thousand lower-level Source Crystals. Forgive my boldness, but could you please settle the bill first?”

She clearly knew Pi San couldn’t pay, so she looked straight at Yang Kai.

Pi San flew into a rage, slamming the table and glaring as he shouted, “What, you think we’re here to dine and dash? You’re barely grown, yet just like that waiter at the door, you look down at people! Is this how your elders taught you to treat guests? Anyone who walks through the door is a customer — is this how you receive them?”

The maid was so frightened her face went pale, and she quickly waved her hands. “No, no, that’s not it…”

Pi San seemed ready to scold her more, but Yang Kai snorted coldly, making him shrink his neck and shut up immediately.

Yang Kai took out a cloth bag from his spatial ring and handed it to the maid. “Count it.”

She swept it with her divine sense, confirmed the amount, and smiled. “Please wait a moment, honored guests. The food and wine will be ready soon.”

With that, she turned and left.

The tavern was very efficient. In no time, the table was filled with delicious food, and the private room was filled with a rich aroma that made everyone’s mouth water.

The dishes looked, smelled, and tasted excellent—truly remarkable.

Pi San picked up a wine jar, respectfully poured for Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi, and said, “This Barbaric Wild Wine is a local treasure. You must try it.”

Zhang Ruoxi frowned. “Hurry up and eat. My master has questions for you.”

She didn’t think much of Pi San, so she spoke bluntly.

Pi San said, “Miss, I’m not forcing you, but if you’re planning to enter the Ancient Land, you’d best have a cup of this Barbaric Wild Wine.”

“Why?” Zhang Ruoxi looked at him in confusion.

Pi San smiled. “All the ingredients for this wine come from the Ancient Land and carry a trace of its Primordial aura. Drinking it will help you adapt to the Primordial power, so you won’t be at a loss when you enter.”

“Primordial power!” Zhang Ruoxi still didn’t quite understand.

Yang Kai, however, looked thoughtful and nodded. “Ruoxi, drink more and feel the wonder of this Primordial power.”

Since Yang Kai said so, Zhang Ruoxi didn’t refuse. She nodded, “Yes!”

She took a sip, savoring it carefully. Soon, her brows furrowed in surprise, and she quickly circulated her Origin Qi, silently resisting something.

Pi San had expected this and smiled. “This Barbaric Wild Wine is strong and lingering. Even Emperor Realm experts can’t handle a whole jar at once. Miss, drink slowly and feel it carefully.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai also took a sip. He immediately sensed a strange power hidden in the wine, which spread through his flesh, meridians, and dantian, affecting the flow of his Emperor Yuan.

The power felt very familiar. Yang Kai’s brows rose as he realized—the so-called Primordial power was the same aura released by the Mountain and River Bell!
