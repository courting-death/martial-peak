## Chapter 2130 — Circumstances Have Changed

"No need to trouble yourself!" Yang Kai said, curling his lips.

Wen Zishan smiled, not at all annoyed. After thinking for a moment, he said, "Then... would you like this Lord to help you properly refine this Imperial Treasure? I see your compatibility with it is quite low; you can't even draw out a fraction of its power. You don't have much time left either. If this Lord lends a hand, I guarantee that once you enter Four Seasons Land you'll be able to wield a tenth of its power, making you invincible in the secret realm. How about it?"

He wore a sincere and persuasive expression, as if offering Yang Kai a tremendous benefit.

Yang Kai shook his head, looking at him with a teasing gaze. "Hall Master Wen, are you really so eager for me to make a request?"

Wen Zishan's mouth twitched at these words, and he muttered under his breath, "Damn... I've been seen through!"

Yang Kai burst into laughter. "As for that request, this junior will consider it carefully. Once I've decided, I'll come seek Hall Master Wen to make good on it!"

He understood very well that Wen Zishan was a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, and also the Hall Master of Qingyang Shrine. Although this man gave him a somewhat unreliable impression, such experts always kept their word.

He had promised that after Yang Kai defeated Xue Yi, Yang Kai could make a reasonable request, and he would surely fulfill it.

Yang Kai currently had nothing to ask for, so naturally he wouldn't bring it up. He'd save it for later; perhaps it would be of great help at a critical moment.

"You're far too cunning!" Wen Zishan said bitterly, but soon he showed a nonchalant expression and waved his hand. "Forget it, this is what you deserve. In seven days, come to Luoying Peak. Someone will lead you all out then."

"Yes!" Yang Kai nodded, cupping his fists and bowing. "Farewell, Hall Master Wen!"

Wen Zishan smiled faintly, his figure gradually fading. After a few breaths, he vanished completely.

After he left, Yang Kai frowned and glanced several times at the void on the other side, his face puzzled.

He kept feeling that someone was hiding over there, but he couldn't detect anything. If the other party were at the Emperor Realm, it would make sense.

Since the person didn't reveal themselves, they were probably just here to watch the excitement. Yang Kai naturally wouldn't go looking for trouble.

He turned and walked toward the ruined palace.

"Did that Yang brat... notice us?" Chen Qian stared at Yang Kai's back in surprise, speaking softly.

"He probably just suspects..." Gao Xueting said. "But even so, his perception is unusually sharp. This man... is quite interesting!"

"Sister Gao, do you think he might be from... there?"

Gao Xueting turned to glance at her.

Chen Qian said, "If he weren't from that place, how could he have such strength, and even carry an Imperial Treasure! He's only First Stage Dao Origin Realm."

Gao Xueting shook her head. "If he really came from there, we couldn't possibly not know. Still... this generation of rising stars is truly full of talent!"

Chen Qian nodded. "Indeed... Princess Lan Xun perfectly inherited the Radiant Moon Emperor's Moon Illusion Body, and I heard she advanced to Dao Origin Realm over a year ago. She'll surely go to Four Seasons Land this time. As for Tianwu Sacred Land, I hear they have a Yin-Yang Twin Body. Wuhua Hall's Zhuang Bufan may not have a special physique, but he's exceptionally gifted, and has treated fighting across realms as routine since he began cultivating. At a young age, he's already made a big name for himself, and now he's at the Third Stage Dao Origin Realm. The two Commerce Guilds mainly focus on business, but in recent years they've recruited many outstanding talents... Suddenly, it feels like the Southern Territory is already theirs. I feel old now."

Gao Xueting remained silent, clearly feeling the same way.

...

Yang Kai returned to his room and naturally focused on refining the Imperial Treasure.

Wen Zishan had made it clear: in seven days they were to gather at Luoying Peak, and the time left to him was truly scarce.

He pondered the insights left by the Qin Family ancestors while strengthening his connection with the Myriad Sword.

Wen Zishan hadn't been wrong. Right now, Yang Kai couldn't even draw out a fraction of the Myriad Sword's power. The fact that he could seriously injure Xue Yi in one move was mostly due to his own strength; only a small part came from the Imperial Treasure's might.

Time passed, and several days flew by.

On this day, Yang Kai was in seclusion, cultivating.

Suddenly, his expression changed and he opened his eyes.

At the same time, an unusual tidal force surged through the world—vast, mysterious, and impossible to fathom.

Listening closely, he could faintly hear strange noises in the distance.

Yang Kai's expression grew serious, and with a flicker, he appeared outside the hall.

The sky was dim, the earth shrouded in gloom, and a massive shadow covered the heavens, as if some enormous creature was flying overhead.

Yang Kai looked up and was instantly stunned.

In the sky, a gigantic white bird was slowly flying by. Its shape was ordinary, looking like a pigeon magnified countless times, but the pressure it radiated was as heavy as a mountain.

"What is that? A Divine Spirit?" Yang Kai wondered, uncertain.

And judging by the giant pigeon's flight path, it was heading straight for the main peak of the Qingyang Mountain Range.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Figures appeared from all directions, clearly drawn by this powerful force.

On the main peak, Wen Zishan's figure flashed and appeared mysteriously. He stared at the giant pigeon flying toward him, and for once, his usually carefree face showed a rare seriousness.

Soon, the giant pigeon flew above Wen Zishan.

A flash of light, and the giant pigeon instantly shrank to the size of a normal pigeon. The overwhelming pressure and energy fluctuations vanished in that moment.

The white pigeon didn't pause, flying straight at Wen Zishan. He neither blocked nor dodged, simply standing there.

When it was about a zhang away, the white pigeon suddenly exploded, turning into countless specks of light that enveloped Wen Zishan. The glow slowly seeped into his skin and gradually disappeared.

Swish, swish, swish...

The crowd that had followed the white pigeon appeared beside Wen Zishan. They were the Emperor Realm experts of Qingyang Shrine.

Qiu Ran frowned deeply, watching Wen Zishan's changing expression without saying a word.

Chen Qian and Gao Xueting stood side by side, both seeming to know something, quietly waiting.

One middle-aged man frowned and softly asked Gao Xueting, "Elder Gao, was that thing just now... a messenger from that Lord?"

Gao Xueting nodded. "It should be, though I've only heard of it, never seen it myself."

The middle-aged man's face tightened. "To even trouble that exalted Lord to send a message… there must be a great upheaval in the world."

Everyone remained silent, anxious. All present were Emperor Realm, and ordinary matters wouldn't worry them, but this was different. For Qingyang Shrine to receive a message from that Lord, it had to be something big.

Now, only Wen Zishan, who received the message, knew the truth.

So they all looked to Wen Zishan, wanting to know what had happened.

But from Wen Zishan's changing expression, they couldn't discern anything, growing more anxious yet helpless.

After a while, Wen Zishan finally let out a breath and murmured, "Such a thing!"

"Hall Master!" Qiu Ran was the first to lose his composure, stepping forward to speak, but Wen Zishan cut him off and explained, "It's a message from Lord Tianshu—this time, Four Seasons Land's circumstances have changed!"

"Tianshu... the Emperor!" The middle-aged man who spoke earlier couldn't help but exclaim, excited. "It's really Emperor Tianshu!"

Of the ten Great Emperors, aside from those who founded sects and presided over their headquarters, most were elusive, like the Mortal Emperor, who could take on countless forms and wander the world. That beggar shivering in the cold by the roadside might be the Mortal Emperor in disguise.

If someone gained his favor, great fortune would surely follow.

Emperor Tianshu was equally mysterious.

He possessed abilities no other Great Emperor could rival. Emperor Tianshu could perceive Heaven’s secrets, behold the past, and glimpse the future—among all the Great Emperors, his powers were the most unfathomable.

Though many in the world knew he lived in the Valley of Destiny, few knew its exact location. Even which territory of the Star Realm it was in remained a mystery.

"Four Seasons Land... why would Lord Tianshu get involved?" Qiu Ran looked puzzled.

Four Seasons Land was a famous secret realm in the Southern Territory, but it didn't concern the entire Star Realm. By Emperor Tianshu's nature, he shouldn't care about the opening of such a mid-tier secret realm.

"That's why circumstances have changed!" Wen Zishan frowned. "This time, the Four Seasons Land... is connected to the Shattered Star Sea!"

"What?" Qiu Ran exclaimed in shock.

"Shattered Star Sea?" Gao Xueting's face also changed.

The Shattered Star Sea was another top-secret place, and few knew its exact location. Only Emperor Realm experts were aware that the Shattered Star Sea flowed through the spatial cracks of the Star Realm, with no fixed position.

And the Shattered Star Sea was the burial place of the renowned Heaven Devouring Emperor.

In fact, it was the death of the Heaven Devouring Emperor that led to the creation of the Shattered Star Sea!

Rumor had it that the Shattered Star Sea contained the secrets to becoming an Emperor, as well as many mysteries and powers left behind by the Heaven Devouring Emperor.

Such a place was immensely attractive even to Emperor Realm experts.

Unfortunately, Emperor Realm cultivators couldn't enter the Shattered Star Sea. It seemed the Law Power there repelled Emperor Realm experts, allowing only Dao Origin Realm cultivators to enter.

Every time the Shattered Star Sea opened, the entire Star Realm would become lively.

All the great sects would send their disciples in, hoping to find the secrets of the Emperors and the opportunities left behind, yearning for earth-shaking achievements.

The Shattered Star Sea was a much more important secret realm than Four Seasons Land!
