## Chapter 819 — Go Meet Someone

The Nine Peaks’ barrier and formation were laid down and perfected over countless years by successive old Saint Lords of Nine Heavens Sacred Land. All of those old Saint Lords were Third Stage Saint Realm experts, so what they arranged was naturally no shoddy thing.

Apart from certain special methods used by the likes of Zhang Ao and Cao Guan, very few attacks could break through the barrier to strike inside.

Without breaking this barrier, there was simply no way to fight the people of Nine Heavens Sacred Land head‑on.

Realizing this, Cao Guan’s face twisted with unwillingness.

Hearing him, Yang Kai only chuckled, snapped his fingers in that direction, and looked utterly at ease.

No one knew what that gesture meant.

But in the next instant, screams erupted one after another around Cao Guan. Dozens of War Soul Hall elites collapsed where they stood and died on the spot; among them were even two or three Transcendent Realm experts.

A wave of terror spread out in a heartbeat. Everyone involuntarily edged a distance away from Cao Guan.

Even Cao Guan himself couldn’t help going cold all over.

No one knew what method Yang Kai had used to silently kill dozens of War Soul Hall elites in the blink of an eye.

With all eyes on him, he hadn’t used any Martial Skills or Secret Treasures, nor had he released his Divine Sense. It seemed as if that single gesture of his had been a death knell.

Such an unknown method filled people with dread, each fearing they might be the next to die.

“Whether I have the ability or not isn’t for you to decide,” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

He hadn’t originally wanted to use the Soul-Devouring Worms lurking outside, but if he kept fighting like this, it was getting exhausting.

True Yuan he had in abundance, but linking his mind to the entire Nine Peaks Grand Array consumed too much mental energy. He could only use such a means to cow them for a while.

The Soul-Devouring Worms could kill any cultivator below the Saint Realm; slaughtering dozens was naturally no problem.

Nor had Yang Kai released too many. The worms didn’t obey very well, and among the cultivators gathered here, not all of them were intent on being enemies with Nine Heavens Sacred Land. If he truly wiped them out in one net, it would be hard to wrap up.

Besides, he had spotted two women here—Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu.

If there were accidental injuries, it would be bad.

Panic continued to spread. After dozens of War Soul Hall elites fell, no one dared make a rash move. All stared at Yang Kai in shock, eyes flickering with complex emotions.

The power and methods Yang Kai displayed deeply shocked everyone, making them realize that even if they could take down Nine Heavens Sacred Land this time, the price might be unbearably heavy.

“Wu Jie, why have you been watching without acting?” Zhang Ao suddenly turned and growled toward a certain direction. There, Wu Jie of the Netherworld Sect stood quietly, with no intention of intervening from beginning to end, shrouded in a green aura as if he were an outsider.

Wu Jie let out a few low chuckles. “I’m only waiting for an opportunity.”

“And have you found it?” Zhang Ao demanded in a deep voice.

Wu Jie slowly shook his head.

“I’ll settle with you later!” Zhang Ao snorted, thoroughly displeased. From just now, it had been Poxuan Palace and War Soul Hall fighting Yang Kai. Though a few hot‑blooded experts had helped, most people seemed to be watching.

And Yang Kai’s attacks had been aimed squarely at the two forces’ directions; he had no intention of touching anyone else.

That made Zhang Ao realize there would likely be no chance to break Nine Heavens Sacred Land today. If this dragged on and people’s hearts scattered, Nine Heavens Sacred Land might even launch a counterattack.

Xu Hui wasn’t someone to be trifled with, either. Having dealt with him for so many years, Zhang Ao and he knew each other’s depths.

“I’ll let you enjoy your ease for a few more days. I’ll come sample your superior moves another time. Next time you won’t be so lucky.” Zhang Ao spoke coldly. With that, he waved his hand and led Poxuan Palace’s people into a swift retreat.

“Next time any of you dare come again, we won’t be so polite,” Yang Kai said with icy mockery.

“So arrogant…” A few li away, Ji Yan, who had watched the whole battle, couldn’t help sighing. “He really is young and headstrong.”

The Duao Alliance’s Alliance Master, Yun Cheng, chuckled. “Come. This no longer concerns us today. Let’s withdraw first.”

“Mm.” Ji Yan nodded and followed in Yun Cheng’s steps.

Standing at the edge of the barrier, Yang Kai quietly sent out his Divine Sense, searching for a figure within the crowd. A moment later, his Divine Sense reached out.

The young man who was withdrawing with the others changed expression, hastily masked it, and slipped away.

In short order, the crowd dispersed and the music ended, leaving only blood and corpses strewn across the ground.

Yang Kai let out a gentle breath and felt a trace of weariness.

The elders and protectors of the Sacred Land, however, looked as if they had won a grand victory. Each was high‑spirited, looking at Yang Kai with eyes full of excitement, worship, and respect.

“Saint Lord… May I address you thus now?” As Xu Hui spoke, he watched Yang Kai’s reaction. When he saw that Yang Kai didn’t deny it, he couldn’t help but feel gratified and laughed heartily. “The Saint Lord truly is no ordinary man. In just a few days you linked your spirit and vitality to the Nine Peaks. I am genuinely impressed.”

“Indeed, indeed…” The beautiful matron Yu Ying nodded repeatedly, her eyes sparkling. “I thought we would surely suffer a calamity today, but I never expected we could force them to retreat so easily.”

“Don’t get too optimistic,” Yang Kai frowned. “They underestimated the Sacred Land today and suffered for it. Next time won’t be so easy to handle.”

At that, everyone fell silent. Xu Hui said, “With you here, Saint Lord, relying on the Nine Peaks’ assistance alone should be enough to hold them off. Why—”

“I’m not that capable,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “You probably don’t know this yet, but the power of the Nine Peaks isn’t inexhaustible. I only understood this after I formed the link today.”

“Ah? What do you mean?” Xu Hui and the others were shocked.

“At most, I can use the level of power I used today one more time. Then the mysterious energy within the Nine Peaks will be drained dry. At that point, it won’t be able to amplify my attacks, and once the Nine Peaks’ power runs out, the barrier and formation will collapse on their own.” Yang Kai explained, voice grave.

Everyone immediately realized how serious the problem was.

Forcing Zhang Ao and the others back today had been entirely due to the Nine Peaks. Without that assistance, Yang Kai was still only a Second Stage Transcendent.

Even adding their six Saint Realm experts, how could they withstand so many people and forces?

“Still, after today’s battle, I think at least half of those they enticed here will leave. No one wants to be enemies with a force that might rise again.” Yang Kai analyzed quietly.

“Half is good enough. Those who still come next time will truly be enemies of our Sacred Land.”

“Right. Next time, we won’t hold back,” Yang Kai said with a cold laugh. In this fight, all of his attacks had been aimed only at War Soul Hall and Poxuan Palace. He hadn’t even targeted the Netherworld Sect that had held back.

He wanted to send a clear message: don’t be enemies with the Sacred Land and you won’t be attacked.

If they understood his message and still came, that could only mean they were determined to destroy the Sacred Land.

“How are the disciples’ arrangements?” Yang Kai asked.

“All set,” Xu Hui answered solemnly, then grew uneasy and hesitated. “Saint Lord, are we truly going to temporarily give up the Nine Peaks?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded. “I’ve already spoken with the Great Yao Lord. There’s no going back on it now… The Sacred Land will avoid the edge for the time being. Let the yao tangle with them. If people die, they’ll only blame the yao. Otherwise our Sacred Land will end up with far too many enemies.”

“Yes.” Xu Hui nodded bleakly.

No matter what, the Sacred Land wouldn’t have it easy this time. If they stayed and fought, even if they won, they would make countless enemies. In a time of internal and external strife, that would hinder the Sacred Land’s development. If they lost, the losses would be disastrous; they might even lose their foundation.

And judging by the other side’s strength and numbers, losing was quite likely.

In that case, better to withdraw for now, bide their time, and leave this mess for the yao to clean up.

Humans and yao don’t coexist. No one minds how many the yao kill.

“Saint Lord, I still want to ask—where is the place you said can house several thousand disciples?” Xu Hui gazed at Yang Kai hopefully.

“I’ll tell you once I’ve handled matters…” Yang Kai chuckled. “Mm. Go inform the disciples and prepare to evacuate. I’ll head out for a bit.”

“You’re going out now?” Xu Hui was startled but didn’t ask what Yang Kai was doing. He just said, “Have Elder Yu Ying and the others go with you.”

“No need. They’re pulling out now and won’t be back anytime soon—and I’m only going to meet someone, it’s not dangerous. That’s all.” As he spoke, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and vanished from everyone’s sight; even his Divine Sense couldn’t be sensed anymore.

Fleeting Heaven Shadow—the only movement technique among the Nine Heavens Divine Techniques.

Xu Hui and the others looked at each other and smiled wryly. None of them knew who Yang Kai was going out to meet at a time like this.

Dozens of li away, the many forces and cultivators who had attacked Nine Heavens Sacred Land slunk back, each face shrouded in gloom and worry.

Many were pondering whether they should be meddling in this muddy water at all.

Facing Nine Heavens Sacred Land, that colossus of old, so many forces only barely managed to contend with it together. If they failed this time and the Sacred Land turned the tables, what awaited them would surely be endless revenge.

And that was a burden these not‑so‑powerful forces could not bear. They might be wiped out in a single stroke.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan looked especially displeased.

In a tent, the two sat with Wu Jie. Without another word, they turned all their ire on Wu Jie and gave him a thorough tongue‑lashing—for just watching the show today and not lending a hand—making them lose face.

Wu Jie didn’t care. He only let out his weird chuckle, which made Zhang Ao and Cao Guan’s tempers flare all the more.
