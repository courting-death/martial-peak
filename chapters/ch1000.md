## Chapter 1000 — Why Is He a Little Angry?

Yue Xi of the Sword Alliance was a middle-aged beauty, full-figured with a supple waist and long, shapely legs; the pure white dress hugged her in all the right places, and atop her well-rounded bosom sat the Sword Alliance’s distinctive sword-shaped emblem, her graceful form radiating mature dignity.

The two sisters, He Zao and He Miao, led Yang Kai before her and respectfully called out.

Yue Xi still looked a little pale, her white robe stained in places with crimson. She gave a slight nod, cast a questioning glance at Yang Kai following behind them, and asked with some wariness, "Why did you bring someone from Purple Star here?"

She had never met Yang Kai before and naturally assumed he belonged to Purple Star.

"Master, he isn’t from Purple Star." He Miao approached, looped her arm through Yue Xi’s, and, pointing at Yang Kai, introduced him with a bright smile, "He’s the one who gave my sister and me those crystal stones and pills in the Chaos Abyss — his name is Yang Kai."

"Is it him?" Yue Xi’s fine brows rose in surprise.

When she had found He Zao and He Miao in the Chaos Abyss, the sisters had told her of their ordeal; she knew that if Yang Kai hadn’t provided them with some restorative supplies, they would have collapsed long ago.

Still, she remained somewhat suspicious about Yang Kai’s background.

A lowly martial artist at the First Stage of the Saint Realm—how could he have wandered into the Chaos Abyss for no reason? Did he even possess such ability?

Thinking this, Yue Xi kept a composed expression and parted her vermilion lips to say, "Young man, thank you for looking after my two disciples before."

"You’re too polite, senior." Yang Kai bowed slightly, "It was nothing."

"Hmm, you did help He Zao and He Miao. Fine, I’ll give you a thousand Saint Crystals as a token of thanks." Yue Xi spoke thus and gestured to one side. Immediately a martial brother stepped forward, sized Yang Kai up, and buzzed, "Friend, where’s your space ring?"

Yang Kai froze, shook his head and said, "I don’t have such a thing."

The martial brother looked awkwardly at Yue Xi — since Yang Kai had no space ring, even if she wished to hand over a thousand Saint Crystals, she couldn’t physically do so.

Yue Xi frowned and ordered, "Give him your space ring — it’s not that precious anyway."

"Yes." The man reluctantly nodded, the ring on his hand flashing. He withdrew his own belongings from the space ring and handed them to a companion for safekeeping. After a moment, he removed the space ring and presented it to Yang Kai, saying, "There are still a thousand Saint Crystals inside. Count them."

"I didn’t come for payment." Yang Kai’s expression turned odd.

He suddenly felt as if Yue Xi was eager to get rid of him, as though she feared he’d linger any longer.

He didn’t know why.

"Then what do you want?" Yue Xi’s brows knit; her face showed displeasure.

The man who had handed over the space ring sneered and said, "Friend, a thousand Saint Crystals is no small sum, and I gave an additional Secret Treasure. That should be enough, right?"

"I said I don’t want payment." Yang Kai frowned. He suddenly realized they suspected him of seeking reward for his help.

That made him uncomfortable.

“Master, it’s like this.” He Zao stepped forward and said, “He was placed under a restriction by that Lü Guichen, leaving him unable to use his strength, so he’s asking for your help to remove it.”

"His power is restricted?" Yue Xi stared at Yang Kai with surprise, ran a probe of divine sense over him to confirm, and said, "Let me take a look."

As she spoke she reached out and touched Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not resist; although her misunderstanding irritated him, removing the seal on his body was the priority.

So he obediently cooperated.

Yue Xi’s finger touched Yang Kai’s forehead, and a current of energy like a trickling stream flowed from her fingertip into his body.

For some reason, Yang Kai suddenly felt a strange sensation: wherever that energy flowed, it became exceedingly pleasant, and his spirit involuntarily relaxed.

The next instant his face changed as if struck by lightning; his body trembled and he staggered back several steps to pull away from Yue Xi’s touch, his gaze darkening as he looked at her.

That woman… had just silently slipped a thread of divine sense into his own power and pierced into his Sea of Consciousness.

If he hadn’t quickly closed off his Sea of Consciousness, whatever secrets lay within it would have been exposed right under her nose.

Within Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness there were the Six-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus, the Divine Sense Fire, and the World-Ending Demon Eye that had fused with him — any of these could be perfectly concealed in daily life, but once someone probed his Sea of Consciousness, he could no longer hide them.

Whatever Yue Xi’s motive, she had crossed Yang Kai’s bottom line.

So he immediately recoiled.

A hint of astonishment appeared on Yue Xi’s face; she had not expected Yang Kai’s senses to be so sharp that he could detect her move.

"Yang Kai, what’s wrong?" He Miao was shocked at the change in his expression and hurriedly asked.

"It’s nothing — your senior’s cultivation is too high; the energy she pushed into me was beyond what I can bear," Yang Kai replied casually, withholding the full truth because revealing it would gain him nothing.

Yue Xi paused, then smiled faintly, "My hand was too heavy just now; I startled you."

"Master, has the seal in his body been lifted?" He Zao asked with concern.

Yue Xi shook her head and said bitterly, "If it were before, I could have removed it, but earlier I was injured at a fundamental level by that mysterious elder; for now I cannot break the seal in his body."

He Zao and He Miao’s faces immediately fell with disappointment; when they looked at Yang Kai, both appeared apologetic.

"It’s nothing — if it can’t be removed, forget it." Yang Kai showed no disappointment. He took the space ring from the man beside Yue Xi, clasped his hands, and said, "In any case, thank you for your kindness and generous gift."

With that he turned and left.

"Yang Kai, don’t be impatient — after Master recovers a few days she’ll be able to help you." He Miao called out with innocent earnestness, receiving no reply; she pouted, "He looks a little angry."

"That youth is suspicious." The warrior beside Yue Xi watched Yang Kai’s retreating figure. "According to the two Junior Sisters, he should have been wandering in the Chaos Abyss, so why is he with people from Purple Star? If he can appear here, he must have been aboard Purple Star’s warship before. And he’s only a First Stage of the Saint Realm martial artist — why did Lü Guichen go to such lengths to seal his powers?"

"What do you mean?" He Zao looked at him.

That cultivator chuckled slyly. “I was just thinking—could it be that the two Junior Sisters have been deceived by him? Maybe he’s actually from Purple Star, only pretending to run into you by chance in the Chaos Abyss, just to pry information out of you. If I recall correctly, you said you happened to meet him twice, didn’t you?”

"So what of it?" He Zao’s brows tightened into a thin line.

"Nothing much — Junior Sister, don’t be angry. I’m just warning you; you’ve trained close to your Master and hardly gone out. The outside world is chaotic." He grinned as he spoke, sounding casual.

"Big sister, could he really be from Purple Star?" He Miao’s suspicion had been piqued by the senior brother’s words.

"Not likely." He Zao slowly shook her head. They had met Yang Kai twice and he had not tried to glean any important information from the sisters; at their second meeting he even gave them crystal stones and Spirit-Grade Pills without charge.

If he were truly from Purple Star, there would be no need for such actions — he could simply have reported them to Lü Guichen and the sisters would never have been able to wait for their master.

So she did not believe the senior brother’s speculation.

"Better to be cautious." Yue Xi spoke up.

"Master…" He Zao looked at Yue Xi with a strange expression, as if wanting to say something but stopping herself.

"What do you want to say?"

"Nothing, nothing. Master, you should rest first." He Zao swallowed the words at her lips.

She had wanted to ask whether her master truly could not remove Yang Kai’s seal, but she could not bring herself to voice it.

Watching Yang Kai’s lonely figure fade into the distance, He Zao felt a sourness in her heart.

Strictly speaking, Yang Kai had saved the two sisters’ lives; that was something a mere space ring and a thousand Saint Crystals could not atone for.

With a soft sigh, He Zao signaled her sister and the two quietly slipped away.

After the sisters had left, Yue Xi—who had been sitting cross-legged on the ground to recover—suddenly opened her eyes and instructed the man, "Wei Wu, keep an eye on that youth’s movements. Don’t let He Zao and He Miao have too frequent contact with him. I feel there’s something off about him."

Wei Wu’s eyes brightened and he promptly clasped hands to acknowledge the order.

Yue Xi’s beautiful eyes deepened as she murmured, "How strange…"

At the very moment a strand of divine sense pierced into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, she had felt a sudden dread. Because Yang Kai quickly closed his Sea of Consciousness, the feeling passed as quickly as it came, and Yue Xi did not notice it in great detail.

She did not know what secrets might be hidden within his Sea of Consciousness.

But now, after this, his origins were all the more puzzling; Yue Xi had to act carefully to prevent her two disciples from being deceived.

She knew her disciples’ temperaments best—kindhearted, not ones to stir up trouble, and always grateful for favors received.

That the youth had saved their lives meant they would undoubtedly want to repay him; if this matter were mishandled, it could become a trouble.

Yang Kai moved away from the Sword Alliance’s people and sat alone in a secluded spot.

He thought it best not to approach Yue Xi: the beauty clearly harbored doubts about his Sea of Consciousness, and her attitude toward him had never been particularly friendly.

The Purple Star people now dared not provoke trouble, so Yang Kai estimated he would be safe for the time being.

Only when his body and mind relaxed did he finally sense the richness of this continent’s Spiritual Qi; though he could not use his own power or circulate his profound arts at the moment, the ambient Spiritual Qi still flowed into him of its own accord, penetrating his skin and merging into his flesh and blood, leaving him thoroughly satiated.
