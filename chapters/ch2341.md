## Chapter 2341 — Capture Him and Boil

A mere Dao Origin Realm cultivator actually dared to boast so shamelessly, declaring before an Emperor Realm master that he was doomed. Had he lost his mind?

Shi Cangying, Ye Hen, and the others all wore strange expressions.

Only Hua Qingsi knew that Yang Kai was not joking. Although Yang Kai was not an Emperor Realm master, he absolutely possessed the strength to fight one. Moreover, his Incarnation alone would be enough to give Qiu Ze a headache. If she joined forces with Yang Kai, they might even be able to hold Qiu Ze to a standstill.

So, after Yang Kai appeared, Hua Qingsi’s heart finally settled. Although Yang Kai’s cultivation was a Stage lower than hers, Hua Qingsi was certain she was no match for him!

She had never met a man as dazzling as Yang Kai.

Wait… Hua Qingsi suddenly realized that Yang Kai’s cultivation didn’t seem to be a Stage lower than hers, but was now on par with her.

When did he advance to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm? Hua Qingsi was shocked. It hadn’t been long since he broke through to the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and yet he’d made another breakthrough in such a short time. How could cultivation be as effortless for him as eating or drinking?

Though her heart was shaken, she felt even more joy.

With Yang Kai’s strength increased, the situation before them was now much more favorable.

“Heh heh…” Qiu Ze suddenly chuckled. Although Yang Kai’s words weren’t loud, he heard them clearly. A playful smile appeared on his face as he looked at Yang Kai and said, “Boy, you really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. You actually want to take this Lord’s life?”

Luo Jin gritted his teeth and growled from the side, “Palace Master Qiu, this is the one who injured your son!”

“He is Yang Kai?” Qiu Ze’s face darkened. Even Mu Zheng of White Cloud Tower and Ruan Hongbo of Heavenly Extreme Hall glared at Yang Kai in anger. Mu Guan of White Cloud Tower and Ke Tian of Heavenly Extreme Hall had both been killed by Yang Kai. The reason these two had come to Chiyue Sect to stir up trouble was also because of Yang Kai. Now that their enemy was right before their eyes, their hatred was palpable.

“That’s right. It’s him!” Luo Jin replied hatefully.

The events at the City Lord’s mansion that day were the greatest humiliation of Luo Jin’s life, something he would never forget. Although Yang Kai had spared his life at the last moment, this grudge was like a bone stuck in his throat. He could not rest until it was avenged.

He dreamed of killing Yang Kai to wash away his shame.

After learning Yang Kai’s identity, the experts of all the Sects were filled with murderous intent. Their gazes at Yang Kai were as if looking at a dead man. But since Qiu Ze hadn’t acted, they dared not move recklessly.

“You really are Yang Kai?” Qiu Ze seemed to want confirmation, shouting at Yang Kai from where he stood.

Yang Kai wore a look of disdain and sneered, “And who do you think you are, to be worthy of asking this Young Master’s name?”

His expression was utterly arrogant, as if he didn’t put Qiu Ze in his eyes at all. Qiu Ze, however, remained calm and did not get angry. He nodded lightly and said, “Very good. This Lord heard that you refined a furnace of Supreme Mystic Pills in the Four Seasons Land?”

Yang Kai raised his brows and mused, “So that’s your real aim. You want the Supreme Mystic Pill? Sorry, it’s already gone.”

Qiu Ze said, “No matter. This Lord never expected to get the Supreme Mystic Pill from you, but I heard you once consumed one. If I capture you and boil you, I should be able to extract a trace of the pill’s medicinal effect.”

As soon as these words left his mouth, even Ruan Hongbo and the others on Qiu Ze’s side turned pale and stared at him in disbelief, as if they couldn’t believe he would say such a thing.

Boiling someone who had taken the Supreme Mystic Pill to obtain a trace of its medicinal effect—none of them had ever considered such a thing. But thinking about it, it did seem somewhat reasonable.

The Supreme Mystic Pill’s effects were powerful. After taking it, most of the medicinal power would remain in the flesh and meridians, slowly refined over time. So, the sooner one took the Supreme Mystic Pill, the better.

Back then, that woman from the Eight Directions Sect had only been at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm when she took the Supreme Mystic Pill. Although she was forced to take it by Luo Yuan, she was able to fully utilize its effects. As long as her aptitude wasn’t too poor and she worked hard in her cultivation, her chances of reaching the Emperor Realm in the future would be much higher than others.

Qiu Ze was already in the Emperor Realm, so he clearly didn’t need the Supreme Mystic Pill. He was probably doing this for Qiu Yu.

But just thinking about having to drink a pot of human broth to obtain the pill’s effects made Ruan Hongbo and the others turn pale, their stomachs churning. They even felt a bit of sympathy for Qiu Yu. Who knew how Qiu Yu would react if he learned the truth in the future?

“You want to boil this Young Master?” Yang Kai laughed mockingly and retorted, “You’re the one who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.”

“You’re quite arrogant, boy.” Qiu Ze’s eyes flashed coldly as he snorted, “But without the strength to back it up, such arrogance is nothing but childish and laughable.”

As he spoke, he suddenly stretched out a hand and struck fiercely toward Yang Kai.

Instantly, the sky churned with wind and clouds. A massive hand formed of energy slammed down, covering a vast area.

Qiu Ze clearly didn’t care about the lives of others, nor even whether Yang Kai lived or died. To him, it didn’t matter if Yang Kai survived, as long as he could take him back to boil.

The ultimate move appeared, and in an instant, the sky turned dark.

Ye Hen, Du Xian, and the others’ eyes nearly split with rage, their bodies trembling uncontrollably, but they could only watch helplessly, unable to help.

Suddenly, a fiery red light burst forth, scorching heat filling the air. A delicate, tiny figure shot up, charging straight at the giant energy hand.

In the blink of an eye, the two collided. Liu Yan let out a soft cry as she was slapped down, but under her impact, the energy hand instantly dissipated, and the gloomy sky cleared.

Whoosh, whoosh…

At the same time, a sound of something breaking through the air rang out. Before anyone could see what happened, a figure had already returned to the Formation Foundation platform.

It was Yang Kai, who had taken advantage of Liu Yan’s move to flash over to Ye Hen, Du Xian, and the others, bringing them back.

He was skilled in space power, and this sudden move caught everyone off guard. By the time Qiu Ze reacted, it was too late to stop him. Looking carefully, all the hostages had been rescued by Yang Kai.

Qiu Ze’s face immediately darkened, his brows tightly furrowed as he stared at Yang Kai and the little girl he had slapped into the ground.

Yang Kai was one thing—his Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivation was fast, but Qiu Ze didn’t take him seriously. What surprised him was that oddly dressed little girl, who had actually taken his blow head-on. He could hardly believe his eyes.

Previously, he hadn’t been able to sense Liu Yan’s cultivation, but in that instant, he clearly felt that she possessed peak Dao Origin Realm strength.

Not only Qiu Ze, but everyone present was stunned.

None of them expected that the one to meet Qiu Ze’s attack wouldn’t be Yang Kai, but a seven- or eight-year-old little girl. To take a direct blow from an Emperor Realm expert—how could she survive? She’d been slapped into the ground, leaving a small, person-shaped pit.

She was probably already smashed to pieces.

In an instant, everyone cast contemptuous looks at Yang Kai. Even enemies like Ruan Hongbo felt disdain for his actions, thinking he was truly heartless to send such a little girl to her death.

“That hurt!” A crisp child’s voice, brimming with boundless fury, came from the pit. The next moment, a tiny head popped out. Liu Yan’s face was full of anger, her little face dark as she leapt out of the pit and patted the dirt off herself.

“She’s not dead?” Luo Jin was dumbfounded. He hadn’t expected that this tiny thing, struck head-on by Qiu Ze, would survive.

Not only was she alive, she didn’t seem to have a single scratch on her.

What kind of monster was this?

Ye Qinghan, Hua Qingsi, and the others were equally dumbfounded, staring blankly at Liu Yan.

Suddenly, Hua Qingsi’s expression changed. She hesitantly asked, “Liu Yan?”

When Liu Yan had acted just now, Hua Qingsi sensed her aura. The three of them—she, Liu Yan, and Zhang Ruoxi—had always cultivated together in the Small Xuan Realm, so they were very familiar with each other. Now, looking again, this little girl’s manner and appearance were seventy or eighty percent similar to Liu Yan, just much younger.

She hadn’t paid much attention to the little girl before, since it was a life-and-death moment, but now that she realized this little one might be Liu Yan, Hua Qingsi could no longer suppress her shock.

But this… how could it be possible?

Liu Yan turned and gave Hua Qingsi a sweet smile, calling out in a crisp voice, “Sister Hua!”

It was Liu Yan! It was definitely Liu Yan!

Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes widened instantly as she stammered, “You… how did you become like this?”

Liu Yan timidly replied, “Master said he likes little girls best, the younger the better, so I…”

“Hm?” Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes narrowed as she glared angrily at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat, hurriedly wiping his brow as he said, “Don’t listen to her nonsense, that’s just ridiculous.”

Now even Chi Yue and Ye Qinghan were glaring at Yang Kai.

“Beast!”

“Shameless!”

“Scoundrel!”

The three women each spat out a word, every one a dagger to the heart. Yang Kai’s face turned green.

Hua Qingsi snorted coldly, “From now on, you must stay by my side. Never be alone with him. Sister Hua will protect you.”

“Thank you, Sister Hua!” Liu Yan beamed with a pure, innocent smile.

“Are you alright? Were you hurt just now?” Although Liu Yan seemed fine, Hua Qingsi couldn’t help but ask. She had fought Qiu Ze before and knew how formidable he was—even she wasn’t his match. Liu Yan taking a blow from him was naturally worrying.

“I’m perfectly fine.” Liu Yan smiled slightly, but there was no warmth in her eyes—only a bone-chilling coldness. As she spoke, she shot Qiu Ze a frosty glance.

Meeting her gaze, Qiu Ze’s heart skipped a beat, a deep sense of unease welling up inside him. He immediately stepped forward and shouted, “This reunion is touching, but it ends here. This Lord does not wish to start a massacre, so I’ll leave you with nine words…”

As he spoke, his voice turned cold, murderous intent surging like a tidal wave. His words were like a frigid wind from the Nine Nether Purgatory, making everyone shiver.

“Those who obey me prosper, those who defy — perish!”
