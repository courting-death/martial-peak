## Chapter 129 — Spoils of War

In light of such weaknesses, and with the experience just gained, the battle strategy was quickly determined.

One person would lure out the stone sculptures, while the others would take the opportunity to leave one or two behind, attacking with all their might to shatter them as quickly as possible.

A new problem soon arose.

Who would be responsible for drawing the snake out of its hole? This was a very practical issue, as the person tasked with luring out the stone sculptures would undoubtedly face great risks. With over a hundred stone sculptures chasing after them, a single misstep could cost them their life.

Everyone understood the gravity of this task, exchanging glances but remaining silent.

After a moment, Nie Yong cast a grim look at Yang Kai and spoke, “To attack the stone sculptures, we must leave someone with higher strength. Therefore, the one who draws the stone sculptures can be someone with lower strength. As long as the escape route is well chosen, even if they are a bit slower, they can evade the pursuing stone sculptures by circling around the stone pillars. I noticed that Junior Brother Yang has good speed; how about you take on the responsibility of drawing them away?”

Yang Kai grinned at him, “Sure!”

“Yang Kai…” Du Yishuang gently tugged at Yang Kai's sleeve. She had been terrified when chased by two stone sculptures earlier, and the scene was still fresh in her mind. Now, seeing Yang Kai voluntarily take on this task, she couldn’t help but feel it was unfair to him.

“It’s fine,” Yang Kai replied with a calm smile.

Lan Chudie looked at Yang Kai in surprise and asked seriously, “Are you sure you can remain unscathed while being pursued by those stone sculptures? If you’re not certain, don’t take the risk. We can take turns drawing them away. Dangerous tasks shouldn’t fall on one person alone.”

“I’m not completely confident, but I’d say I have about eighty percent assurance,” Yang Kai answered somewhat vaguely.

Although the previous scene was perilous, it was not Yang Kai’s maximum speed. The battle in the Jiuyin Valley that night had allowed him to explore some uses of his True Yang Primordial Qi. While it couldn’t be considered a true martial skill, it could significantly enhance his speed.

Compared to fighting the stone sculptures, he preferred to draw them away. The earlier battle had also made him realize that with his current strength, it was difficult to inflict effective damage on the stone sculptures. Using the Proud Bone Golden Body would certainly increase his power, but that was a trump card he couldn’t easily reveal.

“Since you insist, let’s give it a try. If it doesn’t work, we can switch,” Lan Chudie concluded decisively.

After discussing the plan, the five of them stealthily made their way back along the path they had come.

Halfway, Lan Chudie found a suitable battlefield and instructed everyone to pay attention to this location.

“Yang Kai, thank you for earlier!” Du Yishuang suddenly expressed her gratitude to Yang Kai, referring to how he had helped her in a moment of crisis.

“It was nothing. Don’t dwell on it,” Yang Kai replied with a light laugh.

“But I still have to thank you.”

When they reached the area where the stone sculptures had gathered, everyone looked up and found that the stone sculptures had indeed returned to their original positions. Yang Kai quietly surveyed the area where he had previously seen bloodstains and was startled to discover two corpses lying there.

He didn’t know which sect’s disciples they were, but it was a pity they had wandered in and failed to escape.

“Are we ready?” Lan Chudie asked nervously.

“Mm,” Yang Kai nodded.

Lan Chudie continued, “If you’re pursued, run this way. Nie Yong and I will leave the last stone sculpture behind, while Du Yishuang and Zuo An will wait for the right moment to strike. If the opportunity arises, leave the second stone sculpture as well; if not, don’t force it. Our primary goal is to ensure our own safety. After leaving the stone sculptures behind, immediately head to the location I mentioned earlier to fight. Also, Yang Kai, you must not approach that battlefield. Only after shaking them off completely can you return!”

Lan Chudie clearly laid out everyone’s tasks, her thoughts organized and the tasks straightforward. The others nodded in agreement.

“Let’s move! Yang Kai, be careful!” Lan Chudie encouraged, giving Yang Kai a reassuring glance.

Yang Kai dropped the bag containing the Yang Flame Stones onto the ground and strode towards the group of stone sculptures.

The others watched him anxiously, and under the temptation of martial skills, Nie Yong began to worry about Yang Kai. If Yang Kai failed and died, then according to what he had just said, the next person responsible for drawing them away would be him, as he had the lowest strength among the remaining four.

“Don’t be useless!” Nie Yong muttered softly.

As before, Yang Kai approached the group of stone sculptures. At this moment, the stone sculptures were still standing in place, but Yang Kai knew he had not yet stepped into their alert range.

Cautiously taking a few more steps forward, he was almost close enough to touch the stone sculptures.

Suddenly, Yang Kai halted. He realized this distance was sufficient; the stone sculptures slowly began to move, accompanied by a series of cracking sounds. Their movements shifted from slow to fast, and in the blink of an eye, they became rapid.

Without any hesitation, Yang Kai turned and ran, passing by the ambush positions of the others and signaling them before disappearing in a flash.

Boom! The ground shook as over a hundred stone sculptures chased after Yang Kai in a frenzy.

As the group of stone sculptures was about to rush past, the four ambushers sprang into action. Lan Chudie and Nie Yong teamed up, while Zuo An and Du Yishuang formed another pair, working together to block the last two stone sculptures. They fought while retreating, leading them towards the predetermined battlefield.

With the plan reaching this point, it could already be considered a success.

Any two people teaming up here would be enough to take down a single stone sculpture.

The only uncertainty was whether Yang Kai, who was responsible for drawing them away, could return safely.

What they didn’t know was that for Yang Kai, it was the easiest part. He only needed to run around the stone pillars, easily shaking off the stone sculptures. Although he didn’t shake off many at once, after several rounds, the number of stone sculptures following him decreased significantly.

After a stick of incense, only three stone sculptures remained behind Yang Kai.

With a quick thought, Yang Kai decided not to shake them off any further but instead slowed his pace, leading them towards the designated battlefield.

By now, the battle on the other side should have concluded.

Yang Kai’s prediction was correct; Lan Chudie and the others had indeed finished their battle. The four of them were sitting in meditation, resting and waiting for his return.

While they waited, the ground suddenly trembled again, and the booming sounds quickly approached.

The four of them opened their eyes in a hurry. Nie Yong’s expression changed dramatically as he cursed, “This useless fool actually led those stone sculptures here! Should we retreat first?”

In his mind, Yang Kai must have been unable to shake off the stone sculptures, which was why he had drawn them to this location.

Lan Chudie pondered for a moment before shaking her head. “Yang Kai shouldn’t be that reckless. Moreover, judging by the sound, it seems he isn’t being pursued by many stone sculptures—at most two or three!”

“Three!” Zuo An exclaimed, his eyes shining with excitement. “I have better hearing than most!”

“He did it on purpose!” Lan Chudie smiled slightly. “Get ready to take over!”

As she spoke, Yang Kai’s figure appeared in the distance. He signaled to the group and then rushed past them like a whirlwind.

Moments later, the three stone sculptures that had been closely pursuing him revealed themselves.

Using the same method as before, Lan Chudie and Nie Yong teamed up, while Zuo An and Du Yishuang worked together to intercept one stone sculpture each.

Once they finished their battle, Yang Kai returned with the last stone sculpture.

The five of them quickly dismantled it into rubble.

“Well done,” Lan Chudie smiled at Yang Kai. In her original plan, they would have only been able to leave behind two stone sculptures at most, but she hadn’t expected Yang Kai to control them so well, bringing back three instead.

This was well within their capacity to handle.

“Let’s see if there are any spoils,” Yang Kai said nonchalantly.

The others hurriedly began to search through the rubble. They had already checked the first two stone sculptures they had shattered, finding nothing, which had left them disappointed.

This time, however, luck was on their side. Among the three stone sculptures Yang Kai had brought back, Du Yishuang found a small stone man.

This small stone man looked similar to the previous one, with a comparable number of red threads inside. However, the distribution of the red threads was quite different, indicating it was likely a different martial skill.

Du Yishuang handed it to Lan Chudie.

“Not bad!” Lan Chudie nodded slightly. “It seems this item doesn’t exist in every stone sculpture. The first time we shattered two stone sculptures, we only obtained one; this time, we got it from five. There’s no pattern; it’s probably just luck.”

Nie Yong remarked, “There are nearly a hundred stone sculptures over there. If we can shatter them all, I believe we can at least obtain twenty small stone men!”

Twenty small stone men would mean twenty sets of martial skills! Each person present could get four sets!

Everyone’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

“Let’s recover first! Once we’re ready, we’ll come back!” Lan Chudie’s pretty face showed some excitement.

The others nodded and each found a stone pillar to jump onto, taking out the medicinal pills they carried to sit and recover.

All of them were in the Qi Movement Realm, so they naturally had some commonly used pills on hand. Compared to them, Yang Kai seemed quite shabby.

However, Yang Kai didn’t need any pills. While the four of them had expended considerable energy in the earlier battle, he had faced no issues at all.

Nie Yong had been trying to please Lan Chudie, even wanting to sit beside her while recovering, but this time Lan Chudie didn’t indulge him. She coldly scolded him a few times and pushed him away.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but secretly chuckle. A woman like Lan Chudie, confident, strong, and ambitious, was not someone someone like Nie Yong could tame.

To win Lan Chudie’s heart, one would need to be even more confident and assertive, and of course, possess strength and influence far beyond hers; only then would she be tempted.

To put it bluntly, this woman was rather realistic! Although she always appeared approachable, Yang Kai could see the pride and self-admiration hidden in her eyes. Her beauty would only be reserved for powerful men, and in her eyes, Nie Yong was nothing.

As the four of them were recovering, Yang Kai naturally couldn’t be an exception.

He walked back to where he had dropped his bag, retrieved the one filled with Yang Flame Stones, and then found a secluded spot to focus on absorbing the energy from the stones.

Half a day later, the bag contained only a little less than half of the Yang Flame Stones. Yang Kai estimated that the four of them had probably recovered enough and headed towards the designated battlefield.
