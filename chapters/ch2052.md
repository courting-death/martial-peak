## Chapter 2052 — Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup

After reflecting for a time, Yang Kai solemnly put the jade slip away.

He was easygoing by nature and knew that fretting over the Withered Soul Seal was pointless, so he simply stopped thinking about it.

He turned his gaze back to that little pot of medicinal soup.

According to the information left on the jade slip, this small pot of soup had been painstakingly brewed by Gongsun Mu over the latter half of his life; Yang Kai had no idea what ingredients had been used to concoct the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup or what wondrous effects it might possess.

But since this soup was meant as compensation for the Withered Soul Seal, it stood to reason that taking it would be beneficial.

Moreover, Gongsun Mu's grotto had existed for several thousand years, and it had been a long time since his death — in other words, this pot must have been brewing here for at least one to two thousand years!

This was thanks to a formation that drew on the power of the earth-fire to continuously simmer the brew; otherwise the pot would likely have become useless long ago.

Primordial Cauldron Mountain had always been desolate and had never attracted the attention of martial artists — this was likely intentional on Gongsun Mu's part. An Emperor Realm expert could, with little effort, seal off the mountain's Spiritual Qi and craft a disguise to make it seem barren.

The spreading clouds and the strange fragrance it emitted had drawn warriors here.

And those phenomena were clearly caused by this pot of medicinal soup.

When a heaven-defying genius or a heaven-and-earth treasure matured there would be anomalies in the heavens and earth; extremely high-grade secret treasures and even the successful refinement of Spiritual Pills could likewise trigger such phenomena!

The anomaly at Primordial Cauldron Mountain was evidently due to the successful brewing of this pot of soup.

Since it had successfully brewed, and because it would be of great benefit to him, Yang Kai naturally would not let it go.

He sat cross-legged before the small pot, released a few strands of power to cut off the earth-fire the formation was drawing, then reached out, lifted the little pot, and brought the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup up before him.

Under close inspection Yang Kai found the broth unbelievably viscous yet crystal clear, free of any impurity so that one could see the bottom at a glance. Multicolored bubbles rose continuously from the lower reaches of the soup — quite wondrous.

The rich aroma assailed his nose and left Yang Kai feeling refreshed and alert.

He found no words adequate to describe the scent; this exotic fragrance could not be compared even to the purest, most holy scent of a maiden's body. Yang Kai had never encountered such a lingering, unforgettable aroma.

Having advanced to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, Yang Kai had long since ceased indulging in carnal desires; with his strength and robust constitution he no longer needed to eat. Yet when that scent entered his nostrils he unexpectedly felt an urge stir within him, as if he had gone many days without food and was desperate enough to swallow the whole little pot.

Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai lifted the pot to his lips, opened his mouth, and gulped it down.

Strangely, although the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup appeared scalding hot, it didn't burn his mouth; instead it was a comfortable temperature and filled his mouth with fragrance, tasting more delicious than anything he had ever eaten.

Tilting his head back, he drained the lone bowl of the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup in a single gulp, not a drop remaining.

Moments later, Yang Kai emitted a loud, satisfied belch, and a five-colored radiance issued from his mouth.

Before he could even properly savor the aftertaste of the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup, his lower belly suddenly went searing hot. Currents of heat, as if solid, radiated from his abdomen and shot through his limbs and bones, setting his body alight with a maddening, prickling pain that was equal parts numbness and itch.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he quickly stuffed the little pot into his Spatial Ring, shut his eyes to gather his spirit, swallowed his breath, and quietly set his profound art to work.

Ten breaths after Yang Kai had taken the pot away from where it had been simmering, the entire Primordial Cauldron Mountain suddenly hummed and trembled; a thunderous roar deafened the ears, the ground shook, rocks tumbled, peaks tilted, and the mountain split into countless pieces and rapidly sank down.

Inside the mountain, within the innumerable identical stone chambers, the surviving warriors all changed color.

Just as they were bewildered and did not know what had happened, the transmission formations inside all the stone chambers were activated, and in an instant the living warriors disappeared from their places.

The next moment, some ten or so li outside the perimeter of Primordial Cauldron Mountain, figures mysteriously appeared, each wearing an expression of astonishment and doubt.

"Brother Lian, you were transmitted out too?" Zong Qing swept his eyes and immediately saw Lian Yuming frowning; he called out at once.

Hearing the call, Lian Yuming turned to look at Zong Qing and, seeing him present here as well, nodded in surprise. "Yes — it seems you were transmitted out too?"

"Indeed!" Zong Qing's face grew grave as he gazed toward the violently trembling Primordial Cauldron Mountain and asked suspiciously, "What on earth happened inside that has caused everyone to be transmitted out?"

Lian Yuming thought for a moment and asked, "Brother Zong, after you entered did you encounter a succession of stone chambers?"

"That's right — all manner of strange trials, seemingly related to pill-refinement. By the way, Brother Lian, you are skilled in pill-refinement; those trials should not have been difficult for you, right?"

Lian Yuming slowly shook his head. "I only cleared the fifth stone chamber myself and do not know what benefits await those who pass all the trials. From appearances, however, the owner of this grotto should be an alchemist."

Hearing this, Zong Qing considered and then nodded. "Brother Lian makes a good point. If that's the case, we can ask other disciples whether anyone obtained some benefit."

As they spoke, Zong Qing turned to look around and, upon discovering that only about half of his elite disciples remained, his face changed.

His gaze fell upon a figure not far off, and in surprise he said, "It's you?"

Kang Siran wore a helpless expression.

He had been transmitted out the moment Primordial Cauldron Mountain stirred and found himself caught among the Blazing Fire Hall disciples, so he had not dared act rashly for fear of misunderstandings. Now that Zong Qing had noticed him, he could only force a smile, bring his fists together in salute, and say, "Kang Siran, Shopkeeper of the Fenglin City's Spiritual Pill Shop, pays respects to the two deputy Hall Masters."

"Spiritual Pill Shop?" Lian Yuming's eyelids narrowed. "The Spiritual Pill Shop of the Ziyuan Commerce Guild?"

"Indeed." Kang Siran nodded and breathed a sigh of relief; at this moment revealing his identity was out of necessity — lacking in strength, he could only rely on the name of the Ziyuan Commerce Guild to intimidate others.

As expected, upon learning Kang Siran's origin Zong Qing and Lian Yuming exchanged a glance and reined in their hostility. Zong Qing said, "I am familiar with the Spiritual Pill Shop; so you are Shopkeeper Kang — my apologies for earlier."

"Deputy Hall Master Zong, you are too polite," Kang Siran replied calmly.

"Shopkeeper Kang, do you know what happened inside Primordial Cauldron Mountain?" Zong Qing asked in a low voice.

Kang Siran shook his head. "I am at a loss as well; I do not know."

"I recall you had a companion with you before — where is that person now?" Lian Yuming asked thoughtfully.

At these words Kang Siran's face darkened. He glanced in the direction of Primordial Cauldron Mountain and sighed, "Since Brother Yang did not appear here, he likely met with some misfortune inside. I see your hall has lost many disciples; the trials within Primordial Cauldron Mountain are not simple."

He truly believed Yang Kai to have perished within Primordial Cauldron Mountain; after all, two Dao Origin Realm experts had been transmitted out, and one could imagine how those not transmitted out fared.

For a time Kang Siran felt sorrow: on the one hand he had failed to obtain the Dao Origin Pill he sought within the mountain; on the other hand he mourned Yang Kai's apparent fall.

Zong Qing and Lian Yuming exchanged a glance and slightly nodded.

They had seen no falseness in Kang Siran's demeanor and no longer wished to argue with him. Zong Qing said, "In that case, Shopkeeper Kang, accept my condolences and return home. After all, Primordial Cauldron Mountain falls within the influence of our Blazing Fire Hall; we will continue to search."

Kang Siran heard the obvious eviction and could not pretend otherwise; after a long sigh he saluted Zong Qing and Lian Yuming, then turned and flew off in the direction of Fenglin City.

After a short while, accompanied by earth-shattering noise, the entire Primordial Cauldron Mountain collapsed completely.

When all settled, Zong Qing and Lian Yuming led the remaining Blazing Fire Hall disciples to search the ruins of Primordial Cauldron Mountain; sadly they searched for two full months, nearly combing through the entire collapsed mountain, yet still found nothing.

They did, however, find the corpses of several disciples who had died tragically.

Two months later, the people of Blazing Fire Hall had no choice but to withdraw from the area.

...

Deep beneath the earth, an unfathomable number of zhang down, Yang Kai's howls—like those of a wounded beast—echoed through the cavern; anyone who heard them would likely flee at once.

The medicinal force of the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup was relentless; once swallowed it transformed into streams of pure power that assaulted Yang Kai's flesh and bones.

After the medicinal force invaded his meridians and flesh, they were continually made more resilient and powerful: his meridians widened and his flesh was remolded. Yang Kai's whole body trembled violently — every inch of flesh, every piece of skin, even his internal organs and bones — a prickling numbness spread through him, as if countless ants devoured him or he suffered the world's most excruciating torture!

The skin on his body cracked bit by bit, and golden blood flowed from within, gradually congealing into clots.

Outside those clots, newly flowing golden blood covered them once more.

Gradually Yang Kai seemed to be wrapped in a cocoon of golden blood; from the outside his figure could not be seen, and only the powerful sound of his heartbeat could be heard, pounding like war drums.

No one knew how long this lasted — it felt like countless years and yet like a single instant.

As time passed, the howls coming from within the blood cocoon gradually weakened and eventually ceased, as if he had grown accustomed to such agonizing transformation.
