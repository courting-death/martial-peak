## Chapter 1482 — Star Refining Technique

Half a month later, the gates of Tianyi Palace thundered open and Yang Kai stepped out, his expression calm.

After half a month of study, he had finally figured out what secret the stone tablet contained.

The Star Refining Technique! This was neither a cultivation method nor a martial skill, but a secret art that taught a warrior how to refine the Stellar Origin!

When he realized it, Yang Kai was startled—he had not expected the stone tablet to record something so incredible.

Refining a Stellar Origin was an extremely arduous task; only Void King Realm experts were qualified to attempt it, and once one refined the Stellar Origin of a cultivation star, that Void King Realm expert became its dominator—he would become the Star Lord of that cultivation star!

Yang Kai had already learned of the might of Star Lords when he first entered the Star Domain: the domain was boundless and vast, yet those who could become Star Lords remained exceedingly few, because to do so not only required peerless cultivation, it also carried tremendous risk.

The Stellar Origin was the essence of a cultivation star; attempting to refine it was inevitably a feat of risk and reward. Success granted the refiner unimaginable benefits; failure meant annihilation of both body and soul.

Throughout history countless experts had sought to conquer cultivation stars and refine their Stellar Origins; these experts were all illustrious, geniuses among geniuses, the strongest of the strong.

But those who succeeded in refining a Stellar Origin and became Star Lords remained vanishingly rare!

Who knew how many geniuses had fallen in the process of conquering cultivation stars.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild, which Yang Kai was familiar with, was exactly such a case: the guild controlled seven or eight cultivation stars and had over a dozen Void King Realm experts, yet there was only a single Star Lord among them!

No one else dared attempt to refine a Stellar Origin.

After all, it was dancing on the tip of a blade: success brought glory and the Star Domain's reverence, but a single mistake led to eternal ruin—what Void King Realm expert would risk his life lightly?

No wonder Xue Yue said the stone tablet was useless for the Origin Returning Realm and only useful to Void King Realm cultivators—the reason lay here.

As a major force in the Star Domain with a Star Lord to hold the line, the Hengluo Commerce Guild naturally had methods for refining Stellar Origins, but what they possessed paled by countless orders compared to the Star Refining Technique recorded on the stone tablet.

The Star Refining Technique could be called the highest-grade secret art, the most perfect method for refining a Stellar Origin.

And Xue Yue's trip to the Imperial Garden was for the Star Refining Technique; the Hengluo Commerce Guild's leader Ai Ou had been stuck at the second Stage of the Void King Realm for years, unable to advance, but if he could refine a Stellar Origin he could break through to the supreme peak of the Third Stage.

Somehow news had reached them that the Imperial Garden held an extraordinarily powerful refining secret, so Xue Yue personally led a contingent of elites to storm it; otherwise, given the Hengluo Commerce Guild's resources, why would Xue Yue risk her life?

But when the Star Refining Technique surfaced, she missed it.

Yang Kai did not recognize the three ancient characters on the stone tablet, but Xue Yue did, which explained her urgency at the time.

The function of the Star Refining Technique was still too distant for Yang Kai; regardless of his insufficient cultivation, even if he were qualified he would not rashly attempt to refine a Stellar Origin without absolute certainty.

So after studying it for a while, he put it away.

Outside Tianyi Palace, Yang Kai had only taken a few steps when he met several Lingxiao Sect disciples, who, upon seeing him, bowed hurriedly and said, "Hail, Sect Master!"

"Mm. Is everything in the sect well?" Yang Kai asked casually.

"Sect Master, since your seclusion there has been no change in the sect; disciples have been diligently cultivating. Only the Great Elder has returned from the Sixth Layer."

"Oh? She has returned?" Yang Kai was somewhat surprised. But thinking it over there was nothing strange—Yang Yan was still in slumber and would not truly awaken for at least ten years; keeping her there served no purpose. Naturally she would return to the Lingxiao Sect.

After all, she had been entrusted by Yang Yan to fully assist Yang Kai; how could she assist while remaining at the Sixth Layer? It would be inconvenient for everyone to interact.

"That is for the best!" Yang Kai nodded slightly, then instructed, "Have Huang Juan bring Lin Yun'er to the Great Elder's residence to see me."

"Yes!" The disciples did not know why Yang Kai wished to see Huang Juan and Lin Yun'er, but did not ask and went at once.

The Hundred Flowers Residence, the former dwelling of Yang Yan and Ye Xijun.

Although the flowers still bloomed in competition, the entire residence now held only Ye Xijun. When Yang Kai arrived he found her resting in the stone pavilion, seemingly lost in thought and not even noticing his arrival.

Only when Yang Kai cleared his throat did Ye Xijun snap awake, look up and say lightly, "So the Sect Master has arrived. I greet the Sect Master."

With those words she rose gracefully.

"No need for ceremony." Yang Kai waved, sat opposite her, poured himself a cup of fragrant tea and sipped, then asked after a moment, "Is Yang Yan all right?"

"My Lord is unharmed; she will continue to sleep for a time, Sect Master need not worry."

"That's good." Yang Kai nodded slightly, then suddenly asked, "What does the Great Elder intend to do going forward?"

Ye Xijun looked at him suspiciously, smoothed her hair and asked, "Sect Master, in what respect do you mean?"

"Great Elder, why pretend ignorance? You stay here only because of the Great Emperor; I do not know what reason makes you so attached to her, but are you really going to wait here until she awakens?"

"Indeed," Ye Xijun nodded lightly. "Is there a problem?"

"No, not a problem," Yang Kai smiled slightly. "It's just that the Great Elder would willingly let the years slip by—don't you want to make further progress in the Origin Returning Realm?"

"Further progress?" Ye Xijun's beautiful eyes narrowed and flashed strangely. "If the Sect Master has something to say, just say it—why play riddles with your subordinate?"

"You're a senior, stop calling yourself a subordinate; it makes me uncomfortable," Yang Kai's mouth twitched. "Well, it's like this. The Lingxiao Sect needn't fear invasion; defenses are ironclad, and as long as disciples don't go out they won't be harmed, and supplies for cultivation aren't lacking, so I want to leave here."

"Leave here?" Ye Xijun frowned slightly, not understanding what Yang Kai meant.

"Set off on a long voyage—leave Dark Star!" Yang Kai said, staring at her.

Ye Xijun could not help but be moved. "You mean the Sect Master intends to..."

"I'm just asking whether you want to leave with me!" Yang Kai grinned. "You should already be at the limit of the Origin Returning Realm, right? The reason you haven't advanced is likely the suppression of the local laws. If you break free of that constraint, with your talent and strength you have a very good chance to ascend to the Void King Realm. And now we have the means to do that. What do you think?"

"Leave..." Expectation filled Ye Xijun's eyes, but it quickly calmed. She looked at Yang Kai and asked, "The Sect Master will return, won't he?"

"Of course I'll return," Yang Kai nodded. "To tell you the truth, I'm only leaving to find a few people; once I've found them I'll come back. The Star Domain is vast, but finding a place to settle is not easy. I certainly will not abandon the Lingxiao Sect."

"That's for the best!" Ye Xijun relaxed. "Although the Sect Master's intentions are kind, please forgive your subordinate for daring to decline."

“Your reason!” Yang Kai looked at her with a faint smile.

"The Lord is still asleep; I cannot leave. Moreover, if the Sect Master and I leave simultaneously, if anything were to happen in the sect there would be no one to take charge."

"Of course!" Yang Kai nodded slightly, as if he had expected her reply.

Ye Xijun's eyes flicked, and she exclaimed in surprise, "Sect Master actually only wanted to inform me of this matter, not truly ask me to accompany you, right?"

“Heh heh…” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “The choice is yours—whether you go or not is up to you. I never said anything. However…”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted, turning solemn. “Still, thank you.”

For resisting the temptation to ascend to the Void King Realm and still remaining at the Lingxiao Sect to guard its gate for Yang Kai, Ye Xijun merited a sincere thanks.

Both understood each other, so Ye Xijun did not deny it—she merely nodded lightly.

Suddenly she looked up and asked softly, "Were those two summoned by the Sect Master?"

Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense to probe, then nodded and said, "Yes."

The arrivals were, of course, Huang Juan and Lin Yun'er; the little girl was led by Huang Juan, strolling over, but upon seeing such a large expanse of gorgeous flowers Lin Yun'er, like a wild horse, broke free and dashed into the flowerbeds.

Huang Juan was shocked and hurriedly ran to catch Lin Yun'er, dragging her back to the stone pavilion.

Lin Yun'er scowled in displeasure, pouting fiercely.

“Greetings, Sect Master. Greetings, Great Elder.” Huang Juan offered her salute while quietly studying Ye Xijun. Having been in the Lingxiao Sect for some time, she naturally knew of the sect’s Great Elder—renowned for her unmatched strength—but had never been fortunate enough to meet her. Now, summoned by Yang Kai, she finally had the chance to witness Ye Xijun’s grace in person.

"Sit!" Yang Kai gestured, then waved at Lin Yun'er.

The little girl rolled her eyes, buried herself in Huang Juan's embrace, and watched Yang Kai warily from the corner of her eye, leaving him speechless.

"Are you settled in comfortably?" Yang Kai turned to Huang Juan and asked.

"Thanks to the Sect Master, Lin Yun'er and I are well here."

"Mm, if you need anything ask Wu Yi; she'll handle everything. You're not outsiders here, so don't be shy."

"Thank you for your great kindness, Sect Master." Huang Juan said, visibly moved.

"By the way, this is an Origin Condensing Pill; take it and go into seclusion for a while—you should be able to advance to the Origin Returning Realm. When you break through, remember to go to the Ascension Dragon Hall; there you'll find the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense and the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, both of which can help dispel inner demons and aid your comprehension of the Martial Dao, greatly increasing the chance of a breakthrough."
