## Chapter 285 â€” Flowers Falling Like Rain

This group of people was ordered to capture Xiao Fusheng. Initially, only two of them came, full of vigor and determination.

As soon as they revealed themselves on Hidden Cloud Peak, they were directly killed by Meng Wuya.

After the deaths of those two experts from the Divine Roaming Realm, the remaining six learned that there were powerful experts stationed on Hidden Cloud Peak, which prompted them to come together. However, they still found no advantage. Even when they attacked in unison, they had to avoid the sharpness of Meng Wuya, who, despite being only at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, was able to block them all.

The martial skills displayed by Shopkeeper Meng were immensely destructive, employing techniques that were unheard of and unseen. The six grew increasingly alarmed as they fought, realizing they had kicked a steel plate.

Where did this old fellow spring from? The six were baffled. Wasn't it said that there was only Xiao Fusheng at the Divine Roaming Realm on Hidden Cloud Peak?

At the peak, Xiao Fusheng stood with a solemn expression, quietly observing the battle in the sky.

He was indeed at the Divine Roaming Realm, but he had devoted his life to alchemy and was not skilled in combat. The martial skills he had practiced were hardly impressive and could not help in this situation.

The two dignified beauties stood behind him, and further back were Dong Qingyan and Xia Ningshang. The expressions of the four women were tinged with a faint tension, unlike Elder Xiao, who remained calm and unperturbed.

"The Young Master has returned!" Suddenly, the Earth Demon exclaimed in surprise, and in the next moment, Yang Kai appeared at the top of Hidden Cloud Peak.

The Soul-Breaking Spike flew directly over, and Yang Kai reached out to receive it, transforming it into a black aura that vanished into his body.

Xiao Fusheng glanced over here but said nothing. Dong Qingyan quickly waved at Yang Kai, urging him to come over.

"What happened?" Yang Kai swiftly approached the group and asked softly.

"A day ago, the Cangyun Evil Land suddenly launched a large-scale attack on Yao Wang Valley, coming in fierce waves. They had long plotted this, and the experts from various forces stationed in the valley town were either dead or injured, allowing them to charge straight in. They breached Yao Wang Valley, and countless disciples from the twelve main peaks were captured. Additionally, the alchemists who came here to participate in the alchemy conference were also caught in the disaster..."

Xia Ningshang quietly recounted the events of that day and the information she had gathered.

Through her narration, Yang Kai understood much of what had transpired.

Cangyun Evil Land, the largest gathering place for evil in the world, was where all evil martial artists resided, occupying a vast area in the southwest of the Great Han Dynasty.

The entire southwest was the territory of Cangyun Evil Land.

Within Cangyun Evil Land, there were countless experts, and its power was not inferior to any of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, making it a formidable force.

Months prior, Cangyun Evil Land had been plotting this operation, capturing the direct descendants of various forces. Dong Qingyan had also been attacked outside Yao Wang Valley by Cangyun Evil Land.

They deliberately chose to strike during the alchemy conference, using the captured direct descendants as a shield to intimidate many forces in the valley town, preventing them from taking rash actions.

This led to a complete rout for Yao Wang Valley.

The purpose of their operation was not to annihilate Yao Wang Valley but to capture alchemists from across the world, whether they were disciples of Yao Wang Valley or outsiders attending the alchemy conference, capturing as many as possible.

They even set their sights on the relic of Dan Sheng, but the relic was too massive, and the experts from Yao Wang Valley at the Divine Roaming Realm fought desperately to block them, preventing their success. During the fierce battle, the relic was accidentally shattered.

Cangyun Evil Land employed every despicable means possible, leaving Yao Wang Valley unable to defend itself.

Here on Hidden Cloud Peak, if it weren't for Meng Wuya coincidentally visiting, Xiao Fusheng would likely have been captured long ago.

Soon, Yang Kai grasped the situation at hand.

He was secretly astonished by the audacity of Cangyun Evil Land and speculated about their true intentions in capturing so many alchemists.

The battle in the sky remained intensely fierce, with Meng Wuya holding his ground against six opponents.

"Form a formation!" an elderly man with a head full of black hair shouted angrily.

Upon hearing this, the six suddenly began to move in unison, setting up a mysterious formation. Their techniques combined, and Meng Wuya let out a muffled grunt, his face slightly pale.

Just as he was adjusting his aura, one of the six, an expert at the fifth level of the Divine Roaming Realm, suddenly leaped out of the battle circle and turned to fly towards Hidden Cloud Peak.

The remaining five launched a fierce attack, attempting to disrupt Meng Wuya.

"You dare!" Meng Wuya roared, a massive handprint soaring through the air, shaking the five and causing their bodies to falter. Seizing the opportunity, he aimed a palm at the one flying towards Hidden Cloud Peak.

The withered tree holy hand! Upper-Level martial skill!

The formless palm wind surged in an instant. The Cangyun Evil Land expert sensed the danger and hurriedly sidestepped.

The residual force of the palm wind swept across one of his arms, instantly numbing it. Looking at it, the entire arm resembled a dying old tree, rapidly shriveling.

The man's expression turned horrified as he hurriedly circulated his energy to resist.

Fortunately, he was only swept by the residual force, so he managed to hold on. Seeing his withered arm slowly regain vitality, he couldn't help but feel relieved.

With a strange laugh, the man's speed suddenly increased, like an eagle spreading its wings, diving down.

Yang Kai and the others felt a great threat, and everyone's True Essence surged wildly, secretly on guard.

At the peak, there was only Xiao Fusheng at the Divine Roaming Realm, and he was not a combat-capable expert. Even if the intruder was only at the fifth level of the Divine Roaming Realm, he could easily kill them all!

The overwhelming evil energy surged towards them, and the man grinned sinisterly, saying, "Xiao Fusheng, if you don't want to die, don't resist! I am here to invite you to the holy land as a guest, not to take your life!"

Elder Xiao's expression remained unchanged, unafraid.

The man took a moment to glance at Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan, then at Dong Qingyan and Xia Ningshang, licking his lips with a sinister smile, "So many beautiful women to feast my eyes upon... What a pity, I have important matters today, I will come to indulge you another day!"

As he spoke, he reached out a large hand, aiming to grab Xiao Fusheng.

Elder Xiao snorted coldly and raised his hand to unleash a large handprint.

The man laughed coldly, snapping his fingers to shatter Xiao Fusheng's martial skill, and without losing momentum, his hand quickly landed on Xiao Fusheng's shoulder.

Drawing in breath, he was about to leap into the air.

At that moment, Yang Kai, Xia Ningshang, and Dong Qingyan all struck together!

Though they were merely three young martial artists, the martial skills unleashed in full force made the expert's expression change slightly, especially Yang Kai's attack, whose True Essence was exceptionally pure and powerful. If it landed, it would surely be painful.

Hastily retracting his hand, he easily deflected the three's attacks and shouted sternly, "Get lost, I have no time to play with you!"

Before his voice fell, two delicate hands suddenly met him.

The energies of heaven and earth became chaotic, and a fragrant floral scent lingered in the space. Various petals flickered in mid-air, as if a rain of flowers was falling from the sky, creating a stunning scene.

Yang Kai stared in astonishment at everything, and Xia Ningshang and Dong Qingyan were equally shocked.

In the flower rain, Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan moved gracefully, flanking the Cangyun Evil Land expert from left and right. Their movements were light and ethereal, their enchanting figures dancing amid the falling petals.

"You..." The martial artist from Cangyun Evil Land looked horrified. Unintentionally inhaling some of the floral scent, his body suddenly softened, and he cried out, "You actually possess such skills!"

"Hmph!" Xiao Fusheng coldly snorted, "Since you've come, don't think of leaving."

"Trapped!" The man cried out in despair. Whether it was Aunt Xiang or Aunt Lan, their displayed strength was not inferior to his. With the two working together and Xiao Fusheng watching closely, he had no chance to escape.

The two beauties remained silent, their expressions cold.

Aunt Xiang extended a delicate hand, elegantly plucking a petal that floated down from the air, and flicked it away.

With a soft sound, the feather-light petal pierced through the man's shoulder, causing him to scream in pain.

Aunt Lan's hands transformed as her voluptuous figure danced without rest. The petals suddenly fluttered like butterflies, wrapping around the enemy.

Continuous cries of agony echoed, and when the flower rain dissipated, the man was left battered and torn, blood flowing freely.

The three young people exchanged glances, all with expressions of shock and disbelief.

Especially Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan, who had spent more time with Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan than with Xia Ningshang, still had not discovered any traces of martial artists in them.

The outside world also spread rumors that aside from Xiao Fusheng, there were only two inconspicuous maids who had served him for over twenty years. Many people didn't even know their names.

Yet now, these two ordinary maids had transformed into experts at the sixth level of the Divine Roaming Realm.

The change was too great; Dong Qingyan even found it hard to believe that these two beauties were the previously gentle and graceful Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan.

Yang Kai was secretly astonished, realizing why Elder Xiao was so calm; it turned out he had these two experts guarding him.

Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan battled against the expert from Cangyun Evil Land, leaving him with no chance to fight back. In the midst of the flower rain, the two danced around, each strike inflicting damage, completely gaining the upper hand.

A sudden long howl echoed from afar, the sound urgent and clear.

Upon hearing this voice, the five experts battling Meng Wuya in mid-air exchanged glances, suddenly feigning a move and withdrawing from the battle circle, fleeing without looking back.

Meng Wuya did not pursue them, standing alone in mid-air, taking a deep breath to suppress the turbulent blood in his chest.

The martial artist at the Divine Roaming Realm on the peak saw that his companions had all fled and that he had no hope of escape. He suddenly let out a strange laugh, his True Essence surging violently, and his killing intent grew denser.

"Stop him!" Xiao Fusheng's expression changed, shouting sternly.

But it was still too late. Before Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan could act to stop him, the man's True Essence suddenly dissipated, and he became listless.

He had actually severed his own meridians!

"Hehe..." The man laughed sinisterly before dying, looking disdainfully at the crowd, "The Evil Lord is returning; you cannot resist. Surrender to Cangyun Evil Land early to avoid death!"

After speaking, he fell straight down.

Xiao Fusheng's expression changed drastically as he muttered, "Evil Lord..."
