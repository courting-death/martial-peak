## Chapter 214 — Ling Taixu's Arrangement

“Let’s begin,” Ling Taixu said in a deep voice, then urged his True Essence, striking his palm against the stone wall before him.

Meng Wuya placed his palm on the opposite side, also channeling his True Essence.

The True Essence of the two peak Divine Roaming Realm experts surged forth like a flood that had burst its dam, violently flowing into the stone wall in front of them.

That seemingly ordinary stone wall now appeared to transform into an abyss, with the True Essence pouring in without creating even a ripple, vanishing without a trace.

Yang Kai watched silently from the side, but inside, he felt a storm of emotions brewing.

There must be some extraordinary mystery within this stone wall; otherwise, it wouldn’t be so peculiar. Moreover, this stone wall was located beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine, which might have some connection to it.

After a short while, both Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya began to sweat slightly on their foreheads, outputting their True Essence without restraint. Sustaining such an effort for this long was no small burden for them.

“Ling brother, you’re not mistaken about the location, are you?” Meng Wuya asked, frowning.

“It’s right here,” Ling Taixu replied with certainty.

Moments later, the stone wall finally reacted. The plain stone surface suddenly rippled with a layer of dark, murky waves, quickly spreading outward from a central point.

Seeing this, Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya increased their output of True Essence.

The ripples grew larger and more violent, as if countless small stones were being continuously dropped into a calm lake. Eventually, the layers of ripples surged forth in an unending wave, making the stone wall appear exceedingly strange, causing dizziness in those who gazed upon it.

Meng Wuya’s eyes lit up, and he exclaimed, “Indeed, it’s a void passage connecting two locations, Ling brother. The founding ancestor of your Lingxiao Pavilion is truly remarkable!”

Ling Taixu smiled slightly and suddenly withdrew his hand.

Meng Wuya hurriedly stepped back.

Although the two had ceased their actions, the changes on the stone wall did not stop; instead, they grew even more intense. After a brief moment, the layers of ripples transformed into a tangible form, swirling outward and revealing a pitch-black opening in the stone wall.

Gazing at this suddenly appearing opening, Yang Kai felt as if his soul was about to be drawn in, and he couldn’t help but feel a bit dizzy.

Meng Wuya looked at him with a smile, gently patting Yang Kai’s shoulder with a serious yet reluctant expression, saying, “Little Yang Kai, you must take care!”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown; Shopkeeper Meng’s behavior today was overly affectionate.

“In the days I’m away, I hope Brother Wuya will look after Lingxiao Pavilion,” Ling Taixu instructed, then took Yang Kai and plunged into the black hole before them.

Before entering, Yang Kai glanced back and saw Meng Wuya standing in mid-air, his smile radiant as he waved vigorously, looking overly affectionate.

After Ling Taixu and Yang Kai’s figures disappeared, the black hole in the stone wall suddenly vanished, returning to its previous appearance.

Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Meng Wuya stood still for a long while before laughing heartily.

“Ha ha ha ha…”

His laughter echoed through the heavens, startling countless disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion who were in meditation, causing them to shiver involuntarily.

Heaven had shown mercy, finally sending that brat far away. Now, no one would disturb his precious disciple’s heart. However, he wondered how long it would take for him to return; surely it would take at least a year or two, right? With such a long time, perhaps his precious disciple would forget him.

Without this entanglement, his disciple could cultivate quickly and grow up without worries.

Lost in his thoughts, Meng Wuya laughed heartily once more.

As Ling Taixu and Yang Kai entered the black hole, everything around them turned chaotic. Yet, in just three breaths of time, Yang Kai felt a flash before his eyes, and he and his master appeared on unfamiliar ground.

Ling Taixu looked around and quickly flew in one direction. After a short while, he found a secluded spot and set Yang Kai down, saying, “Guard me; I need to recover for a moment.”

Yang Kai nodded, estimating that the earlier exertion had taken a toll on his master as well.

Ling Taixu took out a pill and swallowed it, sitting quietly for about two hours before standing up, then without further ado, he lifted Yang Kai and flew forward.

Being carried along was entirely different from flying on his own. Ling Taixu enveloped Yang Kai with his True Essence, making him feel no resistance from the wind.

“Master, what was that black hole beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine?” Yang Kai asked, filled with questions.

“It was left by the founding ancestor, a void passage connecting the ends of the world. Using that place, one can easily traverse from Lingxiao Pavilion to another location. As for the specifics, I’m not very clear; after all, my strength is insignificant compared to the founding ancestor,” Ling Taixu explained.

“How far did we just cross?” Yang Kai’s expression was shocked, completely unaware that such a wondrous thing as a void passage existed in this world.

“About ten thousand miles,” Ling Taixu replied flatly.

Yang Kai gasped in surprise. From the moment Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya poured their True Essence into the stone wall to their departure, it had only taken about half an hour. To have traveled ten thousand miles in that time was simply unbelievable, like a dream.

Yang Kai’s mental fortitude was quite good, having experienced great changes in his life, and after a moment of shock, he managed to compose himself.

“Aren’t you going to ask where I’m taking you?” Ling Taixu glanced at him.

“Master will naturally tell me if he wants to; it won’t be anything harmful to me,” Yang Kai replied.

“You’re quite open-minded,” Ling Taixu chuckled bitterly, his gaze becoming profound as he slowly said, “The place I’m sending you to is a land of slaughter. There, killing requires no reason or excuse; the strong are revered, and the weak are prey. This ancient truth is played out to the fullest there, so you must be mentally prepared!”

Yang Kai was taken aback. “What are we going there for?”

“To cultivate, to grow stronger, to glimpse the true essence of martial arts!” Ling Taixu took a deep breath. “If you don’t want to go, I can take you back right now.”

“Of course I want to go!” Yang Kai exclaimed, invigorated at the mention of cultivation and becoming stronger. The desire for strength is inherent in every martial artist. Only by becoming stronger can one avoid being insulted and bullied, only by becoming stronger can one walk further on the path of martial arts and live well.

“Even if you face life-threatening dangers at every moment, you still want to go?” A smile of appreciation appeared at the corner of Ling Taixu’s mouth.

“Of course I want to go.”

“Ha ha ha! Just like the old master! Back then, I also asked the old master this question. Guess what he said?”

Yang Kai thought for a moment, mimicking Fourth Master Yang’s demeanor and tone, and said with a naive expression, “I don’t want to kill; I won’t go!”

Ling Taixu was taken aback, then burst into surprised laughter. “Not a word off! They say no one knows a child better than their father; it seems the reverse is also true.”

Not wanting to kill will only lead to being harmed by others! Your Yang family has weak familial bonds, each one as fierce as wolves and tigers. If you don’t grow stronger, even if you return to the Yang family, you will only be bullied!

Yang Kai now exuded a bloody and violent aura. If he didn’t possess enough strength to protect himself and his family, he would be powerless to resist when bullied in the future, and that aura might truly affect his nature.

Rather than falling into the path of evil and becoming an enemy of the world in the future, it’s better to take a gamble now! Old master, don’t blame me for being ruthless and taking him there without informing you; it’s just that with your temperament, I feared you wouldn’t agree.

“Master, where exactly are we going?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

“It’s not we; it’s you alone. I’m only responsible for sending you there. That place, you should have heard of it, is called the Ghostly Underworld Mountain!” 

Yang Kai’s smile instantly froze, his face twitching uncontrollably as he hesitated for a long while before saying, “Master, you’re not talking about that Ghostly Underworld Mountain, are you?”

“Exactly!” 

Yang Kai’s face twitched even more violently.

The Ghostly Underworld Mountain was infamous throughout the world, notorious for being a forbidden area. For any martial artist, it was a place of doom. Those who stepped in had no chance of survival; no one had ever escaped alive from that forbidden ground.

Of course, this was merely an exaggeration of the dangers of the Ghostly Underworld Mountain, but it was undeniable that it was indeed fraught with peril, far more dangerous than the Black Wind Mountain Range next to Lingxiao Pavilion.

In the Black Wind Mountain Range, ordinary True Essence Realm martial artists could traverse it without obstruction, unless they were unfortunate enough to encounter particularly ferocious beasts. However, in the Ghostly Underworld Mountain, even Divine Roaming Realm experts would find it difficult to survive; the disparity between the two was evident.

Because of its dangers, it was called a forbidden area, and in the entire Great Han Dynasty, there was only one such place.

However, the world is vast, and there are many other forbidden areas like the Ghostly Underworld Mountain. Yang Kai had heard that there was a forbidden area called the Wasteland in the neighboring Tianlang Kingdom, which was equally perilous and perhaps even more so.

In forbidden areas, strange and ferocious beasts abound, and the forests are filled with many unknown dangers; going there is practically seeking death.

But Yang Kai estimated that Ling Taixu must have his own plans. Although his expression changed slightly, he didn’t lose his composure.

Indeed, Ling Taixu seemed to be observing his reaction, and after a moment, he nodded in satisfaction. “We won’t delve deep into the Ghostly Underworld Mountain; we’ll only enter five hundred miles. There’s a very peculiar place there, perfect for a martial artist like you to undergo training.”

“What kind of place?” Yang Kai pressed.

“It’s hard to explain; it’s a very strange place. I was also brought there for training by my master back then, which is how I know of its existence. I had intended to send your father there, but he refused, until your generation came.”

“Many people know of that place’s existence. Now that the time is approaching, many may have gone there in advance. Whether we can secure a spot is still uncertain. If we can enter smoothly, you must remember one thing: everyone who appears there is an enemy! Never trust anyone!” 

“I understand.”

“You don’t understand,” Ling Taixu slowly shook his head, his tone growing heavier, “The peculiar nature of that place creates a situation where everyone is an enemy. Let me put it this way: in that place, the essence and blood of those who are killed will condense into a blood pearl, and anyone can absorb this blood pearl to enhance their own strength without any worries.”

“What?” Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically.
