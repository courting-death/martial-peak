## Chapter 1090 — Why Won't You Just Die?

In the Tempering Pool, Guiche, Ganji, and Luo Yao were all pale and trembling; even as experts at the Second or Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, they barely withstood the overwhelming pressure.

Yang Kai too was racked with pain, overwhelmed by the illusion that his body might burst and he would die.

But the continual growth of that single pure drop of Demon God Golden Blood within him significantly eased his burden, so when he glanced about he found his condition was the best among the four.

The other three were already teetering on the edge, wracked with unbearable pain.

"Ji Ping, what the hell are you doing?" Ganji roared in fury.

Ji Ping looked down from above with a disdainful glance, full of scorn; he said nothing, regarding them as if they were already dead.

Guiche bellowed, "Ji Ping, you'd better pray I can't break free, or I'll flay you and tear your bones out and leave you with no grave!"

Ji Ping laughed heartily, unafraid: "I've already activated the altar beneath the pool. You are the offerings to the pool; no matter what you try you cannot leave it now."

"An altar?" Guiche's face changed; he screamed hoarsely, "So you really hid something from us."

Ji Ping sneered, "If I had told you everything, I'd probably be the one turned into an offering! I'm not ignorant of how treacherous you are, Guiche. Do you really think I brought people in here without planning to monopolize the benefits? What a laugh. Now that it's come to this, I'll tell you: this Tempering Pool holds unfathomable mysteries. It can indeed temper the flesh, but to temper completely you need enough offerings. When you die you'll be like the Thunder Luan — your bodies and your cultivation will transmute into energy. As for me, I'll be like that Avian Tree, growing stronger from your deaths."

Hearing this, their faces drained further; only then did they understand Ji Ping's true intent and see his vicious nature clearly.

Guiche and Ganji were no fools, and under ordinary circumstances wouldn't fall for such an obvious trap, but along the way the gains they'd reaped had loosened their vigilance; they had indulged in their harvests and, seeing Ji Ping jump in first, followed him without thought — only when disaster came did they realize it had all been Ji Ping's plan.

Regret came too late. Each struggled fiercely to leap from the Tempering Pool, but the more they struggled the stronger the pulling force beneath the water became. They could only keep their heads above the surface, accepting the pool's frenzied tempering of their blood while awaiting the end.

"Ji Ping, are you scheming against even me?" Luo Yao's hair tumbled and she looked at Ji Ping with a sorrowful, pleading gaze.

Ji Ping's cruel, triumphant expression softened; he regarded Luo Yao with a tinge of pity and sighed after a long moment: "Although we've known each other only a few years, I don't want you to die. I like you, and I want to enjoy the effects of this Tempering Pool with you."

Luo Yao's face brightened with delight; she believed Ji Ping would spare her.

Unexpectedly, Ji Ping slowly shook his head: "But it's too late now. The altar is already active; you can't get out. I won't go in either. And the number of offerings is too few — when my ancestor came here, more than a dozen were sacrificed. My ancestor wasn't particularly talented; at that time his cultivation was only like that kid's..."

He pointed at Yang Kai: "Only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, the weakest in that group; anyone could bully him and order him about. When they discovered the pool's benefits and excluded him, they seized the pool. Who would know that it was this exclusion that saved his life? After everyone died, my ancestor waited until the pool calmed and alone enjoyed its effects. He recorded in his annals that without this merit he'd, at best, have reached only the Second or Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — that was his limit. But do you know his highest achievement? He reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, one step shy of the Void King Realm!"

Ji Ping's voice swelled with excitement as he waved his hands theatrically: "My talent isn't perfect, but it's much better than my ancestor's. With this pool, I can advance toward the Void King Realm. One day I'll reach it!"

"Void King Realm!" Guiche suddenly burst into a wild laugh, the sound manic; blood welled from the corners of his mouth, his nostrils, eyes and ears, but he ignored it and sneered at Ji Ping, "You really expect trash like you to reach the Void King Realm? The Void King Realm's become worthless."

Ji Ping was unperturbed and said leisurely: "You'll witness it. When you become part of my body you'll see. Luo Yao, I'm sorry, but you'll join them and become part of me. I'll set up a memorial tablet for you to commemorate you properly; there will be many more days ahead — I'm sure I'll meet other women I like."

"Madman! You are insane!" Luo Yao's face drained of color as she hissed.

"Say what you like." Ji Ping's pity vanished and his gaze went cold; watching a group doomed to die, he had nothing more to say — his earlier words had been mere venting.

Those in the pool fared ever worse; except for Yang Kai, the others' blood boiled as if erupting, rupturing their meridians, tearing flesh and seeping through the skin; crimson blood flowed into the Tempering Pool, staining it even redder.

Yang Kai felt only discomfort, not mortal danger.

A person's bodily capacity is limited, just like storing Saint Yuan in the Dantian; once other cultivators reached that limit they could not store more — forcibly adding more would bring endless trouble and might burst the Dantian and kill them.

Yang Kai was different: he used to condense Yang Liquid and could now store surplus Saint Yuan into every inch of his flesh; his body had no bottom.

The Tempering Pool's effect was like the Saint Yuan they'd been cultivating; Ji Ping had opened the altar below and pushed the pool's power to its maximum. Guiche, Ganji, and Luo Yao could not withstand such tempering — death was only a matter of time.

Yang Kai, however, could transform the tempering into true Demon God Golden Blood; the fiercer the tempering the better. He already had ten drops of Demon God Golden Blood, each drop containing heart-stopping power.

A wrenching howl sounded as Ganji suddenly went mad; a tide of force exploded from him as he wildly lashed out, his eyes turning red and blood streaming from the sockets, a pitiful sight.

Thud...

A muffled crash and a great splash rose from the pool; when the water settled, Ganji's place was empty — only floating chunks of meat and severed limbs remained, which sank and dissolved into massive nutrients.

With Ganji's death the pool boiled more violently, and Yang Kai plainly felt the incoming force pouring into him grow stronger; the pain nearly made him cry out.

What Ji Ping spoke of wasn't a threat but reality — Ganji had died as an offering, and the pool's effect had intensified.

The next moment Luo Yao's shriek split the sky; the coquettish yet dignified young woman followed Ganji into the same fate.

Before she died, Luo Yao's beautiful eyes filled with unforgettable hatred as she stared at Ji Ping, as if trying to imprint his ugliness into her soul.

One after another they burst and died without bones remaining, and the Tempering Pool's effect leaped another grade.

Even Guiche, the strongest among them, could no longer hold on and, abandoning shame, cried desperately, "Ji Ping, get me out and I'll give you my Spatial Ring!"

Ji Ping remained indifferent and replied coldly: "You're dead. When the pool calms I will go down and collect everything in your Spatial Ring, every last item — all of this will be mine."

"You'll be punished for this!" Guiche roared.

Ji Ping laughed arrogantly: "I'm waiting, but you won't have the chance to see it."

No sooner had he finished than Guiche exploded completely; the Spatial Ring he wore flew up into the air and then plunged into the pool, disappearing.

Ji Ping watched hungrily but did not immediately retrieve it.

After a while his face turned strange as he said, "How can even souls be dissolved?"

He had been wary of the dead escaping with their souls and had been prepared to destroy them; he never expected that the souls showed no sign of escaping and seemed to have been consumed along with the flesh as offerings.

Muttering to himself, he suddenly turned to Yang Kai with a frown and said, "Kid, why won't you just die?"

Yang Kai's forehead bulged with veins as he endured unimaginable agony, but shook his head: "I don't know. Maybe my cultivation is too low, or I'm still at the edge — do you want to come down and check?"

Ji Ping snorted coldly: "Do you take me for an idiot?"

Yang Kai nodded heavily: "You truly are an idiot, only watching what's before you and not seeing an ambush from behind."

Ji Ping's face changed as he turned sharply and saw a horned man bloodied and cloaking his aura, silently approaching from behind.

"Diji?" Ji Ping's face went ashen with terror.

When he took in the yao expert's condition he grew calmer; Diji was bloodied and battered, clearly having faced danger and battle and looking miserable, and he was alone — his former companions were nowhere to be seen.
