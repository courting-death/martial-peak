## Chapter 108 — Xia Ningshang Blocked

The Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was elusive and unpredictable, and the valley was vast. If luck favored him and he stumbled upon some, he could collect it along the way, thus easing a burden from his heart.

Before coming, Yang Kai had asked several times, but neither Xia Ningshang nor Old Meng had given him a direct answer, only saying they would tell him when the time came. This left Yang Kai somewhat puzzled and suspicious.

Now was the time to find out more clearly.

Yang Kai still remembered well where Xia Ningshang was hiding. Carefully, he ran in that direction, all the while paying close attention to the reaction of the Yang Source Seal on his chest, hoping to detect the presence of Yuan Lang.

But along the way, the Yang Source Seal showed no response at all. Yuan Lang’s whereabouts remained unknown, leaving Yang Kai helpless. After all, his sensing range was only two hundred zhang; once Yuan Lang moved beyond that, Yang Kai could no longer track him.

After a hurried incense stick’s time, just as he was about to reach Xia Ningshang’s hiding place, the Yang Source Seal on his chest suddenly reacted!

Yang Kai’s heart leapt with joy!

He was shocked that Yuan Lang was now very close to Xia Ningshang, and delighted to have finally located this Blood Battle Gang disciple.

Had Yuan Lang already discovered Xia Ningshang? Thinking this, Yang Kai hastened his approach, holding his breath and listening intently for any sound.

After a moment, Yang Kai exhaled in relief. It was quiet and still; Yuan Lang had not found Xia Ningshang’s hiding place, or else a fight would have broken out by now.

Yang Kai was not overly worried about Xia Ningshang’s safety; after all, she could still activate her Heaven-Grade defensive secret treasure. But her hiding spot was awkwardly narrow, only wide enough for one person to pass. If Yuan Lang blocked the entrance and sent out a howl to summon Long Hui and that other expert, things would become troublesome.

With this thought, Yang Kai grew even more cautious.

At this moment, Xia Ningshang was also extremely tense. Since Yang Kai’s departure, she had been recovering here, having endured Wen Feichen’s palm strike, activated her Heaven-Grade secret treasure, and set up the Jiuyin Eight-Lock Formation. Her consumption of energy far exceeded anyone else’s.

After such a long recovery, having used all the pills she carried, her strength had only recovered to about twenty percent—roughly equivalent to the seventh or eighth stage of the Open Origin Realm at best.

Just now, some movement outside startled her heart into a rapid beat. She dared not move within the narrow crevice, her bright eyes narrowing as she peered out, trying to see who had come nearby.

She hoped it was Yang Kai, but if it truly were him, there would be no reason for him not to enter immediately.

The person outside lingered for quite some time but could not find a way in. Naturally, this was not the person she wished to see.

It was an enemy! But she did not know how strong this person was.

The intruder searched carefully for the duration of an incense stick, yet found nothing. Just as they were about to leave in haste, Xia Ningshang let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.

At that moment, rustling came from the bushes at the entrance of the crevice. Xia Ningshang’s heart jumped again.

Suddenly, a small black shadow darted out from the bushes, leaping directly in front of her.

Startled, she almost cried out, but upon closer look, she could only laugh wryly.

It was a squirrel living in the valley, likely chilled by the Yin energy, seeking shelter in this windless crevice.

Cautiously, Xia Ningshang reached out to catch it, but the squirrel was wary. Sensing a person nearby, it immediately leapt away.

Midair, a large hand suddenly appeared, firmly grasping the squirrel and squeezing hard. Blood splattered.

“Hehehe!” A sinister laugh rang out. Yuan Lang’s burly figure blocked the only entrance to the crevice, his face alight with delight as he looked at Xia Ningshang sitting inside. “So this is where you’re hiding!”

Xia Ningshang’s expression instantly turned cold, her beautiful eyes flashing with anger. Women generally cared deeply for small animals, especially those as cute as this squirrel. Though the creature had revealed her position, Yuan Lang’s cruel act enraged her.

“Making me search for you was no easy task!” Yuan Lang stood at the crevice’s mouth, leisurely scrutinizing Xia Ningshang. “Lost the chance to catch Yang Kai, but finding you is still a great achievement!”

His words eased Xia Ningshang’s mind somewhat; at least her junior brother was safe.

“If you dare come any closer, I will make sure you die without a grave!” Xia Ningshang threatened coldly. But being naturally innocent, she blushed even when lying. If these words had come from someone else, they might have carried some weight. Yuan Lang, however, detected the hesitation in her voice and laughed aloud. “Do you still have the strength to fight? After taking Lord Wen’s palm strike, you’re lucky not to have fainted on the spot. Now, you’re barely clinging to life.”

Though Yuan Lang’s power was currently sealed, Xia Ningshang was in no better state. If a fight broke out, Yuan Lang would not fear her. Both were truly at the Separation and Union Realm, his slightly higher, hers slightly lower.

With the only exit blocked by Yuan Lang himself, he held every advantage and was confident of victory.

“Behave, and I promise you won’t suffer. Resist, and don’t blame me for being ruthless,” Yuan Lang threatened viciously.

Xia Ningshang remained silent, quietly condensing her Yuan Qi, preparing to strike hard once he approached. But Yuan Lang clearly knew her plan and refused to come closer, merely blocking the entrance and forcing her to suffer in frustration.

“I know you have a Heaven-Grade defensive secret treasure. In my current state, I really can’t harm you. But what if I send word to bring others? Would you still have a chance to escape?” Yuan Lang was in no hurry, adopting the attitude of a cat toying with a mouse, trying to break her psychological defenses with words.

“What do you want?” Xia Ningshang asked coldly.

“What do I want? Heh, that’s a question I should ask you. If you want to live, obey a few conditions. Refuse, and I’ll call reinforcements now!” Sensing the moment had come, Yuan Lang finally revealed his true intentions.

“What conditions?” Xia Ningshang was happy to stall for time. Every moment gained meant more recovery of her Yuan Qi.

“First, seal your Yuan Qi and surrender obediently. Second, hand over that defensive secret treasure to me. Third...” Yuan Lang’s smile turned lecherous, “Remove your veil so I can see your true face. Don’t worry, I won’t harm you. If you’re truly a beauty, I’ll spare you and never trouble you.”

No child would believe such words. If Xia Ningshang truly sealed her Yuan Qi, Yuan Lang could do as he pleased. In this dark, windless place, how could any man resist the temptation of beauty?

Though innocent, Xia Ningshang was not so naive as to be easily deceived. She lightly scolded, “Delusional!”
