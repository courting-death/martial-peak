## Chapter 125 — Entry

Yang Kai inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he had spent a great deal today purchasing numerous Yang Flame Stones; otherwise, he would have lacked the confidence to enter the Inheritance Celestial Realm.

Now, with nearly fifty drops of Yang Liquid stored within his Dantian, it should suffice. What dangers awaited within that Inheritance Celestial Realm, however, remained unknown.

As he sat in meditation, Yang Kai felt as if someone was watching him. He quickly opened his eyes and saw Su Yan averting her gaze some dozens of zhang away, speaking quietly with Su Mu, who nodded solemnly.

His gaze flickered but he paid it no mind.

Suddenly, a commotion arose from the Blood Battle Gang’s side. Fifty selected members were about to enter the Inheritance Cave ahead of schedule.

This was the result of negotiations among the three sects’ elders. Lingxiao Pavilion and Fengyu Tower wished to claim a share within the Inheritance Celestial Realm. Hu Man and the others could not prevent this but refused to let these two sects benefit without compensation.

Thus, the agreement was that each of the two sects would compensate the Blood Battle Gang with one million taels of silver. In return, the Blood Battle Gang would send fifty disciples to enter the Inheritance Cave first. Only after half a day would the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion and Fengyu Tower be permitted entry.

Both Lingxiao Pavilion and Fengyu Tower consented to these terms.

Yang Kai looked over and saw that these fifty were undoubtedly the Blood Battle Gang’s elite, granted half a day’s priority inside the Inheritance Cave. If there truly were treasures within, they would discover them first.

Among them were the sisters Hu Mei’er and Hu Jiao’er, surrounded like stars by the Blood Battle Gang’s disciples, standing at the center.

These twin sisters were peerless beauties, appearing side by side with overwhelming presence. Their allure attracted many male disciples’ gazes, each silently wishing to possess one, deeming their lives fulfilled if they could.

The fifty Blood Battle Gang disciples approached the large pit, guarded by their masters, and one by one leapt down, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

As the Blood Battle Gang’s group continued entering the Inheritance Cave, a striking figure suddenly flew over from the Lingxiao Pavilion side. She hurried along, head down, and arrived directly above the mining area.

Hu Man and the others shouted angrily, “Who goes there?”

They suspected someone was trying to sneak in alongside the Blood Battle Gang’s disciples.

“Who dares call out?” Meng Wuya glared at the Blood Battle Gang’s many experts, then beckoned to the somewhat confused figure, “Disciple, come here!”

Only then did Hu Man and the others realize this person was the mad old man’s disciple!

Looking closely, Hu Man sighed. Just as he had suspected, it was a woman! Though her face was veiled, her clear, innocent eyes and graceful, enchanting figure were far from ordinary.

What shocked Hu Man even more was that this young woman already possessed True Essence Realm strength.

“Old Long, this trouble is all because of Long Hui!” Hu Man cast a meaningful glance at Long Zaitian, clearly displeased.

Long Zaitian’s eyes burned with deep hatred, fixated on the pair of master and disciple above, yet he felt powerless. He had already witnessed Meng Wuya’s profound strength and knew revenge was impossible in this lifetime. Recalling the humiliation he suffered half a day ago, sorrow welled up, and he spat a mouthful of congealed blood.

The newcomer was naturally Xia Ningshang. Having been in seclusion at Lingxiao Pavilion, she hurried over upon receiving Meng Wuya’s message. Still uncertain of the situation, she saw thousands of eyes fixed on her below and was momentarily frightened, hastening to her master’s side.

“There is opportunity below; you must go!” Meng Wuya pointed toward the Inheritance Celestial Realm and said calmly.

“Oh!” Xia Ningshang obediently nodded, glanced at the luminous curtain below, then looked around as if searching for someone. But night had fallen, and surrounded by so many disciples from the three sects, she could not find the person she sought.

Only when Meng Wuya urged her again did Xia Ningshang bite her lip and rush headlong into the Inheritance Celestial Realm, even entering ahead of many Blood Battle Gang disciples.

Throughout, the Blood Battle Gang’s group watched silently, no one daring to intervene.

Wei Xitong and the others were stunned! They had never imagined the Contribution Hall’s shopkeeper to be so domineering! Facing the entire Blood Battle Gang alone, he remained composed, disregarding the three sects’ agreement, and simply ordered his disciple to enter first. Hu Man and the others turned a blind eye.

What was going on?

Xiao Ruohan was also puzzled, frowning as he loudly asked, “Chief Hu, what is the meaning of this? This seems to contradict the agreement. Why can Lingxiao Pavilion’s disciple enter alongside your gang’s members?”

Hu Man wished he could sew Xiao Ruohan’s mouth shut. Meng Wuya’s arrogance was already embarrassing enough. He wanted to pretend not to see it—better to avoid trouble. After all, it was just one extra outsider entering, no great harm done. This was also to save face for Meng Wuya and ease the tension between him and the Blood Battle Gang.

But Xiao Ruohan was relentless, pressing the issue. Damn it!

Meng Wuya sneered but said nothing.

Helpless, Hu Man cleared his throat and explained, “The barrier here was broken thanks to this elder’s methods. Therefore, his disciple is also entitled to priority entry.”

Xiao Ruohan sneered, “Then why did Chief Hu not mention this during the three sects’ negotiations?”

Hu Man was speechless, thinking, How could I? I didn’t know this mad old man would pull such a stunt. I’m innocent in this!

“Chief Hu, are you mocking Fengyu Tower? Lingxiao Pavilion’s disciples may enter first, but why not ours?” Xiao Ruohan pressed on.

“Damn your grandmother!” Hu Man cursed in frustration, then looked around just in time to see the last Blood Battle Gang disciple about to enter the luminous curtain. He shouted, “You there, don’t go in! Save a spot for this elder’s disciple!”

Unfortunately, the last to enter was Long Zaitian’s eldest grandson, Long Jun!

Long Jun had been excitedly preparing to enter the Inheritance Celestial Realm, dreaming of receiving a master’s inheritance and soaring to greatness. This shout froze him in place. He turned to Long Zaitian, who took a deep breath, closed his eyes slowly, and said weakly, “Since the chief says so, Jun’er, you must wait half a day.”

“Yes!” Long Jun gritted his teeth, unwilling but obedient.

“Master Xiao, you have no more objections now, right?” Hu Man said angrily. “Let’s just say this elder’s disciple took one of our Blood Battle Gang’s spots.”

Xiao Ruohan frowned, unable to grasp the full intricacies but ceased pressing the matter, snorting coldly and turning away.

Wei Xitong observed everything and said moved, “It seems Hu Man fears Shopkeeper Meng greatly.”

Su Xuanwu chuckled softly, “We all underestimated this shopkeeper’s abilities.”

Over there, Hu Man looked up at Meng Wuya, forcing a smile. “Elder, are you satisfied now?”

Meng Wuya chuckled strangely, “Satisfied or not, we shall see when my precious disciple emerges. I warn you, if anything untoward befalls her inside, do not blame me for turning hostile!”

Hu Man’s expression changed, a trace of hostility flashing, but he could only force a dry laugh and nod, “That won’t happen!”

Damn, he had to remind his disciples to treat that little lady well inside, ensuring no harm came to her.

Without delay, Hu Man hurriedly issued orders, and the Blood Battle Gang disciples followed obediently.

Meng Wuya’s overwhelming presence astonished all Lingxiao Pavilion disciples. None had expected the usually lecherous Contribution Hall shopkeeper to be so formidable.

Even the Blood Battle Gang’s Hu Man behaved meekly before him, like rabbits before a tiger. Not even the great elder Wei Xitong could match this.

After the lively scene, calm returned. The three sects’ disciples busied themselves recovering, awaiting the joint entry into the Inheritance Cave later that night.

“How many disciples will perish inside this time? How many will return with gains?” Second Elder Su Xuanwu sighed softly.

“But those who emerge with benefits will surely become pillars of the three sects!” Wei Xitong’s eyes gleamed with hope.

“Let us hope so.”

Night fell quietly, frost clinging to the treetops, time flowing steadily.

Suddenly, the elders of the three sects stirred. At their call, the disciples preparing to enter the Inheritance Cave all awoke.

The time had come.

Half a day had passed since the Blood Battle Gang’s elite entered. Now, the main force was to proceed.

At Lingxiao Pavilion, Jie Hongchen and Su Yan led the way. Behind them, the disciples lined up, moving steadily toward the luminous curtain.

Yang Kai walked alongside Su Mu, who appeared nervous, rubbing his hands anxiously. Yang Kai felt some tension himself, though more excitement and anticipation.

“If only we could meet inside,” Su Mu whispered.

“Hopefully. But the great elder said that once inside the curtain, everyone’s landing spots differ. The chance of meeting is slim.”

“Senior Brother, what kind of inheritance do you think awaits inside?”

“How would I know?”

“What dangers might there be?”

“I don’t know either.”

“So nervous!”

Yang Kai had not been so tense, but Su Mu’s constant murmuring tightened his nerves.

Ahead, the three sects’ elders took their positions, arranging their disciples’ entry.

The luminous curtain was vast, so the disciples entered swiftly. Soon, it was Yang Kai and Su Mu’s turn.

They exchanged a glance and leapt down.

Squinting, Yang Kai tried to perceive what changes might occur. But as he fell through the curtain, his vision blurred. When it cleared, he found himself suspended midair, about five zhang above the ground.

Drawing a breath, Yang Kai landed steadily.

Standing firm, he looked around. This was a peculiar space—no sun, no moon, no stars, no clouds or blue sky. Above was a void so silent it unsettled the heart. Yet light still permeated, allowing clear sight within.
