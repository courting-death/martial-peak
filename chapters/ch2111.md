## Chapter 2111 — Dragon Isle Token

Hua Qingsi glared at him, both fearful and resentful. When she thought of her grievances, her lips quivered, and she plopped down on the ground, throwing a tantrum: “You bastard, heartless fiend, worse than a pig or dog! I curse you to die and go to hell, never to be reborn for all eternity…”

Yang Kai’s face darkened with exasperation.

After waiting a while and seeing she had no intention of stopping, Yang Kai finally shouted angrily, “Enough!”

Hua Qingsi’s voice cut off abruptly, but she kept sobbing, her delicate shoulders trembling…

“A dignified Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert, yet you spew such filth. What kind of conduct is that!” Yang Kai reprimanded.

Hua Qingsi protested, “Then what do you want me to do… I can’t beat you, and now you won’t even let me curse?”

“If you behave, I won’t torment you any further.” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Hua Qingsi nodded repeatedly, saying, “I’ll behave, I’ll behave, I’m the most obedient.” As she spoke, she wiped away her tears and forced a smile at Yang Kai, uglier than crying.

“You should have done so from the start.” Yang Kai snorted.

After pondering for a moment, he slowly walked over to Hua Qingsi and reached out a hand.

Hua Qingsi instinctively shrank back, clearly afraid, but when she saw Yang Kai meant no harm she pursed her red lips, gathered her courage, reached out, and let Yang Kai pull her up.

“Come with me!” Yang Kai said, and with a surge of power, he took Hua Qingsi and teleported away.

Her vision blurred, and when Hua Qingsi came to her senses, the two were already inside a bamboo loft.

The bamboo loft was simple, yet elegant and clean.

“There are buildings like this here?” Hua Qingsi asked in surprise. “Does someone live here?”

“There used to be.” Yang Kai replied blandly.

Years ago, when he brought his friends and family from Tongxuan Continent to Dark Star, the Small Xuan Realm housed over ten thousand people.

Naturally, many dwellings remained here.

“Sit.” Yang Kai gestured, then sat down himself.

Hua Qingsi hesitated for a moment, then sat across from Yang Kai.

“I have a few questions for you. Answer honestly.” Yang Kai spoke once she was seated.

Hua Qingsi nodded.

“You came to Fenglin City to investigate Han Leng’s death, right?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Qingsi hesitated, but finally nodded, “Yes!”

“Why?” Yang Kai asked, looking at her.

Hua Qingsi considered her words, then said, “Junior Brother Han Leng was once a disciple under my Honored Master, but he was expelled. When he escaped from Star God Palace years ago, he apparently stole a treasure from my master! My main purpose in pursuing the cause of Junior Brother Han’s death is to find that item!”

“What item?”

“My master didn’t specify, only said it was a token!”

“A token?” Yang Kai raised his brows. But soon, as if recalling something, he took out a strange token from his Spatial Ring and handed it to Hua Qingsi, “Is it this?”

The token was palm-sized, made of a special material—neither metal nor wood. On the front was the character ‘Dragon’, and on the back, a carving of a True Dragon soaring through the clouds.

Yang Kai had found this token in Han Leng’s Spatial Ring, but at the time, he didn’t know its purpose, so he simply left it there.

Now, hearing Hua Qingsi say she was sent by her master for this token, Yang Kai immediately realized it must be something extraordinary!

He became aware that this token was likely no ordinary item!

Hua Qingsi was a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator; her master must be at least a Second Stage of the Emperor Realm expert. For something to be coveted by such a powerful Emperor Realm expert, it must be valuable.

“You found this in Junior Brother Han Leng’s Spatial Ring?” Hua Qingsi asked.

“That’s right!”

“If there were no other tokens in Han Leng’s ring, then this should be my mission target.” Hua Qingsi looked at the token with a strange expression.

“Do you recognize it?” Yang Kai asked, watching her reaction.

Hua Qingsi shook her head at first, but then picked up the token, carefully feeling and examining it. Her expression gradually changed, and after a long while, she suddenly trembled, covering her mouth in shock.

“Speak!” Yang Kai urged impatiently.

“If I’m not mistaken… this should be the famed Dragon Isle Token!” Hua Qingsi exclaimed.

“Dragon Isle Token?” Yang Kai frowned. “What is that?”

“You’ve never heard of it?” Hua Qingsi looked at Yang Kai in surprise, as if shocked he hadn’t heard of such a thing. She thought he really was quite ignorant.

But seeing Yang Kai’s expression, she swallowed her teasing words.

She cautiously asked, “Have you ever heard of Dragon Isle…?”

“Dragon Isle? Are there real dragons living there?” Yang Kai retorted, then chuckled, “Just kidding.”

Hua Qingsi’s face remained tense and serious.

“Dragon Isle… there really are True Dragons living there?” Yang Kai asked tentatively.

Hua Qingsi nodded.

“Nonsense!” Yang Kai rolled his eyes.

True Dragons were one of the most powerful existences among the Ancient Divine Spirits; beings such as True Dragons and Heavenly Phoenixes should exist only in legends and ancient texts, and by all rights should not appear in the world at all.

Hua Qingsi’s pretty face flushed. She shot Yang Kai a glance and said, “If Dragon Isle truly exists, then real dragons do live there—and… not just one.”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, unsure what to say.

Hua Qingsi said, “It’s said that Dragon Isle is the most mysterious and powerful force in the entire Star Realm, because many descendants of True Dragons live there, even ancient and primordial dragons… They are beings that even the Ten Great Emperors fear. But whether Dragon Isle truly exists, we don’t know. Only the strongest cultivators can learn such secrets, and only they can find the way to Dragon Isle.”

“The Dragon Isle Token is something that originated from Dragon Isle,” Hua Qingsi continued. “Whoever holds it can go to Dragon Isle and request the Dragon Race to do one thing for them, as long as it’s within the race’s power! For example, if I took this token to Dragon Isle, I could ask the dragon race to use True Dragon power to help me ascend to the Emperor Realm—and not just the First Stage…”

At this, Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes were full of longing. She gripped the Dragon Isle Token tightly, her breathing growing rapid!

Yang Kai beckoned, and the Dragon Isle Token flew back into his hand. He glanced at Hua Qingsi and said, “Continue!”

Hua Qingsi gave an awkward smile, restraining her excitement. “Since ancient times, only five Dragon Isle Tokens have ever circulated. In the old legends, three of them were used, and each time, the entire Star Realm was shaken!”

She raised a finger and recounted, “First, eighty thousand years ago, the second-ranked sect in the Northern Territory, Xuanshuang Sect, was wiped out overnight. Tens of thousands of disciples perished, including all Emperor Realm experts! It’s said that even now, traces of dragon aura remain at the ruins, and many cultivators go there seeking fortune.”

“Second, fifty thousand years ago, some reckless fellow angered the Divine Spirit Shihuo. In its rage, Shihuo turned the entire Southern Territory upside down, countless lives lost, sects and races destroyed. Even the Ten Great Emperors intervened, but couldn’t stop Shihuo’s rampage. In the end, Dragon Isle stepped in and forced Shihuo to retreat. Otherwise, the Southern Territory would have been devastated.”

“Third, thirty thousand years ago, the death of the strongest human, Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, is said to have involved the dragon race. That battle shattered the heavens and moved the stars, the laws of the world were overturned…”

“Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was killed by the dragon race?” Yang Kai interrupted, suspicious.

Hua Qingsi stuck out her tongue, “It’s just a legend, I don’t know if it’s true. But it’s possible—Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was the strongest expert of his time. Even if others joined forces, they might not have been able to kill him. The dragon race’s involvement makes sense.”

At this, she looked at Yang Kai in confusion, “You’ve heard of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor too?”

“You really think I’m a country bumpkin?” Yang Kai shot her a sidelong glance.

Hua Qingsi laughed awkwardly, “Anyway, those three major events are all said to be related to the use of the Dragon Isle Token. If this is truly a Dragon Isle Token, then, Sir… you must plan carefully how to use it. It’s a priceless treasure.”

“Why are you so concerned?” Yang Kai snorted.

Hua Qingsi muttered in dissatisfaction, “Can’t I care a little?”

“Can you be sure this is a Dragon Isle Token?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Qingsi shook her head, “I’ve never seen a real Dragon Isle Token, but judging by its patterns and material, it’s very likely. If you’re unsure, you could ask someone knowledgeable—maybe you’ll get some clues.”

“Whether Dragon Isle really exists, or where it is, no one knows. It’s too early to worry about the Dragon Isle Token,” Yang Kai said, putting the token away again.

Still, he had someone in mind to ask—maybe he could get accurate information.

“Sir…” Hua Qingsi fidgeted, looking uneasy as she gazed at Yang Kai, “I’ve said everything I know… so…”

“Don’t even think about it!” Yang Kai refused flatly.

“Are you really going to keep me locked up here forever?” Hua Qingsi was exasperated. “I’m from Star God Palace, sent by my master to search for Junior Brother Han’s belongings. If I don’t return soon, my master will come looking for me—and might even track you down.”

At this, she nodded emphatically, “He’ll definitely come after you. You don’t want my master targeting you, do you? He’s a Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. Let me go, and we can part peacefully.”
