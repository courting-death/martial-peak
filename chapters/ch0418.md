## Chapter 418 — What Choice Will You Make?

A few months ago, Lü Si ascended Hidden Cloud Peak and handed the letter and jade pendant given to him by Yang Kai to Xiao Fusheng. The master immediately forged a Mysterious Pill for him. After ingesting the pill and absorbing its effects, Lü Si completely freed himself from his former agony and genuinely transcended beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

After returning to the Lü Family, Lü Si immediately summoned Lü Liang and entrusted him with some confidential matters.

What Elder Si said to the family head remains unknown, but the high-ranking members of the clan sensed that Lü Liang’s attitude toward Yang Kai had shifted since Lü Si’s return. This change was the reason Lü Liang readily allowed Lü Song to bring many valuable items to Zhongdu as compensation to Yang Kai.

Lü Song himself was not clear on the subtle intricacies behind this decision, so he still struggled to understand his father’s reasoning.

“If Yang Kai loses in the succession war, why should I give him so much stuff?” Lü Song shook his head in puzzlement. He muttered under his breath, “This is troublesome, really troublesome!”

At his side, a powerful warrior said, “Young master, perhaps we should first observe how Yang Kai performs. The master only said to hand over the items; he never specified when. If Yang Kai can’t survive tonight, the materials can be dealt with as you see fit. But if he does well, we must follow master’s orders.”

“That’s right, let’s do that.” Lü Song nodded earnestly. “If he loses on the first day of the succession war, his standing within the Yang Family will be negligible. A man like that is not worth befriending.”

“Absolutely!” the warrior agreed.

In the northwest corner of War City, at Yang Kai’s residence.

Inside a room, Yang Kai sat lazily as a maid served him tea. He took a sip and then waved her away.

Before leaving, the maid glanced fearfully at Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu.

These two Blood Servants had grown increasingly worse in recent days. Ever since Yang Kai had sent them out to subdue the minor powers in Zhongdu’s Northern District, their bodies grew weaker and their injuries showed no sign of healing, even after taking Yang Family’s specially made Healing Pills.

Their foundations were damaged.

Both Yang Kai and the two men were painfully aware of this fact. If it were not for that, with their strength and vitality, the injuries would have improved somewhat.

At this moment, their faces were pale as death, sweat pouring down their bodies from intense internal agony. Their expressions fluctuated between calm and grimace, with veins bulging on their foreheads like twisted worms, a terrifying sight.

Any ordinary person seeing this would naturally be horrified.

Yet they stood like spears—straight and motionless.

Yang Kai lifted his gaze to them, his eyes brimming with admiration.

He himself possessed great composure and a resolute nature. Yet if he put himself in their position, enduring what they were, he doubted he could do better.

At the very least, their master seemed to regard them as little more than tools, focused solely on squeezing every last bit of value from their waning lives before discarding them. This alone was something Yang Kai could not accept.

But their loyalty to the Yang Family was absolute—without complaint, never showing displeasure in their expressions, they remained steadfastly devoted to Yang Kai, obeying orders without a single word of dissent.

Noticing Yang Kai’s gaze, Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu became even more attentive.

After a long moment, Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Which one of you is Qu Gaoyi?”

Honestly, Yang Kai did not know who was who, for since their return from the Blood Servants Hall, no words had been exchanged between them.

The taller, sturdier man immediately clasped his fists. “I am Qu Gaoyi, your servant!”

“And you must be Ying Jiu?” Yang Kai looked at the other.

Ying Jiu nodded slightly. Compared to Qu Gaoyi, Ying Jiu was a peculiar figure—although male, he was slender and delicate, with a pair of small moustaches at the corners of his mouth, giving him an especially sharp appearance. He was also more taciturn, a lone wolf in temperament, much like Yang Wei.

From brief remarks by Fourth Master Yang and Dong Suzhu, Yang Kai had learned their specializations.

Qu Gaoyi excelled in rapid bursts of power, capable of unleashing all his True Essence and Divine Sense within the span of an incense stick. His attacks were unrelenting, leaving no opportunity for his enemies to breathe. For that brief time, he was essentially invincible among warriors of the same Realm.

He was the most reckless fighter in the entire Blood Servants Hall! Although he was an Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert, over the years he had defeated many masters at the peak of that Realm.

Even among the Blood Servants Hall, his strength ranked near the top.

Ying Jiu, however, was different—his specialty was speed and stealth, striking without a shadow and vanishing without a trace. His concealment skills were exceptional, and his attacks left enemies no time to respond.

There were rumors that the most troublesome Blood Servant in the Yang Family was not the Hall Chief Feng Sheng nor the Deputy Hall Chief Zhou Feng, but Ying Jiu—like a shadow, relentless and unavoidable.

No matter how far one fled, they could not escape his pursuit.

Together, these two complemented each other perfectly, a fearsome duo.

Last time, while escorting Yang Xinwu, the fourth young master of the Yang Family, back to the clan, they were ambushed by many Divine Roaming Realm experts. The enemies they faced were even stronger than those Yang Kai had encountered.

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu fought desperately to protect Yang Xinwu, but due to Yang Xinwu’s weak abilities, their mission ended in tragedy.

Yang Kai suddenly spoke to them, leaving both Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu puzzled, unsure of what instructions he might issue. They looked at him with curiosity.

“Do either of you bear grievances against me?” Unexpectedly, Yang Kai asked.

A faint smile played across his lips, his gaze deep and meaningful.

Qu Gaoyi hastened to say, “Your servant dares not.”

“Not even a little?” Yang Kai snorted softly. “I want the truth.”

Qu Gaoyi’s face showed some difficulty as he exchanged glances with Ying Jiu, unsure how to respond.

Back at the Blood Servants Hall, they had heard Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian praise the young master’s kindness and how well he treated the Blood Servants. Later, when Yang Kai had chosen them as attendants in their darkest hour, gratitude overwhelmed their hearts. They had vowed to help Yang Kai carve out a great future, even if it meant losing their lives.

Yet these past few days, Yang Kai had not even given them a second glance. His demeanor was cold, and he never allowed them any time to recuperate.

Though loyal to the Yang Family, they were still human. “A knight dies for his lord,” but Yang Kai’s obvious disregard weighed heavily on their hearts.

“Speak,” Yang Kai said solemnly as he took a sip of tea.

Qu Gaoyi pressed his cracked lips together before replying, “Ying Jiu and I were at our wit’s end until the young master helped us in our moment of peril. We are forever grateful, and bear you no grievance—only… some disappointment.”

His words were candid and earnest, clearly heartfelt.

Yang Kai’s lips curled. “Do you feel I am different from what Tu Feng and the others described?”

Qu Gaoyi nodded gently. Ying Jiu echoed him.

“Of course I’m different,” Yang Kai said, standing. “Because I never intended to choose you! I prefer Tu Feng and Yuxian—we have a history.”

The two Blood Servants’ expressions soured.

“But familiarity grows with time—I think we know each other well enough now.” Yang Kai smiled at them. “At least, I now know your true feelings.”

Their eyes brightened as they looked silently at him. Yang Kai’s words meant he wished to communicate—something both had long hoped for.

“Your loyalty to the Yang Family, I do not doubt. Your gratitude toward me, also no doubt! But if one day conflict arises between me and the Yang Family, what would you choose? Stand by me or the Yang Family?”

Their faces changed with shock, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“You jest, young master?” Qu Gaoyi frowned.

“I am serious.” Yang Kai fixed him with an unblinking stare.

Qu Gaoyi took a deep breath. “Though I hope such a day never comes, should it, Ying Jiu and I will still follow your side!”

Rarely speaking, Ying Jiu’s voice was cold and resolute: “Without the young master, the two of us would probably have already crippled our cultivation and withdrawn into obscurity. So this cultivation is yours; use it as you need.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally smiled widely.

Their words revealed two things: firstly, as members of the Yang Family, they didn’t truly believe such a conflict would occur; secondly, they felt their own time was limited, and if that day did come, it would be beyond their time.

Regardless, Yang Kai had finally obtained the answer he sought.

“I once told Yuxian that those who learn my secrets must either become mine or become dead!” His smile grew sinister, radiating palpable evil energy. “Now, you are qualified to know some of my secrets.”

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu froze at this, looking at him with surprise, uncertain of his meaning.

“These two pills, one for each of you. Take them.” Yang Kai tossed two pills to them.

They caught the pills and thanked him politely, though their hearts brimmed with questions.
