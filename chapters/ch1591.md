## Chapter 1591 — Comprehension

In an instant, the Purple Shield rang with the clash of metal; terrifying power imperceptible to the naked eye transformed into formless attacks that kept battering Yang Kai's Secret Treasure.

The purple radiance covering his body began to fade at a rate visible to the naked eye.

Yang Kai's face darkened; he hastily withdrew the Purple Shield.

Though his Secret Treasure was an Origin-Grade Upper-Level item and exceptionally sturdy, it seemed insufficient to withstand the Domain's power here; if the Domain were allowed to ravage it, the shield's spirit would surely be greatly diminished.

He had to fully circulate his Saint Yuan to resist the invisible, terrifying pressure around him, and for a time he froze in place, finding it hard to move.

"How is he only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm..." Xu Dingyang stared at Yang Kai in dumbfounded surprise.

When Yang Kai circulated his Saint Yuan, Xu Dingyang naturally detected Yang Kai's true cultivation level and couldn't help but feel somewhat disappointed.

Although the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm differ by only a Stage, the power gap is significant; moreover, this is the Blood Prison, and the warriors who enter here are all Third Stage—upon realizing Yang Kai's cultivation, he felt discouraged.

He thought that with Yang Kai's capabilities, he himself was probably beyond saving.

"Friend, sorry!" Xu Dingyang, while struggling to hold on, kindly warned, "I didn't know you were only Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; otherwise I wouldn't have called for help. You should withdraw now while you can—if you go deeper you won't be able to retreat."

Yang Kai ignored him, continuously increasing the surge of his Saint Yuan, probing the mysteries of the Domain vortex.

To his horror, the Domain vortex seemed to grow stronger when met with strength; no matter how hard he struggled, it continuously suppressed him, making even shifting his feet difficult.

Several wondrous, strange forces wrapped around his body, preventing Yang Kai from discerning their mysteries.

This was the power of a Domain—the unique force of a Void King Realm expert.

"Friend. Use your own Shi to contend with it—when contending with a Domain you can't rely on brute force, or you'll sink deeper!" Xu Dingyang called out loudly.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he quickly followed the advice and released his own Shi.

In an instant, he sensed the solidified space around him loosening, and his Shi became like an invisible blade, cutting into the Domain vortex and becoming the leverage with which to oppose it.

“I’ve learned something—many thanks!” Yang Kai looked up at Xu Dingyang and offered his thanks.

"You're welcome!" Xu Dingyang forced an ugly smile; his forehead was drenched in sweat. The Saint Yuan radiance on his body flickered more rapidly.

During the brief time he spoke with Yang Kai, his situation worsened; he immediately reined in his thoughts, dared not speak further, and devoted himself wholly to seeking a thread of hope inside the terrifying Domain vortex.

Yang Kai's expression grew focused as he poured all his strength into releasing his Shi.

Around him within a radius of three zhang, space began to warp; faint, nearly invisible spatial fissures formed and then vanished.

The pressure on Yang Kai suddenly eased considerably.

A Void King Realm expert's Domain is an evolution of Shi—an arcane force one tier above Shi.

Using Shi to counter the Domain indeed had some effect.

If the Domain were cast by a living Void King Realm expert, even if Yang Kai's Shi had been cultivated to perfection he would likely be unable to resist. But the Domain vortexes here were relics left behind tens of thousands of years ago. Even after the sedimentation and transformations of time, without any living mind controlling them, they were ultimately dead things.

Yang Kai could still barely contend with them.

No wonder the Blood Prison was a place that drew Third-Stage Origin Returning Realm experts like moths to a flame. Despite its countless dangers, it still attracted so many of those powerful cultivators to come and temper themselves.

The Domain vortexes here were the best aids for Third Stage warriors to refine their own Shi.

Warriors could refine their Shi here and strengthen their control over it. By comprehending the marvels of the Domain, once one's Shi was refined to consummation, they would have the capital to launch an assault on the Void King Realm!

This was a height that most Third Stage experts could not reach.

Yang Kai wholeheartedly used his Shi to oppose the surrounding formless Domains; subtle, indescribable sensations flooded his heart, causing him to frown in thought at times and to break into smiles at others, his expression constantly shifting.

Unconsciously, his steps crept forward; though very slow, his body was unwittingly drawing closer to the center of the Domain vortex to seek deeper, more profound secrets.

His control over his Shi seemed to become effortless; the Shi that had originally only covered the three-zhang radius around Yang Kai's body began to subtly expand outward—unobtrusively, but undeniably increasing.

He was completely immersed in this special training, unable to extricate himself.

The warrior called Xu Dingyang, though in dire straits, watched Yang Kai's movements.

When he saw the youth actually step toward him, resisting that terrifying Domain's power with only Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivation, Xu Dingyang was utterly shocked.

He knew better than anyone the lethality of this Domain vortex; he had assumed that with Yang Kai's abilities the youth would withdraw immediately, otherwise certain death awaited.

But this unknown youth not only did not retreat—he attacked toward the center of the Domain vortex.

This world was insane; Xu Dingyang could hardly believe his eyes.

Those who could cultivate to the Third Stage were all proud and supremely skillful; Xu Dingyang himself was the Sect Master of a mid-sized sect, having received excellent upbringing and abundant cultivation resources since youth.

Yet compared to the youth, Xu Dingyang felt inferior.

He felt his confidence had been dealt a severe blow.

While his mind was unsettled, a faint sound suddenly reached his ears.

Xu Dingyang's expression changed; he hurriedly looked toward the source of the sound, and the next moment his face turned pale.

The Secret Treasure he had deployed around his body finally reached its limit; the waterlike curtain split open with a tiny seam, and more fissures were rapidly forming.

"Friend! I fear I cannot escape this calamity. If it's convenient, please take the time to go to Chi Lan Star's Qingyu Sect and tell the elders of Qingyu Sect that I have perished here. Everything in my Spatial Ring is yours as a reward! I beg your favor, friend," Xu Dingyang cried urgently.

Hearing his cry, Yang Kai broke out of his deep contemplation, opened his eyes, and looked at him.

He just saw Xu Dingyang's outer water curtain defense turn to powder; what little Saint Yuan he had left also erupted at that moment, surging outward with all its force.

Although he had already admonished Yang Kai, Xu Dingyang obviously did not want to sit and await death—he wanted to fight one last time.

The light around him fluctuated; his face contorted wildly, and a beastlike low roar issued from his throat.

A sizzling sound rang out as formless Domain power assaulted him from all directions.

Having run less than three paces, Xu Dingyang's body suddenly trembled and froze in place; his skin turned crimson and droplets of blood seeped from his pores.

With a popping sound, Xu Dingyang's entire body exploded—flesh and blood spattered; no bones remained.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; his face was full of horror.

A Third Stage expert had been so miserably killed before his eyes, making him deeply feel the terror of the Domain; at the same time a strange, sympathetic sorrow rose within him.

But he quickly dispelled such distracting thoughts, closed his eyes again, and stepped toward the center.

They were strangers, so he naturally would not be greatly emotionally affected by his death.

Even the Domain vortex that had torn Xu Dingyang apart wouldn’t necessarily be able to make him suffer the same fate. He had that much confidence.

His Shi still shuttled through the surrounding space; Yang Kai comprehended that arcane force, absorbed it, removed the dross and kept the essence, made it his own, and let it become nourishment for his growth.

The waves of murderous force coming from the void did not stop his exploration; he continued to advance step by step.

Without using his Secret Treasures and with only the bare minimum Saint Yuan shielding him, Yang Kai pressed his body close to the Domain vortex, using his Shi to contend with the Domain and directly experience its wonders.

He reaped benefits and gradually immersed himself in them.

Once again the benefits of a powerful body manifested—perhaps no Origin Returning Realm cultivator would dare do this; they could only use their Shi to counter the Domain to gain benefits and thus grow.

This indirect method could not compare to Yang Kai's domineering approach.

Yang Kai not only used Shi but also his own body.

He gained more benefits than any Origin Returning Realm cultivator.

As time passed, at one moment Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes; his body shook and his Shi abruptly expanded outward.

The once oppressive Domain vortex offered no resistance; Yang Kai strode forward and arrived directly at the very center of the vortex.

This was the most terrifying spot of the Domain vortex—Xu Dingyang had also died here; the ground still bore his torn limbs and flesh, the stench of blood so intense it made one nauseous.

Yang Kai stood silently, gradually tempering his Shi, and allowed the surrounding Domain force to press upon him.

The terrifying force made Yang Kai’s bones crack and creak as though they were about to shift out of place. The power of that Domain vortex seemed intent on crushing him into dust.

Multicolored radiance flared as the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi filled every muscle and inch of Yang Kai's skin, instantly boosting his corporeal strength enough to contend with the Domain's might.

Yang Kai's face flushed; blood boiled through his body as if he might burst at any moment.

But his gains began to grow larger and more numerous.

He gleaned subtle mysteries of the Domain and his understanding of Shi deepened.

He was not satisfied; once he ensured his life was secure, he slipped into even deeper comprehension and took pleasure in it.

Yang Kai vaguely felt that this Blood Prison Trial might grant him unimaginable growth.
