## Chapter 2613 — The Young People of Today…

Luan Feng gave a bitter smile at these words, knowing Yang Kai wanted her as a bodyguard. But at this point, she had no way to refuse and could only nod, "You are too polite, Sir Yang. Since that lord instructed us to look after you, I naturally cannot shirk my duty. However, there is one thing you should know: my identity is rather special, so it is inconvenient for me to act too wantonly in a human Sect. Otherwise, I will surely draw the pursuit of the Great Emperors."

Although she was a Divine Spirit, she still held a deep respect for the ten Great Emperors of the humans.

If she were at her peak, she might be able to match the ten Great Emperors, but she had only recently given birth to a daughter a few years ago and had yet to recover her vitality. If she really acted recklessly in a human Sect, she would definitely provoke the Great Emperors' pursuit, and then she would never know peace.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said, “Lady Feng, you’re overthinking it. I’m just going to the Netherworld Sect, not starting a massacre.”

"Heh heh…" Luan Feng chuckled, not sure whether to believe him or not.

"Let's go!" Yang Kai called out, taking Ji Yao with him as he flew out.

Luan Feng did not move. She turned her head and glanced at the dozen or so Netherworld Sect disciples kneeling on the ground. Her beautiful eyes turned cold as she waved her hand and struck out with her palm.

Bang, bang, bang…

A series of muffled booms rang out as the dozen or so Netherworld Sect disciples all exploded into clouds of blood mist, vanishing from the world.

It was not that Luan Feng was bullying the weak, but these fellows had spoken so rudely just now that it truly infuriated her.

After dealing with these remnants of the Netherworld Sect, Luan Feng turned around and chased after Yang Kai.

The dozens of Qi Family Stronghold disciples stood there drenched in sweat. Only after a long while did they gradually come to their senses, realizing that they had been lucky this time and managed to keep their lives.

"Young Stronghold Master, they… they're all gone!" An old man came up to Qi Hai and spoke softly.

Qi Hai collapsed to his knees, his eyes vacant, his face full of bitterness.

…

Luan Feng seemed extremely familiar with the Eastern Territory. According to her, she had often taken human form and traveled throughout the Star Realm, so she was quite well-versed in the geography and terrain of its various regions.

Under her guidance, Yang Kai's group of three arrived in a city called Haicheng City in less than a day.

Once inside the city, the three of them headed straight for the City Lord’s mansion.

The City Lord of Haicheng City only had the cultivation of the First Stage of the Emperor Realm. When he heard that someone had barged into the City Lord’s mansion, he flew into a rage and hurried over from his closed-door cultivation. Before he could even question them, Ji Yao, following Yang Kai’s instructions, released a bit of her pressure, immediately stunning the City Lord in place, leaving him unable to move.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Yang Kai and the other two used the City Lord’s mansion’s Space Array to leave directly.

After the three left, the City Lord finally let out a sigh of relief, his back already drenched in sweat.

Using the same method, after several consecutive teleports, the three finally arrived at the Purgatory City.

"Sir Yang, the Purgatory City is the city closest to the Netherworld Sect and is also one of the Netherworld Sect’s foundations. From here, it will take less than two hours to reach the Netherworld Sect."

After stepping out of the Space Array, Luan Feng explained to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded, "I’ll have to trouble Lady Feng to lead the way."

Luan Feng smiled, "Please follow me."

After spending the past few days together, Luan Feng found that Yang Kai’s temperament was rather gentle and he treated her with courtesy, completely different from his unruly behavior back in the Ancient Land. This put her at ease, knowing that Yang Kai was not the type to act recklessly.

Leaving the City Lord’s mansion, the three of them headed straight for the Netherworld Sect’s headquarters.

Two hours later, a spiritual mountain range appeared ahead. Amidst the rolling mountains stood many pavilions and towers, with numerous cultivators moving about. The area was filled with Spiritual Qi, and it was clear that the Earth Vein here was extraordinary.

However, this place felt different to Yang Kai compared to other spiritual mountain ranges. There was always a chilling, gloomy aura lingering here, likely related to the Netherworld Sect’s cultivation methods.

The disciples of the Netherworld Sect all cultivated sinister arts, and the Secret Treasures they refined were all of a sinister nature. Within the Sect, there was even the bizarre Netherworld Pool, which, after years of accumulation, had turned this spiritual land into a place filled with ghostly energy.

The disciples guarding the mountain gate were merely at the Dao Origin Realm. When the trio flew past, those gatekeepers didn’t even notice their presence.

They probably never imagined that anyone would dare to trespass into the Netherworld Sect without prior notice.

Entering the Netherworld Sect, the group flew forward in an unhurried manner as if no one could stop them. Yang Kai looked around, constantly observing the scenery.

Luan Feng said, "Sir Yang, are you looking for the Netherworld Sect Master, Fu Bo?"

Yang Kai replied, "Yes. Does Lady Feng know where he is?"

Luan Feng shook her head, "I do not. I have never been to the Netherworld Sect before."

"Then we’ll have to find someone to ask."

As the two were speaking, a shout suddenly rang out from not far away, "You there, stop right now!"

Hearing the voice, Yang Kai turned to look and saw a streak of light shooting over. As it drew near, the light dispersed, revealing a man and a woman.

The man looked to be around thirty years old, but his complexion was slightly sallow, his aura weak and unsteady, and a shadow lingered between his brows. His cultivation was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Despite this, he wore ornate robes of fine silk, clearly marking him as someone of considerable status.

The woman had a flirtatious look in her eyes, her cheeks flushed, and her hair slightly disheveled. Her eyes were moist and alluring, and her figure was extremely seductive. Her cultivation was two Stages higher than the man’s, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

As the man and woman approached, a strong, indecent scent drifted over on the wind.

With his vast experience, Yang Kai immediately recognized the smell and, seeing the woman’s sultry gaze, knew exactly what the two had just been up to. He secretly laughed—broad daylight, and yet they still had such enthusiasm.

Who knew at which mountain foot they had just performed their little play.

Luan Feng frowned, "What is that smell!"

Though she had a daughter, Luan Feng had not experienced the union of man and woman as Yang Kai had imagined. Instead, she had condensed a spirit egg within her body using her own Essence-Blood and vitality. When it came to matters between men and women, Luan Feng was still completely innocent and could not comprehend the essence of that scent.

Still, the smell instinctively made her uncomfortable.

"Oh, what an ice-cold beauty!" The young man’s eyes immediately locked onto the cold-faced Ji Yao as soon as he arrived.

Because she cultivated ice-based techniques, many disciples of the Ice Heart Valley lineage had this cold, unapproachable demeanor, keeping others at a distance.

After washing up, Ji Yao no longer looked dirty. Her beauty and graceful figure, combined with her icy aura, easily stirred a man’s desire to conquer.

The young man before them was clearly the type who lusted after women, or else he would not have been so shameless as to fool around with his female companion in broad daylight.

"Scram!" Ji Yao snapped coldly, her face frosty, feeling extremely uncomfortable under his gaze.

"Ha, such a fiery temper. I like it." The young man was thick-skinned. Even though Ji Yao showed no interest, he acted as if he enjoyed it, his eyes shining with a greedy light, his fingers twitching as if he could not wait to get his hands on her. Shameless to the core.

Yang Kai reached out and pulled Ji Yao behind him, smiling as he looked at the young man.

The young man’s face turned cold as he snorted, "Who are you people? You’re not disciples of my Netherworld Sect, are you? Why have I never seen you before?"

Yang Kai replied indifferently, "That’s none of your concern. We’re here to collect a debt from the Netherworld Sect. Tell me, your Sect Master…"

Before Yang Kai could finish, the young man’s eyes suddenly lit up as he stared at Luan Feng, licking his lips, "What a beautiful woman! Hahaha, I’m in luck today. I’ve decided—you’ll be warming my bed tonight!"

Compared to the icy beauty Ji Yao, this young man seemed to prefer the mature charm of a beautiful woman.

His attention had been on Ji Yao before, but now that he noticed Luan Feng, he became excited, his breathing quickening and his eyes filled with lust.

As he spoke, he reached out to grab Luan Feng.

Judging by his action, he clearly intended to seize her by force.

"Are young people these days all like this?" Yang Kai was startled and quickly stepped aside.

"Courting death!" Luan Feng shouted in fury.

With her status, even if the Netherworld Sect Master Fu Bo came, he would have to treat her with utmost respect. Yet this ignorant First Stage Dao Origin Realm youth dared to reach out to her and even utter such obscene words, wanting her to warm his bed at night?

Even a clay figurine has a temper, let alone the Divine Spirit Luan Feng!

As the young man reached for Luan Feng, he glanced at Yang Kai, his eyes showing both contempt and approval, as if to say Yang Kai knew how to read the situation.

He had seen Yang Kai step aside just now and thought it was out of fear, which made his vanity swell. He said, "Little lady, you’d best not resist. My grandfather is the Great Elder. If you follow me, you’ll enjoy endless benefits."

Luan Feng snorted and struck out with her palm.

Before the young man could react, he was blasted into a cloud of blood mist by her palm, leaving not even a corpse behind.

"Ah!" The woman who had come with him instantly turned pale, covering her red lips with her hand, her beautiful eyes trembling violently.

Staring at the falling chunks of flesh and blood, she could not believe her eyes.

Just a moment ago, the grandson of the Great Elder, who had promised her countless benefits at the foot of the mountain, was now dead? He had not even fulfilled his promises—wasn’t she at a loss, having been toyed with for nothing?

Remembering how that pile of flesh and blood had just been writhing and rampaging on her body, the woman’s face turned white. She turned aside and vomited violently, retching until she was dizzy and her eyes spun.
