## Chapter 1243 — Second Stage of the Saint King Realm

In the Fifth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland, in a stone chamber at the bottom of an obscure Earth-Lung Fire Pool, Yang Kai sat with a strange expression, quietly.

Though he looked exhausted and near collapse, there was an excitement and joy he could not hide from his brow, and the Saint Yuan fluctuations slowly emanating from his body clearly signaled a substantial rise in his cultivation.

It had been more than a month since he began refining the Profound Yin Moon Water; only yesterday had he finished.

He had not expected it to take so long, and many unforeseen events had occurred during the process.

The extreme cold contained within the Profound Yin Moon Water was too powerful; the various Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines he had taken earlier, together with the earthfire drawn by the two stone pedestals' seals, could not suppress the water's chill, and his internal hot and cold forces could not reach equilibrium. With no other option, Yang Kai was forced to activate the seal on the third stone pedestal, greatly strengthening the earthfire.

He had intended to use the earthfire's power to balance the Profound Yin Moon Water, but when the third stone pedestal's seal was opened, the Profound Yin Moon Water's force was instead comprehensively suppressed, and the scorching power within him surged.

Yang Kai grimly swallowed the second drop of Profound Yin Moon Water, only to helplessly find the initial situation repeating itself.

In the end he opened the seals on all four stone pedestals; the earthfire's fierce force was drawn in, finally allowing the hot and cold within to barely maintain a state of balance.

But with that came risks and torments that grew almost exponentially; during that long month he teetered on the brink of death several times and nearly failed.

His powerful body and tenacious Divine Sense played decisive roles at the crucial moments. He had to expend several drops of the supreme Golden Blood he had accumulated to mend his injuries, otherwise he could not have held on—he would long ago have been extinguished by the Profound Yin Moon Water and the earthfire.

Though the good thing had many trials, the final result still exceeded Yang Kai's expectations.

Zong Ao had praised the Profound Yin Moon Water to the skies. With none to be found aboveground, Yang Kai had assumed it was extraordinarily potent and had hoped this refinement would thrust him directly to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm or even touch the threshold of the Origin Returning Realm; yet now his cultivation only reached the pinnacle of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Two drops of Profound Yin Moon Water, so many rare Spiritual Herbs and Pills, and the earthfire here—only advanced him a minor Stage.

Although the increase in realm was slight, Yang Kai gained other benefits.

After a moment of thought, Yang Kai opened his hand; a pitch-black Demonic Flame, like a burning orb, hovered above his palm. Outwardly it looked no different than before, but it no longer bore that alternating cold and heat, that mingled aura of right and wrong; to anyone probing with Divine Sense it was merely an oddly sinister ball of flame, without the slightest warmth.

Yet with a motion of his will, that Demonic Flame released a bone-piercing chill; with a series of crackling sounds the entire chamber was instantly shrouded in a layer of frost, a terrifying display as if freezing a thousand li. Even the stone walls were frozen hard and cracking, and the protective seals arranged in the chamber activated on their own, raising layers of light to hinder the spread of the icy profound intent.

Yang Kai shifted his thought again and the bone-chilling cold vanished, replaced by boundless searing heat surging from the Demonic Flame; the frost that had spread dissolved in an instant and disappeared. The fiery force was overwhelmingly fierce, and the chamber's protective seals could not react in time—suddenly with a crack one layer shattered.

A trace of satisfaction crossed Yang Kai's face; with a gentle clap his hand closed and the black orb of Demonic Flame vanished.

He also perceived that because he had refined two full drops of Profound Yin Moon Water, the main reason his cultivation had not risen much was that his Demonic Flame had absorbed most of the energy.

When the Profound Yin Moon Water and various hot forces reached a balance within him, those conflicting energies should have driven his realm to surge, but inside him there was the strange Demonic Flame—also a coexistence of cold and heat—which could accept the effects of the water and the herbs and pills, allowing the Demonic Flame to become even stronger.

From its birth until a month ago, the Demonic Flame had existed in a state of alternating cold and heat, unpredictable and mysterious, and as its owner Yang Kai had been unable to control its shifts.

But now Yang Kai could; as the Demonic Flame's power greatly increased, its affinity with him also improved markedly.

In future combat he could will it to be cold when cold was needed or hot when heat was needed—this controllable Demonic Flame would be far more deadly and threatening than its natural oscillation.

Overall, Yang Kai was quite satisfied with this refinement. From the moment the Demonic Flame was born he had known this strange power possessed great malleability and capacity for growth.

Unfortunately he had never worked out how to foster that growth, and no one could tell him.

This time's fortunate coincidence, however, gave him a method.

As long as hot and cold could be brought into balance to form an external force and then merged into the Demonic Flame, it could be promoted to grow.

It seemed the remaining Profound Yin Moon Water was not useless after all, Yang Kai thought.

He had been pondering what to do with the rest—selling it was out of the question; a treasure invites trouble, and leaving it idle would be a waste.

Now Yang Kai had a good plan.

If he gathered large quantities of yang-attributed, fire-natured Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines, he might refine the Profound Yin Moon Water a second or third time to further empower the Demonic Flame.

Of course, this was only an idea; whether it could be realized remained uncertain.

If time had permitted he would have liked to refine more Profound Yin Moon Water to experiment, but already more than five months had passed since entering the Flowing Flame Sandland and the half-year mark approached, so he had to shelve the plan for another day.

He feared he might never find a refining environment as ideal as this Earth-Lung Fire Pool again; after all, when the Flowing Flame Sandland would next open was anyone's guess.

After sitting in meditation for a day Yang Kai recovered, rose, looked around, removed the four softly glowing spheres embedded in the chamber walls, and tossed them into his Spatial Ring.

Those glowing spheres were certainly not ordinary; placing them at his dwelling would calm the spirit, steady the soul, and improve the environment—he would not pass up such finds.

After confirming nothing was left behind in the chamber, Yang Kai left and followed the long passage outward.

Soon he emerged, stood at the cave mouth, focused on the left entrance, and a cold smile curved his lips.

A month and more earlier he had suffered a heavy loss at the hands of that Artifact Spirit; had he not cultivated spatial power he might have died then. Now that his cultivation had advanced a Stage and he completely controlled the Demonic Flame's hot-and-cold shifts, he naturally intended to take revenge.

He could not deny he desired a Refining Furnace with an Artifact Spirit inside; if possible he wished to subdue it.

But that Artifact Spirit was not to be trifled with; even with some confidence he had to plan carefully, and the duel had to be swift—who knew when the Flowing Flame Sandland might close? It would be disastrous to be teleported away while still locked in combat.

After long hesitation Yang Kai's figure flickered and he charged straight for the opposite cave.

Midair the fire of the Earth-Lung Fire Pool below wrapped around him, its energy visible to the eye and scorching his body. Yang Kai's outer Demonic Flame ignited, sending forth an ice-piercing chill; though it could not completely fend off the blaze, it did not falter.

A pleased expression crossed Yang Kai's face—he immediately knew his Demonic Flame had indeed grown in might. The last time he had come through he had been cautious; this time there was no need for such worry.

In the blink of an eye he reached the left cave and entered as if on familiar ground.

He passed through the several-hundred-zhang passage quickly; the Artifact Spirit remained unresponsive. Only when Yang Kai reappeared in the chamber did the central Refining Furnace hum, its surface glowing red, and the fiery red strange bird cried a sharp call and abruptly burst forth from the furnace.

In an instant the chamber's temperature spiked and everything turned crimson.

The Artifact Spirit clearly bore a grudge; after Yang Kai's escape it had been secretly enraged for over a month, and seeing him charge in again it immediately sought to strike and teach him a lesson.

That suited Yang Kai's intent; his body trembled and a layer of cold Demonic Flame surged up to resist the opponent's scorching breath. At the same time he seized a Heaven-Slaying Spear and hurled it at the crimson fire bird with all his strength.

The crimson fire bird screeched in fury, as if furious at being underestimated; its hooked beak opened and vast waves of flame spewed forth in a towering onslaught toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sneered, showing no intention to dodge; the hurled Heaven-Slaying Spear split a path through the flames, then twisted into a pitch-black jiao, its wide maw belching forth a torrent of icy demonic fire that quelled the heat waves.

After several battles Yang Kai had gained some insight into the Yuan Control Art; he could easily manipulate the Saint Yuan he sent forth, shaping it into varied attacks.

It must be said that the Yuan Control Art he realized through the Red Candle Fruit's maturity had been an enormous aid to his combat power—this single technique alone raised his fighting strength by at least twenty percent.
