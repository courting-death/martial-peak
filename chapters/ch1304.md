## Chapter 1304 — Divergence

With the thunder beast's low roar, the azure clouds in the sky seemed to be pulled by some unseen force; they writhed and rolled, and to everyone's stupefied eyes the clouds warped into an inverted funnel, furiously pouring into the Silver Night Thunder Beast.

In no more than three breaths, that stretch of cloud that had hung over the sky vanished entirely, all sucked into the Silver Night Thunder Beast.

Yang Kai's eyelids tightened and the hair on his body stood on end; although the Silver Night Thunder Beast showed no outward change, he faintly felt a dangerous aura rising from within its body.

At that moment, Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei—who had been waiting for the beast to move so they could dash in and finish it—rushed up to the demonic beast, but before they could unleash any killing moves the Silver Night Thunder Beast suddenly fixed its massive beast-eye on them, a look of almost human disdain and mockery in its gaze.

The next instant, a terrifying pressure burst forth from the Silver Night Thunder Beast as if, having just absorbed the azure clouds, its strength had surged dramatically.

Only then did Wang Yuhan finally sense the danger and bark out, "Not good!"

His body spun swiftly, and in that instant, countless palm-sized, diamond-shaped energy shields shot out from within him, densely surrounding him in protection. At the same time, Shen Fanlei also sensed danger — thunderlight flickered all around his body, forming what seemed like armor woven from lightning itself, making him appear incomparably fierce and imposing.

The Silver Night Thunder Beast, however, treated it all as nothing; with a single blur it transformed into a streak of electricity and vanished from where it stood. In the next moment there was a muffled groan from Wang Yuhan and a roar of anger from Shen Fanlei as both were struck by a great force and hurled from the air.

All of Wang Yuhan's countless rhombic shields burst into powder, and Shen Fanlei's Leiguang armor instantly dimmed. Clearly, both men's faces had turned suddenly pale as they each spat a spray of blood—severely injured.

Down below, Shen Shitao and Lü Ying, who had been itching to move, watched in horror and turned pale; their intent to act was snuffed in an instant and they bolted forward to help, each rushing to check on one of the wounded.

In midair, the beast’s shadow flickered — the Silver Night Thunder Beast that had vanished earlier appeared once more. This time, it cast a cold glance toward Yang Yan, who stood by the Thunder Pool, performing a technique to collect the Thunder Liquid. A flash of anger passed through its beastly eyes, its body swayed slightly — and then it vanished again.

Indeed, after absorbing that stretch of cloud its power had risen substantially.

Yang Yan remained rooted to the spot but instinctively sensed danger; a red radiance shimmered across her skin and a layer of protection formed, only to shatter the moment it appeared. In the void a phantom of the Silver Night Thunder Beast shimmered into being—so fast that Yang Yan could barely perceive it.

Her face paled slightly, but she quickly steadied herself.

Just as the Silver Night Thunder Beast prepared to strike her down, Yang Kai suddenly appeared before Yang Yan with a fist wreathed in Demonic Flame, smashing his blow into the empty air.

A thunderous boom rolled out and a shockwave swept by, sending Yang Kai flying backward; he snatched up the stationary Yang Yan. The vanished Silver Night Thunder Beast reemerged with a low roar, staggering as if it could not stand firm; its massive body lurched backward, its four powerful claws raking visible gouges in the air.

Once it found its footing, it let out an explosive roar. A massive lightning sphere formed in its mouth, and with a toss of its head the sphere surged toward Yang Kai like an unstoppable tide.

Yang Kai's expression turned grave. A strand of golden silk sprang from his fingertips and in an instant spread into a net that enveloped the lightning sphere, slicing at it. Before the sphere could reach him, it ruptured under the external force, spewing countless tiny lightning serpents that dissipated into the heavens.

The golden threads, however, passed through the writhing lightning serpents and drove straight at the Silver Night Thunder Beast like a sharpened sword aimed for its body.

There was a light clang as sparks flared across the beast's scales; the razor-sharp golden thread failed to pierce the Silver Night Thunder Beast's hide, stopped after penetrating less than three inches and lost its momentum.

Yang Kai seemingly expected this. He stared coldly at the Silver Night Thunder Beast and a lotus bud of intent bloomed in his eyes—this beast was extraordinary, and in realm it far exceeded him; to end it swiftly he would have to use his trump card.

The instant the beast saw that lotus, it instinctively sensed danger, its beast-eye filling with alarm. It dared not meet Yang Kai's gaze and, with a blur, plunged into the Thunder Pool and disappeared.

Ripples ran across the Thunder Pool, and calm returned to the place.

That it fled without fighting surprised Yang Kai greatly.

Still, Yang Kai could not help but breathe a sigh of relief; to be honest, he did not want to slug it out with the beast now. Since it chose to retreat, that outcome suited him best—under other circumstances he would not have let a Ninth-Tier thunder beast escape.

Shen Shitao and Lü Ying had only just helped the injured Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei to their feet when they looked over and saw the Silver Night Thunder Beast beating a hasty retreat; the scene left them dumbfounded—they had no idea what Yang Kai had done to force such a demonic beast to withdraw.

The group exchanged looks, all feeling a mixture of astonishment and doubt.

At that moment Yang Yan quietly handed something to Yang Kai and leaned in to whisper a few words into his ear.

Yang Kai listened, glanced over at the pale Wang Yuhan, and a faint smile lifted one corner of his mouth. Wang Yuhan, puzzled by the look, showed no fear; instead his expression turned sullen as he glared back at Yang Kai.

"Brother Yang..." Shen Shitao strolled over and, eyeing the Thunder Pool, asked with some concern, "Is that Silver Night Thunder Beast injured?"

"Not sure, but it withdrew on its own."

Shen Shitao was taken aback, then forced a wry smile. "Seems Brother Yang is quite something—able to frighten off a Silver Night Thunder Beast. I underestimated you."

"You flatter me, Miss Shen. Driving it off wasn't solely my doing—it's thanks to Brother Wang and your brother's efforts. The beast likely knew it couldn't contend with you and chose to retreat," Yang Kai replied lightly, not attempting to claim credit.

"Indeed!" Wang Yuhan cut in without ceremony. "From its behavior just now, it must have employed some secret art to temporarily boost itself, but such techniques carry a heavy price. It only recently advanced to Ninth-Tier and likely cannot bear the backlash, which is why it pulled back."

Hearing this, the others fell to pondering and no one spoke for a long while, tacitly accepting Wang Yuhan's conjecture.

"Brother Wang knows quite a bit about these beasts," Yang Kai remarked with a smile.

"What?" Wang Yuhan furrowed his brow.

"Nothing," Yang Kai waved a hand, then turned to Shen Shitao. "Miss Shen, since the matter here is settled, I shall take my leave."

"Where are you going?" Shen Shitao asked.

"Out of here, of course," Yang Kai answered casually. He noticed Shen Shitao's half-smile and added with a laugh that last time after parting with them they'd been lost here for a long while, but now they'd finally found the right direction and shouldn't get lost again.

After all, Yang Kai had told her before that he'd leave this place, but he'd loitered here for so many days—clearly he hadn't been entirely truthful previously.

Shen Shitao didn't press the matter and instead looked to the others, "Then let's be on our way."

"But my Junior Brother hasn't perfected his secret art yet," Wang Yuhan hesitated, instinctively unwilling to depart with Yang Kai; the offhand remark earlier had put him on guard, unsure if Yang Kai had discovered something.

"With a Ninth-Tier Silver Night Thunder Beast here, one cannot remain to cultivate. Today's escape was luck; lingering longer could invite unforeseen trouble..."

"But that Silver Night Thunder Beast is clearly wounded. With our strength we might well take it down," Wang Yuhan persisted—his eyes still fixed on thoughts of the beast.

Shen Shitao, tempted by the prospect, turned to Yang Kai and asked, "Brother Yang, what do you think? If we stay now, could we slay that Silver Night Thunder Beast?"

Yang Kai frowned slightly; he realized Shen Shitao's question was a veiled invitation—if he joined them she might truly remain to fight. In their thinking, the beast had suffered a severe backlash; if they could force it from the Thunder Pool, perhaps they could kill it.

After considering this, Yang Kai shook his head. "Whether you can kill it I don't know. This place is not somewhere to linger—unexpected things might occur. If Miss Shen trusts me, it's better to leave quickly."

He did not reveal the matter of the Corpse Den, which made his warning sound deliberately mysterious.

Wang Yuhan's face soured and he was about to retort when Shen Shitao nodded. "If Brother Yang insists, then let's be off. Fanlei, your secret art need not be practiced within the Thunder Pool—finding some thunder-attributed Spirit-Grade Pills will do, albeit less effectively. When we reach Black Crow City, I'll help you procure them."

She seemed to place great trust in Yang Kai's judgment.

Shen Fanlei had no objection; naturally he followed his sister's lead.

Shen Shitao smiled brightly at Yang Kai, "In that case, let's leave the valley together—it's safer to have company on the road."

Naturally, Yang Kai could not refuse her request and nodded his agreement on the spot. Though Wang Yuhan was clearly reluctant, with no choice and no support, he could only grit his teeth and go along with it.

Thus the six of them set out together toward the mouth of Zangxiong Valley.
