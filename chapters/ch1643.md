## Chapter 1643 — Heartbroken and Disheartened

Generally speaking, such violent aura is something only those with a fierce temper and ruthless heart possess; the people of Ice Heart Valley cultivate ice techniques and prize a clear mind and few desires — how could any of them possess such a thing?

What's more, these several women all wore icy expressions, said little, and carried an air that warned outsiders to stay away.

They strode straight toward the ice peak and soon arrived before a cave dwelling.

The woman in the lead glanced around as if asking someone, "Is this the place?"

At once a voice answered, "This is the place, no mistake."

The leading woman nodded, then suddenly called out in a clear voice, “Outer Island disciple Qing Ya, are you present!”

The voice was not loud, yet it carried far and cut through the air with sharp clarity.

When Yang Kai heard it, his face lit up; it was as if someone had delivered a pillow to a dozing man — he had been worrying about finding Qing Ya's cave, and now this group had come looking for her.

However… this group of women looked to have come with ill intent! Yang Kai frowned inwardly and did not reveal himself; he remained hidden and watched in secret.

No sooner had the woman's words fallen than, within three breaths, a thin membrane-like barrier outside the cave split open as if a bubble had burst, and from within the cave there emerged a woman in a pristine white dress with a poised, dignified bearing.

Qing Ya! Yang Kai raised a brow, then immediately sensed that something was wrong.

Qing Ya's aura was feeble and her face pale; she seemed to have suffered serious injuries!

Just a few days ago when she returned to Icebound Island she had been fine — how could she suddenly be hurt? And judging by her appearance, it wasn't from a cultivation mishap; it looked rather like… she had been beaten!

Yang Kai's heart filled with boundless puzzlement.

Over there, when Qing Ya stepped out and saw the faces and garb of the arrivals, her expression likewise changed.

She appeared to recognize the woman in the lead.

"So it's Senior Sister Bing Die — does Senior Sister have business with me?" Qing Ya forced herself to keep a calm expression, but the tremor in her voice betrayed her inner fear.

By this time many of Ice Heart Valley's disciples on the ice peak had been roused by Bing Die's summons and had come out one after another to investigate.

Upon seeing the scene before them, they could not help showing looks of alarm.

"It's Senior Sister Bing Die of the Enforcement Hall! Why would she come here, and to look for Junior Sister Qing Ya?"

“This is bad. Could Junior Sister Qing Ya have done something wrong? Otherwise, why would this calamity of a woman come looking for her?”

"It can't be. Qing Ya has always kept to her duty since entering the valley and even recently performed a notable service. How could she have erred?"

"You never know. I heard from a Senior Sister in the inner island that a few days ago Qing Ya somehow incurred the Great Elder's anger and got her into quite a fury."

"I heard that too — apparently a Senior Sister named Zhou Yunxuan even struck and wounded her."

"No way. Qing Ya is close friends with Su Yan; with Su Yan around, who would dare strike her?"

……

In a short while, disciples from all over the ice peak had been roused and streamed out of their cave dwellings, standing at various distances to watch.

Whispered murmurs spread around, but the woman called Bing Die at the head paid them no mind; she looked coldly at Qing Ya and announced in a low voice, "Qing Ya, you, as a disciple of Ice Heart Valley who was nurtured by the Sect, not only show no gratitude but have colluded with outsiders, shaking the foundation of Ice Heart Valley. By order of the elders, from today forth Qing Ya is to be stripped of her cultivation, expelled from Ice Heart Valley, and forever forbidden to set foot on Icebound Island!"

That pronouncement stirred a thousand waves; Bing Die's words sent the disciples of the ice peak into an uproar. Exclamations rang out and many of the girls covered their mouths, looking at Qing Ya with shock and sympathy as their beautiful eyes trembled violently.

To expel someone from Ice Heart Valley and strip them of their cultivation — this was the harshest punishment the valley could deliver; it inspired more fear than death.

Death is but an instant, but to be stripped of one's cultivation and expelled from Ice Heart Valley is to live a lifetime in an unimaginable shadow — an indelible stain.

Qing Ya's delicate body trembled; astonishment filled her eyes and her already poor complexion turned paler as she asked in a quavering voice, "Senior Sister Bing Die, what is the meaning of this?"

The charge of colluding with outsiders and undermining Ice Heart Valley's foundation was no casual accusation. Qing Ya knew she had not done anything to harm the Sect; not long ago she had even received praise from the Valley Lord for leading Yang Kai to them — how had she suddenly fallen into this plight?

Bing Die had come unannounced and delivered such a devastating proclamation; Qing Ya simply could not accept it.

"You know full well what's happened!" Bing Die said coldly to Qing Ya, showing no intention of explaining. "Will you strip yourself of your cultivation, or shall Senior Sister do it for you? I'll warn you — if you do it yourself it may be easier; if I do it, I won't hold back and you may be injured!"

"Senior Sister Bing Die!" Qing Ya ground her teeth and cried out; terror flickered with fierce resistance in her eyes. "Junior Sister has never harmed the Sect nor colluded with outsiders, nor undermined Ice Heart Valley's foundation. I do not accept this — I want to see the Great Elder! I want to see the Valley Lord!"

Being branded with such a filthy accusation, Qing Ya could never admit to it; yet in her heart she had vague suspicions.

The so-called collusion with outsiders could only mean her association with Yang Kai.

It was because of her that Yang Kai had been able to come to Icebound Island.

And shaking Ice Heart Valley's foundation, put bluntly, likely meant interfering with Su Yan's cultivation. Su Yan had long been viewed by Ran Yunting as the valley's future; interfering with her training could indeed be called undermining the valley's foundation.

Only… the same facts, when spoken differently, could carry an entirely different meaning.

The Enforcement Hall had probably acted on orders from Ran Yunting.

"You will not see the elders nor the Valley Lord. Today, this matter is decided by me! I'll give you ten breaths to decide!" Bing Die remained unmoved, her eyes on Qing Ya.

Qing Ya's face suddenly drained of color; her heart went cold.

She was only a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm — how could she possibly resist the entire Enforcement Hall?

If she resisted, then perhaps today and here would become her burial ground. Qing Ya had heard of the Enforcement Hall sisters' methods.

Qing Ya forced a bitter smile; the cold wind bit through her, and she felt colder in spirit than in body.

When she first entered Ice Heart Valley she had been full of joy and felt the heavens favored her, having met the benefactor Ran Yunting in her darkest hour. Once inside the Sect she dutifully performed her responsibilities and obeyed every order.

She had never relied on Su Yan's identity or status to benefit herself, though she could have and had the qualifications.

She only wanted to rely on her own effort to grow stronger; she need not match Su Yan, but at the very least she did not want to bring Su Yan shame. After all, they hailed from the same homeland and entered Ice Heart Valley at the same time; if Qing Ya fell too far behind, gossip would follow.

A few days ago Ran Yunting had scolded her without mercy, and that Senior Sister Zhou Yunxuan had struck and wounded her; Qing Ya bore no complaint and quietly returned to the outer island to close herself off and heal.

She knew her actions at the time had been somewhat rash; the blame did not lie with outsiders.

But Bing Die's declaration today came like a thunderclap and left her utterly desolate.

The Great Elder intended to utterly drive her out!

She was merely an outer island disciple, low in status — only known for being acquainted with Yang Kai. For that, the Great Elder would not spare her? And on top of that, they slapped her with such a monstrous charge.

Colluding with outsiders, undermining Ice Heart Valley's foundation…

Qing Ya's beautiful eyes dimmed and the look of resistance slowly faded.

"You have three breaths left to decide!" Bing Die said coldly.

Qing Ya tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, offered Bing Die a measured salute, and softly said, "Senior Sister, I beg one favor."

Bing Die frowned and glanced at her, then said lightly, "Speak."

“Do not let Su Yan learn of what happened today. If she asks about me later, tell her that Qing Ya has gone out to temper herself through training.”

“No need for you to worry about Su Yan—the Great Elder will give her an explanation,” Bing Die sneered. “Do you think invoking Su Yan’s name will spare you from punishment? The Enforcement Hall’s orders are absolute. Even if Su Yan were to find out, she wouldn’t be able to stop what’s happening today.”

She clearly suspected Qing Ya of ulterior motives and brought up Su Yan's name to cow them into caution.

"I meant no such thing," Qing Ya said with a bitter smile.

"Time's up. Your decision!" Bing Die issued her final ultimatum.

"Then let Senior Sister strike!" Qing Ya slowly closed her eyes.

After years of cultivation to reach her current standing, Qing Ya could not bear to destroy her own cultivation.

"As you wish!" A cold light flickered in Bing Die's eyes as she raised a palm toward Qing Ya.

Frost rolled about that palm, containing a devastating destructive power.

Exclamations rose around them and countless disciples of Ice Heart Valley watched with trembling eyes.

Many frowned in secret, their faces showing reluctance and pity.

Their strength allowed them to see that Bing Die's palm was not only meant to strip Qing Ya of her cultivation but could very well kill her with one strike!

Even if Qing Ya survived, with wounds so grave she would be worse than an ordinary person and unable to fend for herself.

Saddened, some turned their heads, unwilling to watch the cruel scene.

Bing Die's eyes were like ice, seemingly devoid of human feeling, only cold cruelty.

"Hm?" Suddenly Bing Die cried out.

When her palm was a foot from Qing Ya, her vision blurred — another figure had suddenly appeared in front of Qing Ya.

That figure seemed to lazily raise a palm and it landed directly against Bing Die's own.

In the next instant Bing Die's face drained of color as an unimaginable, terrifying force struck from directly ahead, not only shattering her attack but also shattering the Saint Yuan within her until it collapsed in ruin.

Bing Die's body flipped like a kite with its strings cut and she was flung backward through the air. Spitting blood uncontrollably, she crashed down onto the snow.

With a heavy thud she slammed into the snow and slid back more than ten zhang before barely coming to a stop.
