## Chapter 1990 — Tailor-Made

Yang Kai felt regretful and pained for the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, when suddenly a flash of insight surged through his mind and an idea that thrilled him arose.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Art could devour things in the world that possessed spirit and convert them for its own use.

The Stone Puppet race's innate divine ability allowed them to devour and refine various minerals, stripping away the dross to retain the essence and thereby strengthen themselves.

In some respects, the two had astonishing similarities...

Moreover, Stone Puppets were not flesh-and-blood; in terms of adaptability and endurance, what living beings in the world could rival them? Take Xiaoxiao for example—it could even devour and smelt the Sun's True Essence, let alone other things.

What would happen if the Stone Puppet race cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art?

Generally speaking, the Stone Puppet race could not cultivate any techniques, because although they were uniquely gifted and extremely powerful, their intellect was too low to comprehend the subtleties of any method, let alone cultivate one.

The Creator was exceedingly fair: He granted the Stone Puppet race sturdy bodies and tremendous destructive power, even a very high potential for growth, but erased most of their spiritual intelligence.

If the Stone Puppet race also possessed high intelligence, they would inevitably become a race comparable to the Ancient Divine Spirit, and every member would be so—this would be a truly terrifying prospect.

But... Yang Kai had an Incarnation!

The Incarnation had originally been transformed from a golden Stone Puppet, merged with the entire Floating Continent, and served as the resting place for a strand of Yang Kai's Soul Incarnation; the Incarnation was effectively Yang Kai's second body!

The fact that the Stone Puppet race could not cultivate techniques did not mean the Incarnation could not.

Thinking this, Yang Kai's blood began to boil. He suddenly realized that the Incarnation possessed such an inherent cultivation advantage, when it came to the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

He hurriedly moved his Divine Sense, withdrew the strand of Soul Incarnation stored within the Incarnation, and poured the Heaven Devouring Battle Art and many of his prior insights into the Soul Incarnation, then in a flash he arrived where the Incarnation resided.

The Soul Incarnation shot forth again and surged into the enormous, mountain-like body.

Immediately the Incarnation struck an extremely strange posture, its expression solemn. It began to cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

At first there was no abnormality, but as time passed, cracking noises emanated from within the vast body and Yang Kai was slightly startled. He at first thought cultivation had gone awry, but after carefully probing the Soul Incarnation's state he found that was not the case.

The cracking continued, followed by rustling sounds. Vast, rock-like masses fell from the Incarnation; when they struck the ground they turned to dust and scattered.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened and he could not help but grin.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Art was indeed extraordinary; it was practically a supreme method tailor-made for the Stone Puppet race!

Those things falling from the Incarnation were all impurities and useless matter whose energies had been devoured. The Incarnation had once fused with the entire Floating Continent and for years had been using the Stone Puppet race's innate divine power to refine it; unfortunately progress had been very slow, so it remained enormous and cumbersome.

For this reason Yang Kai had never thought to deploy the Incarnation in battle.

Its body was too huge; drawing it out of the Xuan Realm Pearl consumed considerable Divine Sense power. Yang Kai would not use it unless absolutely necessary.

Judging by the previous pace, Yang Kai estimated it would take at least ten to twenty years for the Incarnation to gradually shrink to a height of a dozen or so zhang, and only then could he freely employ it.

But by the time that happened, Yang Kai's strength would certainly have far surpassed its present level—what assistance could an Incarnation comparable to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm then provide?

In truth Yang Kai had long been troubled by the Incarnation but had no good solution, and could only leave it be.

Now, however, the Heaven Devouring Battle Art seemed able to resolve this issue.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Art, paired with the Stone Puppet race's innate divine power, caused the Incarnation's rate of impurity refinement to surge. Countless discarded impurities fell from the Incarnation, the essence remained, and the shell of the Incarnation's body seemed to be stripped away.

Perhaps before long the Incarnation could become another great aid in Yang Kai's hands.

And that was not all!

What thrilled Yang Kai most was that the Incarnation now possessed a method it could cultivate to grow stronger. The Stone Puppet race could not cultivate techniques and only strengthened themselves by devouring minerals with their innate divine power.

Xiaoxiao had grown up in precisely that way.

Now the Incarnation not only possessed the Stone Puppet race's innate divine power but also had the Heaven Devouring Battle Art assisting it; with both working together, so long as materials were supplied, its strength could increase dramatically in a very short time.

Drip, drip...

At the place where the Incarnation stood a meteor-shower began to fall; innumerable impurities peeled away and quickly piled into a thick layer on the ground.

With a Soul Incarnation presiding over the Incarnation's cultivation, Yang Kai need not trouble himself to pay it much heed.

So Yang Kai soon settled nearby to cultivate in peace, concentrating on converting his Origin Qi.

His reservoir of starlight had now been exhausted, and if he wished to hasten the conversion of his Origin Qi, he could only turn to Origin Condensing Pills.

Although their effect was slower than starlight, the Origin Condensing Pills Yang Kai refined were of excellent quality, so they were still decent; and for some reason he consumed them much faster than ordinary Void King Realm practitioners.

An ordinary Third Stage of the Void King Realm martial artist, upon taking an Origin Condensing Pill, could train for about three days, meaning the pill's efficacy would persist throughout those three days.

But Yang Kai went through one in a single day.

He thought it over and could only attribute it to his Star Lord body. Perhaps the Star Lord body converted Origin Qi more rapidly than that of an ordinary Void King Realm, hence the greater consumption of Origin Condensing Pills.

Yet this was fortunate for him: he needn't worry about Origin Condensing Pills now—when he used them up he could simply refine more. His most pressing task was to complete the conversion of his Origin Qi as quickly as possible, raise his combat power, and reach the Dao Origin Realm.

Time flew and seven days passed.

Yang Kai stepped out of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

With a sweep of his Divine Sense he immediately sensed that someone had disturbed the wards of his cave; after probing a little farther out, Yang Kai couldn't help but frown, produced his identity plaque, and sealed all the protections.

Outside the cave a man dressed as a shop attendant waited anxiously, clutching a Transmission Compass and seemingly communicating with someone; while he fretted he suddenly heard Yang Kai's voice: "Come in."

The attendant was taken aback, then overjoyed; he hastily pushed open the door and entered.

"Greetings, Pill Master Yang!" the attendant quickly saluted.

"No need for formalities. Is Shopkeeper Kang the one who sent you? What is it?" Yang Kai asked as he looked at him.

The attendant turned out to be an assistant from the Spiritual Pill workshop whom Yang Kai had seen several times, so he recognized him.

"The Shopkeeper said that once you came out you should go to the workshop; he has matters to discuss."

"Shopkeeper Kang has returned?"

Yang Kai knew that Kang Siran had been invited by the city lord's mansion to accompany them to Yuqing Mountain to investigate where Luan Feng had appeared, but that place was now engulfed in black flames and would yield nothing.

Counting the time, it was about when he should have returned.

"The Shopkeeper returned the day before yesterday. Pill Master Yang, if you have nothing else, why not come with me to the workshop to meet him? He's urged it many times already," the assistant said with a smiling face.

"Very well, I'll go now." Yang Kai nodded.

He did not know why Kang Siran was so eager to see him, but he knew something must have happened; otherwise the assistant would not have lingered at his cave door.

There was nothing to prepare, so Yang Kai immediately left his cave and, accompanied by the assistant, hurried to the Spiritual Pill workshop.

Before long they entered the workshop and Kang Siran immediately pulled Yang Kai into a private chamber.

Seeing Kang in a secretive mood, Yang Kai could not help but ask suspiciously, "What is Shopkeeper Kang up to?"

Kang Siran chuckled and said, "Pill Master Yang, there's good news."

"What good news?"

"The Star Envoy will bestow us with an opportunity—wouldn't you say that's good news?"

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai frowned; Kang's vague words made it hard to understand.

"Here's the situation." Kang Siran poured a cup of tea for Yang Kai and said, "In three days, the Star Envoy will open the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda in Fenglin City!"

"The Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda?" Yang Kai was even more puzzled. "What is that?"

Kang Siran's mouth gaped in surprise that Yang Kai had never heard of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, but recalling Yang Kai's previous ignorance he relaxed and patted his head, saying, "Kang was at fault for not explaining it clearly—Pill Master Yang, forgive me."

Yang Kai felt sheepish; knowing Kang was saving him face, he remained silent and watched him seriously.

"The Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda is an Imperial Treasure!"

"An Imperial Treasure?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Indeed, and among Imperial Treasures it is a very high-grade existence," Kang Siran smiled, pleased by Yang Kai's reaction. "But... the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda is very special; it possesses neither offensive nor defensive capability."

"If it neither attacks nor defends, then what is it for? Used for cultivation?" Although Yang Kai knew little of the Star Realm, he understood that secret treasures generally served for offense or defense, so if neither, then cultivation seemed likely.

"More or less so," Kang Siran chuckled. "The Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda is used for tempering, and ordinarily only cultivators of the Star God Palace qualify to enter its trials."

"From what Shopkeeper Kang says... does the interior of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda form its own realm?" Yang Kai immediately considered that possibility.

Kang Siran looked at Yang Kai in astonished admiration and said, "Pill Master Yang is indeed sharp and quick-thinking. Correct—the interior of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda does form its own realm, and it is an extremely profound one."
