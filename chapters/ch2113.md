## Chapter 2113 — The Ethereal Jade Disc’s Reaction

When Yang Kai returned to the Zhang Family and pushed open the door to the guest room, he saw Zhang Ruoxi sitting there with a foolish look, as if she were about to burst into tears.

Hearing the sound, Zhang Ruoxi looked up, her beautiful eyes bursting with joy. She hurriedly stood up, flustered, and said, “Sir…”

Yang Kai glanced at her and smiled, “What’s wrong? Did you think I’d leave the Zhang Family behind and go off on my own, so you’re sitting here crying?”

Zhang Ruoxi pressed her red lips together and slowly shook her head.

“Then why are you crying?” Yang Kai asked.

Zhang Ruoxi spoke softly, “Since Ruoxi has already followed Sir, I have nothing more to do with the Zhang Family… I just thought, Sir… didn’t want me anymore.” At this, she suddenly gathered her courage, looked up at Yang Kai, and said in a low voice, “Sir, Ruoxi knows her strength is low and she can’t help you. Instead, you’ve always been taking care of me. But… Ruoxi can serve tea, make your bed, do chores for you, I can be a maid…”

After saying this, she seemed shocked that she could say such things, quickly lowered her head, her pretty face flushing red, and gave a hurried bow, saying, “Ruoxi was rude, Sir, please rest.”

As soon as she finished, she turned to leave.

“Don’t be in such a hurry to go!” Yang Kai suddenly called out to her.

Zhang Ruoxi’s delicate body trembled, and she stood there anxiously, her voice trembling, “S-Sir, do you have any instructions?”

No one knew what she was thinking, but she looked tense and uneasy, as if sitting on pins and needles. Her small hands twisted together at her abdomen, her face as red as fire. The sound of her heart beating like war drums came from her little chest.

Yang Kai looked at her seriously and said, “Don’t underestimate yourself. Since I promised the Madam to bring you with me, there are naturally things I need your help with!”

“Things I can help with?” Zhang Ruoxi’s eyes lit up at his words, and she asked eagerly, “Sir, what do you want me to do? Can you tell me?”

Yang Kai smiled, “I was originally going to wait until your strength improved a bit more before telling you, but since you’re so eager… it’s fine to tell you now.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai took from his Spatial Ring the Ethereal Jade Disc he had obtained from Lu Baichuan.

The moment the Ethereal Jade Disc appeared, Zhang Ruoxi’s delicate body trembled. She stared fixedly ahead and murmured, “This feeling…”

At this moment, the Ethereal Jade Disc seemed to be activated by some presence, continuously emitting ripples of spatial force, causing the surrounding space to become chaotic, as if it might sink into the void.

Lu Baichuan was right. Zhang Ruoxi really was the key to triggering a reaction from the Ethereal Jade Disc. As long as she was within a certain range, the disc would emit mysterious power.

It was for this reason that Lu Baichuan was able to get started with spatial power.

He had racked his brains to eliminate the Zhang Family’s living members, and then arranged Zhang Ruoxi's marriage into the Lu Family. That way, he would have plenty of opportunities to study the Ethereal Jade Disc in the future, and might even use its spatial power to further his own strength.

Yang Kai waved his hand, and the power of space laws surged, sealing off the entire room and isolating any fluctuations.

“Can you feel anything?” Yang Kai looked at Zhang Ruoxi and asked.

“Ruoxi can’t say for sure,” Zhang Ruoxi slowly shook her head, “but… this feeling is very familiar. When I visited the Lu Family before, I often felt this way, as if something in the Lu Family was calling to me. That’s exactly how it feels now, only much stronger than before!”

Yang Kai nodded, thinking to himself that the connection between Zhang Ruoxi and the Ethereal Jade Disc should be mutual.

“Do you recognize this item?” Yang Kai asked.

Zhang Ruoxi slowly shook her head.

“I got this from Lu Baichuan,” Yang Kai said.

“Uncle Lu’s item?” Zhang Ruoxi said in surprise.

Even though Lu Baichuan was the Zhang Family’s mortal enemy, Zhang Ruoxi still addressed him properly, showing how pure and kind-hearted this little girl was.

“But according to Lu Baichuan, this item originally belonged to your Zhang Family,” Yang Kai continued. “It seems that a woman from your family took it as her dowry when she married into the Lu Family.”

“If it was a dowry, then it should count as the Lu Family’s now,” Zhang Ruoxi said with a slight smile.

Yang Kai said, “No matter whose it is, its origin lies with your Zhang Family. Did your ancestors… ever produce any remarkable figures?”

Zhang Ruoxi shook her head, “Ruoxi doesn’t know, but when I was little, I heard my grandmother say that the Zhang Family used to be a top family a long time ago, but for some unknown reason, it gradually declined.”

“That makes sense,” Yang Kai nodded.

“But… why do I have this strange connection with it? What about the other members of the Zhang Family?” Zhang Ruoxi asked in confusion.

“The others probably don’t. As for why it’s you…” Yang Kai paused, then said, “There are two possibilities. One is that you possess a bloodline power stronger than the other members of the Zhang Family, so you can resonate with this Ethereal Jade Disc. This bloodline power should come from the disc’s original owner, one of your ancestors!”

“What’s the other possibility?”

“That you have some special constitution!” Yang Kai looked at Zhang Ruoxi and slowly shook his head, “But I personally don’t think that’s likely, because after observing you for many days, you don’t seem to have any special constitution!”

“So the first possibility is more likely?” Zhang Ruoxi followed up.

“Exactly.” Yang Kai smiled, “Bloodline power is hard to explain. Maybe your bloodline is very similar to that ancestor’s, so you can sense the Ethereal Jade Disc.”

“Oh!” Zhang Ruoxi responded, not showing much reaction.

“You’re not happy?” Yang Kai asked with interest.

Zhang Ruoxi frowned, “Why do you ask, Sir?”

Yang Kai smiled, “It looks like you don’t know anything. Let me put it this way: your bloodline power is very similar to that ancestor’s, and now that the Ethereal Jade Disc has acknowledged you to some extent, your future achievements may be on par with that ancestor!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly grew solemn as he continued, “The Ethereal Jade Disc is no ordinary item. To be its master, one must at least be an Emperor Realm expert!”

Hearing this, Zhang Ruoxi finally understood, her expression changing, “Sir, do you mean… Ruoxi might one day become an Emperor Realm expert?”

Yang Kai nodded.

“That’s wonderful!” Zhang Ruoxi’s face was full of joy. “If that’s true, then I’ll definitely be able to help you, Sir.”

Yang Kai was stunned by her words.

Upon learning that she might become an Emperor Realm expert in the future, the first thing she thought of was helping him.

This warmed Yang Kai’s heart.

“Sir, can I take a look at this?” Zhang Ruoxi looked at Yang Kai eagerly, then glanced at the Ethereal Jade Disc in his hand.

Since this item concerned her future, she immediately became interested.

“I was going to let you see it anyway,” Yang Kai smiled and handed over the Ethereal Jade Disc.

To be honest, ever since he obtained the Ethereal Jade Disc, he had studied it several times but found nothing. He only knew it had been refined with great divine ability and should be a Secret Treasure, but he didn’t know how to use it.

He was proficient in spatial force and had even mastered the Laws of Space, yet even he was helpless before the Ethereal Jade Disc. If anyone could unravel its mysteries, it had to be Zhang Ruoxi!

Zhang Ruoxi took it excitedly.

What happened next surprised them both.

The moment the disc touched Zhang Ruoxi, it trembled violently and burst forth with a powerful wave of energy.

At the same time, Zhang Ruoxi’s delicate body shuddered as if struck by a surge of electricity.

Buzz…

A strange sound rang out, and brilliant streams of light swept across the previously motionless surface of the Ethereal Jade Disc.

Next, a series of bizarre images shot out from the disc like projections, filling the entire room and swirling around Zhang Ruoxi and the disc.

Yang Kai’s expression turned grim as he looked over; though the images flickered extremely fast, he could still make out quite a few.

Pavilions and towers, misty mountains, jagged rocks, towering peaks, spirit cranes soaring, flocks of birds gathering, mountain springs tinkling, beautiful waters and bright peaks…

Each scene seemed to be taken from a paradise on earth, making one dizzy and enchanted, reluctant to look away.

Yang Kai was stunned.

At that moment, Zhang Ruoxi suddenly let out a soft cry, her aura rapidly weakening, her face twisted in pain. At the same time, a mysterious spatial force surged through the room.

Yang Kai vaguely saw a pitch-black Void Passage slowly forming in the center of the room, but it was very unstable.

Inside the passage was utter nothingness, and no one knew where it led.

“Let go!” Yang Kai shouted, urging his Origin Qi and mobilizing the laws of space to suppress the formation of the Void Passage. At the same time, he lunged forward, snatched the Ethereal Jade Disc from Zhang Ruoxi’s hands.

All the images in the room vanished instantly, and the Void Passage in the center of the room collapsed and disappeared.

Zhang Ruoxi let out a soft groan and collapsed weakly to the ground.

Yang Kai’s expression changed dramatically!

He never expected that simply letting Zhang Ruoxi hold the Ethereal Jade Disc would cause such a thing. If he had known, he would never have taken such a risk.

Putting away the Ethereal Jade Disc, Yang Kai bent down and picked up Zhang Ruoxi, only to find his hands sticky.

In that brief moment, Zhang Ruoxi’s entire body had been drenched in sweat.

After settling her on the bed, Yang Kai placed his hand on her wrist, sending Origin Qi through her body. His face grew extremely grim.

He discovered that much of Zhang Ruoxi’s vitality had been drained, leaving her severely weakened. Though she was just a teenage girl, her body now seemed no different from someone who had lived for decades.

Such fundamental damage could not be healed by ordinary Spiritual Pills. If left unchecked, Zhang Ruoxi’s body would rapidly age.
