## Chapter 2563 — Third Disciple

Faced with this kind of person, Yang Kai truly had no temper to speak of. If her mind were clear, he could sit down and chat, ask about her origins and background, but she acted completely mad, and any conversation depended on her giving him the chance.

Yang Kai ground his teeth in anger, but he dared not startle her.

This madwoman came and went without a trace, her concealment technique was bizarre, and if he scared her off, it would be hard to find her again.

Steadying himself, Yang Kai forced a smile onto his face, doing his best to appear harmless, and beckoned forward, saying, "Come here!"

The madwoman was completely unmoved, only grinning mischievously and repeating, "Come catch me!"

She kept repeating the same line, seemingly never tiring of it.

Yang Kai tried calling out several times, but it had no effect, leaving him helpless.

"Sir, try tempting her with something, see if she'll come over," Zhang Ruoxi suggested suddenly.

Yang Kai thought it was a good idea, so he rummaged through his Spatial Ring and quickly found a bright red fruit. He had plenty of alchemy materials on hand, most acquired through killing and looting, and some from the ancient medicine garden last time.

This Bisha Fruit was at least an Imperial-Grade alchemy material, with an impressive appearance and plenty of age. As soon as it was taken out, it released a fragrant aroma.

Yang Kai flipped his hand, displaying the Bisha Fruit in his palm, and said, "I'll give you something to eat, come here, don't be afraid."

He looked like a shady uncle trying to lure a little girl, feeling disgusted with himself, but still had to act as if nothing was wrong.

The madwoman hanging from the tree was clearly interested in the fruit. Her bright eyes locked onto it, openly showing her desire, and she even smacked her lips a few times, looking eager to eat.

But perhaps by nature, she remained extremely cautious. Despite her obvious longing, she didn't rush over as Yang Kai hoped.

Rustle, rustle...

The leaves shook, and the madwoman suddenly vanished.

Yang Kai froze, quickly releasing his Divine Sense to try to track her. If she escaped this time, searching this vast ancient land would be like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Rustle, rustle...

Another sound came from the other side. Yang Kai turned his head and saw the madwoman reappear on a branch of another large tree, holding the trunk with one hand and standing quietly.

Fast! So fast!

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. He finally experienced her speed—he hadn't even managed to lock onto her, and she had already reappeared like a ghost.

This time, the distance seemed much closer than before.

Yang Kai secretly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing the fruit in his hand had caught her interest.

Yang Kai smiled gently, softly offering the fruit forward, "Do you want it? If not, I'll eat it myself."

As he spoke, he withdrew the fruit and slowly brought it to his mouth.

Seeing this, the madwoman grew anxious, looking as if she wanted to rush over and snatch it, but hesitated, pacing back and forth on the tree trunk without coming down.

Yang Kai, frustrated, steeled himself and took a bite of the Bisha Fruit.

With one bite, his mouth filled with saliva. After all, this was an Imperial-Grade spirit fruit, its spiritual energy was astonishing, and the taste was excellent. The enticing aroma grew even stronger.

Smack, smack...

Yang Kai ate with relish, making strange noises as he did, further tempting the madwoman.

She glanced at the Bisha Fruit again. Determination flashed in her beautiful eyes, and she suddenly turned, transforming into a streak of white light that shot toward Yang Kai like lightning.

Yang Kai had been waiting for this moment. He wouldn't miss it—he threw the spirit fruit at her and reached out, his arm like a dragon, grabbing at the void.

In a flash, the madwoman appeared not far in front of Yang Kai, her shining eyes fixed on the Bisha Fruit he had thrown, as if nothing else in the world could attract her attention.

The spirit fruit flew toward her, and barring accidents, would hit her forehead.

Yang Kai's throw wasn't meant to harm her, but he infused it with some Emperor Yuan, intending to disrupt her and make his next move easier.

Unexpectedly, at the critical moment, the madwoman leaned back, narrowly dodging the fruit, then opened her mouth and bit it, her brows curving into crescent moons, unable to hide her joy.

In that instant, Yang Kai flashed to her side and grabbed her arm.

The madwoman was startled, quickly turning to look at Yang Kai. A chilling light flashed in her always-smiling eyes.

Her body twisted as if it was boneless, shifting in an instant until she stood face-to-face with Yang Kai.

She raised her hand, the other palm fiercely striking at Yang Kai. Even before the attack landed, an extremely cold profound intent spread in all directions, as if to freeze the world.

Yang Kai sucked in a cold breath, shivering involuntarily, and shouted, "Ice Laws!"

If he had only suspected before that this madwoman was related to the Ice Heart Valley's long-missing Third Disciple, now he was almost certain.

All disciples of the Ice Heart Valley cultivated ice techniques.

Yang Kai's expression grew serious. He dared not be careless, and struck back with his own palm, Spatial Laws surging within.

Boom...

A loud noise rang out, both their bodies shook violently, like two small boats tossed in a storm. The two different Law Powers clashed, evenly matched.

The madwoman's cultivation was a Stage higher than Yang Kai's, and she attacked in anger, while Yang Kai responded hastily. Being able to fight her to a draw was his limit—any other First Stage Emperor would suffer greatly.

Before their Law Powers could determine a winner, the madwoman twisted her arm, the hand Yang Kai held suddenly becoming soft as if boneless, snakelike, slipping out of his grasp.

Yang Kai was shocked. When he reached for her again, it was already too late. After being startled once, the madwoman retreated rapidly, instantly widening the distance between them.

Huff, huff...

Only now did their Law Powers subside. Yang Kai stood with a bitter smile, not daring to act rashly for fear of scaring her. Twenty zhang away, the madwoman stood angrily, her eyes full of resentment, as if Yang Kai had abandoned her, making him feel embarrassed.

Tricking someone with a mental problem, especially a woman, was hardly an honorable thing.

Taking the spirit fruit from her mouth, the madwoman bit into it, not caring that Yang Kai had already chewed it, eating happily, her face full of smiles, nose and eyes scrunched up.

Yang Kai sighed softly. She was Bing Yun's Third Disciple, a Second Stage Emperor expert, yet now she was like this—a single spirit fruit brought her the greatest happiness. If the people of Ice Heart Valley saw her, they'd be heartbroken.

Yang Kai quietly signaled to Zhang Ruoxi, who understood and quickly took out a fruit from her own Spatial Ring, gently saying, "Do you want more? I have one too, I'll give it to you if you want."

The madwoman glanced over, her expression changing, waving her hand repeatedly.

After Yang Kai's actions, she was like someone bitten by a snake, now afraid of even a rope.

Not only that, she turned and ran off in a panic.

Yang Kai grew anxious, regretting his earlier haste. He hadn't understood her abilities and ended up startling her.

In fact, before making a move, he was quite confident. With his current strength, capturing a Second Stage Emperor shouldn't be difficult, but Third Disciple's reactions and adaptability exceeded his expectations.

Thinking carefully, she had survived wandering outside for so long, and even longer in the Wild Ancient Land. Without some skill, she'd have been a pile of bones by now.

By now, her strength likely surpassed even that of her First and Second Senior Sisters. Although An Ruoyun and Sun Yunxiu were also at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, neither had faced as many dangers as she had. The hardships the Third Disciple endured far exceeded theirs.

Danger and hardship are always stepping stones for growth.

Seeing the madwoman about to escape, Yang Kai dared not hesitate, shouting, "Third Disciple, Senior Bing Yun is waiting for you to return, where are you running!"

He didn't know Third Disciple's real name, nor had he asked before, so he just called out, mentioning Bing Yun's name, unsure if it would work.

If this madwoman really was Bing Yun's Third Disciple, even with a confused mind, she wouldn't be indifferent.

To Yang Kai's delight, upon hearing his shout, the madwoman froze, her body trembling, her dark face slowly turning, forgetting to swallow the spirit fruit in her mouth.

Their eyes met, and Yang Kai saw confusion in her eyes. Bing Yun's name had stirred some memories, but her current state prevented them from becoming clear. Amidst the chaos, a hint of struggle and pain appeared on her face.

She must be the Third Disciple! Yang Kai was certain, and gently said, "Third Disciple, Senior Bing Yun has returned. Your Senior Sister, Second Sister, and several Junior Sisters are all waiting for you. Don't run off, I'll take you home!"

As he spoke, he reached out a hand.

Third Disciple's expression grew more conflicted, her bright eyes trembling violently, tears streaming down her cheeks as she murmured, "Master, Master..."

Yang Kai was overjoyed. Third Disciple had clearly remembered something.
