## Chapter 1430 — Mo Yu's Request

After entering the Reception Hall, host and guests took their seats; disciples immediately brought out tea and plates of fruit, attending with the utmost eagerness.

Ye Xijun and Yang Yan had not come along, so Qian Tong and the others relaxed, sipping tea and offering continuous praise, their tones full of admiration for the Lingxiao Sect and its future.

After a long moment, Yang Kai broke into a bright smile and steered the conversation to the main point: "Although this may be abrupt, I still want to ask—when the Imperial Jade first appeared, how many did each of your sects obtain?"

A sharp light flashed in Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu's eyes; after a short pause Fei Zhi Tu said, "You're not an outsider. Brother Mo and I have known each other for hundreds of years; we know each other's roots. If someone else asked, I certainly wouldn't answer, but since you brought it up… hm, Yingyue Hall strained for it and in the end only managed to snatch two pieces."

Turning then to Mo Yu, he grinned as the other replied, "Although our Qiantian Sect is far from where the Imperial Garden originally stood, luck favored us—an Imperial Jade drifted near our sect and was intercepted by other elders; and by coincidence I obtained one!"

It was likewise two pieces, the same number as Yingyue Hall.

Over on the other side, Daiyuan parted her vermilion lips and said softly, "I don't know exactly how many the Liuli Sect has; I only heard from Master that it wasn't many, maybe just one or two."

Yang Kai nodded lightly; the news matched his estimates. When the Imperial Jade first emerged, the first piece fell in Dragon Lair Mountain, shattering its protective mountain array—he arrived first and took it. Later, when he, Yang Yan and Ye Xijun rushed to Flowing Flame Sandland, the three of them joined forces to block another Imperial Jade.

They chased after more afterward but gained nothing, only wasting a good deal of time.

In other words, he himself had only two Imperial Jades!

The Imperial Jade is the pass to enter the Imperial Garden; it is used to counter Imperial Might. A single Imperial Jade can only guarantee one person's safe entry. With so few pieces scattered among the great sects, when the Imperial Garden truly opens there will certainly be disputes and fierce scrambling over who may enter.

Those at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm need no reminder—the Imperial Garden's name is irresistible; they more than anyone hope to enter and seek their chance, to see if they can break through to the Void King Realm.

The younger disciples cannot be left behind either; after all, each sect's youngsters are that sect's future hope. Letting them enter to temper themselves will do wonders for their future growth.

But places are limited; how to choose will be up to each sect. Yang Kai guessed that the old generation of powerful experts would likely lead the young to enter together.

"Ah, the appearance of the Imperial Jade may be fortunate, but it's also stirred a bloody wind across the Dark Star. Recently many small forces and families have been wiped out, all because of the Imperial Jade!" Qian Tong sighed and slowly shook his head.

Innocent men suffer; possessing a treasure invites trouble. Some small sects and families were lucky enough to obtain Imperial Jade, but once news leaked they were targeted by stronger powers and faced annihilation.

Besides that, the Imperial Jade has become the hottest commodity. Some warriors without backing who obtained one, knowing their own weakness or unwilling to risk their lives, have sought to sell it.

Naturally this has drawn a scramble from countless people.

The price of a single Imperial Jade has been hyped to over one hundred million Saint Crystals, and even so demand still outstrips supply.

Which sect wouldn't want an extra slot? This is different from Flowing Flame Sandland—after Flowing Flame Sandland opens only warriors below the Origin Returning Realm can enter, but the Imperial Garden has no such restriction.

One could say the sudden appearance of Imperial Jade has set the entire Dark Star to sharpening weapons—dark currents surge beneath the surface.

Although Yingyue Hall has only two Imperial Jades for now, that doesn't mean only two people will ever enter. If fortune favors them and they acquire more Imperial Jades, their quota could increase.

Thoughts flickered through Yang Kai's mind, and he asked, "May I ask if you know what use the Imperial Jade actually has?"

Qian Tong smiled faintly, swept his hand over his spatial ring and a palm-sized white jade plaque appeared—indeed an Imperial Jade—and calmly said, "Although we've never used it before, Yingyue Hall's elders speculate this Imperial Jade is likely the key to open the Imperial Garden, the pass for entering it."

Saying so, he poured Saint Yuan into it and the Imperial Jade immediately shot out a round white radiance that enveloped Qian Tong's palm.

The white light shield was not large, only about half a chi in area.

"Oh? It has grown a bit larger." Qian Tong's brow lifted and a trace of pleasure showed; explaining to Yang Kai he continued, "When I poured Saint Yuan into it some days ago the shield wasn't this big. It seems the light curtain produced by the Imperial Jade grows gradually over time. When it can fully enclose a person, one should be able to safely enter the Imperial Garden."

"Indeed!" Mo Yu nodded slightly from his side. "Brother Qian's idea aligns with mine."

He then took out his own Imperial Jade and poured Saint Yuan into it; a white shield burst forth and completely wrapped his palm, matching Qian Tong's in size with almost no difference. He added, "The Imperial Might radiating from the Imperial Garden is irresistible; we can only use the Imperial Jade to offset it. Otherwise, no matter how high our cultivation, approaching the Imperial Garden would end one way!"

Death!

When the Imperial Garden first appeared, nearly a hundred experts on the Dark Star joined forces to force their way in, but half fell under that invisible Imperial Might. In recent days the great sects have been monitoring the Imperial Garden's movements and racking their brains to figure out how to neutralize its Imperial Might, but so far no good solution has been found.

The appearance of the Imperial Jade provided a turning point.

Mo Yu and Qian Tong thought Yang Kai might not understand and kindly demonstrated, offering their guess—unaware that Yang Kai actually knew better than anyone present.

Yang Kai had invited them into the Lingxiao Sect partly to tell them about the Imperial Jade's purpose. In hindsight his demonstration had been unnecessary; others were not fools and could deduce some truths from clues.

"Judging by the rate at which the Jade's shield expands, to safely enter the Imperial Garden would likely take at least another half year," Qian Tong said, looking up at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, his expression composed.

Half a year is a long buffer; the great powers can use that time to purchase more Imperial Jades, prepare before entering the Imperial Garden, and raise their cultivations. Though half a year won't change most people's strength much, for Yang Kai that time was invaluable.

He was already at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, only one step from the Origin Returning Realm. With enough luck and opportunity, he could use these six months to break through to the Origin Returning Realm; if he stepped into that domain his strength would rise considerably.

Then entering the Imperial Garden would be much safer.

With his mind made up, Yang Kai grew more certain and asked after a pause, "By the way, when did the Imperial Garden move above our Lingxiao Sect? Have any of you discovered anything earlier?"

Qian Tong and the others exchanged glances and smiled bitterly.

Fei Zhi Tu said, "Heaven only knows how it got here. I even suspect you all did something, or that one of you has some tie to the Imperial Garden—otherwise why would it follow you?"

Though said in jest, Yang Kai's eye twitched. Fei Zhi Tu's words were not without truth: the Imperial Garden's pursuit likely had much to do with Yang Yan, a fact Yang Kai could not disclose.

"As for when it happened, about a month ago. Not long after you left Dragon Lair Mountain. The first day the Imperial Garden was fine; by the next day it had vanished. We were all startled, thinking the Imperial Garden had simply disappeared and we'd missed a great opportunity. Then news came that it had moved above Flowing Flame Sandland, so we came to investigate and found it to be true," Fei Zhi Tu said helplessly, shaking his head—clearly the Imperial Garden had given them no small trouble.

After all, this is the Starry Sky Emperor's private villa; no one wants it to simply disappear from view.

"I see." Yang Kai nodded and gave a surprised smile. "It seems our Lingxiao Sect is quite fated with the Imperial Garden—wherever it goes it gets tied to us."

The remark drew only smiles from those present; none took it seriously.

After a moment of idle talk, Mo Yu's expression flickered and he said, "Sect Master Yang, I have a favor to ask—may I trouble you to grant it?"

Yang Kai grinned broadly and said cheerfully, "Senior Mo is too polite. Though I am Sect Master, I am still young. If Senior Mo holds me in regard, just call me Yang Kai—'Sect Master' is too formal."

A trace of surprise flashed through Mo Yu’s eyes before he burst into hearty laughter, clearly delighted. “Good! Sect Master Yang is truly a man of character, unbound by trifles. This old man has decided—we’re friends from now on!”

"You flatter me, Senior," Yang Kai answered humbly. "But what is the matter you wish me to agree to?"

Though he asked the question, Yang Kai already had a vague idea of what Mo Yu intended to say.

Mo Yu cleared his throat and his face grew solemn: "Since the Imperial Garden is now above your sect, your sect is in the privileged position. When the Imperial Garden opens, would you allow people from my Qiantian Sect to set out from here and enter the Imperial Garden?"

Of course—that matched Yang Kai's guess. With the Imperial Garden above the Lingxiao Sect, departing from here to enter it would save at least half a day to a full day compared with setting out from outside. Such an early lead might allow one to discover many better things.

For that reason Mo Yu found it hard to broach; his relationship with Yang Kai was not particularly close, so Yang Kai's refusal would be understandable.
