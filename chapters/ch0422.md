## Chapter 422 — Those Two Old Guys

Back then, Yang Kai told the Xiang Family and the Nan Family that within three months, they had to show their sincerity in Zhongdu.

The Nan Family had sent four boxes of supplies, which was quite a costly offering. However, the Xiang Family sent a group of people, led personally by the Second Young Master of the Xiang Family, which left Yang Kai somewhat puzzled.

After a brief exchange, he formed some suspicions and proceeded to ask Qiu Yimeng about the situation.

This young lady, unlike himself, had lived long-term in Zhongdu and was well-informed about the great forces of the world. Given the depth and means of the Qiu Family, she must have heard some insider information regarding the Xiang Family.

Upon hearing Yang Kai's words, Qiu Yimeng smiled wryly. This man's shrewdness was truly overwhelming.

"You have met Xiang Chu, the Eldest Young Master of the Xiang Family and their future successor. The Xiang Second Young Master is said to have been born from a concubine. Naturally, his status in the clan is lower than his elder brother’s, but he possesses exceptional talent and a remarkable aptitude for cultivation. He is the most outstanding genius the Xiang Family has seen in decades. You should have seen his level when you fought him — Young yet already at the Ninth Stage of True Essence Realm. Such a level is rare."

"Hmm." Yang Kai nodded. Among the younger generation of the Yang Family, there were also few who had reached the Ninth Stage of True Essence Realm, but that was due to their lack of resources as many had been training elsewhere.

Still, Xiang Tianxiao's talent was undeniable.

Within first-rate forces, geniuses did exist. For instance, the elite disciple Wu Chengyi from the Jiu Xing Sword Sect whom they encountered during a past expedition had already reached the Seventh or Eighth Stage of True Essence Realm. If he were still alive today, he might have advanced to Divine Roaming. Yet, when compared by age, Wu Chengyi was older than Xiang Tianxiao.

"Xiang Chu is sharp and scheming, deeply calculating. But his younger brother, Xiang Tianxiao, is quite the opposite. He is straightforward and genuine, and with his outstanding talent, he has earned the favor of many elders within the Xiang Family," Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly. "This brings us to the main issue."

"The succession problem?" Yang Kai furrowed his brows.

"Exactly. Among all the major forces, only your Yang Family decides its successor through a succession war. The Seven Great Families of Zhongdu, and even the top first-rate forces in the world, typically have the eldest legitimate son inherit the position of clan head," Qiu Yimeng explained, her expression briefly clouding but then recovering. "As long as the eldest son is not too incompetent, his position is generally stable. The successor does not necessarily need to be the strongest cultivator; he merely needs to properly manage the Clan. For example, Lü Liang of the Lü Family is only at the Seventh Stage of Divine Roaming Realm, and although there are stronger figures in the Lü Family, he remains its head. First, because of his capability, and second, because he is the eldest legitimate son. Our Qiu Family operates similarly..."

"The Xiangs are no exception. Xiang Chu is the rightful heir, but Xiang Tianxiao's exceptional performance has made Xiang Chu aware of a threat. I've heard — only hearsay — that Xiang Chu often schemes against his younger brother, while Xiang Tianxiao hasn’t resisted, seemingly uninterested in vying for power," she added.

Yang Kai listened closely, confirming his own suspicions, nodding slightly: "Given Xiang Chu's personality, it's quite plausible."

"In that case, you can understand why Xiang Tianxiao appeared at your residence," Qiu Yimeng asked with a smile.

"I understand now," Yang Kai said clearly.

Fearing his brother’s ability and with Yang Kai leveraging him, Xiang Chu sent his younger brother to assist Yang Kai in the succession war.

Firstly, Yang Kai did need allies in the succession war, so this was a practical gesture, likely more valuable than the Nan Family’s four boxes of goods.

Secondly, with Xiang Tianxiao by Yang Kai’s side, if Yang Kai were defeated by other Yang Family sons during the war, it would prove that Xiang Chu was superior to his brother and secure his right to succeed.

Xiang Chu’s two birds with one stone plan was quite clever.

He might also intend to eliminate those around Xiang Tianxiao during the war since those individuals formed the supporting faction backing him.

"Do you think this person is reliable?" Yang Kai looked toward Qiu Yimeng.

Her cheerful smile blossomed at his gentle inquiry. "I think he’s useful! But whether you use him or not is your decision."

"Let’s hold off for now." Yang Kai was cautious. Whether Xiang Tianxiao sincerely intended to assist him was yet uncertain. He was always prudent and wouldn’t blindly trust a stranger based on this information alone.

Time would reveal their true intentions.

"Hmm," Qiu Yimeng nodded her head lightly, seemingly expecting his reaction. "But I have some not-so-good news about Xiang Tianxiao. Do you want to hear it?"

"What news?"

"His elder brother and Nan Sheng of the Nan Family are also in War City!" Qiu Yimeng giggled.

Yang Kai was not surprised, his expression calm: "Which side did they choose?"

"Your Second Brother, Yang Zhao!"

"Good choice!" Yang Kai snorted lightly, "Looks like tonight is going to be lively."

Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly but no longer appeared as anxious or confused as before. Since Yang Kai wanted her to watch the show, she had no reason to worry further.

"Young Master Kai, do you have any other matters? If not, I will take my leave," Qiu Yimeng asked with a gentle smile.

Yang Kai glanced at her oddly, then smirked: "Don’t tease me like that; I can’t handle it."

Seeing his awkward expression, Qiu Yimeng laughed heartily, feeling unusually carefree.

"But there really is something I want you to do," Yang Kai’s expression turned serious again as he said.

"What is it?"

"A hundred zhang from the mansion outside, on that elm tree, there are two old guys. Have someone bring them two pots of wine."

Qiu Yimeng looked stunned: "Two old guys? What kind of people?"

"I guess they’re from the Huo Family. Probably here to protect Huo Xingchen," Yang Kai replied.

The young lady blinked a few times, puzzled. She couldn’t understand why Yang Kai was so sure there were two people there.

Moreover, if they were protecting Huo Xingchen, they must be experts who had long accompanied that wolf-like young master of Zhongdu. These were formidable cultivators at the Eighth Stage of Divine Roaming Realm!

With their cultivation, how did Yang Kai discover their whereabouts?

Though confused, Qiu Yimeng did not find Yang Kai’s guess strange.

Although Huo Zheng was furious with his son’s Primordial Qi, Huo Xingchen was the sole heir of the Huo Family. Being alone in Yang Kai’s mansion, heightened protection was reasonable. If two people were really there, they were likely secretly sent by Huo Zheng himself.

Full of suspicion, Qiu Yimeng stepped out and frowned for a moment, then surprisingly fetched two pots of wine herself and, with great diligence, headed outside.

One hundred zhang from Yang Kai’s mansion, at the top of the elm tree.

Thick leaves concealed the figures of two Huo Family experts. Their breathing was even and calm, with their aura retracted to the utmost. Misty halos floated around them, flowing along mysterious and subtle paths, concealing their presence completely in the air.

Even if someone stood beneath and looked up, their traces could not be discovered unless using Divine Sense, which would reveal hints.

At this moment, the two sat on the trunk, meditating and cultivating out of boredom.

Their imperceptible Divine Sense covered the entire Yang Kai estate, detecting any disturbances. Their powerful Divine Sense gathered and dispersed, always ready to strike.

Thus, despite hiding here, they had no fear anyone would harm their young master.

Their Divine Sense coverage naturally exposed them to Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu, but since the latter two were recovering from injuries and bore no ill intent, the experts turned a blind eye to their presence.

The sound of footsteps rustled below. At first, the two ignored it. With tens of thousands living in War City and the mansion’s remote location, passersby were common.

But as the footsteps drew nearer, both opened their eyes and exchanged a glance in puzzlement.

These footsteps… seem to be heading toward us.

Looking down, they were stunned.

Qiu Yimeng, acting like a maid, carried a tray with two pots of aged fine wine, smiling gently as she walked step by step toward them.

Reaching under the tree, she looked up, meeting the gaze of one of the Huo Family experts.

His heart skipped. He subconsciously thought his concealment Martial Skill had failed. But upon investigation, the skill was still effective. Moreover, Qiu Yimeng's gaze was vacant, apparently just coincidentally looking that way, not focused on him.

She did not see him.

"The air is dry, and you two seniors must be thirsty sitting on the tree for so long. These two pots of wine are to moisten your throats. I hope you won’t mind," her voice reached their ears.

The two exchanged glances, then simultaneously flicked a finger.

Ripples spread, and their forms suddenly appeared in Qiu Yimeng’s eyes.

Since they had been revealed, they felt no need to continue hiding, especially considering Qiu Yimeng’s unusual status.

Seeing them appear, Qiu Yimeng remained calm, deeply admiring Yang Kai.

The two lightly descended from the tree and stood before Qiu Yimeng, cupping hands respectfully.

"Greetings, Miss Qiu. Thank you for your trouble."

While speaking, they took the two pots of fine wine.

"Enjoy yourselves," Qiu Yimeng smiled and nodded, about to turn back.

"Miss Qiu, please wait!" one exclaimed anxiously.

"What is it?" Qiu Yimeng looked at him suspiciously.

He frowned and hesitated for a long moment before saying, "May I ask, Miss Qiu, how did you discover our whereabouts? Did those two Blood Servants of the Yang Family inform you?"
