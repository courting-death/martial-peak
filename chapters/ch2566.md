## Chapter 2566 — Yang Youwei

He really had no other choice; he wasn’t sure if saying this would help, but it was a lifeline, so he seized it.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai’s hand actually stopped moving.

The Yao General, having survived the ordeal, immediately realized his gamble was right. He spoke, “Sir, rest assured. As long as you spare my life, I won’t let you down. Besides, I still have some men under me. If you send them out to search, they might be able to help.”

That actually made some sense!

Yang Kai hadn’t expected to run into Ice Heart Valley’s Third Disciple in this desolate Ancient Land. Since he’d already encountered her, he couldn’t just let it go. But the Third Disciple was elusive, her concealment technique was extremely powerful, and if it was just him and Zhang Ruoxi searching, they might truly be powerless.

If he could get the Yao General’s help, it would save some time, since the other side had more people.

To reassure Yang Kai—or rather, to save his own life—the Yao General gritted his teeth and proactively offered, “If you think it’s acceptable, I’m willing to hand over my soul imprint and serve you loyally.”

Handing over the soul imprint meant becoming a soul slave. Life and death would be at Yang Kai’s whim. Previously, to control Hua Qingsi, Yang Kai had done exactly this.

But Hua Qingsi had been forced into it, while this Yao General was offering it of his own accord.

Of course, this Yao General never had much backbone. Now, to save his life, he didn’t care about such things. Who knows if he’d regret it later.

“Give it here!” Yang Kai reached out a hand to him.

“You really want it…” The Yao General’s mouth twitched. Facing Yang Kai’s cold gaze, he didn’t dare resist, obediently closed his eyes, focused, and activated a secret technique. In no time, a strand of golden light floated from his forehead, which Yang Kai grabbed.

The Yao General groaned, his face turning pale.

After Yang Kai sealed the soul imprint in his own Sea of Consciousness, he put away the Myriad Sword and said calmly, “Get up.”

The Yao General felt bitter but knew he’d at least kept his life. He quickly got up, dusted himself off, and glanced at his mount, which lay dead and cut in half not far away, sighing softly.

“Sir, please have that young lady stop. I’m afraid she might get hurt!” The Yao General pointed at Zhang Ruoxi, who was still fighting many yao.

Yang Kai nodded and sent a message to Zhang Ruoxi.

The Yao General also shouted, “Everyone, stop!”

It was clear he had authority among these yao. At his command, the yao all retreated, opening distance from Zhang Ruoxi, leaving two corpses on the ground.

Although their side had been fighting fiercely, not many had died. Zhang Ruoxi, fighting many at once, couldn’t go all out, since she was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Still, in this short time, she’d already killed two yao, while remaining unscathed herself, which terrified the other yao.

Luckily, the Yao General ordered them to stop. Otherwise, if a few more died, they might not have the courage to keep fighting.

Both groups looked toward the Yao General and Yang Kai. Seeing them unharmed, they showed curiosity, not knowing what was happening.

The Yao General coughed lightly and said, “It was a misunderstanding. This gentleman is one of us. No need to fight anymore.”

He didn’t dare tell his men he’d become Yang Kai’s soul slave. He still needed some dignity. As he spoke, he furtively watched Yang Kai’s expression, finding he didn’t mind, and finally relaxed.

The yao all looked at each other, confused. This man and woman looked human—how did they suddenly become allies?

But having witnessed Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi’s strength, they didn’t dare say much, fearing another disaster.

“From now on, seeing this gentleman is like seeing me. Understood?” The Yao General pointed at Yang Kai and shouted again.

The yao, though bewildered, nodded. Mostly out of fear, they didn’t even think about avenging their dead comrades.

The Yao General then turned, smiling obsequiously, “Sir, you must be tired from your journey. Why not come up the mountain and rest?”

“Rest for what!” Yang Kai replied coldly, waving his hand. “Get them searching. If you don’t find her, you’re dead.”

The Yao General’s face turned bitter. “Sir, you don’t understand. That woman won’t show herself for a while. Searching is useless.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “What do you mean?”

The Yao General clasped his hands. “She’s very timid. Whenever she’s frightened, she hides for a month or two. No one can find her during that time. So if you want to find her, you’ll have to wait. When things calm down, she’ll reappear.” Seeing Yang Kai’s suspicious look, the Yao General swore, “Every word is true, sir. You can ask them.”

The Third Disciple was timid—Yang Kai had seen it himself. It was probably related to some mental issue, so he didn’t think the Yao General was lying. Besides, his life was in Yang Kai’s hands; he wouldn’t dare.

“You still have to search. Notify me immediately if there’s news.” Yang Kai snorted.

Though he knew the Yao General wouldn’t lie, Yang Kai still hoped for a miracle.

“Yes, yes!” The Yao General couldn’t refuse Yang Kai and ordered the yao to spread out and search, reporting any news immediately.

Twenty or thirty yao of varying cultivation scattered in all directions, leaving five to stand by.

“Where do we rest?” Yang Kai looked at the Yao General expressionlessly. Now that someone was helping him search for the Third Disciple, he didn’t need to work so hard. And since the Yao General said the Third Disciple wouldn’t appear for a month or two, he had no intention of searching himself, just waiting to see what happened.

The Yao General immediately gestured, nodding and bowing, “This way, not far, just half a day’s journey.”

Yang Kai nodded, leapt upward, and flew in that direction.

Zhang Ruoxi didn’t know what Yang Kai was up to, but didn’t ask. She followed him into the air, and as she passed the Yao General, she looked at him with contempt.

He was at least an Emperor Realm yao, so how could he be so spineless? Even less than a human. Wasn’t it said that the yao in the Ancient Land were fierce and hard to provoke?

The Yao General, glared at by Zhang Ruoxi, had no temper left. He awkwardly rubbed his nose and followed.

Following his lead, the group flew toward the Yao General’s resting place.

“What’s your name?” Yang Kai suddenly asked midway.

The Yao General cupped his hands, “I am Yang Youwei!”

“Earlier you mentioned Yao King Yingfei. What’s his background?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Yang Youwei’s expression turned solemn. “Lord Yingfei is one of the eight Yao Kings under the Saint Venerable. His strength is unfathomable, already at the peak of the Twelfth-Tier, comparable to the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm!”

“Eight Yao Kings!” Yang Kai frowned. “So there are seven more like him?”

Yang Youwei laughed proudly. “More than seven! The entire Ancient Land has thirty-two Yao Kings.”

Yang Kai was shocked. “That many? All at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm?”

Yang Youwei nodded. “Of course. Without that strength, they couldn’t hold the Yao King position. Actually, there are more than thirty-two with such power, but only thirty-two Yao King positions. The strong ones who didn’t get a Yao King seat serve the Saint Venerables. Altogether, there are a dozen or so, each as strong as the top Yao Kings, maybe even stronger.”

Yang Kai drew a sharp breath.

Before coming here, he hadn’t known there were so many powerful yao in the Ancient Land. Hearing Yang Youwei’s explanation, he realized he’d underestimated this place.

In the entire Star Realm, which sect could have so many Third Stage Emperor Realm experts? Even the sects of the Great Emperors probably didn’t. At most, seven or eight.

In other words, the Ancient Land’s power was equal to four or five overlord sects like Star God Palace combined.

No wonder people said the Ancient Land was dangerous. It was more than dangerous—it was like the gates of hell. One careless step and you wouldn’t even know how you died.

He was slightly glad he hadn’t killed Yang Youwei on the spot. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have learned all this, making him worry about the journey ahead.

“What about the Saint Venerable?” Yang Kai suddenly asked, a chilling thought crossing his mind.

“The Saint Venerables are the Saint Venerables!” Yang Youwei chuckled. “They rule the entire Ancient Land. Oh, right, in human terms, the Saint Venerables are Divine Spirits!”

As expected…

Yang Kai was shocked. Though rumors said Divine Spirits lived in the Ancient Land, no one had confirmed it. But from Yang Youwei’s words, it seemed all the yao here knew.

There really were Divine Spirits in the Ancient Land!

Zhang Ruoxi was also stunned, looking at Yang Youwei, unable to digest the news, her lips parted, breathing softly.

And that wasn’t all—Yang Youwei dropped another bombshell: “There are four Saint Venerables in the Ancient Land. Each has eight Yao Kings and left and right Saint Envoys. Our Ancient Land’s strength is extraordinary.”

Four Saint Venerables… That meant four Divine Spirits? Yang Kai’s face turned pale.

Though his strength was impressive, he had no way to fight a Divine Spirit.

Yang Youwei watched Yang Kai’s expression and secretly laughed. Serves you right for not giving me face—now you’re scared!

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai turned and glared at him. “No matter how strong the Saint Venerables and Yao Kings are, I can still take your life in an instant.”

Now it was Yang Youwei’s turn to pale, crying, “Sir, I am utterly loyal to you! My heart is as clear as the sun and moon, heaven and earth can attest. Please see my sincerity!”

What nonsense loyalty—how long had they even known each other? And now he’s talking about loyalty—what a load of nonsense, lying through his teeth without even blinking.

“Don’t worry. Once we find that woman, I’ll return your freedom!” Yang Kai snorted. After a stick, he had to offer a carrot.

Yang Youwei was overjoyed, but said, “I am willing to serve you loyally, without a second thought.”

Who knows where he learned such phrases—his flattery was endless, always trying to please, and he spoke so seriously that Zhang Ruoxi’s contempt grew even deeper.
