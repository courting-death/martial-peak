## Chapter 1441 — He Is Here

The power of space was a divine ability few could ever cultivate, and an arcane art that virtually no one could truly master.

It was by relying on the Spatial Force that Yang Kai was able to take a step forward at the limit, and that was far from the end; the Spatial Force wrapped around him and fused with his own Shi, together resisting the Imperial Might, and Yang Kai felt he could continue to climb!

From this one successful attempt, Yang Kai vaguely formed an idea that excited him.

Whether that idea would succeed remained to be tested in the trials to come!

Thinking this, the gloom that had clung to Yang Kai vanished, replaced by unmatched exhilaration; he continuously drove the Spatial Force, letting it blend with his Shi, repeating what he had been doing for the past three days!

...

Seven days later, a pristine white veil of light wrapped Yang Kai and swiftly flew upward; that white veil was, of course, the protective dome of the Imperial Jade. With that protection Yang Kai felt no suppression from the Imperial Might and could quickly draw near the Imperial Garden.

It had already been ten full days since the Imperial Garden actually opened, and during these ten days Yang Kai had been cultivating his Shi and reaped great gains!

Although he had entered ten days later than others and many good things had surely been taken by those who arrived earlier, Yang Kai did not regret it; compared with those treasures, what he had gained on this trip already left him satisfied.

His Shi had now reached a limit and could no longer be further strengthened by Imperial Might, so Yang Kai acted decisively and raced toward the Imperial Garden!

Soon he arrived at the nearest Space Array, a disc-like device; when viewed from below Yang Kai had thought it solid, but on approaching he discovered the disc was not a physical object at all but formed from refined energy.

On the disc's surface complex, esoteric patterns shimmered — it was the array diagram of the Space Array.

Raising his head to look at the Imperial Garden, Yang Kai couldn't help frowning; observed so closely, the Imperial Garden actually felt somewhat illusory and ethereal, as if caught between the real and the unreal — extremely uncanny.

It seemed to hang there, and yet not to be there, merely a projection!

After staring for a moment, Yang Kai slowly shook his head, withdrew his gaze, and returned his attention to the Space Array; after a short inspection an expression of understanding appeared on his face.

Not intending to linger, Yang Kai reached out and brushed; several Upper-Level Saint Crystals flew from his hand and fit precisely into the array's recessed slots. Light flared and Yang Kai shot upward. A moment later, when the light dissipated, Yang Kai had already vanished. The sky fell silent and still, as if no one had ever been there.

At the same time, on an unnamed stretch of green grassland, Yang Kai's figure manifested.

The instant he appeared, Yang Kai immediately summoned his Purple Shield, which formed into a purple light guarding before him, while his Divine Sense reached outward in a defensive posture.

He dared not be careless. After all, others had entered ten days earlier; if he suddenly fell into someone's encirclement, a battle would certainly break out.

Fortunately his worry was unnecessary; his Divine Sense searched and found no life traces within a radius of ten li, let alone any ambush.

But the next moment Yang Kai's expression turned astonished. He stared, turning his head to look around, brow furrowing deeply.

Is this the Imperial Garden?

The place where he now stood was above a grassland that stretched beyond sight; the sky was a clear, washed blue, without a cloud for ten thousand li — clearly a day of brilliant sunshine!

But how could this be the Imperial Garden?

Others might not know what the interior of the Imperial Garden looked like, but Yang Kai was all too familiar — the last time he had gone in with Fei Zhi Tu and the others to rescue Qian Tong, he had once penetrated the Imperial Garden; there the buildings were ornamented with carved beams and painted halls, palaces standing in profusion — where would a grassland be?

If this was not the Imperial Garden, Yang Kai found it hard to believe; after all, he had been transmitted through that Space Array, and such transmission should not be in error.

What was happening? Yang Kai felt bewildered.

At the same time, at another point within this space, a beautiful woman in a fiery red palace dress appeared; her dark brows slightly knit and a look of doubt and suspicion crossed her face. She was shapely and strikingly beautiful — a first-rate peerless beauty.

More than that, the woman exuded an intoxicating allure that was not the result of any cultivated bewitching art but innate.

Every frown and smile, every movement bore countless charms.

She stood there like a flame, able to attract countless moths to their deaths.

The Demon Blood Sect's alluring Sect Master was bewitching too, but compared with this woman she was like a trinket before a masterpiece; there was simply no comparison.

At that moment four Origin Returning Realm experts gathered at the woman's side: one at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, two at the Second Stage, and one at the First Stage!

The four formed a horn-like encirclement, cutting off the woman's retreat; each of them eyed her with greed and covetousness.

To be fair, these four men were not merely lecherous brutes — men of such strength, apart from a rare few with unusual tastes, did not place much importance on beauty; they pursued the extremes of the Martial Dao and the advancement of their realms.

Yet this woman was truly exceptional; her provocative charm was something no man could resist. At the instant they saw her face, whether lecherous or not, all four Origin Returning Realm experts felt a stir of desire, itching to seize her and lavish her with affection.

It seemed that even to die after a single night with her would be acceptable.

The woman stood alone. Although she herself radiated the powerful aura of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the four men were not intimidated — after all, they outnumbered her, and one of them could contend with her.

Her lovely face first showed a trace of confusion—the way she pondered, that faint crease between her brows, all carried a charm capable of stealing souls. The four Origin Returning Realm cultivators gathered around her felt their hearts race and faces flush, their lips dry as heat surged through their blood.

Soon the woman's eyes brightened as if she had remembered something, an inexplicable excitement crossing her features as she murmured, "He is here! He's actually here!"

Her voice was soft, but it radiated an almost irresistible charm.

A smile spread across her delicate face that could outshine heaven and earth; that smile caused the four Origin Returning Realm men to lose all reason and, without a word, they struck at the green-clad beauty.

Their blows were fierce, but without killing intent — they only wanted to capture the beauty alive so they could ravish her; they certainly would not wish her any real harm.

Yet they had gravely underestimated the green-clad woman's strength.

Facing the onslaught from all sides, a flash of displeasure passed through the woman's eyes, as if annoyed that the four had interrupted her thoughts.

A beauty in anger was still exceptionally lovely; at least the four attackers involuntarily felt pity and began to ease the force of their blows.

The green-clad woman showed no courtesy. Her body spun in place and a pink mist suddenly billowed out.

Boom, boom, boom……

All the attacks struck the pink mist, only making it ripple and writhe, and failed to break through.

When the mist dispersed it revealed the woman's annoyed face. She beckoned and a delicate little fan appeared in her hand; the fan brimmed with Spiritual Qi and was clearly a Secret Treasure, and to everyone's surprise the fan's surface was embroidered with many exquisite human figures.

Men and women, all stark naked, assumed all manner of postures, expressions rapturous, as if indulging in human pleasures.

The fan’s surface unmistakably depicted an erotic scene!

Ordinary women would never dare use such a shameful Secret Treasure, but the woman didn't care; she tightened her jade fingers on the fan, bit her lip, and cried, "You're courting death!"

With that she lightly waved the fan.

The embroidered figures on the fan seemed to come alive; countless naked men and women burst from the fan and flew at the four attackers, instantly pouring into their bodies.

The four men's faces changed drastically. They intended to mobilize their power to resist, but it was already too late.

One mistake and everything was lost. They had underestimated the terrifying might of the green-dressed beauty and had not struck viciously; now struck by her method, how could they defend?

The scene instantly transformed; the four felt as if plunged into a revel of wine and feasting, seductive music ringing in their ears. Countless young women in gauzy veils appeared beside them, singing and dancing, occasionally displaying their charms; those glances instinctively provoked the lowest desires.

The four were immediately undone, standing foolishly in place with delighted smiles, lost and unable to escape.

The woman looked at the four with contempt, no longer striking, but produced a veil and covered her face, fixed a direction, and swiftly departed.

Though only a vague sense, she knew that person had arrived!

But too much time had passed — twenty or thirty years — she could not rely on her old secret arts to find him; she could only depend on her feeling and pray she would locate him before the Imperial Garden closed.

Otherwise, if she missed this chance, she might never realize her wish.

The woman's figure receded. After the time it took a stick of incense to burn, the four who had stood foolishly collapsed to the ground, blood gushing from their orifices, convulsing as life drained; they died a miserable death.

With a single move she had killed four Origin Returning Realm experts — the terrifying strength of this woman was clear.

"Is this still the Imperial Garden?" Yang Kai murmured on the grassy plain, a look of bewilderment on his face.

He had been here the better part of a cup of tea, but Yang Kai still could not make heads or tails of it.

However, the Spiritual Qi here was indeed extraordinarily dense, much denser than on the Dark Star, and not at all inferior to Yang Kai's own Lingxiao Sect; it had clearly surpassed the Floating Continent.

From that point alone, it could well be the Imperial Garden.

Yet Yang Kai remembered that within the Imperial Garden Divine Sense could not stray far from the body, much less probe the situation within a radius of ten li; judged from this, this place seemed not to be the Imperial Garden.
