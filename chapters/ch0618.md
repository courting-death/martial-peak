## Chapter 618 — Ice-Flame Star Sand

Beneath the swamp it was pitch dark, not a hint of daylight, without the slightest gleam.

Yang Kai followed Shui Ling downward, enclosed within a bubble she had formed. He did not feel bored, and his breathing remained smooth.

His Divine Sense spread outward, and everything around him lay as clear as the palm of his hand.

They kept falling. It appeared the earlier claim was not false — the bottom of this swamp truly plunged down several thousand zhang.

Only someone like Shui Ling, who possessed a Water Spirit Constitution, could move freely here. Were it anyone else, even masters of water arts would be constrained and unable to act normally.

As they descended, Yang Kai gradually felt a chill, which grew ever stronger and more biting.

After a long while, Shui Ling could hardly bear it; her jaw trembled. Yang Kai hurriedly released True Yuan, and the bubble instantly took on a comfortable warmth, driving away all the cold.

"Bringing you down really was the right decision," Shui Ling tittered. Yang Kai's command over his power had reached a consummate level; had he taken that volunteer from Duao Meng earlier, Shui Ling even suspected the man's fire-based power might have clashed with her water bubble.

Yang Kai was different — he could dispel the chill without harming the bubble he had formed.

A faint light began to appear below. Looking out, there seemed to be clusters of pearly white flames, leaping and burning.

They were some distance away, and a thick layer of ice lay between them and the light, obscuring Yang Kai's view.

"Those leaping, flame-like things are the Ice-Flame Star Sand, and the Scarlet Blood True Orchid lies among them," Shui Ling explained. "The ice below is about several dozen zhang thick. Can you break through it without making a sound?"

Yang Kai nodded lightly. "I'll try."

As he spoke, he leapt out of the bubble.

Suddenly a crushing weight like a mountain pressed down on him; Yang Kai's whole body stiffened and his bones creaked.

Without the protection of Shui Ling's bubble, the water pressure from all directions slammed onto Yang Kai.

"If you really can't manage it, don't force it," Shui Ling warned.

Yang Kai acknowledged her and waited a while. After he had grown accustomed to the immense pressure, he began to act.

A blazing stream of True Yang Yuan Qi burst from his palm, like an invincible blade, melting a hole in the ice large enough for a person to pass through.

True Yuan spewed forth fiercely; Yang Kai's movements were devastating, and the ordinary ice could not withstand the searing of the True Yang Yuan Qi.

Shui Ling, wrapped in her bubble, followed closely behind Yang Kai and dove down swiftly.

The several dozen zhang of ice were pierced by Yang Kai in the space of a single cup of tea.

The two quickly arrived before those clusters of leaping, burning Ice-Flame Star Sand.

"You collect the star sand, I'll deal with the Scarlet Blood True Orchid!" Shui Ling cried excitedly and lunged at the Scarlet Blood True Orchid.

The surrounding currents promptly produced strange forces that bound the nearby space, imprisoning the Scarlet Blood True Orchid within a small area.

Yang Kai glanced over but paid it little heed, instead collecting those flame-like clusters into the Black Book Space.

Those leaping, burning things were actually grains of star sand, yet unlike ordinary sand: they were exquisitely beautiful, bone-piercingly cold to the touch, and brimming with Spiritual Qi.

Yang Kai realized he had truly stumbled upon a treasure.

To encounter such a chance upon first arriving on Tongxuan Continent was, in itself, a good omen.

The star sand was not numerous, only about a hundred grains. When Yang Kai finished gathering them, Shui Ling bounded over happily from a short distance away, holding a seven-leaved Spiritual Object between her fingers, and waved to Yang Kai.

She could wield control over the flow of water; underwater, the Scarlet Blood True Orchid could not escape from her palm.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and slipped back into her water bubble.

"Let's go up; those people must be frantic," Shui Ling said with a tight smile, having some inkling of Duao Meng's intentions.

Above the swamp, the members of Duao Meng wore sullen faces and waited in silence.

The bearded great man suddenly cursed, "It's been almost an hour, and those two still haven't come up — they've definitely run off."

"If I see them again, I'll tear them to pieces!"

Yun Xuan snapped sharply, "Don't speak recklessly. That young woman should indeed be a disciple of the Water Divine Hall, and her status is not low."

"Miss, how do you know?"

"She possesses cultivation at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm; to have such cultivation at her age implies standing within the Water Divine Hall, does it not? Someone of that status would not deceive us..." As she spoke, Yun Xuan's voice grew low, as if comforting and convincing herself to trust Shui Ling.

"Even if she has status, so what? The Scarlet Blood True Orchid and the Ice-Flame Star Sand are both extraordinary treasures; who can be certain they wouldn't be moved by profit?"

"If that is the case, then we can only accept defeat!" Yun Xuan sighed softly. "We can only blame ourselves for lacking the ability to claim those two things for our own."

"Ah!" A chorus of sighs rose.

In this world, those with ability obtain good things; those without can only look on with envy. Such occurrences are common: treasures are discovered and seized by the strong, and the weak can do nothing but covet and grow resentful.

"Hey, there’s movement!" the bearded great man exclaimed, his gaze blazing as he peered down at the swamp.

From beneath came the scent of energy, rapidly rising.

The members of Duao Meng were instantly roused, and Yun Xuan could not help but let a great weight fall from her heart.

After a moment, a bubble surfaced, enclosing Yang Kai and Shui Ling.

They flashed to the ground. Shui Ling asked Yun Xuan, "You brought a specialized vessel for holding Spiritual Objects, right?"

"We did, we did!" Yun Xuan hastily nodded, opened a small pouch at her waist, and withdrew a jade basin carved from white jade, its surface inscribed with many array patterns.

Yang Kai observed quietly and discovered that Yun Xuan was using a Spatial Pouch.

Shui Ling nodded slightly. "You are well prepared."

As she spoke, she handed over the Scarlet Blood True Orchid.

Yun Xuan's expression turned strange; she hesitated for a moment, but then cheerfully reached out and took it. "Thank you!"

Her manner was sincere, without the slightest hint of falseness.

Placing the Scarlet Blood True Orchid into the jade basin, Yun Xuan formed several hand-seals; the array on the basin activated immediately, sealing the Spiritual Object within.

"And the Ice-Flame Star Sand?" the bearded great man asked, looking around.

"Ji Hong!" Yun Xuan's face chilled as she barked his name.

"Heh heh, I'm just asking!" Ji Hong scratched his head awkwardly, then smiled at Yang Kai. "Brother, don't mind me. I'm a curious sort. You don't have to say, I know you must have gotten them."

Yang Kai smiled faintly; he found the great man amusing — though he claimed to be merely asking, he was constantly testing ways to learn the whereabouts of the Ice-Flame Star Sand.

"Indeed, we've obtained them," Yang Kai nodded.

"Lucky you, brother. I'm so envious," Ji Hong said, unabashed in his feelings.

Yun Xuan shook her head helplessly and said to Shui Ling, "Miss, you helped us so much this time; the whole of Duao Meng is grateful. According to our rules, each person may receive twenty crystal stones; as team leader I receive fifty. How about I give you eighty percent of all the reward as thanks?"

There were eight people in all: seven would receive twenty crystal stones each, and Yun Xuan would get fifty. That totaled one hundred ninety crystal stones; eighty percent amounts to about one hundred fifty-two crystal stones.

Yun Xuan's generosity immediately left her team members looking troubled.

But thinking it over, without Shui Ling and Yang Kai they might not have gotten even a fraction of the spoils and might have been punished; their moods thus settled considerably.

Shui Ling smiled and pointed at Yang Kai. "Give them to him; I don't need these crystal stones."

Yang Kai's expression stirred slightly; he asked no more. Though he did not know precisely what crystal stones were or their worth, from everyone's mien he understood they must be valuable.

"Very well," Yun Xuan smiled. "Also, if the two of you are willing to sell the Ice-Flame Star Sand, we can discuss it in detail — we guarantee a price that will satisfy you."

Shui Ling chuckled. "Spirit-Grade Upper-Level forging materials — we don't intend to sell them; we'll keep them for our own use."

"I see..." Yun Xuan sounded somewhat disappointed but did not press the matter. "Let's not talk about this now. Consider it and tell me when you've decided. Our Duao Meng headquarters, Duao City, is only three days' journey from here. Could the two of you come back with us so we might properly entertain you?"

After this affair, Yun Xuan no longer bore hostility; instead she made a deliberate show of goodwill.

Shui Ling glanced at Yang Kai, and Yang Kai nodded slightly to indicate agreement.

Shui Ling then said, "Very well; it just so happens I wanted to find a place to rest."

"Please!" Yun Xuan said, and casually appraised Yang Kai, as if re-evaluating him.

The earlier exchange of glances between Shui Ling and Yang Kai had not escaped Yun Xuan's notice.

She was puzzled: Shui Ling seemed to hold a high position in the Water Divine Hall, so why did she act deferentially toward this youth, always consulting him?

What background did this young man have to make such a senior disciple of the Water Divine Hall pay him such heed?

Yun Xuan grew curious and could not help taking an interest in Yang Kai.

They journeyed on, the atmosphere amiable.

Yun Xuan deliberately tried to probe Yang Kai's identity and naturally spoke with him, but Yang Kai's answers were watertight, leaving her powerless to learn more.

Through brief conversation, Yang Kai and Shui Ling learned that Yun Xuan was her name, and that she served as the captain of a subordinate squad of Duao Meng.

Those six or seven people were the members of that squad.

Duao Meng differs somewhat from other powers; it is consolidated into squads that mainly deal in materials and finished goods used for cultivation. These squads spend their years traveling to find various business opportunities and materials for Duao Meng, bringing in profit, while Duao Meng provides those warriors with a comfortable and secure environment for cultivation.
