## Chapter 989 — I am called Shen Tu

The middle-aged man who had brought Yang Kai here exchanged a few curt words with the warrior called Ke Meng and then left without further ado.

While they talked, Yang Kai said nothing, silently taking in his surroundings; his quiet composure pleased Ke Meng greatly.

“Kid, come with me!” Ke Meng waved at Yang Kai and led him as they moved through the vast chamber.

Before long they arrived at an isolated cell.

There had originally been a warrior in the place, bound by shackles at hands and feet, forced to sit cross-legged on the floor, but now he was already dead—his life extinguished.

In his final moments he had apparently suffered extreme agony: his eyes were bulging, his mouth gaped open, and the veins in his neck stood out in a terrifying display.

He must have endured unimaginable torment while alive; there was almost no flesh left on his body, his bones wrapped in skin, his face pale without a trace of blood.

“Bring it over—throw the corpse out,” Ke Meng shouted to the side.

Immediately a warrior hurried up, unfastened the dead man from his shackles, hoisted the body and quickly vanished.

Ke Meng sneered and said to Yang Kai, “Kid, you behave and you won’t suffer. After all, you belong to Lady Bi Ya; I don’t want to make her unhappy, so cooperate—it's better for both of us.”

Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

Ke Meng laughed heartily. “Good, that’s best. Hmm, you can sit right here.”

He pointed to the spot where the dead man had been sitting.

Yang Kai obediently seated himself and allowed the shackles to be fastened to his hands and feet.

This place, called the warship’s power chamber, concealed many experts who had entered the Saint Realm; Yang Kai could even sense a trace of aura from the Saint King Realm hidden in the darkness.

So he dared not act rashly.

Once the shackles were secured, Yang Kai’s expression changed abruptly.

He had felt a terrifying pull from the shackles, which began ravenously drawing out his Saint Yuan; his inner strength streamed through the restraints into the warship, joining with the energy formed by those massive Saint Crystals to power the vessel.

Only then did Yang Kai understand why so many warriors had been bound here.

He also understood why those imprisoned here were all listless and weak.

Continuous siphoning of their strength would wear anyone down; the more powerful could hold out longer, but those whose power was insufficient would soon be drained to death by unchecked extraction.

The warrior who had been sitting here before had likely died in exactly that way.

“Don’t be afraid!” Ke Meng crouched before Yang Kai and, surprisingly, tried to comfort him. “The warship’s main power still comes from the Saint Crystals here.”

As he spoke he pointed to the rows of huge Saint Crystals. “You people are only auxiliary, nothing to worry about. Here—take these, don’t overthink it, just absorb them.”

A ring on his hand flashed, and a dozen or so fist-sized Saint Crystals appeared before Yang Kai.

These Saint Crystals contained extremely dense energy; though inferior to the larger ones arranged nearby, they were still very good.

“What if they run out?” Yang Kai asked, holding a Saint Crystal in his palm.

“Call for me when they’re used up and I’ll give you more. You belong to Lady Bi Ya, so I won’t be stingy with you!” Ke Meng smiled with meaning.

If that bitch Bi Ya returned and found this kid weak and unable to satisfy her, he might be punished.

“Fine.” Yang Kai said nothing further, closed his eyes, began circulating his art, and absorbed the Saint Crystal’s power to replenish his losses.

Ke Meng straightened, nodded in satisfaction, and slipped back into the shadows to attend to his own business.

After he left, Yang Kai opened his eyes and covertly scanned the surroundings.

The power chamber held at least fifty or sixty bound warriors, most of them feeble—some barely drawing breath and at any moment likely to die. As Yang Kai watched, he suddenly noticed pairs of eyes in the darkness turning toward him from all directions like famished wolves in snow, each filled with avarice.

Those gazes belonged to the imprisoned fighters; they weren’t interested in Yang Kai himself but in the dozen Saint Crystals Ke Meng had left behind.

The shackles that bound them were constantly drawing their strength; the only way to replenish it was to consume Saint Crystals, and they would not receive a generous share from Ke Meng.

In this situation, Saint Crystals equaled life.

A thought crossed Yang Kai’s mind and he immediately understood their reaction.

Without attracting notice, Yang Kai gathered the Saint Crystals between his thighs to shield them from covetous eyes.

He closed his eyes and measured the rate at which the shackles were draining him, and his heart slowly settled.

He found the siphoning was not too rapid; with the Saint Crystals’ power he could fully replenish himself and then some. Sitting here would not put his life in danger—in fact, he could even use the crystals to improve his cultivation.

Still, he sensed something amiss. With so many people in such dire straits, he thought it wise to remain cautious.

“Friend, friend…” a soft call suddenly sounded by his ear.

At first Yang Kai paid no mind, but the voice persisted as if calling specifically to him; he frowned and turned his head toward its source.

Though the light was dim, he could make out a square-faced youth to his right wearing a friendly smile.

The smile had a sycophantic edge to it.

Yang Kai’s lips twitched; he had already guessed the youth’s intent and asked coldly, “Calling me?”

“Yeah.” The youth nodded eagerly, revealing a flash of white teeth in the dark. “My name’s Shen Tu. What should I call you, friend?”

“None of your business.”

The youth kept up his playful grin, unconcerned by Yang Kai’s coldness, and said with forced familiarity, “We’re both castaways of the same world—let’s be friends. No need to be so guarded, right?”

“I don’t make friends with strangers.” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Don’t say that.” Shen Tu’s brow twitched, his face full of lewdness. “As the saying goes, once is unfamiliar, twice makes it easier, and by the third time it’s smooth sailing. Chat long enough and we won’t be strangers anymore.”

Yang Kai decisively shut his eyes and ignored him.

Shen Tu’s face fell and he protested, “Hey, hey—don’t ignore me. Sitting here is boring anyway; chatting would pass the time.”

“Relax. I’m not after your Saint Crystals. These stupid shackles can’t touch me. Even if it drains me for a hundred years, it won’t kill me.”

“I really don’t want your Saint Crystals—look at my complexion. Feel my life fluctuations; I’m nothing like those near-death people.”

Shen Tu jabbered on and on; Yang Kai ignored him, but he babbled relentless as if vowing not to stop until Yang Kai answered.

“By the way, I heard you were brought here by a woman called Bi Ya? Tsk tsk—bro, you’re lucky, but unlucky whom you got caught by. If she ever tries something with you, don’t agree. Her reputation has spread through the starry void; anyone who sleeps with her won’t fare well—she’ll drain you dry. That’s the most brutal way to die; just thinking about it gives me chills.”

He tried to grab Yang Kai’s attention by bringing up a topic he thought would stir him, to awaken his sense of danger.

Yang Kai remained unmoved.

“Haven’t you heard my name? Let’s be friends—when we get out of here I’ll look out for you. I can let you enjoy wealth and honor, no want for food or clothing—Saint Crystals, Secret Treasures, beauties—name it and I’ll get it for you.”

Yang Kai’s previously closed eyes suddenly opened and a faint divine light flashed in the darkness.

Shen Tu froze, then grinned widely—thinking he’d finally hit on something that interested Yang Kai. Just as he was about to continue, something flew toward him from across the way.

Shen Tu’s eyes and hands were quick; he snatched the object and, realizing what it was, his face lit with joy as he gratefully looked at Yang Kai. “Brother, thanks—you're so easy to deal with.”

He hadn’t expected Yang Kai to silently give him a Saint Crystal!

That was precisely his intention in flattering Yang Kai.

Although Ke Meng distributed some Saint Crystals to the bound warriors daily to sustain them, the allotment was far too little.

Shen Tu hadn’t been held here long and his strength wasn’t low, so he was still relatively lively, but he couldn’t promise how long he could hold out.

Today Yang Kai had received a dozen Saint Crystals, and Ke Meng had generously said to ask for more when they were used up. Hearing this, Shen Tu, who sat beside Yang Kai, naturally became eager.

Having once enjoyed wealth and honor, Shen Tu had no care for it before—he never imagined that a mere Lower-Level Saint Crystal could make his heart bloom with joy.

This single Lower-Level Saint Crystal made him more reluctant to part with it than the finest woman.

“Brother, could you spare another? You’ve got so many, you won’t run out for now.” Shen Tu shamelessly pleaded, looking unsatisfied.

Yang Kai smiled oddly at him.

Shen Tu didn’t know what he meant; lost in thought, he suddenly heard Yang Kai shout.

Ke Meng appeared at once and came to Yang Kai’s side in quick steps, displeased. “What are you doing? Kid, did you forget what I told you? I said you’d better behave.”

“He stole a Saint Crystal from me when I wasn’t looking!” Yang Kai pointed at Shen Tu.

Ke Meng followed his finger and saw Shen Tu clutching the Lower-Level Saint Crystal tightly to his chest like a treasure, refusing to let go.

The smile on Shen Tu’s face froze, and he stood there stupefied.
