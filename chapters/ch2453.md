## Chapter 2453 — Killing with a Borrowed Knife

"So it really is you!" Yin Lesheng's expression changed instantly, his eyes blazing with hatred as if meeting a mortal enemy. He gritted his teeth and said, "You really are hard to kill. Not only did you survive that disaster all those years ago, you even made it to the Shattered Star Sea."

Yang Kai stared at him coldly and said in a deep voice, "Yin Lesheng, I have only one question for you. You'd better answer honestly. Where did the puppet that was with me back then go?"

Yin Lesheng smiled faintly at these words and said, "Who knows? Since it was your puppet, why ask me?"

He really did know about Xiaoxiao, Yang Kai thought, his heart stirring. Although Yin Lesheng hadn't answered directly, Yang Kai could tell from his tone and expression that he knew something.

Yang Kai's heart burned with excitement. He stared intently at Yin Lesheng and said, "So you don't plan to tell me, do you?"

Yin Lesheng grinned and said, "Since you already know, why bother embarrassing yourself?"

"Very well!" Yang Kai nodded, his aura suddenly becoming extremely dangerous, like a leopard ready to pounce at any moment. It sent chills down everyone's spine. "Since you won't talk, I'll beat it out of you!"

Yin Lesheng's face darkened. "Do you really think you're invincible?"

"I wouldn't dare claim to be invincible, but crushing you is no problem at all."

Yin Lesheng laughed in anger. "And what makes you think you can? Because you're a Star Lord?"

"What? Brother Yin, what did you just say?"

"This brat is a Star Lord?"

"Isn't the Star Lord body something only those who come from the lower Star Domains possess? Could he be one of them?"

"Tsk, I've heard that those with the Star Lord body possess a complete Stellar Origin, giving them a unique advantage in Martial Dao cultivation. I wonder if that's true."

As soon as they heard Yang Kai was a Star Lord, the surrounding cultivators erupted. Each of them stared at him with burning eyes, as if he were a giant piece of delicious meat.

Everyone had come to the Shattered Star Sea, enduring countless hardships to seek Origin Power, but all they found were fragments. Absorbing and refining them did help with cultivation, but they were still just fragments. How could they compare to a complete Stellar Origin? A complete Stellar Origin allowed for a much deeper understanding of the laws of heaven and earth—something fragments of Origin Power could never match.

It was said that long ago, there were some complete Stellar Origins in the Shattered Star Sea, but as time passed and the place opened year after year, those complete Stellar Origins were long since taken by the ancestors. Only fragments of Origin Power remained.

Perhaps after a few more years, even the fragments of Origin Power in the Shattered Star Sea would disappear, and then the place would lose its current value and appeal to cultivators.

This was why everyone reacted so strongly upon learning Yang Kai was a Star Lord.

Yin Lesheng laughed loudly. "This brat really is a Star Lord. I, Yin, can vouch for that with my own honor."

At these words, everyone looked at him strangely.

Lan He snorted coldly. "How amusing. People from Netherworld Sect actually talk about honor."

Earlier, Yang Kai had saved her life. Now, seeing him being targeted, she naturally spoke up for him, showing she was willing to stand with him.

Yin Lesheng's face darkened as he looked around. "If you don't believe me, you can ask him yourselves. What was his cultivation seven years ago?"

A burly man immediately looked at Yang Kai and rumbled, "Brat. If you heard that, answer quickly!"

Although Yang Kai had killed a cultivator of the same level with a single move earlier, making everyone wary, he was still alone. Now that so many people were staring at him, they believed he couldn't stir up much trouble no matter how strong he was.

Yang Kai glanced sideways at the man and snorted coldly. "None of your damn business."

He acted as if the man wasn't worth his attention, making the man's face turn livid with anger.

Yin Lesheng smiled and said, "Seven years ago, he was only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. Am I right, Yang? I remember it clearly."

"Second Stage of the Void King Realm!"

"How... how is that possible!"

"He went from the Second Stage of the Void King Realm to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm in just seven years? How could that be possible?"

"Brother Yin, are you trying to fool us?"

In seven years, someone had gone from the Second Stage of the Void King Realm to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Such progress was terrifying. Of all the people present, comparing their cultivation from seven years ago to now, most had only advanced a single Stage at best, or not improved at all.

Yin Lesheng said, "What would I gain by lying? Maybe he had some other opportunities, but being a Star Lord is his greatest advantage!"

"I've long heard that those who come from the lower Star Domains are all extraordinary talents, especially the Star Lords. They cultivate at lightning speed. If Brother Yin is telling the truth, then I've really learned something today."

"You actually believe a disciple of Netherworld Sect? It's obvious Yin Lesheng has a grudge with that guy. He's pointing out that he's a Star Lord just to get others to do his dirty work!"

"Even so, I don't care. Who wouldn't want a complete Stellar Origin? If I could get it..."

The whispers around never stopped. Yang Kai sneered, glancing at Yin Lesheng. "Why talk only about me, Brother Yin? Why not tell everyone about yourself? Seven years ago, weren't you just at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm?"

Yin Lesheng smiled faintly. "So what if I was?"

At these words, many people were shocked and looked at Yin Lesheng.

Yang Kai's progress from the Second Stage of the Void King Realm to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm in seven years was already astonishing, but Yin Lesheng's improvement was not much less. Compared to these two, everyone else felt like mediocrities.

Yin Lesheng said openly, "It's no secret. I, too, am a Star Lord. That's why I know just how fast a Star Lord can cultivate."

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone looked at him, their eyes burning with desire.

Yin Lesheng snorted coldly. "But I'm different from that brat. I am the Sect Master's personal disciple. If you want to touch me, you'd better think twice!"

At these words, many people's expressions flickered. After a moment, most slowly shook their heads and looked away from Yin Lesheng.

Yin Lesheng was certainly tempting as a Star Lord, but he was the Sect Master's personal disciple from Netherworld Sect. He must have many life-saving cards up his sleeve. If they really fought him to the death, they might end up losing more than they gained.

On the other hand, Yang Kai looked much easier to deal with.

But precisely because Yin Lesheng admitted he was a Star Lord, his earlier words became more convincing, and those people looked at Yang Kai with even more intense desire.

Yin Lesheng laughed loudly. "Yang Kai, there's a road to heaven you refuse to take, but you insist on barging into hell. With so many heroes here today, let's see where you can run!"

Yang Kai's face darkened as he cursed, "Trying to get others to do your dirty work? Shameless!"

"Who told you to possess a complete Stellar Origin?" Yin Lesheng said indifferently, then shouted, "Everyone, my Netherworld Sect has a secret technique that can completely strip the Stellar Origin from a Star Lord without any loss. If any of you can capture him, you can ask me to help extract the Origin Power. I guarantee to do my utmost, without a trace of selfishness!"

"Haha, with Brother Yin's words, I'm relieved. I was just wondering how we'd seize his Origin even if we killed him. So Netherworld Sect has such an amazing secret technique." The burly man whom Yang Kai had insulted earlier laughed loudly.

Yin Lesheng said, "This man is no pushover. If you want his Stellar Origin, you'd better join forces."

He was now blatantly inciting everyone to gang up on Yang Kai. Although no one liked his approach, the temptation of Origin Power was too great. Besides, Yang Kai's arrogant attitude earlier had really angered them.

In an instant, dozens of auras locked onto Yang Kai, the pressure was almost suffocating. Lan He, standing beside him, turned pale, her brows tightly knit.

Although she was strong, she had never faced so many enemies at once. She couldn't help but feel uneasy about the future and secretly glanced at Yang Kai.

Looking at him, Lan He couldn't help but be amazed.

Because Yang Kai stood there as if nothing was wrong, showing not the slightest fear or timidity. The dozens of auras locked onto him felt like a spring breeze, not affecting him at all.

What incredible mental fortitude! Lan He was secretly shocked.

She hadn't liked Yang Kai much before, always thinking he was strange and not a good person. But after he saved her life, her opinion of him changed somewhat.

After all, everyone else was just watching, but only he had stepped in to help. They were complete strangers, yet he still acted. Clearly, he had a good heart.

Now that the situation had reversed and Yang Kai was being targeted, Lan He naturally couldn't stand by and do nothing.

Just as she made up her mind to help Yang Kai, he suddenly said in a low voice, "Miss Lan, you should leave."

Lan He frowned and said, "What, Yang? Do you look down on me?"

Yang Kai was taken aback and looked at her. "When did I ever mean that?"

Lan He snorted, "Then why are you trying to send me away? Since you helped me before, I can't just sit by now. Don't worry, if they really try to bully you with numbers, I'll help you. I won't drag you down!"

Yang Kai stared at her in a daze. "You'll die."

Lan He's body trembled slightly, but she still said firmly, "Then so be it. I'm not leaving."

A strange look flashed in Yang Kai's eyes as he looked her up and down, as if seeing her anew. Suddenly, he seemed to realize something and asked, "Miss Lan, are you from Heavenly Wolf Valley?"

"That's right." Lan He nodded, not knowing why Yang Kai was asking this at such a critical moment. This guy really was strange.
