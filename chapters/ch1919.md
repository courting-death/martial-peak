## Chapter 1919 — This Is the Betrothal Gift

Ai Ou had originally been very curious about what Yang Kai had taken out; after all, Yang Kai's power was extraordinary and his status was not low, so whatever he produced would surely be no ordinary thing.

When he heard it was a cultivation technique, Ai Ou immediately lost interest and scoffed, "So that's what it is, a cultivation method. Our Hengluo Commerce Guild may be commerce-first, but we place great importance on the Martial Dao. Techniques and the like... you keep it yourself, kid—the Guild doesn't lack for such things."

Yang Kai smiled faintly and, utterly composed, let a line of words escape his mouth: "This technique is called... the Star Refining Technique!"

No sooner had the words fallen than a bright light flashed from Ai Ou's eyes, and with lightning speed he snatched the stone tablet from Yang Kai's hand, widening his eyes to scrutinize it.

The stone tablet bore three ancient characters engraved upon it, appearing profoundly mysterious and wholly different from the script in use today.

But upon close inspection, one could discern some resemblance to the three characters that made up the name Star Refining Technique.

Ai Ou's hands could not help trembling.

"Senior, you being like this... isn't this a bit unbecoming of your status?" Yang Kai teased from the side.

"Shut up!" Ai Ou barked angrily, and without the slightest intention of guarding against Yang Kai, he directly immersed his mind into the stone tablet and began to study it with full attention.

That stone tablet was something Yang Kai had taken from the deepest part of the Imperial Garden; it was precisely by means of the Star Refining Technique that he had enabled Xia Ningshang to refine the origin of the Tongxuan Continent. Although when he refined the origin of Dark Star he had not relied on this thing, it was undoubtedly the strongest method for refining a Stellar Origin.

Later, his incarnation's refinement of the Floating Continent's origin also proved this point.

Ai Ou was now at the peak of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm; if he could obtain the Star Refining Technique and refine away the origin of a Cultivation Star, it would not only open endless brightness for his future, but promotion to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm would be an absolute certainty. That was why he had lost all composure.

The last time he had sent Xue Yue with a large number of experts to the Imperial Garden, it had all been for the Star Refining Technique; unfortunately it had ultimately fallen into Yang Kai's hands.

After Xue Yue returned, she had not reported the truth, so Ai Ou did not know that the Star Refining Technique was actually with Yang Kai.

Now, upon suddenly seeing it, he was of course ecstatic.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and stood to the side, waiting.

As time passed, Ai Ou's expression shifted constantly—excited, anxious, expectant, elated... a host of emotions flashed across his face.

After a good while, he suddenly threw his head back and laughed out loud, laughing heartily.

"Senior, what have you gained?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Ai Ou turned to look at him; his face finally softened and he nodded, saying, "Young man, you are quite good. You know how to curry favor, and what's rare is your personal martial strength—your status is in no way inferior to mine, yet you still know how to show respect to your elders. I am very pleased with that!"

"I'm glad you're satisfied," Yang Kai replied.

"I'll accept this thing. As for your matter with Xue Yue... I will consider it carefully!" Ai Ou said.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and did not press the issue; Ai Ou's words signified recognition, he only had face to save.

"Come. Walk with me, I have some things I want to ask you." Ai Ou, abandoning his earlier domineering air, became much friendlier.

Yang Kai nodded and said, "As the elder commands, I dare not refuse!"

Ai Ou was extremely satisfied with his attitude, walking forward with his hands clasped behind his back, and asked, "How old are you this year?"

"This... I'm not entirely sure," Yang Kai said awkwardly. Since leaving the Tongxuan Continent and entering the Star Domain he had been tossing about with little time to count years. "About fifty or sixty."

"Fifty or sixty years old?" Ai Ou's face changed. "Are you sure you're only that old?"

Fifty or sixty? For an ordinary mortal, that's already entering an age of mellow contentment and understanding. But for a martial cultivator who has truly succeeded, fifty or sixty is merely the very beginning.

Today's Saint-Grade and Saint King-Grade cultivators—who among them did not have that sort of age?

Even some of those of poor aptitude in the Transcendent Realm or Divine Roaming Realm were considerably older.

And Yang Kai—he was at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm!

In the entire Star Domain, which Void King wasn't a centuries- or millennia-old oddity? Without the accumulation of time and experience, it was impossible to reach the Void King Realm.

So when Ai Ou learned Yang Kai was only fifty or sixty, he nearly regarded him as a marvel.

"I'll take a look at your bone-age—hope you don't mind?" Ai Ou asked suspiciously, eyeing Yang Kai.

"Of course I don't mind!" Yang Kai smiled and proactively extended his hand.

Ai Ou placed his hand on Yang Kai's wrist, sent his Divine Sense in to probe, and after a moment, shocked, withdrew his hand.

Under his probing he found Yang Kai truly was only a matter of decades old, not lying; though a cultivator's appearance did not change much with power, bone age could accurately reflect one's true years.

How had he cultivated like this? Ai Ou suddenly felt the years he had lived were wasted, and what shocked him further was that when he inspected Yang Kai's bone age he found the vigor of Yang Kai's qi and blood to be terrifying.

He suddenly realized this must be the result of Yang Kai having refined the Everlasting Tree!

Ai Ou, the chairman, believed Yang Kai had truly refined the Everlasting Tree, hence being able to reach the Second Stage of the Void King Realm in such a short time.

He drew a deep breath and said sincerely, "With your innate talent, there is no woman in this Star Domain who is fit for you. Xue Yue being chosen by you is her good fortune; having her by your side puts my mind at ease."

He finally admitted Yang Kai and Xue Yue's relationship outright.

After all, someone like Yang Kai was a once-in-eternity figure; one Xue Yue was more than sufficient as a match.

"But there is one thing I should remind you," Ai Ou suddenly remembered and said.

"Please, go on," Yang Kai replied.

"You know Xue Yue's constitution, yes?" Ai Ou asked.

"Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body." Yang Kai smiled. "Were it not for that special constitution, Xue Yue would never have been able to hide from the eyes of the entire Star Domain and pass as a man without being discovered."

"Correct. Since you know the Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body, then you must also know its greatest use," Ai Ou said.

Yang Kai nodded with a slightly odd expression.

Ai Ou cleared his throat, somewhat embarrassed, and said, "As an elder, perhaps this is improper to say, but I want to remind you—for your own good and for Xue Yue's, don't be too hasty... um, you understand. It's better to wait until Xue Yue's Martial Dao is accomplished; with your patience you'll understand."

"I understand." Yang Kai couldn't help wiping the sweat from his forehead; speaking of such matters with a future father-in-law was truly awkward.

"Ha, as long as you understand." Ai Ou patted Yang Kai's shoulder affectionately and sighed, "When one day you become a father, you'll understand why I did what I did."

Yang Kai replied solemnly, "An elder's love for his daughter is understandable."

"Good!" Ai Ou nodded. "I want to appoint you as a Guest Elder of the Hengluo Commerce Guild; will you accept?"

"No problem. Elder only wants to borrow my reputation; such a thing is no trouble," Yang Kai said.

"I already had people spread word of your contest with Zuo De in alchemy and how you dominated and even triggered the Great Dao Pill Tone. I've had it circulated everywhere—soon your name will be known throughout the Star Domain. With you as a Guest Elder of our Guild, won't the alchemists of the Star Domain rush in droves? They'll come begging to join the Guild; I won't have to kowtow to them ever again, hahahaha!" Ai Ou laughed heartily as if avenging some long-standing grievance.

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh, knowing Ai Ou had suffered many slights from temperamental alchemists.

"Also, your bet with Zuo De—those tens of Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills each year—how will those be handled? Where do you live; do you need me to have them delivered to you?" Ai Ou asked.

"No need. Consider those things my betrothal gift," Yang Kai said with a smile.

Ai Ou's eyelids tightened. "You're willing to part with them? Tens each year—over ten years that's hundreds, over a hundred years that's thousands. Those are Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills, not ordinary pills!"

"Have you forgotten I'm also an alchemist? I can refine Spiritual Pills myself."

Ai Ou gave a wry, hoarse laugh. "So it seems this betrothal gift still won't be enough for you."

Yang Kai grinned, "Add the Star Refining Technique, and my junior alchemists as well..."

"Hmm, that should be about right!" Ai Ou said joyfully.

"What if I also add a dozen or so cross-stellar Space Arrays?" Yang Kai smiled.

Ai Ou's expression turned serious and he lowered his voice, "This is what I wanted to ask: can you truly set up that sort of Space Array that can transfer directly from one star to another?"

"If you know of it, it must be from Shen Tu. Didn't Shen Tu tell you he personally tested it?" Yang Kai asked.

"Shen Tu said so, but I find it hard to believe," Ai Ou's face was grave. "Our Hengluo Commerce Guild controls numerous cultivation stars, mining stars, and Medicine Stars, eighteen in total. The yearly costs of transporting goods between those stars are astronomical. If such Space Arrays truly connected them, you would be the savior of my entire Guild. Not only could you marry Xue Yue, but if you wished you could take my other daughters as well!"

"You're joking. One Xue Yue is enough, and it's unrelated to this matter," Yang Kai said.

"Good—Xue Yue indeed has a good eye; she chose well," Ai Ou said, then suddenly ordered, "Come with me!"

With that, he charged straight forward.

Yang Kai did not know what he intended to do but did not ask; he followed closely behind.

Before long the two arrived at a heavily guarded palace; in front of the palace stood warriors clad in golden armor, and all of them were experts at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

The palace was surrounded by dense restraining formations.

Evidently this place was the heart of Shuitian City.

"Greetings, Chairman." Upon seeing Ai Ou arrive, the many guards quickly saluted.

Ai Ou nodded slightly and led Yang Kai further inward.
