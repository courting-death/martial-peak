## Chapter 1632 — Qing Ya

“Madam, Liu advises you to surrender quietly—it will spare you some suffering. I too am a cultivator and have no wish to make things hard for a woman.”
Amid the battle below, an older man shouted these words as he struck, seemingly trying to persuade the woman to give up her resistance.

Another, younger-looking man snorted coldly, “Senior Brother Liu, why waste words with her? This woman has a fine figure and pleasing looks. Once the two of us brothers seize and capture her alive, we’ll thoroughly enjoy ourselves—and then extract and absorb her vital essence, leaving her neither able to live nor able to die!”

Though the practitioners of the Fire Radiance Sect cultivated fire techniques, they possessed a clandestine method that could use the Ice Heart Valley disciples' ice Saint Yuan to break and then rebuild, allowing their cultivation to rise within an extremely short time.

The two great sects had targeted each other for countless years; many female disciples of Ice Heart Valley had mysteriously gone missing, almost always abducted by people from the Fire Radiance Sect.

The fates of those female disciples were predictable.

Although this secret technique carried certain dangers even for members of the Fire Radiance Sect, many of its disciples were not afraid; on the contrary, they clamored for it, taking pride in humiliating and harvesting Ice Heart Valley's young women.

The higher-ups of the Fire Radiance Sect always turned a blind eye.

One of the Fire Radiance Sect men played the red-faced role while the other played the black-faced role, greatly rattling the woman's spirit.

"Despicable, shameless!" the woman ground her teeth and cried out; Saint Yuan surged through her body, and countless white, jade-like birds formed from ice energy, vivid and real, their chirping filling the air as they shot out in all directions to try to obscure the two men's vision.

"Trying to run!" the younger Fire Radiance Sect disciple's expression hardened; his fire Saint Yuan swelled, making him look like a burning ball of flame—heedless, he charged straight into the birds.

Ice dissolved and disintegrated; flames roared to the heavens.

Seizing the moment, the man surnamed Liu pressed forward and blasted a fist through a gap among the flying birds.

A huge phantom of a flaming tiger suddenly manifested; its roar split the sky as it opened a blood-red maw and lunged at the woman.

The woman was pincered from both sides and looked hard-pressed; although she used every means to avert the crisis, the flaming tiger still grazed her shoulder, leaving a half-chi-long wound. Blood flowed.

Staggering, she steadied herself, only to find the two Fire Radiance Sect men leaping toward her with savage expressions.

Despair showed across her face; in her beautiful eyes a flash of longing for life appeared, but it was quickly crushed and transformed into a determination to die.

She knew that if she truly fell into the hands of the Fire Radiance Sect, the experience would be worse than death.

Thus, when Ice Heart Valley's female disciples went out, the elders would warn them: better to fall by your own hand than be captured.

Every female disciple of Ice Heart Valley kept that admonition close to heart.

"No good — this bitch wants to die!" the younger Fire Radiance Sect disciple cried out in alarm. He had fought many of Ice Heart Valley's people and recognized the signs; he knew exactly what she intended to do.

"It's not that easy to die!" the man surnamed Liu said with a wicked grin. He tossed his hand and a rope-like Secret Treasure shone with firelight, shooting out and, as if sentient, binding the woman.

He then jerked the cord back, and the woman's body was immediately cinched tight.

The tumultuous Saint Yuan fluctuations abruptly calmed; the woman stood dumbfounded, her eyes brimming with terror.

"Ha! This Binding Yuan Cord of mine was specially commissioned from a master artificer for you Ice Heart Valley people. Bound by it, don't even think of self-destructing," the man surnamed Liu said, no longer pretending. He cast an evil look at the woman, lascivious desire writ across his face.

"Kill me!" the woman struggled, but no matter how she strained she could not stir her Saint Yuan; the rope-like Secret Treasure seemed to possess a power that suppressed her Saint Yuan.

The man had not lied: this Secret Treasure had indeed been made specifically to deal with Ice Heart Valley disciples; once bound, she could not mobilize her Saint Yuan at all.

"How could I bear to kill you!" the man surnamed Liu chuckled evilly. "Catching an Ice Heart Valley disciple alive is no easy task, and you're so beautiful—I'd only begin to cherish you."

The woman's face went deathly pale; she could almost foresee the miserable fate that awaited her.

"Still want to bite your tongue and die? You wishful thinker," the younger man snorted, pointing a finger; a thread of Saint Yuan shot into the woman's body, making her go rigid and unable to speak.

"Let's leave this place first." The man surnamed Liu glanced toward the battlefield dozens of li away and had no intention of going to assist; to him, capturing a living enemy was already reward enough.

"Junior Brother will come with you," the other man said with a grin, his smile deeply suggestive.

"Naturally Junior Brother won't be left out." The man surnamed Liu understood and stepped forward to hoist the subdued woman into his arms around the waist.

Yet after taking only three steps, a blur crossed his vision—an apparition-like figure materialized before him, cutting him off between himself and the woman.

The man surnamed Liu was startled and instinctively leapt back several zhang, eyeing the newcomer warily as he called, "Friend, who are you?"

The newcomer said nothing, only staring at him coldly; the gaze carried an ice-deep chill almost palpable enough to solidify, making the fire-technique cultivator feel a chill all over.

"Senior Brother..." the younger cultivator also sensed something amiss. The suddenly appearing youth looked hostile, his eyes brimming with murderous intent—clearly not one of their own.

The man surnamed Liu frowned, then his eyes widened and he cried out, "It's you!"

He had evidently recognized the newcomer's identity.

No sooner had he spoken than he wasted no time, unleashing his movement technique to flee into the distance.

The other man hesitated briefly and dared not linger either; he turned into a streak of firelight and attempted to escape as well.

The newcomer was hostile and his cultivation had already reached the Origin Returning Realm; they could not confront him. Although loath to give up the woman, their own lives mattered more.

Moreover, both had recognized the newcomer as the very fellow they'd been searching for; their first task was to report this discovery, not to bother with anything else.

Their speed was extraordinary; in the blink of an eye they had already run a few hundred zhang.

The youth seemed unconcerned. Only when their figures were about to vanish from sight did he leisurely reach out and flick his fingers twice.

Two sharp sounds of air being split seemed to follow.

Far off, two abrupt, agonized screams were heard; the fleeing Fire Radiance Sect disciples froze as if struck by lightning, then fell.

The subdued woman stood stunned, her gaze fixed unblinking on the man's back; for a moment that silhouette seemed as broad as a river, as majestic as a mountain, and her heart swelled with gratitude.

She had not expected that at such a critical moment an expert would come to her aid.

Ice Heart Valley had no male disciples; she did not know whether this man belonged to one of the sects affiliated with Ice Heart Valley.

She tried to open her mouth to thank him, but sealed by the Fire Radiance Sect disciples earlier, only incoherent sounds came out—she could not form a single word.

Yet... why did the man's back look so familiar? She felt as if she had seen him somewhere before.

Doubt gnawed at her heart.

After killing the two Fire Radiance Sect men, the murderous aura on the man's body quickly dissipated; he turned and looked at the woman with a complicated expression.

When their eyes met, the woman froze as if petrified, staring at the face of the man who had suddenly appeared and saved her; her beautiful eyes trembled violently.

She could hardly believe her own eyes!

Yang Kai sighed, "Senior Qing Ya, long time no see."

As he spoke, he swept his hand and severed the Binding Yuan Cord that had bound her. Freed of the Secret Treasure's constraint, Qing Ya only needed to stir her Saint Yuan once to shatter the seal within her body, yet she still stared at him, stunned, unable to utter a word.

She had never expected that her rescuer would be Yang Kai!

This Yang Kai had not shown himself in the past year yet his actions had stirred the affairs of the entire Chi Lan Star into strange turbulence.

Yet now, she found herself unable to see through his strength at all. That could only mean his cultivation was at least one great realm higher than her own! Only such an immense gap could render his true cultivation utterly indiscernible to her.

How had he grown so quickly?

Qing Ya had thought Su Yan's growth was already terrifying enough. After leaving Tongxuan Continent together, Su Yan had once been weaker than her, but upon entering the Star Domain Su Yan later surpassed her, advancing at an astonishing pace to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Yang Kai seemed to be at an even higher cultivation than Su Yan.

Where had he been all these years? How had he trained?

Qing Ya's thoughts fell into a haze.

After a long moment she recovered and asked uncertainly, "Yang Kai? Is it really you?"

"It's me." Yang Kai nodded lightly.

He had not expected to meet the former Ice Lord Qing Ya on Chi Lan Star.

At the instant he saw her, Yang Kai almost thought he was dreaming.

Qing Ya had been with Su Yan; if Qing Ya was here, then where was Su Yan? Was she here as well? Yang Kai's heart trembled with anxious expectation.

"Senior Qing Ya, Su Yan—" Yang Kai inhaled deeply and asked in a dry voice, afraid of hearing a disappointing answer.

"Su Yan is fine; you need not worry," Qing Ya's reply sent a great weight from Yang Kai's chest tumbling away.

More than thirty years had passed since they parted! This separation was different from the parting with Xia Ningshang; though Yang Kai had not seen Xia Ningshang for many years, he knew she remained on Tongxuan Continent, waiting for him.

Su Yan was different; for all these years Yang Kai had no idea where she was, how she fared, or whether she was safe.

That uncertainty was a torment far worse than longing.

Qing Ya's single sentence made him laugh, a smile full of the relief of a great burden lifted.

"So you really were together?" Yang Kai asked again. "Where is she now?"

"She's not here; she is in Ice Heart Valley."

"Ice Heart Valley? You joined Ice Heart Valley?" Yang Kai was stunned.
