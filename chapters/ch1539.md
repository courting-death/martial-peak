## Chapter 1539 — Sect Master

"It's that brat!" Upon hearing Liang Yong's question, Shan Ying pointed with his hand, gritting his teeth: "It's him. He plainly doesn't regard our Lingxiao Sect. I already told him very clearly that Bibo City is under the jurisdiction of Lingxiao Sect, and I'm someone loyal to Lord Liang, yet that brat acts high and mighty, brazen and presumptuous, he simply doesn't believe me—Lord Liang, please teach him a good lesson."

After speaking, Shan Ying looked at Yang Kai with blatant smugness; his gaze brimmed with satisfaction and expectation.

He was eager to see Yang Kai kneel and beg for mercy, so he could vent all the malice in his heart.

To his disappointment, Yang Kai showed no panic or fluster; he remained as calm as ever, standing with his arms folded across his chest, a faint, inscrutable cold smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, his eyes arrogantly fixed on Liang Yong.

The brat truly had guts! With the city lord himself present, he showed no fear—Shan Ying couldn't help but feel a measure of admiration for Yang Kai.

But his utter disregard would only enrage Lord Liang further; the outcome would surely be even more tragic.

Shan Ying sneered inwardly and cast a deliberate glance at Liang Yong, just in time to see him take a great stride and rush toward Yang Kai.

Shan Ying's eyes widened, secretly anticipating a good show.

Cold sweat gathered in the palms of the green-clad girl and the others, their faces filled with panic. The countless cultivators who had just stood behind Yang Kai in support, upon seeing Liang Yong’s overbearing aura, instinctively retreated a few steps, putting some distance between themselves and Yang Kai—afraid of getting caught up in the flames of another’s battle.

Some already quietly regretted acting so rashly earlier.

They had long heard of Liang Yong's great name.

After the Battle Sky Alliance was annihilated, he became the city lord of Battle Sky City and was directly under the management of Lingxiao Sect.

Although Lingxiao Sect's renown had spread these past years, they seemed low-key in their deeds—no one had ever heard of a Lingxiao Sect disciple appearing publicly. Liang Yong, however, seemed to have become Lingxiao Sect's spokesperson to the outside world!

Now that he had arrived, regardless of his personal strength, he represented the massive power that was Lingxiao Sect.

Even if he were just an ordinary person, no one would dare lay hands on him. Moreover, he was a top expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his strength far surpassing Shan Ying's.

The brat was done for!

Many looked toward Yang Kai with pity in their faces. No matter how big a backing the brat had, if he were to die horribly here today, no one would dare avenge him.

In the blink of an eye the over ten zhang distance was closed; Liang Yong hurried up to Yang Kai without pause, flung his garment back, dropped to one knee and bowed his head, his voice low and steady: "Your subordinate Liang Yong pays respects to the Sect Master!"

The motion was clean and brisk, as if rehearsed countless times without the slightest hesitation.

Yang Kai's expression was indifferent as he looked down upon him from above; the cold smile at his lips remained unchanged, inscrutable.

A thousand eyes seemed to jump in chaos.

Everyone who witnessed the scene gaped, eyes wide, hardly daring to believe their own eyes or ears, as if placed in a dream.

The scene fell into a hushed silence, yet an invisible chill seemed to shroud the front of the city lord's mansion, making many feel as if they'd fallen into an ice cellar.

Shan Ying stood dumbfounded, staring at Liang Yong with his face full of astonishment.

He suddenly noticed fine beads of sweat appearing on Liang Yong's brow, coalescing into droplets and sliding down his cheeks.

Drip, drip…

Shan Ying's body trembled violently; a flash of insight struck his mind as he abruptly remembered some information he'd heard before.

It was said that the Lingxiao Sect's Sect Master Yang Kai seemed to be a young man; based on the various descriptions he'd heard, there was a vague resemblance to the troublemaker before him...

And the way Liang Yong had addressed him just now seemed to be...

Shan Ying's eyes rolled back and he nearly fainted.

“We pay our respects to the Sect Master! We did not know the Sect Master would grace us with his presence and have failed to welcome you from afar—may the Sect Master forgive our offense!” The unified shout burst from the throats of the cultivators Liang Yong had brought, echoing through heaven and earth, shaking the very hearts of all who heard it.

The green-clad girl froze again, staring at Yang Kai blankly; it took her a long moment to seem to understand, and a peculiar light lit her lovely eyes.

"Liang Yong..." Yang Kai called lightly.

"Your subordinate is present," Liang Yong hurriedly replied, his voice trembling slightly.

"You have done well these years," Yang Kai said with a faint cold laugh.

"Your subordinate dares not!" Liang Yong's cold sweat kept falling from his brow; he looked as if he had been plucked from water, his clothes soaked through with sweat. Hearing the discontent in Yang Kai's words, he hurriedly said, "Your subordinate failed in disciplining my subordinates, causing trouble for the Sect Master—please punish me!"

"Mm, punishing you can wait, but this Sect Master is rather curious—when did you join Lingxiao Sect? Who took you in before I gave my word?"

Liang Yong's body trembled; with a sidelong glance he shot a venomous look at Shan Ying, the hatred in his heart indescribable.

He had just received intelligence in Battle Sky City that trouble was brewing here, so he brought a group through the Space Array to the scene. He never expected that the moment he stepped out of the city lord's mansion he would see the person he feared most in his life.

He wanted nothing more than to tear Shan Ying, that blind fool, limb from limb.

"Sect Master, please judge: your subordinate looks upon the sect's grandeur and longed to join, to die for the sect, yet never had the chance. I was fortunate to receive the Sect Master's favor and became city lord of Battle Sky City to manage matters for the Sect and to gather supplies. But I am only a survivor of the Battle Sky Alliance; afraid I could not command the masses, I publicly declared things as I did out of necessity—Deputy City Lord Ge was aware of this." Liang Yong reflected briefly before reporting hurriedly.

"Is that so, Xiao Qi? Is this true?" Yang Kai looked toward a buck-toothed martial artist in the crowd.

The latter nodded.

"Well then, let it be," Yang Kai lightly inclined his head.

Hearing this, Liang Yong could not help but exhale.

He had not yet relaxed when Yang Kai continued, "Let's talk about Bibo City."

Liang Yong's heart tightened, an ominous feeling running from head to foot.

"I've heard that Bibo City is subordinate to Battle Sky City?" Yang Kai asked Liang Yong.

"Sect Master, yes. Not only Bibo City, but all the cities within a radius of several million li are subordinate to Battle Sky City—about nine cities in total, large and small!" Liang Yong replied.

"Not bad work," Yang Kai smiled.

"Thank you for the compliment, Sect Master. Serving the Sect is my honor."

"So that means Bibo City's every action is dictated by Battle Sky City?" Yang Kai asked with a smile directed at Liang Yong.

Liang Yong looked flustered and hurried to explain, "Not exactly. I merely have those subordinate cities pay some supplies or Saint Crystal each year; I do not interfere with the internal affairs of their cities. Each is still managed by its own city lord's mansion."

"A decent answer," Yang Kai said with layered meaning in his smile.

"Sect Master..." Ge Qi looked at Yang Kai with suspicion. "Has something happened in Bibo City?"

"I only arrived here today and don't know much; if you want to know more, ask these people." Yang Kai gestured toward the countless spectators.

Ge Qi pondered, sensing that the matter was not simple. He hurried forward, coming before the crowd and cupped his fists: "Everyone, I am Ge Qi, Deputy City Lord of Battle Sky City and a disciple of Lingxiao Sect. If any of you have grievances, tell me—Ge will guarantee in the name of the Sect that no one shall trouble you."

The scene fell silent. No one spoke; all stared at Ge Qi in a daze.

They were afraid and did not trust Ge Qi, and naturally had no courage to expose the city lord's mansion's dirty secrets.

The green-clad girl opened her mouth as if to speak, then swallowed the words.

"Fei'er, speak up—I'm here. No one dares lay a hand on you," Yang Kai read the situation and soothed her.

Encouraged, the green-clad girl drew a deep breath and said in a soft voice, "Fei'er's fourth uncle refused to pay Saint Crystals and was beaten to death by the city lord's mansion people two years ago!"

"And today, they tried to seize the earnings we had risked our lives to obtain. They even tried to take Fei'er herself—if Eldest Brother Yang Kai hadn't intervened, the consequences would have been unthinkable," another young man shouted.

Ge Qi's face darkened.

“Bibo City isn’t a place for people to live—seventy percent of all earnings have to be handed over to the City Lord’s Mansion. We can’t survive like this!”

"There is a roster in the city lord's mansion. Those listed are forbidden from leaving Bibo City, and anyone discovered trying to leave is killed without mercy. Many who tried to flee have already died."

At first a smattering of shouts arose, and soon countless voices blurted out together.

Ge Qi's expression grew ever grimmer, and Yang Kai's face likewise darkened with cold fury.

After a long while the clamor began to subside. Yang Kai and Ge Qi exchanged a look and each could see the other's wrath.

What Bibo City had done was vicious, but in such a vast Dark Star there would always be places like this. What angered Yang Kai, however, was that Bibo City used Lingxiao Sect's name to cloak their deeds.

Otherwise, the city lord's mansion would long since have been flattened by countless warriors.

Lingxiao Sect's great prestige meant that even if complaints rang out, no one dared resist.

This smeared Lingxiao Sect's name; if it continued, Lingxiao Sect would have no standing left on Dark Star.

Within Battle Sky City's jurisdiction of several million li, there were nine cities. If Bibo City acted like this, what of the other cities?

"Xiao Qi, you're doing a poor job as deputy city lord!" Yang Kai shot him a glance.

Ge Qi looked ashamed.

He had not expected the situation outside to be like this.

Since Yang Kai had left three years ago and left him as deputy city lord, Ge Qi had not left Battle Sky City; he lived a withdrawn life and only occasionally watched over the city's affairs.

Battle Sky City had strictly followed the measures Yang Kai issued when he left—taxes were nearly negligible, attracting many martial artists to settle. The city now teemed with people and prosperity.

But the other cities under Battle Sky City's rule were not like that.

Beneath that polished facade, there were those who secretly engaged in vile, heart-corrupting deeds.

Fortunately Yang Kai discovered it early; otherwise the consequences would have been unthinkable. The thought made Ge Qi break into a cold sweat and burn with anger.
