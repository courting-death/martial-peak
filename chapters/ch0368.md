## Chapter 368 — I Have Always Been Mistaken 

This person... is interesting.

To actually ask the direct descendant of the Yang Family for help in rebuilding this wasteland, and even arrogantly claim to show off his skills.

The place where Yang Kai wants to show off is Zhongdu, where the battle for succession of the Yang Family takes place! It is certainly not here.

"Are these two your friends?" Jie Hongchen directed his gaze toward Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, asking lightly.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian’s expressions shifted slightly, but they did not speak. As Blood Servants of the Yang Family, their status was lower than that of Yang Kai, and naturally they were not qualified to be called his friends. However, Yang Kai straightforwardly acknowledged them, which stirred something in their hearts.

Jie Hongchen smiled, seeming somewhat unconcerned, and said, “Since they are Brother Yang's friends, they are also friends of Lingxiao Pavilion. If the two of you don’t mind, you can help as well; naturally, there will be benefits for you.”

The brows of the two Blood Servants furrowed slightly, their expressions turning playful.

They exchanged glances, both seeing the urge to laugh in each other's eyes.

Although they were Blood Servants of the Yang Family, lower in status than the sons of the family, that only held true within the Yang Family. Once outside, even elders of first-rate forces would not dare treat them casually, let alone order them about.

Yet this kid wants them to help rebuild Lingxiao Pavilion and expects to offer benefits?

To satisfy the Blood Servants of the Yang Family with benefits, that is not something ordinary people could provide. Where did this kid get such confidence?

Jie Hongchen had already looked up at the sky. After a moment, his brow could not help but furrow. “Which eagle is making such a noise? It’s quite annoying.”

Yang Kai could not help but pinch his nose; Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian’s expressions were becoming increasingly strange.

The Golden Feather Eagle had followed Yang Kai back here and was now soaring in the sky, its cries naturally drawing Jie Hongchen's attention.

Jie Hongchen nodded slightly, a hint of appreciation in his eyes. “That eagle is indeed majestic.”

Saying this, he turned and called to someone nearby, “Senior Aunt Zhong.”

A middle-aged woman, around forty or fifty years old, immediately walked over. She was also a member of Lingxiao Pavilion, but from the previous generation of disciples, and currently had the cultivation of the First Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, which was not too shabby. “Is there something the junior needs?”

Jie Hongchen pointed to the Golden Feather Eagle in the sky and asked, “With your skills, can you bring that eagle down? It might disturb the two girls.”

The Senior Aunt looked up at him, and after a moment shook her head. “It’s too high, and that eagle seems quite powerful. I’m afraid I cannot help.”

Jie Hongchen frowned slightly, his expression somewhat displeased. He waved his hand. “Then forget it, you can go about your business.”

“Mm.”

Once the person left, Jie Hongchen smiled faintly. “It seems I will have to deal with that myself. Brother Yang, please wait a moment. I will take care of that eagle and then we can speak.”

“Oh.” Yang Kai simply nodded nonchalantly.

In the next moment, Jie Hongchen soared into the air, flying straight toward the Golden Feather Eagle.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had no intention of stopping him; they merely watched with expressions of anticipation.

If the Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family was so easily caught or brought down, it would not be a beast nurtured by the Yang Family.

“Does this person have a grudge against the young master?” Tang Yuxian smiled at Yang Kai, her eyes sparkling. She had noticed Jie Hongchen's earlier attitude toward Yang Kai and now seemed intent on showcasing his abilities in front of him, clearly suggesting they had some sort of past conflict.

“It’s all in the past!” Yang Kai said calmly, shaking his head gently.

The conflicts with Jie Hongchen were merely internal strife within the sect. Now that the sect was gone, Yang Kai had long since stopped thinking about those past events.

“Where did that eagle come from?” While observing Jie Hongchen, an urgent question suddenly came from beside them.

Moments later, two beautiful figures quickly approached from a distance.

The leading figure was in her twenties, tall, with bright eyes and white teeth, her skin fair as snow, with a waist that could be grasped with a hand, dressed in a purple long gown that accentuated her noble demeanor.

Beside her was a seemingly younger, delicate-looking woman, petite yet with an impressive bosom that seemed ready to burst free from her attire, her face flushed as she hurried along. With every step, her curves swayed, making it seem as though anyone who glanced would be drawn into an inescapable charm.

Both pairs of beautiful eyes were fixed on the Golden Feather Eagle in the sky, their expressions heavy. It was as if they were not looking at an eagle soaring but a monstrous being.

As the two women walked out, all the busy disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, regardless of gender or age, ceased their actions and respectfully greeted, “We greet Miss Qiu, we greet Miss Luo!”

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman remained indifferent, still staring intently at the sky, halting their steps, lost in thought.

“Sister Qiu, is that really the eagle?” Luo Xiaoman asked softly, still carrying an innocent demeanor.

“Should be,” Qiu Yimeng replied with a serious nod. “But I’ve only heard of it and never seen it myself.”

“That Jie Hongchen has flown up there,” Luo Xiaoman pointed at the sky.

“What does this fool want to do?” Qiu Yimeng's gaze turned cold, her pretty face icy. “Could it be he wishes to kill that eagle?”

Was that eagle something anyone could kill indiscriminately? Even injuring it would probably lead to a lot of trouble. Although she had long known Jie Hongchen liked to show off, at this moment Qiu Yimeng thought he was nothing short of foolish.

Anyone with a discerning eye could probably tell that this eagle was extraordinary, right?

“Miss Qiu?” Tang Yuxian looked at Qiu Yimeng with suspicion, calling gently.

When Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman walked over together, Yang Kai and the two Blood Servants were taken aback.

Nobody had expected to encounter the two of them here.

Yang Kai knew they had been controlled by Shan Qingluo, while Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were unaware that Qiu Yimeng had gone missing since her last visit to Lingxiao Pavilion.

After carefully observing Qiu Yimeng for a moment, Tang Yuxian confirmed that this was the young lady from the Qiu Family who had gone missing for several months!

She couldn't help but exclaim.

Upon hearing, Qiu Yimeng quickly turned her head to look, and upon seeing Yang Kai, her expression froze.

Luo Xiaoman was so frightened her complexion paled, quickly hiding behind Qiu Yimeng and glaring at Yang Kai.

“Mm?” Tu Feng was immediately puzzled, his expression turning strange, as if he felt this Qiu Family young lady knew their young master.

After a long while, Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly at Yang Kai, her gaze turning toward Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian as she looked them over.

Tang Yuxian recognized her, but she did not know Tang Yuxian. However, as she saw the jade tokens at the waists of the two Blood Servants, her pretty face changed, and she exclaimed, “Blood Servants of the Yang Family?”

“Greetings, Miss Qiu.” Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian hurriedly saluted.

In terms of status, Qiu Yimeng was equivalent to Yang Kai, and one could argue her status was even higher, for she was a once-in-a-century genius of the Qiu Family, highly regarded among the younger generation in Zhongdu, while Yang Kai was merely a disciple who had yet to return to the family.

Facing such a person, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian could afford no negligence.

Qiu Yimeng's expression changed several times as her gaze moved back and forth among the three of them. After a long while, she locked onto Yang Kai, bursting into a smile. “So, the Blood Servants of the Yang Family are here, along with the unique Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family. Then you must be a direct descendant of the Yang Family?”

Given this context, if Qiu Yimeng still did not know Yang Kai's true identity, she would no longer be Qiu Yimeng.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded.

“So I have been mistaken all along,” Qiu Yimeng thought bitterly. Although she understood that Yang Kai had not revealed his identity due to the regulations of the Yang Family, it still left her somewhat unsettled.

Ironically, back when she was at Shan Qingluo's palace, she had even proposed generous conditions to recruit Yang Kai into the Qiu Family, to serve the Qiu Family.

He was already a direct descendant of the Yang Family, so what was there to recruit?

No wonder at that time he wasn’t moved in the slightest; Qiu Yimeng had thought he was high-minded and aloof, but now it seemed he had never considered it at all, nor needed to.

With gritted teeth, Qiu Yimeng glared at Yang Kai, wishing she could peel his skin off and relieve her embarrassment.

No one had ever made her suffer this way.

“You are a son of the Yang Family?” Luo Xiaoman was also stunned, staring blankly at Yang Kai.

“Of course he is!” Qiu Yimeng sneered lightly.

Luo Xiaoman was suddenly left speechless, unsure of what to say.

She still remembered that Qiu Yimeng had once commented on Yang Kai, saying it was fortunate he did not have a powerful background; if he did, the entire realm would likely be turned upside down by him.

Now it appeared that not only did he have a powerful background, but it was also very profound! Simply unrivaled.

“Do the two of you know our young master?” Tang Yuxian inquired, a hint of curiosity in her beautiful eyes as she looked at Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman.

As a woman, she detected an unusual flavor from their conversation. It seemed her young master had some extraordinary entanglement with these two girls.

“We know, of course we know!” Qiu Yimeng replied with a charming smile, lightly biting her lip.

Tu Feng involuntarily shuddered, not knowing why he felt a chill run down his spine.

“Is it necessary for you to look at me with such hatred? I don’t owe you anything,” Yang Kai said, helplessly smiling at Qiu Yimeng, acutely aware of the hostility radiating from her.

“Owe us nothing?” Qiu Yimeng laughed coldly, “You owe a lot.”

These words sounded extremely ambiguous in the ears of Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, who immediately wore expectant expressions, utterly intrigued.

“Do you want me to count them out one by one?” Qiu Yimeng stared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai appeared utterly unconcerned. “You may say; I'm listening.”

“Good.” Qiu Yimeng smiled broadly, her eyes sparkling with cunning as she pressed her lips together and said, “Then let’s start with Shan...”

“Hey...” Yang Kai's expression changed, and he quickly rushed forward, covering her mouth with his hand.
