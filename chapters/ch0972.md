## Chapter 972 — Ke Luo's Might

The earth split and mountains collapsed; a blinding radiance erupted, making the whole heaven and earth tremble.

The skeletal hand shattered into fragments with a sound, and before the pieces could even hit the ground, they vanished.

Li Rong's lithe body trembled; a flush rose on her fair face — in the clash with Ke Luo's power, she had clearly taken a slight loss.

But before anyone noticed, the other experts around Yang Kai had already disappeared.

Changyuan reappeared in a strange fashion, materializing to Ke Luo's right. He wrapped himself in a billow of black cloud, gripping a pitch-black long halberd. The halberd was jet-dark from tip to shaft, radiating a heart-stopping energy fluctuation as if capable of devouring all light.

The halberd thrust, breaching the bonds of space, driving toward Ke Luo's ribs.

The blow was eerily silent, yet it was the full eruption of Changyuan's greatest power!

Only at this moment did this present-age Demon Lord reveal his full strength; Yang Kai felt a stir within.

At the halberd's tip were condensed his profound intent and Demon Yuan, converging into an assault that could rend heaven and earth.

"Trifling tricks!" Ke Luo seemed to have noticed long ago; with a cold snort, unhurried and unmoving, a ghastly white Bone Shield suddenly floated to his side.

The halberd struck the Bone Shield and an earth-shattering energy erupted. Changyuan staggered back a dozen steps, and the Bone Shield shattered in response.

Ke Luo remained unscathed. Changyuan's eyes filled with disbelief — he had never imagined the leader of the Bone Clan to be so overwhelmingly powerful.

His present strength, though not yet at the Saint King Realm, absolutely towered above this world; even the ever-proud Changyuan could only grudgingly admit inferiority.

Ominous winds howled; amid the wails, over a dozen skulls suddenly materialized beside Ke Luo. Those skulls stretched in the wind until they were the size of houses, moving like the gale and encircling Changyuan. From their eye sockets and jaws, streams of arcane might shot forth, assailing from all directions toward the center.

Their intent was to cleave Changyuan down!

Changyuan froze; before he could dodge, a beam of arcane energy struck his body. Pain flickered across his face — even his robust demonic physique struggled to withstand such a violent onslaught.

No longer daring to slacken, he hurriedly evaded. Meng Wuya appeared in a flash; surging Saint Yuan erupted from his body to intercept wave after wave of attacks for Changyuan. Changyuan understood and wordlessly cooperated, brandishing the halberd as black energy spheres met the ghostly lights spitting from the skulls.

Two mortal enemies who had clashed for centuries now cooperated more effectively than anyone else in that instant.

"Back then a Saint King here struck me down with a single blow and left me grievously wounded — let's see how much of his true art you lot acquired!" Ke Luo roared. From his sleeve shot a jade-green cord that seemed to have a life of its own; while flying it swelled, growing larger than the golden dragon Yang Kai had manifested.

When its true form was finally revealed, everyone saw that it was nothing more than a Secret Treasure.

No one knew how, over these thousands of years, he had maintained the treasure's potency without decay.

It was simply that the likeness was far too lifelike, appearing just like a winged serpent with fins at its cheeks.

The flying-snake Secret Treasure appeared and pressed down on Yang Kai with tremendous force, giving him the illusion of a mountain crushing his skull; his body grew unbearably heavy and each step was arduous.

The flying serpent danced through the air, ripples spreading out from its body in waves, carrying an extraordinary power of Law that bound everyone like ropes.  

At that moment, the few experts who remained all felt as though their hands and feet were shackled, as if mired in a swamp—movement difficult, and the flow of power within their bodies sluggish and unresponsive.

Chu Lingxiao stepped forward to confront the Secret Treasure, invoking the Locking Demon Chain. Golden light burst forth, blocking those concentric ripples.

Great Lord Lei Long hurried up as well, unleashing flame and thunder; together with Chu Lingxiao they managed to stem the Secret Treasure's momentum.

Ke Luo himself did not move — merely relying on a dozen skulls and a flying-snake Secret Treasure, he restrained the era's four top experts.

Those four unleashed all their skill and could only barely cope; they had no surplus strength left to directly assault Ke Luo himself.

Only Li Rong remained constantly guarding Yang Kai's side.

Ke Luo turned his gaze to Yang Kai and smiled coldly, "You should have fled — fled far away — yet you stayed. To die by my hand, you have cause to be proud."

Saying this with leisurely composure, he walked step by step toward Yang Kai.

As he drew near, Li Rong's expression grew increasingly grave; a strange pressure made her bones creak as if they might collapse at any moment.

Yang Kai sensed something amiss as a nightmare-like whisper suddenly rose: "Enter Demonic State!"

His True Yang Yuan Qi frantically retreated into his Dantian; his meridians and flesh were flooded with thick Demon Yuan. Invisible Demon Marks crawled up and imprinted into his flesh, disappearing inward and converging into an earth-shattering formation within him.

The force of his qi and blood surged wildly; his inner power fluctuations spiked, and even the pulse of life within him became incomparably more vigorous than before.

Ke Luo paused and looked at Yang Kai with surprise. For an instant, the youth who should only possess the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm seemed like someone of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, and Ke Luo could not help but be moved.

"So you can draw on such external force — not bad!" Ke Luo slightly nodded, offering a pretentious comment, then sneered, "But you will still die. Short of the Saint King Realm, no one can withstand me!"

He casually thrust out a palm; an invisible pressure surged toward Yang Kai, as if to grind him to powder.

Yang Kai shoved Li Rong behind him and likewise thrust out a palm.

A colossal palm print bore down, blotting out the entire sky.

The Heaven-Covering Palm — a single hand that hides the heavens!

And Yang Kai executed the Heaven-Covering Palm while in the Demonic State; its force was peerless.

Boom……

A thunderous detonation shook everyone's eardrums; visible shockwaves rolled out in all directions, turning the sea into a tsunami of disaster.

"Huh?" Ke Luo moved again; he had not expected the youth to so easily receive his blow without the slightest sign of injury.

He knew how powerful his attack was. Even if that youth appeared to possess Third Stage of the Saint Realm power, it was only an illusion borrowed from outside.

In truth he was merely a weak Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm practitioner.

Yet he still withstood Ke Luo's attack — the only explanation was that his body could fully utilize the borrowed external force!

What a formidable physique that must be.

Ke Luo's eyes brightened; an intense interest in Yang Kai's flesh grew within him. He thought that if he could absorb the essence of Yang Kai's flesh and blood, his own power would certainly rise considerably.

Yang Kai gave him no time to savor the thought. Black spears condensed in his hands and were hurled crazily in that direction.

Li Rong's delicate form followed closely behind the swarm of spears, seeking an opening to strike Ke Luo a grievous blow.

The ghastly Bone Shield reappeared, condensing again before Ke Luo.

That Bone Shield seemed nothing but a condensation of his internal energy, inexhaustible and boundless.

The Heaven-Slaying Spear rained down on the Bone Shield; shield after shield was shattered, yet not a hair on Ke Luo was harmed.

Seeing the situation worsen, Li Rong thrust out both hands and spewed two Demon Yuan serpents from her sleeves, their fangs bared as they lunged for Ke Luo's eyes. She then withdrew in tandem and returned to Yang Kai's side — the two of them's joint strike achieved no result.

Ke Luo smiled faintly, "Is that all you've got? If this is all you can do, you're doomed."

“You sure do prattle on!” Yang Kai said with an impatient look, his voice dripping with mockery.

At the same time he urgently signaled Li Rong: "His target is the Blood Essence Stone in my hand — he wants to seize the blood-energy inside to help his own breakthrough. Don't worry about me for the moment; hurry to help Shopkeeper Meng and Changyuan. If you can smash that long-snake Secret Treasure and those skulls and force them to disengage, we can surround and finish off this Ke Luo."

Li Rong froze for a moment, then instantly understood Yang Kai's plan.

The four top experts were fully occupied; with only her and Yang Kai fighting side by side, they couldn't possibly handle the Bone Clan leader. But if they could bring the other four together and strike him with six at once, even his ferocity likely wouldn't hold.

After all, he had not yet reached the Saint King Realm!

Hesitation flitted across Li Rong's pretty face. "But…"

"No buts — go now!" Yang Kai barked.

A flicker of struggle crossed Li Rong's beautiful eyes.

Li Rong was the mistress of the entire Ancient Demon Clan; she would naturally protect Yang Kai at every moment, yet she also knew the correctness of Yang Kai's plan and was momentarily at a loss.

If something were to happen to Yang Kai…

She could hardly bear to imagine it.

Her gaze hardened and, gritting her teeth, she said, "Be careful, my lord!"

Saying so, she flickered and dashed first toward Changyuan and Meng Wuya.

The two were driven with no escape by more than a dozen skulls, fleeing through the sky above the sea to dodge those terrifying ghostly lights. Yet in their flight they had shattered two of the skulls — not too bad a loss.

Li Rong decided to help them first; if those two could free themselves and aid Lei Long and Chu Lingxiao, the flying-snake Secret Treasure would be no great threat.

Watching Li Rong flee, Ke Luo tilted his head and leisurely looked at Yang Kai, utterly unconcerned with stopping her.

He seemed to see through Yang Kai's design and sneered, "I'll kill you before they arrive!"

"Then try," Yang Kai grinned, "see if you can catch me!"

Ke Luo slowly shook his head. "Don't think of using your Star Shuttle against me — it won't work. I reminded you last time I saw you."

He paused then added, "And don't think of tearing open space; I've sealed this realm with my mind. Your cultivation is lower than mine — that technique cannot be used. If I'd known you had that ability before, I wouldn't have let you escape last time!"

"I never planned on tearing space anyway," Yang Kai chuckled oddly.

"Then how do you intend to stall me?" Ke Luo seemed very curious about what else Yang Kai might be hiding and showed no hurry to strike.

"Guess!" Yang Kai's eyes sharpened. Wind power surged around him and arcs of electricity danced across his body; wind and thunder bolstered him, and suddenly a pair of almost-transparent wings appeared on his back.

Wind-and-Thunder Wings!
