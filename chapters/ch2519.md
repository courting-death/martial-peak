## Chapter 2519 — Jia Si

It was only a month and a half ago that Gao Xueting suddenly told her she had found some clues, but would need to join forces with someone else to unravel them. That day, she left behind some cultivation resources, departed from Kunyuan City, and vanished without a trace.

Seven days ago, Qingyang Pavilion was suddenly surrounded by the City Lord’s mansion’s guards. Those guards never said what crime Qingyang Pavilion had supposedly committed; they simply encircled the place, forbidding anyone from entering.

At this point, Lu Wen suddenly started, belatedly realizing, “Senior Brother Yang, how did you get in? The City Lord’s mansion’s people should still be outside.”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “If I want to come in, how could that rabble possibly stop me?” Pausing, he frowned. “Elder Gao left here a month and a half ago, saying she needed to join forces with someone to unravel the secret of that beast hide. But seven days ago, this place was inexplicably surrounded by the City Lord’s mansion’s people…”

Lu Wen said anxiously, “So Junior Sister suspects Elder Gao may have run into some danger. The reason they surrounded Qingyang Pavilion was to prevent me from sending any messages outside. After all, Elder Gao didn’t hide her comings and goings at Qingyang Pavilion in recent days, so it would be easy to find out she was connected to it.”

Yang Kai nodded. “You’re right. If that’s the case… then Kunyuan City can’t be uninvolved.”

Lu Wen said with a touch of melancholy, “I truly had no other choice, so I used my own token to send a message—just grasping at straws, never expecting that it would actually bring Senior Brother Yang here.”

Yang Kai said, “I only happened to be passing by because I had business nearby.”

If not for Yang Kai passing by Kunyuan City by chance, Lu Wen’s message would never have reached a fellow disciple, no matter how many times she tried. After all, this is the Eastern Territory, extremely far from Qingyang Shrine, and the people from the Shrine wouldn’t come here for no reason.

Although Gao Xueting always had a cold demeanor, she had always treated Yang Kai well. That Qingyang Gold Token was even personally handed to Yang Kai by her, and she had once considered taking him as a disciple to teach him cultivation.

Now that Gao Xueting might be in trouble, Yang Kai naturally couldn’t stand by and do nothing.

Of course, this was only a guess. It could also be a misunderstanding, but the City Lord’s mansion’s people surrounding Qingyang Pavilion was rather suspicious. If not for Gao Xueting, why would they surround this place for no reason?

“From the looks of it, the City Lord’s mansion must be deeply involved in this matter,” Yang Kai mused, his thoughts gradually becoming clearer.

Lu Wen said, “Junior Sister thinks so too. Elder Gao previously said she needed to find someone to help unravel the secret of that beast hide, and in Kunyuan City, only the City Lord, Zu Hong, has First Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation. If Elder Gao wanted to join forces, Zu Hong would be the obvious choice.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and grinned. “Since we have a suspect, that makes things much easier.”

“Senior Brother Yang, what are you planning to do?” Lu Wen saw his wicked smile and suddenly had a bad feeling.

“What else? Naturally, I’ll ask him face to face.” Yang Kai snorted.

Lu Wen exclaimed, “Senior Brother, you mustn’t be reckless! That Zu Hong is a First Stage Emperor Realm expert, and he’s been at that level for over forty years—his strength is formidable. He also has an Imperial Treasure at his side. Even though you’re an Elite Disciple of the Shrine, facing an Emperor… I’m afraid…”

She didn’t finish her sentence, but her meaning was obvious.

She thought Yang Kai was no match for Zu Hong.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Junior Sister. Someone like Zu Hong isn’t worth my concern.” After a brief pause, he instructed Zhang Ruoxi, “In a moment, take Junior Sister Lu and leave Kunyuan City through the back gate. Wait for me outside the city. Since things have come to this, there’s no reason to stay here any longer. Junior Sister, you should return to the Shrine as soon as possible.”

“Yes, sir!” Zhang Ruoxi replied solemnly.

Only then did Yang Kai’s figure blur and suddenly vanish.

“This…” Lu Wen was left dumbfounded, both shocked and anxious. She had clearly explained everything to this Senior Brother Yang—Zu Hong was an Emperor Realm expert, so why was he still so hot-blooded and impulsive?

Zhang Ruoxi smiled slightly. “Sister, you don’t need to worry about my master. Someone like Zu Hong could never be his match.”

“Master?” Lu Wen looked at Zhang Ruoxi in surprise. “Aren’t you a disciple of the Shrine?”

Zhang Ruoxi shook her head. “I’m just someone from a small family. My master took me in and taught me cultivation, which is how I achieved what I have today.”

“Ah!” Lu Wen exclaimed in shock.

She could sense that Zhang Ruoxi’s cultivation was higher than her own. She herself was at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, so if Zhang Ruoxi was stronger, that meant she was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. But for such a powerful expert to have been taught by Senior Brother Yang? That was no different from the Elite Disciples of the great Sects.

“What cultivation does Senior Brother Yang have?” Lu Wen asked in astonishment.

Zhang Ruoxi pursed her lips in a proud, honored smile. “My master is already an Emperor.”

Lu Wen was completely stunned. The gloom in her eyes that had lingered for so long was swept away, replaced by a bright light. The darkness and anxiety before her vanished.

…

Outside Qingyang Pavilion, at the teahouse, Lord Jia’s hawk-like eyes were fixed on the entrance of Qingyang Pavilion, unconsciously raising his teacup to his lips.

He didn’t know the origins of the man and woman who had entered Qingyang Pavilion earlier. Even after sending his subordinates to investigate, he couldn’t find anything out. It seemed they had only arrived in the city today. This made Lord Jia wary, afraid that the pair really were connected to the matter the City Lord had instructed him about.

He didn’t dare miss a single detail, his entire mind focused on Qingyang Pavilion.

Suddenly, a deep sense of unease rose in his heart, as if some danger was approaching, making his heart pound wildly.

Before Lord Jia could react, he caught a glimpse out of the corner of his eye—someone had appeared out of nowhere.

He quickly turned his head, eyes wide, and saw that same young man sitting across from him, smiling cheerfully.

“Pfft…” Lord Jia couldn’t help it—a mouthful of tea sprayed straight at Yang Kai.

With a casual wave, Yang Kai redirected the tea mist, sending it right back onto Lord Jia’s own face and head.

Lord Jia scrambled to his feet, wiping his face in a panic, staring at Yang Kai with extreme vigilance and shock.

With his cultivation, he hadn’t even noticed how this young man appeared before him. If the other party had wanted to harm him, wouldn’t he have been killed in an instant?

At this thought, cold sweat broke out all over Lord Jia.

“Sit,” Yang Kai said with a smile, but his eyes were like a venomous snake, making Lord Jia shiver.

The latter hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and sat back down, his expression pained as if he were sitting on a bed of needles.

“What’s your name?” Yang Kai asked.

“Jia Si!”

“A pleasure, a pleasure,” Yang Kai replied perfunctorily, his eyes suddenly flashing cold. “Lord Jia, you should know why I’ve come to find you, right?”

Jia Si wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and forced a smile. “Young Master, you must be joking. I’m just here enjoying tea and wine, at ease. I don’t know why Young Master…”

He suddenly stopped, his gaze fixed on the palm-sized shield Secret Treasure in Yang Kai’s hand, exclaiming, “That shield…”

Jia Si’s eyesight was sharp. He immediately saw that the shield in Yang Kai’s hand was of high grade—apparently a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure, extremely valuable.

Even though he was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he couldn’t help but breathe a little faster.

Crackle…

Yang Kai squeezed, and the shield crumbled like a rock eroded by millennia of wind and rain, turning to powder and scattering to the ground.

“What shield?” Yang Kai looked at him coldly. “We’re talking, why bring up a shield?”

Jia Si was drenched in sweat, trembling all over, and stammered, “It’s nothing, nothing.”

Yang Kai snorted. “Lord Jia seems like a smart man. This conversation shouldn’t be too tiring. I have a few questions I’d like you to answer.”

Jia Si hurriedly said, “Young Master, please ask whatever you wish. I may not be much, but I’ve lived in Kunyuan City for many years and know it inside out.”

“Very good!” Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction, his gaze turning cold. “Who ordered you to monitor Qingyang Pavilion?”

Jia Si answered with difficulty, “It was… the City Lord!”

“Why did Zu Hong have you monitor Qingyang Pavilion?”

Jia Si said, “The City Lord only said that if anyone suspicious entered or left Qingyang Pavilion, I was to arrest them immediately and never let them leave Kunyuan City.”

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and snorted, “The City Lord certainly throws his weight around.”

Jia Si turned pale with fright and quickly said, “I’m only following orders, Young Master, please don’t be angry.”

Yang Kai asked, “Do you know which faction Qingyang Pavilion belongs to?”

Jia Si replied, “I didn’t know before, but a few days ago the City Lord had me investigate Qingyang Pavilion’s background, and I found out it’s a shop opened here by disciples of Qingyang Shrine from the Southern Territory.”

“You even found that out—impressive, Lord Jia,” Yang Kai sneered sarcastically.

Jia Si trembled even more, his face drawn. “I was just following orders…”

Yang Kai cut him off, his voice cold. “Have you seen a woman like this in the City Lord’s mansion?”

As he spoke, Yang Kai raised his hand, Emperor Yuan surging within him, and conjured an image of Gao Xueting before Jia Si.

Jia Si glanced at it and shook his head blankly. “I haven’t seen her, but I heard from my subordinates that she used to come and go from Qingyang Pavilion quite often. It was by following her trail that I discovered the truth about Qingyang Pavilion.”

Yang Kai frowned. “You haven’t seen her?”

According to his and Lu Wen’s guess, Gao Xueting should have sought out Zu Hong to join forces and unravel the secret of the beast hide. Logically, she should have visited the City Lord’s mansion, and since Jia Si was Zu Hong’s trusted aide, there was no reason he wouldn’t have seen her.

But judging by Jia Si’s expression, he wasn’t lying.

Could it be that Gao Xueting really never sought out Zu Hong? Then who was she planning to join forces with?

Does the City Lord’s mansion have anything to do with this at all? If not for Gao Xueting, why would they be monitoring and surrounding Qingyang Pavilion?

Yang Kai was left completely puzzled.
