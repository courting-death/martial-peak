## Chapter 1233 — Journeying Together

A hundred li from that valley lay a desolate, secluded spot.

The four halted — Wei Guchang and Yang Kai among them. Emerging from the valley, Wei Guchang kept his Divine Sense sweeping the surroundings, ever on guard. They had already traveled over a hundred li without any ill‑intentioned folk coming to trouble them, which at last allowed him to breathe a little easier.

From start to finish, Xuan'er, Daiyuan and Yang Kai had not spoken a single word, silently pressing onward.

Only when they reached this spot did Wei Guchang finally stop. Touching his Spatial Ring, he turned back and asked, “Brother Yang, what are your plans from here on?”

He did not ask Daiyuan, but Yang Kai — Yang immediately understood. Wei likely suspected he had also obtained a portion of Red Candle Fruit flesh; since the two found themselves in the same circumstance, that was why he asked.

Yang Kai naturally would not give anything away in speech. Although he did rather like Wei Guchang, matters concerning the Red Candle Fruit were grave; better to be cautious.

He pondered a moment, then said, "Nothing special — I'm planning to push further into the Third Stage and see whether I can find anything of value."

Wei Guchang's expression shifted; he was greatly puzzled. By all logic, if Yang Kai truly had that last fragment of Red Candle Fruit flesh, he should be prudent and not risk plunging deeper, yet Yang actually intended to continue exploring.

Not only Wei Guchang, but even Dong Xuan’er and Daiyuan both showed equally puzzled expressions.

Yang Kai read their faces and remained impassive. "No one has ever entered the Third Layer's Heat‑Flame Zone," he said. "Even a heaven‑defying spirit fruit like the Red Candle Fruit appeared — perhaps there are even better things deeper within."

Hearing him, most of Wei Guchang's doubts were dispelled. He thought perhaps Yang truly had not acquired any Red Candle Fruit flesh, hence the brazen bearing. Wei nodded slightly. "If Brother Yang decides so, I will say no more. Only be cautious and may fortune favor you. Return laden with spoils! Xuan'er and I will not linger here — we will depart the Flowing Flame Sandland soon."

Wei Guchang’s decision did not surprise Yang Kai in the least. The Red Candle Fruit involved too many interests — anyone carrying such a spirit fruit would feel uneasy every moment. Wei Guchang clearly wished to leave as soon as possible and deliver his portion of the Red Candle Fruit flesh to the elders of Yingyue Hall. Not only him — Yang Kai guessed that Fang Tianzhong, Qu Changfeng, Yin Sudie, and even that rugged-looking burly man would think and act the same way. Moreover, none of them would entrust such a matter to others; they would personally carry their share of the Red Candle Fruit and leave the Flowing Flame Sandland themselves.

For Yang Kai this was welcome news: with so many sect elites withdrawing, fewer would remain — and with fewer people the competition would lessen.

"Yes, Brother Wei and Miss Xuan'er, travel safely," Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Wei Guchang then turned his gaze to Daiyuan and asked, "Daiyuan, what about you?"

"Me?" Daiyuan smiled. "I came in without finding anything good either, so I'm not in a hurry to leave. I'll stay and see if luck visits in the coming days."

"If so, then take care," Wei said — he naturally would not persuade Daiyuan to accompany him.

Dong Xuan’er stepped forward and spoke a few more words with Daiyuan, then she and Wei Guchang took their leave together, hastily retracing their path back the way they came.

Once the Flowing Flame Sandland opened, leaving was not impossible; previously no one bothered. After all, even the weaker could hunt Fire Spirit Beasts in the First Layer's Heat‑Flame Zone for Fire Crystal Stones.

Yet this time the appearance of the Red Candle Fruit caused the most powerful sects on the Dark Star to pull their elites out early — an occurrence nearly unheard of in ten thousand years.

Only after Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan’er’s figures disappeared from sight did Daiyuan quietly turn to study Yang Kai.

Like Wei, she had suspected Yang of obtaining Red Candle Fruit flesh, but now that Yang chose to remain and press deeper, she could no longer be certain of her guess.

As she pondered, Yang Kai suddenly turned to her and said, "Since matters here are settled, I will take my leave. I hope Miss Daiyuan finds good fortune in the days ahead."

"Wait!" Daiyuan cried out in alarm; she had never expected Yang Kai to part so readily.

"What is it?" Yang Kai bore her no ill will. Though born with a deficiency, she possessed a refined heart, and Yang Kai had formed a favorable impression of her during their time together. He could not fathom why she called after him when he had already made himself clear.

Daiyuan bit her lip, hesitated, then said, "Junior Brother Yang, I would like to go deeper too. May I accompany you on your journey?"

"With me?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

Though he did not know Daiyuan well, from their first meeting Yang Kai felt she preferred solitude — perhaps because of her bearing — so he had never expected her to request to travel alongside him.

This placed Yang Kai in a dilemma.

He intended to delve deeper into the Third Layer to find a suitable place to refine the Profound Yin Moon Water, but if he were to travel together with Daiyuan, it would inevitably interfere with his plans.

Seeing Yang Kai's frown, Daiyuan looked embarrassed, realizing her suggestion had troubled him. For certain reasons, however, she did not want to miss the chance to be alone with him.

Besides, she truly wished to explore the Third Layer; it differed greatly from the Second and First Layers, and Daiyuan did not trust she could safely go alone. If she accompanied Yang Kai, she would at least have someone to watch her back in danger.

So despite her embarrassment, Daiyuan kept a pleading look in her eyes, silently praying he would not be heartless and refuse.

She couldn't recall how long it had been since she'd felt so anxious and needy. For a long time she had stopped asking anything of others and resolved to rely only on herself, yet now she had broken that resolve.

After a while Yang Kai relaxed his brow and grinned, "All right."

Daiyuan's face brightened at his words, gratitude shining in her eyes.

“However, there’s something that must be made clear,” Yang Kai said seriously. “You should already know what the situation in this Third Layer is like, Miss Daiyuan. If we encounter a restriction or danger that even I cannot handle, then the two of us will have to rely on ourselves. Should you fall in such a case, don’t blame me for not lending a hand.”

"Naturally," Daiyuan nodded lightly. "If faced with mortal peril, it can only be said my luck ran out."

"Mm." Pleased she agreed readily, Yang Kai added, "One more thing — I have matters to attend to deep in the Third Layer. When I must handle that matter, I will have to separate from you. I cannot stay with you until the Flowing Flame Sandland closes."

Daiyuan showed mild surprise, but quickly understood and smiled, "Junior Brother Yang intends to use this place's environment to cultivate some secret art?"

She assumed so; the environment here could not be found outside, and whatever Yang needed to do would naturally be tied to cultivation.

"Something like that," Yang Kai neither confirmed nor denied. "If you have no objection to these conditions, then we can travel together."

"Of course I have no objection," Daiyuan replied readily. Yang's two conditions were no demands she could refuse.

"Then in the days ahead I'll be in your care, Miss Daiyuan," Yang Kai grinned.

"It is Daiyuan who will trouble Junior Brother Yang."

After deciding, Yang Kai produced the Yuan Magnetic Pointer, checked the direction, and the two pressed deeper into the Third Layer.

The Third Layer's Heat‑Flame might was fierce; Yang Kai had to constantly employ his Saint Yuan to resist the fire toxin, while Daiyuan was simpler — beneath her clothes she seemed to wear a treasure armor. With a slight activation it emitted a pale blue halo, an icy breath flowing from it that kept the fire toxin at least three feet away.

As they traveled, Daiyuan felt secretly startled. From their first meeting she had known Yang Kai relied on his Saint Yuan to counter the fire toxin rather than wearing armor like other sect elites, yet her heart was still shaken.

She could not fathom the toll his reckless Saint Yuan expenditure must exact, but he betrayed no sign of fatigue.

Daiyuan wondered how vast Yang Kai's Saint Yuan reserves must be to allow such lavish waste.

After a day's travel Yang Kai suggested they sit to recover, which relieved Daiyuan considerably.

It would be strange if such use of Saint Yuan required no recovery. Even with her armor's activation she had expended much strength; had Yang not proposed it, she would have asked to rest herself.

They found a secluded spot and each took a place to meditate.

Yang Kai had no need for recovery; the Saint Yuan he used to resist the fire toxin was a mere trifle to him. He only sought a chance to deal with the Red Candle Fruit flesh he'd obtained.

Though in the valley he had hastily fashioned a spirit‑wood box to store the Red Candle Fruit flesh, the job had been rushed and the vessel crude — unable to fully guarantee the medicine's potency — so he took this opportunity to reprocess it.

Two hours later Yang Kai had finished arranging it and, satisfied, tossed the Red Candle Fruit flesh into the Black Book Space, then leisurely rose and walked toward Daiyuan's meditation spot.
