## Chapter 121 — Fellow Sect Senior Sister

“Old man running wild?” Meng Wuya laughed as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world, his mouth unable to close. Then his expression turned cold as he snapped, “So what if I am running wild?”

With that, he casually swung out a palm strike.

“Get out of the way!” Hu Man’s face changed instantly. He was about to pull Long Jun behind him, but Meng Wuya’s strike came like lightning. Before Hu Man could even raise his hand, a crisp smack echoed across Long Jun’s face.

Two teeth flew out with the sound. Long Jun’s body spun several times in midair before he crashed to the ground with a thud.

The Blood Battle Gang members were instantly horrified, and Hu Man felt a chill run down his spine.

None of them had seen clearly how the old man in the sky had struck. From over fifty zhang away, a single palm strike landed without giving anyone the slightest chance to react.

Was this truly the work of a Divine Roaming Realm cultivator? Even at the peak, such overwhelming power should not have left everyone so helpless.

Hu Man thought that if it were the Lingxiao Pavilion’s sect leader delivering that palm, he would have a ninety percent chance of blocking it.

Why was there such a vast difference between cultivators of the same Divine Roaming Realm peak?

Long Jun was stunned by the palm strike. After falling, he staggered to his feet, spinning several times to regain his bearings. When he looked at Meng Wuya again, his face was full of fear and dread.

His right cheek was swollen high. Though there was no internal injury, the saying went: “When insulting, do not reveal flaws; when hitting, do not strike the face.” To be slapped publicly by Meng Wuya was a humiliation he could not express to others.

“So what if I am running wild? What will you do about it?” Meng Wuya waited leisurely until Long Jun stood firm, then swung out another palm.

“Smack!” Just like before, Long Jun was sent flying again. The many experts of the Blood Battle Gang did not even have time to react.

“Damn it! How dare he say I’m running wild? What nonsense!” Meng Wuya cursed, shaking his hand as if flicking away a pile of filth, his face twisted in disgust.

Hu Man could no longer hold back. He shouted angrily, “Senior, you are a high-level cultivator. How can you strike a junior like this? Aren’t you afraid of being ridiculed?”

“Hmph! If I truly wanted to strike, would he still be alive? This is but a small lesson,” Meng Wuya sneered coldly. Then he barked, “Come here!”

With a wave of his hand, Long Jun, who had yet to rise, was sucked up by a powerful force. Suspended midair, Long Jun clawed wildly, his face full of panic as he shouted, “Gang Leader, save me!”

“Senior!” Hu Man stepped forward, shouting sharply.

Meng Wuya ignored him completely, gripping Long Jun by the neck with a grim expression. “Every debt has its debtor. I came today only for Long Zaitian! Since you are Long Zaitian’s grandson, you’d better tell me where he is!”

After two slaps, Long Jun had become more docile than a rabbit. No longer brash, he gritted his teeth through the pain on both cheeks and trembled as he said, “Grandfather is not in the gang.”

“Where is he?”

“In the mining area!”

“Show me the way!”

Under the threat of death, Long Jun dared not hesitate. Meng Wuya asked, and he answered promptly. Despite his swollen cheeks, his words were surprisingly clear.

Meng Wuya’s figure flickered, and in an instant, he was over a hundred zhang away, heading straight for the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area with Long Jun in tow.

“Gang Leader!” A group of people looked anxiously at Hu Man, waiting for his decision.

“Follow them,” Hu Man said, his anger burning. He truly did not understand how Long Zaitian had provoked such a high-level cultivator, nor had the other party explained.

Hu Man’s fury was twofold: first, at Meng Wuya’s unreasonable bullying; second, at Long Zaitian’s recklessness in offending such a powerful figure and bringing trouble to the gang.

He had seen the Long family’s recent schemes. Though the Long family had long been the Blood Battle Gang’s mainstay, Hu Man had wanted to cut off this poison. Yet he dared not act, for attacking the Long family would surely cause the gang to fracture and weaken significantly.

If only Hu Man had a son, he could have trained him to contend with the Long family’s young talents, preventing this chaos.

Now that Long Zaitian had provoked such a formidable expert, Hu Man saw a chance. If he could use this opportunity to strip the Long family of their power within the gang, it would be a blessing in disguise.

No matter what, Hu Man resolved to follow and see for himself.

Meanwhile, the Black Wind Trade Market remained bustling.

Yang Kai carried twenty thousand taels of silver notes and walked through the market. He first spent ten thousand taels on some Yang Flame Stones, keeping some money in reserve. Then he found an empty spot, sat cross-legged, picked up a discarded signboard, wiped off the old characters, and casually wrote a few words:

“Purchasing seeds of Yang-attribute Spirit Herbs and Spirit Fruits!”

He stuck the sign in front of him and ignored it, quietly circulating the True Yang Technique, secretly absorbing the energy from the Yang Flame Stones he had tucked away.

Last time, Li Yuntian had helped Yang Kai collect seeds but to no avail, showing how rare such seeds were.

Yang Kai was merely trying his luck. Absorbing the energy from the Yang Flame Stones took time, so practicing cultivation while buying seeds was efficient.

After half a day, he finally absorbed all the energy from the twenty Yang Flame Stones.

Each stone could condense two drops of Yang Liquid, so twenty stones yielded forty drops. His dantian was once again full, and upon checking, Yang Kai was quite satisfied.

If another battle of that previous night’s scale occurred, he could now give his all.

However, after half a day, no one had come to sell seeds.

Standing up, Yang Kai glanced toward the wooden hut where the Lingxiao Pavilion’s guarding disciples stayed. Su Yan should be inside.

He had wanted to greet her and tell her he had returned, but reconsidered. They were not close, and someone as cold and noble as her was not someone he wished to approach.

There was no point in facing another cold stare.

Just as he was about to leave, a young woman suddenly approached and crouched down to look at Yang Kai’s sign. Then she looked up and said, “You want to buy seeds?”

Yang Kai looked down and saw a young woman, probably seventeen or eighteen years old, dressed in Lingxiao Pavilion robes. She was of above-average beauty, with delicate features, clear eyes like water, smooth skin, and a shapely figure. Especially notable were her ample breasts, so impressive it was hard to imagine what she had eaten to grow such assets. Crouching like that, Yang Kai’s gaze inadvertently fell on the smooth white hollow between her chest.

“Mm.” He subtly averted his eyes and nodded.

The woman stood and said, “I have some, but I don’t know if you can afford my price.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai’s interest was piqued. “Let me see what seeds you have.”

She was a fellow sect disciple, so Yang Kai naturally felt some warmth.

“I’ll show you.” She untied a delicate pouch from her waist and handed it to Yang Kai.

He took it, opened it, and poured out two seeds.

These seeds indeed contained Yang attribute energy, exactly what he needed. Moreover, these seeds seemed of higher quality than the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower seeds he had bought before.

If the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower seeds were Earth-Grade Lower-Level, these must be Earth-Grade Middle or Upper-Level.

“I’ll take these two. What’s your price?” Yang Kai was pleased.

The woman smiled sweetly and said, “One thousand taels!”

Yang Kai frowned. Though her smile was lovely and enhanced her beauty, the price was too steep.

In truth, spending a thousand taels on these seeds was not a loss for Yang Kai, as he had Yang Liquid to accelerate their growth, greatly shortening their maturation. But for others, paying a thousand taels would be a losing deal.

This woman was asking for an exorbitant price, which quickly dispelled Yang Kai’s initial fondness.

“Senior Sister, isn’t your price a bit high?” Yang Kai still had ten thousand taels left, but that was reserved for buying Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs, not to be spent frivolously.

“High?” The woman pursed her lips and smiled. “Not at all. These are Earth-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Herb seeds of Chizi Xin. Once matured, they have many uses. To those who know their worth, they’re worth far more than a thousand taels.”

Yang Kai smiled wryly. “You’ll have to wait for them to mature. How many years will that take?”

The woman pouted. “If you want seeds, you must be patient. Do you expect to plant them and harvest immediately? There’s no such good fortune in the world. Besides, rarity makes them precious. Seeds are scarce, and a thousand taels is a thousand taels. I suffered a lot to get these.”

Yang Kai sighed, thought carefully, and nodded. “Fine, it’s a deal.”

He was sure he would profit from buying them, and judging by her tone, she had indeed gone through much trouble to obtain these seeds. She deserved some reward.

Besides, she was a fellow sect senior sister. Moreover, Yang Kai was not good at bargaining and wished to avoid wasting words. Letting her have a little advantage was no great harm.

He counted out a thousand taels and handed it over. The woman took it with a bright smile, carefully pocketed it, then looked at Yang Kai and said, “You’re a decent junior brother. This pouch is a gift from me, embroidered by myself.”

With that, she left happily.

Yang Kai was stunned. So this senior sister knew they were fellow disciples. If she had known and still asked such a high price, others would have lost the deal.

Being taken advantage of did not anger Yang Kai. It was just business. Next time, he would be more cautious.

After waiting a while longer with no one else selling seeds, Yang Kai packed up and prepared to use the remaining money to buy Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs.

Just a few steps away, the ground suddenly trembled violently, then shook again repeatedly. The disciples of the three factions in the Black Wind Trade Market instantly fell into chaos.

No one knew what had happened, only that the earth seemed about to split open. Many panicked and ran in all directions.
