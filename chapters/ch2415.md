## Chapter 2415 — Changsun Ying

"Winter Pearl? What is the Winter Pearl!" Zi Yu stared at Yang Kai in shock. From Yang Kai's tone and expression, it was clear he recognized this pearl and even knew exactly what it did. Moreover, the fiery red pearl in his hand must be deeply connected to this Winter Pearl, or else it wouldn't resonate so strongly.

"I'll explain it to you later!" Yang Kai swallowed hard, the overwhelming joy nearly making him lose control. He had no inclination to explain it to Zi Yu right now.

He never imagined he would encounter the Winter Pearl in the forbidden grounds of Ice Heart Valley!

Back in the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai had obtained three pearls: the Spring Pearl, the Summer Pearl, and the Autumn Pearl. Each pearl contained a distinct energy attribute. Yang Kai had always suspected there should be an ice-attributed Winter Pearl to complete the powers of the four seasons and manifest the cycle of time. Unfortunately, he hadn't seen the Winter Pearl back then, nor did he know where to find it, so he had set the matter aside.

He had kept the three pearls—the Spring, Summer, and Autumn Pearls—in his Spatial Ring all this time, never finding a use for them.

But today, here, he actually encountered the missing Winter Pearl! It was truly an unexpected fortune. He had only come here at Bing Yun's request, wanting to see which disciple was contacting her through the Secret Treasure, never expecting such a surprise.

The joy in the depths of his heart was beyond measure.

With the Winter Pearl here, he now had all four—the Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter—and could manifest the combined power of the cycle of time. He wondered what benefits this might bring him.

But how could the forbidden grounds of Ice Heart Valley contain the Winter Pearl? Yang Kai pondered over and over. He could only guess that Bing Yun, back when she was in the Dao Origin Realm, had also visited the Four Seasons Land. Perhaps she obtained the Winter Pearl there and brought it to the Northern Territory, leaving it in Ice Heart Valley after founding the sect and using its power to create the icy lake forbidden ground.

If that was the case, wouldn't taking the Winter Pearl away destroy the forbidden ground?

At this thought, Yang Kai hesitated. He felt that if he spoke honestly with Bing Yun, she probably wouldn't begrudge him the Winter Pearl. Leaving it here only provided a forbidden ground for Ice Heart Valley disciples to train in, but in his hands, he might glimpse the inheritance of the Great Emperor of Time!

That was the lifelong effort and martial foundation of a Great Emperor, far more precious than any forbidden ground.

Just as Yang Kai was wavering, unsure whether to take the Winter Pearl now, it suddenly shot out a pure white beam of light straight into the sky.

"Not good!" Zi Yu's face changed. She called out, "Senior Brother Yang, quickly put it away!"

Yang Kai realized something was wrong too. The Winter Pearl seemed to have been refined by Bing Yun, so it could unleash some power, unlike the other three pearls in his possession, which were useless. Now that it suddenly erupted with a beam of light, it was clearly influenced by the Summer Pearl.

With this beam of light, the entire Ice Heart Valley would surely be alerted. This was the forbidden ground, and it wouldn't be long before the valley's experts came to investigate.

So before Zi Yu finished speaking, he hurriedly stuffed the Summer Pearl into his Spatial Ring and reached out to grab the Winter Pearl.

Since he was already exposed, there was no need to hesitate. He might as well snatch the pearl now and explain to Bing Yun later in Binglun City, asking her to give him the Winter Pearl.

He reached out with a large hand, but the omnipresent chill instantly froze his skin a deep purplish-black. Frost crept across the back of his hand, and in that moment, Yang Kai felt as if all sensation had vanished from his fingers. Alarmed, he hurriedly circulated his Origin Qi to resist the biting cold.

After much effort, he finally grabbed the Winter Pearl and quickly tossed it into his Spatial Ring, feeling much better afterward.

The next moment, he pulled the stunned Zi Yu and said in a low voice, "Go!"

Zi Yu, still dazed, said, "Senior Brother Yang, why are you stealing our Ice Heart Valley's treasure?"

She still hadn't figured out what was happening. If Yang Kai hadn't shown the ancestor's token and stated his purpose, Zi Yu might have attacked him by now.

To snatch the forbidden ground's treasure right in front of an elite disciple of Ice Heart Valley—this was nothing short of robbery!

"Senior Bing Yun instructed me to take this pearl away. She has other plans for it!" Yang Kai couldn't explain clearly and could only make up an excuse.

"Oh." Zi Yu believed him and didn't ask further.

Yang Kai dragged Zi Yu with one hand and held Bing Yun's token with the other, quickly breaking through the forbidden ground's barrier and rushing out.

At this moment, the entire Ice Heart Valley was in an uproar. Countless disciples, disturbed by the commotion in the forbidden ground, rushed out of their houses—some stood in a daze, others hurried toward the forbidden ground to investigate.

Waves of strong and weak auras surged throughout Ice Heart Valley, making Yang Kai secretly anxious.

Ice Heart Valley truly deserved its reputation as one of the top sects in the Northern Territory. Even without Bing Yun presiding, there were plenty of experts in the valley. There were more than a dozen First and Second Stage Emperor Realm experts, a force not inferior to Qingyang Shrine in the Southern Territory. This showed just how deep Ice Heart Valley's foundation was, only lacking someone to rival Wen Zishan.

Yet even such a sect couldn't withstand the pressure from Wenqing Sect and had to prepare to marry off its best disciple to Feng Xi. In comparison, Wenqing Sect's overall strength was definitely greater than Ice Heart Valley's.

The valley was in chaos, which made it easier for Yang Kai to escape with Zi Yu. He carefully avoided the Emperor Realm experts and managed to pass unnoticed.

Zi Yu felt an unprecedented tension. Last time, when her master helped her escape Ice Heart Valley, it wasn't nearly this thrilling. Back then, she only wanted to leave the Northern Territory and never be found by Wenqing Sect. But now, a man was fleeing with her—it felt as if she was eloping with Senior Brother Yang Kai.

If someone caught them now, not even the waters of all five lakes and four seas could wash away the scandal. Nervous, Zi Yu's heart pounded wildly.

"Who's sneaking around!" Suddenly, a sharp voice called out nearby, followed by a flash of light. Unmatched sword intent descended from above, enveloping her and Yang Kai.

Zi Yu's face changed dramatically, realizing her emotional turmoil had exposed their whereabouts. She was filled with guilt.

At that moment, she felt a gentle force push her aside, out of the range of the sword intent. Immediately after, Yang Kai drew his sword like a cloud and fiercely clashed with the newcomer.

A series of crisp clangs rang out. The newcomer let out a soft "hmm," seemingly surprised, then gracefully retreated without attempting to kill.

Yang Kai took the opportunity to catch his breath, his face pale. With a shake, he forced away the icy sword intent enveloping him.

He secretly rejoiced that the newcomer was only a First Stage Emperor Realm expert. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to resist. He had fought many such experts recently, gaining valuable experience, so even though he suffered a bit, it was nothing serious.

"Yu'er!" The newcomer frowned and called out to Zi Yu, "Why are you here?"

Hearing this, Yang Kai relaxed. Since this person addressed Zi Yu so affectionately, she must be an elder who cared deeply for her. If she liked Zi Yu, she probably wouldn't make things difficult for her.

Only now did Yang Kai have a chance to get a good look at the newcomer. She was a woman dressed as a young matron, petite and delicate, wielding twin cherry blossom swords. Her features were charming, her clothes tightly wrapped around her curvaceous figure, making her extremely pleasing to the eye. Her petite frame made her appearance almost girlish.

But any martial artist who reached the Emperor Realm couldn't be judged by appearance. This woman was at least several thousand years old.

"Seventh Senior Aunt!" Zi Yu called out softly, her face full of pleading.

"You actually escaped the forbidden ground—was it him who saved you?" The woman Zi Yu called Seventh Senior Aunt looked thoughtfully at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes scrutinizing him as if trying to see into his soul.

Her eyes were clear and flawless, spotless. Meeting her gaze, Yang Kai felt as if all the darkness and evil hidden in his heart could be washed away. He realized this woman must have cultivated some profound secret art.

"Yes, this is Senior Brother Yang Kai!" Zi Yu quickly nodded and introduced, "Senior Brother Yang, this is my Seventh Senior Aunt, Changsun Ying. She treats me very well."

She deliberately added the last sentence, clearly afraid Yang Kai might fall out with her Seventh Senior Aunt.

"So it's Senior Changsun. Yang Kai greets Senior!" Yang Kai quickly cupped his fists.

Changsun Ying snorted, "No wonder you always refused this marriage. So you already have someone in mind."

Changsun Ying thought simply: if Yang Kai and Zi Yu weren't in love, why would this man risk so much to rescue her from Ice Heart Valley? A man willing to go to such lengths for a woman could only be explained by love. Only love could make a man give so much for a woman.

Zi Yu blushed and waved her hand, "Seventh Senior Aunt, you've misunderstood. Senior Brother Yang was sent by the ancestor."

Changsun Ying's body trembled, but she quickly calmed down and sighed, "Don't lie to me. Master hasn't been heard from in three thousand years... Go, I didn't see you."
