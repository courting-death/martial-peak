## Chapter 2072 — Demonic Qi Rampage

The Jiang Family members' faces turned ashen; they looked at Yang Kai, who approached like a grim reaper, his whole body shrouded in cold.

Everyone suddenly realized that one wrong choice had left them trapped by Yang Kai like turtles in a jar.

"Very good, very good, all of you are blocked here—saves me the trouble of chasing you down one by one." Yang Kai stopped not far from the Jiang Family, looking at them at leisure with a half-smile, and said, "Your old ancestor appears not to be a very loyal man."

At those words, Jiang Lin felt as if an invisible hammer had struck his chest; his face flushed crimson and he spat a mouthful of blood, then threw his head back and wailed, "I hate him..."

The other Jiang Family members all went ashen, their faces clouded with a tangled mix of shame and humiliation.

By now, everyone understood why the Space Array beneath their feet could not operate: it had everything to do with their old ancestor having destroyed the other space array on the opposite side.

The array inside the cave and the one in the mine pit were linked; only when both remained intact could they teleport between them.

But once Jiang Taisheng teleported away, the array here malfunctioned—obviously because of his actions over there.

It wasn’t hard to see his motive — he only sought to impede Yang Kai’s pursuit — yet by doing so he sacrificed the rest of the Jiang Family’s chance to flee.

As the clan's progenitor, at a moment of crisis he cared only for his own life and disregarded the lives of his kin—how could that not chill people to the bone?

In despair, Jiang Lin looked at Yang Kai listlessly and said, "Pillmaster Yang. Since matters have come to this, kill or carve me as you please—I'm entirely at your disposal!"

He still had some backbone; faced with doom he had no intention of begging for mercy but sought death instead—likely so heartbroken by his ancestor's deeds that he no longer wished to cling to life.

But although he thought that way, the others of the Jiang Family did not.

Hearing Jiang Lin, several elders' expressions flickered, and the rising young talent Jiang Chuhe was struck with alarm. He hurried forward with a fawning look and begged Yang Kai, "Pillmaster Yang, I, Jiang Chuhe, have been blind before and offended you. I beg Pillmaster Yang to be magnanimous and not hold it against me. I have now repented; in future I will amend my ways and follow Pillmaster Yang, to serve like a loyal hound!"

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, showing an amused look of interest.

"You wretched beast..." Qi and blood already assaulted Jiang Lin, leaving him weak and listless; Jiang Chuhe's provocation worsened his state and he nearly fainted. He forced himself upright, trembling as he jabbed Jiang Chuhe in the spine with a finger and said in grief and fury, "You coward who clings to life—how dare you call yourself of the Jiang Family!"

Jiang Chuhe whipped around, his voice harsh, "Old coot, shut your mouth! Even the ancestral elder has abandoned us—do you expect me to go seek my own death? I, Jiang Chuhe, am still young and have a bright future; I will not die here for no reason! If any of you still have sense, then quickly pledge yourselves to Pillmaster Yang. Pillmaster Yang is kind at heart; he might spare your lives."

"Well said!" Yang Kai smiled faintly, looking approvingly at Jiang Chuhe, "A man who knows the times is a hero—well done!"

Jiang Chuhe quickly turned, putting on an even more obsequious expression; he bowed slightly and smiled ingratiatingly, "Pillmaster Yang flatters me."

"But I dislike those who are greedy for life and afraid of death!" Yang Kai's face suddenly went cold.

Jiang Chuhe's smile froze stiff on his face.

"Enough, no more nonsense. I had not intended to wipe out the Jiang Family entirely—only to punish the ringleader—but since this blood feud has been sown...then—farewell on your journey!" As he spoke, Yang Kai's expression grew cruel and murderous intent swelled like a tide; he slowly stretched out a hand and pushed it toward the Jiang Family.

The group of Void King Realm cultivators from the Jiang Family changed color and instinctively sought to resist, but they were horrified to find the surrounding space had somehow congealed; no matter how they struggled they could not move an inch. Worse, their internal strength stagnated in their meridians and could not be stirred.

The Power of the Laws!

The Jiang Family members went ashen in an instant and watched Yang Kai's palm push forward as the breath of death swept toward them.

And at that moment, an anomalous change erupted!

The earth suddenly hummed without warning and began to tremble violently. In scarcely a breath, cracking, clattering sounds rang out from every direction—ear-splitting, as if the end of the world were at hand.

Yang Kai's face changed; he released his Divine Sense, and upon discerning the surrounding changes he had no time to deal with the Jiang Family—he shifted and vanished from the cave, appearing beside Mo Xiaoqi in the next instant.

Xiaoqi had already retracted her demonic beast and floated in midair with a grave expression.

Seeing Yang Kai, she hurriedly said, "Eldest Brother Yang, it seems like that—"

"I know, run!" Yang Kai cut her off, urged his Origin Qi to wrap around her, and they fled rapidly into the distance.

Meanwhile, in the cave the Jiang Family members who had narrowly escaped death were left stunned and suspicious.

Someone shouted that something terrible was afoot, and they all scrambled out of the cave.

Once outside, the Jiang Family members gaped in astonishment.

Before them the land for a thousand li heaved like storm-tossed waves, violently rising and falling as if something stirred and gnawed beneath the earth. With each convulsion, jagged, interlocking fissures ripped open across the plain—crisscrossing in chaotic profusion, countless and extending into the distance beyond reckoning.

From those fissures, waves of pitch-black qi spread forth.

Those currents quickly formed into things like pitch-black spirit serpents that slithered about.

The world was soon filled with these entities.

In a moment of distraction, the Jiang Family members found themselves encircled, the black qi enclosing them so tightly that no air could pass.

"What is this?" an elder of the Jiang Family cried in terror. From the black qi he sensed an unsettling essence that seemed capable of stirring the deepest negative emotions within him; instantly his eyes turned blood-red and his breathing grew rapid.

"Demonic Qi!"

"Not good!"

"Run!"

The Jiang Family shouted and frantically urged their power to flee, but it was too late; the pitch-black, serpent-like presences surged like living things from all sides and instantly enveloped them.

The Origin Qi shields of many Jiang Family warriors could not prevent the black Qi's corrosion; before long their protections were eaten through, and the black Qi entered their bodies through their mouths, noses, eyes, and ears.

Soon screams rose one after another as the Jiang Family endured unimaginable torment and pain.

But after a short while, those cries abruptly ceased.

In the world shrouded by black Qi, one by one Jiang Family cultivators straightened and stood, but their aura was different now; each was wrapped in a black mist, wearing an indescribable wicked grin, and their eyeballs had turned black tinged with crimson—horrifying to behold.

Boom, boom, boom...

At one spot the earth was suddenly blasted open by a violent force, soil flying; a vigorous figure burst from the hole.

The figure landed, moved his limbs slightly, and his body emitted crisp crackling sounds. He twisted his neck and suddenly let out a low, sinister chuckle.

If Yang Kai had still been there, he would have recognized that figure: it was none other than the Jiang Family's old ancestor, Jiang Taisheng, whom he had earlier beaten until he fled like a mangy dog.

But in that brief span, Jiang Taisheng's injuries seemed to have healed; moreover his aura was far more powerful than before, as if he had been vastly enhanced.

Not only him—the other Jiang Family members were the same.

Every person who had been invaded by the black qi experienced great increases in their aura and strength.

Jiang Taisheng stood a moment, then a swishing sound came from behind him; one figure after another leapt out of the hole and lined up behind him, silent and extremely eerie.

Those figures were all the Jiang Family warriors and mine slaves who had been demonized earlier in the pit.

Jiang Taisheng surveyed the scene with a wholly satisfied expression, then raised his head and let out a long roar.

The howl carried straight to the heavens, and the pitch-black Demonic Qi, as if answering some summons, began to spiral and gather into a seething, ink-dark tornado that shot up into the sky, as though intending to gouge a hole through the firmament.

Far off, Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi, who were sprinting with all their might, heard the howl and both turned pale.

"This is bad!" Yang Kai exclaimed. "I don't know what the Jiang Family has unleashed this time—Fenglin City may be in mortal danger!"

"If I'm not mistaken, it's the Demonic Qi of an Ancient Great Demon!" Mo Xiaoqi added.

"Ancient Great Demon?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Yes. In ancient times humans, yao, demons, and other races each had their eras of prosperity and at times ruled the Star Realm. But with the passage of years and cycles of change, one race after another was replaced. Because our human race remained vast in number and possessed many strong experts, we have ruled the Star Realm to this day and suppressed the other races. That does not mean those races were exterminated; in some hidden corners of the Star Realm various other races still maintain places to breed and thrive, though they rarely show themselves. The present demon race is one such example, but it is in no way comparable to the Ancient Great Demons; only an Ancient Great Demon's pure Demonic Qi can demonize other living beings and convert them into members of the Demon Race!"
