## Chapter 1514 — Warship

In an instant, a thin membrane enveloped the warship; though it looked fragile, no matter how the ice beasts attacked, they could not tear through its defenses, yet under the countless bites the membrane's radiance was rapidly fading.

Even ants can gnaw an elephant to death; though the warship was of a high class, it could not withstand such a relentless onslaught forever — sooner or later it would be destroyed.

Just then, a dozen or so pillars of pure white light suddenly shot forth from a point on the warship and slammed toward a target.

With his heart tied to the warship's survival, Yang Kai dared not slacken for a moment, continuously directing his disciples to realign their attacks.

A dozen or so beams launched in unison; the sight was overwhelmingly grand.

In merely ten breaths, the second array node was destroyed.

After a little while more, the third array node collapsed as well!

The Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array that covered the inner city instantly ceased functioning; the ice beasts condensed from pure frigid qi dissolved into pinpricks of light and vanished.

The crisis was thus so easily averted!

Yet everyone had a palmful of sweat clutched in their hands.

A gale swept through, scattering the dense chill; without the three array nodes feeding cold energy, the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array was rendered useless, and the Battle Sky Alliance's inner city gradually cleared, exposed to the gaze of the Lingxiao Sect.

“Ha ha, that old dog Qu Zheng is probably foaming at the mouth with anger.” Fei Zhi Tu laughed long and loud — last time at the Fallen Emperor Mountains he had almost died, and although Yang Kai had revived him, his strength had dropped a Stage, leaving him to hate the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect to the bone.

Seeing even the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array unable to touch the Lingxiao Sect's warship naturally lifted his spirits.

Qu Zheng truly leapt about in fury.

He never expected the mighty array his faction prided itself on would be so bungled and undone, completely failing to play any role.

Up to now the enemy had not shown their faces, hiding inside the warship and using the Crystal Cannon to press a whole sect into helplessness.

Qu Zheng had never felt so powerless.

“Engage the enemy, at all costs — even if we fill the ground with our lives, destroy that warship!” Qu Zheng's roaring fury echoed to the ninth heaven.

Now that the arrays were shattered, the Battle Sky Alliance had no choice but to sortie in force and rely on human wave tactics.

If the Lingxiao Sect lost that warship, the Battle Sky Alliance could still turn the tide!

Orders were issued and countless cultivators surged from their hiding places, charging toward the warship with fierce momentum.

Unexpectedly, even as they rushed to within a hundred zhang of the warship, the black hull remained utterly still, allowing the Battle Sky Alliance's warriors to surround it.

The thick-packed heads numbered at least a few thousand. Each among those thousands had strength not below Saint Realm.

This already represented eighty percent of the Battle Sky Alliance's available force; the rest were too weak to be of use in such a fight.

The warship, besieged by these thousands, resembled a lost vessel in the boundless sea, directionless and without hope.

The Battle Sky Alliance's cultivators rubbed their hands and glared like hungry tigers.

Next moment, multicolored radiance suddenly blossomed from the hull; the once black warship seemed dyed in hues, brilliant and resplendent.

In an instant the prismatic light enveloped a radius of a thousand zhang, and a wondrous profound intent pressed into everyone's minds.

Immediately many of the weaker fighters froze, their Saint Yuan stuttering; they screamed and fell from the sky as if some force restrained their bodies and Saint Yuan.

Even those slightly stronger who could resist the bodily effect could not help but feel a panic seize their souls.

“Glazed Light! Impossible — this is Glazed Light!” a knowledgeable cultivator cried in horror.

As a native of Dark Star, these cultivators had naturally heard of Glazed Light.

But that art had always been the preserve of the Liuli Sect; in each generation only one or two ever cultivated the Glazed Light secret technique.

Now the Glazed Light was bursting from the Lingxiao Sect's warship as if the entire vessel were forged from Thousand Illusions Glaze, its Glazed Light power fully manifest!

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were dumbstruck, unable to fathom the truth of the matter.

“Yang Kai, is this truly Glazed Light?” Qian Tong asked with an odd expression.

It was no wonder he was incredulous: the Liuli Sect guarded Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain with extreme rigour and never allowed outsiders near; even their own inadequate disciples were barred from approach.

Where on earth did Yang Kai obtain Thousand Illusions Glaze?

And to cover the whole warship — how much Thousand Illusions Glaze would that take to craft?

“Mm, it’s indeed the Glazed Light,” Yang Kai nodded lightly, then grinned. “The ones who possess the Thousand Illusions Glaze aren’t limited to the Liuli Sect alone.”

“Uh…” Qian Tong fell silent; he wanted to believe Yang Kai, but as far as he knew, across Dark Star only the Liuli Sect had Thousand Illusions Glaze.

Who would be fooled by such an obvious cover story? The kid truly had fingers in the sky — no one knew when he had acquired the Thousand Illusions Glaze.

But rumor had it he visited the Liuli Sect years ago to greet Daiyuan — could it have been then?

Qian Tong dared not think further; if the Liuli Sect learned of this, they would surely not let it go.

As the two spoke, cries of agony kept coming from outside: those who fell hundreds of zhang from the sky could not withstand it; Saint King Realm fighters escaped death due to superior constitution, though they fell in a sorry state.

But those of Saint Realm were ill-fated.

One by one they shrieked and wailed, breaking arms and legs, while those with poor bodies were smashed to pulp, flesh and blood an appalling sight.

The number of cultivators around the warship instantly dropped by seventy percent.

It was not over — the Glazed Light made all souls tremble and minds uneasy. Then the warship's prow suddenly revealed a fist-sized Crystal Stone, around which an intricate and mysterious formation was arrayed, its lines glowing.

From the Crystal Stone ripples visible to the naked eye cascaded, and after passing through that strange formation they radiated outward.

When those ripples swept past, every Battle Sky Alliance cultivator was stunned.

For they found, absurdly, various illusions appearing before their eyes, as if plunged into some phantasm.

In an instant the Battle Sky Alliance's warriors were thrown into chaos; shouts of alarm rose in waves.

Yang Yan had poured her heart into forging this Void King-Grade warship, using countless rare materials.

Eight-tenths of the wealth and materials Yang Kai had amassed over the years were invested into this warship, which explained its grade and terrifying power.

The Thousand Illusions Glaze need not be explained — it was stolen from Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain by the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao when Yang Kai visited the Liuli Sect years ago to see Daiyuan.

The Liuli Sect's protections around Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain were indeed severe; ordinary people could not succeed in stealing it, and even if one approached the mountain, harvesting Thousand Illusions Glaze from the massif was impossible.

But Xiaoxiao was different.

Devouring minerals was its innate divine skill; where ordinary men could not excavate, even Void King Realm experts found Thousand Illusions Glaze a headache — to Xiaoxiao it was no different from a delicious meal.

The Liuli Sect's visit bore great merit for Xiaoxiao.

The fist-sized jade set into the warship's prow was in fact the Mirage Stone Yang Kai had brought back from the Sixth Layer of the Imperial Garden!

The Mirage Stone was exceedingly rare and already had hallucination-inducing effects; amplified by the illusion array arranged by Yang Yan, its power was unimaginably great.

Even those of Origin Returning Realm could not resist the Mirage Stone's might; in an instant all were swept into illusion.

“We may strike.” Inside the warship, Yang Kai sneered with a cruel, cold look.

At his words, the faces of those present trembled.

“Open the hatch!” Yang Kai barked.

A thunderous rumble followed as the warship's hatch opened. Yang Kai strode forth at the head; Ye Xijun, Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu followed close behind, and Chang Qi and the others were not to be outdone and joined in.

Stepping out of the warship, the scene before them left everyone incredulous.

Among the Battle Sky Alliance cultivators, regardless of strength, more than half stared vacantly, their expressions altered, trapped in illusion, while some were madly attacking enemies that did not exist.

A few remained composed, standing their ground and looking around cautiously, on guard.

But no one seemed able to perceive the doom about to descend.

“Kill!” Yang Kai flicked his hand, and accompanied by a clear cry like birdsong the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird answered, bursting into a scorching firelight that dove upon the nearest enemy and in an instant wrapped and burned him to death.

Ye Xijun and the others immediately scattered, manifesting Secret Treasures and unleashing Martial Skills, slaying the scarcely resisting foes at will.

Yang Kai strolled leisurely through the void, dozens of Golden Blood Threads weaving and drifting around him, moving as naturally as his own arms and fingers. They formed a cocoon of shimmering gold—anything that dared approach was instantly sliced to dust by the countless threads of light.

He showed no sign of direct action, yet where he passed Saint King Realm cultivators clutched their heads and wailed as if tormented, their souls extinguishing in a short time.

Tiny vermin invisible to the eye and even difficult for Divine Sense to detect pounced viciously upon those Saint King Realm cultivators, causing their inexplicable deaths.

Soul Devouring Worms!

With Yang Kai's power rising and his foes growing ever stronger, the Soul-Devouring worms long fostered in his Sea of Consciousness had little use in direct duels, but now for mass slaughter it proved the perfect choice.

Soul-Devouring worms feed on Divine Sense power; once a Sea of Consciousness is drained, the cultivator is certain to fall.

Yang Kai was like a god of slaughter descended from ancient times, cutting down every foe he encountered until none were left alive.

The numerous Battle Sky Alliance cultivators became live targets with no means of resistance; even Chang Qi and the others slaughtered with abandon.

In the palace, Qu Zheng and the others' faces were ashen and their bodies trembling violently.

They could not have imagined the Lingxiao Sect's warship could unleash such horrifying might, equipped with so many unimaginable means — their disciples were struck down like three-year-old children, utterly helpless.
