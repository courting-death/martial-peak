## Chapter 2479 — All Things Devoured

Yang Kai’s eyes widened in shock as he stared at him, his voice trembling: “You... what do you mean? Don’t tell me that lord isn't actually dead?”

Wu Mengchuan, knowing he had let something slip in his earlier agitation, simply glared coldly at Yang Kai, his face full of murderous intent.

A chill suddenly crept up from the soles of Yang Kai’s feet, making him shiver involuntarily.

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor—he was a legend, but that legend was supposedly slain in the Shattered Star Sea by the combined might of the other Emperors, his Divine Soul utterly destroyed. Yet now, Wu Mengchuan had let slip something unusual.

If anyone else had said this, Yang Kai might not have believed it, but Wu Mengchuan was the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s descendant. His words carried some weight.

If the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor wasn’t dead, then this was all far too insane.

After tens of thousands of years of dormancy and patience, just what had the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor been doing? And for what purpose?

Yang Kai gulped audibly.

“I once thought you were a promising talent, and this Lord was reluctant to kill you. But now, it seems you must die!” Wu Mengchuan growled, suddenly clenching his fist and punching toward Yang Kai. The force shattered barriers and crushed the void, its power boundless.

This urgent move to silence him only made Yang Kai more uneasy, unsure if his earlier guess was correct.

And after Wu Mengchuan struck, Yang Kai couldn’t help but be shocked.

This man’s strength was truly extraordinary, far beyond an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator—he even surpassed that level entirely.

Even prodigies like Wuchang and Xia Sheng might not have Wu Mengchuan’s depth.

As expected of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s descendant—even after years of solitary cultivation, he was no less than any elite.

But though Wu Mengchuan was formidable, Yang Kai was no pushover. As the punch came, he didn’t dodge but met it head-on with a punch of his own.

Boom boom boom...

Explosive sounds rang out as chaotic energies surged and clashed between them.

“Hm?” Wu Mengchuan was momentarily stunned, inwardly surprised. Yang Kai’s strength had caught him off guard.

He knew his own power—an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator was no match for him. Otherwise, he couldn’t have killed so many in the Shattered Star Sea, seized so many Star Seals, and advanced his Star Seal to be Seven-Pointed.

Precisely because of this, Wu Mengchuan’s eyes brightened as he shouted, “What kind of fortune have you had these years? Back then you were just at the Void King Realm, yet you’ve grown so strong so quickly. Truly, you’ve opened this Lord’s eyes.”

He didn’t know what kind of encounters Yang Kai had, but for someone to become so powerful in such a short time, Yang Kai’s luck was extraordinary. Still, no matter what opportunities Yang Kai had, as long as he killed him, everything would become his.

As he spoke, he suddenly lunged at Yang Kai, his fists raining down like a storm, his eyes wild yet still clear.

Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn. He quietly circulated the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi, the power of the five elements swirling around him, and faced Wu Mengchuan without fear.

Earlier, when they fought at the Origin Sea, both had been holding back, so neither knew the other’s limits.

But now, in this life-and-death battle, neither held anything back.

For a time, fists and feet flew as the two clashed fiercely.

In terms of physical cultivation, Yang Kai was clearly superior. With the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi, a body-tempering method, Wu Mengchuan quickly fell behind, taking blow after blow and ending up battered and miserable.

Wu Mengchuan was deeply shocked—he realized he had underestimated Yang Kai’s abilities.

In less than thirty breaths, Wu Mengchuan was covered in blood, looking utterly wretched.

Yet his eyes were still bright.

Yang Kai also sensed something was wrong. Anyone else would have been weakened by such a beating, but Wu Mengchuan’s aura wasn’t fading—in fact, it was growing stronger.

In contrast, Yang Kai himself was expending a lot of energy.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he shouted, “Old thief, you’re devouring my strength?!”

Watching closely, he finally noticed that every blow he landed on Wu Mengchuan mysteriously lost some of its power—clearly, Wu Mengchuan was devouring it.

Wu Mengchuan laughed loudly, “This Lord cultivates the Heaven Devouring Battle Art—none can oppose me! Unless you can kill me in one blow, you’re doomed!”

To kill Wu Mengchuan in a single strike—even a First Stage Emperor couldn’t do it. Only a Second Stage Emperor or stronger could manage that.

Realizing things were bad, Yang Kai quickly tried to retreat.

But Wu Mengchuan’s voice turned fierce as he roared, “In front of this Lord, you don’t get to come and go as you please! Heaven Devouring Domain—open!”

Boom!

An invisible domain exploded outward, instantly enveloping Yang Kai. Within this domain, he found his own power uncontrollably surging from his meridians, flowing toward Wu Mengchuan.

Not only that, even his Qi and blood were showing signs of being devoured.

And the speed was only increasing.

Yang Kai was horrified—only now did he truly experience the terror of the Heaven Devouring Battle Art. His Incarnation also cultivated it, but was far less accomplished, and had never developed such a domain that could devour all things.

In this domain, everything became Wu Mengchuan’s source of power. Anyone fighting him would inevitably be devoured, and in this cycle, Wu Mengchuan could easily win and kill his opponent.

Yang Kai was now in this awkward predicament.

“Such rich Qi and blood, such pure Origin Qi!” Wu Mengchuan’s eyes shone as he fought Yang Kai fiercely, exclaiming in delight, “Boy, you’ve tempered your body? Excellent, excellent! This is a great tonic—now I’m even more confident in advancing to the Emperor Realm!”

Yang Kai snorted, “You really want to devour me? Careful you don’t choke!”

As he spoke, he urged his Power of Space, causing the surrounding void to tremble and become unpredictable.

Wu Mengchuan’s eyes bulged in shock: “Th-this is... the Laws of Space!”

He looked as if he’d seen a ghost, utterly stunned.

But the next moment, he was overjoyed: “You actually comprehended the Laws of Space!”

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat—was this guy planning something?

Before he could finish the thought, Yang Kai sensed something was wrong and shouted, “Bastard, you can even devour Law Power?!”

Wu Mengchuan’s face showed wild delight as he opened himself to devour everything around him, praising, “Marvelous, marvelous! So this is the profundity of the Laws of Space—no wonder so few can cultivate them.”

By devouring Yang Kai’s Power of Space, he had actually gained some insight into the Laws of Space.

If this continued, and he truly grasped the mysteries of the Laws of Space, he would be able to cultivate the Power of Space and possess space-related divine abilities just like Yang Kai.

Only now did Yang Kai truly realize the terror of the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

This technique was truly a peerless art—there was nothing it couldn’t devour!

Just think—no matter how profound a Law Power, once used, someone cultivating the Heaven Devouring Battle Art could devour it, comprehend it, and cultivate it for themselves. It was outright plundering, and the opponent could do nothing about it.

No wonder, back in the Shattered Star Sea, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor could drag four top experts to their deaths with him. With such a divine art, who in the world could be his enemy?

This was practically cheating.

“This Lord is almost reluctant to kill you now.” Wu Mengchuan looked at Yang Kai with excitement, shouting, “Boy, I’ll give you one more chance—give up now, open your Sea of Consciousness, let me plant a Soul Brand, and when I one day rule the Star Domain and restore my ancestor’s glory, you too shall reign over the world. How about it?”

“Such a good deal?” Yang Kai gritted his teeth, glaring at him. But as he spoke, his hands didn’t stop—he waved, sending two massive Moon Blades slashing toward Wu Mengchuan.

Wu Mengchuan’s eyes lit up again, staring at the Moon Blades as if seeing something novel.

As the Moon Blades neared, he twisted aside to dodge, licking his lips with barely restrained excitement. “I really like your Laws of Space. As long as you help me comprehend this Law Power, I won’t treat you badly.”

“Fine, you can have anything you want! I only want one thing!” Yang Kai sneered softly.

Wu Mengchuan’s face darkened. “If it’s this Lord’s life, forget it.”

Yang Kai said, “You’re so clever—do your parents know?”

Wu Mengchuan roared, “My parents have long been dead! What do they have to do with this? Flames!”

As he shouted, Wu Mengchuan suddenly waved his hand, sending a torrent of fire at Yang Kai. Within the flames was the power of the Fire Law, seemingly able to burn all things.

Yang Kai was shocked—he knew this Fire Law wasn’t something Wu Mengchuan had comprehended himself, but was devoured from someone else using the Heaven Devouring Battle Art. Even so, this divine ability was not to be underestimated.

“Banishment!” He reached out, and a black hole appeared before him, swallowing the flames whole.

“Stubborn fool!” Wu Mengchuan’s face twisted in anger. Suddenly, two completely different Law Powers surged from his hands—fire twined around his left, ice covered his right. The two forces didn’t cancel each other out, but fused perfectly. He shouted, “Taste this Lord’s original creation—Ice and Fire Nine Heavens!”

Pa...

He clapped his hands together, and in an instant, the powers of ice and fire exploded, sweeping through the void and shattering the space.
