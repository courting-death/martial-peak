## Chapter 1196 — Lu Ye

Among the three walking together, the one in front — a middle-aged elder — finally couldn't bear his companion's endless grumbling and intervened: "Enough. Who can blame them — our Liu Yun Valley can't provoke them; just endure it and it'll pass. You know what kind of man he is, so why keep running your mouth?"

"I just can't swallow this," the man said with a face full of anger. "So what if it's the Battle Sky Alliance — Qu Changfeng still thinks highly of himself. If he didn't have the Battle Sky Alliance backing him, would he dare act like this? I think the man is all show; if it came to blows he absolutely wouldn't be a match for the two Senior Brothers."

The middle-aged elder's expression darkened as he reprimanded, "You're wrong to say that. Although Qu Changfeng is a spoiled bully with a bad reputation, he truly has genuine skill — otherwise, relying only on the Battle Sky Alliance's prestige, how could his name be known across the Dark Star? You know Fang Tianzhong of Leitai Sect, right? I've heard he's sparred with Qu Changfeng no fewer than ten times, and each time it ended in a draw. If he can hold his own against Fang Tianzhong, then I certainly wouldn't stand a chance. Never underestimate those with reputations; a name gives one confidence."

"Fang Tianzhong couldn't defeat him?" the Junior Brother asked in alarm, realizing he had underestimated Qu Changfeng's ability.

“Of course. That’s why every time those two meet, they clash head-on, like water and fire that cannot coexist. Your Senior Brother Lu Ye knows this very well,” the middle-aged elder said, glancing toward the third person as he spoke.

"Why would Senior Brother Ye know?"

The elder answered, "Because once Senior Brother Ye happened upon those two fighting outside. Junior Brother, tell him what happened back then, so he won't belittle heroes in future and lose his life without understanding why."

In an instant the Saint King Realm warrior at the Second Stage cast a curious glance toward the Senior Brother called Lu Ye.

Lu Ye, however, frowned tightly, as if lost in thought; his expression was unsettled, and he seemed not to have heard the elder's words.

"Junior Brother, what are you thinking about?" the middle-aged elder asked suspiciously — ever since coming out of that stone chamber, Lu Ye had seemed absent, as if sleepwalking, and he still hadn't recovered.

"Heh heh…" Lu Ye suddenly chuckled lowly. For some reason that laugh chilled the elder and the Second Stage Saint King Realm warrior to their bones, making their skin prickle.

The elder's face turned startled; he feared something had gone wrong with Lu Ye while soaking in the Soul Cleansing Divine Water. He hurriedly asked, "Junior Brother, are you all right?"

"Me? Of course I'm fine—I'm better than ever! Ha ha ha!" As he spoke, two eerie green glows flashed in Lu Ye's eyes like dancing ghost-fires, chilling to behold. His previously calm face suddenly contorted into a monstrous snarl, and he thrust out his hand. Saint Yuan surged through his palm and stabbed straight into the chest of the Second Stage Saint King Realm warrior.

The warrior could never have imagined that the usually gentle and courteous Senior Brother Ye would strike with murderous intent. When he felt the pain in his chest and looked down, he saw Lu Ye's hand already buried inside his body.

His heart convulsed uncontrollably. Then he watched Lu Ye pull his hand free, blood covering the hand, and in his palm gripped a heart still beating violently.

"Is that my heart?" the warrior's mind registered only that fleeting doubt before he toppled backward, a great hole in his chest spraying forth a torrent of blood.

"Lu Ye, what are you doing!" the middle-aged elder's face changed dramatically — never had he imagined such fratricide occurring right beneath his eyes.

With a furious shout he condensed Saint Yuan, preparing to strike at the one committing the atrocity.

Unexpectedly, a terrifying surge of Divine Sense power slammed into his mind, breaking through the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness in an instant and tossing his mental sea into chaos.

The middle-aged elder gave a muffled groan; in that instant his Sea of Consciousness was damaged, and the Saint Yuan he had condensed dissipated without a trace.

Immediately he saw Lu Ye leap at him with a feral smile; the jade-green glow in those eyes burned all the more eerie and bright.

"You are not—" the elder began in shocked protest, but before he could finish, Lu Ye cleaved his skull off with a palm-blade. Blood spurted out for several zhang.

Lu Ye floated down to a stand, shook the blood from his hand, snorted coldly and said, "Of course I'm not!"

Though he had seemingly dispatched two Saint King Realm warriors with ease, Lu Ye still wore a look of dissatisfaction; this body's aptitude was decent and suited to his method, but its cultivation was far too weak — compared to his prime it was as insignificant as an ant.

Yet Lu Ye felt content, for he had finally escaped that ghostly place. How many years had it been? Five thousand? Ten thousand? Twenty thousand?

Time had stretched until he no longer remembered. If another thousand years passed without anyone finding that stone chamber, his soul might truly dissipate into the world.

Back then, in order to break through some of the seals within that stone chamber and make it discoverable, he had even gone so far as to expend the very essence of his Soul. Otherwise, the location of that chamber might still be buried in dust to this day. Fortunately, all his efforts proved worthwhile — someone truly did go to that place, allowing his long-cherished wish to be fulfilled at last.

His face whitened for an instant before he forced it down. Forcibly using secret arts had taken a heavy toll on this body, and he still hadn't completely acclimated to the newly acquired form.

It seemed he couldn't employ any more secret arts for the time being.

Lifting his head to gaze at the sky, then looking toward the fiery red glow at the edge of the heavens where the Heat-Flame Zone lay, Lu Ye let out a cold laugh. “Three Suns Fire Ring—what a grand display!”

After speaking that inexplicably odd line, he searched the rings from the middle-aged elder and the Second Stage warrior, then burned the corpses and immediately turned to sprint toward where the stalactite cave lay.

Not long after, he returned.

The stone chamber was empty; the pool had been scraped clean. Even the pile of bones that had lain to one side seemed to have been disturbed and were scattered all over the ground.

Seeing this, a flash of anger passed through Lu Ye's eyes. He stooped and carefully gathered the broken bones, picking up every single piece and placing them into the Spatial Ring.

While doing so his expression was odd — part sorrow, part remembrance.

After collecting the bones he slipped into the empty pool and stood in thought for a while, then began to walk in an irregular pattern. With each step he poured some Saint Yuan into the pool's bottom, the force varying from light to heavy. Lu Ye's face was grave, as if he were undertaking something immensely important.

After walking like this for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Lu Ye’s eyes gradually began to show a trace of anticipation.

After a moment he halted; with his final step he channeled a precisely measured surge of Saint Yuan.

Crack...

At the very center of the pool's bottom a fissure split open, revealing a hidden compartment.

Seeing this, Lu Ye finally smiled in earnest. He strode forward, retrieved a Spatial Ring hidden in the compartment, slipped it onto his hand and took a heavy breath.

With that ring he could easily make a comeback.

What enraged him, however, was that his most important possession had been taken by that First Stage Saint King Realm warrior — and that warrior's body carried an odd burning black flame. When Lu Ye had entered the body attempting to usurp it, he had nearly had his soul utterly consumed by that flame.

He had never seen that kind of black flame before — cold and hot alternating, right and wrong intertwined, a contradiction to the extreme.

In panic Lu Ye had fled; had he lingered three more breaths inside that body, he had no doubt he would have been burned to ashes.

That was truly an excellent body — if only he could have seized it for himself. Lu Ye couldn’t help feeling a trace of regret.

"How dare you take what belongs to me," Lu Ye sneered, sending out his Divine Sense to search. He believed that so long as Yang Kai carried the item, even hidden within a Spatial Ring, he could pinpoint it.

After all, that thing had once been his.

But when he searched he was horrified — he could not sense the slightest trace of it; as if it had vanished into thin air.

"Impossible!" Lu Ye roared in madness, his face hysterical. He couldn't accept that the item's aura had disappeared; the only possibility was that the other had fused with it.

But a mere First Stage of the Saint King Realm — no matter how capable — could not fuse such an item; attempting to do so would have killed him instantly!

That item had been Lu Ye's most precious possession; once revealed it could stir blood and upheaval across the entire Star Domain. Now it was gone, and of course he was furious. Without it, regaining his Divine Sense cultivation would take him at least another two or three thousand years.

By this time Yang Kai had already gone fifty li from the stalactite cave.

Sensing Qu Changfeng's killing intent, he had immediately left the area and wandered with no particular aim.

At first he had intended to enter the heaven-and-earth treasure district to scavenge, but once inside he was disappointed by the local yields of Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine.

Apart from the unexpected gain of a Cui Luo Grass, the other finds were nothing remarkable — things one could buy on the market. Though expensive, he had no shortage of money and no need to waste time gathering them here.

The greatest gain had been what he obtained in the stalactite cave.

The medicinal effects of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water need no elaboration. He himself did not benefit greatly — his Divine Sense only improved marginally, for his Divine Sense foundation was already much stronger than ordinary cultivators — but the nourishment bestowed upon the Warm Spirit Lotus was beyond imagination; that was the main prize.
