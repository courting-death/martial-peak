## Chapter 640 — Since You Have Come, Settle In

The beautiful woman's words sounded like praise but were actually sarcastic; Yang Kai laughed and said, "The cunning and craftiness of humanity are as famed across the continent as the brutality and ferocity of your demon race."

"You truly have a bold streak," the beautiful woman smiled helplessly. "Enough — I won't bicker with you over these things. Dealing with clever people is always easier than dealing with idiots. Since you claim to be so clever, why not guess what we want from you?"

"That I do not know," Yang Kai shook his head. "I don't know what it is about me that attracted you to the point of having a Saint-Grade expert capture and bring me here. If it's convenient, could you reveal a little?"

Seeing him speak so calmly and appear so at ease, the beautiful woman found him all the more interesting.

She stared deeply at Yang Kai for a long moment before finally resuming her seat and giving a slight nod.

From her right, another woman with a cold, icy beauty suddenly spoke: "Your Divine Sense strength is different from ordinary people — that's precisely why we took a liking to you!"

"So it is..." Yang Kai forced a wry smile.

He had suspected as much already. It was precisely because he had secretly used a bit of his Divine Sense that the Coffin-Bearer had noticed him; before that, he had been left alone.

"You possess the Divine Sense Fire, do you not?" an elderly man with white hair asked in a low voice. "If you did not possess the Divine Sense Fire, Senior Coffin-Servant would not have sent you in."

There was no point denying it now; Yang Kai nodded calmly. "Indeed, I possess the Divine Sense Fire."

At his admission, every face in the hall stirred. The beautiful woman looked at Yang Kai with even greater anticipation and murmured, "Could you display the full extent of your Divine Sense power so we might see your worth?"

Yang Kai frowned, considered for a moment, and then nodded. "All right, but I have many questions..."

"I can answer them all for you!" the beautiful woman said with a serious tone.

"It's a deal!" Yang Kai grinned, then released his Divine Sense.

In an instant the entire hall seemed to boil, a searing heat like molten rock sweeping through the space.

The beautiful woman's expression changed; evidently she had not expected Yang Kai's Divine Sense to be so strong. She hurriedly formed a barrier to wrap the delicate-looking girl and shield her from the blast. The cold beauty and the elder also used their own means to protect those of their kin below the Transcendent Realm.

The outburst of power lasted only a moment before Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense.

The beautiful woman, the cold beauty, and the elder stared at him, three pairs of eyes alight with excitement, as if they had found a treasure.

"Unexpectedly, your Divine Sense is so powerful. You must have obtained some uncommon opportunity," the beautiful woman speculated.

A youth of the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage, under ordinary circumstances could not possess Divine Sense strength beyond his cultivation level; only extraordinary fate or opportunity could account for such an achievement.

"That is my affair," Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Now, can you answer my questions?"

The beautiful woman smiled slyly. "I can only tell you this: we bear you no ill will. Not only that, we will cultivate you."

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, then flared up in anger. "You lied to me?"

The beautiful woman pursed her lips and smiled. "Deceit and counter-deceit — this is a trick learned from you humans."

"I'll remember that," Yang Kai said, no longer speaking further, only fixing the beautiful woman with a cold stare.

As they spoke, a violent, ruthless aura suddenly issued from outside the hall and quickly drew near.

Everyone inside frowned; the beautiful woman showed a trace of helplessness on her face, as if she feared the approaching visitor.

Soon a broad-shouldered man strode into the hall, bare-chested and wearing only a strip of leather around his waist. His visage was fierce, and murderous intent flowed from his brow. He glanced at Yang Kai and snorted, pointing at him as he asked, "Is this the human Senior Coffin-Servant brought in? He looks weaker than the last one — what use is someone like this?"

"Chu Jian, do not be presumptuous!" the elder thundered.

The man called Chu Jian sneered at the elder, then half-kneeling, clasped his fist toward the beautiful woman who sat at the head and said, "I pay my respects, Lady Li."

The beautiful woman inclined her head slightly, her expression faint, and said, "You may rise. Take a seat."

“No need for such ceremony,” Chu Jian waved a hand. “I only heard that Senior Coffin-Servant had brought someone in again, so I came to see what ability he had. Now that I’ve seen him, it’s truly disappointing. Lady Li, this brat is so young — just kill him and be done with it, rather than have our clan wait in vain for another ten years. The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. After all the heavy losses we’ve suffered, Lady Li, have you still not learned your lesson?”

“Chu Jian, you grow more and more insolent—have you forgotten the ancestral teachings?” the elder roared, dark power surging around him.

Chu Jian gave a cold snort, his tone dangerous. “I’m only speaking the truth. How can the fate of our clan be entrusted to some unknown human whelp? We need not rely on his strength. I, Chu Jian, will lead our people to break free of this cage! Lady Li, what do you say?”

The beautiful woman's chest rose and fell, but she forced a smile. "If Chu Jian thinks this, then it may be a blessing for our people. We shall wait and see; we'll hold some expectation for Chu Jian, hoping you will soon realize your wish and fulfill our ancestors' long-cherished aim."

Chu Jian chuckled darkly, cast a sinister look at Yang Kai, and sneered, "Human brat, be careful from now on. This place is no place like the outside — perhaps some danger will take your life! Farewell." With that, he left in a hurry.

As he departed, the expressions of everyone in the hall turned sour.

Yang Kai's eyes flicked about; he quickly discerned some irregularities.

It seemed that Chu Jian's arrival had killed the mood for further discussion. The beautiful woman waved a hand and said, "Guan'er, take him down to rest."

"Yes." The delicate girl responded, stepped down from the beautiful woman's side, and waved to Yang Kai, "Follow me."

Yang Kai said nothing and followed.

After Yang Kai left, the elder sighed in the hall. "Lady Li, Chu Jian grows more outrageous by the day. Should we not take action? Leaving him alive will make this region unsafe."

The beautiful woman hesitated and said nothing.

The cold, elegant woman added, "My lady, the more lenience you show to someone like Chu Jian, the more he will take it for weakness. It is time to teach him a lesson."

"I'll think on it more carefully," the beautiful woman said with a bitter smile. "Our people are few in number now. If we act against Chu Jian, there may be losses... For the moment, you should return. Once I decide, I will send word."

"Very well." The cold beauty and the elder nodded slightly; they understood the beautiful woman's reluctance to cause internal strife and lose kin, and their hatred for Chu Jian only deepened.

Over the years, as Chu Jian's strength had risen, so too had his arrogant ambition.

…………

Yang Kai walked with the delicate Guan'er through the stone city, occasionally passing a demon here or there. Guan'er kept muttering ahead, as if scolding someone.

Yang Kai suddenly asked, "That Chu Jian, he really doesn't seem to hold your lady in any regard, does he?"

"That wretch!" Guan'er snapped angrily. "He thinks himself so great, but he's only a wolf's ambition, always scheming to rule this region. Were it not for our lady's mercy, Chu Jian would have died countless times."

"Indeed, a woman's mercy can sometimes cause harm," Yang Kai agreed.

"Don't you dare speak ill of my lady; she is the gentlest of women!" Guan'er glared at Yang Kai.

"I'm not saying she is bad," Yang Kai raised a hand. "But can you tell me where exactly this place is? Why did you bring me here, and what do you want me to do?"

Guan'er pursed her lips and giggled. "Until my lady tells me to speak, I won't blurt things out. Though you humans are sly and treacherous, I'm not a three-year-old. You trying to get me to talk — do you think I don't see through it?"

Yang Kai curled his mouth.

"Trust me, we truly will not harm you. As my lady said, we will cultivate you. If you can fulfill my lady's wish, you'll gain many benefits."

"Cultivate me — cultivate me how?" Yang Kai pressed. "What exactly do you intend to use my Divine Sense Fire for?"

Guan'er clammed up and would not say another word no matter how Yang Kai questioned her, keeping all things close to her chest.

Before long they arrived at a stone room. Guan'er said, "This will be your residence from now on. You need not worry about anything; we will prepare everything for you. Although no one will be watching you here, do not attempt to run. You cannot get out — the space here has been sealed; you should have noticed that."

Yang Kai glared at her in displeasure.

Guan'er smiled, pursing her lips. "There's no use arguing with me; I only follow orders. All right, I'll come to see you tomorrow."

Saying that, she shoved Yang Kai into the stone room, closed the door, and strode away.

After she left, Yang Kai tested the stone door; it opened and closed at will, and indeed no one seemed to be watching him.

Yet in such a sealed space in unfamiliar territory, Yang Kai had no desire to flee.

He was certain that no matter where he ran, the beautiful woman could easily fetch him back.

Since he had come, he might as well settle in. Yang Kai quickly adjusted his mindset, closed the stone door, and began to examine his lodgings.

To his surprise the room was vast, far larger than the hall they had just left, and a faint medicinal fragrance permeated the air.

In one corner dozens of medicine cauldrons of various sizes were arranged.

The large cauldrons were the size of water jars; the small ones were only palm-sized.

The floor was littered with the fragments left from failed pill concoctions.

Yang Kai frowned.

The room looked to be the quarters of an alchemist.

Walking among the cauldrons, Yang Kai discovered that they had all been used — someone had indeed brewed pills with them.

In another corner he found a long table piled with many things resembling books.
