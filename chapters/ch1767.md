## Chapter 1767 — Ethereal Crystal

The surroundings were a chaotic void, as if falling toward an endless abyss; Xue Yue could not help but grip Yang Kai's hand, her whole body pressed against his, seeking that thread of safety.

She had never experienced anything like this before. Spatial rifts were regarded as terrifying monsters by experts of the Void King Realm, yet this time she had been the one to rush in.

She did not know what Yang Kai was relying on, but she could only choose, wishfully, to believe—that this man who had just treated her with outrageous rudeness would not truly put her in harm's way.

Yang Kai did not disappoint her. In that skyless, dim rift he showed no hint of fear; instead he patted her hand.

Feeling Yang Kai's reassurance, Xue Yue's mood immediately relaxed considerably.

"What do we do now?" Xue Yue asked.

She turned her head, wanting to glance back at the entrance they had entered through earlier, but it was already nowhere to be seen. Spatial rifts were ever-shifting and unpredictable, with space itself distorted—entering from one point could, in an instant, send one tens of thousands or even millions of li away. At this moment, finding the way back was naturally impossible.

“Don’t worry.” Yang Kai’s tone was uncharacteristically gentle as he chuckled. “Just leave this to me.”

Xue Yue gave a slight nod. Yang Kai’s words seemed to carry a soothing magic that calmed her heart and eased her entire being.

“What a dense fluctuation of Spatial Force… Mm, this place truly is extraordinary. Looks like I should’ve come in long ago.” Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to survey the surroundings, appearing somewhat regretful.

His expression turned serious; he began to circulate Spatial Force, feeling the wonder around him and comprehending the unique power within this void rift. It felt delightful.

This kind of experience was greatly beneficial to his cultivation of spatial power; of course he did not want to miss it.

After a while his gaze moved to a spot and he said, "Follow me."

Saying that, he pulled Xue Yue and sped toward that direction.

Within the void rift, there was nothing—only chaos. It was as though this place were a heaven and earth yet to be opened, devoid of life, devoid of Spiritual Qi, an existence even more absolute than that of a Dead Star.

Xue Yue could sense nothing at all, except for the touch and warmth from the large hand that gripped hers; so she held on tightly, afraid of being separated from Yang Kai.

In this ghastly place even time seemed to stretch interminably, yet once Xue Yue steadied her mind she did not reject it. On the contrary, she enjoyed the journey.

A man holding her hand, cutting through danger up ahead—he bore the hazards while she followed behind at ease; such an experience was practically a luxury for her.

As Third Young Master Xue Yue and the future successor of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, she was normally the one to charge ahead and clear the path! She needed to establish prestige before her subordinates, to consolidate her position in the Hengluo Commerce Guild, and she even had to disguise her gender, her tone, and her manner of acting—she lived a life more exhausting than many others.

Here she could discard it all and simply enjoy being cared for.

Yang Kai had just said she had it hard too—perhaps he had spoken casually without thinking—but that remark hit the softest place in Xue Yue's heart and almost brought her to tears.

At that moment her heart was warm; she only hoped such moments would last forever.

By now, if she still could not see that Yang Kai was masterful with spatial power, then Xue Yue would not be the Young Master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

She did not point that out. A clever woman knew when to speak and when to remain silent.

She did not know how much time had passed; Xue Yue remained immersed in that warming atmosphere, when faint glimmers suddenly appeared in the distance—weak lights like a few stars in a Star Domain, dotting this void world.

"Ha!" Yang Kai laughed loudly, his mood apparently very cheerful. "This place truly nurtures Ethereal Crystals; Luo Lan didn't lie to me!"

Xue Yue paused, then realized and said, "Those are Ethereal Crystals? You came into this place looking for Ethereal Crystals?"

"Exactly!" Yang Kai nodded and quickened his pace.

The points of starlight looked far away, but Yang Kai approached them in less than half an incense stick's time.

The light was faint, barely worth mentioning, yet within the void rift it already counted as the only source of illumination.

Up close, each of these Ethereal Crystals was about the size of a fist, each shaped like a hexagon. They were crystal clear throughout, and their interiors were crisscrossed with fine fissures from which distinct fluctuations of spatial power streamed.

"They aren't quite like the ones I got before." Yang Kai was extremely surprised and did not hurry to take them; instead he examined them with interest. These Ethereal Crystals differed greatly from those he had obtained previously—in both form and the power fluctuations within, especially those fine fissures, which the earlier Ethereal Crystals had never possessed.

"Of course they wouldn't be the same," Xue Yue looked at him as if she knew something.

"How so?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"These Ethereal Crystals are the genuine sort—the true Ethereal Crystal. They are nurtured by spatial power itself. The Ethereal Crystals outside are merely byproducts of various mineral veins and contain many impurities. Although they can be considered a type of Ethereal Crystal, compared to these their grade is far inferior." Xue Yue reached out and casually picked up one, the action effortless. It was as if someone had left it here without care; taking it was no difficulty. Pointing to the fine fissures she said, "Look at this—its power is already enough to affect space. If a secret technique were used to detonate this Ethereal Crystal, it could cause a large-scale spatial collapse; anyone caught in it would be in terrible shape."

"Ethereal Crystals can be used like that?" Yang Kai suddenly became interested and looked at Xue Yue thoughtfully. "Your Commerce Guild has such secret techniques, right?"

"There should be some." Xue Yue nodded. "I've heard of them, though I've never come into contact with that kind of technique myself."

As she spoke she handed an Ethereal Crystal to Yang Kai and continued, "Moreover, Spatial Rings refined with these Ethereal Crystals would form enormous internal space, far superior to ordinary Spatial Rings. However... I doubt any artificer would dare refine a Spatial Ring with this material—that would be to gamble with one's life."

As they spoke, the only four Ethereal Crystals present were already in Yang Kai's possession.

He silently sensed them and found the Spatial Force contained within these Ethereal Crystals beyond imagination. If he could gather twenty of them, he could set up a Great Space Array, and the teleportation ranges would be even farther than the ones he had arranged before.

"These Ethereal Crystals can't be placed inside a Spatial Ring; what do you plan to do?" Xue Yue looked at what was in Yang Kai's hand and asked.

Yang Kai had noticed the problem without her pointing it out.

He had tried to place the Ethereal Crystals into a Spatial Ring earlier but had failed; the power within the Ethereal Crystals violently conflicted with the Spatial Ring and would not be accepted.

After some thought Yang Kai communicated with the Xuan Realm Pearl by mind.

The next moment the Ethereal Crystals were tossed into the Xuan Realm Pearl!

Yang Kai breathed a little easier. It seemed the Xuan Realm Pearl was an extremely high-grade treasure—after all, it was an Imperial Treasure—and inside it constituted its own realm, complete with its own world laws, so accommodating the Ethereal Crystals caused no issue.

Xue Yue was momentarily surprised and lightly laughed, "Looks like you carry quite a few secrets on you."

"Does that make you more interested in me?" Yang Kai grinned mischievously.

"Don't be silly!" Xue Yue shot him a reproachful look.

"I do have many secrets. Well... when I can tell you, I will." Yang Kai's expression turned serious as he said in a low voice.

Xue Yue slowly shook her head. "I don't need to know them. I only want one person who will treat me as a woman—that's enough."

Hearing her heartfelt words, Yang Kai looked at her for a moment, smiled slightly, and once more took Xue Yue's hand as they flew onward.

An hour later, more points of starlight entered the two of their sights within the void rift...

Repeating like this for a few days, the Ethereal Crystals Yang Kai collected had already amounted to nearly a hundred; this void rift seemed to be the best breeding ground for Ethereal Crystals, where dense concentrations of spatial power condensed and crystallized.

Xue Yue silently followed Yang Kai, helping him gather Ethereal Crystals without a single complaint.

The dangers of the outside Lost Realm felt extremely far away to them; the world they had entered had nothing to do with others.

One day, while Yang Kai continued to search for Ethereal Crystals with Xue Yue, she suddenly called out sweetly, "Yang Kai, look over there!"

"What is it?" Yang Kai stopped and turned toward the direction Xue Yue indicated. With a single glance his expression changed; he whispered, "So many?"

In that direction, like a moonless night, innumerable lights—some bright, some dim—blossomed in the void like lamps in the dark, pointing the way.

Having stayed here several days, Yang Kai naturally knew that each point of light represented an Ethereal Crystal nurtured here—each a tremendous fortune.

He had already been quite satisfied after collecting more than a hundred, but seeing that scene he realized his ambitions had been too small.

The dense lights over there numbered far more than a hundred.

There were at least several hundred, possibly thousands!

"Hahaha!" Yang Kai laughed uncontrollably. He reached out, dragged Xue Yue into his embrace, and planted a fierce kiss on her cheek.

Such rough treatment left Xue Yue clearly displeased. Biting her red lips, she wiped her cheek and huffed angrily, "You crude man!"

Yang Kai said nothing, already streaking toward that direction with her.
