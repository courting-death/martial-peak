## Chapter 1755 — The Past Like a Dream

A party of four, after some discussion, decided to find a nearby place to recuperate for a while; after all, during the opening of the Lost Land entrance just now, Ni Guang and Luo Lan had both expended enormous amounts of energy, and in a place teeming with danger they had to keep themselves in the best possible condition to face any threats ahead.

Fortunately there was no sign of abnormality nearby. Ni Guang led them and casually slipped down into a ravine, concealing their figures.

Here, ravines crisscrossed in all directions, jagged and interwoven like countless canyons of varying size. After descending into the depths, one could only faintly see the dim light filtering down from above when looking up. This place was at least several hundred zhang beneath the surface.

Cold, sinister winds blew along the bottom of the ravine, and it felt bitterly cold.

Yang Kai and Xue Yue were full of energy; although their cultivation did not reach the Void King Realm, their strength was not weak, so the duty of protection naturally fell to the two of them.

Ni Guang and Luo Lan each chose a spot not far from the other, took Spiritual Pills, and sat cross‑legged.

Yang Kai kept watch by Luo Lan, while Xue Yue guarded Ni Guang, each fulfilling their role.

Heaven and earth were silent, everything hushed; only the gusts of cold wind sweeping along the ravine bottom reached their ears, lending an extra edge of horror to the place.

Xue Yue glanced left and right from time to time, looking somewhat nervous.

No matter how profound her cultivation or how strong she was, she was still a woman, and she had an instinctive fear and vigilance toward such an environment.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, looked unconcerned; he closed his eyes and released his Divine Sense to watch the surroundings in case anything unexpected happened.

Time passed slowly. After an unknown interval, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes...

He found himself lying on a bed — a wooden plank bed, hard in texture. Looking up revealed a crude roof, drafty in places. Turning his head and looking around, the furnishings were utterly sparse: only a table and a chair.

The scene felt familiar. Yang Kai could not help wearing an expression of puzzlement; his mind was muddled, and his thoughts would not connect coherently.

He instinctively felt that something was very wrong, as if he had forgotten something important; the more he tried to recall it, the more pain stabbed at his mind.

He could not even remember what he had been doing before.

He shook his head, rose from the crude wooden bed, pushed open the door and stepped out, standing outside to take a look...

Memories surged like a tide in his mind. Yang Kai immediately recalled that he was now a Trial Disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion; having been in the sect for only three years he had repeatedly failed to meet the sect's cultivation requirements, so he could not be promoted to a full disciple and had to sweep the sect's floors to make a living while he cultivated, hoping one day to achieve his wish and become a formal disciple.

There was a broom outside the hut. It was still dark; this was the blackest hour before dawn.

Yang Kai gave a wry laugh, took up the broom, and began his day's work.

Along the sect's various main and side paths, before the Contribution Hall, the Trial Martial Hall, and the Martial Skill Hall, Yang Kai's busy figure remained; the roads were swept clean. He was the lowest disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion and the most toilsome among them.

As day gradually broke, many Senior Brothers and Sisters gathered around Yang Kai, preparing to challenge him.

In the end, a junior brother who was only at the fourth Stage of Qi Refining won first place and gave Yang Kai a thorough beating before striding away.

Lying on the ground, gasping for breath and feeling weakness and bodily pain, Yang Kai slowly curled his hand into a fist.

As if sensing something, his gaze shifted to a large tree not far away.

On that tree a figure silently stood, balancing on one foot upon the canopy; her features were obscured by a veil, her figure graceful, a sapphire‑like ornament on her forehead, and her eyes clear and innocent like pure water without flaw.

Yang Kai watched her quietly and inexplicably felt that this woman seemed important to him, though he could not understand why he felt that way.

Their eyes met for only a moment, then the veiled woman swayed and vanished without a trace.

Her disappearance sent a sudden ache through his chest, as if someone had grabbed at his heart and squeezed, making it hard to breathe. Yang Kai shook his head, painfully climbed to his feet, picked up the broom, and trudged back to his small hut step by step.

He ultimately failed to meet the sect's requirements within the time limit; he still could not become a full disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion...

When he was expelled from the Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai quietly packed his belongings into a small bundle and took the road down the mountain that he had walked countless times before.

Standing at the mountain gate, Yang Kai looked back at the plaque engraved with the three characters "Lingxiao Pavilion," hesitated, and let his thoughts drift.

He was only fifteen years old, and the future lay before him in utter confusion.

Down the mountain a group of Senior Brothers and Sisters approached; at their head stood a woman holding a sword, her temperament cold, pure as jade, like an ice doll, exquisitely clear. She wore a spotless white dress and was surrounded like a moon among stars by the others. They chatted and laughed as they soon drew near to where Yang Kai stood.

Noticing his unusual state, the leading woman stopped and looked at Yang Kai, her red lips parting as she said, "Junior Brother, are you going down the mountain?"

Yang Kai turned to look, and upon seeing her face he was momentarily stunned and blurted out, "Su Yan..."

The name startled him; although he had been in the Lingxiao Pavilion three years and was familiar with this Senior Sister and had seen her valiant bearing many times, they had never once exchanged words.

After all, this Senior Sister of the Lingxiao Pavilion stood far above, while Yang Kai was merely a Trial Disciple; their differences in strength and status were too great for them to speak.

He did not know why he suddenly cried out her name so familiarly, as if he had shouted it countless times; the name seemed to haunt his soul.

Su Yan frowned slightly but did not show much expression; the several Senior Brothers and Sisters who had followed her, who were not weak in strength, cast contemptuous looks at Yang Kai.

One hot‑tempered Senior Brother snorted coldly and said without courtesy, "You can even call out Senior Sister's name?"

As the words left him, he suddenly struck out at Yang Kai with a palm.

The palm wind was mighty; Yang Kai was blown flying, his body spinning in midair before he hit the ground with a thud, blood welling at the corner of his mouth, his clothes stained with dust, looking wretched.

Yang Kai felt little of the bodily pain; he frowned and lay on the ground, sinking into deep thought.

He could not understand why he was like this — everything here was at once familiar and strange to him...

A fragrance stirred and a pair of jade feet paused not far from his face. Yang Kai looked up and saw Su Yan standing before him. Her incomparable beauty and awe‑inspiring presence made her seem like a goddess beyond reach.

"Senior Sister, there's no need to pay him any mind!" the Senior Brother who had struck Yang Kai snorted, his face full of displeasure.

Su Yan did not answer. Instead she reached out a hand to Yang Kai, seemingly to help him up.

Yang Kai hesitated for a moment, placed his hand in Su Yan's palm, and with her support stood up.

The Senior Brother who resented Yang Kai watched with a twisted face, furious beyond measure; he had never imagined that his one reckless attack would give Yang Kai an opportunity to touch Senior Sister's skin.

Yang Kai stood there dazed; Su Yan reached out and brushed the dust from his clothes, and in that moment the coldness that always seemed etched on her face vanished.

That gentle expression stunned Yang Kai, and yet it felt entirely natural to him.

"The outside world is perilous. If you are going down the mountain, set out early and be careful on the road; leave early and return early," Su Yan advised, looking at Yang Kai intently before turning and continuing toward the Lingxiao Pavilion.

Yang Kai stood watching her go, feeling an inexplicable emptiness in his heart.

From a distance the Senior Brother's mocking voice drifted over: "Senior Sister, that fellow was only a Trial Disciple expelled from the sect; he won't return, so you needn't worry about him..."

"Is that so..." Su Yan's voice came as if in thought. "He should return."

The beautiful figure receded until she could no longer be seen.

Yang Kai's gaze swept to another corner, where a Senior Sister in a green dress with a thin veil over her face stood quietly.

The bustling wind lifted her veil and Yang Kai saw her lips move, as if she was saying something to him.

But she was too far away; Yang Kai could not hear clearly. Just as he wanted to call out and ask, that Senior Sister had already vanished.

In the end... he only knew that Senior Sister's name.

Xia Ningshang!

Perhaps it was a name he would remember for the rest of his life.

Yang Kai picked up his bundle from the ground, turned, and strode away.

Yang Kai did not take part in the Yang Family's Succession War in Zhongdu because his strength was insufficient and he could not rally much support; even if he had joined it would have been self‑humiliation.

His eldest brother, Yang Wei, smoothly became the candidate for the next Family Head through his extraordinary strength and prestige, and the family pinned high hopes on him and cultivated him strongly.

Time passed; Yang Kai was now eighteen.

His father Yang Yingfeng and his mother Dong Suzhu arranged a marriage for him with a girl from his mother's natal family; it was a match deemed appropriate.

Yang Kai had little choice; his stubborn pursuit of the Martial Dao had not brought him great gains. As a member of the Yang Family, upon reaching a certain age he had to contribute to the family — at the very least to produce offspring and keep the family line flourishing.

He and the girl were married and had children.

By day he rushed about attending to the Yang Family's businesses; at night he returned to his residence to enjoy family life. His wife obeyed him in everything, and his children were obedient and well behaved.

It was a very happy family.

Yet somewhere in Yang Kai's heart, something long simmered and stirred.

He felt that his life should not be like this; he should have another chance, another earth‑shaking great feat to achieve.

He tried to dispel such outrageous thoughts, but they were like cellar wine — the more he hid them, the stronger they became, impossible to drive away and always on the verge of bursting out.
