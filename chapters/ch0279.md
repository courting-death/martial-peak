## Chapter 279 — It Shouldn't Be Like This

On Hidden Cloud Peak, Meng Wuya wore a face full of indignation, while Xia Ningshang supported her master, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Xiao Fusheng's expression was peculiar as he glanced at Xia Ningshang and then at Yang Kai, a glimmer of understanding flashing in his eyes. Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan were lost in a fog, bewildered by the situation.

Dong Qingyan quietly leaned towards Yang Kai, poking him with her finger: “Hey… stop staring at her like that, you’re making her face turn red.”

“Do you know each other?” Xiao Fusheng asked with a smile, looking at everyone.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, smiling as he performed the disciple's greeting: “Shopkeeper Meng…”

Turning his head, he wore a gentle expression: “Senior Sister!”

Xia Ningshang's delicate earlobes were flushed with crimson, her head lowered as she softly replied, “Junior Brother…”

Her voice trembled, clearly unsettled within.

“Ahem…” Meng Wuya quickly cleared his throat, interrupting the tender atmosphere, rolling his eyes: “Elder Xiao, as a guest, are you really going to leave me standing outside?”

Xiao Fusheng laughed heartily: “Brother Meng, please, let’s talk inside!”

Though filled with questions, Xiao Fusheng was astute enough to notice Meng Wuya's disciple had some feelings for Yang Kai. When they first met, this young girl was only about twelve years old, and Meng Wuya had cherished her like a treasure. Now, as she began to blossom into a young woman, Meng Wuya must be worried about her feelings.

It was understandable! If such a beautiful and innocent girl were to join his sect, he would certainly be concerned about her making the wrong choice and suffering for it.

Meng Wuya and Xiao Fusheng entered together, while Xia Ningshang nodded slightly at Yang Kai, quickly following behind.

Gently, Meng Wuya's voice drifted over with the wind: “Disciple, look at this scoundrel, he’s quite the flirt, always surrounded by beauties wherever he goes, a true lecher. You must keep your eyes wide open.”

Xia Ningshang obediently nodded.

“This old man…” Dong Qingyan pouted, clearly displeased.

Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan stifled their laughter, glancing at Yang Kai in surprise, and followed suit to serve tea.

“Cousin… who is that?” Once everyone entered the room, Dong Qingyan curiously asked.

“A Senior Sister from Lingxiao Pavilion,” Yang Kai replied casually.

“Just a Senior Sister?” Dong Qingyan chuckled mischievously.

Yang Kai shot her a glance and walked back to his room.

Dong Qingyan stood there, her fingers playfully tapping her red lips. After a moment, she said, “Hmph, do you really think I can’t see? She’s not a child!”

After thinking for a while, she suddenly began to giggle uncontrollably.

Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang's visit to Yao Wang Valley was beyond Yang Kai's expectations.

Although the alchemy conference was approaching, Yang Kai had considered that someone from Lingxiao Pavilion would come to participate. However, due to Xia Ningshang's unique constitution, her alchemy skills were unmatched by the younger generation of alchemists. If she participated, there would be no need for the conference; she would undoubtedly take first place.

Moments later, a knock sounded at the door. Yang Kai smiled slightly, stood up, and opened the door to find Xia Ningshang standing there, looking charming.

“Junior Brother!” Xia Ningshang’s starry eyes sparkled with joy at their reunion, softly calling out.

“Come in,” Yang Kai stepped aside.

Xia Ningshang nodded gently, stepping in with a waft of fragrant air.

Yang Kai closed the door behind her.

“Why are you here?” Yang Kai asked while pouring her a cup of water.

“Master said there’s the best alchemist in the world here, and asked me to seek guidance!” Xia Ningshang sat down quietly, clearly a bit nervous after not seeing him for over a year, but more so, she was happy.

“Indeed, Elder Xiao is truly the best alchemist in the world,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“Junior Brother, how did you end up here?” Xia Ningshang looked up and asked, “Didn’t you go to Ghostly Underworld Mountain?”

“It’s a long story,” Yang Kai sighed with a bitter smile, not wanting to elaborate. He simply said, “I have something to do here.”

“What is it? Can I help?” 

Yang Kai didn’t want to hide it from her, but there was a wisp of ethereal Divine Sense drifting in the room, and it was clear that Meng Wuya was eavesdropping.

Yang Kai chuckled, waved at Xia Ningshang, and leaned in close to whisper in her ear.

Xia Ningshang's heart raced, her body tensed up, her face turning bright red, and she didn’t dare to move, even holding her breath.

Yang Kai ignored her reaction and continued to lean in close to her delicate ear, softly saying, “I’m going to Dan Sheng Peak to check out Wan Yao Pool.”

“Uh… oh…” Xia Ningshang responded absentmindedly, her fingers tightening around the teacup, not fully comprehending what Yang Kai was saying.

“Ahem… ahem…” From the nearby room, Meng Wuya's loud coughing interrupted.

“Brother Meng!” Across from him, Xiao Fusheng looked at him helplessly, chuckling as he advised, “Some things are best left to nature; you can’t prevent everything.”

“Indeed, indeed.” Meng Wuya nodded repeatedly, his face flushed as he withdrew his Divine Sense.

Though he cared for his disciple, he couldn’t constantly spy on her. However, the thought of his precious disciple being alone with that scoundrel just a few dozen feet away, and how close they were, made Meng Wuya feel uneasy.

Ah, out of sight, out of mind!

Inside, Xia Ningshang remained stiff for a long moment, still feeling the warmth of Yang Kai's breath near her ear. Her heart raced, and after a while, she suddenly reacted: “Ah… Junior Brother, you’re going to…”

“Shh…”

Xia Ningshang quickly hushed, then suddenly said, “I want to go there too.”

“You want to go?” Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

Xia Ningshang nodded slightly: “Master said there are hidden secrets there, and it’s possible there are insights from a generation of alchemy masters, so he wants me to take a look. I just don’t know if the owner here will allow it.”

“If it’s you, Senior Sister, Elder Xiao might just agree!” Yang Kai frowned in thought. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.

He still didn’t know what was hidden in Wan Yao Pool. If he could use Xia Ningshang to investigate first, it would make things easier.

It would be best if he could go himself, but even though Elder Xiao treated him well, he wouldn’t casually open Wan Yao Pool. Meng Wuya had saved his life, and Xia Ningshang was a Medicinal Spirit Saint Body. It was already the limit for Elder Xiao to make an exception for her.

Senior Sister was truly a lifesaver, arriving just in time, Yang Kai felt overjoyed.

Just as he was feeling happy, Yang Kai suddenly glanced towards the door, snorted softly, and flicked his fingers, sending out a burst of energy.

With a bang, the tightly shut door swung open.

“Ah!” Dong Qingyan, who had been eavesdropping, stumbled in unexpectedly and fell to the ground.

“What are you sneaking around for?” Yang Kai glared at her.

Dong Qingyan quickly got up from the floor, brushing off the dust from her clothes, and grinned as she curiously sized up Xia Ningshang.

“Who is this?” Xia Ningshang asked, rising gracefully, puzzled.

“My cousin… the young lady of the Dong Family,” Yang Kai replied softly.

“The Dong Family? Wasn’t there a Dong Family that visited Lingxiao Pavilion last time…”

“That’s the Dong Family; the last time they visited Lingxiao Pavilion was her brother.”

“Oh, so you’re Miss Dong.”

“Don’t be so polite, just treat me as one of you…” Dong Qingyan didn’t regard herself as an outsider at all. She moved closer to Xia Ningshang, examining her closely, making Xia Ningshang blush, before smiling and saying, “You’re… Sister-in-law, right?”

Xia Ningshang was taken aback, her heart in turmoil. She secretly glanced at Yang Kai and quickly waved her hands: “N-no, it’s not like that; your sister-in-law… is someone else…”

“I think it’s only a matter of time,” Dong Qingyan said, nodding sagely, her tone certain.

Straightening up, she pretended to cough lightly, then moved to the side and brought over a chair. She sat down in front of Xia Ningshang and Yang Kai, her big, sparkling eyes wide open as she grinned: “Just pretend I’m not here, and do whatever you want!”

The little girl was also experiencing the stirrings of first love and was quite curious about romance. Now that she had caught a pair of golden boys and jade girls, she naturally wanted to study them closely.

Xia Ningshang, flustered, said, “Master is calling me; I have to go.”

Saying this, she hurriedly left.

Dong Qingyan was stunned, disappointment written all over her face, frowning: “It shouldn’t be like this!”

“Then how do you think it should be?” Yang Kai looked at her oddly.

“You two haven’t seen each other for a long time; shouldn’t it be… filled with affection, sweet words, and then thunder and lightning… and then…”

As she spoke, Dong Qingyan also found it hard to bear, her face turning red with embarrassment.

Yang Kai sighed softly: “It should have been like that, but now that you’re here, it’s not going to be like that anymore, understand?”

Dong Qingyan trembled slightly, instantly feeling guilty, and regretfully said: “Cousin, I was wrong. Next time you’re together, I won’t interrupt you again.”

“Good, knowing your mistake is enough. Now go!” Yang Kai nodded indifferently.

“Okay.”

In another room, Meng Wuya and Xiao Fusheng were drinking together.

After several cups of tea, Meng Wuya chuckled and said, “Elder Xiao, you should know the purpose of my visit this time, right?”

Xiao Fusheng smiled, setting down his teacup, and nodded: “I naturally know; it’s my duty to teach you alchemy. But there’s another matter…”

“What is it? Is it inconvenient?”

“It’s not that it’s inconvenient, but I’m not sure if your disciple has the qualifications! If she doesn’t, then opening Wan Yao Pool would be a wasted effort; it’s quite costly to open Wan Yao Pool even once.”

Hearing this, Meng Wuya laughed heartily: “How could my disciple lack qualifications? If she can’t do it, then no one in the world can!”

“Are you that confident?” Xiao Fusheng frowned.

Meng Wuya smiled slightly: “It’s not confidence; it’s faith in her. If you don’t believe me, you can test her right now!”

Xiao Fusheng’s expression changed, and he said solemnly: “Good! I’m a bit impatient now.”

“Disciple!” Meng Wuya called out loudly.

“Here!” Xia Ningshang quickly responded.

“Elder Xiao wants to test your alchemy skills; perform well and don’t let him down,” Meng Wuya said with a mischievous grin.

“Understood!”
