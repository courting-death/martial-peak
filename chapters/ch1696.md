## Chapter 1696 — Haijiao City

After becoming the Star Lord, there were surely many other benefits as well, though Yang Kai had yet to carefully explore or comprehend them, so for the moment, he wasn’t entirely sure.

Still, that single advantage alone was more than enough — wherever he passed, the Corpse Spirits could find no escape. With just a casual slap of his palm, entire groups of them were wiped out.

Now that he was the ruler of Dark Star, within this domain of his, who could possibly resist his might? Not even Qian Tong.

In just half a day Yang Kai traversed more than half of Dark Star, exterminating every Corpse Spirit he could sense.

Before those human warriors even understood what had happened, Yang Kai had already drifted away, leaving them staring at one another in bewilderment.

At the shores of Wuyou Sea, a group of human cultivators who had broken away from the main army were fleeing in panic, with more than a dozen Corpse Spirits with ferocious faces in relentless pursuit behind them.

The Corpse Spirit Race had not been faring well over the past year. Their powerful Corpse Generals were hunted down one after another by Qian Tong and the experts of Lingxiao Sect, and it was rumored that even their Sect Master had been slain. Leaderless, they were steadily suppressed by the united human forces and driven back step by step toward Wuyou Sea, hoping to flee into the boundless ocean in search of a slim chance at survival.

But their plan did not succeed—Qian Tong and Ye Xijun hunted the Corpse Spirit Sect all the way here and had already blocked their retreat, making it impossible for them to get deep into the Wuyou Sea.

The Corpse Spirit Sect was now on the decline, no longer the mighty force it was years ago.

Pressed to the brink, the Corpse Spirit Race could only seek out isolated human warriors to kill, venting their frustration and resentment.

This unlucky band of seven or eight human warriors had run into a force superior in both number and strength; in one engagement they lost several members and were forced to flee toward the main army. Leading them was a woman with a peach-blossom face, alluring looks and a lithe figure; her breasts surged fiercely as she ran, but under pursuit by the Corpse Spirit Race her features drained of color. As she fled she continuously poured Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass on her hand, hoping to summon her elders to come to her rescue.

Another scream came from behind; the woman turned and saw a scene that made her whole body tremble.

A lagging comrade had been overtaken by several members of the Corpse Spirit Race and knocked to the ground. The cruel creatures did not immediately kill him; instead they swarmed over him, using their sharp fangs to gnaw at his flesh.

The screams and cries for help from her companions made the woman’s legs tremble uncontrollably. A surge of heat rushed through her lower abdomen — she almost lost control right there on the spot.

In just a short while, her companion’s cries grew weaker and weaker. After feasting on their fill, the Corpse Spirits grew even more savage, closing in on her with frightening speed.

The thought that her own tender flesh might soon end up as food for the Corpse Spirits, and that she too would become a pile of hideous, lifeless bones like her companion, filled the woman’s beautiful eyes with terror and helpless despair.

Overwhelming fear made her steps as heavy as if filled with lead; her Saint Yuan would not circulate properly, and she found herself unable to move.

The Corpse Spirit Race behind her drew ever closer; she could even smell the thick stench of blood.

The woman cried out.

At that moment the world blurred and a figure suddenly appeared, reaching out a hand; with a light grab he plucked her from midair and pulled her behind him. The young man then snapped his fingers in quick succession; accompanied by several gusts of force, every one of the more than a dozen pursuing Corpse Spirit Race without exception exploded into pulp.

The disaster was dissolved in an instant.

The woman stared blankly at the figure before her, a sense of having survived a catastrophe welling up from her heart, and cried out, "Yang Kai?"

Her voice still trembled and her face was pale; she clearly had not yet recovered from the shock and excitement.

Hearing the woman's address, the other human warriors were momentarily stunned, then all looked at Yang Kai with uplifted, grateful eyes.

Of course they had heard Yang Kai's great name, but very few had actually seen him; that the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect personally came to their rescue left them overflowing with gratitude.

"Yin Sudie?" Yang Kai glanced back at the woman and frowned. "What are you doing here? Where is your master?"

The young woman was none other than Yin Sudie of Liuli Sect.

Within Liuli Sect she was counted among the outstanding young talents; her Charm Technique was rarely resisted, but against the Corpse Spirit Race her charms were useless, and at her First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm the strength she could display was greatly reduced.

Otherwise she would not have been in such an embarrassing state.

Yin Sudie forced a smile and obediently replied, "My master is in Haijiao City!"

Yang Kai released Divine Sense to probe and quickly detected a concentration of warrior auras in a city tens of thousands of li away; that must be Haijiao City, a city close to the shore of the Wuyou Sea.

"Why did you run out instead of staying by your master's side?" Yang Kai asked, somewhat displeased.

Although the humans had largely prevailed and the Corpse Spirit Race had almost no foothold left, acting alone was still very dangerous, especially in the borderlands near the Wuyou Sea.

Yang Kai did not particularly like Yin Sudie, but she was now a disciple of Lingxiao Sect; as Sect Master he could admonish her.

Yin Sudie immediately became meek and could not speak.

Back when Yang Kai's fame had not yet risen, she had even once moved against him, but times had changed. Yin Sudie knew better than anyone the immeasurable gap between them—if Yang Kai stood atop the clouds, she could only remain on the ground and look up.

She had countless times envied that homely Senior Sister Daiyuan, wondering what means she had used to gain Yang Kai's favor.

Because of Yang Kai's attitude, her master Gong Aofu had come to favor Senior Sister more and had gradually neglected Yin Sudie over the past year or so.

"Forget it." Yang Kai waved his hand, not wanting to probe further, and turned to size up the other warriors, finding them all to be youths.

These fellows had clearly been infatuated by Yin Sudie's charms and gladly ran about after her like attendants.

Yang Kai was well aware of Yin Sudie's methods; he even noticed that a few of the men, when they glanced at him, did so with resentment and vigilance.

"I'm sending you back to Elder Gong," Yang Kai said, waving his hand and wrapping Yin Sudie in a band of Saint Yuan.

To Yang Kai's surprise, Yin Sudie promptly slid into his arms, both hands clasping his waist in a dependent manner; her pair of surging breasts pressed unabashedly against his chest, all softness.

Yang Kai shook his head but did not immediately push her away; taking advantage of the movement he swept the other warriors up as well, and with a flick of his figure they arrived directly in Haijiao City.

He lightly patted Yin Sudie's shoulder and said, "We're here."

Having said that, he vanished once more, disregarding whatever she might have thought.

Yin Sudie uttered an 'ah' and looked around in surprise—she had indeed returned to Haijiao City; the city's buildings were so familiar.

Her hands still held the posture of an empty embrace, and Yin Sudie felt somewhat wistful.

Haijiao City was not large and was now packed with human warriors. Yang Kai found Ye Xijun, Qian Tong, and others in the city and, after a long talk, learned of the recent developments.

Yang Kai had thought refining the Stellar Origin wouldn’t take long, but to his surprise, more than a full year had passed.

During that year Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall joined forces and had basically uprooted the Corpse Spirit Sect's power. The remaining Corpse Spirit Race tried to flee into the Wuyou Sea but were blocked and were forced to hide in a mountain range thirty thousand li from Haijiao City, refusing to emerge.

Qian Tong would go and kill a batch every now and then, but some of the Corpse Spirit Race hid too deeply; even Qian Tong could not find them all—an ongoing headache.

The whole of Dark Star had basically returned to calm; roughly eighty percent or more of the remaining Corpse Spirit Race were hiding in that mountain range. Once those Corpse Spirit Race were driven to extinction the remnants would be negligible, and then without the need for Lingxiao Sect or Yingyue Hall to step in, each sect could by its own strength wipe out the scattered remnants.

"Is that so..." After inquiring into the situation Yang Kai grinned, "I'll go pay them a visit."

"You have a way?" Qian Tong looked at him in astonishment. This meeting left Qian Tong with the sense that Yang Kai had changed somewhat—he could not pinpoint where. By his perception Yang Kai was still Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; his aura had grown more massive, yet it gave off an extremely dangerous feeling.

It was as if, should he spar with Yang Kai, he would inevitably be the one to die.

That thought filled Qian Tong with doubt; he could not unravel the cause.

"You'll see when the time comes." Yang Kai smiled faintly, not speaking too boastfully.

"I'll go with you," Qian Tong said in a low voice.

Yang Kai nodded, rose to his feet, and suddenly instructed Ye Xijun, "Have the people gathered in Haijiao City disperse. After years of upheaval their sects need time to recuperate; staying here would be a waste."

Ye Xijun paused for a moment but quickly nodded in agreement.

Yang Kai reached out and took hold of Qian Tong's arm; the next moment the two of them vanished strangely from right under Ye Xijun's nose—powerful as she was, she could detect no trace.

Ye Xijun's expression flickered; she then pursed her lips and smiled, an enlightened look on her face as she said, "So that's it!"

She clearly understood something.

After a moment's consideration she took out a Transmission Compass, poured Divine Sense into it, and issued the order.

Before long the human warriors gathered in Haijiao City received directives from Lingxiao Sect: the Corpse Spirit Race have been annihilated—each sect return to their main hall and recuperate!

The warriors of the various large and small sects looked at one another and ran about in inquiry, but in the end the result matched the directive: high-ranking figures from Yingyue Hall and Lingxiao Sect both confirmed it.

Though none knew why the Corpse Spirit Race had suddenly been wiped out, the catastrophe that had engulfed Dark Star was finally over. The human cultivators were overjoyed, and, trusting in Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall, they all returned to their respective sects, discussing how best to rebuild and rise again.
