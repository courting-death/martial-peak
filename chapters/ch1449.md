## Chapter 1449 — Exterminate to the Last

The old man in the black robe was already at the end of his rope; even knowing the Golden Blood Threads were a deadly attack, he couldn’t move in time to dodge, nor did he have the strength to resist. In his haste he could only circulate Saint Yuan to shield himself, hoping to survive the blow.

With a faint tearing sound, the Saint Yuan barrier he had set up proved as fragile as paper before the razor-sharp Golden Blood Threads. It offered no resistance at all—the threads pierced straight through it, and even his head was run clean through.

The old man’s lips twitched as he stared at Yang Kai in stunned disbelief, as if trying to say something, but he had no strength left, and the life in his eyes rapidly drained away.

By the time Yang Kai withdrew the Golden Blood Threads, the old man’s body crashed to the ground.

From the moment Yang Kai struck to the end of the fight, only the length of half a teacup’s time had passed; such a battle had already been decided, and in the end it was the stronger old man who fell.

The brevity of the encounter and the unexpected outcome left everyone present aghast.

Yang Kai himself was also surprised. Although with his current methods he had no fear of a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and was confident he could kill one, he had never unleashed his full power in this fight; he fought only with the Golden Blood Threads and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, finally using the Blooming Lotus secret technique just once.

It wasn’t that he wished to hide his skill, but rather that he saw no need to employ more methods.

That the other party fell so quickly owed greatly to the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit; had it not devoured the old man’s Qiantian Thunderfire and worsened his situation, Yang Kai could not have won so easily.

Although the other skirmishes were each being fought separately, everyone kept an eye on the nearby situation; the old man’s death naturally did not escape notice.

With the black-robed elder dead, Yang Kai had won with ease. The bald giant Kong Wendong’s face twisted with a mix of shock and fury, looking extremely grim, and even the leader of Ice Heart Valley, the young woman, revealed a trace of apprehension in her beautiful eyes.

She had thought Yang Kai’s strength was not great; although she had deliberately persuaded him to assist, she hadn’t taken him seriously, nor did she honor the terms they’d discussed. Who would have guessed this youth was so ruthlessly merciless and exceptionally powerful?

On the whole, however, the young woman was more pleased than alarmed — after all, Fire Radiance Sect had lost a man, giving her side the upper hand in the great clash.

With that thought, she called out sweetly to Yang Kai, “Young Brother, hurry and help my sisters!”

“Alright!” Yang Kai nodded nonchalantly, then turned his gaze to the Origin Returning Realm First Stage warrior who had been ambushed and grievously injured earlier.

The man was already badly wounded, overwhelmed by the Ice Heart Valley woman’s blows. He had no strength to fight back and was merely clinging to life; seeing the black-robed elder fall and Yang Kai staring at him with malicious intent, how could he not understand his prospects were bleak?

His mind was shaken to the core, his strength dropping sharply as a result. Faced with the ferocious assault of the Ice Heart Valley woman, he suddenly found himself unable to defend, exposing fatal openings instead—and could only think of fleeing for his life.

The Ice Heart Valley woman would not allow him to escape; she drove her Secret Treasure at him and struck his back, forcing him to spit out several mouthfuls of blood. He collapsed to the ground, his breaths shallow and scarce.

She was fair of feature and stunning to behold, yet knowing that a half-defeated snake still posed danger, she stepped forward to deliver a finishing blow and ended his life completely.

After winning, she exchanged a glance with Yang Kai, then joined the other side’s battle ring.

That skirmish involved two Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors who had been evenly matched, but with Yang Kai and the First Stage ally joining in, the situation immediately changed.

With three against one, the Fire Radiance Sect’s female warrior had no chance to flee; in less than thirty breaths she was slain by the two Ice Heart Valley women.

Yang Kai’s role had been largely to tie up the enemy, but it was no small contribution.

The battle shifted with startling speed, catching everyone off guard. Using Yang Kai as the breakthrough point, Ice Heart Valley quickly gained the upper hand. Of the four Fire Radiance Sect cultivators, only Kong Wendong now remained, still struggling against the beautiful young woman.

Seeing the situation hopeless, a vein of vicious hatred flashed in Kong Wendong’s eyes as he spat, “Wicked wench, one day you’ll pay for this!”

Saying this, he feinted and moved out of the young woman’s attack range. Flames flickered across his body, wrapping him, and with inconceivable speed he shot off into the distance.

No one knew what secret art he had employed.

The young woman had failed to notice in time and let him escape a few li, her face paling with anxiety.

She did not wish to let Kong Wendong escape; if he called for reinforcements, their affairs here could be complicated. She cried out urgently, “Stop him!”

Hearing her shout, the two other Ice Heart Valley women hurried in pursuit, but Yang Kai frowned and remained rooted to the spot.

Whether Kong Wendong lived or died was of no concern to him. Fire Radiance Sect’s origins were from some remote star and even if he got away he posed no threat to Yang Kai. What Yang Kai cared about were the treasures within this hidden cave. If he could break the cave’s seals and plunder the goods inside, he could leave at his leisure.

He had no interest in meddling in the feud between Fire Radiance Sect and Ice Heart Valley.

Seeing Yang Kai unmoved, the young woman grew anxious, her eyes darting as she said, “Kong Wendong also bears Qiantian Thunderfire; killing him would greatly benefit your spirit flame!”

Her quick thinking rekindled Yang Kai’s interest with a single sentence.

“Really?” Yang Kai eyed her suspiciously. He had thought Qiantian Thunderfire was some boon the black-robed elder had obtained, not something even Kong Wendong could possess.

“Would I deceive you? I can explain the specifics later, but Kong Wendong definitely has Qiantian Thunderfire!” Seeing Yang Kai’s stirred expression, the young woman immediately assured him.

“In that case he cannot be allowed to escape!” A glint flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes, and in the next instant his figure vanished from where he stood.

When he reappeared, he was already several li away.

The young woman’s eyes narrowed; her apprehension deepened. At her cultivation she should have been able to discern Yang Kai’s method of movement, yet she could not see through what he had done.

It was no wonder—Yang Kai’s mastery of Spatial Force was rare and obscure; few cultivated it and it was difficult to comprehend. Only someone like Mo Xiaosheng, a great elder of the Battle Sky Alliance, could perceive Yang Kai’s traces and identity.

Only those like Mo Xiaosheng who also cultivated Spatial Force could vaguely grasp some of its traces.

By slightly employing Spatial Force, Yang Kai could travel great distances with incredible speed. Although not the same as tearing space, it was still extraordinary and, most importantly, covert; it would not reveal his mastery of Spatial Force outright, unlike ripping space which was too conspicuous.

Kong Wendong’s speed was considerable, but no matter how fast he ran, he could not outrun Yang Kai’s space-crossing movement.

Within a dozen breaths Yang Kai had intercepted him, snapping his fingers and releasing lines of Demonic Flame that transformed into little birds and flew toward him.

“Get lost, brat!” Kong Wendong roared in fury. He stood his ground, refusing to dodge. The Secret Treasure in his hand, shaped like a great blade, was imbued with Saint Yuan and hummed as he swung it down toward Yang Kai.

A gigantic blade of light, tens of zhang long, shot out from the Secret Treasure in a crescent shape with terrifying momentum.

The Demonic Flame birds were instantly cut to pieces and sent flying. Facing such a strike, Yang Kai could not be careless. Without hesitation he summoned his Purple Shield, which transformed into a sandstorm to guard him.

A tremendous noise erupted; dust and sand scattered as the blade’s edge was dispersed. The sandstorm formed by the Purple Shield was rent open, narrowly revealing Yang Kai’s figure.

“An Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure?” Kong Wendong’s eyes narrowed and he exclaimed in surprise.

His eyesight was not poor; he immediately recognized the Purple Shield’s grade.

“Heaven’s sins may yet be forgiven, but one’s own sins spell certain death! Kong Wendong, this place shall be your grave today!” From afar came a clear, ringing cry — it was the Ice Heart Valley young woman who had pursued Kong Wendong all the way here.

Though slower than Yang Kai, Kong Wendong had not fled far before Yang Kai intercepted him. The young woman rejoiced and, with a clear cry, produced the Void King-Grade Secret Treasure, the Profound Yin Heart-Crushing Drum, and before she even reached him her jade hand had lightly tapped the drumhead.

A faint drumming spread from all directions, eerie and strange. Though soft, the sound stirred Qi and blood to turmoil in anyone who heard it, producing unbearable discomfort.

But that was not all; the young woman continued to beat the drum, her movements slow and strained as if expending great effort. Each beat made her complexion paler, while the drum’s sound grew ever louder until it was deafening, seeming to blast right into one’s ears, leaving no means of defense.

The drum’s sound not only enveloped Kong Wendong but spared not even Yang Kai.

As the drumbeat entered his ears, Yang Kai’s eyes grew bloodshot and his face flushed; the blood in his body surged toward his head. Sensing this, he cast a cold gaze at the young woman.

Even from hundreds of zhang away that chilling stare made the young woman’s body tremble and involuntarily halt her movements. The next moment, when she struck the drum again, the sound near Yang Kai weakened greatly and no longer affected him.

But Kong Wendong standing before Yang Kai bore much greater pressure. The Void King-Grade Secret Treasure’s power was unfathomable; though the young woman had not fully refined it and could only exert half its strength, Kong Wendong still found it extremely difficult to resist.

Unknowingly, blood flowed from his seven orifices, his expression contorted in agony, his hulking body trembling violently as he endured tremendous pain.

With the young woman and her Profound Yin Heart-Crushing Drum restraining Kong Wendong, Yang Kai struck without hesitation; golden threads enveloped Kong Wendong, and hidden within the Demonic Flame the Space Blade shot forth to pelt him.
