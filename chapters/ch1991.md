## Chapter 1991 — Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda

After listening to Shopkeeper Kang's explanation, Yang Kai finally understood how matters had come to be.

The Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda was the supreme treasure of the Star God Palace, and it had earned great renown throughout the Star Realm.

That was not merely because it was an Imperial Treasure, but because it was extraordinarily special. The interior of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda formed its own world, somewhat like the Xuan Realm Pearl, only more complete than the Xuan Realm Pearl in Yang Kai's possession.

Rumor held that the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda had been created by the Lord of the Star God Palace, the Radiant Moon Great Emperor, but in truth the Pagoda had already possessed a rudimentary form before the Radiant Moon Great Emperor rose to fame.

It was only later that the Radiant Moon Great Emperor obtained it, refining and improving it into its final shape.

The space inside the Pagoda was said to be an ancient battlefield, where many ancient treasures and spiritual herbs remained; the battlefield's terrain was treacherous and ever-changing, and because it was kept within the Star God Palace it was the disciples' favorite and most accessible place for trial and training.

Star God Palace disciples who met certain requirements could enter the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda to undergo trials.

There they honed their cultivation, improved their combat skills, and comprehended the subtleties of the Martial Dao and Domain laws.

Although the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda had existed for countless years and countless warriors had entered it seeking opportunities, the treasures inside had never diminished.

The reason was simple: entry was not without risk. Many Star God Palace disciples had perished within, and the Spatial Rings they carried naturally became remnants inside the Pagoda, targets for the next entrants.

The entire Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda was divided into five levels: the first and second levels were suitable for Void King Realm warriors to train in; the third and fourth stages were for Dao Origin Realm warriors; and the highest, the fifth stage, was where Emperor Realm warriors trained to pursue the Dao.

Inside the Pagoda there were not only hidden secret treasures and spiritual herbs that had grown for countless years, but what most excited cultivators were the occasional, fleeting forces of the Power of the Laws and fragments of the Stellar Origin.

That was because it was a shattered ancient battlefield. In ancient times countless powerful figures had fought there, tearing the heavens and fracturing the stars; laws had been broken, so inside the Pagoda there remained many broken Powers of the Laws and incomplete fragments of the Stellar Origin.

Neither of these were whole, yet within them many mysteries and wonders were nurtured; if a cultivator obtained and comprehended them, they would be of tremendous use to anyone.

In cultivation, after the Void King Realm came the Dao Origin Realm, where one began to comprehend the laws. Dao Origin Realm warriors could only simply apply the laws; truly turning the laws into one's own so that words were followed by law was an arcane secret only Emperor Realm experts could touch.

In the Star Realm countless Void King Realm warriors had fully transformed their Origin Qi yet still could not ascend to the Dao Origin Realm; the greatest shackling point was the inability to perceive the Power of the Laws.

It was for this reason that warriors who possessed the body of a Star Lord were welcomed in the Star Realm.

Yang Kai, for example, had already, back in the Origin Returning Realm, initially felt the laws of the Dark Star; although that was only the law of a single Cultivation Star and could not be compared to the laws of an entire heaven and earth, one law opening the way to all laws meant Yang Kai had at least glimpsed the gate. In the future he would not face too great a bottleneck when ascending to the Dao Origin Realm, and he might even enjoy a natural advantage when advancing to the Emperor Realm.

But that welcome wasn't purely the admiration or eager expectation of the powerful — it was more often laced with jealousy and a hunger to plunder. Yin Lesheng of the Netherworld Sect was the best example of this.

Therefore Yang Kai would not expose the secret of his Star Lord identity.

"So then, Master Yang, you should understand how beneficial opening the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda would be for people like us, right?" Shopkeeper Kang asked, his face shining.

"I understand. If that's truly the case, then the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda would indeed be an excellent place to go," Yang Kai said.

"And that's not all," Shopkeeper Kang smiled. "You know how Fenglin City is crawling with trouble this time; countless forces, big and small, have come, so after the Star Envoy decided to open the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, those top powers dared not fail to show face."

"Shopkeeper Kang means..." Yang Kai trembled all over and suddenly thought of a possibility.

"Heh heh heh... to be frank with you, Master Yang, powers such as Tianwu Sacred Land, Wuhua Hall, Qingyang Shrine and others have each put a batch of precious supplies into the Pagoda's space," Shopkeeper Kang said with a grin. "Inside there are not only spiritual pills and secret techniques, but even Dao Origin-Grade secret treasures!"

Yang Kai's eyes immediately lit up.

If that were true, the whole of Fenglin City would probably erupt.

In the past it had been nearly impossible for ordinary cultivators or those of low birth to obtain favors from the great powers, but with such a windfall—so many treasures hidden inside the Pagoda waiting for the fated—countless cultivators would surely flock to it.

"Tianwu Sacred Land even put in three Dao Origin Fruits!" Shopkeeper Kang's expression suddenly grew ecstatic, his voice trembling. "Master Yang, as an alchemist you know the value of Dao Origin Fruits better than anyone."

"The Dao Origin Fruit used to refine Dao Origin Pills?" Yang Kai cried out.

"Exactly!" Shopkeeper Kang could not contain the shaking of his hands; the tea cup he held spilled. "Dao Origin Fruits—throughout the Star Realm only a handful of top powers can cultivate them, and in the Southern Territory not even the Star God Palace has a Dao Origin Fruit tree. Tianwu Sacred Land is unique; every ten years only six Dao Origin Fruits are produced, and now they put out three at once—Tianwu Sacred Land is truly bleeding out this time."

"Shopkeeper Kang wants those Dao Origin Fruits?" Yang Kai guessed when he saw Kang's changed expression.

"Of course I want them!" Shopkeeper Kang said with a bitter laugh. "I have been stuck at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm for more than two hundred years. I know my aptitude is not high. If nothing extraordinary happens, this life of mine will probably stop short of the Dao Origin Realm. But if I truly obtained a Dao Origin Fruit... I could try to crack the bottleneck. Whether I succeed or not, there would at least be a slim chance!"

Although Shopkeeper Kang was the owner of the Spiritual Pill workshop and nominally part of the Commerce Guild, his strength was not high, so his status within the Commerce Guild was low; he therefore had no channels through the Guild to obtain Dao Origin Pills.

A single Dao Origin Pill could potentially create a Dao Origin Realm warrior, and the Commerce Guild would not casually bestow such things upon its subordinates; one had to have corresponding merits.

If Shopkeeper Kang lingered in Fenglin City for another one or two hundred years and produced certain results in that time, perhaps then he might be granted a Dao Origin Pill.

Yang Kai could to some degree understand Shopkeeper Kang's excitement.

A single Dao Origin Fruit could be used to refine an entire furnace of pills, and a full furnace of Dao Origin Pills could yield up to nine. So if he could get hold of a Dao Origin Fruit, no matter who refined it for him he would be guaranteed at least one or two Dao Origin Pills.

Once he rose to the Dao Origin Realm his status in the Commerce Guild would be completely different, and he would not be forced to remain in a small place like Fenglin City.

Putting Shopkeeper Kang's desires aside, Yang Kai himself also had need of Dao Origin Pills.

Once his Origin Qi had fully transformed and he had a glimpse of the laws' secrets, he would have the qualification to ascend to the Dao Origin Realm; Dao Origin Pills would greatly increase his chance of a successful breakthrough.

"Master Yang, you won't pass up a trip to the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, will you?" Shopkeeper Kang asked, calming his expression as he looked at Yang Kai.

"Such a grand event, of course I'll go see the commotion," Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"That's good, that's good," Shopkeeper Kang laughed. "Miss this chance and you may never have another opportunity to enter the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda in your lifetime."

"But Shopkeeper Kang... if that's true then this trial will be extremely dangerous. You and I are both at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; facing Void King Realm enemies is not so worrying, but if we encounter Dao Origin Realm experts..." Yang Kai warned.

"Heh, Master Yang is being cautious," Shopkeeper Kang smiled and waved his hand. "Opening the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda is not that easy. The Star Envoy has graciously allowed Fenglin City's cultivators to enter, but he will not open the entire Pagoda. This time only the first and second levels will be opened, so only Void King Realm and below may enter; there will be no Dao Origin Realm warriors inside."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai was stunned.

But on second thought he could understand.

After all, the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda was an Imperial Treasure, and opening it consumed a great deal. Even if the Star Envoy was powerful, he could not possibly open it all at once.

Otherwise the Star God Palace would suffer great loss.

For Yang Kai, however, that news was welcome.

As long as there were no Dao Origin Realm warriors there was nothing for him to fear; he only had to be careful of the Pagoda's own dangers.

"Exactly. I hurried to summon you to tell you this; the news hasn't been officially announced—only those who followed the Star Envoy into Yuqing Mountain know, and I heard it from the city lord. Since you know now, please prepare early," Shopkeeper Kang said.

"Thanks for the reminder, Shopkeeper Kang," Yang Kai said gratefully.

"You're welcome. Without you the Spiritual Pill workshop's future would be bleak; this is my small repayment, don't mention it," Shopkeeper Kang replied.

"In that case, I'll take my leave. I really must go back and make preparations," Yang Kai rose to leave.

"See you in three days," Shopkeeper Kang said, slightly bowing.

Yang Kai nodded and soon left the Spiritual Pill workshop.

Back at his abode he took out the medicinal materials he had previously gathered from the Small Xuan Realm garden and immediately set about refining Spiritual Pills.

Although only Void King Realm and below could enter, Yang Kai was not overly worried about encountering excessively powerful foes, but Spiritual Pills were always useful to have in abundance; should anything happen, they could save the day.

He had a considerable supply of ingredients, and he refined them furnace by furnace with single-minded focus.
