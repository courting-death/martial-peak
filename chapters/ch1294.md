## Chapter 1294 — Array Within an Array

In an instant, dense Corpse Qi surged forth, wrapping around the golden thread—but to the Corpse Soldier’s horror, his ever-invincible Corpse Qi had no effect at all. That golden thread seemed almost alive; it gave a faint tremor, and from within burst forth a surge of astonishing vitality and Qi and blood, instantly scattering the Corpse Qi. In the next moment, the golden thread shot toward his chest—his body, once extraordinarily tough, crumbled like tofu, pierced clean through by the golden silk.

The golden threads coiled a few times and bound him tightly.

The Corpse Soldier was terrified, but before he could make any other move, Yang Kai fired off a pitch-black blade-like attack; that strike gave off no energy fluctuations, yet the jade-green ghost-fire in the Corpse Soldier's eyes flickered wildly—he sensed enormous danger from that attack.

In a rush he twisted his body and barely avoided the vital spot, letting that pitch-black, blade-like attack slice across one of his arms.

An exceedingly bizarre scene unfolded—without a sound, his arm suddenly fell from his body. What was even stranger, the cross-section where it had been severed was missing a portion of flesh, making it impossible for the wound to align with his own body.

The ability to accomplish this naturally came from Yang Kai’s Space Blade.

Although the Corpse Soldier's flesh was incredibly tough, the Space Blade was likewise immeasurably powerful; by severing the void it could swallow part of the opponent's arm into the depths of the void and banish it there forever.

Yet when Yang Kai looked over, only a faint greenish fluid seeped from the wound—no trace of blood at all—an exceedingly strange sight.

Nevertheless, the Corpse Soldier seemed as if he had sustained some grievous injury. He let out a mournful howl, and his whole body was soon wrapped in thick Corpse Qi.

Yang Kai intended to finish him off, but his expression suddenly changed; he hastily waved his hand, and the golden thread that bound the Corpse Soldier flew back at his command.

In an instant the Corpse Soldier regained freedom; shrouded in Corpse Qi, he glared viciously at Yang Kai, then snatched up the fallen severed arm from the ground, transformed into a beam of yellow light, and fled at astonishing speed.

Yang Kai stood with a sullen expression. Lowering his head to inspect his golden threads, he found them stained with a considerable amount of black energy.

He had not practiced the Golden Silk Technique for long and could not yet unleash its full power, otherwise this would not have happened. If the Corpse Soldier had been bound thoroughly, no matter how strong he was, Yang Kai could have dealt with him in short order.

With a flick of his hand Yang Kai withdrew the golden silk into his body and stirred his Saint Yuan, purging the Corpse Qi from the threads. He then grabbed Yang Yan's shoulder and, like a streak of wind, pursued the fleeing Corpse Soldier.

The skirmish between Yang Kai and the Corpse Soldier was over in a flash; Yang Yan hadn't even reacted before the Corpse Soldier she regarded as a great enemy had fled in disarray. Only then did she remember something and begin explaining the origin of Corpse Soldiers to Yang Kai.

From her explanation Yang Kai came to understand that "Corpse Soldier" was merely a designation—a rank for this kind of being.

Just as Yin-Souls can be born, these Corpse Soldiers arise only when yin-qi is extremely dense. When beings die here, by some chance the spirit and the body do not perish but instead become another form of existence—these are the Corpse Soldiers.

Of course, some Corpse Soldiers are not formed this way; they are Yin-Souls that, having cultivated to maturity, forcibly occupied other bodies, transforming into Corpse Soldiers through a process akin to usurpation.

Even more are the Corpse Soldiers artificially created by secret arts; on Dark Star, many evil sects possess such forbidden techniques.

Overall, forming a Corpse Soldier is far more difficult than birthing a Yin-Soul. A Yin-Soul needs only suitable conditions and an intact spirit to take shape, but a Corpse Soldier requires both spirit and flesh to exist and to fuse, making it much harder.

These beings can be divided into three major ranks: hundred-year Corpse Soldiers, Thousand-Year Corpse Generals, and Ten-Thousand-Year Corpse Kings!

Hundred-year Corpse Soldiers need no explanation—their cultivation is exceedingly arduous, for as dead things their bodies do not readily absorb the world's Yuan Qi like the living. Thus their cultivation progresses far slower than any living creature; a Corpse Soldier cultivated for hundreds of years might still fall short of a Saint King Realm warrior.

Even within the Corpse Soldier ranks the strength varies greatly, from the negligible Open Origin Realm to the formidable Saint King Realm.

The one Yang Kai encountered just now was a peak Saint King Realm existence, likely cultivated at least seven or eight hundred years to reach such a state.

Once a Corpse Soldier advanced to the level of a Thousand-Year Corpse General, it would possess strength no less than that of an Origin Returning Realm expert. As for the legendary Ten-Thousand-Year Corpse King, it was said to have the power to contend with a Void King Realm master — perhaps even surpass one. A Corpse King that had cultivated for ten thousand years could be said to possess an almost indestructible body. Yang Yan's account was detailed, and Yang Kai listened with mounting alarm.

He had never encountered such creatures before, nor had he heard anyone speak of them—he had not imagined such bizarre things existed in the world.

But Yang Kai was no ordinary man; having witnessed many strange beings before, he showed only mild interest in the Ten-Thousand-Year Corpse King's indestructible body and did not display excessive astonishment.

They pursued him all the way, but somehow the Corpse Soldier employed some strange method and suddenly vanished in a certain area some fifty li away.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense but could detect no trace; however, the faint Corpse Qi radiating from the Corpse Soldier's body still left a trail.

Following the trail of Corpse Qi, Yang Kai and Yang Yan arrived before a collapsed ruin. Looking around, they saw that within a radius of several dozen li, everything was reduced to broken walls and shattered foundations. This place must once have been one of the sect’s core areas — otherwise, there would not have been so many buildings.

"There are traces of an array," Yang Yan said, her beautiful eyes fixed on a plaza-like area, a smile playing at her lips. "But it's only an illusion array; breaking it isn't difficult."

Yang Kai nodded lightly, motioning her to go forward and dismantle it.

Yang Yan once more produced those strange tools, poured in Saint Yuan, tossed them into the void, and they disappeared.

In less than the time it takes a stick of incense to burn, the scene before them trembled and shifted, and in a tremendous upheaval the plaza vanished, replaced by another stretch of ruins.

Before Yang Yan could relax, wondrous energy strikes suddenly shot out from all directions, a sky-darkening barrage bearing down on where Yang Kai and Yang Yan stood with terrifying momentum.

"An array within an array!" Yang Yan cried out. Yang Kai reacted swiftly, yanking her behind him as he summoned his purple shield and poured Saint Yuan into it, unleashing the shield's stored power. Instantly, wind and sand rose—a cloud of yellow dust formed from nothing and wrapped around them.

It was the sandstorm power contained within the Purple Shield.

The energy strikes slammed into the sandstorm and were impeded by the wind and yellow sand; though not wholly dispelled, their power was greatly reduced and they no longer bore the same ferocity.

Yang Kai waved his hands and sent forth clusters of black fireballs, intercepting the remaining energy strikes.

Seeing this, Yang Yan relaxed and hurriedly inspected their surroundings. She had not expected there to be an array within an array here; such a layout was excessively stringent and costly in materials, so even great sects seldom set one up.

That one appearing here greatly surprised her, and made her quietly more cautious.

The attacks from the second formation came in an unending barrage. Though they weren’t powerful enough to destroy heaven and earth, Yang Kai was already looking quite flustered after fending them off one after another. At this rate, before long he would have to resort to other means to defend himself.

At that moment Yang Yan suddenly pointed to half of an ancient bronze door collapsed on the ground and cried, "Hit that!"

Hearing this, Yang Kai did not hesitate in the slightest — a Space Blade swept out from his hand.

In an instant the Space Blade bisected the bronze door, and a buzzing sound issued from the surrounding void; all the attacks quickly fell silent.

After a moment, seeing that no further strikes came, Yang Kai retracted his Purple Shield and scanned the area with concentrated attention.

He had expected the Corpse Soldier who fled earlier to hide here, but there was nothing in sight, which puzzled him greatly.

"It makes no sense—this array was troublesome even for me to dismantle. Why did the Corpse Soldier vanish as soon as he entered? He can't be versed in arrays," Yang Yan frowned; clearly she couldn't fathom the reason.

Yang Kai fell into thought, then suddenly said, "What if he already knew the safe routes in and out of this array?"

"Impossible," Yang Yan shook her head decisively. "Unless he was a Formation Master in life, no matter how strong he is, he couldn't do this. Of course, if he was once a disciple of this sect and knew the arrays here, that would explain it, but he's only a Corpse Soldier cultivated for a few hundred years. The Guyang Sect was annihilated two thousand years ago, so he couldn't have been a Guyang disciple in life."

"In any case, he's definitely still here," Yang Kai's mouth tugged into a smirk. "This place is so secluded and has an array within an array; don't you think it's very likely the place we're searching for?"

"You mean if we find his hiding place, our work is almost done?" Yang Yan suddenly brightened as she recalled something, her spirit lifted.

"Perhaps," Yang Kai said noncommittally.

The two exchanged a look and wasted no more time; they immediately began a careful search of the vicinity.

Half an hour later they stood above a ruin, staring intently at a spot below. It looked unremarkable at first glance, but on closer inspection there was a subtle distortion in space.

Another extremely concealed restriction—this one only served to obscure rather than attack. Had Yang Yan not studied arrays deeply she might never have found it.
