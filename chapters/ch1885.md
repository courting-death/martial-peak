## Chapter 1885 — It's You, You Little Bastard

The two Yao Lords acted the moment they decided to; Xue Jiao let out a low roar, and his already burly frame suddenly swelled, visible Qi and blood power billowing around his body like a red mist, surging like a tide.

He blurred forward, suddenly rocketing like a cannonball straight for the Half Moon Mountain barrier.

Yao were always strong in physical constitution, and the Lord of Blood Jiao had an extraordinary gift—born with a powerful body—so this single collision contained a destruction the likes of which was hard to imagine.

As he tore along his path, he left a streak of rainbow in his wake, the very air seeming to ignite.

Boom……

Xue Jiao's body slammed into the Half Moon Mountain barrier, and the entire Half Moon Mountain seemed to shake; the layer of protective light wrapped around it flashed wildly, as if on the verge of collapse.

Xue Jiao's face brightened with joy—he thought the Half Moon Mountain barrier was no great thing and prepared to redouble his strength to smash through it—when a fierce rebound force came from the other side, a counterblast even more violent than his initial impact.

Xue Jiao failed to notice at once; by the time he reacted it was already too late.

With a muffled groan, his hulking body was flung away.

The gathered yao looked at one another, eyes wide with horror.

Fortunately Xue Jiao's hide was thick and his flesh tough; though the rebound was powerful, it did him no real harm—only left him dirtied and disheveled. At the side, Qian Yan’s expression was grave. “It’s said that Half Moon Mountain was formed from half the body of an ancient Great Yao King. Naturally, it’s anything but ordinary.”

Xue Jiao shot him a displeased look. "Don't be smug, strike."

Qian Yan nodded without another word; sudden dazzling silver light exploded from his two silver eyes, condensing into substance and forming a pair of keen swords that shivered and then, like arrows loosed from a bow, stabbed toward the barrier with thunderous speed.

Seeing this, Xue Jiao did not idle either—cooperating with Qian Yan's secret art, he surged forward again, swinging his massive fists to smash at the Half Moon Mountain barrier.

The combined strike of the two Yao Lords was enough to annihilate heaven and earth.

As the attack landed, the Half Moon Mountain barrier's light flickered faster; this time Xue Jiao had been prepared and could not be flung away by the rebound force.

After the blow, the barrier's radiance seemed to dim slightly.

Seeing this, both Qian Yan and Xue Jiao's eyes flashed with sharp light; the two commanders naturally noticed the sign—if they struck with such ferocity a few more times, the barrier would surely break, and then they could drive straight in. They would storm Chi Yue's palace and, in no circumstance, allow Chi Yue to calmly absorb the power from the Void Mind Crystal of Yao King Feng E. All around, the many yao who had been fiercely assaulting the Half Moon Mountain barrier suddenly halted, fear creeping onto their faces.

Even Xue Jiao and Qian Yan grew grave, striving to dispel the unease in their hearts.

"Xue Jiao. Qian Yan, you and I are pillars among the yao—this Lord does not wish to drive this to an irreparable point. Leave now and this Lord will act as if nothing happened; otherwise, you will surely pay the price!"

"Chi Yue!" Xue Jiao and Qian Yan both breathed in unison.

As fellow Yao Lords they had dealt with one another before; they could tell Chi Yue's voice. But this time she sounded different—her words were not harsh, even measured, yet they struck a terrifying note, as if if things continued she could truly inflict an unimaginable price.

The two Yao Lords felt their hearts tighten and exchanged a glance.

Qian Yan grit his teeth. “Cut the theatrics. If you’ve got the guts, drop the barrier and let this Lord come in and speak with you face-to-face!”

"Indeed!" Xue Jiao echoed from the side. "Chi Yue, you know we are pillars among the yao. Today Qian Yan and I came here, yet you close your doors and refuse to see us—how is that fair? If you know your place, open the barrier and let us in!"

“Enough talk. Whether you live or die now rests on your own whim. I’ve shown all the mercy I owe.” Chi Yue’s voice drifted out from within Half Moon Mountain, and then silence fell.

Cold sweat beaded on the brows of Xue Jiao and Qian Yan; they sensed something amiss.

After a long moment Qian Yan turned to Xue Jiao and asked, "Brother Xue Jiao, you aren't afraid, are you?"

"I've never been afraid of anyone," Xue Jiao snorted.

"That is better," Qian Yan nodded slightly and smiled, "If so, then let's throw caution to the wind."

Xue Jiao frowned, hesitated for a breath, then gritted his teeth, "Very well!"

At that, the yao essence within both leaders surged forth again; each unleashed earth-shattering means and smashed toward the Half Moon Mountain barrier.

"Obstinate fools!" Chi Yue's angry voice rang out as the world's Spiritual Qi trembled; suddenly in the sky a colossal palmprint materialized.

The palmprint descended like the heavens collapsing, pressing down toward Xue Jiao and Qian Yan.

Both Yao Lords shrank instinctively, terror flashing across their faces as they looked up. Blood Jiao even cried out in shock, “Heaven and earth bend to her will… a Third-Stage Void King?”

Qian Yan was also taken aback; the reason they had dared act so boldly here was their numbers—everyone present was at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, so numbers gave them the advantage.

But if Chi Yue had truly advanced to Yao King and become a Third Stage of the Void King Realm powerhouse, numbers would mean nothing.

At that moment Qian Yan could not help but feel the urge to retreat—he only wanted to get away from Half Moon Mountain as far as possible.

But soon a light blossomed in Qian Yan's silver eyes and he shouted, "No—this is only a secret art. Xue Jiao, strike now!"

While urging Xue Jiao, he opened his mouth and roared; the audible sound waves surged toward the giant hand.

Xue Jiao, who had been listless and ashen-faced, was jolted by the reminder; his survival instinct flared, his strength erupted in madness, and fists after fist of colossal shadow flew upward.

Boom, boom, boom……

Punch-shadows, sound waves, and the palmprint collided; outside Half Moon Mountain, the world tore and reality shook, even the pervasive light seemed to be devoured.

Long after, the dust settled.

Qian Yan and Xue Jiao showed pleased expressions and exchanged a look, regaining confidence, while inside Half Moon Mountain there was no sign of movement.

"Chi Yue really hasn't advanced," Xue Jiao sneered low, sweeping away his earlier panic.

"But she will soon," Qian Yan said with worry. "Brother Xue Jiao, if we delay further and she succeeds, Di Chen Star will truly leave us with no foothold."

"I know," Xue Jiao's eyes flashed with ferocity as he nodded heavily.

"Then what are we waiting for—shatter this damned barrier at once; under no circumstances can we let her succeed!" Qian Yan bellowed.

Just as the two Yao Lords prepared to strike again, a figure suddenly appeared not far in front of them, standing in midair with a calm expression, looking at them indifferently.

"Who!" Xue Jiao roared.

"A human?" Qian Yan immediately saw through Yang Kai's identity; his brow tightened as his powerful Divine Sense swept over Yang Kai to probe his depth—then his face changed in surprise: "Second Stage of the Void King Realm!"

There could be absolutely no human Void King on Di Chen Star; even Origin Returning Realm experts were extremely rare, so the only explanation was that this person had come from another Cultivation Star.

Qian Yan was baffled that Yang Kai's stance suggested he might want to cause them trouble.

"This fellow looks somewhat familiar," Xue Jiao murmured, eyes wide as he stared at Yang Kai, unable to recall where he had seen him before.

Yang Kai grinned at the two Yao Lords, then spoke to Chi Yue inside Half Moon Mountain, "Senior, it looks like you've run into a bit of trouble!"

"It's you, you little bastard!" Chi Yue was equally shocked—she hadn't expected Yang Kai to appear outside Half Moon Mountain at such a moment.

"Huh? You have already reached the Second Stage of the Void King Realm—how is that possible?" a stronger voice of surprise came from within Half Moon Mountain; the world's Spiritual Qi seemed to shimmer with Chi Yue's shifting mood.

Yang Kai smiled slightly. "The world is vast and nothing is impossible. Don't let your mind waver and ruin your effort, Senior."

Chi Yue snapped, "Do I need you to remind me of such things?"

"Alright, it was impertinent of me," Yang Kai said sheepishly. "Senior, your little trouble at the gate—shall this Junior take care of it for you?"

"You're very confident," Chi Yue said in surprise. "How long has it been since you ascended to the Void King Realm?"

"Heh—two big Lords. I can't promise much, but I can at least protect myself."

“Oh?” Chi Yue was genuinely surprised, unable to fathom where Yang Kai found such confidence. After a brief silence, she said in a low voice, “I’m not in a position to act right now. If you truly have the ability, then go amuse yourself with them. We’re hardly strangers—helping me is only natural.”

"As you command!"

“Be careful. I don’t know what kind of miraculous pill you took to boost your strength so drastically in such a short time, but… the Void King Realm isn’t something that can be rushed. Don’t go and get yourself killed—I’ve no desire for Qingluo to blame me later.” Chi Yue clearly assumed Yang Kai’s rapid rise had to be due to some extraordinary spiritual medicine, and not an ordinary one at that.

"Thank you for your concern, Senior. I will do my best to survive," Yang Kai said solemnly.

While they spoke, Xue Jiao and Qian Yan remained silent, but as time passed both leaders burned with fury.

Yang Kai's air of dismissiveness towards them annoyed them greatly.

They were famed lords on Di Chen Star, among the top experts in the Star Domain—never had anyone treated them with such contempt.

Yang Kai had successfully provoked them.
