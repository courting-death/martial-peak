## Chapter 139 — Subduing the Earth Demon

One had to admit that the human face had somewhat overestimated Yang Kai.

The reason he had an inexhaustible supply of Yuan Qi was the result of his usual accumulation.

The True Yang Technique bore some resemblance to this mysterious martial skill, as both involved a process of accumulation. However, the accumulation of the True Yang Technique transformed all of one’s Yuan Qi into Yang Liquid, which was stored within the dantian. In contrast, the accumulation of this martial skill involved infusing Yuan Qi into the space beneath the star map, ready to erupt when needed.

There were also differences; the Yang Liquid stored within the dantian had no limits. One could say that as long as the conditions were right, Yang Kai could store as much as he desired.

But the space beneath the star map was different; it had its limitations.

After spending nearly two days converting the energy of ten drops of Yang Liquid into Yuan Qi and infusing it inside, he felt that this space had reached saturation.

During these two days, Yang Kai merely operated the True Yang Technique while healing his injuries, not deliberately focusing on the energy within the star map, and his Yuan Qi naturally drilled into that space.

This was a good thing; during regular cultivation, this martial skill would accumulate without needing him to specifically take time to handle it.

Two days later, Yang Kai opened his eyes and looked down at the back of his hand. The star map appeared much more vivid than at first; through this pattern, one could even see a three-dimensional image, as if a vast starry sky were truly sealed beneath his skin.

With a thought, the pattern on the back of his hand vanished, hidden beneath the flesh.

Yang Kai exhaled; the pattern was too dazzling. If it were to remain visible, it would surely raise suspicions.

After staring blankly for a moment, Yang Kai suddenly asked, “What is the name of the martial skill that resembles this in your memory?”

“Replying to the young hero, I do not remember,” the voice, once filled with fear, now carried a hint of obedience.

Yang Kai’s gaze flickered. He naturally did not know how much shock he had brought to the human face over the past two days. It was precisely because of this shock that the human face dared not underestimate Yang Kai any longer.

“I’ll give you a chance. Name it,” Yang Kai said. He had struggled to think of a name for the Flame Yang Explosion last time, and now that he had someone to assist him, he naturally tossed this question to the human face. This old demon must have lived a long time and seen much; naming it should be a simple task.

“Yes!” After a moment of silence, the voice continued, “Since there is a star map, and when it is displayed, the stars twinkle, shall we call it Mark of the Stars?”

“Mark of the Stars…” Yang Kai murmured a few times before nodding, “Not bad. We shall call it Mark of the Stars!”

The human face quickly responded respectfully, “Congratulations to the young hero for mastering the Mark of the Stars martial skill. From now on, you shall be both cultured and martial, benefiting the common people. In the future, you shall surely be invincible in battle!”

“Hmph!” Yang Kai remained unmoved.

The human face quickly fell silent, feeling that his flattery had hit the wrong mark.

“Have you thought of a way to save your life?” Yang Kai suddenly asked.

The human face trembled, “If the young hero spares my life, I am willing to offer you a secret treasure!”

Yang Kai glanced around and said indifferently, “If you have a secret treasure, it must be left here. I can kill you and still find it, so why should I spare you? To be honest, I have no interest in keeping someone like you alive, nor do I dare to do so, so refining you is the best method.”

The human face quickly replied, “Please spare my life, young hero! If you are not at ease, I can recognize you as my master. As long as a wisp of your divine soul imprint remains on me, my life and death will be in your hands. I earnestly request the young hero to show mercy and not refine me.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai seemed to be tempted and asked, “How do I know if what you say is true?”

The human face smiled bitterly, “Although I do not know what strange thing is within you, it is quite restraining to me. How could I dare to deceive you?”

Yang Kai fell silent. He did not particularly want to keep this demon alive, but he certainly knew some things about this place, and killing him would be a waste.

At least until he obtained the information he wanted, Yang Kai did not wish to kill him.

Yang Kai's silence made the human face even more anxious. He hurriedly said, “If the young hero spares my life, I can also unleash the effects of my secret treasure! You do not know; my secret treasure is indeed left here, but without me, even if you obtain it, you will not be able to use it.”

“Why is that?” Yang Kai asked.

“Because that secret treasure is inherently evil! Without my divine soul as a bridge, with the attribute of your Yuan Qi, you will not be able to control it alone,” the human face explained.

Yang Kai let out a long sigh and fell silent again, frowning in thought.

The human face knew that his life was at stake and dared not say much, lest he annoy Yang Kai further, but he could not help but feel anxious.

After a long while, Yang Kai suddenly asked, “What must I do for you to recognize me as your master?”

The human face's heart, which had been hanging in the air, finally relaxed. He trembled as he replied, “Please relax, young master. I will enter your mind and draw out a wisp of Divine Sense to imprint on myself!”

A cold smile appeared at the corner of Yang Kai's mouth.

The human face quickly explained, “Young master, your strength is still below the Divine Roaming Realm and cannot use your own Divine Sense. Please trust in my sincerity.”

“You may proceed!” Yang Kai said, relaxing.

The human face felt a surge of fear but was also impressed by Yang Kai's decisiveness. He thought to himself that if it were anyone else, they would likely be filled with hesitation at this moment, but Yang Kai acted without delay.

However, he truly did not need to worry. The last time he had rushed into Yang Kai's mind, he had been expelled by a force. If he tried to do so again, the human face believed that the same scene would occur.

Thus, he dared not have any improper thoughts and cautiously entered Yang Kai's mind, drawing out a wisp of Divine Sense and merging it with his own soul.

After a long time, the human face said, “Young master, it is done. From now on, my life and death will be entirely at your discretion.”

Yang Kai opened his eyes and felt that he indeed had a layer of connection with this human face, but this connection was one-sided; he had complete control over the other party.

“Your spirit seems to have recovered quite a bit?” Yang Kai asked meaningfully.

The human face replied, “Having merged with a wisp of the young master’s divine soul, it naturally has recovered. However, the young master need not worry; this wisp of divine soul can be retracted at any time, and it will not cause you any loss.”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, his thoughts moving.

The human face's screams immediately echoed, as if he had been thrown into a pot of boiling oil, his cries horrifyingly tragic.

“Spare me, young master! I speak nothing but the truth and have concealed nothing from you!” The human face repeatedly begged for mercy, his expression one of terror and agony as he rolled about within Yang Kai's body.

After tormenting him for a while, Yang Kai finally let him go, lightly admonishing, “If you dare to have any ulterior motives in the future, I will not kill you, but I will use the same method as just now to let you experience the consequences of offending me!”

“I… I dare not!” The human face trembled, having discovered Yang Kai’s ruthless nature through this incident.

After completely subduing the human face, Yang Kai felt much more at ease.

“What is your name? How should I address you from now on?” Yang Kai asked.

The human face pondered, “I do not even know what I am called, but I vaguely remember someone calling me Earth Demon! I do not know if this is my name or title.”

“Earth Demon!” Yang Kai nodded slightly, “Indeed a demon.”

The Earth Demon smiled awkwardly, “That was probably a long time ago. From now on, I will only heed the orders of the young master.”

“What about that secret treasure?”

“Replying to the young master, it is within my remains.”

Following the Earth Demon’s guidance, Yang Kai gathered the scattered bones together. He then extracted a rib that seemed to be from the chest. However, this rib was unlike the others; it was pitch black, and the moment he held it, Yang Kai even heard a wailing sound from within, causing his vision to blur.

“What a strong malevolent aura!” Yang Kai's expression darkened.

The Earth Demon explained, “This item is called the Soul-Breaking Spike, which I refined into my own bone. It should have claimed quite a few lives, hence the heavy malevolent aura.”

Yang Kai sneered, “When you refined it, you must have used quite a few souls, right?”

The Earth Demon chuckled dryly, “Young master is wise. Precisely because of this, this secret treasure is not suitable for you to possess. If you forcibly refine it, your temperament may be affected. However, with my divine soul acting as a bridge, you need not worry about this concern. It will just require a bit more Yuan Qi, but it has been dormant for many years. The damage it can inflict now is likely not very strong.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. He could feel that this secret treasure could currently only unleash the power of a Common-Grade lower-level treasure. It was indeed not very high-grade, and a stronger warrior could easily block its attacks.

“How do I collect it?”

The Earth Demon quickly taught Yang Kai the method of subduing it.

After several days of effort, Yang Kai finally claimed this pitch-black secret treasure as his own. This piece of black bone had now transformed into a wisp of black gas, swirling around Yang Kai’s fingertips as if it had its own spirit. Yang Kai could feel a faint connection between himself and it, although the Earth Demon’s divine soul was also mixed in.

After testing it a few times, Yang Kai had a plan in mind.

As he had guessed, the Soul-Breaking Spike could now only exert the power of a Common-Grade lower-level treasure. Moreover, using it consumed a considerable amount of Yuan Qi, as it had to go through the Earth Demon as a middleman, which was somewhat wasteful.

The Earth Demon said, “If the young master wishes to refine it, that is also possible, but it will take some time.”

As he spoke these words, the Earth Demon felt extremely anxious. He feared that Yang Kai would agree immediately, but he had to say it.

“I will not refine it; it will be under your control from now on.”

“Thank you, young master.” The Earth Demon was deeply grateful.

If Yang Kai did not refine it, it meant he could reside within this secret treasure and no longer have to hide in fear within Yang Kai’s golden body. Being in the golden body made the Earth Demon feel like a piece of meat on a chopping board, utterly helpless and desolate.

As he drew the wisp of black gas into his body, the Earth Demon eagerly fled from the golden body and hid within the Soul-Breaking Spike.

After scanning the area again, Yang Kai found that apart from the softly glowing pearl, there was nothing else here.

“Is this the only secret treasure you have?” Yang Kai asked, somewhat dissatisfied. The Earth Demon must have been a powerful figure in life; it was unreasonable for him to have only the Soul-Breaking Spike left.

The Earth Demon smiled bitterly, “Young master, you do not know. A shocking battle occurred here, and I was part of it. During the fight, everything else was shattered, leaving only this Soul-Breaking Spike that was refined into my bone.”
