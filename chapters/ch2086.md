## Chapter 2086 — Soul-Searching

After a short while, Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang's Transmission Compasses both buzzed simultaneously.

Yang Kai channeled his Divine Sense into it and immediately received a transmission from Duan Yuanshan: "Don't hold back — just do it!"

When he looked up, Yang Kai saw Qin Chaoyang wearing a helpless expression.

"Since the City Lord has spoken, go ahead." Qin Chaoyang, though still deeply worried, had no grounds to oppose and could only scheme about how to extract more benefits from the City Lord once this was over.

After all, Qin Yu was a descendant he valued greatly. Even with her Fortune Heavenly Eye, for her to use a Secret Art across several Realms against Jiang Chuhe with only Second Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivation would entail considerable risk.

"Brother Yang, Yu'er is entrusted to your care." Qin Chaoyang spoke sincerely, as if marrying Qin Yu off to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai cupped his fist and said, "Sir Qin, rest assured, I will do my utmost to cooperate in protecting Miss Qin!"

"Lord Yang, please follow me." Qin Yu waved from the side and was the first to fly off.

Yang Kai reached out, lifted Jiang Chuhe, and followed closely behind Qin Yu.

A few Void King Realm warriors who had been assigned to protect Qin Yu also followed.

When Jiang Chuhe had been outside the city, Yang Kai had severed one of his arms; the stump now writhed with a pitch-black aura and no blood flowed from it, which looked extremely eerie.

Before long, they arrived at the Qin Family's main residence.

With Fenglin City's crisis, virtually all Qin Family warriors at or above the Origin Returning Realm had gone to the city walls to assist the defense; those remaining at the Qin residence were mostly young and not very powerful.

As soon as Qin Yu returned, they eagerly gathered around, chattering nonstop, wanting to know how things were outside.

Qin Yu had no time to deal with them; she put on the air of an elder sister and scolded them until those younger siblings dared not utter a word.

But when they saw Jiang Chuhe being carried by Yang Kai, they clustered around again, staring curiously.

Jiang Chuhe suddenly let out a howl. He opened his mouth as if gone mad, frightening those Qin Family heirs into screaming and scattering; the more timid ones burst into tears and rushed inside, calling for cover.

“Lord Yang must find this laughable,” Qin Yu said, leading the way ahead without even turning her head.

Yang Kai said nothing and followed closely behind her.

A moment later, they came to a secret chamber in the Qin residence; outside the chamber, heavy seals and the Spiritual Qi were far denser than the surrounding areas, clearly a place used by important Qin Family members for seclusion.

Upon arriving, Qin Yu formed spirit seals and opened the chamber's restrictions, then turned to the Void King Realm guards and instructed, "You must guard outside; until I come out, allow no one to enter!"

"Yes!" the guards answered in unison, then spread out to keep watch.

Inside the chamber, Qin Yu opened all the seals again, took some items from her Spatial Ring, and arranged them within the chamber.

Yang Kai stood to the side holding Jiang Chuhe, watched for a while and asked, "Miss Qin, are you versed in the way of formations?"

He discovered that Qin Yu was arranging an extremely abstruse formation; though he did not know its exact effect, he suspected it was related to the Secret Art she intended to use next.

From her deft formation work, it was clear Qin Yu was supremely proficient in array techniques.

Qin Yu's hands never paused; she smiled and said, "Because I suffer from an obstinate illness, I cannot go out often like others and have to stay home to study matters unfit for public display. I cannot claim mastery of formations; only that I have researched them a bit."

"Miss Qin is too modest," Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. "I think your formation technique has likely reached a considerable level."

Qin Yu smiled and said, "This formation not only amplifies the power of the Secret Art we will use; it can also temporarily channel Lord Yang's Divine Sense into my body. With that, I can unleash the Soul-Searching Technique as freely as I wish."

"Divine Sense channeling?" Yang Kai's expression shifted. "Is there such a wondrous formation in the world?"

A warrior's Divine Sense was exceedingly difficult to cultivate, far harder than their cultivation stage; if Yang Kai had not obtained the Warm Spirit Lotus in his youth, he would have had to spend enormous time refining his Divine Sense and would not have reached such a level in only a few decades.

He would have spent great effort tempering his Divine Sense.

The Warm Spirit Lotus's effects had saved him a tremendous amount of time and labor.

So Qin Yu's formation enabling Divine Sense channeling between different warriors was somewhat astounding.

If such a formation were used in battle, one could fight above one's rank; a single Divine Sense suppression could overcome an opponent even if one's cultivation were inferior.

"Although this formation is abstruse, it is not as miraculous as Lord Yang imagines. I learned it from an incomplete formation in an ancient book and repaired it myself. When the formation runs, it cannot endure strong interference or it will fail, so it is only suitable for special situations; for instance, right now it cannot be used in combat," Qin Yu explained calmly, as if she knew what Yang Kai was thinking.

"You repaired it yourself..." Yang Kai immediately raised his estimation of Qin Yu in his heart; in the art of formations, she was likely not merely advanced but already a master.

“By the way, with this Divine Sense channeling, will it expose any of my own secrets?” Yang Kai asked again, some concern in his voice.

He had many secrets; although Qin Yu seemed decent, they were not well acquainted, and he naturally did not want her to learn his secrets.

Qin Yu paused and answered, "There is that possibility!"

Yang Kai's face darkened and he was about to back out.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “But Lord Yang may set his mind at ease. There is indeed a risk of exposing one’s secrets, but that applies only to the weaker side… Your Divine Sense is far stronger than mine. Once your Divine Sense is channeled over, I would be unable to glimpse anything of yours. Rather, it is you, Lord, who might…”

She trailed off and her face grew slightly red.

After all, she was a woman, and Yang Kai a man; if some of her private matters were to be inadvertently seen by him, she would be mortified.

Yang Kai hurriedly said, "Miss Qin, do not worry; I will keep to my principles and not probe anything."

He spoke with a solemn expression and a ringing voice.

Qin Yu said nothing and continued to focus on arranging the formation.

Soon the formation inside the chamber was complete.

Yang Kai looked over and found the formation pattern incredibly wondrous, unlike anything he had encountered; he memorized the routes and patterns carefully for possible future use.

Qin Yu sprang into the very heart of the array, formed a spirit-seal with her hand, settled into a seated posture, and intoned, "Lord, please position yourself at the opposite pole from this demonic man."

Yang Kai nodded, slapped Jiang Chuhe's back, poured Origin Qi into him, and used Spatial Laws to form an invisible shackle that bound Jiang Chuhe to a spot in the formation.

At the same moment, Yang Kai's figure blurred as he moved to the opposing position.

Although Jiang Chuhe was bound and his power and movement suppressed, he remained extremely unruly, howling constantly; demon marks writhed on his body and demonic qi rolled, yet no matter how he struggled he could not move an inch.

Seeing this, Qin Yu relaxed and her hand seals began to shift, her delicate hands fluttering like butterflies.

Accompanying her movements, abstruse power spread from her body outward in waves, invisible and formless.

A faint glow suffused above the formation and every formation line seemed to be given new life, beginning to flow.

"Formation, open!" Qin Yu suddenly cried in a melodious shout.

The formation hummed and spun into rapid motion.

In an instant the entire chamber was filled with dazzling light that made it hard to keep one's eyes open, and an invisible force like a rope passed through Yang Kai's body.

In the next moment, Yang Kai felt a strange sensation.

He felt as if he and Qin Yu had become one; he could clearly sense her every breath, the flow of blood in her body, the beating of her heart, the contraction of her pores, and could even vaguely grasp changes in her thoughts.

Qin Yu showed a flash of obvious discomfort, her cheeks flushing faintly; her small lips parted and she called in a soft, clear tone, "Lord, please use your eye technique to suppress this man's soul!"

She knew Yang Kai had this Secret Art because she had specifically asked earlier.

After all, when Yang Kai had advanced previously, she had used her Fateful Heaven Eye from afar to try to peer, but had been countered by Yang Kai's World-Ending Demon Eye, which had led her to suspect his capability.

Today's confirmation proved her suspicion correct.

With Yang Kai's eye technique suppression, she no longer needed Qin Chaoyang's assistance; Yang Kai alone was sufficient.

Hearing Qin Yu's call, Yang Kai immediately unleashed the World-Ending Demon Eye.

In the next moment, golden light burst from his left eye, the imposing vertical pupil appearing and pressing directly toward Jiang Chuhe.

The bound Jiang Chuhe seemed as if gravely wounded in that instant; he cried out loudly, his body trembling as if beset by nightmares, and his already terrifying face grew even more hideous.

After a while Jiang Chuhe's eyes went blank, as if he had lost his will, staring vacantly ahead while drool trickled from the corner of his mouth.

The Divine Sense suppression, comparable to that of a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, was more than Jiang Chuhe could bear even in his demonized state; in only a few breaths he was utterly subdued by the World-Ending Demon Eye.

Qin Yu's face brightened; she closed her eyes, drew a deep breath, and then suddenly opened them.

Silver light shimmered in her eyes, tinting nearly the entire chamber with a silvery hue.

The formation hummed and Yang Kai's Divine Sense was channeled through the formation into Qin Yu, then flowed into Jiang Chuhe's Sea of Consciousness.

At the next instant, darkness swallowed their sight — Qin Yu and Yang Kai were plunged together into a strange, uncanny realm.
