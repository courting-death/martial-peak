## Chapter 2346 — Must Die

The stench of blood soared into the sky, and the sealed-off world between heaven and earth had become a veritable hell on earth.

Shi Cangying, somehow managing to unleash a hidden trump card, did not die immediately. His Essence-Blood burned furiously, barely keeping him alive as he clung desperately to life. Yet the aura of death pressed ever closer, and he could only sob and beg, "Sect Master, I was wrong! Sect Master, please spare my life—I swear I will repent!"

Only now did he finally realize he had chosen the wrong side. If he had known how powerful the ancestral Heavenly Puppets were, how could he have harbored any disloyalty? He would have been even more eager than Ye Hen to study the secret arts of controlling the Heavenly Puppets.

But what use was there in thinking about this now? With the four great Heavenly Puppets unleashed, they barely needed to act—just forming a killing array was enough to annihilate the entire invading force. How could he alone hope to survive?

He could only beg Ye Hen, hoping Ye Hen would spare him for the sake of their years working together.

Liu Yan turned to glance at Ye Hen, seeking his opinion.

Ye Hen's expression was calm as he said lightly, "From the moment you ambushed me and opened the Sect's Protective Mountain Array, you were no longer a member of Chiyue Sect."

Shi Cangying was terrified and shouted, "Sect Master, all these years I have been loyal to the Sect! Even if I have no great merits, I have worked hard. Sect Master, please spare me!"

Ye Hen slowly shook his head and said to Liu Yan, "Miss, do it. I don't want to hear him speak any longer."

If Shi Cangying had merely disagreed with him and their philosophies clashed, Ye Hen would not have killed him. After all, Shi Cangying had always considered the Sect's future, and a little selfishness was only human. There were times when Ye Hen himself had doubted whether his own path of puppetry was right.

But he should never have taken the initiative to open the Protective Mountain Array and let the Sect's disciples be slaughtered.

If Shi Cangying were spared today, how could the souls of the thousand dead disciples rest in peace?

Therefore, Shi Cangying must die!

Upon hearing this, Liu Yan nodded gently. With a mere thought, the supreme killing intent of the Four Divine Beasts Killing Array crashed down upon Shi Cangying.

Before their very eyes, Shi Cangying's body suddenly swelled like an inflated balloon, then exploded into a mist of blood. Not a bone remained.

Thus, not a single one of the invaders of Chiyue Sect survived; all perished in this valley.

Liu Yan formed a seal with her hands, and the four Heavenly Puppets gradually withdrew their killing intent, once again crouching motionless in place.

The stench of blood was overwhelming, and the valley was silent. Ye Hen looked around in all directions. Though he felt some relief, his expression remained sorrowful.

Chiyue Sect had suffered heavy losses this time. If Yang Kai had not appeared at the last moment to delay the enemy, even their foundation might have been destroyed. The only thing that comforted Ye Hen was that Yang Kai had returned safely from the secret realm, bringing back the secret art to control the Heavenly Puppets.

"Father..." Ye Qinghan called softly, supporting her aged father. Seeing his frail state, her eyes reddened.

Ye Hen waved his hand, then solemnly cupped his fist toward Yang Kai and said, "Young Master Yang, your great kindness will never be forgotten by all of Chiyue Sect."

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, "Sect Master Ye, there's no need to be so polite. I didn't do much. Defeating such a powerful enemy in one stroke was thanks to your Sect's Heavenly Puppets."

As he spoke, he glanced at the four Heavenly Puppets, thinking to himself how wonderful it would be to have them by his side. He had witnessed their power firsthand. Although using them to kill Qiu Ze and the others was a bit of overkill, Yang Kai was certain that in the previous battle, not even one percent of their true might had been unleashed.

If their full power could be drawn out, who knew what kind of spectacle it would be.

After a pause, he continued, "After such a great battle, Sect Master Ye must have many matters to attend to. We won't disturb you further. Once you've handled the Sect's affairs, we can talk in detail."

Ye Hen naturally understood his meaning and knew now was not the time for conversation. He nodded at once, "Very well. Qinghan, take Young Master Yang and the others to rest. Once I've dealt with the Sect's matters, I'll come visit."

......

Ye Qinghan led Yang Kai and the others back to the main hall on the main peak, then turned and left.

There was much to do in Chiyue Sect now. Not only did the Sect's grand array need repairs, but many disciples were injured and needed care. Naturally, Ye Qinghan could not stay here.

After she left, Chi Yue and the others suddenly turned their gazes to Yang Kai, all with questioning looks.

The events of today had happened so suddenly that they still had many things they did not understand.

Yang Kai said, "Let's talk in my room."

A short while later, everyone gathered in Yang Kai's side room, where he finally smiled and introduced Hua Qingsi to them.

Although he had previously instructed Hua Qingsi to protect Chi Yue and the others, she had never appeared before them. It was only when Shi Cangying sent people to capture them that Hua Qingsi suddenly acted and injured the attackers.

However, she had not introduced herself, only telling Chi Yue and the others that she was Yang Kai's friend.

Now, after Yang Kai's explanation, they finally understood that Hua Qingsi's actions had all been secretly instructed by him.

"Then... who is this little sister?" Chi Yue looked at Liu Yan in confusion. She always felt there was something unusual about Liu Yan—not dangerous, but her aura was distinctly different from others.

Moreover, for a little girl who looked only seven or eight years old to possess the strength of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was simply unbelievable.

Compared to Liu Yan, Chi Yue and the others felt utterly weak.

Yang Kai didn't know how to explain his relationship with Liu Yan, but Liu Yan stood up, bowed gracefully, and said crisply, "Liu Yan is Master's servant. Greetings, honored guests!"

"Master? Servant?" Chi Yue looked at Yang Kai with a strange expression and snorted, "I didn't expect you to have such tastes."

Ai Ou also looked at Yang Kai with a mocking expression and said, "Does Xue Yue know about this?"

These two—one akin to a mother-in-law and the other to a father-in-law—weren't related by blood, but were still elders to Yang Kai. Naturally, they considered things from Shan Qingluo and Xue Yue's perspective, worried that Yang Kai, having come to this Star Realm, would forget his companions back in the Star Domain. Their tone was stern, with a hint of warning.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and said, "Liu Yan, the connection between our minds has already been severed. From now on, you are free. You don't need to address me that way anymore."

Liu Yan wrinkled her little nose and said, "Master doesn't want me anymore?"

Yang Kai replied, "Of course that's not what I mean. I just mean that since you're free now, you can do whatever you want. If you want to stay by my side, that's wonderful, but if you want to go out and train on your own, that's up to you."

After obtaining a Spirit Puppet body, the connection between Yang Kai and Liu Yan had been severed. Now, Liu Yan truly was free. She had her own thoughts and a physical body—she was a living person, though her body was constructed differently from ordinary people.

Hearing this, Liu Yan thought for a moment, then suddenly smiled and said, "In that case, I choose to stay with Master forever. Please don't drive me away."

Hua Qingsi glared and snorted, "He wouldn't dare!"

"When did I ever want to drive her away?" Yang Kai looked aggrieved, then quickly changed the subject, "By the way, Liu Yan, about the Heavenly Puppets..."

As if she already knew what Yang Kai was thinking, Liu Yan said seriously before he could finish, "Controlling the Heavenly Puppets consumes a tremendous amount—not my own energy, but the puppets' own reserves. Just now, by my estimate, at least a million Source Crystals were consumed."

"Source Crystals? A million?" Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

Liu Yan nodded, "That's right. The Heavenly Puppets already store a large amount of Source Crystals inside, which is why I could control them. And they must be Upper-Level Source Crystals."

Yang Kai drew in a sharp breath.

The four Heavenly Puppets had acted for no more than thirty breaths, and all they did was form the Four Divine Beasts Kill Array—they hadn't even truly fought. Even so, a million Upper-Level Source Crystals were consumed. That was equivalent to a hundred million Lower-Level Source Crystals. What kind of concept was that?

"The Heavenly Puppets are powerful, but you need enough resources to use them," Liu Yan added.

"So, in that case, aren't the Heavenly Puppets in Chiyue Sect just decorations?" Yang Kai figured that Chiyue Sect surely didn't have enough Source Crystals to activate the puppets again, so even if they regained the secret arts, it wouldn't actually boost their strength.

"Not so!" Liu Yan shook her head and explained, "The energy source for Chiyue Sect's Heavenly Puppets is twofold: one is the Source Crystals stored inside, and the other is the Sect's Earth Vein."

Yang Kai's expression changed. "You mean the Earth Vein in the secret realm?"

Liu Yan said, "Exactly. Before, you only repaired the array in the secret realm, but the entrance wasn't fully opened, so the Earth Vein's power couldn't be drawn upon. If it's fully opened, the Heavenly Puppets can use the Earth Vein's power, greatly reducing the number of Source Crystals consumed. Chiyue Sect should be able to afford it." She paused, then added, "But if you want to take a couple of Heavenly Puppets for yourself, you'll have to use Source Crystals to power them."

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded lightly.

If he took the Heavenly Puppets away, he wouldn't be able to use the Earth Vein's power. However, he had an Earth Vein Pearl beneath his medicine garden and plenty of Source Crystals.

So even knowing the cost was enormous, Yang Kai still wanted to take one or two Heavenly Puppets with him. These things could display Emperor Realm strength—they were truly valuable.

Half an hour later, everyone left Yang Kai's room and returned to their own rooms to meditate and cultivate.

Today's battle made Chi Yue and the others realize just how lacking their own strength was.

In the Star Domain, each of them had been a ruler of their own territory. With a single stomp, they could shake an entire Cultivation Star. But here in the Star Realm, they were nothing but insignificant figures.

They were desperate to improve their strength.
