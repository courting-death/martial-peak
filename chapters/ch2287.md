## Chapter 2287 — Wind, Thunder, Fire, Mountain

The wilderness was silent, a gentle breeze sweeping by, yet it carried a chilling sense of impending slaughter.

Ye Qinghan grew increasingly uneasy, though she couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was wrong. She wrapped her clothes tighter around herself, her expression tense and anxious.

“Will you all come out on your own... or do you want me to drag you out myself?” Yang Kai suddenly sneered, shouting into the empty air.

“What? There’s someone here?” Ye Qinghan exclaimed in shock upon hearing this, finally understanding the source of her nervousness. She cried out, “What’s going on?”

“We’re being watched.” Yang Kai’s face was calm and unruffled, showing not the slightest hint of tension. After waiting a moment without a response, he sneered again, “Looks like you’re all quite confident in your concealment techniques, thinking I’m just bluffing?”

As he spat out the last word, his figure suddenly blurred. In the next instant, he appeared thirty zhang ahead, his hand forming a palm as he struck fiercely at the void. Nebulous energy swirled in his palm, power radiating outward.

“Boom..."

As the explosive sound rang out, accompanied by a startled cry, a figure tumbled out of the void, retreating over ten zhang before barely managing to steady themselves.

After landing his strike, Yang Kai had already returned to his wooden boat, hands clasped behind his back, looking completely at ease. “The rest of you, come out as well,” he called out calmly. “Don’t waste my time. I don’t want to drag you out one by one. We’re all adults here—must we really play these childish games?”

No sooner had he finished speaking than, within three breaths, two more figures appeared in the sky around them. Counting the one Yang Kai had just forced out, there were now three in total.

Ye Qinghan stared in stunned disbelief.

If not for Yang Kai’s warning, she might never have realized there were people hiding here. She’d always known the gap between her strength and Yang Kai’s was vast, but she hadn’t expected it to be this great.

She was, after all, at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet she hadn’t sensed any danger at all. If these three had targeted her, her fate would have been sealed...

At this thought, Ye Qinghan broke out in a cold sweat.

“Heh heh...” Yang Kai suddenly laughed, not even glancing at the three who had revealed themselves. Instead, he turned to look at an empty spot and said, “What’s wrong? Do you think you’re well hidden, friend? Don’t you know you’re upwind from me? I could smell your scent from far away.”

As soon as he finished speaking, yet another person appeared in that direction.

“There’s more?” Ye Qinghan’s face turned pale. Releasing her Divine Sense, she found that all four newcomers had their auras tightly restrained, yet were overwhelmingly powerful—each one at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Any one of them could crush her with ease. With four appearing at once, even knowing Yang Kai’s strength, she couldn’t help but worry whether he could handle all four at once.

The four were strange indeed. Since appearing, they hadn’t spoken a word, and their faces were obscured by fierce, grinning ghost masks—obviously some kind of Secret Treasure. The masks blocked Divine Sense probing; even when Yang Kai released his Divine Sense, it was stopped by the masks.

Aside from their masks, the four were dressed identically as well—each clad in tight black attire that looked crisp and efficient. On their garments, a single large character was emblazoned on each, respectively reading: Wind, Thunder, Fire, and Mountain.

The auras they emitted were all different, and there seemed to be a faint connection and resonance between them.

Noticing this, Yang Kai’s expression darkened slightly. He realized these four were likely not to be trifled with and had probably cultivated some kind of joint attack technique.

“Wind, Thunder, Fire, Mountain?” Ye Qinghan frowned, a thoughtful look appearing on her face as if she’d remembered something.

“Friends, you’ve been waiting here for some time. What exactly do you want?” Yang Kai asked with a smile, looking at the four.

The four didn’t move at his words. After a while, the one with the Wind character on his outfit finally spoke in a gruff voice: “Come with us!”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and asked, “Who are you, and where do you want to take me?”

The Thunder character warrior replied coldly, “No need to ask. You’ll know once you come.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Sorry, I’m a bit shy around strangers. I’ve never met any of you before, so I’ll pass on the invitation. Maybe next time.”

As he spoke, he urged his wooden boat forward, preparing to escape.

With a crackling sound, lightning flashed as the Thunder character warrior suddenly transformed into a bolt of lightning, blocking Yang Kai’s path. He snorted coldly, “I’m afraid you don’t have a choice.”

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. He thought to himself how fast this man was—his short-range movement was probably no slower than Yang Kai’s own teleportation. Judging by the aura he emitted, he must have cultivated a thunder-based technique.

Thunder element power was inherently fierce and swift, so this speed was only natural.

Yang Kai’s expression immediately darkened.

Clearly, these people had been hiding here for some time, and from their attitude and words, it seemed they were waiting specifically for him.

Yet Yang Kai had no idea where these four came from or what they wanted with him.

The only ones he’d offended recently were Fei Sheng Palace and Evil Moon Valley, but neither of those sects could possibly have such powerful warriors. It definitely wasn’t them causing trouble for him.

Yang Kai secretly guessed it was probably trouble caused by the Myriad Sword in his possession.

But then he reconsidered—if that were the case, there’d be no need to take him away; they’d just kill him and seize the treasure.

As his thoughts raced, Yang Kai laughed, “Friend, you’re awfully fast. May I ask why you want me to come with you?”

“No comment!” the Thunder character warrior replied coldly.

“With that kind of arrogance, it’s impossible to cooperate!” Yang Kai curled his lip.

“Enough talk, just take him down.” The Fire character warrior, apparently hot-tempered from cultivating fire-based techniques, growled impatiently. As soon as he finished, a blood-red long saber appeared in his hand. With a surge of power, the blade swept up a cloud of fire and slashed down at Yang Kai.

In an instant, the air temperature soared, and the sky was dyed a fiery red.

“Blood Saber!” Ye Qinghan suddenly cried out, covering her red lips with her small hand, her beautiful eyes trembling violently in terror.

Yang Kai frowned, and as his figure flickered, he took Ye Qinghan with him, dodging that terrifying strike and reappearing dozens of zhang away. He looked coldly at the four and asked, “Do you know where these people are from?”

“Blood Saber! It’s the Blood Saber!” Ye Qinghan replied in a trembling voice.

“So tell me, what is a Blood Saber?” Yang Kai demanded impatiently.

Ye Qinghan took a deep breath to calm herself before answering, “Blood Saber is an organization—not a sect, but with a foundation even stronger than top-tier sects. No one knows where their headquarters is, but in all four regions of the Star Realm, you can occasionally see their activities. They often take money to kill for others; as long as you can pay, there’s no one they won’t dare to kill. And when they act, it’s always to the death!” At this point, her voice was already trembling. “Young Master Yang, how did you end up targeted by Blood Saber?”

Yang Kai curled his lip, “I’m just as baffled. I’d never even heard of Blood Saber before this.”

As he spoke, he shouted at the four, “You’re from Blood Saber, right? Can I ask who wants me dead?”

“No one!” To Yang Kai’s surprise, the Wind character warrior actually answered, “We’re just following orders from above to bring you back to headquarters. So please cooperate.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Seems being too flashy isn’t always a good thing.”

“You can still joke at a time like this?” Ye Qinghan stamped her foot.

“Look at me!” Yang Kai stared seriously at Ye Qinghan, his voice low. “Do I look like I’m joking? Am I not flashy enough?”

“You’re driving me crazy!” Ye Qinghan’s face flushed red with frustration.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Suddenly, the sound of something slicing through the air rang out. Taking advantage of Yang Kai and Ye Qinghan’s conversation, the Wind character warrior raised his hand and unleashed his own Blood Saber, sending out several Wind Blades. The Wind Blades were blood-red, as if formed from congealed blood, and carried a nauseating, bloody stench.

Who knew how many people these guys had killed? Every move was vicious and ruthless, exuding a violent aura.

Yang Kai’s figure flickered again, easily dodging the attacks. He looked mockingly at the Blood Saber group and said, “If that’s all you’ve got, you’d best go home and farm. The outside world isn’t so easy—one day you might lose your lives for no reason at all.”

At his taunt, only the Fire character warrior’s eyes flashed with anger; the other three remained unmoved.

The Wind character warrior nodded, “Just as the rumors say, you possess space abilities. Not easy to deal with.”

The Thunder character warrior said, “That’s exactly why you’re worth taking back.”

“Let’s begin!” the Fire character warrior urged impatiently.

“Attack!” the Wind character warrior shouted, his body trembling as he activated his power. Instantly, wind surged and clouds roared, the howling never ceasing. A vortex of wind formed around him, his hands forming seals, his expression strained as if preparing to unleash a powerful secret technique.

At the same time, the other three did the same, though the power surging from each was completely different.

Yang Kai’s expression grew serious. He called out to Ye Qinghan, “Protect yourself.”

As soon as he finished, he charged forward, the Myriad Sword appearing in his hand. Imperial Aura surged, sword energy overflowing, sword intent filling the air as if to split the heavens and earth, slashing straight at the Wind character warrior.

Since the enemy knew he possessed space abilities yet still dared to block him here, they clearly had some backup plan. The secret technique they were preparing together was likely that plan.

Not knowing their true intentions, Yang Kai couldn’t allow them to complete their technique unimpeded.

As his sword fell, the world changed color and the universe seemed to crack apart.

Even before the sword light arrived, the killing intent was already upon them. The Wind character warrior’s eyes narrowed, sensing the approach of death.

Yet he didn’t dodge. Beneath the ghost mask, his eyes flashed with determination, and his hands formed seals even faster.
