## Chapter 1957 — The Strongest Blood Beast Is Born

Leaving a mark of his own spirit imprint on it was only the first step.

After finishing that, Yang Kai released his restraint on the Sentient Sword Intent; sure enough, it bore no trace of hostility toward Yang Kai now, and instead displayed a certain fondness, the snow-white sword light whirling around him like a newborn opening its eyes to see the parents who raised it.

It no longer posed the slightest threat to Yang Kai and would instead obey his various commands.

Yang Kai paid it no heed, letting it circle about him, and instead closed his eyes to restore his Divine Sense.

A day later he was back to normal and opened his eyes; the sword intent had ceased its circling and now rested quietly on Yang Kai’s shoulder.

"Come, come — time for a little remaking." Though Yang Kai knew speaking to it was pointless, he still couldn’t help the words. He reached out, gestured, trapped the sword intent in his palm, then tapped his fingers in quick succession. Several strands of golden blood threads shot out in response and flew to coil around the sword intent.

The sword intent seemed to want to resist, but under Yang Kai’s soothing it quickly calmed.

Before long, the snow-white Sentient Sword Intent was wrapped so tightly by the golden blood threads that not a gap remained; the great force of qi and blood carried within the golden threads continuously poured into the sword intent and was absorbed by it.

Half a day later, the once snow-white sword intent had clearly transformed into a golden brilliance; at this point the sword intent was not merely a gathered energy—covered by the golden blood threads, it now displayed obvious qi-and-blood fluctuations, and it would not be an exaggeration to say it had taken on a body of its own.

The golden blood threads served as body, the sword intent as soul. In a sense, this sword intent had been reborn.

That was not all; with a thought from Yang Kai, the golden sword intent trembled and shot directly into the flesh of the Yao Worm Matriarch.

The Yao Worm Matriarch, lying on the ground with no sign of life, underwent a marked change in an instant—golden hues flowed through its snow-white body, and under the influence and repair of that vast qi-and-blood force, a body once riddled by Secret Art backlash gradually began to restore itself and its slowness eased.

Powerful fluctuations of strength surged within the Yao Worm Matriarch’s body.

Its once lifeless, snow-white eyes gradually began to glow faintly.

Yang Kai watched the Yao Worm Matriarch’s changes carefully, and monitored the degree of fusion between the Sentient Sword Intent and the Yao Worm Matriarch.

The method he now employed was entirely different from the previous instance when the sword intent had merely possessed the matriarch: before, the sword intent had only casually attached to the host, simply controlling that body so its consciousness had a vessel.

But now Yang Kai was using the technique for condensing a Blood Beast—reforging the link between the sword intent and the Yao Worm Matriarch in this new way.

If it succeeded, Yang Kai would immediately gain a powerful Blood Beast!

And if it failed… Yang Kai considered failure unlikely.

After all, the sword intent had already achieved a certain degree of compatibility with the matriarch’s flesh and spirit beforehand; coupled with his methods, failure was nearly impossible.

As time passed, the colors on the Yao Worm Matriarch’s body gradually merged into gold and white, and the harmonizing of flesh and spirit became increasingly stable—an obvious sign of success drawing near.

To be safe, Yang Kai even sliced his palm and forced out several drops of his purest Golden Blood to merge into the Yao Worm Matriarch’s body, repairing its tattered flesh.

At one moment the matriarch’s snow-white eyes suddenly shone with a strange golden light, and then the immense body stirred slightly, as if the sword intent were getting accustomed to the body it had fused with.

It painfully hauled itself up from the ground like a toddling infant, swaying and staggering, nearly collapsing several times.

When it could finally support itself and crawl back and forth on the ground, Yang Kai could not help but laugh.

It had worked!

Although the idea that gave rise to this was somewhat strange, the result proved he had not been wrong—using different spirits and bodies one could still condense a Blood Beast!

After all, a Blood Beast was not truly a living thing but a change of the dead—an art accompanying the Golden Blood Threads technique—so its material requirements were not that strict.

Even while crawling on the ground, its body rose a head above Yang Kai and projected great intimidation; the more Yang Kai looked at this newly created work, the more satisfied he became.

He could clearly sense within the Yao Worm Matriarch’s flesh the chaotic will of the sword intent that was unusually close to him.

Their previous clash had ended inconclusively, never testing the creature’s true limits; now Yang Kai naturally wanted to see just how tremendous a force it could unleash.

With a thought he issued an order to the Yao Worm Matriarch.

At once the matriarch straightened its upper body, and on its right-hand pincer an energy longsword immediately manifested.

When the sword appeared, an ice-cold intent and the Power of the Laws gathered upon its edge; the surrounding temperature plummeted, snowflakes fell, and wherever the blade pointed the snowflakes turned into sharp attacks, roaring toward that patch of void.

Snow Like Clear Sky!

Violent power erupted; heaven and earth darkened and the void ahead seemed to be torn open, with the Power of the Laws dying and being born within it.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly.

Truly befit a sword intent that had become sentient—its mastery of this sword-art technique already carried the bearing of a grandmaster; then again, it was unsurprising, since this was a sword intent attached to a move originally used by an Emperor expert, and when the matriarch now unleashed it, it was as if that Emperor expert had struck in person.

The power was far less, yet the profound intent remained unchanged.

"This strike should be equivalent to a full-force blow from a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm warrior, right?" Yang Kai frowned and murmured as he stared at the Yao Worm Matriarch.

He felt no displeasure—the experiment had met his expectations.

Although he had earlier sensed power fluctuations from the matriarch roughly equivalent to an Emperor, once transformed into a Blood Beast its power would always be somewhat weaker than the original.

That was to be expected.

The Blood Beast army he had previously condensed had been the same.

Besides, the sword intent and the matriarch’s body had only just fused; it could not possibly display all of its strength.

After some time it might rise noticeably; Yang Kai estimated its ceiling would be roughly the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

That was more than enough!

Having such a power—comparable to a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert—at his command gave Yang Kai a foothold in the Star Realm; he no longer needed to be timid as when he first arrived.

Still, external aid remained external; true strength lay in one’s own power.

Yang Kai had long appreciated this and would not pin all his hopes on outside forces.

This closed excursion into the Ice Cliff had yielded great gains.

Not to mention the Ice Flower — a rare, peerless treasure. Even simply taking the Yao Worm Matriarch as a heavy-hitter made Yang Kai's trip worthwhile; moreover, he had broken through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm here, converted over half of his Origin Qi, and grasped the Nothingness Secret Art.

Yang Kai was in high spirits. Looking at the Yao Worm Matriarch before him, he thought it was time to find an ice-attribute Secret Treasure longsword for it.

If it were aided by a suitable Secret Treasure, the power of its Secret Art would be noticeably enhanced.

Imagine facing an enemy then—matriarch wielding a longsword and executing Snow Like Clear Sky; the foe would be dumbstruck.

Yang Kai had many Secret Treasures, but apart from a few Imperial Treasures there was nothing suitable, and certainly no ice-attribute longsword fit for the matriarch.

After all, what demonic beast was skilled in sword-art techniques?

He ordered the Yao Worm Matriarch to remain in the Small Xuan Realm to nurture its spirit and fuse further with its body, then left.

The rest no longer required his care; time’s refinement and accumulation would deepen the fusion between the sword intent and the matriarch until it reached its peak and became a complete Blood Beast.

Yang Kai looked forward to it.

The following days were uneventful: Yang Kai formed a new cave dwelling five hundred zhang below the Ice Cliff and lived there in peace, tempering his will in the special environment.

He also immersed himself in studying the new Nothingness Secret Art.

One day Yang Kai stood atop the Ice Cliff and gazed into the distance.

By his calculation the three-month confinement should end that day, so he waited there for Kou Wu to come fetch him.

Although the confinement had ended, he had after all been sealed away — if he hurried back on his own he might only bring trouble upon himself. Yang Kai didn't want to stir up any more waves, so he chose to play it safe.

But to his surprise he waited a long while without seeing Kou Wu.

Only as the day neared its end did a small black dot appear in the distance.

Yang Kai’s face brightened and he focused his mind to look.

The newcomer’s form soon resolved in Yang Kai’s sight; it was not the Kou Wu he had expected, but a cultivator he had never seen before.

From the fluctuations of the man’s power, he appeared only to be at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

The man halted some distance away, clearly unwilling to approach the Ice Cliff forbidden area; he stared in Yang Kai’s direction and shouted, "Senior Brother Kou sent me today to tell you the confinement is over; you may return to the sect."

After speaking he turned and left.

Yang Kai was stunned and immediately flew after him at great speed.

Both were at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; the other traveled at an unhurried pace, so Yang Kai, being on the same level, naturally caught up in no time.

Flying abreast, the man subtly furrowed his brow and silently widened the distance between them.

Yang Kai noticed this but didn’t make an issue of it; he cupped his fist in salute and politely asked, “May I ask Senior Brother your honored surname?”

The man replied impatiently, "I was merely sent by Senior Brother Kou to deliver a message; you need not try to butter me up."

His expression was cold and aloof, as if Yang Kai owed him a heavy debt.

Rebuffed, Yang Kai felt dejected but still asked, "Why didn’t Senior Brother Kou come today, and instead trouble you to come here?"

"Senior Brother Kou has a mission and left the sect a month ago; if you wish to wait for him to fetch you, you’d better return to the Ice Cliff!" the man said rapidly, then suddenly accelerated and shot forward, leaving Yang Kai behind.
