## Chapter 391 — Yang Zhao

The Transformation Dragon Pool is a place where fish leap over the dragon gate, transforming into dragons.

This is an important location for the Yang Family, and also a treasure ground!

The waters within the Transformation Dragon Pool possess profound mysteries that greatly benefit martial artists. It is said that soaking in it can wash the marrow and change one’s physique. A martial artist who can bathe in it for several days will surely see an increase in strength, and even a potential enhancement in their innate talents.

A martial artist's innate talent is the foundation of their growth, the cornerstone; it determines how far a martial artist can ascend. Generally, it is very difficult to change one’s talent after birth, unless one consumes some exceedingly rare heaven-and-earth treasures.

The Transformation Dragon Pool of the Yang Family has such effects.

It has always been a place that the members of the Yang Family clamored to enter.

However, even for the direct descendants of the Yang Family, entering the Transformation Dragon Pool is not an easy task. They must undergo scrutiny from the Elder Council, and only if the council deems that the direct descendant has enough merit will they be granted permission.

As for those unrelated by blood to the Yang Family, it is even harder for them to enter the Transformation Dragon Pool; unless they accomplish something extraordinary, they would have to be generously granted entry.

"Young Master, Yuxian and I have been to the Transformation Dragon Pool. It is indeed a wonderful place," Tu Feng said quietly, excitement evident in his voice.

"That's right. I got severely injured while protecting Miss Mei back then and was nearly killed. Thankfully, Miss Mei spoke on my behalf to Uncle Wu, which allowed me to enter the Transformation Dragon Pool. Not only did my injuries stabilize, but my strength also improved," Tang Yuxian nodded in agreement.

How could Yang Kai not know the value and effects of the Transformation Dragon Pool? Upon hearing Yin Tianyou say this, he couldn't help but smile bitterly.

Back when he was at home, because of his innate deficiencies, his father, Yang Yingfeng, had applied to the Elder Council several times, hoping to let him soak in the Transformation Dragon Pool, to see if it could make up for his shortcomings.

But no matter how many times Yang Yingfeng applied, every request was rejected by the Elder Council!

Why waste the benefits of the Transformation Dragon Pool on a waste!

As a result, every time his father saw him, there was a look of guilt on his face, as if blaming himself for having a son with such flaws. During that time, his mother, Dong Suzhu, was also in deep sorrow, washing her face with tears.

Both parents often took on family tasks.

Yang Zhao, the second-ranked among the direct descendants of the family, is the son of Uncle Yang Yinghao.

Uncle Yang Yinghao is the current head of the Yang Family! It was also because he was injured in the battle against the Cangyun Evil Land that the family recalled its disciples from external training ahead of time.

In contrast to Yang Kai's obscurity, although Yang Zhao had never shown himself to the public, most of the family knew of his existence and recognized his appearance, thanks to Yang Yinghao.

Yang Kai had met him a few times, but they were not particularly familiar.

Upon seeing Yang Zhao, Yin Tianyou's expression immediately became much more serious, and those following him also held their breath, growing quiet.

Regardless of Yang Zhao's actual strength or performance in the struggle for succession, as the current head's son, he could not be neglected.

"Young Master..." Yin Tianyou was quite astute; he first greeted Yang Kai with respect.

"You go about your business," Yang Kai nodded indifferently.

"Thank you, Young Master!" He hastily adjusted his attire and once Yang Zhao came closer, he hurriedly repeated what he had just discussed with Yang Kai.

Yang Zhao remained seated on his Treading Cloud Steed, motionless, and after listening to Yin Tianyou's report, he gently nodded, "I see."

Having said that, he turned his gaze and smiled at Yang Kai, "You must be Younger Brother Kai, right?"

"Second Brother!" Yang Kai slightly cupped his fists and smiled broadly.

"It's indeed Younger Brother Kai! Haha." Yang Zhao laughed heartily, inspecting Yang Kai from head to toe. "They say girls bloom into beauty at eighteen; I see boys too change dramatically by eighteen! It’s been years since our last meeting, and I hardly recognized you. Where is that frail boy from back then? You are clearly a handsome young talent now, truly worthy of being a member of the Yang Family!"

His tone carried an air of superiority, as if bespeaking his status as the head of the Yang Family.

"You flatter me, Second Brother," Yang Kai seemed to not fully comprehend, merely responding flatly.

While the two conversed, the few capable individuals following Yang Zhao examined Yang Kai, and after a moment, they couldn't help but show expressions of disdain, as if they looked down upon him.

Only the two Blood Servants remained unperturbed.

This was also understood by Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian. The Blood Servants were loyal to the Yang Family, and with both Yang Zhao and Yang Kai as sons of the Yang Family, they, of course, should not and could not show favoritism toward either.

However, noticing the disdain of the strangers, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian could not help but frown, casting cold looks towards those few individuals.

In an instant, the faces of those few turned awkward, quickly restraining their expressions.

Yang Zhao's gaze flickered, slightly surprised as he glanced at Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, seemingly not expecting them to defend Yang Kai so.

Even he, throughout this journey, had not earned a favorable view from the two Blood Servants escorting him. Those two Blood Servants were just blandly fulfilling their duties, not saying a single extra word to him.

Upon comparison, Yang Zhao immediately realized something might be unusual.

Yang Kai seemed to be favored by those two Blood Servants! Why was that?

Holding this question in his heart, Yang Zhao did not show it, only stating flatly, "Did you fly back here, Younger Brother Kai?"

Noticing that Yang Kai and the others did not have any mounts, it was a reasonable assumption.

Yang Kai could only nod in acknowledgment.

"Then it must have been an arduous journey," Yang Zhao empathized, saying, and then surprisingly dismounted from his Treading Cloud Steed to walk directly in front of Yang Kai, warmly suggesting, "If you don’t mind, shall we go to the Transformation Dragon Pool together? Along the way, let Second Brother hear about your glorious experiences from these years."

"Sure," Yang Kai smiled upon hearing this.

"Let’s go!" Yang Zhao laughed heartily. After walking a few steps, he suddenly turned back, "Oh right, you all wait for me at the residence. I'll likely be back in three to five days."

The few strangers nodded in unison.

The two Blood Servants had no such reaction; they were only tasked with safely escorting Yang Zhao back to the clan, and upon reaching this point, their job was considered completed, allowing them to return to the Blood Servant Hall.

"Thank you both for your hard work," Yang Kai smiled slightly at Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

The two spoke in unison, "Young Master take care!"

Such a warm attitude caused Yang Zhao and the other two Blood Servants to frequently glance at each other.

After Yang Kai and Yang Zhao departed, the four Blood Servants exchanged glances and remained silent. They soared into the air and flew towards the Blood Servant Hall.

Halfway along the road, one of the two finally spoke. “Tu Feng, from the way you and Yuxian act, it seems you hold that Young Master in high regard. Did he show something special? Tell us about it.”

The Blood Servants were well acquainted with each other; they would not show it in front of outsiders but naturally felt free when alone.

Tu Feng slowly shook his head, "Nothing special. It's just that the Young Master is quite kind."

Even though they were not outsiders, Tu Feng would not be foolish enough to betray Yang Kai. After all, anyone here could potentially become Yang Kai's enemy, and praising him now would only lead to trouble later.

The other person clearly disbelieved Tu Feng's words and frowned at him.

"And what about you? How is the second Young Master whom you brought back?" Tu Feng diverted the topic, asking in return.

The two appeared indifferent, and the prior questioner replied, "Nothing particularly special; his performance was average."

The four suddenly exchanged knowing looks and chuckled together.

Everyone knew the other party was speaking nonsense! Yet even knowing this, they would not expose it; at this moment, every Blood Servant must absolutely not leak information about the young masters. Not even if the clan head or Elder Council asked.

Blood Servants are loyal servants, synonymous with fidelity!

At this moment, Yang Kai and Yang Zhao strolled leisurely towards the location of the Transformation Dragon Pool, discussing the trivialities of the experiences they had over the past few years while avoiding the topics of the sect and their own studies. 

Both understood that while they are brothers, they are also foes! One never knows when the other might set a trap or employ underhanded tactics, striking them into eternal damnation!

The struggle for inheritance is a fraternal war as well as a battle of wits and courage!
