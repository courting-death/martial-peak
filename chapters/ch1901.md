## Chapter 1901 — Zuo De

Those Origin-Grade alchemists, wary of Master Zuo De's status, did not dare speak much with Yang Kai; only Zong Ao paid him no mind, coming up beside Yang Kai to whisper quietly.

Yang Kai took the chance to ask about Gu Bihu's condition; Zong Ao had remained in that palace these past days, watching Gu Bihu's injury changes constantly, so he knew her situation thoroughly.

Yang Kai also obtained a great deal of useful information.

"By the way, who is that fellow? Why did he leap out and latch onto me before I even said anything?" Yang Kai signaled toward the hawk-hook-nosed man and asked.

Zong Ao whispered, "This man is called Zhan Yuan. His alchemical talent was decent, but without a proper teacher he never achieved much and lived in obscurity. By chance he once received guidance from Master Zuo De, which suddenly opened his mind and let him swiftly rise to an Origin-Grade, Middle-Level alchemist. For that reason he has always styled himself the master's disciple, and with that bond he naturally cannot bear you saying such things."

"I see." Yang Kai's face registered understanding.

It seemed Zhan Yuan did not merely revere Zuo De, but treated him as an enlightening mentor; Zuo De's weight in his heart was therefore extraordinarily heavy. Although Yang Kai had not spoken ill of Zuo De, merely saying the master had some airs was enough for him to take offense.

"However, Master Zuo De… ah, it's hard to say," Zong Ao implied, trailing off.

Yang Kai, however, knew exactly what he meant.

Both were alchemists; Zuo De's standing came first. No matter what, Zong Ao could not show him disrespect — to disrespect Zuo De would be to disrespect the Dao of alchemy — so some things Zong Ao simply could not say aloud.

"In short, be careful. Although you, boy, are now an expert of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, do not underestimate the power of a Void King-Grade alchemist. To put it bluntly, if Chairman Ai Ou had to choose between you and Master Zuo De, I reckon he'd choose the latter eighty percent of the time!"

"I understand." Yang Kai smiled faintly.

As the two spoke in low voices, a warrior in golden armor suddenly rushed in from outside, clasped his fist, and, with a grave expression, told Ai Ou, "Chairman. Master Zuo De… has arrived!"

"Arrived?" Ai Ou's eyes flashed brilliantly; he waved a hand and called out, "Quick, invite him!"

Then he hurriedly added, "No — I shall go personally to greet him!"

They had waited half a year, every moment full of anxiety, fearful Gu Bihu would not hold out until the master's arrival. Now that the master had come to Shuitian City, a great weight lifted from Ai Ou's heart.

Once the master refined the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, Gu Bihu could be pulled from her coma.

Saying that, he smoothed his robes and quickly strode outside.

The others in the hall did not dare lag behind; almost all present were alchemists, and upon hearing Zuo De had come they could not restrain themselves and followed Ai Ou out to get a look at the master's visage.

The hawk-hook-nosed man named Zhan Yuan, passing by Yang Kai, glared at him viciously, a grim smile on his face as if to say, now that the master has arrived, you're finished.

Yang Kai sneered and paid him no mind.

"Let's go; better to go welcome him. If the master sees us standing here doing nothing, he'll likely take offense — life is already turbulent enough," Zong Ao shook his head and walked out without haste.

Yang Kai pondered a moment, then followed.

Outside, with Ai Ou at the head, a dozen or so Origin-Grade alchemists stood behind him in a line, all looking up to the sky.

In a certain part of that sky, a streak of rainbow light flew toward them at great speed; apparently some Secret Treasure was being used.

Few would dare use a Secret Treasure in a place like Shuitian City, and even fewer would be so ostentatious, but Master Zuo De absolutely had that privilege, and no one dared protest.

Yang Kai had assumed the arrival was by Star Shuttle.

But upon closer inspection, it was not so.
Though the rainbow light still hung some distance from the main hall, Yang Kai's cultivated sight made it out plainly: a peculiarly styled eight-person palanquin, borne by four carriers in front and four behind—eight in all—wind swirling at their feet as they rushed the palanquin toward them, leaving a trail of resplendent light.

The eight bearers were all graceful, pretty young women.

The palanquin itself was extravagantly decorated, the seat wide. On the seat were two figures, an old and a young one; the elder's beard and hair were white, seeming to be resting with closed eyes, carefree, while the younger was a woman who stood on the palanquin looking about with lively curiosity.

"This Flying Star-Chasing-Moon palanquin was specially made for the master by the Hengluo Commerce Guild; it's about ten percent faster than the best Star Shuttle, and those women are guest elders the guild provided to the master — this conveyance has almost become the master's emblem," Zong Ao explained softly to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai chuckled, "If Master Zong Ao advances another step he too will be a Void King-Grade alchemist and will certainly enjoy such treatment."

Zong Ao disdainfully shook his head, "I only aim to pursue the Dao of alchemy to its utmost; I care nothing for these external trappings."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and said no more.

Moments later, that Flying Star-Chasing-Moon palanquin descended before the hall, alighting steadily, and before Ai Ou could utter a word a figure shot out from it.

With a laugh like silver bells, a lithe, enticing figure pounced to Yang Kai's side and grabbed someone standing next to him, burying that person's head in her embrace and breathing greedily and exaggeratedly.

Everyone was shocked — who would be so ill-mannered as to do such a shameless thing in public? They all turned toward the enchanting figure.

Once they saw clearly, many smiled knowingly; Yang Kai, however, stood stunned.

For he realized the graceful figure who had shot from the palanquin and flung herself into an embrace had, to his surprise, seized Xue Yue — the very Xue Yue standing at his side!

Xue Yue's expression was mortified; she clearly had not expected such a scene in public, neither pushing her away nor allowing it, frozen and helpless.

Yang Kai boiled with anger, instinctively wanting to rush up and give the woman a beating so she'd know his woman could not be violated.

But then he thought the other was a woman, so he let it slide.

The woman rubbed against Xue Yue like a kitten, then lifted her head to reveal a face that could eclipse the moon and shame the flowers, and in a coquettish voice cooed, "Brother Xue Yue, it's been years—did you miss me?"

Xue Yue's mouth twitched; she forced a dry laugh, "So it's Zuo Ling… who would be so bold. Er, Zuo Ling, please let go and let me speak."

"Hee hee," Zuo Ling obediently released Xue Yue, standing one zhang away as she appraised him with narrowed eyes, then nodded, "After all these years, Xue Yue gege has grown even more handsome and valiant; no wonder the girls throughout the Star Domain remain infatuated with you, utterly obsessed."

Her words carried a sour trace of jealousy, yet complimented openly; anyone with even a little sense saw what was meant.

That girl Zuo Ling had probably long harbored feelings for Xue Yue.

It was not surprising: as the dream lover of the Star Domain's maidens, Xue Yue's charm could easily captivate a young girl.

And from Zuo Ling's words it seemed the two had known each other a long time.

"Zuo Ling, you flatter me!" Xue Yue forced a laugh.

If Yang Kai had not been there it might have passed, but with him standing and watching, feeling his gaze, Xue Yue felt as if being scratched all over, unbearably uncomfortable.

"Ling'er, behave!" came a stern voice from behind; Zuo De slowly rose from the palanquin and scolded in a deep tone.

Zuo Ling stuck out her tongue at Xue Yue and whispered, "I'll come find you later, Xue Yue gege; Grandpa's calling me."

With that she moved like a nimble cat to the palanquin and respectfully helped Zuo De down.

Yang Kai looked at Xue Yue with a slight, peculiar smile.

Xue Yue, annoyed, shot him a glare full of iciness.

"Welcome, Master — you've endured much on your journey!" It was only now that Chairman Ai Ou found the chance to speak, clasping his fist toward Zuo De in greeting.

"Greetings, Master! Thank you for your efforts!" Many Origin-Grade alchemists bowed respectfully.

"Heh heh, an old pile of bones, the road was a little bumpy; thank you all for waiting so long!" Zuo De returned the salute with a slight bow.

Yang Kai sized up the master nearby and found him surprisingly ordinary, like a common old man; his cultivation was only the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet his every movement carried a faint medicinal scent, clearly from long years spent with pills.

By appearance alone, Master Zuo De seemed quite affable.

Perhaps there really had been something that delayed him for half a year, Yang Kai thought; otherwise Ai Ou would not have invited him and waited so long.

"Master, after your arduous journey, would you like me to arrange a place for you to rest for a short while?" Ai Ou asked with concern.

"Hmm, that would be good; I am indeed a little tired," Zuo De nodded and agreed.

Ai Ou froze, staring blankly at Zuo De, thinking: I merely offered politely — you actually took me at my word? Is the anxiety on my face not obvious enough? Or are your old eyes failing?

The other Origin-Grade alchemists also furrowed their brows.

Everyone thought Master Zuo De's behavior somewhat improper.

Letting others wait half a year might be one thing, but you are a Void King-Grade alchemist with the right and the airs; now that you have arrived you should hurry to set up your furnace and refine the pill — saving a life is the priority.

Besides, the journey used a warship and a Flying Star-Chasing-Moon palanquin; there was no need to exert oneself and thus no reason to be fatigued.

Ai Ou's expression had already become uglier.
