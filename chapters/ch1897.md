## Chapter 1897 — I’ll Go Take a Look

"Father has been beset by worries these days; nothing makes him happy. I hope this news will bring him some smiles. I must tell him as soon as possible..." Xue Yue said, her face buoyant.

Yang Kai looked at her with some surprise and asked suspiciously, "If I remember correctly, didn’t you hate Chairman Ai Ou? How come you’re so concerned now?"

"That was in the past. I resented him because I had to keep up this disguise every moment—unable to show my true face or live as I wished. But things are different now. In this world there is someone who knows my true self and can see me as I truly am; that is enough. Besides, he acted to protect me. He is my father—I have no reason to hate him."

As she spoke she smiled sweetly, as if all the misfortunes forced upon her over the years had been blown away by Yang Kai’s arrival.

Yang Kai remembered that she had once said in the Lost Realm that if there was even one person who treated her as an ordinary woman, she would be satisfied.

Yang Kai was slightly moved, and suddenly realized that this beauty dressed as a man had such a simple request.

"What exactly happened to Chairman Ai Ou?" Yang Kai asked.

Xue Yue’s expression dimmed and she said softly, "It’s about the young wife..."

"The young wife..." Yang Kai was stunned, but he quickly realized she must mean Chairman Ai Ou’s current wife.

Xue Yue’s mother had long since passed away, so Ai Ou’s current wife would naturally be referred to that way.

Xue Yue gave a bitter smile. "Although Father dominates a region, he has always taken matters of affection very seriously. Especially toward the young wife — he cherished her and protected her; she was the woman he loved most. A year ago, when the young wife entered seclusion to break through to the Void King Realm something went wrong, causing Qi Deviation; her meridians were severed and she nearly died on the spot. Father used a great divine technique to suppress the crisis at the time, but he still could not let her escape unscathed. After that she fell into an unending coma. Her life hung by a thread. Over the past year Father tried every method to wake her, but he didn’t succeed."

"Something went wrong during the breakthrough to the Void King Realm..." Yang Kai shuddered as he realized the severity of the problem.

A warrior at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, if something went wrong at such a critical moment, could easily lose their life; that the young wife did not die on the spot was entirely thanks to Ai Ou’s formidable strength.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild’s chairman was a veteran Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

"At that time her body was already severely damaged, essentially beyond hope, but Father used a heaven-defying object to pull her back from the brink of death and preserve her life. Half a year ago he used some divine relic to mend her body."

As Xue Yue spoke she kept looking at Yang Kai; although she did not explicitly say what Ai Ou had used, Yang Kai knew that only a few treasures in the world could restore someone from the brink of death.

The Immortal Source Liquid was one of them!

In the Lost Realm the Everlasting Tree produced three drops of Immortal Source Liquid. The three Second‑Stage Void Kings present debated how to split them: one fell to Ni Guang, another to Zi Long, and the final drop slipped from the Ghost Ancestor’s grasp.

Yang Kai ultimately made off with the entire Everlasting Tree and entrusted that remaining drop to the Ghost Ancestor. 

And the drop Zi Long had once held was the very one Yang Kai kept for himself.

The divine relic Ai Ou used half a year ago was definitely Immortal Source Liquid.

Immortal Source Liquid could restore flesh to white bone and bring the dead back to life; it was the most precious healing sacred medicine in the world, even coveted by those at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Carrying a drop of Immortal Source Liquid was like carrying an extra life; Ai Ou gave it to the young wife without hesitation, which showed how deep his feelings were for her.

"Her life was saved, but she still shows no sign of waking. Over this long time Father sought many pill masters to examine her; he himself observed carefully and reached the conclusion that her soul had suffered permanent damage. Unless a Void King-Grade pill that repairs the soul can be forged, she cannot wake. Moreover... even if such a pill could be made, the chance she would awaken is small. Father has been utterly consumed by worry over her these days; watching it has been very painful for me."

Yang Kai listened quietly, slowly piecing together the facts, then asked in a low voice, "Did those pill masters say what pill would work?"

"The Taichu Soul-Returning Pill!" Xue Yue said in a grim tone.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and immediately knew what materials the pill required and what it could do, because the formula for the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill was recorded in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy. He could not help but exclaim, "That is an ancient Spiritual Pill. Your Hengluo Commerce Guild truly has talented people — they even know of such a pill."

Had he not accidentally acquired the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy in the Imperial Garden, he would not have known so many ancient pill formulas.

Yet someone in Hengluo did indeed know; no wonder — they were one of the Star Domain’s three great forces with substantial foundation.

"You knew too?" Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai in surprise, then her eyes brightened and she said, "Right — you are an alchemist!"

Years ago when she had been corroded into unconsciousness by Profound Yin Moon Water, it was Yang Kai who had refined a pill that produced a Pill Cloud and saved her; over the years she had devoted herself to Yang Kai, but had been torn over how to find him and confess her feelings, forgetting his other identity.

Only now did she suddenly wake to it.

But the light in Xue Yue’s eyes soon dimmed again and she said sadly, "The Taichu Soul-Returning Pill is said to be a middle-level Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill; it must be made by a Void King-Grade alchemist to have a chance of success. You may be an alchemist, but..."

Xue Yue did not continue — not because she did not believe in Yang Kai’s abilities, but because Void King-Grade alchemists were staggering in prestige and were vanishingly rare across the entire Star Domain, even more so than those at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Yang Kai, though young, had already reached the Second Stage of the Void King Realm and possessed such powerful Martial Dao cultivation — how could he possibly have extremely high attainments in the Dao of Alchemy?

Yang Kai did not explain much and simply asked, "How does your young wife treat you normally?"

"The young wife was naturally very kind to me. After my mother passed, I grew up at her side... She taught me cultivation, taught me how to be a person, and she even knew my secret. When I was little she would sometimes, behind Father’s back, secretly dress me up..." Xue Yue's lovely eyes shone with recollection, a warm smile blooming on her face as if remembering something sweet. "But every time we were finished, I had to change back at once—Father didn't like seeing me in my feminine form!"

Yang Kai nodded slightly; from Xue Yue’s description he could imagine the young wife was a model of a virtuous wife and good mother.

"I’ll go take a look," Yang Kai suggested.

"You want to go?" Xue Yue looked at him in delighted surprise. "That would be good. You are an alchemist after all; perhaps you can consult with other alchemists to see how to alleviate the young wife’s symptoms. Our Commerce Guild also has a Void King-Grade master they host as a Guest Elder; Father sent someone to invite him more than half a year ago."

"They sent someone half a year ago and he still hasn’t come?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

"You underestimate the stature of Void King-Grade alchemists. Didn’t you hear me? That master in our guild is hosted as a Guest Elder. You have a sect too; you should understand what the words ‘Guest Elder’ imply."

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

The position of Guest Elder was almost equivalent to Grand Elder, only with greater freedom.

Guest Elders accepted extremely generous rewards from a sect or force but had nothing to do in daily affairs; even if the sect were plunged into disaster they could stand aside without reproach.

Grand Elders were different: though their status was equally lofty, an order from them compelled disciples to obey, and they were bound to life and death with the sect — when the sect suffered, a Grand Elder could not stand by.

In some respects the Guest Elder’s position could even surpass the Grand Elder, because a Guest Elder could reap benefits without risking their life.

To put it another way, Grand Elders were family, Guest Elders were hired outsiders.

With the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s immense power and Ai Ou’s prestige, they had sent invitations more than half a year ago and still the master had not appeared — one could imagine how formidable that Void King-Grade alchemist’s stature must be.

Even so, Hengluo dared not complain; Ai Ou only urged cautiously a few times for fear of offending that master.

Yet until today the master had still not appeared; word came instead that he would arrive at Shuiyue Star within the next few days.

Ai Ou waited anxiously and had no mood to meet Shen Tu; this was why Shen Tu had stayed in Shuitian City for several days and then slunk away.

He had not even seen Ai Ou, so he had no time to discuss Yang Kai.

"In any case, let’s go and take a look first," Yang Kai proposed.

"All right, I’ll take you. I’m sure if the young wife knew of your existence she would be happy for me," Xue Yue said, wiping at her eyes, on the verge of tears.

The young wife occupied an extremely important place in her heart, even more so than her biological father.

"Don’t cry; if Shen Tu sees you outside he might wonder what we’re up to," Yang Kai stepped forward and wiped her eyes.

The gentle gesture and his low voice made Xue Yue’s cheeks flush bright red...

The hall’s doors suddenly banged open, and Yang Kai and Xue Yue stepped out one after the other.

Shen Tu and the two others who had been eavesdropping at the door all leapt back and stood, eyeing Yang Kai and Xue Yue with suspicious, dubious expressions.

In the next moment Shen Tu’s heart sank...

He discovered that his Third Brother’s eyes were rimmed with red as if he had been crying, and that enviably handsome face still bore a lingering blush that set imaginations racing...
