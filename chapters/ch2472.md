## Chapter 2472 — Going Deeper

Xiao Baiyi suddenly snorted coldly, "Flirting with a Junior Sister of our Sect right in front of me—do you take me for a deaf man... or a blind one?"

Yang Kai turned his head with a cheerful smile. "Xiao Bai, long time no see."

Xiao Baiyi's face darkened. "I told you, my name is Xiao Baiyi. Xiao! Bai! Yi! Not Xiao Bai!" The veins on his forehead bulged, clearly infuriated by that nickname.

After a brief pause, Xiao Baiyi’s face grew even more serious. “I hear you’re a disciple of the Shrine now. Though you joined later than I did, in the Martial Dao, strength comes first. If you refuse to call me by my full name, at least address me as Junior Brother Xiao. I don’t want to hear you call me ‘Xiao Bai’ ever again!”

"Got it, Junior Brother Xiao Bai!" Yang Kai grinned widely.

Xiao Baiyi’s face turned pale with anger on the spot.

Murong Xiaoxiao, standing to the side, covered her mouth and giggled. "Senior Brother Yang, did you rush over to help us because you saw our message?"

"Message?" Yang Kai frowned, looking at her suspiciously.

Murong Xiaoxiao asked in surprise, "Senior Brother Yang didn’t see it?"

Yang Kai said, "I don’t have your Transmission Beads or Transmission Compass, so how could I see it..."

As he spoke, he suddenly remembered something and quickly took it out from his Spatial Ring.

It was a golden token—the Qingyang Gold Token that Gao Xueting had given him back in Fenglin City. Anyone holding this Qingyang Gold Token was an Elite Disciple of Qingyang Shrine. In the entire Shrine, only a handful of disciples possessed such a token.

But ever since Yang Kai received this Qingyang Gold Token, he had never used it, nor had he ever had the chance to.

Probing it with his Divine Sense, he finally understood what Murong Xiaoxiao meant.

This Qingyang Gold Token actually had the function of a Transmission Compass, allowing disciples to send messages to each other. At this moment, there was a lingering message inside the token—the very distress call Murong Xiaoxiao had sent not long ago.

Seeing his expression, Murong Xiaoxiao knew this was his first time learning about it. She smiled, "Senior Brother Yang, you should check the messages in your Gold Token more often. You never know when a Junior Brother or Junior Sister might leave a message."

"I’ll remember that." Yang Kai nodded and put the Qingyang Gold Token away.

Although he hadn’t noticed Murong Xiaoxiao’s message in time, he had still arrived here by a stroke of luck and managed to save her and Xiao Baiyi.

"Where’s Xia Sheng? Why don’t I see him?" Yang Kai glanced around, asking suspiciously.

Since Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao were together, there was no reason for Xia Sheng not to be here. Yet there was no sign of him anywhere.

Xiao Baiyi said, "Senior Brother left us two months ago. He said he was looking for a place to prepare for a breakthrough."

Yang Kai raised his brows. "Oh? Xia Sheng is about to advance to the Emperor Realm?"

Murong Xiaoxiao looked worried. "Yes, Senior Brother’s cultivation reached the peak of the Dao Origin Realm long ago, but he’s always lacked the opportunity. Coming to the Shattered Star Sea finally triggered his breakthrough, so he hurried off to prepare."

"Then why didn’t you go with him?" Yang Kai frowned.

Since Xia Sheng was about to break through to the Emperor Realm, someone should be there to guard him. Otherwise, if he were ambushed, he’d have no way to resist.

Xiao Baiyi sighed. "He wouldn’t let us. We secretly followed him for a few days, but he used a cicada-shedding–like secret technique to shake us off."

"Shook you off..." Yang Kai’s face darkened. But thinking about Xia Sheng’s personality, it was just the sort of thing he’d do.

So it seemed Xia Sheng wasn’t very confident about breaking through to the Emperor Realm! If he were, he wouldn’t have gone off alone and left his Junior Brother and Junior Sister behind.

It was precisely because he wasn’t confident and feared dying under the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy that he didn’t want Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao to follow, lest they be traumatized by witnessing it.

Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao were both at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. If they developed shadows in their hearts about advancing because of Xia Sheng, they might never break through in the future.

Yang Kai realized this, and so did Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao, which was why both looked anxious and uneasy.

Seeing this, Yang Kai quickly comforted them, "Xia Sheng has a solid foundation. He shouldn’t have much trouble advancing. On my way here, I’ve already seen someone succeed. If others can do it, so can Xia Sheng. Don’t worry too much."

"Let’s hope so." Xiao Baiyi knew there was nothing he could do now but pray for Xia Sheng’s safety.

"Senior Brother Yang, you came here to find a place to refine Origins, right?" Murong Xiaoxiao asked.

"That’s right. I just happened to pass by and noticed something unusual, so I came to take a look."

Murong Xiaoxiao smiled. "This is the famous Origin Sea. Now that you’ve found it, there’s no need to look elsewhere. Senior Brother Yang, stay here and absorb Origin Power with Senior Brother Xiao. There’s just enough room for two people."

"What about you?" Yang Kai asked.

The island was small, just enough for two people. If Yang Kai stayed, Murong Xiaoxiao would have no place.

Murong Xiaoxiao smiled gently. "I’ll stand guard for you two."

Xiao Baiyi said, "We can take turns. That way, one of us can always keep watch and prevent sneak attacks."

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then shook his head. "No, such opportunities are rare. You two should stay here and refine as much as you can. I’ll look elsewhere. If anyone comes looking for trouble, send me a message and I’ll rush over."

Murong Xiaoxiao said, "But there’s no other space left here. That’s why so many people are fighting for territory."

"No space left?" Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Xiao Baiyi added, "There’s basically no space left. We searched for a long time before finally finding this spot, and we were targeted by others the moment we set foot here. If you try to look for another place, it’ll be pointless—unless…"

"Unless what?" Yang Kai looked at him in surprise.

Murong Xiaoxiao bit her red lips. "Unless Senior Brother Yang has the cultivation of the Emperor Realm."

"Why would I need to be in the Emperor Realm?" Yang Kai’s expression grew odd.

Xiao Baiyi explained, "The deeper you go into the Origin Sea, the denser the Origin Power becomes and the easier it is to absorb and refine. So the further in, the higher the cultivators’ realms. Didn’t you notice that those on the outskirts aren’t very strong?"

Yang Kai thought about it and realized it was true, but still asked, "What does that have to do with the Emperor Realm?"

Xiao Baiyi said, "Because in the deepest part, where the Origin Power is thickest, several Emperors have taken over huge areas. Anyone not in the Emperor Realm isn’t allowed near. Many who accidentally wandered in were killed."

"How overbearing!" Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Murong Xiaoxiao said, "There are many spots there and the Origin Power is even denser, but no one dares go. Senior Brother Yang, you mustn’t go there, or you’ll be risking your life."

"I’ll keep that in mind." Yang Kai nodded, not bothering to explain further.

He really wasn’t afraid of newly advanced Emperors. Even Feng Xuan, under the effect of the Soul Descent, had been killed by him. How could these new Emperors in the Shattered Star Sea scare him?

"But I still want to look around. If I really can’t find a spot..." Yang Kai mused, then grinned slyly. "I can always snatch one."

Murong Xiaoxiao and Xiao Baiyi broke out in a cold sweat, but thinking of Yang Kai’s strength, they weren’t too worried.

Yang Kai’s strength seemed to have surpassed the Dao Origin Realm. Otherwise, he couldn’t have blown up that long-faced elder from the Point Star Sect with a single punch.

"Just be careful!" Xiao Baiyi, unable to dissuade him, could only remind him.

"You two be careful as well. If anything happens, send me a message." With that, Yang Kai cupped his fists to them, turned, and sped toward the deepest part of the Origin Sea.

Watching his departing figure, Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao fell silent. After a long while, Xiao Baiyi said, "Let’s hurry and refine, so we don’t miss this opportunity."

Murong Xiaoxiao nodded, and the two of them sat down cross-legged.

As he sped along, Yang Kai took out his Qingyang Gold Token from his Spatial Ring and kept it close.

This way, he could sense any message fluctuations immediately. Before, he’d kept it in his Spatial Ring and couldn’t detect messages from others at all.

The further he went, the denser the Origin Power became.

Yang Kai didn’t know how far he’d flown. He only knew that along the way, he’d seen many Dao Origin Realm cultivators sitting cross-legged on the islands below, refining and absorbing Origin Power.

But at a certain point, he saw no more people. Even though there were still empty islands below, no one occupied them. Instead, on those empty islands lay corpses in miserable states, as if warning those who came after.

Yang Kai understood—this was the handiwork of those Emperors who had seized the best spots. It was bloody, but extremely effective. The dead were the top Dao Origin Realm cultivators of the Star Realm. If even they were left exposed here, anyone coming after would have to think twice about their own strength.

Anyone else would have turned back at such a sight, but Yang Kai ignored it and thundered forward, making no attempt to hide himself.

Suddenly, a wave of Emperor Intent swept over from somewhere below. Though not especially pure or overwhelming, it was still Emperor Intent, resonating with the principles of Heaven and Earth. Yang Kai’s body paused mid-flight, and even his breathing grew labored.

"Trash from the Dao Origin Realm dares come here? Looks like you don’t know the meaning of death." A deep voice rang out, and from somewhere in the Origin Sea below, a giant blood-red palm shot up at Yang Kai.

The palm was not only enormous but reeked of blood, as if formed from fresh gore. The stench was nauseating, and its momentum was ferocious.
