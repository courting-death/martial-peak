## Chapter 1246 — Departure

Within the Nine Heavens Divine Technique there is a move called Supreme Heaven Draw, a soul technique specifically designed to use Divine Sense to control another's spirit; though the Nine Heavens Divine Technique is native to the Tongxuan Continent, Yang Kai's Divine Sense was so formidable that he had no fear of backlash from the Artifact Spirit when he used it.

In no time everything was settled. Yang Kai drew a wisp of the Artifact Spirit's soul-origin out of its shell and sealed it inside his own Sea of Consciousness.

In this way he could monitor the Artifact Spirit's existence at any moment; if the thing ever harbored ill intent, Yang Kai could erase it instantly.

Stripped of a sliver of its soul-origin, the Artifact Spirit seemed displeased; its wings fluttered as it repeatedly cried out toward Yang Kai. He understood its sour mood but did not bother to argue. With a wave he withdrew the layers of Cold Flame from the refining furnace—now that the Artifact Spirit had been subdued, there was no need to keep its container frozen. Freezing the furnace wouldn't fatally harm the Artifact Spirit, but it would have effects.

Seeing its vessel unharmed, the Artifact Spirit's fury calmed considerably, though it still carried a streak of defiance.

Yang Kai considered for a moment, then extended a finger and coaxed a bead of Golden Blood from his fingertip, looking to the Artifact Spirit he said, "Want this?"

The last time the Divine Tree had swallowed two drops of his Golden Blood it immediately fell into a slumber to evolve, and it still had not awakened. Yang Kai understood that Golden Blood aided the Divine Tree; after all, a drop of Golden Blood carried immense life force.

He only wondered whether it would be alluring to an Artifact Spirit; if so, commanding it in future would be far easier.

To Yang Kai's surprise, he had assumed the life-laden Golden Blood would be of little use to an Artifact Spirit. But when the Artifact Spirit saw that bead of Golden Blood, its eyes instantly flashed with a thread of brilliance; it transformed into a streak of firelight and darted to Yang Kai's side.

Yang Kai's Saint Yuan stirred instinctively, but upon sensing that the spirit bore no malice he let his guard fall.

The firelight simply flickered around Yang Kai's hand and the bead of Golden Blood vanished without a trace. Immediately thereafter, not far off, the Artifact Spirit's body reappeared—where it had looked dim and grievously depleted of Yuan Qi, it now recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye, regaining much in a short while.

Yang Kai watched dumbfounded.

He had produced a drop of Golden Blood because it was his most precious asset and he had wanted to test it. He did not expect it to actually help the Artifact Spirit.

Then it dawned on him. Although the Artifact Spirit had no flesh, its container that birthed it was a dead thing; yet because its intelligence had awakened, it was no ordinary Artifact Spirit. If the connection to its container was severed and it found a suitable body to usurp, it could become a unique being.

It possessed its own life force, so Golden Blood would naturally affect it as well.

After swallowing the drop of Golden Blood the Artifact Spirit only restored some Yuan Qi and showed no other obvious change in power; it cocked its head and circled Yang Kai, behaving obsequiously as if hoping to coax another drop of Golden Blood from him.

Yang Kai couldn't help but laugh inwardly. He realized this Artifact Spirit's intelligence was indeed extraordinary. No wonder—an Artifact Spirit that had existed for tens of thousands of years could reasonably be expected to possess such spirit; if it had not, Yang Kai would never have expended so much effort to wrestle it.

"No more Golden Blood, but there's this."

Yang Kai casually tossed out an object—a bean-sized Crystal Stone. Golden Blood was too precious to squander, whereas this Crystal Stone had likely come from some Sixth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast; his Spatial Ring held plenty more, so he did not begrudge giving it away.

At the sight of the Crystal Stone the Artifact Spirit turned into firelight again, enveloped the stone, and when it reappeared the Crystal Stone was gone without a trace.

It clicked its beak in a dissatisfied manner; the Artifact Spirit seemed somewhat displeased.

Anyone who had gorged on a feast would react the same way when offered plain fare.

"All right, go back to your container. I should be leaving." Yang Kai had no intention of giving it anything more; he had not fully tamed the Artifact Spirit—only the Divine Sense restriction forced it to obey. He was not nearly as munificent with it as he had been with the Divine Tree.

At Yang Kai's command, the Artifact Spirit did not immediately comply; it cried out sharply, then transformed into a streak of fire and began to fly circles around the four stone pedestals inside the chamber.

Yang Kai frowned. Through the special connection between them he finally understood its meaning and hesitated, "You want me to extract the earthfire again?"

The Artifact Spirit circled once and alighted—Yang Kai had guessed correctly.

"Fine."

Yang Kai did not delay. He unleashed Saint Yuan into the four pedestals, activating the great formation in the chamber. In an instant a continuous stream of earthfire was drawn from the Earth-Lung Fire Pool beneath and poured into the refining furnace.

The Artifact Spirit, however, flashed and dove straight into the underground, intent on some unknown purpose.

Yang Kai was not worried it would flee—aside from the Divine Sense seal, its container still lay here.

Moments later his face changed. Fixing his attention on the furnace he realized that because of whatever the Artifact Spirit had done below, the earthfire drawn out had suddenly intensified severalfold, and the chamber's seals showed signs of strain.

All that earthfire poured into the refining furnace, making it shudder as though about to explode.

At the same time, streams of runes flowed across the furnace, chain-like energy bands appearing leisurely along its surface.

Yang Kai paused in surprise.

He had seen such energy bands before—over a month earlier, when the Artifact Spirit pursued him, similar bands had appeared in the outer passage and had broken the Artifact Spirit's body, enabling his escape.

Seeing them again now, Yang Kai instantly understood.

This refining furnace had been bound by a seal, locked within this chamber.

If so, then the Artifact Spirit must have been born tens of thousands of years ago. The furnace's original owner had used this method to lock the furnace in place, preventing the Artifact Spirit from breaking free—otherwise, given its abilities, the Artifact Spirit could have simply carried the furnace out of the Earth-Lung Fire Pool instead of remaining lonely here for millennia.

Realizing this, Yang Kai forced a wry smile; if he wanted to take the furnace with him he would first have to break that seal.

The Artifact Spirit clearly could not dispel the restriction itself, or it would have fled long ago instead of being trapped here.

He hadn't expected to end up doing the hard work for it after getting no real aid from the spirit—Yang Kai cursed his luck inwardly.

A red light flashed from underground and the Artifact Spirit reappeared, crying toward the layers of seals on the furnace. Yang Kai understood and did not hesitate; he surged Cold Flame again, striking at the energy chains.

Though the seals were cunningly designed and very sturdy, they were still dead constructs. Yang Kai's Cold Flame, being counter to them, made cracking them far from impossible.

Half a day later, under the continual freezing of the Cold Flame, the chain-like energy bands finally fractured inch by inch.

The Artifact Spirit, which had been hovering nearby, cried out brightly with boundless joy and leapt into the furnace.

In an instant the container and the Artifact Spirit fused; a burst of Spiritual Qi from the fire spirit erupted so fiercely that Yang Kai's expression changed.

He then understood that the Artifact Spirit had been unable to fully demonstrate its strength because of that seal; otherwise the outcome of their earlier encounter might have been uncertain.

In that respect he owed thanks to the furnace's original owner—for the seal had given him the chance to subdue the Artifact Spirit.

Just as he was lost in thought, the great refining furnace slowly rose into the air, spinning and shrinking rapidly.

Before long the giant furnace dwindled to the size of a palm, minuscule.

With a flash the small furnace flew before Yang Kai; from its brazier a crimson, fiery silhouette flashed into being and vanished.

Yang Kai inhaled and tucked the tiny brazier into his Spatial Ring.

He did not place it into the Black Book Space—there were too many precious things there and the Artifact Spirit did not seem trustworthy; he could not be certain something wouldn't be lost.

After pocketing the furnace, Yang Kai removed the eight glowing spheres embedded in the stone walls and tossed them into his Spatial Ring as well, then strolled out of the chamber.

There was no longer any reason to linger; he had cleared the chambers beneath the Earth-Lung Fire Pool and everything of value was now his.

Remaining would only waste time.

Soon Yang Kai arrived at the cave mouth and looked up at the scarcely visible exit, feeling a touch of difficulty.

The place was at least several thousand zhang from the exit, and the Earth-Lung Fire Pool's molten eruptions were prone to sudden bursts. Climbing up would be troublesome and might be dangerous.

Thinking it over, Yang Kai brightened and once more produced the refining furnace.

He remembered the Artifact Spirit had been able to fly inside the chamber—though its flight had been confined to within the room, it seemed not wholly bound by the local laws of heaven and earth.

After a moment's communication Yang Kai was elated; the Artifact Spirit indeed could fly out directly. He did not hesitate to let it carry him.

Moments later a red beam burst up at a spot on the Fifth Layer's surface, and beneath that blaze Yang Kai, Cold Flame swirling about his hands, gripped the Artifact Spirit's claws and followed it upward.

Once they broke free of the Earth-Lung Fire Pool the Artifact Spirit let out a high, triumphant cry as if newly saved, and it tried to spread its wings and fly.

But it had only risen ten zhang before its body halted and it crashed down, rolling in the dirt and looking battered. Yang Kai understood at once that the Artifact Spirit was not entirely free of this place's heavenly constraints—only that those constraints were far looser than his own.
