## Chapter 2281 — Kid, You’ve Got Nice Muscles

“It’s not that I’m unwilling to help—it’s just that there’s too much going on, and I can’t be everywhere at once. Didn’t I already tell you I’d go when I had the time?” Yang Kai explained.

Ye Qinghan hesitated for a moment before biting her lip and saying, "To be honest with you, Young Master Yang, in the secret realm of my Chiyue Sect, there is a place called Emperor Heaven Valley. If one can cultivate there for some time, it will greatly help with advancement to the Emperor Realm."

Yang Kai gave her a knowing smile.

Ye Qinghan’s pretty face flushed red. “It’s not that I don’t trust Young Master Yang, it’s just that this matter is extremely important. I dare not reveal it carelessly, or it will attract countless Dao Origin Realm cultivators’ covetous eyes. My Chiyue Sect is not strong enough to resist them.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Emperor Heaven Valley is a good name, very imposing. But… what does that have to do with me?”

Ye Qinghan stomped her foot. “If Young Master Yang can really repair the Space Array and restore the secret realm to the Chiyue Sect, I can guarantee you entry!”

“Your status in the Chiyue Sect…” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at her.

Ye Qinghan said, “I am the daughter of the Chiyue Sect Master! The current Sect Master of the Chiyue Sect, Ye Hen, is my father!”

“So you’re the Young Sect Master.” Yang Kai cupped his fists. “I truly apologize for my disrespect.”

Ye Qinghan’s face turned even redder. “Young Master Yang is making fun of me.”

To be honest, Ye Qinghan never thought her identity as the Young Sect Master of Chiyue Sect was anything special. After all, even the Young Palace Master of Fei Sheng Palace had been beaten into a pig’s head by Yang Kai—so what was her status worth in front of him? That was why she hadn’t planned to reveal it at first.

But now she had no choice. Otherwise, she couldn’t earn Yang Kai’s trust.

“Young Master Yang, I beg you…” Ye Qinghan’s tone was sincere, her expression mournful. “My father is getting old. If he can’t break through to the Emperor Realm soon, he may not have many years left. But advancing is no easy feat, and Emperor Heaven Valley is his greatest opportunity. It’s also our best hope. If you can help my Chiyue Sect this time, I’ll agree to any request you make.”

As she spoke, she looked as if she was ready to risk everything, making Yang Kai take notice.

Yang Kai fell silent. Ye Qinghan didn’t dare breathe, standing there with her red lips pressed together, her heart pounding anxiously in the quiet room. The sound of her heartbeat echoed in her chest.

After a long while, Yang Kai finally sighed and said, “Fine, for the sake of your filial piety, I’ll go with you.”

“Really?” Ye Qinghan was overjoyed, tears of happiness streaming down her face as she looked at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“But not right now. You know there’s still some business in Fenglin City. Once things are settled here, we’ll set out.”

“No rush, no rush.” Ye Qinghan quickly waved her hand. “I’ve waited so many years already, I’m not in a hurry.”

“But let me be clear.” Yang Kai looked at her seriously. “I can only promise to try. I can’t guarantee I’ll be able to repair the Space Array.”

“Just hearing that from you is enough!”

“Go find a place to rest. I’ll let you know when it’s time to leave.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Ye Qinghan said, “Then I’ll await your good news.”

After saying that, she gathered her robes, bowed gracefully, and left, thoughtfully closing the door behind her.

Once she was gone, Yang Kai sighed and sat down, muttering to himself, “Another troublesome matter.”

He had no relation to Ye Qinghan, nor any connection to the Chiyue Sect, so he naturally didn’t want to get involved. But Ye Qinghan was truly persistent. Yang Kai felt that if he didn’t agree, she’d probably chase him to the ends of the earth, making things even more troublesome.

If that really happened, having a young married woman following him around all day, looking at him with a mournful face, anyone who didn’t know the situation would think he’d abandoned her. What a mess that would be.

Still, the so-called Emperor Heaven Valley Ye Qinghan mentioned did pique Yang Kai’s interest. Since it could help cultivators break through to the Emperor position, it must be related to comprehending the Martial Dao. Although Yang Kai was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, gaining more insight into the Martial Dao would only benefit his growth. With the Supreme Mystic Pill, his future advancement to the Emperor Realm would be smooth.

For a while, the room was silent. Yang Kai sat cross-legged, cultivating quietly until midnight.

Having just advanced to the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he naturally needed to consolidate his cultivation.

As night fell, Yang Kai pushed open the door and stepped out. In a flicker of movement, he arrived at the City Lord’s Mansion within a dozen breaths.

The guards outside the City Lord’s Mansion were nothing to him.

But as he entered the mansion, Yang Kai suddenly felt a chill on his skin. Several powerful Divine Senses swept over his body and vanished in an instant.

Though it lasted only a moment, it made him shudder and break out in a cold sweat.

Those Divine Senses belonged to genuine Emperor Realm experts—clearly, Xiao Yuyang and the others were all staying in the mansion.

Most of the Divine Senses just checked him briefly and withdrew, but one lingered, faintly guiding him.

Yang Kai sniffed and followed the direction of that Divine Sense. Soon, he arrived outside a side room. He raised his hand, but before he could knock, Gao Xueting’s voice came from inside: “Come in!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai pushed the door open and entered.

He saw Gao Xueting sitting cross-legged on the bed, her bright eyes fixed on him.

Yang Kai grinned, “Greetings, Elder Gao. I didn’t expect that after parting last time, we’d meet again here in Fenglin City… Uh, Elder Gao, what are you doing?”

Before he could finish, Gao Xueting waved her hand. Origin Qi surged, the door slammed shut, and an invisible barrier enveloped the room, isolating it from the outside.

“So cautious, even setting up a barrier?” A dissatisfied voice sounded from another room. Xiao Yuyang opened his eyes and muttered playfully, “What’s that girl up to? I wanted to see what’s so special about that kid, but now it’s ruined.”

Meanwhile, in the rooms where the other Emperor Realm experts were staying, everyone was clicking their tongues, clearly having tried to spy on Gao Xueting’s room, only to be blocked by the barrier.

In an instant, the side room was completely isolated.

Gulp…

Yang Kai swallowed nervously, a sense of foreboding spreading in his heart.

“Take off your clothes!” Gao Xueting looked at Yang Kai expressionlessly and ordered.

“Huh?” Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. “Th-this… isn’t this a bit inappropriate?”

“Stop babbling!” Gao Xueting snorted coldly. Seeing Yang Kai hesitate, she grew impatient. Without any visible movement, she suddenly appeared before him, reached out, and grabbed him.

Yang Kai felt that slender jade hand instantly transform into a five-fingered mountain, enveloping him. He couldn’t pull away.

The next moment, his neck tightened as Gao Xueting lifted him up.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai spun around under an external force. As he spun, his clothes quickly came off and flew away. In an instant, he was left in only his underwear.

“Elder Gao… please stop!” Yang Kai screamed miserably.

Gao Xueting ignored him, reached out and made him stop spinning, then pinched her fingers like an orchid, her movements swift as the wind. She tapped several key acupoints on Yang Kai’s body, her beautiful eyes flashing as she closely observed the changes in him.

Her bright eyes swept over every part of Yang Kai’s body, examining him thoroughly from head to toe.

After a while, she nodded slightly. “Good, nothing major.”

As she finished speaking, Yang Kai suddenly felt the force restraining him disappear completely.

He rolled and crawled onto Gao Xueting’s bed, wrapped himself in the blanket, shivering and looking utterly shaken.

Gao Xueting sneered, “Feeling shy now?”

Yang Kai’s face was pale, his mouth twitching. “Elder Gao, what exactly are you doing?”

Only now did he understand why Gao Xueting set up the barrier. If anyone saw this scene, not even the waters of all the rivers and lakes could wash away the scandal.

Gao Xueting said seriously, “Your cultivation has progressed too quickly. Not long ago you were at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and now you’re at the Second Stage. I was just checking for any hidden dangers. What did you think I was doing?”

As she spoke, a cold light flashed in Gao Xueting’s eyes, making Yang Kai shiver.

“If it’s just a check, you didn’t have to do it this way…” Yang Kai said miserably.

“If it were only that, of course not. But I heard that an Artifact Spirit appeared today and chased after you. I needed to make sure you haven’t been corrupted by Demonic Qi.”

“I’m not that young anymore, you know. I’m not a child.”

“I’m old enough to be your great-grandmother! What’s the harm in checking your body?” Gao Xueting smirked, “Kid, you’ve got nice muscles. Looks like your physique is pretty good.”

“Elder Gao, you flatter me…” Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead awkwardly. “So, what’s the result?”

“The result is pretty good.” Gao Xueting said, reaching out and grabbing all of Yang Kai’s clothes, tossing them back to him. “Your advancement was fast, but your foundation is solid, and there’s no sign of Demonic Qi corruption.”

Yang Kai asked timidly, “If I had been corrupted by Demonic Qi… what would happen?”

“Then you’d be dead already!” Gao Xueting’s phoenix eyes turned cold as she looked at him. “So, do you have anything to tell me?”

“No, no, absolutely not!” Yang Kai waved his hands frantically, secretly resolving never to let Gao Xueting know that the Demonic Intent was sealed inside him, or that the Demonic Warhammer was in his possession.

“Kid, you’re hiding something, aren’t you?” Gao Xueting’s voice turned cold.

Yang Kai forced a bitter smile. “There’s nothing, Elder Gao, you’re mistaken.”

Gao Xueting stared deeply at Yang Kai for a long time before saying, “That’s best. If I find out you’re hiding something, you’ll regret it.”

Yang Kai didn’t dare make a sound, hurriedly putting on his clothes under the blanket.
