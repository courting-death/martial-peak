## Chapter 1394 — Dominant Spectators

Wei Guchang froze, staring at Fei Zhi Tu in astonishment, not understanding what he meant.

Fei Zhi Tu let out a cold laugh. “You really think those people from Tianluo Hall inside the palace have gone out on some mission? With our Yingyue Hall surrounded by threats on all sides, countless powers watching us, and the Imperial Garden possibly opening at any moment—at such a sensitive time, what kind of mission could they possibly be carrying out? Aren’t they afraid that acting rashly would give others an excuse to seize upon their mistakes?”

At Fei Zhi Tu’s words, Wei Guchang's eyes lit up. “The City Lord means…?”

He had heard talk that many experts from Tianluo Hall had been mobilized, so upon hearing Fei Zhi Tu speak he instantly made some connections.

“Use your head when you act, you’ve still got a long way to go, young man!” Fei Zhi Tu snorted, then drained the cup at a single swallow.

Wei Guchang scratched at his ears and cheeks for a while, embarrassed, and looked apologetically at Qian Tong. Suddenly his expression turned grave and he bowed deeply: “Forgive me, Elder — this disciple misunderstood you.”

“Ha ha ha!” Qian Tong laughed loudly. “Standing up for a friend, even daring to oppose an old man’s wishes—no pretense, no hypocrisy. Good, good, you’ve not disappointed me. Come, fill Old Fei’s cup; today I’ll enjoy the show right here!”

“Yes!” Wei Guchang hurried forward, lifted the wine jug and filled a cup for each elder, then stepped aside with his hands folded, exchanging a glance with Xuan'er. Gone were the earlier anxiety and worry; both of them were now calm.

The Tianluo Hall is a special formation within Yingyue Hall, small in number—only about fifty or sixty—but each member is elite. The weakest among them is at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, the highest only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. But because of the particular cultivation methods and martial skill they practice, each man can fight above his rank, and they specialize in coordinated strikes; the more who join, the greater their combined power.

If the entire Tianluo Hall were to join forces, even a straight fight against the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would not be a problem.

So when Wei Guchang heard that the Tianluo Hall had been mobilized, he no longer had any real worries. Leaving aside the finesse of Dragon Lair Mountain’s guardian formation, Tianluo Hall alone was enough to teach those despicable scoundrels a lesson.

That said… the elder’s action carried tremendous risk. If someone with intent spotted the clue, it could very well once again push Yingyue Hall into the eye of the storm and invite gossip.

The emergence of the Imperial Garden had already left Yingyue Hall in a precarious position.

Elsewhere, on a desolate hillock some dozens of li from Dragon Lair Mountain, an elderly man with a ruddy face and white hair stood with his hands folded behind his back, gazing toward Dragon Lair Mountain with an impassive expression. From him radiated a powerful Qi and blood fluctuation that made onlookers shrink back.

Beside him stood a hunched old woman, leaning on a dragon‑headed cane, appearing frail and coughing from time to time as if her life could end at any moment. A flowerlike young woman tended to her, supporting her arm; the wind lifted the young woman’s hair, creating a striking contrast between the two.

The old man was none other than Demon Blood Sect elder Jin Shi, and the old woman was Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain.

Two top Origin Returning Realm experts had gathered here. It was easy to understand why: both of them were plotting to seize the Xuan Gold in Yang Kai's possession, so naturally they kept a close watch on Dragon Lair Mountain. If Dragon Lair Mountain fell and Yang Kai were killed, they would immediately move to seize the Xuan Gold.

For the moment, however, they could not conveniently use their strength to bully the weak.

After all, this was still Yingyue Hall’s territory. If they made a move, Yingyue Hall might very well interfere and stir trouble.

“Senior Sister Feng, would you reconsider Jin’s earlier proposal? If you give up that Xuan Gold, Jin will in his lifetime complete three things for you,” Jin Shi suddenly said.

“Hmph!” Old Woman Feng planted her cane in the ground and sneered, “Old Ghost Jin, there’s no need to call me so affectionately. Myriad Beasts Mountain has never had dealings with your Demon Blood Sect, so what Senior Sister or Junior Brother are you talking about? Still, if you can give up that Xuan Gold, I can likewise in my lifetime do three things for you.”

She returned the terms exactly as they had been offered.

After all, everyone knew such verbal promises carried no binding force; the Xuan Gold itself was the greatest prize.

Jin Shi’s eyes narrowed in displeasure, but after a moment he let out a light laugh. “Senior Sister Feng, why push me away? As far as I know, your years are no few either—who knows how long you have left? What could you possibly accomplish for me?”

“So what? At least I’ll outlive you!”

“Hah… arguing about lifespan here is pointless,” Jin Shi said, suddenly finding the bickering childish. His eyes flicked and he continued, “Very well, why don’t we settle this with a contest—whoever wins takes the Xuan Gold. Senior Sister Feng, what do you say?”

“As if I fear you!” Old Woman Feng’s crooked spine straightened in an instant, and an astonishing warlike intent surfaced on her ancient face. She sneered, “I’ve been wanting to test the might of your Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art!”

As they spoke, an overwhelming pressure bore down toward each other; it was clear a fight would erupt at the slightest provocation. True to her name, Old Woman Feng—though aged in appearance—had been hot‑blooded in her youth, and in her twilight years that temperament had not diminished, perhaps even grown worse.

Jin Shi, as a Demon Blood Sect elder who cultivated the Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art, possessed an extraordinarily vigorous Qi and blood and a similarly bad temper. As another top Origin Returning Realm expert, he would not show weakness either; in an instant he met her with his own momentum.

Invisible shocks thundered out in all directions. The disciples behind them showed horror and retreated in unison.

Only the young girl supporting the old woman staggered, then steadied herself with a flash of light, though her face had gone slightly pale from being swept up in the vortex of the two great experts’ momentum.

“Grandma, Elder Jin, please both calm down.” The girl brushed a lock of hair behind her ear and smiled helplessly. “The guardian formation of Dragon Lair Mountain has not yet been broken. If the two of you fight over the Xuan Gold now and word gets out, it will be a pain for kin and a joy for enemies. Moreover, the two of you are both top experts on Dark Star; if you truly fought it might not be decided quickly, would it?”

Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng of course knew this, but both were bad‑tempered and unwilling to back down. Hearing her words, Jin Shi took advantage of the moment and laughed heartily. “You little girl speak well. What is your name?”

With that he reined in his aura.

The girl’s expression brightened and she bowed gracefully. “Disciple Feng Yan.”

“Feng Yan?” Jin Shi frowned and glanced at Old Woman Feng, who snorted coldly: “This is my granddaughter. Don’t set your sights on her, or I’ll make you suffer.”

Jin Shi showed a trace of embarrassment and coughed lightly. “If she’s a junior, why would I set my sights on her? No wonder the little girl’s cultivation is not poor—she has Senior Sister Feng guiding her. Well then, little one, tell me: if I do not duel Senior Sister Feng, how will the Xuan Gold’s ownership be decided? Since you’ve spoken up, you must have a plan—out with it.”

Feng Yan smiled faintly. “Before Elder Jin, this junior dare not show off.”

“Speak up; if you’re wrong I won’t hold it against you. Don’t be afraid,” Jin Shi said kindly.

Feng Yan glanced at Old Woman Feng and then spoke up boldly. “If that is the case, I’ll speak plainly. Both Senior Sister and Elder Jin are masters; it is not fitting for them to fight each other. If one of you suffers a mishap, it will pit the two sects against each other. Now that the Imperial Garden has appeared and no one knows when it might open, at such a time it is better to have more friends than enemies.”

Jin Shi nodded slightly, clearly finding Feng Yan’s words sensible. Even Old Woman Feng’s expression softened and her anger eased.

“The two of you should not fight, but both Myriad Beasts Mountain and Demon Blood Sect have disciples taking part in the assault on Dragon Lair Mountain. Let their methods decide the Xuan Gold’s ownership. If Demon Blood Sect disciples seize the Xuan Gold, Myriad Beasts Mountain will willingly withdraw and wish Elder Jin great success!”

Jin Shi's lips curved in a half‑smirk as he regarded Feng Yan. “You are so confident in your Myriad Beasts Mountain disciples?”

Feng Yan pressed her lips together and smiled. “Would Elder Jin have no confidence in the methods of his own disciples?”

Jin Shi narrowed his eyes, then after a moment laughed out loud. “Little girl, don’t try to provoke me. Of course I have full faith in my disciples’ methods. Fine—one question: does what you say represent Senior Sister Feng?”

“What Yan says is what I mean!” Old Woman Feng tapped her dragon‑headed cane and said in a deep voice.

“It’s settled!” Jin Shi snorted, reaching out a palm. Old Woman Feng glanced and lazily raised her own palm to meet his. After they clapped palms in oath, neither spoke further; instead they turned to stare into the distance, strange smiles at the corners of their mouths.

Both clearly had complete confidence in their disciples.

The siege of Dragon Lair Mountain was observed not only by Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu, Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng from afar, but also by scattered onlookers standing on vantage points dozens to hundreds of li away, watching toward Dragon Lair Mountain and pointing from time to time.

The auction at Jubao Tower had only just ended, and the experts who had attended had not yet left. They wanted to take the chance to observe the Imperial Garden’s movements. Since the Imperial Garden had been quiet, waiting for it to open was dull; now that such a spectacle had unfolded, anyone would be willing to watch and treat it as entertainment.
