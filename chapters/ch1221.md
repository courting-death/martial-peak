## Chapter 1221 — Each on Their Own

Hearing Daiyuan say that, the other three quickened their pace without thinking.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er then began asking about that wondrous sight of Three Suns Rising, and Yang Kai pretended to be very interested, listening at their side.

After Daiyuan's explanation, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er finally understood what the Three Suns Rising phenomenon was, but Yang Kai's expression grew odd.

He realized that although Daiyuan had recognized the Red Candle Fruit and knew of the Three Suns Rising phenomenon, she seemed not to understand everything...

He didn't know whether the others were the same, but Yang Kai was certain it wasn't only him and Daiyuan who recognized the Red Candle Fruit; the most elite among Dark Star had gathered on the Third Layer, and surely others would recognize it.

Two full hours later, the four arrived at a valley. The valley was small, roughly a hundred zhang across. The ground below was a dark red earth, split by countless fissures and ravines. Strangely, some withered trees grew within the valley; they too were reddish, appearing lifeless, yet a closer inspection revealed they were clearly not dead. Some peculiar force kept them clinging to life in this harsh land.

Around the valley rose numerous small hills, at least twenty or so.

When Yang Kai and the others arrived, about half of those hills already had people standing on them. These people, representing their respective Sects, occupied the little mounds as footholds.

Most cultivators' gazes wandered among the stunted trees in the valley, eyes filled with longing and burning desire. Strangely though, not a single person ventured deep into the valley; whatever they feared remained unknown.

As Yang Kai and his group stepped in, countless eyes swept over them. Many showed vigilance and disgust; after all, a heaven-defying spirit fruit nearing maturity meant fewer intruders would be preferable.

Yet everyone knew that wish was unrealistic. Before the Red Candle Fruit matured, the rising red sun spectacle had already set the entire Third Layer ablaze. No doubt everyone was hurrying this way. So despite their wariness and dislike, they could do nothing; they only glanced once at Yang Kai and the others, then withdrew their gazes.

Yang Kai swept his eyes over the scene, his heart chilled.

This scene was truly grand. There were plenty of people, and each of them was an elite from a major force.

He saw people from the Battle Sky Alliance, from Leitai Sect, from Liuli Sect. He saw other promising young talents he didn't know. In total there were at least seventy or eighty people.

The four of them had arrived relatively late; surely more were still on their way, and by then things would be even more chaotic.

Yang Kai also spotted that aloof martial artist who had previously occupied the very center of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water. That fellow arrogantly monopolized a small hill, indifferent to others, hands behind his back, expression as cold as ever, standing straight as a sword. No one dared to provoke him.

Most who came could guess the man's identity and kept their distance; though they disliked his manner, no one dared to speak up.

As for Liuli Sect, when Yin Sudie saw Daiyuan she looked strange, as if surprised her Senior Sister would be traveling with others; but upon recognizing Xuan'er she relaxed and promptly ignored Daiyuan, showing no intention to greet her.

Wei Guchang glanced around, then pointed to a barely noticed small hill and said, "Let's go there."

Soon the four ascended that mound and, like the others, fixed their gaze on the valley below, observing intently.

"Where's the Red Candle Fruit?" Wei Guchang scanned the valley but found no trace of the spirit fruit—only countless dead trees, leaving him utterly astonished.

"The Red Candle Fruit can't be seen before it matures," Daiyuan said slowly, shaking her head. "But it's definitely somewhere in this valley. When it matures, it will naturally rise to the surface."

"I see!" Wei Guchang nodded slightly.

“Hm? Senior Brother Li Younan from the Medicine Pill Sect is coming this way,” Dong Xuan’er murmured softly, glancing into the distance. There, a martial artist dressed in green robes and a jade belt—refined in appearance, looking every bit the scholarly gentleman—was speeding toward them. Before he even arrived, he smiled and raised a hand in greeting.

Yang Kai had heard of the Medicine Pill Sect.

In every place there were Sects or powers that made a living crafting pills. Zhongdu had Yao Wang Valley; on Tongxuan Continent there was the Alchemists' Association; on Dark Star the most famous was the Medicine Pill Sect.

Such existences were not to be offended casually, for one might need them someday.

Within Medicine Pill Sect there were five Origin-Grade Lower-Level alchemists—unrivaled on Dark Star. Each was a master renowned across the star and revered wherever they went.

That Li Younan, able to penetrate to the Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland, was surely one of Medicine Pill Sect's elites. He seemed to know Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, though how close their relations were was unknown.

Before long, the scholar-like Li Younan arrived at the hill where the four stood. He cupped his hands and smiled to Wei Guchang, genial and warm: "Brother Wei, so you came after all."

Wei Guchang returned the salute and laughed, "One must attend such events to stir the pot."

Beside him, Dong Xuan’er and Daiyuan both offered polite greetings to Li Younan. Li Younan returned their courtesy with a gentle smile, his manner refined and cultured. He then asked casually about Yang Kai’s origins and name, but Wei Guchang brushed the question aside with just a few words.

Li Younan found it odd that someone at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm would come here, but since Wei Guchang had brought him, he did not press further.

"Brother Li, what brings you to find Wei here?" Wei Guchang asked bluntly, eyes half-closed.

Li Younan smiled, assuming a mysterious air. "Brother Wei, since you came after seeing the omen, do you know something here is about to emerge?"

"I've heard it's the Red Candle Fruit," Wei Guchang replied.

Li Younan's brow lifted in surprise, but when he glanced at Daiyuan he suddenly understood and slapped his forehead. "I've asked a foolish question. With Miss Daiyuan here, Brother Wei must know—there are few strange herbs or fruits Miss Daiyuan doesn't recognize."

"Senior Brother Li flatters me; I merely have some knowledge," Daiyuan answered calmly.

"Heh, Miss Daiyuan need not be modest. Few could identify the Red Candle Fruit. I told Brother Qu of Battle Sky Alliance, Brother Fang of Leitai Sect, and Miss Yin of Liuli Sect. That's why they held back; with their tempers they'd have swept the valley clean long ago."

Wei Guchang suddenly understood why everyone stood on the surrounding hills and did nothing—Li Younan had informed each arriving power.

His actions were not born of goodwill; where a treasure lay, everyone coveted it, and Li Younan was no exception.

He informed others clearly to prevent rash actions that might disturb the Red Candle Fruit's maturation. If someone ignorant interfered and caused it to vanish, that would be the greatest loss.

So though somewhat reluctant, Li Younan busied himself running between the hills to inform the arriving cultivators of the situation.

"Brother Li truly cares for the world, benefiting all—Wei admires you!" Wei Guchang exclaimed with mock sincerity, repeatedly cupping his hands.

The praise was a bit excessive, and Li Younan hastily waved his hand, saying he didn’t dare accept such credit. Changing the topic, he finally revealed his true purpose: “I wonder if Brother Wei would be interested in joining forces with my Medicine Pill Sect?”

"Join forces?" Wei Guchang's eyes narrowed further and he chuckled. "Brother Li, though I am not versed in pharmaceutics, surely there is only one Red Candle Fruit—how would we join forces? If one of us obtains it, how will it be divided?"

"Listen to me first," Li Younan said as if expecting this objection, unfazed and composed.

"Speak, I'm all ears," Wei Guchang said. Although he suspected Li's motive, he couldn't refuse—offending Medicine Pill Sect would bring no benefit.

"My idea is: first obtain the Red Candle Fruit. Though only one in number, if used in pill-making it might produce more than a single pill," Li Younan explained, watching Wei Guchang's reaction. "As far as I know, your Yingyue Hall only has one Origin-Grade Lower-Level alchemist, and that alchemist is newly promoted with low success rates for Origin-Grade pills. If Brother Wei takes the fruit back, the elders may consume it directly and its medicinal efficacy would be greatly reduced."

Pausing, Li Younan's face showed pride. "This is not unique to Yingyue Hall; other great Sects are the same. But my Medicine Pill Sect is different—we have five Origin-Grade Lower-Level alchemists. If our elders cooperated, perhaps we could refine a dozen or so pills from the Red Candle Fruit."

Hearing this, Wei Guchang finally understood. He looked askance at Li Younan and said, "You mean Medicine Pill Sect should take the Red Candle Fruit, then refine pills and give Yingyue Hall a share?"

"Exactly—that's my idea!" Li Younan nodded repeatedly. "I proposed the same to Brother Qu of Battle Sky Alliance, Brother Fang of Leitai Sect, Miss Yin of Liuli Sect, Brother Qu of Shuangxin Valley, Brother Tang of Piaomiao Hall, and others."

"And their response?" Wei Guchang's brows rose.

"Heh, they haven't given their answers yet, but I believe I can persuade them," Li Younan said with full confidence.
