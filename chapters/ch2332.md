## Chapter 2332 — Ye Chong

The power of the Four Seasons is a divine ability comprehended by the Great Emperor of Time. When this ability is unleashed, the seasons cycle, and the world transforms as the sea turns into mulberry fields. This is a Law Power of time, completely different from the Spatial Law comprehended by Yang Kai.

However, just like the Spatial Law, the Law of Time is extremely esoteric and difficult to comprehend. Any cultivator who can achieve mastery in such powers will surely attain great accomplishments.

Yang Kai had thought the Great Emperor of Time only mastered the Four Seasons divine ability, but now he realized he had been mistaken. The Great Emperor truly grasped the essence of the Law of Time, far surpassing the Four Seasons.

That Emperor Extinction Pill was a treasure refined by the Great Emperor of Time during his Third Stage Emperor Realm days. A single strike from the Emperor Extinction Pill was equivalent to a blow personally delivered by the Great Emperor of Time at his peak. Even a true Third Stage Emperor Realm master would have no hope of surviving such an attack.

This Law of Time can make one experience the passage of an extremely long period in an instant. If used on a living person, wouldn’t the power of time wash over them and instantly age them?

For example, he had just experienced several years of cultivation in a brief moment, breaking through from the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to the Third Stage. This was real accumulation of time; though in reality it was only the blink of an eye, in Yang Kai’s consciousness several years had passed.

Yang Kai could hardly imagine how powerful the Great Emperor of Time was at his peak.

As he pondered, he suddenly became excited.

Because back in the Four Seasons Land, he had obtained three beads: the Spring Bead, the Summer Bead, and the Autumn Bead. According to his speculation at the time, there should have been a Winter Bead as well, but the trial in the Four Seasons Land ended too abruptly, and he never learned where the Winter Bead was, nor could he search for it.

Now it seemed that all three beads carried a trace of the power of time. If he could gather all the Four Seasons Beads, perhaps he could recreate the Great Emperor of Time’s divine ability and inherit his legacy!

The Great Emperor of Time’s legacy is different from the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s. Yang Kai never dared to cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, and after obtaining it, he handed it over to his Incarnation. As it turned out, this was the right decision. According to the Incarnation, although the Heaven Devouring Battle Art is incredibly powerful, it also has severe side effects. If not for the Incarnation’s unique body, able to refine all kinds of impurities and cleanse negative influences, he would have long been constrained by the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

But if he could obtain the Great Emperor of Time’s legacy, the benefits to Yang Kai would be immeasurable. By comprehending the Law of Time and mastering the power of the Four Seasons, Yang Kai could reach higher realms in less time, because under the Law of Time, one year of his cultivation might equal ten or even a hundred years for others!

Yang Kai’s heart burned with excitement.

But the thought that the Winter Bead was missing was like a bucket of cold water poured over him, leaving Yang Kai chilled to the core.

Who knows when the Four Seasons Land will open again? Even if it does, by then his cultivation will surely be beyond the Dao Origin Realm, making it impossible for him to enter.

In other words, he probably has no hope of finding the Winter Bead in this lifetime, gathering the power of the Four Seasons, and recreating the Great Emperor of Time’s divine ability.

“Master, that guy isn’t dead yet!” Liu Yan’s startled cry suddenly rang in Yang Kai’s ear.

“Impossible!” Yang Kai was jolted awake.

In this battle, he had used the Extinction Thunder Bead and the Emperor Extinction Pill. With both trump cards unleashed, and his Incarnation wielding the Demonic Warhammer, even a true Third Stage Emperor Realm expert would have been reduced to dust. No matter how formidable a Corpse Puppet, it couldn’t possibly still be alive.

So when he heard Liu Yan’s words, he absolutely didn’t believe it.

But when he looked up, Yang Kai was stunned.

Not far ahead, the battered Corpse Puppet was now sitting cross-legged. Perhaps affected by the power of time, its already dried and lifeless body had turned ashen, like flour. As Yang Kai watched, chunks of flesh kept falling from its ruined body, turning to dust before hitting the ground. In no time, it had become half a skeleton, exposing its pale, bony frame.

The power of time was truly formidable. Previously he had exhausted all means and only managed to injure the Corpse Puppet with the Extinction Thunder Bead, but the Emperor Extinction Pill had destroyed its flesh to this extent. This was not just raw power but the influence of Law. The power of time silently flowed through the Corpse Puppet, making it experience millions of years in an instant. No matter how strong its body, without nourishment it would eventually be destroyed.

Yang Kai could clearly see that all the spirit arrays within the Corpse Puppet had dimmed and could no longer function.

But Liu Yan was right—the creature wasn’t dead yet. Its pair of green, ghostly eyes still flickered, as if struggling, and it occasionally let out low growls.

Yang Kai was instantly creeped out, growing wary, afraid the Corpse Puppet might lash out in its final moments.

He could tell that even if the Corpse Puppet wasn’t dead, it was at its last gasp. As long as he waited a bit longer, it would surely perish.

So Yang Kai didn’t rush to leave. Having just advanced to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, his Origin Qi had fully recovered and his injuries were healed. Even if the Corpse Puppet tried something, he was confident he could avoid it.

Yang Kai remained still, and Liu Yan silently stood by his side, her beautiful eyes shining with vigilance.

Suddenly, the Corpse Puppet’s eyes flickered violently, and a miserable howl came from its throat, as if it was resisting something. Soon, its green eyes stabilized, and its ferocious expression gradually softened.

In those ghostly eyes, a trace of intelligence appeared. It looked around in confusion, and when it saw Yang Kai, its gaze locked onto him.

“Master!” Liu Yan whispered, ready to fight at any moment.

Yang Kai frowned, meeting the Corpse Puppet’s gaze. Deep inside, a thought he could hardly believe arose. He cupped his fists and called out loudly, “Junior Yang Kai greets Senior!”

“Master, what are you doing?” Liu Yan looked at Yang Kai in surprise, not understanding his actions. The Corpse Puppet was clearly mindless, only fighting under the control of the arrays within its body, with no independent will. What was the point of Yang Kai’s gesture?

But to her astonishment, after Yang Kai finished speaking, the Corpse Puppet sitting cross-legged on the ground opened its mouth a few times, struggling to make several unintelligible sounds.

Because the Corpse Puppet’s body was so badly damaged, Liu Yan couldn’t understand what it was saying.

Even so, Liu Yan was completely stunned.

Because the Corpse Puppet actually responded to Yang Kai. Did this mean it had gained its own intelligence? If so, why hadn’t there been any sign before?

The Corpse Puppet kept trying to speak, and after a long effort, finally managed to utter a hoarse, metallic voice, unpleasant to the extreme.

“Are you a disciple of the Thousand Leaves Sect?”

With just this simple question, the Corpse Puppet seemed to use up all its strength, panting heavily afterward. Who knew what use breathing was in its current state?

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, increasingly convinced of his guess. He replied in a deep voice, “Junior is not!”

The Corpse Puppet said, “If not, why are you here?”

Perhaps because it had spoken once, its words became clearer and more fluent.

Yang Kai said, “Junior was entrusted by the current Sect Master of the Thousand Leaves Sect to come and repair the spatial teleportation array here.”

The Corpse Puppet listened, recalling for a long time before saying sadly, “Yes, that Formation Foundation platform was destroyed by this Lord…” He paused, then asked in surprise, “You can repair it? Are you proficient in Spatial Force?”

“I know a little,” Yang Kai replied modestly.

But the Corpse Puppet knew he was being humble. To enter this secret realm after the Formation Foundation platform was destroyed, it was not something that could be done with just a little knowledge. Clearly, Yang Kai had a high level of mastery over spatial power.

He did not pursue the matter further.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened. “Could Senior be the last Sect Master of the Thousand Leaves Sect to enter this place?”

When Yang Kai saw a trace of intelligence in the Corpse Puppet’s eyes, he had already guessed. Hearing the confirmation that the Formation Foundation platform was destroyed by this person, he was certain.

The Corpse Puppet before him was definitely the Sect Master of that generation of the Thousand Leaves Sect.

The Corpse Puppet nodded slightly, the bones in its neck creaking. Yang Kai watched nervously, afraid its head would fall off.

The Corpse Puppet said, “This Lord is Ye Chong!”

“Senior, you’re still alive!” Although he had guessed, Yang Kai was still shocked. Ye Chong was indeed the last Sect Master of the Thousand Leaves Sect to enter the secret realm, a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert.

Ye Chong said, “Only a remnant soul. When I tried to refine a puppet with my own body and failed to enter the Dao, I died long ago, leaving only a remnant soul on this body, waiting for the descendants of the Thousand Leaves Sect to come.”

Yang Kai nodded, about to ask more when Ye Chong said, “I don’t have much time. The only reason I could regain consciousness was because you destroyed this body. Although I don’t know how you managed it with your strength, I don’t have time to ask. I need you to do me a favor.”

“Senior, please speak!”

“Since the current descendant of the Ye Family asked you to repair the Space Array, you must be trustworthy. I ask you to take this Spatial Ring and deliver it to the current Sect Master of the Thousand Leaves Sect!” As Ye Chong spoke, he shakily removed the ring from his finger and flicked it toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it, immediately feeling an ancient, desolate aura envelop his hand.

This was a Spatial Ring from tens of thousands of years ago. Yang Kai could vaguely guess what treasures lay within. The various techniques and secret arts of the Thousand Leaves Sect mentioned by Ye Hen and his daughter were surely inside this ring.

Ye Chong said, “This ring bears my mark. Only a member of the Ye Family can open it with their bloodline power. Any attempt to force it open will destroy the ring.”
