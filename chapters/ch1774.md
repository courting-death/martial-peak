## Chapter 1774 — Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit

Facing Ni Guang's sudden strike, Xue Yue stood rooted to the spot; she believed Ni Guang would not harm her—Uncle Ni must have his reasons for acting as he did.

With a whoosh, a gust of wind brushed past Xue Yue's head, but before the attack arrived a wisp of black qi suddenly shot out from her hair, circled once in midair, and then streaked like an arrow toward the position where Ghost Ancestor stood.

That black qi fled with astonishing speed; even Ni Guang could not intercept it in time.

He could see clearly that the wisp of black qi resembled a human form, its face twisted like a tormented visage, like a yin-soul; it had been hiding among Xue Yue's hair tips, and because it was also black and its aura concealed, even he had not detected it at first.

By the time he realized, it was already too late.

The wisp of black qi soon arrived before Ghost Ancestor, and amid Ghost Ancestor's bizarre laughter he opened his mouth and swallowed that black qi into his abdomen.

"Isn't what you did just now a bit too shameless?" Ni Guang shouted coldly at Ghost Ancestor from a distance.

"Heh heh heh…" Ghost Ancestor still cackled strangely. "I act as I please; I do not need others to comment on me!"

Ni Guang's expression darkened as he watched Ghost Ancestor for a long moment, then he waved his hand and said, "I won't argue with you now—some other day I will ask you to show me your tricks!"

Although he was displeased that the Ghost Ancestor had tampered with Xue Yue, now was clearly not the time to quarrel with him. As tension stirred between them, Zi Long, not far away, was already watching with keen interest, looking as though he could hardly wait for him and the Ghost Ancestor to start fighting.

Ni Guang would not oblige him. Besides, from his sight it was obvious that Ghost Ancestor's tinkering with Xue Yue had not harmed her—it had merely been to pilfer information.

Saying that, he turned his face coldly toward Medicine Valley.

"Boy Yang, you heard what they just said, didn't you?" Ghost Ancestor asked Yang Kai quietly.

"I heard it." Yang Kai looked surprised. "When exactly did you plant that thing on Xue Yue?"

Xue Yue had been carried on his back the entire time. He had not noticed when Ghost Ancestor had meddled.

"Right when I handed you the Jingkong Beast's Inner Core," Ghost Ancestor said with a self-satisfied smile. "What, are you displeased with me for doing so?"

"Not at all…" Yang Kai chuckled softly. "It only proves that you are indeed far-sighted, Elder."

Ghost Ancestor laughed loudly. "Spare me the flattery; I travel alone and must always be cautious! Hmph. Since you also heard what they just said, then from now on… I will be counting on you."

"I'll do my best!" Yang Kai nodded, not promising more than he could deliver.

Outside Medicine Valley it fell silent for a time; the Void King Realm experts waited quietly, like Zi Long. Ni Guang knew what to do next, while Kong Fa, Xu Wei and Meng Tong perhaps understood only part of the situation, but as Void King Realm experts they possessed keen observation and analysis—if they couldn't immediately find a safe way into the valley, after Ni Guang and Zi Long made their moves they would be able to discern the pattern.

Xu Wei kept glancing at Yang Kai with curiosity, wondering how Yang Kai and Xue Yue had survived amid so many Illusory Void Butterflies; at the time he had used the two to stall the butterflies and fled, assuming the pair were surely dead.

Who would have thought that a few days later they would appear before him unscathed.

Xu Wei could only attribute the two's survival to Ghost Ancestor, assuming it was Ghost Ancestor's appearance that had saved them.

Time passed.

About an hour later, from somewhere deep within the vast valley ahead there suddenly came an odd sound, like the inhalation of something as it slept.

The sound rolled like thunder, like the pounding of a drum—dull and staggering to the spirit.

Almost all of the Void King Realm masters couldn’t help but tense up the moment they heard that voice.

Ni Guang, Luo Lan and Zi Long were shaken; their Saint Yuan surged quietly within them.

In the next moment, an abnormality erupted.

The previously calm valley suddenly whipped up a gale across the plain from the outside, blowing straight toward the valley's depths, and the inhaling sound grew ever clearer.

With that inhalation, the Seven Luminaries Divine Light that had been shrouding the valley appeared to be drawn inward, retreating like a tide toward the deep; in the blink of an eye the scenery around the valley's rim was revealed to everyone's view.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

At that moment Ni Guang, Luo Lan and Zi Long, three Void King Realm experts, moved like arrows loosed from bows, chasing the retreating Seven Luminaries Divine Light and instantly plunging into the valley!

Seeing them move, Kong Fa, Xu Wei and Meng Tong, who had been observing, could no longer contain themselves; they used their movement techniques, becoming streaks of light that shot off in different directions.

Ghost Ancestor likewise laughed and unfurled the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, wrapping Yang Kai as they rushed forward.

His cultivation was profound; among the Void King Realm experts only Ni Guang and Zi Long could match him, so his speed was tremendous—within the blink of an eye he had charged forward a full ten li.

Inside the valley, spatial rifts were countless—large and small—scattered everywhere; those rifts were like scars in the world, eternally adorning the place.

Many spatial rifts were hidden; some could be detected by Divine Sense, while others left no trace at all.

Ni Guang and Zi Long both carried secret treasures capable of probing spatial rifts; at this moment they were relying on those treasures to push forward, constantly changing direction to avoid the rifts.

The other Void King Realm experts who had not prepared in advance released their Divine Sense as much as possible to evade danger.

Within no more than ten breaths their speeds made the difference clear; though they had entered at nearly the same time, Ni Guang and Zi Long were undoubtedly far ahead.

Even more exaggerated was Ghost Ancestor.

With Yang Kai guiding him, he had no need to worry about spatial rifts—he merely followed Yang Kai's directions and barreled forward, so in a short time he overtook Ni Guang and Zi Long and left them out of sight.

"That bastard!" Zi Long shouted as he watched Ghost Ancestor's figure and could not help but curse.

The Lost Realm opened only after who knew how many years, and it contained spiritual herbs and wondrous medicines from ages past long extinct; whenever Medicine Valley produced a large yield of rare herbs, whoever held the speed advantage would reap the greater reward.

He had thought his greatest rival this time would be Ni Guang, but he had not expected Ghost Ancestor to burst onto the scene and catch him off guard.

"Is that fool courting death?" Zi Donglai, who followed Zi Long, stared ahead in disbelief. "Charging so fast—if he touches a hidden spatial rift, even as a Void King Realm he won't escape unscathed."

"Mind your own business!" Zi Long snorted coldly. "If he wants to die, let him."

"Yes!" Zi Donglai thought that made sense—rushing fast didn't guarantee good harvests in Medicine Valley; he might just die sooner.

With that his heart settled.

Nearby, Ni Guang, who was almost keeping pace with Zi Long, shook his head and sighed. "Xue Yue, that fellow is likely in grave danger; that Ghost Ancestor does not know how treacherous this place is—charging in like that will end badly."

"It shouldn't be so." Xue Yue shook her head; she knew what Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor were relying on, but she did not explain further.

Only Luo Lan let out a soft sigh.

If Yang Kai had been here the situation would have been far better, she thought, but unfortunately Yang Kai was not with her.

……

"That's about right." Once he released his Divine Sense and confirmed there was no one within dozens of li, Ghost Ancestor abruptly slowed, revealing himself and Yang Kai.

"Huh? I smell medicinal fragrance!" Yang Kai suddenly sniffed the air, his spirit jolting.

"Heh heh, looks like there are gains as soon as we entered." Ghost Ancestor chuckled low, then his expression turned solemn. "Boy Yang, I'll tell you now—anything we find in this Medicine Valley we'll split evenly; I won't take advantage of you. How about that?"

"As you say, Elder." Yang Kai nodded readily.

In a place like this, although Ghost Ancestor greatly relied on Yang Kai's prowess with spatial forces, it didn't mean Ghost Ancestor couldn't act without Yang Kai—alone he'd simply be slower.

So splitting the spoils evenly was somewhat to Ghost Ancestor's loss; Yang Kai naturally would not object.

"Over there!" Yang Kai confirmed the source of the medicinal scent and suddenly pointed in a direction.

Saying that, he dashed straight toward it, Ghost Ancestor close behind.

After a dozen breaths they arrived before a fruit tree about half a man's height; its branches and leaves were sparse, with only a few scattered conical leaves, the twigs looking frail.

On those branches hung four tidy, dark purple fruits the size of a baby's fist; they shimmered with radiance, their skins crystalline and translucent, seemingly revealing the sweet flesh within and making one salivate at the sight.

A peculiar aura lingered around the four fruits as if they emitted it themselves.

The Ghost Ancestor was shrouded entirely in black mist, yet from within it, his gaze shot out as if it held tangible substance, bright and piercing with spirit.

At a glance he recognized the extraordinary nature of these four fruits—these were spiritual fruits that could greatly aid his power!

"Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit!" Yang Kai had been observing and matching the object's features against his knowledge of various spiritual herbs and medicines in his mind; after a while he finally confirmed what the fruit was and could not help but exclaim.

"This is the Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit?" Ghost Ancestor raised his brow in surprise and asked joyfully, "The kind that can be used to refine the Great Brahma Heaven Pill?"

He had evidently heard of the Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit and knew what kind of elixir it could produce.
