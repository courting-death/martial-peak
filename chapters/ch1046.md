## Chapter 1046 — Taking Full Advantage

In the hollow, Yang Kai and Xue Yue sat face to face, pressed tightly together; they could clearly feel each other’s body heat and smell one another’s breath.

Yang Kai had her locked in a deadly embrace, his arms so forceful they threatened to crush her delicate frame.

Xue Yue’s face drained of color; the burning, iron-like hardness pressing between her legs sent her heart into chaos. She immediately understood what was happening; her body trembled, and terror and horror filled her beautiful eyes as she instinctively clamped her legs shut, trapping that monstrous, feral head to keep it from invading her sacred place.

Yang Kai gave a crafty smirk, his expression growing even more delightfully rapturous.

Xue Yue’s pair of lovely legs, skin fair and soft, tightened around him, bringing him unimaginable pleasure and comfort, causing his murderous intent to falter.

“I… I’ll fight you to the death!” Xue Yue, never before humiliated like this, screamed hysterically. The composed, unflappable Young Master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild was gone; she raged like a madwoman, veins bulging at her temples. Gathering strength from nowhere, she slammed both palms into Yang Kai, and a flicker of seven-colored radiance flashed from her hands.

Bam, bam…

Yang Kai felt as if struck by lightning; his body shuddered and he spat a plume of golden blood that sprayed across Xue Yue’s face and hair.

He was in no good shape either—he had deliberately taken a blow earlier to get close to her—and after being hit twice more his strength was nearly exhausted; his face suddenly went slack.

Under those two palms, the wounds inside him that had just begun to recover worsened again.

Xue Yue seemed berserk; her fingertips dug into Yang Kai’s flesh with all their force, clawing and tearing strips of blood and meat. She opened her mouth and bit at his shoulder and chest, resisting with savage force as if to die together with him.

She possessed at least the cultivation of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. Though that earlier calamity had left her unable to exert even thirty percent of her usual strength, the fierce struggle still left Yang Kai somewhat overwhelmed. In an instant, he was drenched in blood, his body covered with strange bite marks…

“You're courting death!” Yang Kai roared, and with no thought of mercy he slammed a brutal fist into Xue Yue’s pretty face.

The blow sent Xue Yue’s head snapping to the side; her cheek swelled as if bruised, and the force drove both of them rolling to the ground.

Before they hit, Yang Kai violently twisted her body so her back faced him, his hands still holding her tight, pinning her arms so she could no longer scratch or bite him.

Xue Yue struggled and fought without yielding; every usable part of her body turned into a weapon, constantly inflicting damage on Yang Kai as she tried to free herself from his grasp.

Boom, boom, boom…

The two of them rolled and tumbled in the hollow of the dead star, fists and feet flying, pressed in the tightest positions yet fighting like mortal enemies.

Dust rose around them, and from time to time a flash of light bloomed.

But no matter who it was, their bodies grew steadily weaker until movement became impossible.

Heavy panting filled the air as they lay with chest to back in a tucked spot of the hollow, motionless, both staring up at the cold, dark starry sky.

At some point Yang Kai’s hands had slipped across and covered Xue Yue’s two firm mounds; the astonishing sensation under his palms jolted his spirit, and he felt as if he could instantly be revitalized.

When Xue Yue had appeared in male form, Yang Kai had never imagined she possessed such a figure. But now, with those twin peaks firmly grasped in his hands, he couldn’t help but marvel at just how well-endowed this woman truly was.

Yang Kai’s hands were large, yet a single palm could not cover an entire jade mound.

The dainty protrusions rubbed against his palm—hot and soft, yet astonishingly springy.

Yang Kai pressed harder, clenching them tightly.

Enchanting sounds escaped from Xue Yue’s throat; her head tilted up slightly in discomfort from the squeeze, but mostly from shame and indignation.

Yang Kai ignored her and instead relished the stimulation from her smooth back and perky buttocks.

Despite the wounds and blood, Xue Yue’s skin was pale and tender, glowing like a newborn, and during their earlier rolling Yang Kai had fully appreciated the allure of her plump, rounded buttocks; the two cheeks pressed against his most vulnerable place, sending him into rapturous torment and leaving his mind in a whirl.

The fierce, throbbing hardness was pressed tightly between her buttocks, and it seemed that with just the slightest movement of Yang Kai’s body, he could break through that final barrier and completely claim the woman beneath him.

In that ambiguous posture their intimacies were pressed tightly together.

A warm droplet suddenly slid down onto Yang Kai’s arm, and Xue Yue let out a soft whimper.

“You’re kidding me…” Yang Kai was speechless; in the middle of a life-or-death struggle this woman began to cry—he couldn’t tell if it was genuine or an act.

“No one’s treated me like this since I was young… hardly anyone even knows my true sex. You dare violate me like this—I’ll remember you, and I’ll make you pay!” Xue Yue ground her teeth and hissed.

“Let’s see if you can survive first!” Yang Kai let out a dark, menacing laugh. “Once I recover a bit, I’ll ravage you before I kill you!”

“Try it!” Xue Yue was unmoved and traded insults with Yang Kai. “You’re not in good condition either. Before you came, I already swallowed an Upper-Level Saint-Grade pill; soon I’ll have the strength to break free of you—I wonder then who’ll die!”

She stopped crying and actually sneered. “Don’t worry, I won’t let you die easily. I’ll make you taste every torment of mankind and slowly torture you to death!”

Yang Kai blew a warm breath against her delicate earlobe; Xue Yue’s expression shifted again, her body trembling as she held her breath, afraid he might bring her further humiliation.

“Then let’s see who recovers first!” Yang Kai said, looking certain of victory.

He feared no one in terms of recovery speed. Although Xue Yue had taken an Upper-Level Saint-Grade pill, he possessed Demon God Golden Blood—within moments the flesh pried and bitten away by Xue Yue began to writhe and seal, and the condition of his internal organs improved.

The two fell silent, wrapped in each other with skin touching like lovers basking in a fleeting warmth, but beneath that veneer of tenderness murderous intent simmered.

All of a sudden, a ray of seven-colored light burst forth. Yang Kai let out a cry of pain, his expression twisting as he grit his teeth and shouted, “You wretch! How vicious can you be?!”

“Hah…” Xue Yue laughed smugly. “Against someone like you, what’s wrong with being a little underhanded? Let go of me right now, or I’ll shatter your Dantian and cripple your cultivation—make sure you can never cultivate again for the rest of your life!”

One of her slender jade-like hands had slipped around her own waist and was now buried in Yang Kai’s abdomen, caught tightly between his tense muscles. Energy flickered at her fingertips—one surge, and she could pierce into Yang Kai’s Dantian to destroy the very source of his strength.

Yang Kai had no idea when she had prepared that reserve of energy—perhaps it had been concealed from the start.

He finally realized this woman was different from other women: even when subdued she would use every means to resist and seize the initiative.

“Will you let go? I’ll give you three breaths to decide—after that you will… you, what are you doing?” Xue Yue’s calm tone suddenly collapsed into chaos as she cried out in alarm, face pale. “Stop, don’t move!”

While she threatened him, Yang Kai did not retreat but instead moved forward, letting her small hand sink deeper into his abdomen; yet by doing so his feral hardness gradually pressed against the narrow passage between Xue Yue’s legs.

It was almost touching the entrance of that passage.

Xue Yue instantly panicked, uncertain what to do.

Yang Kai gathered his breath into his Dantian, maintaining his strength in his waist. Cruelly, he stuck out his tongue and licked Xue Yue’s delicate earlobe.

“You bastard!” Xue Yue cursed, her body trembling.

“Curse away. There’s a saying: better to die under the peony than live as a prudish ghost. I don’t care if you wreck my Dantian; if you dare touch me I’ll ruin your chastity!” Yang Kai chuckled. “I’m alone with no ties, unlike Young Master Xue Yue who holds status and power—ha, when you marry in the future and your husband finds out you’re not intact, that will be entertaining. For someone like me, to possess someone like you is worth my life!”

“Madman! Madman! You’re insane!” Terror filled Xue Yue’s beautiful eyes; Yang Kai’s desperate, demonic behavior had truly frightened her. The rigid foreign object pressing between her legs left her helpless, and her constant calculation and scheming crumbled in that moment.

This man was more vicious than the robbers of the Spine of the Star River and crueler than the villains of the Abandoned Nest.

“I am mad—what else? Since things have come to this, either you die or I do; there’s no other way. Before death I’ll savor your intoxicating taste, so I can remember it in the Yellow Springs.”

Saying this, Yang Kai thrust his powerful waist forward in gradual, forceful motions.

He seemed truly resolved to die under the peony—he no longer cared for his life.

“Wait!” Xue Yue tensed her slender body and pushed forward, striving to steady her voice. “I think maybe we can talk?”

“Talk?” Yang Kai paused his assault and asked with interest, “About what? How would we talk?”

“We never had any great hatred; there’s no need to make this a big deal, right?” Xue Yue parted her lips; hate swam in her eyes, but for the sake of preserving her chastity she swallowed her pride.

“You mean… we can still turn hostility into peace?”

“Why not?” Xue Yue tilted her head and her snowy face pressed against Yang Kai’s lips. She felt bitter, immediately pulling away and cursing the bastard in her heart for attempting to take advantage of her—wishing she could crush him to dust.
