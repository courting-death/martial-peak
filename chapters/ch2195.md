## Chapter 2195 — Shameless!

The man surnamed Chang, upon hearing this, said, "That's right, everything is here!"

"Alright, you can pack up and leave now!" Yang Kai waved his hand at him.

"Ah..." The man surnamed Chang's expression changed, and he cried out, "Brother Yang, shouldn't you take another look..."

"Get out!" Yang Kai waved his hand again without giving him a chance to argue. Surging spatial power directly teleported the man outside, and he shouted loudly, "Next!"

After coming to his senses, the man found himself standing far from Yang Kai. He couldn't help but feel a wave of regret, pounding his chest and stomping his feet, secretly hating himself for not seizing the opportunity, and hating Yang Kai even more for being so mercenary and heartless...

The others looked at him with gloating expressions.

Leaving aside the reactions of those bystanders, the expressions of Wuchang, Xiao Chen, and the others grew incomparably grave.

Because from the move Yang Kai had just displayed, they could see one thing: Yang Kai's mastery over spatial power had already reached an inconceivable level!

Not only could he teleport himself, but he could even teleport others away!

Of course, the prerequisite was that the other person had to be within the special world he created. Even so, it was still shocking enough.

How could a mere First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator possibly comprehend the mysteries of space to such a profound degree?

With such an ability, in the Dao Origin Realm, who could possibly kill him?

While everyone’s expressions were shifting, another person passed through the rift and walked up to Yang Kai.

This person was a woman. No one knew which sect she came from. She was alluring and charming, dressed boldly, with large swathes of snow-white skin exposed, her chest heaving magnificently, making people dizzy just looking at her...

She walked up to Yang Kai and gave a seductive smile. Instead of immediately taking out something to exchange, she coquettishly said, "Young Brother, I didn’t gain much here. What should I do?"

Yang Kai looked up at her, his eyes lecherously fixed on her chest, and chuckled, "So what do you want to do?"

"I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking you..." she replied in a sweet, flirtatious voice, slowly squatting down to reveal even more of her ample chest.

"Miss, are you trying to seduce me..." Yang Kai sniffed, then reached out and grabbed her soft little hand.

"You’re terrible!" The woman glared at Yang Kai coquettishly, but didn’t hurry to pull her hand back. Instead, she showed a shy, half-willing, half-refusing look, making people’s hearts race and fingers itch.

At the same time, a faint fragrance wafted from the woman’s delicate body. The scent was subtle, but seemed to have a magical effect, making men’s blood boil and stirring ripples and endless fantasies deep within their hearts.

"Shameless!" Lan Xun spat from far away.

"Utterly brazen!" Murong Xiaoxiao also snapped.

"What a disgrace!" Xia Sheng gnashed his teeth, his eyes glowing red as he glared at Yang Kai, grumbling, "Honestly... it’s just too enviable!"

"Young Brother..." The woman seemed to want to show off more of her unique charms, but as soon as she spoke, her expression changed dramatically. She shot to her feet, staring at Yang Kai with vigilance and anger.

Yang Kai was holding a Spatial Ring in his hand, releasing his Divine Sense to check its contents.

The woman looked down, her pretty face turning even uglier, because she realized the Spatial Ring she’d been wearing had somehow disappeared without her noticing. She had no idea how Yang Kai had managed to take it off her without her realizing it.

"As expected, there’s nothing good in here!" Yang Kai muttered, then tossed the Spatial Ring back to the woman.

She caught it, her ample chest heaving in anger, and she gritted her teeth, "You..."

"But that set of underwear is quite unique. It seems to have some mysteries to it. We should find the time to sit down and study it together..." Yang Kai looked at the woman with a smile.

"Who wants to study with you, you scoundrel, degenerate, scum!" The woman’s face turned red with anger. She stomped her foot, spun around, and dashed out. Under the teasing gazes of the crowd, she didn’t want to stay here a moment longer and flew straight for the exit.

Yang Kai rubbed his nose and muttered, "If you don’t want to study, then forget it. Why curse me?"

He put on an innocent face, but quickly straightened up and shouted, "Next!"

Immediately, another person rushed in.

Half an hour passed in a flash...

More than thirty people had already come up to Yang Kai, hoping to exchange for the Supreme Mystic Pill, but so far, none had succeeded.

At first, everyone was worried they’d be too late and miss out, but now it seemed there was no need to worry at all. What Yang Kai wanted must be extremely rare, otherwise, out of more than thirty people, at least one would have met his requirements.

Realizing this, the remaining martial artists were no longer anxious.

Instead, they were secretly calculating what they should take out to satisfy Yang Kai’s appetite and exchange for the Supreme Mystic Pill.

Although Yang Kai had said everyone should use their harvests from the Four Seasons Land to exchange, all those present were Dao Origin Realm cultivators—who didn’t already have some good things in their Spatial Rings? Where those things came from, Yang Kai couldn’t tell.

So, the later martial artists not only took out everything they’d gained in the Four Seasons Land, but also selectively brought out precious items from their Spatial Rings, hoping to catch Yang Kai’s eye.

The value of these items was not low. Some even made Yang Kai’s eyes light up, but he still resisted the urge to trade.

Because there weren’t many Supreme Mystic Pills, he had to exchange them only for what he needed most!

Calamity Fruit! That was what he needed most!

Ever since he’d decided to keep the Supreme Mystic Pills for himself, Yang Kai had planned to use them to exchange for the Calamity Fruit. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have made such a strange request, demanding that everyone use their harvests from the Four Seasons Land to trade with him!

Previously, in the Winter Domain, he had found a Calamity Fruit tree, but someone else had gotten there first and picked the spirit fruit.

Now, with almost all the martial artists who entered the Four Seasons Land gathered here, unless something unexpected happened, the Calamity Fruit must be in someone’s hands here!

To exchange for the Supreme Mystic Pill in Yang Kai’s hand, that person would never keep it hidden...

In other words, sooner or later, the Calamity Fruit would appear before Yang Kai. He just needed to wait patiently!

"Eldest Brother, take a look at these things. Is there anything you want?"

While Yang Kai was lost in thought, a woman walked up to him, then took out some items from her Spatial Ring and placed them before him.

Yang Kai responded and began to examine the items.

He’d done this many times before, and it almost always ended in disappointment. But this time...

"Hm?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, staring intently at one of the items, his heart skipping a beat.

It wasn’t the Calamity Fruit, but something else that caught his attention.

After seeing the item, one of his earlier suspicions was faintly confirmed.

Yang Kai was surprised inside, but kept a calm face, quickly shifting his gaze to examine the other items the woman had taken out.

Over a dozen stalks of Spiritual Medicine—rare, but not extremely precious. Seven or eight Demonic Beast Inner Cores, of decent quality, but not very high grade. A piece of bright red stone, which looked ordinary on the surface, but if one probed it with Divine Sense, one could feel the heat contained within.

Yang Kai immediately had an idea. Staring at the red stone, he exclaimed, "Crystal Stone!"

The woman was startled and involuntarily took several steps back before steadying herself. Her eyes sparkled as she looked at Yang Kai, "Do you need this?"

She had only come to try her luck with Yang Kai, not expecting much. After all, more than thirty people before her had come in high spirits and left disappointed.

Since no one knew what Yang Kai actually wanted, the initiative in these trades was entirely in his hands. Whether others could get the Supreme Mystic Pill depended on luck.

But what she hadn’t expected was that Yang Kai would show such great interest in a stone she’d taken out. This gave her hope for the exchange!

If that was the case, she might really have a chance to get a Supreme Mystic Pill!

On the other side, the watching martial artists were also shocked.

After all, this was the first time Yang Kai had shown any real reaction. The people who’d gone in before had only seen disappointment and impatience on his face.

For a moment, everyone was extremely curious, wanting to see what the woman had taken out to interest Yang Kai so much.

But they couldn’t see...

Under the influence of the spatial laws, that shattered world was filled with countless spatial rifts. Any strand of Divine Sense sent in would be swallowed up and disappear...

Yang Kai glanced at the woman and found her to be sweet and cute, with a round, rosy face and a petite, curvy figure. However, her cultivation wasn’t high—only Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. No one knew which Sect she came from.

Perhaps because of what Yang Kai had done and said to the previous woman, this round-faced girl was now a bit nervous and wary as he looked at her.

She hurriedly said, "I picked it up by accident in the Summer Domain..."

"This is a good thing!" Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. "I am indeed interested."

"Really?" The round-faced girl’s face lit up with joy. "Then can we..."

"No, we can’t!" Yang Kai shook his head.

"Ah..." The round-faced girl immediately looked disappointed.

"Yang Kai, you’d better know your limits!" For some reason, Luo Yuan suddenly shouted from outside, clearly very dissatisfied with Yang Kai.

"What are you yelling about!" Yang Kai shot him a glare. "What’s it got to do with you? Mind your own business!"
