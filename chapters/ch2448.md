## Chapter 2448 — True Phoenix Fire

In the blink of an eye, everyone had scattered, not a single person remained. These experts seemed afraid of falling behind, so they spared no effort in chasing after the Mountain and River Bell.

Yet Yang Kai turned around and flew back toward that dark red star.

Soon, he returned to the spot where the Mountain and River Bell had previously been, his gaze grave as he surveyed the surroundings.

The place was now empty, but the unsettling feeling in Yang Kai’s heart was coming from right here.

That was precisely why, instead of chasing after the Mountain and River Bell like the others, he had come back here to figure things out.

After a moment, as if he had discovered something, his eyes suddenly brightened, and he arrived at the original location of the Mountain and River Bell.

This had originally been a small mountain peak, but due to the Mountain and River Bell’s tremors, the mountain had collapsed. Now that the bell had flown off on its own, the area was a complete mess.

However, at the spot where the Mountain and River Bell had once rested, a unique, scorching power was slowly dispersing.

Earlier, everyone’s attention had been drawn to the Mountain and River Bell, so no one noticed anything unusual here.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel suspicious, unsure what kind of trickery might be hidden here. After a moment’s thought, he soared into the air and, with a powerful swing of his fist, struck down toward the ground below.

Several fist shadows rained down, shattering the earth and splitting it open. In the blink of an eye, a small pit appeared within Yang Kai’s field of vision.

In an instant, violent heat erupted, surging outward with such force that Yang Kai’s expression changed. At the same time, a dense wave of Origin Power rippled through the air from below.

Looking down, he saw that the pit was filled with boiling magma. The scorching temperature even made Yang Kai’s expression change; he dared not approach carelessly.

“A Fire Elemental Origin?” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed as he muttered, a bold guess rising in his heart.

It was highly likely that the Fire Elemental Origin was hidden right here!

The reason he had come to this star was because Zhong Zhenyong had said someone had discovered traces of a Fire Elemental Origin here. But after arriving, the appearance of the Mountain and River Bell had excited everyone so much that no one thought about the Fire Elemental Origin anymore.

But who could have known—the Fire Elemental Origin was actually hidden beneath the Mountain and River Bell, as if it had been suppressed by it!

No wonder dozens of Dao Origin Realm cultivators holding Star Seals couldn’t sense the exact location of the Fire Elemental Origin. So this was the reason.

When Yang Kai had come here earlier, he had also tried to use his Star Seal to search for the Fire Elemental Origin, but it always felt elusive, impossible to pinpoint. Thinking back now, it was definitely because of the Mountain and River Bell’s presence.

Now that it had flown off, the Fire Elemental Origin was immediately exposed.

That Origin Power was hidden beneath the magma, and it was precisely because of this Fire Elemental Origin that this star had produced so many fire-type Spiritual Herbs, and why there was such scorching magma here!

At this thought, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel secretly excited.

He felt that returning here was truly a wise decision. With so many people fighting over the Mountain and River Bell, its ownership wouldn’t be decided anytime soon, but he alone had discovered the Fire Elemental Origin and could collect it at his leisure.

However, Yang Kai was only guessing that the Fire Elemental Origin was hidden beneath the magma. Whether it was true or not, he couldn’t be sure, and even if it was, he hadn’t considered how to collect it.

The Fire Elemental Origin was not so easily obtained. One careless move, and he could easily bring disaster upon himself.

Just as Yang Kai was at a loss, the magma before him suddenly began to boil, huge bubbles rolling up and bursting, and the unbearable heat grew even stronger.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but circulate his Origin Qi to protect himself. Only then did he feel a bit better.

But this sudden change made him extremely wary, and he retreated a few steps.

Moments later, the magma in the pit seemed to be boiling, and then—a clear, melodious bird cry suddenly echoed through the world, ringing in Yang Kai’s ears…

Yang Kai was stunned!

Because he was all too familiar with that sound.

Back when he dual cultivated with Su Yan and the dragon and phoenix phenomenon appeared, the cry of the Ice Phoenix was exactly like this—shocking the soul and making all living things submit!

Crash!

A beautiful, fiery red figure suddenly shot out from the pit. With its appearance, all the heat in the area shifted, and the magma in the pit instantly turned to stone.

The sky was suddenly overshadowed by a massive figure, its piercing cry soaring to the heavens.

Yang Kai stared up in a daze, fixated on that breathtakingly beautiful form. He swallowed hard and said with difficulty, “Fire Phoenix!”

In this world, there are Divine Spirits, with the dragon and phoenix reigning supreme.

The Dragon Clan and Phoenix Clan are the strongest among the Divine Spirits—this is almost undisputed. The Dragon Clan aside, the Phoenix Clan itself has two great branches.

Fire Phoenix and Ice Phoenix!

These two branches command the ultimate mysteries of fire and ice, bringing the extremes of heat and cold to the world.

The Divine Spirit Luan Feng that Yang Kai once saw outside Fenglin City at Yuqing Mountain was a type of Fire Phoenix. The Luan Feng’s World-Ending Black Flame was the very embodiment of destruction and calamity. Just a single breath of that black flame kept Yuqing Mountain burning year-round, never extinguished, attracting countless fire-attribute cultivators to go into seclusion there to comprehend its mysteries.

And the magnificent, massive figure before him was undoubtedly the most authentic Fire Phoenix! Its bloodline was even purer than the Luan Feng’s.

Yang Kai never imagined that in the Shattered Star Sea, he would actually see a Fire Phoenix! And it had even been suppressed beneath the Mountain and River Bell.

If the cultivators who came here hadn’t accidentally discovered the Mountain and River Bell and startled it away, this Fire Phoenix might have remained in slumber, never seeing the light of day.

“No, that’s not right!” Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly narrowed as he stared intently at the Fire Phoenix soaring in the sky, sensing something amiss.

He realized the Fire Phoenix bore no trace of life, not even a physical body. It was entirely composed of pure energy, and as it appeared, Yang Kai could clearly feel the power of the Fire Elemental Origin.

In an instant, Yang Kai suddenly understood and blurted out, “True Phoenix Fire!”

This wasn’t a Divine Spirit Fire Phoenix at all—it was the True Phoenix Fire. Coupled with Qi Hai’s earlier words, Yang Kai realized it was the True Phoenix Fire left here after the Martial Flame Great Emperor’s death!

In terms of value, it was in no way inferior to the Mountain and River Bell. In fact, for some people, it was a supreme treasure, unmatched by anything else.

But… why would Origin Cauldron Great Emperor’s Mountain and River Bell be suppressing Martial Flame Great Emperor’s True Phoenix Fire? Weren’t these two Great Emperors allies who once fought Heaven Devouring Great Emperor together?

Yang Kai was completely confused. He had no idea what had happened during the Great Emperors’ battle all those years ago for such a thing to occur.

But there was no use dwelling on events from tens of thousands of years ago.

Now, with the True Phoenix Fire right before his eyes, the mystery of this place was solved. The Fire Elemental Origin on this star was actually the True Phoenix Fire, far more precious than any ordinary Fire Elemental Origin.

The True Phoenix Fire was the very inheritance of the Fire Phoenix. The Fire Phoenix may die, but the True Phoenix Fire will never be extinguished. Within this true fire lies the experience and knowledge of the Fire Phoenix Clan accumulated over countless ages. Whoever obtains this True Phoenix Fire can soar to the heavens in a single bound.

For Liu Yan, this was nothing short of a complete rebirth. If Liu Yan could absorb and refine it, given time, she might very well become another Fire Phoenix!

“Screech!” The piercing cry rang out again, snapping Yang Kai out of his excitement. Looking up, he was startled to see the True Phoenix Fire in the sky suddenly spin, transforming into a fist-sized fireball that shot straight toward him.

In that instant, Yang Kai’s soul nearly left his body.

He prided himself on his strength—he could even fight ordinary Emperor Realm cultivators—but faced with the legendary True Phoenix Fire, which could incinerate all things, he didn’t want to touch it at all.

If it hit him, he’d probably be reduced to ashes in an instant.

Just as he was about to dodge, a force within his body suddenly surged out of his control.

Immediately after, a high, resounding dragon roar erupted, deafening to the ears. Bathed in golden light, the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power that had always been hidden within Yang Kai’s body was suddenly revealed behind him, as if provoked by the True Phoenix Fire.

A massive dragon head, its eyes as large as houses, glared fiercely under the golden radiance, exuding an unrivaled majesty.

The dragon’s roar and the phoenix’s cry intertwined, echoing endlessly.

The two great Origin Powers actually clashed across the void, causing space itself to collapse and the universe to shatter.

Suddenly, a muffled groan came from not far away, as if someone had been caught in the aftermath of the collision. Yang Kai’s eyes turned cold as he glanced over, but he saw nothing at all.

He had no time to worry about anything else. He was right at the center of the clash between the two Divine Spirit Origins, barely holding on. If not for the protection of the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power, he would have been pulverized already. Even so, his bones were cracking, his skin splitting open, and golden blood flowed continuously—he looked utterly miserable.

The flames grew fiercer, and the golden light was just as unyielding.

Between heaven and earth, it seemed only these two colors of radiance remained.

This was a battle without physical forms—a contest between the supreme overlords of the Divine Spirits. As the Origin Powers clashed, Yang Kai, despite the pain, gained many insights and reaped great benefits.

As time passed, the collision of the two Origin Powers grew even more intense. Yang Kai had to activate the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, covering his body in dragon scales. Even so, his qi and blood churned, and he kept coughing up blood, as if he might die at any moment.

He looked utterly wretched, but his eyes shone with wild joy.

Because he realized that, in the very center of this clash, his understanding of Origin and Law Power had soared to new heights. Things that had once been obscure suddenly became clear.

He even found himself wishing this collision would last forever.
