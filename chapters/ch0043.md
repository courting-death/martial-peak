## Chapter 43 — The Sect Leader’s Secret

Within the Black Wind Forest, a group of more than a dozen from Lingxiao Pavilion was making their way through the dense woods.

Yang Kai had never expected that the “good place” Su Mu promised to take him to yesterday would turn out to be the Black Wind Forest. As they walked, Yang Kai noticed a clearly defined path cutting through the thicket. Such a dense forest would never have a beaten trail unless it was frequently traveled.

Could it be that many people came and went through the Black Wind Forest? Yang Kai scanned his surroundings and indeed saw several figures not far ahead, moving in the same direction as their group.

“Senior Brother, do you know why we happened to meet Cheng Shaofeng and his group at the edge of the Black Wind Forest that day?” Su Mu asked suddenly, walking beside Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly, a faint suspicion forming in his mind. “Could it be that Cheng Shaofeng and the others are also headed into the Black Wind Forest?”

“That’s right. Our Lingxiao Pavilion isn’t far from Fengyu Tower or the Blood Battle Gang, and the Black Wind Forest is in roughly the same distance from all three. Essentially, if disciples from any of the three sects want to enter here, they must pass through that four-way intersection.”

“What is so attractive about this place? Why do all of you come here?”

Su Mu grinned proudly. “Senior Brother, you don’t know. There’s a trade market here in the Black Wind Forest. It’s the place where disciples from our three sects—and indeed all martial artists in Wumei Town—conduct their trades. Disciples can exchange unused cultivation materials for useful items or sell them for silver and gold. The Black Wind Trade Market is quite lively. Senior Brother must come see it for yourself.”

Li Yuntian nodded in agreement. “Yes, Senior Brother, you can often find good things there. Last time, Su Shao bought a Tianyuan Fruit for just ten taels of silver.”

“Tianyuan Fruit?” Yang Kai’s expression flickered with interest.

“Indeed, a lower-level Earth-Grade spirit fruit. The seller didn’t know its value, so I took advantage of the situation,” Su Mu said with a hint of pride.

A lower-level Earth-Grade spirit fruit would normally fetch at least a thousand taels of silver, yet Su Mu had bought it for only ten—quite the bargain.

Yang Kai had never heard of the Black Wind Trade Market before. Having been with Lingxiao Pavilion for over three years without making friends, no one had told him about such matters.

Su Mu’s group seemed to frequent the place often, each familiar with it. From their conversation, Yang Kai caught many interesting stories and began to look forward to visiting the market himself.

Having cultivated the True Yang Technique, he hoped to find some Yang-attributed pills or elixirs there, though his funds were tight. Remembering the small Recovery Pill Su Mu gave him yesterday, Yang Kai felt a bit more confident.

The Black Wind Trade Market was some distance away, so the group chatted as they walked.

Suddenly, Yang Kai asked, “Junior Brother Su, does Lingxiao Pavilion have an Elder Eleven?”

He recalled the mysterious old man he had met near Dragon Confinement Ravine, who had introduced himself as Elder Eleven. The man’s aura was enigmatic and unforgettable.

“Elder Eleven?” Su Mu was taken aback. “Where would Lingxiao Pavilion have an Elder Eleven?”

“Oh, I was just asking casually,” Yang Kai said, understanding dawning. The old man’s claim to be Elder Eleven was likely false. Since the man was kind and bore no ill will, Yang Kai didn’t want to pry and cause trouble.

Li Yuntian chuckled. “Senior Brother Yang, you’ve been training all day and might not know much about Lingxiao Pavilion. There are only five elders in the pavilion—no Elder Eleven.”

Knowing Yang Kai’s past hardships and mistreatment, the group kindly explained more about Lingxiao Pavilion to prevent any future awkward questions.

Su Mu, backed by an elder, knew more about Lingxiao Pavilion than anyone else. Somehow, the conversation turned to the sect leader.

Lowering his voice, Su Mu said, “I heard from the old ghost that our sect leader is an extraordinary figure. His current strength has reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, just one step away from breakthrough. He is the strongest martial artist within thousands of miles.”

The peak of the Divine Roaming Realm! Yang Kai’s heart jolted.

The cultivation ranks for martial artists start from Body Tempering, then Open Origin, Qi Movement, Separation and Union, True Essence, and Divine Roaming. Each realm has nine stages, and the higher the stage, the harder the breakthrough. The Divine Roaming Realm was extremely rare. To think the Lingxiao Pavilion’s sect leader had already reached its peak—one step beyond would make him a true pinnacle master.

“That Blood Battle Gang leader Hu Man and Fengyu Tower’s master Xiao Ruohan are only at the sixth or seventh stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. They can’t compare to our sect leader,” Su Mu said proudly. A sect leader’s strength brought honor to all disciples.

“How long until the sect leader breaks through?” Li Yuntian asked eagerly. If the sect leader suddenly advanced, Lingxiao Pavilion would dominate the region, and who would dare provoke them?

Su Mu’s expression darkened, and he shook his head with a sigh.

“What’s wrong?” Li Yuntian grew anxious.

“The old ghost said the sect leader reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm over ten years ago.”

“Then why hasn’t he broken through yet?” Everyone was puzzled.

Even if cultivation was difficult, ten years was long enough to advance.

Su Mu just shook his head. “I dare not say.”

“Su Shao, how can you do this—tease us with curiosity and then leave us hanging? It’s like undressing a beauty without going further—so cruel!” Zhao Hu shouted, and the group eagerly urged Su Mu to continue.

“Alright, but remember, this must never be spread outside, or there will be great trouble,” Su Mu said seriously, glancing around before lowering his voice. “Over ten years ago, something major happened in Lingxiao Pavilion. Because of that event, the sect leader’s cultivation has been stuck.”

“What happened?” Everyone swallowed nervously.

“Our sect leader never married nor had children. He only took two disciples. The root of the problem lies with these two. The elder brother was diligent, the second brother clever—both prodigies. The sect leader taught them wholeheartedly, sparing nothing. They were evenly matched in strength, neither inferior to the other. But because of their differing temperaments, the sect leader’s teaching methods varied. The elder brother received much praise, while the second brother faced harsh criticism. This caused the second brother to misunderstand the sect leader’s intentions, believing he was biased toward the elder brother. Out of jealousy and resentment, the two grew apart, and the second brother’s heart darkened. Eventually, he found a sinister cultivation technique somewhere and began practicing it.”

“Ah…” The crowd gasped in shock.

Su Mu continued, and everyone listened intently.

Unexpectedly, Su Mu was quite eloquent—a master storyteller whose sharp words vividly painted the rivalry between the two brothers in just a few sentences.

Yang Kai listened silently, not interrupting. He believed the story was true but suspected Su Mu might have embellished some details.
