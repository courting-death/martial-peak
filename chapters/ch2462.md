## Chapter 2462 — Emperor Yuan Transformation

At this final moment, Yang Kai forced himself to stay alert, not moving a muscle.

Boom…

The eighty-first chime rang out right on schedule. The violent impact nearly tore his entire body apart, and the pain that pierced deep into his soul made him let out a beast-like growl. Blood streamed from all seven orifices, making his face look terrifying.

The fierce, savage power rampaged and boiled within him, and the sound of bones dislocating crackled on and on.

Yang Kai felt as if he was about to die. That aura of death made his whole body go cold, his hands and feet icy.

He let out a great shout, surging his Origin Qi, pushing his cultivation to its absolute limit.

In just an instant, Yang Kai felt as if a million years had passed. When the aftershocks faded, his eyes suddenly shone with dazzling light.

He had succeeded! After a year and a half of effort, he had finally withstood the eighty-one chimes of the Mountain and River Bell without harm. Though he looked miserable, at least he hadn’t been blasted away.

If what Qi Hai said before was true, then his effort and perseverance would earn the recognition of the Mountain and River Bell’s Artifact Spirit, making him its new master.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai looked up, his face full of hope as he gazed at the Mountain and River Bell.

But what he saw left him stunned.

Because the surface of the Mountain and River Bell was once again glowing with dazzling light. Yang Kai’s face instantly went pale, horror filling his expression.

He had witnessed this countless times over the past year and a half—every time the Mountain and River Bell’s surface glowed, it meant another chime was coming.

Another one?

Yang Kai was suddenly filled with despair and helplessness. With his current strength, after spending so long, managing to withstand eighty-one strikes was already the limit of limits. If there was even one more, he absolutely couldn’t endure it and would likely die.

His first thought was to retreat, to save his life above all else.

Whether Qi Hai’s method was useless or the records were wrong, he had already tried his best. Even if he failed, he had no regrets.

But right after, a wave of unwillingness surged up.

He had worked so hard—if he gave up now, wouldn’t all that effort be wasted?

A surge of hot blood suddenly welled up in his chest. Yang Kai shouted, not retreating but advancing, surging his Origin Qi and fiercely blasting it at the Mountain and River Bell.

What happened next surprised him—his Origin Qi poured smoothly into the Mountain and River Bell before him. This had never happened before. In all his attempts over the past year and a half, every time he tried, his power was always bounced back, only causing himself more harm.

But now, the Mountain and River Bell actually accepted his Origin Qi.

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, then was overjoyed.

Yet in the next instant, a shock from the depths of his heart and soul made his vision go black and his mind go blank—he fainted on the spot.

The Mountain and River Bell, however, shone brilliantly, radiating beams of light from its surface that enveloped Yang Kai, wrapping him completely. A Primordial Era aura filled the void. As time passed, this phenomenon gradually faded, and the Mountain and River Bell slowly shrank, eventually becoming only palm-sized and falling beside Yang Kai.

Who knows how long passed before Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, pain everywhere in his body. Even moving a thought made his head throb as if it were being torn apart, making him curse involuntarily.

He remembered clearly what happened before he fainted. The first thing he did upon waking was to check on the Mountain and River Bell.

He really wanted to know whether he had succeeded in subduing this Primordial Era treasure.

But when he looked up, the place where the Mountain and River Bell had been was empty. The Primordial Era treasure was nowhere to be seen.

Yang Kai’s face darkened, thinking it had once again vanished into the void. A wave of disappointment surged in his heart. He had struggled in this void rift for so long for the Mountain and River Bell, only for it to end with nothing…

Anyone would find that hard to accept.

But soon, Yang Kai sensed something was off.

Because there was a mysterious connection in the dark, drawing his gaze to the side.

In his sight, a palm-sized little bell floated quietly at his side, looking ancient and plain, completely unremarkable.

“Mountain and River Bell!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

Though this Primordial Era treasure had shrunk countless times, he still recognized it at a glance.

Overjoyed, he reached out, and the Mountain and River Bell flew into his palm. The vague connection instantly became much clearer.

Yang Kai was silent for a moment, then finally grinned.

Qi Hai’s method was correct. As long as one could withstand the eighty-one strikes of this Primordial Era treasure, one could gain its recognition and become its master. Back then, the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor had succeeded this way, and so had he.

It’s just that the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor subdued it when he was at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. With the Mountain and River Bell, he was able to glimpse higher Heavenly Dao and ascend to the Great Emperor Realm.

But he himself was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, far weaker than the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor had been, so it took a year and a half of effort.

Though it took a long time, Yang Kai felt an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.

He played with the Mountain and River Bell in his palm for a while. Once he was sure he had subdued it, he happily tried to put it away.

But to Yang Kai’s surprise, he couldn’t store it within himself. Puzzled, he tried to refine it with Origin Qi, but strangely, he couldn’t.

In other words, though the Mountain and River Bell now belonged to him and he could wield its power, he couldn’t refine it or store it inside himself.

Could this be a trait of Primordial Era treasures? After all, it was a Secret Treasure born at the dawn of the world, not man-made, so it was reasonable for it to differ from today’s Secret Treasures.

But Yang Kai didn’t dwell on it. He was still badly injured and now wasn’t the time to study the Mountain and River Bell in detail. He’d have to get familiar with it slowly in the future.

After putting away the Mountain and River Bell, Yang Kai finally began to heal.

Five days later, he was fully recovered.

Compared to a year and a half ago, Yang Kai’s aura had grown far deeper and more profound. In the process of subduing the Mountain and River Bell, he hadn’t just endured hardship—each time he was struck by the bell, his Divine Sense had grown stronger. Not only that, but he had also faintly sensed the ancient, primordial power contained within the Mountain and River Bell.

It was a power that made all living things submit, incomparably strange.

It’s hard to imagine how strong the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor was back when he possessed the Mountain and River Bell.

But even such a powerful person was no match for the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. In that battle among the Great Emperors, a total of four Great Emperors were killed by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Throughout history, the number one in the Star Realm—truly deserved!

This made Yang Kai think of that one-eyed giant demon. That giant demon was also a powerful expert from ancient times, bloodthirsty and murderous. Countless ancient masters besieged it, but it killed countless of them in return. Even after it died, its single giant eye couldn’t be destroyed and was sealed outside Fenglin City by those ancient masters.

Whether it was the one-eyed giant demon or the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, both were vicious beings who saw all living things as grass, life and death decided on a whim. But such slaughter went against the cycle of Heaven’s Dao and would surely bring disaster.

A sudden insight arose in Yang Kai’s heart. Vaguely, his future path seemed much clearer, and even the Origin Qi in his body began to change in a mysterious way.

Emperor Yuan transformation!

Yang Kai was overjoyed, realizing he had taken another big step toward the Emperor Realm.

From Dao Origin Realm to Emperor Realm, one’s internal power would undergo a complete transformation. Dao Origin Realm cultivators had Origin Qi, while those in the Emperor Realm had Emperor Yuan—the difference in quality was immense.

Normally, after breaking through to the Emperor Realm, a cultivator’s Origin Qi would gradually transform into Emperor Yuan, just like how Void King Realm cultivators’ power changed when they advanced to Dao Origin Realm. This transformation was always a long process.

Unlike the Dao Origin Realm, where one could take Origin Condensing Pills to speed up the process, there was no shortcut for the transformation to Emperor Yuan—only diligent cultivation and the passage of time.

The Tianzhao Palace’s Qiu Ze, whom Yang Kai killed earlier, was someone who had only recently broken through to the Emperor Realm. Though he had the cultivation of the Emperor Realm, his foundation was still unstable, and he hadn’t converted much Emperor Yuan, so he couldn’t display the full strength of the Emperor Realm. That’s why Yang Kai could kill him so easily.

If it had been someone like Gao Xueting, Yang Kai might not have been able to win with his strength at the time.

Gao Xueting had broken through to the Emperor Realm years ago and had long since fully converted her Emperor Yuan. Her strength was far above Qiu Ze’s.

And now, the Origin Qi in Yang Kai’s body was transforming into Emperor Yuan. This was the clearest sign that he was about to break through to the Emperor Realm.

Maybe he just needed an opportunity, or maybe just time—eventually, he would be able to glimpse the mysteries of the next realm.

He had subdued the Mountain and River Bell, touched the threshold of the Emperor Realm, gathered so much Origin Power, and even obtained the True Phoenix Fire—this trip to the Shattered Star Sea had truly not been in vain. He didn’t know what others had gained, but for him, it was already worth it.

For a moment, he felt refreshed and clear-headed. He looked around, reached out, and tore open the space barrier, stepping out from the void rift where he had spent a year and a half.

What he saw was still the desolate, ruined landscape of the Shattered Star Sea.

But this place was no longer where he had first entered the void. Yang Kai had no idea where in the Shattered Star Sea he was now.

There was no one around, but the Seven-Pointed Star Seal on the back of his hand faintly sensed some energy fluctuations coming from a very distant place.

He thought for a moment, then leapt toward the source of those fluctuations.

Since there were people over there, it meant there must be something good.

He wasn’t planning to steal from others—he just thought he might be able to exchange information, maybe learn something he didn’t know.

After about two hours, he saw a shattered star in the distance, and the Star Seal fluctuations were coming from that star.
