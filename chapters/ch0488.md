## Chapter 488 — I Did It On Purpose

The dust settled, and Yang Kang had already been defeated.

But in a certain corner of the battlefield, Dong Fatty was ravaging the young master of the Lü Family, Lü Song. Lü Song was no weakling either; just a few days ago at the shore of Po Jing Lake, he had exchanged blows with Dong Qinghan, so they were both familiar with each other's strengths and weaknesses.

Tonight, Dong Qinghan had sought him out intentionally, and Lü Song accepted the challenge without hesitation.

Unexpectedly, after a few days apart, Dong Qinghan’s strength had greatly increased. After a fierce battle, Lü Song was utterly defeated, never even able to strike back. Dong Qinghan relentlessly hunted him, leaving him utterly battered and thoroughly humiliated.

Is this guy on some sort of blood-boiling medicine? Why is he so fierce tonight? Lü Song, covered in bruises and bloodied, fled in terror.

“Run! You run for me, young master! Run faster!” Dong Qinghan’s face was cold and expressionless, but his fat body exuded an unrestrained grace. In a flash, he blocked Lü Song’s path and casually slapped him across the face.

Lü Song raised his hand to block, but Dong Qinghan's move changed direction so quickly that he didn’t even see it coming.

Smack! Half of Lü Song’s face went numb.

There is an old saying: when beating someone, don’t hit the face; when insulting, don’t reveal flaws. But Dong Qinghan’s despicable behavior infuriated Lü Song to the point he nearly vomited blood. He was after all the young master of a first-rate family, and with so many eyes watching on the battlefield, how was he supposed to hold his ground in the future if word got out?

“Dong Qinghan, don’t push me too far!” Lü Song hastily retreated and tried to put some distance between himself and Dong Fatty.

“I am pushing you too far. So what?” Dong Fatty slapped down another palm.

Smack…

Lü Song was so maddened his judgment was lost. Moves he might have blocked before now slipped through, and another heavy palm struck him. His eyes were bloodshot.

“You senseless fool, get out of War City!” Dong Qinghan spat while slapping him relentlessly.

“Cousin!” Lü Song screamed hoarsely, shouting into the void.

“Fuck your cousin!” Dong Qinghan retorted, giving him another slap.

Above, Qiu Yimeng glanced down lightly, then shook her head and ignored Lü Song’s desperate calls for help.

When Yang Kai had driven him out of the mansion that day, Qiu Yimeng had privately approached him the next day, advising he leave War City as soon as possible and not meddle in the succession war any longer. She meant well, knowing he lacked foresight and might offend the wrong people, bringing disaster to the Lü Family.

But this brat not only refused to heed the advice — after healing his wounds, he even sought out Yang Kang as a backing to oppose Yang Kai.

Now, seeking help again was too late.

Dong Qinghan would not kill him. This kind of lesson and humiliation might be just what he needed to wake up and realize that the succession war was not something he could interfere with.

All was silent. After Yang Kang descended from the sky, everyone had ceased fighting. Only Dong Qinghan continued to mercilessly scold Lü Song, whose screams sounded like those of a slaughtered pig, chilling onlookers to the bone.

Yang Kang’s mansion was desolate. The losses in this battle were severe, with over half the forces wiped out even before the battle truly began. No one had expected such an outcome.

Everyone thought that although Yang Kang’s strength was not the strongest, it was at least not the weakest. Even if attacked, it should not have been brought down so easily.

But the bloody reality sobered them all.

Without a sound, Yang Kai had already amassed strength that surpassed every other member of the Yang Family.

Looking up at that figure in the sky, many showed expressions of despair and powerlessness.

“Bring me the command flag!” Yang Kai barked coldly.

Xiao Shun staggered, then boldly entered the main hall of Yang Kang’s mansion, took the command flag, and walked out openly. No one stopped or dared to stop him.

Losing the command flag meant Yang Kang was truly out of the contest.

Lying on the ground, Yang Kang slowly closed his eyes. From now on, everything in War City was no longer of concern to him.

“I give you all a chance to live!” Yang Kai shouted up to the surviving martial artists at Yang Kang’s mansion.

Everyone held their breath, listening intently.

“Gather all supplies from my Fifth Brother’s mansion and bring them to mine. From now on, do not set foot in War City again. If you do... death is inevitable!”

No one answered, nor did anyone protest such brazen robbery. It was exactly what Yang Kai deserved.

After tonight’s slaughter, these warriors probably no longer had the courage to stay. Moreover, Yang Kang had promised Yang Kai this condition, and with him speaking on their behalf, those who followed would likely obey.

“Haven’t heard clearly? If you haven’t, no one needs to leave you can all stay.” Yang Kai looked down coldly and menacingly.

“Understood, understood, Ninth Young Master! Rest assured!” someone immediately yelled in fear of another massacre from Yang Kai’s faction.

“Good.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“We’d better head back quickly.” Qiu Yimeng said with a grave and uneasy expression. “We originally wanted a quick victory, but you just had to drag things out so long. There aren’t many left in the mansion, and who knows if Yang Shen or Yang Ying are moving on their side.”

Yang Kai’s mansion now had only half its forces stationed there. If Yang Shen and Yang Ying received news, if they were ruthless enough, they could mobilize many troops and seize the command flag while Yang Kai’s rear was vulnerable.

Even with Qu Gaoyi guarding, it wouldn’t be secure!

“I did it on purpose!” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“What do you mean?”

“Sixth Brother and Seventh Brother should already have moved, right?” Yang Kai answered casually.

“Are you sure they’ve moved?” Qiu Yimeng’s face paled.

“Of course.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Then you’re not worried at all?” Qiu Yimeng was almost frantic, truly unable to understand why Yang Kai deliberately delayed so long to let Yang Shen and Yang Ying learn what was happening.

“Why worry? The command flag is safe.” Yang Kai shook his head. Although Qu Gaoyi alone guarding the main hall was not enough to guarantee the command flag’s safety, there was still Meng Wuya in the mansion.

Shopkeeper Meng claimed he would not interfere in the succession war, but when a crisis arose, he would not just sit by. Yang Kai trusted him.

“Tonight is an opportunity!” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “My place is closer to Sixth Brother’s mansion, so let’s go there.”

Qiu Yimeng was stunned, staring dumbfounded at him. “How much do you plan to do tonight?”

“As much as I can.” Yang Kai replied casually.

Tonight was indeed a rare opportunity.

Yang Kai had refined a Mystery-Grade treasure many days ahead; the Earth Demon’s return; Ying Jiu’s recovery — all were advantages he could exploit.

But those advantages could only be revealed once. Next time, when the brothers were mentally prepared, the effect would diminish.

Yang Zhao’s mansion.

Yang Zhao smiled helplessly. He led a group of martial artists, facing off against Yang Wei in front of the mansion.

The two brothers had talked all night, their tongues worn dry. But no fight broke out.

Yang Zhao knew his eldest brother’s purpose was to restrain him, preventing him from deploying troops, so naturally he had no intention of starting a battle.

Suddenly, someone hurriedly came beside Yang Zhao, whispering something. Yang Zhao’s expression changed drastically.

At the same time, someone came to Yang Wei and told him the same.

Moment later, the two brothers exchanged glances. Yang Zhao said, “Big Brother, are you clear about Ninth Brother’s background?”

“I know a little, but didn’t expect him to be so strong.” Yang Wei nodded lightly.

Yang Kang’s elimination was expected by both. But Yang Kai’s side suffered nearly no casualties — that surprised them.

Both Yang Wei and Yang Zhao had believed that even if Ninth Brother could defeat Fifth Brother, it would be a bloody and narrow victory. After all, one was on the attack while the other on defense, and the latter had the advantage of heaven and earth.

Now with the news, both showed surprise and fear even in their eyes.

“Big Brother, listen to me—how about teaming up with me? Ninth Brother is so strong. Winning Fifth Brother only makes him bigger. If we don’t join forces now, there won’t be a chance later.”

Yang Wei frowned but did not answer immediately.

Yang Zhao smiled, “Big Brother, what are you hesitating for? Ninth Brother is strong now. If I’m right, his next targets will be Sixth or Seventh Brother. After defeating them, we’ll be targets. Do you still dream of taking me out before teaming with him?”

Yang Wei shook his head. “Teaming up is only for this time. But I doubt he’ll want to eliminate Sixth and Seventh Brothers any time soon. When he really turns his sights to us, then it’s not too late to join forces.”

Yang Zhao thought for a moment and nodded, “Fine.”

“There’s nothing here now. I’ll return first.” Yang Wei said no more and led his troops away in a grand procession.

Watching Yang Wei’s figure disappear, Yang Zhao furrowed his brow and muttered, “Ninth Brother, Ninth Brother, what kind of people do you really have under your command? How could you pull this off?”

After hesitating, he quickly summoned the messenger and inquired in detail about the battle at Yang Kang’s mansion.

Upon learning of the Earth Demon’s bloody and merciless methods, Yang Zhao’s expression darkened. “Isn’t this a demon?”

“According to this subordinate, it truly is demonic behavior! The martial artists in Fifth Young Master’s camp were completely destroyed by this one man. Without him, Fifth Young Master would never have lost so badly.”

Before the treasure war, the brothers’ forces were roughly equal; even with some differences, they were not great. So, no one dared strike first, fearing others would take advantage.

But after the treasure war, Yang Kai’s forces suddenly opened a gap in strength over the others, baffling Yang Zhao.

Who exactly is that cruel demon? Why had no news of him emerged before?

“Xinrou.” Yang Zhao called softly.

“Second Young Master, your orders?” Ye Xinrou appeared gracefully and asked softly.

“Have you received any news on the expert I asked you to investigate?”

Ye Xinrou shook her head slowly. “None. That person vanished after appearing at Po Jing Lake.”

“Keep searching!” Yang Zhao frowned. “We must find that person, and if possible, bring him under our control!”

The mysterious expert who appeared at Po Jing Lake and seized the eighth Mystery-Grade treasure caught not only Yang Kai’s attention, but Yang Zhao’s as well.

Such a ghostlike expert—if recruited—would render Yang Kai powerless in Yang Zhao’s eyes. Holding onto this hope, Yang Zhao spared no effort in the search, but unfortunately no news had come yet.
