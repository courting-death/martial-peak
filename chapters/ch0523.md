## Chapter 523 — We're Even Now

Qiu Yimeng and the others instantly showed tense expressions; they all saw Yang Zhao’s restlessness.

Moreover, under the influence of the sinister energy within Yang Kai, it was difficult for Yang Zhao to properly compose himself and handle the current situation appropriately.

He too was affected.

As a fellow scion of the Yang Family, and even the second young master of the younger generation, Yang Zhao’s own accomplishments were far inferior to Yang Kai’s, fueling envy and jealousy in his heart. These negative emotions intensified until his eyes were slightly reddened.

“Second Young Master, hesitation only brings chaos!” Xiang Chu coldly yelled, striking while the iron was hot.

At last, Yang Zhao made up his mind, nodding heavily before waving his hand to issue an order into the air. With a cold shout, he commanded, “Stop him at all costs!”

The two Blood Servants beside Yang Zhao hesitated, their expressions troubled.

As one of them had said earlier, everyone in the Blood Servants Hall deeply respected and was grateful to Yang Kai; but now, Yang Zhao was ordering them to stop Yang Kai’s ascent. They were at a loss.

Yang Kai was at a crucial moment. If he were truly disturbed during his ascension and failed, it was very likely he would perish and his soul scatter. Even if the worst didn’t happen, he might be stuck at the Ninth Stage of the True Yuan Realm.

How could the two Blood Servants bear to inflict such harm?

They naturally felt a strong aversion. Yet, Yang Zhao was their master, their young lord, and when commands came, they had to act.

“Do you think I don’t exist?” Di Mo chuckled grotesquely. Having watched the scene unfold, Di Mo’s blood boiled with killing intent. Seeing Yang Zhao issue such reckless orders, he immediately shouted and, together with Tang Yuxian, blocked the two Blood Servants.

“Yang Zhao, you’ve gone mad!” Qiu Yimeng angrily shouted as well, leading everyone in the mansion upward. They tightly surrounded Yang Kai, determined to protect him at all costs.

“Whoever dares block us dies!” Yang Zhao snarled, issuing attack orders to the martial artists in his mansion. His malevolence magnified, Yang Zhao no longer cared about the means.

Behind the crowd, Xiang Chu lowly chuckled with a twisted smile, looking venomously at Yang Kai in the sky—seemingly unable to move and only able to endure the Baptism of the Heavenly Energy—with a look of delight on his face.

Yang Kai cast him a cold glance and calmly said, “Nan Sheng is dead. You won’t escape today either.”

Xiang Chu took a few steps back but then steadied himself, shouting fiercely, “Yang Kai, stop scaring me! Get through your current crisis first!”

The martial artists on both sides had already begun their battle. Di Mo and Tang Yuxian combined forces to not only stop the two Blood Servants by Yang Zhao’s side but also hold back a dozen or so Divine Roaming Realm masters from his mansion.

Though Qiu Yimeng and the others were fewer in number, they clustered around Yang Kai, watching over and assisting him. For now, they could prevent the enemy from breaking through the defenses. Brilliant light from Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure martial skills lit up the dark War City.

The violent battle erupted instantly, with fierce energy unleashed on all sides!

Inside the teahouse, Yang Wei shook his head with a hint of sorrow. “Second Brother has gone too far.”

Liu Qingyao nodded lightly. Although a Succession War called for ruthless measures, this was Yang Kai’s most critical moment. Any mishap now would affect his entire future.

As they spoke, Yang Wei slowly stood, shedding his disguise to reveal his true appearance.

“Is the Eldest Young Master about to move?” Liu Qingyao asked with a sidelong glance.

“Indeed,” Yang Wei nodded. “As the Eldest Young Master of the Yang Family, I shall act.”

Without another word, he dashed toward the battlefield, leading the Blood Servants by his side.

Liu Qingyao was momentarily stunned but then laughed: “Truly a gentleman, the Eldest Young Master!”

Yang Wei’s intervention was on behalf of himself as the Eldest Young Master, not as a contender in the Succession War. This meant he acted purely on his own accord.

He could easily have mobilized his mansion’s forces to surprise-attack Yang Kai’s estate or even join forces with Yang Kai’s men to assault Yang Zhao.

Yet, he did not. Clearly, he did not want to take advantage of another’s misfortune, earning Liu Qingyao’s praise.

Shortly after, Yang Wei arrived beside Yang Kai. Seeing his appearance, Qiu Yimeng immediately grew wary and shouted coldly, “Eldest Young Master, what are you doing here?”

Yang Wei saw her suspicion and fear but said nothing. Instead, he gave a subtle nod to a Blood Servant beside him. The Blood Servant, at the Eighth Stage of Divine Roaming Realm, immediately bowed and charged into the chaotic battlefield.

Qiu Yimeng’s expression softened slightly, a blush on her cheeks as she said, “Thank you for your assistance, Eldest Young Master!”

Yang Wei nodded quietly, showing no sign of seeking credit.

Yang Kai watched this scene, his heart warming. He nodded to his eldest brother. The two exchanged a look; everything was understood without words.

Below, Xiang Chu kept taunting and provoking Yang Kai, trying to shake his mind with insults.

He lacked the courage to attack directly, so he resorted to this despicable method, hoping to disrupt Yang Kai’s mindset and cause his ascension to fail. That was his deepest wish.

Everyone at Yang Kai’s estate had their faces darkened by his obscene words, but no one could spare time to retaliate. This only made Xiang Chu more arrogant, completely disregarding others.

Yang Kai looked at him with disgust, then suddenly took out a small doll made from pale blue strands of hair and flicked it with his fingers several times.

In the distant crowd, a petite woman dressed in black suddenly screamed, clutching her forehead with both hands. She looked both aggrieved and helpless as she gazed upwards.

Yang Kai motioned again with his fingers.

The woman dared not hesitate and rushed forward, shouting loudly as she ran, “I'm coming! Stop flicking it!”

Hearing her panicked voice, Yang Kai ceased his flicking.

Seeing he had no intention of continuing, Shui Ling took a deep breath, her eyes full of anger. She grit her teeth, “You bastard, what exactly are you trying to do?”

“Help me this once, and I’ll give this back to you!” Yang Kai endured the intense pain and said as he raised the doll in his hand.

“Really?” Shui Ling was overjoyed, gazing at him with excitement and hope.

Yang Kai flicked his hand, tossing the doll made from her hair to her. Shui Ling grabbed it deftly, clutching it like a precious treasure as she laughed heartily.

Since the last time she was tormented by this Soul Binding Curse, Shui Ling had hated it deeply, always fantasizing about stealing it back from Yang Kai and regaining her freedom.

That was why she lingered in War City, secretly looking for an opportunity.

But time had passed without a chance, and she hadn’t even dared to set foot in Yang Kai’s mansion. Unexpectedly, this sudden incident allowed her to succeed so easily.

Shui Ling suddenly felt the shackles binding her body vanish with the doll’s possession. She was free once more.

She solemnly tucked the doll inside her chest and even patted it before relaxing, tilting her head curiously to look at Yang Kai and grinning, “Aren’t you afraid I’ll run off with this?”

“Do as you please! Without your help, I’d be in trouble anyway. But anyone who dares fool me never ends well,” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

Shui Ling curled her lips. “Still boasting at a time like this? Hmph!”

Then after a pause, she added, “But you’re lucky. You weren’t mistaken; I’m not one to break my word.”

Though Yang Kai had tormented her several times, he always exercised restraint, only causing her pain without injury. Moreover, while he held the doll, if he had really wanted to harm her, she would have been powerless to resist.

It was because of this that Shui Ling realized this man was not entirely cruel—his control stemmed only from caution.

“Tell me, what do you need me to do?” she asked.

“Capture that man for me.”

Yang Kai cast a glance at Xiang Chu far away.

“No problem,” Shui Ling giggled, casually waving her hand. A nearly transparent flow of water suddenly shot out, like a Divine Pill-like rope with a will of its own, weaving through the chaotic crowd and precisely binding the still shouting Xiang Chu.

Xiang Chu panicked and tried to resist with True Yuan, but the techniques wielded by a Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage warrior were not something he could withstand.

No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t sever the watery bindings.

“Come on now!” Shui Ling sweetly scolded as she pulled back her hand, dragging Xiang Chu—still yelling frantically—quickly to her side.

“Behave yourself and don’t move, or you’ll regret it!” Shui Ling scrunched her delicate nose, grabbing Xiang Chu’s shoulder and tossing him casually to Yang Kai with effortless ease, as if it were no big deal.

Seeing Yang Kai’s cold expression, Xiang Chu abruptly paled, flailing his hands midair as he cried out, “Ninth Young Master, have mercy!”

Yang Kai sneered, “Regret now? It’s too late!”

Then…

From the clouds above, a streak of black energy slammed into Yang Kai’s body, rampaging wildly.

Influenced by this violent energy, Xiang Chu, who was close by, was affected—the skin exposed suddenly spread a layer of dark aura. His eyes bulged as immense internal pressure seemed to burst out.

With a muffled sound, Xiang Chu exploded into a blood mist, leaving no bones.

The fierce battlefield momentarily froze. Everyone stared in disbelief at the blood light blossoming in the sky, never expecting the Xiang Family’s young master to die so miserably.

First Nan Sheng was killed, now Xiang Chu reduced to nothing. Yang Kai... truly did as he said.

Even Yang Zhao failed to protect the two.

“We’re even now,” Shui Ling said proudly to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded and slowly closed his eyes. His ascension was imminent. He had no time for distractions.

At this moment, he could only steel himself to withstand the Baptism of Heavenly Might and wait for the breakthrough of his Sea of Consciousness to the Divine Roaming Realm.
