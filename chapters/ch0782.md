## Chapter 782 — Tempering

Blood stained the earth; Yang Kai looked wretched, yet his opponent fought on with increasing ferocity, seizing every advantage.

The burly man, at the height of his assault, sent Yang Kai flying into the air with a single punch; as he fell, another blow struck his back and drove him into the soil.

Dust billowed and everyone’s view of the battlefield was obscured; with the Death Arena’s outer barrier and sealing arrays in place, even those at the Saint Realm using Divine Sense could scarcely parse what was happening—only a vague impression that the fight had ended.

How dull, many thought inwardly.

Before that thought finished, a fierce Violent Aura suddenly spread from the dust, whipping up a gale across the ground, and in an instant the dust scattered.

When everyone could clearly see the scene, exclamations burst forth in unison.

Yang Kai, who should have been prostrate or fatally wounded, at that moment used his uninjured large hand to press his opponent down.

That hand covered the burly man’s cheek—far from broad, yet like a falling canopy of sky; no matter how the man struggled, he could not rise.

In that split second no one had seen what transpired within the dust; when it cleared to reveal this tableau, it was genuinely startling.

They had seen desperate counterattacks and comeback victories before, but never one so bewildering as today’s.

In that instant the mask on Yang Kai’s face seemed to harden into a cruelty of its own.

Wind and thunder forces surged, pouring from Yang Kai’s palm into the burly man’s body and forming an intertwined field of slaughter within him.

Thud...

The hulking man simply exploded into a cloud of blood mist—there were no bones left.

In the stands, Xueli’s eyes brightened; she stared at Yang Kai in startled disbelief, a faint smile lifting her delicate red lips.

“What is his true strength?” Xueli suddenly asked An Ling’er in a low voice.

“I’m not telling you!” An Ling’er kept shaking her head.

“Not telling me?” Xueli did not grow angry; instead she wore a thoughtful expression and pursed a smile. “Then I’ll find out for myself.”

Watching Yang Kai below in the Death Arena, one arm hanging and his body lacerated as he trudged toward the corridor, Xueli suddenly felt this human youth must possess some unusual skill.

After a long silence the stands erupted into loud argument; most people seemed unable to accept such an outcome.

Yang Kai had returned to the corridor. Yu Mo’s eyes glinted coldly as he fixed his gaze on him.

The sallow-faced man gaped, stunned in place—his eyes nearly popped from his sockets.

Not even the time of an incense stick had passed before this boastful human youth actually killed his opponent.

“The match looked brutal enough, didn’t it?” Yang Kai removed the mask from his face and asked Yu Mo.

Yu Mo’s mouth twitched and he inclined his head slightly.

Not only brutal, but convincingly so—without a single flaw. Even Yu Mo had thought Yang Kai was surely done for, only to be astonished at the last moment.

That kid has guts. Isn’t he afraid that after taking such violent blows he won’t be able to stand?

Yang Kai then shook his arm; the snapped limb made a crisp sound as it mended, instantly restored.

“For the next match, set me against someone at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm—then you’ll earn more, I’ll get a bigger cut, and I can gather my ransom sooner and leave earlier!” Yang Kai grinned.

Yu Mo looked a little dazed.

Back in the palace, Yang Kai recuperated.

Apparently the victory improved his treatment considerably; the food brought to him included many tonics, and Xueli even permitted An Ling’er to visit him once.

The two of them talked for a long while before An Ling’er left.

Three days later Yang Kai was scheduled for his second bout.

Perhaps because of his previous bizarre performance, his reappearance wearing the mask drew significant attention.

This time, his opponent was indeed a Second Stage Transcendent.

After a fierce struggle Yang Kai barely survived and once more emerged victorious, causing those demonic folk to exclaim in disbelief.

Fighting above your rank is a feat only a few can accomplish; especially after the Transcendent Realm, even a Stage of difference makes a gulf in real combat power.

A Second Stage Transcendent cultivator can put a First Stage Transcendent to death with ease, yet that common knowledge was overturned by Yang Kai.

This time Yang Kai still carried the sealing array Yu Mo had placed and could not employ his peak strength; unlike the staged performance previously, this battle was him truly fighting for his life.

In that life-and-death struggle he felt he comprehended many things and was elated—such a fight to the death was of tremendous benefit to his growth.

He no longer recoiled from this way of fighting; instead he began to look forward to it.

It was an opportunity—an opportunity to temper himself.

A warrior’s advancement isn’t only achieved by secluded study; life-or-death battles often yield greater gains than closed-door cultivation—so long as one survives.

Understanding this, Yang Kai constantly urged Yu Mo to arrange ever stronger opponents for him.

Yu Mo was bewildered; the way he looked at Yang Kai changed as if he were looking at a madman. None of the captured foreign fighters had ever requested to be sent into the Death Arena like this.

Xueli, however, was open-minded—when he made the request she immediately set about arranging it.

The opponents assigned to him grew progressively stronger and the matches increasingly arduous, yet each time Yang Kai managed to conjure a miracle at the most improbable moment.

Over three months Yang Kai fought fourteen bouts in total; all his opponents were Second Stage Transcendents—some human, some yao, some demon—each placed in the Death Arena for different reasons, and all ended up as Yang Kai’s defeated foes.

Yang Kai reaped great rewards: not only insights born from life-and-death struggle, but after devouring their soul energies he absorbed their understandings of the Dao of martial combat.

His own growth accelerated astonishingly.

During those three months Yang Kai inadvertently made himself a reputation. In Sand City everyone knew that Xueli had under her command a strange masked human at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm who had slain a dozen Second Stage Transcendent warriors.

The betting odds for Yang Kai’s matches in the Death Arena were revised again and again, but that did nothing to curb the enthusiasm of those who placed wagers on him.

As the house master Xueli naturally didn’t lose in the gambling, yet Yang Kai’s terrifying rate of growth left her with a hint of unease.

She more than anyone else could see how Yang Kai had earned such leaps in strength through those near-death battles.

One day a messenger came to Xueli’s palace; he spoke with her at length and departed satisfied.

An hour later Yang Kai was summoned.

In the inner chamber Xueli lay propped on the bed, her hips raised and her bosom pressed beneath her, hands supporting her chin in an exquisitely alluring pose.

An Ling’er was half-kneeling at her side, loosening her joints and kneading her shoulders.

A mature, intoxicating fragrance filled the room and lifted the spirits.

Yu Mo led Yang Kai into the chamber, head bowed and standing aside; he did not dare meet Xueli’s eyes.

Yang Kai stood at the edge of the bed and scanned Xueli’s splendid form, his eyes brightening.

Though this demon general's heart might be venomous, there was no denying her figure’s voluptuous maturity—she was not like An Ling’er’s youthful freshness; she was a woman fully ripe.

A woman like that would be a fatal temptation to any man.

Yet someone as formidable as Xueli would likely not be moved by any man—only power, surpassing all else, could sway her heart.

After a moment Xueli finally spoke: “Just now Gou Qiong sent people here.”

“Hm?” Yang Kai frowned. “Is it about me?”

“Yes. Gou Qiong appears intent on killing you.”

“And how did you reply?” Yang Kai regarded her coldly and taunted, “You didn’t sell me out, did you?”

“I had that thought, but I refused him!”

“Why?”

“Because he’s Gou Qiong!” Xueli sneered. “I won’t simply act according to his wishes. However, his envoy made a proposal I accepted.”

Yang Kai did not press; he simply waited for her to explain.

“Tomorrow in the Death Arena you will fight to the death with the person Gou Qiong dispatches. If you win, you will be able to raise your ransom; if you lose, you will lose everything—including your life!” Xueli said lightly.

Yang Kai lifted an eyebrow and laughed. “The man Gou Qiong is sending must be strong, right?”

Xueli glanced his way and casually replied, “A Third Stage Transcendent.”

At her words Yu Mo, who had been bowing his head, showed a flicker of change in expression.

“You intend to team up to kill me, then.” Yang Kai grinned, displaying no trace of panic.

“He truly wants you dead, but I want to see what your limits are!” Xueli’s pretty face chilled. “Don’t think I can’t tell—you’ve been hiding your strength all along; you appear to have many techniques you haven’t used.”

Yang Kai shrugged, giving nothing away.

“So I’m very much looking forward to tomorrow—don’t disappoint me.”

“Then watch and see!”

Xueli let out a light, cold laugh and ordered Yu Mo, “Remove the sealing array on him; I want to see if he can survive against Gou Qiong’s man.”

Yu Mo inclined his head slightly and unleashed a thread of True Yuan, dispelling the sealing array that had been suppressing Yang Kai’s strength.

“One thing I need to confirm: if I win tomorrow, will only my ransom be raised? What about An Ling’er’s?”

Xueli looked at him and smiled. "Of course it's only for you. But... I'll give you a chance: if you win tomorrow, I'll let both of you go!"

“You said that!” Yang Kai laughed heartily. “A demon general’s word should be trusted, right? I hope you won’t go back on it!”

Xueli had already closed her beautiful eyes and offered no reply.
