## Chapter 1777 — Is Your Sect Recruiting?

"Little Senior Sister is indeed a Void King-Grade alchemist," Yang Kai said with a nod.

Ghost Ancestor suddenly drew in a long breath and asked in a deep voice, "On which Cultivation Star is your Sect located? Is your Sect recruiting? Do you need high‑level elders or similar, hmm, an Honored Guest would do — failing that, just give me some nominal title, anything will do."

The Ghost Ancestor could no longer remain calm.

Although he had long wandered alone and lived as he pleased, the bitterness of it was something only he truly understood.

For example, when he wanted to refine a Spiritual Pill there was no one he could entrust, and when he wanted to seclude himself to cultivate some secret art there was no one to stand guard; even the materials he needed to cultivate had to be sought out by his own hand.

Those trivial matters wasted huge swathes of his time.

But the Void King Realm experts of the great powers were completely different: their status was lofty, and with a single order countless disciples would scramble to carry it out; what those Void King Realm experts needed to do was simply to cultivate in peace.

So at times the Ghost Ancestor felt a strong envy of those Void King Realm experts belonging to powerful forces.

However, if he were truly asked to join any faction, he would certainly be unwilling. After all, he had no desire to be bound by others’ restraints, nor to tie himself to any particular force.

Yet if it were the Sect Yang Kai belonged to, things would be entirely different!

This Sect had three Void King-Grade Alchemy Grandmasters seated as its pillars! That single fact alone exerted a fatal attraction on the Ghost Ancestor.

Moreover, he took a liking to Yang Kai. Their relationship was not bad, so he felt no resistance to Yang Kai's Sect.

Seeing the Ghost Ancestor so eager, almost ready to volunteer himself, Yang Kai smiled inwardly.

He had not expected the Ghost Ancestor to suddenly conceive the idea of joining the Lingxiao Sect, but on second thought it made sense.

With himself and Xia Ningshang both being Void King-Grade Alchemy Grandmasters, recruiting a Void King Realm expert to Lingxiao Sect would not be too difficult. Yang Kai was not particularly keen on such things — Void King Realm experts were rare — but the fact that Lingxiao Sect had none now did not mean they would never have any.

Ye Xijun was already practically at the Void King Realm threshold; in time she would surely ascend to that Realm, only lacking the right opportunity.

If the Ghost Ancestor wished to join, Yang Kai could accept him. After this stretch of time together Yang Kai had seen that the Ghost Ancestor was not as sinister as he appeared on the surface.

His ghostly aura was merely a result of the cultivation method he practiced.

As his thoughts drifted, Yang Kai grinned and said, “My Sect is called the Lingxiao Sect, located on the Dark Star. This junior may be unworthy, but I am its Sect Master…”

He gave the Ghost Ancestor a brief account of the Lingxiao Sect's situation.

When the Ghost Ancestor learned that Lingxiao Sect had actually been founded by Yang Kai himself he could not help but admire him; and upon learning that there was not a single Void King Realm expert within Lingxiao Sect, and that the entire Dark Star had only one newly promoted First Stage of the Void King Realm, he was positively elated.

He had originally thought that any force boasting several Void King-Grade Alchemy Grandmasters would surely not be weak, and would likely have many Void King Realm experts as well. If that were the case, his joining would merely be adding a blossom to brocade. But now it seemed that if he truly were to join, he would instantly become the foremost expert of the Lingxiao Sect—and even of the entire Dark Star!

That status differed utterly from what he had imagined; it would be supreme.

So the Ghost Ancestor grew even more enthusiastic and asked eagerly, "Yang Kai, look at me — I have been lonely my whole life. Ever since leaving the Floating Continent I have had nowhere to settle. How about I come to your Lingxiao Sect? I have no great demands: give me the title of an Honored Guest Elder so I can enjoy the care of Void King-Grade alchemists, occasionally refine a few Spiritual Pills for me, and I will be satisfied, heh heh..."

He spoke plainly and honestly.

Yang Kai laughed heartily. “For a figure like Elder to wish to join the Lingxiao Sect—how could I possibly refuse? I couldn’t ask for anything better!”

"Then it's settled?" The Ghost Ancestor's eyes brightened; although he had expected Yang Kai would probably not refuse, he still felt delighted when Yang Kai actually agreed.

In that way he could be close at hand to Void King-Grade alchemists; once he found the requisite materials there would be no lack of people to help him refine them — increasing his strength would become a simple matter.

The Ghost Ancestor could already picture the future: in his lifetime he would surely break through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and stand at the pinnacle, atop the Star Domain.

“It’s settled then!” Yang Kai agreed readily with a nod. “However, the title of Honored Guest Elder doesn’t quite befit Senior’s status. Let’s make it… Grand Elder instead.”

The Ghost Ancestor's body trembled and he stared at Yang Kai long and hard, his heart unable to calm for some time.

Although he had not joined many powers, he knew the difference between an Honored Guest Elder and a Grand Elder. An Honored Guest Elder might receive sect provisions, but it was merely a titular honor; such a person had virtually no authority.

A Grand Elder was different — a Grand Elder possessed real power; strictly speaking their authority was second only to the Sect Master, and in some forces the Grand Elder was supreme, able to mobilize the Sect's resources and disciples at will. When a Grand Elder issued an order it was absolute, and disciples would follow even into the flames and water to complete it.

That said, an Honored Guest Elder had its own advantages: when a Sect faced dangers an Honored Guest Elder could decide whether to help or not, enjoying great freedom, whereas a Grand Elder had to rise and fall with the Sect and share its fate.

Generally only those of the highest seniority and most extensive merit within a Sect could become Grand Elders.

The Ghost Ancestor had not expected Yang Kai to hand him the title of Grand Elder outright; although the risks were greater, the benefits and treatment were far superior.

"Boy Yang, you treat me with courtesy and I will repay you in earnest. Hmph, words are empty for now—but just you wait and see. As the Grand Elder, this old man will see to it that your disciples come to admire and respect me from the bottom of their hearts!” the Ghost Ancestor said in a deep voice.

Even at his advanced age he was stirred into a kind of hotblooded fervor and spoke boldly of grand ambitions.

“Senior, you’re being too serious. Since I’ve asked you to serve as the Grand Elder, of course I would never doubt you,” Yang Kai said with a light laugh.

"Still calling me 'Elder'?" the Ghost Ancestor laughed.

"Er... I pay my respects to the Grand Elder!" Yang Kai hurriedly cupped his fists and offered a serious bow.

“Sect Master, you too polite!” The Ghost Ancestor returned the salute and said, “From this day forth, this old man will be one of the Lingxiao Sect. I ask the Sect Master to look after me, and if there are any orders, do not hesitate to give them!"

After speaking the two exchanged a look and laughed out loud, as if they had just engaged in some secret, shameless plot together.

"Hmm, when this Lost Realm business is over I'll go back with you to the Sect to have a look," the Ghost Ancestor said longingly; he was curious what sort of Sect could produce someone like Yang Kai, and since he had chosen to join Lingxiao Sect he naturally wanted to see how the Sect operated.

“That’s simple. When the time comes, I’ll go with you. This news should indeed be sent back to the Sect,” Yang Kai nodded.

While they spoke Yang Kai's expression shifted and he said, "Grand Elder, I just thought of something."

"What is it?"

"We should split up to search; that way the area we can cover increases greatly and our finds will multiply. What do you think?"

Previously Yang Kai had not proposed this because, although he and the Ghost Ancestor were on good terms, they were not family; suggesting separation then might have caused misunderstanding.

But now it was different: since the Ghost Ancestor was effectively part of the Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai had no qualms about making the suggestion.

The Ghost Ancestor pondered and said, "If we split up the search area will indeed grow and our gains increase, but the space fissures here are numerous. In most cases I can detect them, but some are hidden too deeply for me to see. Without you beside me, I lack confidence."

Just like earlier — when the Seven Luminaries Divine Light struck, if Yang Kai had not found a place to hide, the Ghost Ancestor would have been swallowed by that light; the consequences would have been dire.

"Heh, since I suggested it there must be a way to let you also detect those fissures," Yang Kai said proudly, full of confidence.

"Oh? What method can let me find those fissures?" the Ghost Ancestor asked in surprise.

Yang Kai grinned, "I can leave a Spatial Mark on you so that you can sense those hidden fissures."

"You can do that?"

"It should be possible — let's try." Yang Kai was not entirely sure; in the past he could not have done such a thing, but after devouring and fusing with that Spatial Spiral his comprehension of spatial power had reached a new height, so the proposal might actually be achievable.

"If you can truly do it, then it will undoubtedly be an excellent method," the Ghost Ancestor nodded.

With the Ghost Ancestor's consent Yang Kai took a deep breath, activated his Spatial Force, and extended a finger; the Spatial Force on his fingertip surged, a spiral power coalescing into form.

In the next moment Yang Kai lightly tapped the Ghost Ancestor's chest.

The spiral force erupted, forming a mark that remained on the Ghost Ancestor's body.

"Hmm... so this is Spatial Force?" the Ghost Ancestor murmured in surprise. Even as an expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm he was stunned by the strangeness of the space power; through the mark on his chest he could clearly feel the fluctuations of spatial force spreading outward and relaying information about the surroundings.

Several places returned unusual feedback; the Ghost Ancestor looked toward those spots and discovered that they were indeed locations of spatial fissures!

One of them was the hidden fissure right beside where he and Yang Kai stood — previously he had been unable to detect it at all and could only infer its outline from the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, but now he could sense it with perfect clarity.

It was as if some special sense of his had been opened.
