## Chapter 522 — Destruction or Baptism?  
  
As if sensing something, Nan Sheng suddenly became fearful and restless, shouting loudly, “Save me, save me!”  
  
He was calling out to Yang Zhao for help.  
  
Yang Zhao heard him, but unfortunately, he did not make any move.  
  
Faced with the overwhelmingly powerful Yang Kai, Yang Zhao had already unleashed every possible method he could muster, but he barely managed to break through some of the Black Flood Dragon’s defenses and couldn’t even touch Yang Kai’s body. How could he find the strength to extend aid to Nan Sheng?  
  
Even if he had the strength, it would be too late for him to react.  
  
In the next moment, it was as if an invisible giant hand clamped down on Nan Sheng’s throat, abruptly cutting off his piercing scream.  
  
Not far from him, Xiang Chu looked on in shock, his eyes trembling violently.  
  
He realized that his eldest brother’s eyes were glazed over, life rapidly draining away.  
  
A brilliant light shot out from Nan Sheng’s head, returning to Yang Kai’s hand and reshaping into that small sword.  
  
Nan Sheng fell back, face upturned, eyes wide open, a deathly expression frozen on his face, his gaze lifeless.  
  
Everyone present was struck with shock.  
  
Apart from a few seasoned Divine Roaming Realm masters, no one had seen when exactly that small sword had launched its attack.  
  
Even those few who glimpsed some clue furrowed their brows with alarm. They did not know if they could withstand such an attack if Yang Kai unleashed this Divine Soul Treasure against them.  
  
A Divine Soul Treasure differs from ordinary secret treasures; it is a secret treasure activated by the Divine Sense, injuring only the spirit and the sea of consciousness.  
  
Its power directly correlates with the strength of the user’s Divine Sense. The stronger the Divine Sense, the greater the effect; the weaker, the less impact it can generate.  
  
Although this small sword was a high-rank Heaven-Grade treasure of considerable quality, without a massive Divine Sense fueling it, it could not manifest its full potential.  
  
Having witnessed such a strike, the two Blood Servants who were fighting Tang Yuxian no longer dared to hesitate; they both retreated to stand guard beside Yang Zhao.  
  
They feared that if Yang Kai’s killing intent flared, he might strike at the Second Young Master—an outcome that would escalate matters drastically.  
  
Tang Yuxian, however, did not pursue. Gasping slightly for breath, she stood alone in front of Yang Kai.  
  
The Black Jiao Dragon coiled, raising its body over a dozen zhang tall, its huge triangular head and slender eyes fixed ominously on Xiang Chu amidst the crowd, its eyes flickering with a cold, sinister light.  
  
With Nan Sheng’s sudden death, Xiang Chu was terrified, his soul almost dislodged. He now understood that Yang Kai indeed possessed the power to kill him even under Yang Zhao’s protection.  
  
Frightened and aghast, he glanced at Yang Kai, wondering if his own death might come next.  
  
Seeking a strong protector, he looked around anxiously, but everyone kept their distance, faces filled with wariness.  
  
Among them were many who once treated Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng as sworn brothers, sharing drinks and laughter, dreaming of the future. Yet now, they avoided Xiang Chu like venomous vipers, afraid that being associated with him would cause them to become targets of Yang Kai and die a senseless death.  
  
Human nature is like drinking water—one knows its warmth or coldness themselves.  
  
Xiang Chu suddenly felt disillusioned and bitter, his expression turning grim and ferocious as he sneered coldly at those who kept their distance.  
  
Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, clutching the little sword tightly. His brows furrowed deeply as his True Yuan fluctuated restlessly, his aura surging.  
  
Boom—  
  
The rumble of thunder came from the sky like a mighty war drum pounding deep within the earth, shaking everyone’s eardrums and making their hearts pound fiercely.  
  
Storm clouds billowed and thickened, covering the entire War City with darkness until not a speck of light could be seen.  
  
In the pitch-black gloom where one could not see their own hand, no one knew what was transpiring. All the surrounding cultivators murmured quietly, gazing anxiously at the gathering clouds, their hearts restless and fearful.  
  
In a certain place, Meng Wuya, who had been standing quietly with his arms folded, suddenly brightened, his eyes blazing as he stared intently at the motionless Yang Kai. A look of anticipation appeared on his face.  
  
“Master, Master!” Xia Ningshang gasped as she suddenly emerged from the residence.  
  
Meng Wuya glanced at her, putting a finger to his lips to hush her.  
  
Xia Ningshang bowed her head slightly and asked in a quiet voice, “Master, Junior Brother, what’s wrong with him?”  
  
“I don’t know. It looks like a Qi Deviation gone awry, but his mind remains clear. This bastard has some changes I couldn’t understand—really frustrating.” Meng Wuya’s face was troubled. Since arriving at War City, he had bailed Yang Kai out more than a few times. Though he always claimed he would not involve himself in the Succession War, when Yang Kai faced difficulties, he was forced to intervene.  
  
“Is Junior Brother alright now?” Xia Ningshang’s beautiful eyes were filled with worry as she asked anxiously.  
  
“He should be.” Meng Wuya slowly shook his head, his expression strange. “Not only is he fine, but it seems like he’s about to breakthrough.”  
  
“A breakthrough!” Xia Ningshang exclaimed, covering her mouth and looking up at the heavy clouds in the sky. Feeling the destructive power embedded in those clouds, her face paled, suddenly realizing, “Master, do you mean this phenomenon is caused by Junior Brother's breakthrough?”  
  
“Most likely.” Meng Wuya was equally shaken.  
  
Never before had any cultivator caused such an uproar when breaking through to the Divine Roaming Realm.  
  
The power of heaven and earth contained within those clouds was beyond the endurance of a Divine Roaming Realm cultivator. Even he himself might not be able to withstand it.  
  
“Can Junior Brother endure such a baptism?” Xia Ningshang panicked.  
  
Whenever a cultivator breaks through a major realm, changes in the world’s spiritual energy occur, facilitating a cleansing baptism to strengthen the body.  
  
The benefits gained from the baptism depend on the cultivator’s aptitude and physical condition.  
  
The better the aptitude, the stronger the body, the greater the benefits.  
  
When Xia Ningshang rose to the Divine Roaming Realm, she underwent this trial, though the spiritual energy she attracted then was less than a tenth of what it was now.  
  
This kind of heavenly power could no longer be called a baptism; it was destruction!  
  
“His fate will decide.” Meng Wuya said gravely, worry briefly clouding his brow. Beyond his precious disciple’s deep affection for that brat, he genuinely didn’t wish for Yang Kai to meet a premature death.  
  
This brat was a rare breed who could break through the world’s limitations and ascend to higher levels.  
  
Meng Wuya was curious to see how far he could grow.  
  
“Why must he breakthrough at such a critical moment?” Xia Ningshang nearly cried. Battles still raged nearby, and Yang Kai undergoing this baptism and breakthrough now could bring disastrous consequences if interrupted.  
  
“Perhaps he gleaned some insight during the fight.” Meng Wuya sighed. Fate is unpredictable. It’s a blessing that Yang Kai broke through at this crucial juncture. The breakthrough is imminent. If he can’t hold it back, there’s no stopping the natural course of things. After a pause, Meng Wuya added, “Don’t worry. When things get truly dangerous, I won’t just stand by.”  
  
“Mm.” Xia Ningshang nodded lightly, staring in that direction.  
  
Although the War City was cloaked in darkness, cultivators of high skill could still perceive some things.  
  
Yang Zhao suddenly snapped awake and looked at Yang Kai with great strangeness. His voice trembled as he asked, “Ninth Brother, you’re not breaking through, are you?”  
  
Yang Kai looked at him, took a deep breath, and nodded solemnly.  
  
Tang Yuxian’s expression shifted, a trace of unease appearing.  
  
Yang Zhao laughed bitterly, clenching his fist and gritting his teeth. “Do you think Second Brother would just let you break through, to let you grow stronger?”  
  
“I don’t think so.” Yang Kai shook his head. “If Second Brother wants to stop me, he may try... but only if you can bear the cost!”  
  
Yang Zhao’s face turned cold, his eyes filled with fear and hesitation. He hadn’t yet resolved whether to start an all-out battle with Yang Kai right here.  
  
With only himself and two Blood Servants, he could no longer stop Yang Kai.  
  
Yang Kai’s current state was already terrifying. If he broke through to the Divine Roaming Realm, he would become even more formidable. At that point, Yang Zhao might never catch up to him.  
  
Now was a perfect opportunity—if he did not seize it, Yang Zhao feared he'd regret it for life.  
  
Boom—  
  
The rumbling thunder sounded again. Yang Kai’s face flickered with pain.  
  
Above his head, the roiling black clouds spun faster and faster, forming a massive whirlpool. From it came an irresistible suction force, pulling Yang Kai’s body upward.  
  
A violent, destructive, ruthless, bloodthirsty, evil aura busted out from within Yang Kai as he ascended, engulfing the entire War City. It felt as though the city had instantly transformed into a Shura’s purgatory.  
  
Among the tens of thousands in the War City, about sixty percent suddenly found their hearts racing as the latent evil within them stirred, affecting their temperaments.  
  
After a moment, Yang Kai stopped several dozen zhang in the air, remaining perfectly still.  
  
The spinning black clouds swirled ever faster.  
  
Suddenly, a black energy bombarded him from the whirlpool above.  
  
With a muffled grunt, Yang Kai’s body seemed like a bottomless abyss, swallowing the destructive energy entirely within just a few breaths.  
  
Yang Zhao changed color violently!  
  
He hadn’t expected Yang Kai to handle it so effortlessly. His hesitant expression solidified considerably.  
  
Xiang Chu’s voice called out, “Second Young Master, seize the chance now or never!”  
  
Nan Sheng had just died before his eyes. Fearing he might share the same fate, watching Yang Kai break through now gave him a glimmer of hope. Naturally, he eagerly awaited Yang Zhao’s order to attack.  
  
If Yang Kai lives, he will die eventually, that man is someone who acts on his words.  
  
Moreover, Yang Kai is currently breaking through and likely has no energy left to deal with him. Seeing this clearly, Xiang Chu cannot help but loudly egg on the attack.
