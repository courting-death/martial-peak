## Chapter 1006 — Pill Refining

In the depths of the forest, Yang Kai and Shen Tu moved like the wind, gathering one precious spiritual herb after another, each of remarkably high grade, and swiftly stowing them away.

The medicinal materials produced here were at least Saint-Grade in quality, and most of them were Saint King-Grade.

Shen Tu's face twisted with excitement.

He had never imagined the resources on this continent could be so abundant; almost every few dozen zhang there stood herbs that had grown for countless years, waiting to be harvested by him and Yang Kai.

The Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine on this continent were dozens of times richer than those on any single medicine star within the Star Domain; their medicinal properties were condensed and aged to perfection, and, most remarkably, they seemed to have been left undisturbed for ages.

The mysterious old man must be a profound cultivator who likely looked down on these materials and had little use for them after collecting them, which is why the Spiritual Herbs and Medicines had ample time to grow.

Shen Tu did not know much about herbs—he normally only swallowed already-refined Pills—yet even he was dazzled by the sheer abundance of material, his excitement barely contained.

Following Yang Kai’s precise guidance, they swept every mature medicinal material along their path clean.

"Hey Yang Kai, come look…" Shen Tu suddenly shouted from the side, his voice trembling slightly, as if he had discovered something extraordinary.

Yang Kai hurried over; he found Shen Tu crouched before a strange orchid that gave off a faint, clarifying fragrance, invigorating the mind and body. Its pristine white petals shimmered with an otherworldly glow—it was truly no ordinary flower.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as he murmured, "Seven-Color Thousand-Knot Orchid?"

The Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine produced on this continent were largely similar to those from Tongxuan Continent, the main difference being the far higher grades here, and there were many herbs whose names even Yang Kai couldn’t recall—plants that simply didn’t exist on Tongxuan Continent.

On Tongxuan Continent, a Seven-Color Thousand-Knot Orchid would at most rank as a Saint-Grade Middle-Level specimen, but now this orchid radiated astonishing energy fluctuations and terrifying medicinal potency that far exceeded the Saint-Grade Middle-Level.

"Yang Kai, what grade is this? It feels... different," Shen Tu cried, his eyes burning as he stared at the orchid.

"According to how the Starry Void classifies a martial artist’s power, this should be an Origin-Grade medicinal material," Yang Kai said in a low voice.

Shen Tu sucked in a breath, his face shifting through several shades of astonishment as he muttered, "Origin-Grade medicinal material here? My heavens—there’s Origin-Grade material here!"

Even across the entire Star Domain, Origin-Grade herbs were exceedingly precious. The fact that they had found one so soon after beginning their search spoke volumes about how incredibly rich in resources this continent was.

Yang Kai carefully harvested the Seven-Color Thousand-Knot Orchid and placed it into his Spatial Pouch, a small thrill stirring in his heart.

The two of them exchanged a look and wordlessly set about searching with renewed vigor.

The floating continent teemed with medicinal materials; the cultivators of Purple Star and the Sword Alliance, stimulated by the provisions, seemed to momentarily forget their awkward situation and frantically scoured the area.

Whether or not they could leave this continent, these materials would have enormous impact on a cultivator’s strength.

Yang Kai and Shen Tu both reaped great harvests. The continent was not small, and with only about a hundred cultivators from Purple Star and the Sword Alliance dispersing in all directions, clashes between them were rare.

They could search to their hearts’ content—and do so safely.

After more than ten days, Yang Kai came to a stop.

"What is it?" Shen Tu, still ebullient and scanning the surroundings with glowing eyes, noticed Yang Kai had halted and called back.

"I’ve collected enough medicinal materials; I’m going to start refining Pills."

"Refining the Pill to remove the seal on you?" Shen Tu asked.

"Yes."

"But you can’t use your power—how will you refine Pills?" Shen Tu asked skeptically.

"I have my methods. You go on and search; there’s a cave over there I was thinking of using as a temporary shelter. You can find me there," Yang Kai said, pointing to a nearby spot where he had earlier noticed a suitable resting place.

"All right," Shen Tu agreed without pressing him, knowing Yang Kai was eager to recover his strength. "Take care. I’ll search a while longer."

With that he strode away carefree.

Yang Kai checked his bearings and headed toward the cave he had seen earlier.

Before long he arrived at the cave entrance, sent his Divine Sense inside to scout, confirmed there was no danger, and then entered.

The cave appeared naturally formed; from the roof hung many aged stalactites, and from their tips dripped rivulets of mountain spring water infused with Spiritual Qi.

Yang Kai caught a few drops and drank them, instantly feeling his mind clear and his spirit refreshed.

The mountain spring water was no ordinary liquid; it contained vast Heaven-and-Earth Energy, almost pure Spiritual Qi condensed into fluid—anyone who took it would gain tremendous benefit. Its effect was comparable to Wan Yao Ling Ye, able to improve constitution and enhance strength.

However, its effect was slightly inferior to Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Yang Kai moved deeper into the cave until he found a dry spot and sat cross-legged.

The cave’s inner chamber was not small—about the size of a few houses. The light was dim, but the environment provided just the right space for Yang Kai to work.

Though his physical strength could not be used, his Divine Sense was not restricted!

Ever since long ago, he never needed his physical strength to refine Pills; using only his Divine Sense Fire he could refine any Pill he desired, and it was faster and more convenient than using Saint Yuan.

He had not refined Pills for some time, so Yang Kai first took out some Saint-Grade medicinal materials to craft a few Saint Pills and reacquaint himself with the process.

He brought out the small alchemical furnace and set it before him.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense wrapped the herbs, and the Divine Sense Fire erupted to condense the medicinal liquid.

In a short time several Saint-Grade ingredients were purified, leaving behind a rich, potent medicinal tincture.

He etched various spirit formations used for alchemy into the furnace, poured in the medicinal liquid, and controlled the fire’s temperament.

Yang Kai was practiced and at ease.

Even though he had not refined Pills for a long time, the entire process had become instinctive.

Not a single detail went wrong; his precision was impeccable.

Gradually the cave filled with the fragrance of Pills.

When the aroma reached the proper intensity, Yang Kai reined in the Divine Sense Fire, waited a moment, and flicked the furnace with his fingers.

A round, plump Pill shot out and landed between his fingers.

It bore no Pill Patterns—somewhat disappointing—but it was a genuine Saint-Grade Middle-Level Pill.

Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction and casually placed the Pill into the Demon God's Secret Codex before closing his eyes to recover.

Although refining a Saint Pill did not consume a large amount of Divine Sense, it still required a fair expenditure, and Yang Kai could not squander his Divine Sense recklessly. He therefore had to remain constantly at his peak.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, he resumed refining.

Back on Tongxuan Continent he had been able to refine Saint-Grade Upper-Level Pills; the Nine Heavens Sacred Land at that time had gathered abundant materials and wealth, allowing him to elevate his alchemical skill at will.

But Saint-Grade Upper-Level Pills would likely be insufficient to break the seal Lü Guichen had placed on him.

Lü Guichen was an expert at the Saint King Realm; only Saint King-Grade Pills could pierce his methods.

Therefore, the urgent matter was to use his available resources to further improve his alchemy technique.

When he left Tongxuan Continent he brought a large quantity of supplies, and on this continent he and Shen Tu had gathered even more Saint King-Grade and Origin-Grade medicinal materials.

He need not worry about materials at all.

Time passed as Yang Kai immersed himself in alchemy, living alone in the cave amid rising Pill fragrance. Outside, the floating continent was bustling—those from Purple Star and the Sword Alliance made great harvests and were elated each day.

Yet Lü Guichen was somewhat displeased.

Because they lacked a Storage Secret Treasure!

Without a Storage Secret Treasure, even if they gathered medicinal materials there was nowhere to store them. That was the lesser problem; the gravest issue was that the medicinal potency of collected materials decayed with every passing moment.

The daily diminishing potency of the Saint King-Grade and Origin-Grade materials pained Lü Guichen almost to the point of bleeding; he felt worse with each passing day.

He wished he could find that mysterious old man and seize back the Spatial Ring that belonged to him.

But he only dared to think it—facing that old man, Lü Guichen could not summon a single thought of resistance.

……

On a certain peak the mysterious old man wore a tense expression as he carefully arranged something across a wide flat area; many high-grade Saint Crystals had been placed there in rows and columns, forming a large formation.

At the exact center of the formation stood a gate-like object, erect upon the flat ground.

That transparent-through-and-through gate had been forged using the warship fragments he had picked up earlier.

The two shattered warships had been of Saint King Upper-Level quality, and the materials of their hulls were likewise top-grade—just right for the old man to forge this door.

This continent lacked rare minerals, so he had long been unable to find suitable materials to craft that crucial gate.

Heaven knew how excited he had been when those warship fragments fell from the sky and landed upon this continent!

The gate’s frame and base were also inlaid with superb Saint Crystals, making it look exquisitely beautiful.

A strange energy fluctuation slowly flowed from within the gate; even someone as formidable as the mysterious old man dared not approach it casually, as if some great danger lay hidden beyond.

The old man’s expression turned fierce and mad as he walked about arranging things, muttering, "Soon, soon, nearly there!"

A terrifying light bloomed in his eyes that sent chills down the spine.

After arranging for a while he halted and let his Divine Sense ripple outward, covering the entire continent in the blink of an eye.

The movements of everyone active on the continent were laid bare in his mind.

He grinned strangely. “Heh heh, lively bunch, aren’t you? Good, good—vitality is a fine thing. This old man can’t stand lifelessness; I’ve been alone for two thousand years and can’t bear that torment any longer. If you lot were dull and spiritless, that would truly give me a headache… Huh, that youngster is interesting."
