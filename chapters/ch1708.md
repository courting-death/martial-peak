## Chapter 1708 — Can He Bear It?

"So many? All for me?" Sha Hu stared with wide eyes at the jade bottles laid out before him and asked in astonishment.

"Mm." Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

"Didn’t we agree to split it fifty‑fifty? These…"

“This is an even split — fifty-fifty!”

Sha Hu was stunned, his face filled with incredulity.

Over the past days he had provided Yang Kai with a little over one hundred silver lotuses; that had been almost all of his stock.

He had thought that harvesting two hundred Huntian Pills would already be very good, but the jade bottles piled in front of him showed that reality had far exceeded his expectations.

There were at least sixty to seventy jade bottles here, and each bottle contained ten pills, which meant Yang Kai had given him six to seven hundred Huntian Pills!

How had he refined so many Huntian Pills? As the former island master of Ghost Isle, Sha Hu had seen many incompetent pill refiners at work—when a Huntian Lotus reached those alchemists, managing to produce two or three pills was already excellent; there was no way they could match Yang Kai’s yield.

This could only indicate indirectly that Yang Kai’s pill‑refining skill was countless times superior to those poor alchemists!

“Boy Yang, you’ve made a friend of this old man!” Sha Hu composed himself and looked solemnly at Yang Kai. “If the day ever comes that we escape this place, I promise you — the gates of Sea Hall will forever stand open to you.”

Yang Kai’s straightforwardness and his habit of keeping promises moved Sha Hu. Sha Hu had personally verified Yang Kai’s strength; such a person was worthy of lowering his pride to befriend, so his words were sincere.

Yang Kai chuckled, calm and unflustered. "Since Elder Sha Hu says that, I won’t refuse the courtesy."

Gaining such an ally on Ghost Isle was naturally what Yang Kai wanted; it was better than wandering here alone. Besides, Sha Hu was the island’s previous master and knew Ghost Isle well—going forward, having him as a comrade would be beneficial.

Sha Hu laughed heartily. "Pity there’s no fine wine here, otherwise it would be a grand pleasure to drink with you! Never mind, I’ll first see whether these Huntian Pills are of use to me!"

He had not taken Huntian Pills for nearly one hundred years. His strength had stagnated, which vexed him; now that he had so many Huntian Pills, he could not wait to test them.

He casually took out a jade bottle and poured out a Spiritual Pill without hesitation, then popped it into his mouth in front of Yang Kai.

The next moment Sha Hu’s body trembled, an expression of disbelief appearing on his face as he cried out, "Origin‑Grade pill? Yang Kai, you’re actually an Origin‑Grade alchemist?"

This time he was truly shocked.

Earlier, when Yang Kai had said he was a pill refiner and could make Huntian Pills, he had not paid it much mind and had only assumed Yang Kai had some skill in alchemy. But once the Huntian Pill entered his mouth, he sensed something was different.

The Huntian Pill Yang Kai had refined was completely unlike any he had taken before; the greatest difference was the pill’s rank!

Sha Hu instantly judged that this Huntian Pill was an Origin‑Grade pill, and at least Origin‑Grade Middle‑Level—perhaps even Upper‑Level!

That meant Yang Kai was absolutely an alchemist above Origin‑Grade!

He didn’t dare imagine Yang Kai as a Void King-Grade Alchemist — that was nothing more than a legend.

The Spiritual Pill melted on the tongue into a warm current that flowed into the lower abdomen, then surged from the Dantian throughout the limbs and bones.

Sha Hu’s old face flushed instantly; it was a clear sign that his Qi and blood had grown stronger. His muscles bulged and blue veins snaked under his skin.

He no longer had time to talk to Yang Kai and hurried to absorb the pill’s medicinal power with all his heart.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and did not disturb him; instead he left the hut and found a quiet spot on the islet to take a Huntian Pill himself.

The Huntian Pills he had refined were entirely different from those obtained from the two corpses earlier.

The Huntian Pills obtained before had been imperfectly refined and their efficacy failed to manifest—they were defective products. On Ghost Isle such things were unavoidable; the alchemists’ low skill, the inability to use Saint Yuan, the quality of the earthfire—various reasons caused Ghost Isle’s alchemists to produce shoddy Huntian Pills and waste many Huntian Lotuses.

Yang Kai had plugged all those shortcomings, so it was no wonder the Spiritual Pills he produced were excellent.

Through his experiments over the days he had concluded that Huntian Pills refined from silver lotuses were Origin‑Grade, those from green lotuses were Saint King‑Grade, and those from pink Huntian Lotuses were Saint‑Grade—each rank’s Huntian Pill produced effects worlds apart.

He had not used golden lotuses because there were too few—he only had about ten.

But he felt that if golden lotuses were used, the resulting Huntian Pills should be Void King‑Grade.

The medicinal force surged and flowed through the meridians and flesh, transforming the body, the meridians, and cells within, making Yang Kai’s physical body increasingly robust.

This was the first time he had taken a Huntian Pill, and the benefits were almost unimaginable.

Moreover, because he had previously taken a great deal of Life Jade Nectar, his body had already approached perfection, so he could absorb the Huntian Pill’s power more quickly and effectively.

In less than half an hour a single Origin‑Grade Huntian Pill’s effects had been fully absorbed by Yang Kai.

He did not delay; he took out another pill, tossed it into his mouth, and continued absorbing it.

When one could not cultivate Saint Yuan or Divine Sense, taking Huntian Pills to train one’s physical strength was the only path for Ghost Isle’s warriors.

Three days later, a burst of laughter suddenly rang from the hut. A little dolphin swimming in the islet’s lake glanced up, then lazily buried its head beneath a lotus leaf and stopped paying attention.

A figure shot up from the hut and soon ran swiftly toward where Yang Kai was.

Shortly, Sha Hu stood before Yang Kai, his eyes bright and his entire aura seemingly changed—he had become noticeably stronger.

Yang Kai opened his eyes, glanced at Sha Hu, and smiled: "Elder Sha Hu seems to have broken through."

Sha Hu looked at Yang Kai with gratitude, nodding. "Indeed. After a hundred years of stagnation I finally rose one level, and I feel there is still room to improve. Boy Yang, I have noted this favor."

"Elder Sha Hu need not be so polite," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

“Yang Kai, how about taking a punch from this old man?” Sha Hu asked with a grin. In this damned place, he had no one to spar with — so he could only set his sights on Yang Kai.

"All right." To his surprise, Yang Kai agreed without hesitation.

Sha Hu did not hesitate. He roared, shoved off the ground with both feet, and shot forward like an arrow from a bow; mid‑air he threw a punch.

Yang Kai sat cross‑legged, motionless, smiling as he looked at him as if he gave no regard to that earth‑shattering strike.

Sha Hu was astonished and angrily shouted, "Boy Yang, you don’t take me seriously at all, do you?"

"Elder Sha Hu, use your full strength," Yang Kai replied calmly.

Sha Hu’s old face could not bear the slight loss of dignity; although grateful, being treated so lightly left a prickly feeling. Hearing Yang Kai’s words, he steeled himself and truly used his full power.

The sound of air shattering was heard as Sha Hu’s fist fell like a falling star, carrying a world‑ending might.

If that punch landed, even a mountain a hundred zhang high would be pulverized.

Yang Kai merely extended his palm to block, utterly composed.

The next moment their fist and palm met.

Yang Kai’s body only trembled slightly and he remained seated, unmoving.

Sha Hu was thrown back three steps by a huge recoil. A flush crossed his face and then disappeared.

His expression changed; the earlier resentment vanished and was replaced by the kind of look one would give a monster as he stared at Yang Kai in silence for a long while.

When they had battled a few days earlier he had been slightly at a disadvantage, but had never been completely suppressed like this; now, even after his own strength increased and he gave his all, he still could not budge Yang Kai’s body.

Only one conclusion could be drawn—while his own strength had grown, Yang Kai’s had grown even faster; otherwise such an outcome would be impossible.

"How many Huntian Pills did you take?" Sha Hu asked after a long pause, grappling for the key question.

"A little over one hundred." Yang Kai thought for a moment and answered.

Sha Hu sucked in a cold breath, his eyelids twitching as he exclaimed in alarm, "Your body—can it bear that?"

Over the past three days, he had only taken about ten Huntian Pills. The Huntian Pills refined by Yang Kai were far from comparable to those produced on Ghost Isle — they were genuine Origin-Grade pills. Taking too many in a short time was beyond what even the strongest body could endure; the unrefined medicinal power would damage flesh and meridians, and in the worst case, cause the body to explode and die.

Three days and ten pills was already Sha Hu’s limit, yet Yang Kai had taken ten times that amount!

“What’s there that can’t be endured?” Yang Kai asked in puzzlement.

He had not mentioned that many of the Huntian Pills he took had developed Pill Patterns, and a single Huntian Pill with a pattern counted for the efficacy of two pills.

Sha Hu stood stupefied, shaking his head again and again and saying in a forlorn tone, "A monster—truly a monster!"

He was certain he was no match for Yang Kai now. If a few days ago he had still had some hope of escaping from Yang Kai, he no longer had absolute confidence.

It was easy to imagine that as time went on, the gap between their strengths would only widen.

A truly excellent body‑refining technique was wondrous indeed, Sha Hu thought to himself.

He did not know that Yang Kai’s ability to absorb the power of a hundred Huntian Pills in a short time was not only due to training in a body‑refining technique but also because of the solid foundation laid by previously taking much Life Jade Nectar.

That was a condition Sha Hu could not possess.

An Origin‑Grade alchemist was already a monstrous existence, and on top of that such a person had helped him—if Sha Hu did not seek friendship with him he would truly be a fool.

He quietly resolved that whether or not they ever escaped Ghost Isle, he would be Yang Kai's most loyal ally!
