## Chapter 1474 — Willing or Unwilling

Seeing Yang Kai and Huang Juan asking each other questions, appearing quite familiar, the shopkeeper could not help but show a trace of impatience; he instinctively assumed someone acquainted with a destitute person like Huang Juan could not be a wealthy fellow.

Moreover, Yang Kai had just come out of the Imperial Garden, had endured several fierce battles, and had flown from the Outer Sea all the way to Haicheng City, dusty and weary — he truly did not look like much.

His face darkened; his previous ingratiating and flattering manner vanished. He said in a low voice, "If the two of you wish to reminisce, could you please not stand here and interfere with this little shop's business? Find somewhere else to talk; you may chat as long as you like."

Hearing that, Yang Kai glanced at him carelessly, recognizing the man's condescending attitude, and felt some irritation. He snorted coldly and asked, "How many Saint Crystals for one Spiritual Pill?"

"What? You want to buy?" The shopkeeper surnamed Cheng sized Yang Kai up and down, his face showing suspicion.

"What? Can't I buy?"

"Of course you can, but this is a small shop — cash for goods..."

As Cheng's words fell, a cloth pouch flew over. He hurried to catch it, probed inside with his Divine Sense, and his expression instantly performed a complete about-face. He beamed and said, "Excellent — guest, please wait a moment."

Saying that, he quickly took out a Spiritual Pill and handed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took the Spiritual Pill and had no intention of quarreling further. The other man was only a cultivator who had entered the Saint Realm; although his conduct was questionable, Yang Kai would not stoop to argue with him. He simply instructed Huang Juan, "Come with me."

"Oh." Huang Juan answered dazedly, her heart fluttering as she followed closely behind Yang Kai.

Not long after, under Yang Kai's lead, the two entered an inn and rented a side room. Yang Kai handed the Spiritual Pill to Huang Juan and told her to sit and recuperate.

After the span of a night, Huang Juan had recovered to her former state.

The Spiritual Pill was not a top-tier elixir — only Saint King-Grade Lower-Level in potency — but as an antidote its efficacy was respectable. The poison she had been suffering from was not particularly strong, only long-lasting; once the Spiritual Pill entered her and she took time to meditate, the medicine took effect and she was entirely cured, with no further worries.

When she opened her eyes again, the woman looked at Yang Kai with a somewhat complicated expression and said gratefully, “This humble woman thanks Sect Master Yang for your timely aid. This grace, I shall never forget for as long as I live.”

Her voice choked with emotion. Had she not by chance encountered Yang Kai, who knew what fate might have befallen her. It was unlikely she would have perished outright, but having been long tormented by that toxin would certainly have harmed her strength, perhaps even caused a fall in realm — an outcome no warrior could accept.

"It's nothing," Yang Kai said lightly, waving his hand. "But it seems Guest Elder Huang has not been living well these past years."

Hearing that, Huang Juan brushed back a stray lock of hair and gave a bitter smile. "Not just 'not well' — it's been extremely arduous."

After leaving the Haike Family, she discovered how difficult it was to cultivate alone in this world. At first she had not noticed much; after all, she had served as a Guest Elder in the Haike Family for many years and had saved a little.

But when those savings ran out, the nightmare began.

With no backing and no background, for everything she had to rely on herself. Being a woman and still somewhat attractive, she often drew the lecherous gaze of unscrupulous men and several times faced perilous situations.

She had wanted to join a sect or a family, but cultivators of unknown origin like her were seldom welcomed.

Reluctantly, she had to search Haicheng City for others like herself and join groups to hunt sea beasts in the Outer Sea for a living. But such work carried enormous risk — she had witnessed many cultivators meet tragic ends in the Outer Sea, and the teams she traveled with changed time and again. Luckily, she had often escaped death by a hair.

Until the time she encountered a sea beast and was poisoned; thereafter no one would travel with her. To rid herself of the toxin she sold off all her belongings, but still could not afford the Saint Crystals needed for a single Spiritual Pill. She had been to that shop many times, begging each time, yet the Cheng shopkeeper refused to grant her any convenience.

Until today, when she met Yang Kai.

After listening to her tale, Yang Kai nodded lightly, pondered for a moment, and suddenly asked, "Have you considered going back?"

"Going back?" Huang Juan's expression froze; a trace of longing crossed her face, but she shook her head bitterly. "I cannot go back. I have already left the Haike Family — how could I face them? Besides, I heard the family dismissed all outside Guest Elders years ago, keeping only a few of their own elders. Even if I returned, they would not accept me."

"No, no — I don't mean back to the Haike Family. I mean go find Wu Yi, go find Chang Qi and Hao An!" Yang Kai raised a finger and waved it.

"You mean... go to Lingxiao Sect?" Huang Juan's eyes brightened.

"Oh? You know Lingxiao Sect?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Sect Master Yang speaks lightly," Huang Juan said, her bright eyes shifting. "Lingxiao Sect's reputation is at its peak now. Though I have long resided in Haicheng City, how could I not have heard of it? Moreover, news of the battle at Dragon Lair Mountain has spread across Dark Star — now there are likely few who do not know the name of Lingxiao Sect and of Sect Master Yang."

"I'm that famous?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. He did not think Huang Juan was flattering him; after all, this place is adjacent to the Outer Sea and far from the interior, yet she had heard of the Dragon Lair Mountain battle and Lingxiao Sect, so her words were probably true.

"Enough of that — leave it be. I'm asking about the proposal I mentioned earlier; what do you think?"

Excitement flickered across Huang Juan's face, but she did not answer immediately. After hesitating for a long while, she said sadly, "I would like to, of course, but my cultivation is so meager — how could I possibly be accepted into Lingxiao Sect?"

"Low cultivation? So what? There are many within the sect weaker than you. You know the Haike Family disciples' abilities — most remain at the Saint Realm level; some have advanced to the Saint King Realm, but many are still far inferior to you," Yang Kai said with a wry smile.

"But..."

“No ‘buts.’ Whether you’re willing or not—it’s just a matter of saying the word.” Yang Kai’s expression turned stern as he cut her off.

Huang Juan bit her lip and, after a long moment, solemnly nodded, "I am willing!"

"Then that's settled." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "From today on, you are of Lingxiao Sect."

As Sect Master, taking someone in was hardly a matter.

"Your subordinate thanks Sect Master for taking me in!" Huang Juan was decisive — otherwise she would not have left the Haike Family years ago and gone into exile. Having made her decision, she did not hesitate and promptly prostrated herself.

"No need for such ceremony." Yang Kai helped her up. Observing her, he saw she still harbored doubts and proactively explained, "Meeting you here is fate. Besides, Wu Yi, Chang Qi and Hao An have often spoken of you, and the sect is currently urgently short of Origin Returning Realm experts to garrison, which is why I arranged this. Don't overthink it."

"Yes!" Huang Juan nodded slightly. "But Sect Master, I'm currently only Third Stage of the Saint King Realm."

She thought Yang Kai had made a mistake.

"Now you're Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; in time you'll reach the Origin Returning Realm," Yang Kai grinned with confidence. Huang Juan's situation was like Chang Qi and Hao An — both had been stuck at this realm for years without breaking through, but since they managed to succeed, Huang Juan should be able to as well.

The Lingxiao Sect’s name was indeed resounding now, and with its foundation established within the Flowing Flame Sandland, there was no need to worry about outsiders causing trouble. However, the true strength of a sect lay in the number and power of its experts—it could not grow strong by closing its doors and standing still.

Looking over the entire Lingxiao Sect, aside from Ye Xijun and himself, the cultivation of others was pitiable; the number of Origin Returning Realm practitioners was far too few.

Waiting for Wu Yi and the others to mature would take at least ten to twenty years, but Huang Juan was different — she was only one step from breakthrough, essentially a ready Origin Returning Realm candidate, and her background was known.

That was why Yang Kai had the idea to bring her back.

If she had been a stranger of unknown origin, Yang Kai would not have acted so.

Lingxiao Sect would undoubtedly face many setbacks and hardships in the future, so it was only natural to prepare early and think of ways to strengthen itself.

"Is there anything you need to collect here? If not, then come with me," Yang Kai asked, watching her.

"I have nothing to take, but..."

"But what?" Yang Kai looked at her in astonishment.

"There's one more person I want to bring. I beg Sect Master to permit it!"

"Bring someone?" Yang Kai's brow knit. "Who is it?"

He was willing to accept Huang Juan into Lingxiao Sect, but that did not mean he was prepared to take others in as well. Hearing her request, his displeasure showed.

Did this woman have greedy intentions?

Huang Juan could not help showing panic. She lowered her head and said, "Sect Master, please don't be angry. May I ask Sect Master to come with me to meet that person? Decide after you've seen them."

Yang Kai scrutinized her for a moment, then nodded, "All right. Lead the way."

"Thank you, Sect Master." Huang Juan was overjoyed and hurried ahead.

In a remote corner of Haicheng City stood a small, shabby house—such dwellings were common here, low and cramped to the extreme, the very picture of a humble abode. Huang Juan led Yang Kai all the way to this place, lightly knocking on the door in what seemed to be a coded signal before gently pushing it open and stepping inside.

Yang Kai followed in and, turning his head to look, could not help but sigh.

The interior was not only extremely cramped but also dark and damp, the furnishings the barest minimum; apart from the essential pieces there was nothing else.

"You've been living here all these years?" Yang Kai frowned; the anger he had felt earlier dispersed considerably.

"Sect Master, I have only been living here for the past three years," Huang Juan said with an embarrassed smile. As a former Guest Elder of the Haike Family she had once possessed a far more comfortable residence — the present environment was a thousand times worse.
