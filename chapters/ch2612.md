## Chapter 2612 — Another Instant Kill

Just as Yang Kai and Luan Feng were secretly communicating, Wu Yuanzheng had already soared into the air, swooping down like a hunting falcon. His momentum was fierce, and while still midair, he struck out with his palm, shouting, “Kneel before me!”

Hua Feichen was dead, Yin Lesheng was dead, even Elder Zhong was dead…

The Netherworld Sect had now suffered devastating losses.

Wu Yuanzheng intended to make an example of Yang Kai and the others, wanting the world to know the tragic fate that awaited those who killed members of the Netherworld Sect.

As his palm descended, the might of a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert surged forth as if it were tangible, even solidifying the very space itself. It was as if a mountain, not a man, was falling from the sky.

The many disciples of the Netherworld Sect looked on with excitement, eager to witness Yang Kai and the others kneeling and begging for mercy.

Dozens of disciples from Qi Family Stronghold also watched with complicated expressions, especially Qi Hai, who couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. He knew Yang Kai was doomed this time. Once Yang Kai died, regardless of whether the True Phoenix Fire was still with him, he would have no hope of borrowing its power.

His wife’s Heavenly Frost Earth Drizzle poison would likely never be cured. For a moment, his heart was filled with bitterness, and he secretly hated his own weakness and uselessness.

Under the watchful eyes of all, Wu Yuanzheng wore a cold, mocking smile, while Yang Kai and the other two stood rooted to the spot as if scared witless, not daring to move.

Just as the palm was about to strike, Luan Feng suddenly raised her hand and pointed upward, her movement casual, as if flicking away a flying insect.

Yet the power of that finger made Wu Yuanzheng’s face change dramatically.

The overwhelming aura of his Third Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation was instantly shattered by that single finger, his fierce momentum deflating like a punctured ball, dissipating in an instant.

Not only that, but a terrifying force shot forth from ahead, like an indestructible sword, tearing through the Law Power and Emperor Yuan surrounding his body, and ruthlessly piercing his palm.

“Impossible!” Wu Yuanzheng’s heart trembled in shock, his eyes wide with disbelief. He desperately poured all his strength into his palm, trying to resist the invading force.

But the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation he had always prided himself on was now a joke before this mysterious power, utterly useless.

“Pfft…”

A soft sound rang out, blood splattered everywhere, and the ferociously diving Wu Yuanzheng was struck as if by lightning. A hole as thick as a chopstick appeared in his palm, and he tumbled through the air before landing unsteadily, his eyes trembling violently as he stared at Luan Feng.

The disciples of the Netherworld Sect were all stunned.

The disciples of Qi Family Stronghold were equally dumbfounded.

What had they just witnessed?

Wu Yuanzheng, a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert, had his palm pierced by a single finger from a woman, and it seemed he had no power to resist at all.

Everyone was stunned. The entire place fell so silent that you could hear a pin drop, broken only by the pounding of countless hearts.

In this world, who could so casually injure a Third Stage Emperor like this?

“You… who are you?” Wu Yuanzheng’s face was deathly pale. It wasn’t that his injury was so severe—the finger had only pierced his palm, a minor wound that would heal after taking some pills and resting for a while. What shocked him more was the identity of the woman before him.

He was utterly shaken by the woman before him! For her to injure him so effortlessly, she could not possibly be anyone ordinary.

Suddenly, a terrifying thought flashed through his mind, and cold sweat broke out on his forehead. Wu Yuanzheng stammered, “Are you Lady Flower Shadow?”

The moment he spoke, the whole place erupted.

Flower Shadow was a name—and a title!

One of the Ten Great Emperors, the Flower Shadow Great Emperor.

She was also the only female among the Ten Great Emperors. Though a woman, her strength was in no way inferior to the others. She had carved out a place for all female cultivators in the Star Realm and was revered by them all.

Unlike the Great Emperor Youhun, who founded a sect, or the Radiant Moon Great Emperor, Flower Shadow Great Emperor seemed to reside in a place called Myriad Flower Valley. But no one knew exactly where in the Star Realm this valley was located.

The Ten Great Emperors each had their own personalities. Some founded sects and spread their legacies, some wandered the world alone, and some lived in seclusion, unknown to all.

Yet the names of each and every one of them were known throughout the Star Realm.

Wu Yuanzheng’s guess that Luan Feng was the Flower Shadow Great Emperor was not without reason. This woman’s strength far surpassed his own. He was already a Third Stage Emperor, so anyone stronger than him could only be at the level of a Great Emperor.

And since Luan Feng was a woman, it was easy to associate her with Flower Shadow.

“Flower Shadow Great Emperor!”

Exclamations of shock rang out. The dozen or so disciples of the Netherworld Sect all turned pale, their legs trembling, looking as if their parents had just died. It was over. The Vice Sect Master had provoked the wrong person—he had provoked a Great Emperor! And just now, he had even brazenly demanded she kneel…

As for themselves, it was even worse. They had just hurled insults at this great figure.

How could they possibly survive now?

The people from Qi Family Stronghold looked equally grave. Though they had remained silent, they had been mixed up with the Netherworld Sect. Who knew if this Lady Flower Shadow would hold them accountable as well?

On the other side, Wu Yuanzheng was drenched in cold sweat, his face full of terror. He trembled as he said, “My lady, I was blind and failed to recognize your esteemed presence. Please forgive me…”

Having provoked a Great Emperor, Wu Yuanzheng was utterly hopeless. What he couldn’t understand was why someone like Yang Kai, a mere First Stage Emperor, would have a Second Stage female expert by his side, and even a Great Emperor-level powerhouse following him?

Just who was this man, really? What infuriated Wu Yuanzheng even more was how, despite his earlier arrogance, Yang Kai hadn’t corrected him—clearly content to watch the spectacle unfold. Such a scheming heart was truly unforgivable.

“I am not Flower Shadow. You’ve mistaken me for someone else,” Luan Feng said calmly.

“Not Lady Flower Shadow…” Wu Yuanzheng was stunned, staring blankly at Luan Feng. He seemed to recall something and suddenly cried out, “Then you are… you are…”

But Luan Feng had no intention of letting him finish. She pointed at Wu Yuanzheng again, but this time, unlike before, a jet-black flame shot out from her fingertip.

“World-Ending Black Flame. You really are…” Wu Yuanzheng’s face changed dramatically, clearly realizing Luan Feng’s true identity. It was no surprise—after all, this was the outskirts of the Ancient Land, and within it dwelled a female Divine Spirit.

Now, seeing that signature World-Ending Black Flame, how could he not know who she really was?

Divine Spirit Luan Feng!

Wu Yuanzheng was utterly terrified. If he had provoked Flower Shadow Great Emperor, he might still have had a sliver of hope, for it was said that as the only female Great Emperor, Flower Shadow had a gentle temperament and would not make things difficult for others unless they had committed truly heinous acts.

But provoking Divine Spirit Luan Feng was a different matter. Though she was not a wanton killer, she was by no means soft-hearted.

“Spare me, my lady!” Wu Yuanzheng screamed desperately, simultaneously urging his Emperor Yuan to resist the oncoming World-Ending Black Flame.

Luan Feng remained unmoved.

With a crash…

The moment the black flame touched Wu Yuanzheng, it ignited all his Emperor Yuan, turning him instantly into a burning ball of black fire.

His agonized screams were so piercing that everyone who heard them felt their hearts skip a beat.

“Spare me, my lady, spare me…” Wu Yuanzheng frantically tried to suppress the black fire with his Emperor Yuan, but the more power he used, the fiercer the flames burned, as if his Emperor Yuan had become fuel.

His screams and pleas were quickly silenced. Under the all-consuming World-Ending Black Flame, Wu Yuanzheng lasted less than three breaths before being reduced to ashes. Even his Spatial Ring was completely melted.

Deathly silence!

Earlier, Elder Zhong had attacked Yang Kai, only to be instantly killed by a cold, sword-wielding woman.

Now, Wu Yuanzheng had attacked Yang Kai, only to be instantly killed by another woman.

If not for witnessing it themselves, no one would have believed such things could happen in this world.

“Lady Feng, your fire is truly something else,” Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh with regret as he watched Wu Yuanzheng’s Spatial Ring melt away in the flames.

Wu Yuanzheng was, after all, the Vice Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect. There must have been many good things in that ring, but now Luan Feng had burned it all to nothing. How could he not feel heartache?

Luan Feng smiled and said, “It was my oversight, but please, Sir Yang, forgive me this time for the sake of all the treasures you gained last time.”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. With Luan Feng saying this much, what else could he say?

“Spare us, my lady, spare us!”

Suddenly, more than a dozen disciples of the Netherworld Sect all fell to their knees, loudly begging for mercy.

Now that Elder Zhong and Wu Yuanzheng were dead, they had lost their protectors. If they wanted to survive, they could only abandon their pride and dignity.

For a while, the group kept kneeling and kowtowing, their pleas for mercy rising and falling without end.

“Shut up! If you keep making noise, I’ll kill you all!” Ji Yao shouted coldly, her face frosty.

The noise was giving her a headache.

The group immediately fell silent, each one nervously glancing at Luan Feng, afraid she would send them to join the Vice Sect Master in death.

Thud…

Another person knelt down.

Yang Kai glanced over and saw that it was actually Qi Hai.

Qi Hai’s face was ashen as he said miserably, “Brother Yang, this time it was my fault. I only hope that after you kill me, you’ll spare the disciples of the Qi Family Stronghold!”

“Young Stronghold Master!” the disciples of Qi Family Stronghold cried out in alarm.

“Hmph!” Yang Kai glanced at him but ignored him, instead looking off into the distance and saying coldly, “Netherworld Sect… it seems I’ll have to pay them a visit.”

Luan Feng frowned and asked, “Sir Yang, are you going to settle accounts with the Netherworld Sect?”

Yang Kai nodded, “Whether or not there’s a reckoning depends on their attitude. But I have another matter to discuss with them as well.” With that, he turned to Luan Feng and said, “Lady Feng, I’ll trouble you to accompany me.”
