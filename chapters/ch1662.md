## Chapter 1662 — All-Out Invasion

When one’s strength reaches the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, a peculiar thing called the Void Mind Crystal will condense within the body; the Void Mind Crystal contains a peak Void King Realm expert’s lifetime of experience and the distilled essence of the Martial Dao, and even if the cultivator dies the Void Mind Crystal will not vanish.

The founding ancestor of Ice Heart Valley left the Profound Frost Divine Sword at the bottom of the Fateful Cold Pool, yet there was no Void Mind Crystal—this alone reveals much.

She might truly not be dead!

Only, even if that is so, she has not appeared for twenty to thirty thousand years; where the current Ancestor Bing Yun is now—alive or dead—no one knows.

But to Luo Li this was undoubtedly exhilarating news.

Luo Li turned to look at Yang Kai and sighed faintly.

She realized that if Yang Kai were a disciple of Ice Heart Valley, he would assuredly be a talisman of fortune!

Since his arrival at Ice Heart Valley, countless joyous events had occurred. First, Chi Huo was slain; then, her own injuries were healed; and now, the Profound Frost Divine Sword had reappeared in the world. Moreover, what Su Yan had seen and heard indirectly confirmed that the founding ancestor might still be alive somewhere in this world…

This whole string of events was excellent news for Ice Heart Valley.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai is a man and therefore cannot possibly join Ice Heart Valley, and moreover he appeared to hold little goodwill toward them.

“Senior, it’s time to pay Fire Radiance Sect a visit,” Yang Kai said suddenly.

“Mm.” Luo Li nodded at his words. “Indeed, it’s time.”

She gazed into the distance, her expression deep.

From now on, Chi Lan Star will be dominated by Ice Heart Valley!

...

A squadron of five jet-black warships set out from Icebound Island; aboard them were roughly three thousand Ice Heart Valley elites. Led by a single flagship, they set off for the location of the Fire Radiance Mountain Range.

As one of the foremost great sects on Chi Lan Star, Ice Heart Valley naturally possessed its own warships.

However, Yang Kai discovered that even the finest among these warships was only of Upper-Level Origin-Grade quality, serving as the main vessel, while the other four warships were merely of Middle-Level Origin-Grade.

Their quality was in no way comparable to the vessel he possessed.

It seemed that Void King-Grade warships were exceedingly rare throughout the Star Domain.

As instruments for besieging cities and toppling strongholds, this expedition to the Fire Radiance Mountain Range aimed to annihilate the entire Fire Radiance Sect, and Luo Li naturally intended to deploy warships—these mighty war fortresses.

Ice Heart Valley’s disciples all knew their purpose; each bore a grave expression, a fierce determination hidden within their brows.

Countless years of conflict had deepened the hatred between Ice Heart Valley and Fire Radiance Sect beyond reconciliation; many of their Senior Sisters had been cruelly slain by Fire Radiance Sect cultivators, and because they were women, once captured by Fire Radiance Sect cultivators their fates were often more miserable than death.

When they learned the Great Elder would personally lead the assault on Fire Radiance Sect, the three thousand elites all volunteered willingly—eager to join the fight, burning with anger as they awaited the moment to erupt in the Fire Radiance Mountain Range and reduce their ten-thousand-year-old foes to ash.

The fleet moved swiftly; although Ice Heart Valley lay ten million li from Fire Radiance Sect, in only a few days the five warships had already reached the outskirts of the Fire Radiance Mountain Range.

On the flagship, Luo Li stood upon the deck, her gaze toward the distance; behind her stood Ice Heart Valley’s cadre of high elders.

Yang Kai and Su Yan were mixed among the crowd.

“This is the Fire Radiance Mountain Range?” Yang Kai looked ahead, clicking his tongue in wonder.

As far as the eye could see the mountains rose and fell; the vast range lay like a dragon crawling on the earth, stretching for countless tens of thousands of li, peaks overlapping with no end in sight.

Moreover, the entire mountain range seemed suffused with an extraordinarily dense fire-type Spiritual Qi; to the naked eye red light faintly flashed between the ranges.

Even the temperature of heaven and earth had risen considerably.

“That’s right, this is the Fire Radiance Mountain Range. Beneath this vast land lies an earth vein in the form of a fire dragon, perfectly resonating with the cultivation methods practiced by the Fire Radiance Sect’s disciples, allowing them to advance their realms rapidly here,” Bing Long softly explained to Yang Kai while Luo Li remained silent.

“But starting today, this place will no longer belong to Fire Radiance Sect,” Ran Yunting snorted coldly.

No sooner had she spoken than she seemed to notice something below; her gaze dropped, she reached out, and seized at empty air.

With a cry of panic, a cultivator wearing Fire Radiance Sect robes was plucked from somewhere within the forest and lifted onto the deck by Ran Yunting.

The man looked to be thirty or forty years old and of low cultivation—First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—and Ran Yunting had completely suppressed his Saint Yuan. When he landed on the deck and saw so many slender and beautiful women, his heart dropped and he immediately understood, shouting, “People of Ice Heart Valley, what are you doing here? You invade the Fire Radiance Mountain Range on such a scale—are you intending to wage war against my Fire Radiance Sect?”

“Wage war?” Ran Yunting sneered. “When have Ice Heart Valley and our Fire Radiance Sect ever ceased fighting?”

The cultivator’s expression froze; he was left speechless.

Indeed, the two powers that dominated Chi Lan Star had never been at peace; minor skirmishes occurred constantly, but brazenly invading another power’s territory as they had today had never happened.

“What do you intend to do?” The Fire Radiance cultivator still showed some backbone; despite his far lower cultivation he still dared to question so many superior experts.

“What do we intend?” Ran Yunting scoffed. “Of course we intend to crush your Fire Radiance Sect flat!”

The man went pale, his eyes wide as he stared at Ran Yunting as if to determine whether she was serious.

“Your cultivation is decent; you seem to hold some status in Fire Radiance Sect. Hurry back and tell Wei Qing that I, Ran Yunting, have come—tell him to wash his neck clean.”

“Ran Yunting!” the man cried in terror.

He had, of course, heard of Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder; turning to look around, he suddenly realized every woman’s cultivation was profound and instinctively cried out, “My Fire Radiance Sect has the Grand Elder seated in the sect—do not act rashly!”

“You mean that old monster Chi Huo?” Ran Yunting sneered. “Chi Huo is already dead; it seems you know nothing.”

“The Grand Elder is dead?” The man’s eyes trembled as he exclaimed, “Impossible—the Grand Elder is a Void King Realm expert; who among you could possibly have the power to kill him?”

“If you doubt it, go ask Wei Qing yourself; this elder has no time to waste on you!” Ran Yunting stopped speaking and threw the cultivator off the warship.

In midair the cultivator hastily circulated his Saint Yuan to arrest his fall, glanced at the five grim and terrifying warships, gritted his teeth, and plunged into the depths of the Fire Radiance Mountain Range—clearly to report the news.

“Let us at least give them a warning; that will do—give them time to prepare so no one can accuse Luo Li of bullying the weak,” Luo Li had paid no attention to the earlier commotion and only spoke faintly after that cultivator disappeared from sight.

The fleet continued forward at an unhurried pace, yet an invisible, terrifying pressure slowly descended, blanketing the entire Fire Radiance Mountain Range.

After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, a clamoring uproar arose from the Fire Radiance Sect’s main headquarters.

“Ice Heart Valley has launched a major invasion?”

“Their gall is boundless.”

“It seems the lesson they received before was insufficient—haha, they came on their own this time; we shall teach them a harsh lesson.”

“I hear Ice Heart Valley’s more than a dozen elders are peerless beauties; we never had a chance to capture them before, but now they’ve come to us—good, good, I’ll capture a few and give them a proper...education.”

“Elder Qi, at your age you should not indulge in such thoughts.”

“I am old but still vigorous—why fear not satisfying a few lowly wenches?”

“That may be; those lowly wenches will certainly yield before Elder Qi’s might.”

The group of Elders seemed quite optimistic. Upon hearing that Ice Heart Valley had taken the initiative to attack, they not only showed no sign of worry but even appeared overjoyed. Just thinking about the pitiful cries those tender women of Ice Heart Valley would let out before dying — or their struggles when being ravaged — filled these Elders with twisted excitement.

Destroying the sacred and violating purity has always been what men find most irresistible—the thing that brings out a man’s baser beastliness.

Ice Heart Valley’s women had long been presented as sacred and pure.

“Sect Master, please make arrangements quickly; let us go and deal with those lowly wenches,” one elder said to Wei Qing, who sat at the head.

Wei Qing glanced at him when he heard this; worry deepened between his brows.

“Sect Master, what do you mean…” Many elders discerned something in Wei Qing’s expression; the clamor gradually subsided as they all looked at him with suspicion.

“A great calamity has befallen Fire Radiance Sect!” Wei Qing sighed heavily.

The elders’ faces changed.

“Sect Master, what do you mean?” The elder who had spoken earlier looked grave. “Ice Heart Valley is powerful, but for them to launch a full-scale invasion against our Fire Radiance Sect presents a perfect opportunity to teach them a lesson—how could this be a calamity for us?”

“Because…the Grand Elder may already have fallen.”

At these words the hall fell into silence.

After a long while an elder said in a trembling voice, “That cannot be, Sect Master—are you joking?”

“At a time like this, would I jest with you?” Wei Qing said sternly.

“But…how could the Grand Elder have fallen? And Lord Luo Hai—hasn’t he always dwelt with the Grand Elder in the rear mountains?”

Wei Qing rubbed his forehead. “Several months ago the Grand Elder and Lord Luo Hai had already left Fire Radiance Sect and gone to Ice Heart Valley; they have not returned since.”

“That still does not prove the Grand Elder has fallen.” Someone refused to believe, clinging to a shred of hope, but even their voice lacked conviction.

If the Grand Elder had not fallen, how could he fail to return to Fire Radiance Sect?

If the Grand Elder had not fallen, why would Ice Heart Valley be so overwhelmingly aggressive?

Clearly they knew something, and thus seized the opportunity to strike.

“Luo Li of Ice Heart Valley could not possibly have slain the Grand Elder—could it have been Lord Luo Hai?” someone cried out.

Only Luo Hai possessed the strength to kill their sect’s Grand Elder. But wasn’t it rumored that the two had always been on good terms? Moreover, when Lord Luo Hai visited Chi Lan Star this time, he had been staying as a guest of the Fire Radiance Sect all along — so how had he suddenly turned on their Grand Elder and struck him down?
