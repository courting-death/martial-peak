## Chapter 1501 — You Have No Choice

The addition of the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird and the Jade-Green Giant Dragon plunged the warriors of the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect into even deeper despair.

Back when Yang Kai first obtained the Fire Bird, its strength was not especially great, but over the years it refined three wisps of Sun’s True Fire, and last time it refined two strands of Qiantian Thunderfire; with each refinement, it underwent tremendous growth.

As it stands now, the Fire Bird can single-handedly take on a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator without the slightest difficulty.

Rarer still, it possesses its own intelligence, knows how to seize opportunities to meet the enemy, and has no need for Yang Kai to control it.

As for the Dragon Bone Sword’s transformation, the Jade-Green Giant Dragon, although it falls short of the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit in intellect, it is, after all, refined from the remains of an ancient being; its intangible dragon might alone weighs upon foes like a mountain, and under Yang Kai’s control it moves as if an extension of his arm, sweeping aside all before it.

Moreover, it is a Secret Treasure that can continue to grow; whether this stems from a divine ability the ancient being possessed or something else is unknown, but the martial artists who die under its claws have their Essence-Blood devoured, further amplifying its power.

Fireballs and Blazing Flame spewed from the Fire Bird’s beak, and with a sweep of its wings, blades of fire like keen knives shot out in all directions; meanwhile, the Jade-Green Giant Dragon gaped wide, exhaling a miasma of poison so thick it seemed corporeal—this was Green Dragon’s poison, and even Origin Returning Realm cultivators dared not test its edge.

Miserable screams rang out one after another as enemies fell beneath the assaults of the Fire Bird and the Dragon Bone Sword, cut down as easily as harvesting straw.

"Sect Master Yang, would you come out and speak with this old man?" Liang Yong’s expression shifted, sweat pouring down his face like rain as he desperately urged his own Secret Treasure to form a defense; beset on all sides by three Ninth-Tier cloud beasts, he could barely hold on—watching his companions die one by one before his eyes, he finally panicked, realizing that this time his odds were grim.

If it were only Yang Kai alone, with the lineup they had brought today, perhaps they could have taken him with ease.

But with so many powerful aids added to the fray, that notion was no longer realistic.

He did not want to die here.

"At this point, what is there left to talk about?" Yang Kai’s mocking voice drifted from the void. Liang Yong strained to seek his trace but could not get his wish in the least. Seeing the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, after finishing off a companion, fly straight toward him, Liang Yong turned ashen and hurriedly said, "Do you think this affair was something my Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect wanted to do to you? If you truly think so, you are gravely mistaken."

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai was indeed taken aback.

"Liang Yong, if you dare to leak secrets, beware of dying a miserable death!" On the other side, the Leitai Sect’s Vice Sect Master Situ Hong barked harshly.

No sooner had his voice fallen than more than a dozen golden threads manifested in the void; those Golden Blood Threads twisted together and swiftly condensed into the form of a spear, and with a slight tremble, it shot toward Situ Hong.

Situ Hong was already at the end of his rope, barely fending off the cloud beasts’ frenzy; at this moment, how could he have any spare strength to guard against that golden spear?

With a strangled cry, he roused his Saint Yuan to form a protective layer outside his body, hoping to block the blow.

But he far underestimated the lethality of the Golden Blood Threads; they are peerlessly sharp to begin with, and after Yang Kai comprehended many of the principles of change, that sharpness gained a few more measures of might.

The golden spear arrived before Situ Hong in an instant, treated that protection as if it were nothing, pierced through it with ease, and punched a hole straight through his body.

Fortunately, at the final moment, Situ Hong twisted his body, avoiding the vital point; powerful as the strike was, it did not take his life.

But that was as far as it went.

The cloud beasts that had been besieging him surged forward together and submerged him in an instant.

A shrill scream echoed out, making the few who were still clinging to life break out in a cold sweat; within three breaths, the Leitai Sect Vice Sect Master’s voice cut off abruptly, his life aura snuffed out entirely.

"Now you may speak." Yang Kai’s voice came from somewhere.

Liang Yong turned his head and saw that Yang Kai had already shown himself, standing not far away and staring at him with a face like frost; the cloud beasts that had been pressing him seemed to receive some command, stopped applying pressure, and instead drew back, baring their fangs as they glared at him wolfishly.

Two more screams rang out; the last two remaining companions also fell at this moment.

Casting his gaze around, Liang Yong saw that in this bizarre world, only he and Yang Kai yet lived; each fallen companion looked wretched to the extreme—there was no flesh left upon the bones, as if their Essence-Blood had been swallowed clean by something, and not even a trace of soul had leaked free.

Annihilation in the truest sense—body and soul both erased!

One must know that for a martial artist at the Origin Returning Realm, upon death, powerful Divine Sense will overflow from the Sea of Consciousness and dissipate into heaven and earth; that overflow is rapid and easy to perceive. Yet at this moment, Liang Yong could not detect the slightest trace.

He did not know what in the world was going on.

But the weirdness before his eyes plainly made his scalp tingle.

With a gulp, Liang Yong tasted a fear he had not felt in nearly one hundred years.

"Will you speak, or will you not?" Yang Kai pressed him, impatience showing on his face.

"At this point, this old man has nothing left to hide. If Sect Master Yang wishes to know, this old man will hold nothing back—ask, and I will answer!" Liang Yong drew a deep breath; his expression looked calm enough, but the torment in his heart was his alone to know.

"Then tell me—what did you mean just now?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at him.

"If this old man tells you, will Sect Master Yang spare me a path to live?" Liang Yong gave a bitter smile.

"What do you think?" Yang Kai grinned.

"Whether to spare or to kill lies entirely in a single thought of Sect Master Yang; since you wish to know certain secrets, this old man can tell you—but who does thankless things?" Liang Yong shook his head.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, a chill spilling from their depths. After pondering for a while, he finally nodded and said, "Fine. If what you tell me proves valuable enough, I can leave you a dog’s life. In any case, you are merely following orders, and you and I have had no past enmity. But if you are only stalling for time, I will make you beg for death!"

"Be at ease—this old man can guarantee the information will greatly interest Sect Master Yang. But words alone are no proof; may this old man trust Sect Master Yang?"

"You have no choice!" Yang Kai snorted coldly and stepped forward.

The cloud beasts clustered around Liang Yong rumbled low in their throats, itching to pounce, as if only waiting for a single command from Yang Kai to rush up and tear the enemy to pieces.

"Very well—under another’s eaves, one must lower one’s head. This old man will speak." Liang Yong raised his hands quickly, his face changing.

“Good thing you know your place.” Yang Kai sneered.

"This matter…" Liang Yong furrowed his brows as if weighing his words, and slowly said, "In truth, in this matter, our Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect were merely acting on orders."

"Acting on orders?" Yang Kai was surprised. "Whose orders?"

"This…" Liang Yong’s face hesitated, and there was even a faint flavor of dread within. "Even if this old man does not say it, with Sect Master Yang’s intelligence, you should have no trouble guessing, no?"

Yang Kai stared at him suspiciously and very quickly understood. "You are saying, Star Emperor Mountain?"

He was hardly a newcomer to Dark Star, an ignorant Saint Realm cultivator—after so many years here, he knew well the renown of the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect. To make those two great forces join hands against him, besides Star Emperor Mountain there was no one else.

"This old man has said nothing; that is merely Sect Master Yang’s own conjecture." Liang Yong hastened to wash his hands of it. But from his bearing and tone, Yang Kai already knew he was right.

It was just that… he had no dealings with Star Emperor Mountain, did he?

"Was it still because of the Warship?" Yang Kai asked coldly.

"That is one reason; the second is because of a person." As a senior figure of the two forces, Liang Yong naturally knew some of the details of this operation.

"Elder Ye!" Yang Kai immediately thought of Ye Xijun.

She had been the previous master of Star Emperor Mountain; for some unknown reason, she left. Now it seemed there was still enmity between Ye Xijun and Star Emperor Mountain.

Yes—last time she was even poisoned. To be able to poison her, the enemy’s strength must have been anything but ordinary; could it have been them as well?

Seeing Yang Kai fall into thought, Liang Yong stood on edge waiting. After quite a while, he probed, "Sect Master Yang, this old man has said all that should be said—are you satisfied?"

“No loose ends?” Yang Kai’s gaze was cold as ice. “You’d best understand — even if there are a dozen more outside, they might not be enough to stop me. And if I find out you’ve been holding something back… heh, tell me, Elder Liang — do you have any sons or daughters showing you filial respect?”

Liang Yong’s face changed; a struggle flashed in his eyes, and he gritted his teeth. "Sect Master Yang must beware that old fellow in a brown robe with grizzled hair!"

“Oh?” Yang Kai looked at him with a half-smile, studying him for a moment before nodding. “Very well, I understand. Elder Liang, you’ve shown some thoughtfulness.”

Liang Yong could not help but pant in great gulps; this feeling of hanging by a thread was truly unbearable.

"Sect Master Yang, this old man knows nothing more. So then…"

"Rest easy. I keep my word." Yang Kai nodded lightly. As he had just said, he and Liang Yong had had no prior enmity—killing him or not mattered little.

With a stir of his Divine Sense, the cloud beasts around them once more turned into fleecy white clouds and floated up into the sky.

And that strange formation world itself warped and blurred, then quickly shattered apart.

When Liang Yong came back to his senses, he found himself once again outside the palace. Around him, the remaining dozen or so companions were staring in stunned bewilderment.

But in the next instant, their gazes turned to horror.

The ground was strewn with bones, without the slightest scrap of flesh, as if these remains had weathered wind and sun for countless years until only stark white skeletons were left.

Such is the end when the Dragon Bone Sword devours away the fleshly essence.

Encircled by those skeletons, Yang Kai stood unscathed, a mocking smile on his face; apart from him, only Liang Yong was still alive.

The rest had all perished, not a single survivor.
