## Chapter 743 — What the Hell Do They Have to Do With It?

"What is the Miss thinking about again?" A maid standing beside the Saintess could not help asking when she remained motionless for a couple of hours.

"Nothing." The Saintess slowly shook her head, a faint sorrow flowing across her brow.

"Is Miss wondering whether this time you'll be able to find the Saint Lord?" Bei'er pursed her lips and smiled.

"I don't want to find any Saint Lord!" The Saintess sighed lightly.

"But that's your duty, Miss." Bei'er's face fell noticeably.

"I know — isn't that what I'm doing? But he didn't appear. What can I do?"

"Wouldn't it be best if he never appeared at all, then Miss wouldn't have to worry her mind away."

"Shh!" The Saintess hastily raised a jade finger to her lips, cast a quick glance outside, and whispered, "You can say that to me, but don't say it out loud. If Qian Shu and the others hear it, that would be bad."

"I know." Bei'er flashed a coy smile. "But Miss needn't fret too much; our Sacred Land has four Saintesses in total. Besides you, the other three are also searching — maybe one of them will find him."

"It won't be good no matter who finds him." The Saintess sighed faintly, rose to her feet and said, "Sitting is wearisome; let's go for a walk."

"Mm." Bei'er quickly nodded.

They came out onto the deck and watched for a while; the Saintess's mood lightened considerably, and she suddenly remembered Yang Kai and immediately asked one of the disciples aboard.

When she learned Yang Kai had been staying belowdecks and had not come out, the Saintess could not help frowning.

Owing to her unusual birth, she could more or less probe others' true thoughts; when she had seen Yang Kai before, though she understood he had no hostility, she still felt something odd about him — a veil of mystery that even the observant Saintess could not pierce.

Knowing he was safe and sound, she had no intention of seeking him out; after resting a while she returned to the cabin.

Days passed. After about a month at sea, Yang Kai, who had been meditating in the cabin, suddenly caught a scent that filled him with longing.

It was the smell of earth.

He hurried to the window and sure enough saw several irregularly scattered islands on the distant horizon.

Startled, Yang Kai stood up.

Being cooped up in the cabin for so long had nearly driven him mad; now, seeing land, he could finally leave that cramped space and felt uplifted.

Half a day later the ship moored beside an island. Footsteps sounded outside, and before long the burly man Cheng Fei pushed open the door and bellowed, "Kid, we're here — come out!"

Yang Kai bowed slightly and followed him out.

On the deck the Sacred Land's disciples were disembarking in an orderly fashion. Along the shoreline a number of local power-holders stood to greet them respectfully, one after another wearing genial expressions.

Yang Kai saw the Saintess on the deck, hesitated a moment, and then walked toward her.

His movement immediately drew many eyes; Qian Shu's True Yuan surged as he regarded Yang Kai with ill intent.

It seemed that if Yang Kai made any improper move, he would instantly face merciless annihilation.

Yang Kai pretended not to notice, strolled to a spot near the Saintess, cupped his fists and said, "Thank you for rescuing me this time; I shall remember it always. I wish you eternal youth and long life!"

The Saintess's lashes trembled; she suddenly pursed her lips and smiled. Yang Kai's words were unlike those of others and took her by surprise. She inclined her head slightly and said, "You're welcome. Be careful in future; don't drift upon the sea again."

"Thank you for your concern. Farewell!"

Saying that, Yang Kai leaped down from the great ship and left swiftly.

"Smooth-tongued scoundrel!" Qian Shu, who plainly disliked Yang Kai, snorted coldly.

"I actually think he seems sincere." The Saintess watched Yang Kai's receding figure and smiled.

Below deck many of the warriors, young and old, were entranced by that smile, staring blankly until Qian Shu's heavy snort snapped them back to their senses and they became awkwardly embarrassed.

Yang Kai disembarked and strolled across the island.

There were many warriors coming and going, but the Spiritual Qi on this island was somewhat thin, not as thick or pleasant as the isles held by the Water Divine Hall.

Moreover, the island did not seem to harbor many experts; among the local power-holders who came to welcome the Sacred Land, the strongest was only of the Transcendent Realm's second Stage, an elderly man with white hair on the cusp of death.

Judging by appearances, the nearby isles were no great shakes either — places held by small factions, not comparable to the Water Divine Hall at all.

From the comings and goings one could tell outsiders could not enter the Water Divine Hall there, whereas here there seemed to be many outsiders.

After wandering a while, Yang Kai stepped into an inn, took a seat by the window and had the server bring food and drink.

The server obliged, and before long returned with many exquisite dishes. Just as he was about to leave, Yang Kai stopped him.

"Anything else, sir?" the server asked with a smile.

Yang Kai said nothing, pulling out two Crystal Stones and placing them on the table.

The server’s eyes lit up; he immediately plastered on a fawning smile and stammered, “Honored guest, these dishes don’t cost two Crystal Stones.”

“I have some questions. If your answers satisfy me, the rest will be yours.”

“Ask whatever you like, honored guest! I’ll tell you everything I know, without holding anything back!” the server vowed.

Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction, pondered a moment and then asked, "What place is this?"

The server looked at Yang Kai in surprise and laughed, "You don't know where you are? How did you get here…"

He stopped mid-sentence when he saw Yang Kai's expression, and hastily explained, "This is Haiqing Island…"

"Which of the respectable factions are present here?"

"Here, there are the Cheng Family, the Wang Family, the Hai Family…" The server rattled off names as if they were cherished trinkets.

After hearing his account, Yang Kai realized these nearby islands belonged to an organization called the Seven Families Alliance.

There were roughly twenty to thirty isles nearby, occupied by seven great houses. Their strength was roughly comparable and not particularly mighty; the strongest within each clan were only at the Transcendent Realm's second Stage, and the number of Transcendents was scant — barely four or five in each family.

When Yang Kai asked how far the Water Divine Hall was, the server's answer left him dumbfounded.

It turned out he had followed the Sacred Land's ship in the opposite direction and was already tens of thousands of li from the Water Divine Hall.

Learning this, Yang Kai could only shake his head in resignation; it seemed impossible to return to the Water Divine Hall to thank Shui Ling in person — he would have to wait for another chance.

And the nearest mainland would still take about a month by fast ship.

"Is there an Alchemists' Association here?" Yang Kai frowned and asked.

The server shook his head.

What a backwater! Yang Kai thought disdainfully. Even the Alchemists' Council had not bothered to establish a branch here — it was plainly desolate.

"Are you an alchemist?" The server was shrewd and had perceived something from Yang Kai's line of questioning.

"Why do you ask?" Yang Kai glanced at him.

"The Seven Families Alliance is vigorously recruiting alchemists right now; the pay is top-notch. If you want to make some coin, you should try applying."

Yang Kai curled his lips slightly — he was clearly uninterested.

Pay meant little to him now; he only wished to advance his alchemical skill, but judging by the Seven Families Alliance's level, there would be no good materials for him to refine.

"By the way, what are all these other guests talking about? Why are they all dressed so fine and carrying themselves so urbane?" Yang Kai asked.

Since arriving he had noticed the young men all appeared prim and proper, not only fastidious in dress and speech but with refined manners as if exquisitely raised.

Not only the young — some middle-aged men were the same, constantly monitoring their deportment as though invisible eyes watched their every move.

This puzzled Yang Kai; he could not tell whether it was local custom or some other cause.

"You don't know?" The server suddenly wore a sly smile and his expression turned ambiguous.

"I should know?" Yang Kai shot him an uncivil look and, to stop more chatter, produced two more Crystal Stones and laid them on the table.

The server was quick to seize the stones, thanked him profusely and, glancing around, leaned close to whisper in Yang Kai's ear, "The Sacred Land's Saintess is visiting today. They're all putting on airs on purpose."

Yang Kai frowned. "The Saintess being here — what the hell does that have to do with them?"

"Of course it's related!" The server, surprised Yang Kai truly did not know, explained earnestly, "When the Saintess tours, she is seeking the next Saint Lord for the Sacred Land! If the Saintess takes a fancy to someone, it's like a fish leaping the dragon gate — one soars and becomes a phoenix!"

"With these people?" Yang Kai glanced about at the shabby lot preening themselves and felt nauseated. With a disdainful sneer he said, "The Saintess would have to be blind to pick this rabble."

"Shh…" The server's face changed; he looked around warily and whispered, "You can't say that aloud or you'll draw the crowd's wrath. Besides, who the Saintess will choose is not for us to know. Every time the Sacred Land's Saintess tours it stirs up a commotion. Half a year ago news of her touring went out and the world was shaken; countless young talents prepared in secret. As a result, Haiqing Island began to bustle fully half a month ago — everyone has been waiting for the Saintess's arrival. In former times this place was never so lively."
