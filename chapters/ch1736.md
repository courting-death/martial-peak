## Chapter 1736 — Three Swords Shining Together

Li Minghai and Gu Jianxin's gazes collided in the void, sparks of fierce intensity flaring out.

Li Minghai's brow knitted slightly.

He found, to his shock, that Gu Jianxin's aura was denser and more condensed than the last time he had seen him.

The rumors were not false; barring any accidents, Young Alliance Master Gu Jianxin could, within the next three to five years, break through to the Void King Realm.

If he succeeded in rising to the Void King Realm, given his special Taixu Sword Physique and the coordination with his left and Right Sword Servants, within the First Stage of the Void King Realm there would probably be no one who could stand against him; even those at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm he could contend with.

A monster! No wonder Deputy Alliance Master Wei Qianzong was so eager to eliminate Gu Jianxin — clearly he had detected how terrifyingly fast Gu Jianxin was growing.

Fortunately, there was this rare opportunity. As long as they could kill Gu Jianxin and his group, the Sword Alliance would thereafter belong entirely to the Vice Alliance Master’s faction. A genius who fails to grow… is no true genius at all!

"Li Minghai," Gu Jianxin said, hands clasped behind his back as he stood on the deck, "This Young Master asks only one thing: how did you know I would pass this way?"

Li Minghai's eyes narrowed; his voice was cold: "The Alliance Master's mind already holds the answer. Why ask this old man?"

Gu Jianxin nodded slightly. "It seems this Young Master indeed has someone around him who is not to be trusted. Fine — after this matter I will root them out."

"Alliance Master, you'd better not concern yourself with that. You have no future!" Li Minghai said, waving his hand as he barked, "Kill them all — don't spare a single one!"

If even one of them escaped, they would suffer grave trouble someday; this operation had been intended from the start to leave no survivors.

At Li Minghai's order, the Origin Returning Realm warriors beside him sprang into action, breaking into groups and attacking the warriors who had just escaped with bloodthirsty intent.

A great number of warriors also poured out from the warship where Gu Jianxin stood, rushing forward without hesitation to meet them.

For a time, the stretch of Star Domain surrounding the Meteorite Sea was filled with dazzling multicolored radiance as the might of countless Secret Treasures and arcane arts burst forth in unending succession.

Li Minghai's side was few in number — at most thirty — but each was an expert of at least the Origin Returning Realm Second Stage. Their combat strength was therefore vicious. Gu Jianxin's side numbered around two hundred, but their levels varied; their top-end strength could not match Li Minghai's faction.

More crucially, Li Minghai himself, a Void King Realm cultivator, sat behind them; his mere presence was oppressive. The Origin Returning Realm warriors on Gu Jianxin's side could not hope to fight at full strength.

Once the two sides engaged, warriors kept falling — and almost all were from Gu Jianxin's side, while Li Minghai's faction suffered no casualties.

In an instant Li Minghai's side surged like a tide, crushing Gu Jianxin's forces into cries of torment.

The battle had begun, but Li Minghai did not rush to finish things; he stared at Gu Jianxin and the two women at his side, a serious expression gradually settling between his brows.

It seemed the man and the two women before him were opponents worth taking seriously.

He did not move, and the disadvantaged Gu Jianxin therefore dared not act rashly; he could only watch his subordinates fall one by one, his eyes full of murderous fury.

After a long while Li Minghai spoke coolly: "Young Alliance Master, will you take action yourself, or do you need this old man to send you on your way?"

"Old dog Li, do you think you've got this Young Master figured out?" Gu Jianxin barked coldly.

Li Minghai slowly shook his head. "If I dare to act here, I had prepared beforehand. The Young Master is a paragon among men, bearing the Taixu Sword Physique and having trained alongside his left and Right Sword Servants, their minds connected; he is indeed hard to deal with. But… you have not yet reached the Void King Realm. If you had, I would not be your match. Alas, Alliance Master, today you are destined not to escape."

"Whether I can escape or not, you'll see!" Gu Jianxin roared, a snow-white long sword suddenly appearing in his hand as his body wrapped in sword light and he sprang from the deck.

The sword light rose like a round sun, a light dome covering the land — a ferocity beyond measure.

At the same moment he moved, the two women who had been standing behind him also sprang into action. Just like Gu Jianxin, each drew her own longsword-shaped Secret Treasure, their figures enveloped in sword light as they followed closely behind him.

Unlike Gu Jianxin, the two women's sword light manifested as a crescent moon and a field of stars; their sword light fell like moonlight pouring down and stars filling the sky.

The three sword lights merged midflight into one, emitting a power surpassing the Origin Returning Realm, as if to cut through heaven and earth; long tails of sword light trailed as they came down upon Li Minghai.

Li Minghai's eyes shone; he seemed moved by their secret technique and shouted: "The Sun–Moon–Star Three-Swords Shining Secret Technique lives up to its name! With this strike alone, Young Alliance Master could sweep the Origin Returning Realm. Pity… your left and Right Sword Servants are weaker, and you are not of the Void King Realm. Let this old man tell you how great the gap between the Void King Realm and the Origin Returning Realm truly is!"

As he spoke, an invisible force spread out from Li Minghai's body.

A Domain Field!

It had been a full five hundred years since Li Minghai had ascended to the Void King Realm. He could already be considered a veteran expert of that realm. Although his Domain Field’s power was not particularly overwhelming due to his cultivation having stagnated, it was still a Domain Field nonetheless!

Those under the Domain Field's cover at the Origin Returning Realm were destined to be utterly suppressed, unable to act.

Yet Li Minghai's Domain Field failed to hinder Gu Jianxin and the two in the slightest; from the three merged sword lights another different power rippled out and easily pierced through Li Minghai's Domain Field.

A flash of light flickered through Li Minghai’s eyes as he shouted in a low voice, “The Bright Sea Dividing Domain Mirror! So the Alliance Master truly granted you this wondrous treasure!”

The Bright Sea Dividing Domain Mirror, a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure, could, when used, largely resist the Domain Field of a Void King Realm expert; against a not-very-strong opponent it could even shatter the Domain Field.

Across the Star Domain it was famous; after all, there were not many Secret Treasures capable of resisting a Domain Field.

With that treasure's power, Gu Jianxin and his two Sword Servants were not suppressed by Li Minghai's Domain Field and still delivered their attack to Li Minghai.

Facing the Sun–Moon–Star three-sword technique, Li Minghai did not take it lightly; a spear Secret Treasure — the one that had attacked Yang Kai earlier — suddenly appeared in his palm. Saint Yuan surged into it, scattering blossoms of spear-flashes; the spear tip unleashed terrifying force as he engaged the three in close combat.

Clang, clang — the sounds rang out in an instant.

Spear shadows and sword light filled the vast space; the figures of Li Minghai and the three around Gu Jianxin were almost indistinguishable.

Far off, Yang Kai stared in astonishment at the scene, his face full of wonder.

To fight a Void King Realm with Origin Returning Realm cultivation was not something done lightly, yet Gu Jianxin had managed it. Although he relied on the two women, he had not faltered in the short time.

Moreover, those two women were clearly weaker than Gu Jianxin, appearing only at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Still, the secret technique they cultivated could combine three forces into one, producing strength beyond the Origin Returning Realm.

This Alliance Master of the Sword Alliance was indeed impressive!

When the battle began, Yang Kai had already crept out from his hiding place to the spot nearest the fight and concealed himself to observe.

He focused eighty percent of his attention on Li Minghai, waiting for a suitable chance to strike.

Attacking a Void King Realm expert like Li Minghai without the right timing would only raise his vigilance, so Yang Kai could only wait patiently.

He had worried that Gu Jianxin and the others might be beaten in a single blow, but now it seemed the Young Alliance Master could at least hold his own for a while.

While observing, Yang Kai noticed several streaks of retreating light heading toward the Meteorite Sea.

Clearly the battlefield was expanding — some defeated warriors were attempting escape, and the meteor-strewn Meteorite Sea was the best place to flee.

Ahead of them fled two weaker cultivators, looking to be women from their builds, while warriors from Li Minghai's side gave chase.

From the escape lights it seemed the two fleeing women were only at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — such cultivation was nearly useless in such a battle.

The pursuer was of the Origin Returning Realm Second Stage; the disparity was great. That the two had managed to break out of the fight at all was a miracle.

Because Li Minghai had ordered no survivors, that Origin Returning Realm Second Stage warrior had no intention of letting the two women go; he pressed on relentlessly, the distance closing fast.

The two women clearly cared for one another and did not abandon each other during the escape, staying close; Yang Kai felt helpless because their path was toward his hiding place.

It would not be long before they flew right past where he hid.

With a quiet sigh Yang Kai prepared to act.

Moments later the two women did indeed sweep past the meteor near Yang Kai's concealment; so close, and continually scanning for a hiding place, they immediately spotted Yang Kai.

Their gazes met; Yang Kai froze for an instant, and the two women were equally stunned.

At that moment, the Origin Returning Realm Second Stage pursuer arrived and shot out streaks of profound light toward the stunned pair.

Judging by the power of those attacks, even a full defense would likely still leave the two grievously wounded.

Yet the profound lights inexplicably dissipated halfway, as if they had never appeared.

"What the—?" the pursuer frowned, unprepared, when a flash of golden light cut along his neck like a thin golden thread.

His Saint Yuan's defenses were like paper; they offered no protection, and pain surged — the cultivator's vision went black.
