## Chapter 1727 — Three Months

"Is this the Taiqing Mountain Range where the Liuli Sect is located?" Su Yan asked, gazing down at the undulating ridges below, which lay like a coiled dragon.

"Mm." Standing beside her, Yang Kai nodded, released his Divine Sense and, taking advantage of being a Star Lord, swept it across tens of thousands of li, then smiled and said, "It looks like when the Corpse Spirit Sect ran rampant, the Liuli Sect's main headquarters wasn't heavily damaged—it's about the same as when I was here last time."

Xia Ningshang looked into the distance and said softly, "The Spiritual Qi on Dark Star really isn't comparable to the Tongxuan Continent; wherever we've gone these past days, whether in Spiritual Qi or scenery, it has far exceeded the Tongxuan Continent."

She appeared a little downcast.

Yang Kai was the Star Lord of Dark Star, while she was the Star Lord of Tongxuan Continent.
For every Star Lord, the Cultivation Star whose Stellar Origin they have refined is like their most intimate companion — even like their own child.

The Tongxuan Continent's desolation and lack of Spiritual Qi made Xia Ningshang feel somewhat sorrowful.

Yang Kai comforted her, "A Star Lord and a Cultivation Star are closely bound. Little Senior Sister, if you work hard to raise your cultivation, one day the Tongxuan Continent will be revitalized."

"Mm." Xia Ningshang obediently nodded.

"Let's go, Sect Master Gong should have received the news." Yang Kai took the two women's hands, one on either side, and flew forward with them.

Since that day they had begun touring Dark Star, and it had already been nearly three months.

In those three months the three of them had visited almost every famous scenic spot on Dark Star and seen many different customs and sights: the majestic expanse of the Wuyou Sea, the boundless silent desert. The towering perilous peaks of many famed mountains and rivers had all borne their footprints and figures.

Those three months of travel would surely become the fondest memories in the hearts of the three.

The Liuli Sect was Yang Kai's final stop.

They had not come merely to sightsee; Yang Kai intended to ask Gong Aofu for something.

Although during the Corpse Spirit Sect's rampage Gong Aofu had led the Liuli Sect to join the Lingxiao Sect and had even become one of Lingxiao Sect's elders, once the threat from the Corpse Spirit Sect had passed Yang Kai had allowed Gong Aofu to return to Taiqing Mountain.

He knew better than anyone what a sect meant to a martial artist.

Just as the sect he had established on Dark Star was called the Lingxiao Sect, and although Gong Aofu might have better prospects staying with Lingxiao Sect, in her heart she would always miss the Liuli Sect—the sect that had given her life and raised her.

Moreover, when Gong Aofu had first joined the Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai had said he would permit her to one day rebuild the Liuli Sect.

Letting her return was simply fulfilling that promise.

Gong Aofu was indeed full of gratitude; though she had led the Liuli Sect's martial artists back to Taiqing Mountain, she swore that from then on the Liuli Sect would be under the management of the Lingxiao Sect, serving as an affiliated sect.

This became Lingxiao Sect's first affiliated sect—and a very weighty one.

When Yang Kai had been hurrying over with Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, he had already sent word to Gong Aofu.

By the time they sped to the main peak of the Liuli Sect, a dense crowd was already standing below; at the head stood a beautiful woman, full of charm and shapely curves—naturally Gong Aofu.

Daiyuan still bore a face full of pockmarks, pits and hollows; she looked extremely ugly, and standing beside Gong Aofu she only served to make Gong Aofu's beauty stand out all the more.

Behind the two were the Liuli Sect's few remaining elders and elite disciples, with Yin Sudie among them.

Seeing Yang Kai's light descend, the crowd below instantly went solemn and bowed in unison.

“Subordinate Gong Aofu greets the Sect Master and pays respects to the two Madams!” Gong Aofu hurriedly said.

"We're not strangers—no need to be so polite, Gate Master Gong!" Yang Kai waved a hand, while Su Yan gave Gong Aofu a slight smile and accepted the address calmly; even with her veil, Xia Ningshang's cheeks were visibly flushed, her delicate earlobes as if dripping blood.

After so many years, Little Senior Sister was still shy by nature.

Yang Kai then turned to Daiyuan, his gaze carrying great meaning as it passed over her face; others did not know what beauty lay beneath that nauseating visage, but Yang Kai was well aware.

Daiyuan's figure was indeed exquisite and shapely, but her haughty demeanor was off-putting and made it hard for people to like her.

Yang Kai and Daiyuan were like heaven and earth; would a divine dragon soaring in the sky ever bother to look at the ants crawling below?

Thus almost no one knew why Yang Kai treated Daiyuan with such care.

Faced with Yang Kai's greeting, Daiyuan only nodded lightly, showing little enthusiasm.

Gong Aofu pursed her lips and smiled, "Your subordinate heard from the Great Elder that the Sect Master has been touring Dark Star these past months—has there been any gain?"

"Just looking at the scenery," Yang Kai chuckled and shook his head, "no real gains."

"The Sect Master and the two Madams are a perfect match—a natural pairing; it seems traveling together is itself the greatest gain."

Yang Kai, Su Yan and Xia Ningshang exchanged glances and shared a knowing smile.

Although they knew Gong Aofu's words were flattering, none of the three felt any resentment.

"But I do not know why the Sect Master has come to the Liuli Sect today—just for sightseeing? If so, I will do my utmost to make arrangements; Taiqing Mountain's scenery is also quite fine."

"Not that," Yang Kai shook his head, "I have a somewhat impertinent request."

"Speak freely, Sect Master!" Gong Aofu laughed coquettishly. "Without the Sect Master's care, my Liuli Sect would long since have ceased to exist. Whatever the Sect Master asks of my Liuli Sect is our honor to grant—there is no need to call it an impertinent request."

Seeing her so ready, Yang Kai nodded and said plainly, "I'm here to ask for some Thousand Illusions Glaze. Your Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain wasn't destroyed by the Corpse Spirit Sect, was it?"

"Thousand Illusions Glaze?" Gong Aofu's eyebrows lifted. "The Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain is a marvel of Heaven and Earth—the Corpse Spirit Sect couldn't destroy it. However, if the Sect Master wishes to obtain Thousand Illusions Glaze, it is somewhat difficult; despite all our years of accumulation, the Liuli Sect only has the equivalent of three taels—I'm not sure if that's enough for the Sect Master to use."

"Three taels is too little!" Yang Kai exclaimed with a wry laugh.

"Then... let Daiyuan employ her secret technique to extract some?" Gong Aofu asked solicitously.

Throughout the Liuli Sect, only Daiyuan, who had cultivated a special secret art, could refine the Thousand Illusions Glaze and extract portions of that strange substance.

So even though the Liuli Sect possessed the rare treasure of the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain, they had long been unable to make use of it—truly a lamentable situation.

"I can't extract much either, but I suppose Yang Kai has his own method!" Daiyuan's enchanting eyes shone as she looked toward Yang Kai.

"How presumptuous!" Gong Aofu snapped, her beautiful eyes stern as she glared at Daiyuan. "How dare you directly call the Sect Master by name?"

Though her tone seemed scolding, her attention was wholly on Yang Kai; when she saw he did not look angered, she breathed easier.

"It doesn't matter—Daiyuan and I have known each other for a long time; calling names is no great offense," Yang Kai said with a soft smile.

Daiyuan bared her silver teeth and shot Yang Kai an annoyed glare.

Before the Corpse Spirit Sect ravaged Dark Star, she and Yang Kai had been friends and had always called him by name; now, however, this fellow had risen to a position where he could command her master.

Daiyuan felt extremely uncomfortable.

"The Sect Master is magnanimous—this is my fault for being remiss in guiding Daiyuan," Gong Aofu bowed, then changed the subject, "Sect Master, do you indeed have a way to extract the Thousand Illusions Glaze yourself?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

"In that case it will be convenient; Sect Master may extract as much as he wishes. After all, we do not know how to utilize the Thousand Illusions Glaze—Sect Master, please come with me."

Gong Aofu spoke and immediately led the way.

Yang Kai, Su Yan and Xia Ningshang hurried to follow.

The Liuli Sect's martial artists, curious to see by what means Yang Kai would extract the Thousand Illusions Glaze, naturally clustered around to watch.

"You idiot!" Yin Sudie said to Daiyuan as the crowd drifted away, sounding exasperated, "When the Sect Master greeted you, why did you act so cold?"

"What else was I to do? Cling to him?" Daiyuan shot her a look.

Yin Sudie was momentarily at a loss, then suddenly giggled, "If it were me I'd cling to him—he's the most powerful person on Dark Star; clinging to him isn't shameful."

"You may think that, but do you imagine you can compare to the two women at his side?" Daiyuan sneered down at Yin Sudie.

Yin Sudie paused and, thinking of Su Yan and Xia Ningshang's bearing, couldn't help but feel dwarfed.

Su Yan need not be mentioned—her cold aura and presence were exceedingly strong, and with Su Yan there, Yin Sudie lacked even the courage to speak to Yang Kai.

Even that extremely gentle veiled woman carried a sacred, lofty, untouchable temperament—an air that made one feel ashamed.

"So what if I can't compare? As long as the Sect Master is pleased, I still have a chance!" Yin Sudie snorted coldly.

“I can’t be bothered to talk to you!” Daiyuan shot her a glare, her figure flickering as she too followed after the others.

"Stupid senior sister, ugly woman!" Yin Sudie cursed behind her, all claws and teeth.

Daiyuan pretended not to hear.

The Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain was composed entirely of Thousand Illusions Glaze; the material was unimaginably heavy and appeared plain and unadorned, but in truth Thousand Illusions Glaze naturally emanated Glazed Light.

The Glazed Light possessed miraculous properties: it could counter the Five Elements, restrain the body, and bind the soul.

Daiyuan had once given Yang Kai a Glazed Pearl—after she had swallowed Thousand Illusions Glaze it formed into a bead inside her, like a Demonic Beast's Inner Core; Yang Kai had refined it and fused it with the World-Ending Demon Eye, greatly enhancing the Demon Eye's power.

In addition, Thousand Illusions Glaze had peculiar and endlessly shifting qualities.

Rumor had it that if Thousand Illusions Glaze was used to forge a Secret Treasure, that treasure could change in countless ways during combat, leaving an enemy unable to guard against it.
