## Chapter 59 — The Mining Area

Leaving behind the bustling Black Wind Trade Market, the two of them, led by Hu Mei’er, headed northward toward the Black Wind Forest. Hu Mei’er appeared somewhat cheerful, her enchanting eyes filled with joy, and her cheeks flushed a rosy red.

"About what happened that day, my apologies!" Yang Kai suddenly spoke up, offering his apology. His words back then had indeed been somewhat harsh, and now, coming to ask for help, it felt a bit like double-dealing.

Hu Mei’er pursed her lips and smiled gently. "It's all right. You didn’t even curse me. Over these years, I’ve heard far worse, yet I’m still alive."

"You don’t hate me?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Hate you for what?" Hu Mei’er smiled softly, then added, "Actually, I did hate you at first, but... one of your actions made it impossible for me to hold that grudge."

"What action?"

"Heh, when Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao suddenly appeared that day, you stood in front of me. Perhaps it was an unconscious move, but it was the only time in all these years that someone truly wanted to protect me."

"I don’t remember that. But you’ve had a hard time." Yang Kai sighed. A young girl, perfectly fine, yet willing to ruin her own reputation just to help the Blood Battle Gang recruit more talent. Though her intentions were questionable, there was a filial heart hidden within.

"Hee hee..." Hu Mei’er giggled coquettishly. "There’s nothing difficult about it. Don’t you know that playing along is a woman’s instinct?"

"Heh, I haven’t really had much contact with women."

"Really?" Hu Mei’er’s eyes lit up.

"Yeah, so these days, you two sisters have taken full advantage of me," Yang Kai said with a straight face.

Hu Mei’er shot him a playful glare. "That’s a terrible thing to say! Luckily, my sister isn’t here. If she were, she’d definitely give you a good beating!"

"Your sister..."

"True Yuan Realm, First Stage!" Hu Mei’er answered proudly.

"Impressive!" Yang Kai praised.

Su Yan was at the Third Stage of the True Yuan Realm, and Hu Mei’er’s sister was slightly below her, but not by much.

Mentioning her sister, Hu Mei’er suddenly recalled something Yang Kai had said, and she laughed so hard she bent over, trembling with mirth, unable to close her mouth.

Yang Kai was speechless and could only stand still, waiting for her to catch her breath.

After a long while, Hu Mei’er finally calmed down, smiling as she said, "I’ve noticed you’re very bold. No man has ever dared speak to my sister like that. Is it true that... her figure is uneven?"

"Maybe it’s the clothes she wears. You should tell her not to worry about it," Yang Kai chuckled.

"What about mine? Is it really well-proportioned?" Hu Mei’er asked shyly, daring to inquire.

"Not only well-proportioned, but also round and firm," Yang Kai nodded. "You have a great figure. On this point, you need not belittle yourself."

Hu Mei’er felt overwhelmed. Such straightforward praise, without any ulterior motive, was probably the nicest thing she had heard in years.

For a moment, a secret joy swelled in her heart.

"How much longer until we arrive?" Yang Kai, not wanting to delve further into the topic, asked.

"About another hour’s walk. Although it’s still part of the Black Wind Forest, it’s the very heart of it," Hu Mei’er explained. "There’s an underground vein there, discovered by our Blood Battle Gang a few years ago. We stationed people there to mine it. The minerals there are quite peculiar."

"How so?" Yang Kai inquired.

"There are only two types of stones there: one is the Yang Flame Stone you bought, and the other is the Yin Element Stone. Strange, isn’t it? These two stones have opposing attributes and counteract each other, yet they grow together in that vein. No one knows why."

"That is truly rare," Yang Kai said, moved slightly.

The Yang Flame Stone contains Yang energy, while the Yin Element Stone holds Yin energy—opposing forces that normally cannot coexist.

"The gang’s experts also feel something is off about that mining area. But after years of investigation and mining, they haven’t found anything unusual. Still, our gang has made a good profit from it," Hu Mei’er spoke freely, as if Yang Kai were no outsider.

"This is the Blood Battle Gang’s blessing," Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Hu Mei’er hummed in agreement but soon fell silent. After walking for some time, she finally spoke again. "Actually, today is a stroke of luck. If you had missed today, you might not have been able to find me. That too is your fortune."

"Where are you going?" Yang Kai caught the implication behind her words.

"Nowhere in particular." Hu Mei’er shook her head, explaining while quietly observing Yang Kai’s expression. "After you scolded me last time, I suddenly realized my methods over the years were wrong. Relying on those vile means to recruit talent, they care not for the Blood Battle Gang but for me! I cannot give them what they want, so naturally, they won’t truly serve the gang. Therefore, I’ve decided to retreat into seclusion to cultivate. Once I grow strong, I can help my father shoulder the burden, just like my sister!"

"It’s good that you think that way," Yang Kai nodded.

Hu Mei’er’s expression turned somewhat disappointed. She noticed Yang Kai’s face had remained calm throughout, showing no emotional reaction to her words.

A faint bitterness crept into her heart, and she lost interest in continuing the conversation, silently leading the way.

With her silence, Yang Kai refrained from forcing the topic. After more than an hour’s walk, the two arrived at the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area.

This was the very center of the Black Wind Forest. Before them lay a mining area spanning over a dozen miles, designated by the Blood Battle Gang. Several buildings stood on the surface, providing living quarters and rest for the disciples.

Since the vein was underground, Yang Kai and Hu Mei’er saw little activity on the surface, only large holes leading deep below.

From nearly a hundred zhang away, Yang Kai felt a strong reaction from the Yang Source Seal on his chest—the response came from the underground Yang Flame Stones. As his strength grew, the range within which the Yang Source Seal could sense Yang energy had slightly increased, though not by much.

Their arrival caught the attention of the Blood Battle Gang disciples on the surface. Suddenly, an elderly man descended from the air, blocking their path. He cupped his fists and said, "Miss!"

"Grandpa Long," Hu Mei’er greeted warmly, pulling Yang Kai forward to introduce him. "This is our gang’s Deputy Leader, Long Zaitian, Grandpa Long."

Yang Kai quickly bowed. "Greetings, Senior Long."

Long Zaitian glanced at Yang Kai with disdain, ignoring him. With his Divine Roaming Realm strength and his lofty position as the Blood Battle Gang’s Deputy Leader, he saw no need to acknowledge a mere nobody like Yang Kai.

Another freeloader! Long Zaitian held a particular contempt for people like Yang Kai. Were it not for Hu Mei’er’s face, he would have slapped Yang Kai flat on the spot.

"Miss, what brings you to the mining area?" Long Zaitian stroked his white beard, his expression kindly. "This place is filthy and hot, not a place for you. You should go back quickly, or your father will scold me."

"That won’t happen. Father wouldn’t dare scold you. You’re one of the gang’s three elders; Father only respects you," Hu Mei’er cooed, playing the spoiled daughter. Long Zaitian’s face immediately lit up with pleasure.

"Grandpa Long, my friend wants to come to the mining area to find some disciples to buy a few things. Could you help us gain entry?" Hu Mei’er stated their purpose.
