## Chapter 978 — Plans for the Future

Changyuan had begun to understand what Yang Kai meant.

“I’ll head to the starry void—perhaps I can find some means there. That way, even if powerful enemies invade, we won’t be left without the strength to defend ourselves. Of course, it’s only a possibility; such things can’t be guaranteed.” Yang Kai shrugged.

From his own experiences over the past decade and more, he had glimpsed a similar path forward.

It's never wrong to make preparations before the rain.

"So... Saint Lord Yang intends to risk going into the starry sky for the continent's future?" Changyuan asked, his expression odd; he suddenly sneered, "You don't have such lofty altruism, do you?"

Although he hadn't spent much time with Yang Kai, Changyuan had his own methods of judging people. As a demon lord his eyesight was sharp and merciless, unlike ordinary men.

He felt that Yang Kai's eagerness to head to the starry sky wasn't as simple as he claimed; there had to be other reasons.

Yang Kai laughed and nodded. "There are indeed more important reasons, but those are personal matters I can't disclose. I can only promise they will bring no harm to the Demon Domain."

"I believe you!" Changyuan nodded lightly, then looked toward Li Rong with a trace of interest.

If Yang Kai truly left Tongxuan Continent, it wouldn't be impossible for him to accept Li Rong as a demon general. The Ancient Demon Clan were ferocious fighters and several of their leaders were formidable—if they joined, the Demon Domain would become all the more secure.

Most importantly, he might use Yang Kai's absence as an opportunity to persuade the Ancient Demon Clan to truly become part of his demons.

Changyuan was tempted.

"Li Rong, you are of the demon clan; the Demon Domain's environment suits your cultivation better. You going there would be better for the clan's development. Hmm, I think I once told the people of the Great Han the same thing a dozen years ago," Yang Kai said with a touch of nostalgia.

Li Rong and Han Fei's beautiful eyes brightened.

"Master, really—can't you take us with you?" Li Rong made a final plea.

Yang Kai shook his head.

The starry sky was too vast and too dangerous; he himself had no clear direction yet. He couldn't bring others along.

"Then the Ancient Demon Clan will await your good news, Master!" Li Rong bowed deeply and fell silent. She knew that once Yang Kai had made his decision, no amount of pleading would change it. "Until then, our clan will temporarily reside in the Demon Domain. I wonder if the Lord is willing to accept us."

"You are welcome!" Changyuan laughed heartily.

After returning to the place where the three races had gathered and speaking briefly, the various forces departed in triumph.

Each force came from different places. They traveled together for a while, then split up. Every faction had suffered heavy losses in the battle; they were eager to return to prepare supplies and recuperate their Yuan Qi.

More than ten days later, Yang Kai parted ways with Xu Hui and the others, telling them and Li Rong to return to the Sacred Land. He said he would make a trip to the Dragon-Phoenix Palace and would return soon.

Xu Hui left at the order.

"Let's go as well." Only after the people from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and the Ancient Demon Clan had gone a distance did Yang Kai smile at Chen Zhou.

Chen Zhou's expression was restrained, full of confusion and unease, but he did not dare ask directly and led the way.

After walking a while, Yang Kai suddenly asked, "Palace Master, were you about to ask about the Dragon Emperor?"

Chen Zhou was taken aback; his face turned serious and he clasped his fist. "If it's convenient, Saint Lord, could you explain?"

In the battle against the Bone Race the Dragon Emperor's might had reappeared, yet Sun Yu—the Dragon-Phoenix Palace's supposed successor to the Dragon Emperor—had not appeared on the battlefield.

Moreover, after that golden dragon dissolved, it clearly bore Yang Kai's silhouette.

When Yang Kai broke through into the Saint Realm and returned, Chen Zhou even saw a vivid, lifelike golden dragon pattern on him.

A series of signs left Chen Zhou with a vague understanding of the truth, though he could not be certain.

Naturally, he wanted to ask Yang Kai point-blank.

"It's time I gave you an explanation," Yang Kai said, bowing slightly, his face serious. "Before that, I must apologize to you, Palace Master, and to your sect. I lied to you."

Chen Zhou's body trembled; the expression on his face was one of "I thought so."

"Sun Yu is not the Dragon Emperor's successor! I am."

“Ah?” Elder Xiao Ling was greatly startled and stared at Yang Kai in astonishment.  

"The year the Dragon Valley inheritance opened wasn't because of Sun Yu. I accidentally entered it, and Sun Yu happened to rush in then and was swept up by the Dragon Emperor's inheriting energy. I stayed with him in Dragon Valley for two years."

"I didn't know the Dragon-Phoenix Palace very well, so I left Sun Yu there, asked him a few questions, and gave him some guidance in his cultivation."

"So you mean Sun Yu's huge breakthrough over those two years was because of Saint Lord Yang?" Chen Zhou's shock turned to sudden comprehension. He realized why Sun Yu's progress after leaving Dragon Valley had been somewhat underwhelming: while it had been faster than ordinary, it hadn't been the kind of aptitude a true Dragon Emperor successor should possess.

"Partly—he worked hard himself as well," Yang Kai said with an embarrassed laugh.

"And then the Youhan Grotto-Heaven attacked..."

"That too I quieted behind the scenes," Yang Kai admitted openly.

"No wonder Dragon Emperor... Sun Yu obeys and admires Saint Lord Yang so much—there was this reason behind it." Elder Xiao Ling exclaimed in sudden understanding. "I had even suspected with Elder Ling Jian when he could have become acquainted with someone like Saint Lord Yang; now it makes sense."

"But I still don't quite understand," Chen Zhou frowned. "If Saint Lord Yang is the Dragon Emperor's successor, why conceal it?"

The status of Dragon Emperor's successor was supremely honorable. Sun Yu had been propelled to the highest position in the Dragon-Phoenix Palace; Chen Zhou couldn't grasp why Yang Kai would hide his existence and let Sun Yu take the spotlight.

Yang Kai appeared somewhat embarrassed. "Mainly because at that time I had just become the leader of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—you should have heard about it. The Sacred Land was beset by troubles, a mess I hadn't cleared up, and I had no energy to deal with other matters. Also, strictly speaking I'm not from the Dragon-Phoenix Palace; if I told you I had seized its inheritance, who knows what you might think—perhaps it would stir trouble."

"This was my fault, not Sun Yu's. I asked him to help me hide it—I'm sorry, everyone."

Yang Kai spoke earnestly and laid out the whole story.

Chen Zhou and Xiao Ling exchanged looks, their expressions complex.

After a long moment, Chen Zhou laughed. "Saint Lord Yang being honest now isn't too late. I'm just puzzled: how were you able to open the Dragon Emperor's inheritance? Is there some other reason?"

"Because I cultivated the Dual Cultivation Technique."

Chen Zhou's eyes suddenly brightened.

Yang Kai briefly recounted what had happened in the inheritance cavern back then. The people of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace listened, each of them showing intense excitement.

"It's the inheritance left behind by the Dragon Emperor and the Phoenix Empress! No wonder Saint Lord Yang could break the Dragon Valley's seal—now it all makes sense!" Chen Zhou waved his arms in excitement. "So Saint Lord Yang isn't really an outsider."

"Indeed, strictly speaking, Saint Lord Yang should be counted as one of our Dragon-Phoenix Palace!" Xiao Ling was equally thrilled.

Yang Kai's fostering of amicable ties between the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and the Dragon-Phoenix Palace was likely because of this connection; in that moment Chen Zhou and Xiao Ling finally understood everything.

"By the way, the Phoenix Empress?" Chen Zhou suddenly remembered. "Since Saint Lord Yang has cultivated the Dual Cultivation Technique, there must be a Phoenix Empress! Where is she? Why have I never seen her?"

"She is no longer on the Tongxuan Continent," Yang Kai's expression darkened. "She went to the starry sky."

"The starry sky..." Chen Zhou was stunned into silence.

"I'm going to find her. I don't know when I'll return, so I want to take the Phoenix Empress's inheritance from the Phoenix Nest with me, so that when I find her I can hand it to her."

"Take it away?" Chen Zhou was surprised. "Can that inheritance be taken?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "I'm not sure. I'll go try... of course, if Palace Master agrees."

"That's no problem, though it's difficult. That inheritance has been hidden in the Phoenix Nest for thousands of years; no one knows what form it takes... Do your best."

"Thank you." Yang Kai answered solemnly.

Once it was confirmed that Yang Kai was the true Dragon Emperor's successor, Chen Zhou and Xiao Ling's attitudes abruptly became extremely respectful. Yang Kai requested they not blame Sun Yu; they promised they would not hold it against him. For the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, as long as the Dragon Emperor's identity had an inheritor standing with the sect, it mattered little who it was.

Moreover, Yang Kai's status as the Dragon Emperor's successor had been decided long ago.

They also vowed that although Sun Yu was not the true Dragon Emperor, he would not be mistreated in the future; the sect's resources and manpower would continue to be invested in him.

Sun Yu's current aptitude already far exceeded that of ordinary people and merited focused cultivation.

More than a month later, the group arrived at the Dragon-Phoenix Palace.

The entire Dragon-Phoenix Palace rose to greet them.

Sun Yu had long been informed; he led a group outside the palace to congratulate Chen Zhou and welcome Yang Kai.

Chen Zhou hosted a feast; the sect drank and celebrated.

After several rounds, Yang Kai pulled Sun Yu aside and told him the whole story.

Sun Yu felt a mixture of relief and anxiety. "Senior Yang, this puts my mind at ease, but won't the Palace Master hold a grudge against me?"

"How could that be?" Yang Kai smiled. "Train well. Even if you're not the Dragon Emperor, you're the sect's hope for the future. The Palace Master won't mistreat you."

"Really?"

Yang Kai nodded.

Sun Yu laughed with unrestrained relief, the burden he'd carried for so long finally lifted. Previously, the false title had hung over him like an invisible weight, leaving him uneasy every day lest some flaw be discovered; now it was gone, and he could straighten his back and hold his head high.
