## Chapter 924 — Wait and See

Outside the Nine Peaks, Yang Kai stood with an arm around each of two identical beauties, while the little senior sister with her face veiled stood nearby.

The Sacred Land disciples tasked with guarding this area nearly had their eyes pop out, their faces full of admiration and envy. They thought to themselves: the Saint Lord truly is the Saint Lord—his methods are truly extraordinary. To have even conquered such a pair of lovely sisters… he is indeed a paragon among men.

“That's enough already, what are you two doing?” Yang Kai nearly gasped from being squeezed; the astonishing softness at his chest sent his mind reeling, and he couldn't resist slipping a hand around one of the women's waists.

The two sisters finally released him and glared at him through gritted teeth.

“What’s the matter?” Yang Kai asked warily. “You came to me of your own accord—I'm not the one trying to take advantage of you.”

“Still the same, always annoying.” The alluring woman snorted lightly. “We’ve been worrying about your safety all these years, only to find out you’ve become some Saint Lord here—what a relief to learn we were unnecessarily fretting.”

“You worried about me?” Yang Kai looked at them in astonishment. “I’m truly honored.”

“It wasn’t me… Mei’er kept bringing you up.” The woman blushed and blurted out a denial.

“Sister did.”

"I didn't.”

“Alright, alright, stop bickering the moment you meet—let’s go inside and talk.” Xia Ningshang, having recovered her composure, interjected from the side.

Yang Kai finally grinned and waved at the sisters. “Come with me. Once you’re here, don’t act like strangers.”

“I wouldn’t.” The elder sister sniffed, took her sister’s hand, and together with Xia Ningshang they led the way into the Nine Peaks.

Yang Kai shook his head with an amused smile, watching their retreating figures, his expression gradually turning serious.

The two sisters were none other than the Hu Family sisters of the Blood Battle Gang—Hu Jiao'er and Hu Mei'er.

Because Yang Kai had spent this time investigating news from Zhongdu, when the Great Elder reported that a pair of twins had come seeking him, the image of the Hu sisters immediately sprang to mind.

The Great Elder's subsequent words confirmed his suspicion.

Years ago in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, Yang Kai and Su Yan received the final inheritance—the legacy of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace.

The Hu sisters had also been fortunate; they obtained a set of the Consonant Spirit Technique. After cultivating it, their life breaths and fluctuations of power could perfectly mirror one another.

Their appearance here meant the Zhongdu side and the Tongxuan Continent had indeed connected, and something worrying may have occurred.

“Saint Lord… those two young ladies…” Xu Hui stammered at the side, wanting to inquire about the twins’ background and their relation to Yang Kai but feeling he might be overly nosy.

“It’s not what you think!” Yang Kai shot him a sidelong glance.

“Understood.” Xu Hui hurriedly nodded.

Inside the Nine Peaks, the sisters walked while inspecting the surroundings, continually exclaiming in amazement. Even on the Tongxuan Continent, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land ranked among the top forces; the Nine Peaks were scenic and rich with Spiritual Qi in a way Zhongdu could not match.

Coming here opened their eyes completely; the sisters were like country girls in a bustling metropolis, overwhelmed by the sights.

In the Saint Lord’s courtyard, Xia Ningshang arranged seats for the sisters. Yang Kai personally poured them tea, while An Ling'er brought a plate of rare spirit fruits and attended them courteously.

The Hu sisters looked long overdue for rest; their faces were weary and their strength had been largely drained. The aroma of the spirit fruits made their fingers itch with appetite.

Hu Jiao'er made no pretense—she grabbed two fruits, handed one to Hu Mei'er, and bit into hers with big, greedy mouthfuls.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang sat with them while they rested.

After devouring several spirit fruits, the two seemed to recover. Yang Kai then asked, “You both look weary from travel. Have you been on the road for long?”

The Hu sisters nodded together. “About a little over three months.”

Yang Kai inhaled lightly. “You’ve worked hard.”

The sisters were now at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm; traveling straight for three months would indeed drain a lot of strength, so their exhaustion was understandable.

“Yang Kai, you must return to Zhongdu at once—something may have happened there.” Hu Jiao'er suddenly frowned and spoke sharply, her expression anxious.

“I know.” Yang Kai bowed his head slightly.

“You know?” The Hu sisters stared at him in surprise.

“To be honest, things have happened here recently too. I’ve been probing for a way back but couldn’t find it. Since you came today, explain in detail how you arrived here.”

The Hu sisters exchanged a glance. Hu Jiao'er said, “Do you still remember where the Inheritance Celestial Cave opened? That was at a mine owned by my Hu Family.”

“Of course I remember.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Around three or four months ago, strange phenomena began appearing there.”

Listening to Hu Jiao'er’s account, Yang Kai finally understood why the sisters had come to the Tongxuan Continent and why they’d traveled so far to find the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

A few months earlier, the site where the Inheritance Celestial Cave had shown itself suddenly developed a pitch-black hole. The Hu family received word from their subordinates below and went to investigate together.

In the current Blood Battle Gang—and across the land—the Hu sisters’ strength was considered top-tier.

Confident in their abilities, the Hu sisters fearlessly entered that pitch-black opening to investigate.

Since an Inheritance Celestial Cave had appeared there before, they mistakenly assumed the hole was similar, not knowing it was the entrance to a Void Passage leading to the Tongxuan Continent.

Before they realized it, they had arrived on the Tongxuan Continent.

The two sisters scouted the area for two days and found that this world was completely different from what they had imagined. There were actually many traces of cultivator activity here, and among those cultivators were quite a few experts whose depths even they could not discern.

At that moment, they understood in their hearts that they had come to an extraordinary place.

Preparing to retrace their steps back to the Blood Battle Gang, they were horrified to find the entry they had used blocked by cultivators from a certain force.

That force produced expert after expert; the sisters, isolated and outmatched, couldn't approach—the slightest advance drove them back with intimidation and threats.

With no choice, the two lingered nearby, hoping for an opportunity to return.

But luck did not favor them.

At that point they thought of Yang Kai, who had left Zhongdu ten years ago. As a last resort, they asked around about him, wondering whether he might be in this world and, if so, whether he could help them return.

They did not expect much—yet their inquiries quickly bore fruit.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s reputation was unrivaled in the world, and the name of its Saint Lord, Yang Kai, was widely known.

After inquiring, they discovered the Saint Lord’s age and appearance matched the man they knew, so they hurried to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Their excited, effusive behavior when meeting Yang Kai stemmed from this: they had finally found the very man who had weighed on their minds for months, and the emotional burden dropped away, leaving them uncharacteristically flustered.

“I never thought you truly were the Saint Lord here. This is better—since you govern a Sacred Land, you must be able to negotiate with that force so they won’t harm the Blood Battle Gang or those in Zhongdu, right?” Hu Jiao'er asked earnestly, placing all hope on Yang Kai.

“Do you remember the route? What force drove you away?”

“We don’t remember the exact route…” Hu Jiao'er shook her head slowly. “This place is vast. But local cultivators said the force might be called the Xiaoyao Divine Cult.”

“The Xiaoyao Divine Cult?” Yang Kai frowned, feeling he had heard the name before.

“That place isn't close,” An Ling'er interjected, having listened. “These two likely went a roundabout way—otherwise they could have reached our Sacred Land within two months.”

“You know of that force?” Yang Kai turned his gaze to her.

An Ling'er smiled with pursed lips. “The Saintess studies many things, including the strengths and distribution of forces across the land. The Xiaoyao Divine Cult isn't weak. It has several Saint Realm masters; the strongest among them should be at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.”

“That would put them on par with our Sacred Land!”

“In reputation and prestige they can’t compare to our current Sacred Land, but they are not to be underestimated.” An Ling'er nodded with a smile.

Hearing this, the Hu sisters’ faces grew grave.

From their perspective the Nine Heavens Sacred Land already seemed formidable, yet it could only stand toe-to-toe with the Xiaoyao Divine Cult, and they weren't sure whether this place’s strength could resolve the crisis in Zhongdu.

“Then it depends on whether they can be reasonable. If they are, I’ll treat them well. If not…”

“What will you do then?”

“Wait and see!” Yang Kai grinned, a cold light blazing in his eyes like a sword that pierced the soul.

The Hu sisters’ beautiful eyes brightened, reflecting an extraordinary sheen.

This man was as forceful as ever!

Anyone who dared belittle or oppose him would pay a truly terrible price.

The sisters relaxed instantly, inwardly reassured that with Yang Kai taking action there would be no further need to fret about their sect.

A Divine Sense pulse spread from Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, and moments later the hall’s outer doors rustled as robes and banners swept by.

The Sacred Land’s six elders and the four commanders of the Ancient Demon Clan all appeared together.

“Saint Lord.”

“My lord!”

Everyone saluted in turn, looking at Yang Kai with solemn faces. They didn’t know why he had summoned all the high-ranking elders, but they sensed an unusual aura in the air.

Feeling the overwhelming presence of the ten who had arrived, the Hu sisters dared not draw a breath.

In Zhongdu they had been among the top: together they were nearly invincible, but here they were horrified to discover none of those present were opponents they could withstand.

Their hearts trembled with shock, yet they were stirred by the strength Yang Kai wielded in his hands.
