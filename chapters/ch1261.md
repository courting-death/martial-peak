## Chapter 1261 — Closed Cultivation

Strangely enough, perhaps because the Golden Blood took root and sprouted, the Blood Sword Grass showed no hostility toward Yang Kai; even when he walked through them, they didn't react in the slightest.

But anyone else who entered that place would be torn limb from limb in a frenzied dance of blades, their bodies cut to nothing; those pale golden leaves sharp as knives gave off a cold radiance that sent chills down the spine.

Yang Yan was equal parts astonished and delighted by this discovery, and at once began arranging things around the Blood Sword Grass, preparing to turn the area into a forbidden ground — she even considered using the Blood Sword Grass to form a massive trap.

Even a cultivator of the Origin Returning Realm who blundered into such a patch of Blood Sword Grass would scarcely escape without losing skin, if not life.

Three days after Yang Kai's return, Qian Tong personally led Wei Guchang and Xuan'er to Dragon Lair Mountain; once they confirmed Yang Kai had indeed come back safely, all three felt considerably relieved.

Qian Tong also learned from Wei Guchang that in the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai had saved both him and Xuan'er; regardless of whether Qian Tong wished to befriend Yang Kai, that one rescue alone left him deeply grateful.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er were Yingyue Hall's most gifted disciples; had they perished in the Flowing Flame Sandland, the loss would have been incalculable.

They were tactful enough not to press Yang Kai why he had been absent from the Flowing Flame Sandland for so long, but they all suspected he had secured some other opportunity; as a result, Qian Tong's opinion of Yang Kai only grew warmer, and he treated him with the familiarity of an elder.

Moreover, Dragon Lair Mountain and Yingyue Hall were now closely cooperating; Yang Yan and the others purchased large quantities of materials from Yingyue Hall, which had profited handsomely — for many reasons, Qian Tong had come to regard Dragon Lair Mountain as a partner and ally.

In the course of their conversation, Yang Kai learned from them about the gains and losses each great power suffered when the Flowing Flame Sandland opened.

The losses were indeed severe: over ten thousand cultivators entered the Flowing Flame Sandland, but fewer than seventy percent returned safely; fully thirty to forty percent of each power's elite disciples perished — a truly heavy toll.

Though such losses saddened every faction, the spoils those survivors brought back more than made up for the human cost; nearly everyone gained something to varying degrees, and the sect disciples who returned with Red Candle Fruit meat received generous rewards from their sects.

The appearance of Red Candle Fruit meat also stirred a frenzy across Dark Star; several pill-refining masters from the Medicine Pill Sect ran between powers trying to buy the fruit with vast sums, and when that failed, they offered to refine pills for the holders.

But no one trusted another power enough to hand over such a heaven-defying spirit fruit, not even to the Medicine Pill Sect, so after half a year of fruitless pleading, the pill masters returned in frustration.

This was perhaps the first time powers on Dark Star had so firmly refused to show face to the Medicine Pill Sect; six months earlier the matter had caused considerable uproar.

Yingyue Hall even had several traitors who attempted to steal the Red Candle Fruit meat, but they were exposed and annihilated on the spot.

Other sects fared similarly, and after half a year the uproar over the Red Candle Fruit meat gradually subsided; however, how each great sect handled the fruit remained completely undisclosed.

After discussing these matters, Yang Kai took the opportunity to ask Qian Tong many questions about training in the Saint King Realm. Qian Tong generously shared his cultivation insights; Yang Kai, Wei Guchang, Xuan'er and the others listened attentively and benefited greatly.

Half a day later, Qian Tong and the others took their leave.

Before departing, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er told Yang Kai that they would now seclude themselves to break through into the Origin Returning Realm; having grown in the Flowing Flame Sandland, this was the best time to attempt the leap.

Yang Kai knew well that if they hadn't been waiting for word of him, they would have started seclusion long ago — it was uncertainty over his fate that had delayed them and caused them to miss the prime opportunity.

He understood this fully and didn't point it out.

Before leaving, Xuan'er leaned in mysteriously and whispered, "Senior Brother Yang, Daiyuan has sent me word many times over these months asking after you; it's a pity you never showed up, so I couldn't tell her for sure — now that you've returned safely, Daiyuan will surely be much relieved."

"Daiyuan…" Yang Kai paused, a grotesque face flashing through his mind, and his expression turned extremely odd.

Why would she care so much? Though they hadn't known each other long, Yang Kai felt Daiyuan's personality made it unlikely she'd worry for no reason; besides, when they parted on the Fourth Layer, she had said something rather intriguing.

She had mentioned that she intended to come and thank him — clearly she hadn't spoken idly.

While Yang Kai brooded, Wei Guchang let out a low chuckle, evidently misunderstanding and thinking something had occurred between Yang Kai and Daiyuan in the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Yang Kai couldn't be bothered to explain.

Even if there had been nothing between him and Daiyuan, and even if she were a beauty of rare grace, Yang Kai would not be moved; he had seen countless beauties, and since entering the Star Domain his heart had been fixed on two other ladies — he had no mind to flirt.

Xuan'er bit her lip and murmured, "Actually, Daiyuan isn't the sort of person you think she is!"

Having said that cryptic line, Xuan'er hurried to catch up with Wei Guchang and left with him.

Yang Kai was left standing there confused; he had no idea what Xuan'er meant. After shaking his head, he returned to his stone chamber and spent a month refining every herb he could into pills, then summoned Yang Yan and Wu Yi to inform them he would seclude himself for a time and asked that they not disturb him unless something serious occurred — they could manage Dragon Lair Mountain themselves.

Naturally those pills were for them to manage as they saw fit; the quantity was enormous and most of them were to aid cultivation — with those pills, everyone's strength would rise rapidly.

Yang Yan and Wu Yi naturally agreed.

Yang Kai then entered his stone abode and began his period of seclusion.

He had many tasks: to see whether the Flowing Flame Fireblaze could enhance his Divine Sense Fire, to refine the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl, to comprehend the Demon Blood Threads technique, and to consolidate his newly acquired Second Stage of the Saint King Realm — none of these could be completed in a day or two.

However, if he wanted to refine the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl, Yang Kai would first have to finish refining that artifact furnace.

Yang Yan's advice was sound: sharpen the axe before chopping wood — once he thoroughly refined the Void King-Grade furnace, he would save much time refining the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl; moreover, the furnace had given birth to an Artifact Spirit that could serve as an offensive Secret Treasure.

Having carefully listed what he needed to accomplish, Yang Kai set to work.

His first task was to refine the artifact furnace.

Although he had subdued the Artifact Spirit in the Earth-Lung Fire Pool, subduing an Artifact Spirit and refining a furnace were different matters; yet the subdued spirit aided him greatly, enabling faster and more effective refinement.

He removed the furnace and placed it before him, closed his eyes, and let Saint Yuan surge forth, transforming into Demonic Flame to wrap the furnace and let his aura permeate it.

Time flowed by bit by bit — in cultivation, there was no sense of years. In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.

From the moment he entered the stone abode, Yang Kai didn't come out; no one knew what he was doing inside.

Even Chang Qi and Hao An, who had surged to the Origin Returning Realm from within the chamber and increased their cultivation, did not see Yang Kai himself; aided by Origin Condensing Pills and with the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense and Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree in the chamber, they broke through to the Origin Returning Realm within half a month and came out in succession.

After breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm, Yingyue Hall had even sent over some cultivation manuals pertaining to that realm, leaving Chang Qi and Hao An overjoyed.

Both came from minor clans and had never received such precious materials before; Qian Tong advanced them for Yang Kai's sake, and the two were sincerely grateful. They then entered their pavilion to seclude themselves and grasp the forces only Origin Returning Realm cultivators could perceive.

Over the half year, Dragon Lair Mountain ran in perfect order: Wu Yi handled internal affairs and dealings with Yingyue Hall, Yang Yan oversaw the deployment of sealing arrays, and Dragon Lair Mountain's defenses rose a level; the former Haike Family cultivators buried themselves in diligent cultivation.

Were it not for Yang Yan needing to use forging and array formation to comprehend much knowledge in her mind, Dragon Lair Mountain would have required no further arrangements in its current state.

During this half year, Yang Kai also consolidated his realm. After refining the Profound Yin Moon Water, his cultivation rose to the pinnacle of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm; now stabilized, with the right opportunity and assistance he could press on to the Third Stage.

The refining furnace had been completely absorbed into his body; after assimilating it, the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit could freely enter and exit Yang Kai's body, no longer confined to perching on his shoulder.

This little thing and the Stone Puppet seemed naturally at odds; when they met they often came to blows.

Yang Kai discovered the Stone Puppet's combat strength was not to be underestimated: its natural armor resisted the Artifact Spirit's fiery burns; though it looked clumsy and heavy, once in battle its speed was astonishing. Were it not for the Artifact Spirit's ability to fly, the Stone Puppet would not be at a disadvantage — regardless, each clash between them ended in a draw, neither able to best the other.
