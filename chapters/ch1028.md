## Chapter 1028 — Departure

No one expected that someone like Yang Kai would have studied the mysteries of space; spatial power has always been an extremely esoteric domain, not only difficult to comprehend but exceedingly hard to breakthrough—warriors versed in spatial mysteries are extraordinarily rare.

Even across the entire Star Void, those proficient in spatial secrets are as scarce as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

A powerhouse like the Ghost Ancestor had researched for a thousand years and produced little of consequence; the Space Arrays he fashioned were essentially useless.

“Brother…” Shen Tu pressed his dry lips together and murmured, “are you really from a lower‑ranked continent? You wouldn’t have been playing dumb all this time, would you?”

He voiced what everyone else had been thinking; nearly all of them had entertained the notion that Yang Kai’s origins were extraordinary and that he’d been putting on an act these past days.

Yang Kai smiled: “If I weren’t from a lower‑ranked continent, I wouldn’t be ignorant of the Star Void’s common knowledge.”

Shen Tu thought the matter over carefully and slightly nodded. “That’s true.”

Since meeting Yang Kai, he had repeatedly asked him basic, common‑sense questions; if all of that were an act, it would be going too far.

“But you really are surprising…” Shen Tu could only laugh wryly. “Why are you telling us this now?”

“Because I need your cooperation to leave.” Yang Kai’s expression grew serious. “I can tear open space and let you enter the spatial turbulence to seek a way out, but the rifts I tear are not the same as long‑formed Void Passages. A Void Passage is stable; it connects two points of space so one can freely shuttle between them. The tears I make are unstable.”

Everyone’s expressions shifted; they suddenly realized the matter was not as simple as they had thought. The path out seemed strewn with thorns.

“I need you to promise me you won’t use any power in there!” Yang Kai surveyed them solemnly, then fixed his gaze on the Ghost Ancestor. “That includes you, Elder. If you employ power, you may disturb the turbulence and make it more chaotic. We could easily be flung into unknown spatial crevices; if we can’t confirm our position, even I won’t be able to get us out!”

The Ghost Ancestor grinned and nodded. “Fine. I won’t use my power.”

“Do you all understand?” Yang Kai asked the others.

Everyone nodded in unison.

“That’s all. Just follow me and you’ll be fine.” Yang Kai thought through his warnings one more time and said, “If you’re ready, let’s go.”

Saying that, he reached out and tore. A rift opened in the void, as if pulled apart by an invisible hand, several zhang across, the interior pitch black without a hint of light. Violent currents of void power slammed and tore within, forming a marshlike, terrifying region—peculiar beyond imagination.

The Ghost Ancestor’s expression grew grave as he peered deep into the spatial fissure; the others grew even more tense.

Yang Kai held a luminous stone he had pried from the cave wall in his hand and, without a word, slipped inside.

The Ghost Ancestor’s eyes flickered; he didn’t hurry after Yang Kai but simply tossed Shen Tu in.

Bi Ya followed right after Shen Tu, and only then did Ghost Ancestor stroll in unhurriedly, forcing Yue Xi and her two disciples to be squeezed in at the very end.

Once the seven of them had all entered, the torn rift snapped shut and vanished.

Around them was cold darkness, the only light coming from the strange stone in Yang Kai’s hand, guiding their way.

They dared not take a misstep, each walking on eggshells through the spatial turbulence, glancing left and right with horror on their faces.

None of them had experienced anything like this, nor had they imagined they would one day walk within a spatial rift.

The turbulence around them was chaotic and savage, like a monstrous maw ready to devour them; the currents resembled the most treacherous marshes, filled with muck‑traps—one slip could pull them in and exile them to the world’s end.

Their hearts pounded fiercely in each chest.

They moved forward in a mix of wonder and dread, watching the surroundings with bated breath.

What reassured them was that where Yang Kai passed, the chaotic spatial force seemed soothed, and the treacherous muck solidified into firm ground, making it safer to tread.

Each person keenly sensed that Yang Kai’s vigor resonated oddly with the turbulence, discerning its patterns; this is why he could find a way through.

They held their breath and followed in single file, stepping where the preceding person had stepped.

Suddenly a short exclamation sounded and Yang Kai stopped, turning back to ask, “What is it?”

“Nothing…” He Miao patted her chest apologetically. “Sorry, I thought I had fallen.”

Beside her foot, the space had fractured inch by inch like a shattered mirror, giving a dizzying illusion of plunging into an abyss.

Yang Kai nodded and said nothing further, continuing to lead.

“Girl, stop making a fuss; you scared this old man half to death!” the Ghost Ancestor called back with a grin—his eerie smile made He Miao’s pale face even worse.

As he walked ahead, Yang Kai stopped again and tore another rift through the spatial barrier.

He leapt through.

The others followed closely.

Clean air filled their nostrils and each felt as if they’d returned from the gates of death, sweating heavily. After looking around, Shen Tu suddenly said strangely, “Yang Kai, we don’t seem to have gone very far!”

He spoke and glanced downward.

Directly beneath their feet was a burned mountain peak, bare and scorched, and on the flat waist of the mountain there were several figures—clearly Lü Guichen and Purple Star’s warriors.

Those below had also noticed this side and were pointing toward them in confusion.

“Indeed, not far—only a thousand li.” Yang Kai nodded and explained, “This time was just to let you get used to moving within the turbulence. The real task comes next.”

He pointed to the Seven‑Colored Sky. “We have to pierce through that sky and break the sealing field of the Chaos region.”

“Understood!” Shen Tu nodded.

“Continue!” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “I can tear a few more times.”

He sensed the trace of his previously left Divine Sense thread, confirmed its position, and tore space once more.

The group flowed through. He Miao glanced down softly and said, “Master, Lü Guichen and the others seem to be heading this way.”

“Ignore them and keep up!” Yue Xi urged.

“Oh.”

“Lü Guichen, wait here and die!” Yue Xi sneered lightly as she casually glanced below, being the last to enter.

A moment later, Lü Guichen, who had arrived here with a Star Shuttle, wandered about horrified, unable to see anyone; he suddenly realized he had been abandoned and his face turned pale.

Those the Ghost Ancestor had summoned were clearly connected to Yang Kai, while the only ones not summoned were Purple Star’s people.

He felt a touch of schadenfreude, thinking Yue Xi and the others were about to die, unaware that it was actually a route to survival.

Instead he and his three or four lackeys would be left behind forever.

His expression shifted and he roared in fury.

Beneath the mottled seven‑colored sky, the domain fields from the stars of the Chaos Abyss intersected, making this expanse of thousands upon ten thousands of li even stranger and more unfathomable than the space crevices.

A rift suddenly opened in one place and Yang Kai stepped out, closing his eyes to sense for a moment, his heart settling.

The Divine Sense thread he had left earlier was not far off; although slightly off course, it would do. If he followed it, he was confident he could reach the Chaos Abyss.

Once they reached the Chaos Abyss, they would truly be free.

One after another figures appeared behind him; when everyone saw the scene, they all marveled, for all around were seven‑colored hues, dazzling and extraordinarily beautiful.

But they soon discovered that their Divine Sense could not extend here; it would be affected by the chaotic domain fields and become lost, with no chance even to retract it.

The Ghost Ancestor lightly nodded. “Good, you truly have the ability to leave. I did not misplace my trust in you.”

He instantly recognized that this place was above some location of the Floating Continent he had never reached, and his faith in Yang Kai swelled as if his two‑thousand‑year wish was about to be fulfilled—his expression, less sinister than before, softened into a hopeful smile.

Yang Kai gave him a sidelong glance and a faint smile.

The human‑face mark on his arm gave off a chillier fluctuation than before.

He knew the Ghost Ancestor was wary of him, fearful he might abandon them.

If they were truly left behind, the Ghost Ancestor might not be certain he could return to the Floating Continent.

Yang Kai did harbor such thoughts, but he dared not act rashly under the Ghost Ancestor’s eyes; he lacked the confidence to do anything under such scrutiny, so he behaved properly.

He again located the position of the Divine Sense thread ahead and tore space.

Each shift covered a thousand li. Yang Kai led the other six through the spatial turbulence, everything proceeding smoothly as they drew ever closer to the Chaos Abyss.

After tearing space five times in all and exiting the turbulence, Yang Kai immediately sat cross‑legged to catch his breath and told them, “Wait a moment; I need to recover.”

Each use of this method is a tremendous drain; Yang Kai could not continue indefinitely. The power in his Sea of Consciousness had already been more than halved and he had to replenish it to avoid being unable to handle sudden emergencies.
