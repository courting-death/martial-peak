## Chapter 268 — So It Is My Cousin

“What are you doing?” Dong Qinghan smiled with the demeanor of a cousin as he looked at Yang Kai, but was instantly left in a state of embarrassment by the girl’s outburst, his image completely ruined.

“He… he… it’s him!” The girl pointed at Yang Kai with a slender finger like a white onion, her face filled with shock.

Dong Qinghan finally managed to brush off the tea leaves on his head and frowned, “What do you mean it’s him? Be clear.”

“The person I met outside the valley! The bad guy who grabbed me and threw me out!” The girl hurriedly explained.

Dong Qinghan was taken aback, turning to look at Yang Kai, then at the girl, a hint of astonishment flashing across his chubby face.

What a coincidence…

Yang Kai was also puzzled; he hadn’t expected this mischievous girl to appear here. This was the Dong Family’s territory, and since she could sit at the same table as Dong Qinghan, her status must be quite high. Could it be…

A thought crossed his mind, and Yang Kai began to have some guesses.

“You dare to appear in front of me!” The girl recalled her encounter that day and felt furious. With Dong Qinghan and the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians backing her, she immediately regained her confidence, gritting her silver teeth as she rushed to Yang Kai, raising her chin proudly and mimicking someone’s expression, she said with a strange tone, “Hehe, what’s this saying… Heaven has a path you don’t walk, hell has no door and you barged in, you’re doomed!”

Though she said this, there was no trace of anger or killing intent on her face; instead, she looked at Yang Kai with great interest.

Yang Kai grinned, “Is this how you treat your savior?”

As he spoke, he playfully slapped her on the head.

The girl squinted her big eyes. Suddenly shrinking back, she quickly darted behind Dong Qinghan like a rabbit, glaring at Yang Kai with gritted teeth, her expression one of false bravado.

“Do not be presumptuous!” Dong Qinghan scolded with a stern face.

The girl immediately straightened her back and shouted at Yang Kai, “You don’t be presumptuous!”

“I’m talking to you!” Dong Qinghan shot her a glare.

“Ah?” The girl was instantly stunned.

“No matter what, he saved your life. Can’t you at least say thank you? You’re so grown up, yet you have no manners, what kind of behavior is this!” Dong Qinghan reprimanded with an air of authority.

“I don’t want to. If it weren’t for him throwing me back that day, I could have escaped into Yao Wang Valley!” The girl stomped her foot and made a face at Dong Qinghan.

“Unruly! Get out!” Dong Qinghan slammed the table in anger.

The girl pouted, her eyes immediately turning red, and she angrily stormed out.

Before leaving, she shot Yang Kai a fierce glare.

After the girl left, Dong Qinghan could only shake his head with a wry smile and exchanged a glance with the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians. The two immediately released their Divine Sense, nodding to Dong Qinghan after a moment.

“Sit down.” Dong Qinghan gestured.

Yang Kai plopped down, poured himself a cup of tea, and frowned as he asked, “That girl just now…”

“Yan’er. You’ve met before.” 

Yang Kai couldn’t help but smile wryly; if that was the case, she and he truly were cousins.

He hadn’t expected her casual call that day to turn out to be true.

Dong Qingyan, Yang Kai had some impression of her. However, the only time they had met was ten years ago when she was still a little girl running around behind Dong Qinghan. After ten years, how could Yang Kai recognize her?

“Girls change a lot as they grow up…” Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly; not only had he not recognized her, but she probably wouldn’t recognize him either. Who remembers so much from childhood?

“Yan’er said she was saved by a boy about her age a few days ago. I didn’t expect that person to be you.” Dong Qinghan sighed, marveling at how coincidental life could be.

“An encounter!” Yang Kai nodded slightly, not taking credit for it. Not to mention that he hadn’t exerted much effort that day, saving her was only natural since she was his cousin.

As they spoke, Dong Qingyan returned, sneaking over quietly. She held a piece of ancient jade in her hand, which emitted faint energy fluctuations, masking all her aura.

This concealment was thorough; even a master in the Divine Roaming Realm using Divine Sense wouldn’t be able to detect it.

Before long, Dong Qingyan reached the door like a cat, tilting her little ear to listen.

Yang Kai seemed familiar with Dong Qinghan, which naturally piqued her curiosity. Moreover, her brother usually wouldn’t scold her like that; he had even directly sent her away just now.

Dong Qingyan immediately thought that the two must have some secret to discuss, which was why her brother had deliberately sent her away. Hmph… I’ll just have to listen to what you’re talking about.

The voices from inside the room drifted out, and Dong Qingyan bit her red lip, her little face flushed with tension.

Though she was nervous, she was also excited. While at the Dong Family, she had relied on this ancient jade to eavesdrop on many confidential matters, and she was already quite skilled at it.

“What brings you here?” Dong Qinghan asked Yang Kai.

“I came to ask you for a favor.”

“What favor?”

“I need to enter Yao Wang Valley.” Yang Kai got straight to the point, taking a sip from his teacup and looking at Dong Qinghan calmly, “Is there any way?”

“Which peak?” Dong Qinghan’s expression turned serious.

“Dan Sheng Peak!”

Upon hearing this, not only did Dong Qinghan’s eyes narrow, but even the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians standing behind him shot Yang Kai a glance.

Dong Qinghan smiled wryly, “Yao Wang Valley has twelve major peaks, ten of which are the residences of the ten elders, and another is the residence of the valley master. The central main peak is Dan Sheng Peak, which is also a forbidden area of Yao Wang Valley. If you want to enter the other peaks, I can still manage, but Dan Sheng Peak… I truly have the heart but no strength.”

“No way at all?” Yang Kai was somewhat unwilling to give up. He knew the uniqueness of Dan Sheng Peak; otherwise, he wouldn’t have come to find Dong Qinghan.

He couldn’t use the Yang Family’s power right now, but Dong Qinghan was different. He was the son of the Dong Family, the future successor, and naturally could utilize the Dong Family’s connections and resources.

Dong Qinghan furrowed his brows, lightly tapping the table with his fingers. After a moment, he said, “It’s not entirely hopeless.”

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened, “Tell me!”

“In a little over two months, there will be an alchemy conference held here. At that time, alchemists from various sects will come to compete, and in every alchemy conference, the top fifty alchemists can enter Dan Sheng Peak to pay respects to the portrait of Dan Sheng and comprehend the secrets of alchemy. If you can make it into the top fifty, you can rightfully enter Dan Sheng Peak!”

Yang Kai rolled his eyes, “Do I look like an alchemist?”

Dong Qinghan shook his head seriously, “Not at all… But this is the only opportunity to enter Dan Sheng Peak. Aside from this… unless you are an elder of Yao Wang Valley.”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly.

Both methods sounded like a pipe dream; becoming an elder of Yao Wang Valley was clearly impossible, and achieving a top fifty ranking at the alchemy conference was also a far-fetched notion.

Yang Kai hadn’t even dabbled in the path of alchemy; how could he stand out among the alchemists of the world? Those who dared to showcase their skills at the alchemy conference must have profound knowledge in this field.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown.

“Except for Dan Sheng Peak, I can find a way for you to go to the other peaks, and it’s not difficult to enter.” Dong Qinghan also felt a bit embarrassed; this was the first time his cousin had asked him for a favor, yet he couldn’t help him, which made him feel somewhat awkward.

“Not difficult?”

Dong Qinghan smiled slightly, “It’s quite simple. Just find some precious heaven-and-earth treasures and request the elders of Yao Wang Valley to refine them. That way, you can visit the various peaks, but you can only stay for half a day at most. If you stay longer, Yao Wang Valley will have to kick you out. Those elders have quite the temper, and the disciples of Yao Wang Valley are even more arrogant, more so than the young masters of the Eight Great Families in Zhongdu.”

Yang Kai listened and secretly shook his head.

Being allowed to stay for only half a day was definitely not enough time.

“Then, if you’re not in a hurry, just go back for now. I’ll think of other ways to see if there are any opportunities.” Dong Qinghan’s expression turned serious, “I won’t ask what you want to do at Dan Sheng Peak, but one thing is for sure: if anything goes wrong, don’t sell out the Dong Family.”

Hearing his serious tone, Yang Kai grinned, “What do you think I’m going to do?”

“Who knows what you’re up to?” Dong Qinghan said irritably, sighing, “I can only think of a way for you; I can’t guarantee anything.”

“Got it.” Yang Kai nodded.

After bidding farewell to Dong Qinghan, Yang Kai returned to the inn, meditating while pondering how to enter Dan Sheng Peak.

The implications in Dong Qinghan’s words were already quite clear; he didn’t have any good way to send Yang Kai to Dan Sheng Peak, so he couldn’t place his hopes on him.

Just as he was deep in thought, there was a knock at the door. Yang Kai frowned and stood up to open it.

Upon seeing who it was, he found the mischievous Dong Qingyan smiling shyly at him, “Hehe!”

The hostility and animosity from earlier had vanished, replaced by warmth and curiosity.

“What brings you here?” Yang Kai asked, looking at her with curiosity.

“So you’re really here.” Dong Qingyan breathed a sigh of relief, peeking into the room, and cleared her throat, “Brother asked me to tell you that he has thought of a way.”

Yang Kai was taken aback, a strange smile slowly appearing on his face as he stepped aside, “Come in and talk.”

Dong Qingyan wasn’t afraid at all; she slipped inside.

Curiously examining everything in the room, Dong Qingyan pouted, “You live in a place like this? So small and messy, I can’t believe you’re… cough cough…”

Dong Qingyan at least knew that Yang Kai’s identity as a young master of the Yang Family shouldn’t be casually mentioned, and quickly swallowed her words.

“Did your brother say he has a way?” Yang Kai asked with a teasing smile.

“Mm.” Dong Qingyan nodded eagerly.

“He told you in person?”

“Of course.” Dong Qingyan’s long eyelashes fluttered slightly.

“Then why didn’t he come to tell me himself?”

“Isn’t it the same that I came?” Dong Qingyan plopped down on the bed, even testing its elasticity, “Brother said that I’m fully responsible for this matter, and he has other important things to attend to, so he has already left Yao Wang Valley. You won’t need to look for him anymore.”
