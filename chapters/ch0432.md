## Chapter 432 — A Little Gift for You

"Young Master Huo, be careful!" Yang Zhao smiled lightly, kindly giving a warning before slowly lifting his foot and stomping down with sudden force.

Suddenly, several strange straight lines bulged on the ground, as if huge earthworms were writhing beneath it. A terrifying energy seeped up from below, causing Huo Xingchen's expression to shift abruptly.

Earth Fiend Dragon Technique! A Heaven-Grade Upper-Level Martial Skill. The moment Yang Zhao wielded it, its extraordinary nature was revealed.

Each of these Earth Fiend Dragons was forged from the souls of Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts, refined and stored within Yang Zhao's body. In battle, they could be flexibly deployed, often catching foes off guard and breaking through defenses.

Currently, Yang Zhao could summon a full seven Earth Fiend Dragons! With this move, he rarely needed to make much effort to defeat opponents within the True Essence Realm.

Huo Xingchen's face grew solemn as he quickly retreated, stepping in a wondrous and profound footwork. With every step he took, an energy lotus bloomed beneath his feet, opening and closing in tandem to block and swallow the Earth Fiend Dragons one by one.

Covering Moon Lotus Step! Also a Heaven-Grade Upper-Level Martial Skill, it was a perfect match against Yang Zhao’s Earth Fiend Dragon Technique, two masters clashing in equal measure.

After retreating seven paces, Huo Xingchen seemed to settle his steps, wiping the sweat from his brow as he smiled wryly. "Second Young Master, must you be so ruthless? After all, we once shared pleasures together. Last time at the Spring Breeze Pleasure Pavilion, you even treated me..."

"Stop talking nonsense!" Yang Zhao rolled his eyes before coldly snorting, "You’re really playing the wolf in sheep’s clothing!"

"What are you saying, Second Young Master? I don't understand. Hehe, since the Second Young Lord wishes to duel, this Young Master is happy to oblige!" As he spoke, differing energies surged from both of Huo Xingchen’s hands.

One hand summoned the wind; the other, thunder.

The winds howled as thunder roared and lightning flashed; the two energies merged to form a giant hand, lunging at Yang Zhao.

Wind and Thunder Force Great Hand Seal!

A Mystery-Grade Lower-Level Martial Skill of the Huo Family! The forces of wind and thunder nurtured and fused with one another, greatly enhancing the power of the strike.

Yang Zhao showed no sign of alarm or evasion. Instead, he wore a serene and composed smile, as if the attack was nothing to worry about.

"Seize him!" As the Wind and Thunder Force Great Hand Seal came crashing down, Yang Zhao calmly issued the command.

Huo Xingchen’s face drastically changed as he protested, "Second Young Master, is this really proper?"

Yang Zhao shrugged with a light laugh. "An evil person will meet an evil person’s retribution."

During their exchange, Yang Zhao’s Blood Servants had already acted.

Though bound to never attack unprovoked, now that Huo Xingchen had launched an offensive against Yang Zhao, they could naturally counterattack.

Yang Zhao had deliberately planned from the start to use his Blood Servants to capture Huo Xingchen. That was why he hadn’t dodged his enemy’s martial skill—single combat was not his intention.

Earlier, Huo Xingchen had stirred chaos in the enemy’s ranks by unscrupulous tactics, and Yang Zhao was now responding with what was almost cheating. It was a calculated counter.

With just a casual wave, the Blood Servants dispersed the wind and thunder energies like smoke dissolving in the clouds.

Even though the technique was a Mystery-Grade Lower-Level Martial Skill, it could not shake the Blood Servants in the slightest.

After shattering the Wind and Thunder Force Great Hand Seal, the Blood Servants wasted no time, opening their hands and lunging to seize Huo Xingchen.

The eldest Young Master looked utterly dismayed, apparently unprepared for Yang Zhao’s shamelessness.

At that moment, two shadowy figures suddenly burst out of nowhere, their heads obscured and faces partly hidden. Dressed in tight black garb, one shielded Huo Xingchen as they retreated, while the other lightly pushed forward a palm, meeting the Blood Servants’ assault head-on.

The Blood Servants Hall expert’s expression turned icy cold as true essence surged wildly within.

With a thunderous crash, the black-clad figure staggered back several paces before regaining balance. The Blood Servants remained steady.

In this brief clash, the disparity in strength was immediately apparent.

Though the Blood Servants held the edge, the two black-clad challengers were no weaklings themselves.

"More reinforcements?" Yang Zhao’s face darkened, caught utterly off guard by the numerous top-tier experts hiding within Yang Kai’s estate.

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu alone had already tied down most of the forces brought by Yang Shen and himself. Just as Qu Gaoyi was about to exhaust his true essence and divine sense, victory nearly assured, these two nearly Blood Servants-level warriors unexpectedly appeared.

Yang Kai's residence boasted the presence of four Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage experts!

Moreover, there were the Qiu Family’s Autumn Rain Hall, the Xiang Family’s contingent, and even the unscrupulous Huo Xingchen.

Though Yang Zhao and Yang Shen rivaled or exceeded these forces in strength, their two Blood Servants were limited by rules and could not attack first, extinguishing any hope of conquest.

Where did Ninth Brother gather so many assistants?

Yang Zhao was nearly green with envy.

"What the hell!" Huo Xingchen dumbfoundedly stared at the two masked black-clad figures, his eyes bulging.

Yang Zhao, though unaware of their identities, knew full well.

Having followed him for so many years, Huo Xingchen would recognize them blindfolded. These rogue-looking fellows were unmistakably his lifelong guardians.

For a moment, both Yang Zhao and Huo Xingchen were frozen in shock.

Qiu Yimeng sat in the grand chair, chuckling as if having hit the jackpot, joyous beyond measure.

Yang Shen’s expression was as dark as coal.

The standoff lasted a while longer before Yang Zhao gritted his teeth and said gravely, "Retreat!"

No chance to take Yang Kai’s estate tonight—why linger? Yang Zhao was decisive.

With a command, the martial artists surrounding Qu Gaoyi leapt out of battle. Qu Gaoyi, bloodied and gasping, did not pursue but stood firm, eyes fixed on the withdrawing enemies.

The warriors brought by Xiang Tianxiao and Autumn Rain Hall quickly separated from the entangled foe.

"Sixth Young Master, just like that?" Qiu Ziru asked with some dissatisfaction.

He was eager to defeat Yang Kai and prove himself. Hearing Yang Zhao order a retreat stunned him.

"What else can we do?" Yang Shen answered bitterly, venting his frustration.

Tonight’s battle cost his forces more severely than Yang Zhao’s, so his mood was naturally sour.

Just as Yang Shen sighed preparing to leave alongside Yang Zhao, a figure suddenly flew in from outside.

A loud voice rang out: "Leaving just like that, Ninth Brother feels a bit guilty. I’ll send Second Brother and Sixth Brother a little gift to take home!"

At the same time, an overwhelming barrage of sword light fell from midair.

A Mystery-Grade Martial Skill of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect—Ten Thousand Swords Return to One!

Among the sword glimmers, bursts of purple eerie light exploded. Mysterious and chilling soul techniques surged forth.

Tiger’s roar and ox’s bellow sounded as beast soul techniques erupted mightily.

Thousands of blood-red, razor-sharp petals drifted down like snowflakes, but each was a deadly weapon.

This vast array of attacks was launched almost simultaneously, enveloping all enemies. The previously calm atmosphere instantly became tense and hostile. Killing intent blazed intensely.

"Young Masters, be careful!" Alarmed cries rang out.

The two Blood Servants took the lead in shielding Yang Zhao and Yang Shen. Experts from the Xiang, Nan, Qiu, and Ye families all rushed to protect their young masters, emitting bursts of martial skill lights and the radiance of treasures to ensure their safety.

The energies of heaven and earth suddenly became chaotic, violent true essence running rampant.

After a while, the earth-shaking commotion gradually subsided.

Among the attackers, six or seven lay fallen; the remainder wore grim expressions.

Yang Zhao cast a cold glance toward the starry sky. Yang Kai stood midair with sword in hand, a faint smile on his face as his tone remained calm and moderate.

"Second Brother, Sixth Brother, good evening. Ninth Brother just returned from an outing; I apologize for the poor reception. Between brothers, I trust this is nothing to fuss about."

Yang Zhao’s face twitched slightly. Yang Shen screamed hoarsely, "Ninth Brother, you really went out?"

Earlier, Huo Xingchen and Qiu Yimeng had claimed Yang Kai was not at home. Yang Zhao had doubted it, thinking their young master was hiding in fear. Now, witnessing him return from outside, they could only believe it.

"Indeed." Yang Kai nodded. "The night is long. I strolled by Third Brother’s residence. I never imagined you would come tonight. Had I known, I would have stayed to properly entertain you."

"Third Brother’s residence..." Yang Zhao’s eyes narrowed sharply, unexpectedly admiring this Ninth Brother’s boldness.

Drawing a deep breath, Yang Zhao asked, "How is Third Brother’s situation?"

"Third Brother lost," Yang Kai slowly shook his head. "Fifth Brother and Seventh Brother teamed up, and Third Brother couldn’t hold out."

"That outcome is expected. But you, younger brother, have greatly exceeded my expectations—quietly gathering so many allies. I commend you."

"Second Brother flatters me." Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"So, who took Third Brother’s command flag and men?"

Hearing this, Yang Shen also peered over with interest.

"The news will come tomorrow." Yang Kai chuckled but withheld the truth.

Yang Zhao did not press further. He nodded lightly and smiled, "In that case, Second Brother will take his leave. Younger Brother Kai, we shall meet again. Next time, Second Brother will be fully prepared. I hope you won’t disappoint."

"I will try my best."

"Let’s go!" Yang Zhao commanded sharply, swiftly leading his forces in retreat.

Before leaving, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng glanced nervously at Yang Kai. The impression he left at Taifang Mountain was profound. Though they raged for revenge, seeing Yang Kai in person stirred unease.

With Yang Zhao gone, Yang Shen was also unwilling to linger. They collected their comrades’ corpses and soon vanished into the night.

The succession war’s first night of battle thus drew to a close.

At Fengshen Hall, the eight Supreme Elders, all beyond the Divine Roaming Realm stage and belonging to various great families, slowly opened their eyes and retracted their divine senses. Within their clouded gazes arose a hint of admiration.

At their level of strength and years, few things could sway their hearts, yet tonight, someone had accomplished just that.
