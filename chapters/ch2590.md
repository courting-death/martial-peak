## Chapter 2590 — It Actually Has a Master

Under the punch of that burly Saint Envoy, the sword light of Yang Kai’s Myriad Sword shattered, and even his whole body was swept up by the fierce force of the punch, leaving him unsteady on his feet.

“Overestimating yourself!” the burly Saint Envoy snorted coldly, killing intent flashing in his eyes. He threw another punch, simple and direct, without the slightest flourish—a strike that had returned to its most primal form.

If the burly Saint Envoy still harbored thoughts of subduing the Stone Spirit Race—unwilling to fight them to the death unless absolutely necessary—he felt no such restraint toward Yang Kai. He was just a mere human; what did it matter if he killed him?

The fist had not yet landed, but the force of it was already howling toward Yang Kai, making his skin sting painfully.

He couldn’t block it! There was simply no way to block it; the difference in cultivation was too great.

The only reason he’d managed to injure a Saint Envoy-level expert just now was by catching him off guard, and the greatest credit belonged to the Years Like a Shuttle Seal from the Great Emperor of Time. Now, with this real punch coming at him, he didn’t even have time to form a seal.

“Come out!” As Yang Kai retreated rapidly, he suddenly shouted.

In the next instant, a massive Stone Giant materialized with a thunderous crash. This Stone Giant looked nearly identical to the Stone Spirit Race, but its eyes held less of that wild ferocity and instead glimmered with a hint of intelligence.

Incarnation!

As soon as it appeared, the Incarnation swung its fist forward to meet the attack.

The burly Saint Envoy’s triumphant strike had not yet landed on Yang Kai when, to his shock, a Stone Spirit suddenly appeared before him. He couldn’t help but twitch at the corner of his eye, thinking he was seeing things.

But when the fist came at him, he realized this was no illusion at all.

There was no time to change moves in his haste; he could only grit his teeth and clash fists with the Incarnation.

Boom…

A thunderous crash resounded. The Incarnation staggered back two steps, while the burly Saint Envoy let out a muffled groan. A faint crack sounded from his wrist, and his whole body was sent flying backward like a ragged sack.

In terms of cultivation, this burly Saint Envoy’s Third Stage of the Emperor Realm far surpassed the Incarnation, but in terms of raw strength, the Incarnation could completely overwhelm him! In this clash, the burly Saint Envoy suffered a heavy loss.

The six Saint Envoys watching the battle nearby were all stunned.

Each one seemed petrified, standing there in a daze as if they’d lost all sense, unable to accept what had just happened.

On the surface, this human, who seemed the weakest, had actually forced back a Yao King and injured two Saint Envoys in a very short time. Even though the burly Saint Envoy wasn’t wounded by his own hand, such a record was still shocking enough.

What the yao couldn’t figure out most was where this Stone Spirit had suddenly popped out from.

Wasn’t it said that the Stone Spirit Race was born with no more than ten members, and that if they exceeded ten, disaster would strike? Counting this last Stone Spirit that appeared, there were now eleven in the tribe! The myth had been broken.

This was outrageous. If the Stone Spirit Race could surpass the number ten, what other race in the world could possibly stand against them? These guys were all battle maniacs, and every one of them who reached adulthood was terrifyingly strong.

“Go help them!” Yang Kai landed on the Incarnation’s shoulder, glanced over at the Stone Spirit Race, and called out in a low voice. At the same time, he hooked his hand in a certain direction, as if summoning something.

The situation for the Stone Spirit Race was far from optimistic. Even though they were born to fight and never tired, even though they possessed boundless strength and tough bodies, facing three times as many Yao Kings, they were still being beaten into a sorry state, struggling to hold on.

Each Stone Spirit seemed to have gone mad, unleashing their power recklessly, but they simply couldn’t do anything to those agile Yao Kings. Instead, they were scattered, unable to support each other, forced to fight alone.

Basically, every Stone Spirit had to face three Yao King-level experts, and these Yao Kings were extremely cunning. They worked together: two would restrain the Stone Spirit’s movements on the ground, while the other flew in the air, looking for a chance to unleash a powerful yao technique.

Although the Stone Spirits weren’t in mortal danger for now, if this went on, it was only a matter of time before they were wiped out.

The Elder clearly realized this too. A look of resolve flashed in his eyes as he shouted, “Mu Na, help me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, multicolored rays of light suddenly spread out from behind him. Those lights gathered and extended, directly forming two radiant wings behind him.

Yang Kai was startled at the sight, suddenly realizing that this must be the Wood Spirits lending their power. Those dazzling wings were surely the help the Wood Spirits had given the Stone Spirit Race with their own strength.

No wonder he hadn’t seen the Wood Spirits when summoning the Stone Spirits earlier, and no wonder they had all come along before the battle began. It turned out the two races truly lived and thrived together, supporting one another—not simply as protector and dependent, but as partners, each lending strength to the other.

The greatest weakness of the Stone Spirit Race was their inability to fly, due to their physical structure. But the Wood Spirit Race could grant them that ability.

Swish, swish, swish…

Suddenly, a pair of vividly colored wings appeared behind each Stone Spirit. As those wings fluttered, they carried the Stone Spirits nimbly through the air, as if they were a natural part of their bodies, without the slightest awkwardness.

The Yao Kings’ faces darkened. They all soared into the air, surrounding and blocking the Stone Spirits from all sides, determined not to let them break through the lines.

The Saint Envoys who had been watching could no longer sit still and also moved to join the fray.

In an instant, the sky was filled with mighty figures battling fiercely. Heaven and earth changed color, the sun and moon lost their light, and the collision of various laws seemed as if it would shatter the world itself.

“What about you?” Yang Kai’s face darkened as he looked at the Incarnation. The battlefield had shifted to the sky, and the Incarnation couldn’t do much there.

The Incarnation grinned and said, “I have the help of the Wood Spirits too.”

Swish, swish…

Suddenly, light spread out behind him as well, and two wings extended. With a leap, he shot straight into the sky.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, realizing the Incarnation must have already received help from the Wood Spirits earlier. He breathed a sigh of relief, swung the Myriad Sword forward, and shouted sternly, “Kill!”

…

Several thousand li away from the Blood Gate, four figures sped toward it like the wind. It wouldn’t be long before they reached the battlefield.

Each of these four figures radiated a terrifying aura, deep and unfathomable as the sea. They were none other than the Four Great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land.

Earlier, they had received a report from Xie Wuwei and gone to investigate the Mountain and River Bell. When they arrived, they did indeed see the bell, but no matter what they tried, they couldn’t subdue it, let alone take it away. The bell just sat in a valley, unmoving, and no one knew why it had appeared out of nowhere.

The suppressive power of the bell was so great that even the Four Great Saint Venerables dared not underestimate it.

Just as the four Saint Venerables were at their wits’ end, they suddenly sensed something unusual happening at the Blood Gate.

Three thousand li wasn’t exactly near, but it wasn’t far either. The Four Great Saint Venerables’ senses were extremely keen, and the fierce battle over there couldn’t escape their notice.

In an instant, the four realized they had fallen for a diversion.

They didn’t hesitate and immediately rushed back toward the Blood Gate. After all, the Mountain and River Bell wasn’t going anywhere, but nothing could be allowed to go wrong at the Blood Gate.

Before they could reach the Blood Gate, however, a terrifying aura suddenly swept over them from behind, making even them feel as if they were being suppressed.

“Mountain and River Bell!” Cang Gou suddenly turned around and stopped in his tracks. Sure enough, he saw a streak of light rapidly approaching, and in the blink of an eye, it was upon them.

Luan Feng, Fan Wu, and Shi Huo all turned pale, not daring to face it head-on. They hurriedly scattered to either side.

Whoosh…

The Mountain and River Bell flew straight through the middle of the four Saint Venerables, heading forward. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared from sight.

“What’s going on!” Shi Huo exclaimed, still shaken. Just now, he’d thought someone was going to use the Mountain and River Bell to suppress them, and he’d nearly unleashed his Origin Power in panic.

But instead, the Mountain and River Bell had simply flown away. The situation was truly baffling.

The other three Saint Venerables also looked uncertain and suspicious.

Suddenly, Fan Wu seemed to realize something. His face darkened, as if covered in frost, and he gritted his teeth. “This Mountain and River Bell actually has a master!”

Luan Feng’s beautiful eyes widened in shock. “You mean… its master summoned it back?”

Fan Wu snorted coldly. “What other explanation is there?”

Cang Gou’s expression turned ugly. He looked toward the Blood Gate and said bitterly, “Someone managed to subdue the Mountain and River Bell and is even using it to distract us!”

Fan Wu said, “Whoever it is, their goal is definitely the Blood Gate. Let’s go!”

With that, he hurried forward.

Luan Feng, Cang Gou, and Shi Huo exchanged glances and quickly followed.

Dozens of li behind, Xie Wuwei wore a bitter expression as he chased after the four Saint Venerables. But he couldn’t match their speed and could only eat their dust. He had also seen the Mountain and River Bell fly past just now and knew for certain it was Yang Kai’s doing.

Deep down, he cursed Yang Kai thoroughly, but he couldn’t help worrying for him, afraid that something might happen to Yang Kai.

Now that he was Yang Kai’s soul slave, if Yang Kai died, he would die as well.

“Kid, you’d better not get yourself killed, and you’d better run fast. The Saint Venerables are already on their way back.” Xie Wuwei prayed silently in his heart.

Above the Blood Gate, the demons and beasts were locked in chaotic battle. The Stone Spirits charged left and right, but they still couldn’t break through the defenses, all of them trapped in place.

After all, the numbers were too lopsided. With the Yao Kings going all out, the Stone Spirits had no way to escape.

At that moment, a streak of light shot in from afar, heading straight for the center of the battlefield.

That streak of light seemed to contain an extremely terrifying aura. Wherever it passed, heaven and earth trembled and shuddered.

“Die, human!” The burly Saint Envoy who had been injured by the Incarnation roared. Behind him, the phantom of a giant, multicolored tiger suddenly appeared and lunged at Yang Kai with a flicker.

Having suffered a heavy loss to the Incarnation before, he didn’t dare get too close now. He only wanted to use his secret technique to kill this brat from a distance.

At this moment, the Incarnation was being entangled by another Yao King and couldn’t spare a hand to help Yang Kai. Watching the giant tiger phantom pounce, he was instantly filled with rage and roared madly. The Heaven Devouring Domain erupted, and the violent suction even began to draw out the Yao King’s qi and blood.
