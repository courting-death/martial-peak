## Chapter 2323 — I’ll Cut You Down

“If you rush cultivation, you’ll only end up losing more than you gain.” Yang Kai smiled faintly, having already noticed Hua Qingsi’s impatience.

“It’s not like I don’t understand that, but if you were in my position, you’d know how I feel.” Hua Qingsi sighed and waved her hand. “Forget it, let’s not talk about this. Where are we, and why did you call me out?”

"This is the Chiyue Sect."

“Chiyue Sect?” Hua Qingsi raised her delicate brows, thought for a moment, and said, “You mean the Chiyue Sect that’s famous for its puppet arts?”

“Sister Hua, you know this Sect?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Hua Qingsi said, "Chiyue Sect isn't a first-rate Sect, but it's fairly well-known in the Southern Territory. How could I not have heard of it? I once studied their puppet arts for a while. But unfortunately, I heard their inheritance was cut off and the Sect has declined for who knows how many years. Now, even the remaining puppets in the Sect cannot be controlled."

“That’s true.” Yang Kai nodded, immediately realizing Hua Qingsi knew quite a bit about Chiyue Sect.

“So what are you doing at Chiyue Sect? Are you also after their puppet arts?” Hua Qingsi asked curiously.

“I’m here on someone’s behalf, to help with something.” Yang Kai smiled faintly and briefly explained the situation.

Hua Qingsi listened in amazement. “There’s actually a secret realm inside Chiyue Sect? This is the first I’ve heard of it. No wonder the Sect declined—if the entrance to the secret realm was sealed, that’s quite possible. With your abilities, repairing the entrance shouldn’t be difficult.”

“I’ll do my best.” Yang Kai shrugged.

Suddenly, Hua Qingsi grinned slyly. “Young Master Yang, if you find the Chiyue Sect’s inheritance in that secret realm, could you make a copy for me to see?”

“That’s not really appropriate…” Yang Kai glanced at her sideways. “After all, it’s their inheritance. What’s the point of secretly observing and comprehending it?”

Hua Qingsi pouted. “You make it sound like you’re not interested. Copy it or don’t, it’s up to you. Anyway, I’ll be advancing to Emperor soon, so I don’t have time to study those things.”

Yang Kai chuckled. “I’ll give it a try.”

Hua Qingsi said, “That’s more like it. I’ve heard Chiyue Sect’s puppets are divided into four grades: Heaven, Earth, Mystery, and Yellow. Now, the people of Chiyue Sect can only control puppets below Mystery-Grade. The methods to control Earth-Grade and above have long been lost.”

“That’s right. On this main peak alone, there are more than thirty Earth-Grade puppets, but Ye Hen and the others can’t control them at all. There also seem to be quite a few Heaven-Grade puppets.” Yang Kai looked a bit emotional, recalling those strange little peaks he’d seen before, feeling a deep sense of awe inside.

Hua Qingsi pursed her lips and smiled. “But do you know, above Heaven-Grade puppets, there’s also something called Spirit-Grade puppets?”

Yang Kai’s eyes widened in astonishment. “Spirit-Grade puppets?”

Hua Qingsi nodded. “Whether such puppets really exist, I don’t know. I only read about them in some records from Star God Palace. The information wasn’t complete, but you know how vast Star God Palace is—they research secret arts from all the major Sects in the Southern Territory and even the entire Star Realm.”

“Tell me more.” Yang Kai’s interest was piqued.

Hua Qingsi said solemnly, “Chiyue Sect’s Heaven-Grade puppets—each one can display the strength of an Emperor Realm expert. The very best of them are not inferior to the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. That’s why they were once a top Sect in the Southern Territory. As for Spirit-Grade puppets… it’s said they possess sentience, can think, have their own consciousness, and can even cultivate various secret arts to continually improve their strength. Just like… just like your big rock!”

She was, of course, referring to the Incarnation.

Yang Kai was stunned, staring at Hua Qingsi in shock.

The reason puppets are called puppets is because they have no consciousness and only act under orders. If they could think and possess consciousness, even improve their strength through cultivation, could they still be called puppets? That would be the right of living beings.

Hua Qingsi chuckled. “Who knows if it’s true or not? That’s just what I read. Back then, Chiyue Sect was famous for its puppet arts, but there weren’t many Spirit-Grade puppets, and no one knows where those few ended up.”

Yang Kai remained silent for a long time.

The idea of puppets gaining sentience sounds unbelievable at first, but on second thought, it’s not entirely impossible. The world is vast and full of wonders—even Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit that gained form, so why couldn’t a puppet develop sentience?

It's just that the required conditions are far too demanding.

“By the way, why did you call me out? If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back to cultivating.” Hua Qingsi saw Yang Kai spacing out for a while and couldn’t help but ask.

Yang Kai snapped back to his senses. “Sister Hua, don’t go back just yet. I need your help with something.”

“What is it?”

“On my way to Chiyue Sect, I ran into a few old friends. But the Vice Sect Master of Chiyue Sect doesn’t seem to have a good impression of us. I’m worried that if I’m not around, that old guy might cause them trouble.”

He needed to repair the Space Array for Chiyue Sect, and if possible, he wanted to explore the secret realm to see if he could find any opportunities. Naturally, he couldn’t stay by Chi Yue and the others’ side at all times.

Chi Yue and the others were only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, while Shi Cangying was at the Third Stage. Their cultivation gap was huge. If Yang Kai wasn’t there and Shi Cangying made a move, Chi Yue and the others would have no way to resist.

Calling Hua Qingsi out was to secretly protect Chi Yue and the others.

After Yang Kai explained his thoughts, Hua Qingsi agreed immediately. “No problem, Young Master Yang. You just focus on your own business. It’s only a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—if he really wants to seek death, I don’t mind sending him on his way.”

As she spoke, her eyes flashed coldly. Clearly, she was annoyed that this guy had delayed her cultivation, leaving her in a foul mood.

Although Hua Qingsi and Shi Cangying were at the same realm, their backgrounds were different. Shi Cangying was only the Vice Sect Master of Chiyue Sect, and the techniques and secret arts he cultivated couldn’t compare to those of Hua Qingsi from Star God Palace.

If the two really fought to the death, Shi Cangying would have no chance of winning.

“Then I’ll trouble you, Sister Hua.” Yang Kai grinned.

Hua Qingsi gave Yang Kai a reproachful look and said softly, “Ever since I gave you my Soul Brand, I’ve resigned myself to my fate. I just hope you’ll treat me a little better in the future, not scold or beat me at will. That’s all I ask.”

As she spoke, she even wiped the corner of her eye, looking like a woman resigned to her fate.

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat and wiped his forehead. “Sister Hua, don’t talk like that in front of that yao woman, or I’m doomed.”

Hua Qingsi looked aggrieved, pursing her red lips. “Young Master Yang, with Sister Hua and Liu Yan, isn’t that enough? Why do you still want to provoke other women? What do we lack compared to them?”

Cold sweat poured down Yang Kai’s forehead as he forced a laugh. “Stop it, or I’ll cut you down.”

Only then did Hua Qingsi burst into a peal of laughter, twisting her body as she darted to the door. She turned and said, “Young Master Yang, you’re so afraid of that yao woman. Looks like she’s got something on you.”

“What are you doing!” Yang Kai cried out in alarm. “Are you going to find her?”

Hua Qingsi said, “Relax, I’ll protect them in secret. There are so many rooms here, I’ll just find one to meditate in.”

With that, she opened the door, slipped out nimbly, and disappeared.

Yang Kai felt uneasy, releasing his Divine Sense. Sensing that Hua Qingsi really had just found a room to cultivate in, he finally relaxed.

…

The next day, Ye Qinghan came to find Yang Kai. But to his surprise, Ye Qinghan didn’t mention repairing the Space Array. Instead, she brought some medicinal herbs.

These herbs were the ones Yang Kai had previously asked her to find, to be used in refining an antidote pill for Chai Hu.

Although these herbs weren’t too difficult to find, they weren’t easy either. Yang Kai hadn’t expected Chiyue Sect to gather them all in just one day. Since the ingredients were ready, he decided to refine the antidote pill first.

After thanking Ye Qinghan and seeing her off, Yang Kai immediately began refining.

In less than half a day, a batch of antidote pills was successfully made.

In Chai Hu’s room, Chi Yue and the others gathered anxiously, watching him closely.

Chai Hu held a jade bottle in his hand, inside which were six round Spiritual Pills. He sat on the floor, gripping the bottle, looking a bit lost.

“Yang Kai, is this the antidote pill you mentioned?” Chi Yue turned to look at Yang Kai and asked.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded solemnly. “Senior Chai can take one now. The rest of you help him refine the medicinal effects. After three days, take another. In half a month, the yao poison will be cured.”

Chai Hu trembled, looked up at Yang Kai, and swallowed. “After the yao poison is cured, my cultivation…”

“You’ll still be at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Hearing this, Chai Hu’s expression dimmed, and the others also looked heavy-hearted. They all thought Chai Hu would be stuck like this for the rest of his life, with no hope of further progress.

Yang Kai continued, “But as long as you keep cultivating, you’ll recover quickly.”

Chai Hu’s eyes suddenly lit up as he stared at Yang Kai. “Young Master Yang, do you mean… I can recover to how I was before?”

Yang Kai said, “Of course. Senior, it’s only because of the yao poison that your cultivation was suppressed. It hasn’t been long, and your foundation isn’t damaged. As long as you work hard, you’ll recover in time.”

Ghost Ancestor asked nervously, “Sect Master, are you sure?”

Yang Kai smiled. “How could I joke about something like this?”

“That’s wonderful!” Chi Yue finally relaxed, as if a heavy stone had been lifted from her heart. If Chai Hu really couldn’t progress any further, none of them would ever be at ease, since he had stayed behind to buy them time and face danger alone.

Now that Yang Kai said Chai Hu’s future cultivation would be unhindered, they were naturally overjoyed.
