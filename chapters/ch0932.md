## Chapter 932 — I'm Going to Fight You

I don't know why, but when these three people appeared, Qiu Xu felt a sudden chill, as if a deathly aura rushed at him, making his skin crawl.

He had no sense of safety unless he stood beside Xiu Li.

"Weren't you the one who said the Transcendent Realm can't contend with the Saint Realm?" Yang Kai turned his head and looked coldly at Qiu Xu.

"Yes. May I ask who you are?" Qiu Xu frowned.

"I don't see why I should give my name to a dead man."

"You're so insolent — who exactly are you?" Qiu Xu's expression hardened; sensing the newcomers' hostility, he subtly signaled Xiu Li to act on cue, and she nodded slightly.

Yang Kai ignored him and only instructed Li Rong, "I leave that woman to the two of you; I'll deal with this man."

Li Rong nodded. "Master, be careful."

She didn't stop Yang Kai because she knew his fury was burning and he wanted to personally kill the one who had just acted arrogantly; with her and Han Fei covering, even if Yang Kai couldn't overcome the man, there would be no mortal danger.

Two pairs of beautiful eyes fixed on Xiu Li, and an invisible pressure descended from the heavens.

The voluptuous beauty called Xiu Li stiffened instantly; the flow of her power was blocked as if she were trapped in a quagmire.

Her heart seized with terror; only then did she realize how formidable the two women who'd appeared were, and her delicate body couldn't help trembling.

Qiu Xu's face changed. The moment Li Rong and Han Fei used force he sensed something was wrong; horror filled his features and he could no longer bother about the Blood Servants Hall — he flickered and attempted to fly into Zhongdu's interior.

He was going to find Wu Zheng!

Although displeased with how Wu Zheng had divided up the spoils, in this place Wu Zheng was the strongest — a Second Stage Saint, far more powerful than he.

Just as he shifted his body, a figure blurred before his eyes; the brash young man was already blocking his path.

Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

Qiu Xu saw through Yang Kai's true cultivation at a glance; his face brightened with unexpected joy as he muttered that the young man was courting disaster, then he shouted, "Kid, get out of the way!"

At the same time he reached out to grab Yang Kai.

He intended to seize Yang Kai and buy himself a sliver of life.

Yang Kai didn't move; he only looked at him coldly. When that massive hand settled on his shoulder and gripped hard, Yang Kai suddenly unleashed the power within him.

A scorching wave burst out. Qiu Xu gave a strangled cry and hastily withdrew his hand, his face blanching in disbelief.

This youth, though only a Third Stage Transcendent, radiated a force purer and more majestic than his Saint cultivation.

That scorching True Yuan shot through the palm into his meridians, rampaging through flesh and channels, penetrating his organs and attempting to destroy his vital energy.

Not daring to slacken, Qiu Xu hurriedly rallied his Saint Yuan to suppress the heat; his body temperature soared, his blood seemed to boil, and his eyes reddened.

Before he could recover, a golden spear streaked through the air — the weapon emanated earth-shattering fluctuations, as if it could tear space itself, breaking the bounds of distance and rapidly magnifying in his vision.

Qiu Xu was horrified at the spear's killing intent and scrambled to dodge.

Whoosh...

The Heaven-Slaying Spear missed and flew dozens of li before fading into points of light and vanishing.

One Heaven-Slaying Spear after another formed in Yang Kai's hand; he stood in midair and hurled them without pause.

Like a locust swarm, the sky glittered with golden light.

Qiu Xu was miserable, forced only to dodge the Nine Heavens Divine Technique; he had no means of blocking it and his face went pale.

"Dodge — keep dodging. Let's see how long you can dodge!" Yang Kai's face was indifferent; his power erupted without apparent limit, and, mocking in the same sarcastic tone Qiu Xu had used earlier, he unleashed the Heaven-Slaying Spears like a primeval god as beams of golden light shot at Qiu Xu.

Qiu Xu had no time to answer; evading the attacks occupied all his attention and his expression soured.

"Aren't you a Saint? If you've got the guts, fight properly. What are you afraid of a Transcendent for? Come on, show me everything you've got — today I'll let you see how a Transcendent slays a Saint." Yang Kai sneered cruelly. After the Heaven-Slaying Spear came the Profound Heaven Sword and the Nether Heaven Lock, the Nine Heavens Divine Technique flaring one after another.

Below, Tu Feng and the others watched in stunned silence, emotions churning, unable to settle.

Back then, nurtured by Yang Kai, they had already advanced to the Transcendent Realm before his departure, standing at the very pinnacle of this world.

Yang Kai had been gone for over ten years; they had trained diligently and now nearly every Blood Servant hoped to reach the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

But a few months ago a force had appeared they couldn't contend with and seized control of the Zhongdu Eight Great Families.

Today they were being hunted by this Qiu Xu with nowhere to turn; Tang Yuxian was nearly crushed to death by his grasp.

The young master suddenly struck, like thunder, forcing Qiu Xu to flee in panic, without even time to reply.

The Blood Servants' hearts were lifted and a swell of pride rose as they saw the once-dominant Qiu Xu in disgrace; everyone felt exhilarated.

Li Rong and Han Fei watched with bright eyes, full of delight.

Although they knew Yang Kai was formidable, since following him they had never seen him fight a true expert and didn't know where his limits lay.

The two had privately decided that if Yang Kai showed any sign of struggle they would immediately intervene.

But matters were nothing like they had feared — a First Stage Saint had not a single chance against Yang Kai.

The two were certain Yang Kai could dispatch him with ease.

Yang Kai hadn't used Demon God Transformation; he was fighting with his fundamental strength alone.

At that moment they finally relaxed; they applied pressure to keep Xiu Li from aiding while focusing on Yang Kai's battle.

"I'm going to fight you to the death!" In a flurry of evasions, Qiu Xu suddenly roared and a massive bell shot out; the bell gave off a tremendous roar that shook souls, rippling with light as shockwaves radiated outward.

The incoming Heaven-Slaying Spears and Profound Heaven Sword faltered and their force diminished.

The Blood Servants Hall below, upon hearing the bell, each displayed extreme agony; bodies trembled, blood swelled and faces flushed as if they might burst at any moment.

Li Rong waved and dispersed the pressure on their side; the Blood Servants Hall people regained their color and looked at her gratefully.

Qiu Xu's divine sense burst forth as he controlled the secret treasure bell, unleashing its full might; he hid behind it and used the treasure to block Yang Kai's attacks, desperately charging at him.

He was clearly making a last-ditch gamble, hoping for mutual destruction — and if he could seize Yang Kai alive, all the better.

"A Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure!" Yang Kai sneered, ignoring the demonic noise; instead of retreating he surged forward with fierce momentum.

True Yang Yuan Qi exploded forth and Yang Kai, like a blazing fireball, barreled through the sonic assault.

After a moment, a massive boom resounded.

The great bell's toll echoed throughout Zhongdu, churning qi and blood and unsettling the heart.

Qiu Xu, hiding behind the bell, was struck by a tremendous force and blasted backward like a kite, bleeding in midair, his face pale and his eyes bewildered.

He could not believe what had just happened.

That Third Stage Transcendent youth had used his body to collide with the secret treasure — not only did he block its attack, he had knocked Qiu Xu flying.

Yet he had only retreated a dozen steps before regaining his footing.

What sort of physical constitution was needed to clash bodily with a secret treasure?

Only now did he fully grasp that the young man's combat power was on a completely different level: though his cultivation was higher, the youth could fight beyond his rank.

Qiu Xu's eyes dimmed; as he flew backward he howled hoarsely, "Wu Zheng!"

The bell was in Yang Kai's hand; he casually tossed it away and it vanished. His figure blurred and he caught up with Qiu Xu, sneering, "No one's coming to help you — today you'll surely die!"

Pure True Yuan was driven into Qiu Xu by Yang Kai; Qiu Xu tried to resist but could not defend.

His body rapidly overheated, his blood boiled like scalding water, and huge blisters surfaced on his skin.

Boom...

Qiu Xu's body burst apart; in midair a grotesque, bloody blossom bloomed — his death was utterly tragic.

Xiu Li's body trembled and her heart filled with terror. She had watched the whole fight but to the end she couldn't understand how a Saint could be so casually slain by a Transcendent.

The scene utterly overturned her understanding of martial power.

Staring at the youth's fearsome back, Xiu Li couldn't help but shudder.

"Master, what should we do with this woman?" Li Rong asked softly.

"Kill her!" Yang Kai replied tersely.

"Understood!" Han Fei answered; she moved and came beside Xiu Li, lightly patting her a few times.

In the next moment the seductress's body was covered in ice crystals and gradually frozen, like a lifelike ice sculpture; her terrified expression was clearly visible through the ice.

The ice sculpture fell and shattered on the ground.

The voluptuous beauty died utterly without a trace.

"Who committed this murder?" a furious roar came from a distance, and a ruddy-faced elder leisurely appeared, furious as he scanned the scene. When he saw Yang Kai's face his expression changed: "The lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?"
