## Chapter 1920 — Restoration

Yang Kai stepped into the interior of the main hall and immediately felt a faint ripple of spatial power wash over him.

Looking closely, at the very center of the hall there stood a Space Array, faintly emitting a phosphorescent glow; many martial artists were on alert around it, and hidden among them were experts scanning the surroundings.

This had to be the central hub of the Space Array for Shuiyue Star, Yang Kai realized — otherwise it would not be guarded so heavily.

Ai Ou said, "This Space Array connects all the major cities and important strongholds on Shuiyue Star; it is an existence of extreme importance."

Yang Kai nodded, sent his Divine Sense to sweep over it, and quickly understood the array's internal structure, though he paid it little mind — laying out such a Space Array was nothing difficult for him.

"What does Senior want me to do with this?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"Not this thing." Ai Ou smiled mysteriously, gestured for Yang Kai to follow, then led him to the side and through a small door where a staircase spiraled downward.

Around the stairs were studded fist-sized Luminous Pearls, casting a soft, warm light that kept the area from feeling gloomy.

Ai Ou led the way; after about the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the two arrived at some underground chamber.

The space suddenly opened up before them, and Yang Kai, astonished, discovered a hidden world underground — an incredibly spacious secret chamber. It was empty to the eye, save for something standing silently at the very center, exuding an ancient, desolate aura.

"This is…" Yang Kai's eyelids twitched as he hurried forward. Using the light from the surrounding Luminous Pearls, he circled the formation-like thing that occupied roughly a radius of five zhang.

"This is a Great Space Array?" Yang Kai looked at Ai Ou in amazement.

"Indeed!" Ai Ou nodded seriously. "As you can see, this is indeed a Great Space Array — an array capable of transmitting from Shuiyue Star to another star!"

"It can't be used?" Yang Kai asked again.

"Hmm, something is wrong with it. According to ancestral records, it has been unusable for over ten thousand years. Throughout the generations, the Commerce Guild's leaders have tried to repair it, but none succeeded. Yang Kai, it's not that I doubt your skill, but this matter is of great consequence. I must see with my own eyes. If you can repair this array, then I will believe your words!" Ai Ou said solemnly.

"How hard can that be?" Yang Kai grinned, his expression unexpectedly relaxed.

Ai Ou's face suddenly brightened. "You truly can repair it?"

"I can," Yang Kai nodded. "But Senior, where does this array connect to?"

Ai Ou frowned slightly, as if there were something awkward to say, but after a moment's thought he continued, "You have been frank with me and are close with Xue Yue, so you're not exactly an outsider — it won't hurt to tell you. Have you heard that within this Star Domain there exist many Dark Stars?"

"Dark Stars?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Those stars that conventional means cannot reach, even invisible to the naked eye, hidden deep within the Star Domain?"

"You indeed know of them," Ai Ou nodded. "Such Dark Stars are scattered across the vast Star Domain; though not numerous, they are far from rare — ordinary people simply cannot detect them. In the present Star Domain, any star of value has long been carved up by the major powers. For institutions like my Hengluo Commerce Guild, which controls as many as eighteen stars, the most reliable way to grow isn't reckless expansion but developing and locating Dark Stars. Expansion and invasion are fraught with unknowns, whereas seeking Dark Stars is safe and convenient — but Dark Stars hide deeply and are extremely difficult to find; one might pass right by one without ever realizing it."

Yang Kai nodded. "I've heard that within the Star Domain there may be heaven and earth formations that conceal certain stars; the mysteries of those formations are such that even experts at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm might not be able to perceive them."

As he spoke, Yang Kai's mind stirred and he asked with surprise, "Senior, do you mean this Space Array connects to a Dark Star?"

Ai Ou's face showed a hint of excitement as he nodded. "Exactly — it connects to a Dark Star. Perhaps you don't know, but my Hengluo Commerce Guild's ancestors once had dealings with the Starry Sky Emperor; that Dark Star was discovered by the Emperor, who later informed the guild's forebears. This array was set up by the Emperor himself at that time."

Could it possibly also have something to do with Yang Yan?

Yang Kai was somewhat surprised, though he at last understood why the array before him resembled the arrays he had laid out himself.

It was because it came from Yang Yan's hand, and Yang Kai's own Space Array diagrams had been taught to him by Yang Yan — it would have been strange if they were different.

Ai Ou had expected Yang Kai to show some shock upon hearing that the Emperor had once been acquainted with the guild's ancestors, but instead Yang Kai's face remained indifferent, which raised Ai Ou's estimation of him even further.

Only someone of calm disposition could be so composed. Little did Ai Ou know that Yang Kai had spent considerable time with Yang Yan, and in knowledge of the Emperor there was no one in the Star Domain who could surpass him.

Ai Ou continued, "That Dark Star is a mining star of immense value. For over ten thousand years, the guild has owned the treasure mountain but could not enter it — we have shamed the Emperor's trust. Yang Kai, if you can repair this array, the guild will owe you a real debt of gratitude, and I…"

Ai Ou could not finish his sentence.

He had meant to express his thanks to Yang Kai, but found there was little anyone could say that matched the scale of what Yang Kai had already brought to the guild and to him personally; the benefits were nearly incalculable.

He might as well sell the entire Commerce Guild to repay him.

"Rest assured, Elder — leave this to me," Yang Kai said, nodding with unquestioned resolve.

"Good. Then I'll watch keenly. How long will you need?" Ai Ou asked excitedly.

"Wait a moment!" Yang Kai was already at the long-neglected Formation Foundation of the Space Array, releasing his Divine Sense to study it closely, and after a short inspection his face revealed he had a plan.

In the next moment he withdrew various materials from his Spatial Ring, including genuine Ethereal Crystals he had brought out from the Lost Realm.

Scorching firepower burst from his body; the materials before him kept shifting shape as they were fused into the Formation Foundation. Yang Kai's Divine Sense flitted through the foundation, using Divine Sense Fire to mend and perfect the internal spiritual array diagram.

In less than the time it took an incense stick to burn, he waved his hand and the Ethereal Crystals were set into their proper positions in the array.

The entire array suddenly hummed; a clear swell of spatial force surged forth, and the once grey array now shone with a faint radiance.

Ai Ou stood dumbstruck at the side — his mouth opened so wide it might have swallowed a fist.

As the leader of the Hengluo Commerce Guild and an expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, having lived most of his life, he had seen countless strange things and could remain impassive even at a mountain's collapse.

But now he was genuinely shocked.

He had thought repairing the Space Array would not be easy.

He thought it would take at least a month or two, perhaps one or two years.

He assumed Yang Kai would have to expend enormous mental will and spiritual power...

He thought many things…

But it had been only the time of an incense stick! Yang Kai had solved the problem that had vexed the Hengluo Commerce Guild and countless elites for over ten thousand years.

Was this kid even human?

Ai Ou felt as if he had broken; he stared ahead in disbelief, but the array's hum, the rise and fall of spatial power, and the faint radiance left no doubt — the Space Array had truly been repaired.

While he was still in a daze, he noticed Yang Kai take out more materials and refine them in his hands; before long a token-like object took shape.

Yang Kai beckoned to Ai Ou and smiled, "Senior, shall we take a look on the other side?"

"This… this is already enough?" Ai Ou asked suspiciously — it was not that he doubted Yang Kai's skill, but what he had witnessed exceeded his imagination.

"Yes. This array traces back to the same lineage as what I learned; only the internal spiritual diagram had a few faults. I fixed them, reinforced the Formation Foundation, and supplemented some Ethereal Crystals — it will function for another ten thousand years without fail!"

Ai Ou swallowed hard. At the thought that the other side led to the mining star his guild leaders had longed for across generations, he could no longer contain his excitement and leapt into the array in a single bound.

"Hold this and steady your soul," Yang Kai said, handing him the freshly forged token and offering a warning.

"This is your specially forged Teleportation Token? Without it the Space Array cannot be used?" Ai Ou asked, thoughtful — Shen Tu had already reported everything to him, so he knew of the token's existence.

"Correct, but not that it cannot be used — if provoked recklessly, one would be banished into the endless void," Yang Kai grinned.

"Excellent, with this trick of yours I can relax," Ai Ou laughed loudly and raised his hand, "Set off — let me see how rich that mining star truly is."

Yang Kai fell silent. He inserted numerous Saint Crystals into the formation, formed the hand seals, and set the array in motion.

A blinding light engulfed Yang Kai and Ai Ou, and in the next moment the two had vanished.

Countless tens of thousands of miles away, on a lonely, desolate star, within an ancient palace, a radiance flared up and lasted for ten heartbeats before gradually dissipating.

When the light faded, the figures of Yang Kai and Ai Ou appeared.

No wonder Ai Ou was an expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm; his Divine Sense was mighty. Even after the cross-star transmission, he quickly recovered and did not go as dizzy as Shen Tu had back then.

He hurriedly looked around, his Divine Sense rapidly expanding outward as he probed the surroundings for danger.
