## Chapter 1788 — The Tragic Xu Wei

“Brother Zi, what’s the need for this?” Xu Wei forced out an awkward smile. “I’ve never been your match from beginning to end—if you truly wish to kill me, I’ve no power to resist. But don’t forget, Brother Zi, that brat said he’d remain hidden within the rifts. Your son’s cultivation is only at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—if that boy were to ambush him successfully, you should know well what the consequences would be.”

"Of course I know that," Zi Long replied with the same cold expression. "But what has that to do with you? The safety of my son is my concern; I will see to it myself."

"You can't say it like that." Xu Wei shook his head. "If this old man is present, won't it at least distract that brat somewhat?"

Zi Long knit his brow, appearing to ponder. After a long moment he raised his eyelids and said, "Elder Xu speaks sensibly."

Xu Wei breathed out in relief.

"However... Elder Xu, your own situation is hardly optimistic now. Even if you can distract him, how much will that achieve? I would, in fact, be pleased to take this chance to kill you and avenge those disciples of mine who died in earlier years," Zi Long said, narrowing his eyes; a glint of murderous intent flashed across his gaze.

The heart Xu Wei had just managed to calm suddenly tightened again. While secretly cursing his luck, he also showered Yang Kai with every curse he could think of in his heart. If not for that brat’s earlier sneak attack, how would he have ended up in such a miserable state—where neither Heaven nor Earth would respond to his cries for help?

Zi Long snorted coldly. "Elder Xu, do not imagine I will give you a chance. I will give you two choices now: first, I kill you and end it all."

Xu Wei ground his teeth and asked in a low voice, "And the second?"

"Hand over your soul imprint and from now on obey my orders!" Zi Long folded his hands behind his back, looking at Xu Wei as if he were weighing him. "Choose for yourself — you have been through strife and should make a wise choice."

"Surrender my soul imprint!" Xu Wei's face chilled and he almost lost his temper with Zi Long on the spot. But thinking of the likely consequences, he forced his anger down.

To give up his soul imprint would mean he must obey Zi Long's commands forever; otherwise a single thought from him could make Xu Wei suffer worse than death.

Yet if he did not surrender it, he would surely die.

Xu Wei realized, with a start, that Zi Long disgusted him even more than Yang Kai did.

Yang Kai only used crafty tricks and gave people no respite with words; but Zi Long, as master of Purple Star and a famous figure in the Star Domain, would stoop to such base cruelty? That was truly shameful.

"Time is short. My patience is limited, Elder Xu — decide quickly," Zi Long said softly, but his words fell on Xu Wei's ears like an executioner's drum and tormented him horribly.

He looked troubled for a long moment, then clenched his teeth and said, "Very well. I admit defeat. If you want my soul imprint, take it! But Brother Zi, please do not trouble me too grievously in the future!"

Zi Long nodded with satisfaction. "I will not trouble you — because it is not I who will receive your soul imprint, but my son."

"What? Zi Donglai?" Xu Wei cried, glaring at Zi Donglai with anger painted across his face.

Zi Donglai was momentarily stunned, then his expression erupted into rapturous joy as he gratefully looked toward his father.

Although he was the Young Master of Purple Star and could mobilize some Void King Realm experts for his purposes, such summons were limited — which of those Void King Realm experts did not think themselves superior?

To get them to do one's bidding always required paying a price.

But now there was an opportunity to utterly command a Void King Realm expert; such fortune was like a gift from heaven. Zi Donglai was dizzy with happiness and overflowing gratitude for his father.

Then his mood shifted. Zi Donglai's face turned cold as he looked at Xu Wei. "What, Elder Xu — do you think that, as the Young Master, I am unqualified to control your soul imprint? If so, I need not have it. I never force the strong to do what they cannot bear."

His words sounded proper, worthy of a Young Master's bearing, but Xu Wei secretly spat curses in his heart.

Now that men held the knives and he was the fish, where could he resist? Besides, he had yielded before; though things were not as he'd guessed, he had little will left to oppose.

Sometimes matters are like that: once you yield one step, you yield the second, the third...

Thinking this, Xu Wei forced a smile and said, "Young Master is too flattering. Young Master is a dragon among men and will surely surpass this old man in achievement; I dare not think otherwise. To serve the Young Master is my honor."

"You are fine!" Zi Donglai smiled, the gloom Yang Kai had brought him washed away. He was euphoric and silently vowed if he met Yang Kai again he would make Xu Wei kill him to vent his hatred.

Although Xu Wei had lost an arm to the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, the injury had not substantially reduced his strength as a Void King Realm expert; with proper recuperation he remained a terrifying force.

"Elder Xu, do it quickly!" Zi Long urged, not wanting to drag things out.

Though unwilling, Xu Wei had no choice. He condensed his soul imprint and stepped to Zi Donglai, placing the imprint inside him.

Throughout the process Zi Long watched warily, giving Xu Wei no opportunity to try any trickery.

When it was done, Xu Wei felt a surge of desolation.

From that moment on he was no longer an elder of the Abandoned Nest; he was a servant, an enforcer at Zi Donglai's side — his freedom gone forever.

As this thought crossed his mind, Xu Wei's face suddenly changed. His Sea of Consciousness erupted, and a pain that made him nearly lose his mind shot through his head.

Even as a Void King Realm expert, he could not withstand such torment and anguish.

He howled and collapsed, clutching his skull and writhing on the ground.

He quickly understood what was happening and, forcing himself to remain conscious, clenched his teeth and said, "Young Master, why are you..."

"Hmm... it really works quite well." Zi Donglai watched Xu Wei's pitiful screams with no pity, instead savoring the sight as he pressed down on the soul imprint inside his own body.

Xu Wei’s screams grew ever more pitiful, ever more frantic. He howled incessantly, “Young Master, stop! If this continues, this old man’s very soul will be scattered! Ahhh!”

“Old man?” A cold light flashed in Zi Donglai’s eyes. “You dare call yourself an old man before me? Who gave you that right?”

"Ah! I... I was wrong, Young Master — please stop, I will never do so again!"

"Hahaha, you're clever — you might make a fine dog yet!" Zi Donglai laughed, his face twisted with a sick glee. Torturing a Void King Realm expert like this fulfilled him.

Yang Kai had mocked him before as a dog that only barked and could not bite; now he poured that resentment onto Xu Wei.

“Enough. Elder Xu is still your senior, after all. You are not to act like this again,” Zi Long glanced at his son and instructed coolly.

"Yes!" Zi Donglai answered, and then released his hold.

The intense pain in Xu Wei's Sea of Consciousness vanished at once, but he remained too weak to rise. He lay there for a long while before staggering to his feet, a hidden bitterness flickering behind his lowered eyelids.

As a Void King Realm expert and an elder of the Abandoned Nest, to have his soul imprint controlled and to be humiliated by a junior — how could he swallow such resentment?

But under this roof he must bow his head; Xu Wei would not be foolish enough to show his feelings openly.

He hid everything well, waiting for the day he could make Zi Long and his son pay back twice over.

"Elder Xu, you have no grievance against me, do you? I was only curious and made a little experiment; after all I've never before controlled a Void King Realm expert's soul imprint, so it's an unfamiliar thing," Zi Donglai said, gazing at Xu Wei with a faint smile.

"Of course not!" Xu Wei panted and kowtowed. "Young Master may call me by name in future; I do not presume to be called Third Elder. As for what just happened, I dare not bear it in my heart."

"Good!" Zi Donglai nodded with satisfaction. "Follow close to me and protect my safety. Once I grow powerful, you will receive your rewards."

"Yes!" Xu Wei bowed respectfully.

"By the way, since you entered this Medicine Valley, have you found anything useful? Show the Young Master," Zi Donglai suddenly asked, his eyes gleaming as if remembering something.

Xu Wei's face twitched and his heart stung, but he dared not resist. He removed his Spatial Ring and handed it to Zi Donglai with a fawning smile. "All my things are inside, Young Master — take a look and take whatever you like."

He had to do it; his life was now in others' hands and even those few things he had could not be preserved.

Zi Donglai made no pretense of courtesy. He took the Spatial Ring and probed it with his Divine Sense. After a moment he looked pleased and began taking out one valuable item after another.

The haul included not only what Xu Wei had gathered in Medicine Valley but also his personal hoard.

The Abandoned Nest was a den of villains; as an elder, Xu Wei had often slain and plundered. There were naturally many fine things in his ring.

Each item was of considerable worth, and even someone like Zi Donglai could not pass them by.

One piece after another was taken and put into Zi Donglai's own Spatial Ring. Xu Wei's heart bled, but he showed none of it and stood aside with a forced smile.
