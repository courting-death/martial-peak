## Chapter 2252 — You All Leave

It was clear that the middle-aged man from the Eight Directions Sect truly wished to settle the matter quietly. Although the strength of these Eight Directions Sect members was utterly overwhelming for the Qin Family, they were in the wrong, and the man did not want the incident to escalate and become a public scandal.

Qin Chaoyang’s expression was a mix of anger and sorrow. He said nothing, but anyone could see the unwillingness and fury in his eyes as he stood there, his fists clenched so tightly they cracked.

Seeing this, Lin Yun sneered repeatedly and said, “Old Family Head Qin, you’d better think carefully. One wrong decision, and your little Qin Family could lose everything!”

As he finished, his tone turned sinister, the threat unmistakable.

Just then, a voice sounded from outside the courtyard: “Two hundred thousand Source Crystals… to buy a life? Cough, cough… Is a human life so cheap?”

The speaker coughed lightly as he spoke, sounding gravely ill.

“Who is it!” Lin Yun shouted angrily, turning toward the source of the voice.

There, Qin Yu, supported by Xiao Hui, slowly entered. Her face was pale, her body frail, like a flower battered by wind and rain—truly pitiful to behold.

Lin Yun was momentarily stunned, then his eyes lit up as he stared at Qin Yu, excitement written all over his face.

Qin Yu was already beautiful, and now, though gravely ill, she possessed a sickly allure that utterly captivated Lin Yun.

As the middle-aged man had said, Lin Yun was obsessed with women. He had been in Fenglin City for nearly two months, staying with the Qin Family. Today, for some reason, his lust had gotten the better of him, leading him to harass the two maids—otherwise, none of this would have happened.

Now, seeing Qin Yu, he felt he must have been blind to have had designs on those two plain maids before. It was beneath his status.

If he was to have any thoughts, it should be for the woman before him!

“Yu’er!” Qin Chaoyang’s face changed, and he hurried to Qin Yu’s side, supporting her and scolding, “Why did you come out? Didn’t I tell you to rest?”

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “I just felt something was wrong… I couldn’t rest easy, so I came to look.”

As she spoke, her beautiful eyes glanced at the corpse of the maid called Xiaohuan. Seeing her tragic state, Qin Yu’s already pale face turned even whiter.

“Young lady…” Lin Yun smiled brightly, putting on a suave air and was about to greet Qin Yu when the middle-aged man glared at him fiercely: “Step back! Haven’t you caused enough trouble?”

Lin Yun seemed somewhat afraid of the middle-aged man. Hearing this, he looked embarrassed and fell silent.

The other disciples of the Eight Directions Sect all looked at him with blame, clearly fed up with his lack of restraint.

“This must be Miss Qin Yu?” The middle-aged man cupped his fists from afar and smiled at Qin Yu.

“Senior recognizes me?” Qin Yu coughed a few times, her gaze gentle as she looked at him.

The middle-aged man smiled and said, “When I was gathering information in the city, I often heard people mention that the Qin Family had an extraordinary young lady. Now that I see you, your reputation is well deserved.”

Though only at the Origin Returning Realm and gravely ill with dim life force, she could still speak calmly to a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm expert. This was not something an ordinary girl could do. Yet, looking at Qin Yu, the man saw no fear or panic in her eyes.

Most importantly, the man could sense that Qin Yu’s life was nearly at its end. But she showed no fear, her expression calm. Even elders who had lived for centuries might not face death so serenely.

The middle-aged man couldn’t help but look at Qin Yu with newfound respect.

“Miss Yu, do you mean the Source Crystals offered are too few?” Although he found her impressive, he didn’t take her too seriously. She was only at the Origin Returning Realm and just a young lady of a small family. After a brief exchange, he got straight to the point, smiling, “If so, you can name your price. The Eight Directions Sect isn’t a great Sect, but we can afford several hundred thousand Source Crystals.”

As soon as he finished, Qin Yu coldly interrupted, “Do you think this is a business deal? Something to bargain over?”

The middle-aged man’s expression stiffened, and he gave a dry laugh. “Then, Miss Yu, what do you mean…?”

“Life is priceless!” Qin Yu shouted.

The man’s eyes narrowed, and his tone turned cold. “Miss Yu, you’d better speak plainly. I’m having trouble understanding.”

He was losing patience. Though Lin Yun had caused this, as a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, he had already lowered himself and tried to mediate, hoping the other side would be sensible. But the Qin Family, both old and young, refused to compromise, which infuriated him.

Given the vast difference in strength, he felt he had already given them immense face by negotiating. Yet they repeatedly refused to accept, making him lose face as well.

“A life for a life! That is only right and proper!” Qin Yu shouted.

“What?” The man’s face changed. He hadn’t expected Qin Yu to make such an outrageous demand.

Lin Yun was even more shocked, jumping up and shouting, “You little bitch, are you insane? You want me to pay with my life? How can the life of a worthless maid compare to mine? Do you want to die?”

“Watch your filthy mouth! Did you eat shit or something?” Qin Chaoyang’s fury erupted as soon as he heard this brat dare insult Qin Yu, and he immediately shot back with a curse of his own.

Lin Yun, enraged, laughed instead, nodding repeatedly. “Good, good! For such a small family, you all have guts. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson!”

As he spoke, he roused his Origin Qi, clearly about to make a move.

“Bastard!” the middle-aged man suddenly shouted at Lin Yun, gritting his teeth. “What do you think you’re doing?”

Lin Yun was stunned, pointing at Qin Chaoyang and Qin Yu. “You heard what they said! Isn’t it obvious what I want to do?”

The man’s face darkened, and he secretly transmitted, “Killing them is nothing. Even if word gets out, at most it’s a loss of face for the Sect. No one will stand up for a small family like this or come looking for trouble with the Eight Directions Sect.”

“Then what are you worried about?” Lin Yun couldn’t understand why he was being stopped.

“Do you want to alarm that person? Do you know what will happen to you if you do?” The man looked at him coldly.

Hearing this, Lin Yun’s face changed. The “person” the man referred to was clearly terrifying—just hearing about him made Lin Yun’s face turn pale and his aura collapse.

Qin Yu and Qin Chaoyang saw this exchange but had no idea what the two from the Eight Directions Sect were secretly discussing that made Lin Yun back down.

Only then did the man look at Qin Yu and cup his fists. “Miss Yu, I can pretend I didn’t hear your earlier suggestion. Please make another.”

Qin Yu coughed a few times and said, “I know that with the Qin Family’s strength, we can’t make you pay with your life…”

“Miss Yu, you are indeed reasonable.” The man smiled, praising her sensibility.

Qin Yu continued, “But Xiaohuan was a servant of the Qin Family. She cannot die so unjustly. Since we cannot avenge her, we cannot allow her killer to remain in the Qin Family. You… leave!”

At these words, all the Eight Directions Sect members were stunned, their eyes wide as they stared at Qin Yu in shock.

The man was silent for a long time before coughing dryly. “Miss Yu, what do you mean by that?”

Qin Yu said, “Isn’t it clear? The Qin Family will no longer host you, but we will remember this grudge. One day, we will avenge Xiaohuan.”

As she spoke, she looked the man straight in the eye, not flinching at all.

The man’s face grew colder and colder, and the other disciples of the Eight Directions Sect looked no better.

A breeze blew, making the scent of blood in the courtyard even stronger.

The man stared sharply at Qin Yu for a long time before finally speaking. “Miss Yu… are you serious?”

As he spoke, the corner of his mouth twitched. He hadn’t expected things to come to this.

If they were really driven out by Qin Yu, what face would the Eight Directions Sect have left? More importantly, if they were expelled, it would surely alarm that person he dreaded. How would he explain it then?

He couldn’t possibly tell that person that Lin Yun had killed a maid, and because the Qin Family couldn’t get revenge, they kicked them out…

If he said that, he and Lin Yun would both be finished.

That person… was not someone to reason with.

“Do I look like I’m joking?” Qin Yu bit her red lip, not backing down at all.

The man suddenly closed his eyes and said slowly, “Miss Yu, can’t this be reconsidered? We cannot leave the Qin Family for now, for reasons I cannot explain.”

Before Qin Yu could reply, he suddenly raised a finger. “One million Source Crystals! How about that?”

At these words, Lin Yun and the others turned pale and cried out, “Senior Brother, are you serious?”

One million Source Crystals was no small sum. The Eight Directions Sect was not a great Sect, and while they could afford it, it would be a heavy blow. Unless absolutely necessary, they would never pay so much.

At this, Lin Yun shouted, “It was just a servant—so what if she was killed? Enough with all this nonsense! I’ll give you a hundred thousand Source Crystals, take it or leave it. As for the Qin Family, we’re not leaving. If you really have the guts, come seek revenge on me anytime you like!”
