## Chapter 158 — Departure

Yang Kai lowered his head and discovered that the pendant was merely a square piece of jade. However, it felt cool to the touch and had a calming effect.

"This is a piece of Ice Jade Essence. I have worn it since I was young, and over the years, it has absorbed quite a bit of my True Yuan. Keep it close to you; at a critical moment, it will help suppress the turmoil of your primordial energy."

"Does this count as a token of affection or something similar?" Yang Kai looked at Su Yan and smiled.

Su Yan's cheeks flushed slightly as she nodded gently.

Hearing this, Yang Kai hurriedly began to search himself, but after a long while, he found nothing of value to give.

The most precious items he had were the Soul-Breaking Spike and the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng.

He couldn't give away the Soul-Breaking Spike; it was too sinister, and it contained the soul of an Earth Demon, which would only harm Su Yan if given to her. The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng could be given, but it was merely a spiritual herb and lacked the significance of a token.

He awkwardly sniffed and said, "I'll get you something similar in the future."

Su Yan smiled, "The Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew you gave me is enough."

"You are truly wonderful!" Yang Kai said sincerely.

"Don't praise me too much; if you do, my heart will race!" Su Yan gasped, covering her chest. After practicing the Dual Cultivation Technique, her Ice Heart Technique had no effect when facing Yang Kai. He seemed to be her nemesis, with every word and action pulling at her heartstrings.

"Hehe!" Yang Kai laughed joyfully. Who in the world could make a woman like Su Yan feel flustered? Only he could!

Life was thus; what more could one ask for?

It could be said that without the fortuitous encounter in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, Yang Kai would likely never have had much interaction with Su Yan in his lifetime. And among the entire Han Dynasty, there was not a single man worthy of her. Even he, Yang Kai, felt somewhat unworthy of Su Yan. This was not self-deprecation, but rather, Su Yan was too proud and noble.

"Now that we are out of here, what do you plan to do?" Su Yan calmed herself and asked another question.

"What do you mean by 'what to do'?"

"The path ahead!" Su Yan spoke as if she were a responsible parent, considering matters Yang Kai had never thought of, "And our relationship."

"I don't understand," Yang Kai frowned. "Please be more clear."

Su Yan smiled gently, "Let me put it this way: I have thought of two paths for you. The first is to make our relationship public. With my status and position in the sect, once our relationship is known, you will certainly receive strong support from the sect. You won’t have to worry about Contribution Points anymore, and in the future, martial skills, pills, and secret treasures will all be easily attainable."

"Are you testing me?" Yang Kai looked at Su Yan with a smile.

She slowly shook her head, "I am serious."

Yang Kai couldn't help but be moved. He could imagine the uproar that would ensue within the sect if his relationship with Su Yan were made public.

He and Su Yan were like the underground and the heavens, a pair that was fundamentally impossible to unite. If they were to appear openly before the world, Yang Kai would naturally be envied, and Su Yan's situation would not be any better. Not to mention the obstacles from their elders, even their fellow disciples would surely scorn Su Yan's choice.

Yang Kai did not expect Su Yan to face the rumors of the world with such calmness.

"You don’t need to feel any psychological burden. I am merely creating cultivation conditions for my man!"

Yang Kai came back to his senses and said seriously, "This proposal is very tempting, but it’s not suitable for me."

Su Yan seemed to know he would say this, her expression calm. She looked at him with a smile.

Yang Kai clenched his fists, staring at them as he said, "Everything I have will be fought for by myself. Relying on you is not what I want."

Su Yan smiled brightly, "Although it saddens me to hear you say that, I am also very happy. Then you can only take the second path."

Yang Kai laughed, "Yes, I will grow stronger as soon as possible!"

The second path was to rely on himself!

"I'll be waiting for you to protect me!" Su Yan said softly.

"It won't be long," Yang Kai took Su Yan's hand and kissed it. After a pause, he suddenly remembered something and looked up, "By the way, Su Yan, after we leave this time, you might encounter some trouble."

"En?" Su Yan looked puzzled.

Yang Kai analyzed seriously, "The disciples from our three sects came here for the inheritance. We need to kill nine demon beasts to activate the formation and reveal the inheritance. With seven or eight hundred disciples from the three sects who have climbed those endless stairs and experienced the trials of cold and heat, your strength is the strongest among them, and you practice a cold attribute technique. What do you think those people are thinking right now?"

Su Yan was taken aback. She had only been considering Yang Kai's matters and hadn't thought about her own situation. But upon hearing Yang Kai's words, she suddenly realized, "They will think that the inheritance here has already been obtained by me!"

"Exactly. I estimate that many people think this way," Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Su Yan smiled confidently, "Let them think whatever they want. Even if I did obtain the inheritance, I don’t need to explain anything to them."

"Best not to admit it! Don’t admit it to anyone! This is a serious matter. I feel that the appearance of the Inheritance Celestial Cave will not only involve these three sects nearby!"

Upon hearing this, Su Yan also became serious. She could disregard the experts from the nearby three sects, but she absolutely could not ignore the experts from the entire Han Dynasty. Once someone targeted the inheritor of the legacy, Su Yan would only face endless trouble.

She nodded heavily, "I understand."

Feeling somewhat relieved, it was good for the three sects to focus all their attention on her. This way, Yang Kai would not be suspected. Everyone thought that the inheritance could only be obtained by one person, but they did not expect that this time, the inheritance would be shared by two.

She looked at Yang Kai with admiration, "You think so far ahead."

Yang Kai smiled bitterly, "I’m just used to seeing how those large powers operate and their methods of coercion and subjugation."

Su Yan stared at him blankly. His words carried a sense of weariness, and she suddenly felt that this junior brother had many secrets.

"I'll tell you later!" Yang Kai patted Su Yan's hand.

"En, it's fine if you don’t say anything," Su Yan nodded.

"Alright, let’s go. There’s nothing left here." Yang Kai stood up. The great hall was very empty. Apart from the massive energy sphere from before, there was nothing else.

After the two obtained the inheritance, a light curtain appeared again, presumably to transport them out.

Holding Su Yan's hand, Yang Kai plunged into the light curtain.

As their figures disappeared from the great hall, a crisp cracking sound suddenly echoed throughout the Inheritance Celestial Cave, as if a mirror had fallen to the ground and shattered.

Immediately, the chaotic world revealed intersecting cracks. The disciples of the three sects still remaining in the Inheritance Celestial Cave were all startled. They had no idea what had happened.

Just as they were at a loss, an unknown energy surged in, enveloping them and slowly lifting them toward the sky.

In the Blood Battle Gang's mining area, since the day the Inheritance Celestial Cave opened, the experts from the three sects had been stationed there, anxiously waiting.

Now, nearly a month had passed, and many disciples had gradually emerged from the Inheritance Celestial Cave. These individuals were either injured and could no longer persist or were simply exhausted and no longer wished to stay inside.

From their accounts, the experts of the three sects had learned some information about the situation inside.

Especially in recent days, as some disciples appeared, the expressions of the three sects' experts grew increasingly worried and anxious. They had received news that the inheritance had appeared, but they did not know who would ultimately obtain it.

Every sect was filled with high expectations for their rising stars, yet they were also filled with anxiety.

Su Yan and Jie Hongchen from Lingxiao Pavilion, Hu Jiao’er and Long Jun from the Blood Battle Gang, and Fang Ziqi from Fengyu Tower were all outstanding figures of the younger generation.

There was also the mad old man's female disciple, Xia Ningshang from Lingxiao Pavilion, who might also obtain the inheritance.

However, that mad old man was quite carefree. After waiting for several days at the Inheritance Celestial Cave and seeing that his disciple had not come out, he left alone and has not appeared since.

Irresponsible master! The experts of the three sects all secretly cursed Meng Wuya.

Because of the existence of the inheritance, a subtle atmosphere of hostility and competition spread among the experts of the three sects, especially among the Blood Battle Gang.

They condemned the robbery of Lingxiao Pavilion and Fengyu Tower while cursing Meng Wuya's unreasonable behavior! If it weren’t for the latter's battle with the Blood Battle Gang's experts that day, how could the existence of the Inheritance Celestial Cave have been exposed so early?

This was originally the wealth of the Blood Battle Gang! Now, it had been forcefully inserted by the other two sects. Although there was compensation, that little compensation was nothing compared to the inheritance of a powerful expert!

Damn it! Hu Man had been cursing so much these days that his lips had blistered, but he didn’t dare to curse Meng Wuya; he was cursing Long Zaitian and Long Hui instead!

If it weren’t for that damned little beast provoking Meng Wuya, how could there be so much trouble? Die, die well! If it weren’t for your early death, I would have torn you to pieces by now! The Long family, what are they worth?!

Not only did Hu Man despise the Long family now, but the other experts of the Blood Battle Gang were also filled with grievances because of this matter. Long Zaitian, knowing he was in the wrong, had been severely injured by Meng Wuya a month ago and had not dared to show his face in the mining area, hiding within the Blood Battle Gang to heal.

But the hatred from the death of the little grandson was not something that could be easily resolved.

One day, I will make you pay in blood for your blood debts! Long Zaitian silently vowed.

Just as the experts of the three sects were anxiously waiting, the light curtain of the Inheritance Celestial Cave suddenly trembled, as if a stone had been thrown into a calm lake, creating ripples.

The next moment, the light curtain burst apart like a bubble, disappearing completely and revealing the mining vein beneath the large pit.

"Where are the people?" Hu Man suddenly panicked. The entrance to the Inheritance Celestial Cave had vanished, but not a single disciple from the three sects had appeared. His two daughters were still inside; where had they gone?

Not only was Hu Man anxious, but every expert was equally worried. The elite disciples of the younger generation had all entered the Inheritance Celestial Cave, yet now not a single one had emerged.

Just as they were worried, a cry of despair suddenly came from not far away.

An elder from Fengyu Tower's expression changed, and he hurriedly rushed over.
