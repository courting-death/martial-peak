## Chapter 1366 — Blind to What Lies Before One's Eyes

"Oh? Your sect still has a senior who hasn't arrived?" Yang Kai arched a brow.

"Naturally. Our Senior Uncle is currently resting in Tianyun City; we merely sought a suitable place first. Now that arrangements are set, I'll send word to him!"

Saying so, the leading martial brother produced his sect's Communication Compass and slipped his Divine Sense into it, conversing with someone unknown.

Yang Kai made no move to stop him, only smiling as he watched; when the man finally withdrew his compass, Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and asked, "Finding lodging shouldn't be a problem. The Dragon Lair Mountain has many pavilions and fine scenery; its Spiritual Qi is excellent—surely it suits you all."

"Heh heh, we picked this little mountain because the Spiritual Qi is good—otherwise why would I have waited here for days?" The lead man bobbed his head arrogantly. "With Haixin Sect's strength, we could have gone to nearby clans; they'd undoubtedly roll out the red carpet. Kid, your luck has come. My Senior Uncle may have a sour temper, but he's generous; if you please him this time, you won't come away empty-handed."

"Really?" Yang Kai brightened, visibly excited. "You came from afar—should I prepare a banquet to welcome you?"

“Mm, at least you have some sense. We’re not ones to be greedy for food or drink—it doesn’t matter whether there’s any or not. But my Senior Uncle happens to be quite the connoisseur in that regard, so let’s do as you said. Just don’t bring out any ordinary fare; my Senior Uncle wouldn’t even look at it!” Seeing how effective his Senior Uncle’s name was, the cultivator immediately began waving that banner high, tossing out “Senior Uncle” with every other word as though he were the old man’s very tapeworm.

“Yes, yes, of course!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. “By the way, may I ask, besides this particular fondness, does that senior from your esteemed sect have any other preferences?”

"Other preferences?" The Haixin Sect man raised an eyebrow and smiled knowingly. "You mean…"

"Heh heh!" Yang Kai grinned wickedly, both of them wearing the guilty look of conspirators.

Daiyuan standing nearby was utterly speechless. She had never known Yang Kai could behave like this; she also saw clearly he was merely teasing, yet the man across from them took it as earnest flattery and groveling—an absurd sight.

"Good, good, you really know how to handle things," the man laughed, leaning close to Yang Kai's ear to whisper a few lecherous words.

Yang Kai raised his brow and beamed. "Is that so? Then that's easy—our Dragon Lair Mountain may lack much, but we have plenty of beauties."

At those words, many of the male disciples from Haixin Sect revealed looks of delight. The leading man added, “Good, that will do. But before that, I’ll have to inspect them first—can’t have you trying to bluff your way through with subpar goods and spoil my Senior Uncle’s mood.”

"No problem!" Yang Kai slapped his chest, dragging Daiyuan before him and pointing at her. "Friend, what do you think of this young lady?"

Daiyuan flushed with shame and anger, glaring venomously at Yang Kai. She hadn't heard exactly what he'd said, but with both of them looking so lecherous, it was obvious it concerned beauty.

Though she had regained her peerless looks, being dragged out like this by Yang Kai still irritated her.

The Haixin Sect man paused, glanced at Daiyuan, and the smile drained from his face; cold light flickered in his eyes as he sneered, "Kid, are you joking? Is this even a woman?"

Daiyuan's pretty face went even colder.

"I'm not joking!" Yang Kai said lightly. "This young lady is ethereally beautiful—her looks could topple a nation. Can't you see it?"

Hearing him, Daiyuan couldn't help but glare at him, yet her anger faded.

Others didn't know that beneath this ugly visage lay her true appearance; Yang Kai did, so when he praised her, there was no insincerity—only utter composure and a wholly genuine smile.

"You have no other girls here?" the Haixin Sect man asked, still reluctant to accept it.

"There are others, but none match her," Yang Kai shook his head.

The Haixin Sect men fell silent. The leader's face darkened as he forced a smile. "Kid, are you serious?"

"Do I look like I'm joking?" Yang Kai's smile lifted at the corner as he squinted at him.

The man finally realized he was being toyed with; the earlier adulation and flattery revealed as mere pretense, he flew into a rage and roared, "Kid, you're courting death!"

With that, he lunged at Yang Kai without another word.

His cultivation stood at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and he was an elite disciple of Haixin Sect; he believed dealing with someone like Yang Kai would be effortless and thus had looked down on him.

A great hand reached out, Saint Yuan roaring across the palm, fierce and overwhelming; the gathered Spiritual Qi twisted and condensed into a gleaming blue giant palm, crashing down toward Yang Kai.

Haixin Sect was based on the Wuyou Sea, so its disciples cultivated predominantly water techniques and martial skills, aided by local advantage to accelerate their training.

The blue watery palm enveloped Yang Kai and Daiyuan in an instant, its might poised to strike.

At that moment, a flash of golden light streaked across the air, scattering dazzling beams; in the blink of an eye the blue palm burst like a fragile bubble.

The Haixin Sect cultivator’s expression changed drastically. Even as he shouted “Not good!” his Divine Sense surged, driving his Secret Treasure into motion.

In that brief exchange, he realized Yang Kai differed from the Saint King warriors he'd met before, so he dared not be negligent and immediately tried to unleash his treasure's power.

But the next instant the golden light drew in, forming a glittering golden thread that shot toward him.

Quick to react, the man flicked out finger strikes to sever the thread, but the golden strand seemed alive—dodging every attack and, in a flash, coiling around him.

Feeling the mortal danger radiating from the thread, cold sweat beaded on his brow; he dared not move and bellowed, "Everyone stop!"

The Haixin Sect disciples behind him, about to launch their assault, hastily retracted their Saint Yuan at the shout, staring with mouths agape.

This Senior Brother was Haixin Sect's top Saint King; in sect sparring none could best him, and the sect leader and elders praised him while junior disciples admired him.

Yet such a man had been subdued by a fellow Saint King from a little mountain in one move, utterly powerless to resist.

Some Haixin Sect disciples even rubbed their eyes in disbelief, confirming they hadn't misseen: their proud senior was indeed ensnared by a golden thread, life hanging by a thread.

With Yang Kai's current means, dealing with an equal was child's play; it required little effort.

With a light snort, Yang Kai tugged the Haixin Sect man forward and delivered a single slap.

Crack—his foe's head snapped aside; blood and a broken teeth flew out, his cheek instantly swelling into a high welt.

He seemed stunned by the blow, dazed for a long moment.

Yang Kai flicked his hand as if discarding something dirty and looked at him coolly, "Do you know why I hit you?"

The Haixin Sect man shook his head instinctively.

Crack—another sharp smack, his other cheek puffed up.

Yang Kai sniffed and said flatly, "Because you're blind to what's right before your eyes!"

The Haixin cultivator snapped back to his senses and hastily nodded. “Yes, yes! I, Hai, was blind and failed to recognize your exalted self. I beg you, sir, to spare me!”

“Heh heh!” Yang Kai let out a lukewarm chuckle, raising his palm—broad as a fan—and waved it beside the Haixin cultivator’s cheek before slapping him again. “Not that one,” he said evenly. “Think harder!”

After taking three consecutive slaps—though Yang Kai hadn’t used his full strength—the Haixin cultivator still felt his head spinning, stars dancing before his eyes, and the taste of blood filling his mouth and nose. He stammered repeatedly, “It was I, Hai, who failed to know my place and foolishly sought to requisition your land!”

"Still not it!" Yang Kai slapped again.

The Haixin Sect men gaped, while their leader seemed to have lost all hope; Yang Kai said he was blind to the obvious, and he could only come up with those two reasons—both wrong—but bound by the golden thread he dared not resist. This shameful scene would ruin his prestige in Haixin Sect.

His thoughts whirled rapidly, and perhaps by a stroke of desperate inspiration, the Haixin cultivator suddenly widened his eyes and looked toward Daiyuan. “It was I, Hai, who failed to see clearly,” he exclaimed. “To think I could not recognize the peerless beauty of this young lady—enchanting enough to turn all living beings upside down!”

Daiyuan's cheeks colored slightly; although the compliment was unwarranted, the shameless praise still left her a little bashful.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and smiled, "Not bad, not bad—so your eyes aren't entirely useless. If you say another wrong thing, I might just pluck your eyes out."

Cold sweat poured from the man as he forced himself to heap praise upon Daiyuan—how she put flowers to shame and eclipsed the moon—praise that felt nearly nauseating to utter, yet facing Daiyuan's current ugly face he managed a torrent of compliments, something few could do.

Yang Kai felt gooseflesh rise all over.

"Yang Kai!" Daiyuan stamped her foot, unable to bear it; though she knew he was merely finding an excuse to teach the man a lesson, those flowery praises sounded unbearable.

"I know," Yang Kai nodded gently, about to release the man when his brow furrowed and he looked up toward the sky.

Over in the distance, a streak of radiant light shot rapidly toward them. The person had yet to arrive, but their Divine Sense had already swept ahead. Upon sensing what was happening here, an enraged shout thundered through the air: “Who dares to insult my disciple!”
