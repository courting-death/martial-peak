## Chapter 690 — Do I Get a Share Too?

The Soul Devouring Worms most delight in devouring Divine Sense power, while the Warm Spirit Lotus was constantly emanating wondrous energy, nourishing Yang Kai's Divine Sense.

Once those ancient exotic insects fell onto Five-Colored Treasure Island, they all stirred as if roused, as though they had entered a cozy nest they greatly favored and no longer wished to leave.

This unexpected result was not part of Yang Kai's calculations, but it was a welcome outcome.

If properly controlled, those ancient insects would not harm him; Yang Kai could even use his Divine Sense power to cultivate them, strengthen them, and release them to meet an enemy when the time came.

Having taken in the Soul Devouring Worms, Yang Kai gained an additional layer of security.

Although his physical cultivation still stood only at the peak of the Divine Roaming Stage, not yet having reached the Transcendent Stage, when it came to a contest of Divine Sense power, Yang Kai felt he need not fear a Saint Stage powerhouse.

The Divine Sense Fire and the Soul Devouring Worms could both be deployed outward to assist; the Golden Pupil Eye could only function within the Sea of Consciousness, but if some strong opponent overestimated themselves and shoved their soul into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, they would never come back.

With one more safeguard, Yang Kai felt considerably more at ease.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai did not remain in place to wait; instead he strode outward.

He intended to collect all the ancient exotic insects still alive within the Seas of Consciousness of the Tianxiao Sect disciples.

Only about four or five of those people were still alive; if left alone they would surely die, and even the sect's Founder would likely be helpless regarding their condition.

Yang Kai's motive was selfish in origin, but if he succeeded he could also save them and thereby curry favor with the strong figures of the Tianxiao Sect—a win-win.

With no burden on his conscience, Yang Kai acted with extreme boldness.

Inside the bronze gate, Cang Yan and Fei Yu had rushed in and proceeded ever deeper, constantly searching for hidden treasures.

They did find some spoils and both looked visibly exhilarated.

"Cang Yan, I just remembered—the Founder sent me out on a mission at this time, and we happened to meet you bringing that kid back; this can't be a coincidence, can it?" Fei Yu seemed to have perceived something, asking as she continued searching.

"It shouldn't be a coincidence." Cang Yan nodded. "Probably the Founder wanted to use this opportunity to probe that young man's character."

"Did you know from the beginning?" Fei Yu looked at Cang Yan with a light, teasing smile.

"Of course. The moment I heard about Soul Devouring Worms I understood the Founder's intent. Only Divine Sense Fire can handle Soul Devouring Worms—what a coincidence that I happened to bring back someone who possesses Divine Sense Fire?" Cang Yan said in a low voice. "If I hadn't brought him back, the Founder definitely wouldn't have sent you to handle this."

"So it seems the Founder still didn't know what that kid was truly like. Why would the Founder seek him out?"

"I haven't figured that out either. More than two months ago the Founder suddenly ordered me to find him; I spent a great deal of effort to track him down." Cang Yan frowned. "Besides, he doesn't even know the Founder."

"Strange—our Founder is always so inscrutable." Fei Yu puckered her mouth. "But since you've already seen through the Founder's plan and still dare to use it as leverage to bargain with me, you're shameless; then the Thousand Red Flower Wine isn't for you."

At that remark, Cang Yan's expression turned wry.

"Divine Sense Fire, intriguing..." Fei Yu murmured with a smile.

"He's also a Spirit-Grade alchemist," Cang Yan added.

Fei Yu's frame trembled slightly. "You mean it?"

"I believe this may be why the Founder sent me to find him. This kid has boundless prospects—I'm eager to see him stir up a commotion on Tongxuan Continent and become someone on par with Tianzang Elder."

"If that's the case, I must cultivate closeness with him—talents like that are rare." Fei Yu finally grew serious; until now she had somewhat underestimated Yang Kai.

"And I sense his potential goes far beyond that; there are many mysteries about him. With his current performance and proper nurturing, he might truly surpass the young prodigies from the continent's top powers and become the most dazzling new star."

"A person favored by the Founder will not be mediocre," Fei Yu agreed.

The two secretly resolved that before Yang Kai's edge fully revealed itself, they would cultivate good relations with him; when he later rode the wind and waves and transformed into a dragon or ascended to godhood, it would greatly benefit them.

After roughly a day and night, Yang Kai finally saw Cang Yan and Fei Yu emerge from behind that bronze gate.

Both wore expressions of joy; it was clear their gains had been substantial.

Seeing Yang Kai sitting cross-legged waiting quietly, with four or five easily breathing Tianxiao Sect disciples lying beside him, Cang Yan and Fei Yu could not hide their astonishment.

"Eh, being idle I tried to disperse the Soul Devouring Worms in their Seas of Consciousness; unexpectedly it was easy. These people should recover within a year or half a year," Yang Kai explained.

"Skilled," Cang Yan's eyes brightened as he praised aloud.

Before this, he and Fei Yu had not bothered with the disciples' life-or-death, merely administering pills because they didn't know how to handle the matter and thought the odds slim; they had not expected Yang Kai to give them a pleasant surprise.

"Big sister is liking you more and more." Fei Yu smiled coquettishly. "You are the lifesaver of these disciples; rest assured, sister will not treat you unfairly."

Yang Kai shrugged and said nonchalantly, "Are you all recovered?"

"Yes." Cang Yan smiled faintly, then suddenly produced several items and set them before Yang Kai, calling, "Look—take whatever you want; these are what Fei Yu and I found inside. Unfortunately, most things have turned to dust with the years."

"Do I get a share?" Yang Kai pointed to himself and asked in surprise.

"Of course you do—did you think we'd hog everything?" Fei Yu giggled. "If not for you, we wouldn't have even gotten through the gate, let alone searched for treasures; you also saved several disciples of our sect, so by all accounts you are the greatest contributor."

"Then I won't be polite." Yang Kai smiled slightly, his gaze sweeping over the few items before him.

Cang Yan and Fei Yu exchanged a glance and secretly nodded, thinking this kid remained unfazed by favor or disgrace—truly a notable person.

If it had been other young people, in front of the two they would never have spoken like this; they would have yielded repeatedly, preferring to give up immediate benefits to leave a good impression.

Knowing when to strike—decisive!

Placed before Yang Kai were five items: three Secret Treasures, one cultivation manual, and a fist-sized pitch-black stone.

These were indeed all the usable items Cang Yan and Fei Yu had found inside; they had not concealed anything in this matter.

Of the three Secret Treasures, even the least was a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level; the remaining two were Saint-Grade Secret Treasures, their value incalculable.

Even mighty figures like Cang Yan and Fei Yu had never owned a Saint-Grade Secret Treasure.

The manual, too, was a decent formula, of Spirit-Grade Upper-Level quality.

Yang Kai examined them one by one, his gaze finally lingering on the pitch-black stone; it was smooth and round with no discernible material, and when Yang Kai poured in True Yuan there was no response, while probing with his Divine Sense revealed nothing.

"What is this?" Yang Kai asked the two.

Cang Yan and Fei Yu both shook their heads; they knew nothing about the stone either, only that it had been placed in a very concealed spot and they had taken it out casually.

"Then I'll take this." Yang Kai said with a smile.

Cang Yan frowned and said solemnly, "You should choose a Secret Treasure for protection. You probably can't make full use of a Saint-Grade's might—your cultivation is insufficient to drive its full power and it might even backfire—whereas that Spirit-Grade Upper-Level one is quite good."

"Yes, you don't have to be so modest." Fei Yu also looked puzzled; she had just thought this kid decisive, so why the sudden change of manner?

She didn't like it at all.

Choosing an unknown stone looked like a loss no matter how one viewed it.

"I'm not being modest!" Yang Kai chuckled. "Since you can't discern its origin, it either has no value or is extremely precious. If I take it, I might end up profiting more than you."

"You're gambling," Cang Yan disagreed. "Realized benefit is the true benefit."

"Since it appeared here and you carried it out, there is a good chance it is valuable; you two are not without discernment." Yang Kai smiled and pocketed the pitch-black stone. "I don't need a Secret Treasure, nor the manual—this is mine."

"If you're so insistent, we won't argue. If you later find you've lost out, don't come crying." Fei Yu snorted and ceased persuading; she and Cang Yan then divided the remaining four items in Yang Kai's presence.

The Saint-Grade Secret Treasures were split one apiece; the Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure and the manual were each taken by one of them.

With gains in hand, Cang Yan and Fei Yu were exceptionally pleased.

"Let's go—the Founder should be waiting." Cang Yan said, casually picking up two unconscious disciples and leading the way out.

Fei Yu also grabbed two and mouthed at Yang Kai, "You take the last one; I purposely left you a beauty, don't worry too much—she should be unclaimed, so while she's unconscious feel free to take advantage."

She spoke with an ambiguous look, as if she understood everything he might be thinking.

Yang Kai laughed awkwardly, slung the last Tianxiao Sect female disciple onto his back, and followed them out.

Retracing their route, the three used their movement techinques to ascend and soon returned to the mountainside.

After confirming the direction, Cang Yan said nothing and flew straight toward the location of the Tianxiao Sect.

Yang Kai and Fei Yu hurried to keep up.

Within about an hour, the three arrived above a vast valley; looking down, scattered houses lay below and many martial artists were active in the valley.
