## Chapter 430 — You Join In Too!

In front of the central hall, Ying Jiu appeared like a phantom. After slaying three men, he swiftly vanished. Yang Shen’s subordinates no longer dared act recklessly. One by one they turned back, their faces showing grim relief as they directed their questioning gazes toward him.

Yang Shen’s expression was gloomy to the extreme, his entire chest swelling with anger. He no longer dared issue commands recklessly.

Yang Zhao, however, frowned deeply, silently brooding within.

Ying Jiu had not unleashed the Blood Fury Technique, yet was still so formidable. Given his injuries, there was absolutely no reason for him to be this strong. Before coming, Yang Zhao had made inquiries and learned that Ying Jiu and Qu Gaoyi, both elites within the Blood Servants Hall, were gravely injured. Any Divine Roaming Realm Master at the Sixth Stage should easily defeat them.

Could his injuries have really healed completely?

Or had he used some special method to suppress them?

Yang Zhao was greatly perplexed, curiously pondering the situation.

Looking again at Qu Gaoyi, not a word had passed his lips from start to finish. His body hadn’t moved at all except for the occasional flick of his eyes—this Blood Servant was like a corpse.

Surrounded by four or five men, Qu Gaoyi's expression was utterly unchanged, as indifferent as still water.

Suddenly, Yang Zhao felt an intense headache.

Although Yang Shen and Yang Zhao’s troops were formidable, if they wished to seize the command flag under the noses of two Blood Servants at their peak, they would be taking an enormous risk.

The biggest question now was just how much strength the two Blood Servants stationed at Yang Kai’s residence could truly unleash.

If they were merely bluffing, Yang Zhao still had confidence that Yang Kai would be eliminated tonight. But if not...

After mulling it over for a long moment, Yang Zhao snorted coldly, “Sixth Brother, it seems you can’t handle the command flag.”

Yang Shen's face grew ice cold, not denying this.

“In that case, Second Brother will lend you a hand,” Yang Zhao said solemnly, gazing downward.

This opportunity tonight was rare; Yang Zhao did not want to miss it. Though knowing his decision was somewhat reckless, he could not suppress the eagerness stirring in his heart.

“I appreciate the help, but the command flag’s ownership...” Yang Shen had suffered a loss once before and was finally a bit smarter, knowing to ask clearly.

“We’ll talk about that when the time comes,” Yang Zhao responded. He was not one to do a bad deal. Yang Kai’s current whereabouts were unknown, and if he consented rashly to give up the command flag, he might end up with nothing.

Yang Shen frowned but did not argue over Yang Zhao’s flip-flopping. After some silence, he finally nodded, “Fine.”

Having lost four skilled fighters at once, Yang Shen was desperate to win a victory and salvage the situation.

“Then let’s go,” Yang Zhao chuckled softly, waving his hand.

Behind him, two Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage experts brought by Ye Xinrou of the Ye Family moved out, alongside experts from the Xiang and Nan families. Yang Shen also gave a glance toward his own men.

In an instant, the two brothers joined forces. Over ten Divine Roaming Realm warriors pressed toward the central hall, accompanied by several True Essence Realm martial artists.

“Hey, hey! Let me make it clear—I’m just here to watch, don’t drag me into this!” Huo Xingchen shouted, stepping back a few steps on his own accord.

Qiu Yimeng sneered coldly, delivering a kick to his rear that sent him stumbling forward. She and Xiang Tianxiao stepped forward together.

Suddenly, the Autumn Rain Hall and Xiang Tianxiao’s troops appeared like ghosts from all around. Their numbers were considerable, although few were true elites.

Yang Zhao and Yang Shen’s troops pressed steadily onward toward the central hall without fear.

Qu Gaoyi, who had remained unmoving, suddenly roared angrily. A wild true essence erupted from his body, while an invisible wave of energy spread in all directions. His voice thundered near each ear, “Want to enter the central hall? You must pass me first!”

His energy was brimming, showing no sign of injury.

Already on edge from Ying Jiu’s ambush, Yang Shen and Yang Zhao’s troops grew nervous at Qu Gaoyi’s roar. Some with weaker composure even launched a spectral beam at Qu Gaoyi.

Qu Gaoyi easily deflected it with a casual flick, grinning ferociously.

Bound by clan rules, Blood Servants can only counterattack, never initiating. Now that he was attacked, Qu Gaoyi had no hesitation in exerting his full power.

His form suddenly turned into a blue flash, reappearing amid the enemy ranks in the next moment.

Regarded as the fiercest and most tenacious of the Blood Servants Hall’s elite, Qu Gaoyi was most proficient in short bursts of devastating power!

He could expend all of his true essence and divine sense energy in one incense stick’s time without reserve or remnant. During that short window, few could withstand his assault.

Streams of divine sense power burst forth visibly from his mind. Powerful soul techniques erupted around him like thunder. Seals formed with his hands, unleashing exquisite and lethal martial skills with deadly precision.

In an instant, chaos exploded. Bodies collapsed and fell in confusion.

No one expected this injured Blood Servant to dare charge the crowd while recklessly attacking with no defense.

Within three breaths, several fell dead, their bodies even exploding mid-air into dust, leaving no bones behind.

Yang Zhao, Yang Shen, Xiang Chu, Nan Sheng, and Qiu Ziru’s eyes trembled fiercely.

None had anticipated the ferocity with which the battle would erupt.

By contrast, the two Blood Servants beside the Yang brothers exchanged knowing smiles.

With their insight, they easily discerned Qu Gaoyi was fully healed; otherwise he couldn’t have unleashed such powerful combat strength.

How did he recover? When they met him in the daytime, he was still as injured as ever. How could such a huge change occur in just one day? This puzzled the two Blood Servants deeply.

Qu Gaoyi’s ferocity and courage truly instilled terror in the enemy. After two fell, the remaining men grew cautious, unwilling to approach him closely.

“What’s there to fear? So many of us and we can’t bring down a single Blood Servant?” Yang Zhao shouted furiously, sensing the tide turning.

At this point, there was no turning back. It was all or nothing.

He saw through Yang Kai’s strategy of lying low. If they didn’t defeat him tonight, this youngest brother would be a terrible enemy in the future—perhaps even more so than eldest brother Yang Wei.

He was resolved to end him tonight.

Yang Zhao’s shout had an effect. Those attacking Qu Gaoyi had only been intimidated by the legend of the Blood Servants Hall prestige. Once they steadied themselves, they realized Blood Servants were not invincible.

Qu Gaoyi’s relentless offense, though scattering enemies and killing two, left him no defense and inflicted many new wounds on himself.

Moreover, their numbers were ample. Avoiding Qu Gaoyi’s deadly moves was easy among them. Together, they could overwhelm this powerful Blood Servant.

Unless he used the Blood Fury Technique—but without support, he had no time to unleash that forbidden skill.

Suddenly, everyone’s spirits rose high, their fighting spirit roaring. They shouted as they released various martial skill and treasure powers.

Ten or more rainbow beams shot from all directions like arcs of light, converging onto Qu Gaoyi surrounded in the center.

Even a Blood Servant as skilled as Qu Gaoyi could not hold back such a barrage. More wounds appeared on his body instantly.

Yet he said nothing, persisting in exploding his true essence and soul techniques.

The clear outcome of such a strategy was certain death for Qu Gaoyi. But Yang Shen and Yang Zhao’s men would also lose over half their number.

Qiu Yimeng’s beautiful eyes flickered. She glanced toward the central hall entrance, then at Yang Zhao and Yang Shen, her mind spinning rapidly.

Ying Jiu must not interfere now. If he acted, then either Yang Zhao or Yang Shen could easily snatch the command flag with their Blood Servants.

It was only because Ying Jiu hid in the shadows that he restrained both Yang brothers and served as a powerful deterrent.

Ying Jiu was clearly well aware of this. So even when watching Qu Gaoyi with heavy gaze, he remained indifferent.

But Ying Jiu’s absence meant Qu Gaoyi alone could not defeat their foes, something Qiu Yimeng also understood.

At present, protecting the command flag was assured. The biggest key was keeping the Blood Servants alive; otherwise, Yang Kai’s strength would be greatly diminished.

“Go assist!” After a moment’s thought, Qiu Yimeng commanded softly.

Autumn Rain Hall’s people instantly sprang into action. Xiang Tianxiao waved his hand; members of the Xiang family poured in from all directions. Second Young Master Xiang led the charge personally, wielding his treasure great blade with courage.

His strength could not match the Divine Roaming Realm, but not all of Yang Zhao and Yang Shen’s forces were Divine Roaming Realm masters—there were some True Essence Realm warriors.

These were Xiang Tianxiao’s targets.

“Kill one, lose one!”

Seeing Xiang Tianxiao rush forward, Xiang Chu gave a slight snort, eyes full of disdain.

This younger brother was indeed talented and well-liked in their clan. But no matter how outstanding, he could never be the head of the Xiang family!

Because once a fight started, he would always be the first to rush into danger.

What kind of head of the family would lead charges and risk his own safety? If that were the case, every few days a new head would be appointed across the land’s families.

A family head must lead accordingly—sitting firmly in the rear to command and strategize.

Leading charges was for generals, not generals-in-chief!

Watching Xiang Tianxiao’s figure, Xiang Chu’s gaze darkened with sharp chills.

“You, join in too!” Qiu Yimeng turned to see the carefree smiling Huo Xingchen.

“I join in too?” Huo Xingchen’s eyes went wide.

“Stop with the nonsense. You’re a Huo Family son, do you think they’d dare kill you?” Qiu Yimeng scolded, grabbing Huo Xingchen by his clothes and hurling him toward the chaotic battlefield.

Huo Xingchen screamed as if a falling meteor, crashing hard into the ground and making a huge pit.

Qiu Yimeng sneered, “No one dares kill you—at worst, they’ll just wound you.”

“Damn woman!” Huo Xingchen’s feet numbed for some time before sensation returned. Grinding his teeth, he cursed privately but then smiled slyly, raising both hands. “Don’t hit me, alright? I’m Huo Xingchen, the sole heir of the Huo Family! Whoever hits me, I won’t let it go!”
