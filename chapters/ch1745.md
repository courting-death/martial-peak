## Chapter 1745 — Qingmu Star

Within the Star Domain, the many Cultivation Stars differed greatly from one another because each possessed its own distinct heavenly laws.

Whether in terms of Spiritual Qi, produced resources, or the number of warriors living upon them and the achievements those warriors could reach, the contrasts between different Cultivation Stars were stark.

Take Tongxuan Continent, for example; the Spiritual Qi there was extremely thin, and cultivators could only advance as far as the Saint Realm before reaching their limits.

On other Cultivation Stars, cultivators’ limits might be the Saint King Realm, the Origin Returning Realm…

Although Dark Star’s Spiritual Qi was abundant—enough to meet the demands for advancement to the Void King Realm—the suppression of its local laws prevented cultivators from sensing the mysteries of the Void King Realm, so they could only look on with regret.

Among the many Cultivation Stars, the few most fertile ones were treated as the primary stars of the major powers.

For example, Hengluo Commerce Guild’s Shuiyue Star, the Sword Alliance’s Sword Star, Purple Star’s Ziyao Star…

These main stars surpassed other Cultivation Stars in many respects.

Qingmu Star could only be considered an ordinary Cultivation Star; compared with Dark Star it was roughly comparable, though its area was about half as large.

Before Qingmu Palace, Gu Jianxin’s warship descended slowly, and below, Sword Alliance cultivators had already come forward to pay their respects.

At the forefront stood a beautiful woman. Her features were alluring and her figure graceful, clad in a dark robe that strained to contain her ample chest. Her slender waist seemed fragile enough to break under a single grasp, and her legs were long and shapely. A gentle smile graced her face, her eyes clear as flowing water yet brimming with endless charm, while a mature and intoxicating aura lingered around her.

Gu Jianxin stepped down from the warship and greeted warmly, “Aunt Lan. Long time no see.”

The woman called Aunt Lan returned the smile and said, “Greetings, Young Alliance Master—this subordinate has awaited you.”

Saying so, she performed a slight courtesy, and the cultivators behind her hurriedly bowed in greeting.

“You’re among friends; Aunt Lan needn’t be so polite.” Gu Jianxin grinned; it was clear their relationship was close.

“Manners must not be abandoned!” Aunt Lan smiled faintly; her expressive eyes swept behind Gu Jianxin and gave Qin Wuhui a slight nod as a greeting, then fixed on Yang Kai with a hint of suspicion.

She knew perfectly well who accompanied Gu Jianxin, but Yang Kai’s face was unfamiliar to her. Her Divine Sense swept over him and found that Yang Kai was in the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Naturally, she felt some puzzlement.

“It’s windy outside; let’s go in first.” Gu Jianxin did not immediately introduce Yang Kai’s background to the woman; he merely said this.

A flash of light crossed Aunt Lan’s eyes and she pursed her lips with a smile. “Very well, Young Alliance Master, please lead the way.”

With that, she went ahead to guide them.

Qingmu Palace was a landmark building on Qingmu Star, the Sword Alliance’s main headquarters on the star, responsible for managing local affairs.

Yang Kai followed without showing any reaction, paying closer attention to the woman called Aunt Lan.

Although he did not deliberately probe with his Divine Sense, from the impression she gave he was certain she was a Void King Realm expert!

That made sense; Qingmu Star was important to the Sword Alliance, so it was only natural that a Void King Realm expert would be stationed there. Aunt Lan should be a First Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator—her aura was similar to Li Minghai’s, though far from Luo Hai’s level.

Qingmu Palace covered a large area. Once inside, they dispersed the idlers, and only then did Gu Jianxin introduce Yang Kai.

From Gu Jianxin’s introduction Yang Kai learned the woman’s name was Luo Lan, and as he had suspected, she was indeed First Stage of the Void King Realm.

“Aunt Lan is the Star Lord of Qingmu Star, responsible for all matters of the Sword Alliance here!” Gu Jianxin said.

“Star Lord?” Yang Kai’s expression flickered.

“Heh, Brother Yang needn’t be surprised.” Gu Jianxin seemed to have anticipated Yang Kai’s reaction and smiled, “This ‘Star Lord’ is not the sort you imagine; it’s only a title.”

“So it’s only a title.” Yang Kai relaxed. In his understanding, any Star Lord should be a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert—only such a cultivator would have the means to refine a star’s Stellar Origin.

Luo Hai becoming the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star was a matter of luck, and Yang Kai’s own rise to Star Lord of Dark Star owed much to Yang Yan’s help.

Luo Lan was only First Stage of the Void King Realm; if she could be called a Star Lord, then she must have had tremendous fortune!

But if it was merely a title, then it was nothing special—any Void King Realm cultivator dispatched by the Sword Alliance to manage Qingmu Star’s affairs could be called a Star Lord.

The title of Star Lord was merely a post, a name; it did not bring the conveniences and power that a true Star Lord would possess.

“Young Brother, you look surprised—have you seen a Star Lord before?” Luo Lan had a woman’s natural intuition; from Yang Kai’s expression she immediately guessed something.

“Hmm… some years ago I had the chance to see Lord Luo Hai once when I was on Cuiwei Star,” Yang Kai casually explained.

“Luo Hai, huh…” Luo Lan murmured. “A few years ago? It seems Young Brother must have participated in the Blood Prison Trial?”

“Yes.”

“You took part in the Blood Prison Trial?” Gu Jianxin was stunned and looked at Yang Kai in astonishment.

It seemed Yang Kai’s achievements were not merely luck; Gu Jianxin already knew Yang Kai had been to the Imperial Garden when it opened, and now he discovered Yang Kai had even gone to the Blood Prison Trial.

To come away intact from two such deadly places required real ability; luck alone would not suffice.

“Impressive, truly impressive!” Gu Jianxin exclaimed, clasping his fists in genuine admiration.

“Heh.” Yang Kai tugged at the corner of his mouth.

“It’s a pity… less than two years after the Blood Prison Trial, Luo Hai seemed to have been killed; that incident shook the entire Star Domain,” Luo Lan said softly.

“This Young Master has heard about that matter as well. Truly unexpected—someone like Luo Hai would actually be killed. I wonder who could have done it.”

Yang Kai remained silent, his expression unreadable.

“By the way, Aunt Lan, when I came here I was ambushed by Li Minghai.” Gu Jianxin abruptly changed the subject.

“What?” Luo Lan’s face lost color. “Were you injured?”

“The wounds have healed—thanks to Brother Yang’s timely intervention, otherwise I might have met my end.”

“Him?” Luo Lan glanced at Yang Kai with surprise and suspicion. Though she did not know the details, since Gu Jianxin said Yang Kai had helped him escape danger, she did not question it and said solemnly, “Thank you, Young Brother, for your aid; I shall repay you.”

“No need for that,” Yang Kai replied humbly. “Brother Gu and I got along well at first sight; it was a trifling matter.”

“A trifling matter…” Luo Lan’s expression turned strange.

Being ambushed and attacked by a Void King Realm expert was no small thing—she could easily imagine the danger involved. If things had gone badly, Gu Jianxin might not be standing before her now, but would have perished somewhere unknown in the Star Domain.

“That bastard Li Minghai?” Luo Lan fixed cold eyes on Gu Jianxin; murderous intent flashed in her beautiful gaze. “How dare he do such a thing—there will be no place for him in the Star Domain!”

“He’s dead!” Gu Jianxin said in a deep voice.

Luo Lan’s mouth opened slightly; after a long moment she asked, “How did he die?”

Gu Jianxin looked at Yang Kai.

Luo Lan turned her astonished gaze toward him.

Yang Kai smiled, his expression pure and harmless as he said, “While he was fighting fiercely with Brother Gu, I quietly gave him a little strike.”

Luo Lan was momentarily speechless, then a smile suddenly bloomed on her face: “Young Brother, you are full of hidden depths.”

“He was a bit too complacent at the time.” Yang Kai shrugged.

Seeing his casual expression, Luo Lan immediately understood that Yang Kai did not wish to dwell on this topic, and tactfully said, “Li Minghai brought about his own death, no one else can be blamed. But Young Master, you were able to escape danger this time thanks to the aid of a noble person. In the future, you mustn’t act so recklessly again.”

“Understood.” Gu Jianxin nodded solemnly. “Aunt Lan, I brought Brother Yang here mainly to discuss one matter with you.”

“What matter?”

“Brother Yang wishes to build a temporary residence on Qingmu Star and needs a plot of one hundred thousand li—do you have a suitable location?”

“One hundred thousand li…” Luo Lan pondered and said, “There are many places, but I don’t know what sort of location Young Brother prefers. I’ll have someone bring a map of Qingmu Star tomorrow and you can choose yourself.”

“Very well, thank you, Elder.”

“Don’t be polite. You saved the Young Master’s life; a one-hundred-thousand-li plot is nothing to the Sword Alliance.”

“I’ll take my leave for now; I’ll trouble you again tomorrow.” Yang Kai knew Gu Jianxin had brought him here to meet Luo Lan and discuss that land, and that they would have confidential matters to attend to afterward, so it was inappropriate for him to stay.

“I’ll see you out.” Gu Jianxin gestured and led Yang Kai away.

Outside, a maid escorted Yang Kai to a side chamber of Qingmu Palace to rest.

After Yang Kai left, Luo Lan spread out her Divine Sense, then waved a hand to lift the many wards in the room to ensure no one could eavesdrop. Only then did she say gravely, “Young Master, that youth called Yang Kai… can he be trusted?”

“From what I observed on the way, he has no ties to our Sword Alliance. His appearance where Li Minghai ambushed me was merely coincidental; he himself was ambushed when he passed by earlier.”

“Ambushed by Li Minghai and yet he didn’t die?” Luo Lan’s expression changed.

“I can’t imagine how he managed to resolve it,” Gu Jianxin slowly shook his head. “But his strength is beyond question. What he said earlier was merely to give me some face. As for Li Minghai’s death, it can be said that it was almost entirely his doing. Though there was indeed an element of ambush involved, Aunt Lan, you’ve lived so long—have you ever heard of an Origin Returning Realm cultivator killing one of the Void King Realm before?”
