## Chapter 1086 — Hidden Strength

Yang Kai's gaze flicked between Guiche and Diji, and after a long moment he pointed at Guiche and said, "I'll go with you."

Guiche nodded with satisfaction.

Diji wore an indifferent expression; having a laborer to scout ahead wasn't bad, but Yang Kai's strength was far too low — he couldn't respect him. With only the Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivation, he'd lose his life at the first serious danger. What could he possibly do?

The only thing Diji regretted was the Saint Crystals in Yang Kai's Spatial Ring, though with the area's dense Spiritual Qi it didn't matter whether there were Saint Crystals or not. He snorted, his tone mocking as he said to Yang Kai, "Kid, you'll die a nasty death — don't say I didn't warn you."

"Following you will only get me killed faster," Yang Kai shot back.

He didn't fear either of these contingents; couldn't he hide if he couldn't beat them? Guiche, a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, dreaming of capturing him was laughable. Yang Kai's acquiescence was only to use them to probe the secrets of this place.

They were all searching for this place; they clearly knew something about it.

"I'll be waiting to collect your corpse!" Diji flicked a finger toward Yang Kai, then waved his hand and shouted, "Let's go!"

With that, he led the few people who remained with him and flew off in one direction; his party was already small, clearly unwilling to go to war with Guiche and the others again.

"Let's go too." Guiche made no move to stop them, smiling as he said this, then headed in another direction. Three others followed him, and Yang Kai fell in step behind them, taking the rear.

They traveled in silence; Guiche and the others didn't seem in the mood to speak. The previous battle had left them with countless dead and wounded; everyone was still immersed in grief for lost friends and kin, and naturally had no interest in this little outsider, Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was happy to be so ignored; he simply followed behind the four of them and silently observed the surroundings.

Among the four, besides Guiche who was a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, there was another scar-faced man who was also a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — Guiche called him Ganji.

There was also a woman dressed like a young matron, her peach blossom eyes moist and alluring, stirring one’s imagination. The last was a tall, slender young man who looked about the same age as Yang Kai. Both of them were cultivators of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. For now, Yang Kai did not know their names.

With such a lineup, Yang Kai stood no chance in a straight fight against them, but he was confident he could flee. He watched carefully: the lanky, bamboo-like youth was the same man who had been searching the meteor earlier. The Space Array must have been discovered by him.

Along the way the youth would occasionally unroll a piece of seemingly ancient beast-hide paper, on which numerous strange symbols and lines were drawn — it was likely a map.

Under the youth's lead the group pushed forward.

This continent's Spiritual Qi was extremely rich, and the material resources were naturally abundant; medicinal herbs hundreds to thousands of years old grew everywhere. Yang Kai beamed and harvested them in great batches.

Guiche didn't stop him; instead he and the others gathered herbs as well, stuffing them into their Spatial Rings.

Yang Kai offered them a few pointers, telling them how to harvest certain herbs in order to preserve their medicinal potency, and instantly the four looked at him with new respect.

"Are you a pill refiner?" the woman dressed like a young mother couldn't help asking.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

Pill refiners were few and far between. Generally they specialized in pill refinement; their cultivation level and combat power were often secondary and quite low. Hearing Yang Kai speak, the four visibly relaxed their guard.

"What grade of pills can you refine?" the woman asked, more curious.

"Saint-Grade Upper-Level pills, I suppose."

"Not bad." Guiche chimed in with a smile. "With a Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivation you can refine Saint-Grade Upper-Level pills; it looks like in a few years you'll be able to refine Saint King-Grade pills. Such pill refiners are fought over by many factions — kid, work hard."

Yang Kai chuckled and nodded.

"I'm curious — why is your body constantly absorbing Spiritual Qi so quickly? What pill did you take?" the scarred man Ganji eyed Yang Kai suspiciously, his face full of confusion.

It wasn't only him; the others were equally puzzled. Yang Kai displayed no signs of circulating cultivation techniques, yet the surrounding Spiritual Qi continued pouring into his body, helping him increase his cultivation.

This made them very curious and extremely tempted; of course they wanted to pry for details.

"I didn't take any pill; it's thanks to this." Yang Kai opened his clothes and exposed his chest. Four pairs of eyes stared over; there was a pattern of a ghost infant there, its mouth opening and closing as it swallowed — vast amounts of Spiritual Qi were being drawn inside.

"What is this?" the woman couldn't help reaching out to touch it, but she felt nothing unusual.

"Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid?" Guiche's expression changed, and he uttered a low exclamation; he immediately recognized its subtlety.

"Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid?" the other three all cried out in surprise. The lanky youth's eyes blazed with excitement as he said, "That sort of exotic treasure that assists cultivation? He consumed a Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid?"

"Yes." Yang Kai answered calmly.

"Where did you get it? Is there more?" Guiche asked anxiously. "Is there any left?"

The Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid was exceptionally rare; even he couldn't help feeling covetous. With such an item he could save several years of cultivation and double his progress.

"No more. It was given to me by a senior." Yang Kai adjusted his clothes as he spoke. He wasn't afraid of revealing the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid's existence, because such an exotic treasure disappears upon use — even if others tore out his flesh and blood, they couldn't use it again.

Sure enough, upon hearing Yang Kai's answer, all four showed expressions of sudden greed.

A Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior using such an exotic treasure to assist cultivation and still not secluding himself — instead running around the world — was wasteful. Any sane person would find a place rich in Spiritual Qi and seclude until the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid's medicinal effect had faded before emerging.

For a moment the four gazed at Yang Kai with a mix of grievance and fury. Guiche trembled with anger, as if he wanted nothing more than to kill Yang Kai to vent his hatred.

"With resources this abundant here, maybe we can find one or two Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchids," Yang Kai said casually.

The woman shot him a look. "The Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid's growing conditions are extremely harsh; it's not that easy to find. There probably aren't any here."

"Don't babble so much. Kid, lead the way; if you encounter something you can't handle, get back here fast." Ganji was clearly displeased with Yang Kai squandering the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid's effect and barked at him, pointing ahead.

Yang Kai nodded indifferently and took the lead.

This place differed somewhat from the Floating Continent. Although both were thick with Spiritual Qi and rich in resources, this area bore clear traces of demonic beasts, and they were all high-grade demonic beasts — Seventh-Tier and Eighth-Tier beasts were countless. Even the occasional Sixth-Tier appeared in packs, fierce in their momentum.

Guiche and the others clearly didn't know this place well either. Although the youth's beast-hide paper served as a guide, the drawings on it were messy and confusing; no one could decipher it thoroughly, so they had to cross the river feeling for stones.

Yang Kai scouted ahead and encountered no great dangers. Lone Sixth-Tier demonic beasts he could easily slay, and upon detecting traces of Seventh-Tier or Eighth-Tier demonic beasts he would immediately turn back to report the situation to Guiche and let them deal with it.

Such cautious conduct earned the four men's scorn; they thought this kid a coward, afraid of death and useless.

Yang Kai continued to conceal his true strength, only showing the level expected of an ordinary Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior. When fighting demonic beasts he assisted on the side.

Guiche and the others observed him for many days without noticing anything suspicious, and gradually relaxed their vigilance.

A Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior truly didn't warrant too much attention. Guiche had invited Yang Kai and had been frank about using him as a scout; that was decent enough.

But they clearly overestimated the danger here. Apart from demonic beasts there were no other real threats.

As time passed Yang Kai harvested a great deal. Besides the gathered medicinal herbs, he took the teeth, sharp claws, hides, and Inner Cores from the demonic beasts.

Guiche didn't act too ruthlessly; after killing a demonic beast they distributed spoils according to contributions. What Yang Kai received was naturally the least and of lowest value.

Yang Kai had no complaints.

He gradually grew familiar with the group. Although he knew they harbored ill intent toward him, no one spoke it aloud.

The group didn't seem to come from the same faction. Though everyone obeyed Guiche, it was clear Guiche and Ganji each had their own contingent, while the woman and the lanky youth formed a pair, supporting each other in battle.

Yang Kai didn't quite understand why people like them would band together to come here and search for whatever they sought.

He never asked for fear of arousing their suspicion.

After another seemingly united grand battle, Guiche distributed the spoils. The Inner Core of an Eighth-Tier demonic beast was casually tossed to Ganji, several jars of beast blood were collected and each person received one, and the teeth, claws, and hides were all taken, cut, and put into their bags.

Yang Kai held a jar of blood indifferently and slipped it into his Spatial Ring.

Demonic beast blood had many uses: refining pills, setting up arrays, and even sometimes forging instruments required it.

After the battle they rested. The four had brazenly taken many Saint Crystals from Yang Kai, each getting two or three hundred, and were now sitting with their Saint Crystals, quietly circulating their cultivations to recover.

Yang Kai recovered the fastest; in a short while he had fully restored himself.

After an hour the woman opened her eyes and put the unused Saint Crystals back into her Spatial Ring. She walked to the side of a small lake, scooped up clear water, and rinsed her face.

Yang Kai saw that the other three were still meditating, so he walked to the lake, squatted beside the woman, cupped a handful of water, and drank.
