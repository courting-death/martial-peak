## Chapter 1048 — You Look Good Even Without Clothes

On the Dead Star, Yang Kai sat with his eyes closed, cultivating to mend his injuries and restore his strength.

The faint sound of footsteps reached him from ahead; he opened his eyes and looked over, his face brightening.

Xue Yue stood not far before him, strikingly beautiful in a fiery-red long dress whose brilliance marked it as an item of uncommon class — a Secret Treasure.

The gown appeared woven from some indescribable material, its soft fabric clinging to her delicate form and outlining every perfect curve and tempting contour, making her glow like a goddess.

Her long hair, which had always fallen over her fragrant shoulders, had been swept into a bun, a hairpin skewered through it, the pin itself pulsing with a subtle radiance.

Her tender, jade-like arms seemed as if one could squeeze water from them, making one wish to leap forward and bite; two dripping-green jade bracelets adorned her wrists, and a half-exposed, lovely leg showed beneath — each exquisite piece of jewelry underscored her noble, elegant bearing.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but show a trace of infatuation, staring at her in a daze, unable to turn his gaze away.

He cautioned himself inwardly not to be beguiled by this woman’s charms, yet he found it hard to resist her beauty; it felt as if a mere beckon of her finger would make him willing to burn and wade through fire for her without complaint.

As that thought arose, Yang Kai finally became alert, biting his tongue to sober himself.

Xue Yue narrowed her lovely eyes, smugly watching Yang Kai; she seemed well aware of his current state, her pretty face glowing with delight, inexplicably suffused with a sense of satisfaction.

A satisfaction born of a woman dressing for the one she wishes to please.

When Yang Kai broke free from the aura she exuded, Xue Yue frowned slightly, looking surprised and a little disappointed.

She turned, presenting all her allure and beauty, then asked sweetly, "How is it?"

"Beautiful!" Yang Kai praised sincerely.

"Thank you!" Xue Yue smiled even more happily.

"You look pretty good even without clothes!" Yang Kai added.

Xue Yue’s pretty face darkened. She gave him a disdainful look. "A dog’s mouth can’t spit out ivory! Remember this: everything that happened before was fake, and you mustn’t tell anyone, nor expose the secret that I’m a woman. If you do, our agreement is void — I’ll kill myself first, and that soul-chain will take your life as a consequence!"

"I know!" Yang Kai nodded lightly, cocking his head to look at her and grinning, "I feel like you’re enjoying this a bit too much right now."

As she spoke, Xue Yue kept glancing down to inspect her adornments and garments, appearing increasingly pleased and satisfied the more she looked.

"Of course I’m enjoying it!" Xue Yue curled her lips. "They raised me as a boy since I can remember. I never wore women’s clothes growing up; these things I’ve kept in my Spatial Ring for years. Today I finally get to wear them — do you think I’m not happy?"

"Why did Chairman Ai Ou raise you as a man? Why hide your true gender? He has other heirs — even without you he’d have successors. There’s no need to treat you so strictly, is there?" Yang Kai fired questions rapidly, full of curiosity.

Xue Yue’s expression turned stern; after a moment’s thought she said softly, "He has his reasons, and I’m used to it."

She offered no direct answer. Yang Kai didn’t press; as he pondered what to say next, his expression suddenly changed. "Someone’s coming this way."

Xue Yue froze, looking at him suspiciously. "How do you know?"

"They’ve intruded into the area covered by my Divine Sense." Yang Kai’s face hardened.

Xue Yue looked even more puzzled. "You released Divine Sense? I don’t sense it."

Her power was far superior to Yang Kai’s, even though both were in weakened states. If he had truly extended his Divine Sense outward, she should have felt it.

Yet she was completely unaware.

"I have my own secrets too—trust me." Yang Kai said solemnly.

Xue Yue nodded without thinking, "How many? What cultivational ranks?"

“There are quite a few of them—several in the Saint King Realm! Their pressure is even stronger than what you gave off at your peak!”

Xue Yue’s face changed; she snapped, "Then wouldn’t them sensing you mean they discovered you? Whoever comes to the Ice-Cold Dead Domain at this hour must be linked to that earlier trap — perhaps it was placed by them, and they’re searching for survivors to wipe out!"

"That’s what I thought, but they can’t detect my Divine Sense." Yang Kai shook his head.

Ever since he’d researched the truth of space on that Floating Continent, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense had been able to break through spatial bounds, leaping and flickering in strange, elusive ways; it moved without trace, unlike others’ continuous, coherent Divine Sense.

This kind of leaping Divine Sense was hard to detect; even if someone sensed it, they couldn’t trace it back to him unless their strength far surpassed his.

Because of that, Xue Yue was completely ignorant of Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

"This Dead Star is bleak and devoid of Spiritual Qi and energy; if they come here they’ll surely find us!" Xue Yue’s complexion turned unpleasant. "My strength hasn’t even recovered halfway — if they find us…"

She couldn’t bear to imagine what fate might befall her.

If she still held the identity of Young Master Xue Yue, she might have negotiated terms with that unknown enemy; but now she appeared merely as a striking, unfamiliar beauty.

Xue Yue understood better than anyone the fate that awaited a beautiful woman who was captured.

It meant endless torment, degradation, and defilement!

"Leave here! Let’s hide for a while!" Yang Kai remained calm as he summoned the Star Shuttle, stepped onto it, and extended a hand invitingly toward Xue Yue.

"Can you be sure you can avoid their detection?" Xue Yue asked in a low voice.

"No, but it’s better than waiting here to die!" Yang Kai shook his head.

Xue Yue bit her red lip, finding his words reasonable. She nodded and reached out, stepping onto Yang Kai’s Star Shuttle.

Yang Kai gathered her in his arms, resting his head on her fragrant shoulder; with a shift of Divine Sense the Star Shuttle dissolved into a stream of light and carried them away from the Dead Star.

"Don’t move about, though. I don’t exactly loathe you now, but a voice inside still urges me to kill you…don’t let my hatred take over." A flush rose along Xue Yue’s throat and her delicate earlobes turned deep red as she murmured.

It was the first time a man had ever hugged her like that.

Previously on the Dead Star, when she and Yang Kai faced each other naked and rolled about on the ground, she’d been desperate to seize the initiative and slay him; she had little time to feel bodily strangeness then.

Now, linked by the soul-chain, her body had become unusually sensitive to Yang Kai’s touch; even the warm breeze at her ear set her trembling.

"You don’t trust me that much?" Yang Kai chuckled. "I’m quite honest."

"Hmph, I’d be surprised if you were honest!" Xue Yue snatched at the hand that had casually fallen on her flat belly and squeezed it hard.

Yang Kai showed no interest in flirting; his expression grew serious as he piloted the Star Shuttle through the cold, dark starry void in erratic, unpredictable arcs.

Although Xue Yue dared not release her Divine Sense for fear of exposing them, she knew Yang Kai must be evading those unknown enemies.

She couldn’t help but be curious about Yang Kai’s Divine Sense — how such a minor figure at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm could have encountered such strange circumstances to cultivate his Divine Sense to be so unorthodox.

Strangely, being held by Yang Kai caused Xue Yue to feel an inexplicable, supreme sense of safety; as if even facing thousands of pursuing enemies, hiding in his embrace would keep her absolutely undiscovered.

The thought vexed Xue Yue’s heart, for she recognized it as a side-effect of the soul-chain, which made her subconscious find the man familiar and reliable.

A flicker of panic rose in her — she feared falling deeper into such feelings and wanted the soul-chain broken as soon as possible to escape this weakness.

She spoke no more, composed herself, closed her eyes, and began to recover her injuries and strength.

A few days later another Dead Star appeared ahead; Yang Kai steered the Star Shuttle straight toward it.

This Dead Star was slightly larger than the previous one but equally lifeless.

Fierce winds blew across its surface and the climate was harsh beyond measure; those gales kicked up dust for tens of thousands of zhang, making visibility within three zhang nearly impossible.

Yang Kai circled above the Dead Star for a while, found a cave-like place, carried Xue Yue in, sealed the entrance against the dust, produced a luminous strange stone for light, and set it around them.

The cave was small and shallow; they hid in its deepest part.

Whether intentionally or not, Xue Yue sat a good distance from Yang Kai, as if afraid he’d take advantage of her again.

"Their search isn’t aimed this way; we can hide here for a time." Yang Kai retracted his extended Divine Sense and told Xue Yue, "We’ll leave once they get closer."

"Alright, whatever you decide." Xue Yue nodded slightly, unbothered, took out a fine Saint Crystal, held it in her palm, and began to meditate.

While meditating she kept a furtive watch on Yang Kai.

She expected Yang Kai to tire of waiting and come to pester her.

After all, she was the heir of the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s chairman, high in cultivation and rank; Yang Kai was an unknown lowly martial cultivator, utterly inferior in every respect.

For him to become involved with her should be his honor; he wouldn’t let such a lone chance slip, and would surely try to cozy up to her with unrealistic hopes.

So Xue Yue sat first and made clear she had no intention of engaging him.

She secretly waited for Yang Kai to speak first, intending to humiliate him to make him renounce his thoughts of her.
