## Chapter 1493 — Passage Granted

“It is indeed Sect Master Yang.” That elder of great years smiled faintly and clasped his fists from afar. “Pardon my discourtesy; this old man, Liang Yong, is the Third Elder of the Battle Sky Alliance!”

Battle Sky Alliance? Yang Kai frowned. Though his impression of this force was far from good—and they’d had a few run-ins before—he still observed proper courtesy, returning the gesture and saying, “Yang Kai greets Elder Liang.”

“Think nothing of it.” The smile on Liang Yong’s face grew all the more amiable, yet Yang Kai kept feeling there was something off about that smile without being able to say why. Before he could think it through, Liang Yong pointed to the person beside him and introduced, “This is Vice Sect Master Situ Hong of the Leitai Sect. Sect Master Yang should have heard of him.”

“I’ve long heard of your great names!” Yang Kai nodded slightly. He had indeed heard others mention Situ Hong and Liang Yong before—both were top-tier experts of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm on Dark Star—but today was his first time meeting them in person.

The Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect had had many clashes. Though not quite at daggers drawn, they were certainly not intimate to this degree. And yet they had actually joined hands now? Yang Kai’s expression turned strange, but when he looked again at the Protective Mountain Array over there, he could not help but understand.

There are no eternal enemies, only eternal interests. The scene before his eyes was the best explanation.

“Sect Master Yang, please forgive us. It is not that we deliberately mean to intercept you; it is just that you can see the situation now. Dozens of sect forces on my Dark Star have joined hands, intending to break this Protective Mountain Array and take a look inside. So the vigilance around here is a bit stricter—no one may trespass without permission. Also, please pardon Brother Yu’s earlier discourtesy; he was only acting under orders.” Liang Yong spoke again, excusing the one who had attacked Yang Kai just now.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said, “It matters not. I was not injured. Let us leave it at that.”

Liang Yong laughed loudly. “Sect Master Yang is indeed magnanimous. Liang offers his thanks here.”

That old man surnamed Yu also hastily apologized at the side.

“Elder Liang, so at present no one is allowed to enter here?” Yang Kai asked with some displeasure. After all, the Fallen Emperor Mountains was ownerless land, and the ruins of the ancient sect within ought to be open to all. Now that these sect forces had marked it out as their own territory and decreed trespassers be killed without pardon, such conduct was certainly high‑handed.

Still, since dozens of forces had joined hands, Yang Kai could not well say anything. He did not wish to incur the wrath of the many.

“Correct. Half a month ago, that is how the friends here discussed it.” Liang Yong nodded lightly. “We seven serve as the enforcers of this place.”

“I see.” Yang Kai nodded to indicate his understanding.

Liang Yong suddenly smiled slightly again. “However, it is not that no one may enter. So long as one obtains the permission of us seven, one can take part in this grand event.”

“Oh? And what must one do to gain your permission?” Yang Kai raised a brow.

“Mm, that is somewhat troublesome.” Liang Yong wore a look of difficulty and rubbed his temples. “In principle, this Protective Mountain Array is about to be broken. Anyone wishing to participate must first pay a price. Otherwise, would the friends attacking the array there not be making a wedding dress for others?”

What he said had some reason to it. Over there, several hundred Origin Returning Realm cultivators had been bombarding the Protective Mountain Array madly for half a month. All of them wanted to enter quickly and have a look. With success in sight, naturally none of them wished to allow others in to pick up a ready bargain. If they really did so, their hearts would hardly be balanced.

“I wonder—what price must be paid?” Yang Kai mused for a moment before asking, “Elder Liang, why not speak plainly? I’ll see whether it’s something I can afford to bear.”

Liang Yong chuckled. “Sect Master Yang, you treat me as an outsider. If it were someone else, we would certainly ask for a price. But since Sect Master Yang is the Sect Master of the Lingxiao Sect, then… forget it. The Lingxiao Sect is now a force renowned on Dark Star and ought by rights to be qualified to take part in this grand event. Moreover, Sect Master Yang has come alone. This old man will go with the current and do a favor, and agree to let Sect Master Yang pass.”

Yang Kai looked surprised and tilted his head at him. “Doing so will not make things difficult for you, Elder Liang?”

He was at a complete loss, not understanding what the other party meant by showing such goodwill. He felt he had not the slightest ties with the Battle Sky Alliance and even had some enmity. They had no reason to be so easy to talk to.

Liang Yong chuckled. “Of course, I alone surely do not have that authority. This is but a proposal. Whether to let Sect Master Yang pass still depends on the others.”

Saying so, Liang Yong cast his gaze toward the other six.

For a moment, those Origin Returning Realm cultivators looked at one another. Vice Sect Master Situ Hong of the Leitai Sect, however, was forthright and decisive; without even thinking, he nodded and said, “If we allow only Sect Master Yang to pass, this old man has no objection.”

With the decision‑makers of the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect both in agreement, who else would speak against it? They already took their lead from Liang Yong and Situ Hong; at once they nodded one by one in support, without the slightest dissent.

“In that case, many thanks to you all.” Yang Kai cupped his fist slightly, turned into a streak of flowing light, flew past the crowd, and shot straight toward a certain spot on the Protective Mountain Array.

“Sect Master Yang, since you are here, lend a hand as well. The sooner we break the array, the sooner we may behold the various opportunities within.” Liang Yong called out from behind, but Yang Kai was already several hundred zhang away; whether he heard or not was unknown.

After shouting, he turned his head, met Situ Hong’s eyes, and the two shared a knowing smile.

One may wear out iron shoes seeking in vain, only to find what they seek without any effort.

The information they had gathered earlier had led them to believe Yang Kai was heading to Tianyun City. Yet after tracking all the way, they discovered he had come to the Fallen Emperor Mountains. Later, upon hearing of the anomaly at the Fallen Emperor Mountains, the experts of the two great forces also converged here.

He had been fretting over how to track down Yang Kai’s whereabouts—never expecting that Yang Kai would deliver himself right to their doorstep.

There’s a road to heaven, yet no gate to hell—if he insists on courting death himself, he has no one else to blame.

In any case, this was not the place to make a move. With so many eyes about, the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect also had to mind their face and reputation, lest others seize upon it. Let the brat in first; once inside, find a secluded place, and whether to knead him flat or round would be up to them.

Therefore, even if Yang Kai had had no intention of breaking the array, Liang Yong would still have taken the initiative to let him pass. Situ Hong was a jackal of the same lair and naturally would not object. They casually found a pretext and allowed Yang Kai to pass unimpeded.

Of course Yang Kai understood that unsolicited zeal betokened either lust or theft. He did not know what crooked scheme Liang Yong and the others were plotting, but with great skill comes boldness; he would not be timid.

In an instant, he arrived before the Protective Mountain Array and sped toward a certain position.

Over there, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were strenuously driving their Secret Treasures, bombarding the Protective Mountain Array madly, beating that section of the light‑screen until countless ripples spread across it.

“Elder Qian, City Lord Fei!” Yang Kai descended and called out.

The two looked back, and when they saw it was Yang Kai, Qian Tong could not help grinning. “Yang Kai, you heard the news and rushed over too?”

“Mm. A fortuitous coincidence. I was originally going to Tianyun City to find you, but I did not expect you were not in the city.”

“Looking for us? What is the matter?”

“Nothing major. We can speak after matters here conclude.” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Very well. But it is rather strange that the people of the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect would let you in. These days, those who dared to break in were all killed.”

“I do not know why either.” Yang Kai shrugged.

“Since you are here, then lend a hand. This Protective Mountain Array is no simple thing—by who knows how many times it is sturdier than the formation you had at Dragon Lair Mountain.” Fei Zhi Tu interjected from the side.

“Alright.”

The three of them ceased speaking and focused all their attention on attacking the formation before them.

The Secret Treasure Fei Zhi Tu used was still the Blue Jade Bowl he relied on the most. It transformed into a deep‑blue light‑screen dozens of zhang across and, like quicksilver pouring down, slammed toward the formation, producing marvelous effects.

As for what Qian Tong used, it was a Secret Treasure like a short blade. After Saint Yuan was poured into it, a faint dragon’s roar emanated from within the short blade. It transformed into an ink‑green Jiao more than ten zhang long, swaying its head and tail; every attack carried tremendous momentum.

Watching from the side, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with surprise. Whether Fei Zhi Tu or Qian Tong, neither was unworthy of their long‑established fame. Their Saint Yuan was refined and majestic to the extreme. Judged by Saint Yuan alone, both clearly already possessed the qualifications to break through to the Void King Realm.

However, to break through to the Void King Realm, one must temper one’s own Shi to consummation.

This requirement was enough to make ninety‑nine percent of the Origin Returning Realm sigh in despair. Yang Kai also did not know whether Fei Zhi Tu and Qian Tong had reached that point in their attainments in Shi.

He did not simply stand and watch. With a lift of his hand, he flicked out a dozen‑odd golden threads.

At present, he only had two offensive Secret Treasures at hand: one was the Dragon Bone sword Dripping Jade; the other was the Feather Spirit Arrow he had obtained a few days prior, whose might he had yet to test. But whichever it was, neither could be shown lightly.

The Dragon Bone sword need not be mentioned; it housed a wisp of a giant dragon’s remnant soul, and using it now would inevitably draw attention. As for the Feather Spirit Arrow, it was a consumable Secret Treasure, with only enough energy sealed within for two attacks. Once used, it would have to be recharged, and it was not suitable here.

Therefore, he could only employ the Golden Blood Threads secret art.

Fortunately, while hurrying along some time ago, he had studied a bit of the transformations in the latter half of the Golden Blood Threads secret art, and now he could use the Protective Mountain Array before him to get some practice.

The dozen‑odd golden threads shone brilliantly with gold, each containing an extremely terrifying vitality and the power of Qi and blood.

As soon as they were flicked out, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu both raised their brows, slowed their actions, and glanced over sidelong.

“Old Fei, why do I feel that this move of Yang Kai’s is somewhat similar to the Demon Blood Sect’s secret art, the Demon Blood Threads?” Qian Tong’s face was full of doubt; he had dealt with the high‑ups of the Demon Blood Sect and knew even better the uncanny and formidable might of the Demon Blood Threads, so at Yang Kai’s move he immediately saw a clue.

“Similar? It is more than similar—it is carved from the same mold.” Fei Zhi Tu was also shocked. “But their Sect Master exhausted her life’s efforts and cultivated only two Demon Blood Threads, and the other elders, including Jin Shi, have only one. This number Yang Kai has… is it not a bit too many?”
