## Chapter 1499 — The Might of the Formation Talisman

Standing where he was, Yang Kai’s gaze was as cold and sharp as a blade, frosty light radiating in all directions.

He had clearly flown into a true fury.

“Brat, you have only this much skill, so don’t boast shamelessly in the future. Young men don’t know the height of heaven and the depth of earth; only after suffering a little can they see reality clearly. I advise you to surrender at once!” Fang Peng laughed heartily, the muscles on his face twitching slightly—yet no one noticed.

Though his words were light, the shock in his heart was beyond measure.

What kind of freak was this brat? Merely at the First Stage, yet he could withstand the indiscriminate bombardment of more than twenty Origin Returning Realm cultivators. Although he lasted only ten breaths, that could already be called a miracle.

Even he would not dare claim he could do that—was this brat’s strength on par with his?

Moreover, it was said that when he first came to Dark Star he was only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm. Now, in just a little over a dozen years, he had already advanced to the Origin Returning Realm!

Such growth speed was truly a bit too astonishing.

Among the cultivators of Dark Star, none could do as he had—reaching such a terrifying realm in so short a time.

Still less could any of them, at this realm, possess such terrifying combat power as he did!

Staring at Yang Kai, Fang Peng seemed to see boundless possibility and hope—the hope of breaking through to the Void King Realm!

This brat must not be allowed to continue growing. With his current realm not high, he was already so appalling. If he truly grew to the same realm as himself, who on the whole of Dark Star would be his match?

Today, Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect had offended him unto death. If he had the chance in the future, he would surely repay it a hundredfold, a thousandfold. From his eyes and expression, Fang Peng could tell that Yang Kai was not someone who easily forgot hatred.

The brat must die!

Murderous intent surged in Fang Peng’s heart, and he was incomparably apprehensive. He secretly resolved that once the task entrusted this time by Star Emperor Mountain was completed, he would immediately kill Yang Kai. So long as Yang Kai lived, Fang Peng would never sleep or eat in peace.

“He is already a spent arrow—seize him for me!” Fang Peng’s face sank as he gave a low shout; the longer this dragged on, the more likely things would go awry, and he did not wish to delay any further.

As his words fell, half of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators lunged toward Yang Kai, while the remaining half held their ground to prevent Yang Kai from escaping.

In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen experts had pounced to within three zhang of Yang Kai. Yang Kai—who had been standing in place with a face full of vicious resentment, as though he had no strength left to fight back—suddenly grinned. The smile was exceedingly sinister, and then a clear shout entered everyone’s ears.

“Heaven has a road and you do not walk it; hell has no gate, yet you insist on barging in. I shall send you to the netherworld!”

As he spoke, a palm-sized wooden plaque suddenly floated before Yang Kai. Intricate, arcane patterns were carved upon it, and from within the plaque surged a mysterious fluctuation of power; brilliant light burst forth, dazzling to the eyes.

“Not good!” someone cried out in alarm, trying to hastily pull back.

But it was already too late. That light was pure white, and with the plaque as its center it roared outward in all directions. In the next instant, it wrapped all the dozen-plus Origin Returning Realm cultivators who were charging at Yang Kai within it.

Their vision blurred, and these dozen-plus Origin Returning Realm cultivators discovered that they had fallen into a different world altogether.

White clouds drifted across the sky, and verdant grass and trees lay beneath their feet.

Everyone was stunned, their faces blank, not knowing what in the world was happening.

At the same time, Fang Peng and the dozen-plus Origin Returning Realm cultivators who had not moved were all aghast, staring dumbly ahead, unable to believe their eyes.

In that very instant just now, Yang Kai and more than ten companions had actually vanished together. Without any warning, once that pure white light spread out, everyone simply disappeared into thin air.

This was simply far too bizarre.

However, from the spot where Yang Kai had originally been standing, some strange energy fluctuations were emanating.

An old man at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm wearing Leitai Sect robes furrowed his brow, seeming to have sensed something. He lifted his hand and shot out an attack, but it had flown less than three zhang before it was blocked by a film too thin for the naked eye to catch.

“A formation!” The old man’s eyes bulged as he cried out in horror.

“How could there be a formation here?” Fang Peng’s face turned as ugly as could be. They had been on the verge of forcing Yang Kai into a desperate strait and taking him, only for such a sudden change to occur.

Now Yang Kai and those dozen-plus companions had all fallen into a formation. Those outside the formation could not see their traces at all, and with this formation obstructing them, they could not charge in to join up with those people even if they wanted to.

But how could there be a formation here?

If there truly were one, it should have been triggered long ago; it could not possibly have activated at such a critical moment. Could it be that the brat Yang Kai had sensed something beforehand and thus played along, triggering the formation at the moment of crisis?

That was not very likely either!

“Sect Master, this formation should not be one that exists at this place.” The old man seemed to have some study in the Dao of formations and quickly perceived some clues.

“Not one that exists at this place?” Fang Peng frowned at him. “Elder Zou, what do you mean? If this formation did not originally exist here, could it be that the brat Yang Kai set it up?”

“It should be so.” Elder Zou nodded slightly.

“Hmph. Though this old man has not delved much into the Dao of formations, I also know that a formation of such power is not something that can be arranged lightly. Leaving aside needing auxiliary tools like a Formation Plate, just the arrangement alone requires some time. How could he possibly have completed the arrangement in an instant?”

“Sect Master, the problem may lie in that wooden plaque.” Elder Zou mused. “If this old man did not see wrongly, that plaque is very likely the long-lost item of legend... a Formation Talisman!”

“A Formation Talisman?” Fang Peng’s eyelids twitched; he had clearly heard of the name of the Formation Talisman long ago. He stared in astonishment at the elder surnamed Zou. “Are you certain it was that thing?”

“Aside from that explanation, this old man can find no suitable reason to account for how that brat could arrange a formation in an instant. Nine times out of ten, that plaque is a Formation Talisman that has a formation sealed within it—and one of no small might at that!”

“How could he possess such a thing?” Fang Peng’s face was ashen. “Can you break this formation?”

Elder Zou hesitated for a moment before speaking. “If given this old man two days, I should be able to break it. I tested it just now; this formation has no small power. If you want this old man to break it by himself... at the very least it will take two days.”

“Two days...” Fang Peng could only give a bitter smile.

By then it would be far too late.

“To hell with what formation it is—just blast it apart!” A furious roar suddenly rang out. Fang Peng started and turned his head to look, discovering that the speaker was actually Qu Zheng. At this moment, however, this Alliance Master’s eyes were blood-red, scarlet veins faintly visible in his pupils, and his aura was incomparably violent.

He had obviously been driven into thunderous wrath by the pain of losing his son!

“Ahem, Brother Qu, restrain your grief and accept fate.” Fang Peng put on a mournful expression and offered comfort, though in his heart he was already overjoyed. No matter what trouble Yang Kai had caused him, compared to the agony of white-haired sending off black-haired that Qu Zheng suffered, it amounted to nothing.

However, since the two sides were presently working together, he still had to put on an act; otherwise Qu Zheng was very likely to vent his anger on him.

“A mere formation has stumped you?” Qu Zheng ground out through clenched teeth, his expression ferocious and terrifying. “Bombard it with everything you have. Drag that brat out for me. For the hatred of a murdered son, this old man cannot share the same sky with him! I will tear him to pieces!”

“Brother Qu, quell your anger, quell your anger.” Fang Peng was startled and hurriedly said, “Please, be patient.”

“You dare stop me?” Qu Zheng glared at Fang Peng. “Whoever stops me is an enemy of Qu. Qu will never let him off!”

Fang Peng frowned, annoyed, and said, “That brat indeed deserves death. Not to mention that Brother Qu cannot tolerate him, even this old man cannot tolerate him!”

“If that is so, then Brother Fang will act together with me; once we break this formation, that will be that.”

“The formation must be broken, and the man must be taken. However... Brother Qu, before we have completed our task, that brat cannot die. Do not forget who handed down this task. If you, for personal anger, kill him and thereby cause the entire plan to collapse, I believe Brother Qu understands what the consequences will be.”

At these words, Qu Zheng started, at last regaining some clarity. His gaze slipped slightly toward a certain person in the crowd, a trace of dread appearing, and he said, “Brother Fang speaks true. It was careless of Qu.”

“Good, as long as you understand.” Fang Peng let out a long breath of relief. Though part of him wished Qu Zheng would simply kill Yang Kai and drag the Battle Sky Alliance down with him, if such a thing truly happened, his own Leitai Sect wouldn’t escape responsibility either. Both by reason and circumstance, he had to say something to dissuade him. Fortunately, Qu Zheng wasn’t entirely unreasonable and heeded his words — though that left Fang Peng both regretful and frustrated.

“However... once the matter is done, that brat must be handed over to me to dispose of. I want him to taste every cruel torture in the world!” Qu Zheng snarled through gritted teeth.

“No problem. Once the matter is done, whether that brat lives or dies will be for Brother Qu to decide with a single word.” Fang Peng nodded, then shouted, “Don’t just stand there in a daze—break this formation at once and drag that brat out!”

“Yes!” The remaining dozen-plus Origin Returning Realm cultivators responded in unison, hastily using their respective Secret Treasures and unleashing secret arts to attack forward. Even Fang Tianzhong, who had been watching from one hundred zhang away, ran over to add his strength.

While these people were wildly bombarding the formation from outside, within the world conjured by the Formation Talisman, the dozen-plus Origin Returning Realm cultivators that Yang Kai had dragged in were staring at one another, completely at a loss.

A moment earlier they had still been launching an attack on Yang Kai; in the next, they had abruptly arrived here. Anyone would be confused. Moreover, casting their eyes around, they were not together—each was in a different place, the distances between them not exactly far, yet not near either.

“Brother Situ, what is this place?” Battle Sky Alliance’s Third Elder, Liang Yong, turned his head to ask someone not far away. That person was none other than Leitai Sect’s Vice Sect Master, Situ Hong.

Earlier, it had also been the two of them who granted Yang Kai passage, allowing him to join up with Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

“I am not sure, but it appears we have fallen into a formation.”

“A formation!” Liang Yong’s face changed slightly. “Where is Yang Kai?”

“What do you think?” Situ Hong asked back instead of answering.

Liang Yong’s heart lurched violently, then sank straight into the abyss.
