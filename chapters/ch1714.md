## Chapter 1714 — Paths Diverge

"Ming Yue, little one, you never expected to see this day, did you? The grudge of those years I have engraved on my heart; today this place will be your burial ground!" Sha Hu shouted as he fought Ming Yue, his fists interlocked and swinging like a writhing python, slipping through Ming Yue's defenses from an impossible angle and smashing a blow into his chest.

The crimson radiance wrapped around Ming Yue's body trembled visibly, but the effect was not great and it soon recovered.

Seizing the opportunity, Ming Yue formed a blade with one hand and cleaved down viciously; that palm-blade seemed to become a peerless edge as it bit into Sha Hu's shoulder, driving him to sink downward with a grimace of pain.

"To be honest, it's surprising you survived to this day," Ming Yue said in a calm, unhurried tone that sharply contrasted with Sha Hu's raging fury. "But what surprises me more is that your strength has grown to this degree. It seems you also had many strange encounters over the past hundred years."

Sha Hu laughed loudly. "There were no strange encounters — only that I met a benefactor!"

Ming Yue frowned slightly and, amid the melee, cast a glance in the direction where Yang Kai stood.

In an instant he had deduced the hidden meaning in Sha Hu's words, feeling that the unfamiliar face of Yang Kai must be the benefactor Sha Hu had mentioned.

"Ming Yue, you are no match for me now! I will tear you limb from limb!" Sha Hu roared on, seeming crazed with emotion, but he knew better than anyone that blind rage and impulse alone could not defeat Ming Yue; those fierce words were meant only to unsettle Ming Yue's mind.

"This Island Lord will watch with interest!" Ming Yue replied with extreme indifference, as if he did not regard Sha Hu at all.

Within the ring the two bodies rose and fell, entwining and clashing; flesh met flesh, blood sprayed, and the crack of breaking bones sounded from time to time.

This simple, brutal, and ferocious combat made all spectators feel their hearts tremble — especially Ming Yue's followers. They had never seen Ming Yue fight at full strength. Only now did they realize that Ming Yue's position as Island Lord was no fluke; his true combat power was far beyond that of them.

Even Yang Kai watched with great interest at the side.

Although he considered his physical might greater than either Ming Yue's or Sha Hu's, a stone from another mountain could still polish jade. Both Ming Yue and Sha Hu were powerful warriors who had achieved much in physical strength.

Opportunities to observe such fighters at close range were rare.

He put himself in their place, observing and mentally replaying the battle's flow, and even gained a little.

Time passed slowly as Sha Hu and Ming Yue maintained an astonishing intensity and speed in their fight, remaining evenly matched with no clear advantage for either side.

During the battle both men would occasionally shove a Huntian Pill into their mouths to make up for the loss of Qi and blood and their waning physical strength, keeping the crimson radiance about their bodies at peak.

Ming Yue's followers grew inwardly tense; they did not know what would become of them if Ming Yue fell. They wanted to help but lacked the courage, so their hopes turned to Yang Kai.

However, after Yang Kai swiftly slew the two who had come to provoke him with thunderous speed, the remaining ones no longer dared to act recklessly.

These men were roughly equal in strength; even the stronger among them was not so strong as to matter.

Yang Kai crushed the two comrades like ants; if they still could not see Yang Kai's strength now, they were truly blind.

That skirmish was quick and over, not affecting the contest between Ming Yue and Sha Hu, but after seeing Yang Kai's might Ming Yue's attention toward him clearly increased.

Sha Hu instantly grasped the moment, pouring out his strength and beginning to bombard Ming Yue without restraint.

The deadlock began to tilt slowly toward Sha Hu.

Sha Hu's aura grew greater; the crimson radiance about him grew even denser than before and, with an irresistible momentum, he pressed down on Ming Yue.

Ming Yue's situation grew ever more constrained.

The few cultivators who had been watching from nearby also turned slightly pale. Even they could see that the tide of battle was shifting against Ming Yue — the change was subtle for now, but if it continued, his disadvantage would only deepen until he was finally defeated.

That Sha Hu could be so powerful left them almost incredulous.

Yang Kai secretly let out a breath of relief. To be honest, the strength of Ming Yue and Sha Hu was nearly equal — when the battle first began, even he couldn’t tell which way it would turn. But now, barring any surprises, Sha Hu’s victory was all but certain; Ming Yue no longer had any chance of reversing his decline.

As Yang Kai had anticipated, with time Ming Yue's disadvantage increased while Sha Hu grew bolder; of ten exchanges, eight were offensive, forcing Ming Yue onto the defensive as his momentum was gradually worn away.

Finally, when Ming Yue's palm strike revealed a gap, Sha Hu seized the chance, surged forward, and let out a thunderous roar: "Ming Yue!"

The cry seemed to release a century of fury; his Qi and blood surged wildly and his body crouched slightly to avoid Ming Yue's blow, forming a blade with one hand that stabbed toward Ming Yue's heart.

Victory seemed within reach!

A ferocious grin spread across Sha Hu's face.

The desperate Ming Yue showed no panic; he looked coldly at the towering Sha Hu and a mocking smile flickered at the corner of his mouth as he drawled, "Sha Hu, you will never know how powerful this Island Lord truly is!"

Sha Hu's heart lurched; sensing something amiss, he tried to draw back, but a tumultuous surge of Saint Yuan erupted from Ming Yue's body, boosting his already formidable momentum and manifesting a layer of protective Saint Yuan that stopped Sha Hu's strike.

The power of the Shi field exploded outward.

Sha Hu instantly felt as if he had sunk into a quagmire, unable to break free; his state of mind was immediately affected by Ming Yue's Shi field.

Ming Yue struck with a palm that hit Sha Hu square in the chest.

With a sound like a creaking earth, Sha Hu flew backward, spraying blood as he spun through the air.

When he staggered to the ground the crimson radiance about him had dimmed terribly and his face was deathly pale.

He stared blankly at Ming Yue, his eyes trembling violently as he cried, "How can you..."

"Use Saint Yuan?" Ming Yue smiled faintly. "Ghost Isle's own heaven-and-earth law suppresses Saint Yuan; any warrior who enters cannot use it. That is indeed how it should be. But... this Island Lord has broken this place's heaven-and-earth law, so I am the Island Lord — and you are not!"   

"Impossible!" Sha Hu howled, his face filled with unwillingness.

"Nothing is impossible," Ming Yue said lightly, disdainfully regarding Sha Hu, still soaked in blood; to prove his point, a force continued to surge from within him.

It was the power of Saint Yuan!

The Saint Yuan fluctuations of a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert.

Sha Hu stood dumbfounded, gaping at him.

In sheer physical strength he and Ming Yue had been evenly matched; it was only through a hundred years of endurance and will that he had nearly slain Ming Yue earlier. But if Ming Yue could use Saint Yuan, then he was no match at all.

Sha Hu opened his mouth and found he could not utter a single word.

The sustained high-intensity battle had nearly exhausted him; upon sensing Ming Yue's overwhelming power his momentum dissipated and fatigue crashed over him.

A hand gently rested on his shoulder; Sha Hu turned his sallow face and realized Yang Kai had somehow come to his side.

"Yang Kai..." Sha Hu's voice was dry. "Sorry, I dragged you into this."

He had badly misjudged the situation; this attempt at revenge had failed, and not only would he likely die here, but Yang Kai might be buried with him.

Being able to wield Saint Yuan on Ghost Isle, Ming Yue had practically become the absolute master of this place — no one could possibly resist him.

"Elder Sha is badly hurt; rest a moment, let me take over," Yang Kai said with a slight smile, showing none of the fright Sha Hu expected.

Sha Hu's expression flickered with doubt; he did not know what backing Yang Kai had to face an opponent who could use both Saint Yuan and Shi, but seeing Yang Kai so composed cheered him somewhat and he nodded, stepping back several paces.

Ming Yue had remained silent, merely appraising Yang Kai with interest; seeing that he met his gaze without fear, Ming Yue smiled faintly and said, "Why not come over to me? I can make you the deputy Island Lord of Ghost Isle — beneath one and above ten thousand."

Ming Yue's followers looked at Yang Kai with envy, their brows stirring with eager thoughts as if, the moment Yang Kai agreed, they would rush forward with sycophancy.

A deputy Island Lord — such a precedent had never existed on Ghost Isle. Though Ming Yue was Island Lord, he had never appointed a deputy; his followers had often hinted at becoming deputy Island Lord, but Ming Yue had never consented.

They dared not press the matter too far and it had ended unresolved.

But today Ming Yue actually extended an olive branch to Yang Kai — how could these warriors not envy him?

"Not interested!"

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai shook his head and refused without a second thought.

A mere deputy Island Lord of Ghost Isle was not something Yang Kai would deign to accept; he was the Star Lord of the entire Dark Star! If Ghost Isle were not a self-contained space with its own laws it would belong to Dark Star and be under Yang Kai's dominion. Taking a position as Ghost Isle's deputy Island Lord would be a humiliation.

Ming Yue's brow lifted and he said coolly, "That disappoints this Island Lord."

Yang Kai chuckled. "You will be even more disappointed."

"You would oppose this Island Lord?" Ming Yue's gaze burned upon Yang Kai.

"It's not opposition; it's simply that our ways differ."

Ming Yue frowned and sighed. "Very well — then this Island Lord will grant you death!"

Yang Kai laughed loudly. "You don't have that ability! Elder Sha said one thing that was true."

"What?" Ming Yue and Sha Hu asked together.

"With just you, it is impossible to break this place's heaven-and-earth law," Yang Kai sneered.
