## Chapter 2569 — Mi Tian’s Catastrophe

“Sir, it’s the people from Lord Niu’s side!” A yao suddenly approached Yang Youwei, whispering.

Hearing this, Yang Youwei’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly floated up to look, and when he saw the massive creature approaching, he couldn’t help but call out in a low voice, “Niu Quan!”

Niu Quan—Yang Kai had heard the name before, though he hadn’t asked for details. He knew Niu Quan was a Yao General, likely on equal footing with Yang Youwei. He hadn’t expected to encounter him here today.

Yang Kai was considering whether to have Yang Youwei help him silence witnesses, lest unrelated yao discover their involvement and cause trouble. Unexpectedly, Yang Youwei flew straight over to the other side, and once in midair, shouted down loudly, “Old Ox, what are you doing!”

There was no response.

Yang Youwei’s face changed again, urgently calling, “Old Ox, it’s me, Old Sheep! Wake up and look at me!”

The yao who had followed Niu Quan clearly recognized Yang Youwei. Immediately, one yao cried out in anguish, “Lord Yang, please use your arts to save our lord! Today, for some reason, he suddenly revealed his true form and rushed this way, ignoring everything. We couldn’t stop him, and he didn’t respond to any calls.”

Hearing this, Yang Youwei immediately confirmed his suspicions. He glanced at the invisible grave gate, sorrow appearing on his face. He sighed heavily, waved his hand, and flew back to Yang Kai’s side.

Rumble rumble...

Trees snapped in half as the massive creature finally burst out of the forest. Yang Kai stared ahead and saw a gigantic ox-shaped demonic beast, its whole body shimmering with green light. Its hide was covered in deep grooves, crisscrossed and weathered by time. Each of its four hooves was as large as a house, and every step shook the earth.

The beast’s head bore two scythe-like horns, but one was broken off. Whoever did it was unknown. The broken horn didn’t diminish the beast's aura; instead, it made it look even more ferocious.

This must be the Yao General called Niu Quan! Yang Kai understood, though he didn’t know why the Yao General had revealed his true form. Yao, after all, gained much power in their true forms, but lost flexibility compared to human shape. Unless absolutely necessary, yao wouldn’t reveal their true forms.

“What’s going on?” Yang Kai turned to Yang Youwei.

“The time has come—he’s about to enter the tomb.” Yang Youwei let out a faint sigh, his tone tinged with the sorrow of witnessing a fellow sufferer’s fate. He had long known Niu Quan’s days were numbered, but hadn’t expected the end to arrive so suddenly.

Yang Kai looked at Niu Quan, then at the grave gate pointed out by the yao, and suddenly realized, “He can sense the call of the Tomb of All Spirits?”

Yang Youwei nodded, “All creatures of the Ancient Land, before their time is up, can sense the location of the Tomb of All Spirits. They’ll enter it involuntarily. Old Ox, he... sigh...” Another heavy sigh, choked with emotion.

“That’s something worth seeing.” Yang Kai’s brows rose.

He had no ties to Niu Quan and had been unsure if the Tomb of All Spirits was real. Now, with a way to verify it, Yang Kai felt no sorrow—only curiosity, treating it as a spectacle.

Niu Quan’s followers kept calling out, but after transforming, he seemed unable to hear anything. He only marched step by step toward the grave gate.

Soon, all the yao who had followed learned the truth from Yang Youwei’s group. They realized their lord was entering the Tomb of All Spirits, and their faces turned gloomy, grief written all over them.

Under everyone’s gaze, Niu Quan reached the open valley, suddenly stopped, raised his head and bellowed, then plunged forward.

Yang Kai’s eyes widened instantly.

In the void, a gray-black light gate suddenly flickered. The gate was over ten zhang tall, always standing there but hidden from sight. If Niu Quan hadn’t stirred a ripple by entering, no one else would have seen it.

As Yang Youwei had said, only dying creatures of the Ancient Land could see this grave gate.

Niu Quan passed through the gate, his massive body quickly vanishing. As the ripple faded, the gate also disappeared.

The yao who had followed Niu Quan all wept bitterly, wailing in grief.

Yang Youwei smacked his lips, his face full of discomfort.

“There really is a grave gate!” Seeing it with his own eyes, Yang Kai knew Yang Youwei and the others hadn’t lied. It also confirmed that the Third Disciple had truly entered the Tomb of All Spirits!

What now? Yang Kai’s head spun. He didn’t know what dangers lay inside, or how to get out if he entered. If the Tomb of All Spirits was a place with no exit, entering would be suicide. Even with his spatial powers, he dared not act rashly.

But Ruoxi, that girl, had been able to see the grave gate earlier—strange indeed.

Thinking of this, he turned to look at Zhang Ruoxi. He was startled, for Zhang Ruoxi had somehow reached the front of the grave gate, stretching out a hand toward it, her beautiful eyes shining with a strange light.

“Ruoxi, what are you doing!” Yang Kai shouted.

Zhang Ruoxi trembled, snapping back to herself. Realizing she’d unknowingly come to the gate, her face paled and she tried to retreat.

But at that moment, the hidden grave gate appeared again, this time fully revealed.

In the empty valley, a huge gray-black gate emitted strange light. In a flash, the light enveloped the entire valley.

All the yao caught in the light were horrified to find themselves unable to move, terror filling their eyes as they cried out.

Yang Kai was furious. Under the gray-black light, no matter how he tried to use his power, he couldn’t move. Even his spatial abilities couldn’t help him escape.

Everyone alive in the valley, human and yao alike, seemed frozen in place.

“Sir, I...” Zhang Ruoxi nearly cried. She couldn’t explain what she’d done, but the scene was clearly bad. Fear and guilt overwhelmed her, feeling she’d doomed her teacher.

“Save me, sir!” Yang Youwei called out, hoping Yang Kai could help. But seeing Yang Kai was also powerless, his heart sank.

The change happened so fast, no one could react.

Yang Kai struggled but couldn’t break free. Gritting his teeth, he was about to summon the Mountain and River Bell, but at that moment, the grave gate flickered again and vanished.

Along with it, all living beings in the valley disappeared.

A world of gray and black stretched out before them—no sun, no moon, no stars, not a single blade of grass or tree in sight. Deathly silence reigned, as if they had stepped into a vast, desolate graveyard.

Yang Kai, Zhang Ruoxi, and the yao appeared together, the mysterious force binding them gone.

Yang Kai immediately moved to Zhang Ruoxi’s side, enveloping her with Emperor Yuan, alertly scanning the surroundings.

What he saw stunned him.

Everyone seemed to be standing atop a mountain of bones. Everywhere he looked, there were white bones—some small, some massive. The true form of Niu Quan seen earlier was nothing in comparison.

Who knew how many years these bones had lain here, left by demonic beasts. They were all fragile, crumbling to dust at the slightest touch.

“Moo...”

A beast’s roar came from nearby. Yang Kai turned, his eyes narrowing: “Niu Quan!”

The Niu Quan seen in the valley was here too, but now shrouded in deathly aura, lying motionless on the bone mountain, old and waiting for death.

Points of glowing light drifted from his flesh, dancing like spirits, adding a hint of life to the gray world. The lights seemed drawn deeper inside.

As the lights faded, Niu Quan’s vitality dimmed further.

“Tomb of All Spirits!” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

If he’d had doubts before, seeing Niu Quan made it clear what this place was.

The Tomb of All Spirits!

The graveyard of all the Ancient Land’s creatures—a place with no exit. Even the strongest Yao King who entered would never leave alive.

How had he ended up in this cursed place? Yang Kai had been hesitant about entering to search for traces of the Third Disciple, but now the choice had been made for him. Whether he liked it or not, he was already inside, with no opportunity left for second thoughts.

“Sir, I’m sorry! I don’t know what happened!” Zhang Ruoxi was nearly in tears. She knew she’d made a huge mistake, but the situation had been out of her control.

Since entering the Ancient Land, she’d felt off, but hadn’t expected to cause such disaster.

Yang Kai glanced at her, patted her head, and said nothing.

It was too late for words. They were already inside. Scolding Zhang Ruoxi was pointless, and he’d noticed she hadn’t acted intentionally. The most urgent thing now was to escape this cursed place.

He turned to look at Yang Youwei.

Yang Youwei, being a native yao, knew far more about the Tomb of All Spirits than Yang Kai. If there was a way out, he’d know.

But seeing him, Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. Yang Youwei was unlikely to help, for he and the other yao were standing dumbly, shrouded in gray light, as glowing points drifted from their bodies.
