## Chapter 2033 — Another Fierce One Appeared

Surprised though he was, Kang Siran did not press further and instead said, "So then, Pillmaster Yang intends to take part in the auction?"

"That's right, but I do not have many Source Crystals on hand." Yang Kai frowned; he was already turning things over in his mind, thinking which of his possessions he should quietly put up as collateral.

Perhaps… he could put forward a lump of Heavy Earth — it needn't be large; a dragon-eye-sized clump should be enough to cover this auction's cost.

But if a piece of Heavy Earth manifested in the world, it might very well stir up considerable trouble.

"Heh heh, since this Artifact Spirit has such a bond with Pillmaster Yang, then feel free to bid with confidence; if you are short on Source Crystals, I'll front the amount now, and Pillmaster Yang can repay me later," Kang Siran generously declared.

Yang Kai looked at him and frowned. "But Shopkeeper Kang, aren't you planning to bid on that final Dao Origin Fruit?"

Kang Siran waved a hand with a smile. "I originally had some designs on that Dao Origin Fruit, but with the amount of Source Crystals I presently have, the chances are slim. I did not expect so many Dao Origin Realm practitioners to show up at this auction; their wealth is not something I can match. Since Pillmaster Yang is in urgent need, I'd rather oblige. As for that Dao Origin Fruit… heh heh, aren't we soon going to explore that cave dwelling? Perhaps there will be Dao Origin Pills inside."

"How many Source Crystals do you have on hand, Shopkeeper Kang?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

Kang Siran held up a single palm to indicate roughly and said, "I have no more than this; I hope it can lend Pillmaster Yang a helping hand."

"Very well, then thank you, Brother Kang. I will remember this favor." Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

Kang Siran's generous gesture touched him. He quietly resolved that if Kang Siran missed out on the Dao Origin Fruit and also found no Dao Origin Pills during the upcoming cave exploration, then when he later refined Dao Origin Pills he would present one to him to repay the kindness.

During the days he had spent dealing with Kang Siran, Yang Kai found the man to be genuinely decent and someone worthy of friendship.

With Kang Siran's guarantee, Yang Kai felt somewhat reassured. After all, that Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemy furnace had only sold for six million Source Crystals at auction. It was unlikely that Liu Yan's value exceeded that of the Ink Jade Cauldron; even though she had become a sentient Artifact Spirit, her level was only the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, which for some true experts had limited use.

However… exceptions could not be entirely ruled out.

While Yang Kai's thoughts shifted, the Drunken Old Man on the high platform wiped his mouth and continued, "This Artifact Spirit must have had some prior chance — not only does she possess abundant, pure fire-type power, she can also wield lightning-type force. Do not underestimate her; a normal Third Stage of the Void King Realm practitioner would be no match for her in single combat. Only a Dao Origin Realm cultivator could subdue her. Thus, even if one has not cultivated a fire-type technique, buying her would still be of great use: she would be like gaining a powerful helper out of nowhere!"

Hearing the Drunken Old Man lavish such praise on Liu Yan, Yang Kai's face darkened, and swearing in his heart, he wanted nothing more than to rush the stage and stitch the old man's mouth shut.

The more the old man praised Liu Yan, the more eager the bidders would become — which was not good news for Yang Kai.

"Also, this Artifact Spirit… heh heh, she has another form." The Drunken Old Man smiled meaningfully, cast his gaze over the crowd, and with a shifting hand-seal tightened the chain-like binding on Liu Yan; the seal's force surged again, causing Liu Yan to cry out in pain, then, before all eyes, she transformed and suddenly became a stunning beauty clad in scarlet, a willowy figure that stirred the imagination.

"Hss…"

"She can even transform into human form!"

"What a providence this Artifact Spirit must have encountered to be so wondrous."

"Goodness, her body seems to have condensed into substance, somewhat beyond the scope of an Artifact Spirit — I wonder how she would feel to the touch."

As the many cultivators below saw Liu Yan take human shape, they immediately lost their composure and began shouting.

Liu Yan stood atop the high platform, her expression utterly ice-cold, a clear warning to all strangers; that frosty aloofness only added another layer to her striking beauty. Her phoenix-like gaze swept over the crowd, drawing wolfish cries from many of the male cultivators below.

Especially now that Liu Yan was bound by those chain-like seals, her full figure appeared even more voluptuous; some covetous onlookers were already dizzy with desire.

Yang Kai slapped his forehead and sighed heavily.

Kang Siran, who had taken a sip of tea beside him, involuntarily spat it out and, flustered, wiped his mouth while looking at Yang Kai with a peculiar expression. "Brother Yang… I think I now understand what you meant earlier by your 'friend.'"

"Brother Kang, it's not what you think…" Yang Kai protested weakly.

"I understand, I understand — we're all men, after all," Kang Siran chuckled, a knowing smile tugging at his lips.

Yang Kai rolled his eyes and fell silent.

"As you've seen, this Artifact Spirit is not only a very capable helper to keep at one's side — pleasing to the eye and showing face — her beauty is one of the rarest I have ever seen. If I were not so advanced in years, I would fight for her myself," the Drunken Old Man chuckled. "Enough chatter. A fire-type Artifact Spirit, starting bid one million Source Crystals; each raise no less than fifty thousand. Place your bids!"

Liu Yan's starting price was the same as that Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemy furnace, which made Yang Kai's brow knit as a bad premonition rose in his chest.

Sure enough, as soon as the Drunken Old Man finished speaking, bidding broke out in waves.

The one-million starting price shot up to two million within ten breaths.

"Three million!" Suddenly, a clear voice from the A-1 room rang out, causing everyone to pause; those who had been about to bid fell silent.

A one-million increment — such a raise had occurred once earlier in the auction, and… the voice seemed to come from the same room.

"It's that senior!" Someone recognized the voice as that of the Dao Origin Realm expert who had bought the Ink Jade Cauldron and cried out.

"Wow, this senior is truly wealthy — he just spent six million on the Ink Jade Cauldron and now he's bidding on this Artifact Spirit too."

"Do you not understand? If he can acquire both, they will complement each other. Fusing this Artifact Spirit into the Ink Jade Cauldron could very well elevate the cauldron to Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level, perhaps even approach Imperial Treasure level."

"I see — so this senior is determined to obtain this fire-type Artifact Spirit."

"Heh heh, let's see how deep his pockets run; there are many here interested in this Artifact Spirit."

When that voice called out three million, Yang Kai felt his heart lurch.

He, too, recognized whose voice it was — because the man had just purchased the Ink Jade Cauldron, his interest in Liu Yan was unsurprising; as others speculated, he likely intended to fuse Liu Yan into the cauldron to improve its quality.

The man's apparent wealth silenced many prospective bidders, leaving the auction quiet for a time.

Seeing this, Yang Kai had no choice but to act and shouted, "Four million!"

He could not let Liu Yan fall into another's hands — even if it meant losing everything.

After Yang Kai's shout, Liu Yan — who had been looking around coldly on the platform — trembled slightly, glanced toward the B-9 room and quickly averted her eyes, though a subtle curve lifted her mouth.

She knew in her heart that Yang Kai would not allow her to be taken by someone else.

"Another fierce one has appeared."

"Ha ha, this is getting interesting — I wonder who will win in the end."

"Then we'll see who has more Source Crystals."

Yang Kai raised the bid from three million to four million in a single breath, matching the other's one-million increment and showing a courage equal to his rival. From the A-1 room, a lean and capable-looking man of about forty frowned; his Divine Sense flared and swept toward the B-9 room.

Though these rooms had seals to block general Divine Sense probing, they were only temporarily arranged and not very strong. The lean man's Divine Sense broke through and pressed down on Yang Kai and Kang Siran.

Kang Siran immediately stifled a groan; his face turned pale as a choking sensation rose in him.

Yang Kai's body also dipped, but with a turn of his Divine Sense he remained unscathed.

Dao Origin Second Stage! Yang Kai's heart sank as he judged the man's true realm by the strength of his Divine Sense.

"Brother Han!" From the high platform, the Drunken Old Man — as auction host — could not allow a powerful cultivator to bully weaker ones and thus shouted, "Please cease!"

He called out the lean man's surname at once, clearly already aware of his identity.

The lean man surnamed Han sneered, "Han did nothing; I was merely looking at them, Vice City Lord, no need to be anxious."

The Drunken Old Man frowned and said calmly, "Better so; Brother Han is a distinguished guest and naturally knows the auction rules."

"You need not remind me," the Han man snorted, evidently displeased.

The Drunken Old Man nodded slightly and said, "Then let the auction continue: a friend in B-9 room has bid four million; Brother Han, will you raise?"

Before the Han man could answer, a neighboring room suddenly rang with a hearty laugh: "I bid four million five hundred thousand!"

That laugh was arrogant to the extreme, as if the speaker held others in contempt, and even the Drunken Old Man on the platform frowned.

Han's expression turned severe; his retracted Divine Sense swept leisurely toward the adjacent room.
