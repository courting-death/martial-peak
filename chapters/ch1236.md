## Chapter 1236 — Sect Ruins

Yang Kai flashed like lightning through the mountain range. Though an inexplicable heavenly law still suppressed him and he could not fly freely, without Daiyuan holding him back he could stretch his limbs and use his Wind-and-Thunder Wings to speed along the route.

He had no intention of lingering in the Fourth Layer; although he knew there might be some rare Spiritual Herb or Spiritual Medicine here, searching for them would be far too time-consuming.

He wanted to see whether a Fifth Layer Heat-Flame Zone existed; if it did, then this trip’s main goal would be achieved.

The mountain range was immense. As Yang Kai burst into it he felt the region’s Spiritual Qi so thick it was almost obscene—far superior to any star or place he had previously visited, even faintly comparable to that mysterious Floating Continent.

Mists curled between the peaks; vast, snow-white clouds floated like cotton, drifting lazily from mid-slope through the depths of the ranges.

Compared to the conditions at Dragon Lair Mountain, this place was a world apart—nothing to compare.

Yang Kai’s eyes showed shock and fervor. He thought that if this were not Flowing Flame Sandland and not a forbidden region of Dark Star, such a continuous mountain range alone would be worth great powers and major Sects slaughtering one another to seize.

Which great power or Sect would not settle where Spiritual Qi gathered thickly? Beneath each family’s foundation lay vast Earth Veins; it is the Spiritual Qi that slowly emanates from those Earth Veins which allows a Sect to endure for thousands of years, to remain unshaken, and to let disciples advance at twice the speed.

For example, as Yang Kai knew, beneath the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Nine Peaks was a sizeable Earth Vein, which is why Spiritual Qi pressed so strongly between the Nine Peaks.

The Tianxiao Sect was no different; beneath its one hundred and eight peaks Earth Veins also existed.

No founding ancestor of a Sect would choose a base in a place barren of Spiritual Qi; the primary criterion for a Sect’s site is an Earth Vein—the larger and higher-quality the better.

And this continuous mountain range before him was absolutely one of the best places to establish a Sect. If disciples were raised here they would seize all the advantages of heaven and earth and grow at a speed beyond ordinary people.

Yang Kai was certain that beneath this range there must be one or more high-grade Earth Veins.

It was a pity: this was the Flowing Flame Sandland. The openings here only occurred occasionally, and each opening lasted less than half a year before closing again. No one could build a Sect here, and no one could remain to cultivate for long.

This made Yang Kai sigh repeatedly.

Though he was alone now, many friends and relatives remained on the Tongxuan Continent. If one day he could return and bring them into the Star Domain, this mountain range would be an excellent place to settle—of course, he would first need the strength to protect himself, or else he would only bring doom upon them.

Shaking his head to dispel the stray thoughts, Yang Kai continued to press on.

The mountains were tranquil and supremely elegant; no birds or beasts were seen. It seemed that within the Fourth Layer only Yang Kai was alive.

He was right: even if there were Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine here, they must be exceedingly scarce. Despite his sprint, he had not encountered a single specimen; not even the air carried the faintest medicinal scent.

Ten days after delving into the range, while hurrying along, Yang Kai suddenly froze. He stopped, frowned, cupped his ear and listened for a moment, his expression changing.

He had heard violent sounds coming from somewhere ahead.

Someone? And they were actually ahead of him. A cold face flashed through Yang Kai’s mind as he wondered if that person had entered this place earlier.

From the sound it did not seem like a fight; rather, it sounded as if that person were battering something. Violent waves of energy pulsed from there; the commotion was enormous.

Yang Kai’s curiosity was immediately piqued. He had encountered nothing during ten days of travel; now someone was ahead of him making such strange noise—of course it drew his attention.

He held his breath and crept forward softly to see what was happening.

Though Yang Kai had never practiced any concealment technique, his Divine Sense was extremely powerful. If he did not make a conspicuous disturbance and the other’s cultivation was not far above his own, the other should not detect him.

He approached silently; the closer he came to the source of the sound, the more shocked he was by the terrifying methods the man was using.

After advancing several dozen li, Yang Kai halted and looked ahead; his heart stirred and his face showed horror.

A hundred zhang away stood a man with a sword-like figure and a face carved as if by a knife—the very fellow from Star Emperor Sect who had once, in full view of many, cut the Red Candle Fruit into pieces. Now his entire body radiated appalling Saint Yuan fluctuations. Having employed some secret technique, he hovered about a foot above the ground, his huge body trembling and flushed as he forced his Saint Yuan. Grasping an unremarkable Silver Jiao Spear, he transformed it into a rain of spear shadows, striking at the void ahead.

What shocked Yang Kai was not simply the man’s stunning methods.

His technique was indeed formidable—the spear shadows his Silver Jiao Spear unleashed became a host of giant silver jiao that surged forward, each nearly taking on substance and terrifyingly fierce. Faced with such a beastly assault, even Yang Kai would have had to evade, lest he suffer greatly.

Yet before the man the void seemed to hold an invisible barrier. Every silver jiao that surged forth was stopped by this barrier; the midair only stirred with layer upon layer of ripples that spread outward, and those silver jiao returned time and again in vain.

A sealing formation! No— a Guardian Mountain Array! Yang Kai’s heart leapt.

He had once served as the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and, when it had been besieged by a powerful enemy, personally activated the array that guarded the Nine Peaks—so he could tell at a glance what this was.

In such a desolate stretch of mountain, where even insects and birds were absent, a Guardian Mountain Array existed! Moreover, it was extremely refined—the Star Emperor Sect man’s ferocious assault had no effect at all; not a scratch could be seen.

Yang Kai’s face was full of awe.

Flowing Flame Sandland had existed for at least tens of thousands of years, and from the Third Layer onward no one had ever trodden it; the Fourth and Fifth Layers were the same. This meant that this Guardian Mountain Array had been here for at least tens of thousands of years.

After tens of thousands of years it still provided such powerful protection—one could imagine how impregnable it had been when first formed.

Why would there be a Guardian Mountain Array here? Such things were generally deployed by Sects at great expense of manpower and resources.

Yang Kai’s gaze passed the Star Emperor Sect disciple and looked farther; at that sight his eyes narrowed.

In the distant ranges, mists lay dense and clouds piled white. Countless sacred mountains and precious sites were sheltered deep inside by that Guardian Mountain Array. Though he could not make out how tall those peaks were or what lay within, Yang Kai vaguely discerned the outlines of buildings in the fog—jade pavilions and towered halls, like scenes not of the mortal world.

Yet when Yang Kai tried to look more closely, everything vanished—only the steady drift of clouds remained, and the occasional corner of a tower would flicker in and out of the mist.

There was actually a Sect here!

Though he had lamented that this place could not be used as a Sect’s foundation, when he confirmed that a Sect actually existed within this continuous range his heart was still shaken.

Who could build a Sect in such a place? What kind of people dwelt within?

Thinking further, Yang Kai felt that something was off. If someone from Star Emperor Sect had already made such a commotion, and if there were truly people inside, they would not have stood by indifferently—they would have appeared to teach him a lesson long ago.

It seemed there was no one inside the Sect—only ruins!

Realizing this, Yang Kai’s heart raced.

Sect ruins—and from the occasional glimpses of jade pavilions and tower corners, those ruins seemed remarkably intact. If he could enter, he might find many valuable treasures.

A Sect that could be built in such a place and deploy so powerful a Guardian Mountain Array would surely not have been obscure tens of thousands of years ago; there had to be many things inside.

"Who?" A low bark rang like something right beside Yang Kai’s ear, snapping him from his shock. At the same time his Sea of Consciousness trembled as if pierced by an invisible awl.

Yang Kai’s face went cold. He hastened to muster his Divine Sense to resist the attack attempting to break his Sea of Consciousness, and his body blurred as he vanished from the spot—reappearing some ten zhang away.

"Huh?" The Star Emperor Sect man had stopped his actions without Yang Kai noticing. He fell from his one-zhang hover to the ground, still clutching his Silver Jiao Spear, and looked at Yang Kai with some surprise.

Yang Kai forced a wry smile. He knew that because the discovery of the Sect ruins had excited him, he had been careless and exposed his trace.

Since he had been discovered, Yang Kai decided to show himself openly. After all, he had harbored no ill intent toward the man and felt no shame about appearing.

"Of all people, it’s you!" The Star Emperor Sect cultivator’s expression was strange. He had met Yang Kai twice before—once in that Stalactite Cave and once during the scramble for the Red Candle Fruit—but he had never noticed Yang Kai’s presence. Now he saw how deeply Yang Kai could hide his strength. The soul attack just then had been silently nullified, which showed his prowess.

This forced the cold man to reassess Yang Kai, wondering whether he had concealed his cultivation.
