## Chapter 1971 — Why Did You Ambush Me

"Secret Technique, Banish!"

Yang Kai knew that if he did not use his trump card now there would be no chance, so at that moment he could not worry about exposing anything and hurriedly unleashed his spatial power.

Before him a black hole suddenly opened, like the gaping maw of a starving beast, greedily devouring the black-flame dragon that had been weakened layer by layer and banishing it into the endless void.

From a distance the savage, chaotic surges of power provided excellent cover for Yang Kai's secret technique, so onlookers ignorant of the truth would only assume that both sides' immense forces had collided and caused the space to collapse.

At the very least, Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei, who had witnessed the banishment technique with their own eyes, did not think of spatial power being used; instead they stared at it all in horror, their faces trembling.

Instead, Mo Xiaoqi, who had been concentrating on preparing her secret technique and stirring her Secret Treasure's power, suddenly brightened and looked at Yang Kai with utter astonishment.

Yang Kai was completely oblivious to all this; now he was in a bind and indescribably vexed.

If he did not dodge, the Fire Bird's attack would strike him first; but if he dodged, Mo Xiaoqi would be in danger. This forced him to tear into Mo Xiaoqi with a torrent of invectives in his heart while still having to stand his ground as a human shield.

The joint resistance from Yang Kai, Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei had clearly shown the Fire Bird that its opponents were troublesome; its crimson eyes brimmed with rage. It spread its wings, and with a casual sweep countless pitch-black fireballs rained down upon the three of them in a deluge.

Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei cried out and continuously employed exquisite footwork to dodge, but the sheer number of fireballs was overwhelming; they could only deploy their defensive Secret Treasures, hoping for a sliver of safety.

Yang Kai's face darkened like the bottom of a pot; while Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei moved freely, he could only stand rooted, forced to unleash his Golden Blood Threads, which transformed into a skyful of golden light and knocked the incoming fireballs aside.

Although the effect was considerable, Yang Kai felt bitter; as soon as the Golden Blood Threads touched those fireballs many were burned away.

Those were all things transformed from his own Golden Blood. Each strand was extraordinarily precious. In this short time he had already lost many, leaving him willing to cry but having no tears.

"Ah—my Beiyun Mirror!" Xu Qing's anguished cry rent the air. Yang Kai snatched a glance up to see the treasure mirror in Xu Qing's hand wreathed in black flame, beginning to melt in the blink of an eye. In a panic he hurriedly flung the mirror aside, lest the fire consume him.

Judging from the power fluctuations emanating from that mirror, it was unmistakably a Void King-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure!

It seemed he was not the only one suffering heavy losses! If his Golden Blood Threads were damaged he could use Golden Blood to mend them, or at worst retrain them; but if the other's Void King-Grade Secret Treasure were burned, then truly all would be lost.

At that thought Yang Kai's mood immediately improved considerably.

Not only had Xu Qing lost his Beiyun Mirror, Yu Ruomei's hairpin-shaped Void King-Grade Secret Treasure had also been destroyed by the black flames. The two, ruined by such heavy loss, stared at the Fire Bird with boundless hatred, but cowed by its ferocity they dared not advance and could only flee in disarray.

The Fire Bird suddenly let out a cry—within that sound was an inexplicable anger that rang up to the ninth heaven.

The instant that sound rang out, everyone's faces changed drastically.

For this could very well draw others' attention; if it lured the martial artists deep within Yuqing Mountain to this place, all four of their efforts would have been for nothing.

At the moment Yang Kai was distracted, a fireball suddenly shot toward him. His face darkened and he prepared to use his old trick to banish it, but to his utter surprise the fireball exploded right before him, and in an instant endless pitch-black embers rained down like hail toward him.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed sharply; without a second thought he immediately unleashed another secret technique.

Dragon Transformation!

With a piercing dragon roar a huge dragon head flashed behind Yang Kai; in that instant dragon might spread forth and the Fire Bird in front evidently froze for a moment, its crimson eyes revealing a trace of apprehension.

Scales surfaced piece by piece, enveloping more than half of Yang Kai's body; even a true dragon scale appeared upon his chest, shielding the vital area.

Boom, boom, boom...

A barrage of sounds came as countless black flames slammed into Yang Kai; he spat blood, the black fire clinging to his skin and burning fiercely, his internal strength beginning to dissolve at a speed like snowflakes under the scorching sun.

Yang Kai's face turned sullen; he desperately stirred the Golden Sacred Dragon's primordial power, which finally checked the spread of the black fire.

But he looked utterly miserable—his overall momentum had greatly diminished.

"Miss Mo Xiaoqi, I've reached my limit," Yang Kai hurriedly said, then moved to withdraw. He had already done all he could; if he stayed any longer the situation might turn for the worse. Standing before Mo Xiaoqi to buy her so much time—even to the point of injuring himself—was more than enough.

"I'm fine!" Mo Xiaoqi cried, waving her hand. The aquamarine sphere before her suddenly gave out the sound of crashing waves, making one feel as if standing at an ocean and listening to waves strike.

The water-blue sphere abruptly shattered into droplets of mist, which surged forward like living things.

The mist washed over Yang Kai's body and the burning black flames were instantly extinguished.

Immediately after, the mist reached the Fire Bird and enveloped it, reforming into a water-blue sphere.

This water-blue sphere was many times larger than before; no matter how the Fire Bird struggled inside, it could not break free from the sphere's embrace.

After doing all this, Mo Xiaoqi seemed somewhat exhausted; her delicate face was pale and her heaving chest rose and fell violently—clearly using this Secret Treasure had placed a heavy burden on her.

Though the cost was not small, the result was gratifying.

"Hee hee, finally caught you, little thing—let's see where you run now," Mo Xiaoqi said with a giggle as she looked ahead.

Yang Kai's face suddenly darkened and he warned, "Careful!"

As he spoke he hurriedly darted aside; a strange figure materialized behind him and a secret technique struck Yang Kai's afterimage, shattering it.

The silhouette revealed itself, brow furrowed—apparently it had not expected its carefully laid ambush to be seen through by Yang Kai.

This person—if not Xu Qing, who else could it be?

At the same time Yu Ruomei's figure appeared behind Mo Xiaoqi; in her slender palm lurked brutal power, and a cruel, greedy smile adorned her lovely face as she slammed a palm into the small of Mo Xiaoqi's back.

Mo Xiaoqi uttered a miserable cry; her mouth gaped and a jet of blood spouted. She was flung forward, her beautiful eyes still full of disbelief.

"Ah!" Alongside Mo Xiaoqi's wail, Yu Ruomei gave a cry of shock.

After delivering that strike, Yu Ruomei herself seemed as if she had been grievously injured; her body staggered backward, her pretty face went pale, and her palm burned with searing pain. She raised her hand and looked down; in an instant her expression soured and she screamed, "How is this possible? What is this?"

On her palm there appeared an extremely bizarre mark, like a ghastly, contorted ghostface; one could faintly hear a piercing wail from it, sending chills down one's spine.

At that moment two eerie lights glowed where the eyes of the ghostface would be; through that glow Yu Ruomei seemed to perceive a lofty being coldly watching her.

Her mind faltered and she collapsed to the ground trembling all over.

"Ruomei, what's wrong with you?" On the other side, Xu Qing, whose ambush had failed, saw Yu Ruomei fall and cried out.

Yu Ruomei sat there with her eyes vacant, dazed and motionless on the ground. If anyone could pierce her Sea of Consciousness with Divine Sense, they would see, blazing within, a ghastly face identical to the one in her palm, ravenously devouring her soul-energy—each fraction of Divine Sense it consumed dulling the light in her eyes a little more.

Elsewhere Mo Xiaoqi coughed lightly as she stood; judging from her state, though struck by the ambush she bore no serious harm. She turned and looked at Yu Ruomei in bewilderment and said, "Why did you ambush me?"

She looked heartbroken and indignant—there was no sign of pretense.

After all, to be stabbed in the back by a trusted companion—if not for the protection of powerful armor, she would likely be a corpse now.

"You really are a foolish woman," Yang Kai said as if looking at a fool.

Mo Xiaoqi turned to Yang Kai, her big eyes brimming with tears, and said, "How am I foolish?"

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead with his hand, truly not knowing how to explain to her.

"What did you do to her?" Xu Qing snapped, turning to roar at Mo Xiaoqi when all calls to Yu Ruomei received no response.

Mo Xiaoqi's body shuddered; looking terrified, she waved her hand and said, "I didn't do anything to her. I'm wearing treasure armor; anyone who ambushes me will suffer the backlash of the Evil Ghost Mark—she... she..."

Yang Kai was dumbfounded!

Was it really appropriate to reveal her secrets so simply?

By now he was certain that the girl called Mo Xiaoqi was not the scheming sort he had imagined; she was utterly naive, truly a simple, innocent little girl!

She couldn't possibly be only as old as she seemed on the surface, could she?

Yang Kai was startled by the thought that had flashed through his mind.

If that were true, it would be terrifying.

"Evil Ghost Mark?" Xu Qing frowned, apparently unfamiliar with the technique, but soon he shook his head and said coldly, "Fine! One fewer person is good—I'll take all the benefits for myself."

He no longer cared about Yu Ruomei's fate and instead sneered cruelly.

Yang Kai snorted, curling his lips in scorn. “Brother Xu, where does this sudden, inexplicable confidence of yours come from? Have you failed to see the whole picture? There are two people on our side.”
