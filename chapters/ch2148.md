## Chapter 2148 — Two Seasons Mountain

The entire Four Seasons Land was divided into the Four Great Territories of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each with its own environment and complex climate. The places where two territories met were especially peculiar.

As for the Two Seasons Mountain, it ran through the whole of Four Seasons Land like a continuous dividing line, separating the four closely connected regions.

All this information was something Yang Kai had seen in a jade slip before, so when Hua Qingsi mentioned the Two Seasons Mountain, he wasn’t too surprised.

However... judging from what Hua Qingsi revealed, the Qingyang Shrine was still hiding some things from him—at the very least, they hadn’t shared any information about the Time Temple.

That was only natural, since he was, after all, an outsider.

Murong Xiaoxiao handing him the jade slip that recorded most of the information about Four Seasons Land was probably done with Gao Xueting’s tacit approval. Anything more would be leaking Sect secrets.

Still, Yang Kai was certain that the people from Qingyang Shrine all knew about the Time Temple—if it really existed!

On the map Hua Qingsi gave him, the location of the Time Temple was marked right on the Two Seasons Mountain between the Summer and Winter Territories, so for Yang Kai, this trip was really just along the way.

He put away the map, had Hua Qingsi hide inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, summoned his wooden boat, and sped off in the direction of the Winter Territory.

In a rush, a day passed, and suddenly a long mountain range appeared ahead. From a distance, the forested mountains were lush and green, the valleys deep and the woods thick. On his side, the sun blazed fiercely, but the mountaintops were covered in silver, blanketed in snow.

On the other side of the mountains, which Yang Kai couldn’t see, it was surely an extremely cold world.

This was clearly the Two Seasons Mountain.

Without much hesitation, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings as he plunged straight in.

The jungle was stiflingly hot, but for a cultivator like Yang Kai, it didn’t have much effect.

He kept the information from the map in mind, searching for the Time Temple while making sure not to stray from the direction of the Winter Territory.

He was clear-headed about it—since the Time Temple was so elusive that almost no one found it during the Four Seasons Land’s openings, he couldn’t get his hopes up, lest he waste time and energy.

For him, finding it would be great. If not, it didn’t matter; he’d just cross the Two Seasons Mountain and enter the Winter Territory.

The Calamity Fruit was his real goal this time.

With this take-it-or-leave-it attitude, Yang Kai felt at ease, piloting his wooden boat in low flight.

In the forest, there seemed to be traces of Demonic Beasts, but none were very strong. Yang Kai had no interest in bothering them. Occasionally, he found a rare medicinal herb, which he carefully collected and transplanted into the medicine garden of the Small Xuan Realm.

Half a day passed in a flash. Though he didn’t find any sign of the Time Temple, it wasn’t a fruitless trip.

At one moment, as he flew low and scanned the area, his expression suddenly changed and he looked up in a certain direction.

From afar came a rustling chase that drew steadily nearer, as if something was fleeing at full speed through the woods. Yet the dense jungle blocked his sight, and Yang Kai could only catch vague shadows without seeing clearly.

Releasing his Divine Sense, he immediately sensed an aura about the strength of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm coming from that direction.

But at this moment, the owner of that aura was clearly badly wounded, their energy fluctuations extremely unstable.

As Yang Kai investigated, a Demonic Beast suddenly leapt out of the forest ahead.

This Demonic Beast looked like a lizard dozens of times larger than normal, with a pointed head and long body. But on its back were two fiery red wings, and on its head was a diamond-shaped mark, as if branded by a hot iron—an extremely strange sight.

Who knew what kind of desperate fight it had just been in with someone or another Demonic Beast? One of its wings had been cut off, its tail was missing, and it was covered in blood, wounds everywhere, flesh torn open.

It pounced through the air in panic, not expecting Yang Kai to block its path. In the blink of an eye, the giant lizard’s eyes turned blood-red, and it opened its mouth to attack Yang Kai.

Yang Kai saw a scarlet flash, and a sharp force rushed at him.

He saw clearly that the giant lizard’s attack was to shoot out its long tongue, which was straight and sharp as a sword.

In a hurry, Yang Kai flickered aside, letting the tongue strike empty air. At the same time, his wrist trembled, and over a dozen Moon Blades shot precisely at the giant lizard.

The giant lizard was midair, unable to dodge. The Moon Blades slashed directly across its body.

But the lizard’s body was tough. Yang Kai’s hurried Moon Blades didn’t kill it instantly, only sent sparks flying from its skin and caused some minor injuries.

Carried by the force of the slashes, the giant lizard plunged straight downward.

Yang Kai’s expression sharpened. He stepped in the void, descending like a meteor, and in a flash overtook the lizard, closing in above its head.

In the next instant, he unleashed the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, his right fist turning into a dragon claw, which he clenched and smashed down hard on the lizard’s skull.

Boom—

With a resounding crack and the sickening crunch of splintering bone, the giant lizard’s body snapped at the neck into a right angle. Its scarlet tongue lolled out, bloodshot eyes bulging as its whole frame convulsed and thrashed, yet it could not escape its fate.

With a thud, the lizard’s corpse hit the ground, and Yang Kai landed lightly beside it.

This giant lizard was at least an Eleventh-Tier Demonic Beast, comparable to a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator. If it hadn’t been badly wounded already, Yang Kai wouldn’t have killed it so quickly.

It didn’t look like a rare exotic beast, but given its rank, its Inner Core should still be quite valuable.

Thinking this, Yang Kai bent down to extract its Inner Core.

But just then, a sudden change occurred. The diamond-shaped mark on the lizard’s forehead began to spin, as if it had come alive. In the next moment, it turned into a streak of light, left the lizard’s head, and shot toward Yang Kai.

Startled, Yang Kai pushed off with his foot and hurriedly retreated.

He thought the lizard had self-destructed or used some strange trick. After all, an Eleventh-Tier Demonic Beast had considerable intelligence and could pull off such stunts.

He moved fast, but the streak of light was faster; Yang Kai couldn’t dodge it. The light broke through his Origin Qi, circled his body, and landed on the back of his hand.

“What is this!” Yang Kai cried out in shock, his face pale.

The moment the light touched the back of his hand, he felt a burning pain, as if a hot iron had branded him. Panicked, he staggered back.

But soon, he realized he was overreacting.

The pain lasted only a moment, then faded, replaced by a cool, pleasant sensation.

Looking down, Yang Kai saw that the back of his right hand now bore a diamond-shaped mark identical to the one he’d seen on the lizard’s forehead.

Whoosh, whoosh—

In the next instant, several figures suddenly appeared not far from Yang Kai, all of them staring at the lizard’s corpse before turning unfriendly eyes on him.

Yang Kai was startled. When he’d sensed the lizard’s injuries, he’d guessed someone was chasing it, but the mark’s distraction had kept him from noticing these people approach.

Now that he noticed, it was already too late.

“It’s you!”

“It’s you?”

Among the cultivators staring at Yang Kai, two voices cried out at once, though their tones were different.

Yang Kai looked up and immediately felt a headache coming on…

He suddenly realized the situation was more complicated than it first appeared.

The cultivators who had chased the giant lizard weren’t from a single faction—they’d come in four separate groups.

He actually recognized half of them.

On his left were Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao from Qingyang Shrine. He didn’t know if they’d been together the whole time or just met by chance. Back in the Summer Territory, they’d been separated by the Flame Beast’s pursuit, but now they both appeared here in the Two Seasons Mountain.

At this moment, Xiao Baiyi looked at Yang Kai with his usual cold indifference, not at all friendly. Murong Xiaoxiao, on the other hand, gave Yang Kai a sweet smile.

Next to them was the Yin-Yang Twin Body—Wuchang from Tianwu Sacred Land!

Yang Kai remembered this guy well. After seeing his fight with Xia Sheng, Yang Kai had decided that unless absolutely necessary, he’d never get into a conflict with him. Not out of fear, but because Wuchang was just too troublesome. Yang Kai figured that if he wanted to win, he’d have to go all out, and even then, he might not be able to kill him.

On the Tianwu Sacred Land side, only Wuchang was present.

That wasn’t surprising. Wuchang was violent and unpredictable. Even his fellow Senior Brothers found him hard to get along with. The disciples of Tianwu Sacred Land probably didn’t want to, or even dare to, team up with him. Wuchang himself preferred to act alone—everyone else was just a burden!

The third group was a man and a woman. The man was handsome and elegant, the woman beautiful. The man had the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, while the woman was only at the First Stage.

Yang Kai didn’t know who they were, but what struck him was that the man’s gaze was a bit gloomy when he looked at Yang Kai, while the woman smiled.

Judging by the patterns on their clothes, the pair were disciples of Star God Palace—not to be underestimated.

The last group, like Wuchang, was a lone individual.

Yang Kai glanced at him and saw that he wasn’t from a major Sect. The emblem on his clothes was unfamiliar, so he was probably from a mid-tier or even minor force.

Yet, facing the elite disciples of the three great Sects, this guy showed no fear, his expression calm to the extreme—truly surprising.
