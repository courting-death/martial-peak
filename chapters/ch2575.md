## Chapter 2575 — Xiaoxiao’s Kin

Upon hearing this, the group of yao exchanged strange looks and glanced at Yang Kai, muttering to themselves about the so-called Xiaoxiao—“the little one.” That fellow was clearly a giant, wasn’t he? They wondered whether this human was blind. Even with the Soul-Locking Chains suppressing him, that hulking brute could grow even larger; without them, he might very well bring the entire underground palace crashing down.

Before their thoughts could finish, Yang Kai had already stepped forward, striding boldly toward the monster. His eyes were filled with complex emotions, as if the whole world had faded away, leaving only that creature.

Xie Wuwei was startled and called out in a low voice, “Young Master Yang, be careful! This thing is vicious and possesses boundless strength. Please step aside and let this king handle it!”

He had no idea what Yang Kai was planning, but he knew firsthand how troublesome that monster was. Back when he tried to subdue it, his own men suffered heavy casualties, and even he was beaten so badly he coughed up three pints of blood, nearly losing his life.

If not for its formidable strength and his desire to tame it, Xie Wuwei would have killed it long ago, rather than keeping it imprisoned here.

Yang Kai, a First Stage Emperor, approached so recklessly—even with the Soul-Locking Chains restraining it, he was unlikely to escape unscathed.

Yang Kai ignored him and continued forward.

Xie Wuwei frowned and was about to step forward to block him, but Zhang Ruoxi moved, positioning herself in front of him and raising a hand to stop him.

“Miss, what is the meaning of this?” Xie Wuwei looked gloomily at Zhang Ruoxi. For a mere Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator to act so boldly toward him—if not for his soul imprint being controlled, he would have slapped her aside already.

Ruoxi remained calm and replied, “Since sir acts this way, he must have his own plans. Yao King, it’s best to watch and see.”

She didn’t know what Yang Kai intended, nor why he suddenly stepped forward, but out of blind trust in him, she didn’t want anyone to disturb him.

Xie Wuwei was frustrated, thinking that if he weren’t now a soul slave, his life and Yang Kai’s safety intertwined, he wouldn’t care about Yang Kai’s fate at all.

He stood there with an unpleasant expression, secretly channeling his Yao Yuan, ready to rush in and rescue at any moment. He also signaled his subordinates to act quickly if anything went wrong.

The yao were anxious, watching intently. Yang Kai had already reached the massive creature.

It wasn’t Xiaoxiao…

Staring at the five zhang tall Stone Giant before him, Yang Kai’s excitement gradually faded. He realized this Stone Giant was not his Xiaoxiao. There was a mysterious spiritual connection between him and Xiaoxiao—if this Stone Giant were truly him, he would have sensed it long ago.

Most crucially, even at such close range, the Stone Giant continued to roar in fury, desperate to kill him, struggling madly against the chains, making them clatter noisily.

“Roar…” The Stone Giant bellowed, a fierce wind blasting Yang Kai’s face, distorting his features. The underground palace was filled with flying sand and stones, the walls rumbling as if they might collapse at any moment.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense, attempting to communicate, but found the creature was in a state of rage, completely ignoring him.

Helpless, he spoke: “Are you Xiaoxiao’s kin?”

Encountering a Stone Giant identical to Xiaoxiao’s transformed state in such a place, Yang Kai couldn’t help but make connections. Perhaps Xiaoxiao and the Incarnation weren’t the only Stone Puppets in the world—maybe there was an entire unique tribe. Maybe Xiaoxiao sensed his kin here and entered the Wild Ancient Land!

Perhaps the creature even knew Xiaoxiao.

“Roar…”

The only reply was another furious roar, making the yao group tremble in fear. They thought this human was truly bold—facing a Stone Giant that even the Yao King struggled against, he remained so calm.

If nothing else, his courage alone was enough to command respect from the yao.

Though he was a bit foolish… Who knew if he’d be smashed into a meat patty soon?

“Have you seen him?” Yang Kai pointed, conjuring an image of Xiaoxiao before him.

The image clearly showed Xiaoxiao as he was when they parted years ago—simple-minded, lively eyes, only half a person tall, his stone skin sharply defined, as if clad in stone armor, looking incredibly sturdy.

Most notably, he carried a pitch-black staff on his shoulder, one hand resting on it, the other shading his brow as he gazed into the distance.

The roaring Stone Giant suddenly quieted, its angry eyes fixed on the phantom image, then looked up at Yang Kai, the fury fading and confusion appearing.

Xiaoxiao, carrying the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, was simply too distinctive.

“You’ve seen him, haven’t you?” Yang Kai observed, his expression brightening.

The Stone Giant was silent for a while, then slowly nodded.

As expected!

Overjoyed, Yang Kai hurriedly asked, “Where is Xiaoxiao now? Is he well?”

He was desperate to know Xiaoxiao’s situation. When they parted in the Starlight Passage, he felt guilty. Liu Yan was quickly found, and even Chi Yue and the others had been located and were now cultivating in Thousand Leaves Sect, but Xiaoxiao remained missing.

The Star Realm was perilous, and he didn’t know how Xiaoxiao was faring—especially after hearing from Yin Lesheng that Xiaoxiao had entered the Wild Ancient Land, his heart was even more anxious.

Now, with a clue about Xiaoxiao, how could he not be delighted?

He wished he could dive into the Stone Giant’s head to check on Xiaoxiao.

The Stone Giant opened its mouth and rumbled, “What are you to the little one?”

Its words were unclear, obviously not used to speaking, and its voice thundered through the palace, making it hum.

The yao were stunned, staring ahead in disbelief, inwardly wailing—the big guy actually spoke! They’d always thought it lacked intelligence and couldn’t communicate, but now realized it simply didn’t bother with them.

Xie Wuwei’s eyes widened in shock.

By now, he understood that Yang Kai and the Stone Giant had some connection; otherwise, Yang Kai wouldn’t have calmed its rage so easily and made it speak. This Stone Giant was the one he’d worked so hard to capture—would Yang Kai blame him later?

Xie Wuwei felt deeply uneasy. If Yang Kai truly chose to vent his anger on him, then in front of so many subordinates, how could he possibly save face?

He considered whether he should have his men withdraw to avoid embarrassment later.

“Little one…” Yang Kai grinned, realizing the Stone Giant meant Xiaoxiao, and nodded, “He was hatched from my own Essence-Blood and raised by me.”

No need for further explanation—those two sentences were enough.

The Stone Giant nodded and rumbled, “So the esteemed one the elder spoke of is you!”

“Elder…” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, surprised by the sudden mention, but didn’t press further. He simply asked, “Is Xiaoxiao well? Has he encountered any danger these years?”

The Stone Giant rumbled, “Since you are the little one’s benefactor, you are a guest of my tribe. There’s no need to hide anything from you. The little one found his tribe years ago, and they accepted him. He is very safe now.”

“You have your own tribe?” Yang Kai was shocked. Though he’d suspected, confirmation still amazed him. The Stone Puppet clan was naturally impervious to weapons and possessed immense strength—at their peak, even one was hard to deal with. If there were a group…

Even Divine Spirits would have to retreat.

The Stone Giant said proudly, “Though our Stone Spirit Race is few in number, we are far from extinction. Honored guest, there’s no need to be so surprised.”

Stone Spirit Race…

Yang Kai was speechless. It seemed calling them the Stone Puppet Race was incorrect—they called themselves the Stone Spirit Race. But it was just a name, nothing important.

“Can you take me to see Xiaoxiao?” Yang Kai asked again.

The Stone Giant fell silent for a moment, then said, “You want to take the little one away? He is now a member of the tribe and cannot leave with you. Our Stone Spirit Race is not bound by anyone. Those who covet us are enemies.”

Yang Kai smiled, “I just want to see him, not take him away.”

The Stone Giant looked him up and down, then nodded, “You’re not lying…”

Yang Kai was startled—could it really tell if he was lying? He didn’t know much about the Stone Spirit Race, nor if they had any special abilities besides refining ores.

“I can grant your request, honored guest, but right now…” The Stone Giant spoke, tugging at the chains binding its limbs, making them clatter, indicating it was powerless to help.

“That’s easy to fix.” Yang Kai replied, turning back, “Yao King, please come over.”

Xie Wuwei’s mouth twitched, reluctantly walking over.

He had heard the conversation between Yang Kai and the Stone Giant clearly and knew what Yang Kai wanted him to do. He had finally managed to capture the Stone Giant and imprison it, hoping to make it serve him. Who could have expected Yang Kai to appear out of nowhere?

“Young Master Yang, what are your orders?” Xie Wuwei asked in a low voice, feigning formality.

Yang Kai tilted his head, “Release him!”

“This…” Xie Wuwei hesitated.

The Stone Giant glared at him, as if he were a mortal enemy.

Xie Wuwei said bitterly, “Young Master Yang, it’s not that I’m unwilling, but look at him—if I release him, he’ll surely cause trouble for me. This patch of land will be lost, and if he goes wild, my mountain will be flattened.”
