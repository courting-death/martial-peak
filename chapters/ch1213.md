## Chapter 1213 — He Displeases Him

When Yang Kai actually rejected him, the cultivator from the Battle Sky Alliance's face chilled and he sneered, "Alright, alright — a mute and an ugly woman, you two truly are a match made by heaven and earth. Want me to set you up and make a good match?"

A faint flush passed over the woman's sallow face; her mood, which had calmed somewhat, flared once more into anger — she seemingly could not stand to hear the words "ugly woman," and the moment she heard them her temper would change drastically.

“No need to play matchmaker. I already have a wife—no need for you to meddle in such matters,” Yang Kai suddenly sneered.

The Battle Sky Alliance cultivator was taken aback for a moment, then laughed aloud, "So you're not mute after all. Never mind what I said. Kid, scram to the side — this is no place for you."

He could also tell Yang Kai meant mischief; though he wasn't afraid, he issued a quiet warning.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai remained indifferent. The ripples of Saint Yuan surged; a pitch-black longsword wreathed in flame slowly condensed in his hand. Seeing this, the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator's face darkened and he growled ominously, "What, you intend to attack me? Think carefully — if you dare make a move, you'll die!"

"Whether I die or not is none of your concern, but you—you're a dead man," Yang Kai replied. "Your mouth stinks up ten li; I can hardly stand it. I'll just borrow a bit of your life for a moment!" As he spoke, he lightly brought the Demonic Flame longsword down in a slash.

One after another, Profound Heaven Sword radiances shot from the tip of the Demonic Flame longsword. Those inky sword gleams contained earth-shattering might; in an instant a dozen blades sealed off all retreat for the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator.

The moment Yang Kai struck, the Alliance cultivator's expression changed drastically — how could he not sense the power of an attack released by someone at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm? No longer caring to tussle with the woman, he withdrew the Saint Yuan he had poured into his Secret Treasure long spear, and surges of dense power welled from his body, coalescing before him into the form of a shield.

Boom, boom, boom...

The sword radiance struck that shield. After only two blows it shattered into fragments; the remaining sword momentum was unabated, and the blades swarmed forward.

The Battle Sky Alliance cultivator screamed in alarm and tried to evade, but the woman whose hand had been freed flicked white threads, instantly binding him in place. Those white strands were made of some unknown material, so sharp they hardly seemed natural. Looping around him again and again, she triggered her Saint Yuan and the threads suddenly tightened.

Light flickered across the man's body as his protective armor erupted with defensive power, yet it still could not withstand the strands' cutting. The sound of slicing rang out, and a dozen blood lines appeared across the Alliance cultivator's body.

"No..." he only had time for one terrified cry before his body was sliced into a dozen pieces by those white threads.

Before his corpse even fell, Yang Kai's inky sword radiance had swept across and burned the remains to ash.

An elite disciple of the Battle Sky Alliance at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — under the joint assault of Yang Kai and the woman — didn't even manage a single breath before his soul was scattered and gone. Yang Kai was not surprised by the result; even alone he had confidence he could kill the man. He had merely given the woman an opening.

Yet the potency of the woman's white strands exceeded his expectations — otherwise he would not have released so many sword radiances.

The woman herself seemed astonished at the method Yang Kai had displayed. After the effortless slaying of the Alliance cultivator she couldn't help but glance at him; her eyes flickered, almost as if they could speak.

Only then did Yang Kai notice that the woman's figure was exceptionally fine, and that her pair of eyes were lively and full of a kind of ineffable spirit. If she hid her face and left only those eyes visible, any man would surely go mad.

"What a pity about the looks..." Yang Kai thought, but his face did not change in the slightest.

"Thank you!" After killing his opponent she exhaled heavily; her ample bosom rose and fell in an exaggerated manner, then fell again in a breathtaking arc. She offered Yang Kai a slight nod and forced out a faint smile as she thanked him. The smile was sincere, though her appearance made it hard to compliment.

But her voice was melodious and soft, tender and sweet — utterly pleasing to the ear.

"It's nothing, I just couldn't stand him," Yang Kai replied indifferently.

"Don't worry — I won't tell anyone about this. And since I killed him, it has nothing to do with you. If the Battle Sky Alliance really investigates, you won't be implicated." The woman took all the responsibility upon herself, which gained Yang Kai's goodwill; he felt his earlier intervention hadn't been wasted.

As she spoke she took the ring from the severed arm that had fallen to the ground, and without looking at its contents tossed it to Yang Kai. "This is for you."

Yang Kai didn't bother with courtesy, caught it casually, and slipped it into his bosom.

The woman thought for a moment, her face reddening, then turned and reached into her bosom. She produced a crimson fruit and also tossed it over. "You were probably chasing this, right?"

Yang Kai accepted it with an awkward smile. "I didn't know it was yours to keep."

The fruit was warm to the touch, perhaps because it had been kept against her body, or because of some property of the fruit itself. Yang Kai even detected a faint, pleasant fragrance emanating from it that eased the spirit.

"I understand," the woman nodded. "My spirit fox may not be useful in battle, but it's naturally able to find certain Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines. It found one and you happened upon it — it's only natural you'd chase after it."

As she spoke the woman frowned, suddenly remembering that her spirit fox was extremely fast — someone outside might have chased after it, but in here no one could fly. How did Yang Kai catch up? With the spirit fox's speed it should have left him behind long ago.

But she didn't press the matter. If he could catch up to a spirit fox, he surely had his tricks; asking too much would only become tiresome. Though not conventionally beautiful, she was naturally refined and knew some things were best left unsaid.

"Spirit fox?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow — he had never heard of such a demonic beast before, though beasts capable of finding Spiritual Herbs and Medicines did exist. The spirit fox was likely one of those rare creatures, normally kept by sects to hunt for treasures.

"Yes, it grew up with me." She smiled more naturally than before when speaking of the spirit fox, reached out to stroke the little beast's head as it poked out of her bosom, and then seemed to remember something. "Do you want to come with me to look for the Golden Sun Fruit tree? Since the spirit fox found one Golden Sun Fruit, there must be a fruit tree — and there will surely be more than one fruit on it. How about we split them fifty-fifty?"

She clearly disliked owing favors. Yang Kai had helped her earlier; though she had already given him the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator's ring and the Golden Sun Fruit, she still felt it insufficient and so made the proposal.

The suggestion suited Yang Kai perfectly — he had long had designs on that elusive Golden Sun Fruit tree but lacked leads. Now that the woman brought it up voluntarily, he agreed at once. "Fine."

He could see that the woman was decent, hence his ready acceptance. Otherwise, given her cultivation at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, she would not have proposed an equal split.

With the agreement reached, the woman released the spirit fox. She whispered something into its ear; the creature retraced its steps at once, and Yang Kai and the woman followed in pursuit.

Yang Kai spent about half an hour trailing the spirit fox, but by the time it led them to where the Golden Sun Fruit tree grew it had been over an hour, because the woman's pace was slow.

There really was a Golden Sun Fruit tree nearby, its location extremely concealed, in a little valley surrounded by mountains. On a patch of land near the foot of a cliff grew the Golden Sun Fruit tree, three zhang tall, vigorous and unbowed even under waves of heat.

In such a spot only a beast specialized in seeking Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines would notice it. Even a passing cultivator would miss it unless they investigated thoroughly.

Yang Kai and the woman had walked in silence all the way, neither asking the other's name or origin — both knew they'd part ways after this cooperation, so there was no need for prying questions.

Now they stood beneath the Golden Sun Fruit tree, both staring in awe at the heavy, tempting fruits hanging from its branches.

A quick count showed at least thirty fruits on the tree, each a tempting crimson; several others had ripened and fallen to the ground, perhaps a dozen more.

No one knew how many years that Golden Sun Fruit tree had been growing here, nor how many fruits had been wasted through the years.

After a long look, the woman turned to Yang Kai and said, "I'll have the spirit fox pick them all down and then we'll divide them."

"Fine!" Yang Kai had no objection.

At her command the fox-like creature scrambled up the Golden Sun Fruit tree and began moving about; fruits tumbled down from the branches one by one.

The woman's face lit with delight as she caught each falling fruit in her hands.

When the tree was bare she gathered up the fruits that had fallen to the ground and divided all of them into two piles, telling Yang Kai, "There are forty-four in total — we each get twenty-two."

Yang Kai nodded lightly and stored his share in his Spatial Ring.

After splitting the fruits the woman said, "In any case, thanks for your help this time. If there's a chance later, I'll return the favor."

"No need — these Golden Sun Fruits are enough," Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. He had only helped casually, yet the woman's gratitude made him a bit embarrassed.

The woman thought a moment and did not press further. "Since that's settled, I'll be off first."

"All right. I'll uproot this tree and bring it along!" Yang Kai did not hide his plan — such a tree might have stood here for years; transplanting it back to Dragon Lair Mountain could let it bloom and bear fruit again. Dragon Lair Mountain lacked Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines; bringing a fruit tree back would add some charm.
