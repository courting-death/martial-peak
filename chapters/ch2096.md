## Chapter 2096 — Bloody Battle

"How can this be?" Their eyes nearly popped from their sockets; everyone's mouths hung open, unable to close for a long time.

The regeneration of severed limbs was something heard of only in legends; only those few rare Spiritual Medicines that had long since vanished from the world could accomplish such a heaven-defying effect, and even an Emperor Realm warrior could not, by sheer personal might, restore a severed limb.

Yet now, such a scene had appeared before everyone.

The one accomplishing it was nothing more than a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm warrior.

Who would not be astonished?

The creatures they'd encountered before were uneven in strength — all below the Dao Origin Realm and no match for the seven acting together; they exploded into fragments at a single touch, so no one had noticed that the boundless Demonic Qi could have such a terrifying effect on the creatures.

Yet that demon Cheng could actually draw on the Demonic Qi to make a severed arm regrow in the space of a breath. Astonishment flickered across everyone's faces, but beneath it they all felt a cold prick of unease — this was going to be troublesome.

"It looks like we have to strike at their vital points, or simply shatter them outright," Duan Yuanshan said in a deep voice.

"This Lord wants to see how many times you can dodge!" The Fu family man, having failed in his strike, grew irate and ashamed; with a twist of his wrist the short spear reappeared, and he poured Origin Qi into it desperately.

The short spear quivered minutely, then divided into two, two into four, four into eight…

Each short spear looked nearly identical, as though they were all Middle-Level Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasures. Whether it was a divine art he himself grasped or the Secret Treasure's power was unclear.

"Go!" he barked, and the eight short spears trembled and suddenly vanished from everyone's sight.

In the next moment the two City Lords of Musen City lurched, and another figure burst out from the side. He formed hand seals with both hands; Demonic Qi surged massively, and a mysterious force condensed in the sky, sweeping forward to cover the area.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh…

Whistling cracks tore through the air. Great clouds of blood-mist burst from the two Musen City Lords, leaving them mangled and utterly humiliated.

When the eight short spears reappeared in Fu's hands, his expression was darker than before.

Ahead, the two Musen City Lords were grievously wounded. One had been pierced through the chest and lungs — a fist-sized hole gaped in his torso, you could almost see straight through, his internal organs faintly writhing within.

The other's legs were completely severed; he fell to the ground and struggled to get up.

Yet even such horrific wounds were not fatal; as the Demonic Qi rolled, the scene of severed limbs regenerating replayed.

Before long, the two Musen City Lords stood before everyone again, unharmed.

And at that moment, besides those two, there was another figure who appeared to be an old man.

"Jiang Taisheng!" Duan Yuanshan snorted coldly, full of loathing for the culprit who had endangered Fenglin City.

That demonic old man was clearly the Jiang Family's Patriarch, Jiang Taisheng, but he was now somewhat different from the last time Yang Kai had seen him — he had completely degenerated into something like a demon, and his aura was far stronger than before.

It had been he who had just acted to shield the two Musen City Lords from many attacks; otherwise, given Fu's ability, at least one of them should have been cut down.

"You bastards have successfully angered me; I will make you pay!" Fu nearly exploded with rage; a burning fire rose within him as he shouted and frantically stirred his Origin Qi, cupping his palm as a fireball-like Secret Art materialized in his hand, growing hotter and brighter as he poured more Origin Qi into it.

"Impossible!" Duan Yuanshan's face changed in alarm.

Everyone's internal strength had already been heavily consumed, and after Fu's previous actions they were even more stretched thin; seeing him about to unleash another massively draining Secret Art, Duan Yuanshan would not allow it.

It would be fine if he used a Secret Art, but now that the seven people's Origin Qi was unified, any Secret Art he used would require the seven to supply the energy together, far less safe and efficient than relying on the Black Tortoise seven-segment formation.

"He's lost his mind; he'll not listen," Hua Qingsi said, her pretty face shifting, and she cried sharply, "If you don't want the array to collapse, hurry and take the Blood-Returning Origin Pill!"

With that she immediately produced the pill Yang Kai had handed her and shoved it into her mouth.

Seeing this, the others no longer hesitated and swallowed their Spiritual Pills as well.

It was Yang Kai’s first time taking such a pill. The moment it settled in his stomach a wave of searing heat spread through his abdomen, agony so sharp he could barely bear it. At the same time, a portion of his precious Essence-Blood suddenly ignited, triggering the Pill’s medicinal power and turning it into pure Origin Qi that poured into his emptied meridians.

His eyes brightened involuntarily as he realized this pill was truly valuable.

Pills that replenished Origin Qi existed in quantity across the Star Realm, but none were likely better or faster in effect than the Blood-Returning Origin Pill.

However, swallowing it would consume a portion of one's Essence-Blood — a not-insubstantial side effect; as a rule, when Essence-Blood is expended, one's vitality would be noticeably sapped.

Once the pill's effects ran their course, everyone would inevitably be weakened to some degree.

At that moment, Fu, as if maddened, curled his lips into a feral, cold smile. The fireball he cupped flared like a tiny sun, its blistering heat making everyone around writhe with discomfort.

Unexpectedly, the Demonic Qi near the spot was also burned clean by the blazing heat — an unanticipated benefit.

"Die, scum!" Fu shouted, and tossed the sun-like fireball.

Feeling the terrifying power contained within, Duan Yuanshan and the others turned pale; without thinking they formed hand seals and shouted, "Defend!"

Drawn by the formation's tug, everyone hastily fell into place and moved in concert.

The Black Tortoise image suddenly contracted significantly, and on its shell a Turtle Shell-shaped presence appeared out of thin air, patterned with complex, mottled designs. In that instant the Black Tortoise shadow almost solidified, giving those sheltered within a rare sense of security.

Ahead, Jiang Taisheng and the other two demons snarled, emitting waves of agitation as though realizing calamity approached; they all opened their mouths wide, inhaling the surrounding Demonic Qi.

In the blink of an eye, the Demonic Qi where the three stood thickened far more than before.

The little sun descended, landing squarely among the three demons.

Blinding light flared forth; almost everyone closed their eyes at that moment, unable to look upon the scene.

Boom…

Only then did the ear-splitting explosion roar out.

The sky went dark, sand and stone flew; the wind howled; the earth hummed.

The already collapsing mine tunnel was nearly destroyed utterly.

“Hahahahaha! Let’s see if you can survive this!” Fu laughed wildly, producing a Blood-Returning Origin Pill and shoving it into his mouth to chew, his features savage and nearly deranged.

As the light gradually dispersed, a vast pit some ten or so zhang deep had opened on the ground ahead, its rim strewn with still-burning embers.

Within the great pit, three figures flickered.

Fu's cackling abruptly cut off; he stared forward in disbelief, utterly incredulous.

Inside the pit the Demonic Qi had already been utterly purged, so everything could be seen clearly.

The three demons who should have been annihilated without a trace were now in a wretched, maimed state — yet astonishingly, none of them had died.

Instead, they continued greedily drawing in the Demonic Qi surging from all directions, attempting to mend their bodies.

Yet the flames consuming them burned ever fiercer, and the Demonic Qi had barely reached their skin before it was scorched into drifting black smoke by that searing power.

"They can't regrow their limbs again; if we don't strike now, when will we?" Duan Yuanshan cried in delight and first unleashed his Secret Treasure, throwing caution about Origin Qi consumption to the wind as he launched a fierce assault.

The others, seeing this, did not hesitate and either used Secret Arts or awakened their Secret Treasures' powers in concert.

From the pit Jiang Taisheng and the other two demons roared as they lunged out, allowing the flames to rage over their bodies while dodging the crowd's Secret Arts and Secret Treasure attacks, quickly closing the distance; their red-black eyes shone with madness.

"They want to perish with us? Stop them!" Hua Qingsi's delicate features flickered; her lithe form spun gracefully, and with a clear, ringing cry she called, "Butterfly Dance!"

In that instant she seemed to become a flitting butterfly, nimble and beautiful.

Dozens upon dozens of multicolored butterflies suddenly shot out from her body, beating their wings and sweeping forward like a sky-darkening tide, numbering in the hundreds.

When those charmingly colored butterflies neared the demons' bodies they emitted violent power fluctuations and self-destructed; each explosion approximated the self-destructive force of a Third Stage of the Void King Realm warrior.

Hundreds of butterflies exploded together, a spectacular display.

The already heavily wounded three demons were in even graver peril.

"Slash!" Qin Chaoyang's long blade became a towering radiance and slashed downward.

The demon Cheng who had leapt into the crowd three zhang ahead was cleaved in two by the blow and fell to the ground, finally dead.

Zhuang Pan and Du Lishen, sensing this was a life-or-death moment, dared not hold back; they unleashed their utmost techniques without reserve, surging forward to intercept Jiang Taisheng and Zhou.

Yang Kai's long sword — the Undying Five Elements Sword — poured out an inexhaustible stream of sword qi, the currents linking end to end as they surged at the demon Zhou in a continuous barrage, nearly riddling him like a hornet's nest.

"Dragon Emperor Flash!" Duan Yuanshan pressed his hands together and thrust forward.

Accompanied by a resounding dragon cry, a dragon shadow lunged out like the last straw to crush a camel, striking the demon Zhou's chest and tearing his already broken body into several pieces, which fell down from the sky.

"Where is Jiang Taisheng?" Qin Chaoyang's expression suddenly changed as he called in a low voice.

Amidst the chaos he realized Jiang Taisheng had vanished.

Everyone was terrified in their hearts and quickly turned to look in all directions.

"Here!" Yang Kai cried in a low voice; relying on his mastery of spatial forces he keenly seized Jiang Taisheng's trace, and with a tremor his long sword shot forth as a streak of light.

Pfft…

Jiang Taisheng's figure reappeared oddly, but the sword pierced his heart.

But to everyone's dismay and astonishment, Jiang Taisheng had already lunged forward — though struck by a mortal wound, a cold, cutting smile curled at the corner of his mouth. In the next moment, extremely unstable energy fluctuations emanated from within him.
