## Chapter 1766 — You Bastard

Xue Yue’s completely unreasonable and relentless behavior ignited a blaze of fury within Yang Kai.

He fixed her with a cold, dark stare for a moment. Yang Kai snorted, stepped toward her, and a ferocious light shot from his eyes, making Xue Yue's face change slightly.

The next instant Yang Kai reached out and pulled Xue Yue's soft, delicate form into his arms; to her stunned and terrified astonishment he bent down and kissed her thin, tender lips, while one hand covered her breasts and massaged them fiercely, his movements brutal with not a hint of gentleness.

"It hurts, you bastard!" Xue Yue cried in panic, thrusting both hands to shove Yang Kai, but no matter how hard she pushed she could not move him an inch; his towering body pressed against her like a majestic mountain, immovable.

Amid the pain, another strange sensation spread throughout her body...

A whimper slipped out; Xue Yue struggled a few times, and then her body quickly went limp.

Around them the Illusory Void Butterfly beat their wings with a buzzing sound, those multicolored shadows fluttering to envelop the two of them.

Blood Beasts fought fiercely, the Jade-Green Giant Dragon issued raucous draconic roars...

After a long while, their lips parted.

Yang Kai pushed Xue Yue away, glancing at her with an expression that discarded her like refuse.

Xue Yue's cheeks were flushed red, a rosy color staining her long, fair neck; her body still seemed soft and unsteady, and after leaving Yang Kai's embrace she staggered slightly, but now she looked about furtively, her gaze unfocused, no longer wearing that aggressive posture.

"Satisfied?" Yang Kai snorted.

"You..." Xue Yue's face burned crimson; she opened her mouth but did not know what to say.

“Damn it, enough already!” Yang Kai cursed angrily. “Of all times, you just had to come pester me with this now. Truly insufferable!”

Xue Yue immediately put on an aggrieved look, her eyes reddening as if she were about to cry, but she quickly composed herself and took a deep breath. Gritting her teeth she said, "So what if it's senseless? At least I got what I wanted."

"That's what you wanted?" Yang Kai sneered at her.

"So what if it is?" Xue Yue pressed her lips together. "Besides my father and a few Commerce Guild elders, only you know I'm a woman. I don't want to reach death without ever having felt what it is to be a woman!"

Yang Kai suddenly realized why the woman had been so frenzied; no wonder she behaved like that.

“That’s right. You’re the one who said it—‘dying beneath the peony flower, even as a ghost one remains merry.’ So what’s wrong with letting me enjoy a bit of that romance?” Xue Yue giggled, her laughter as enchanting as a seductress in full bloom. “At the very least, if I really die here, I’ll die as a woman. That would count as fulfilling one of my wishes.”

"Truly incomprehensible," Yang Kai said, shaking his head slightly.

Xue Yue twisted her neck and hummed lightly, "Say whatever you like."

Once she had spoken plainly, Xue Yue seemed to relax considerably; she looked far more spirited, and a dazzling radiance returned to her face.

“Let’s make this clear first—this is all because you forced me. I won’t be taking responsibility.” Yang Kai raised a finger and waved it before Xue Yue, looking every bit the kind of man who would eat his fill and deny it afterward.

“Who wants you to take responsibility?” Xue Yue curled her lips. “I know you already have women—and more than one at that. But… as the saying goes, a wife is not as good as a concubine, and a concubine not as thrilling as an affair…”

"You know quite a bit," Yang Kai chuckled, then suddenly sighed and regarded Xue Yue solemnly. In a low voice he said, "You haven't had it easy either."

Xue Yue pouted. “Good, as long as you know.”

As she spoke she moved closer to Yang Kai and reached out her jade hand to him.

Yang Kai took her hand in his palm and teased, "What? Planning to join me in the Yellow Springs?"

"Since it's already like this, if you have any method then use it quickly. Otherwise your women might be widowed—I'm too weak to keep fighting," Xue Yue said indifferently, as if she had already made peace with death.

Yang Kai nodded and slipped his arm around Xue Yue's waist.

Seeing his inscrutable manner, Xue Yue's eyes brightened.

She had really prepared to die here, but judging by Yang Kai's bearing it was clear he still had energy; she could not help but reveal a glint of hope, silently wondering what trump card he had yet to play.

Yang Kai let out a low chuckle and was about to use Spatial Force to tear open space and escape with Xue Yue when he suddenly remembered something.

He paused, and then took that thing out.

It turned out to be a Secret Treasure shaped like a bracelet; its patina was ancient, clearly long-aged, and its surface was engraved with dense, countless complex runes.

Staring at the bracelet, Yang Kai glanced at the Illusory Void Butterfly swarming around them and felt a stirring in his heart; he channeled Saint Yuan into the bracelet.

The next moment the bracelet emitted a faint glow, its runes flickering for an instant as an extremely mysterious wave of power rippled outward!

An incredible sight occurred: as that wave swept out, the Illusory Void Butterfly that had been attacking the Blood Beasts seemed to meet their nemesis, fluttering and falling from the sky.

From the looks of it, the butterflies' power was being suppressed.

"What is that?" Xue Yue asked in surprise, staring at the bracelet in Yang Kai's hand.

Yang Kai said nothing and continued to channel Saint Yuan into it.

Another wave of force rolled out and sent more butterflies tumbling; in a short time, nearly half of the butterflies that had formed an impenetrable ring around them lost the ability to act, and the rest fled in terror.

"So this thing can be used like that," Yang Kai said, also surprised.

"What exactly is it?" Xue Yue asked again, examining the bracelet with Divine Sense but failing to determine what grade of Secret Treasure it truly was.

"Slave-Insect Bracelet!" Yang Kai answered casually. "Someone told me it has a divine effect that counters certain strange insects and beasts. I only thought to try it just now—didn't expect it to actually work."

The Slave-Insect Bracelet was an Imperial Treasure, forged by the Insect Emperor; countless fierce strange insects and beasts were sealed within it. After Yang Kai slew the Insect Emperor, this Slave-Insect Bracelet became his spoil, but because his cultivation had been insufficient he never dared refine it and so kept it in his Spatial Ring.

Yang Yan had told him that the Slave-Insect Bracelet was the Insect Emperor's famed treasure, its aura naturally countering strange insects and beasts, and from the current situation it was clear the Illusory Void Butterfly was being suppressed by the bracelet.

Even though Yang Kai had never refined the Slave-Insect Bracelet, merely stimulating a bit of its inherent power by pouring Saint Yuan into it could render the butterflies incapable of action!

The might of an Imperial Treasure could be glimpsed from this alone.

Yet because Yang Kai could not fully unleash its divine might, those butterflies were not killed; they merely instinctively feared the bracelet's aura, losing the will to move or attack.

The ground was covered with a thick layer of fallen Illusory Void Butterfly struggling helplessly, unable to take wing; more butterflies fled to the distance but did not disperse, forming a surrounding cordon that sealed off the nearby space.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, recalled his heavily depleted Blood Beast host, sheathed his Dragon Bone Sword, and, holding the Slave-Insect Bracelet high, kept pouring Saint Yuan into it as he strode forward with Xue Yue.

Wherever he passed the butterflies retreated, keeping a certain distance; if he drew near they would fall, and only after he had walked away would they rise again and resume their chase.

Xue Yue watched with mingled surprise and joy; though she had prepared to die, no one wanted to die if they could live, and now that she had opened up to Yang Kai she was full of hope for the future.

They had already advanced more than a hundred li without trouble, yet the Illusory Void Butterfly still did not disperse, lingering far behind Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

"These annoying things," Yang Kai frowned, feeling how troublesome these ancient ferocious beasts could be.

"Why not just kill them all?" Xue Yue suggested. With the Slave-Insect Bracelet suppressing them, the butterflies posed no real threat to her and Yang Kai now; it would only be a matter of time to finish them off.

"Too much trouble," Yang Kai shook his head, looked around, and after a moment brightened as he pointed toward a direction. "Go there!"

With that he vaulted off, taking Xue Yue and flying in that direction.

"Hey... what are you trying to do?" Xue Yue cried in alarm, for in front of them a rift in space gaped like a beast's maw, clearly visible and more than a hundred zhang in length, exuding a chilling aura.

And Yang Kai's chosen path aimed straight at that rift; he showed not the slightest intent to avoid it.

"What, you were just all sweet and vowed to join me in the Yellow Springs, now you're afraid?" Yang Kai grinned. "If you're scared, you can still leave now."

"Who's scared? Don't test my resolve!" Xue Yue bit her lip.

Saying so, she actually spurred her Saint Yuan in a fit of pique, dragging Yang Kai along as she charged straight toward the spatial rift.

Yang Kai made no move to stop her and let her act as she wished.

The two approached the rift at great speed and drew so near that Yang Kai could clearly sense Xue Yue's nervousness; after all, a vast spatial rift lay ahead, and who knew what would be encountered inside, or whether they could find their way back out.

In the instant before they crossed into the rift, Xue Yue turned her head to look at Yang Kai one last time, as if seeking final confirmation.

Receiving no denial from Yang Kai, she bit her lip and resolutely dragged him into the rift.

In the void a flash of light streaked, and the two were gone.

Only then did the chasing Illusory Void Butterfly halt, circle several times, and, after confirming there was no prey, swarm off en masse.
