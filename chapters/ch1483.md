## Chapter 1483 — Special Constitution

"Yes." Huang Juan replied as she accepted the Origin Condensing Pill from Yang Kai's hand, tucking it away carefully, a wave of emotion swelling in her chest.

Two months ago she was still scrambling to make ends meet, unable to afford even a single Spiritual Pill, but now she lived within the resplendent, qi-rich Lingxiao Sect, lacking neither cultivation resources nor miraculous items like Ten-Thousand-Year Incense and the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree to aid her breakthroughs.

In comparison, it was like heaven and earth. Each day, Huang Juan could hardly believe she was living such a life. Her gratitude toward Yang Kai grew ever deeper—for if he hadn’t brought her and Lin Yun’er back, she dared not even imagine what kind of fate would have awaited them.

"Sect Master called me here — is there any task you would assign?" Huang Juan asked respectfully, looking toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said nothing, instead turning his gaze to Ye Xijun.

Ever since Huang Juan brought Lin Yun'er here, Ye Xijun had been observing the little girl, her powerful Divine Sense silently enveloping Lin Yun'er; as if sensing something, astonishment and surprise flashed across her beautiful eyes.

"Has the Great Elder discovered something?" Yang Kai asked after a pause.

Ye Xijun inclined her head slightly and beckoned to Lin Yun'er, "Little girl, come here."

Strangely, despite Ye Xijun's solemn and exacting demeanor, Lin Yun'er showed no fear; after a brief hesitation she obediently stepped forward and stood before her.

"Don't be afraid." Ye Xijun offered a faint smile, reached out with her jade hand to grasp Lin Yun'er's wrist, and Saint Yuan immediately flowed like a fine stream into the girl's body as she carefully examined her.

As time passed, the expression on Ye Xijun's face grew increasingly peculiar.

After quite a while she inhaled deeply, released Lin Yun'er's wrist, and her eyes shone with amazement.

Huang Juan stood there, heart in her throat, watching Ye Xijun nervously, wondering if she had discovered anything. Since Yang Kai had told her about Lin Yun'er's oddity, Huang Juan had kept a closer eye and indeed found, as Yang Kai said, that within the little girl's slight frame there lay a vast power utterly incongruous with her age and size.

This power was of a purely physical constitution.

Huang Juan didn't know whether Lin Yun'er had some strange illness; after arriving at the Lingxiao Sect she had asked several elders, but none could offer a clear explanation, so she pinned her hopes on Ye Xijun, who now seemed deep in thought.

Rumor had it the Great Elder had once been the helmsman of Star Emperor Mountain and was widely experienced — why she had left Star Emperor Mountain to live in seclusion and then suddenly appear again to join the Lingxiao Sect was unknown.

"Great Elder, Yun'er — she..." Huang Juan grew more anxious as Ye Xijun remained silent.

"No need to worry." Ye Xijun reassured her lightly. "The little girl has no major issues, only that her constitution seems somewhat peculiar."

"A special constitution?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

"Indeed; otherwise it's hard to explain how vigorous her qi and blood are. But I cannot yet determine exactly what kind of constitution she has. I must consult the texts." Ye Xijun's brows knitted.

Yang Kai nodded slightly — that matched his own judgment.

He too suspected Lin Yun'er had a special constitution. Though rare, special constitutions do exist.

Yang Kai had encountered several: Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang's Medicinal Spirit Saint Body, the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo's Poison Widow constitution, and Xue Yue's Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body — all falling within the category of special constitutions.

Special constitutions are innate and grant wondrous effects.

For example, Xia Ningshang's Medicinal Spirit Saint Body made her a born alchemist; refining pills was instinctive, requiring no teacher, and she could use pill refinement to advance her own cultivation.

As for what kind of constitution Lin Yun'er possessed, no one knew, but whatever it was, it made her strength so formidable it seemed related to combat.

Yang Kai looked at her as if staring at an uncut jade!

The little girl's age was so young, her frame so frail, yet she possessed such power; if she were allowed to grow, in terms of raw strength she might leave even those yao famed for their physique far behind.

"Great Elder, if there's no objection, why not take on a disciple to teach? Not only would it ease your boredom, but you’d also have someone to honor you in the future—two birds with one stone.” Yang Kai suddenly said with a cheerful smile.

Ye Xijun cast him a sidelong glance and said coolly, “So that’s why the Sect Master called the little girl here—you were scheming against me all along.”

Yang Kai chuckled and replied candidly, "You know what our sect's situation is — aside from you, no one is capable. The little girl's special constitution would be harmed if others taught her; it's better to leave her with the Great Elder."

On hearing this Huang Juan brightened and hastened to plead.

Though she couldn't bear to be separated from Lin Yun'er, Huang Juan knew her own limitations; the girl's progress would be far better under Ye Xijun than under her. For the girl's future, a brief separation was acceptable.

Besides, the Great Elder resided within the Lingxiao Sect — they would still have chances to meet.

Huang Juan and Yang Kai spoke in concert, while Ye Xijun smiled wryly and rubbed her forehead. "If I refused outright, would that be too heartless?" she murmured.

“Subordinate wouldn’t dare. If the Great Elder has her reasons, I wouldn’t dare insist.” Huang Juan said in a panic.

"Sigh." Ye Xijun sighed. "It's not that I don't wish to accept her as a disciple, but given the girl's special constitution, until I understand it, my techniques may not suit her. Still... a bit of guidance won't hurt."

Huang Juan rejoiced.

"However, it depends on her own choice." Ye Xijun smiled and looked kindly at Lin Yun'er, her red lips parting as she asked, "Yun'er, will you follow me to cultivate?"

"I will." Unexpectedly, Lin Yun'er answered crisply without a moment's thought.

Ye Xijun was taken aback. "Why?"

"Because you seem very powerful." Lin Yun'er tilted her head.

Yang Kai and the others couldn't help laughing — though naive, the child had instinctively sensed who among them had the greatest cultivation.

Ye Xijun put on a stern air and warned in a deep voice, "Following me will be hard; if you don't train well, I'll beat you and scold you — do you understand?"

"Yun'er will train well and won't let you beat or scold me."

"Good." Ye Xijun nodded in satisfaction. "From today on, you will stay at Hundred Flowers Residence."

When Ye Xijun agreed, Huang Juan wept tears of joy and thanked her profusely.

Ye Xijun waved her hand and said, “I will merely guide her cultivation, not take her as a disciple. Please be sure that you and the Sect Master remember this.”

"I understand. Yun'er is fortunate to receive the Great Elder's guidance; whether you take her as a disciple matters little."

"Mm, no need to come to Hundred Flowers Residence unless necessary; I'll have Yun'er visit you of her own accord." Ye Xijun reminded them, then looked to Yang Kai. "If the Sect Master has no further business, please take your leave."

She was sending him away again……

Yang Kai, annoyed, rubbed his nose, stood, and left alone without waiting for the tearful Huang Juan to finish admonishing Lin Yun'er.

Five days later, within the palace housing the Lingxiao Sect’s spatial array outside the Flowing Flame Sandland, a flash of light flared, and Yang Kai appeared at the center of the formation. Without exchanging many words with the disciples guarding the place, he summoned his Star Shuttle and shot off toward the horizon, disappearing from sight in moments.

With the Lingxiao Sect now secure, no internal troubles and no external threats, he needed to prepare for his voyage.

It had been twenty to thirty years since he entered the star domain; everything on the Tongxuan Continent weighed on his mind, and with a Void King-Grade warship now in the Lingxiao Sect's possession, he intended to return to the Tongxuan Continent.

If possible he also planned to seek out Su Yan and Shan Qingluo.

Many people were waiting for him; he couldn't remain forever on Dark Star.

But before departing he had to gather cultivation supplies; this voyage might last more than a year, and because Lingxiao Sect didn't communicate much with the outside, resources were not self-sufficient — he wanted to leave ample provisions for the sect's disciples.

Saint Crystals were no worry: the second layer of Flowing Flame Sandland held a rich vein of Saint Crystals sufficient for a thousand years. Pills, however, were comparatively scarce.

Although a pill master, Yang Kai couldn't refine a vast number of Spiritual Pills at once and needed to purchase and store what he could.

For this reason Yang Kai did not use the space array on this trip; he visited towns along the way to buy Spiritual Pills and other rare medicines in bulk.

He was headed for Yingyue Hall!

Before setting off he wanted to invite Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, who long ago had hinted at wanting a ride; at the time Yang Kai hadn't decided, so he never replied.

Even Qiantian Sect had been granted a slot; Yang Kai wouldn't omit Yingyue Hall — Qian Tong had taken good care of him on Dark Star, and Fei Zhi Tu was an old acquaintance.

Leaving without notice would be unreasonable.

Meanwhile, to the east of Dark Star across a vast plain rose a towering metropolis stretching for a thousand miles, its center packed with numerous exquisite palaces.

This was the Battle Sky Alliance's headquarters, Battle Sky City.

In one palace two men were discussing serious matters: one an old man with white hair and a youthful face, the other a burly middle-aged man.

If Yang Kai were present he'd recognize the elder as Mo Xiaosheng, the Battle Sky Alliance's Great Elder, who, like him, cultivated space arts.

At this moment that venerable Great Elder treated the middle-aged man with respectful courtesy.

The man's identity was clear — it was Qu Zheng, the Alliance Master of the Battle Sky Alliance!
