## Chapter 2444 — Neither Man Nor Woman

With the strength this person was displaying, Chang Hao and Chang Xian weren’t even worthy to carry his shoes.

How could someone at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm be so powerful? Facing this man impersonating Feng De, Yu Ying felt a terror and helplessness as if she were facing an Emperor Realm master. She didn’t even have the courage to run, only standing there dumbly, her delicate body trembling like a quail in winter without a nest.

After killing Zhong Zhenyong, Yang Kai reached out and summoned his Spatial Ring and the Netherworld Infernal Banner. A beam of starlight shot up from the back of Zhong Zhenyong’s hand, then streaked toward Yang Kai, branding itself onto the back of his own hand.

Yang Kai had already noticed that Zhong Zhenyong’s Star Seal was the same as his own—a Six-Pointed Star Seal. After the two merged, his own Star Seal would be greatly nourished, bringing him one step closer to an upgrade.

Only then did he turn his gaze, coldly looking at Yu Ying.

“Senior Brother Feng... I... I...” Yu Ying met his eyes, her face instantly turning pale. She stammered, unable to even finish a sentence.

“You’ve had a hard journey,” Yang Kai said calmly.

Yu Ying forced a weak smile and, trembling, replied, “To serve Senior Brother Feng is this Little Sister’s honor.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, then suddenly raised a hand. As the Power of Space surged, a pitch-black Moon Blade slashed toward her.

“No!” Seeing this, Yu Ying’s face instantly lost all color and she screamed loudly.

She didn’t know what kind of secret technique this was, but she had just witnessed Zhong Zhenyong die to such a pitch-black slash. Now that Yang Kai was using it on her, it was clear he had no intention of letting her live.

In her panic, she hurriedly summoned a Secret Treasure for defense and activated her Origin Qi, hoping to escape this calamity.

But to her utter horror, this pitch-black slash was so overwhelmingly strong that she couldn’t even fathom it. It tore through all her defenses like cutting tofu, passing right through her body.

Yu Ying only felt a slight pain, and in the next moment, she lost all consciousness.

Yang Kai reached out and took her Spatial Ring, then waited a moment. Soon, Yu Ying’s Star Seal shot out and was absorbed by him.

He raised his hand again, sending out several blasts of energy that reduced the corpses of Zhong Zhenyong and Yu Ying to dust.

He didn't hesitate to kill Yu Ying. Regardless of whether he was truly Feng De or not, he had once saved this woman’s life. Yet not only did she show no gratitude, but after learning of his dubious origins, she immediately turned on him. Such a person truly deserved to die.

Besides, Yang Kai had never had a good impression of her to begin with.

Afterward, Yang Kai frowned and glanced behind him.

He sensed that people from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land were approaching. He didn’t know if they had come for the Fire Elemental Origin here or were tracking him and his group.

However, Yang Kai had no intention of meeting the people from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. Those few were enemies of Yu Ying, and now that she was dead, there was no need for him to get entangled with Chang Hao and Chang Xian.

With a flicker, he sped toward the dark red star.

The closer he got, the more Yang Kai could feel the wild heat radiating from this star. The Fire Elemental Origin hidden here seemed to be something extraordinary, making him secretly look forward to it.

Half an hour later, he landed at a certain spot on the star. Looking around, he saw nothing but desolation. It seemed this star had once been scorched by a great fire, leaving it barren and littered with debris.

He wondered how, among the battlefields of the Great Emperors, this star had managed to remain intact.

“Eh? Firecloud Ganoderma!” Yang Kai’s gaze was suddenly drawn to something that looked like a cloud of fire. With his eyesight, he immediately recognized it as an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herb—Firecloud Ganoderma. What surprised him was that such a Spiritual Herb could grow in a place like this, and it was even Imperial-Grade.

But thinking about it, with such dense fire attribute energy and the presence of a Fire Elemental Origin, it wasn’t strange for fire attribute Spiritual Herbs to be born here.

Just as he hesitated, Yang Kai suddenly saw a figure rushing toward the Firecloud Ganoderma, clearly having also noticed its value and wanting to pick it.

Firecloud Ganoderma was an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herb, already priceless on its own. Its extremely harsh growth conditions made it even more valuable than most Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herbs.

As an Imperial-Grade Alchemist, how could Yang Kai allow the Spiritual Herb before his eyes to be snatched away?

So with a flicker, he arrived at the Firecloud Ganoderma a step ahead.

He reached down and dug out a large chunk of soil along with the Firecloud Ganoderma, tossing it all into the Small Xuan Realm.

Only after Yang Kai finished did the figure finally rush up to him.

Realizing they were a step too late, the person stopped ten zhang in front of Yang Kai, looking at him with clear displeasure.

Yang Kai glanced at the newcomer indifferently. When he got a good look at their face, he couldn’t help but frown.

Because at a glance, he couldn’t tell if the other person was male or female.

If he said they were a man, they were far too pretty, with skin so pale it was almost unnatural, and no Adam’s apple. But if he said they were a woman, he couldn’t see any of the features a woman should have—flat chest, no curves, and though the figure was slender, there was no shape to speak of.

Their clothing was also extremely androgynous, the kind that could be worn by either men or women.

This person was neither man nor woman—what the hell? Yang Kai looked at them with a strange expression.

As Yang Kai was sizing them up, the newcomer suddenly said, “Friend, isn’t this a bit unfair? I was the one who discovered this Spiritual Herb first.”

As soon as they spoke, Yang Kai was stunned.

He had thought that if he couldn’t tell their gender by appearance, he could at least judge by their voice. But after hearing them speak, he realized he was too naive.

Their voice had a magnetic quality, very pleasant but also very neutral—there was no way to tell if they were a man or a woman! The other party was also at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the same as Yang Kai, but the Star Seal on the back of their hand was only a Five-Pointed Star Seal.

Yang Kai didn’t bother arguing about their gender. He just grinned and said, “Brother, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want. Ownerless things belong to whoever gets them first.”

At these words, the person frowned, looking extremely angry, and cursed, “You’re the brother! Your whole family are brothers! I’m a woman, can’t you see?”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded. He carefully examined this self-proclaimed woman for a long while before shaking his head seriously. “I really can’t tell.”

The woman seemed furious, her face turning red as she touched her neck. “Are you blind? I don’t have an Adam’s apple, can’t you see?”

Yang Kai replied with a dark expression, “That I do see, but I don’t see... anything else.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai glanced at her chest.

The woman’s face instantly darkened. She couldn’t help but puff out her chest, causing a slight bulge to appear.

Yang Kai clapped his hands. “Now that’s a bit more convincing.”

“You really are blind as a dog!” the woman snapped, gritting her teeth.

Yang Kai wiped the sweat from his forehead. “Miss, how old are you? Children should speak politely and not curse.”

“You’re the child! You’ll always be a child!” the woman shouted angrily. She raised her hand, and a beam of light shot straight at Yang Kai.

The move wasn’t very powerful, and the woman showed no killing intent. Clearly, she was just venting her anger at Yang Kai’s teasing.

After attacking, she didn’t even wait for Yang Kai’s reaction, turning and running off without looking back.

Yang Kai cheerfully waved his hand, dispersing her attack. Looking up, he saw the woman glaring at him from several hundred zhang away before leaping away and disappearing from sight.

“Don’t go, miss! I haven’t asked your name yet!” Yang Kai called out with a grin.

But there was no response. The woman had already run off somewhere, probably so infuriated by Yang Kai that she couldn’t be bothered to deal with him or argue over the Firecloud Ganoderma.

After being messed with by this neither-man-nor-woman, Yang Kai suddenly felt much more cheerful.

He released his Divine Sense, scanning the surroundings. Confirming there were no other Spiritual Herbs, he summoned his wooden boat and flew toward the area where the Origin Power was densest.

He could now be certain that Yin Lesheng was somewhere on this star, though he couldn’t pinpoint the exact location.

Still, heading toward the densest Origin Power was definitely the right move, because Yin Lesheng would surely go there. As long as he found Yin Lesheng, he could inquire about Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts.

Ever since arriving in the Star Realm, Yang Kai had been separated from Xiaoxiao. All these years, he’d never stopped worrying. Xiaoxiao’s uniqueness made it easy for experts to target him.

This star was extremely peculiar. In all his time in the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai had never encountered a star with Spiritual Herbs, but this place had them—and quite a few at that.

All the Spiritual Herbs here were fire attribute, likely nurtured by the Origin Power. Each one was well-aged and valuable. As Yang Kai traveled, he picked quite a few useful things.

It seemed there were quite a few cultivators who had come to this Cultivation Star. Yang Kai occasionally encountered some, but they rarely acted alone like him. Most moved in pairs or small groups, clearly disciples of the same Sect or people who already knew each other.

These people all looked fierce and tough, their auras strong—clearly not to be trifled with.

One day later, he suddenly sensed a massive surge of energy from a distant location.

In mid-flight, he immediately stopped, his gaze sharp as he looked in that direction. He felt a wave of Imperial Might spreading from there, startling him. Could it be that someone was breaking through to the Emperor Realm here?
