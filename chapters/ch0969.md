## Chapter 969 — Meeting the Onslaught

Above the Water Divine Hall, Yang Kai, standing on the Star Shuttle, froze in place as if shackled; he couldn't move, pain flickering across his face.

Those who saw this went pale. The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox slapped its thigh and hollered, "He's hit — that brat's trapped! Go save him!"

"Too late!" Demon General Meng Ge's face darkened as he stared at the Bone Clan expert rapidly closing in on Yang Kai.

Earlier, Yang Kai had used the Secret Treasure's might to escape pursuit, but now he stood rooted to the spot. The Bone Clan expert who had been ordered to seize him had already arrived beside Yang Kai with a feral grin, thrusting out a huge hand to clamp down on Yang Kai's throat with brutal speed and force.

No one doubted for a moment that he could snap Yang Kai's neck with a single wrench.

Many could not bear to watch that cruel scene and hurriedly turned their heads away, their hearts filled with a sorrowful sense that Yang Kai might perish before ever achieving success.  

At that instant a faint heat radiated through the air, and with a dull boom the sky above the Water Divine Hall flared crimson. Countless strange flames sprang up, fragile as if they might extinguish at any moment, yet within each flicker lay terrifying power. They shot downward like meteors, setting the island ablaze in an instant and turning the ground to scorched earth.

The Bone Clan's many members' jade-green eyes betrayed fear and dread as they hurled themselves into the high air to avoid the searing power.

They feared fire above all else; that heat could annihilate them utterly.

At the same time, the supposedly immobilized Yang Kai suddenly and mysteriously regained his freedom, as if he'd never been restrained. He grinned at the Bone Clan expert who had lunged at him, then, shifting his stance, returned to his own ranks.

"You little bastard, you wanted to scare me to death!" Meng Wuya breathed, still trembling from the fright; although he had complete confidence in Yang Kai, that moment had been far too perilous.

"You ran over there just to give us a thrill and scare them?" Changyuan shot Yang Kai a glance, his expression tinged with displeasure.

"Not at all." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Wait and see."

"Wait for what?" Changyuan frowned, not understanding the trick he was playing.

No one understood, not even the Bone Clan leader Ke Luo.

Though they had slept for thousands of years, they had once battled the continent's living beings. Ke Luo had never seen such an odd young man.

The other's Divine Sense power was in no way inferior to his own—otherwise he could never have escaped unscathed.

What baffled Ke Luo most was what the youth intended to do. Had he flown over just to flaunt his unusual Divine Sense cultivation?

Ten breaths later, a piercing scream suddenly rose from the Bone Clan ranks. With that cry a chain reaction seemed to spread across them; countless agonized shrieks answered one another, rising in an unbroken tide.

They writhed as if undergoing unbearable torment. Their jade-green pupils trembled and their bodies convulsed. Uncontrolled, they plummeted from the sky like rain, falling onto the island and into the sea, sending up sprays of water.

In an instant three thousand Bone Clan members lost five or six hundred of their number.

"What's happening!" Ke Luo's face changed and he roared.

"My Lord, we don't know!" a Bone Clan member answered in panic.

The human, yao, and demon experts watched in confusion, equally at a loss to comprehend the scene.

But they quickly noticed that those screaming and falling into the sea and onto the island were all Transcendent Realm cultivators, and specifically the weaker Transcendent Realm fighters.

"It's a Divine Sense attack!" one Bone Clan expert at the First Stage of the Saint Realm said, face ashen, enduring immense pain in his Sea of Consciousness as he reported through gritted teeth, "His Divine Sense attack is laced with unknown worms that are devouring our people's spirit energy. The worms are tiny and subtle; they're hard to detect—I've been hit too!"

"Soul Devouring Worm?" Ke Luo's expression shifted violently as he thought of that ancient creature that sent every living being quailing. "How could such a thing exist on this continent?"

What perplexed him more was how that youth could command the Soul Devouring Worms and weave them into a Divine Sense attack.

Ten li away, the human, yao, and demon experts stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, each eye lighting with a strong thrill.

They'd heard of the Soul Devouring Worms—ancient pests that devour spirit energy. Once infected, those without sufficient strength faced certain death.

Yet the worms Yang Kai produced seemed more potent than the rumors suggested, because the lore said that upon reaching the Saint Realm, one could use powerful Divine Sense to annihilate such worms.

But among the Bone Clan, there were clearly Saint Realm practitioners who had been affected; they hadn't fallen but looked battered and were clearly impaired by the worms, temporarily unfit for combat.

"You really created those Soul Devouring Worms?" Meng Wuya asked uncertainly.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded. "I raised them with my own Divine Sense."

Meng Wuya's expression shifted between admiration and disbelief at Yang Kai's audacity and the strangeness of it.

"No wonder you said you'd handle the Transcendent-level Bone Clan members—so that's how." the Great Lord Lei Long suddenly understood. The Soul Devouring Worms were a terrifying force—capable of easily wiping out a species.

At the thought, cold sweat prickled down the backs of Lei Long, Changyuan, and the others; a breeze brushed them and it felt chilling.

They privately rejoiced that they'd cultivated good relations with Yang Kai instead of making him an enemy—if he turned against them, those Soul Devouring Worms alone could eradicate the yao and demon races.

The Saint Realm needn't fear them, but how many Saint Realm fighters did those two races possess? Most of their kin were below the Saint Realm; once infected by the ancient worms, death was inevitable.

Many human experts noticed this too, their gazes toward Yang Kai changing as if reassessing him. Some silently considered whether they should make more amicable ties with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land afterward.

"That opening strike was masterful," Chu Lingxiao laughed heartily. "Solved hundreds of Bone Clan in one blow—seems they're doomed to extinction."

“If they’re smart enough, they won’t just sit and wait for death!” Yang Kai frowned as he looked over, his mind racing. Although his sudden charge had caught the Bone Clan off guard, if it truly devolved into a chaotic battle, the Soul Devouring Worms would no longer be able to exert such overwhelming effect.

Those tiny worms only follow compulsion to devour spirit energy; scattering amid a melee would likely cause them to harm their allies.

Yang Kai now wished the Bone Clan would remain immobile; given enough time, the Soul Devouring Worms could kill all their members below the Saint Realm.

Then the Bone Clan would be left with fewer than a hundred Saint Realm members—an easy feast for the combined forces of humans, yao, and demons.

In less than thirty breaths, the five or six hundred Bone Clan who had fallen into the sea and onto the ground were already dead. Their jade-green eyes lost their luster, dim and motionless.

Even a strange race like the Bone Clan dies when its spirit is devoured.

With so many suddenly dead, Ke Luo's jade-green eyes reddened. In rage he raised his head and let out a howl; a dense blood-mist exploded from his body and swept across the isles.

That blood-mist carried not only his physical power but also a fierce Divine Sense attack.

In an instant Yang Kai felt that many of the Soul Devouring Worms he'd raised had perished; his face changed and he hurriedly recalled the remaining worms.

The two thousand or so surviving Bone Clan glared at them with deep hatred.

A massive suction force radiated from them, spreading in all directions.

The flesh of those recently dead Bone Clan visibly withered, their blood and flesh transforming into surges of energy that flowed into the living, strengthening them.

In a short while the five or six hundred dead Bone Clan were nothing but a pile of dust, completely gone.

Yang Kai was shaken. "They can do that?"

The human, yao, and demon experts also paled.

If that's the case, the more that died the more they benefited. Whether kin or enemy, they could absorb the flesh essence and grow stronger.

Yang Kai suddenly realized this and felt a chill in his heart.

He understood at once that this would be a truly brutal fight.

"They're coming!" Meng Wuya barked.

“Prepare to fight!” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and shouted loudly, “Remember—ordinary wounds mean nothing to them. Even a stab to a vital spot won’t affect them. The best way to kill them is to tear them apart, crush them to pieces, or burn them to ash!”

Yang Kai had already warned everyone of these details before they engaged; at the last moment he couldn't help but remind them again.

"Understood — I'll show them the Great Lord's methods," Changyuan sneered.

From the island, two or three thousand Bone Clan sped over in silence, each one cruel-faced and seemingly unafraid of death.

The human, yao, and demon forces held their ground, yet the power of thousands swelled within them, ready to erupt.

The ten-li distance closed quickly.

When the Bone Clan plunged to half a li away, many experts finally moved. Pure Saint Yuan, Demon Yuan, and Yao Yuan burst forth in waves while myriad Secret Treasures were unleashed, their varied glows dazzling the sky.

The sudden eruption of light swept across heaven and earth, making the world hum and quake as if on the verge of being torn apart.

The Secret Treasures were of all shapes and sorts, a magnificent array beyond count.

The two thousand-plus Bone Clan members bared their teeth and howled; an invisible force drew up the surrounding seawater into towering waves like sea-dragons, fused with their crimson blood-energy, and met the first assault of the humans, yao, and demons.
