## Chapter 583 — Winning Over Allies

After drinking some bland tea for a while, several members from the Eight Great Families gradually lost their patience. After all, they were the helm of Zhongdu’s most powerful clans; their status, identity, and cultivation far beyond ordinary people. Usually they stood high above others, but now, arriving at Yang Kai’s mansion, they felt restrained and uneasy, naturally brewing resentment in their hearts.

Especially since Yang Kai still wore a leisurely expression, looking as if he had them all figured out. Sitting upright at the head seat, his face stern and silent, he seemed to be waiting for them to speak first.

Suddenly, Gao Mo stood up, shouting fiercely, “Nephew, the heads of the Eight Great Families have come to discuss important matters with you, yet you let this demoness meddle. What is the meaning of this?”

“Demoness?” A cold glint flashed in Shan Qingluo’s beautiful eyes, and she then chuckled lightly, “Head of the Gao Family, that word is too serious a burden for me.”

“Hmph, demoness is demoness. If not for your nephew’s face, we would have taken your life outright today. If you don’t cherish this grace, then leave quickly. Do you want to force us to attack you right here?”

Gao Rangfeng was cruelly killed by the Poison King and Ghost King, so Gao Mo and these Evil Kings from the Cangyun Evil Land held unyielding enmity.

“No one is allowed to lay a hand in my mansion!” Yang Kai snorted coldly and snapped his fingers.

In the next instant, the heads of the Eight Great Families’ expressions suddenly changed as they simultaneously felt a strange energy envelop them, suppressing the flow of their True Yuan so they could not gather their cultivation.

Their faces froze in horror as they stared at Yang Kai.

They had no idea what method Yang Kai had used to bind even those above the Divine Roaming Realm. Such a technique was utterly astonishing.

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent. After briefly warning them, he motioned to Meng Wuya to release their restraint.

Within the Heavenly Journey Palace, Meng Wuya was the absolute master. Even if a Transcendent Realm expert barged in, their life and death would still be within his grasp. It was precisely for this reason that, when he tried to seize the Heaven-Dominating Force King, he was blocked by the Lightning Shadow King, allowing that man to escape.

Gao Mo glared fiercely at Yang Kai in anger but knew better than to act rashly now, scowling, “Nephew, you are the direct bloodline of the Yang Family. Are you really siding this time with the Cangyun Evil Land?”

The other seven family heads all looked grave, their gaze intensely fixed on Yang Kai.

“Colluding with demons, cultivating evil arts, plotting to bring chaos to Zhongdu…” Yang Kai’s tone was calm as he listed each charge in turn. “All of these are but one-sided claims from your Eight Great Families. And now you say I’m in league with the Cangyun Evil Land — that too is only your one-sided story. Uncles, shall I offer my rebuttal?”

The eight family heads looked embarrassed, feeling ashamed.

Back then, the Eight Great Families had deliberately slandered Yang Kai, and he was powerless to respond. But now? He had attained the strength to stand on equal footing with them.

The power he had amassed could easily sweep away any one of the Eight Great Families.

Yang Kai’s cold questioning sent chills through them all.

“But one thing you all said is not wrong—I have indeed colluded with demons.”

Their faces instantly pale as they stared at him in horror.

Yang Kai pointed at the Enchantress Queen and smiled faintly. “Shan Qingluo and I are old acquaintances. Back when I was stranded in the Cangyun Evil Land, she looked after me many times. Kindness shown to me, I will repay; enmity toward me, I will avenge. So if anyone dares to harm her, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

The Queen’s face lit up with happiness, a pride rising in her heart.

This was the man she had chosen—strong and domineering, suppressing the family heads of the Eight Great Families so thoroughly, they dare not resist in the slightest. Shan Qingluo’s eyes grew dreamy.

“At most, this is only a personal friendship between Nephew and this… Enchantress Queen. How could that be counted as colluding with demons? Nephew is someone who keeps public and private matters distinct — we all know this well.” Kang Rui quickly spoke up in Yang Kai’s defense.

Yang Yinghao sighed softly, “Yang Kai, the events six months ago were the fault of my Yang Family and the Zhongdu Eight Great Families against you. Now those are past. After overcoming this crisis, the Eight Great Families will make amends and fulfill all your wishes.”

“Uncle,” Yang Kai pondered for a moment, a serious look on his face. “Let’s not mention those things from six months ago. I’m not that concerned. If I want something, I take it myself. No need for compensation from the Eight Great Families.”

Yang Yinghao nodded lightly. Yang Kai saying this showed he had truly lost faith in the Eight Great Families, yet it also showed he no longer cared about what had happened six months ago.

After all, almost all who had come against him then were dead.

“What business do you uncles have here today?” Yang Kai asked.

The eight exchanged glances before Yang Yinghao cleared his throat, “It is nothing major. Since the Enchantress Queen came to find you, she must have something to discuss. Let her speak first.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, not forcing them, knowing they were wary of Shan Qingluo’s intentions and wanted to observe.

Turning to Shan Qingluo, she smiled, not hiding anything from the Eight Great Families, and said boldly, “Yang Kai, I come on behalf of the Evil Lord as an envoy to persuade you.”

The expressions of Yang Yinghao and others turned cold instantly. Although they had suspected as much, hearing it from Shan Qingluo still unsettled them. All pricked their ears keenly.

“The Evil Lord hopes you will join forces with him to destroy the Eight Great Families and seize control over the world,” she said plainly, as if the eight family heads were beneath her notice.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, his interest piqued. “What’s in it for me?”

“Once done, the entire world will be yours.”

Yang Kai was stunned. “And what does the Evil Lord want?”

“He only wants the Eight Great Families destroyed.” Shan Qingluo frowned as she answered, her tone strange. Clearly, she didn’t believe the Evil Lord would invest such effort leading elite forces to invade Zhongdu for something that brought him no benefit.

“The Evil Lord also said…” A blush rose on Shan Qingluo’s cheeks as she quietly glanced at Yang Kai, “If you agree with him, he will first grant you the Enchantress Queen as a gift.”

“Ha!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, watching her with interest. “Aren’t you already mine? What gift is that? What right does he have?”

“That’s what I think too,” Shan Qingluo smiled lightly and nodded.

The heads of the Eight Great Families exchanged strange looks, surprised by the ambiguous intimacy between Yang Kai and this famous Enchantress Queen.

“Will you agree or not?” Shan Qingluo pressed.

“Yes, why wouldn’t I agree to such a good deal?” Yang Kai nodded seriously.

Yang Yinghao and the others’ faces changed drastically, their vigilance spiking as they stared at Yang Kai. They hadn’t expected him to be so easily swayed by Shan Qingluo.

Just as they were about to question him, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly grew cold. “However, I have one condition.”

“Say it. I’m just the messenger,” she replied.

“Go back and tell the Evil Lord I want his head. My master cares deeply for his head. If he can deliver that, only then will I join him.”

Shan Qingluo nodded coolly. “I will tell him, though I doubt he’ll agree.”

With that said, she stood gracefully and left, taking Biluo with her, as if truly just delivering a message without attempting to persuade Yang Kai.

After she left, the family heads quietly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing Yang Kai would never stand with the Evil Lord.

The Evil Lord came from Lingxiao Pavilion and was Yang Kai’s senior uncle. Ling Taixu, the sect leader of Lingxiao Pavilion, sought to kill the Evil Lord Yang Bai. Because of this relationship, Yang Kai and Yang Bai would always be enemies, never friends.

With this thought, the eight relaxed considerably.

“Uncles, what business do you have with me?” Yang Kai looked back at them.

Yang Yinghao mulled it over then said, “We hope you will return to the Yang Family, for you are still the legitimate bloodline.”

Now, Zhongdu was divided into three powers. Yang Kai’s mansion was like a thorn stabbing between the Eight Great Families and the Cangyun Evil Land, and his ambiguous stance caused the Zhongdu faction to hope he would lean toward them.

In this past month, Yang Kai’s estate had accepted many elite reinforcements aiding Zhongdu, including ten Transcendent Realm experts. If he joined the Eight Great Families, driving out the Cangyun Evil Land wouldn’t be difficult.

“Uncle, I won’t go back,” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Why?”

“Only those with power have a voice. If I return, can I still talk to you like this?” Yang Kai sneered.

Once back in the Yang Family, his power would be fully controlled by the Eight Great Families. What could he possibly do alone?

“My master wants to take Yang Bai’s life, and I must assist him. To restore the sect’s honor, I must also rely on my own strength. Uncles, if I go back, can the Eight Great Families submit to my command? If you can do that, then returning would be no problem.”

“Impossible!” Gao Mo said sternly. “At most you’ll be given some say, but battle plans and arrangements will still be decided by us.”

To Gao Mo, Yang Kai was too young, impulsive, and prone to mistakes. How could Zhongdu’s vast legacy be entrusted to him?

“Then there’s nothing more to say—I prefer to act independently,” Yang Kai said slowly, his expression final.

“Insisting on this?” Yang Yinghao asked.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded firmly.

Yang Yinghao pondered for a long moment before saying, “I must first discuss with the Elder Hall. The Eight Great Families will not entrust you, but I might be able to fight for the Yang Family to be entrusted to you.”

“Brother Yang?” Gao Mo looked at Yang Yinghao in disbelief, seemingly shocked by his words.

What this meant was that the Yang Family leadership might change.

“A man may be wronged for a time, but he cannot be wronged for a lifetime… What do you say, Yang Kai?” Yang Yinghao asked with a meaningful look.

“Uncle is right,” Yang Kai smiled confidently.
