## Chapter 2248 — Upper-Level Earth Vein

Fenglin City, Qin Family.

In Qin Yu’s boudoir, Qin Yu lay on her sickbed, pale and bloodless, occasionally coughing softly. Sometimes, when the coughing grew violent, she could barely catch her breath.

A strange aura of death lingered around Qin Yu. Even ordinary people who had never cultivated could faintly sense that something was wrong with her condition. If someone with cultivation used their Divine Sense to scan her, they would clearly see that Qin Yu was shrouded in a faint black mist.

As time passed, this black mist only grew thicker.

No one knew what kind of energy this black mist was. Ever since it appeared two months ago, it had been devouring Qin Yu’s vitality, causing her condition to worsen day by day.

Heaven and Earth Severed Body—this was a very special constitution, one rejected by the world itself. Anyone with this constitution could not live past eighteen, as the world’s laws would sever their life force.

By the sickbed, the maidservant attending Qin Yu secretly wiped away her tears, her eyes red and swollen from crying.

Qin Yu was kind and gentle, courteous to all, and the Qin Family’s servants all respected her deeply. This maidservant was no exception. Seeing her young lady fall gravely ill and weaken so much in just two months, the maid’s heart ached terribly.

“What are you crying for! Useless thing, get out at once!” Suddenly, Qin Chaoyang shouted angrily from the side.

He too had been deeply troubled these days, his heart in turmoil. Now, seeing the maid crying in front of him, he grew even more irritable and couldn’t help but scold her.

The maid was terrified and dropped to her knees, but she did not leave. She pleaded, "Please forgive me, Patriarch. Please calm your anger, I won’t cry anymore, nor will I leave. I want to stay and take care of the young lady…"

She begged repeatedly, her tone sincere.

Qin Chaoyang opened his mouth, but in the end, he just sighed deeply. With a wave of his hand, an invisible force lifted the maid to her feet. He restrained his anger and said, “Forget it, forget it…”

His tone was indescribably desolate and bleak.

“It’s my fault. I didn’t take good care of the young lady.” The maid said, wiping her eyes again, but holding back her sobs.

“Patriarch…” On the sickbed, Qin Yu suddenly called out softly. As soon as she spoke, she was seized by a violent fit of coughing. The maid hurried forward to gently rub her back.

When Qin Yu finally caught her breath, Qin Chaoyang spoke softly, “Yu’er, just rest. Don’t say anything.”

Qin Yu slowly shook her head and said, “Eldest Brother… has he not returned yet?”

Hearing this, Qin Chaoyang’s expression changed slightly. He didn’t know how to respond.

Now, with Qin Yu’s eighteenth birthday approaching, the only hope for her survival rested with Yang Kai. But there was still no sign of him.

Qin Chaoyang couldn’t help but wonder if he had entrusted the matter to the wrong person.

Qin Chaoyang had already investigated the events in the Four Seasons Land.

In the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai had made a great display, refining the Supreme Mystery Pill and, by himself, manipulating the elite disciples of all the major Sects. This had long since spread, causing a sensation throughout the Southern Territory.

Although Fenglin City was small, with Qin Chaoyang’s deliberate inquiries, how could he not have heard about it?

However… the Four Seasons Land had closed three months ago. If Yang Kai had truly obtained the Calamity Fruit, he should have returned to Fenglin City by now. So why had there been no sign of him?

Qin Chaoyang was unwilling to judge a gentleman with a petty heart, but as long as Yang Kai did not appear, he could not be at ease.

He didn’t know whether Yang Kai was too ashamed to face him for not having found the Calamity Fruit, or whether Yang Kai simply didn’t care and had disappeared.

Now, with the world so vast, even if he wanted to search for Yang Kai, he wouldn’t know where to start. Besides, there was no time left.

“Patriarch, are you doubting Eldest Brother?” Though gravely ill, Qin Yu was as perceptive as ever. Seeing the look on Qin Chaoyang’s face, she guessed his worries at once.

“I don’t want to think too much, just hoping that Brother Yang can bring that item back soon. But… even if he didn’t get it, he should have come back to let me know. People have their limits, and I can understand that. But now… sigh!”

“Maybe Eldest Brother was delayed by something important.” Qin Yu said softly. As soon as she finished, she was wracked by another fit of coughing.

“Let’s hope so.” Qin Chaoyang forced a bitter smile, though he was not convinced in his heart.

Even if something important had delayed him, he could have sent word back, right? Deep down, Qin Chaoyang was increasingly convinced that Yang Kai had probably taken the Qin Family’s Myriad Sword and had no intention of returning.

If the Imperial Treasure Myriad Sword was lost, then so be it. Though precious, the Qin Family had declined, and no one could wield its power. A commoner with a treasure is bound to invite trouble—perhaps it would only bring disaster.

But the pain of having misjudged someone made Qin Chaoyang’s heart ache, and he secretly regretted entrusting such an important matter to someone he had only just met.

If he had gone to the Four Seasons Land himself, perhaps there would have been a sliver of hope, and Qin Yu would not be lying here waiting for death.

A deep sense of guilt gnawed at Qin Chaoyang’s heart, leaving him sleepless and restless, unable to find peace day or night.

“Eldest Brother will come back,” Qin Yu said firmly. “He’s not the kind of person who would take advantage and leave without a word.”

“Miss, at a time like this, you’re still speaking up for him.” The maid looked on with heartache, her tears threatening to fall again.

“What do you know?” Qin Yu scolded her, then continued, “Although I haven’t spent much time with Eldest Brother, Patriarch, you should know I possess the Fortune Heavenly Eye. I’m very accurate at judging people.”

Hearing this, Qin Chaoyang’s eyes lit up, and his despair was replaced by a glimmer of hope.

Indeed, although Qin Yu’s cultivation was not high, because she possessed the Fortune Heavenly Eye, she was very good at judging people. Usually, with just one look, she could tell a person’s character and whether they were trustworthy.

If Qin Yu hadn’t agreed back then, Qin Chaoyang would never have dared to give Yang Kai the spot to enter the Four Seasons Land.

“So Eldest Brother must have been delayed by something…” Qin Yu concluded. Then she said, “Patriarch, you go about your business. Don’t worry about me, I’ll get better sooner or later. But as for Fenglin City… I heard from Hui’er that many important people have come recently, and even our Qin Family is hosting one?”

“Yes!” Qin Chaoyang nodded. “You’ve been gravely ill, so I didn’t tell you. This little girl has been gossiping behind my back.”

As he spoke, he glared at the maid called Hui’er.

The maid quickly stuck out her tongue and explained, “I just wanted to cheer up the young lady, so I mentioned a few things. I won’t do it again.”

“If you do it again, I’ll break your legs!” Qin Chaoyang snorted coldly.

“Don’t be afraid, Patriarch is just scaring you.” Qin Yu smiled, patting Hui’er’s hand.

Qin Chaoyang sighed deeply. “The servants at home have all been spoiled by you.”

“Patriarch, what’s happened in the city lately to attract so many people?” Qin Yu turned to ask.

In the past two years, Fenglin City had been anything but peaceful. First, a Divine Spirit appeared, drawing even the overlord Star God Palace to send experts to investigate. Then, Demonic Qi besieged the city, causing a huge commotion. The nearby Musen City nearly faced destruction, but at the last moment, the Demonic Qi retreated on its own, and the demonized people regained their senses.

Otherwise, Musen City would now be a ghost town.

That time, several Emperor Realm masters even came personally to investigate.

Now, for some unknown reason, many experts had arrived again. Qin Yu had heard some rumors from Hui’er, but didn’t know the details, so she wanted to ask clearly.

“If you trace it back, this matter is still related to the last appearance of the Demonic Qi.” Qin Chaoyang sighed, his face full of worry.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s face changed, and she exclaimed, “Could it be that the vanished Demonic Qi has appeared again?”

Hui’er, standing nearby, also trembled, her face full of fear.

“That’s not it,” Qin Chaoyang replied. “After the Demonic Qi mysteriously retreated last time, it never appeared again. But… when we went to the place beneath the seal, we found an Upper-Level Earth Vein!”

“An Upper-Level Earth Vein?” Qin Yu’s beautiful eyes lit up. “There’s an Upper-Level Earth Vein near Fenglin City?”

Qin Chaoyang smiled as well. “It surprised all of us old fellows. You know, the reason no great force ever settled in Fenglin City was because it’s small, the Spiritual Qi is thin, and there are no special resources. So for years, the City Lord’s Mansion has governed the area. But now that an Upper-Level Earth Vein has appeared, things are different…”

“Just a single Upper-Level Earth Vein isn’t enough to attract so many great forces, is it? Is there another reason?”

“Exactly!” Qin Chaoyang’s expression grew serious. “Near that Upper-Level Earth Vein, they also found many branches of Middle-Level and Lower-Level Earth Veins. And toward Yuqing Mountain, there seems to be a Source Crystal lode, though we don’t know its grade yet!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be moved.

Now she finally understood why Fenglin City had attracted so many people.

Just the Source Crystal lode alone was enough to make people fight to the death, not to mention the many Earth Veins of various grades.

“The Star God Palace and the very top forces may not care about these Earth Veins and Source Crystal lodes, but the second- and third-tier forces can’t ignore them. Fenglin City is now in turmoil. Dozens of Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators have arrived, and as for Emperor Realm masters, I’m not sure, but if the benefits are great enough, it’s only a matter of time before they come.”

After hearing this, Qin Yu said seriously, “Patriarch, at such a critical time, our Qin Family must not get involved. Just watch and wait. In front of those giants, our Qin Family is but a pebble, unable to contend with them.”
