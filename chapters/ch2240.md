## Chapter 2240 — Little Fatty

That was one thing, but the key was that within this Divine Roaming Mirror, there were quite a few experts—Yi Quan, Bai Lu, Yuan Fei, Zhou Dian, Yuan Qing, Lian Yan... and even the Great Emperor-level Tian Yan standing before him.

If, in the future, he could refine a Life Origin Pill, Yang Kai could summon a force capable of sweeping across the Star Realm at any time!

Just thinking about it made Yang Kai's blood boil!

Tian Yan smiled, his expression full of meaning.

Seeing his expression, Yang Kai immediately understood that his earlier conversation with Granny You had likely been overheard by this expert, so he knew about the Warm Spirit Lotus and also what Yang Kai wanted to accomplish by communicating with the will of this world.

He couldn't help but feel quite embarrassed.

After a while, Tian Yan finally said, "It's not that this old man is unwilling to help you, but... your cultivation is too low. Unless the will of this world takes the initiative to contact you, you won't be able to sense it no matter what. Even with my help, it won't work."

“Imperial Might… the power to command the Laws?” Yang Kai murmured, lost in thought.

Although Dao Origin Realm cultivators had already comprehended Law Power, they could only mobilize and borrow it. But those in the Emperor Realm could truly master it—they themselves were the laws. The might of heaven and earth was the greatest law of this world, and to communicate with it, one naturally needed the corresponding cultivation.

"That's right," Tian Yan nodded.

"Then... what a pity," Yang Kai sighed repeatedly.

Tian Yan said, "Since you possess the seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus, it's not as if you have no chance. However... you must further improve your own strength. If you can truly do as that woman said—subdue the Mirror Soul and refine this world—perhaps it would be a good thing for the living beings here. This old man will be watching."

Yang Kai raised his brows and cupped his fists, "This Junior will do his utmost!"

Tian Yan praised, "That day will come. For now, the most urgent matter is to deal with these Soul-Devouring Worms."

"But, Senior..." Yang Kai looked troubled. "If you can't seal these Soul-Devouring Worms, I don't dare take them with me."

Tian Yan laughed, "Of course, I can't do it alone. But if I can borrow the power of heaven and earth and recreate what happened back then, it won't be a problem."

Yang Kai's eyes lit up and he said eagerly, "Then there's no time to lose. I'll trouble Senior."

Tian Yan nodded slightly, then suddenly sat down cross-legged, motionless.

Yang Kai stood quietly in place, waiting. He knew the other was about to communicate with the will of this world and contact the Mirror Soul of the Divine Roaming Mirror.

Tian Yan was a Great Emperor-level existence, so he should have a good chance of succeeding.

In an instant, a vast, ocean-like Divine Sense spread out, bursting in all directions, vanishing into the void and shifting unpredictably.

In the face of this pure and powerful Divine Sense, Yang Kai felt as small as an ant, his heart trembling, his face full of longing.

This scene lasted for a full two hours.

Just as Yang Kai was feeling anxious, Tian Yan suddenly opened his eyes, a brilliant light shooting from them. He called out in a low voice, "Young friend Yang, are you ready?"

At these words, Yang Kai's spirit shook. Realizing Tian Yan had succeeded in borrowing the power of heaven and earth, he quickly nodded, "This junior is ready."

Tian Yan said, "You have the Warm Spirit Lotus, so I will use it as the vessel and cage to seal the Soul-Devouring Worms within. But remember, although I am borrowing the might of heaven and earth and supporting it with my own Divine Sense, once you leave this world, the seal will not last long. Before that time comes, you must deal with the Soul-Devouring Worms, or the consequences will be unimaginable!"

"I understand!" Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

The reason the seal at the altar could last for tens of thousands of years was because it was always within the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, influenced by the will of the Mirror Soul and nourished by the might of heaven and earth.

But if Yang Kai left here, the sealing power he took with him would be like a tree without roots, water without a source—there was no way it could last long.

He had to completely subdue or banish the Soul-Devouring Worms before the seal was broken!

Yang Kai resolved that if there was truly no other way, he would banish the Soul-Devouring Worms into the void. After all, with his space abilities, he could tear space at any time.

"Open your mind and spirit!" Tian Yan shouted again.

Yang Kai immediately sat upright, holding his breath and focusing his mind.

In the next instant, he saw the pitch-black altar suddenly melt before his eyes. At the same time, a rapid buzzing sounded, and countless Soul-Devouring Worms flew out from the altar.

Looking closely, these Soul-Devouring Worms seemed even more violent and unruly than the ones he possessed, their auras incomparably fierce.

After all, these Soul-Devouring Worms had once been extremely powerful, only becoming weak after being sealed for tens of thousands of years. Even so, they were still stronger than the ones Yang Kai owned.

For some reason, as soon as they escaped, they all flew toward Yang Kai, as if something about him attracted them.

Seeing this, Yang Kai naturally felt his scalp tingle.

Now that he was a Spirit Body, this group of Soul-Devouring Worms was not the same as the ones he always controlled. If they surrounded him, it wouldn't take long before he was devoured completely.

Even his Divine Sense Fire might not be able to restrain them.

But even though he was nervous, he didn't dodge.

At the critical moment, Tian Yan made his move.

A pure, dense, and powerful Great Emperor-level Divine Sense surged forth. At the same time, a rainbow bridge suddenly appeared between heaven and earth, one end connected to some distant, unknown place, the other to Tian Yan himself.

This rainbow bridge radiated an aura of supreme might, as if it could control the world itself.

As soon as the rainbow bridge appeared, the Soul-Devouring Worms suddenly quieted, seeming extremely wary.

Tian Yan didn't pause at all. His hands formed seals, merging his own power into the rainbow bridge, transforming it into a sphere of light that slowly enveloped the Soul-Devouring Worms.

In less than ten breaths, only the sphere of light remained before Yang Kai.

After finishing, the light on Tian Yan's body dimmed slightly, as if communicating with the might of heaven and earth had been extremely taxing for him.

But he remained unmoved, his face solemn, reaching out and pointing at Yang Kai.

The sphere of light flew toward Yang Kai in response.

Yang Kai didn't dodge. Instead, he opened his mind and spirit to accept it.

Soon, the sphere of light merged into Yang Kai's Spirit Body. Guided by him, it entered the Warm Spirit Lotus and settled there.

Gazing within himself, Yang Kai quickly found the sphere of light sealing countless Soul-Devouring Worms at the heart of the Warm Spirit Lotus.

Even sealed, Yang Kai could still sense the immense threat within. He knew better than anyone that if the sphere broke, the Soul-Devouring Worms would swarm out and devour him from the inside out.

By then, no one could save him.

"I'll teach you a set of techniques. Practice and master them to reinforce the seal!" Tian Yan's voice came.

Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

In the next moment, Tian Yan taught Yang Kai a sealing technique in great detail.

Yang Kai learned quickly. In just an hour, he had fully grasped it, earning Tian Yan's praise.

After reinforcing the seal, Yang Kai suddenly wore a strange expression and looked in a certain direction.

In that direction, countless li away from Mist Valley, there was a small city—not large, not crowded.

Just then, in that city a little boy of seven or eight, with golden features and chubby cheeks, suddenly turned his head toward Mist Valley.

After a moment, the boy's face turned ugly, and he muttered, "What a loss, what a loss... That old bastard Tian Yan really dragged me into this. I shouldn't have answered him. Now I'm really at a loss."

He mumbled to himself for a while, but no one paid him any mind.

At that moment, a little girl with twin ponytails suddenly walked up to him, hands on her hips, and shouted fiercely, "Little fatty, what are you doing? Hurry up and come out of the city with me! If we're any later, we won't be able to leave!"

The little girl was also about seven or eight, lively and clever, her brows raised, speaking in an old-fashioned tone.

"You actually called me... little fatty!" The boy was instantly furious, clenching his chubby fist in protest. "You girl, do you know who I am..."

Bang!

Before he could finish, the little girl jumped up and punched him on the head, making him shrink his neck and his eyes turn red.

"You'd better watch it!" he shouted.

In response, a pair of furious, dragon-like fists came flying at him...

Soon, the little girl strode proudly toward the city gate, dragging the little fatty behind her. The little fatty's face was full of grief and resentment, his eyes swollen from the beating...

Back in Mist Valley, Tian Yan looked at Yang Kai with a smile and said, "Young friend Yang, did you sense something?"

Only then did Yang Kai come back to his senses. He looked at Tian Yan in surprise and asked, "Senior, did you already know this would happen?"

Tian Yan smiled, "With a treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus and a seal imbued with a trace of this world's power, it's only natural that you could sense that one's location!"

Hearing this, Yang Kai quickly cupped his fists, "Thank you, Senior!"

Tian Yan waved his hand, "This is all I can do for you. If you truly wish to become the master of this world, you'll have to rely on yourself. That one... is not easy to deal with."

"I understand. If I get the chance, I'll give it a try."

"This old man also hopes that day will come. Perhaps then, I too will be able to break free from the shackles of these laws and take a look at the world beyond," Tian Yan said, his eyes filled with longing.

His thoughts were much the same as Yi Quan's—they both wanted to see the world outside with their own eyes.

Only, their motivations were different. Yi Quan sought a higher level of Martial Dao, while Tian Yan was simply curious.
