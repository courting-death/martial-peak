## Chapter 484 — We Will Stop at Just the Mark

The Duanmu Family had originally been allies of Third Brother Yang Tie of the Yang Family, but on the first night of the succession war, Yang Tie was eliminated. That battle left the Duanmu Family decimated, with countless dead and wounded, leaving only five masters.

The instigators were martial artists from Yang Kang’s residence. Naturally, when old enemies met, their resentment flared intensely, itching to retaliate and avenge their fallen clan members as soon as possible.

“Not yet,” Qiu Yimeng said calmly, slowly shaking her head. “Wait until the situation opens up before acting.”

Though Yang Kang’s martial artists had been caught off guard, they still held a defensive position with absolute advantage. On their side, more than half of their forces had been deployed; to act rashly without opening the situation would likely result in heavy losses.

Qiu Yimeng’s mind raced as she waited for Yang Kai’s arrival, while simultaneously directing many martial artists to bombard Yang Kang’s estate from afar.

Like flowers blooming everywhere, none of Qiu Yimeng’s men engaged Yang Kang’s martial artists directly. Instead, they stood aloof in the high air, releasing the power of various Martial Skills and treasures, generously expending their True Yuan.

In just a short while, Yang Kang’s estate began to crumble. Vast sections of buildings collapsed, while the martial artists beneath scrambled to defend and dodge like headless flies.

Though casualties were not heavy, this scene was deeply humiliating.

Unable to restrain themselves, some leapt into the high air, attempting to regain ground.

Before Gao Rangfeng could stop them, those few who ascended the sky were gradually consumed by the forces under Qiu Yimeng’s command.

The situation looked exceedingly favorable, invigorating the many martial artists who longed to charge en masse, seize Yang Kang or snatch the command flag, and claim victory.

Huo Xingchen muttered from the side, “Qiu Yimeng, having Ying Jiu infiltrate—doesn’t this break the Yang Family’s succession war rules?”

Qiu Yimeng shook her head. “Ying Jiu knows his limits. If simply showing up in front of Yang Kang violated the rules, then how could the Blood Servants ever be brought out?”

“But if he infiltrates, neither initiating attacks nor seizing the command flag are permitted. What’s the point of doing this?” Huo Xingchen could not understand.

“To intimidate him,” Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly.

Huo Xingchen sneered. Clearly, he did not believe this explanation. Qiu Yimeng wasn’t bored enough for such a stunt; she was likely creating a ruse to make Yang Kang mistakenly think Yang Kai was nearby.

After all, they hadn’t seen Yang Kai since yesterday, but Ying Jiu and Yang Kai were inseparable—wherever Ying Jiu showed, Yang Kai was surely hiding in ambush, scheming.

Huo Xingchen nodded inwardly, confirming his suspicions.

“Where is Fifth Young Master?” Below, Gao Rangfeng anxiously shouted. Though young, Gao Rangfeng was the heir of the Gao Family and not weak in cultivation. Yet he was just a bystander in the succession war. Now that danger loomed over his doorstep, he could only have his men temporarily defend while waiting for Yang Kang to take charge.

“I’m here!” Yang Kang appeared from the ruins, gloomy, accompanied by Tang Yuxian. His cold eyes swept the heights, letting out a cold snort.

“Fifth Young Master!” Gao Rangfeng breathed a sigh of relief and hurried over. “Qiu Yimeng has led an attack; the estate was caught unprepared. Over twenty have died.”

“I know.” Yang Kang nodded lightly, then bellowed, “Ninth Brother, come out and speak!”

“Fifth Young Master.” Qiu Yimeng smiled thinly as she called out, standing mid-air with an alluring curve and slender figure. The night breeze lifted her trouser legs, revealing an ankle of pure white that gleamed like jade under the moonlight, captivating hearts.

Even on this chaotic battlefield, many young and vigorous male martial artists greedily gazed at that flash of white, secretly moved.

With Lan Chudie and Luo Xiaoman accompanying her, and the stunning Hu Family sisters nearby, many feasted their eyes and envied the men of Yang Kai’s residence.

They suddenly realized how many beauties Yang Kai had in his household—something absent from Yang Kang’s estate.

The young lady’s face was warm and gentle as she greeted Yang Kang, but her subordinates relentlessly unleashed Martial Skills and treasures downward in a fierce assault.

“Where is Ninth Brother?” Yang Kang frowned; displeased, clearly feeling it was Yang Kai’s place to confront him. Though Qiu Yimeng’s status was high, she was not entitled to speak in such a scenario.

“Fifth Young Master, Yang Kai is occupied with urgent matters and can't come out now. I will handle the battle here. Let’s keep it to a light exchange and not hurt our relationship,” she said with a soft chuckle and a subtle coquettish sway.

Yang Kang's expression darkened as he laughed grimly, “Very well, Ninth Brother clearly disregards me, Fifth Brother. If that's the case, I won’t hold back either—once I strike, there will be no retreat!”

His anger flared.

This succession war was a battle for the future headship of the Yang Family. Brothers competed through influence and charisma. Now, Ninth Brother sent troops but did not appear himself; this slight stung Yang Kang’s pride. He was ambitious and proud, refusing to tolerate such contempt.

Angered, he ordered a forceful charge straight into the enemy lines to disrupt them.

Gao Rangfeng was startled. Though the attackers from Yang Kai were more numerous and overall stronger, the defensive position was advantageous. If they waited for their True Yuan to wane, they could counterattack and finish things decisively.

Moreover, seeing such a fierce assault from Yang Kai’s men, other princes would surely act, unwilling to watch idly. Delaying was wise; if Yang Kai’s rear caught fire, his men would be forced to defend, allowing others to ambush from rear and flank, easily wiping out Yang Kai.

But Yang Kang, in his rage, ignored all this, fixated solely on recovering his face. Such recklessness would only facilitate enemy assassination.

Gao Rangfeng hurried to stop him. “Fifth Young Master, I think it's better to defend and not engage for now—”

Before he finished, Yang Kang impatiently interrupted, “They’re taking a piss on my head, and you want me to endure? If it were you, could you bear it?”

Gao Rangfeng paused, sensing Yang Kang had a point, but quickly rallied his wits. “That’s a different matter—”

Before he could finish, Yang Kang already commanded the attack.

A large group of martial artists charged fiercely upward, illuminating the air with Martial Skills and treasure radiance, quickly closing distance with Qiu Yimeng’s forces.

Huo Xingchen laughed aloud, “Yang Kang is straightforward, as expected.”

Qiu Yimeng lightly shook her head. “He relies on sheer numbers!”

Not a single member of the Yang Family was an idiot. Even if Yang Kang was a little inferior, he was not foolish enough to throw his own people into a trap.

This was his estate. All his support and forces were here, so naturally, he was unafraid of Qiu Yimeng’s contingent.

As she spoke, Qiu Yimeng issued several more orders.

Yang Kang’s estate martial artists, full of righteous momentum and anger, charged despite the swirling True Yuan attacks from above. When they closed to within about ten zhang, Qiu Yimeng’s troops suddenly scattered.

The sudden change stunned the attackers, who faced enemies dispersing in all directions, unsure whom to pursue.

Yang Kang was still below watching, unable to issue commands in time.

After a moment’s pause, the attackers aimlessly splintered off to pursue in all directions.

“Surround!” Qiu Yimeng shouted coldly. Immediately, everyone turned to bare their teeth and unleashed Martial Skills.

The sky blazed with dazzling light, blinding all present. Amid the chaos, screams sounded, and blood rained like raindrops.

Yang Kang’s heart jolted; he sensed disaster.

He saw Qiu Yimeng’s people bloom and recede like flowers, and then the attackers vanishing without trace.

Thud, thud, thud—

Corpses dropped continuously from the sky, smashing to the ground as mangled flesh.

In less than half the time of a tea cup, the first clash had ended.

Yang Kang’s estate suffered heavy losses.

“Miss Qiu, this is really unnecessary,” said Di Mo beside Qiu Yimeng, shaking his head. “If you just captured the young man below, wouldn’t that be enough to win?”

“That’s true,” Qiu Yimeng nodded gently.

“Then let me act. Though the woman next to him is strong, she probably can’t stop me.”

Qiu Yimeng smiled. “Senior Di, no disrespect, but that’s a Yang Family Blood Servant. After unleashing the Blood Fury Technique, she can contend with the peak masters of the Divine Roaming Realm. Can you guarantee to defeat her quickly?”

“Hmm... that’s difficult,” Di Mo admitted. He hadn’t expected Tang Yuxian to be so powerful. Though he was roughly at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm himself, he’d be no match for her, but he could buy time.

With Yang Kai absent, neither Xiao Shun nor Ying Jiu could engage. Even if they restrained Tang Yuxian, their remaining forces would struggle to take down Yang Kang.

Why hasn’t that bastard shown up? Qiu Yimeng was furious inside but kept calm outside.

If Yang Kai were here, leading Xiao Shun and Ying Jiu to attack Yang Kang, things would be much simpler.

“But now I really need your help, Senior,” she said abruptly. With Yang Kai missing, Di Mo had to act. She had planned to keep him in reserve for other Yang Family juniors, but now that plan was ruined.

Yang Kang’s estate had already suffered a setback. It was impossible to lure them into another frontal assault. The only option was a direct attack.

“No problem, Miss Qiu! Just tell me who to hit!” Di Mo chuckled fiercely.

“There’s no fixed target. I want the scene as chaotic as possible—kill at least a few strong ones, like Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage combatants, hehe.”

“That’s easy!” Di Mo laughed, shooting a dark light downward.
