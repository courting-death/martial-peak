## Chapter 502 — Found them!

The Divine Roaming Realm marks a major threshold for martial artists; many spend their entire lives unable to break through it. Yet for the young leaders of various factions, this boundary is not an insurmountable challenge.

Once one ascends into the Divine Roaming Realm, how far one can advance in martial cultivation depends on personal effort and fortune. However, for most people, reaching the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm is their absolute limit.

Because of the emergence of these Divine Roaming Realm warriors, the alchemy workshops have produced a great many Mystery-Grade Pills designed for refining Divine Sense, resulting in immense consumption of resources. Fortunately, Yang Kai had accumulated a significant stockpile, along with the command flags seized from the Yang Kang and Yang Shen estates, which he promptly exchanged with the family for materials. The Bamboo Segment Gang also purchases supplies daily, so for now, materials aren’t an issue.

Besides the frequent breakthroughs of the younger generation of warriors, those of the older generation have also made considerable progress.

For example, Guan Chile of the Blood Battle Gang had been stuck at the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm for a solid seven or eight years.

He had always thought that this was his lifetime achievement, his personal limit; he never imagined that after arriving at Yang Kai’s estate and consuming the Mystery-Grade Pills there, the bottleneck troubling him for so long would loosen within just half a month. Another half month later, he successfully broke through to the Fourth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Since then, his cultivation has steadily grown, and now his position at the Fourth Stage is firmly established.

When Guan Chile broke through to the Fourth Stage, he couldn’t hold back his tears, sobbing uncontrollably. The Hu family sisters comforted him for quite some time.

It wasn’t only Guan Chile; the Divine Roaming Realm experts from major factions, most in their forties, fifties, or sixties, find it increasingly difficult to improve their power at this age and strength level.

Yet, since the Mystery-Grade Pills brewed by the alchemists of Yao Wang Valley appeared, many have felt their bottlenecks relax, sensing a quicker absorption of Spiritual Qi than before, giving rise to an almost transcendent sensation.

They have no idea what causes this phenomenon.

Although the Mystery-Grade Pills are of good quality and high grade, they cannot fundamentally alter one’s cultivation aptitude. Yet the Mystery-Grade Pills produced within Yang Kai’s estate seem to have this extraordinary effect.

Both the young and older generations have broken through, but the most exhilarating progress has been among the Blood Servants!

Due to family interference, only two among the nine Blood Servants—Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian—were allowed to participate in the succession war, but Qiu Yimeng did not withhold their share of the Mystery-Grade Pills.

Miss Qiu knows well that these Blood Servants represent the foundation for Yang Kai’s future foothold in the Yang Family, so she would never neglect them.

Now, more than half of the nine Blood Servants have broken through and ascended to the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm! Among them are Qu Gaoyi, Ying Jiu, Tu Feng, Tang Yuxian, and Xiao Shun.

The remaining four followed Yang Kai later; though they haven’t reached the Ninth Stage, their power has rapidly increased, making them undeniably stronger than when they first came over to join him!

The Blood Servants are ecstatic and deeply grateful.

Breaking through from the Eighth to the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm is an arduous and challenging endeavor beyond words. Given time, each of them has the capability and aptitude to break through to the Ninth Stage.

But... that will likely be five, ten years, or even longer from now!

The rapid improvement of everyone’s strength is plainly visible and uplifting.

In the end, they could only deceive themselves with the simple explanation that the feng shui of Yang Kai’s estate is excellent!

In truth, everyone knows it’s the credit of those Mystery-Grade Pills. The Mystery-Grade Pills produced at Yang Kai’s estate seem to possess some miraculous and profound properties that fundamentally improve one’s aptitude.

But this remains a silent secret.

Inside the room, Yang Kai’s expression was calm as he toyed with a small sword in his hand.

This sword was a secret treasure he got from Dong Qinghan at Po Jing Lake: a Heaven-Grade Upper-Level Divine Soul Treasure.

These two months of seclusion have greatly increased Yang Kai’s power. Rarely had he devoted such a long time without distraction, focusing solely on cultivation.

In his memories, only during the breakthrough to the True Yuan Realm at that otherworldly place had he spent several consecutive months in seclusion.

He was now truly only one step away from the Divine Roaming Realm!

With Mystery-Grade Pills supplied at the estate for the warriors, how could the head of the family lack them? Moreover, these Mystery-Grade Pills were specially concocted for him by his Senior Sister, making their effect stronger than others.

His True Yuan had reached the standard of the Divine Roaming Realm, and his Divine Sense had become solid and powerful. Closing his eyes and focusing his mind, Yang Kai could even see the dazzling, radiant, multicolored Warm Spirit Lotus again—this supreme sacred item for nurturing Divine Sense had finally reappeared in his vision.

For two months, Yang Kai had done nothing but cultivate and refine the remaining two secret treasures.

The Mystery-Grade Middle-Level mirror had already been fully refined. Now, the small sword in his hand was ready for use as well.

Yet he was just a little short of breaking through to the Divine Roaming Realm.

Yang Kai always felt that this small sword still hadn’t fully fused with his Divine Sense. Perhaps it was because he had yet to form a Sea of Consciousness. After all, this was a Divine Soul Treasure; though usable without reaching the Divine Roaming Realm, it couldn’t unleash its full potential.

If he could perfectly merge this sword with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai believed that would mark the moment of his ascension.

He thought deeply but could find no breakthrough. Still, he was not anxious. He had spent over a dozen days continuously sitting in meditation, trying to harmonize his Divine Sense with the sword.

Suddenly, a steady knocking came from outside. Startled from his reverie, Yang Kai took a deep breath and said, “Come in.”

The door opened, and Qiu Yimeng entered cautiously. Seeing that Yang Kai showed no displeasure, she relaxed somewhat.

She knew Yang Kai was secluded, attempting to break into the Divine Roaming Realm, and had dared not disturb him all these two months. But today, she had no choice, so naturally, she was somewhat nervous.

“What is it?” Yang Kai glanced up at her. After two months, Miss Qiu had grown even more radiant, brightening his mood despite the frustration from cultivation difficulties.

“There’s someone named Pang Chi who wants to see you,” Qiu Yimeng said quietly.

“Pang Chi?” Yang Kai frowned. “What does he want?”

Pang Chi is the leader of the Bamboo Segment Gang, one of the earliest insignificant forces Yang Kai had gathered in Zhongdu. Yang Kai had never let them join the succession battle because their strength was uneven and they would be slaughtered on the battlefield. Instead, they collected supplies, gathered intelligence, and transmitted messages in Zhongdu on his behalf.

Since the succession war began, roughly once a month, the Bamboo Segment Gang secretly transported supplies to Yang Kai’s estate in War City. Over time, Pang Chi has performed well.

Yet he never showed himself, as appearing in War City would be unsafe for Yang Kai’s allies. This time he came personally, clearly to report something important.

Qiu Yimeng furrowed her brows and replied, “He didn’t specify the matter, only asked me to pass on three words to you: Found them!”

Found them!

In that instant, Yang Kai understood why Pang Chi personally risked coming to War City.

Before Qiu Yimeng finished speaking, she suddenly felt her body lighten; the roaring wind rushed past her ears and the scenery vanished swiftly from sight. When she regained consciousness, Yang Kai was holding her waist, rushing forward at full speed like a bolt of lightning.

“Where is he?” Yang Kai anxiously asked while speeding along.

“The side hall,” Qiu Yimeng replied.

Her expression shifted slightly. Since meeting Yang Kai, she had rarely seen him lose composure, yet now he clearly displayed a mix of nervousness and anticipation. His eyes shone with boundless unease.

For some unknown reason, Qiu Yimeng’s heart fluttered as she instinctively grabbed Yang Kai’s clothes, pressing close to him. Even she could not explain this gesture.

Miss Qiu had never been a delicate woman. She was always intelligent and perceptive.

The pair’s intimate appearance as they dashed through the estate blew past Huo Xingchen and Dong Qinghan, who were walking toward them.

The eldest young master, Huo Xingchen, did not even have time to greet them before Yang Kai vanished like a whirlwind.

Moments later, a fierce gust of wind roared by, stirring up dust all along the way.

Huo Xingchen shook his folding fan and frowned, “Who was Young Master Kai carrying, running so fast?”

“Seems to be Miss Qiu,” Dong Fatty wiped the sweat from his forehead, hardly believing his eyes.

“No way?” Huo Xingchen widened his eyes. “In broad daylight... Has Young Master Kai messed up his training? Why the rush?”

“Junior Brother isn’t that kind of person!” Lan Chudie, standing beside Dong Qinghan, suddenly shot Huo Xingchen a glare.

Huo Xingchen gave an awkward laugh. “Lady, I didn’t mean any offense.”

“Hmph!” Lan Chudie took a breath, her ample bosom almost bursting through her clothes, then turned and left.

After she left, Huo Xingchen slowly shook his head. “Your lady probably won’t win Young Master Kai’s favor. They’re just not compatible.”

Dong Qinghan smiled helplessly. Dong Fatty naturally understood Lan Chudie’s feelings well, but the falling flower may have affection, yet the flowing water remains indifferent—things beyond control.

Especially now, with so many beauties gathering at the estate, many harboring feelings for Yang Kai. However, Yang Kai had been in seclusion for two months, disciplined like a monk, never leaving his room.

If it were Huo Xingchen, he would probably be indulging in nightly revelries.

In some ways, Dong Fatty deeply admired his cousin. He thought only someone like Qiu Yimeng could truly match Yang Kai; although Lan Chudie was excellent, she lacked something.

At the side hall, Pang Chi waited nervously. Though bringing important news, he kept checking his attire, sitting upright and motionless.

A figure flashed at the door as Yang Kai entered with Qiu Yimeng in his arms.

The Bamboo Segment Gang leader’s expression froze blank. He quickly cleared his throat and averted his gaze.
