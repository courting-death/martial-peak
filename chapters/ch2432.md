## Chapter 2432 — Shattered Origin

After quietly reflecting on his gains this time, Yang Kai finally rose to his feet.

Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi were nearby. He didn’t know when they had arrived, but they must have been drawn by the commotion he caused. However, both of them kept their distance and didn’t dare approach.

Now, seeing Yang Kai stand up, the two women exchanged a glance and gracefully floated over.

“Master, what secret technique were you comprehending just now? Why did your appearance and physical state keep changing?” Liu Yan asked nervously.

“My appearance kept changing?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise. He had thought it was just a dream, but it turned out to be real. No wonder he was able to comprehend the Laws of Time and condense the seal of the Great Emperor of Time’s secret technique—his body had truly been shifting from old age to youth and back again, recording the passage of years and time through those changes. With that, it made sense he could grasp the Laws of Time.

“Yes, you looked so pitiful when you were old,” Hua Qingsi nodded from the side.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and didn’t mind. Everyone experiences birth, aging, sickness, and death—this is a cycle. After comprehending the Law of Time, Yang Kai saw through it all.

After pondering for a moment, he said, “That was the Great Emperor of Time’s secret technique!”

Hearing this, Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi’s eyes both lit up. Liu Yan exclaimed in delight, “Master, did you obtain the Great Emperor of Time’s inheritance?”

Although Yang Kai also possessed the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s inheritance, that thing wasn’t something a person could cultivate. The Great Emperor of Time was different—if he truly obtained that inheritance, his future would be smooth sailing.

Yang Kai shook his head and said, “I also thought the Four Seasons Beads hid the Great Emperor of Time’s inheritance, but that wasn’t the case. It was just one of the Great Emperor of Time’s secret techniques. Still... I did gain a lot.”

Being able to get started on the Laws of Time, Yang Kai felt that even if he didn’t obtain the Great Emperor of Time’s inheritance, it didn’t matter. As long as he kept cultivating, he would one day reach the same heights—or even surpass them.

But before that, he needed to cultivate the Laws of Space to the utmost. Biting off more than he could chew would only slow him down, and Yang Kai understood this well.

“How long has it been?” Yang Kai suddenly asked.

He had been trapped in that cycle of time, unable to sense its passage, so he had no idea how long this cultivation session had lasted.

“Almost a year!” Hua Qingsi replied.

Ever since Yang Kai was injured and entered this place, Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi had sensed his presence. By their reckoning, it had been almost exactly a year.

“A year!” Yang Kai was startled. He thought that even if it took some time, it wouldn’t be more than two or three months. He never expected a whole year to have passed.

In other words, during the first year the Shattered Star Sea opened, aside from healing, he had spent all his time comprehending the mysteries of the Four Seasons Bead. He wondered if that was a waste of time.

Yang Kai also didn’t know how long the Shattered Star Sea would remain open. If it only lasted a year, wouldn’t he have wasted this opportunity for nothing?

Thinking of this, Yang Kai’s face darkened, and a vague sense of crisis welled up inside him.

“I’ll go out and see what’s going on here!” Yang Kai said, then turned and darted out of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Just like that, a year had passed. Yet he hadn’t gained any benefits, so Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling anxious.

After leaving the Xuan Realm Pearl, Yang Kai returned to the massive meteorite. Looking around, he found the scenery was the same as when he first arrived at the Shattered Star Sea—nothing much had changed.

But Yang Kai was certain this wasn’t the place he first arrived. He had probably traveled billions of li away, since the Meteorite Sea had been moving forward at incredible speed. Who knew where it had taken him?

With a flicker, Yang Kai flew out of the Meteorite Sea and summoned his wooden boat.

It was said that the Shattered Star Sea was a great opportunity for Dao Origin Realm cultivators, but Yang Kai didn’t know where that opportunity lay. He could only wander around and try his luck.

After several days, he still hadn’t encountered anything unusual. Instead, he ran into a few Starry Sky storms. The storms in the Shattered Star Sea were terrifying—wherever they swept, even the void was torn apart. Watching this made Yang Kai’s scalp tingle, and he didn’t dare get caught up in one.

He didn’t encounter any other cultivators either.

In this vast Starry Sky, it seemed he was the only living person. This made Yang Kai wonder if the Shattered Star Sea had already closed, causing all the other cultivators to leave while he was left behind.

If that was the case, it would be terrible.

One day, as Yang Kai was flying through the void, he suddenly felt a slight warmth on the back of his hand.

He raised his eyebrows and looked at the back of his hand.

That was where his Star Seal was branded. At this moment, the Star Seal was emitting a faint light, and he could sense an extremely weak force from a certain direction, pulling at his Star Seal.

Yang Kai was puzzled, not knowing what the Star Seal was resonating with.

After a moment’s thought, he changed direction and flew toward the source of that force.

No matter what was over there, at least it was something—better than running around like a headless fly.

The Starry Sky was vast. Even at full speed, Yang Kai flew for two hours. After that, a shattered Cultivation Star appeared before his eyes. It wasn’t particularly large or small—about average.

It was just like the first shattered star Yang Kai saw when he entered the Shattered Star Sea—most of it was destroyed, with only a small part remaining in the void.

Looking around, this ruined Cultivation Star was lifeless, without a trace of green. Even after tens of thousands of years, it seemed to still carry the terrifying aura of the Great Emperors’ life-and-death battle, making one shudder at the sight.

The force pulling at his Star Seal was coming from this shattered star.

Yang Kai was amazed, not knowing what was so special about this shattered star that it could resonate with his Star Seal. Controlling his wooden boat, he shot toward a certain spot on the star like a rainbow.

Soon, he landed on its surface. Looking around, all he saw was a devastated landscape, with countless large and small craters, each as dark as an abyss.

After arriving, the light from the Star Seal on the back of his hand grew a little brighter. Yang Kai immediately knew he’d found the right place.

Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai probed the area. Soon, his eyebrows shot up in delight and he exclaimed, “Stellar Origin?”

He possessed the Stellar Origin of Dark Star and, as the Star Lord of Dark Star, was extremely familiar with the aura of a Stellar Origin. On this shattered Cultivation Star, there was still some Stellar Origin power remaining.

However, perhaps because the place was too badly damaged, the Stellar Origin was also broken and incomplete.

For cultivators of the Star Realm, a Stellar Origin was a precious thing. Those who possessed it could better comprehend the laws of heaven and earth through its power, making breakthroughs and advancement much easier.

But it was very difficult for cultivators of the Star Realm to obtain Stellar Origins, because only Cultivation Stars could produce them. Such treasures were rare in the Star Realm, and even if they existed, they were taken by powerful experts—ordinary cultivators rarely saw them.

Yet here there was a Stellar Origin—though incomplete, though badly fragmented, it was still Origin power all the same!

So the legends were true. In the Shattered Star Sea, there really were many broken Stellar Origins. If Dao Origin Realm cultivators could absorb these powers, it would be a huge benefit for their future advancement to Emperor.

“Could it be that the Star Seal resonated with the Power of Origin and led me here?” Yang Kai wondered to himself. But with no one to confirm it, he didn’t know if his guess was correct.

If so, then the Star Seal was like a guiding light. As long as he followed the places it pointed to, he would surely find the Power of Origin.

As Yang Kai was speculating, he sensed something and turned to look at the sky. Two dazzling beams of light fell from above, landing nearby moments later.

As the light faded, two figures appeared.

Both were men who appeared to come from the same sect; their auras and clothing were similar. He didn’t know how they had met up in the Shattered Star Sea. Both had reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and their cultivation was solid and powerful. They didn’t seem like ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivators—most likely, they were disciples of a great sect.

Yang Kai noticed that both men had a Star Seal on the back of their hands, just like his, glowing faintly.

It seemed these two, like him, had been guided here by the Star Seal.

At the sight of these two, Yang Kai was not alarmed but delighted.

As long as there were other living people here, it meant he wasn’t alone in the Shattered Star Sea. He just hadn’t met anyone these past few days because of bad luck. In an instant, Yang Kai’s face was filled with excitement as he looked at the two men.

The two didn’t know why Yang Kai was so excited, but both wore arrogant expressions, looking down on everyone. After glancing at Yang Kai, they ignored him and released their Divine Sense to scan the surroundings.

One of them frowned and said, “The Power of Origin here is so thin.”

“Yeah, it’s not as good as the one we found yesterday,” the other agreed.

“Still, some is better than none. Grains of sand make a tower, and little by little, it adds up. We can’t just let it go because there’s not much.” As he spoke, he glanced at Yang Kai and barked, “What are you looking at? Get lost!”

The other sneered, “The Stellar Origin here is ours. If you know what’s good for you, scram. Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave even if you want to.”

The two men took turns threatening him, their words sharp and menacing, making it clear they wanted Yang Kai gone. Hearing this, Yang Kai could only stare at them, speechless and exasperated.
