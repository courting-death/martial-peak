## Chapter 1468 — You Are Too Naive

Although Xue Yue and Yang Kai had once lain bare and entwined on the Dead Star, that place was desolate and devoid of spectators; it could never compare to how explosive this scene was.

Furthermore, seeing Yang Kai offer no resistance and allow that yao woman to act as she pleased made Xue Yue's lungs feel as if they would burst; her body trembled and her knuckles turned white from clenching, until she could bear it no longer and let out an angry cry.

After shouting, Xue Yue realized her reaction had been excessive and hastily added in a righteous tone, "Embracing and cuddling in public — you lot truly have no shame!"

As she spoke she ground her teeth and glared at Yang Kai as if she wanted to skin him alive.

"You nearly scared me to death..." Shan Qingluo theatrically patted her high chest, then with a languid flicker of mood shifted anger into coquettishness, casting a sidelong glance at Xue Yue and chuckling, while to Yang Kai she breathed softly, "We'll settle our affairs later."

"Agreed!" Yang Kai responded, nodding solemnly, relief washing over him; from observing the situation he knew this bout of commotion had likely calmed Shan Qingluo's temper. Yet after years apart the enchantress's allure had only grown — when that reproachful gaze slid across him, it nearly stole his very soul.

He thought for a moment, then asked softly, "Do you bear enmity with them?"

"Not exactly, it's just... humans and yao cannot coexist peacefully." Shan Qingluo pursed her lips and smiled lightly. "Since you are with Biluo, you should have heard some things about me, right?"

"That's right."

"Then that's that." Shan Qingluo laughed lightly and briefly recounted the earlier events. By coincidence, after sensing Yang Kai's presence in the Imperial Garden she had been searching for him, penetrating the garden until she accidentally arrived here. While she was examining an inscription in the palace, Xue Yue burst in with a group of people.

Then Yang Kai and Biluo arrived; those on Xue Yue's side had not even had the chance to strike.

"I see..." Yang Kai inclined his head. He already had a plan: since there was no deep grudge between the sides, there was no need for a full-scale fight here. With that thought he looked up, grinned at Xue Yue, and said loudly, "Third Young Master. There's an old saying — it's better to settle enmities than to make them. It's fate that we meet here; why not end this matter now?"

"Fine!" Unexpectedly, Xue Yue accepted at once, so readily that Yang Kai was stunned. But his brow soon furrowed; something was off — for her to agree so briskly there must be another motive.

Sure enough, Xue Yue smiled and said to Yang Kai with unhurried calm, "In the name of our past acquaintance, I will not make things difficult for you. I won't have word spread that the Hengluo Commerce Guild bullies the weak. But..."

"But what?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

"Don't be so tense." Xue Yue chuckled with an air of self-satisfaction. "My demand is simple — I only want one person."

"A person?" Yang Kai's face darkened. "Which person?"

He instinctively looked toward Shan Qingluo, thinking Xue Yue might be taking out her anger on the Enchantress Queen.

Everyone present thought the same, including Shan Qingluo herself; she knew her own charm and that no man had ever remained composed before her. Hearing this, she giggled coquettishly and, as if embarrassed, said, "Sorry, Young Master, if you were asking for me you may be disappointed — I already have someone I love. I have longed for him for decades and would not part from him now that we've reunited."

Saying this, she boldly slipped an arm through Yang Kai's and pressed her supple body against him, extremely intimate.

A flicker of strangeness passed through Xue Yue's eyes; she closed her fan and laughed loudly, derisively looking at Shan Qingluo, "Yao woman, don't be so presumptuous before me — when did I ever say I intended to keep you? Your face is truly thick!"

For some reason she wanted to seize any opportunity to taunt and ridicule Shan Qingluo, something she would never have done in the past.

"Uh..." Even Shan Qingluo, with her calm temperament and cultivation, couldn't help flushing crimson and asked in astonishment, "Then who do you want?"

As she spoke she glanced suspiciously at Biluo, who quickly waved her hands to indicate she had no acquaintance or involvement with Xue Yue.

“What this Young Master wants—” Xue Yue’s cold gaze locked onto Yang Kai as the corner of her lips curved upward. Holding her folding fan, she pointed at him from afar and declared, “—is the man beside you! Stay, and I won’t trouble these two women. This Young Master always keeps his word!”

Everyone turned their eyes to Yang Kai at once, wondering what sort of grudge between these two men could make Xue Yue forsake such a flower-like beauty and insist on keeping Yang Kai.

Any man would surely choose that woman instead.

"This grudge must be no ordinary thing," the experts around Xue Yue mused — perhaps rivaling a father's murder or a stolen wife... but they were more curious when the Third Young Master had incurred such hatred; they'd never heard of it before.

"You want me to stay?" Yang Kai's expression was odd.

"Are you afraid?" Xue Yue lifted her fair chin, triumphant and aggressive. "Or is it that you're guilty?"

"Ridiculous — what would I be guilty of? I didn't steal nor plunder."

"You dare say you didn't steal or plunder?" Xue Yue's emotions unexpectedly flared; her eyebrows rose and she glared at Yang Kai through gritted teeth.

Catching the meaning behind her words, Yang Kai let out a dry laugh. From several dozen zhang away, he gazed at Xue Yue, unsure what to say. After a long moment, he sighed softly and said earnestly, “Third Young Master, a melon forced off the vine is never sweet. Why push this so far? You walk your own broad road, I’ll cross my single-plank bridge—let the river water and the well water stay apart, and all will be well. But if you insist on pressing me step by step… then we’ll just have to drag each other down, fish and net alike.”

"Drag each other down?" Xue Yue seemed to have heard the most delightful joke; her eyes narrowed. "Do you think you have the qualification and power for that now?"

“Why don’t you try and find out?” Yang Kai sneered coldly. “Besides, it’s just a single word from me—do you really think you could stop it?”

Hearing this, Xue Yue's face changed drastically and she shouted, "How dare you!"

She was a very clever woman and could sense the threat behind Yang Kai's words; the other's remark clearly implied exposing her greatest secret — how could she not be alarmed?

"What is there for me not to dare?" Yang Kai grinned triumphantly. "It won't cost me much, but Third Young Master... hehe."

His laughter held deep intent, making Xue Yue even more terrified: "If you do that, you will regret it!"

"That depends on your attitude, Third Young Master." Yang Kai remained composed, looking as if he held the winning hand.

“I…” Xue Yue was momentarily at a loss for words, her pretty face darkening as if coated in frost. The many experts standing beside her exchanged bewildered looks, unable to believe what they were seeing. They knew full well how formidable their Third Young Master’s methods were—yet now, she had been driven into such an awkward corner by just a few words from an unknown cultivator of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, as though she were being toyed with in the palm of his hand.

This had never happened before.

What leverage did he have on the Third Young Master that made him so cautious? The Third Young Master's surrounding Third Stage experts now grew curious; one after another they itched to have Yang Kai reveal the secret to ease their curiosity.

In their eyes the Third Young Master was a perfect man; for such a one to have a hidden weakness was irresistible curiosity.

The standoff froze the scene; Xue Yue's thoughts churned and swayed.

This was the first time she had found herself unable to make a decision. Letting Yang Kai and that enchantress leave—she absolutely could not accept it. Back then, out of gratitude for Yang Kai saving her life, she hadn’t tried too hard to stop him from leaving Rainfall Star, but over the years, she had come to regret that moment of leniency again and again.

She should never have let that brat leave; she should have bound him to her side to assist her.

Apart from a handful of closest kin, only he knew her secret; for both emotional and rational reasons she should not let him slip from sight. Besides, Xue Yue was confident in her charm — given time, how could he fail to fall for her? That would both eliminate the risk of his exposing her secret and capture his heart and body in one stroke.

So she did not want to let Yang Kai go; if she missed this chance again she did not know when she'd see this bastard again.

But Yang Kai's threat lingered, and Xue Yue dared not be too domineering for fear of truly pushing him to reveal the secret.

Countless thoughts flashed through her mind like lightning, until Xue Yue’s eyes suddenly lit up. A soft laugh escaped her lips as she looked at Yang Kai with calm certainty and said, “Stop trying to scare me—you won’t do it.”

"Nonsense!" Yang Kai scoffed.

"Is that so?" Xue Yue sneered. "Then say it — if you have the guts, say it! But guess what the consequences will be; I hope you'll be able to bear them!"

Her performance was like that of a rogue; she deliberately glanced at Shan Qingluo while speaking.

Yang Kai frowned and pondered, his face darkening.

He had not really considered the consequences; Xue Yue's reminder made him realize the gravity of her words. If he truly exposed her secret, Xue Yue would have no choice but to kill witnesses — in other words, Shan Qingluo and Biluo would be marked for death, and perhaps the experts around her would die too!

After all, the Hengluo Commerce Guild would not care about the lives of a few Origin Returning Realm cultivators to protect such a secret.

"You have grown much more shameless over the years!" Yang Kai mocked Xue Yue.

"Right back at you!" Xue Yue laughed lightly. "You're no better yourself."

"And you think that will make me hesitate?" Yang Kai coldly looked at her. "You are too naive."
