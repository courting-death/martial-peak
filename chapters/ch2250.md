## Chapter 2250 — That Brat Yang

“Is that so?” Ning Yuanshu smiled faintly, his expression full of meaning as he stared at Duan Yuanshan. “Then may I ask, how did my Eldest Brother die?”

Duan Yuanshan’s body trembled, and he frowned. “What do you mean by that, Young Palace Master?”

“Heh…” Ning Yuanshu chuckled. “My Eldest Brother, Ning Yuancheng—surely City Lord Duan knows him?”

Duan Yuanshan fell silent. Of course he knew Ning Yuancheng. When the Divine Spirit appeared last time, Ning Yuancheng had come to Fenglin City with some attendants. He also knew about the auction that was held afterward, which Ning Yuancheng attended as well.

Ning Yuanshu said, “As far as I know, my Eldest Brother disappeared after attending your Fenglin City’s auction. Although his body was never found, the soul lamp kept in the palace went out, which clearly meant he met with misfortune. Even if the incident didn’t happen in Fenglin City, it was not far from here. Shouldn’t City Lord Duan give me an explanation?”

Hearing this, Duan Yuanshan’s expression shifted unpredictably.

He thought the other party was here to settle old scores.

Although Ning Yuancheng’s death had nothing to do with him, and he knew nothing about it, the fact remained that the man’s last appearance was in Fenglin City, after which he was killed. No matter what, Fenglin City bore some responsibility. If Fei Sheng Palace really pressed the matter, Duan Yuanshan would have no way to clear himself.

Seeing his ugly expression, Ning Yuanshu suddenly laughed. “No need to panic, City Lord Duan. In fact, I should thank you for this…”

“Is Young Palace Master joking with me?” Duan Yuanshan looked up, his face dark.

Ning Yuanshu shook his head. “Of course not. If my Eldest Brother hadn’t died here in Fenglin City, I wouldn’t have had the chance to become Young Palace Master and sit in this position. Don’t you think I should thank you?”

Hearing this, Duan Yuanshan felt a chill instead of any joy.

His own blood brother was dead, yet this man not only showed no sadness, but was even delighted to have replaced him, and said so openly in front of everyone.

Ning Yuanshu’s vile character was clear to see. Dealing with such a person, Duan Yuanshan dared not let his guard down.

Seated at the head, Ning Yuanshu continued, “That useless brother of mine is dead, but his death caused my Sect great losses, which is truly painful. Moreover… Elder Fu, who came to investigate my brother’s death, also died in Fenglin City. Elder Fu was a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, a rare powerhouse in my Sect. He can’t just die without explanation. Shouldn’t City Lord Duan give me an account of this?”

As he spoke, his face grew colder, his gaze pressing in on Duan Yuanshan.

“Elder Fu?” Duan Yuanshan was startled, then his expression changed as he thought of someone. He called out, “Is this the person Young Palace Master means?”

As he spoke, he waved his hand. Origin Qi surged, and soon an image of a man appeared before them.

Ning Yuanshu glanced at it and nodded. “That’s him! He is my Sect’s Fu Sitong. Elder Fu!”

Duan Yuanshan’s face changed dramatically, and he muttered, “So he was an elder of your Sect. No wonder his cultivation was so profound.”

He had only just recalled this person, never expecting he was the Elder Fu Ning Yuanshu spoke of.

He wasn’t familiar with the man, but during the Demonic Qi siege, the Qin Family had contributed the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Grand Array to break out of the city. While seeking suitable candidates, this man had volunteered to join the formation. There was also a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm woman at the time. Duan Yuanshan knew both were extraordinary, but hadn’t investigated their backgrounds.

Only now did he learn that one of them was an elder of Fei Sheng Palace.

After a moment’s thought, he cupped his fists. “If Young Palace Master wishes to know how Elder Fu died, I do know a little.”

“Oh? Let’s hear it.” Ning Yuanshu raised his brows.

“A few months ago, the matter of the Ancient Great Demon’s Demonic Qi emerging near Fenglin City—Young Palace Master must have heard of it…” He then recounted what happened at that time, including how Zhuang Pan abandoned everyone and fled at the critical moment.

Zhuang Pan listened with a face like water, unable to refute, flushing red and green by turns.

The two Great Elders, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, looked at Zhuang Pan with undisguised contempt, making him wish he could crawl into a hole and never come out.

“The formation was broken, the Demonic Qi was fierce, and I was powerless to resist. I risked my life to bring the two from the Qin Family back to the city. Elder Fu did not leave immediately, but stayed behind. What happened after, I do not know. But since Elder Fu is dead, he was likely killed by the Demonic Qi.”

“I see…” Ning Yuanshu listened to his account without much suspicion, then after a moment’s thought said, “So, this isn’t City Lord Duan’s fault, but Deacon Zhuang’s, is it?”

He immediately turned his gaze to Zhuang Pan.

Zhuang Pan’s cultivation wasn’t low—he was at least Dao Origin Realm—and after joining Fei Sheng Palace, he’d gotten a Deacon’s position. He’d hoped to rise high, but now Duan Yuanshan had shifted the blame onto him.

In his heart, he cursed Duan Yuanshan viciously.

Sensing Ning Yuanshu’s icy gaze, Zhuang Pan was so frightened he dropped to his knees, all dignity lost, drawing looks of contempt from Duan Yuanshan and the Drunken Old Man.

“Young Palace Master, please see clearly. The situation that day was not as City Lord Duan says. I only did what I did because… because…” He started to make something up, but soon ran out of words, breaking into a cold sweat.

“Because what?” Ning Yuanshu sneered, his eyes cold, clearly demanding an explanation.

In his desperation, Zhuang Pan’s mind spun, and he blurted out, “I only saw that the situation was hopeless, so I retreated to preserve my life, so I could serve Young Palace Master in the future!”

After speaking, he looked at Ning Yuanshu with a fawning smile.

“That’s some impressive bootlicking!” Duan Yuanshan whispered to the Drunken Old Man. “I never knew he was so glib.”

Though he spoke quietly, everyone present was in the Dao Origin Realm, so who hadn’t heard?

“Hic…” The Drunken Old Man, still bleary-eyed, let out another loud burp.

Zhuang Pan glared at him viciously, his face alternating red and white, clearly embarrassed.

“Well, it’s rare to see such loyalty from Deacon Zhuang. Reward!” Ning Yuanshu was briefly stunned, then delighted. He casually tossed a spirit fruit, which rolled right to Zhuang Pan’s feet.

Zhuang Pan not only felt no shame, but laughed and cupped his fists. “Thank you for the reward, Young Palace Master!”

He bent down, lowered his head, and, like a dog eating scraps, bit into the spirit fruit and chewed it down.

Duan Yuanshan couldn’t bear to watch, turning his head away, disgusted to think he’d once worked with this man.

“City Lord Duan…” Ning Yuanshu turned his gaze back to Duan Yuanshan. “I have a request.”

Duan Yuanshan said, “Please speak, Young Palace Master.”

Ning Yuanshu said, “I am, after all, an outsider. As the saying goes, a strong dragon cannot suppress a local snake. This is your territory, City Lord Duan. I hope you can help me find out the cause of my brother’s death. If someone murdered him, the culprit must be found!”

Duan Yuanshan’s mouth twitched, and he was about to give a perfunctory answer when Zhuang Pan suddenly stood up and said eagerly, “If Young Palace Master wishes to investigate the Eldest Young Master’s death, I do have a suspect.”

“Oh?” Ning Yuanshu looked at him in surprise. “What do you know? Speak.”

“There’s a brat surnamed Yang who once used one of our Sect’s flying ship Secret Treasures!” Zhuang Pan said. “I once saw the Eldest Young Master use that Secret Treasure. If I’m not mistaken, that brat Yang must know something, and maybe he killed the Eldest Young Master for profit.”

“Is that so?” A cold light flashed in Ning Yuanshu’s eyes.

“Exactly!”

As soon as Zhuang Pan finished speaking, Ning Yuanshu suddenly struck out with his palm, Origin Qi surging with some secret art. Zhuang Pan was shocked and instinctively tried to defend, but at that moment, Elder Gao Shan, who had been sitting with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them. A tangible beam of light shot from his eyes, enveloping Zhuang Pan.

Zhuang Pan was instantly frozen in place. The next moment, a muffled bang sounded from his chest. With a miserable cry, he was sent flying, crashing into the wall, spitting blood, his vision spinning, and his spirit wilting.

“Young Palace Master…” he forced himself to speak, panic-stricken. “What does this mean?”

Ning Yuanshu snorted coldly. “If you had such important information, why didn’t you report it sooner?”

Zhuang Pan gaped, dumbfounded. “I thought…”

“You thought what?” Ning Yuanshu stared coldly. “You thought I didn’t want to find out how that useless brother died? Hmph, I may not have liked him, but he was still one of our Sect. Dying without explanation is unacceptable! The cause must be found, and the killer punished!”

“Yes, yes, I was careless!” Zhuang Pan replied repeatedly.

“Where is that brat Yang now?” Ning Yuanshu demanded.

“As for his whereabouts, you’ll have to ask City Lord Duan.” Zhuang Pan wiped the blood from his mouth and looked at Duan Yuanshan with a gloating expression.

Ning Yuanshu also turned his gaze, staring Duan Yuanshan down.

Duan Yuanshan frowned. “He left Fenglin City several months ago. I don’t know where he is now.”

“Which Sect is he from? Does he have any close relations in Fenglin City?” Ning Yuanshu pressed.

“I don’t know which Sect he’s from. He only came to Fenglin City two years ago, and as far as I know, he has no relatives here.”
