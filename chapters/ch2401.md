## Chapter 2401 — Ice and Fire

At those words, the faces of Ling Yinqin and the others changed dramatically.

Now, with the two top experts of the Jixu Secret Realm gathered here, it looked like a fight could break out at any moment. How could they not be terrified? When immortals clash, mortals suffer. If a battle really broke out here, everyone would be swept up in it. Would the Ice Heart Pavilion Master even be able to care about their lives? One careless move, and they would be smashed to pieces.

Over there, hearing Chi Ri threaten her like this, Bing Yun replied coldly, "Chi Ri, I do not wish to be your enemy, but if you keep pressing me, don't blame this Lord for being rude."

Chi Ri's eyelids narrowed, and flames of anger burst from his eyes.

He had known Bing Yun for so many years, but had never heard her speak to him in such a tone. Even when she was impatient before, she never showed it so openly. Bing Yun was always icy to the core, her emotions rarely showing, but today, for some reason, her words were so sharp. And from her tone, it sounded as if she really could do something to him.

This made Chi Ri burn with rage. He had always suppressed Bing Yun. Although their cultivations were about the same, because of the difference in resources, as time passed, Bing Yun became less and less his equal. He always thought he would eventually subdue her and make her his exclusive possession. But now, the woman he saw as his possession actually dared to resist him. How could Chi Ri tolerate this!

"So, you want this Lord to take you back by force!" Chi Ri said with a dark face. He secretly resolved that even if he got hurt today, he would crush Bing Yun's spirit and show her the gap in their strength.

"Yang Kai, take them and go ahead," Bing Yun quietly sent a message to Yang Kai, saying nothing more.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, slipped a few Upper-Level Emperor Yuan Pills he had refined a few days ago to Bing Yun, and said softly, "Then this Junior will await your arrival up ahead!"

He wasn't worried about Bing Yun's safety at all. With the help of ten million Upper-Level Source Crystals from him, Bing Yun must have already recovered to her peak. With a few more Upper-Level Emperor Yuan Pills as a foundation, what could Chi Ri use to fight her?

Bing Yun could not lose!

After speaking, Yang Kai quickly gave Ling Yinqin and the others a look, formed a hand seal, and urged the multi-deck ship forward.

Chi Ri paid no attention to Yang Kai and the others, nor did he try to stop them. He just stood in the air, staring quietly at Bing Yun. As far as he was concerned, as long as he could stop Bing Yun, the others' lives or deaths were irrelevant.

Over the sea, Imperial Might filled the air. The pressure, thick as a substance, clashed and sent up towering waves. Law Power surged, making heaven and earth change color.

Standing behind Chi Ri, Pang Guang felt a mountain of pressure descend on him, his face turning pale.

Even though he was also in the Emperor Realm, there was still a huge gap between him and Chi Ri and Bing Yun. These two top experts hadn't even started fighting yet, but just the collision of their auras was almost more than Pang Guang could bear.

He was shocked. Only now did he realize how big the gap was between himself and these true Emperor Realm experts.

Realizing there was no point in staying, Pang Guang looked up in the direction Yang Kai and the others had left, his figure flickering as he prepared to give chase.

He definitely couldn't intervene in this battle. All he could do was target Yang Kai and the others, looking for a chance to take revenge.

But just as he moved, Bing Yun suddenly pointed a finger at him from afar.

That finger left no trace, but an extremely icy profound intent instantly spread out, enveloping Pang Guang. He suddenly felt a breath of death rush toward him, so cold it seemed it could freeze even his Divine Soul, leaving him unable to advance or retreat.

If he were at his peak, maybe he could have struggled, but he was already seriously injured and hadn't recovered. With Bing Yun's overwhelming strength pressing down, how could he resist?

In despair and terror, he cried out, "City Lord, save me!"

Chi Ri had no intention of abandoning him. Seeing Bing Yun attack, he quickly swept his sleeve, sending a wave of scorching heat that dispersed the bone-chilling cold.

Pang Guang immediately felt much better, quickly urged his power, and fled backward, escaping more than ten li away before gasping for breath, his face full of lingering fear.

"In front of this Lord, you still have the mind to deal with others? Bing Yun, don't look down on me!" Chi Ri shouted angrily.

Bing Yun's beautiful face sank as she said in surprise, "You were hiding your strength all along!"

Although their clash lasted only a moment, Bing Yun still sensed that Chi Ri had been hiding his strength. Every time they fought over that cup of spirit tea, he had never gone all out—until now.

Shocked, she couldn't help but feel extremely grateful to have met a lucky star like Yang Kai, who had given her ten million Upper-Level Source Crystals at once to restore her strength. Without that, she would have had no chance in this fight.

"You seem to have recovered your strength too?" Chi Ri was equally shocked. He had chased her here today, thinking he could crush her with absolute advantage and make her submit, but now, it was unclear who would win. Realizing this, his face turned ugly.

Both were surprised, but as top experts at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, their minds were resilient, and they quickly regained their composure.

Bing Yun's gaze passed over Chi Ri and landed on the pale-faced Pang Guang. Her jade hand gripped the air, and a snow-white longsword suddenly appeared. The sword, like Bing Yun herself, was pure and flawless, crystal clear, like the most beautiful work of art in the world, without a trace of killing intent.

Sword in hand, Bing Yun's aura exploded. She slashed at Pang Guang from a distance, shouting, "Snow Like Clear Sky!"

As the sword fell, heaven and earth changed color, the universe shattered, and the world was turned upside down.

The icy Law Power and profound intent instantly spread out, and the rolling sea below was frozen solid in the next moment.

Snow began to fall from the sky!

Snowflakes as large as goose feathers drifted down, covering the world in white in an instant, breathtakingly beautiful.

Pang Guang, caught in the middle, didn't react at all. He just stared blankly at the stunning scene, a look of intoxication on his face, even reaching out to catch the falling snowflakes.

Frost quickly formed on his exposed skin and hair, and he was on the verge of being completely frozen.

"Great Sun in the Sky!" At that moment, Chi Ri shouted angrily. In the world of ice and snow, a blazing sun suddenly rose, bringing with it incomparable heat that instantly scattered the ice and snow. The frozen sea melted in the blink of an eye.

Two forces of completely different natures clashed over the sea for a hundred li, quickly canceling each other out.

This contest ended in a draw.

Pang Guang finally snapped out of it. Remembering the beautiful scene just now, sweat the size of beans broke out on his forehead and slid down nonstop.

He now knew he had just walked through the gates of death. If Chi Ri hadn't saved him at the critical moment, he would have died.
For someone like Bing Yun, a top expert, to strike at him without a word—Pang Guang felt both indignant and resigned. He understood all too well why Bing Yun had acted so ruthlessly: she was clearly worried he would chase after Yang Kai and the others, so she had to make the first move. Unfortunately for her, it had all come to nothing in the end.

With that thought, he quickly chased after Yang Kai and the others. He couldn't intervene in this battlefield at all—just watching was a risk to his life. If he really got involved, wouldn't he die even faster?

The only thing he could do now was chase Yang Kai and the others to distract Bing Yun.

He couldn't beat Bing Yun, but surely he could handle Yang Kai's group? If he could capture them, he could force Bing Yun to hold back, maybe even make her surrender.

If Chi Ri was pleased, his own days would be much better in the future.

"Trying to leave?" Seeing Pang Guang's movement, Bing Yun knew exactly what he was up to. Gritting her silver teeth, she pointed her sword in the air.

A pure white Ice Flower shot from the sword tip, rushing toward Pang Guang. Midway, the Ice Flower bloomed, as if it would swallow Pang Guang whole.

A figure flashed—Chi Ri suddenly appeared in front of the Ice Flower and smashed it with a punch. The violent force shattered the Ice Flower instantly.

"With this Lord here, you still have the mind to deal with others?" Chi Ri sneered. "Looks like you really underestimated me!"

Bing Yun frowned, watching Pang Guang disappear helplessly. Just dealing with Chi Ri required her full attention; she had no energy left to handle Pang Guang.

She took a deep breath, her ample chest rising slightly. In the next moment, her anxious and worried expression vanished, replaced by cold determination.

She knew that if she wanted to chase Pang Guang, she had to deal with Chi Ri first. To do that, she had to go all out, without the slightest slack or distraction.

Seeing Bing Yun's change, Chi Ri secretly praised her, but said, "Bing Yun, that whole ship of people died because of you. If you know what's good for you, surrender now, and this Lord will treat you well in the future."

With one sentence, he pronounced Yang Kai and the others' death sentence, all to disturb Bing Yun's state of mind.

But Bing Yun was unmoved. Her sword moved, and the icy Law Power spread out again, enveloping him.

Chi Ri screamed in anger, but didn't dare be careless. He unleashed his powers and began a fierce battle with Bing Yun.

In an instant, the two figures flickered back and forth over the sea, Law Power clashing, heaven and earth shattering, waves surging. The Spiritual Qi for a thousand li around was thrown into chaos.

This was a life-and-death battle between two top experts at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Such a scene was rare even in the entire Star Realm. Even more remarkable, their strengths were evenly matched, and their Law Powers were mutually restraining, making the fight all the more perilous.
