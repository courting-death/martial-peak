## Chapter 1405 — Self-Destructed

The man who could regrow a severed arm could not possibly die so easily; Yang Kai had a faint feeling that Lu Ye was not an ordinary man.

Yet at this moment inside Dragon Lair Mountain, aside from Xie Li there was only that middle-aged man from the Demon Blood Sect still alive. If Lu Ye had barged in, he wouldn't go unnoticed — Yang Yan and Wu Yi were constantly monitoring the mountain's situation.

That bastard was cunning indeed; he hadn't entered. Yang Kai's teeth itched with fury.

"Is that your only question?" Xie Li's face showed impatience.

"Yes." Yang Kai grinned at him.

"Then you can go and die!" Xie Li's expression hardened, and with a deep shout a surging tide of Saint Yuan poured from his body, visible to the naked eye. A crackling roar erupted from within him as his frame swelled, muscles bulging in a weird bronze sheen, and like a released arrow he darted at Yang Kai.

Surprise flashed across Yang Kai's eyes — he had not expected Xie Li to try to fight him up close. He did not overthink it; if the man harbored such deep hatred, this was the most satisfying way to settle it.

Thinking this, Yang Kai lifted the corner of his mouth and stood coldly watching; with a flick of his hand a strand of golden thread tore the air and shot forth.

Xie Li did not dodge or parry; instead he slowly thrust out a fist. The blow looked slow yet lethal, shimmering with golden light as if it contained a terrible power, meeting the golden thread head-on.

In a blink the fist struck the Golden Blood Threads. Yang Kai was astonished — his razor-sharp Golden Blood Threads were blocked and repelled by a single flesh-and-bone punch. Moreover, an inexplicable force transmitted back through the thread into him, churning his qi and blood.

After a brief clash Yang Kai realized Xie Li was even more troublesome than that Elder Du from Myriad Beasts Mountain had been.

No wonder he was a warrior from Yingyue Hall; his foundation alone was extraordinary. If Xie Li and that Elder Du fought one-on-one, Xie Li would certainly not be the weaker.

Yang Kai's face turned grave; he intended to use another method to stop him when suddenly things changed.

That killing intent which had surged like a rainbow — the murderous will charging toward him — Xie Li gave an odd cry as if struck by some calamity. Pain and confusion crossed his face, and instantly a glazed, blood-red film crept over his once-bright eyes.

Yang Kai frowned. He instinctively suspected some trick, yet something felt wrong and he could not tell what had overtaken the man.

At that moment Xie Li had already closed to five zhang, the murderous intent as solid as a blade cutting at Yang Kai's flesh.

In the next instant Xie Li's body flushed a strange blood-red; his qi flared and convulsed, becoming wildly chaotic. Blood poured from his eyes, nose, mouth and ears, his eyes bulging as if they would burst — a horrifying sight.

"This is…" Yang Kai watched the sudden scene in stunned suspicion, and then understood something. His face changed as he touched out and the Purple Shield shot forth, answering his call and forming a violent sandstorm that wrapped him.

At the same time the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird dove from the sky and with a cry transformed into a curtain of flame to block in front of Yang Kai.

No sooner had Yang Kai completed these defenses than Xie Li barreled into the flame curtain formed by the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

The scorching fire enveloped him, turning him into a human torch in an instant, yet Xie Li seemed oblivious and continued his reckless charge toward Yang Kai, chanting as he went, his expression savage.

The flame curtain contracted and impeded Xie Li's advance, slowing his momentum considerably.

Even so, Xie Li's body had nearly reached its limit: his skin cracked and blood seeped out, drying under the fierce heat.

A tremendous explosion tore out as Xie Li's flesh and the vast Saint Yuan within him suddenly ruptured. An unimaginable shockwave spread outward from where he stood, blasting sand and stone as if the world itself split.

The surrounding spatial light snapped and the illusionary formations set here could not withstand the impact; after only a few breaths they collapsed, revealing the terrain that should have been there.

The flame curtain that had wrapped Xie Li was likewise torn apart; the blast scattered and formless, but the Artifact Spirit had no true body — though twisted and condensed by the force, it suffered no fatal harm, its eyes revealing an almost human terror.

Dragon Lair Mountain shook at that moment; the soaring energy fluctuations could not be contained even by layers of protective arrays.

"Eh!" Fifty li away Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu both straightened in alarm and stared toward Dragon Lair Mountain with heavy concern.

"Old Fe, what's that…" Qian Tong's face turned solemn.

“Someone self-destructed?” Fei Zhi Tu exclaimed in surprise.

"Yes, and judging by that aura, it seems like Xie Li."

"Impossible. Xie Li is, after all, at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; even if trapped in a formation he shouldn't end up like this."

"Let's go take a look — something's off over there!" Qian Tong said, then flashed away toward Dragon Lair Mountain. Fei Zhi Tu frowned, forced a wry smile, and had no choice but to follow.

That said, Yingyue Hall was currently in a difficult position and it was better not to meddle. But after witnessing that Yang Kai possessed a lingering shard of an Ancient Divine Spirit, Fei Zhi Tu could not regard him the same as an ordinary Saint King Realm; he instinctively wanted to curry favor.

And with Qian Tong clearly favoring Yang Kai, he did not want to see Yang Kai suffer losses at Dragon Lair Mountain.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er exchanged a glance and without hesitation followed as well.

The four rose into the sky and sped away; before they reached Dragon Lair Mountain they saw in all directions countless lights rushing toward the same spot — evidently other experts who had been spectators.

Upon sensing the commotion within Dragon Lair Mountain, they were astonished and rushed over to take a look.

At Liuli Sect, Gong Aofu, accompanied by Daiyuan and Yin Sudie, also flew quickly toward the scene. Unlike Gong Aofu and Yin Sudie, Daiyuan's face was anxious; after hesitating she bit her lip and asked, "Master, what on earth happened? Why is there such a terrifying energy fluctuation?"

Gong Aofu's brows knit; she was displeased at Daiyuan's concern for Dragon Lair Mountain and at first refused to answer. Seeing Yin Sudie also looked puzzled, she thought a moment and said, "It seems someone self-destructed; otherwise there couldn't be such a commotion."

"Self-destructed? Who?" Yin Sudie lifted her brows excitedly. "Could Dragon Lair Mountain be outmatched and Yang Kai forced into a corner?"

Hearing this, Daiyuan's pretty face paled and her heart fluttered wildly.

Gong Aofu shook her head slowly. "No, that brat doesn't have the strength to cause such a disturbance. Whoever self-destructed must be of my level."

"Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm? Impossible!" Yin Sudie cried, "Only three people at the Second Stage entered Dragon Lair Mountain — each peerless and famed. Why would one choose to self-destruct?"

"How would I know? Didn't you see so many people hurrying there? They're probably going to investigate because they don't know. But judging by the aura… it bears some resemblance to that one from Yingyue Hall."

"Yingyue Hall… then wouldn't that be…" Yin Sudie's expression shifted.

"Master, is that really so?" Daiyuan's face filled with excitement.

Gong Aofu glanced at her coldly and snapped her back to reality: "Whether it is or isn't, what concern is it of yours? Once this matter is settled, you will return to Liuli Sect and seclude yourself. Do not venture out without my orders!"

"Yes…" Daiyuan bit her lip and obediently nodded.

Gong Aofu was pleased with her disciple's attitude, but doubts churned in her heart. What peril lay within this little Dragon Lair Mountain that could drive a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm to self-destruct?

Meanwhile inside Dragon Lair Mountain's Stone Residence, Yang Yan's face had changed drastically. Even hiding inside, she could clearly sense the violent energy fluctuations. Rocks were falling and Yang Kai stood nearly at the very center of danger — she did not know if he was dead or alive.

She hurriedly projected a thread of Saint Yuan into the golden-and-silver Formation Plate before her. Once she detected Yang Kai's aura she breathed a sigh of relief.

Yang Kai was not dead, only his aura was chaotic. As she prepared to examine him more closely, Wu Yi cried out from the side, "Sister Yang Yan, many experts are approaching Dragon Lair Mountain — what do we do?"

Yang Yan's beautiful eyes narrowed as she scanned the Formation Plate and indeed saw many points of light rapidly approaching, several too bright — reactions typical of warriors at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

A rough count showed at least a dozen, and that was not all.

So many?

Yang Yan's face darkened. With so many experts arriving, even if Yingyue Hall wanted to intervene they likely could not help. Qian Tong and Yang Kai were friendly, but they could not oppose so many; it would only pull him into trouble.

After a moment's thought Yang Yan's expression cooled and she commanded coldly, "Activate all the formation's restraints; kill any who dare trespass into Dragon Lair Mountain!"

Wu Yi was stunned for a moment, then nodded and, hands moving in a flurry, poured Saint Yuan into the Formation Plate. Soon a thicker mist shrouded Dragon Lair Mountain and an eerie stillness settled within.

"Qian Yue, take them to the vault." Yang Yan's voice carried a chill.

"Are we going to use that?" Qian Yue's eyes brightened when she heard this.

Yang Yan gave a wry smile. "I hope not, but it's better to prepare. You helped forge it back then; you know what to do now."

"I understand." Qian Yue nodded and immediately strode outside. In moments all the warriors hiding in the Stone Residence poured out and followed Qian Yue to a certain part of Dragon Lair Mountain.

"Xiaoxiao!" Yang Yan called softly, and a small creature resembling a stone puppet silently appeared before her, eerily still, its round eyes gazing at Yang Yan with curiosity.

"You go too!" Yang Yan waved; the Stone Puppet shimmered and vanished once more.
