## Chapter 2532 — The Girl in Red

“A guide?” Yang Kai was quite surprised. There were actually people who specialized in leading the way into the Ancient Land—now that was something new.

But when he thought of all the dangers in the Ancient Land’s passage, he quickly understood.

“Don’t underestimate Old Ban. His strength isn’t high, just the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and he’s already quite old. But in all of Desolate City, he’s the one who’s entered the Ancient Land and returned safely the most times. I’ve lived here for thirty years, and just from what I’ve heard, he’s done it about a hundred times. For others, even coming back three or five times is already an impressive feat. He’s the best guide in all of the Desolate City—no one can compare.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but be moved. He exclaimed, “How has he managed to go in and out so many times?”

Pi San gave a bitter smile. “I’d like to know that too, but Old Ban never shares his secret with anyone. Still, I suspect he’s found a safe route in and out.”

Yang Kai nodded. “Then I really must meet him. Do you know if Old Ban is in the Desolate City right now?”

It was best to be cautious. Though he was skilled and bold, having someone lead him safely into the Ancient Land was not a bad idea.

“He’s here. I saw him just yesterday. But if you want him to guide you, it’ll cost at least three hundred thousand Source Crystals.”

“Source Crystals aren’t a problem.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Three hundred thousand Source Crystals was nothing to him. Pi San had spent five hundred thousand just on this table of food and drink.

“Shall I take you over, Sir?” Pi San asked eagerly.

Yang Kai nodded, thought for a moment, then called over the restaurant’s attendant and asked her to bring ten more jars of the Barbaric Wild Wine to take away.

He didn’t need to drink it himself, but it would do Zhang Ruoxi good to have more.

Soon, the attendant brought over ten jars of Barbaric Wild Wine. But to Yang Kai’s surprise, before he could pay, the attendant smiled and said, “There’s no need to pay for these. My shopkeeper said these are a gift for you, Sir. Please accept them.”

“The shopkeeper?” Yang Kai frowned.

Pi San, on the other hand, looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, his face full of surprise.

“Why is your shopkeeper giving these to me?” Yang Kai asked the attendant.

The attendant shook her head. “I don’t know, Sir.”

Yang Kai frowned, waved his hand, and took out some Source Crystals from his Spatial Ring, leaving them on the table. Only then did he put the Barbaric Wild Wine into his Spatial Ring and call to Zhang Ruoxi and Pi San, “Let’s go!”

The attendant was momentarily stunned, not expecting someone to refuse a free gift. By the time she came to her senses, Yang Kai had already left the restaurant.

After leaving, Pi San hesitated several times before finally asking, “Sir, do you know the shopkeeper?”

“No, this is my first time here,” Yang Kai replied calmly.

“That’s strange. If you don’t know him, why would he give you ten jars of the Barbaric Wild Wine?”

Yang Kai chuckled. “No one gives something for nothing. If he’s being so attentive, he must have an ulterior motive. Anyway, what’s the background of this restaurant?”

Pi San said, “I’m not sure either. It’s been around for a long time, and the shopkeeper is always mysterious, never showing his face. No one in the Desolate City knows where this restaurant came from. But everyone guesses there’s a powerful force behind it—otherwise, it couldn’t survive here, let alone run such a luxurious place.”

Even someone as well-connected as Pi San didn’t know the restaurant’s origins. It seemed there really was a powerful force behind it.

Yang Kai refused the free wine because he didn’t want to get involved with the restaurant. Better not to owe anyone anything.

On the second floor of the restaurant, a pair of bright eyes watched Yang Kai leave. After a long while, a soft sigh sounded, then a voice said, “Send word to the Young Master—tell him the person he mentioned has arrived and will soon enter the Ancient Land. He should get ready.”

“Yes!” came a reply from the darkness.

…

Desolate City covered a large area. After walking for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai and the others arrived at a spot in the west of the city.

Pi San pointed from a distance at a stone house. “That’s Old Ban’s place. You can go on your own, Sir. Old Ban doesn’t like me much, so I’d better not go with you—he might take it out on you.”

Yang Kai nodded. “Thank you for your trouble.”

Pi San grinned. “You’re too kind, Sir. I wish you a safe journey and a swift return. I’ll take my leave!”

With that, Pi San darted away and quickly disappeared.

“Let’s go.” Yang Kai called out and headed straight for the stone house Pi San had pointed out.

The houses here had no beauty to speak of, but they were extremely sturdy—very much in line with the Desolate City’s style.

Soon, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi arrived in front of the stone house. It looked a bit like a farmhouse, with a stone wall around it and a large gate facing the center.

At that moment, the gate was wide open, and two martial artists in black stood guard just inside, one on each side.

When Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi approached, both men looked over coldly, their faces expressionless.

“Hm?” Yang Kai was a bit surprised. He thought he’d come to the wrong place. With guards at the door, it looked like someone important lived here. And both guards had the cultivation of the Dao Origin Realm, their auras deep and powerful.

But according to Pi San, Old Ban wasn’t anyone special—otherwise, he wouldn’t be making a living guiding people through the Ancient Land.

“What do you want?” one of the black-clad guards demanded.

“Excuse me, is this Old Ban’s residence?” Zhang Ruoxi asked.

“Don’t know,” the guard replied coldly.

Zhang Ruoxi frowned. “What do you mean, you don’t know? Why are you standing here, then?”

It wasn’t a hard question—yes or no would do. But the guard just said he didn’t know, acting all tight-lipped, which was infuriating.

The guard glanced at her and just gave a cold laugh, saying nothing more.

Zhang Ruoxi was furious.

Yang Kai glanced inside, then smiled slightly. “Looks like we’re in the right place, but it seems there’s someone here already.” He turned to the black-clad guards at the door and asked, “Is your Family Head inside?”

“You talk too much, friend. You’d better leave,” the guard on the right said coldly.

Yang Kai grinned. “Why?”

The guard on the left snorted. “Are you here to cause trouble? Didn’t you hear us tell you to leave?”

Yang Kai was surprised. “This is Old Ban’s place, isn’t it? What right do you have to tell people to leave?”

“Our young lady is inside. If you don’t want to die, get lost!”

Yang Kai was even more puzzled. He didn’t know which force these two belonged to, or who their young lady was, to be so arrogant in the Desolate City. This place was full of all sorts—if they offended the wrong person, it could be trouble.

But these two guards acted like they didn’t care about anyone, so they must have some powerful backing.

Still, Yang Kai had killed even those at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm and fought with Great Emperors. There weren’t many people in this world who could scare him. Looking at the two arrogant guards, he didn’t get angry. He just said calmly, “I have business with Old Ban. Please step aside.”

As he spoke, a strange light flashed in his eyes.

The two guards, who had been so overbearing, suddenly groaned as if struck by lightning. They staggered back a few steps, faces turning pale.

An overwhelming pressure made it hard for them to breathe, as if a mountain was pressing down on them. They couldn’t even move a finger, cold sweat pouring down their faces, forced to watch as Yang Kai led Zhang Ruoxi past them.

Zhang Ruoxi, still angry at their arrogance, shook her little fist at them as she passed.

Before Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi could enter the inner room, a sharp shout rang out, followed by the sound of something slicing through the air.

A sharp crack rang out, followed by a muffled groan—and at the same time, a child’s anguished wail echoed into Yang Kai’s ears.

Yang Kai’s expression changed and he rushed inside. He saw an old man with white hair curled up on the pitted ground, his aura weak—just the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and even that was unstable due to his age.

This must be the Old Ban Pi San had mentioned.

At that moment, he was turned sideways to the door, holding a little girl in his arms.

His shoulder bore a shocking bloody mark, as if he’d been whipped. His clothes were torn, and a large patch of skin and flesh was missing, blood streaming down.

The little girl in his arms was wailing, clearly terrified.

Besides the old man and the girl, there were two others in the room.

One was about fifty, with a stern face and an imposing air, watching coldly, completely indifferent.

The other was a girl in a fiery red dress, about the same age as Zhang Ruoxi. Her face was exquisitely beautiful, her figure full and curvy, the tight dress outlining every curve. With that red dress, she looked like a blooming rose.

But right now, the girl was holding a whip as thick as a thumb, raised high, her face fierce as she shouted, “Old thing, don’t be ungrateful! I’m giving you face by asking you to guide me. If you dare say no again, I’ll beat you to death!”

Clearly, the wound on the old man’s shoulder was from this girl’s whip, and the little girl had been frightened into tears by her.

“I’ll ask you again—are you going to guide me or not?” the girl demanded viciously.

The old man lowered his head, gritting his teeth. “Miss, could you give me a few days? Ling’er is sick and needs someone to care for her. If I leave, what will she do?”
