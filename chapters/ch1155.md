## Chapter 1155 — Big Wallet, Big Nerve

Once the auctioneer’s words fell, the hall erupted into a noisy commotion. In Room C-13, Qian Tong hurriedly cupped his fists toward Yang Kai and said, “Nephew, don’t be in a rush to leave after the auction ends. This old man still has something to discuss with you. For now, I must go fight for that Origin Condensing Pill—excuse me!”

Yang Kai didn't try to stop him; he only nodded and replied, "Elder Qian, please go ahead."

Qian Tong hurried off in a rush. The beautiful auctioneer raised her hand slightly, and once the noise in the hall subsided, she continued, “Everyone here should already know the effects of the Origin Condensing Pill — it can increase the chance for cultivators at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm to break through to the Origin Returning Realm. Our Dark Star is poor in resources and lacks any Void King Realm masters to oversee it. The Origin Returning Realm cultivators are our greatest foundation, yet each year, the number of new ones who succeed is pitifully small. The biggest reason for that is that very few can refine the Origin Condensing Pill. Although it’s classified as a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Pill, its difficulty of refinement is no less than that of an Origin-Grade Pill, with a success rate of less than thirty percent. For Jubao Tower to obtain even one took tremendous effort. Now, the auction begins — the starting price is one hundred thousand Saint Crystals, with each bid to increase by no less than two thousand!”

The beautiful woman’s words reached Yang Kai’s ears, leaving him dumbfounded.

The Origin Condensing Pill being auctioned was clearly one he had put up—and it was one of the two he had made. When had Jubao Tower ever "spent considerable effort" collecting it? That woman was brazenly lying. Still, besides a few who knew the truth, most of the hall had no idea where the pill came from; her words were meant to inflate its value.

One Origin Condensing Pill was effectively equal to an Origin Returning Realm expert; every faction present wanted it.

However, he had clearly sent over two Origin Condensing Pills, yet Jubao Tower had only put one up for auction. It was obvious they intended to make a grand show out of the second one — this first pill was merely a warm-up. He believed that even if people competed for it, they wouldn’t go too far.

Advancement for a cultivator doesn't rely solely on pills—the pills are an aid, not the sole path.

Yang Kai’s guess was soon proven right — the bidding for the Origin Condensing Pill turned out to be truly fierce, but none of the esteemed guests in the private rooms made a move. Instead, it was the cultivators on the main floor who competed heatedly, driving the price up from one hundred thousand to two hundred and eighty thousand Saint Crystals in no time.

The forces behind those cultivators were nowhere near as wealthy as the ones occupying the private rooms, and the number of Origin Returning Realm experts they possessed was pitifully small. To the great powers, an Origin Condensing Pill might not seem all that valuable — after all, it could only help nurture a single Origin Returning Realm master. But for the smaller forces, it was an entirely different story. Gaining even one more Origin Returning Realm cultivator could greatly elevate the standing of their sect or family.

Take the Haike Family and the Xu Family, for example—dozens at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, yet no Origin Returning experts. Give one of them an Origin Condensing Pill and they could finally escape the shackles of being an outsider faction, move into the inner ranks of Yingyue Hall, and enjoy different treatment.

That was why they were scrambling for this pill.

Once the price reached two hundred eighty thousand the bidding in the hall tapered off. Two hundred eighty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals was likely near many bidders' limit; no matter how much they desired it, they couldn't afford more.

“Bidder number three hundred twenty-one has offered two hundred eighty thousand — is there anyone willing to go higher?” the beautiful auctioneer called out sweetly once more, her enchanting eyes sweeping slowly over the room.

The man who had bid two hundred eighty thousand jumped to his feet in excitement, glancing around with a face full of nervous eagerness, afraid someone would outbid him. He shouted impatiently at the auctioneer, "Call the count, there's no higher bid—hurry up!"

The auctioneer, seeming all too obliging, smiled slightly and loudly announced, "Two hundred eighty thousand—going once..."

"Three hundred thousand!" A low voice from a private room cut her off.

The auctioneer froze, then looked towards that room. A flash of comprehension crossed her eyes and she waited silently.

The cultivator who had nearly secured the bid immediately sat down in dejection upon hearing that the voice calling out three hundred thousand came from one of the A-Class private rooms, his expression dim and his head hanging in defeat.

Never mind that someone else outbid him—the identity of the person in the A-Class private room alone made him unable to risk confrontation. That person had stayed silent until now; it seemed he had no intention of hobnobbing with the riffraff in the hall and planned to decide the matter only at the critical moment.

His tactic was clever: let the hall bidders reveal themselves, then strike decisively to show off his wealth.

Indeed, no one else in the hall dared bid.

The auctioneer parted her red lips to call the count once more; in her view three hundred thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals for an Origin Condensing Pill was about right.

But before she could speak, another bid arrived—and it was outrageously high.

"Four hundred thousand!" The new bidder announced the sum and chuckled, "For something as valuable as an Origin Condensing Pill, you should raise boldly—what's the use of adding a thousand or two?"

His words seemed to mock the A-Class private room bidder's earlier three-hundred-thousand offer, but no one took offense; the new bidder was also from an A-Class room, and his status clearly equalled or exceeded the previous bidder's.

On Dark Star, the great powers were not always amicable; there were open rivalries and mortal enmities. Smart observers suspected that the two A-Class private room bidders held grudges, or that their factions had conflicts—otherwise why would they attack each other so openly?

“Elder Qian…” Wu Yi gasped softly inside the C-13 private room. She had recognized the voice that called out four hundred thousand — it was actually Qian Tong’s! The old man had only just left moments ago, and now he was throwing around Saint Crystals like dirt. She couldn’t imagine where he got so many.

Yang Kai's expression turned strange. He frowned inwardly. What was Qian Tong playing at? He knew the Origin Condensing Pill came from him; why push the price so high? If Qian Tong accidentally bought it himself, he'd be at a loss—unless he truly wanted it.

If he was deliberately driving up the price, it would mean he intended to buy it back at a high cost to sell someone a favor — but that didn’t make sense. Qian Tong surely knew there was another, better Origin Condensing Pill still to come. There was no need for him to do this; if he really wanted to curry favor, he could simply raise the bids when the next pill appeared.

It seemed Qian Tong had some grudge with the earlier bidder, Yang Kai guessed silently.

“Hmph — four hundred and ten thousand!” The other man, as if deaf to Qian Tong’s sarcasm, snorted and raised the price by another ten thousand.

“Five hundred thousand!” Qian Tong’s bid exuded extravagance, his voice ringing with confidence. He raised in full, solid sums, drawing the gaze of many in the hall — plenty of whom quietly marveled at his wealth.

“Five hundred and ten thousand!”

“Six hundred thousand!”

"..."

The two men seemed to be matching each other's tempo. Only their alternating voices echoed in the auction hall as the Origin Condensing Pill's price soared. Yang Kai felt as if in a dream—he could hardly believe the pill he had casually refined would fetch such a sum.

He had previously asked Wu Yi which pills sold for high prices; she named Origin Condensing Pills and Void Ascension Pills. He couldn't refine Void Ascension Pills, so he had randomly made two Origin Condensing Pills. He'd been worried Yang Yan's two Origin-Grade treasures wouldn't fetch a high price, so he had done what he could—never dreaming a single Origin Condensing Pill would bring such contentment.

With six hundred thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals, he could buy a vast amount of precious materials — and with them, Yang Yan’s plan to set up an array covering the entire Dragon Lair Mountain would no longer be just a dream.

Moreover, Qian Tong and that man’s bidding still hadn’t stopped — in the blink of an eye, the price had already soared to seven hundred and ten thousand!

Sighs echoed from countless private rooms; everyone thought the two men had gone mad to push an Origin Condensing Pill so high. Even if they had mortal hatred, it shouldn't go this far—this set a precedent. If Origin Condensing Pills always sold this steeply from now on, what then? Only a fool would buy.

"So many Saint Crystals—rich people are terrifying," Wu Yi said with a bitter smile, thinking of how the Haike Family scraped by for thousands or tens of thousands, while here in Jubao Tower the wealthy flaunted fortunes with reckless abandon.

"Soon those Saint Crystals will be ours," Yang Kai inhaled.

"Why?" Wu Yi looked at him in stunned confusion.

"Because that Origin Condensing Pill is the one I put up for auction."

“What?” Wu Yi and Yang Yan exclaimed in unison, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief. Even the two young women from Yingyue Hall attending to them had their lips slightly parted — they clearly hadn’t expected the man they were serving to be so wealthy. Regardless of his background, with over seven hundred thousand Saint Crystals to his name, his status instantly rose to another level.

"Eight hundred thousand!" Qian Tong's voice continued calmly, as if he were saying eighty thousand or eight thousand—utterly unconcerned.

"Nine hundred thousand!" The rival snapped back, abandoning incremental tens of thousands and leaping up by a hundred thousand, hissing, "Old rascal Qian Tong, if you want a fight I'll oblige—but don't try to disgust me like this. A mere few hundred thousand Saint Crystals is nothing to my Sea Temple!”

"Hahaha!" Qian Tong laughed long and loud. "Jiang Huai'an, what do you mean by that? Is this your first time at a Jubao Tower auction? Don't you understand: in any auction the highest bid wins? I like this Origin Condensing Pill and can bid as I please. If you can't afford it don't compete with me—stop spouting nonsense. I may not have much else, but I have plenty of Saint Crystals. I just picked up several tens of millions, nowhere to spend it—if I don't buy what I like, what else can I do? Put it in a coffin?"

The private rooms burst into scornful sounds; the Sea Hall man named Jiang Huai'an was so enraged he looked near to vomiting blood.

Those Saint Crystals Qian Tong claimed to have “picked up” — nearly everyone in the private rooms had contributed to that pile, the Sea Temple included. Taking other people’s Saint Crystals to fight them over an item… the man practically had no shame. Qian Tong’s behavior was truly despicable.
