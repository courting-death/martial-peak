## Chapter 886 — Predicament

After absorbing that Long Shuttle Secret Treasure into his body, Yang Kai emerged from seclusion, glanced over the current state of the Sacred Land, and found everything apparently as before.

The Sacred Land’s disciples, after the last incident, had all thrown themselves into cultivation with renewed diligence, and the elders had also made considerable progress.

Under the restraint of Li Rong and the other leaders, the ancient demon clan’s people were likewise able to coexist peacefully with those of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The only thing causing concern was the shortage of cultivation supplies.

Although Wu Jie had sent a large amount of supplies last time, there are thousands of people in the Sacred Land and consumption is rapid; resources were stretched thin and would likely be exhausted before long.

Previously, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s cultivation supplies came from disciples foraging outside, tributes from three nearby powers, or the old Saint Lord traveling to the Yao Realm to trade crystal stones for provisions.

Now that crystal stone veins had been wantonly mined by the yao for two or three years, they were on the verge of depletion; there wasn’t enough even for their own use, let alone to trade for more supplies.

Yang Kai took out the things he didn’t need from the Black Book Space, but that could only ease the situation temporarily.

The elders of the Sacred Land wore worried faces every day, fretting over the future.

Seeing them like that, Yang Kai felt awkward asking them to help hunt down Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects; he simply could not bring himself to add to their burden.

Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects, regardless of grade, are all extraordinarily rare and priceless; at such a juncture, the Sacred Land had no spare resources to pursue them.

With no better plan, Yang Kai left the mess to Xu Hui and the others, and once more entered the Sacred Tomb to close himself off and cultivate.

Inside the Sacred Tomb he contemplated the Dao of heaven and martial path, seeking his way forward, and the days passed quickly.

When cultivation wearied him, Yang Kai refined pills to ease his body and mind.

His original reason for learning alchemy was only to cultivate his Divine Sense.

The True Alchemy Formula containing that vast, precious information lay in his mind; without activating Divine Sense he could not probe it.

But gradually, as he mastered more alchemical knowledge, he walked down that path himself.

He hadn’t expected to go far, yet he was already able to refine Saint-Grade Middle-Level pills—better than ninety-nine percent of alchemists on the continent.

The True Alchemy Formula played no small part in this achievement.

Yang Kai also discovered that researching alchemy greatly aided his martial progress and mental cultivation, and deepened his understanding of the Divine Sense Fire.

He decided to truly take alchemy as a side-branch of his martial comprehension.

So while raising his own realm, he spared no effort to improve his alchemical skill.

Unfortunately, since refining that Saint-Grade Middle-Level pill at Mogu Castle, Yang Kai had few Saint-Grade materials left.

At his current level, if he did not refine Saint-Grade pills he could not advance his alchemical attainments—he would be stuck forever.

After making a few Saint pills inside the Sacred Tomb, Saint-Grade herbs were completely exhausted, leaving him helpless.

Time is no obstacle to cultivation; when Yang Kai emerged from seclusion again, three months had already passed.

The scenery among the Nine Peaks had altered in subtle ways.

In the main hall the elders were holding a discussion. The atmosphere was grave; when Yang Kai drifted in they all stiffened, quickly rising to greet him.

"Sit, all of you. I just came out of seclusion and dropped by to take a look—no need to fuss over me," Yang Kai said, gesturing.

They nodded slightly and took their seats.

"Saint Lord, you’re just in time," Xu Hui said. "We’re discussing whether to sell off some of the Sacred Land’s unused valuables. Saint Lord, give us your opinion."

"Sell what?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Some unused Secret Treasures, and martial technique manuals that don’t belong to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land," Xu Hui answered.

"Why sell them?" Yang Kai scanned the room.

The elders blushed and looked at one another, mutely embarrassed.

Yang Kai grew even more puzzled.

Xu Hui smiled wryly. "Mainly because the disciples have been cultivating in the Sacred Tomb for some time, making many gains and breakthroughs. Consolidating their current cultivation consumed a lot; the Sacred Land’s Yuan Qi was badly damaged, so…we’re short on supplies. Selling those things could bring in a fair amount."

"Saint Lord, persuade the Great Elder—he’s even selling the Saint-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure the old Saint Lord gave him," Yu Ying said.

Yang Kai sprang a little. "The Sacred Land is in that dire a predicament?"

"It’s my incompetence!" Xu Hui said awkwardly. "But if we can get through this, things will improve in time."

"It’s not your fault," Yang Kai shook his head, then mused, "It has something to do with the demons I brought, right? Did you allocate a lot of resources to them?"

Xu Hui and the others had never told him that, but Yang Kai had observed it for himself.

Since the Ancient Demon Clan moved into the Sacred Land, their people have enjoyed plentiful supplies for cultivation—these must have been provided by Xu Hui.

The Sacred Land could be self-sufficient, but the Ancient Demon Clan could not.

They could not leave the Nine Peaks; if discovered it would cause trouble. Those extra thousand or so people were dragging the Sacred Land down.

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, Xu Hui did not deny it and merely nodded.

"This is my responsibility," Yang Kai inclined his head, taking the blame. "I overlooked this issue."

After a moment of thought, Yang Kai suddenly brightened and asked, "Great Elder, a question I perhaps shouldn’t ask: you elders who have reached the Saint Realm—have you all been collecting Saint-Grade materials?"

Xu Hui nodded. "Yes. Since entering the late Transcendent Realm I’ve deliberately gathered materials—some for pills, some for Secret Treasures…anything I need I set aside, and when the day comes I’ll find a suitable alchemist or artificer to help refine them."

"I’ve gathered some too," Cheng Yuetong nodded.

One by one the elders chimed in, each saying they had done the same.

Because collecting Saint-Grade materials is difficult and time-consuming, cultivators in the Transcendent Realm often do so with purpose over long periods.

"But the materials we collected have already been used up…Pity for Elder Yu Ying—she spent ten years gathering the ingredients for a Qingyun Pill, and they’ve all recently been consumed," Xu Hui sighed.

"Why bring that up?" Yu Ying pursed her lips and smiled. "Which one of you hasn’t taken out what you painstakingly collected?"

"We’re different…" Luo Sheng sighed. "Our collections are incomplete, but if you find an outstanding alchemist to refine them, with luck a single Qingyun Pill could be successfully made and greatly boost your strength."

"Indeed!"

"In front of the Saint Lord, let’s not speak of this," Yu Ying covered her mouth and laughed. "We sound like we’re begging."

The elders gave forced laughs.

"Saint Lord, why are you asking?" Xu Hui asked, puzzled.

Yang Kai’s eyes shone with divine light. "So—most cultivators above the Transcendent Realm habitually collect materials, and some fortunate ones have already gathered what they need."

"You could say that," Xu Hui nodded, not understanding what it had to do with the Sacred Land’s situation. After a pause he continued, "But even if they’ve collected them, finding someone to refine them is troublesome. Elder Yu Ying delayed for so long because she couldn’t find the right person. Good alchemists and artificers are hard to find and there’s always the risk of failure."

"That’s fine," Yang Kai chuckled. "I have a way to ease the Sacred Land’s current predicament…"

The elders immediately brightened and looked at Yang Kai with excited eyes, their hearts stirred.

"Elder Yu Ying, I’ll repay you with a Qingyun Pill one day!" Yang Kai said with a smile.

Yu Ying’s expression trembled; her beautiful eyes filled with expectation.

Yang Kai suddenly rose and announced loudly, "Great Elder, use every contact the Sacred Land has to spread word externally that our Sacred Land can refine pills. Anyone who needs a Spirit-Grade upper-level or above pill, come to the Sacred Land! However, make clear that we cannot refine Saint-Grade upper-level pills. The price for successful pills will be equal to the pill’s value—only crystal stones and herbs accepted. If refinement fails, our Sacred Land will compensate in full!"

In the hall, the elders gaped at Yang Kai, speechless, not knowing what stunt their Saint Lord was up to today.

Seeing no reaction from Xu Hui, Yang Kai frowned slightly. "Is the requested payment a bit high?"

Xu Hui finally came to himself and forced a smile. "If you can guarantee success, that price isn’t high at all! Many people expend immense effort collecting materials. After one or two failures, they grow weary and reluctant, so demanding payment equal to the pill’s value in crystal stones or herbs isn’t excessive—it’s actually easy for people to accept."

"Then why the ghostly looks?" Yang Kai swept his gaze across them.

"Saint Lord…" Xu Hui’s face twitched. "Our Sacred Land doesn’t have a Saint-Grade alchemist…"

Xu Hui even suspected Yang Kai had gone senile in seclusion and forgotten such basic facts.

Although the Nine Heavens Sacred Land is formidable on the continent, it still lacked a resident Saint-Grade alchemist.

Such figures are rare, and the Alchemists' Association generally doesn’t allow them to serve a single faction exclusively.

Only if a faction cultivates such a talent itself would they be free from the Association’s control.

Sadly, after so many years the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had produced no Saint-Grade alchemists.

"Not having one before doesn’t mean we don’t have one now—spread the message exactly as I said!" Yang Kai said with a mysterious smile.

Xu Hui trembled and suddenly seemed to recall something. "Saint Lord means that among those demons…"

But he quickly frowned; demons cannot refine pills because of the Demon Yuan in their bodies.

"Who refines them is none of your concern—just do as I said."

"Yes!" Seeing Yang Kai so confident, Xu Hui stopped questioning and immediately set to arranging matters with the other elders.

Although the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had few people come to its aid during the last crisis and was now engulfed in a tide of accusations about colluding with demons and yao, that did nothing to hinder the spread of the news.

Over the years the elders cultivated their own social connections and began to use them to disseminate the news.
