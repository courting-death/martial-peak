## Chapter 1856 — Are You Well?

Although everyone had long known that the Second Young Master and the Great Elder were at odds, they had usually put on a show of civility when they met; yet over the past year their relationship seemed only to have hardened into open hostility.

The reason was simple: the Great Elder was the maternal grandfather of the Young Master Zi Donglai, and his daughter Gongsun Yu was Zi Donglai's birth mother; with that blood tie, Gongsun Liang naturally spared no effort in backing Zi Donglai to rise, patiently waiting for the day he would become the master of Purple Star.

Zi Wuji’s mother, on the other hand, had only come from a minor family within Purple Star — utterly incomparable to Zi Donglai’s lineage.

Thus Gongsun Liang had always looked down on Zi Wuji.

Ever since two years ago, when Zi Long and Zi Donglai left Purple Star together and had not yet returned, Purple Star had descended into a scramble for power and profit, a violent tide surging through its ranks.

Especially in the past year, Zi Wuji had been working behind the scenes, gathering many experts to his side, while Gongsun Liang also constantly schemed; the clashes between the two camps could hardly be concealed any longer.

Their moves had split the Purple Star strong into three clear factions: one pledged allegiance to Zi Wuji and was willing to serve him; another was led by Gongsun Liang, who took advantage of the absence of the domain master and the Young Master to act openly — his intentions obvious; the rest watched and waited, unmoved by either side, preferring to wait for Zi Long's return.

Since the two were covert rivals, Gongsun Liang certainly would not deign to acknowledge Zi Wuji.

Zi Wuji frowned, a trace of displeasure crossing his face — after all, he was Purple Star's Second Young Master, and Gongsun Liang's open contempt in front of so many experts made him lose face.

"Gongsun Liang — how dare you!" Ji Jun, who stood behind Zi Wuji, suddenly thundered, "The Second Young Master asks you a question; why do you refuse to answer?"

A savage light flashed across Gongsun Liang's eyes as he coldly looked down at Ji Jun, half‑closing his eyes. "Who is being insolent? I am the Great Elder of Purple Star. With the lord absent from the palace, I oversee all affairs here. What are you to me, that you dare shout at me?"

Ji Jun sneered coldly. "Gongsun Liang, don't think we don't know what scheme you have in mind. When the tiger is away, the monkey claims kingship. Wait until the lord returns — let's see how arrogant you can remain."

"Who are you calling a monkey?" Gongsun Liang had rarely been treated with such insult; anger burned within him as he glared at Ji Jun.

"You know perfectly well," Ji Jun replied with a continuous snort.

"Courting death!" Gongsun Liang exploded in fury. Saint Yuan surged wildly around him, as if he were about to strike at Ji Jun the next moment.

Everyone's faces changed drastically.

"Great Elder, calm yourself!" Zi Wuji suddenly stepped forward, interposing himself before Ji Jun and slightly cupping his fist toward the air. "Elder Ji is blunt of tongue; if he has offended, Wuji apologizes on his behalf. I hope the Great Elder will not make a fuss."

"Hmph." Gongsun Liang snorted, saying nothing.

Zi Wuji let out a short laugh. "Now is not the time for internal strife. For the moment, we must think about finding the intruder who broke into the Purple Star palace. No one knows what their intent was — if they came with ill will, that would be troublesome. Great Elder, what do you say?"

Gongsun Liang knew as well that this was no time to clash. A Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert had suddenly appeared in the palace, irritating him; he no longer said more.

Zi Wuji continued, "Father is absent, Eldest Brother follows Father in attendance, the Purple Star palace has no leader. Though I wish to help relieve my father's burden, my strength is insufficient and I fear I am incapable. Since the Great Elder oversees all palace matters, I must trouble the Great Elder to handle finding that thief and tear them limb from limb as a warning, otherwise what face will Purple Star have left!"

Gongsun Liang's brow tightened and he said in a deep voice, "This matter needs no further words from the Second Young Master. I will handle it properly. You may return."

"Wuji withdraws!" Zi Wuji inclined his head with a smile and, with Ji Jun, left composedly.

After they departed, Gongsun Liang barked, "Search everywhere for that person. Leave no clue unexamined — that one definitely did not go far, only hiding their aura with some secret art. If you find them, do not fight them alone; send a message to me and I will arrive at once!"

"Yes!" the others replied in unison and then scattered.

For a time the Purple Star palace was in an uproar as experts swept through every corner, mighty Divine Senses combing the palace's nooks and crannies...

"Second Young Master, why are you so lenient with that old curmudgeon?" On the way back, Ji Jun asked with an unhidden expression.

Zi Wuji's face showed a cold smile as he snorted lightly, "Now is not the time to tear open old wounds; let that old man be arrogant for a while."

Ji Jun frowned but, hearing this, did not argue further.

"However... that intruder did me a great favor this time." Zi Wuji smiled faintly. "Whoever that person is, I must give them my thanks."

Ji Jun frowned and thought for a moment. "Second Young Master, you mean he distracted that old curmudgeon for you?"

"That is only part of it." Zi Wuji smiled. "The intruder is strong — able to trade a move with Gongsun Liang and leave calmly — surely a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert. Gongsun Liang will not easily find him. Think about it, Elder Ji: if he cannot find that person, where will Gongsun Liang put his face?"

"Indeed!" Ji Jun's eyes lit with delight. "If they cannot find that person, the old curmudgeon's face will be ruined. Hahaha — no wonder the Second Young Master was eager to withdraw earlier; so that's the reason!"

"Do you think I am so easily swayed? Although troublesome, handling this properly would be an opportunity to accumulate prestige." Zi Wuji tapped his temple with a finger. "But... who could dare break into my Purple Star palace? Second Stage of the Void King Realm experts are rare in this Star Domain, each a renowned figure — they would never stoop to petty sneaking."

For some reason, Yang Kai's figure flashed through Zi Wuji's mind as he said that.

Yang Kai, the Third Venerable of Purple Star, had only recently appeared in Purple Star City; with such trouble tonight in the palace, it was natural he would be drawn to Yang Kai's name.

"Could it be him?" Zi Wuji could not be certain, and a thick suspicion lingered between his brows.

In one of the palace halls, Yang Kai lay in hiding, suppressing his aura completely and silently feeling the palace's mobilization of arms with a look of helplessness.

Since he had already alerted the snake in the grass, this trip was effectively wasted — and now he couldn’t leave even if he wanted to. With so many Void King Realm experts sweeping the area with their Divine Senses, any slight movement on his part would be noticed instantly.

So he could only endure and wait for a better chance.

Time passed slowly. Yang Kai was not anxious; experts came and went over his head without discovering his presence.

Gradually, a figure landed not far off, glanced about, then walked straight toward a wing chamber.

Before the wing chamber stood several Origin Returning Realm experts on guard. Seeing the newcomer, they saluted, "We pay our respects to Seventh Elder!"

"Mm." The Seventh Elder nodded gently and asked, "Is there anything unusual inside?"

"Seventh Elder, nothing abnormal," the leading Origin Returning Realm replied respectfully, then asked with suspicion, "Seventh Elder, what happened earlier? I thought I heard signs of a fight."

"Someone intruded into the Purple Star palace. The Great Elder fears they entered to target those inside, so he sent me to take a look. Open the warding."

"Yes." The men did not hesitate; each took from their spatial rings a flag‑like secret treasure, poured Saint Yuan into them, and struck the surrounding void. In the next moment, a ripple rose and the room's ward opened.

The Seventh Elder stepped inside and, after a moment, shouts and cursing were heard from within.

But the sounds were quickly silenced — apparently the people within had been thrashed by the Seventh Elder.

The Seventh Elder strode out from within, annoyance written across his face. He coldly snorted, “Overestimating yourselves — you actually dared to raise a hand against me. If you didn’t still have some use, I’d have taken your lives on the spot. Keep your eyes open: if even one of these people goes missing, your heads will be missing from your shoulders!”

The Origin Returning experts stiffened and answered in turn.

With a step, the Seventh Elder turned into a streak of light and shot into the sky, vanishing in an instant.

After he left, the Origin Returning Realm men exchanged glances and, faces grave, began forming hand seals to reseal the ward.

Yang Kai, hidden nearby, watched the chamber with an odd expression, suspicion written across his face.

In those curses and shouts just now, he thought he had heard a familiar voice!

That made him reluctant to believe it.

Hesitating only a moment, Yang Kai resolved to act; while the ward was still open he moved and slipped inside the room.

The men opening the ward frowned — in that instant they had felt a brief unease which quickly faded, leaving them baffled.

They assumed they had been mistaken and paid it little mind, then formed their seals again to reopen the ward.

Yang Kai appeared leisurely in the room.

Before he could take in the scene, two figures suddenly lunged, attempting to strike him.

Yang Kai's face darkened as the Void King Realm domain field erupted forth, freezing the surrounding space completely. He deliberately kept the field small, covering only the room so as not to trigger the outside ward.

"Shh..." Yang Kai held a finger to his lips in warning.

Only then did he see clearly inside the room.

There were five people inside, all with Origin Returning Realm strength. The strongest was only Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Four looked unfamiliar, but one youth appeared strikingly familiar to Yang Kai.

At that moment the youth hung suspended in midair by Yang Kai's domain field, a flicker of doubt in his eyes as he stared hard at Yang Kai. In the next instant his eyes widened, turning blank and stunned; trembling, he pointed at Yang Kai and stammered, "You..."

Yang Kai grinned broadly. "Brother Shen Tu, life certainly has a way of bringing people together — are you well?"
