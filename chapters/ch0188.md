## Chapter 188 — Resistance and Breakthrough

The last remaining piece of snow-white undergarment was also torn apart, leaving Yu Aoqing completely bare.

Amid her cries for mercy, Yang Kai tugged at his clothes, quickly tearing off his upper garment, low growls of suppressed emotions escaping his throat.

The proud daughter of Yunxia had lost the strength to resist, slowly closing her eyes, ceasing her cries and pleas, allowing tears to slide down the corners of her eyes.

Perhaps Miao Lin was right.

With death imminent, what was the point of preserving her purity? Although this youth appeared violent and evil, he was still far better than the scum that was Miao Lin.

A sharp pain surged in her chest, a result of being squeezed, and Yu Aoqing could not help but let out a soft whimper.

Just as she thought her purity was doomed to be tarnished, the reckless youth atop her suddenly halted.

Yu Aoqing slightly opened her eyes, only to see him still staring at her with those bloodshot eyes, filled with lust, greed, and possession. Yet, occasionally, a flicker of struggle and resistance crossed his gaze.

The hot breath escaping his nostrils was enough to melt gold and sever iron. His brows were tightly knitted, his face contorted in pain, as if he were enduring something.

Suddenly, a terrifying energy erupted from the youth, making him appear even more sinister.

With the eruption of this energy, his strength surged at an unbelievable speed.

Qi Movement Fourth Layer, Fifth Layer… Eighth Layer, Ninth Layer…

The fluctuations of energy from the Separation and Union Realm!

He broke through to the second layer of the Separation and Union Realm before gradually stabilizing.

As his strength increased, the madness in his eyes intensified, but the struggle against it also grew fiercer.

Suddenly, he crawled off her, directly sitting cross-legged on the ground, gritting his teeth and growling, “Stay away from me! Or bear the consequences!”

Yu Aoqing, who thought she was doomed, was momentarily stunned, feeling as if she had been granted a reprieve. With great difficulty, she used her remaining arm to pick up a piece of clothing and drape it over her flawless body. She curled up her uninjured leg and slowly edged to the corner, watching Yang Kai with terror, her delicate body trembling.

Yang Kai was very clear-headed!

From beginning to end, his consciousness remained alert, including the moment he lunged at Yu Aoqing, tore her clothes, and ravaged her body.

But this instinctual impulse, stimulated by Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian, had reached its peak and was utterly uncontrollable.

While indulging in the desire buried deep within his bones, Yang Kai also fought against its influence over him.

In the end, he had no choice but to activate the Proud Bone Golden Body, barely suppressing it.

It was only at this moment that Yang Kai understood how difficult it was to resist the desire Su Yan had spoken of. If the woman alone with him had not been Yu Aoqing, but Su Yan was nearby, even if it meant walking through fire and over blades, Yang Kai would have sought her out to indulge in that desire.

The blood and energy in his chest surged violently, every piece of flesh and every cell in his body cried out, yearning for the soft comfort of a woman.

The unstable energy roiled, causing the entire stone cave to moan and howl, disturbing the giant insects that peeked in curiously.

His bare upper body was blood-red, a sight that was extremely frightening.

Yet, not far from him was a defenseless beauty, completely naked. If he wished, he could possess her at any time and savor the delightful pleasure. This was undoubtedly another test for Yang Kai at this moment.

He struggled not to think of her, even forcibly erasing Su Yan’s figure from his mind. Yang Kai immersed himself in his own body, continuously operating the True Yang Technique, endlessly feeling the mysteries of the Proud Bone Golden Body, distracting his attention.

Last time, he had gleaned the essence of the Unyielding Will from the Proud Bone Golden Body, but Yang Kai knew that there were still hidden secrets within this golden body. His current strength and comprehension were insufficient to uncover them.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Yang Kai once again delved deeply into it.

He did not seek to comprehend the mysteries of the Proud Bone Golden Body; he only wished to stabilize his raging instincts.

The effect was fairly good. Although the situation had not eased, it had at least stabilized.

Yu Aoqing, recognizing the situation, understood that Yang Kai was desperately resisting his desires and naturally dared not make any noise, fearing to attract his attention. She merely curled up there, motionless.

As time passed, Yang Kai’s condition gradually improved, his violent emotions slowly calming, and the surging energy within him began to show signs of restraint.

It was unclear how long had passed, but once Yang Kai’s fury dissipated, the cave returned to silence.

Taking a deep breath, he opened his eyes. The strength temporarily boosted by the Proud Bone Golden Body also began to fade, and his realm fell.

Separation and Union First Layer… Qi Movement Ninth Layer, Eighth Layer… Fifth Layer!

He stabilized.

This time, successfully resisting the desires within him unexpectedly elevated his strength by a layer. Although this was an unexpected gain, Yang Kai’s expression remained calm and unperturbed.

He furrowed his brows slightly, sitting there motionless, lost in thought.

This time, while contemplating the mysteries of the Proud Bone Golden Body, although he had not gained what he had hoped for, it was not without progress. In that vague sense, Yang Kai felt a layer of restraint blocking his path. As long as he could break through this layer, another secret of the Proud Bone Golden Body would reveal itself.

Unfortunately, his current strength and understanding of martial arts were still too lacking to break this layer of restraint.

He could only wait for another opportunity to comprehend it.

Letting out a long sigh, Yang Kai turned to look around, and his gaze fell upon Yu Aoqing in the corner, staring at him.

In her beautiful eyes, there was fear, but also a hint of resentment and hatred. Any woman who had experienced what she had would find it hard to remain calm.

Yang Kai stood up and walked toward her step by step.

“Don’t come over!” Yu Aoqing shouted, her voice fierce yet trembling as she retreated. But with the cave wall behind her, there was nowhere left to escape.

Yang Kai wore a mysterious smile as he approached her and slowly crouched down in front of her.

“Get away!” Yu Aoqing, unable to move her hands, unexpectedly charged at Yang Kai with all her might. Yang Kai did not move, allowing her head to collide with his forehead.

With a thud, Yu Aoqing stumbled, her smooth forehead immediately turning red.

Yang Kai reached out a hand, grasping her dislocated arm, pulling it down and then lifting it up. With a crisp crack, Yu Aoqing let out a cry, the pain causing her to break out in a cold sweat, instinctively slapping her palm toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai countered with a palm, neutralizing her attack, and coldly said, “If you want to die, I can kill you right now!”

His icy tone and gaze froze Yu Aoqing in place, and she finally realized that her dislocated arm had been set back into place.

Ignoring her murderous glare, Yang Kai reached out again, rubbing her thigh, channeling energy to resolve the hidden injuries there.

A warm sensation spread, making Yu Aoqing feel somewhat intolerable.

After treating her injured arm and thigh, Yang Kai slowly stood up and sat down beside her.

Yu Aoqing looked at him in disbelief, unable to comprehend why this youth would treat her so kindly. Just a short while ago, he had used domineering means to ravage her body, attempting to possess her.

They had no relationship, and in fact, had enmity. Why was he doing this?

Unable to understand, Yu Aoqing gritted her teeth, secretly observing Yang Kai while she quietly put on her clothes.

Hearing the commotion, Yang Kai naturally knew what she was doing. He didn’t need to open his eyes to know that the scene was undoubtedly alluring and enticing. Yet, unexpectedly, he found himself having little reaction. Upon reflection, perhaps it was the desire that had accumulated over the past few months that had all been released during his earlier resistance, allowing him to remain so calm.

This was indeed a good method for cultivating the mind: to accumulate desire for a period, then find a way to resist it. Once successful in resisting, both strength and mental state could be improved.

Unintentionally, Yang Kai discovered a cultivation path suitable for himself.

The cave fell silent once more, with Yang Kai and Yu Aoqing sitting at opposite ends, one patiently waiting and the other anxiously restless, neither speaking a word.

About a day later, a sudden commotion came from outside; those giant insects were coming to capture people again.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted, and he opened his eyes, while Yu Aoqing was filled with dread, fearing she would meet the same fate as her fellow disciples.

Just as she was worried, she saw Yang Kai stand up and walk toward the exit.

He did not intend to save Yu Aoqing out of kindness; this woman was malicious and certainly not a virtuous person. Even if Yang Kai had not done anything to her before, he would not spare her life even if they had been intimate.

He had reattached her arm earlier as a matter of courtesy, after all, this breakthrough had been aided by her. Letting her go meant they were even, and neither owed the other anything.

Yang Kai now took the initiative to step out primarily to find the Insect King. To leave this cursed place, he had to find the Insect King.

Based on what he had seen in the past few days and his own experiences, Yang Kai was certain that these strange insects had captured him and others for the Insect King’s enjoyment.

Perhaps seeing that Yang Kai was sensible, those giant insects were not as cruel as they had been with Miao Lin and Luo Qianqian. Instead, one led the way while several others pushed and shoved Yang Kai from behind, urging him to move faster.

Yu Aoqing stared blankly at all this, a smirk of satisfaction appearing at the corners of her mouth, only to burst into tears again. Naturally, she wished for Yang Kai’s death, but if he truly died, she would be left all alone and miserable. Comparatively, she preferred Yang Kai to survive.

The winding insect tunnel seemed to stretch on forever, and after an unknown amount of time, Yang Kai finally arrived at an enormous cavern.

The giant insects drove Yang Kai into the cave but did not follow him inside.

“Earth Demon!” Yang Kai vigilantly surveyed his surroundings while calling out in his heart.

To his surprise, the Earth Demon, who had always responded to his call, did not react this time.

Yang Kai was taken aback, thinking something had happened to him. He quickly checked and couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time.

The old demon had somehow sealed his own Divine Sense.

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai asked as he released the seal.

“Has the Young Master finished?” the Earth Demon grinned.

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai frowned.
