## Chapter 1250 — Blood Fusion Pill

In the Flowing Flame Sandland's First Layer's Heat-Flame Zone, Yang Kai strode outward; a faint azure glow blossomed at his chest, dispelling the surrounding threats. The heat waves and fire poison of the Heat-Flame Zone could not penetrate it in the slightest, and Yang Kai remained untroubled even without invoking his Saint Yuan protective body.

More than half a year had passed since the Flowing Flame Sandland closed, and throughout that time Yang Kai had lingered on the Sixth Layer.

It wasn't that he was searching for some treasure — the valuable things in the pavilion had already been taken by him; there was nothing left to scavenge.

He remained there only to cut a few stalks of green bamboo.

He had intended to chop a few and leave, but the toughness of those bamboos far exceeded his expectations. Even using the Space Blade constantly, it took him a full twenty days to bring down a single stalk as thick as a thumb.

During those twenty days, the repeated use of the Space Blade unexpectedly deepened Yang Kai's understanding of it, and the Space Blade he unleashed became markedly more powerful.

Overjoyed, he no longer minded the time spent.

For the next half year Yang Kai stayed in that bamboo grove, sparring with stalk after stalk. After so long he had only felled twenty bamboos; if not for the delay weighing on him and fearing Yang Yan and Wu Yi would worry, he wouldn't have come out so early.

A month ago he set off in haste, and it took him a month to reach the First Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

During that time he had kept the two Star Emperor Tokens on his person at all times, not daring to relax. Once the Flowing Flame Sandland shut completely, the myriad dangers within had indeed grown countless times fiercer. The treasure zones on the Second and Fourth Stages were comparatively better, but the Heat-Flame Zones on the Third and Fifth Stages had amplified their heat power by more than tenfold.

Yang Kai figured that even his Cold Flame would be unable to withstand such scorching heat; fortunately the Star Emperor Tokens shielded him, removing his worries and allowing him to travel unharmed.

He did not know why the Star Emperor Token could counter the Heat-Flame Zone's environment, but he vaguely suspected that this Flowing Flame Sandland had some connection to the legendary Starry Sky Emperor; otherwise a second, already-used Star Emperor Token would not have appeared on the pavilion's third layer.

Anyone entering at such a time would be certain to die; no wonder cultivators on the Dark Star had to choose to enter when the Flowing Flame Sandland's power had weakened — only then was it relatively safe.

Ahead of him, not far off, a thin film-like dark-red energy shield hung in the air, containing horrifying heat; anyone who approached would be melted into a pool of blood in an instant.

Yet when Yang Kai saw that film-like dark-red shield, he showed not the slightest fear; instead his face brightened and he strode straight toward it, as though courting death.

The moment his body contacted the dark-red shield, it seemed to sense something and autonomously split open a seam, allowing Yang Kai to pass through with ease.

After he slipped through, it resealed itself and returned to its former state.

Once through the dark-red barrier the scene before him changed. Although the burning aura still lingered and the ground underfoot was cracked and parched, in the distance there was scenery unlike any Heat-Flame Zone.

He had finally come out. The Flowing Flame Sandland was truly vast; even with the Wind-and-Thunder Wings in constant use he had still flown for a month to get from the innermost reaches to the outside.

Yang Kai estimated the Flowing Flame Sandland covered at least several hundred thousand li. No one had known before simply because no one had ever penetrated to the Third Layer and beyond, so no one could gauge its scale.

As soon as he stepped out, Yang Kai placed the two Star Emperor Tokens he had kept close to his chest into Black Book Space for safekeeping.

Yet the next moment he was in some embarrassment, for he did not know his precise location. The Yuan Magnetic Pointer had given him a bearing when he exited, but it only pointed toward the center of the Flowing Flame Sandland; if he walked opposite to the pointer he could leave the sandland.

Now, however, he could not determine where he was.

At least he was still on the Dark Star, which slightly eased Yang Kai's mind. He was about to release his Divine Sense to probe the vicinity when he frowned and glanced to the side.

Not far off a figure was hurtling toward him. When their eyes met the man displayed extreme astonishment.

After all, more than half a year had passed since the Flowing Flame Sandland closed and sects large and small had withdrawn long ago; he had not expected to run into a living person here.

Yet the man gave a soft exclamation, as if he recognized Yang Kai's face.

Yang Kai was utterly speechless.

The other had recognized him — and he, of course, had recognized the other.

Although he did not know the man's name, Yang Kai had indeed met him once before, when the Flowing Flame Sandland first opened and Yang Kai had just entered — that very cultivator had once invited him to cooperate.

At that time, two people had been transported near Yang Kai — one from Yingyue Hall, and the other was this very cultivator.

Back then Yang Kai had refused the invitation without hesitation.

The instant the man saw Yang Kai he showed a flash of delight, then turned and charged straight toward Yang Kai. Before he could get close his expression changed and he abruptly halted.

Another figure swiftly passed him and intercepted before him.

Immediately a silhouette appeared behind him as well, forming a pincer and trapping him in the center.

The man’s face darkened; he glanced at Yang Kai as if to say something but withheld his words.

The two who had blocked him secretly probed Yang Kai with their Divine Sense and, seeing he was only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, did not take him too seriously.

One of the tall, burly cultivators let out a sinister chuckle and looked maliciously at the person blocking their path. He said, “Junior Brother Deng, I was wondering why you hurried all the way to the outskirts of the Flowing Flame Sandland — so you had a helper lying in wait here. What, you think a Second-Stage Saint King cultivator can take on the two of us?”

The man in the purple robe sneered derisively: “Looks like Junior Brother Deng has lately been favored and grown foolish, otherwise why would he come to a place like this? Senior Brother Ye, there’s no need to lower yourself to his level.”

Deng Ning, trapped in the middle, scowled; he neither defended himself nor conceded. He said in a low voice, “Ye Yangrong, An Zhiyong, for the sake of a mere Blood Fusion Pill, you two would really go so far as to cut me off completely, disregarding all the brotherly ties we once had?”

The towering cultivator called Ye Yangrong sneered: “Brotherhood? In the Demon Blood Sect such a thing is a luxury. As a Senior Brother I do not expect it. As for the Blood Fusion Pill… Junior Brother Deng, if you know what’s good for you you’ll hand it over obediently. We are of the same lineage; I don’t wish to be excessively ruthless.”

Deng Ning gave a coarse laugh and mocked: “You don’t want that? Are you afraid I’ll lash out as I die? Don’t think the two of you have me firmly in your grasp. Even if I die, I can still take one of you with me.”

Upon hearing that, Ye Yangrong and An Zhiyong’s expressions both changed, showing a trace of apprehension; it was clear they knew Deng Ning’s words were not empty threats.

An Zhiyong frowned and reined in some of his killing intent, then earnestly tried to persuade him: “Junior Brother Deng, the last time you were in the Flowing Flame Sandland you obtained many fine things. It’s precisely because of that harvest the elders rewarded you with a Blood Fusion Pill, and as far as I know they didn’t stop at the pill — the sect’s secret manuals have been opened to you and you were even bestowed a powerful Secret Treasure. Why make trouble over a single pill? We only want that pill. If you must have compensation, Senior Brother Ye and I will each give you thirty thousand Saint Crystals.”

He assumed that offering Deng Ning an exit would make him relent, for it was hardly worth dying over one pill. Deng Ning instead burst into cold laughter: “Thirty thousand? As members of the Demon Blood Sect, don’t you understand how precious the Blood Fusion Pill is? Do you think thirty thousand will make up my losses? Don’t be ridiculous.”

An Zhiyong’s face chilled as he prepared to reply, but Deng Ning mocked on: “But, Senior Brother An, don’t blame your Junior Brother for not warning you — you know Senior Brother Ye’s character better than anyone. There’s only one Blood Fusion Pill; even if I handed it to you, how would you split it? Don’t expect Senior Brother Ye to give it up — I suspect your end won’t be any better than mine.”

At these words An Zhiyong’s expression flickered; he knew exactly where Deng Ning was coming from, but now found himself trapped between options and could only join forces with Ye Yangrong to seize the Blood Fusion Pill first.

How they would divide it afterwards was another matter.

Seeing An Zhiyong’s hesitation, Ye Yangrong quickly snapped, “Junior Brother An, do not be swayed by his sowing of discord. If the two of us work together, whoever snatches the Blood Fusion Pill from him shall keep it. If Senior Brother happens to prevail and obtain the divine pill, Senior Brother promises to give you proper compensation.”

Hearing that, An Zhiyong’s face cleared a little and he forced a smile: “If this Junior Brother is lucky enough to get it, I will follow the same course as Senior Brother.”

Both harbored ulterior motives, but for the time being they had reached an agreement.

Seeing his scheme had failed, Deng Ning’s expression turned grim. He swept his hand across his Spatial Ring and produced a single blood-red pill from it, a pill pulsing with startling blood qi.

“Blood Fusion Pill!” At the sight of the pill both Ye Yangrong and An Zhiyong revealed covetous, greedy looks, staring fixedly at the pill as if it were the greatest treasure.
