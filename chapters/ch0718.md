## Chapter 718 — Transcendent Realm

In this catastrophe, aside from his bones remaining intact, every other part of Yang Kai's body had suffered damage to varying degrees.

The Great Demon God's bones were even more resilient than a Saint-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure; amid the ravages of that starry sky storm, they had not been harmed in the slightest.

This fact made Yang Kai exceedingly relieved.

Piece by piece the flesh and strip by strip the sinews were covered by a faint golden radiance; the injured internal organs glowed with a pearly gold light, vitality within surged, the flesh gradually filled out and reclothed the bones.

The medicinal effect of the Wan Yao Ling Milk continued to operate, coupled with the Demon God's Blood — a two-pronged effort.

Lying in the void, Yang Kai thought of nothing; he relaxed body and mind and let the Demon God's Blood do its work, remolding his veins and flesh and repairing his body.

To an outsider, Yang Kai would appear shrouded in a faint golden light; from within that glow vigorous life slowly emanated, his lost life force and Qi and blood increasing at a subtle, steady pace.

The exhaustion and pain that had filled him, under the influence of the Demon God's Blood, gradually faded away, and his strength recovered considerably.

It was impossible to know how much time had passed; Yang Kai's eyes gradually brightened, and at that moment he felt an indescribable energy newly present within his body.

It was the starry sky force that had earlier been drawn into him by the starry storm.

From the broken flesh innumerable starry sky forces surged in; after an initial period of chaotic clashing they gradually settled, seeming quite pleased with Yang Kai's present body, taking up residence within and ceasing their rampage, instead becoming his capital.

Those starry sky forces harbored manifold mysteries and wonders; with a thought his acupoints all began to revolve, swallowing those starry sky forces clean.

Yet the secrets of the starry sky force remained unfathomably profound, waiting for him to comprehend and to grasp.

Not daring to be negligent, he held his breath and silenced his thoughts; Yang Kai's mind sank into his body.

An invisible gate seemed to slowly open before his eyes; Yang Kai stepped into a novel world he had never seen.

For no reason he could name, he could not help but feel he stood atop the clouds, looking down upon the myriad mortals below.

In that instant he felt himself lifted beyond the mortal plane, arriving at another realm.

The writhing flesh expelled impurities he had never perceived before; his corporeal form grew purer and stronger. As the flesh's impurities were cast out, an invisible barrier was being slowly destroyed. Yang Kai seemed to see himself taking great strides, crossing a chasm on the road to the Martial Peak!

The sensation grew ever clearer and more distinct; he became rapt, lingering and intoxicated within that state, and his state of mind soared rapidly.

In the boundless starry sky Yang Kai lay in quiet, lost in that wondrous domain, cultivating an understanding of the Heavenly Way of martial arts and the sublimation of his soul.

His body was likewise slowly restoring, undergoing a mysterious tempering during the recovery.

Both soul and body benefited together; surviving the disaster of the starry storm had granted him benefits of unimaginable magnitude.

With his body mending and his soul stabilized, Yang Kai soon forgot the existence of time.

In that moment he also forgot he was in the starry sky and received no disturbances from anyone.

One day Yang Kai's eyes suddenly flashed with a sharp brilliance, revealing insight; as he perceived his change his flesh writhed and every bone crackled.

The miraculous energies drifting through the starry sky seemed drawn by an invisible pull, and in an instant all surged into Yang Kai's body.

Having endured the baptism of the starry storm, these starry sky forces could no longer harm Yang Kai; once they entered his body they instead became his powerful asset.

An invisible aura spread outward, growing ever stronger, like a small storm rapidly forming with Yang Kai at its center.

Exhilarated, his body and mind received tremendous encouragement; every inch of flesh conveyed joy; Yang Kai tilted his head and howled to the heavens, venting his overwhelming excitement.

A ring of light suddenly burst outward from his body, exploding and spreading in every direction.

Immediately thereafter, everything calmed.

Yang Kai stood quietly where he was, feeling power gush forth from within; he lightly clenched his fist, as if he truly could pluck stars and summon the moon, overturn rivers and seas — his bodily strength more vigorous than ever before.

Transcendent Realm!

The moment his body finished repairing, Yang Kai had successfully reached the Transcendent Realm; from this point on he had truly transcended the mortal tier.

Yang Kai could clearly perceive that this realm differed greatly from the Divine Roaming Realm.

Both his body and soul had made substantial progress, and his combat prowess had soared crazily.

If he were to fight Xu Qi and Duan Hai of the Leiguang Divine Cult now, Yang Kai felt confident he could take them both at once and beat them senseless — no longer would he need, as before, to rely on the power of the Wind Eye to slay them.

The ascent to a major realm is fraught with toil and hardship, yet once achieved it brings fundamental change; this is true for any martial artist, which is why they relentlessly pursue ascension in level and cultivation.

Calming his excitement, Yang Kai inspected his body.

He was astonished to find not a single scar remained; the broken flesh had fully regrown, and compared to his previous body it was far, far more formidable.

Moreover, he could sense that the blood running through him differed greatly from before — about one third of his blood seemed to harbor destructive might.

That could only be the Demon God's Blood.

Additionally, the power of the Indomitable Golden Body had been awakened; in future this skeleton would continuously generate Demon God's Blood, replacing Yang Kai's original blood, and it would not be long before his entire bloodline had taken on a vibrant golden hue.

When that time came, his strength would leap further.

He closed his eyes and examined himself silently; gradually a grin spread across his face, his laughter small at first, swelling until it became unrestrained and hearty, echoing loudly through the starry sky and carrying for a great distance.

The journey through the starry sky had been monotonous and dull, yet Yang Kai felt it had not been in vain.

He had reaped vast benefits from the starry sky.

That sort of storm was likely rare and difficult to encounter again; attempting to temper himself through it once more seemed unrealistic — it was time to return!

Resolute, Yang Kai drew a light breath, scanned his surroundings, and suddenly noticed some peculiar points of light nearby faintly emitting glow.

He hurried over to investigate.

These stones turned out to be extremely precious ores of superb quality.

Yang Kai's expression grew odd; after a moment's thought he instantly understood these ores must be remnants left behind from the meteorite sea that had been shattered by the starry storm.

In that meteorite sea there had been hundreds to thousands of meteorites, large and small; within them certainly lay rare minerals — when the outer rock was pulverized these inner minerals were preserved, and those that could withstand the Baptism of the starry storm were of the highest caliber.

At the very least they were Saint-Grade Middle-Level minerals!

If these ores were used to forge a Secret Treasure, they ought to be capable of producing a Saint-Grade Secret Treasure, provided one had an exceptionally skilled armorer.

Yang Kai hastily collected these minerals; his Bone Shield had been shattered earlier, and with these ores he might one day have an armorer craft a Secret Treasure for him.

His haul was ample — over a hundred pieces of minerals large and small — none of which he could recognize, leaving him somewhat embarrassed.

But these were after all products of the starry sky; not recognizing them was understandable.

He stuffed them all into the Black Book Space, and his regret over the damaged Bone Shield was somewhat assuaged.

After determining a direction, Yang Kai set out to search for the way back.

He did not know exactly how long he had remained in the starry sky, but it had certainly been lengthy; just the body's repair had consumed at least two to three months.

Two to three months of comprehension had enabled him to successfully ascend to the Transcendent Realm; the hardships involved could be imagined.

Having been gone so long, his senior uncles and aunts would undoubtedly be anxious.

Time drifted by, and just as Yang Kai feared he might be lost, he finally discovered a bud-laden, dripping green flower.

The Thousand-Year Demon Flower!

It was not blooming then, but had reverted to bud form and floated in the void.

Finding it steadied Yang Kai's heart; he and Zhai Yao had appeared near here before, and according to Elder Li, the Void Passage to the Tongxuan Continent must be not far away.

Using this Thousand-Year Demon Flower as the center and radiating outward, Yang Kai scoured the area several times and finally located that Void Passage.

There was no sign of Zhai Yao nearby; he must have returned long ago.

They had earlier agreed not to hinder one another — when each felt ready they could return on their own. Given how much time had passed, he likely was no longer in the starry sky.

Yang Kai did not hesitate and dove in headfirst.

After experiencing the familiar dizziness, his vision cleared; around him birds sang and flowers perfumed the air, all green and fresh — he must be in a mountain forest.

Yang Kai scratched his head, somewhat uncertain where exactly he was.

He released his Divine Sense, and soon he smiled.

Some dozen li away, fluctuations of life arrived — there were evidently people active there.

Expanding his movement he sped toward them; before long Yang Kai reached that group.

A glance made his expression strange; he found those people quite interesting.

They were undoubtedly human, but paired two by two — a man and a woman in each pair — three pairs in total, each at the standard of the Divine Roaming Realm, their strength neither high nor low.

At that moment they were battling a ferocious Demonic Beast.

From their combat methods and the flow of True Yuan, those men and women must be hearts-and-minds united — in other words, twin-cultivation pairs.

Two people paired together could exert power beyond their own cultivation.
