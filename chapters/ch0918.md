## Chapter 918 — Wu Jie Visits

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang are both Saint-Grade Middle-Level alchemists, yet the time and resources each has devoted to alchemy are completely different.

For the past ten years Xia Ningshang has followed Meng Wuya everywhere, rarely enjoying steady days to focus on improving her alchemy, and Shopkeeper Meng couldn't gather alchemical materials as easily as Yang Kai could, constantly spending what he has on helping her practice.

In short, Yang Kai’s rise in alchemy to its current level has been built entirely on time and a massive accumulation of resources.

Little Senior Sister, by contrast, is uniquely gifted with an unusual constitution; the time she spends on alchemy and the spiritual herbs and medicines she consumes may only be a fraction of what Yang Kai used.

Yet both have arrived at the same Saint-Grade Middle-Level proficiency in alchemy.

When compared side by side, the difference is obvious.

Shocked as he was, Yang Kai was also full of joy; the more powerful his Little Senior Sister became, the happier he felt.

Unlike other men who fear their beloved surpassing them in some field, Yang Kai instead felt a stronger sense of achievement.

“Don’t worry. From now on you’ll have plenty of herbs here to practice with. I believe your alchemy will improve quickly; soon you’ll reach Elder Li’s level!” Yang Kai grinned and tapped, producing a globe of pure white light that drifted toward Xia Ningshang’s Spirit Body. “This contains all the knowledge of the True Alchemy Formula. Spend some time meditating on it, Little Senior Sister.”

“I understand.” Xia Ningshang opened her heart and mind, merging the light carrying the True Alchemy Formula into her Spirit Body and immediately began to comprehend it.

Yang Kai didn’t disturb her. He slipped away quietly.

Leaving his room, Yang Kai strolled into the main hall of the Saint Lord’s estate.

An Ling’er was poring over the accounts, apparently tallying the Sacred Land’s recent gains, her pretty face aglow with delight.

Yang Kai’s arrival didn’t rouse her. She continued to bury herself in her work, constantly recording details.

Only when Yang Kai sat opposite her and poured himself a cup of water did An Ling’er glance up and smile. “What’s this? Long time no see — aren’t you going to spend some time together? Two days isn’t much; why are you coming out already?”

Yang Kai reddened a little. “Everything that needed saying was said. What more is there?”

“Just talking?” An Ling’er pursed her lips.

“What do you think we were doing in there?” Yang Kai noticed her odd expression and guessed she had strange thoughts running through her head.

“Who knows? A man and a woman alone together — perfectly normal.” An Ling’er, in good spirits, teased him.

“You’re not jealous, are you?” Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

An Ling’er scoffed. “Don’t flatter yourself. The elders all assume we’re in that kind of relationship, but don’t take it seriously.”

“A Saintess daring to talk back to the Saint Lord — you might be the first.” Yang Kai chuckled.

“You’re the one who’s different from the previous Saint Lord; you gave up that opportunity. Enough joking around. These are the Sacred Land’s recent earnings — want to take a look?”

“Let me see.” Yang Kai casually picked up the ledger before her. Scanning it, he saw detailed entries for which master in the Sacred Land refined which pill on which day and what rewards they received — everything recorded without omission.

Most of the rewards were equivalent Crystal Stones, but there were many rare materials, even Secret Treasures, secret manuals, and cultivation techniques of every kind.

Yang Kai’s head swam; he tossed the ledger back. “Never mind, you keep the records.”

Sending his divine sense to sweep the Saint Lord’s estate, Yang Kai asked in surprise, “Where’s Shopkeeper Meng? Why isn’t he here?”

An Ling’er only then remembered. “If you hadn’t mentioned it I might have forgotten. That elder Meng said he’d be gone for a while and asked you to look after his disciple. He also warned that if anyone bullied his disciple, you’d be in for it.”

“He’s gone? When did he leave and did he say when he’ll be back?”

“He left yesterday. He didn’t say when he’d return.” An Ling’er shook her head.

Yang Kai frowned. Although he didn’t know why Meng Wuya had left so soon after arriving at the Sacred Land, he suspected something unusual, likely related to that strange world they had entered before, and perhaps connected to what the Great Demon God’s Soul Incarnation had said.

But Meng Wuya’s strength has now returned to its peak. As long as he doesn’t go back to the Demon Capital to challenge the Demon Lord as before, he should be safe.

While he was lost in thought, Xu Hui rushed in hurriedly and announced, “Saint Lord, Wu Jie requests an audience!”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “Wu Jie?”

“He seems to have encountered something; his expression was off.” Xu Hui reported.

“Bring him in.” Yang Kai hurriedly ordered.

They hadn’t seen Wu Jie for months, but from Xu Hui’s and others’ reports, after absorbing much talent from Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall, Wu Jie’s Netherworld Sect had grown considerably stronger and was on a steady rise.

A pale, ghostlike figure in a black robe — Wu Jie — appeared and cupped his fist. “Saint Lord!”

“Sect Master Wu.” Yang Kai inclined his head slightly. “Has something happened?”

Wu Jie nodded and said gravely, “Yes. It concerns the stone forest near Poxuan Palace.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed. “What’s wrong with that stone forest?”

“If it’s convenient for you, Saint Lord, follow me and you’ll see.” Wu Jie didn’t elaborate.

From his demeanor Yang Kai discerned a hint of seriousness and, without more words, nodded and strode out of the Saint Lord’s estate.

He sent a spirit-message for Li Rong to follow, and the three of them flew toward Poxuan Palace at speed.

“Master, did something happen?” Li Rong asked, bewildered.

“Wu Jie said that stone forest has a problem and wants me to take a look.”

“The stone forest?” Li Rong arched a delicate brow. “The one that leads to the starry sky?”

“Yes.”

“What’s wrong with it?”

“I don’t know.” Yang Kai shook his head.

After an incense stick’s worth of time the three arrived above the stone forest where they had last stood, and Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he looked down.

At the very center of the forest a pitch-black, ominous entrance had silently opened — just like the situation at the Sacred Tomb.

Li Rong covered her mouth in shock. “Who opened the entrance to the starry sky?”

Wu Jie shook his head. “My disciples discovered it unintentionally. Knowing this place is important to the Saint Lord, I ordered my disciples not to enter Poxuan Palace since we last parted. But yesterday, while a few disciples were flying nearby, they noticed the situation below. Curious, some of them went down to investigate and never returned. The remaining disciples rushed back and told me what happened, so I hurried to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.”

After hearing his account Yang Kai nodded faintly. “You should be glad you didn’t go down to investigate yourself.”

Wu Jie smiled. “I have self-awareness — so it really is an entrance to the starry sky?”

“Yes. Li Rong and I went in once to investigate. It truly leads to the legendary starry sky. Without a Third Stage of the Saint Realm body, one would certainly die inside. Your disciples likely won’t come back.”

Wu Jie’s face changed. “Only by reaching the Third Stage of the Saint Realm can one enter?”

“The starry sky exerts a terrifying pressure. Only the physical strength of someone at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm can withstand it.” Li Rong nodded beside him.

Wu Jie broke out in a cold sweat, feeling a pang of fear.

Quietly relieved, he was glad he’d warned Yang Kai immediately and not rashly entered himself. At his current level he might have suffered the same fate as those disciples.

“But… who opened the entrance?” Li Rong muttered, puzzled.

“Perhaps it opened on its own.” Yang Kai pondered.

“Opened on its own?” Li Rong and Wu Jie looked at him in surprise.

“There’s also a Small Xuan Realm within the Sacred Land called the Sacred Tomb, a resting place for past Saint Lords. Not long ago that realm’s entrance opened on its own, startling the elders; they still can’t close it.” Yang Kai explained offhandedly, his unease growing.

The Sacred Tomb’s entrance opened, and the entrance to the starry sky opened too — all in the last few days, coinciding with the day he brought Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang back.

Could it truly have anything to do with that strange world?

The distance between the two seemed too vast; how could they be related?

“Saint Lord, what should be done here? Should we station guards to watch it?”

“No. Go back and warn your Netherworld Sect disciples not to rush in. I’m not joking — without a Third Stage of the Saint Realm body, going in is a one-way trip.”

“I firmly believe the Saint Lord.” Wu Jie replied earnestly.

“I’ll tell the Sacred Land’s disciples to avoid this place. As for outsiders… if they want to go in, let them — their lives are their own.” Yang Kai snorted. “That’s that. Go back for now.”

“Then I’ll take my leave. I mainly came to inform the Saint Lord of this matter.” Wu Jie bowed and left.

“Go on as you please. By the way, if you need any Saint Pills made, come to the Sacred Land and ask me. I’ll prioritize making them for you.” Yang Kai reminded him.

Hearing this Wu Jie was overjoyed and thanked him repeatedly, promising to return soon with materials to request pills.

He had long wanted to seek pills from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, but because of his decent relationship with Yang Kai he’d felt embarrassed to visit at such a delicate moment and risk gossip that might tarnish the Sacred Land’s reputation.

Since Yang Kai had offered, Wu Jie had no excuse to refuse and left excitedly to prepare.

After seeing Wu Jie off, Yang Kai and Li Rong flew toward the Sacred Land in silence. Yang Kai’s mind churned as he recalled what the Great Demon God’s Soul Incarnation had said in that eerie world, searching for any thread or clue that might prove useful.
