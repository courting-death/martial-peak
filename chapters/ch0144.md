## Chapter 144 — The Might of the Mark of the Stars

Lan Chudie’s eyes sparkled with a unique brilliance as she gazed at Yang Kai.

She had sustained some injuries during the battle with the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast, and her once pristine clothing was now stained red with her own blood. Her chest rose and fell violently as she looked at the calm and composed figures of the man and woman standing beneath the raised forelimb of the beast, her heart surging with emotions.

The image of that figure, who had rushed forward without hesitation to rescue Su Yan, left a profound mark in the hearts of every woman who witnessed it.

Lan Chudie was no exception.

If there was a man willing to sacrifice his life for her, what did it matter if his strength was slightly lower? Sometimes, a woman’s desires were immense, yet at other times, they were trivial—so trivial that a mere unintentional word or action could open her heart, allowing his image and appearance to remain etched within.

How blissful it would be if she were the one standing beneath that beast!

But as she recalled her previous attitude towards him, a hint of sorrow flashed in Lan Chudie’s eyes, and she couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

“Do you still have the strength to fight?” Yang Kai asked Su Yan, looking over at her.

“Not anymore,” Su Yan slowly shook her head. “We need to leave quickly. This demon beast has a very tenacious life force. I can only freeze it for half a cup of tea’s time. If we don’t leave now, it will be too late.”

“Where shall we go?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “It was chasing Jie Hongchen before, but now it will likely come after you. Unless you leave this place, there’s no way to escape.”

“Then I will leave. I cannot let the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion suffer because of me.”

“It’s not your fault; why must you bear such a burden?” Yang Kai frowned, his tone slightly harsh. “You’re taking on too much as a senior sister.”

Su Yan looked at Yang Kai in surprise.

Is he scolding me? How dare he scold me? Even the elders of the sect have never reprimanded me. Yet, Su Yan felt no anger, nor did she have any thoughts of rebuttal.

“Look at the current state of the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion,” Yang Kai turned to glance at the many disciples who were panting heavily, with more of them sitting cross-legged on the ground, trying to recover. “Even if you leave, can you guarantee that this demon beast will spare them? Without you, they will only die faster!”

“What do you suggest we do?” Su Yan countered.

“Kill it!” Yang Kai grinned, though the smile strained against his injuries, causing cold sweat to bead on his forehead.

“Kill it?” Su Yan was taken aback; she hadn’t expected Yang Kai to have such grand ambitions.

In the face of such a demon beast, being able to escape was already remarkable; how could they possibly kill it?

As they spoke, a sudden noise came from the ice blocks surrounding the demon beast. Su Yan’s expression changed, “Why is it moving so quickly?”

“There’s no time!” Yang Kai was decisive, waving his hand at Su Yan. “Step back! No matter what, we have to give it a try. If we truly can’t kill it, we can still run away!”

Crack! Crack! The sound of the ice breaking grew louder, and the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast, trapped within, slowly turned its crimson eyes downward, staring at Yang Kai and Su Yan, who appeared as insignificant as ants in its gaze.

“Get back!” Yang Kai shouted when he saw Su Yan hadn’t moved.

Su Yan’s body trembled, and for some inexplicable reason, she complied and stepped back quickly.

The injured disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion also retreated.

Yang Kai positioned himself firmly in front of the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast, his slightly emaciated figure appearing like a giant standing against the heavens and the earth.

He stood there, blocking the beast’s might, shielding everyone from its massive form, and protecting them from the storm.

His right hand slowly began to move, a deliberate and measured motion that broke the visual perception of everyone present. Though nothing was in his hand, it seemed as if he wielded a colossal hammer, exerting all his strength to swing it.

Crack! Crack! The sound of bones dislocating echoed from that direction.

At the same time, a surge of overwhelming energy erupted from where Yang Kai stood, a terrifying aura that sent a howling wind through the air, causing his robe to flutter wildly, and his long hair to dance.

Yang Kai’s roar erupted, as he poured every ounce of his strength into his voice, shouting, “Disciples of the Three Sects…”

His right hand finally lifted, clenched into a fist, accompanied by his furious shout.

Brilliant light radiated from his position, transforming it into a beautiful starry sky. As the starlight swirled, his right fist moved back inch by inch, each movement amplifying the pressure, as if he were gathering power.

“If there are those with heart…” Yang Kai’s eyes blazed with intensity, struggling to control the energy erupting from his fist, refusing to let it burst forth, still enunciating each word clearly.

“What kind of martial technique is this!” Fang Ziqi’s expression changed drastically. Even from hundreds of zhang away, he could sense the immense lethality contained within that punch.

Moreover, this was merely the buildup of power, not the actual strike.

If such power could be felt during the buildup, how terrifying would it be when it was unleashed?

“How beautiful…” Hu Mei’er and Hu Jiao’er exclaimed in unison, captivated by the starry sky, as if they were lost in its enchanting beauty amidst the chaos.

With a loud crack, the ground beneath Yang Kai could no longer withstand the ferocity and split open, causing him to sink slightly, and his legs to bend.

The Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast, which was rapidly breaking free from its icy prison, no longer displayed resentment or murderous intent in its crimson eyes; only growing panic and fear remained.

It wanted to flee! It could sense the terrifying force behind Yang Kai’s punch. It had been sealed for countless years and was currently in a weakened state. It had just awakened from its seal and had not yet savored the joy of freedom; it did not want to be injured or fall back into that endless slumber.

But the massive ice block bound its movements.

“Can you assist me…” Yang Kai spoke for the third time. His words were barely complete, as controlling the energy in his right fist consumed all his focus. He could only let out fragmented roars to convey his intent.

As he shouted half of his sentence, Yang Kai suddenly pushed off the ground, propelling himself rapidly into the air, carrying that ethereal starry sky with him.

The starlight shone brightly, vast and boundless, exuding an overwhelming aura.

After soaring ten zhang high, Yang Kai’s ascent halted, and he turned around, head down, plummeting towards the position of the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast’s head.

At that moment, the ice sealing the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast finally shattered with a resounding crash.

“Roar!” As it broke free, the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast let out a furious roar that shook the heavens.

“One arm’s strength!” Yang Kai’s shout mingled with the beast’s roar, yet it clearly reached everyone’s ears.

In the next instant, that starry fist shot out rapidly, a transformation from extreme slowness to extreme speed, creating an intense visual conflict.

With a single punch, it struck above the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast’s head.

It was as if a muffled thunderclap rang out from the sky, or a violent tremor erupted from deep within the earth. When that minuscule fist struck the beast’s head, every heart present trembled, as if that punch could extinguish their very souls.

A visible, immense halo suddenly erupted from the point of contact between the fist and the demon beast’s head, rapidly spreading outward.

An unbelievable scene unfolded: the enormous Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast staggered under that punch, its hind legs lifted off the ground, while its forelimbs bent downward, its head crashing to the ground like a falling meteor, creating a deep pit and sending dust flying.

Yang Kai, too, was propelled upward by the force of the impact, tumbling through the air several times before landing unsteadily. At that moment, his right fist was a bloody mess, his entire arm drenched in blood, trembling uncontrollably. Yet he stood resolutely, gazing defiantly at the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast, which was now many times larger than him, emanating a fierce and wild aura.

The crowd was stunned, their eyes wide with disbelief.

No one had expected Yang Kai to truly be able to strike the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast like this, especially since it was an opponent even Su Yan had no way to deal with.

Yet now, that earth-shattering punch had indeed accomplished what they had never dared to imagine.

What kind of punch was that…

In retrospect, all they could think of was the breathtaking starry sky, the beauty intertwined with boundless killing intent, yet they could never quite grasp the trajectory of that punch.

As they gazed at the slender figure standing before the massive beast, Su Yan’s heart raced violently.

She knew that from this day forth, she would never forget that figure, for its owner had achieved what she could not.

Hu Mei’er’s cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkling as she looked at Yang Kai. Influenced by her sister's emotions, Hu Jiao’er’s heart raced as well.

What should I do? Hu Jiao’er felt lost inside. Her current emotions were not her own; they were merely a reaction to her sister’s feelings, which frightened her.

Lan Chudie was equally moved, but soon a bitter sensation spread within her heart, and her beautiful face revealed a hint of melancholy.

It could be said that this figure had already left an imprint in the hearts of many women. It represented safety and reliability! This was the kind of figure every woman yearned for.

“Remarkable!” Fang Ziqi felt a stir in his heart, accompanied by a slight sense of defeat. “I never knew there were such martial techniques in this world! Moreover, someone can actually wield them. Today, I have truly gained insight.”

“Why, why…” Jie Hongchen murmured as if lost, “Why isn’t this martial technique mine? Why haven’t I encountered such a fortuitous encounter? If I had, then the one drawing everyone’s attention, making all the women’s hearts flutter, would be me! Why is it him? He’s just luckier!”

“Is there no one to help? It’s not dead yet; if no one helps, everyone should prepare to run!” Yang Kai’s voice rang out once more.

Hearing this, the crowd finally snapped back to reality from their shock.

Su Yan immediately shouted, “Those who can still fight, go help!”
