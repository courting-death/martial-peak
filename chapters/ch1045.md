## Chapter 1045 — Struggle and Resistance

A great pit yawned a hundred zhang from where Yang Kai stood; inside it stood a woman of delicate, graceful figure, snow-white skin, and utterly unclothed.

She stood in the hollow, rubbing her forehead with slender fingers, kneading it slowly as she looked about in a daze.

Like Yang Kai had been moments ago, she was muddled by that calamity, still not fully understanding what had occurred.

She stood there with her alabaster body shining with a porcelain-like luster; twin peaks at her chest rose like mountains, full and surprisingly springy; her legs were long, fair and soft, and the exquisite place between them would set any man's blood racing.

Streaks of crimson blood ran over her body, lending her an exotic, almost perversely enticing allure.

Pain wracked her entire body; even the slightest movement brought forth suppressed moans from her throat, like the most bewitching notes rippling through the air.

As she rubbed her forehead she slowly realized her situation and recalled what had happened; her beautiful eyes shrank, and deep within her pupils a knife‑cold murderous intent gleamed, her delicate body trembling.

Gritting her teeth, she drew a deep breath; her full breasts rocked in an intoxicating arc as she steadied herself.

Then she brushed her Spatial Ring, took out a fragrant Pill, and placed it into her mouth to restore her injuries and strength.

She then took from the Spatial Ring a snow‑white undergarment, delicate and charming, scarcely larger than a palm; it was made of some unknown material and carved with many exquisite openwork patterns.

She lifted her foot and bent slightly, preparing to pull the garment on.

At that moment, a sudden clatter came from above as a fragmented stone slid loose and fell.

Hearing the sound, her face changed color. She snapped her head up to look.

She saw a man standing on the rim of the pit, staring at her with wide eyes; his gaze seemed to flare with divine light, sharp and unrestrained, roaming shamelessly over every private, hidden part of her, drinking it in with ravenous intent.

Her memory instantly returned; she recognized the man's face.

He was the one who had passed through the valley nearby some days ago, forcing her to abandon that transaction.

He was the one for whom she had spent two months searching, and for whom she had slain two thousand people!

He was the one who fled with her when the warship had been shattered.

The man stood there completely naked, every muscle bared and strong. His virility was displayed brazenly, like an elephant's trunk defiling her pure eyes and piercing her flawless heart!

Then she realized she too was unclothed, bent at the waist, breasts trembling and legs slightly raised—exposing herself like a wanton trying to please her lover, actively revealing every delight.

Shame and rage surged through her.

"You—" she cried out, but her voice faltered; her face paled as she began to cough violently, scarlet blood bubbling at the corner of her delicate mouth. With a small hand she pressed at her chest and staggered a few steps.

Her injuries were far worse than Yang Kai's. Her internal organs had all been displaced; although the crimson armor's earlier protection left no obvious open wounds, the hidden injuries were the deadly ones.

"…Die!" she forced out through difficulty, then glared at Yang Kai with hatred, teeth bared as if she would rip him apart alive.

No man had ever seen her body before; aside from a few most intimate people, no one knew this secret of hers. Yet now a small player who had sprung from some crack in the stone had seen her naked all over, his insolent gaze laced with a tone of appraisal.

She felt as if she had been desecrated.

"Young Master Xue Yue?" Yang Kai grinned, his smile full of meaning. He showed no concern for his own nakedness and instead stepped forward to make his shape clearer, clicking his tongue in wonder: "I never expected that Young Master Xue Yue would actually be a woman—what an astonishing revelation."

The woman in the pit shared seven or eight parts resemblance to the Xue Yue he had seen before, but myriad subtle differences transformed the male Xue Yue into a breathtaking beauty.

Her beauty was hard to describe; both face and body were flawless, as if the Creator had concentrated every virtue into her alone; every feature ensnared the heart and mind, intoxicating and impossible to resist.

Her eyes were crystal clear, shimmering like glass with a strange miasma swirling within, as if they could suck a person's spirit into them, leaving one unable to break free and eager to serve her with everything.

When Yang Kai first approached and saw her, his body couldn't help but quake; a deep intoxication rose in him, wishing to freeze time and space so he could forever watch this woman bending to dress.

She was like a dream—the most beautiful dream—and those lost in it would never wish to awaken.

Yang Kai had met many women throughout his journeys, countless with outstanding beauty, yet upon careful comparison, not a single one could reach her level. None were as flawless as she. To be fair, even Su Yan and his Little Senior Sister lacked something when compared to her.

To produce such a person was nothing short of a miracle!

She was a gift from the Creator.

She must have, like him, been knocked unconscious by that disaster and then dragged here by the dead star's gravity, only recently revived—otherwise she would have had time to put on clothing.

She had killed two thousand people only to search for his existence and to guard that one secret.

Whether Yang Kai wished it or not, he had already become her enemy.

Yet at this moment Yang Kai hesitated, uncertain whether to strike first to protect his position and interests.

After all, this person was kin to Shen Tu—she was Shen Tu's elder sister!

Moreover, Yang Kai felt somewhat reluctant to strike so beautiful a woman; he secretly thought it would be wrong to bully such an alluring figure.

That thought put him on guard, and he hurriedly steadied his mind, refusing to be swayed by Xue Yue.

Xue Yue had not used any charm technique or deliberately cast any secret art to affect his judgment; she merely stood there, looking at him with hatred and none of her disgust or killing intent concealed, yet that invisible pressure softened Yang Kai's heart.

"What a terrifying woman!" Yang Kai thought, startled.

Knowing she bore murderous intent toward him and would kill him if given the chance, he still found himself unable to act at once; he had never before encountered such a woman.

"What do you intend?" Xue Yue seemed aware of her poor state. She didn't rush to trouble Yang Kai; instead, a seven‑colored light burst from within her, veiling her and shielding her private parts from exposure, denying Yang Kai the chance to peek.

Perhaps because she was too weak, that seven‑colored radiance was not very dense; it hung over her like a translucent veil.

Suddenly she became even more alluring!

That hazy beauty struck Yang Kai's heart with overwhelming force, giving him an immensely violent visual shock.

It made him more excited than when she had been completely naked.

Xue Yue's face grew increasingly sullen and ashamed; her pent‑up fury and grievance finally exploded. She waved her slender hand and a seven‑colored light like satin shot at Yang Kai, binding him while he was still lost in that hazy sensation.

Xue Yue then tugged him forward and with a small powdered fist struck out. The blow carried astonishing energy fluctuations, aimed straight for Yang Kai's heart.

She intended to kill the man who had ogled her body and to protect the greatest secret of her life!

Killing intent assaulted him, yet Yang Kai seemed unmoved; his thieving eyes still roved over Xue Yue's body—the two crimson points on her chest and the gleaming meadow between her legs—each a deadly whirlpool that entranced his spirit and rendered him helpless.

Disgust crept across Xue Yue's graceful face as her fist's fluctuations intensified.

Boom…

The powdered fist struck Yang Kai's heart; fierce qi pierced his body, ravaging his internal organs. He should have died or burst apart, but instead Yang Kai gave an uncanny smile full of derision and, opening his arms, directly embraced her!

Xue Yue's face blanched in an instant as she screamed.

She felt her full breasts compressed against a firm chest, reshaped by the pressure; a staggering heat surged from that chest into her body like sparks and needles, making her tremble, stealing her breath and clouding her thoughts.

She pushed at Yang Kai with both hands, yet found she had no strength.

The earlier explosion of force had utterly drained the weak state she was already in.

She slapped at Yang Kai's shoulders and twisted her body, trying to break free of his embrace, but to no avail; instead the scene took on a comical tinge, like lovers teasing one another.

"Don't move!" Yang Kai growled, his eyes flashing with murderous light as he glared and threatened.

Xue Yue paid him no heed, cursing him a shameless bastard and rogue, all the while redoubling her struggles.

"Awooo…" Yang Kai's expression turned strange; odd sounds issued from his throat and an ecstatic look washed over his face.

The continuous friction of their bodies allowed him to fully sense Xue Yue's flesh—soft yet resilient—and the astonishing spring of those twin peaks.

His eyes burned with desire and he could hardly restrain his longing; his body responded like a man's should.

"You…" Xue Yue's face went as pale as paper; she felt as though a beast had lifted its head between her legs, growing hot and stiff like a branding iron, its head slowly advancing toward her lower parts!
