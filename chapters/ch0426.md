## Chapter 426 — Seizing the Command Banner

After quite some time, the ravaging energy gradually subsided.

Yang Tie’s residence had half been blown away by those six or seven arrows, nearly reduced to ruins!

Huge pits appeared on the ground. Beside those pits, some people crawled up, their faces smeared with dust and dirt; severed limbs and shattered flesh were scattered everywhere, painting a gruesome scene.

The succession war was no child's play; people truly died here!

The countless corpses and rubble confirmed this brutal truth.

The entire Yang Tie mansion fell into a suffocating silence, broken only by intermittent groans.

The stench of blood filled the air.

Among the watching crowd, many female martial artists averted their eyes, covering their mouths, crouching aside, and retching.

Yang Tie watched everything with a cold expression, a hint of ruthlessness flashing across his face.

Yang Kang and Yang Ying’s expressions suddenly darkened. They never expected their third elder brother, in such an absolutely disadvantageous position, to have prepared such a deadly ambush.

Those people were concealed atop the roofs and walls. They were well aware of every position, but they never imagined Yang Tie could acquire such a tremendously powerful killing treasure.

The Broken Star Bow, only an Earth-Grade Upper-Level artifact, yet it could endlessly absorb martial artists’ True Yuan, channeling it all explosively into a single arrow.

The bow shattered as the arrows flew, and the force released injured even the bow-wielding martial artists, blowing them into grievous wounds, their bodies pierced and battered.

Yet Yang Tie achieved his goal.

Though powerless to withstand attacks from Yang Kang and Yang Ying, before his defeat, he managed to sink his teeth deeply into the enemy’s flesh!

“I may fall, but anyone who dares strike me will suffer!” Yang Tie’s Broken Star Bow perfectly embodied his resolve.

That barrage of arrows hit; at least a dozen of Yang Kang and Yang Ying’s subordinates died, including two at the Divine Roaming Realm, more than twenty severely wounded, not to mention countless lightly injured.

Such losses were not insignificant at the start of this succession war.

Yang Kang and Yang Ying’s faces turned grim. Gazing at the carnage below, their anger swelled like a billowing flame.

“Kill them all!” they shouted in unison. The short calm shattered. Those six or seven martial artists injured by the Broken Star Bow’s explosion were too weak to resist and were slain instantly.

All were from the Duanmu Family. Though a first-rate force with many skilled members, they could not afford to throw their entire strength into this succession war.

Moreover, since Yang Tie was destined to lose, the Duanmu Family had only sent what forces they could muster, already prepared to sacrifice them all.

Thus, while several died, the others barely flinched.

“Old Seven, I think we should settle this Third Brother first, don’t you agree, Fifth Brother?” Yang Kang asked gloomily, looking at the motionless Yang Tie, then toward Yang Ying.

“Exactly my thought!” Yang Ying nodded lightly.

“The person and command banner’s ownership—let’s settle it by any means necessary,” Yang Kang snorted. With one command, their forces surged toward Yang Tie.

At the same time, Yang Ying issued his attack order.

In an instant, both directed their spearheads toward Yang Tie and the Duanmu Family.

Among the Duanmu Family’s martial artists present, only two were Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage, the rest insignificant. Though they managed to regain some face with six or seven Broken Star Bows, they could not gain any advantage in a head-on clash.

The two Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage fighters desperately defended Yang Ying, steadily retreating. Soon they were severely pressed.

Just then, one person from each of Yang Kang and Yang Ying’s forces quietly slipped from the battlefield, concealing their presence as they headed straight for Yang Tie’s mansion’s central hall.

That was where Yang Tie’s command banner hung.

Yang Tie saw this but was powerless to block their advance, unwillingness and helplessness welling on his face.

“Be ready.” Yang Kai, who had been watching silently, suddenly spoke in a low, sharp tone. Feng and Yun's expressions tightened — they knew Yang Kai was finally about to act.

Glancing at the two, Yang Kai smiled, “Though your strengths are not weak, in this chaotic melee with many, you will gain no advantage.”

Feng Wei nodded, “You are right, Young Master Kai. Among them are some whose strength meets or even surpasses ours. Just give the orders, and Old Yun and I will cooperate fully.”

“Just follow me, feint a few moves inside, don’t linger. Strike and withdraw immediately,” Yang Kai warned quietly.

The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians were experts of the Dong Family and had served Dong Qinghan many years. Their deaths here would be a huge blow to her.

Yang Kai had brought them merely to stir the waters, not to risk their lives.

“Agreed.” The two Guardians nodded seriously.

Feigning a few moves was no real danger. Their greatest concern was the Yang Family Blood Servants Hall martial artists, but so long as they didn’t attack Yang Kang and Yang Ying, the Blood Servants would leave them be.

“Also, help Yang Ying’s men attack Yang Kang’s forces, but don’t fight both sides at once.”

Attacking only one side would sow confusion among Yang Kang’s men, who might momentarily mistake them for allies. Though they’d quickly realize otherwise, it created a fleeting chance for Yang Kai.

If they attacked both sides, they would only exhaust themselves for no gain.

Meanwhile, two Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage martial artists suddenly burst from Yang Tie’s central hall—one from Yang Kang’s camp, the other aligned with Yang Ying. One fled holding a command banner, a faint smile of triumph on his face, while the other gave chase.

Clearly, the first was swifter and had seized the banner.

Yang Kang’s eyes lit up; ignoring the chaos below, he shouted, “Come here!”

The banner-bearer hurried toward Yang Kang. Once the banner reached him and given Tang Yuxian’s protection, it was nearly unassailable.

“Dream on!” Yang Ying snorted coldly, charging forward with the Blood Servants behind him.

“Old Seven, stay!” Yang Kang laughed heartily, leaping forward to intercept.

The Blood Servant behind Yang Ying hastened to assist. Tang Yuxian’s soul technique burst forth violently!

In an instant, Yang Kang and Yang Ying clashed fiercely, while Tang Yuxian and the other Blood Servant also engaged in heated battle.

Amidst the chaos, Yang Kai led the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians as they dashed into the fray.

Many eyes were on them; some noticed but only observed, suspicious of their identity rather than alerting Yang Kang or Yang Ying.

The Yang family’s two direct heirs fought single combat; two Blood Servants Hall experts also fought one-on-one; the two Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage fighters who ran from the hall were similarly engaged. The rest fiercely attacked the Duanmu Family, trying to capture Yang Tie.

The war city had divided into four sectors.

The Duanmu Family’s martial artists were all dead or severely wounded, only four or five stubbornly resisting. The two Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage fighters bore heavy injuries, clearly faltering.

Yang Kai whispered instructions to Feng and Yun, then alone dashed toward the two Divine Roaming Realm fighting over the command banner.

Before he arrived, his Divine Sense erupted fiercely!

A strange and terrifying Divine Sense suddenly engulfed the entire Yang Tie residence like a mountain pressing down.

All engaged fighters’ faces shifted; attacks immediately turned defensive.

This was Divine Sense power at the peak of Divine Roaming Realm.

The two Blood Servants instantly separated, quickly shielding Yang Kang and Yang Ying, their eyes alert in all directions.

The two Divine Roaming Realm disputants lowered their bodies, nearly kneeling, terror-stricken by the unknown overwhelming force.

Just as they prepared to strike, a dark shadow darted before them.

Both scoffed coldly and struck toward the shadow.

A strange purple spectral light rippled out like a stone dropped into a calm lake, spreading visible ripples in all directions.

“A soul technique!” they shouted, but before they could react, a floral scent arose, and blood-red petals filled with killing intent swirled all around.

Caught unprepared, both were hit simultaneously; their Sea of Consciousness cooled sharply, causing them to shudder. Though strong and steady-minded, the soul technique of Yang Kai inflicted no damage. The following Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, however, threw them into disarray.

In that brief moment, Yang Kai had reached the banner-bearer. Revealing his white sharp fangs with a sinister grin in the dark, he seized the command banner with a chopping hand.

“You…” the martial artist’s eyes almost popped out. He knew the Yang Family’s eight participants in the succession war well — but never expected to meet the youngest one here.

For a moment, he felt as if dreaming, doubting his own vision.

Yang Kai gave no time for recovery. The Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia continued to entangle as he soared upward, tossing the banner aloft.

In the night, a streak of golden light flashed, and golden claws precisely grasped Yang Tie’s command banner before vanishing.

The sound of wingbeats faded into the distance.

It was the Golden Feather Eagle!

“You idiot!” the Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage martial artist in Yang Ying’s camp snarled angrily, seeing how the banner-bearer offered no resistance and lost it so easily, unaware of the shock and doubt in his opponent’s heart.

“It’s him... he...” the man stammered, unable to explain.

By contrast, Tang Yuxian, guarding Yang Kang, frowned deeply as she focused on the golden eagle’s fading direction. A strange glow appeared in her beautiful eyes, and when she looked gently at the face-concealed Yang Kai, her expression softened.
