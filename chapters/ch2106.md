## Chapter 2106 — Windfall

Before Yang Kai hid inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, he hurriedly gave Liu Yan a few instructions.

Liu Yan's identity was unusual, making it difficult for her to move about freely, so he had her stay temporarily with the Zhang family outside the city as a last resort.

In those brief moments of clarity, Yang Kai thought through many matters.

His condition was undoubtedly dangerous. Not only did he risk losing his mind and becoming a demon, but if he hadn't hidden inside the Xuan Realm Pearl and had acted recklessly outside, Chen Wenhao and the others would surely track him down and leave him with no escape.

Moreover, in that bloodthirsty state he had an instinctive urge to slaughter. If he accidentally broke into Fenglin City, he feared he might massacre the entire city.

He had nowhere to go but the Small Xuan Realm.

Inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, Yang Kai's consciousness was hazy and muddled. If not for the Warm Spirit Lotus in his Sea of Consciousness guarding his last shred of sanity, he would have long since been consumed by that overwhelming power and lost all sense of self.

At that moment, the seven-colored radiance of the Warm Spirit Lotus was entangled with the demonic will of the Ancient Giant Demon; the two were evenly matched, leaving Yang Kai helpless.

If it were only a crisis within his Sea of Consciousness, it would be manageable. With the Warm Spirit Lotus's power, Yang Kai believed he could keep his mind intact.

However, his physical body was filled with ancient, pure Demonic Qi. When the demonic will invaded, it spread across tens of thousands of li, and even the Demonic Qi from the demonic creatures had converged into his body.

The Warm Spirit Lotus was powerful, but its effect was limited to the soul and did not touch the physical body.

If the problem with his body wasn't resolved, he would eventually be dragged onto the ancient demonic path.

Roars and howls rang out continuously. The oppressive, terrifying atmosphere—stirred by Yang Kai's emotions—threw the Small Xuan Realm's Spiritual Qi into chaos.

Hua Qingsi, face pale, hid beneath the Incarnation's legs, using those broad thighs as a shelter from the storm. Her beautiful eyes stared fearfully toward the source of the noise.

Her powerful cultivation at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was like a lone boat in a stormy sea amid the tidal wave of power Yang Kai had stirred up, always in danger of capsizing.

The Incarnation also wore a grave expression, his shining eyes full of worry, yet he was helpless.

Gradually the roars swelled. Driven by instinct, Yang Kai seemed to rampage and destroy everything within the Small Xuan Realm.

Sand and stones flew, the earth cracked, and mountains rose and fell as rocks tumbled down.

Suddenly the endless roars stopped. The earth-shaking commotion vanished in an instant.

Hua Qingsi sensed the change for a moment, then asked with difficulty, "Over there... what happened?"

The Incarnation squinted, his gaze seeming to pierce the void. In a deep voice he said, "It seems he regained some clarity."

"If I went over now and begged him to let me out... what would happen?" Hua Qingsi couldn't stand the torment any longer, and a ridiculous thought sprang up in her heart.

"You can try!" The Incarnation replied with a casual glance, then suddenly looked into the distance and exclaimed in surprise.

Immediately his eyes lit up. "That's right—maybe that thing will have a miraculous effect!"

"What thing?" Hua Qingsi asked, alarmed.

The Incarnation ignored her, making the beautiful woman pout in frustration.

On the other side, taking advantage of a brief moment of clarity, Yang Kai rushed to the medicine garden.

The last time he had been clear-headed he realized his greatest problem was the surging Demonic Qi in his body. Unless that Demonic Qi was resolved, he would never be free of the Ancient Giant Demon's will.

He suddenly thought of the Everlasting Tree planted in the medicine garden.

The Everlasting Tree was undying and eternal, existing since time immemorial.

If he could find a way to fuse it into his body, he might gain the legendary undying body and, with the Everlasting Tree's power, suppress the Demonic Qi within him.

The Xuan Realm Pearl had been refined by Yang Kai; within the Small Xuan Realm his will was absolute.

With a single thought he arrived at the medicine garden, sat cross-legged before the Everlasting Tree, and began circulating his cultivation technique, trying to draw the tree's power into himself.

When he first obtained the Everlasting Tree he had tried to refine it, but was at a loss and eventually gave up.

Back then he had been only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm—perhaps his cultivation was not high enough.

Now he had reached the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, a whole realm higher than before, so it was worth another attempt.

But he soon discovered with dismay that even at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm he couldn't draw power from the Everlasting Tree. The modest tree was rooted in the medicine garden, radiating astonishing vitality that filled the Small Xuan Realm with life, yet it would not respond to him.

Yang Kai's eyes dimmed and a trace of despair rose in his heart.

In ordinary circumstances such a feeling would have been nothing of note.

But now, with the ancient demonic will entangling him, his despair was magnified. Instantly, the entire Small Xuan Realm filled with a heavy atmosphere. Even Hua Qingsi, far away, was swept up by this gloom—her pretty face turning mournful and on the verge of tears.

Affected by the mood, she seemed to imagine herself trapped in that strange space for life, growing old alone.

Even in death, her only companion would be a a lump of rock.

She hurriedly wiped the corners of her eyes; her fingers came away damp...

The Incarnation let out a heavy sigh.

"Why do I suddenly feel so sad?" Hua Qingsi looked up at the Incarnation, wiping her eyes, but the tears kept falling like broken pearls no matter how often she wiped.

The Incarnation stretched out a hand as broad as a door and gently patted Hua Qingsi's head.

The beautiful woman's body instantly shrank, and she cried out, "I'm so sad, why am I crying like this... Ugh, it's so annoying, I can't stop the tears..."

As she spoke her eyes were already swollen like peaches.

"Eh..." the Incarnation exclaimed again. This time he suddenly stood, staring into the distance as if witnessing something incredible. The eyes embedded in his stone head trembled with emotion as he cried out, "This is..."

In the medicine garden Yang Kai sat cross-legged before the Everlasting Tree, trying to draw its power but failing.

Unintentionally, however, he drew in another force.

The Gold-and-Silver Bicolored Tree beside the Everlasting Tree suddenly trembled, and two beams of light burst from its trunk.

One gold, one silver.

Incomparably pure.

The gold and silver radiance danced like spirits in the wind, breaking into flecks that fluttered around Yang Kai like butterflies.

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned.

This Gold-and-Silver Bicolored Tree had grown from a seed he obtained after killing Mu Xiao.

The seed had been gold and silver, each color occupying half; Yang Kai had no idea what kind of seed it was.

Mu Xiao had existed since ancient times and must have originated from an ancient spirit tree gaining sentience. In other words, the gold-and-silver seed was also from an ancient miraculous tree.

He planned to investigate it slowly in the future.

But now the Gold-and-Silver Bicolored Tree was releasing power that left him momentarily dazed.

Just as he stood bewildered, the gold and silver radiance shot into his body and vanished.

After a brief shock Yang Kai gave a bitter smile.

He had no idea what effects or dangers the gold and silver radiance might bring, but with the Demonic Qi raging in his body, it was like having so many debts that a few more didn't matter.

Yang Kai simply let them enter his body.

In the next instant his body trembled violently, his eyes widened, and a sharp light shot forth.

The Demonic Qi that had been surging over his skin suddenly seemed suppressed, roaring as it rushed back into his body through his pores.

In no time Yang Kai's figure reappeared.

At the same time the Demonic Qi in his body was compressed by a mysterious force, gathering into a single spot.

The Demonic Qi was terrifying, but the mysterious force was unbelievably strong, herding all the Demonic Qi into his lower abdomen as if driving sheep.

Immediately a burning pain flared in his lower abdomen. As soon as Yang Kai cried out, the burning heat shifted to bone-chilling cold.

He couldn't help but shiver as cold seeped through him.

Before he could adapt, the sensation alternated between burning and freezing—again and again.

Who knew how many times it repeated—Yang Kai was nearly tormented to death. Suddenly dazzling gold-and-silver radiance burst from his lower abdomen.

Yang Kai's whole body trembled. Realizing something, he tore open his shirt and looked down.

At his lower abdomen, the gold-and-silver lights swirled like two fish, head to tail, swimming rapidly.

As they swam, a mysterious, intricate pattern gradually formed—like a brand.

After a moment the gold-and-silver radiance flared and then vanished in a flash.

Yang Kai let out a miserable scream and fainted on the spot.

A gentle breeze blew and the Small Xuan Realm fell silent.

Only the distant Incarnation muttered, "What on earth was that?"

"What was what?" Hua Qingsi emerged from the shadow of grief, rubbing her eyes and shyly asking, "Did that guy die?"

The Incarnation glanced at her and grinned. "Sorry to disappoint you—he's alive and well."

"Damn it!" Hua Qingsi gnashed her teeth. "He actually made me cry like a little girl!" Her face flushed with shame and anger as she vowed, "If I don't get revenge, I'm not human!"

After speaking she looked at the Incarnation. "Big Rock, you'll help me, right?"

"Oh? So you already have a plan for revenge?" the Incarnation asked with interest.

Hua Qingsi smiled, hair flying, her charm focused and full of confidence. "Even heroes can't resist a beauty."

The Incarnation nodded repeatedly in approval.
