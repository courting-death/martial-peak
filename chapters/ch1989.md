## Chapter 1989 — Such A Waste

"Is this a beast egg?" Yang Kai asked, utterly astonished. "How do you know it's a beast egg?"

"I just know." Mo Xiaoqi replied, shaking her head and grinning with pride. "Anyway, this thing is absolutely unmistakable — I just don't know which kind of Demonic Beast laid it, but I can feel it should be very formidable."

"You have a secret technique to sense it?" Yang Kai asked thoughtfully as he looked at her.

“Yeah! This is the thing I was just fighting that Fei Sheng Palace fellow over. Perhaps he too sensed there was something extraordinary about it.”

"If you're certain it's a beast egg, then pack it away carefully." Yang Kai did not know much about such matters, but since Mo Xiaoqi claimed to have a secret sensing technique, it was unlikely she was mistaken.

That was probably the only thing she had gained from wandering the black market.

"By the way, Xiaoqi, do you know anything about the Heaven Devouring Battle Art?" Yang Kai suddenly recalled something and asked.

"The Heaven Devouring Battle Art... that's the Heaven Devouring Emperor's technique, of course I know about it." Mo Xiaoqi nodded. "The Heaven Devouring Emperor rose to the peak by relying on that supreme art, ultimately becoming a top Emperor. In his era he was terrifyingly powerful; even among the Ten Emperors he could rank in the top three."

"Oh? And the Heaven Devouring Emperor now..."

"The Heaven Devouring Emperor perished long ago." Mo Xiaoqi smiled faintly. "Rumor has it the Heaven Devouring Battle Art is intolerable to the world, that the emperor cultivated to the end and was rejected by the laws of heaven and earth, thus falling into Qi Deviation and dying, but I know..." she smiled mysteriously and lowered her voice, "that is false."

"So what is the real truth?"

"The Heaven Devouring Emperor was ganged up on by his peers and fell within the Shattered Star Sea," Mo Xiaoqi said, and as she spoke her expression suddenly turned gravely solemn, more than it had ever been.

Yang Kai's eyelids tightened and he said in a measured voice, "If the Heaven Devouring Emperor could rank among the top three of the Ten Emperors, those who dared besiege him..."

"Shh..." Mo Xiaoqi put a finger to her lips to signal silence. "This is a big secret. I only heard fragments of it when Uncle Li and Aunt Feng were chatting. Eldest Brother Yang, you must not go spreading this, or it could very well bring deadly trouble; very few people in the world know this secret."

"I understand that. But... why would those powers join to besiege the Heaven Devouring Emperor?"

"That I do not know." Mo Xiaoqi shook her head.

Given Mo Xiaoqi's nature, if she truly knew something she would never hide it; since she could not explain, then she truly did not know. Yang Kai did not press the matter further.

Yang Kai nevertheless instinctively felt that the reason the Heaven Devouring Emperor was besieged might have been related to that Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

It seemed he should study that Heaven Devouring Battle Art! Although Yang Kai suspected Wu Mengchuan had taught him the art with ill intent, it was after all a technique wielded by one of the Ten Emperors; to let it sit unused would be a pity.

The two chatted for a while longer before Mo Xiaoqi took her leave.

As she was leaving, Mo Xiaoqi gave Yang Kai a voice bead and told him that if he wanted to find her, he only needed to pour Divine Sense into the bead.

Yang Kai naturally nodded in agreement.

Mo Xiaoqi was overly simple-minded, but she came from an extraordinary background, was full of treasures, and possessed experiences and insights in certain matters that Yang Kai could not match; perhaps one day he might indeed borrow her strength.

Yang Kai would naturally not refuse her goodwill.

Besides, they were all now settled in Fenglin City; deepening their ties would make it easier to look after one another in case of emergency.

The voice bead functioned much like a Transmission Compass, but Mo Xiaoqi's bead had been specially crafted and was far more convenient. Judging by its energy fluctuations, it was clearly a Void King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure.

After seeing Mo Xiaoqi off, Yang Kai arranged a large number of Source Crystals in his cave abode and, without counting the cost, activated all the forbidden arrays.

He had quite a few Source Crystals on hand now, so he would not be stingy in this regard.

Once safety and secrecy were assured, he produced the Xuan Realm Pearl and entered it alone.

The Small Xuan Realm remained tranquil; when Yang Kai released his Divine Sense, the whole Small Xuan Realm's situation became clear at a glance.

In the medicinal garden, the herbs he had obtained from the Lost Realm were thriving; these were Void King-Grade materials which, if refined into Spiritual Pills, would greatly aid Void King Realm cultivators.

Previously Yang Kai had been reluctant to use them because such materials were rare back in his home Star Domain, but now that he was in the Star Realm where resources were richer, these herbs were no longer so precious.

So he decided to refine all those herbs into Spiritual Pills for his own cultivation needs.

He could also use them to hone his pill-refining, seeing whether he could break through the Dao Origin-Grade bottleneck. If successful, he would become a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist.

In the Star Realm, Void King-Grade alchemists were common, but a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist was unquestionably a prominent figure.

Yang Kai's current strength was not high; having the identity of a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist as a shield might save his life in a crisis.

After some busy work, Yang Kai gathered all the Void King-Grade medicinal materials, sorted them by type, and prepared to refine them into pills once he went out.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, aside from the herbs in the garden, only the Yao Worm Matriarch he had captured and the anomalous Ice Flower fruit from the base of the Ice Cliff remained.

The area where the Ice Flower fruit lay was unbearably cold, yet the Yao Worm Matriarch slept there like it was blissfully absorbing the strange cold energy radiating from the Ice Flower, strengthening itself.

After that period of recuperation and integration, the Yao Worm Matriarch, which had been transformed into a Blood Beast, had healed considerably; the many wounds it once bore showed signs of closing.

After all, although the Yao Worm Matriarch's original body was dead, Yang Kai's pure Golden Blood had powerful restorative properties.

What surprised Yang Kai most was that the Purple-Green Twin Swords Mo Xiaoqi had once given him were now beginning to partially fuse with the Yao Worm Matriarch's flesh.

The Purple-Green Twin Swords were Void King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures; combined they rivaled a typical Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure, and being ice-attribute, they were perfect for the Yao Worm Matriarch. When Yang Kai had obtained them at Yuqing Mountain, he had not hesitated to throw them into the Small Xuan Realm.

Now it seemed the two long swords had actually fused with the Yao Worm Matriarch's previously severed pincers, showing signs of becoming one.

This was strange; Yang Kai had only intended to find a suitable weapon for the Yao Worm Matriarch, which was why he left the Purple-Green Twin Swords inside.

On closer thought, though the Yao Worm Matriarch now counted as his Blood Beast, the dim consciousness inside it had been forged from sword-intent’s sentience, so it possessed an instinctive affinity for sword-shaped Secret Treasures.

Blood Beast, sentient sword-intent, and the worm's body — when these things blended completely, Yang Kai could not find the words to describe the monster the Yao Worm Matriarch might become.

It was a pity it lacked true consciousness and could not be called a living being; otherwise Yang Kai would look forward to seeing how far it might grow.

After observing the Yao Worm Matriarch for a while and confirming it was well, Yang Kai found a place to sit cross-legged, took an Origin Condensing Pill, converted his Origin Qi, and began to ponder in his mind.

He intended to comprehend the Heaven Devouring Battle Art that Wu Mengchuan had taught him!

Back in the Bone Prison he had skimmed through the technique and felt its power and strangeness, but he had not had sufficient time to study it carefully.

Moreover, upon learning the art's grand origins, Yang Kai suspected Wu Mengchuan's ill intent and was not eager to practice such a technique.

Yet not practicing did not render it useless; stones from other hills can polish jade — perhaps from this set of methods one might glean a thread of insight.

Yang Kai soon entered a state of complete absorption.

Over his cultivation years he had encountered many techniques and secret methods and had developed a certain discernment and insight.

As he studied, he found the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to be more profound and powerful than any method he had previously met.

It devoured all things that possessed Spiritual Qi in heaven and earth and transformed them for one's own use; upon reaching its pinnacle one could forge an Imperial Body and even devour the sun, moon, and stars themselves.

Yang Kai's heart trembled.

The creator of this art, the Heaven Devouring Emperor, must have been a madman!

He actually sought to devour and refine even the stars and the very heavens!

Yet in the next instant Yang Kai felt great admiration for the Heaven Devouring Emperor; mad or not, such a person must have had talent to reshape heaven and earth, otherwise no one could invent such an art.

The world rumor that the Heaven Devouring Battle Art was intolerable to heaven and earth was not entirely groundless.

Such an art could not be tolerated by the laws of creation, nor by other Emperors; the Heaven Devouring Emperor's end — being besieged by other Emperors and falling in the Shattered Star Sea — could be said to be a consequence of his deeds.

However...

Yang Kai keenly perceived something amiss within the art.

Devouring and refining all things with Spiritual Qi for one's own use sounded tempting and could allow rapid growth, but such unrestrained devouring must carry great hidden dangers.

Different energies of all things were incompatible; if one swallowed them into a single body without very strong capacity to bear and transform them, in the end the various energies would collide and Qi Deviation would be inevitable.

The clearest example was Wu Mengchuan.

The old man's twisted temperament, cruelty, and brutality — killing even loyal followers without blinking — was clearly related to cultivating this art.

If the art were truly so miraculous, Wu Mengchuan would not still be at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm now.

He would long since have ascended to the Emperor Realm.

"Such a waste!" Yang Kai sighed deeply.

Such a top-tier technique falling into his hands, yet becoming something that was useless to keep but too good to discard, truly made him lament.

In any case, he would never gamble his future; he would not cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

The path toward the Emperor Realm is by no means a single one.
