## Chapter 21 — I’ll Give You Three Moves

The bloodstains and scars were naturally the marks left from the battle with the Flower-Backed Spider. There had been no time to treat them then, and upon returning to Wumei Town to seek medical help for that little boy, more time was lost. Afterwards, Yang Kai fell into a deep sleep.

He did not awaken until the next morning. The boy was already awake as well, so Yang Kai left without worry and hurried back to the sect. From afar, he saw a crowd gathered around his wooden hut, some holding torches. Judging by the scene, they intended to burn down his house. Yang Kai would not allow that. He strode forward to inquire, only to discover that Su Mu was the one causing trouble.

When the main culprit appeared, Su Mu, frustrated at failing to set fire, showed no remorse. Instead, he grew even more excited, pointing at Yang Kai and declaring, “Yang Kai, don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. As long as you can…”

“Wait a moment.” Yang Kai raised his hand to stop him, then calmly walked into the hut.

“Hey…” Su Mu’s words caught in his throat, feeling as if he had swallowed a fly—one that had just risen from fresh dung. The discomfort was indescribable.

“Young Master Su, this man is truly disrespectful,” one of Su Mu’s followers complained on his behalf.

“Hmph!” Su Mu sneered coldly. “Beat him mercilessly later. I heard this brat never admits defeat, so don’t hold back. Today, he must learn the consequences of offending me.”

“Yes, sir.”

Yang Kai entered the hut and took down the small bundle of herbs from his shoulder. This collection of herbs was the fruit of three days’ hard work, and he felt uneasy leaving it unattended.

After placing the bundle safely, Yang Kai emerged once more, his expression serious as he looked at Su Mu. “What were you about to say just now?”

Su Mu glared at him with a face full of grievance, as if he were about to vomit blood.

He had spent quite some time preparing his words, only to be interrupted by Yang Kai. Now, seeing him ask again, Su Mu could no longer contain his pride and shouted with great fanfare, “Yang Kai, don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. If today, in front of all our fellow disciples, you kneel and kowtow a few times, calling me ‘grandfather’ a few times, I’ll spare your life! Otherwise… hm hm hm…”

The ominous hums carried a clear threat.

Having said this, Su Mu’s face was filled with the satisfaction of revenge, as if he truly believed he could do something to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, looking at Su Mu with a mixture of pain and sorrow.

“What’s wrong?” Su Mu felt a chill in his heart. Yang Kai’s calm demeanor unsettled him, especially since he had suffered a loss to Yang Kai in Wumei Town, leaving a shadow on his spirit.

“You are unfilial!” Yang Kai sighed.

The onlookers were stunned, and Su Mu was bewildered. How was that unfilial?

“What do you mean?” Su Mu growled fiercely.

“Don’t understand? Let me teach you.” Yang Kai put on the air of a kindly mentor and patiently explained, “Let me ask you, do you have elders in Lingxiao Pavilion?”

“Looks like you have some insight!” Su Mu’s tail practically wagged with pride.

Yang Kai smiled inwardly. Su Mu had come all this way to seek revenge because he had backing. Without powerful support, how could he dare to act so recklessly, even attempting to burn down Yang Kai’s house?

“This person holds considerable authority within the sect, yes?” Yang Kai continued.

“An Elder!” Su Mu snorted. “I even have an older sister who is a Core Disciple! She could crush you with a single finger!”

Yang Kai’s understanding of Su Mu’s background deepened. He patted Su Mu’s shoulder. “That’s right. You are truly unfilial.”

“What do you mean by that?” Su Mu was furious, his head spinning from Yang Kai’s words, still unsure what he was getting at.

“Such a simple matter and you can’t figure it out? How did you grow such a brain?” Yang Kai frowned, looking at Su Mu with pity and patiently explaining, “Your sister is your senior disciple by rank. If I were to call you that… what would your sister call you? And how would that Elder address you? It’s unfilial, utterly unfilial! If I were that Elder, I’d lock you in the Dragon Confinement Ravine today and never let you out.”

Su Mu’s body trembled, his face pale. The Dragon Confinement Ravine was the most terrifying place in Lingxiao Pavilion. Over its centuries of existence, many disciples had committed heinous crimes after leaving the sect. Those irredeemable sinners, once caught by the sect, would have their cultivation stripped and be cast into the Dragon Confinement Ravine—essentially a death sentence.

The name Dragon Confinement Ravine was infamous for thousands of li around.

Su Mu was not afraid of Yang Kai, but hearing those words instinctively filled him with dread.

Noticing Su Mu’s change in demeanor, one of his followers quickly stepped forward. “Young Master Su, this brat is sharp-tongued. Don’t waste your breath arguing with him. We came today to vent your anger.”

“Mm.” Su Mu regained his composure, his face flushed with shame and anger. “Yang Kai, stop talking nonsense. If you don’t kneel and apologize today, I will make you regret ever being born.”

A cold light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes. He clenched his fist and said, “So, Senior Brother Su wishes to spar with me?”

Su Mu sneered, “I would like to, but you’re not worthy! I am at Body Tempering Realm, Stage Nine!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood. The sect’s rules stated that disciples could only challenge each other if their cultivation levels differed by no more than three stages. Su Mu could not challenge Yang Kai—the gap was too great.

This was why Su Mu had brought reinforcements; they were not mere spectators.

Su Mu looked at Yang Kai with contempt, a cold smile playing on his lips. Without turning his head, he said, “Brothers, this Senior Brother Yang is said to be at Body Tempering Realm, Stage Three. Who will step forward to teach him a lesson?”

“Body Tempering Realm, Stage Three? Such a high level!” The crowd laughed uproariously. Everyone present had joined the sect later than Yang Kai, but all were at higher realms.

“I’ll go, Young Master Su. I’m the weakest among us, but at Body Tempering Realm, Stage Five, I should be able to keep Senior Brother Yang occupied for a while.” One man stepped forward, sneering at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled back, knowing their information was outdated.

Five days ago, he had indeed been at Stage Three, but times had changed.

Of course, Yang Kai would not boast about such matters. Advancing two stages in five days was unusual.

The man Su Mu brought forward introduced himself, “Senior Brother Yang, my name is Zhao Hu. Remember who defeated you today!”

“I’ve got it noted.” Yang Kai replied seriously.

Zhao Hu seemed intent on boosting Su Mu’s face. Boldly, he beckoned Yang Kai with a crooked finger. “Senior Brother Yang, don’t say your juniors don’t show you respect. I’ll give you three moves. If you can make me take a step back, you win. If not, don’t blame us juniors for being merciless.”

This arrogant provocation was dripping with blatant disdain. Su Mu watched, eyes sparkling, heart filled with delight. He thought Zhao Hu was truly capable, knowing exactly how to humiliate someone. This was a job well done.

Though Stage Three and Stage Five of the Body Tempering Realm were only two stages apart, there was a watershed between them. Their true strength was incomparable.
