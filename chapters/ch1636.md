## Chapter 1636 — Kill

"A nearly perfected force." Yang Kai raised his brow, and at once sensed why Jiang Xi was feared by that young matron of Ice Heart Valley — there was a reason: with this nearly perfected force alone, Jiang Xi indeed qualified as one of the candidates who could break through to the Void King Realm.

The field of Shi was extraordinarily powerful and quickly spread until it enveloped Yang Kai.

In the moment before it wrapped around him, an equally profound, mysterious power burst forth from Yang Kai and rushed back against it.

The collision was silent and invisible to the naked eye.

Yet Jiang Xi felt his spirit quake and heard the crackling sounds within his heart.

His once-proud, nearly perfected field of Shi suddenly felt like an eggshell striking a great stone, shattering bit by bit, utterly unable to hold. In the blink of an eye Jiang Xi was shrouded by a thick, oppressive power.

His opponent's Shi!

Jiang Xi's face drained of color. Only now did he realize Yang Kai was not as simple as he appeared. Though his cultivation was at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his comprehension of Shi far surpassed Jiang Xi's.

He frantically urged his Saint Yuan to resist the suppression of the Shi, while multicolored poisonous mist spread out around him, gathering into clusters of toxic clouds that served as his defense. At the same time, streams of dazzlingly colored energy separated from the clouds and shot toward Yang Kai, unleashing a terrifyingly lethal assault.

Though suppressed in the contest of Shi, Jiang Xi was resourceful and refused to lie down and die.

He was skilled in poison; those mists posed a lethal threat to any flesh-and-blood body.

Yang Kai frowned and dared not risk himself. After a moment he stretched out a hand and summoned the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird. Accompanied by a shrill cry, the ten zhang-long fiery red strange bird appeared, opened its beak and spat forth volley after volley of scorching fireballs that rained down on Jiang Xi.

Jiang Xi was in utter disarray—his poisonous mist couldn’t harm the Fire Bird in the slightest. Instead, it was blasted full of holes by the Fire Bird’s fireballs, vast portions evaporating away. His body, once shrouded within the toxic fog, was gradually exposed, and his expression was one of complete humiliation.

The Fire Bird increased the speed and frequency of its fireball spits, and Jiang Xi was struck with such relentlessness that he had no strength to fight back, only desperately parrying while repeatedly using Saint Yuan to reform the poisonous mists outside his body. But those mists could not hold; each time they formed they were scattered the moment they appeared.

Yang Kai stood unmoving, firm as a mountain, his cold gaze fixed on Jiang Xi. A feral grin crossed his face as he said, “Old fool, you’re really useless.”

The women of Ice Heart Valley stared blankly, their gazes vacant as they watched the scene.

With just a single strangely appearing Fire Bird working with Yang Kai's Shi to suppress Jiang Xi so thoroughly, if Yang Kai seized the right moment, Jiang Xi quite possibly would die on the spot.

They simply could not make sense of the strange events unfolding before them.

They had braced themselves for heavy casualties and assumed they would not escape this calamity; they had prepared for the worst.

Yet when Yang Kai acted, his move was so exaggerated and odd that it left them speechless.

Just that single Fire Bird had Jiang Xi completely tied up, leaving him utterly powerless to fight back. He was in a miserable state, unable to spare even a shred of focus to deal with the others.

This time, perhaps they would not die… each woman's heart leapt, and their eyes toward Yang Kai changed, filled with awe and gratitude.

The Fire Bird grew ever more valiant; brilliant flames shot from its mouth and from its wings, preventing Jiang Xi's poison mists from forming on any scale and carving one wound after another, large and small, into Jiang Xi's body.

The tang of scorched flesh gradually filled the air.

Jiang Xi's expression twisted; he suddenly produced a Secret Treasure crackling with energy and breathed a gout of five-colored poisonous smoke into it.

The Secret Treasure absorbed the five-colored smoke, twisting and changing rapidly until it transformed into a gigantic, multicolored python.

The venomous serpent writhed and shot up into the sky to confront the mighty Fire Bird.

Seizing the chance, Jiang Xi once more stirred Saint Yuan, breaking free momentarily from Yang Kai's suppressive field and charged toward Yang Kai like a bolt of thunder.

He clearly intended to settle Yang Kai then and there; if Yang Kai died, Jiang Xi could do as he pleased.

As for Fire Radiance Sect elder Yan Chilei's instructions… in this moment Jiang Xi could barely keep himself alive, let alone care about another's orders.

In the blink of an eye he closed to within only ten zhang of Yang Kai. The scant poisonous mists that had hung about him seemed to gain sentience and twisted away from his body, forming terrifying strikes that shot toward Yang Kai.

The women of Ice Heart Valley finally snapped back to their senses. The leading young matron cried out, "Help!"

As she spoke, ice energy rolled from her delicate body and ice spears of considerable power formed and streaked toward Jiang Xi's rear.

The other women reacted as well, each unleashing deadly moves and secret arts against Jiang Xi.

Golden light flashed again; the Golden Blood Threads suspended before Yang Kai straightened under his hand, and with a slight tremor they suddenly vanished from sight.

Jiang Xi's soul nearly left his body. In that moment he felt that if he did not flee he would die. As if driven by some unseen force, he stopped, gritted his teeth, and dodged aside.

The Golden Blood Threads suddenly reappeared and pierced the phantom he had left behind.

Cold sweat broke out on Jiang Xi; before he could fully recover, waves upon waves of attacks from those ten or so Ice Heart Valley women crashed down upon him.

The area where he stood was instantly covered by hundreds of ice spears.

Heaven-and-Earth Energy went awry, and faintly Jiang Xi's muffled groans could be heard, clearly showing he had been wounded.

The Ice Heart Valley disciples were not as strong as Jiang Xi individually—one-on-one they might easily be slain—but the combined might of a dozen was not to be underestimated.

Dust billowed and the scene descended into chaos.

The young matron leading Ice Heart Valley's disciples felt her heart stop and nervously stared at the place.

"Is he dead?" someone asked.

Before the words fell, Jiang Xi's voice echoed from afar: "You wretched bitches of Ice Heart Valley, just you wait—sooner or later I will storm Icebound Island and tear you all apart!"

He had escaped at some unknown time.

The young matron went white and turned to look toward the voice. There she saw a streak of multicolored light vanish at tremendous speed; who else could that figure be, wrapped in those colors, if not Jiang Xi?

She immediately glanced toward Yang Kai, hoping he could intercept.

But she froze again: Yang Kai's original position was empty; he was nowhere to be seen.

With a hunch she looked once more in the direction Jiang Xi had fled, and when she saw the figure blocking Jiang Xi's path she finally understood.

This battle had reached a level far beyond what they could touch—neither Jiang Xi nor Yang Kai were on the same order of magnitude as the women here; their foundations surpassed them by countless ranks.

They had no idea when Yang Kai and Jiang Xi had begun pursuing one another and then escaped.

"How could you…" Jiang Xi stared at Yang Kai blocking his way, eyes wide as if seeing a ghost.

He had just used the chaos of the energy and the diverted attention of his enemies to employ a secret art to flee, thinking he would do so undetected. Yet this youth had foreseen it and intercepted him.

Though fearful, Jiang Xi was ruthless; he knew that unless he broke through Yang Kai's blockade he could not escape. Gritting his teeth, he spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood, his aura inexplicably surging three degrees, a faint bloodlight covering his body, and he charged Yang Kai without fear.

Yang Kai's expression chilled; he snorted and sneered, "Courting death!"

Without dodging, he raised a fist. Immediately the fist's surface was sheathed in golden light, threaded with faint sizzling sounds, and an extremely sharp aura spread outward.

Undying Five Elements Sword Qi—Essence of Metal.

Of the five elements in sword energy, metal was the sharpest.

Channeling the Metal Sword Qi, Yang Kai’s fist became enveloped in countless sword rays—so fine that they were nearly invisible to the naked eye.

Sensing the terrifying power gathered at the tip of that fist, Jiang Xi naturally refused to sit and await death. Once more, he condensed five-colored poisonous smoke, shrouding his entire body within it.

The fist struck Jiang Xi. The five-colored smoke instantly disintegrated; the bloodlight that covered him burst apart, his protective Saint Yuan failed to hold, and the countless tiny sword flashes tore his body to pieces.

The sounds of bone shattering rang densely; Jiang Xi's body flew back and midair blood gushed from his mouth.

His ferocious face twisted into panic as he fought to control his form, but a Golden Blood Thread soon unfurled a blaze of golden light that completely engulfed him.

When the golden light dispersed, Jiang Xi's body suddenly shattered into countless fragments that fell from the sky.

Jiang Xi, famed on Chi Lan Star and someone who had qualified to ascend to the Void King Realm, had perished!

The group of Ice Heart Valley women flushed with excitement and erupted into cheers, overcome with emotion.

Yan Chilei, who was fiercely engaged with Yu Xueqing, turned pale and stared at Yang Kai in utter shock, his movements involuntarily slowing for a heartbeat.

Yu Xueqing was, after all, the Thirteenth Elder of Ice Heart Valley. Though her rank was low among the elders, her strength was formidable. She naturally wouldn’t let such a chance slip by—seizing the moment, she reversed the tide of battle and launched a fierce assault to suppress Yan Chilei.

She herself was shocked and had never expected Yang Kai could kill Jiang Xi.

After all, that man's cultivation method was fiendishly strange; even if she faced him she would certainly fall into the inferior position and might die if she was careless.

But Yang Kai had killed Jiang Xi, and it had taken him only twenty or thirty breaths of time.

Within Ice Heart Valley, perhaps only the Great Elder could accomplish such a feat.

This youth could actually be someone who could stand shoulder to shoulder with the Great Elder? Yu Xueqing's heart trembled and she felt compelled to reassess Yang Kai.

"Senior Brother, please lend a hand and assist the Thirteenth Elder!" cried the young matron of Ice Heart Valley to Yang Kai.

"No problem." Yang Kai nodded coolly, pointed a finger at Yan Chilei and commanded in a low voice, "Kill him!"

The Fire Bird shot straight at Yan Chilei.

Yan Chilei and Yu Xueqing were roughly evenly matched and could not best one another. But with the addition of the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, Yan Chilei was no match—he was beaten back step by step with no ability to strike back.

"Brat, I am an elder of the Fire Radiance Sect. If you dare attack me, you're dead! Stop now while you can, otherwise even if you flee to the ends of the earth the Fire Radiance Sect will not spare you!" Yan Chilei shouted in a rage, hoping Yang Kai would hesitate and refrain from joining forces with Yu Xueqing.
