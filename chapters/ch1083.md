## Chapter 1083 — Seems Quite Happy

After learning of the death of the three who had been sent out, Xue Yue said nothing; she merely stood up and walked toward her room.

"Lady Xue!" Halika stepped forward and barked, his voice low.

Xue Yue halted, turned her head, and looked at him coldly.

Halika involuntarily felt a surge of terror; staring into those star-bright eyes, he swallowed hard.

For some reason, he saw the shadow of Third Young Master Xue Yue in those eyes.

As the head of the Rainfall Star branch, Halika had naturally met Third Young Master Xue Yue and had experienced that young master's methods; he was far too familiar with that look—it was exactly how Third Young Master Xue Yue appeared when enraged.

Not caring to ponder why two people of different sexes could possess the same expression, Halika said in a deep voice, "Lady Xue, were Black Eagle and others killed by Brother Yang?"

"Yes." Xue Yue nodded lightly.

Halika, Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman all turned pale.

"How is that possible? Brother Yang only has the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; even if he can fight above his rank, at most he could deal with one person—three of them together, how could he be a match?" Lin Mufeng shook his head like a rattle, refusing to accept Xue Yue's words.

Those were three cultivators of the Saint King Realm, not of the Saint Realm; the matter was too baffling to believe.

"Then how do you think they died?" Xue Yue looked at Lin Mufeng indifferently; he did not know how to answer.

Halika, reading the atmosphere, asked cautiously, "Lady Xue, why did you seem so happy when you heard the news of Black Eagle and the others' deaths?"

"Was I?" Xue Yue's expression remained cold and indifferent.

Halika shook his head and did not press the matter further; if Black Eagle and the others died, it was because their strength was insufficient—no one's fault. After a moment, Halika asked, "Lady Xue, Yang Kai was your guard, yet he killed three from my branch—how should this be handled?"

"What other way? He's no longer my guard. From now on, when you see him, capture him alive for me; I want him to taste every torment of the mortal world!" Xue Yue ordered. Her voice was as frigid as the gale that howls through the Nine Nether Purgatory; hands folded behind her back, she walked away slowly.

The three left in the main hall looked at one another.

"It seems Lady Xue has set the matter aside," the middle-aged woman said, thoughtful.

"I don't quite understand—why were the two on such friendly terms a few days ago, and now in the blink of an eye they're enemies?" Halika asked with a face full of confusion.

"Young people's affairs... ah, we'd better not meddle. Since Lady Xue ordered it, we'll follow. Still, what a pity— that brat actually possesses such terrifying strength; had we recognized it earlier, we should have kept him and cultivated him properly."

Halika nodded vigorously, feeling it an enormous pity. For a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm to be able to kill three Saint King Realm warriors—such talent and power were rarer than phoenix feathers in the entire Star Domain.

If they encountered him again, they would only be able to follow Lady Xue's command and capture him alive.

...

The Star Domain was vast and boundless; the Starry Sky was dotted with twinkling stars, like countless beautiful eyes that seemed to speak, blinking without end.

Yang Kai had been wandering through the Star Domain for half a year.

Since leaving Rainfall Star, he had been heading toward the location of another cultivation star. The Star Chart dotted above his Sea of Consciousness provided him many conveniences; at the very least, he knew where his destination lay and would not lose his way in the Starry Sky.

For others, having a Star Shuttle fly in the Starry Sky for half a year would likely have led them to lose their bearings long ago.

But Yang Kai, who had mastered the Star Chart, had no such worry.

Distances between cultivation stars varied; some were short, a Star Shuttle could arrive in a month or two; others were extremely far, and even relying on a warship it would take years to traverse.

Yang Kai's destination was comparatively distant; although half a year had passed, by his estimate it would still take another three months to arrive.

Such was the sorrow of the poor: no funds to buy a warship, no manpower to crew it—relying only on the Star Shuttle in the Starry Sky was time-consuming.

Fortunately, Yang Kai did not waste those days.

The Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid was constantly helping Yang Kai draw in Spiritual Qi, though Spiritual Qi in the Starry Sky was scant—pathetically meager—so the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid's effect was limited.

During this period Yang Kai had been relying on Upper-Level Saint Crystals to replenish his consumption and to cultivate.

While cultivating, he also delved into alchemy; the books obtained from the Sect Elder had been read several times. The grades, effects, names and living properties of various Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine had been firmly memorized, and the spirit formation diagram that Zong Ao had devised had been thoroughly absorbed by Yang Kai.

After these studies, Yang Kai began to research the secrets of space.

His fight with those three Saint King Realm warriors had made him realize the subtle uses of spatial power.

The force of space applied to the Divine Sense Threads could allow the threads to break spatial constraints and advance in leaps, enabling them to probe farther, more secretive places while being difficult to detect; and even if discovered, others would find it impossible to trace Yang Kai's position back.

These matters Yang Kai had long since understood.

Now he also understood that spatial power could be applied to his Saint Yuan attacks.

In that battle, the Nine Heavens Divine Technique had relied on the secrets of space to break spatial constraints and launch a strange attack that left the enemy defenseless.

This inadvertent discovery sent his combat effectiveness soaring.

When he had been at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, fighting a First Stage of the Saint King Realm on Shuiyue Star had left him exhausted; now, killing three cultivators of the same level came with ease.

Such was the advantage of flexibly wielding spatial power.

Having tasted it, he naturally applied himself to its study with even greater zeal.

Along the way he had comprehended many mysteries; things that were once obscure suddenly became clear, and he eagerly honed his understanding of spatial power.

Since entering the Star Domain he had encountered many formidable experts, and had seen numerous masters who truly possessed great divine arts; he perceived the immense gap between himself and those people.

To take root in a place and survive, one's own strength was indispensable. Fortunately, he possessed many advantages others could scarcely match.

Divine Sense Fire, Demon God Golden Blood, a vast Saint Yuan reservoir, an aptitude tempered to its limit—these advantages convinced him that, given enough time, he could rise above others.

He had walked this path once before on the Tongxuan Continent, rising from obscurity to renown, from solitude to commanding legions; he was not unfamiliar with it. Now he simply retraced that road—though it might take longer, time was no great issue.

The Star Shuttle sped onward, and Yang Kai did not idle.

At one moment he suddenly opened his eyes, frowned, and looked sideways with a surprised expression.

A dozen or so cyan lights were rapidly approaching from that direction—each beam representing a Star Shuttle. They flew in close formation like a gale; at their head was a yao man with a pair of horns on his head. One could not tell which branch he belonged to; his beard was thick and luxuriant, giving him an extremely rugged appearance.

Around him gathered warriors of various races, each radiating the fluctuations of the Saint King Realm, clutching Secret Treasures of differing shapes, their gazes ice-cold.

Yang Kai had been lost in his own world; by the time he noticed them and sought to avoid them, it was already too late.

He had not expected to run into a group likewise piloting Star Shuttles in this vast Star Domain.

The dozen cyan lights closed in swiftly; before long they were beside Yang Kai, and one by one their eyes sized him up. Upon discovering Yang Kai was only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, their expressions shifted to contempt; several even pointed at him and laughed brazenly.

The leading yao man had naturally triangular serpent-eyes and held a silver spear; blue patterns flowed along the spear and waves of dense water-qi rolled from it.

His chill gaze swept over Yang Kai; his Divine Sense scanned him without restraint, as if to inspect Yang Kai from inside out.

Yang Kai's expression did not change; he remained seated on his Star Shuttle.

"Kid, have you seen anyone else pass through here?" the yao man asked, his voice like muted thunder exploding in Yang Kai's ears.

Yang Kai shook his head.

"You really didn't see anyone?" the yao man seemed unconvinced, regarding Yang Kai with suspicion. "That group clearly passed this way; we tracked them the whole way—how could you not have seen them? Did you take some benefit from them and now refuse to reveal their whereabouts?"

He clearly believed Yang Kai was lying.

Yang Kai shrugged. "You lot are the only living beings I've encountered these past months; before this I truly hadn't met anyone else."

His tone was amiable; he didn't want to provoke trouble for no reason—he only wished to reach his destination and rest on that cultivation star for a while.

Drifting in the Starry Sky forever was no pleasant thing; the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid's medicinal effect was nearly spent.

"Diji, this kid's nerve is extraordinary," a woman beside him suddenly remarked.

A cultivator at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, facing so many Saint King Realm figures without flinching, had to be either mad, recklessly bold, or backed by someone— the woman thought the second most likely.

The yao man called Diji nodded.

"That brat's smirking—one glance and you know he's no good. He definitely saw that group and deliberately isn't telling us," someone else interjected, eyes hostile and clearly itching to strike.

Diji stared coldly at Yang Kai; a faint light gleamed in his eyes, but he made no move.

"Why waste words? Kill him and let me search his spirit to see if he's lying," another yelled, impatience evident. "If you don't cooperate, don't blame us for being rude."

Yang Kai shot him a glance, chuckled softly, and a sliver of cold light flashed in the depths of his eyes.
