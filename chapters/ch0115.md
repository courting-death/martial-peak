## Chapter 115 — Collecting the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew

From the moment Wen Feichen struck Yang Kai with that palm, his defeat had already been sealed.

Yang Kai knew all too well that to slay such a formidable expert, unless he could restrict his freedom, there was little hope relying solely on the combined strength of himself and Xia Ningshang.

Long Hui possessed exquisite footwork, so how could Wen Feichen, a True Essence Realm master, lack such finesse? If he sensed danger and escaped, by dawn, both Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang would be doomed.

Yet, how arduous it was to restrain such a master! Even with his power now mostly sealed, it was far beyond Yang Kai’s ability to do so with ease.

Thus, Yang Kai could only risk his own life! Using his body as a shield, he bore the brunt of the attack, seizing that fleeting moment to bind his foe.

This was a grand stratagem—Yang Kai had even counted himself as a piece on this chessboard. How could Wen Feichen not fall into the trap?

With both hands destroyed, Wen Feichen was like a hedgehog stripped of its spines, possessing strength but utterly unable to wield it.

Amidst the rhythmic cries of agony and the cracking of bones, Wen Feichen endured what must have been the coldest and cruelest torture known to man at Yang Kai’s hands.

In mere dozens of breaths, Wen Feichen’s screams gradually faded to a whisper, his breathing shallow and irregular, his entire body collapsing like a heap of rotten mud upon the ground.

Xia Ningshang watched anxiously from the side, as if seeing her junior brother for the very first time.

Having observed him for over two years, she had never witnessed such madness, bloodthirstiness, and unruly ferocity in him.

Suddenly, three dark chains of Yin energy shot forth from Wen Feichen’s body. At the same time, five other chains scattered throughout the valley also flew out, vanishing into the void.

“Junior Brother, he’s dead!” Xia Ningshang gently tugged at Yang Kai.

The emergence of the Yin energy chains meant Wen Feichen’s life force was utterly extinguished.

“Dead?” Yang Kai panted heavily, slowly straightening his back.

“Junior Brother, are you alright?” Xia Ningshang’s voice trembled with concern. She sensed something amiss in him—an ominous aura filled his entire being, as if he were on the verge of losing control to demonic influences.

Yang Kai understood her worry and forced a grim smile. “Do not fret. This is one of my martial techniques. It only looks frightening.”

Xia Ningshang’s eyes reddened as she looked at him. Though his gaze was terrifying, a calmness simmered beneath it, and she finally exhaled in relief.

“All the enemies are dead. Let us retrieve that Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew!” Yang Kai reminded her, not forgetting their true purpose.

“Can you still manage? You are gravely wounded!”

“I can hold on a little longer. Soon, I might truly collapse.” Yang Kai grasped Xia Ningshang’s hand and hurried toward the source of the gathering Yin energy.

Night was fading, and the Yin energy within the valley was nearly depleted, likely absorbed by the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.

Upon arrival, the treasure remained undisturbed, unaffected by the fierce battles hundreds of zhang away.

At this moment, the flower bud was about to fully bloom. Within it, a drop of crystalline liquid emitted a faint, ethereal glow.

“How do we collect it?” Yang Kai asked.

Xia Ningshang whispered, “Bind it with your Yang attribute Primordial Qi, then... hold it in your mouth. I will handle the rest. Remember, do not let any other part of your body touch it.”

Hold it in the mouth? Yang Kai was puzzled. Just as he was about to inquire further, Xia Ningshang’s expression brightened. “It’s coming out!”

As she spoke, the enormous bud slowly opened. Though it was the darkest hour before dawn, the valley suddenly brightened as if bathed in daylight.

A drop of crystal-clear liquid, like dew, rose gently from the bud, spinning softly.

The petals cradling it transformed into dense Yin energy, merging into the liquid.

Like a precious gem—exquisite beyond compare—yet radiating a chilling Yin energy that sent shivers through anyone who beheld it.

The Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew!

Xia Ningshang’s hands moved swiftly, activating the Nine Yin Eight Lock Formation once more. The instant the dew appeared, the sound of chains whipping through the air echoed.

Eight chains of Yin energy materialized, driven by an unseen force. At Xia Ningshang’s soft command, they swiftly wrapped around the dew, sealing off the small space and imprisoning it completely.

The dew struggled fiercely but could not escape the five zhang radius.

“Junior Brother, it’s up to you now.” Xia Ningshang watched Yang Kai nervously. Though this trial had lessened her concern for the treasure, it was still a precious prize, and naturally, they must claim it.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and stepped steadily toward the sealed space.

The eight Yin chains were powerless against Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi, the bane of all Yin energies.

As he entered the small realm, the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew seemed to sense his intent, drifting at the furthest distance from him in midair.

Upon closer inspection, Yang Kai saw it truly resembled a gem, shaped like a drop of dew, barely larger than a thumbnail.

How to bind it with True Yang Yuan Qi? Yang Kai frowned, pondering briefly before summoning a drop of Yang Liquid.

The Yang Liquid appeared, and with a thought, a crimson net formed in his hand. He cast it over the dew.

The dew attempted to resist, darting left and right, evading Yang Kai’s first strike.

“Interesting!” Yang Kai grinned. Though he knew many heavenly treasures possessed their own consciousness, this was the first time he had encountered one so spirited.

A sentient treasure was always exceedingly precious.

Not wishing to waste time, Yang Kai summoned another drop of Yang Liquid in his other hand, again forming a large net.

“Let’s see how you escape this!” With a sweeping motion, the fiery net successfully ensnared the dew like catching a fish.

With a flick of his finger, the Yang Liquid net retracted, tightly enclosing the dew and silencing it completely.

Yang Kai dared not touch it directly but instead swallowed both the Yang Liquid and the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew together.

The liquid was icy cold, sending a bone-chilling chill through his mouth. Even with his cultivation of the True Yang Technique, he shivered involuntarily.

Yet the next moment, an unseen energy surged within him—stronger than True Yang Yuan Qi—immediately suppressing the cold.

Simultaneously, a fierce pulling sensation arose within his bones. The True Yang Technique activated involuntarily, drawing the dew’s energy into his bones.

Realizing this, Yang Kai’s expression changed. He hastily ceased the True Yang Technique, but in that brief moment, he felt the dew in his mouth shrink by half, while a coolness blossomed inside his bones before fading away.
