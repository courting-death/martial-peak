## Chapter 820 — Kill One To Warn the Rest

After letting them vent for a good while, Wu Jie finally said, “Do you two think that if I acted, I could turn the tide? You saw those attacks. Even with one more of me, it likely wouldn’t have made a difference.”

“At the very least we wouldn’t look this wretched!” Zhang Ao barked. “So many experts, yet we were beaten back by a snot‑nosed brat. It’s a humiliation beyond words!”

As he spoke, he slapped the arm of his chair hard, turning it to powder.

“That brat—I’ll make him wish for death!” Cao Guan spat, eyes nearly spitting fire.

After a few curses, their moods gradually calmed.

Cao Guan sighed leisurely. “In the end, we’re a pile of loose sand. If those forces could unite like Brother Zhang and I, how could we fail to take Nine Heavens Sacred Land?”

“Indeed.” Zhang Ao nodded. Earlier, while Poxuan Palace and War Soul Hall were fighting Yang Kai, the people they’d enticed over had mostly watched the show. Few actually helped. If they had stepped in, perhaps they would have broken the Nine Peaks barrier today.

“Palace Master, Palace Master—” An urgent shout sounded outside the tent, and with it a Poxuan Palace cultivator rushed in.

“What has you so flustered?” Already in a foul mood, Zhang Ao snarled at his subordinate’s lack of manners.

The cultivator’s expression changed. He hurriedly saluted. “Palace Master, some of the minor forces are preparing to leave.”

“Leave?” Zhang Ao’s lids lowered, a blade‑edge chill flashing in the depths of his eyes.

“Yes. They said they don’t want to be enemies with Nine Heavens Sacred Land and are heading home.”

“Ridiculous!” Cao Guan shot to his feet with a growl. “No one is allowed to leave!”

At a time like this, anyone who left would sap everyone else’s morale and only draw more people to go.

“It seems we should have a good talk with those who want to go,” Zhang Ao murmured coldly. As he spoke, he turned to look at Cao Guan and Wu Jie. “Well?”

“Just what I was thinking,” Cao Guan said with a firm nod.

Wu Jie only shrugged, looking indifferent.

With their views aligned, the three left together.

In another nearby tent, the people of the Duao Alliance were gathered in discussion.

Alliance Master Yun Cheng kept glancing at his daughter, thoughtful. Ever since they’d returned from the day’s battle, Yun Xuan had seemed absent‑minded, as if her spirit were wandering beyond the clouds. It only made Yun Cheng more certain that something had happened between his daughter and the new Saint Lord of Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

“Alliance Master,” Ji Yan said after listening for a bit to the commotion outside, “it sounds like the people of Xingluo Sect and Xuehan Pavilion want to leave.”

Yun Cheng nodded. “I heard the leaders of those two forces discussing it on the way back. To be frank, our losses under Saintess Nan weren’t heavy—only some ordinary disciples suffered. We really came to join the crowd and ask Nine Heavens Sacred Land for an explanation, not to become their enemies. And now that we’ve seen their depth, it’s only reasonable that they’d want to go.”

“Agreed,” Ji Yan said. “I’ve heard only a few forces suffered badly at Saintess Nan’s hands. The rest are like us. As for Zhang Ao and the others, their actions are… intriguing. They don’t seem to have lost anything, so are they just kicking someone when they’re down?”

Yun Cheng let out a cold laugh. “Their aims are certainly more than that. The Nine Peaks is a foundation grand enough to make anyone jealous. But I suspect their main goal is the new Saint Lord and the sole Saintess. If they can seize those two…”

Ji Yan’s eyes lit. He understood at once. “So that’s it. Their appetites are anything but small.”

“I didn’t think of it before today, but now I see it clearly. The forces dragged into this—including us—are just Zhang Ao and Cao Guan’s pawns. Ah… we’re still too weak. If we had a great patron, my Duao Alliance wouldn’t need to bow to Zhang Ao and Cao Guan’s whims.”

As he spoke, he glanced—intentionally or not—toward Yun Xuan. Seeing his daughter remain silent, Yun Cheng could only smile bitterly to himself.

He still cared very much whether his daughter had anything with that new Saint Lord.

“What should we do, then? Should we leave as well?” Ji Yan asked.

“Leave?” Yun Cheng snorted. “Do you think you can just walk away?”

“Hm?” Ji Yan started, his face changing. “Don’t tell me…”

“Exactly what you’re thinking.” Yun Cheng smiled faintly, then his brows knit. After probing for a moment, he said, “They’re here. Let’s go watch a show.”

He rose and strode out of the tent. The others hurried after him.

Outside, the warriors of Xingluo Sect and Xuehan Pavilion who were preparing to leave were blocked by Zhang Ao, Cao Guan, Wu Jie, and the rest. No one knew what they said, but after Zhang Ao exchanged a few words with the leaders of those two minor forces, a sudden change erupted.

Amid screams and howls, Zhang Ao, Cao Guan, and the others directly slaughtered everyone from the two small forces.

In less than ten breaths, over a hundred corpses carpeted the ground.

All onlookers were dumbstruck. Eyes trembling, they stared at the carnage, cold seeping into their bones.

Sweeping his gaze around, Zhang Ao declared in a ringing voice, “If you won’t avenge your kin and friends, fine—but to even think of throwing yourselves to Nine Heavens Sacred Land, to bring comfort to enemies and pain to your own? People like that have no right to live. I, Zhang, am ashamed to stand with them. I’ll repay the dead’s grudges on their behalf. Rest in peace.”

Cao Guan followed, “Everyone, be at ease. Nine Heavens Sacred Land is nothing but a late autumn locust—won’t be jumping for long. We’ll find a good plan. Next time we attack, success will be in the bag. Disperse for now and rest up. We’ll be counting on you in a few days!”

Listening to the two prattle, no one responded. Only now did everyone realize they’d likely stirred up serious trouble.

“Riding a tiger—no way down, heh.” Yun Cheng smiled and shook his head, self‑mockery in his eyes.

Many of the forces and experts lured here understood the situation as he did. But cowed by the strength of Zhang Ao, Cao Guan, and the others, who dared speak up?

Judging by what they’d done to Xingluo Sect and Xuehan Pavilion, if anyone went against their wishes, they would be the next to fall.

Gradually, the crowd dispersed, and people came to collect the bodies.

Back in the tent, Yun Cheng looked around, then froze. “Where is the young lady?”

Yun Xuan had been with them just now, but she was suddenly gone.

“Xinyu is missing too. They probably left for something,” Ji Yan answered.

Yun Cheng relaxed a little and asked no more.

In a patch of forest, Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu trailed a young man warily. They walked out of the gathering place and into a very remote area, but the young man didn’t stop; he kept heading outward.

“Hey, which force are you from, and what’s your name?” Ruan Xinyu’s patience was poor. After following for a while and hearing him say nothing—only leading her and Yun Xuan forward—she couldn’t help snapping.

The young man’s cultivation wasn’t high, so she felt emboldened and had no fear he could do anything to them.

“Ladies, I am Liu Gui, a disciple of War Soul Hall,” the young man replied quickly, his attitude not bad.

“War Soul Hall?” Ruan Xinyu’s brows knit. “Why did you call us out? What is this ‘big matter’ you mentioned?”

“Hehe, you’ll know when we get there. Don’t worry, I’m not a bad person,” Liu Gui said with a chuckle.

Ruan Xinyu snorted. “Hearing you say that makes it sound even more suspicious. If it’s such a big matter, why not report to your Hall Master? Why sneak us out? Be honest—what are you really after?”

“I’m not after anything,” Liu Gui said miserably. “I was entrusted by someone. He asked me to bring you—no, to bring this young lady over. You came along on your own.”

“Entrusted?” At that, Yun Xuan’s heart trembled for no reason, an inexplicable anticipation rising within her. She asked urgently, “Who entrusted you with this?”

Liu Gui hemmed and hawed for a while, then said helplessly, “Please don’t ask, miss. I have my difficulties and really can’t say. But rest assured—we’re almost there.”

Yun Xuan quickly looked ahead and sent her Divine Sense outward, but she saw nothing and sensed nothing either.

“Yun Xuan, I think this kid is suspicious. There might be a trap waiting ahead. We should go back,” Ruan Xinyu whispered at her side.

Yun Xuan pressed her lips into a smile. “It’s not as exaggerated as you say. He’s a War Soul Hall disciple. There’s no reason for him to do that.”

“Then why take you over there? There’s obviously some unspeakable agenda. Maybe he’s taken a fancy to your looks!”

“Don’t scare me…” Yun Xuan hastily clutched her clothes tighter.

“If you really don’t feel safe, restrain me first,” Liu Gui offered when he overheard their whispers. “If we do run into danger, my life and death will be up to you.”

“Good. Then I won’t be polite,” Ruan Xinyu said, acting at once. In a few swift moves she subdued Liu Gui and sealed his True Yuan.

Liu Gui looked unconcerned, utterly calm, and continued leading the way up front.

Seeing his manner, Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu relaxed somewhat.

They walked a dozen or so li to a small lakeside nearby before Liu Gui finally let out a breath. Pointing ahead, he said, “We’re here. He’s waiting for you over there.”

Following his finger, Ruan Xinyu couldn’t help covering her mouth with a gasp. Yun Xuan wore the same look of disbelief as her eyes bloomed with a different kind of light, staring dumbly ahead.
