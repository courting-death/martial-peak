## Chapter 189 — Insect King

“Didn’t you have some sort of relationship with that girl named Yu Aoqing… heh heh…” The Earth Demon chuckled lewdly. “The young master once said that if you were to be alone with any girl, this old servant would have to seal his Divine Sense. This old servant remembers it well.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, recalling that he had indeed said such a thing before, but he chose not to explain. Instead, he said, “I’m afraid I’m about to meet this so-called Insect King. I need to try to subdue it, so you stay nearby and keep watch.”

Upon hearing that Yang Kai was about to do something serious, the Earth Demon immediately became solemn. “This old servant obeys!”

Yang Kai surveyed his surroundings and found that the cave was quite spacious, but a foul stench lingered in the air. After searching for a while, he still could not find where the Insect King was hiding.

Instead, he discovered numerous withered bones and corpses scattered throughout the cave.

Zhang Yu, Miao Lin, and Luo Qianqian from the Yunxia Sect were all here. The three of them seemed to have suffered tremendous pain in their final moments, their eyes bulging, their flesh withered, resembling dried wood, and they looked extremely horrifying.

Zhang Yu was the first to die, and her condition was the most severe. Miao Lin was not much better off, while Luo Qianqian still had a bit of moisture left in her flesh, but it was barely a trace.

“Master… it seems the Insect King has drained their blood and flesh,” the Earth Demon said in a deep voice.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded slightly and squatted down in front of Luo Qianqian’s corpse. This Yunxia female disciple had been captured by the giant insect while she was with Miao Lin. Now, she lay completely naked, her once youthful and beautiful face now horrifying, truly a sight to lament.

Where was the Insect King?

Just as Yang Kai was on high alert, he noticed Luo Qianqian’s corpse seemed to twitch slightly. Suddenly, a golden light burst forth from her arm, shooting straight toward Yang Kai.

“Master, be careful!”

Yang Kai was already on guard, and although the event was sudden, he was not caught off guard. He circulated his True Yang Yuan Qi, and with a shift of his footwork, he appeared over ten zhang away.

However, before he could stabilize himself, he found that the golden light was following him closely, flying right in front of him.

So fast! Yang Kai’s expression changed, and he dodged again.

Just like before, the golden light flew toward him once more.

Yang Kai heard a faint buzzing sound, and within the golden light, he vaguely saw a figure resembling those strange insects, but it was countless times smaller.

Was this the Insect King?

Yang Kai had thought the Insect King would be a massive creature, but he never expected it to be so tiny. However, its speed was astonishing, and as the Insect King, it was undoubtedly more ferocious and troublesome than those strange insects.

Not daring to be negligent, Yang Kai used his footwork to maneuver around the cave, looking for an opportunity to strike.

After fifteen dodges, he was exhausted, and the Insect King remained like a parasite, not only failing to distance itself but actually getting closer.

With no way to evade any longer, Yang Kai steadied his stance, his expression grave, and punched toward the golden light.

The True Yang Yuan Qi erupted violently!

What shocked him was that this punch did not send the Insect King flying. Instead, Yang Kai felt a sharp pain in his fist, and the golden light vanished without a trace!

Quickly retracting his fist, Yang Kai looked down in horror. He discovered a small blood hole on his fist, and beneath the skin, there was a bulge that had burrowed into the back of his hand, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

“What kind of insect is this?” Yang Kai’s mind raced. He had intended to subdue the Insect King, but unexpectedly, he had suffered a significant loss in their first encounter, as it had burrowed into his body.

He hurriedly sat cross-legged, carefully sensing his body, but found no abnormalities. It was as if the insect had entered and suddenly vanished.

“Master, do you feel anything unusual?” the Earth Demon asked anxiously.

“Nothing,” Yang Kai replied, puzzled. Looking at the death conditions of the Yunxia disciples, the Insect King must have burrowed into their bodies to drain their blood and flesh. But why was he completely fine?

“Wait, take a closer look. This old servant suddenly remembers an ancient strange insect that resembles this one!” 

Yang Kai naturally understood that something was off and quickly immersed his mind, probing the arm where the Insect King had burrowed in.

After a long while, he finally discovered some traces.

The Insect King had actually burrowed into the star map space within his hand.

This star map space was opened up through the cultivation of the Mark of the Stars martial technique. Usually, this space accumulated Yuan Qi, ready to burst forth when needed.

According to the Earth Demon’s previous words, this martial technique was a one-shot deal; once unleashed, it was either you die or I die!

Last time in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, Yang Kai had relied on the Mark of the Stars to severely injure that Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast.

This strange Insect King could actually burrow into this space, and Yang Kai could clearly feel the vast Yuan Qi he had accumulated in the star map space over the past few months was being frantically devoured by it.

In just a short while, a quarter of it had already been consumed.

Once it burrowed inside, Yang Kai had no way to extract it unless he severed his wrist. Upon sharing this discovery with the Earth Demon, the latter became anxious.

“This is bad! If it consumes all this Yuan Qi, it will start to drain your blood and flesh! By then, you will definitely die, and if you die, this old servant will accompany you to the grave. What can we do?”

Yang Kai’s brows furrowed, his mind racing as he pondered a countermeasure.

He never expected this Insect King to be so bizarre, capable of devouring even Yuan Qi.

After a moment, the Yuan Qi in the star map space decreased significantly, and it was nearing depletion. Poor Yang Kai’s Mark of the Stars, which he had spent months accumulating, had not yet had a chance to unleash its power before being drained by the Insect King.

To prevent the Insect King from finishing off the Yuan Qi and then turning to his blood and flesh, Yang Kai quickly circulated the True Yang Technique, channeling the True Yang Yuan Qi from his meridians into the star map space.

The Insect King was devouring it with increasing delight.

Though this method was only a temporary fix, it could buy some time. Both Yang Kai and the Earth Demon were urgently brainstorming for a solution.

After a long time, Yang Kai suddenly asked, “Earth Demon, can you enter that star map space?”

The Earth Demon was taken aback. “This old servant has never tried, but even if I can enter, I’m not a match for that Insect King. Its speed is too fast, and… it might even devour my Divine Sense.”

If that were the case, then the Earth Demon would be walking into a trap.

“Try to see if you can get in!” Yang Kai urged.

“Do I really have to go in?” the Earth Demon asked, feeling anxious.

“Stop talking nonsense!”

With no other choice, the Earth Demon, despite his reluctance, faced the life-threatening situation alongside Yang Kai. Gritting his teeth, he wrapped the Soul-Breaking Spike and approached Yang Kai’s hand, murmuring a few words nervously before plunging into the star map space.

Moments later, the Earth Demon rushed out in a panic.

“It really can devour Divine Sense… this old servant is terrified!” If he hadn’t run fast just now, and if the Insect King hadn’t been busy devouring Yang Kai’s Yuan Qi, he would have surely met a grim fate.

“Now that you can enter, it’s easier to handle,” Yang Kai said with a grin.

“Does the young master have a plan?” The Earth Demon felt a glimmer of hope upon hearing this.

“There’s no guarantee of success; it’s just a trial!” Yang Kai said, then directly activated the Unyielding Will, crazily extracting energy from the Proud Bone Golden Body, while the Yang Liquid in his Dantian continuously erupted, transforming into massive waves of energy that poured into the star map space!

Within Yang Kai’s body, there were essentially three energy reservoirs.

One was the star map space on the back of his hand, which was the exclusive storage for the Mark of the Stars, and it held the least energy.

The second was the Yang Liquid in his Dantian, which was the foundation for Yang Kai’s combat prowess; all his martial techniques and moves relied on the Yang Liquid within his Dantian.

The third, and the largest reservoir, was the Proud Bone Golden Body! The Proud Bone Golden Body could accept any type of energy. All the pills he had consumed, the spirit herbs and fruits he had ingested, and everything he had cultivated, as long as it wasn’t Yang attribute, was stored here.

Thus, in terms of storage capacity, the energy within the Proud Bone Golden Body was many times greater than the total of the Yang Liquid in his Dantian.

At this moment, with both methods in play, the fluctuations of Yuan Qi surging within Yang Kai’s body were astonishing.

As the energy poured in, the Insect King in the star map space was devouring it with great relish, becoming increasingly intoxicated.

“Master, what are you trying to do…” the Earth Demon was stunned. “Are you trying to make it explode?”

“If it can explode, that would be best. If it can’t, you’ll have to go in and fight,” Yang Kai replied succinctly, then focused entirely on pouring energy into the star map space.

As time passed, the Insect King that had burrowed into the star map space began to feel a bit at a loss.

It had some level of intelligence; otherwise, it wouldn’t be able to command its subordinates to hunt prey. In the past, when it captured prey, it would first devour the various energies within the prey’s body, and after finishing the energy, it would then consume the flesh and blood.

But this time, it found something was off. The energy within this new prey was continuously flowing in, showing no signs of depletion. Although it had initially been overjoyed and had gorged itself, it soon felt its body swelling.

It was starting to feel full, yet the energy continued to pour in, flooding into its body, making it restless as it dashed around the star map space.

However, while it was easy to burrow in, escaping was not so simple.

Yang Kai had fought it before and knew its speed was astonishing. Once it gained freedom, it would be hard to capture again, so he naturally could not let it leave. The continuous influx of energy effectively sealed the exit, preventing it from escaping.

Yang Kai’s True Yang Technique was pushed to the limit, and the Yang Liquid in his Dantian had already exploded more than half, all poured into the star map space, and had been completely devoured by the Insect King.

From the back of his hand, a buzzing sound emerged, indicating that the Insect King was trying to escape.

With a cruel smile on his lips, Yang Kai unleashed a few more drops of Yang Liquid, along with energy extracted from the Proud Bone Golden Body, and sent it into the star map space.

The continuous explosions of Yang Liquid had turned Yang Kai’s blood and flesh crimson, his entire body radiating heat as if he were sitting under the blazing sun, and blood began to seep from his skin.

“Earth Demon!” Yang Kai felt it was about time and called out in his heart.

Seeing Yang Kai’s determination, the Earth Demon felt a surge of resolve and, without hesitation, wrapped the Soul-Breaking Spike and dove into the star map space.
