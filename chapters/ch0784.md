## Chapter 784 — Di Xiao

While Yang Kai observed his opponent, the man was also sizing him up, his gaze prowling as he weighed and examined him.

Though he could not see the face beneath the mask, he could clearly sense a dense, unmistakable killing aura from Yang Kai. Moreover, when faced with an opponent whose cultivation far surpassed his own, the eyes under that mask actually burned with a scorching will to fight.

Not a mediocre hand!

With just a light sweep of his senses, he immediately understood; a hint of caution flickered in the depths of his eyes.

With a gap in realm this large, yet the other still looked eager to try—there were only two explanations: arrogance, or confidence!

Someone who could string together more than a dozen victories in the Death Arena couldn’t possibly be the former. If he were, he would have died long ago. Did this human kid truly think that with a First Stage cultivation he could contend with him?

The man immediately found it interesting.

In the stands, as Yang Kai’s opponent walked out, murmurs rose from all sides. Many demon cultivators pointed toward him, their expressions a mix of shock and excitement, as if they had already recognized who he was.

“That’s Di Xiao, under Lord Gou Qiong, isn’t it?”

“It’s him. I went to Qingliao City before and saw that man there—he’s definitely Di Xiao!”

“Why would he show up in the Death Arena?”

“They say that among Lord Gou Qiong’s many experts, he’s number one below the Saint Realm—just one step shy of advancing to the Saint Realm.”

“With this human kid matched against Di Xiao, I’m afraid the outlook is grim. Di Xiao’s methods aren’t something an ordinary Transcendent can match. Under Lord Gou Qiong’s command he’s earned great military merit; I’ve heard he can even exchange blows with Saint Realm experts.”

“What a pity. After today, we probably won’t see this masked kid stirring things up in the Death Arena again.”

“It’s just a human—let him die. Let’s watch how Di Xiao takes him apart. This kid’s been rampant long enough. Do you think our demon race has no one?”

“Quite so. I rather like him, but he’s a human after all.”

Whispered voices drifted from all directions. Yang Kai raised an eyebrow; he hadn’t expected that today’s opponent actually carried some fame among the demons.

For Gou Qiong to send him against Yang Kai clearly showed how seriously he took this matter.

Di Xiao suddenly grinned. “Friend, though we’re not of the same race, I’ve heard you’ve defeated a dozen or more Second Stage Transcendent opponents in the Death Arena, each time clawing your way back from the brink. I admire men like you. If possible, I’d even like to befriend you. But I come on Lord Gou Qiong’s orders to take your life today—so don’t blame me later.”

Yang Kai’s brow twitched. He remained indifferent and silent.

“Then… let’s begin.” Di Xiao cupped his fist slightly, and the moment the words fell, his figure vanished like a ghost.

Yang Kai’s expression changed in a flash.

He retreated rapidly from his spot, in an instant more than ten zhang away. His fists clenched, True Yuan surged, and he drove a savage, direct punch down at the ground; world‑shaking force blasted straight into the depths below.

Boom—

The entire Death Arena trembled violently. The rippling shockwaves spread to the edges, only to be blocked by countless seals and barriers.

In a heartbeat a massive pit more than ten zhang deep appeared.

From within the massive pit, a thread of cold light flickered, as though tearing space itself; it leapt across the barrier of distance and, in an instant, arrived at Yang Kai’s chest.

Pfft—

Blood sprayed. Yang Kai let out a muffled groan and staggered back several steps, his gaze grave as he stared ahead.

A wound the size of a dragon’s eye had appeared on his chest, blood welling out and quickly soaking his clothes.

Cries of alarm erupted from all around; a trace of fear flashed in many eyes at Di Xiao’s overwhelming power.

Too fast. No one knew what movement technique Di Xiao had used—he disappeared from everyone’s sight and slipped into the ground. That casual strike was like lightning, unstoppable; Yang Kai was hit before he could even react.

Since appearing in the Death Arena, Yang Kai had fought more than a dozen times. Though each bout had been a narrow escape, never had any been as perilous as today—one strike, and he was wounded.

And it didn’t look light. His face went green then white; only after a long breath did it gradually steady.

Di Xiao still stood smiling not far away, watching Yang Kai as if he’d never moved at all. Yet between his brows there was a hint of dissatisfaction.

He’d thought that even if it didn’t kill Yang Kai, that blow would at least strip him of his combat strength—he hadn’t expected the other to withstand it.

This kid… is a bit strange. His flesh seemed exceptionally tough, dissolving the force of that strike invisibly.

“Impressive,” Di Xiao praised from the heart. “I didn’t expect there to be someone like you among humans.”

“You’re not bad either.”

“Again!” Di Xiao barked, giving Yang Kai no time to breathe. Tornados imbued with a destructive intent suddenly sprang up around him. Each one was immensely thick, shooting into the sky; the instant they appeared the Death Arena was cast into choking gloom.

The shattered stones on the ground were swept into them, making the tornados’ power grow ever more terrifying and condensed.

An unparalleled ominous killing intent spread from Di Xiao’s body, and those tornados turned pitch‑black at once.

At some unknown point, black clouds had gathered over the arena, covering the sky and pressing down a heavy atmosphere.

Blades of wind shot out from the tornados, peerlessly sharp and indestructible, colliding and showering sparks.

Swish, swish, swish—

In an instant, wind blades completely wrapped Yang Kai, leaving him with no path to the heavens and no door to the earth.

Yang Kai gave a low shout as the ground beneath his feet suddenly sank. A drop of Yang Liquid burst from his fingertips; with a sweep of his hand he condensed a shield overhead.

Wind blades surged in and engulfed him. The shield condensed from True Yang Yuan Qi constantly shifted shape, like a lone skiff amid stormy seas—always on the verge of destruction, yet never collapsing, protecting Yang Kai from those wind blades.

The demons in the stands cried out in unison, stunned.

With only a First Stage of the Transcendent Realm cultivation, Yang Kai still held out under Di Xiao’s Third Stage assaults without showing the slightest sign of defeat. It was hard for them to accept.

Di Xiao was no ordinary member of the demon race. He was a leading commander under Gou Qiong—one could almost say the number one below the Saint Realm across the entire demon race.

Even in the stands, those demon cultivators could feel the terror of Di Xiao’s power. Yet such strength still failed to break Yang Kai’s True Yuan shield—an outcome that surprised them.

“My lady, he really does have more potential to tap!” Yu Mo’s eyes lit up as he exclaimed softly. “In those previous bouts he hadn’t shown all his methods.”

Xueli’s beautiful eyes grew sinister. She said coldly, “Relying on True Yuan alone to block Di Xiao’s attacks—his True Yuan’s density and purity are in no way beneath Di Xiao’s. He’s good—very good.”

The cultivators at Xueli’s side all watched closely as well, their faces shocked.

Only An Ling’er wore a face full of sorrow and worry. Though Xueli’s mouth praised Yang Kai, An Ling’er still heard the woman’s wariness.

The more brilliantly Yang Kai performed, the more resolute Xueli became in killing him.

Yet if Yang Kai lost to Di Xiao, he would still die.

Either way, Yang Kai’s situation was exceedingly perilous. An Ling’er’s heart was in chaos; she didn’t know what to do.

“Interesting,” Di Xiao said, watching Yang Kai, who was resisting his attack not far away, more delighted than alarmed.

At first, he felt it beneath him that Lord Gou Qiong had sent him to kill human brat. Only after arriving in Sand City and hearing of Yang Kai’s many battle exploits did he finally feel that such a man was worthy of making a move himself.

Only worth it—he still hadn’t truly taken Yang Kai to heart.

But now, upon discovering that this human kid could truly fight back, Di Xiao grew excited at once.

He was the sort who relished battle, craving the baptism of blood, who liked to watch an opponent struggle stubbornly yet powerlessly in unwillingness.

In that moment, Di Xiao truly regarded Yang Kai as an opponent; his mindset shifted subtly.

The power surging from his body rose sharply in an instant.

The tornados howling around him roared like pitch‑black Jiao Dragons, fusing and condensing together into an even greater gale that swept across the entire Death Arena.

The surrounding seals and barriers were battered by that energy, sending up layer upon layer of ripples visible to the naked eye.

But those seals and barriers had been laid personally by Xueli. However capable Di Xiao was, he could not destroy them, so the demons in the stands felt little worry and continued pointing and cheering below.

Yang Kai was completely shrouded by wind blades and tornados.

The wind blades swept through like a plague of locusts, blotting out the sky and countless in number. Their keen aura seemed about to tear him apart, and the deathly breath among them made hearts quake.

Nowhere to run, no way to avoid.

Yet Yang Kai had no intention of dodging.

Crack, crack, crack—

The shield condensed from Yang Liquid did not last long beneath that ferocious assault; it shattered outright.

In the next instant, Yang Kai’s body was wrapped in countless wind blades. His clothes were rent and blood flew. In the span of a single breath, innumerable dense wounds opened across his flesh; the clothes on his body were sliced into strips, leaving him wretched.

Di Xiao smiled, looking at Yang Kai like a dead man, without the slightest emotional color.

In the next moment, Di Xiao’s smile froze on his face.

The Yang Kai who should have been killed slowly straightened his torso. With his head slightly bowed, he looked over with a sinister, venomous gaze, a hoarse chuckle rasping from his throat—eerie enough to make one’s scalp prickle.
