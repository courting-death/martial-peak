How many martial artists had there been in all of Fenglin City?

This time alone, Void King Realm and Origin Returning Realm cultivators who entered the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda numbered in the tens of thousands, not to mention those of lower realms; though there was no exact count, the total martial artists in Fenglin City—if not a million—still reached four to five hundred thousand.

If the six Emperors were to inspect them one by one—not to mention whether they had the inclination or energy—it would take an extremely long time.

Over such a long period, some unforeseen abnormality might occur.

Thus that method was completely unfeasible.

"Although we cannot be certain whether that Mu Xiao has been completely wiped out, rest assured—having lost so many wood seeds, even if it's not extinct its Yuan Qi is likely grievously harmed; it would be impossible for it to come out and wreak havoc in the short term. Simply order the city's martial artists to thoroughly check their conditions, and you can prevent disaster before it happens," Gao Xueting said calmly.

"We will obey Lady Gao's orders!" Duan Yuanshan knew there was no better plan and could only nod in agreement.

"All right, you may go; we have other matters to discuss," Xiao Yuyang said as he waved his hand.

Duan Yuanshan apologized once more and hurriedly withdrew, not daring to show the slightest disrespect.

Although this was his City Lord mansion, the Emperor Realm experts before him were of such standing that he could not provoke them; even meeting one privately was rare, and with six gathered together, how could he be insolent?

After Duan Yuanshan left, Xiao Yuyang suddenly waved his hand and an invisible force surged out, enveloping the room where the six sat.

Zeng Yuan, vice president of the Qiyao Commerce Guild, narrowed his eyes and asked in surprise, "Lord Xiao, what else do you have that requires such caution?"

"Could it be because of that Mu Xiao?" Lou Chi, vice president of the Ziyuan Commerce Guild, asked, astonished.

Xiao Yuyang smiled faintly. "Of course not—how could a mere Mu Xiao warrant this Lord's attention? What I'm about to discuss concerns the Shattered Star Sea."

"The Shattered Star Sea?"

At those words, the other five Emperor Realm could not help but change color slightly.

Feng Ming of Wuhua Hall said thoughtfully, "Does Lord Xiao mean... the entrance to the Shattered Star Sea is about to open?"

The others all looked at Xiao Yuyang with excited expressions, clearly very concerned about the Shattered Star Sea.

"Not long ago I received word from the Great Emperor: the entrance to the Shattered Star Sea is indeed about to open. As for the exact time, the Great Emperor cannot yet calculate it—only that it should be soon," Xiao Yuyang said with a solemn expression, gazing southward and cupping his fist slightly.

Everyone naturally knew exactly who he meant when he said 'the Great Emperor.'

In the entire Southern Territory, the one who could be called the Emperor was only one of the Ten Great Emperors—the helmsman of the Star God Palace, the Radiant Moon Great Emperor!

"If the Great Emperor says so, then we can hardly be mistaken," Gao Xueting nodded slightly. "Lord Xiao, have our sects all been notified of this?"

Xiao Yuyang smiled. "Junior Sister Gao, rest assured—the Great Emperor has already sent word to the sects you belong to. Since the Great Emperor has transmitted this and we happen to be gathered here, we might as well briefly discuss the matter."

"I see!" Chen Wenhao nodded. "Although we are all in the Southern Territory, we rarely gather like this; moreover, with the six major forces assembled, it's indeed a fine opportunity to discuss it."

"That is precisely the Great Emperor's intent, and it saves us having to arrange another meeting," Xiao Yuyang smiled. "As you all know, the birth of the Shattered Star Sea is closely tied to that Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. Back then he rampaged across the world, arrogant and unrestrained! He devoured all things of heaven and earth to strengthen himself; even the sun, moon, and stars could not escape him, and in the end he provoked the wrath of heaven and men and was rejected by the world."

"Ahem..." Feng Ming cleared his throat and said awkwardly, "Lord Xiao, we need not take those false reports the common folk believe too seriously, right?"

Xiao Yuyang chuckled. "Of course. Low-level martial artists think the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor fell because he was rejected by heaven and earth; those who know the truth are aware of what really happened. That battle shattered the cosmos, the heavens changed color, and the Shattered Star Sea was born—an independent realm. Unfortunately, although vast, the Shattered Star Sea can only accommodate up to the Dao Origin Realm; we are not fortunate enough to enter it. To rashly enter would risk collapsing the Shattered Star Sea. Inside there are many broken stars and numerous Stellar Origins; if one could absorb even one or two, it would greatly benefit us."

At these words, the other five Emperors were greatly tempted.

But very soon, they all sighed.

"Precisely for that reason, every time the Shattered Star Sea opens, Emperor Realm experts cannot enter; if not, we would have a fine place to go," Gao Xueting said.

"Junior Sister Gao, if you are willing, you could enter and try your luck," Feng Ming chuckled.

Gao Xueting snorted coldly. "The Great Emperor has decreed it; I do not wish to be slain by the Great Emperor's hand. Senior Brother Feng, if you do not value your life, be my guest and try."

Feng Ming was rebuffed, his face awkward, and he said no more.

"Although we cannot enter, our disciples can bring back Stellar Origins; why worry? If any of you wish to sell them, the Qiyao Commerce Guild will buy them all at any price!" Zeng Yuan smiled.

"That's what I wanted to say too. The Ziyuan Commerce Guild is sizable; we can afford to buy some Stellar Origins," Lou Chi quickly added.

The two vice presidents of the commerce guilds exchanged glances; though smiling, sparks flickered between them.

"You two are dreaming," Xiao Yuyang chuckled. "Enough—let's not speak of that yet. The exact opening time of the Shattered Star Sea is not fixed; isn't it too early to argue now? The opening of the Shattered Star Sea has always been a grand event in our Southern Territory; once news spreads, the other three territories will rush over. But the slots are limited each time. What we need to discuss now is the slots: which sect can send how many people in."

......

Inside the cave, all the seals had been lifted; the Xuan Realm Pearl lay on the ground, and Yang Kai had already entered the Small Xuan Realm.

He transplanted the various Spiritual Herbs and medicines he had obtained from the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda into his herb garden one by one.

He could only recognize a small portion of these Spiritual Herbs and medicines; most he did not know, nor did he know what effects they had.

Among them, several lingzhi constantly changed color; they had been his first gain from the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, collected from beneath that marsh. From the Spiritual Qi they emitted, they were clearly Dao Origin-Grade medicinal herbs and must be of considerable value.

Although he had not tended to them for so many days, the lingzhi remained full of vitality and adapted instantly after being transplanted into the herb garden.

After all, the herb garden in the Small Xuan Realm had five Earth Vein pearls concentrating Spiritual Qi and a vast amount of Heavy Earth; planting these Spiritual Herbs here was more suitable than planting them in the herb garden of any force.

He believed that in due course these Spiritual Herbs and medicines would grow robust and strong.

As for the five Golden Crystal Grass, Yang Kai knew what they were for, but to refine Golden Crystal Pills he still needed to procure other herbs; there was no rush, so he transplanted them into the garden as well.

Aside from these gains, there were also body materials from various demonic beasts.

Yang Kai did a bit of sorting and planned to take them out to sell after a few days.

In any case, he currently had no need to refine any Secret Treasure; these demonic beast materials were of no use to him and could better be exchanged for Source Crystals.

There was also a Dao Origin Fruit; Yang Kai took it out to look at for a while, then put it away again.

He was not overly eager for the Dao Origin Fruit, but since he had obtained it, it was an added boon; refined into a Dao Origin Pill it would help him advance more quickly to the Dao Origin Realm.

Of course, that would require that all the power within his body be converted into Origin Qi.

Next, Yang Kai took out a jade bottle and watched it with a solemn expression.

If one were to speak of the greatest gains from this entry into the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, aside from absorbing a large amount of shattered heaven-and-earth Laws on the third layer—which not only gave him an initial understanding of the Power of the Laws but also supplemented the Small Xuan Realm's Power of the Laws—this jade bottle was the other major prize.

This jade bottle was what he had obtained from the Dragon Ascension Altar on the first level.

The dozen or so treasures on the Dragon Ascension Altar were mostly fake, formed by illusion, but what was inside this jade bottle was real.

At the time he had used the World-Ending Demon Eye to see through the falsehood and confirm it.

While inspecting those dozen items on the Dragon Ascension Altar together with Duan Tianci and Zong Zijin, Yang Kai had quietly taken out another jade bottle and switched them.

At that moment everyone was immersed in disappointment and the anger of being tricked; almost no one noticed Yang Kai's small maneuver.

Only Qin Yu of the Qin Family seemed to have noticed.

Later she asked Yang Kai about it; he nearly thought she had truly discovered him, but after thinking it over he judged she had only suspected and could not be certain.

Yang Kai himself did not know what was contained in the jade bottle.

During those days in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda he had not taken it out to examine.

However... he vaguely guessed that whatever was in the bottle had something to do with a true dragon, for whether then or now the genuine dragon scale on his chest had been slightly warm, as if forming a strange resonance with whatever was inside the bottle.

He drew a breath, placed the jade bottle before his eyes, and slowly opened the lid.

At that moment, a strange change erupted.

A high, resonant dragon cry suddenly issued from the bottle; Yang Kai's face changed in alarm, and before he could investigate what was happening, a slender figure shot out of the bottle.

The small figure was about a finger's length, resembling a little snake.

It was burning with searing flames, wobbling its head as it shot straight upward.

Once freed from the bottle's confines, it flicked its tail and immediately seemed poised to flee.
