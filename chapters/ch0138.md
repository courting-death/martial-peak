## Chapter 138 — One Hammer Martial Technique

Although Yang Kai was tempted by the power of these martial techniques, he could never extinguish his humanity for them.

After switching between seven or eight techniques, the man’s face was filled with terror, while Yang Kai sneered repeatedly.

“Hero, all I know are these kinds of martial techniques, I’m truly not deceiving you.”

“If you have only this little value, what use do I have for you?” Yang Kai's voice was laced with a chilling coldness. From the martial techniques he had spoken of, Yang Kai already knew that this person must have been a notorious villain in his past life.

“Hero, please calm your anger. Let me think carefully; I’ve just awakened not long ago, and my memories are a bit muddled. Give me some time, I will definitely satisfy you.” 

“Opportunities are rare; you must seize it well!” 

“Yes, I will not disappoint you, Hero.”

Yang Kai ignored him further; the area was already sealed off, making it a perfect place to heal. As for that person, although he must have been a master and a great villain in life, he could not stir up any waves now, so Yang Kai had no need to worry.

He did not have good healing medicine by his side, but this minor injury should heal in no time.

Reaching into his robe, he took out the remaining Little Stone Man and began to circulate his Yuan Qi, feeling the way the golden lines inside it circulated, probing the secrets within the stone man.

Just having the Flame Yang Explosion was not enough; Yang Kai wanted to take advantage of this healing time to cultivate a second martial technique.

If he did not grow stronger, he would still be bullied once he went out.

The number of golden lines within this Little Stone Man was quite substantial, at least seventy or eighty, likely a Heaven-Grade martial technique, or even a Mystery-Grade one.

After spending a whole day, Yang Kai finally memorized the operation method of these golden lines. Just like the last Little Stone Man, once Yang Kai withdrew his Yuan Qi, it turned to powder.

During this day, the man’s face was deep in thought, trying to figure out what he could use to impress Yang Kai so that he could secure his own life. Although he had thought of some bargaining chips, without Yang Kai speaking, he did not dare to open his mouth, hiding in fear within the golden body.

Yang Kai paid him no mind, completely immersed in the martial techniques he had gleaned from the Little Stone Man.

With his eyes closed and legs crossed, he followed the routes of those golden lines, allowing his True Yang Yuan Qi to flow through his meridians.

After completing one cycle, Yang Kai found it was not like the situation when he obtained the Flame Yang Explosion. He did not feel any urge to unleash a technique. Instead, there was a faint twitch on the back of his hand.

Was the route incorrect? Yang Kai was puzzled.

Impossible; he was clearly circulating according to the method of the golden lines within the stone man. There was not the slightest deviation.

Circulating once more, the twitch on the back of his hand occurred again.

What was going on? Wasn’t this a martial technique? Why did he not feel the urge to unleash it? When he performed the Flame Yang Explosion, it was not like this.

What was the mystery behind this martial technique? Why was it different from the others?

After pondering for a moment and finding no answers, Yang Kai could only slowly feel it through practice.

Relaxing his mind, Yang Kai circulated his Yuan Qi again and again. With each cycle, the same reaction came from the back of his hand, and that pulsing sensation grew more pronounced and clearer, as if something was about to burst forth from his body.

He did not know how long had passed. Yang Kai had circulated his Yuan Qi for at least eight hundred cycles, and after one cycle, a sudden sharp pain shot through the back of his hand. At that moment, the feeling of being restrained broke free, surging out of his body.

Yang Kai abruptly opened his eyes and looked down at the back of his hand, only to find a pattern had appeared there.

This pattern was somewhat strange. After staring at it for a while, Yang Kai realized it resembled the starry sky at night, occupying a small portion of the back of his hand. The stars twinkled, and when he did not circulate his Yuan Qi, it did not seem remarkable. But once he did, the star map seemed to come alive, shining with points of light.

Moreover, Yang Kai distinctly felt that beneath this pattern, a space had been opened up within the flesh that he could not see.

When he circulated his Yuan Qi, it was stored within this space.

After trying for a long time, Yang Kai poured all of his Yuan Qi into the star map on the back of his hand, then casually pointed at the ground.

With this point, Yang Kai did not exert any force; if there was an ant beneath his finger, it would certainly not be killed.

However, when the Yuan Qi erupted from the star map on the back of his hand, the starlight at his fingertip surged, illuminating the cave as bright as day.

With a crack, Yang Kai's entire arm sank into the ground, and the earth trembled violently, dust raining down from the cave's ceiling.

Yang Kai could not help but be moved.

Although this point consumed all of his Yuan Qi at once, the destructive power it unleashed was far greater than an ordinary explosion—almost double the destructive force!

Yang Kai estimated that if he merely unleashed all his Yuan Qi without any embellishment, he could not achieve such results.

This martial technique was truly bizarre! Yang Kai furrowed his brow; he had begun to grasp a bit of its principle.

“Hero, Hero…” The voice from within him emerged, carrying a tone of flattery and caution.

Yang Kai frowned, contemplating his thoughts.

“Hero, I seem to know a bit about the martial technique you are cultivating; would you like me to share it with you?”

Without a response, the man’s face inside was extremely anxious. He was eager to demonstrate his value before Yang Kai, fearing that Yang Kai would refine him.

Although they had not known each other for long, the man’s face could tell that Yang Kai was very young, yet his will was firm, unlike ordinary people. Moreover, there was a hidden sinister air in his character, which frightened him.

After waiting for a long time, Yang Kai finally came back to his senses and spoke, “What do you know? Speak it out.”

As if receiving a great boon, the man’s face was filled with gratitude as he hurriedly said, “I do not know what martial technique you are cultivating, but in my memories, I seem to have seen a martial technique similar to this. When you cultivate it, a unique space will be opened in a certain part of your body, and the power this martial technique can unleash is related to how much Yuan Qi is stored within that space.”

“During ordinary times, Hero, you can pour your Yuan Qi into this space. When you need to use this technique, you can unleash the power of this martial technique. If used well, it can be immensely powerful; if used poorly, it will only be a laughingstock. The root of it all lies in how much Yuan Qi you pour into that space—more Yuan Qi means greater destruction. Less, and it would be no stronger than a child's punch.”

“However, this martial technique is a one-time deal, accumulating through diligent practice to exchange for that moment of explosion. It is also a life-saving technique.”

The man’s face quickly finished speaking and obediently closed his mouth.

A smile appeared on Yang Kai’s face; what he said was quite similar to what Yang Kai had discovered himself, but it was more comprehensive, clarifying some of the unclear points.

Accumulating through diligent practice to exchange for a moment of explosion? 

This was simply a martial technique tailor-made for him!

Yang Kai could not help but want to laugh out loud. While others needed to accumulate their Yuan Qi through hard training, did he need to?

“I will study this well; do not disturb me,” Yang Kai instructed him.

“Yes. That, Hero…”

“What you said holds little value; think carefully about your way out!” 

The man’s face suddenly felt bitter. Yang Kai’s demeanor was so seasoned and composed that it made him feel as if he were facing an old fox.

What kind of sin had he committed? Why did he want to seize this body?

While sighing and lamenting, the man’s face felt Yang Kai driving his Yuan Qi into that special space.

He poured it in quickly and recklessly, not caring whether this would harm himself.

The man’s face wanted to remind him to take it slow, as consuming Yuan Qi too quickly could also burden the body. But with a roll of his eyes, he swallowed his words.

Hmph. You told me not to disturb you; it’s not my fault for not reminding you.

Better hurry up; once you exhaust all your Primordial Qi, I’ll see if I can find a way to escape this cursed place. Kid, you’re still too naive.

If Yang Kai were to rely solely on cultivation to replenish his Primordial Qi, it would take at least three to five days to be full.

But he only spent two hours to pour all his Primordial Qi into the space beneath the star map on the back of his hand.

The man’s face felt this and nearly leaped with joy. He sensed that Yang Kai’s body was now extremely weak, with not a drop of Primordial Qi left in his meridians. This was a great opportunity for him to escape.

Just as he was about to act, he suddenly froze.

Because he discovered that the originally empty meridians within Yang Kai had, in an instant, become full again.

What the hell! What’s going on? The man’s face was nearly driven mad; this bizarre situation exceeded his understanding. He thought, could it be that after being sealed for so many years, his mind was unclear and he was hallucinating?

No, the previous sensation was so real; this kid’s Primordial Qi had clearly been completely exhausted. How could it be full again in the blink of an eye?

I must have seen it wrong! The man’s face comforted himself and then focused intently on observing Yang Kai’s actions.

Another two hours later, Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi disappeared completely once more, and the star map on the back of his hand began to rotate according to some inexplicable pattern.

The man’s face swore to his soul that this time he was absolutely not mistaken; this kid’s Primordial Qi had indeed been completely exhausted, not a bit left. After nearly two hours of observation, he was well aware of every strand of Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi.

It couldn’t be wrong; absolutely not!

But the next moment’s change left him dumbfounded, frozen in place.

The empty meridians were once again full.

It was as if the Primordial Qi within Yang Kai was inexhaustible and could be drawn endlessly.

The man’s face was shocked; although he could not remember many things, he still had the most basic common sense. No matter how high a person's strength, it was absolutely impossible to recover their lost Primordial Qi so quickly.

If everyone could do this, wouldn’t the world be in chaos?

What kind of cultivation technique was he practicing to have such a heaven-defying effect?

At this moment, the man’s face no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai; instead, he felt a sense of fear and dread.

With a meridian that would never run dry and an inexhaustible supply of Primordial Qi, how terrifying would this kid be once he grew up? He could unleash immensely powerful attacks without worrying about the consumption of Primordial Qi. A person’s combat power might be equivalent to that of ten, or even a hundred, or a thousand others!
