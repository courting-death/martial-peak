## Chapter 888 — Many People Have Come

"Elder, you're taking this too seriously; I didn't mean it that way..." Lü Qingjing hastily waved his hand, but hearing Xu Hui say that he felt considerably reassured.

Because even if the refinement failed, he would bear no risk. He secretly thought that coming to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land this time had indeed been the right decision.

Waiting anxiously, Lü Qingjing kept glancing toward the outside of the main hall.

Xu Hui said no more and silently sat to one side.

About half an hour later, Yang Kai returned outside the hall, striding in with a commanding, tiger-and-dragon gait.

Seeing him like that, Lü Qingjing and Xu Hui both brightened at once; they knew the Soul Condensing Pill must have been successfully refined.

"Saint Lord Yang..." Lü Qingjing pursed his dry lips and called out softly, still uneasy.

Yang Kai gave a chuckle and said offhandedly, "I did not disappoint your trust—the refinement succeeded, though there was a small mishap."

"A mishap?" Lü Qingjing's face tightened; he didn't know what Yang Kai meant.

"See for yourself—you should be pleased." Yang Kai handed over a jade vial.

Lü Qingjing hurriedly took it and uncorked the vial; in an instant a clear fragrance rushed out, bringing a sudden, enlightening sensation that soothed his body and mind.

"Eh?" Xu Hui exclaimed in surprise and craned his neck to look; he felt that the medicinal potency in this Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill seemed a little unusual.

It was far more concentrated than an ordinary Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill.

Peering through the vial's mouth, Lü Qingjing's eyes widened; the large hand holding the jade vial trembled as he cried, "This is..."

"Pill patterns?" Xu Hui shouted.

They exchanged a glance and both saw shock mirrored in the other's eyes.

A Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill born with pill patterns is essentially no less valuable than a Saint Pill!

As if still unable to believe it, Lü Qingjing hurriedly tipped the pill out of the jade vial and placed it in his palm to inspect it closely.

The Soul Condensing Pill was plump and smooth, its interior containing pure medicinal efficacy; delicate pill patterns covered its body like human meridians, flashing faint glows.

Warm to the touch, Lü Qingjing was instantly certain: this pill had been freshly refined.

"Saint Lord Yang... this..." Lü Qingjing stammered incoherently; he had thought success alone would be a stroke of luck, yet instead he held a Soul Condensing Pill born with pill patterns!

It far exceeded his expectations and left him too excited for words.

"Lucky—pill patterns formed," Yang Kai chuckled casually.

"Now my son is saved!" Lü Qingjing cried out, tears glinting at the corners of his eyes.

"It's more than just saving him. Have your son take it; not only can it repair his damaged spirit, it may even give him unexpected improvements... If your son's realm is low, you'll need to assist him with protective measures—this Spirit pill's efficacy rivals a Saint Pill. Use it with care!"

"What the Saint Lord says is true; I will keep it in mind!" Lü Qingjing cried with delirious joy, his face radiant as if he already saw his son recovered and his divine sense strengthened.

"Congratulations, Brother Lü," Xu Hui offered from the side.

"Thank you, Elder; thank you, Elder; thank you, Saint Lord..." Lü Qingjing kept bowing and kowtowing in gratitude.

After a moment his expression turned awkward. Embarrassed, he said, "Before I came here I only prepared payment worth a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill; I never expected this Spirit pill would develop pill patterns..."

His face suddenly grew serious. He said in a low voice, "If Saint Lord Yang and Elder trust me, once my son takes this Spirit pill I will certainly raise sufficient rewards and return to pay my respects to you both!"

As he spoke he produced the payment he had prepared.

As expected, they were a collection of crystal stones.

Xu Hui looked to Yang Kai with a questioning gaze.

Yang Kai laughed brightly and said lightly, "You are the first to come to my Nine Heavens Sacred Land requesting pill refinement—how about we strike a deal?"

Lü Qingjing straightened and said solemnly, "Saint Lord Yang, command me as you wish; I will do everything within my power and will not refuse."

"It's not a big matter. I don't need the payment; consider this Spirit pill a gift to you..."

"Ah?" Lü Qingjing was taken aback.

Xu Hui was puzzled by Yang Kai's generosity, but his eyes shifted as if he guessed something, and he smiled faintly.

"I have one condition and I hope you'll agree," Yang Kai said without beating around the bush. "When you leave my Nine Heavens Sacred Land, help spread the word: say that a pillmaster in my Sacred Land refined a Spirit pill for you that bore pill patterns. How about that?"

"Just that?"

"Just that!"

Lü Qingjing replied solemnly, "I cannot refuse such a duty! Rest assured, Saint Lord Yang and Elder, I will do my utmost to spread the news."

"That's settled—hurry back; your son still needs this Spirit pill to save him," Yang Kai waved his hand.

Lü Qingjing left in tears of gratitude, offering profuse thanks.

Watching him depart, Xu Hui sighed, "A promising start!"

"Yes—it's a start that took a month to arrive," Yang Kai nodded.

"But this deal is a loss—Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pills with pill patterns are rare everywhere. If sold, it would fetch a great number of crystal stones," Xu Hui said with some regret.

Soul Condensing Pills are relatively high-end soul-repairing medicines; many warriors require them because in battle the spirit can easily be damaged, and when that happens pills are needed for repair.

One could say that Spirit pill would have no trouble selling; on the contrary, it would attract a swarm of buyers.

"Don't be so short-sighted..." Yang Kai chuckled. "If this news spreads, it will draw many people."

"Indeed—Saint Lord, you have long-term vision; I admire you," Xu Hui said.

"Spare me the flattery!" Yang Kai snorted.

Xu Hui chuckled and asked quietly, "Saint Lord... those pill patterns, were they really just luck?"

"What do you think?" Yang Kai shot him a glance.

"If the Saint Lord says so, then so be it," Xu Hui answered, not pressing the matter further, though his curiosity about the identity of the pillmaster hidden in the Sacred Land deepened.

That such a pill could be refined in only half an hour—his skill was astonishing.

Xu Hui had wandered the Martial World for years and knew many skilled pillmasters, even several Saint-grade masters, but he felt none of those famed masters could match this level.

Who on earth was it?

Xu Hui was utterly puzzled.

Five days later another person came to the Sacred Land to request pill refinement; when Xu Hui inquired he learned the man had heard of Lü Qingjing's plight and came to try his luck.

His aim matched Lü Qingjing's curiously—he too requested a Spirit-Realm Upper-Level pill.

But it wasn't a Soul Condensing Pill; it was a life-preserving Chi Xue Pill.

Xu Hui led him into the Sacred Land, and Yang Kai took the medicinal materials he had brought.

After the same half-hour, a Spirit pill was produced.

The man left in great excitement.

This time Yang Kai likewise accepted no payment and let him take the Spirit pill under the same conditions as with Lü Qingjing.

Three days later a third petitioner arrived at the Sacred Land.

Yang Kai applied the same method and even produced pill patterns, which thrilled the petitioner, who shouted that he had never seen such a high-grade pill with patterns.

He departed fully satisfied.

......

On that day Yang Kai was on the mountain where the Ancient Demon Clan lived, discussing matters with Li Rong.

From afar came the rustle of robes approaching rapidly; looking up, they saw Elder Xu rushing over, and before he arrived he called out excitedly, "Saint Lord, more people have come to request pill refinement!"

"They've come—why the excitement?" Yang Kai said, exasperated.

Li Rong at his side couldn't help but purse her lips and smile softly.

"There are quite a few this time—four or five at once... and two of them are Saint-Realm experts. It seems they intend to request Saint Pill refinements," Xu Hui reported anxiously.

"Oh? Finally, someone wants Saint Pills?" Yang Kai grinned.

He had refined three pills free of charge, all Spirit-Grade Upper-Level. Two of them even developed pill patterns, and with that news spread, it naturally drew people.

"Are they arranged in the guest hall?"

"Yes," Xu Hui nodded.

"Go take a look," Yang Kai said with a slight smile, instructed Li Rong, and then flew to the guest hall with Xu Hui.

Inside the guest hall five warriors sat upright in chairs, each with a cup of fragrant tea.

The five varied in strength and gender: two at the First Stage of the Saint Realm, one at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, and two at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

While waiting they appraised one another as strangers, except the two First-Stage Saint Realm experts who exchanged a smile as if they had met before.

One of them said, "Brother Wen, you also came to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?"

The man called Brother Wen smiled calmly: "Of course—the purpose is the same as Brother Shangguan's."

"So Brother Wen also came because he heard the news and wanted to try?"

"Of course. It's said three people came here needing Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pills; two took away Spirit pills with pill patterns, and the other received a Spirit pill with concentrated efficacy and high quality—though it lacked patterns, it was better than most pillmasters' work. If true, perhaps the pillmaster here can meet my requirements!"

"The news isn't false..." A middle-aged woman among the three listeners suddenly interjected.

The two Saint-Realm experts turned their gaze to her and asked suspiciously, "How do you know?"

"Because the third person who came to request a pill was my senior brother," the woman said with a pursed smile. "I even saw that Spirit pill with pill patterns myself."

The other four in the hall were struck and quickly asked for details.

The middle-aged woman did not hold back and recounted everything she knew in turn.

After hearing, the two Saint-Realm experts exchanged looks, and the warrior surnamed Wen pondered: "So it seems there really is a pillmaster of extraordinary skill hidden here?"

"Three Spirit pills, two of them with pill patterns—if it wasn't merely luck then it's peerless skill; I don't know which. Can he refine the Saint Pill I seek?"
