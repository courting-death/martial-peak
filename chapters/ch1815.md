## Chapter 1815 — Incarnation Mobilized

Strike while he’s down, and take his life!

Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor were both so cunning that they would not let such a golden opportunity slip; they immediately unleashed heaven-defying methods together, raining down on Zi Long as his momentum abruptly collapsed.

Countless Moon Blades flew in unison, and a mass of ghost-heads surged forward, directly devouring the place where Zi Long stood.

Fierce sounds of energy colliding erupted from within.

Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor stared unblinking ahead, their faces gradually growing grave.

After a long while, the earth-shattering commotion finally subsided, and the figure of Zi Long reappeared.

At this moment, the Purple Star master looked utterly listless, as if his Yuan Qi had suffered grievous injury; he was in an extremely wretched state, yet there was no fear for his life, for a purple-red suit of armor had inexplicably materialized on him.

The armor's radiance flowed and pulsed, giving off extremely intense Secret Treasure fluctuations; it was plainly not an ordinary item.

An armor that could withstand a combined strike from Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor had to be at least Void King-Grade Middle-Level in tier!

Defensive Secret Treasures of that grade were as rare as phoenix feathers across the entire Star Domain; one could say they were priceless. Even Kong Fa's Huangming Bell was only a Void King-Grade Lower-Level defensive Secret Treasure, a world apart from the value of Zi Long's armor.

Although his life was not in danger, the purple-red armor had cracked in many places, and a look of sorrow flashed through Zi Long's eyes.

This purple-red armor had been a treasure passed down through generations of the Purple Star, with each Purple Star master personally keeping it; it had endured tens of thousands of years, witnessing the changing tides of history and the countless rises and falls of the Purple Star.

But today it had been damaged, and the harm was extremely severe.

The armor was a Secret Treasure left from the ancient age; with the current artificers' methods and obtainable materials, repairing it was simply impossible — how could Zi Long not be heartbroken?

However, that strike jolted Zi Long’s mind clear. A moment ago, rage over his son’s death had clouded his reason—his blood had surged to his head, and all he could think of was killing Yang Kai to avenge him. In doing so, he’d misjudged the situation and suffered a heavy loss.

Now he understood that by his own strength alone, there was no way he could kill Yang Kai.

Not to mention Yang Kai's mastery of Spatial Force that allowed him to escape if beaten, the combined force of Ghost Ancestor and Yang Kai alone was enough to restrain him; if things went badly, he might lose his life here.

Thus Zi Long had already formed the thought of retreating.

A gentleman may wait ten years for vengeance; besides, his son's soul was already sealed in his Soul-Fixing Bowl. Once back on the Purple Star, he only needed to gather the materials to recreate his fleshly body, and then he could marshal the entire Purple Star's strength to encircle and eliminate Yang Kai!

With that thought, Zi Long drew a deep breath and coldly said, "Kid, I hope that when we meet again next time, you can still be this rampant!"

"Want to run?" Ghost Ancestor's face changed, "Wishful thinking!"

As he spoke, the wails of ghosts rose from the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, forming a black curtain that covered toward Zi Long.

"If I wish to leave, none of you can stop me!" Zi Long's expression did not alter; he formed a hand seal, his whole being transforming into a purple streak that, in an instant, broke through the Ten Thousand Souls Banner's shroud and shot toward the depths of the Star Domain.

Yang Kai watched the direction in which he fled, lifted an eyebrow, and the corner of his mouth curved in a gloating smile.

"Yang Kai, this guy is trying to run — aren't you going after him?" Ghost Ancestor grew anxious seeing Yang Kai remain motionless. "Letting him go will leave endless trouble!"

“If he’d fled in another direction, I might’ve had to put in some effort to chase him. But running this way…” Yang Kai’s expression turned oddly amused. “He’s just digging his own grave.”

"What do you mean?" Ghost Ancestor was baffled; he had no idea what Yang Kai meant.

But the next moment his eyes bulged, for he saw a sight that chilled him to the bone.

From somewhere in that Star Domain a gigantic palm suddenly and eerily appeared without warning, as if it had reached out from the void, and the spot where it emerged was precisely where Yang Kai had once walked out from the Floating Continent!

What kind of palm was that? It was as large as a house, and though it appeared utterly ordinary, it flowed with a mysterious profundity—an essence even the Ghost Ancestor, at his level, could not fathom. It belonged to a realm far beyond what a Void King Realm cultivator could ever touch.

The palm swung and covered Zi Long; it looked unbelievably slow, yet the force it carried made the void itself unstable.

Zi Long was filled with consternation; wounded as he was, he only wanted to leave, so how could he have expected such a giant hand to block his path?

Feeling the terrifying force waves from the giant palm, Zi Long did not dare slacken and frantically urged his power, invoking the might of his Domain to try to resist.

To his horror, the moment his Domain was unleashed it was torn to shreds, like a mirage, and the giant palm continued toward him without losing speed.

As casually as one might swat a fly.

Zi Long was so frightened his soul nearly fled; the already-broken purple-red armor flared with dazzling purple-red light, and a dense layer of Saint Yuan protection appeared about his body.

Boom...

The giant palm struck Zi Long, and in the next moment he was sent flying like a torn sack, bleeding profusely in the void, his body carving out brilliant sparks.

"Hiss..." Ghost Ancestor drew in a cold breath; although he had guessed the might of that palm was great, he still found himself underestimating it.

The strike seemed plain, but its power was unsurpassed!

What on earth was this thing? A palm that large — then where was its true body?

Before that thought finished, Ghost Ancestor got his answer as the palm's owner suddenly stepped out from the void.

Ghost Ancestor froze, then stared blankly at the palm's owner and then at Yang Kai, and blurted, "Is this fellow your brother? Or your son?"

He discovered that the palm's owner was a stone giant thirty zhang tall, yet the stone giant's features bore a resemblance to Yang Kai himself, especially in the features that shared the same expression.

"Grand Elder, can you not joke like that?" Yang Kai shot a deadpan look.

"What in the world is this?" Ghost Ancestor was nearly mad — he did not recognize what the stone giant was, but he was certain Yang Kai had not had it months ago, otherwise he would not have fled then.

Who could contend with such a massive, towering stone giant?

"An Incarnation!" Yang Kai answered in a deep voice.

"Incarnation?" Ghost Ancestor frowned, then his expression turned to astonishment. "The rumored external avatar? The one you used in the Medicine Valley? You actually mastered such an earth-shattering secret art?"

No wonder the stone giant resembled Yang Kai — it was Yang Kai's Incarnation. Generally, a warrior's Incarnation was identical to the original, inheriting part of the host's strength, character, and thought, acting under the host's will.

But this Yang Kai Incarnation... wasn't it a little bizarre?

"Yang Kai..." Ghost Ancestor's eyes suddenly shone warmly as he awkwardly looked at Yang Kai.

"Let's kill this fellow first, then you can ask." Yang Kai seemed to know what he wanted to ask.

"Good!" Ghost Ancestor nodded fiercely.

Yang Kai grinned, his gaze coldly fixed on the blood-coughing Zi Long not far off, his killing intent like a tide.

After taking the Incarnation's blow, Zi Long's purple-red armor had been utterly shattered; though it had been a Void King-Grade Middle-Level defensive Secret Treasure, after the combined strike from him and Ghost Ancestor it had already been damaged, and the Incarnation's follow-up blow left nothing to preserve.

The Incarnation had been formed by devouring and refining an entire Floating Continent — in other words, the present Incarnation was the Floating Continent.

That blow was an attack of the entire continent, suffused with the Law power of the Floating Continent.

No matter how strong a warrior was, how could he contend with a landmass two or three hundred thousand li across?

That kind of power and law enveloping it— even Xiaoxiao, of the same Stone Puppet clan, couldn’t hope to come close!

That Zi Long had not died on the spot already testified to his profound strength.

But now he was undoubtedly at the end of his tether.

Yang Kai did not take it lightly; a veteran Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert like Zi Long might yet have a trump card, so with a flick of his hand the Stone Puppet and the Fire Bird leaped out.

"Kill him!" Yang Kai pointed forward.

The Stone Puppet and Fire Bird obeyed and immediately pounced ahead.

Midway, Xiaoxiao had transformed into a stone giant of ten zhang, but that ten-zhang stone giant was like a child compared to the Incarnation — a father and son in contrast.

Liu Yan took the shape of the Fire Bird, purple-red colors swirling about her, bearing the twin might of thunder and flame that sealed off a vast swath of space.

The Incarnation moved its massive body and steadily walked toward Zi Long.

But that thing was so huge it was awkward in movement, which was why Yang Kai had not released it initially: the Incarnation was powerful but not agile.

So Yang Kai had kept it hidden in the void to strike at the opportune moment; he had not expected Zi Long to pass right by the Incarnation while fleeing — Zi Long's misfortune made even Yang Kai's heart clench.

Had Zi Long fled in another direction, Yang Kai might have had to give chase desperately; though he could have caught up, it would not have been as easy as now.

In the blink of an eye, Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan leapt above Zi Long's head; Xiaoxiao gripped the Heaven-Shaking Pillar and roared, slamming it down with ferocity, while Liu Yan opened her mouth and spat a lightning-shaped Blazing Flame that burned the void and enveloped Zi Long.

Despair showed in Zi Long's eyes.

As Yang Kai had observed, after successive fierce assaults he was at the end of his rope; any Void King Realm might have been enough to end him. Moreover, the combined strike of Xiaoxiao and the Fire Bird, with Yang Kai, Ghost Ancestor, and the Incarnation bearing down nearby, left no escape.
