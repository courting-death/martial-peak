## Chapter 1731 — The Mystery Beneath the Earth

When Yang Kai appeared in the Hundred Flowers Garden, Ye Xijun, who had been instructing the little girl Lin Yun'er in martial skill, froze for a long moment before coming to her senses and looked at Yang Kai with suspicion, asking, "Sect Master, why did you return so soon? Did you encounter some danger?"

After all, the last time Yang Kai had left Dark Star it had cost him seven or eight years to return, and from the mouths of people like Yang Xiuzhu she had also learned how remote Dark Star was—simply the time spent on the road would already take several years.

But now, it had been only a little over a year since Yang Kai had departed Dark Star.

How could he be back at this time?

"I discovered a mining star," Yang Kai replied succinctly, answering Ye Xijun while sweeping his divine sense over Lin Yun'er.

He was shocked to find that this naturally gifted little girl, who was only fourteen or fifteen and possessed the Force Tyrant Body, had qi and blood power within her that was comparable to an Origin Returning Realm veteran who had lived for centuries!

Her small frame looked delicate, yet every movement she made contained a force that was hard to ignore.

Compared to the last time Yang Kai had seen her outside Haicheng City of Qiantian Sect, Lin Yun'er had grown by more than a little: her body had stretched slightly, her small chest was firm and perky, her legs were long, and a lock of hair was casually bound behind her head, giving her a dashing, spirited look.

Seeing Yang Kai looking at her, Lin Yun'er obediently called him "Sect Master Uncle."

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

"A mining star?" Ye Xijun's eyes brightened.

Although she had always lived on Dark Star and could not feel the wonders of the Star Domain, that did not mean Ye Xijun did not know what the words "mining star" implied.

It meant wealth, strength, development, and a vast future!

Especially for a sect.

"A rich mining star?" Ye Xijun asked with interest.

“It’s incredibly rich — richer than you can possibly imagine!” Yang Kai replied in a deep voice. “I only explored there for a month and discovered eight mineral veins of varying abundance, including Annihilation Crystal Veins, Phoenix Tear Azure Iron, Heavenly Hook Jade, Piercing-Mountain Ice Copper, Water Cloud Steel, and even Saint Crystal Veins!”

"So many?" Even the steady-tempered Ye Xijun could not help being stunned by the news Yang Kai brought back; her fine brows lifted slightly and her long lashes trembled.

"And that's only the tip of the iceberg!" Yang Kai shook his head.

"Is it dangerous there?"

"Not dangerous. It's just a dead star without Spiritual Qi!" Yang Kai laughed. "If it were dangerous, I wouldn't have made a special trip back. I searched there for a month—there wasn't even a single living creature to be seen, let alone danger."

"So what you mean is…" Ye Xijun looked at Yang Kai with bright eyes.

"Of course we will mobilize the whole sect to mine it!" Yang Kai grinned. "But the place is too big; Lingxiao Sect alone won't be able to handle it all. Pick a few reliable sects we've cooperated well with recently and let them take a share of the spoils."

"Since it is the Sect Master's order, I naturally will not resist. However… although a few sects have cooperated well with us and generally defer to us, these benefits cannot be given away for nothing; let them pay thirty or forty percent of what they extract to Lingxiao Sect, and besides, we should wait until we've established our footing there before inviting them."

"That will do; Great Elder, your considerations are thorough." Yang Kai nodded. "But Yingyue Hall…"

"Yingyue Hall is naturally not among them!" Ye Xijun pursed her lips and smiled; she knew the friendship between Yang Kai and Qian Tong was not something that could be measured by profit.

"Fine, then you handle this matter. I'll refine some special Teleportation Tokens." After saying this, Yang Kai immediately left.

Because this time many people would be taken to the mining star to extract ores, the Teleportation Tokens had to be specially refined.

Yang Kai spent some time and refined fifty special Teleportation Tokens.

These tokens were different from the previous ones: each could guarantee the safe passage of fifty people through the Space Array Yang Kai had set, and when the tokens were being forged Yang Kai had Ye Xijun seal a restriction inside them with her Saint Yuan—so anyone who wanted to use a token had to have Ye Xijun pour Saint Yuan into it to remove the restriction before it could be used.

Although the method of use was a bit cumbersome, it ensured safety and also guaranteed that if a token fell into an enemy's hands they could not use it.

Anyone who wanted to use a Teleportation Token had to get Ye Xijun's consent first!

Forging these special tokens cost Yang Kai a fair amount of time; ten days later he completed them.

He had wanted to go see Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, but to his surprise both of them had already entered seclusion.

With no choice left, he gave up for the time being; once he had completed laying out the Space Arrays that would connect the Star Domain, he could return at any time—matters of mutual affection could wait.

Qian Tong led the elite forces of Yingyue Hall to Lingxiao Sect.

He was clearly very interested in the news Ye Xijun had relayed, so this trip he mustered a full one thousand disciples, which was quite a number for Yingyue Hall when they were recuperating.

After arriving at Lingxiao Sect and hearing Yang Kai's detailed account of the situation on that dead star, Qian Tong could not help but say eagerly, "What are we waiting for? Let's go at once—so many rare ores; if we can mine them out, it will be hard for our two families not to get rich."

"Elder Qian wants to leave Dark Star quickly, does he?" Yang Kai looked at him with a faint smile.

Qian Tong was taken aback for a moment and then laughed heartily: "Indeed. Lately I've been struck by lightning again, and as time passed the world's laws here rejected me more and more. I was worried—if you were gone for decades, what would I do? Now there is such an opportunity; of course I'll seize it. You can rest assured, Yang Kai; I'll temporarily hold the place on that mining star. If some short-sighted fool discovers it, I'll deal with them."

"With Elder Qian's word, then I truly am at ease." Yang Kai nodded, stood up, and waved his hand: "No time to waste—let's depart."

In front of Lingxiao Sect's Great Space Array, more than two thousand warriors waited in orderly fashion.

Of those two thousand, one thousand were from Yingyue Hall and the rest from Lingxiao Sect.

None of them were very high in cultivation, but all were at least of the Saint King Realm, with a few Origin Returning Realm practitioners mixed in; after all, they were going to an unknown star and needed some experts to ensure safety.

Fifty formed a team. The leader of each team held a Teleportation Token and, under Ye Xijun's supervision, entered the Great Space Array in turn. Qian Tong went with the first batch to scout ahead, in case any danger awaited.

White light flashed continuously. Once the Space Array started operating it hardly stopped.

In the time it took a single incense stick to burn, the two thousand people disappeared cleanly.

On the cold, desolate dead star, the group appeared in a valley. Looking around, almost everyone felt uneasy and alarmed.

For these two thousand people, it was their first experience of the vastness and terror of the Star Domain; a dead star without Spiritual Qi and without living creatures felt oppressive to them.

Seeing Yang Kai appear last, Qian Tong hurried over and asked, "Is this the mining star you mentioned?"

"Yes."

"It doesn't look very rich," Qian Tong said suspiciously.

Yang Kai laughed loudly: "A dead star is lifeless on the surface; you cannot tell its wealth from appearance. The real mystery is below!"

Saying that, Yang Kai stamped his foot.

"Underground?"

"Exactly. Follow me!" Yang Kai gestured and led the way.

The two thousand followed closely behind him, keeping guard as they advanced.

Only when they realized there really was no danger did they slowly relax.

It was indeed difficult for danger to appear in a place without Spiritual Qi.

It took Yang Kai an hour to lead the two thousand through the wasteland before he came to the pit, leapt up, and jumped down.

The two thousand descended in orderly fashion.

Soon everyone stood before the ruins.

As Yang Kai recounted his various conjectures about these ruins, Qian Tong and Ye Xijun could not help but sigh.

Life and death, the cycle of Dao—the heavens and earth could not escape such fate; might cultivators do any better? Perhaps after countless years they too would become a handful of dust. The powerful Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall might one day become ruins like these, trodden by no one for countless years.

Both of them looked somewhat saddened.

"My thought is this: this place is just right to build a camp. The ground is already cleared; with some work we can use it as a base. From here you can spread out to explore and mine; disciples who need rest can return here to recuperate. What do you two think?" Yang Kai pointed to the ruins.

"Very good! I see no problem with that." Qian Tong nodded.

"And Great Elder?" Yang Kai looked at Ye Xijun.

"Of course I have no objection."

"But the materials to build houses…" Qian Tong frowned.

Ye Xijun pursed her lips and smiled: "We brought them. Since the Sect Master had already thought of this, how could he not make preparations? Before coming he had disciples prepare everything."

“In that case, this old man shall bask in your good fortune.” Qian Tong laughed heartily, then turned around and shouted, “Disciples of Yingyue Hall, heed my command! Assist the brothers and sisters of Lingxiao Sect in constructing houses here — from now on, this place shall be your temporary home!”

The one thousand Yingyue Hall disciples roared in agreement.

In an instant the ruins that had been desolate for countless years became lively; two thousand people moved about, using the materials they had brought to erect buildings.

Yang Kai began arranging Space Arrays here!

Since this would be a camp, of course a Space Array was needed to link it to the outside; whether to the Great Space Array in the valley or the array Yang Kai had left in the vein, a transfer array was needed to connect them all.

In this way mining would be more convenient and the disciples would save much back-and-forth time.
