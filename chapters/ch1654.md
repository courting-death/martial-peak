## Chapter 1654 — Star Emperor Token Unsealed

"Is this mine?" Su Yan looked up at the enormous Ice Phoenix apparition; as if sensing her gaze, the normally mindless Ice Phoenix lowered its head and, with those noble eyes, glanced at Su Yan once, its look filled with warmth and approval.

Everyone was stunned.

With the Ice Phoenix's primal power fused to her, Su Yan felt an immediate lightness throughout her body; the recent backlash from the Ice Jade Skill was dispelled in an instant, leaving her body and mind thoroughly comfortable.

The pristine white apparition hovering above her head was like blood flowing out from her body — a part of her.

Her skin grew even paler and more translucent, her slender neck shimmering with a porcelain-like delicacy; in that moment Su Yan's allure leapt several notches, capable of overturning all beings.

Even experts like Chi Huo and Luo Hai were momentarily dazed by Su Yan's dazzling radiance.

"Yes — I brought it from the Tongxuan Continent," Yang Kai nodded.

The Senior Sister and her Junior Brother conversed as if no one else existed; no one present showed concern for the current situation.

"Hmm… I feel something," Su Yan breathed softly, closing her beautiful eyes as her mind resonated oddly with the Ice Phoenix apparition. The Ice Phoenix chirped with delight; each cry contained boundless might, stirring the icy breath of Icebound Island, which poured in like ten thousand streams into the sea and converged into Su Yan's body, absorbed by her without restraint.

Su Yan's own aura strengthened at a terrifying, visible speed.

She had originally been at the peak of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; if Yang Kai had not appeared, she would have been preparing to break through to the Second Stage in the near future.

But because of the backlash from the Ice Jade Skill, her cultivation had fallen instead of rising.

Now, her cultivation rose again.

Peak of the First Stage — the Second Stage — peak of the Second Stage…

Her momentum surged like a bamboo cleaving; in an extremely short time she advanced to the peak of the Second Stage, only seeming to stall because of some interference.

That interference came from Yang Kai!

The two at this moment formed a strange twin-body, single-heart state. Yang Kai's cultivation only reached the peak of the Second Stage, so Su Yan could not advance further; otherwise the balance between their Saint Yuan would be broken.

But anyone could see she still had reserves! She had the ability to elevate her strength to the Third Stage!

Everyone was shaken. Never before had anyone broken through so rapidly and without danger — this was not merely a fortunate opportunity, it was a miracle.

Yang Kai smiled gently, as if all of this had been foreseen.

A dragon's roar and a phoenix's cry rang out again. The phantoms of the golden dragon and the white Ice Phoenix twisted; they pounced from the high sky, poured into Yang Kai and Su Yan, and vanished within them.

Around the Senior Sister and her junior, a strange aura quietly formed.

The aura was visible to the naked eye: half golden, half snow-white — clearly two utterly different attribute energies, yet perfectly fused together, forming Shi that far exceeded the Origin Returning Realm!

Any Origin Returning Realm expert faced with such Shi would find no will to resist.

"Is this your trump card?" Luo Hai's gaze turned terrifying, flashing brilliant light as he fixed his eyes on Yang Kai and stepped down from his place of prominence.

With each step he took, Icebound Island seemed to tremble — a shaking from the depths of the earth that struck the soul.

With every step his own Shi increased.

The golden-and-white yin-yang aura of Yang Kai and Su Yan could not suppress Luo Hai.

Yang Kai remained expressionless, smiling as he watched the enemy draw nearer.

"If that is your trump card, then I advise you to give up. Your strength is indeed remarkable — enough to be invincible below the Void King Realm; even an ordinary Void King Realm might find you troublesome," he said.

At those words, Chi Huo and Luo Li both frowned.

Whether they wished to admit it or not, Luo Hai spoke the truth: anyone facing Yang Kai and Su Yan here would feel extremely troubled; even if one could ultimately win, the cost would be enormous.

It was an astonishing matter.

The Void King Realm already stood at the pinnacle of this world; any Void King Realm could sweep aside all Origin Returning Realm cultivators — even if hundreds or thousands came, they could not touch a Void King Realm's hem.

That Yang Kai and his Senior Sister, by the strength of just the two of them, could trade blows with an ordinary Void King Realm expert was the limit of human imagination.

Among those present, perhaps only Luo Hai could afford to disregard Yang Kai and Su Yan.

"Boy, come with me obediently and I guarantee I won't kill you!" Luo Hai glared at Yang Kai with a dark expression, no longer bothered to keep his benevolent teacher's guise.

“You won’t shed tears until you see the coffin. Luo Hai, I bore you no grudge, yet you’ve relentlessly driven me—fine. Today I’ll kill you and put an end to future trouble,” Yang Kai bellowed.

“Kill me?” Luo Hai burst into loud laughter, as though he had just heard the funniest joke in the world. “It seems your confidence has swelled a bit too much. Do you really think you can kill me in your current state? Allow this King to show you what true Void King Realm really is!”

As his words fell, a strange force rippled outward, wrapping toward Yang Kai and Su Yan.

A Domain field!

A Star Lord-level Domain field.

The earth suddenly cracked and groaned; the place where the Ice Palace had stood split with fissures — the Domain field's might threatened to make heaven and earth collapse.

"Brother Luo Hai, I'll aid you!" Chi Huo shouted, releasing his own Domain field to pressure Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Luo Hai glanced at him but said nothing.

He knew well what Chi Huo was scheming.

It was nothing more than the desire not to let benefits be monopolized, so he stepped in to share a slice of the spoils.

Luo Hai was delighted — what he desired was Yang Kai's secret. As for that girl called Su Yan… although the Ice Phoenix's primal power was extraordinary, it did not suit his cultivation path and would be useless to him.

When the two Void King Realm Domain fields came forth, many elders of Ice Heart Valley changed color.

Luo Li hurriedly unleashed her own Domain field to offset the pressure on everyone and shouted, "Leave!"

If they did not leave, many of the elders would be harmed.

Bing Long, Ran Yunting and the others said nothing, swiftly using movement techniques to depart, leaping a thousand zhang into the sky and gazing down with faces of utter shock. Only Luo Li remained on the ground with a complicated expression but no intent to intervene; a soft sigh slipped from her lips as she looked at Yang Kai and Su Yan with eyes full of regret.

"Senior Sister, are you ready?" With the two Void King Realm Domain fields pressing down, Yang Kai remained calm.

Having endured trials in the Blood Prison, he had grown accustomed to this strength of Domain field interference; such a field could not crush him — if he did not fall, Su Yan would be fine.

"Ready!" Su Yan nodded.

They shared a tacit understanding; there was no need for Yang Kai to explain. With a single thought Su Yan understood what he would do.

“Ready? Then let’s begin!” Yang Kai grinned, turned his head, and fixed Luo Hai with an icy stare as he shouted sternly, “Luo Hai, today is the day you die!”

As he spoke, a strange token suddenly appeared in his palm.

The token was jet black all over, made of unknown material and looked utterly unremarkable.

But the instant the token appeared, Luo Hai's brow twitched and a cold dread rose in his heart.

"This is…" Luo Hai looked at the token in bewilderment, then realized, "Imperial Might! A Star Emperor Token?"

A faint, almost imperceptible aura emanated from the token, and it was this aura that changed Luo Hai's expression.

And the clearly discernible character meaning 'Emperor' on the token finally made Luo Hai understand what Yang Kai's ultimate trump card truly was.

It was actually a Star Emperor Token! And one that had not yet been unsealed!

It was said that the Starry Sky Emperor stood unmatched through all ages, leaving behind countless unshakable legends throughout the Star Domain—after which, all traces of his divine presence vanished.

However, the Star Emperor Tokens he personally crafted were passed down through the ages. There were a total of nine Star Emperor Tokens, each one sealed with one of the Emperor’s divine abilities—powers great enough to instantly slay even those of the Void King Realm, belonging to a level utterly beyond the reach of the Star Domain’s experts.

To ordinary martial artists the Star Emperor Token was merely a legend, its existence even in doubt.

Yet a powerhouse of Luo Hai's caliber knew they existed — the renowned Hengluo Commerce Guild in the Star Domain possessed one, though it had been unsealed and the emperor's divine technique lost, leaving only traces of Imperial Might.

If a Void King Realm expert were to carry a Star Emperor Token with them and, over the years, comprehend the Imperial Might sealed within it, it could aid their cultivation and increase their chances of grasping the Heavenly and Martial Dao.

Thus he recognized the token in Yang Kai's hand at a glance and immediately felt uneasy.

"Bad!" Luo Hai cried in alarm. "Brother Chi Huo, hurry and kill them — you absolutely cannot let them unseal the Star Emperor Token."

Chi Huo trembled; a flash of resolve and ruthless intent crossed his eyes. He bit his tongue and spat a spray of Essence-Blood like burning flame, which flared into roaring fire that wrapped Yang Kai and Su Yan.

He was ruthless as well, knowing that hesitation would cause disaster. He spent his Essence-Blood in one strike, seeking to kill Yang Kai and Su Yan as quickly as possible; otherwise, once the Star Emperor Token was unsealed, he certainly would not be a match.

The emperor's legend was terrifying — an unassailable myth.

As Chi Huo struck, Luo Hai moved as well, summoning a secret treasure like a long sword. Its surface shone like moonlight, exuding the aura of a Void King‑grade Secret Treasure. Luo Hai poured Saint Yuan into it; the sword hummed and trembled, then, with a slight quiver in the void, it suddenly vanished.

When it reappeared it had already reached Yang Kai's side, stabbing straight toward his heart.

Yang Kai merely stood where he was, smiling coldly as if the mortal threat were nothing, and poured his Saint Yuan frantically into the Star Emperor Token in his hand.

Heaven and earth shuddered as if the end of the world were at hand; a desolate, terrifying aura descended.
