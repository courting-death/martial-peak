## Chapter 310 — Thank You

Not long after, the spider suddenly went berserk, attacking its companions without warning. The other spiders, seeing this, hurriedly scurried with their eight legs towards the battlefield.

Shan Qingluo waved her delicate hand, directly cutting a gap in the spider web, and her figure vanished in a flash. Her voice reached Yang Kai's ear: “Don't move, wait for me to return!”

Yang Kai naturally would not move recklessly. His expression remained calm as he carefully observed the commotion outside.

The spider he controlled was currently engaged in a fierce battle with its companions. As a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast, it had developed a degree of intelligence. Although not much, it could at least perform some simple reasoning.

The attacked spiders seemed to not understand why this companion had suddenly gone mad, just as they did not comprehend why it had previously killed many martial artists from the Cangyun Evil Land.

After a moment of resistance, the spiders seemed to communicate in some manner and suddenly stopped holding back, as if they had determined that this companion had lost its sanity and could not be saved.

In a short time, the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast controlled by Yang Kai was killed.

The spiders that had gathered together then scattered like birds and beasts.

“Yang Kai!” Qiu Yimeng suddenly called out.

Yang Kai coldly ignored her.

“Has Sister Shan already regained her strength?” Qiu Yimeng asked anxiously.

Still, there was no response.

Qiu Yimeng forced a smile and said, “Yang Kai, you’re not such a petty man, are you? I admit I have offended you before, can’t I just apologize?”

“No need, Miss Qiu's status is noble, I cannot afford it,” Yang Kai replied dismissively.

Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly, “Alright, alright, I was wrong. I truly was wrong for bringing people to your Lingxiao Pavilion to cause trouble. In fact, I haven’t done anything to you. You are so strong, who knows who would win if we really fought? Before this, I truly couldn’t believe that a small sect could cultivate a disciple like you.”

“Stop with the flattery, it sounds quite nauseating.”

“Hehe, we both understand each other. Then I won’t beat around the bush and annoy you,” Qiu Yimeng said with a light laugh. “When Sister Shan returns, could you please ask her to take me and Xiaoman with her? Don’t worry, as long as she agrees, my Qiu Family will definitely reward you generously!”

“Whether she saves you or not is her business; I cannot interfere,” Yang Kai frowned.

“Really? I see that you two have such a good relationship. The Enchantress Queen has never been this close to any man. If you could help us speak a good word, Sister Shan would definitely not stand by and watch us die.” As she spoke, Qiu Yimeng's voice softened, “As long as you don’t make me and Xiaoman serve as maids, I’ll agree to any other conditions! Even if you want to marry a young woman from my Qiu Family’s collateral line, I can make that happen! Hehe… but in front of Sister Shan, I think it’s better if you don’t mention this, lest she gets jealous.”

Yang Kai showed a look of impatience: “I’ve said it. Whether she saves you or not is her business. I’m struggling to protect myself; is there any meaning in you talking so much nonsense?”

Qiu Yimeng smiled bitterly, her expression turning sorrowful: “But I can only place my hopes on you. If you don’t lend a hand, Xiaoman and I will probably find it hard to escape this calamity.” As she spoke, her voice choked with emotion, looking pitiful: “Can you really bear to watch us die?”

Knowing she was just putting on an act to gain his sympathy, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel disgusted. He no longer wished to pay her any attention.

He had never had a good impression of women who played with schemes.

“Yang Kai, Yang Kai…” Qiu Yimeng, undeterred, continued to softly call out.

Though their conversation was quiet, Luo Xiaoman was not far away and could hear everything clearly.

Seeing Yang Kai’s cold and unfeeling demeanor, Luo Xiaoman’s expression also turned bleak. In a state of confusion, she softly called out: “Sister Qiu, what should we do?”

Qiu Yimeng sighed softly, giving up on trying to sway Yang Kai, and said with a bitter smile: “Let’s wait. We can’t really die here.”

At that moment, a fragrant breeze suddenly swept over, and a striking red figure appeared before Yang Kai. With a flick of her finger, the spider web binding Yang Kai was cut open.

“Go!” Shan Qingluo’s expression was tense as she pulled Yang Kai with one hand and leaped upward.

Yang Kai followed closely, his expression grave. Through his Divine Sense, he sensed the unique vigorous vitality of the Spider Mother rapidly awakening, clearly indicating that Shan Qingluo’s earlier actions had startled it.

“Sister Shan.” Qiu Yimeng hurriedly called out, her teeth clenched, revealing a hint of hesitation and struggle on her face.

But she also knew that this moment was critical; if Shan Qingluo managed to escape, she and Luo Xiaoman would truly have no chance of escaping.

“Sister Shan, I agree to your previous conditions. Please take me and Xiaoman with you!” Qiu Yimeng shouted in a deep voice.

Shan Qingluo frowned as she looked at her. With a wave of her hand, two pink ribbons shot through the air, directly wrapping around Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, shooting up into the sky like lightning.

Seeing that Shan Qingluo hadn’t abandoned them, both Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman felt a surge of joy at their miraculous escape from danger.

“You have betrayed your own bloodline and dare not heed my advice. Where do you think you’re going?” The Spider Mother’s furious voice rang out, devoid of any charm, sounding like an enraged madwoman.

As she spoke, two strands of pure white and tough spider silk shot towards them.

These two strands of spider silk were incredibly fast, almost instantaneously reaching them. Shan Qingluo and Yang Kai changed their expressions and simultaneously struck out to block.

In the clash of Yuan Qi, the two strands of spider silk were barely stopped, but the residual force severed one of the ribbons in Shan Qingluo’s hand, the other end of which was binding Luo Xiaoman.

A cry of alarm escaped, and terror blossomed in Luo Xiaoman’s beautiful eyes, her heart filled with dread.

Yang Kai reacted swiftly, wrapping a leg around Qiu Yimeng’s waist, sending a gentle force out, causing her to fly towards Luo Xiaoman.

Before she could fall, Qiu Yimeng quickly reached out to grab Luo Xiaoman’s clothing, lifting her up.

“Sister Qiu…” Luo Xiaoman cried out in a trembling voice, tears rolling down her cheeks, her chest rising and falling in waves, her delicate face filled with fear.

“I’ve got you, don’t worry, I won’t let go,” Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly at her, her expression also filled with lingering fear.

Shan Qingluo cast a meaningful glance at Yang Kai, a breathtaking smile playing on her lips.

Yang Kai shrugged.

That kick just now was purely instinctive, without any consideration!

Suddenly, a shout from Bai Yunfeng rang out from below: “Take me with you! You bunch of shameless people… how can you leave me here alone? I won’t let you off even if I become a ghost!”

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman’s faces turned to disgust, their expressions growing cold.

Time reveals a horse's strength, and over time, one sees a person's heart. Bai Yunfeng had previously given the two women a decent impression; although not particularly outstanding, he was at least a young master from a prominent family, wealthy and powerful, with decent strength, and many young women pursued him.

But this time of misfortune had completely exposed the dark side hidden within him.

He truly was a man worse than dog shit! Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman felt no sympathy for him at all.

……

A not too large lake shimmered under the sunlight, the water crystal clear, revealing the aquatic plants and fish swimming joyfully within.

A bonfire blazed as Yang Kai roasted a few plump fish from the lake.

Luo Xiaoman and Qiu Yimeng sat beside him, looking disheveled, breathing in the fresh air, their expressions complex as they gazed at him.

A sound came from the water, and Shan Qingluo emerged gracefully from the lake, her body glistening like the finest silk, her snow-white skin faintly glowing with a strange red hue, walking slowly with her jade feet bare.

With a myriad of postures, her tender red lips slightly pursed, a significant portion of her allure exposed to the air, only her chest and the area between her legs were covered by scanty clothing, revealing just enough to hint at her beauty.

Such a captivating sight, enchanting and bewitching, made Yang Kai’s heart race, and even Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman felt their cheeks flush, their breathing slightly hurried.

The three quickly averted their gazes, simultaneously cursing the mesmerizing enchantress who was deadly charming!

Shan Qingluo caught their gazes and laughed sweetly.

Arriving at the lakeside, her clothes draped over her, half-covered, she walked gracefully towards Yang Kai and sat down beside him.

“Can you be a bit more restrained?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Do I need to be restrained in front of you?” Shan Qingluo laughed, “We’ve touched and kissed, why bother with so many formalities?”

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman looked at Yang Kai in shock, their expressions gradually turning strange.

Although Qiu Yimeng had previously sensed that Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo’s relationship was not simple, she had not seen it with her own eyes and did not know how close they truly were.

Sitting next to him in disheveled clothing, which woman would act so shamelessly if not infatuated?

The most enchanting woman in the world was now taken? Qiu Yimeng felt a bit dazed, and looking at Yang Kai again, although he was not bad-looking and had decent strength, he was still just a youth, only at the Fourth Stage of True Essence.

What qualifications did he have to capture the heart of the Enchantress Queen?

Qiu Yimeng was astonished, unable to regain her senses for a long time.

Yang Kai rolled his eyes, ignoring the alluring sight beside him, focusing on roasting the fish.

The aroma of the meat wafted through the air, causing Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman’s stomachs to rumble, their faces turning red.

The two had been chased by martial artists from the Cangyun Evil Land for over a month, hardly getting any rest, feeling both exhausted and hungry. After being captured by the spiders, they could finally relax now that they had escaped.

“Thank you, Sister Shan, for saving us this time,” Qiu Yimeng said, forcing a smile to express her gratitude.

Shan Qingluo chuckled, pursing her lips: “There’s just a transaction between us, no need to thank me!”

“Though that may be true, without Sister Shan, Xiaoman and I would surely have met with disaster,” Qiu Yimeng gently shook her head.

After speaking, she cast a complex glance at Yang Kai, reluctantly saying: “And thank you too!”

If it weren’t for his timely kick at the last moment, Qiu Yimeng would not have been able to reach Luo Xiaoman in time.

Yang Kai remained cold-faced, offering no response.

Qiu Yimeng’s frustration grew.
