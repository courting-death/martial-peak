## Chapter 1533 — Bibo Plain

Star Emperor Mountain, Lingjue Peak — white clouds drifted across the mid-slope, and at that tranquil summit an unusual fluctuation of energy suddenly rose; Heaven-and-Earth Energy frantically converged on a single point, gradually forming a vortex there.

At first the vortex was tiny, but as Heaven-and-Earth Energy poured in it grew larger and larger until it spanned several zhang across.

Leisurely, a figure stepped out of the vortex as if crossing through the void, standing proudly in midair.

Turning to look around, Yang Kai found no trace of anyone; only a lone altar stood not far off, weathered by wind and sun.

Yang Kai's expression was calm; this scene did not surprise him in the slightest.

He did not know exactly how long he had stayed inside that Small Xuan Realm, but it was certainly not ten days or half a month — at the very least, several years had passed.

After so long, Ye Xijun and the others could not have waited here for him; they had most likely already returned to the Lingxiao Sect.

He tried to sense the Dragon Bone sword and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, but there was no trace of them — they had probably been taken back by Ye Xijun.

Qi Tianche and Fang Peng were dead; on Dark Star, the three colossal beings that once towered above every force had all fallen, leaving none able to stop the Lingxiao Sect's advance. With Ye Xijun stationed at the sect, Yang Kai felt much more at ease and thus had little to worry about.

He released his Divine Sense; Star Emperor Mountain was utterly silent, without a hint of life.

It seemed the martial artists on Star Emperor Mountain had all withdrawn. Whether they followed Yang Xiuzhu and the others back to the Lingxiao Sect or dispersed on their own was unclear.

The former seemed more likely.

With no one left here, Yang Kai naturally did not wish to linger.

He turned, pointed at the vortex with a hand, and the vortex abruptly contracted and vanished in the blink of an eye. In its place appeared an unremarkable-looking bead.

One of the two Imperial Treasures, the Xuan Realm Pearl!

This was an extraordinary treasure; within it existed a self-contained realm. With it, a long-standing problem that had haunted Yang Kai could be solved.

Moreover, Yang Kai felt that if he could truly refine the Xuan Realm Pearl and make its Heavenly-and-Earth laws whole, it might even allow a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator to breakthrough inside and ascend to the Void King Realm!

The reason Dark Star's cultivators could not rise to the Void King Realm was the suppression of the Heavenly-and-Earth laws.

But because the Xuan Realm Pearl contained its own realm with its own laws, it was not bound by Dark Star's constraints.

This was absolutely a viable method, but it was still too soon to consider it. Although Yang Kai's research into spatial power had expanded the Small Xuan Realm to a radius of a hundred li, he was still far from completely unsealing and refining it.

After observing and pondering for a while, Yang Kai stored the Xuan Realm Pearl within his body and casually took a step forward.

One moment he stood atop Lingjue Peak; the next he was already at the mid-slope.

One more step, and Yang Kai had arrived at the foot of the mountain...

The speed was unimaginable.

The mysteries of Spatial Force were boundless. The time he had spent cultivating within the Xuan Realm Pearl had greatly advanced his mastery of this power. This rapid movement of his form resembled the legendary instant-transmission; it left no trace and had truly broken the bonds of space.

It was far more profound than the spatial tearing Yang Kai first learned.

Tearing space was a process—one easily disrupted by the force released from powerful experts. Yet now, Yang Kai’s movements were as effortless and elusive as a hanging antelope’s horns, no longer bound by the restraints he once faced.

If there was a shortcoming, there was one.

It did not cover as much distance as tearing space could.

With Yang Kai's current strength, a single spatial tear could carry him two to three thousand li, whereas this method could only move him a dozen or so li at a time.

Each had its advantages and disadvantages; neither was absolutely better. Both, however, consumed Saint Yuan heavily.

Yang Kai kept moving, getting familiar with his control of Spatial Force. After traveling over a hundred thousand li, he finally summoned the Star Shuttle to continue his journey.

Continuously traveling using Spatial Force was taxing, so using the Star Shuttle for long distances was wiser.

......

On a vast boundless plain came the roaring and shouts of beasts that rose straight to the clouds. A group of four or five cultivators, old and young, male and female, were together besieging a huge, ferocious demonic beast.

The beast had a tiger's head, elephantine feet, and a leopard's tail, appearing majestic and arrogant.

Its tiger head shone a reddish-copper color, seeming extremely solid, and there were odd patterns on its body that looked rather mysterious.

A Cracked Copper-Headed Tiger, an Eighth-Tier demonic beast, with tough skin and thick flesh — exceptionally resilient.

Leading those attempting to surround and hunt it was an elder only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm; the rest were merely in the Saint Realm. From their mutual calls and warnings one could tell they were cultivators of some small family, hunting on the plain for Saint Crystals.

An Eighth-Tier demonic beast roughly equated to a Saint King Realm cultivator.

But this Cracked Copper-Headed Tiger was at the peak of the Eighth Tier, so though besieged it remained ferocious. It roared and continuously spat out spheres of extreme power from its maw, preventing the small family cultivators from approaching.

The elder, however, was experienced and commanded well, so despite the intense struggle, none of his disciples had suffered mortal wounds.

With sufficient time, this group might still have a chance to slay the Cracked Copper-Headed Tiger.

Suddenly, an energy fluctuation hurried over from afar. From the crowd a girl in green looked up and cried out, "Second Uncle, someone's coming."

Hearing the shout, the elder looked up, his eyelids narrowing.

He was older and could tell at a glance that the newcomer's strength was not low; otherwise there would be no such speed. While he pondered whether the arrival was friend or foe, a momentary lapse allowed the Cracked Copper-Headed Tiger to break free from his grasp.

The tiger's roar shook the heavens. Having been besieged for long, its ferocity had risen; after breaking free it did not flee but lunged directly at the girl in green, opening its blood-red maw to bite at her pale neck.

The girl turned pale with fear. For a moment she was thrown into chaos, hastily producing a Secret Treasure, but it could not stop the beast's attack.

As the beast's fangs drew ever nearer, a flash of horror crossed the girl's eyes.

Shouts erupted around. The girl saw her Second Uncle desperately rushing over, attempting to snatch her from the tiger's jaws.

But it was evidently already too late.

She saw death beckoning to her.

At that instant a breeze seemed to brush past; the world blurred, and a figure interposed itself before her.

That figure loomed like a mountain of ten thousand zhang, blocking the coming storm and bringing her an inexplicable sense of safety.

Dong!

A tremendous sound rang out. Mixed with the beast's whimpering, the girl clearly saw that the person before her had only thrown a single punch. The Cracked Copper-Headed Tiger, which they had not managed to kill after besieging it for so long, flew like a sandbag.

Its skull seemed deformed from the blow.

It hit the ground and after a few convulsions lay motionless.

The wind passed and the plain fell silent; four or five pairs of eyes fixed on Yang Kai, unable to return to themselves, faces full of disbelief.

Although an Eighth-Tier demonic beast, the tiger's skull was famed for its hardness; even an Origin Returning Realm expert could not normally deform it with a single punch.

Looking at that solid back, for some reason the green-clad girl's heart leapt and her nostrils trembled.

She smelled a scent from him that made her extremely comfortable.

Secretly appraising him, the girl discovered he seemed not very old — merely a youth — and this realization made her inexplicably elated.

"Sorry, looks like I ruined your prize," Yang Kai said, rubbing his nose with some embarrassment.

He also recognized the beast: a Cracked Copper-Headed Tiger. Its two most valuable parts were its Inner Core, coveted by alchemists, and its head, sought after by artificers.

By deforming the beast's skull with a single punch, its value had surely diminished.

Hearing him speak, the elder suddenly came to his senses, his expression grave. He cupped his hands and said, "This old man pays respects to Young Brother. Young Brother's timely intervention saved Fei'er; if not for you, she would have died. This old man is deeply grateful and dares not lay blame."

"You're too polite, elder. It seems my sudden arrival disturbed your intent," Yang Kai chuckled. "If anyone is to blame, it's me."

Seeing his affability, the elder relaxed; after all this was a remote wilderness, and if the newcomer harbored ill intent there would be no way to resist.

Fortunately the newcomer had no such thoughts and was rather magnanimous.

The elder grew very fond of Yang Kai.

"I came to ask what place this is," Yang Kai said, looking at the elder.

"This is Bibo Plain," the elder replied.

"Bibo Plain!" Yang Kai frowned; he had not heard this name and did not know where on Dark Star he now stood.

After leaving Star Emperor Mountain, Yang Kai had been practicing control of Spatial Force, running back and forth until he had lost his way...

"Which city is nearest?" Yang Kai asked.

"To the west, fifty thousand li from here, there is Bibo City; that is the nearest city."

"Is there a Space Array?"

"As far as this old man knows, there is one, but that Space Array seems not open to outsiders and is for internal use only. If Young Brother wishes to use a Space Array, you can depart from Bibo City and head two hundred thousand li to Battle Sky City; there a Space Array is open to outsiders."

"Oh? Battle Sky City?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, surprised.

He had not expected to be so near Battle Sky City.

"Indeed. Strictly speaking, Bibo City could be considered an affiliate of Battle Sky City; the two are connected to some extent." As a cultivator of this small family's clan, the elder naturally knew these details well.
