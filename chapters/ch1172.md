## Chapter 1172 — Touched by the Scene

Yin Jianzhong is, after all, the most talented disciple of Qingque Sect; although his fame doesn't shine as brightly as someone like Wei Guchang, his ability certainly entitles him to call out 'Brother Guchang.' In the past he dealt with geniuses from other sects the same way, and no one ever made a fuss.

But Wei Guchang gave him no face this time; a round of cutting remarks left Yin Jianzhong embarrassed, and he bit back his words and amended his tone: "Brother Wei…"

“Was it you just now who said Brother Yang would suffer a loss he couldn’t swallow?” Wei Guchang asked coldly, fixing Yin Jianzhong with a frosty glare as he began to demand an explanation.

Qian Tong had him bring Yang Kai forward so they might strike up an acquaintance; he hadn't expected that the moment he left Yang Kai would be harassed. That angered Wei Guchang greatly—of course he wouldn't let this pass. If he couldn't even take care of this bit of face, then he had no right to befriend Yang Kai.

"What happened just now was truly a misunderstanding. Had I known this friend was from Yingyue Hall…"

"I already said I'm not from Yingyue Hall," Yang Kai cut him off again.

Yin Jianzhong's face flushed; he didn't know what to say. He had shown such weakness in front of thirty fellow disciples that it was already shameful. Seeing Wei Guchang so immovable and unwilling to forgive, he realized that unless he took a definite stand, there would be no settling this.

All he could do was look miserable and say, "This matter is my fault. I, Yin, had poor eyes—Brother Wei and this friend, please do not hold it against us!"

Saying that, he bowed slightly and prepared to lead his disciples away, removing themselves from this place of trouble.

"Coming when you please, leaving when you please—it's not that easy," Wei Guchang snorted. He despised those who bullied the weak yet cringed before the strong. Had Yin Jianzhong dared face him directly, he might have earned Wei's respect; but those who preyed on the weak at first sight made him scornful.

By comparison, he admired that Yang Kai remained unperturbed beneath the thirty-man encirclement.

Yin Jianzhong had to halt; his fists clenched, a vein throbbing on his forehead, he ground his teeth and growled, "Brother Wei, what more do you want? My Junior Brother's arm was twisted by this friend, and I myself was punched. Your friend is unscathed—did he suffer any loss?"

"Whether he suffered is not for me to say. By the time I arrived you had already surrounded him. Even if Brother Yang shows no outward injury, he may well have been shaken."

Yang Kai's face was indifferent. He nodded in agreement when prompted.

The dozens of Qingque Sect disciples couldn't help but gape.

Frightened? He looked like someone who feared nothing in heaven or earth; even with a blade at his throat he would not bat an eyelid. How could he be frightened? It was plainly nonsense.

Even though they knew Wei Guchang and Yang Kai were talking rubbish, no one dared to question them. He was deliberately making trouble—who would be foolish enough to pour oil on the fire?

"Brother Yang was clearly frightened," Wei Guchang said with solemnity, casting a look at Yang Kai as if in pity.

"Brother Wei, draw a line here. I will take responsibility," Yin Jianzhong sighed helplessly; the whites of his left eye were bloodshot, whether from anger or from the punch Yang Kai had just landed, he couldn't tell.

"One million Saint Crystals!" Wei Guchang spoke bluntly and gave a number.

"Brother Wei, don't be so unreasonable!" Yin Jianzhong's face turned red with anger as he snapped, "One million—how am I supposed to come up with that?"

Qingque Sect was respectable, but a single disciple like him couldn't possibly carry so many Saint Crystals on his person.

"You don't even have a paltry one million Saint Crystals. You think you can bargain with Brother Yang for a passage token? Have you lost your wits from eating too much lard?"

Yang Kai looked at Wei Guchang in surprise; he suddenly realized that though this man appeared calm and proper, he harbored dark designs—his words were slimily malicious. Truly, one cannot judge a person by appearance.

He couldn't imagine what Wei Guchang was like when alone with Xuan'er; that tranquil girl would surely be eaten alive by him.

Yin Jianzhong snorted hotly, seething as if he could no longer bear it. He seemed determined to have a proper fight with Wei Guchang—better to die than stand here and be wantonly humiliated.

Some Qingque Sect disciples cast pleading looks toward a not-distant elder who had brought them here—a two-Stage Origin Returning Realm elder—whose face had gone sour. Though he noticed his disciples' beseeching glances, he had no intention of stepping forward to intervene.

Not to mention the fault lay with Qingque Sect in the first place; besides, this clash involved young men—if an old man like him rushed over he would ruin the rules. Qingque Sect has Origin Returning Realm cultivators here; Yingyue Hall does not.

If he truly dared to step forward, it would only make the situation worse.

So even though he was furious inside, he could only stand there and watch from afar, unable to interfere rashly.

"Then how many Saint Crystals do you have?" Wei Guchang changed his tack.

Yin Jianzhong glanced at his fellows and asked around, then hung his head and said, "Five hundred thousand!"

Wei Guchang cast his gaze to Yang Kai. Yang Kai shrugged indifferently and said, "Five hundred thousand it is—just enough to mend the wound to my pride."

He certainly didn't care about a mere five hundred thousand Saint Crystals; but since these Qingque Sect people dared to pick a fight, they must pay. That he hadn't killed anyone was already the best outcome. As for saving their faces, Wei Guchang had no concern, and Yang Kai cared even less.

When Yin Jianzhong and his Junior Brother came to strong-arm him for a passage token, did they ever consider his face or consent? If it had been other, less-capable warriors from a minor family, they would undoubtedly have been taken advantage of by Yin Jianzhong.

“Then make it five hundred thousand—hurry up!” Wei Guchang barked impatiently, snorting in irritation. “It’s only because Brother Yang is generous that you’re getting off this cheap. If it were me you’d offended, I wouldn’t let you go for a mere five hundred thousand—unless I stripped you down to your pants, I wouldn’t be called Wei Guchang!”

No sooner had he finished speaking than his expression shifted slightly.

Xuan'er, with one small hand he somehow hadn't noticed, had been pinching the soft flesh at his waist. Her face flushed as she said, "Can you not speak like that? They have many female disciples among them."

Not only did Xuan'er blush, a dozen or so female Qingque Sect disciples turned pink as well, all shooting Wei Guchang reproachful glances.

Thirty people from Qingque Sect had only just scraped together five hundred thousand Saint Crystals. After all, they were heading into Flowing Flame Sandland where danger was rife; naturally they wouldn't carry too many Saint Crystals, for those were meant to be used there to recover.

Once the five hundred thousand Saint Crystals were handed to Yang Kai, Yin Jianzhong and the others slunk away.

"Gutless vermin!" Wei Guchang watched their backs and shook his head in contempt.

"Enough, let it pass—don't bother with them any longer," Xuan'er said softly, then timely changed the subject: "Didn't you specially bring out Qiong Jade Liquor to entertain Senior Brother Yang? Since it's still early, why not take it out now?"

"Right, right—if Sister hadn't mentioned it I might've forgotten," Wei Guchang chuckled, patting his head. The ring on his hand flashed with light as he produced antique-style tables and stools, setting them before them and warmly inviting Yang Kai to sit. He continued, "I just asked Uncle Wang and Uncle Yan; they say Flowing Flame Sandland should not open for another three days, and Elder Qian and the others haven't arrived. We might as well drink while we wait."

"Fine," Yang Kai smiled and inclined his head; one does not refuse such hospitality.

The so-called Qiong Jade Liquor was taken out by Wei Guchang — two delicate little jars. As the seal mud was broken, a rich fragrance of wine spread instantly, wafting about with a life of its own and flowing straight into Yang Kai’s nostrils.

Xuan'er then produced two plates of spirit-fruit from her Spatial Ring; the fruits were translucent and clearly no ordinary fare.

Yang Kai knew little of wines; Wei Guchang handed him a cup and he drank. Only after finishing did he realize it was a spirit-wine, much like the Thousand Red Flower Wine brewed by Master Fei Yu of Tianxiao Sect on Tongxuan Continent—capable of strengthening the body and aiding cultivation.

But this Qiong Jade Liquor was a far higher grade than Fei Yu's Thousand Red Flower Wine; after all, this was the Star Domain, and the materials available here were rarer and superior.

A single swallow and Yang Kai immediately felt his Saint Yuan circulate a little faster. The liquid was like a spirit essence, seeping into his frame and lying dormant in his flesh and blood, as if waiting to erupt when needed.

Wei Guchang guzzled a long draught with relish, then explained, "This Qiong Jade Liquor of mine comes from a recipe I obtained long ago on an adventure. In the whole Dark Star, besides me, there is no one else who can brew it. Don't underestimate it—though its immediate power isn't overwhelming, it has a long-term restorative effect. Drink a jar now and for at least the next half month it will help Brother Yang recover his Saint Yuan."

Hearing him, Yang Kai immediately understood his earlier guess was correct—the elixir truly lay dormant until needed—and he hurriedly said, "I'm no connoisseur of wine. To be given such a fine thing to drink feels like plundering the heavens."

Wei Guchang laughed heartily. "Whatever is hoarded and not shared can't be called truly good. Xuan'er doesn't drink much; in Yingyue Hall I have few kindred spirits. Meeting Brother Yang and being able to drink and laugh together is a blessing of three lifetimes. Don't say such things—that's to deny me face."

Whether he meant it sincerely or merely followed Qian Tong's instruction mattered little. In any case, Wei Guchang now appeared to be getting along quite well with Yang Kai.

“Then I won’t stand on ceremony.” Yang Kai laughed heartily, lifted the jar, and took a great gulp just like Wei Guchang — prompting Wei Guchang to cheer in approval.

Xuan'er sat quietly by, a contented smile on her face; watching Wei Guchang and Yang Kai drink in turns made her, already fair, seem even more picturesque.

Whether it was the wine's effect or the sight that stirred him, Yang Kai thought inwardly that if Su Yan or Xia Ningshang were here now, they'd certainly sit quietly at his side like Xuan'er.

For these women, as long as they could be beside the man they loved, even the sky collapsing would not make them frown.
