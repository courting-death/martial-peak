## Chapter 217 — Arrival

The journey of merely five hundred li, under normal circumstances, would take this group of individuals only two hours to reach their destination with their speed. A master of the Divine Roaming Realm could even cover the distance in less than half an hour.

However, traversing five hundred li within the Ghostly Underworld Mountain took them a full two days, and they still had not arrived. The dangers and attacks they encountered along the way far exceeded everyone’s expectations.

“Palace Master Yan, does your Wan Hua Palace face such dangers every time someone comes here every ten years?” During a rest, Ling Taixu asked. The last time he had come was fifty years ago, and although there were demonic beasts blocking the way, it was nothing compared to the frequency of attacks this time.

The old woman pondered for a moment and replied, “No, this time is indeed unusual. Something must have happened in the Ghostly Underworld Mountain, causing even the weaker demonic beasts to be driven to the outskirts.”

Upon hearing her words, both Ling Taixu and Gui Li’s expressions changed slightly.

“This place is not suitable for lingering; we should continue on our way,” the old woman suggested, sensing the unease.

The group set off again, and half a day later, they finally arrived at their destination without further incident.

Ahead lay a vast lake, its waters clear and shimmering, yet the calm surface exuded a strange aura that made Yang Kai feel a sense of unease.

From a distance, he could see clusters of people gathered at the lake's edge. These individuals were experts from various factions of the Great Han Dynasty, bringing their disciples for training. Their numbers varied, with some groups having as many as seven or eight, while others had only three or four.

The groups maintained a distance of about thirty zhang from each other, encircling the lake’s edge.

Upon seeing Ling Taixu and his party, the others displayed faint displeasure and wariness.

The old woman from Wan Hua Palace nodded slightly to Ling Taixu, then led the beautiful woman and the four young girls toward the lake.

The arrival of this group of charming individuals immediately attracted the attention of countless young men. The young girls were accustomed to such attention and showed little emotional response, obediently following the old woman and finding an unoccupied spot to stop.

Gui Li gave Ling Taixu a sinister smile and cast a meaningful glance at Yang Kai.

Jin Hao snorted coldly and made a gesture of cutting his throat toward Yang Kai, before following Gui Li and heading in the opposite direction from Wan Hua Palace.

“We should find a place too!” Ling Taixu said, leading Yang Kai closer to the lake.

Most of the spots along the lake had already been claimed by the earlier arrivals, and after walking for a long time, Ling Taixu and Yang Kai still hadn’t found a suitable place to stay.

However, each time they passed a group of people, Ling Taixu would quietly transmit his voice, informing Yang Kai of the factions to which these people belonged, whether they were righteous or evil, the strength of the participating disciples, and what sects to be cautious of.

Yang Kai silently took note, maintaining a calm demeanor.

After circling more than half of the lake, they finally found an unoccupied area, and Ling Taixu visibly relaxed.

Once settled, the two sat cross-legged, and Ling Taixu began to detail the various factions around the lake to Yang Kai. Yang Kai listened attentively while secretly observing.

The more he learned, the more he sensed the dangers of this trial.

All these factions belonged to the Great Han Dynasty, most of which were first or second-rate sects, with some third-rate sects present as well. Each faction had brought at least two or three disciples, making Yang Kai’s solitary venture quite rare.

Ling Taixu had originally wanted to bring a couple more people to accompany Yang Kai, but there were simply no suitable candidates in Lingxiao Pavilion.

Su Yan could have been a choice, but she cultivated the Ice Heart Technique, and too much killing would not benefit her. Xia Ningshang was also a possibility, but she was a treasured disciple of Meng Wuya, who would never allow her to take such risks. As for Jie Hongchen and the like, Ling Taixu didn’t even consider them; bringing him along would only hinder Yang Kai.

The strength of the young people arriving at the lakeside was all superior to Yang Kai, with most being at the Separation and Union Realm, and many True Essence Realm experts were present.

It was good news that no one from the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu had been seen.

“Only True Essence Realm and below martial artists can enter for training, so you need not worry about encountering masters of the Divine Roaming Realm inside. With your strength, you should be able to handle an opponent at the True Essence Realm’s second or third layer, but if you encounter someone stronger, my only advice is—run! A man must know when to take up and when to let go; do not be overly stubborn and competitive. Taking up is strength, and letting go is wisdom!”

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“Remember, there is only one task inside: to survive. If you want to grow stronger, you don’t necessarily have to fight; hunting demonic beasts is also a means of becoming stronger.

I estimate that many will have this mindset. If you find someone truly trustworthy, it’s worth forming a temporary alliance; this is also a way to survive.”

“Understood. Master, who are those people over there? Their attire seems rather peculiar,” Yang Kai suddenly gestured with his eyes toward the distance.

Ling Taixu focused his gaze and frowned slightly. He saw a group of people whose clothing and appearance were subtly different from the others.

As if sensing Ling Taixu and Yang Kai’s gaze, the group turned to look back, their expressions cold and fierce, exuding a strong warning.

“They are not from the Great Han Dynasty!” Ling Taixu said softly. “They are from the Tianlang Kingdom.”

“The Tianlang Kingdom has come too?” Yang Kai was astonished. The Tianlang Kingdom was adjacent to the Great Han Dynasty; why would their sects travel such a long distance to this forbidden area?

“The martial culture in Tianlang is fierce, and it is said that most martial artists there are ruthless. Moreover, they are not of our kind, so you must be cautious if you encounter them. The strength of this group is not something you can withstand.”

“They do dress quite revealingly,” Yang Kai observed with interest. Among the group from the Tianlang Kingdom, there were two women with alluring figures, their clothing scant, exposing their arms. Their tight-fitting tops could barely contain their ample bosoms, as if they were about to burst forth. Their midriffs and delicate navels were also visible, and their lower garments only reached the knees, revealing a glimpse of their snowy legs.

“Ah…” Ling Taixu shook his head helplessly, still unable to comprehend how someone as simple-minded as the eldest could have a son like Yang Kai, who was so lecherous.

As time passed, more and more people arrived at the lakeside. It was unclear what rules governed their spacing, but various factions maintained a certain distance from each other, quietly waiting.

In less than a day, a circle of people had gathered around the lake.

With no space left for newcomers, they naturally turned their attention to the areas occupied by the weaker factions. A few careless words led to violent clashes.

In just one hour, four or five battles erupted, and a small faction was nearly wiped out, with both the older generation and the young disciples being slaughtered.

The bloody and brutal scene did not attract anyone's attention; those who dared to come here had to be prepared for conflict. If one was outmatched and killed, they had no one to blame.

Fortunately, although there were only two of them, Ling Taixu and Yang Kai had not drawn anyone's attention, thus avoiding much trouble.

However, this good fortune did not last long. As more and more factions arrived, Ling Taixu and Yang Kai eventually caught someone’s eye.

An elder, not much older than Ling Taixu, approached with a young man and woman, stopping about ten zhang away from Ling Taixu.

Ling Taixu sat cross-legged on the ground, opened his eyes to look at him, his expression calm.

Yang Kai remained vigilant but was somewhat surprised that he did not sense any hostility or killing intent from the newcomer.

The elder pondered for a moment, then cupped his fists toward Ling Taixu and said, “I am Zhuo Wen from the Yingyue Sect. May I ask your esteemed name?”

“Ling Taixu of Lingxiao Pavilion!”

“Ah, so it’s Brother Ling!” Zhuo Wen clearly recognized the name of Lingxiao Pavilion. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he got straight to the point, “Brother Ling, I apologize. I have brought my disciples through mountains and rivers, and we arrived a bit late. I didn’t expect so many factions to come for this trial, leaving us without a place to stay.”

Ling Taixu had crossed over thousands of li directly to arrive, so although he set off later, he had arrived relatively early. In contrast, Zhuo Wen from Yingyue Sect had set out a month prior but was delayed by the arduous journey through the Ghostly Underworld Mountain, arriving two days later than Ling Taixu.

“What does Brother Zhuo wish to discuss?” Since the other party bore no malice, Ling Taixu felt no need to be unfriendly. Though he had guessed the other’s intentions, he still asked.

Zhuo Wen chuckled awkwardly and said, “I would like to make a request to Brother Ling. The floating raft can carry four people at a time, and I see that Brother Ling only has one disciple with him. Would it be possible for my two disciples to hitch a ride? Otherwise, I would return empty-handed, and my disciples would be disappointed.”

Ling Taixu turned his gaze to the two young disciples behind Zhuo Wen.

The two quickly stepped forward, with the male disciple saying, “I am Chen Xueshu, greetings to Senior Ling.”

The female disciple added, “I am Shu Xiaoyu, greetings to Senior Ling.”

Both performed the disciple's salute, their demeanor respectful, showing no signs of dissatisfaction or arrogance. Ling Taixu observed their behavior and nodded inwardly. Like Lingxiao Pavilion, Yingyue Sect was also a second-rate sect, and their disciples were not known for being wicked. Moreover, the young man and woman appeared gentle and did not seem like the type to seek trouble.

Seeing Ling Taixu in thought, Zhuo Wen quickly added, “Brother Ling, rest assured, my two disciples are kind-hearted. Their purpose in this trial is solely to hunt demonic beasts and seek opportunities; they would never do anything harmful to your disciple. I can guarantee that with my head!”

He then supplemented, “If this young brother does not mind, he can also team up with my two disciples once inside. They can look out for each other.”

Ling Taixu had his own considerations but still turned to Yang Kai and asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Kai shrugged nonchalantly, “It’s fine to enter together, but as for teaming up, let’s skip that.”

They were all strangers; although Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu seemed decent, one could never truly know a person’s heart. Moreover, even if Yang Kai trusted them, it was uncertain whether they would trust him. Zhuo Wen’s words were merely polite; they could not be taken at face value.
