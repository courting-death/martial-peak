## Chapter 1365 — Requisitioning Dragon Lair Mountain

In truth, such baseless accusations had no footing at all; the people of Yingyue Hall knew it, and so did the other powers.

But who ordered the Imperial Garden to hover above Yingyue Hall's territory? Everyone feared Yingyue Hall's advantageous position, yet no one dared say so plainly; with a matter of this magnitude now at hand, it was only natural for people to make a great fuss.

After bargaining and even quarrelling, the major powers on Dark Star finally reached a consensus: even if the Imperial Garden opened, Yingyue Hall's many masters could not enter early. They must wait until the other forces had assembled before making any move, otherwise they would become the common enemy.

Yingyue Hall's situation now could not be called precarious, yet it was far from good; after all, it had recently suffered internal strife, leaving hearts unsettled and in need of rest and recovery. Faced with this unfair proposal, they could only agree.

And now, Tianyun City was practically overflowing with people. Every major force had stationed large numbers of their members there, and the inns and guesthouses throughout Tianyun City were already packed to capacity, their business booming beyond measure.

Even some of the smaller surrounding families could not avoid having to take in a few guests, providing lodging for those contingents.

Where crowds gather, conflicts follow; the great powers on Dark Star were by no means harmonious—there was much rivalry and old grudges between them. Once they crossed paths, a few harsh words could easily ignite a brawl.

Almost every day a martial artist died. As host, Yingyue Hall naturally stayed out of these external squabbles; as long as their own interests were not harmed, they observed silently.

In the stone residence, Yang Kai, at Yang Yan's request, poured spatial force into those odd objects while listening to her speak, occasionally cutting in to ask a question. Yang Yan answered each in turn.

While they were busy, Yang Yan suddenly changed expression, retrieving a Transmission Compass from the Spatial Ring. She probed it with her divine sense, then looked at Yang Kai oddly, a teasing expression on her face.

"What's wrong?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Someone's come looking for you," Yang Yan smiled, an amused depth in her tone. "An old acquaintance of yours."

"An old acquaintance?" Yang Kai's face darkened. He hardly knew anyone on Dark Star. Few had become true friends. Yang Yan's description puzzled him; for a moment he couldn't recall who might come, and the way she said "old acquaintance" carried a strange undertone.

"Who is it?" Yang Kai stopped guessing.

"Daiyuan!" Yang Yan answered with a bright smile.

"Her…" Yang Kai frowned. Had it been anyone else he could have claimed to be away from Dragon Lair Mountain and avoided meeting them. But Daiyuan was different. After all, she had once given him a glazed pearl that had benefitted him greatly. Moreover, the Stone Puppet had last time unearthed a passage out of her Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain; Yang Kai didn't know whether the Liuli Sect had discovered that afterward. Perhaps she could be used to sound things out.

Thinking so, Yang Kai rose and said, "I'll go see."

With that said, he headed outside.

Before long he reached the great formation at Dragon Lair Mountain. He produced a token and infused it with Saint Yuan; a mystic light shot forth from the token, and the sealing formation of Dragon Lair Mountain immediately split open, leaving a straight path to the outside.

Yang Kai had barely taken a step when a clamour of voices reached him from outside. His curiosity piqued—could it be that Daiyuan had not come alone? As he listened to the words from outside, his expression darkened and his pace quickened.

Outside the formation at Dragon Lair Mountain, Daiyuan stood there as graceful as ever; from her back alone, anyone might mistake her for a peerless beauty. That lithe silhouette seemed to possess a kind of enchantment that dragged at men's hearts, pulling them ever deeper into longing.

But if one turned to look at her face, no one could link her with the word "beautiful."

Daiyuan's complexion was dark-yellow as before, her face marred and coarse, and she displayed it openly without veil, unashamed.

At her side stood a group of a dozen or so cultivators, all dressed in matching attire but of varying cultivation levels. Many of them openly showed expressions of disgust as they pointed and whispered about her. Among them, several women lifted their smooth chins slightly, wearing looks of superiority as though they were above everyone else.

They were not particularly comely, but next to Daiyuan's face each one seemed a beauty, which inflated their sense of superiority.

"Hey, I'm talking to you—are you mute or what?" the leader of the group shouted at Daiyuan.

Daiyuan turned her head and cast him a cool glance, showing no intention of replying.

That indifferent attitude instantly enraged the leading cultivator. He sneered and said, “You damned woman, don’t think you can act so high and mighty! Don’t assume that just because you’re a woman, this young master wouldn’t dare lay a hand on you. You may be a bit ugly, but you’re still a woman after all—I was giving you some face. Don’t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit.”

Daiyuan's brows twitched and a trace of disgust passed over her face, but she soon returned to calm.

In the past, such words would have set her off into a fight—her looks had once been a sore spot. But after Yang Kai had cleansed the poison from her, her appearance had been restored; the current ugliness was merely a disguise. So even though the words were harsh, she did not take them to heart.

"Senior Brother Hai, why waste words on her? Just seize her. She came looking for someone inside, so she must have connections there. We've waited here for days while the host has not shown his face—it's as if they don't think much of us," another in the crowd said impatiently, eager for action.

"Oh? And who should I be holding in regard?" a mocking voice suddenly came from within Dragon Lair Mountain, and at once the facing formation split open as a young man's figure emerged.

"Yang Kai!" Daiyuan's face brightened and she hurried forward.

"Miss Daiyuan!" Yang Kai lightly inclined his head, then glanced at the group outside and asked casually, "Are these people with you?"

Daiyuan shook her head and said softly, "They are disciples of Haixin Sect."

"Haixin Sect? Never heard of them," Yang Kai sneered. Though he did not yet fully grasp the distribution and strength of all forces on Dark Star, he knew of the larger powers; Haixin Sect was unknown to him, which suggested it was insignificant.

Daiyuan, however, had a broader acquaintance—otherwise she could not judge their origin from their clothing. She said in a low voice, "They are a force from Wuyou Sea; it makes sense you haven't heard of them."

"I see." Yang Kai understood. Wuyou Sea was a long way off; they would never have come here if not for the Imperial Garden's appearance.

"You are the master of this place?" the leader of Haixin Sect sized Yang Kai up and asked in surprise.

"Indeed, I am the owner here," Yang Kai grinned.

“Perfect. Since you’re the master of this place, you can speak for it,” the cultivator said. Seeing that Yang Kai’s cultivation wasn’t high—only at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm—he couldn’t help showing a trace of disdain, his expression tinged with arrogance as he continued, “We are disciples of Haixin Sect from Wuyou Sea. This mountain range has now been requisitioned by our sect! Go back and tell the people inside to pack up and clear out some space for us.”

He spoke as if issuing orders to subordinates, utterly unceremonious.

Daiyuan's expression turned odd; she glanced at Yang Kai, wondering if they had taken him for the head of a small local clan under Yingyue Hall.

Yang Kai had the same thought. Though he had not immediately understood the situation upon emerging, a moment's thought let him piece together the outline.

Tianyun City was teeming with people these days; many outsiders could not find lodging, so the nearby small families had become targets. To better watch the Imperial Garden's movements, the visitors naturally sought the best positions.

Dragon Lair Mountain sat almost directly beneath the Imperial Garden—an ideal location—so of course many turned their eyes to it.

In fact, over recent days many martial artists from various powers had coveted Dragon Lair Mountain, hoping to enter and lodge within its depths. But Dragon Lair Mountain's formations were exquisite; some sensed the place's unusualness and dared not meddle rashly.

Others knew the mountain's master was a young man who had once slain an Origin Returning Realm expert and kept good relations with Qian Tong, so they would not dare intrude. Haixin Sect, however, came from Wuyou Sea and knew nothing of Dragon Lair Mountain or Yang Kai, so such behavior was inevitable.

There were countless secrets hidden within Dragon Lair Mountain, with layer upon layer of grand formations protecting it. Never mind Haixin Sect—even if people from the Battle Sky Alliance or the Leitai Sect came, Yang Kai would not let them in. All the more ridiculous was how these people spoke as if it were only natural, as though being allowed to stay at Dragon Lair Mountain were some kind of honor for them. The thought left Yang Kai both angry and amused.

To demand the mountain by a single word of "requisition"—Haixin Sect's arrogance knew no bounds.

That thought passed through Yang Kai's mind. He rolled his eyes and gave a soft chuckle, clasping his hands in salute. "Ah, friends of Haixin Sect—I've long admired your renown."

His expression was one of feigned admiration, which made the members of Haixin Sect feel exceedingly pleased. Each of them thought with pride that their sect’s reputation must be immense if it had even spread as far as Yingyue Hall. The leader, full of self-satisfaction, turned to glance smugly at his junior brothers and sisters before facing Yang Kai again. Smiling faintly, he said, “No need for pleasantries. Since you know we’re from Haixin Sect, hurry and make the arrangements. The dozen of us don’t mind much, but when my Senior Uncle arrives, you’d better serve him well. His temper isn’t the best—if he’s displeased, you should know what that means.”

The threat was heavily implied in his words, as if a single poor fault in service would bring calamity upon Dragon Lair Mountain.
