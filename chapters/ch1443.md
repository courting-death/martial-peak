## Chapter 1443 — Shocking News

Half an hour later, Yang Kai drew a light breath, stepped forward, came before the corpse of that demonic beast, bent down, thrust his hand into its belly, and took out its musk gland and inner core.

A strange fragrance wafted out; when inhaled it soothed the mind and brought an unrivaled sense of ease.

This demonic beast truly bore a blood relationship to the Seven‑Colored Stag; even if not directly related, it must be the product of hybrid breeding. Its musk gland and inner core, though not suitable for refining exotic treasures like Ten‑Thousand‑Year Incense, could be used to concoct pills to resist heart demons.

Such pills are exceedingly precious, the very things martial artists covet most when breaking major thresholds, and the hardest to obtain; a single pill is worth a fortune. In the hands of a pill‑refiner like Yang Kai, the musk gland and inner core would certainly yield tremendous effects and unimaginable value!

The earlier battle was not especially perilous for Yang Kai, yet it did consume some effort.

Relying on the Space Blade alone, Yang Kai could not have slain it—the beast’s speed was truly too great; when things turned sour it even tried to flee! Yang Kai could not allow it to escape, and immediately produced his Formation Talisman for the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation, transforming it into a sea of clouds to envelop the creature.

Using the might of the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation, he trapped it, and only then was he able to secure it.

The Formation Talisman of the Light‑Splitting Cloud Sea Formation was something Yang Kai had brought out from the Imperial Garden; its marvels are profound. When Fei Zhi Tu and the others were once trapped within it, they suffered greatly. With Yang Kai’s current strength, combined with the Space Blade and the Golden Blood Threads, the demonic beast could not possibly survive.

The inner core and musk gland were the most precious parts of the creature, but the flesh of a peak Ninth‑Tier demonic beast must not be wasted. Yang Kai thought for a moment, produced the Dripping Jade Dragon‑Bone Sword and circulated Saint Yuan into it.

The Dragon‑Bone Sword immediately transformed into a verdant little dragon one zhang long, swallowed the beast’s corpse whole, and after a moment spat it back out. Only a withered husk remained. Its blood and flesh essence seemed to have been thoroughly devoured.

Yang Kai revealed a faint smile; the Dragon‑Bone Sword is a secret treasure that can grow. By consuming the blood and flesh essence of enemies, its power steadily increases.

Satisfied, he put it away, then sent out a few more strands of Saint Yuan to withdraw from the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation. Retrieving the Formation Talisman, Yang Kai finally turned to glance in the direction the five had departed. Behind him, the roar of wind and thunder erupted as the Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurled—his figure blurred, and in the next instant, he vanished from sight.

At the same time, a thousand li from here, in a natural cavern, the five who had earlier battled the demonic beast—all of them Origin Returning Realm—had gathered together.

This cavern had once been the lair of some demonic beast, perhaps a kind of python, but it had been abandoned for a long time; the environment was dry, so the five used it as a temporary resting place.

A crude concealment array had been set up outside.

“That variant of the Seven‑Colored Stag still has not come; it seems the brat drew it away—good, good. Though that youngster’s cultivation is not high, he must have learned some escape secret art; his speed is not slow,” the black‑haired elder said with delight after probing outside with his Divine Sense for a long time.

“Given his cultivation, I fear it will be difficult for him to escape the beast,” the youngest of them, a delicate woman with the lowest attainment, displayed a trace of gloom on her face, as if ashamed.

“What others live or die has nothing to do with us. This trip to the Imperial Garden was supposed to be full of surprises, but it has been fraught with the unexpected and beset by thorns at every step. For the five of us to survive until now is already a fluke—how can we bother about others?” the white‑haired elder snorted coldly.

A middle‑aged woman among them also spoke: “Indeed, I did not expect the Imperial Garden to be so perilous. Our group of ten has been reduced to five; had we not withdrawn early, we would likely have perished as well.”

“Ah!” The black-haired elder sighed softly, then said with self-mockery, “Truly, the older one gets, the smaller one’s courage becomes. Though the Imperial Garden is filled with dangers, it holds no shortage of opportunities as well. If it were in my younger days, I’d never have backed out. But now that I’m old, I keep hesitating and worrying—no longer as fearless as I once was!”

The white‑haired elder nodded in agreement, saying, “Yes, in those days we dared to go anywhere. Even dragon‑pits and tiger‑dens we would charge into. But now……”

Another long sigh escaped.

For a time the cavern was quiet, only the faint breaths of the five could be heard.

About half a cup of tea later, a calm, resonant voice sounded from outside: “This Yang greets you all. I have a few matters to consult about—might I come in and speak with you?”

The voice reached their ears plainly, and the five meditating in the cavern all changed color. The white‑haired elder immediately shouted sternly: “Who goes there?”

That someone had entered yet not been detected at once filled the white‑haired elder with alarm; he secretly felt fortunate the intruder had not struck—had he harbored any malice, the five might already be trapped.

A cheerful laugh came from outside: “We have only just parted, do you already not remember me? Ah, allow me to introduce myself first—this one is Yang Kai!”

“Yang Kai?” the few frowned, but when their Divine Sense swept outward they all showed astonishment.

“It’s actually that brat from before!”

“He didn’t die, and he even escaped that demonic beast? How is that possible?”

The five exchanged glances, curious about how Yang Kai had managed to escape the demonic beast, but they also had reservations; after all, when the five fled they had intended to use Yang Kai as a shield, and now that he had come over, they did not know what to make of it.

“Brother Min……” the black‑haired elder looked to the white‑haired elder with some hesitation.

“Never mind; judging by his tone he does not seem to be here for vengeance. Besides, his cultivation is not high—does he even have the ability to seek revenge? Let him come in,” the white‑haired elder said with ease. He did not blame the others for lacking perception; Yang Kai’s realm was clear, and alone he could not cause much trouble for the five of them.

The black‑haired elder waved and produced a stream of Saint Yuan to temporarily shut off the concealment array, and said politely, “Young friend, please enter.”

“Thank you!” Yang Kai smiled slightly, strode toward the cavern with no trace of guard, which left the five inside astonished.

Someone entering alone and so boldly—either he is foolish and ignorant of the world’s dangers, or he has backing. They thought the latter unlikely; so evidently the former.

That too made sense; the youth looked young yet possessed Origin Returning Realm cultivation. He was likely a disciple of some major power, long sequestered within his sect, not worldly.

Thinking this, the five’s expressions relaxed considerably.

Such a person would be easy to deal with.

The cave wasn’t large—roughly ten or so zhang across. Inside, it was pitch-black. After Yang Kai dropped in and glanced around, he gave a quiet nod to himself.

Though their earlier actions when fleeing had made him uncomfortable, now it seemed they were not great villains; otherwise, when he had fallen in they would certainly have taken the chance to ambush.

At least for now they showed no malice, and the small‑framed woman even gave him a slight nod. Another woman appeared somewhat reserved and embarrassed, as if guilty about what had happened earlier.

Not bad. Yang Kai had earlier thought that if these people were obstinate he would not spare them.

Now it seemed he’d saved himself some trouble.

“I am Yang Kai. Greetings to you all,” Yang Kai bowed slightly, smiling.

“Young friend Yang, you are too polite!” The white‑haired elder, seemingly their leader, introduced himself amiably without pressing Yang Kai about how he had escaped the demonic beast: “I am Min Sha, Island Lord of Songyue Island. These are my close friends.”

He wore an affable demeanor, as if nothing had happened before.

“Songyue Island?” Yang Kai frowned, puzzled.

But since the other claimed to be an Island Lord, it followed he must be from overseas; Yang Kai had never been overseas, so it made sense he had not heard of him. After all, the only overseas force he had dealings with was the Haixin Sect.

Yang Kai assumed as much, yet what Min Sha said next left him dumbstruck and frozen on the spot.

“Yes, Songyue Island is an island on Qingmu Star. Young friend naturally could not have heard of it; which star did you come from?” Min Sha asked.

“Qingmu Star?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened; he stared at Min Sha and the others in astonishment, his emotions turbulent.

But his mind was quick; though Min Sha had said little, Yang Kai extracted unexpected information from those two sentences and asked in alarm, “Island Lord Min, could it be that the Imperial Garden can be entered by martial artists from more than one star?”

At these words the five laughed.

Yang Kai scratched his head awkwardly and stood embarrassed, realizing he had surely asked the wrong question.

“Young friend Yang, are you from some outlying star?” Min Sha ventured.

“Island Lord Min is correct. The star I come from is indeed rather remote, so…” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“Ah, that explains it,” Min Sha said knowingly. “Our Qingmu Star is likewise remote, with poor contact to the outside. At first we thought only martial artists from our Qingmu Star could enter the Imperial Garden. But upon entering we discovered that martial artists from across the entire Star Domain can come. I looked into it and found that the Imperial Garden projects a phantom on each star; as long as one holds Imperial Jade, one can pass through the space array and be transported here.”

“I see……” Yang Kai murmured, saying casually, “The Dark Star where I come from is much the same as your Qingmu Star.”

“Dark Star?” The five all frowned; they had evidently never heard of it.

But even so, Qingmu Star, though remote and poorly connected, must be better off than Dark Star. Dark Star is almost completely isolated, unable to make contact with the rest of the Star Domain; Qingmu Star could hardly be like that.
