## Chapter 1371 — I'll Take You to See

“Then what shall we do?” Yang Yan asked, worry creasing her face.

“It’s fine. The reason she mentioned it was just to reassure me—most within Liuli Sect still know nothing about this matter. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have come here to ask me to refine an Origin Condensing Pill.”

“Even so, it’s best to stay cautious. After all, the Glazed Mountain is Liuli Sect’s treasured inheritance—if news of it leaks out, Liuli Sect will never let the matter rest.”

“I know what’s at stake,” Yang Kai nodded lightly. “By the way, Qian Yue isn’t in seclusion right now, is she?”

“She's not!” Yang Yan shook her head.

“Tell her to come to me — I need her.” With that Yang Kai turned and walked toward the stone residence.

Inside the stone residence, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his expression indifferent as if sunk in thought. Sensing someone approaching outside, he immediately opened the sealing array and let them in.

Sure enough, it was Qian Yue who arrived.

“Yang Kai, you called for me?” Qian Yue asked.

“Mm, sit.” Yang Kai gestured to her. Though puzzled, Qian Yue still came to him, sitting cross-legged on a meditation mat and peering around with interest.

Truth be told, aside from Yang Kai himself, Yang Yan visited this stone residence most often. Others rarely set foot here; only when the cultivators of Dragon Lair Mountain were about to break through a bottleneck did they come to the secret chamber outside the stone residence to seclude and cultivate, for there they could sense a trace of aura from the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree and the assistance of the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense — both greatly beneficial to breakthroughs.

This was Qian Yue's first time here, so naturally she was curious.

This place was one of the most secret locations on the whole of Dragon Lair Mountain.

“What did you want me for?” Qian Yue looked on for a moment before her expression turned serious as she spoke. She and Yang Kai were both from Tongxuan Continent. Many years ago her strength had been enough to look down on Yang Kai, but now... her fine cultivation environment and abundant resources all owed to Yang Kai, and his strength had long since surpassed hers.

So Qian Yue now treated Yang Kai like a peer, though a faint reverence lingered in her heart.

“I need a favor.”

Qian Yue smiled faintly. “All right, I've been fretting that there's nothing I can help with here. What do you need? Say it.”

“I need your Spirit Body to enter my Sea of Consciousness.” Yang Kai met her gaze and spoke with utter seriousness.

“Huh?” Qian Yue's face changed, astonishment written all over it. She never expected such a bizarre request. Allowing another's Spirit Body into one's Sea of Consciousness was no small matter — normally only done between those who trusted each other completely or were intimately connected.

After all, a person's Sea of Consciousness harbored too many private things; no one would lightly let outsiders see them.

The last time Yang Kai entered Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness it was because Yang Yan herself voluntarily lowered her Divine Sense defenses, trusting him utterly — otherwise he could never have forced his way in.

Hearing Yang Kai's request now, Qian Yue was naturally stunned and, at the same time, a little grateful.

Whatever Yang Kai's motives, by saying this he clearly did not regard her as an outsider.

“I can enter, but what do you want me to do? Is it to cultivate some secret art?” Qian Yue guessed aloud.

“No, don't read too much into it. I'm only asking you to find a place.” Yang Kai explained.

“Find a place?” Qian Yue furrowed her brow, even more confused. Why would finding a place require entering Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness?

“Find the place where you and Su Yan separated.” Yang Kai's face turned grave and his voice dropped. Before Qian Yue could ask, he added, “You'll understand once you're inside. Explaining it would be too troublesome.”

Though still bewildered, Qian Yue no longer demurred and nodded slightly. “Then lower your Sea of Consciousness defenses.”

Yang Kai inclined his head, closed his eyes, and sank his mind into his Sea of Consciousness. In the next instant his Spirit Body manifested, hovering over a section of his Sea of Consciousness.

Not long after, Yang Kai felt another wave of soul-energy rush into his Sea of Consciousness. Frowning, he did not resist but allowed it to surge in. Moments later a flash of light, and Qian Yue's Spirit Body revealed itself.

She had just appeared when she cried out softly, hurriedly using soul-force to fend off the heat assailing her from all directions.

Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness resembled Yang Yan's, only far more potent: the sea below burned like living flame. Qian Yue was only at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, so she was immediately affected.

Seeing this, Yang Kai waved his hand and a stream of soul-energy shot out to envelop Qian Yue, shielding her from the impact of the Divine Sense Fire.

“Your Sea of Consciousness... is truly dangerous.” Qian Yue's face showed lingering fear as she glanced around. With her eyesight she could tell Yang Kai's Divine Sense had mutated and grown immense; without his deliberate protection she could not have held out here long.

“Come.” Yang Kai beckoned and rose into the air, prompting his Divine Sense to move.

The next moment an incredible sight unfolded: the space above the Sea of Consciousness suddenly filled with countless stars, pinpricks of light clustered like swarms of fireflies. These star-like lights then fanned out rapidly and expanded, and Qian Yue felt a momentary blur, as if she were standing in the middle of the Starry Sky.

“This is…” Qian Yue looked around, astonished, realizing the scene had changed in an instant. Were she not fully aware she stood inside Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, she would have sworn she had again stepped into the Starry Sky.

Seeing this familiar sight, Qian Yue couldn't help recalling the trials she and others had suffered when they passed through the Starry Sky gate above the Ice Sect and entered the Star Domain.

Those stars were so immense and brilliant that they inspired dread, making one feel insignificant; the desperate Starry Sky storms and the boundless Meteorite Sea now unfolded before her eyes.

Thinking of the Ice Sect elders' gruesome deaths, Qian Yue's expression darkened.

Past scenes rushed back as if yesterday's events were replaying.

Yang Kai's figure appeared at her side. Qian Yue looked toward him, a trace of desolation showing in her beautiful eyes.

For her, Yang Kai might now be the only person she felt even remotely familiar with. She felt no belonging in the Star Domain and could not help whispering, “Yang Kai, I want to go back to Tongxuan Continent. I want to return to the Ice Sect.”

That vulnerable place deep in her soul seemed fully exposed by the scene before her, making her appear painfully delicate and frail.

A strange light flickered in Yang Kai's eyes as he said calmly, “That day will come, but before it does you must first strengthen yourself.”

His voice held something like a spell. Qian Yue listened and her eyes clouded with bewilderment. Yang Kai frowned and gave a low, sharp call.

The cry detonated like spring thunder in Qian Yue's ears, causing her to shiver. The weakness in her gaze vanished, replaced by her old vigor, and once she understood what had happened she could only show a mixture of fright and gratitude.

That eerie Starry Sky had opened a great flaw in her soul. Though it seemed small now, if left unchecked it would become a heart-demon — a deadly hazard when she attempted a breakthrough.

If a heart-demon erupted at the critical moment of a breakthrough, at best she'd fail and suffer backlash; at worst her soul might be utterly destroyed.

Yang Kai's words were faint, but he had used the impact of his own soul to rouse her from weakness and recollection.

Realizing this, Qian Yue couldn't help but feel grateful, and privately reflected that compared to Yang Kai's fortitude, she truly was not fit to bear such burdens.

After a deep breath to steady herself, she asked, “What is this? Why does your Sea of Consciousness contain such things?”

“A Star Chart.” Yang Kai stood beside her, staring at the stars near and far, each emanating light of varying strength.

He had obtained this Star Chart when he first entered the Star Domain, from a cartographer belonging to a Purple Star power named Wusuo.

No one knew what fate had befallen that cartographer Wusuo to grant him such a Star Chart. When the Purple Star's warship exploded he died miserably, and his soul-energy was devoured by Yang Kai. After Yang Kai purified his soul-energy with the World-Ending Demon Eye, the Star Chart remained.

Yang Kai had once probed the Star Chart, but without much effort; and after arriving at Dark Star he had no chance to use it, so he never truly studied it.

But since finding Qian Yue and learning that she and Su Yan were separated within the Starry Sky, Yang Kai began using the Star Chart within his Sea of Consciousness to search.

He had carefully questioned Qian Yue about the circumstances of where she separated from Su Yan and the others, and he had now found several similar locations; unable to be certain, he wanted Qian Yue to enter and help identify the correct one.

Yang Kai couldn't search for Su Yan personally right now, but if he could determine her approximate location he would at least have a direction to work toward.

He briefly explained the Star Chart's mysteries to Qian Yue, who listened with bright eyes, amazed that such wondrous things existed in the Star Domain.

Moreover, cartographers were a profession that almost didn’t exist on Dark Star. After all, Dark Star was completely sealed off from the outside world, making any external contact impossible. On rare occasions, someone might venture into the Starry Sky, but only to search nearby for ores and Saint Crystals—they would never go too far. Thus, for a cartographer, there was simply no future to be found on this star.

“You mean this Star Chart encompasses the stars of the entire Star Domain?” Qian Yue asked, equal parts shock and delight.

“Yes. Even if it doesn't cover every one, it shouldn't be far off.” Yang Kai nodded.

“What about Tongxuan Continent?” Qian Yue turned to him.

“Want to see it?” Yang Kai grinned.

Qian Yue nodded hard, her face eager and impatient.

“I'll take you to see.” Yang Kai waved his hand, enveloped Qian Yue in soul-energy, and they darted through the Star Domain conjured by the Star Chart.
