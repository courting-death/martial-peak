## Chapter 1439 — Tempering One's Own Shi

Compared to the various treasures and benefits in the Imperial Garden, one's own strength is the foundation; everything else is merely external force.

Which matters more and which matters less—Yang Kai naturally understood.

So even if he entered the Imperial Garden a bit later, it didn’t matter; as long as this plan succeeded, the gains he would obtain would far exceed the treasures found within the Imperial Garden!

It was precisely because of these considerations that Yang Kai grew eager to try.

Yang Yan made no move to stop him. After pondering for a moment, she said, “Then act according to your own limits—don’t be reckless. I have the Great Elder guarding me here, so you needn’t worry about anything.”

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded slightly, turned to Ye Xijun, and cupped his fist, "Senior Ye, Yang Yan is entrusted to you."

"Rest assured, while I still draw breath, no one may harm the Lord!" Ye Xijun declared proudly.

Yang Kai grinned and waved his hand. “Go on. If possible, I’ll find you inside the Imperial Garden and meet up with you there!”

Yang Yan glanced at him, gave a few more admonitions, and then continued flying upward. After a moment she halted, turned, and called out, "Yang Kai!"

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled as he looked at her.

“For these past days… thank you.” Yang Yan gave him a radiant smile, and with those seemingly out-of-place words, she set off again and quickly disappeared into the distance.

Yang Kai looked bewildered, frowning at her retreating figure, unable to grasp what the woman meant or why she had grown so sentimental all of a sudden. He shook his head to stop himself from overthinking; right now using Imperial Might to temper his own Shi was the paramount task.

With that thought, Yang Kai resumed ascending upward in an unhurried, measured fashion.

Every martial artist, upon advancing to the Origin Returning Realm, begins to temper their own Shi! No one is an exception.

Shi is a mysterious force, hard to define and harder to grasp. It differs from a cultivator’s outward aura; rather, it is the fusion of one’s essence, energy, and spirit. Once cultivated to perfection, it becomes a formidable power in battle!

A practitioner can even integrate their cultivated secrets and divine techniques into their Shi, allowing it to unleash unimaginable effects.

However, tempering Shi is extremely arduous, requiring years of perception and fusion; only by refining Shi to a consummate state can a martial artist ascend to the Void King Realm!

This is one of the necessary conditions for advancement.

Across the entire Dark Star, Origin Returning Realm practitioners are countless, and there are a considerable number at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet among them perhaps only one percent—or even fewer—have refined their Shi to consummation.

Ye Xijun was undoubtedly one of them!

As for Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, it was hard to say; they might have reached consummation, they might not. Experts like Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng most likely had not attained that level. So even when practitioners share the same cultivation rank—both masters of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—their demonstrated power differs; the reason is Shi.

If an Origin Returning Realm cultivator refines their own Shi, their combat strength will rise sharply—at the very least, by thirty to forty percent.

Thirty peak Saint Realm warriors might possibly defeat a First Stage Saint King.

But thirty peak Saint King Realm warriors are absolutely no match for an Origin Returning First Stage practitioner who possesses Shi; the difference is plain to see, because once one falls into the opponent’s Shi, whether it is the operation of Saint Yuan or the efficacy of secret techniques, everything is greatly diminished—unless one has cultivated methods specifically to break Shi, such as the Demon Blood Sect’s Demon Blood Threads!

Yang Kai had long made plans for how to temper his own Shi.

Although he had only broken through to the Origin Returning Realm a few days earlier, the souls of so many Origin Returning experts had not been wasted, and the firsthand experiences passed down orally by Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu, Wei Guchang, and Xuan’er had greatly aided him.

He had prepared for this long in advance, and now the time had finally come to use it.

In the sky Yang Kai’s figure stood straight as a sword. Saint Yuan condensed within him yet did not release, roaring and circulating inside his body.

Above him there seemed to be an invisible staircase that allowed him to climb step by step. His expression was calm, strolling as if in a courtyard, showing no sign of strain.

At this time and place, the Imperial Might was not overwhelmingly strong; it could only slightly affect the operation of his Saint Yuan, yet Yang Kai used this suppression to quietly ponder and experience, melding his spirit, essence, and vigor into one.

As he continued to ascend, the Imperial Might cloaking his body gradually intensified until it reached a degree that made even his every step a struggle.

Each movement seemed to consume enormous power; explosive crackling noises came from his body, dense and frightening like crushed beans. The Imperial Might’s shroud not only slowed his motion but also greatly reduced the speed of his Saint Yuan’s circulation.

It was as if he stood in a quagmire, even the space itself growing viscous and sticky.

Yang Kai’s face contorted; veins on his neck stood out, his eyes bloodshot—he looked like a crazed beast.

Although in a pitiable state, the joy deep within those eyes was unmistakable.

Using Imperial Might to temper his Shi truly had wondrous effects! The Imperial Might that pressed on every inch of his flesh, every cell, became a miraculous catalyst that brought his spirit, essence, and energy into unprecedented harmony.

It made him faintly comprehend what Shi was and how to temper his own Shi.

Tilting his head to gaze at the void, Yang Kai once more forced himself to take a painful step.

The distance of that step was only a single zhang, but to Yang Kai it felt as if decades—or even longer—had passed!

The enormous pressure of Imperial Might not only made his actions slow but also dulled his thoughts and sensations. This slowness was not obvious to outsiders, but for Yang Kai it was an extremely rare experience.

That single zhang’s distance let him experience wonders that ordinary practitioners would need to spend a great deal of time to attain.

After placing his foot down, Yang Kai clenched his eyes shut; the Saint Yuan within his body thundered and circulated, and he even felt, to some degree, it breaking free from the Imperial Might’s shackles, operating somewhat faster than before.

After a long time he opened his eyes again, stepped upward once more, then closed his eyes to feel the changes within himself—repeating this cycle over and over.

The advantage of a powerful body finally manifested at this moment; if Yang Kai’s physical body had not been strong enough, he could never have endured to this point—under the suppression of Imperial Might he would have suffered grievous injury.

It was also fortunate that earlier he had refined the Undying Five Elements Sword to the First Stage, greatly increasing his bodily strength.

The newly achieved Origin Returning Realm stabilized and solidified at an incredible speed.

This set of insights saved Yang Kai a great deal of seated cultivation; otherwise, relying solely on meditation to stabilize the realm would have taken at least a year or two.

Even this single benefit made the trip well worth it.

But Yang Kai was not satisfied; he pressed on with arduous ascent, still immersed in his own comprehension as if forgetting everything around him.

After a full day Yang Kai had climbed more than ten thousand zhang—this distance was not remarkable, and he was still far from the Imperial Garden, yet by doing so he had gained insights ordinary practitioners would spend hundreds of years acquiring, touching upon deeper laws of the Martial Dao.

A dense, invisible force spread outward from him as its center, clashing head-on with the power of the Imperial Might.

Shi!

That was Yang Kai’s Shi! Although, compared to the unfathomable Imperial Might, this Shi was like a newly hatched bird breaking its shell and hardly worth mentioning, it was undeniably a miracle!

No warrior could condense their Shi to even a small degree in merely one day!

If one told others of this, few would believe it.

Yet Yang Kai seized this rare opportunity and achieved it.

The Imperial Might radiating from the Imperial Garden was more direct, clearer, and more impactful than what he had felt at the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

Previously martial artists had gone to the Fallen Emperor Mountains to feel that wondrous Imperial Might in order to temper their shi, and many had benefited greatly.

Yang Kai was doing the same in a place superior even to the Fallen Emperor Mountains, so the effect was naturally doubly efficient. But this was only the beginning—far from finished.

Resolute, he continued slowly climbing while comprehending and experiencing those marvels.

On that day others finally caught up with Yang Kai—those who had set out from the outskirts of the Flowing Flame Sandland toward the Imperial Garden. Bypassing the flame barrier had wasted them much effort, and one by one they were burning with impatience, fearful that others would get there first and snatch the Imperial Garden’s benefits.

As they passed by Yang Kai, everyone couldn’t help but glance at him in shock, their faces showing expressions as if they had seen a ghost in broad daylight.

They could easily resist the Imperial Might and ascend because they had activated the protective effect of the Imperial Jade; with that protective shield they would not suffer the Imperial Might’s pressure.

But here they saw Yang Kai using his own power to resist Imperial Might.

How could that not astonish them?

Among them were many whose names were widely known on the Dark Star, cultivation at the Second or Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet even so, none would casually remove the Imperial Jade’s shield.

A few skeptical experts, seeing Yang Kai’s arrogance, felt competitive and retracted their Imperial Jade, but in an instant their speed dropped and they were quickly left far behind.

Though not instantly slain, the sensation of being wrapped by Imperial Might was unpleasant; thinking of the benefits within the Imperial Garden, they had to re-activate the Imperial Jade’s power and flew past Yang Kai not far off.

Not everyone had Yang Kai’s boldness—willing to sacrifice time that could be spent seeking the Imperial Garden’s treasures in order to temper their Shi.

Besides, not everyone could truly ignore Yang Kai. Most were still shaken by his astonishing feat, yet with their minds set on the Imperial Garden, they quickly departed all the same.

Yet several experts from factions that bore grudges against Yang Kai passed by with eager looks, seemingly intent on taking action to eliminate him.

Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect not only thought so but acted.
