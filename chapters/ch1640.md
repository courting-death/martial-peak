## Chapter 1640 — Whether They Like It Or Not

Not long after, Wei Qing returned with a young man.

The youth looked presentable, but his hawk-hooked nose and conspicuous black eye sockets ruined the overall appeal, and his aura was shallow—at a glance he was the sort who indulged in wine and women, all show and no substance.

When he arrived he staggered, his face pale, constantly swallowing, his eyes brimming with terror and dread as he stared at Chi Huo.

Although he was already in the Origin Returning Realm, he acted like an ordinary person with no strength, hiding behind Wei Qing to seek shelter and not daring to face Chi Huo's authority.

Chi Huo glanced at him, snorted coldly; the contempt and disdain on his face were unmistakable.

"Grand Elder, I've brought Feng'er," Wei Qing said in a hoarse voice.

"Alright, you may step back," Chi Huo waved Wei Qing off.

Wei Qing opened his mouth as if to speak, but ultimately said nothing; he merely sighed, glanced back at his son, slowly shook his head, and hurried away.

Wei Feng panicked, looked at his father's retreating figure with tearful eyes and cried out, "Father..."

"Shut up!" Chi Huo barked.

Wei Feng flinched as if frightened out of his wits, nearly dropping to the ground, and turned to look at Chi Huo in terror, his face turning even paler.

He had no idea why the Grand Elder had summoned him. Within the Fire Radiance Sect his status was remarkable, and he could rely on his father's power to do as he pleased—but here before the Grand Elder he wasn't worth a fart.

If the Grand Elder wanted him dead, not even his father could stop it.

"Grand Elder... Grand Elder. Your disciple these days has been... been closed-door cultivating within the Sect, and has not committed... committed any mistakes. I beg the Grand Elder's clear judgment—please do not kill... kill me!" Wei Feng suddenly burst into tears, thudded to his knees and stammered, shouting as he repeatedly struck his head against the ground until it rattled.

The contempt and loathing in Chi Huo's eyes only deepened.

Luo Hai beside him slowly shook his head and frowned, "Wei Qing may be the future pillar of the Fire Radiance Sect, but how did his son end up like this?"

"A doting mother spoils her child!" Chi Huo snorted coldly. He glared at Wei Feng and shouted, "Stand up for me!"

Wei Feng cried out and hurriedly rose, still hunched over. Tears streamed down uncontrollably as he forced a flattering smile, looking at Chi Huo with a pitiable expression far worse than crying.

"Straighten your back, you good-for-nothing!" Chi Huo was full of fury. He strode forward and slapped Wei Feng across the cheek twice.

Two sharp slaps rang out; Wei Feng felt as if his face had been wiped away, numb all over.

Chi Huo was a Void King Realm expert; even without using any power, two casual slaps were enough to pulverize Wei Feng—fortunately Wei Feng had use, so Chi Huo certainly wouldn't kill him here.

Grasping Wei Feng by the neck like a chick and lifting him up, Chi Huo said coldly, "Kid, your luck's come. Didn't you have your eye on a female disciple from Ice Heart Valley? I'll take you to Icebound Island to fetch her!"

"Ah?" Wei Feng was stunned, staring at Chi Huo in bewilderment—he hadn't expected the Grand Elder to summon him for such a thing.

After a moment's daze, Wei Feng was overjoyed and asked eagerly, "Is the Grand Elder serious?"

Su Yan's ice-sculpted, jade-polished face suddenly flashed before him, setting his whole body aflame.

"Would the Grand Elder jest with you?" Chi Huo sneered with a feral grin.

"But... but what if Ice Heart Valley refuses?" Wei Feng asked anxiously.

“They have no right to refuse. You’re the Sect Master’s son, after all—your status is far from ordinary. For a disciple of Ice Heart Valley to catch your eye is her good fortune. Whether they like it or not, they’ll have to hand her over!”

"Then that's settled..." Wei Feng's excitement and elation completely overshadowed his fear of Chi Huo. He nodded repeatedly, already imagining the pleasures of getting Su Yan, a foolish grin plastered on his face.

Luo Hai watched calmly from the side and slowly shook his head.

He naturally understood why Chi Huo was doing this: nothing more than to pressure Ice Heart Valley into submitting.

Chi Huo also intended to make use of his power, which was why he had earlier spoken of borrowing a tiger’s might.

But Luo Hai didn't care—battles on Chi Lan Star had nothing to do with him; he had come solely for Yang Kai. If Chi Huo wanted to use his reputation as a banner, let him do so.

"I eat the meat; I can't stop Chi Huo from taking the broth. As long as he doesn't probe into my real reasons for seeking Yang Kai, that's fine," he thought.

"Brother Luo Hai, let's go!" Chi Huo called, one hand still holding Wei Feng.

Luo Hai nodded; the two of them instantaneously became streaks of light and vanished, rushing toward Icebound Island ten million li away.

Icebound Island—outer island.

Yang Kai sat in the pavilion loft, meditating and racking his brains over how to meet Su Yan.

He himself could never set foot on the inner island—if he wished to see his beloved again, Su Yan would have to come to the outer island instead.

Yet Yang Kai found that Su Yan had shown no intention of coming—her aura lingered somewhere on the inner island.

Was she at a critical point in cultivation and therefore unable to move? Yang Kai could not fathom it; if she weren't at a critical moment she would have come to see him.

Yang Kai could not imagine that Su Yan was not in a critical stage at all, but had been placed under house arrest by Ran Yunting.

Still, now that he was on Icebound Island and knew Su Yan was only a few hundred li away, Yang Kai was not anxious.

There would be a time for reunion.

After the last time their mental communication had been disrupted, Yang Kai dared not rashly attempt mind contact again. As a guest and with Su Yan on the inner island, a sudden move might cost him more than it gained.

So he waited patiently for the right opportunity.

The next day, as Yang Kai was meditating, he suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp gleam flashing within them. In a clear voice he called out, “I wonder which Senior has graced me with their presence—this junior apologizes for failing to welcome you.”

A soft voice from outside replied, "I am the Valley Lord of Ice Heart Valley."

Yang Kai's eyes showed surprise; he had expected high-ranking figures from Ice Heart Valley to visit in these days, but he had not expected the Valley Lord herself to come.

Bing Long, Valley Lord of Ice Heart Valley—Yang Kai had heard Qing Ya mention her. She was the foremost expert under Grand Elder Luo Li and the one most likely to ascend to the Void King Realm.

Ice Heart Valley regarded him so highly?

Yang Kai waved his hand, opened the main door, and rose solemnly to greet them.

Two women entered—both middle-aged beauties. The one in front wore a gentle smile and an air of dignity; every movement showed a matriarchal bearing.

The woman following had a cold expression; upon first glance at Yang Kai there was a palpable hostility.

Yang Kai frowned, at a loss to understand why this woman bore him ill will.

Bing Long advanced gracefully and stopped three zhang in front of Yang Kai. She sized him up and gently asked, "Are you Yang Kai?"

"This one is Yang Kai. Greetings, Senior Bing Long!" Yang Kai cupped his fists.

Bing Long nodded slightly. "Truly a dragon among men—your aura is deep. No wonder you were able to kill Jiang Xi and Yan Chilei. For what happened last time, I thank you on behalf of Junior Sister Yu for your righteous intervention."

Yang Kai waved his hand and replied, "I only acted in self-defense, Valley Lord, you are too polite."

After that he eyed the woman behind Bing Long with suspicion and asked, "And this is..."

"This is my Ice Heart Valley Great Elder!" Bing Long introduced.

Yang Kai's brow rose—only then did he realize the woman behind Bing Long was Su Yan's master!

From her aura, it was clear she had been the one to interfere with his mental communication with Su Yan yesterday.

Yet this woman seemed full of prejudice and hostility toward him—did she know something? Yang Kai frowned inwardly.

Thinking this, Yang Kai cupped his fists once more and said, “So it is the Great Elder—this junior has been discourteous!”

Ran Yunting snorted coldly and showed no intention of acknowledging Yang Kai.

Bing Long's eyes flashed with surprise—unsure of the Great Elder's purpose, she quickly smoothed things over, "We came uninvited; please, Young Brother, do not take offense."

"The Valley Lord flatters me. This is Icebound Island—this one is but a guest. It was my failing for not coming to greet you." Yang Kai replied.

Bing Long's eyes showed a trace of approval. She found Yang Kai not only had solid cultivation but also a humble demeanor—quite unlike many of the younger generation who were arrogant and presumptuous, flaunting their genius with no respect for elders.

Bing Long's first impression of Yang Kai was favorable.

Bing Long and Ran Yunting were seated, and Ice Heart Valley's female disciples served them tea.

Yang Kai did not know why they had come and did not speak rashly; he sipped his tea and sat in quiet restraint.

Ran Yunting, once seated, kept her gaze fixed on Yang Kai as if trying to read him to the marrow; her stare was piercing.

Fortunately Bing Long was tactful, asking Yang Kai a few inconsequential questions that eased the atmosphere considerably.

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Bing Long suddenly asked, "Young brother Yang, you are not a martial artist from Chi Lan Star, are you?"

Yang Kai knew she was probing for information and did not hide it—he nodded, "No, I'm not from Chi Lan Star."

"Then where do you come from?" she asked.

"My homeland is the Tongxuan Continent!" Yang Kai replied.

Bing Long's brow furrowed—she had apparently never heard of it.

Ran Yunting's phoenix-like eyes narrowed; a glint flashed within them.

Bing Long had not heard of the Tongxuan Continent, but Ran Yunting had.

Su Yan, it turned out, came from the Tongxuan Continent!

So this brat really was the bastard who ruined Su Yan’s purity and hindered her from reaching the pinnacle of the Martial Dao!

A faint killing intent slipped out—extremely subtle, but Bing Long sensed it and glanced at Ran Yunting with suspicion. Seeing Yang Kai showing no sign of noticing, she smiled slightly and said, "It seems I'm ignorant; this continent is one I have never heard of."

“To be honest with Senior, my homeland is a barren place—insignificant within the vast Star Domain. It’s only natural that you’ve never heard of it.”
