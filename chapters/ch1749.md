## Chapter 1749 — Lost Realm

"Elder Luo, why did you come in person?"

After inviting Luo Lan into the palace and settling her in the receiving hall, Yang Kai finally spoke.

"Young Brother is the Young Master's friend, so I naturally came myself," Luo Lan smiled, "what, am I not welcome?"

"How could that be? Your arrival truly brings luster to my humble abode," Yang Kai laughed awkwardly.

As the saying went, one does not visit the Three Treasures Hall without a purpose. He certainly didn’t believe someone like Luo Lan would come all this way just to enjoy the scenery. As for the reason she had given—well, that was hardly a reason at all!

He only had a materials deal with the Sword Alliance; such a trivial matter could have been handled by any subordinate. There was no reason she had to come in person.

Yang Kai faintly sensed Luo Lan had another purpose in coming, but since she showed no intention of saying more, he let it go and pretended ignorance.

"Your place is very tranquil," Luo Lan said as she turned to look around. The palace, which occupied an area spanning ten li, was inhabited only by Yang Kai and Yue Xi with her two disciples, and Yue Xi and her disciples had been in seclusion cultivating, so throughout the palace only Yang Kai would occasionally walk about.

At ordinary times the palace was indeed utterly silent and secluded.

"Why didn't you have Zhu Liang fetch some servants?" Luo Lan asked, feigning concern.

Yang Kai chuckled, "No need for that. I can handle things myself—what use are servants to me?"

"True, it's better when it's quiet." Luo Lan smiled, then added, "Here are the Ethereal Crystals you need. Although I had people working to collect them, you know Ethereal Crystals are still very scarce. I don't know if this amount will meet your requirements."

While she spoke, Luo Lan produced a Spatial Ring and with a flick sent it floating lightly toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai reached out to catch it, then released his Divine Sense into the ring to probe; his brow tightened almost imperceptibly.

Luo Lan read his expression and exclaimed in surprise, "What? So many Ethereal Crystals and you still think it's insufficient?"

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then nodded. "Not enough."

Luo Lan's expression turned grave. "Why do you need so many Ethereal Crystals? Apart from using them to refine Spatial Rings, there doesn't seem to be any other use, does there?"

Yang Kai let out a short laugh but did not answer.

Recognizing she had pried where she should not have, Luo Lan apologized, "I'm simply curious, you needn't take it to heart. Or—if you prefer, wait a while and I'll send word to the main star to have them gather more for you."

"How long would that take?" Yang Kai asked.

"The main star is not close. Even if they collect it, delivery will take time—at least a year. Besides, I don't know how many Ethereal Crystals they can find over there."

"Then forget it." Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

In a certain sense, the Ethereal Crystals Luo Lan had brought were not few. But for Yang Kai's needs they were insufficient; at most they would be enough to arrange a single Great Space Array, which could not meet his requirements.

If he wanted to connect the Tongxuan Continent with the Dark Star, he would at minimum need two or three Space Arrays in between as transit links.

“Ethereal Crystals are extremely difficult to form. Generally speaking, they appear only as companion minerals alongside certain ore veins, and their quantity is scarce. However,” Luo Lan suddenly shifted to an unrelated topic before lowering her voice mysteriously, “I have heard that within certain spatial rifts, large amounts of Ethereal Crystals are being nurtured… Young Brother, would you be interested in seeking them out yourself?”

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and he chuckled, "So this is why you came personally, isn't it?"

Luo Lan smiled openly and did not deny it. "Since you've seen through me, I have nothing to hide."

"Do you know where such spatial rifts that produce Ethereal Crystals might be?" Yang Kai asked.

"Yes," Luo Lan nodded, "but I don't know if you would want to go."

"What if I said I don't want to go?" Yang Kai replied with a teasing smile.

Luo Lan seemed unsurprised and said lightly, "Well... besides the possible Ethereal Crystals, there's also a Jingkong Beast there!"

Yang Kai's expression turned serious and he let out a low exclamation, then stared intently at Luo Lan and asked in a grave tone, "It seems you know I'm skilled with Spatial Force—did you learn that from Gu Jianxin?"

"If not, then why else would I have come in person?" Luo Lan laughed sweetly. "Since you used Spatial Force in front of the Young Master, it stands to reason I would know. Don't be surprised—rest assured, only you and the Young Master will know about this. No one else need be informed."

"Knowing is fine," Yang Kai shrugged. "If I feared people knowing, I wouldn't have used Spatial Force to kill Li Minghai."

Luo Lan was taken aback for a moment, then forced a bitter smile.

She could not help but feel as if the leverage she had been holding had been shattered by Yang Kai's few words, leaving her powerless.

After a moment of thought she spoke seriously, "Young Brother, since you cultivate Spatial Force and have made achievements in that Domain, you must know the value of a Jingkong Beast's Inner Core to you. This ancient creature that drifted through the void has long been considered extinct, but in the place I know one still survives. If you could obtain its Inner Core, your mastery of Spatial Force would advance significantly. Moreover, there's a great likelihood of many Ethereal Crystals there, which is what you need. If I'm not mistaken, you require Ethereal Crystals also to refine your Spatial Force, correct?"

Yang Kai did not confirm or deny her guess and instead asked, "Where is this place?"

Seeing he finally showed some interest, Luo Lan's expression shifted and she did not answer directly, instead saying, "If I told you that above the Void King Realm there are still higher realms, would you think I was lying?"

"I wouldn't!" Yang Kai shook his head.

Luo Lan was stunned.

"Someone once told me that the Martial Dao has no peak! The Void King Realm naturally wouldn't be the ultimate goal of a martial artist," Yang Kai explained casually.

"I see!" Luo Lan quickly relaxed; she had thought he knew some earth-shattering secret, but it turned out to be his casual belief.

In truth, Yang Kai did know more, but he had not spoken.

Luo Lan continued, "Whether the Void King Realm is the highest realm for martial artists is unclear. But with legendary figures like the Starry Sky Emperor, many Void King experts believe there must be higher realms, and above our Star Domain there are also higher planes."

"Why do you say that?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Because the place I'm speaking of may be a fragment that fell from one of those higher planes," Luo Lan said solemnly. "We call it the Lost Realm. Its laws and the Spiritual Qi there differ from any Cultivation Star within the Star Domain. Yet it conceals countless opportunities: precious cultivation materials, and some have even taken out from there medicines that surpass Void King-Grade. Those medicines alone pushed a person's cultivation forward. Even Void King practitioners find cultivation there easier; with luck one might break through past their bottleneck and reach the next realm."

"The Lost Realm?" Yang Kai's brow rose.

"Yes. Its heavens-and-earth laws are more suitable for martial cultivation."

"So you want me to go there?"

"Yes," Luo Lan nodded.

"Then wouldn't those rare Third Stage Void King experts also go there to attempt breakthroughs?" Yang Kai asked.

"Not necessarily," Luo Lan smiled faintly. "After all, the Lost Realm is merely a fragment separated from a higher plane; it is still part of the Star Domain and cannot satisfy the needs of Third Stage Void King experts for further breakthroughs. Some Third Stage Void Kings who went in found they could not grow much there. Besides, how many Third Stage Void Kings are there in the entire Star Domain? They are all extraordinary old monsters, rarely seen in ordinary times."

"Void King Second Stage practitioners might go, though?"

"That's possible," Luo Lan nodded.

"If it's a place for Void King cultivation and trial, why recruit me? I'm only Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm," Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"You at Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm are not to be measured by ordinary standards," Luo Lan countered. "I've never heard of anyone at your Stage being able to slay Void King experts. And don't blame it on sneak attacks—if Void Kings could be killed so easily, they wouldn't be Void Kings. I sought you because, first, you are strong enough not to be a burden, and second, I have reason to need your help."

"Need my help?" Yang Kai considered, then brightened, "Spatial Force?"

“Exactly!” Luo Lan nodded, wearing the expression of someone who found it effortless to speak with the intelligent. “That Lost Realm is filled with countless spatial rifts—some visible, some invisible, and some that even drift about. They pose a great threat even to those of the Void King Realm. Every time cultivators of that realm venture in to explore, some are inevitably swallowed by those rifts. I have no desire to become one of the casualties this time! Since you are proficient in the Spatial Force, sensing those rifts should be an easy task for you.”

"I understand," Yang Kai nodded. "But... if what you say is true, is there no problem with bringing an Origin Returning practitioner in?"

"What's the problem?" Luo Lan laughed lightly. "Any Void King qualified to enter may bring one person. You will see it's not as if you're the only Origin Returning practitioner there!"

"There will be many?" Yang Kai was surprised.

"Not too many, but since that place suits Void King cultivation, it is naturally suitable for Origin Returning practitioners as well. Some people hope to use it to reach the Void King Realm."

"That's all the intelligence I have. I came to ask for your assistance, Young Brother. Of course, it will also benefit you."

"Benefits come with risks."

"You are young and have already reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; haven't you encountered risks on your path?" Luo Lan laughed. "Cultivation is vying with Heaven, vying with others, vying with oneself—only by striving can one advance!"
