## Chapter 739 — The Ice-Sealed Skeleton

In the ice chamber, Yang Kai and Su Yan’s souls returned; after speaking for a while, Su Yan fell asleep again, sealing off her senses.

Having received Su Yan’s instructions, Yang Kai felt much calmer—this time she had used Ice-Body Locking the Heart to force a direct, minor breakthrough, and she would only awaken once she advanced to Transcendent Second Stage; in other words, the moment she reaches Transcendent Second Stage, Su Yan will spontaneously lift her current state.

That was also the restriction she had imposed when she cast that secret technique.

Knowing the truth, Yang Kai no longer worried or planned to take Su Yan away from the Ice Sect; the environment here suited her cultivation perfectly, and it would do her far more good to remain.

Moreover, Ice Lord Qing Ya and Qian Yue truly treated her well—although Yang Kai found Qian Yue irritating, Su Yan had spoken many good words for her, which made Yang Kai less resentful of the woman.

After circulating his breath for a time, the fatigue on his spirit gradually ebbed.

Sensing two life auras outside the ice chamber, Yang Kai rose and opened the door.

Sure enough, Qing Ya and Qian Yue stood outside; when they saw Yang Kai, complex light flickered in both of the women’s beautiful eyes.

“Su Yan hasn’t woken?” Qian Yue craned in for a glance and asked in surprise.

“She woke for a short while, then slept again,” Yang Kai explained calmly.

Qian Yue glanced at him, frowning slightly; she noticed this brat’s hostility toward her seemed to have diminished considerably and wondered what had caused it.

“You two must have spoken at length, right?” Qing Ya asked softly.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod. “We did.”

“Then what did you decide?”

“Su Yan will remain here. I ask the Sect Lord and elders to take good care of her.”

Qing Ya pursed her lips into a faint smile. “Rest assured. Although Ice Sect does not accept outsiders, for Meng Wuya’s sake I will not treat her poorly.”

“Thank you, Sect Lord!” Yang Kai replied solemnly.

“Mm, I truly did not expect anyone to be able to rouse a disciple who has employed Ice-Body Locking the Heart; you have opened my eyes. It proves the affection between you and that girl is unusually deep,” Qing Ya said, admiration flickering across her pretty face.

Yang Kai smiled and offered no further explanation; while part of it had been his calling, the fundamental reason was Su Yan’s preordained restriction.

Had it not been for her restriction, Yang Kai figured that even if he had been lucky enough to break into her spirit world, he still would not have been able to find her soul.

“I have one more thing to ask you,” Qing Ya said suddenly, her expression turning serious.

“Hm?” Seeing her so earnest, Yang Kai also straightened, nodding. “Speak, Sect Lord.”

“What exactly is the dual-cultivation technique you and Su Yan are practicing?”

“Why do you ask?” Yang Kai could not help but feel puzzled; Ice Sect disciples cultivated ice systems, and their temperament was always reserved and chaste—dual cultivation would seem completely at odds with them. He could not understand why Qing Ya suddenly took an interest.

Even if she knew of such a technique, she probably had no partner to practice it with.

“Don’t be so guarded; I am not trying to pry into your technique, only some matters concern me.” Qing Ya’s brows knit slightly as she pondered, then she slowly said, “Do you know that, long, long ago, there were several top powers on this continent?”

“Oh? What sort of powers?”

“Great hegemonic powers that could cover the heavens with a single hand!” Qing Ya said in a low voice. “Those powers once prospered across the continent; in their era the demon and yao races and other peoples dared not go too far—those were times when humans ruled! The present Demon Domain and Yao Realm were then human territory.”

“There were such powers?” Yang Kai was astonished.

“Yes.” Qing Ya nodded slightly. “Only later, some unknown calamity occurred and those powers were greatly weakened; some even lost their most fundamental inheritances in an instant. When a lineage’s inheritance is severed, it falls into decline. Although many waned, a few nonetheless endured and continue to this day—never fully extinguished.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted. “Ice Sect is one of them?”

Qing Ya showed surprise, then a wry smile, nodding. “Indeed. In former times Ice Sect numbered tens of thousands of disciples and flourished, but after that calamity our predecessors relocated the sect here to live in seclusion, no longer meddling in the world’s affairs.”

Yang Kai was stunned. “What kind of calamity could cause such a great power to fall so suddenly?”

Qing Ya shook her head. “I do not know. Too much time has passed; what I know are only scattered recollections.”

“Sect Lord, why tell me this?” Yang Kai found it odd—these ancient matters seemed unlikely to have anything to do with him.

“Because I remember one of those powers had disciples who improved their strength through dual cultivation! The top experts of that power were called the Dragon Emperor and the Phoenix Empress! When those two joined forces they were nearly invincible, and they controlled the most fundamental inheritance of their power; in battle they would manifest scenes of dragon and phoenix auspiciousness!” Qing Ya said, her gaze burning as she fixed Yang Kai with intent eyes.

Yang Kai’s expression brightened. “You mean to say—”

Qing Ya smiled gently. “I am merely speculating; I do not know for certain. Generally, dual-cultivation techniques are methods that abandon fundamentals for the superficial—practitioners’ roots are unstable and their True Yuan impure, making great achievements unlikely. But you and Su Yan are different; the technique you cultivate is clearly extraordinary, and with today’s anomalous manifestation, I wonder whether that legendary power might be connected to you.”

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai said, his expression odd.

Qing Ya regarded him with a cheerful smile and asked no more. Having said that much, whatever Yang Kai made of it was his business; further questioning would be meddlesome.

“Sect Lord, do you remember what that power was called?”

“I remember—it seems it was called Dragon-Phoenix Palace! It should still endure in some form; if you wished to seek it, it should not be difficult.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, then, thinking, recalled another matter and asked suspiciously, “That can’t be right, Sect Lord. I’ve heard that in ages past the world’s strongest was the Great Demon God of the demon race—how could those sects have dominated then?”

Qing Ya pursed her lips and smiled. “The Great Demon God was a legend of an even earlier age. What I described was the era after the Great Demon God’s disappearance.”

“So that is how it was.” Yang Kai nodded, and some conjectures formed in his mind.

With the Great Demon God gone and the Ancient Demon Clan sealed, the demon race declined; naturally they were no match for humanity.

The continent’s history is long and its legends abundant—stories far beyond what Zhongdu can compare.

“Sect Lord, I will step out for a while; when I return I will take my leave.” Yang Kai informed her and then slithered from the ice chamber.

Watching his retreating figure, Qing Ya slowly shook her head. “I was not driving you away.”

“The sooner you go the better!” Qian Yue snorted, and hurried into the ice chamber to inspect Su Yan’s condition; only when she found her unfazed did she relax.

Within the block of ice, Su Yan’s lips still curled in a blissful smile.

Yang Kai dashed off, following the route they had once played along, sprinting toward the place where the ice mountain had been destroyed.

Half a day later, the collapsed ice mountain finally came into view.

Without releasing Divine Sense, Yang Kai could clearly feel a vigorous energy pulsating outward from beneath the fallen ice mountain.

Pleasure flashing across his face, Yang Kai hurried forward.

After some effort, among the shattered ice he found a translucent ice bead about the size of a longan.

The energy fluctuation was emanating from this ice bead.

Could this be the Cold-Ice Jade Crystal Su Yan had mentioned? Yang Kai pinched it and examined it; the energy contained within was astonishing, clearly extraordinary.

What puzzled him even more was that within the bead a viscous, transparent liquid flowed.

That liquid radiated an extreme, cutting chill; even when Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense in, it felt as if it were being frozen.

He could not help but show surprise—now his Divine Sense was not ordinary but a mutated Divine Sense endowed with Divine Sense Fire, yet even he found it difficult to withstand the cold, which spoke to how ruthless the liquid’s chill truly was.

Not probing further, Yang Kai stored the ice bead in the Black Book Space and prepared to return home, when something in his peripheral vision caught his eye: an unusual block of ice. Fixing his gaze on it, his brow involuntarily tightened.

Inside that block of ice lay a jet-black skeleton.

The skeleton’s meridians were still intact, but there was no flesh—it looked horrifying, gloomy, and chilling to the core.

Could this be an Ice Sect disciple who met with an accident here? Yang Kai thought; with the ice bead inside the mountain, it was plausible the person had sought treasure and been frozen.

What Yang Kai could not quite understand, however, was why the meridians remained while all the flesh had vanished.

He had not meant to concern himself, but after consideration he picked up the ice block enclosing the skeleton, slung it over his shoulder, and flew back to Ice Sect.

In any case, Su Yan would be under Qing Ya and the others’ care in the Ice Sect; if this person truly was an Ice Sect disciple, he ought to be brought back for proper burial.

In the space of a day, Yang Kai had returned to the Ice Sect.

He had scarcely arrived in the Three-Thousand Glacier World when he ran into the Ice Sect elder called Qian Hao.

The man frowned, regarding Yang Kai with a cold eye, and barked in displeasure, “Kid, why are you still in my Ice Sect?”

“I’m leaving right away!” Yang Kai, who did not hold the elder in high regard, shot back coolly, then tossed the ice block he had been carrying toward him and called out, “By the way, this might be one of your Ice Sect disciples who suffered some misfortune outside.”

Qian Hao frowned as he accepted it; after a single glance his face changed drastically and his pupils trembled violently, as if he had seen something unspeakably dreadful, and the ice block enclosing the skeleton slipped from his hands and fell downward.

Boom—

A tremendous sound rang out. Yang Kai stood in midair, frowning as he looked at Qian Hao, wondering why the elder wore an expression of both dread and terror.
