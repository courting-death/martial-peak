## Chapter 411 — Who Will Be the Third to be Eliminated

Observing the expressions of Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu, Yang Kai nodded silently. Even though they had suffered grievous injuries, Blood Servants were still Blood Servants.

Glancing at the others, Yang Kai suddenly chuckled lightly. “Gentlemen, should we become enemies in the future, this young master will show no mercy!”

Zhou Feng responded solemnly, “That is as it should be!”

Yang Kai turned and left with calm composure. Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu solemnly clasped their fists to their brothers and sisters.

This parting might mean that when the Blood Servants met again, swords could be drawn. They might have to compose the next glorious prelude of the Yang Family through their own blood and lives.

All returned the salute with grave respect!

They all understood.

Outside the gate, Feng Sheng still stood there. Only after Yang Kai had walked over a dozen zhang did he suddenly speak, “Young Master Kai, I am truly grateful for your efforts concerning these two useless subordinates of mine.”

Yang Kai waved his hand, saying nothing further. Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu followed, their footsteps leaving bloody seals with every step.

…

All of the Yang Family’s direct descendants had returned to Zhongdu. The family had given them nearly two months to prepare and strategize. After selecting their respective protective Blood Servants, the long-anticipated Yang Family succession battle was finally set to begin.

News of this spread, and Zhongdu surged with excitement. The entire Han dynasty was turbulent and unpredictable. Various forces, both large and small, all marched toward Zhongdu, hoping to gain some benefits from this grand occasion.

Many forces had already arrived in Zhongdu, waiting anxiously and hesitating, unsure of which prince’s camp to join.

During this period, the Yang Family’s direct descendants were busier than ever, all trying to secure alliances with the young masters and young ladies of the other Seven Great Families.

The Eight Great Families of Zhongdu: the Yang Family, Qiu Family, Liu Family, Huo Family, Kang Family, Gao Family, Ye Family, and Meng Family.

Among them, the Kang, Gao, Ye, and Meng Families had already announced alliances with various Yang Family descendants. Only three families had yet to declare their stance.

Liu Qingyao from the Liu Family had made a statement long ago: whoever among the Yang Family's young generation could defeat him, he would ally with them. It was rumored that Yang Wei, the eldest of the Yang Family, had fought him once, though no one knew the outcome.

But since Liu Qingyao had yet to clearly announce any alliance, the result of that battle was evident.

Yang Wei probably lost.

As for the Huo Family, Huo Xingchen, a reckless scion, spent his days indulging in pleasure, drinking and causing trouble. He seemed uninterested in the succession battle, greatly exasperating his father, Huo Zheng.

Huo Zheng wanted to intervene in the battle himself, but his son’s waywardness prevented him. If the elder generation had been allowed participation, Huo Zheng would have rolled up his sleeves and gone personally.

The Yang Family young masters, hearing that Huo Xingchen and Yang Kai had some grievances, had each tried to persuade him, but none succeeded. Instead, he pulled them into pleasure houses for several nights, leaving them dazed and lamenting that one couldn’t fix a broken person.

Qiu Family.

Inside the study, Qiu Shoucheng, head of the Qiu Family, sat upright in his chair. Though appearing to be in his thirties, he was actually over fifty. His delicate and smooth complexion made him look much younger than his years.

Seated beside him were two individuals, a man and a woman.

The woman was the Qiu Family’s eldest young lady, Qiu Yimeng. The man was Qiu Ziru, her half-brother.

With the succession battle about to commence, the Qiu Family naturally needed to choose their side carefully.

However, Shoucheng didn’t know much about the Yang Family’s direct descendants. Though he had been gathering intelligence, it was scant.

The main purpose for the Seven Great Families’ participation was to temper their own heirs. The outcome bore little influence on their foundations, but no one wished to lose, so the matter was taken seriously.

Shoucheng stroked his goatee, pondering for a long while before asking, “Meng’er, what are your thoughts on this succession battle?”

Hearing his inquiry, Qiu Ziru’s expression tightened slightly.

Though the first heir of the Qiu Family, his personal strength and skill paled in comparison to his half-sister. For major family matters, his father preferred to consult her, leaving Ziru to merely observe and learn.

That had always been the case since childhood.

Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly and replied, “From what I have learned, there are eight Yang Family princes participating, excluding the deceased fourth prince Yang Xinwu. By age order, they are Yang Wei, Yang Zhao, Yang Tie, Yang Kang, Yang Shen, Yang Ying, Yang Quan, and Yang Kai.”

Qiu Shoucheng nodded gently without interrupting, signaling her to continue.

“Among them, the second prince Yang Zhao and the fifth prince Yang Kang are brothers, as are the sixth prince Yang Shen and the seventh prince Yang Ying. These two pairs would likely avoid attacking each other until the very end, offering mutual protection. That is the nature of blood relations,” Qiu Yimeng spoke swiftly and precisely. “So far, four of them have allies from the other Seven Great Families. Meng Shanyi from the Meng Family supports the eldest prince Yang Wei, Ye Xinrou from the Ye Family allies with the second prince Yang Zhao, Gao Rangfeng from the Gao Family backs the fifth prince Yang Kang, and Kang Zhan from the Kang Family aligns with the seventh prince Yang Ying. The power of the Seven Great Families is formidable and will largely determine the battle’s outcome.”

“Indeed. The Yang Family is situated in Zhongdu, so they must maintain relations with the Seven Great Families,” Shoucheng said, pleased with his daughter’s thorough reasoning and intelligence, though he could not help but lament that she was a daughter.

Casting a glance at the aggrieved-looking Qiu Ziru seated beside them, Shoucheng sighed quietly.

“So, on the surface, the brothers Yang Zhao and Yang Kang hold the greatest advantage, as each has a powerful ally.”

“And then?” Shoucheng smiled knowingly.

“In fact, that is not the case. Even if these two brothers guard each other, in the succession battle, they will not be invincible. Historically, participants sent by the Seven Great Families are never too strong, usually the younger generation, so as not to disrupt the balance or cause excessive casualties — an unwritten rule. Therefore, except for the Yang Family’s Blood Servants, no one from the Eight Great Families will invest experts beyond the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.”

“This means that the friends these princes have cultivated externally are very important. The more allies they have, the better their chances. Moreover, their mothers usually hail from top families, whose clans will naturally favor their son. With these forces aiding them, they can strive to survive longer and avoid early defeat.”

Shoucheng cast her a proud look and smiled.

“Father, I do not know who will laugh last at the end of the succession battle, but I am certain that the third prince, Yang Tie, will be the first to be eliminated!”

“Why is that?”

“Because he lacks the protection of Blood Servants. In the years he spent training outside, he gained little. His contributions to the Yang Family were insufficient to secure Blood Servant followers. Without Blood Servant guardians and with not particularly high personal strength, his future looks grim. He probably won’t last a day,” Qiu Yimeng said confidently. “The second to be eliminated will certainly be the eighth prince Yang Quan. He has no support from the Seven Great Families, and his mother comes from only a second-rate force. His maternal family cannot offer much assistance.”

“And the third?” Shoucheng smiled.

“I don’t know,” Qiu Yimeng admitted with a wry smile. “Among the rest, the fifth prince Yang Kang, sixth prince Yang Shen, and seventh prince Yang Ying are contenders.”

“Hm?” Shoucheng frowned, puzzled as he looked at his daughter.

Even Qiu Ziru, who had remained silent until now, chuckled lightly and said, “Sister, even I can tell who will be the third eliminated. How come you can't?”

Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly, turning to him. “What is your reasoning, younger brother?”

“I wouldn’t dare call it high wisdom,” Qiu Ziru smiled lightly, “but it’s obvious.”

“Go ahead, Ziru,” Shoucheng said calmly, nodding at his son.

“All right!” Ziru glanced at his sister and said, “The third eliminated will undoubtedly be the youngest prince, Yang Kai!”

“Why so?” Qiu Yimeng smiled lightly, seemingly unsurprised by his deduction.

“As Sister mentioned, Yang Kai has no brothers guarding him, nor any aid from the Seven Great Families. Even if his maternal family offers some help, it is at most first-rate forces, which is negligible. Also, he’s the youngest, apparently my age, and certainly lacks skills. So, he will be the third eliminated!”

Ziru’s words were resolute and convincing, as if he had already foreseen Yang Kai’s fate.

Qiu Yimeng only smiled without refuting, looking at their father and asking, “Father, do you share these thoughts?”

Shoucheng pondered briefly before nodding slightly. “Indeed. I agree with your brother. His two points are sound arguments. According to my intelligence, since returning to Zhongdu, Yang Kai seems not to have contacted the other families’ heirs, nor made any attempts to form alliances. I think he lacks confidence and has likely given up on the succession battle!”

Qiu Yimeng shook her head firmly. “Father, I do not agree. On the contrary, I intend to make the Qiu Family an ally of his!”

Qiu Ziru looked at her as if she were mad, muttering, “Sister, have you lost your mind? How can you say such things?”

Shoucheng frowned. “Meng’er, I know you have visited with Yang Kai before. Lü Liang has already sent me detailed reports about his actions in the Lü Family. I am not optimistic about him. If you want the Qiu Family to support him, you must give me a convincing reason. Otherwise, I won’t consent. While the battle’s outcome won’t affect the Qiu Family’s roots, there will still be some losses.”
