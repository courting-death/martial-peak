## Chapter 2338 — Spirit Puppet

Liu Yan had merely been swallowed by that strange stone, but after breaking out of the shell she unexpectedly obtained a body of her own.

No matter how one thought about it, this was simply inconceivable.

Didn’t this mean that the strange stone had the same effect as a Life Origin Fruit? How heaven-defying was that?

Liu Yan furrowed her brows slightly and said softly, “I think I understand my situation a little... I can’t say why, but I feel like this body of mine is a puppet’s body.”

“A puppet?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Liu Yan nodded gently. “Yes, there are many formation diagrams and mysterious refining marks inside me. But these marks are completely natural and extremely ancient. They must have been refined by some great expert many years ago.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly, as if he suddenly recalled something, and he exclaimed, “A Spirit-Grade puppet?”

He had previously heard Hua Qingsi mention that the Chiyue Sect’s puppets were divided into several grades. Besides the Earth-Grade and Heaven-Grade puppets he had seen, there was an even higher Spirit-Grade puppet. It was said that Spirit-Grade puppets already possessed their own intelligence, could think independently, and could even grow stronger through cultivation. However, even at its peak, the Chiyue Sect had only a few Spirit-Grade puppets, and as the sect declined, no one knew where those Spirit-Grade puppets had gone.

Yang Kai hadn’t quite believed it before, but now, seeing Liu Yan’s current state, he could only explain it as the work of a Spirit-Grade puppet.

That strange stone was not something naturally formed, but rather an item refined by a master of the Chiyue Sect in some past generation. It should be considered a prototype of a Spirit-Grade puppet. When Liu Yan’s soul fused with it, she shattered the shell and assumed her current form, completing her final transformation.

In other words, it seemed that so-called Spirit-Grade puppets were not born with intelligence, but only formed by fusing a living being’s soul with a puppet’s body through a similar method.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai suddenly saw the light. He became even more convinced that his guess was correct.

No wonder Ye Chong kept staring at Liu Yan when he mentioned that opportunity.

With his extraordinary eyesight, he could naturally see at a glance that Liu Yan had no physical body and was merely an Artifact Spirit in human form. The cave contained a prototype of a Spirit-Grade puppet, which was undoubtedly the best vessel for Liu Yan to inhabit.

In that case, if he hadn’t seen Liu Yan at the time, he might not have mentioned this opportunity at all. It was precisely because he saw Liu Yan that he gave a hint.

Yet he didn’t make it too clear, probably because he was a bit reluctant himself. That strange stone was likely the last prototype of a Spirit-Grade puppet in this world. Perhaps no one would ever be able to refine another in the future. Naturally, he wanted to leave such a treasure for the descendants of the Chiyue Sect.

This guy really did things in a roundabout way, dragging things out. Yang Kai secretly complained in his heart.

But soon, he put that thought aside. In any case, the fact that Liu Yan now had her own body was real. Although this body looked a bit strange, it was undoubtedly much better than her previous transformed form.

Having a body and not having a body are two completely different things.

Liu Yan also seemed to grow more and more delighted, forgetting all the inconveniences her tiny body might bring to her future life. She kept turning her hands over in front of her eyes, examining them again and again, her face full of smiles.

“How is the fusion of your soul and this body? Are there any signs of instability?” Yang Kai asked worriedly again.

After all, this Spirit-Grade puppet’s body was not something Liu Yan was born with. If her soul and body didn’t fuse perfectly, it could lead to very serious consequences. It was just like body possession—the reason it was so difficult and had such a low success rate was because of the compatibility between the invading soul and the body being seized.

For a powerful soul to possess a martial artist, it had to find a body with the highest compatibility. Even then, success was not guaranteed. The slightest mistake would end in total failure.

Hearing this, Liu Yan shook her head and said, “There’s no problem at all. I feel... as if I’ve just been born. This body feels tailor-made for me.”

Wasn’t she just born? Yang Kai had watched her break out of that strange stone with his own eyes, which was equivalent to being reborn. But hearing Liu Yan say this put his mind at ease.

He had been worried that this body and Liu Yan’s soul wouldn’t fuse smoothly, but now it seemed that when the great experts of the Chiyue Sect refined that strange stone, they had perfectly considered these issues and solved them through some special means.

Otherwise, they could have just refined a humanoid puppet and forcibly stuffed a living soul into it.

It was precisely because of the experience of breaking out of the shell that Liu Yan’s soul and her current body could fuse perfectly.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but admire them.

“Hee hee, now I have a childhood too.” Liu Yan’s little face bloomed like a flower.

“Careful you don’t stay this size forever and spend your whole life like this,” Yang Kai teased, pouring a bucket of cold water on her excitement.

Liu Yan’s face instantly darkened. She was stunned for a while, then said freely, “Then I’ll accept it.”

…

After a day of testing, Yang Kai finally witnessed the power of the Spirit-Grade puppet’s body. Now, Liu Yan could actually grow stronger through cultivation, something she could never do before.

Previously, Liu Yan’s transformed body could only devour and fuse fire-attributed heaven-and-earth treasures to increase her strength. The Sun’s True Essence Yang Kai had obtained in his early years had always been used by Liu Yan, and half of its energy had already been consumed.

But now, Liu Yan could actually absorb Spiritual Qi and make it her own.

Not only that, but Liu Yan now possessed the powerful cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm! This meant that as long as she found a suitable cultivation technique, she could cultivate and grow stronger like an ordinary person, and one day even advance to the Emperor Realm!

Now, she was a completely independent individual. The moment she was swallowed by the strange stone, her previous connection with Yang Kai was severed.

Liu Yan had truly been reborn!

Yang Kai was genuinely happy for her. He had originally planned to wait until his strength grew, then seek out a Life Origin Fruit and refine a Life Origin Pill to help Liu Yan reconstruct a physical body. Who could have imagined that fortune would come so swiftly? The Spirit-Grade puppet body had solved this problem perfectly.

Yang Kai gave Liu Yan a Spatial Ring, filled with many Source Crystals, various Healing Pills, cultivation pills, and even a few high-quality Secret Treasures he didn’t need. He even entrusted her with the Extinction Thunder Bead, an Imperial Treasure, since it didn’t require much refining—just infusing it with power was enough to use it, making it perfect for Liu Yan.

This was the first time Liu Yan had her own Spatial Ring and so many things of her own. She was overjoyed, playing with the Spatial Ring nonstop, never getting tired of it.

A day later, the two returned to the Formation Foundation platform.

Yang Kai didn’t plan to continue exploring this secret realm. He had already gained plenty from this trip, so he decided to stop while ahead. He had no enmity with the Chiyue Sect, and this secret realm belonged to them. He couldn’t just take all the treasures inside; that would be too unkind.

Repairing the Formation Foundation platform wasn’t too difficult for Yang Kai. In just two hours, the sword marks on the platform disappeared, and the whole platform looked brand new. Yang Kai took out a few Source Crystals and placed them in the platform’s grooves, then activated his Origin Qi.

After a flash of light, the platform was empty.

Chiyue Sect, the nameless valley.

The previous birdsong and fragrant flowers had all disappeared. The place was now a scene of devastation, with traces of a great battle everywhere. Corpses of martial artists lay scattered across the valley, the ground stained red with blood. The overwhelming stench of blood made one nauseous.

At the Formation Foundation platform, Ye Qinghan’s face was as pale as paper, her delicate body covered in blood. A deep wound that laid bare the bone ran from her shoulder blade down her entire arm, a shocking sight.

Beside her, Hua Qingsi, Chi Yue, Ghost Ancestor, Ai Ou, Gu Cangyun, and others all looked exhausted. Each bore more or less signs of injury, with Hua Qingsi’s being the most severe—she seemed to have internal injuries, her face completely bloodless.

At this moment, the Chiyue Sect was facing the greatest crisis in its history—Vice Sect Master Shi Cangying had betrayed them, joining forces with Tianzhao Palace’s Palace Master Qiu Ze to break through the Chiyue Sect’s Protective Mountain Array and slaughter over a thousand disciples.

Ye Hen led several Elders in a desperate fight against the enemy, but they were outnumbered. Some died, some were wounded. Sect disciples either escaped if they could, or were killed or captured if they couldn’t. In just half a day, a once-prosperous sect had become a living hell, with battle scars and countless graves all over the Chiyue Mountains.

Even Hua Qingsi and the others were caught up in it. Although Hua Qingsi had touched upon Emperor Intent, she was still far inferior to Qiu Ze. After a fierce battle, she barely escaped with her life. With Ye Qinghan’s help, she led Chi Yue and the others to hide in this nameless valley.

This place had become the Chiyue Sect’s last fortress.

Outside the valley, led by Qiu Ze, experts from all the major sects gathered, eyeing the valley like tigers.

“Is this your sect’s forbidden area?” Qiu Ze stood with his hands behind his back outside the valley, looking coldly ahead as he asked the person beside him.

His complexion was no longer as rosy as before. Although he had held an overwhelming advantage in his battle with Hua Qingsi, he had never expected that someone at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm could nearly injure him.

That woman was no ordinary martial artist! She was likely from some top sect, or she wouldn’t have such a strong foundation.

If Qiu Ze feared anyone now, it was undoubtedly Hua Qingsi.

He was afraid of provoking someone he shouldn’t, but given the situation, he had no choice but to eliminate all witnesses. If word got out and the sect behind that woman found out, Tianzhao Palace would be powerless to resist. So he had chased them all the way here, only to be blocked by the many mysterious formations in the valley. After several attempts to break through, he was shocked to find that the formations inside were beyond his ability to crack.

So he could only ask the person beside him.

Shi Cangying put on a flattering smile and bowed, “Reporting to Palace Master Qiu, this is indeed our sect’s forbidden area. Since ancient times, no one but the Sect Master has been allowed to enter.”

“Not even you?” Qiu Ze glanced at Shi Cangying indifferently.

Shi Cangying replied awkwardly, “I’ve never been inside.”
