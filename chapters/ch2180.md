## Chapter 2180 — Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus

Atop the lofty mountain, clouds surged and winds roared, as a wondrous phenomenon unfolded—multicolored rays of light illuminated half the sky in dazzling brilliance.

The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus slowly unfurled its flawless white bud, sending out unique ripples through the world. Its wondrous fragrance filled the air, refreshing the mind and spirit.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged not far from this Spiritual Medicine, his mind clear and tranquil, eyes closed as he rested, like a guardian who would not leave even for a moment.

Three hundred li away, several figures were rapidly approaching while gazing toward the mountain. The heavenly anomaly in their sights left them all shocked, unable to guess what was happening there.

Though these people seemed to come from different factions, at this moment they were all drawn together by the striking phenomenon.

Their strengths varied, ranging from the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

As they flew, one suddenly turned and asked, “Brother Jing, can you tell what’s happening up ahead?”

The one he addressed was none other than Jing Li, whom Yang Kai had previously met outside the Time Temple, a member of the Renwu Sect. Though Jing Li was a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert, he had acted quite humble when questioned by Wuchang. Now, however, he had clearly regained his confidence.

Hearing this, Jing Li pondered for a moment and said, “Such a heavenly phenomenon must mean either a rare treasure has appeared or a Spiritual Medicine has matured… Judging by the fragrance, it’s likely the latter.”

“Oh?” The questioner’s eyes lit up, delighted. “So Brother Jing thinks so too?” He clearly shared the same guess and just wanted confirmation. He continued, “Can you tell what kind of Spiritual Medicine it is?”

“How could I know?” Jing Li rolled his eyes. “There are countless natural Spiritual Medicines. Anything that causes such a commotion is bound to be valuable.”

“Heh heh heh…” Another person nearby suddenly chuckled, licking his lips. “Perhaps our opportunity is about to arrive.”

At these words, everyone’s hearts trembled.

Jing Li said gravely, “Opportunity is at hand. It’ll be up to luck. If this chance falls to me, don’t get jealous, all right? Hahahaha!”

He let out a long laugh, as if the opportunity was already his…

“Pah! You think you deserve such a chance?” came a voice of disdain from the crowd.

“Brother Zhou Huai, you seem to have a problem with me?” Jing Li shot a cold, provocative look at the speaker. He had indeed been cowed by Wuchang’s fearsome reputation, but as a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert, he had his own pride.

“I wouldn’t mind anyone else getting this opportunity—just not you!” Zhou Huai retorted, unwilling to back down. Clearly, there was some grudge between the two.

Jing Li’s face darkened, about to retort, when someone suddenly shouted, “Look, someone’s already there!”

At this, everyone’s hearts sank. Looking up, they saw a figure sitting cross-legged at the mountain’s peak. Not far behind him, a white flower bud glowed with misty light, exuding a mysterious aura.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

No one dared hesitate. They all sped up and, in the blink of an eye, arrived not far from the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, their eyes filled with greed as they stared at the Spiritual Medicine.

Amidst the rush, Jing Li glanced at Yang Kai, finding him vaguely familiar. But after sensing his cultivation, he curled his lip and muttered, “Just a First Stage Dao Origin trash… So that’s who it is.”

With that, he lost interest in Yang Kai.

The others felt much the same.

Realizing someone had arrived before them, they were initially anxious, but seeing Yang Kai’s low cultivation, they relaxed.

After arriving, they looked past Yang Kai, their eyes shining with excitement as they examined the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus.

Though they didn’t know what kind of Spiritual Medicine it was, the fact that such a phenomenon had appeared before it even matured proved its extraordinary value.

“Brother Pang Hai, if I recall, aren’t you an alchemist?” Jing Li suddenly turned to a fat man in the group.

The fat man smiled and said, “Pang is indeed somewhat versed in alchemy, but my skills are humble—only Void King-Grade, nothing special!”

Though he said this, his face was full of pride, as if it was something to boast about.

He had reason to be proud.

Alchemists were rare, and high-level ones even rarer. To reach Void King-Grade while also being a martial artist was quite an achievement.

Most alchemists focused on alchemy and neglected cultivation, so their strength was usually low.

Typically, Void King-Grade alchemists were at the Origin Returning Realm, and few reached the Void King Realm.

But Pang Hai was a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert!

He had made achievements in both the Martial Dao and the Alchemy Dao, surpassing most martial artists and alchemists, so his pride was natural.

“Void King-Grade…” Jing Li, who knew the value of such a title, couldn’t help but exclaim in genuine admiration. His face lit up with respect as he said, “Brother Pang Hai, you truly are remarkable. Jing is sincerely impressed!”

The others, though silent, were equally shocked.

Pang Hai clearly enjoyed the praise, his chubby face beaming as he waved his hand modestly. “Not at all, Brother Jing. If not for alchemy distracting me, I’d have reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm by now!”

He meant that his talent in the Martial Dao was no less than others, but alchemy had divided his focus. Otherwise, he might have rivaled Xia Sheng, Wuchang, and the like!

“Brother Pang Hai, since you’re a Void King-Grade alchemist, do you recognize this Spiritual Medicine?” Jing Li asked.

The others also looked to Pang Hai, awaiting his answer.

Pang Hai’s expression grew serious as he gazed at the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, pondering for a long time before finally saying, “If I’m not mistaken, this should be the legendary…”

He deliberately paused here, keeping everyone in suspense.

Yang Kai also opened his eyes curiously, wanting to hear the expert’s opinion.

Pang Hai declared confidently, “Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus!”

“Pfft…” Yang Kai couldn’t help but almost burst out laughing.

Pang Hai immediately glared at him viciously.

But Jing Li and the others’ eyes lit up as they exclaimed, “This is the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus? The one said to clear the Sea of Consciousness, purify the soul, and greatly enhance Divine Sense?”

Jing Li had clearly heard of the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus’s fame, and his eyes sparkled with excitement.

The others reacted much the same, barely able to hide their greed.

“That’s right!” Pang Hai nodded heavily. “This is definitely the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus!”

“I trust Brother Pang Hai!” Jing Li gulped.

“It’s not that I don’t trust Brother Pang Hai, but judging by that kid’s expression, he seems to know something…” Zhou Huai mused, looking at Yang Kai. “And he was the first to arrive. Why not ask him?”

Without waiting for agreement, he barked at Yang Kai, “Hey kid, Zhou has a question for you. If you know the answer, you’d better speak up, or else… hmph!”

His face was full of malice and threat.

“Go ahead,” Yang Kai replied indifferently, nodding at him.

“How long have you been here?” Zhou Huai asked.

“About an hour,” Yang Kai answered.

“So this phenomenon has been here for an hour?” Zhou Huai’s face changed as he looked around warily, muttering, “Then why hasn’t anyone else come?”

Though puzzled, he didn’t dwell on it, assuming others were too far away or still on their way. He continued, “Brother Pang Hai said this is the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus, but you didn’t seem convinced. Do you know what kind of Spiritual Medicine it is?”

“I don’t know!” Yang Kai shook his head vigorously.

“Then why act like that? Ridiculous!” Pang Hai snorted, mocking him.

Yang Kai shook his head and said, “I may not know what it is, but I know it’s definitely not the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus!”

He grew serious and explained, “The Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus grows in extremely cold places, blooms with seven petals, has deep roots and a long stem, and its fragrance is enchanting. None of that matches this Spiritual Medicine. Most importantly…” His tone dropped, a wicked smile appearing. “When the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus blooms, no one can approach within a hundred li. Its scent is enough to affect even Emperor Realm experts’ Divine Sense, trapping them in inescapable illusions until they perish if not rescued!”

He spread his hands. “None of you are affected or hallucinating, so how could this be the Mystic Frost Sacred Lotus?”

Everyone was dumbfounded by his words, while Pang Hai’s face turned red with embarrassment…

In truth, Pang Hai hadn’t recognized the Spiritual Medicine either. He just guessed, thinking no one else would know and he could seize the initiative.

That way, he could make up whatever suited him for the next steps.

But in the blink of an eye, Yang Kai exposed him, and with such certainty that Pang Hai was left speechless and furious!

“This friend… makes a lot of sense!” Zhou Huai’s eyes lit up as he turned to Pang Hai. “Brother Pang Hai, what do you think?”

"I ought to curse your ancestors for eighteen generations; that's what I think…" Pang Hai fumed inwardly, unleashing a torrent of silent profanity.
