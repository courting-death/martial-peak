## Chapter 2354 — Compensation

“You are truly ruthless and merciless. I wonder what my Jubao Tower has done to offend you!” The Shopkeeper of Jubao Tower glared coldly, fear flickering in his eyes at Yang Kai’s brutality, gritting his teeth as he spoke in a low voice.

This young man had killed four Dao Origin Realm cultivators from Jubao Tower as soon as he arrived and had crippled the burly bald man’s cultivation. His actions were decisive and cruel; there was no way today’s matter would end peacefully. Yet, although Yang Kai was powerful, the Shopkeeper was not entirely afraid. As the saying goes, a dragon from outside cannot suppress a local snake. In Gao City, everyone had to give Jubao Tower some respect.

“You haven’t offended me, but you’ve offended my Junior Sister.” Yang Kai looked coldly at the Shopkeeper, the corner of his mouth lifting as he continued, “Don’t claim you know nothing about this. Hand over the item, or you’ll end up just like him!” As he spoke, Yang Kai pointed at the bald man.

The Shopkeeper’s expression changed. He had planned to stall Yang Kai for a while, hoping to delay until reinforcements arrived. Once they did, everything Yang Kai did in Jubao Tower could be repaid a hundredfold. But Yang Kai gave him no chance at all; from his words, it was clear he wouldn’t allow even a moment to catch his breath.

“Do you know what kind of place Jubao Tower is, and who stands behind us? How dare you shout and act so wildly here?” The Shopkeeper had lived many years and reached the peak of the Dao Origin Realm. Naturally, he wouldn’t be intimidated by a few words from Yang Kai.

“It seems you’ve made your choice. In that case, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Yang Kai snorted coldly. The Shopkeeper’s intentions were obvious, but Yang Kai was fearless and had no patience for further talk. With that, his figure flickered and he appeared right in front of the old man, activating the Spatial Law. Within a radius of over ten zhang, space instantly became as solid as iron, completely frozen.

The Shopkeeper was terrified, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. With his strength and perception, he hadn’t even seen how Yang Kai moved in front of him. Realizing he’d kicked an iron plate, and feeling the space around him solidify, he panicked. While desperately channeling Origin Qi to retreat, he shouted, “Jubao Tower is the property of the City Lord! If you dare act recklessly here, don’t think you’ll leave Gao City alive!”

At this point, he had no time for tricks and revealed his backing directly, hoping Yang Kai would hesitate. After all, in Gao City, the City Lord was the most powerful, the only Emperor Realm expert.

But to his surprise, Yang Kai was completely unmoved. The old man saw no emotion in his eyes, as if he had expected this all along.

This brat is insane! The old man was horrified. Knowing his backing was the City Lord, Yang Kai still dared to act so brazenly. Wasn’t that proof he didn’t fear the City Lord at all? How laughable that he thought to use the City Lord to suppress him, only for it to backfire.

The surrounding space was bound, and even someone as strong as the old man couldn’t move freely. He felt his meridians blocked and his Origin Qi unable to flow smoothly. In desperation, he bit his tongue, spat out a mouthful of Essence-Blood, and summoned a large, golden pair of scissors, slashing at Yang Kai.

The golden scissors were of high grade, radiating the energy of a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure. They also possessed some mysterious power; as soon as they appeared, they sliced a crack through the frozen space.

The pressure on the old man eased, and his Origin Qi finally flowed smoothly through his meridians.

But before he could act further, a faint golden light blossomed before his eyes.

Instinctively, he looked up at Yang Kai, only to see a dazzling golden light in Yang Kai’s left eye. The pupil had become a majestic vertical slit, exuding a soul-shaking power. Meeting that eye, the old man felt a sudden panic and unease.

In the next instant, a lotus bud, about to bloom, shot out from the golden vertical pupil and vanished in a flash.

The old man stood frozen, as if struck by lightning. His vision was filled with nothing but that lotus bud, as if the world had shrunk to just that flower. Under his gaze, the pure white lotus bud rapidly bloomed.

As the lotus blossomed, his Divine Sense power rapidly faded, and his mind was wracked with pain like ten thousand ants gnawing at him.

A soul secret technique! The old man was jolted awake, wanting to resist but utterly powerless. The young man’s Divine Sense was far stronger than his own, and this mysterious lotus technique devoured his soul power in an instant, leaving him completely drained and terrified.

A wave of intense pain snapped him back to reality. Looking down, he saw his arm had been severed, blood spraying from the wound onto the floor.

The young man’s expression was cold as he lightly pressed a palm to the old man’s chest.

Recalling what had happened to the bald man earlier and Yang Kai’s previous words, the old man now understood exactly what Yang Kai intended.

He really was going to cripple his cultivation!

The old man trembled violently, shouting with all his strength, “No, let’s talk! I can agree to any demand!”

Bang…

Yang Kai’s palm still landed. The old man’s chest caved in an inch, blood spurted from his mouth, and he was sent flying back to the counter, crashing heavily to the ground. With that single palm, Yang Kai destroyed his Dantian, shattered his meridians, and stripped him of all cultivation, just like the bald man before.

“You didn’t appreciate the chance to talk before, so now there’s nothing left to say.” Yang Kai didn’t even glance at the old man, simply reached out and grabbed the Spatial Ring from the severed arm, tossing it to Liu Qianyun. “See if your belongings are inside.”

Liu Qianyun instinctively caught it, but was still in shock, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief. She couldn’t comprehend how, after just a few years apart, Yang Kai had become so powerful.

It was one thing for him to instantly kill four First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators, but the bald man and the Shopkeeper were not ordinary Dao Origin Realm experts. Yet, in front of Yang Kai, they were as helpless as children, unable to fight back, their cultivation crippled in a single exchange.

She remembered how they were forced to join Biyu Sect, surviving only under Bian Yuqing’s protection. Liu Qianyun could hardly believe this was the same person.

“Senior Brother… you’ve advanced to the Emperor Realm?” Liu Qianyun asked dazedly.

“Not yet.” Yang Kai replied with a faint smile.

Liu Qianyun was even more shocked. If he was this fierce without advancing to the Emperor Realm, what would he be like after?

In the Great Wilderness Star Domain, she was a dominant figure and a genius rarely seen in a thousand years. But compared to Yang Kai now, she realized her own cultivation aptitude was embarrassingly poor.

“Is your stuff inside?” Yang Kai asked again.

Liu Qianyun hurriedly checked, and soon took out a jade box from the Spatial Ring, smiling, “It’s still here.”

This jade box was the one she had used to store the Spiritual Medicine earlier. Her own restriction was still intact on the box, showing the Shopkeeper hadn’t even had time to open it after obtaining it.

"Keep the ring too; consider it compensation from the Shopkeeper." Yang Kai smiled mockingly, "The Shopkeeper isn’t a stingy person."

The Shopkeeper, lying weakly by the counter, nearly fainted from anger at these words.

There were plenty of valuable items in his ring: heaven-and-earth treasures acquired by Jubao Tower, treasures prepared for sale, and some things not meant for public display. The value of his Spatial Ring was immeasurable.

Now, with just a word, Yang Kai was taking his ring. The Shopkeeper felt his heart bleeding, but the situation was beyond his control. Even if he wanted to resist, he no longer had the strength.

“Isn’t this… wrong?” Liu Qianyun had never done such a thing before and felt her morals and bottom line challenged.

“There’s nothing wrong with it.” Yang Kai snorted, “Who knows how much of this was stolen by them? If they’re allowed to rob others, why can’t they be robbed?”

“Well… alright then.” Liu Qianyun happily put away the Spatial Ring, her burden gone.

Thinking about it, if she hadn’t run into Yang Kai today, she would have been robbed and injured. The people of Jubao Tower had long bullied the weak in Gao City, surely committing many misdeeds. Robbing such people was nothing to feel guilty about—it was like acting on behalf of heaven.

"Brat, you’ve got guts, but you won't live to see tomorrow. The City Lord won’t let you off." The Shopkeeper, now crippled, had nothing left to fear. He glared at Yang Kai with hatred, spat out blood, and sneered, "I’ll eat your flesh piece by piece."

Hearing this, Liu Qianyun’s face changed dramatically. “Senior Brother, let’s go quickly, or it’ll be too late. The City Lord of Gao City is an Emperor Realm expert—we can’t afford to provoke him.”

Yang Kai glanced at the old man with contempt. “If Pang Guang doesn’t mess with me, that’s fine. If he dares, I won’t mind sending him on his way!”

The old man was stunned.

Pang Guang was the City Lord of Gao City, the only Emperor Realm expert. The old man thought Yang Kai would surely fear him, but from his tone, Yang Kai didn’t care about the City Lord at all.

What kind of background did this brat have to speak so arrogantly?

In that moment, the old man felt his great vengeance would never be repaid. In other words, he’d been humiliated and crippled for nothing, doomed to a miserable existence.

Overcome with emotion, the old man spat out another mouthful of blood, his aura growing even weaker.

“Let’s go.” Yang Kai turned to Liu Qianyun with a slight smile and led the way outside. Opening the door, he saw the street on both sides, and even the rooftops opposite, crowded with martial artists, all staring toward Jubao Tower.
