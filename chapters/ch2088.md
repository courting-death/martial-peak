## Chapter 2088 — Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array


Several of the Qin Family's guards survived the disaster; one by one, they looked pale as death.

Yang Kai walked up, sweeping his Divine Sense over each of them to confirm there were no signs of demonic corruption; only then did he relax.

But looking ahead, where the secret chamber had originally been, there now yawned a pit more than a dozen zhang deep, evidently the handiwork of Jiang Cuhe's self-destruction.

"Thank you, Sir, for saving our lives," the guards said, coming to their senses and cupping their fists toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai waved without speaking, then turned to Qin Yu and said, "Miss Qin, come with me to see Lord Duan and tell him what you discovered."

Qin Yu nodded without a word.

Yang Kai reached out, drew her to his side, and sped off with her.

When they had used the secret technique, their Divine Senses had been linked, allowing Yang Kai to view much useful information from Qin Yu's perspective. It was still not as thorough as what she herself had seen, so it was more appropriate for Qin Yu to report to Duan Yuanshan.

Along the way, Yang Kai poured his Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass to confirm Duan Yuanshan's exact location.

Before long, the two of them met the lord of Fenglin City on a section of the city wall.

"Brother Yang, thank you for your trouble!" Duan Yuanshan did not look relaxed; after cupping his hands to Yang Kai he turned his gaze to Qin Yu and asked, "Brother Yang says you found something?"

Qin Yu nodded and said, "Yes, Lord. Thanks to Brother Yang capturing a demon alive earlier, I was able to perform a soul-search. I did find some things."

Duan Yuanshan's eyes brightened and he urgently said, "Tell me!"

Qin Yu immediately recounted, in full, the scenes she had glimpsed within Jiang Cuhe's Sea of Consciousness.

After hearing it, Duan Yuanshan's face turned somewhat pale as he exclaimed, "So there may actually be the remnants of an Ancient Great Demon's corpse in that mine pit?"

Qin Yu shook her head. "I'm not entirely certain about that. The images within Jiang Cuhe's Sea of Consciousness were not coherent; we do not know precisely what was sealed ten thousand zhang underground. But judging from the present situation, it is very likely that a demonic corpse remains."

If there were no remnant demonic corpse, so much Ancient Demonic Qi would not be generated.

Yet that demonic corpse was something even the ancient great powers could not completely refine and eliminate. With the calibre of Fenglin City's cultivators, what could they possibly do?

Now that the seal was broken, if the demonic corpse was not removed, Fenglin City would sooner or later become a living hell. But a demonic corpse of that level—who could move it? Who would dare touch it? Only if one of the Ten Emperors personally came might it be possible.

Thinking of this, Duan Yuanshan felt a surge of dread in his heart and looked at Yang Kai. "Brother Yang, what do you think?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "I did not see anything more!"

His meaning was clear: what Qin Yu had just described was everything he had seen.

"Lord!" Qin Yu suddenly called out, "Perhaps I have a way to at least delay the current crisis."

"Oh?" Duan Yuanshan brightened and eagerly looked at Qin Yu. "What way?"

Although Qin Yu cultivated only to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, Duan Yuanshan, as the lord of Fenglin City and its strongest figure, had some understanding of her background and knew this young woman should not be underestimated; were she not hindered by some innate deficiency, she might well be exceptional.

If she now claimed to have a method, then it might truly be workable.

"Reinforce that seal!" Qin Yu said. "I made a careful inspection earlier—the seal has lasted countless years and it hasn't been rendered useless. The Jiang family's reckless mining has only damaged one corner. If we can mend that damaged corner, the Demonic Qi will stop leaking. Once sealed, the demons and the Demonic Qi outside will be like a tree without roots or water without a source—doomed to be extinguished in time."

"You can repair it?" Duan Yuanshan asked in disbelief.

Qin Yu did not answer at once but said, "We can try."

"How confident are you?"

"Sixty percent!"

Duan Yuanshan fell silent, seeming to hesitate.

"Lord, although I cannot be completely certain I can restore the seal, if we do nothing the damage will only worsen. In a few days more, even greater quantities of Demonic Qi may pour out, and then Fenglin City will be unable to withstand it. So in any case the seal must be repaired!" Qin Yu's bright eyes fixed on Duan Yuanshan, abandoning her delicate image and making even Yang Kai look on in surprise.

"So you say this must be done?" Duan Yuanshan asked sternly.

Qin Yu nodded.

Duan Yuanshan sighed deeply. "Even so, how are we to reach the sealed place safely? How can we resist the countless demons and the corrosion of the Demonic Qi? Although I have the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, I am not confident I can remain exposed within the Demonic Qi for long; if—"

Yang Kai nodded in agreement. "That Demonic Qi has an extremely potent corrosive force. An ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator cannot endure half an hour in it; for your lordship, one hour would be the limit!"

He had earlier gone alone outside the city and experienced the Demonic Qi directly, so he spoke from the deepest understanding.

"Moreover, repairing the formation will require your hand. With your cultivation, entering that Demonic Qi—" Yang Kai tilted his head toward Qin Yu and left the sentence unfinished.

The implication was clear.

A cultivator at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would almost certainly be transformed into one of the demonized crowd the moment they fell into that Demonic Qi, with no hope of escape.

Qin Yu pursed her lips and smiled. "Since I proposed this, I naturally have a countermeasure."

"What method?" Yang Kai and Duan Yuanshan both looked at her with mixed doubt and curiosity.

"Form an array!" Qin Yu said with a smile. "Acting alone will not work, but if we can borrow the power of an array to connect the strength of several Dao Origin Realm experts together, it may yet be possible to move freely within the Demonic Qi."

"Form an array?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

Duan Yuanshan regarded Qin Yu thoughtfully and chuckled, "Great niece, don't keep us in suspense. Tell Uncle Duan what formation it is—if it truly works, I'll be sure to credit you with the primary merit!"

"Uncle Duan..." Yang Kai looked at Duan Yuanshan with a wry expression.

He suddenly realized this city lord was shamelessly lax about rank. By relation he was of the same generation as Qin Chaoyang, Qin Yu's grandfather; calling her 'great niece' and calling himself 'uncle' effectively lowered Yang Kai's own generational standing, and he might have to call Qin Chaoyang 'uncle' next time they met.

That one casual 'great niece' and 'uncle' had quietly shifted his generational footing down a notch.

"Have you ever heard of the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array?" Qin Yu asked with a smile and sparkling eyes.

"The Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array?" Duan Yuanshan frowned and fell into thought.

Suddenly his expression changed drastically and he barked, "Twenty thousand years ago, the secret array of the great Eastern Black Tortoise Sect?"

His face registered utter disbelief, his eyes nearly bulging as if the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array were some astonishing secret.

Yang Kai listened curiously at the side and also looked to Qin Yu, eager to learn the secret.

Qin Yu clasped her hands and laughed. "Uncle Duan truly is well informed. The Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array is indeed the secret formation of the great Eastern Black Tortoise Sect from twenty thousand years ago."

Duan Yuanshan spoke gravely: "It is said the Black Tortoise Sect, by naming itself for the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise, offended the Divine Spirit. In fury the Black Tortoise summoned boundless waves from the eastern sea and struck at the sect's headquarters. After that battle the sect suffered countless casualties. Yet within the sect a rare genius used the Black Tortoise's might to comprehend a great method and formed an array called the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array. A century later, when the Black Tortoise attacked again, the sect used that array and, at great cost, was able to stand toe-to-toe with the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise and, after paying a heavy price, repel it and leave it grievously wounded."

Pausing, Duan Yuanshan inhaled deeply, his face showing awe. "Although this occurred twenty thousand years ago, it is not surprising that a sect which once drew the Divine Spirit's attention would be widely known. It is no wonder I have heard of it."

"Uncle Duan certainly knows a great deal," Qin Yu said, pursing her lips in a coy smile, her face blooming like a flower.

Duan Yuanshan gave a rueful smile. "However much I know, it still cannot match you."

As the two exchanged remarks, Yang Kai listened with his mouth agape.

The Divine Spirit Black Tortoise was on the same level as ancient True Dragons and Heavenly Phoenixes—one of the most powerful beings in the world. Who could oppose it unless a True Dragon or Heavenly Phoenix intervened?

Yet the Black Tortoise Sect, relying on a single array, managed to repel the Black Tortoise, which showed the terrifying power of the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array.

The sect had been unlucky to draw the Divine Spirit's wrath simply because of its name; the founder had not been prudent to name the sect after the Black Tortoise.

"What became of the Black Tortoise Sect?" Yang Kai asked with curiosity.

Duan Yuanshan looked at him oddly and said, "What else could happen when the Divine Spirit paid attention? When the Black Tortoise struck a third time, it brought followers and disciples; even with their great array, how could the sect withstand such an onslaught? They were destroyed."

"That tragic?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"Hmph, they brought it on themselves!" Duan Yuanshan dismissed it. "After that, no sect dared name itself after a Divine Spirit." He turned to Qin Yu and smiled, "Though the sect was destroyed, some disciples supposedly escaped with fragments of the sect's secret techniques, including the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array."

Qin Yu scolded him playfully: "Uncle Duan, why speak in riddles? My Qin Family's ancestors did study under the Black Tortoise Sect; the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array was passed down in our family. But what our ancestors learned was not the entire formation. When the Black Tortoise Sect taught the array to disciples, each was taught only their own segment, so seven people had to combine their parts—each responsible only for their portion."
