## Chapter 1859 — Five Hundred Million

Time had flown; the auction had already been underway for two hours. Nearly every lot brought forward had fetched a very high price, leaving the Tongtian Auction House with its coffers overflowing.

However, all the martial artists taking part were from the main hall and the rooms below the A-Class; the Void King Realm warriors in the five A-Class rooms had all held back their hands, and Yang Kai did not know what they were waiting for.

Even Hua Youmeng had bid twice, winning a Secret Treasure and a rather potent secret technique, and she was happily studying it on the side.

By the time the auction reached this point it was almost drawing to a close, and Yang Kai immediately realized the main event was likely about to begin, so he straightened and prepared himself.

"Next up for auction is a Spiritual Pill — a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill!" Li Nuo announced with a smile from the auction stand.

No sooner had she spoken than an uproar rose through the hall, and everyone looked at Li Nuo in astonishment.

After all, a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill was no ordinary trinket; seeing one at an auction was rare. Martial artists who obtained such pills usually hid them away, either for themselves or for close kin, or privately traded them to experts for vast sums of Saint Crystal. It was very rare for one to be brought to auction like this.

Only auction houses with deep backing could obtain Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills as lots.

Although the Tongtian Auction House was passable within the whole Purple Star city, it was not very famous and had never auctioned truly valuable items before; no one expected it could put a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill up for sale this time, which truly surprised everyone and set them buzzing with anticipation.

In Room A-5, Hua Youmeng also stopped what she was doing and watched the platform with great interest.

Li Nuo smiled sweetly, stepped forward a few paces to the maid, reached out and took a jade bottle from the tray, shook it so a crisp sound came from inside, and pursed her lips as she said, "This jade bottle contains a Void King Pill!"

Boom...

After Li Nuo's words, the whole hall exploded into commotion.

"What, a Void King Pill?"

"A Void King Pill? Miss Li Nuo, you are not deceiving us, are you?"

Li Nuo smiled and replied, "This auction house would not dare deceive you. This Spiritual Pill is without doubt a Void King Pill; everyone, please look."

Saying this, she opened the jade bottle and poured out a plump pill. The moment the pill appeared, the entire hall filled with its aroma. The scent entering their nostrils caused many martial artists to show pleased expressions, as if their own bottlenecks had loosened somewhat.

If merely smelling the pill's fragrance had such an effect, what astonishing results would it produce if swallowed?

It was indeed a Void King Pill!

The Void King Pill was the Spiritual Pill coveted by Origin Returning Realm peak practitioners when breaking through into the Void King Realm; it could increase the success rate of a breakthrough. After taking the pill, comprehension of the Martial Dao became easier, and one could more readily condense one's Domain Field.

Although this kind of pill could not be used to restore or heal, it was a fatal temptation to any martial artist at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

The Void King Pill on offer was Lower-Level Void King-Grade, and had to be refined by a Void King-Grade alchemist; moreover, because the primary material for refining Void King Pills was rare, such pills were uncommon throughout the Star Domain.

Taken together, all these factors meant that each and every Void King Pill was worth a fortune beyond measure.

Li Nuo seemed to have anticipated the reaction below and smiled: "I need not say more about the effect. This Void King Pill's starting price is twenty million Saint Crystals — begin!"

When she finished speaking, the hall fell deathly silent; not a soul dared bid.

Twenty million Saint Crystals was not something ordinary martial artists could easily produce; only those backed by power, families, or sects could possess such wealth.

But Li Nuo was not anxious, for she knew this Void King Pill would not fail to sell; some people were merely not yet in a hurry.

Huff... huff...

In Room A-5, heavy breathing came; Yang Kai glanced over and found Hua Youmeng was completely unsettled, her delicate body trembling, cheeks flushed, fists clenched, her beautiful eyes fixed on the Void King Pill on the platform.

She was also at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; though she had made little progress since her promotion, with a Void King-Grade pill before her, how could she maintain composure? It was not merely a pill; it represented the road to the Void King Realm.

If the pill could be used to ascend to the Void King Realm, then not just twenty million but even two hundred million would be worth it.

So, overcome with excitement, she blurted out, "Twenty million!"

Her voice broke the eerie silence; Li Nuo glanced at Room A-5 and gave a benevolent smile.

"Twenty-five million!" Hua Youmeng had barely finished when a bid rose from a room in the C-Class, instantly raising the price by five million.

This set the martial artists restless; bidding erupted one after another, all the voices coming from the various private rooms.

Within a mere ten breaths, the price had been driven up to eighty million.

Hua Youmeng's pretty face turned white; she faintly realized she would likely be unable to compete for the pill. Eighty million was an unbearable sum for her. Although there were more than thirty land deeds still at the Tongtian Auction House not yet auctioned, even if those deeds were sold off, how many Saint Crystals could they fetch?

The competition for the Void King Pill had only just begun; who knew what the final selling price would be.

Perhaps even throwing all the Saint Crystals from land deed sales into the bidding would be insufficient, and she lacked that kind of resolve.

"One hundred million!" came an elder's voice from a B-Class room; though he feigned calm, anyone could hear the excitement and trepidation in it.

When that price was announced, the hall fell silent again.

A Void King Pill was precious, but it merely increased the chance of success for a breakthrough — it did not guarantee that taking it would bring ascension; it offered only a sliver of hope.

One hundred million was about as high as most martial artists thought reasonable.

So after their initial hot-blooded impulse, many began to cool down and ceased competing.

Long enough passed with no new bids.

Li Nuo showed no worry; standing on the platform she asked with a smile, "An elder from B-8 has bid one hundred million — is there anyone who will top it?"

"No one, hurry and start the countdown!" the martial artist in B-8 shouted anxiously.

He too could not easily produce one hundred million Saint Crystal, but trading for a Void King Pill was still worth it, so he feared more competitors and urged on forcefully.

"Heh heh, one hundred ten million!" At that moment a hearty laugh came from one of the rooms, pushing the price up by ten million.

"Who, which bastard dares to bid against this old man, damn it!" the man in Room B-8 snarled, his nose twisting in anger.

But when he realized the voice had come from Room A-2, his expression changed drastically.

He was only in Room B-8 while the other was in Room A-2; their standing and status were clearly higher than his.

At the same time, from Room A-2 a powerful Divine Sense leisurely probed out and slammed toward the speaking martial artist.

A muffled groan came; the man in Room B-8 went pale, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, and he stared at Room A-2 in terror, whispering, "Void King Realm!"

"Hmph, since you came to the auction you should follow the rules; next time you act so presumptuously I'll take your damn life!" another voice came from Room A-2.

"Yes, yes, sir, your reprimand is deserved," the man in Room B-8 dared not complain, nodding hastily; cold sweat beaded on his forehead. Though the room's barrier prevented seeing the other, he knew a Void King Realm practitioner wasn't someone to provoke.

"Such arrogance—daring to claim you can take lives at will even here in Purple Star City. Do you truly hold the city’s laws in such contempt?"

Suddenly another hoary voice sounded, and everyone was stunned at the sudden tumult; following the sound they saw that the speaker came from Room A-1!

This was the most honored room in the auction hall, and people had been speculating who sat inside; now when the occupant spoke, someone cried out, "Great Elder — it is the Great Elder!"

My heavens, it really was the Great Elder; two years earlier someone had once seen the Great Elder from afar and heard him rebuke others — it was indeed the Great Elder's voice.

Why would the Great Elder be here?

For a moment, people murmured among themselves.

However, if the one seated in Room A-1 is the Great Elder, Gongsun Liang, then there’s nothing puzzling about it. After all, in all of Purple Star, no one holds greater power than the Great Elder.

What puzzled people was the identity of the one in Room A-2; the Great Elder seemed not to favor them much.

"This Void King Pill, I'll take it — two hundred million!" Gongsun Liang said calmly.

A murmur swept through the hall.

The hall once again erupted — not only because Gongsun Liang would bid, but because his price jump was terrifying: he directly raised it from one hundred ten million to two hundred million.

People could not help but marvel inwardly — no wonder he was the Purple Star's Great Elder; his wealth would surely outlast ordinary martial artists for hundreds of lifetimes.

"Two hundred ten million!" Unexpectedly, the bidder from Room A-2 once again followed up.

"Three hundred million!" Gongsun Liang snorted coldly.

"Three hundred ten million!"

"Five hundred million!"

...

Everyone was stunned, eyes wide, straining to hear the bidding voices rising and falling between the two A-Class rooms.

Even Yang Kai furrowed his brow, showing a strange expression.

Although the Void King Pill was worth a fortune, five hundred million Saint Crystal seemed excessive; and given Gongsun Liang's cultivation and position, the pill was of no use to him personally. Even if he wanted to buy it for his descendants, he wouldn't invest so much, would he?

Yang Kai was at a loss.

After Gongsun Liang's five hundred million Saint Crystal bid, the bidding from Room A-2 immediately went silent, seemingly unable to keep pace.
