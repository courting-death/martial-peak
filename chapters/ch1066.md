## Chapter 1066 — Cultivation

In a side chamber of Zong Ao's palace, Yang Kai sat cross-legged.

He took out the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid and, without hesitation, swallowed it whole.

A cool sensation spread from his throat straight down to his abdomen. Silently circulating his cultivation art to dissolve the medicine’s effects, that coolness soon extended throughout his limbs and bones. Every pore of his body opened wide, and each piece of flesh felt as if it were being greatly nourished, rejoicing in delight.

In order to refine a Leaving Flame Pill capable of producing a Pill Cloud, and to rapidly advance his cultivation realm, Yang Kai spared no effort.

Moreover, he did not regard this incident as a calamity; on the contrary, he saw it as an opportunity.

Now that he was wandering alone in the Star Domain with no family, no friends, and no backing, his personal strength was the only foundation for his survival. Xue Yue lay unconscious, which conveniently gave him a chance to devote himself to cultivation.

From another angle, a misfortune can often become a blessing.

He could use these months of secluded, strenuous cultivation to push his strength to a higher tier, and he could also improve his alchemical skills so that they would complement his cultivation Stage, bringing him substantial growth.

The coolness invigorated him; never before had he been this clear-headed.

Suddenly he developed a clear plan and understanding of his future, and his emotions stirred.

Xue Yue’s even breathing came from the adjacent room. The method Zong Ao used earlier could only sustain her life for a year or two at most; if she had not received medicines by then, death would be inevitable.

But Yang Kai was no longer as anxious as at first; instead, his mind was as calm as still water.

The Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid’s effects continued to work. Halika hadn’t fully explained to Yang Kai how such a heavenly treasure could enhance cultivation efficiency, so Yang Kai kept sensing the changes in his own body, eager to discover the truth.

Suddenly the coolness converged toward his chest, and the orchid’s medicinal force concentrated in a short time.

Yang Kai, puzzled, loosened his robe to reveal his strong torso and looked down at his chest.

A golden dragon’s silhouette flashed across—this was a Dragon Emperor legacy.

The golden dragon pattern shifted constantly like a living thing, sometimes moving to the front, sometimes to his back. The Ice Phoenix pattern remained steady on his back and did not stir; it was the Phoenix Empress legacy belonging to Su Yan, and Yang Kai’s body was only its temporary host. Once Yang Kai found Su Yan, it could be handed over to her.

At that moment, a faint black qi gathered at his chest, ghostly and sinister. Yang Kai concentrated to feel it and found nothing amiss; he quietly waited.

Before long, the black qi grew denser and denser, eventually forming a vague pattern.

Yang Kai studied it carefully but could not make it out.

After about half a day, the coolness in his chest suddenly vanished, and the writhing, vague pattern snapped into place and became clear.

It was a baby-faced pattern, its features distinct—like a head had appeared on Yang Kai’s chest, making one’s heart pound with unease and dread.

Yang Kai was stupefied. He never expected the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid to trigger such a phenomenon.

While he was still astonished, the baby’s mouth in that chest pattern suddenly opened and, like a whale inhaling water, began crazily devouring the surrounding Spiritual Qi.

Hiss—

A gale swept the chamber as inconceivable heaven-and-earth energy poured into Yang Kai’s body, sucked in by the baby-pattern’s mouth.

In an instant, Yang Kai felt body and mind refreshingly replenished; his flesh was greatly restored, his meridians writhed and received Heaven-and-Earth Energy, which his cultivation method transformed into powerful capital for himself.

Truly miraculous!

Yang Kai rejoiced, closing his eyes to savor the benefits the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid brought him.

Though the pattern that formed on his chest did not look impressive, its effects were undeniably real.

From then on, even if he did not actively cultivate, under the orchid’s effect he could constantly draw in Spiritual Qi, at a rate and efficiency even greater than when he trained diligently.

The baby pattern inhaled and exhaled once every thirty breaths, actively pulling Spiritual Qi into Yang Kai’s body to make him stronger; each intake was enormous.

Halika’s gift fit Yang Kai’s needs perfectly.

He spent a lot of time on the road, and while traveling he rarely had opportunities to cultivate; if the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid kept working, it would be difficult for his strength not to improve.

From then on, whether rushing along or fighting, he could maintain a state of cultivation.

Unfortunately, according to what Halika had said, the orchid’s effect would diminish over time, at most lasting two or three years before fading.

And such things were extremely rare; when one or two were found they were hotly contested. Halika had once bared his head and blood in fights to seize them.

Two or three years would be enough!

After taking the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid, Yang Kai produced the Snow Pool Crystal Essence and took a little of it into his mouth.

The same coolness melted on his tongue; the Snow Pool Crystal Essence was a product of the Snow Pool and was naturally icy.

Yang Kai’s spirit trembled, and he involuntarily felt a sense of ethereal detachment, as if his soul had been purified.

A subtle, strange force rippled in his mouth and flowed into his belly, absorbed by his body like curling pale smoke rising swiftly to converge within Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

The Sea of Consciousness, which had been stirred by excitement, instantly calmed without a ripple.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense seemed elevated in that instant; his mood became as placid as an ancient well.

The Snow Pool Crystal Essence took effect, and Yang Kai suddenly had an odd feeling of being outside himself, observing his own transformations with a detached gaze.

Memories stored in his Sea of Consciousness and scenes of past experiences flashed through his thoughts like passing scenery.

He reviewed the roads he had walked, the people and events he had encountered, the battles and setbacks, the joys and frustrations—he reexamined them all.

Once more he retraced the decades of his life in a few moments.

He noticed many details he had once overlooked and saw numerous regrets; among those details and regrets his mindset began to subtly shift.

He became more mature and more seasoned.

As his mindset changed, the Sea of Consciousness itself seemed to alter—the water level slowly rose, a sign that Divine Sense power was increasing; the water’s color grew deeper, a trace of the strengthened Divine Sense.

On the Six-Colored Treasure Isle, six-hued radiance shone upon the Sea of Consciousness, more dazzling than before, and even the Soul Devouring Worms living on the isle grew more joyful, voraciously devouring the power produced by the Warm Spirit Lotus.

Quickly their numbers reached a limit; they began attacking nearby companions in unison, devouring weaker bodies and eliminating the weak so that the strong worms became even more formidable.

Yang Kai watched all of this with perfect clarity and did not interfere; he observed calmly.

The Soul Devouring Worms had once been one of his trump cards, capable of threatening Saint Realm cultivators and easily killing Transcendent Realm warriors.

But upon entering the Star Domain, the worms had lost much of their usefulness—Saint-Grade cultivators were ubiquitous within the Star Domain and Saint King Realm fighters emerged in abundance; the worms posed no threat to them.

Yang Kai was curious to see how these ancient insects, which only devoured Divine Sense power, would change after this—whether they might become useful again.

He urgently needed power.

The worms’ battle was ferocious; tiny insects were devoured by their comrades until only elites remained, and those survivors became far more imposing than they had seemed before.

At last the internal conflict on the Six-Colored Treasure Isle drew to an end, and the number of Soul Devouring Worms diminished by a factor of ten thousand.

They all seemed to fall into sleep at once. Scanning them with Divine Sense, Yang Kai discovered each one had cocooned itself like a silkworm, wrapped and emitting only faint traces of life.

Yang Kai no longer paid them much attention and withdrew his Divine Sense.

He went outside the palace and took out the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags, then, following the method the middle-aged woman had given him, poured power into the flags and tossed the seven small banners in all directions.

The little flags suddenly enlarged and arranged themselves around Yang Kai in a strange, orderly pattern, fluttering in the wind.

Subtle connections formed among the seven flags, binding them into an array.

At the slightest disturbance, distant trees swayed and vast quantities of Spiritual Qi were drawn toward the flags as if being pulled; the sky above immediately shifted with winds and clouds.

Yang Kai remained unmoving. He popped a few cultivation Pills into his mouth and held a superb Saint Crystal in his hand.

Inside the palace, Zong Ao, who was arduously refining pills, noticed the commotion outside and paused his movements. He sent out his Divine Sense and soon understood what was happening.

"No justice, no justice…" he muttered, "Why when I was weak did nobody provide me with such generous cultivation conditions? So unfair."

He was truly a little envious.

Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid, Snow Pool Crystal Essence, Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags…

Moreover, his three-thousand-li territory had already been arrayed with many formations to gather Spiritual Qi.

All these effects together raised that youngster’s cultivation speed to an incredible degree.

It was almost comparable to the speed at which an Origin Returning Realm expert devours and concentrates Spiritual Qi while cultivating.

At this rate, in only a few months he would break through his current Stage and step into a higher one.

The only question was whether the boy’s body could withstand it.

Such frenzied accumulation of Spiritual Qi is not something a Saint Realm cultivator can endure; if the intake outpaces digestion and reception, it will burden the body, possibly causing meridians to rupture or damaging the root foundation—then the losses would far outweigh the gains.
