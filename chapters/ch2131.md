## Chapter 2131 — Xia Sheng

When Wen Zishan said this, everyone immediately understood why the mere opening of the Four Seasons Land could alarm Great Emperor Tianshu.

Back when the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was eradicated, Great Emperor Tianshu also took part. It was precisely thanks to his divine abilities that the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s whereabouts were calculated, and his downfall was seen through.

Otherwise, facing the strongest expert in the Star Realm at that time, who would dare act rashly?

That would be nothing short of courting death.

"Lord Tianshu… what did he say?" Gao Xueting asked nervously.

Wen Zishan replied, "It’s not that serious. It’s just that this time Star Seals appeared inside Four Seasons Land, which is puzzling!"

"Star Seals?" Qiu Ran's brows jumped. "The tokens for entering the Shattered Star Sea?"

"Mm."

"But..."

"I know what you’re about to say." Wen Zishan waved his hand. "In past years, before the Shattered Star Sea opens, Star Seals appear at random. None of us expected one to show up inside a secret realm. This is likely a coincidence that happened to overlap with the opening of Four Seasons Land. Since Star Seals are random and we’ve received Lord Tianshu’s message, have the disciples search with all their might. The number of Star Seals we secure will determine our quotas for entering the Shattered Star Sea later—there’s no room for carelessness."

"Hall Master, that does make sense." Qiu Ran thought for a moment and nodded. "In that case, let’s send down the order and have the disciples put in extra effort. By the way, Hall Master, since our Qingyang Shrine received Lord Tianshu’s message, what about the other forces…?"

"Any with a bit of strength will surely receive it as well," Wen Zishan said.

"In that case… to compete for the Star Seals, this year’s Four Seasons Land trial will be several times more dangerous than in previous years." Qiu Ran couldn’t help but look worried.

Wen Zishan smiled and said, "Saplings must weather the wind and rain. If you shelter them too much… they’ll never grow."

"Hall Master is right!" Qiu Ran said respectfully.

"Alright. Since things have changed, let’s set out early. Pass down the order—everyone gathers at dawn tomorrow!" Wen Zishan turned to look at Gao Xueting as he spoke.

"Yes!" Gao Xueting responded.

Wen Zishan grinned again and said, "Elder Gao, don’t forget what you promised me…"

Gao Xueting’s face changed slightly. She gritted her teeth and said, "Must it really be that way?"

Wen Zishan chuckled, "What’s wrong? Thinking of going back on your word? That’s no good… A person without integrity cannot stand."

Gao Xueting said bitterly, "Understood! I won’t let Hall Master down!"

By the end, she was gnashing her teeth, her beautiful eyes filled with a blood-and-tears accusation!

"I’ll be watching!" Wen Zishan laughed heartily, clearly in a good mood, and in the blink of an eye, he was gone.

Everyone looked at Gao Xueting in confusion, not knowing what had happened between her and the Hall Master.

"Sister Gao…" Chen Qian spoke up worriedly.

"No need to say anything. You’ll know tomorrow." Gao Xueting was in a foul mood, her emotions abnormal. Her chest heaved violently, clearly furious, and she didn’t bother to explain.

"Alright… then."

That night, Yang Kai received word to gather at Luoying Peak the next day.

What surprised him was that the one who brought the message was none other than Xiao Baiyi.

Xiao Baiyi coldly delivered the message and left immediately, not even intending to chat.

Yang Kai didn’t care, but he guessed the early gathering was related to what happened during the day.

The next morning, he got up early and headed straight for Luoying Peak.

Before long, he arrived at the plaza atop the peak.

Quite a few people had already gathered here—some from the Dao Origin Realm, some from the Emperor Realm. Qiu Ran and Chen Qian, whom Yang Kai had met before, were among them. When they saw him arrive, they only glanced at him and paid no further attention.

The Dao Origin Realm disciples, however, all looked at Yang Kai with curiosity.

It seemed word of Yang Kai’s battle with Xue Yi had spread, so everyone was interested in this stranger. When they realized he was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, a few couldn’t help but change expression.

Xiao Baiyi also stood among the crowd, not sparing Yang Kai a glance.

Having never met these people, Yang Kai naturally didn’t bother to make a fool of himself, so he found a quiet corner and waited silently.

Since arriving in the Star Realm, this was the first time he’d seen so many disciples from a major sect gathered together. But he considered himself no weaker than others, so he felt no inferiority.

As he waited quietly, he suddenly sensed someone approaching.

He turned to look and saw a young man of ordinary appearance, seemingly in his twenties, smiling at him.

This young man was plain-looking, his attire casual, lacking any particular aura. Such a person would be ignored by anyone in a crowd.

Yet as he walked over, the disciples who had been chatting in groups suddenly fell silent, all turning to look in this direction.

Even several Emperor Realm experts noticed, and the girl named Chen Qian showed a trace of concern.

The young man stopped a short distance from Yang Kai, looked him up and down, and gave a bright, gentle smile. "You’re the outsider who defeated Xue Yi?"

"Yang Kai!" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at him, reporting his name while sweeping his Divine Sense over the man without a trace.

But to Yang Kai’s surprise, he couldn’t sense the man’s cultivation at all. After his Divine Sense swept over, it was as if the man didn’t exist—if not for his eyes, Yang Kai would have thought no one was there.

This guy… is definitely not as ordinary as he looks!

Combining the reactions of the disciples and Emperor Realm experts, Yang Kai speculated inwardly.

The young man smiled slightly. "So it’s Brother Yang. My name is Xia Sheng!"

"Brother Xia, did you seek me for something?" Yang Kai skipped the niceties and cut straight to the point, quietly on guard within.

"Nothing, just wanted to chat." Xia Sheng kept his bright smile. "I heard Xue Yi lost to you, so I’m a bit interested."

Yang Kai raised his brows. "Brother Xia, are you here to avenge your fellow disciple?"

"Haha…" Xia Sheng laughed loudly, waving his hand. "Brother Yang, don’t think that way. I have no such intention. It’s just… Xue Yi may be a bit useless, but for you to defeat him with a lower cultivation, you must have some real skill."

At this, Xia Sheng’s expression suddenly sharpened, his whole demeanor changing—arrogant and confident. "People like you and me are destined to rule this world, to become its overlords. Let those old geezers eat shit!"

Yang Kai’s face darkened, his mouth twitching. He instinctively felt something was off, and sure enough, a furious shout came from the side…

"Outrageous!" Qiu Ran, looking furious, shouted at Xia Sheng, "If you keep spouting nonsense, this Lord will tear your mouth apart!"

"Deputy Hall Master…" Xia Sheng hurried to appease, flustered. "I wasn’t speaking of you… Please don’t be angry!"

Qiu Ran seemed to know this guy’s temperament well, so he didn’t really intend to punish him. He just sighed, "When the upper beam is crooked, the lower beam is slanted!"

No one knew who he meant by the upper beam.

Xia Sheng turned back to Yang Kai with a smile. "Allow me to reintroduce myself—greetings, Brother Yang. My name is Xia Sheng, and I took first place in this round of the Sect’s martial contest."

"I figured." Yang Kai nodded calmly.

He’d met Xiao Baiyi before—the runner‑up in the Sect’s martial contest—but the pressure Xia Sheng gave Yang Kai seemed even greater. Naturally, this man was the champion.

"We’ll probably meet many times in the future, so… let’s all do our best!" Xia Sheng said.

"Good! Hope Brother Xia won’t fall too far behind." Yang Kai grinned mischievously.

Xia Sheng’s smile faded slightly, but quickly returned. He grinned, "Interesting, interesting! Brother Yang, you’re quite the character—much more fun than Xiao Bai."

Not far away, Xiao Baiyi immediately shouted angrily, "Who are you calling Xiao Bai…? Want to duel right now?"

Xia Sheng shrugged helplessly.

Just then, a flash of purple light streaked by.

Wen Zishan appeared before everyone.

He glanced over the crowd and asked in surprise, "The team leader, Elder Gao… has she not come yet?"

Chen Qian stepped forward and replied, "Sister Gao should be here soon."

"Women… always troublesome!" Wen Zishan muttered to himself. After speaking, he suddenly looked up at the sky and laughed, "Here she comes."

For some reason, at that moment, he looked extremely expectant, his eyes shining brightly.

Everyone followed his gaze, and sure enough, a streak of white light shot over at incredible speed.

Soon, the white light landed before the crowd, fading to reveal Gao Xueting’s beautiful figure.

"Elder Gao, all the disciples have assembled. What do you think…" Qiu Ran stepped forward and spoke to Gao Xueting. After all, this time, she was fully in charge of leading the disciples to the entrance of the Four Seasons Land secret realm. But because of some unexpected events, there were still things to explain before departure, especially regarding the Star Seal, which was of utmost importance!

But before Qiu Ran could finish, he stared at Gao Xueting as if he’d seen a ghost in broad daylight, his eyes wide, inwardly wailing, "This woman is definitely not Elder Gao!"

The visual shock was so great, he nearly blurted out, "What kind of monster dares impersonate our sect elder? Reveal your true form at once!"

Fortunately, he swallowed those words at the last moment, but his expression was truly spectacular.
