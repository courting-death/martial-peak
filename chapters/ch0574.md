## Chapter 574 — Encountering Lü Si Again

The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng suddenly exploded, yet the pores covering Yang Kai and Su Yan’s skin involuntarily dilated, drawing in the surrounding mystical energies into their bodies, penetrating their internal organs.

In that mysterious moment, it felt as though an even deeper connection had formed between the two.

This was due to the profound effect of the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, which bridged and linked them together.

Their True Yuan hummed softly. Yang Kai was shocked to find that even without actively practicing any cultivation technique, the True Yuan inside his body was spontaneously spinning at a high speed. Upon closer sensation, he found Su Yan’s True Yuan was doing the same.

Moreover, the speed at which their techniques operated now was far swifter than usual.

If they deliberately cultivated, the speed would accelerate even more. Yang Kai’s mind was as clear as a bright mirror, and his expression grew joyful.

So that was it—the effect of the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng didn’t require ingesting it. Once he and Su Yan had truly achieved heart-to-heart unity, it would take effect by itself.

The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng no longer existed physically; it had transformed into a mysterious force connecting Yang Kai and Su Yan’s minds and bodies.

As long as they weren’t too far apart, even without activating techniques, they could draw Spiritual Qi continuously from the heavens and earth to strengthen themselves. If they practiced, their cultivation efficiency would roughly double.

Add to this the supplementary effect of the Dual Cultivation Technique, and the results were truly terrifying.

“It feels like our child,” Su Yan murmured, touching her chest and feeling the bond born from the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng between her and Yang Kai. Her beautiful eyes shone with tenderness and maternal love.

“Want one?” Yang Kai tilted his head toward her, grinning mischievously.

Su Yan immediately blushed and shot Yang Kai a scolding glance.

Yang Kai licked his lips, his face flush with desire.

Seeing his expression, Su Yan instantly understood what was on his mind. A wave of heat rushed through her body, and she lowered her head slightly, remaining silent.

Yang Kai’s breathing grew heavy. Su Yan’s look stirred a youthful fire within him.

Just as he was about to act on impulse, a sudden burst of intense fighting sounds and shouts echoed nearby, interspersed with strong energy fluctuations from outside the mansion.

Yang Kai’s expression tensed, turning cold.

At this critical moment, being interrupted shattered his good mood entirely.

Su Yan released her Divine Sense, quietly exclaiming, “It seems someone has arrived in War City and is fighting that Enchantress Queen outside.”

“I’ll go see,” Yang Kai said, taking a deep breath as he rose, his face stern, and walked out.

After all, Shan Qingluo was somewhat connected to him; he couldn’t ignore this. Only he didn’t know who was battling her.

Upon stepping outside the mansion, Yang Kai spotted a crowd gathered several hundred zhang away.

There were quite a few—roughly a hundred people—assembled in one area. Almost all were Divine Roaming Realm experts, heads raised watching the sky.

Above, three figures were attacking Shan Qingluo. Each was a Transcendent Realm powerhouse, blocking all her escape routes and brutally assaulting her.

Although the Enchantress Queen had also advanced to the Transcendent Realm, she was still young and had to protect Bilo nearby. How could she possibly stand against three such experts? Despite desperate resistance—covering herself and Bilo with countless strands of web-like attacks—she could not halt their offensive.

“Enchantress, surrender, and we might spare you!” one old man with a wax-yellow complexion shouted furiously.

“Didn’t expect to meet the famous Enchantress Queen here. Truly a fortunate find without effort!” another elder sneered, eager to capture Shan Qingluo alive.

“Don’t kill her. She will be a valuable bargaining chip with the Evil Lord,” the third advised loudly.

“She’s not that easy to kill,” the wax-yellow elder growled in frustration. Though outnumbering her three to one, they found her tactics elusive and had no immediate solution. If not for her need to protect the girl beside her, she could have escaped anytime.

“Lady, please don’t worry about me,” Bilo bit her lip anxiously. She realized she was a liability to Shan Qingluo and could not bear to see her endangered because of herself.

Before Shan Qingluo could answer, Bilo twisted her body and broke free of her protection.

“Bilo!” Shan Qingluo exclaimed in shock, reacting swiftly but failing to stop her.

The wax-yellow eldership’s cold gaze focused on Bilo, who charged toward him. With just a casual palm strike, the little tigress-like Bilo was sent flying, blood spraying.

She was only at the First Stage Divine Roaming Realm, utterly unable to defend against a Transcendent Realm expert’s attack.

In an instant, her internal organs were displaced, Qi and blood surged wildly, her face turned deathly pale, and her consciousness blurred.

Among the hundreds watching, a Divine Roaming Realm adept dashed out to seize Bilo.

Before he could reach her, a figure shot forward like lightning, snatching Bilo away before the man’s move.

The Divine Roaming Realm expert furrowed his brow, sensing the newcomer’s strength was only a Fourth Stage Divine Roaming Realm mastery. He snorted coldly, shouting, “Let go!”

As he spoke, he threw a fierce punch, True Yuan bursting violently, showing no mercy.

Yang Kai frowned, detecting the power hidden in the strike. Without hesitation, he countered with a palm strike of his own.

Their blows met. Yang Kai stood firm as a mountain. The Seventh Stage Divine Roaming Realm opponent cried out in pain, tumbling back into the crowd.

The sudden disruption stunned the spectators, all turning to stare at the unexpected intruder with cold expressions.

Most did not recognize Yang Kai, but since he had rescued Bilo, they naturally assumed he was allied with Shan Qingluo.

“Young Master Yang?” one of the three Transcendent Realm figures attacking Shan Qingluo called out upon seeing him, quickly stepping out of the fray.

Yang Kai turned his head, giving him a faint glance, a bit surprised. “Elder Lü?”

The man was none other than Lü Si, the Transcendent Realm expert of the Lü Family. Both seemed taken aback to meet here.

Lü Si was unaware that Yang Kai had a residence in War City, and Yang Kai did not understand why Lü Si had come here.

As the two exchanged words, the fight involving Shan Qingluo ceased.

The Enchantress Queen watched the trio warily, then moved beside Yang Kai with worry in her eyes. She gazed at Bilo and asked, “How is she?”

“No risk to her life,” Yang Kai replied, shaking his head. Together with Shan Qingluo, he flew back to the mansion and handed Bilo over to Tang Yuxian, who had rushed out to take her inside for treatment.

With that matter settled, Yang Kai turned to scrutinize those who had suddenly arrived in War City.

Those gathered stared at Yang Kai’s mansion with disbelief. They only knew War City had been ravaged, destroyed utterly, yet today they discovered a fully intact residence bustling with countless experts inside.

Lü Si’s expression flickered, as if recalling something, his attitude softening noticeably. The other two Transcendent Realm experts, however, gazed at Yang Kai with agitation mingled with fear.

Qiu Yimeng also stepped forward, surprised to see Lü Si, she asked, “Lü Si, what brings you here?”

“Miss Qiu,” Lü Si nodded slightly in greeting. “I was summoned by the Eight Great Families to rush aid to Zhongdu. Nearby, I sensed a strange phenomenon, so I came to investigate, and unexpectedly encountered an evil lord here.”

His eyes flicked unsettledly between Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo, clearly puzzled by their unusual closeness.

“I see,” Qiu Yimeng nodded softly.

Since the great invasion from Cangyun Evil Land six months ago, the Eight Great Families had twice issued summons across the realm but with few responders.

However, the Lü Family was raised by the Qiu Family. Even if Lü Si was reluctant, he had no choice but to lead the family’s elite to Zhongdu.

“And who are these two?” Qiu Yimeng looked toward the other two Transcendent Realm experts.

Lü Si introduced, “This is Elder Huang Xiao of the Huang Family and Elder Jiang Zhe of the Guangming Mansion. Both are joining me to Zhongdu.”

Qiu Yimeng nodded with mild acknowledgment. Like the Lü Family, the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion had close ties to the Zhongdu Eight Great Families. Likely because of this, they had no choice but to answer the summons despite their reservations.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe greeted Qiu Yimeng cordially but looked at Yang Kai with open disdain and contempt.

During the climax of the Succession War, the Eight Great Families had slandered Yang Kai, accusing him of colluding with demons to rebel in Zhongdu. This rumor had spread nationwide. Now, seeing Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo appear intimately close, they instantly believed the gossip true.

They considered him truly allied with the demons.

“Miss Qiu, what brings you here?” Lü Si asked curiously. Had it not been for the strange phenomena drawing him here, these survivors in War City would have been unknown to him.

“Seeking refuge,” Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly.

“Refuge?” Lü Si was shocked.

“Yes, right here.”

Huang Xiao snorted, “Miss Qiu, what kind of refuge is there here? This place is probably a rear base for Cangyun Evil Land.”

Unperturbed, Qiu Yimeng smiled and asked, “Why do you say that, Elder Huang?”

Huang Xiao pointed at Shan Qingluo and Yang Kai. “One is an evil lord of the Cangyun Evil Land, the other a rebellious young master of the Yang Family who colludes with demons. Miss Qiu, you’re young and naive—don’t be deceived by villains, or you will regret it for life.”

“Deceived by villains?” Qiu Yimeng glanced at Yang Kai with amusement. “Thank you for your concern, Elder Huang. Though less experienced than you, I know exactly what I’m doing.”

Huang Xiao’s face darkened as he shook his head bitterly, believing Qiu Yimeng must have been bewitched by Yang Kai, now unable to see the truth.

This small mansion surviving intact amid chaos was already a miracle. Huang Xiao suspected its preservation was due to a connection between Cangyun Evil Land and Yang Kai; otherwise, with the whole War City destroyed, why would this place remain untouched?
