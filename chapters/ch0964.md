## Chapter 964 — Alliance

Yang Kai's explanation was reasonable, and it matched the suspicions that most present had been pondering over the past month.

They all nodded in agreement.

"I understand!" Yang Kai's expression suddenly straightened, and, appearing ruminative, he said, "I finally know what the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation meant by that remark."

"The Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation?" Changyuan was taken aback and hurriedly asked for details.

Yang Kai hid nothing and briefly recounted the events surrounding the rescue of Meng Wuya.

"When I left, the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation told me that the world had been sealed for too long and should see the light of day again. At the time I thought he meant that strange Small Xuan Realm, but it turns out he was referring to the Tongxuan Continent. He sent me to Demon Capital because he left a memory-imprint here."

The seal's removal, the reopening of the Small Xuan Realm, and the Tongxuan Continent's reappearance in the starry sky — this was precisely what the Great Demon God had meant by 'seeing the light of day again.'

Yang Kai suddenly recalled that Patriarch Chu Lingxiao had once said the current starry sky was somewhat different from before; many stars that could not be seen previously were now visible.

This, too, was caused by the lifting of the Great Demon God's seal. With the seal gone, the heavens cleared, and stars previously hidden could be found.

"So you're saying…" Meng Wuya's expression turned strange; he hesitated before asking, "Is the continent's current state my fault and Yang Kai's?"

Exchanging a look with Yang Kai, everyone else appeared puzzled.

"You are responsible for the lifting of the seal, but the Bone Clan's resurgence isn't necessarily your doing — though the timing is peculiar," Di Mo frowned.

"It could be related. The Great Demon God's seal once covered the continent with his aura, stopping the Bone Clan from awakening. Once the seal was lifted, that aura vanished and the Bone Clan sensed it, daring to rise. This is only my conjecture, but it's very likely true," Yang Kai mused.

The five Demon Race experts exchanged glances, and Changyuan said, “If that’s the case, then in this great calamity of heaven and earth, Saint Lord Yang, the duty of stopping them falls unavoidably upon you. You cannot shirk this responsibility.”

"What do you mean by that?" Meng Wuya glared at Changyuan and sneered, "Do you expect to stay neutral? Yang Kai said the Bone Clan has dozens who have entered the Saint Realm; they can use corpses to make new kin. Given enough time, they'll never be exterminated."

The Bone Clan is like a spark among tinder; though small now, it can set the world ablaze.

Changyuan gave an awkward laugh. "Of course not. The Lord once exhausted himself for the whole continent and perished; we demons are his descendants — we cannot let him be shamed. Yes, my Demon Clan will assist Saint Lord Yang."

Despite his words, everyone could see his reluctance.

Yang Kai cast him a glance, then rose to his feet. “I already understand the course of events and the truth of this continent. As for whether your Demon Race intervenes, that’s for you to decide. If you’d rather see your descendants enslaved by the Bone Clan for all generations to come, then by all means, sit idle.”

With that, he walked straight out of the main hall.

Meng Wuya and the others hurried after him.

Changyuan's expression shifted; he cried out, "Saint Lord Yang, wait!"

"What else is there?" Yang Kai turned his head.

"May I ask, Saint Lord Yang, when you return, will you strike at the Bone Clan?"

Yang Kai pondered briefly. "The Nine Heavens Sacred Land alone cannot do it; the disparity in power is too large. I must find allies — I just don't know how many I can gather."

Changyuan furrowed his brows, sinking into thought for a long while before finally speaking: “I think no one in this world understands the terrors of the Bone Clan better than we do. Just now, I was being overly cautious. Here’s what we’ll do: once Saint Lord Yang returns, gather as much help as you can. I will also immediately muster my forces and lead them to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land to join you.”

Yang Kai snorted, "You want to help?"

Changyuan smiled bitterly. "I simply do not want the Lord to rest in the afterlife disappointed! I am the Demon Lord of this land, ruling the Demon Domain — should I be unable to clean up the mess left by our Lord?"

Yang Kai stared at him intently, then at the four demon generals behind him, noting all four wore solemn expressions.

He inclined his head slightly. "Whatever happens, when this is over, our feud will be erased."

"By then I will have many things to ask of Saint Lord Yang, especially concerning our Lord," Changyuan laughed heartily.

"It's a deal!" Yang Kai nodded. "We shall depart now; no need to see us off."

After Yang Kai and his party left, Changyuan's face turned grave. He said to the four generals, "You know how serious this is; no need for me to say more. Return to your territories, marshal your forces, and in half a month, rendezvous at Barbarian City!"

"Yes!" the four answered and departed swiftly.

On the Star Shuttle, Yang Kai's party sped away.

Meng Wuya remarked in surprise, "Changyuan talked more reasonably this time — he knows how to read the situation."

"He isn't being reasonable; he understands that should we fight the Bone Clan and lose, his Demon Domain could be next. If we win, I'll settle accounts with him later. Either way, he gains nothing," Yang Kai said calmly, as if he had seen through Changyuan's concerns.

At first Changyuan's stance had been ambiguous; he clearly did not want to get involved, for intervening invites loss.

But seeing Yang Kai truly depart, he had no choice but to compromise.

Perhaps he initially hoped Yang Kai would offer something for his help — they had no close ties, and Yang Kai possessed many things he coveted.

The Demon God's Secret Codex, the Demon God's Divine Arts, and the Demon God Golden Blood — each one filled him with envy.

"In any case, this calamity of heaven and earth is my responsibility!" Meng Wuya sighed heavily.

Had he not taken Xia Ningshang into that Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai would not have destroyed those eight Tongxuan Pillars to rescue him. Those pillars were the continent array's nexus; once broken, the great formation failed, the seal was ruined, and today's situation arose.

Meng Wuya was full of blame toward himself.

"No one's to blame," Yang Kai shook his head. "Even without my interference, the array would have ceased operating one day. We only hastened the crisis."

“If it isn’t your responsibility, why so eager to get involved?” Meng Wuya gave a dry laugh.

"Am I eager?" Yang Kai frowned.

Li Rong and Han Fei both nodded.

Di Mo chuckled, "Young Master, you truly are so."

Yang Kai considered and said, "Perhaps I can't bear to see those who just lost their homes lose their shelter again. If it were something else, others would step in when the sky fell, but for those people, I am their sky — if I don't stand, who will?"

Meng Wuya's body trembled as he realized Yang Kai referred to those who came from the Great Han; he nodded slightly. "You've matured a lot."

Li Rong and Han Fei's beautiful eyes gleamed as they regarded Yang Kai, increasingly convinced of their lord's extraordinary heroism.

Under the night sky, the Star Shuttle flickered with pale blue light and streaked like a meteor.

Yang Kai gazed up at the countless stars but could not find the radiant figure that haunted his dreams in that magnificent firmament.

Su Yan's current position in the starry sky was unknown.

A few days later, they returned to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The atmosphere within the Sacred Land felt different — noticeably solemn. As soon as Yang Kai returned, Xu Hui rushed to report, "Saint Lord, news has spread: centered at the Water Divine Hall, within ten thousand li, the land is devastated and none live there. This seems to have spread across the continent and caused an uproar. The Bone Clan is expanding its territory recklessly."

"Let them expand!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "The more they make a scene, the easier it will be for us to deal with them."

After a pause he asked, "When you relayed the news to the major human forces, how did they react?"

Xu Hui said angrily, "Few believed it. Even those who accepted it out of courtesy had no intention of intervening."

"Everyone minds their own business," Yang Kai said lightly. "Of course. But now I think they'll believe it."

"If they don't believe it, there's nothing to be done," Xu Hui grimly laughed. "Countless people have already fled from the Water Divine Hall region. Our Sacred Land lies on the border of human territory; for now, we need not worry."

"Right. Keep contacting people. Tell those willing to fight the Bone Clan to gather at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Tell them this is not merely a human matter — demons and yao will send forces too. This time the continent's strength will unite."

"Demons and yao?" Xu Hui was shaken, realizing the problem was graver than he had thought. He apologized and hurried off.

After a brief stay in the Sacred Land, Yang Kai headed to the Beast Sea Great Forest.

In Thundertree Palace, three Great Lords of the yao had gathered, apparently in discussion. When Yang Kai arrived, all three looked surprised.

Lei Long exclaimed, "Didn't you go to the Demon Domain? Why are you back so soon?"

"I've already been there and met Changyuan."

"How did he respond?"

"He will send troops. I'm here to see where the three of you stand."

"Changyuan will send troops?" The only woman among them cried out in astonishment.

"Let me introduce you. Yang Kai, you probably haven't met Yu'er before, have you?"

The woman called Yu'er was enchanting, her figure lithe, her waist graceful. Her full breasts were high and firm; her skin was white as congealed cream, and her beautiful eyes shone with a captivating radiance.

Among the three Great Yao Lords, one was the Great Lord whose true form was the Ice-Jade Python. In terms of strength, she was in no way inferior to Lei Long or the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox.

After greetings, Yu'er covered her mouth and laughed coquettishly, "I've long heard that Saint Lord Yang is young yet extraordinarily capable. Seeing you today, the reputation is well deserved. You're handsome — would you be interested in visiting my domain for a few days?"

Saying this, her eyes fixed on Yang Kai.

"I'll come by when time allows and pay my respects," Yang Kai grinned.

"That's a promise, then. I'll be waiting," Yu'er said, throwing him a flirtatious wink, her charm irresistible.

Lei Long's face darkened as he protested, "Hey, flirting in front of me — isn't that rather inappropriate?"
