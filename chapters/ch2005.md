## Chapter 2005 — Natural Gravity Field

Yang Kai turned his head and, sure enough, saw six Void King Realm warriors approaching in stately formation.

The one leading them carried himself with a lofty bearing and extraordinary temperament, his face like carved jade — clearly from a respectable background.

Moreover... he was someone Yang Kai knew.

It was Young Palace Lord Ning Yuancheng of Fei Sheng Palace.

That day in the black market, Ning Yuancheng had clashed with Mo Xiaoqi over that snake egg; Yang Kai, concealing his appearance, had put on a show of bravado, using threats to scare off the Fei Sheng Palace group.

Unexpectedly, he now encountered people from Fei Sheng Palace again here on the first layer of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda.

However, Ning Yuancheng did not have the Dao Origin Realm expert Liu Yizhi at his side this time — after all, with the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda opened, Dao Origin Realm practitioners could not enter, so Ning Yuancheng could only bring some Void King Realm cultivators here.

No one knew what method they had used to gather here, yet they had met Yang Kai in the same place.

Though they could be called acquaintances, Yang Kai showed no alarm.

He had hidden his face that day; he believed Ning Yuancheng would not recognize him now.

“Something wrong?” Yang Kai turned his head and asked Ning Yuancheng, looking at him coolly.

“Is that not obvious? If there was nothing, why would we have called you?” a Void King Realm guard behind Ning Yuancheng said coldly.

Yang Kai snorted and gave the speaker a cold once-over.

“Do not be rude.” Ning Yuancheng said in a low voice, as if reprimanding his guard, then looked at Yang Kai, smiled, cupped his fist, and proudly said, “Friend, I am Young Palace Lord Ning Yuancheng of Fei Sheng Palace. May I ask your name?”

“Say what you have to say; no need for pleasantries,” Yang Kai replied, his expression remaining indifferent.

He knew the other's character well enough to know he would not truly be so courteous; he was merely testing because he did not know Yang Kai's background.

Perhaps... it was also related to their encounter in the black market; once bitten by a snake, one fears the rope for ten years.

Yang Kai's reaction and demeanor caused Ning Yuancheng to frown, looking displeased, but after a brief pause he spoke: “Since that is so, I will be frank — that little beast just now seems to have given something to you?”

“So what?” Yang Kai immediately scoffed. He thought to himself it must be that jade slip; Ning Yuancheng likely mistook the jade slip for treasure and grew greedy.

“What is it?” Ning Yuancheng's eyes brightened as he hurriedly asked.

“What's it to you?” Yang Kai shot back.

“You have some nerve!” the guard who had spoken earlier exploded in anger and roared, “The Young Palace Lord is asking; you only need to answer obediently. Who gave you the right to question?”

Ning Yuancheng waved his hand to stop the guard and his expression turned cold; he had little patience to continue parrying with Yang Kai and said, “It is like this — I am quite interested in that little beast of yours; I wonder if you could part with it? I am willing to offer—”

“Not interested.” Yang Kai cut him off and refused before he finished.

Leaving aside that the little beast was a Tenth-Tier demonic beast and not easy to raise, Yang Kai would not casually sell his own, and besides, it belonged to Mo Xiaoqi.

After saying that, he turned and left.

"Friend, it seems you refuse a toast only to drink the forfeit — seize him!" Ning Yuancheng, seeing Yang Kai show him such disrespect, tired of playing polite, tore off his courteous mask and barked the order.

The five Void King Realm cultivators heard this and immediately moved to act.

At that moment, the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat, which had been hovering in midair, suddenly opened its small mouth and let out a string of sharp cries.

Visible sound waves, like ripples, frantically spread forward in a fan-shaped wave toward the Fei Sheng Palace people.

In an instant, the five Void King Realm cultivators and Ning Yuancheng all changed color; their eardrums burned, their Qi and blood churned, and their Origin Qi rolled uncontrollably within them.

They hurriedly circulated their power to resist the piercing cries and suppress the turmoil in their Qi and blood.

When they finally came to, Yang Kai and the little beast were already gone, only their distant backs visible.

“Damn it, chase them — no matter what, seize that little beast! It seems capable of locating heaven-and-earth treasures and could be of great use here!” Ning Yuancheng shouted in fury.

The other five dared not delay and used their body techniques to pursue.

But after a short while, they had already lost all trace of Yang Kai and the little beast.

“Where did they go?” Ning Yuancheng looked around but found nothing.

“Young Palace Lord, we don't know either; it is as if they suddenly vanished,” a guard replied, baffled.

“It must be nearby — search everywhere for it! The thing this Young Master has his eye on isn't going to run off, is it?” Ning Yuancheng said, his face turning cold and ruthless.

The five immediately dispersed to search the surroundings.

Not long after, a guard shouted with excitement, “Young Palace Lord, come look — this looks like the entrance to the Second Layer!”

“What?” Ning Yuancheng was pleased at first, then angrily retorted, “Nonsense! The entrance to the Second Layer is the Five-Colored Pillar of Light that connects heaven and earth; it's obvious. Do you take me for blind? There is no such thing here… huh?”

Ning Yuancheng's words trailed off as he suddenly looked up and indeed saw a Five-Colored Pillar of Light, connecting heaven and earth in that place.

He frowned and stepped back a few paces, and the Five-Colored Pillar of Light disappeared; stepping forward a few paces, the pillar reappeared.

“How strange!” Ning Yuancheng exclaimed.

“Yes, Young Palace Lord — this entrance seems to be discoverable only from specific positions; otherwise, even if it were close at hand, it could not be perceived,” the guard who had found the entrance said excitedly.

“Those Star God Palace fellows are truly crafty. Fortunately this Young Master is blessed with deep fortune and heaven's favor, otherwise how could I find this entrance? Ha ha ha. If that's the case, what are we hesitating for — go to the Second Layer! That fellow must have gone there; I do not believe he can escape my palm!” Ning Yuancheng laughed and ordered.

“Young Palace Lord, that little beast may not only be able to find heaven-and-earth treasures, it might also locate entrances — truly a wondrous beast,” one guard remarked.

“Then this Young Master must obtain it; perhaps it can even find the entrance to the Third Stage, and we can take a look,” Ning Yuancheng said with fervor, then, with his five guards, dove into the Five-Colored Pillar of Light; in the next moment six figures slipped through and vanished.

But by the time they entered the Second Layer, Yang Kai was already gone.

Meanwhile, somewhere in the Second Layer, Yang Kai was walking briskly; the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat led the way ahead.

Yang Kai knew it was searching for Mo Xiaoqi, so he leisurely followed behind it while secretly surveying the Second Layer's conditions.

This place seemed no different from the First Layer: Spiritual Qi was exceedingly thin and unsuitable for cultivation, and the laws were extremely fragmented.

Only, the Second Layer appeared far more dangerous than the First Layer.

In the First Layer, Yang Kai had explored for a long time and had not met very many traps or seals.

But upon entering the Second Layer and releasing his Divine Sense, he could sense numerous concealed fluctuations of power.

Those were clearly man-made or naturally generated sealing forces; once one entered their range they would trigger an attacking mechanism.

With the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat leading, Yang Kai was not too worried about stumbling into danger — the little beast's danger sense was extremely acute and often avoided many traps and seals in advance.

Half a day later, the pair passed through a canyon about a hundred zhang wide, where fierce winds howled through the valley.

Yang Kai checked left and right and confirmed there was no immediate danger.

But then the bat flying above the canyon suddenly let out sharp, frantic squeals, its voice full of panic.

Yang Kai was startled; before he could investigate what had happened, his whole body suddenly plunged downward.

In that instant, a terrifying suction seemed to emanate from beneath his feet, forcing his body downward uncontrollably.

Yang Kai's face changed drastically.

He hurriedly circulated his internal strength, attempting to resist the mysterious pull.

But he soon found it all in vain; even with his Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation he could not steady his body, and the little bat also could not escape — it tumbled from the sky and fell into the canyon.

Wind roared in his ears as they fell faster and faster; the gale lacerated his face like blades, painfully unbearable.

Yang Kai finally panicked.

He immediately understood he had encountered a powerful sealing formation that neither he nor the bat had detected.

Such a formidable formation was unlikely to be man-made; there was a high probability it was natural.

These formations were generally difficult to sense; by the time one discovered them, it was already too late.

Falling at that speed, even if Yang Kai's body were extremely tough and he unleashed the Undying Five Elements Sword and the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, he would still be smashed to pieces.

Such a death would be unbearably tragic.

The little beast's sharp cries kept coming, but because of the speed of the fall they sounded off-key.

Yang Kai opened his eyes but could not make out the scene below, so he had to release his Divine Sense; after a stretch of probing, the situation improved somewhat.

He locked his Divine Sense onto the little beast's position and snapped his fingers, flicking out a Golden Blood Thread, but in that situation he could not maintain accuracy and failed to pull the beast back.

With no other choice, Yang Kai shot dozens of Golden Blood Threads from his ten fingers, weaving them into a large net that finally caught the little beast.

The next moment he held the little beast and, without thinking, slipped into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

A moment later at the bottom of the canyon a light cracking sound came as the Xuan Realm Pearl rolled a few times and then fell still.

Only then did Yang Kai dare to release a little Divine Sense to probe the surrounding situation.

But the suction at that place was too terrifying; even his Divine Sense was somewhat unable to resist, being pulled and distorted and unable to spread far.

He thought for a moment, soothed the little beast into staying within the Xuan Realm Pearl, and then suddenly burst out himself.

The next moment he found his entire body pressed to the ground by a suction so strong that even moving a finger felt extremely difficult.

“Natural gravity field?” Yang Kai's expression shifted repeatedly.
