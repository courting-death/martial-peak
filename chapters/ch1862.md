## Chapter 1862 — Good Idea

Li Nuo held quite a favorable impression of Yang Kai—not only because he had seemed approachable when they first met, but even more because of the message he passed on that night.

Back then, Li Nuo immediately realized that the one secretly transmitting a voice to her was Yang Kai.

So she had long since classified Yang Kai in her heart as one of her own. Now that she saw Yang Kai bid, there was no hesitation; she prepared to settle the price quickly and decisively.

At the same time she was filled with remorse — had she known Yang Kai was interested she need not have put this up for auction, she could have given it to him outright. But even if so, it mattered little; she would return all the Saint Crystals later. She could not let one of her own be cheated.

Thoughts flickered through her mind, and Li Nuo spoke without pause: "Sixty million for the first..."

"Seventy million!" Before Li Nuo could finish, a new price was announced.

Li Nuo looked up in astonishment and saw that the bidder was none other than Great Elder Gongsun Liang; she couldn't help frowning.

In the Room A-5, Yang Kai also raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised, but soon he announced a new price: "One hundred million!"

"Hiss..." The martial artists in the hall were again shaken.

In the past, auctions rarely featured lots that exceeded one hundred million, but today in the Tongtian Auction House the last three lots had all reached that standard, and the Void King Pill had been driven to an astounding one billion.

This unknown forging material had also broken the one hundred million barrier, and that was only the beginning...

For a time everyone's spirits were roused; the duel between two Void King Realm experts, whether a contest of strength or of wealth, was breathtaking — who would miss such a spectacle?

No sooner had Yang Kai's words fallen than Great Elder Gongsun Liang, calm and unruffled, declared, "Two hundred million!"

Everyone stood agape, their hearts convulsing!

Gongsun Liang had only participated in bidding on two lots today, yet each time his way of raising the price was so brazen and ostentatious, as if he paid no heed to his rivals.

This was no longer ordinary bidding; it was the application of wealth to overwhelm others.

At that thought many wore contemplative expressions. No one knew how the gentleman in the Room A-5 had offended the Great Elder, to provoke the Great Elder to deal with him as he would Second Young Master.

"Heh, Great Elder truly has immense wealth — I admire that!" Yang Kai smiled calmly inside the private room. He did not lower his voice, so everyone in the hall heard him loud and clear.

"This friend flatters me. Two hundred million Saint Crystals are nothing worth mentioning. For experts at our level, such things have long since become useless.”

"Great Elder is right," Yang Kai said in a tone of agreement. "If that is so, then..."

Yang Kai's voice paused slightly, causing every warrior in the hall to lean and prick their ears as if to listen more intently.

"Five hundred million!"

At those words the hall boiled over again; everyone widened their eyes and looked around in bewilderment as if they'd heard something unbelievable.

The Great Elder's bids were ruthless, but this man was even more ruthless! What on earth was his background to dare confront the Great Elder so openly — did he not know what it meant to court death?

On the high platform Li Nuo's beautiful eyes were full of unease; she privately regretted having put this final item up for auction. Now the gentleman had provoked the Great Elder into opposition; she did not know how this would end — if handled poorly it could be catastrophic. Worried, she quietly transmitted a message to Chun Yi hidden in the shadows, ordering her to act when the opportunity presented itself.

In the Room A-1 room Great Elder Gongsun Liang's voice drifted out: "Friend, are you sure you want to offer five hundred million?"

Yang Kai chuckled, "What? The Great Elder is willing to spend one billion Saint Crystals on a practically useless Void King Pill; what is wrong if this Lord spends five hundred million on this forging material?"

Gongsun Liang snorted coldly.

Yang Kai's self-address as 'this Lord' had irritated him, and compounded by last time when he sent Jiang Changfeng to invite Yang Kai who had shown no face, his tone chilled: "There's nothing wrong with the price itself, I'm just worried that if you bid so freely you may not be able to pay later."

"No need for the Great Elder to worry," Yang Kai said with a light laugh. "If the Great Elder can afford that one billion Saint Crystals, this Lord can as well."

He meant more than he said, and Gongsun Liang grew even more displeased; without hesitation he said, "Six hundred million!"

"One billion!" Yang Kai did not back down an inch.

In a few words the prices had already caught up with that earlier Void King Pill; not only was it shocking, it was also rather absurd.

In this world, what could be worth one billion? The Void King Pill wasn't worth it, that unknown forging material wasn't worth it — only face was worth that much.

A cold glint flashed in Gongsun Liang's eyes as he prepared to raise the price again, when suddenly from the Room A-2 room came Zi Wuji's light laugh: "Both of you are men of immense wealth, this Wuji is deeply impressed; but Great Elder, you just spent one billion Saint Crystals — do you still have the ability to bid again?"

Zi Wuji felt elated; earlier Gongsun Liang had overshadowed him and he had lost out on the Void King Pill, leaving him miffed. Seeing Yang Kai step up and go head-to-head with Gongsun Liang, how could he remain a bystander? He immediately stood to back Yang Kai.

"The enemy of my enemy is my friend!" Zi Wuji thought clearly, and Yang Kai was exactly the man he wished to win over; he wouldn't let him fight alone — now was the time to curry favor, so he spoke without hesitation.

"Whether this old man can pay is not for Second Young Master to worry about, right?" Gongsun Liang's expression was grim and his tone cold.

Zi Wuji said mildly, “Wuji naturally has no right to meddle in the Great Elder’s personal affairs. However… with Father and Eldest Brother both away from Purple Star, the Great Elder now commands all of Purple Star, and every word and deed of yours affects not only yourself, but the honor and reputation of my entire Purple Star. Earlier, when you bid for that Void King Pill, no one actually saw whether you paid the one billion Saint Crystals. Of course… Wuji has absolute faith in the Great Elder’s character and would never doubt it. But with over a thousand cultivators gathered in this hall, it’s hard to guarantee that some won’t judge a gentleman by the measure of petty men. Right now, there are surely people still wondering whether the Great Elder relied on his status to snatch the Void King Pill by force.”

“Presumptuous!” Jiang Changfeng roared. “Whether the ten billion Saint Crystals were paid earlier—no one knows better than Miss Li Nuo. She personally verified the matter. And yet the Second Young Master brings it up again—what exactly is your intention?”

"Heh, Eighth Elder is right. Then let's assume that the one billion Saint Crystals were paid!" Zi Wuji laughed.

"What do you mean assume!" Jiang Changfeng's face darkened.

“However, some things can be tolerated once, not twice.” Zi Wuji completely ignored Jiang Changfeng’s outburst and went on, “Since the Great Elder speaks and acts on behalf of Purple Star, we cannot allow ourselves to be shrouded in constant suspicion. Otherwise, Purple Star’s reputation would crumble. You stand just beneath one man and above all others—your every word and deed serves as an example for Purple Star. Surely you would not wish for such doubts to linger, Great Elder.”

In the Room A-1 room Gongsun Liang half-closed his eyes and after Zi Wuji finished said indifferently, “Then, Second Young Master, in your view, what must I do to win the public’s trust? Please… enlighten me.”

“Not at all, not at all—Great Elder, you overpraise me,” Zi Wuji said quickly, putting on a humble front. “However… things have already come to this point. If we are to continue bidding, we must at least put something tangible on the table. Heh… how about this: if either side wishes to raise the bid again, then present the corresponding amount of Saint Crystals directly on the stage. That way, we can silence any whispers and keep my Purple Star’s reputation from being tarnished further.”

Zi Wuji’s words were laced with barbs, and Gongsun Liang was already seething. He shot a look at Jiang Changfeng, who immediately understood and barked, “Absurd! Since when does any auction in this world operate like that…?”

“This method isn’t bad.” Yang Kai cut Jiang Changfeng off with a cheerful laugh. At the same time, a sweep of his Divine Sense pressed down, sealing Jiang Changfeng’s voice entirely. “I’ve got no objections. Since we’re bidding, we can’t just shout out numbers at random, can we? I’d hate to be taken for a fat sheep. Young Master Wuji truly has a sharp mind!”

"You flatter me, sir." Zi Wuji was thrilled; as he replied he secretly transmitted to Yang Kai, "Sir, Wuji has six hundred million Saint Crystals here; if you need them, Wuji will certainly help with all his might!"

"No need, Second Young Master — I appreciate the kindness," Yang Kai replied. "I wonder what the Great Elder thinks?"

Gongsun Liang was annoyed, but trapped, and had to say, "Fine, I will agree to your method!"

He was the Great Elder of Purple Star; to compare wealth with him in Purple Star City was simply overestimating oneself.

"Since the two of you have already agreed, then I will be so bold." Li Nuo secretly exhaled; though the auction hall's atmosphere remained grave, at least it no longer bore the signs of coming to blows. She looked toward where Yang Kai was and said, "This gentleman just bid one billion..."

"Hm, I don't have that many Saint Crystals," Yang Kai replied.

"You dare bid without that many Saint Crystals? Ha ha — so that's the reckless bidding you mentioned earlier, huh?" Jiang Changfeng laughed.

"Eighth Elder, he only said he didn't have that many Saint Crystals, not that he couldn't pay. Does that gentleman not have other valuables?" Zi Wuji immediately retorted.

"Second Young Master is right." Yang Kai nodded slightly. "I don't have that many Saint Crystals, but I can use other items in lieu of Saint Crystals. Miss Li Nuo, I wonder if that violates your auction house's rules?"

"No. At the Tongtian Auction House we can accept items of equivalent value," Li Nuo said seriously.

"Very well, then take a look at this." Yang Kai said, casually tossing a jade bottle which, under the control of his Saint Yuan, flew precisely onto the stage.

Countless eyes fixed on the jade bottle, curious what pill it contained that could be worth one billion Saint Crystals.

Li Nuo took it with a puzzled look, opened the lid and glanced inside; the next moment her face changed and she cried out, "This is... a Void King Pill!"
