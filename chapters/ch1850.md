## Chapter 1850 — A Vast Fortune

"Sister, are you sure you want to auction off all these land deeds?" Li Nuo asked; she was a businesswoman, and when business was at hand she didn't think of anything else, quickly slipping into her professional mode as she looked at Hua Youmeng.

"Yes, auction them all." Hua Youmeng nodded. She already had her own plans, but these items existed only because of Yang Kai's presence; since Yang Kai had suggested selling them all, she naturally would not object.

"What a pity, though." Li Nuo sighed softly. "If you had kept them, with your methods, Sister, it would take less than ten years for the Commerce Guild to make a name for itself across north and south."

"You're flattering me, Manager Li; I don't have that ability," Hua Youmeng hurriedly waved her hand.

“There’s no need to be so modest, Sister. Though the Five Directions Commerce Guild may not be well-known now, with this lord’s protection…” She stopped midway, noticing the bitter smile on Hua Youmeng’s lips. Realizing that Yang Kai likely wouldn’t remain with the Commerce Guild for long, she tactfully changed the subject and continued with a polite smile, “Very well then. Since Sister wishes to sell all these land deeds, I certainly have no reason to refuse. I only wish to ask—does Sister intend to sell them separately, or put them all up for auction as a whole?”

Hua Youmeng frowned and fell into thought.

As a merchant, she naturally knew the difference between splitting the deeds and not splitting them.

If sold separately, the deeds would surely be easier to sell — after all, each one was quite valuable on its own, yet many smaller guilds or factions could still afford them. However, doing so would lose the advantage that came from keeping them all together.

But if they were auctioned off as a whole, the combined value of these thirty-some land deeds would be immense—far beyond what most factions could afford. Still, because the deeds were in consecutive sequence, their overall worth would rise considerably.

Each method had its merits and drawbacks; it was impossible to say which was better.

She turned her gaze to Yang Kai, hoping he would give her an opinion.

Yang Kai smiled awkwardly. "I'm good at fighting, not at this kind of thing. Why not listen to Manager Li's suggestion?"

Hua Youmeng's face brightened and she eagerly looked toward Li Nuo.

Li Nuo pursed her lips and smiled. "If this Lord speaks so highly of me, then I'll be bold. Sister, my suggestion is to auction them as a whole. Set the starting bid at one hundred million Saint Crystals."

"One… one hundred million!" Hua Youmeng's pretty face changed; her voice trembled.

She almost swooned with joy. Her Commerce Guild's twenty to thirty brothers had labored for a year; the largest gains any of them saw were only in the millions of Saint Crystals. After paying for cultivation and the guild's various expenses, what could be saved was at most two hundred thousand.

The figure of one hundred million was simply inconceivable to her.

"Do you think that price is too high?" Li Nuo laughed. "Let's do the math. Tenglong Avenue in the outer city of Purple Star City isn't the wealthiest or most prosperous street, but it's far from poor—middle-tier. In such an area, a shop covering a radius of fifteen zhang would have a deed worth roughly five to eight million; that's already cheap. In the prime districts, you couldn't secure a place for less than twenty million. On Tenglong Avenue, let's say a shop goes for six million. Thirty shops would be one hundred and eighty million. And these deeds are contiguous, making it very convenient for large forces or big trading houses to buy them all and operate off them, so the value should rise by several tenths. Given that, do you still think a starting price of one hundred million is high, Sister?"

Hua Youmeng stood there stunned, unable to speak for a long time, her delicate body trembling.

Li Nuo's words had struck her with overwhelming force.

Though she had previously realized those thirty deeds were valuable, she'd never done the arithmetic. Hearing Li Nuo explain, she truly understood what kind of fortune she had obtained.

It was something her Commerce Guild could not obtain in a lifetime of operations.

Seeing her dazed, Li Nuo did not urge her. Instead she picked up the brewed tea and poured a cup for both Hua Youmeng and Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sipped the cup and asked, "Miss Li, if they are truly auctioned as a whole, how many factions in Purple Star City could afford them?"

“At the very least, there are ten factions capable of it,” she replied. “My lord mustn’t underestimate the powers within Purple Star City. Though gathering several hundred million Saint Crystals wouldn’t be easy, if word were released in advance and they were given some time to prepare, they could still come up with the amount.”

"Very well, then auction them as a whole. President Hua, what do you say?" Yang Kai asked Hua Youmeng.

Hua Youmeng gave a small cry; a flush of excitement colored her face. She stared blankly and said, "I'll follow whatever you decide, my Lord."

"Then it's decided." Yang Kai chuckled, knowing Hua Youmeng was incapable of clear thought at the moment, and took it upon himself to make the decision for her.

"Rest assured, Sir. There are five days until the next auction. I'll make sure to advertise so your guild's deeds fetch a good price," Li Nuo promised Yang Kai earnestly.

"Thank you then." Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"According to our auction house regulations, a successful consignment sale normally draws a five percent fee. But because this transaction is so enormous, I'll give you a discount and charge two percent instead."

Though only three percentage points less, the absolute amount was still a vast number of Saint Crystals given the massive base.

Yang Kai was somewhat surprised but had no reason to refuse. He said, "On behalf of President Hua, I thank Miss Li for the favor."

Li Nuo looked up, detecting more in Yang Kai's words; she was not overly concerned, but smiled and turned to the older woman beside her. “Aunt Chun, bring out two honored guest invitations for this Lord.”

"Yes." Aunt Chun obliged, drawing two golden invitations from her Spatial Ring and placing them before Yang Kai.

Li Nuo smiled as she explained, "At the auction in five days, this Lord and President Hua may enter with these invitations. I'll arrange everything. There will be many fine items; you must attend—perhaps you'll see a treasure you like."

"We'll be there." Yang Kai inclined his head and pocketed the invitations, then called to the still-distracted Hua Youmeng and led her out with a leisurely gait.

Aunt Chun accompanied them to the door of the auction house and only then returned.

"Miss, why are you being so friendly to that man? Is it about the Second Young Master?" Aunt Chun asked Li Nuo, who wore a worried expression.

"Yes. Otherwise, why would I willingly lower the fee by three points? Those three points represent nearly ten million Saint Crystals," Li Nuo said with a rueful laugh, then sighed, "But that man is cautious; he didn't take the favor lightly."

"Indeed." Aunt Chun also sighed.

Yang Kai had said, 'On behalf of President Hua, I thank Miss Li for her kindness.' From that sentence Li Nuo and Aunt Chun inferred he was a cautious man; he had not accepted Li Nuo's favor directly but had instead pushed Hua Youmeng forward, leaving them feeling rather helpless.

"Do we know how the Second Young Master is faring? There was some fighting in the sky awhile ago—did you sense it clearly, Aunt Chun?" Li Nuo asked the woman.

"It ended too quickly," Aunt Chun shook her head. "It seems someone on the Second Young Master's side tried to flee Purple Star City but failed."

"Alas." Li Nuo sighed. "The President is too heartless; they're their own flesh and blood, yet he sent the Second Young Master to such a place, while the Third Young Master enjoys all honors…"

"Miss!" Aunt Chun startled and quickly gave her a reproachful look.

Li Nuo smiled faintly. "I know, Aunt Chun. I'm only complaining to you. We can't investigate everything here nor reveal ourselves rashly; we must use others' hands. That mysterious figure associated with the Commerce Guild commands Lu Tianfeng's respect—he must be formidable and influential. I had hoped he might discreetly probe the Second Young Master's situation, but now it seems impossible."

Aunt Chun frowned. "Don't worry so much, Miss. The Second Young Master may be rash at times, but heaven looks after the righteous; he probably isn't in mortal danger. Purple Star may be powerful, but it won't dare truly harm our people. At worst he will suffer wounds and pain."

"That's what I'm worried about—the Second Young Master has been spoiled for years; he won't stand physical torment well."

Aunt Chun's face hardened with resolve. "If you truly worry, Miss, let me go ask Elder Peng to make inquiries."

"Peng Hu?" Li Nuo frowned. "He's no good—he's lecherous. Aunt Chun, don't go to him!"

"Don't worry, Miss." Aunt Chun smiled slightly. "Though that old Peng Hu is indiscreet, precisely because of that there's an opening. I'll give him something to grease his pockets; he's not as strong as I am—I won't suffer a loss."

With that she made up her mind and declared, "It's settled; I'll go find him now!"

"Chun Yi!" Li Nuo scolded, but the next moment Aunt Chun had already vanished; Li Nuo paced anxiously, silently praying Aunt Chun would not truly be taken advantage of by Peng Hu.

After leaving the Tongtian Auction House, Yang Kai and Hua Youmeng walked side by side. The latter still looked utterly dazed, her cheeks flushed red, her mind clearly elsewhere. Her excitement refused to subside as the same thought kept echoing in her head—one hundred million Saint Crystals…

She glanced at Yang Kai from time to time, gratitude shining in her beautiful eyes.

Had it not been for him, the Commerce Guild would have been wiped out yesterday and all their brothers and sisters slaughtered; there would be no such miraculous fortune. In that moment Hua Youmeng felt a sudden sense that she could lean on him.

That feeling warmed her heart and made her a little enamored.

For so many years Hua Youmeng had commanded the Commerce Guild; as Li Nuo had said, everyone's futures rested on her shoulders. The burden was heavy—no frail body could bear it alone.

Yet this matter had provided someone who could be her pillar, letting her experience the feeling of relying on another.

For a time she could not extricate herself; her mind kept imagining how wonderful it would be if she could always have someone to rely on.
