## Chapter 2418 — I'll Fight You to the End

"Get out of the way, this has nothing to do with you!" Sun Yunxiu waved her hand, sweeping Zi Yu aside. Although her emotions were in turmoil, she still knew her limits—her sweep didn't actually intend to harm Zi Yu.

The next moment, Sun Yunxiu was in front of Yang Kai again. She grabbed his clothes and effortlessly lifted him up, raising her chin slightly as she shouted sternly, "How dare you use Master to toy with us! I'll kill you right now!"

Her voice was fierce, but there wasn't the slightest killing intent in her eyes. In fact, her momentum was even weaker than before, all bark and no bite.

She clearly wasn't trying to kill Yang Kai—she just wanted to use her overwhelming cultivation to force him to tell the truth.

Yang Kai saw through her anxiety at a glance. He didn't resist at all, letting her hold him up as he sneered, "Go on, do it. Why aren't you doing it?"

Sun Yunxiu's silver teeth ground together audibly, but she showed no sign of actually striking. She just stubbornly glared at Yang Kai.

 Yang Kai raised his hand and slapped her across the face, shouting, "Open your eyes and see—what is this!"

Caught off guard, Sun Yunxiu was completely unprepared and took the slap full on, stumbling backward.

All the women were shocked, cold sweat breaking out on their foreheads.

Among all the Senior Sisters, Sun Yunxiu had the fiercest and coldest temper. Her cultivation was at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, which was why she could serve as the Great Elder of Ice Heart Valley. Yet now, in front of so many people, she had been slapped by a man at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

How would this end? Everyone could already imagine Yang Kai being torn to pieces by Sun Yunxiu.

An Ruoyun's expression changed as she frantically considered how to calm her Junior Sister down and save Yang Kai's life. No matter why Yang Kai was so bold as to hit a Second Stage Emperor, just for coming to rescue Zi Yu from her suffering, An Ruoyun couldn't let him be killed.

But to everyone's surprise, after being slapped, Sun Yunxiu didn't explode. Instead, she touched her cheek in astonishment. Then, something appeared in her hand.

 It was a token many found familiar, one that hadn't appeared in three thousand years!

"Ancestor's Token!" Sun Yunxiu stared blankly at the token in her hand. Seeing the large character for "Yun," her eyes instantly filled with tears.

"What?" An Ruoyun's face changed dramatically. She rushed over at once.

"Senior Sister, it's the Ancestor's Token... this is the Ancestor's Token!" Sun Yunxiu cried through her tears, but a smile broke out on her face as she held the token out to An Ruoyun like a precious treasure.

As for being slapped by Yang Kai, she seemed to have forgotten it completely in an instant.

 In this moment, she had none of the dignity of a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert—she was just a little girl seeing something she'd longed for.

An Ruoyun's body trembled violently as she took the token from Sun Yunxiu, feeling its familiar aura and presence. She couldn't control her emotions, and her eyes instantly reddened.

The other Emperor Realm cultivators of Ice Heart Valley also gathered around, staring at the token in a daze. Each of them was breathing rapidly, as if witnessing something unbelievable.

On the other side, when Yao Zhuo heard the words "Ancestor's Token," his heart immediately sank. The only reason Wenqing Sect had been able to suppress Ice Heart Valley all these years was because their founder had vanished for three thousand years. A supreme expert like Bing Yun—wherever she went, there should have been some trace or rumor. Yet, for three thousand years, Bing Yun had disappeared without a single sign.

Many believed she had encountered some danger and perished long ago.

Without Bing Yun, Ice Heart Valley was a toothless tiger, easily bullied by Wenqing Sect.

But now, with the sudden appearance of the Ancestor's Token, did this mean Bing Yun hadn't died, but had been in seclusion all along? If so, Ice Heart Valley's strength would match Wenqing Sect's, and whether Feng Xi and Zi Yu's marriage could proceed as planned was now uncertain.

The Wenqing Sect's Young Sect Master was to be married in two days, and the news had spread throughout the Northern Territory. Invitations had been sent, and many experts had gathered in Binglun City, waiting to enter Ice Heart Valley for the celebration. If the wedding couldn't proceed on time, Wenqing Sect would be utterly humiliated.

And the culprit behind all this was undoubtedly this suddenly-appearing young man.

If he hadn't produced this so-called Ancestor's Token, none of these troubles would have arisen.

 With this thought, Yao Zhuo no longer cared about having Feng Xi kill Yang Kai to remove his heart demon. The best course now was to kill Yang Kai as soon as possible, then have Feng Xi and Zi Yu consummate their marriage tonight. Even if Bing Yun really returned, it would be too late. Thinking this, he shouted, "Boy, you're spouting nonsense! Where did you find that token, daring to pass it off as the Ancestor's Token? Don't be fooled, everyone! If your Founder were truly alive, she would come in person, not just send a Dao Origin Realm brat!"

As soon as he said this, the women of Ice Heart Valley calmed down. Seeing the long-lost Ancestor's Token had made them lose their heads, but Yao Zhuo's words made some sense.

If Bing Yun were still alive, why wouldn't she come herself? She founded Ice Heart Valley, and among the dozen or so Emperor Realm cultivators here, six or seven were her direct disciples. What reason would she have not to come? If she appeared in person, there would be no need for any token.

Yet it was Yang Kai, a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, who brought the Ancestor's Token and claimed to be acting on Bing Yun's orders to take Zi Yu away.

How could a single token convince anyone? For all they knew, Yang Kai might have picked it up somewhere.

An Ruoyun's face paled slightly as she looked at Yang Kai and said, "Young Brother, tell me the truth—who gave you this token? Or did you just find it somewhere...?"

As she asked, her expression was extremely uneasy, afraid Yang Kai would give the answer she dreaded.

Although there had been no news of Master for three thousand years, there was also no definite sign of her death. If Yang Kai had just found this token, then Master must have perished. She couldn't accept that. As acting Valley Lord, she had managed Ice Heart Valley for three thousand years. She hadn't achieved much, but she hadn't made any great mistakes either. Her only regret was failing to protect her disciples. The only thing that kept her going was the belief that one day, Master would return.

She hoped to hand over a whole Ice Heart Valley to Master when that day came—not for praise, but for peace of mind, because she had done her utmost to protect what Master had built.

If she learned from Yang Kai that Master had died, she would surely collapse.

"If you dare lie, I'll make sure you can't live or die!" Sun Yunxiu was far less patient than An Ruoyun. She glared fiercely at Yang Kai, refusing to miss the slightest change in his expression.

Yang Kai replied coldly, "If I say Bing Yun herself gave it to me, would you believe it?"

An Ruoyun immediately relaxed, nodding repeatedly, "I believe you! I believe you!"

Sun Yunxiu seemed to lose all her strength, her face showing relief. She no longer looked so fierce at Yang Kai, and the others were drenched in sweat, as if they'd just survived a fierce battle.

Even though they couldn't be sure Yang Kai was telling the truth, at least now everyone had hope—something to look forward to.

"You women are far too naive. This brat is clearly fooling you. Let this Lord force the truth out of him!" Yao Zhuo shouted, suddenly unleashing his Imperial Might and pressing his hand down toward Yang Kai.

Judging by his murderous intent, he wasn't trying to force the truth—he clearly meant to kill.

"Old bastard, bullying the weak with your strength—shameless!" Yang Kai's bones creaked as he narrowed his eyes and shouted.

As he spoke, he tried to tear open space and dodge the attack.

But the Second Stage Emperor's Imperial Might was unexpectedly fierce. The overwhelming pressure sealed off the space around him, leaving him stuck as if in a mire. He struggled with all his might, but could only move a little—he couldn't dodge at all.

His eyes narrowed as he felt the breath of death rushing toward him.

At this moment, the Emperor Realm cultivators of Ice Heart Valley were still reeling from their emotional turmoil. No one expected Yao Zhuo to suddenly try to kill Yang Kai.

By the time An Ruoyun and Sun Yunxiu realized what was happening and tried to help, it was already too late. They could only watch as the palm struck toward Yang Kai.

"Stop!" An Ruoyun shouted, her long sleeve flicking out as a white ribbon-like Secret Treasure shot toward Yao Zhuo.

"If you hurt him, I'll make sure you die with no grave!" Sun Yunxiu was even more direct. She raised her sword, her body wrapped in sword light as she slashed at Yao Zhuo.

In the next instant, the remaining Emperor Realm cultivators all attacked, unleashing secret techniques and Secret Treasures at Yao Zhuo.

In an instant, chaos erupted. The laws and profound intent of ice spread, as if freezing the entire world.

Facing so many Emperor Realm attacks, Yao Zhuo didn't back down. Instead, his moves grew even fiercer, clearly intent on killing Yang Kai.

Yang Kai could see clearly that the Emperor Realm cultivators of Ice Heart Valley couldn't save him. Before they could reach him, Yao Zhuo would strike. Even if he survived, he'd be gravely injured.

At the brink of life and death, Yang Kai gritted his teeth. Suddenly, a bead appeared in his hand. He poured Origin Qi into it, and in the blink of an eye, the bead drained almost all his strength. Pale-faced, he hurled the bead at Yao Zhuo and shouted, "I'll fight you to the end! Take this, old bastard!"
