## Chapter 1869 — Spirit Tablets Shattered

At the very same time Yang Kai was sweeping clean the Purple Star's Treasure Vault, another bout of open and hidden strife was unfolding inside the ancestral hall of Purple Star Palace.

Since Zi Wuji had decided to confront Gongsun Liang today, he naturally no longer held back as before; he was aggressive and brimming with confidence.

Gongsun Liang had undoubtedly noticed this, but he only watched coldly and did not take it to heart.

Many of Purple Star's senior figures vaguely sensed that the atmosphere was different today and felt secretly anxious, yet everything proceeded smoothly and the rites to worship Heaven and Earth continued without incident.

Half a day later, everyone poured into the ancestral hall to carry out the final ancestral-offering ceremony.

The offerings had long been prepared. Purple Star's senior members, arranged according to rank and strength, stood in four rows below. Gongsun Liang eloquently recounted the great deeds of Purple Star's forebears, and the hall was heavy and solemn; pride and a sense of belonging rose in every heart as they felt proud to belong to Purple Star.

Gongsun Liang stood solemn at last and called out in a resonant voice, “Forebears and ancestors above, today I, your unworthy descendant, Gongsun Liang, offer sacrifices on behalf of all Purple Star. May the spirits of our ancestors bless Purple Star with flourishing martial fortune, unending through the ages. Present the incense!”

Immediately someone presented the three prepared sticks of Dragon Saliva Incense.

Gongsun Liang was about to take them when a low shout came: “Great Elder, wait!”

Gongsun Liang frowned and turned toward the source of the voice. Narrowing his eyes slightly, he said, “If Second Young Master has something to say, wait until I finish offering these three sticks of incense. No one is permitted to disturb the ancestral rite.”

Zi Wuji smiled faintly. “Great Elder speaks reasonably, but Wuji believes it would be improper for these three sticks to be offered by the Great Elder.”

“I am the Great Elder of Purple Star. It's merely offering three sticks to the ancestors—what's improper?” Gongsun Liang said calmly, his half-closed eyes radiating a pressure like solid matter as he stared at Zi Wuji.

Zi Wuji remained untroubled and said without changing color, “In past years this ceremony was presided over by my Father and Eldest Brother. Now that both my Father and Eldest Brother are not in Purple Star, this matter should appropriately be handled by Wuji.”

“The Second Young Master wishes to offer these three sticks?”

“Exactly!”

“Heh, Second Young Master, you jest. The Lord and the Young Master are not in Purple Star; I, as Great Elder of Purple Star, should relieve them of their burdens. This matter does not require your concern—step down.”

“Great Elder, Purple blood flows through Wuji's veins, and Purple Star is the Zi family's foundation. Wuji has an unshirkable duty in this matter.”

“You insist?” Gongsun Liang stared at Zi Wuji coldly.

“I ask the Great Elder to consent.” Zi Wuji replied without subservience, looking back steadily.

Gongsun Liang chuckled and allowed his Saint Yuan to turn subtly within him. He intended to use it to pressure Zi Wuji; offering incense was just one step of the rite, but it carried extraordinary significance. If he conceded today, it would mean recognizing Zi Wuji's status, and Gongsun Liang would not allow that.

What Gongsun Liang could not have imagined was that as soon as his Saint Yuan moved, a series of cracking sounds suddenly came from all around.

The next moment, countless exclamations rose.

Gongsun Liang's face darkened as he swept his gaze across Zi Wuji's smug smile; a bad premonition rose within him.

“The spirit tablets are breaking!”

“What?”

“My heavens—each ancestor's spirit tablet has shattered.”

Shouts from many of Purple Star's elders suddenly echoed around. Gongsun Liang turned and his old face went deathly pale in an instant.

The ancestral tablets displayed on the platform were, at this moment, mostly fractured; even the few that remained whole were split by countless cracks and looked as if they would collapse at any time.

These tablets represented Purple Star's generations of ancestors—those who had contributed immeasurably. Each tablet belonged to a famed master, a figure so revered that Purple Star's millions of martial artists bowed to them.

After their deaths, their tablets had been placed here to be revered for generations.

They embodied a spirit, a faith.

No one dared to be disrespectful to them; even the contemporary head, Zi Long, would enter here with utmost reverence.

Yet now these symbols, this faith, were all turning to dust.

Gongsun Liang was shaken to his core and spun to glare at Zi Wuji.

After all, among them stood the ancestral tablets of his own Gongsun family.

Before he could speak, Zi Wuji spat a mouthful of blood and looked mournful and crushed, pointing a trembling finger at Gongsun Liang as he said, “Great Elder… you wield such cruel means. Even if you could punish an upstart to teach a lesson, there was no need to shatter the ancestors' tablets. Do you still have any regard for Purple Star?”

Gongsun Liang was taken aback, then shouted angrily, “Zi Wuji, cease your nonsense—”

“Nonsense?” Zi Wuji wiped the blood from his mouth and sneered, “Many present in the hall saw everything clearly—how could I be speaking nonsense? Yes, I offended you earlier, but you… you would not go so far as to do this?”

“Great Elder, you have gone too far! Each ancestor's tablet contains a bound spirit; by destroying the tablets you have annihilated the vessels that housed those souls, consigning them to true oblivion. How can you face them?” someone cried out in indignation.

“Betraying our teachers and annihilating our ancestors—Great Elder, what are you doing?”

“Great Elder, you owe us an explanation!”

A group of warriors rose behind Zi Wuji to accuse Gongsun Liang. Zi Wuji's face was bitter and resentful as he clutched his chest, yet a look of triumph still danced at the corner of his eye.

Gongsun Liang's expression was as cold as water; by now he fully knew he had fallen into someone else's trap. He had indeed stirred his Saint Yuan moments ago, but only to give Zi Wuji a small lesson—he never imagined that the Saint Yuan's fluctuation would shatter those tablets.

The degree of Saint Yuan fluctuation could not possibly have produced such an effect.

The only explanation was that those tablets had been tampered with beforehand and his Saint Yuan merely served as a catalyst.

“Zi Wuji! I underestimated you. You actually have the audacity!” Gongsun Liang did not attempt to argue; he looked at Zi Wuji with a mix of admiration and contempt. To have tampered with ancestor tablets was beyond what Gongsun Liang had ever imagined—this daring and ruthlessness forced him to respect Zi Wuji's decisiveness and cruelty.

“What did you mean by that, Great Elder? Wuji does not understand—please give a reasonable explanation for these tablets!” Zi Wuji refused to relent, determined to tear all pretenses apart with Gongsun Liang today.

“Explanation?” Gongsun Liang sneered. His gaze swept across the strong figures behind Zi Wuji; each man he looked at changed expression and averted his eyes in terror.

Although these followers had been won over by Zi Wuji's boldness and methods, the Great Elder was still the Great Elder—his authority made them uneasy about openly opposing him.

Zi Wuji saw this and inwardly cursed them as useless. He twisted, blocking Gongsun Liang's line of sight, and hissed, “Great Elder, do you truly hold our ancestors in such contempt? With your arrogance, what right have you to occupy the Great Elder's seat?”

“Is that what you mean?” Gongsun Liang's anger turned to derisive laughter. “Boy, you are indeed capable; without Donglai's presence, Purple Star under your leadership might climb another rung. But alas… you are destined to be a mere clown. You want an explanation? I will give you one!”

Saying so, Gongsun Liang stepped forward in a single motion and reached to seize Zi Wuji.

He understood this had been set up to target him. Whether the tablets had been tampered with earlier was irrelevant; the fact remained that he had shattered them and could not deny it.

Since he could not argue the point, he would not bother trying.

There’s more than one way to reason with someone — it doesn’t have to be done with words. A fist can make the point just as well.

As Gongsun Liang moved to seize him, Zi Wuji, far from alarmed, showed relief and put on a desperate-looking act, retreating while crying, “Gongsun Liang, will you really use force in the ancestral hall? This is the gravest of disrespect to our forebears and tantamount to betraying Purple Star! Though you committed a grave fault, you are still the Great Elder. If you secluded yourself for ten years in the hall to repent, perhaps you could be forgiven—why do you persist in this madness?”

No matter what, they would pin that heavy label on him first so that Gongsun Liang would have no way out.

“Presumptuous! I act as I please—who are you to lecture me?” Gongsun Liang barked, not taking Zi Wuji seriously at all.

Just as he reached out to seize Zi Wuji, a ghostly figure suddenly rushed in from outside and intervened, placing himself squarely between Gongsun Liang and Zi Wuji.

Gongsun Liang's face changed and his grab became a palm strike as he pushed forward.

The newcomer met him with a palm in return.

The two palms met in silence, and both figures were forced back.

Only then did an explosive sound of energy erupt from the space between their palms, scattering through the void. In an instant the ancestral hall collapsed, and the Purple Star Palace shook as if an earthquake had struck.

Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…

Purple Star's strong ones were blasted out from the rubble, each of them looking as if they'd lost their parents as they peered down in mourning.

The ancestral hall, which had stood for tens of thousands of years and been regarded as a sacred symbol by all Purple Star martial artists, had been destroyed today.

A sour feeling rose in everyone's hearts and their faces fell.

In midair Zi Wuji's face went white and he was seized by a sense of fear.

Although everything had been part of his plan, the moment Gongsun Liang had lunged at him he had felt the approach of doom—before a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, he had no strength to resist.

Strength—only strength—was true power. Zi Wuji clenched his fists and hardened his heart.

On the other side, Gongsun Liang narrowed his eyes and looked toward the figure who had blocked Zi Wuji.

He looked to be about thirty years old, a refined and dignified man. The corners of his eyes carried a trace of worldly weariness, giving him an air of mature steadiness.
