## Chapter 2445 — Found When Least Expected

In this Shattered Star Sea, it is possible for cultivators to break through to the Emperor Realm. Every time the Shattered Star Sea opens, quite a few people glimpse the mysteries of the Emperor Realm and soar to the heavens in a single bound, like a carp leaping over the dragon gate.

So Yang Kai couldn’t help but have this suspicion.

But then, thinking it over, he felt something was off. This didn’t seem like the commotion caused by someone advancing; at the very least, Yang Kai hadn’t sensed the Baptism from Heaven and Earth that always accompanied a breakthrough to a higher realm.

If it’s not a breakthrough, then could it be the emergence of an Imperial Treasure?

Realizing this, Yang Kai’s expression changed, and he hurriedly changed direction, flying toward that place.

He’d heard before that in the Shattered Star Sea, some extremely high-grade Imperial Treasures would occasionally appear, because back then, more than just the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor died in the Shattered Star Sea—several other Great Emperors were buried here as well.

The treasures once possessed by these Great Emperors who fell here were also left behind in the Shattered Star Sea. As the years passed and the tides of time shifted, these artifacts quietly awaited the arrival of those destined to find them.

So, any Imperial Treasure that emerges in the Shattered Star Sea carries extraordinary significance and immense value, enough to incite countless people to fight over it.

The Imperial Treasures of the Great Emperors are fundamentally different from ordinary Imperial Treasures. To compare them would be like the difference between an Imperial Treasure and a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure—simply immeasurable.

Naturally, no one would miss out on such a good thing.

As Yang Kai flew toward the source of Imperial Might, he suddenly felt the world tremble. Immediately after, a deep, resonant sound like a morning bell or evening drum thundered from ahead. The sound wave was visible to the naked eye, sweeping out in all directions like a violent gale, containing terrifying power.

Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. He quickly circulated his cultivation technique, dropping downward while guarding his mind.

Crash—

The ground all around was overturned as if plowed open, making one feel as though the end of the world had arrived.

The shockwave struck, and Yang Kai instantly lost his balance, seeing stars. His mind was muddled, with only that massive bell sound echoing endlessly, nearly causing him to lose control of his consciousness.

Startled, he hurriedly activated the power of the Warm Spirit Lotus, cleansing his Sea of Consciousness. Only then did he snap out of that daze.

Looking around again, Yang Kai sucked in a cold breath. The surrounding landscape had changed dramatically—several small peaks had risen from flat ground, while the original mountains had vanished without a trace. Countless abyss-like ravines appeared on the earth, making one shudder at the sight. The whole world seemed to have turned gloomy in an instant.

He looked on in horror.

Such terrifying power was absolutely not something the cultivators training in the Shattered Star Sea could unleash. The only explanation was the might of the newly emerged Imperial Treasure!

It must be a Great Emperor’s treasure! Yang Kai’s heart burned with excitement. He wiped the blood from his nose and sped forward like lightning.

Shadows flickered all around, clothes fluttering in the wind. Clearly, many other cultivators had the same idea and were rushing over as well.

Yang Kai cursed inwardly. As expected, none of the people who came to the Shattered Star Sea were simple. Even he had suffered a minor injury just now, yet none of these people had been killed by that sound!

Soon, he arrived not far from the source of the sound, hovering in midair. Looking ahead, his gaze sharpened.

A strangely shaped mountain peak appeared about a thousand zhang ahead. The peak was around thirty zhang tall, with a peculiar shape, looking just like a giant bell overturned on the ground.

Halfway up the mountain, rubble kept tumbling down. From within the peak, beams of dazzling light shot out, filled with dense Imperial Aura.

“Imperial Treasure!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, instantly realizing that the mountain was where the Imperial Treasure lay.

The other cultivators who had rushed over clearly realized this as well, but the might of the Imperial Treasure just now had been too terrifying. So, although they had all arrived, none dared to act rashly.

In front of the mountain, several broken corpses lay sprawled on the ground, all bleeding from their seven orifices, looking utterly miserable. Who knows which Sect these unlucky fellows came from. Judging by how and where they died, they must have been the first to discover the Imperial Treasure, but were killed on the spot by its backlash when they tried to take it.

Beams of starlight shot from the corpses; the dead's Star Seals hovered briefly, then, as if drawn, shot off in all directions toward the crowd.

One especially bright Star Seal flew straight toward where Yang Kai was.

How could Yang Kai let such a good thing slip by? He immediately flickered forward to meet the Star Seal.

At the same time, countless cultivators moved, fixing their gazes on the Star Seals and reaching out to snatch them.

Like Yang Kai, there were about seven or eight other cultivators eyeing this Star Seal, all with impressive cultivation—many at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

But while they were fast, Yang Kai was no slower.

He slightly mobilized the Power of Space, snatching the Star Seal before anyone else could.

But just as he got hold of the Star Seal, a figure suddenly shot toward him, reaching out and grabbing his hand. However, since the other party hadn’t used any Origin Qi or shown any hostility, Yang Kai didn’t react much.

But this person was so fast! Yang Kai was a bit surprised, since he hadn’t sensed anyone who could threaten his hold on the Star Seal before. If he’d been any slower, it would have been snatched away.

The cultivator who was just a step away from grabbing the Star Seal was unbelievably fast. Without the Spatial Power, Yang Kai wouldn’t have been able to compete at all.

Yang Kai looked at the person in surprise. When he saw their face clearly, he couldn’t help but grin. “So we meet again.”

He realized that the cultivator who’d caught his attention wasn’t anyone else, but the same androgynous person he’d met before.

“You again!” The woman also saw Yang Kai, her brows knitting in annoyance as she complained, “Why do you haunt me like a ghost? Everywhere I go, you’re there to snatch my things!”

She’d just had a Firecloud Ganoderma snatched by Yang Kai, and now he’d taken a Star Seal right in front of her. Was this man sent by the heavens just to steal her things?

Yang Kai chuckled. “Miss, you make it sound like I’m always chasing after you. Don’t worry, I’m not that interested in women with small chests!”

The woman’s face instantly turned cold, her silver teeth grinding audibly. Small chest, flat butt—these were her greatest regrets in life, and now Yang Kai had said it to her face. How could she possibly look pleased?

“Say one more word and I’ll tear your mouth off!” she threatened viciously.

Yang Kai grinned and said, “Then you’d better let go of my hand first. If you keep holding on like this, I might have to cry out that you’re taking advantage of me.”

At his words, the woman snorted, withdrew her hand, and turned to descend.

The other cultivators who’d failed to snatch the Star Seal stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, their expressions extremely odd.

When Yang Kai glanced over, they all shivered, faces turning pale as they retreated several steps, widening the distance between them.

Yang Kai frowned, not understanding their reaction. But the next moment, he realized and said with a dark face, “That person’s a woman. Did you all think I was into men…?”

At his words, their faces grew even paler, and they scattered in an instant, vanishing from sight.

Yang Kai was left speechless, thinking that now, no matter what, he’d been smeared with mud—guilty or not, it was all the same.

He swept his gaze around in annoyance, but the next moment, he had no time to care about such trivialities. His eyes lit up as he looked in a certain direction, where a familiar figure was fighting over a Star Seal in midair. The person’s attacks were ruthless and their cultivation extraordinary. Although their opponent was also at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, they were clearly no match and were being beaten back again and again.

Yin Lesheng!

Yang Kai never expected to run into Yin Lesheng so easily. Although he’d deduced from clues revealed by Zhong Zhenyong that Yin Lesheng was on this star, he hadn’t known his exact whereabouts.

Yet now, he’d actually seen Yin Lesheng!

Clearly, this guy had also been drawn here by the commotion.

Yang Kai’s emotions stirred slightly. Thinking quickly, he flew downward, then took something from his Spatial Ring and stuck it to his face, circulating his Origin Qi.

In the blink of an eye, he transformed into a burly man, looking nothing like before.

This face-changing mask was something he’d looted from Sangde’s Spatial Ring. Back in the Jixu Secret Realm, Sangde had relied on this Secret Treasure to change his appearance and leave Tongtian City unnoticed. Otherwise, with his fame and status, he’d never have been able to slip away by sea.

Sangde might not have been much as a person, but his artifact refining skills were top-notch. The Secret Treasure he personally crafted was extremely effective—even close acquaintances wouldn’t recognize Yang Kai, unless an Emperor Realm expert used Divine Sense to scan him.

The reason Yang Kai wanted to change his appearance wasn’t because he feared Yin Lesheng, but because he didn’t want to alert him. To find out about Xiaoxiao, he’d have to capture Yin Lesheng alive, which was much harder than just defeating or killing him. Judging by Yin Lesheng’s current performance, he was one of the few true experts in the Dao Origin Realm, and likely had some trump cards up his sleeve.

Yang Kai had just finished changing his appearance when he sensed a strange gaze on him.

He turned and saw it was that androgynous person again.

She had clearly seen all his actions just now.

Yang Kai didn’t mind, just grinned and flew over to her, cupping his fists politely. “May I ask your name, Miss?”

The woman frowned, looking a bit impatient, but still replied, “Lan He!”

“So it’s Miss Lan He. I’m Yang Kai!”
