## Chapter 1925 — The Gathering of the Mighty

Hearing Ghost Ancestor say that, Ye Xijun gently nodded: “The Dark Star today is indeed somewhat different from decades past, yet such changes occur imperceptibly; few are able to notice them, but this time it is obvious.”

“That means that brat made great progress this time — he might even have broken through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm,” Ghost Ancestor grinned, his form wrapped in black qi, lending him a sinister air.

The faster a Star Lord’s strength rose, the greater the benefit the corresponding star could receive; the two were bound together in shared honor and shame.

“The Third Stage of the Void King Realm…” Ye Xijun murmured to herself, not knowing when she might manage to break through to that realm.

She longed to go to the Star Realm more than anyone—for within that Star Realm lay the home of the Starry Sky Great Emperor!

When the Great Emperor had left before, she had not been able to follow, and it had become her regret.

The ripples in the distant void were not perceived only by Ye Xijun and Ghost Ancestor; countless people across the Dark Star had sensed them.

There was no need to mention Su Yan, Xia Ningshang and Qian Tong — those three at the Void King Realm were far more perceptive than most; many at the Origin Returning Realm also all turned their gaze skyward.

They could not see much, only one rainbow of energy after another piercing through from the depths of the Star Domain, pouring into every corner of the Dark Star and enriching its Spiritual Qi.

In the distant Death Domain, Yang Kai stood naked in the void, motionless, his expression strange as he frowned.

He himself could not quite make sense of his current condition.

For these years he had cultivated in the Death Domain, comprehending Imperial Might, probing the laws; he had even made use of that one Void Mind Crystal.

He had believed he could break through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm!

But for some reason he always fell short by a hair, leaving his cultivation stuck at the pinnacle of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

The most obvious sign was that he had not condensed a Void Mind Crystal of his own within his body!

The Void Mind Crystal was the essence and insight of a Void King Realm warrior’s lifelong cultivation; without a Void Mind Crystal, one was not a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert.

Although his realm had failed to advance, under the immense pressure of the Death Domain his Undying Five Elements Sword had broken through among the Five Elements Treasures, all materials except the Sun's True Essence had been consumed and absorbed by him.

Beyond that, his Domain Field was also approaching consummation!

So even without a breakthrough, Yang Kai felt much stronger than before his seclusion.

“The chance hasn’t arrived? Or am I missing something?” Yang Kai could not understand.

A warrior’s path destined one to endure trials; nothing could be forced. Though he had not advanced this time, he was not disheartened. He was confident he was no weaker than anyone else; if others could ascend to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, he could too — he simply needed more time.

“Forget it for now; at present my strength is hardly worse than theirs — I can easily open the road to the Star Realm.” Yang Kai relaxed, took out a fresh set of clothes from his Spatial Ring, donned them, and in a flash crossed hundreds of thousands of li to return to the Dark Star.

As a Star Lord, such matters were effortless for him.

After returning to the sect, Yang Kai did not rouse many people; he only met with his family.

A few days later he led Su Yan and Xia Ningshang through the Great Space Array and departed the Dark Star.

For the following year no one knew of his whereabouts.

A year — neither long nor short.

One day a year later, the Great Space Array of the Lingxiao Sect suddenly shone with a milky light, and two figures emerged from that radiance.

Ye Xijun and Ghost Ancestor had long been waiting; when the newcomers arrived Ye Xijun saluted and looked at the burly man, asking, “Are you Chairman Ai Ou of the Hengluo Commerce Guild?”

The man nodded slightly and smiled, “Indeed, I am Ai.”

“Ye Xijun of Lingxiao Sect, greetings, Chairman Ai Ou!”

“So Elder Ye — I have long heard your name!” Ai Ou cupped his fist. He had learned of Lingxiao Sect’s situation from Yang Kai.

Ye Xijun then turned to the other person and smiled, “And this must be Senior Long Tianshang.”

“I’m honored.” Long Tianshang returned the salute with a genial manner.

“You two arrived early.” Ghost Ancestor chuckled from the side.

Ai Ou and Long Tianshang’s gazes both sharpened and fixed upon Ghost Ancestor. Though his aura made people uneasy, both knew he was a peer worthy of standing with them — a Third Stage of the Void King Realm powerhouse.

They dared not be careless and exchanged a round of polite greetings.

“Where is that boy Yang Kai? Why is he not here to welcome us?” Ai Ou was somewhat displeased — after all, he was Yang Kai’s nominal father-in-law; how could a father-in-law come and be left unwelcomed by his son-in-law?

“The Sect Master has not yet returned; I do not know where he went, but he certainly would not miss the appointed time,” Ye Xijun explained.

“That stinky brat!” Ai Ou sneered, curling his lip. “He’s surely off roaming about somewhere, enjoying himself and has forgotten the time.”

Long Tianshang laughed heartily: “A year ago he went to the Hengluo Commerce Guild and took Xue Yue away; didn’t he tell you where he was going?”

Ai Ou’s face darkened: “That brat appears and disappears at will; I haven’t even consented and he already absconded with Xue Yue. Back then he had three women with him, all at the Void King Realm — I don’t know where he found them.”

“Three women?” Ye Xijun’s brows rose. “Of the three Chairman Ai Ou mentioned, two should be the Sect Master’s two Senior Sisters; they were indeed at the Void King Realm — but who was the other one?”

No sooner had Ye Xijun finished speaking than someone said, “That other one is my adopted daughter!”

At that moment the Great Space Array flashed again and from it stepped a graceful, peerlessly beautiful figure, followed by a burly man like a bear.

Ai Ou and Long Tianshang were startled and hastily turned. When Ai Ou saw her he almost popped his eyes out and blurted, "Chi Yue! How is it you, you old she‑devil!"

The newcomer was none other than Lady Chi Yue of Yao Star Di Chen, now the only Yao King on the entire Di Chen Star!

From Ai Ou’s tone it was clear the two knew each other.

No wonder — Void King Realm powerhouses were few in the Star Domain, and those above the Second Stage were rarer still; even if they had never met they had long heard each other’s names.

Chi Yue let out a cold laugh. “What now—if a boor like you can set foot in this place, why shouldn’t this Lord be able to?”

Ai Ou snorted, “Long time no see and your mouth is as sharp as ever. I did not expect that brat Yang Kai would have ties with your yao; what surprised me more was that you’ve also reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.”

“Aren’t you the same?” Chi Yue smiled faintly at Ai Ou.

Ai Ou narrowed his eyes, “So you are one of the six?”

“Aren’t you?” Chi Yue retorted.

“Of course I am. Yang Kai is my son-in-law too; if he invites me how could I refuse?” Ai Ou said proudly.

“Sorry, Yang Kai is also my son-in-law,” Chi Yue sneered.

The two powerful ones glared at each other and suddenly cursed in unison, “How many women does that stinky brat have?!”

A year ago Yang Kai had gone to the Hengluo Commerce Guild and taken Xue Yue; he likewise went to Di Chen and took Shan Qingluo. With Su Yan and Xia Ningshang following him, he had gathered four peerless beauties at his side.

Moreover, all four were First Stage of the Void King Realm experts!

During Yang Kai’s seclusion Xue Yue had also broken through to the Void King Realm in those few years, not having wasted her talent.

“Who among the young is not gallant!” Long Tianshang laughed, “You two should be content — having Yang Kai as a son-in-law is a great bargain.”

Ai Ou frowned, “That may be so, but I am still somewhat unwilling.”

Chi Yue coldly said, “When he returns, I'll give him a good thrashing first!”

Ai Ou nodded vigorously in agreement; the two were suddenly united on this point.

“You are all honored guests of Lingxiao Sect. The Sect Master has not returned; I will attend to matters here. Please enter and rest; Lingxiao Sect’s scenery is quite pleasant!” Ye Xijun said, stepping aside to gesture them in.

None objected; they followed Ye Xijun into the Lingxiao Sect and were placed upon one of the main peaks.

Over the following days, more honored guests arrived.

Gu Cangyun, Alliance Master of the Sword Alliance, brought Gu Jianxin through the Great Space Array to Lingxiao Sect.

The elusive Wudao also passed through the Great Space Array and arrived at Lingxiao Sect.

Ye Xijun arranged accommodations for them all with due care, ensuring no one felt neglected.

Now Lingxiao Sect had as many as six Third Stage of the Void King Realm powerhouses gathered together.

This would have been impossible before. Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts were always elusive; no one knew where they secluded themselves to comprehend the Dao, yet now they had assembled together.

Such a rare opportunity excited many Void King Realm experts.

Once gathered, they sat upon a main peak of Lingxiao Sect to discuss the Martial Dao and exchange cultivation experiences; their debate stirred the Spiritual Qi, and the wondrous sounds spread to all directions, greatly benefiting many Lingxiao Sect disciples.

The sense of time had long faded for those Void King Realm experts; once the six Third Stage powerhouses sat down, a month passed. During that month the peak constantly rang with their disputations, voices resonating and secrets splashing through the void.

Even decades later the traces of those Third Stage deliberations remained on that main peak; many Lingxiao Sect disciples liked to seclude there to probe mysteries, hoping to glimpse the secrets.

A month later the long-dormant Great Space Array flashed again.

This time five figures emerged from it.

One man, four women.

The man in the center was Yang Kai; the other four were naturally Su Yan, Xia Ningshang, Shan Qingluo and Xue Yue.
