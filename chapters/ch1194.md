## Chapter 1194 — Frenzied Absorption

Those golden threads drawn in by the Warm Spirit Lotus and surging into the Sea of Consciousness—Yang Kai only had time to merge one percent of them; the rest were seized by the Warm Spirit Lotus, and the six-colored radiance instantly shone even more brilliantly than before.

A jolt ran through him; he hurriedly checked the Warm Spirit Lotus's pulling power, no longer daring to make such a commotion.

If he were alone here, Yang Kai would have welcomed it with delight rather than suppress it.

But there were more than thirty people present now; if such a disturbance were to be raised, he would inevitably be noticed and then expelled! If he could so wildly absorb the medicinal effects of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, what hope would others have of absorbing anything?

Although Yang Kai suppressed the pull quickly, it still alerted the beauty who had been speaking with him and sat at his side.

The beauty opened her eyes suspiciously and gave Yang Kai a strange look; in that moment she had clearly sensed a slightly abnormal attraction emanating from this First Stage of the Saint King Realm youth, yet when she probed carefully there was no motion at all.

She secretly shook her head, thinking it a trick of her senses, closed her eyes and continued to absorb the benefits contained within the Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

Yang Kai breathed a silent sigh of relief; he did not know the Warm Spirit Lotus hungered so fiercely for the Soul Cleansing Divine Water—had he known earlier he would have gone to a more secluded corner and then could have been a little freer.

Even now he could act that way, but Yang Kai had to be extremely cautious; he must under no circumstances arouse suspicion, especially not from the beauty sitting not far from him.

With that thought, Yang Kai gradually relaxed his suppression of the Warm Spirit Lotus, stopping only after it had loosened to a certain degree.

In an instant about ten times more golden threads surged into the Sea of Consciousness than before; one percent of them was devoured by Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, while the rest continued to flow into the Six-Colored Treasure Isle as before.

That rate was just right—he would not be discovered, and Yang Kai could still reap considerable benefit; at present the effects he alone was absorbing from the Soul Cleansing Divine Water equaled the total of ten ordinary people.

Yet Yang Kai was not fully satisfied and felt a touch of impatience.

There was only this one pool of Soul Cleansing Divine Water and everyone was scrambling for it; sooner or later it would be used up. If one does not look out for oneself, who will? At a moment like this, it was only sensible to seize as much as possible.

Unlike the others who were wholly focused on absorbing the medicinal effects of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense cultivation was incomparably strong, allowing him at this moment to divert part of his mind to do other things.

He planned to secretly appraise the others; if they were immersed and unable to extricate themselves, he would increase his absorption speed. With a little caution, he shouldn't be discovered.

Besides, it would be best to move further away from that beauty; her strength was not high—only Third Stage of the Saint King Realm—but she was far too sensitive.

With those thoughts, Yang Kai quietly swam toward a remote corner.

Although his movement roused several warriors who opened their eyes and shot him displeased looks, no one had the heart or the leisure to reprimand him; they merely glanced before closing their eyes to seize every moment.

A short while later, Yang Kai finally reached a corner of the pool. The spot was quite secluded, with almost no one choosing to stay there — something that greatly pleased him.

Just as he crossed his legs to sit and prepare to let loose, Yang Kai suddenly felt something prick the underside of his butt.

He hurriedly reached down and picked it up; it felt somewhat warm in his hand, but before he could examine it a strange energy surged from his fingertips into his body, racing straight toward his mind.

Wherever that energy passed, Yang Kai's skin chilled and an instinctive sense of crisis welled up in him.

He did not dare to delay and hastily condensed Saint Yuan to block it.

Demonic Flame raged within his meridians; a faint, barely audible wail seemed to sound in his ears, and that yin-cold energy, apparently fearful of the Demonic Flame's terror, dared not advance, instead retreating rapidly and being forced out of his body—disappearing back into the pool.

Yang Kai's face changed drastically!

He opened his eyes and looked around at the others, only to find that none of them had noticed the commotion here; as if only he had heard that wail.

Furthermore, the object he'd been holding no longer felt warm; it had become plain and unremarkable.

Whatever it was, for such a thing to appear in the Soul Cleansing Divine Water it could not be ordinary. Without hesitation Yang Kai tossed it into his Spatial Ring, planning to inspect it carefully after he left.

His brow furrowed as he scanned the golden pool for the yin-cold energy that had rushed into him, but the pool was opaque to the eye and his Divine Sense could not pierce it; after searching for a long time he found nothing.

Still, since that energy had feared his Demonic Flame, Yang Kai was not worried it would harm him again.

What left him puzzled was what that thing actually was and how it could exist here.

He shook his head inwardly and stopped thinking about it, quietly loosening his suppression of the Warm Spirit Lotus further so it would draw the golden threads a bit faster.

The stone chamber fell into an eerie silence; everyone sat in the pool, crazily refining their Divine Sense, and their luck seemed to be good—since they had leapt into the pool, no one had managed to find this stalactite cave again.

Apparently those who had received the notice had all come here.

About half an incense stick later, an extraordinary change occurred.

A vast surge of soul energy suddenly rippled outward — the strength of that Divine Sense was comparable to that of an expert at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. It swept through the entire stone chamber, and all the cultivators sitting within the pool opened their eyes in shock, turning toward the source of the power.

At the sight, some were shocked, some envious, and some utterly dumbfounded...

The source of the commotion was the indifferent man seated in the very center of the pool; his face twitched with an extremely strange expression that shifted constantly—now joy, now a frown—looking exceedingly odd.

Around his body a conspicuous ring of golden light swirled, and his flesh seemed like a bottomless pit—countless golden threads were crazily burrowing into him, the turmoil so obvious the whole pool became unsettled.

"He actually comprehended it!" the beauty's lips parted and she stared at the indifferent man in disbelief, exclaiming.

Hearing her, everyone realized: the gains the indifferent man had drawn from the pool were not merely a tempering of his Divine Sense to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, but also the comprehension of some Soul Technique once wielded by the Void King Realm expert who had died here.

This made everyone's eyes redden.

Compared with a Void King Realm Soul Technique, the tiny benefits they had just received were utterly negligible!

For a time everyone stared at him blankly, having forgotten to continue absorbing the Soul Cleansing Divine Water's effects.

None wore a sourer face than Qu Changfeng; earlier he had vented his anger on Yang Kai and at last calmed somewhat—after all, from his current spot he could still gain benefits and there was no need to squabble.

Yet now someone else had comprehended a Void King Realm Soul Technique while he had only slightly tempered his Divine Sense; by comparison the benefits were worlds apart.

Why? Why should a Soul Technique be comprehended by that man? Why wasn't it his turn? He was a peerless genius adorned with countless brilliant honors within the Battle Sky Alliance, worshiped by many—how could he not have the chance?

Was it simply because that man alone occupied the best position at the center, covering a three zhang radius?

Qu Changfeng felt so depressed he might vomit blood! Yet he could only watch with jealous eyes, daring not to interfere.

Although this was the prime moment to disrupt that indifferent man's comprehension, who knew how mighty his enraged blow might be?

Thus Qu could only look on, filled with jealous hatred and vexation.

While everyone else was stunned, Yang Kai was overjoyed beyond measure.

He had been suppressing the Warm Spirit Lotus's pull for fear of creating too much noise, but now this indifferent man had drawn everyone's attention away and the whole pool had become tumultuous.

Even if Yang Kai caused a commotion now, it would be covered up.

He did not hesitate and released all suppression of the Warm Spirit Lotus, allowing it to absorb the golden-thread energy freely.

In an instant, torrents of golden light poured into the fiery red Sea of Consciousness. The golden radiance nearly drowned out the original crimson hue, and the energy contained within those lights was staggering. Even with Yang Kai’s abilities, he couldn’t refine or absorb it in time — all of it ended up being devoured by the Warm Spirit Lotus. The lotus became even more terrifying than the cold man’s body, able to accept and contain every thread of golden light without the slightest hindrance.

The golden brilliance in the Soul Cleansing Divine Water across the whole pool visibly dulled, yet the horrified and envious onlookers noticed nothing of the change.

Thus Yang Kai grew ever more wanton.

He felt some envy at the indifferent man's opportunity, but he was more broad-minded than anyone—Soul Techniques were merely ingenious applications of Divine Sense power, much like Martial Skills were clever uses of Saint Yuan, using minimal cost to unleash maximal force.

What of a Void King Realm Soul Technique? When his strength advanced in the future, Yang Kai believed he might even create a Soul Technique of his own.

What he was obtaining now was a fundamental root! Though the indifferent man's comprehension was extraordinary, compared with what Yang Kai was gaining it still fell far short.

If one eats meat, at least let others sip the broth—everyone has their own fate; jealousy is useless.

"Why has the color of this pool grown so pale?" a cry snapped everyone's attention back.

When they lowered their heads, their faces went deathly pale: in the space of a single tea's time the once-thick golden liquid had grown dull, with only scant golden light flowing within; the pool was no longer so viscous that one could even see the bottom with the naked eye, and Divine Sense could likewise penetrate the water.
