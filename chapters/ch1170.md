## Chapter 1170 — Forced Trade

Wei Guchang was actually quite a talkative man. As he and Yang Kai grew more familiar, their conversations broadened—from the distribution of the major powers on Dark Star to the famous promising youths—Wei Guchang spoke with confident detail, and Yang Kai gained a great deal from him.

He would, sometimes deliberately and sometimes not, try to steer the conversation toward the wider world, but whenever he did, Yang Kai would unobtrusively change the subject.

After a few such attempts, Wei Guchang politely stopped bringing it up.

Wei Guchang took Yang Kai’s silence for a reluctance to discuss the outside world, when in truth Yang Kai simply didn’t know much about it. Since entering the Star Domain he had only been to Shuiyue Star and Rainfall Star, and his contacts were almost entirely people from the Hengluo Commerce Guild; he had no real knowledge of the Star Domain’s power distribution or the local customs and geography, so he naturally wouldn’t chat about them with Wei Guchang.

Xuan’er’s temperament was calmer; most of the time she sat lost in thought, and occasionally a little girl’s contentment would show on her face, as if being held in Wei Guchang’s arms made anywhere they went acceptable.

After a day, Yang Kai clearly felt the air grow hot; the terrain they passed became increasingly barren, the ground covered in reddish-brown sand—an effect that grew worse the farther they flew.

The Flowing Flame Sandland spread across Dark Star, and that burning heat had long since affected the surrounding environment.

At one moment Yang Kai suddenly looked up toward the distance; all he could see was a sea of crimson. Far off, it seemed as if the very heavens and earth were red. Tremendous heat radiated from there, warping the air.

“That is the edge of the Flowing Flame Sandland,” Wei Guchang said, pointing toward the region where an undercurrent of dark red energy flowed like a curtain, his expression turning grave. “It looks like we still have some time—the Flowing Flame Sandland won’t open for a few more days.”

“Is there a way to tell?” Yang Kai asked.

“The change in the color of that energy curtain is the best sign. Only when it turns pale red can we pass through those entrances safely. Go in now, and anyone would die!” Wei Guchang took a light breath, a trace of fear flickering across his face.

They flew on for quite a while before the trio reached a point fifty li from the Flowing Flame Sandland’s outer edge. At that spot at least five hundred people had gathered; they were grouped into bands of varying size, each having found a decent place to sit and rest, conserving their strength. These were clearly warriors who had arrived early to wait for the sandland to open. When they saw Yang Kai and the other two arrive, they glanced in their direction.

Every one of them was of the Saint King Realm; the occasional Origin Returning Realm practitioners among them were simply elders leading their groups.

Farther ahead were scattered Origin Returning Realm experts stationed around the Flowing Flame Sandland’s perimeter, solemnly observing its changes.

This latter group were the most powerful people on Dark Star—each was at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Many of them had been watching this place for months or even half a year, so they could report the sandland’s developments back to their sects at the earliest moment and give their sects time to prepare.

Yingyue Hall had come late, as it was farther away; after the three of them descended they found an empty spot.

Wei Guchang looked off into the distance and said, “Brother Yang, wait here a moment. I’ll take my Junior Sister to find the Senior Uncles guarding this area and pay our respects — otherwise they’ll say we lack manners.”

“There’s no need to mind me, Brother Wei. Go on,” Yang Kai replied with a light nod.

Only then did Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan’er summon their Star Shuttle and fly off in a certain direction. In just a short while, their figures vanished from sight.

Yang Kai paid them no mind and instead looked around. The warriors gathered here came in groups; the smallest team had over twenty people, while some, like Yingyue Hall, had as many as fifty assembled together.

They watched Yang Kai with curiosity; many of them regarded him with contempt and disdain.

Yang Kai’s cultivation was too low, and because he had arrived with Wei Guchang and Xuan’er, it was easy for people to assume the three of them came from some minor clan—only small families would have but two or three slots to enter with Yingyue Hall.

After Yang Kai sat for a short time, two men strolled over and stood before him, looking down on him from above.

Yang Kai could see clearly that those two had come from a team of around thirty. To have thirty slots into the Flowing Flame Sandland meant their force wasn’t as great as Yingyue Hall, but it was by no means insignificant.

Not only them—many people from the other teams had stood up and were thinking of coming over, but these two had moved the fastest, forcing the rest to hold back and watch silently.

Why had they come to him? Yang Kai wondered.

The two men weren’t very old, perhaps in their thirties or forties — one was a Third-Stage Saint King, the other a First-Stage Saint King. They didn’t look like wicked men, but the one in the lead bore a crimson scar as long as a palm across his forehead, giving his face a rather fierce appearance.

“Friend.” The scarred man greeted him bluntly. “You’re heading into the Flowing Flame Sandland too?”

Although the question was ordinary, Yang Kai could clearly detect doubt and scorn in the man’s tone.

The man behind the scarred one stared at Yang Kai with a feverish gaze, as if Yang Kai had something he desired.

Yang Kai had no intention of engaging with them, but since he had come with Yingyue Hall, a conflict might make things difficult for Qian Tong; thinking that over, he forced himself to be patient and nodded, “Yes.”

The man smiled and said, “You’re not powerful—going in there will be dangerous.”

“That’s my business.” Yang Kai had a hunch what they were after. Qian Tong had mentioned that Flowing Flame Sandland slots could be transferred; these two were clearly after his slot.

The others who had stood were likely for the same reason; the scarred man had simply arrived first.

Sure enough, the scarred man shook his head. “I say this for your own good. Look, there are only three of you, and the man and woman seem close—once inside they’ll probably ignore you. Going in would be a near-suicide.”

He spoke in alarmist tones and wore an exaggerated expression, as if truly worried for Yang Kai’s safety. Seeing Yang Kai remain calm and show no sign of fear, he found it boring and said, “I have a deal—friend, interested?”

“Not interested.” Yang Kai refused immediately; since he knew their intention, he had no desire to waste words.

“Don’t be so quick to refuse.” The scarred man chuckled, crouched, and spoke low, “Look, you’re risking your life to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland; you might not come back. You’re going in to try to gain something, right? I have a way that will let you make some gains without risking your life.”

Saying that, he rummaged in his Spatial Ring and drew out a treasure, offering it to Yang Kai. “This is a lower-level Saint King-Grade secret treasure of decent quality. I’ll give it to you—refine it and your strength will surely rise. Of course I’m not giving it for free; all I want is your pass.”

“What pass?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

“The token that allows you to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland—don’t play dumb!” the First Stage Saint King Realm man who had been staring at Yang Kai shouted.

“There’s such a thing?” Yang Kai frowned; Wei Guchang had never mentioned any such token, and Qian Tong hadn’t handed him anything either.

Seeing Yang Kai’s confusion, the scarred man assumed he was feigning ignorance and sneered, “Don’t be shameless, friend. My Junior Brother only wants to go into the Flowing Flame Sandland with us. Sadly Qingque Gate doesn’t have enough slots; we’re just being generous taking a look at your slot. Besides, I’m not asking for your pass for nothing—didn’t I just give you a secret treasure?”

“A single Lower-Level Saint King-Grade treasure for my pass?” Yang Kai scoffed coldly. “Even if I had a pass, I wouldn’t sell it to you.”

“Are you refusing our courtesy? Let us see your Spatial Ring then.” The scarred man’s face darkened.

“You want to see my Spatial Ring? Do you have the ability?” Yang Kai’s expression turned cold.

A warrior’s Spatial Ring is a deeply private thing—no one could reasonably demand to see it. The scarred man’s words were a direct insult, and Yang Kai’s anger flared.

“Senior Brother, don’t fuss—just snatch it. He won’t dare do anything.” The First Stage Saint King man urged the scarred man, clearly eager to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Seeing the scarred man hesitate, he suddenly reached to seize Yang Kai’s Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai’s patience had reached its limit. Their constant prattling and the way they tried to make robbery look like a deal disgusted him. When the First Stage Saint King lunged, Yang Kai didn’t dodge—he reached out and grabbed back.

A mere First Stage Saint King could not evade Yang Kai’s attack; caught off-guard, he found his hand firmly seized.

In the astonishment that followed came the crisp snap of bones. He looked down at his arm and found it twisted as if braided; sharp pain surged through him and a scream of agony tore from his mouth, beads of sweat breaking out on his forehead.

“You dare!” The scarred man seemed only now to react. Seeing his Junior Brother so badly injured, he surged with Saint Yuan and threw a punch at Yang Kai’s face.

The punch was charged with mighty force and aimed at Yang Kai’s vital point; it was clearly meant to kill.

Yang Kai pulled the Junior Brother in front of him.

The scarred man didn’t have time to withdraw his full strength; his face changed as he was forced to pull back partway.

With a muffled thud the Junior Brother hit the ground, face pale and convulsing.
