## Chapter 2133 — Nameless Valley

"However, because of the appearance of the Star Seal, this time the Four Seasons Land will be much more dangerous than in previous years. So aside from searching for the Star Seal, the most important thing for you to remember is to ensure your own safety! You are all the future of the Sect. Losing any one of you is a loss to the Sect, so I want you all to make it out intact!"

"Yes, thank you Elder Gao for your concern!" the disciples responded in unison.

"Elder Gao, what exactly does the Star Seal look like?" Xiao Baiyi asked.

"The Star Seal... its shape and pattern are not fixed, but if you obtain it, it will be branded somewhere on your body, turning into a kind of mark. If you truly have the fortune to get one, you will naturally know."

"Understood!" Xiao Baiyi nodded.

"Additionally, the Star Seal can be transferred. After you bring it out, you can hand it over to the Sect! Of course, as a reward, anyone among you who obtains a Star Seal will be qualified to enter the Shattered Star Sea in the future!"

Upon hearing this, everyone’s breath caught, and they became extremely excited.

"Then... what if a disciple is lucky enough to obtain two or more?" Xiao Baiyi asked again.

Gao Xueting said, "Keep one for yourself, and hand the others over to the Sect. The Sect will give you corresponding rewards!"

At this point, she suddenly turned to look at Yang Kai and said, "You too!"

"Me?" Yang Kai looked surprised.

"That's right," Gao Xueting nodded. "Although you are not a disciple of Qingyang Shrine, since you have taken one of Qingyang Shrine's spots, you must also abide by our rules."

"Alright." Yang Kai nodded helplessly. He couldn’t go against the flow, and figured that when he came out of the Four Seasons Land, Qingyang Shrine would thoroughly inspect his body to see if he had obtained a Star Seal.

"That's all I needed to say. As for the rest... there's nothing more. Do as you see fit." With that, Gao Xueting returned to the bow of the ship and stood there in silence, like a statue, utterly still.

Outside the ship, Xia Sheng kept pace with the ship, looking pitiful as he called out. Judging by his appearance, he was probably begging for mercy.

But Gao Xueting didn’t even glance at him.

Xia Sheng, helpless, could only look toward Xiao Baiyi, seemingly hoping Xiao Baiyi would speak up for him.

Xiao Baiyi decisively turned his head the other way...

On the ship, Yang Kai frowned slightly, lost in thought.

He was considering whether to ask Gao Xueting for information about the Four Seasons Land.

But this woman seemed rather temperamental, and because of previous encounters, Yang Kai didn’t really want to interact with her, lest she see through him.

Just as he hesitated, he suddenly felt someone quietly poke him.

He turned to look and saw a young woman sitting not far beside him, pursing her red lips as she gazed at him.

The woman looked about twenty years old, though her real age was certainly more. She seemed tall, with fair skin and a charming appearance. Her long hair flowed gracefully.

"Miss, do you need something?" Yang Kai asked curiously.

"You don’t have this, right? Here, take it!" the woman said, handing Yang Kai a jade slip.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, reached out to take it, and swept his Divine Sense inside. After checking the contents recorded in the jade slip, he was overjoyed. "This is..."

The jade slip contained information about the Four Seasons Land.

Every time the Four Seasons Land opened, Qingyang Shrine would send disciples inside, so they were quite familiar with the place. The information in the jade slip included not only the locations of dangerous restrictions, but also the names and general strength classifications of various demonic beasts, and even a contour map.

He had just been considering whether to ask Gao Xueting for such information, but hesitated, only for someone to proactively give it to him.

Timely aid in the snow is worth far more than flowers on brocade, so Yang Kai’s goodwill toward this woman soared.

She probably guessed he didn’t have such a thing, so she quietly gave him a copy.

From this, it was clear the woman had a kind heart.

"Thank you, Miss. May I ask your name?" Yang Kai sincerely thanked her. Since she had done him a favor, he had to know her name.

"Murong Xiaoxiao!"

Yang Kai nodded, about to say more when Xiao Baiyi suddenly said, "Xiaoxiao, why are you chatting with an outsider?"

Murong Xiaoxiao stuck out her tongue at Yang Kai, but didn’t dare go against Xiao Baiyi’s wishes, so she fell silent.

Yang Kai said, "Miss, I’ll remember your kindness."

"It’s nothing!" Murong Xiaoxiao smiled slightly, not minding at all.

"Brother Xiao Bai!" Yang Kai turned to look at Xiao Baiyi.

"Who are you calling!" Xiao Baiyi’s face instantly turned cold.

"Brother Xiao..." Yang Kai corrected himself. "Although I’m not a disciple of Qingyang Shrine, since we’re all entering the Four Seasons Land together, that makes us companions..."

"Who’s your companion?" Xiao Baiyi sneered. "You stole Xue Yi’s spot. I’ll settle that with you sooner or later!"

"Brother Xiao, there’s no need for this... Who knows, maybe in the Four Seasons Land, you’ll need my help!"

"You?" Xiao Baiyi snorted coldly. "If there truly is something even I can't handle, your help would be of no use."

"If that’s how you see it... I have nothing more to say." Yang Kai smiled bitterly and shook his head.

It seemed Xiao Baiyi had truly taken a grudge against him, but that was understandable. He and Xue Yi were close, and Yang Kai had taken Xue Yi’s spot. As Senior Brother, he naturally wouldn’t show Yang Kai any kindness.

If he were friendly now, that would be truly suspicious.

It was only human nature.

Gao Xueting had no intention of interfering in the Dao Origin Realm experts’ exchanges, simply standing still and controlling the ship’s flight.

Five days passed.

On this day, a huge valley appeared ahead.

In the valley, crowds had gathered in groups, seemingly waiting for something.

From the crowd, the auras of several Emperor Realm experts could be felt.

Sensing this, Yang Kai’s expression changed, realizing they had arrived.

The information Qin Chaoyang had given him matched what Murong Xiaoxiao’s jade slip recorded: the entrance to the Four Seasons Land was in a nameless valley. Normally, the valley was unremarkable, with nothing special to attract attention, but before the Four Seasons Land opened, rich Spiritual Qi would gather, and when it reached a certain level, the secret realm entrance would open and remain for thirty-three days.

After thirty-three days, the entrance would close, and any cultivators still inside would be unable to leave.

The cultivators staying in the valley were those who had arrived early.

From this, Qingyang Shrine had arrived relatively late, as the best spots with the densest Spiritual Qi had already been taken.

The ship approached slowly, and the cultivators below clearly noticed, raising their heads to look. When they saw the Qingyang Shrine emblem on the ship, many faces grew serious.

After all, Qingyang Shrine was one of the top Sects in the entire Southern Territory. The ship alone represented authority and status.

From the jade slip’s information, Yang Kai learned that top Sects like Qingyang Shrine had twenty spots to enter the Four Seasons Land. Tianwu Sacred Land, Wuhua Hall, Ziyuan Commerce Guild, and Qiyao Commerce Guild had the same. As for the Southern Territory’s overlord, Star God Palace, it had forty spots—twice as many as Qingyang Shrine.

Sects ranked a bit lower had about ten spots each.

Some Sects had only three to five spots.

Yang Kai wasn’t sure how these spots were allocated, but it must have been carefully calculated and coordinated.

Judging by the four to five hundred people gathered below, there were quite a few Sects in the Southern Territory.

Gao Xueting stood at the bow, observed briefly, then found a place for the ship to land.

After the disciples disembarked, she put away the Secret Treasure.

"Rest here and recover your strength. Do not cause trouble. This Lord will go speak with the other elders about some matters." After saying that, she turned and left.

The others seemed to have expected this, so they weren’t surprised. Each took out prepared items from their Spatial Rings and set up tents.

"Huff..." Someone suddenly dropped from the sky, gasping for breath. Like a meteor from the heavens, he slammed into the ground, blasting a large crater into the earth.

Yang Kai looked closely and saw it was Xia Sheng, whom Gao Xueting had been deliberately ignoring!

He was impressive—he had chased the ship for five days straight on his Origin Qi and arrived nearly alongside the others.

Though he was a bit out of breath, he didn’t seem exhausted.

"Finally... made it!" Xia Sheng said weakly, looking resentfully at Xiao Baiyi. "Xiao Bai... you really aren’t being fair!"

Xiao Baiyi’s forehead twitched, but he chose to ignore him.

"Brother Yang, you didn’t speak up for me either! I had to fly here all by myself!" Xia Sheng, hands on his knees, rolled his eyes at Yang Kai. "You’re so cold to me—how are we supposed to conquer the world together in the future?"

Yang Kai said helplessly, "I’m just an outsider—this has nothing to do with me!"

"Ah, forget it, forget it. You people... really can’t be relied on!" Xia Sheng waved his hand and plopped down on the ground like a dying fish finally back in water, looking utterly content.

Yang Kai glanced at him, then ignored him, finding a quiet spot to sit cross-legged.

Clearly, there was still some time before the Four Seasons Land opened, and with so many experts gathered here, Yang Kai didn’t want to wander around and cause trouble. So he simply sat and rested among the Qingyang Shrine group.
