## Chapter 1700 — Sea Race

This was the law of Dark Star, the power of the heaven-and-earth principle, profound and unfathomable; even experts of the Void King Realm could not touch its edge. Although Yang Kai had become Star Lord, he still had no way to deal with this law.

He tried to break through it or disperse it, but he did not succeed.

With a deep sigh, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense and stopped wasting effort; although this layer of law restricted Dark Star cultivators from ascending to the Void King Realm, it did not pose a direct threat to the cultivators themselves, so there was no need to pay it too much heed.

Another day passed, and there was still no word from the Sea Hall!

This made Yang Kai a little impatient. Just as he was considering whether he should personally head to the Sea Hall’s main hall, his brow suddenly furrowed and his Divine Sense spread out.

Several thousand li from Xiaguang Island, a surge of towering waves rose, each a hundred zhang high, rapidly approaching Xiaguang Island; the waves joined sky and earth, their momentum immense. On those waves lifeforms strode the surf—figures flickering in number, at least a hundred in all.

Among those hundred or so were men and women. The men were hulking and not like humans; each stood four or five chi tall, their faces hideous and grim, chilling to behold. The women were all as lovely as the moon hiding behind flowers, fair-skinned and flawless, waists soft and boneless, some coquettish, some pure, some fiery—endlessly stirring the imagination.

What concerned Yang Kai was that this group were all experts at or above the Origin Returning Realm!

He had at first assumed they were masters from the Sea Hall, but upon closer inspection he found that was not the case.

These creatures were not human!

Yang Kai fell into thought and then suddenly remembered.

In the deep sea of Dark Star, humans were not the only flourishing race; there also existed a people called the Sea Race!

Sea Race was only a general name covering many branches; they were naturally adept at water-type techniques and martial skills, and in the deep sea they were titans among beings.

However, the Sea Race rarely interacted with humans, so cultivators living inland on Dark Star might never see a single member of the Sea Race in their lives; even human cultivators who lived in the deep sea seldom had the chance to encounter such beings.

Yang Kai sized them up for a while and found that these Sea Race members should include at least four or five branches: some had bodies covered in scales, some had long barbed tails like hooks, and some had arms shaped entirely like crab pincers, looking grotesque.

It was the first time he had seen members of the Sea Race, and he clicked his tongue in wonder. He could not tell what they intended by charging at Xiaguang Island with such force. After observing for some time, the hulking Sea Race leader stepping upon the towering wave seemed to perceive something; his eyes flashed with terrifying light as he gazed into the void, as if trying to locate Yang Kai’s hiding place.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and withdrew his gaze.

To him, no one on Dark Star was worth his attention. These hundred or so Sea Race cultivators above the Origin Returning Realm might be considered a formidable force for Sea Hall — but in his eyes, they were hardly worth mentioning.

On top of the great wave the hulking Sea Race member frowned, glanced at the void with some thought, his face full of suspicion.

“Shang Ao, did you sense something?” a scantily clad woman beside him frowned as she asked.

Shang Ao slowly shook his head. “It seemed someone was watching us, but there were no obvious signs. Perhaps I sensed wrongly.”

The woman was stunned; she knew Shang Ao’s strength. As one of the leaders of the Sea God Palace, he was a notable expert across Dark Star and seldom erred in his senses.

But since Shang Ao said so, she did not press the matter. Her brows knit beautifully in worry. “This time it will be difficult. The princess disappeared near Xiaguang Island; although there is a high chance she was kidnapped by humans, what if the other side refuses to admit it?”

Shang Ao snorted coldly. “If they dare to deny it, I will raze Xiaguang Island to the ground! These humans should have been expelled from the Wuyou Sea long ago; this is our Sea Race’s territory!”

The woman sighed deeply, her face full of concern. She gazed toward the location of Xiaguang Island and silently prayed that their princess had indeed been taken by humans; otherwise they would have no direction to search. This assault on Xiaguang Island was a desperate gamble—if it were not for being utterly cornered, the Sea Hall would not dare so easily to open hostilities against the Sea God Palace.

But Shang Ao seemed certain the princess had been taken by humans, and this trip would likely not end peacefully. If they could retrieve the princess it would be best; if not, a great war between the two deep-sea peoples would be inevitable.

The waves surged with incredible speed, advancing a hundred li in an instant.

When the waves drew to within about a thousand li of Xiaguang Island, Pang Zhen and the others sensed the disturbance in the heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi and rushed from their residences to look toward the distance.

After a moment, Pang Zhen’s face changed drastically. “These arrogant Sea Race dare attack Xiaguang Island—activate the defensive formation!”

At his command Xiaguang Island immediately hummed; soon the great island was shrouded by a layer of transparent energy. The island’s cultivators all mobilized and gathered around Pang Zhen, standing solemn and grave.

Yang Kai, who did not know what had happened, was naturally curious and came to stand beside Pang Zhen.

“Sect Master Yang, the Sea Race have come to make trouble; I ask you to stand aside,” Pang Zhen gently advised. Yang Kai’s earlier proposal had suited him well; whether Yang Kai could attain a higher position within the Sea Hall depended on whether that proposal would succeed, so Pang Zhen was concerned for Yang Kai and feared he might be implicated.

“No matter, Island Lord Pang, I’ll just take a look,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Seeing this, Pang Zhen thought for a moment and ceased his persuasion; after all, Yang Kai had already proven his strength.

“Why are the Sea Race so aggressive? Has Xiaguang Island or the Sea Hall provoked them?” Yang Kai asked casually.

Pang Zhen shook his head. “I do not know, but the Sea Hall and the Sea Race’s Sea God Palace are not exactly at peace. Living together in the deep sea, friction is inevitable. Still, I have never seen a situation like today. There were covenants between our Sea Hall and the Sea God Palace; they would not lightly send so many experts to attack the other side.”

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered a few times as he casually asked, “The Sea God Palace must be able to gather many deep-sea cultivation resources, right?”

Pang Zhen was wholly focused on guessing why the Sea Race had mobilized so many experts and did not ponder Yang Kai’s words deeply; he said, “They have natural advantages and can gather resources from the deepest parts of the sea that our Sea Hall cannot match.”

As soon as he had spoken, Pang Zhen realized and glanced at Yang Kai, seeing him smiling contentedly. He straightened his expression and warned, “Sect Master Yang, beings of different races think differently. The Sea Race are not easy to get along with. If you intend to trade cultivation resources with them, it will likely be difficult; the Sea Race have always looked down on humans. You, having lived inland for long, may not understand this.”

“Thanks for the reminder, Island Lord Pang,” Yang Kai replied lightly.

Pang Zhen naturally knew what Yang Kai was aiming for and why he thought so.

Yang Kai had waited here for several days and no one from the main hall had come to negotiate resource trade with him. Anyone would have grievances under such treatment. If the Sea Hall dominated the deep sea alone, it would be simpler, for Yang Kai had no other choice but the Sea Hall and could only wait patiently. But now with the appearance of the Sea God Palace, Pang Zhen knew Yang Kai had set his sights on the Sea God Palace.

If Yang Kai could connect with the Sea God Palace, whether the Sea Hall existed would be of no consequence.

If he lost this merit, Pang Zhen would find it difficult to advance and would be stuck as the island’s lord of Xiaguang Island for life—comfortable, perhaps, but still far from the true center of power.

Seeing Yang Kai did not take his words to heart, Pang Zhen felt some resentment; his anger was not toward Yang Kai so much as at the main hall’s attitude.

But for now he had no time to think of these things; while he and Yang Kai were talking, the towering wave had already reached within a few li of Xiaguang Island and crashed on without stopping.

Rumbling roared……

The array and restrictions of Xiaguang Island trembled and had nearly been broken.

After a long while the great wave subsided, sweeping over Xiaguang Island and then vanishing.

Pang Zhen looked up angrily at the sky and shouted, “Shang Ao, what do you mean by this—does the Sea God Palace intend to go to war with my Sea Hall?”

“Pang Zhen! Hand the person over, or I’ll turn your Xiaguang Island into a wasteland — no bird will fly, no grass will grow!” Shang Ao roared, his voice booming like thunder, making everyone’s eardrums ache.

Pang Zhen was stunned. “Hand over who?”

He had no idea what Shang Ao was talking about and felt baffled.

“Do not play dumb. I give you the time of a cup of tea; if you do not show me the person I want to see, then prepare to die!” Shang Ao’s strength was great, but he was simple-minded and once fixed on something he would not be swayed.

He was convinced the person he sought was on Xiaguang Island.

Such arrogance enraged Pang Zhen. He laughed coldly. “Even if I knew who you meant, I would not hand them over to you.”

Pang Zhen was, after all, a master of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and the lord of an island. For Shang Ao to come stirring up trouble without cause — even daring to threaten him — naturally, Pang Zhen would not back down.

“Good! You said it yourself — don’t blame me for showing no mercy, then!” A fierce light flashed across Shang Ao’s face as he was about to unleash slaughter, when suddenly, the scantily dressed woman beside him grabbed his arm and said, “Wait!”

Though Shang Ao’s face darkened with displeasure, he still gave her that much face. Hovering in midair, he glared down with anger written across his features and disdain gleaming in his eyes.

He seemed to look down on everyone and did not even regard Pang Zhen as worthy of note. Yet upon seeing Yang Kai his gaze narrowed in puzzlement.

Yang Kai, smiling as if harmless and utterly innocent, gave him an unexpectedly dangerous feeling.

This made Shang Ao look at Yang Kai a few more times.
