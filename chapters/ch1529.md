## Chapter 1529 — Xuan Realm Pearl

"Spatial Force is an obscure, esoteric branch, exceedingly difficult to cultivate. I am no genius; over these decades I have gained some understanding, but by no means can I do what Sect Master Yang can—condense spatial power into a blade, or tear open the void with a bare hand! Sect Master Yang's miraculous methods, I bow before them! I beg Sect Master Yang not to be stingy with instruction and to dispel many of the doubts in my heart."

"You understand Spatial Force too?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Only superficially." Qi Tianche nodded humbly. "I shut myself away for decades to study Spatial Force; I did gain something, yet..."

Yang Kai was stunned.

He had not expected the old fellow to spend decades in seclusion for the sake of studying spatial power.

Previously Yang Xiuzhu even warned Senior Sister Ye Xijun to be careful, saying Qi Tianche had retreated to cultivate a secret art for decades and might not be ordinary. It turned out he was cultivating Spatial Force.

But why would that old man do such a thing?

Yang Kai’s thoughts spun. Suddenly a flash of insight lit his mind and he looked at Qi Tianche with a half-smile. He said calmly, "Elder, if I am not mistaken, you studied Spatial Force for the sake of this Small Xuan Realm and that bead, right?"

"Oh? And what leads you to say that?" Qi Tianche’s eyes narrowed, a bright gleam appearing in them, as if he were intrigued.

"Heh." Yang Kai let out a laugh. "I failed to see the Void Passage and inexplicably was brought here by you; thinking it through, that bead should be the key to opening this Small Xuan Realm, and to use the bead one would likely need to master Spatial Force, so that must be why you cultivated it. I hope I am not wrong."

"Correct!" Qi Tianche looked at Yang Kai approvingly and nodded. "I wonder what else Sect Master Yang perceived?"

"I also see this Small Xuan Realm is incomplete. Perhaps your comprehension of Spatial Force is insufficient; to make it whole you must become more proficient with spatial power..." As he spoke, Yang Kai frowned. He suddenly felt confused, unsure of the concrete relationship between Qi Tianche’s mastery of spatial power and this Small Xuan Realm.

A Small Xuan Realm is a Small Xuan Realm—its own parcel of heaven and earth; it should have nothing inherently to do with any one person.

"Sect Master Yang's gaze is like a torch—old man admires it!" Qi Tianche bowed slightly. "Though Sect Master Yang is right on most points, there is one matter you spoke wrongly about."

"Which matter?" Yang Kai watched him suspiciously.

"That bead is not the key to the Small Xuan Realm!" Qi Tianche smiled faintly. "That bead itself is the Small Xuan Realm!"

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai frowned and stared at him.

"Put it this way—the bead contains within it a sealed Small Xuan Realm!" Qi Tianche added.

"What?" Yang Kai’s heart jolted; even Fang Peng stood by, gaping.

"A Small Xuan Realm sealed inside a bead? Is that possible?" Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly in disbelief. But soon his expression grew grave. Looking at Qi Tianche with a darkened visage, he hesitated, then asked, "Could that bead... be an Imperial Treasure?"

Qi Tianche laughed, lightly clapping his hands, and nodded. "Sect Master Yang is indeed unparalleled in cleverness; you quickly grasped the crux. Indeed, that bead is an Imperial Treasure! An ordinary Secret Treasure could never possess such a wondrous function, but Imperial Treasures are different—their mysteries are beyond our speculation! That bead is indeed one of the two Imperial Treasure pearls, the Xuan Realm Pearl!"

"The second of the Imperial Treasure pearls!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "Then the other must be the Extinction Thunder Bead?"

"Yes. These two items were passed down from the Great Emperor and are the most important treasures of our Star Emperor Mountain!" Qi Tianche admitted, then smiled. "Do not blame Senior Sister Ye for not warning you—she simply did not know I could refine the Xuan Realm Pearl. This thing has been passed down within Star Emperor Mountain for tens of thousands of years, yet no head of Star Emperor Mountain in all those generations could refine it! With time even the precise function of the Xuan Realm Pearl became unknown. I was fortuitous to refine it and discern its secrets."

Yang Kai’s face went ashen; his expression turned ugly.

Had he not truly been inside this fractured Small Xuan Realm, he might never have believed the world contained such an absurd Secret Treasure that could seal an entire realm within itself.

Now he was trapped inside, and even his Dragon Bone Sword was left outside—how could he resist? That old fellow even possessed a Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel, a Void King‑Grade Secret Treasure.

"Sect Master Yang, do not think of trying to rip open space. The Small Xuan Realm is its own parcel of heaven and earth with its own laws; tearing space here will be of no use," Qi Tianche seemed kindly and warned.

"We’ll see if it’s useless—if you don’t mind?" Yang Kai looked up at Qi Tianche.

"Please, Sect Master Yang. I would very much like to test your mastery over Spatial Force," Qi Tianche gestured, showing no intention to stop him.

Yang Kai didn’t hesitate. He slashed his hand through the air and an immediate spatial rift opened.

But before he could step into it, Qi Tianche suddenly waved his hand and the rift vanished.

Yang Kai shot him a cold look, clearly displeased.

Qi Tianche smiled. "The laws of this Small Xuan Realm are now under my control; Sect Master Yang should give up that notion."

“Old bastard!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“Sect Master Yang, you’re young and impetuous — I won’t hold it against you,” the old man said evenly. “I’ve already spoken plainly; now it’s time for you to make your choice. If you’re willing to serve under me, I’ll treat you as a friend from this day forth. But if Sect Master Yang insists on being obstinate… hmph, then I’ll have no choice but to resort to certain measures. I’ve given you the chance — whether you can seize it depends on your own actions.”

Yang Kai grinned broadly. “You think trapping me here means you can do as you please? Working with you? Senior, don’t delude yourself. If you want to cultivate Spatial Power—try again in your next life!”

At that moment, as if on command, the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird that had been circling above Yang Kai cried out loudly, turning into a ball of flame and lunging at Qi Tianche.

"Ai!" Qi Tianche sighed deeply. "If Sect Master Yang persists, then this old man can only use force. If I offend you, please forgive me!"

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and pointed a finger at the Fire Bird that rushed toward him.

A strange scene unfolded.

A vortex suddenly appeared in the sky, spinning as if producing boundless suction, drawing the Fire Bird in; no matter how the Artifact Spirit struggled it could not escape.

In just three breaths’ time the Fire Bird dove into the vortex and vanished.

The mental link between Yang Kai and the Fire Bird was severed, and Yang Kai’s face turned leaden at the outcome.

"Do not worry, Sect Master Yang. I merely banished it outside so it would not interfere with our duel," Qi Tianche smiled faintly. Then his face grew extremely solemn; he roared and stamped one foot hard on the ground.

The earth trembled slightly; the sound of brocade tearing rang out as Qi Tianche’s robe split apart, flinging fabric outward and revealing his torso.

Yang Kai looked over and showed an expression of shock.

The old man appeared aged and lean, but his body was exceptionally well-built.

Muscle layers were distinct, each ridge bulging, bursting with raw power.

Such a physique would be common for a youth, but for an old man whose hair had grayed and who wore three long whiskers, it was bewildering.

His physical body was actually this formidable! The explosive power contained within each of those muscles was enough to make anyone stare in awe.

Saint Yuan surged inside him, Qi Tianche’s aura was peerless, and faint light shimmered from the exposed skin.

Yang Kai and Fang Peng both stood dumbstruck.

"Sect Master Yang, I’ll give you one last chance. Turn back now and there is still time; otherwise I will not hold back. If I wound you I will feel remorse," Qi Tianche looked at Yang Kai with imposing gravity and spoke low.

“Enough nonsense. You dragged me into this cramped space just to show off the advantage of that body of yours, didn’t you?” Yang Kai smiled oddly. “Go on then—let’s see if you can actually pull it off!”

Seeing him refuse his goodwill again and again, Qi Tianche’s expression turned sinister. He nodded and said, “Very well. In that case, don’t blame this old man for showing no mercy.”

With that, Qi Tianche blurred from sight and reappeared above Yang Kai’s head. He did not display any secret art nor unleash a Secret Treasure.

He merely swung a single fist and struck down at Yang Kai with tremendous force.

In such a confined space, any Secret Treasure or technique is severely limited; the one with a powerful body unquestionably held the advantage!

Silent and soundless—yet the power contained within that single fist was enough to shatter a mountain peak.

Yang Kai stood there as if oblivious to the imminent peril.

Qi Tianche frowned, uncertain what trick he intended to play.

Only when the fist’s wind swept his face did Yang Kai suddenly roar, "Out!"

A small figure bizarrely manifested before Yang Kai. In one instant it swelled, and in the blink of an eye became a stone giant several zhang tall.

The Stone Puppet!

His Dragon Bone Sword remained outside and the Fire Bird had been banished, but Yang Kai still had the Stone Puppet!

The Stone Puppet bore on its shoulder the pitch‑black Heaven‑Shaking Pillar, which grew as it surged; the secret treasure, like a staff, expanded with it.

Gripping the Heaven‑Shaking Pillar, it swept forward with a tremendous arc.

Qi Tianche’s eyes narrowed; horror and disbelief showed across his face as he hastily retreated.

From that blow he sensed a mortal threat—seemingly even his strong body would be unable to withstand such a strike.

Boom...

Space itself seemed to collapse from the impact; Qi Tianche felt a numbness in his abdomen.

He was not directly struck by the black staff, only brushed by the afterwind, yet even so his chest’s qi and blood surged and his breathing grew labored—one could imagine what would have happened had it hit true.

His face contorted, and while explosively retreating he did not hesitate, stretching out a hand to point at the Stone Puppet.

He intended to banish the Stone Puppet from this space as well!
