## Chapter 1898 — You are that Yang Kai?

My heavens! How could this possibly happen!

What on earth had those two been doing inside? How could Third Brother, that devil among mortals, behave in such a bizarre way? Shen Tu even thought he glimpsed a kind of seductive charm in Xue Yue's eyes!

Deep within, Shen Tu howled in anguish, and the look he cast at Yang Kai had changed its flavor entirely.

Beside them, Li Nuo and Chun Yi stood stupefied, utterly at a loss for words.

Xue Yue obviously understood that the three of them had to be mistaken; the coyness at the corner of her eyes was even more apparent, and her gaze flickered about with the guilty look of someone caught stealing.

"Brother Shen Tu, I will accompany Xue Yue to Shuitian City."

"Oh…" Shen Tu responded mechanically, not even hearing clearly what Yang Kai had said.

"Then I'll take my leave." Yang Kai smiled faintly and cupped his fist. "I'll be leaving the matters with the Five Directions Commerce Guild to Brother Shen Tu — please take care of them for me."

Having said that, he signaled Xue Yue; the two immediately produced their Star Shuttles and ascended into the sky.

Only after their figures vanished did Shen Tu and the others suddenly come to their senses.

Shen Tu slapped his thigh and wailed, face contorted: "It's over, it's over — how could Third Brother be so shameless, how could he do such a thing… and Brother Yang, ah…"

He wore an expression of grief and regret for the two of them.

Chun Yi and Li Nuo wore the same faces.

"Now I'm ruined too." Shen Tu moaned, clutching his head and squatting on the ground with no dignity.

"Second Young Master, what has this got to do with you?" Li Nuo asked, curious as she looked at him.

"Brother Yang is someone I brought here. If I'd known he had such a habit and was close to Third Brother, I would never — not in a million years — have brought him to Shuiyue Star. Now look, Father has been hoping Third Brother and I would marry soon to continue the family line. Seeing Third Brother like that, how could there be any heir… will I have to shoulder that burden alone?" Shen Tu complained, showing the weight of a mountain on his shoulders.

Li Nuo pursed her lips and smiled: "As a son, continuing the line is hardly an unnatural duty. Second Young Master, why are you worrying over it?"

Shen Tu slowly lifted his head and regarded Li Nuo seriously. Suddenly he said, "Then why don't you bear me a child!"

Li Nuo's face flushed. She shot Shen Tu a reproachful glance and hurried away in quick, dainty steps.

Shen Tu's shouting followed from behind: "Will you agree or not? At least give me an answer — why run off!"

Chun Yi shook her head repeatedly at the side, utterly helpless.

…

Shuitian City — the busiest and most prosperous city on Shuiyue Star, where Spiritual Qi was most concentrated. Any martial artist wishing to enter had to pay a considerable toll of Saint Crystal as passage money, and to remain in the city one had to pay a corresponding amount of Saint Crystal.

Within the city, all manner of residences had been established for martial artists to rent.

The whole of Shuitian City was practically a money-making machine, generating vast amounts of Saint Crystals every single day.

Xue Yue escorted Yang Kai into Shuitian City without needing to show identification; the gate guards respectfully let them pass while curiously scrutinizing Yang Kai, wondering at his background that allowed him to walk beside the famed Third Young Master Xue Yue.

Wherever Xue Yue passed, women shrieked and gathered, eyes full of infatuation; some brazen women in revealing clothes flirted and batted their eyelashes, though most watched shyly with the bloom of first love.

Even some men showed a captivated expression, quietly gazing at her.

The head-turn rate reached a terrifying ninety percent.

Xue Yue seemed accustomed to it; after signaling Yang Kai, she shot upward and sped toward the city center.

Yang Kai held back a laugh and followed after her.

No sooner had they gone than a fellow rushed to the street center holding several scroll paintings and shouted, "Portraits of the Third Young Master for sale, painted by a famed artist, life-sized and indistinguishable from the real man — with one you may face the Third Young Master day and night; one thousand Saint Crystals per piece, get them while they last!"

As he spoke, he unfurled one of the scrolls with a hand.

On the scroll was a face of noble jade, handsome and refined, holding a folding fan, dressed in white like polished jade, long hair black as ink — who else could it be but Xue Yue? The painted Xue Yue smiled faintly, as if smiling directly at the onlookers.

In an instant countless women surged forward, hemming the seller in on all sides; among them were even some men.

"Give me one!"

"I'll take two!"

"Quick, money first, goods second — here's one thousand Saint Crystal!"

"Wah, give me one please, my wife said if I don't buy one this time she won't let me back in the house — wah, Third Young Master, I hate you!"

"Damn it, if anyone touches my chest, step forward and admit it — are you brave enough to do it but not brave enough to admit it?"

"Quiet! I'll take all of these portraits!" A thick, bearded man shoved everyone aside, producing a Spatial Ring for the seller and stuffing it full of the remaining portraits, eyes sweeping the crowd with domineering arrogance as he snorted: "You lot of ordinary fans, how could you be worthy of the Third Young Master? Only a peerless hero like me deserves him!"

"Ugh…"

High in the sky, Xue Yue stumbled and nearly fell headlong.

Though she had flown a fair distance away, with her cultivation level she could clearly hear the commotion, and an involuntary chill ran over her skin.

Yang Kai looked at her with curiosity: "Does your appearance always cause this sort of ruckus?"

"More or less." Xue Yue wore an expression of helplessness. "That's why I usually don't show myself in public."

As she spoke she cast Yang Kai a sidelong look: "Is it funny?"

"I'm not laughing!" Yang Kai replied solemnly.

"Hmph! If you dare laugh out loud, I'll give you a lesson!"

"I'm really not laughing… wahahaha!"

Crunch, crunch…

Xue Yue's silver teeth nearly shattered in her bite.

At the very center of Shuitian City, Spiritual Qi swirled, thick as substance, almost to the degree of condensing into threads.

There stood a towering palace complex — the heart of the entire Hengluo Commerce Guild, the center of power and of wealth.

In the northwest corner of the palace complex, in a certain hall, a burly, lion-like man paced anxiously, frowning and glancing out repeatedly as if awaiting someone.

His anxiety was written on his face; his brows were knitted as if they would never unbind.

Others in the hall wore garb marking them as Origin-Grade alchemists and the like, all long-respected figures.

Yet not one among those alchemists dared speak, fearful of angering the burly man.

For this man was the master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild — Chairman Ai Ou!

Even as Origin-Grade alchemists were noble, they could not stand above the guild's master; besides, they felt impotent about the matter of the woman in the hall and were embarrassed, so they did not speak up.

Ai Ou was broad-shouldered and powerful, his massive frame exuding pressure; now he was irritable and the Saint Yuan of his Second Stage of the Void King Realm fluctuated from him, making many alchemists groan but none daring to remark.

Ai Ou halted his pacing and his eyes flashed as he peered outside.

In the next moment his face brightened; he strode forward and said eagerly, "Is Master Zuo De here?"

Two long rainbows fell and revealed two figures before the hall — Xue Yue and Yang Kai.

Hearing Ai Ou's words, Yang Kai instinctively glanced back, finding no one behind him; Xue Yue, however, caught the meaning and hurried to explain, "Father, it's not Master Zuo De."

"Not Master Zuo De!" Ai Ou's expression darkened as his gaze swept coldly over Yang Kai, then he shouted at Xue Yue in anger, "If it's not Master Zuo De, why did you bring him here? Do you know what kind of place this is?"

Scolded headlong, Xue Yue dared not retort and bowed her head to apologize: "Sorry, Father, but my friend is also an alchemist, so…"

"An alchemist!" Ai Ou's face cleared slightly as he reexamined Yang Kai; when he perceived Yang Kai's cultivation he was struck with alarm: "Second Stage of the Void King Realm!"

Only then did he realize Yang Kai's cultivation matched his own.

He looked again in disbelief to confirm he had not been mistaken, then asked suspiciously, "Yue'er, when did you acquire a friend like this?"

He found Yang Kai's visage unfamiliar; though Xue Yue had decent aptitude, she had only reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and thus could not possibly know someone from the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, which made him curious.

"He's Yang Kai I told you about!" Xue Yue answered softly, watching Ai Ou's expression change.

"Junior Yang Kai greets Chairman Ai Ou!" Yang Kai cupped his fist politely, greeting him indifferently.

Though annoyed that Xue Yue had been unfairly scolded, Yang Kai maintained proper decorum since he stood before Xue Yue and Shen Tu's father.

"Yang Kai?" Ai Ou furrowed his brow and suddenly seemed to recall something, whispering, "You are that Yang Kai?"

"It seems Chairman Ai Ou knows of me." Yang Kai frowned slightly; the look on Ai Ou's face felt off.

"I know you — very well!" Ai Ou replied in a deep voice, and at once Saint Yuan burst forth as he thrust a hand out, reaching to seize Yang Kai.

From his posture it seemed he intended to capture Yang Kai alive!

"Father!" Xue Yue's face changed entirely, not understanding why her father would strike at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face turned cold; he shoved Xue Yue aside and struck with a palm suffused with Saint Yuan, swirling like nebulae and containing an overwhelming force.

"Boom…"

A tremendous sound resounded through the hall as the powers of the two Second Stage Void King cultivators collided in the void, whipping up winds and sweeping all around.

After a short while the dust settled; Yang Kai had been forced back three steps, Ai Ou two.

In that exchange Ai Ou had taken a small advantage.
