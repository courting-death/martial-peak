## Chapter 2145 — Fickle and Faithless

Zhou An remained motionless, entirely because of Yang Kai.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense enveloped the space above his head, like a sharp blade hanging upside down, making him feel as if the slightest movement would see him torn to pieces.

This left his face pale, his heart filled with deep fear and unease.

He could sense that Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was as powerful as that of someone at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, far surpassing his own. To fight such a person would bring him no benefit at all.

Looking at the battlefield, both Huagu and Xiong Ning seemed to be at a disadvantage.

Bitterness welled up in his heart; he knew this time he was in serious trouble.

He snuck a glance at Yang Kai and found that Yang Kai wasn’t paying him any attention. Zhou An’s heart stirred, and he forced a smile, cupping his fists, “Friend..."

Hearing this, Yang Kai turned to look at him and said indifferently, “Any last words?”

Zhou An’s mouth twitched. Awkwardly, he said, “Friend, you misunderstand. I don’t know those two at all. We just happened to meet and traveled together by chance!”

Yang Kai gazed at him coldly, unmoved.

Instead, the other two were shocked by his words.

Xiong Ning, dodging Liu Yan’s deadly attacks, looked at Zhou An in disbelief and said, “Senior Brother Zhou, what are you saying?”

Hua An was also furious, shouting, “Zhou An, even now you want to wash your hands of this? Hurry up and fight!”

“He’s calling you Senior Brother...” Yang Kai said, glancing at Xiong Ning.

Zhou An straightened his face, “He’s got a problem with his head, friend, don’t listen to his nonsense.” As he spoke, he put on a fawning smile and said to Yang Kai, “Friend, I truly mean you no harm. I was only dragged along by that man and had to come investigate. Just now, when I attacked your Artifact Spirit, it was out of necessity. Fortunately, your Artifact Spirit wasn’t harmed. That’s a small blessing in misfortune. I hope you can be magnanimous and not hold it against me!”

He had barely finished spewing those shameless words—before Yang Kai could even respond—when Huagu’s face flushed a furious crimson. He nearly spat blood on the spot, veins bulging as he leapt to his feet, hair bristling with rage. “You despicable cur, have you no shame at all?”

“Shut up!” Zhou An suddenly shouted righteously, “From now on, I, Zhou, have nothing to do with you!”

“Waaah!” Huagu was nearly driven mad, letting out a strange cry. In his moment of distraction, the Incarnation caught a flaw. The Incarnation stomped a single foot on the ground and shouted, “Draw a prison with the earth!”

A strange power surged from that massive body. The ground suddenly began to flow like liquid, and from the shifting earth, long hands emerged, whipping through the air like lashes.

Caught off guard, Huagu was immediately entangled by these long whips.

“Not good!” Huagu cried out. Just as he tried to break free, a tremendous force pulled him from below, dragging him uncontrollably into the earth, leaving only his head exposed.

Strangely, the moment Huagu sank into the ground, the earth returned to normal, becoming as solid as iron. No matter how he struggled, he couldn’t break free.

He was like a man trapped in a quagmire, with no way forward or back, completely restrained.

The Incarnation’s massive body stood before him like a mountain, blocking out all light...

“Oh? A new divine ability?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, surprised.

He remembered that the Incarnation couldn’t use this secret technique before. He didn’t know if it was self-taught, a talent of the Stone Puppet clan, or thanks to the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

Meanwhile, Zhou An’s legs were trembling.

Seeing that even Huagu, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, had been defeated so quickly, how could he dare stay any longer?

He quickly cupped his fists, “That’s all I have to say. I’ll take my leave!”

With that, he tried to slip away and save his own skin.

“Did I say you could leave?” Yang Kai waved his hand, and a Moon Blade slashed down in front of him.

Zhou An halted mid-step, turned back with a forced smile, and said, “Then… may I ask if Friend has any further instructions?”

Though he put on a submissive face, there was still a wary glint in his eyes. Yang Kai had no doubt that if he attacked, Zhou An would fight back instantly.

A man who could so easily betray his own Senior Brothers was unlikely to trust anyone.

“I wouldn’t call it an instruction...” Yang Kai said coolly, “But since you claim you’re not with them, you should do something to prove it, right?”

“Do something...” Zhou An’s eyes flickered, but he quickly nodded, “Understood. Friend, just watch!”

With that, he summoned his long spear Secret Treasure, poured Origin Qi into it, Law Power swirling around, and leapt toward the battle between Liu Yan and Xiong Ning, the spear tip bursting with a ring of light.

“Mixed Yuan Divine Spear!”

He shouted, eyes full of killing intent, aiming straight at Xiong Ning!

Xiong Ning was terrified.

Under Liu Yan’s assault, he was already struggling. Zhou An’s shameless betrayal had shaken his heart, and now, as Zhou An’s spear suddenly struck, he instantly sensed death.

After barely blocking Liu Yan’s attack, Xiong Ning shouted, “Senior Brother Zhou, are you crazy?”

Zhou An snorted coldly, said nothing, and his spear suddenly paused, pulled back, then thrust forward again.

That terrifying attack, just a hair’s breadth from Xiong Ning, suddenly changed direction and blasted toward Liu Yan.

“I knew you’d do that!” Liu Yan, though startled, remained calm. With a cold snort, she opened her mouth, unleashing a pillar of fire mixed with wild lightning.

Boom...

A massive burst of light engulfed the three on the battlefield, lingering for a long time.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai’s lips curled in a mocking smile.

He clearly saw that after Zhou An’s feint, he immediately used a secret technique, burning his Essence-Blood. His whole body glowed crimson, shrouded in a blood mist, and he fled into the depths of the canyon at incredible speed!

“Fickle and faithless—what a wretch.” Yang Kai even offered a word of praise.

If he were in Zhou An’s position, he doubted he could have done better to survive.

But this feint not only distracted Liu Yan, it also fooled Xiong Ning. After the attack, Xiong Ning was left dumbfounded. He thought he was dead for sure, but when he realized he was unharmed, Liu Yan pounced on him again...

He could only grit his teeth and keep fighting.

Deep in the canyon, Zhou An fled desperately.

After seeing Huagu get restrained, he knew if he didn’t run now, he’d be dead for sure. Never mind that strange Stone Giant—just the young man at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was more than he could handle.

He’d never seen such a thing before: a First Stage Dao Origin cultivator whose Divine Sense was as strong as a Third Stage!

As the saying goes, a wise man submits to circumstances. Zhou An had always been flexible, skilled at navigating sect politics and relationships.

This blood-burning technique cost him dearly, but it could boost his speed by half for a short time. He was confident that no matter how strong Yang Kai was, he couldn’t catch up.

However...

Just as this thought crossed his mind, ripples appeared in the void ahead. Clear spatial power fluctuations surged from there.

Zhou An was stunned, suspiciously looking forward.

He saw... a figure slowly step out of the void, eyes fixed on him with a mocking gaze.

“You...” Zhou An’s eyes widened in disbelief at Yang Kai, exclaiming, “How is this possible?”

But he was knowledgeable enough to quickly connect the dots, exclaiming in horror, “Spatial divine ability?”

This scene could only be explained by the legendary instant movement secret technique of a cultivator who had mastered Spatial Force!

Although some special Secret Treasures could also pierce the void and do similar things, Zhou An hadn’t seen any sign of Yang Kai using such a treasure.

He immediately understood—this man had truly mastered Spatial Force!

Realizing this, Zhou An’s face turned ashen.

Anyone with a brain wouldn’t try to run from someone skilled in Spatial Force. It was pointless!

In that instant, Zhou An tasted utter bitterness. He opened his mouth, as if to say something.

Yang Kai cut him off, “Whatever you say, I’ll just take it as nonsense!”

With that, Yang Kai waved his hand, and dozens of Moon Blades shot out in a frenzy.

Zhou An’s heart sank. He spun his spear in front of him, forming an impenetrable defense.

Clangs rang out as the Moon Blades were blocked, but Zhou An was forced to retreat again and again.

Before he could steady himself, Yang Kai suddenly vanished.

Zhou An was shocked, hurriedly releasing his Divine Sense, but couldn’t sense Yang Kai anywhere.

Instinctively, he thrust his spear behind him, but struck only empty air—no one was there.

A chilling voice sounded behind his head, like death’s summons: “Myriad Sword radiance, chasing the moon and devouring the wolf!”

Terrifying sword intent filled the air. Endless sword light slashed down, turning the dark canyon as bright as day!

In that instant, Zhou An moved as though heaven itself lent him a hand.

He shouted, fighting back with all his might, pouring all his Origin Qi into his spear. Thousands of spear shadows appeared, his momentum soaring!

Violent energy exploded in the void, the ultimate moves clashing in all directions. Muffled groans rang out, blood splattered...

When the dazzling white light faded, Yang Kai stood quietly to the side, holding the Myriad Sword. Not far away, Zhou An was drenched in blood, covered in wounds large and small, flesh torn, bones exposed, his clothes in tatters. The crimson glow that had burned outside his body was gone, and his aura was so weak it was barely detectable.

With difficulty, he rolled his eyes, fixing his gaze on the Myriad Sword in Yang Kai’s hand. He forced a bitter smile and said, “Imperial Treasure... I, Zhou, die without regret!”

With that, he fell straight to the ground. In midair, his eyes quickly lost their light.
