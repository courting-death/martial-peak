## Chapter 1980 — Reward

It would have been one thing if the other two pillmasters—even the last remaining Fan Hong—had been quietly poached by Zhuo Ningsi, but for her to brazenly try to charm Yang Kai right in front of him was an utter affront; she clearly held him in no regard.

Kang Siran was furious!

“Shopkeeper Kang, there’s no need to be angry.” Zhuo Ningsi showed no fear at all; after all, both of them were warriors of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and their Origin Qi had long since been fully transformed, only lacking the chance to break through to the Dao Origin Realm. She pursed her lips and laughed softly, “I only said a few words to Pillmaster Yang, I didn’t interfere with anything of yours, did I?”

Kang Siran’s face brimmed with murderous intent, but he dared not truly make a move; he could only choke back his rage, feeling as if his insides were burning.

Seeing the situation, Zhuo Ningsi turned her beautiful eyes back to Yang Kai and said, “Pillmaster Yang, what do you think of my proposal? As for the payment, don’t worry, I'll double the pay Shopkeeper Kang offered. How about that?”

At those words, Kang Siran’s face grew even more ashen.

The three pillmasters from the Spiritual Pill Shop had all been lured away by profit to join the Danqi Pavilion; he did not know Yang Kai well and had no close ties with him, so he had no clear idea what Yang Kai’s stance would be.

He looked toward Yang Kai in utter trepidation, and his heart immediately sank into an abyss!

Yang Kai’s expression, to everyone’s surprise, flickered with interest; he smiled broadly and said, “There’s such a good thing?”

Zhuo Ningsi laughed even more happily and nodded, “Of course. If Pillmaster Yang doesn’t believe me, you can ask Pillmaster Fan. Besides the promised payment, I will also provide four lovely maidservants to serve Pillmaster Yang and look after your daily life.”

A man’s life — in pursuit of fame and profit, all for power, wealth, and women. As an experienced woman, Zhuo Ningsi naturally knew what those men were thinking and so struck at the heart of the matter, successfully luring several pillmasters away from Shopkeeper Kang.

She believed that as long as Yang Kai wasn’t a fool, he ought to make a wise choice.

“Shopkeeper Zhuo’s offer truly stirs my heart.” Yang Kai’s eyes gleamed roguishly as they roved over the several maidservants.

Seeing his demeanor, Fan Hong could not help but snort coldly, a look of disdain flashing across his face as if he utterly despised Yang Kai’s character. Then, thinking he had no right to judge, he felt a bit awkward.

“Pillmaster Yang…” Kang Siran looked at Yang Kai in utter despair, words dying on his tongue. In the end, they could only turn into a helpless sigh.

Although he had only just signed a Soul Contract with Yang Kai, that agreement only bound the pill formula from being leaked.

Yang Kai had not yet taken any of the formulas from him; therefore the Soul Contract was of no practical use!

Kang Siran felt a surge of regret — had he known it would come to this, he would have written every stipulation into the contract. Now it was too late to regret it.

Zhuo Ningsi chuckled, her beautiful eyes bright with excitement as if she already saw the day the Spiritual Pill Shop would be forced to close and the day she would gain the favor of the Commerce Guild’s upper echelons.

If she could strike a heavy blow against the Spiritual Pill Shop, perhaps even force it into collapse, she would have a chance to win the attention of those above and be transferred from tiny Fenglin City to preside over guild affairs in a larger city.

Just as she intended to press her advantage and seal the matter, Yang Kai looked troubled and said, “What a pity…”

“Pity what?” Zhuo Ningsi’s brows knit.

“It’s a pity that I just signed a Soul Contract with Shopkeeper Kang… so even if I wished to, I’m afraid I can’t help you, Shopkeeper Zhuo.” Yang Kai sighed with mock regret and an expression full of annoyance.

Kang Siran was stunned, then looked at Yang Kai with uncontained joy.

He did not believe Yang Kai was unaware of what a Soul Contract limited; if Yang Kai said this, it meant he had no intention of joining the Danqi Pavilion, which thrilled him.

That excited look in his eyes toward Yang Kai was full of gratitude.

After all, if Yang Kai truly left, what could he do besides denounce Yang Kai for being untrustworthy? With no pillmasters left at the Spiritual Pill Shop, closure would not be far off.

Yang Kai’s attitude had become the straw that saved him; in an instant his appraisal of Yang Kai turned one hundred and eighty degrees, and Yang Kai’s figure suddenly seemed much larger.

“A Soul Contract!” Zhuo Ningsi shuddered in surprise. “Shopkeeper Kang is quite extravagant, even resorting to the precious Soul Contract.”

Kang Siran snorted coldly, “It was done out of necessity.”

“Shopkeeper Zhuo, consider this.” Yang Kai smiled at Zhuo Ningsi, “I will make pills for Shopkeeper Kang while also making pills for your Danqi Pavilion. I’ll only take half of the benefits you promised; how about that?”

“Go to hell.” Zhuo Ningsi shot Yang Kai a contemptuous look without holding back.

Upon learning that Yang Kai had signed a Soul Contract with Kang Siran, she instinctively felt it impossible to poach him, so she dispensed with any more politeness and lashed out with bitter words.

If she could not wrest him away, why bother to be courteous?

The speed at which this woman turned hostile left Yang Kai astonished as well.

Zhuo Ningsi no longer wished to entangle with Yang Kai; having achieved the purpose of her visit to the Spiritual Pill Shop, she sneered, “Shopkeeper Kang, now you only have a single pillmaster left; I want to see how long your shop can hang on! Let’s go.”

With that she waved and led the maidservants across the street; Fan Hong, no longer wishing to remain and be snubbed, hurried after them.

The commotion thus subsided, but Kang Siran’s brow remained furrowed into a deep crease.

The Spiritual Pill Shop’s plight hadn’t really eased. With Yang Kai’s arrival and Fan Hong also present, there were two pillmasters on duty, which put Kang Siran’s mind at ease and gave him confidence they could hold out for roughly two months while waiting for a master refiner sent from headquarters.

What he did not expect was that Fan Hong would leave just after Yang Kai arrived!

The situation had not changed at all.

Now his only hope was that Yang Kai’s pillmaking skill surpassed Fan Hong’s; but on reflection that seemed unlikely — Yang Kai had cultivation at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and had said himself that he treated pillmaking merely as a means to earn money, not something he would invest much effort into.

A pillmaster like that would certainly take pillmaking as a sideline; if he could occasionally produce Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills, that would be plenty. How could Kang Siran expect Yang Kai to be exceptionally talented?

Still, Yang Kai’s earlier conduct had left Kang Siran with a favorable impression — at the very least, Yang Kai was a man of his word.

Back in the private room, Kang Siran solemnly cupped his fists and said, “Pillmaster Yang, for today’s matter I, this old man, thank you. Without you, the Spiritual Pill Shop and my own face would have been ruined.”

Yang Kai waved his hand slightly, “Shopkeeper Kang exaggerates; I haven’t done much.”

Kang Siran smiled, “I still have some questions. Since Shopkeeper Zhuo offered such generous terms, why did Pillmaster Yang…”

“Three days ago I went to the Danqi Pavilion to try to buy some formulas, but I was rudely thrown out by the assistants there.”

“All because of that?” Kang Siran gaped.

“What else did you expect it to be?” Yang Kai chuckled.

“I understand. Then let us continue discussing payment. Our Spiritual Pill Shop can offer two ways of paying: one is a monthly salary — the shop gives you a certain amount of Source Crystals each month, and I can double that monthly salary for you.”

Perhaps out of gratitude that Yang Kai chose to stay, or perhaps in response to the terms Zhuo Ningsi had offered, Kang Siran did not scrimp and readily promised double pay for that option.

“The other is sharing profits: the shop supplies the materials and you, Pillmaster Yang, handle the refining; when the Spiritual Pills are sold, the profits are split proportionally between you and the shop. What do you think?”

“The second option.” Yang Kai replied without hesitation.

Kang Siran was taken aback!

He had expected Yang Kai to choose the first option; only those with skill would choose the profit-sharing arrangement, since more pills refined meant more pay.

He had regarded Yang Kai as a mediocre pillmaster, and the first option seemed the safest way to secure his interests; Yang Kai choosing the second surprised him greatly.

Could this Pillmaster Yang actually be a hidden master? Kang Siran felt a jolt of alarm.

To be cautious he asked, “Pillmaster Yang, are you sure? Pillmaster Fan previously received payment by the first method.”

“No need.” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Very well then.” Since it was the other’s choice, Kang Siran had no further objection.

Soon they settled on the exact split.

Ordinarily the split between shop and pillmaster was three to seven — the pillmaster taking thirty percent while the shop took seventy percent, since the shop provided all materials, handled sales, and bore losses from damaged ingredients; thirty percent for the pillmaster was fair.

But Kang Siran volunteered to split four to six with Yang Kai, and Yang Kai had no reason to refuse.

With everything agreed, Kang Siran asked, “Then it’s settled between us. Pillmaster Yang, would you like to rest for a few days first?”

Yang Kai smiled at him, “With the Spiritual Pill Shop’s situation like it is, when would I have time to rest? No time like the present — let’s begin. Shopkeeper Kang, fetch the formulas from the catalogue and I’ll study them for two days before I start refining the pills.”

“No rush, no rush — sharpen the axe and you’ll cut the wood quicker.” Kang Siran said as he reached into his Spatial Ring and took out the various formulas he had prepared, handing them to Yang Kai: “Pillmaster Yang, come with me to the refining room!”

The Spiritual Pill Shop had its own refining room, arranged with a Li Fire Array that drew firepower from underground for the pillmaster to use, located dozens of zhang beneath the shop; it had originally been for three pillmasters to share, but now it became Yang Kai’s domain.
