## Chapter 2163 — Qiong Qi

Inside the Time Temple, because everyone chose different paths, their opportunities were also different.

But at this very moment, no matter where they were, everyone inexplicably felt a sense of horror, as if somewhere in the unseen, a pair of lofty eyes was gazing down upon them...

This made everyone shudder, their bodies turning cold.

Fortunately, the feeling came quickly and left just as fast. In the blink of an eye, it vanished, making them wonder if it was just their imagination.

In the dark grand hall, that strange beast was still observing all directions, occasionally making comments. Many elite martial artists were dismissed as trash by it. When it turned its gaze toward the Time Staircase, it was genuinely surprised, "What’s with this little bug... One, two, three, four, five! A guy at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm actually has five Imperial Treasures on him? What’s his background?"

Even though the beast had lived for countless tens of thousands of years and seen countless storms, it was still shocked by Yang Kai’s foundation, because it discovered that Yang Kai alone carried five Imperial Treasures!

Even an ordinary Emperor wouldn’t have so many Imperial Treasures, right?

The five it mentioned were, of course, the Extinction Thunder Bead, Xuan Realm Pearl, Slave-Insect Bracelet, Soul-Severing Blade, and Myriad Sword! In this Time Temple, nothing could escape its observation.

"Could it be that his whole family are Great Emperors?" the beast secretly guessed. Otherwise, how could a martial artist have so many Imperial Treasures? Imperial Treasures weren’t something you could find on every street corner.

Take someone as noble as Lan Xun, for example. She only had one Imperial Treasure, and that was a defensive Imperial Treasure bestowed upon her by Radiant Moon Great Emperor to protect her from harm.

"Forget it, forget it. Although his aptitude and temperament are top-notch, this guy just looks like trouble. It’s best not to get involved with him." The beast muttered for a while, then shifted its gaze from Yang Kai to Zhang Ruoxi.

"Hmm, this little girl... why is she only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!" Suspicion flickered in the beast’s eyes. "With such low cultivation, how did she get in here? How is it that I just took a nap, and so many strange things have happened..."

At this point, it suddenly widened its eyes, staring hard in Zhang Ruoxi’s direction, and exclaimed, "No, this little girl... she actually..."

In that instant, as if it had discovered something, its previously arrogant tone suddenly turned extremely fearful, and even those terrifying beast eyes showed a look of shock, as if it was deeply afraid of Zhang Ruoxi.

Cold sweat actually dripped down from its huge head...

Just then, Zhang Ruoxi seemed to have reached her limit. The end of the Time Staircase was not far ahead, but no matter what, she couldn’t lift her feet. Stubbornly, she raised her head to look, wanting to take another step, but felt completely drained, her legs heavy as if filled with lead.

The power of time filling the Time Staircase suddenly erupted, invading Zhang Ruoxi’s body, trying to swallow her whole.

Close behind her, Yang Kai, who had caught up to within a dozen steps, clearly saw Zhang Ruoxi’s black hair turn snow-white in an instant. Yang Kai was greatly alarmed, realizing something was wrong. He urged his Origin Qi and struggled forward, trying to close the distance between them.

But climbing the Time Staircase at this point, every step was extremely difficult. Those short dozen steps were not something Yang Kai could shorten at will.

He was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan...

Equally anxious was the strange beast in the grand hall. As the guardian of the Time Temple, it naturally saw Zhang Ruoxi’s condition and changes.

At first, it was secretly delighted, thinking Zhang Ruoxi was doomed, but soon felt uneasy, because if Zhang Ruoxi was forced to the brink, the power of her bloodline lurking within her might awaken. If that happened, it would be a disaster for itself.

Thinking of this, the beast stood up, stretched out a claw, and reached into the void. Space shattered under its strike, and its huge claw crossed the barrier, grabbing Zhang Ruoxi in its palm and immediately pulling her back.

As it did so, it muttered anxiously, "Calamity, calamity... I don’t know if this is right or wrong!"

When it finished, it slowly opened its claw, placing the bewildered Zhang Ruoxi before itself.

Zhang Ruoxi still hadn’t figured out what had happened. She only felt endless time passing over her, as if she had lived a hundred years in that brief moment. Her vitality seemed to fade, and the breath of death rushed toward her.

She wanted to turn and call out to Yang Kai, but couldn’t even move.

Just when she thought she was doomed, a giant claw descended from the sky, pulling her back from the gates of death and bringing her into the pitch-black grand hall.

She looked up and saw a huge demonic beast burning with flames, staring at her with beastly eyes.

Most people, seeing such a massive creature, would probably turn pale, scream, and run away.

Zhang Ruoxi herself wasn’t particularly brave, her cultivation wasn’t high, and her experience was limited. It wouldn’t be surprising if she fainted from fright.

But for some reason, as she looked up at the demonic beast, she felt no fear at all. Instead, she had the sense that the other party should be afraid of her. This feeling was baseless and absurd, but it was something that came from deep within, as natural as breathing, and impossible to doubt.

She gently pressed her red lips together and looked up at the giant demonic beast, her small figure forming a stark contrast with it.

As their eyes met, it was the demonic beast that felt uneasy, cold sweat pouring from its forehead, its gaze flickering.

"You... why do you seem so afraid of me?" Zhang Ruoxi suddenly asked.

As soon as she spoke, the demonic beast actually retreated two steps, looking at her in fear. A muffled thunderous sound came from its belly as it forced a laugh, "Hehe... Yes, why should I be afraid of you?"

Zhang Ruoxi didn’t press further and simply beckoned to it.

Seeing this, the demonic beast actually came over, crouching before Zhang Ruoxi. Its fierce eyes became gentle, and there was even a hint of fear and dread.

"Did you save me?" Zhang Ruoxi asked.

The demonic beast thought for a moment and replied, "That’s right!"

"Thank you!" Zhang Ruoxi smiled sweetly, reaching out as if to touch the beast’s head. But she hesitated, "I won’t hurt you, will I?"

She didn’t know why she asked, but something told her that touching this beast might harm it.

"Right now, you probably won’t!" the demonic beast replied.

Only then did Zhang Ruoxi place her hand on its forehead and gently stroke it.

The scorching flames burned against Zhang Ruoxi’s fair hand, yet miraculously didn’t harm her. As she stroked it, the demonic beast actually purred like a cat being petted.

"How humiliating, how humiliating... For this Lord to be stroked by a little girl—what an utter disgrace!" the demonic beast fumed inwardly. Yet its body responded with embarrassing honesty.

"What’s your name?" Zhang Ruoxi suddenly asked.

"Qiong Qi!"

"What a strange name!" Zhang Ruoxi smiled, her beautiful eyes showing confusion. "I don’t know why, but even though it’s the first time I’ve heard it, it feels familiar... Do you know why?"

"No idea!" Qiong Qi shook its head like a rattle drum, secretly thinking it’d be best if she never figured it out. How could it tell her such things? If she really knew, wouldn’t that be its end!

"Alright..." Zhang Ruoxi said, withdrawing her hand. Sincerely, she said, "Thank you for saving my life just now, but could you send me back? If I suddenly disappear, Sir will be very worried."

"Sir?" Qiong Qi asked suspiciously, "You mean the man following behind you?"

"Yes. Can you see him?" Zhang Ruoxi nodded quickly.

Qiong Qi replied proudly, "In this temple, nothing escapes my... observation! I saw you were in danger, so I brought you over."

After a pause, it shook its head and said, "Who would’ve thought, someone as strong as you still needs protection from others..."

Although it deliberately lowered its voice, its booming tone was still clear to Zhang Ruoxi.

Zhang Ruoxi hurriedly waved her hands, embarrassment coloring her face. “What are you saying… Sir is the amazing one. How could I possibly be strong?”

She just thought Qiong Qi was making things up to cheer her up.

"One day, you’ll be strong," Qiong Qi said meaningfully.

"Mm, I’ll work hard," Zhang Ruoxi replied with determination.

"Since fate brought us together today, let me give you something." Qiong Qi suddenly remembered something and spoke, reaching out a claw to grab at the void.

When it withdrew its claw, a pink, radiant dress appeared, shimmering with Imperial aura and looking stunningly beautiful.

"Your strength is still low, so I’ll give you this Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress. Once you wear it, most people won’t be able to harm you." Qiong Qi’s strength was unmatched, and by "most people," it meant anyone below the Emperor Realm.

"How can I accept this?" Zhang Ruoxi liked the treasure, but her good upbringing wouldn’t let her accept such a gift for no reason, so she quickly refused.

"Just put it on. This is your opportunity. For a martial artist, opportunity is part of becoming strong!" Qiong Qi said, but in its heart it thought: "If I weren’t worried about some fool provoking you and awakening your bloodline power too soon, I wouldn’t go to such lengths! I’ve worked so hard, planning ahead isn’t easy. When I get out of here, I should go to the Dragon Isle and extort those old dragons. After all, this isn’t just my problem; those old dragons can’t just sit by..."
