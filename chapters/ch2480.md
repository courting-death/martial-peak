## Chapter 2480 — Blood Spirit Bottle

A violent force swept over, and Yang Kai bore the brunt of it, instantly engulfed.

Rumble…

The Ice and Fire Nine Heavens secret art crushed everything in its path, then gradually faded, its power dissipating.

Wu Mengchuan, however, stood in place with a grave expression, staring intently ahead.

When the dust settled, Yang Kai stood ragged in the void. Though battered, he was not in mortal danger, his expression solemn as he formed seals with both hands.

A mysterious aura spread out.

Wu Mengchuan suddenly felt an intense sense of unease. His heart pounded wildly for reasons he could not fathom. It was as if time itself had slowed, his perception suppressed, and everything around him froze—except for Yang Kai, whose movements were as swift as lightning.

A brilliant hand seal suddenly formed. Yang Kai thrust his palm forward and shouted in a low voice, “Years Like a Shuttle!”

Wu Mengchuan’s face changed dramatically. Instinctively sensing danger, he wanted to dodge, but found himself utterly immobile—even his thoughts seemed to freeze in that instant.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Art was of no use at all.

That brilliant hand seal struck directly toward Wu Mengchuan.

At this critical moment, Wu Mengchuan suddenly bit the tip of his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of Essence-Blood. With a flick of his wrist, a blood-red bottle appeared in his hand. The bottle was not large, about a foot tall, but the moment it appeared, it exuded an extremely thick scent of blood.

Crimson light burst from the bottle, so dense it seemed almost tangible. The stench of blood was overwhelming, and the light began to flow, transforming into a crimson glow that swept forward.

At a glance, it looked like a vast sea of blood had spread out, filling the enormous void.

Boom boom boom…

The Years Like a Shuttle seal crashed into the sea of blood, stirring up towering waves. The blood sea churned violently, and Wu Mengchuan grunted repeatedly, stumbling backward.

Even after summoning this bizarre Secret Treasure, he could not avoid being struck by the Great Emperor of Time’s divine ability. His face rapidly aged, clearly showing he was seriously injured, but his expression steadied, no longer panicked as before.

Glaring at Yang Kai, Wu Mengchuan growled, “I didn’t expect you to have such a divine ability!”

Yang Kai frowned deeply, scanning his surroundings.

From the moment Wu Mengchuan summoned that blood-red bottle until now, only three breaths had passed, yet his environment had changed dramatically.

The air was thick with the stench of blood, and the sea of blood below churned, bubbling. Faintly, the wails of ghosts and wolves could be heard from within.

The surrounding space seemed to be isolated by the blood sea. Even though Yang Kai was proficient in space powers, he could not probe beyond the blood sea. It was as if this place had become a small world, much like the Xuan Realm Pearl, completely cut off from the outside.

What is this thing? Yang Kai wondered. The only thing he was certain of was that the blood-red bottle was an Imperial Treasure!

Moreover, it was very likely a relic left behind by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. After all, Wu Mengchuan had not yet reached the Emperor Realm and could not possibly possess his own Imperial Treasure.

If this really was the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s Imperial Treasure, then things were dire indeed. Yang Kai’s face darkened.

“Boy, what kind of divine ability is this? It’s completely different from your Space Laws just now!” Wu Mengchuan shouted again.

Yang Kai shot him a cold look and snorted, “Why ask so many questions when you’re about to die?”

Wu Mengchuan was taken aback, then burst out laughing. “You’re quite bold, boy. But to force this Lord to use the Blood Spirit Bottle, you can be proud!”

“Blood Spirit Bottle!” Yang Kai’s brows rose. He now knew the name of that Imperial Treasure.

“That’s right!” Wu Mengchuan said smugly. “This is an Imperial Treasure left by my ancestor. Only those of the Wu bloodline can use it—no one else can control it. Though the Blood Spirit Bottle isn’t my ancestor’s greatest work, it’s more than enough to deal with you.”

So this really was an Imperial Treasure left by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor for his descendants. Yang Kai’s heart trembled.

Wu Mengchuan continued, “Inside this Lord’s Blood Spirit Bottle, even if you’re skilled in space powers, don’t dream of escaping. Today, you either submit to this Lord, or die here!”

Yang Kai sneered, “You’d better worry about yourself. After being struck by my Time divine ability, how much longer can you live?”

Although the Years Like a Shuttle seal hadn’t achieved its full effect, it had at least injured Wu Mengchuan. His rapidly aging face was proof enough, and the Power of Time invading his body was not something easily dispelled. That power would continue to erode Wu Mengchuan’s vitality until he died of old age.

“A mere secret art—what can it do to me?” Wu Mengchuan snorted, reaching out. The blood below surged toward him like rivers returning to the sea. As the blood entered him, his aged face quickly regained its youthful glow, seemingly no longer affected by the Power of Time.

But Yang Kai keenly noticed Wu Mengchuan’s brows furrow, a trace of shock flashing across his face.

And his newly restored face quickly aged again.

“What power is this!” Wu Mengchuan was finally shaken, asking in shock.

His method of restoring vitality with the blood was only a temporary fix. Unless he kept absorbing the blood here, he would eventually die. Realizing this, Wu Mengchuan was finally afraid.

Yang Kai laughed loudly, mocking, “Didn’t you claim you could devour all things? Why not devour it yourself and see how it feels?”

“You’re courting death, boy! I’d hoped to spare your life and use you, but now it seems I must kill you!” Wu Mengchuan roared in fury. With a wave of his hand, the blood sea surged, and a blood dragon burst forth, lifelike and terrifying, its eyes the size of houses, claws bared as it lunged at Yang Kai.

To Wu Mengchuan’s surprise, faced with such a ferocious attack, Yang Kai merely stood in place, sneering lightly.

What is this brat up to? Wu Mengchuan was filled with suspicion, unsure of Yang Kai’s intentions. To avoid any mishaps, he attacked again, and several more blood dragons shot out from the sea, surrounding Yang Kai from all directions.

Yang Kai snorted, “Wu Mengchuan, your strength is beyond my expectations. But to force me to use this treasure, you can be proud!”

He returned Wu Mengchuan’s earlier words right back at him.

Wu Mengchuan was furious. “So arrogant, boy! In this Lord’s Blood Spirit Bottle, what waves can you possibly make? Just accept your death!”

Yang Kai said calmly, “The one who’s going to die is you!”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and summoned the Mountain and River Bell. Origin Qi surged, Divine Sense poured in, and he channeled power into the bell.

The Mountain and River Bell rapidly expanded, the intricate patterns on its surface coming alive, moving vividly. A wild, ancient aura erupted.

“This is…” Wu Mengchuan’s eyes widened in shock as he stared at the bell, nearly biting off his own tongue in his astonishment.

As a descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, he was more attentive than anyone to everything in the Shattered Star Sea and what had happened here. He knew which Great Emperors had fallen and what treasures had been left behind.

So the moment the Mountain and River Bell appeared, he recognized it immediately.

“Impossible!” Wu Mengchuan shouted.

No matter what, he could not believe that Yang Kai had actually subdued the Mountain and River Bell.

This was the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor’s life-bound Imperial Treasure! It was a relic from the Primordial Era that the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor had brought out from the ancient wilds.

But wasn’t the Mountain and River Bell supposed to be suppressing the True Phoenix Fire, lost in the void? How could it appear in Yang Kai’s hands?

If the Mountain and River Bell was here, then where was the True Phoenix Fire?

If this really was the Mountain and River Bell, then his life was in grave danger today!

Clang…

A deep, resonant bell sound suddenly rang out. Visible shockwaves spread in all directions, the sound carrying a power that could destroy the world, enough to suppress everything.

The blood dragons lunging at Yang Kai instantly shattered, reverting to blood and falling below.

Wu Mengchuan’s whole body trembled, and he staggered back several steps. When he finally steadied himself, blood was already seeping from his ears and nose.

This was truly the Mountain and River Bell!

Wu Mengchuan’s vision went white, his mind reeling so much he could no longer see, his head buzzing.

Having personally endured the Mountain and River Bell’s shock, he no longer had any doubts.

And after the Mountain and River Bell appeared, Wu Mengchuan’s body stiffened, pinned in place by an invisible force. Even the once-turbulent blood sea instantly calmed, not a single ripple remaining.

The Mountain and River Bell—its toll could quell mountains and rivers, its Imperial Aura capable of turning the very heavens upside down.

If the Heaven Devouring Battle Art could devour anything, then the Mountain and River Bell could suppress anything. There was nothing in this world it could not subdue.

“Puh…” Wu Mengchuan finally couldn’t hold it in, spitting out a mouthful of blood, his face suddenly aging dramatically.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “Wu Mengchuan, today, this place will be your grave. Just die already!”

As he shouted, he swung his hand down. The Mountain and River Bell plummeted, crashing into the blood sea and vanishing from sight.

But in the next moment, the entire blood sea boiled, and at the same time, cracking sounds echoed from all directions.

Wu Mengchuan’s face changed drastically as he shouted, “Stop! Stop now! You’ll destroy this Lord’s Blood Spirit Bottle!”

This space had been sealed when he summoned the Blood Spirit Bottle. Now, with the Mountain and River Bell pressing down, the Blood Spirit Bottle could not withstand it. If this continued, the Imperial Treasure left by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor would surely be damaged.

Yang Kai sneered, “You’re about to die, and you’re still worried about your bottle?”

If the Blood Spirit Bottle could be used by him, Yang Kai wouldn’t be so ruthless. After all, it was a treasure left by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, priceless beyond measure. But Wu Mengchuan had said only those of the Wu bloodline could control it, so it was useless to Yang Kai even if he obtained it.

So he showed no mercy.

Crack crack crack…

The sounds grew even more intense.

Wu Mengchuan’s face turned ashen as he shouted, “Stop! We can talk this out!”

Yang Kai replied coldly, “There’s nothing to talk about!”

Splash…

A sound rang out as the blood sea that filled the world was suddenly torn open, and the sealing force around them vanished.
