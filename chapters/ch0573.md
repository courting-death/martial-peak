## Chapter 573 — Hearts United

Inside Su Yan’s room, a biting chill filled the air, with wisps of white mist curling and swirling clearly visible.

This was a cellar specially crafted for Su Yan because her cultivation required the use of the Cold Ice Bed. The sharp cold radiated from the Cold Ice Bed was not something just anyone could endure.

Ever since the people from Lingxiao Pavilion arrived here, Yang Kai had specially created a room exclusively for Su Yan.

At this moment, in the room, on that millennia-old Cold Ice Bed, Yang Kai and Su Yan sat facing each other. Their pure True Yuan was blending together seamlessly, indistinguishable and endlessly circulating. Streams of radiant light would occasionally sparkle on their bodies, appearing and disappearing.

As their True Yuan circulated, a subtle but encouraging change seemed to be occurring.

Tiny glimmers of light emitted from both of them, quickly filling the entire room, turning the cold and monotonous space vibrant with colors.

As the glowing light spread, their True Yuan became interconnected, their hearts united, and their Divine Sense intertwined, as if they had become one inseparable existence.

Suddenly, a resounding dragon roar echoed out. In the next moment, a gigantic, unparalleled, fierce, and majestic dragon head appeared behind Yang Kai.

The dragon head swayed, detaching from Yang Kai’s body. It was golden in hue, shaking its head and wagging its tail as it charged upward.

At the same time, a crisp phoenix cry rang out.

Behind Su Yan, a crystal-clear white Ice Phoenix appeared.

The noble and elegant Ice Phoenix chased after the majestic golden dragon, the two entwining with each other as they soared directly into the Ninth Heaven.

As wind and clouds stirred, the dragon’s roar and the phoenix’s cry instantly stirred the heavens and earth.

Powerful and unmatched energy waves spread out. Two completely different types of energy twined together, yet somehow harmonized, complementing and augmenting one another with a subtle balance.

The entire mansion buzzed with excitement as countless people rushed out, staring blankly at the golden dragon and Ice Phoenix soaring in the sky, dumbfounded.

No one knew why such a rare celestial phenomenon had appeared.

“I’ve seen this before…” someone murmured.

Indeed, disciples from Fengyu Tower, Blood Battle Gang, and Lingxiao Pavilion were not strangers to this scene.

Five or six years ago, above the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area, a dragon-shaped phoenix emblem rose into the air. The Inheritance Celestial Cave opened outward, and the three sects joined forces, dispatching their elite disciples to enter the Inheritance Celestial Cave in search of fortune.

Though the disciples gained many benefits, no one ultimately knew who had obtained the dragon-shaped phoenix emblem’s inheritance.

Now, seeing this familiar scene instantly awakened memories long sealed away.

Clearly, the one who had gained the inheritance back then had now cultivated successfully, causing this heavenly phenomenon to reappear.

For some reason, all three sects’ disciples immediately thought of Yang Kai, as if it was only natural he had gained that final inheritance.

Looking carefully at the spot from which the golden dragon and Ice Phoenix emerged, everyone instantly understood.

It was indeed as they suspected — the final inheritance had truly gone to Yang Kai.

For a moment, everyone was exhilarated. Though the inheritance was not theirs, the reappearance of this phenomenon signaled Yang Kai’s progress, and his progress meant a way forward for the entire estate.

In these chaotic times, having a strong leader naturally meant survival for longer. Especially this leader was known for being generous with his warriors.

“A dragon and phoenix bring auspiciousness, a good omen,” Meng Wuya said with a smile as he opened the window to watch the Golden Dragon gallop and the Ice Phoenix soar above.

Ling Taixu stroked his beard gently, nodding with satisfaction and joy.

Outside the mansion, Shan Qingluo and Bilo stared blankly upward. Suddenly, the enchanting queen smiled alluringly, “Bilo, this has got to be that little bastard’s doing. Do you believe it or not?”

Bilo nodded absentmindedly, shooting Shan Qingluo a glance and softly saying, “Lady, if you really want, just betray the Sacred Land. Once inside, the Evil Lord won’t be able to touch you.”

Shan Qingluo shook her head. “It’s not that I’m afraid of the Evil Lord. I just don’t want to harm him.”

“Harm him?” Bilo expressed doubt. She didn’t understand the overwhelming power of Shan Qingluo’s poisonous widow constitution, so naturally she couldn’t comprehend why the lady had lingered outside the estate for months without entering to be with that bastard.

Lady clearly liked him. Bilo had seen many times how Shan Qingluo’s expression dimmed with sorrow.

“The closer I get to him, the faster he’ll die.” Shan Qingluo smiled bitterly.

Even just remaining outside the estate, the affliction of love grew swiftly. Often, the enchanting queen would feel an irresistible flutter of emotion surge up, wishing to rush into Yang Kai’s mansion and be with him.

But each time, she firmly suppressed it.

“I don’t understand,” Bilo shook her head and sighed softly, unwilling to see the queen she admired turn into this.

“You wouldn’t. It is the fate of the Enchantress Queen bloodline,” Shan Qingluo’s alluring eyes filled with sorrow.

A hundred li away, in Zhongdu.

Even at such a distance, the heavenly phenomenon of the dragon and phoenix was clearly visible to those there.

The Five Great Evil Kings looked relaxed, despite their surprise at the phenomenon. Only the Evil Lord, Yang Bai, stared toward War City with deep fear.

The people of the Eight Great Families whispered amongst themselves, none knowing why such a scene had appeared in War City.

Ever since the massive assault from the Cangyun Evil Land, Zhongdu had lost contact with War City. Only the Fourth Master Yang and his wife knew that Yang Kai’s estate was safe.

Others assumed the entire War City had been destroyed, with no survivors.

Seeing this phenomenon, Yang Yinghao, head of the Yang Family, suddenly comprehended something. He turned to Yang Yingfeng and said, “Fourth Brother, is everything alright at Yang Kai’s side?”

Dong Suzhu instantly pinched Fourth Master Yang softly as a silent warning not to answer.

The Yang Family had treated Yang Kai unfairly before. When the Seven Great Families’ allied forces attacked Yang Kai, the Yang Family stood by and did nothing. Dong Suzhu bore a grudge against the Yang Family because of that.

The straightforward Fourth Master Yang hesitated a moment before nodding faintly. “Yang Zhao and Yang Wei are also safe, currently at Kai’er’s estate.”

Yang Yinghao seemed to relax but masked it quickly, saying lightly, “If possible, thank your Yang Kai for me.”

Yang Zhao was his son, so his concern was natural. But since Cangyun Evil Land's invasion, he, as Yang Family head, was busy managing affairs and didn’t even know his son’s status.

Hearing Fourth Master Yang’s words, he naturally breathed easier.

“Hmph, just don’t target my precious son. Save your thanks.” Dong Suzhu pouted.

Yang Yinghao glanced at her, his eyes filled with faint guilt.

...

Inside the room, Yang Kai and Su Yan opened their eyes simultaneously, exchanging looks and smiling.

The Dual Cultivation Technique had finally successfully broken through to the Third-Tier stage — Hearts United.

Not only had the Dual Cultivation Technique reached this stage, but the long period of meditative cultivation had also elevated both their realms.

Yang Kai had reached the Fourth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, while Su Yan had reached the Fifth Stage, closing the gap between them to only one small realm.

Though three months of seclusion with a single breakthrough was already very fast, this speed was the fastest possible under the support of the Dual Cultivation Technique.

Compared with his earlier breakthrough speed, Yang Kai was still a bit dissatisfied.

Yet, reaching the Third Tier diluted his dissatisfaction.

Arriving at this stage meant that he and Su Yan were truly united in heart; their thoughts connected much more clearly than the vague perception they had before.

One could even say that as long as both wished, they could clearly understand each other’s every thought, as if delving into each other’s Sea of Consciousness to glimpse secrets.

But neither was idle enough to do so. Only in battle would they connect their energy, spirit, and mind.

When that time came, their combat power would surge enormously.

“Ah, I almost forgot something.” Yang Kai suddenly remembered something, his voice filled with excitement.

“What?”

“This.” Yang Kai flipped his hand, revealing the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng.

This Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng was inadvertently obtained back in the Inheritance Celestial Cave. As Earth Demon had explained, whenever a pair of hearts united, this celestial treasure would begin to work. Yet until now, Yang Kai and Su Yan had not reached that level.

Now it was time for the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng to show its true power.

“It’s that,” Su Yan said with a faint smile, recognizing the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng.

It was a celestial treasure, naturally born from the heavens and earth, one side red as fire and the other cold as ice. It even had a certain awareness of its surroundings, able to seek fortune and avoid harm.

Many such celestial treasures existed in the world, but even elite warriors rarely saw one.

These treasures were incredibly scarce and precious.

“How exactly should we use it?” Yang Kai frowned. Earth Demon only mentioned that once hearts united, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng could act, but never specified how.

Could it be that they each should eat half?

Yang Kai felt uneasy. The ginseng had consciousness and wasn’t a simple herb; biting into it plainly felt inappropriate.

While puzzled, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng began to react. It had remained hidden in the Black Book Space until now, and its vague features visibly brightened with joy when it saw Yang Kai and Su Yan.

It quickly transformed into a stream of light, swirling continuously around the two.

As it spun rapidly, it emitted a strange sound, reminiscent of an infant’s joyful cooing.

Magical strands of energy radiated from within the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, enveloping Yang Kai and Su Yan completely.

Its spinning accelerated, emanating energy increasingly fast until suddenly it exploded into a cluster of shimmering light, enveloping them both.
