## Chapter 1917 — Satisfactory or Not?

Waiting outside the Medicine Master Hall for Yang Kai was Shen Tu.

Hearing Yang Kai ask, Shen Tu hurriedly said, "My father told me to wait for you here."

"Chairman Ai Ou wants to see me?" Yang Kai asked.

"Nothing urgent, only… the young madam has awakened. I heard it was the pill you refined that revived her, and she insists on thanking you in person. If you have time, come with me." Shen Tu said seriously.

"All right." Yang Kai nodded.

The two of them then walked on side by side.

Gu Bihu’s awakening was not a surprise to Yang Kai. After all, Ai Ou had already given her a drop of Immortal Source Liquid, which had long since repaired the wounds on her body; the reason she had remained unconscious was entirely due to damage to her spirit.

A single Taichu Soul-Returning Pill was enough to solve that problem.

Moreover, the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill Yang Kai had refined bore pill patterns, and its medicinal effect was several times stronger than an ordinary Taichu Soul-Returning Pill. With that Spiritual Pill nourishing her spirit, it would be strange if Gu Bihu did not awaken; she might even use that pill to benefit her spirit.

On the road, Shen Tu kept glancing at Yang Kai from time to time, his expression odd, as if he wanted to say something but held back.

Yang Kai laughed, "Brother Shen Tu, if you have something to ask, just say it—there's no need to hold back between us."

Shen Tu's mouth twitched and he said solemnly, "I just want to know—are you really a Void King-Grade alchemist? Was that Spiritual Pill truly refined by you?"

He had known Yang Kai for a while, though their interactions had been limited. He had never imagined that over the years Yang Kai had not only progressed in his Martial Dao but had achieved such astonishing results in the Pill Dao.

Compared to him, his cultivation at the Origin Returning Realm really felt like nothing.

He used to pride himself on his talent, but now… Shen Tu felt utterly shattered by the blow.

"I am indeed a Void King-Grade alchemist, and the Spiritual Pill was refined by me," Yang Kai nodded in acknowledgment.

Shen Tu slapped his thigh in frustration, "So the contest between you and Master Zuo De over alchemy was real?"

"Oh—did that spread?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"It's become the talk of the town; the whole of Shuitian City probably knows. Knowing this earlier, I would have come to Shuitian City with you—what a pity to have missed such a spectacle. I've never liked Zuo De; seeing him get knocked down would be most gratifying." Shen Tu said with a doleful face.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said nothing further.

"By the way, Brother Yang—do you know my young madam?"

"Never met her. Why?"

"If you haven't met her, why would you willingly gamble two thousand years of your freedom against Master Zuo De for alchemy? When the young madam learned the reason for this, she even blamed my father for not stopping you."

Yang Kai laughed, "Because I knew I wouldn't lose. What's a big wager if I can win?"

Shen Tu, upon hearing this, couldn't help but give Yang Kai a thumbs-up and said, "Anyway, the young madam thinks highly of you; you'll see once she meets you."

As they chatted, they soon arrived at an estate.

It was still within Shuitian City, but the surroundings were exquisitely beautiful and quiet—surely the place where Gu Bihu had recuperated. Arrays of restrictive formations were laid throughout the estate; when Yang Kai swept them with his Divine Sense, he detected their strength and was secretly alarmed.

Inside the estate, there were small bridges and flowing water, and the sound of zithers and flutes drifted in the air, making one feel refreshingly at ease.

Shen Tu led Yang Kai deeper in; no one dared block their way.

Before long they reached the deepest part of the estate, where a grove of purple bamboo stood, and within it a modest-looking cottage.

Yang Kai sensed three presences in the bamboo house: one was Chairman Ai Ou, another was Xue Yue, and the third, unfamiliar aura was likely Gu Bihu.

Shen Tu stopped outside the bamboo house and called loudly, "Father, I have brought Brother Yang."

"Please come in!" Ai Ou's voice called from inside.

Shen Tu smiled at Yang Kai, "Please go ahead, Brother Yang."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and walked forward.

Upon entering the bamboo house, Yang Kai immediately felt three pairs of eyes turn toward him.

Before he could inspect the room's furnishings, Chairman Ai Ou strode over laughing and slapped Yang Kai hard on the shoulder, saying, "Brother Yang, I must thank you properly this time. If not for you, my wife wouldn't have awakened so smoothly."

He struck with considerable force; though he did not use Saint Yuan, the hefty palm still made Yang Kai's shoulder emit a thudding sound.

Xue Yue stood to one side, her expression strange.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he cupped his fists and said, "Chairman Ai Ou, you're too kind. Xue Yue and I are friends—this was a small matter, nothing to mention."

"To you it is small, but to my wife and me it is life-saving. This kindness I cannot forget," Ai Ou said, his expression serious.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said nothing further, instead turning his gaze elsewhere.

Since he entered, a pair of bright eyes had been studying him intently, filled with scrutiny.

Those eyes belonged to Gu Bihu.

When Yang Kai looked back, Gu Bihu smiled at him.

She did not look old—dressed as a woman in her twenties or thirties, her Martial Dao cultivation reached the peak of the Origin Returning Realm. Perhaps because she had only just awakened, her complexion was somewhat pale, which added a kind of sickly beauty.

Truly a woman of peerless beauty, Yang Kai understood why Ai Ou had valued her so highly.

"You must be Master Yang? Indeed a dragon among men, outstanding in every way," Gu Bihu said softly; her voice was light but pleasant to the ear.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he instinctively felt it was a bit odd for Gu Bihu—a mere Origin Returning Realm cultivator—to praise him in such a tone as if she were an elder addressing a junior. By logic and courtesy, it was slightly improper.

Yang Kai did not dwell on it and cupped his fists, "Greetings, Madam Gu!"

Gu Bihu coughed lightly and smiled, "Master Yang, you're too polite. You saved my life; I should have come to thank you in person, but my current state makes it unsuitable to travel, so I had Shen Tu invite you here. I hope Master Yang won't blame me."

"Not at all. Madam Gu is Xue Yue's elder; since Xue Yue and I are friends, it is natural I come to pay my respects."

Gu Bihu nodded slightly. She seemed very pleased with Yang Kai, which left Ai Ou baffled.

He hurriedly said, "My wife and I were still discussing how best to thank you, but we can't think of anything suitable right now. How about you tell me—what do you want? If Ai Ou can arrange it, I will see it done."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened at this and he glanced briefly at Xue Yue.

Feeling his gaze, Xue Yue quickly turned away, pretending to be composed.

Gu Bihu observed their expressions and suddenly laughed softly, saying, "I just had an idea."

"Oh? Madam, what do you have in mind? Do tell," Ai Ou exclaimed, looking toward her eagerly.

Gu Bihu smiled faintly and, without speaking, beckoned both Xue Yue and Yang Kai.

The two exchanged a glance, uncertain of her intent, and stepped to her bedside.

Gu Bihu reached out, taking Xue Yue's hand in one of hers and Yang Kai's hand in the other, and then brought their hands together between them. She looked at Yang Kai with a beaming smile and said, "Master Yang, do you find this token of thanks satisfactory?"

Yang Kai was momentarily taken aback, but soon laughed and praised, "Madam Gu, you are gentle and refined—this token of thanks pleases me greatly."

Xue Yue was stunned for a moment; once she realized Gu Bihu's intention, her pretty face flushed scarlet and she stomped her foot coquettishly, "Foster mother…"

Ai Ou widened his eyes and, after watching for a moment, felt something was amiss. He cried out in astonishment, "Madam, what are you doing?"

"Don't you get it?" Gu Bihu glanced at Ai Ou and said calmly, "Master Yang has probably known Xue Yue's secret for some time. Perhaps the two of them were already in love!"

"What?" Ai Ou was shocked, his formerly amiable expression gone, replaced by a hostile look directed at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai ignored the hostility and smiled faintly, "Madam Gu is correct; I did know long ago that Xue Yue is a woman. But… how did you deduce that? I didn't show any obvious sign, did I? I don't believe Xue Yue told you."

Gu Bihu smiled lightly, "It's simple. We are strangers—why would you risk two thousand years of freedom to gamble with Master Zuo De for me? If neither my husband nor I could compel you to do such a thing, the only explanation is Xue Yue. A man will only act recklessly for a woman."

Yang Kai showed a look of realization, "So Madam Gu guessed this as soon as you awakened?"

"I suspected it, but wasn't certain, so I called you here. After observing just now… I am sure."

"Madam Gu is indeed exceptionally perceptive!" Yang Kai praised; to infer from so little that he and Xue Yue were in love was no ordinary feat.

It seemed Gu Bihu was more than just beautiful.

"Xue Yue, is this true?" Ai Ou's face fell so hard it might have cut a layer of frost; he asked sharply.

Xue Yue bit her lip and nodded ever so slightly.

"You… you really make me furious!" Ai Ou looked exasperated and bitter; he had raised Xue Yue as if she were a boy to be his successor at the Hengluo Commerce Guild, and he could not believe she would fall for someone else.

Thinking of how many times he had called Yang Kai 'Brother Yang,' Ai Ou felt like crawling into a hole—no wonder the young man's expression had been strange back then; now he knew why.

At that realization, Ai Ou felt he had been dealt a great loss.

"Xue Yue is no longer a child—since you raised her as a boy all these years, are you prepared to let her pretend to be a man forever?" Gu Bihu looked at Ai Ou seriously and said, "Every woman deserves to pursue her own happiness. Master Yang, by his character, looks, and cultivation, is an excellent match for Xue Yue. The rare thing is that they both have feelings for each other—this is not something you should interfere with."
