## Chapter 2449 — Suppression

To Yang Kai’s slight disappointment, the clash between these two supreme Origin Powers lasted less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea before both suddenly withdrew, their fierce confrontation coming to an abrupt end.

However, he could sense that although the collision just now seemed evenly matched on the surface, in reality, the True Phoenix Fire was slightly inferior. His own Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power appeared to be just a bit stronger than the True Phoenix Fire.

This discovery filled Yang Kai’s heart with excitement.

At that moment, he gritted his teeth and urged his Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power to surge forward.

Caught off guard, the True Phoenix Fire was wrapped up completely. Enraged, it screeched incessantly, struggling madly, its violent power utterly terrifying.

Yang Kai quickly formed seals with both hands. The Xuan Realm Pearl had already been summoned, and the mouth of the realm opened leisurely, directly drawing the True Phoenix Fire into the Small Xuan Realm.

Immediately after, he mobilized the Small Xuan Realm’s world power to suppress it in a certain place.

Afterward, Yang Kai staggered back a few steps, his face pale and drenched in sweat, as if he had just been fished out of water.

He hurriedly immersed his mind into the Small Xuan Realm to check on the current state of the True Phoenix Fire. He found that although it was struggling fiercely, under the might of the world, it was completely unable to escape, which finally put his mind at ease.

His whole body felt utterly exhausted, and Yang Kai plopped down on the ground.

Taking something like the True Phoenix Fire into the Small Xuan Realm had nearly drained his Divine Sense in an instant. The consumption was even greater than bringing hundreds of Incarnations inside, which showed just how heaven-defying the True Phoenix Fire was.

Still, things had gone so smoothly that it surprised him. He had only been trying it out, yet succeeded in one go. The credit for this was mostly due to his Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power. Without it to suppress the True Phoenix Fire, Yang Kai figured that even with the Small Xuan Realm, he would not have been able to take it away.

In this world, how could a top-ranked supreme Origin Power be so easily taken away?

Suddenly, a figure appeared not far away, looking pale as he stared at the cross-legged, equally pale Yang Kai, his face full of disbelief.

Qi Hai!

No one had expected that while everyone else went after the Mountain and River Bell, Qi Hai had actually used a concealment technique to quietly hide himself.

However, when the two Origin Powers clashed earlier, he was also affected a bit. Judging by his complexion, he seemed to have suffered some minor injuries. He probably knew his whereabouts had been exposed, so he simply stopped hiding and revealed himself openly.

He looked at Yang Kai with a complicated gaze but did not approach immediately, nor did he show any hostility. He just stood there quietly.

Although Yang Kai was meditating to recover, he still kept a bit of attention on Qi Hai’s movements. This guy’s cunning was a surprise to him. If not for the muffled groan Qi Hai let out when he was injured earlier, Yang Kai would not have realized there was anyone else here besides himself.

The reason Qi Hai secretly stayed behind was clearly because he had some hidden agenda. Yang Kai guessed it was very likely related to the True Phoenix Fire. Or perhaps Qi Hai had long known that the Mountain and River Bell was suppressing the True Phoenix Fire below, so he did not chase after the bell.

For a while, the two were silent. This dark red star seemed to be cooling rapidly because the True Phoenix Fire had been taken away. The temperature around them dropped sharply, and the difference in heat caused cracking sounds to echo continuously.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes.

Half an hour of meditation was not enough to fully restore his depleted Divine Sense, but he was no longer so fatigued. He still had the Warm Spirit Lotus, which constantly nourished his Divine Soul, so there was no need to deliberately recover his Divine Sense.

He turned his head and gave Qi Hai a meaningful look.

This guy had been standing here the whole time, neither disturbing his recovery nor showing any intention of leaving. Who knew what he was thinking?

Still, Yang Kai could tell he truly had no hostility. On the contrary, after witnessing Yang Kai’s astonishing feat just now, his eyes were filled with deep wariness.

Seeing Yang Kai look his way, Qi Hai straightened up and cautiously cupped his fists, saying, “I am Qi Hai. I suppose you already know, friend. May I ask your esteemed surname and how I should address you?”

“Yang Kai!” Yang Kai did not bother to hide his name. He was not particularly famous at the moment, certainly not compared to the top disciples of the great Sects, so there was no harm in giving his real name.

“So it’s Brother Yang. A pleasure, a pleasure!” Qi Hai cupped his fists again, his heart full of doubt. He kept recalling the names of elite disciples from the Four Great Territories’ major Sects in the Star Realm, but none matched Yang Kai.

Yang Kai asked calmly, “Does Brother Qi Hai have some business with me?”

Qi Hai gave an awkward smile and said, “Indeed, I do have a small request..."

Yang Kai snorted, “If it’s an unreasonable request, then don’t ask.”

“Uh...” Qi Hai was momentarily at a loss for words. He had only said that out of politeness, but did not expect Yang Kai to respond so bluntly, leaving him quite helpless.

“I am rather curious,” Yang Kai said calmly, looking at Qi Hai. “Everyone else went after the Mountain and River Bell, so why did Brother Qi Hai quietly stay behind? Did you already know something?”

Thinking about it now, Qi Hai was well-read and knowledgeable about many secrets others did not know. Earlier, he had revealed information about those Great Emperors. If he knew some story but did not share it, it was understandable.

Qi Hai raised his eyebrows and asked in return, “What about you, Brother Yang? You came back—did you know something too?”

Yang Kai replied blandly, “I just suddenly had a stomachache and came back to relieve myself!”

Qi Hai’s face went black.

Yang Kai continued, “Brother Qi Hai, you were hiding nearby. Didn’t you see me dig a big pit in the ground as soon as I returned? I was planning to take care of business there, but then all this happened!”

Qi Hai’s mouth twitched. “Brother Yang, you really have good luck!”

He looked utterly unconvinced, but Yang Kai did not mind at all. He just chuckled and said, “Brother Qi, if you know something, why not share it? Things have already come to this, there’s no point in keeping secrets.”

Qi Hai’s face darkened, and after a long sigh, he nodded. “I do know a few things.”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. “I’m all ears.”

Qi Hai said, “I knew that the Mountain and River Bell was suppressing the True Phoenix Fire!”

Yang Kai asked in surprise, “That’s something I can’t figure out. Didn’t Origin Cauldron Great Emperor and Martial Flame Great Emperor join forces to deal with the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor? Why would Origin Cauldron Great Emperor use the Mountain and River Bell to suppress Martial Flame Great Emperor’s True Phoenix Fire? Were they enemies?”

Qi Hai shook his head. “Brother Yang, you’re mistaken. Origin Cauldron Great Emperor and Martial Flame Great Emperor were indeed companions and did join forces against the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. But the reason Origin Cauldron Great Emperor used the Mountain and River Bell to suppress the True Phoenix Fire wasn’t because they were enemies—there was another reason entirely.”

“I’d like to hear the details,” Yang Kai said solemnly.

Qi Hai pondered for a moment before speaking. “The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was unmatched, his abilities rivaled creation itself. It’s no exaggeration to call him the greatest in the history of the Star Realm. But even though he was a Great Emperor, he was not truly immortal. In his era, his cultivation was unsurpassed, but he still wanted more. Brother Yang, can you guess what someone at his level would desire?”

Yang Kai was no fool. After hearing Qi Hai’s words, how could he not guess? His eyes flashed as he exclaimed, “Eternal life?”

Qi Hai nodded. “Exactly. The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor wanted to live as long as heaven and earth, to shine as bright as the sun and moon!”

Yang Kai drew a sharp breath. “What an appetite.”

Qi Hai chuckled. “You and I are far from that realm. If we had the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s abilities, perhaps we’d consider such things too. But achieving true immortality is no easy feat. Legend has it there is a supreme treasure of heaven and earth, formed at the dawn of creation before chaos was divided. It is called the Everlasting Tree!”

Yang Kai’s eyelid twitched slightly.

Qi Hai continued, “It’s said that if one obtains the Everlasting Tree, one can achieve immortality!”

Yang Kai burst out laughing. “Such a rumor—does Brother Qi really believe it?”

Qi Hai looked at him solemnly. “Why not believe it?”

Yang Kai said seriously, “A single tree can make someone immortal? That’s just a story to fool children. Brother Qi Hai, you’re a grown man, don’t fall for such nonsense.”

Qi Hai shook his head. “In this world, things that rival creation are rare, and each has unimaginable effects. The Everlasting Tree truly can grant immortality.”

Yang Kai looked surprised. “Is that really so? Then does Brother Qi Hai know how to use the Everlasting Tree to become immortal?”

Qi Hai gave a bitter smile. “That I do not know. The Everlasting Tree is not something easily seen. Throughout the ages, I doubt more than five people have ever laid eyes on it.”

Yang Kai thought to himself that was nonsense. When he obtained the Everlasting Tree, at least six or seven people saw it.

Still, the fact that Qi Hai did not know how to use the Everlasting Tree disappointed him. He had thought Qi Hai’s vast knowledge might yield some information about it.

Back when he obtained the Everlasting Tree, he had tried to refine it to achieve immortality.

But no matter how hard he tried, he found himself unable to refine even a bit of the Everlasting Tree. Back then, he was only at the Origin Returning Realm, so he could blame it on his low strength. But now, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he still could not refine it.

The greatest use of the Everlasting Tree now was to bring vitality to the Small Xuan Realm, allowing the Spiritual Herbs in the medicine garden to grow faster and shortening their growth cycles. Occasionally, Yang Kai could use the rich vitality emitted by the Everlasting Tree to heal injuries. Other than that, it had no other use. As for achieving immortality, Yang Kai had not the slightest clue.
