## Chapter 383 — This Time You Must Have Miscalculated

"I understand," Yang Kai said, feeling a shiver run down his spine at Tang Yuxian's serious demeanor. He silently rejoiced for not hastily absorbing it earlier.

Only after expressing the potential drawbacks did Tang Yuxian hand the small piece of jade back to Yang Kai, saying, "Young Master, keep this safe and don't let others know about it, or it might attract the covetous eyes of strong cultivators."

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded; with the black book space, it was quite convenient to hide things.

Tu Feng grinned, chuckling silently and oddly. "It seems the Lü Family has suffered a great loss this time."

Regardless of what price Yang Kai paid to exchange for the Yang Crystal Jade Bed from Lü Si, it was evident that he had greatly benefited.

Tang Yuxian also smiled delicately, "They probably didn't expect there would be a True Spirit inside."

The True Spirit had already gained some awareness and could deceive most experts' Divine Sense investigations. Previously, it had been hiding within the Yang Crystal Jade Bed, and likely Lü Si hadn’t noticed either; otherwise, he would never have handed it over to Yang Kai.

"Hmph, the Lü Family is quite shortsighted to dare monitor the Young Master's whereabouts. Such people are not worth befriending!" Tu Feng scoffed lightly. "Both Yu Xian and I have already recovered from our injuries. Young Master, when do you plan to leave here?"

"Let’s leave tomorrow." Yang Kai had no intention of staying with the Lü Family for long. He had only delayed his journey to wait for the two Blood Servants to heal and absorb the energy from the Yang Jade.

It had been many years since he left home, and he was eager to return and see his parents.

"Good, I will inform Miss Qiu. She seemed to indicate she wanted to join us." Tang Yuxian nodded.

The news of Yang Kai's departure from the Lü Family quickly spread.

Lü Liang and the others vaguely felt relieved. For some reason, while Yang Kai was there, they felt uneasy, as if they feared that other Yang Family young masters might learn of their contact with him.

That evening, Lü Liang hosted a banquet to entertain Yang Kai, Qiu Yimeng, and others.

During the feast, everyone discussed trivial matters. They omitted topics concerning the Yang Family's succession conflict and the future status of Zhongdu completely.

Qiu Yimeng observed with cold detachment, aware that the Lü Family was thoroughly pessimistic about Yang Kai. She chose not to say much, leaving early just as she did last time after consuming a little food.

However, Yang Kai feasted heartily, not mentioning anything about befriending the Lü Family. Drinking wine, eating meat, and savoring fruit delicacies, his composure eased the tension for Lü Liang and the others.

They genuinely feared that he might bring up something important at the last moment, and if he did, Lü Liang wouldn’t know how to respond.

The wine was the same as before, but unlike the previous occasion when Lü Liang hosted Yang Kai, the attitudes of the Lü Family had subtly shifted.

As the banquet concluded and people departed to rest, the next day, the senior members of the Lü Family, led by Lü Liang, came to send Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng off at the main gate.

Lü Liang wore a sincere expression as he looked at Yang Kai and said, "Young Master Yang, this trip to Zhongdu is fraught with dangers, and the succession struggle cannot be taken lightly."

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Lü Liang smiled and said, "It's rare for Young Master Yang to visit the Lü Family. Lü has nothing to offer except a little silver to express my appreciation. I hope you won't think much of it."

Saying this, he smiled and nodded to someone beside him.

That person hurried forward, holding a box of silver notes, offering it with both hands.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's expressions darkened. They both felt somewhat displeased and looked at Yang Kai, awaiting his instruction.

Yang Kai paid it no mind, chuckling, "The Lü Family's master is just being overly polite, so I shall graciously accept! Tu Feng, take it."

"Understood!" Tu Feng nodded lightly and took the box of silver notes.

"The Lü Family wishes Young Master Yang great success in the succession struggle and fruitful achievements!" Lü Liang clasped his fists lightly, uttering some polite words.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, "Then I will borrow the Lü Family's auspicious words. Farewell!"

Saying this, he mounted the Treading Cloud Steed and led the way. Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian followed closely behind him.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman also rode on the Treading Cloud Steeds prepared by the Lü Family for them. After moving a few steps, Qiu Yimeng paused and softly said, "Lü Liang, I'm afraid you must have miscalculated this time!"

Lü Liang's expression shifted slightly, and just as he was about to speak, Qiu Yimeng had already urged her Treading Cloud Steed to fly away at high speed.

The expressions of those from the Lü Family turned sour.

"Miscalculated?" Lü Liang frowned, pondering the meaning behind Qiu Yimeng's last remark. It was clear she was reproaching him for underestimating Yang Kai.

But… even if you are the young lady of the Qiu Family, after all, you are still just a youth and a woman! In terms of foresight and strategy, how could you compare to an old man like me?

Although Lü Liang felt somewhat uncomfortable, he didn't take Qiu Yimeng's words to heart.

Let time prove whether I have miscalculated!

……

The five Treading Cloud Steeds sped forward, and Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman slowly caught up.

After leaving the Lü Family, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's faces remained stormy, feeling quite displeased for Yang Kai.

When they left, Lü Liang appeared sincere and generous, but everyone present understood his true thoughts.

If the Lü Family truly intended to befriend Yang Kai, they wouldn't simply offer a bit of money at the last moment!

What does the succession struggle rely on? It relies on the connections, networks, and means of various young masters.

More specifically, it's about talent and resources!

If the Lü Family genuinely wanted to participate in the power struggle, they would at least need to stand firmly with Yang Kai, contributing some talented individuals, heavenly treasures, divine weapons, and martial arts scriptures or the like.

Giving a small amount of silver alone means nothing. In this world, sometimes, having money doesn't guarantee you can acquire things, especially not good things, which cannot be resolved with wealth alone.

Although Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had been by Yang Kai's side for a short time, they could see Yang Kai's exceptional talent and profound cultivation.

Both were equally confident about Yang Kai's future.

The Lü Family's blatant disregard for Yang Kai would make it strange if the two Blood Servants felt comfortable with it.

They just couldn't understand… since the Lü Family did not plan to stand by Yang Kai's side, why offer silver for goodwill at the end? This undoubtedly gave the impression that they wished to befriend him but were unwilling to put their family on the line, trying to play both sides.

Only Yang Kai understood that Lü Liang was extending this favor because of his connection with Xiao Fusheng. Without Xiao Fusheng's involvement, Lü Liang likely wouldn't have given anything at the last moment.

Noticing the discomfort of the two Blood Servants, Qiu Yimeng rolled her eyes and said, "If you have something to say, just say it. Why hold it back?"

Tu Feng pursed his lips and angrily said, "Then I'll say it. Miss Qiu, you might as well take it in one ear and let it out the other."

"Yes, go ahead. I want to hear too!" 

"Young Master!" Tu Feng raised his voice, "I took a look, and Lü Liang's silver notes are exactly three million taels. He's really too stingy!"

"How much do you want?" Yang Kai turned his head to look at him, laughing dumbfoundingly.

"The Lü Family is a prestigious family; how can they only give three million taels? That amount just for a few bottles of decent pills would be gone in an instant. It wouldn't even buy a couple of good treasures. At the very least, they should give ten million taels. That would match the Lü Family's status and have a bit of weight!"

"Exactly, too stingy!" Tang Yuxian nodded in agreement.

"Three million taels is already a considerable amount," Yang Kai chuckled. "Don't be embarrassed, but I currently have no money at all. This three million taels is quite useful for me."

"That money seems like a lot, but when the time comes for the succession struggle, it won't be much use," Tu Feng said indignantly. "Lü Liang clearly knows this too. If it weren't for his connections with Miss Qiu's family, I'd definitely want to beat him up and shove that silver note down his throat!"

Qiu Yimeng shook her head with a wry smile, "Lü Liang is indeed overly cautious this time. However… it isn’t entirely his fault. It's because your young master has been acting too much!"

"What do you mean? How is this the young master’s fault?" Tang Yuxian was taken aback.

"You should ask him; he knows exactly how he has behaved during his time at the Lü Family," Qiu Yimeng said, urging her Treading Cloud Steed to catch up a few steps, turning her head to look at Yang Kai. "You, you know what the current situation is, right? Why are you still so indifferent and allowing the Lü Family's support to slip right away from you?"

Yang Kai glanced at her and then turned his gaze away.

"I'm talking to you!" Qiu Yimeng was so exasperated she rolled her eyes. "What you've let go is not just an ally; it's also creating an enemy for yourself. Do you understand? This back and forth will create a huge disparity."

"Ally?" Yang Kai sneered, "Those merely trying to establish an interest relationship with me are unworthy to be my allies!"

"But where is there an alliance without an interest relationship? Don't you think that's too naive?"

"I don't need others to evaluate my actions!"

Qiu Yimeng was left speechless by his retort. Out of irritation, she blurted, "Just wait, when I return, I will definitely collaborate with the other Yang Family young masters to suppress your arrogance!"

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were immediately alarmed, quickly saying, "Miss Qiu, you can't say that."

Yang Kai, however, only laughed coldly, "You can try, but don't blame me for expelling your Qiu Family from Zhongdu!"

Qiu Yimeng was stunned, staring blankly at Yang Kai, seemingly not expecting him to say something so harsh.

Even Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were taken aback, feeling that Yang Kai's words were indeed somewhat overbearing, which was rather hurtful.

Just as they were uneasy and wanted to say a few good things for Yang Kai, trying to comfort Qiu Yimeng, she soon regained her composure, and far from being upset, she looked at Yang Kai with interest shining in her beautiful eyes. "Yang Kai, tell me honestly, besides that weirdo, how many connections do you have that you can actually use? How many forces can you rally?"

Seeing Yang Kai's rampant attitude, Qiu Yimeng immediately sensed something was off, which was why she was so intrigued.

Casting her a glance, Yang Kai scoffed lightly and said indifferently, "None. I am just a lone wolf!"

"Believe you, and I'll be a pig!" Qiu Yimeng replied with a sarcastic smile. (To be continued...)
