## Chapter 1770 — Chance Encounter

The Space Blade collided with the Jingkong Beast's Void Roar in the emptiness.

Explosions and crashes rang without end as a wild burst of Spatial Force erupted; ten chi in front of Yang Kai the space suddenly collapsed. That patch of void seemed like a wall shattered to pieces, fragmenting in an instant as chaotic currents of power surged and sprayed the nothingness.

From the collapsed space the Jingkong Beast's enormous body twisted out in a strange motion, gaping and lunging to bite at Yang Kai.

It took advantage of Yang Kai's momentary distraction and brazenly closed the distance.

Yang Kai, however, appeared to have anticipated this and showed no panic; his foot shifted ever so slightly, his body wrapped in Spatial Force and gradually blurred into a phantom.

The Jingkong Beast snapped at empty air!

The next instant Yang Kai had already materialized above the Jingkong Beast like a specter, every ounce of his cultivation condensed into a single punch that crashed down upon its skull.

Boom……

The fist burst forth with force and the Jingkong Beast was smashed to pieces.

Yet Yang Kai felt no triumphant joy; instead his brow knit as he hastily dodged aside, for the moment he moved the Jingkong Beast that ought to have been shattered reappeared behind him, gaping wide once more.

The Jingkong Beast Yang Kai had smashed a moment ago had merely been its afterimage!

Man and beast moved at the very limit of speed; using Spatial Force like this was enough to fog an opponent's sight.

A shadow flickered and Yang Kai reappeared a hundred zhang away, while the Jingkong Beast hung suspended in the void, precisely locating him and staring his way.

A short clash — a first probe — had told both combatants that the other was not a soft target to be toyed with.

"If that's the case…" Yang Kai murmured, curling his lips into a smile, "then don't blame me for being unrighteous!"

As he spoke he waved his hand.

The next instant the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao and the Artifact Spirit Liu Yan appeared like two brilliant trump cards.

The Stone Puppet hoisted the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, its small, stooped form waddling while its eyes rolled about as though it did not know where it was. Liu Yan emerged with a leisurely grace and immediately addressed Yang Kai, "Master, any orders?"

"Kill it!" Yang Kai pointed toward the Jingkong Beast a hundred zhang away.

Liu Yan's beautiful eyes fixed on the Jingkong Beast; her expression grew serious as she said in a low voice, "It looks rather formidable."

Yang Kai laughed aloud. "If it weren't, I could handle it myself. Why would I call you two out? Yes, it's proficient in Spatial Force, so you must cooperate with me."

“As the Master commands!” Liu Yan nodded, a flame suddenly igniting in her delicate hand. The fire was a purplish-red, threaded with faint arcs of electricity; a ferocious power surged forth.

"Then begin." Yang Kai grinned; as he shifted his form he once more charged the Jingkong Beast, coordinating with his two superlative aids. No words were necessary — whether Stone Puppet or Artifact Spirit, they shared a mental link with Yang Kai and could read his intent to achieve perfect teamwork.

The moment Yang Kai moved, Liu Yan dissolved into a blaze and streaked after him.

The Stone Puppet suddenly swelled into a Stone Giant, dragging the ten-zhang-long Heaven-Shaking Pillar, walking step by deliberate step through the void as it slowly advanced.

The Jingkong Beast clearly possessed considerable intelligence, and when it saw Yang Kai's two unexpected helpers its small eyes betrayed a puzzled, unsettled look.

Seeing Yang Kai and Liu Yan charge together, it leapt in place and vaulted forward; the void before it became like the surface of a lake — once it passed through that face the beast's body vanished entirely.

Yang Kai's eyes shone as he sensed the surrounding space changing; in the next instant he issued an order to the slowly advancing Stone Puppet.

The Stone Puppet did not hesitate, roaring a thunderous cry as it swung the Heaven-Shaking Pillar toward its left.

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar weighed hundreds of thousands of jin, and coupled with the Stone Puppet's world-destroying fury, that blow could pulverize even space itself. At the moment the pillar swept across, the Jingkong Beast's head just happened to appear in its path.

It looked as if the Jingkong Beast had deliberately presented itself to be struck.

The Jingkong Beast had intended to strike the Stone Puppet first, but Yang Kai had read its trick and turned it against the beast.

At such close range and with so hasty an assault, even the Jingkong Beast's mastery of Spatial Force could not save it.

If that blow landed, even if the Jingkong Beast's strength equaled a Void King Realm, it would be ground to paste — the Stone Puppet's full-strength strike was no joke.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened as he secretly anticipated the spraying of gore.

To his astonishment, facing a seemingly fatal strike the Jingkong Beast forcibly twisted its body; from within it a thick surge of Spatial Force billowed forth and transformed into a void whirlpool that blocked the Stone Puppet's attack.

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar smashed the whirlpool to pieces; the residual force swept across the Jingkong Beast and, accompanied by spurting blood, sent it flying a thousand zhang!

At the joint between its head and neck the flesh was mangled and bone could be seen pale and exposed.

Yet it had survived, and the wound was not as grievous as it had appeared.

"I knew it wouldn't be so easy!" Yang Kai gritted his teeth and, waving his hand, unleashed Saint Yuan. Wrapped with Liu Yan, he pierced the void and instantaneously came to the injured Jingkong Beast.

In the next instant master and servant launched a frenzied assault upon the Jingkong Beast.

Hundreds of Golden Blood Threads poured Spatial Force into the void to weave a net that sealed off that vast patch of space, cutting off the Jingkong Beast's escape. Yang Kai himself furiously drove the Space Blade, firing it at the beast.

Liu Yan's attack was simpler: wave after wave of fire laced with lightning clustered around the Jingkong Beast like drifting flowers. Each thunder-flame blossom hid terrifying power; any contact charred the beast's hide and tiny arcs of lightning danced over its body, hampering its movements.

For a time the Jingkong Beast was driven to nothing but evasion, powerless to retaliate, howling continuously.

Deng deng deng deng……

Shrouded in icy aura, the Stone Puppet charged forward. Working in concert with Yang Kai and Liu Yan’s restraining attacks, it raised the Heaven-Shaking Pillar high once more and brought it crashing down toward the Jingkong Beast.

At that strike the Jingkong Beast's eyes flashed with terror.

It did not fear Yang Kai and Liu Yan's methods so much as it dreaded the Stone Puppet's raw force — a violence capable of subduing ten opponents at once — a power its spatial arts could not dispel.

The Jingkong Beast howled and fought back, continuously unleashing its Void Roar secret technique to form a dense volley at Yang Kai and Liu Yan; at the same time another spatial barrier manifested on its body, taking the Stone Puppet's blow head-on.

The crack of bone echoed, and the Jingkong Beast's terrifying aura sagged for an instant.

In such a short time it had suffered too many strikes and was badly wounded; facing the wolfish onslaught of Yang Kai and his companion, it realized it could not win — if it did not flee, it might well die here.

Desperately it drove its Spatial Force to warp the surrounding void.

The hundreds of Golden Blood Threads Yang Kai had scattered around were disturbed and could no longer hold steady; flaws appeared.

Liu Yan cried out in alarm as lightning-fire spread over her, carefully guarding against the Jingkong Beast's counterattack.

Taking advantage of the moment, the Jingkong Beast leapt away and in an instant escaped dozens of zhang, breaking out of Yang Kai and his companion's encirclement.

"Trying to run!" Yang Kai snorted coldly and prepared to pursue, but the Jingkong Beast repeated its trick and plunged into the void before him, vanishing from sight.

Yang Kai frowned and pushed his Spatial Force to the limit, yet he could detect no trace of the beast nearby. Soon he realized with a start, "It actually escaped!"

The Jingkong Beast had clearly escaped beyond the rupture in the void, which was why he could not sense it here.

Without hesitation he withdrew the Stone Puppet and Liu Yan, shifted his footing, and arrived where the Jingkong Beast had disappeared; thrusting his hands into the void, he ripped it sharply to either side.

A rift opened leisurely!

Yang Kai dove straight through.

In the next instant he returned to the Lost Realm.

Yang Kai immediately began searching for the Jingkong Beast; such a strange ancient demonic beast could flit through the void, and if one did not pursue it promptly it was easily lost.

The beast's howl came to his ears, tinged with panic, as though something were tormenting it.

Yang Kai frowned and followed the sound; what he saw made his face change.

Not far ahead, a vast black shroud covered the sky and concealed the land, enveloping an enormous stretch of space. Within that darkness, countless human faces writhed and twisted, shifting in and out of shape. Those faces seemed like Yin Souls, and the area encased by the shroud appeared to be a gathering ground for such spirits, exuding a sinister and chilling aura.

Through the curtain Yang Kai vaguely saw the Jingkong Beast's massive form; now it was surrounded by innumerable Yin-Soul-like things, countless faces suctioned to its body and biting into its flesh.

Visibly the Jingkong Beast's flesh began to shrivel, as if those Yin-Souls were draining its essence. No matter how it struggled it could not free itself from the black shroud.

It had clearly reached the end of the road!

"Heh heh heh heh…" a grotesque laugh suddenly came from nearby.

Yang Kai's face grew grim as he quietly stirred his Saint Yuan and warily looked toward the source of the sound.

There, a figure draped entirely in shadow stood motionless; within the darkness a pair of eyes that chilled the blood seemed to be surveying Yang Kai.

"It's you!" Yang Kai hissed, his expression turning grave.
