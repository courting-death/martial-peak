## Chapter 2360 — The Eerie Island

If one could look down from high above Jixu Ridge, they would see the entire ridge spinning like a top around a single center. The whole of Jixu Ridge took on the shape of a massive funnel, and a powerful devouring force emanated from that center, affecting every living being within the ridge.

Countless birds and beasts were sucked into the giant vortex at the heart of the funnel, vanishing in the blink of an eye; even more birds, beasts, and martial artists training here for resources exploded into blood mist, leaving no trace behind.

Those martial artists who happened to be operating on the outskirts were luckier. In the face of this sudden change, they managed to escape, but when they looked back, every face was pale, their hearts still pounding with lingering fear.

Many people had no idea what was happening, but some recognized it as the famous Great Jixu Whirlpool. The news spread quickly, and soon everyone knew of it. While marveling at the terrifying power of nature, they were also filled with anticipation.

Because every time the Great Jixu Whirlpool appeared, the entire Jixu Ridge would be reshaped, and some heaven-and-earth treasures that had been deep within the ridge would be swept out to the periphery as the terrain changed.

In other words, once the commotion in Jixu Ridge settled, a large number of heaven-and-earth treasures would appear on the outskirts. How could they not look forward to that?

"I think I saw the City Lord enter the depths of Jixu Ridge earlier. Maybe I was seeing things."

"No, I saw it too. The City Lord was moving in a hurry, as if chasing someone."

"Now the City Lord is in trouble. Who knows if he’ll make it back safely."

"Not likely. The depths of Jixu Ridge are already extremely dangerous. Even someone in the Emperor Realm like the City Lord might not come out unscathed. Now, with the Great Jixu Whirlpool, the odds are even worse!"

Many martial artists gathered far from the outskirts of Jixu Ridge, discussing the situation. If Pang Guang really perished in Jixu Ridge this time, the power structure of Gao City would have to be reshuffled. For many, this was good news. For a while, some rejoiced while others worried, and everyone’s feelings were complicated.

Meanwhile, deep within Jixu Ridge, Yang Kai shielded Liu Qianyun, struggling to withstand the terrifying suction from the center. His clothes were shredded to rags, his skin cracked, and he was covered in blood, looking utterly miserable.

The suction from the depths only grew more terrifying the more he resisted. The force pressing down on Yang Kai made him feel increasingly exhausted.

If not for his strong physique, he would have exploded and died like the other living beings.

"Senior Brother, don’t worry about me. Save yourself." Although Liu Qianyun was also resisting, with Yang Kai’s protection, she was actually faring better than him. Seeing Yang Kai in such a state, she felt deeply guilty, knowing she was dragging him down.

As she spoke, she pushed off with her foot, trying to move away from Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught her wrist and gently shook his head, his voice low and steady: “Don’t worry. If I truly can’t hold on, I’ll let you know.”

At this life-and-death moment, Yang Kai still did not abandon her. Warmth surged through Liu Qianyun’s heart, moved beyond words. It is easy to share prosperity, but true character is revealed in adversity—only in hardship does one see a person’s heart.

Liu Qianyun felt that meeting Yang Kai in the Star Realm was the greatest luck of her life.

She quietly gave up resisting, showing a sorrowful smile. "Senior Brother, take care of yourself in the future!"

"What are you doing!" Yang Kai’s expression changed as he realized her intent and quickly shouted, "Don’t give up! I have other ways!"

Liu Qianyun slowly shook her head, letting herself be dragged by that terrifying force.

Yang Kai panicked, realizing Liu Qianyun was determined not to drag him down. He was about to throw her into the Small Xuan Realm at all costs when Liu Qianyun’s expression suddenly changed, becoming extremely strange.

The next moment, she cried out, "Senior Brother, don’t resist! There’s no danger at all if you don’t resist."

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s spirits lifted. He looked closely and saw that Liu Qianyun was indeed unharmed. Realizing she was telling the truth, he quickly released his own power and let the terrifying suction swirl around him.

The force that had been suppressing him and causing severe harm to his body instantly vanished.

Just as Liu Qianyun said, it was better not to resist this force—the more you resisted, the worse it felt.

But who wouldn’t resist in such a situation? Anyone would desperately try to escape, and once they did, death was near.

After giving up resistance, the powerful suction pulled Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun toward the center of Jixu Ridge. The surging force made Yang Kai feel like a lone boat in a raging sea, in danger of capsizing at any moment.

"Senior Brother, look!" Liu Qianyun clung tightly to Yang Kai’s arm, not caring at all that her ample chest was being squashed by his arm. Suddenly, she cried out in surprise.

Yang Kai turned to look, his face darkening. He saw a massive, pitch-black funnel ahead, where the suction was coming from. The ground nearby was churning, and countless birds and beasts were being sucked in, their fate unknown.

He wanted to release his Divine Sense to probe inside, but the moment it left his body, it was shredded, making his mind ache. He dared not try again.

Liu Qianyun grew even more nervous, her body trembling like a quail without a nest in winter. She didn’t know if she would live or die after being sucked into the vortex. She had only been in the Star Realm for a few years and was not willing to die so soon.

She glanced up at Yang Kai and saw that, though his face was grave, there was no sign of panic.

Her heart instantly steadied. She thought that even if she died, dying with Yang Kai wouldn’t be so bad. With that thought, her body relaxed a lot.

"Protect yourself," Yang Kai said softly, patting Liu Qianyun’s back.

As soon as he finished speaking, both he and Liu Qianyun were sucked into the vortex. Instantly, a wave of dizziness swept over him, making it impossible to tell direction. The world went completely dark, and not a trace of light remained.

Their bodies spun and fell endlessly, as if the bottom of the vortex was a bottomless pit, filling them with fear and uncertainty about when it would end.

But what reassured Yang Kai a little was that this fall wasn’t particularly dangerous.

Liu Qianyun clung to him even tighter, her whole body stiff as a board.

Who knows how long passed before Yang Kai suddenly saw a glimmer of light. But under the force of the vortex, he couldn’t recover and couldn’t see his surroundings clearly.

Bang…

With a loud crash, Yang Kai’s whole body was wracked with pain, as if he were about to shatter. But instead of fear, he felt joy, because he realized he had landed on solid ground. The vortex’s force vanished, leaving only a piercing howling in his ears.

Bang, bang, bang…

Things kept crashing down around him, some even covering him. The air smelled of earth and flesh—an unbearable stench.

Yang Kai didn’t dare move recklessly, afraid of more changes. He cautiously circulated his Origin Qi to protect himself and Liu Qianyun, finding that his Origin Qi flowed freely and didn’t provoke any strange backlash. He relaxed a little.

Liu Qianyun seemed to have fainted, showing no sign of movement, but her breathing was steady and smooth, clearly unharmed.

Only after half an hour did the commotion around them gradually subside. Yang Kai waited a bit longer, and after making sure there was no danger, he used his Origin Qi to blast away the dirt and debris covering him, shooting up from beneath a mound.

He landed lightly, first checking on Liu Qianyun and confirming she had indeed fainted. Only then did he begin to survey his surroundings.

What he saw left Yang Kai stunned.

He realized he was on an island.

The island wasn’t very large, only a few li across. Judging by the color of the soil and the debris, it was clearly a newly formed island.

The soil here was exactly the same as that deep within Jixu Ridge, and there were many pieces of bird and beast corpses and blood on the island, giving it a bizarre, crimson hue.

This island was definitely formed by the upheaval in Jixu Ridge. When the vortex-like force spun, it brought the land from Jixu Ridge here, creating this island!

All around the island was a boundless sea, with fierce waves.

What shocked Yang Kai even more was the strange sight of dragon-like waterspouts rising from the sea. Pillars of water soared from the surface, piercing the clouds, connecting heaven and earth with overwhelming momentum!

There were countless such waterspouts on the sea, large and small, each radiating a powerful suction that felt extremely dangerous.

They weren’t stationary, but constantly moving—some fast, some slow, their speeds varied greatly. The faster ones flashed past Yang Kai’s vision like lightning, raising towering waves and causing astonishing destruction.

He sensed the Spiritual Qi and found it extremely dense, yet somehow different from elsewhere.

What kind of place was this?

How did coming through the giant vortex in the depths of Jixu Ridge bring him here?

It couldn’t be the underground of Jixu Ridge—this place was vast, with a boundless sea. How could it be underground?

Could this be a secret realm? Yang Kai was startled.

The more he thought about it, the more it made sense. When he was being swallowed by the vortex, he clearly sensed traces of spatial teleportation. That massive vortex was likely the entrance to this secret realm!

If this really was a secret realm, things would be troublesome. In this endless sea, where was he supposed to find an exit?
