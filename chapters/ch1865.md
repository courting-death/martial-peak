## Chapter 1865 — What Did You Say?

After handling the matters in the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai's spirit returned to his body, and he slowly opened his eyes.

Casting a faint glance at Zi Wuji standing to one side, Yang Kai said, "Second Young Master, please sit."

Although he had been dealing with the Small Xuan Realm just now, he had sensed Zi Wuji's arrival, so he was not the least bit surprised.

Seeing him so amiable, Zi Wuji's face brightened and he hurriedly said, "Before you, Venerable One, Wuji may stand and speak."

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at him and said unhurriedly, “Young Master Wuji, you are, after all, the Second Young Master of Purple Star. With your status, speaking while standing like this seems rather inappropriate.”

Zi Wuji then cupped his fist and said with neither humility nor arrogance, "If that's the case, then allow me to be presumptuous before the Venerable One."

As he spoke, he sat down opposite Yang Kai, took up the teapot and poured a cup for him, appearing exceedingly attentive.

Yang Kai gave a slight smile and said, "This Venerable One must first thank the Second Young Master for secretly relieving the situation earlier."

Zi Wuji froze for a moment, then quickly understood what Yang Kai was referring to. He hurriedly said, “Venerable One, you overestimate the matter. Jiang Chao is nothing but a petty clown. To dare offend a Venerable—he deserved ten thousand deaths. I did instruct Deputy Commander Qu Zheng to detain him, but the Great Elder’s influence is overwhelming. In the end they still managed to spirit him away, and he received no real punishment.”

Yang Kai let out a light chuckle. “As the Second Young Master said, Jiang Chao is nothing more than a petty clown. Why would I bother lowering myself to his level?”

Zi Wuji immediately cupped his fist, "You are magnanimous, Venerable One; I admire you."

Yang Kai waved his hand, "Enough small talk. Second Young Master, I heard you instructed Li Nuo to arrange this secretly. What do you want with me?"

Zi Wuji's expression turned serious as he began, "I heard that Purple Star has a Third Venerable One; such strength is Purple Star's good fortune—truly admirable..."

"Get to the point!"

Zi Wuji’s voice cut off abruptly. After a long moment of thinking, he suddenly rose to his feet and bowed deeply to the floor. “Zi Wuji humbly beseeches the Venerable One to aid me in taking control of Purple Star!”

His expression was resolute and his voice rang out with force, but after uttering those words beads of sweat the size of soybeans appeared on his forehead. It was obvious—he was terrified and had struggled greatly within.

After he finished, he received no response; Zi Wuji covertly raised his head and saw Yang Kai smiling at him, that smile full of meaning. Though there was no oppressive force in his gaze, it pierced like a sword, seeming to probe into his very heart.

Zi Wuji's heart jolted. A sudden feeling that his secrets had been seen through swept over him; he grit his teeth and shouted, "Venerable One, please lend Wuji a hand!"

"How dare you!" Yang Kai slammed the table, his tone icy cold.

Zi Wuji shivered all over and stared at Yang Kai in bewilderment.

Yang Kai sneered, "Second Young Master, I did not expect you to be so brazenly treasonous! Since you know I am the Purple Star's Venerable One, you should know a Venerable One stands above all others, and at times represents the Purple Star's Lord. To say such things in my presence—are you trying to overthrow your Father's rule and force me to take action against you?"

Zi Wuji said, "Venerable One, calm your anger. As Purple Star's Second Young Master, Wuji understands such rules. It's just that..."

"Just what?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and said. His Domain Field wrapped around him, giving the impression that if he dared speak again the killing would begin.

Sweat fell like raindrops from Zi Wuji's forehead; for the first time he felt the breath of death. Under Yang Kai's Domain Field, he almost lost the ability to think and fell to his knees.

At the critical moment, he bit his tongue to clear his mind for an instant and said in a low voice, "If it were ordinary times, Wuji would never have these presumptuous thoughts. Purple Star has been controlled by my Zi family for generations; my Father, Zi Long, was one of the overlords of the realm whom I most respected and worshipped—how dare I be disrespectful to him? But... Father has already fallen, my Eldest Brother is nowhere to be found, and Purple Star cannot be without a leader. If Wuji does not stand up now, who will?"

"What did you just say?" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as he stared at Zi Wuji, real killing intent stirring in his heart.

He had never imagined that Zi Wuji actually knew Zi Long had already fallen.

Although he did not know by what means he had learned it, judging from the other's demeanor and tone, it was not a guess but a certainty.

But apart from Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor, no one else knew this—how did Zi Wuji know? Yang Kai could not fathom it no matter how he thought.

Zi Wuji seemed to calm considerably; his speech became clearer and he looked at Yang Kai's eyes unafraid, saying, "Venerable One need not hide it from Wuji. A few days after my Father fell, Wuji learned of it."

After saying that he gave an embarrassed laugh, "You must wonder how Wuji knew. It's simple: my Father had one Life Lamp—while the lamp existed, the person lived; when the lamp was extinguished, the person was gone. The existence of that lamp was known to only one person under heaven—Wuji's mother! Even my Eldest Brother Zi Donglai did not know of the Life Lamp."

"A Life Lamp?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow; though he'd never heard of such a thing, he understood it was similar to the Ice Soul Pearl Su Yan once condensed—if the person lived, the pearl existed; if the person died, the pearl shattered.

"Correct." Zi Wuji nodded gravely. "Although my Father had many wives and concubines, his favorite was my mother, so this Life Lamp was kept by her. After the Life Lamp was broken, my mother told me."

"If Zi Long cared for your mother so much, why did he not groom you as his heir?" Yang Kai sneered.

Zi Wuji gave a bitter smile. “Venerable One, you haven’t been in Purple Star long, so you may not be fully aware of the situation. Purple Star is, of course, led by my Father. But beneath him, the Great Elder holds the greatest power. And my Eldest Brother’s mother… happens to be the Great Elder’s daughter.”

"I see it now." Yang Kai nodded slightly; after all, it was Zi Long's compromise. No wonder a scoundrel like Zi Donglai could become Purple Star's Young Master. Yang Kai had once thought Zi Long had spoiled him, but there were other reasons.

"You don't seem surprised by my Father's death; maybe you already knew?" Zi Wuji looked at Yang Kai and asked softly.

"What makes you say that?" Yang Kai retorted.

"Hehe, when Father previously took Eldest Brother out, they went to that fabled Lost Realm... it's treacherous and fraught with danger; even Father had no guarantee of returning unscathed. Father should have fallen there... and you appeared in Purple Star City shortly after—I had never heard of you before. I guessed you must have met Father in the Lost Realm, and that in the Lost Realm you became Purple Star's Third Venerable One. Perhaps you were present when Father fell, so today you are not surprised at all."

"That's a reasonable analysis!" Yang Kai nodded in approval, but the next moment his face turned cold and killing intent flashed from his brows, "But if I had killed Zi Long, the same result could have occurred—did you not consider that, Second Young Master?"

Zi Wuji's expression changed but he wasn't too flustered; he composed himself and said, "Wuji naturally considered it, but it shouldn’t be feasible. It’s not that I doubt your strength—since Father acknowledged you and entrusted you with the Command Token, your means must be extraordinary. Yet a figure like my father… even if you could kill him, I fear you wouldn’t escape unscathed. So his death likely has little to do with you.”

Zi Wuji's speculation was reasonable, though he greatly underestimated Yang Kai's power, and at that time the situation had not been a duel between Yang Kai and Zi Long alone; the Ghost Ancestor and the Incarnation had joined in the pincer attack.

"Furthermore, there's another more important reason—my Eldest Brother is still alive. If Father had truly been killed by you, Eldest Brother could not possibly have survived."

"Your Eldest Brother also has a Life Lamp?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Of course." Zi Wuji nodded.

Yang Kai felt a sudden, inexplicable wave of relief. Fortunately, Zi Donglai’s soul hadn’t been destroyed — otherwise, coming to Purple Star this time would’ve been nothing short of walking straight into a trap.

Thinking this, Yang Kai's expression grew affable; he sighed, "Second Young Master, you are clever! If I had been Zi Long, I would have groomed you as my successor!"

Zi Wuji's face lit up with joy and he modestly said, "You flatter me, Venerable One; Wuji is merely surviving by his wits."

Yang Kai let out a sigh. “You’re right. Zi Long did indeed fall in the Lost Realm. I met him there, and we even went through life-and-death together. He invited me to join Purple Star, and I accepted. But who could’ve expected that cursed place to harbor a Divine Bird — the Seven Luminaries Peacock? That beast is something only a Third Stage Void King can withstand. Your father was caught off guard and enveloped by its Seven-Luminaries Divine Light… and perished on the spot. I truly mourn his passing.”

Hearing Yang Kai say that, Zi Wuji broke into uncontrollable sobs, mourning unbearably, tears pouring down like strings of cut pearls...

Yang Kai looked at him coldly, inwardly full of admiration.

Zi Wuji was certainly a shrewd one. Though he wailed to the heavens as if his grief were boundless, it was precisely that overdone misery that made it look a bit contrived.

After all, this wasn’t the first he’d heard of his father’s death—he had already learned it when the Life Lamp went out. Putting on such a display before Yang Kai now was clearly part performance. And Yang Kai himself wasn’t entirely sure whether the man had actually believed the story he had just fabricated.

Regardless of whether he believed him, Yang Kai could only take things step by step for the moment.

After crying for a long while, Zi Wuji quieted his voice, wiped his tears and said in a trembling voice, "Forgive Wuji for making the Venerable One laugh."

"It's human nature, Second Young Master—accept my condolences!" Yang Kai patiently comforted.

"Venerable One, Wuji has one more thing unclear; I hope you will kindly enlighten me." Zi Wuji quickly recovered; it seemed he had turned grief into strength.

"Speak." Yang Kai said blandly.

"My Eldest Brother... where is he now?" Zi Wuji asked softly.
