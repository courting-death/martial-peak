## Chapter 733 — Ice Lord Qing Ya

A rough check showed that well over two hundred people were in this condition; regardless of cultivation or age, each and every one was like this — their life aura thrown into disarray. Even those Transcendent Realm elders within the sect had not escaped.

Sect disciples did not become like this for no reason; the only explanation was that they had fallen for this brat's sinister trick.

But what ability did he possess to do such a thing right under the noses of four Saint Realm experts? Qian Hao and the others all grew suspicious.

"You did this?" Qian Hao shot a glance at the other two Saint Realm experts and coldly fixed his gaze on Yang Kai.

"You tell me!" Yang Kai snapped back.

"What did you do to them? Why are they all in such agony?" Qian Hao demanded sternly.

Yang Kai chuckled, an utterly carefree smile playing across his face.

The two who had received Qian Hao's signal descended to investigate, and were astonished to find that none of these people bore the slightest wound, nor showed any sign of poisoning.

They exchanged baffled looks.

No poison, no injury — how had the disciples all come to be in this state?

Without further thought, the two hurriedly released their Divine Sense to examine the disciples more closely. Yet scarcely had their Divine Sense been sent forth when both men's faces changed and they cried out in alarm: "What is that?"

Crying out, they fled in disarray, as if something fearsome were pursuing them from behind.

Seeing this, both Qian Yue and Qian Hao felt a chill run down their spines, their bodies awash with cold dread.

"What's wrong with you?" Qian Yue called out in alarm.

"Don't come near! Don't use your Divine Sense to probe!" one of them cried, his face ashen as he fled, "There's something that targets Divine Sense — once it latches on you can't shake it off!"

At the same time, the other gave a sorrowful scream, his expression wracked with pain.

The two Saint Realm First Stage experts panicked as if struck by calamity; Qian Yue wished to help but did not know where to begin.

Qian Hao, however, cast a cold glance at Yang Kai, his face pensive; deep within his eyes a heavy apprehension showed as he quietly condensed his True Yuan.

This brat's methods were too strange — even First Stage Saint Realm cultivators had been harmed; he could not afford to be careless.

After a long while, the two Saint Realm experts gradually stabilized, though both were deathly pale, brows furrowed, expressions full of lingering fear.

"Kid, what exactly did you do here?" one of them asked, his expression changed from contempt to unease as he stifled the pain in his soul to speak.

"Well done maintaining your composure as a Saint Realm warrior," Yang Kai remarked with a smile, his expression light.

Not only had they remained conscious, their combat abilities were not diminished either — in other words, they were largely the same as before, merely burdened by anxieties.

"What is going on?" Qian Yue asked in horror. She knew full well the strength of these two elders; if even they had been afflicted, she herself would likely not have escaped.

"An imperceptible alien worm has spread through those disciples' Seas of Consciousness. Even when we probed with Divine Sense we were contaminated." One of them glared at Yang Kai with venom and slowly explained, "Although we've temporarily suppressed the worms, expelling them will take time, and with the disciples' current capabilities they can't achieve it."

"Alien worms?" Qian Yue's face drained of color. "What kind of worms?"

"Unclear — that's something we need to ask him!" the other replied.

Qian Hao inhaled lightly, hesitation written across his face. After a long moment he released the restraints on Yang Kai and said calmly, "Kid, you win. I'll free you first to show Ice Sect sincerity. Answer our questions obediently."

"A sensible man seizes the situation," Yang Kai sneered.

The four faces fell long at once.

Four Saint Realm experts had faced a First Stage Transcendent Realm youth and not only failed to subdue him, but two of them had been trapped by his scheme; the Ice Sect's foundations had been severely damaged and countless disciples were unaccounted for — a crushing humiliation.

Yang Kai's mocking words enraged them, yet none dared to lash out.

"What are these worms?" Qian Hao asked in a low voice. "Since you released them, you should know better than anyone."

Yang Kai nodded lightly and replied without concern, "Soul Devouring Worms. Have you not heard of them?"

At that, the four wore suddenly grave expressions.

They had indeed heard of the Soul Devouring Worms — these ancient alien worms, so tiny as to be nearly undetectable, specialized in devouring soul energy. Once infected they proliferate rapidly and are difficult to purge.

Yet such things had only been spoken of in legend; who would have thought they still existed?

"Kid." One of the afflicted Saint Realm experts snorted coldly. "Although Ice Sect has long been secluded, we are not ignorant. Soul Devouring Worms are formidable, but to swallow the soul of a Saint Realm cultivator is absurd — it's impossible that these are Soul Devouring Worms!"

Saint Realm practitioners can ward against Soul Devouring Worms; powerful soul energy can eradicate these ancient creatures in an instant.

Thus when Yang Kai named the worm they had been the first to assume he lied.

Yang Kai grinned crookedly. "Sorry, but my Soul Devouring Worms might not be exactly like the legends — they're a bit stronger than rumored."

Since the last time he and Cang Yan and Fei Yu entered that predecessor's manor and obtained those ancient worms, nearly two years had passed. In that time the Soul Devouring Worms had lived within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness on the Five-Colored Treasure Island, nourished richly; Yang Kai could feel they had become more powerful.

While grappling with Qian Yue and destroying those ice mountains, Yang Kai scattered countless Soul Devouring Worms along the way. All the Ice Sect disciples forced out were infected, without exception.

"You say they're Soul Devouring Worms — fine. But why are you unscathed? How did you release them?" the man demanded coldly.

"You ask too many questions; I have no obligation to answer them," Yang Kai said contemptuously. "All I can tell you is that your Ice Sect disciples won't face mortal danger within half an hour. Beyond that half hour I make no promises — these little worms don't obey me so neatly!"

"You… you will bring about your own destruction. If a single Ice Sect disciple perishes, you will pay with your life."

Yang Kai laughed out loud. "Let a few hundred go with me into the grave — if you're willing to sacrifice them, then so be it!"

The four were suddenly silent, struck with throbbing headaches.

The Ice Sect's disciples were never many — at most five hundred. If two or three hundred died at once, the loss would be catastrophic. This brat was a devil who would stoop to anything; despicable to the extreme.

The four now hated Yang Kai, but feared to act rashly; although they could confidently kill him with a single strike,

what would become of those Soul Devouring Worms afterwards?

Yet to bow to him now was a bitter pill none could swallow; as each seethed inwardly, a woman's voice suddenly floated over: "Little fellow, is your surname Yang?"

Yang Kai's expression changed; he had not detected anyone approaching, but following the voice saw, to his shock, a graceful figure standing not far beside him.

The woman looked exceedingly young, at most about Su Yan's age, yet her cultivation depth was unfathomable — her aura steady and placid like an ancient well. From her came a tremendous pressure.

This pressure was something he had not felt from the four Ice Sect elders.

She stood there as if fused to this frozen world, present everywhere at once.

Saint Realm Third Stage!

Yang Kai drew a deep breath and braced himself.

Though he recognized her as a formidable enemy, strangely, upon hearing her single question Yang Kai's violent anger and rage lessened noticeably.

Her voice carried a strange power that seemed to dispel grievances and injustice within his heart — soft and sweet, like heaven's music, utterly pleasing.

"Greetings, Sect Lord!" Qian Hao and the others straightened their faces and bowed.

The woman smiled faintly. "No need for such formality. Your disturbance here has been rather loud, hasn't it?"

Though her tone bore no reproach, Qian Hao and the others were thoroughly ashamed, wishing for a hole to hide in; their faces flushed red.

Yang Kai's eyes flickered. "Are you the Ice Sect's sect leader?"

"Yes, I am the Ice Sect's sect leader, Qing Ya." The woman tilted her head slightly, smiling; her aura was pure as ice, free of any impurity, refreshing to behold. Her voice, soft, asked again, "Is your surname Yang?"

The hostility on Yang Kai's face drained considerably; he relaxed and nodded slightly.

"Then it's you — the person Meng Wuya mentioned?"

"Yes."

"Even better than he said. I didn't expect you to find this place so quickly." Qing Ya pressed her lips in a smile.

"I didn't expect the Ice Sect's leader to be so young and lovely. I thought Shopkeeper Meng's friend would be a wizened old crone; meeting you today has been eye-opening." Yang Kai looked her over with genuine surprise in his clear gaze, no lasciviousness — only admiration.

"Is that what you think?" Qing Ya seemed pleased; her smile grew brighter.

"You smooth-talking brat!" Qian Yue snorted, turning her mouth in disgust. "Clearly no good!"

"For Shopkeeper Meng to know someone like you, I judged him too lowly," Yang Kai said, turning serious as he nodded.

Qing Ya chuckled softly; Yang Kai's flattery was so deft as to leave no trace, and her heart was pleased.

Qian Hao and the others watched in private, ill at ease. They had not seen their sect leader smile like this for a very long time — never had they expected a nobody to bring such mirth to her.

Inwardly they cursed the boy, concluding he must be a lecher who fancied many women to understand their hearts so well; their faces showed nothing but contempt.
