## Chapter 17 — Battle with the Demon Beast

In the afternoon, Yang Kai changed direction and headed toward the location of Lingxiao Pavilion.

He had only taken three days off, not counting the day he set out. He had to return before dawn tomorrow, or else he would face punishment.

There was plenty of time. Yang Kai estimated he was about a hundred li away from Lingxiao Pavilion, not too far, and he could arrive before nightfall.

His heart was filled with anticipation, wondering what kind of improvement the incense burner from the third page of the Wordless Black Book would bring him. His mood was light, and his steps quick.

But before he had traveled half the distance, Yang Kai suddenly heard a series of furious roars and heart-wrenching screams not far ahead, interspersed with the cries of a child.

Hearing the commotion, Yang Kai stopped in his tracks and listened carefully. Moments later, his expression changed, and he hurried toward the source of the sound.

He recognized the roars as those of the hunter he had met the night before, and the crying was that of the young boy.

The father and son must have encountered some trouble; otherwise, they would not sound so panicked. That night, Yang Kai had eaten their rations, and they had shown him kindness. How could he ignore them now?

As he ran, the hunter’s roars grew more desperate, while the boy’s cries gradually faded until barely audible.

Yang Kai’s face darkened, a bad premonition stirring in his heart.

When he arrived, even the hunter’s roars had ceased. Before him lay a dark cave entrance at the foot of a steep hill, surrounded by thick grass and covered in silver spider webs. On the ground lay a small bow—the very weapon the boy had held the night before.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai tossed his belongings aside, widened his eyes, and cautiously scanned the surroundings before plunging into the dark cave.

The interior was dim but not completely dark.

As his eyes adjusted, Yang Kai was shocked to see the cave filled with spider webs. Along the walls and floor, silver-white threads as thick as chopsticks crisscrossed and overlapped, blocking the path forward.

The cave was damp and shadowy, with water dripping steadily from the ceiling. The ground beneath his feet gave slightly with each step.

Holding his breath, Yang Kai moved deeper. After only a few paces, he spotted a figure almost entirely wrapped in spider silk, resembling a cocoon. Only the face was visible—it was the hunter he had met the night before.

Yang Kai hurried forward and tested the man’s condition. The hunter had merely fainted from shock and was otherwise unharmed. Yang Kai quickly pressed his fingers to the man’s philtrum.

The hunter slowly regained consciousness and, upon seeing Yang Kai, urgently said, “Save the child! He’s been dragged inside. Please, save him!”

“Dragged inside?” Yang Kai was alarmed. He fumbled to untangle the thick, resilient spider silk binding the hunter, but it was too tough to loosen quickly. Forced to give up for the moment, he plunged further into the cave.

From behind, the hunter warned, “Be careful. It’s a spider demon beast!”

The word “demon beast” made Yang Kai’s heart skip a beat. Demon beasts were no ordinary wild animals to be slaughtered at will; they were true monsters, each one a force beyond his current ability to provoke.

The reason the thirty-li perimeter outside Black Wind Mountain was considered a safe zone was precisely because no demon beasts roamed there. Yet now, one had appeared here, defying all expectations.

Knowing a demon beast lurked ahead, Yang Kai moved with even greater caution. After creeping forward about ten zhang, he finally saw the hunter’s son.

The boy was tightly bound in spider silk like his father, stuck to a massive spider web suspended in midair.

Beside him, a giant Flower-Backed Spider extended its proboscis, piercing the boy’s arm. Bright red blood flowed clearly from the boy’s body into the spider’s mouth.

On the cave floor lay piles of strange white bones, evidence that this spider demon beast had already claimed many victims.

Yang Kai had no time to consider whether he could defeat the spider. Any delay could cost the boy his life. Without a sound, he charged forward.

The giant Flower-Backed Spider was caught off guard, interrupted mid-feast. A powerful force struck from the side, tearing a large hole in the spider web. Both spider and Yang Kai were thrown backward, and the boy fell to the ground.

Enraged by the sudden attack, the spider’s eight hairy legs flailed on the ground as its multiple eyes fixed on Yang Kai.

Before he could rise, the spider lunged and pinned him down.

Yang Kai roared and struck out with an iron fist, landing just beneath the spider’s mouth. The blow staggered the beast, and seizing the moment, Yang Kai kicked it away.

Rolling to his feet, Yang Kai crouched low, eyes sharp, watching the spider’s movements.

The brief skirmish eased his mind somewhat. This demon beast was not high-level; otherwise, he would never have dared to fight it. It was likely only a first-level demon beast.

Even so, a first-level demon beast was no easy opponent for Yang Kai’s current strength.

Both sized each other up. The spider was calm and unhurried, but Yang Kai grew impatient. The boy appeared severely bloodied and showed signs of poisoning. If he did not end this quickly, there would be no hope of saving him.

Suddenly, the spider opened its mouth and expelled a gleaming silk thread, shooting directly at Yang Kai.

Having faced such spider silk before, Yang Kai knew better than to get caught. He rolled aside just in time to avoid it.

But the spider paid no mind to his evasion and continued to spit silk at one spot. Before Yang Kai could react, the cave was sealed off by a huge spider web, cutting off his retreat and trapping him inside.

“Is it forcing me to fight to the death?” Yang Kai smiled grimly. His last hesitation vanished, replaced by a surge of pride.

In this situation, killing the spider was the only way out. If so, then it would be a battle to the death.

Time was pressing. Yang Kai wasted no moment. Pushing off the ground, he swiftly closed the distance to the Flower-Backed Spider. Another silk thread shot toward him, but Yang Kai was ready and dodged it.

After avoiding three silk attacks, he finally closed in. Before he could throw a punch, the spider raised a front leg and struck fiercely.

Yang Kai raised his arm to block, but the spider’s sharp leg pierced through his arm.

Pain exploded through him, and he roared. Blood surged through his body, but instead of fear or panic, an inexplicable excitement and anticipation welled up in his chest. His bones seemed to resonate, warmth spreading throughout his body.
