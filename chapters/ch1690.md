## Chapter 1690 — Exasperated Beyond Words

“Correct. This place is my Sea of Consciousness,” a voice came from the side.

Yang Kai turned his head and saw, to his surprise, Yang Yan sitting cross-legged in the void, forming a strange hand seal, her bearing solemn; various halos continually shimmered and faded around her, the radiance holy to the extreme.

She smiled at him sweetly, exactly as he remembered Yang Yan.

"Is it you, or her?" Yang Kai frowned, unsure.

Yang Yan pursed her lips and said, "Is there a difference?"

Yang Kai shrugged. "Maybe to you there is none, but to me there is. I don't want her to cut me down in a fit of rage — she is the Starry Sky Emperor!"

"I am the Starry Sky Emperor!" Yang Yan snorted.

"Fine, it seems to be you then." Yang Kai breathed easier; as long as it wasn't the legendary Emperor actually speaking to him, there was no problem. He looked around and asked, "Did you need me for something?"

"Nothing much." Yang Yan slowly shook her head. "I just sensed your aura and pulled you in."

Yang Kai forced a bitter smile.

He told himself he was no longer the ignorant youth he once was. His strength had undergone an earth-shaking transformation — invincible beneath the Void King Realm, and even against ordinary Void Kings, he dared to fight head-on.

Yet beside Yang Yan, he became like a little fish or shrimp that could be pinched and tossed at will...

Yang Kai was greatly struck.

Perhaps sensing his thoughts, Yang Yan giggled, "You needn't belittle yourself. Frankly, I have never seen someone cultivate as rapidly as you; even in that place you would still count as a top-tier genius. What you lack is only the tempering of time. Give you enough time and one day you will be able to stand at my height."

"Are you comforting me?" Yang Kai glanced at her and frowned. "What is that place you mentioned?"

Yang Yan smiled without answering, taking on a mysterious air.

Seeing she did not intend to explain, Yang Kai waved his hand, "Forget it, let's not talk about it."

Yang Yan nodded lightly, but her expression suddenly turned solemn. “Though I’ve been in slumber, merging the divine souls of my incarnation and my main body, I’m not entirely ignorant of the outside world. I can sense that something has changed on Dark Star in recent years. Two months ago, Ye Xijun even brought people here. What exactly happened? Is Lingxiao Sect still safe?”

"Lingxiao Sect is fine, but Dark Star has a big problem." Yang Kai sighed, flew before Yang Yan and sat cross-legged, then recounted to her how the Corpse Spirit Sect's armies had ravaged the place.

Yang Yan listened intently, and only at the end did she nod. "So beneath Zangxiong Valley there was suppressed an Underworld Spring Source. That is our fault — if we had not taken the Sun's True Essence away, that Underworld Spring Source would never have reappeared in the mortal world."

"That's why I feel troubled. If it were something else, Lingxiao Sect could ignore it and stay in the headquarters while the outside world tore itself apart; it wouldn't concern me. But this matter ultimately has some of my responsibility, so I cannot simply stand aside." Yang Kai sighed.

Yang Yan obviously agreed with Yang Kai and, after some thought, said, "Can you go meet that mysterious leader of the Corpse Spirit Sect?"

"You are interested in him?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Not interested, per se. I only feel that his method of transforming corpse spirits and his means of controlling the Corpse Spirit Sect resemble someone I once knew."

"Who?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"That person called himself the Corpse Emperor. Back then he also controlled a race and called them the Corpse Spirit Race, so I paid attention."

"The Corpse Emperor..." Yang Kai sucked in a cold breath and his expression flickered. "Is he on the same level as you?"

Yang Yan is the Starry Sky Emperor, and anyone daring to call themselves 'Emperor' would clearly be an existence of the same caliber.

Yang Yan merely nodded.

Yang Kai's face instantly turned extremely ugly.

Yang Yan pursed her lips and smiled. "You needn't be so tense. The Corpse Emperor could not possibly come here, so that man cannot be the Corpse Emperor. I only suspect he has some connection with the Corpse Emperor — perhaps an old acquaintance of mine. My old acquaintance had a good relationship with the Corpse Emperor, so it is not surprising he knows how to transform Corpse Spirits."

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and looked at Yang Yan. "Even if that man is not the Corpse Emperor, if he is your old acquaintance then he certainly is not someone I can withstand. If I rashly go meet him, isn't that courting death?"

“Of course I wouldn’t send you to your death!” Yang Yan shot Yang Kai a reproachful glare. “If that person truly is who I suspect, his strength absolutely won’t exceed the Void King Realm — at most, he’s at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Dark Star’s own laws suppress cultivation; as long as he remains here, it’s impossible for him to break through!”

Yang Kai's expression cleared somewhat; if that mysterious leader were truly only a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, then there was little to fear.

Yet...

"What is this old acquaintance of yours? Why do you care so much?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Yang Yan was silent for a while before explaining, "You should know my main body fell into slumber because she was grievously wounded in a great battle and had no choice but to sleep in the Imperial Garden to recuperate. The old acquaintance I mentioned... was the one who wounded me."

Yang Kai struggled to keep his mind calm and his soul steady, and asked with a bitter tone, "Didn't you say that person was slain in that battle?"

Yang Kai had some understanding of the secrets of that battle: the Starry Sky Emperor fell into slumber because of severe injuries suffered in a great war, and her enemy was said to have been slain on the spot.

Yet now Yang Yan said that man might still be alive.

A chill ran down Yang Kai's spine.

Someone capable of wounding Yang Yan would, without doubt, be of the same class of existence as Yang Yan and the Corpse Emperor.

"I smashed him to pieces. But that fellow's means of escape were superb; perhaps his divine soul fled and survived without my notice. Rest assured, his situation is unlike mine: I was wounded and can recover given enough time, but his physical body was shattered, and resurrection will not be so simple, especially on Dark Star."

Yang Kai frowned and nodded. "If that's the case, I can go meet him. But even if, as you say, the Corpse Spirit Sect's leader is that man, what do you intend to do?"

Yang Yan shook her head. "It's not what I plan to do, it's what you must do. If the Corpse Spirit Sect's leader is truly him, you must kill him in the shortest time possible. Otherwise, when he recovers his Yuan Qi the entire Star Domain will suffer."

“You’re the Starry Sky Great Emperor! Can’t you just slap him to death?” Yang Kai looked at Yang Yan with exasperation.

Yang Yan shook her head. "I am temporarily unable to act."

Yang Kai was so furious he was nearly at the point of cursing; after a long silence he nodded firmly, "Very well. I'll go meet him now."

"Be careful. That man is always sly and malicious, skilled at controlling others to serve him, rarely appearing personally. If you find an opportunity, you must exterminate him completely!"

"I understand!" Yang Kai replied casually.

"Then go." Yang Yan waved, and in the next moment Yang Kai felt an invisible force in the Sea of Consciousness world pushing him out and expelling him.

When he came back to his senses, Yang Kai found himself standing beside the wooden bed; Yang Yan still slept there with her eyes shut.

Turning, Yang Kai strode out of the pavilion.

Although he had promised Yang Yan to meet that mysterious leader, the man's secrecy made finding him unquestionably difficult. Even the White-Clothed Corpse General he had slain did not know the leader's true cultivation or appearance.

Fortunately, Yang Kai did not intend to act alone.

Upon returning to Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai immediately sent word to Qian Tong.

On Dark Star, Qian Tong is the undisputed number one, his cultivation reaching the Void King Realm; he would surely be crucial in the forthcoming operation.

Yingyue Hall should already be secure; to solve the troubles on Dark Star they must eradicate the Corpse Spirit Sect, and Qian Tong should be willing to join forces with him against that mysterious leader.

Yingyue Hall is not close to Lingxiao Sect; even if Qian Tong wished to hurry over, it would take at least one month.

Yang Kai waited carefully while also improving his strength.

In Ice Heart Valley he used the Star Emperor Token to fight Luo Hai, broke through his own shackles, and advanced to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, standing but one step away from the Void King Realm.

On the way back his cultivation continued to increase bit by bit, approaching its limit, and his Shi had already been perfected.

With the might of the Domain Stone and the trials he had undergone in the Blood Prison, Yang Kai had also developed his own understanding of Domain.

In other words, if conditions permitted now, Yang Kai could already begin to break into the Void King Realm.

But he was not in a hurry; the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm was laying the foundation for the Void King Realm. The firmer he tempered his Shi now, the easier it would be to form a Domain upon ascending.

He planned to deal with the Corpse Spirit Sect's trouble first, then leave Dark Star for a while to handle several matters he had long been concerned with.

Those matters were crucial for raising his power and for uncovering the mysteries of the Star Domain.

Days passed and within Lingxiao Sect there were no waves; almost everyone immersed themselves in cultivation.

They all knew such days would not last. When the time came for Yang Kai to strike the Corpse Spirit Sect, they would have no time to cultivate even if they wished.

Because of that, Lingxiao Sect's experts cherished the hours they had even more; every increase in strength was another piece of living capital to buy more time and to kill more enemies in the coming war with the Corpse Spirit Sect.

Exactly one month later Qian Tong arrived at Lingxiao Sect and was immediately led into the main headquarters by the disciples assigned to receive outsiders.

Ever since Yang Kai slew the White-Clothed Corpse General Kang Feirao, the Corpse Spirit Sect's besieging army had dispersed, and Lingxiao Sect finally restored contact with the outside world and learned something of the situation; Qian Tong traveled here without obstruction.
