## Chapter 2188 — Azure-Blood Ganoderma

"Mm, that is indeed a possible situation. I overlooked it." Lan Xun was momentarily stunned; after a moment she smiled and said, "That’s easy to handle. If that really happens, then we’ll compare the age of the herbs. Whoever brings out the older one, Brother Yang will use theirs!"

“Great idea!” Zhuang Bufan nodded solemnly. “The older the herb, the stronger its medicinal power, and the higher the chances of success in alchemy.”

“If everyone agrees, then…” Lan Xun looked around at the crowd with a smile, waiting for their response.

“I have no objections. It’s all about luck, after all. We’re all the same!” Finally, someone was the first to speak up. To everyone’s surprise, it was actually Wuchang, who seemed quite interested in this proposal.

“Alright, I like this suggestion. I have no objections either!” Xia Sheng shrugged.

“Let’s do as Her Highness the Princess says.” Zhuang Bufan also spoke up.

With these three voicing no objections in turn, even if others had complaints, they dared not voice them. What’s more, this proposal was put forth by Lan Xun herself. To refute it now would be to embarrass her… Her Highness the Princess was gentle by nature, but Xiao Chen was not so easy to deal with.

Instantly, everyone’s stance became unified, and they all expressed their agreement with Lan Xun’s proposal.

“Many thanks for your cooperation!” Seeing everyone agree, Lan Xun finally smiled and turned to Yang Kai. “Brother Yang, now you can tell us what the last medicinal ingredient you need is.”

As soon as she spoke, the crowd fell silent, all eyes turning to Yang Kai. Many faces showed anticipation and nervousness—after all, this was a chance based entirely on luck. If the ingredient Yang Kai named happened to be in their possession, they’d have a great chance at obtaining a Supreme Mystic Pill.

That was a Spiritual Pill that could practically lead straight to the Emperor Realm—who wouldn’t be tempted?

Thump, thump. Some people’s hearts pounded violently in their chests.

Under everyone’s gaze, Yang Kai slowly raised his palm and declared in a loud voice, “I need an Azure-Blood Ganoderma at least five thousand years old!”

“Azure-Blood Ganoderma… That is indeed a rare medicinal herb.” Lan Xun arched her brows, smiled, and looked around. “I wonder if anyone here has what Brother Yang needs? If you can provide it, you’ll get a Supreme Mystic Pill. This is a rare opportunity—one that can’t be forced.”

From her tone, it seemed she had great confidence in Yang Kai, as if she believed that as long as the ingredients were gathered, he would surely succeed in refining the pill.

No one knew where her confidence came from.

As soon as she finished speaking, many people immediately looked disappointed. Clearly, they didn’t have such a Spiritual Medicine as Azure-Blood Ganoderma. A few martial artists, however, immersed their minds and began searching through their Spatial Rings…

“Hahahaha…” Suddenly, a burst of loud laughter rang out.

Everyone looked toward the sound and saw a man with Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, his face full of excitement as he laughed and gesticulated. When he noticed everyone looking at him, he was startled, quickly restrained his laughter, and his expression became quite complicated.

“Did this friend perhaps find something?” Lan Xun looked at him with a smile.

The man immediately leapt from where he stood, suppressing his excitement and elation, and replied solemnly, “Thanks to Her Highness the Princess, I do indeed have an Azure-Blood Ganoderma!”

“Oh?” Lan Xun arched her brows, looking pleased. “Please, take it out and let us see.”

The man hesitated slightly, but Lan Xun understood and immediately said, “Rest assured. I always keep my word. If you truly have the ingredient Brother Yang needs, you will definitely get a Supreme Mystic Pill!”

“Many thanks, Your Highness!” The man had been waiting for these words. After hearing them, he no longer hesitated and immediately took out an Azure-Blood Ganoderma about half a foot long, its entire body a vivid crimson-green, as if forged from fresh blood, from his Spatial Ring.

“It really is an Azure-Blood Ganoderma!” Yang Kai glanced at it and immediately knew the man wasn’t faking. “Let me take a look.”

The man held the Azure-Blood Ganoderma in both hands, his body trembling slightly. It was as if he were holding not a Spiritual Medicine but his own bright future, terrified he might drop and shatter it.

When he reached Yang Kai, he carefully handed the Azure-Blood Ganoderma over, then stood there nervously, full of anticipation.

“What dumb luck!”

“Why didn’t such a chance fall to me?”

“Heaven is jealous of talent! Damn it, I refuse to accept this!”

…

All around, voices rose in a clamor—some jealous, some resentful, some envious, all sorts of emotions.

Hearing these comments, the man couldn’t help but feel a bit lightheaded, his face full of pride.

“This is indeed Azure-Blood Ganoderma…” Suddenly, Yang Kai frowned. “But its age is insufficient—only about three thousand years, quite a bit short.”

“What?” The man’s face changed dramatically. He stared wide-eyed at Yang Kai and stammered, “You… you… what did you say? Look again…”

"No need." As Yang Kai spoke, he had already returned the Azure-Blood Ganoderma. "With each additional thousand years, the color of the Azure-Blood Ganoderma shifts slightly. The one you brought is mature enough for most Spiritual Medicines, but it can’t be used for the Supreme Mystic Pill. Sorry to disappoint you."

“Impossible!” the man cried out.

The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. He’d thought a Supreme Mystic Pill was within reach, but fate had played a trick on him at the last moment. How could he accept it?

“Look again!” He glared at Yang Kai, refusing to give up.

Yang Kai said, “If you don’t trust me, you can ask someone else to check. I’m sure there are others here who can judge the age of herbs.”

As soon as he finished, Zhuang Bufan called out, “Friend, I am Zhuang Bufan of Wuhua Hall. My knowledge of herbs isn’t as deep as Brother Yang’s, but I know a thing or two. If you trust me, let me take a look, how about it?”

“I trust you!” The man immediately rushed over to Zhuang Bufan and handed him the Azure-Blood Ganoderma.

Compared to the unknown Yang Kai, Zhuang Bufan’s name was like thunder to his ears—renowned and respected. The words spoken by such a figure naturally carried great weight, so without hesitation, the man pinned all his hopes on Zhuang Bufan, eagerly wishing he would overturn Yang Kai’s earlier judgment.

While the man waited, Zhuang Bufan carefully examined the Azure-Blood Ganoderma, even sniffed its medicinal aroma, and scraped off a bit of powder to taste.

His movements were methodical and practiced—it was clear this wasn’t his first time doing such a thing.

After a while, Zhuang Bufan slowly shook his head, handed the Azure-Blood Ganoderma back, and said, “Brother Yang’s research into herbs is far deeper than mine. He could tell the age at a glance. I am deeply impressed… Friend, your Azure-Blood Ganoderma is indeed only three thousand years old.”

“How… how could this be?” the man muttered, utterly dejected.

When Yang Kai said the Azure-Blood Ganoderma was only three thousand years old, the man hadn’t quite believed it. But with Zhuang Bufan confirming it, he had no choice but to accept it.

The martial artists who had previously been jealous of the man now couldn’t help but feel a bit of schadenfreude…

“With so many people here, is there really no one else with Azure-Blood Ganoderma?” Yang Kai looked around and called out.

No one responded!

Yang Kai let out a sigh.

“Brother Yang, if you used that three-thousand-year-old Azure-Blood Ganoderma to refine the pill…” Lan Xun frowned at him.

“It would be a complete waste!” Yang Kai replied. “Your Highness should know, the more precious the Spiritual Pill, the stricter the requirements for ingredients. Not to mention a two-thousand-year gap—even a few hundred years would make it unusable.”

“Sigh…” Lan Xun let out a soft sigh. She knew Yang Kai was right, but she’d asked out of a sliver of hope.

“Such is fate!” Xia Sheng suddenly shook his head and said, “Azure-Blood Ganoderma isn’t a common Spiritual Medicine. Having even one here is already lucky—how could there be a second? Looks like we’ll have to compete by our own means after all!”

“Actually…” Lan Xun looked a bit embarrassed and said helplessly, “I do have an Azure-Blood Ganoderma, and it should meet Brother Yang’s requirements.”

“Ah?” Xiao Chen was startled. “Then why didn’t you take it out, Your Highness?”

Yang Kai also looked at Lan Xun in surprise, a thoughtful expression flashing across his face. Soon, he smiled, cupped his fists, and said, “Your Highness is truly magnanimous. I am in awe!”

In that instant, he understood why Lan Xun had delayed in producing her Azure-Blood Ganoderma.

It wasn’t that Lan Xun was reluctant…

She was the daughter of the Radiant Moon Great Emperor. No matter how precious a Spiritual Medicine was, she wouldn’t be stingy. She hadn’t taken it out because she wanted to give others a chance, which was why she kept confirming with everyone else.

But in the end, there was no other way, so she had to step forward herself.

She probably hadn’t expected that the ingredient Yang Kai needed would be the very one she possessed when she made her proposal earlier.

No one present was a fool. After hearing Yang Kai’s words, a little thought made the situation clear, and for a moment, everyone couldn’t help but feel respect and admiration for Lan Xun.

Lan Xun’s cheeks flushed slightly, making her look even more stunning.

“How about this? I can take out the Azure-Blood Ganoderma, but as for the Supreme Mystic Pill we agreed on earlier… I don’t want it.” Lan Xun pursed her red lips as she spoke.

“How can that be?” Xiao Chen was the first to object.

“Shut up!” Lan Xun frowned and scolded him. “It’s my own item—I have the right to decide what to do with it!”

Xiao Chen opened his mouth, but really didn’t dare say anything more. His face turned livid with frustration.

“Your Highness, that’s not right.” Xia Sheng smiled. “Since it was agreed beforehand, what you deserve should be given to you. If you forcefully refuse, then everyone else who gets a Spiritual Medicine will owe you a favor—after all, no one knows if the pill they get originally belonged to you. That’s a losing deal, and I won’t do it!”
