## Chapter 136 — Ominous Atmosphere

After sitting in meditation for half a day, Yang Kai finally rose to investigate the situation within the cave.

Earlier, time had been pressing, and he had only taken a cursory glance. Now, he intended to search thoroughly.

He believed he was currently situated in the middle section of the cave, as both sides were accessible. Listening to the sound of the wind, Yang Kai deduced that the left side likely led to the exit, since the wind was blowing in from that direction, while the right side led deeper into the cave.

After some thought, Yang Kai chose to walk toward the right side. Given his current perilous situation, it was wiser not to rush out of the cave.

Not long after, he suddenly caught a whiff of a medicinal fragrance. In the dim light, he discovered that there were many peculiar herbs growing on both sides of the cave.

At a glance, these plants were clearly of extraordinary quality, but he was unsure if they were poisonous.

Indeed, this was the Inheritance Celestial Cave! Although Yang Kai could not identify what these herbs were or their value, he believed that any single one of them would likely be worth a fortune if taken outside.

For the moment, he refrained from touching them. Firstly, he did not know how to harvest them, and secondly, even if he did, he had no place to store them. After all, he was alone here, so it wouldn’t hurt to leave them be for now.

As he continued to explore, Yang Kai found that there were indeed many treasures in this place, all kinds of colorful and exotic plants he had never seen before, not knowing how many years they had been growing.

After walking for a full hour, Yang Kai suddenly noticed a flickering light ahead, accompanied by a dreamy, ethereal calling in his ears.

Feeling a sense of caution, he moved toward the source of the light.

Before long, he arrived in front of the glowing object.

It was a round orb about the size of a fist, radiating a gentle light that illuminated the surrounding area for several zhang.

Looking around, Yang Kai's pupils involuntarily contracted.

He realized that he had reached the very bottom of the cave, and not far from him sat a skeleton, cross-legged. The skeleton was adorned in an exquisitely luxurious purple robe, and its hollow eyes were fixed on Yang Kai, giving off an indescribably eerie and sinister air.

This person had likely been dead for many years, but for some reason, Yang Kai felt that he had not been a good person in life, as the skeleton exuded a sense of evil and malice that made Yang Kai's heart race with unease.

Was this the one who had condensed the Inheritance Celestial Cave? Yang Kai couldn't help but recall the origins of the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

If that were the case, then this place must hold his legacy?

Just as Yang Kai was frowning in deep thought, a sudden loud noise erupted from behind him.

His expression changed, and he turned to look, only to find that his path back had been cut off. A massive stone had descended from the cave ceiling, blocking the way to the outside.

Turning back, he noticed that the glowing orb had suddenly begun to flicker erratically, and within this confined space of less than a few dozen zhang, a cacophony of ghostly wails and howls erupted.

A chilling wind swept through, as if he had fallen into a hellish realm, sending shivers down his spine. Within him, the True Yang Primordial Qi surged wildly.

Yang Kai's expression grew serious, and he said nothing, merely narrowing his eyes to remain vigilant of his surroundings.

The ghostly wails persisted for an unknown duration, constantly disturbing Yang Kai's mind. If it had been someone with a weaker will, they would surely have lost their composure. But perseverance and resilience were Yang Kai's greatest strengths; how could mere sounds shake him?

As time passed, Yang Kai distinctly sensed that the ghostly wails had become somewhat agitated, though it was subtle, it was clearly different from before.

Yang Kai's calm demeanor seemed to infuriate the sounds, yet they were helpless against him.

Noticing this, Yang Kai grew even calmer. Although he did not know what was happening, he simply sat cross-legged and assumed a meditative posture.

The sounds indeed became more frantic, and the chilling wind howled back and forth within the small space, while the light from the orb flickered more rapidly, making the atmosphere increasingly sinister.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, his breathing steady, his expression unchanged.

After several hours, the sounds abruptly ceased, and the erratically flickering orb finally stabilized. Aside from the stone door blocking his way back, the place was now just as it had been when Yang Kai arrived.

"Is it over?" Yang Kai's lips curled into a disdainful smile, and he suddenly shouted, "Who is playing tricks? Show yourself!"

His voice echoed in the confined space, reverberating endlessly.

Suddenly, a series of eerie, cackling laughs echoed back. Upon hearing this laugh, Yang Kai's hair stood on end, not out of fear, but because the sound was truly unbearable, churning his insides.

Not only did his body react uncomfortably, but even in his mind, it felt as if a buzzing had begun.

A soul attack? Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly. He had initially thought someone had come here before him, deliberately trying to scare him away to monopolize the treasures. But now, he dared not think so.

One laugh, and the soul moves! This was clearly not something that disciples from the three sects could accomplish. Only a master above the Divine Roaming Realm could employ such a technique.

This place was indeed strange!

"Young man, your willpower is commendable, and your courage is not small, to dare speak to me in such a manner!" The unpleasant voice suddenly spoke, drifting about, making it impossible for Yang Kai to locate its source.

"Who are you?" Yang Kai's expression turned cold as he carefully searched while asking.

Another round of unpleasant cackling followed. After laughing, the voice said, "Who am I? I don't remember. Who am I? Perhaps I am the master of this place."

"You are the master of this Inheritance Celestial Cave?" Yang Kai's voice involuntarily rose.

With over a thousand disciples from the three sects gathered here, they had entered the Inheritance Celestial Cave to obtain the mysterious legacy. It could be said that whoever could reach the inheritance here would surely attain a revered status in the future, provided they did not meet an untimely death.

Yang Kai had not expected to gain any inheritance himself; he had merely entered like most others, hoping to reap some benefits. But regardless, once he was here, he would naturally be interested in the inheritance.

Now this voice claimed to be the master of this place, even someone as composed as Yang Kai couldn't help but feel a stir in his heart.

The voice did not respond immediately, waiting for a moment before saying, "Yes, I am the master of this place! Young man, do you wish to obtain my legacy?"

Yang Kai did not reply, his brows furrowing as he contemplated the truth of the voice's words.

"I see you seem to have just been injured, likely by someone else?" the voice continued leisurely. "Do you wish to take revenge? Do you want to hunt down those who harmed you and make them understand that you are not to be trifled with?"

A few strands of cold wind swirled around Yang Kai's ears, moving so slowly that he could hardly perceive them. Yet, upon hearing the voice's words, he found himself nodding involuntarily, "Yes!"

"You harbor hatred deep within your heart, a hatred that others cannot see! You wish to grow stronger, to slaughter those who look down on you, do you not?"

Yang Kai's expression showed slight struggle, his brows furrowed, and veins bulged on his forehead. Although he felt that the words were somewhat off, the voice instilled a sense of resonance within him.

"Yes..." Yang Kai's voice trembled slightly.

"I can help you fulfill your wish! Make your dreams come true. Do you wish to inherit my legacy?" the voice continued to coax.

"If you are willing, just nod your head, and I will grant you my inheritance! This is a great fortune."

"Will you or will you not?"

"Just a gentle nod is all it takes; it is easy for you..."

"Miss this opportunity, and you will surely regret it..."

The voice continued to echo, like a gentle rain or a spring breeze brushing by, filling Yang Kai's mind with unparalleled temptation.

A hint of confusion flickered in Yang Kai's eyes, his head moving slightly, his lips parting and closing repeatedly, seemingly on the verge of agreeing to the voice's request. But suddenly, with a muffled grunt, his eyes abruptly regained clarity, and a look of lingering fear crossed his face, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.

The other party had evidently employed some method to nearly ensnare him.

"Eh?" The voice sounded exceedingly surprised. "You actually bit your tongue to stimulate your senses; your willpower is indeed formidable!"

"Hmph! Who exactly are you, and what method did you use to manipulate my mind?" Yang Kai asked coldly.

"To be able to perceive this, young man, you are remarkable! As for who I am... who am I?" 

"You need not say; I already know. You are it!" Yang Kai's gaze suddenly fell upon the skeleton before him, filled with wariness as he slowly said, "I have heard that a master above the Divine Roaming Realm, as long as they condense their divine sense, even if their physical body is destroyed, as long as their divine sense remains, they can seek out a new body to possess! You must be a master who fell here many years ago, now seeking to occupy my body, right? You manipulated my mind precisely for this purpose!"

As soon as Yang Kai finished speaking, the voice fell silent. After a long while, it erupted into wild laughter: "Impressive, impressive! A mere young lad, with strength only at the Open Origin Seventh Layer, can see through this. Truly, talents emerge from the generations; I admire you."

As it spoke, the voice suddenly turned cold: "Since you have realized this, do you not fear?"

Yang Kai sneered: "Why should I fear? If you truly had the ability to forcibly erase my mind and occupy my body, why waste so many words with me? Why need to manipulate me into falling into your verbal trap? You may be a master, but that was before your death! Now, you can only resort to these tricks!"

"You ask... why should I fear you?" Yang Kai laughed coldly. "On the contrary, if I find your soul's hiding place, do you think you can still survive?"

"Youth, you are too arrogant," the voice said coldly. "Do you think I spoke so much to merely tempt you? Haha, I have already sent three strands of my divine sense into your mind; even if you resist now, you can no longer do so. Your body, I shall accept it with a smile!"
