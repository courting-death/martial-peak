## Chapter 2245 — Payment in Flesh Is Acceptable

"Elder Gao!" Yang Kai cupped his fists in greeting.

Gao Xueting nodded gently, her tone full of concern. "Was your recent seclusion a smooth one?"

Yang Kai replied, "Thanks to Elder Gao, there were no unexpected incidents."

"Cut the flattery!" Gao Xueting glared at him. "Your seclusion has nothing to do with me."

"Uh..." Yang Kai slapped his own thigh, not expecting Gao Xueting to be so blunt, leaving him a bit embarrassed.

"So, what brings you to me?" Gao Xueting resumed her earlier calm demeanor.

"Oh, it’s like this." Bringing up his business, Yang Kai quickly straightened up and said, "I wanted to ask Elder Gao, does Qingyang Shrine have any Formless Profound Grass?"

"Formless Profound Grass?" Gao Xueting frowned slightly at his words.

"It’s a Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Herb, not particularly rare." As an alchemist, Yang Kai was naturally well-versed in all kinds of spiritual flowers and exotic herbs.

"What do you need it for?" Gao Xueting asked curiously.

"Alchemy." Yang Kai replied evasively, his gaze shifting away. "Elder Gao, you know I’m an alchemist. Of course I need spiritual herbs for alchemy..."

The corners of Gao Xueting’s mouth lifted ever so slightly, as if a faint smile appeared. But she didn’t press Yang Kai’s obvious cover-up. Instead, she took out her Transmission Compass, infused it with Divine Sense, and said indifferently, "I’ll ask for you. Since this herb isn’t rare, the storehouse should have some in stock."

"Many thanks, Elder Gao." Yang Kai hurriedly expressed his gratitude.

After that, a long silence followed.

Staying in this cave mansion, Yang Kai felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles, completely ill at ease. He wanted to find something to chat about with Gao Xueting, but feared she’d find him annoying, so he could only remain silent.

Gao Xueting had no intention of speaking further either. She simply closed her eyes and meditated, treating him as if he didn’t exist, completely undisturbed.

After a while, the Transmission Compass in Gao Xueting’s hand suddenly buzzed.

She opened her beautiful eyes, checked the message, and looked at Yang Kai. "There is Formless Profound Grass, and quite a lot. How much do you need?"

"The more the better!" Yang Kai replied earnestly.

"Looks like... you’re planning to refine a lot of pills." Gao Xueting snorted lightly.

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh.

"What will you use to exchange for it?"

"Ah?" Yang Kai was stunned by her question.

Gao Xueting said, "Formless Profound Grass can’t be given to you for free. It belongs to the Shrine. What will you use to trade for it?"

"Elder Gao, are you doing business with me?" Yang Kai was shocked, never expecting this side of Gao Xueting.

"Let’s call it that." Gao Xueting nodded. "Judging by your look, you wanted it for free?"

Yang Kai quickly said, "How could I! I intended to buy it." He paused, then asked timidly, "Would Source Crystals do?"

"The Shrine isn’t lacking in Source Crystals." Gao Xueting replied expressionlessly.

Yang Kai was speechless. "If it’s business, what else can I use besides Source Crystals?"

"Hmph!" Gao Xueting snorted coldly, giving him a meaningful look. "Forget it, I’ll ask Junior Sister what the price should be."

"Much appreciated..." Yang Kai quickly wiped the sweat from his forehead.

For some reason, whenever he was with Gao Xueting, Yang Kai felt an immense pressure. He’d never felt this way even when dealing with Wen Zishan, and he couldn’t figure out why.

After a moment, Gao Xueting looked up again and said to Yang Kai, "Junior Sister said, Formless Profound Grass, one thousand Source Crystals per stalk."

"That’s a fair price." Yang Kai’s face lit up with joy.

"Upper-Level!" Gao Xueting added.

Yang Kai froze for a moment, then jumped up in shock. "Are you robbing me?"

Gao Xueting replied indifferently, "Junior Sister manages the Shrine’s storehouse. Everything there is under her control. If she says it’s one thousand Upper-Level Source Crystals, then it’s one thousand Upper-Level Source Crystals."

After speaking, she added, "What? Are you poor?"

"Not exactly," Yang Kai said, cold sweat forming on his brow. "It’s just... this price doesn’t make sense. Elder Gao, did you explain to Elder Chen that Formless Profound Grass is a Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Herb, and it’s not rare? Big Sects can cultivate it themselves, so why does it cost so many Source Crystals?"

"What do you take me for? Your messenger? If you want to ask, go ask yourself." Gao Xueting’s already cold face grew even colder.

Yang Kai had no idea why she was suddenly angry, and was left awkward, not knowing how to respond.

"However..." Gao Xueting suddenly changed the subject, her beautiful eyes roaming over Yang Kai, making him shiver. He wondered if Elder Gao, who appeared cold as ice, was actually passionate inside.

The thought startled him, making him even more uncomfortable.

"Junior Sister said, if you can’t afford to buy it, you can... mm, pay with your body. That’s her original words." Gao Xueting’s words were shocking.

"Gulp..."

Yang Kai couldn’t help but swallow, cold sweat streaming down his cheeks.

"Don’t misunderstand." Gao Xueting explained, "Junior Sister means, if you join the Shrine and become a disciple, you’ll get a huge discount. All the Formless Profound Grass you want will be given to you, and you can refine as many pills as you like."

"Become a Shrine disciple?" Yang Kai stared at her in astonishment.

"Unwilling?" Gao Xueting’s gaze turned icy. "Do you look down on the Shrine?"

"No, no, absolutely not." Yang Kai waved his hands repeatedly. "It’s just... Qingyang Shrine is such a large Sect. Is it really okay to recruit people so casually?"

Gao Xueting snorted, "Normally, joining the Shrine requires all kinds of checks and tests. To be blunt, the Shrine only recruits disciples once every ten years. Each time, at least several hundred thousand come to the Qingyang Mountain Range for the trial, but only about three hundred can actually become disciples. Even among those, only half become true disciples; the rest remain as outer mountain disciples, never able to enter the inner sect. But for you..." Here, Gao Xueting glanced sideways at Yang Kai, "We might make an exception and open a convenient door for you."

She acted as if she was giving Yang Kai a huge favor, as though he’d lose out if he refused.

"Heh heh..." Yang Kai could only laugh dryly. "Then I must thank Elder Gao and Elder Chen for your kindness."

"What’s your decision?" Gao Xueting pressed, not giving Yang Kai any time to think.

Yang Kai coughed a few times, realizing the seriousness of the question. Outwardly he remained calm, but his mind was racing.

Soon, he spoke up, "To let Elder Gao know, this Junior has always been used to wandering alone and has never joined any Sect..."

"Then what about Biyu Sect?" Gao Xueting interrupted him directly.

Yang Kai stared wide-eyed at her. "Elder Gao, have you been investigating me?"

Gao Xueting replied blandly, "Just a casual check. Your information isn’t hard to find. Our Shrine is vast and powerful; investigating someone is easy."

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. "Then how much does Elder Gao know about me?"

Gao Xueting said, "Other than the color of your underwear, I know everything. Including... that you’re not a native of the Star Realm."

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat, wiping his forehead. "Elder Gao, you really are well-informed."

In his heart, he cursed Bian Yuqing viciously. No doubt, Gao Xueting’s information came from her.

Bian Yuqing was only a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artist. If Gao Xueting really wanted to get information from her, Bian Yuqing absolutely couldn’t lie or hide anything.

Yang Kai just didn’t know when Gao Xueting had done this.

"Since Elder Gao knows about Biyu Sect, you must also understand why I joined, and what happened afterward." Seeing he couldn’t hide it, Yang Kai could only tell the truth.

"Mm." Gao Xueting nodded.

"During those months at Biyu Sect, I wasn’t happy at all!" Yang Kai said earnestly.

"Oh, don’t worry about that. The Shrine is nothing like small sects such as Biyu Sect. You’ll feel at home here. If you wish, I can even take you as my personal disciple and teach you cultivation myself."

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s expression brightened as he looked at Gao Xueting in surprise.

For her to say this, it meant Gao Xueting was truly sincere about recruiting him into Qingyang Shrine.

From another perspective, he did have the qualifications.

Young, with impressive cultivation, he was a target for all the great Sects. Moreover, he was a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist, a martial artist from a lower Star Domain, full of drive and solid foundation, and had even taken a Supreme Mystic Pill. With all these factors, as long as nothing major happened, it was only a matter of time before he advanced to the Emperor Realm and became a top expert.

Qingyang Shrine didn’t want to miss out on a future Emperor Realm expert, so his conditions were enough for Gao Xueting to try so hard.

Of course, given Gao Xueting’s cold personality, she wouldn’t say such things unless someone else was behind it. Who else but Wen Zishan?

Soon, Yang Kai figured everything out, and his heart stirred slightly.

To be honest, although Gao Xueting’s attempt to recruit him wasn’t particularly clever, it was sincere. During this time, Yang Kai had also felt the care and concern of the Qingyang Shrine seniors, and got along well with people like Xia Sheng.

If he really joined Qingyang Shrine and became one of them, it didn’t seem like a bad thing.

Joining a Sect had its own benefits, especially a powerful force like Qingyang Shrine. In the future, going out as a Shrine disciple, few would dare provoke him.

However, Yang Kai still had concerns.

His greatest concern was the demonic intent sealed within his body.

When he was corrupted by demonic intent and became a demon, he had fought Gao Xueting. If he really joined the Shrine and accidentally revealed something, who knew how Gao Xueting would deal with him.

The demonic intent of an Ancient Great Demon was not something that could be ignored.
