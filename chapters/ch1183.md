## Chapter 1183 — Breaking the Array

The moment Yang Kai activated his World-Ending Demon Eye, he immediately understood what had happened: he had unwittingly stepped into a formation, and it was very likely a natural maze-formation.

Yang Yan was a master of formations; having spent so long with her, Yang Kai had picked up some knowledge.

Only a maze-formation could make someone circle the same spot without realizing it. And formations that appear like this are naturally formed, not man-made.

The layout of this maze-formation was enormous; Saint King Realm warriors who entered here couldn't have set up such a formation, so only a naturally generated origin could explain it.

Understanding that, Yang Kai's heart went sour.

Yang Yan had said that man-made formations and naturally formed ones differ greatly: man-made formations always leave traces to follow, while natural formations are seamless and effortless, seldom showing flaws — they don't have array eyes or array gates, so using them to break the array is impossible.

Besides, Yang Kai was not proficient in formation techniques.

The World-Ending Demon Eye could pierce falsehoods and helped him see the nature of this place, but it couldn't provide a method for dismantling the formation.

If he wanted to break the formation, he had to rely on himself!

This was why Yang Kai despaired: if Yang Yan were here, her understanding of formations would make cracking this array easy, but for Yang Kai to do it would be unbearably hard.

After a moment he calmed; since he'd already accidentally stumbled in, he had to find an exit.

The most effective and fitting method, of course, was to tear open space!

Yang Kai excelled in spatial power; tearing open space was his best means of escape.

With that in mind, Yang Kai ripped a rift in the void and dove in. After his figure vanished, the rift quickly sealed.

A moment later, another rift opened in the same spot and Yang Kai shot back out.

He focused and looked around; his face darkened.

Having torn space and entered the spatial turbulence, he realized something was wrong: the normally active turbulence here was deathly still. Sure enough, when he tore space again he unsurprisingly returned to the original spot.

This maze not only deceived the senses but actually sealed this region of space, rendering his space-rifts useless — this was troublesome.

After thinking it over, Yang Kai had to accept that he could only rely on brute force to break the array; since no suitable method presented itself, he would have to smash it. He only hoped it wasn't too solid, or he might truly be trapped.

Resolving to act, Yang Kai widened his gaze and scrutinized the surroundings. Half an hour later he finally identified a point to attack — the scenery there appeared far more illusory than elsewhere, a weak link; if he could break that link, perhaps the maze would collapse on its own.

Producing the Hundred Mountains Painting, Yang Kai summoned ten mountain phantoms at once and hurled them viciously toward that spot.

Boom boom boom……

The violent crashing never ceased; the whole heaven and earth began to tremble.

Yang Kai watched intently where the Hundred Mountains Painting struck; after a while his expression brightened — under its attack the scenery grew even more illusory and twisted violently, seeming on the verge of collapse.

There's hope! Yang Kai further increased his Saint Yuan output.

But soon his face hardened and disappointment flooded him.

The spot that had become illusory, after a bout of distortion, restored itself to its original state, wasting all his previous attacks.

This maze could repair its damaged parts on its own! It was practically a sign that one would be trapped to death inside.

Yang Kai ground his teeth and drove the Hundred Mountains Painting to its limit; twenty mountain phantoms swirled about him, raining down to smash that place.

…...

Half a day later, Yang Kai glared ahead with eyes nearly tearing, his face full of fury.

The formation's solidity far exceeded his expectations. No matter how much force he used or how ferocious the assault, it could self-repair. The Hundred Mountains Painting had already been stored away — twenty mountain phantoms was the most he could summon; there was no point in persisting further, any more attacks would be only wasteful exertion.

Without a decisive, finishing blow there was no way to split that weak link; in other words, there had to be an attack like the overwhelming strike produced by Xie Jun's Secret Treasure — only absolute power could rip that weak spot and possibly shatter this maze.

He had neither the time nor the desire to temper that Secret Treasure, and besides, Yang Kai felt that even the earth-shattering blow from that treasure might not be enough to break the present illusion.

He could only resort to Golden Blood.

Yang Kai sighed softly — one drop of Golden Blood represented three months of his painstaking cultivation, so unless it was absolutely necessary he hated to use it.

Previously, wrapped by a blood-red crystal and slumbering in the Starry Sky for years, nearly a hundred drops of Golden Blood had condensed within him; he'd used a few intermittently and hadn't rushed to replenish them, so he still had over ninety drops now.

But now was no time to fuss over such things.

Yang Kai's expression grew grave as he extended a finger and slowly forced a drop of that supremely pure Golden Blood from his body.

In an instant, a surging tide of Qi and blood burst forth — the vitality and Qi held within the Golden Blood were terrifyingly potent.

This Golden Blood was purer than the golden blood that normally flowed in his veins. It sat quietly on his fingertip, trembling slightly like a tiny golden bead.

With a thought, that drop of Golden Blood transformed into a small, sharp arrow and, without hesitation, pierced the bounds of space to strike the formation's weak link.

Gold light flared so brilliantly Yang Kai could hardly keep his eyes open.

He had to close his right eye, squint with the left, and tensely watch the movements beyond.

A sound like silk tearing rang out. Yang Kai clearly saw the weakened section of the illusion array pierced through by the tiny arrow formed from his Golden Blood. Its power erupted in full, and the tear it opened spread outward with ferocious force.

Simultaneously, the surrounding illusory scenery twisted violently; many of the hills and mounds he'd seen moments before vanished.

The entire maze suffered a tremendous shock.

Yang Kai's face lit with joy and he prepared to dash forward when a sheet of crimson light suddenly surged from all directions, swallowing the golden radiance. Worse, as the red light arrived the torn rift began to rapidly close — it seemed the red light was repairing the damage.

Yang Kai panicked; he had already used a drop of Golden Blood — he could not allow the maze to mend itself again.

In grim resolve he forced out a second drop of Golden Blood.

With the second drop's joining and detonating, the red light was finally overwhelmed; in the resplendent gold, all the illusory mists turned like snow beneath a blazing sun and quickly melted away.

At the maze's weak link a golden entrance leisurely took shape.

Yang Kai wasted no time and plunged in.

Only after he passed did the golden light gradually fade, and the maze once again began to repair itself.

Leaving his original spot, Yang Kai suddenly found himself stepping onto a straight passageway. It was built from small, neatly stacked stones—flat and smooth beneath his feet. On both sides of the path grew the same fiery-red weeds he had encountered earlier, yet these were different. The ones outside had looked lifeless and withered, but here they gleamed like they’d been soaked in fresh blood, faintly exuding a metallic, bloody scent. Glancing around, Yang Kai could vaguely see that countless bones lay entangled within the weeds.

He started inwardly; he knew these bones must belong to warriors who had once entered the Flowing Flame Sandland, inadvertently wandered here, could not leave, and died miserably, leaving their remains behind.

He simply could not understand why their skeletons appeared here rather than inside that maze.

While inwardly alarmed, Yang Kai suddenly saw the grasses along the passage erupt into frenzied growth like demons dancing — what had been one chi high blades grew into several zhang, then into more than ten zhang in the blink of an eye...

Their long, knife-like leaves softened into whip-like strands, one after another, and frenziedly swept toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was startled — he had never expected these weeds to undergo such a change. Just a few days ago, he had tested their toughness and sharpness himself. Even he hadn’t dared to slice at his own body with their blades; a bit too much force would leave a mark on his skin, and the leaves couldn’t be broken no matter how hard he tried.

If not for the danger, he would have wanted to bring some back for Yang Yan to examine — Yang Yan was peculiar and knew many things others did not; perhaps she would recognize these grasses.

But now the countless blades along the passage had become millions of sharp whips sweeping toward him; how could he remain composed?

Before he could mount a defense, an energy membrane flared to life along the passage, and all those sweeping blades were stopped.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's expression turned strange.

Earlier he had thought the maze was naturally generated, and had been ready to keep believing that — after all, the formation was too clever, even his World-Ending Demon Eye could not find an array eye.

But the current events made him waver in that assumption; the energy membrane alone could not have arisen naturally.

This was man-made; one could even say the maze itself was laid by human hands!

Who could possess such capability?

Only Saint King Realm warriors could enter the Flowing Flame Sandland — could a warrior of that rank arrange such a grand scheme? Only someone with formation knowledge comparable to Yang Yan could.

But why would they set these measures in place?

Yang Kai strolled forward at leisure, his head filled with wild guesses; the grass-blades still swept madly, yet he treated them as nothing.
