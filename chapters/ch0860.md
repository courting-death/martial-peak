## Chapter 860 — Someday...

In the endless snowy mountains, Yang Kai and Wu Jie were running for their lives, with Xueli trailing them like a shadow, the gap between them steadily closing.

Wu Jie was drenched in cold sweat; though Xueli’s aura was still some distance away, it felt as venomous and terrifying as a snake.

Suddenly Yang Kai halted. He sent out his divine sense, scanned briefly, then turned and looked toward a direction, his face lighting up with joy. "Here!"

In the time it took to speak, his figure shivered and he was already a hundred zhang away.

Wu Jie dared not delay and followed closely behind Yang Kai.

After a moment, Yang Kai unearthed an entrance that had been almost completely buried by snow; his face broke into a grin as he dove inside.

Seeing how familiar he seemed with the place, Wu Jie couldn’t help but look thoughtful, but he didn’t ask questions and slipped into the cavern after him.

Inside the cave the cold was biting, an icy chill that could freeze a person’s soul. The moment he entered, Wu Jie had to concentrate and gather his strength to resist the surrounding cold.

He scanned the surroundings as he followed Yang Kai forward.

After a long while Yang Kai finally stopped and stared blankly ahead.

Following his gaze, Wu Jie’s eyes widened in an instant; he staggered back a few steps and cried out in shock, "The Coffin-Bearer?"

At the far end of the cave, leaning against the rock, was a man whose body was covered in pustules and whose flesh appeared thoroughly rotten, motionless.

Wu Jie had never seen the Coffin-Bearer before, yet he recognized him at a glance.

The man carried a blood-red coffin on his back—an utterly chilling sight.

What puzzled Wu Jie was that the Coffin-Bearer seemed frozen in ice, encased in a thick layer; a heavy aura of death flowed from his body, utterly lifeless.

"Zhang Ao and Cao Guan must be looking for him," Yang Kai chuckled.

"So… you really do have some connection to the Coffin-Bearer," Wu Jie’s expression shifted; he felt, with mounting excitement, that he was on the verge of witnessing a secret the world had long speculated about.

"Yes, we’re connected!" Yang Kai admitted without hesitation. He paid Wu Jie no further mind and crouched beside the Coffin-Bearer, murmuring at his ear, "Senior, senior!"

The Coffin-Bearer gave no response.

Wu Jie frowned and watched silently. Though he felt that the Coffin-Bearer was indeed long dead as the legends said, Yang Kai’s insistence suggested he had some plan.

After calling out for a long time, the Coffin-Bearer finally showed an unusual reaction.

The deathly aura around him stirred, and the ice that bound him began to crack, as if struggling to break free.

Wu Jie narrowed his eyes and focused his attention.

Crack… crack…

The ice split into a dense web of fissures, and the oppressive death aura thickened.

With a crisp sound the ice exploded into powder. The Coffin-Bearer, who should have been dead for who knew how long, slowly opened his eyes.

Wu Jie recoiled in alarm, stumbling back a few steps.

As the Coffin-Bearer opened his eyes, an aura far stronger than Wu Jie’s suddenly poured out.

The presence of a Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

In other words, the Coffin-Bearer was—or had been—a Saint Realm expert at the Second Stage.

At the very least, he had possessed that realm in life.

But his eyes were dim and lifeless, like those of a dead fish, and utterly terrifying.

"Senior, I have to go in!" Yang Kai said, staring at the Coffin-Bearer. He didn’t know if the man could understand, but he had to take the chance.

Fortunately, the Coffin-Bearer seemed to understand. His dull eyes brightened for a moment, conveying joy and excitement, and the hulking, mountain-like figure slowly rose to his feet.

A thick stench of death and rot wafted from him, laced with potent toxins that turned the crystalline cave foul.

Even someone as strong as Wu Jie felt dizzy; he held his breath and strained to keep steady.

A red light suddenly emanated from the blood coffin behind the Coffin-Bearer, and the tightly sealed lid began to split open.

Yang Kai grinned. "Thanks, senior."

Without further ado he seized the wary Wu Jie and leaped into the blood coffin.

At that moment Xueli, who was rushing over as fast as she could, eyes alight, cried out, "Demonic qi? The aura of the Great Demon God?"

She quickened her pace, seeming almost impatient to reach the source of that exhilarating presence.

……

Mogu Castle.

The leader of the Ancient Demon Clan, Li Rong, stood quietly atop the fortress, gazing at the chaotic sky with a curious expression, as if waiting for something.

Footsteps sounded behind her. Li Rong didn’t need to turn to know Han Fei had arrived.

Sure enough, after a moment Han Fei, dressed plainly and elegantly, joined her at her side and they both stared up at the heavens.

One carried an air of grace, the other an image of icy purity; a breeze stirred their hair and robes, making them the most beautiful sight in this corner of the Small Xuan Realm.

Many disciples of the Ancient Demon Clan passed below. Those who glimpsed the poetic scene lingered in admiration.

But when they remembered the ruthless methods of Lady Li Rong and Lady Han Fei, they shrank back and hurried away, not daring to stare.

"Ah—" Han Fei sighed softly and parted her lips. "Lady, do you remember how long it’s been?"

Li Rong shook her head. "There are no sun, moon, or stars here; I can’t grasp the passage of time, but at the very least five or six years, I suppose."

"Maybe longer," Han Fei murmured, nodding slightly.

"When will we see the outside world again?" Li Rong sighed faintly.

"That depends on that one’s growth."

"Yes—everything depends on how long it takes him to grow. When he left, he only had seven or eight levels of the Divine Roaming Realm, and his alchemy seemed at Spirit-Grade. To refine a Middle-Level Saint-Grade pill would take at least a decade or more."

"If Lady Li Rong thinks highly of him, then raising his alchemy isn’t the hard part; to make a Saint Pill you also need matching cultivation. He must not lag in his cultivation—are a mere ten-odd years really enough?" Han Fei tilted her head and brushed a lock of hair behind her ear.

"If ten years isn’t enough, then wait twenty, thirty years. Someday our clan will leave here," Li Rong smiled gently, a look of longing on her face.

The Ancient Demon Clan had been sealed within this place far too long; generation after generation had grown old and died without hope of escape. Now at last a glimmer appeared in their generation, and that person even possessed the World-Ending Demon Eye.

Li Rong and Han Fei both believed this was the Great Demon God’s arrangement, that fate had destined this person to free them from the Small Xuan Realm.

"We can wait, but he’s alone on his path; who knows if some accident will befall him?" Han Fei said with worry.

Li Rong’s heart tightened; she didn’t dare think further.

This worry was her deepest fear as well.

With Yang Kai’s talent, barring accidents, he should reach the level they require; the real fear was that something unforeseen would happen outside.

The Ancient Demon Clan was sealed in the Small Xuan Realm and could not step out to help him even if they wished.

"Even if he doesn’t meet our expectations, at least have him come by to say he’s safe when he has time," Li Rong said in a half-complaint.

It would be easy for Yang Kai to enter—he only needed to find a Coffin-Servant, and he could come and go at will; they would lend their strength when it came time to leave.

So Li Rong could not understand why Yang Kai had given no news for so long.

Han Fei’s expression darkened. "Hua Mo said… he might not come back."

"What do you think?" Li Rong asked, turning to her.

"I think he will return!" Han Fei answered without hesitation. "When he left he quietly left us a lot of crystal stones; that’s not the act of someone cold and heartless. If he didn’t plan to come back, there was no need to leave those things. He left the crystal stones so we could develop while he grows, so that one day when he can bring us out we can assist him."

Li Rong pursed her lips and smiled. "I think the same. Hua Mo… doesn’t know him well, so suspicion is inevitable.”

Han Fei nodded and then, excited, added, "Thanks to the crystal stones and pills he left, our clan’s cultivation levels have advanced rapidly in recent years. Two new leaders have even reached the Saint Realm, and both Hua Mo and I are close to breakthroughs."

"Indeed, we owe him thanks," Li Rong said, clearly pleased.

Before he left, Yang Kai had left a large sum of crystal stones and pills, things the Ancient Demon Clan desperately needed.

Sealed here for countless years, their crystal stones had long been spent and they couldn’t refine pills; in the past they had to directly consume the spiritual herbs they gathered. Now with pills, the effects were far superior.

"Those two newly promoted leaders—have their cultivations stabilized?" Li Rong asked with concern.

"They have stabilized. Hua Mo has been teaching them the mysteries of the Saint Realm, and they’re grasping it quickly."

"Good…"

"Let’s go back, my lord; it’s getting windy here."

"Mm." Li Rong cast one more lingering glance at the sky and walked back with Han Fei.

At that moment a crackling sound came from the sky. The two beauties stopped and looked up; in an instant their eyes trembled and delighted expressions spread across their faces.

In the heavens a sudden flash of crimson light split the sky like a thunderbolt and fell toward a spot dozens of li from Mogu Castle.

From within that red light they even caught the silhouette of a figure familiar to them descending.
