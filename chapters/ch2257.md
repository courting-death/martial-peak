## Chapter 2257 — Picked Up on the Road

“Hmph! Even trash dares to act up in front of this old man? This is your end!” After landing his blow, Gao Shan clasped his hands behind his back and declared with an air of accomplishment.

“He’s just a young man who’s only cultivated for a few years. Did he really think he could contend with us? Utterly overestimating himself.” Liu Shui sneered coldly.

“And what’s my end?” Suddenly, Luo Yuan’s voice came from the center of the chaotic energy. As he spoke, a point of light flickered there, instantly expanding into an invisible force that pushed all the energy away.

Luo Yuan reappeared before everyone, a thick, solid layer of Origin Qi that protected his body, as firm as a fortress. The bright light nearly blinded Gao Shan and Liu Shui, making their eyes ache.

Not only was he completely unharmed, but even the round-faced girl who had been standing behind him was untouched. She only seemed slightly annoyed at being disturbed, frowning and glaring at Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

“Th-this...” Gao Shan couldn’t help but take a few steps back, staring at Luo Yuan as if he’d seen a ghost, unable to believe his eyes.

“How is this possible?” Liu Shui cried out. He knew exactly how powerful Gao Shan’s attack had been. Even if Luo Yuan was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, there was no way he should have taken it head-on without injury. Yet the truth was right before him, and he was utterly shocked.

“I was just worried I couldn’t find a worthy opponent!” Luo Yuan grinned savagely, his fierce smile sending chills down everyone’s spines. “Since you’ve come to me, I won’t be polite...”

As he spoke, he even licked his lips, like a starving man seeing a delicious meal.

This sight gave Gao Shan and Liu Shui quite a fright.

As soon as he finished, Luo Yuan slowly raised a hand, his powerful Origin Qi surging within, making a sound like waves crashing against rocks.

“Stop!” At the critical moment, a delicate shout rang out.

Luo Yuan frowned and turned toward the source of the voice, finding it was Qin Yu again. His face turned cold. “What is it now?”

Earlier, when he was about to attack Yang Kai, Qin Yu had stopped him. Now, as he was about to attack Gao Shan and Liu Shui, she stopped him again. If she weren’t the master of this place, Luo Yuan wouldn’t have bothered with her at all.

“What do you think you’re doing?” Qin Yu stared at Luo Yuan coldly, gritting her teeth.

“Isn’t it obvious...” Luo Yuan replied. “Can’t you see what I’m about to do?”

“I can see it.” Qin Yu showed no fear despite the gap in cultivation, glaring at him. “That’s exactly why I’m stopping you.”

“What do you mean? Be clear.” Luo Yuan frowned, looking annoyed.

“Are you planning to tear down my Qin Family’s home?” Qin Yu asked.

“I have no such intention,” Luo Yuan answered seriously.

“Then don’t fight here!” Qin Yu snorted. “If you don’t want to sleep on the street, go fight somewhere else!”

“Hmm...” Luo Yuan thought for a moment, then nodded. “That makes sense.”

After all, the Eight Directions Sect group was staying at the Qin Family. If he really destroyed their home, not only would they have nowhere to stay, but it would also look bad.

He looked up at Gao Shan and Liu Shui. “You two old things, come with me!”

With that, he flickered and shot out of the city, passing right between Gao Shan and Liu Shui as he left, full of provocation.

How could Gao Shan and Liu Shui tolerate such arrogance from a junior? They roared in anger and chased after him.

In the blink of an eye, the three Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts disappeared from everyone’s sight.

“Sigh...” The round-faced girl who had been standing behind Luo Yuan let out a long sigh, looking forlorn.

From beginning to end, Luo Yuan hadn’t looked at her once, leaving her heartbroken. She glared at Yang Kai and pouted, “It’s all your fault!”

“My fault?” Yang Kai chuckled.

“If you hadn’t stirred up trouble, Senior Brother Luo wouldn’t have run off.” The round-faced girl pouted, looking cute and playful.

“Then shouldn’t you thank me?” Yang Kai smiled.

“Thank you for what?” The round-faced girl glanced at Yang Kai, mocking him. “What do you have that’s worth thanking for?”

Yang Kai replied matter-of-factly, “Of course there is. If I hadn’t meddled, you wouldn’t have seen how much your Senior Brother Luo cares about you.”

“Senior Brother Luo cares about me?” The round-faced girl frowned, a blush appearing on her face. She stomped her foot and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. Senior Brother Luo... only cares about martial arts, not me...” After a pause, she asked hopefully, “Tell me, how does Senior Brother Luo care about me?”

Before Yang Kai could answer, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Miss, you’re too close to see clearly. When Protector Gao Shan attacked, were you hurt at all?”

“No!” The round-faced girl shook her head.

“Who protected you?” Qin Yu asked again.

Hearing this, the girl’s eyes brightened, her previous gloom vanishing. She beamed as if she’d received a great reward.

Qin Yu said, “If your Senior Brother Luo really didn’t care about you, you’d be badly hurt by now.”

“He... he only did it in passing, not because he cares about me.” The round-faced girl lowered her head, fidgeting shyly, her cheeks flushed red, the look of a bashful young maiden written all over her face. Though her words said otherwise, anyone could see her heart was as sweet as if she’d tasted honey.

“But... aren’t you worried about your Senior Brother Luo? Gao Shan and Liu Shui may be odd, but they’re not easy to deal with.” Yang Kai suddenly asked, tapping his own head.

The round-faced girl replied, “What’s there to worry about? Those two will be crying for their mothers soon!”

She looked supremely confident in Luo Yuan.

Then her eyes sparkled and she smiled slyly. “You have time to talk? You’d better worry about yourself first.”

“What do I have to worry about...” Yang Kai sneered, glancing around. “Just a bunch of trash!”

“What did you say!”

“This brat is too arrogant. He needs a lesson.”

“Whose brat is this, talking so shamelessly? Didn’t your elders teach you manners?”

The surrounding cultivators began to shout.

With the three strongest gone, the rest had no more scruples. Each one stared greedily at the Myriad Sword in Yang Kai’s hand, their minds scheming.

“Hehehe...” Suddenly, a middle-aged old man gave a sly smile and looked kindly at Yang Kai. “Young Brother, where did you get that sword?”

“You mean this?” Yang Kai held the Myriad Sword across his chest, running his fingers along it. Sword light flashed and sword aura flowed. He smiled, “Picked it up on the road.”

“Then it must be the one I lost a few days ago! No wonder it looks so familiar. Young Brother, hurry and give it back!” The old man said quickly.

The surrounding cultivators stared at the old man in disbelief, thinking: That’s shameless! If you want to snatch the treasure, at least come up with a better excuse. Even a fool wouldn’t believe that.

“If I picked it up, it’s mine. Why should I give it to you?” Yang Kai’s face darkened, and he put the Myriad Sword away.

The old man swallowed hard and said urgently, “Young Brother, if you give me the sword, I’ll guarantee you a life of wealth and honor. You may not know, but I’m Qu Huairen, Deputy Valley Lord of Evil Moon Valley. My word is good as gold.”

Yang Kai stared at him. “I don’t believe you.”

“If you don’t believe me, ask them—they can vouch for me.” The old man pointed at the others.

The surrounding cultivators just sneered, all acting like it had nothing to do with them.

“See, they don’t believe you either.” Yang Kai mocked. “You’re just trying to trick me out of my treasure!”

Qu Huairen grew anxious, flashes of vicious light in his eyes. With a cold snort, he said, “Very well, very well. Since you, brat, refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit, you can’t blame this old man for being ruthless.”

As he spoke, he suddenly moved, spreading his arms like a great roc and pouncing at Yang Kai, his hand forming a claw, his expression fierce.

“What... what are you doing!” Yang Kai feigned panic, retreating quickly.

“Hehehe... Blame your bad luck, boy. To show off such a treasure at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm is digging your own grave. Next life, remember: a man without sin is envied for his treasure!” He spoke earnestly, but his hand never stopped, murderous intent pressing down on Yang Kai.

“I... I’ll fight you!” Yang Kai shouted, his voice booming like thunder, making everyone’s ears ring. The onlookers, seeing the old man attack, all changed expressions, and some began to secretly gather their Origin Qi, ready to act after the clash.

At that shout, everyone paused for a moment.

Where Yang Kai stood, light flashed as he summoned the Myriad Sword again. He swung it about clumsily, seemingly overwhelmed by Qu Huairen’s aura and unable to use his strength.

“Hand it over!” Qu Huairen was overjoyed, reaching for the Myriad Sword, his face full of excitement, as if he could already see himself ruling the world with the treasure.

Sssst—

Pfft—

Five severed fingers flew through the air, blood spraying everywhere.

“Uh...” Qu Huairen stood not far from Yang Kai, frozen in place, staring at him in shock, as if he hadn’t realized what had happened. He only felt a chill on his hand and chest, and waves of pain.

The next moment, he saw a mocking smile appear on Yang Kai’s lips—a smile that made him shiver, suddenly sensing something was very wrong.
