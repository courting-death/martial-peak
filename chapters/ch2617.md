## Chapter 2617 — Black Armor City

Turning his head, Yang Kai smiled and said, “Lady Feng, would you like to come along as well? The scenery in the Northern Territory is absolutely stunning—blessed with outstanding people and beautiful mountains and rivers. It’s worth taking a look.”

“Keep dreaming!” Luan Feng shot him a glare.

This guy even wanted to drag her along as a free bodyguard—how shameless! She had already considered her task done after sending him out of the Ancient Land, but out of obligation, she’d accompanied him to the Netherworld Sect. Now, who would want to go with him to the Northern Territory?

“If you don’t want to go, then don’t. Why get so angry?” Yang Kai rubbed his nose.

Off to the side, Fu Bo watched with his heart pounding, unable to figure out what kind of background Yang Kai had to be so close with the Divine Spirit Luan Feng. But one thing he did know—this young man was absolutely not someone to provoke.

After waiting less than half an hour, a woman’s voice came from outside the hall: “Sect Master, your subordinate requests an audience!”

“Come in!” Fu Bo called out quickly. Having spent half an hour here with Yang Kai and Luan Feng, he felt like he was sitting on pins and needles. Now, seeing a savior arrive, his face lit up with joy.

As footsteps approached, a woman in palace attire walked in from outside.

This woman was also quite beautiful, dressed with dignified composure. Her cultivation was at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, so her status in the Netherworld Sect was clearly not low.

Entering the hall, the woman glanced curiously at Yang Kai and the other two. She had no idea who this man and two women were, yet they were in the Sect Master’s closed cultivation area. As far as she knew, not just anyone could enter here. Even elders like herself couldn’t set foot here without being summoned.

“Where is it?” Fu Bo asked the beautiful woman.

The woman quickly replied, “It’s ready.”

As she spoke, she handed Fu Bo a Spatial Ring.

Fu Bo took it. Sweeping it with his Divine Sense, a faint look of pain flashed across his face, but he quickly hid it and waved the woman off. “You may go.”

“Sect Master!” The woman didn’t leave immediately, but instead looked at Fu Bo curiously. “Why did you suddenly need one hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals in such a hurry?”

As the chief steward of the entire Netherworld Sect, she managed the sect’s treasury and all cultivation resources. Although she had taken out one hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals from the treasury, she had to ask about their use. After all, the amount was enormous. With so many Source Crystals gone, the disciples’ cultivation resources would be drastically reduced for years to come.

When the disciples complained, she would be the one blamed.

“Cultivation,” Fu Bo replied blandly, not even lifting his eyelids.

The woman was stunned, then suddenly overjoyed. “Sect Master, could it be that you…”

Fu Bo waved his hand. “Don’t ask so many questions.”

The beautiful woman hurriedly cupped her fists and replied, “Yes, Sect Master!” Yet, despite her best efforts, she couldn’t hide the joy that flickered in her eyes.

She thought the Sect Master was taking so many Source Crystals because he sensed a chance for a breakthrough. Fu Bo was already at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm—if he broke through again, he would reach the level of a Great Emperor. If that happened, the Netherworld Sect would surely rise with him.

Compared to the Sect Master’s cultivation, what did one hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals matter? The woman was instantly relieved.

“Then I’ll take my leave!” The woman respectfully saluted and prepared to go.

“Yes, and prepare the Space Array as well. I’ll be sending these guests off shortly,” Fu Bo instructed again.

The woman received the order and left in high spirits.

After she left, Fu Bo’s face showed a trace of embarrassment as he tossed the Spatial Ring to Yang Kai.

As the current Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect, Fu Bo felt his face burn with shame at having to lie in front of Yang Kai and the others. No matter how thick-skinned he was, it was still hard to swallow. But what else could he do? Was he supposed to admit to his own subordinates that he’d just been extorted?

He really couldn’t bring himself to say that.

Yang Kai took the Spatial Ring, swept it with his Divine Sense, didn’t bother counting, and put it away casually.

He trusted Fu Bo wouldn’t play any tricks. If he said one hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals, then it was one hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals!

Suddenly coming into a windfall, Yang Kai was in a great mood. Counting the gains from the last time in the Wild Ancient Land, he now had seven or eight hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals on hand.

That number was simply terrifying.

“Sect Master Fu is truly sincere!” Yang Kai laughed heartily. “Since Sect Master Fu is so sincere, the grudges between me and the Netherworld Sect are now settled. From now on, we’ll mind our own business. What do you think, Sect Master Fu?”

“Excellent, excellent!” How could Fu Bo dare say otherwise?

Yang Kai said, “There’s still the second matter I’ll need your sect’s help with!”

“Please, follow me!” Fu Bo didn’t hesitate and quickly led the way.

Leaving the palace, the four of them immediately flew off in one direction.

Upon reaching a mountain peak, Fu Bo led Yang Kai and the others to the flat summit, where a palace stood. Even before entering, Yang Kai could sense a clear fluctuation of space power coming from within.

That was the fluctuation of the Space Array being activated.

It seemed the woman who left earlier had indeed made the preparations.

Entering the hall, the disciples guarding the Space Array of the Netherworld Sect greeted them respectfully. The woman who had delivered the Spatial Ring hurried over and cupped her fists. “Sect Master, everything is ready. Where should the destination be set?”

“Black Armor City,” Fu Bo replied calmly.

The woman nodded and signaled to the disciples by the Space Array. They immediately began making adjustments.

In no time, the Space Array was ready.

Fu Bo smiled and gestured, “Please!”

Yang Kai led Ji Yao forward, standing at the center of the Space Array. He then looked at Luan Feng with a smile. “Lady Feng, are you really not coming along?”

Luan Feng replied expressionlessly, “Safe travels, Sir Yang.”

Yang Kai chuckled. “Then thank you, Lady Feng, for escorting us all this way. If I have the chance, I’ll visit to thank you again.”

Luan Feng’s mouth twitched, forcing a strained smile. She said nothing more. At this moment, silence was golden!

Yang Kai turned to the Netherworld Sect disciples. “Begin!”

The disciples glanced at Fu Bo. After he nodded, they fully activated the Space Array.

A bright light flashed, and the Upper-Level Source Crystals placed on the Space Array were instantly drained of energy, turning to dust.

As the light faded, Yang Kai and Ji Yao’s figures vanished as well.

“Whew…” Luan Feng let out a gentle breath, thinking that she’d finally sent this little ancestor off. She was in a great mood, her smile blooming like a flower.

Turning around, she didn’t even bother to say anything to Fu Bo, but left the palace and flew away.

Fu Bo led a group of Netherworld Sect disciples outside the hall to see them off with cupped fists.

“Sect Master…” The woman now looked utterly confused, having noticed that her Sect Master was extremely respectful and wary toward that woman. The other didn’t even acknowledge him, yet he came out to see her off himself.

“Who was that woman just now?” The woman couldn’t help but ask the question in her heart.

Before Fu Bo could answer, a distant cry suddenly echoed from the sky, clear and melodious, resounding through the clouds.

Vaguely, a massive figure was seen soaring among the clouds, soon disappearing from sight.

As expected…

Fu Bo’s eyes narrowed, a chill running down his spine as a wave of lingering fear washed over him. He’d long suspected Luan Feng’s true identity, but without proof, he could only guess. Now, hearing that cry and witnessing the colossal figure weaving through the clouds, he knew without a doubt—his suspicions had been right all along.

That one was truly a Saint Venerable from the Wild Ancient Land!

Ordinary cultivators didn’t know much about the Ancient Land, but at Fu Bo’s level, he’d learned some hidden secrets through various channels—including the power structure of the Wild Ancient Land!

If not for the Four Great Saint Venerables and Thirty-Two Yao Kings holding down the Ancient Land, that vast treasure trove would have been carved up by the major forces of the Star Realm long ago.

“Don’t ask so much. Just do your job!” Fu Bo replied blandly.

“Yes!” The woman answered respectfully, then suddenly said, “By the way, Sect Master, I heard from the disciples that the Great Elder went to see you earlier. Why isn’t he here?”

Fu Bo’s mouth twitched, and he let out a heavy sigh. “Zhou Yong… is dead.”

“What?” The woman was shocked. “The Great Elder is dead? Who killed him?”

“He provoked someone he shouldn’t have.” Fu Bo explained briefly, then glanced at the woman. “Elder Zhuo, you’re far too curious.”

With that, he flickered away in a stream of light, heading back to his closed cultivation area.

Elder Zhuo still stood there in a daze, seemingly unable to digest the news that the Great Elder was dead, her face full of shock. If she knew that even the Vice Sect Master was dead, who knows how she’d react.

…

The Black Armor City lay at the far edge of the Eastern Territory, just fifty thousand kilometers from the border of the Northern Territory.

The figures of Yang Kai and Ji Yao gradually appeared on the Space Array within the Black Armor City.

Before the two could even steady themselves, a fierce palm strike came at them, accompanied by a loud laugh: “This one’s mine!”

“Hm?” Yang Kai was startled and turned to see a burly, bearded man flying over, slamming a palm toward his chest. He had no idea what grudge this man had with him.

But Yang Kai was sure he’d never seen this bearded man before.

“Sha Yong, the man’s yours, the woman’s mine. Damn… this woman is gorgeous! I’m in luck!” Another voice rang out, and another figure shot toward Ji Yao, his face full of lecherous intent, as if he couldn’t wait to snatch her away and enjoy her.

The bearded man called Sha Yong hadn’t paid much attention to Ji Yao before, but now, hearing this, he quickly looked her over and found she was indeed stunning—especially her cold, aloof aura, which made him want to conquer her even more.

Sha Yong turned and charged at Ji Yao as well, shouting, “Switch! Switch! Gu Peng, you took the last woman, so it’s Sha Yong’s turn this time!”
