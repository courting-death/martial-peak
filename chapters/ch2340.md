## Chapter 2340 — He Is Dead For Sure

Shi Cangying’s bloodstained, massive hand was now firmly placed atop Du Xian’s head.

Ye Qinghan and Du Xian had grown up together as childhood friends, cultivating side by side, their bond deep and unwavering. To each, the other had long become half of their own life, but as their paths had not yet reached completion, it was not yet time for marriage.

The two had secretly agreed that once they both advanced to the Emperor Realm, Du Xian would propose to Ye Qinghan, and Ye Hen would surely grant his blessing for the union.

They believed that by then, Ye Hen would certainly not refuse.

What Ye Qinghan never expected was that before that day could come, her beloved was about to be killed right before her eyes.

“No, Senior Uncle Shi, please don’t!” Ye Qinghan’s body went limp as she dropped to her knees, begging bitterly.

Shi Cangying’s face was cold and resolute, unmoved as he said indifferently, “If you undo this formation, everything can be discussed.”

Ye Qinghan was suddenly at a complete loss. Undoing the formation would mean exposing Thousand Leaves Sect’s greatest secret to the enemy, leaving them free to come and go. But if she refused, judging by Shi Cangying’s earlier ruthlessness, Du Xian would die at any moment.

She truly did not know what to do.

"Ye'er, don’t listen to him, this old dog has lost his mind." Du Xian suddenly shouted, "Even if you undo the formation, they won’t spare us. I will go on ahead—promise me you’ll live well. In the next life, I will not fail you!"

As his words fell, Origin Qi surged violently within him, reaching a level even he could not control.

“Hmph!” Shi Cangying snorted coldly, slamming his hand down hard on Du Xian’s shoulder. The raging Origin Qi was instantly extinguished, returning to calm.

Du Xian was dumbfounded. Now, he could not even self-destruct—he was completely at their mercy.

Ye Qinghan was also startled. She knew exactly what Du Xian had tried to do. Seeing Shi Cangying seal his cultivation, she even felt a trace of gratitude toward this traitor. If not for his timely intervention, Du Xian would have self-destructed right before her eyes, and she knew she could not bear such an outcome.

This sudden turn completely shattered Ye Qinghan’s mental defenses. Though she knew that undoing the formation would likely end badly, she still clung to a sliver of hope. With tear-filled eyes, she looked at Shi Cangying and pleaded, “Senior Uncle, I’ll undo the formation, but… let them go. They’re not of Thousand Leaves Sect, this has nothing to do with them!”

She was, of course, referring to Chi Yue and the others.

Hearing this, Ye Hen slowly closed his eyes. He knew there was truly no hope left. If Ye Qinghan had kept guarding the formation, there might have been a slim chance, but if she undid it, the outcome would be tragic.

But now, he could not move, could not even speak, and was powerless to stop anything.

Du Xian was also desperately shaking his head at Ye Qinghan, but it was all in vain.

Shi Cangying said coldly, “This is not something Senior Uncle can decide.”

As soon as he finished, Qiu Ze spoke magnanimously, “Very well. This Lord agrees to your request. Just undo the formation obediently.”

“As if anyone would believe you!” Hua Qingsi muttered softly. She knew Qiu Ze was just making empty promises, with no intention of letting them go.

In the valley, Ye Qinghan wiped her tears and looked at Chi Yue and the others. “It’s my Thousand Leaves Sect that dragged you into this. When I open the formation, you must run at once. I’ll try to buy you some time.”

Hua Qingsi frowned and replied, “Miss Ye, come with us.”

She understood Ye Qinghan’s predicament—her father and beloved’s lives were in the enemy’s hands, so she could not just stand by. Thus, Hua Qingsi did not blame her.

But… Qiu Ze was still here. She had no confidence she could escape with Chi Yue and the others. If it were just her, she might have a seventy or eighty percent chance. She could not defeat Qiu Ze, but she might be able to run.

But Chi Yue and the others were only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and Chai Hu was just at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. To escape from so many experts was a fool’s dream.

Hua Qingsi resolved that no matter what, she would protect Chi Yue and the others, and wait for Yang Kai to return.

Facing Hua Qingsi’s invitation, Ye Qinghan only gave a bitter smile and slowly shook her head.

Hua Qingsi saw her mind was made up and could only sigh, saying no more.

“Still not moving?” Shi Cangying urged impatiently, the Origin Qi in his hand atop Du Xian’s head surging, as if ready to take his life at any moment.

Ye Qinghan’s body trembled, and she dared not delay any longer. Her hands flew as she quickly formed seals.

As the seals shot forth, the various trapping, illusion, and killing formations in the valley were undone layer by layer.

Qiu Ze released his Divine Sense, watching closely. When he sensed the formations had all been undone, he laughed and said, “Niece Ye, you know how to adapt. You’re much wiser than your father.”

After undoing the formation, Ye Qinghan felt utterly weak, as if completely drained. She softly called out, “Go!”

As soon as she spoke, Hua Qingsi and the others exchanged glances and immediately prepared to flee.

But before they could move, the Formation Foundation platform began to hum, and a clear spatial fluctuation rippled out, followed by a dazzling light from the platform.

“What?” Shi Cangying, who had been rushing toward Ye Qinghan and the others, froze in place, staring blankly at the platform. He had never expected it to activate at this moment, as if someone was teleporting over.

Qiu Ze’s eyes also lit up, staring unblinkingly at the scene.

Earlier, he had thought the Formation Foundation platform was broken. Otherwise, why hadn’t Ye Qinghan and the others escaped, instead of being trapped in the valley? But what he saw now proved otherwise.

Someone was teleporting from elsewhere—did that mean the platform was functional? Who was coming, and where was it connected to?

Unlike Shi Cangying and Qiu Ze’s confusion, Ye Hen’s eyes suddenly widened, his body trembling uncontrollably as he saw the light.

The entrance to the secret realm… had been restored!

The entrance, sealed for tens of thousands of years, had finally been repaired today.

For generations, every Sect Master of Thousand Leaves Sect had devoted themselves to restoring the secret realm’s entrance, but none had succeeded. Yet now, he had witnessed it with his own eyes.

In that instant, Ye Hen felt that even death would bring no regrets, and he could not help but laugh foolishly.

As long as the entrance was restored, Thousand Leaves Sect’s legacy would not be severed, and there was hope to restore the Sect’s glory.

But thinking of his and Thousand Leaves Sect’s current plight, Ye Hen’s heart sank again.

He knew exactly who had restored the entrance—after all, only Yang Kai had entered recently. Who else could it be? He was gratified by his daughter’s judgment, but also bitter that fate had not granted Thousand Leaves Sect a few more days.

With just a few more days, Ye Hen was confident he could obtain the lost arts and secret techniques from the secret realm, and then control the Earth-Grade puppets on the main peak’s plaza.

With those Earth-Grade puppets, Thousand Leaves Sect would not have fallen so low. Even if they could not defeat Qiu Ze and the others, they could at least fight to a draw.

But as it happened, the entrance was restored at this very moment.

Now, not only was Thousand Leaves Sect doomed, but its legacy of tens of thousands of years would fall into others’ hands.

He felt that Yang Kai alone could not possibly stop Qiu Ze, an Emperor Realm expert.

As he was lost in thought, two figures gradually appeared on the Formation Foundation platform. One was Yang Kai, and the other was a little girl, only seven or eight years old, with fiery red hair cascading to her ankles, smooth as a waterfall and strikingly eye-catching. She wore an adult’s robe—clearly Yang Kai’s—which hung loosely and looked odd, but instead of ruining her beauty, it added a touch of playful cuteness. Her rosy cheeks made one want to pinch them at a glance.

When the two appeared, they had not yet figured out the situation. Only when they caught the faint scent of blood did Yang Kai’s expression darken, and his Divine Sense swept out.

In an instant, his face turned grim.

He saw Chi Yue and the others wounded, huddled by the Formation Foundation platform; saw Ye Hen and Du Xian immobilized, their auras weak; saw Shi Cangying hesitating, and Luo Jin glaring at him with hatred and venom.

He also sensed the presence of an Emperor Realm expert!

“Young Master Yang!” Hua Qingsi, seeing Yang Kai appear, knew their savior had arrived. She could not help but breathe a sigh of relief and said with a bitter smile, “If you’d come any later, we’d be finished.”

“Sorry, Young Master Yang…” Ye Qinghan looked at Yang Kai anxiously. “It’s my Thousand Leaves Sect that dragged you all into this.”

After a pause, she urged, “Take them and run!”

Though she had seen Yang Kai’s strength, and knew he was formidable, there was an Emperor Realm expert here. She did not believe Yang Kai could match him.

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally looked away from Qiu Ze, the corners of his mouth lifting. “The situation is a bit complicated.”

He still did not fully understand how things had come to this, but it was clear who was friend and who was foe.

“Was it that guy who hurt you?” Yang Kai asked, glancing at Qiu Ze.

Hua Qingsi was at the peak of the Dao Origin Realm. Of those present, only Qiu Ze could have injured her.

“Yes!” Hua Qingsi nodded lightly. “He seems to be the Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace, and has only just advanced to the Emperor Realm. His cultivation isn’t stable yet—otherwise, you wouldn’t have seen me again.”

“Very good. Anyone who dares hurt my people is dead for sure.” Yang Kai sneered.

As soon as he said this, everyone looked at him as if he were a fool.
