## Chapter 2471 — I Am from the Hell King's Palace

The Earth Sword, Falling Thunder was a secret technique—one Yang Kai recognized.

This secret technique was divided into three moves: Human Sword, Annihilation; Earth Sword, Falling Thunder; and Heavenly Sword, Shattering Stars. Each move was stronger than the last, and when all three were combined, their power was boundless.

The one who cultivated this secret technique was Xiao Baiyi of Qingyang Shrine. Back in the Time Temple of the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai had fought Xiao Baiyi and experienced the might of this technique firsthand, so he remembered it vividly.

Now, seeing someone use this secret technique here in the Sea of Origin, his attention was immediately drawn.

Turning his head to look, he instantly caught sight of a white-robed figure amidst the chaos of battle. Who else could it be but Xiao Baiyi?

Ever since Yang Kai had met him, this man had always been dressed in flowing white robes, exuding an air of cool detachment. But now, his situation looked dire—he was surrounded on all sides, and splashes of fresh blood stained his white clothes, the crimson spots glaringly conspicuous.

And with him was another figure Yang Kai was familiar with.

Murong Xiaoxiao!

These two elite disciples of Qingyang Shrine now stood above a small island, back to back, each unleashing secret techniques to fend off attacks from all directions. The island beneath them was just big enough for the two to stand on.

Both were elites among elites. Several years had passed since Yang Kai last saw them, and their cultivations had already reached the peak of the Third Stage Dao Origin Realm. Yet, outnumbered as they were, their situation was perilous in the extreme. Blood would occasionally spurt from Xiao Baiyi’s wounds, staining his white robes, while Murong Xiaoxiao’s once-lustrous hair was now disheveled, sweat soaking through her clothes and clinging tightly to her graceful, curvaceous figure.

When Yang Kai saw this, he noticed that those besieging them hadn’t sealed off all escape routes. In other words, Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao still had a chance to flee.

Yet neither showed any intention of escaping—one’s face was cold and resolute, the other’s expression was angry and aggrieved. They stood their ground, unleashing their power.

They were fighting over territory!

Yang Kai saw at a glance that the spot Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao occupied had clearly caught the eye of that group, so they came to seize it, thinking to bully the few with their numbers. Only after clashing did they realize that Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao were not so easily provoked.

The deliberately left gap was for Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao to escape through. This was the principle of leaving an opening in a siege—they didn’t want a fight to the death, just to drive the two away.

But Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao had no intention of fleeing, causing the battle to reach a fever pitch.

Yang Kai quickly turned and rushed over.

He was, after all, a registered disciple of Qingyang Shrine. Wen Zishan and Gao Xueting had both looked after him in many ways, and he had some friendship with Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao. How could he ignore this?

Sensing Yang Kai’s movement, one of the besiegers—a long-faced old man—shouted, “I’ll give you one last chance: will you leave or not?”

Murong Xiaoxiao bit her silver teeth and shouted, “If you want our spot, you’ll have to kill us first!”

Xiao Baiyi said nothing, but his longsword blossomed with sword flowers, the killing intent in his silent answer unmistakable.

“Very well. Since you refuse to take the path to heaven and insist on barging into hell, don’t blame us for being ruthless!” As he spoke, the long-faced old man made a quick gesture to the others, his expression turning sinister. Clearly, he had no intention of dragging things out any longer—they would end this swiftly and decisively.

The others understood at once. Their auras shifted, and their attacks became much more decisive and fierce.

Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao’s faces darkened, the pressure on them like a mountain.

The long-faced old man himself flickered and moved toward Yang Kai, cupping his fists from afar. “The Point Star Sect of the Western Territory is handling business here. Friend, please give us some face and take another path!”

“Oh? You’re from the Point Star Sect?” Not only did Yang Kai not stop, he actually sped up, looking delighted.

“That’s right. And you are?” The long-faced old man, hearing this, thought Yang Kai must also be a martial artist from the Western Territory, and looked at him suspiciously, trying to guess his background.

Yang Kai’s eyes danced as he said, “I’m from the Hell King's Palace!”

“Hell King's Palace?” The long-faced old man looked puzzled. He couldn’t recall any sect by that name in the Western Territory, but soon his face darkened. “Are you making fun of me?”

A name like Hell King's Palace would invite enmity; a real sect wouldn't use it. Clearly, Yang Kai was making it up.

Yang Kai grinned. “How could I? I really am from the Hell King's Palace…” His face suddenly turned cold and his voice grew chilling. “The Hell King sent me to take your lives!”

The long-faced old man’s expression changed as he roared, “You’re courting death, boy!”

He surged his Origin Qi, his hands forming mysterious seals, and reached out to grab Yang Kai, clearly wanting to teach him a lesson.

But to his shock, Yang Kai vanished before his eyes.

This bizarre scene left the old man stunned, for he hadn’t seen how Yang Kai disappeared at all.

In an instant, a chill swept up from his feet, making him wonder if he’d really seen a ghost.

But before he could finish the thought, Yang Kai’s face appeared before him again—this time, only three inches away, their faces nearly touching.

“Hiss…” The long-faced old man sucked in a breath. Without thinking, he pushed off with his foot to retreat, his Origin Qi surging around him as a visible shield.

Yang Kai grinned, a strange smile on his face. At his left eye, a pure white lotus bud appeared for a moment and vanished.

Blooming Lotus!

Over the past year and a half, as Yang Kai subdued the Mountain and River Bell, his Divine Sense had grown greatly. Now, using this Divine Soul secret technique felt even more natural, and its power seemed much greater than before.

The white lotus bud instantly became a mysterious force, tore through the old man’s Divine Sense defenses, and rushed into his Sea of Consciousness.

The long-faced old man, retreating in panic, suddenly froze in place, his eyes dull and his face twisted in pain.

In his vision, only the white lotus bud remained, blooming rapidly, its pure light devouring his body and mind.

Yang Kai threw a punch, and with a burst of violent power, the long-faced old man exploded into a cloud of blood mist, his body utterly destroyed, the remains scattering down toward the Sea of Origin.

“Ah!”

Cries of shock rang out. The others attacking Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao were all stunned by what they saw.

Though the long-faced old man was a bit older, his strength was nothing to scoff at. Among the Dao Origin Realm cultivators of the Point Star Sect in the Western Territory, he ranked in the top three. Yet such a man had been blown apart by a single punch from a young man who’d appeared out of nowhere, with no chance to resist.

Just a moment ago, he’d been urging them to finish things quickly—how had he suddenly died?

Could the one who killed him be an Emperor Realm master?

There weren’t many Emperor Realm cultivators in the Shattered Star Sea, but there were definitely some.

The old man’s bloody end left the Point Star Sect disciples terrified. Their suspicions made their hearts pound, and seeing Yang Kai charging over with a cold smile, none of them dared linger.

They immediately abandoned Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao and fled into the distance, not even daring to think of revenge—only escape.

“Condense!” Yang Kai reached out and clenched his fist. As the Laws of Space surged, that area instantly solidified.

The fleeing disciples stared in horror, only to find their speed had slowed to a crawl, sweat beading on their foreheads as they grew cold with fear.

Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao were overjoyed at the sight. They didn’t know who had helped them, nor did they have time to look. Having been stifled by these Point Star Sect disciples, they could finally unleash their pent-up fury.

“Human Sword, Annihilation!”

“Earth Sword, Falling Thunder!”

“Heavenly Sword, Shattering Stars!”

Xiao Baiyi’s longsword danced, unleashing all three secret sword techniques at once. The combined might shook even the heavens and earth.

Though Murong Xiaoxiao was a woman and usually gave Yang Kai a gentle, elegant impression, she showed no mercy now. She summoned her Feathered Heaven Ring, which split into two, then four, then eight, layer upon layer enveloping the Point Star Sect disciples.

Screams rang out one after another. The Point Star Sect disciples had only wanted to escape and had no will to fight. After being suddenly restrained by Yang Kai, they couldn’t even resist.

With the two Qingyang Shrine disciples attacking, the enemies fell like straw.

In an instant, blood and flesh filled the sky, severed limbs flying everywhere.

In less than ten breaths, the Point Star Sect disciples were all killed on the spot, their bodies falling toward the Sea of Origin below.

One after another, Star Seals shot from the backs of their hands, flying toward Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao, who quickly divided them up.

“Thank you for your help, Senior Brother… Eh, it’s Senior Brother Yang!” Murong Xiaoxiao turned around, intending to thank her savior, but immediately saw Yang Kai’s face and cried out in delight.

She had been wondering who had helped her and Xiao Baiyi, but hadn’t expected it to be Yang Kai.

Xiao Baiyi said nothing, just turned to look at Yang Kai with a face that said he’d known it all along, acting as cool as ever.

After all, back in the Time Temple, when he fought Yang Kai, Yang Kai had used space powers. So the moment he sensed the fluctuation of space just now, Xiao Baiyi guessed it was Yang Kai.

Now, turning to look, he saw he was right.

“Miss Murong, it’s been years—you’ve grown even more beautiful!” Yang Kai flew over with a grin, greeting Murong Xiaoxiao.

Murong Xiaoxiao blushed and stomped her foot. “Senior Brother Yang, you’re teasing me.”

“I’m not teasing you, just speaking the truth!” Yang Kai said solemnly.

Murong Xiaoxiao’s face turned even redder.
