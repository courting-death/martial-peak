## Chapter 1735 — Gu Jianxin

Hidden somewhere within the Meteorite Sea, Yang Kai concealed his form and aura. He believed that even if the other side had a Void King Realm expert, with them separated by a hundred li, it would be impossible for them to detect his trace.

He once more checked on the condition of the Stone Puppet.

It had been because he sensed peculiar changes in the Stone Puppet that he had chosen to take shelter in this stretch of the Meteorite Sea, only to be discovered and attacked by Li Minghai.

Now, while waiting, his attention naturally returned to the Stone Puppet.

At a glance, Yang Kai was instantly overjoyed.

The layer that enveloped the Stone Puppet like a stone cocoon had actually split with fissures here and there, just as it had when the Stone Puppet was first born; it was clear that the Stone Puppet was about to break free from its shell once more.

The Spatial Ring was not a suitable place, nor was the Meteorite Sea; Yang Kai did not know whether this evolution of the Stone Puppet would cause any obvious signs, and staying here would only allow Li Minghai and the others to discover them.

With no other choice, Yang Kai produced the Xuan Realm Pearl and dove into the Small Xuan Realm with the Stone Puppet.

Since he had brought the elite human, yao, and demon fighters from Tongxuan Continent to Lingxiao Sect, the Small Xuan Realm had been left vacant once more; now that Yang Kai had arrived, it remained tranquil and silent within.

The stone cocoon lay directly before Yang Kai; he stared at it in silence.

After a long while, the cocoon began to creak; existing cracks widened, multiplied, and grew ever denser.

In the end, when the cocoon was covered in fissures, the Stone Puppet exploded forth from it.

Xiaoxiao landed nimbly before Yang Kai. Where its eyes had once only possessed a faint divine aura, they now shone dazzlingly, as if imbued with the light of intelligence.

It discovered Yang Kai watching it. The Stone Puppet actually bared a faint smile, then stood there and scratched its head with arms long enough to reach its knees.

Yang Kai stroked his chin and released his Divine Sense to sweep over the Stone Puppet.

"No particularly special changes!" After a moment he murmured, a puzzled expression crossing his face.

He had expected this evolution of the Stone Puppet to bring earth-shattering changes, but now it seemed his hopes had been somewhat excessive. The Stone Puppet did look different than before; after all, on that Dead Star it had devoured a great deal of precious ore.

Having refined the essence of those minerals, the Stone Puppet would surely have gained some amplification in both force and sturdiness.

It was akin to a martial artist taking a Spiritual Pill used in cultivation; their strength would inevitably increase.

But to say there were drastic changes—there were none!

The Stone Puppet’s eyes were indeed a bit brighter; its intellect had clearly increased somewhat, but it had not reached any heaven-defying degree.

"Grow bigger so I can see!" Yang Kai ordered the Stone Puppet.

At his command, the Stone Puppet instantly transformed into a Stone Giant, standing ten zhang tall. Its imposing might radiated, the sense of pressure tremendous!

"What about the lava armor?" Yang Kai asked.

The surface of the Stone Puppet’s body immediately shimmered with the scorching Sun’s True Fire, turning its entire form crimson; the layer of armor that covered it flowed like molten rock—terrifying and dreadful.

"Indeed, nothing too significant has changed!" Yang Kai frowned and pondered. He could not fathom the reason; by all rights, the Stone Puppet’s consumption of a fragment of the Dead Star’s residual origin should have brought great benefit.

After all, upon devouring it, its reaction had been extremely intense—it had even become a stone cocoon.

But the ultimate result was somewhat surprising.

Unable to make sense of it for the moment, Yang Kai did not press the matter. In any case, the road ahead was long and there would be time to study it; after returning the Stone Puppet to its usual form, he brought it and left the Small Xuan Realm.

No sooner had he returned to the meteorite he had been hiding on than Yang Kai sensed something amiss.

A hundred li away, Li Minghai and his group simultaneously unleashed concealment-art techniques to hide their auras, almost vanishing from Yang Kai’s perception.

And far off in the distance, a warship was slowly approaching!

The warship of the Sword Alliance’s Young Alliance Master!

It had arrived so quickly; no wonder Li Minghai had shown no hesitation in striking him when he discovered him—apparently their schedule had been tight and he could not risk any mishap, so he had personally carried out the attack.

In the end, not only did they fail, but they even provoked a hidden and formidable enemy. If Li Minghai were to learn of this, one could only wonder what he would think.

Yang Kai gazed toward the warship’s position and its course and estimated that at most an hour would pass before the two parties met. He held his breath and waited for the show to begin!

Time passed bit by bit, and in the vast Meteorite Sea the atmosphere seemed to grow heavy.

As the warship drew nearer, Yang Kai realized that the Sword Alliance’s Alliance Master’s fleet consisted of more than one vessel; the central ship was somewhat larger, about thirty zhang long.

Flanking it on the left and right were two slightly smaller warships, each about twenty zhang long.

Clearly, this was a formation of three warships!

They were too far away for Yang Kai to know the exact grades of the three warships, but he was certain none would be below Origin-Grade.

The Sword Alliance had spent heavily! An Origin-Grade warship on Dark Star could be regarded as an Ancestral Treasure within a sect, yet here were three appearing together.

However, the three vessels’ designs differed from the ones Yang Yan had forged; strictly speaking they resembled large ships, especially the central one, which was like a gigantic vessel sailing through the void. Its prow’s ram was razor-sharp, and the ship’s streamlined shape from a distance resembled a drawn sword, all edge and menace.

On the decks of the three warships, figures of cultivators could be faintly seen moving about.

Unaware of the ambush hidden within the Meteorite Sea, the approaching fleet continued straight toward them. When the distance between them closed to about fifty li, Li Minghai and his companions, hidden among the meteorites, struck decisively.

Even a hundred li away, Yang Kai could clearly feel a distinct wave of energy emanating from there; this energy surge grew stronger, and in several spots of the Meteorite Sea brilliant lights flared forth.

Immediately, dozens of pure white pillars of light shot forth from the Meteorite Sea like arrows released from a bow, racing toward the three distant warships with thunderous speed.

With such blatant anomalies and such violent energy fluctuations, the three warships clearly perceived the looming danger; the cultivators on their decks hastened to warn one another and each summoned defensive Secret Treasures to shield the ships, doing their utmost.

The three warships reacted with incredible speed.

In a flash, energy membranes visible to the naked eye ignited over the vessels; they also maneuvered to evade, attempting to flee the attack zone.

But Li Minghai and his group had lain in wait for a long time and were thoroughly prepared; the timing of the ambush had been perfect, so not all of the attack could be avoided.

The dozens of white pillars of light instantly engulfed the three warships, from afar resembling towering waves that submerged three reefs.

An even brighter radiance burst from one point: the leftmost warship could not withstand the assault. Its defensive shield was first shattered, then several pillars of light pierced through the enormous hull, inflicting grievous damage—this warship exploded!

No one escaped that annihilation.

The cultivators aboard that warship and the vessel itself were utterly annihilated in Li Minghai and his companions’ first volley of strikes!

The warship on the right fared better; although its defensive shield was collapsed in a short time, it did not suffer as many hits—only two white pillars of light pierced its hull.

Though the warship was completely disabled, it did not explode, and it was unknown how many lives had been lost.

The surviving cultivators fled from the battleship in panic, each one’s escaping technique flaring as they darted out in terror, desperately searching for any trace of the enemy. But when they saw what had happened to the battleship on the left, their fear turned into a deep, bone-gnawing hatred.

Among the three warships, only the central largest vessel remained in the best condition.

Though it had endured more attacks than the other two, its grade was clearly very high; its defensive shield had not been fully broken, merely dimmed to near extinguishment.

Before the onlookers could recover, Li Minghai and his companions had already rushed forward.

The moment the assault began, Li Minghai and the others acted; they seemed to have anticipated the situation, and upon reaching the largest warship they all drew forth their attacking Secret Treasures and blasted the ship.

The already dim defense finally shattered completely.

"Li Minghai! So it was you!" A thunderous roar came from within the warship. From the voice one could tell the speaker was not old, but his rage made him sound furious. "You dare strike at my Young Master—do you know what the consequences will be?"

"I am well aware of the consequences for attacking the Alliance Master," Li Minghai replied with an indifferent expression from among the crowd, showing no panic. "I am one of the elders of the Sword Alliance, how could I not understand the Alliance’s rules? But if you think to use the rules to subdue me, wait until the Alliance Master manages to escape this calamity before you judge."

“Good. Very good! It seems you’re well prepared to face this Young Master’s boundless wrath.”
As the voice rang out from within the battleship, the figure of a young man appeared upon its deck — handsome and heroic, his bearing noble as jade. Within his eyes shimmered a razor-sharp brilliance, as though two divine swords capable of piercing the soul were hidden within their depths.

The Sword Alliance’s Young Alliance Master, Gu Jianxin!

He stood straight on the deck; even when facing a Void King Realm like Li Minghai, his face remained unchanged, his expression cold, his waist straight as a sword.

To his left and right stood two women: one tall and buxom, her glances flowing with a kind of indescribable allure, while the other was smaller and exquisitely featured, a long mane of dark hair almost reaching her hips. Though their temperaments differed, both shared Gu Jianxin’s lack of fear and instead appeared somewhat eager to test themselves.
