## Chapter 946 — Twin Pavilion

Among the nearby few thousand martial artists, hardly any were particularly powerful; only a dozen or two reached the Transcendent Realm and were worth paying attention to, while the vast majority remained at the Divine Roaming Realm or True Yuan Realm level.

This made Sun Yu and the other Dragon-Phoenix Palace experts puzzled; they had no idea where this group had come from, nor what their connection with Yang Kai was.

"They're all my friends and acquaintances," Yang Kai explained calmly before adopting a serious tone. "In any case, I must thank you for this."

Because of a single remark Yang Kai had made earlier, Sun Yu had gone all out to investigate; once he learned of the situation, he personally led people to this place.

Yang Kai was deeply grateful for that.

Back then he had no other choice, so he had mobilized every personal connection he could.

Yang Kai could imagine how many obstacles Sun Yu must have faced when he insisted on going out this time, how the people of Dragon-Phoenix Palace tried in every way to dissuade him, and how he nevertheless refused to be turned aside.

The young man was truly admirable!

"Shi Kun, when you return tell the Great Elder to spend more time cultivating ties with the Dragon-Phoenix Palace," Yang Kai said casually.

"Yes!" Shi Kun answered at once.

Chen Zhou rubbed his large hands, his smile blooming; at a loss for words, he stammered, "What am I to do?"

The Dragon-Phoenix Palace was not particularly strong right now, while the Nine Heavens Sacred Land enjoyed great prestige and even housed a miraculous master alchemist. No sect would refuse to seek relations with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—once such ties were forged, the benefits could be enormous; at the very least, the source of Saint Pills would be secure.

Chen Zhou had not expected that Saint Lord Yang would be so enthusiastic; the palace master found his heart stirred and his composure momentarily lost.

His face flushing with excitement, Chen Zhou hurriedly said, "I, Chen, thank Saint Lord Yang for his kindness; henceforth the Dragon-Phoenix Palace will stand with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land through thick and thin!"

He had weathered many storms before, yet Yang Kai's single sentence still moved him.

"No need for such courtesy. Since you're here, do us a favor," Yang Kai said, remembering one thing.

"Saint Lord, please speak," Chen Zhou replied, his face solemn.

"Palace Master Chen has seen for himself that my friends' cultivation levels are uneven, and the road to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land is extremely long—there could be unexpected dangers along the way. If it is convenient, could your palace provide an escort? Of course, once we reach the Sacred Land there will be generous reward," Yang Kai smiled.

The people of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace brightened at once.

Sun Yu hurriedly waved his hand. "Elder Yang, don't be so formal; tell us what you need and we'll see to it. Since we're already here, we'll accompany you. As for payment—don't mention it."

Chen Zhou collected himself and hastened to add, "Indeed, if Saint Lord shows such deference, it would be an insult to our Dragon-Phoenix Palace."

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "Then... I'll trouble you all."

Sun Yu laughed happily. "Excellent—I'll have another chance to learn by Elder Yang's side."

Under Chen Zhou's arrangements, the Dragon-Phoenix Palace members spread out to guard and keep watch.

They hadn't brought many people—only thirty or forty—but most were Transcendent Realm experts; with such reinforcements the route would be far safer. After all, they were familiar with the Tongxuan Continent and could handle problems easily, unlike the Great Han warriors, who knew nothing of this place.

Ling Jian quietly pulled Sun Yu aside and asked in a low voice, "Disciple, when did you meet that Saint Lord Yang? From the sound of it you've spent some time at his side—how did I not know?"

Sun Yu fumbled and stammered, daring not to tell the truth, which only deepened Ling Jian's suspicion.

Two days later, everything prepared, thousands of people swept off toward the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The warriors who had come from Great Han toured the surroundings with quick glances, perpetually curious—pointing, clustering in threes and fives, whispering among themselves.

The Dragon-Phoenix Palace members were instantly the popular attraction; every one of them was surrounded by countless martial artists asking about the Tongxuan Continent.

The palace experts dared not slight Yang Kai's friends; they answered every question, their moods oddly uneasy—left half amused, half exasperated by these rustic Great Han.

They discovered that for many of the basics, these people knew nothing at all.

Deeply moved, they wondered what kind of backwater the Small Xuan Realm must have been where those people had lived.

At the rear, Yang Kai walked side by side with Sun Yu; Sun Yu occasionally asked questions on martial cultivation, and Yang Kai taught him freely.

Not far off, Palace Master Chen Zhou watched the two striking figures ahead with a deep, thoughtful expression.

Sensing this, Yang Kai's interest stirred and he asked, "Palace Master Chen, did you discover something interesting?"

Chen Zhou smiled. "It's nothing major. I'm simply puzzled by the two young women ahead—they are almost identical. Not only in appearance and figure, but their life auras and True Yuan fluctuations are the same; the only difference lies in their temperament. If I hadn't known they only recently arrived on the Tongxuan Continent, I would have thought they came from that Sect.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and called out without preamble, "Jiao'er! Mei'er!"

The Hu sisters of the Hu family, walking not far ahead, halted at the call. When Yang Kai drew near, Hu Jiao'er asked, "What is it?"

Yang Kai ignored her question and instead looked at Chen Zhou. "Palace Master Chen, which sect do you think they're from?"

Chen Zhou was startled, then quickly replied, "Twin Pavilion—has Saint Lord Yang heard of them?"

Indeed.

Yang Kai nodded. "Of course I've heard of them, and I've heard that the Twin Pavilion and your palace have always maintained friendly relations."

"Yes. Our two families have long enjoyed close ties, and it's not without reason," Chen Zhou said with a wry smile, proceeding to recount the history.

The two families' friendship stretched back for generations.

As Yang Kai had suspected, both the Dragon-Phoenix Palace and the Twin Pavilion had once been extraordinarily powerful sects, their standing in human territories higher even than today's Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

For reasons unknown, a pair of top experts from the Twin Pavilion disappeared together with the Dragon Emperor and the Phoenix Empress; since then the two families lost access to the highest inheritances and gradually declined.

The two houses were bound by shared fate, and over the years their relationship grew ever closer.

"Our Dragon-Phoenix Palace fared somewhat better—Sun Yu has shown promise, unlocking the Dragon Emperor's inheritance and inheriting that legacy. Once he finds a suitable Phoenix Empress, our palace will surely reclaim its former glory. The Twin Pavilion, however... their inheritance has shown no sign of resurfacing," Chen Zhou sighed, both regretful and secretly relieved.

Sun Yu kept his head bowed and remained silent.

"The Twin Pavilion?" Hu Jiao'er reacted after a moment's thought, her expression growing excited. "What sort of sect is the Twin Pavilion?"

Chen Zhou chuckled. "A very unusual sect. They only recruit twins, so when their disciples venture out they always go in pairs. In that sense they're similar to our Dragon-Phoenix Palace, but we are a male-female dual cultivation house; theirs are twins born together, so the nature is different."

"They only recruit twins?" The Hu sisters' eyes brightened.

"Yes, and their disciples often resemble you two. After practicing their technique, twins' auras, True Yuan, and life fluctuations tend to align; when two work together their combined strike is devastating. Yet you two seem even stronger—I've visited the Twin Pavilion many times and seen many of their disciples, and on this point they do not measure up to you."

"Senior, do you know what technique they practice?" Hu Jiao'er asked urgently, her eyes full of eager expectation and a trace of nervousness.

Yang Kai glanced at her, sensing that she had her suspicions.

"Their technique appears to be called the Consonant Spirit Technique," Chen Zhou said casually, "but a large portion is missing. Although later generations patched it, they have never been able to restore the glory of their ancestors." He added that while a sect's method wouldn't be lightly taught, its name was not a secret.

"Consonant Spirit!" Hu Jiao'er trembled, her eyes shining all the more brightly.

"Sister..." Hu Mei'er covered her small mouth and murmured in disbelief, "Isn't that the technique we obtained?"

"You obtained it?" Chen Zhou cried out in astonishment, staring at the Hu sisters in shock.

Hu Jiao'er nodded solemnly. "The two of us practice the Consonant Spirit Technique—could it be related to the Twin Pavilion?"

"How could it be unrelated?" Chen Zhou grew excited. "It must be the Twin Pavilion's lost inheritance. I never expected you two to have obtained it—no wonder your auras are so perfectly alike!"

After speaking for a while, he suddenly burst into laughter. "If Wu Fa and Wu Tian were to learn of this, they'd be so excited they wouldn't sleep."

"Wu Fa and Wu Tian?" Yang Kai was startled.

"Oh—the Twin Pavilion's two pavilion masters are named Wu Fa and Wu Tian; they are a pair of twin brothers," Chen Zhou hastened to explain.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but chuckle in surprise. Wu Fa and Wu Tian—Lawless and Heavenless. Bold names, but reckless ones, certain to stir enmity. Cross the wrong temper, and they’d soon learn what it really meant to be lawless and heavenless.

"So that technique comes from the Twin Pavilion," Hu Jiao'er's expression grew complicated, her eyes distant.

Ever since she and her sister obtained the Consonant Spirit Technique, their lives had taken a different course. Their strength improved many times faster than ordinary people; in just over a decade they had risen to the Transcendent Realm and become among the few notable experts from Great Han.

They were deeply grateful for the technique and held great reverence for the predecessors who had left it behind.

Now that they knew the technique's origin and the sect behind it, the two sisters shared the same thought—to travel to the Twin Pavilion and see the sect from which their technique came, to look upon those twin brothers who cultivated the same art.
