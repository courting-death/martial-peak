## Chapter 996 — Seek Your Own Fortune

Staring at the middle-aged man whose face was twisted with fury and murderous intent, Shen Tu involuntarily drew his neck in and forced a wry smile. “We didn’t want to come back either.”

No fool would leave a prison only to return willingly; if Shen Tu weren’t compelled, he and Yang Kai would have long since fled with Wusuo.

“Master, don’t worry. I’m here—no one will dare harm you.” The middle-aged man looked toward Wusuo and said in a deep voice to reassure him.

“If you make any sudden move, I’ll kill him on the spot!” Yang Kai’s Saint Yuan and Divine Sense bristled, his cold gaze sweeping the surroundings.

“You dare, brat?!” The middle-aged man’s expression changed, clearly wary of provoking too much.

But Wusuo, who was still held aloft by Yang Kai, pressed a hand in the air and urged urgently, “Guichen, let old grievances go for now. It took me a lot of effort to persuade these two to bring me to the engine room. What matters most now is getting out of here as fast as we can.”

Hearing him, Lü Guichen’s expression turned grave. “The field outside seems to be changing. Master, what exactly is happening?”

“The field is about to erupt—quick, stabilize the warship and change course!” Wusuo barked orders, then turned to Yang Kai. “Kid, if you want to live, take me over to the star array.”

Yang Kai nodded and, following his directions, moved to a corner of the engine room.

Shen Tu followed closely behind, watching the surroundings with extreme vigilance.

The Purple Star cultivators sprang into action as well, each performing their duty under Lü Guichen’s command, beginning to take control of the warship.

On Yang Kai’s side, Wusuo was still firmly under his control.

A massive star array diagram lit up before Yang Kai. A three-dimensional, greatly miniaturized pattern of the starry void materialized—exquisite and awe-inspiring.

This was the enormous Star Chart stored within the warship, the same origin as the Star Chart kept in a Star Shuttle, though much more detailed and complex.

Wusuo sank his mind into it and began to busy himself within that miniaturized starry-void pattern.

He was the ship’s chart-master, responsible for guiding the warship’s course. In the shortest time he could find the safest, fastest escape route for the vessel.

Before long, a bright line lit up within that miniaturized starry-void image—Wusuo had traced a route whose origin was the warship’s current position and whose end marked where the ship should head.

Barring any unforeseen circumstance, the warship would follow that route and sail out of the Chaos Abyss.

After finishing, Wusuo let out a heavy breath and gave Lü Guichen a nod.

Lü Guichen understood at once. At his command, the warship sprang into action.

“Three at the Saint King Realm… the pressure is immense.” Shen Tu stood at Yang Kai’s side, silently observing Purple Star’s lineup.

Inside the engine room, besides Lü Guichen, another two Saint King Realm experts were present. Beyond them, numerous cultivators of the Saint Realm crowded in.

He and Yang Kai were like sheep among wolves, ringed by powerful enemies—one misstep would mean being torn to pieces. It helped that Wusuo’s status was considerable; otherwise Purple Star’s people would not have dared to act so cautiously.

“Any good plan?” Shen Tu asked Yang Kai.

“No. We’ll take it step by step—wait until we’re out of the Chaos Abyss before deciding.” Yang Kai shook his head.

Shen Tu sighed softly, feeling his luck had hit rock bottom. He had been aimlessly roaming the Chaos Abyss and gotten captured into this warship by chance; that would have been bad enough, but now to have to live on the knife-edge between life and death was sheer torment.

“How did these two get in?” Lü Guichen asked from the other side, his face sullen.

Liu Shan, standing beside him, pursed his lips. “The weaker one was brought back by Bi Ya.”

“Bi Ya?” Lü Guichen’s gaze cut through the crowd and landed on that seductive beauty. A glint of cold light flashed in his eyes and a frigid force burst through his mind.

In the crowd, Bi Ya wailed, clutching her head and screaming in agony, drenched in sweat and tormented. Her soaked clothes clung to her, leaving her exquisite figure exposed to everyone’s eyes.

No one dared to appreciate that sight. Every Purple Star cultivator held their breath in fear—when Lü Guichen was enraged he was terrifying.

“I’ll spare your life for now. When this crisis is over, I’ll settle accounts with you!” Lü Guichen snorted coldly.

Bi Ya trembled in terror, her delicate body shaking as she kowtowed. “Thank you, Lord, for sparing my life. I will atone for my crime!”

Saying that, her eyes flicked to Yang Kai with an ingrained hatred.

She had never taken this youth seriously, yet he had caused such trouble. Had she known this would happen, not even ten lives worth of courage would have allowed her to bring Yang Kai aboard—the moment she saw him in the Chaos Abyss she would have killed him.

She hated Yang Kai to the core, wishing she could flay him alive and let him taste every torment of the world.

“Lord, the Saint Crystal’s energy is insufficient.” Suddenly a cultivator hurriedly reported.

Lü Guichen’s cold gaze abruptly shifted to Yang Kai and Shen Tu.

Shen Tu shrugged indifferently. “I fired one Crystal Cannon shot—why are you looking at me? If you have time to glare, you’d better replace the Saint Crystals.”

Crystal Cannons required enormous energy. Ke Meng fired two shots before he died, and Shen Tu had fired once after that, almost draining the engine room’s Saint Crystal reserves.

Now the warship needed to flee the Chaos Abyss at full speed, and the remaining energy in the Saint Crystals was obviously insufficient.

“There’s no time to rearrange them.” Lü Guichen drew a deep breath and shouted, “All cultivators of Second Stage of the Saint Realm and above, come inside and provide power for the warship!”

Many cultivators wore bitter looks and reluctantly entered, but under Lü Guichen’s stare they had no choice but to sit in positions before Yang Kai and Shen Tu, grasp the shackles, and let them drain their power—using their Saint Yuan to substitute for the Saint Crystals’ energy.

In an instant, fifty or sixty Saint Realm cultivators trembled throughout their bodies, wracked with unbearable pain.

They stuffed pills into their mouths and clutched Saint Crystals in their hands to replenish their spent energy.

Shen Tu grinned, watching the Purple Star cultivators endure the torment he’d experienced earlier, looking thoroughly delighted.

With fifty or sixty people supplying power, the warship suddenly seemed to accelerate noticeably.

But the next moment, accompanied by a tremendous humming, the warship’s speed abruptly dropped. Moreover, as if some vast force were tugging at it from the depths, the ship could not move forward.

Under that force’s influence, the warship began to fall back, its backward motion gaining speed.

“It’s too late! It’s too late!” Wusuo turned ashen, his body shaking like a sieve as he muttered unconsciously, “This is the end.”

No sooner had he spoken than the entire warship seemed to lose control, careening toward a point in the starry sky. Everyone was thrown off their feet, tossed about chaotically inside the engine room.

“Look outside!” someone suddenly screamed.

All eyes turned to the viewports.

Yang Kai’s eyelids tightened as an uncontrollable chill rose from the depths of his heart.

Outside, those massive stars erupted with unimaginable energy; the energy was visible to the naked eye—thick, intense—rings of halo and ripples spreading from those great stars throughout the Chaos Abyss.

The fields produced by those stars burst, triggering a chain reaction of chaotic consequences.

At the very center of the Chaos Abyss, a vast black hole suddenly appeared, seeming capable of swallowing all things.

The Saint King-grade upper-level warship they occupied was hurtling straight toward that maw, the black hole’s gaping mouth ready to devour it.

A breath of death surged forth to meet them. Whether at the Transcendent Realm, the Saint Realm, or even the Saint King Realm, in that instant all felt their own insignificance.

Before that black hole, no one could guarantee they would walk away unscathed.

Lü Guichen screamed hoarsely, trying to command the Purple Star cultivators to steady the warship, but it was to no avail.

“So this is the Chaos Abyss’s true danger.” In the crisis, Shen Tu suddenly muttered beside Yang Kai, “No wonder no one knew—seeing this danger in person means you can only wait to die.”

“Wait to die?” Yang Kai glanced at him and snorted coldly. “I won’t sit and await death.”

“Heh, neither will I. Huh… isn’t that a Sword Alliance warship?” Shen Tu cried, pointing out the window.

Yang Kai looked and was momentarily speechless.

The Purple Star warship was being pulled toward the black hole, and the Sword Alliance vessel was no exception. That ship spun in a ridiculous manner as it flew toward them.

As it rotated, chunks of rigid hull kept shearing off and pouring into the black hole.

Yang Kai guessed their own warship was undergoing the same fate.

The two ships had originally tried to flee in different directions but none had succeeded; all were restrained.

At this rate, before being swallowed by the black hole the two warships would collide with each other.

Such a catastrophe would be utterly destructive.

“Brother, good luck—may you survive this.” Shen Tu said gravely, then sat cross-legged. In the next moment, electric currents surged over him, wrapping him in coils of electric energy until he resembled a silkworm chrysalis.

He had clearly sensed something amiss and sought to adopt his strongest defensive posture to endure the collision force and search for a sliver of hope.

Yang Kai paid him no heed and even let go of Wusuo, whom he had previously held.

At this critical moment, the Purple Star people were preoccupied with their own survival; the scene was chaotic and no one had time to bother him.

He watched the Sword Alliance warship barreling in from the side with a grave expression.

As the distance closed and the two warships were about to collide, Yang Kai’s Saint Yuan erupted.

He first unleashed the Saint-Grade upper-level Silver Leaf Secret Treasure, which transformed into a ribbon of a galaxy that wrapped his entire body, sealing him airtight. At the same time he deployed the Nine Heavens Divine Technique.

Faces of Vast Heaven Shields appeared, layering around him from all directions.
