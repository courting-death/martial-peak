## Chapter 1961 — Reentering the Bone Prison

The man at the head was an old fellow with a pale face and no beard; behind him stood several men and women with uneven cultivation—some at the Void King Realm and some at the Dao Origin Realm—and at that moment they all stared below in utter astonishment at the strange scene.

Upon seeing that old man, Zhou Yi was overjoyed and cried out, "Protector Miao, save me!"

"Protector Miao?" Yang Kai's expression shifted; he immediately understood who the newcomer was.

Miao Qi was also one of the Protectors of the Biyu Sect; his cultivation indeed reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, putting him on the same level as Bian Yuqing and Zhu Junshan.

An expert of that rank, should he desire Yang Kai's life, would likely leave Yang Kai with no means of resistance.

Yang Kai was not certain what attitude Miao Qi would take in handling today's matter; he secretly resolved that if Miao Qi intended to favor Zhou Yi and threaten his life, he would simply unleash the Yao Worm Matriarch and raise a ruckus.

Although the Yao Worm Matriarch could currently only manifest strength around the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, its foundation remained; if it fought desperately it would be enough to delay Miao Qi for a time.

He could then use that opportunity to flee together with Liu Qianyun.

Whether they could actually get away would depend on his methods.

With that in mind, Yang Kai calmed and met Miao Qi's gaze with resolute, unflinching composure.

Miao Qi seemed to be sizing Yang Kai up as well; the bizarre scene before him left him slightly startled—after all, the disparity between Yang Kai and Zhou Yi's cultivations was obvious, and by rights Yang Kai should have been the one subdued, yet it was Zhou Yi whose life was held in peril, and Miao Qi could not make sense of it.

As for Chu Fei and the others... their appearance and conduct were truly shameful.

"Protector Miao, save us!" Chu Fei and the others cried out one after another; Miao Qi's arrival gave them hope, and they no longer cared about Yang Kai's earlier threats, swelling their faces as they stood up from the ground to shout for rescue.

Miao Qi remained unmoved; his Divine Sense swept over Yang Kai repeatedly, as if trying to discern some secret.

A middle-aged warrior behind him stepped out, looking down on the crowd from above and asked coldly, "What is happening here?"

Chu Fei and the others clearly recognized the man; upon hearing him they hastened to cup their fists and said, "Humbly to Senior Brother Pang: previously we had some grievances with this Junior Brother Yang; today, hearing he had returned from Ice Cliff, we came specifically to offer apologies, but this Junior Brother Yang bore a grudge and, without listening to our explanation, suddenly leapt at us. We were outmatched and were humiliated for a while—please, Senior Brother Pang and Protector Miao, rule on our behalf."

Chu Fei was silver-tongued; in an instant he had fabricated a flawless account and slung the shit-bucket straight onto Yang Kai's head.

Yang Kai heard this and looked astonished, inwardly admiring Chu Fei's loquacity—he had never expected the fellow to be so glib.

Senior Brother Pang neither agreed nor denied, frowning as he asked, "Then what of Junior Brother Zhou's side of the matter?"

Chu Fei immediately filled with righteous indignation, pointing at Yang Kai and shouting, "Senior Brother Pang, judge for us: Senior Brother Zhou only happened to pass by, saw us being insulted and stepped forward to plead for us. Yet Junior Brother Yang feigned civility while secretly striking at Senior Brother Zhou—Senior Brother Zhou is kind-hearted. Who imagined this bastard would harbor such wolfish ambition; in a moment of carelessness... we implicated Senior Brother Zhou!"

Chu Fei wept as he spoke, assuming a look of remorse, while Zhou Yi said nothing yet played along with a sorrowful expression.

"You're lying!" Liu Qianyun, her pretty face flushed, could not stand it and bit back, "Clearly you bore grudges and, together with Senior Brother Zhou, came to pick a fight with Yang Kai; now you..."

"Qianyun, no need to explain," Yang Kai cut her off, sneering at Chu Fei as he said coolly, "Right and wrong—Protector Miao will judge for himself."

Liu Qianyun wanted to speak further, but seeing Yang Kai's steadfast gaze she sighed softly and fell silent.

Both she and Yang Kai knew that if Protector Miao stood with Chu Fei and Zhou Yi, even Chu Fei's flimsy fabrication would carry weight; if Protector Miao truly acted fairly, then no more explanation would be necessary.

Everything hinged on Miao Qi's attitude.

"No need to explain? I say you are guilty as thieves—now Senior Brother Zhou's life is in your hands and he could die at any moment; what explanation is there to give?" Chu Fei, changing from cowardly to impassioned, cried as if he had suffered the greatest wrong.

Yang Kai only sneered inwardly.

Senior Brother Pang frowned and, with disgust, said, "Shut up!"

Chu Fei hastily complied and dared not speak further.

Senior Brother Pang then turned to Yang Kai and said coolly, "You are the disciple who recently joined the sect?"

"Yes," Yang Kai replied, maintaining his previous posture with neither servility nor arrogance, "Yang Kai pays respects to Senior Brothers and Protector Miao; forgive me for being unable to perform the salutation properly just now—pardon any offense."

Senior Brother Pang sneered, "I've heard of you: bold fellow. Shortly after entering you caused quite a stir—you supposedly beat Yan Xiuran, even bit a Treasure-Stealing Serpent to death. The last time you erred, Protector Bian confined you; you've only just been released and are already acting up again?"

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and coldly said, "The tree wishes stillness, but the wind will not cease."

"Arrogant!" Senior Brother Pang snorted. "A mere newly joined disciple who disregards sect rules and provokes trouble everywhere—you are clearly no good!"

Yang Kai's expression turned cold and he said solemnly, "Senior Brother Pang, to judge without knowing the full circumstances is unfair, is it not?"

"I admonish you for your own good—how dare you answer back?" Senior Brother Pang's anger flared; his Origin Qi rippled as if he truly intended to teach Yang Kai a lesson.

Yang Kai's heart sank; if Senior Brother Pang's attitude represented Protector Miao's stance, then today he might be unable to escape his fate.

Just as he prepared to unleash the Yao Worm Matriarch and make a scene, Protector Miao lightly waved his hand.

Senior Brother Pang's fury ebbed as he lowered his head, restrained the fluctuations of his Origin Qi, and meekly stepped back.

Miao Qi's gaze swept over Yang Kai before settling on Zhou Yi; he snorted coldly, "Mediocre!"

Hearing that, Zhou Yi's face went pale.

He naturally heard in Miao Qi's words a clear expression of dissatisfaction toward him; after all, being so thoroughly suppressed by Yang Kai left him no defense.

To be subdued like that by a Third Stage Void King Realm Junior Brother, the label "mediocre" was hardly unfair.

Zhou Yi realized he would likely never again win the sect's trust; his heart chilled into despair, and an overwhelming, burning hatred for Yang Kai filled him.

If not for Yang Kai, why would Miao Qi speak so of him? He bowed his head and clenched his teeth in silence, while his eyes flashed with bitter malice.

At that moment, Miao Qi swept a cool look at Yang Kai and said in a low, grave voice, "This old man cares not why fellow disciples turned on one another today, but since I chanced upon the scene I cannot let it pass. Bind them all and cast them into the Bone Prison — wait for Protector Bian to return before making any further disposition."

Having spoken, Miao Qi turned and left.

Senior Brother Pang bowed and escorted him respectfully.

After Miao Qi departed, Senior Brother Pang stood for a moment and then said, "You heard Protector Miao—obey his orders!"

Chu Fei and the others looked crestfallen, like roosters who had lost a fight, utterly dispirited; they had not expected Protector Miao to handle the matter in such a way.

Yang Kai's expression brightened; as long as Miao Qi did not act directly against him, everything could be managed.

Such a disposition was precisely what Yang Kai most wanted to see.

Grinning, he said, "Senior Brother Pang, it's not that I refuse to obey—but you saw the look in Senior Brother Zhou's eyes; if I loosen my grip and he bites me... hehe, this Junior Brother's strength is limited and could not withstand it."

"You are meddlesome!" Senior Brother Pang snorted coldly, standing with arrogant posture and saying, "Rest assured: since Protector Miao has spoken, Zhou Yi will not act recklessly. Release him."

"If Senior Brother Pang says so, then this Junior Brother will comply." Yang Kai cheerfully withdrew the Golden Blood Threads binding Zhou Yi and pulled his hand out from Zhou Yi's chest, producing a spray of blood that made one look away.

Secretly, however, he had urged an internal burst of force within Zhou Yi, quietly dealing him a hidden blow.

Zhou Yi could not help but groan and spat a mouthful of blood, glaring at Yang Kai through clenched teeth: "You..."

"Sorry, was my move a bit too violent? Want me to put it back and try again?" Yang Kai asked with an innocent look.

Zhou Yi ground his teeth and said coldly, "You pray you never fall into my hands—if you do, I will make your life worse than death!"

"Senior Brother Pang, he threatened me!" Yang Kai immediately cried out with feigned alarm.

Senior Brother Pang paid him no mind, displeasure writ large on his face; he formed hand seals and his fingers flicked, unleashing arrays of restraining formations at those present, and even Liu Qianyun was not spared.

The six people involved in the incident had their cultivations sealed in a remarkably short time.

"Follow me!" Senior Brother Pang, plainly impatient, waved and wrapped them all in his Origin Qi, flying off in the direction of the Bone Prison.

At the Bone Prison's entrance, Yan Xiuran still stood posted; upon seeing Senior Brother Pang's arrival he immediately greeted him obsequiously.

Senior Brother Pang nodded, "Take these troublemakers inside and keep a strict watch."

"Yes." Yan Xiuran answered, then his eyes bulged as he pointed at Yang Kai with the glare of a sworn enemy: "You... you bastard!"

"Hehe, Senior Brother Yan, good to see you again," Yang Kai greeted him with a beaming smile.

Yan Xiuran's face turned cold: "Very well—didn't expect you'd have another turn at the Bone Prison. Senior Brother will be sure to entertain you properly."

“Then I’ll trouble Senior Brother to put in the extra effort,” Yang Kai said with an air of utter fearlessness, leaving Senior Brother Pang shaking his head despite himself.
