## Chapter 545 — Who Do You Think You Are?

None of them knew exactly what had happened. When they arrived outside the manor and looked ahead under the moonlight, they were all dumbfounded.

Not far from the mansion’s entrance, Qiu Yimeng stood there alone.

About twenty zhang behind her, over twenty Divine Roaming Realm experts belonging to the Qiu Family were lined up in formation, their combined pressure terrifying beyond measure.

After a brief moment of shock, Luo Xiaoman called out joyfully, “Sister Qiu!”

She rushed out from the crowd toward Qiu Yimeng, her large jade peaks rising and falling magnificently.

Among everyone, the closest relationship was between her and Qiu Yimeng. One was shrewd and capable, the other somewhat muddled and charmingly naive; their personalities were complementary. Thus, Qiu Yimeng treated her very well, and their bond was inseparable.

This morning, when Qiu Yimeng left, Luo Xiaoman had cried for a long time, her eyes still red and spirit unsettled.

Seeing Qiu Yimeng return now, Luo Xiaoman was happier than anyone, her beautiful eyes shining with joy as if a lost child had found her way home. She hurried forward.

Yet on Qiu Yimeng’s face lingered a faint sadness, her expression cold and indifferent.

When they were about five zhang apart, Qiu Yimeng gently raised her fair hand.

A streak of light shot out like a whip from her palm, striking the ground before Luo Xiaoman’s feet.

Dust flew up.

Luo Xiaoman halted, staring foolishly at Qiu Yimeng.

“Don’t come any closer, or don’t blame me for being merciless,” Qiu Yimeng said coldly, her gaze icy and distant.

“Sister Qiu...” Luo Xiaoman murmured, eyes full of confusion, not yet understanding what had just happened.

Qiu Yimeng had never laid a hand on her before, but that strike—had Luo Xiaoman been just a little faster, or had Qiu Yimeng aimed farther—could have crippled her legs outright.

Feeling Qiu Yimeng’s coldness and rejection, a crushing pain welled up in Luo Xiaoman’s heart, tears of bitterness spilling from her mouth as a creeping fear took hold.

Before she could react, a large hand rested on her delicate shoulder. Turning, she saw Yang Kai slowly shaking his head.

“Go back,” Yang Kai ordered lightly. Without waiting for her response, he casually tossed her backward.

When Luo Xiaoman landed, she sensed the atmosphere had changed.

Outside the mansion, Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng faced each other silently, much like when Miss Qiu had left this morning. They exchanged no words; everything was conveyed in silence.

But anyone could see the difference between this meeting and the parting earlier.

“Were you forced?” Yang Kai asked, tilting his head, his expression serious as he looked at Qiu Yimeng.

“No,” Qiu Yimeng shook her head gently.

“No?” Yang Kai smiled, the corners of his mouth lifting. “If you weren’t forced, why bring these people here? You’re not here to pledge allegiance to me, are you?”

“You know why I’m here. There’s no need to ask so many questions,” Qiu Yimeng’s face remained cold.

“If you don’t say, how am I supposed to know?”

“You’re the same—never telling me anything. Why should I bother telling you?” Qiu Yimeng shot back.

Yang Kai shrugged helplessly.

“Miss Qiu, no need to waste words on him,” a clear voice suddenly called out from behind Qiu Yimeng.

At once, the Divine Roaming Realm experts, previously about twenty zhang behind Qiu Yimeng, stepped forward with imposing momentum and positioned themselves near her.

“Who are you?” Yang Kai frowned.

“I am Chen Xuan, the Elder of the Qiu Family’s Falling Leaf Hall!” the man snorted coldly, raising his head proudly. “Miss Qiu has kindly come to speak with you, and the time for words has ended.”

Yang Kai’s expression did not change; he nodded slightly. “I’ve heard of you. The name of the Falling Leaf Hall’s leader does indeed thunder throughout the land.”

The Falling Leaf Hall of the Qiu Family was equivalent to the Blood Servants Hall of the Yang Family. Each of the Eight Great Families possessed such an organization, whose cultivators were utterly loyal to their clan.

However, due to differing lineages, prestige, and training methods, the Blood Servants Hall was the most renowned among the Eight Great Families. Its experts were one grade stronger than those from the other seven families.

Especially the forbidden martial skill, the Blood Fury Technique, exclusive to the Blood Servants Hall, gave this institution a dominant edge over all others.

The Qiu Family’s Falling Leaf Hall was just such an organization, known for its ruthless efficiency—acting like autumn winds sweeping fallen leaves. Their attacks never gave enemies a moment’s respite.

Because of this principle, members of the Falling Leaf Hall were generally hot-headed and despised wasted time.

Thus, judging by their impatience during the brief exchange between Qiu Yimeng and Yang Kai, their characters revealed themselves clearly.

Chen Xuan snorted disdainfully, ignoring Yang Kai’s compliments, and sneered, “Since the talk is done, Miss Qiu, please step back.” Then he turned coldly to Yang Kai. “Boy, your days are numbered. Though you are a scion of the Yang Family, you practice forbidden arts, consort with demons and devils, and seek to overthrow the Eight Great Families. Today is your end.”

Chen Xuan and the Falling Leaf Hall experts had all stayed in Zhongdu and thus had a limited understanding of Yang Kai and the forces at his disposal. Though they tracked the Succession War and had heard some rumors of Yang Kai’s prowess, Chen Xuan considered these reports heavily exaggerated, mere hearsay.

As a peak Divine Roaming Realm master, how could he take someone only at the Second Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm seriously, especially someone so young?

Not only Chen Xuan but most other experts from the Seven Great Families shared this view. They felt the alliance of the Seven Great Families was overreacting by deploying so many strong fighters.

Therefore, when Qiu Yimeng led them here tonight to provoke trouble for Yang Kai’s mansion, Chen Xuan and his men were elated, confident they could easily breach Yang Kai’s defenses.

Even Ling Taixu, who was guarding the mansion, was not taken seriously by them.

Though Ling Taixu was beyond the Divine Roaming Realm and master of the Evil Sect, teacher of the Evil Lord, they believed he wouldn’t dare make a move lightly, as the Eight in Fengshen Hall surely would not stand idly by.

When Chen Xuan spoke so arrogantly, Yang Kai’s expression turned cold. “Big talk.”

“Chen Hallmaster, please wait a moment,” Qiu Yimeng suddenly interrupted. “I have a few more words to say to Yang Kai.”

Chen Xuan snorted but didn’t want to embarrass Qiu Yimeng. Before coming, Qiu Shoucheng had reminded them that, although this mission rode on the stage of the Succession War and bore the name of the Eight Great Families’ scions, the real decision-maker on the battlefield was Chen Xuan.

In other words, Qiu Yimeng had to heed Chen Xuan’s authority—for now.

But a few words was something Chen Xuan could tolerate.

Yang Kai glanced at him coldly and then turned to Qiu Yimeng, quietly asking, “What exactly is this about?”

“My father said that as long as you were defeated and captured, I could inherit the Qiu Family’s legacy as a daughter. You know how much I long for that day. Though we got along well before, compared with my lifelong ambition, who do you think you are?” she said.

“Heh,” Yang Kai laughed. “I may not be much, but can you really fool yourself with such nonsense?”

“When have I ever spoken nonsense? I’m telling the truth. I came today to defeat you. Yang Kai, for the sake of all these days I have assisted you, how about you just surrender? If we truly fight, it would hurt everyone’s feelings—and besides, I’m definitely not your match.”

“Fine,” Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Chen Xuan’s eyes brightened but he quickly grew wary, watching Yang Kai closely for any trickery.

Yang Kai’s people were stunned.

They hadn’t expected that after just one day, Qiu Yimeng would so readily take a stance opposing Yang Kai, even leading others to cause trouble for him. Seeing her so calm and indifferent, many grew righteously enraged but, out of respect for past relations, refrained from open insults.

Had it been someone else, they would have lost all patience, likely hurling every curse imaginable at her ancestors.

Still, their expressions soured; Luo Xiaoman’s eyes welled with tears as she stared at Qiu Yimeng in disbelief.

“Are you truly willing?” Qiu Yimeng was momentarily stunned.

“Why not? Capture me, and you become head of the Qiu Family, right?” Yang Kai chuckled. “You’ve given so much for me; it’s only fair I return a little favor.”

Qiu Yimeng’s expression shifted, a strange light flickering in her beautiful eyes, as though touched to tears by those words.

“Miss Qiu...” Chen Xuan hurriedly urged, impatient at Qiu Yimeng’s apparent reluctance to act.

If they could capture Yang Kai without bloodshed, the Qiu Family would earn great merit. Qiu Shoucheng had said that once Yang Kai was captured, no cost should be spared to send him back to the Qiu Family in Zhongdu!

Qiu Yimeng ignored him, still moved, then suddenly tightened her teeth and growled, “Do you think those words will soften my heart and stop me from attacking? You really are despicable.”

Yang Kai grinned, revealing a set of gleaming white teeth, as if embarrassed to be seen through.

“So that’s what you think,” Qiu Yimeng fumed, bitterly regretting having felt touched moments ago. Her voice became sharp: “No matter what you think, since I’m here, I won’t leave empty-handed.”

With that, she suddenly raised her hand, and a dagger about a chi long appeared, shimmering with silver light—clearly a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure.

True Yuan surged forth fiercely, ruthless.

A shout of shock rang out. No one expected the sudden change, not even Ying Jiu managed to react in time.

Chen Xuan and the Falling Leaf Hall’s experts’ eyes lit up as they held their breath, secretly hopeful.
