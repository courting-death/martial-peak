## Chapter 786 — Enlightenment

Masters' exchanges test not only their techniques but also their state of mind and their will.

Di Xiao staggered, and the deadlock cleared in an instant; his momentum collapsed like a breached dam, and Yang Kai utterly dominated him.

The demon spectators in the stands finally sensed danger; originally the black and golden energies had been evenly matched in the Death Arena, neither yielding to the other, but suddenly the pitch-black demonic aura belonging to Di Xiao weakened considerably, while that irritating golden hue flared intensely.

Seeing this, nobody could sit still.

"No way! That kid beat Di Xiao?"

"Impossible—Di Xiao is a Third Stage Transcendent; he's two minor stages above him."

"If Di Xiao loses, our demon race's face is gone!"

"Is he even human? A First Stage Transcendent taking down a Third Stage—if he really reaches the Saint Realm, what will happen then?"

Even Feng Biao, sent by Gou Qiong, looked sullen; displeasure carved his brows, and his eagle-claw-sized hand crushed his chair's back into powder without even noticing.

Xueli leaned forward, her Divine Sense probing into the Death Arena, watching the battle's every shift.

None of those present could see as clearly as she could—after all, she'd personally set the arena's barrier and wards, intended only to give the combatants space to fight without disturbing the gamblers in the stands; the methods were those of top experts, so others trying to peer through the barrier could only see a blur.

Xueli was different; her beautiful eyes seemed to hover over Yang Kai and Di Xiao, fixed with absolute focus.

This fight had turned out beyond her expectation; if she hadn't earlier inferred from An Ling'er's emotions and the clues that Yang Kai might win, Xueli would have scarcely believed it.

And the battle was even more spectacular than she'd predicted!

Moreover, as she watched, the murderous intent Xueli had held toward Yang Kai faded away, replaced by thick puzzlement.

Amid the dense detonations, the once-entangled black and gold energies abruptly separated. Two figures staggered backward, coming to a halting stand dozens of zhang apart.

Dust rose, the battlefield in chaos; everyone in the stands held their breath, utterly silent, eyes fixed below, eager to see who had the edge.

Slowly, the dust settled, and the two down below came into view.

A chorus of sharp intakes echoed; no one could believe what they were seeing.

Di Xiao was bathed in blood—there was scarcely an uninjured patch on him; his flesh bore clear palm prints: fist marks, finger marks...

This elite under Gou Qiong looked exhausted, gasping like a broken bellows, his remaining strength nearly spent.

Yang Kai was likewise drenched in blood, and in the sunlight a faint golden luster even seemed to halo him, making him look bizarrely otherworldly. His sturdy body was riddled with wounds, not much better than Di Xiao's.

The only difference lay in their eyes: Di Xiao's once-dazzling gaze was now dim and lifeless, while Yang Kai's shone with vigor.

Di Xiao had lost!

Anyone who wasn't blind could tell.

"I underestimated you... you're really strong!" Di Xiao coughed painfully, spitting out clots of blood and fragments of internal organs.

"Anyone who underestimates me will pay!" Yang Kai grinned, took a deep breath, then lifted a foot and strode forward; True Yuan surged wildly through him, his eyes full of killing intent.

He intended to kill the man before him and end this deathmatch.

Seeing his intention, Feng Biao—whose face had been thunderous in the stands—couldn't sit still; he leapt to his feet and roared, "You dare, boy?!"

In the next instant he vanished like lightning, becoming a streak of light as he charged into the Death Arena.

Although Di Xiao had disappointed Lord Gou Qiong by losing to a human boy, he was still a favored retainer; Yang Kai had no right to move in and slay him outright.

Feng Biao could not stand idly by; he planned to take advantage of the moment to eliminate Yang Kai too.

"Yu Mo!" Xueli suddenly called in a low voice.

Yu Mo nodded slightly and vanished as well.

Moments later he appeared before Feng Biao, blocking his path.

"Stand aside!" Feng Biao flew into a rage, paying no heed to the fact this was Xueli's territory, and struck at Yu Mo; the latter snorted and deflected the blow.

Two Saint Realm demon experts clashed in an instant, and the sky above the Death Arena flickered with terrifying bursts of light as their power exploded.

All the demons in the stands were dumbfounded; they hadn't expected not only a spectacular Transcendent-level duel but also to witness Saint Realm combat—and they were electrified, watching with rapt attention.

"Yu Mo, what are you doing!" Feng Biao snarled as he found himself unable to break free. "Do you know who Di Xiao serves? If he dies here, can you bear Lord Gou Qiong's wrath?"

"Idiot! Whether Gou Qiong is angry is none of my concern!" Yu Mo sneered. "This is Sand City—my lord's domain. Have you forgotten where you are?"

"You're forcing Lord Gou Qiong and Lord Xueli to go to war!"

"That's not my aim. The Death Arena has rules: only one person walks out alive. That rule cannot be broken!"

"You..." Feng Biao's eyes twisted with rage as he grappled with Yu Mo; by then Yang Kai had already reached Di Xiao, True Yuan churning at his fingertips, his movements steady beyond measure.

Exhausted Di Xiao could barely stand, let alone resist; he looked skyward with pleading eyes.

Feng Biao shouted, "Boy, if you dare move you'll be dead!"

No sooner had he spoken than the True Yuan at Yang Kai's fingertips formed into a sharp sword and drove into Di Xiao's chest.

Di Xiao's body trembled; blood spurted from his chest like a fountain, his eyes widening as he fell flat on his back.

Thud...

A ring of dust kicked up.

"Damn this kid..."

"He really killed Di Xiao."

"This just got interesting—I doubt even Lord Xueli can save him now!"

"Lord Xueli wasn't going to save him anyway; he's dead for sure!"

In midair, witnessing Di Xiao's death, Feng Biao and Yu Mo both ceased fighting; the former's face darkened like an approaching storm, his red eyes fixed on Yang Kai as if he wanted to rip the mask off his face and see what he was made of.

Yu Mo's eyelids twitched; secretly he was startled by Yang Kai's audacity, and without a word returned to Xueli's side.

Yang Kai stood motionless beside Di Xiao's corpse, his back straight as a rod.

Unnoticed, a strand of soul-energy drew in through the tug of the World-Ending Demon Eye and entered Yang Kai's mind, where he purified and absorbed it.

Gradually the air itself felt strange; the qi around Yang Kai pulsed erratically.

Feng Biao's eyes narrowed as he stared at Yang Kai, and a flash of horror and apprehension crossed his gaze.

"Lord..." Yu Mo also cried out, his gaze locked on Yang Kai.

Xueli was moved again, sensing the disorder in Yang Kai's energies; seeing the light that flickered about him, she froze.

"Lord, could it be..." Yu Mo murmured in astonishment.

"Yes—enlightenment. This kid..." Xueli's eyes brightened strangely. "Perhaps all these life-or-death battles over recent months have taught him much, and today's fight has fully elevated those insights."

"Incredible!" Yu Mo exclaimed. "He chose to breakthrough here? How arrogant!"

Di Xiao had been slain by him only moments ago, and Feng Biao wanted nothing more than to immediately kill him; the demons in the stands were furious, clamoring for Yang Kai's blood—this was no time to breakthrough.

It could trigger a riot; an incensed crowd could overwhelm and consume him.

"Lord, shall we stand by?" Yu Mo asked, eyes flicking.

If Xueli didn't intervene, Yang Kai would be certain to die today; no demon wished to see a human grow stronger. Although Yang Kai had brought entertainment to Sand City before, the situation had changed.

Nearly everyone now realized his terrifying potential!

"Intervene. Of course intervene. Issue the order: anyone who dares enter the Death Arena before he finishes his breakthrough is to be slain without mercy!" Xueli's lovely face shone with an inexplicable excitement.

"Huh?" Yu Mo was stunned, utterly bewildered.

Earlier Xueli had plainly wanted Yang Kai dead, and after today's fight he still should have been certain to die; yet her sudden attitude left Yu Mo baffled.

If they truly wanted to kill the human boy, they didn't need to step in—Feng Biao and the other demons could have finished him during the breakthrough.

The prior restraint against Feng Biao had been to curb Gou Qiong's arrogance and to uphold the Death Arena's rules.

Could it be that the boy performed so well that Lord Xueli was reluctant to kill him? Yu Mo puzzled inwardly, unable to figure it out.

He asked no more and quickly spread the mental command.

At the next moment many demon experts rushed out to the arena's perimeter, forming an iron-clad cordon around the Death Arena.

Seeing this, everyone understood Xueli was protecting Yang Kai; they dared not act rashly, though curses still flew.

Yang Kai, standing in the center of the Death Arena, seemed oblivious to it all.

In truth he was watching closely; Xueli's subordinates' movements felt strange, but since the woman did not intend to kill him for now, Yang Kai could safely and boldly break through without worry. With that thought his spirit calmed—no sorrow, no joy, no desire, no thought—as his qi surged within him.
