## Chapter 547 — This Is No Longer a Succession War

He was calling for reinforcements.

If no one intervened soon, he would have no choice but to retreat with his men. Continuing the fight now risked the entire Falling Leaf Hall being wiped out here.

The cultivation and skills of those from Yang Kai’s residence far exceeded his expectations.

These Divine Roaming Realm warriors not only possessed pure True Yuan but also wielded formidable techniques. Their Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures were dazzlingly abundant.

Could these Divine Roaming Realm fighters really be from a top-tier aristocratic family? Why did it feel like they were even wealthier than people like himself? Chen Xuan felt gloomy.

Falling Leaf Hall was one of the key branches of the Qiu Family. The strong warriors inside were loyal, and the Secret Treasures they were equipped with were naturally not few or poor. It could even be said they were the best and most numerous within the entire Qiu Family. Yet, compared to those from Yang Kai’s residence, they still looked somewhat shabby.

Moreover, the pills they used during battle were strange. Chen Xuan and the other Falling Leaf Hall experts were all panting heavily, their True Yuan failing them. Yet, the opponents remained as vigorous and unrestrained as ever, flinging True Yuan without any concern for overexertion.

What kind of pill had such a powerful restorative effect?

Although Chen Xuan had long known that Yang Kai’s residence had the backing of the two great supports, Yao Wang Valley and Baoqi Sect, only now did he deeply realize how formidable their assistance truly was.

At the sound of his calls, Ye Xinrou from a mile away could no longer sit idle.

The Qiu Family’s Falling Leaf Hall had suffered heavy losses, all visible to her, and she snorted coldly, “A bunch of useless fools.”

Then she adopted a leisurely, lazy posture as if preparing for something she really didn’t want to do.

Gao Rangfeng and Kang Zhan, seeing her behavior and the suffering of the Qiu Family’s Falling Leaf Hall, couldn’t help but feel a kinship in their sorrow.

The mile-long distance was quickly covered.

Before she arrived, Ye Xinrou’s sharp cry echoed throughout the War City: “Yang Kai, you consort with demons and evildoers and will sooner or later fall into the path of evil. Do not be stubborn and weave your own cocoon of doom. Surrender your Evil Sect disciples within your residence and submit yourself to justice! For the sake of the Eight Great Families’ long-standing relations here in Zhongdu, we will show leniency. If you keep resisting, you will only doom those innocent people around you.”

Amidst the fierce battle, Yang Kai’s figure flickered as he leapt out of the fighting zone and hovered calmly midair. His expression was indifferent as he fixed his gaze over there.

Leading the charge were the sons and daughters of the six great super families, each backed by a number of experts comparable in level and quantity to the Falling Leaf Hall’s strongest.

As these people locked eyes with Yang Kai, except for Ye Xinrou’s smug expression, the others displayed varying degrees of shame. Huo Xingchen sneered ambiguously, “Miss Ye, quite the eloquence.”

Her speech had immediately placed Yang Kai on the ethical defensive. Huo Xingchen admitted he himself could not have come up with such words.

It seemed Ye Xinrou had gone to great lengths to figure out how to put Yang Kai at a disadvantage.

“Miss Ye,” Yang Kai suddenly grinned after a moment of silence. “Few days have passed, and you’ve grown quite arrogant. Where is my second brother?”

A trace of malice flickered in Ye Xinrou’s eyes. Last time, having failed to seduce Yang Kai and instead being called a worn-out whore by him, she naturally held a grudge. But she showed no hint of it, only a faint smile. “The Second Young Master is in seclusion. I am now in charge of all affairs at the residence.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, his expression significantly better. “I always suspected my second brother wouldn’t be so despicably shameless. It turns out someone else is directing this operation. No wonder.”

Ye Xinrou’s face darkened, cursing silently.

Yang Kai continued smiling, a strange look surfacing on his face. In a teasing tone, he said, “Miss Ye, about the other day, I must apologize. After careful thought, the fault was mine. You came knocking, and I shouldn’t have turned you away. You’re so beautiful and delicate—even if I had stripped you and we embraced intimately, I wouldn’t have lost anything; in fact, I would have gained. I don’t know why my mind froze then and I missed the chance. I truly regret it!” As he spoke, he slapped his thigh vigorously, his regret obvious.

Hearing this, Kang Zhan, Gao Rangfeng, and the others exchanged awkward glances, all turning their heads toward Ye Xinrou.

None of them knew that Ye Xinrou had ever tried to seduce Yang Kai, and judging by the situation, it seemed she had gone hoping for success but returned disappointed...

This... was truly a ridiculous farce.

Such boldness from the young master drew their admiration. They thought if Ye Xinrou tried to seduce them, they might well fall instantly.

“I’ve come to understand now,” Yang Kai said seriously. “Miss Ye, why don’t we find a quiet place now so I can properly satisfy you? I am strong, and my skills in bed are not bad either.”

Ye Xinrou’s expression turned awkward; her fragrant shoulders trembled with anger. She had never imagined Yang Kai would be so shameless, airing such private matters openly.

She wanted to retort but felt helpless, and anger broke out: “Yang Kai, don’t slander me with filthy words and impudence. How could I possibly be such a person?”

Gao Rangfeng and Kang Zhan turned their heads, expressions strange.

Huo Xingchen whistled lightly and mockingly.

“You don’t believe me?” Ye Xinrou glared fiercely at them, her pretty face flushing red.

No one answered.

“Believe it or not, nothing happened between me and that bastard.” She gasped heavily, clearly enraged.

“That’s right. Young Master Kai shut you out; what could you possibly do with him?” Huo Xingchen sneered sarcastically.

Ye Xinrou took a deep breath. When she exhaled, the anger was gone. Looking at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes radiated a cold chill, a blade-like smirk curling at her lips. She nodded lightly: “Yang Kai, I did not come here to argue with you but to take you back to Zhongdu to cleanse your evil aura and sins. This is the will of the Eight Great Families!”

With a pointed finger, she commanded, “Capture Yang Kai! Anyone who dares resist will be killed!”

She was furious and ashamed, unwilling to continue verbal sparring with Yang Kai.

Behind her, six groups of people responded immediately, their momentum overwhelming.

“Do you take me for nothing?” Yang Kai roared. “Tu Feng!”

Seven figures suddenly burst out from within the residence, led by Tu Feng, along with the other seven Blood Servants.

Counting Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian, nine Blood Servants from the residence had fully mobilized.

“Blood Fury Technique!” They roared in unison, their ferocious Qi and blood power causing everyone’s pupils to tremble. At that moment, the entire War City seemed to crack as if heaven and earth were collapsing.

A mixture of fear and excitement appeared on Ye Xinrou’s face as she shouted, “Yang Kai, do not forget: this is a Succession War. You made a pact with the Yang Family. Tu Feng and his people are forbidden from interfering in the Succession War. If you let them fight, it will be a breach of your agreement with the family.”

“This is no longer a Succession War,” Yang Kai sneered coldly. “You understand that better than I do!”

Amid his fierce clash with the Falling Leaf Hall experts, Di Mo let out a sinister chuckle and murmured, “Do you really think the Young Master gives a damn about the Succession War? The Yang Family’s head isn’t worth shit. If not for being tied down here, he would’ve left long ago.”

“What did you say?” A Falling Leaf Hall expert fighting Di Mo asked warily, puzzled by his muttering.

Di Mo grinned, revealing a row of sharp fangs. “I said, you will die!”

Those words carried a dark power that invaded the expert’s mind. The next moment, his movements froze. His eyes went vacant and his face turned deathly pale. He murmured, “I’m dead... I’m... dead...”

“Idiot.” Di Mo scoffed coldly. Seizing the moment when his opponent’s spirit faltered, he plunged a hand into the man’s chest and drew out a still-beating heart.

Blood sprayed like a tide from the man’s chest.

Di Mo’s face grew even more hideous and terrifying. He glanced toward the thickest cluster of enemies and bellowed, “Blood Sea Sealing Heaven!”

A beam of blood light shot from his back as the land instantly turned viscous, as if soaked in blood. A sinister aura spread throughout, and everyone trapped in the bloody swamp found their movements sluggish.

Ye Xinrou’s expression became horrified. Gao Rangfeng, Kang Zhan, and Meng Shanyi were all moved. Even Liu Qingyao’s face revealed a deep apprehension.

Before this, no one had ever understood—let alone accepted—Di Mo’s cruelty. They had never imagined that such a vile and sinister Martial Skill could exist in this world.

The thick, almost tangible stench of blood made Ye Xinrou nearly vomit.

Di Mo’s brutal strike instantly confined more than a dozen Divine Roaming Realm warriors in a blood sea, trapping them utterly.

“How is this possible!” After watching for a while, Gao Rangfeng shouted in shock.

He had realized that the allied forces of the seven great super families, who had gathered over a hundred Divine Roaming Realm experts above Sixth Stage, still could not swiftly crush those from Yang Kai’s residence.

Although vastly outnumbered, Yang Kai’s Divine Roaming Realm warriors managed to hold their own with vigor.

Looking more closely, Gao Rangfeng suddenly woke up to a shocking fact: “When did all those Blood Servants become Divine Roaming Realm Ninth Stage?”

This revelation stunned the others as well.

Nine Blood Servants, all at Divine Roaming Realm Ninth Stage...

A few days ago when Yang Kai advanced to Divine Roaming Realm, four of those guards had still been at Eighth Stage. Only ten days had passed, yet they had all broken through.

A Blood Servant at Divine Roaming Realm Ninth Stage who wields Blood Fury Technique could trade blows with those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. Although the seven great families’ experts were formidable, even combined they were no match for them.

It could be said the reason Yang Kai’s residence had held out so well was almost entirely due to the efforts of these nine Blood Servants.

“They still have one top Divine Roaming Realm expert who hasn't entered the battle!” Liu Qingyao said suddenly and calmly, causing everyone’s hearts to tighten.
