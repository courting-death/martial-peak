## Chapter 1328 — Is your surname Xie?

The old man's cultivation only reached the peak of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; if he weren't weighed down by countless concerns, he would have dealt with Yu Feng swiftly—killed him outright and used the soul-probing secret technique to seize whatever information lay within Yu Feng's mind.

But for various reasons the old man still dared not kill casually. Moreover, the soul-probing secret technique consumes tremendous energy and might not yield the intelligence he wanted, so he couldn't act directly and could only coerce Yu Feng and the others by these means.

Seeing Yu Feng stand so stubborn, the hulking man sneered again and again: "Fine, fine, I like people with backbone. You can hold out and keep silent—what about the rest of you? Let's see if you all are equally tough."

He said this, then glanced at the second man and asked the same question as before.

The answer he received was yet another mouthful of spit laced with blood.

The hulking man lashed out with his long whip once more, sending the Haike Family disciple flying in circles before he crashed heavily to the ground and lay there for a long while without rising.

Then he turned his gaze to the third man; his face darkened to an extreme as he barked: "Speak. Say it and you might be spared; otherwise you'll pay for it."

The third Haike Family disciple lifted his eyelids and looked at him with a cold expression. This disciple only possessed the strength of the First Stage of the Saint Realm, the weakest among them. With his Saint Yuan sealed, a single blow from that whip would likely keep him bedridden for ten days or half a month.

Yu Feng opened his mouth, seemingly wanting to say something, but before he could speak, another man said, “Don’t worry, Brother Feng. We may not have been at Dragon Lair Mountain for long, but each of us has benefited greatly. How could we ever be ungrateful wolves who bite the hand that fed us? What the hell is Yingyue Hall anyway? Could they have helped so many of us advance one or two Stages in such a short time?”

"Good!" Yu Feng felt a warm surge in his chest and nodded hard; he knew the man spoke truly. Fifty or sixty Haike Family disciples who followed Wu Yi away from their clan to join Dragon Lair Mountain hadn't lacked cultivation resources in these two or three years. Pills and elixirs flowed in, vastly surpassing their former days, and each of them had received at least one or two Secret Treasures for protection—Secret Treasures all of Saint King-Grade caliber.

One could say every Haike Family disciple had come to regard Dragon Lair Mountain as home, developing a deep sense of belonging.

Seeing this, the hulking man realized his questioning was pointless and fell silent. He raised his long whip; just as it was about to fall, the old man seated in the chair suddenly opened his half-closed eyes and turned his head to look outward.

Boom……

A tremendous crash reverberated, accompanied by violent Saint Yuan ripples. A fight seemed to have broken out outside, with shouts and screams briefly sounding before everything fell silent.

"Who dares barge into my Juyuan Hall!" The old man's face chilled as he leapt up. His body blurred as he rushed out, but midair he let out a strange cry and staggered back as if grievously wounded.

A ribbon-like brilliance trailed behind and landed directly inside the side chamber, its force surging like a rainbow as it enveloped the old man.

The old man's face turned pale. He hastily produced a small shield-like defensive Secret Treasure and placed it before him.

With an explosion the old man was forced back several steps before his momentum eased. When he glanced at his shield, his face twitched.

Clinging to his Origin-Grade Lower-Level defensive shield were clusters of burning, pitch-black flames that radiated an unbearably searing heat—its surface already showing signs of melting.

The sight made his soul nearly flee his body; he knew that if he had been struck by one of those flames just now, he might not have died outright — but he would have been flayed of a layer of skin at the very least.

Before he could react further, two surging forces descended from above, enveloping the entire side chamber. Looking up, he saw a strapping young man wrapped in a sheath of cold that strolled in.

Two old men followed behind the youth; like the injured man, they too were cultivators of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. The oppressive auras filling the room came from those two.

The old man's eyes narrowed; the situation was bad. He was the only Origin Returning Realm cultivator stationed here and could not face two at once. He hurriedly withdrew an item from his Spatial Ring and crushed it, finally letting out a stifled breath.

"Yang Kai! Guest Elder Chang! Guest Elder Hao!" Yu Feng and the others cried out in delight the moment they saw the arrivals.

Yang Kai's gaze swept over them; their grievous wounds leapt into sight and his brow tightened, killing intent churning in his heart. Yu Feng and the others were badly hurt—their qi and blood were depleted, their foundations clearly damaged. Had he been another two days late, their cultivation would have regressed. But it was still salvageable; with some Spirit-Grade Pills and rest, they'd recover.

"You're Yang Kai?" The old man was startled and stared at Yang Kai without letting the look go.

Yang Kai glanced at him coldly, showing no intent to entertain him, and signaled Chang Qi with a look.

Chang Qi understood, strode forward, and with Saint Yuan flashing at his fingertips formed a blade, first freeing Yu Feng and the others from their bindings, then examining the sealing marks within them. His brow furrowed.

Although those seals had been placed by cultivators of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, breaking them would still take at least an hour or two—now was clearly not the time.

After bringing Yu Feng and the others beside Yang Kai and whispering a few words, Chang Qi folded his hands and stood aside.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod and then fixed his half-slitted eyes on the old man. "From what you said earlier, it seems you already know me?" he asked.

"Hmph! So what if I do?" the old man snorted.

A playful smile curved Yang Kai's mouth. Then, suddenly, he asked, "Is your surname Xie?"

The old man's face changed subtly, astonishment washing over him as he blurted, "How did you know?"

"So it is!" Yang Kai inclined his head lightly, an expression of understanding across his face. He had suspected as much when speaking with Wu Yi and the others. Even if Dragon Lair Mountain had been implicated by internal strife within Yingyue Hall, then his side shouldn't have been dragged in so deeply.

After all, Dragon Lair Mountain was a major client to anyone; cooperating with it brought benefit, not harm. There was no reason to offend them so senselessly.

Yang Kai instinctively felt that whoever could so wantonly attack Dragon Lair Mountain must harbor enmity toward him. And the only party tied to Yingyue Hall who had cause to hate him was the Xie Family.

Xie Hongwen was a disciple of Yingyue Hall; his father, Xie Li, is also an official within Yingyue Hall. Though his standing is not equal to Qian Tong, he wields some authority.

The Xie Family represented another faction aligned with Yingyue Hall, yet intertwined with it in many ways.

There were only two likely reasons they'd target him: first, suspicion that Xie Hongwen's death was related to Yang Kai. After all, a disciple of Yingyue Hall had warned Xie Hongwen of his location in Flowing Flame Sandland, and since Xie Hongwen never returned from that place, it was assumed he perished there—enough cause for the Xie Family to suspect Yang Kai. So far, nobody from the Xie Family had come after him, perhaps because they feared Qian Tong and that supposedly mythical Origin-Grade artificer.

The second possibility was they were using this as a pretext to probe Yang Kai's side and test Qian Tong!

If Qian Tong still had the strength to protect Dragon Lair Mountain, he would not stand idly by. But from appearances, Qian Tong's situation did not look promising either.

Yang Kai's thoughts raced as he pieced together the scenario. He couldn't be certain of the truth, but his conjecture likely wasn't far off; with a bit of investigation later, he could clarify matters.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai’s mood suddenly lightened. As long as Qian Tong wasn’t the one coming after him, it didn’t really matter. Moreover, since the Xie Family was the one making a move, it proved that the internal strife within Yingyue Hall was truly deep and chaotic — not only was Qian Tong too occupied to manage affairs here, but his opponents clearly had no energy to spare for this place either.

That freed Yang Kai of concern. A mere Xie Family, given Dragon Lair Mountain's present foundation, was hardly worth his worry. If they didn't provoke him, fine; if they dared, he'd show the Xie Family that you do not prod a tiger's behind.

"I am Xie Quan!" The old man, seeing his slip exposed, no longer hid his surname. He sneered, "Since you know I'm of the Xie Family and still dare to damage my Juyuan Hall, you are quite arrogant, boy!"

"Xie Family… heh heh…" Yang Kai let out a low laugh, stroked his chin, and looked at Yu Feng. "Who did this to you?"

Yu Feng hesitated a moment, then pointed toward the hulking man behind Xie Quan.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. His expression suddenly hardened; with a flick of his wrist a golden filament shot straight out and coiled toward the hulking man.

Xie Quan's face changed. He bellowed, "Don't overestimate yourself!"

As he spoke, his aura burst forth. He snapped his fingers and waves of force surged to meet the golden thread.

In his mind, an attack from a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm would be trivial for him to repel—releasing his aura to confront Yang Kai was already him showing mercy.

But the next moment his eyes trembled. That single golden thread sliced his aura to tatters; the force he sent could no longer take shape and had no effect.

Only then did he realize his misjudgment. Hastily, a top-shaped Secret Treasure appeared in his hand, spinning rapidly as dazzling beams shot forth, instantly forming a barrier before the hulking man.

He was an Origin Returning Realm cultivator stationed here; to allow someone to be abducted beneath his nose would be a terrible loss of face.

What shocked him more was that even that barrier couldn't stop the golden thread. The moment the two met the shield burst apart. The next instant the hulking man screamed as a great force swept him up and flung him toward Yang Kai.

"Put him down!" Xie Quan's old face flushed deep red as boundless Saint Yuan erupted from his body. He thrust a palm at Yang Kai, projecting a gigantic palmprint as if to mash him into a pulp.

Yang Kai coldly gave a retort and pushed his own palm forward.

Another enormous palm imprint appeared. When it collided with Xie Quan’s palm imprint, it not only devoured it completely but also unleashed a might that seemed to shroud heaven and earth, sweeping back toward Xie Quan.

Xie Quan's eyes nearly popped out; he had never imagined a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm could directly contend with him and seize the upper hand!
