## Chapter 689 â€” Soul Devouring Worms

On a thousand-zhang solitary peak, Cang Yan, Fei Yu, and Yang Kai landed halfway up the mountain. After carefully investigating for a while, the two Third Stage Transcendent Realm powerhouses locked onto a specific area.

Yang Kai also faintly sensed that this area had a subtle energy leaking out.

But looking around, the area before them was no different from its surroundings; it was just an ordinary patch of ground.

"It should be an illusion technique, and a skillful one at that. No wonder no one discovered the mystery here for so many years," Cang Yan said with a look of astonishment, surveying the area.

"It's probably because so much time has passed that a disciple from the sect inadvertently glimpsed its secret," Fei Yu agreed. "Let's not waste any more time; let's act."

Cang Yan stretched out his foot and stomped on the ground. Along with the transmission of an exceptionally scorching aura, Yang Kai suddenly saw numerous mysterious runes light up on the earth.

Those runes wriggled and struggled on the ground like tadpoles. After a short while, they suddenly all burst into flames and turned to ash.

Cang Yan cultivated a fire-attribute technique; his True Yuan flames were exceptionally pure. With his Third Stage Transcendent Realm strength, breaking an illusion technique left behind from who knows how many years ago was naturally effortless.

A dark, black hole appeared eerily on the ground, just large enough for one person to enter or exit.

Without another word, Fei Yu jumped straight in and quickly disappeared from sight.

Cang Yan waved his hand and said, "Go on in."

"I'm going in too?" Yang Kai was astonished. He had thought he would be waiting up here. After all, over a dozen Tianxiao Sect disciples had met tragic ends inside; it was certainly full of dangers. For him to rashly follow in would only hold these two powerhouses back.

"Of course you're going in," Cang Yan said with a rather sly smile. "This matter will likely depend on you."

"Depend on me?" Yang Kai grew even more surprised. "Senior, you must be joking."

"I'm not joking. If I were alone, I wouldn't have agreed to Fei Yu's request. But with you here, it's different. You'll understand once we're inside." Saying this, Cang Yan directly tossed Yang Kai down.

Yang Kai had no choice but to quietly gather his True Yuan, focus his spirit, and guard against any unforeseen events.

The hole seemed quite deep. Yang Kai slid downward for the time it takes an incense stick to burn before finally stepping onto solid ground. He steadied himself and moved aside. Cang Yan soon landed as well.

"So slow!" Fei Yu pouted with some dissatisfaction.

Cang Yan said nothing. A bright ball of fire suddenly materialized beside him, illuminating the surroundings.

"This is undoubtedly a blessed land. I wonder which senior's cave dwelling this was!" Sensing the Heaven-and-Earth Energy here, Cang Yan's eyes lit up.

Fei Yu also seemed rather excited: "Since it's a blessed land, there must certainly be treasures."

"Very likely!" Cang Yan nodded. "Let's go."

Saying this, he took the lead and went ahead. Fei Yu and Yang Kai followed closely behind him, extremely vigilant.

As they walked, Fei Yu suddenly leaned close to Yang Kai, blowing gently on his ear, and whispered: "Don't use your Divine Sense to probe. There are Soul Devouring Worms here that love Divine Sense energy the most. If they latch onto you, you're finished. That's how those dozen-plus disciples met their misfortune."

Yang Kai's expression turned stern, and he quickly nodded. Suddenly, he grew puzzled again and asked: "Since they met with misfortune, how did you get the news? Did they send a message out?"

"No," Fei Yu shook her head. "The Patriarch said so. Our sect's Patriarch has immense abilities. Everything within a five-hundred-li radius is within his grasp if he wishes it."

Yang Kai's face showed shock.

This Tianxiao Sect Patriarch was truly extraordinary. Yang Kai's own Divine Sense was also exceptionally powerful now, with a perception range of nearly a hundred li. But the farther the distance, the less clear the perception, and the more massive the consumption of Divine Sense energy. Yet this Tianxiao Sect Patriarch could survey the situation within a five-hundred-li range. The two compared, it was simply like heaven and earth.

Cang Yan's steps suddenly halted because before him lay a martial artist wearing Tianxiao Sect robes, lying on his back on the ground, eyes wide open. After bending down to investigate, Cang Yan slowly shook his head.

This person was clearly already dead.

Fei Yu also stopped her whispering with Yang Kai, her pretty face grave. She took out a bell-like Secret Treasure, activated its power, protected herself and Yang Kai, and closely followed behind Cang Yan.

This was likely a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, at least Spirit-Grade level. Once the Secret Treasure was summoned, Yang Kai immediately felt as if he were soaking in water, warm and extremely comfortable.

"Follow me carefully, don't stray too far. With your meager cultivation, if the Soul Devouring Worms target you, death is certain," Fei Yu solemnly warned.

Yang Kai nodded seriously, not daring to be the slightest bit careless.

Cang Yan, highly skilled and bold, kept scouting the path ahead. From time to time, they would encounter one or two unfortunate Tianxiao Sect disciples. Upon careful investigation, most were already dead. Occasionally, three or five were found unconscious, their conditions arduous.

For those unconscious disciples, Cang Yan invariably gave them some Pills to take.

After who knows how long they had walked, a bronze-cast large door suddenly appeared before the trio.

The moment the three reached this spot, a black mist suddenly flew out from the bronze door. Within the mist, countless tiny things invisible to the naked eye ferociously pounced toward the three.

Cang Yan's face changed dramatically, and he quickly retreated. Scorching True Yuan fiercely erupted, balls of firelight exploding, but the black mist simply could not be burned, only slightly slowing its advance.

"Soul Devouring Worms!" Fei Yu cried out in alarm, her flowery countenance losing color. True Yuan burst forth, and sharp, indestructible water arrows rapidly took form, charging toward the black mist with overwhelming force.

"How are there still so many?" Fei Yu's voice trembled slightly. Attacking while she cried out, she said: "Cang Yan, let's go quickly!"

Although she and Cang Yan had reached the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm and were extremely powerful experts, facing these ancient strange insects, they were still somewhat helpless.

The plan for now was only to escape this place, report back to the Patriarch, and then decide what to do.

Cang Yan, however, appeared unhurried. He darted to Fei Yu and Yang Kai's side, stared at the rapidly approaching black mist, and said to Yang Kai: "Use your Divine Sense to burn them!"

Yang Kai was stunned but quickly reacted. In that critical moment, his Divine Sense power erupted.

Whoosh...

A scorching aura spread as a ball of firelight exploded mid-air. The black mist, which had left Cang Yan and Fei Yu helpless, was suddenly burned to ashes.

"Divine Sense Fire?" Fei Yu's beautiful eyes lit up upon seeing this, a different kind of light shimmering within them as she looked at Yang Kai in surprise.

She hadn't expected this young man to possess the extremely rare Divine Sense Fire.

"Don't take on a job you can't handle. Did you think I would accompany you here just to die?" Cang Yan snorted, a look of pride on his face.

Yang Kai's expression was solemn. Upon realizing his Divine Sense Fire was actually the bane of these ancient strange insects, he no longer felt nervous. He stepped forward, walking toward that tightly shut bronze door.

He could sense that within this door, countless tiny lives were still hidden.

Those should be the Soul Devouring Worms.

The over dozen Tianxiao Sect disciples likely met their tragic misfortune right here.

Divine Sense Fire continued to erupt. Those Soul Devouring Worms didn't even get the chance to escape the bronze door before they were all burned to death inside.

Cang Yan and Fei Yu watched with continuous joy.

After a good while, Yang Kai finally withdrew his Divine Sense and nodded to the two: "They should all be dead."

"Little brother, you did quite well," Fei Yu said, swaying her hips as she walked up, amiably patting Yang Kai's shoulder. "This sister likes talented young fellows like you. We must get closer and more intimate in the future."

"Heh heh..." Yang Kai forced a dry laugh.

Cang Yan also walked over, staring at the tightly shut bronze door, a look of eager restlessness on his face.

Since this was a cave dwelling blessed land left behind by ancients, there were sure to be some treasures behind this bronze door.

"Shall we go in and take a look?" Cang Yan turned his head to glance at Fei Yu.

"We've come all this way, how can we just turn back?" Fei Yu said with a light, tinkling laugh.

Yang Kai's eyes flickered, and he spoke up: "I'll wait for you here."

Cang Yan and Fei Yu stared at him. Yang Kai explained: "There might be other traps inside. Me going in would only hold you back."

"That's fine too," Cang Yan nodded. "Then wait here. We'll be back soon."

"Be careful yourself," Fei Yu said in a coquettish tone.

Yang Kai nodded. Cang Yan and Fei Yu pushed open the bronze door, flashed inside, and disappeared.

Only after they had left did Yang Kai slowly approach the front of that bronze door. Staring at it, the corner of his mouth lifted into a subtle arc.

Divine Sense power cleverly burst forth. Soon, wave after wave of black mist surged out from within the bronze door.

The Soul Devouring Worms were not completely dead!

Yang Kai was well aware that Cang Yan and Fei Yu dared not easily release their Divine Sense to investigate. He had used this point to successfully deceive them.

He didn't know why the Tianxiao Sect Patriarch wanted to see him or what they intended, and since his strength on the Tongxuan Continent was limited, the soul-devouring insectsâ€”which could leave even Third-level Transcendents helplessâ€”turned out to be a powerful trump card for him.

One might accuse him of being petty or mistrustful, but Yang Kai still had to make preparations for his own future.

Well aware that there must be treasures behind that bronze door, Yang Kai did not go searching for them. Firstly, to collect these Soul Devouring Worms, and secondly, to avoid any disputes with powerhouses like Cang Yan and Fei Yu.

If he obtained good items but they didn't share with him, Yang Kai felt he would certainly bear a grudge afterward. Out of sight, out of mind was best.

Divine Sense power extended out from his body, pulling those Soul Devouring Worms, guiding them into his own Sea of Consciousness.

Soul Devouring Worms were living creatures, different from the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng. They could not be stored within the Black Book Space.

Under the interference of Yang Kai's Divine Sense power, those Soul Devouring Worms all seemed to become exceptionally docile. Not a single one was missed as they followed his will, surging into his Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai regulated the energies in his Sea of Consciousness so his Divine Sense Flame wouldnâ€™t touch them, and stowed them all on the treasure islet conjured by the Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus.

Throughout the entire Sea of Consciousness, this was the only place without Divine Sense Fire, and also the most suitable place to settle the Soul Devouring Worms.
