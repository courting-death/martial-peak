## Chapter 1793 — A Clear Divide

"Yes, this is indeed the Everlasting Tree, and that drop of Immortal Source Liquid on its leaf belongs to this elder; it was just divided with Ni Guang and Zi Long, and their drops have already been taken. Yang Kai, I have no way to reach into the Seven Luminaries Divine Light to extract its Immortal Source Liquid—do you have any means?" The Ghost Ancestor looked at Yang Kai with expectant eyes.

Although Yang Kai was only at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his deeds constantly astonished the Ghost Ancestor, so at a critical moment like this he could only ask Yang Kai.

What if the brat had another method?

Yang Kai really did have a method; he had already tested it when gathering Heavenly Infant Grass earlier. The Stone Puppet could operate within the Seven Luminaries Divine Light—though it was somewhat affected, the influence was not overwhelming.

So upon hearing the Ghost Ancestor's question, Yang Kai couldn't help but grin: "Easy!"

"Quick, stop him—he absolutely must not be allowed to act!" Zi Long's face changed drastically as he pointed toward Yang Kai and shouted. From the moment Yang Kai had appeared, Zi Long had looked ill at ease, and now, seeing him conversing closely with the Ghost Ancestor, he knew things were turning sour.

The puppets Zi Long and Ni Guang had brought were already damaged beyond use; none present had found a way to handle the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, and the stone man he had seen earlier was unquestionably the pivotal factor that would decide the fate of the Everlasting Tree.

So when he saw Yang Kai about to act, he could no longer restrain himself. Shouting as he rushed, he said to Ni Guang, "Brother Ni, forget our grievances for now—help me take down that brat. He possesses a strange treasure that can resist the Seven Luminaries Divine Light."

"What?" Ni Guang was stunned and turned to look at Yang Kai.

Though he was not close to Yang Kai, they had at least traveled part of the way together before, and he had seen nothing remarkable about him. Hearing Zi Long swear such a thing aroused his curiosity—what treasure could Yang Kai possibly have to withstand the Seven Luminaries Divine Light?

After all, the puppets that Zi Long and Ni Guang had brought were specially forged—whether Purple Star or the Hengluo Commerce Guild, each had only those unique ones.

Yet even those two puppets could not remain in the Seven Luminaries Divine Light for long; their destruction owed partly to mutual attacks, but chiefly to the suppressive power of the Divine Light.

The suppressive power of the Divine Light was terrifying.

Could the strange treasure in Yang Kai's hand be stronger than those two puppets?

"Brother Ni, you don't want to watch the treasure fall into someone else's hands, do you? Why don't we join forces—take the treasure first, then seize the Everlasting Tree, and split it afterwards!" Zi Long spoke rapidly, as if oblivious to Yang Kai's presence, treating him as though he were not worth notice.

Ni Guang frowned and glanced toward Xue Yue.

He wanted to consult Xue Yue's opinion.

Xue Yue slowly shook her head, her expression grave.

Ni Guang understood and said, "Brother Zi, your proposal is unacceptable; forgive me for refusing."

"Ignorant!" Zi Long was furious, his anger blazing; in the present situation he needed Yang Kai's treasure to claim the Everlasting Tree. Seeing Yang Kai standing near the Ghost Ancestor and speaking softly, he believed the two were on the same side. The Ghost Ancestor intimidated him greatly, so he tried to recruit Ni Guang to oppose them, but Ni Guang refused!

Did he not know that if things developed this way, he might never obtain the Everlasting Tree?

The chance to catch the Divine Bird out of its nest was exceedingly rare. If missed, he might never again have the chance in his life to obtain the Everlasting Tree and achieve an undying body.

Zi Long was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan...

The Ghost Ancestor chuckled oddly at the side, black qi roiling about him to show his displeasure. "So you're the head of Purple Star, hm? Fame does not equal reality—your performance disappoints me. Hmph, if you want to deal with my sect's Sect Master, you'll have to go through me first!"

As he spoke, a chorus of wailing and howling issued from the Ghost Ancestor's body. He made a gesture and the Ten Thousand Souls Banner was invoked; it billowed in the wind and transformed into a massive, world-devouring ghost head that hovered in the air.

That ghostly head radiated a chilling, bone-piercing cold. Its huge mouth opened and closed continuously, pitch-black like a bottomless abyss — a sight terrifying to the extreme.

Zi Long's face changed.

"Uncle Ni, let's go to Yang Kai's side too," Xue Yue said softly.

Ni Guang was momentarily stunned, then nodded and wrapped Xue Yue in Saint Yuan before flying to Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor's side.

When he had first entered the Lost Realm, Ni Guang had not thought well of the Ghost Ancestor, judging him to cultivate sinister arts and be malicious and difficult. But when Xu Wei had attacked Xue Yue and she was in peril, it was the Ghost Ancestor who had stepped in to help—Ni Guang had seen that.

Ni Guang was deeply grateful.

So he did not object to Xue Yue's suggestion; he did not know the exact relationship between Xue Yue and Yang Kai, but since she spoke, she evidently stood with Yang Kai.

After landing, Ni Guang gave the Ghost Ancestor a slight nod, and the Ghost Ancestor returned it with a faint laugh.

Two Second Stage Void King Realm experts had immediately joined forces.

Zi Long's expression darkened further.

He stood his ground and glared coldly at the Ghost Ancestor and Ni Guang, his thoughts in turmoil.

He knew that barring accidents, the Everlasting Tree would likely have nothing to do with him now; the two Second Stage Void King Realm experts together held the absolute advantage.

But even so... he could not let them succeed easily!

Zi Long made up his mind and sent a thought through Divine Sense to Xu Wei nearby. Hearing it, Xu Wei raised his head and called to Kong Fa, who stood not far off: "Kong Brother, come here!"

Kong Fa's eyes flicked, evidently wary of Zi Long's demeanor.

Xu Wei gave a short laugh. "Kong Brother, I won't harm you—come without worry."

Kong Fa hesitated a moment and then nodded, strolling over.

Xu Wei then turned his gaze toward Meng Tong.

Before he could speak, Meng Tong chuckled, "We part here—this Meng bids farewell for now; we'll meet again!"

With that he immediately turned and fled at great speed.

He clearly did not want to be involved in this mess. With powerful experts opposing each other, everyone had unknowingly split into two camps; Meng Tong was a Void King Realm cultivator without any backing. He had entered the Lost Realm only to gain benefit and did not wish to be embroiled in such quarrels.

So he decisively left.

He had been the first to arrive and the first to depart, showing he acted cautiously—reaching the Void King Realm was not mere luck.

"Trash!" Zi Long snorted in contempt at Meng Tong's cowardice.

With Meng Tong gone, Zi Long now had only Xu Wei and Kong Fa, both First Stage Void King Realm, while the other side had two Second Stage Void King Realm experts; though his side had one more cultivator numerically, they were still at a disadvantage.

The crucial point remained Yang Kai!

If they could seize Yang Kai and take his strange treasure, it would be a decisive victory.

"How amusing." The Ghost Ancestor watched Zi Long's maneuvers and smiled darkly, "Yang Kai, go ahead and act—while I am here no one dares lay a finger on you!"

"Yang Kai, don't worry—Uncle Ni will watch your back as well," Xue Yue added from the side.

Ni Guang heard this and nodded without hesitation: "I will."

Since Xue Yue had spoken thus, how could he argue? He answered verbally but murmured inwardly; the bond between Xue Yue and Yang Kai seemed closer than he had imagined.

Otherwise, Xue Yue would not have asked him to help.

"Very well, then I leave it to you two!" Yang Kai laughed heartily and made no delay, immediately manifesting his Incarnation.

The golden Incarnation appeared and drew everyone's gaze.

Zi Long, Xu Wei and Zi Donglai had seen the Incarnation before and knew that if Yang Kai wanted the Everlasting Tree he would certainly use this strange treasure; the Ghost Ancestor, Ni Guang and the others were seeing it for the first time.

They all clicked their tongues in amazement.

None of them recognized what the Stone Puppet truly was.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his Soul Incarnation inhabiting the Incarnation as he guided it step by step toward the Everlasting Tree.

"Deluded fantasy!" Zi Long roared in panic and strode forward; the terrifying oppression of a Void King Realm surged toward Yang Kai.

"Hahaha, Brother Zi, let me see your tricks!" Ni Guang laughed and stepped forward as well, his own pressure rising to meet him.

Boom—the oppressive forces of the two Second Stage Void King Realm experts collided nearby, making the surrounding space tremble.

Both emitted muffled groans and swayed slightly.

In that exchange they were evenly matched.

Ni Guang's eyes shone with fierce battle intent as he stared at Zi Long, while Zi Long ground his teeth and shouted, "Ni Guang, do you truly wish to see the Everlasting Tree taken by others? It's not too late to join me now."

Ni Guang sneered, "Join you? Dream on—if the Hengluo Commerce Guild cannot have the Everlasting Tree, neither will Purple Star."

"Fine, you leave me no choice." Zi Long's fury exploded and he suddenly radiated a purple brilliance that seemed almost tangible; at the same time, the roar of ocean waves echoed from within him, like a tidal wave.

"Purple Qi Long River Technique!" Ni Guang's face darkened as he realized Zi Long was desperate and prepared to fight to the death. He did not hesitate and pushed his cultivation to the limit; in an instant Ni Guang shone with golden light, as if forged from metal, majestic and unyielding.

Spiritual Qi in the heavens and earth roiled as the domains of the two Void King Realm experts extended, touched and clashed.

With a long howl, Zi Long became a streak of purple light and charged Ni Guang without hesitation.

Ni Guang roared and transformed into gold as he met the charge.

The ensuing cataclysmic clash sent shockwaves outward as the purple and golden lights met in midair, neither yielding any ground; their Saint Yuan power sprayed in all directions like the end of days.
