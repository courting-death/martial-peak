## Chapter 884 — Those Who Dare Threaten Me Meet a Grim Fate

Yang Kai's enraged shout thundered in the air like a roaring bell; the yellow-robed man's body trembled and he instinctively shoved into the crowd, desperate to find some scrap of safety.

No matter where he fled, it felt as if a sharp sword hung directly above his head—death's presence pressed in on him.

"You dare lay a hand on me? You will regret it for the rest of your life!"

The yellow-robed man snarled, his voice shaking, utterly hysterical.

"Threaten me?" Yang Kai sneered, disdain written all over his face. "Those who dare threaten me meet a grim fate!"

Tsk...

A strange, subtle sound slipped out, and the yellow-robed man hiding in the crowd suddenly felt a force surge into his body. In the next moment his flesh swelled like a balloon, rapidly puffing up to grotesque proportions.

His face flushed crimson; he could clearly feel his organs, blood, and bones being compressed and crushed by this unnatural expansion.

Agonizing pain ripped through him, and blood poured from his seven orifices.

Terror overwhelmed him—he felt death was imminent—yet his senses remained unnervingly sharp.

"S...save me..." the yellow-robed man croaked out between labored breaths; his eyes rolled back until there was only white, his whole body twitching uncontrollably.

Plop...

A muffled sound followed as the yellow-robed man suddenly burst into a spray of blood and water; only shards of bone remained.

Flesh and entrails flew in all directions, painting the nearby cultivators a sickening red.

Everyone's eyes shook with fear; each person fell silent, utterly terrified.

The braggarts who had been shouting before no longer dared meet Yang Kai's gaze, terrified he might strike again and slaughter them as well.

"This is what happens to those who threaten me!" Yang Kai laughed, pleasure on his face. He looked as if he had completed a trivial task, completely at ease.

His expression suddenly chilled. He growled, "If you came here simply to enjoy yourselves, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land welcomes you. But if you came with sinister aims, don't blame me for being merciless."

Hissss...

Streams of golden True Yuan shot out like fang-like serpents, honing in on several cultivators in the crowd as if they had been singled out, penetrating their bodies without missing a hair's breadth.

Like the yellow-robed man, these cultivators swelled until they reached their limit and then exploded, tasting a soul-deep terror in the moments before death.

Seeing Yang Kai kill on a whim and with no sign of stopping, none of the gathered cultivators dared remain. They let out frantic screams and fled for their lives with every ounce of strength they had.

None of them were willing to linger outside the Nine Peaks any longer.

With a flick of his hand, Yang Kai sent a chain-like strand of True Yuan hurtling out, which wrapped around and bound a middle-aged man trying to flee, dragging him back.

The middle-aged man trembled all over, his face ashen—everyone else had escaped to safety, yet he alone had been singled out. He begged loudly, kowtowing like a pestle on mortar.

"You were the loudest earlier," Yang Kai sneered as he looked down at him with contempt.

"Saint Lord, have mercy! I won't do it again; I will never come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land again. Saint Lord, please spare me!"

Yang Kai's face curled with scorn as he looked down at him. "I won't kill you this time. But you will deliver a message for me."

The man hurriedly agreed, "Whatever the Saint Lord says, I'll tell him!"

"I don't care who ordered you to do this," Yang Kai said. "Tell them when you return that if they dare employ such despicable tricks to provoke me again, I will personally descend upon their sect, annihilate their clan, and leave nothing—neither man nor beast—behind!"

The man's face went numb; he finally realized Yang Kai had seen through their ruse and nodded fervently. "I will deliver the message!"

"Leave!" Yang Kai barked.

The middle-aged man thanked him and stumbled away as fast as he could.

Watching the man flee, Shi Kun's expression grew grave. He asked with concern, "Saint Lord, could this cause trouble?"

"Don't worry—just a few jumping clowns; they're dead now," Yang Kai shook his head. "Next time we catch anyone scheming against the Sacred Land outside its bounds, kill them on the spot once the facts are clear—no need to reason with them."

"Yes!" Shi Kun replied quickly, his eyes brightening as he looked at Yang Kai.

He realized this Saint Lord's temperament differed greatly from the previous one; the old Saint Lord acted for the greater good, weighing every decision and avoiding anything that might harm the Sacred Land.

But this Saint Lord was different—his methods were ruthless and his personality cold.

Such a temperament suited Shi Kun down to the ground.

Truly a young man, overflowing with vigor—Shi Kun hoped the Sacred Land would grow vigorous like its Saint Lord.

Those cultivators loitering outside the Nine Peaks were nothing more than small-time players; Yang Kai hadn't given them a second thought — if he hadn't happened to run into them on his way back, he wouldn't have bothered to intervene.

After instructing Shi Kun with a few words, Yang Kai returned to the Nine Peaks.

Li Rong bowed respectfully and took her leave, saying she would distribute those few Saint-Grade Secret Treasures to the captains so they could refine them and increase their combat power.

The Saint Lord's Court!

It was the residence of the ruler of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Generations of Saint Lords had lived within this exquisite, grand complex, enjoying the best views and the densest Spiritual Qi atop the mountain peaks.

Now that Yang Kai commanded the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, this place naturally became his residence.

Besides him, another person lived here—the Saintess An Ling'er.

According to the Sacred Land's old customs, a Saintess exists for the Saint Lord; everything about the Saintess is prepared to make the Saint Lord stronger, and she may even devote her life to him.

Each Saintess had been indoctrinated with this notion since childhood.

When Yang Kai returned, he found An Ling'er in her private chamber, propping her delicate cheek in her hand at the table; her eyes were rimmed with red and her spirit seemed to be wandering far away.

Yang Kai watched her for a while; she did not respond.

Only when he sat across from her did An Ling'er suddenly startle awake, springing to her feet and offering a graceful salute: "Saint Lord, you've returned?"

"No need to be so formal," Yang Kai said with a wry smile as he poured himself a cup of tea. "What about Saintess Nan... how is she?"

An Ling'er's expression dimmed when Yang Kai asked, and she said softly, "Still the same..."

"What do you plan to do?"

"I want to try to dissolve the fixation in her heart. But I don't know how!"

Saintess Nan was a living corpse—she moved only because of the fixation in her heart. If that fixation were resolved, her body would cease and she would finally rest.

Yang Kai thought the simplest solution would be to shatter Saintess Nan's corpse and be done with it, but An Ling'er had deep feelings for her and clearly couldn't bear that.

"Is there no record of this in the Sacred Land's annals?" Yang Kai frowned.

"There should be!" An Ling'er wiped her eyes. "The records mention that the Sacred Land has encountered such cases before."

"Be patient and look—perhaps you'll find a method to resolve it," Yang Kai comforted.

An Ling'er nodded gently. "I've been thinking the same..."

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai noticed An Ling'er hesitated, as if she had something hard to say.

He smiled, "Don't be formal with me—say whatever's on your mind. If I can help, I will."

An Ling'er's cheeks flushed; she pressed her lips together and whispered, "Actually, the elders have been asking..."

"Asking about what?"

"Asking... about us." An Ling'er's face reddened; her eyes filled with watery emotion and she looked embarrassed.

Yang Kai was taken aback, then realized and forced a wry smile. "What's their hurry?"

"Of course they're anxious," An Ling'er scoffed. "You're the head of the Sacred Land—they all want you to grow quickly and become a dominant force."

Each generation of Saint Lords grew at astonishing speed through practices with Saintesses.

Moreover, every Saint Lord managed to reach the peak of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

That was why the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had stood so long and held such renown on the Tongxuan Continent.

"What do you want to do?" Yang Kai asked seriously, looking at An Ling'er.

An Ling'er lowered her head, twisting at her sleeve with nervous fingers. She stammered, "We Saintesses are taught from childhood to obey the Saint Lord—everything is for the Saint Lord—so this matter... it's up to you. I'll follow whatever you say."

An Ling'er's obedient posture left Yang Kai feeling a little overwhelmed.

Saintesses were already extraordinarily beautiful—one-in-a-million beauties—and now with that expression, any man would be moved.

Yang Kai felt the pull of her charm in that moment.

He sighed lightly, straightened his expression, and asked in a deep voice, "You said before we're friends, right?"

An Ling'er nodded slightly.

"Then as a friend I'll be frank with you..." Yang Kai said solemnly. "I went through certain things in the Sacred Tomb and learned why a Saint Lord can advance so quickly."

"What secret?" An Ling'er asked, intrigued—though a Saintess, she wasn't fully aware of this confidential matter.

"The reason a Saint Lord can rise so fast and reach the Third Stage of the Saint Realm is that their cultivation consumes the life force of both the Saint Lord and the Saintess to obtain power."

"Consume life force?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded and explained carefully: "Everyone has differing degrees of life force. The more vigorous the life force, the longer one can live; the weaker it is, the shorter the life. And as a cultivator strengthens, their life force tends to increase. The method cultivated by Saint Lords, however, is dependent on sacrificing life force. Hence every Saint Lord appears prodigious and powerful, but their lifespan is short."

An Ling'er's mouth opened slightly as if she'd heard an extraordinary secret.

"I won't cultivate that method, and I won't let you cultivate it either!" Yang Kai said gravely. "I want to live a long life. You're my friend—I don't want to see my friend die young."

An Ling'er's eyes brightened; she seemed touched.

"I don't have many friends. You're one of them. I hope we cherish what we have now. Saint Lord and Saintess are just external titles—between us, let's be equals. How about that?"

An Ling'er nodded without hesitation.
