## Chapter 1678 — The Power of the Force Tyrant Body

When her first strike failed to take down the opponent as she’d imagined, the young girl reacted with astonishing speed—her body dropped low, then spun into a midair kick. Golden light flared at her toes, sharp and radiant like the gleam of a drawn sword.

The Golden Sword of the Undying Five Elements Sword! Indestructible and unstoppable.

Her little foot seemed to have transformed into a razor-sharp blade, stabbing straight toward Yang Kai's chest.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, reached out and gripped the girl's ankle, and with a press of Saint Yuan, he neutralized her assault, holding her up in his hand like a toy.

The hems of the girl's skirt fluttered, nearly revealing more than they should, but she was quick-eyed and quick-handed and clamped her skirt down.

She was full of fury when, all of a sudden, she looked down and saw Yang Kai's smiling face beneath her.

“Eh… Sect Master Uncle!” The young girl recognized Yang Kai at a glance, her delicate face lighting up with a joyful smile as she called out sweetly.

“So it really is you!” Yang Kai nodded slightly, giving a gentle twist of his wrist to set the girl down properly. Staring at her tender face, he frowned and said, “Yun'er, what are you doing here?”

This young girl was clearly the little girl Huang Juan once took in—Lin Yun'er!

Years ago, when Yang Kai returned from the Imperial Garden and passed by a city beside the Wuyou Sea, he happened upon Huang Juan and brought her back to Lingxiao Sect, along with a little wench.

At that time Lin Yun'er was only five or six years old, but she had already shown astonishing physical strength.

Yang Kai had sensed something abnormal about her body and asked Ye Xijun to investigate; later Ye Xijun reported that Lin Yun'er possessed an extraordinary constitution—the Force Tyrant Body!

This is an extremely rare constitution. It might be related to some sea beast bloodline, after all Huang Juan had said Lin Yun'er's mother carried sea beast blood.

A martial artist with this constitution is born with godlike strength, and as their cultivation rises, their strength grows ever more terrifying.

Before leaving Dark Star, Yang Kai had passed on the Undying Five Elements Sword; in the blink of seven or eight years, the little girl who had been five or six was now a budding, inexperienced flower.

From the multicolored glow about her, the Undying Five Elements Sword had already reached some measure of completion. Coupled with her Force Tyrant Body, the power she could unleash was fearsome.

Her cultivation was not high—under Yang Kai's probing she was only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Even so, Lingxiao Sect now lacked for nothing in wealth and resources, and with an expert like Ye Xijun personally instructing her, to reach the Third Stage of the Saint Realm in seven or eight years was a prodigious talent.

This little girl was without a doubt a future dazzling star of the Star Domain!

Yang Kai looked at her as if gazing upon a future supreme expert.

And the Undying Five Elements Sword he had given her seemed tailored for her; combined with her Force Tyrant Body, she could, with only Second or Third Stage Saint Realm cultivation, stand up to an Origin Returning Realm practitioner of the First Stage!

Such a level of cross-realm combat ability far exceeded Yang Kai’s expectations.

Even he, at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, could not withstand the attack of an Origin Returning Realm expert.

However, it was clear she had exhausted nearly all the power within her, and bore various wounds—she was plainly spent.

Still, her spirit remained quite good.

“When Dark Star fell into chaos, Yun'er happened to be following the Great Elder's orders on business at Qiantian Sect and couldn't return, so she stayed here,” Lin Yun'er said somewhat aggrievedly.

Two years ago she had been only eleven or twelve; after two years adrift she missed Lingxiao Sect terribly—missed Ye Xijun who had taught her, missed Huang Juan who had cared for her like a mother, missed every blade of grass and every Senior Brother and Senior Sister in Lingxiao Sect.

She had always been strong, perhaps because she had lost her parents as a child, but upon seeing Yang Kai now her large eyes misted over and her small mouth pouted.

“I see! But why are you on this battlefield?” Yang Kai frowned. He didn't know who the city lord of Haicheng City was, and why they had put Lin Yun'er out here fighting.

He could see that those who had gone out to meet the enemy were almost all fighting with the resolve to die delaying for time. Lin Yun'er was, after all, of Lingxiao Sect, and at such a young age this matter should never have fallen to her.

“I went out on my own. I wanted to do what I could.” Lin Yun'er sniffed.

“Good.” Yang Kai nodded heavily, ruffling Lin Yun'er's head. Thinking a moment, he withdrew a restorative Spiritual Pill from his Spatial Ring and handed it to her. “Take this.”

“Mm.” Lin Yun'er trusted Yang Kai completely; even after seven or eight years apart she swallowed the Spiritual Pill without a word.

Yang Kai looked up and said to Xia Ningshang, “Little Senior Sister, escort them back to the city!”

“Yes!” Xia Ningshang replied, her pure hand sweeping as she formed intricate seals.

The world's Spiritual Qi was drawn and, guided by Xia Ningshang, those currents transformed into streaming light that flowed into the exhausted fighters' bodies.

In the next moment, every Qiantian Sect warrior who had been drained trembled as their vigor returned; they became spirited and full of energy.

Gazes upon Xia Ningshang were full of astonishment!

They had no idea how she had managed to refine the Spiritual Qi and channel it into them, moistening their nearly dried meridians and dantian.

“Follow me!” Xia Ningshang called, the pale blue gem on her brow flashing dazzling light, making her look like a goddess descended; wherever the glow passed, enemies felt an inexplicable force well up in their hearts and their fighting zeal waned.

Leading fewer than a hundred, Xia Ningshang carved a bloody path through the enemy and joined Du Yanling and the others.

Yang Kai soared into the sky, releasing his Divine Sense to search for the stronger enemies on the battlefield. The Golden Blood Threads moved at his will, becoming streaks of golden light that madly reaped the lives of the Corpse Spirit Sect's disciples!

Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi and Lin Yurao formed a triangular formation and had already raised a storm within the enemy ranks; where the three passed, corpses were strewn.

The Chaotic Heaven Sun Tower, under Mo Yu's control, grew and shrank erratically, and its emanating blue mystic light kept the enemies at bay.

A group of seven or eight had thoroughly thrown the Corpse Spirit Sect's army into chaos.

Soon someone realized the danger: on the battlefield the Corpse Spirit Sect's experts were being killed one by one, command vanished, and the remainder were scattered skirmishers, unable to mount effective resistance.

This situation worsened when Du Yanling and her group burst out and counterattacked.

The Corpse Spirit Sect's army collapsed like a crumbling wall; the Corpse Spirits screamed and fled, and the sects and families allied with the Corpse Spirit Sect also fled in panic.

Du Yanling and the others' eyes were blood-red. They pursued for tens of thousands of li, slaughtering until the Corpse Spirit Sect was utterly routed before returning victorious.

At this moment Haicheng City was a tide of voices; the whole city seemed to be boiling.

The Corpse Spirit Sect's forces had besieged Haicheng City for a full year. Qiantian Sect's strength had worn down time and again, and the city seemed on the brink of ruin—until at this critical juncture someone burst forth and turned the tide, not only saving Haicheng City from destruction but dealing a severe blow to the Corpse Spirit Sect's morale.

Everyone sought to learn the origin of the reinforcements.

Only when they learned the newcomers were Qiantian Sect's Great Elder Mo Yu and Lingxiao Sect's Sect Master and elders did they come to understand.

No wonder those people possessed such powerful combat strength; no wonder they had routed the Corpse Spirit Sect's forces—so it was these people!

For a time, the reputations of Qiantian Sect and Lingxiao Sect in Haicheng City rose like the sun.

Inside the city lord's manor.

Some remaining Qiantian Sect high-ranking members sat with Yang Kai and the others.

Du Yanling, city lord of Haicheng City and also a Qiantian Sect elder, bowed deeply to Yang Kai and the others and said in a grave voice, “Sect Master Yang and all of you, my thanks. Had you not acted, Haicheng City would surely have been slaughtered. On behalf of the million lives within Haicheng City, I thank Sect Master Yang and you for saving us.”

“City Lord Du, you flatter us. This Yang is no stranger to Elder Mo; we had to lend aid!” Yang Kai smiled and waved his hand.

His humility made Du Yanling regard him warmly and study him more closely.

It should be said, on Dark Star Yang Kai was almost a legend.

His fame had risen quickly, but his deeds had been earth-shattering.

The battle at Dragon Lair Mountain had made him shine; he then claimed the forbidden Flowing Flame Sandland on Dark Star, established a sect, and with the strength of that sect annihilated Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect and brought Star Emperor Mountain under submission.

Yang Kai and Lingxiao Sect had become among the best-known existences on Dark Star!

During the two years of chaos on Dark Star, Lingxiao Sect had done much, frequently sending experts to aid besieged sects and cities, earning gratitude across the human race.

As Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai was virtually the foremost person on Dark Star—when he stamped his foot, Dark Star trembled.

This was Du Yanling's first time meeting Yang Kai, so naturally she was curious.

But even observing him at her Third Stage Origin Returning Realm level, she could not gauge Yang Kai's depth; this young-looking man seemed even stronger than the Great Elder and the Sect Master who had already died.

Du Yanling was shocked!

“Junior Sister, with Haicheng City's situation so dire, what of Qiantian Sect's headquarters?” Mo Yu asked anxiously.

Du Yanling and a few informed elders' expressions darkened.

Mo Yu read the room and felt a bad premonition, urgently asking, “Could it be that the headquarters—”

Du Yanling nodded mournfully: “The headquarters has been breached; the Sect Master, elder Gu Zhen, has fallen in battle!”

“What?” Mo Yu sprang up, swaying slightly as if unable to accept the outcome.

Yang Kai sighed softly as well.

Qiantian Sect's Sect Master Gu Zhen was someone he had met a few times; a decent man with top-tier Third Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivation—yet he had perished.

“Great Elder Mo, please accept our condolences.” Du Yanling did not know what else to say.

“How could the headquarters have been breached, and why has Haicheng City held out until now?” Mo Yu's face was darkly frightening.

Du Yanling replied in grief: “There were traitors colluding with the Corpse Spirit Sect—so the headquarters could not be held!”

“What people?” Mo Yu demanded fiercely.

“They’re already dead… the Sect Master took them down with him,” Du Yanling said sorrowfully.

Mo Yu sat stunned for a long time, as if all his strength had left him; he collapsed into a chair and could not speak a word.
