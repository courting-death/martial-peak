## Chapter 1301 — Meeting Shen Shitao Again

When they entered Zangxiong Valley, because they had to search and scout, the two moved slowly and could only proceed on foot; but now as they departed, Yang Kai piloted the Star Shuttle, so the time required would naturally not be so long.

Just as Yang Kai hurriedly rushed outward with Yang Yan, he suddenly halted, seeming to notice something as he looked off to the side into the distance, emitting a soft exclamation and showing a look of surprise.

"What's wrong?" Yang Yan asked in astonishment, not knowing why Yang Kai had suddenly stopped.

“Nothing,” Yang Kai replied calmly. “I just ran into one of those people from before again—but she seems a little off.”

Over there a figure was hastening this way; whether by coincidence or not, she was headed straight toward Yang Kai, and under Yang Kai's deliberate scrutiny he realized the newcomer was the woman who had been following Shen Shitao, called Lü Ying.

But now she looked flustered, her Saint Yuan fluctuations extremely unstable, appearing somewhat disheveled, as if she'd just gone through a grueling battle.

Aside from her, Qiantian Sect's Shen Shitao, Jidao Sect's Shen Fanlei and Wang Yuhan were nowhere to be seen; nobody knew where they'd gone.

It was obvious they were in trouble. If it had been a stranger, Yang Kai would have immediately moved away — after all, not long ago he had provoked those strange existences in the Corpse Den; he had no mind to linger.

But they were people he knew; if he hadn't seen them it would be one thing, but having seen them and simply walking off left Yang Kai feeling uneasy.

After all, it was thanks to Shen Shitao that he knew this place was Zangxiong Valley.

After a moment's thought Yang Kai bit his teeth and piloted the Star Shuttle to meet Lü Ying.

Lü Ying was fleeing while looking around as if searching for something; suddenly she sensed someone approaching and was startled, glancing toward Yang Kai; upon seeing his face she was overjoyed, her vigilance and panic vanished, and she hurried to meet him.

Before he was even close, she tremulously called out, "Senior Brother Yang!"

"Miss Lü Ying!" Yang Kai rushed up and stopped before her, asking with some suspicion, "What's got you so panicked?"

"Senior Brother Yang, hurry and save Senior Sister Shen and the others — they're being targeted by a Ninth-Tier demonic beast."

"A Ninth-Tier demonic beast?" Yang Kai's face darkened. "How could there be a demonic beast here? And a Ninth-Tier at that."

A Ninth-Tier demonic beast — that was essentially on par with the Origin Returning Realm. For such a special place as Zangxiong Valley to contain a demonic beast was far beyond his expectations.

"I don't know either. But there really is a Ninth-Tier demonic beast there. Senior Sister Shen and the others are trapped; they managed to get me out to find help. Senior Brother Yang, please hurry — if you delay it might be too late."

“Miss Lü Ying must be joking,” Yang Kai did not immediately agree but frowned instead. “My cultivation is only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm—my strength is inferior to Miss Shen’s and that Brother Wang’s. If even they were trapped, wouldn’t I just be walking to my death if I went over?”

Lü Ying froze at his words, seeming to come to terms with it.

She had been desperate to find someone, and places like Zangxiong Valley were seldom frequented; having finally seen Yang Kai she naturally asked for help, but Yang Kai's reminder suddenly drained the color from her face.

She had witnessed the beast's ferocity herself — it took the combined strength of all four to barely hold it off. Even if Yang Kai went, given his realm how could he turn the tide? He'd likely be dragged in and unable to escape.

For a moment Lü Ying stood stunned, utterly flustered.

Though Yang Kai hadn't agreed, he asked further, "What type of demonic beast is it? How strong exactly?"

Lü Ying instinctively replied, "It's a lightning-type demonic beast. Its strength should only be equivalent to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, but by using a nearby Thunder Pool and the surrounding restriction it can perform beyond its level; otherwise Senior Sister Shen and the others wouldn't be trapped and unable to escape — even if it's stronger, escape should still be possible."

"Thunder Pool?" Before Yang Kai could answer, Yang Yan's eyes lit up, clearly very interested.

"Yes, the Thunder Pool here is well known. This time Senior Sister Shen's younger brother, Shen Fanlei, intended to use that Thunder Pool to cultivate a secret technique to break through his current bottleneck, but this unexpected incident occurred," Lü Ying hastily explained.

Yang Kai glanced at Yang Yan, and Yang Yan's voice suddenly came through to his ear: "I want the thunder-liquid in that Thunder Pool!"

Yang Kai sighed, knowing this time he would probably have to go. Not that he had intended to stand idly by, and now that Yang Yan was also interested in that thunder-liquid, it must be something very useful.

His earlier words had only been out of caution.

With that thought, Yang Kai no longer hesitated and said, "Miss Lü Ying, lead the way. Though my strength is limited, since Miss Shen is in peril I cannot stand by. I can't promise anything; I'll only say I'll do my best."

"Ah?" Lü Ying's expression shifted from worry to joy. She had thought Yang Kai was unwilling, but in a blink the situation turned; overjoyed, she immediately nodded and led the way.

But she didn't seem to place too much hope in Yang Kai; along the way she remained anxious, spreading her Divine Sense to probe for any more powerful martial practitioners nearby.

But to her disappointment, she found nothing.

Along the way, from questioning, Yang Kai learned their main purpose in coming to Zangxiong Valley was that Thunder Pool. Everything had been peaceful; after finding it Shen Fanlei entered the pool, drew thunder into his body and began cultivating his secret art, with the other three guarding. But a few days later a Silver Night Thunder Beast sprang up from beneath the pool, not only ruining Shen Fanlei's cultivation, but the beast was no simple-minded creature — it triggered the restrictions around the Thunder Pool and trapped all four, clearly intent on killing the intruders.

Because Lü Ying had a Secret Treasure suited for escape, upon realizing they couldn't win and couldn't break free, Shen Shitao, together with Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei, forcibly tore open part of the restriction to let Lü Ying escape.

But because the restriction was arranged beside the Thunder Pool and was continuously replenished by the thunderpower there, the other three couldn't escape in time and remained trapped.

A full day and night had passed since Lü Ying escaped to find help; no one knew how things were over there.

"So much time has passed—might it be too late?" Yang Kai sighed slightly.

"No," Lü Ying immediately waved her hand. "Senior Sister Shen has a powerful defensive Secret Treasure; even if she's outmatched it can hold for some time."

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

Lü Ying explained proactively, "We must also thank Senior Brother Yang. Last time in the Flowing Flame Sandland we gathered a large amount of Saint Crystals; after returning and turning them over to the sect, the elders bestowed rare Secret Treasures on us. Senior Sister Shen received a Nine Palace Sky-Net Umbrella — an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure — which she had long taken into her body and could wield at will. The escape treasure I used was also given by the elders; otherwise, given my strength I couldn't have escaped."

"I see!" Yang Kai relaxed a little. With an Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure protecting her, Shen Shitao shouldn't be in too much danger; otherwise when he arrived he'd only be collecting their bodies, which would be tragic.

The Thunder Pool wasn't close to where the three had been; it took a full half-day to reach the destination.

Along the way Yang Kai closely watched his surroundings, fearing some corpse soldiers might suddenly appear to ambush him; after all he couldn't be sure whether those strange beings from the Corpse Den would follow — agreeing to rescue Shen Shitao was, in truth, a risk.

When they were ten li away from the Thunder Pool, Lü Ying pointed in the distance and exclaimed with delight, "There it is — it looks like Senior Sister and the others are indeed safe!"

Yang Kai had already noticed the disturbance without her reminder. In the distance, a vast mass of azure clouds pressed low over the sky, within which lightning flickered like foxfire—every now and then, a bolt of thunder crashed down, its might astonishing. Beneath those clouds spread a barrier shimmering with lightning light, covering the ground below. Though the scene within was not clearly visible, the sounds of battle made it clear that Shen Shitao and the others were still alive—albeit their auras were faint and weakening. Judging by the situation, they were likely reaching their limit.

Seeing this, Yang Kai said without hesitation, "Let's go."

In a blink his figure moved a hundred zhang and charged straight toward it, Lü Ying close behind; she opened her lips and let out a clear, birdlike sound that rose and fell like a songbird's call, yet concealed information imperceptible to outsiders.

At the sound, Shen Shitao, who had been desperately holding on beside the Thunder Pool, brightened and cried sweetly, "It's Junior Sister Lü Ying — she's brought help; now we're saved."

At that, Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei both felt a surge of spirit and simultaneously activated their defensive Secret Treasures, warding off the bolts of lightning striking them.

It was thanks to the three of them standing firm in defense without counterattacking that they had lasted this long.

"Senior Sister Shen!" After a moment, Lü Ying's sweet call came from outside.

Shen Shitao heard it and turned to look, delighted: "Junior Sister Lü Ying — did you find help?"

"Yes, I haven't let you down, Senior Sister; I brought Senior Brother Yang," Lü Ying hurriedly nodded.

"Senior Brother Yang?" Shen Shitao said in astonishment, looking behind Lü Ying to see Yang Kai standing gravely, watching the scene inside without saying a word.

“Brother Yang…” Shen Shitao was caught between laughter and tears. She never could have imagined that the helper Lü Ying had found would turn out to be Yang Kai. Though she had once deemed him a man of great fortune, luck had little to do with their current predicament — relying on luck alone here would still mean certain death.
