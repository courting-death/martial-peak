## Chapter 2377 — Lawless

Fan Xin from Ice Heart Pavilion quickly joined Ling Yinqin, and the two began exchanging secret messages.

After a short while, Ling Yinqin looked up at Yang Kai and said, "Junior Sister Fan's offer is quite reasonable. I'm ready to sell. What do you think?"

She asked this clearly just for show, so Fan Xin could see. Besides, her cultivation was a stage higher than Fan Xin's, so calling her Junior Sister was perfectly appropriate.

Fan Xin immediately looked at Yang Kai with hopeful eyes. She had spent most of the day here without any gains, and now, finally, she saw a glimmer of hope. As long as Yang Kai nodded, she would receive quite a lot, so she was naturally excited.

Yang Kai smiled and said, "Go ahead and sell."

Fan Xin's face lit up with joy. "Thank you, Senior Sister and Young Brother. Rest assured, Ice Heart Pavilion always conducts honest business. We never undercut prices."

Ling Yinqin replied coolly, "I've known of Ice Heart Pavilion's reputation for a long time; otherwise I wouldn't sell to you."

As they spoke, the transaction was completed swiftly. Yang Kai quietly checked and found that Fan Xin had given Ling Yinqin not only some Source Crystals but also a few Spiritual Pills.

Having received the goods, Fan Xin was extremely pleased and became even more enthusiastic. She said, "Young Brother, if you have anything else to sell in the future, remember me. The price is always negotiable."

Yang Kai nodded. "No problem."

"Let's go," Ling Yinqin called out, leading Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun forward.

After leaving the bustling dock, the three stopped and waited for the others to arrive.

After about the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the rest of the dozen or so crew members returned, all beaming with joy and excitement. Clearly, their harvest had been plentiful. What they had just sold at the dock was only a small portion of their gains from this trip—there was still much more they hadn’t revealed yet.

The hundred thousand Cangyu Coral was too much to sell at once, and clearly not suitable for dockside trading. Ling Yinqin planned to wait until they returned to Tongtian City to deal with it.

Just this one trip's harvest was enough to ensure they wouldn't worry about food or drink for the next three years, and they could even move to a better place to live.

Not long after, a massive city appeared ahead. The city gate was enormous, like a beast's open mouth ready to devour people. At the top of the gate, three large characters were carved: Tongtian City!

At the gate, martial artists stood guard. All who entered or exited had to pay one Lower-Level Source Crystal or something of equal value to pass.

Seeing this, Yang Kai frowned.

Source Crystals were extremely valuable in the Jixu Secret Realm. He had thought that having an identity token would allow free passage, but it turned out a Source Crystal was still required. One Lower-Level Source Crystal meant little to him, but for those who lived here long-term and were poor, it was a significant expense.

There weren't many people at the gate. Aside from the martial artists returning from the dock, no one was leaving. It was clear that those inside Tongtian City were reluctant to spend a Source Crystal just to go in and out. Only those who needed to go to sea or had to leave would do so.

Ling Yinqin's group of more than a dozen paid their Source Crystals and had their identity tokens checked, then entered the city with ease.

Yang Kai had worried his newcomer status might be exposed, but seeing how simple things were, he realized he was overthinking it.

Inside the city, it was bustling. Martial artists filled the streets, shops lined both sides, and the crowds were endless.

But he soon noticed something different. On both sides of the street, many martial artists sat cross-legged, staring blankly ahead, their expressions wooden.

There were quite a few of these martial artists, regardless of cultivation level, and all seemed extremely weak. It was as if they hadn't cultivated in ages; they just sat there, unmoving.

Not only that, but there were also many beggars wandering the streets, constantly begging and bowing, but rarely receiving anything.

Yang Kai frowned, surprised that the seemingly prosperous Tongtian City was so bleak inside.

"They're all pitiful," Ling Yinqin sighed. "Without cultivation resources, their strength declines, and they can't go to sea to find anything. All that's left is begging or waiting to die."

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally understood why the streets looked this way. Just entering the city, he saw so many waiting to die—who knew how many more there were in all of Tongtian City?

"Is there really no way to leave here?" Yang Kai asked.

Ling Yinqin shook her head. "I've never heard of anyone successfully leaving."

As they spoke, a shout rang out nearby: "Thief! How dare you steal from me!"

The shout caused a commotion in the crowd, and the sounds of fighting followed.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and immediately saw what was happening. A martial artist was being robbed. The victim had the cultivation of the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, while the robber was only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, much weaker and extremely feeble—barely as strong as a First Stage Void King.

Such suicidal behavior would never happen outside, but in Tongtian City, it seemed normal.

With a couple of loud bangs, the robber was killed on the spot, and the victim reclaimed his Spatial Ring. The Dao Origin Realm martial artist was about to say something harsh when suddenly, countless blank-faced people surged from both sides of the street. Their eyes, once empty, now burned red, all fixed on the Spatial Ring, fighting fiercely for it.

Even though the owner of the Spatial Ring was a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, two fists couldn't beat many hands. He killed several, but no one backed down, and soon he was overwhelmed by the crowd.

Swish, swish...

As the struggle reached its peak, two figures suddenly descended from the sky. Both wore black battle suits, their presence imposing, and they watched the fight with cold, mocking eyes, making no move to intervene.

"Those are members of Tongtian City's law enforcement team," Jiao Yi quietly explained to Yang Kai.

"They don't intervene?" Yang Kai asked in surprise. If they were law enforcement, shouldn't they maintain order? Why did they just watch the brawl?

Jiao Yi sneered, "Just watch."

With a couple more blows, the robber was sent flying, but the victim was clearly exhausted. Though better off than the beggars, his strength had declined sharply since coming to Tongtian Island, and he couldn't use his Dao Origin Realm power. Now, he was battered and spent.

Looking up, he saw the two law enforcers in black robes and quickly cried out, "Sirs, help! These people are lawless, robbing in broad daylight. Please uphold justice!"

The two law enforcers didn't move, just watched coldly.

The victim called out again, "Sirs, please help! I'm willing to give you half the contents of my Spatial Ring as payment!"

One of the law enforcers sneered, "Only half?"

The victim gritted his teeth and said bitterly, "All of it—it's yours."

He knew that if he didn't get help, he'd be killed by these lawless people. Compared to his life, the rest meant nothing.

Only then did the two law enforcers lazily step forward. The one who spoke before snorted, "Since you know how to behave, we'll help you."

As soon as he finished, both moved at once, their attacks ruthless. Energy surged as they blasted the robbers away, leaving countless dead and wounded in midair. The air was instantly thick with the stench of blood.

With their intervention, the surrounding martial artists fell silent, and the surviving robbers scattered like frightened animals, not daring to linger.

Only the robbed martial artist remained, lying on the ground covered in blood, looking utterly miserable.

The law enforcers walked over, reached out, and drew the Spatial Ring into their hand. After checking it with Divine Sense, one frowned and spat, "Pathetic! Only this much?"

Then, still disgusted, he spat at the martial artist and swaggered off.

"He'll just have to wait to die now," Jiao Yi sighed.

That martial artist hadn't had much to begin with, and now, without his Spatial Ring, unless he quickly found a ship to go to sea, he'd end up like the robbers—sitting here waiting to die.

"It's so chaotic here," Yang Kai said grimly.

Ling Yinqin replied, "When people are desperate, they'll do anything. These people have been pushed too far."

Yang Kai was silent, knowing Ling Yinqin was right.

Those robbers were already waiting to die—what did they have left to fear? But what shocked Yang Kai was how filthy Tongtian City's law enforcers were.

That scene just now could be called taking advantage of someone's misfortune, demanding payment for help. But really, it was just robbery.

Clearly, Tongtian City was a place without law. It was impressive that Ling Yinqin and the others had managed to survive here so long.

"This is the outer city. It's more chaotic. The inner city is safer—things like this don't happen there," Ling Yinqin explained.

"Do you live in the outer city or the inner city?" Yang Kai asked.

Jiao Yi replied, "Outer city, but in a few days we'll be able to move to the inner city."

They'd gained enough this time to rent a good cave dwelling in the inner city. Though living costs were higher there, it was much safer, so the expense was worth it.

Ling Yinqin said, "Senior Brother Yang, since you've just arrived, it's best to rent a cave dwelling and settle in. Get to know the place."

"That's exactly what I was thinking," Yang Kai nodded. He didn't know how long he'd be staying on Tongtian Island, but he needed a place to settle down.
