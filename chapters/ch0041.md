## Chapter 41 — Body Tempering Realm, Eighth Stage

“I wonder… are you just as formidable elsewhere?” Hu Mei’er’s sharp, watery eyes held a deeper meaning as she looked at Yang Kai, her words brazenly provocative.

Such blatant seduction would stir any man’s heart. Moreover, Hu Mei’er was no plain woman; her figure was alluring, and many had long coveted her.

A series of swallowing sounds echoed from all directions. Su Mu and the others were already weak from the fight, and this sudden stimulus stirred their blood, causing several to straighten up sharply before fainting on the spot.

Yang Kai felt a surge of wicked fire rise within him; his Adam’s apple bobbed involuntarily, and his breathing grew heavy. The large hand gripping Hu Mei’er’s slender neck tightened without his control.

Hu Mei’er gasped softly, twisting her body slightly, shooting Yang Kai a reproachful glare. “Still not letting go?”

As she spoke, she reached out a hand and gently pried open Yang Kai’s grip. Whether intentional or not, she placed his hand on her round, full bosom.

The astonishing elasticity and warmth radiated through his palm. Yang Kai clearly felt a small protrusion pressing into his hand. The sensation was so intense that the blood oozing from his wound seemed to flow faster.

His face flushed. He had never imagined this woman could be so wanton. How young she was, yet truly, ambition knows no age; allure belongs to the present.

Seeing Yang Kai’s embarrassed state, Hu Mei’er chuckled softly, her breath fragrant as orchids. “What do you want to do?”

Yang Kai looked down at Hu Mei’er beneath him, feeling like a dog biting a porcupine — nowhere to sink his teeth. Throughout the battle, this Hu Mei’er had never laid a hand on any Lingxiao Pavilion disciple, so naturally, Yang Kai could not strike her. His intention to teach her a lesson was because she had been stirring up trouble from the sidelines.

Yet, being toyed with like this, Yang Kai felt a surge of indignation. After all, he was a man; how could he be toyed with so easily?

After a moment’s thought, the large hand resting on Hu Mei’er’s chest suddenly clenched tightly.

“Ah…” Hu Mei’er’s expression shifted, a moan escaping her lips. Her delicate face flushed deeply, and she glared at Yang Kai with mock anger, surprised at his lack of tenderness.

Amid laughter, Yang Kai stood up and looked at Hu Mei’er. “You may leave.”

Hu Mei’er froze, staring blankly at Yang Kai, utterly unprepared for her usually irresistible seduction to fail. So many eyes had long coveted her body, eager to taste its sweetness. Many young men had fought over her before, but today, she had taken the rare step of initiating with a man—and yet, she was ignored.

Is he even a man?

After a moment’s daze, Hu Mei’er suddenly smiled radiantly. With graceful poise, she rose from the ground, gazing deeply at Yang Kai. Biting her red lips, she leaned close to his ear and whispered, “You are very interesting.”

With a soft giggle, she turned and left, her slender waist and full hips swaying with irresistible charm.

Su Mu and the others were dumbfounded, eyes filled with envy, jealousy, and resentment. They never expected Yang Kai to refuse such an opportunity. Each silently asked themselves: if Hu Mei’er had said those words to me, what would I have done?

Most likely, I would have gone for it! No, absolutely! A gift from the heavens—why refuse? There’s no loss in accepting.

After Hu Mei’er departed, the group turned back to Yang Kai, each feeling a mix of sorrow and shame.

Sighs arose all around.

Yang Kai crouched down, tearing strips of cloth from the fallen disciples at Fengyu Tower, then wrapped his injured palm.

Looking at Su Mu and the others, their faces were sheepish.

“Do you still have the strength to walk?” Yang Kai asked.

They all nodded slightly.

“Then let’s go.”

The group, bruised and battered, returned to Lingxiao Pavilion, dispersing to seek medicine and heal their wounds. Though a fight had occurred today, it was merely a skirmish among juniors. Such clashes were common among the three great factions nearby, so no one made a fuss.

As long as no important figures died, the elders of each faction turned a blind eye. Conflict bred progress; the elders hoped to use such battles to temper their disciples.

Back at his small wooden hut, Yang Kai had intended to use the remaining half bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment, but reconsidered.

His most severe injury was the palm pierced by a long sword; the rest were minor. Though the wound looked gruesome, it was not as serious as it seemed. When grabbing Shaofeng’s sword, Yang Kai had avoided bones and meridians. The hole in his palm was only skin and flesh damage.

It was similar to the injury from the last battle with the spider; that had healed in three or four days, so this would be the same.

Moreover, in just a short while, his wound had already improved, and his strength partially restored. Yang Kai carefully sensed within himself and realized that the warmth radiating from his Proud Bone Golden Body aided healing, while his True Yang Yuan Qi also possessed some curative power. Together, they accelerated his recovery.

Realizing True Yang Yuan Qi’s healing effect, Yang Kai hurried to Dragon Confinement Ravine to absorb Yang energy. Though he had not used a drop of Yang Liquid in today’s battle, his True Yang Yuan Qi had been heavily depleted and needed replenishment.

As he absorbed the Yang energy, a sudden surge stirred within him. The external Yang energy flooded in uncontrollably, accomplishing in an instant what usually took one or two days. Not only was his True Yang Yuan Qi fully restored, but it also grew stronger. His meridians felt sturdier and more expansive in that moment.

Body Tempering Realm, Eighth Stage? Yang Kai came to his senses, a smile spreading across his face.

To break through to the eighth stage so quickly was not unexpected. He had estimated it would take at least seven or eight more days.

This breakthrough was clearly tied to the all-out battle today. Fighting others truly had its benefits.

With joy in his heart, Yang Kai trained the True Yang Technique with greater effort. After breaking through a stage, his absorption of Yang energy accelerated noticeably, and all aspects improved.

That night, Yang Kai returned to his hut to rest. Having been injured, it was unwise to stay up late training.

In the following days, Yang Kai spent all his time either eating, sleeping, or cultivating at Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Su Mu and the others did not appear; they were likely still recovering.

Several days later, at dawn, Yang Kai was sweeping the floor when he saw Su Mu leading Li Yuntian and the others approaching from afar. Everyone who had fought that day was present, marching behind Su Mu with heads held high.

Though they had healed for several days, the group still looked pitiful—bruised eyes and swollen lips made for a comical sight.

Yang Kai glanced at them and laughed, “Junior Brother Su, itching for a fight again?”
