## Chapter 997 — I've Got You

Inside the Purple Star warship, Yang Kai poured out his Saint Yuan without mercy; he had no idea how many Vast Heaven Shields he had condensed, but it could not have been fewer than a hundred.

The Yang Liquid stored in his Dantian was also consumed in that instant, more than twenty drops gone.

Then he unleashed the Demon God Transformation; corrupt energy filled his body and invisible Demon Marks hid beneath his flesh, increasing the power of his Qi and blood and strengthening his body's defenses.

He had done everything he could; now he could only leave the rest to fate.

The cataclysmic impact tore through his ears, nearly ripping his eardrums, and he felt the warship shudder violently—this Saint King-grade Upper-Level warship disintegrated in an instant, ripped apart.

Agonized cries rose one after another as once-vigorous life forces were extinguished; at the moment of impact, Purple Star’s cultivators suffered countless deaths and injuries.

Yang Kai felt like a lone boat on a storm-tossed sea, constantly at risk of being capsized and destroyed.

The Vast Heaven Shields protecting him shattered one after another, the hopeless sounds of cracking filling the air; over a hundred Vast Heaven Shields vanished within the space of two breaths.

Then he saw the map master Wusuo, driven by inertia, fly toward him and explode into a spray of blood and mist—no bones remained.

Immediately, a dense series of crisp snaps ran through his whole body, as if every bone were being crushed to powder.

Whoosh—whoosh—whoosh...

Fragments of the ship shot out like lightning in all directions; a colossal airwave swept through with world-destroying force. Yang Kai only felt himself struck hard by something, and then he lost consciousness.

In the Chaos Abyss, two Saint King-grade Upper-Level warships collided and both were reduced to fragments; the debris and the Sword Alliance's and Purple Star's cultivators were all swallowed by the great black hole, leaving no trace.

Long afterward, the chaotic domain field in the Chaos Abyss gradually calmed, and as the field settled the great black hole torn open in the Starry Sky slowly contracted and disappeared.

Eventually the Chaos Abyss returned to peace; no one would have imagined that not long before two warships had clashed here and warriors had fought to the death.

......

Yang Kai woke up slowly; the moment he opened his eyes he saw a seven-colored, misty sky—so beautiful it seemed not of this world.

He tried to roll his eyes but could not sense his body; numbness pervaded him and he felt nothing.

He began moving his limbs to get his blood flowing faster, hoping to relieve the numbness.

Gradually pain spread through every part of him, as if mountains had struck from all sides, pain twisting his face into a grimace.

He suddenly recalled everything that had happened before he lost consciousness and began to breathe heavily, grateful to have survived.

Only then did he realize he seemed weightless, falling downward at tremendous speed.

Struggling to marshal his strength and straighten his body, Yang Kai looked around left and right.

He saw warship fragments of various sizes, the bodies of cultivators—some still alive, some not—and countless severed limbs scattered around him, all falling downward together.

Below, there was a continent.

The continent was bizarre, seeming to float in midair with no visible support.

It covered a wide area; from several thousand zhang above, Yang Kai estimated it might be as large as the entire Great Han nation.

The scenery was beautiful and lush, filled with birdsong and the scent of flowers.

Where was this? Yang Kai frowned.

He knew nothing of the Star Domain, only having learned some information while chatting with Shen Tu in the power room recently.

But he knew this was definitely not any star within the Chaos Abyss.

He had seen those stars from afar before; none matched the continent below.

The Purple Star warship had been wrecked in the Chaos Abyss, collided with the Sword Alliance ship, and been swallowed by the giant black hole—so how had it arrived at this floating continent in the void?

That suggested the giant black hole might be a Void Passage with teleportation properties.

Yet this place bore no resemblance to the Small Xuan Realm; it felt more like a strange, self-contained space within the Chaos Abyss.

Apart from that island-like continent, all around was a seven-colored sky, and the air flowed with intense Heaven-and-Earth Energy that put one at ease.

It seemed the dense energies of the Chaos Abyss had all converged here.

Yang Kai thought this over as he continued to fall, and after a moment he realized his situation was not favorable.

If he could survive that annihilation, of course those Purple Star masters could as well.

While he was pondering, more people nearby began to regain consciousness, looking around in confusion; among them was the beautiful Bi Ya.

Yang Kai quietly concealed himself behind a piece of debris and began searching for Shen Tu.

To his regret he found nothing and had no idea whether Shen Tu had survived the disaster.

In the sky, many people rode arcs of rainbow light, rushing to rescue and awaken those companions who were still alive.

Others took advantage of unconscious enemies to strike them hard and force them into eternal sleep.

In some places small-scale battles had already broken out.

Purple Star and Sword Alliance people stranded in the same place naturally would not get along.

Yang Kai seized an opportunity and covertly slipped to the side, attempting to distance himself from this trouble.

No sooner had his figure been revealed than an exasperated feminine shout rang in his ear: "You little bastard, where are you running!"

The first thing Bi Ya did when she opened her eyes was look for Yang Kai's figure.

Because of Yang Kai, she had been chastised by Lü Guichen and struck by a Divine Sense attack that almost left her with a hidden wound; she hated Yang Kai deeply.

Whenever Yang Kai made a move, she would detect it.

As she spoke, her slender jade hand flicked out a Dragon Bone Whip—its quality obvious at a glance. Like a dragon emerging from a cave, a vague draconic form shimmered in midair; rows of unstoppable Wind Blades swirled around the dragon and thundered down toward Yang Kai's head.

Yang Kai had no desire to tangle with her; he struck back with a palm, the huge imprint meeting the Dragon Bone Whip. Using the rebound he quickly shot downwards.

A cold snort sounded nearby; Yang Kai's face changed and he turned to find Lü Guichen, a Saint King Realm expert, had appeared beside him without him realizing.

He looked at Yang Kai with remorseless coldness as if viewing an ant, then reached out a hand and nonchalantly grabbed at him.

His movements weren’t fast, yet Yang Kai found himself overwhelmed by a crushing sense of defeat just standing before him, as if a single strand of Divine Sense from the man could shatter his very mind.

Yang Kai was horrified.

In the next moment Lü Guichen had seized Yang Kai in his hand and asked coldly, "Where is Master Wusuo?"

Before the ship disaster, Yang Kai had been the closest to Master Wusuo; Lü Guichen had sought him out to ask about Wusuo—otherwise, given his status and strength, he would not have lowered himself like this.

"Dead."

Although he had suspected as much, Lü Guichen's expression dimmed when he heard Yang Kai's answer.

Now that the Purple Star cultivators were stranded here, their only hope was the map master, for only a map master understood the Star Domain well enough to possibly find a way out.

Losing interest in Yang Kai, Lü Guichen casually tossed him toward Bi Ya.

"If there are problems this time, finish him yourself!" he said coldly.

"Lord, rest assured—I'll drain his Essence-Blood dry and leave him no burial place!" Bi Ya ground her teeth, a crazed look passing over her beautiful face, venomous as a viper.

Saying this, her eyes glowered at Yang Kai with hatred as if she wanted to suck him dry into a husk.

Yang Kai's expression was bitter; he said nothing.

At this moment he could not use his strength; he did not know what Lü Guichen had done to him to prevent using it. He was only somewhat physically robust and was no match for the beautiful Bi Ya.

Only now did he clearly recognize the vast gap between the Saint King Realm and the First Stage of the Saint Realm, and this Lü Guichen was likely no ordinary Saint King—he must possess extremely high attainments to so easily subdue him.

Gripping Yang Kai, Bi Ya paid no heed to others and flew down, arriving on the continent shortly thereafter.

She took deep breaths of the continent's air, savoring the joy of survival and the shock of narrowly escaping death; her ample breasts rose and fell exaggeratedly, and her attire was outrageously revealing—her neckline thrown open to expose a broad swathe of tender white skin and an enticing cleavage.

"Shall we discuss what to do?" Yang Kai suddenly asked.

"Kid, don't waste your breath," Bi Ya said coldly. "In any case this time you have no escape—I’ve got you."

Yang Kai shrugged and gestured ahead. "The Sword Alliance people who survived have also come down; you two may have to fight later. I'll help you kill them—just don't lay a hand on me, how about that?"

"When have I ever laid a hand on you?" Bi Ya seemed a bit irate, giving him a disdainful glance. "Besides, you're only a First Stage of the Saint Realm—who could you possibly kill? Take a look at yourself."

“Ke Meng was killed by me,” Yang Kai said flatly.

Bi Ya pursed her lips and looked at him in some shock. "Ke Meng was too careless, wasn't he?"

She obviously assumed Ke Meng's death was due to carelessness rather than Yang Kai's ability.

"No matter what, I won't believe you. I never get fooled by men—you're the first!" Bi Ya sneered. "So once things calm down, I'll take good care of you; you won't be disappointed!"

She spat the words, clearly holding a grudge.

Yang Kai shook his head, stopped wasting words, and began to examine his own condition.
