## Chapter 2219 — Soul Jade

Inside the cave, agonized wails echoed continuously, occasionally mixed with the sound of a massive creature slamming into the cave walls, producing dull thuds. Within, shattered stones rained down in a torrent.

"What a brutal scene," Yang Kai sighed.

The Purple Civet nodded in agreement at his side.

After a moment, the commotion from within the cave gradually faded and finally disappeared.

The Soul-Devouring Worms had clearly dealt with the Demonic Beast inside the cave!

In this world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, any prey targeted by the Soul-Devouring Worm never met a good end.

After confirming there was no danger, Yang Kai finally strode forward and entered the cave.

The cave was dimly lit, but this did not hinder Yang Kai's vision. After all, he was a Spirit Body. With a sweep of his Divine Sense, everything inside the cave was imprinted in his mind.

The cave was neither deep nor spacious. It was a scene of utter chaos, with traces everywhere of a desperate struggle. The cave's owner had clearly suffered greatly at the hands of the Soul-Devouring Worms and had thrashed about fiercely before dying.

Yang Kai didn't even know what kind of Demonic Beast had been here, because by the time he arrived, the Soul-Devouring Worms had already devoured it completely, leaving no trace behind.

In his current state, he could no longer absorb Divine Soul Origin, so he hadn't let the Soul-Devouring Worms leave anything behind.

After retrieving the Soul-Devouring Worms, Yang Kai began to examine everything inside the cave.

Yet, after sweeping with his Divine Sense, he found nothing at all!

There were no spirit fruits or other treasures in this cave at all. It seemed to be merely a place for a Demonic Beast to rest and recuperate.

This discovery left Yang Kai a bit disappointed, but he didn't dwell on it.

After all, not every powerful Demonic Beast guarded a treasure…

Just as he was about to turn and leave, he suddenly paused, his gaze locking onto a certain spot in the cave.

Over there, something strange caught his attention.

After observing for a moment, Yang Kai walked over, bent down, and picked the object up from the ground.

The instant it touched his hand, Yang Kai's body suddenly trembled, his eyes flashing with brilliance as he drew a sharp breath.

His unusual reaction startled Purple Civet, who bristled and darted away from Yang Kai as if fleeing.

"This is…" Yang Kai muttered as he examined the object in his hand, releasing his Divine Sense to probe it.

He quickly realized what it was.

It was a disc-shaped item, about the size of a millstone, pure white as jade, flawless and immaculate.

When Yang Kai had swept it with his Divine Sense earlier, he hadn't noticed anything special, only that its shape was rather peculiar. That was why he had paid extra attention and picked it up for a closer look.

Unexpectedly, the moment he touched it, his soul resonated inexplicably with the white jade disc, causing his entire Spirit Body to tremble slightly.

At the same time, a stream of pure, untainted soul energy flowed from the white jade disc into Yang Kai's body, making him feel as if he were soaking in warm water—utterly comfortable.

The sensation made his whole body relax, an indescribable comfort that he couldn't get enough of. He felt as if he might float away…

To describe it more specifically, it was just like the feeling he had back when his soul had merged with Su Yan's.

"Soul Jade!"

Countless stray thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning, and Yang Kai cried out in shock.

Although he had never seen a Soul Jade before, didn't know what it looked like, and had only heard of it from Gao Xueting a few days ago, at this moment, he was one hundred percent certain that the thing in his hand was exactly the Soul Jade Gao Xueting had described.

According to Gao Xueting, even in the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, Soul Jade was a treasure that could only be encountered by chance. She herself had entered this place four times, but so far had only ever obtained a single Middle-Level Soul Jade, and even that one piece had brought her tremendous benefit.

Yang Kai didn't know how Soul Jade was graded, but he felt that the one in his hand was definitely above Middle-Level—very likely Upper-Level, or even a Supreme Soul Jade!

Soul Jade was the purest soul energy condensed in the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror. It could be easily absorbed by cultivators to strengthen their Divine Sense, with no hidden dangers or side effects.

Yet, Gao Xueting had described it as so rare that Yang Kai never thought he'd be lucky enough to obtain one.

And yet, here he was, holding one in his hand!

"It's so big…" Yang Kai's mouth hung open in excitement, but then he frowned. "How long will it take to absorb all this?"

As he spoke, he was already trying to absorb the energy within the Soul Jade, wanting to see if it was as miraculous as Gao Xueting had said.

A thread of pure energy emerged from the Soul Jade, flowing through Yang Kai's arms into his body, instantly filling him with a warm sensation and making him unconsciously reveal an expression of pleasure.

As the energy poured in, Yang Kai found that, just as Gao Xueting had said, absorbing the Soul Jade's energy caused no harm to himself at all.

His Spirit Body was still in a saturated state, unable to absorb any more Divine Soul Origins left behind by dead Demonic Beasts.

But absorbing the Soul Jade's energy was completely unimpeded, as natural as water flowing downhill.

From the end of the Soul Jade, Yang Kai could clearly sense the terrifying, surging energy contained within it.

He couldn't help but have the thought: "Why not just stay here and absorb the Soul Jade's energy until the time limit runs out?"

If he really did that, Yang Kai estimated that by the time he left this place, the strength of his soul would be able to rival the Emperor Realm! Even then, he might not finish absorbing all the Soul Jade's energy, and he could let the Soul-Devouring Worms absorb some as well.

Ample time and abundant energy reserves would allow him to maximize his gains here!

But…

Just as this thought arose, another force within Yang Kai suddenly surged forth. In the dim cave, a burst of seven-colored radiance erupted, dazzlingly bright, painting the entire cave in a rainbow of colors.

The radiance flared and then withdrew. In a flash, Yang Kai suddenly felt his hand lighten.

The Soul Jade… was gone.

This sudden change caught Yang Kai completely off guard. Stunned, he hurriedly looked inward.

Very quickly, he found the Soul Jade's whereabouts somewhere inside his body.

At this moment, it was wrapped by the Warm Spirit Lotus, lying quietly at the heart of the lotus.

When Yang Kai looked, he couldn't help but notice an incredible sight. The Soul Jade was melting away like snow under the blazing sun, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

The surging energy released from the Soul Jade was completely absorbed by the Warm Spirit Lotus, not a drop remaining.

After absorbing the Soul Jade's energy, the Warm Spirit Lotus seemed to shine even more brightly.

At the same time, a gentle, continuous power radiated from within the Warm Spirit Lotus, slowly and steadily flowing into Yang Kai's Spirit Body…

"What is going on!" Yang Kai was completely dumbfounded, his mind a tangled mess.

He had just discovered an Upper-Level or even Supreme Soul Jade, only for it to be absorbed by the Warm Spirit Lotus, which then slowly fed the energy back into his Spirit Body.

Was this a good thing… or a bad thing?

Yang Kai couldn't figure it out.

Losing the Soul Jade was certainly a loss. But it hadn't been stolen by someone else—it had been absorbed by the Warm Spirit Lotus, which was now slowly returning the energy to his body…

After thinking it over, Yang Kai secretly felt that this probably wasn't a bad thing.

This way, both he and the Warm Spirit Lotus would benefit. Moreover, although the feedback was much slower, it would allow him to gradually adapt to his strengthening soul and maintain perfect control.

On the other hand, if he tried to absorb the Soul Jade's energy himself, he might not finish in the remaining days, and he certainly wouldn't be able to do anything else.

But now, he no longer needed to worry about the Soul Jade and could do whatever he needed to do.

"It's definitely a good thing!" Yang Kai declared with certainty.

After speaking, he looked around and spotted Purple Civet staring at him in fear from a corner.

When the strange change had occurred, Purple Civet hadn't understood what was happening and had immediately distanced itself from Yang Kai. Now, seeing that he was unharmed and even beckoning to it kindly, it slowly ambled back over.

After confirming that Yang Kai was fine, it once again leaped onto his shoulder.

For some reason, though, it sniffed Yang Kai a few times, then looked confused, as if it thought his scent was somehow different from before.

Next, Yang Kai made another circuit of the cave, carefully checking to make sure he hadn't missed anything. Only then did he stroll outside at a leisurely pace.

With plenty of time left, he naturally wouldn't waste it.

He had just stepped out of the cave when he heard a whooshing sound from not far away.

Immediately after, a figure suddenly landed in front of him.

Startled, Yang Kai instinctively mobilized his soul power, summoned the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier, and lightly leapt back.

He had never expected to encounter someone else in this place.

The newcomer was clearly just as surprised. Upon seeing Yang Kai, they also mobilized their soul power, watching him warily.

Their eyes met, and the person frowned, scrutinizing the purple light barrier around Yang Kai with a puzzled expression.

Just as Yang Kai had expected, in this world, cultivators had no Secret Treasures to use! They lacked the materials to forge them.

Battles between cultivators here were contests of soul power, relying on soul secret arts and weapons condensed from soul energy!

Divine Soul Secret Treasures were exceedingly rare for cultivators in this world!

When the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier was summoned, it formed a purple light screen around Yang Kai. Although it looked similar to some defensive secret arts, it was fundamentally different.

The cultivator who had suddenly appeared was quite strong, at the level of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and immediately saw through the difference.
