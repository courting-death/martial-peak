## Chapter 2077 — No Way Out

But things were different with the people at the Spiritual Pill Shop and those pill masters.

Yang Kai had little rapport with them, and if the secret of the Xuan Realm Pearl leaked from their mouths, it would surely draw the covetous eyes of countless experts.

The Xuan Realm Pearl was an Imperial Treasure, capable of forming its own world and being carried on the person — across the entire Star Realm it was likely unique.

There were a few treasures in the Star Realm that formed their own domain, like the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda Yang Kai had entered last time; it was the Star God Palace’s palace treasure, and its interior likewise constituted an independent realm.

The biggest difference between the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda and the Xuan Realm Pearl was that the pagoda could not be carried about and had to be kept within the Star God Palace.

The matter of the Xuan Realm Pearl was weighty; Yang Kai would not expose it until absolutely necessary.

"It looks like a frontal breakout is impossible now," Yang Kai murmured. His expression shifted and he asked, "There should be a Space Array in Fenglin City, right?"

In his native Star Domain, even many large cities had teleport-capable Space Arrays, and all the more so in the vast Star Realm; Fenglin City was not large, but it ought to have a Space Array.

"There is one, but it’s at the City Lord’s Mansion!" Kang Siran nodded in reply.

"Then go — to the City Lord’s Mansion!" Yang Kai answered, immediately guiding the tower ship and speeding toward the mansion.

From above, Fenglin City was in chaos; after news that the pure Demonic Qi of an Ancient Great Demon had besieged the city spread, the resident martial artists panicked, fearing the city’s defensive arrays would fall and doom them.

The first idea that occurred to them was naturally to use the Space Array to teleport away!

So at that moment countless fighters surged toward the City Lord’s Mansion!

Realizing this, Yang Kai’s face darkened and he urged the tower ship on even faster.

Before long the tower ship arrived over the City Lord’s Mansion.

But even before he could control the ship to descend, a burst of energy belonging to a Dao Origin Realm expert erupted from one of the halls below with a tremendous roar. The hall collapsed in an instant, stones flying — the grand hall became ruins.

Many martial artists cursed as they flew out from the rubble, each with an enraged expression.

Yang Kai’s eyelids tightened; a bad premonition rose up. He turned to Kang Siran and said, "Brother Kang, that place… could it be where the teleport array is?"

Kang Siran nodded with difficulty.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he cast his gaze toward a shabby silhouette floating in midair.

The man was short and stout, his clothes tattered, with his hair in wild disarray — he looked no different from a beggar — yet he exuded the powerful aura only a Dao Origin Realm practitioner could muster, and a large green gourd hung at his waist.

Who else could it be but the Drunken Old Man?

Here and now he was the only Dao Origin Realm presence; it seemed the commotion had indeed been his doing.

Below, countless martial artists glared up at the Drunken Old Man with expressions full of hatred, as if they longed to kill him on the spot!

"Deputy City Lord, why did you destroy the teleport array? We respected you in peace, yet at this crucial moment your hand is so vicious!"

"Yes — Drunken Old Man, why would you cut off our retreat!"

"With the Space Array ruined, it’s over; we can’t escape now."

"Drunken Old Man, if you don’t give us an explanation today, don’t expect to leave here alive!"

"Drunken Old Man, we are irreconcilable with you!"

Shouts and accusations stabbed like the sharpest blades at the floating Drunken Old Man, and some, their emotions boiling over, already acted first — producing Secret Treasures and unleashing Martial Skills to strike at him.

The Drunken Old Man stood unmoved beneath a thousand accusations; he did not even flinch at the attacks, merely using Origin Qi to shield himself with no intention of fighting back.

"Everyone!" the Drunken Old Man swept his gaze around, his tone cold and low as he declared, "This old fellow understands your thoughts and knows what you think! But today Fenglin City is besieged by Demonic Qi from which it may fall at any moment!"

"You old wretch! If you knew this and still destroyed the Space Array, your motives are truly malicious — you deserve to be punished by death!" Angry shouts rose from the crowd.

The Drunken Old Man looked in that direction, apology plain on his face, and continued, "Precisely because of that I had no choice but to take this desperate measure. Fenglin City’s tens of thousands of martial artists, if united, might survive this disaster, but if everyone thinks only of fleeing via the Space Array, the city will be breached and the place will be slaughtered, a living hell!"

"I have lived in Fenglin City my whole life; I have relatives and friends here, and so do you. I do not want to see them tormented, bereft of reason. Do you wish to see that? If you only care about saving yourselves, then who will protect your families and friends?"

At these words the Drunken Old Man’s stern eyes swept the crowd.

The angry voices in the crowd grew quieter and many bowed their heads, deep in thought.

"Fenglin City is but a speck in the Star Realm, little known even in the Southern Territory; yet the sons of Fenglin possess a proud backbone. I have witnessed hundreds of years of this city’s history, I like this place and do not want to see it fall!"

"Rest assured, messengers have been sent through the Space Array to other cities to relay this information to major sects like the Star God Palace — I believe reinforcements from powerful experts will arrive soon to relieve Fenglin City!"

"But until then, I beg you to stand with me and guard the city against the enemy. I promise here to do my utmost to protect the city and you all; even if my blood runs out, I will have no regrets!"

"Please, lend me your strength!"

With that the Drunken Old Man swept his gaze about, sincerity plain in his eyes.

The scene fell silent; the earlier clamor and chaos had vanished.

“Count this City Lord in as well. Here and now, this City Lord swears a Heart-Demon Oath: so long as the city stands, I stand; if the city falls, I perish.” Duan Yuanshan’s voice suddenly carried from afar, and a moment later his figure flickered into view beside the Drunken Old Man.

The Drunken Old Man paused, then grinned at Duan Yuanshan.

"Old Drunk, your intentions are sound," Duan Yuanshan transmitted quietly, gratitude clear on his face.

The Drunken Old Man slowly shook his head.

At that moment someone in the crowd unexpectedly shouted, "Follow the City Lord and Deputy City Lord’s lead! City lives, we live! City falls, we die!”

“City lives, we live! City falls, we die!”

“City lives, we live! City falls, we die!”

More and more martial artists joined the chant until the thunderous sound swelled into a world-shaking roar, spreading in all directions and up to the Nine Heavens.

United!

All as one!

The Drunken Old Man looked down with deep satisfaction and bowed deeply.

Whether those below truly supported him or acted out of necessity, anyone willing to contribute to defending Fenglin City would earn his gratitude.

"Thank you all. We have no way back now; if we want to live we must resist the Demonic Qi. Please head to the city walls and support our fellows!" the Drunken Old Man called aloud.

At his order the crowd surged; people took to the air or produced flying Secret Treasures and scattered to their assigned positions.

"Old Drunk, I leave this place to you; I’ll go deal with someone," Duan Yuanshan said, then looked at the nearby tower ship and, with a movement, came before it, cupped his fist and said, "Brother Yang, may I see you?"

"Lord Duan, come aboard for a word," Yang Kai’s voice came from within the tower ship.

Hearing this, Duan Yuanshan smiled faintly and stepped onto the ship.

Inside the cabin Duan Yuanshan found Yang Kai’s expression indifferent.

"Brother Yang!" Duan Yuanshan cupped his fist again, face stern as he said, "I have come uninvited to ask after the information regarding that Ancient Demonic Qi!"

"I know," Yang Kai nodded and, without concealing anything, simply recounted what had occurred in the mine.

Duan Yuanshan’s brow knit deeply; in a low voice he said, "So according to you, Brother Yang, this matter was caused by the Jiang Family?"

"Yes," Yang Kai affirmed.

"No wonder I did not see that old Jiang Taisheng!" Duan Yuanshan said angrily, then asked, "Since you had direct contact with that Ancient Demonic Qi, do you know any way to combat it?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "I do not know much; only that once that Demonic Qi corrupts the body, it changes a person’s temperament, and… the recently dead infected by it can be revived."

"How can that be?" Duan Yuanshan’s face altered.

"I do not know; perhaps there is something miraculous within that Ancient Demonic Qi."

Mo Xiaoqi suddenly interjected, "In truth there is no special method to counter Ancient Demonic Qi — you must strike it down with overwhelming force. Ordinary Demonic Qi has countermeasures, but the pure Demonic Qi of an Ancient Great Demon is extremely difficult to restrain. However…"

"However what?" Duan Yuanshan immediately turned to Mo Xiaoqi, his expression querying.

"Since the mine was sealed with Qingxin Jade, it should slightly resist the Demonic Qi’s invasion. If the city’s fighters could wear some Qingxin Jade, it might have a certain effect."

"Qingxin Jade?" Duan Yuanshan raised a brow, troubled. "These are rare; the City Lord’s storehouse has some, but very little!"

Mo Xiaoqi smiled faintly, produced several rings from her hand and handed them to Duan Yuanshan, saying, "City Lord, take a look at these."

Duan Yuanshan hesitated, then inspected them with Divine Sense; his face lit with joy. "So much Qingxin Jade?"
