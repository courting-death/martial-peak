## Chapter 257 — The Marvelous Use of Warm Spirit Lotus

The cries of the Earth Demon echoed continuously, rising and falling, filled with panic and fear.

“Earth Demon!” Yang Kai gritted his teeth against the pain in his head and shouted, “What’s wrong with you?”

“Master…” The voice of the Earth Demon trembled slightly, “What kind of place is this? Why is my soul being attacked?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai suddenly realized! No wonder the pain in his head felt so familiar; it was the sensation of a wounded soul.

For the past few days, Yang Kai had been using this method to torment and intimidate Zi Mo and Leng Shan, yet today he found himself suffering the same agony.

This truly was a case of good begetting good and evil begetting evil; it was not that retribution was absent, but rather that the time had not yet come.

Chi Xue had led him into this jungle shrouded in white mist, clearly with ill intent, yet now he was also screaming in pain several dozen zhang away, seemingly unaware of the secrets of this place, having stumbled in and unable to endure the consequences.

Now both of them were suffering the torment of a wounded soul, completely unable to continue fighting.

“Master, quickly leave this place! This white mist is strange… it doesn’t harm the body, only the soul. I can’t take it anymore!” the Earth Demon urged anxiously.

Though he was an ancient demon, he was currently just a soul entity without a physical body. Usually, he hid comfortably within the Soul-Breaking Spike, but now that he had fallen into this place, he immediately encountered his nemesis. The torment and pain he suffered were far greater than those of Yang Kai and Chi Xue.

In this brief moment, the Earth Demon clearly felt his soul power weaken slightly, and this discovery left him in a state of panic, as if he had lost his mother.

“Alright, bear with it!” Yang Kai strained to look up, glancing at Chi Xue, who was also recklessly charging through the white mist, trying to find a way out, yet always at a loss.

Clenching his teeth and enduring the piercing pain, Yang Kai hurriedly retreated in the direction he had come.

After retreating over a hundred zhang, the surroundings were still obscured by white mist.

Yang Kai’s heart sank. He immediately sensed that something was amiss.

He had only penetrated a few zhang into this white mist, so why could he not exit? Unwilling to give up, he retreated another hundred zhang, yet it remained the same!

“Earth Demon… this place is very strange, I can’t get out!” Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically.

The Earth Demon gasped in despair, “Could it be that this old servant… is going to perish here today? I am unwilling!”

He had been sealed in the Inheritance Celestial Cave for countless years, only to be freed when the restrictions of the cave were broken. Although he had been subdued by Yang Kai, at least he had managed to escape. Now, facing another life-and-death crisis, the Earth Demon naturally felt a surge of resentment.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, struggling against the intense pain in his mind while observing the terrain and pondering ways to escape.

There must be some kind of restriction set up here, which was why it was so bizarre. The Earth Demon was currently of no help, and Yang Kai himself could not find the source of the restriction; how could he possibly break it?

“I feel a bit dizzy…” Yang Kai suddenly saw stars before his eyes, his steps faltering.

“It’s over, this is dangerous! This is a sign of soul damage; if it continues, Master, you might face soul annihilation!”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. He forced himself to endure the discomfort, his mind racing.

Suddenly, a glimmer of hope appeared in his mind. “Earth Demon, try entering my Golden Body!”

“What Golden Body? Oh…” The Earth Demon initially did not understand, but then he suddenly realized and hurriedly hid within Yang Kai’s Proud Bone Golden Body.

Moments later, the Earth Demon’s laughter echoed back, “Hahaha… Master, your Golden Body is indeed remarkable; it can resist the attack of that white mist. I am safe now!”

Yang Kai could only smile bitterly, “You’re safe, but I’m in danger!”

The Proud Bone Golden Body was all-encompassing, capable of absorbing any kind of energy. Although Yang Kai did not know what exactly was in the white mist, since it could attack the soul, it must also be a form of energy. Thus, he had the sudden idea to let the Earth Demon try it, and it proved to be effective.

“Master, you must hold on!” the Earth Demon urged anxiously for Yang Kai. Although he was currently free from worries, if Yang Kai were to die, he would not escape misfortune either.

“Is there any way for my soul to also enter the Golden Body?” Yang Kai’s forehead was bulging with veins, his clothes soaked with sweat, his fists clenched, and his body trembling.

“You haven’t reached the Divine Roaming Realm…” The Earth Demon sighed. Without reaching the Divine Roaming Realm and cultivating Divine Sense, how could one transfer their soul into the Golden Body?

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, doing his utmost to resist the pain from his mind, his Primordial Qi becoming uncontrollably chaotic.

The pain persisted for a long time, and that feeling of dizziness struck again. Yang Kai staggered and fell to the ground, his soul suffering damage for the second time!

At this rate, it wouldn’t be long before his soul truly faced annihilation and ceased to exist. He had to find a way to resolve this dire situation.

Although the situation was dire, Yang Kai became even calmer amidst adversity. Seizing this brief moment of dizziness, before the pain struck again, he gathered all his will and spirit, contemplating a way to escape.

As Yang Kai focused intently, he suddenly felt a cool sensation in his mind; this was not an illusion, but a genuine feeling.

As this cool sensation spread, his consciousness instantly cleared, and he felt a warmth enveloping him. The pain in his mind dissipated, as if he had received a divine revelation, refreshing and invigorating, even bringing some color back to his pale complexion.

“Hmm?” Yang Kai’s face showed a hint of confusion as he slowly rose, incredulously sensing the changes within him, frowning.

“Master?” the Earth Demon called softly.

Yang Kai did not respond, still immersed in his sensations. After a moment, accompanied by a short muffled groan, the intense pain struck again, an unbearable agony.

This pain lasted for a while, and once it reached a certain degree, the familiar dizziness returned.

At the same time, the coolness in his mind spread, not only driving away the dizziness but also erasing the pain.

It was exactly the same as before.

This time, Yang Kai observed more carefully and finally grasped a key point.

The pain was the white mist attacking his soul, while the dizziness was a result of the soul being injured. However, after experiencing this several times, Yang Kai not only did not feel his soul being damaged, but rather sensed a slight enhancement, as if his perception had expanded a little. This was the most significant sign of strengthening soul power.

Although the increase was not much, it was indeed an increase.

Yang Kai was overjoyed.

“Earth Demon, this time I fear I have gained fortune from misfortune!” Yang Kai suddenly burst into laughter. Before his laughter faded, he could not help but let out a muffled groan, clutching his head, his whole body convulsing.

After a long while, when Yang Kai returned to normal, the Earth Demon finally asked, “What happened?”

“The Warm Spirit Lotus is taking effect!” Yang Kai replied with a bitter smile, “It is repairing my damaged soul!”

The Earth Demon was taken aback, then suddenly enlightened.

This old demon had just been flustered and disoriented, not having thought of this point at all. Now that Yang Kai reminded him, he finally understood.

Back when they were on Hidden Island, Yang Kai had obtained a Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus, which was a supreme treasure for nourishing the soul. However, since Yang Kai had not yet reached the Divine Roaming Realm, the Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus had remained elusive in his mind.

Now that Yang Kai had fallen into this perilous place and suffered soul damage, the Warm Spirit Lotus would naturally come into play.

With this treasure, what was there to fear from the surrounding white mist?

The white mist and the Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus were in a state of mutual damage and repair, and during this process, Yang Kai’s soul was slowly growing.

However, this process was quite painful, something that ordinary people could not endure.

“Master, you are blessed by the heavens; good fortune is shining upon you. I knew you would be fine,” the Earth Demon exclaimed after the fact.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, deciding not to worry anymore. Instead, he sat cross-legged, allowing the white mist to envelop him, remaining steadfast.

Although this place was perilous, it was also an excellent location for tempering the soul. If he missed this opportunity, who knew when he would find such a treasure again?

Thus, Yang Kai resolved to stay here for a while longer. Although each time the Warm Spirit Lotus repaired his soul brought only a minuscule enhancement, gathering sand into a tower; as long as there was enough time, perhaps he could cultivate a sea of Divine Sense.

Wave after wave of pain surged fiercely, yet with his strong willpower, Yang Kai endured each time. After the pain came dizziness, and while dizzy, the Warm Spirit Lotus was also repairing his soul. The process was slow, but Yang Kai was content.

This was indeed a matter that consumed a considerable amount of time.

Half a day later, a piercing scream suddenly reached Yang Kai’s ears. He opened his eyes abruptly and looked in the direction of the sound, only to see Chi Xue, Zi Mo’s senior brother, flailing about like a headless fly in the white mist, looking disheveled and his expression twisted with rage, crashing into things while frantically unleashing True Essence, attacking wildly in all directions.

This person clearly did not have the good fortune that Yang Kai did, having the Warm Spirit Lotus by his side, so he had no need to worry about soul damage.

At this moment, he had already lost his sanity; even if he could escape this white mist, he would be completely deranged.

Yang Kai slowly rose, casting a cold gaze at him. After pondering for a moment, he could not help but approach him.

Even ignored, he would meet certain death, but he was a True Essence Realm Seventh Stage expert, and the blood beads formed upon his death would undoubtedly be extraordinary.

Chi Xue had led Yang Kai into this white mist with the intention of taking a risk, but unfortunately, things did not go as planned, and he was digging his own grave. If he had known this white mist was so dangerous, he would never have foolishly rushed in.

With three steps taken as two, Yang Kai arrived before him, swinging his fist. Chi Xue did not dodge but instinctively raised a palm to meet it.

Yang Kai sidestepped, and the Triple Flame Yang Explosion struck him, accompanied by several muffled thuds as Chi Xue was sent flying.

The battle was devoid of suspense; Chi Xue had lost his wits, and despite being a True Essence Realm Seventh Stage expert, he could not unleash his full strength. In less than thirty breaths, he was killed by Yang Kai.

After collecting the blood bead formed from his death, Yang Kai sat down and continued to cultivate his soul.
