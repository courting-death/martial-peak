## Chapter 2452 — It Was Him

The noisy discussions coming from all directions made Lan He’s face flush red, though it was unclear whether it was from anger or something else.

Although she was usually straightforward and her appearance was rather androgynous, she was still a woman. To have such things said about her to her face naturally left her both embarrassed and furious. Even with her strong temperament and cultivation, she was thrown into disarray.

The two martial artists besieging her were delighted to see this and attacked even more viciously.

Lan He was quite strong. Even though the two of them had the absolute upper hand, they would still have to pay a price to take her down. But now that her state of mind was disturbed, defeat was inevitable, and it was only a matter of time before she was killed.

Just then, someone else burst out laughing, “Who in the entire Eastern Territory hasn’t heard of Senior Brother Lan He of Heavenly Wolf Valley? Oh, sorry, I misspoke—Senior Sister, hahaha!”

The voice sounded familiar to Yang Kai. He turned his head and immediately saw the Brahma Heaven Sacred Land’s Holy Sons, Chang Hao and Chang Xian.

The one speaking was none other than Chang Hao, who had previously exchanged blows with Yang Kai.

Judging by his words, he clearly knew Lan He, but they didn’t seem to be on good terms. In fact, there was some bad blood, which was why he was kicking her while she was down.

“Heavenly Wolf Valley?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows. He felt like he’d heard of this force somewhere before, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t recall it.

“So is she a man or a woman? Hurry up and let us see for ourselves!” someone jeered, and the crowd immediately echoed the call.

“Shut up, all of you!” Yang Kai swept a cold gaze around and sneered, “A bunch of grown men, do you really find it so amusing to watch a woman being bullied?”

The heckler immediately snapped, “Who the hell do you think you are, kid? You were so arrogant just now, and now you’re still acting like you own the place. Do you dare to give your name?!”

The others also glared at Yang Kai, extremely displeased with his arrogance.

Yang Kai snorted coldly and ignored the man. Instead, he strode forward toward Lan He. While still midair, his ten fingers flickered, sending out over a hundred Golden Blood Threads.

In an instant, golden light burst forth. The Golden Blood Threads twisted and sliced through the air, producing a series of sharp, whistling sounds.

Although the two attacking Lan He never relaxed their assault, they were also wary of Yang Kai’s movements, since he seemed to have some connection with her.

So as soon as Yang Kai moved, the two immediately reacted.

One of them slashed at Yang Kai with his blade, shouting, “You’re courting death, brat!”

The strike was dazzling, as if it could shatter the very sky. The ferocious blade light made even heaven and earth pale, and the onlookers’ faces changed color.

The Golden Blood Threads twisted and shifted, suddenly forming a massive golden net that seemed to envelop the world, directly trapping the blade light within.

The hissing sound was endless. Though the blade light was powerful, it couldn’t break through the Golden Blood Threads’ defense and was instantly suppressed. The golden net, relentless, swept toward the martial artist and suddenly contracted, as if to wrap him up completely.

The martial artist’s face changed dramatically. He didn’t know what was strange about the golden net, but the terrifying power radiating from it was no illusion. There was no way he would let it touch him so easily, so he quickly retreated in a flash.

But in the next moment, his eyes suddenly widened in shock, as if he’d seen a ghost in broad daylight.

Because Yang Kai, who had been dozens of zhang away, had somehow appeared right in front of him like a specter, grinning with a chilling gleam in his white teeth. The sight made the man’s limbs go cold and his whole body shiver.

He had no idea how Yang Kai had gotten so close. It was as if, in the blink of an eye, their faces were nearly touching.

Their eyes met, and the martial artist saw a pure white lotus bud reflected in Yang Kai’s left eye. The bud was spotless and flawless, and it vanished in a flash.

In the next instant, his Sea of Consciousness was violently shaken, leaving him dizzy and barely able to stand.

Yang Kai struck out with a punch, his fist exploding with force.

Crack—

A sickening crack rang out as ribs shattered, and blood sprayed through the air.

The martial artist stood there in a daze, eyes wide, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief.

All around, people gasped in shock.

Everyone had seen Yang Kai rush up to his opponent, but no one knew what secret technique he’d used. His opponent’s face twisted in pain, and with Yang Kai’s punch, a massive hole was blasted through the man’s chest, Yang Kai’s arm piercing straight through.

The people standing behind the martial artist couldn’t help but twitch.

At that moment, Yang Kai’s hand was still gripping a freshly torn, violently beating heart—so bloody and raw that no one dared look directly at it.

With a slight squeeze, the heart burst apart. As the sound rang out, the martial artist whose chest had been pierced tilted his head and died instantly.

“Gulp…”

The sound of swallowing echoed all around. Many people now looked at Yang Kai differently. Even the strongest and most self-assured among them grew serious.

To kill an opponent of the same level in the blink of an eye, and without even seeming to use his full strength—few present could manage such a feat.

Even if they could, it would require a powerful secret technique that consumed a great deal of energy.

But looking at Yang Kai, it seemed he had simply summoned a golden net and thrown a punch, as easily as slaughtering chickens and dogs.

Only now did everyone realize that Yang Kai’s arrogance and disregard for others came from real strength.

“It was him…” Chang Hao’s eyes narrowed as he stared intently at Yang Kai, as if he’d made a discovery.

“Who?” Chang Xian asked in a low voice.

Chang Hao replied grimly, “If I’m not mistaken, this guy is the one who was with Yu Ying before.”

Chang Xian was shocked. “How is that possible? Didn’t you injure him with a single move? How could he be this strong? Besides, the two of them don’t even look alike.” He looked completely unconvinced.

Chang Hao said, “Looks can change, but a person’s aura can’t. The moment he made a move, I recognized him. This kid hid his strength well. He was definitely holding back before. But now that he’s here, where’s Yu Ying?”

Chang Xian said with a grim expression, “That brat struck with such ruthless ferocity—by the looks of it, Yu Ying’s chances are slim.”

Chang Hao said anxiously, “I clashed with that brat before—I don’t know whether he bears a grudge. If he turns on me…” As he spoke, his face grew slightly pale. As the Holy Son of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land, he had never truly feared anyone among those of the Dao Origin Realm, but after seeing how decisively and ruthlessly Yang Kai struck, he couldn’t help feeling a trace of unease.

Chang Xian’s expression changed. “If Yu Ying really died at his hands, we could pass the word to the Netherworld Sect. Yin Lesheng isn’t easy to deal with either.”

Chang Hao’s eyes lit up at that and he nodded. “Good idea.”

While the two were secretly discussing, the battle on Lan He’s side also came to an end.

Lan He might not have looked impressive, but her strength was real. Earlier, she’d been at a disadvantage while being besieged, but now that Yang Kai had killed one of her opponents in a flash, the remaining attacker was thrown into a panic and lost his composure. Lan He seized the opportunity to counterattack and finished him off in just a few moves.

Two beams of Star Seal light shot into the air. Yang Kai and Lan He each collected one, and they quickly split the two men’s Spatial Rings as well.

Having survived the ordeal, Lan He glanced gratefully at Yang Kai.

No matter why Yang Kai had intervened, he had saved her life. If he hadn’t stepped in, she would have died sooner or later—at best, dragging one down with her.

“Who was it just now that asked who I am?” Yang Kai swept his gaze around arrogantly and shouted, “Come on, step forward and I’ll tell you!”

The man who had spoken earlier didn’t dare step out, already hiding at the back of the crowd, his eyes darting nervously.

“Friend, it’s best to keep a low profile,” Chang Hao suddenly sneered, looking at Yang Kai. “Or do you think you’re invincible and don’t need to care about anyone here?”

With that, he dragged everyone present into the matter, causing many to glare at Yang Kai in displeasure.

Although Chang Hao was clearly trying to sow discord, Yang Kai’s attitude really was too much.

“So what if I don’t care? Bite me if you can!” Yang Kai shot Chang Hao a cold look, not understanding why he was jumping out to take the lead now.

Chang Hao snorted coldly, but didn’t get angry. He just smiled at Yang Kai, his eyes full of coldness.

“Where is my Junior Sister Yu Ying?” someone suddenly asked.

Yang Kai frowned and looked at the speaker, his expression turning odd. Because the one who spoke was Yin Lesheng!

This was interesting. He hadn’t even gone looking for him, but Yin Lesheng had come to him first—and immediately asked about Yu Ying. How did he know Yu Ying had been with him? After all, he’d changed his appearance.

But Yang Kai quickly realized what had happened and glanced meaningfully at Chang Hao, understanding that he must have been recognized when he made his move earlier.

“It’s been years, but I didn’t expect you to have grown this much,” Yin Lesheng said in shock, staring at Yang Kai. He clearly already knew Yang Kai’s true identity, since Zhong Zhenyong had sent him a message with some information. That was why Yin Lesheng was so surprised.

He had reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm thanks to his sect’s support and a good master’s guidance.

He didn’t believe Yang Kai had enjoyed such good fortune.

If Yang Kai hadn’t had those advantages, yet still reached the same level, it meant he had an extraordinary opportunity.

“You’re not bad yourself!” Yang Kai sneered. Now that his identity was exposed, there was no point hiding it. He simply reached up, removed the mask from his face, and revealed his true appearance.
