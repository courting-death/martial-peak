## Chapter 1699 — Deep Sea Supplies

Those several relatively weak martial artists had originally been controlled by the Insect Emperor using the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu; when Yang Kai arrived he had no intention of killing them, he only bound them in place.

At that moment, with Yang Kai's movements, each of them trembled, their faces contorting as if they were enduring tremendous pain; two of them spat white foam and collapsed, though they were not in mortal danger.

Pang Zhen observed coldly and no longer acted as recklessly as before.

In a short while, accompanied by a series of faint squeaking sounds, several streaks of light suddenly shot out from the minds of those martial artists.

Yang Kai seized them with one motion, then spread his hands and motioned toward Pang Zhen.

Several oddly shaped creatures, no larger than fingernails and black-and-red in color, struggled and resisted, but they could not break free of Yang Kai's control.

Pang Zhen stared for a long moment, then swallowed and asked, "This is the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu?"

He had never seen these insects before, but he sensed a wild, primeval aura from them, as if they hailed from a very ancient age, which gave him a feeling of danger.

“That’s right. Once afflicted by the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu, one’s life falls completely under the Gu Master’s control,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

"May I take a look?" Pang Zhen asked, eyes bright with excitement; he wanted to take one back to study. Though dangerous, if one researched them thoroughly and learned how to command them, it would be like gaining a secret technique.

Yang Kai looked at him with a half-smile. “If Island Master Pang isn’t afraid of them burrowing into your Sea of Consciousness, I can gladly let you have them.”

Pang Zhen's face went pale and he hesitated for a long time before resolutely shaking his head. "Forget it. I admit my strength is insufficient; let Sect Master Yang handle these things himself."

Yang Kai smiled lightly, flicked his wrist, and the struggling Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu were ground to powder.

Once it was clear the earlier incident had indeed been a misunderstanding — Yang Kai had not wantonly slaughtered innocents on Xiaguang Island but had instead helped him solve a tremendous problem — Pang Zhen's attitude toward Yang Kai warmed considerably.

Perhaps what he feared most was Yang Kai's strength.

The ability to send him flying with a mere gesture — there was no one in the entire Wuyou Sea who could match that.

Pang Zhen earnestly invited Yang Kai to visit his residence.

Yang Kai was likewise inclined to converse with him and readily agreed.

Pang Zhen, as Island Lord of Xiaguang Island, owned a mansion that occupied the island's best spirit land and had been constructed on a grand and magnificent scale.

Upon entering the mansion, Pang Zhen immediately ordered sumptuous dishes and jade-like wines to be served, and a dozen or so young maidens in thin veils, their graceful forms faintly visible, sang and danced to a mysterious accompaniment.

Several Origin Returning Realm experts from the island accompanied them.

The atmosphere was very lively.

The Sea Hall had heard much of the recent upheavals on the inland, but because they had not spread into the deep sea, the Sea Hall was not familiar with the finer details.

Pang Zhen's warm invitation to Yang Kai was partly because he believed in Yang Kai's strength and partly because he wished to probe the recent situation on the inland.

Yang Kai, of course, had nothing to hide.

When they learned that the Corpse Spirit Sect had been uprooted, everyone at the Sea Hall voiced astonishment; when they discovered Qian Tong truly was a Void King Realm powerhouse, worry clouded the faces of Pang Zhen and the others.

Dark Star had not produced a Void King Realm cultivator in tens of thousands of years — it was a realm spoken of in legend but never attained — and Pang Zhen and the others were unclear exactly how formidable a Void King Realm cultivator could be, yet that did not prevent them from feeling anxious.

They feared that Qian Tong's ambitions might swell and that he would stretch his claws toward the deep sea.

Although the Sea Hall's influence in the deep sea was extensive and deeply rooted, they were not confident they could withstand a Void King Realm figure.

Yang Kai watched their expressions and naturally understood what they were worried about; though amused in his heart, he did not expose the point.

Even setting aside whether Qian Tong had such intentions or not, even if he did, it would be impossible for him alone to subdue the Deep Sea — Yingyue Hall simply didn’t have that kind of power.

Pang Zhen and the others were somewhat overanxious.

"Island Lord Pang, I have a matter to ask of you — I wonder if you would agree?" After several cups, Yang Kai suddenly spoke.

"Sect Master Yang, please say it," Pang Zhen quickly looked up.

"I wish to meet with several Hall Masters of your Sea Hall," Yang Kai said with a smile, delicately sipping the fine wine.

Pang Zhen was taken aback. "May I ask what Sect Master Yang intends?"

Although Yang Kai's identity and standing were sufficient to warrant an audience with the Sea Hall's Hall Masters, Pang Zhen still felt obliged to inquire.

The others watched Yang Kai with curiosity.

"A profitable matter," Yang Kai said inscrutably. "I intend to open up a material exchange between the deep sea and the inland. As Island Lord Pang knows, the deep sea and the inland, owing to their different environments, each have their own specialties: materials that could be easily found in the deep sea might be extremely precious inland, and vice versa. If we could exchange goods, it would be of immense benefit to the disciples of each of our forces."

This was precisely why Yang Kai had stayed; otherwise, after killing the Insect Emperor he would have left and not lingered here wasting time.

Lingxiao Sect was no longer what it had once been; in the past it had numbered at most a few hundred cultivators and was easy to sustain with a modest supply of materials, but now Yang Kai had brought nearly ten thousand people from the Tongxuan Continent, and every month unimaginable provisions were required to support them; despite Lingxiao Sect's accumulations, it could not endure such consumption for many years.

Especially now, after the fierce battle with the Corpse Spirit Sect, the inland's resources had been depleted, the major sects' Yuan Qi had suffered heavy damage, and cultivation materials were exceedingly scarce.

Yang Kai saw the disparity in material production between the deep sea and the inland; if this could be brought about, it would not only relieve the immediate shortage but also allow one to quickly amass wealth by trading through middlemen.

Although he was now Lord of Dark Star and could travel freely and even coerce the Sea Hall into submission by force, Yang Kai did not wish to take that route.

The best course was to use strategy before force; he preferred to establish mutual, beneficial trade between the inland and the deep sea.

From the height of being Lord of Dark Star, he sometimes had to consider the welfare of the entire Dark Star.

Pang Zhen brightened at the proposal but soon frowned. "Sect Master Yang, you are not the first to think of this. The Sea Hall has had people suggest it before, but some special materials were difficult to transport and exchanges were inconvenient, so the matter was dropped. Although there is some trade between the deep sea and the inland now, it is limited to a few coastal cities."

Seeing his expression, Yang Kai knew that the Sea Hall was not uninterested in inland materials, but that the venture was simply too troublesome and time-consuming; otherwise, it would not have been left for him to propose.

Most importantly, they had no stable trade partners. With Sea Hall’s vast influence, only a handful of sects inland were qualified to stand on equal footing with them — the rest could only look up in awe. Yet those few forces showed no interest in trading with Sea Hall, leaving Sea Hall itself powerless despite its strength.

Yang Kai smiled. "What if I could resolve these difficulties?"

Pang Zhen's expression brightened. "Could Sect Master Yang truly accomplish that?"

Yang Kai nodded solemnly, his expression earnest.

Pang Zhen laughed heartily. "If Sect Master Yang can do that, then the matter is worth discussing! But I cannot decide this on my own; I must report it to the Hall Masters for their judgment."

"I have long heard of the Sea Hall's renown; the Hall Masters are wise and formidable — they surely would not refuse so beneficial a proposal," Yang Kai said with a chuckle.

Pang Zhen was in high spirits and raised his cup. "Then I shall toast to its success. If it bears fruit, I will surely ask Sect Master Yang to take good care of things."

If the matter succeeded, Pang Zhen would indisputably take the chief credit, which would be all gain and no loss for him; he might even leverage the opportunity to raise his standing within the Sea Hall, so he treated Yang Kai increasingly like an honored guest.

Late that night, after the feast had ended, Yang Kai was assigned to rest in a luxurious side chamber, tended by several fair young maidens.

Yang Kai sent them away, and the maidens' eyes held the resentment of wronged women — which made Yang Kai feel somewhat guilty.

Yang Kai had thought that his proposal would be of great benefit to the Sea Hall and that they would therefore be eager, but to his surprise, after waiting three days on Xiaguang Island no Hall Master of the Sea Hall had come to discuss the matter.

This left him somewhat puzzled.

Under normal circumstances, given the Sea Hall's power and the space arrays between islands, if the Sea Hall's main hall took the matter seriously, they could have reached Xiaguang Island within half a day.

A delay of three days could only indicate that the other party either lacked confidence in his ability or was not particularly enthusiastic about the proposal.

Yang Kai was not worried; with the threat of the Corpse Spirit Sect removed and with Ye Xijun holding the fort, whether he returned or not made little difference.

He took the opportunity to savor the changes since becoming a Star Lord.

As Lord of Dark Star, he could naturally travel anywhere at will; with sufficient Divine Sense and Saint Yuan, he could traverse millions or even tens of millions of li in an instant, though doing so placed a heavy burden on his body.

Crossing over one hundred thousand li in an instant was still no great difficulty for him.

That was but a trivial convenience of being a Star Lord.

The greatest advantage lay in training on Dark Star: Spiritual Qi surged into his body with ferocious abundance, allowing his cultivation speed to increase by tens to hundreds of times — something no one else could achieve.

In battle he could also easily draw upon Dark Star's Spiritual Qi and slaughter all enemies without effort — this had been proven before.

Yet one thing troubled Yang Kai: he vaguely perceived an invisible force enveloping Dark Star, a power with the characteristics of confinement and sealing, like a barrier that impeded cultivators on Dark Star from exploring and comprehending higher levels.

It was precisely because of this barrier that Dark Star had produced no Void King Realm cultivators for tens of thousands of years.
