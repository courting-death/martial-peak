## Chapter 2450 — I’m This Handsome

"Back in the day, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor also sought immortality and once searched for the Everlasting Tree. He even broke through the barriers between worlds and traveled to countless lower Star Domains. In every Star Domain he visited, innumerable Cultivation Stars were devoured by him, leaving devastation in his wake. It was precisely for this reason that he incurred the wrath of both heavens and men, and provoked universal outrage," Qi Hai said slowly. "But unfortunately, even the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was unable to find any trace of the Everlasting Tree."

Yang Kai felt a lingering fear after hearing this.

He was certain that the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had never been to the Hengluo Star Domain. If he had, he might really have found the Everlasting Tree, but his arrival would have brought an indelible disaster to the Hengluo Star Domain.

Qi Hai continued, “Unable to find the Everlasting Tree, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had to seek another way. It’s said that the reason all the Great Emperors besieged the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor in the Shattered Star Sea was because his actions had become intolerable to heaven and earth, but that’s only part of the reason.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted as he asked, “What other reason is there?”

“There was another, even greater reason. He wanted to make a move against another Great Emperor and seize something from him!”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai’s mind raced, and suddenly, as if recalling something, he exclaimed, “Could it be...?”

Qi Hai nodded, “Exactly as Brother Yang suspects. Unless there is an irreconcilable enmity, Great Emperors would never fight each other. But the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s actions had already touched the reverse scale and bottom line of all the Great Emperors. If they ignored such a thing, the next unfortunate one might be themselves. So they joined forces and declared war on the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. That battle shattered the heavens and earth, and the universe was torn apart. That was the origin of the Shattered Star Sea!”

“What the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor wanted to seize was the True Phoenix Fire of the Martial Flame Great Emperor!” Qi Hai said solemnly. “The True Phoenix Fire is the inheritance of the Fire Phoenix. The Fire Phoenix may die, but the Phoenix Fire will never be extinguished. It even possesses a heaven-defying power of nirvana and rebirth. That’s why the True Phoenix Fire is also called the Nirvana True Fire, ranked first among all the world’s strange flames. The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor wanted to obtain the True Phoenix Fire to comprehend the secret of immortality. If he had succeeded, he might really have achieved his wish.”

“In that battle, the Martial Flame Great Emperor, who was the main target of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, was the first to fall. The True Phoenix Fire was forced out. To prevent the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor from obtaining it, the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor used his Mountain and River Bell to suppress it. This was a last resort. Without the Mountain and River Bell, the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor’s strength plummeted, and he soon followed the Martial Flame Great Emperor’s fate. But in the chaos, the Mountain and River Bell and the suppressed True Phoenix Fire were sent away by another Great Emperor. Since then, their whereabouts have been unknown!”

“Over the years, countless cultivators have entered the Shattered Star Sea, hoping to find treasures left behind by the Great Emperors, but few know that the True Phoenix Fire was suppressed beneath the Mountain and River Bell.”

After hearing Qi Hai’s explanation, Yang Kai immediately understood why he had secretly stayed behind. He couldn’t help but grin and said, “Brother Qi, you really do know a lot.”

Qi Hai replied, “It’s only because of some special reasons that I’ve always paid attention to news about the True Phoenix Fire, and I’ve consulted countless ancient records for it.”

“Special reasons?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Qi Hai cupped his fists and said, “To be honest, my wife suffered a severe injury twenty years ago and has been unconscious ever since. I’ve tried everything to prolong her life, but it’s only a temporary solution. To truly save her, aside from the Immortal Source Liquid from the Everlasting Tree, only the True Phoenix Fire can do it.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened, and he snorted coldly, “Brother Qi, are you trying to ask me for the True Phoenix Fire? If so, then I’ve misjudged you. I was enjoying our conversation, but I didn’t expect you to have such intentions. Farewell!”

“Brother Yang, you misunderstand.” Qi Hai hurriedly waved his hands. “Could you hear me out?”

Yang Kai looked at him coldly and said, “We’re not related. Why should I care about your troubles?”

Qi Hai was so anxious that sweat beaded on his forehead. “If Brother Yang is willing to help me, I’m willing to pay any price. As long as you ask, I’ll do anything for you.”

“Even if I ask for your life?” Yang Kai grinned, revealing a wicked smile.

Qi Hai’s expression changed slightly, but he quickly smiled freely. “If Brother Yang truly saves my wife, I’ll kill myself in front of you.”

Yang Kai was slightly moved, twitching his mouth. “Madman!”

Qi Hai smiled and said, “Brother Yang, have you ever met a woman in your life with whom you could share life and death, never abandoning each other? If you have, then you’ll surely understand how I feel.”

Several beautiful figures suddenly flashed through Yang Kai’s mind, and he couldn’t help but feel a bit touched.

He wondered, if those women encountered such a situation, what would he do? Suddenly, he somewhat understood Qi Hai’s feelings.

“It’s a pity, but I can’t give you the True Phoenix Fire,” Yang Kai shook his head. The True Phoenix Fire was far too precious; he intended to keep it for Liu Yan. He couldn’t just hand it over because of Qi Hai’s words.

Who knew if Qi Hai was telling the truth? Even if he was, they didn’t have much of a relationship.

Qi Hai said, “Brother Yang, you really misunderstand. I don’t want your True Phoenix Fire.”

Yang Kai frowned, “Then what do you want?”

Qi Hai replied, “I just hope that, if it’s convenient for Brother Yang, you could come with me. You only need to use some of the nirvana power of the True Phoenix Fire to save my wife. It won’t cost you anything.”

“That’s all?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“That’s all!” Qi Hai nodded solemnly.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before asking, “What kind of injury did your wife suffer? Why must it be the True Phoenix Fire to save her?”

Qi Hai’s expression dimmed as he replied, “Rather than calling it an injury, it’s more accurate to say she was afflicted by a chilling poison. Beyond the borders of our Eastern Territory lies a vast and wild Ancient Land—an untamed place rarely visited by outsiders, where fortune and peril walk hand in hand. Many experts from the Eastern Territory venture there to seek opportunities and temper themselves. Twenty years ago, my wife journeyed alone into those wilds. A month later, she returned gravely wounded and has remained unconscious ever since. After our Qi Family Stronghold’s alchemists examined her, they determined the poison she suffered from was none other than the Heavenly Frost Earth Drizzle!”

“Heavenly Frost Earth Drizzle!” Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. “One of the Ten Deadliest Poisons?”

Qi Hai looked at Yang Kai in surprise. “Brother Yang, you know of Heavenly Frost Earth Drizzle?”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. “I’ve heard of it.”

Qi Hai gave a bitter smile. “Since you know it’s one of the Ten Deadliest Poisons, you must also know that there’s basically no cure for those afflicted.”

“That’s true!” Yang Kai sighed. The Ten Deadliest Poisons are incurable; being poisoned by one is essentially a death sentence, unless one encounters a supreme treasure like the Everlasting Tree.

“But the True Phoenix Fire, with its nirvana power, might give my wife a sliver of hope,” Qi Hai said, his eyes burning as he looked at Yang Kai. “My main purpose in entering the Shattered Star Sea this time was to find the True Phoenix Fire. I originally hoped to bring it back to Qi Family Stronghold, but after what happened just now, I realized how naive I was. With my current strength, let alone subduing the True Phoenix Fire, I can’t even get close to it.”

Earlier, when the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Power in Yang Kai’s body erupted and clashed with the True Phoenix Fire, Qi Hai had witnessed the terrifying battle, which made him tremble all over.

“Brother Qi, you overestimate me. I haven’t subdued it either, just temporarily suppressed it,” Yang Kai explained calmly.

“Suppressed...” Qi Hai gulped. That sounded even more unbelievable than having subdued the True Phoenix Fire. He looked at Yang Kai with admiration and muttered, “Brother Yang, you’re truly a divine man.”

Yang Kai frowned. “Although your feelings for your wife are enough to move heaven and earth, I’m afraid I’m powerless to help.”

Qi Hai’s face dimmed. He knew this wasn’t something that could be forced. Yang Kai hadn’t refined or subdued the True Phoenix Fire yet, so even if he wanted to help, he couldn’t. To save his wife, Yang Kai would first have to refine the True Phoenix Fire. Otherwise, if he tried to use it, it might burn her to ashes in an instant, let alone save her.

“Then... when Brother Yang refines the True Fire someday, could you come to Qi Family Stronghold in the Eastern Territory?” Qi Hai looked at Yang Kai with a pleading expression. “Now, this is the only way my wife can survive. Rest assured, Brother Yang, I swear never to reveal what I’ve seen today, or I’ll be struck by lightning.”

“Qi Family Stronghold is in the Eastern Territory?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

“Exactly.”

“If it’s the Eastern Territory, I might make a trip there.” Yang Kai nodded. Whether or not he could get information about Xiaoxiao from Yin Lesheng this time, he had to go to the Eastern Territory, because Xiaoxiao was most likely there.

“Really?” Qi Hai was overjoyed and became a bit flustered. “That’s wonderful. By the way, if you go to the Eastern Territory, just ask about the Wild Ancient Land. My Qi Family Stronghold is nearby.”

“We’ll see when the time comes.” Yang Kai didn’t agree right away. It was hard to make such a promise. If he failed to keep it, Qi Hai might resent him.

Qi Hai clearly understood this as well, but the initiative was entirely in Yang Kai’s hands, so he couldn’t force it. He could only take out a communication bead from his Spatial Ring and carefully hand it to Yang Kai. “Brother Yang, this is my communication bead. You might need it someday.”

Yang Kai took it and casually tossed it into his Spatial Ring, cupping his fists. “Then let’s part ways here.”

Qi Hai nodded with a complicated expression.

Before Yang Kai could leave, Qi Hai suddenly called out, “Brother Yang, wait!”

“What is it?” Yang Kai turned to look at him.

Qi Hai asked seriously, “Are you planning to chase after the Mountain and River Bell?”

Yang Kai grinned. “How could I miss out on a Great Emperor’s treasure? I have to give it a try.”

Qi Hai said, “The Mountain and River Bell of the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor possesses boundless power. Within the Dao Origin Realm, almost no one can subdue it unless they gain the recognition of the Artifact Spirit and it chooses its master.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai shook his hair and said with flair, “I’m this handsome. It should take a liking to me, right?”

Qi Hai was left speechless.
