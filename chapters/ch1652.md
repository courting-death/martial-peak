## Chapter 1652 — The Abandoned Disciple

When he said this, Chi Huo's mouth twitched; even he secretly believed Wei Feng did not deserve Su Yan, not even worthy to carry her shoes.

Yet this was indeed a prime chance to strike Ice Heart Valley—if they could force Ice Heart Valley to yield here, Fire Radiance Sect would gain a decisive advantage in the struggles to come.

Most importantly, this incident can be used to strike at Luo Li’s state of mind—to force a crack in her heart.

If this succeeded, it would become Luo Li's heart demon, and her cultivation would never be able to advance again.

Meanwhile he could push his own cultivation forward; with one side rising and the other falling, the future of Chi Lan Star would undoubtedly belong to Fire Radiance Sect.

No sooner had Chi Huo finished speaking than Ran Yunting stepped forward, her expression cold and severe. "Deluded fantasies! Su Yan is a Core Disciple of our Ice Heart Valley—how could she be given in marriage to another? She will spend her life in Ice Heart Valley and go nowhere else!"

Chi Huo let out a peculiar chuckle as he looked at Ran Yunting. "If I am not mistaken, what she cultivates should be your Ice Heart Valley's secret art—the Ice Jade Skill, correct?"

"So what if it is?" Ran Yunting asked, not knowing what scheme he had in mind.

“If that’s the case, then it’s simple. This old man can see that her mortal heart has been stirred, her Ice Heart tainted, and she’s already suffering backlash from her cultivation method—quite severely, it seems… Hm, at this rate, within a year or two her entire cultivation will dissipate, and she’ll end up as nothing more than an ordinary person. What use would she be to your Ice Heart Valley then?”

Ran Yunting's expression changed slightly; she thought to herself that the old fox Chi Huo had very keen eyes.

Su Yan's condition was well concealed—only her master could sense it. Yet unexpectedly, Chi Huo had seen it the first time he met her.

For a moment Ran Yunting's face clouded over; she glanced at Su Yan, and the disappointment in her eyes was plain.

But Su Yan acted as if she saw nothing, showing no change of expression—still wearing a faceful of blissful smiles, leaning against Yang Kai, as if cultivation and strength were mere fleeting clouds. As long as she could be with Yang Kai, even death would be worth it.

Ran Yunting's disappointment deepened.

"Su Yan..." Yang Kai was full of astonishment as he looked at his beloved, whose lovely eyes had been fixed on him.

He quickly released his Divine Sense and probed inside Su Yan; at last he detected a trace of something amiss.

The qi within Su Yan indeed fluctuated unevenly—clear signs of backlash from her cultivation technique. For now it was relatively minor, but over time it would inevitably worsen.

"It's all right," Su Yan said with a gentle smile, her expression serene, utterly unconcerned for her own fate.

"I'll find a way to resolve it for you," Yang Kai said, drawing a deep breath and looking at her solemnly as he promised.

"You can kill yourself, and thus resolve the difficulty before her!" Ran Yunting, full of rage, snapped at Yang Kai.

"Master, please don't say such things!" Su Yan's smile faded, her brows knitting, her expression solemn. "If my Junior Brother dies, I will not live on alone!"

Ran Yunting opened her mouth, staring at Su Yan in stunned disbelief.

It was the first time Su Yan had spoken to her in such a tone, and Ran Yunting was greatly shaken. All along, Su Yan had been utterly obedient—whatever she was asked to do, the disciple carried it out a hundredfold, making her very satisfied and highly valued.

Yet today she had defied her.

It seemed that this hard‑working master, who had taught her painstakingly and held such great expectations, was in Su Yan's heart not as important as a mere stripling.

Ran Yunting sneered coldly, her face icy; she fixed Yang Kai with a deep look and said in a low voice, "Boy, you have wronged Su Yan—even if you die, you cannot atone for your sin!"

After speaking she stepped back and closed her eyes, seemingly unwilling to involve herself further in what followed.

"Whether I have wronged Senior Sister is not for you to decide—who do you think you are?" Yang Kai snorted.

"Enough, this farce ends now!" Chi Huo rose, his eyes burning like flames as he glared at Luo Li. "I have stated my purpose. Luo Li, it is for you to choose. Hand the person over and I shall withdraw; if you do not..."

His words carried an unmistakable and severe threat.

The many elders of Ice Heart Valley all changed color.

Luo Li glanced at Chi Huo coolly, then turned to Luo Hai and softly asked, "Is this Lord Luo Hai's intent?"

She understood better than anyone that Chi Huo dared to come to Icebound Island so ostentatiously and brazenly demand the valley's finest disciple because Luo Hai was backing him from behind.

Without Luo Hai, Chi Huo would not dare to set foot within a thousand li of Icebound Island.

Luo Hai smiled at that and said gently, "Junior Sister Luo Li, that argument is hardly reasonable. This is a matter between your Ice Heart Valley and Chi Huo's Fire Radiance Sect; I merely happened to be present, adding to the commotion."

He shifted his tone and added, "But I do not think Chi Huo is entirely wrong. This Su Yan's talent is indeed uncommon, yet since she has suffered backlash from the Ice Jade Skill, she will likely not become a great figure. It would be better for her to marry Wei Feng; your two families could thus be bound by marriage, resolving the enmity between the two sides so you might live in harmony—wouldn't that be splendid?"

At his words Luo Li's face darkened; she realized Luo Hai had taken Fire Radiance Sect's side.

As for resolving the feud by marriage—that was sheer fantasy.

The two great sects had battled on Chi Lan Star for thousands, even tens of thousands of years; their hatred had become a blood‑deep grudge, impossible to mend. In this world, where Fire Radiance Sect exists there is no Ice Heart Valley, and where Ice Heart Valley exists there is no Fire Radiance Sect—the two sects would struggle forever, unyielding until death.

"I understand," Luo Li said with a slight nod, closing her long, clear eyes, clearly plunged into a difficult decision.

No one disturbed her; all the elders of Ice Heart Valley looked to Luo Li, eager to know what answer she would give.

Luo Hai wore a calm, untroubled expression as he quietly sipped his fragrant tea.

Chi Huo, however, looked utterly smug, chuckling oddly without cease.

He did not fear Luo Li's refusal—by hoisting Luo Hai's prestige as his banner he intended to press Ice Heart Valley into submission. As for that girl Su Yan, she was merely a pawn in the struggle.

If not Su Yan, there could be Zhang Yan, Wang Yan... Ice Heart Valley had so many female disciples—were they afraid they would not find a suitable candidate?

Wei Feng did not wail; at that moment he was like a cat that had sensed fish, his eyes rolling greedily. Though his cheek throbbed with pain, he still looked at Su Yan with a cruel smile, his gaze lecherous and sinister, as if she were his plaything.

Inwardly he swore to be ruthless—once he had Su Yan in his hands he would torment her, so as to make Yang Kai learn the cost of provoking him.

Yang Kai and Su Yan stood side by side at the center of the Ice Palace, as if they were outsiders to the scene.

No one cared about their feelings or opinions; in such high‑level negotiations, the two of them had no voice at all.

A faint trace of sorrow rippled through the happiness in Su Yan’s beautiful eyes, and she tightened her hold on Yang Kai’s hand.

She quietly resolved that if the Grand Elder truly chose to concede, then she would use her own life to create a narrow chance for Yang Kai to escape! As for herself—even in death she would never go to that Fire Radiance Sect.

Yang Kai watched coldly as if unconcerned, carefully observing the changes in Luo Li's expression.

After a long while he sighed, leaned to Su Yan's ear and whispered, "Senior Sister, do you trust me?"

Su Yan did not hesitate; she gave a slight nod.

"Very well," Yang Kai grinned. "Your Junior Brother promises you: today no one will take you away—anyone who dares set their sights on you, I'll have them all killed!"

"Then Senior Sister will wait and see," Su Yan said, winking at Yang Kai.

That playful look left Yang Kai stunned; he had never seen this side of Su Yan—perhaps the arrival of such grave danger had made her dare to do things she ordinarily would not.

Though their voices were low, how could they hide from Luo Hai and Chi Huo?

Hearing Yang Kai's boast, the two Void King Realm cultivators sneered at him with faces full of disdain.

"Luo Li, it's time to decide," Luo Hai urged with impatience.

He was eager to take Yang Kai back to Cuiwei Star to study the secrets on Yang Kai's body; he had no wish to linger here.

Luo Li opened her eyes, and in an instant every gaze within the Ice Palace turned to her.

The first person she looked at was Su Yan; a trace of guilt flashed in her beautiful eyes, but it passed in an instant, unnoticed by others.

"Take her away," Luo Li said. "I hope you will treat her well in the future!" After speaking, her aura wilted suddenly like a punctured balloon, and even her face paled slightly.

Clearly making such a concession violated her true intent and only worsened the injuries she already bore.

"Grand Elder..." Ran Yunting breathed softly.

Although she had already guessed it in her heart, when the Grand Elder gave that answer, she still couldn’t accept it. Reflexively, she cried out, but could say nothing more—only looked at Su Yan with deep regret, let out a long sigh, and said heavily, “This is the path you chose yourself. Don’t come to regret it in the future!”

In that moment she finally decided to abandon Su Yan.

Leaving aside that she could not undo the flaw in Su Yan's heart, even if Su Yan were kept she would accomplish little in the future. To place the entire Ice Heart Valley in peril for such a disciple was not worth it. And she could not disobey Luo Li's order.

If she truly sacrificed the entire sect for Su Yan, she would become a sinner in Ice Heart Valley.

She would not do such a thing; the choice between the sect and a disciple was self‑evident.

She closed her eyes, refusing to look at Su Yan.

"How satisfying!" Chi Huo laughed heartily.

After so many years, he had finally completely subdued Luo Li, forcing her to yield before him; though he had relied on Luo Hai's prestige, this outcome was exactly what Chi Huo had hoped for.
