## Chapter 1123 — Ran into a Brick Wall

Everyone present, regardless of strength, felt something unusual about that Demonic Flame. None of them had ever seen such a bizarre power; the profound intent that rolled off that Demonic Flame made them uncomfortable, as if they were being tormented, and no one wanted to imagine what would happen if they were struck head-on by such power.

For a moment, many displayed looks of dread and shock.

Ba Qingyan of the Haike Family rolled his eyes and gestured for his clan's fighters, quietly leading a group to withdraw a good distance away. He had finally noticed that Yang Kai was somewhat off — a mere Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior, how could he be so brash facing Xu Zhishen?

Regardless of whatever backing Yang Kai had, Ba Qingyan had no intention of wading into that mess. The Xu Family’s fight with Yang Kai had nothing to do with him; he was perfectly happy to stand aside and enjoy the spectacle. What occupied his thoughts instead was how to deal with the traitor Wu Yi later.

Anyone who dared to leave their clan without permission would meet no good end!

Yang Flame, who had seen Yang Kai fight before, didn’t know whether Yang Kai could escape intact against Xu Zhishen, but obediently took Wu Yi and Yu Feng aside so they wouldn’t be harmed by the coming clash.

Seeing them fall back, the Xu Family’s fighters likewise retreated.

In the blink of an eye, only Yang Kai and Xu Zhishen faced each other across the gap.

“Old dog, my principle has always been: if people don’t offend me, I don’t offend them. Since you came, don’t think you can leave!” Yang Kai was not one to be reasoned with, and the old man’s repeated taunts of “little beast” inflamed him further — he secretly vowed to teach him a lesson today.

Whether Haike Family or Xu Family, he didn’t rate them. Neither clan even had an expert of the Origin Returning Realm; Yang Kai was confident they couldn’t do much to him. Besides, even if an Origin-Grade expert interfered, he believed he could escape unscathed.

So he had no concerns whatsoever.

Xu Zhishen’s face darkened. After his mind had been inadvertently harmed earlier, he had been searching to see if Yang Kai wore some fierce Divine Soul Secret Treasure, but found nothing. Alarmed, he dared not be reckless. He raised his hand and a nearly invisible black thread suddenly shot at Yang Kai.

Just now, he had used that very item—concealing it within his Saint Yuan—to effortlessly slay the cultivator named Qiu Yuan. Aside from Ba Qingyan, who knew him inside and out, no one else had noticed. Everyone thought his Saint Yuan was simply extraordinary. However, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was powerful, and he had long been wary of that strange Secret Treasure. The moment his opponent made a move, Yang Kai met it head-on with a single sword strike.

The profound intent contained within the Demonic Flame was to incinerate all things; it was the foundation of his strength. He believed that even if the thin thread was an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure, it could not withstand the flame’s burning.

A clear metallic clash rang out. Sparks flew from Yang Kai’s Demonic Flame longsword where it struck the thin thread. At the same time, a frigid, sinister energy erupted from the thread and swept toward Yang Kai from all directions.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. His powerful Divine Sense locked on the black thread and he found that things were different from what he expected: his Demonic Flame had surprisingly little effect on this nearly invisible thread. Though there were violent burning sounds, he couldn’t sever it.

Xu Zhishen smiled faintly, smug as if he held the winning move, and called out, “Bring me your life!”

The instant his words fell, the slender black line divided into countless threads and wove into a tightly sealed net that descended to cover Yang Kai.

Yang Kai dodged and struck back with a palm. His Heaven-Covering Palm swelled monstrously, seeming to blot out the heavens and make the sky above the onlookers grow dim.

Violent energy ripples burst forth; the web of black threads shattered in an instant. Xu Zhishen’s body wavered as he looked at Yang Kai in disbelief — he hadn’t expected this covert killing move to be undone.

It was because he feared Yang Kai could wound his Divine Sense that Xu Zhishen had held nothing back, attempting to kill Yang Kai as quickly as possible to save face for the Xu Family. Little did he know it would be ineffective.

This Third Stage of the Saint Realm youth not only had sharp perception but was ruthless; he had long seen through Xu Zhishen’s hidden killing move. The magnitude and destructive power of his Saint Yuan equaled his own — if not, he couldn’t have undone the shadow soul threads.

His method of countering seemed simple, but actually required tremendous strength.

If it were a fighter of equal rank like Ba Qingyan it would make sense, but the opponent clearly was only a Saint Realm warrior.

He actually had the ability to fight him head-on? Xu Zhishen nearly cried out in surprise. If his mind had been injured earlier and led him to suspect a Secret Treasure, he no longer dared to think that.

The other party seemed not at all weaker than himself!

This youth was strange! No wonder he dared to shout and provoke; he had been playing the wolf in sheep’s clothing. No wonder Qiu Yuan had returned badly injured and couldn’t explain himself — it seemed this youth had inflicted that wound; Qiu Yuan had been too afraid to admit it.

Inflicting grievous injury on a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm would breed terror; such a skill was truly horrifying.

At that thought Xu Zhishen no longer underestimated Yang Kai. His expression turned grave as the black threads that had been barred by the Heaven-Covering Palm were drawn back into his body, and he shoved a Pill into his mouth and swallowed.

The onlookers gaped at the sight.

Whether Haike Family or Xu Family, everyone’s mouths hung open.

They had thought that with Xu Zhishen personally acting, Yang Kai would be taken down at once. Ridiculous that he still spat insults and humiliation — some Xu Family fighters had even gleefully prepared to watch Yang Kai be trampled and grovel for mercy.

Who would have expected that after Xu Zhishen’s strike Yang Kai remained calm and unruffled, not a hair disheveled, while the Xu elder had to swallow a Pill with a grave expression.

Unless one was blind, it was obvious things were not as they had assumed.

“Elder Ba… what… what does this mean?” Wu Ke, Wu Yi’s cousin, asked Ba Qingyan softly — to be honest, he didn’t understand.

Upon hearing him, everyone’s gazes turned to Ba Qingyan, hoping he would explain.

“Explain what?” Ba Qingyan snorted coldly. “The Xu Family just kicked the iron board this time!”

“Ah!” Even the confused Wu Ke caught the meaning in Ba Qingyan’s words and stared at Yang Kai in astonishment. He said in a strange tone, “Elder Ba, he only appears to be a Third Stage of the Saint Realm. Even if he can resist, Senior Xu will soon defeat him — after all, the gap in stages is there.”

He spoke as if consoling himself: Wu Yi had left her family and entangled herself with this young man; if the youth died her fate would be grim too. He hesitated to kick someone when they were down, though he wasn’t keen to see her rise again.

“Who knows.” Ba Qingyan’s eyes were deep; his attention was no longer fixed on Xu Zhishen, but instead he studied Yang Kai. Since Yang Kai had arrived he had hardly bothered with him — now he could no longer afford to ignore him.

Where did Wu Yi find this brat? He was some kind of prodigy.

The fighters of the two clans couldn’t believe their eyes. Wu Yi and Yu Feng were even more astonished.

They knew Yang Kai’s background better than anyone: it had been Yu Feng who had found Yang Kai sleeping within the blood-red crystal and took it back to the warship. Though they had gotten along well, everyone treated Yang Kai as a drifter who had wandered here. Wu Yi had given him Dragon Lair Mountain to live in because he knew the outside world better and might be asked for help in the future.

None of them had suspected Yang Kai’s foundation was so astonishing.

Yang Flame proudly said beside them, “Don’t worry, Yang Kai won’t be at a loss. Last time he killed a few Saint King Realm fighters in short order and chased that Qiu Yuan away. This old geezer looks a bit stronger than Qiu Yuan, but not by much.”

“What!” Wu Yi covered her mouth, “You’re saying… he killed Saint King Realm fighters? You’re not joking?”

Yang Flame sneered, “Killed them right in front of me. It was terrifying — I was knocked unconscious for three days before I woke.”

She exaggerated the scene then and there; judging by her gesturing, there was no hint of fear — only excitement. Wu Yi and Yu Feng listened, hearts struck by terror and disbelief.

“Youngster, I admit I underestimated you. But that changes nothing — I, Xu Zhishen, will kill you. Don’t expect to see tomorrow’s sun!” Xu Zhishen swallowed another Pill; the wound to his Divine Sense dulled enough that he could press on.

“That thin thread isn’t a Secret Treasure?” After repelling the killing move, Yang Kai had not pursued, instead he sized Xu Zhishen up and suddenly realized: the jet-black thread didn’t feel like a Secret Treasure at all. If it were, his Demonic Flame would have had an effect. The dark thread felt more like a Divine Sense attack — an actual, substantive assault on the spirit.

He suddenly brightened. “Nice— I’ll take that thread.”

“You’ve got the courage to speak—let’s see if you can survive the consequences!” Xu Zhishen gave a cold snort as a powerful aura suddenly burst from his body. The ground beneath his feet sank several feet, his robes billowed without wind, and his face was filled with murderous intent. A chilling energy swept in all directions, and it seemed to everyone’s ears that ghostly winds were howling all around.

Countless, dense shadow soul threads shot from his body, as black as night, making him look hideous like a shaggy monster. The threads surged toward Yang Kai, then converged into a thumb-thick pointed spear that spun at high speed and barreled toward Yang Kai’s chest.
