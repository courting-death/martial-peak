## Chapter 132 — Playing in the Water

Strictly speaking, this was the first offensive martial skill that Yang Kai had learned. Prior to this, all his attacks relied solely on the Yang Liquid within his Dantian and his own reflexes.

However, that alone could not fully unleash his potential. With martial skills, it was different; martial skills were the foundation of a warrior's combat, allowing one to harness the power of Yuan Qi.

What he had just executed was merely an experiment. Although it had succeeded, it was likely not the full extent of this martial skill's effectiveness. In actual combat, martial skills were unleashed in an instant; who would slowly gather and feel it out like Yang Kai had just done?

But after all, he had just learned it and could not yet reach the level of mastery that comes with experience. This required time and the accumulation of experience.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai clenched his fists, his mind replaying the scene of that punch. His heart surged with excitement.

The Little Stone Man had only contained the cultivation method for this martial skill and had not told Yang Kai its name, so he needed to come up with one.

Furrowing his brows for a moment, Yang Kai decided to call it "Flame Yang Explosion."

The sudden eruption of energy from thirty-six meridians was a surprise attack that could easily catch someone off guard.

Such a move could only be supported by Yang Kai's energy three times at most; after three strikes, his energy would be completely depleted.

Others would certainly hesitate to use it recklessly, but Yang Kai had so much spare Yang Liquid in his Dantian that he need not worry about this issue.

This also meant that Yang Kai could quickly master Flame Yang Explosion, making his efficiency in practicing martial skills far superior to others.

Flame Yang Explosion should be a set of Upper-Level Earth-Grade martial skills. His luck was quite good to have obtained a martial skill from the realm of fist techniques.

If he had received a martial skill from sword or staff techniques, he would have likely been very disappointed. After all, he had no weapons at hand; what good would it do him?

After tidying up his emotions, Yang Kai prepared to spend the day mastering Flame Yang Explosion to enhance his combat prowess.

A day later, having made small progress with Flame Yang Explosion, the five of them gathered once more.

Except for Nie Yong, who looked somewhat dejected, the other four were quite satisfied with the martial skills they had obtained. Yang Kai, needless to say, had worked hard for several days and finally acquired a set of Upper-Level Earth-Grade Flame Yang Explosion, along with an unexamined Little Stone Man.

As for what the others had obtained, no one spoke up, but judging by their expressions, they seemed to have gained quite a bit.

Only Nie Yong was cursing and complaining, clearly unhappy. According to him, he had received a set of whip techniques, which was incredibly frustrating.

Du Yishuang, standing beside Yang Kai, squinted and smiled softly, saying, "Evil people get their just deserts. It's well-deserved!"

Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

Lan Chudie offered some comforting words, which helped alleviate Nie Yong's frustration somewhat.

The five of them set off again. As they walked, Lan Chudie suddenly turned to Yang Kai and asked, "What happened to the Yang Flame Stones you picked up a few days ago?"

"I threw them away," Yang Kai replied.

"Hmph, you won't cry until you see the coffin," Nie Yong said, feeling a sense of balance in his heart upon seeing Yang Kai's wasted effort.

Yang Kai ignored him. Little did he know, those Yang Flame Stones had long since transformed into energy stored within his Dantian.

In this place, there were no sun or moon, no stars; it was impossible to measure the passage of time. However, Yang Kai estimated that they had walked for over two days before finally emerging from the rocky outcrop.

Along the way, they encountered several corpses of disciples from the three sects, but it was unclear what dangers they had faced in the rocky outcrop. Regardless, Yang Kai and the others had traveled safely.

Upon exiting the rocky outcrop, all five of them involuntarily exhaled a sigh of relief. Since entering this Inheritance Celestial Cave, they had been surrounded by that environment, seeing nothing but stones, which inevitably felt oppressive.

Outside the rocky outcrop was a dense forest, lush and green, with trees growing thickly together.

Although there were many dangers in the forest, they had already come this far; could they really retreat back to the rocky outcrop? Moreover, where there were dangers, there would surely be opportunities. Not to mention, in such a vast forest, there would undoubtedly be plenty of spiritual herbs and miraculous medicines.

The group did not hesitate, remaining vigilant of their surroundings as they plunged into the forest.

Not long after, Zuo An suddenly gasped softly and bent down to examine the ground. The others halted their steps and looked at him.

After a moment, Zuo An straightened up and said with certainty, "Someone passed through here a couple of days ago, and there were quite a few of them."

Upon hearing this, Nie Yong's expression brightened, and he said, "It must be the other disciples from the three sects who have also arrived here."

Zuo An frowned slightly. "It's hard to say. No one knows if there are outsiders still in this Inheritance Celestial Cave."

His words sent a chill down everyone's spines. This Inheritance Celestial Cave had been sealed for at least a thousand years; if there were people inside, who could they be?

Zuo An also felt that this possibility was unlikely and quickly added, "I was just saying it casually, but it should be the disciples from the three sects."

"Then let's catch up to them," Nie Yong suggested. "If it's Senior Brother Jie or Senior Sister Su ahead, that would be great."

Lan Chudie frowned slightly but nodded in agreement. Although she temporarily took on the role of leader in this small group, their overall strength was not high. If they encountered any significant danger, they would likely suffer heavy losses.

Rather than risking their lives exploring here, it would be better to find the senior brothers and sisters from Lingxiao Pavilion. With their protection, the safety factor would increase significantly.

"Then let's go. We'll find them."

The group followed the traces left behind a few days ago and searched for half a day before suddenly coming upon a small lake.

There were many footprints by the lake, indicating that the disciples from the three sects had briefly rested here.

Since the disciples from the three sects had rested here, it meant that there was no danger in this area. Given that the five of them had been traveling and camping out, they were quite exhausted. After a brief discussion, they decided to rest here for a moment before setting off again.

The five of them spread out to sit and recover. Not long after, Lan Chudie suddenly approached Du Yishuang and whispered something. Du Yishuang slowly shook her head, her expression hesitant and conflicted, but then she gritted her teeth and nodded, her face slightly flushed.

After that, Lan Chudie walked over to Yang Kai and gently patted his shoulder.

"What's the matter?" Yang Kai opened his eyes and looked at her.

"Come with me for a moment," Lan Chudie said, glancing at Nie Yong and Zuo An not far away, and beckoned Yang Kai to follow her.

Furrowing his brows, Yang Kai was unsure of her intentions but still followed her out.

After walking a short distance, Yang Kai saw Du Yishuang waiting there.

"What’s going on?" Yang Kai asked, unsure of what the two women were gathering for, as they did not seem particularly close.

Lan Chudie smiled shyly, "Little Sister Du and I want to take a bath here."

Yang Kai's expression turned strange as he looked up and down at the two women. Du Yishuang's face turned red, while Lan Chudie also appeared somewhat shy. She stamped her foot and said, "What are you thinking? I just need you to help guard and keep others away from here."

Yang Kai laughed in disbelief, "Sister Lan, you must have the wrong person. You should be asking Nie Yong for this; he would definitely be willing."

Lan Chudie knew that Yang Kai was somewhat displeased with her actions over the past few days. She became a bit annoyed and said, "If I could trust him, why would I come to you?"

"Sister, you trust me?" Yang Kai smirked, "Who knows, I might peek as well."

Lan Chudie laughed, "If you dare, I don’t mind; after all, Little Sister Du will teach you a lesson."

Yang Kai cleared his throat. With things having come to this point, he could no longer refuse. Moreover, since Du Yishuang was going down as well, he might as well protect her.

"Alright, you two hurry up," Yang Kai nodded.

Seeing that he agreed, Lan Chudie smiled, "Now you’re talking sense. Just stay here. Du Xiaomei and I will go to the other side."

With that, she linked arms with Du Yishuang and walked over. After taking a few steps, she turned back and warned, "You mustn't peek!"

"Okay, okay, okay!" Yang Kai replied while glancing at the situation by the lake. The lighting here was not very good, and there was a large rock standing in the water about ten zhang away from the lake's edge. It served as a natural barrier; as long as the two women hid behind the rock, Yang Kai wouldn't be able to peek even if he wanted to. The reason Lan Chudie had called him was merely a precaution.

Since they had already found a spot, Yang Kai didn't pay much attention and sat down facing the lake.

Before long, the sound of splashing water came from that side. Yang Kai, who was meditating with his eyes closed, opened them and indeed saw many women's clothes placed on the large rock. The distance was too far to see clearly; apart from that, he could see nothing else. Lan Chudie and Du Yishuang had hidden their bodies behind the rock, and unless one had the ability to see through stone, it was futile to discuss anything.

Yang Kai didn't particularly dislike Lan Chudie, but he didn't have strong feelings for her either. They had no grievances or enmities, and they were fellow disciples. Besides being somewhat displeased with her attitude a few days ago, he had no other issues.

He thought it was time to leave this group and act alone to avoid being bothered, but he had no idea where Su Mu was now.

Just as he was lost in thought, a light sound of footsteps suddenly came from behind him.

Yang Kai turned around to see Nie Yong sneaking over, his eyes fixed on the rock on the other side of the lake, a look of fervor in his eyes, and his breathing somewhat heavy.

Seeing Yang Kai looking at him, Nie Yong merely returned a disdainful smile and quickly approached him, threatening, "You didn’t see anything. Just sit here obediently and don’t move. If you dare say anything, I’ll make you regret it!"

Yang Kai looked at him indifferently. Nie Yong thought Yang Kai was scared and sneered, then swiftly walked past him.

The lake was filled with the pleasant laughter of two women and the splashing of water. The sounds were like a siren's call, intoxicating and soul-stirring, causing Nie Yong's blood to boil.

Just thinking about Lan Chudie's curvaceous and smooth figure hidden behind that rock made it hard for him to contain himself.

Just a few more steps, just a few more steps, and he would be able to imprint the beauty behind the rock into his eyes.

Yang Kai let out a cold laugh, leisurely cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting, "Senior Brother Nie, what are you doing over there?"
