## Chapter 1354 — On the Brink

Held fast by the vortices of the Mirror Lake, the puppet could barely move; Yang Kai’s Heaven-Covering Palm struck the puppet’s body with deadly accuracy. A thunderous boom rang out, and under the force the already-unsteady construct toppled straight to the ground.

Yang Kai hurriedly stepped back two paces and did not strike again.

For him, the main priority right now was to contend with the puppet. Until he found the wisp of Spirit Essence that controlled its movements, any attack would be meaningless.

Cai He and Du Sisi clearly understood Yang Kai’s intent and, taking advantage of the moment, strengthened the power of their formations. More vortices erupted across the Mirror Lake, and the skyful of shimmering lights grew denser.

Bound by the two mighty formations, the puppet was unable to rise for the time being, its eyes flashing with unceasing crimson light.

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent as he watched the puppet’s motions, silently monitoring the Artifact Spirit for any changes while sending out a strand of Divine Sense to probe the puppet’s body.

He suspected that with a wisp of spirit hidden inside the puppet there must be anomalies, and such anomalies could only be detected by Divine Sense.

While he investigated, an unexpected change occurred: the lake’s surface suddenly became turbulent. The puppet, unable to rise quickly, flew into a rage and began wildly swinging its pitch-black great staff, smashing it about in all directions with no aim.

Such attacks posed no real danger to Yang Kai, but Cai He’s face changed drastically when he saw this.

The reason was plain: to maximize their formations’ power earlier, the devices Cai He had dispersed covered only a limited area. If the puppet’s indiscriminate smashing ruptured any of those hidden devices, the entire formation would collapse.

Moreover, the puppet’s ferocious assault stirred up tremendous force that already affected the formations; if left unchecked, the formations might self-destruct before long.

In a panic, Cai He could only slightly relax his control over the puppet to ensure the main formation held; Du Sisi did the same, reluctantly weakening the power of the Ground-Imprisonment Formation.

They had never encountered anything like this before and were thoroughly vexed.

The firefly-like lights and the vortices in the Mirror Lake immediately lessened. Deprived of some of the restraining power, the puppet indeed stopped its berserk swinging and clambered up on its hands and feet. Once it rose, it fixed its gaze on Yang Kai, then glanced down at the Mirror Lake beneath its feet with a strangely contemplative expression.

Immediately after, it opened its mouth wide. With a low buzzing sound, countless wasp-like creatures spewed forth from within. Each was only about the size of a fist, yet there were hundreds of them, gathering into a swarm that circled in the air for a moment before surging straight toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, shock plain on his face.

It was the first time he’d seen the puppet possess such a bizarre ability; in his earlier probes it had never released these wasps.

A sweep of Divine Sense made Yang Kai’s face go grave—these wasps were all tiny puppets, and each emanated an extremely uncanny aura.

He could not allow them to close in. Demonic Flame boiled in his hand as a pitch-black longsword materialized; with a swing, blade-radiance slashed outward.

Boom—boom—boom...

An unexpected scene unfolded—the wasps, which appeared to possess considerable power, suddenly exploded the instant the sword light struck them, as if they were utterly fragile. Yet Yang Kai’s brows furrowed even more tightly.

Their explosion was not caused by his attacks; they were self-destructing.

Each wasp’s self-detonation unleashed a chilling wave of energy, and when they burst the air filled with clumps of yellow mist. The mists connected into sheets, soon shrouding the whole space.

Yang Kai accidentally inhaled some and instantly felt dizzy. Alarmed, he barked, “They’re poisonous—hold your breath!”

As he spoke, a black ball of Demonic Flame formed in his hand and smashed into the yellow mist. Wherever the Demonic Flame passed, the yellow vapor was burned away; though ferociously toxic, the yellow mist could not withstand the flame’s searing.

Only then did Cai He and Du Sisi relax. Hearing Yang Kai’s shout had left them on edge, fearing disaster; seeing the mist consumed, they were overjoyed and focused wholly on driving the formations.

Yang Kai showed no sign of easing; blade-radiance after blade-radiance cleaved out, cutting the wasp-puppets to pieces and burning the yellow vapor with Demonic Flame.

Since this puppet could employ such tricks, it surely had other, stronger methods. Time was not on their side, and Yang Kai felt a growing unease.

In little time, the hundreds of wasp-puppets were slaughtered, leaving the area cleared.

At that moment Yang Kai’s face shifted, then brightened with delight: a message arrived from the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit.

It had found the hiding place of the wisp of spirit controlling the puppet!

As he expected, it was located in the puppet’s chest; all the puppet’s movements were driven by that strand of spirit, and through the Artifact Spirit’s relentless probing they had finally uncovered a clue.

A hard light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes. His Divine Sense shifted; the Artifact Spirit wrapped within the puppet returned to its Fire Bird shape and soared over the puppet, spitting fireballs to press the puppet and draw its attention.

Yang Kai himself fixed on the puppet’s chest. Seizing the moment while it was distracted by the Artifact Spirit, he flickered forward, leapt high, and slammed a brutal punch into its chest.

With a thunderous rebound Yang Kai was thrown back, yet the puppet’s chest remained unscathed—not even a scratch marred it.

That blow was only a probe. No effect was seen, and Yang Kai was unsurprised. He narrowed his eyes and called out, “Friends, push the formations to their limit—this time the outcome will decide everything!”

On hearing him, Cai He and Du Sisi wasted no time. Channeling Saint Yuan, they fully activated the Mirror Lake Mud Dragon Formation and the Ground-Imprisonment Formation.

In an instant the sky-wide light reappeared; vortices of various sizes opened on the lake’s surface and muddy dragons surged forth, rushing to the puppet to coil about its limbs and bind its movement.

Coupled with the Fire Bird’s assault, the puppet immediately fell to the defensive. Still, the pitch-black great staff in its hands once more swung aimlessly.

This time Cai He and Du Sisi paid it no heed and did not relax their formations’ might.

Seeing the puppet slowed, Yang Kai beamed and thrust his Demonic Flame longsword forward; a blade-radiance cleaved into the puppet’s chest.

Flame scattered and the blade-radiance vanished without trace, yet the puppet’s chest showed no change.

Cai He and Du Sisi watched this and felt their hearts sink.

Although they could use the formations to restrain the puppet’s movement, if Yang Kai could not break its defenses all their efforts would be in vain. The situation no longer allowed them reflection; they pinned all their hopes on Yang Kai, silently praying he possessed more than the few tricks he’d shown.

To their dismay, Yang Kai unleashed another pitch-black, sword-like strike toward the puppet’s breast.

The next instant the two were stunned—this sword-like blow actually left a faint mark on the puppet’s body! Though slight, it was the first real injury inflicted on the puppet by the combined efforts of the three.

This naturally filled Cai He and Du Sisi with unbounded joy; when they looked at Yang Kai their faces could not help but show admiration.

They had sensed from Yang Kai and the Artifact Spirit’s prior attacks that the puppet’s body was extraordinarily tough—so much so that even an Origin Returning Realm expert might find it hard to harm. Yet Yang Kai had done it.

That meant there was hope: he might be able to shatter the puppet’s body and eliminate the spirit hidden within!

Excitement surged in their hearts, as if they could already see the dawn; they placed immeasurable hope in Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stared at the faint mark, his expression darkening. That previous strike had been his Space Blade, a spatial power he condensed into a blade. Though it resembled sword-radiance, it was fundamentally different.

The Space Blade was Yang Kai’s trump card—capable of devouring all. Its might was unfathomable, yet it had only caused that small wound. To truly tear open the puppet’s chest would require at least a hundred Space Blades striking the same point.

Would Cai He and Du Sisi be able to sustain their formations that long?

It was not that Yang Kai doubted them, but the puppet was too tenacious: its wild swinging not only kept him from closing in but also threw the two great formations into chaos. Over time a formation’s structure could break, making it impossible to strike the same spot accurately.

Thinking was useless now. Yang Kai’s face chilled and he no longer restrained himself. Space Blade after Space Blade shot forth, striking toward the faint mark.

The Space Blades hit silently; unlike a sword-radiance, there was no sound upon impact.

As time passed the wound in the puppet’s chest gradually widened, but Cai He and Du Sisi went deathly pale and trembled. To sustain the formations they had poured every last reserve of Saint Yuan into them, swallowing many restorative pills yet still falling short.

Worse, after the puppet’s prolonged thrashing and assault the stability of the two great formations had been severely affected and had become perilously fragile. The vortices and muddy dragons produced by the Mirror Lake Mud Dragon Formation, and the firefly-like lights of the Ground-Imprisonment Formation, all sharply diminished.

With the restrictions weakened, the puppet was much less constrained and Yang Kai’s strikes often failed to land cleanly, leaving him frustrated.

While the three were anxious and helpless, the puppet displayed overwhelming power: as it swung the great staff the Fire Bird could not come within an inch and could only skirt around, trailing attacks of pure flame to distract and hold its attention.
