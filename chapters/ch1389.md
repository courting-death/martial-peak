## Chapter 1389 — I Am the Emperor of the Starry Sky

Yang Kai had never seen that ring before, and he was certain Yang Yan had never possessed such a Secret Treasure; it seemed to have materialized from nowhere, and its grade was something Yang Kai could not discern at a glance, which astonished him greatly.

He knew that even an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure could be identified by his eyesight; could this ring possibly be a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure?

The very thought made Yang Kai start in alarm.

After a while, everything suddenly returned to calm, and the anomalous changes in heaven and earth vanished in an instant.

Yet the Flowing Flame Sandland’s First Layer Heat-Flame Zone — the very zone that had made the Dark Star’s warriors quake in fear — was gone, leaving only a parched, dark-red land where it had stood, a sight that struck terror into the eyes.

Yang Yan slowly opened her eyes. Yang Kai was just about to call out to her when he suddenly noticed a trace of unfamiliarity flicker within her beautiful gaze. He froze on the spot, narrowing his eyes as he stared at her.

Yang Yan toyed with the ring on her hand, a smile curling at the corner of her mouth as if she had recovered something precious, utterly delighted.

She then extended a fair arm and slipped the ring onto her wrist; with a flash of light the ring shrank and settled perfectly on her pale wrist. Yang Yan shook it with joy, a look of satisfaction crossing her face.

"Yang Kai!" she cried, raising her delicate head as she called out from midair.

Yang Kai did not answer; instead he fixed his attention on her all the more, for although her appearance had not changed, she gave him an utterly alien impression, as if she had become a different person, which made him uneasy.

He did not know why Yang Yan had undergone such a change, but it was undoubtedly connected to the earlier anomaly; more than the disappearance of the First Layer Heat-Flame Zone, he wanted to know what had happened to Yang Yan herself.

Yang Yan paid no mind to his silence; she smoothed the hair at her ear and, in a coquettish voice, said, "I know who I am now."

"Who are you?" Yang Kai asked aloud.

"I am the Emperor of the Starry Sky!" Yang Yan’s face flashed with pride. Her slender throat lifted slightly as a calm, noble aura spread out. Such a temperament should never have belonged to a timid, faint-hearted woman, yet now it appeared utterly natural, as if Yang Yan had been born with it, causing those who faced her to feel abashed and instinctively small.

Even experts of the Void King Realm might not necessarily possess such bearing.

Yang Kai’s eyelids tightened. He inclined his head slightly, a twitch at the corner of his mouth, then his figure blurred and he vanished from where he stood; when he reappeared, he was already in front of Yang Yan.

Under her stunned gaze, Yang Kai hooked a finger and flicked it hard on her forehead.

With a soft thud, Yang Yan cried out, clutching her brow. A mist of tears dimmed her beautiful eyes; she looked at Yang Kai with injured resentment. The lofty, noble aura seemed shattered by that single finger and vanished without a trace.

"You call yourself Starry Sky Emperor, do you?" Yang Kai ground his teeth as he stared at her, then seized her cheek and dragged it hard to one side.

"What are you doing?" Yang Yan seemed bewildered; her mouth was pulled out of shape, her words slurred.

"You tell me what I’m doing," Yang Kai sneered, his grip tightening.

"Let go of me." Yang Yan cried, glaring at Yang Kai. "Let go at once — don’t think I won’t strike back. When my true body awakens, I’ll make you pay!"

"Your true body will awaken, huh?" Yang Kai reached out with his other hand and pinched the opposite cheek; Yang Yan’s expression twisted into a mix of anger and amusement as she clawed and thrashed at him like a lawless wretch, but Yang Kai remained unmoved and continued his rough teasing.

Tears welling in her eyes, Yang Yan began to cry.

Suddenly Yang Kai’s expression changed; he turned his head and looked into the distance. At the same time Yang Yan stopped moving. They exchanged a glance, and in the next instant both vanished from where they stood.

Their Divine Sense probes found that countless people were rapidly approaching from all directions, evidently drawn by the prior heavenly anomaly.

About the time it took to drink half a cup of tea after Yang Kai and Yang Yan disappeared, a dozen or so beams of different-colored light came flying from various directions. When they arrived at the perimeter of the Flowing Flame Sandland and saw the scene, each person was dumbstruck, faces written with incredulity.

The Heat-Flame Zone that had existed on the Dark Star for tens of thousands of years had actually vanished; the warriors unconsciously rubbed their eyes to be sure they were not seeing things.

To their shock, the First Layer Heat-Flame Zone had indeed gone in such an eerie fashion.

For a time everyone’s hearts were shaken. They hurriedly took out their Transmission Compasses and sent messages outward, and as time passed more and more warriors rushed to the place, all looking around in bewilderment.

When a hundred or so warriors had gathered, they held a brief council and decided to explore inward; after all, the disappearance of the First Layer's Heat-Flame Zone meant the Second Layer's heaven-and-earth treasure area was unobstructed — there might be great gains within.

To their disappointment, after days of searching no one found anything in the original Second Layer's heaven-and-earth treasure area. The spiritual herbs and wondrous medicines that should have been there had vanished along with the Heat-Flame Zone, leaving no trace of where they had gone.

By the time those people penetrated into the Second Layer's heaven-and-earth treasure area, Yang Kai and Yang Yan had already advanced to the towering mountain range before the Fourth Stage.

Their deep incursion was not due to Yang Kai using the Star Emperor Token, but rather Yang Yan’s guidance clearing the way ahead.

Strangely, the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone was far more potent than the first, yet when Yang Yan passed, the heat waves and flames parted as if of their own volition, as if they possessed intellect and dared not obstruct her.

Throughout their advance they encountered no danger.

Gazing at the jade pavilions half-hidden in the mists, Yang Yan showed a trace of nostalgia: "Those are the Taixuan Sect ruins."

"Taixuan Sect ruins?" Yang Kai arched a brow and turned to ask her, "Does it relate to you?"

"In one sense yes, in another sense no." Yang Yan’s dark brows knit slightly.

"Explain."

"It was a sect Starry Sky Emperor once casually aided."

"But aren’t you Starry Sky Emperor?" Yang Kai quirked a smile.

Yang Yan snorted, "I am me; Starry Sky Emperor is Starry Sky Emperor. We are related, but I cannot represent the Emperor."

"Oh?" Yang Kai’s interest deepened. He had never doubted Yang Yan’s words — indeed he had suspected long ago some connection between the Flowing Flame Sandland and Starry Sky Emperor; otherwise he would not have found a Star Emperor Token in the pavilion on the Sixth Layer.

At the very moment the Imperial Garden emerged, Yang Yan also fell into a deep coma. When Yang Kai attempted to awaken her Divine Sense, he witnessed countless inconceivable scenes within her Sea of Consciousness.

Now she had easily led him into the Flowing Flame Sandland; combining these clues, Yang Yan’s claim to be Starry Sky Emperor was not entirely unbelievable.

Despite the unease and hesitation in his heart, Yang Kai chose to trust Yang Yan.

After a long silence Yang Yan said, "Have you ever heard of Soul Incarnation?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

"I am a Soul Incarnation of the Emperor. For certain reasons the Emperor’s true body still sleeps. The paths of forging and array-craft I wield were all inherited from the Emperor."

"Why is the true body asleep?" Yang Kai lifted a brow. He was not particularly curious about the Soul Incarnation; he himself possessed a Soul Incarnation, gleaned from the Golden Blood of the Great Demon God. That Soul Incarnation had once been forced into a constructed Space Array by the Ghost Ancestor when they were on the Floating Continent to spy; its Yuan Qi was grievously wounded and it nearly perished.

But after years of nurturing that Soul Incarnation had long since recovered and grown even stronger than before.

It was only that Yang Kai had never found a vessel to deploy that Soul Incarnation.

"It seems wounded," Yang Yan said in a startling tone.

"The Emperor can be wounded?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"Why not? The Emperor has enemies, and those enemies' strength is not inferior to hers. The memories inherited from the true body are somewhat fragmented; I only recalled them after coming here. It seems that after a great battle the Emperor fell into slumber — tens of thousands of years have passed since. My strength is too low to retrieve more; only by growing stronger can I call forth those memories one by one."

"And that enemy?" Yang Kai asked.

"Probably dead," Yang Yan replied uncertainly.

"Then this ring…" Yang Kai looked thoughtfully at the crimson ring on her wrist.

"One ring of the Three Flames Ring; it is an Imperial Secret Treasure, which is why I could claim it," Yang Yan said with a faint smile. "The Third Layer's and the Fifth Layer's Heat-Flame Zones are formed from the Three Flames Ring. Sadly my strength is insufficient to fully command them for now; even from the first ring I cannot yet unleash great power."

Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart. He had dared to roughhouse Yang Yan earlier because he had grown used to her company and did not feel unfamiliar, but were the Emperor’s true body here, Yang Kai suspected he would not even dare to move an inch.

Imperial Might is formidable; one could not lightly offend such a being.

Moreover, the Three Flames Ring was nothing more than an Imperial Secret Treasure; scattered here it became a forbidden place on the Dark Star — how mighty must the Emperor’s own divine arts be?

A being like that could be wounded; who could possibly be her enemy?

Yang Kai was further staggered to learn that the Emperor famed across the Star Domain was, in fact, a woman.

If such a secret were to spread, countless men would be shamed to death.

Yet with this revelation Yang Kai’s thoughts cleared.

No wonder when the Flowing Flame Sandland closed a delicate female jade palm would appear, and in the Imperial Garden Yang Kai had seen that same Delicate Jade Palm a second time — perhaps it was an art left by the Emperor. After all, whether the Flowing Flame Sandland or the Imperial Garden, strictly speaking they were possessions of the Emperor.

With the Emperor’s divine prowess, accomplishing such deeds would not be extraordinary.
