## Chapter 1062 — I Advise You to Give Up

Zong Ao never intended to hoard such an enormous windfall for himself from start to finish.

This was where the Hengluo Commerce Guild had made their discovery; Rainfall Star is the guild’s cultivation star. Relying on that status, he had strong-armed others and kept eighty percent of the Profound Yin Moon Water already—any more and he wouldn’t dare promise that Halika and the others wouldn’t turn on him.

He had no guarantee he could handle so many experts whose strength surpassed his own.

So he wisely backed down a step, leaving ten drops of Profound Yin Moon Water behind!

When Halika and the others heard Zong Ao’s words, their expressions lit up with excitement. They clasped their fists and said, “Many thanks, Grandmaster! Though the Five-Colored Meteor Essence is rare, we should still be able to find some.”

“Hm, move quickly—who knows if these drops of Profound Yin Moon Water will suddenly fall and seep into the earth.” Zong Ao waved his hand, cradled the vessel, and walked out.

Halika dared not delay either; only the middle-aged woman was left behind to keep watch. He and Lin Mufeng went ahead, departing swiftly—clearly to search the branch’s stores for the hidden Five-Colored Meteor Essence.

Yang Kai followed silently at Zong Ao’s heels, leaving the ancient ruin with him.

The two returned to the valley palace by Star Shuttle.

In the side room, Xue Yue still slept peacefully just as she had when Yang Kai left earlier. Yang Kai checked on her, found nothing unexpected, then went to look for Zong Ao.

Having obtained a treasure like Profound Yin Moon Water, Zong Ao was unusually exhilarated. When Yang Kai arrived, he found Zong Ao raging through the Alchemy Room, venting his excitement by frenetically refining pills.

Dozens of pill furnaces had Saint Yuan poured into them by Zong Ao and hummed. One by one, wondrous spirit formations were drawn into being by his hand and set within the furnaces; herbs flew out of his Spatial Ring like snowflakes. He rapidly condensed the medicines into liquids and tossed them into the furnaces.

Yang Kai was moved, his eyes widening at the astonishing sight.

He had never imagined anyone could be so mad with pill refinement—one man working dozens of furnaces at once, crafting dozens of Pills simultaneously!

In that moment he finally understood how Zong Ao could produce so many Pills for the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

From his technique and fluency, it was clear Zong Ao had not reached this level overnight; he had likely always refined Pills with such earth-shattering methods.

Yang Kai possessed Divine Sense Fire and mastery of various lost spirit formations, giving him innate advantages in pillcraft, but he admitted to himself he could never reach Zong Ao’s peerless level.

He alone could at most handle four or five furnaces before reaching his limit.

There are always greater people and higher heavens! Yang Kai felt enlightened and stood in reverence at the door, eyes fixed on Zong Ao’s hands, missing no detail.

Zong Ao did not push him away; he busied himself as excitement flushed his face. One exquisite spirit formation after another was etched by his Saint Yuan and driven into different furnaces. The varied formations meshed perfectly, forming complex composite spirit formations that took effect within each furnace—catalyzing and aiding the refinements.

Everything proceeded in orderly, practiced fashion—without the slightest mistake.

After a good half day, different fragrances of Pills wafted through the Alchemy Room, mingling into a heady perfume that lifted the spirit and invigorated one as if an enlightening draught had been poured down the throat.

Yang Kai’s gaze only sharpened.

“Up!” Zong Ao barked, and dozens of furnaces trembled in unison as Pills of various colors shot from them like raindrops, falling into the prepared jade bottles.

Zong Ao tossed a restorative Pill into his mouth to slowly restore his strength, then hurried to the jade flasks, lifted them, and began checking them one by one.

After a long while, he finished inspecting them and said, dissatisfied: “Hmph, only two—Pills are damn hard to refine!”

Saying that, he pocketed the two Pills that bore Pill Patterns and casually tossed the rest aside.

This scene felt familiar; Yang Kai had seen it before when he and Xue Yue came to find Zong Ao. Feeling a stir in his chest, he asked, “Senior, do you refine Pills this way to raise the chance of Pill Patterns appearing?”

Zong Ao turned and sat in his chair, grinning and nodding lightly: “You have some eye for it, boy. Right—this is precisely why I labor so hard: to raise the odds of Pill Patterns showing up!”

He paused, then added: “Pill Patterns are a matter of chance. Even the top pillmasters cannot guarantee a Pill will form Pill Patterns. Only when a pillmaster’s skill is refined does the probability increase for lower-grade Pills. I’ve studied Pill Patterns for centuries; it was only a hundred years ago that I thought of this brute-force method of quantity over quality. Otherwise, why would I refuse any fee and refine for the Hengluo Commerce Guild for free? Hmph—what I want is for them to provide the ingredients; otherwise why would I let them take such a great advantage?”

Refining Pills in Zong Ao’s manner consumed Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine in enormous quantities. Without a wealthy backing power, it could not be sustained for long.

As for the Hengluo Commerce Guild, being the wealthiest in the Star Domain, it was naturally the best choice. Zong Ao’s decision to cooperate with the Hengluo Commerce Guild brought tremendous benefits to both sides.

“How has your research progressed, Senior?” Yang Kai asked with interest.

Zong Ao sighed lightly: “Hard—so hard! The longer you stay in this trade, the harder Pills become to refine. Don’t laugh, boy, I can only maintain a success rate of two out of a hundred—sometimes even less—for Pills above Saint King-Grade.”

Two in a hundred—meaning out of one hundred Pills he might produce only two that bore Pill Patterns.

That rate seems low, but across the entire pill-refining world it is a staggering figure.

Many pillmasters spend their lives and only in the luckiest times can they produce one or two Pills with Pill Patterns.

Yet Zong Ao, in nearly every batch, almost always obtained one. It was rare for him to be so unlucky as to produce none.

“I’ve even refined a few Saint King-Grade Pills with Pill Cloud,” Zong Ao said proudly, flaunting his success. “Want to see?”

Pill Patterns are hard; Pill Cloud is even harder!

Over the years he had collected thousands of Pills bearing Pill Patterns, but those with Pill Cloud were only a handful—treasures he would take out to inspect whenever his mood soured, cheering himself up at once.

He had lived here alone for nearly a hundred years. Without his obsession to delve into profound pillcraft, even someone of his strength would have gone mad from the tedium.

Now that Yang Kai had come to keep him company, and looked satisfactory in his eyes, Zong Ao was naturally eager to show off.

“I won’t covet your treasures, Senior!” Yang Kai would not let him flaunt them, which left Zong Ao a little disappointed. He curled his mouth in displeasure: “Ignorant brat, such a chance and you won’t seize it—looks like your achievements in pillcraft are destined to be limited!”

Pills with Pill Patterns were rare in the world. In the refining world, no matter the grade—even Earth-Grade or Mystery-Grade—such Pills were treasures; a talented pillmaster might glean insights from studying them.

Not to mention Zong Ao’s handful of Pills with Pill Cloud, which were of Saint King-Grade! They were the fruits of a century of toil—his greatest achievement—and he would not casually show them.

Today, having brought them up only to be refused by Yang Kai, Zong Ao felt his warm invitation slapped coldly aside; his good mood was instantly ruined, and he naturally gave Yang Kai a sour face.

He did not know that back on Tongxuan Continent he had already refined Pills that produced Pill Cloud, and that both Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang had, when refining Pills, a far greater chance of producing Pill Patterns than he did.

“Senior, I’ve brought you the Profound Yin Moon Water; you’ve profited greatly—shouldn’t you now tell me how to save my Lady?” Yang Kai ignored Zong Ao’s sour expression and raised the earlier bargain.

“Hmph! A lecher who loves beauty!” Zong Ao muttered in displeasure—he clearly thought Yang Kai had a deep infatuation with Xue Yue—yet trade was trade, and Zong Ao still kept his promise. After musing he said, “To save her, you only need to refine one Purple Heart Resuscitation Pill!”

After saying this, he looked at Yang Kai with schadenfreude, as if waiting for him to be crushed.

“Purple Heart Resuscitation Pill?” Yang Kai frowned and thought rapidly.

When Zong Ao earlier went to find someone to craft the container for the Profound Yin Moon Water, he had perused the palace’s tomes and recorded many pill prescriptions; the Purple Heart Resuscitation Pill was among them.

He pondered, recalling the pill’s grade and the ingredients required.

“A Void King-Grade Pill?” Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically as he cried out.

“Of course a Void King-Grade Pill!” Zong Ao chuckled oddly. “Profound Yin Moon Water is a cultivation treasure—you think its harm is so easily remedied? Only a Void King-Grade Purple Heart Resuscitation Pill can lift that girl’s calamity. You should know better than anyone: not only is her vitality frozen, her Spirit Body has scattered and is nowhere to be found. This is not something easily cured.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned grim.

Zong Ao continued: “Boy, I advise you to give up. How many can refine a Void King-Grade Pill in this entire Star Domain? As for the materials, you can’t even gather them—where are you going to find a Resurrection Soul-Gathering Flower of ten-thousand-year maturity? Such things can’t exist in this Star Domain.”

Resurrection Soul-Gathering Flower is not the rarest of herbs; each cultivation star will produce some, but to refine a Purple Heart Resuscitation Pill requires one of ten-thousand-year age. Where are you to find such a thing? It’s impossible for the entire Star Domain.
