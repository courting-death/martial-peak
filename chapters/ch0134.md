## Chapter 134 — Pursuit

“Yang Kai, hurry up and come over here to kowtow and apologize to Senior Brother Jie!” A furious roar echoed from the distance.

“Yang Kai, Senior Brother Jie is unwilling to argue with you, but that doesn’t mean we, your senior brothers, will forgive you. If you do not apologize today, you will become our enemy from now on! We will no longer regard you as our junior brother!” 

“Yes! This junior brother is truly shameless. With such low strength, he dares to covet what he cannot have, overestimating himself. He should take a good look in the mirror and see what kind of person he is.” Not only did the senior brothers shout, but even one of the senior sisters joined the fray, her voice sharp and piercing like a shrew.

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent, allowing their words to blow past him like the wind, unmoved.

Lan Chudie tugged at Yang Kai again and whispered, “Junior Brother, don’t be stubborn. A real man can bend and stretch; isn’t it just an apology? It’s nothing serious.”

Yang Kai turned his head and looked at Lan Chudie with a calm gaze.

That indifferent look made Lan Chudie’s heart skip a beat, and she frowned, “What’s wrong?”

“Don’t tell me you don’t know Jie Hongchen’s true intentions. Don’t tell me you can’t imagine what kind of treatment I will receive after I go over there,” Yang Kai’s voice turned slightly cold.

Lan Chudie was annoyed, “How would I know about your matters?”

“Though we are senior and junior siblings, we have shared hardships these past few days. But we have no deep bond; you don’t need to feel guilty for leaving me behind. You go your way; my matters are none of your concern.”

Lan Chudie was struck at her core, her complexion paling as she angrily retorted, “How can you be so ungrateful?”

Stamping her foot, Lan Chudie ignored Yang Kai and walked towards Jie Hongchen. After taking a few steps, she stopped and turned back, saying, “I owe you nothing; don’t act so high and mighty!”

With that, she left without looking back.

On the side of Lingxiao Pavilion, the verbal assault on Yang Kai never ceased. Jie Hongchen wore a cold smile, watching Yang Kai with satisfaction, exuding an air of superiority as if looking down on the masses from the clouds.

In this situation, no matter what choice Yang Kai made, it was something he was pleased to see.

Want to join their ranks to protect yourself? Fine! Just come over and admit your mistakes. Kneel and kowtow!

Unwilling to do so? That’s fine too! Go and wander alone in this perilous Inheritance Celestial Cave! Let’s see how long you can survive!

Jie Hongchen didn’t know what kind of choice to expect from Yang Kai.

While waiting, Yang Kai’s cold voice came from the distance, “A group of ignorant fools who only know how to cling to the powerful and look up to the high! Yang does not wish to accompany you!”

Lan Chudie, who was heading towards Jie Hongchen, paused upon hearing this. She felt as if Yang Kai’s words were directed at her, a wave of humiliation and discomfort surging within her.

But soon, Lan Chudie became infuriated! How had she been clinging to the powerful? In this dangerous place, it was only natural to walk with those stronger for safety; was she supposed to risk her life alongside a junior brother at the Seventh Stage of the Open Origin Realm? If you don’t recognize your own worth, don’t blame others. If you have the ability, then raise your strength; naturally, people will gather around you, and at that time, even senior sisters will support you.

I’ve tried to persuade you before; I’m not truly abandoning you. This is the path you chose; how can you blame me? With such thoughts, Lan Chudie felt increasingly wronged. However, her guilt towards Yang Kai lessened considerably.

In the forest, Yang Kai’s figure gradually faded into the darkness.

Yet that one sentence was like adding salt to boiling water, and Nie Yong, eager to stir up trouble, shouted, “Yang Kai, how dare you speak to your senior brothers and sisters like that? You think you can just leave? Stay right there!”

As he spoke, he threw a punch towards the direction Yang Kai had departed.

With a loud bang, a burst of flames erupted in the darkness. Yang Kai’s cold face flashed momentarily.

Yang Kai’s icy voice followed, “Jie Hongchen, you know very well what you have done. Sooner or later, I will settle the score with you!”

Upon hearing this, Jie Hongchen’s expression darkened.

He naturally understood what Yang Kai was referring to, which was the incident where he had someone inform Long Hui about Yang Kai. At that time, Jie Hongchen had thought Long Hui would surely eliminate Yang Kai without fail. But unexpectedly, he had failed.

After Yang Kai returned to Lingxiao Pavilion a few days ago, Jie Hongchen had been on edge for several days. He wasn’t afraid of Yang Kai, but he was afraid of Meng Wuya, as they had all returned to Lingxiao Pavilion together.

However, Meng Wuya had not come to trouble him, leading Jie Hongchen to believe he had acted discreetly without exposing any flaws.

Hearing Yang Kai’s words today, he realized that the matter had been exposed.

Killing intent surged! Jie Hongchen quickly signaled Nie Yong with his eyes.

Nie Yong, delighted at the opportunity, had just wanted to spy on Lan Chudie and Du Yishuang but had been exposed by Yang Kai. Filled with hatred, he now had Jie Hongchen’s silent approval and angrily shouted, “You’ve gone too far! Yang Kai, how dare you speak to Senior Brother Jie like that? Let me teach you a lesson!”

He raised his arm and called out, “Which senior brother will join me to vent Senior Brother Jie’s anger!”

Several figures shot out alongside Nie Yong.

Lan Chudie reached out, wanting to say something, but swallowed her words, watching helplessly as those few people chased after Yang Kai into the forest.

On the other hand, Du Yishuang from Fengyu Tower, wanting to help Yang Kai, was stopped by Fang Ziqi.

“Senior Brother Fang, he saved me a few days ago!” Du Yishuang said urgently.

“Mind your own business!” 

“But…” 

Fang Ziqi shot her a cold glance and said to the two junior sisters beside him, “Keep an eye on her; don’t let her through.”

“Yes.” The two junior sisters quickly restrained Du Yishuang’s arms.

Fang Ziqi looked with interest in the direction Yang Kai had disappeared and then at Jie Hongchen’s side, softly saying, “Internal strife is happening here; Lingxiao Pavilion is really not much.”

Du Yishuang struggled desperately but could not break free from her two junior sisters. Zuo An, feeling pity, whispered, “Don’t worry. Although he is only at the Seventh Stage of the Open Origin Realm, he has given me a very dangerous feeling these past few days. Perhaps this time, it won’t be him who suffers!”

“Are you sure?” Du Yishuang stopped struggling and asked softly.

“I don’t know. It’s just a gut feeling.” Zuo An replied lightly. It was precisely because of this feeling that he had refrained from provoking Yang Kai these past few days.

In the forest, Yang Kai was sprinting, shadows closing in behind him, his clothes fluttering. Nie Yong’s voice came from behind, “Yang Kai, for the sake of our shared bond as fellow disciples, surrender quietly. It will spare you some suffering; otherwise, you will regret it!”

“Bond?” Yang Kai scoffed, “I have no bond with you!”

“Alright, alright. You said it.” Nie Yong’s expression turned furious as he shouted, “Brothers, this kid obtained a set of Upper-Level Earth-Grade martial arts a few days ago. Capture him and force him to reveal the cultivation method of that martial art, and we will all benefit!”

“What? Upper-Level Earth-Grade martial arts?” Someone exclaimed, their eyes immediately filled with greed. Although they had gained quite a bit during these past few days, the number of people gathered meant that the benefits were spread thin. Now hearing that Yang Kai had obtained a set of Upper-Level Earth-Grade martial arts, who wouldn’t be envious?

With profit in sight, the speed of those pursuing Yang Kai suddenly increased, closing the distance between them.

“Yang Kai, do you still want to resist?” one person shouted, swinging a sword that glimmered like flowing clouds, striking towards Yang Kai’s back.

Sensing the impending danger, Yang Kai hurriedly dodged, but his footing was unsteady. Another attack followed.

Rolling to evade the second strike, when Yang Kai stood up again, his expression turned cold.

He found himself surrounded by the five pursuers.

Aside from Nie Yong, there were four others! Although all five were at the Qi Movement Realm, their strength surpassed that of Nie Yong.

The five formed a circle, enclosing Yang Kai in the center, each of them sneering at him.

Nie Yong was especially pleased, looking at Yang Kai with malice, “Yang Junior Brother, you’ve ruined my good deed; did you ever think you would face this moment?”

“Peeping at women bathing is considered a good deed?” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Nie Yong’s face flushed; such a matter was indeed shameful. Even the four who had chased after him cast meaningful glances at him, making his face even more awkward.

One person on the left retracted his gaze and coughed lightly, “Yang Kai, you are our junior brother. We won’t take your life. Just obediently tell us the cultivation method of that martial art. We’ll take you back to see Senior Brother Jie and speak a few good words for you. Perhaps Senior Brother Jie will forgive you for this offense.”

“Thank you for your goodwill, Senior Brothers. I appreciate it.” Yang Kai felt the pressure from the five, his unyielding will and pride surging within him. His expression remained calm, “But if you want to take my things, come and get them with your own abilities!”

One person on the right shouted angrily, “You’re asking for it! Don’t think that just because we’re fellow disciples, we won’t do anything to you! Offending Senior Brother Jie means you have only one path ahead: death! Even if we kill you here, no one will stand up for you!”

Among the five, Nie Yong held a grudge against Yang Kai, so hearing this made his killing intent surge. He waved his hand, “Stop wasting words with him; we can still force him to reveal the cultivation method of that martial art even if we break him!”

Last time, when dividing the Little Stone Men, Nie Yong had only received a martial art that was useless to him, so he was naturally envious of Yang Kai’s gains. Although he didn’t know what Yang Kai had obtained, it was certainly more useful than his own.

As soon as he finished speaking, Nie Yong was the first to charge forward, a gust of wind swirling around his palm, carrying a dangerous aura as he attacked Yang Kai.

He was determined to keep Yang Kai here, and his first move was his strongest martial art.

Seeing Nie Yong make a move, the other four, feeling confident in their status, merely watched from the sidelines. After all, Yang Kai’s strength was too low; Nie Yong alone was enough.

Not only that, but one person even commented on Nie Yong’s technique, “Nie Junior Brother, your Clear Wind Palm is quite refined; it seems you’ve put in quite a bit of effort into this move.”

The other three nodded slightly, clearly agreeing with his words. The Clear Wind Palm was a Lower-Level Earth-Grade martial art, requiring five hundred Contribution Points to exchange for.

With a palm strike, the clear wind brushed past, killing the enemy without a trace. Nie Yong had spent considerable time and effort to obtain this technique.

Using such a move against a martial artist at the Open Origin Realm was undoubtedly like pinching an ant; there was no suspense. Everyone could almost imagine the scene of Yang Kai being defeated and injured.

Faced with such a palm strike, Yang Kai merely met it with a punch.
