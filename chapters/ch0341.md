## Chapter 341 — Another Encounter with Qi Deviation

Under the impetus of the three women, the power of the Five Dragon Seal was significantly enhanced compared to before. After all, Leng Shan was not weak, and the joint efforts of the Sisters from the Hu Family were formidable, beyond what the three from the Baoqi Sect could match.

The five dragons appeared, exhaling a white scorching light, illuminating the Soul Evil Spirit.

The Soul Evil Spirit was once again bound in place!

Knowing that the Five Dragon Seal could not hold it for long, Yang Kai acted decisively and without hesitation.

With both palms thrust out, the White Tiger Seal and the Divine Ox Seal flew forth. Accompanied by the roar of the tiger and the bellow of the ox, two beast souls composed of True Yang Primordial Qi ferociously tore at it.

One hand wielded a sword in a fierce slash, while the other unleashed the Triple Flame Yang Explosion, relentlessly assaulting the Soul Evil Spirit.

The soul attack unleashed upon it was utterly disregarded!

Everyone watched, their faces twitching!

Such a combat style was devastatingly ferocious, giving the impression of wanting to perish alongside the enemy. The body of the Soul Evil Spirit dimmed rapidly, yet its spirit techniques visibly surged into Yang Kai's mind in an unending stream.

The reason why True Essence Realm martial artists found themselves helpless against the Soul Evil Spirit was precisely due to their inability to defend against its souls technique!

Even Divine Roaming Realm experts would find it quite a task to evade such assaults, making the Soul Evil Spirit a troublesome existence within the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

However, if one could ignore its soul attacks, it was merely stronger than the average evil spirit.

The pain in Yang Kai’s mind intensified. Blue veins stood out on his forehead, but his hands showed no signs of pausing. Amid the piercing wails of the Soul Evil Spirit, he continued to wear down its body.

The old man watched for a while, his eyes, which were previously gleaming with light, trembled slightly.

He had never anticipated that Yang Kai would be so ferocious. The young man, only at the fifth stage of True Essence Realm, displayed a depth of strength and combat power that exceeded his imagination.

At this rate, he really might be able to kill the Soul Evil Spirit, and… it wouldn’t take long!

Thinking this, the old man quietly shifted his attention to this side.

Sure enough, after half a tea's time of fierce battle, the Soul Evil Spirit, amidst a series of wails, transformed into spots of purple light and collapsed into nothingness.

Seeing Yang Kai’s tremendous power, the people from Ghost King Valley and the Baoqi Sect couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief, while the Sisters from the Hu Family were so astonished that they covered their mouths, their eyes trembling.

Where the Soul Evil Spirit had disappeared, a large mass of crystal-clear, pure white essence, resembling cotton, remained. This mass of essence contained visible silk threads.

Before anyone could celebrate Yang Kai's victory, they were startled by this mass of essence. Everyone exclaimed, "Special Essence!"

The old man’s already bright eyes suddenly shone even more, greed filling them as he stared at the source!

Special Essence was more precious than ordinary evil spirit essence. Nobody knew what kind of wonders were hidden within it. However, as the old man gazed at this special essence, he distinctly felt his divine sense being subtly attracted, as if it had caught the scent of blood, igniting a primal desire!

In an instant, the old man understood: this special essence was capable of enhancing the power of divine sense.

After all, it was something left behind by the Soul Evil Spirit upon its demise, so it was only natural for it to augment divine sense.

Suddenly, the old man felt immense greed!

Were it ordinary essence, he wouldn’t have been tempted, but items that could enhance divine sense were rare enough to warrant taking risks to seize.

Without a shred of hesitation, the old man hastily shouted to Yu Qing, "Guard this place!"

The next moment, he shot towards Yang Kai like a shooting star.

"You shameless old man!" Shen Yi shouted in anger.

"Yang Kai, be careful!" cries of alarm erupted.

Yang Kai was dizzy and on the verge of collapse. Although assisted by the Warm Spirit Lotus, he had suffered significant damage from enduring multiple soul attacks. After defeating the Soul Evil Spirit, he didn’t even glance at what essence it had left behind. He was solely focused on taking a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye from the black book space and putting it into his mouth.

Hearing the cries, Yang Kai instinctively mobilized all his True Essence and seized the evil spirit essence before him, operating his cultivation method to absorb it into his palm, causing it to vanish from sight.

"Courting death!" The old man, at this moment, had no more pretense. Having already torn his mask with Yang Kai's group, he saw no need to pretend to be a good man. A pained and furious expression crossed his face as he violently swung down at Yang Kai's head.

A furious strike from a fifth-stage Divine Roaming Realm expert would certainly be overwhelming! Even if Yang Kai exerted all his strength to defend, he was still unable to counter it!

He could only manage to force out a drop of Yang Liquid, forming a shield to block above him.

Bang…

With a loud crash, Yang Kai was struck by the old man, plummeting like a meteor and directly crashing into the slowly rising evil spring, disappearing from sight!

The old man was left stunned in the air, mumbling curses and casting a regretful sigh before turning back.

He had still failed to seize that special evil spirit essence.

"Yang Kai!" Hu Mei’er’s face turned pale, appearing as if she had lost her soul. Without any hesitation, she dashed off the high platform, plunging toward the spot where Yang Kai had fallen.

However, just as she descended a foot, someone grabbed her.

Turning around, she saw her sister frantically shaking her head in alarm.

"Let me go…" Hu Mei’er pleaded, gazing at her sister, speaking softly.

Hu Jiao’er continued to shake her head, her eyes gradually reddening.

Since cultivating the Consonant Spirit Technique, the two sisters had gradually developed a shared consciousness. How could Hu Jiao’er not feel her sister’s sorrow and helplessness at this moment?

Because of this empathy, Hu Jiao’er felt her heart ache, but she could not bear to see her sister jump down to seek death.

The high platform fell into silence, with the people of Ghost King Valley and the Baoqi Sect left in shock.

They had never expected that old man to be so despicable.

Moments later, Leng Shan suddenly cried out sharply, "Attack!"

As she spoke, she turned her head, her beautiful eyes filled with unyielding fury and madness, her hand raising to unleash the Ghost King Seal.

The sharp, howling ghost face seal aggressively attacked the other high platform.

As she made her move, everyone from the Ghost King Valley unleashed their martial skills, and the people from the Baoqi Sect hurriedly summoned their treasures, all aiming their assaults at the old man and the Xiaoyao Sect.

In an effort to avoid damaging the True Yang Primordial Qi barrier, everyone vented their fury at the incident.

The high platform was already surrounded by enemies, and with the fierce onslaught from the Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect, the situation became even more precarious.

Yu Qing's expression changed significantly as he panicked, "Leng Shan! Are you attacking my Xiaoyao Sect personnel too? Ghost King Valley and Xiaoyao Sect are neighbors, and besides, we haven't targeted that kid. Can you please be more discerning?!"

Leng Shan's eyes were cold and merciless. She ignored Yu Qing's shouts, pouring her True Essence with abandon.

"Brats, how dare you!" The old man was furious. He realized he had underestimated this group of young people. In their fury, the attacks they unleashed were quite sharp. A couple wouldn't have mattered, but with so many striking together, along with the surrounding evil spirits, he suddenly found himself flustered, feeling overwhelmed.

Especially with the several treasures that had been summoned, their tremendous power made his complexion drastically change.

"If you do not cease your attack, I will, even at the cost of being buried with you, destroy your barrier!" The old man roared. As a fifth-stage Divine Roaming Realm expert, he wouldn’t make such a pressuring statement unless he was pushed to the edge.

Within, he secretly regretted not seizing the evil spirit essence earlier and felt it was a mistake to have ruthlessly targeted that kid. Even a cornered rabbit would bite back; how much more so this rowdy group of youths?

"Wait, stop attacking!" Tao Yang suddenly exclaimed, his eyes lighting up as he looked down below, joyfully calling out, "Brother Yang isn't dead!"

Everyone froze, their True Essence abruptly calming as they followed Tao Yang's gaze. Below, they indeed saw a hazy figure in the evil spring, emitting a flickering light.

It was Yang Kai, who not only hadn’t died but was now quietly standing in that evil spring.

The scattered evil spirit essence around him seemed to be drawn by an invisible force, surging into Yang Kai's body and disappearing.

"Brother Yang…" Tao Yang called out urgently.

"Hehe…" From within the boiling spring, Yang Kai’s low chuckle echoed, sending chills down everyone's spines.

Gradually, the laughter grew louder, becoming thunderous.

"Brother Yang… what’s wrong with you?" Tao Yang asked, his expression changing as he nervously scanned below.

Suddenly, from below, a pitch-black aura erupted from Yang Kai’s body. Even submerged in the evil spring, this blackness was remarkably visible, like a black hole. When it appeared, it instantly swallowed all light, leaving everyone momentarily blinded.

When they came to their senses again, they beheld a shadow of pure darkness below, with only a pair of crimson eyes gleaming with a chilling bloodlust.

"Qi Deviation!" the old man screeched, believing that after Yang Kai had absorbed so much evil spirit essence, he hadn’t had the time to refine it and had been corrupted by the malice within.

Such an explanation seemed reasonable. After all, even an experienced individual like the old man would find it hard to withstand the instant influx of so many sources, though Yang Kai’s cultivation method and True Essence were known to restrain evil spirits, it was feared he wouldn’t escape calamity.

At his words, the relief felt by everyone on the high platform transformed abruptly into dread.

Leng Shan's gaze flickered as she suspiciously looked down, feeling uncertain in her heart.

Among those present, only she knew that Yang Kai could harness a different kind of evil energy that was distinct from True Yang Primordial Qi.

Back when they were in another location, she and Zi Mo had also thought that Yang Kai had experienced Qi Deviation, only to experience considerable embarrassment afterward. At that time, he was enveloped in darkness just as he was now, only this time it appeared even more severe.

Was he truly experiencing Qi Deviation? Leng Shan questioned herself internally, but couldn’t grasp the answer.

"Mei’er, go up! I’m fine!" Yang Kai’s voice emanated from below, cold yet eerily calm.

Hearing this, Leng Shan’s expression suddenly brightened, knowing that Yang Kai truly was unharmed.

Hu Mei’er also froze for a moment, but Hu Jiao’er quickly pulled her up, and the two sisters hurriedly took cover within the barrier, casting astonished glances down below.
