## Chapter 2097 — Sudden Cataclysm

Under the watching eyes of everyone, Jiang Taisheng's body suddenly ballooned, and in the blink of an eye he became a fat, bloated man; his clothes shredded to rags.

An unsettling fluctuation of energy poured out from his body, making every heart in the crowd race.

The Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation flashed wildly, faintly showing signs that it could not hold.

“Stop him!” Hua Qingsi's voice no longer carried the thousand charms she had earlier; she screamed, and terror filled her beautiful eyes.

Though she was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, she could not simply ignore a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert's self-destruction, and besides, Jiang Taisheng was a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm who had been demonized!

The man surnamed Fu likewise looked grim; a short knife appeared in his hand and he slashed directly at Jiang Taisheng, intending to kill him before the self-destruction could occur.

Duan Yuanshan, Qin Chaoyang, Du Lishen, and Yang Kai all joined forces, directing multicolored energy attacks toward Jiang Taisheng.

But at that moment, something no one could have expected happened.

Zhuang Pan suddenly let out a terrified roar, his eyes trembling violently, and then he desperately ran outward.

He was so frightened by what he saw that he only wanted to flee as far as possible, completely forgetting the great vow against inner demons they had all sworn together, and no longer caring about the safety of the others.

With his movement, the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation that might have still held instantly collapsed without any external attack; the colossal Black Tortoise silhouette wavered and dissolved in a twist.

“Bastard!” Duan Yuanshan glanced at Zhuang Pan's fleeing back and nearly spat a mouthful of blood.

“Brother Zhuang, come back!” Du Lishen shouted. But Zhuang Pan had fled and vanished; he could no longer hear them.

Boom……

A tremendous blast roared out, the earth trembled, and where Jiang Taisheng had stood a dark, pitch-black hole suddenly appeared—devoid of any light, unfathomably deep, as if it could swallow all things.

That black hole instantly expanded outward, carrying a chilling surge of energy.

Pfft pfft pfft……

Duan Yuanshan bore the brunt of it and sprayed a cloud of blood; his breath withered considerably.

Immediately after, the man surnamed Fu and Hua Qingsi both went pale, blood spilling from their mouths and noses; fortunately their strength and secret arts were formidable, and by relying on their powerful cultivation and techniques they managed to stand their ground and block most of the damage.

Qin Chaoyang and Du Lishen, the weakest among them, suffered the worst; Qin Chaoyang was blasted away and fell to the ground far off, his life unknown.

Du Lishen had half his body blown away by Jiang Taisheng's self-destruction and fell unconscious on the spot.

On the other side, Yang Kai guarded behind Qin Yu, turning his back toward Jiang Taisheng and stirring Origin Qi to protect himself.

Qin Yu only possessed the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and bore the heavy duty of repairing the seal; if she died, the whole operation would be a complete failure.

So Yang Kai's first thought was to protect Qin Yu.

When that terrifying energy impact struck, even though Yang Kai used space techniques to dispel most of the force, it still felt as if a great hammer had struck him; his back burned like fire, Qi and blood churned in his chest, and he spat a mouthful of golden blood.

As the aftershock subsided, the scene was a grisly sight.

Everyone was gasping for breath, faces full of shock.

An ordinary First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert's self-destruction would never possess such terrifying power; Jiang Taisheng could reach this point only because he had been demonized.

“Yu'er, how is the seal repair going?” Duan Yuanshan suddenly turned to Qin Yu and demanded amid the silence.

At this moment, of the seven Dao Origin Realm cultivators, one had fled, one lay dead, and another’s fate was unknown — they could no longer form the great formation. If the seal’s repair was finished, everyone could withdraw at once to Fenglin City; if only a little remained, Duan Yuanshan thought they could push on a bit longer, but if much was still lacking, they would have no choice but to flee immediately.

When he asked, everyone turned their gazes to Qin Yu.

The next moment, their expressions froze and despair showed on their faces.

For the sealing stone wall looked even more battered than before, clearly affected by the earlier self-destruction, and now a faint golden light shimmered at the seal; the wormlike lines writhed and crawled as if they were devouring some life force and were about to become living things.

Moreover, from the stone wall came a strange pull that made people reluctant to avert their eyes.

Sensing this, the group was horrified and hurriedly bit their tongues, closing their eyes in the brief moment their minds were still clear.

“This is no place to linger—everyone go!” Duan Yuanshan knew the situation had turned; he leapt to Qin Chaoyang's side, reached out to test his breath, and when he confirmed he was still alive he cheered and hauled him up.

The man surnamed Fu and Hua Qingsi exchanged a look and both felt the urge to retreat.

“Junior Brother, move!” Hua Qingsi shouted to Yang Kai, who stood there, sounding as if she greatly cared for him.

“Sir Yang's condition seems off.” Qin Yu called out in a choked voice.

She had been sheltered behind Yang Kai and was uninjured; it was Yang Kai who had been struck by that terrifying energy and whose golden blood had been spat onto the sealing stone wall.

Qin Yu had seen it clearly; when Yang Kai's golden blood hit the stone wall, the entire wall altered, filled with vitality and a strange demonic power.

She even vaguely felt that Yang Kai now shared some inexplicable connection with the seal on that stone wall.

“What is it?” Hua Qingsi asked in alarm.

“I can't explain it either.” Qin Yu shook her head, staring blankly at Yang Kai.

Duan Yuanshan's face darkened as he darted over to Yang Kai, and in the next instant his expression changed sharply.

He saw Yang Kai's eyes wide open, golden blood trickling from the corner of his eyes, staring fixedly at the stone wall as if something had ensnared him; though his face showed struggle, he could not break free.

A pitch-black Demonic Qi suddenly surged from the seal and climbed onto Yang Kai like a black rope, binding him tightly to the stone wall.

Yang Kai's aura turned suddenly sinister, and strange, intricate black demon marks began to appear on the exposed flesh of his body.

“Demonization!” Duan Yuanshan whispered in horror.

Seeing this, he knew Yang Kai had already been corroded by Demonic Qi and would soon turn into the same kind of being as Jiang Taisheng.

With that thought, he did not hesitate; he drew Qin Yu to his side and used Origin Qi to wrap her and the unconscious Qin Chaoyang, then called to Hua Qingsi and the man surnamed Fu, “I will go ahead first.”

With those words he streaked toward Fenglin City like the wind and lightning.

He still had some remnants of power within him, enough to support his return to Fenglin City; once inside the city he could rely on the defensive formations to resist the Demonic Qi.

“What about Sir Yang?” Qin Yu called out in a panic.

Yang Kai had come to this state partly because of her; if he had not exposed his back to protect her, his golden blood would not have been spat onto the sealing stone wall.

Qin Yu could not stand idly by, but her strength was too low and she truly could not do anything.

“We can't deal with him.” Duan Yuanshan replied, his speed rapidly increasing, and in the blink of an eye he was gone.

On the other side, the man surnamed Fu and Hua Qingsi did not immediately withdraw; confident in their deep cultivation, they were not overly afraid of the Demonic Qi gathering around them, but both stared at Yang Kai with strange gazes.

After a moment the man surnamed Fu sneered coldly and said, “Boy, once Demonic Qi has invaded you, you are destined to become a demon; my killing you would be a righteous act.”

As he spoke, his short spear materialized again with a sound of slicing air and thrust straight for Yang Kai's head.

But at that moment Hua Qingsi suddenly raised a fair hand and sent a ribbonlike Secret Treasure flying out, which accurately wrapped the spear and prevented it from advancing an inch.

“You wench, what are you doing? Have you been invaded by Demonic Qi as well?” the man surnamed Fu shouted angrily, turning to demand.

Hua Qingsi smiled lightly and said, "Sir, do I look as if I've been corrupted by Demonic Qi?"

“Then why did you stop me?”

“This Junior Brother was just sharing life and death with us; you would kill him in the next breath—aren't you being a bit heartless?” Hua Qingsi sneered at the man surnamed Fu and taunted him, “You change face faster than flipping a book.”

“What affection do I have for trash like him?”

“You have none, but I do.” Hua Qingsi smiled sweetly, “I did say I'd look after him before; if you kill him in front of me, isn't that disrespectful to me?”

“This Lord should give you face? Who do you think you are?” the man surnamed Fu sneered with a sidelong glance. “Clear off at once, or don’t blame this Lord for showing you no mercy.”

"Oh my, I'm so scared," Hua Qingsi feigned, patting her heaving chest with trembling grace. "My lord, what are you so angry about? Anger is bad for your health—it will make you age faster."

“You wench… you've provoked me so many times; I did not wish to stoop to your level, but since you insist on courting death, don't blame me for crushing you like a flower. I'll kill you first!” the man surnamed Fu roared, his short spear shifting into eight identical copies that shrieked as they shot toward Hua Qingsi.

Facing such an attack, Hua Qingsi did not dare be careless; she formed a hand seal and suddenly a sprinkling of starlight rose within her, spreading like a sea of stars, and in the next moment dozens of arrows formed before her, each composed of gathered starlight.

Each arrow seemed drawn by an invisible bow, and in a flash they shot forward.

“Chasing Star Arrows!” Seeing this, the man surnamed Fu's face changed; while he controlled his Secret Treasure to counter these mystical attacks, he barked, “Are you from the Star God Palace?”

“Heh heh heh… and what if I am?” Hua Qingsi giggled, and with her hands clasped she formed a complex mystic pattern, then struck the man surnamed Fu across the head while crying out sharply, “Starfall!”
