## Chapter 156 — Qi Movement Realm

As Yang Kai opened his eyes, he was greeted by Su Yan's delighted smile. Her beautiful eyes sparkled as she playfully bit his shoulder.

"That tickles," Yang Kai chuckled, shaking his shoulder.

"I've discovered that you have a secret!" Su Yan said with a radiant smile.

"Has anyone ever told you that your smile can make the world lose its color?" Yang Kai gazed at her with a dreamy expression.

Su Yan's face flushed, and she tucked a few stray strands of hair behind her ear, whispering, "From now on, I will only smile for one person..."

Yang Kai felt a heavy sense of happiness wash over him.

"Let's cultivate first!" he said, his expression turning serious.

Su Yan nodded slightly.

Thirty drops of Yang Liquid were soon engulfed by Su Yan's icy energy. When they returned to Yang Kai's body, they were directly absorbed by his Proud Bone Golden Body.

This discovery brought joy to Yang Kai's heart.

The Yang Liquid was crucial for him, but the importance of the Proud Bone Golden Body was equally undeniable. The transformation between this primordial energy and power was something Yang Kai welcomed.

Just like before, he detonated another thirty drops of Yang Liquid, and surprisingly, the usual feeling of bloating did not occur. Furrowing his brows, Yang Kai detonated five more drops, and the familiar sensation of pressure and soreness finally returned.

The cultivation during that brief moment had widened his meridians significantly; otherwise, such an effect would have been impossible.

The Harmony Technique and Dual Cultivation Method were indeed powerful!

After the energy from these thirty-five drops of Yang Liquid was devoured and integrated back into his body, and subsequently absorbed by the Proud Bone Golden Body, Yang Kai's body trembled slightly. A sudden gust of wind swept through the hall, lifting the clothes scattered on the ground, and an invisible aura erupted from Yang Kai, creating visible ripples of energy that spread outward.

After a while, this anomaly gradually subsided.

He had broken through again! He was now at the ninth layer of the Open Origin Realm! It had been less than a day since his last breakthrough.

Su Yan noticed this as well, her delicate face radiating joy as she celebrated with him.

Yang Kai's mind was calm, yet he felt a hint of anticipation.

Could he break through to the Qi Movement Realm this time through dual cultivation?

After some contemplation, Yang Kai realized it would be challenging. He had expended sixty-five drops of Yang Liquid to break through a small realm, and that was with the energy gained from dual cultivation with Su Yan, which was far more precious and pure than ordinary Yang Liquid.

Even if he used up all the remaining Yang Liquid in his Dantian, it would surely not be enough to support his breakthrough to the Qi Movement Realm.

Nevertheless, he was determined to give it his all this time!

Gritting his teeth, he detonated another fifty drops of Yang Liquid, sending them into Su Yan's body as he operated his technique.

Su Yan's mind was shaken!

When the massive True Yang Yuan Qi first erupted from Yang Kai's body, she had been utterly astonished. By the second eruption, she had grown somewhat numb, but the terrifying energy of the third eruption left her unable to remain calm once more.

Where did he get so much primordial energy? Su Yan felt puzzled but did not ask, only feeling a gentle sense of comfort in her heart.

Because... this was the man she had close contact with. If all went well, he might be the man she would spend her life with.

The stronger he became, the happier Su Yan naturally felt.

After three days, Yang Kai and Su Yan finally concluded their first dual cultivation journey. Three days was a long time, yet in the unity of their bodies and souls, it felt like just a fleeting moment.

Three days later, both of them awoke. Su Yan could clearly sense that with this dual cultivation, her icy energy had become even purer, surpassing her previous levels by a significant margin.

This realization dulled her regret over losing her purity.

They exchanged glances, Yang Kai beaming with joy while Su Yan blushed.

While immersed in cultivation, she had not felt much. But now, she felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her.

She found herself in an extremely shameful position, straddling Yang Kai, her arms wrapped around his neck, both of them completely bare, intimately connected.

A scorching and hard sensation filled her lower abdomen. It overwhelmed her senses, and Su Yan could even feel a rhythmic pulsing emanating from him. Each pulse sent her heart racing, her body softening as if struck by lightning, leaving her unable to muster any strength.

She had never imagined that one day she would remain in such a position with a man for three whole days without moving. She had thought that by cultivating the Ice Heart Technique, she would freeze her body and mind, living a solitary life.

But now, due to a legacy and a dual cultivation technique, she had formed an inseparable bond with a man she had initially been only slightly acquainted with.

It was hard to describe the feeling—somewhat lost yet also filled with joy and happiness.

Summoning her courage, Su Yan looked at Yang Kai, her eyes filled with tenderness.

"Yang Kai..." His fiery gaze was filled with desire, fixated on Su Yan's pure face. The dual cultivation had ended, and the fire dragon and ice phoenix had long since vanished, yet Yang Kai still felt an irresistible temptation overwhelming his senses, like a tide crashing upon him, threatening to engulf him.

Su Yan pressed her lips tightly together, her hands cradling Yang Kai's face, her head lowered as their foreheads gently touched.

"Not yet!" Su Yan's voice trembled with struggle, the intimacy allowing her to easily sense Yang Kai's thoughts and desires. Refusing him at this moment required immense determination, "Let me help you break through first!"

As her words fell, a surge of primordial energy flowed from Su Yan directly into Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai's mind focused, quickly holding his breath and calming himself, suppressing the heat and madness in his eyes, swiftly operating his technique to absorb the energy transmitted from Su Yan.

He did not refuse; although this might not be beneficial for Su Yan and could slightly diminish her strength, Yang Kai could feel her sincere intentions.

The primordial energy in his meridians was already full, and with Su Yan's energy surging in, it became even more swollen. The sensation of soreness returned, but Su Yan did not stop.

She could sense Yang Kai's limits and would not let her actions harm him.

The fluctuations of primordial energy around them grew increasingly intense, forming a wind that swirled around them.

Moments later, when Yang Kai reached his limit, Su Yan dared not send any more energy.

"Continue!" Yang Kai closed his eyes and said in a muffled voice.

"But..."

"Continue!"

Su Yan gritted her teeth, yielding to Yang Kai's wishes, and once again infused her primordial energy into him.

Having cultivated the Harmony Technique, the primordial energy within both of them would not dissipate during their exchange, which was an unmatched advantage.

After a while, the energy fluctuations emanating from Yang Kai grew increasingly fierce. Pain shot through his meridians, but he gritted his teeth, allowing his body to tremble, sweat pouring down, yet he remained silent.

"Don't stop!" Yang Kai shouted.

Su Yan's beautiful eyes trembled; she feared to continue sending energy into Yang Kai, worried he might not withstand it and damage his foundation. Yet she could also feel Yang Kai's determination.

It was a will to grow stronger! A will born from his desire to protect her.

Before today, Yang Kai might not have felt such urgency, but now that they had shared such intimacy, and with their strength disparity so great, how could he remain complacent?

Men were meant to protect women; if he wanted to shield Su Yan, he had to become stronger than her!

This was Yang Kai's thought, and Su Yan sensed it, stirring her heart.

After struggling for a long time, Su Yan continued to infuse her energy.

The energy fluctuations surged violently, gradually becoming wild, like a rebellious spirit resisting Yang Kai's constraints, desperately struggling to break free from his meridians and gain its own freedom.

Su Yan paused. She knew Yang Kai had reached the brink of a breakthrough. Such a phenomenon in a warrior's body indicated the signs of breaking through to the Qi Movement Realm.

At that moment, the pain on Yang Kai's face vanished, and the soreness in his meridians dissipated. The continuous influx of primordial energy not only caused him no harm but also made his meridians wider and more resilient, capable of accommodating this energy.

The constraints of heaven and earth were within reach. This layer of shackles represented the heavenly power obstructing Yang Kai's breakthrough, just like the last time he broke through to the Open Origin Realm.

Breaking through this layer of shackles would allow him to ascend to the Qi Movement Realm!

Yang Kai immersed himself in this realization, his mind fully absorbed in comprehension.

As he comprehended, his expression grew increasingly calm, yet the primordial energy within him became more restless.

A surge of energy seeped from his bones, filling Yang Kai with a wicked aura. Su Yan watched in secret alarm, not daring to disturb him.

After a long time, this wicked aura suddenly retracted and vanished.

At this moment, the fluctuations of primordial energy within Yang Kai had reached a violent peak, yet he slowly opened his eyes, a smile appearing at the corners of his mouth.

He had reached the Qi Movement Realm!

With Su Yan's strong assistance, Yang Kai successfully broke through.

With a thunderous boom, like a bolt from the blue, the entire Inheritance Celestial Cave shook slightly, the winds and clouds shifting. The energy within this peculiar space surged towards the hall, then poured into Yang Kai's body.

This was fortune; every warrior experiences such fortune when breaking through a major realm, the power of heaven and earth refining their flesh and bones, making them stronger.

As for how much benefit one could gain, it all depended on their efforts.

When Yang Kai broke through to the Open Origin Realm, he had also enjoyed such fortune, but this time, the heavenly power pouring into his body was evidently greater and more substantial.

As he opened his eyes, he found Su Yan's worried gaze.

Yang Kai smiled and said, "Let me give you something!"

As he spoke, he immersed his mind, dividing half of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew stored within his Proud Bone Golden Body and sending it into Su Yan's body.

A cool sensation washed over her, and Su Yan's expression brightened, "What is this?"

"Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, said to be very useful for True Essence Realm warriors!" Yang Kai's hands wandered over Su Yan's smooth back as he spoke earnestly, "You refine it while I temper my body."

"Okay!" Su Yan nodded obediently.

Although refining the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew this way would certainly not yield the same effectiveness as when Xia Ningshang had done so, it was still a heavenly spirit material, enough to enhance Su Yan's strength to some extent.

As long as it could exert even twenty percent of its efficacy, it would be sufficient to compensate for Su Yan's loss in helping Yang Kai!
