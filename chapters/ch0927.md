## Chapter 927 — Yang Kai Is Back?

At the entrance to the Void Passage, Fengyu Tower disciples were hauled out one after another, their eyes dull and their faces stained by unbearable humiliation, each looking as if their very heartstrings had been ripped apart.

A disciple from the Xiaoyao Divine Cult stood before Yu Chun to report, only to find Elder Yu showing no reaction at all; the disciple felt a chill of confusion in his chest.

“Is that what your sect leader ordered?” Yang Kai squinted and turned his gaze toward the disciple.

“Who are you?” The disciple gave Yang Kai a quick once-over; seeing a stranger, he frowned and demanded.

Yang Kai grinned: “My identity isn’t important. I ask you this — did your sect leader instruct you to place these people here?”

“Yes. What of it? These barbarians won’t behave; they even dare think of resisting. After we killed a few of them, they were forced into obedience.” The disciple answered matter-of-factly. He had assumed Yang Kai was a guest of the Divine Cult, so he spoke plainly and without reserve.

“Good.” Yang Kai nodded lightly; a cold light burst from his eyes, sharp as a blade.

“Master…” As if sensing his killing intent, Li Rong’s face went icy; she called his title tentatively.

“Kill them all!” Yang Kai barked.

Li Rong and Han Fei inclined their heads, silent. A towering wave of demonic qi surged from their bodies, plunging the heavens and earth into suffocating blackness, blotting out every scrap of light.

In that instant, everyone felt a thick aura of death flow through their hearts, and at the same time, a bone-piercing chill seeped into them.

There was no sound of struggle, no cries of agony.

In barely ten breaths, when the darkness that had shrouded heaven and earth finally subsided and light returned, every martial artist tied to the Xiaoyao Divine Cult stood frozen where they were, life extinguished. Each stared with eyes wide and bloodshot, as if they had witnessed some unimaginable horror in their last moments.

The five Saint Realm First Stage practitioners possessed greater fortitude; though Li Rong’s aura bound them, they did not die instantly.

As a temporary surge of awareness returned, Yu Chun glared at Yang Kai, teeth grinding: “You actually…”

It seemed only now he recognized the viciousness in Yang Kai — with no words exchanged, he moved to strike, leaving no mercy.

Crack, crack, crack…

A series of crisp sounds rang out. Each of the five Saint Realm men was coated head to toe in ice, transformed in an instant into lifelike icy statues.

Han Fei snapped her fingers; the five vivid ice sculptures shattered with a roar, dissolving into five balls of phosphorescent light that scattered through the air.

The Fengyu Tower disciples who had emerged from the Void Passage were petrified, their faces ashen as they stared at this unimaginable scene.

They knew the strength of those warriors who had been brought here; yet these foes, who had seemed invincible, were utterly helpless before these few — crushed like ants.

What unfathomable cultivation did these people possess?

Terror warred with exhilaration as all eyes turned toward Yang Kai’s group.

Soon, surprise flared across many of the Fengyu Tower disciples’ faces.

“It’s those two Hu sisters!”

“They brought help?”

“Huh, that leading man looks familiar…”

“Yeah, I feel like I’ve seen him before.”

Whispered gossip spread among the Fengyu Tower disciples. Some loudly hailed the Hu sisters and offered thanks; others scrutinized Yang Kai with suspicion, while some had already recognized his identity, their hearts surging with turbulent waves.

On the ground, Du Yishuang helped Fang Ziqi to his feet and he slowly rose.

Yang Kai strode over with a faint smile at the corner of his mouth.

Once his face was seen clearly, Du Yishuang covered her mouth in surprise; Fang Ziqi looked as if he had seen a ghost, eyes fixed and mouth gaping.

“Brother Fang, it’s been a long time.” Yang Kai stopped before him and, with a wave, dispelled the seal that bound him, offering a slight nod.

Fang Ziqi remained speechless, staring as if unable to look away. Then, softly: “Shuang’er, pinch me and see.”

“Why would I pinch you?” Du Yishuang asked, astonished.

“I want to know if this is a dream.”

Du Yishuang couldn’t help but laugh through tears: “Senior Brother, this isn’t a dream…”

“So this means the person standing before me is truly Yang Kai?”

“Who else could it be?” Yang Kai laughed, the gloom that had weighed on him evaporating as he burst into full-throated laughter.

“Yang brother, you finally appeared.” Fang Ziqi’s relief showed plainly; he gripped Yang Kai’s hand hard and urged, “Return to Lingxiao Pavilion quickly. All three of our sects have been bullied.”

Yang Kai nodded, squinting. “I came for that very reason. We’ll talk later — this place isn’t safe. You’ll go back with me.”

Fang Ziqi nodded emphatically, set his jaw: “We must return!”

Li Rong waved her hand; a gentle force radiated from her and, in that moment, all the Fengyu Tower disciples whose powers had been sealed regained their freedom.

“Han Fei, you and Elder Shi Kun secure the rear. Li Rong and I will go first.” Yang Kai announced, then, with Li Rong leading, dashed toward the Void Passage.

Just as they neared the entrance, another Xiaoyao Divine Cult disciple appeared and, before he could grasp the situation, a huge hand descended and covered his head — he didn’t even have time to react before he exploded into a spray of blood.

Bathed in that blood, Yang Kai’s blood boiled and a roaring fire flared in his chest; he slipped into the Void Passage.

A moment of weightlessness passed. When their vision cleared, he and Li Rong had already appeared above a mining area.

It was the Blood Battle Gang’s mine.

Below, many people had gathered, grouped into three clusters.

Hovering midair, Yang Kai’s eyes scanned and he confirmed those three groups were organized by the neighboring sects.

Each person’s power had been bound. Those closest to the Void Passage were Fengyu Tower people, being driven through the passage under the Xiaoyao Divine Cult disciples’ taunts and whips.

The Blood Battle Gang and Lingxiao Pavilion’s people were still waiting.

Yang Kai’s gaze swept to Lingxiao Pavilion and he saw many familiar faces.

The Xiaoyao Divine Cult treated the three sects with extreme malice. At this moment several Lingxiao Pavilion elders seemed to be arguing with some Xiaoyao disciples, shouting; those disciples wielded barbed whips and lashed at the aged elders, tearing skin from flesh.

Sheltered by those elders in the center was a young man treated differently from the others: not only were his powers sealed, his body was bound and riddled with wounds; he sat slumped on the ground, his gaze full of hatred at the Xiaoyao disciples, eyes bloodshot yet powerless to resist.

Su Mu!

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. Though he didn’t know why Su Mu had been subjected to such treatment, he didn’t hesitate; power surged through him and a brilliant spear of light appeared in his hand, hurled downward with murderous force.

Whoosh…

The Heaven-Slaying Spear pierced clean through one of the Xiaoyao disciples who’d been whipping a Lingxiao elder, blowing the man’s torso apart; fragments burst outward in all directions with terrible force.

The companions around him could not evade in time — they were blown into riddled corpses and collapsed dead.

The tumult ceased. Countless gazes turned upward.

In the deep of night, the moon hung like a silver plate.

Before that bright moon a lone figure stood, wind howling, his garments snapping; an aura of bone-chilling cold radiated from him.

“Who’s there?” came a harsh shout. Several Transcendent Realm martial artists, arrogant, rose into the air and, without parley, attacked Yang Kai.

Thuds rang out…

A few dull impacts sounded; the Transcendent Realm attackers were met with heavy injury, fell headlong toward the ground, their deaths sudden and inexplicable.

From the Void Passage, Fang Ziqi led the charge, appearing right behind Yang Kai, his inner power raging as he roared to the heavens, “Yang Kai is back! Brothers and sisters, kill these bastards!”

As he spoke, he was already unleashing martial techniques, sweeping at the nearby enemies.

One after another, figures poured from the Void Passage behind Fang Ziqi, following like furious beasts as they launched suicidal attacks.

“Yang Kai is back?”

The three sects’ disciples were stunned for an instant, and only when fighting broke out did they snap awake, straining their eyes skyward to see if the man above was truly the Yang Kai who had disappeared ten years ago.

Moments later the shouts swelled — all those who had been escorted here surged forward, as if pumped full of vigor, howling and attacking the Xiaoyao disciples even without using their internal power, behaving like ordinary people driven by rage.

“Li Rong, help!” Yang Kai barked. As he moved, streams of True Yuan condensed into tangible force and smashed into the enemy.

The Xiaoyao disciples were dumbfounded; they couldn’t understand why hearing that Yang Kai had returned caused these people to fight like they had no regard for their lives.

What did this Yang Kai mean to them?

The Xiaoyao camp here had few true experts to begin with; after the handful of Transcendent Realm members were cut down first, what remained were insignificant figures.

In no more than thirty breaths, and before Elder Shi Kun and Han Fei could reach the rear, every Xiaoyao disciple present had been slain.

Corpses littered the ground and blood flowed in rivers, yet every living person’s expression was elated as they scanned the area, searching the crowd for someone.

After a moment, all eyes turned to one place: Yang Kai was striding toward the Lingxiao elders’ location.

Great Elder Wei Xitong, Second Elder Su Xuanwu, Third Elder He Beishui, Fifth Elder You Zizai — except for Fourth Elder Zhou Fei, who had been killed by the Evil Lord — the Lingxiao elders were all present.

They seemed almost incredulous; only when Yang Kai came forward, bowed and greeted them, did they finally let out a heavy breath.

Wei Xitong wept openly: “It’s enough that you’ve returned; the sect is saved.”

Yang Kai looked at him with deep intensity, then, appearing wearied, said, “I returned late; I let the elders and the sect suffer.”
