## Chapter 2048 — Investigation

A thunderous crash rang out as the red-haired man's blade technique collided with Kang Siran’s Secret Treasure, erupting into blinding light and terrifying energy waves that rippled outward.

At the same time, Yang Kai and the fat warrior had already come to blows. Yang Kai’s sneak attack was sudden, but the fat man was no ordinary fighter—he had taken part in this operation and been left by Zong Qing and Lian Yuming to guard the entrance; he was one of Blazing Fire Hall’s elites, capable of fighting above his rank.

He drew a deep breath and his body swelled, then spat forth a dragon of fire that surged forward, forcing Yang Kai into a narrow space with almost nowhere to dodge.

After the blaze passed, Yang Kai’s figure seemed to melt and gradually vanish.

The fat warrior’s brow furrowed; instinct told him Yang Kai should not be so easily killed, yet he could see no trace of him, and his heart gave a jolt as a bad feeling rose.

At that moment a strange force manifested behind him; it formed like a cage and wrapped around him, and the surrounding space grew viscous as if he had sunk into a quagmire—the power impeded his bodily agility and even disrupted the flow of his internal power.

"Domain Field! How is that possible!" the fat warrior cried in alarm.

He was also a Third Stage of the Void King Realm practitioner, and his own Domain Field had reached consummation; when facing foes his Domain Field normally enveloped his body as protection.

Yet when this opponent’s Domain Field was unleashed, he suddenly felt his own Domain Field completely suppressed.

Both were at the Third Stage — how could the other’s Domain Field be so terrifying? Compared to it, his own Domain Field seemed mere child’s play.

Moreover, within the opponent’s Domain Field there seemed to be a most peculiar force — a power that could affect space itself.

Terrified, he bit his tongue to draw blood and spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood, screaming as he desperately poured his Origin Qi into breaking free from the Domain Field’s restraint and oppression.

Crackling sounds rang out; his bones creaked loudly in an unpleasant grinding that made one’s teeth ache to hear.

From behind him Yang Kai’s eyes cooled; a long sword appeared in his palm as he poured power into it. With a clear ring the blade wrapped him in sword-light, becoming a whirlwind as its tip flashed toward the fat warrior’s neck.

Before the sword-light reached him, an indescribable force had already enveloped the fat warrior.

The fat warrior shuddered, his perpetually narrowed eyes suddenly widening as if seeing a ghost in broad daylight, disbelief written across his face.

A flash of light swept past, and Yang Kai once more appeared before the pudgy cultivator. Sword in hand, he gave the blade a casual flick, shaking loose a single bead of crimson blood.

The pudgy warrior stood rooted to the spot, staring at Yang Kai in a daze, his throat rasping as if he wanted to speak, but in the end he could only choke out the word: "Laws…"

As the word fell, the fat man’s corpulent body deflated like a punctured balloon; a blood-red mark bloomed on his neck and blood spurted like a fountain as a force flung his head away.

With a smack, the fat warrior’s headless corpse fell on its back.

“You… you actually dare to kill my Senior Brother!” On the other side, the red‑haired fighter’s face drained of color and he went rigid with terror, a hoarse cry ripping from him as if his very soul had fled.

He was less shocked by his Senior Brother’s death than by the fact Yang Kai could do it so swiftly. He knew his Senior Brother’s strength all too well — a true elite among the Blazing Fire Hall — so how could such a cultivator be beheaded in a few strokes by someone who was also only a Third Stage of the Void King Realm?

As he shouted he sucked in cold air, his whole body chilled.

Yang Kai lifted his head and said coldly, "So what if I killed him? You’re next!"

"Ah!" the red-haired man cried and retreated in terror.

Yang Kai barked, "Brother Kang, don’t hold back."

With that Yang Kai was again wrapped in sword-light and slashed at the red-haired man; seeing this, Kang Siran gritted his teeth and fully unleashed his Secret Treasure’s power to press the attack.

Though the red‑haired warrior’s power rivaled that of the rotund Senior Brother, he could not withstand a coordinated assault. Yang Kai’s sword‑light cleaved like a meteor while Kang Siran’s Secret Treasure bore down from the flank, leaving the red‑haired man to receive blow after blow with no chance to counter. The cramped terrain offered him no avenue of retreat—every step back only drove him deeper into their onslaught—so he could do nothing but take the punishment until his defenses finally collapsed.

After half an incense stick’s time, the red-haired man too lay fallen in a pool of blood.

Only then did Kang Siran seem to reassess Yang Kai, appraising him with astonishment shining in his eyes.

Though Shopkeeper Kang had known Yang Kai for some time, this was the first truly cooperative fight; until now Kang Siran had not realized Yang Kai’s strength was so ferocious.

"Brother Yang, that long sword in your hand — is it a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure?" Kang Siran asked thoughtfully.

Yang Kai grinned and nodded, "Indeed."

That long sword had been the one Han Leng had used; after Han Leng’s death it had naturally become Yang Kai’s spoil. Although Yang Kai had not reached the Dao Origin Realm, having absorbed and refined so much fragmented Power of the Laws within the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, he could draw upon some Law power; aided by the sword and spatial arts, slaying opponents of the same rank was effortless.

"Brother Yang can actually mobilize the Power of the Laws — advancement can’t be far off; I’m truly envious," Kang Siran sighed.

Though he was much older than Yang Kai and had been at Third Stage far longer, he still could not grasp the threshold of the Laws and remained stuck outside the Dao Origin Realm; the comparison left him both admiring and dejected.

"Brother Kang, don’t be anxious — as long as we find a Dao Origin Pill here, what’s there to fear about advancement?" Yang Kai said casually.

Kang Siran’s eyes brightened and he nodded, "Exactly."

The two then picked up the Spatial Rings from the dead Blazing Fire Hall warriors, each took one, and continued their exploration inward.

Neither Yang Kai nor Kang Siran had time to thoroughly inspect Gongsun Mu’s tomb; upon entering they had been immediately blocked by the fat warrior and the red-haired man.

Ahead was a corridor not particularly wide, its sides dotted with strange stones that emitted a faint glow, so it was not dim.

They carefully probed as they moved forward and encountered no danger nor any more of Blazing Fire Hall’s people.

There were traces of Blazing Fire Hall having passed this way, but no sign of where they had gone.

After about an incense stick’s time the two suddenly stepped into a spacious stone chamber.

Looking about, Yang Kai could not help but be astonished: there was no way onward, and the chamber contained nothing but many stone cauldrons carved from stone.

There were quite a number of those stone cauldrons — at least thirty by rough count.

Stranger still, no Blazing Fire Hall people were present here.

"Brother Yang, what’s going on?" Kang Siran asked, astonished.

Yang Kai shook his head and cautiously sent out his Divine Sense, finding no trace of danger. He said, "There were no branching paths along the way; Blazing Fire Hall should have reached here, but they are nowhere to be seen... Could there be a teleportation formation here?"

Kang Siran thought that made sense and immediately said, "Shall we search?"

Yang Kai nodded, "Brother Kang, I’ll inspect the chamber; you check the route-map and see if you can find an exit."

"Good," Kang Siran replied, taking a yellowed beast-skin parchment from his Spatial Ring and frowning as he examined it.

Yang Kai used the time to carefully search every corner of the chamber.

The chamber was not large; after a short while he returned to his starting point and his gaze swept over the stone cauldrons.

If anything in the chamber seemed suspicious, it was undoubtedly those stone cauldrons.

But he had already probed them carefully with Divine Sense; the stone cauldrons revealed nothing odd and were not forging materials — merely ordinary stone.

Glancing at Kang Siran still studying the beast-skin parchment, Yang Kai did not disturb him and instead stepped to a stone cauldron and touched it.

The instant his hand made contact a strange cracking sound rang out, and the ground where Yang Kai stood suddenly split open.

His body dropped and he began to fall downward.

Yang Kai was mildly alarmed but not panicked; he shifted his internal power to rise.

Astonishingly, just as he began to circulate his power, an immense suction surged up from beneath his feet — before he could even take off it yanked him straight into a gaping black pit in the ground.

Yang Kai’s face truly changed; he only had time to shout once before hurtling straight down.

Above him the previously open black hole sealed in that instant, plunging him into darkness.

"Brother Yang!" Kang Siran cried, leaping toward the spot, but he was too late; when he reached it Yang Kai had vanished.

Staring at where Yang Kai had disappeared, Kang Siran’s expression shifted repeatedly; he gritted his teeth and grabbed the stone cauldron Yang Kai had touched.

Nothing happened! The ground did not split as he expected. After several tries Kang Siran confirmed his attempt was useless.

With no choice, he tested the other stone cauldrons one by one; only when he tried the seventh did a fissure open beneath his feet, and he too fell downward like Yang Kai.
