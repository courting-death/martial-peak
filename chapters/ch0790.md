## Chapter 790 — Elder Xu Hui

Three Saint Realm experts of the Demon race, unaware of the full situation, engaged Saintess Nan in combat and instantly found themselves locked in a brutal struggle.

Although there were three of them, Saintess Nan's cultivation was a Stage higher than each of theirs; facing three at once, she showed no sign of falling behind.

Yang Kai, seeing this, was overjoyed.

Without a word, he seized An Ling'er and fled at once!

“That brat…” Yu Mo, though witnessing the scene, could not free himself to intervene; he ground his teeth in hatred, realizing this mission was likely doomed. He vented all his fury on Saintess Nan, sparing no moves, and the Saint‑Grade Secret Treasure he unleashed erupted with immense power.

After the time it takes for half an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai and An Ling'er had already fled over a hundred li; even from such a distance the cataclysmic ripples of the Saint Realm clash could still be felt, leaving them both shaken.

He couldn't shake the feeling that the Saint Realm differed from the Mortal Realms in essence—not merely a difference in magnitude, but that the True Yuan flowing through every Saint Realm expert he'd encountered felt somehow different from mortal True Yuan.

Having not reached that level himself, Yang Kai didn't know what secrets the Saint Realm held and would have to ask someone later.

“Eh…” An Ling'er suddenly made a soft sound; her brows tightened into a line, as if silently sensing something.

Yang Kai's face also grew serious. Probing with his Divine Sense, he discovered several top masters closing in on them at lightning speed!

The auras radiating from these people were in no way inferior to Yu Mo and the others; in fact, one of them could be mentioned in the same breath as Saintess Nan!

So many Saint Realm experts appearing in this desolate place at once—Yang Kai found it impossible to ignore.

Just as Yang Kai planned to pull An Ling'er away from the incoming masters, An Ling'er suddenly smiled, her features relaxing: “They're from my Sacred Land!”

“Ah?” Yang Kai stared in astonishment.

“We're saved, then—Elder Xu Hui must have brought them!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai frowned slightly; though it seemed a coincidence, it wasn't inexplicable. If they were truly experts of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, they could trace Saintess Nan's trail to find An Ling'er—provided, of course, that An Ling'er was still alive.

Yang Kai instinctively wanted to bolt. He had no desire for any contact with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, but he quelled the urge.

Leaving now would make him look guilty and only arouse suspicion. Besides, he couldn't be sure Saintess Nan wouldn't pursue him once separated from An Ling'er; if she drove off Yu Mo and the others and then hunted the lone Yang Kai, he would be powerless to resist. In the present circumstances, staying with those approaching experts was undeniably the safer option.

“An Ling'er…” Yang Kai suddenly whispered.

“Mm?”

“How have I treated you lately?”

“Treated me?” An Ling'er paused, thought for a moment, blushed faintly and said softly, “Very well.”

Whether under the sea, in the Small Xuan Realm, or in the Demon Domain, Yang Kai had looked after her, even bringing her along when fleeing. After a year of shared hardship, An Ling'er already regarded Yang Kai as the person she depended on.

“Do me a favor—when you meet people from your Sacred Land, don't bring up anything about the Saint Lord, and under no circumstances tell them I learned three moves of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique from you!”

“You don't want to be Saint Lord?” An Ling'er perceptively read Yang Kai's intent.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “I’ve said it: even without becoming Saint Lord I can reach that height. If I became your Saint Lord, I’m afraid I wouldn’t last even three hundred years before turning into a heap of bleached bones! My death is no big deal, but many would be heartbroken.”

“All women, right?” An Ling'er asked softly, her tone a little sour.

“Ahem… only one or two, I suppose,” Yang Kai said awkwardly.

“Fine. Since you resist so much, I won't say a word. Once we're somewhere safe, you can leave on your own; I don't think Elder Xu Hui and the others will treat you too harshly.” An Ling'er pursed her lips and said.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded slightly and continued forward without slowing, heading straight toward the approaching group.

While they spoke, several Divine Senses probed toward them; sensing back, those Divine Senses revealed joy and excitement—clearly they'd recognized An Ling'er's life aura.

Moments later, several long rainbow trails came into view, and a voice called from afar: “Is the one approaching the Saintess Her Highness?”

“Elder!” An Ling'er hurriedly responded.

“It truly is the Saintess!” The rainbow trails quickened, and in the blink of an eye they arrived before Yang Kai and An Ling'er.

Four Saint Realm cultivators!

The one in the lead must be the Elder Xu Hui An Ling'er had mentioned, two Stages into the Saint Realm and in no way inferior to Saintess Nan. Dressed in a gray robe, his hawk‑like eyes flashed keen light and his bearing was quietly imposing.

Behind him were three other Saint Realm experts, likely all from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Such a formidable lineup showed the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's deep foundations—had the old Saint Lord and Saintess Nan not perished, this Sacred Land would have boasted two additional top experts.

Even the powerful Tianxiao Sect had only two Saint Realm cultivators—Chu Lingxiao and another senior uncle of Yang Kai's he had never encountered.

Compared to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, the Tianxiao Sect appeared rather weak.

With such resources, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land ranked among the foremost forces in the great realm; however, after the double calamity of the old Saint Lord and Saintess Nan's deaths, the Sacred Land would surely decline quite a bit.

“The old Saint Lord's spirit watches from heaven—it's a relief that the Saintess is truly unharmed!” Xu Hui quickly cupped his fist in salute, his face filled with obvious relief; the other three experts wore similar expressions, showing how concerned they'd been for An Ling'er's safety and immediately attending to her upon seeing her.

An Ling'er waved them off, indicating she was unharmed.

As he looked, Xu Hui's hawk‑like eyes settled on Yang Kai, a trace of approval appearing on his face as he inclined his head slightly: “This young man should be the future Saint Lord, yes?”

Yang Kai's expression shifted and his brow tightened; the old man's first words left him somewhat at a loss.

An Ling'er was also surprised and hurriedly shook her head: “No, Elder, you misunderstand…”

“Heh heh, Saintess, you needn't hide it from me. I've already heard of what happened on those Overseas isles from Qian Ning!” Xu Hui kept nodding, his eyes full of admiration and satisfaction. “Talented and promising—comprehending three moves of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique at once is something no past Saint Lord achieved.”

Yang Kai was inwardly more astonished, but outwardly remained indifferent and unperturbed, showing no desire to speak.

An Ling'er paused and exclaimed with delight: “Uncle Qian isn't dead?”

On those Overseas isles, to buy time for Yang Kai and An Ling'er to escape, Qian Ning and several other mortal experts from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land launched suicide attacks on Saintess Nan; Yang Kai had seen him torn to pieces by Saintess Nan and had no reason to think he survived.

Xu Hui shook his head in sorrow: “He's dead. Everyone in your scouting party except you perished, but Qian Ning left behind a final message before dying. Because of that I learned you were seeking the future Saint Lord, and by tracing Saintess Nan's trail we were able to find you today.”

This aligned with Yang Kai's speculation, but thinking of Qian Ning made Yang Kai grit his teeth—this fellow had caused him trouble even in death and deserved no pity.

An Ling'er glanced at Yang Kai; seeing his sullen expression, her heart trembled and she didn't know what to do.

“This place is no place to linger—we should leave immediately!” Xu Hui glanced toward the hundred‑li distance and urged.

The others all nodded.

Yang Kai frowned. “What about Saintess Nan… shall we just leave her be?”

Xu Hui smiled awkwardly. “Don't laugh—I may not be a match for the Saintess, so even if I wanted to intervene, I couldn't.”

“Then won't she keep hunting me and An Ling'er afterward?” Yang Kai's expression showed displeasure.

“Once we're back in the Sacred Land there'll be no problem; Saintess Nan won't pursue across into our territory,” another Saint Realm expert quickly replied.

“So we must return to the Sacred Land as soon as possible!” Xu Hui spoke cautiously, looking at Yang Kai with considerable respect.

Their attitude was pleasant; though Yang Kai felt uneasy and didn't want ties with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, for the time being he had no choice but to go with them.

Yang Kai decided to observe them for a while—if they showed any ill intentions on the road he would slip away immediately. Until he was stronger, he'd avoid appearing before the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's people.

Now that they knew he had learned the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, he feared they wouldn't easily allow him to leave, which troubled him.

After obtaining his consent, Xu Hui visibly relaxed and wrapped Yang Kai and An Ling'er in True Yuan before speeding away.

Before long the group left the Demon Domain.

The Divine Sense that had been tracking Yang Kai and An Ling'er—the consciousness of Saintess Nan—was severed as distance increased.

Only then did Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief.

As they rushed on, Xu Hui seemed unwavering but was secretly observing, growing ever more astonished.

He noticed An Ling'er's attentiveness to Yang Kai—this wasn't the careful regard a Saintess shows a future Saint Lord, but a woman's concern for a man; whenever Yang Kai looked grave, An Ling'er became fearful and her pulse quickened.

This future Saint Lord… is extraordinary!

Xu Hui knew better than anyone who An Ling'er was; a Saintess raised by the Sacred Land would never be humble. That this future Saint Lord could so swiftly bring the Saintess to comply spoke volumes of his charm and means.
