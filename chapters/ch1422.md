## Chapter 1422 — Taixuan Sect Ruins

Half a month later, on the outskirts of the Flowing Flame Sandland, a warship over ten zhang long hung silently in midair; inside, Chang Qi, Hao An, Wu Yi, Qian Yue and the others waited anxiously.

Since the day of the Imperial Garden’s strange incident, Yang Kai and Yang Yan had left the vessel and vanished, and up to this moment they had not returned.

No one knew where they had gone, yet the finely forged warship had arrived at the Flowing Flame Sandland intact; still, Chang Qi and the others did not dare venture in rashly and could only park the ship outside and wait.

Fortunately, after the battle half a month prior, Dragon Lair Mountain’s fame had spread far and wide, so although the warship’s presence here drew attention, no sensible person dared cause trouble.

Being pointed at and whispered about was unavoidable. After the first Heat-Flame Zone of the Flowing Flame Sandland disappeared, many warriors had come to investigate, so this place was no longer deserted; on the contrary, it had become rather lively.

Naturally, a warship appearing here all of a sudden would attract notice.

Chang Qi and the others had already waited here three days without seeing any sign of Yang Kai or Yang Yan, and were at a loss when the buck‑toothed fighter Ge Qi suddenly lifted his brow and revealed a flash of joy: “The Sect Ancestor has returned — more than three thousand li from here!”

“Oh?” Wu Yi brightened with delight and, doubting nothing, said cheerfully, “If Senior Ye has returned, then Yang Kai and Senior Sister Yang Yan must have come back as well.”

With that she immediately ordered her subordinates to open the warship’s hatch and await them respectfully.

Sure enough, a moment later a stream of light shot across the sky and in an instant arrived before the warship. When the radiance dissipated, a diminutive craft emerged, shaped like a shark on the sea — clearly the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle that Yang Yan had forged.

Yang Kai and two others shot out from within; Yang Yan casually condensed Saint Yuan and drew the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle back.

Standing in midair, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and involuntarily frowned.

He detected many warriors lingering near the Flowing Flame Sandland; when he and the others appeared, they all showed curious expressions, staring this way and whispering among themselves.

After lingering a moment, Yang Kai circulated Saint Yuan and shouted in a clear voice, “From this day onward, a radius of one hundred thousand li around the Flowing Flame Sandland is under the jurisdiction of Dragon Lair Mountain. I ask all of you to leave at once. Anyone who approaches will be regarded as provoking Dragon Lair Mountain — bear the consequences yourselves!”

At his words, countless voices erupted in uproar.

Although Dragon Lair Mountain had shown might in the battle half a month ago and dealt severe blows to many top Sects’ experts, those reports were mostly hearsay; whether true or not no one had yet verified. Now Yang Kai spoke so boldly, and he had undoubtedly prodded a hornet’s nest.

The cause was simple: after the first Heat‑Flame Zone of the Flowing Flame Sandland mysteriously vanished, the second layer’s heaven‑and‑earth treasure region had been exposed. Though those who came here had not found many treasures, they had occasionally discovered rare minerals.

There were even rumors that in the area where the second layer’s treasure region had been lay a rich vein of Saint Crystal, containing untold quantities of Saint Crystal — enough to multiply a first‑rate Sect’s power many times over.

Saint Crystal mines were scarce on the Dark Star; although major forces held some mines, they had little, and extraction efficiency was low.

Most warriors who came were intent on seeking Saint Crystal veins. Yang Kai’s one sentence ordering them all away — how could they tolerate it?

In an instant, champions grew furious; shouts and clamor filled the air. Law does not punish the many — and besides, the Flowing Flame Sandland had long been one of Dark Star’s three forbidden zones, open to all; why had Yang Kai the right to act thus?

Listening to the uproar from all directions, Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent and unmoved; since he planned to take the Taixuan Sect ruins within the Flowing Flame Sandland as a foothold, he could not allow irrelevant people to linger nearby.

“Silence!” Before Yang Kai could speak, the woman surnamed Ye suddenly shouted sternly. With her peak cultivation at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, combined with her strange soul secret technique, that shout—though not loud—made the noisy crowd’s heads spin and faces turn pale with fright.

The scene instantly fell silent.

Her beautiful eyes swept about coldly as she said, “I give you one day. If after one day I still see you here, do not blame me for being ungracious.”

As her words fell, a powerful pressure rolled outward; in that instant the world seemed to stiffen, and all warriors wrapped by that invisible force found themselves unable to move or speak, even unable to circulate their Saint Yuan.

Under that power, their bodies felt as insignificant as ants.

The force of a perfected Shi was no thing for such curs to resist; even top experts of the same Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm who fell under the woman’s influence were like men mired in muck, their arms and legs bound — let alone the others.

“Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!” Immediately some knowledgeable folk recognized the woman surnamed Ye’s terrifying cultivation and grew pale with fear.

The rule that experts were to be respected was eternal. The woman surnamed Ye revealed but a sliver of power and those who had been shouting and jeering obediently shut their mouths. When she withdrew her aura, many warriors, sweating profusely, produced Star Shuttles and fled outward at great speed.

The second layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland’s heaven‑and‑earth treasure region did indeed possess many benefits and opportunities, but one could only enjoy them with life intact; if life were lost, all the world’s opportunities were meaningless.

Although unwilling, compared to their own lives it would be unwise to provoke such a powerful existence by remaining.

After the first wave fled, more people quickly departed; within the span of half a cup of tea, not a single one of the warriors who had surrounded them remained.

The woman surnamed Ye snorted coldly, then turned and lightly inclined her head toward Yang Yan and said with respect, “Lord, the miscellaneous people have been driven away.”

“Mm.” Yang Yan responded lightly. She glanced at the flame barrier blocking the way, flicked her wrist, and the Three Flames Ring shot forth as a ray of fire to merge with the Sandland’s barrier.

The next moment, the flame barrier split open with a strange seam large enough for the warship to pass through safely.

The Flowing Flame Sandland’s three Heat‑Flame Zones were formed from the Three Flames Ring and were imperial treasures; as a Soul Incarnation of the Great Emperor, Yang Yan could command them. Though she could not yet retract the second fire ring, she could make it part.

After Yang Kai and the others darted into the warship, a humming sounded and the ship slowly plunged into the interior of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

The voyage went smoothly without hindrance!

A short while later, inside what had originally been the Flowing Flame Sandland’s fourth layer, Yang Kai and the others stood before the Taixuan Sect ruins, gazing at the cloud‑shrouded, crisscrossing mountain ranges beyond the protective sect array.

Amidst the mist pavilions and terraces appeared and vanished; mountain ridges pulsed with Spiritual Qi, springs murmured in the valleys — a sight of such beauty it seemed not of the mortal world.

Standing there, Wu Yi and the others drew in deep, exaggerated breaths of the air around them, their faces flushed and expressions filled with excitement.

Earlier, when Yang Kai had claimed there was a new foothold a hundred or a thousand times better than Dragon Lair Mountain, they had taken it with a grain of salt and doubted it; now, standing here, they had not a shred of doubt.

Even before entering they could feel such dense Spiritual Qi; if they truly stepped inside, what might they find?

To say it was a hundred or a thousand times better than Dragon Lair Mountain was no exaggeration!

Moreover, if they could truly settle here, with the Flowing Flame Sandland’s flame barrier protecting them, no one could threaten them — this was a paradise, enough to drive anyone to madness with longing and greed.

That such a place existed within the Flowing Flame Sandland astonished them.

Yet the Protective Sect Array looked impregnable, far deeper and more arcane than Dragon Lair Mountain’s; they did not know whether it could be broken.

While they worried inwardly, Yang Yan turned to Yang Kai and extended a hand, her lips moving slightly.

No one else heard her speak, but Yang Kai understood, reached into his Spatial Ring and drew out a token‑like object which he handed to Yang Yan.

“An Imperial Token…” The woman surnamed Ye’s gaze sharpened as she instantly recognized it as a Star Emperor Token. She recalled how she had once used her centuries‑old family heirloom Star Emperor Token to exchange for a miraculous pill to heal herself and could not help feeling ashamed and uneasy.

The token she had once possessed had been a treasure passed down by the Great Emperor; although its internal sealing technique had been expended, it was not something to be traded away lightly, and the memory of that made her uneasy, fearing whether she might be blamed.

Thankfully Yang Yan did not seem inclined to pursue the matter. She pressed Saint Yuan into the Star Emperor Token and then applied it to the light screen of the Protective Sect Array.

Light flashed; innumerable intricate rune patterns swam across the once‑impenetrable array like fish, then a humming rose and, accompanied by a strong energy ripple, the Taixuan Sect’s protective array split to either side and revealed a road leading straight inward.

Though he had expected it to some degree, Yang Kai could not help a wry smile at how easily Yang Yan had opened the screen.

When he had once ventured into the Fourth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland, he had seen a fighter named Leng Qing at Star Emperor Mountain hurl attacks at that same light screen; no matter how he struck it, he could not damage it a whit.

That Leng Qing had even invited him then, but Yang Kai had declined.

In hindsight that decision proved most wise; though the Protective Sect Array had endured countless years, it was not something a Saint King Realm warrior could break through by brute force.

“Let us go.” Yang Yan’s expression was slightly complex, as if recalling something; she was not the Great Emperor in body — though she had inherited some of the Great Emperor’s memories, they were incomplete, and so she felt both familiar and strange toward the Taixuan Sect.
