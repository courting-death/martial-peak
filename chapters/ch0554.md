## Chapter 554 — Golden Pupil Eye

Within the world of the Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai and the old man’s Spirit Body chased and fled in turn, circling around the Five-Colored Treasure Island.

The old man was unwilling to have a direct confrontation with Yang Kai’s Spirit Body for fear of suffering some accident, but Yang Kai, young and reckless, relentlessly pursued him, as if determined to kill him.

In terms of momentum alone, the old man was at a disadvantage.

Yet in truth, Yang Kai had no real means of harming the other. Although this was his own Sea of Consciousness and he held dominion here, the old man had nearly a century’s head start in cultivating and utilizing Divine Sense power, and such long-term accumulation ensured he could evade Yang Kai’s pursuit unharmed.

While fleeing, the old man even had the leisure to constantly observe the colorful treasure island.

The more he looked, the harder it was to suppress his covetous desire. He knew not what this island truly was, but could feel a gentle warmth emanating from it.

When his Spirit Body was near the island, his Divine Sense power seemed to strengthen greatly, the portion spent rapidly regenerating.

In an instant, the old man comprehended: this marvelous Five-Colored Island must be a supreme treasure capable of nurturing Divine Sense! This explained how Yang Kai had such a vast Divine Sense force even at the second tier of the Divine Roaming Realm.

The root of it all lay in this Five-Colored Island.

Its value might even surpass the Earth Demon’s Divine Skill.

With this thought, the old man’s breathing quickened slightly.

His Divine Sense had silently infiltrated Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, originally hoping to seize control in a moment of neglect; though his attempt had met with some mishap, he had now discovered a treasure of immense worth.

This expedition was worth it!

Though his Spirit Body was injured, he resolved to capture this young man. The secrets and wealth hidden within him were so dazzling they stirred envy in all.

As if sensing the old man’s shift in intention, Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

He carried three great secrets that could never be revealed to anyone he didn’t fully trust.

First was the Wordless Black Book, a secret no one else knew; second was the Five-Color Warm Spirit Lotus, known only to the Earth Demon; the third was the Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Now the second secret was laid bare before his enemy’s eyes, and the old man was clearly intrigued by the Warm Spirit Lotus. Yang Kai immediately grew hostile.

No matter what, he could not allow this adversary to leave his Sea of Consciousness unscathed and leak this secret!

At that thought, his entire Sea of Consciousness trembled. Countless attacks poured in like swarms of locusts, assaulting from every direction toward the old man.

The old man suddenly halted, turning to look quietly at Yang Kai, sneering, “Young scion of the Yang Family, you’re still too green!”

A shiver struck Yang Kai’s heart as a sudden sense of crisis arose.

The old man laughed heartily, “You thought I was fleeing chased by you? Ha! I’ve merely been setting traps in secret. Pathetic that you never noticed—truly the folly of youth!”

As he spoke, bright green rays suddenly appeared in midair, weaving into a giant veil that completely enshrouded the Five-Colored Treasure Island.

In an instant, all connection between Yang Kai and his own Sea of Consciousness was severed.

Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. Without hesitation, he wielded his Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure sword and charged at the green veil, intent on shattering it.

“Foolish delusion.” The old man roared angrily. He had expended enormous Divine Sense power and effort to set this defense; there was no way Yang Kai could easily break through.

If the barrier fell, his plan would fail utterly.

He bellowed and spread out his hands. Numerous thin threads shot forth, wrapping and ensnaring Yang Kai.

Turning, Yang Kai slashed at them fiercely — many were cut down, but none shattered the net.

An intense sense of danger descended. The entire Sea of Consciousness shook under the mounting tension and pressure, erupting into chaotic turbulence.

The old man sneered with a look of supreme confidence, calm and collected.

Just as those threads nearly encircled Yang Kai, a staggering pressure suddenly fell.

Both old man and Yang Kai froze in place, as if the crushing weight would grind their Spirit Bodys to dust.

The old man grew horrified, completely bewildered by the sudden terror. Although a beyond the Divine Roaming Realm cultivator, he had never felt such an overwhelming force before.

His ensnaring threads, fired to entangle Yang Kai, vanished like spring snow under the scorching sun.

Although Yang Kai felt some pressure, it was far lighter than that imposed on the old man. This force seemed directed at the old man, with Yang Kai only slightly affected.

Crack—

A crisp sound rang out.

The two within the Sea of Consciousness turned to see, stunned.

Above the Five-Colored Treasure Island, a flat, oval object which had long floated there suddenly split at its very center, revealing a subtle fissure.

Like a tear in the void, this fissure slowly expanded, and as it grew, the oppressive pressure increased, becoming fiercer by the moment.

Winds howled and waves surged within the Sea of Consciousness like never before.

The old man trembled violently, overwhelmed by a tremendous sense of crisis, barely able to stand. His Spirit Body flickered and twisted, emitting a terrible wail.

Yang Kai gazed in shock at the unknown flat oval above the island, his body chilled to the bone.

Since obtaining this object on the seventh page of the Black Book, Yang Kai had long sought to unlock its mystery but failed. Now, at the brink of life-threatening danger, it stirred.

What was this truly?

Yang Kai’s eyes fixed on the fissure unblinkingly.

The fissure opened wider still, and under the mounting pressure, the old man’s carefully constructed barrier shattered like fragile paper.

Moments later, the fissure stopped expanding, and once they could clearly see the object within, both Yang Kai and the old man felt a shudder of dread.

The old man screamed in gut-wrenching agony, “An eye?!”

It was indeed an eye!

A gigantic eye!

When Yang Kai had acquired this thing, he had guessed its true form. He had thought it was a fruit, but it resembled an eye—a tightly shut eye.

Now, that one-eyed orb had opened.

Unlike any normal eye, it was jet black as ink, but with a golden pupil.

It was majestic and terrifying, evoking awe and submission.

Though only a single eye, it stood silently above the Treasure Island, looking down upon the old man with contempt for all living things. To this all-seeing eye, the old man’s beyond the Divine Roaming Realm cultivation was but that of an insignificant ant.

“Boy of the Yang Family, what is this exactly?” The old man screamed wildly, desperately seeking answers from Yang Kai.

Under the gaze of this one-eyed orb, the old man could barely move; his Spirit Body was crushed under tremendous pressure and nearly dissolved.

Yang Kai remained silent, his emotions roiling.

He also did not know what this was.

While the old man struggled, suddenly a golden light shot from the one-eyed orb, striking the old man’s Spirit Body directly.

There was no sound, no reaction. The Spirit Body of a beyond-the-Divine Roaming Realm expert was instantly purified away, leaving only a large mass of pure Divine Sense energy suspended in midair.

Yang Kai was horrified.

After this, the mysterious one-eyed orb slowly closed once more, returning to its eerie and enigmatic state.

Yet Yang Kai faintly sensed that before it shut, the eye had glanced at him, showing a flicker of disappointment mingled with some relief.

The Sea of Consciousness gradually calmed, brilliant sunlight shone, fish swam freely through the waters, and birds flew through the sky.

Yang Kai lingered, but could not delve into the mystery of the eye now. He swiftly withdrew.

At his ear, the startled cries of a group of people rang out.

Looking carefully, these were the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm cultivators of the Eight Great Families.

The stout old man supported the square-faced old man from the Ye Family, calling anxiously, “Brother Ye, Brother Ye, what’s wrong?”

Yang Liting also examined the situation carefully. After a moment, his expression dimmed as he slowly shook his head, “He’s dead.”

Eyes popped in disbelief—neither the warriors of Yang Kai's Mansion nor the coalition of the Seven Great Families dared believe Yang Liting’s words.

Dead… a beyond the Divine Roaming Realm cultivator?

“No injuries at all, no idea what happened.” Yang Liting furrowed his brow, his face full of shock and caution.

The Ye Family’s square-faced expert was nearly equal in strength to him, yet died inexplicably without a single wound. Did his lifespan simply end, or was he covertly murdered?

The former seemed unlikely. Yang Liting had been with him for many years—if his lifespan was truly near its end, a beyond the Divine Roaming Realm cultivator would surely be aware.

He never mentioned it, so it could not have been natural expiration.

Was it assassination? Yang Liting dared not even imagine.

Who could possibly ambush a beyond the Divine Roaming Realm cultivator under so many eyes? No one under heaven had such ability, not even the Evil Lord of the Cangyun Evil Land!

“What happened?” Yang Kai asked deliberately, turning to the Blood Servants nearby.

Tu Feng swallowed nervously, his face pale with fear, “Not sure. We saw nothing—only that the Ye Family’s beyond the Divine Roaming Realm elder suddenly began foaming at the mouth and collapsed, and now he’s dead.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, expression indifferent yet inwardly shaken by the lethality displayed by that golden-pupil one-eyed orb.

A single, casual strike destroyed the Spirit Body of a cultivator beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

The Ye Family elder’s Spirit Body contained his entire consciousness. With its destruction, how could his physical body survive?

What was the true nature of this one-eyed golden pupil?

The atmosphere became heavy.

All present—from the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm members of the Eight Great Families to Meng Wuya, Ling Taixu, and others—furrowed their brows, puzzled by the profound implications.

The Earth Demon chuckled sinisterly, “Don’t foolishly suspect us of foul play. All three of us were in the heavens when it happened. We had no chance—and absolutely no means.”
