## Chapter 709 — Just Playing Around

Going to the city lord's manor to find Zhai Yao and discuss the matter of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was temporarily set aside; in any case, there was no hurry.

The reason Yang Kai agreed to Elder Du's request was twofold. First, Elder Du had treated him well; if Elder Du hadn’t opened all the convenient doors in Giant Stone City, things wouldn’t have gone so smoothly, and it was Elder Du’s introductions that ultimately brought Cang Yan to him.

Second, Yang Kai was genuinely tempted by profit.

He had already gathered many herbs needed for refining a Saint pill, and had even collected an Earthfire Core just two days ago, but a few rare ingredients still remained missing.

Those friends of Elder Du might not necessarily have them, but they could have connections; it would do no harm to make inquiries through them.

Once he collected those remaining ingredients and further improved his pill-refining technique, Yang Kai could return to that snow mountain and extract the Ancient Demon Clan.

On this continent he urgently needed his own cadre and strength.

In the northwest corner of Fuyun City, the vast drill ground was packed with people. Tables were laid out in the center of the field, each separated from the next by at least thirty zhang, and a rough count put the number at a few hundred tables.

These had all been prepared for the alchemists about to participate in the competition.

Outside the drill ground, countless martial artists and alchemists waited quietly, and on the elevated platform at the very front of the field, several white-haired elders were busy attending to matters.

Yang Kai remained calm, showing little nervousness; Mi Na, however, kept exclaiming in astonishment at the grand scene, like a country girl who had never seen the world suddenly entering a magnificent city, everything appearing novel and wondrous.

"Brother Yang!" a call suddenly rang out from nearby.

Yang Kai turned and was surprised to find Zhai Yao was also here; behind him trailed two black-armored warriors whose strength had reached the Transcendent Realm.

It seemed that after the events of the past few days, the city lord's manor had assigned him two bodyguards—care that was exceedingly thorough.

"You’re here too?" Yang Kai smiled; it was indeed a coincidence. Had he really gone straight to the city lord's manor earlier, he might have found no one; coming here turned out to be the right move.

"Came to see the fun," Zhai Yao smiled slightly. "You came to watch the fun as well?"

"I'm entering the competition," Yang Kai explained briefly.

"No way?" Zhai Yao was plainly shocked. "If you enter, what hope is there for the others?"

Among the younger generation of alchemists, reaching Spirit-Grade was already a sign of considerable talent, and such people were extremely rare. Not to mention someone like Yang Kai, who had reached Spirit-Grade Upper-Level.

With that kind of capital entering, it was clearly bullying the others.

"Just playing around," Yang Kai chuckled.

Zhai Yao's eyes gleamed and a look of barely suppressed eagerness appeared on his face. "If you're entering... then I want to enter too."

"Who is this, Yang Kai?" Mi Na's eyes lit up as she stared at Zhai Yao.

"This is the one who fought me for the Earthfire Core a few days ago—Brother Zhai," Yang Kai introduced, then pointed at Du Wan and Mi Na and said, "This is Du Wan, head of the Giant Stone City Alchemists' Association, Elder Du, and the Spirit-Grade Lower-Level alchemist Mi Na."

Zhai Yao's expression turned solemn and he respectfully cupped his fist. "So you're the head of the Giant Stone City Alchemists' Association; junior pays his respects, Elder Du!"

"You know me?" Du Wan smiled kindly.

"My teacher has mentioned you. He said you are one of the few in the world who might reach Saint-Grade Middle-Level in pill refinement!"

Du Wan's expression shifted.

"Sorry, my teacher does not allow me to speak his name," Zhai Yao explained awkwardly.

Du Wan could not help feeling a little disappointed, but quickly composed himself. "It matters not. If your venerable teacher says so, then he must be my senior. Convey a word for Du Wan: in my lifetime I will not disappoint his expectations—I will definitely reach Saint-Grade Middle-Level!"

"I will make sure to deliver it," Zhai Yao said earnestly.

"The young can be feared indeed," Du Wan sighed. "I had thought Young Friend Yang was already the most outstanding young alchemist in the world, but seeing Young Friend Zhai today, I realize my sight was too short; Zhai is not much inferior to Yang."

"Elder Du, how do you know his alchemy can be compared to Yang Kai's?" Mi Na asked, puzzled.

"Heh, alchemists are different from other martial artists; when you are as old as I am you will have the same kind of eye," Du Wan chuckled.

Mi Na glanced at Zhai Yao in astonishment and found him utterly composed, taking Elder Du's praise as a matter of course. She puckered her lips and said in displeasure, "You're handsome enough, but a bit full of yourself."

"Uh, am I?" Zhai Yao looked stunned.

Mi Na nodded and snorted, "I'd like to see whether your alchemy is as great as Yang Kai's, Elder Du—let him sign up too; maybe he's just a fancy pillow, all show and no use."

"Mi Na, be respectful!" Elder Du scolded.

"Fine, if Brother Yang is entering, then I must enter too," Zhai Yao said with a delighted expression. "Elder Du, I'll represent a member of your Alchemists' Association in the competition."

Du Wan smiled wryly and shook his head. "Looks like my old friends are going to bleed heavily."

With Yang Kai already participating, victory was almost guaranteed; now with Zhai Yao joining as well, the others stood no chance.

He silently hoped they would not be too badly crushed.

Zhai Yao wanted to join the spectacle and Yang Kai could do nothing about it—he could only let him make a fool of himself.

After Du Wan went up to the platform to complete the registration, Yang Kai and Zhai Yao each received a number tag.

Unlike the other alchemists, the two men were calm and composed, showing no trace of nervousness or excitement, as if they truly were only here to play.

While they waited, a group approached—led by several elders and followed by some young alchemists.

Yang Kai immediately realized these must be the old friends Elder Du had mentioned.

When they drew near, they greeted one another with smiling faces; the atmosphere among them was cordial.

The old fellows had years of friendship and deep affection; the younger generation, however, glared at one another with intense hostility, creating a tense atmosphere.

The old men could sense this too, and instead of restraining it they continued to provoke the youths with words, as if eager to see chaos.

Yang Kai and Zhai Yao's composure attracted their attention, and they wanted to ask Elder Du about the newcomers' backgrounds; Elder Du only smiled in silence, which only increased the old fools' curiosity.

Suddenly drums and gongs sounded and wind instruments played; the scene grew riotous and the crowd's chatter fell silent.

From the platform came an authoritative voice: "Greetings, everyone. I am Liu Fu, head of the Fuyun City Alchemists' Association. You have all traveled from afar—Liu welcomes your arrival. Regardless of your purpose here today, this place gathers friends from every corner of the land. Taking this opportunity, our Alchemists' Council will hold an Alchemical Competition; please bring forth all your skill and compete with the world's alchemists."

Liu Fu spoke at length, laying out the competition's rules, arrangements, and final rewards.

The appearance of a Saint-Grade pill furnace instantly made countless alchemists' eyes flash greedily.

Mi Na was similarly excited beyond words, her expression one of swearing she would not relent until she seized that Saint-Grade furnace.

After speaking for some time and raising everyone's spirits, Liu Fu swept his gaze about and smiled, shouting, "Now, let the competition begin—please take your assigned number tags and find your stations!"

At his command, several hundred young alchemists surged into the plaza; none were older than forty, all possessing alchemical skill of Mystery-Grade or above, while Spirit-Grade alchemists accounted for only about ten percent.

Yang Kai and Zhai Yao exchanged a glance and strolled toward the center of the square.

They had registered last, so their places were naturally in the final corner; their table had been newly added.

Had Elder Du not interceded, they certainly would not have qualified to participate.

This suited Yang Kai perfectly; he could use the chance to discuss cooperation with Zhai Yao.

On the table lay a Spatial Pouch. Yang Kai picked it up and probed it with his Divine Sense, finding it contained numerous herbs and a pill furnace.

The furnace was Mystery-Grade Middle-Level, and the herbs were of low rank—at best Spirit-Grade. With such constraints most people could perform well, making final evaluations and comparisons more convenient.

The Alchemical Competition consisted of several events; the first was refining medicinal liquids. Within the allotted time, the greater the amount and the higher the grade of liquid refined, the greater the advantage.

One could say everyone's starting point and available capital were completely equal; the final results depended entirely on one's skill.

At Liu Fu's command, the competition officially began.

Yang Kai took out all the herbs, idly twirled a few in his palm, and circulated his True Yuan, refining them with a leisurely expression.

He glanced at Zhai Yao and found him doing the same.

Truly formidable alchemists could split their focus while condensing medicinal liquids; they did not need to refine herb by herb.

Mi Na, in the central area, was also not slow.

Compared with Yang Kai she lacked confidence, but compared with the other alchemists present she was undoubtedly excellent.

True Yuan fire surged forth and the herbs were quickly condensed into medicinal liquid; impurities were removed and her movements were methodical.

"Brother Zhai!" Yang Kai called softly while working. "About the cooperation you mentioned before—"

"Have you considered it?" Zhai Yao whispered back, his hands never slowing.

"I can cooperate, but I want to know—your purpose isn't the medicinal liquid of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, so what exactly are you going there for?"

"Didn't I say? Condensing medicinal liquid benefits you greatly, and it benefits me just the same. I naturally will go to condense medicinal liquid; of course, any liquid I condense will all go to you. Your senior uncle needs it, right?"

"That's correct," Yang Kai nodded, frowning slightly. "If convenient, can you tell me exactly what the benefit is?"

"It's not that it's inconvenient, it's that I can't say," Zhai Yao smiled and shook his head. "My teacher told me to just follow his instructions."
