## Chapter 1269 — Taiqing Mountain Range

"We're nearly there. A thousand li ahead lies the mountain gate of Liuli Gate; you two, stick close to me." Daiyuan turned back to remind them, then again guided her Star Shuttle forward, though this time she did not fly fast, occasionally changing direction as if evading some sort of formation.

Yang Kai understood this well; Liuli Gate was no small power, so it was only natural to lay down formations within a thousand li of the mountain gate. With such funds and strength it was to be expected. But after casting a quick look at Yang Yan and seeing the disdain flash across her face, Yang Kai immediately realized those outer formations must be brittle and worthless, barely worth her notice.

Of course, that was only true for Yang Yan. Yang Kai could sense some subtle energy fluctuations nearby, but he couldn't discern any finer details — if he wanted to break them, it'd only be by brute force.

A thousand li was not a great distance; in the span of barely half an incense stick the three of them flew into the chain of mountains Yang Kai had seen before.

Here, Daiyuan seemed to grow more animated, treating Yang Kai as a guest. She flew abreast with him and volunteered an explanation: "This is the Taiqing Mountain Range under Liuli Gate's control, stretching a hundred thousand li with no fewer than a thousand peaks. Depending on each peak's location and the richness of Spiritual Qi, most are occupied by sect elders and disciples of varying strength and rank. Some peaks are vacant or used for other purposes. At the center of the Taiqing range is where Liuli Gate's disciples congregate most densely; many choose to exchange cultivation insights, trade goods, take on tasks from the sect, or post tasks themselves. I've heard they sometimes look here for suitable companions to travel out together — it sounds rather interesting."

As Daiyuan spoke, a look of longing appeared on her face.

Yang Kai's expression remained unreadable, but he took note of the difference and instantly understood this woman who seemed difficult to approach secretly envied others who could fit easily into group life.

And, as it turned out, she was likely utterly lonely within Liuli Gate.

Yang Kai felt a twinge of melancholy, but said nothing more.

Daiyuan quickly smoothed her features and smiled: "I live on Qianhuan Peak. It's not bustling, but it is peaceful. It's a fine place. Qianhuan Peak is modest in size but enough for me alone; the Spiritual Qi isn't thin. It's considered a mid-to-upper tier peak within the sect."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and stood high in the air, flying forward with Daiyuan while glancing around to take in Liuli Gate's sights. Along the way, the small and large peaks bore evidence of disciples' activity—some practicing Martial Skills, some playing and laughing, some sparring with fellow disciples—full of vigor. Grand edifices crowned slopes and summits: some exquisite and delicate, others majestic and vast, a panorama of splendor.

He couldn't help thinking: no wonder this was a major power on Dark Star; its might truly could not be compared to Dragon Lair Mountain. Even though Dragon Lair Mountain now brimmed with decent Spiritual Qi and seemed prosperous, next to the Taiqing range it felt petty and provincial.

If a single Liuli Gate displayed such grandeur, what of the even stronger sects on Dark Star?

Yang Kai had never been to Yingyue Hall, but he suspected it would not be much inferior.

"I heard your sect has a Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain; it's supposed to be wondrous. Do you know where it is?" Yang Kai asked casually. Since they'd come to see the Glazed Mountain, it was natural to confirm its location. He looked around as he spoke but saw nothing remarkable among the peaks in view — the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain did not seem to be among them.

"Junior Brother Yang actually knows of our Glazed Mountain?" Daiyuan's eyes flashed with surprise.

“Miss Daiyuan, you must find my words laughable. Though I’m a newcomer to this place, your sect’s Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain is so renowned that I’ve naturally heard a little about it. It’s said the entire mountain is formed from Thousand Illusions Glaze—is that truly so?”

At Yang Kai's question about Glazed Mountain, some complexity passed through Daiyuan's eyes; after reflecting for a moment she nodded lightly: "Indeed, the sect's Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain is formed from Thousand Illusions Glaze, a single whole piece whose weight cannot be estimated. Though the material is priceless and everyone knows Liuli Gate has such a treasure mountain, it's laughable — we can't make use of even one ten-thousandth of it, nor can we harvest it in large amounts. Only once every few decades, by special methods, can a tiny amount be collected."

This matched what Yang Yan had told Yang Kai earlier, so he was not surprised.

"Special methods of collection?" Yang Kai asked as if by accident.

An embarrassed expression appeared on Daiyuan's face.

Yang Kai gave a light chuckle and said lightly, "Looks like I've asked something I shouldn't. Well, Daiyuan, pretend you didn't hear me."

Daiyuan offered an apologetic smile: "It's not that I won't speak, it's just that the method is one of the sect's core secrets. No one may reveal it. If it were leaked, unimaginable punishments would follow. Please forgive me, Junior Brother."

"No matter, it was my impertinence."

Perhaps feeling guilty, Daiyuan hesitated then offered: "Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain isn't on this side, but if we take a detour we could see it from afar. If Junior Brother Yang doesn't mind, why not take a look?"

She clearly sought to make amends; Yang Kai would have jumped at the chance, but he feigned hesitation and weighed his words: "Wouldn't that be improper? Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain is the sect's treasure; if visiting it would bring trouble to you, Miss Daiyuan, then no need. I am merely curious — to broaden my sights… heh."

As Yang Kai forced a laugh, Yang Yan quietly stood behind him and pinched him, plainly reproving him.

Such a small movement could not hide from Daiyuan; her pretty eyes turned toward Yang Yan and she smiled at her before saying, "There's nothing improper about it; we'll only look from afar. Those uncles and aunts stationed there to guard it won't begrudge a glance. Brother Yang Kai, follow me."

Saying that, she immediately changed direction and flew to one side.

Yang Kai glared at Yang Yan, then hurried to catch up. Yang Yan tossed her head in an indifferent display.

They had not flown far when several azure rays suddenly shot toward them.

Shortly after, those azure lights solidified into five people before Yang Yan and the others: three men and two women, none very powerful — two at Saint Realm and three at Transcendent Realm.

Such cultivation stood atop the Tongxuan Continent, but on Dark Star it was nothing special.

Upon recognizing Daiyuan, the five were surprised. They clasped their fists and respectfully greeted, "Senior Aunt Daiyuan! We pay our respects!"

Hearing them call her Senior Aunt, Yang Kai in the rear wore a puzzled expression.

But then he thought it through and was relieved.

Although Daiyuan was a young disciple of Liuli Gate, in comparison to the Origin Returning Realm's top experts she still ranked as someone who could be a Senior Aunt to these five. Given her cultivation and standing, she had every qualification for the title.

After the salutations, the speaker looked over Yang Kai and Yang Yan. Yang Yan drew no reaction, but upon seeing Yang Kai he showed surprise and astonishment.

"Is this the area you five are tasked with guarding?" Daiyuan inclined her head slightly and asked coldly.

"Reporting, Senior Aunt, this area spans fifty li and is under our watch," the lead warrior answered. After hesitating he dared to ask carefully, "May I inquire, Senior Aunt, who are these two?"

"They are my guests; you needn't concern yourselves. If any elders ask, simply say that."

"Yes!" The leader dared not press the matter and immediately made way with the other four.

Daiyuan said nothing and strode past with Yang Kai and Yang Yan.

Only after their figures vanished did the five look at each other, faces full of doubt.

"Is that Senior Aunt Daiyuan who lives on Qianhuan Peak?" one woman in a pale yellow dress, appearing in her late teens, asked.

"Yes, that's the one who resides on Qianhuan Peak."

“I heard she was supposed to be of peerless beauty—so how come she looks…”

"Sh!" The lead warrior glared and, after checking nobody else was near, scolded sharply, "You'd dare make such remarks? Do you want to lose your life?"

The woman's face paled as if she had recalled something, suddenly filled with fear.

The leading cultivator let out a faint sigh. “You few entered the sect later, so what you’ve heard are mostly rumors, not the real truth. But be warned—don’t go prying into such matters. You might unwittingly offend a taboo, and if that happens, you’ll never rise within the sect for the rest of your lives. Understand?”

"Understood." The other four nodded repeatedly, wearing chastened expressions.

"Still… it's strange Senior Aunt Daiyuan would receive guests. That's odd," the warrior murmured, shaking his head in puzzlement.

After all, the one who lived on Qianhuan Peak never left the sect, seldom socialized, and no one had heard of any disciple getting close to her, especially a male!

That such a person would bring a male friend back naturally filled them with suspicion.

He only mulled it over casually; it wasn't his place to ask. He planned to report honestly if the elders inquired, and that would settle it.

With that thought, he waved his hand and resumed patrol with the other four.
