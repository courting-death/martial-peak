## Chapter 1921 — Dark Star

The two of them were now inside a great hall that exuded an ancient air; it was clearly old, and because no one had come or gone for years and it had been left to decay, signs of long-term damage showed around the hall.

Within the hall, at least a hundred skeletal remains sat cross-legged, scattered about the chamber.

Those bones had long since lost the breath of life and all flesh; even their clothes had been weathered away by wind and time, leaving only pale bones—some still roughly human-shaped, others strewn across the floor in a grisly sight.

After confirming there was no immediate danger nearby, Ai Ou's gaze fell upon the surrounding skeletons; his eyes dimmed and he sighed, “These should be the disciples of my Commerce Guild who weren't able to evacuate back then.”

Back when that Space Array suddenly broke down, some cultivators who were still mining on this ore star couldn't make it back to Shuiyue Star in time; ten thousand years passed, and the ore star was unsuitable for training, so their cultivation stalled and they naturally died here of old age.

Over a hundred had died inside this hall alone—one could imagine how many more had perished outside.

That time the Hengluo Commerce Guild suffered heavy losses; records say the missing disciples numbered over five thousand!

That meant five thousand of the Hengluo Commerce Guild's disciples had died upon this ore star.

“My condolences.” Yang Kai did not know how to comfort him; seeing Ai Ou so downcast, he could only offer the phrase.

Ai Ou forced a bitter smile. “I know. It was already ten thousand years ago. I only feel that the Commerce Guild has been ungrateful to them; they shed their life’s blood here, and after ten thousand years hardly anyone remembers them.”

“People will remember them in time. They died here likely to guard the array. By preventing external forces from destroying it, what they did is itself a tremendous merit.”

“How do you mean?” Ai Ou asked, startled.

Yang Kai grinned slightly. “Put it this way: to transmit across stars you must have two connected Space Arrays. If either is damaged you cannot teleport. The array in Shuiyue Star City was broken, but after I repaired it we could teleport here—meaning the array on this side remained intact. I was worried that if this array had been damaged I would have to go alone into the Void Passage to repair the transmission node, which would be dangerous, but that didn't happen. That shows they protected this array well even as they died. For the Commerce Guild, isn't that a great deed? Senior, you should record them and let future generations venerate them.”

Ai Ou looked enlightened and nodded repeatedly. “You are right. Though I don't know their names, they truly are heroes of the Commerce Guild. Posterity should remember their merits.”

When people face despair and death they can become insane and do irrational things, yet the hundreds who died in this hall did not go mad and destroy the Space Array; they guarded it to the end, likely hoping someone would one day come from Shuiyue Star to save them.

Unfortunately, that wait lasted ten thousand years—and they had long since become bones.

Ai Ou's expression suddenly grew solemn. He stepped down from the array and approached the hundred or so skeletons. In a respectful tone he declared, “I am Ai Ou, current president of the Hengluo Commerce Guild. Your deeds—Ai Ou will record them in the annals; you may die with honor. Although I am late, today I will take you home and grant you burial. If I offend any of you, I beg the departed to forgive me.”

Saying that, he produced an empty Spatial Ring, waved it carefully, and circulated Saint Yuan to draw one skeleton into the ring.

Then a second, a third…

It took the time of half an incense stick before Ai Ou had collected all the bones.

He turned to Yang Kai. “I'll go out and search for other disciples; you can look around as you please. This is an ore star—perhaps you'll find something of value. Don't be modest; anything you find is your own fortune.”

“Alright, then we'll meet back here in a month. I still have matters to discuss with you.”

Ai Ou nodded, and in a flash of movement he vanished from sight.

After he left, Yang Kai followed and exited the hall as well.

Gazing about, this ore star was extremely similar to the one he had once discovered by chance—dark, damp, with thin Spiritual Qi; it was unsuitable for cultivators yet hid exceedingly rich mineral deposits.

Lingxiao Sect now relied on the reserves from that ore star and had become immensely wealthy. If the Hengluo Commerce Guild could develop this ore star, their finances would certainly rise another level.

Thinking of that ore star stirred Yang Kai; with a wave of his hand he released both Xiaoxiao and the Fire Bird.

“Master, any orders?” Liu Yan retained her sultry form—her fair, lotus-like arm exposed, clad in a scarlet garment that barely reached her midriff, her delicate navel highly alluring.

Yang Kai glanced at her, shook his head, and looked at the Stone Puppet. “Xiaoxiao, is there anything here you like?”

Yang Kai's question was almost rhetorical: from the moment Xiaoxiao was released it had its black-bean eyes wide and scanned around, looking delightedly simple-minded; Yang Kai knew that was its excited state.

For the Stone Puppet folk, born to refine mineral essences for their own use, an ore star was paradise. Given enough time they could even swallow and refine an entire ore star.

No sooner had Yang Kai finished speaking than Xiaoxiao bobbed its head like a pecking chick.

Yang Kai smiled and asked softly, “Is there any remaining Origin left?”

Last time on that ore star, Xiaoxiao had swallowed some remaining Stellar Origin and fallen into a dormant evolution; though its strength did not increase upon awakening, it could now ignore the Domain Field of the Void King Realm.

That was another form of strengthening.

If it could swallow some more remaining Origin here, Xiaoxiao would surely grow.

The Stellar Origin on an ore star differed from that of a Cultivation Star: the ore star's Origin was severely damaged, leaving thin Spiritual Qi and unsuited for cultivators; whether there was any left mattered little.

As long as the mineral deposits remained, the ore star's value would not diminish.

But a Cultivation Star was different: each cultivation star housed tens of millions of residents, and without the power of Origin it would soon become a Dead Star, dooming its millions of inhabitants.

The same applied to Medicine Stars.

A Medicine Star's Spiritual Qi was even richer than that of a typical Cultivation Star, because only with abundant Spiritual Qi could Spiritual Medicine grow rapidly.

Hearing Yang Kai's question, Xiaoxiao looked puzzled, scratched its head, and stared at him with a clueless expression.

“You fool — it’s the thing you swallowed last time that made you fall asleep.” Liu Yan tapped Xiaoxiao’s little head, a crisp ‘ding’ ringing out.

Now Xiaoxiao understood and its eyes brightened; it nodded eagerly.

“Go and swallow it. Don't let any good things on the way slip by. When it's about done, come wait for me here.” Yang Kai smiled faintly and gestured.

Xiaoxiao obeyed, flipped once in midair, and its tiny body slipped into the ground as if through nothingness, quickly disappearing.

In Yang Kai's Divine Sense he felt it dive a hundred li underground in an exceptionally short time, burrowing ever deeper at great speed—clearly searching for the remaining Origin.

“Master, what should I do?” Liu Yan asked.

“You can look around too, see if there's a fortune suited to you. Places left untouched for ten thousand years ought to have something good; perhaps something is waiting for you to take.”

“Do you need me to stay by your side?”

“No.” Yang Kai shook his head, then suddenly seemed to notice something and stared at Liu Yan in surprise. “Your intelligence…”

The Liu Yan of before seemed not to act on her own or ask such questions, but today she behaved somewhat differently.

Liu Yan also paused and frowned prettily, looking bewildered.

Yang Kai smiled slightly. “It seems constantly refining the Sun’s True Fire has truly helped your growth. Pity… Xiaoxiao was born with low sentience, otherwise it too would grow ever smarter. Work hard; if one day you obtain a fortune, I'll find a way to give you a flesh body so you need not remain an energy being.”

Liu Yan's beautiful eyes suddenly shone; she bowed gracefully. “Then Liu Yan thanks Master in advance.”

Yang Kai waved his hand; Liu Yan uttered a soft cry and transformed into a vast Fire Bird, a blaze of living flame, streaking toward the horizon.

After the two great aides had departed, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and probed the condition of the Incarnation within the Xuan Realm Pearl.

The Incarnation, like Xiaoxiao, could swallow and refine minerals to strengthen itself.

But the Incarnation had just refined the entire Floating Continent and was still digesting; its mountain-sized form was awe-inspiring.

Seeing that, Yang Kai knew it was not the time to release it.

With that he vaulted into the air and flew upward.

This was a Dark Star, a star hidden by a Heaven-and-Earth strange array; the minerals here held little value for Yang Kai, but the array that concealed the Dark Star warranted investigation.

If he could glean even a hint from that formation, Yang Kai would profit immensely.

Looking up, the sky was dim, unlike any Cultivation Star: there were no sun, moon, or stars, not even starlight—only faint glimmers poured down through the firmament. Whatever that light was, it kept the ore star from complete darkness.

The whole heaven and earth seemed covered by an invisible lid, forming a world unto itself.

Yang Kai rose to tens of thousands of li and stopped, for he could feel the strange array exerting enormous power here; to press on recklessly upward would inevitably trigger a lethal formation.

Such a killing formation might not even be avoidable by him—it was the wrath of heaven and earth, the might of the laws.
