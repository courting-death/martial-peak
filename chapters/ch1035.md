## Chapter 1035 — Relic

Outside Shen Tu's palace, Jia Long pointed at Yang Kai and said, "Young Master Yang wants to buy some things; accompany him and ensure his safety."

"A guest of Young Master Shen Tu?" the yao expert turned his gaze to Yang Kai and inclined his head, "No problem."

He had evidently also heard of Yang Kai.

After all, Shen Tu rarely brought guests to his palace; anyone he brought back was invariably someone he held in special regard.

"Please come with me," he invited Yang Kai.

"Much obliged," Yang Kai replied with a faint smile.

Trailing behind this yao expert, they sped along; he seemed taciturn, not given to much talk.

Yang Kai had to take the initiative to ask, "How should I address you, friend?"

This yao expert was unquestionably a Saint King Realm powerhouse, for whenever Yang Kai faced him he felt an inexplicable pressure that only someone of the Saint King Realm could exert.

But since he served Shen Tu, it wouldn't be out of place for Yang Kai to call him 'friend.'

"Don't flatter me, you can just call me Xue Tong."

"Xue Tong?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "Which branch of the yao are you from?"

"The Blood-Eyed Mane Clan!" Xue Tong explained offhand.

Only then did Yang Kai notice his eyes were indeed unusual, showing a faint red in ordinary state — a color that, once truly roused in battle, would flare into a crimson so fierce he would become berserk and his combat strength would surge.

"You are human, yet I sense yao yuan in you... and your bloodline seems purer, nobler than mine — it has the aura of a yao emperor! Have you ever had some odd encounter related to the yao?" Xue Tong frowned and looked at Yang Kai.

"Yes, a little," Yang Kai smiled faintly.

The golden dragon and Ice Phoenix patterns on his body indeed bore traces of yao; it was natural those traces could be perceived. The Golden Dragon and Ice Phoenix were emperors among the yao, a fact that held true even across the Starry Void.

Xue Tong said no more, but, seemingly drawn closer by the yao yuan qi emanating from Yang Kai, his expression softened and became kinder.

Before long they arrived at a city where streaks of azure rainbows flickered across the sky, and many martial artists swaggered about, piloting Star Shuttles.

Xue Tong led the way with practiced ease, asking as they walked, "What are you looking to buy?"

"A decent Star Shuttle, and some rare ore!" Yang Kai answered.

"That won't be hard to obtain," Xue Tong mused. "Do you want to buy here or go elsewhere?"

"Is there a difference?" Yang Kai asked.

"This city on Shuiyue Star isn't particularly prosperous; the goods aren't very high-end. If you want a Star Shuttle, I suggest a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Star Shuttle — a craft of that grade will let you barely exploit its speed, and it will serve you a very long time."

"Then a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Star Shuttle it is!" Yang Kai nodded.

"We'll have to go to another city about thirty thousand li away; that's where the good stock is."

"That's rather far," Yang Kai frowned. Thirty thousand li would still take a good while even on a Star Shuttle.

Xue Tong gave a mysterious smile. "Not too far — we can be there immediately."

Yang Kai was puzzled but didn't press; he followed as Xue Tong threaded through the city.

Before long they stood before a building. Even before entering, Yang Kai felt a strange rippling of power emanating from within; it felt peculiar. He probed it, and instantly understood what the disturbance was.

It was the force of the void.

He could not fathom why such force should appear here.

Outside the building, many guards of the Hengluo Commerce Guild stood posted, and upon seeing Xue Tong they all saluted. They seemed to recognize him and knew he was Shen Tu's bodyguard.

Xue Tong strode straight inside.

Passing through several gates, the ripples of void force grew steadily stronger.

When they reached the innermost chamber, Yang Kai couldn't help narrowing his eyes and cried out, "A Space Array?"

Before him stood a grand formation whose layout was almost identical to the one the Ghost Ancestor had arranged on the Floating Continent; the only differences were in tiny details. The Ghost Ancestor's skill in setting up Space Arrays had lacked refinement in places, leaving many spots imperfect.

The Space Array before them, however, had been arranged with absolute rigor, flawless in every aspect. At the center of the formation stood a mirror-like surface covered with a thick layer of Ethereal Crystal.

The mirror's base contained several slots — clearly meant for Saint Crystals.

"Can this thing be used?" Yang Kai asked Xue Tong in astonishment.

"Of course. Through this Space Array we can reach that more prosperous city!" Xue Tong replied.

"Aren't these said to be lost arts?" Yang Kai's eyes gleamed with interest.

"They are indeed lost, but remnants of Space Arrays remain on many cultivation stars. No one knows who laid them or when; people can use them now but cannot penetrate their secrets. A few experts might be able to decipher parts of them, but that is beyond our reach."

At his explanation, Yang Kai immediately understood — these Space Arrays must be relics left from a very long time ago.

"With such things, couldn't one easily travel between different cultivation stars?" Yang Kai exclaimed; he knew how vast the distances between cultivation stars were and how long a round trip could take, but with Space Arrays it would be nothing more than an instant.

Xue Tong smiled rarely and shook his head. "That's impossible. Any Space Array's teleportation distance tops out at one hundred thousand li; each star's arrays can only be used within that star and cannot link to other cultivation stars."

Saying this, he took several high-quality Saint Crystals from his Spatial Ring and carefully placed them into the slots on the base, then beckoned Yang Kai, "Please, come."

Yang Kai stepped forward and stood at his side.

Xue Tong activated his power and the Space Array stirred. The mirror's surface rippled like a placid lake as waves spread outward, and the Saint Crystals embedded in the base began to drain their energy rapidly.

After a moment, the mirror shattered, revealing a pitch-black void.

"Go!" Xue Tong barked, diving in first.

Yang Kai followed without hesitation.

Unlike the sensation of tearing through the void on his own, Yang Kai felt little as he passed through the Space Array; he crossed the mirror and arrived at another place.

Looking back, he saw there was a Space Array at this location as well, but it was by no means the same as the one they had just left.

Yang Kai's heart filled with understanding — the two Space Arrays were linked by a special connection, temporarily opening a stable Void Passage between the sites and allowing instantaneous teleportation across tens of thousands of li.

All of these Space Arrays were the property of the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

Xue Tong smiled and said, "Although Space Arrays are convenient, cultivators rarely use them frequently."

"Why is that?"

"The power of space is too abstruse. Frequent shuttling between two places with a Space Array can cause unnecessary harm. So unless one is well-versed in spatial mysteries, we only use them every few months; most travel is done by Star Shuttle."

"Understood," Yang Kai smiled. "So we'll have to fly back later, then?"

"Indeed," Xue Tong nodded. "Come, I'll take you to a good place. The masters there craft the finest Star Shuttles on Shuiyue Star; you should be able to find one that suits you."

Yang Kai's anticipation rose.

This city was indeed far more prosperous than the previous one. All manner of shops lined the streets and countless martial artists swarmed through them like schools of fish, each belonging to different powers. Here Yang Kai saw cultivators from the Sword Alliance and Purple Star, as well as many from other, lesser-known factions.

Being the Hengluo Commerce Guild's main star, this was the busiest trading hub throughout the Star Domain.

The great powers scattered across the Star Domain all stationed representatives here; when they needed supplies they negotiated purchases with the Hengluo Commerce Guild, who then delivered the goods.

One by one, supply-laden warships launched from a section of the city and flew into the Starry Sky, gradually vanishing from sight.

Yang Kai felt the city's booming prosperity in full, and his mood was subtly uplifted.

Following Xue Tong, the two soon arrived at a multi-story shop. The moment they entered, someone came forward, clasped fists and smiled, "Lord Xue Tong, long time no see — has Young Master Shen Tu need of anything this time?"

Xue Tong shook his head. "It's Young Master's guest who wants a Star Shuttle. Take us to the third floor."

The man glanced at Yang Kai, immediately nodded and bowed, gesturing, "This way, please!"

Yang Kai looked around and discovered the shop sold nothing but Star Shuttles; a row of finished Star Shuttles sat on the counters and many martial artists lingered to haggle with the clerks.

From time to time someone left the shop satisfied.

"This is also one of our guild's businesses. The Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Star Shuttles you want are sold on the third floor; the first and second floors aren't of high enough grade," Xue Tong explained as he led the way.

Yang Kai nodded lightly; he noticed the shuttles on the first floor were only Spirit-Grade, and the buyers there weren't particularly powerful — many were of the Transcendent Realm and some poor Saint Realm cultivators.

Spirit-Grade Star Shuttles were bottom-tier in both speed and performance; such crafts couldn't even break free of their star's shackles and could not travel into the Star Domain.

Nor could they withstand the heavenly forces present within a Star Domain.

Seeing the clerk enthusiastically escort Yang Kai and Xue Tong to the upper floors, others cast surprised glances, wondering which lord had arrived.

The second floor displayed Saint-Grade Star Shuttles whose energy ripples were noticeably stronger than those downstairs and even superior to the one Yang Kai himself owned.

Many martial artists bought on this level; the clerks were kept overwhelmingly busy.
