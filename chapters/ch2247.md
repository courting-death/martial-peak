## Chapter 2247 — Brimming With Tears

The Law Power within the Small Xuan Realm was still not complete. Although on the third layer of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda the Small Xuan Realm had absorbed many Law fragments, its world laws remained incomplete and couldn't compare to the Law Power of the Star Realm.

For someone of Hua Qingsi’s cultivation, there was usually no problem cultivating and comprehending in the Small Xuan Realm.

But if she wanted to break through, the Small Xuan Realm would not be suitable. Because the laws were incomplete, the Martial Dao she could perceive during her breakthrough would not meet the requirements.

However, when that time came, Yang Kai would certainly let her out, find a safe and proper place for her to break through in peace. By then, Yang Kai would have an Emperor Realm-level powerhouse under his command…

Just thinking about it was enough to excite him.

Zhang Ruoxi had also been making rapid progress these days. Now, her cultivation had reached the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

All the so-called prodigies, every peerless genius, when compared to her cultivation speed, were like fireflies competing with the bright moon.

It seemed that something inside Zhang Ruoxi was gradually awakening, and as this power awakened, her cultivation speed grew faster and faster. Her entire temperament was also slowly changing—less delicate and timid, more confident and strong.

This was something Yang Kai was happy to see.

About two months after returning from the Divine Roaming Mirror world, on this day, Yang Kai was in his cave dwelling refining the Soul-Severing Blade with a Heaven-Shattering Strike, when he suddenly sensed a slight disturbance in the cave’s barrier.

His mind stirred, and he quickly ceased his technique. Letting his spirit body return to his flesh, he raised his token and gave it a shake, dissolving the barrier’s restriction.

Immediately, a voice came from outside: “Young Master Yang, Young Master Yang!”

The voice sounded familiar. Yang Kai thought for a moment and immediately realized who it was.

He replied, “Deacon Tao, please come in.”

Outside the cave, Tao Ming, who had had some friction with Yang Kai a few months ago, straightened his expression and stepped into the cave.

Soon, he arrived at the secret chamber. But at this moment, Tao Ming no longer had his former arrogance. His face was full of smiles, and he cupped his fists obsequiously to Yang Kai: “Forgive me for disturbing your cultivation, Young Master Yang. I am truly at fault.”

Yang Kai glanced at him and said indifferently, “Who sent you? Is there some news?”

Tao Ming straightened his face and said, “By order of the Hall Master, I have come to inform Young Master Yang that the thing you needed… has been found.”

Yang Kai shot to his feet, his eyes flashing with light, and asked in a low voice, “Truly?”

Tao Ming smiled and said, “The Hall Master personally gave the order. How could it be false?”

“Excellent, it’s finally been found.” Yang Kai’s face was full of joy.

Although Tao Ming hadn’t told him exactly what had been found, what else could it be but the Calamity Fruit?

These days, although Yang Kai had been refining the Slave-Insect Bracelet, raising Soul-Devouring Worms, and nurturing the Soul-Severing Blade, he had always been thinking about the Calamity Fruit. It was just that the agreed time hadn’t arrived, so he hadn’t pressed the matter.

Now, at last, news had come.

He couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief, his whole body relaxing, as if a burden he had carried for a long time had finally been lifted.

After all, the Calamity Fruit concerned Qin Yu’s very life and death.

After all, all the fortuitous encounters he had gained over these past few months had been secured for him by Qin Chaoyang using the Mortal Great Emperor Token.

If he couldn’t obtain the Calamity Fruit, he would truly have no face to meet Qin Chaoyang, nor could he give the Qin Family an explanation.

This matter would surely become an obsession in his heart, perhaps even turning into a heart demon in the future.

But now, these worries were gone. Since Wen Zishan had sent Tao Ming to deliver the message, it meant the Calamity Fruit was already in hand.

In this way, he could bring the spirit fruit back to Fenglin City and hand it over to the Qin Family, resolving a knot in his heart.

Seeing his joy, Tao Ming, though not knowing what Yang Kai was looking for, was happy for him and flattered him with a few words.

“By the way, Deacon Tao, did the Hall Master say where the item is now?” Yang Kai asked, coming back to his senses.

Tao Ming replied, “The Hall Master said the item is already on its way. It will be brought back within three days at most. You can rest assured, nothing will go wrong.”

“Good, good, good. Please thank Hall Master Wen for me.” Yang Kai said solemnly, cupping his fists.

“If Young Master Yang has no other instructions, I will take my leave.” Tao Ming said with a smile.

“Take care, Deacon Tao!”

After sending Tao Ming off, Yang Kai had no mind to do anything else. Wen Zishan probably just wanted to put him at ease, so he had someone deliver the news early. But he probably didn’t expect Yang Kai to care so much about the Calamity Fruit…

He waited in his cave dwelling, sitting on pins and needles, for three days. Early one morning, Yang Kai left Purple Bamboo Peak and headed straight for Ten Thousand Saints Peak.

Arriving at the main hall atop the peak, before he could even ask someone to announce him, Wen Zishan’s voice came from inside: “Come in.”

Yang Kai was taken aback, but not surprised. He straightened his clothes and stepped inside.

Inside the hall, there was no one else—only Wen Zishan, sitting cross-legged, seemingly circulating some profound art.

Yang Kai entered but did not disturb him, simply waiting quietly.

Yet his heart was full of emotion.

Wen Zishan was already at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, his strength extraordinary, yet he was still so diligent, never slacking off.

For a martial artist, having talent was not frightening. What was frightening was having both talent and working even harder.

Wen Zishan was undoubtedly such a person. His rise to the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm was certainly no accident.

After a while, Wen Zishan finished his cultivation, opened his eyes, and looked at Yang Kai with a teasing smile: “What’s wrong? Can’t wait any longer?”

Yang Kai replied awkwardly, “The sooner I see it, the sooner I can be at ease.”

“You’re a man of deep feelings and loyalty!” Wen Zishan nodded. “That Mortal Great Emperor Token from the Qin Family was not wasted.”

“A promise must be kept. It’s only human nature.” Yang Kai replied.

Wen Zishan nodded slightly, pondered for a moment, then said, “About what Xueting mentioned to you last time, have you considered it?”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly and said, “So it was Hall Master Wen who had Elder Gao try to persuade me?”

“It was my idea, but Xueting also thinks highly of you.” Wen Zishan admitted frankly. “Besides, you even entered the Divine Roaming Mirror, so you’re half a disciple of my Shrine now, aren’t you? That’s a secret even most disciples don’t know.”

Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn. He pondered for a long time, as if weighing his words, and finally said, “I am grateful for Hall Master Wen’s and Elder Gao’s kindness, but I have no intention of joining any Sect for now. It’s not that I dislike the Shrine, just… there are some reasons I can’t speak of.”

What he meant, of course, was the matter of the demonic intent.

Wen Zishan gazed at him deeply and nodded. “Very well, I won’t force you. But… if one day you grow tired of wandering outside, come to my Shrine. The doors will always be open for you!”

Yang Kai was moved, and bowed deeply. “Thank you for your kindness, Hall Master Wen. If that day ever comes, it will be my honor!”

Wen Zishan grinned. “I was the same as you back then. Loved being alone, loved freedom, loved roaming outside, until…” His mouth twitched, and he continued, “Until I picked up a little girl fighting a wild cat for food in the wilderness.”

Instantly, the image of Gao Xueting appeared in Yang Kai’s mind.

“When you travel the Star Realm in the future, you can pick up anything, but never pick up those little girls!” Wen Zishan said earnestly, full of advice. “Those little girls, when they’re young, seem cute and obedient, well-behaved and sweet. But when they grow up, they become utterly lawless, completely outrageous. Just speaking of this now… it brings tears to my eyes!”

He looked utterly wounded, leaving Yang Kai speechless.

“Brings tears to your eyes, doesn't it!” Suddenly, a cold, icy voice came from outside the hall. As the voice sounded, the temperature in the hall plummeted, as if it were the depths of winter, making one’s skin tingle with cold.

Wen Zishan jolted as if struck by lightning, instantly freezing in place like he’d been hit by a petrification spell. His expression shifted through a dazzling array of emotions, each more colorful than the last.

As the words fell, a beautiful figure strode in from outside.

Gao Xueting’s face was cold, her beautiful eyes flashing like thunder and lightning as she swept her gaze inside.

Wen Zishan immediately shrank by half, and even Yang Kai couldn’t help but shiver.

Killing intent filled the air, Emperor Intent chilling to the bone.

“Utterly lawless, is it?” Gao Xueting’s lips curled up as she snorted coldly.

“This… that…” Cold sweat poured down Wen Zishan’s face like a waterfall. He stammered, his eyes darting about, trying to change the subject, and said with a fawning smile, “Xueting, why are you here? You came without letting anyone know, that’s not proper, is it?”

Gao Xueting said coldly, “Delivering the Calamity Fruit!”

As she spoke, she tossed a jade box to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He reached out to catch it, flicked his finger, and opened the jade box.

Cold air poured out from within. A spirit fruit, crystalline as ice, lay quietly inside.

The Calamity Fruit!

Although Yang Kai had never seen the real thing, he recognized it at a glance. Judging by its appearance, it seemed to have been freshly picked—not long ago. If he was right, it should be the one from the Winter Domain of the Four Seasons Land.

Who knew from which force Qingyang Shrine had obtained it? But after so much time, it seemed Qingyang Shrine had put in a lot of effort.

“Completely outrageous, is it?” Gao Xueting had no intention of letting things go. After handing the spirit fruit to Yang Kai, she continued to glare coldly at Wen Zishan, her gaze as sharp as a blade, as piercing as a sword.

Wen Zishan gritted his teeth, put on the look of a hero sacrificing himself, and shouted to Yang Kai, “This is bad! I, the Hall Master, will leave first. Boy Yang, you take care of yourself. Remember, if you ever run into trouble, come to the Shrine!”

Before Yang Kai could even thank him, Wen Zishan’s figure flickered and disappeared on the spot.

“Trying to run?” A cold light flashed in Gao Xueting’s beautiful eyes. The Imperial Treasure, Scorching Sun Mirror, instantly appeared, and a blazing beam of light shot into the void. In a flash, Wen Zishan’s figure flickered within it. Although Gao Xueting had found his whereabouts, Hall Master Wen still broke free from the Scorching Sun Mirror’s restraint with his extraordinary strength and escaped in the blink of an eye.

“Don’t run, old man! Today I’ll show you what it means to be utterly lawless and completely outrageous!” Gao Xueting gritted her teeth, stomped her foot, and chased after him in a flash.

Outside the hall, the many guarding disciples stood with their mouths agape, dumbfounded by the scene.

Yang Kai stood there holding the jade box, grinning as he watched the farce unfold. But as he laughed, his smile slowly faded. Slapping his thigh in frustration, he muttered, “I forgot to ask about the Shattered Star Sea again!”
