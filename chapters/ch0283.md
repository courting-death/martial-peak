## Chapter 283 — True Alchemy Formula

The first five pages of the Wordless Black Book were devoid of anything except for an incense burner.

Taking out the incense burner, he poured in True Yuan onto the sixth page.

Suddenly, intricate patterns emerged on the dark page. These patterns were clearly a formation, but they were entirely different from those on the fifth page. As True Yuan flowed in, the patterns twisted and writhed, greedily absorbing Yang Kai's True Yuan like a whale gulping water.

The formation's patterns flickered continuously.

In no time, his True Yuan was nearly depleted.

Yang Kai directly detonated a drop of Yang Liquid within his Dantian, replenishing his dried-up meridians and continuing to pour in more.

After expending a total of ten precious drops of Yang Liquid, the sixth page finally seemed to reach saturation. With the transformation of the patterns, the first six pages suddenly merged into one, forming a whole.

As his Divine Sense probed into it, Yang Kai smiled with satisfaction.

It had been two or three years since he obtained this Wordless Black Book. Although he had long known it was made from Soul-Calming Stone, only now could it exhibit its most basic function.

Soul-Calming Stone was indeed a treasure that could be used to create storage items.

Storage treasures, these were things that only existed in legends. Ever since Yang Kai obtained the Wordless Black Book, he had been anticipating when it would truly allow him to store items.

Especially a year ago when he went to another place for training, Ling Taixu had given him a Spatial Pouch, which further showcased the convenience and speed of storage treasures.

Having a decent storage treasure could save a lot of trouble.

And now, his wish had finally been fulfilled.

The sixth page of the black book granted him the ability to activate the storage function of the Wordless Black Book. The first six pages merged into a vast space.

Unlike the limited space of the Spatial Pouch, this space was enormous, comparable to dozens of rooms. It could contain anything in the world, except for living beings.

Moreover, if he were to unlock the pages behind the Wordless Black Book in the future, he could also integrate those useless pages to further expand the size of the space.

His Divine Sense wandered within this vast space. Yang Kai clicked his tongue in wonder.

With such a large space, he naturally need not worry about not being able to store the contents of that well.

After a moment, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense, holding the Wordless Black Book in one hand while gathering and controlling True Yuan with the other. He precisely and delicately extracted Wan Yao Ling Ye from the well and placed it into the Wordless Black Book.

Each drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye was incredibly precious. Yang Kai's movements were cautious and meticulous, fearing even a single drop might spill.

Fortunately, during this time, he had learned methods to control Yuan Qi from Xiao Fusheng, greatly improving his control over True Yuan. Doing such tasks was naturally much easier.

At first, Yang Kai was extremely careful, but as time passed, his movements gradually sped up. By the end, he was tossing Wan Yao Ling Ye directly into the space of the Wordless Black Book with one hand, barely bothering to look at it.

This busy work lasted a full six or seven hours.

Yang Kai was left sore and exhausted, his movements having become entirely mechanical.

The Wan Yao Ling Ye he extracted weighed over a thousand pounds.

Looking into the well, at half a zhang deep, a layer of something appeared, which was denser than Wan Yao Ling Ye and still milky white, but in a semi-solid state.

Wan Yao Ling Milk!

This was a higher-grade existence compared to Wan Yao Ling Ye.

This well had existed for many years, and the people of Yao Wang Valley had continuously poured various pills into the Wan Yao Pool for thousands of years. The energy of those pills settled into this well, with the most refined parts sinking to the bottom, making the lower layers older and more effective.

Looking at the Wan Yao Ling Milk below, Yang Kai took a deep breath and gritted his teeth to continue collecting.

After another three or four hours, he finally finished extracting the Wan Yao Ling Milk. Although it was not as abundant as Wan Yao Ling Ye, he still managed to gather at least two to three hundred pounds.

The efficacy of Wan Yao Ling Milk was double that of the spirit liquid.

In other words, with this, Xiao Fusheng could truly refine Spirit Realm pills. Even a tiny bit of Wan Yao Ling Milk could elevate the grade of the pills by one tier.

Once the Wan Yao Ling Milk was collected, the very bottom of the well revealed itself.

That was a completely solidified substance, the most precious treasure within this well.

Wan Yao Ling Paste! Its efficacy was again double that of Wan Yao Ling Milk.

Enduring his fatigue, Yang Kai carefully continued to collect it.

After a long while, he wiped the sweat from his forehead, sitting cross-legged on the ground and exhaling deeply to restore his energy.

The amount of Wan Yao Ling Paste collected was not too much, at least compared to the spirit liquid and spirit milk, only a mere few dozen pounds. But these few dozen pounds were the essence gathered from millions of pills over thousands of years.

At this moment, the well was finally emptied, with all the accumulation of thousands of years now in Yang Kai's possession.

Frowning in contemplation, Yang Kai felt that this was clearly a trap, a trap set over thousands of years.

The portrait of Dan Sheng outside was the biggest bait in this trap. If an alchemist wished to comprehend the way of alchemy from the portrait, they would have to invest pills into the Wan Yao Pool.

And the energy and essence of those invested pills gathered here.

After thousands of years, it had finally resulted in the Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Was this a trap set by the creator of the Wordless Black Book? Yang Kai could not know.

But it was undeniable that this trap was cleverly designed, exploiting the psychology of those alchemists who sought enlightenment, using their willingness to spend wealth for understanding.

As long as the portrait of Dan Sheng remained, as long as the Wan Yao Pool remained, as long as Yao Wang Valley remained, thousands of years later, there would likely be another well of Wan Yao Ling Ye here.

But as time goes by and circumstances change, it is already a miracle that Yao Wang Valley has lasted for thousands of years. Who could say whether it would still exist thousands of years from now?

Just as he was deep in thought, the enclosed space suddenly reacted abnormally.

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly as he hurriedly opened his eyes, only to see that the walls of this small space were flashing with various intricate characters and patterns.

Those characters were ancient and obscure, making them incomprehensible.

The patterns were bizarre, yet Yang Kai immediately recognized that many of them were formations and formation diagrams.

As these characters and patterns glowed in the chamber, for some unknown reason, they began to swim rapidly like fish in water.

Yang Kai remained calm, furrowing his brows as he scrutinized everything, trying to understand what was happening.

Before he could sort out his thoughts, the light in the chamber surged, and countless characters and patterns shot towards Yang Kai.

Silently, these characters and patterns all drilled into his mind. His head spun slightly as they continuously entered, making Yang Kai feel as though his mind was about to explode. The veins on his forehead bulged like writhing earthworms, a terrifying sight that made one’s scalp tingle.

This strange situation persisted for a long time, and when the last ray of light shot into Yang Kai's body, the entire chamber suddenly darkened.

A piercing pain surged in Yang Kai's mind, followed by a warm sensation that alleviated the pain.

Uncontrollably exhaling a breath, Yang Kai realized that it was the Warm Spirit Lotus at work. This situation was similar to his encounter in the white mist of another realm, where his soul had been damaged, triggering the automatic repair of the Warm Spirit Lotus.

Vaguely, Yang Kai felt that there was a wealth of information added to his mind. This information was not like what the Wordless Black Book conveyed; the two were not on the same level at all.

When each page of the Wordless Black Book was unsealed, there would also be information conveyed, but that information was minuscule, and even without cultivating Divine Sense, it could be easily understood.

However, the volume of this information was vast, so vast that Yang Kai did not even know what it was.

Calming his mind, Yang Kai began to carefully comprehend the things in his mind.

Before long, some inexplicable information jumped out.

True Alchemy Formula!

As he slowly explored, Yang Kai was astonished to find that this was actually about alchemy, not a technique or martial skill, but a guide on how to refine pills and how to make good pills.

The introductory section of the True Alchemy Formula gathered the experiences and insights of countless top alchemy masters, with many unique alchemy methods recorded within, making it an invaluable treasure.

Yang Kai himself sought to reach the pinnacle of martial arts and did not wish to be distracted by alchemy, but his junior sister needed these things. If she had this True Alchemy Formula to assist her, she would undoubtedly be able to soar to new heights. With her physique and abilities, refining higher-grade, better-quality pills would be a matter of course.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai smiled slightly and did not rush to leave, instead carefully examining the contents.

However, after less than ten breaths of time spent exploring, he suddenly felt an overwhelming fatigue wash over him. The pain that had just subsided surged back into his mind.

Hissing in a cold breath, as the Warm Spirit Lotus activated to gradually repair the damage to his Divine Sense, he felt much better, but the fatigue lingered.

The power of his Divine Sense had been completely exhausted in that brief moment.

The power of Divine Sense also has its limits, just like the Yuan Qi within a martial artist's body. When the Yuan Qi is depleted, the martial artist cannot fight; when the power of Divine Sense is exhausted, it can no longer be used.

This is also why experts in the Divine Roaming Realm, even after cultivating Divine Sense, generally do not use it lightly.

Recovering Yuan Qi is easy, but restoring the power of Divine Sense is difficult. Any heaven-and-earth treasure or pill related to Divine Sense is worth many times more than ordinary items.

Yang Kai was only at the third layer of the True Yuan Realm, and although he had cultivated Divine Sense, he was not weaker than those in the fourth or fifth layers of the Divine Roaming Realm. However, he was clearly still insufficient to probe into the True Alchemy Formula in his mind.

Frowning, he waited quietly for four or five hours before feeling his Divine Sense power once again fill up.

Even with the help of the Warm Spirit Lotus, it took four or five hours to recover. In the case of an ordinary expert in the Divine Roaming Realm, if their Divine Sense power were exhausted, it would take at least ten days or even half a month to recover.

He needed to find some recovery pills to carry with him, Yang Kai secretly planned.

Refusing to admit defeat, he tried once more. After a dozen breaths, his Divine Sense power was indeed consumed once more.

This time, Yang Kai did not wait for it to recover on its own. Instead, he took some Wan Yao Ling Ye and swallowed it, and his Divine Sense power quickly surged.

In less than half an hour, he was once again full of vitality and energy.
