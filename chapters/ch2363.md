## Chapter 2363 — Unsealing

On the island, Yao Changjun's figure flickered and vanished from sight, reappearing instantly in front of the recoiling Yang Kai, clinging to him like a maggot to the bone, impossible to shake off.

He snorted coldly and reached out to grab Yang Kai. "If you'd cooperated earlier, this old man might have spared your life!"

The implication was clear: even if Yang Kai begged for mercy now, it was too late.

Having been ambushed by Yang Kai once before, Yao Changjun bore a deep grudge, considering it a grave humiliation. There was no way he would let it go so easily.

"Those who go too far are doomed to a bad end. You forced my hand!" Yang Kai gritted his teeth and growled, facing Yao Changjun's grasp without dodging, instead forming a bizarre and ancient hand seal with both hands.

As the seal formed, that terrifying feeling that made Yao Changjun's heart tremble returned in an instant. His face changed dramatically, and without the slightest hesitation, he sped up his movements, clamping down hard on Yang Kai's shoulder blade.

At that moment, Yang Kai's expression suddenly calmed, his eyes turning icy as he spoke each word with chilling clarity: "Firmament Seal, release!"

"Firmament Seal? What nonsense is that?" Yao Changjun looked utterly confused, having no idea what Yang Kai was talking about. But in the next instant, his face contorted in shock, as if struck by lightning. His eyes bulged wide, as if he'd seen a ghost in broad daylight, and with a startled cry, he retreated rapidly.

Boom...

A thunderous explosion rang out as an indescribable aura erupted from Yang Kai's Dantian, filled with an extremely dark and evil energy. It was as if all the world's most savage and vicious malevolence had gathered in one place. Even someone as strong as Yao Changjun couldn't help but lose focus, his whole body trembling.

The pitch-black aura spread out like a tangible substance, instantly enveloping Yang Kai. The energy seemed to possess its own life, constantly flowing over his body, forming one mysterious and profound pattern after another on his skin.

Yang Kai's entire aura soared higher and higher.

Heaven and earth trembled, the universe collapsed, and the world was turned upside down. A destructive might capable of annihilating everything burst forth, shooting out in all directions.

In just a brief moment, Yang Kai vanished from sight. Looking around, only a pitch-black figure remained where he had stood. That darkness seemed able to devour all things, even light could not penetrate it. Only a pair of blood-red eyes remained, filled with a murderous, bloody intent.

"D-D-Demonic Qi!" Yao Changjun's teeth chattered, nearly biting his own tongue. He stared in disbelief at the scene before him. With his experience, he instantly recognized the aura swirling around Yang Kai as Demonic Qi, and not just any Demonic Qi, but the purest Ancient Demonic Qi!

"How is this possible?" Yao Changjun could hardly believe his eyes. In all his years, he had never seen Ancient Demonic Qi, and now it appeared on a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Ancient Demonic Qi possessed extremely corrosive and assimilative properties. Even someone at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, if wrapped in such Demonic Qi, would quickly lose their mind and become a demon.

How could Yang Kai remain clear-headed? How could he store such terrifying Demonic Qi within himself?

Recalling what Yang Kai had said earlier, Yao Changjun suddenly realized that this brat had somehow sealed Demonic Qi inside his body, able to unseal it when facing an enemy.

But now, resealing the Demonic Qi would be far more difficult. Wasn't he afraid of being consumed by it and turning into a demon? No wonder this brat had repeatedly warned him not to push too far—he truly had the strength to fight back, even if it was a bit of a trick. Still, he had the right to boast.

Yao Changjun was filled with regret. If he'd known this earlier, he would never have pressed so hard. Now, with the brat shrouded in Demonic Qi, who knew if he was still sane? The surging demonic power and terrifying pressure left Yao Changjun with no desire to fight.

Studying Yang Kai's eyes carefully, he found that although they were blood-red and murderous, there seemed to be a trace of reason struggling within. Yao Changjun hurriedly said, "Young Brother, wait! This old man has something to say!"

Yang Kai glanced at him indifferently and replied, "You can keep talking, but it’s all foul wind to me."

Yao Changjun was speechless with rage!

If Yang Kai had dared speak to him like this before, he would have slapped him silly. But now, Yang Kai had the strength to back up his words.

Bitterness welled up in his heart as he realized the source of his earlier unease, his expression shifting endlessly.

"The power seems even stronger..." Yang Kai clenched his fists, sensing his current state. Instead of joy, he felt concern, because this time, after unsealing the Firmament Tree's Two-Color Seal and releasing the Ancient Giant Demon's Demonic Qi within, his strength felt much greater than the last time he was demonized.

This wasn't due to his own cultivation improving, but because the Demonic Qi had become more compatible with his body.

Last time, he was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. After demonizing, he fought a battle against three Great Emperors at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm and escaped safely. This time, his demonization was even more intense.

This made Yang Kai faintly uneasy. The stronger his power surged after demonization, the harder it would be to seal it away again. If he ever failed to fully suppress the Demonic Qi, he would truly fall into darkness, losing his mind and becoming a demon, doomed for eternity.

Yao Changjun had no idea Yang Kai was worried about this. Hearing him say his power was stronger, he thought the brat was just showing off and angrily retorted, "Brat, enemies should be resolved, not made. We're both in dire straits—why fight? Wouldn't it be better to find a way out together? Besides, though you're strong now, killing this old man won't be so easy. I'm not made of clay!"

Yang Kai looked at him coldly and snorted, "If you were a true Third Stage Emperor, I really couldn't kill you. But you're a cripple with a wounded Divine Soul, and you dare yap in front of me?"

"C-Cripple?" Yao Changjun's eyes bulged in fury. No one had ever dared speak to him like this.

Yang Kai said, "I don't have much time. I'll take your dog life in three moves!"

"Arrogant! Let's see how you kill me in three moves!" Yao Changjun trembled with anger, feeling utterly underestimated. Pride surged in his heart, and he swore to teach this brat a lesson, to show him that an old dog still has teeth.

That thought had barely formed when Yang Kai's expression suddenly sharpened, and he chanted in a low voice, "Black-Pupil Purgatory, Boundless Darkness!"

As his words fell, the world was plunged into utter darkness. Not a trace of light remained. No matter how Yao Changjun strained his eyes, he couldn't see a thing. It was as if he'd suddenly gone blind. Not only that, but even his keen senses as a Third Stage Emperor were suppressed to the limit.

He couldn't have gone blind for no reason, nor could the world have turned dark without warning. The only explanation was that Yang Kai had unleashed some heaven-defying technique.

Recalling the strange black light in Yang Kai's right eye earlier, Yao Changjun cried out in alarm, "Eye technique!"

As soon as he spoke, cold sweat broke out all over him, for he realized his voice hadn't carried at all. The world around him seemed to have stripped away all sensation—he couldn't speak, couldn't see. It felt like he'd fallen into a bottomless purgatory, endless and terrifying.

Above him, something seemed to loom. Yao Changjun looked up in fright, and when he saw it clearly, his whole body went rigid.

In the boundless black sky, a giant eye hung in the void, utterly emotionless, staring at him with icy indifference.

That eye was like the eye of heaven, its pupil like the pupil of earth. Under its gaze, Yao Changjun suddenly felt utterly insignificant and small. In an instant, his heart sank, and he felt that all his years of bitter cultivation were meaningless—he would end up as nothing but a pile of bones.

As that thought arose, Yao Changjun's entire aura collapsed, a suffocating deathly energy enveloping him.

At that moment, a streak of light shot out from the giant eye—a long blade.

Imperial Treasure, Soul-Severing Blade!

After Yang Kai refined the Soul-Severing Blade, he could wield it freely. Normally, his cultivation wasn't enough to unleash its full power, but now, in his demonized state, his strength was equal to a Third Stage Emperor. The Soul-Severing Blade's strike was terrifyingly powerful.

Moreover, to finish Yao Changjun quickly, Yang Kai also used the secret technique, Heaven-Shattering Strike.

Heaven-Shattering Strike was a Divine Soul secret technique he learned from Tian Yan in the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror. Normally, he could use his Divine Soul to nurture and refine the Soul-Severing Blade, but in battle, its first strike could unleash tremendous explosive power.

However, it was limited to the first strike only.

Imperial Treasure paired with a secret technique—even if Yao Changjun were in perfect condition, he might not withstand it, let alone with his Divine Soul already wounded.

The blade slashed fiercely into Yao Changjun's Sea of Consciousness, tearing open a massive wound with unstoppable force.

Yao Changjun's Sea of Consciousness was already badly damaged, and now, struck by Yang Kai's blow, it was even worse. The Sea of Consciousness of a Third Stage Emperor showed signs of collapse.

Agonizing pain brought Yao Changjun back from despair. He screamed in torment, and a five-colored spear suddenly appeared in his palm, its light shining brilliantly, radiating the energy of an Imperial Treasure—its power was terrifying.

For someone at the Third Stage Emperor Realm, possessing an Imperial Treasure was nothing unusual. If he didn't have one, that would be strange.

As he cried out, he frantically poured Emperor Yuan into the five-colored spear. The spear buzzed, then suddenly trembled in his hand and vanished.

In the next instant, the giant eye spanning the heavens was pierced by the spear, shattering the darkness that had sealed the world.

In his desperate struggle, Yao Changjun erupted with terrifying power, breaking through the Boundless Darkness secret technique. This technique was unique to the Ancient Giant Demon clan, not something Yang Kai had cultivated himself—it could only be used when he was demonized.

The sky was torn open by the five-colored spear, leaving a rift that lingered for a long time.

"Brat, you dare wound me? I'll kill you!" Yao Changjun roared, but with his Sea of Consciousness on the verge of collapse, his whole body trembled uncontrollably, his face twitching, and his Emperor Yuan was extremely unstable.
