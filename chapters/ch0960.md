## Chapter 960 — Conditions

Di Mo was a lingering remnant soul. Yang Kai had once been unsure which era he came from, but as his rank and influence rose and he encountered more secrets, he became certain that Di Mo was at least several thousand years old.

That was because Yang Kai had found him inside the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

And that Inheritance Celestial Cave had connections to the Dragon-Phoenix Palace and the Twin Pavilion.

The legacies of those two great powers had both been severed several thousand years ago.

That was an age that belonged to the Great Demon God!

In other words, Di Mo was a contemporary of the Great Demon God! It was possible he had dealings with the Bone Clan, but his memory was severely damaged—he couldn’t even recall his own name and only vaguely remembered being called Di Mo .

He didn’t know much about the Bone Clan.

“If there’s a Bone Clan, is there a race with a single horn growing from their heads?” Di Mo seemed to recall a few stray clues and asked.

“Do you mean yao?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously; a horned head very likely indicated a yao person.

“No, no! That’s a race—seems to be called the Horn Clan.” Di Mo frowned and thought, but couldn’t remember many details.

After talking for a while longer, Yang Kai let Di Mo rest.

For five consecutive days, Yang Kai and the others stayed within the demon palace.

Changyuan’s hospitality was flawless—every day brought mountain delicacies and sea treasures, all rich specialties unique to the Demon Domain, foods rarely seen on human territory; not only supremely delicious, they could boost cultivation and refine bone and blood.

But Yang Kai had not come to indulge. He had repeatedly broached the secrets left by the Great Demon God, yet Changyuan dismissed the topic lightly, saying there was no rush and inviting him to enjoy the Demon Capital for a few days before discussing it.

Yang Kai understood Changyuan’s thinking: he felt that by himself he could not contend with Meng Wuya and Li Rong, and likely had already sent word to the Four Great Demon Generals to come assist.

It wasn’t necessarily for battle—no one knew what the Great Demon God’s secret truly contained; there might be enormous benefits, and if the secret were unlocked, Changyuan would not be polite—he would surely bring the Four Great Demon Generals to seize whatever advantages there were.

Seeing Changyuan’s concerns, Yang Kai no longer pressed the matter.

A few days later, while wandering the Demon Capital, Yang Kai suddenly shifted expression, looked up at the sky, and appeared thoughtful.

“The four demon generals have arrived!” Meng Wuya chuckled wickedly. “I always knew Changyuan was waiting for them; that fellow is wary—he thinks we have designs on the Great Demon God’s secret.”

“His caution is understandable.” Yang Kai snorted. “Let’s go back; I think he won’t refuse this time.”

Saying so, Yang Kai led the group toward the demon palace.

On the streets, countless demons cast curious glances at Yang Kai.

The demons living in the Demon Capital all knew this human youth was a guest of their Lord, so during these days no sensible demon dared make trouble—only curiosity over why the Lord would show such warm hospitality to a human.

Before the demon palace, as Yang Kai and the others arrived at the square, a demon hurried over and cupped his hands: “Saint Lord, Lord requests your presence!”

Yang Kai and Meng Wuya exchanged a look and smiled knowingly.

“Lead the way!” Yang Kai nodded to the demon with a calm expression.

The demon said nothing and turned to lead them.

Inside a hall, Changyuan and the Four Great Demon Generals sat properly and waited for Yang Kai’s arrival.

Seeing him stride in, Changyuan rose, laughed heartily, and greeted him: “Saint Lord, thank you for enduring the wait—indeed my four subordinates were curious about the Great Demon God’s secret and insisted on seeing it. Come, come, let me introduce you.”

With that, he said to the four: “This here is Yang Kai, the current head of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; I imagine some of you have met him, and even if you haven’t you’ve surely heard his name.”

Yang Kai cast a glance at the four and added, “I am also the Great Demon God’s successor!”

Changyuan’s expression changed. The four generals couldn’t help but show a trace of nervousness and some reverence; even Xueli smiled at Yang Kai in a friendly way, with none of her previous hostility or arrogance.

The weight of being the Great Demon God’s successor was almost equal to the demon lord’s authority, leaving them no room for contempt or disrespect.

Changyuan was stunned for a moment, then laughed: “Indeed, Saint Lord is the one chosen by the Great Demon God—though regrettably of human form! If he were one of my demon kin… hah, I would hand over the demon lord’s position!”

The Demon Domain had been opened by the Great Demon God; naturally his chosen successor should preside over the Demon Domain.

Changyuan’s light remarks nevertheless revealed his apprehension toward Yang Kai, as if he feared Yang Kai might snatch the demon lord’s seat.

Quickly changing the subject, he introduced the four pillars of his Demon Domain: “These four are the supports of my Demon Domain—Xueli and Meng Ge you’ve met already; this is Gou Qiong , and this is Ba He.”

As he spoke, he pointed to the other two men.

Ba He inclined his head slightly to Yang Kai; this demon general was a name Yang Kai had heard of but never personally dealt with.

Yang Kai, however, looked more closely at Gou Qiong.

Gou Qiong ’s face twitched with embarrassment as he cupped his hands: “Saint Lord, it seems there were misunderstandings between us before. Gou Qiong offers his apologies—Saint Lord is magnanimous, please do not hold past matters against me. I should also thank Saint Lord for saving my son’s life; if not for you, my son would have perished in that Small Xuan Realm.”

Yang Kai laughed heartily: “No need for thanks, Lord Gou Qiong—is Gou Chi all right?”

“Thanks to Saint Lord’s concern, my son is well.” Gou Qiong showed surprise; he hadn’t expected Yang Kai to let the matter pass so lightly.

His son Gou Chi had once suffered alongside Yang Kai in a Small Xuan Realm; Yang Kai had ultimately brought him out, and it was in that Small Xuan Realm that Yang Kai obtained the Divine Tree.

But after escaping the Small Xuan Realm, the group was captured by Xueli and taken to Sand City. Later Gou Qiong sent people to ransom Gou Chi, and at the same time sought Yang Kai’s life.

Those various debts and grievances were not for outsiders to discuss.

“What of the Yang Clan? The Small Xuan Realm has opened, and a branch called the Yang Clan lived there—what became of them?” Yang Kai asked.

In the past he had suffered many losses at the hands of the Yang Clan.

“They were all exterminated!” Gou Qiong answered gravely. “The power within their bodies significantly suppressed our demon kin, so they could not be allowed to exist!”

Yang Kai nodded. The Yang Clan’s fate was unsurprising—since that Small Xuan Realm’s gateway lay within the Demon Domain, even if Gou Qiong had not cleared them out, Xueli would not have idly watched.

“Enough idle talk, let’s get to the point!” Changyuan thundered.

Everyone’s expressions grew solemn.

“The reason we invited Saint Lord is the Great Demon God’s secret left behind long ago; I imagine Saint Lord is curious,” Changyuan said with a smile directed at Yang Kai.

“That is why I came.”

Changyuan gave a slight nod and sighed. “To be honest, if it weren’t absolutely necessary, I would be most unwilling to borrow another’s hand. That is a secret left behind by the Demon God, meant as the heritage of my Demon Race. But now, aside from the Demon God’s Secret Codex in Saint Lord Yang’s possession, there is no other way to unlock that secret. I believe this must also be the will of the Demon God.”

The demon generals’ faces were grave as they looked at Yang Kai.

“So I need to confirm something, and I need Saint Lord to give me a guarantee.”

“What guarantee?”

“Whatever that secret is, Saint Lord must not disclose it to outsiders!”

“Agreed!” Yang Kai nodded.

“If there are benefits hidden there, they belong to my demon race—Saint Lord must not covet them. Of course, since you traveled so far to come, I will ensure you receive a satisfactory reward!”

“What does the Demon Lord suppose might be there?” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Who can say? Legend holds the Demon God possessed many divine arts—perhaps the place conceals cultivation methods of his!”

At those words the four generals’ breaths quickened and greed flashed in their eyes.

They were all tempted.

“I think there might be nothing there!” Yang Kai smiled confidently.

“Why say that?” Changyuan asked in surprise, feeling Yang Kai might know something and becoming alert.

“I’m just saying it.” Yang Kai shrugged.

In that strange realm, the Great Demon God’s Soul Incarnation had once said that if he ever had the chance to visit the Demon Capital, all mysteries would be revealed.

So Yang Kai determined the secret was not some hidden divine art or treasure, merely a secret.

The benefits left by the Great Demon God were contained within the Demon God’s Secret Codex, and Yang Kai had already acquired those.

Seeing Yang Kai unwilling to elaborate, Changyuan frowned and asked helplessly, “So, Saint Lord, do you agree to my proposal or not?”

“It doesn’t matter—do as you wish.” Yang Kai shrugged.

Changyuan was taken aback by his ready compliance and felt a sour foreboding, as if the Great Demon God’s secret truly held no advantage; his spirits sank noticeably.

But he would not despair until the end; he rallied himself and said, “Very well. Of course, if Saint Lord trusts me, I hope you will enter that place alone!”

“Impossible!” Meng Wuya shook his head decisively, sneering at Changyuan. “You and your four generals are present—asking him to go alone is sending a lamb into a tiger’s den. In any case, we will accompany him; I do not trust you.”

He had suffered greatly under the Demon Lord in the past; the lesson had been bitter.

Changyuan looked at Meng Wuya, helpless, and seeing his resolve, pondered for a while before nodding: “Fine, then we shall all go in together! But my condition stands—whatever you see there, do not reveal it, or else…”

“Or else what?” Meng Wuya taunted Changyuan.

“Nothing more to say—I cherish the friendship with Saint Lord and do not wish anyone ill!” Changyuan smiled faintly, said no more, and motioned, “Please follow me.”

The four demon generals followed with high spirits; they were extremely curious about the Great Demon God’s secret, having only heard tales and never set foot in that place—this opportunity to see it with their own eyes was thanks to Yang Kai.
