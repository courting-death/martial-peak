## Chapter 1428 — Unreasonable

"This is also territory of your Lingxiao Sect?" someone exclaimed, eyes bulging.

"Indeed. From this Layer's flame barrier outward for a hundred li, all of it belongs to my Lingxiao Sect," Yang Kai said solemnly. "And whoever sets foot without permission will be regarded as challenging and infringing upon my Lingxiao Sect!"

At these words, everyone frowned heavily.

Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain slammed her dragon-head staff into the ground and snorted coldly, "Young man, do you take the heroes of the world so lightly? How dare you speak with such shameless arrogance!"

“I’m the one speaking arrogantly?” Yang Kai tilted his head toward her with a faint smile. “Then may I ask, Elder Feng—within how many li of your Myriad Beasts Mountain is outsiders’ presence forbidden? A hundred li? A thousand? Or perhaps even more?”

Old Woman Feng's face darkened and she was momentarily at a loss for words.

"What about the Battle Sky Alliance?" Yang Kai turned to Mo Xiaosheng. Mo Xiaosheng's face went sullen and he remained silent.

"And the Leitai Sect?" Yang Kai glanced at Cheng Pengxuan, who snorted coldly and fell silent.

Yang Kai laughed heartily. "You Elders are people of great renown — don't play coy before a junior. Even Second- and Third-Tier forces maintain a hundred-li forbidden zone around their sect; as far as I know, First-Tier sects' forbidden areas extend a thousand li or more! I ask for no more than this: a hundred li must be claimed. Or are you Elders thinking me too young and dare to insult my newly founded Lingxiao Sect, not placing it in your eyes?"

Toward the end his voice grew colder and his expression turned severe.

"Sect Master Yang, one shouldn't speak like that, right?" a sweet, delicate voice suddenly rang out, clear and pleasant, instantly capturing everyone's attention.

Yang Kai turned and saw the picturesque young woman beside Old Woman Feng smiling at him.

Yang Kai didn't know who this girl was, but since she stood with Old Woman Feng, she must be a disciple of Myriad Beasts Mountain.

"What counsel does this young lady offer?" Yang Kai asked her coolly.

The girl stepped forward with grace. Her manners were impeccable, and paired with her pleasing looks and sweet smile, she provoked no dislike.

Her red lips parted and she sweetly said, "Letting Sect Master Yang know, little sister is Feng Yan, a disciple of Myriad Beasts Mountain."

"Feng Yan." Yang Kai frowned and glanced at Old Woman Feng. They shared a surname, and the woman's cultivation was not high — only Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, like his — yet Feng Yan was kept by Old Woman Feng and clearly favored. No wonder she dared speak out in such a setting without fear of punishment.

"I mean no offense, little sister only wishes to tell Sect Master Yang that this Flowing Flame Sandland was originally a forbidden area of Dark Star, a no-man's land — a shared treasure for all cultivators of our Dark Star. Each time the Flowing Flame Sandland opens, many obtain benefits and opportunities. Now Sect Master Yang rashly occupies this place and intends to mark out a hundred-li forbidden zone. Is that not improper?" Feng Yan's words were nimble and she quickly hit the heart of the matter, drawing approving nods from many strong ones. They looked to her expectantly, but Feng Yan remained unshaken, clearly experienced in big scenes. She smiled lightly and continued, "If calculated, each force on Dark Star has a share in this Flowing Flame Sandland. Sect Master Yang has forcibly taken what belongs to everyone. Were Myriad Beasts Mountain to seize something from Sect Master Yang, I doubt Sect Master Yang would be pleased. By the same logic, your occupation of the Flowing Flame Sandland should be discussed with the Elders present."

"Exactly!" Mo Xiaosheng quickly chimed in, nodding in agreement. "The Flowing Flame Sandland is one of Dark Star's three great forbidden areas, a common treasure for all our cultivators — no one may monopolize it!"

"A common treasure?" Yang Kai scoffed and curled his lips. "That's history. This Flowing Flame Sandland is now my Lingxiao Sect's territory! If anyone objects, come and take it by force! If someone truly has the ability to seize it, I'll gladly hand it over with both hands!"

Feng Yan's brows drew together in displeasure. She coolly warned, "Why be so aggressive? Doing this would offend the masses — have you considered the consequences, Sect Master Yang?"

Yang Kai sneered. "Dragon Lair Mountain did nothing to provoke the masses either, yet many swarmed us; if fortune hadn't favored me, I might have been buried on that little mountain. So what if one offends the masses? Little girl, don't play word games or spread alarm. You have no right to converse with this Sect Master. Let your Elders speak."

"You…" Feng Yan bit her lip, full of resentment. "Aren't you being unreasonable?"

“Heh, unreasonable?” Yang Kai looked at her with open mockery. “Don’t you know? In this world, whoever has the bigger fist is the one who’s right.” Feng Yan trembled with anger, her face flushing red, yet she didn’t dare utter a single harsh word.

Without giving anyone else a chance to speak, Yang Kai snorted coldly, his eyes sweeping over everyone as he said in a clear voice, “I, Yang, have said all that should be said. If you still refuse to see reason, then as Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect, I won’t mind paying a visit to your headquarters when I have the time. Courtesy goes both ways—since you ignored my warning and entered my Sect’s territory without permission, I won’t be polite either. If your Sects suffer any losses by then, don’t blame me for not giving prior notice.”

The stark warning left everyone looking displeased.

Yang Kai surveyed them and was pleased with their reactions; as long as they still feared him, they wouldn't court trouble. After all, in the earlier Dragon Lair Mountain battle his side had displayed astonishing power, especially that Void King-Grade warship. No sect master would dare disregard it — the crystal cannons' combined fire could likely break through any protective array.

His gaze froze on someone in the crowd and he grinned, calling out, "Miss Daiyuan!"

Among the crowd, a group from Liuli Sect was present, led by Gong Aofu. Daiyuan and Yin Sudie followed close, along with other Liuli Sect disciples.

Yang Kai had not seen them before.

Hearing his call, Daiyuan smiled faintly and nodded slightly.

"Miss Daiyuan, would you like to come in for a look? It will make future visits more convenient," Yang Kai warmly invited.

In an instant all eyes turned to Daiyuan; countless gazes fell upon her, each face expressing astonishment and peculiar looks.

If Daiyuan were beautiful, Yang Kai's invitation would be understandable — after all, who in youth lacks gallantry?

But in fact Daiyuan was not beautiful; she was hideously ugly, her face pitted and sallow, appearing malnourished. Even a good figure could not mask her innate lack of attractiveness.

A woman like that would rarely find anyone willing to associate with her.

Yet Yang Kai, who had spoken plainly to someone like Feng Yan, had actively invited Daiyuan into Lingxiao Sect and insisted it would make future contact easier.

What was going on?

Could the young man have peculiar tastes, preferring ugliness over beauty? At the absurd thought everyone slowly shook their heads; it seemed unlikely.

Facing so many pairs of eyes, Daiyuan seemed uneasy; there were too many powerful onlookers here, and she didn't know how to respond.

Gong Aofu's eyes gleamed strangely, her red lips moving as she transmitted a whispered message to Daiyuan: "Yuan'er, since he invited you, go in and have a look. See what Lingxiao Sect is like. If possible, ask him whether when the Imperial Garden opens he could let Liuli Sect members enter the Imperial Garden from within the Flowing Flame Sandland."

Daiyuan’s brows furrowed slightly. Though she instinctively resisted, her Master’s order could not be disobeyed, so she steeled herself and said, “To be invited by Junior Brother Yang is Daiyuan’s honor; Daiyuan will respectfully accept."

"Very well." Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"Yang Kai!" Before he finished, Yin Sudie suddenly called out coquettishly, her water-bright eyes radiating temptation. She had cultivated the Charm Technique and had risen to the Origin Returning Realm; her charm had greatly improved, and together with her pleasing looks she was irresistible. Even Saint King Realm men could not resist her allure; many stared with wide eyes.

"I want to come in and have a look too, can I?" Yin Sudie asked in a flirtatious, syrupy voice — as if a delicate hand were stroking one's heart, making one feel pleasant to the bone.

“Are we that familiar?” Yang Kai’s blunt reply instantly ruined the mood—he clearly had no intention of humoring her, rejecting her outright in one sentence.

Yin Sudie's pretty face flushed and paled, her eyes losing their charm and filling with endless resentment.

Yang Kai paid her no mind and scanned the crowd again, then fixed his gaze elsewhere and cupped his fist slightly, addressing another Elder: "This Elder…"

On that side, a middle-aged man in a scholar's robe with long hair and a wild air raised an eyebrow, showing pleasure and laughing heartily: "Since Sect Master Yang invites, I won't refuse!"

Yang Kai touched his nose, thinking to himself that he hadn't finished speaking before the other had already accepted — apparently he had been waiting for such an invitation.

No matter; he had intended to invite him anyway.

The man seemed to be called Mo Yu. Yang Kai didn't know his background well, just that he bore no ill will and belonged to Qiantian Sect. During the Dragon Lair Mountain clash the man had once acted and had helped Yang Kai negate some attacks, whether intentionally or not.
