## Chapter 2071 — The Stray Dog

Three peak Tenth-Tier demonic beasts were formidable, yet the Jiang Family also possessed many Void King Realm experts, including those at the Third Stage; thus when the fight broke out, the two sides were actually evenly matched.

However, after hearing Mo Xiaoqi's words, every member of the Jiang Family felt their hearts drop; they glanced at one another across the distance, some rendered speechless, tears welling in their eyes...

Those three demonic beasts alone had already bound the Jiang Family—if Xiao Bai, Xiao Huang, Xiao Qing, Xiao Lu and the others had also made a grand entrance, the Jiang Family would have had no strength left to retaliate.

At that moment, Jiang Lin suddenly remembered something; while dodging the fierce assaults of Red-Fire Qilin, he stared at the little cloth pouch at Mo Xiaoqi's waist in astonishment and cried out, "Spirit-beast pouch! Young lady, are you from Spirit Beast Island?"

Only now did he finally recall the origin of those little cloth pouches.

Though each of those little pouches looked utterly unremarkable, they were unique products of Spirit Beast Island! Only Spirit Beast Island's experts could, by secret methods, craft such devices capable of containing demonic beasts.

Moreover, spirit-beast pouches were never sold to outsiders; it was impossible for others to obtain one. Yet Mo Xiaoqi had a whole mess of them hanging about her waist—if she had no connection to Spirit Beast Island, how could she possibly have so many?

Spirit Beast Island was a famed force throughout the Star Realm: though not as vast as Star God Palace or Soul Palace, nor boasting as many disciples, it was nonetheless a transcendent power in its own right.

The reason was simple: the island's owner, or rather its Island Lord, was one of the ten elusive Emperors—Beast Great Emperor!

Rumor had it that Spirit Beast Island housed countless demonic beasts rarely seen in the outside world. Even Ancient Divine Spirits had settled there; the island's birds and beasts were innumerable.

Thus, even though Spirit Beast Island was but a single island, and the Beast Great Emperor had never thrown open its gates to recruit disciples, its deterrent might within the Star Realm was in no way inferior to that of Soul Palace or Star God Palace, both of which likewise had one of the ten Great Emperors presiding over them.

However, Spirit Beast Island lay in the boundless sea of the far Eastern Territory, a distance of billions of li from the Southern Territory. At first, Jiang Lin had not associated Mo Xiaoqi's identity with Spirit Beast Island.

But as a head of his family, seeing the many wondrous means Mo Xiaoqi had displayed, how could he not begin to suspect?

"Young lady, what relation does Beast Great Emperor have with you?" Jiang Lin hurriedly asked, seizing the moment while Mo Xiaoqi said nothing.

After all, as far as he knew, Spirit Beast Island did not broadly accept disciples. Those allowed to live on Spirit Beast Island were people who had some connection to Beast Great Emperor; if Mo Xiaoqi truly hailed from Spirit Beast Island, then she must be either Beast Great Emperor's relative or one of the few disciples!

Such an existence—how could the Jiang Family provoke it? They might as well treat her as a Guest Elder.

Mo Xiaoqi merely stood within the water curtain formed by the Weak Water Pearl, cradling a little bat in one arm while stroking it with the other; at the remark she looked up at the sky, indifferent and dismissive.

The other Jiang Family members' faces changed dramatically at Jiang Lin's words; each felt a chill shoot to the crown of the head, leaving them no mind to deal with the demonic beasts' attacks.

With that, the balance of power was instantly broken.

First, an elder of the Jiang Family failed to notice a fireball from Red-Fire Qilin and was melted on the spot with a scream; then a deacon of the Jiang Family was slapped by the Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger Beast into a meat-pancake, blood spraying everywhere—his death a ghastly sight.

From the black cloud conjured by the Blue-Eyed Ink-Scaled Jiao another figure shot out.

It had already lost its breath before landing; as it hit the ground, its head slumped to one side.

In an instant, three of the Jiang Family's Void King Realm experts met untimely deaths!

Seeing this, Jiang Lin's eyes reddened; he swept away his fear and worry, and cried out fiercely, "Young lady, whatever ties you have with Beast Great Emperor, now that blood has been shed, it is either you die or we perish!"

At his words the other Jiang Family members' expressions all convulsed.

Everyone knew there was no option but to fight desperately; not only had a blood feud been sealed, but Mo Xiaoqi's background was not something they could provoke. If they couldn't cut Mo Xiaoqi down today, the Jiang Family would have no foothold left in the Star Realm.

Mo Xiaoqi did not even need to act personally—if she merely let word leak out, countless experts would scramble to bring the Jiang Family members' heads to her!

Opportunities to curry favor with Spirit Beast Island were rare indeed!

With emotions steadied, the Jiang Family rallied and somehow turned the disadvantage back in their favor.

But at that moment, it seemed the outcome of the Dao Origin Realm showdown over there had already been decided.

With a terrible cry, the two figures of Jiang Taisheng and Yang Kai—entangled in midair—split apart.

Yang Kai looked unconcerned, while Jiang Taisheng standing not far in front of him was pale and blood edged the corner of his mouth—he had clearly suffered serious injury!

This century-old Dao Origin Realm expert had, within less than the time it took to drink half a cup of tea, already been driven to a crushing disadvantage by Yang Kai.

He looked at Yang Kai with venomous disbelief, unable to accept that he was no match for this youth.

When he turned his gaze back to those below, Jiang Taisheng's face immediately darkened!

With his vision he could plainly see that his family's descendants had run into trouble and could not be relied upon.

Perhaps the Jiang Family's centuries-old foundation would be buried here today!

At that thought, Jiang Taisheng's countenance dimmed; in anger he glared at Yang Kai and cried, "Young one, even if I die today, I'll drag you down with me!"

Saying so, he urged the force within him; his once-pale old face flushed considerably, and at the same time he bit his tongue to draw blood, spitting out a mouthful of Essence-Blood!

Yang Kai's face darkened; he realized the old man truly intended to fight to the death.

Confident as he was that he could kill Jiang Taisheng, Yang Kai still knew the other was, at the very least, a Dao Origin Realm master—one who, if he truly fought to the death, could not be underestimated. Besides, Yang Kai was holding Zhang Ruoxi in his arms, his movements constrained, so he prudently adopted a defensive stance, wary that the old fox might unleash some desperate, all-or-nothing gambit.

The next instant a mist of blood enveloped Jiang Taisheng, hiding him from view.

Then that blood-mist shimmered and vanished on the spot, transforming into a streak of light that fled rapidly in the opposite direction from Yang Kai!

"This..." Yang Kai gaped in astonishment and stood frozen for a moment.

He had never imagined that Jiang Taisheng’s battle cries—so loud, so resolute, as though he truly meant to fight Yang Kai to the death—would in the end be nothing but a cover for his escape.

"Old fox!" Yang Kai spat angrily, full of contempt, while hastily stirring his Spatial Force to manipulate the Law of Space; he pointed distantly at the streak of blood-light and shouted, "Bind!"

The blood-light faltered slightly but only for an instant before breaking through the sealing of the Law Power and fled even faster.

After all, Jiang Taisheng was also a Dao Origin Realm expert; Yang Kai was exerting Spatial Law from such a distance—how could it hold him?

Freed from the Law's restraint, Jiang Taisheng turned and plunged toward the cave in the barren mountain, soon vanishing from sight.

"That old thing!" Yang Kai instantly saw through Jiang Taisheng's intention: wounded and unable to outrun him outright, Jiang Taisheng would not flee simply by speed; if that were the plan he would not escape Yang Kai's pursuit.

Yang Kai, who understood Spatial Force, had absolute advantages in tracking and pursuit.

So Jiang Taisheng had set his mind on the Space Array in that cave: if he could transmit himself via the array, no matter how great Yang Kai's power, he could not be caught.

Jiang Taisheng's scheme was clever, and it succeeded; not two breaths after entering the cave, his aura suddenly vanished and was replaced by a faint fluctuation of Spatial Force.

That fluctuation, of course, was due to Jiang Taisheng's use of the cave's Space Array.

On the other side, the Jiang Family's people saw this and felt their hearts sink.

They had fought and bled, even losing three men, all in order to help their old ancestor.

They never expected that at the crucial moment their old ancestor would, without hesitation, abandon them and flee without so much as bidding them farewell.

They had never had much hope of defeating Mo Xiaoqi, and with Yang Kai, a Dao Origin Realm expert, freed from engagement, if the Jiang Family stayed it would be courting death.

So Jiang Lin decisively shouted, "Retreat!"

Everyone rapidly withdrew from the battle ring and raced crazily toward the barren mountain cave!

They planned the same as Jiang Taisheng: since they could not escape Yang Kai, they would rely on the Space Array; if they could be transmitted away, they might survive.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai showed no sign of stopping them; he stood calmly in midair and watched them flee.

But the playful smile at the corner of his mouth made Jiang Lin wary.

The other Jiang Family members rejoiced and rushed into the cave in a mad scramble, packing the small cave full.

One by one Source Crystals were hastily placed into the array's surrounding slots by a Jiang Family elder; when everything seemed ready he immediately channeled power to activate the array.

Yet...

There was no response!

With the Jiang Family standing there on tenterhooks, their hearts scorched with anxiety, the Space Array that should have sprung to life at any moment lay as inert as a dead thing, not uttering so much as a whisper—let alone transporting them away.

"What's happening?" Jiang Chuhe cried in alarm.

"The array...it isn't responding!" the elder said, his face pale.

"How can there be no response? Let me try!" Jiang Chuhe said, stepping forward to push his force into the array as the elder had.

But the result was the same—the Space Array appeared to have lost its efficacy and would not operate.

A figure suddenly appeared at the cave mouth, emitting a strange chuckle as he stepped slowly inside.
