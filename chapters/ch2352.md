## Chapter 2352 — Never Tasted Death

Yang Kai found a spot on the third floor, ordered a pot of fine spirit tea, and sat quietly, listening to the lively discussions around him.

The cultivators who came here for tea varied greatly in strength, but the information they inadvertently revealed in their idle chatter was exactly what Yang Kai needed.

He sat in the tea house for most of the day, as groups of patrons came and went, but Yang Kai remained motionless the entire time.

He managed to pick up quite a bit of useful information.

Unfortunately, no one mentioned the Netherworld Sect, which disappointed him. He suspected he would have to enter the Eastern Territory to learn about them.

Just as Yang Kai was about to get up and leave, a surge of powerful energy suddenly erupted from not far down the street, as if someone had started a fight.

Yang Kai was already used to this. Gao City’s law and order was chaotic, and brawls broke out all the time. As long as trouble didn’t come looking for him, he didn’t care.

The energy fluctuation came and went quickly. The difference in strength between the two sides seemed significant. Immediately after, a graceful figure was sent flying out of a pharmacy across the street. She spat out a mouthful of blood in midair and crashed heavily to the ground, not getting up for a long while—clearly badly injured.

A bald brute burst out of the pharmacy right after, snarling, “Bitch, you dare cause trouble in my Jubao Tower? This is just a warning. Next time, I’ll take your life. Get lost!”

After shouting, the brute glanced disdainfully at the woman lying on the ground, then swaggered back into the shop.

The passing cultivators on the street seemed used to such scenes. No one pitied the injured woman; they just thought she was unlucky to have caused trouble at Jubao Tower—she clearly didn’t know what it meant to court death.

Yang Kai hadn’t planned to meddle. But when he glanced over and saw the woman’s face, his expression changed in surprise. “Qianyun?”

The woman was actually Liu Qianyun!

The same Liu Qianyun who, like Yin Lesheng, came from the Great Wilderness Star Domain.

Back then, he and Liu Qianyun had been forced to join Biyu Sect together, sharing hardship. Later, Wu Mengchuan broke free and left a trail of slaughter; his temperament was cruel and violent. Fearing he would implicate Liu Qianyun, Yang Kai parted ways with her after escaping Biyu Sect.

Years had passed, and he hadn’t expected to meet her again here on the border of the Southern Territory.

Judging by her appearance, Liu Qianyun’s situation wasn’t good. She was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, her aura unstable—clearly she’d just advanced, like Chi Yue and the others. Her Origin Qi hadn’t fully transformed, and after being injured by the bald brute, she looked miserable. Her white clothes were stained red with blood, especially at her chest.

During their days in Biyu Sect, he and Liu Qianyun had supported each other and formed a friendship. Now, seeing her bullied, Yang Kai naturally couldn’t just stand by.

With a thought, Yang Kai leapt down from the third floor, landing lightly beside Liu Qianyun and reaching out to help her up.

Sensing someone approaching, Liu Qianyun’s expression changed. She instinctively lashed out with a palm at Yang Kai.

“Qianyun, it’s me!” Yang Kai called out in a deep voice.

Liu Qianyun’s hand froze in midair, her delicate body trembling. She stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, and when she saw his face, her beautiful eyes lit up with surprise and joy. She cried out, “Senior Brother Yang?”

The two of them had joined Biyu Sect together, even if it was by force. So they were indeed Senior Brother and Junior Sister.

Yang Kai gave her a slight smile. “Life is full of unexpected reunions.”

“Senior Brother Yang, you’re here too?” Upon seeing Yang Kai, Liu Qianyun seemed to forget she’d just been bullied. Her whole demeanor brightened, her face radiant with genuine happiness.

Back in Biyu Sect, Yang Kai had always looked after her, even sharing with her the Source Crystals he earned by refining Spiritual Pills for others. Sadly, after they parted, she never met anyone who treated her so well again.

For Liu Qianyun, her best days in the Star Realm were undoubtedly those spent in Biyu Sect.

“Just passing by. We can catch up later. What happened to you?” Yang Kai asked.

Liu Qianyun’s beautiful eyes flickered. She forced a smile. “It’s nothing, Senior Brother. Let’s find somewhere to sit and talk.”

Yang Kai said calmly, “You’ve been beaten like this—how can it be nothing?”

“It really is nothing, just a small misunderstanding. Senior Brother, you don’t need to worry.” Liu Qianyun insisted. She was clearly afraid of dragging Yang Kai into her troubles and wanted to keep things quiet.

She’d been in Gao City for a while and knew how chaotic it was, and who backed Jubao Tower. When they parted, he had only reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. No matter how talented he was, he couldn’t have advanced too quickly. At best, he’d only be at her level then. Causing trouble here was courting death.

As she spoke, she grabbed Yang Kai’s arm, trying to lead him away from this place of trouble.

Yang Kai stood his ground. “If you still remember me as your Senior Brother, tell me what happened. A mere Jubao Tower isn’t worth worrying about.”

He wasn’t just boasting. While drinking tea earlier, he’d learned that Gao City had only one Emperor Realm master—the City Lord, and he was just at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm. Such a cultivator was nothing to fear.

No matter who backed Jubao Tower, they couldn’t be stronger than the City Lord.

With his current strength, he could definitely fight a First Stage Emperor. Not to mention he had Liu Yan and Xiao Bai with him. If Xiao Bai went all out, he could match a First Stage Emperor.

As long as the City Lord didn’t provoke him, Yang Kai wouldn’t cause trouble. But if he was provoked, he wouldn’t mind turning the city upside down.

Liu Qianyun stared at Yang Kai in shock, not knowing where his confidence came from. Only now did she try to probe his cultivation, but when her Divine Sense swept over him, she was horrified to find his aura completely indistinct. In other words, with her strength, she couldn’t sense his depth at all.

Liu Qianyun was completely stunned.

When they parted, their cultivations had been about the same. But after just a few years, she couldn’t even gauge Yang Kai’s strength. The gap between them was now enormous.

“Don’t worry, I won’t act recklessly. But I have to get justice for you.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Liu Qianyun bit her red lips, knowing she couldn’t dissuade Yang Kai. Moved, she said softly, “I came here to sell something, but Jubao Tower offered too low a price. I didn’t want to sell, but they forced me. When I refused, they wouldn’t return my item. When I argued, they beat me.”

“Robbery and bullying! Outrageous!” Yang Kai’s face darkened. “What were you selling?”

“I’m not sure. It’s a spiritual medicine I found by chance.” Liu Qianyun looked embarrassed. She didn’t even know what she was selling, just that Jubao Tower’s price was too low. She refused to sell, but they wouldn’t return her item. When she argued, they struck her.

“What price did they offer?”

“Ten thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals,” Liu Qianyun said softly.

Yang Kai nodded. “Come with me.”

With that, he led Liu Qianyun toward Jubao Tower.

As soon as they entered, the busy attendant at the counter greeted them with a smile. But when he saw Liu Qianyun with Yang Kai, his smile vanished, replaced by a cold glare. “You bitch, why are you back?”

The attendant was only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, but he showed no fear toward Liu Qianyun, a First Stage Dao Origin Realm, and even cursed at her. Clearly, he relied on his background and didn’t take her seriously at all.

After cursing, he sneered at Yang Kai. “Brought your lover, huh? Looks like you two have never tasted death.”

“Pa…”

A crisp slap rang out. Before the attendant finished speaking, Yang Kai swung his hand. The difference in strength was so great that the attendant couldn’t dodge. He didn't even see it coming before his cheek exploded in pain and he was sent flying.

While still in midair, a series of slaps followed as Yang Kai struck him again and again.

This attendant was clearly a bully who looked down on others. With his foul mouth, Yang Kai had no reason to show mercy.

After more than a dozen slaps, even though Yang Kai hadn’t used much force, the attendant was left dizzy. When he hit the ground, he spat out a mouthful of blood—every tooth in his mouth knocked out.

As soon as Yang Kai acted, the cultivators on the street outside Jubao Tower stared in shock, peering inside. They wondered who this fool was, daring to attack someone in Jubao Tower. He probably wouldn’t live to see tomorrow’s sun.

Watching a commotion was human nature, so a crowd quickly gathered at the door, all craning their necks to see what would happen to Yang Kai next.

Liu Qianyun was stunned. Although Yang Kai had said he didn’t care about Jubao Tower, and she knew he was strong, she hadn’t expected him to start a fight the moment they entered.

If she’d known, she never would have let Yang Kai come in.

Now things had gotten out of hand. Even though Yang Kai had only beaten a lowly attendant, that man was still the face of Jubao Tower. To slap him in public was to slap Jubao Tower itself.

How could Jubao Tower let this go?

For a moment, Liu Qianyun was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan. She felt she’d dragged Yang Kai into trouble and was wracked with guilt, just wanting to get him out of there as quickly as possible.

Sensing her anxiety, Yang Kai squeezed her hand and gave her a gentle smile. “Don’t worry, Senior Brother can handle this.”

Liu Qianyun stared blankly at his bright, confident smile. For some reason, her heart suddenly calmed…
