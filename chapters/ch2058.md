## Chapter 2058 — It Was Actually Him

On the desolate mountain, a howl echoed across the wilderness.

Everyone who heard that sound felt a surge of joy and excitement.

The middle-aged man of the Qin Family stood there, his face blank with stupefaction; he was stunned for a long while before he managed with difficulty to say, "He actually succeeded?"

He could hardly believe his own eyes.

After all, the commotion caused by the advancement had been enormous—far too great for a Third Stage Void King Realm warrior to withstand—but the man had truly succeeded, breaking through to the Dao Origin Realm.

The shock that struck the middle-aged man was fiercer than the turmoil he had felt when he himself had suddenly stepped into the Dao Origin Realm.

Beside him, Qin Yu was equally stunned; although she had vaguely sensed the ascender wouldn't easily fail, when the ascension proceeded so smoothly she still found it hard to accept. Her beautiful eyes narrowed slightly as if trying to pierce the barrier of space and see the face of the ascender.

Far off, Yang Kai quickly suppressed the joy of his ascension and continued to accept the baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy.

The baptism that accompanied a breakthrough to a Realm was exceedingly rare; it could not only cleanse a warrior’s flesh and soul and elevate them further, but within that energy lay the tonal resonance of the Martial Dao—if a warrior could comprehend even a fragment, they would benefit for life.

Moreover, this time Yang Kai had broken through to the Dao Origin Realm, and he could even glimpse the Power of the Laws contained in the baptism.

The law Yang Kai sought to comprehend was, naturally, the Law of Space.

He had already grasped parts of it; what he needed now was to make his understanding of this Power of the Laws yet more thorough.

As the howl subsided, Heaven-and-Earth Energy continued to pour down wildly. Yang Kai remained seated where he was, his expression as calm as still water.

Unimaginable heavenly might poured into his body, on one hand stabilizing the foundation of his Dao Origin Realm and on the other tempering his flesh and the Origin Qi within. With the aid of the wondrous hints carried by that energy, Yang Kai soon immersed himself in understanding the Law of Space.

Time passed slowly…

That black funnel in the sky finally dissolved and vanished after half a day, and the previously heavy, overcast sky returned to clarity.

Even so, the many warriors watching from afar still could not make out Yang Kai’s face, for centered on where he had been standing, space had been twisted to an extreme for several thousand zhang, as if disturbed by some force.

Those warriors assumed this was merely an aftereffect of the earlier loud commotion; one by one they gaped in astonishment.

But upon sensing there was no spectacle to see and no profit to be gained, they all dispersed.

The Qin Family group, however, remained and continued to watch from a distance.

Over ten more days passed. Yang Kai, who had been sitting cross-legged all that time, suddenly opened his eyes. Lightning flickered across his gaze as though he had made a substantial gain.

His eyes cleared and he swept his hand.

The chaotic space within those several thousand zhang was, beneath that single sweep, abruptly smoothed; no further anomalies remained.

Seeing this, Yang Kai grinned.

At the same moment, Qin Yu, who had been watching from afar, suddenly grew solemn; in an instant her eyes closed and opened, and they had turned purple, violet ripples swirling within as if she had deployed some secret art.

Those purple eyes lent the delicate young woman an added air of seductive charm.

She concentrated and looked toward the distance; two purple beams faintly shot out from her eyes and pierced the void.

In the distance, Yang Kai seemed to have perceived something; he turned his head toward the direction of Qin Yu, and the World-Ending Demon Eye suddenly manifested in his left eye, the golden vertical pupil erupting with endless majesty.

Their gazes met in midair; Yang Kai could not help but emit a small "huh" as he instantly dispersed his World-Ending Demon Eye and his expression became serene.

Qin Yu let out a startled cry and involuntarily staggered back several steps, her face growing pale.

"Miss!" the Qin Family’s middle-aged man cried in alarm, flashing to Qin Yu’s side and supporting her, asking with concern, "Miss, what’s wrong with you?"

He had not noticed Qin Yu’s earlier small movement, assuming her old ailment had flared up again.

A thin film of cold sweat had broken out on Qin Yu’s forehead; her purple eyes slowly faded, and when he spoke she shook her head and said, "It’s nothing."

She continued to stare toward where Yang Kai had been, and was astonished to find the place already empty.

Yang Kai had vanished at some unknown moment.

"It was him?" Qin Yu murmured; evidently, after she had used her secret art just now she had seen Yang Kai’s face.

She instantly recalled that she and that man had met on the first layer of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, and that she had even told him how to find the entrance to the second layer.

"Who?" the middle-aged man asked in surprise.

Qin Yu pursed her lips with a smile and shook her head, "It’s nothing."

After a moment she added, "Let’s go back."

The middle-aged man frowned, vaguely sensing his lady’s behavior was odd but not daring to press further; he could only escort Qin Yu with the others toward Fenglin City.

A hundred li from the ascension site, Yang Kai’s figure blurred and then materialized.

He stood there for a brief moment, quietly waiting. The Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal, his two Blood Beasts, came racing up from behind. Yang Kai gave them a glance, stowed them away, then fixed his direction. Without so much as taking a step, his figure vanished from the spot.

Only a faint ripple of spatial power remained where he had been.

Two days later, Yang Kai returned to Primordial Cauldron Mountain.

By now Primordial Cauldron Mountain had become a wasteland: peaks had collapsed, the land was jagged, and there were signs people had turned the place over.

This was probably the work of the Blazing Fire Hall’s people. Yang Kai paid them no mind; he hovered in the heights and silently probed with his Divine Sense.

He could sense that, many zhang beneath the ground, Liu Yan remained in a peculiar slumber, seemingly drawing on the searing power stored in the underground magma pool.

Compared to before, Liu Yan’s aura was undoubtedly much stronger now, faintly showing signs of an imminent breakthrough to the Dao Origin Realm.

Sensing this, Yang Kai was pleased; he immediately withdrew his Divine Sense so as not to disturb Liu Yan.

After looking about, Yang Kai found a secluded spot nearby and sat cross-legged.

He intended to wait there for Liu Yan; after all she had been in the magma pool a long time and might return at any moment.

After some thought he produced the Xuan Realm Pearl, and with a flash entered the Small Xuan Realm.

The instant he stepped into the Small Xuan Realm he felt something different.

That difference was not due to the Small Xuan Realm itself changing, but rather to his own transformation.

Previously his strength had been insufficient to touch the Power of the Laws and he had been unable to perceive it; but now, having ascended to the Dao Origin Realm and able to command the heavenly laws, Yang Kai immediately noticed that the Power of the Laws inside the Small Xuan Realm was imperfect—something seemed to be missing.

He pondered for a long time but drew no conclusions, and gave up.

In a flash he arrived beside his Incarnation.

Since arriving in Fenglin City and teaching the Incarnation the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, Yang Kai had not paid much attention to it.

Now that he looked, Yang Kai could not help but be greatly surprised.

The once enormous being had shrunk by dozens of times; around where the Incarnation stood lay discarded rubble and dust, evidently the result of tempering its vast frame through the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

Though its body had become smaller, it had grown more condensed and solid.

The Heaven Devouring Battle Art devoured the Spiritual Qi of all things to strengthen the user; combined with the Stone Puppet tribe’s innate divine talents, the two complemented one another perfectly.

The Incarnation was now only a few stories tall, yet it remained a substantial creature.

The various rare minerals Yang Kai had fed it had all been consumed, refined, and absorbed into its strength.

Because it was not a flesh-and-blood body, Yang Kai could not sense the Incarnation’s qi and blood and did not know precisely how much power it could display; still…Yang Kai estimated it would not be weak.

While he was thinking, the Incarnation seemed to sense his intent and suddenly opened its eyes. A simple, honest smile spread across its dull face as it rumbled, "Want to give it a try?"

"Sure!" Yang Kai tilted his head and waved at the Incarnation.

The Incarnation chuckled oddly and slowly rose to its feet.

As it stood, the accumulated stones and dust scattered to the ground.

Since the Incarnation was the product of a sliver of Yang Kai’s Divine Soul poured into a Stone Puppet’s body, Yang Kai could clearly perceive its thoughts and control its actions.

The Incarnation was both an individual and a fragmentary duplicate of Yang Kai.

With a thought, Yang Kai let the Incarnation act freely.

In the next instant, the Incarnation set off with thunderous strides, barreling straight at Yang Kai. Suddenly it dipped low, and a left hook swept out, skimming the ground as it came.

Before the fist arrived, gale-force wind had already brushed Yang Kai’s face, billowing his robes.

Moreover, the force that burst from that fist had plowed a deep, curved trench into the earth.

Seeing this, Yang Kai narrowed his eyes; intending to use sixty percent of his strength, he instead surged to full power and threw a punch to meet it.

Boom…

The larger and smaller fists struck, producing an earth-shattering roar.

A halo of power radiated out from the point of contact like a circular blade, cleaving space in two.

The Incarnation grinned with a strange smile.

Yang Kai’s expression turned grim; in the next instant he felt an almost insurmountable force hit his right side, and with a muffled groan he was hurled away, vanishing from sight in a blink.

In a contest of raw strength, Yang Kai had been utterly defeated!

Only then did the Incarnation rise, hand to its brow as it gazed into the distance, whistling lightly.

A figure flashed ahead and Yang Kai abruptly returned.

Now he grimaced, shaking his right fist; the flesh on his hand was bloodied and torn, and bone showed through.

"How was it?" the Incarnation asked with a chuckle.

"As if you don’t know!" Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes.
