## Chapter 1336 — Convergence

At the break of dawn, when darkness is at its deepest before the first light, a figure silently shot out from Dragon Lair Mountain and vanished in an instant.

Half an hour later, a thousand li north of Tianyun City, that figure reappeared—Yang Kai—who glanced around before darting toward a nearby small hillock.

By now two people had already arrived on the hillock, sitting cross-legged in meditation; both were young men, and, to Yang Kai's surprise, each only possessed the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Yang Kai made no attempt to conceal himself and leapt straight onto the hillock; barely had he steadied himself when the two opened their eyes and glanced at him. One, a slightly more mature-looking man, gave him a cool look and, saying nothing, closed his eyes again.

The other, however, appraised him with interest and offered a slight nod.

Yang Kai nodded back, but neither side seemed inclined to speak. The hillock was spacious, and while curious, Yang Kai promptly found a place to sit cross-legged.

Earlier, when he heard Fei Zhi Tu say that this operation was extremely dangerous, he had thought the man would bring along quite a few Origin Returning Realm masters. After all, Fei Zhi Tu had clearly stated that if not for the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit’s power, with Yang Kai’s own strength, he wouldn’t even qualify to take part in this mission.

Who would have known that upon arriving at the rendezvous he would find two practitioners with the same realm as him?

Doubts aside, Yang Kai knew Fei Zhi Tu had his reasons for bringing these people. Either they possessed special abilities Fei Zhi Tu needed, or they were elite among elites.

The former seemed more likely.

On the hillock the three kept silent; after about half an incense stick's time, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and looked toward the distance, where a streak of radiance was rapidly approaching—another arriving warrior.

Because Fei Zhi Tu's mission was highly confidential, everyone traveled separately, which did not surprise Yang Kai.

When the rainbow-like light drew near and settled on the hillock, a graceful figure emerged—a woman, lithe and fair, her black hair glossy and strikingly beautiful.

Yet this woman's cultivation was also only the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, which puzzled Yang Kai.

Counting himself, there were now four Saint King Realm practitioners gathered; where was Fei Zhi Tu? Could he really be counting on these four Saint King Realm warriors to rescue Qian Tong?

At the thought, Yang Kai's expression darkened.

The woman, upon landing, noticed the three best spots were already taken and frowned.

The man who had earlier shown friendliness toward Yang Kai rose with delight and cupped his fist: "So it's Miss Sisi—it's been a year since we last met. I hope you've been well, Miss Sisi."

From his tone it was clear he knew her, and from his expression he seemed rather taken with her.

The woman called Sisi glanced at him coldly and said, "Cai He? You came too? Lord Fei's taste isn't great—he even brought a formation master like you. This trip looks uncertain."

Though mocked, Cai He showed no offense. He explained, "Lord Fei originally invited my father, but he is in seclusion and couldn't go, so I came instead. I hope we'll cooperate well on this trip and that you can lend your guidance."

"Hmph!" Sisi snorted, her pretty face full of disdain. "I wouldn't dare claim to teach you. Your Cai family's research in formations can't compare to ours Du family, but you have some insights; just don't hold me back."

"Of course, of course!" Cai He laughed meekly, appearing spineless, which drew a hint of contempt from the other man.

Listening, Yang Kai finally understood why Fei Zhi Tu had brought these two Saint King Realm warriors: they specialized in formation arts, and their entire families were known for it. Fei Zhi Tu had indeed made preparations.

Du Sisi glanced at the indifferent man and Yang Kai, arrogantly asking, "Who are these two? Were they invited by Lord Fei as well? Why do their realms match ours?"

Her disdain for Saint King Realm practitioners made Yang Kai frown—this woman was plainly arrogant.

Cai He smiled awkwardly. "I don't know their origins either. If you don't mind, why not introduce yourselves? We're about to travel together; it's better to be acquainted for future cooperation."

Compared to Du Sisi, Cai He had a gentler temperament—courteous with her and warm when addressing Yang Kai and the other man, inspiring a sense of closeness.

"Lian Guang!" The taciturn man spoke sparingly, giving only his name before falling silent.

Hearing the name Lian..., Du Sisi and Cai He both changed expression, casting him a wary look as if his surname carried weight.

Yang Kai glanced at him curiously.

The Lian family was famous in this area, its renown across Dark Star rivaling many sects. Even someone as ignorant as Yang Kai had heard of them, testifying to their reputation.

The Lian family wasn't large in numbers—only about a hundred members—and its strongest was merely First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Such a clan would be common on Dark Star, yet the Lian family was unusually well-known.

The reason was simple: the Lian family excelled in puppet techniques.

Their disciples were skilled at forging and commanding puppets. Though their cultivations weren't high, their combat effectiveness surpassed peers due to the myriad puppets they deployed; in battle, multiple puppets would swarm a single enemy, or even dozens would attack together.

Rumor held the Lian family possessed several puppets whose strength rivaled the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; just these few constructs were enough to intimidate many.

Once a far stronger family coveted the Lian family's puppet secrets and tried to annihilate them to seize the techniques, but despite committing their entire clan, they failed—and were instead wiped out by the Lian family.

That battle spread the Lian family's fame, as their powerful puppets shone on the field, slaying countless foes and inspiring both envy and dread.

The Lian family was shrewd; knowing that treasure invites trouble, they allied with Yingyue Hall and annually forged puppets for them, sheltering themselves under Yingyue Hall's protection and deterring would-be aggressors.

Thus when Lian Guang introduced himself, Du Sisi and Cai He were startled; though their families were not weak and versed in formations, their reputations still paled compared to the Lian family.

Yang Kai pondered that Fei Zhi Tu had brought Du Sisi and Cai He to dispel seals and formations in the ancient ruin—reasonable enough. But why bring someone from the Lian family?

After announcing his name, Lian Guang fell silent again, seemingly born reticent.

Du Sisi and Cai He turned their gazes toward Yang Kai; when he announced his own name, their expressions grew strange.

Cai He scrutinized Yang Kai and asked in disbelief, "Brother Yang, you can't be the one who made a ruckus in Tianyun City a few days ago, can you?"

Yang Kai let out an awkward laugh. "If no one else went to make trouble in Tianyun City, then it should have been me!"

Cai He was immediately impressed, and even Du Sisi's proud demeanor softened; Lian Guang opened his eyes to look Yang Kai over again.

Though their clans were not small, none would dare rampage through Tianyun City; even more astonishing was that after causing such chaos Yang Kai was unpunished and had instead been invited by Fei Zhi Tu to join this operation.

The three were astonished, uncertain what agreement Yang Kai had struck with Fei Zhi Tu that spared him from reprisal.

They knew some matters were best left unasked, so they did not pry. After learning Yang Kai's identity, Cai He warmed to him and soon chatted amiably.

Through the conversation Yang Kai learned why Cai He's attitude had shifted: the Cai family had many grievances with the Xie Family and had suffered losses at Xie's hands. When Yang Kai slew Xie Quan, an Origin Returning Realm expert, in Tianyun City, many who hated the Xie Family cheered—among them the Cai family.

By slaying Xie Quan, Yang Kai had avenged them; who could begrudge such a thing?

Cai He, of the Cai family, naturally regarded Yang Kai favorably.

Du Sisi chose a spot and sat down to adjust her breath with closed eyes.

After another half hour, several figures suddenly and eerily appeared on the hillock, startling the three Saint King Realm practitioners—only Yang Kai remained calm, for his strong Divine Sense had already detected them.
