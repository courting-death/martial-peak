## Chapter 300 — It Is Indeed This Seat!

Time flies.

In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, slightly moving his stiff body. A series of explosive sounds, like frying beans, echoed from all parts of his body. He felt an inexhaustible power within him, and his True Yuan surged, creating an unprecedentedly wonderful state.

Fourth Stage of True Yuan Realm!

These ten days of meditation, combined with the pure energy he had extracted from the white silkworm cocoon of Shan Qingluo, had allowed him to break through to this level, yielding tremendous gains.

Two gazes were directed at him from across the way. Yang Kai looked up to see the enchanting woman lazily leaning against the cave wall, her beautiful eyes filled with a complex expression as they looked at him.

Yang Kai was startled, and his True Yuan involuntarily began to circulate within him.

Shan Qingluo chuckled softly, biting her red lips, "If I wanted to kill you, I would have done so long ago. No matter how many lives you have, it wouldn't be enough."

Yang Kai's face flushed with embarrassment, thinking that she was indeed correct. He relaxed his demeanor, chuckling and clasping his fists, "Thank you, sister, for sparing my life."

Shan Qingluo shook her head, "I never intended to kill you. Bringing you here was also out of necessity."

As she spoke, she couldn't help but cough lightly, her complexion slightly pale.

"What’s wrong with you?" Yang Kai frowned as he looked at her. The aura she exuded now was significantly weaker than before, and it seemed she had also sustained injuries.

"Isn't it all your doing?" Shan Qingluo bit her lip, her phoenix eyes revealing a look of sorrow.

"Me?" Yang Kai pointed at himself, bewildered and somewhat at a loss.

"What have you done to me?"

"I didn't do anything!" Yang Kai replied, confused.

"Then why has so much of my energy been siphoned off by you?" Shan Qingluo gritted her teeth in anger.

Yang Kai was taken aback, recalling their previous encounter. He furrowed his brows and said, "I fell into an illusion, and we... shared a bed, then I used a set of techniques to escape from the illusion..."

Shan Qingluo's face turned slightly red. She looked at him in disbelief, "With me?"

"Yes, you were quite proactive and bold," Yang Kai nodded vigorously, recalling her performance on the fragrant bed, feeling a surge of blood rush to his head. "What a pity!" Yang Kai sighed deeply, feeling somewhat regretful.

"You little rascal!" Shan Qingluo lightly scolded, her face flushed.

"Does it have any effect on you?" Yang Kai asked with a frown.

"What do you think?" Shan Qingluo took a deep breath, her ample chest rising and falling. Her red garments were nearly torn apart, "I was in the midst of a breakthrough, and you siphoned off my energy... Heh, do you think it has no effect?"

Yang Kai suddenly felt embarrassed, "Could it be? I didn't know."

"If you had known, I would have killed you long ago," Shan Qingluo glared at him with resentment, "Why would I have kept you around until now?"

"So you didn't break through?" Yang Kai's gaze flickered.

"No! Not only did I fail to break through, but I also suffered a backlash from my techniques, causing my strength to plummet! Who knows how long it will take for my next breakthrough? Tell me, is this not your fault?"

"How can this be blamed on me..." Yang Kai pinched his nose, but hearing her say that her strength had dropped, he relaxed his demeanor even more. With a meaningful look, he asked, "So what level are you at now?"

"First Stage of True Yuan Realm. Are you satisfied?" Shan Qingluo replied irritably, shooting him a flirtatious glance.

"Why didn't you say so earlier!" Yang Kai laughed heartily, the last remnants of his restraint and caution completely vanishing. He felt entirely at ease.

This enchanting woman was only at the First Stage of True Yuan Realm, lower than his own realm, so he no longer had to fear her.

However, although her realm was lower than his, she was still a formidable expert. If it came to a fight, it was uncertain who would win.

Fortunately, neither of them harbored any murderous intent towards each other, so they should not resort to violence.

"Well, I can't blame you entirely. If I hadn't captured you, I wouldn't have encountered this misfortune! It's all my own doing," Shan Qingluo sighed softly.

Hearing her sincere words, Yang Kai felt a twinge of guilt and awkwardly nodded, "In that case, I should thank you for saving me before."

"You little brat still have a bit of conscience," Shan Qingluo smiled lightly, seeming unaffected by her failed breakthrough, and not at all in a bad mood.

After some idle chatter, Yang Kai suddenly stood up and said, "You rest here, I’ll go find something to eat."

"Be careful!" Shan Qingluo gently reminded.

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise, not understanding why this enchanting woman seemed to care about him now. He didn’t ponder it further and turned to leave the cave.

Once Yang Kai had departed, Shan Qingluo sighed softly, her expression slightly strange. Her delicate hand brushed over her heart, and a blush crept onto her face as she murmured, "A seed of love, huh... sigh..."

Shan Qingluo's lineage was unique, and the techniques she practiced were special. Though she was enchanting and charming, she would only ever fall for one man in her lifetime and would only have relations with that man.

Before that, she had to plant the seed of love in her heart. When the time was ripe, and the seed was full, it would be the moment for them to share a passionate union.

That night, the man would undoubtedly die! At the same time, her cultivation would reach its peak.

Yang Kai's previous boldness had inadvertently penetrated her Sea of Consciousness, leaving a trace of Divine Sense within. This was undoubtedly planting a seed in her heart.

This was the seed of love!

Her lineage was a tragic one, passed down solely through women.

Yet every generation of girls had to endure this inhumane torment.

Shan Qingluo still remembered how her mother had longed for her father throughout her life, suffering immense torment and anguish, ultimately dying in sorrow.

Because the seed of love would only fully blossom when the feelings were deep, to achieve mastery in her techniques, the women of Shan Qingluo's lineage had to give their all, a love that was deeply etched in their hearts.

That night, her beloved would die!

What woman could accept such a fate?

And now, this fate was about to descend upon her.

Biting her red lips, Shan Qingluo felt somewhat at a loss, as she was not prepared at all.

She had initially planned to wait a few more years, find a suitable man to fall for, and nurture the seed of love, but she never expected this matter to come so abruptly.

...

Crackling sounds came from not far away, and a faint meaty aroma lingered in the air. Shan Qingluo fluttered her long eyelashes a few times, slowly opening her eyes.

Yang Kai was not far from her, tending to a campfire with a half-cooked piece of game roasting over it.

"You really are at ease!" Yang Kai chuckled lightly. When he returned earlier, he was surprised to find this enchanting woman asleep.

"What is there to be uneasy about? Are you going to eat me?" Shan Qingluo smiled at Yang Kai.

"Only if you don't mind."

"Just afraid you won't have that fortune!" Shan Qingluo giggled.

After a while, the game was ready. Yang Kai tore off a leg and handed it over. Shan Qingluo took it, slowly tearing off a piece of meat, elegantly chewing it.

In contrast, Yang Kai devoured the remaining game with a rough demeanor.

"Barbaric..." Shan Qingluo shot him a glare.

Yang Kai chuckled and, while eating, asked, "Where is this place? I haven't had the chance to ask you."

"You don't even know where you are?" Shan Qingluo looked at him suspiciously. "Aren't you a disciple of the Sacred Land?"

"Sacred Land? What Sacred Land?" Yang Kai was utterly confused.

Earlier, Shan Qingluo had also asked him which sect he belonged to. Now that he thought about it, it must be related to this Sacred Land.

In utter shock, Yang Kai exclaimed, "Isn't this the Great Han?"

Shan Qingluo laughed lightly, "Are you really confused or just pretending? This is naturally the Great Han!"

Yang Kai awkwardly chuckled, "I truly don't know. I just wandered here in a daze."

Seeing that he didn't seem to be lying, Shan Qingluo straightened her expression and said, "This is the Cangyun Sacred Land!"

"Cangyun Sacred Land? Cangyun Evil Land!" Yang Kai was startled, looking at Shan Qingluo in shock.

"You really are not a disciple of the Sacred Land!" Shan Qingluo frowned, somewhat annoyed, "What evil land? That's such an unpleasant term. What you call evil is simply our path! It's just that our ideas differ; there's no need to make such a clear distinction, which only adds to the world's disputes."

"Cangyun Evil Land... Shan Qingluo..." Yang Kai's mind flashed with insight. He suddenly stood up, looking intently at the enchanting woman across from him, narrowing his eyes as he exclaimed, "The Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo?"

Cangyun Evil Land, under the Evil Lord, there were six great evil kings.

Thunder Beast King, Overlord King, Yin Ming Ghost King, Enchantress Queen, Flashing Lightning King, and Poison King of Annihilation!

Due to the emergence of the Evil Lord, Yang Kai had learned a bit about the Cangyun Evil Land recently, and naturally, he had heard of the titles of the six great evil kings.

Among the six great evil kings, there was only one female!

That was the enchanting and alluring Shan Qingluo before him!

No wonder he felt somewhat familiar when he heard this name before.

Seeing Yang Kai so astonished, Shan Qingluo chuckled lightly, appearing relaxed, "Indeed, it is me! What? Are you scared?"

"Scared?" Yang Kai suddenly grinned, his expression calming down, "What is there to be scared of? It's just that the most enchanting woman in the world is right in front of me, which feels a bit unreal."

As he looked her up and down, he couldn't help but marvel.

The Enchantress Queen, as rumored, was indeed like this. It was true that seeing was believing; she was even more enchanting than he had heard, truly captivating to the extreme.

"Have you seen enough, little rascal?" Shan Qingluo felt uncomfortable under his intense gaze. With a flick of her hand, she hurled a piece of beast meat at him as if it were a hidden weapon.

Yang Kai dodged to the side, allowing her to miss, and he chuckled as he sat back down, frowning in thought.

This time, the void passage had collapsed, sending him to Cangyun Evil Land. This was far from where Su Yan and the others had settled, and it seemed he wouldn't be able to find them for a while.

Moreover, since this was Cangyun Evil Land, there were bound to be many evil beings. How was he supposed to leave?

He needed to establish a good relationship with Shan Qingluo first. With her identity and means, helping him leave Cangyun Evil Land would be a piece of cake.

Resolving his thoughts, Yang Kai tore off another piece of roasted meat and offered it to her.

Shan Qingluo shot him an annoyed glance and huffed, "Something that has your saliva on it... I won't eat it."

"It's not like you haven't eaten it before..." Yang Kai muttered, not pressing her.

Shan Qingluo was instantly infuriated, her chest heaving. She recalled that forced kiss from before, and her silver teeth nearly ground to dust in anger.
