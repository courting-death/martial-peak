## Chapter 1056 — Profound Yin Moon Water

Being a branch leader of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, Halika’s strength reached the Third Stage of Origin Returning Realm, the strongest level just below the Void King Realm.

Even so, Halika was in utter disarray now; his left arm had frozen solid into a block of ice. No matter how he stirred his strength, he could not dispel the cold from his limb; on the contrary, that chill seemed almost sentient, crawling outward toward other parts of his body, threatening to pass his shoulder at any moment.

Halika’s eyes were bloodshot, a flash of terror and resolve flickering through them as he suddenly circulated his power and let out a roar.

With an ear-splitting cry, the frozen arm snapped clean off at the root, and blood spouted from the severed stump like a fountain. Halika’s face drained of color as he staggered back.

He had severed his own arm!

Yang Kai’s pupils constricted; on one hand he was startled by Halika’s decisiveness, on the other he was shocked by the penetrating cold energy.

To force an expert of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm to sever a limb to save his life—whatever that chilling energy was, it possessed terrifying lethality. It was a force Halika could not withstand!

Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman hurried over, stopping Halika’s bleeding while shoving healing pills into his mouth by the handful.

The other warriors who had followed Halika and barely escaped death saw the branch leader’s action and could only grit their teeth, draw blades, and cut away their own frozen sections. In an instant severed limbs flew and blood poured forth; the men cried out in agonizing howls.

Halika sat cross-legged on the ground, quietly running mystical arts to stabilize his wounds, breathing hard, his face still pale with lingering fear.

“What is that?” Lin Mufeng asked anxiously.

“Profound Yin Moon Water!” Halika bit out.

“Profound Yin Moon Water?” the middle-aged woman screamed, “Profound Yin Moon Water? Such a treasure in an ancient ruin?”

Even Lin Mufeng’s heart thudded, and he displayed a look of eager longing.

Profound Yin Moon Water is a Void King-Grade supreme treasure. Any martial artist who can successfully refine even a drop of Profound Yin Moon Water will see a leap in strength! If one’s power is low enough, it can even directly cross an entire Stage.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild focused on commerce, and no force could rival them in researching worldly treasures. Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman naturally understood the immense value of Profound Yin Moon Water.

If they could safely extract the Profound Yin Moon Water from the ancient ruin, it would be a great achievement; they might be transferred to the main star Shuiyue Star to enjoy better cultivation conditions and better treatment.

However, such a thing was exceedingly rare, required extremely harsh generation conditions, and took tens of thousands of years to form.

Hengluo Commerce Guild controlled several cultivation stars, countless medicinal and mining worlds, and countless warriors. In all their years of collecting, they had never seen a supreme treasure like Profound Yin Moon Water.

So when Halika mentioned the words Profound Yin Moon Water, both Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman could not help their eyes shining and their faces flushing with excitement.

“How could Profound Yin Moon Water be under this mining area?” Lin Mufeng still found it hard to believe.

“Perhaps it belonged to some great sage in ancient times and was left here. We discovered it inside a Spatial Ring that was about to be destroyed. The Profound Yin Moon Water suddenly exploded, destroying the Spatial Ring; everyone was stunned,” Halika quickly explained, his face pale. Remembering the earlier scene, he wore the look of one spared from disaster.

If he hadn’t acted quickly, he would have lost more than an arm this time; he might have died without a burial place.

“What about Lady Xue?” Yang Kai asked, his face stern as he stepped forward.

Halika raised his head and looked. He sighed gloomily.

Yang Kai’s expression grew even grimmer.

“The Spatial Ring was in her hands; when the Profound Yin Moon Water detonated, she bore the brunt…” Halika sighed heavily and fell silent.

He assumed that Lady Xue was certain to have died!

After all, she only possessed Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and even an expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm like himself could not withstand the chilling corrosion of the Profound Yin Moon Water. If Lady Xue had been drenched directly, how could she possibly survive?

She was most likely already dead!

Yang Kai snorted coldly. “Is there a map of the lower levels?”

“What are you going to do?” Lin Mufeng asked in surprise.

“She’s not dead!” Yang Kai shot him a cold glance.

“You’ll go save her?” the middle-aged woman immediately saw Yang Kai’s intent and slowly shook her head to dissuade him. “Young man, don’t be rash. If she was drenched by Profound Yin Moon Water, there’s no chance she survived. Going down is only throwing your life away.”

Halika also said, “The lower levels are full of seals; with your low strength you can’t go deep.”

“If she’s alive, we must see her; if she’s dead, we must at least see her body!” Yang Kai said, his face stern.

The branch officials stared at him, and one by one a hint of admiration crossed their faces.

Yang Kai’s public identity was Xue Yue’s guard, and they assumed his insistence was simply due to devotion to his charge—such a guardian was allowed to be reckless. A guard’s most important quality is loyalty, even if strength was lacking.

They instantly felt a measure of respect.

The ring on Halika’s hand shimmered, projecting a sketch that he tossed to Yang Kai. “This is a map we specially drew for the deep exploration to avoid getting lost; if it’s useful, take it.”

Yang Kai took it, glanced at it briefly without a word, and flew off, landing into the mining pit in the blink of an eye.

“Not a bad little guard!” the middle-aged woman murmured with a nod, watching the direction Yang Kai disappeared toward, lamenting, “He likely won’t return alive.”

“He has to go!” Lin Mufeng said calmly. “Lady Xue is Young Master’s woman; if she dies, this youth—being her guard—would never live.”

The middle-aged woman paled at the reminder; the excitement from the Profound Yin Moon Water vanished as she began to worry how they would bear the Young Master’s wrath.

“Hopefully our merits will make up for this.” Halika sighed heavily. “Discovering the Profound Yin Moon Water is a great accomplishment, but if the Young Master’s woman dies because of it, who can say how the Young Master will react?”

The best outcome would be that his merit made up for the loss and the Young Master did not pursue the matter; they would remain at the branch and keep the status quo.

“Old Ha, you rest first,” Lin Mufeng comforted. “We’ll discuss things when you recover some more.”

“There’s nothing else to do.” Halika nodded and closed his eyes to refine the medicine effects.

Yang Kai descended deeper into the mine.

The pit’s depth was unknown; Yang Kai fell for the length of a cup of tea before finally reaching level ground. Looking up, only a faint beam of light descended from above; below the mine was all darkness.

Countless tunnels branched in every direction throughout the underground.

This had originally been a mining area producing low-grade ores, and the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s warriors had messily excavated the depths.

The ancient ruin had been discovered during the mining, and the branch dared not probe it recklessly; they sealed the site and reported it to the main star.

Xue Yue had come this time to handle matters within the ruin.

She had been cautious the whole way. Under Halika’s lead she had ventured in and gained much, but who would expect a Spatial Ring to bring danger? After so long the ring had become unstable. When Xue Yue’s Divine Sense probed it, the ring suddenly broke and the item inside detonated, drenching her with Profound Yin Moon Water.

Immediately she lost consciousness, and a number of the Hengluo Commerce Guild warriors scattered around her fell dead. Only the strongest, Halika, and a few who were farther away escaped and fled.

Yang Kai memorized the sketch, expanded his Divine Sense, and threaded through the tunnels of the mine.

After half an hour he finally reached the site where the ruin had been found.

From ahead he sensed many obscure energy fluctuations and immediately knew Halika had not lied.

The ruin bristled with seals and great danger.

When they had explored before they had tried to avoid the seals as much as possible, breaking or cracking only those they could not circumvent.

Yang Kai, anxious to save someone, had no time to painstakingly dispel every seal.

His Divine Sense Threads pierced the spatial blockade and probed into the ruin. Confirming the situation and locking onto a position, Yang Kai tore the space open.

When he reappeared he stood at a point within the ruin, then followed the route on Halika’s sketch and tore space again.

After a dozen consecutive jumps, he reached deeper inside the ruin and suddenly detected a faint life aura, like a candle wavering in wind and rain, about to be snuffed out at any moment.

Xue Yue!

She lay a hundred zhang away from him, hidden by obstacles so Yang Kai could not see her directly, but the only certainty was that she was not dead!

Yang Kai drew a deep breath to calm himself, sat cross-legged, and swallowed a pill to replenish his consumed Divine Sense.

Half an hour later he rose abruptly, tore space one last time, and dove into the spatial rift.

A hundred zhang away, Yang Kai appeared calmly.

He saw Xue Yue lying on the ground, covered in frost; sleeping, she possessed a bewitching charm like a sleeping beauty.

Within her body a band of seven-colored radiance bloomed, making her appear goddess-like; the radiance constantly fought the frost that covered her, preventing it from taking Xue Yue’s last life, maintaining a strange equilibrium.

But as time passed, the radiance seemed to be dimming.

It was unclear what secret treasure she wore or what cultivation art she practiced that temporarily kept her from death, but if this continued, within half a day once the radiance vanished, Xue Yue would surely die.
