## Chapter 683 — Shirking Responsibility

What truly filled Duan Hai with trepidation was that he had brought Yang Kai back from Leiguang at the behest of Du Wan.

Just moments ago, Xu Qi had told him that someone of Elder Du's status wouldn't likely come to Leiguang seeking someone, yet now Du Wan stood right before him.

Duan Hai's heart raced, but he forced himself to maintain his composure and laughed as he approached, "I am honored to meet Elder Du."

He then cupped his fists towards Cang Yan and greeted, "Brother Cang Yan."

Du Wan nodded slightly.

Xia Chengyin commented, "Elder Du, thank you for your efforts. Please, have a seat."

As Duan Hai took his seat, his expression was slightly unnatural because Cang Yan from Tianxiao Sect had been staring at him with his hawkish eyes, exuding an intimidating air, which made him feel inexplicably uneasy.

Seemingly noticing this, Cang Yan's gaze became even more fierce.

Clearing his throat, Duan Hai inquired softly, "May I ask, what urgent matters require the Leader's summons?"

"Nothing too significant," Xia Chengyin smiled, "Elder Du and Brother Cang Yan have come to Leiguang to find someone."

"Find someone?" Duan Hai’s unease intensified, and the skin on his face twitched slightly as he forced a smile, "Who are you looking for?"

He sensed that something was amiss.

"It is the young man you brought away from the Alchemists' Association two months ago," Du Wan replied, his expression friendly.

Duan Hai felt like crying without tears, secretly cursing Xu Qi, who had spoken those ill-fated words. A person of Elder Du's caliber truly had come to Leiguang to demand someone, leaving him momentarily at a loss for how to respond.

While panic seized his heart, he did not show it on his face, rapidly pondering how to resolve the predicament before him.

"Elder Du?" Elder Du noticed Duan Hai seemed lost in thought and could not help but furrow his brows.

"Ah, right..." Duan Hai quickly adjusted his expression.

"How has the young friend been during his time in Leiguang?" Du Wan asked with concern.

"Very well. I have assigned one of our sect's talented and beautiful female disciples to serve him these past two months. Yang Kai has also produced quite a few high-quality Spirit-Grade Pills for our Divine Cult."

"That is only natural; the understanding that young friend Yang has of alchemy in certain aspects is something even I cannot hope to match."

Upon hearing this, both Xia Chengyin and Cang Yan stared at Du Wan in shock, their eyes gleaming with excitement.

"I am not exaggerating; this is the truth. I believe young friend Yang's alchemical skills must have been guided by someone exceptional."

Duan Hai's expression changed dramatically. He realized from Du Wan's words a problem he had overlooked – could that young man truly possess a strong backing? Or could he be a disciple of some top-notch alchemist? Otherwise, how could Elder Du bestow such high praise upon him?

In an instant, Duan Hai's hands turned cold, and he broke into a cold sweat.

"This young guest is that remarkable?" Xia Chengyin too grew interested, his expression becoming invigorated, "It would be a blessing for our Divine Cult to employ such a talent! Duan Hai, you must not neglect him. From now on, we must provide the best conditions for him; otherwise, Brother Cang Yan may try to poach him."

Duan Hai's mouth twitched as he forced a dry laugh, "I will handle it properly."

"Then where is he now? Elder Du and Brother Cang Yan wish to meet him; Duan Hai, please invite him here," Xia Chengyin asked, his gaze filled with anticipation as he too wanted to see Yang Kai and understand what kind of person could garner such praise from Elder Du.

A bead of sweat formed on Duan Hai's forehead as he remained still.

"Why aren't you going yet?" Xia Chengyin asked, a hint of displeasure in his voice.

"Leader..." Duan Hai's expression turned strained, and he stammered, "Currently... it might be a bit inconvenient for him."

"Where is it inconvenient?" The usually silent Cang Yan suddenly asked coldly, his demeanor unfriendly.

Duan Hai's reluctance, combined with his previous unnatural demeanor, quickly alerted Cang Yan to something unusual. He narrowed his eyes at Duan Hai, a chilling gleam passing through them as he coldly asked, "Could it be that something happened to him?"

"No, no, no, nothing happened to him," Duan Hai hurriedly waved his hands, "It's just that it truly is inconvenient at the moment."

"Duan Hai!" Xia Chengyin's face darkened, "What is going on? Elder Du and Brother Cang Yan have come personally just to meet that young guest; why are you making excuses? This is not how we treat guests in our Divine Cult."

"Leader..."

"Where exactly is he?" Xia Chengyin asked impatiently.

Realizing that further delays would only worsen the situation, Duan Hai gritted his teeth, "He is over at the Wind Eye."

"Why would he be at the Wind Eye?" Du Wan's expression changed.

Du Wan had certainly heard of the Wind Eye and Thunder Eye of the Leiguang Divine Cult; they were the ideal training grounds for cultivators specializing in wind and thunder attributes. What business did Yang Kai, an alchemist, have at the Wind Eye?

"He mentioned needing the power of the Wind Eye to refine a Spirit-Grade Pill, so I took him there," Duan Hai thought quickly, coming up with a good excuse.

Cang Yan turned his gaze toward Du Wan, seeking confirmation.

Du Wan nodded slightly, "That is a possibility; alchemists often achieve greater results when borrowing the power of the heavens and the earth during pill refinement, but this requires profound skill and technique. Otherwise, it would be impossible to activate the heavenly forces. This young friend is indeed remarkable."

Duan Hai could not help but breathe a sigh of relief, secretly thinking that this excuse of his was a masterstroke.

"Since he is at the Wind Eye, how about you both stay in my Divine Cult for a few days? We can meet after that young guest comes out," Xia Chengyin suggested, looking at Elder Du and Cang Yan.

Elder Du smiled slightly, "I have no objections. What about you, Cang Yan?"

"I want to see him now!" Cang Yan replied coldly, his tone betraying a sense of unfriendliness.

Xia Chengyin chuckled, "Brother Cang Yan, you must have heard that the Wind Eye and Thunder Eye are forbidden areas of our Divine Cult, and outsiders are not permitted to enter. Moreover, if we go over now, we may disturb him during his alchemy. Could you wait a few days?"

"What nonsensical forbidden area!" Cang Yan scoffed. After saying this, he released his massive divine sense to probe the area, ceasing conversation with the two from Leiguang. He stood up and flew directly toward the location of the Wind Eye.

"Hey, Brother Cang Yan!" Duan Hai gasped, wishing to stop him, but it was already too late.

"This uncle's temper is quite hasty," Mi Na observed, relishing the chaos. Seeing Cang Yan fly off, she excitedly urged Du Wan, "Elder Du, let us go as well."

Du Wan glanced at Xia Chengyin, whose expression was clouded. Cang Yan's blatant disrespect enraged him, yet he felt powerless since Cang Yan had already left. After pondering for a moment, he stated, "Then let us go take a look."

With that, he also stood.

"I appreciate your help, Sect Leader," Du Wan said apologetically.

"Elder Du, you are too kind," Xia Chengyin naturally dared not show any displeasure toward this Saint-Grade alchemist.

The small group hurriedly followed behind Cang Yan, quickly making their way toward the Wind Eye.

Duan Hai's face turned pale as a sense of chaos enveloped him. He thought he could delay them for a few days and use that time to escape the Divine Cult of Leiguang, avoiding this calamity, but unexpectedly, he faltered at the last minute.

If he tried to leave now, it would only arouse suspicion.

Following behind Xia Chengyin and Du Wan, Duan Hai's mind was in turmoil as he secretly felt that this time could spell big trouble.

Before long, they all arrived at the location of the Wind Eye, with Cang Yan being the first to arrive.

Gazing at the swirling vortex filled with concentrated wind energy, Cang Yan could not help but reveal a hint of caution. Such destructive power made even him hesitate.

After scanning the surroundings, Cang Yan did not spot Yang Kai, and his expression instantly soured.

Xu Qi, who had been stationed here, was bewildered, unsure of what had transpired. Upon seeing Xia Chengyin and Du Wan, he felt a surge of panic, feigning calmness to greet them before turning to Duan Hai to ask, "Senior Brother, what happened?"

"Elder Du and Brother Cang Yan want to see how Yang Kai's pill refining is going," Duan Hai replied casually.

Xu Qi's eyes flashed with brilliance as he instantly grasped the implications behind Duan Hai's words.

The two had spent years working together, not that they could be said to have a deep connection, but occasionally with a shared glance or a simple phrase, they could effortlessly convey their meanings to one another.

"Where is he?" Cang Yan turned his head, coldly staring at Duan Hai.

Duan Hai opened his mouth, unsure of how to respond. He quickly looked at Xu Qi, "Junior Brother, where is Yang Kai? When I left just now, wasn't he still outside?"

Xu Qi understood immediately and answered, "He went inside; he said it would be more convenient for refining pills in there."

"He went inside?" Everyone's faces turned pale.

"How could he have gone in?" Elder Du's lips trembled, "Even if he is at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, just reaching the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm and going in would mean certain death! How could you let him in?"

Xu Qi chuckled awkwardly, "I couldn't stop him. Yang Kai said not to worry, he has ways to protect himself."

"This... this..." Du Wan's face grew anxious.

Cang Yan, who had been silent, unleashed his immense divine sense, probing into the chaotic Wind Eye. In mere moments, he could not help but grunt in pain and stagger back several steps, his complexion turning pale.

He had attempted to use his divine sense to investigate the situation inside the Wind Eye but inevitably sustained some damage.

His gaze flickered as Cang Yan coldly regarded Duan Hai and Xu Qi, "Did he go in of his own accord or were you the ones who forced him in?"

Xia Chengyin's brow furrowed with irritation, "What do you mean by this, Brother Cang Yan? Do you believe that the elders of my Divine Cult would harm a young guest?"

Cang Yan coldly chuckled, his hawk-like gaze surveying Duan Hai and Xu Qi, his aura growing increasingly dangerous.

Duan Hai and Xu Qi dared not meet his gaze, their eyes flickering with unease.

Noticing the change, Du Wan's expression sank. Reflecting on Duan Hai's continual evasion from before, he too began to sense something was amiss.

Everyone present was among the strongest of the strong and were naturally not foolish. Although Duan Hai and Xu Qi sang from the same hymn sheet and wove an airtight lie, subtle clues still indicated otherwise to them.

"What exactly is going on?" Xia Chengyin inquired coldly, his expression darkening as he looked at the two elders, "Brother Cang Yan has expressed doubts about my Divine Cult; you both need to clarify this for me!" 

"Leader, please see reason," Duan Hai said loudly, "Yang Kai's alchemical skills are extraordinary; we have treated him with the utmost respect, how could we possibly harm him!"
