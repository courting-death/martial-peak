## Chapter 2556 — Great Emperor Youhun

That mysterious expert chose to perform Soul Descent on Elder Fu for his own reasons. For one, Lin'er was a girl, which would be somewhat inconvenient, and for another, Elder Fu was much stronger than Lin'er, so Soul Descent on him would allow for more methods to be used. Besides, even if Elder Fu's body suffered damage afterward, it wouldn't matter.

When an expert performs Soul Descent, it places a tremendous burden on the weaker person's body.

Under Yang Kai's gaze, Elder Fu, who had been lying on the ground, stood up straight. His hair, white as snow, fluttered without wind, and his eyes were deep as the sea, inspiring awe.

In the blink of an eye, Elder Fu's demeanor changed drastically. His gaze swept over the room, seeming to look down on all under heaven, exuding authority.

Elder Fu's eyes swept once, pausing on Yang Kai for a moment before turning to Lin'er. His expression was indifferent, betraying no hint of joy or anger.

At that moment, Lin'er seemed to realize what was happening. She reached for her neck where her pendant used to be, glanced at Elder Fu, and, meeting the familiar gaze, couldn't help but shrink back, already aware of what had transpired.

"Father..." she called softly, her voice barely audible. She wasn't happy at all that her father had performed Soul Descent; instead, her face was full of fear.

"Hmph!" Elder Fu snorted coldly and said, "Shouldn't you be in seclusion reflecting on your mistakes? Why are you here?"

Lin'er was left speechless by the question, her eyes timid, not daring to meet his gaze at all.

Yang Kai's heart stirred. So this young lady snuck out, no wonder she's so scared even with her father performing Soul Descent. Why do these little girls do this? Mo Xiaoqi often sneaks out of Spirit Beast Island too. This one is no different.

They're all spoiled. Yang Kai snorted inwardly.

"What trouble have you caused now!" Elder Fu asked.

Lin'er didn't answer, her eyes darting around as if searching for an escape route.

"Why don't you answer when I ask you!" Elder Fu suddenly shouted.

Liner's body trembled, and she blurted out reflexively, "Your daughter was bullied..."

As she spoke, tears streamed down her pale cheeks, as sorrowful as could be. Gone was her previous arrogance; she was a completely different person now.

Yang Kai was stunned, thinking this young lady's acting skills were truly impressive. She must do this often.

Those tears came so easily, flowing like water, as if they cost nothing. She cried her heart out, looking as if she had truly suffered, and even pointed at Yang Kai, saying, "It was him. He even tried to kill me. Father, you must stand up for me!"

Elder Fu’s face remained impassive as he said, “Who would dare bully you? Isn’t it always you throwing your weight around, stirring up trouble wherever you go, and finally getting taught a lesson?”

He seemed to know his daughter very well, so he didn't believe her at all and cut straight to the point.

Lin'er's crying stopped abruptly. She stared at Elder Fu with her mouth agape.

"The Lord is truly wise!" Yang Kai quickly cupped his fists, smiling.

Elder Fu turned to look at Yang Kai and said indifferently, "This Lord is speaking to his daughter. When did it become your turn to interrupt?"

Yang Kai couldn't help but purse his lips, feeling thoroughly annoyed.

Elder Fu said, "You don't seem surprised to see This Lord?"

Yang Kai snorted, "What's there to be surprised about? If it weren't for your protection, with your daughter's temper and knack for causing trouble, she wouldn't have survived till now. Who knows where she'd have died already."

This guy wasn't polite to him at all, so Yang Kai didn't bother being nice either. After all, he wasn't in the wrong this time. He didn't believe Elder Fu would really bully the weak and do anything to him.

Feng Xi's father, Feng Xuan, could shamelessly stand up for his son, but this one absolutely wouldn't. He had to care about his own status. That's exactly why Yang Kai wasn't afraid at all.

Lin'er looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, never expecting him to be so bold, speaking like that to her father. Not just anyone could do that.

How did I end up provoking someone like this? Lin'er regretted it deeply.

Elder Fu’s eyes sharpened, his voice cold and stern. “Boy, are you accusing This Lord of failing to discipline his own daughter?”

Yang Kai snorted and ignored him. Such an obvious matter—why ask just to embarrass himself?

Elder Fu saw his calm demeanor and was quite surprised, saying, "You're not afraid of this Lord?"

Yang Kai glanced at him and said, "Why should I be?"

If it were before he went to the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai might have been afraid, but now he'd seen plenty. He'd even met the Mortal Great Emperor and the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, so he was well experienced.

"Do you know who this Lord is?" Elder Fu asked again.

Yang Kai paused for a moment, then cupped his fists and said, "Junior Yang Kai greets Great Emperor Youhun!"

This salute was not out of fear, but respect for an expert.

Elder Fu was truly shocked now. Yang Kai had called out his identity in one go, showing he knew exactly who he was dealing with.

Just as Yang Kai said, the one who performed Soul Descent was none other than one of the Star Realm's Ten Great Emperors, Great Emperor Youhun, the overlord of the Eastern Territory and founder of the Soul Palace.

The Soul Contracts that circulate throughout the Star Realm were also created by him.

Yang Kai was able to figure it out simply by observing how the people from the Netherworld Sect treated Lin'er. The Netherworld Sect was one of the top sects in the Eastern Territory—if Lin'er's status wasn't even higher than theirs, why would they be so respectful toward her?

Who else could hold a status even loftier than the Netherworld Sect? 

Putting all the pieces together, it wasn't hard to figure out.

"How did you know?" Elder Fu raised his eyebrows.

Yang Kai chuckled, "I guessed."

Elder Fu's eyes flickered, but he didn't pursue the matter. After a moment's thought, he asked, "Since you knew Lin'er's background, why did you dare try to kill her? Could it be... you wanted to draw this Lord out?"

This old man was really sharp...

Since he'd been exposed, Yang Kai didn't hide it anymore. He cupped his fists and said, "Your insight is keen, my Lord. That was indeed my intention."

Of course, if he hadn't shown up, Yang Kai really would have killed her. Lin'er had provoked him several times and nearly got him killed by the people of the Netherworld Sect. Yang Kai couldn't just let that slide.

Elder Fu asked curiously, "You went to such lengths to draw this Lord out—what for?"

Yang Kai sighed, his face bitter, "My lord, I had no choice. Your daughter forced me into it."

“What does that have to do with me?” Lin’er was no longer flustered. With her father’s soul having descended here, her life was certainly safe. What worried her now was only how long she would be locked in confinement after being taken back.

Yang Kai glanced at her and said irritably, "If you didn't have this background, do you think you'd still be alive to talk?"

Lin'er snorted, turning her head away, unwilling to argue. But recalling how Yang Kai had just swung his sword at her without hesitation, she couldn't help but feel a lingering fear. She knew he was right—without her father's protection, she'd be dead.

Yang Kai frowned and cupped his fists, "Great Emperor Youhun, your daughter has made things difficult for me time and again. I didn't want to stoop to her level—a little girl being mischievous is understandable. But I've let her off again and again, and not only did she not appreciate it, she even colluded with the people of the Netherworld Sect to ambush me here. That was truly intolerable, so in my anger, I killed more than twenty of the Netherworld Sect's people right here..."

Elder Fu looked over. He'd noticed the corpses earlier, but hadn't realized they were from the Netherworld Sect.

Was this kid really that capable? He was only at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, so how could he kill so many?

Yang Kai continued, "The people of Netherworld Sect deserved to die, but I really didn't dare go too far with your daughter!"

"You... you're lying!" Lin'er pointed angrily at Yang Kai, shouting, "You were clearly trying to kill me just now!"

Yang Kai sneered, "If I didn't make sure your life wasn't in danger, how could I have drawn out the Lord!"

Elder Fu narrowed his eyes at Yang Kai, "After drawing out this Lord, what did you intend to do?"

Yang Kai paused for a moment, then said, "My lord, I wouldn't dare kill your daughter, but I can't just swallow my anger either. So naturally, I had to draw you out and reason with you—after all, your fists are bigger than mine."

Elder Fu let out a cold laugh.

What does that mean, does he think being bullied is just how it should be? Yang Kai's anger flared, and he said, "My lord, I nearly lost my life because of your daughter. Look at this wound—it's very painful."

Elder Fu's gaze dropped to the long, foot-wide gash on Yang Kai's chest, and he was somewhat moved.

To suffer such a serious injury and still remain calm, speaking so frankly to him—this kid was truly something. Wasn't he afraid he might just crush him on the spot?

"This Lord understands. So how do you intend to reason with this Lord?" Elder Fu looked at Yang Kai with interest. "This Lord is right here. Say what you want—if you wait too long, you won't get another chance."

Yang Kai's face darkened, "My lord, you wouldn't be thinking of killing me to silence me, would you? With your status, if word got out, where would your reputation be?"

Elder Fu said, "No matter your motives, the fact remains you tried to kill this Lord's daughter. So what if this Lord kills you?"

Yang Kai was furious, "So the lord is going to bully the weak, using his power to oppress me?"

This old man was shameless. Yang Kai had thought that as one of the Ten Great Emperors, he'd care about his reputation, but who knew he'd be so brazen.

Lin'er, on the other hand, was delighted, shouting, "Father, stop talking to him and just kill him already!"

Elder Fu smirked, looking at Yang Kai, "Are you scared?"

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, "Scared of what? I've fought side by side with the Mortal Great Emperor before, and I've seen what Great Emperors can do. I'm not some country bumpkin—what's there to be afraid of?"

Elder Fu's expression turned odd, "You fought alongside that old Mortal Great Emperor?"

Yang Kai snorted, "That's right. If your true body had descended, I'd have run for my life without a second thought. But right now, you're only here with a strand of your soul—how much power can you really wield? Forgive my bluntness, but before I die, I could easily drag your daughter down with me. I wonder, do you actually care about her life?"
