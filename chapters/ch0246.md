## Chapter 246 — Entering the Trap

Hearing this, Yang Kai expressed his concern, "Is your Senior Brother Chi Xue nearby? If Chi Xue is also present, then we are in serious trouble."

Chi Xue is a master at the Seventh Stage of the True Yuan Realm, and he even enslaved a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast, making him quite formidable.

Zi Mo sighed, "I hope he isn't."

An hour later, the three finally arrived at their destination. Zi Mo slid down from Yang Kai's back, casting him a grateful glance as she tidied her clothes and disheveled hair. With a frosty expression, she led the way towards the gathering.

From a distance, Yang Kai spotted many Demonic Beasts and a dozen figures clustered together.

As Zi Mo approached, two individuals stood up—Yao He and Yao Xi from the Senluo Palace. The pair, a man and a woman, looked over with smiles, showing no hint of guilt. With a command, over a hundred Demonic Beasts scattered, surrounding Zi Mo's army of Demonic Beasts.

"Senior Sister has finally arrived," Yao He said with a frivolous expression, clearly looking down on Zi Mo. He greeted her with a light laugh, while Yao Xi giggled disdainfully at her.

"Weren't you the ones who summoned me?" Zi Mo replied coldly, stopping about ten zhang away from them.

The three disciples of Senluo Palace faced off against each other, the air thick with tension.

Yang Kai stood behind Zi Mo, scanning the area and recognizing many familiar faces.

About ten zhang away, four young women from Wan Hua Palace sat cross-legged on the ground, their expressions bleak. Ye Qingsi and Zhou Ba from the Shura Sect, along with Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu from the Yingyue Sect, were huddled together. In addition, disciples from Twin Island, Shui Yue Hall, Wen Xin Palace, and Fei Yu Pavilion were also among the survivors.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu exchanged bitter smiles, sharing a sense of sorrow as fellow wanderers in misfortune.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, acknowledging them. Their group still had about sixteen or seventeen members left, but their original numbers should have been higher. Many must have perished during this time.

"You two, get to the side!" Yao He ordered, glancing at Yang Kai and Leng Shan with an air of authority.

Zi Mo nodded slightly.

Only then did Yang Kai and Leng Shan move towards Chen Xueshu and the others.

As they gathered, a girl from Wan Hua Palace looked at Yang Kai and sighed, "You haven't escaped misfortune either."

Yang Kai smiled, "Indeed. May I ask for your name, Miss?"

During their last encounter, when Wu Chengyi had made things difficult for him, this girl had spoken up for him, leaving Yang Kai with a good impression of her. The four sisters—Chunlan, Qiuhua—were all striking in their own right, creating a beautiful scene when seated together.

The girl forced a smile, "Han Xiao Qi!"

Another girl, looking a bit more playful, pouted, "You, having become a prisoner, still have the mood to inquire about a girl's name? You don't seem like a good person."

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow at her, "Haven't you heard the saying that a man should be true to his nature? I haven't yet asked for your name, Miss..."

The girl pouted, "Ye Han!"

Over there, Ye Qingsi chuckled, "We share the same surname. If we survive this, I must form a bond of brotherhood with you, Sister Han."

Han Xiao Qi smiled as she introduced her other two junior sisters: the more serene one named Hua Ruoyin and the more charming one named Liu Qingru.

As fellow wanderers in misfortune, the presence of Yang Kai prompted others to introduce themselves as well.

Feng Qianhen from Shui Yue Hall, Zuo Fang and Li Xinyuan from Wen Xin Palace, Chu Jingshan from Fei Yu Pavilion...

The elite disciples from various sects gathered together, creating a lively atmosphere that eased the worries and fears accumulated over the past few days.

"Hmph, facing death, you still have the mood to chat. You can talk about these things after surviving," an out-of-place voice interrupted the laughter, sounding extremely abrupt.

Yang Kai turned to look, seeing a man sneering at him.

With a flicker of his gaze, Yang Kai paid it no mind.

Ye Qingsi coldly laughed, "Bi Xiuming. Ever since being captured, you've been pouring cold water on us every few days. What do you mean by that?"

Bi Xiuming sneered, "Nothing much. Just a useless person has arrived. Is it worth your joy? Do you really expect him to save us?"

Chen Xueshu frowned, "If you think you have no hope of survival, then just end it yourself. Why ruin the mood for others? And don’t slander Brother Yang; he is merely at a lower Realm."

Bi Xiuming said nothing. However, another person beside him chuckled, "A low Realm means he is useless! I really don't understand how a waste like him has survived this long. He should have died long ago instead of dragging on."

This person was likely from the same sect as Bi Xiuming, being fellow Senior Brother and Junior Brother, naturally standing on the same side.

Han Xiao Qi coldly remarked, "You talk too much."

Ye Han, Hua Ruoyin, and Liu Qingru glared at him indignantly.

Although Bi Xiuming and his companion looked down on Yang Kai, they did not wish to provoke the collective anger and snorted, falling silent.

Their disturbance ruined the original atmosphere, leaving everyone feeling heavy-hearted.

Ye Han puffed her cheeks and comforted, "Yang Kai, right? Don't mind them. These two are always pessimistic and can't stand to see others in a good mood."

Yang Kai shook his head, "I don't mind. It's just dogs barking."

Han Xiao Qi was taken aback, then stifled a laugh.

"What did you say?" Bi Xiuming and his companion opened their eyes wide, glaring at Yang Kai with murderous intent.

"If your ears aren't deaf, you should have heard clearly," Yang Kai replied, maintaining a calm expression.

"You're courting death!" Bi Xiuming shouted angrily, standing up abruptly.

"Do you all want to die?" Yao He bellowed from the side, "If you want to die, I can fulfill that wish right now!"

Bi Xiuming glanced at Yao He with trepidation, then reluctantly sat back down, glaring at Yang Kai with anger, "You wait, I will make you pay!"

"Sure, I will wait," Yang Kai nodded indifferently.

The atmosphere among the Great Han martial artists was explosive, while the tension between the three from the Tianlang Sect was equally delicate.

Since Zi Mo returned, Yao He and Yao Xi merely gazed at her with smiles, remaining silent.

After a long while, Zi Mo let out a slight breath and coldly asked, "Why are you doing this?"

Yao He chuckled lightly, "Why? Senior Sister, do you really not understand?"

"Is it just because the Master favored me a bit more in the sect?" Zi Mo scoffed.

Yao He and Yao Xi's expressions shifted slightly, their faces turning cold.

Zi Mo continued, "You entered the sect before me, yet your strength hasn't grown as quickly as mine. In the end, you are unwilling and only call me Senior Sister. Is this your justification and excuse?"

"Do you really think you are exceptionally talented?" Yao Xi scoffed, "If not for the Master providing you with more resources, how could you surpass us? Based solely on individual talent, we are no less than you."

"You have never been better than me!" Zi Mo retorted without backing down.

A hint of disdain appeared on Yao He's face, "Oh? Then may I ask, Senior Sister, did you ever foresee this situation?"

"I truly did not expect you to be so vicious, daring to lay hands on me!" Zi Mo's face was filled with hatred.

Yao He sneered, "Enough, I won't say more. After all, you are still Senior Sister! We called you here for no other reason than that we cannot leave this cursed place for the time being, and there are no enemies here. So we thought, Senior Sister, you wouldn't have any use for those Demonic Beasts, would you?"

Zi Mo's face turned icy, "You want my Demonic Beasts?"

"Exactly!" Yao He nodded, "Xie'er and I are just a step away from breaking through. We are somewhat reluctant to kill our own Demonic Beasts, so we hope Senior Sister can contribute a few."

Zi Mo's heart ached, "Is this the reason you would even destroy a thread of my soul?"

Yao Xi giggled, "Who told you to hide? If you hadn't hidden, we wouldn't have done this. Now that we are stuck here with little fun, we originally wanted to have a hunting competition with your Demonic Beasts, but it seems heaven does not fulfill our wishes; you forced us into this."

"Fine!" Zi Mo's expression turned pained, a hint of resolution in her eyes, "You want my Demonic Beasts? Take them all!"

Yao He laughed heartily, "I knew Senior Sister would be easy to talk to. Please order them not to resist; otherwise, if it comes to a fight, it might not end well!"

Zi Mo closed her eyes, her chest rising and falling.

Although she had already reclaimed the threads of her soul from the Control Soul Insects taken by the two since arriving here, and no longer needed to worry about Yao He and Yao Xi destroying her soul threads, they still held overwhelming advantages. Not to mention the numerous Demonic Beasts they controlled, even the dozen or so Great Han martial artists under control represented a formidable fighting force.

If it came to a real fight, Zi Mo had no chance of winning. Even breaking out would be nearly impossible, so despite her unwillingness, she had no choice but to temporarily compromise.

Fixating on Zi Mo's towering peaks, Yao He’s eyes gleamed with a hidden lust as he unconsciously licked his lips.

"Alright!" Zi Mo opened her eyes and said expressionlessly.

Yao He and Yao Xi exchanged glances, silently issuing commands.

In an instant, the wails of countless Demonic Beasts echoed, blood splattering everywhere as one after another, the Demonic Beasts that offered no resistance were brought down, their necks bitten through by their kin, dying on the spot.

The group of Great Han martial artists looked horrified, their hearts racing.

In just a few breaths, thirty to forty Demonic Beasts were killed.

"Hahahaha!" Yao He laughed loudly.

With thirty to forty blood beads, one of them could break through to the Fifth Stage of the True Yuan Realm.

As for the rest, once they extracted the secrets of the Great Han martial artists, they could slaughter them all, and at that time, they would have another substantial number of blood beads.

What particularly excited Yao He were the several beauties among the Great Han, each of them stunning and alluring. Over these days, he had tried various ways to get close to them, but Yao Xi kept a tight watch, never leaving his side, making it impossible for him to find an opportunity.

Though they were cousins, their relationship was far from simple...

He needed to think of a way to distract his cousin, then he could indulge himself freely. Yao He glanced at Han Xiao Qi and the others, swallowing hard.

Yes, let her use these blood beads for now; it would take her some time to refine and absorb them to break through to the Fifth Stage of the True Yuan Realm. That time would be enough for him to act recklessly.

The more Yao He thought about it, the more excited he became, wishing he could immediately embrace the beauties of the Great Han, indulging in them and savoring that bone-corroding pleasure.
