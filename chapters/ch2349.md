## Chapter 2349 — Future Plans

In a side room, Yang Kai sat in a circle with Chi Yue and the others, listening as they recounted all that had happened over the past few months.

In truth, there wasn’t much to say. Ever since that day when Qiu Ze brought people to Chiyue Sect to cause trouble—only to have his entire force wiped out—this shocking news spread like wildfire. The sects that suffered heavy losses were all left anxious and uneasy. A few days later, these sects sent people to seek peace, pushing all the blame onto those who had died, claiming they knew nothing about what had happened.

Of course, this was nonsense. Not even a fool would believe such excuses.

However, these sects all brought generous supplies, saying it was to compensate Chiyue Sect for their losses in that battle, and also expressing their desire to submit. Ye Hen did not pursue them to the bitter end.

In the past, Chiyue Sect would never have had the strength or confidence to subdue these sects, but now that the Heavenly Puppets had appeared, it was as if there were several Emperor Realm experts stationed in the sect at all times. Who in a million li radius would dare provoke them?

Ye Hen agreed to their request to submit to Chiyue Sect and sent them back.

In other words, now within a million li, Chiyue Sect was the sole overlord! It was easy to imagine that after occupying such a vast territory, Chiyue Sect’s development would surely flourish.

“Did people from Tianzhao Palace come as well?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Chi Yue replied, “They did. The Third Elder of Tianzhao Palace came in person, bringing many gifts, afraid that Sect Master Ye would wipe them out.”

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “Was Qiu Yu willing? Qiu Ze was his father, and he died in Chiyue Sect. Qiu Yu probably won’t let this go easily, will he?”

Ghost Ancestor said, “What if he’s unwilling? To curry favor with Chiyue Sect, Tianzhao Palace has already expelled Qiu Yu and crippled his cultivation. Now he’s no longer the Young Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace, just a man waiting to die.”

Yang Kai sneered, “This Third Elder of Tianzhao Palace is truly ruthless!”

Yang Kai didn’t know who this Third Elder was, but he guessed the man was afraid Qiu Yu would seek revenge in the future, so he simply crippled Qiu Yu’s cultivation and expelled him from Tianzhao Palace.

There was nothing wrong with this. If he wanted to protect Tianzhao Palace, he could only show weakness to Chiyue Sect. Qiu Yu was Qiu Ze’s only son, and with his father dead at Chiyue Sect, of course he would want revenge.

Thinking back to a few months ago, Qiu Yu was still riding high, but now, after just a few months, he had become a stray dog. Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh—on the path of cultivation, a single misstep could lead to eternal damnation!

If Qiu Ze and the others hadn’t been so aggressive, how would those sects have ended up like this?

“Yang boy, there’s something we want to discuss with you,” Ai Ou suddenly said.

“What is it?” Yang Kai looked at them in confusion.

Chi Yue and the others exchanged glances. Gu Cangyun said, “Eldest Brother, you speak.”

Ghost Ancestor nodded and said, “It’s like this. The few of us discussed it and want to join Chiyue Sect. We wonder what the Sect Master thinks.”

“You want to join Chiyue Sect?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Ghost Ancestor said, “That’s right. Sect Master Ye mentioned this to us before, but since you hadn’t come out of seclusion, we didn’t agree. We just wanted to hear your opinion.”

Yang Kai turned to look at them and asked, “Are you truly willing to join?”

Chi Yue gave a bitter smile and said, “Since we entered the Star Realm, we’ve suffered all kinds of hardships. We’d thought about joining a sect before, but we had neither strength nor connections, so we couldn’t get in. Now that Sect Master Ye has personally invited us, we don’t want to miss this chance.”

Gu Cangyun said, “Sect Master Yang, you haven’t joined a sect either, so you should know how hard it is to cultivate alone.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded. His journey had been smooth, but he did lack the conveniences of a sect disciple. It was reasonable for Chi Yue and the others to want to join Chiyue Sect. After thinking for a moment, he said, “It’s a good thing. Sect Master Ye’s personal invitation shows his sincerity. Since you’re all willing, it’s fine to stay.”

He had been considering how to arrange things for Ghost Ancestor and the others in the future.

He’d thought about taking them to Qingyang Shrine, but he wasn’t an important figure there, and it would be inappropriate to ask Wen Zishan to take them in.

Even though Yang Kai knew that if he asked, Wen Zishan would not refuse, joining Qingyang Shrine through the back door would surely draw scorn. Qingyang Shrine was no small sect.

Ye Hen’s invitation had come as a surprise.

Chiyue Sect was now in a period of recovery and needed people, and its future was bright. For Chi Yue and the others, staying here was not a bad choice.

Just by repairing the secret realm entrance and bringing back the lost techniques and secret arts, Ye Hen would never mistreat these friends of his.

“You agreed?” Chi Yue asked.

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “This is a matter for you seniors to decide—why would I object?”

“And you? Where are you going?” Ai Ou asked, looking at him.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and said, “I want to look for Xiaoxiao.”

Of the companions who came from the Star Domain, aside from the fallen Wudao, all the others had been found—only Xiaoxiao was still missing. Yang Kai was very worried. Until he found him, he wouldn’t be at ease.

“How will you search?” Chi Yue frowned slightly.

“I don’t know. I might go to Netherworld Sect and look for Yin Lesheng. Maybe he knows something.”

When they came out of the Starlight Passage, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun from the Great Wilderness Star Domain landed near Biyu Sect and were forced to join it. Chi Yue and the others landed near Tianhe City. Judging from this, Xiaoxiao might have ended up with Yin Lesheng, who was also from the Great Wilderness Star Domain.

If he could find Yin Lesheng, maybe he could find clues about Xiaoxiao.

He remembered Yin Lesheng saying he was a disciple of Netherworld Sect. There was a Netherworld Sect in the Great Wilderness Star Domain, and also one in the Star Realm. But Yang Kai didn’t know where the one in the Star Realm was, so he’d have to investigate.

“You must be careful. Qingluo and the others are still waiting for you!” Chi Yue warned gravely. They had also met Yin Lesheng and knew that Netherworld Sect was no small sect in the Star Realm. Yang Kai and Yin Lesheng had become enemies in the Starlight Passage. If they met again, Yin Lesheng would not let it go. Moreover, Yin Lesheng knew Yang Kai was a Star Lord and wanted to seize his Stellar Origin.

Stellar Origin was a rare thing in the Star Realm, able to help cultivators comprehend Law Power. Everyone coveted it.

“I understand,” Yang Kai smiled. “For their sake, I won’t take reckless risks.”

After that, Yang Kai took out all the Spiritual Pills he had refined recently and gave them to Chi Yue and the others, along with a large amount of Source Crystals.

These were exactly what Chi Yue and the others needed. Even though they knew Yang Kai was doing well, seeing him take out so many Spiritual Pills and Source Crystals still shocked them.

Thinking back to a year ago, they had to risk their lives in dangerous places to hunt Demonic Beasts for Source Crystals, then use those to buy Origin Condensing Pills. Even so, they could only buy a few dozen at a time.

Those few dozen Origin Condensing Pills had to be split among several people, so each person got less than ten, which would be used up in a few days. Then they’d have to go out and hunt Demonic Beasts again, over and over!

But now, the number of Origin Condensing Pills Yang Kai took out was in the thousands!

Such a huge amount of Spiritual Pills was enough for them to convert all their strength into Origin Qi.

There were also all kinds of marvelous Spiritual Pills for cultivation, many of which had developed Pill Patterns.

Chai Hu was especially shocked, only now realizing how high Yang Kai’s alchemy skills were.

An hour later, Yang Kai went to visit Ye Hen.

Ye Hen seemed to be in seclusion, but upon hearing that Yang Kai had come, he happily came out to greet him.

After they sat down, Ye Hen quickly said, “I should have come to visit Young Master Yang, but you came yourself. I’ve been discourteous.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Sect Master Ye is too polite.”

After ordering tea to be served, Ye Hen asked, “May I ask if there’s something Young Master Yang needs from me?”

Even though Chiyue Sect was now the local overlord and Ye Hen’s status had risen, he hadn’t become arrogant. In front of Yang Kai, he still maintained his humble demeanor.

Seeing this, Yang Kai knew Ye Hen was not the type to forget favors and betray friends, so he was completely at ease with Chi Yue and the others staying here.

“I wouldn’t dare give orders. It’s just that my seniors told me they want to stay in Chiyue Sect, so I came to ask Sect Master Ye to look after them in the future,” Yang Kai said warmly.

Ye Hen laughed heartily, “Young Master Yang, you’re being too distant. Chiyue Sect was able to come back from the brink of destruction all thanks to you. Never mind looking after them—if you wanted my position as Sect Master, I wouldn’t even frown.”

This old fellow was still thinking about marrying him into the sect?

Yang Kai grumbled inwardly and waved his hand, “I won’t be staying. I still have things to do.”

Ye Hen didn’t react much to this. Perhaps his earlier words were just a final test. He laughed heartily, “Then I won’t say more. I just hope Young Master Yang will visit Chiyue Sect often when you have time. We will always welcome you.”

With Chi Yue and the others staying here, Yang Kai would surely visit. Yang Kai’s potential was immense, so maintaining a good relationship with him was only wise.

Though Ye Hen was old, his vision was sharp. He naturally understood this.

“Of course,” Yang Kai smiled, then changed the subject, “Last time, Sect Master Ye said that if you had ten years, you could reach Emperor Realm?”

Ye Hen’s expression turned serious, “Last time, I misspoke.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai was surprised.

Ye Hen said proudly, “If I have another five years, I can reach Emperor Realm! The techniques and secret arts left by Ancestor Ye Chong are extremely effective for me. The more I comprehend them, the more I gain. If I can fully understand them, I might not even need five years. It’s just a pity...” At this, he sighed, “I don’t know if this old body can last that long.”
