## Chapter 2506 — Ziyue Desert

Duan Hongchen snorted, "Do you think the title of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was given for nothing? If we miss this chance, we may never have another opportunity to kill him."

As soon as he finished speaking, he burst out laughing, "No one in this world can kill this Lord!"

Duan Hongchen's two tones made him seem as if suffering from a split personality.

Yang Kai snorted, "Shut up!"

Duan Hongchen turned his head, glaring coldly at Yang Kai, and said in a chilling voice, "Brat, say that again if you dare. Do you believe I won't..."

Yang Kai waved his hand to cut him off, "Alright, alright, enough with the threats. I just advanced to the Emperor Realm and already made you suffer. When I become a Great Emperor one day, wiping you out will be as easy as spitting. Hurry up and let Senior Duan speak."

"You..." Wu Kuang managed to utter a single word before Duan Hongchen seized control of the body again. With a helpless sigh, he said, "Kid, as you can see, my body now holds not only my own Divine Soul, but also that old scoundrel Wu Kuang's. I can't even self-destruct anymore, nor can I drive him out. From now on, I'm neither truly alive nor dead—what's the point of living like this?"

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat at this, quickly trying to comfort him, "Senior, don’t be so discouraged. Everything in life has its own balance. Since Heaven arranged things this way, there must be a reason behind it."

"What reason? Tell me, if there really is one, I won't blame you for saving my life."

Yang Kai felt bitter. How could he have known saving someone would cause so much trouble? He was just trying to comfort Duan Hongchen, not actually explain anything. But after a moment's thought, he said, "Senior Duan, think about it. Now that Wu Kuang's Divine Soul is in your body, it brings you many inconveniences, but on the other hand, you can monitor him at any time. With you watching, Wu Kuang can't stir up any trouble, and he won't be able to threaten the Star Realm again."

Duan Hongchen's eyes lit up at these words, and he nodded with a smile, "That's right. That's exactly it."

Yang Kai laughed, "Since you two seniors will have to share a body from now on, you should get along. Come, come, shake hands. Be good friends from now on!"

Duan Hongchen snorted, "Friends? That's impossible. If I get the chance, I'll still self-destruct. Wu Kuang, you'd better be careful. Don't ever let your guard down."

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat again, not knowing what Wu Kuang, hiding inside Duan Hongchen, thought of all this.

It was no easy feat to seize half a body and preserve his Divine Soul, but now he had to stay constantly on guard against the original owner self-destructing. Just thinking about it was exhausting.

"Alright, since things here are settled, let's return to the Shattered Star Sea," Yang Kai said, standing up.

Duan Hongchen shook his head, "I'm afraid we can't go back to the Shattered Star Sea."

"Why?" Yang Kai looked at him in surprise.

Duan Hongchen said, "Wu Kuang's hiding place was at the very core of the Shattered Star Sea. When I fought him, we destroyed that place, and the Shattered Star Sea collapsed at the same time."

Yang Kai was shocked and cried out, "The Shattered Star Sea collapsed? What about the people inside?"

Although Liu Yan, Zhang Ruoxi, and Mo Xiaoqi had been taken into the Small Xuan Realm, Hua Qingsi was still in the Shattered Star Sea, as were Xia Sheng, Murong Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Baiyi, not to mention thousands of elite disciples from the four territories of the Star Realm. If all these people perished because of the collapse, the Star Realm would suffer a huge loss and wouldn't recover for a hundred years.

Duan Hongchen said, "There's no need to worry about that. When the Shattered Star Sea collapsed, they were all expelled. So their lives aren't in danger."

Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief, "That's good."

"But from now on, there will be no more Shattered Star Sea. The world's cultivators have lost a place to temper themselves," Duan Hongchen said with some regret. Although the Shattered Star Sea had always hidden the extremely dangerous Wu Kuang, who could bring disaster to the Star Realm at any moment, it couldn't be denied that its existence had produced many Emperor Realm cultivators for the Star Realm.

Just look at what happened in the Shattered Star Sea this time. Many cultivators with deep foundations and outstanding talent have already broken through to the Emperor Realm, and even those who didn’t manage it within the Shattered Star Sea may well succeed after returning to their sects and entering secluded cultivation for a while.

It's easy to imagine that in the next ten, fifty, or even a hundred years, Emperor Realm cultivators will spring up like bamboo shoots after the rain.

In fact, every time the Shattered Star Sea opened, the following century would see a wave of new Emperor Realm cultivators emerging.

"That's just how it is," Yang Kai smiled slightly. "There are gains and losses in everything. Solving the hidden threat of Wu Kuang is worth the loss of the Shattered Star Sea."

Duan Hongchen looked at him, "You're right."

As he spoke, he slowly stood up, "Alright, let's leave this place. Let me see... This is a Void Passage. To get out, we need to find a weak spot in the space barrier..."

Suddenly, he stopped, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment. Yang Kai's body was rippling with strange power. He swung his hand forward, and a crack appeared out of nowhere.

Duan Hongchen’s jaw dropped, his eyes shining with disbelief. “You’ve mastered the Power of Space?” He was already stunned by Yang Kai’s earlier display, but never imagined he’d be skilled in such a rare and mysterious art. If not for his command of space, how could Yang Kai tear open the Void Passage with a mere wave of his hand? Even for Duan Hongchen himself, escaping this place would require first finding a weak spot in the space barrier, then blasting it open with brute force—carefully, lest the passage collapse and trap him in the void forever.

Yang Kai grinned, "Just a minor trick. Sorry to show off in front of you, Senior."

Duan Hongchen's mouth twitched, "Unbelievable, unbelievable. Young people these days are truly remarkable."

As soon as he finished, he shouted angrily, "Duan Hongchen, if you hadn't interfered, this Lord would have seized this boy's body. Such a fine vessel—I'll never find another like it!"

Yang Kai's face darkened. Even knowing it was Wu Kuang speaking, he still wasn't used to someone changing faces so quickly. He gestured, "Senior Duan, after you."

Duan Hongchen nodded slightly and was the first to step through the crack, quickly disappearing. Only after he left did Yang Kai follow at a leisurely pace.

Stepping out of the crack, a desolate scene unfolded before his eyes.

Looking around, he found himself in a desert. The ground was covered in rolling yellow sand, stretching as far as the eye could see. The wind howled, clouds billowed, and visibility was almost zero beyond ten zhang.

Duan Hongchen, who had come out before Yang Kai, was also looking around. Yang Kai walked up beside him, shading his eyes with his hand, and asked, "Senior Duan, where are we?"

He was certain this was the Star Realm. In other words, after leaving the Void Passage, he had returned to the Star Realm.

But this was definitely not the Northern Territory where he had entered the Shattered Star Sea. The Northern Territory was icy and snowy, and could never look like this.

Duan Hongchen pondered for a moment, then said, "This should be the Ziyue Desert in the Eastern Territory."

"Eastern Territory?" Yang Kai's eyes lit up.

He had planned to go to the Eastern Territory after finishing things in the Shattered Star Sea, to search for Xiaoxiao. After all, he had learned some news about Xiaoxiao from Yin Lesheng.

The Eastern Territory was far away and full of dangers. He had thought to find a large city or sect and use their Space Array, but by a twist of fate, he had arrived in the Eastern Territory directly.

This was truly a pleasant surprise.

"You have business in the Eastern Territory?" Duan Hongchen asked, glancing at Yang Kai curiously.

Yang Kai smiled, "Just some personal matters."

Duan Hongchen didn't ask further. He nodded, "In that case, I'll part ways with you here. When you travel the Star Realm in the future, remember to act upright and have a clear conscience!"

Yang Kai replied solemnly, "I will remember your teachings, Senior."

After speaking, he asked, "Senior, aren't you going back to Qingyang Shrine?"

Duan Hongchen shook his head, "In my current state, it's not suitable to go where there are many people. I won't go. If you see Wen Zishan in the future, don't mention me to him, so he won't worry."

Yang Kai said, "Understood."

Duan Hongchen nodded, and with a flicker, quickly disappeared into the endless yellow sand.

Watching him leave, Yang Kai sighed softly.

Duan Hongchen was clearly uneasy about Wu Kuang's Divine Soul inside him, which was why he was so eager to part ways and didn't dare go to crowded places. Who knows what he'll do in the future? Now that he and Wu Kuang share a body, there will surely be many troubles. Fortunately, he can't even self-destruct now. If there's a chance in the future, perhaps Wu Kuang's Divine Soul can be expelled from his body.

But that will require tremendous strength.

After a while, Yang Kai summoned his wooden boat and sped away.

Half a day later, Yang Kai left the endless yellow sand behind, and a patch of green appeared before his eyes.

As he flew closer, he realized it was a tiny oasis.

In the desert, oases are extremely rare. Such a small place can bring hope and life to those lost in the sands. There were traces of human activity, but no one was around now—it seemed no one had been here for a long time.

Yang Kai landed, found a relatively clean spot, sat down, and then entered the Small Xuan Realm.

When he was advancing to the Emperor Realm earlier, he had to draw a thread of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth from the Xuan Realm Pearl to withstand the power that descended from the heavens. He didn't know if this had damaged the Small Xuan Realm.

After his advancement, he hadn't had time to check. Only now did he finally have a chance.
