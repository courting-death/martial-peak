## Chapter 1664 — Qiantian Thunderflame

Yang Kai stood with the Dragon Bone sword in hand; a dense pressure seemed to emanate from the blade like a material reality, as if a peak ten thousand zhang high were pressing down on the two elders from the Fire Radiance Sect, turning their faces grim.

A dragon's roar and furious howling could still be faintly heard at their ears.

"One each, finish them quickly; I'll wait ahead," Yang Kai said casually, then waved and released the Stone Puppet and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

He didn't spare the two elders a glance and strode forward.

With a single step he seemed to cross the barrier of space itself; his figure vanished and when it reappeared he was already halfway up the mountain.

"How dare you!" The thin elder's face went sullen; Yang Kai's indifferent demeanor inflamed his rage, and his form flickered as he tried to give chase.

But no sooner had he moved than a jet-black staff silhouette hurtled at him, its force weighty and oppressive, as if several hundred thousand jin of brute power were striking down, even the air exploding and humming from the impact.

The shrill sound sent pain stabbing through the elder's eardrums.

The thin elder's expression darkened; he hastily raised his hand to block, and blazing flames ran up his arm.

Boom……

The blazing flames were extinguished; the thin elder's body seemed struck by thunder, his form drifting back dozens of zhang before he could barely steady himself, his face paling and a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.

With a single blow, he had suffered a minor wound.

Staring forward in disbelief, the thin elder saw only a stone puppet less than three chi tall standing there, a black staff balanced on its shoulder; its eyes, like black beans, shimmered with an indescribable spirit as it watched him with the look of a predator sizing up prey.

On the other side, a clear birdcall sounded; the dark-red-skinned elder had already become entangled with the Fire Bird, man and bird tumbling and soaring in the sky, their struggle kicking up sprays of flame into the void in a scene of extreme tumult.

"What the hell are these things?" the thin elder was stunned.

He could vaguely tell the creature fighting his companion was some sort of Artifact Spirit, but what on earth was that stone puppet standing before him?

It gave off no trace of energy fluctuation from within, yet its sheer savage strength made him deeply apprehensive.

"Aooooh..." The Stone Puppet suddenly howled to the sky, one of its fists hammering and battering its own chest in rapid succession with a thudding boom, like a tight war drum shaking the heart.

With the sound, the stone puppet, originally under three chi tall, visibly swelled and directly became a stone giant five zhang tall!

The black staff across its shoulder lengthened as its body expanded.

A layer of scorching dark-red radiance flowed over its surface; the Stone Puppet's exterior instantly looked as if it had donned a suit of molten-lava armor.

The crimson armor radiated a terrifying energy that made the elder's heart quake.

In the next moment the magma-armored giant bent its knees slightly and then, like an arrow loosed from a bow, its massive body shot forward and the ground shook; the earth instantly split into a huge pit.

The world blurred and the thin elder found, to his horror, that the transformed magma giant had already leapt over him; its enormous black staff, with thunderous force, swept toward him and ripped a seam through the very fabric of space.

Realizing the terrifying power contained in the blow, the thin elder uttered a cry of panic and dared not meet it; he hastily used his body technique to dodge.

But though he dodged swiftly, the incoming attack was even faster.

Even the lingering force numbed half his body; his Saint Yuan nearly failed to circulate.

Unstoppable! Impossible to withstand!

The thin elder's eyes trembled violently; in an instant he realized the gap between himself and this magma giant.

Before his thought could finish, the black great-staff again descended from above like Mount Tai bearing down.

The gaunt elder’s eyelids twitched sharply, his pupils shrinking to the size of needlepoints. Desperately, he poured all his Saint Yuan into action, shouting aloud as he summoned a shield-like Secret Treasure to guard above his head.

Boom boom……

The great staff struck; the shield Secret Treasure flashed brilliantly but in an instant shattered into countless fragments that sprayed in all directions.

The world-shattering force slammed into the thin elder, pulverizing half his body into mince; the wound was a mass of mangled flesh, with visible writhing entrails.

Even with such injuries, the thin elder did not die immediately; with sufficiently fine Spiritual Pills he might even restore his body.

But the fear swelling from the depths of his heart left him utterly bereft of fighting will.

He stared blankly at the black great-staff that had swept him, a single thought flashing through his mind.

What the hell are these damned things…

At the end of his life, the last thing he saw was his companion being swallowed whole by the Fire Bird, screams of agony filling the air!

The great staff swept through, flesh flying, and the whole world fell silent.

A mass of thunderfire leapt from the corpse behind the thin elder; the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird opened its great maw and, like a whale sucking in water, drew that thunderfire into its belly with a satisfied cry.

At the volcano's summit, Yang Kai hovered in midair, looking down at the grotesque crater; within he could clearly see the boiling scarlet magma.

The heat emanating from the peak was such that even ordinary Origin Returning Realm practitioners would find it unbearable; any below Origin Returning Realm who came here would be burned to death instantly.

The Artifact Spirit flew to Yang Kai's side; the Stone Puppet reverted to its harmless shape, shoulder-hoisting the Heaven-Shaking Pillar and sitting atop the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

"That was quick — you lot are a little too violent, aren't you?" Yang Kai grinned.

The Stone Puppet scratched its head, looking as if unsure whether it had done something wrong, while the Artifact Spirit chirped happily.

"Little one, come back now." Yang Kai reached out and summoned the Stone Puppet away, leaving only the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

The Fire Bird circled Yang Kai, emitting clear, frequent calls; it seemed highly excited and several times tried to charge straight into the volcanic mouth.

In response to its calls, a thudding echoed from within the volcano as if answering the Fire Bird's provocations, showing no sign of weakness.

"You feel it too, right?" Yang Kai squinted at the crater and smiled.

The Fire Bird replied with urgent cries.

"Is it the opponent you were looking for?" Yang Kai asked again.

The Fire Bird fell silent a moment, then let out an even clearer, more resounding call.

"Alright, then I'll watch with interest. But if you're really going to do this, it's a do-or-die move — failure means death!"

The Fire Bird responded again with a sonorous cry.

"I understand. Well... good luck then." Yang Kai's expression grew grave as he nodded, then waved his hand. A massive forging furnace appeared.

This was the refining furnace that birthed the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, brought out by Yang Kai from the Flowing Flame Sandland's Fifth Layer's Earth Lung Fire Vein.

It was the vessel of the Fire Bird!

If the refining furnace were destroyed, the Fire Bird would perish with it — no doubt about that.

Since obtaining the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, Yang Kai had seldom used this refining furnace, partly to keep the Artifact Spirit safe and partly because it was unnecessary.

But this time the furnace had to be used.

With this vessel the Artifact Spirit's strength could be boosted by at least two tenths.

As soon as the refining furnace appeared, the Fire Bird opened its huge beak and swallowed it into its belly.

Yang Kai closed his eyes and took a deep breath; when he opened them again his left eye flashed with a sheet of golden light.

The World-Ending Demon Eye!

That vertical golden pupil seemed to contain endless majesty that made one's skin crawl.

He looked down; everything that had been unseen before now lay exposed beneath his eyelids.

The World-Ending Demon Eye has the power to see through all illusions; with its aid Yang Kai immediately discovered a huge formation sealing the volcanic mouth.

Pure streams of energy formed shackles in an octagonal shape, locking the entire crater.

This formation not only sealed the flow of energy within the volcano but also bound the freedom of the being hiding inside the volcano.

Yang Kai watched carefully; after a moment his eyes shot with killing light, he lightly twirled the Dragon Bone sword and poured Saint Yuan into the blade.

The dragon's roar shook the sky.

"Go!" Yang Kai hurled the Dragon Bone sword.

A green radiance dazzled; the Dragon Bone sword became a jade-green giant dragon, thrashing and striking at a point in the void.

The octagonal formation that sealed the crater trembled and suddenly split open a gap.

Unbearable scalding breath immediately poured out from that gap, almost burning heaven and earth.

"In!" Yang Kai shouted.

The Artifact Spirit Fire Bird turned into a streak of light and rushed through the gap, Yang Kai close behind.

The octagonal formation wavered and quickly mended itself, continuing to seal the giant crater.

Inside the formation Yang Kai's face altered; he quickly circulated Saint Yuan to resist the all-pervading heat.

The Fire Bird had already shot into the volcanic mouth.

Looking in, the magma rolled; within the scarlet lava faint threads of blue electricity slithered like silver snakes, and, stirred by the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, a chilling aura was slowly reviving as if a slumbering great dragon were awakening.

The Artifact Spirit plunged into the magma and vanished.

After a moment, a staggering will suddenly burst forth, conveying a message that all living things should submit.

“A mere acquired Artifact Spirit dares to challenge my majesty? Ignorant ant, tremble beneath my might!”

Yang Kai's body trembled; his gaze stared in astonishment downward as if piercing the thick magma to peer into the depths.

The rumors were true: the Fire Radiance Sect's Qiantian Thunderflame had indeed developed sentience, and... its intelligence was not low; it was clearer and more complete than the Fire Bird.

It could already clearly express its meaning, whereas the Fire Bird evidently could not yet do so.

Yang Kai grew suddenly concerned for the Fire Bird's situation.

Before coming here he had not expected Qiantian Thunderflame to have evolved to this degree; he had thought it roughly on par with the Fire Bird, but it seemed the Qiantian Thunderflame was decidedly superior.

From below the volcanic mouth came the clash of astonishing wills — the battle between the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit and the Qiantian Thunderflame — and the profound intents they gave off threw the Fire Radiance Sect's spiritual qi into chaos.
