## Chapter 638 — Targeted

After those Transcendent Realm masters struck, in less than three breaths' time over a dozen martial artists tried to avoid it and died miserably on the spot.

Moreover, as those attackers increased the ferocity of their blows, the jade-green gas seeping from the Coffin-Bearer’s body kept swelling, becoming more and more intense!

Screams of agony rose one after another; the martial artists who a moment ago had been full of excitement now all used their body techniques to distance themselves, crying as they fled in every direction.

Ji Yan waved a great hand, and a surge of refined True Yuan wrapped Yang Kai and the others, swiftly retreating a hundred zhang up into the air, where he looked down coldly and snorted, “Foolish! Do you truly think there is no danger simply because the Coffin-Bearer does not act?”

He clearly understood what sort of upheaval would occur once the Coffin-Bearer was attacked to a certain degree, knowledge not everyone possessed.

Xu Qi, Zou Xing and Yao Di did not stop because of those deaths; the lives of those people mattered not at all to them, and they continued their relentless assault, causing the spread of the jade-green gas to grow ever larger and fiercer.

Very quickly, centered on the Coffin-Bearer, the surrounding several li were filled with that jade-green hue.

Yang Kai swiftly grasped the cruelty of this world: for these exalted strong ones, to achieve their ends they simply did not care about the lives of others.

More martial artists were swallowed by the jade-green gas and met their ends within it; many others, sensing dire danger, began to retreat—just like Ji Yan—soaring up into the high air.

The dozens of powerful cultivators struck with even greater intensity, single-mindedly bombarding the Coffin-Bearer.

“Soon, right?” Zou Xing released attacks while staring fixedly at the Coffin-Bearer below, murmuring with an expectant look on his face.

“It should be soon.” Yao Di nodded slightly, watching intently.

Sure enough, the Coffin-Bearer underneath seemed to have endured too much harm and finally showed another movement; his two unusually muscular hands slowly raised, and a thunderous sound rumbled from his mouth, slow and deafening: “Take it… take it…”

It sounded like a helpless roar and like a low lament, causing one's heart to tremble.

In the sky, mysterious runes and formation patterns suddenly appeared, flowing with radiant light; these sigils were intricate and profound, and no one could make out what they signified.

Yet as those runes manifested, the eyes of the Transcendent Realm experts flashed with light; they stared intently, as if trying to imprint the structure of the sigils into their minds so they could study them later.

Then the runes began to flicker, shooting forth energies from the void; many strange-shaped Secret Treasures, Pills and Martial Skill manuals appeared out of nowhere.

These treasures, pills and Martial Skill manuals surged from the runes and radiated outward like blasts.

Seeing this, the fleeing martial artists were reinvigorated; they hastily used their body techniques and followed one of the beams of light in pursuit.

This was the Coffin-Bearer’s compensation for the places he damaged; though no one knew from where he summoned these items, many of them were reasonably high-quality pieces.

A few beams of light happened to fly toward Yang Kai and the others; the disciples of the Duao Alliance looked at Ji Yan with eager eyes, and Ji Yan, silent, merely inclined his head.

The disciples of the Duao Alliance were overjoyed and also rushed out, hoping to intercept those lights and see if they could snatch any gains.

Yang Kai watched indifferently, showing no intention of stealing anything, but Ruan Xinyu and Yun Xuan were a bit eager to try.

Faced with such suddenly appearing exotic treasures, few could remain unmoved; it was only natural they would be tempted.

Very quickly the exotic treasures summoned by the Coffin-Bearer were grabbed away in the scramble, but under the fierce attacks of the Transcendent Realm masters he waved his hand again and still shouted those two words, continuously summoning more items.

As before, many beams of light streaked over; this time Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu could not restrain themselves either, stepping beyond Ji Yan’s protective range and dashing toward one beam.

Yang Kai helplessly shook his head, released his Divine Sense, gathered his power, and intercepted slightly on their behalf.

Soon the two women caught those unknown treasures and flew back, faces full of joy.

“What did you get?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

“Seems like a Martial Skill manual—don’t know if it’s any good.” Yun Xuan flicked the item in her hand. “Things the Coffin-Bearer pulls out often are damaged and useless.”

“There are such things?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

“Mm, it seems the things he conjures are often rather old.” Yun Xuan smiled faintly.

As they spoke, Yang Kai suddenly felt that something was wrong. Frowning, he focused and looked down, and his heart lurched.

He discovered that within the jade-green gas the Coffin-Bearer was staring straight at him, and those bewildered eyes even showed a trace of excitement.

Everyone noticed the Coffin-Bearer’s abnormality; Xu Qi, Zou Xing and Yao Di stopped what they were doing and, following the Coffin-Bearer’s gaze, scrutinized Yang Kai with puzzled looks.

“Brother Zou, what does this mean?” Xu Qi frowned. “Why is he staring at that kid from the Duao Alliance?”

“I don’t know either. Does he have something special?” Zou Xing released his Divine Sense and swept it over Yang Kai, shaking his head in puzzlement.

He had not discovered anything unusual about Yang Kai.

Those beside Yang Kai in the sky also realized something was amiss.

Yun Xuan quietly asked, “Yang Kai, is he looking at you?”

“Probably!” Yang Kai nodded, an inexplicable chill running down his spine.

Being stared at by a mystifying Saint-Grade master of unclear mind and origin would unsettle anyone; Yang Kai was utterly bewildered—he did not know why the Coffin-Bearer had fixed on him, having at most only briefly used his Divine Sense moments earlier.

“Found… you…” the Coffin-Bearer still spoke in that exceedingly slow but steady cadence; as he spoke his grotesque maw split open, revealing irregular, saw-toothed teeth, as if laughing—a silent, horrifying smile.

The next moment the Coffin-Bearer’s aura changed abruptly; he slowly crouched his massive frame, bending his legs.

“What is he going to do?” someone cried out.

In legend, the Coffin-Bearer had never made such a movement; this sudden change left everyone utterly baffled.

“Stay away from me!” Yang Kai’s face darkened; at the instant the Coffin-Bearer moved he felt an overwhelming sense of being locked on, and he shouted, immediately employing his body technique to flee at top speed.

Whoosh…

The Coffin-Bearer also sprang from the ground like an arrow from a bow, moving so fast that Zou Xing and the others could hardly follow with their eyes.

In a moment the Coffin-Bearer had caught up to the fleeing Yang Kai, his grotesque maw split in a grin as he smiled at him, then with both hands flung open the Blood Coffin on his back, aiming it straight at Yang Kai’s body.

From within the Blood Coffin a violent pulling force suddenly issued forth, drawing at Yang Kai’s body and sucking him inward.

Yang Kai’s face went ashen; even exerting himself to the utmost he could not resist the power of the Blood Coffin.

Before he could form another thought, Yang Kai felt the world go black as he was drawn into the Blood Coffin.

Boom…

The Coffin-Bearer shut the Blood Coffin, hoisted it onto his back again, gave no one else even a glance, and vanished at the horizon as a streak of green light.

From the moment the upheaval began to Yang Kai being taken away, fewer than three breaths had passed; Zou Xing and the others had not even reacted before the Coffin-Bearer was gone.

Everyone stood frozen in place.

After a long stunned moment, Yun Xuan screamed and then streaked off in pursuit.

Ruan Xinyu grabbed her and scolded fiercely, “What do you think you’re doing?”

“Yang Kai—he—”

“I know he was taken, but can you catch up?” Ruan Xinyu barked.

Yun Xuan lost focus and turned, looking at Ji Yan with a tragic expression. “Uncle Ji…”

Ji Yan slowly shook his head.

On the other side, the dozens of experts were equally dumbfounded; after a long time Zou Xing finally asked, “Everyone, in the rumors have any of you heard of the Coffin-Bearer seizing someone?”

Most shook their heads, saying they had never heard; only Yao Di seemed thoughtful and said slowly, “I heard that ten years ago when the Coffin-Bearer first appeared, he also seized someone.”

“There was such a thing?” Zou Xing raised a brow. “Who did he seize?”

“Not sure who exactly; I only heard the rumor.”

“That’s odd…” Zou Xing was baffled, staring toward where the Coffin-Bearer had vanished and asking suspiciously, “Does that kid from the Duao Alliance have anything special about him?”

“That you should ask the people of the Duao Alliance.” Xu Qi glanced toward Ji Yan’s side.

After some thought, the group all hurried over to Ji Yan and began asking about Yang Kai’s situation.

Ji Yan knew nothing of Yang Kai either; though he was gloomy over the destruction of Blazing Fire City, he dared not offend these people, so he could only turn his gaze to Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu.

Yun Xuan looked utterly distraught and could provide no answers; Ruan Xinyu also did not know Yang Kai well enough to offer any clues.

The group was utterly bewildered.

“Sirs, the Coffin-Bearer took him—what will happen to him?” Yun Xuan suddenly asked.

Zou Xing slowly shook his head. “It’s hard to say; after all, this is the first time I’ve seen the Coffin-Bearer.”

Xu Qi pondered and said, “Although the Coffin-Bearer does not attack people directly, being near him is very dangerous; the death-scent and poison gas within him cannot be withstood even by ordinary Transcendent Realm practitioners, let alone those of the Divine Roaming Realm—this kid’s prospects are grim.”

Yun Xuan’s face went pale.

“What is your relation to him?” Yao Di fixed Yun Xuan with a burning gaze.

“He… I’m just friends with him.” Yun Xuan looked miserable; at the thought that Yang Kai might be doomed she nearly burst into tears.

“Everyone, if convenient, you might come to our Duao City; we can discuss this matter more carefully.” Ji Yan thought it over and extended the invitation.

With Blazing Fire City destroyed, he needed to return to Duao City to report, and these people were powerful figures from various forces—using this incident to forge alliances would be beneficial in the future.

The others likewise wished to uncover Yang Kai’s secrets, so after a brief discussion they all agreed and followed Ji Yan toward Duao City.
