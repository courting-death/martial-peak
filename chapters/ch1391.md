## Chapter 1391 — Several Parties Join Forces

In the blink of an eye more than twenty days had passed. On this day, a thousand li outside Tianyun City, two figures appeared — a burly man and a woman in a black robe: naturally Yang Kai and Yang Yan.

After emerging from the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Yan once again had the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle tear through the void, but although the distance remained the same this time, the direction was less than ideal, causing their return to take several more days than the outbound trip.

That mattered little; the Imperial Garden would not open for some time yet, so there was no rush.

Yang Kai suddenly understood another thing: why the Imperial Garden floated above Dragon Lair Mountain, placing Dragon Lair Mountain so close to Tianyun City. It was not chance, nor merely Dragon Lair Mountain’s luck — it was because Yang Yan had once been at Dragon Lair Mountain!

The Imperial Garden was the Great Emperor’s private estate, and with the Great Emperor herself slumbering within it there were countless subtle links to Yang Yan. Its hovering directly above Dragon Lair Mountain suddenly ceased to be mysterious.

Of course, this was only Yang Kai’s conjecture; he had not sought Yang Yan’s confirmation, but it was likely not far from the truth.

At that moment Yang Kai looked up as if sensing something and found the sky ahead flickering with all manner of colorful light; faintly he could feel intense energy fluctuations. Yang Yan froze, exchanged a startled glance with Yang Kai, then her face darkened.

From the look of it, some kind of struggle was taking place, and astonishingly the fighting was happening close to Dragon Lair Mountain.

Could it be that in the little over a month since the two of them left someone had dared to strike at Dragon Lair Mountain?

Thinking this, Yang Kai moved his Divine Sense and urged the Star Shuttle to race toward the scene at top speed. Yang Yan naturally followed close behind.

Yang Kai’s guess was correct — Dragon Lair Mountain was under siege, and at the head of the assault stood the Xie Family, a clan that bore many grievances with Yang Kai.

Because Lu Ye had taken up residence in the Xie Family, Yang Kai had been entangled with many matters recently and had not found time to settle his enmity with the Xie Family. Unexpectedly, they had struck first.

Now, before Dragon Lair Mountain’s protective formation, a middle‑aged man in a purple robe stood with his hands behind his back, brows stormy, eyes full of authority, staring at the formation’s flashing lights with a rage that knew no bounds.

Xie Li! The Xie Family’s strongest expert, he had now reached the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. He held a respectable position in Yingyue Hall, but for this campaign he had even detached from Yingyue Hall to take revenge for the slain Xie Hongwen!

That Xie Hongwen died at Yang Kai’s hands was no secret, though none had exposed it openly. Before Xie Hongwen ventured into the Flowing Flame Sandland he had been rooted with a secret art: even if Yang Kai killed him without a trace, that secret art would have transferred to the killer.

Afterward, anyone from the Xie Family who investigated even slightly could identify the murderer.

Fortunately for Yang Kai he had Qian Tong as a powerful backer, which made Xie Li somewhat hesitant; he could not act rashly and had to wait for an opportunity.

The chance came quickly. When Qian Tong disappeared, Xie Li planned to take vengeance, so he secretly ordered his subordinates in Tianyun City to seize Dragon Lair Mountain’s Saint Crystals, detain its cultivators, and attempt to draw out Yang Kai.

The scheme had been flawless and executed perfectly—no one could have foreseen that Yang Kai’s strength would be so astonishing. He charged alone into Tianyun City and, under the watchful eyes of countless onlookers, slew a member of the Xie Family who was in the Origin Returning Realm. Afterwards, Fei Zhi Tu intervened, allowing Yang Kai to withdraw at ease.

Later, with Qian Tong returned safely, Xie Li, still resentful, had no choice but to pause his actions.

Unexpectedly, Qian Tong declared that the feud between the Xie Family and Dragon Lair Mountain was not a matter for Yingyue Hall, which elated Xie Li but also made him extremely wary, suspecting the old fox Qian Tong of a stratagem to lure his enemies out.

But after inquiries he discovered the astonishing truth: it had been Yang Kai himself who proposed the terms, and Qian Tong was only cooperating.

Seeking his own doom! Xie Li rejoiced — without Qian Tong’s backing and without Yingyue Hall’s support, how could a mere Dragon Lair Mountain withstand the Xie Family’s onslaught?

As far as he knew, Dragon Lair Mountain housed only two Origin Returning Realm cultivators, and they were only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators who had only broken through a few years prior.

Once, impatient to slake his vengeance, Xie Li had personally rushed to Dragon Lair Mountain to exterminate Yang Kai, but upon seeing the mountain’s protective formation he realized he had underestimated the place.

He could detect no flaw in that protective formation; multiple attempts to send clan disciples in to reconnoiter had failed to penetrate it, and those who entered had suffered greatly, nearly incurring casualties.

Xie Li had intended to hire formation masters from the Cai and Du families to break the formation, but to his surprise both clan leaders refused and even returned the offered payment.

After inquiries, Xie Li learned that Yang Kai had once saved Cai He of the Cai family and Du Sisi of the Du family; hearing that someone planned to attack Dragon Lair Mountain, the two had done their utmost to obstruct it. As rising youths of their clans they held some sway, and because of their interference the Cai and Du families rejected Xie Li’s invitation, which enraged him.

Fortunately, there were always paths to fortune. Dragon Lair Mountain, confident in the profundity of its protective formation, had grown arrogant and offended many: first the Haixin Sect of the Wuyou Sea, then Myriad Beasts Mountain, and the Demon Blood Sect.

In addition, Lu Ye of Liu Yun Valley had taken up residence in the Xie Family; according to the valley’s young master, his feud with Yang Kai was intense and bitter.

With several forces united, Xie Li’s confidence soared. Sensing that Dragon Lair Mountain was doomed this time, he gathered his clan’s elite, announced his detachment from Yingyue Hall, and began the assault.

The assembled masters numbered more than thirty Origin Returning Realm cultivators alone. Though none had reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and though Myriad Beasts Mountain and the Demon Blood Sect did not openly join but secretly sent some experts to assist, Xie Li was nonetheless satisfied.

In any case, Dragon Lair Mountain had no true masters within; its reliance was purely on the protective formation. Once that formation were shattered, those inside would be at their mercy.

Whenever he imagined Yang Kai kneeling before him and begging for mercy, Xie Li felt a flush of gratification.

There is no sorrow greater than an old head seeing the young one die; when he learned Xie Hongwen had died in the Flowing Flame Sandland, he had grieved terribly. Discovering Yang Kai to be the killer left Xie Li sleepless these years; Yang Kai had become nearly a demon haunting his soul.

Though no longer young, Xie Li’s violent temper had not mellowed with time.

He meant to avenge the slain and seize Dragon Lair Mountain’s riches. Over the years the mountain had displayed astonishing reserves; materials bought from Yingyue Hall alone totaled in the hundreds of millions of Saint Crystal.

Xie Li even suspected there might be rich Saint Crystal veins beneath Dragon Lair Mountain, for whence else would such abundance come?

If this assault succeeded, the lion’s share of the spoils would belong to the Xie Family. The Myriad Beasts Mountain and the Demon Blood Sect had already proclaimed they wanted only the piece of Xuan Gold in Yang Kai’s possession; as for who would take it, the two would discuss it among themselves and need not trouble the Xie Family.

With such terms, Xie Li agreed at once.

The condition proposed by Liu Yun Valley was stranger still: the valley’s young master, Lu Ye, demanded only Yang Kai’s corpse and nothing more.

What use was the corpse of a Saint King Realm cultivator? Xie Li did not understand, but he dared not probe further. Lu Ye made him uneasy; whenever Xie Li met that youth he felt a faint alarm, as if he faced not a Saint King Realm junior but a hidden snake baring its fangs.

Even more puzzling was that Lu Ye had gathered a dozen or so Origin Returning Realm cultivators under him, all First Stage cultivators. Liu Yun Valley was a minor force — it should not have so many Origin Returning Realm warriors.

Those Origin Returning Realm cultivators made Xie Li uneasy as well. Once when he chanced upon a conversation between several of them and Lu Ye, the men treated Lu Ye with extreme deference; their expressions held not only reverence but fear, as if servants facing the master who controlled their lives.

Such thoughts flashed through Xie Li’s mind and he shook his head to dismiss them, no longer indulging in wild speculation. He gave orders for the assembled forces to focus a mad bombardment on a certain spot of Dragon Lair Mountain’s protective formation.

If he could not hire a capable formation master to find a flaw, then a crude method would have to do.

He trusted that one day the formation would be broken.

Indeed, the thought pleased Xie Li. He longed to see the expression on Yang Kai’s face when the formation fell and Dragon Lair Mountain lay exposed, ready for them to trample and plunder.

Two days had passed since the attack began. In those two days the more than thirty Origin Returning Realm cultivators had been exhausted, let alone the Saint King Realm fighters; countless Saint Crystal and pills had been consumed to replenish Saint Yuan.

The protective formation proved far more resilient than Xie Li had imagined. After two days of fierce assault the light curtain had only dimmed slightly and had not been broken.

Inside Dragon Lair Mountain there was not the slightest counterattack, as if everyone within lay dead.

All manner of secret treasures flared with colorful lights and released tremendous power, one after another assaulting a certain part of the light curtain. While secretly alarmed, the attackers also panted with suppressed anger.

None had seen a formation so steadfast; to call it impregnable would be no exaggeration.

Suddenly, the mists behind the formation churned and several figures emerged.

Xie Li raised an eyebrow and lifted his hand to signal the others to cease. Everyone reined in their Secret Treasures and gazed calmly; two fair‑featured women stood side by side, and behind them were three elders whose auras marked them as First Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivators.
