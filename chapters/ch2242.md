## Chapter 2242 — Refining the Slave-Insect Bracelet

“Regarding the Soul-Devouring Worms, this Junior knows what he’s doing.” Yang Kai replied solemnly.

“That’s good.” Wen Zishan looked at him and said, “You don’t seem like someone who would act recklessly. If you need anything, just tell this Lord.”

“Many thanks, Hall Master Wen.”

Over the next two hours, Wen Zishan asked in detail about many matters within the Divine Roaming Mirror world. Yang Kai answered every question without reservation, hiding very little.

Two hours later, Yang Kai finally walked out of the main hall.

Gao Xueting seemed to have been waiting outside the whole time. When she saw him come out, she glanced at him and said coolly, “The Hall Master sent word that you need a secluded chamber?”

Yang Kai nodded, “Yes.”

Before leaving Wen Zishan, Yang Kai had indeed made this request, because he needed to refine the Slave-Insect Bracelet, and thus required a safe secret room.

Such a trivial matter was naturally agreed to by Wen Zishan without hesitation; he told Yang Kai directly that if he needed anything, he could simply seek out Gao Xueting.

“Come with me.” Gao Xueting said, turning and flying off.

Yang Kai followed closely behind.

Half an hour later, atop a mountain neither tall nor short, Gao Xueting landed. This peak, within the Qingyang Mountain Range, was not particularly imposing or majestic—rather ordinary, in fact. However, it was clearly reinforced by some kind of formation, so the Spiritual Qi here was richer than elsewhere.

There were no buildings on the peak, but vast stretches of purple bamboo could be seen, their color vibrant, and the environment was extremely elegant.

Gao Xueting led Yang Kai directly to a cave residence halfway up the mountain. She formed a seal with her hands and opened the restriction, saying, “This Purple Bamboo Peak is where I live. I usually stay in a cave residence higher up. If you need anything, just call out. I can come at any moment.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai felt a bit flattered and cupped his fists, “Many thanks, Elder Gao.”

He had only wanted Wen Zishan to casually arrange a quiet, safe chamber, but unexpectedly, Gao Xueting brought him to her own Purple Bamboo Peak and arranged for him to stay in a neighboring cave residence.

Clearly, she intended to look after him.

Gao Xueting nodded lightly and tossed Yang Kai a restriction token. “Go in yourself.”

Yang Kai took the token, swept it with his Divine Sense, thanked her again, and darted into the cave residence.

Looking around, the cave residence was neither large nor small, with several secret rooms available. Although no one had lived here for a long time, it was spotless, as if new. It must have been where Gao Xueting used to stay, though he didn’t know why she had moved.

With someone as powerful as Gao Xueting nearby, Yang Kai naturally felt completely at ease. This way, he could refine the Slave-Insect Bracelet without any worries.

Time was tight, so Yang Kai didn’t dare delay. He first familiarized himself with the restriction token, then activated all the cave residence’s restrictions, and finally sat cross-legged in a secret room to calm his mind.

Refining an Imperial Treasure was no simple matter.

Because Imperial Treasures are different from ordinary Secret Treasures—each one contains Emperor Intent and Imperial Aura. If one’s cultivation is insufficient, the Imperial Treasure may even backlash during refinement.

So, martial artists with insufficient cultivation always make sure to adjust themselves to their best state before refining an Imperial Treasure.

After three days, Yang Kai felt his mind, energy, and spirit had reached their peak. He took a deep breath and retrieved the long-forgotten Slave-Insect Bracelet from a corner of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Ever since he obtained the Slave-Insect Bracelet, he had never really studied it, nor had he ever thought to refine it.

It had only shown its worth twice, both times in moments of danger.

Once, years ago, when he and Xue Yue encountered a swarm of strange butterflies in the Lost Realm, the Slave-Insect Bracelet scared them off. The other time was beneath the ice valley of Biyu Sect, when he faced the Yao Worm Matriarch. If not for the Slave-Insect Bracelet intimidating the Yao Worm Matriarch, Yang Kai would never have subdued it.

Both times, the Slave-Insect Bracelet had saved Yang Kai’s life. Its merit was immense.

Now, although his cultivation was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, his Divine Sense had barely touched the Emperor Realm. Refining the Slave-Insect Bracelet should not be a problem.

Thinking this, he placed the palm-sized, bracelet-shaped Imperial Treasure in his hand, pressed his palms together to cover it, and simultaneously activated his Divine Sense and Origin Qi, pouring them in.

There was no reaction. The Slave-Insect Bracelet was like a piece of wood, refusing to accept any of his power.

Yang Kai was not anxious; this was within his expectations.

He slowly released his power, continually probing the Slave-Insect Bracelet, trying to open a gap in the Imperial Treasure and imprint his own mark upon it.

…

At Ten Thousand Saints Peak, dozens of li below, there was a pitch-black underground chamber. At this moment, inside, Granny You looked half-crazed. Though her cultivation was sealed by an invisible force, she still cursed incessantly.

“Wen Zishan, you little bastard, you little wretch, may you die a miserable death! Even if I become a vengeful ghost, I’ll never let you off!”

She seemed to have been cursing for quite a while, her voice hoarse, making her already unpleasant voice even harsher.

Suddenly, a voice rang out in the darkness.

“Granny, you keep repeating the same curses. How boring. My ears are getting calluses.”

Granny You’s curses paused for a moment, but soon she screamed hysterically, “Wen Zishan!”

“Heh!” The Hall Master smiled faintly and snapped his fingers. Suddenly, the space brightened a little. In the dim light, Granny You’s hair was disheveled, and she looked like a malicious ghost—utterly terrifying.

Wen Zishan acted as if he hadn’t noticed, instead looking at Granny You kindly, “Granny, tired from cursing? Take a break. I brought you something to eat, to moisten your throat!”

As he spoke, he really took out a plate of delicious, fragrant spirit fruits from his Spatial Ring. With a flick of his wrist, the plate floated to Granny You.

She glared at him viciously, her eyes bloodshot and full of endless hatred.

Perhaps she really did need to moisten her throat. After a moment’s silence, Granny You picked up the spirit fruits and began eating them in big mouthfuls.

Yet, as she ate, her venomous eyes never left Wen Zishan, and she chewed loudly. It was as if she were eating not spirit fruits, but Wen Zishan’s flesh.

In less than a quarter of an hour, Granny You had finished the spirit fruits.

“The little wretch didn’t poison the fruit?” Granny You wiped her mouth and looked at Wen Zishan with mockery.

The Hall Master put on a wounded expression, “Granny, we’ve known each other for centuries. Why do you always think the worst of me?”

“Hmph! It’s precisely because we’ve known each other for centuries that I can see right through your heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys!” Granny You retorted coldly.

Wen Zishan gave a bitter smile, “It seems you still have a lot of resentment toward me, Granny.”

“Resentment?” Granny You sneered, “You put it too simply. I don’t just resent you—I wish I could drink your blood, eat your flesh, and gnaw your bones!”

“I can see that.” Wen Zishan looked helpless. “Don’t make it sound so creepy…”

Suddenly, Granny You changed the subject, mocking, “How is that brat Yang now?”

Wen Zishan looked at her in surprise, “Granny, you can’t even protect yourself, yet you still care about others? I didn’t expect you to be so kind.”

“Don’t play dumb!” Granny You’s voice rose, “That brat has probably already been killed by you, hasn’t he?”

“Why would I kill him?” Wen Zishan curled his lip.

“Naturally, for the Warm Spirit Lotus!” Granny You said. “If you could get the Warm Spirit Lotus…”

“What if I did obtain the Warm Spirit Lotus?” This time, Wen Zishan cut her off before she could finish, saying, “I’ve already reached the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Beyond that is the realm of the Great Emperor. Do you really think that kind of boundary can be crossed with just the Warm Spirit Lotus? Or do you believe I should seize his Warm Spirit Lotus and walk the same path as you?”

Granny You stared coldly at Wen Zishan, “So you’ve talked with that brat in detail and know why I want the Warm Spirit Lotus.”

Wen Zishan nodded, speaking frankly, “Though I don’t want to admit it, I have to say, Granny, your idea is quite good. The Warm Spirit Lotus is a supreme treasure, indeed enough to bear the Mirror Soul of the Divine Roaming Mirror. If you use it as a bridge, you really might be able to refine that world!”

“Hmph!”

“But Granny…” Wen Zishan’s expression suddenly turned serious, his tone earnest, “Have you thought about it? Even if you get the Warm Spirit Lotus, if the Mirror Soul doesn’t respond to you, how will you refine it?”

“Why wouldn’t the Mirror Soul respond to me?” Granny You shrieked, “I’ve guarded the Divine Roaming Mirror for two thousand years. I know it better than anyone! As long as I get the Warm Spirit Lotus, I’m absolutely confident I can fuse the Mirror Soul with it!”

“Are you sure?” Wen Zishan gazed at her meaningfully. “Are you sure it’s that simple?” He paused, then his tone sharpened, “Or are you just deceiving yourself? Is this just your obsession with defeating me?”

Granny You suddenly froze.

Wen Zishan continued, “Granny, do you know why you were at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm two thousand years ago, and you’re still at the First Stage two thousand years later? What have you been doing all this time? What have you seen?”

Granny You’s expression gradually changed. The hatred and bloodshot in her eyes faded, replaced by confusion, emptiness, and then chaos.

Wen Zishan’s words seemed to touch something long buried deep in her heart.

“You know very well—even if you get the Warm Spirit Lotus, you might not be able to subdue the Mirror Soul.” Wen Zishan sighed softly.

“Nonsense!” Granny You cursed loudly.

“Then let me ask you: if it were really so easy to subdue the Mirror Soul, why didn’t the Great Emperor who took Yang away do it? He should have the ability.”

At these words, Granny You was stunned and left speechless.
