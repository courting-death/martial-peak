## Chapter 2301 — You Are All Bad People

"Since you have no regrets about dying, then go and die!"

Just as the fat martial artist was about to kiss Luo Bing, a chilling voice suddenly rang out.

The fat and thin martial artists, their lust clouding their minds and blood surging, were startled by the sudden voice, like birds at the twang of a bowstring; their hair stood on end.

The fat martial artist sprang up, but before he could see who had spoken, a fist came crashing toward him. Saint Yuan surged into the fist, a ferocious technique coalescing; it swelled before his eyes and blocked out all light.

The fat martial artist wanted to dodge, but found he couldn't avoid it no matter what. The opponent's cultivation seemed much higher than his own…

Bang…

A dull thud sounded, accompanied by the fat martial artist's miserable scream. His plump body flew backward, and in midair, his head burst like a smashed watermelon, red and white matter splattering everywhere.

"Ah!" As the sudden change occurred, the thin martial artist cried out in shock, but before he could react, his companion had already died tragically before his eyes.

He hurriedly looked up, only to see a burly, disheveled man had appeared at some point. The man looked as if he'd just fought a fierce battle, covered in blood, half his face swollen, his eyes full of blood, making it terrifying to behold. Especially since one of his eyes was completely white, without a trace of black, sending chills down one's spine.

"Y-You… who are you!" The thin martial artist swept his Divine Sense over, discovering the other had the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and his heart instantly sank.

He and the fat martial artist were only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, while the other was two stages higher. Although the burly man didn't seem to be at his peak, judging by the power of that punch, he was no match at all.

"The one sending you on your way!" the burly man snorted coldly. His iron tower-like body swayed slightly, then suddenly vanished.

Seeing this, the thin martial artist shouted, "Friend, let's talk this out! We have no enmity with you—why attack us?"

Though he said this, he immediately summoned his defensive Secret Treasure, forming a barrier of light to protect himself.

The burly man's voice suddenly sounded behind him, icy as death: "What is there to say to scum like you who bully men and women? Go die!"

As he spoke, a broadsword appeared in his hand. As Saint Yuan poured in, a tiger's roar echoed from the blade, and a giant tiger's head phantom appeared, its bloody maw snapping at the thin martial artist.

The thin martial artist, terrified, shouted, "I'll fight you to the death!"

Though his cultivation was two stages lower, he felt he still had a slim chance if he fought desperately. The fat martial artist had been killed in one punch only because he was caught off guard and hadn't summoned his Secret Treasure.

Now, with his defensive Secret Treasure protecting him, he was sure he wouldn't be killed in one blow.

But things developed beyond his expectations. The opponent's broadsword cleaved down, unstoppable, breaking through his defense and cutting into him.

"I-It can't be!" The thin martial artist stood frozen, staring at the massive wound stretching from his shoulder to his abdomen. Looking up at the burly man, he rasped, "Are you a Dao Origin Realm expert?"

In that instant, he had clearly sensed the aura only a Dao Origin Realm martial artist possessed, and the broadsword was obviously a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure. That was why it had so easily broken his defense and dealt a fatal blow.

"A dying man need not ask so much," the burly man snorted coldly.

As he spoke, blood gushed from the thin martial artist like a fountain, and his body split in two, his organs spilling out.

The air was thick with the stench of blood!

Luo Bing lay on the ground, trembling violently, her beautiful eyes wide, teeth chattering. She turned her head and retched.

Raised in comfort since childhood, she had never witnessed such a bloody, brutal scene. The intense shock overwhelmed her.

She vomited for a long while, even bringing up bile, before feeling a bit better. Pale-faced, she looked at the burly man with tears of gratitude, her voice trembling: "A-Are they… are they dead?"

The burly man glanced at her coldly. For some reason, a deep look of disgust flashed in his single eye. He had no intention of answering, only snorted and put away his broadsword.

Then he walked over to Luo Bing and tapped her several times.

Luo Bing's sealed cultivation was instantly released, Saint Yuan flowing through her meridians again. She shakily stood up, glanced fearfully at the corpses, quickly looked away, covered her mouth, and retched again.

The burly man said nothing, just watched coldly from the side.

After a while, Luo Bing looked up at him and said, "Thank you, thank you…"

She thanked him repeatedly, sincerely.

If not for this burly man's sudden appearance, she would have faced a tragic fate. She had never encountered such danger before, and in that desperate moment, she had kept hoping someone would come to save her.

Someone really had come. Though he looked frightening, with a fierce appearance, Luo Bing somehow didn't fear him. His iron tower-like build even gave her an indescribable sense of security. She couldn't help but imagine that, under such broad wings, she might never suffer misfortune again.

It was a feeling her father, or even Qiu Yu, had never given her.

For some reason, her heart began to beat wildly, a strange feeling growing inside.

"W-What is your name?" Luo Bing asked timidly.

The burly man glanced at her, his single eye cold.

Under his gaze, Luo Bing shivered and quickly lowered her head, not daring to look again.

"Chai Hu!" the burly man suddenly spat out.

Luo Bing brightened, looked up, and smiled: "So it's Eldest Brother Chai. My name is Luo Bing. I'm the City Lord's daughter—have you heard of me?"

After speaking, she froze.

Except for Qiu Yu, she had never addressed another man so intimately, but in front of this burly man, it came naturally. She felt no discomfort; instead, after saying it, she felt a secret joy, as if she'd done something remarkable.

What's wrong with me? Luo Bing's beautiful eyes were full of confusion.

"I know who you are," Chai Hu replied blandly, looking away, as if not wanting to frighten her with his fearsome face.

"Of course, I don't go out much, but since Eldest Brother Chai lives in Tianhe City, you must have heard of me." Luo Bing smiled, brightening the world.

After hesitating, she said, "Eldest Brother Chai, I… I'm lost. Can you take me home?"

She looked delicate and weak, her face still pale from fright. Any man would find it hard to refuse such a request.

Chai Hu nodded: "I can."

Luo Bing was delighted. "Thank you!"

"But not today," Chai Hu added coldly.

Luo Bing's smile froze. She stared at Chai Hu and asked, "Eldest Brother Chai, what do you mean?"

Chai Hu said, "I need Miss Luo's help with something. Come with me."

Luo Bing was startled. Remembering how those two had treated her, her face turned pale again. She backed away, shaking her head: "Are you going to treat me like they did?"

"You're overthinking it. I won't hurt you. But you must cooperate!" As he spoke, Chai Hu reached for Luo Bing.

"No!" Luo Bing cried, but Chai Hu's cultivation was far higher than the others. She couldn't resist and was subdued in an instant.

Luo Bing felt as if she'd fallen into an ice cellar. Today's ordeals were more dramatic than anything she'd ever experienced. She hadn't expected to escape one danger only to fall into another. She pounded Chai Hu's arm, shouting, "Bad man, bad man, you're all bad people!"

Chai Hu was unmoved, only saying coldly, "If you keep struggling, don't blame me for being rough!"

Luo Bing froze, but soon bit down hard on the back of Chai Hu's hand.

She bit down fiercely, and soon her mouth was filled with blood, but she refused to let go.

Chai Hu, a Third Stage Void King Realm martial artist, could have easily broken her teeth with a little force.

But for some reason, he didn't. Staring at Luo Bing, who was biting him and swallowing his blood to protect herself, a complicated emotion flashed in his eyes. He sighed, raised his hand, and delivered a precise chop to her neck.

He controlled his strength perfectly. Luo Bing only let out a soft cry before collapsing, unconscious, with two lines of tears slowly sliding down her cheeks.

Then Chai Hu bent down, picked her up, and disappeared, leaving only the corpses of the fat and thin martial artists behind.

Heaven Puppet Tower.

Yang Kai strolled back and saw Ye Qinghan anxiously pacing at the door, constantly looking out. When she saw Yang Kai, she seemed relieved and greeted him, "Young Master Yang, where did you go?"

Yang Kai said, "Just wandering around." As he spoke, he glanced at Ye Qinghan and smiled, "What? Afraid I'd leave without saying goodbye?"

Ye Qinghan waved her hands, "No, no, it's just that you disappeared and no one could tell me where you went…"

Yang Kai said, "Don't worry, I won't break my promise. Actually, I wanted to let you know before I left, but there seemed to be more than one person in your room, so I didn't disturb you. Heh heh!"

Ye Qinghan blushed and spat, "You're awful!"

She stomped her foot and fled into the inner hall.
