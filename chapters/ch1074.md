## Chapter 1074 — Pill Cloud

This valley seemed to have suffered some unknown catastrophe; Zong Ao's palace had been destroyed, the thousand-mu medicinal fields were gone, and the surrounding arrays around the valley were shattered to pieces.

Zong Ao sat like a man who had lost his soul, slumped on the ground, covered in dust, his eyes blazing with fury.

Only Yang Kai remained, cross-legged amid dozens of pill furnaces and broken walls, motionless.

"What happened?" Halika and the others were stunned.

This place was the forbidden ground of the entire Rainfall Star; ordinarily no one dared come here. No matter how they looked at it, they couldn't understand why this place appeared to have been plundered.

The group exchanged glances, mustered their courage, and flew down to stand beside Zong Ao. Halika cautiously called out, "Elder Zong, what happened here?"

Lin Mufeng roared in anger, "Did some blind fool come here to cause trouble? Elder Zong, just tell us and we'll give you satisfaction!"

The middle-aged woman next to him nodded vigorously, her eyes full of murderous intent and ill will.

Zong Ao lifted his head, stared at them with vacant eyes, then suddenly sprang up and pointed viciously in Yang Kai's direction, snarling, "It was that bastard boy who destroyed my medicinal fields and wrecked my palace. Now I have nowhere to live, and the herbs I've cultivated for a hundred years are all gone. If you truly want to avenge me, kill him!"

He spat saliva and phlegm in the three of their faces; they stood frozen, not daring to move, their expressions a study in awkwardness.

After a long moment, Halika gave an embarrassed laugh and tried to soothe him, "Elder Zong, calm your anger, calm your anger. What happened? Weren't you refining restorative pills for Lady Xue? A few days ago when I passed by you were fine — how could this happen in only a few months?"

He could see that although Zong Ao raged and wanted them to go kill Yang Kai to vent his anger, it was only words.

Yang Kai was meditating and looked utterly weak. If Zong Ao truly wanted his life, why bother to use other people's hands? Even at his peak Yang Kai could not match Zong Ao, let alone now.

“Who told you it was this old man refining the pills?” Zong Ao shot them a sidelong glance.

“If it wasn’t you, then could it have been Brother Yang?” Lin Mufeng let out a dry laugh.

Zong Ao rolled his eyes and didn't bother to explain.

He knew that even if he told the truth, others probably wouldn't believe him. If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, Zong Ao himself would have treated the tale as idle gossip.

But the pill in the jade bottle in his hand was solid proof — this boy had truly been able, with a Third Stage of the Saint Realm cultivation, to refine a Saint King-Grade Pill that bore a Pill Cloud.

"Get out, all of you!" Zong Ao waved impatiently. "I've been living here in peace for a hundred years, and one stinking brat comes and turns the place into a mess. If any of you dare come within a hundred li of here again, I'll rip your heads off!"

The three Origin Returning Realm experts shrank back, tails between their legs, and retreated hastily, not daring to linger.

They had only gone a short distance when Zong Ao's voice called from behind, "Wait!"

Halika turned and put on a smiling face, "Does Elder Zong have further instructions?"

Zong Ao pointed toward the dilapidated palace and snapped, “Go find some people and build me a new residence! Do you have no eyes at all? Are you planning to make me sleep out in the wilderness?”

Halika shouted orders. They had brought many warriors with them and left a dozen or so to gather materials and rebuild a shelter for Zong Ao before they apologized and departed.

Those ten or so people scattered and flew off, seemingly to search for building materials.

Zong Ao glanced at the still-unconscious Yang Kai, then at the Leaving Flame Pill in the jade bottle in his hand, and exhaustion and gloom crept across his face.

It was a full three days before Yang Kai slowly regained consciousness.

A heavy weakness spread through every part of his body. Yang Kai paused, recalled everything before he went under, and couldn't help but smile bitterly as his spirit slipped into the Sea of Consciousness to investigate.

Inside his Sea of Consciousness things were dim; the once vast waters were gone, replaced by a thin film of liquid. The Warm Spirit Lotus was doing its best to nurture his spirit, but it would take at least ten days for his Sea of Consciousness to fill again.

Every muscle in his body ached, and his Saint Yuan had been greatly depleted.

Yang Kai had never felt such a thing; injury might be said to have occurred, but it was also like no injury at all — only an endless weariness as if part of his vitality had been siphoned away, making him feel prematurely old.

Struggling to his feet, he looked around and saw Zong Ao a short distance away glaring at him with rage — the old man's face was frighteningly dark, his eyes full of a devouring light.

Yang Kai sniffed, unsure why Zong Ao had taken on such a terrifying expression.

When he took in the surroundings, he immediately understood.

Without dwelling on his misfortune, he searched the ruins for a while, pulled the long-neglected Xue Yue out from under some wooden planks, and found a comfortable spot on a peak a few li away to sit.

Before he could catch his breath, Zong Ao had silently appeared at his side.

Yang Kai looked at him without speaking, only breathing hard.

"Don't you want to ask whether you succeeded?" Zong Ao waited a moment, then couldn't help but ask.

"I did my utmost. That's enough." Yang Kai replied.

Zong Ao regarded him intently, then slightly nodded, "For that sentence alone, I won't press you for the losses you've caused this time."

He could get compensation from Halika and the others; they wouldn't dare refuse to make amends.

Saying that, he tossed the jade bottle he'd been clutching at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it, glanced inside, and felt no great surprise or excitement — everything seemed to be as he had expected.

Inside the jade bottle lay a pill covered in a misty cloud; even through the bottle a strong energy fluctuation could be perceived.

It seemed almost alive, with a regular pulsation coming from within.

A Pill Cloud — this was a Leaving Flame Pill that had developed a Pill Cloud!

Although only a Lower-Level Saint King-Grade, such a pill held immense collectible value and would draw skilled alchemists like moths to a flame; they might tear each other apart to obtain it.

From the Pill Cloud they could glean many useful pieces of information that might improve their alchemical arts.

As Yang Kai observed, Zong Ao recounted in brief the events that had occurred after he fell unconscious, casually remarking, "The Pill Cloud on your pill looks different from some of the ones I refined."

"How is it different?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Zong Ao tossed over several more jade bottles; each contained a different pill — only four in total.

These four pills were those Zong Ao had refined over the past hundred years — lucky, occasional births.

Yang Kai compared the Leaving Flame Pill to those few pills and immediately noticed the greatest difference.

The Pill Clouds covering Zong Ao's pills were sparse and didn't envelop the whole pill; one of them had a Pill Cloud covering only half.

Moreover, Yang Kai could clearly feel that the medicinal potency and energy within the Leaving Flame Pill were more than twice as strong as Zong Ao's four pills.

Zong Ao then produced a Saint Crystal and placed it in Yang Kai's hand.

The Saint Crystal's energy was drawn by the Pill Cloud and quickly gathered into the pill, being absorbed and enhancing its efficacy.

"When a pill develops Pill Patterns, its potency can grow geometrically and it can be preserved for a long time without worry of dissipation. Ordinary pills can't do this; the longer they are stored the more their effects leak away, and after thirty or fifty years they'd be useless. But once a pill develops a Pill Cloud it can be preserved for years and years. The Pill Cloud will actively absorb the world's Spiritual Qi to nourish the pill, refining its efficacy more and more. So the longer a Pill Cloud-bearing pill is stored, the stronger its potency becomes!" Zong Ao spoke as if to himself, explaining patiently.

Yang Kai nodded; he knew this well from experience.

When he had once taken a pill with a Pill Cloud, he had nearly been burst by it — that pill had been several thousand years old.

"This one of mine was accidentally refined ninety years ago," Zong Ao said, taking up another jade bottle that contained a brown pill. "Ninety years of nurturing has increased its potency by more than double, and it's a Middle-Level Saint King-Grade, yet compared to the Leaving Flame Pill you refined a few days ago it still pales in comparison."

"That may be due to the completeness of the Pill Cloud," Yang Kai mused.

"That's what I think as well," Zong Ao nodded lightly. "I always thought Pill Clouds were like this, but seeing your Leaving Flame Pill I realize a Pill Cloud can be more complete — it can wrap the entire pill. And notice, your pill absorbs Saint Crystal energy faster than mine. If left for a few hundred years, its value could rival a star!"

"Is that possible?" Yang Kai was taken aback, thinking the old man fanciful.

"Why not?" Zong Ao sneered. "Do you know how many Origin Returning Realm experts have chased the dream of reaching the Void King Realm their entire lives? Even the few Void King Realm cultivators seek ways to strengthen and elevate their realm. A Leaving Flame Pill left for centuries could push a fire-practice Void King Realm to a higher step — would they not give a star in exchange for it?"

Hearing him, Yang Kai found the idea plausible, though somewhat exaggerated.

"Are you still willing to let this girl take the pill?" Zong Ao gazed at him and then at the unconscious Xue Yue.

"She's nearly dead — what's there to be stingy about?" Yang Kai scoffed. He had painstakingly refined the Leaving Flame Pill; wasn't it precisely to give to Xue Yue?

Zong Ao's face twitched as if he had words to say but held them back, then waved his hand, "Fine — the pill is yours to decide, but you must tell me how you produced the Pill Cloud."

"I don't know." Yang Kai shook his head.

Zong Ao nearly spat blood.
