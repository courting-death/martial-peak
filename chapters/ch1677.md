## Chapter 1677 — Breaking the Siege

Shen Shitao's eyes immediately reddened. "But Elders, you..."

"Rest assured, we'll buy you time. Remember — go to Lingxiao Sect; only by reaching Lingxiao Sect will there be a way to live! This mission is arduous; you must find an opportunity to bring the disciples into Lingxiao Sect!"

"Elder!" Shen Shitao kept shaking her head.

“What are you waiting for? Go!” the beautiful woman snapped sharply, glaring at Shen Shitao. “Do you want our Qiantian Sect to be erased from Dark Star? Do you want us to have no face left to meet the ancestors?”

Shen Shitao went blank, grief rendering her speechless.

Another Qiantian Sect elder looked at Shen Shitao with gentle eyes and smiled, "Remember, you must live. Wait for the Great Elder to return. As long as the Great Elder returns, our Qiantian Sect can be revived."

"Move!" the beautiful woman shouted.

Tears fell like rain from Shen Shitao; her delicate body trembled as she knelt, and with utmost reverence she kowtowed to the elders three times, then sprang up and prepared to leave.

Just then――

The beautiful woman standing on the city wall and the few remaining experts of Qiantian Sect seemed to have noticed something incredible; they lifted their heads and stared toward a distant point.

Where their eyes reached, the ranks behind the Corpse Spirit Sect were in utter chaos; turbulent, powerful energy waves exploded through heaven and earth, a dazzling brilliance burst forth, and with each breath hundreds of the Corpse Spirit Sect's soldiers were cut down.

"Elder Du, it looks like someone attacked over there!"

"I see it — who could it be?" the beautiful woman nodded slightly.

"Not many, only about seven or eight, but so powerful…" The Origin Returning Realm expert gasped, he had only seen flashes of light over there as swathes of the Corpse Spirit Sect's cultivators fell like reaped stalks, leaving him stunned.

"Eh, that is… that is the Chaotic Heaven Sun Tower! It's the Great Elder! The Great Elder has returned!" someone cried out excitedly.

Every eye instantly fixed on the sky, upon a tower-shaped Secret Treasure over ten zhang tall, its whole body exuding a blue mysterious light.

That tower-shaped Secret Treasure spun and spun, slamming down from the heights; each fall smashed countless Corpse Spirit Sect disciples into meat, and the tower continuously unleashed innumerable streaks of blue mysterious light. The beams looked razor-sharp — once struck, the Corpse Spirit Sect disciples and their lackeys would be annihilated, utterly erased from this world.

In a brief moment, the number of Corpse Spirit Sect disciples killed beneath that Secret Treasure had already reached two hundred.

"It truly is the Chaotic Heaven Sun Tower!" The beautiful woman's eyes shone with astonishing light, as if hope had been reborn; her expression brightened.

The Chaotic Heaven Sun Tower was Qiantian Sect's Ancestral Treasure, a Secret Treasure between Origin-Grade and Void King-Grade — one could say it was practically a quasi-Void King-Grade Secret Treasure.

And this formidable Secret Treasure had always been in the hands of the Great Elder, Mo Yu.

Its appearance now was clearly due to Mo Yu's prompting.

Even without seeing Mo Yu's figure, everyone could sense his familiar energy fluctuation from afar.

"Now we're saved, the Great Elder has returned!"

"Hahaha, slaughter these Corpse Spirit Sect bastards!"

"Let none of them return!"

"Avenge the Sect Master and our fallen brothers and sisters!"

In an instant, wild shouts erupted from atop the city walls. Everyone was seething with righteous fury, their emotions surging; if not for the lack of an order from the beautiful woman, they would have already charged down to join the Great Elder in battle.

Among the crowd, the beautiful woman's brows were tightly knit; unease rippled across her face.

The Great Elder's sudden arrival at this moment — whether it was a blessing or a curse no one could tell!

Although the Great Elder's power was unfathomable and bolstered by the Chaotic Heaven Sun Tower, the enemy numbers were overwhelming. If the Great Elder fell into an encirclement and could not break free, Qiantian Sect's last hope might be extinguished.

"Relay my order. All able fighters of Qiantian Sect, follow this city lord down to assist the Great Elder!" The beautiful woman's thoughts raced and she swiftly decided.

"Yes!" an answer came at once, and the command was passed along.

Before long, the remaining forces of Qiantian Sect gathered together. Looking at the fewer than a thousand survivors, the beautiful woman’s eyes filled with deep sorrow.

The whole Qiantian Sect now amounted to only these people; almost everyone bore wounds, and their strengths varied wildly!

Though Haicheng City held a population of one million, those who truly belonged to Qiantian Sect numbered only this handful; the rest were ordinary people who had never cultivated, or fighters so weak they could barely contribute.

“This time, there is only death ahead, no life—our sole purpose is to support the Great Elder. Are you all prepared?” the beautiful woman shouted sternly as she swept her gaze around.

One thousand people answered solemnly in unison, "We are!"

“In the days to come, your names will surely be engraved upon Qiantian Sect’s Spirit Monument! Move out!” The beautiful woman wasted no words—decisive and swift, she waved her fair hand and was the first to charge out of Haicheng City.

The others followed closely; hatred carved deep on every face, and in each eye burned a resolve to place themselves into death in order to be reborn!

A thousand surged from the city, and countless others trailed behind.

These were Haicheng City's residents and the warriors who had fled here!

They knew well that when the nest is destroyed no egg survives; seeing Qiantian Sect marshal its remaining forces to strike, they immediately followed and lent their strength.

Beneath Haicheng City it seemed a vast army was on the move!

“That woman Du Yanling has gone mad, hahaha! Bringing along a bunch of trash who haven’t even reached the Saint Realm and thinking she can break through my Corpse Spirit Sect’s blockade? Kill them all, and bring Du Yanling to me!” At the center of the Corpse Spirit Sect’s army stood a burly man atop the front of an eight-horse war chariot, pointing forward as he bellowed his command.

Like Fang Fengqi, he too cultivated to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet his aura felt chilling and carried a faint stench of rot.

A member of the Corpse Spirit Race!

And a top-tier corpse general expert!

No sooner had he spoken than a blue tower suddenly descended from the sky. The burly man snorted and leaped aside to evade the terrifying strike.

With a thunderous boom, the massive blue tower came crashing down. The eight fine horses pulling the chariot were instantly smashed into pulp, their blood and entrails splattering across the ground.

"Who dares!" he bristled, red needle-like spines prickling across his body; two grisly fangs bared at the corner of his mouth as he turned and roared toward a direction.

A graceful figure suddenly appeared beside him—a vision of ethereal beauty, like a celestial maiden descending from the heavens. Behind her spread a pair of crystalline, snow-white wings, carved of ice and jade, and from her body emanated a bone-chilling cold that seemed capable of freezing even one’s very soul.

In her hand she held a long sword that gave off an icy sheen.

The longsword swept through the air—fluid and unstoppable, like mercury pouring across the ground.

The burly corpse general tried to resist, but the all-pervading cold froze the strength within his body.

After only three moves, the woman severed his head with a single sword.

Crack, crack...

The profound intent of ice spread everywhere; even this Corpse Spirit Race member, whose life force was astonishingly tenacious, was frozen in an instant. His vitality was utterly extinguished.

Su Yan!

This was the first time she had acted since leaving Chi Lan Star, and at her very first strike she displayed jaw-dropping combat power that made Mo Yu's eyelids twitch.

He could clearly sense how strong that corpse general had been; even in single combat it would have taken at least two or three hours to settle a victor, and even victory would have come at a cost.

Yet Yang Kai's woman had dealt with that corpse general in just a few moves.

Yang Kai was already monstrous — how had the woman with him become so monstrous as well? Mo Yu was stunned.

After killing that corpse general, Su Yan pressed on without pause, wielding the Profound Frost Divine Sword and employing the Yao Transformation Technique, borrowing the Ice Phoenix's primordial power. Alone she charged into the ranks of the Corpse Spirit Race; wherever she passed, men and horses were overturned and none stood as a match.

All those slain became ice sculptures.

At the very front of the battlefield stood a small group of Qiantian Sect disciples who had rushed out earlier than Yang Kai and the others, striving to repair Haicheng City's seals and formations to buy time.

Six hundred at first — now fewer than one hundred remained.

They were beset on all sides, surrounded by countless enemies; with each breath someone fell and blood soaked the earth.

Among the crowd was a long-haired girl whose figure was as nimble as a rabbit; she darted left and right through enemy ranks, her body shimmering with multicolored radiance. She looked delicate but harbored terrifying power; her small fists struck out and even the air rang with explosive force.

Any enemy struck by her who had not reached the Origin Returning Realm exploded on the spot.

Even a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior struck once would suffer torn sinews and broken bones and scream in agony.

Countless attacks rained in her direction and she evaded them with masterful ease; for the few unavoidable blows that landed, she took little harm and instead a ferocious predatory light flared in her clear eyes!

This girl's body seemed unbelievably sturdy.

If not for her single-handed protection, the remaining hundred members of Qiantian Sect would likely have been wiped out long ago.

Each surviving warrior cast grateful looks toward the girl.

Her deeds at last drew Yang Kai's attention.

The multicolored radiance covering her gave Yang Kai a warm, familiar feeling — it was unmistakably the sword qi of the Undying Five Elements Sword!

From a great distance Yang Kai stole a glance at the girl. She was drenched in blood and it was hard to judge her exact age, but from her development she seemed no more than thirteen or fourteen years old.

Her body was clearly not yet fully grown.

As her hair fluttered, her face gave Yang Kai a faint sense of familiarity.

"Could it be…" Yang Kai frowned, quickly clearing the enemies before him, then, intrigued by the girl, he and Xia Ningshang charged toward her.

Sensing the attackers, the girl turned and threw a punch.

Yang Kai raised a hand to block.

Boom…

An unimaginable force burst from that frail fist; even the powerful Yang Kai's body rocked. Fortunately his cultivation was far higher than the girl's and he did not lose face — otherwise he might have been utterly humiliated.
