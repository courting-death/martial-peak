## Chapter 1556 — Tender Affection

Although everyone was elated, they all knew leaving the Tongxuan Continent and entering the Star Domain was no simple matter.

Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya had joined forces and still failed; the difficulty involved spoke for itself.

Now that they heard Yang Kai dare make such a promise, they were overjoyed beyond measure.

"Quiet, quiet!" Ling Taixu pressed the air with his hand, smiling, "Since Young Yang Kai says this, he must have a foolproof plan, right?"

Saying that, he looked at Yang Kai with a cheerful smile.

"Grandmaster, judge for yourself — bringing you all into the Star Domain is indeed not a troublesome matter. Hmm, to put it plainly, it’s not just those present here; I can take your clansmen, and even the people of the entire Nine Heavens Sacred Land with me, it will only take some time."

"Take everyone?" Ling Taixu was shocked.

Not to mention the War Soul Hall and Poxuan Palace over here, when they came from Zhongdu back then there were three to four thousand people all at once; even the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had more than two thousand disciples.

In total that added up to five to six thousand people. With such a vast number, how could Yang Kai take them all? The power of the Starry Sky was extremely great; even if Yang Kai reached the Origin Returning Realm, he couldn’t protect so many people.

"Hmm, I have my own way, Grandmaster needn’t worry." Yang Kai grinned, "The key is whether you’re willing to go."

"Willing — of course we’re willing!" Huo Xingchen immediately cried out, urgent: "When do we depart?"

"Heh, Brother Huo, don’t be impatient. Although you are the head of your family, matters like this still need to be discussed with your clansmen; perhaps some won’t want to leave. Those willing to go can come with me; those who aren’t can remain. Yes — the Qiu Family, the Yang Family, the Dong Family — treat it the same way. Miss Qiu, Eldest Brother, Cousin, you are now family heads, handle this yourselves and discuss it carefully with your elders."

"We understand." Yang Wei and Dong Qinghan nodded.

Qiu Yimeng also echoed from the side; the dimness in her beautiful eyes seemed to regain some sparkle at the news.

Being able to enter the Star Domain — she might reach a higher Stage. She did not seek to equal Yang Kai, only to narrow the distance between them; perhaps someday she could touch him...

She glimpsed a sliver of hope, and it made her suddenly radiant.

"So that means I won’t have to be separated from you for so long or across such distances anymore?" Dong Suzhu looked at Yang Kai excitedly.

Yang Kai was her only child, but since her son entered Lingxiao Pavilion at thirteen she and Yang Kai had often been apart. It used to be better — though she couldn’t see him, at least she knew he lived well in Lingxiao Pavilion. Later, during the Succession War, Yang Kai had been only a hundred li away from her.

But since Yang Kai left the Tongxuan Continent and went deep into the Star Domain, more than thirty years passed without seeing him or hearing a word.

If Fourth Master Yang hadn’t spent these years painstakingly nursing her body and heart, Dong Suzhu would likely have collapsed long ago.

Today, learning she could go to the Star Domain with her son, Dong Suzhu was indescribably happy.

Yang Kai glanced at her and gave a slight nod.

Dong Suzhu smiled kindly, a smile from the bottom of her heart.

"No time to delay. I’ll go find those old men to discuss it now." Huo Xingchen was unwilling to waste time and hurriedly rose to leave; from his demeanor it seemed he’d start a fight if anyone objected.

"I’ll go too." Yang Wei rose and left.

Qiu Yimeng followed closely behind.

They didn’t want to delay anything.

Their yearning for higher Stages of the Martial Dao made them long for the wonders within the Star Domain.

Before long, only Ling Taixu and Fourth Master Yang and his wife remained in the main hall.

The family was finally reunited.

There were countless words to say, endless longing to pour out.

Upon learning Yang Kai still hadn’t found any trace of Su Yan, Dong Suzhu sighed and comforted him.

She was very fond of Su Yan as a daughter-in-law.

"Boy, I don’t object to your constantly worrying about Su Yan, but have you thought about how the people here will cope?" Fourth Master Yang suddenly looked at Yang Kai and asked pointedly.

"Little Senior Sister?" Yang Kai chuckled, "I’ve already seen her, but she seems to have some problem; when she wakes I’ll ask her properly."

"Don’t play dumb!" Fourth Master Yang glared, "There isn’t only Xia Ningshang here; there are several others."

"Where did so many come from?" Yang Kai protested loudly, looking aggrieved.

"Hmph — the War Soul Hall alone has one, Twin Pavilion has two! Do you think I don’t know?" Fourth Master Yang sneered proudly, "Though I say nothing, I know better than anyone."

Yang Kai’s face burned bright red.

Dong Suzhu giggled beside him and secretly gave him a thumbs-up; Fourth Master Yang had loved her all his life and lived happily, but she still hoped more beauties would accompany her son, preferably bearing seven, eight, even ten grandchildren so their later years wouldn’t be dull.

Even if Yang Kai was not there to fulfill his duties as a son, they could at least spend their days doting on their grandchildren.

"Alright, alright, it's young people’s matters — don’t meddle. Yang Kai is not unreasonable; I doubt he’d let a young girl be left in sorrow." Ling Taixu interjected.

With Grandmaster speaking, Fourth Master Yang immediately shrank back and nodded repeatedly in agreement.

Everyone in the War Soul Hall and the ruins of Poxuan Palace mobilized. The families who had followed Yang Kai here back then convened elders’ meetings frequently over these days; every clan seemed to be discussing some great matter.

All learned Yang Kai had returned, and the news of going to the Star Domain spread.

No coercion — all voluntary.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land also received Yang Kai’s summons; the orders were the same as over at War Soul Hall. In addition, Yang Kai sent messages to the Tianxiao Sect.

Two days later Yang Kai returned to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

He went straight to the secret chamber where Xia Ningshang cultivated.

The Little Senior Sister still slept; the last Qi Deviation had drained her greatly and she had yet to awaken.

Yang Kai sat by her side, took her jade hand, and gently poured some Saint Yuan into her.

After a moment, Xia Ningshang’s long lashes trembled. Yang Kai sat on the bedside and turned to her, smiling as he waited.

After a while, Xia Ningshang opened her beautiful eyes; upon seeing Yang Kai, her pupils froze. She stared at him in a daze.

Their eyes met, recalling the accidental stirrings in the Jiuyin Valley back then.

Her heart fluttered, laced with a tangle of panicked confusion.

Xia Ningshang suddenly pursed her lips and smiled.

"Why the silly smile?" Yang Kai asked, grinning at her.

"That dream... it was so long!" Xia Ningshang exclaimed, then slipped her hand back and clasped Yang Kai's large palm, gripping it with surprising strength and holding on as if she never wanted to let go.

Yang Kai grinned as well, then leaned down and pressed a deep, tender kiss upon her ruby lips.

The Little Senior Sister almost lost her breath.

Their lips parted; her body warmed, and her eyes grew hazy.

"In your dream, did you do these things with me?" Yang Kai wore a roguish look.

Xia Ningshang’s pretty face flushed crimson. She shifted and buried her head against Yang Kai’s clothing, as if too shy to face anyone.

Yang Kai obtained his answer and laughed heartily.

Suddenly Xia Ningshang’s body trembled; she sat up in haste, stunned. Her eyes focused on Yang Kai’s face, shining with mingled suspicion and delight.

"Junior Brother, you…" Xia Ningshang opened her mouth, brows knitted beautifully, still somewhat bewildered.

"I’m back." Yang Kai said softly.

The Little Senior Sister covered her red lips with her hand; her eyes trembled and a misty moisture filled them.

Tears slid down her cheeks, and the rims of her eyes reddened at once.

She finally realized everything was real, not merely a dream.

The man she had longed for day and night sat alive at her bedside, gazing at her so tenderly that she felt she might melt within that gaze of deep, tender affection.

She could not believe it!

"I really am back." Yang Kai reached out and pulled her into his embrace, holding her tightly as if he wanted to press her into his very being.

Xia Ningshang made soft sounds, hugging Yang Kai with equal force, her throat emitting choking sobs.

Those cries made Yang Kai’s heart ache.

Righting her posture, Yang Kai silenced her sobs with domineering force.

Clothes in disarray, the room overflowed with spring’s warmth and passion.

All the yearning and deep-rooted affection, in that moment, settled and blossomed into happiness that made Xia Ningshang nearly dizzy.

Such is the nature of love between man and woman.

After an hour, Yang Kai strode out of the chamber in high spirits and grand bearing.

Behind him, Xia Ningshang wore a veil and followed with her head lowered, unbearably shy.

Her delicate earlobes and slender neck were still a rosy hue, stirring the heart.

Like a withered blade of grass revived by dew and rain, Xia Ningshang now bloomed with an indescribable allure—enough to bewitch all beings and drive any man to madness.

Their hands were tightly linked, as if their hearts were one.

Not far off, a streak of light shot over at high speed, as if it had come looking for Yang Kai; but when it saw the scene, it immediately turned and vanished in the blink of an eye.

"Master..." Xia Ningshang uttered a tender cry, wishing the earth would open and swallow her.

She recognized the person in that retreating light as Meng Wuya.

Yang Kai grinned foolishly; Xia Ningshang bit her red lips, stamping her foot in vexation and embarrassment.

"Forget it, Shopkeeper Meng must have nothing important; otherwise he wouldn’t have left." Yang Kai comforted her, "Hmm, Little Senior Sister, there’s something I need to ask you."

"What is it?" Xia Ningshang timidly lifted her head to look at him, then quickly looked away at Yang Kai’s gaze.

Her bashful manner made Yang Kai want nothing more than to turn and return to the chamber...

With Saint Yuan circulating, he finally suppressed his stirring feelings and sobered, then said, "When I earlier helped you clear your meridians and Saint Yuan, I found a mass of gray qi in your body — what is that?"

"That thing..." Xia Ningshang frowned at his question, "Actually, I don’t know what it is either."

"You don’t know either?" Yang Kai was greatly surprised.

"Hmm, it followed me all along, ah — where did it go?" Xia Ningshang suddenly noticed something wrong; the mysterious energy that had always resided within her body had now vanished.
