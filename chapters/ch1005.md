## Chapter 1005 — Abundant Resources

On the Floating Continent, the people of the Sword Alliance and Purple Star had each formed their own camps, keeping to themselves without further conflict. Since that mysterious old man had appeared, seizing over a hundred Spatial Rings, he hadn’t been seen again for more than ten days. No one knew what he wanted with those rings, nor why he was collecting the fragments of the shattered warships.

Yang Kai and Shen Tu formed an alliance, keeping their distance from the two great powers and living in contentment.

After such an extended period of recuperation, Shen Tu finally recovered; the wounds he had suffered earlier had basically healed.

However, since Yang Kai had remained seated in meditation without waking, Shen Tu didn’t dare wander off on his own.

The two great forces began to probe the situation on this unknown continent. After some investigation, they confirmed what the mysterious old man had said before: there was no danger here.

They found no living creatures; it seemed that before the others arrived, the mysterious old man had been the only living being on this land.

While wary of that old man, people couldn’t help but feel a little sympathy for him.

To live alone in such a place, with no one to speak to, was indeed a dull and wearisome existence.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi also piloted their Star Shuttles, probing the skies in an attempt to leave this unknown continent and return to the Star Domain, to put distance between themselves and that old man whose reach seemed boundless.

But to their despair, no matter how high or how far they flew, they could not see any twinkling stars; the prismatic, misted sky was like a cage that kept them trapped on the continent.

As time passed, everyone grew restless; if not for the old man’s earlier words restraining them, both sides would likely have erupted into full-scale war at once.

Within the Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense—burning like flame—enveloped the spirit left by Wusuo after his death and began to fuse and consume it.

He had been refining it for more than ten days in succession, but with the strength of his Divine Sense, even now he still could not fully melt the Star Chart.

He had underestimated the grade of this Star Chart.

Yet he saw hope.

Wusuo’s spirit energy had already vanished, leaving only that intermittently shining, exquisitely beautiful Star Chart.

He continually employed his Divine Sense to penetrate it, leaving his own spirit imprint within the Star Chart and engraving his life’s aura upon it.

The whole process was like refining a Secret Treasure.

The Star Chart began to grow unstable, gradually swelling larger and larger, as if it might explode at any moment.

A faint unease stirred within Yang Kai. His Spirit Body descended onto the Six-Colored Treasure Isle once more, urging the power of his Sea of Consciousness to continue refining the Star Chart.

A faint sound rang out. Suddenly something within the Star Chart split open, as if a seam had cracked. The next moment, Yang Kai felt his Divine Sense surge wildly into that once-impenetrable Star Chart; the Sea of Consciousness’s mighty tide receded rapidly.

Multicolored lights burst within his Sea of Consciousness; one by one, twinkling stars shot forth in all directions. Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness raged and churned, thrown into disarray, making him dizzy in an instant.

Stars filled the heavens like a swarm of locusts passing through, countless and inexhaustible, streaming out from the Sea of Consciousness and soaring into the sky above it, beginning to dot the once-empty firmament.

Slowly, the sky of the Sea of Consciousness grew resplendent, as if an invisible hand were arranging a scene of wonders for Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stood on the Six-Color Treasure Isle in a daze, his spirit body staring blankly as his eyes brightened.

The scenery in his Sea of Consciousness was undergoing tremendous change at a rapid pace.

In about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, the turbulent Sea of Consciousness finally calmed.

At this moment, the landscape within the Sea of Consciousness differed greatly from before.

The Six-Color Treasure Isle still stood at the very center of the ocean, the World-Ending Demon Eye still floated in midair, and the sky, like nightfall draping itself in a veil, had been encrusted with a layer of starry radiance that dazzled the eye.

That was not an illusion forged by Yang Kai’s Divine Sense—it truly existed.

It was the mark of the Star Chart having fused with Yang Kai!

Overjoyed, Yang Kai grinned broadly while standing on the Six-Color Treasure Isle.

On impulse, Yang Kai fixed his gaze on a certain spot in the starry sky; several stars there immediately impressed themselves upon his vision.

The stars slowly turned, drawn by some mysterious force, mirroring the movements of the same stars in the same positions in the real heavens.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense wandered among those stars, witnessing firsthand the marvels of the Star Domain; his Divine Sense drained rapidly.

Although probing the Star Chart consumed a vast amount of Divine Sense, Yang Kai was content.

With such a Star Chart within his Sea of Consciousness, he would never fear losing his way again; he could precisely locate any destination he sought, and he might even become an excellent Chartmaster.

Composing himself, Yang Kai began to search for his own position.

Within the Star Chart there was a white light that flickered persistently; when Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense to it, that white point emitted a strange ripple, telling him that the point marked his present location.

Yang Kai’s expression grew odd.

He discovered that the white point on the Star Chart corresponded to the very center of the Chaos Abyss—the spot where the black hole had swallowed everyone.

Whether the Star Chart was perfectly accurate, Yang Kai couldn’t say; that would have to be verified later.

So he reined in his mind and stopped squandering his Divine Sense.

Slowly opening his eyes, a low murmur of astonishment immediately reached his ears.

Following the sound to a nearby spot, Yang Kai saw that on Purple Star’s side Liu Shan and Bi Ya were holding what looked like some medicinal plants, speaking excitedly to Lü Guichen.

Lü Guichen’s expression grew animated as well; a bright gleam appeared in his eyes as he took the herbs from them and probed them with focused concentration.

"What’s going on?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Purple Star seems to have discovered something extraordinary," Shen Tu replied; he had been watching that direction and, though he hadn’t heard what they said, formed his own conjecture.

"What is it?"

"Saint King-Grade medicinal herbs!" Shen Tu called out in a low voice.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

"They found them while exploring this continent, and there seem to be quite a number of them!"

"That old man said this place has abundant Spiritual Qi and rich resources…" Yang Kai frowned thoughtfully. "He also lamented that, regrettably, there are no rare mineral deposits here."

Shen Tu glanced at him: "No mineral deposits but abundant resources…could it be that this place is rich in medicinal herbs?"

"Very possible," Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"Purple Star is moving out." Shen Tu’s voice dropped; Yang Kai turned to look and indeed saw Purple Star’s warriors unleashing rainbow light and shooting off in all directions.

After a moment, Yue Xi of the Sword Alliance gathered her people, gave a few urgent orders, and the Sword Alliance fighters also set out.

Before leaving, He Zao cast a glance toward Yang Kai; their eyes met and He Zao inclined a head at him with apologetic warmth.

Yang Kai offered a faint smile in return.

These past days he had noticed He Miao trying to come over several times, but each time a male Sword Alliance warrior had barred her path.

He knew it was at Yue Xi’s instruction, so he didn’t mind.

"Yang Kai, let’s go look too!" Shen Tu suggested with some eagerness. "There’s nothing to do by staying here, and with Spiritual Qi this thick, the herbs must be high-grade."

"Agreed." Yang Kai considered briefly and had no objection. "It’s a good chance to collect some materials for pill refinement!"

"You can refine pills?" Shen Tu looked at him with surprise.

"Mm, I can manage a little. If we find suitable ingredients, I might be able to refine a Boundary-Breaking Pill to dispel the sealing in my body!" Yang Kai said in a low tone.

"Then what are we waiting for? Relying on oneself is better than relying on others—come, I’ll lead you!" Shen Tu said as he activated his Saint Yuan, enveloping Yang Kai, and they shot off in a chosen direction.

The sky was full of Sword Alliance and Purple Star warriors. Shen Tu and Yang Kai sped among them, occasionally hearing boisterous shouts and laughter.

"Upper-Level Saint King-Grade Jadeblood Grass! Such a large patch—hahaha, we’re set to profit!"

"Middle-Level Saint King-Grade Serenity Flower…"

"Come over here, there’s a Darkmoon Lingzhi!"

"Upper-Level Saint Grade Earth-Emperor Fruit, not that valuable…"

Perhaps because the medicinal herbs found here were of such high grade, the cultivators’ standards had risen accordingly. In the past, even Upper-Level Saint-Grade spiritual herbs and medicines, while not the most precious, were still quite valuable—no one would have ignored them. But now, these cultivators paid them no heed at all; everyone’s gaze was fixed on searching for Spiritual Herbs and Medicines of Saint King-Grade and above.

Shen Tu watched with a sour face as cultivators shared their good fortune with companions; his anxiety gnawed at him like a cat’s claws, fearing they would sweep the continent clean of herbs.

“Damn it, without a Star Shuttle we can’t fly as fast as they can,” Shen Tu cursed. He had been flying for over an hour yet still couldn’t find a suitable place to land—everywhere they passed, there were cultivators scouring the area.

"Keep going!" Yang Kai’s gaze grew deep as he stared ahead; vaguely, he saw a stretch of jungle.

Jungles have always been places that produce medicinal herbs.

"Why did they only now discover this continent’s abundance of herbs?" Yang Kai asked as they flew. They had been here nearly half a month already; such a discovery should have been made earlier.

"They feared that old man and dared not act rashly before. Only a few days ago did they begin to explore nearby regions and the sky to see what was around. That exploration led to this discovery," Shen Tu explained casually, his eyes suddenly brightening. "The jungle ahead should be untrampled—let’s check it out."

"Mm."

The two figures flashed through the air and plunged into the jungle.

As soon as they entered, both felt a jolt of spirit; the Spiritual Qi here was noticeably denser and more turbulent than in surrounding areas.

They exchanged a glance and knew they had come to the right place.

The denser the Spiritual Qi, the higher the grade of herbs it produces.

They released their Divine Sense at the same time, and after a short while Yang Kai pointed in a direction: "There’s something over here."

Shen Tu stared at him in astonishment. "You’re sure?"

“I’m sure of it! There’s a medicinal scent in the air.”
