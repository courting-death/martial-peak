## Chapter 737 — Soul Fusion

Time drifted on and the Ice Sect returned to its former tranquility; although the Saint Realm experts could clearly sense a scorching surge of energy emanating from an ice mountain, Qing Ya had warned them, and none dared to disturb it.

Ten days passed, a month passed, two months passed… the scorching energy never ceased, bursting forth from time to time.

Though they still did not much favor Yang Kai, his perseverance and resolve caused many to view him with newfound respect.

From time to time Qing Ya and Qian Yue would both glance in the direction of that ice mountain, sighing softly, their hearts full of wistful emotion.

Inside the ice chamber of that mountain, Yang Kai moved as if possessed, mechanically repeating his actions; his True Yuan and spiritual thoughts were ceaselessly conveyed toward Su Yan.

At first he received no response. Gradually, however, he began to sense some unusual stirrings — as if a Divine Sense sought to answer him but could not find the way.

Sensing this, Yang Kai's spirits soared and he redoubled his efforts without reserve.

He did not know how long it lasted; even he eventually felt a deep, bone-weary fatigue.

Suddenly his Divine Sense met utter blackness, as if it had fallen into a bottomless abyss and lost all direction.

A cutting cold crept through his soul; Yang Kai shivered involuntarily. He looked about and found darkness without bound, no glimmer of light — the only thing keenly perceptible was the cold that chilled him to the marrow.

Here a loneliness and yearning spread outward; faint and distant, Yang Kai heard a subtle voice calling his name.

His heart trembled; in an instant he realized — this was Su Yan's spiritual world.

Having cast Ice-Body Locking the Heart, she had sealed off all her perceptions; her spirit lay in darkness, yet a sliver of subconscious remained, about to respond to Yang Kai but trapped as if in a nightmare, unable to break free of that black shroud.

Yang Kai searched desperately, treading ceaselessly, yet the path beneath his feet seemed endless.

His Divine Sense surged wildly, stabbing into the black space and broadcasting his emotions in all directions.

Somewhere he received an unusual feedback; Yang Kai halted and closed his eyes to sense it more clearly.

After a moment he slowly opened his eyes. Ahead, within the darkness, a faint light was beginning to bloom.

Yang Kai grinned; his Spirit Body streaked toward that light. As he neared, a familiar aura came from it — the Divine Sense energy of Su Yan.

The light brightened and, the moment Yang Kai passed through it, the surrounding darkness was swept away and the place grew astonishingly bright.

He stood there, stunned.

The scene before him was one he knew intimately.

Lingxiao Pavilion!

Within his Divine Sense perception were the shabby hut he had once lived in, Su Yan's little pavilion, the Contribution Hall and all the familiar buildings — even the winding paths were unchanged, not the slightest detail missing.

The only difference from the Lingxiao Pavilion in reality was that here no one was present; the place was exceedingly tranquil and bitterly cold, with ice hanging everywhere.

This was Su Yan's spiritual world; everything here could be formed according to her thoughts and imaginings, just as the Warm Spirit Lotus in Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness had once transformed into the Five-Colored Treasure Island.

That Su Yan's spiritual world took the form of Lingxiao Pavilion could only be explained by how fond she was of those days in the Sect, so her subconscious had recreated the place.

Yang Kai understood that this was not something she had deliberately fabricated.

Unfortunately, even here he could not find Su Yan.

Standing there for a moment, Yang Kai smiled faintly and soon knew exactly where she must be.

His Spirit Body trod the long-unused paths, passed through the sect's walkways and came to the Dragon Confinement Ravine behind the Lingxiao Pavilion.

Beside that vast ravine a few fruit trees swayed in the wind, their branches heavy with red fruit; those trees had been planted by Yang Kai himself. When the Evil Lord had broken free from the ravine those trees had been destroyed — now they had reappeared within Su Yan's spiritual world.

Standing by the trees he fell into a reverie for a while, then suddenly leapt downward.

Midair he turned and, as if by habit, slipped into a cave in the ravine's cliff face.

It was Yang Kai's cave — a refuge he had painstakingly carved when he was weak; the stones of the cave had been cut with great toil using his True Yuan.

The cave was small, only the size of two rooms: the outer room where Yang Kai usually meditated and cultivated, and an inner chamber containing a stone bed for rest.

Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang often took naps upon that very stone bed.

Passing through the outer room into the inner, he indeed found a familiar, beautiful figure lying upon the stone bed.

Even within the spiritual world Su Yan slept. After employing Ice-Body Locking the Heart she had sealed even her Divine Sense; were it otherwise she would surely have sensed Yang Kai's presence.

He walked slowly over, stopped by the stone bed and squatted down, gazing at the sleeping beauty with boundless tenderness.

As if sensing a presence, Su Yan's eyelashes twitched, her brows knitted slightly, and after a moment a smile of relieved release curved her lips.

Her long lashes fluttered more strongly; suddenly she opened her eyes and stared in astonishment at Yang Kai crouched by the bed.

Yang Kai was taken aback.

Their eyes met and he scarcely dared to believe it.

Su Yan pressed her lips into a smile; with that smile the surrounding chill eased by a great deal.

"Su Yan..." Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

"Barreling into someone's Sea of Consciousness without permission, Junior Brother, you are bold." Su Yan chided him, lightly biting her lip.

"How are you... how have you awakened? You cast Ice-Body Locking the Heart, didn't you?" Yang Kai asked, overjoyed.

Su Yan slowly sat up and smiled. "Yes, but I set a restriction when I cast it."

"What restriction?" Yang Kai asked.

"If your Divine Sense breaks in and locates me, I will awaken for a moment."

"'Awaken for a moment?'" Yang Kai frowned.

"Mm." Su Yan nodded gently. "Only an awakening of the Divine Sense; the body remains in the state of Ice-Body Locking the Heart. Even Elder Qian Yue probably doesn't know this."

Su Yan had completely comprehended Ice-Body Locking the Heart and could employ it in many subtle ways. Qian Yue only assumed she could perform the technique at its lowest level; she had in fact already exhausted its depths.

"Why do this?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

"It speeds up cultivation." Su Yan appraised him up and down. "You seem to have grown stronger. If I don't train properly, won't I only hold you back later?"

Yang Kai could only laugh; now he understood why Su Yan had gone to such lengths.

"But what if someone else intrudes into your Sea of Consciousness?" A terrifying possibility occurred to Yang Kai: Su Yan sleeping there would be utterly ignorant of the outside world and powerless if a malicious party entered.

"No one else can do it — only you can. Perhaps some great expert might break through my Divine Sense defenses, but if that happens I would rather perish with them than allow them any gain." Su Yan's face was resolute.

"You're reckless!" Yang Kai scolded, his heart still trembling.

Su Yan paid it no mind; she reached out and stroked Yang Kai's cheek, speaking softly, "You look like you have suffered much."

Yang Kai shook his head slowly. "I haven't suffered; many took care of me along the way."

"That's good. How long has it been outside?"

"Since you fell asleep, barely a year has passed."

"Only a year... you came so quickly..." Su Yan's face was suffused with happiness and sweetness as she spoke.

"Then Senior Sister should give a reward," Yang Kai said with a mischievous laugh.

"What reward do you want?" she asked.

"What do you think?" he replied.

Her fair throat flushed crimson in an instant, and her beautiful eyes grew moist.

"It seems we have yet to try the Third-Tier of the Dual Cultivation Technique." Yang Kai's gaze burned; his eyes brimmed with hungry intent.

"Junior Brother..." Su Yan was overcome, her shyness boundless.

The Third-Tier is a fusion on the level of the soul; Su Yan understood this naturally. Though their bodies had already known each other, the thought of fusing their souls made her hesitate.

Once souls fused, all secrets would be laid bare to one another, without the slightest concealment.

"Su Yan..." Yang Kai grabbed her small hand without ceremony and began to stroke it, his eyes like wolves foraging in snow, flashing a predatory gleam.

Su Yan struggled symbolically, then fell still; she bit her red lips, sat upright on the stone bed and said nothing, her cheeks flushed.

Seeing her like that, Yang Kai abandoned all restraint, leapt onto the stone bed, sat facing her, took her soft hands in his and laughed in a low, silvered tone.

Soul fusion — only heard of in rumor — Yang Kai had never tried it himself. It was said to bring pleasures surpassing those of the flesh and to be dangerously addictive; once tried, it was hard to escape.

"Let's start," Yang Kai said solemnly.

Su Yan nodded softly.

They both activated the Dual Cultivation Technique. In the next instant their Spirit Bodies dissolved into points of light that dispersed throughout the stone chamber; those lights wound around one another, indistinguishable, pursuing and entwining, and faintly a decadent sound echoed between heaven and earth.

Yang Kai was intoxicated; he felt as if he had fallen into a honey jar, unable to free himself. The comfort and delight that flooded his body and mind sent him soaring — the exhilaration was almost beyond description.

Though there was no physical contact, the pleasure truly matched the legends and exceeded them manyfold.

He could sense Su Yan's soul wrapped around him; the contact and collision of their souls left both of them somewhat unable to restrain themselves.

Each penetrated into the other's soul depths, yet neither sought the other's hidden secrets; both had opened their hearts.

Both were utterly immersed in the sensation of soul fusion, experiencing joys that transcended the flesh.

During their soul fusion, subtle and pleasing changes were occurring in both of their Spirit Bodies.
