## Chapter 1676 — Haicheng City

One day later, the Space Array was fully repaired.

Yang Kai summoned Mo Yu and Yang Xiuzhu and the others, and took his leave from Qian Tong.

Yang Kai had no worries at all about Yingyue Hall. Now that Qian Tong had reached the Void King Realm, he could be called the greatest expert Dark Star had seen in tens of thousands of years. If even he couldn’t resolve Yingyue Hall’s crisis, then the entire Dark Star would likely be doomed.

“Brother Yang, take care on your journey,” Wei Guchang said, cupping his fist in farewell.

Yang Kai returned the salute.

“Yang Kai, which location does this Space Array connect to?” Mo Yu asked from the side.

“Hmm… if I'm not mistaken, it should connect to Demon Blood City!”

“What do you mean, ‘if you're not mistaken’?” Mo Yu said, taken aback.

Demon Blood City lay very close to the Flowing Flame Sandland and not far from Qiantian Sect, which was why Yang Kai had aimed the Space Array at that place—yet his way of putting it left Mo Yu feeling odd.

Yang Kai gave an embarrassed smile. “This is the first time I've set up a Space Array, so I can't guarantee it will transport us directly to Demon Blood City.”

Mo Yu was dumbstruck; Yang Xiuzhu and the others wore looks of speechless disbelief.

“But rest assured.” Yang Kai read their expressions and knew what they feared. “Even if it isn't anchored on Demon Blood City, the teleportation itself won't be dangerous—this I can guarantee.”

Hearing him say this, everyone finally relaxed.

Teleportation through a Space Array was an exceedingly delicate matter—any slightest error could result in being banished into the endless void, never to return. Over the years, many such incidents had occurred on Dark Star: whenever a Space Array malfunctioned, those being transmitted either vanished without a trace or were directly torn to pieces by the chaotic spatial forces.

So when they heard Yang Kai's earlier words, everyone had been tense.

But since Yang Kai could guarantee this trip would be safe, there was nothing more to worry about.

Even if the destination was wrong, it was no great matter—at worst they'd travel overland by Star Shuttle.

“It's getting late, let's set out.” Yang Xiuzhu could not wait to return to the Lingxiao Sect to see how things stood.

They all nodded and stood upon the Space Array; Yang Kai took the central position and drew upon Saint Yuan to thread the whole formation. In an instant the Saint Crystal seated in the array flared with blinding light as vast reserves of energy were drawn away.

A surge of Spatial Force rolled through, and the group vanished.

“Destroy the array first. Do not let anyone teleport in from outside!” After Yang Kai and his party disappeared, Qian Tong waved his hand.

Wei Guchang obeyed. He sent a fist crashing into the formation foundation Yang Kai had painstakingly reassembled; the foundation split cleanly in two and the array was rendered unusable.

Qian Tong's gaze swept like a blade. He stared into the distance and said in a low voice, “Return to Yingyue Hall!”

Fei Zhi Tu, Wei Guchang and the others were shaken, turning toward Yingyue Hall; the eyes of each showed a terrible murderous intent.

…

In the void, a flash of light flickered—and Yang Kai and the others appeared out of nowhere in a strange and sudden manifestation.

A handful of them, aside from Yang Kai, felt dizzy and only gradually recovered after some time. Long-distance spatial transfers often brought such side effects—only Yang Kai, who had trained in Spatial Force, could adjust his condition in the shortest time.

Luckily there was no immediate danger nearby, or else they would have been caught off guard.

Yang Xiuzhu turned and exclaimed, “This isn't Demon Blood City—where are we?”

They had emerged on a vast plain; as far as the eye could see there was no trace of any city.

The teleportation had indeed gone awry.

Yang Kai had prepared himself mentally and felt no shame. He said, “We should be somewhere between Demon Blood City and Tianyun City. Do any of you recognize this plain?”

Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi and Lin Yurao all slowly shook their heads; they did not recognize it.

Although native to the Dark Star, they had spent long years in seclusion on Star Emperor Mountain cultivating and were unfamiliar with the outside world; they knew even less than Yang Kai, so asking them to deduce things now was asking a lot.

Mo Yu's eyes brightened; he scanned the area with joy, flew high to scout, and returned a moment later, visibly excited.

“I know where this is. This is White Bone Plain; nearby is the Heaven-Splitting Gorge, and Haicheng City is only a day's journey from here.”

“Oh? Haicheng City of the Qiantian Sect?” Yang Kai was a little surprised.

“That's right!”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. The teleportation error was not terribly far off, and for Mo Yu this might even be fortunate; Haicheng City belonged to the Qiantian Sect and was not too distant from the sect's main headquarters—much like the relationship between Tianyun City and Yingyue Hall.

That coincidence had proven beneficial to Mo Yu.

“Then let's go to Haicheng City first.” Yang Kai pondered for a moment; he urgently needed to learn the situation around the Lingxiao Sect, and Haicheng City was unquestionably the best place to start.

Moreover, the situation in Haicheng City was still unknown, so he naturally intended to accompany Mo Yu there to investigate—perhaps there would be some way he could lend his aid.

After all, it was on the way.

“Then thank you.” Mo Yu hastily cupped his fist.

This was Qiantian Sect territory and Mo Yu was intimately familiar with it. He led them flying, and after roughly a day's effort a towering city rose up on the plain ahead.

“That's Haicheng City!” Mo Yu pointed out in introduction.

“There seems to be a battle.” Yang Kai noticed many secret techniques and Secret Treasures flaring with light.

“They are people of Qiantian Sect!” Mo Yu's face darkened and he quickened his pace.

Fighting near Haicheng City was neither wholly bad nor wholly good news; at least the city had not been seized by the Corpse Spirit Sect and someone was still resisting—how the situation truly stood remained unknown.

On the walls of Haicheng City stood a beautiful woman, her face pale. Around her gathered more than a dozen Origin Returning Realm experts, though their condition looked far from good—each bore injuries, some light and some grave. One among them was in especially dire shape, his right arm completely severed and freshly so; white bandages wrapped the stump, still seeping blood that stained the cloth a deep red.

The warrior endured with grim resolve—though the pain was excruciating, he ground his teeth and remained silent.

Below the walls, Corpse Spirits with white, green, or red fur ran rampant, clashing with human warriors.

The scene was chaotic; both sides numbered at least thousands, and the human forces were far from unified—many even aided the Corpse Spirits in slaughtering their own countrymen.

Those people had clearly betrayed and joined the Corpse Spirit Sect.

“City Lord, order them to return—if this drags on they'll all be dead.” On the wall someone cupped his fist at the fair woman, his face full of grief.

This was a completely unfair fight; the enemy outnumbered them by ten to one, and Haicheng City's warriors each had to contend with many opponents.

Six hundred charged out; within less than a quarter of an hour only two hundred remained, desperately holding the line, and even those were stretched to the breaking point.

“Yes, City Lord, these are the Qiantian Sect's last elites; if they fall here, how will we answer our ancestors?” someone said, full of anguish.

“We cannot retreat!” the beautiful woman shouted coldly. “Haicheng City’s defensive array is still under repair—if we withdraw now, the city will have no power to resist. Once the Corpse Spirit Sect’s army arrives, all within Haicheng City will be slaughtered without mercy!”

“We know that, but…” the previous speaker replied, grief-stricken.

Those six hundred elites had charged only to buy time for the city's arrays to be mended; it was a sacrifice of lives. Haicheng City had held thus far thanks to its many restrictions and grand formations—without them the Corpse Spirit Sect's army would have long since razed the place.

But holding on had reached its limit; the Corpse Spirit Sect needed only to muster one more powerful assault and the walls would likely fall.

Given the Corpse Spirit Sect's customary brutality, when that time came there would likely be few among Haicheng City's one million residents left alive.

“Damn Wild Wind Pavilion, Everchanging Sect, No-Trace Sect—those scoundrels who used to fawn over the Qiantian Sect now willingly serve the Corpse Spirits and slaughter our disciples. If I survive, I will see their blood repaid for blood!” someone shouted in fury.

The expressions of the others were grim.

Wild Wind Pavilion, Everchanging Sect, No-Trace Sect… these small sects and families had once been subordinate to the Qiantian Sect; when the Qiantian Sect was strong they flattered and fawned, practically begging to be its servants.

The Qiantian Sect had treated these subordinate forces generously, even allowing them to cultivate certain sect secret techniques, and each year had accepted their elite disciples for training under the sect's experts.

Yet after the upheaval on the Dark Star those treacherous rogues had actively surrendered; not only did they betray the Qiantian Sect, they even launched a surprise attack on the sect's main headquarters.

In that battle the Qiantian Sect's main headquarters was destroyed; only a few escaped. Within a radius spanning ten to ten thousand li of influence, only Haicheng City stubbornly held on.

The fair city lord said nothing, but the grief in her eyes was plain to see.

How many people can remain true under such overwhelming evil? She felt no anger—those who chose to live by cowardice had lost the very core of being human.

“Shen Shitao, where are you!” the fair woman suddenly called.

Not far off, a graceful woman with peach-blossom eyes hurried to her side and cupped her fist, “Elder Du, I am here!”

At other times such a woman would have been the focus of many a man's fancy, but now few had leisure for such thoughts.

The fair woman spoke with authority, “Shen Shitao, I order you to select three hundred from the Qiantian Sect's younger generation and, with them, pass through the Space Array to leave Haicheng City at once!”

Shen Shitao was stunned, but being gentle and sensible she immediately understood the elder's intent. Her face went pale as she cried out, “Elder Du!”

The fair woman smiled kindly. “Our Qiantian Sect's main headquarters was destroyed and the Sect Master killed. Those remaining in Haicheng City are the last bloodline of our sect; you must lead those three hundred and survive at all costs—only if you live will the Qiantian Sect have a future and hope!”
