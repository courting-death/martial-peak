## Chapter 1033 — It Would Be Rude To Refuse

Yang Kai could not imagine how the helmsman of a power could possibly manage several cultivation stars, let alone more; he likely had no time to cultivate at all—merely dealing with all manner of affairs would keep his schedule packed to the brim.

“Layered management,” Shen Tu said with a smile as he explained, “the high level manages the middle level, the middle manages the low, each level answers to the one above—how could it fail to be managed? The superiors need not personally handle every matter.”

Once Shen Tu explained it, Yang Kai immediately realized he had asked a foolish question and fell silent in embarrassment.

If one is not in that position, one should not meddle in those affairs. He had not reached such heights, so it seemed odd to him, yet people always strive upward while water flows downward; every living thing claws and scrambles upward.

Beasts have beast kings, empires have monarchs; they stand on the summit and enjoy a different view, and they have the power to govern their clans and empires—those were not his concerns.

An hour later, not far ahead they came upon a cluster of buildings occupying a considerable area, and Shen Tu signaled Yang Kai to descend toward them.

The architectures were bizarre and varied, forms Yang Kai had never seen before—some like spires, some like towering edifices hundreds of zhang tall, clustered together.

“Here, centered on this spot, within three thousand li is my territory.” Shen Tu jumped down from the Star Shuttle, spread his arms, inhaled the air exaggeratedly, and wore the expression of someone delighted to be home.

Yang Kai and Bi Ya also retracted their Star Shuttles and landed to his sides, looking around.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and made a slight probe. He discovered there were roughly several hundred martial practitioners gathered here, their cultivation levels uneven—some were not very high, only at the Divine Roaming and Transcendent Realm thresholds, and even some at the True Yuan Realm—but a few of them gave off formidable auras, no weaker at all than Yue Xi and Lü Guichen.

Those were Saint King Realm experts!

Yang Kai understood then that although there were countless experts scattered across the star domain, each of those experts had climbed step by step. Every one of them had once passed through the Open Origin, Qi Movement, Separation and Union, True Yuan, and Divine Roaming stages...

Cultivating footstep by footstep, breaking through layers of restraints and shackles, they had obtained their proud and mighty prowess.

However, those who could break free from the confinement of cultivation stars and venture deep into the Starry Sky were, at minimum, of Saint Realm caliber, so everyone Yang Kai met in the starry expanse was strong.

Martial practitioners below Saint Realm, even with the Star Shuttle’s protection, would not dare expose their flesh in the Starry Sky.

The merciless force of the Starry Sky would shred them to pieces; they must hide within warships to guarantee their safety.

Perhaps stirred by the arrival of the three of them, a middle-aged man in black combat attire drifted out from within. When he saw Shen Tu his face brightened and he called out, “Young Master Shen Tu, you’ve returned?”

“I have.” Shen Tu nodded lightly and grinned, “Nothing happened here while I was away, did it?”

The middle-aged man shook his head. “Nothing much, but Chairman Ai Ou came looking for you half a year ago because you disappeared without warning and was furious for a time.”

Shen Tu’s expression changed slightly and he drew his neck in. “Father came looking for me? Did he say anything?”

The middle-aged man replied, “He didn’t say much, only that you should go meet him as soon as you returned.”

Shen Tu’s face went sour as he murmured, “It’s over, it’s over—there’s no avoiding a beating now.”

As they spoke, Yang Kai read their expressions and knew the middle-aged man and the hidden experts within were likely sent by the Hengluo Commerce Guild to protect Shen Tu—they were his subordinates.

The middle-aged man glanced at Yang Kai and Bi Ya casually; he showed little reaction toward Yang Kai, but his look toward Bi Ya was plainly one of disgust.

He seemed to have judged at a glance that Bi Ya was a promiscuous woman, thinking Shen Tu had been ensnared and bewitched by her.

“Young Master, who are these two…” the middle-aged man asked, looking at Yang Kai and Bi Ya.

“Oh, this brother is Yang Kai!” Shen Tu drew Yang Kai close, slung an arm over his shoulder affectionately, and grandly introduced, “He is the sworn brother I made during my travels—Uncle Jia Long, treat him as my benefactor.”

Jia Long’s face turned solemn. Without asking more, he cupped his fist to Yang Kai in salute. “Thanks to you, Young Brother, for looking after our Young Master while he was away. He is headstrong by nature; I’m sure he caused you trouble. Please forgive him.”

“You’re too polite, I merely helped Shen Tu,” Yang Kai replied with a modest smile.

Jia Long nodded slightly, satisfaction showing in his eyes.

“This woman…” Shen Tu pointed at Bi Ya, “originally from Purple Star, now wants to join our guild for work—Uncle Jia Long, find a position for her.”

“From Purple Star?” Jia Long frowned. “Her strength seems a bit low…”

“If I can seclude for a while I can breakthrough to the Saint King Realm within half a month!” Bi Ya hurriedly said, seeming eager for shelter.

“Breakthrough to Saint King Realm in half a month?” Jia Long’s thick brows rose. “If she truly reaches Saint King Realm, the guild can accept her. For now, let her seclude and cultivate here.”

Saying so, he clapped his hands and a guard standing nearby immediately stepped forward.

“Take this girl to the private chamber; give her some Saint Crystals and pills.” Jia Long ordered.

“Yes.”

“Thank you, Young Master Shen Tu, thank you Lord Jia Long.” Bi Ya’s face brightened as she bowed to Shen Tu and then looked at Yang Kai. “Until we meet again.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

After Bi Ya was taken away, Shen Tu warmly escorted Yang Kai into the residence.

The middle-aged martial artist Jia Long trotted closely behind.

Guards and maidservants they passed bowed on bended knee to greet them respectfully.

“Brother, I’ll go bathe and change; you can tidy yourself up—let’s talk later.” Once inside, Shen Tu said casually, “Don’t treat yourself as an outsider here.”

“Alright.” Yang Kai followed his host’s lead.

Shen Tu chuckled and put his arm around two young girls, leering as he strode inward.

“This way, Young Master!” Another maidlike woman approached, her beautiful eyes darting, her figure graceful; she smiled and guided Yang Kai ahead.

Following her, Yang Kai threaded through the halls of the residence.

Although Shen Tu claimed to be Chairman Ai Ou’s illegitimate son and never publicly acknowledged it, from his personnel and the territory he occupied, it was clear Shen Tu’s standing in Ai Ou’s heart was not insignificant.

Otherwise he would not have been provided with Saint King Realm guards as bodyguards, nor would he be granted three thousand li of territory.

Yang Kai had no interest in meddling in others’ affairs; he strolled along with the maid and entered a massive inner chamber.

Within the chamber a large bed draped with pink curtains exuded a warm atmosphere.

The room smelled of flowers. In its center sat a huge bath carved from white jade, filled with steaming hot water and shrouded in mist.

The bath was strewn with colorful petals; nearby stood several girls wearing revealing gauze, and when Yang Kai entered they smiled and bowed lightly toward him.

The mist swirled around them, giving them a hazy allure.

The steam had dampened their thin veils, clinging to their tempting forms—those glimpses of beauty quickened the blood.

Yang Kai was taken aback—he had not expected such a sight awaiting him—and his breathing grew heavy as his gaze roved over the young maidens.

They all looked quite young, each fresh and spirited, their snow-white skin blushing a tantalizing rose; their appearance outstanding, each with differing temperaments, all wearing smiles and postures that could enthrall any man.

Yang Kai’s gaze swept over them; some met it boldly, eyes smoldering with heat, while others turned bashful, hurriedly trying to cover the alluring curves of their chests and lower bodies — shy yet faintly inviting all the same…

Shen Tu’s life was shockingly lewd and decadent…

Yang Kai could not help but grumble inwardly.

“Young Master, would you like me to help you change?” the maid who led him in asked softly with an enchanting smile; seeing Yang Kai frozen, she spoke with gentle concern.

Yang Kai pulled his gaze back and shook his head, asking, “Did your Young Master arrange this?”

“Yes, I was instructed,” the maid replied, “but it was also at the Young Master’s earlier behest. You are the honored guest he brought back, so I received you with the highest standard. You are the second to enjoy this honor.”

“Oh? There was another before me?”

“Yes.” The maid nodded. “But rest assured, these sisters are unblemished—pure white jade, never defiled. They are happy to serve Young Master Shen Tu’s honored guests.”

“Why would they be happy?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Because Young Master Shen Tu has been kind to them; they volunteered to be maidservants—no one forced them to do anything. I consulted them before arranging this.”

Yang Kai met the maidens’ gazes again and saw they did not look unwilling; he believed the maid was telling the truth.

“Are you dissatisfied? If so, I can summon others; I’m sure we can find someone suitable.”

“No need.” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Then you—”

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then grinned. “Forget it—since Shen Tu’s offering out of good will, I’d be rude to refuse.”

Saying so, he calmly stripped and stepped into the bath.

The women at the edge of the pool beamed and leaped in, like mermaids, gliding elegantly to Yang Kai’s side and pressing their enticing forms against his skin, baring their charms while attentively assisting his bath.
