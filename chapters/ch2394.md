## Chapter 2394 — If You Want It, Come Take It

After Yang Kai put away the Bihai Shuttle into his Spatial Ring, he finally stood up.

Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi had been waiting for quite some time already. Yang Kai didn’t bother to ask about Sangde’s fate—since the two of them, along with a Heavenly Puppet, had chased after Sangde, it would be a joke if he’d managed to escape.

In fact, Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi only needed half a cup of tea’s time to finish off Sangde. With the rest of their time, the two women even managed to search the small island and take anything of value.

After retrieving Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi into the Xuan Realm Pearl, Yang Kai finally left the underground, summoned his wooden boat, and flew straight toward Tongtian Island.

Others in this Jixu Secret Realm would never dare to do this, because flying like this consumed too much Origin Qi, and replenishing it was extremely troublesome. So, no matter which cultivator went out to sea, they always used a multi-deck ship. The multi-deck ship wasn’t slow and saved Origin Qi.

Yang Kai wasn’t worried about this. He had countless Source Crystals and the Xuan Realm Pearl. Even if his Origin Qi was exhausted, he could just hide in the Xuan Realm Pearl and cultivate for a while to recover.

Now that the Bihai Shuttle was in hand, if he wanted to find the exit, Yang Kai could only seek out either the Ice Heart Pavilion Master or the Tongtian Island Master for information.

Yang Kai didn’t really want to deal with the Tongtian Island Master, but as for the Ice Heart Pavilion Master, there might be a chance to meet her. At this moment, Yang Kai felt a bit fortunate that he’d visited Ice Heart Pavilion before coming to this small island and applied to be one of their alchemists.

Now, he was in a favorable position, but the Ice Heart Pavilion Master was, after all, a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert—not someone he could just meet at will. Even if he did, working with such an expert to leave would require the utmost caution.

The journey was smooth, and in just three days, Yang Kai had already returned to the dock at Tongtian Island.

Many cultivators at the dock saw that he’d actually flown all the way back and couldn’t help but look over in surprise, secretly astonished. They wondered what Yang Kai had encountered at sea, to return without a multi-deck ship or companions.

Yang Kai ignored those strange looks and walked straight into Tongtian City.

Arriving at the entrance of his rented cave mansion, Yang Kai took out his token to open the barrier. As soon as he stepped inside, his body suddenly froze. Instinctively sensing something was wrong, he raised his hand and struck at the void, Origin Qi surging violently within him.

Boom—a loud explosion rang out, and the cave mansion shook violently, the lights of various barriers flickering wildly.

Under the assault of a tremendous force, Yang Kai was sent flying like a ragged sack, spitting out a mouthful of blood in midair before crashing heavily to the ground.

Emperor Realm!

Yang Kai’s eyes filled with shock. He never expected that there would be an Emperor Realm expert lying in ambush in his own cave mansion! Although the other party was only First Stage Emperor Realm and hadn’t used their full strength with that strike, Yang Kai was caught off guard and still suffered a significant loss.

He hurriedly got up, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and glared angrily to the side.

Over there, a man’s face was full of surprise and suspicion, as if he hadn’t expected his sneak attack to fail to capture Yang Kai on the spot, and instead let him escape. For some reason, the man’s face was pale, clearly already seriously injured.

“Pang Guang!” Upon seeing the man’s face clearly, Yang Kai immediately gritted his teeth and shouted.

The one who had ambushed him in his own cave mansion was none other than Pang Guang, the City Lord of Gao City, who had entered together with him!

A few days ago, before Yang Kai left Tongtian City, he’d accidentally bumped into Pang Guang on the street. At the time, they’d just brushed past each other, neither greeting the other. Who would have thought they’d meet again under such circumstances?

Shifting his gaze, Yang Kai’s expression darkened, murderous intent surging in his heart.

Because at this moment, Pang Guang had one hand hovering over Liu Qianyun’s head, power gathering in his palm, ready to take her life at any moment!

Yang Kai didn’t know why Pang Guang was here or how he’d managed to capture Liu Qianyun, but the current situation left him extremely constrained.

With her life in Pang Guang’s grasp, Liu Qianyun trembled, her pretty face drained of color. Seeing Yang Kai injured, she couldn’t help but cry out, “Senior Brother…” Her beautiful eyes were full of concern and unease, as well as deep guilt and self-blame.

A few days ago, when Yang Kai left Tongtian City, he’d asked if she wanted to go with him, but Liu Qianyun had chosen to stay. Now it seemed that decision was a mistake—if she’d gone with Yang Kai, she wouldn’t have been taken hostage and used to threaten him.

She’d only gone out briefly the day before yesterday, not far, just to visit Ling Yinqin and the others’ cave mansion to get familiar with the route, thinking that since they’d be neighbors, they could visit more often in the future.

But on her way back, she was targeted by Pang Guang and subdued as soon as she entered the cave mansion.

“I’m fine!” Yang Kai spat out a mouthful of blood with a defiant air and looked at Liu Qianyun. “He didn’t do anything to you, did he?”

Liu Qianyun slowly shook her head. “No, he was just waiting for you to come back!”

Yang Kai finally relaxed, then turned a cold gaze to Pang Guang and said in a deep voice, “City Lord Pang, isn’t this a bit dishonorable?”

Pang Guang snorted coldly, looking somewhat uncomfortable. For an Emperor Realm expert like him to sneak into someone’s cave mansion and take a much weaker woman hostage—if word got out, it would indeed sound disgraceful.

“Boy, I won’t beat around the bush with you,” Pang Guang said in a low voice, his breath a bit weak. “This Lord is here for one reason only—hand over your Butian Lotus, and I’ll let her go and leave immediately.”

Pang Guang had known Yang Kai possessed the Butian Lotus back in Gao City, and he also knew how precious it was. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have secretly followed Yang Kai and Yao Changjun. He’d originally planned to fish in troubled waters, but ended up swept into the Great Jixu Whirlpool and brought to this Jixu Secret Realm.

“You want the Butian Lotus?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, looking Pang Guang up and down, and immediately realized something. He grinned, “City Lord Pang, is it your Dantian that’s damaged, or your Divine Soul?”

The Butian Lotus’s effect was to repair damaged Dantian and Divine Soul. Yao Changjun had tried to seize it because his Divine Soul was injured, and now Pang Guang wanted it for the same reason.

No wonder this guy looked weak, as if he’d been hurt. He must have fought with some expert and gotten injured. Even though he was a First Stage Emperor in Tongtian City, recovering from such serious wounds wasn’t easy—there were no great alchemists or good Spiritual Pills here.

Fortunately, he knew Yang Kai had the Butian Lotus, so he set his sights on him.

He’d thought that even injured, it would be easy to ambush and capture Yang Kai, but things hadn’t gone as planned. Yang Kai’s quick reactions and counterattack had prevented him from succeeding at once, so now he could only rely on his hostage.

“This has nothing to do with you! Hand over the Butian Lotus, and I, Pang, swear not to make things difficult for you!” Pang Guang shouted impatiently.

Yang Kai sneered, “City Lord Pang, looks like things aren’t going well for you. That’s right—an Emperor suddenly appearing on Tongtian Island, everyone must know you’re new here, and you probably have a lot of good stuff on you. You got robbed, didn’t you?”

Unlike him, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun had quietly entered Tongtian Island, so as long as they had the right identity tokens, no one would know they were newcomers. But Pang Guang couldn’t hide it—there were only a few Emperor Realm experts on the island, so a new face was obviously a newcomer.

“Enough nonsense, I want the Butian Lotus!” Pang Guang growled, his grip growing unsteady, his expression showing how desperate he was.

Liu Qianyun immediately cried out, her face contorted in pain.

“If you so much as lay a finger on my Junior Sister, I swear you’ll leave here dead!” Yang Kai roared, his voice thunderous with fury.

“That depends on whether you cooperate!” Beads of sweat began to form on Pang Guang’s forehead, clearly showing how badly he was hurt.

“The Butian Lotus, right?” Yang Kai’s face darkened. With a flip of his hand, he said, “Take a look at this!”

Pang Guang immediately looked at his palm, his eyes blazing with desire. There it was—the Butian Lotus, pure white and spotless. As soon as Yang Kai took it out, a faint fragrance filled the cave mansion, refreshing Pang Guang’s spirit and even easing his injuries a bit.

“Give it to me! Give it to me!” Pang Guang shouted anxiously. With the Butian Lotus, his injuries could quickly heal, and he wouldn’t have to worry about any lingering effects that might harm his Martial Dao foundation in the future.

Yang Kai let out a cold laugh, and under Pang Guang’s stunned gaze, stuffed the Butian Lotus straight into his mouth, chewing it up like a cow eating peonies, his face showing an expression of utter ecstasy, as if savoring a peerless delicacy.

Munch, munch…

Pang Guang was dumbfounded, frozen in place as if hit by a petrification spell.

While eating, Yang Kai laughed maniacally, “You want it? Come and take it! See if I’ll spit out a mouthful for you to taste!”

“You…” Pang Guang was so furious that his Qi and blood surged, nearly making him faint, his face turning white with rage.

He clearly had a hostage, yet Yang Kai still dared to act so recklessly. Was this kid insane? Did he really not care about his Junior Sister’s life at all?

Just as Pang Guang was lost in wild thoughts, Yang Kai’s left eye suddenly turned into a golden vertical pupil. As the golden pupil contracted, a strange power spread out.

Pang Guang was momentarily dazed, his Divine Soul suddenly destabilized, as if affected by something.

At that moment, Yang Kai summoned the Myriad Sword, his body wrapped in sword light, surging with unstoppable momentum as he slashed toward Pang Guang.

The sword intent was chilling. Even before the sword arrived, a wave of deathly aura rushed straight at him.

Pang Guang instinctively took a step back.

But in the next instant, his heart lurched as he realized Yang Kai’s intention. Gritting his teeth, Origin Qi surged in his palm as he struck down, trying to kill Liu Qianyun before Yang Kai could reach him, to show him the consequences of provoking him.

But to his shock, his grasp caught nothing but air.

The Liu Qianyun who had been under his control suddenly vanished without a trace, not even leaving a hint of movement. Only a strange fluctuation of power remained, as Liu Qianyun was inexplicably moved several zhang away, narrowly escaping that fatal blow.
