## Chapter 575 — Headlong Into the Fire Pit

Elder Huang Xiao of the Huang Family was naturally inclined to think this way; it was hardly surprising. Qiu Yimeng did not wish to explain too much to him.

Throughout the world, only Yang Kai’s mansion was currently the safest refuge.

“Elder Huang, rumors... are not always to be trusted,” Lü Si suddenly interjected, seemingly defending Yang Kai.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe of Guangming Mansion looked at him with surprise, somewhat puzzled as to why he would say such a thing.

Lü Si said, “I’ve dealt with Young Master Yang before. I dare guarantee that he is no treacherous man, though admittedly, he is indeed cunning!”

He was clearly still nursing a grudge over the time Yang Kai came as a guest in the Lü Family and took the Yang Crystal Jade Bed he used to meditate on.

Though it was also due to Yang Kai’s involvement that he obtained a Mystery Grade Pill from Xiao Fusheng, resolving his troubles of many years, that Yang Crystal Jade Bed was a prized possession after all.

“Elder Lü flatters me,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

“Elder Lü says he has no collusion with demonic forces?” Huang Xiao snorted coldly. “Very well, I know your eyesight well, Elder Lü, so I believe your words. But how do you explain what’s happening here?”

His question was directed at Yang Kai.

“What do I need to explain to you?” Yang Kai sneered inwardly, finding Huang Xiao quite amusing. Despite having accepted the summons of the Eight Great Families, he didn’t rush to aid Zhongdu. Instead, he fixated on quarreling here, as if bound to some endless strife.

It was utterly incomprehensible.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and roughly understood why he acted this way.

Zhongdu was indeed dangerous. Huang Xiao probably wasn’t willing to go there and, having encountered trouble on the way, naturally wanted to create complications to delay his journey. If he could accomplish a major feat here, he might win favor upon reaching Zhongdu, which would greatly benefit both himself and the Huang Family.

At the very least, he would avoid being sacrificed as a vanguard by the Eight Great Families.

Using me as a pawn? Yang Kai’s mind sharpened, full of displeasure.

“If Young Master Yang does not wish to explain, so be it,” Huang Xiao nodded faintly, then pointed at Shan Qingluo. “Capture this enchantress, strip her of her cultivation, and I shall believe you have no collusion with Cangyun Evil Land. How about that?”

“Who the hell do you think you are?” Yang Kai laughed. It was clear Huang Xiao intended to pick a fight with him.

To those leading their elite troops to aid Zhongdu, Yang Kai held some respect; after all, their hearts were for the world’s greater good.

But Huang Xiao’s reckless provocation grated on Yang Kai’s nerves, especially since his motives were not as straightforward as they appeared.

“So it is. Elder Lü, what say you now?” Huang Xiao turned his gaze to Lü Si.

Lü Si sighed lightly and shook his head, remaining silent. Huang Xiao had already decided Yang Kai colluded with demonic forces, so nothing he said could change his mind. Besides, Lü Si somewhat understood Huang Xiao’s intent.

Recently, the Lü Family, Huang Family, and Guangming Mansion had converged with their elite forces. Although their advance was not slow, they deliberately delayed, hoping for some twist in the battle for Zhongdu.

Everyone wished to encounter an event or situation on the road. However, nothing had occurred; they were nearly at Zhongdu when suddenly they found Yang Kai and the Enchantress Queen in War City. Of course, this must be made a big deal.

“Brother Lü, Brother Jiang, Cangyun Evil Land has brought chaos to the world. An evil king appears here; we cannot stand idly by,” Huang Xiao suddenly declared loudly.

Lü Si was startled: “Brother Huang, what do you intend?”

“Intend? Of course, to wipe this place clean, capture the enchantress and the Yang Family traitor collaborating with demons, and send them to Zhongdu for the Eight Great Families’ judgment!”

Hearing such wild claims, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, a strange expression crossing his face.

It wasn’t just Yang Kai; everyone who had rushed out upon hearing this displayed odd, astonished looks, staring at Huang Xiao.

Yang Kai’s mansion... how could these people possibly conquer it? Were they unaware of the power concealed within?

Even the eight from Fengshen Hall who once attacked had found no way to best Yang Kai’s mansion. Where did Huang Xiao get such confidence?

Upon reflection, everyone understood.

Half a year ago, the coalition of the Seven Great Families launched a strong offensive. Eight Transcendent Realm warriors of Fengshen Hall fought three Transcendent Realm defenders of Yang Kai’s mansion. All of War City witnessed it, but the next day, Cangyun Evil Land launched a massive invasion.

The city was left devastated; besides Yang Kai’s mansion, no survivors remained. The night’s battle news never leaked out.

Thus Huang Xiao believed this was merely the residence of a Yang Family scion involved in the Succession War.

A mansion of a Yang Family scion, no matter how many followers, how deep could its foundation be? This time, Huang Family brought their elite troops, including Transcendent Realm experts in command.

In Huang Xiao’s eyes, as long as they could deal with Shan Qingluo, taking this place would be a breeze.

“Brother Huang, do not be rash. This matter requires careful deliberation,” Lü Si warned urgently. The Lü Family had suffered losses during the Succession War by misjudging people and not following Yang Kai. Lü Si highly regarded Yang Kai and wished to avoid conflict.

Realizing the gravity of Huang Xiao’s proposal, Lü Si understood the risk.

“Brother Lü,” Huang Xiao looked at Lü Si with disappointment. “I don’t know what worries you, but you are overthinking. Capturing the enchantress and this Yang Family traitor would be a great achievement. Such an opportunity is right before us. Are you really going to let it slip away?”

He then turned to Jiang Zhe of Guangming Mansion and asked solemnly, “Brother Jiang, what do you think?”

Jiang Zhe nodded eagerly, “I will stand with Brother Huang to the end!”

Huang Xiao laughed heartily, “Brother Jiang is agreeable. Since Brother Lü declines, the credit will be shared between our two families.”

“Excellent!” Jiang Zhe nodded slightly.

They both looked as though they were certain to capture Yang Kai’s mansion and take Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo to Zhongdu to claim glory.

Qiu Yimeng’s expression hardened as she sharply said, “Sirs, why must you be so aggressive? Our mansion has no grievance with you two.”

Huang Xiao shook his head, “Miss Qiu, you’ve been deceived by treacherous people. No need to speak for them. Rest assured, we will not harm you. The Huang Family and Guangming Mansion only seek to capture the enchantress and the Yang Family traitor.”

“You lack the power for that; I suggest you withdraw quickly. If you delay, you might not be able to leave at all,” Qiu Yimeng said anxiously, watching Yang Kai’s expression as she shouted out.

She truly did not want to see the elites of the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion thrown headfirst into the fire. After all, they were on their way to aid Zhongdu. If they were lost here, their presence was meaningless.

Qiu Yimeng knew well Yang Kai’s temper. Huang Xiao’s repeated insult calling him a Yang Family traitor only fueled his anger. If this continued, Yang Kai might really kill someone.

“We can't leave?” Huang Xiao laughed loudly. “We never planned to leave.”

“Qiu Yimeng, step back,” Yang Kai said calmly.

“Yang Kai!” Qiu Yimeng grabbed his arm and shook her head, signaling him not to act rashly.

“I won’t strike first, but if they seek death, I cannot stop them!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“Bold words!” Huang Xiao flew into a rage, glared darkly, and looked over at Lü Si, “Brother Lü, this is my last question to you: will you join this action? If not, the credit belongs to Brother Jiang and me, with no share for the Lü Family!”

Lü Si hesitated, struggling mentally for a long moment before taking several steps back, signaling his stance.

He felt uneasy—something was wrong, and major unforeseen events might unfold.

Seeing Lü Si withdraw, Huang Xiao sneered secretly, thinking Lü Si far too timid.

Though Yang Kai was a true heir of the Yang Family, his collusion with demons and attempt to sow chaos in Zhongdu had spread far and wide six months ago. Now, seeing his close relationship with the Enchantress Queen, it was undoubtedly true he had fallen into the demonic path.

Capturing him here would not offend the Yang Family but bring enormous benefit.

Lü Si’s failure to seize this opportunity earned Huang Xiao’s disdain for his neutrality.

“As such, Brother Jiang, let us proceed,” Huang Xiao sneered, raised his hand slowly, and commanded, “All members of the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion, follow me to capture the enchantress and the Yang Family traitor. Except for Miss Qiu, show no mercy to any resistance!”

At his command, the forces of the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion surged toward Yang Kai’s mansion. Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe led the charge, their momentum overwhelming as they headed straight for Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo.

Yang Kai remained composed, standing his ground.

Beside him, Qiu Yimeng’s face was bleak as she watched the fierce oncoming crowd.

“I’m not giving them a chance; they chose to bring their deaths upon themselves!” Yang Kai said calmly to Qiu Yimeng.

She had no strength left to reply and turned her head, unable to watch. She could already foresee the fate of those attackers.

The Divine Roaming Realm experts of the Huang Family and Guangming Mansion drew ever closer, their murderous intent palpable.

“Kill them all! Show no mercy!” Yang Kai shouted coldly.

If others wouldn't be polite to him, neither would he be polite to them.

Suddenly, nine figures dashed out from behind him. Nine Blood Servants moved like thunder to meet the attackers — no flashy techniques, no powerful Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure, just raw recklessness, yet they struck like tigers among sheep.

Those who had come with high hopes were immediately halted as if a raging river was abruptly blocked, their momentum dissipating instantaneously.

A fierce wave of energy swept through, and in an instant, many fell.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe screamed as they were blasted flying backward.

From several dozen zhang away, Lü Si and his Lü Family companions stared wide-eyed, shocked beyond belief at this almost one-sided slaughter, their expressions deeply conflicted.

Nine Transcendent Realm warriors striking together left Lü Si breathless and unable to think.
