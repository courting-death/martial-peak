## Chapter 636 — The Coffin-Bearer

Inside the room light stretched endlessly; outside, Ruan Xinyu's face flushed crimson as she listened to that strange, mosquito-like whispering moan, her body tingling and trembling with awkwardness.

After a long while she realized that such eavesdropping was improper, and with a vexed sigh she muttered, "Youth cannot withstand temptation!"

Saying this, she hurried back into her room, plugged her ears, and held her breath to calm herself.

The night passed quickly. Ruan Xinyu, who lived next door to Yang Kai, had been thoroughly tormented; throughout that night the earth shook and mountains rolled, leaving her scarcely any peace.

Just before dawn the commotion next door gradually subsided. Ruan Xinyu could not help but exhale softly, steadying her heart, preparing to get some proper rest, when the ground suddenly trembled again.

"When will this end?" Ruan Xinyu felt like crying but had no tears; she truly had not expected that the two lovers next door possessed such stamina. Just as she spoke, she suddenly sensed something amiss.

This quaking differed greatly from the previous ones; accompanying the tremor was a hair-raising sensation that was rapidly approaching from afar.

Ruan Xinyu's expression changed at once and she darted outside.

The neighboring door creaked open; Yang Kai and Yun Xuan appeared simultaneously. The former wore an extremely grave expression, the latter a look of satisfaction, like a flower bathed in dew, more resplendent than before.

Ruan Xinyu glanced at her and could not help clicking her tongue in wonder, but said nothing more, turning her gaze again to the distant horizon.

Over there the sky had been dyed a blood-red, as if the firmament was splashed with clotted gore, a sight horribly fearsome, and that blood-red hue was spreading toward them at great speed.

The whole of Blazing Fire City hummed; countless cultivators who felt something amiss rose to investigate, their faces all changing drastically.

"What on earth is happening?" Ruan Xinyu asked, her brows slightly furrowed.

"Something is approaching this way!" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. Under the probing of his powerful Divine Sense he detected a very dangerous, violent, and evil aura; its intensity made his heart involuntarily palpitate with unease.

"What could possess such an aura?" Yun Xuan exclaimed in alarm.

"I don't know." Yang Kai shook his head.

From within the City Lord's mansion came the rustle of clothes—Ji Yan had evidently led the mansion's experts out and was rushing that way to investigate.

"I'll go take a look; you all stay here." Yang Kai was about to bolt out when Yun Xuan grabbed him: "Let us come; it's better to have someone watch your back."

Yang Kai frowned but said nothing further, allowing them to follow behind.

The three of them followed Ji Yan's group and sped off.

Before long they reached the city outskirts.

Many cultivators had already gathered outside Blazing Fire City; some in small groups, some in tens, all lingering outside and occupying the high ground, craning their necks to see what was happening in the distance.

Among them some were disciples of the Duao Alliance and many belonged to other factions; for various reasons they had stayed in Blazing Fire City and had happened upon today’s uproar.

Everyone whispered and pointed at the distant sky, guessing at the cause of the anomaly, but none could make sense of it.

Of those present, Ji Yan, possessing Transcendent Realm cultivation, was undoubtedly the strongest. He currently furrowed his brow, his Divine Sense sweeping back and forth probing the distance; after a moment his expression changed sharply and took on an odd pallor.

"City Lord Ji, what exactly is going on over there?" someone called out loudly to Ji Yan.

Ji Yan shook his head. "I don't know either, but there is surely danger. If you value your lives, leave this place at once."

Hearing this, some immediately used their movement skills to depart, but more chose to stay.

Often danger equaled opportunity; this inexplicable event might yield some benefit, and those with ulterior motives would not be deterred by Ji Yan's words.

Moreover, with so many gathered here, even if danger struck, escape might still be possible.

Seeing his warning had little effect, Ji Yan stopped urging and waited quietly.

As he watched, he suddenly spotted Yun Xuan and her companions and hastily beckoned to them.

Yun Xuan smiled faintly, spoke a word to Yang Kai and Ruan Xinyu, then flew over to join Ji Yan's mansion experts.

"Miss Yun, your injuries are not yet healed; it's better not to come out," Ji Yan said with concern.

"I'm nearly recovered, thank you for your concern, Uncle Ji," Yun Xuan said, pursing her lips in a small smile.

"Yes—by your looks you're certainly much better than a few days ago; you have more radiance about you," Ji Yan nodded with a faint smile.

"Heh…" Yun Xuan felt slightly embarrassed and explained, "It's all thanks to Xinyu's care."

Ruan Xinyu sneered beside them and secretly gave Yang Kai a sharp look.

"Is this your team member?" Ji Yan glanced at Yang Kai and nodded. "Young man, work hard; follow Miss Yun and you will one day achieve much. Don't disappoint her expectations."

Yang Kai gave no reply.

Yun Xuan, fearing Yang Kai might respond improperly, quickly changed the subject: "Uncle Ji, what is happening over there?"

Ji Yan looked around, lowered his voice and said, "I don't know the specifics, but judging by the display it is indeed dangerous. However, I sense many experts flying this way, trailing behind that evil aura."

It was precisely because he sensed those people that Ji Yan remained calm and composed.

Had the evil aura been alone, Ji Yan would have already begun evacuating Blazing Fire City's people, for its strength put him on edge.

"Trailing behind?" Yun Xuan repeated in surprise.

Ji Yan nodded slightly. "What puzzles me is that the two sides have not fought. Those trailing seem to be merely watching and waiting; the owner of the evil aura up ahead shows no sign of attacking. I cannot understand it."

He shook his head helplessly as he spoke.

Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu exchanged looks, also feeling the oddity.

Yang Kai remained composed and outwardly unruffled, which caused Ji Yan to view him with some newfound respect; he thought this disciple of Yun Xuan had decent temperament and potential.

As time passed, the blood-dyed hue bit away at the sky over Blazing Fire City, and the unsettling aura drew ever closer.

Soon a small dark speck came into view for everyone.

"What is that?" someone shouted.

"It seems to be a person?"

All eyes turned to that speck, but the light was still dim before dawn and the distance great, so no one could clearly make out what the figure was like.

Only behind that speck could one vaguely see dozens of experts following, many of whom emanated Transcendent Realm auras.

Ji Yan's expression grew even more solemn.

After a while the dark speck finally resolved into a clear figure. When Ji Yan saw his face he could not help but narrow his pupils and cried out, "The Coffin-Bearer?"

When Ji Yan spoke those three words, he immediately knew something was wrong.

Glancing around, he saw the cultivators gathered there all wearing expressions of intense excitement; each was itching to try, greedily staring up at the so‑called Coffin-Bearer in the sky.

Yun Xuan also looked astonished and asked anxiously, "Uncle Ji, is that the Coffin-Bearer from the legends?"

Ruan Xinyu puckered her lips in surprise, hardly believing she might one day see a figure who existed only in tales.

"It should be," Ji Yan said with a very ill expression; unlike those around him he looked grim. "That aura, that intensity—only he could possess it. I did not expect the Coffin-Bearer to appear again…"

Yang Kai listened to the others while raising his eyes to appraise the figure in the sky, suddenly understanding why he bore such a strange name.

For strapped to his back was a coffin—a huge blood-red coffin, grotesque and chilling—and from the Coffin-Bearer radiated waves of corpse-like qi.

The Coffin-Bearer himself was broad-waisted and heavily built, hulking to a degree Yang Kai had never seen; he seemed scarcely human, standing at least two zhang tall, muscles piled high across his body, yet his flesh was riddled with pustules and tumors, a terrifying shape with ferocious features; his gaping mouth revealed jagged fangs irregularly set, and he panted with heavy breaths.

His movements were sluggish; each step seemed to take much effort to form, yet each carried profound meaning, so despite the slowness his speed was exceedingly fast.

Yang Kai watched his gait secretly; after only a few glances he suddenly became dizzy and his vision blurred.

Ji Yan barked coldly, "Do not try to comprehend his martial path—it's not something you can understand."

Yang Kai's heart chilled; he nodded slightly.

Turning, he quietly asked Yun Xuan, "Is the Coffin-Bearer very famous?"

Yun Xuan stared at him in surprise, suddenly realizing this young man knew little of the outside world, and carefully explained, "He is a legend; his name is spread across the Tongxuan Continent. No one knows his origin or why he carries a blood-red coffin; because of his appearance people call him the Coffin-Bearer. This is my first time seeing him too. I heard that he appears once every ten years, and each time his appearance is in a different place—the east, south, west, and north of the Continent have all seen his footprints. But if it truly is him, there's no need to worry too much."

"Why?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"Because although the Coffin-Bearer is mighty and fearsome in appearance, he never attacks people."

"He never attacks people?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"Yes, it's strange—some rule seems to bind him. No one has ever seen him strike. Moreover, when the Coffin-Bearer appears, he can bring unexpected benefits."

"What kind of benefits?" Yang Kai grew interested.

"When he stops to rest at some place, if driven to desperation he will fling out many Secret Treasure, Martial Skill manuals, or miraculous pills and elixirs—things cultivators scramble for."
