## Chapter 2463 — Are You from Ice Heart Valley?

Before Yang Kai could get close, a surge of Imperial Aura suddenly rippled from that direction.

Yang Kai’s eyes bulged in surprise. “Another Imperial Treasure?”

When the Mountain and River Bell appeared earlier, he had sensed a similar energy fluctuation. Now, having just subdued the Mountain and River Bell, he encountered the same phenomenon again. He couldn’t help but marvel at how the Shattered Star Sea truly overflowed with treasures.

But soon, Yang Kai realized something was off.

The wave of Imperial Aura wasn’t the sign of an Imperial Treasure emerging, because the situation over there was completely different from when the Mountain and River Bell appeared. Not only that, but the sound of crackling thunder echoed from that direction, and terrifying Heaven-and-Earth might was gathering, manifesting the grandeur of the Heavenly Dao!

“A breakthrough!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he realized someone was about to ascend to the Emperor Realm.

His gaze was fixed on the nascent phenomenon forming in the distance, his heart surging with excitement. He’d long known that martial artists could break through to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea, but after two or three years inside, Yang Kai had yet to see anyone make that leap.

Now, at this very moment, someone was accomplishing such a feat not far from him!

The Emperor Realm was the pinnacle of the Martial Dao, the ultimate pursuit of a martial artist’s life. This realm symbolized overwhelming strength and supreme status.

So even though he didn’t know who was about to break through, seeing that phenomenon still left Yang Kai a little excited.

One day, he too would climb to the peak of the Martial Dao. One day, he would also ascend to the Emperor Realm!

Maybe he could sneak over and observe. Witnessing the birth of an Emperor Realm cultivator with his own eyes was an opportunity no one could afford to miss. Watching the process could help him accumulate precious experience for his own future.

Of course, most people didn’t want to be disturbed when breaking through to the Emperor Realm. But Yang Kai was only there to observe, not to cause trouble, so he felt no guilt.

With that thought, he hesitated no longer. In a flash, he sped toward the source of the commotion.

Before long, he arrived atop a shattered star.

He had just steadied himself and hadn’t even had time to approach when three figures suddenly leapt out from all sides.

These three had hidden themselves extremely well. Yang Kai’s attention had been entirely on the phenomenon, so he hadn’t noticed them until they charged out, startling him awake.

The moment they appeared, the three unleashed a flurry of deadly attacks without mercy. Sword light flashed, and a frigid profound intent swept out, instantly turning the ground around them into frozen earth.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but shiver, a cold gleam flashing in his eyes. He raised his hand and struck in all directions, and in an instant, countless palm shadows filled the sky.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

After a fierce clash, Yang Kai stood unmoving, while the three who had ambushed him all cried out in shock and were sent flying back.

“Form the array!” One of them, clearly shocked by Yang Kai’s strength, shouted sharply.

The other two, obviously fellow disciples who had coordinated countless times, immediately flew to her side. No one knew what secret technique they used, but their auras instantly merged into one.

“Hm?” Only now did Yang Kai have a chance to get a good look at the three. What he saw made him raise his brows and quickly raise his hand. “Wait!”

But the three, now arrayed, stared at Yang Kai with icy faces. They had no intention of letting him speak. As their swords swept out, an even fiercer cold descended than before.

“Are you from Ice Heart Valley?” Yang Kai shouted again.

He had infiltrated Ice Heart Valley before, so he was familiar with their disciples’ attire. The three women before him were clearly dressed as Ice Heart Valley disciples.

He hadn’t expected that the ones who’d ambushed him without a word, intent on killing him, would turn out to be from Ice Heart Valley.

There must be some misunderstanding here. Yang Kai’s mind raced. These three were likely guarding the one breaking through to the Emperor Realm, and his arrival had made them mistake him for an enemy, so they attacked without hesitation.

Yang Kai’s question didn’t make them pause. Judging by their posture, they were about to unleash a terrifying killing move. The surging energy fluctuations even made Yang Kai feel a twinge of awe.

He had no choice but to announce himself: “My name is Yang Kai. I wonder if you three young ladies have heard of me.”

Sure enough, his words had an effect. The three women froze, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment. The icy chill enveloping the world gradually faded.

The leading woman blurted out, “You’re Yang Kai—Senior Brother Yang?”

“That’s right!” Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief, knowing they had indeed heard of him. After all, back in Binglun City, he had done quite a bit for Ice Heart Valley.

“He does look a bit like him. Both his features and build match the image Senior Sister showed us.”

“He’s just too dirty. You can’t even see his face clearly…”

“And his clothes are all tattered.”

The three women huddled together, whispering as they sized Yang Kai up, clearly trying to confirm his identity.

Though their voices were soft, Yang Kai heard every word clearly. He couldn’t help but smack his forehead in embarrassment.

He’d spent a year and a half in that void rift, constantly trying to subdue the Mountain and River Bell. The repeated injuries had left him looking more like a ghost than a man. After finally succeeding, he’d been so overjoyed he’d forgotten how disheveled he looked.

If not for these Ice Heart Valley disciples, he might not have realized it at all.

With that thought, Yang Kai circulated his Origin Qi, shaking off all the blood and grime from his body. Then, with a wave of his hand, a ball of water formed from the Undying Five Elements Sword’s water sword aura appeared in his palm.

He scrubbed his face vigorously, then looked up and flashed the three a brilliant smile, baring his white teeth. “Take a closer look, ladies.”

“Ah, it really is Senior Brother Yang!”

“No doubt about it, it’s Senior Brother Yang!”

Once they were sure it was Yang Kai, the three women cheered and immediately dropped their hostility, walking over with embarrassed smiles.

The leading disciple cupped her fists awkwardly. “Please don’t blame us, Senior Brother Yang. We sisters thought you were an enemy chasing us, so we attacked without thinking. Please be magnanimous and don’t hold it against us.”

“It’s fine!” Yang Kai waved it off. “Is someone chasing you?”

The woman nodded. “Yes! We’ve been chased for many days.”

“Who?”

Her face darkened and she gritted her teeth. “Who else but the Wenqing Sect’s Young Sect Master!”

“Feng Xi!” Yang Kai’s brows rose in surprise. “Feng Xi is strong, but you three aren’t weak either. Why would you fear him?”

The woman replied, “If it were the old Feng Xi, we wouldn’t have much to fear. But these past days, our Senior Sister’s aura has been fluctuating—she was already on the verge of breaking through. We didn’t dare risk a direct clash with Feng Xi, in case it disrupted her and cost her the chance to ascend!”

“Senior Sister…” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He glanced at the spot where the phenomenon was gathering, delighted. “So the one breaking through to the Emperor Realm now is Zi Yu?”

“Yes. When we arrived here, Senior Sister could no longer suppress it and had to break through. The three of us are standing guard. When you showed up, Senior Brother Yang, we thought you were from Wenqing Sect, so…” She blushed, clearly embarrassed about attacking Yang Kai without asking questions.

Yang Kai smiled. “Zi Yu truly is a peerless talent. I’m impressed!”
He hadn’t expected that the one breaking through to the Emperor Realm here would be Zi Yu from the Ice Heart Valley. Although he’d only interacted with her a few times before and wasn’t particularly close, he knew she was the most outstanding disciple of the entire sect.

Now, she was living up to everyone’s expectations, seizing her chance to break through after two and a half years in the Shattered Star Sea.

The Ice Heart Valley disciple said, “Senior Sister always said Senior Brother Yang is the most formidable. She rarely praises anyone, not even Wenqing Sect’s Feng Xi, but she thinks very highly of you. That’s why, after we met in the Shattered Star Sea, she showed us your image and told us to treat you with respect if we ever ran into you.”

“Yes, we all heard about what Senior Brother Yang did in Binglun City. You’re amazing.”

Yang Kai chuckled. “Zi Yu is no less than anyone. She was just being polite. Look, she’s breaking through to the Emperor Realm, while I’m still stuck at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.”

Hearing this, the three Ice Heart Valley disciples remembered that Yang Kai was still at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, while their own Senior Sister was already breaking through to the Emperor Realm.

Whether Zi Yu succeeded or not, at least she’d taken this step before Yang Kai. In their eyes, she was certainly not inferior to him—maybe even better.

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious. “Breaking through to the Emperor Realm is fraught with danger. Throughout history, countless prodigies have perished at this hurdle. Zi Yu is breaking through in haste—how confident is she?”

One of the Ice Heart Valley disciples replied, “Senior Sister said she’s sixty percent confident.”

The other two also looked worried.

“Sixty percent…” Yang Kai frowned. That wasn’t a high chance. If Zi Yu failed, dying under the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy wouldn’t be surprising.

“And the people from Wenqing Sect have been chasing us. Who knows if they’ll find us here.”

Yang Kai said, “Don’t worry. Since I’m here, I’ll wait with you. If the Wenqing Sect dares show up, none of them will leave alive!” As he spoke, his face was full of murderous intent.

He still had an old score to settle with Feng Xi. That Emperor Extinction Pill of Feng Xi’s had caused him a lot of trouble. If he hadn’t retreated in time and been strong enough, Feng Xi would have killed him long ago.
