## Chapter 684 — The Movement of Wind

Xu Qi also said, "Yes, it was indeed his own wish to enter the Wind Eye. I tried my best to dissuade him, but what can I do if he refuses to listen?"

Cang Yan twitched the corner of his mouth, forcing a smile as he said coldly, "It’s best that way. Otherwise, you Leiguang should be prepared for your clan's extermination."

Xia Chengyin's expression turned cold. "Brother Cang Yan, this is the territory of our Divine Cult. Please do not be too reckless."

"Enough of the bickering." Du Wan shouted, suddenly realizing that Yang Kai had entered the Wind Eye. He felt uncomfortable; had he known there would be such danger, he would never have allowed Yang Kai to come to Leiguang as an Honored Guest.

"Right now, young friend Yang's safety is of the utmost importance. Cang Yan, what did you perceive just now?" Du Wan looked at Cang Yan, inquiring.

"He is still alive, but his aura is somewhat chaotic; it doesn’t seem like he’s refining pills." Cang Yan replied faintly.

Du Wan's expression darkened, glancing at Xia Chengyin. "Sect Leader Xia, it seems entrusting him to your sect was not a wise choice. If he is fortunate enough to come out safely, I will bring him back to the Alchemists' Association. I hope you understand."

Xia Chengyin nodded with a grim expression. Since Du Wan had said so, even if he wanted to keep that alchemist, he would likely be unable to. He glared at Duan Hai and Xu Qi, gritting his teeth. "You two did a fine job. Not a single person could be kept under control. I see you don’t care to hold onto your elder positions any longer."

"It was his own..." Xu Qi mumbled.

Duan Hai shook his head with a sigh, feeling their luck had truly run out.

Had Elder Du and Cang Yan arrived a few days earlier, this situation would not have arisen. It just so happened that after he and Xu Qi had engaged in battle, these two came to the Leiguang Divine Cult. Was it a matter of his bad luck or Yang Kai's misfortune?

The group fell into a silent wait, no one speaking, the atmosphere growing somewhat tense.

Xu Qi and Duan Hai exchanged glances, both sensing the seriousness of the situation.

That brat was undoubtedly unable to leave the Wind Eye alive. The question before them was what would Du Wan and Cang Yan's attitudes be if he died.

They truly did not know why Cang Yan had gotten involved; it seemed unrelated to Tianxiao Sect.

Inside the Wind Eye, when Yang Kai had just been thrown in, waves of intense pain surged through him. The omnipresent wind blades sliced at his body, and in an instant, he was drenched in blood, his clothes in tatters.

True Yuan was imprisoned, and Yang Kai could not defend against the wind blades' attacks, relying solely on the fortitude of his body to endure.

He did not hasten to use the Demon God Transformation but immersed his consciousness in his back's shoulder blade. There, the Wind-and-Thunder Wings, obtained through Han Fei, the commander of Mo Shen Fort, seemed to have suddenly been triggered, undergoing unexpected changes.

The intensely rich wind energy around surged towards his back, being absorbed cleanly by the Wind-and-Thunder Wings.

A sharp pain coursed through him, and Yang Kai's expression turned pained and struggling.

It was a sensation akin to being torn apart; the raging wind energy swept through his body, causing every inch of his flesh to squirm.

Suffering, Yang Kai gritted his teeth and remained silent, allowing the Wind-and-Thunder Wings to devour the surrounding wind energy.

He faintly felt that this was an opportunity, an opportunity to refine the Wind-and-Thunder Wings!

Han Fei and Li Rong had told him before that this pair of Wind-and-Thunder Wings had come from an unknown source, having passed through many hands before landing in Han Fei's possession. They, too, had made multiple attempts to refine them but had never succeeded.

When he was brought to the edge of the Wind Eye by Duan Hai and Xu Qi, Yang Kai sensed that the Wind-and-Thunder Wings craved the energy here; hence, he had offered no resistance and allowed Duan Hai to throw him in.

Now it seemed that he was not mistaken.

The long-sealed Wind-and-Thunder Wings seemed to receive immense nourishment, bursting with vitality, and their devouring speed was rapidly increasing, even his formidable body was unable to withstand it.

His body continued to be destroyed, and the rushing wind attribute energy wreaked havoc within him.

Not daring to hesitate, Yang Kai quickly took out Wan Yao Ling Milk from the Black Book Space and swallowed it.

A warm sensation spread from his abdomen, quickly reaching every part of his body.

The powerful recovery of Wan Yao Ling Milk and the destructive force of the Wind Eye turned Yang Kai's body into a battleground, forming a difficult tug-of-war.

Flesh was continuously damaged, then squirmed and grew back, recovering to become more resilient and stronger.

Yang Kai endured, gradually growing numb and feeling no pain at all.

The speed at which the Wind-and-Thunder Wings devoured wind attribute energy became increasingly terrifying. An invisible vortex seemed to emerge from his left shoulder, pulling the surrounding intense energy into his body, filling the Wind-and-Thunder Wings, and the more wind attribute energy it obtained, the more vibrant the Wind-and-Thunder Wings appeared.

From the outside, a small vortex appeared in the gigantic Wind Eye, resembling a black hole, devouring the Wind Eye itself.

The onlookers outside who were concerned for Yang Kai's life displayed expressions of astonishment, unsure how such a turn of events had occurred.

The Wind Eye was a forbidden area of the Leiguang Divine Cult and was the foundation upon which the sect was established. Since its appearance, an unknown number of years had passed. Over the years, countless disciples who practiced wind attribute martial skills and techniques had gained unimaginable benefits here, yet no matter how many people absorbed wind energy, the Wind Eye had never changed, nor had it weakened.

But now, everyone clearly felt that the wind energy filling the heavens and earth seemed to have been drawn away by someone, rapidly decreasing.

This discovery caused several members of Leiguang to change color dramatically.

If the power of the Wind Eye weakened, it would be a massive loss for Leiguang.

"Duan Hai, did that Honored Guest Yang mention what pill he intended to refine?" Xia Chengyin still clung to the words of his two elders, believing that the changes in the Wind Eye were definitely caused by Yang Kai's pill refining.

"He didn’t say." Duan Hai replied with a stiff neck.

"Elder Du, what do you think?" Xia Chengyin turned to look at Du Wan.

Du Wan's face darkened. "Nothing about the pill requires such immense energy; it doesn’t look like pill refining at all but rather seems to be cultivation practice!"

"Cultivation?" Xia Chengyin was momentarily stunned. "Practicing cultivation inside the Wind Eye? Isn't he only at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm?"

"Don't ask me, I have no idea." Du Wan snorted, evidently unhappy with Yang Kai being in such a dire situation.

Xia Chengyin's expression turned awkward, daring not to say more.

The destructive power contained within the Wind Eye made everyone here reluctant to release their Divine Sense to probe, so they could only wait quietly.

Not knowing how much time had passed, the small vortex that had appeared in the Wind Eye gradually expanded, seemingly drawing the Wind Eye into its grasp, and the wind attribute energy around it was evidently much less than before.

"Sect Leader, if this continues, the Wind Eye will be destroyed!" Duan Hai shouted, coming up with a plan.

Xia Chengyin's face turned ashen as he stared at the Wind Eye in silence. He knew well what the consequences would be if this continued. If the Wind Eye were to be destroyed, it would be equivalent to destroying the foundation of Leiguang.

"I implore you, Sect Leader, to allow me and Junior Brother Xu Qi to intervene and stop this disaster." Duan Hai volunteered.

"How do you intend to stop it?" Xia Chengyin looked at him strangely.

"Currently, the only way is to take action and eliminate Honored Guest Yang inside the Wind Eye. He must be using pill refining as a pretext to disrupt the foundation of our Leiguang." Duan Hai spoke with malice.

"Young friend Yang is not that kind of person!" Du Wan coldly snorted.

"Do you dare to try?" Cang Yan also shot him a dark look, a glint of killing intent in his eyes.

"This is an internal matter of our Divine Cult; Brother Cang Yan, you are being overly nosy." Duan Hai said somewhat discontentedly.

"I also do not allow you to act so recklessly. If young friend Yang encounters any misfortune due to your actions, I can guarantee that no alchemist will ever refine pills for your Leiguang again!" Du Wan glared deeply at Duan Hai.

Duan Hai felt a headache coming on.

He could disregard Cang Yan's attitude, but Du Wan's words carried significant weight. Given his status, he could indeed do that. With a mere command, those alchemist Honored Guests would surely abandon the Leiguang Divine Cult, treating it like a fierce tiger to be avoided.

"Elder Du, calm down. Duan Hai was just speaking casually." Xia Chengyin quickly expressed, knowing that angering a Saint-Grade alchemist could have severe consequences.

At that moment, the enormous Wind Eye exhibited significant changes, as the vortex emerging from its depths suddenly expanded.

A tremendous pulling force surged forth, causing everyone to nearly lose their footing as they all activated their True Yuan to resist it, gazing intently at the changes in the Wind Eye.

Inside the Wind Eye, Yang Kai suddenly felt that the restraints placed on him by Duan Hai had shattered, and the True Yuan sealed within his meridians surged rapidly.

Not only that, but the flesh around his shoulder blade was squirming at an astonishing speed, as if something was about to burst forth from his body.

He had experienced this sensation once before when he acquired the Wings of Yang Flame.

His heart settled, and he showed no signs of panic, relaxing his mind and allowing the flesh on his back to squirm.

Whoosh...

A pair of wide, magnificently beautiful wings suddenly unfurled from Yang Kai's back. As they opened, all pressure vanished in an instant, a profound sense of comfort washing over him.

The wind attribute energy enveloping him seemed no longer harmful but rather warm and welcoming.

The lively wind energy swirled around him, and Yang Kai could sense the movements within it, merging himself into the wind.

Glancing to the side, Yang Kai's eyes flashed.

He discovered that his Wings of Yang Flame had undergone a significant change.

The right half of the wing burned as brightly as ever, like fire.

However, the left half not only contained the power of True Yang Yuan Qi but also the dynamic force of wind, and its color had become even more beautiful and dazzling.

The wind attribute energy within the Wind Eye continued to pour unceasingly into the left half of his wings. Yang Kai could clearly feel himself growing stronger rapidly. As he waved his wings, torrents of wind spiraled forth, forming blades of wind that surged towards the Wind Eye.

Those winds and blades not only contained the liveliness of wind but also the searing heat of True Yang Yuan Qi; the combination of the two enhanced each other’s lethality exponentially.
