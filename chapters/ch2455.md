## Chapter 2455 — Want to Duel Me?

"Since that's the case, I'll spare your dog life!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, then turned to Lan He and said, "Miss Lan, go take his Spatial Ring."

"Me?" Lan He was taken aback. Although she felt this wasn't quite right, she also knew Yang Kai was currently inconvenienced, so she could only nod, fly over to the martial artist, and extend her hand to him.

The martial artist, face full of pain, reluctantly removed his Spatial Ring and handed it to Lan He.

Yang Kai, face stern, shouted, "Who else wants to buy their life? If you do, hurry up. If you're late, you won't get another chance."

"This... isn't this just taking advantage of us while we're down?"

"Kid, don't go too far."

"There are dozens of us, it's not like we're really afraid of you. I advise you to quit while you're ahead."

"That's right, that's right. Brother Yang, let things go when possible. Leave some room for future encounters!"

"Let things go when possible?" Yang Kai sneered, looking ahead with contempt. "I didn't see any of you showing mercy to me just now, and now you spout this crap—what use is it! I'll say it one last time: if you want to buy your life, cooperate now, or don't blame this Young Master for being ruthless and killing you all here!"

As he spoke, he once again raised the Myriad Sword high, looking as if he was about to strike.

The faces of the dozens of Dao Origin Realm cultivators all turned extremely ugly.

Yang Kai had only struck the Mountain and River Bell twice just now, yet most of the cultivators were already injured. Trapped in this natural formation, they couldn't even escape if they wanted to. If he struck a few more times, they really might all die here.

"Don't give in! The more you yield, the more he'll push his luck. Never compromise with him. Everyone, join forces and fight him—it's not like we have no chance to survive!" Yin Lesheng suddenly shouted. Of everyone present, he was the least willing to see Yang Kai act so domineering, so when he saw someone about to give in, his eyes turned red with urgency.

"Brother Yin, you truly have a backbone." Yang Kai looked at him with a cold sneer, full of ridicule. "Then this Young Master will wait and see just how long you can keep up that tough act."

Yin Lesheng's face was so dark it seemed he could scrape off a layer of frost.

Changing his tone, Yang Kai said in a deep voice, "I'll count to three. If you still don't cooperate after three, then all of you can go meet your end! One..."

"Two!"

Before Yang Kai could even say 'three', someone shouted, "Brother Yang, I'm willing to hand over my Spatial Ring. Please spare my life!"

"Very good." Yang Kai's gaze shifted to the speaker. "Hand over your ring and stand aside."

Lan He silently walked up to the person and extended her hand.

After handing over his Spatial Ring, the man immediately darted to the side.

"I'm willing to hand over my Spatial Ring too!"

"Me too!"

"Just hand it over. There's nothing good in there anyway. Better than dying here."

In an instant, buying their lives with Spatial Rings became the prevailing trend. Among the dozens of cultivators, more than half quickly chose to hand over their Spatial Rings.

Lan He was overwhelmed with complex emotions. She had thought she was doomed this time—after all, she was up against dozens of Dao Origin Realm enemies. How could she possibly survive?

Yet the situation had taken a dramatic turn. She and Yang Kai, who should have been at an absolute disadvantage, had now seized the initiative, leading dozens of cultivators by the nose.

It all felt too abrupt. And it was all thanks to Yang Kai alone.

Facing dozens of Dao Origin Realm cultivators without fear—this was courage. Using the Mountain and River Bell's power to trap and intimidate the enemy, leaving them unable to advance or retreat—this was strategy. Such a person, both brave and cunning, was a first for Lan He.

In no time at all, she had collected more than twenty Spatial Rings.

Even as the Senior Sister of Heavenly Wolf Valley, who had seen many grand occasions, she couldn't help but tremble with excitement. Each of those more than twenty Spatial Rings was heavy and substantial.

These were the Spatial Rings of elite disciples from major sects. Each one was overflowing with wealth. The combined fortune of more than twenty Spatial Rings was unimaginable to her.

After a while, even those cultivators who had been hesitating dared not delay any longer. Yang Kai's Imperial Treasure was still poised before the Mountain and River Bell—who knew when he might strike again?

One by one, they could only swallow their pride, remove their Spatial Rings, and hand them to Lan He, secretly vowing that one day Yang Kai would pay for offending them.

The dozens of Dao Origin Realm cultivators who had originally gathered together were now split into two groups: those who had handed over their Spatial Rings, and those who stubbornly refused.

There weren't many stubborn ones left—only five or six. Yang Kai looked over and saw they were all from Netherworld Sect and Brahma Heaven Sacred Land.

He sneered at Chang Hao, "Looks like Holy Son Chang Hao wants to die here."

Chang Hao frowned and said, "Brother Yang, how about we make a deal? Let me and Chang Xian go, and we'll remember this favor. You'll be well rewarded in the future!"

"The future!" Yang Kai sneered, face cold. "We'll talk about the future when it comes. Today, I only want your Spatial Rings."

Chang Hao said, "Brother Yang, is this really necessary? By doing this, you're offending at least twenty sects. Will you still have a place in the Star Realm in the future?"

Hearing this, Yang Kai nodded deeply. "Brother Chang Hao makes a good point. I hadn't thought of that."

Chang Hao was delighted, but before he could say more, Yang Kai continued, "So what you're saying is... I should kill everyone after taking their things? Tsk tsk, Brother Chang Hao, what a vicious mind you have. Truly, people can't be judged by their appearance, and the sea can't be measured by a bucket!"

As soon as he spoke, the cultivators who had handed over their Spatial Rings all glared angrily at Chang Hao.

Chang Hao wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and hurriedly said, "Brother Yang, you've misunderstood. I would never encourage you to do something so untrustworthy. That would ruin your great reputation. I just meant that having more friends is better than more enemies. What do you think?"

"You want to be friends with me?" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Chang Hao cupped his fists. "If Brother Yang doesn't mind, hehe..."

"I do mind, and you're not qualified." Yang Kai's face turned cold as he stared at him.

Chang Hao's smile froze, his face flushed red with embarrassment.

As the Holy Son of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land, even in the entire Star Realm he was a leading figure among the younger generation. Who wasn't qualified to be his friend? Yet Yang Kai, just a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, dared to speak so shamelessly! And to reject him so bluntly in front of everyone—how could he save face?

He was practically fuming.

Chang Xian, standing nearby, also looked embarrassed. As a fellow Holy Son, seeing Yang Kai slap Chang Hao in the face like this made his own face burn, as if he'd been slapped hard as well.

"Brother Yang, must you be so stubborn?" Chang Hao said coldly.

Yang Kai snorted, "If you keep yapping, I'll take your dog life first!"

"Fine, we'll remember what happened today. I hope the next time we meet, you'll still be this arrogant!" Chang Hao spat out, then, together with Chang Xian, took off their Spatial Rings and tossed them to Lan He before turning to join the crowd.

Yang Kai curled his lip. "What's the use of spouting threats? If you've got guts, come fight me now and let me teach you how to behave!"

Chang Hao's body stiffened, almost provoked into turning back to fight. Fortunately, at the last moment, he remembered how Yang Kai had just instantly killed a cultivator of the same level. With such terrifying strength, he knew he wasn't a match—even if he joined forces with Chang Xian, at best they could only avoid defeat.

"Another stubborn fool who needs to be thoroughly humiliated before he's willing to cooperate," Yang Kai sneered.

Chang Xian suddenly turned to Lan He and said, "Miss Lan, I don't know what your relationship with Brother Yang is, but you should be careful. Earlier, Chang Hao and I saw him alone in a room with Yu Ying from Netherworld Sect. Yu Ying even came out of the Secret Treasure with her clothes in disarray. You know what kind of woman Yu Ying is better than I do. We're all disciples of Eastern Territory sects—I just hope you don't fall into demonic hands."

Hearing this, Yang Kai's face darkened. "Still trying to sow discord! There was nothing improper between me and Yu Ying, so stop slandering my reputation."

Chang Xian chuckled, "Yu Ying said the same thing earlier."

With that, he walked off into the crowd without looking back.

Lan He frowned slightly and glanced at Yang Kai, her expression odd.

Yang Kai said, "Miss Lan, you don't believe that, do you?"

Lan He replied, "As long as Brother Yang has a clear conscience, it has nothing to do with me!"

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then nodded. "That's true!"

After saying this, he turned to look at Yin Lesheng, a smile that didn’t reach his eyes on his face. “Brother Yin, now it’s just you and your companions left. So tell me—are you going to cooperate, or… cooperate, or perhaps… cooperate?”

The three remaining were all disciples of the Netherworld Sect. Yin Lesheng held a high position there, being the Sect Master's personal disciple. Even though he hadn't been in the sect long, he was already in charge of many affairs.

Since he didn't speak, the other two didn't dare decide either.

Yin Lesheng smiled proudly. "I hate being threatened most. Anyone who has ever threatened me has never met a good end."

Yang Kai's eyes lit up. "What a coincidence — I'm the same way."

Yin Lesheng said, "Proud people often have much in common. Yang Kai, if you really want my Spatial Ring, fight me for it. If you can beat me, I'll hand it over with both hands."

"You want to duel me?" Yang Kai squinted at him.

"Afraid, Brother Yang?" Yin Lesheng sneered.

Yang Kai snorted, "Since Brother Yin is so interested, this Young Master will give you a chance!"

Hearing this, Yin Lesheng was overjoyed. Although Yang Kai's strength was extraordinary, Yin Lesheng was fully confident he could remain undefeated. That's why he could speak so calmly to Yang Kai, and even being trapped in this natural formation didn't faze him.

If he wanted to leave, he could do so at any time—it would just come at a high price. Unless absolutely necessary, he wasn't willing to pay it.
