## Chapter 754 — Nine Heavens Divine Technique

The Cheng elder was slain with a single strike, and Hai Wangu, who had narrowly escaped, fled like a dog without a home, frantically trying to put distance between himself and Yang Kai.

Yang Kai cast him a cool glance but did not move; the immense sword that had felled the Cheng elder flowed like a rope, slithering after Hai Wangu like a boneworm and binding him no matter how he tried to dodge.

Yang Kai beckoned, and the sentient rope that bound Hai Wangu dragged him back.

“Is that the Nether Heaven Lock?” Yang Kai asked the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saintess.

“Yes!”

“Interesting—why do I suddenly understand these Soul Techniques?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously. “And my Divine Sense seems much stronger. What did you do to me?”

“Can we talk about that later?” the Saintess’s eyes flickered; she seemed reluctant to answer.

Yang Kai merely nodded and didn’t press.

The two Soul Techniques just used were ones Yang Kai had never encountered, yet he wielded them smoothly, grasping their subtleties as if he had cultivated them for years.

He could not have learned them for no reason—the only explanation was the Saintess’s earlier action.

It seemed she had directly infused those Soul Techniques into him, allowing him to instantly perceive their profundities.

Moreover, Yang Kai’s manifested Divine Sense was not especially powerful—ordinarily it would at best match Hai Wangu’s—but with the Saintess’s assistance his not-so-strong power could sever the Cheng elder in one blow.

Yang Kai felt a surge of bewilderment and irritation.

“What do you plan to do with him?” the Saintess asked, pointing at the bound Hai Wangu.

“What else?” Yang Kai sneered. The binding rope suddenly burst into flames, and amid Hai Wangu’s desperate screams his Spirit Body was burned to ashes, leaving not even a trace.

In the Court of Divine Battle only Yang Kai and the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saintess remained.

They regarded one another; under Yang Kai’s piercing gaze the Saintess seemed uneasy, averting her eyes.

“What is your name?” Yang Kai asked.

“An Ling’er… and you?”

“Zhang the Third!”

An Ling’er’s face immediately clouded. Yang Kai’s flippant answer irritated her, but constrained by her status she could not scold him and seethed inwardly.

“Now tell me exactly what you did just now,” Yang Kai said in a low voice. “That technique of yours seemed strange.”

“You really want to know?” An Ling’er pursed her lips. Yang Kai nodded solemnly. “If I don’t know, how can I be sure it won’t harm me?”

“Rest assured—it will do you no harm. And I have no motive to hurt you.”

“I still want to be clear about it.”

“Very well.” An Ling’er drew a deep breath. “Since you insist, I will tell you.”

She fell silent as if organizing her words, then continued after a pause: “You should know something of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—we find each generation’s Saint Lord by sending out a Saintess to search. We employ special means to find a suitable candidate; if they pass the trials they become the next Saint Lord. As for the exact methods, I cannot say much, but I can tell you it’s related to the cultivation method I practice.”

Yang Kai inclined his head faintly.

“You’ve likely heard—before being found, Saint Lords come from all walks of life with varied aptitudes, but once they enter the Sacred Land and ascend to the role, they are reborn and achieve extraordinary feats; this owes much to us Saintesses.”

“Oh? How so?”

“We are born to be the Saint Lord’s crucible. What we cultivate and master is prepared for the Saint Lord. Find him, bring him back, and pour into him all we have learned—this is the purpose of a Saintess. Because there is more than one Saintess in the Sacred Land, the Saint Lord gains immense benefit; it’s why every Saint Lord attains such formidable power. He is not training alone—depending on the number of Saintesses, three or five, perhaps seven or eight will assist him. These people are his crucibles; what they cultivate is all given to him, and his gains become unparalleled. Trained this way, a Saint Lord’s rise is inevitable.”

“So wondrous?” Yang Kai exclaimed.

“This is the Sacred Land’s secret—don’t let it slip.” An Ling’er warned sternly.

“Don’t worry, I’m not a blabbermouth,” Yang Kai said, nodding, then mused: “So the reason I mastered your Sacred Land’s Soul Techniques is because you poured into me what you learned?”

“Yes—what you now command are the things I’m proficient in. Though a Saintess does not kill in life, she can use this special method to assist a Saint Lord; and the benefits we confer go beyond that. As you felt, with my aid your Divine Sense power grows.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned odd. “I’m not a Saint Lord—how could you use that on me?”

An Ling’er sighed softly and bit her lip. “Though I hate to admit it, you likely possess the potential to become a Saint Lord.”

“You must be joking.”

“It’s true. I only meant to boost your soul strength to face those two, not to imbue you with Sacred Land techniques, but you somehow comprehended them. Tell me—how many techniques did you grasp?”

“Only those two.”

“Two is already remarkable. Even with a Saintess’s enlightenment, a Saint Lord often needs multiple trials to master a Sacred Land technique; for you to comprehend two in an instant speaks volumes.” An Ling’er marvelled.

Yang Kai’s eyes darted. “How many techniques do you have?”

“Nine,” An Ling’er smiled faintly. “Want to learn?”

“Whatever.” Yang Kai was noncommittal, feigning disinterest.

“I could give you all I know, but there’s a condition.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened—he disliked bargaining.

“Come back to the Sacred Land with me. Not only will I personally enlighten you, my three other sisters will help as well; you will grow in the shortest time.”

“You want me to return and be the Saint Lord?” Yang Kai grinned.

“Yes. I think I’ve found the right person—even if you’re a bit annoying,” An Ling’er admitted.

“Not interested.” Yang Kai laughed and shook his head.

“You…” An Ling’er’s eyes rounded in shock—she had not expected such a decisive refusal.

The position of Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was coveted; the islands held by the Seven Families Alliance were bustling, and outsiders flocked like fish in a stream, all hoping a Saintess would notice them—being chosen meant instant ascension.

Wherever An Ling’er went people thronged, old and young alike.

Now she had offered and been refused; she felt unreal, staring at Yang Kai as if in a dream.

“If I want power I’ll cultivate it myself—why leech off women?” Yang Kai sneered. “That’s living off others.”

“Don’t you know what being a Saint Lord grants?” An Ling’er’s brows knitted. “Becoming a Saint Lord makes you a hegemon of the world; you gain things most never will—wealth, fame, status, beauties, whatever you desire.”

“Including you?” Yang Kai cast her a lecherous look.

An Ling’er flushed but nodded. “Yes. I and my three sisters are crucibles for the Saint Lord—whatever you do with us, we would not resist; you could enjoy all pleasures.”

“Tempting.” Yang Kai licked his lips with a lecherous grin, feigning interest.

“So…”

“I won’t go!” Yang Kai sneered and recoiled, shaking his head. “Every gain has a cost; the price for becoming Saint Lord must be high.”

An Ling’er’s face shifted; she fixed him with a long gaze and nodded. “There is a rumor in the Sacred Land—no proof, but it may be the Saint Lord’s price.”

“Speak it.”

“Each Saint Lord does not live long… the longest-lived barely three hundred years.”

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land was a major power; with many Saintesses aiding a ruler’s cultivation, progress was rapid—he might reach the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm in no time.

Reaching the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm elevates one beyond mortality and greatly extends lifespan; living only three hundred years suggests premature death.

Even some Third Stage Transcendent Realm experts in other powers live for several centuries.

Hearing such a cost, Yang Kai lost interest in being a Saint Lord—three hundred years might seem long, but for a martial cultivator it was a blink.

Yang Kai believed that if he declined the post, he’d still live well beyond three hundred years—perhaps traveling the world with Su Yan and his junior sister, carefree, rather than sacrificing his future for fleeting gains.

“But consider this—pay the price and you gain a lifetime of glory few ever attain,” An Ling’er persisted.

Yang Kai chuckled, “In thirty years I’ll stand equal with your Saint Lord.”

“Thirty years…” An Ling’er stared at him in astonishment. “You speak with unusual confidence.”
