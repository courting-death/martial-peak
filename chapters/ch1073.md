## Chapter 1073 — Heavenly Might

Inside the Alchemy Room, only the subtle sound of medicinal liquid rolling within the pill furnace could be heard.

Zong Ao concealed his figure in the darkness, terrified of disturbing Yang Kai; he even suppressed his breathing and temporarily stilled his heartbeat, like a corpse.

He stared with absolute focus at the pill furnace, at the busy silhouette ceaselessly working before it.

The Pill was only halfway refined. Under the action of the Divine Sense Fire and the various spirit formations, the medicinal liquid was mutually fusing, undergoing a fundamental transformation.

For no apparent reason, Zong Ao suddenly had a strange feeling.

That Yang Kai’s Pill this time would at the very least give birth to Pill Patterns.

This sensation was one he had never experienced before. Zong Ao had not been observing Yang Kai’s alchemy for merely a day or two; he had watched for a full half year. Although the chance for Pill Patterns to appear in the Pills Yang Kai refined was frighteningly high, there were times of failure as well, when in the end only an ordinary Leaving Flame Pill was harvested.

Never had such a situation occurred—while he was still refining, Zong Ao could be one hundred percent certain the Pill would definitely develop Pill Patterns!

What kind of reasoning was this? Zong Ao was secretly shocked, growing ever more cautious as he gazed over, refusing to miss a single detail.

Yet no matter how he looked, Yang Kai’s movements were the same as before—no additions, no omissions. Even the spirit formations he depicted were those he had seen thousands of times. With his eyes closed he could still know what Yang Kai’s next step would be, what spirit formation he would carve.

The only difference was that aura—that momentum brimming with absolute confidence.

It was precisely this aura that influenced his judgment, letting him confirm the Pill could give birth to Pill Patterns even before it left the furnace.

Would a Pill Cloud ultimately be generated? Success or failure came only once. Zong Ao was impatient to know the final answer.

He couldn’t help feeling some admiration for Yang Kai, because if he himself were in that realm he would certainly be agitated, certainly feel pressure like a mountain. Once such a sign appeared he would be unable to devote himself wholly to alchemy, and failure would be inevitable.

Yang Kai did not—he remained indifferent as though to a common thing, his expression neither happy nor sad, as if refining a Pill of no consequence. His movements were steady, meticulous; everything that could be done he pushed to its limits.

Time flowed by. Zong Ao burned with anxious impatience.

A faint pill fragrance gradually wafted through the Alchemy Room; this was the sign the Pill was about to leave the furnace.

Yang Kai’s expression seemed to grow a touch more solemn—every time a Pill was about to be taken out, he treated it with a thousandfold greater caution.

The Divine Sense Fire waxed and waned in strength; strand after strand of Divine Sense Threads inscribed spirit formations within the furnace. Every subtlety was executed to the utmost.

In his eyes and heart there was a clarity like a bright mirror, without stray thoughts—and by this point he even forgot the pill furnace before him and the Pill that was about to take shape.

A Pill bearing a Pill Cloud suddenly resurfaced in his mind!

That had been the first and only Pill he obtained which possessed a Pill Cloud, found together with Sacred Land Saintess An Ling’er within the ruins beneath the sea. Though he later swallowed it and its vast medicinal efficacy transformed the Warm Spirit Lotus from five-colored into six-colored, before ingesting it he had continually observed that Pill Cloud, seeking to draw some inspiration.

At this moment, all sorts of memories churned up, and he vaguely grasped a sliver of a key point.

The obscure places of the past abruptly became clear in this instant. His eyes involuntarily widened, blooming with a different kind of brilliance.

The final compound spirit formation was depicted and branded into the pill furnace. Yang Kai’s Divine Sense Fire erupted completely, refining that compound spirit formation into the Pill that had yet to fully form.

His body suddenly felt as though a great gash had opened; Saint Yuan and Divine Sense power simultaneously poured out like a mountain collapsing, like a river breaching its dikes. The previously full Sea of Consciousness dried in an instant—the water level of that inner sea sank straight to the lowest point, and an enormous amount of Saint Yuan also drained away in that moment.

Darkness swam before Yang Kai’s eyes; he nearly fainted.

He felt as though even his life was being sucked empty, as if he would die in the very next breath.

Thick pill fragrance diffused from within the furnace—far richer than the one thousand eight hundred Leaving Flame Pills Yang Kai had refined before.

A crisp sound rang out from inside the pill furnace, so pleasant to the ear.

Yang Kai grinned, frozen in place.

Zong Ao’s heart nearly leapt from his chest. How could he not see the abnormality that struck Yang Kai at the instant the Pill was about to form? Such an anomaly made him so excited he was nearly driven mad.

He thought Yang Kai had already succeeded.

Yet after waiting half a moment, Yang Kai showed no movement.

Calling out softly several times and receiving no response, Zong Ao then cautiously stepped forward, quietly releasing his Divine Sense to probe; upon seeing, he could not help but be stunned.

Yang Kai’s face was frighteningly pale, as if he had just waged a fierce battle against some powerful enemy. His aura rose and fell unsteadily, and the power of his Qi and blood was weakened to the extreme…

He had already closed his eyes, fallen unconscious—but he would not die; so long as he recuperated for some days he would recover.

Ignoring Yang Kai, Zong Ao’s trembling hand slapped atop the furnace. A Pill flew out on cue and was caught by the jade bottle in his palm.

Taking a deep breath, Zong Ao concentrated and looked into the jade bottle.

After one glance, Zong Ao could not help revealing a disappointed expression.

The surface of that Leaving Flame Pill within the jade bottle was round and smooth—where was there any trace of a Pill Cloud? It hadn’t even produced Pill Patterns.

Failed? Zong Ao’s expression was complex. That aura Yang Kai exhibited while refining just now had nearly convinced him the boy would certainly succeed, yet he hadn’t expected such a bleak conclusion.

When Yang Kai awakens and discovers the final Leaving Flame Pill he poured his heart and soul into refining is merely an ordinary Pill, who knows whether he might faint once more.

Zong Ao let out a heavy sigh.

He had lived who knew how many years, and knew well the enormous gap between dreams and reality. He himself had struggled and hesitated countless times between the two, yet been pierced everywhere by the ubiquitous thorns within that chasm.

Yang Kai was still a young man; having such an experience was not surprising. It was just that the Pill Cloud had not been refined, and he refused to seek aid on Shuiyue Star—by the look of things he truly was at death’s door.

Zong Ao couldn’t help some sighing emotion. Through their time of interaction, he had come to clearly recognize Yang Kai’s talent in alchemy. He truly could not bear to see Yang Kai die early like this; in his mind he was already considering how, once Yang Kai awakened, he ought to comfort him a few times in the tone of an elder.

At this time, what he needed most was consolation and encouragement.

While he was considering, Zong Ao’s expression suddenly changed again.

He sensed the surrounding Spiritual Qi becoming somewhat bizarre.

Releasing his Divine Sense, Zong Ao cried out in shocked alarm.

The vast Spiritual Qi between heaven and earth, for some reason, was frantically converging here—far more terrifying and shocking than the disturbance Yang Kai had caused while cultivating before. In the sky, the dense Spiritual Qi almost coalesced into a tangible form, like a great dragon soaring, dancing across the nine heavens.

A massive attractive force suddenly transmitted from the jade bottle in his hand. The freshly produced Leaving Flame Pill seemed to have life, jumping within the jade bottle and emitting ding-ding-dang-dang sounds.

That giant dragon soaring in the sky dove straight down like a god unleashing might, bombarding the palace Zong Ao had lived in for a hundred years.

A tremendous boom sounded. Half the palace collapsed in an instant; dozens of side halls became broken walls and shattered ruins. All kinds of timber smashed toward Zong Ao but were rebounded by his protective Saint Yuan.

Heaven and earth Spiritual Qi visible to the naked eye poured into the jade bottle. The jade bottle was fundamentally unable to withstand such pressure and directly burst apart.

Like a bottomless abyss—however much Spiritual Qi came it swallowed, without any limit. The surrounding Spiritual Qi collapsed into that point, forming a roaring vortex where the jade bottle had been; strands of essence, pill fragrance and even fragments of the Leaving Flame Pill’s power were all torn inward and vanished. In an instant a rift in the air yawned open, sucking up heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi from a thousand li around until the region fell deathly quiet, as if the world itself had been leeched dry.

Violent winds howled at his ears, vision blurred—sand and stones flew as a thousand mu of medicinal fields were ravaged beyond recognition. Zong Ao saw many of his own rare herbs dancing in the gale, shredded to powder.

The skin on his face twitched; his heart was bleeding.

Those herbs had been personally cultivated by him—each plant infused with his sweat and blood. Now a Spiritual Qi storm swept past; all thousand mu of medicinal fields were affected. Many herbs were uprooted entirely, and those remaining were tossed about chaotically in the wind.

“Bastard!” Zong Ao’s old face twisted; he could not help howling, clawing and gesticulating in the storm, yet powerless to stop this disaster.

Half an hour later, everything returned to calm.

Amid broken walls and ruined eaves, Yang Kai still sat cross-legged. The dozens of pill furnaces before him had not shifted at all, maintaining their original positions, but Zong Ao’s palace had collapsed nearly completely, and even the unconscious Xue Yue was buried deep underground.

Zong Ao could not be bothered with that little girl; he held a new jade bottle in hand, within which was a Pill, and gazed absentmindedly at his thousand mu of medicinal fields—his facial flesh twitching uncontrollably in waves.

All thousand mu of medicinal fields had been affected—those remaining intact were practically nonexistent.

Of the herbs that had been growing robustly before, ninety percent were lost; the remaining ten percent had dim life force, liable to die at any moment.

The leaves and fruits on over a dozen Tianyang Fruit trees had vanished without a trace, leaving only bare trunks—those Tianyang Fruits would have come into great use after another ten years.

The half mu of Quehe Lotus had long disappeared; even that half mu of land had been ploughed several times by Heavenly Might, the ground half a foot lower than before.

Where is this old man’s Qiandie Flower? Zong Ao turned his eyes feebly—how could he still see any sign of the Qiandie Flower he cherished like life? On the earth where it had originally grown there remained only half a broken root stub.

Zong Ao’s eyes rolled over and he nearly fainted.

Without mentioning the loss of these thousand mu of medicinal fields, Zong Ao was horrified to discover the great array he had laboriously laid within this valley through so many years had been completely destroyed, no longer able to exert its proper effect.

Within a thousand li radius, heaven and earth were dim—there was not the slightest trace of Spiritual Qi remaining!

From afar came the rapid sounds of robes fluttering closer. Halika, Lin Mufeng and that middle-aged woman led many experts of the Hengluo Commerce Guild as they rushed over upon hearing the news.

When Heavenly Might first manifested here they had already sensed something, but did not know what had happened—so they hurried over to investigate.

Upon arriving and taking one glance, everyone was dumbstruck, for a moment hardly able to believe their own eyes.
