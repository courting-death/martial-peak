## Chapter 1972 — Who Exactly Are You?

"Do numbers help?" Xu Qing sneered coldly, looking at Yang Kai with contempt. "How much strength can the two of you truly display right now?"

After all, from his point of view Yang Kai had previously stood before Mo Xiaoqi to block the Fire Bird's attack and had surely taken heavy losses; being seared by that black flame and yet still alive was nothing but luck.

And after Mo Xiaoqi used that Secret Treasure, she had looked utterly spent.

Clearly, neither of them were at their peak, and the power they could muster had been greatly reduced.

He himself, however, was in perfect condition, so he felt at ease and unafraid.

Yang Kai chuckled softly and said coolly, "If Brother Xu truly thinks that, then by all means give it a try."

Seeing Yang Kai so nonchalant, Xu Qing frowned; he could not tell whether Yang Kai was merely bluffing or truly had nothing to fear.

Not far off, Mo Xiaoqi still stood there despondent, staring at Xu Ruomei—whose eyes had already lost their luster and whose spirit was utterly gone, reduced to a fool—and she murmured, "Why did you ambush me? How could this happen?"

Yang Kai glanced at her and couldn't help but scold, "Idiot—people die for wealth as birds die for food. You don't even understand such a simple truth; do your parents know you went out to court death like this?"

"They don't know," Mo Xiaoqi's eyes flashed with a touch of panic as she waved her hand at Yang Kai, "Please, don't you dare tell my father I'm here, or he'll beat me!"

"I don't even know your father, how would I tell him?" Yang Kai muttered, almost exasperated to death by the girl.

"Oh, that's true," Mo Xiaoqi immediately looked relieved.

"Enough!" Xu Qing barked, seeing the two of them chatting as if no one else were present; his rage flared and he let out a low, feral snarl, "Brother Yang, if you don't want to die, you'd better leave now—you have no reason to stand against me."

Yang Kai gave a light laugh and looked at Xu Qing with a calm air, "We indeed have no reason to be enemies, but… what Brother Xu seeks is precisely what I have my eyes on as well."

Xu Qing paused, staring at Yang Kai in surprise. "Brother Yang, you hide your strength well," he exclaimed, "but if that's the case, why not join forces? We split the spoils two to one — together we might turn three into five."

"No, no." Yang Kai shook his head and raised a finger, "I have a flaw—I like to hog things and am not inclined to share. Brother Xu, if you have any sense, it's still not too late to leave now."

"Aren't you afraid of overeating and getting stuck?"

"My appetite is excellent!"

Mo Xiaoqi looked on bewildered and interrupted, "What are you two planning to eat? I have some spirit fruits here, do you want some?"

As she spoke she actually produced two plump, dewy spirit fruits from her Spatial Ring. For a moment their fragrance spread, making mouths water, and from the energy fluctuations emanating from the fruits they were clearly no ordinary things—very likely extremely rare treasures.

"If you don't speak, no one will think you're mute," Yang Kai glared at her angrily.

Mo Xiaoqi looked thoroughly wronged.

"Hmph, if Brother Yang puts it that way, then there's no bargaining," Xu Qing swallowed and his expression grew increasingly feverish. The fine items casually taken from Mo Xiaoqi inflamed his greed; he became ever more convinced that her ring hid countless treasures.

At the thought that once he seized that ring all his lifetime cultivation resources might be secured, Xu Qing could no longer contain himself.

"Ever since Brother Xu's sneak attack on me, there is nothing more to discuss," Yang Kai sneered.

"Very well! Then let Xu see just how much Brother Yang is truly capable of!" Xu Qing's words had barely fallen when a roaring tide of power surged up from within him, and in the span of a single breath his whole frame swelled, growing several sizes larger.

The fabric of his clothes hissed and in an instant shredded into strips, scattering to the ground, while golden hair sprouted from his exposed skin, visible to the naked eye.

In no more than three breaths, Xu Qing's whole appearance had transformed dramatically.

At this moment he stood over five zhang tall, his frame slightly hunched, arms unnaturally long and muscles bulging into corded ridges; a feral light flashed from his eyes and a low, beastlike growl rumbled from his throat. His body was covered in golden fur, making him resemble a colossal golden ape.

Yang Kai was stunned.

He had never seen such a secret art before—at least not in his native Star Domain; the wonders of the Star Realm were truly extraordinary.

Yet Yang Kai could not help but feel contemptuous: even in the dangerous situation just now, Xu Qing had not used his trump card, and when dealing with him he had not hesitated to unleash it.

"Beast-soul symbiosis? Golden-furred giant ape?" Mo Xiaoqi cried in astonishment, her pretty eyes trembling slightly, and then she did something that baffled Yang Kai.

She actually put both hands over her eyes, refusing to look at Xu Qing's nearly naked torso—though the shredded cloth still covered his nether parts.

What a silly girl! Yang Kai was utterly speechless and had completely given up on the idea of teaming up with her.

The one who had revealed his trump card, Xu Qing, roared and turned into a streak of golden light, charging at Yang Kai with unfathomable speed.

His fist, larger than a cooking pot, came down from above with the force to cleave mountains and split seas, enveloping the area.

What speed!

Yang Kai instantly realized just how troublesome Xu Qing had become. He drew in a long breath, set his foot, and made no move to dodge — instead he funneled every ounce of his strength into a single, straight punch that shot forth like a coiled beast unleashed.

A look of scorn and mockery flashed across Xu Qing's eyes as he sneered, "A mantis trying to stop a chariot—overestimating yourself!"

The enormous fist fell even faster.

Boom……

With a deafening crash Yang Kai groaned; half his body was driven into the earth, and Xu Qing, more than five zhang tall, staggered back as if nearly blasted away.

Staring in amazement from his golden-haired face, Xu Qing had not expected Yang Kai's physical strength to be so great, but he quickly steadied himself and raised the other fist high, striking down again like a meteor falling from the void, whipping up a piercing roar.

Yang Kai's body was half trapped in the ground and he found it hard to move; facing this blow he could not evade.

Forced, he could only raise his arms to block.

Another tremendous crash sent Yang Kai fully into the earth, leaving only half his head above the surface.

Xu Qing didn't spare a glance for Yang Kai's condition nor care whether he lived or died; instead he shifted his stance and charged toward Mo Xiaoqi.

In his view, contending over life and death with Yang Kai was meaningless—if he could snatch Mo Xiaoqi's Spatial Ring, his objective would be achieved.

Mo Xiaoqi still stood there covering her eyes, utterly unaware of the impending danger; her cheeks were flushed and even her earlobes glowed red. For someone as innocent as a blank sheet of paper, even the sight of Xu Qing's beast-formed upper body was more than she could bear.

Her heart trembled with panic.

Oh no, oh no—she wouldn't suddenly go blind, would she?

Aunt Feng's warning still rang in her ears: "Never look at a man's ugly body—it's said it will gouge out your eyes!"

Mo Xiaoqi still remembered Aunt Feng's serious expression and earnest tone when she said it, so she was thoroughly upset.

Xu Qing moved with terrifying speed and in an instant reached Mo Xiaoqi's side. Looking at the defenseless girl and the dazzling Spatial Ring on her hand, he couldn't help but grin.

He reached out and grabbed for Mo Xiaoqi's Spatial Ring.

Because of Yu Ruomei's fate, he dared not harm Mo Xiaoqi—who knew what powers that armor she wore still possessed? If he followed in Yu Ruomei's footsteps the consequences would be severe.

From beginning to end his target had only been Mo Xiaoqi's ring.

But with his great hand still a foot from the ring, the two earrings at Mo Xiaoqi's ears suddenly chimed. The unassuming ornaments shimmered and turned into two shafts of divine light, streaking toward Xu Qing like arrows.

The cutting edge of them made Xu Qing's pores constrict and the golden hair over his body bristle.

His face changed and he dared not attack Mo Xiaoqi; he retreated hastily.

The two rays of light were relentless, closing in from left and right to strike Xu Qing in a pincer.

In that crisis Xu Qing let out an angry roar and a golden radiance flickered over him; his already enormous form seemed to swell another size.

Two hissing sounds rang out as Xu Qing's golden light abruptly shattered; his body jolted and he grunted, stumbling back several steps.

The two beams of light returned and resumed their earring form, settling once more on Mo Xiaoqi's delicate earlobes.

But a huge gash had opened in Xu Qing's abdomen and blood spurted out like a fountain. In a panic he hastily circulated his power to staunch the flow.

He stared at Mo Xiaoqi in disbelief, unable to believe that the girl had not even raised a hand—that the Secret Treasure's self-defense alone had inflicted such a grievous wound on him.

Yu Ruomei had not died unjustly!

"Who exactly are you?" Xu Qing bellowed.

By now, if he still couldn't tell that Mo Xiaoqi was no ordinary person, then he was not fit to be a Void King Realm cultivator. He regretted, inwardly cursing himself for having taken notice of Mo Xiaoqi.

Such a person was surely the descendant of some great figure.

If he dealt with her cleanly it might have been manageable, but if there were any slip-ups and information leaked, he would face endless pursuit.

If that information fell into the hands of her elders, his life would be worse than death.

But the arrow had already been loosed; regret was useless. He must finish what he started and silence her permanently.

While he was lost in thought, a murderous intent suddenly bloomed behind him. Xu Qing was shocked and turned his head to find Yang Kai rushing down upon him with hair standing and eyes wild, his body flashing with dazzling five-colored light and a furious, feral power brewing in his hands like an enraged beast.
