## Chapter 1132 — The Man Who Tests the Array's Power

Three days later, Yang Kai was in the middle of pill-refining when he suddenly heard Yang Yan shout excitedly, "Combine!"

In the next instant the earth trembled and mountains shook; pebbles and fragments in the stone chamber rattled down. Before long everything settled, and a thunderous cheer rose from outside.

What on earth was going on? Yang Kai frowned, tidied his furnace, herbs, and the Pills he had refined, then stepped out in curiosity.

No sooner had he left the cave than he saw dozens of people standing outside beaming with joy, as if something wonderful had occurred. Even the usually sullen Wu Yi wore a broad smile, while Yang Yan looked positively arrogant, her face radiating a supreme, invincible pride. Yu Feng stood nearby buttering her up so shamelessly that Yang Kai felt embarrassed for them both, yet neither showed the slightest shame or self-awareness.

"What's the situation?" Yang Kai asked, stepping up beside Wu Yi.

"Oh, Yang Yan finished arranging the defensive array," Wu Yi replied with a smile.

"Is it ready?" Yang Kai glanced around. Nothing about the surroundings looked particularly different—indeed, it appeared unchanged—but faintly he sensed something off about this patch of land, though he couldn't say exactly what it was.

His expression turned grave at once; he realized he had somewhat underestimated Yang Yan's prowess with arrays. This defensive formation she had set up revealed nothing to his eye.

"Yang Yan, how powerful is your defensive array?" Yang Kai called out, beckoning her over.

A sly glint flashed through Yang Yan's eyes as she egged him on, "Do you want to go in and try? Go ahead—I’ll show you how it works."

Yang Kai studied her for a long moment before shaking his head. "If I go in, won't that be embarrassing?"

"Hard to say. Aren't you supposed to be strong? You can cut down someone at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Maybe you can easily break my formation," Yang Yan teased, acting mysteriously.

Yang Kai smiled and focused his attention even more closely.

Arrays cannot be judged by ordinary standards. He might be able to slay martial artists at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, but once trapped in a profound formation, even the mightiest could find no way out.

Though Yang Yan spoke vaguely, her confidence was plain for all to see. Yang Kai could be certain: if he actually entered, he'd almost certainly make a fool of himself.

With so many eyes watching, he wasn't about to risk that embarrassment.

Seeing Yang Kai still examining the area, Yang Yan tossed her head indifferently. She had great faith in the array she'd laid; without mastery, even someone overwhelmingly powerful would find it impossible to escape.

Unfortunately time and materials were tight; the array she had set up only provided defense and could not slay an enemy. Given enough time and materials, she could have turned the entire Dragon Lair Mountain into a forbidden zone—anyone entering within a thousand zhang of Dragon Lair Mountain without her permission would be as good as a lamb led to the slaughter.

Yang Kai clearly didn’t understand formations—if he could make sense of what he was seeing, that would be the strange part. She wasn’t worried in the least.

Yang Kai truly couldn’t discern anything unusual. When he sent his Divine Sense into it, it was as though a stone had sunk into the sea—without stirring the slightest ripple. This greatly astonished him, for the space before him seemed capable of devouring Divine Sense itself!

He had to remember his Divine Sense was no ordinary cultivation of a Saint King Realm. Although his Realm had only just reached the Saint King Realm, his Divine Sense cultivation was certainly not below the Origin Returning Realm; if even his Divine Sense could not probe it, the array's refinement was astounding.

His face grew more serious. Yang Kai steeled himself, squeezed a drop of blood from his fingertip, and smeared it over his left eye.

Since he had absorbed the Great Demon God's World-Ending Demon Eye, he had used it only once before—in the Tongxuan Continent when facing that Bone Race expert. He never expected he would have to use it again now just to peer into Yang Yan's array.

Golden Blood mingled with his eye; in an instant Yang Kai's left eye turned a solemn gold, a color that seemed to devour a person's soul. Yang Yan and Wu Yi standing beside him instinctively shrank back; for some reason they felt a chill.

Using the World-Ending Demon Eye, Yang Kai finally detected some traces of the array.

The World-Ending Demon Eye was innate to the Great Demon God—marvelously profound and capable of piercing all falsehoods. Yang Yan's array was indeed artfully concealed, but it still left traces.

Scanning the area around the cave, Yang Kai saw nearly a thousand zhang of subtle energies flowing in secret. These energies were invisible to the naked eye and imperceptible to ordinary Divine Sense, but they could not evade the World-Ending Demon Eye's detection.

From those drifting, hidden energies, Yang Kai sensed a dangerous aura!

That he could detect some clues did not mean he could break the formation. Startled inwardly, his estimation of Yang Yan shot up; the youngster he'd brought back was not just precious—she was a rare treasure.

"Yang Kai, are you going in or not? Hurry up—I want to know how powerful my array is," Yang Yan urged when she saw him still motionless.

Yang Kai withdrew the World-Ending Demon Eye and smiled, shaking his head. "I won't go in and make a scene, but the people to test the array's power have already arrived."

Saying that, he suddenly lifted his head and looked off into the distance.

"Who's coming?" Yang Yan asked in puzzlement.

"People from the Xu Family!" Wu Yi's pretty face darkened as she too noticed a group rapidly approaching from afar. Once she recognized the leader she couldn't help but exclaim, "Xu Family's Family Head, Xu Zhikun, the Five Great Elders, and the four Guest Elders are all here!"

"Not a small force," Yang Kai sneered coldly.

Their feud with the Xu Family was really absurd. He had only gone to Tianyun City to do a bit of business; Yang Yan had merely been molested by some worthless Young Master of the Xu Family, yet it had escalated into such a large affair.

But now that they were at odds, he had no fear.

"Don't underestimate them, Yang Kai. Although Xu Zhishen is formidable within the Xu Family, he is not the strongest. Rumor has it the Family Head Xu Zhikun is nearly at the Origin Returning Realm and is far more powerful than Xu Zhishen. The other elders and Guest Elders are veterans at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. With so many of them together..." Wu Yi warned anxiously.

While she knew Yang Kai was strong, even a tiger can be overwhelmed by sheer numbers. The Xu Family had brought their elite this time; they clearly wouldn't let the matter rest.

"I don't underestimate them, but the Haike Family's people have come too—interesting!" Yang Kai's gaze turned cold as he looked to the other side.

Over there another group was quickly flying this way, a lineup no less impressive than the Xu Family's—Saint King-Grade warriors, many at the Third Stage among them.

Following his gaze, Wu Yi's face went white as she murmured, "The Family Head is here too..."

The two families had clearly coordinated to come together. Yang Kai wouldn't let the Xu Family have things easy, but he didn't know what stance the Haike Family would take in all this.

The last time Yang Kai had driven off Ba Qingyan, the Haike Family had lost face—it's possible they might side with the Xu Family this time.

If that were the case, Yang Kai would show no mercy whether or not they were from Wu Yi's clan. He was grateful to Wu Yi, but harbored no kindness toward the Haike Family.

The two families' members soon gathered together and stood arguing, not leaving.

After a short while a dispute seemed to flare; the Xu Family's Family Head Xu Zhikun strode forward in fury, flicked his sleeve, and led his Xu Family strong to approach the cave, while the Haike Family remained standing at a distance and did not move.

Seeing this, Wu Yi couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

She truly didn't know what she'd do if the Family Head and elders all came over. After all, she had once been of the Haike Family; although some elders and Guest Elders under the Family Head looked ill-disposed, at least they hadn't come any closer.

That was the outcome Wu Yi most hoped to see.

Even Yu Feng and those dozens of warriors seemed to relax and looked much more at ease.

"Qingyan, you know Yang Kai's strength best—what do you think his fate will be this time?" Ian, Family Head of the Haike Family, asked, turning to the pale-faced Ba Qingyan.

A few days earlier Ba Qingyan had been injured by Yang Kai and returned to the Haike Family. The elders and Guest Elders were all shocked; they had tried to overestimate Yang Kai, yet still underestimated his capability.

According to Ba Qingyan's account, Yang Kai's Divine Sense cultivation was already comparable to an Origin Returning Realm expert. They didn't know how he had trained, but this only proved the youth was no simpleton.

Though they had wanted to win him over, Yang Kai’s attitude still left them furious. This time, when the Xu Family sought to join forces with them to cause Yang Kai trouble, Ian hadn’t given any clear response. Even after arriving here, he hadn’t gone forward—he merely stood by, watching the situation unfold. His stance of staying on the sidelines all but revealed his intent to sit back and watch the tigers fight.

Hearing Ian's question, Ba Qingyan's face darkened. "Although he's strong, I don't think he can defeat the Xu Family. For the Hundred Mountains Painting, the Xu Family has brought nearly all their top masters. Even if he kills one or two, two fists cannot beat four hands—he will surely die."

"That's fine!" Ian's eyes flashed with a keen light; he was very satisfied.

"Family Head, why don't we go up? Since Yang Kai is sure to die and his attitude toward our clan is awful, we needn't recruit him. If we go up now we can curry favor with the Xu Family, and perhaps even snatch the Hundred Mountains Painting when Yang Kai dies!" Elder Warren murmured.

"Exactly, Family Head. If the Xu Family loses the Hundred Mountains Painting and we grab it, even if we can't keep it we could demand huge compensation. For the Hundred Mountains Painting the Xu Family will certainly pay handsomely," Guest Elder Huang Juan added eagerly.

"You don't mean the Family Head plans to wait until they fight to mutual ruin, then sweep in to take the spoils?" Someone, sharper-witted, suggested.
