## Chapter 874 — Agreement Reached

“Back so soon? It’s been less than three years.” Caidie frowned. “The Spiritual Qi here is far richer than in the Beast Sea Great Forest. There are Spirit-Grade Pills and Crystal Stones; we’ve made great progress these past few years, Great Lord. I don’t want to give this place up.”

The Great Lord smiled at her. “And what do you propose? I only agreed to look after the Nine Heavens Sacred Land on his behalf, not to seize it. Now that he’s returned, things should naturally be returned to their proper owner. Besides, he has done our yao tribe some favors; without him the Huasheng Pool’s problem wouldn’t have been solved.”

“Isn’t there any other way?”

“You could play the rogue!” The Great Lord chuckled as if joking, then waved a hand. “Go and greet him.”

Caidie bowed her head in acknowledgement, then vanished in a flash.

At the outer slopes of one of the Nine Peaks, Yang Kai and Li Rong had only just arrived when a burly figure dropped from the sky, smashing the ground so hard it shuddered. Without waiting for introductions he barked, “Who dares set foot in yao territory? Be sensible and get out now, or don’t blame me for being rude.”

As he spoke he swaggered, all imposing might, eyes like a tiger’s glaring at Yang Kai and Li Rong. But in the next moment the yao expert’s expression shifted from anger to stunned delight.

“Yao territory?” Yang Kai smiled. “Kuang, that’s not right. This is the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—when did it become your yao tribe’s territory?”

“Yang Kai?” Kuang Shi shouted as he barreled forward. Li Rong tensed; without a cue from Yang Kai she merely watched the bearded wild man warily and didn’t strike.

Up close, Kuang Shi roared with laughter. “Ha! I thought some blind idiot had come by—so it’s you. Why didn’t you give us a heads-up before arriving?”

“Isn’t this me saying hello now? It’s been years—Kuang, you seem to have improved a lot.”

“All thanks to the Crystal Stones you folks dug up. And those pills the alchemists made—without them I wouldn’t have advanced so much… But compared to you, it still feels trivial. How are you on the same level as me?” Kuang Shi beamed with uncontained joy.

The last time Kuang Shi had seen Yang Kai, Yang Kai had been slightly inferior; now, to their surprise, both of them were at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

Kuang Shi had thought his own progress fast enough, but compared to Yang Kai he couldn’t help feeling envious.

“Tell me, brother, you came back so soon—are you planning to reclaim this place?” Kuang Shi asked with a sour look.

“Yes. You’ve used it for two or three years already; that’s long enough. You’ve surely mined plenty of Crystal Stones by now.”

“Only two or three years…” Kuang Shi sounded unsatisfied. “Whatever, this isn’t my concern. You’re going to see the Great Lord, right? He should be in the palace on the central peak. I won’t come with you—Caidie ordered me to stay and guard the gate, hehe.”

“No need for company; someone’s already come to meet me.” Yang Kai grinned, gazing at the approaching aura of seven-colored mist.

Moments later, Caidie flashed into view, wings shimmering as she appeared before Yang Kai.

She cast him a faint look, then turned her attention to Li Rong.

Both Li Rong and Caidie were experts at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; Caidie felt a pressure from Li Rong that was hard to place, and it made her want to test who was superior.

“Miss Caidie!” Yang Kai smiled and bowed slightly.

Caidie finally withdrew her gaze and glanced at Yang Kai. “What brings you here?”

Yang Kai blinked at the question and said lightly, “To see the Great Lord, of course, and have him honor his earlier promise.”

Caidie’s brows drew together. “If it’s about the Nine Peaks… how about letting my tribe use them for a few more years?”

“That wouldn’t be right.” Yang Kai felt helpless and shook his head. “My people are still waiting to move in.”

“Just a few years… after that we’ll definitely leave!”

Yang Kai frowned, displeased. “Is that the Great Lord’s decision or yours?”

“The Great Lord is not a man of empty promises—this is my suggestion. If you agree, I can give you some benefits.”

“And if I don’t agree?”

“I will make you agree!” Caidie said stubbornly, staring at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sighed and, losing patience, said, “I’m not going to argue. Li Rong, stop her.”

“Yes!” Li Rong answered and, with a graceful motion, appeared directly in front of Caidie.

Caidie ignored her. With a graceful sweep of her hand, seven-colored light washed over Yang Kai; the light carried strange powers and instantly wrapped him as if to bind him.

But in the next instant, Caidie’s beautiful eyes widened in astonishment, for she had lost track of Yang Kai. Within the seven-colored light a peculiar energy fluctuation occurred—Yang Kai vanished like a phantom and reappeared on a peak more than ten li away.

Caidie stood dazed, unable to figure out how Yang Kai—an opponent at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm—had broken free. Li Rong’s attack had already arrived, and Caidie had to rouse herself to defend.

Yang Kai appeared leisurely before the main hall and strode straight forward.

Entering the hall, he found the Great Yao Lord smiling at him.

“Great Lord, long time no see.” Yang Kai greeted as he approached.

The Great Lord shook his head. “Not that long, I feel like I saw you just yesterday.”

“That’s irresponsible of you to say—three years have flown by. I’ve come to reclaim what belongs to me.” Yang Kai retorted.

“Don’t worry—I won’t cling to this place.” The Great Lord smiled wryly. “Caidie acted on her own against you; I’ll reprimand her. But who did you bring with you? There’s something odd about her aura.”

“Odd how?”

“Like you, her cultivation looks clear at a glance, but in actual combat she seems to fight beyond her level.” The Great Lord’s tone grew serious.

“Heh, you’re overthinking it.” Yang Kai shook his head and declined to pursue the subject.

“Very well. Give me half a month; I’ll have my people withdraw.” The Great Lord’s expression turned stern. “I hope after this we can remain on good terms.”

“Of course. I hope to obtain many rare medicinal materials from you, just like when the old Saint Lord was alive—each side taking what it needs.”

“That would be best!” The Great Lord nodded in satisfaction.

Yang Kai was pleased too; he had expected trouble but found the Great Lord reasonable—a man who keeps his word.

Dealing with someone like that made Yang Kai feel at ease.

After talking a while longer, the Great Lord suddenly said, “One thing puzzles me—can you explain it to me?”

“What is it?”

“Why do I sense yao qi from you? It’s faint, but there’s a trace of it… and it doesn’t seem ordinary. It feels like a very noble bloodline—somewhat similar to my own aura.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed; he knew the Great Lord was sensing the Dragon Emperor’s aura.

The Great Lord’s true form is a Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon, so a connection to true dragons made sense.

No wonder the beast’s—no, the yao’s—sense of smell was so keen.

“You didn’t have that aura the last time I met you. What happened to you these past few years?” the Great Lord asked sternly.

“Nothing much—just wandering around.”

The Great Lord laughed softly, recognizing Yang Kai’s reluctance to speak. He didn’t press the matter.

After arranging the time, Yang Kai left. In half a month he would return to take over the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Outside the Nine Peaks, Li Rong and Caidie were still locked in fierce combat in the sky.

It wasn’t a life-or-death fight, but two experts of the same cultivation still battled with earth-shattering force.

The waves of their fight drew many yao experts to watch below; Kuang Shi watched with rapt attention.

“Who’s stronger?” Yang Kai leaned forward and asked, looking up.

“The woman you brought is stronger! She doesn’t seem to be showing her full strength; Caidie is already on the back foot.” Kuang Shi commented with relish. “Women fighting is a sight—Caidie’s clothes are torn, makes it all the more entertaining.”

“Careful—say that within Caidie’s earshot and she’ll pull your tongue out!” Yang Kai warned.

“I don’t think so.” Kuang Shi jumped and stammered, “I spoke softly—she couldn’t have heard me.”

“Walls have ears…” Yang Kai said with a laugh, glancing aside.

Following his gaze, Kuang Shi turned and saw a catgirl with her ears perked up, eavesdropping on their conversation.

When she realized she’d been spotted she giggled and held out a hand to Kuang Shi. “If you want me not to tell Caidie, just give me all your Crystal Stones.”

“Lady, I only have ten Crystal Stones left.” Kuang Shi looked miserable and pleaded, “You’re the eldest—just pretend you didn’t hear. Kuang Shi will remember this favor forever.”

“I don’t care—give me whatever you have.”

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, ignoring them, then called up to the sky, “Li Rong, let’s go.”

Hearing him, Li Rong disengaged and descended gracefully, glancing at Caidie, then joined Yang Kai and followed him.

Hanging in midair, Caidie panted heavily, chest heaving, still shaken.

She hadn’t expected that someone else at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm could be so much stronger—she’d been completely suppressed and never seized the initiative.

In contrast, the other woman had fought with a calm, effortless demeanor.

That woman… was terrifyingly formidable. Caidie felt both admiration and resentment.

Yet she didn’t pursue them. After watching Yang Kai and the woman leave, she hesitated, then launched herself toward the main hall.

From the look on Yang Kai’s face it seemed the matter with the Great Lord had been resolved. Although Caidie didn’t want to give up the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, she wouldn’t dare embarrass the Great Lord; if he ordered it, she would obey.
