## Chapter 717 — Perilous Death and Rebirth

The starry sky was vast and boundless; to lose one's way here meant certain death.

Having felt his gains were sufficient, Yang Kai set off on the return journey. Though the starry sky around him was utterly empty, he used the planet beneath his feet—whose distance he could not gauge—as a reference point and felt he would not get lost.

Day after day he advanced. His speed was tremendous, yet the road ahead remained long. Yang Kai was not impatient; his body and mind were relaxed as he strove to extract every possible benefit from this starry ether.

At a certain moment he abruptly halted, frowning as he probed with his senses.

The flowing starry forces at his side seemed to be stirring in an unusual way—something that had never happened before.

Yang Kai went instantly alert, whipping his head around, his face blanching.

Within the endless firmament, well within sight, a vast energy vortex had risen like a tempest, covering the boundless starscape. It spun and advanced toward his position.

Its speed was terrifyingly fast!

Yang Kai froze. Though he had spent these days seeking denser pockets of starry force to temper his body, he had never imagined that such savage, storm-like energies could even exist in the starry sky.

From that distant origin a scent of death wafted toward him.

He felt he could not withstand it. In an instant Yang Kai thought this: with his current bodily strength, should he be swallowed by such a storm, his corpse would be gone in short order.

The starry sky had always been perilous terrain.

Zhai Yao and Elder Li had no knowledge of what marvels the starry sky concealed, nor had they ever seen a starry sky storm, so they could offer Yang Kai no information.

Realizing this, the hairs on Yang Kai's body stood up. Without a second thought he quickly removed the Hunyuan Shackles that had always bound his ankles and fled at top speed.

Since Fei Yu had gifted him the Hunyuan Shackles, Yang Kai had worn them constantly; now, to save his life, he had to take them off.

Like a bolt of lightning he streaked through the stars, reaching far in the blink of an eye.

Yet he still felt it was not enough. The Wind-and-Thunder Wings on his back flared open with a whoosh, their powers propelling his speed to the limit.

Wind lends agility, thunder lends swiftness. Once fully refined, the Wind-and-Thunder Wings were fused with the Wings of Yang Flame, greatly enhancing both his combat power and his velocity.

He did not know how long he kept fleeing and had no leisure even to glance back, but from the sensation behind him he understood that he had not shaken the starry storm; rather, it drew nearer and nearer.

Its area of coverage was simply too vast; without the utmost speed he could never escape its shroud.

After rushing for several hurried days, Yang Kai's True Yuan was heavily depleted. The starry storm had approached until it loomed before his eyes; in that boundless void he felt as if the heavens themselves were about to collapse upon him.

His expression went icy. He halted mid-sprint, the Wind-and-Thunder Wings folded back into his body, and he turned to stare at the storm sweeping toward him.

Escape was impossible—there was no hope of fleeing.

If he could not flee, he would have to meet it head-on.

Yang Kai did not know if he could come through unscathed, but now he could only throw caution to the winds and fight with everything he had.

As the storm approached, he surprised himself by feeling not fear but exhilaration. A desire to test himself against the tempest stirred within him; his blood boiled, his eyes shone, and martial ardor flared from his soul.

The starry forces around him were chaotic and violent, yet could not be compared to the storm itself.

Not far ahead lay a small meteorite sea, hundreds to thousands of fragments drifting—some only as large as a basket, others as vast as mountain ranges.

It was through that meteorite field that he had just passed.

In an instant the destructive storm swept over the meteorite sea; every stone it touched turned to dust, large and small alike.

Hundreds or thousands of meteorites spanning a vast area were gone within the space of three breaths, leaving only particles of dust in the starry void.

Yang Kai grinned, a silent and uncanny smile curling his lips.

In the next moment the storm swallowed him.

"Enter Demonic State!" a low murmur issued. Lines of pitch-black demonic qi condensed into explosive energy streaks; Demon Marks spread across Yang Kai's body, searing into his flesh.

Qi and blood surged wildly, his corporeal strength rising by leaps and bounds.

Yang Kai brandished his Bone Shield and held it before him.

But that Mystery-Grade, Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure lasted less than two breaths before shattering in his hand, proving utterly ineffective.

Ruinous energies enveloped Yang Kai; his garments were torn to shreds, flesh flayed, blood flying. Gritting his teeth, he let out a low cry as True Yuan erupted, coating his frame.

Yet that pure True Yuan, when it appeared, was like early spring snow—blown away and dissipated.

Yang Kai's face darkened as he realized that True Yuan could provide him no protection here.

To withstand this annihilation he would have to rely on his physical body alone.

With that realization he ceased wasting True Yuan and concentrated wholly on his body's transformations, steering himself against the storm's tide and forging ahead.

He was like a lone skiff in a maelstrom, tossed amid towering waves and forever on the verge of being overturned.

Strangely, though he lurched and staggered, he remained vibrantly alive.

Starry forces everywhere poured through his torn flesh into his frame, bringing strange, rampant energies that rampaged within him.

His internal organs were grievously damaged; his visage was corpse-like, blood spattered like rain. No place on his body remained intact; it was as if a layer had been peeled from him—tendons, veins, and flesh lay exposed, a horrific and fearsome sight.

Even after invoking the Demon God Transformation, in this storm—even with Yang Kai's tenacious body—he could not wholly withstand it. His body was maimed, his soul rattled; the spirit energy in his Sea of Consciousness seemed as if it might be blown free.

Wasting no time, Yang Kai took out the Wan Yao Ling Milk. No longer caring for the rarity of this Saint-Grade medicine, he gulped it down and smeared it over his wounds.

The potent medicine, combined with the surging Qi and blood from the Demon God Transformation, rapidly mended his damaged areas—but each repair was immediately sundered again, cycling without cease.

As time passed, the surrounding aura of destruction grew denser and more violent, and Yang Kai found himself gradually being drawn into the very center of the storm.

Flesh tore away from bone, revealing bones that gleamed with golden light.

That was the Indomitable Golden Body—the skeletal body forged by the Great Demon God!

Under the storm's onslaught the bone body remained untouched, not a single scratch upon it.

Yang Kai had gone numb. Only a single stubborn impulse drove him to continue struggling; he knew that if he gave in here, he would truly be finished.

Though uncertain whether he could survive, he knew that if he fought there remained a sliver of hope.

Time had never seemed so slow. From the moment he was swept into the storm until now only half an incense stick of time had passed, yet Yang Kai felt it had been as if years had gone by, each breath a torment beyond imagining.

The Wan Yao Ling Milk continued to be consumed. At this point Yang Kai could no longer count the cost of wasting this Saint-Grade medicine.

Flesh and blood were destroyed and reborn; each rebirth made them tougher and stronger, able to endure ever greater harm.

After an indeterminate span, suddenly the raging energy around him weakened considerably.

Yang Kai's spirit jolted as he probed: he had been cast out of the storm's core and was being flung aside.

The worst had passed. Yang Kai's face lit with unbridled joy—he felt he had a chance of survival and forced himself to push even harder.

The storm's fury faded until it swept past and hurled him out.

Yang Kai was dizzy for a long while before he steadied himself, staring blankly at the storm receding into the void, and could not help bursting into a loud, hoarse laugh.

His laughter was ragged and weak, yet full of rejoicing.

In the next instant his soul trembled; his body went limp as if swallowed by darkness and he fell into unconsciousness.

…………

In the endless void Yang Kai lay quietly, lacking even the strength to flex a finger. Motionless, his body and spirit relaxed to the utmost as he sensed the changes in his flesh.

He did not know how long he had been out. A pain that saturated his whole body prodded him awake.

Though unable to see his current state, he could feel that he was in a sorry condition—far too much of his flesh was gone.

Pale golden Demon God's Blood swirled within him, bringing surging vitality. It erupted within his vessels into a miraculous essence that repaired his damaged tendons and flesh.

The Indomitable Golden Body was the wellspring for producing Demon God's Blood. After this calamity it seemed to have awakened latent power; droplet by droplet pure Demon God's Blood slowly formed, each drop converting into Yang Kai's life force.

In Mo Shen Fort Yang Kai had witnessed the Ancient Demon Clan's formidable regenerative power and resilience; their bodily constitution was several times stronger than ordinary martial cultivators.

This was due to their superior lineage—the faint presence of the Great Demon God's energy that flowed within them.

As the legitimate inheritor of the Great Demon God, Yang Kai's recovery and toughness exceeded that of the Ancient Demon Clan by an incalculable multiple.

His toughened tendons and flesh writhed without rest. Under the aid of the Demon God's Blood the damaged parts emitted a faint golden light; severed tendons knit together, becoming more resilient than before, and torn flesh was being repaired bit by bit.
