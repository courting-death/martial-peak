## Chapter 1847 — Sell Everything

Inside the Commerce Guild, a group of people looked at one another, still stunned and bewildered, but above all else they felt a rush of exhilaration.

Gao Hong asked in a trembling voice, "Chairwoman... do these deeds really include the shops along the entire Tenglong Avenue?" If that were true, the value of this single box of deeds would be simply incalculable!

Under Chairwoman Hua Youmeng's leadership, the people of the Commerce Guild had struggled for more than twenty years just to secure a tiny shop on Tenglong Avenue, and they did not even have ownership — only a thirty-year operating right; they paid hefty rent each year, and when the term expired Purple Star City would take the shop back.

Yet now, an entire box containing over thirty land deeds was being held in Hua Youmeng's hands...

That meant more than thirty shops, and they were contiguous, lining an entire street; any merchant could see enormous profit in that.

Gao Hong and the others were so overjoyed they nearly fainted.

Hua Youmeng's hands trembled as she checked them again; she looked up at the onlookers who had been watching her and said hoarsely, "It is real..."

Yao Qing laughed uproariously, slapping his bald head; he was so excited he could not sit still, his eyes blazing as he imagined the future. "I've long resented the neighboring Tianyuan Trading Firm for their constant malicious competition. Hmph — now let's see what they can do against us. Later I'll drive them out. And that Pill Hall — when Haitang and I went before, those Pill Hall bastards looked down on us and kicked us out. It infuriated me. Now their deeds are in our hands; I'll see if they still dare to drive me out. Haitang, come with me later and teach them a lesson!"

Haitang stood beside him, nodding her head vigorously; she clearly still held a grudge over the last incident.

"A man with a little success becomes arrogant!" Xia Jingwu glared at Yao Qing. Yao Qing offered an embarrassed smile and scratched his head, but did not dare to argue. Within the Commerce Guild, Hua Youmeng's prestige was the highest, followed by Xia Jingwu, the Guild's strategist; sometimes his words carried even more weight than Chairwoman Hua's.

Hua Youmeng finally snapped out of her shock and hesitantly looked at Xia Jingwu. "Uncle Xia. About this matter..."

He stroked his beard, not overly excited but frowning. After a moment's thought he said quietly to Hua Youmeng, "Chairwoman, the key to this matter lies elsewhere."

He gestured toward the room and continued, "Whether it was Commander Lu's attitude and the compensation yesterday, or these deeds today, none of it was something the Commerce Guild could have arranged — we don't have that capability. Since the key doesn't lie with us, Chairwoman, you might talk more with the person at the center; you might learn something."

Hua Youmeng thought for a moment, nodded lightly, and said, "Do not spread today's events. The Guild will remain closed today. Everyone, carry on with whatever you need to do."

Saying that, she hurried toward the backyard.

Before long, she returned to Yang Kai's chamber.

Yang Kai smiled, clearly already aware of what had occurred outside.

Hua Youmeng did not beat around the bush; she produced the jade box and placed it on the table before Yang Kai. "Sir, this is far too precious; our Commerce Guild cannot bear it. If we kept it, it would likely invite unforeseen disaster, so please take care of it."

After the initial shock and excitement, she gradually realized that Lu Tianfeng had the box of deeds delivered entirely because of Yang Kai; she did not know Yang Kai's background. As long as Yang Kai remained here, Lu Tianfeng would treat the Commerce Guild with deference and dare not slight them, but if the Guild lost Yang Kai's protection one day, those more than thirty deeds would certainly become the source of trouble.

An innocent man was guiltless, but possession of treasure invited danger — in Purple Star City, even in the outer districts, land deeds were extremely rare; only merchants with real strength could possess them, and the Commerce Guild was far too small to be entitled to any of them.

Would Yang Kai always shelter the Commerce Guild? Hua Youmeng thought that unlikely; after all, he was a Void King Realm expert — his helping them now was already a blessing from the ancestors; she could not expect his protection to last forever.

Yang Kai looked at her thoughtfully and said, "If they are meant for you, Chairwoman Hua, then accept them. These have no value to me; I gain nothing from taking them."

Hua Youmeng forced a bitter smile. "But..."

Yang Kai cut her off with a hand: "There is no 'but.' Take them and don't worry. Do not overthink it — I will bear all consequences."

Hua Youmeng stared at him, as if tasting some other meaning in his words, and could not help but say gratefully, "If Sir says so, then I thank you."

Although her cultivation was not insignificant, she was a merchant at heart; any merchant would find it impossible to refuse a box of deeds like this.

Yang Kai smiled and asked, "But Chairwoman Hua, how do you intend to handle these deeds?"

"Handle them?" Hua Youmeng was momentarily stunned, then said, "I have long dreamt of holding the Commerce Guild's deeds in my own hands. Purple Star City is worth every inch, and deeds are far too costly. Our original plan was to spend another ten years saving up Saint Crystals to buy deeds, then use one shop as a foundation and slowly expand the Guild by more than ten times. We do not expect to rival the Hengluo Commerce Guild — we only want to cease being bullied everywhere!"

As she spoke she relaxed and the flush of excitement on her face made her appear almost girlish. "This is not only my dream, but also Uncle Xia's, Sister Hong's, Yao Qing's and Haitang's. We have always worked toward this dream. Merchants wander the world, but who does not want a stable home? Now that this dream seems so easily achieved... with these deeds I can expand the Commerce Guild many times over, hang our sign along the whole Tenglong Avenue, and sell our goods across all of Purple Star City!"

At the thought she gestured animatedly, her eyes shining with an odd light, as if a beautiful future had spread out before her.

Only when she noticed Yang Kai smiling at her did Hua Youmeng grow embarrassed, her face flushing deeply; she whispered, "I have made myself ridiculous..."

"Everyone's dream is sacred — why should I mock you?" Yang Kai asked earnestly. "Chairwoman Hua, you must have worked hard these years, haven't you?"

"There certainly has been hardship, but with my brothers and sisters at my side, no hardship really mattered," Hua Youmeng replied sweetly, and Yang Kai became momentarily distracted.

Sensing his gaze, she quickly lowered her head, her heart pounding wildly, secretly fearful that Yang Kai might take a liking to her.

Then again, being noticed by such a promising Void King Realm man might not be a bad thing. She fancied herself perceptive; Yang Kai was nothing like those aloof, arrogant Void King Realm figures — he was approachable and not unattractive, with a heroic physique and a rugged face.

What on earth was she daydreaming about? Hua Youmeng snapped back to herself and wished for a hole to hide in.

"Hm, Chairwoman Hua, your plan is comprehensive, but may I say one thing?" Yang Kai asked, unaware of her inner thoughts.

"You are the Commerce Guild's benefactor — speak plainly," Hua Youmeng forced herself to reply.

"Don't keep a single one of these deeds — sell them all!" Yang Kai said in a low voice.

“Ah?” Hua Youmeng was stunned. She never expected that this was what Yang Kai meant to say. If things were truly to proceed that way, then all the plans she had just envisioned for the future would instantly turn to dust.

All of her dreams would be impossible to realize.

"Do you trust me?" Yang Kai looked at her sincerely.

Under that invasive stare, Hua Youmeng panicked and averted her eyes, then nodded instinctively. "I do, Sir."

"Good. I cannot speak of the reasons in detail, but you must not keep these deeds — it is better to dispose of them as soon as possible. One day you will understand why I ask this of you."

He had come to Purple Star City to steal the Star Emperor Token, and conflict with Purple Star was inevitable. Although Lu Tianfeng had deliberately shown goodwill because of the Respected Token and had sent these deeds, once Yang Kai's purpose was exposed the Commerce Guild would be implicated and could no longer remain in Purple Star City; the deeds would then become worthless.

It was far better to sell them all now and gather a large amount of Saint Crystals.

With Saint Crystals in hand, would the Guild still struggle to develop?

Though Hua Youmeng did not fully understand Yang Kai's reasons, after thinking carefully she had a faint inkling. She trembled slightly and nodded, "I understand."

Yang Kai looked at her with meaning and smiled faintly. "Chairwoman Hua, you truly are a clever person."

"I'm merely a woman; I will follow Sir's guidance. Um, may I ask one favor of you?" Hua Youmeng asked.

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked, curious.

"Could you accompany me on a trip?"

"To do what?" Yang Kai frowned.

"It's like this," Hua Youmeng explained, "there are simply too many deeds. If we sell them ourselves the Commerce Guild alone may not secure a good price, nor do we have the capacity to manage the whole operation. I intend to hand the deeds over to the Tongtian Auction House to handle promotion and auction on our behalf, which would maximize the returns."
