## Chapter 1857 — Friend, Not Foe

The youth in the room was none other than Shen Tu!

When Yang Kai fell into misfortune on the Floating Continent, Shen Tu had been there as well; at that time both of them were weak, only having entered the Saint Realm, and Shen Tu's cultivation was slightly higher, only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

The two had cooperated with one another on the Floating Continent and forged a certain camaraderie.

After escaping the Floating Continent, Yang Kai had even followed Shen Tu to Shuiyue Star, the Hengluo Commerce Guild's homeworld, and since that parting it had already been decades.

Yang Kai had never expected to run into this fellow on Purple Star, so he was very surprised.

Shen Tu stared at Yang Kai, unable to believe his eyes; only after Yang Kai took the initiative to call out did he rub his eyes hard and murmur, "Yang Kai?"

"Indeed, this is me!" Yang Kai chuckled.

"How are you here?" Shen Tu asked, frowning, astonished.

"That's a long story, Brother Shen Tu—could you ask these gentlemen to... hm, hold their horses?" Yang Kai looked at the four warriors glaring at him with ill intent.

Shen Tu gave a slight nod and growled softly, "All of you, stop! Brother Yang... is my old acquaintance!"

The four at the Origin Returning Realm exchanged glances, then withdrew their Saint Yuan; seeing no further movement from them, Yang Kai dissipated his Domain Field.

In an instant, everyone in the room regained their freedom.

"You've already reached the Void King Realm?" Shen Tu had been shocked by Yang Kai's sudden appearance and only now belatedly realized Yang Kai's true cultivation, his face full of astonishment.

Back then his cultivation had been a bit higher than Yang Kai's, but after so many years he had only reached the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, whereas Yang Kai had advanced to the Void King Realm—by comparison Shen Tu was understandably very shocked.

Breaking through to the Void King Realm from Origin Returning is no simple matter; throughout history many talented geniuses had been stuck at this gate for a lifetime, unable to take another step.

Any who could break through to the Void King Realm not only possessed outstanding talent but also required luck and opportunity.

"Just luck," Yang Kai said with a light laugh.

Shen Tu slowly shook his head. As the son of the Hengluo Commerce Guild's president, his eyes and experience were naturally exceptional; he wouldn't believe Yang Kai's claim of luck—he knew Yang Kai was being modest—but now was not the time to pry. He frowned, regard­ing Yang Kai gravely and asking in a low voice, "Brother Yang, you suddenly appear here; I will ask only once—are you friend or foe to me?"

"Friend... not foe!" Yang Kai answered sincerely.

Shen Tu's expression brightened and he burst into hearty laughter, stepping forward to give Yang Kai a bear hug and patting his back vigorously: "Brother Yang, it's been decades since we parted; I've worried about you so much!"

His sudden warmth made Yang Kai slightly embarrassed.

Shen Tu said, "Back when you took that warship from Shuiyue Star, I later learned that the warship had met with disaster and nearly all aboard were killed; there was no further news of you after that, and I felt ashamed and uneasy!"

"It wasn't your fault—just an unfortunate coincidence." Yang Kai felt the sincerity and his heart warmed.

When he left Shuiyue Star he had taken a warship at random; he had never expected Xue Yue to also be on it, and it was precisely because of Xue Yue's presence that the ship met its doom.

When passing through a Meteorite Sea the ship had been ambushed by a powerful secret treasure and was blown to pieces; nearly all the warriors aboard died, leaving only him and Xue Yue to escape.

It was also then that he had accidentally discovered Xue Yue's secret—that she was a woman—and the events that followed sprang from that.

After a while Shen Tu released Yang Kai and sighed, "All these years I've been trying to learn of your fate; Third Brother seems to know something, but no matter how I prodded him he wouldn't say. When I pressed him he even walloped me!"

Shen Tu ground his teeth, scowling: "That damned brat, no respect—if not for his stronger strength I'd have taught him a lesson."

Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he thought of how Xue Yue had been humiliated that time, stripped and tormented by him—asking her about it would be awkward.

"Well, at least I've finally seen you," Shen Tu exhaled heavily as if releasing decades of pent-up worry, looking much more relaxed.

"I've been safe all along, no need for you to worry, Brother Shen Tu."

"Second Young Master, this is—" One of the Origin Returning Realm men, who had been watching, finally spoke.

Shen Tu chuckled and introduced, "This is Brother Yang Kai; he and I once shared a life debt—hurry and pay your respects to Brother Yang!"

Hearing this, the men did not dare be lax; they cupped their fists in unison and cried, "We pay respects to Lord Yang!"

Yang Kai was a Void King Realm expert and, being on familiar terms with Shen Tu, they of course had to show respect.

Shen Tu stroked his chin and pondered, "Indeed—Brother Yang is now Void King Realm; should I address you as Lord then?"

"Brother Shen Tu, you're jesting!" Yang Kai waved his hand. "I'm curious why you're here, and... you appear to be under confinement."

At Yang Kai's words Shen Tu grew indignant and cursed, "Damn it—I'm just as baffled! This time the Commerce Guild sent orders to deliver a batch of purchased goods to Purple Star; who knew that once we entered Purple Star City we'd be detained. No matter how we asked nothing made sense—what rotten luck."

"Purple Star detained you without explanation?" Yang Kai was stunned; "Do they not know you are from the Hengluo Commerce Guild?"

"How could they not?" Shen Tu seethed, "I think those Purple Star people have lost their minds to dare lay hands on me; when I escape I'll command a hundred warships and raze Purple Star to the ground!"

A thoughtful expression flitted across Yang Kai's face: "So the fighting in the city earlier was caused by you making a disturbance?"

"Mm." Shen Tu nodded. "We tried to flee but failed and were captured again—how humiliating."

"Second Young Master, I feel Purple Star is in turmoil!" An ashen-faced elder spoke up.

"Why do you say that?" Yang Kai looked toward him.

"Just a feeling. Since entering Purple Star City I sensed something off, like hidden currents surging beneath the surface. And since they knew our identities yet still imprisoned us, they clearly intend to use us for something... Purple Star's power is great, but not greater than our Hengluo Commerce Guild; I don't believe it's mere accident."

Yang Kai nodded lightly: "I also think Purple Star may be undergoing upheaval."

"I don't care—right now I just want to get out of this damned place," Shen Tu said angrily, then looked at Yang Kai and asked, "By the way, Brother Yang, how did you come to be here?"

"Heh, I came to steal." Yang Kai smiled sheepishly and recounted what had happened.

The others listened with mouths agape, full of admiration for Yang Kai.

To dare infiltrate Purple Star's palace and steal showed courage and daring not common to most; to escape when discovered made them reassess Yang Kai's strength.

"But now I've alerted them; I'll have to find another way." Yang Kai rubbed his forehead helplessly.

"Brother Yang, can you leave this place?" Shen Tu asked.

"The outer layer of the restriction is severe—forcing my way out would be detected. But if you can draw their attention I can slip away safely."

"No problem—that's on us." Shen Tu grinned. "Brother Yang, after you leave help me deliver a message to someone."

"Who?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Shen Tu leaned close and whispered into Yang Kai's ear.

Yang Kai's face immediately showed a peculiar expression.

"I leave it all to you, Brother Yang!" Shen Tu said solemnly, cupping his fists.

"Don't worry, I'll deliver the message." Yang Kai nodded. "You all stay put—I will find a way to get you out."

"No matter." Shen Tu laughed loudly. "My status is different; the Purple Star folk won't dare do anything to me—unless they want to ignite a bloodbath between two great powers."

After saying this he suddenly shouted, "Murder! Murder!"

As he shouted he cast frantic looks at the Origin Returning Realm men.

The others immediately caught on and began shouting and wildly attacking, causing their Saint Yuan to surge and their energies to go haywire.

The commotion inside the room quickly spread outward; the Purple Star guards outside listening changed expressions and strained to hear.

Soon one of them cried out, "Bad—these people have gone mad, stop them at once!"

The guards hurried to act and activated the restriction, pouring into the room.

The instant the restriction opened, Yang Kai's figure flickered and he dashed out from the room, finding a hidden corner to hide in.

Within the Purple Star palace the experts still searched everywhere but found no trace.

After a long wait Yang Kai seized a suitable opportunity, used a spatial secret art, and departed calmly.

Although this trip hadn't gone according to his original plan, discovering Shen Tu's situation made it far from fruitless.

In the inner courtyard of the Tongtian Auction House, Li Nuo sat cross-legged yet could not calm herself, feeling disquieted.

"Who's there!" At that moment Aunt Chun Yi's surprised shout came from outside.

Simultaneously a man's voice sounded near Li Nuo's ear; upon hearing it she stiffened, but quickly a look of delight crossed her face and she raised her head to look out the window.

Outside it was pitch black, only a sliver of pale light appearing in the east.

Night had ended and dawn had come!

A smile touched Li Nuo's lips as she said, "Aunt Chun Yi, come back—my visitor means no harm and has brought me good news!"
