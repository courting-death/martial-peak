## Chapter 1071 — Outsider

After Yang Kai finished speaking, he knew he’d said it in vain. Zong Ao had already fallen into a trance; his expression shifted unceasingly, and his eyes were sometimes dull and lightless, sometimes bursting with radiance.

He was clearly in Enlightenment.

Yang Kai shook his head and didn’t disturb him, resuming his own recovery.

Ten Leaving Flame Pills a day—three hundred pills a month—with two to three tenths of them bearing Pill Patterns; such results were enough to look down upon the entire Star Domain.

Yet Yang Kai couldn’t feel happy.

Because even if he refined ever more Pill Patterns, it still couldn’t resolve Xue Yue’s crisis or his own. What he needed was merely a single Leaving Flame Pill that had birthed a Pill Cloud.

Each time he refined, Yang Kai went all out, not daring the slightest carelessness. He pushed all he had learned to the peak, throwing himself single‑mindedly into alchemy.

The odds of generating Pill Patterns soared. As he became more adept at refining the Leaving Flame Pill, that chance leapt from twenty–thirty percent straight to forty–fifty percent.

That meant that of the Leaving Flame Pills Yang Kai refined, nearly half bore Pill Patterns—of immense value!

If these were taken by cultivators who cultivated the fire attribute, their strength could rise rapidly, yet now Yang Kai discarded them like worn‑out shoes, tossing them aside without a care.

Each day after finishing a round of refinement, Yang Kai felt utterly exhausted.

A mere ten Leaving Flame Pills shouldn’t by rights leave him so weary, but the crushing psychological pressure weighed on him like a mountain, leaving him short of breath. As time passed, that pressure only grew.

He realized deeply how difficult it was for a Pill Cloud to form. No wonder Alchemists, when they occasionally produced a Pill Cloud, would weep and sigh over their heaven‑defying luck.

Now he too wished for fortune to descend upon him and relieve the urgent crisis.

Unlike Yang Kai’s impatience and furrowed brows, Zong Ao had been positively radiant these days, spirits soaring.

Ever since Yang Kai’s few words pushed him into Enlightenment, after emerging from it he discovered that his alchemy had improved by a large margin without him even noticing.

In the past, when refining dozens of pills simultaneously, he had to go all out to avoid errors; but now he could easily control the heat of dozens of pill furnaces, acting with effortless ease.

Moreover, by the method Yang Kai taught him, he too succeeded in refining Pill Patterns!

Though his rate wasn’t as terrifying as Yang Kai’s, it had reached a precious one in ten.

One in ten—out of every ten pills he refined, one could give birth to Pill Patterns. This was something Zong Ao had never dared to imagine before; now it was commonplace. Zong Ao had pride and his own stubborn persistence, but in this matter he was grateful to Yang Kai.

If not for him piercing that barrier for him, Zong Ao figured he would have strayed ever further on the path of alchemy and ultimately gone astray.

With that thought, Zong Ao found Yang Kai increasingly pleasing to the eye. He no longer cared much about having half his pill furnaces seized, and all day refrained from disturbing Yang Kai, instead familiarizing himself with the alchemy techniques Yang Kai had taught him and researching various spirit formations, choosing the spirit formations most suited to generating Pill Patterns and branding them in at the moment the pill took shape.

His harvest was immense; even his unruly, defiant temper had reined in considerably. He smiled all day, and everything looked festive to him.

When the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s man in charge of delivering medicinal ingredients and collecting the pills he refined came over, he could hardly believe his eyes.

In the past, every time he came here he was on tenterhooks, treading on thin ice—he would hurry to hand the ingredients to Zong Ao, then take the pills he refined and bolt from the valley like his butt was on fire, afraid Zong Ao would take out his bad temper on him.

Zong Ao had always kept a sullen face, as if he were owed several million Saint Crystals.

But on his most recent visit, Zong Ao actually wore a smile, even exchanged a few words with him, patted his shoulder in praise, saying he had worked hard these years, and in the end even invited him into the palace hall for a cup of tea.

The martial artist was so frightened his face turned ashen; he repeatedly refused, then fled in a panic.

He reported what he’d encountered at Zong Ao’s place to Halika, Lin Mufeng, and the others. They couldn’t tell what had gotten into Zong Ao and could only vaguely guess it had something to do with Yang Kai.

The few of them were very concerned about the progress, because if Lady failed to awaken, someone would have to be punished, and it might implicate the entire branch.

If the Young Master flew into a rage, it wouldn’t be impossible for him to assign them to a mining star to dig ore.

Yet they didn’t dare come to pry. Each day passed like a year as they could only wait for Yang Kai to take the initiative to send word.

That day, after another round of alchemy, Yang Kai’s expression remained dark and heavy like overcast clouds. He sat cross‑legged without moving.

Zong Ao came over, looked at the Leaving Flame Pills Yang Kai had tossed aside in a heap like a small mountain, and asked, “How many sets of materials have you consumed?”

“Six months—over a thousand eight hundred sets,” Yang Kai replied casually.

“Over a thousand eight hundred…” Zong Ao drew a light breath. “Seven or eight hundred Leaving Flame Pills have birthed Pill Patterns. Boy, to achieve this, you have every right to be proud. What more are you dissatisfied with?”

“I only need a pill that bears a Pill Cloud.” Yang Kai lifted his head to glance at him. “Even if all those pills had Pill Patterns, they’re worthless to me.”

“Is that little girl so important to you?”

“My life is bound to hers—tell me, is that important or not?” Yang Kai smiled bitterly.

“Life bound?” Zong Ao’s expression changed slightly. After pondering for a moment, he barked, “Soul Chain?”

“So Senior Zong knows?”

“Of course this old man knows. Only a Soul Chain can bind two people’s lives together—it’s a Soul Technique cultivated by one of the enshrined experts of the Hengluo Commerce Guild! No wonder when I examined her last time I felt an invisible connection between you. What is that girl to Ai Ou? How did you two end up like this?”

Zong Ao was, after all, old and shrewd. From the many clues, he inferred that the relationship between Xue Yue and Ai Ou was anything but shallow—otherwise there would not have been something like a Soul Chain.

Yang Kai shook his head; he didn’t want to say, and wouldn’t say. He only said, “Senior Zong, I think I’ve come to understand the meaning of what you often say.”

Zong Ao laughed heartily. “Pills are hard to refine! Others hear it and think this old man is merely flaunting his alchemy, but how many can taste the bitterness within? At least you brat finally get it.”

He looked as though he were finally no longer alone, taking Yang Kai as a kindred spirit.

Seeing Yang Kai remain silent, Zong Ao paused, then continued, “You have less than two hundred sets of ingredients for the Leaving Flame Pill left. In less than a month they’ll be used up, and that girl won’t live past half a year. What do you plan to do? Hm, have Halika gather more ingredients now—there’s still time. It’s just that even if you gather them, you won’t have many chances to try.”

Yang Kai sat where he was for a long time before saying, “I’m going out for a walk.”

Saying so, he stood up and walked out.

Zong Ao watched his back and nodded slightly.

Sometimes, when one has worked long and hard yet still cannot accomplish a thing, shifting attention to something else to ease the mood and nerves is undoubtedly the best course. Forcing one’s way down a dead end may succeed, but more often it breeds inner demons and a greater chance of going mad.

Zong Ao’s own experience was the best proof of that — after painstakingly refining pills for a hundred years, it still couldn’t compare to a single word of enlightenment from Yang Kai.

Only now, there was no one who could awaken Yang Kai. He truly needed to go out and take a look; perhaps he would gain some insight and find the right path.

Entering Xue Yue’s room, Yang Kai lingered for a while and checked her condition.

Since beginning to refine the Leaving Flame Pill, Yang Kai hadn’t come to see her. Half a year had passed, and Xue Yue’s state showed signs of worsening; the vitality Zong Ao maintained for her was constantly being consumed, and faint traces of frost had congealed upon her snow‑white skin.

Yang Kai knew that was the suppressed Profound Yin Moon Water exerting its effect again.

If he still couldn’t refine a Leaving Flame Pill that bore a Pill Cloud, Xue Yue would truly die.

Having Halika gather more ingredients was impossible; without finding the method, no amount of ingredients would be of use.

Leaving Zong Ao’s palace without a word, Yang Kai didn’t pay heed to direction; he drove his Star Shuttle and sped off at a leisurely pace.

He waded through famous mountains and great rivers, crossed jungles and marshes, and, from the vantage of an outsider, coolly observed the tapestry of life on Rainfall Star—the richness of the land, the endless emergence of martial artists, and even the prosperity and hardship of ordinary people. Yang Kai watched it all with keen interest.

Gradually, his impatient mood settled. The boulder that had hung over his heart for a year slowly vanished; he felt light all over and no longer thought of Xue Yue’s crisis or his own.

He lingered in one small town after another, leaving behind traces of his life aura and footprints wherever he went.

He watched great clans and small families come to blows over various interests, blood splashing and corpses strewn across the wilds.

He watched Sects recruit broadly; many low‑cultivation martial artists went to participate full of enthusiasm—only to be mercilessly eliminated.

He saw a group of people come to blows over a single Secret Treasure; the brotherhood of yesteryear wasn’t worth a damned thing as knives were thrust into backs and faces turned cold.

He watched those whose strength reached the heavens turn their hands to summon clouds and flip them to call rain, drawing others’ reverence.

In the wilds he caught sight of a woman bathing. Unable to resist, he took a few extra glances—then was chased across mountains and fields by dozens of big and little girls from some unknown Sect.

Yang Kai fled in disarray like a stray dog…

There was wine—he drank madly and got thoroughly drunk!

Yang Kai had never experienced such a free and unrestrained, carefree life. He no longer kept in mind seeking Su Yan’s trail; he didn’t consider whether he would be implicated after Xue Yue died; he thought even less of his friends and family on the Tongxuan Continent.

The entire world revolved around himself. He tasted an indescribable sense of release; a solitary, unfettered life left him with no scruples, wanton and carefree.

He felt he could do anything.

In a stretch of wild mountains, a martial artist of the Saint Realm was battling an Eighth‑Tier Demonic Beast—the Jade‑Eyed Fire Dragon. The man’s target was an Origin‑Grade herb, the Azure Blood Flower, which the Jade‑Eyed Fire Dragon guarded.

The battle had just begun when Yang Kai happened to pass by.

He didn’t meddle, merely watched from afar.
