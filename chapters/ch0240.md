## Chapter 240 — How Did You Do It?

“None of your business!” Leng Shan disdainfully brushed aside Zi Mo's hand.

“Just this once!” Yang Kai said with an indifferent expression. Upon hearing this, Leng Shan involuntarily exhaled, realizing she would no longer have to endure that unbearable torment.

“How did you do it?” After hesitating for a long time, Leng Shan mustered her courage to voice her doubts.

Previously, she had merely struck Yang Kai with the Ghost King Seal. After the Ghost King Seal returned to her body, something had appeared in her mind. Without having cultivated Divine Sense, Leng Shan did not know what it was, but she understood that the man before her had relied on this thing to control her life and death.

“I’m curious about that too. If it’s convenient, could you explain?” Zi Mo smiled charmingly, gazing at Yang Kai with sparkling eyes, her lips slightly pouting in a somewhat unconvinced manner, looking quite alluring.

“It’s very simple; you just need to plant a mark in your Divine Sense,” Yang Kai replied playfully.

The two women listened, their expressions turning pale.

Very simple? Although they had not cultivated Divine Sense, they knew how difficult it was to plant a mark in someone else’s mind. Not to mention that Yang Kai was merely a Separation and Union Realm martial artist; even if he were in the Divine Roaming Realm, accomplishing this would require considerable effort, and he would have to worry about damaging the other person's soul. A single misstep could turn someone into an idiot.

Yet, he casually said it was very simple?

Thinking back on what had happened to them, it could indeed be described as very simple.

There was no need to mention Leng Shan; she had sent out the Ghost King Seal and retrieved it in less than three breaths, and her life and death had been taken out of her hands.

Zi Mo had merely retracted a thread of soul attached to the Control Soul Insect, yet she had experienced the same fate.

Now that she thought about it, the young man before her had not left after killing Jin Hao; he had likely been prepared all along, just waiting for Zi Mo to take the bait.

How ridiculous that Zi Mo had actually run over eagerly. She had fallen into someone else's trap, completely losing her advantage and becoming his servant! At this thought, Zi Mo felt a chill in her heart, secretly regretting it.

Previously, when he mentioned refining the Control Soul Insect, he must have been forcing her to retract that thread of soul.

That was a thread of soul that had been tampered with in advance!

Staring blankly at Yang Kai, Zi Mo took a deep breath and asked, “Are you really only at the Seventh Stage of Separation and Union Realm?”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Zi Mo then patted her trembling bosom, forcing a self-deprecating smile. “I knew it. How could a Seventh Stage Separation and Union Realm martial artist do such a thing? Just how strong are you?”

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, his body trembling as an invisible aura radiated from him. The Primordial Qi within him surged and quickly settled down.

“Breakthrough…” Zi Mo and Leng Shan stared blankly at Yang Kai, just moments ago witnessing a scene that was clearly the result of breaking through a small realm.

But… this fluctuation wasn’t strong at all; it hadn’t even reached the level of True Essence Realm.

“I am now at the Eighth Stage of Separation and Union Realm!” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow at the two women.

Both Zi Mo and Leng Shan groaned inwardly. So he really was just a Separation and Union Realm martial artist! What he had said earlier was not a lie.

Exchanging glances, both Zi Mo and Leng Shan felt their faces flush.

One was at the Sixth Stage of True Essence Realm, and the other at the Fourth Stage of True Essence Realm; both were the pride of their respective sects. In their confrontation with Yang Kai, they had been swiftly subdued and had their lives controlled, which was naturally quite embarrassing.

With bitter smiles, the two women found themselves at a loss for words.

“You can move around. Although I control your lives, as long as you behave and don’t harbor any ill thoughts, I won’t make things too difficult for you. So, if you want to hunt anyone or any demonic beasts, feel free. When I need you, I will call for you.” After saying this, Yang Kai closed his eyes again.

Leng Shan and Zi Mo slowly retreated, stopping after backing away several dozen zhang. They did not wish to get too close to Yang Kai and give him any misunderstandings.

“This man is truly peculiar,” Zi Mo murmured as she gazed at Yang Kai from a distance.

“Hmph!” Leng Shan snorted lightly, recalling her earlier submission and feeling quite embarrassed. Gritting her teeth, she said, “One day, I will make him pay the price.”

Zi Mo glanced at her, suppressing a smile. “You better find a way to free yourself from his control first.”

“And you!” Leng Shan shot a murderous glare at Zi Mo. “I haven’t forgotten the humiliation from a few days ago while I was by your side.”

Zi Mo giggled. “Why are you so angry? I didn’t do anything to you. Besides, weren’t you enjoying it? Your reactions certainly didn’t fool me!”

“Vixen!” Leng Shan fumed, her face slightly red. “If you dare bring that up again, I won’t let you off easily.”

Zi Mo smirked disdainfully. “Our lives are now out of our control, so you’d better not harbor so much hostility towards me. It’s more important to find a way to survive under his hand. You’ve seen how he treats us; he shows no mercy at all. If he truly becomes unhappy, he will definitely kill us.”

“Hah…” Leng Shan sneered, taking pleasure in Zi Mo’s predicament. “You’ve got your comeuppance! How does it feel to be controlled by someone?”

“We are both women; why must we be so calculative? We should be working together now!” Zi Mo frowned.

Taking a deep breath, Leng Shan, though still filled with resentment, had to admit that Zi Mo was right. After a moment of hesitation, she asked, “What do you propose we do?”

“Seduce him!” Zi Mo’s face lit up with excitement. “He looks like just a sixteen or seventeen-year-old boy, younger than us by a few years. No matter how ruthless he is, he’s still a man. And every man has desires. We are not bad-looking; seducing a boy who hasn’t matured yet should be a piece of cake!”

“I think you just want to sleep with him!” Leng Shan mercilessly shot her down.

“Why say it so bluntly?” Zi Mo couldn’t help but roll her eyes, then suddenly chuckled. “But I didn’t lie when I said that. Women from Tianlang Kingdom naturally admire the strong. His realm isn’t high, yet he can control me; even my Senior Brother can’t do that.”

“You go ahead; I won’t demean myself!” Leng Shan huffed, turning away to sit cross-legged at a distance. She had been tormented by Yang Kai to the point of fainting twice and urgently needed to recover.

Zi Mo sneered, thinking to herself that once she conquered him, Leng Shan would understand that she was right.

This world has always been like this: men conquer the world, while women conquer men; it’s an eternal truth!

Yang Kai sat cross-legged, not immediately attending to his own matters but instead focusing on sensing the soul reactions of Zi Mo and Leng Shan.

Although he couldn’t hear what they were saying, this peculiar reaction clearly conveyed their intentions to Yang Kai.

Hmm. Not bad, both are quite obedient, at least they don’t harbor any thoughts of killing me.

Being able to control them so smoothly truly surprised Yang Kai. And all of this was thanks to the Earth Demon.

In Yang Kai’s original plan, he merely intended to refine the two Control Soul Insects to injure Zi Mo and then wait for an opportunity to kill her.

However, the Earth Demon proposed another, better method.

By mixing a thread of Yang Kai’s soul into Zi Mo’s thread of soul in a special way, once she retracted it, it would be equivalent to planting a mark in her mind, allowing him to completely control her.

After a final attempt, it indeed proved to be convenient and effective.

With this successful precedent, Yang Kai immediately set his sights on Leng Shan. The Ghost King Seal was a technique for the disciples of Ghost King Valley to cultivate life and death together, and it could certainly be used as a tool. The Earth Demon did not disappoint, quickly making adjustments to the Ghost King Seal.

Moreover, the adjustments made by the Earth Demon were very sophisticated, so there was no worry about being resolved by anyone. The soul was a fragile thing; now that the marks of Yang Kai were planted in the souls of Zi Mo and Leng Shan, if a master wanted to help them resolve it, they would also have to worry about damaging their consciousness.

“What a pity. One less vengeful spirit to absorb!” The Earth Demon felt somewhat regretful.

“I find it regrettable too,” Yang Kai said with dissatisfaction. “If I had known I could do this, why did I kill Jin Hao and the other disciple from Ghost King Valley? It would have been much better to subdue them both and use them as my subordinates.”

The Earth Demon chuckled awkwardly.

“You knew all along but didn’t say anything, right?” Yang Kai felt a bit angry.

The Earth Demon protested, “Such weak enemies are useless to keep alive. If it weren’t for the young master’s sudden enlightenment, this old servant truly wouldn’t have thought of it.”

“Forget it. It’s somewhat off-putting to take men as subordinates.” Yang Kai didn’t care too much.

After secretly observing Zi Mo and Leng Shan for a moment, Yang Kai finally immersed himself in his own matters.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai called forth the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard he had controlled, extending his hand to tap its head and shattering the Slave Beast Seal within it.

This Fifth-Tier demonic beast immediately fled upon regaining its freedom.

Yang Kai did not strike it down or pursue it. Instead, at Zi Mo’s command, dozens of demonic beasts were dispatched to chase it back and replant the Control Soul Insect.

Yang Kai paid no attention to her. He struck out the White Tiger Seal with his left hand and the Divine Ox Seal with his right, merging his palms and pushing forward.

The roar of beasts echoed as the Heaven-Shaking White Tiger and Earth-Splitting Divine Ox appeared simultaneously.

Attracted by this sound, Zi Mo and Leng Shan quickly turned their heads to look. Upon seeing the two vividly animated beast souls, they couldn’t help but gasp in astonishment.

They had never seen such a miraculous martial technique! It could activate one’s Primordial Qi, and those two fiery red demonic beasts were clearly not flesh and blood but were formed from Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi.

Just how rich and pure must his Primordial Qi be to achieve this? Wasn’t he only at the Separation and Union Realm?

As they watched in awe, Yang Kai sighed and snapped his fingers, causing the two beast souls to dissipate simultaneously.

After using them for so long, Yang Kai had also discovered some mysteries of the Beast Soul Technique: that is, at any time, the White Tiger and Divine Ox could only appear one at a time; it was impossible to summon a second one.

The Beast Soul Technique could be divided into two beast souls or combined into a Slave Beast Seal, but whether separated or combined, a second summoning could never be performed until the previous beast soul or Slave Beast Seal was shattered.

This might be related to the remnants of those two powerful demonic beasts left within him.

If Yang Kai wanted to practice the Slave Beast Seal, he could only shatter the two beast souls.

Continuously executing the White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal, Yang Kai attempted to find the secrets within this ongoing practice.
