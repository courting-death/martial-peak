## Chapter 2485 — The Bright Moon Rises Over the Sea

"Everyone, would you like to go deeper and take a look? The Origin Power inside is extremely rich and pure. If you can absorb and refine it, it will be greatly beneficial for your future cultivation," Yang Kai quickly suggested as the atmosphere eased.

Lan Xun nodded and said, "I was just about to take a look. Senior Brother Yang, if you don't mind, how about we go together?"

Since she put it that way, how could Yang Kai refuse? He could only nod and say, "It is my honor to be invited by the Princess."

Lan Xun smiled slightly and said, "However you address Little Sister Xiaoqi, you may address Lan Xun the same way. There's no need to mention the word 'Princess' anymore."

Back in the Four Seasons Land Lan Xun had met Yang Kai and found him far from ordinary. Seeing him again only reinforced that impression. Although Yang Kai was currently at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—one step behind Xiao Chen and the others—Lan Xun felt his future achievements would likely outstrip Xiao Chen’s.

Unlike Mo Xiaoqi, who lacked experience, Lan Xun's judgment of people was extremely accurate.

With that, the group set off together toward the depths of the Origin Sea.

They had barely flown for long when suddenly a burst of exclamations came from ahead. Immediately after, a dazzling light slowly rose from the Origin Sea, as brilliant as a full moon.

The fluctuation of Origin Power was incomparably clear, spreading out in an instant.

"Stellar Origin!" Xiao Chen exclaimed.

Yang Kai's eyes also lit up as he shouted in a low voice, "It's a complete Stellar Origin!"

After being in the Shattered Star Sea for so long, although he had absorbed and refined quite a bit of Origin Power, Yang Kai had never seen a complete Stellar Origin. All the Origin Power he had refined over the years was broken and incomplete. Although it benefited him, it was undoubtedly far inferior to a complete Stellar Origin.

When he first came to the Origin Sea, Yang Kai had heard that there were complete Stellar Origins within it.

He hadn't expected to actually see one now.

As soon as this complete Stellar Origin appeared, even Lan Xun, the daughter of a Great Emperor, couldn't help but breathe a little faster, her beautiful face showing a look of fervor. It was clear how attractive this thing was to cultivators.

But before Yang Kai and the others could rush to compete for it, countless cultivators from all directions had already flown over, their gazes locked on the complete Stellar Origin, chasing and fighting for it. The scene instantly turned bloody.

In just five breaths, more than twenty cultivators screamed as they fell from the sky into the Origin Sea.

And after another five breaths, the complete Stellar Origin suddenly disappeared. No one knew who had taken it. The remaining people were indignant and began cursing loudly.

"There really is a complete Stellar Origin here." Yang Kai watched the whole scene and couldn't help but sigh.

"The Origin Sea is an extremely special place. No one knows exactly how it formed or why it contains so much Origin Power. But throughout history, there has been a rumor about the Origin Sea that only a few know," Lan Xun said solemnly.

"What rumor?" Yang Kai looked at her in surprise and doubt.

She was the daughter of the Radiant Moon Great Emperor. There should be very little in this world she didn't know. Yang Kai had always been curious about the Origin Sea, so hearing her mention it piqued his interest.

Xiao Chen also looked at Lan Xun. Clearly, he didn't know the rumor about the Origin Sea either.

Lan Xun didn't answer immediately but turned to look at Mo Xiaoqi and said, "Little Sister Xiaoqi, you should have heard Lord Beast Great Emperor mention this rumor, right?"

Mo Xiaoqi's expression also became uncharacteristically serious as she nodded, "Before coming to the Shattered Star Sea, Father did tell me something. He said the formation of the Origin Sea is directly related to the fall of a certain great figure who was besieged and killed here back then."

"What?" Yang Kai and Xiao Chen were both shocked.

Although Mo Xiaoqi hadn't directly said who that fallen figure was, her meaning was already clear.

Heaven Devouring Great Emperor!

Who else could it be but him?

Lan Xun said, "Back then, that great figure rampaged through the Star Realm, invincible and unrestrained. He even broke through the barriers between worlds and went to those lower Star Domains, leaving destruction in his wake. Star Domains perished, stars shattered, and the Stellar Origins of those Cultivation Stars were all devoured. He destroyed no fewer than a dozen Star Domains with his own hands. One can imagine how many Stellar Origins he devoured. Later, during the battle of the Great Emperors in the Shattered Star Sea, he was killed. After his death, the Origin Power he had devoured mysteriously remained, forming this vast Origin Sea."

"Is that true?" Xiao Chen's eyes widened in disbelief.

Yang Kai's face also turned pale as he said in shock, "So the Origin Sea is actually the place where that great figure fell?"

Lan Xun nodded, "You could say that. However, the location of the Origin Sea is unpredictable, and it doesn't appear every time. So no one knows exactly where that great figure fell, but the formation of the Origin Sea should be directly related to him."

"No wonder there's so much Origin Power here. No wonder even complete Stellar Origins exist." Yang Kai sighed a few times, and all his doubts from these days were suddenly cleared up.

He had been wondering how such a strange place as the Origin Sea could exist in the ruined Shattered Star Sea, but after hearing Lan Xun's explanation, he finally understood why.

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor devoured countless Origins, and after his death, those Origins remained, giving rise to the Origin Sea.

In other words, everyone was now enjoying the legacy left by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Lan Xun smiled slightly and said, "It was precisely because of that great figure's lawless actions back then that many passages between worlds were sealed by several great figures using their divine powers. Experts from the Star Realm could no longer freely travel to lower Star Domains. Otherwise, Stellar Origins would not be so rare today, making everyone chase after them."

Yang Kai was moved and said, "But I've heard that there are still experts who can go to those lower Star Domains?"

When he was in the Hengluo Star Domain, Yang Kai had encountered an expert who had come down from the Star Realm. Fortunately, Yang Yan was there at the time, and before that person could cause any trouble, Yang Yan subdued him.

Lan Xun nodded, "Although the world passages were sealed, it's not impossible to go to lower Star Domains. My father said that every Star Domain has its own guardian. These guardians protect the entire Star Domain, preventing powerful external forces from interfering. The guardians can freely enter and exit their own Star Domain, but others who want to enter must find extremely dangerous passages. However, these passages are rare throughout the Star Realm, and most cannot withstand too much power and may collapse at any time. Those who want to go down can only cut off their own cultivation."

"Star Domain Guardian!" As Lan Xun spoke, a long-buried memory stirred within Yang Kai. He remembered hearing Yang Yan mention this term before.

Yang Kai had once thought that when he achieved mastery in cultivation, he would become the guardian of the Hengluo Star Domain.

He quickly asked, "How can one become a guardian of a Star Domain?"

Lan Xun shook her head, "I don't know either. My father never told me." She paused, then looked at Yang Kai suspiciously and said, "Senior Brother Yang, could it be that you came from one of those Star Domains?"

Yang Kai's keen interest in this matter inevitably made Lan Xun associate it with something.

"Junior Sister Lan, you are truly perceptive!" Yang Kai smiled slightly and did not deny it.

"Senior Brother Yang, are you really a cultivator from those Star Domains?" Lan Xun was a little surprised, and even Xiao Chen couldn't help but glance at him.

It was said that those who could come from lower Star Domains to the Star Realm were all heaven-defying talents with bright futures, always sought after by the great Sects and powerful forces.

Although there were indeed quite a few such people in the Star Realm, compared to the native cultivators of the Star Realm, their numbers were still small.

Lan Xun had only ever heard of them, never seen one before.

No wonder Yang Kai's cultivation speed was so fast. It seemed the rumors were true, she thought to herself.

As they spoke, the group had already reached the depths of the Origin Sea.

Originally, only a few Emperor Realm cultivators occupied this place, but now there were clearly many more people.

Yang Kai led the group to the small island where he had landed earlier, only to find it already crowded, with no place to stand. His face darkened.

Just then, a clear fluctuation of Origin Power suddenly came from somewhere.

"Another complete Stellar Origin has appeared," Xiao Chen whispered.

Everyone looked over and saw a beam of light slowly rising from beneath the sea not far away, forming the wondrous scene of a bright moon rising over the sea.

Before the Origin had fully emerged, countless cultivators had already swarmed over.

It didn't stop there. After that complete Origin appeared, another beam of light appeared elsewhere, then a third, a fourth...

In an instant, the sea surface was densely covered with these dazzling bright moons. A rough count showed at least a hundred, with even more still appearing.

"So many!" Xiao Chen was both shocked and extremely excited.

Lan Xun, however, frowned deeply and said uneasily, "When something is abnormal, there must be a reason! The Origin Sea has never had such a situation before."

Yang Kai also felt a bit uneasy, but with so many complete Origins right in front of them, who could remain unmoved?

"Master!" Liu Yan called out softly.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and said, "Let's grab one first!"

As he spoke, he exchanged a glance with Lan Xun and said, "Junior Sister Lan, let's split up!"

Lan Xun nodded, "Senior Brother Yang, be careful."

"You too!" Yang Kai nodded, then led Mo Xiaoqi, Liu Yan, and Zhang Ruoxi forward.

The situation above the Origin Sea was extremely chaotic, with people falling at any moment.

Ahead, a Stellar Origin was being fought over by four or five people, each seemingly from different factions. For a moment, they were locked in fierce battle, and the Stellar Origin was left unattended.

Yang Kai moved in a flash, arrived in front of the Origin, reached out, and with the Star Refining Technique, directly pulled the Stellar Origin over and tossed it into the Small Xuan Realm.
