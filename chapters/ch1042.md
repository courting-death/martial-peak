## Chapter 1042 — Coincidence

"Young Master Xue Yue, as far as I know you should have left yesterday—how come you're appearing here again today?" Beside the warship, Xin Rui asked suspiciously.

Xue Yue smiled faintly. "Something held me up yesterday, so I couldn't leave. I had the warship go on ahead. Uncle Xin Rui is heading to Emerald Star, so I thought hitching a ride wouldn't be a problem—after all, you'll pass near Rainfall Star; I'll disembark there."

Xin Rui couldn't help but frown.

Xue Yue regarded him and continued with a smile, "Uncle Xin Rui, there's nothing inconvenient for you, is there? I'm only asking to take a lift—does this warship carry something you can't let me see?"

Xin Rui's manner made him uneasy, and he instinctively glared back at him.

Xin Rui laughed loudly. "Young Master Xue Yue, you jest. My warship only carries supplies ordered by Blazing Flame; there's nothing on board you aren't allowed to see. Please, Young Master Xue Yue, go ahead!"

Saying that, he stepped aside.

"Thank you, Uncle Xin Rui." Xue Yue led his two followers inside; every martial artist who saw him became solemn and bowed respectfully.

"Search—see whether there's anything on this warship that cannot be transported out!" Xue Yue's smile never wavered as he sent the order by Divine Sense to his two subordinates.

"Does Young Master suspect Xin Rui of smuggling supplies?" one of them replied.

"He probably wouldn't do that, but his attitude bothered me. It's never wrong to be cautious."

"We'll find out as quickly as possible!"

The three threaded through the hull and soon found an extraordinarily luxurious cabin to occupy—such cabins were reserved only for the highest-ranking people.

The room Yang Kai and Xue Tong occupied, by contrast, was just an ordinary cabin where typical Commerce Guild martial artists lived.

Outside the warship, after Xue Yue and his party had entered, Xin Rui looked up and happened to see two extremely sullen faces standing by the window.

"He's come in." Yang Kai's expression turned as cold as still water as he looked at Xue Tong.

Xue Tong's face twitched; he had never expected to encounter Xue Yue at such a time, and of all things to be on the same warship.

"The Rainfall Star Young Master Xue Yue is headed to is a cultivation star under my Commerce Guild; it should only take about two months. Young Master Yang Kai, endure it for a while—once Young Master Xue Yue leaves, things will settle down," Xue Tong tried to reassure him.

"We have no choice." Yang Kai nodded helplessly.

Although he had never properly faced Xue Yue in person, he had once caught a vague glimpse of Xue Yue's face; the other would likely remember his general appearance. To appear before Xue Yue now would be to throw himself into a net. To keep the secret of that private trade in precious goods safe, he had already killed two thousand innocent people. He certainly wouldn't object to killing one more.

The two men beside Xue Yue were absolutely experts far beyond his ability to resist; Yang Kai felt tremendous pressure emanating from them.

He knew Xue Tong spoke the truth—this was the best course of action.

"Take this, Young Master Yang Kai. Pour your Divine Sense into it and you can communicate with me. If you need anything, use this to notify me," Xue Tong said as he produced a compass-shaped Secret Treasure and handed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it, toyed with it for a moment, and soon grasped its function and use.

He had seen such compass-shaped Secret Treasures many times before—people from Purple Star and the Sword Alliance used them to communicate. Only now did he possess one himself, and he couldn't help but feel curious.

"Alright, I'll head back first." Yang Kai said, stowed the compass, and went outside.

He had heard Xue Yue and the three others' footsteps pass by earlier; knowing they had gone far, it was safe to go out now.

"Young Master Yang Kai..." Xue Tong suddenly called from behind.

"What is it?" Yang Kai looked back at him.

Xue Tong hesitated as if about to speak, and after a moment said, "Young Master Shen Tu truly wishes to befriend you; he wouldn't do anything to harm you!"

Yang Kai regarded him, eyes deep, and inclined his head slightly. "I understand."

He suspected Shen Tu of selling him out because the whole matter had been too coincidental—anyone would harbor doubts.

But from Xue Yue and Xin Rui's conversation just now, he had learned that it was merely a misunderstanding.

When Shen Tu learned he had killed three of the Commerce Guild's martial artists, he showed no intention of pursuing the matter—this suggested he genuinely valued the friendship between them; otherwise some displeasure would have shown.

Yet he had not shown any—he was utterly indifferent to the deaths of the three Commerce Guild martial artists!

Back in his cabin, Yang Kai shut the door, sat cross-legged on the bed, and began to cultivate.

About an hour later, a tremendous buzzing sounded through the warship; the whole vessel seemed to tremble briefly before steadying. The ship slowly rose, adjusted its course, and the speed increased. After ascending several thousand zhang, it suddenly became a streak of light that shot into the vast Starry Sky.

Yang Kai opened his eyes and saw the scenery outside flying past; the entire Shuiyue Star gradually shrank into the distance.

Piercing the thick cloud Stages, the warship entered the star-studded expanse and headed toward the direction where Emerald Star lay.

Since learning that Xue Yue was aboard the warship, Yang Kai had kept to his room and been cautious—he did not let his power show even while cultivating, so as to avoid drawing Xue Yue's attention.

From the intelligence Xue Tong provided, Yang Kai knew Xue Yue stayed in a luxurious cabin on another deck, unrelated to the cabin on this level; nonetheless, he did not relax his vigilance.

After roaming around for so many years, caution and care had been the foundation of his survival.

Saint King-Grade Upper-Level warships moved at tremendous speed—many times faster than Yang Kai's Star Shuttle.

Compared with Star Shuttles of the same tier, warships always held the speed advantage. Although massive, the innumerable spirit formations inscribed within could greatly amplify them, and the Saint Crystals that served as power sources could provide the necessary energy.

In the Starry Sky there were countless drifting meteorites—some large, some small, some scattered, some amassed into vast Meteorite Seas.

The warship maneuvered in a most cunning fashion to avoid these meteorites and spare the hull from unnecessary damage; when avoidance was impossible, martial artists on the ship would be sent ahead to alter the meteorites' trajectories or to shatter them.

The journey passed without incident. Yang Kai cultivated in his cabin and occasionally glanced out to admire the enchanting view and ease his nerves.

One day he took out the compass, poured his Divine Sense into it, and contacted Xue Tong.

"Young Master Yang Kai, any instructions?" Xue Tong replied quickly.

"What are the cultivations of the two men accompanying Xue Yue?"

"One is of the Origin Returning Realm; the other should only be Saint King at the Third Stage."

"Origin Returning Realm..." Yang Kai's heart froze. He now understood how high a standing Xue Yue held in Chairman Ai Ou's estimation. The strongest guards in Shen Tu's palace were at best Jia Long, a Third Stage Saint King, yet Xue Yue had an Origin Returning Realm expert at his side.

In Chairman Ai Ou's mind, Xue Yue's status was evidently above Shen Tu's.

"And Xue Yue himself?" Yang Kai asked.

"He broke through to the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm ten years ago; what he is at now I don't know," Xue Tong's tone carried some lament. "Young Master Xue Yue is exceptionally gifted—among Chairman Ai Ou's descendants his cultivation is the highest; Shen Tu can only rank second."

"Impressive." Yang Kai sincerely praised. "Aside from the Origin Returning Realm expert beside Xue Yue, there are no other Origin Returning Realm martial artists on this warship, right?"

"No, there really aren't. Experts of that calibre are rare. On each cultivation star, the number of Origin Returning Realm cultivators is small; they are dispersed across the Star Domain and act as the backbone of each power. Escorting supplies is normally beneath them—only when transporting extremely precious goods would such an expert be dispatched to escort."

He explained and then added, "Are you worried about the ship's safety? If so, rest easy. The Commerce Guild's business spans the Star Domain and they deal with all forces. Even the bandits hiding on the Spine of the Star River or the fiends in the Abandoned Nest would not lightly target our Commerce Guild ships—they have uses for the guild as well."

The Spine of the Star River and the Abandoned Nest were two of the Star Domain's most wicked forces. Yang Kai had briefly learned from Shen Tu that they were deeply hated: they ran rampant across the Star Domain, seizing passing warships, pillaging their goods, and abducting crews—men into slavery, women into prostitution—their methods monstrously cruel.

Any warship would steer well clear of those regions.

At one time the major powers of the Star Domain had united in repeated campaigns to eradicate them, but those places were perilous and protected by overwhelmingly powerful natural formations. Every campaign cost the major powers dearly; although each suppression could temporarily curtail the Spine of the Star River and the Abandoned Nest, it would not be long before they revived and grew more vicious in revenge.

After several costly attempts, no one bothered with it anymore.

"Any ship bearing the Commerce Guild's emblem is left alone—no one dares touch it!" Xue Tong said with a hint of pride.

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded. Bored, he idly chatted with Xue Tong for a while longer before cutting the connection.

He sank his Divine Sense into the Sea of Consciousness, manifested his Spirit Body, and glanced up to study the intricate Star Chart hanging above his Sea of Consciousness.

While chatting with Xue Tong earlier, Yang Kai had specifically checked the positions of Rainfall Star and Emerald Star along the warship's route and discovered both were cultivation stars with decent Spiritual Qi—Rainfall Star belonged to the Hengluo Commerce Guild, while Emerald Star was Blazing Flame's home star. He began searching for Emerald Star and Rainfall Star on the Star Chart.
