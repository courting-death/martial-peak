## Chapter 2233 — The Ghost-Faced Person

None of the many yao experts knew why Yi Quan was laughing so happily.

In the end, Bai Lu stepped forward and softly asked, "Sir, just who exactly was that old man?"

She could see the old man was extraordinary, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't recall anyone like him in this world.

Yi Quan looked in a certain direction and said slowly, "Ten thousand years ago, the Holy War!"

"The Holy War!" Bai Lu's delicate body trembled, her beautiful eyes bursting with a terrifying brilliance. She exclaimed, "Could it be that this old man..."

Yi Quan nodded slightly and said, "With this old man taking action, that boy Yang will surely be safe and sound." As he spoke, he frowned slightly, as if worrying about something.

......

Divine Roaming City, inside the royal palace.

Three hundred zhang underground, there was a heavenly prison. The environment inside was harsh, unbearable for any human.

Although this heavenly prison was meant to hold criminals, it was basically never used, because in the entire Divine Roaming Nation, no one dared break the law. If anyone did, they would be executed on the spot, so there was no need for this place at all.

So the heavenly prison was merely symbolic. Many people didn't even know if it truly existed or was just a rumor.

At this moment, Yang Kai and several others were imprisoned in the heavenly prison, looking at each other through the bars.

Around them were the shouts and cries of captured martial artists, all proclaiming their innocence.

No jailer came to pay them any mind.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Yang Kai and the others quietly exchanged the information each of them had gathered.

In truth, there wasn't much information—just that this time Zhou Dian had led people into Heavenly Yao Mountain to capture the troublemakers. Basically, all the human martial artists training in Heavenly Yao Mountain had been caught, and naturally, Yang Kai and the others couldn't escape this calamity.

Everyone thought they were just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire.

With things as they were, everyone could only pin all their hopes on Gao Xueting.

This time, it was Gao Xueting who led the team into the Divine Roaming world. But after sending everyone into Heavenly Yao Mountain, she left alone. No one knew what she had gone to do.

If she got word, she would surely try to find a way to rescue them.

But with her strength at only the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, she might not be able to do much. Yang Kai only hoped she could notify Wen Zishan outside. If Hall Master Wen personally entered the Divine Roaming world, there might still be a sliver of hope.

Just as he was thinking this, footsteps suddenly sounded outside the cell. At the same time, a wave of Emperor Realm pressure descended from above.

In an instant, everyone fell silent, not daring to make a sound.

The footsteps continued inward, stopping at a certain spot. A hand pointed at one of the martial artists imprisoned in the cell and said, "The King has ordered, bring him out."

Judging by the voice, it seemed to be Deputy Commander Yu Man.

"Yes!" The jailer who followed quickly opened the cell door.

Yang Kai and the others all changed color.

For the one Yu Man pointed at was none other than Xia Sheng, the chief senior disciple of Qingyang Shrine.

Soon, shouts came from Xia Sheng's side, as if he was struggling. But after being taught a lesson by the jailer, Xia Sheng had no choice but to behave and accept his fate.

After a short while, Yu Man took Xia Sheng away.

Though Yang Kai and the others wanted to help, they were powerless. They could only silently pray for Xia Sheng's safety.

In the midst of their anxious waiting, only about a quarter of an hour passed before footsteps sounded outside again.

Yang Kai quickly looked outside. What he saw made his expression sink.

He saw Xia Sheng at this moment, his eyes dull, his whole body trembling and twitching, as if he had suffered some great harm. Led by the jailer, he returned to his cell like a walking corpse.

No one knew what he had gone through to end up so miserable. Seeing this, everyone felt a pang in their hearts, and Murong Xiaoxiao was especially overcome with grief, bursting into tears.

She didn't dare call out to Xia Sheng, only wept silently.

Yu Man soon returned, standing in a spot and looking around, then pointed and said, "This one!"

Xiao Baiyi's expression changed dramatically.

For the one Yu Man pointed at was actually him.

The jailer opened the cell again and took Xiao Baiyi away.

After they left, Yang Kai hurried to check on Xia Sheng and called to him in a low voice, but Xia Sheng was like a lost soul, completely unresponsive.

"Junior Brother Yang... will Senior Brother Xia be alright?" Murong Xiaoxiao asked worriedly.

Yang Kai shook his head. "I don't know either. But looking at Brother Xia, it doesn't seem like he's suffered any serious injuries. Maybe his spirit is just a bit unstable. He should recover after some rest."

What he was more curious about was what exactly Xia Sheng had experienced to end up like this.

If not for the seal on his power, he could have released his Divine Sense to investigate carefully. Maybe he could have found some clues. Unfortunately, he couldn't use any strength now and could only rely on his own observations and guesses.

He offered Murong Xiaoxiao a few casual words of comfort, but deep down he was extremely anxious.

Looking around and seeing no one paying attention, Yang Kai quickly ran to a dark corner and sat down cross-legged.

He tried to calm his mind and focus his spirit.

The seal in his body had been placed by Zhou Dian himself. It was impossible to break it with his own strength, unless an expert like Zhou Dian helped him.

However... Yang Kai had the Soul-Devouring Worms. The power of the seal was also a kind of soul force, so it could still be restrained by the Soul-Devouring Worms.

As long as he could mobilize the Soul-Devouring Worms, he had hope of breaking the seal and regaining his strength.

As for what to do next, he could only take things one step at a time.

Time passed slowly.

While Yang Kai was trying to use the Soul-Devouring Worms to break the seal, Shen Muji and Murong Xiaoxiao were also taken out one after another.

Without exception, their condition was the same as Xia Sheng and Xiao Baiyi's earlier. No one knew what they had gone through, but after returning, they were all dazed, their eyes dull, completely unresponsive to others' calls. Clearly, their spirits had suffered a huge shock and they could no longer maintain clear thought.

Yang Kai gradually realized that something was wrong.

This time, Zhou Dian and the others had captured seventy or eighty martial artists from Heavenly Yao Mountain.

Among these martial artists, their strengths varied, but everyone else was fine. Only the few from Qingyang Shrine had all been taken out.

This was clearly no coincidence! It was some kind of targeting!

Was there some obvious difference between those of them who had entered the Divine Roaming Mirror world from the outside and the others? Yang Kai couldn’t help but wonder. Otherwise, how could it be that everyone else was fine, yet only Xia Sheng and the others suffered such misfortune?

But no matter how he thought about it, he couldn't figure it out.

Just as he was at a critical moment in breaking the seal, Yu Man suddenly arrived at his cell, smiling as she pointed at him and said, "Take him!"

As before, the jailer opened the cell and grabbed Yang Kai, following closely behind Yu Man as they left the heavenly prison.

Yang Kai remained silent along the way, only constantly observing his surroundings.

This place was surely the royal palace of Divine Roaming Nation. The palace was decorated with utmost extravagance, yet it exuded a tranquil air, as if few people actually lived here.

Yu Man led Yang Kai around and around inside the palace, soon arriving before a grand hall.

Upon reaching this place, Yu Man stopped, turned to look coldly at Yang Kai, and said, "Go in yourself. The King is inside."

Yang Kai nodded, showing no intention of resisting, and walked forward. After a few steps, he suddenly turned back to Yu Man and asked, "Elder Sister..."

"Who are you calling Elder Sister?" Yu Man pursed her lips and smiled, full of charm. The jailer beside her didn't even dare look at her, as if afraid his soul would be stolen if he did.

Yang Kai also showed a dazed expression, his eyes flashing with a frightening light.

It wasn't intentional—at this moment, with his power sealed, he was already affected by Yu Man's charm technique.

But Yu Man didn't dare continue like this. The King was waiting inside. If she delayed important matters because of her actions, she wouldn't be able to bear the consequences.

So in the next instant, Yu Man withdrew her charm.

Yang Kai shivered and finally came to his senses, cursing inwardly.

If he hadn't been sealed, he would never have been so easily tempted.

Continuing from before, he said, "Junior Brother just wants to ask, Elder Sister, why did you only bring those few people over earlier? Are they different from the others?"

Yu Man pouted, "I'm just following orders."

"The King's orders?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

"You talk too much!" Yu Man's face suddenly turned cold, her expression changing faster than flipping a page.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Just asking."

"Hurry up and get in!" Yu Man snapped.

"Yes, yes!" Yang Kai replied repeatedly, stepping forward again.

Before long, he arrived at the front of the grand hall and pushed the door open to enter.

As soon as he entered, a faint fragrance wafted over. The scent made him feel light, as if he were floating on clouds.

Looking around, Yang Kai couldn't help but be surprised.

The grand hall looked just like a woman's boudoir. Every decoration exuded a feminine charm—pink curtains, pale red carpets, elegance mixed with nobility.

As he entered, a pair of bright eyes looked at him from the side.

Yang Kai turned to look in that direction.

He saw, a dozen or so steps away, a pink gauze curtain faintly revealing the scene inside. Behind the curtain, a lazy figure reclined on a long chair, those bright eyes belonging to that languid figure.

A powerful Divine Sense swept over Yang Kai, as if to pierce through his Spirit Body and dig out the secrets buried deep within.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, frowned in thought for a moment, then blurted out, "The ghost-faced person?"

He suddenly realized that the aura emanating from the person behind the curtain was exactly the same as the ghost-faced person he had sensed before in Heavenly Yao Valley.

This person was clearly the expert who had ambushed Yi Quan!

Yang Kai never expected that this fellow would actually be a woman.

Though he still couldn't see her face clearly, her seductive figure suggested she was attractive. Besides, her strength was earth-shattering.
