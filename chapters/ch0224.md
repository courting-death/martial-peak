## Chapter 224 â€” Two Blood Pearls

Jin Hao and that woman were both filled with immense regret, their hearts aching over Yu Chengkun's death. Fortunately, that brat from the Lingxiao Pavilion had fallen into the cliff and was surely dead as well; at least there would be a companion in death, making the journey to the underworld less lonely.

After lamenting for a while at the edge of the cliff, the two finally departed.

The cliff was too high, and they had no idea if there were any dangers below. They did not dare to descend to search for Yu Chengkun's corpse, leaving him to be buried in the wilderness.

Below the cliff, Yang Kai gracefully landed, his Wings of Yang Flame unfurling as he collected the blood pearl that had formed after Yu Chengkun's death.

As expected of a master from the True Yuan Realm, this blood pearl was twice the size of those from the Separation and Union Realm, measuring as large as a longan, and the energy contained within was even more abundant and rich.

When he had refined and absorbed the blood pearl earlier, Yang Kai had already tasted its sweetness. Now, seeing such a large blood pearl, his thoughts began to stir. If he were to kill all the True Yuan Realm Martial Artists who entered this place, how great would the harvest be?

By the lakeside, Yang Kai had discovered that there were at least two to three hundred Martial Artists who had entered this foreign land for training.

Two to three hundred blood pearls... Wouldn't he be able to easily advance to the True Yuan Realm? This thought startled Yang Kai, and he quickly calmed his mind, fearing that it might evoke the hidden killing intent and malice within him.

After storing the blood pearl in his Spatial Pouch, Yang Kai glanced around and swiftly departed in one direction.

This was a vast valley shrouded in mist, with steep cliffs towering thousands of feet high on all sides. Ordinary people would find it impossible to descend, and even those at the True Yuan Realm would not dare to venture deeper without understanding the situation below.

Yang Kai traversed the valley for a day, gradually familiarizing himself with the terrain. He couldn't help but feel a bit pleased; such terrain meant that he was the only one active here, without worrying about encountering any opponents he couldn't handle.

Moreover, along the way, he had slain several Fourth-Tier demon beasts, so it wasn't without gains.

As long as he had enough time to gradually grow stronger, he wouldn't have to worry about those True Yuan Realm Martial Artists when he left this place.

The valley was indeed immense. Day after day, Yang Kai hunted within it, reaping rewards each day. Occasionally, he encountered a few Fifth-Tier demon beasts, but he hurriedly avoided them, not wanting to engage in conflict.

After more than ten days, Yang Kai had collected over thirty demon beast blood pearls.

Finding a safe spot, he spent an hour refining and absorbing them. Coupled with the blood pearl from Yu Chengkun's death, Yang Kai felt that he had reached the bottleneck of the Fourth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, just a step away from another breakthrough.

His gains were plentiful.

However, it seemed that there were only so many demon beasts in this valley to slay. As time passed, Yang Kai found it increasingly difficult to encounter Fourth-Tier demon beasts, although there were traces of a few Fifth-Tier demon beasts. But Yang Kai truly did not want to fight them.

He circled the entire perimeter of the valley and gradually returned to the place where he had initially fallen.

After some thought, Yang Kai decided to explore deeper into the valley to see if he could find more demon beasts. If there were truly none left, he would have to leave this valley and seek other methods.

Yang Kai advanced rapidly into the valley and indeed encountered a few demon beasts, obtaining a few blood pearls. However, as he moved deeper into the valley, he found that he could no longer see a single demon beast.

Not even a trace of their activity remained.

With a hint of confusion in his heart, Yang Kai continued to walk forward.

Days later, while walking, Yang Kai suddenly halted, staring blankly ahead, his pupils contracting as a look of shock and disbelief washed over his face.

He saw an enormous skeleton!

Over a hundred zhang away, a stark white skeleton lay quietly on the ground. Even from such a distance, Yang Kai could feel an ancient and savage aura rushing toward him.

This skeleton was at least twenty zhang tall, its length unknown, with each bone shimmering with an ivory-like luster. Even after countless years, it remained resilient and unyielding. Time had passed, yet it stood firm in this place, not reduced to dust.

The sheer size of the skeleton made it unimaginable what kind of demon beast had once possessed such might before its death.

After being shaken for a long time, Yang Kai slowly lifted his feet and walked closer.

Upon nearing, Yang Kai discovered that there was not just one skeleton but two.

One was the enormous skeleton he had seen from afar, while the other was small and delicate. The two skeletons appeared to be connected, but upon closer inspection, they were not; the smaller skeleton was merely embedded within the abdomen of the larger one.

"These are two demon beasts that perished together!" Di Mo asserted.

Yang Kai nodded, acknowledging his deduction. Through these two skeletons, he could faintly see the hardships and bloodshed of that battle long ago. The two demon beasts, one large and one small, had fought evenly, with no clear victor.

The ferocity of the demon beasts had been ignited, neither willing to back down nor concede defeat. In the end, the smaller demon beast had torn open the abdomen of the larger one but was also severely injured and fell dead.

Countless years had passed; the wind and sun had eroded the traces of that earth-shattering battle, yet they could not bury these stark white bones, nor could they conceal the unyielding killing intent.

Yang Kai's shock had yet to subside, his gaze fixated on the large skeleton.

He could not fathom what kind of demon beast in this world could possess such a colossal size. Even lying on the ground, it stood twenty zhang tall, and that was only half of its body; much of it remained buried beneath the dust.

Every bone was so powerful and robust, and it must have been an extraordinary demon beast in life.

As for the small demon beast, what was its origin that it could perish together with such a formidable opponent?

"Di Mo, do you know what kind of demon beast this is?" Yang Kai stood for a while before gradually regaining his composure and asking.

"From just the skeleton, I cannot deduce," Di Mo replied.

Yang Kai reached out, gently touching the pristine, enormous bone. As soon as his fingers made contact, the bone suddenly crumbled into powder.

The movement triggered a chain reaction, and the exposed bones of the two skeletons began to crack, collapsing in an instant.

Dying here, buried here, but where do their souls return? Even demon beasts of such power could not escape the fate of death and the loss of their souls; it was truly tragic.

However, Yang Kai's brow suddenly furrowed, and he widened his eyes to search around.

"What are you looking for, Young Master?" Di Mo asked, puzzled.

"The blood pearls! These two demon beasts are so powerful; how could the blood pearls formed after their deaths be lacking?" Yang Kai replied excitedly.

"They have been dead for so many years; the blood pearls should be gone, right?"

"I bet they're still here. Do you believe it?" Yang Kai smiled confidently.

"The young master is wise..." Di Mo humbly inquired.

"This is a valley beneath a ten-thousand zhang cliff, shrouded in mist. I doubt those True Yuan Realm Martial Artists would come down here for no reason," Yang Kai chuckled. "Only I, being chased to the ends of the earth, would dare to take such a risk."

"But even if the Martial Artists do not come, aren't there still demon beasts here..." Before he could finish, Di Mo suddenly realized. Indeed, during these past few days, he had not seen any traces of demon beasts nearby.

If the Martial Artists did not come, and the demon beasts did not come, then the blood pearls formed after the deaths of these two powerful demon beasts would certainly not vanish.

Yang Kai had grown too lazy to explain further. With the conversation reaching that point, Di Mo would surely understand. A drop of Yang Liquid burst forth from his fingertip, transforming into a shovel-like shape as he began to dig down.

Yang Kai dug with great care, following the bones of the enormous skeleton.

Since the blood pearls were formed after the deaths of these two demon beasts, they must also have been buried in the sand and soil, likely lying beneath.

Clouds of dust were kicked up as Yang Kai quickly delved deeper, meticulously excavating every suspicious spot.

After digging down for over ten zhang, a streak of deep red light suddenly burst forth from the ground.

"I found it!" Yang Kai exclaimed joyfully, quickly and cautiously clearing the surrounding soil. When he focused his gaze, he couldn't help but be taken aback.

He had thought that such powerful demon beasts would produce blood pearls at least the size of a human head. Even if it were not that large, a fist-sized one would be acceptable.

But the reality was different; the blood pearl beneath was even smaller than the one he had obtained after Yu Chengkun's death, only slightly larger than that of a Fourth-Tier demon beast.

Could it be that he had misjudged? Were those two demon beasts not powerful existences?

With some confusion in his heart, Yang Kai continued digging and soon found another blood pearl nearby, nearly identical to the first.

Since the two demon beasts had perished together, their strengths were equal, and naturally, their blood pearls would be as well.

Furrowing his brow, Yang Kai weighed the two blood pearls in his hand and slightly activated the True Yang Technique, wanting to sense the energy contained within these two blood pearls.

However, as soon as he activated the technique, Yang Kai let out a muffled groan and involuntarily sat down cross-legged, his face filled with shock.

"Young Master!" Di Mo exclaimed in alarm, hastily calling out, but received no response from Yang Kai. In the next moment, he felt an overwhelming surge of energy continuously pouring into his body from Yang Kai's hands.

Moreover, this energy was not pure; it was mixed with a great deal of malevolent aura and demonic nature. This unmatched demonic nature and malevolence caused even Di Mo, an old demon accustomed to grand scenes, to tremble involuntarily.

Yang Kai's body shook, his meridians instantly saturated. The True Yang Technique operated uncontrollably, refining the impurities within this massive energy and then pouring them into his Indomitable Golden Body.

At this moment, he had only one thought in his mind.

What kind of beings were those two demon beasts? Why were the blood pearls they formed after death so different?

Other blood pearls were pure and could be easily absorbed by anyone. But these two blood pearls were different, containing far too much wildness and malevolence from the demon beasts' lives. If one did not refine them before absorbing them, they would undoubtedly become like the demon beasts, losing their humanity.

Could it be that once a demon beast reached a certain level of power, the blood pearls formed after death would be so different?

Yang Kai wanted to stop absorbing this energy, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not do so. The energy within the two blood pearls surged uncontrollably, forcing itself into him, compelling him to endure and refine it.
