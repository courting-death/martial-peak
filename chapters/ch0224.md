## Chapter 224 â€” Two Blood Pearls

Jin Hao and the woman were both filled with deep regret, their hearts aching over Cheng Kun's death. Fortunately, that brat from Lingxiao Pavilion had fallen into the cliff, which surely meant he was dead as well. At least there would be a companion in death, making the journey to the underworld less lonely.

After feeling a moment of regret at the cliff's edge, the two finally departed.

The cliff was too high, and they had no idea what dangers lay below. They dared not descend to search for Yu Chengkun's corpse, leaving him to be buried in the wilderness.

At the bottom of the cliff, Yang Kai spread his Wings of Yang Flame and landed gently, collecting the blood pearl that had formed after Yu Chengkun's death.

As expected of a master in the True Essence Realm, this blood pearl was about the size of a longan, twice as large as those from the Separation and Union Realm, and it contained an even greater and richer energy.

When he had previously refined and absorbed a blood pearl, Yang Kai had tasted its sweetness. Now, seeing such a large blood pearl, his thoughts began to race. If he were to kill all the True Essence Realm martial artists who entered this place, what immense gains could he achieve?

By the lakeside, Yang Kai discovered that there were at least two to three hundred martial artists participating in this trial.

Two to three hundred blood pearls... Wouldn't he easily ascend to the True Essence Realm? This thought startled Yang Kai, and he quickly calmed his mind, fearing that it might awaken the hidden killing intent and malice within him.

After storing the blood pearl in his Spatial Pouch, Yang Kai turned to look around and swiftly departed in one direction.

This was a vast valley shrouded in mist, with steep cliffs rising thousands of feet on all sides. It was impossible for ordinary people to descend, and even those at the True Essence Realm would not dare to venture deeper without knowing the details of the situation below.

Yang Kai spent a day traversing the valley, gradually familiarizing himself with the terrain. He couldn't help but feel a bit of joy; such a landscape meant he was the only one active here, without worrying about encountering any formidable opponents.

Moreover, he had slain several fourth-tier demon beasts along the way, so it wasn't without gains.

As long as he had enough time to grow stronger, he wouldn't have to worry about those True Essence Realm martial artists when he left this place.

The valley was indeed immensely vast. Day after day, Yang Kai hunted within it, reaping rewards. Occasionally, he encountered a few fifth-tier demon beasts, but he hurriedly avoided them, not wanting to engage in conflict.

After more than ten days, Yang Kai had collected over thirty blood pearls from demon beasts.

Finding a safe spot, he spent an hour refining and absorbing them all. Coupled with the blood pearl from Yu Chengkun's death, Yang Kai felt that he had reached the bottleneck of the fourth layer of the Separation and Union Realm, just a step away from another breakthrough.

His gains were substantial.

However, it seemed that there were only so many demon beasts in this valley to slay. As time passed, it became increasingly difficult for Yang Kai to encounter fourth-tier demon beasts, although there were traces of a few fifth-tier demon beasts. Yet, Yang Kai had no desire to fight them.

He circled the entire perimeter of the valley and gradually returned to the place where he had initially fallen.

After some thought, Yang Kai decided to explore deeper into the valley to see if he could find more demon beasts. If not, he would have to leave this valley and seek other methods.

Yang Kai advanced quickly into the valley and indeed encountered a few demon beasts, obtaining a few blood pearls. However, as he moved further into the valley, he could no longer see any demon beasts.

Not even a trace of their activity remained.

With a hint of confusion in his heart, Yang Kai continued forward.

A few days later, while walking, Yang Kai suddenly halted, staring blankly ahead. His pupils constricted, and a look of shock and disbelief spread across his face.

He saw an enormous skeleton!

More than a hundred feet away lay a stark white skeleton quietly resting on the ground. Even from such a distance, Yang Kai could feel an ancient and savage aura rushing toward him.

This skeleton was at least twenty feet tall, its bones gleaming with an ivory-like luster. Even after countless years, it remained resilient and unyielding. Time had passed, yet it still stood here, not reduced to dust.

The sheer size of the skeleton made it unimaginable what kind of demon beast had once possessed such might before its death.

After a long moment of shock, Yang Kai slowly lifted his feet and walked closer.

As he approached, he realized that there was not just one skeleton, but two.

One was the enormous one he had seen from afar, while the other was small and delicate. The two skeletons appeared to be connected, but upon closer inspection, they were not; the smaller skeleton was merely embedded within the abdomen of the larger one.

"These are two demon beasts that perished together!" the Earth Demon asserted.

Yang Kai nodded, acknowledging his deduction. Through these two skeletons, he could faintly perceive the hardships and bloodshed of that battle. One large and one small demon beast had fought evenly, neither conceding defeat.

The ferocity of the demon beasts had been ignited; neither was willing to back down or admit defeat. In the end, the smaller demon beast had torn open the abdomen of the larger one but was also gravely injured, leading to both of their deaths.

Countless years had passed, with wind and sun eroding the traces of that earth-shattering battle, yet they could not bury these stark white bones or the indomitable killing intent.

Yang Kai's shock had yet to subside, his gaze fixated on the large skeleton.

He could not fathom what kind of demon beast could possess such a colossal size. Lying on the ground, it was already twenty feet tall, and that was only half of its body; much of it remained buried beneath the dust.

Each of its bones was so strong and powerful, its physique magnificent. It must have been an extraordinary demon beast in life.

And what about the small demon beast? How could it have fought to the death with such a formidable opponent?

"Earth Demon, do you know what kind of demon beast this is?" Yang Kai asked after a long moment, gradually regaining his composure.

"From just the skeleton, I cannot deduce," the Earth Demon replied.

Yang Kai reached out, gently touching the enormous white bone. As soon as his fingers made contact, the bone suddenly crumbled into powder.

With one action, the entire skeleton began to crack, and in an instant, it collapsed with a thunderous crash.

Dying here, buried here, where would the soul return? Even demon beasts of such great strength could not escape the fate of death and the loss of their souls; it was truly lamentable.

However, Yang Kai's brow suddenly furrowed, and he widened his eyes, searching around.

"What are you looking for, Young Master?" the Earth Demon asked, puzzled.

"The blood pearls! These two demon beasts are so powerful; how could the blood pearls they formed after death be anything less?" Yang Kai replied excitedly.

"They have been dead for so many years; the blood pearls should be gone, right?"

"I bet they are still here; do you believe it?" Yang Kai smiled confidently.

"The young master is wise..." the Earth Demon humbly inquired.

"This is a valley beneath a ten-thousand-foot cliff, shrouded in mist. I doubt those True Essence Realm martial artists would come down here for no reason," Yang Kai chuckled. "Only I, being chased to the ends of my wits, would dare to take such a risk."

"But even if the martial artists do not come, aren't there still demon beasts here..." Before he could finish, the Earth Demon suddenly realized that in the past few days, he had indeed not seen any traces of demon beasts in the vicinity.

If the martial artists did not come and the demon beasts did not come, then the blood pearls formed from the deaths of these two powerful demon beasts would definitely not vanish.

Yang Kai was too lazy to explain further. With the conversation reaching that point, the Earth Demon would surely understand. He flicked a drop of Yang Liquid from his finger, shaping it into a shovel, and began to dig down.

Yang Kai was quite meticulous in his digging, following the bones of the enormous skeleton.

Since the blood pearls were formed after the deaths of these two demon beasts, they must have been buried in the sand and should be beneath the surface.

Clouds of dust were kicked up as Yang Kai quickly delved deeper, carefully excavating, not missing any suspicious spots.

After digging down for about ten feet, a thread of deep red light suddenly burst forth from the ground.

"I found it!" Yang Kai exclaimed joyfully, quickly and cautiously clearing the surrounding dirt. However, when he focused his eyes on it, he couldn't help but be stunned.

He had thought that such powerful demon beasts would produce blood pearls at least the size of a human head. If not that, then at least the size of a fist would be acceptable.

But the reality was quite the opposite; the blood pearl beneath the surface was even smaller than the one he had obtained after Yu Chengkun's death, only slightly larger than that from a fourth-tier demon beast.

Could it be that he had miscalculated? Were these two demon beasts not powerful beings?

With some confusion in his heart, Yang Kai continued digging and quickly found another blood pearl nearby, almost identical to the first.

Since the two demon beasts had perished together, their strengths were equal, and their blood pearls would naturally be similar.

Furrowing his brow, Yang Kai weighed the two blood pearls in his hand and slightly activated the True Yang Technique to sense the energy contained within them.

However, as soon as he began to circulate the technique, Yang Kai let out a muffled grunt and involuntarily sat down cross-legged, a look of horror spreading across his face.

"Young Master!" the Earth Demon exclaimed in shock, calling out urgently, but received no response from Yang Kai. The next moment, he felt a surge of overwhelming energy continuously pouring into his body from Yang Kai's hands.

Moreover, this energy was not pure; it was mixed with a great deal of malevolent aura and demonic nature. Even the Earth Demon, who was accustomed to grand spectacles, could not help but shudder at the unmatched ferocity and malevolence.

Yang Kai trembled all over, his meridians saturating in an instant. The True Yang Technique was uncontrollably urging itself, refining the impurities within this vast energy, then channeling it into his Proud Bone Golden Body.

At this moment, he had only one thought in his mind.

What kind of beings were these two demon beasts? Why were the blood pearls they formed after death so different?

The other blood pearls were pure and could be easily absorbed by anyone. But these two blood pearls were different; they contained too much of the wildness and malevolence from the demon beasts' lives. If one tried to absorb them without refining, they would undoubtedly become like the demon beasts, losing their humanity.

Could it be that once a being reaches a certain level of strength, the blood pearls they form after death become so different?

Yang Kai wanted to stop absorbing this energy, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not. The energy within the two blood pearls surged uncontrollably, forcing itself into him, making it impossible for him to resist or stop refining.
