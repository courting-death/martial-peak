## Chapter 1364 — Golden Blood

Having dealt with the Formation Talisman, Yang Kai picked up the jade bottle before him.

The contents of the jade bottle were none other than the Life Jade Nectar he had obtained in the Imperial Garden! However, according to Yang Kai’s estimation, this was a diluted version of the Life Jade Nectar.

To test his guess, Yang Kai opened the jade bottle and, with no stinginess, tipped his head back and took a drink.

If anyone else had seen him act like that they would have railed at his profligacy. Life Jade Nectar can lengthen a warrior’s lifespan and strengthen Qi and blood; it has the miraculous power to bring withered wood back to spring. For Origin Returning Realm experts with little time left, it is irresistibly alluring—just a single sip can extend their life by a hundred years. Yang Kai’s one gulp had nearly consumed someone else’s hundred years of life; it was sheer sacrilege.

It tasted pure and smooth upon entering his mouth, even carrying a hint of sweetness, like a spring from the mountains. Once the nectar entered his stomach, it instantly transformed into streams of pure energy that coursed through his limbs and bones.

Yang Kai quietly felt the changes within and allowed a look of delight to cross his face.

He discovered that the power of his Qi and blood was raging upward, his blood seeming almost to boil. Before long the tremendous Qi and blood reached a limit; the surplus had nowhere to vent, leaving Yang Kai flushed and strained as if his body might burst at any moment.

Yet he showed no panic. He silently circulated his arts, spurred on Saint Yuan, and guided the forces threatening to explode to converge at a single point in his body.

As the Qi and blood gathered, the flowing blood seemed drawn as well; all manner of essences separated from the blood and congregated there.

Time drifted by—no more than half an hour—when Yang Kai suddenly heard a soft tick from the depths of his mind.

He lifted an eyebrow, released his Divine Sense to inspect, and his expression trembled—then brightened with surprise.

He discovered that an extra drop of Golden Blood had formed inside him!

It was not blood coursing through flesh, but pure Golden Blood—the kind of blood that could be refined into Golden Blood Threads!

Yang Kai did not possess much of this Golden Blood. When he first arrived on Dark Star he had over ninety drops, but through the years of battle and of allotting some to nourish the Divine Tree and other uses, the amount had been reduced by roughly half.

Ever since he learned Golden Blood greatly benefited the Divine Tree, he had been giving it a drop every few months; prolonged consumption had been a considerable sacrifice.

Now that he had cultivated the Golden Blood Threads secret art, one drop could only be refined into a single thread. Even if he refined all his Golden Blood into threads, he would have only a few dozen, still far short of what his grand plan required.

Although he could replenish Golden Blood through arduous cultivation, each drop’s emergence cost him three months of cultivation accumulation—a fact he had already verified long ago.

He had not expected that the Life Jade Nectar could give rise to new Golden Blood within him.

This was not hard to understand. After all, the Life Jade Nectar, one of the Three Divine Waters, raises a warrior’s Qi and blood, and the principal element in producing Golden Blood is precisely this.

Keeping his surprise to himself, Yang Kai continued to run his methods, refining the Life Jade Nectar’s effects.

Another half hour passed and a second drop of Golden Blood manifested within his body.

Only when the third drop took shape did the Life Jade Nectar’s effect fully dissipate.

A single small sip of Life Jade Nectar could yield three drops of Golden Blood; the contents of this bottle would at minimum let him accumulate about thirty drops—almost enough to make up for years of depletion.

Yang Kai rejoiced and, spirit buoyed, drank mouthful after mouthful, continuously refining its power into his Golden Blood.

He felt no regret. Life Jade Nectar might be a lifesaving cure for those with short spans, but for him, anything that promoted the birth of Golden Blood was of the greatest value.

Even so, he could now be certain that the Life Jade Nectar he had was merely a diluted product; the true Life Jade Nectar must possess far greater potency, and it lay hidden somewhere within the Imperial Garden!

At the thought of that, Yang Kai’s heart burned. If he could enter the Imperial Garden and seize that Nectar, he would never again worry about Golden Blood—replacing all his blood with pure Golden Blood would not be an impossible dream.

With the tremendous vitality and restorative power held in such Golden Blood, even grievous wounds would mend at an astonishing speed.

In barely two days the bottle of Life Jade Nectar was drained. Yang Kai still felt reluctant to stop, but did not force it; instead he closed his eyes, held the Ethereal Crystal in his hand, and began absorbing its energy.

In the blink of an eye, half a year passed.

During these six months Yang Kai did not leave the stone residence; he occupied himself with only three pursuits.

One was cultivating the mysteries of spatial power by absorbing the Ethereal Crystal’s energy. The second was refining the Golden Blood Threads within his body. He now had several threads, and with his prior refining experience, the process went markedly faster.

Although the number of Golden Blood Threads increased, their potency had not changed. This was mainly because Yang Kai had obtained only the upper half of the Demon Blood Sect secret art; the techniques to unite more threads and transform them further were likely hidden in the lower half.

Yang Kai was not anxious—so long as the Demon Blood Sect endured he had chances to deal with them. For now, refining more Golden Blood Threads in advance was simply prudent preparation.

The third task was to accelerate the fusion between the Glazed Pearl and the World-Ending Demon Eye. After he refined the Glazed Pearl it had turned into a haze that wrapped the World-Ending Demon Eye; though the two resonated, their fusion progressed slowly, and with leisure Yang Kai naturally sought to hasten it.

Aside from that, Yang Yan would come by every few days with all sorts of strange and curious items, asking him to infuse them with spatial power.

The items varied in size and shape and were of bizarre form; he did not know what many of them were. When he once asked, Yang Yan only smiled without answering and told him not to worry—just pour spatial power into them.

Yang Kai shook his head helplessly and thought it was no wonder Yang Yan had said earlier she needed his help—this sort of task truly could be done by no one else.

In idle moments Yang Kai also refined some pills.

After all, with so many people on Dragon Lair Mountain in cultivation, pills were needed. Buying them externally was too costly, so Yang Kai had Wu Yi procure more herbs for him to refine. It saved expense and improved his alchemical skill.

In six months he produced many pills, though most were ordinary. Only on occasion, when inspired, would he craft a Pill bearing Pill Patterns.

Yang Kai found that as his strength increased his alchemy improved as well. Now producing Origin-Grade, Middle-Level pills seemed no great difficulty; once he advanced to the Origin Returning Realm, he might attempt Origin-Grade, Upper-Level pills.

The Artifact Spirit had long since awakened again; after its first awakening Yang Kai had it swallow a strand of Sun's True Fire, so in total the Artifact Spirit had devoured three strands of Sun's True Fire.

The scorching aura about the Artifact Spirit now exceeded what it had been when Yang Kai first acquired it by more than double.

While Yang Kai tended to his own tasks, the Artifact Spirit drove the forge’s power to assist him in refining the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl, sparing him the trouble.

One day Yang Yan once more brought a pile of miscellaneous items and had Yang Kai infuse spatial power into them one by one.

Yang Kai complied without complaint and followed her instructions.

During that time Yang Yan chattered about the movements of outside powers.

Because Qian Tong would have people occasionally send news this way, Dragon Lair Mountain was quite well informed about changes beyond.

Yingyue Hall issued wide invitations, summoning strong experts from the major powers to the main hall to discuss matters concerning the Imperial Garden. After deliberation they gathered fifty top experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, intending to force their way into the Imperial Garden to discover a path inside.

Fifty went; only half returned.

The remaining half all perished!

This had happened just four months ago. When Yang Kai first heard about it, he nearly bit his own tongue in shock. After pressing for details, he learned that the fifty people involved had accidentally triggered some kind of restriction. Under the shroud of the Imperial Might radiating from the Imperial Garden, they were utterly powerless to resist and were crushed to dust by countless jade-like hands, each formed from condensed Spiritual Qi. The half who survived did so only by relying on their own secret arts or by detonating their Secret Treasures to escape—otherwise, they would all have perished there without exception.

That lesson made a cautionary example; afterward no one dared approach the Imperial Garden. Even a force composed of fifty Third Stage Origin Returning Realm experts had no means against it, let alone others.

Yet the major powers did not depart; instead they left personnel behind to keep constant watch on the Imperial Garden’s movements.

Everyone speculated that perhaps the Imperial Garden had not yet reached the time to open. The conjecture had reason—before opening the Flowing Flame Sandland was lethally perilous, anyone entering would surely die, but once opened Saint King Realm warriors could enter it to temper themselves.

Who first proposed this idea could not be verified, but most people accepted it.

Those strong experts naturally had no leisure to remain here waiting for the Imperial Garden to open; they had their own pressing matters, so they simply left behind contingents to watch.

As for Yingyue Hall, the matter left them in a sorry state.

They had invited the powers in good faith to investigate the Imperial Garden, yet more than twenty Third Stage experts had fallen; almost every major force suffered losses, and the blame landed squarely on Yingyue Hall.

Yingyue Hall’s goodwill had been ill rewarded. Accusations from over twenty forces were not something they could ignore; they could only respond with caution.
