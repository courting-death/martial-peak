## Chapter 1192 — Enter to Soak

While the others were working to break the restriction, Yang Kai wasn’t standing idle either. He lent a hand from the side — after all, since he intended to share in the spoils later, doing nothing now would only give others an excuse to drive him away. So, under the crowd’s surprised gazes, he condensed a longsword of Saint Yuan, refrained from igniting his Demonic Flame, and calmly began hacking at the golden restriction.

His strikes were neither strong nor weak, only showing the standard a warrior of the First Stage of the Saint King Realm should have.

The others assumed he was bored, glanced at him once and paid him no further attention, though secretly they shook their heads with a sigh, thinking that no matter how he contributed, the Soul Cleansing Divine Water would still not be his share later—why humiliate himself like this?

If he truly attempted to seize it by force, any one of the people here could kill him on the spot.

The beautiful woman stood beside Yang Kai, deploying a Secret Treasure like a buyao hair ornament that swayed, transforming into countless fiery birds that kept plunging at the sealing, gradually wearing down its energy. She seemed unwilling to see Yang Kai toil in vain and could not help but urge, "Young brother, stop hitting it; it's useless. With this time you'd be better off leaving and looking outside to see if you can find your own opportunity. You're just wasting time here; with your cultivation level it's not easy to have broken into the heaven-and-earth treasure area."

She clearly thought Yang Kai had been absurdly lucky to have broken through the Heat-Flame Zone and reach the Second Layer's heaven-and-earth treasure area; to her mind, since he had such luck he should seize it, not waste time here.

With others' well-intentioned advice, Yang Kai couldn't easily accuse them of meddling; he only gave a faint smile, looking a bit foolish.

The beautiful woman's pretty face cooled at his stubbornness; thinking him ungrateful, she no longer paid him any mind.

At that moment, a warrior suddenly cried out excitedly, "The seal is about to break—everyone, give it more power!"

After his words, the entire golden semicircular membrane trembled more violently; ripple after ripple spread across it, layer upon layer, as if someone had thrown countless stones into a tranquil lake.

No reminder was needed—everyone noticed the seal's change. This barrier was indeed formidable. There were some thirty or forty Saint King Realm elites from the major powers present, and they had attacked for the length of an incense stick before it was barely about to break; moreover, who knew how many years this sealing had existed.

Had this seal been intact, the crowd likely could not have broken it no matter what.

The sealing teetered on the brink. Joy flared in everyone's eyes, and they increased their Saint Yuan output even more.

After another half a cup of tea, with a faint crack the semicircular membrane above the pool finally split open and vanished without a trace. At the moment the seal broke, an invisible energy emanated from the pool and swept over all present.

In an instant, everyone showed surprise, then were overjoyed.

Because at that very instant, everyone sensed a subtle change in their Divine Sense— it seemed their Divine Sense strength had strengthened just a bit.

Soul Cleansing Divine Water truly lives up to its name!

Excitement and expectation overflowed their faces. Normally they'd have rushed forward to snatch the treasure, but since they had just discussed how to divide the spoils, they restrained themselves and turned their gazes to Qu Changfeng.

Seeing this, Qu Changfeng smiled slightly: "Thank you all; we've finally broken this damned seal. I hope everyone will collect the Soul Cleansing Divine Water in an orderly manner. If anyone dares to spoil the previously agreed arrangements, don't blame this one for showing no mercy!"

He finished with a face as cold as winter.

Everyone hurriedly protested they wouldn't; Qu Changfeng probably hoped someone would break the rules so he would have an excuse to kill and seize their shares. Those present were elites from the major powers—they understood his intentions and naturally would not oblige him.

A hidden regret flickered deep in Qu Changfeng's eyes, then he brusquely nodded to a disheveled-haired male warrior at his side, "Go."

The warrior eagerly nodded, ran to the pool edge, Saint Yuan surging in his hand, forming a bowl-shaped vessel, scooped up a bowl of Soul Cleansing Divine Water, and prepared to place it into a prearranged Spatial Ring.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's eye twitched—he felt his heart ache.

Sure enough, the bowl of Soul Cleansing Divine Water he had scooped underwent an astonishing change before everyone's eyes: what had been golden liquid, once removed from the pool, immediately released countless golden energies that danced like threads across the sky; these golden energies lasted less than three breaths before suddenly dissipating.

The sight stunned everyone.

"Senior Brother Qu, something's wrong!" the warrior responsible for scooping cried out.

"What is it?"

"After scooping it out, it seems the effect of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water vanished," the warrior wailed, pointing at the large bowl he had formed with Saint Yuan.

"What?" Qu Changfeng exclaimed. Looking, he indeed saw the water in the bowl was no longer the thick golden liquid from before but had become a clear, ordinary spiritual fluid.

Although this spiritual fluid was still fine—even an Upper-Level Saint Crystal couldn't compare—it wasn't anywhere near as precious as Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

"How could this be?" Qu Changfeng's face flickered; he dipped a drop from the Saint Yuan bowl into his mouth to confirm it was merely spiritual fluid, without any soul-washing effect.

Not believing, he personally reached in and scooped a handful from the golden pool, and the same scene replayed: once Qu Changfeng lifted the Soul Cleansing Divine Water out, countless golden energies flew into the air and then vanished.

"Qu, could it be that the Soul Cleansing Divine Water can't be taken away?" someone guessed.

"It's possible. Otherwise, why is the pool's Soul Cleansing Divine Water fine, but once removed it becomes ineffective?"

"How could such a thing be?"

"I don't know either. I've only heard Soul Cleansing Divine Water is one of the three great spiritual liquids, but I don't know what rules govern collecting it."

"We likewise do not know."

The three great spiritual liquids? Yang Kai's heart stirred—he didn't know which three they referred to, but Soul Cleansing Divine Water was undoubtedly one of them.

Qu Changfeng's face was ugly now; hearing the crowd's babble, his formerly elegant bearing collapsed. He glared and growled, "If the Soul Cleansing Divine Water cannot be taken from here, then how are we to collect it?"

The group was speechless under his question. Earlier Qu had been in charge of dividing the spoils, and everyone had agreed and spared him no face; now that the Soul Cleansing Divine Water couldn't even be taken, the prior allotment was clearly a joke. Qu was visibly furious and humiliated—who would dare suggest they all go in together now?

Qu Changfeng wasn't stupid; he could think of it himself, he just didn't want to say it.

The reason he kept quiet was obviously to try to redistribute things to his advantage.

Others dared not speak, but the man who had looked cold the whole time spoke up for the first time: "It's simple—go in directly and absorb the medicinal effect of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water."

Saying this, he ignored others and leapt straight into the center of the pool.

Divine Sense couldn’t penetrate the pool’s waters — they were incredibly thick and murky, and the bottom couldn’t be seen with the naked eye. Yet it was clearly not deep, for the man who had entered was sitting cross-legged within it, his body visible from the chest up.

Everyone gaped and all eyes turned to Qu Changfeng. The warriors following Qu were furious, but though enraged, they dared not scold this man for acting on his own.

Qu's face turned as dark as a pot's bottom, his breathing distinctly heavier.

When he had allocated the Soul Cleansing Divine Water earlier, he had considered the man's status and face, granting him a full quarter; now the man showed him no respect, which enraged Qu.

Even Fang Tianzhong couldn't afford to snub him like this.

Qu glared at the man with a grim look, but the other paid him no heed, merely closing his eyes and sitting cross-legged, features trembling slightly with a faint joy—evidently already drawing great benefit from the Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

Others had already seized the initiative; many warriors were burning with impatience and could not wait for Qu to speak. Besides, judging by Qu's expression, he seemed to dare not voice his anger.

Many glanced at each other secretly, then simultaneously leapt into the pool.

Once someone led the way, others followed; everyone feared falling behind, and the scene descended into chaos. Except for a few warriors from the Battle Sky Alliance who remained still, the rest rushed toward the pool.

The pool was quite large, easily spacious enough to hold dozens of people. Although the Soul Cleansing Divine Water seemed abundant, only a portion of it contained the medicinal essence, so everyone who leapt in was intent on seizing the most advantageous position.

The most advantageous spot was naturally the center.

Among the first dozen or so to jump in, five or six landed in central positions.

But the man with the cold expression suddenly opened his eyes and swung his fists twice with terrifying speed. The two blows seemed to suck the air from the entire chamber; the ferocious punch force sent those five or six flying, each spitting blood midair, and on landing they looked horrified and listless.

They knew the man was not to be trifled with, but had not expected him to be so ferocious!

Facing many, he repelled them with two offhand blows; though there was a hint of surprise attack, he had clearly held back—no one doubted that. If he had intended to kill, at least half of those five or six would have died.

"Anyone within three zhang of me will be killed!" he said coldly after the two punches, then closed his eyes again.

He intended to monopolize the center's three-zhang radius all by himself.
