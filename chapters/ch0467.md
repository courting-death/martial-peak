## Chapter 467 — Long Time No See

Yang Kai’s expression flickered in surprise, then his gaze sharpened like a sword, an unmatched Divine Sense condensed into a single point, scanning around the treasure.

In the next moment, the long sword in his hand slashed toward a direction, the momentum like a raging rainbow.

In that direction, a blurry figure appeared, grabbed the treasure, and transformed into a streak of brilliant light, disappearing thousands of zhang in an instant.

The speed was absurdly fast—so fast that Yang Kai didn’t even have time to launch another attack.

The sudden turn of events happened quickly and ended just as fast. By the time the mysterious expert snatched the treasure and vanished from everyone’s sight, the other five Yang Family members were still hesitating about whether to charge after him.

On Po Jing Lake, the crimson water spilled and scattered; that rainbow light had long since disappeared.

Yang Kai hovered in midair, holding the Shura Sword, his expression shifting subtly.

It was the second time—twice in one day! This person had slipped away from under his very eyes, and in broad daylight!

So strange, so mysterious!

He reached out, catching something drifting down from the air. Upon seeing it clearly, Yang Kai’s expression turned startled.

He quickly tucked the object away and returned to his faction.

No one knew exactly what he had grabbed from the endless lake water, but everyone witnessed his action and instantly buzzed with speculation, their curiosity overwhelming.

The six members of the Yang Family sized each other up again; however, looking into each other’s eyes, none showed a trace of delight. Instead, they all suspected one another, each convinced this mysterious expert must have been recruited by someone else.

The treasure snatching battle was nearing its end—eight Mystery-Grade treasures had been settled, leaving only a handful of Heaven-Grade treasures still contested.

After half a cup of tea’s time, everything quieted down. Martial artists from the six major factions fought and retreated, each returning to their own positions.

Just as at the start, the six camps stood evenly spaced by the shore of Po Jing Lake. Yet, every faction had lost at least a quarter of their numbers, including several Divine Roaming Realm masters among their casualties.

The greatest losses were suffered by Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying’s factions. When the third batch of treasures appeared, their forces were caught off guard and ambushed. As time passed, their disadvantage only seemed to grow. Fortunately, the battle didn’t last long; otherwise, total annihilation might have occurred.

Each martial artist had unleashed their true power, glaring fiercely at one another with mutual hatred. Holding grudges was natural in a succession war. During such a war, private retaliation was forbidden, but once it ended, all sides with grudges were bound for a life-or-death showdown.

Hence, even with the treasure-hunting over, the battlefield still reeked of lingering gunpowder.

Yang Kai’s side suffered some losses as well, but their gains were greater! Compared to others, their faction had secured noticeably more treasures.

Most notably, Yang Kai alone had obtained two Mystery-Grade treasures, more valuable than any other.

Yang Wei stood with his hands behind his back, nodding slightly to everyone, then led his group and the treasures back triumphant. Shortly after, Yang Zhao and Yang Kang left together, while Yang Shen and Yang Ying withdrew unwillingly.

After the grand battle, no one had the heart to stir up trouble further.

“Ying Jiu, how’s your condition?” Yang Kai glanced at Ying Jiu, who had been sitting cross-legged on the ground since being afflicted by the Sealing Yuan Curse.

Ying Jiu slowly shook his head. “I can’t summon any True Yuan. My meridians are sealed; it will take at least two months to break through.”

When a Divine Roaming Realm master is tampered with, even Blood Servants can’t easily dispel it.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow slightly. Ying Jiu’s True Yuan being sealed was a grave loss. Like a shadow, he was a formidable deterrent to any opponent.

Now that deterrent was gone; Yang Kai could only rely on Qu Gaoyi and Xiao Shun. Though strong, neither matched Ying Jiu’s prowess in covert assassination.

He could only hope Meng Wuya might have a way to break the curse once they returned. If even Shopkeeper Meng was powerless, then Ying Jiu would be sidelined for two whole months.

“Let’s head back,” Yang Kai said calmly.

“Here, this is for you!” Dong Qinghan stepped forward, handing Yang Kai a small sword about the length of a palm. It was the Divine Soul Treasure Yang Kai had eyed earlier.

“Got it?” Yang Kai smiled slightly, taking it without hesitation. The sword was icy cold to the touch. Divine Sense sensing confirmed that it perfectly matched his Divine Sense power. Once refined, it would exert tremendous effect.

“With your help, cousin, how could we fail?” Dong Fatty patted his chest, grinning broadly. “That Lü Song still wanted to go against me—hah! He should take a good look in the mirror at his own ability.”

He paused, adding, “But I really have to thank a certain lady for this treasure acquisition.”

“A lady?” Yang Kai toyed with the small sword, curious.

“Yeah.” Dong Qinghan’s face showed vague recollection, “I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere, but can’t quite place it. She was the one who threw this to me.”

“Which faction is she from?” Yang Kai immediately asked.

“Just a bystander.”

“Pretty?” Huo Xingchen’s face lit up at the mention of a woman, and he leered, eager to know more.

“Not only pretty, but a bit charming!” Dong Qinghan’s expression suggested unsaid meanings as he chuckled. “And she has a twin! There’s another just like her nearby. Lü Song’s strength isn’t low either—seventh stage of the True Yuan Realm—and she knocked down several of his men with a single strike. That lady is truly formidable.”

“Twins?” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly rose several octaves. “What kind of twins?”

For some reason, he immediately thought of the Jiao-Mei twins. In truth, the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower people should have already arrived at his mansion, yet no sign had appeared. This made Yang Kai suspect the Jiao-Mei twins were sulking at him. After all, when parting at Taifang Mountain, Hu Jiao’er’s attitude hadn’t been all that kind.

Dong Qinghan hesitated, unsure how to describe it, before pointing somewhere. “They were over there watching the commotion just a moment ago, but now I don’t know where they’ve run off to.”

The treasure battle had ended, and the spectators naturally dispersed. Large groups were pushing into War City.

Yang Kai glanced toward the direction indicated but didn’t find who he sought. He quickly spread his Divine Sense, instantly detecting every movement within a twenty-li radius.

As soon as his Divine Sense spread, he detected two distinctly different life auras.

Everyone’s life aura is unique; even when similar, there are essential differences, much like the countless faces of living beings.

Yet these two shared identical life auras, as if cast from the same mold. Under Yang Kai’s probing, not only were their life auras the same, but their True Yuans seemed to intertwine and merge. A mysterious law enveloped them, binding them as one.

Found them!

Yang Kai grinned widely, his figure flashing as he darted forward.

“What are you doing?” Huo Xingchen exclaimed, startled. Though reckless by nature, even he was shocked, quickly commanding, “Keep up! Follow him!”

As a Yang Family disciple in the succession war, never at any time should one act alone, lest they become a target.

Everyone responded swiftly, clutching their looted treasures, and followed Yang Kai’s lead.

Among the retreating crowd toward War City, a man and two women were hurrying back.

The man’s face bore a lingering expression of excitement, relishing the great battle just witnessed, blood boiling with the desire to personally join and quench his fighting thirst.

The two women were silent, serene in expression.

Their delicate appearances caught the eyes of nearby martial artists, who repeatedly glanced their way. The two women remained indifferent, seemingly accustomed to the attention—neither annoyed nor pleased.

Their docile demeanor sparked lust and greed in many, some considering whether approaching them might lead to unexpected gains.

“Jiao’er, Mei’er, a few people nearby keep staring at us. Should we deal with them?” the man whispered.

Hu Jiao’er’s beautiful eyes flickered with disgust and helplessness as she shook her head gently. “Better not. Let’s just head back to War City.”

Yang Kai was still behind; any conflict now would surely be noticed.

Seemingly noticing their exchange, those few readied themselves, their eyes lighting up, sensing she was unwilling to stir trouble.

Not wanting trouble clearly meant no backing. These three looked young, weak—easy targets.

One young man stepped forward with a smile, trying to appear mature and reliable. Before he could say a word, a figure suddenly dropped down before him, blocking his way.

Not only did this person block him, but also the sisters of the Hu family and Fang Ziqi’s path.

The three instinctively summoned True Yuan, curiously sizing up the newcomer.

Upon seeing the visitor's face, Hu Jiao’er’s expression turned awkward, while Hu Mei’er smiled coyly.

That smile caught the young man’s attention, weakening his resolve. He bravely snapped, “Who are you?”

Yang Kai turned his head to glance at him.

“Y-Young M-Master…” The young man immediately went pale, stumbling over his words.

“Is there something you need?” Yang Kai frowned.

“No, no, Master, you seem busy!” The youth then panicked and fled in chaos, rolling on the ground with his companions.

They had witnessed Yang Kai’s battle with Liu Qingyao earlier. Not only was he personally powerful, but he commanded many masters. How could a third-rate nobody like them compare?

Fearing death, they fled in terror.

“Brother Yang!” After they left, Fang Ziqi smiled slightly and greeted with a fist salute.

“Brother Fang, long time no see.”

Since parting at Taifang Mountain, Fang Ziqi had promised to join the succession war for the fun of it. Meeting him now didn’t surprise Yang Kai. At Taifang Mountain, whether Fengyu Tower or Blood Battle Gang members stood firmly on his side, nearly clashing with the Xiang Nan factions. So Yang Kai had a good impression of Fang Ziqi.
