## Chapter 1584 — You Underestimate Me

The risk to bear was not small, but by using the Inner Core, a yao cultivator’s strength could increase tremendously.

That Xue Lian spat out his Inner Core at this moment showed how far his madness had gone; no wonder Ba He and the others were so terrified.

Xue Lian's status was extraordinary—if he used his Inner Core yet still fell to Yang Kai, the Lord of the Blood Jiao would never let it drop; he was a top-tier expert whose strength was in no way inferior to Chi Yue's, and if he flew into rage the whole of Di Chen would be plunged into darkness!

But if Xue Lian won, given how unhinged he was now, Yang Kai's fate would certainly be far from good.

How could Ba He, Yu Xiong and Shan Qingluo stand idly by?

Therefore, in any case, they had to stop Xue Lian before he unleashed the primordial power contained within his Inner Core! Only then could a great disaster be reduced to a small one, and a small one be made to vanish.

The three moved with remarkable speed; they had been separated by only a hundred zhang, and with their level they arrived at the battlefield in an instant.

Ba He opened his mouth, intending to act as peacemaker and urge them to stop, but before a word left him a high, resonant cry issued from Yang Kai's body, and as the sound rose a bewildering power spread out.

Even someone as mighty as Ba He felt a tremor run through his heart.

The words at his lips stuck in his throat; he stared at Yang Kai in horror, the corner of his eye twitching.

If he had not heard wrongly, that high, ringing cry just now should have been...

"Dragon's Roar!" In her bedchamber, Chi Yue's complexion drained; she sprang up, her beautiful eyes lighting with an unusual sheen, as if she had discovered something extraordinary.

Even at her cultivation of the Second Stage Void King Realm, when that sound came she still broke out in gooseflesh—that instinctive reverence had nothing to do with cultivation level.

Chi Yue bore a trace of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider bloodline, which was how she could cultivate to the Void King Stage; that was also why she placed such hope in Shan Qingluo, who had absorbed the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider's primordial power, and did not hesitate, with the status of a Lady, to take Shan Qingluo as her adopted daughter and train her vigorously.

She hoped that one day Shan Qingluo could restore the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider's majesty to the world and let its ancestral might be seen again.

The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider is an ancient aberrant species, an extremely terrifying demonic beast.

Yet compared with the legendary Ancient Divine Spirits, it still fell short.

Among the Ancient Divine Spirits, the dragon and the phoenix are supreme!

Unfortunately, such powerful Divine Spirits had long vanished into the river of history. Only the oldest ancient texts still recorded glimpses of their heaven-shrouding forms and the exaggerated tales surrounding them.

Those Ancient Divine Spirits, strictly speaking, were also yao—only they were born yao emperors, beings every yao would bow before.

Chi Yue believed those Ancient Divine Spirits had long gone extinct.

Yet in her palace she suddenly heard the purest dragon's roar.

It shot up to the nine heavens, deafening, causing even the faint Heavenly Moon Demon Spider bloodline within her to tremble in fear.

She no longer hesitated; she flashed from the bedchamber and vanished, racing toward the battlefield.

She knew that this time Xue Lian was in deep trouble!

Outside the loft, Yang Kai's face was cold. He drew a deep breath and abandoned his suppression of the mysterious power within him, letting it erupt.

The dragon's roar shook the heavens; amid blinding golden light, a vast golden form surged from Yang Kai's body—a figure immense enough to obscure the sky, radiating heavy majesty, its two eyes larger than houses and the color of burnished gold, inspiring awe.

It shook its head and tail, and upon appearing it wasted no time in lunging straight at Xue Lian.

Xue Lian froze; the madness that had been like a blazing flame seemed doused by a bucket of cold water and was instantly snuffed out.

In the moment he lost his focus, the golden dragon had already opened its gaping maw and bit down on the Inner Core before him, swallowing it into its belly, then returning to hover above Yang Kai's head and look down.

"Impossible!" Mi Tian cried out, staring dumbfounded at the golden dragon, utterly stunned by the sudden apparition.

"Sacred Dragon!" Yu Xiong almost bit his tongue, his whole body trembling violently.

Ba He looked wordlessly at the astounding scene before him as if his power to speak had been stolen.

Shan Qingluo's lovely eyes gleamed; behind her a spectral image of an eight-legged giant spider, as if cast in silver, suddenly rose to oppose the dragon's might—the colossal spider the size of a house, its phantom nearly solid, a crescent mark on its brow.

"Heavenly Moon Demon Spider!"

Of those present, only she was in a comparatively better position.

First, she was human-born, so the dragon's oppression affected her least; second, she bore the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider's primordial power, giving her some means to resist the dragon's might.

Even so, she was shocked by the golden dragon that had burst forth from Yang Kai.

The entire place fell silent, the bloody fight cut off abruptly; only heavy breathing rose and fell.

Yang Kai glanced up, a strange expression flickering across his face, and coldly looked at Xue Lian: "Sorry, this fellow seems very interested in your Inner Core—I couldn't hold him back!"

Xue Lian's face drained of color; the pride in his eyes collapsed like a ten-thousand-zhang mansion tilted and crumbled into ruins.

In that one confrontation, Yang Kai had scourged him from the inside out—body and spirit left battered and exposed.

Under that terrifying dragon pressure, he could not even summon the thought to reclaim his Inner Core.

"Enough!" a sharp feminine cry suddenly rang out; a beautiful woman appeared from the void, her fierce gaze sweeping the scene before fixing on the golden dragon; she drew a deep breath and her full bosom heaved noticeably.

"Foster Mother!" Shan Qingluo and Yu Xiong cried out at once.

"My Lady!" Ba He gave a respectful salute.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as his Divine Sense swept her; to his shock he could not gauge her depth.

She was a Void King Stage expert!

Her identity was clear—she was the Lady of this palace: Chi Yue!

This was not Yang Kai's first time meeting Void King Stage warriors; he had once spent time with the Ghost Ancestor, but Chi Yue gave him a far more terrifying impression.

After all, the Ghost Ancestor was only a First Stage Void King, whereas Chi Yue had reached the Second Stage.

A one-stage difference in realm was already as great as heaven and earth.

"Junior Yang Kai pays respects to Senior Chi Yue!" Yang Kai cupped his fist and spoke loudly.

Only then did Chi Yue turn her gaze to him and give a slight nod: "You are also a guest in my palace; no need for ceremony."

Yang Kai grinned broadly and said with ease, “This junior has long admired Senior’s great reputation. I should have taken the initiative to pay my respects, but as someone of humble status, I felt unworthy to face you. I ask for Senior’s forgiveness.”

"It matters not. My coming to see you counts the same," Chi Yue replied lightly.

"Foster Mother, about this matter..." Shan Qingluo saw Chi Yue's attitude seemed neither cold nor warm and her heart fluttered; thinking Chi Yue blamed Yang Kai, she hurried to offer a few words in his defense.

"Do not speak; I know it all," Chi Yue interrupted with a wave, not giving her a chance. Phoenix-like eyes narrowed as she looked down at Yang Kai: "The outcome of this battle is decided—shouldn't you return the Inner Core?"

"Return it?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, showing surprise.

"You are not thinking of finishing him off completely, are you?" Chi Yue slowly shook her head. "You are a clever one; you should know what the consequences would be if you truly did that."

"I really do not know—please enlighten me, Senior Chi Yue!" Yang Kai said brazenly, as if not in the least afraid.

Ba He broke out in a cold sweat; Mi Tian felt his soles cramp; Yu Xiong could not help but shiver...

Someone actually dared speak to their Lady like that—does this kid not know how high the heavens are and how vast the earth is?

What good would there be in angering a lord-tier powerful yao? Does he not understand that showing mercy when possible is often the wiser course?

"You little bastard!" Even Chi Yue, whose temperament was well cultivated, was amused by Yang Kai's audacity; after a moment she softened her expression and said kindly, "I'll give you face, you should give me some in return—after all, I'm at such an age that I tire of too many words."

"Senior, old?" Yang Kai exclaimed. "I think you are in your prime—no less splendid than those young maidens of sixteen or seventeen." He looked surprised.

Ba He and the other yao experts were thrown into chaos...

Each of them looked at Yang Kai as if he were a monster.

Was he mocking the lord? That had to be it, right?

In all the world, someone actually dares to mock the lord?

They cautiously glanced at Chi Yue and found, to their astonishment, that she showed no anger; instead a strange smile crossed her face, as if she enjoyed it. She snorted coldly: "Humans are indeed glib; no wonder Qingluo fell so deeply for you—is this how you tricked her into your arms, yes?"

"Senior, you have that wrong; I won her with the charm of my character, not with flattery," Yang Kai replied solemnly, shaking his head.

"Arrogant!" Chi Yue pursed her lips and smiled; after a moment she checked her smile and spoke seriously: "But in any case, you must not be too wanton in my palace. If Xue Lian suffers any mishap, I cannot answer to the Blood Jiao—return the Inner Core to him, and consider it a favor I owe you."

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and cast a sideways glance at the pale-faced Xue Lian, looking somewhat unwilling.

"Do not return it!" Xue Lian suddenly roared, "It was only a remnant image of a Sacred Dragon; it could not bind my Inner Core!"

Saying that, he opened his mouth and inhaled sharply.

The high dragon cry sounded again, and a blood-red light suddenly shot from the golden dragon's body and was swallowed into Xue Lian's belly.

He easily reclaimed his Inner Core!

The golden dragon seethed with rage, baring its teeth and grimacing for a long while.

"Human, I was merely careless just now—you think such a remnant could defeat me? You greatly underestimate me." Xue Lian wore an expression of refusal to be defeated, though the contempt he once showed had vanished, replaced by an air of dread.

Whether he admitted it or not, Yang Kai's strength was by no means inferior to his.
