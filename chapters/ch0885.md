## Chapter 885 — Refinement

Yang Kai had no interest in the set of techniques the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land practiced.

Sacrificing one’s own life force to chase power felt like putting the cart before the horse; the Martial Peak he sought was nothing like that.

So he never intended to live his life following in the footsteps of past Saint Lords.

He had his own goals and pursuits.

Of course this required An Ling'er’s cooperation; when she nodded, Yang Kai felt lighter and a weight lifted from his chest.

"But… what if the elders ask?" An Ling'er worried. "They all seem rather anxious."

"Busybodies meddling where they don’t belong…" Yang Kai muttered without hiding it; he knew the most anxious one had to be that old Xu Hui. He was surely the one pressing An Ling'er to cultivate with him as soon as possible.

Hearing him say that, An Ling'er burst into a small laugh and the room brightened noticeably.

"Do this: if they ask, tell them we’ve already been cultivating."

"That could work… but it’ll only fool them for a while," An Ling'er said, pursing her red lips. "You’ve got no problem—given your aptitude your strength will rise quickly even without that technique—but if I don’t break through my current realm for a long time the elders will surely become suspicious…"

"I’ll help you!" Yang Kai grinned.

"How will you help me?" An Ling'er blinked in surprise.

Yang Kai flipped his hand and produced a delicate jade vial, handing it over. "There’s some very special spirit liquid in here. Take a drop each day and your strength will gradually increase."

An Ling'er accepted it half skeptical. She opened the stopper and inhaled a pure fragrance; it refreshed her spirit and her eyes brightened as she looked at Yang Kai. "This will really work?"

"Of course," Yang Kai said confidently. "When it’s used up, ask me for more."

"I’ll take it home and try it—thank you." An Ling'er giggled; after chatting with Yang Kai a while she brightened, her earlier sadness gone.

After talking for a while longer, An Ling'er left.

Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense to inform Xu Hui, Li Rong and the others that he would be entering seclusion for a period and not to disturb him unless necessary.

After receiving their replies, Yang Kai left the Saint Lord’s compound and made his way alone to the Sacred Tomb.

The Sacred Tomb was an ideal place for seclusion—unless Yang Kai used the Saint Lord’s spirit ring to open it, no one else could, so there was no worry of being disturbed.

Before the massive bluestone, Yang Kai pressed the Saint Lord’s spirit ring into the designated spot, opened the tomb, and slipped inside.

The dim, eerie chamber still bore signs of disciples’ lives in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; though the environment was shabby, the Spiritual Qi here was exceptionally dense.

He picked a spot at random and sat cross-legged.

Taking out the long-shuttle secret treasure he’d obtained from the starry sky, Yang Kai examined it carefully.

He could sense a wondrous power hidden within; countless intricate spirit formation diagrams were carved inside, but without refining it he had no way of knowing the treasure’s true function.

He stilled his breath and spread out his Divine Sense, probing the long-shuttle treasure to reveal its material and structure, searching for a point of entry.

The first step in refining a secret treasure was to leave one’s soul imprint within it—engrave one’s life-mark—only then could the refining begin.

After leaving the imprint, one draws it into the body and nourishes it with True Yuan and Divine Sense.

When it reached a certain degree it would resonate with the owner and become theirs to use.

Even after taking it into the body, long nurturing was necessary before the treasure’s full power could be realized.

That was why warriors rarely swapped their treasures—long refinement and nurturing forged a subtle link that allowed the treasure to display its full might in battle and greatly enhance combat power.

Swapping in an unfamiliar treasure wouldn’t produce that effect.

Only when a warrior’s strength had outgrown a treasure’s grade would they choose to replace it.

Even then, they sought treasures compatible with their own techniques and martial skills to refine.

More often, warriors hunted materials and commissioned master craftsmen to make bespoke treasures.

Only an outstanding craftsman could tailor a treasure that truly suited a warrior.

Yang Kai had never been so particular; he seldom relied on a treasure’s might—if one worked he’d refine it, but he was too lazy to hunt materials or beg craftsmen.

This long-shuttle treasure had once belonged to someone else; that owner likely got lost in the starry sky or met some accident and fell, and the treasure drifted with meteoric debris until Yang Kai discovered it.

His Divine Sense passed through it and soon Yang Kai detected a faint soul aura within the long-shuttle treasure.

It was the original owner’s soul imprint.

He had to erase it before carving his own mark.

Feeling that aura, Yang Kai couldn’t help but be shocked.

Although many years had passed and the aura within the treasure had weakened, he could still perceive how pure and dense it had once been.

The treasure’s original owner had been at least a Third Stage of the Saint Realm expert.

Such a top-tier master perishing in the starry sky invited regret.

Yang Kai realized anew how terrifying the starry sky was; his two prior ventures there were but a drop in the ocean—he might not have seen the true danger.

It was a calamity that could fell even those at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

He shifted his Divine Sense and the Divine Sense Fire flared, burning fiercely inside the treasure.

Sizzle…

The soul imprint within the treasure was erased in an instant, gone without a trace.

Yang Kai’s True Yuan surged, continuously poured into the long-shuttle, and his Divine Sense lingered inside.

This work consumed time and could not be rushed, so Yang Kai sat calmly, sustaining the flow of True Yuan and Divine Sense to let the shuttle become familiar with his aura.

Gradually, subtle currents of True Yuan and Divine Sense seeped into the shuttle and took hold—signs that it had begun to accept his presence.

Yang Kai relaxed, knowing the treasure and his True Yuan were not at odds; if they were, no amount of effort would enable refinement.

He left the long-shuttle to be permeated by his True Yuan and Divine Sense and withdrew his mind into the Black Book Space.

The Divine Tree sensed his arrival and gave a faint welcome; its mood seemed a little down.

"What’s wrong?" Yang Kai asked with a wry smile, sending a message.

"I feel a little lonely," the Divine Tree replied. "There’s only me here; when you’re not around I can only stare into space."

"Lonely…" Yang Kai’s face darkened as he suddenly realized the Divine Tree’s sentience had grown beyond his expectations.

It wouldn’t have said such things before.

"Sorry," Yang Kai offered. "I can’t place living creatures here, otherwise I’d find you some companions… Well, there used to be a Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, but it’s gone now."

"Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng? What’s that?"

"A kind of Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object!" Yang Kai explained, his eyes brightening. "Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects possess some consciousness; I can try to find a few to keep you company."

The Divine Tree rejoiced and urged, "What are you waiting for? Go find some."

"Not right now," Yang Kai chuckled. "I’m in seclusion. I promise I’ll look for them when I emerge. Besides, such things are extremely rare and will take time to find."

"Oh." The Divine Tree sounded slightly disappointed but quickly recovered, cheerfully saying, "Then I’ll wait."

Yang Kai nodded earnestly. "Don’t worry, I’ll find them for you."

"I believe you!"

"Have those two stones changed at all?" Yang Kai asked.

"Still the same; they’ve kept devouring the other stones, and I’ve noticed their appetite seems to have grown quite a bit!"

"Oh?" Yang Kai hurried over to the two jet-black spheres and found, just as the Divine Tree had said, that after Li Rong and he had gathered a large amount of ore in the starry sky and placed it there, the spheres had intensified their absorption of mineral essence.

In only a few days they had consumed what would normally take a month.

The area was littered with ground, depleted rock fragments.

Looking out, Yang Kai could clearly see veins of essence converging, streaming from those ores into the jet-black spheres and disappearing.

Nourished by the mineral essence, the two spheres emitted a faint glow; the vein-like patterns within them grew clearer and more connected, and a great flow of energy coursed through.

"What exactly are these? Why do they eat stone?" the Divine Tree asked with curiosity.

"I don’t know either," Yang Kai shrugged. "But the truth will come to light in time. Keep watching them, and tell me if you notice any big change."

"Mm."

After a short while, Yang Kai left the Black Book Space and his mind returned to his body.

Time passed swiftly—half a month went by.

In those fifteen days Yang Kai never stopped letting his True Yuan and Divine Sense erode the long-shuttle treasure, carving his life-mark and soul imprint; the progress was slow.

The grade of this long-shuttle treasure was uncertain; it proved even harder to refine than a Saint-Grade Upper-Level Silver Leaf treasure.

Yet after half a month Yang Kai finally succeeded in stamping his mark inside and, with a thought, brought it into his body.

What followed was a long period of nurturing.

Only when he could resonate with the long-shuttle treasure would he discern its uses and be able to wield it in battle.

This required no special exertion from Yang Kai—only the passage of time; once a certain depth was reached resonance would naturally occur.
