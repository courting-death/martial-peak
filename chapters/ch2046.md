## Chapter 2046 — Breaking the Seal

In the crowd, the gaunt man whom Zong Qing had fixed his gaze upon flinched slightly, his face turning somewhat unpleasant.

Yet he was alone; seeing his movements exposed, he stopped dodging and hiding and instead cupped his hands and said, "Deputy Hall Master Zong, forgive me— I misspoke just now. Since both Hall Masters give this assurance, of course I trust you both."

Now the situation was like an arm unable to twist a thigh. Zong Qing had already put the matter on record; no one could force him to swear an oath, and the only choice for those wanting to enter the cave was to believe Zong Qing's words.

So the gaunt man sized up the situation and hurriedly swallowed his pride to make peace.

Hearing this, Zong Qing smiled in satisfaction and scanned the surroundings: "If any friends still have doubts, feel free to raise them; I can answer each of you one by one."

The entire venue was silent.

Zong Qing nodded in satisfaction. "Good. It seems you are all prepared. In that case, there's no time to lose—we'll begin preparations at once. But a straight word beforehand: when we dismantle the sealing formation later, if anyone dares to shirk their work and fish in troubled waters, don't blame me for being merciless."

The crowd repeatedly declared they wouldn't dare.

At that moment, Lian Yuming, who had been standing beside Zong Qing, said, "Now let me explain the nature of this sealing formation; later you can just cooperate with the effort. Listen carefully. This ancestral cave was definitely left behind by an Emperor Realm expert. The formation outside the cave is divided into three layers. The first and second layers are not difficult to break; my Blazing Fire Hall disciples have already become quite adept at handling them. The troublesome one is the third layer. To unravel it, sufficient power is required—if the force isn’t enough, it simply cannot be broken. And once the third layer fails to be breached, the first two layers that were broken earlier will rapidly repair themselves. Our Blazing Fire Hall has been stuck precisely at this third layer. In a moment, my disciples will attempt to break the first two layers again. As for all of you, you will join Brother Zong and me in breaking the third layer. I trust none of you have any objections?”

"Naturally no objections. But Deputy Hall Master Lian, is there any particular trick to the method of breaking it? Do we merely strike the formation with force?" someone below asked; it was the question on everyone's mind.

Lian Yuming nodded upon hearing this. "Power is required, yes, but brute force alone won't do; you must rely on the might of a Secret Treasure. I happen to have a Secret Treasure on hand that can be used here."

As he spoke, he flicked his wrist and a dagger about two fingers long appeared in his palm; the dagger was jet‑black and an unusual radiance flowed along its blade—clearly a fine object.

"A Dao Origin‑Grade Secret Treasure?" someone exclaimed, showing envy.

Almost all the martial artists present were in the Origin Returning Realm or Void King Realm; none possessed Dao Origin‑Grade Secret Treasures, so they were naturally astonished at the sight of the dagger.

"Indeed, this dagger of mine is no ordinary Dao Origin‑Grade Secret Treasure; it's a Dao Origin‑Grade Middle‑Level Secret Treasure. It has another property: the greater the power poured into it, the greater the damage it can unleash. Even with my full effort I cannot bring out its full effect. Shortly, after Brother Zong and I have acted, you will pour your own power into this dagger and leave the rest to me," Lian Yuming said with a look of pride, clearly pleased with his dagger.

"So Deputy Hall Master Lian has such a strange Secret Treasure—this breaking of the formation should be fine then," some below perked up.

"Whether it will work depends on whether you can contribute enough power," Lian Yuming said, sheathing the dagger and then barking, "If no one has other questions, rest for a quarter of an hour. Then we'll begin!"

After finishing, he was the first to close his eyes and cultivate.

Seeing this, the others hurriedly sat cross‑legged to recover, striving to bring their states to their peak.

Zong Qing, however, did not idle; he walked up to the many disciples of the Blazing Fire Hall and carefully spoke to them. Their conversation was not kept secret, so the others could still hear it clearly.

Seeing that Zong Qing was only instructing the Blazing Fire Hall disciples about timing for breaking the formation, everyone relaxed.

"Brother Yang, be careful later. I have a feeling something is off; the people of the Blazing Fire Hall shouldn't be this conciliatory," Kang Siran's voice suddenly reached Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded without expression.

None of the martial artists present were fools; many naturally harbored such doubts and misgivings, but with great profit at stake no one dared risk offending the Blazing Fire Hall by bringing the matter up openly. They could only stay quietly on guard and act when the opportunity presented itself.

A quarter hour later, Lian Yuming and Zong Qing gathered together again; the former suddenly barked, "Time's up—follow me."

With that, he immediately rose into the air.

The others hurried after them.

Before long, everyone arrived at a ledge halfway up Primordial Cauldron Mountain: a protruding stone platform large enough to hold dozens of people, with a bare stone wall in front of it.

Upon arriving, Lian Yuming and Zong Qing had everyone halt, then flew to the stone wall to inspect it carefully.

"Is that the entrance?" Yang Kai asked Kang Siran softly.

Kang Siran subtly nodded without speaking.

A moment later, the two Deputy Hall Masters of the Blazing Fire Hall flew back and stood before the crowd. Zong Qing said, "Everyone, Brother Lian and I have just gone to check; we confirm the formation has indeed restored itself. Proceed according to our earlier plan. If we can break it in one fell swoop, we can enter the cave of an Emperor Realm expert and see what lies within. Emperor Realm‑level techniques, pills, Secret Treasures—perhaps all are inside. We shall not come away empty‑handed."

At those words many showed greedy expressions, their blood boiling.

Zong Qing's face suddenly turned grave; he barked, "Blazing Fire Hall disciples, strike!"

At his command, the dozen or so elite disciples of the Blazing Fire Hall split into two groups, each forming an odd formation centered on the strongest martial artist in each group, their hands continuously performing abstruse formations.

Among those people Yang Kai saw Zong Zijin, who was the center of one group.

With the Blazing Fire Hall members circulating their power, an astonishing scene unfolded.

Their powers seemed to link together, indistinguishable from one another, and the two center disciples' auras rose from the Third Stage of the Void King Realm up to the level of the Dao Origin Realm.

This was clearly a special secret art of the Blazing Fire Hall, allowing practitioners to string their power together and achieve a temporary elevation.

After a moment, the leader of one group let out a muffled roar; a sharp sword appeared in his hand as he poured his power into it. The sword quivered in the void and then shot forward, stabbing into nothingness.

Ahead of it, a dazzling formation light suddenly flared and stopped the sword.

Yet under the martial artist's desperate exertion, the formation was quickly cut open.

At that instant the second group's disciples, led by Zong Zijin, also unleashed their secret art. With the support of others' power, Zong Zijin's palm flashed; he used some Secret Treasure and hurled it forward, releasing a burst of light.

The light passed through the first broken formation and soon struck the second layer of the formation.

From the force on the formation, the second layer was far thicker than the first, yet still could not withstand the methods of the Blazing Fire Hall disciples.

Before long, a gap had been cut through the second layer.

Just then Lian Yuming, who had been waiting, roared, "Strike!"

At his command he directly manifested the dagger Secret Treasure, his spiritual formations fluttering like butterflies.

Standing beside him, Zong Qing unhesitatingly poured his own power into the dagger.

In the next moment, dozens of outside martial artists also began performing methods, pouring their own power into the dagger.

The dagger buzzed; as countless streams of power were funneled into it, its size unexpectedly changed, and in the blink of an eye it became a colossal object about two zhang long, its surface gleaming with a riot of colors.

Lian Yuming's arms trembled violently; a look of strain marred his face, as if controlling such enormous power put tremendous pressure on him.

He lasted less than ten breaths before he had to shout, "Go!"

At his command the two‑zhang dagger shot forward with a whistling sound, passing through the first and second layers and cleaving in the void.

Boom.

The dagger shook slightly; Lian Yuming's body trembled, and the other martial artists who had poured power into it felt a backlash of force, many of their faces changing color.

In front of the dagger, a thicker layer of formation light flashed up, opposing the dagger and preventing it from advancing an inch.

Seeing this, Lian Yuming's expression turned unpleasant; he changed several formations in quick succession but still could not break the Third Stage formation.

The situation suddenly stalemated.

To make matters worse, Zong Zijin suddenly shouted at that moment, "Father, the second layer is beginning to restore!"

As he spoke, white light shimmered at the gap he had cut in the second layer, and the breach indeed repaired itself at tremendous speed, forcing him and the other Blazing Fire Hall disciples to desperately maintain their exertion to keep the situation from worsening.

Seeing this, Zong Qing's face darkened and he barked, "Everyone, victory or defeat rests on this attempt. If we cannot break the Third Stage formation, we will never enter this ancestral cave. Are you all still holding back? Do you not want to see what treasures lie within?"
