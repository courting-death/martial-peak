## Chapter 1637 — Hearts in Accord

So long as Yang Kai didn’t interfere, with Yu Xueqing’s abilities alone, she wouldn’t be able to stop him—he could have withdrawn with ease.

Thus his life and death hung on a single thought of Yang Kai's.

Yu Xueqing frowned and cried out hurriedly, "Young Brother, do not be afraid. The Fire Radiance Sect is powerful, yet Ice Heart Valley is no pushover—we will protect you. Please assist me in killing this scoundrel."

She feared Yang Kai might be cowed by the other man's words and shrink back at the crucial moment.

After all, Yan Chilei was different from Jiang Xi; though Jiang Xi was strong, he was ultimately alone—if he died no one would avenge him, whereas Yan Chilei was an elder of the Fire Radiance Sect, backed by great power.

"Of course I'll kill him!" Yang Kai grinned viciously and looked at Yan Chilei with derision, "Threatening me at this point—are all of your Fire Radiance Sect people so foolish?"

Yan Chilei's face went pale.

“Oh, right—I forgot to mention, this isn’t the first time I’ve killed someone from the Fire Radiance Sect. Back in the Imperial Garden, I killed a man named Kong Wendong, and not long ago in the Blood Prison, another one called Zhang Qing. They were both from your Fire Radiance Sect, weren’t they?”

Yan Chilei was truly thrown into panic.

He had not expected Yang Kai's grudge with the Fire Radiance Sect to run so deep; Kong Wendong and Zhang Qing were famous within the sect, elder-level figures who even ranked above him.

Yet Kong Wendong went into the Imperial Garden and never returned; Zhang Qing entered the Blood Prison and likewise disappeared without a trace.

If Yang Kai's words were true, did that mean they had all been killed by this brat?

“I’ve never had any fondness for your Fire Radiance Sect, so… die!” Yang Kai’s expression turned cold in an instant. A surge of soul power, pure to the extreme, condensed into a single straight beam and blasted toward Yan Chilei.

Soundless yet vast as the sea, the power was like an unstoppable blade, tearing through Yan Chilei's defenses and stabbing into his Sea of Consciousness.

Yan Chilei screamed, his face ashen; his spirit had been grievously wounded.

Yu Xueqing's beautiful eyes brightened; seizing the opportunity she drove her own field of Shi and profound intent, centering on her body to make the area within thirty zhang unbearably cold, as if even the air had frozen.

A thin layer of frost appeared on Yan Chilei's skin. The chill invaded his body, disrupting his Saint Yuan and sapping his agility.

The Fire Bird pounced, opened its gaping maw and swallowed Yan Chilei whole.

To the naked eye, a swelling could be seen within the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit’s abdomen—but that blazing heat instantly refined and dissolved it into nothingness.

As time passed, that bulge diminished and finally vanished.

A burst of lightning suddenly flared within the Fire Bird’s body. In the next instant, the Fire Bird turned into a streak of fire and flew back into Yang Kai’s body, leaving only a pile of remains behind.

This fellow had evidently also practiced the Qiantian Thunderfire secret art, like Zhang Qing and Kong Wendong. After death the Qiantian Thunderfire was devoured by the Fire Bird, augmenting its power.

A calamity had been strangely averted.

Yu Xueqing stood gasping, her gaze complex as she looked at Yang Kai.

The other women of Ice Heart Valley were likewise shocked.

Only Qing Ya smiled radiantly.

After a long while Yu Xueqing reluctantly accepted reality and nodded at Yang Kai, "Thank you."

Had Yang Kai not suddenly shone so brightly, only two or three of this party might have escaped; but now not only were they unscathed, even those from the Fire Radiance Sect had been wiped out.

Yu Xueqing was grateful to Yang Kai from the bottom of her heart.

"No need. I only acted to preserve myself. Can we be on our way now?" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Yu Xueqing nodded, sent a disciple to gather the spoils, and then led everyone on toward Icebound Island.

But this time no one treated Yang Kai as an enemy.

They all reined in their previous, inexplicable hostility and no longer surrounded him as before to protect him. The clash with the Fire Radiance Sect had revealed that Yang Kai was the strongest among them.

There was no need for them to guard him!

On the road ahead they kept glancing at Yang Kai with curiosity, baffled how a youth of only the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could display such exaggerated combat prowess.

“Thirteenth Elder, why were we seeking him?” Qing Ya, observing the mood, knew this was the best moment to ask and immediately spoke up.

The other Ice Heart Valley disciples also looked at Yu Xueqing in confusion.

These women had been campaigning for a year, each searching for Yang Kai; many Senior Sisters had died before their eyes, and naturally they were curious why all this had happened.

Yu Xueqing frowned, appearing troubled, and said, "I don't know the exact reason. The Fire Radiance Sect was searching, so Ice Heart Valley could not let them succeed. Perhaps… he knows something himself."

As she spoke she looked at Yang Kai thoughtfully.

Yang Kai's expression was indifferent, as if his spirit wandered beyond the mundane; he showed no intent to answer.

"This matter need not be your concern. If the Sect Master and the Elders take action, there must be a reason."

"Yes!" they replied.

The journey was uneventful as Yu Xueqing led the party on for half a month.

Only after half a month did they arrive at a city beside the great sea.

It was clearly under Ice Heart Valley's influence. Yu Xueqing took Yang Kai directly to the city's Space Array and used it to teleport to Icebound Island.

On the outer island, the moment Yang Kai appeared, his expression changed—an uncontrollable excitement flickered across his face. He turned his head and fixed his gaze in a certain direction, as though his eyes could pierce through the barriers of space to behold a distant place.

At the same time, in an ice chamber on the inner island Su Yan, who was meditating, abruptly opened her lovely eyes and trembled slightly.

At that moment she felt something.

She sensed Yang Kai's aura!

The two had practiced the Dual Cultivation Technique; as long as they were not too distant they could sense one another.

Although the outer and inner islands were separated by hundreds of li, that could not erase the spiritual link between Yang Kai and Su Yan!

She is here!

He has come!

At the same instant they perceived each other's presence.

Yang Kai stood where he was, his gaze gentle as water, capable of softening even stone.

Su Yan hurriedly rose and went out!

But she had only just stepped out of the ice chamber when two women blocked her way.

"Junior Sister Su, where are you going?" The woman named Zhou among the two who guarded Su Yan looked at her with a face like frost and stood before her.

"Senior Sister Zhou, I must go out for a moment!" Su Yan pleaded.

"Impossible!" Senior Sister Zhou decisively shook her head. "The Great Elder ordered you must remain here during this period; do not step out an inch. Do not make things hard for your Senior Sisters."

“That’s right, Junior Sister Su. The two of us have been guarding you here—boring and thankless work as it is. You may be a disciple under the Great Elder, but that doesn’t mean you can ignore your Senior Sisters, does it? We’d advise you to go back.” The other woman also looked coldly at Su Yan.

Guarding Su Yan was a tedious, torturous duty—no wandering, no focused cultivation—and both women resented it greatly.

They already disliked Su Yan's favored status and so spoke without courtesy.

"Two Senior Sisters, I do not wish to make things hard for you. I must go out briefly; I promise I will return within half a day!" Su Yan bit her red lips and looked at them helplessly.

“So Junior Sister truly has no regard for her Senior Sisters, hmm?” The woman surnamed Zhou sneered repeatedly. “Have you thought about what kind of punishment we’ll face if the Great Elder learns you slipped out? I don’t know what you’re planning to do, but I will not bear the blame for your foolish behavior.”

"You are the Great Elder's favored disciple. The Great Elder may not punish you harshly, but what about us? You know how strict the Great Elder is. You're beautiful but should not be venomous—do you intend to get us killed?"

Su Yan opened her mouth and had no reply.

Although their words were exaggerated and extreme, it was undeniable that if she truly left they would be implicated.

Her expression instantly fell and she whispered, "Junior Sister was thoughtless."

Her man was already on Icebound Island, so close she could almost reach him, yet she could not go to meet him; Su Yan's heart ached.

"Good. Now go back!" Senior Sister Zhou snorted.

Su Yan nodded reluctantly and turned to return.

After she closed the ice chamber door and resumed seclusion, the two guardians sneered.

The woman surnamed Zhou said, “Finally, that’s a breath of relief. Did she really think that just because she became the Great Elder’s disciple, she could treat everyone else as beneath her eyes?”

The other woman giggled and said, "She used to be arrogant. Had she kept good relations with us, this wouldn't be so hard on her now."

"As Senior Sisters we should teach her how to behave."

"Should we report this to the Great Elder?"

Zhou hesitated, then shook her head. "Not yet. Since she failed to get out, reporting it won't lead to punishment. Better to wait until she truly errs, then report—then the Great Elder won't tolerate her."

"Senior Sister is right." The other woman's eyes brightened.

……

"Young Brother!" Yu Xueqing's call brought Yang Kai back; he finally withdrew his gaze and looked toward her.

The Thirteenth Elder of Ice Heart Valley's expression was odd; she cleared her throat and said, "That is the inner island of Icebound Island. As a man you are absolutely forbidden to set foot within it; we are currently on the outer island. Were it not for these exceptional circumstances you would not be allowed in."

"Being permitted into Icebound Island is already an honor for this junior; thanks, Elder!" Yang Kai cupped his hands in thanks.

Because of Su Yan, Yang Kai was in good spirits and noticed how radiant the Ice Heart Valley women were, their attitudes warm yet natural. Though Yu Xueqing did not probe into the slight changes in Yang Kai, she nodded and said, "Stay here for now; as for later… when I report back to the Sect Master and the Elders we'll decide."
