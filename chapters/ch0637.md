## Chapter 637 — Saint-Grade Expert?

Outside Blazing Fire City, the Coffin-Bearer strolled forward, followed by dozens of powerful figures.

All the martial artists in Blazing Fire City watched and waited.

Yang Kai listened to Yun Xuan’s recounting about the Coffin-Bearer, his face full of puzzlement. “Why would he do such a thing?”

“Probably compensation!” Ji Yan interjected with a sullen expression.

“Compensation? Compensation for what?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

“Compensation for the wounds he leaves where he stays!” Ji Yan drew in a deep breath, worry and dread surfacing on his face. “Whenever the Coffin-Bearer halts in a place, that place suffers living beings’ annihilation; nothing sprouts, and within a hundred-li radius no life will appear for ten years.”

Yang Kai could not help but be shocked.

Ji Yan rubbed his forehead. “I hope he’s only passing through and doesn’t linger here in Blazing Fire City.”

If the Coffin-Bearer lingered in Blazing Fire City, that hundred-li area would surely be annihilated.

Only then did Yang Kai understand why the other martial artists wore excited, expectant looks while Ji Yan alone was filled with anxiety — as the city lord of Blazing Fire City, he naturally would not want the city he guarded destroyed so casually.

As they spoke, a cry suddenly rose from over there: “He’s stopped, he’s stopped!”

Ji Yan’s whole body trembled like a tiger, his face going ashen.

His fears had come to pass: this Coffin-Bearer had come from some unknown distant place, his destination unknown, yet he had chosen to rest near Blazing Fire City.

Around Ji Yan, the disciples of the Duao Alliance also all displayed grave expressions.

“Uncle Ji…” Yun Xuan called softly.

Ji Yan’s eyes stayed fixed on the Coffin-Bearer; he did not reply, his expression strained and hesitant. After a long moment he barked, “Return to the city and issue evacuation orders to every resident! Take your valuables and leave at once!”

“City Lord…”

“If you delay it will be too late. Go now; I will stall them!” Saying so, Ji Yan leapt forward toward the dozens who trailed the Coffin-Bearer.

Yun Xuan’s face was bitter and helpless; since the Coffin-Bearer had stopped, it meant that in the near future Blazing Fire City would become a dead zone, a terrible loss for the Duao Alliance.

Yang Kai kept watching the strange man bearing a blood-red coffin; through his Divine Sense he clearly sensed waves of death and corpse-essence radiating from him, and judging by the countless tumors and pustules covering his body, he should long since have been bereft of life.

In other words, he should have been a corpse already.

Yet the enormous power contained within him made everyone tremble with fear.

As Ji Yan hurried toward the dozens, the Coffin-Bearer’s awful, bell-like eyes swept downward. Apparently satisfied with this spot, he simply dropped straight down.

Boom...

The ground shuddered violently; spiderweb cracks spread across the earth. The Coffin-Bearer planted himself on the ground and stood motionless, eyes closing as if to rest.

Many martial artists grew restless, greed showing on their faces; power coalesced about them, but in the presence of those dozens who followed the Coffin-Bearer — given their stature and rank — they dared not act rashly.

Ji Yan had already joined with those dozens; they seemed acquainted, exchanged greetings, and conferred in low voices.

“Who are those people?” Yang Kai asked.

“They’re experts from nearby sects: Xu Qi of the Leiguang Divine Sect, Transcendent Realm, Second Stage; Zou Xing of the Xuantian Alliance of Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm; Yao Di of the War Soul Hall, also Transcendent Realm, Third Stage……” Yun Xuan indicated them with her eyes and quietly recited the names of the stronger figures and their histories.

“I don’t recognize the others either, but they’re surely not nobodies.” Yun Xuan inhaled lightly. “They must have heard rumors of the Coffin-Bearer’s appearance and followed him all the way here.”

“Are those people interested in the Coffin-Bearer’s compensation?” Yang Kai was startled. Several among them were Transcendent Realm, Third Stage — elite figures; he thought they would not care about such meager gains.

“They aren’t interested in the Coffin-Bearer’s compensation itself, but the Coffin-Bearer is an enormous mystery. Everyone wants to uncover his origins and secrets; what they’re targeting is the Coffin-Bearer himself.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, the matter becoming clearer.

Ji Yan still negotiated with them with a respectful air. Though he was the city lord under the Duao Alliance, his cultivation at Transcendent Realm, First Stage made him somewhat deferential before these experts.

After a long discussion, Zou Xing of the Xuantian Alliance nodded. “Very well, then we shall wait for an hour. City Lord Ji, please hurry.”

Yao Di of the War Soul Hall laughed oddly. “Heaven has pity; we naturally will not overdo it. City Lord Ji, go on.”

“Thank you, everyone!” Ji Yan expressed his gratitude and hastened back into the city to arrange the evacuation.

Many martial artists lingered in Blazing Fire City; most were weak and could not escape quickly if something happened.

After explaining the stakes, those willing to leave went at once; those unwilling would not be compelled — though he was city lord, Ji Yan could not command those not under the Duao Alliance.

An hour passed swiftly.

Around the Coffin-Bearer, the nearby sky and land were ringed in three layers inward and three layers outward; each person who remained stared at the Coffin-Bearer with burning eyes, as if he were a steaming prize.

Ji Yan returned filled with worry. He glanced at the surrounding situation and sighed helplessly, shaking his head.

He had done all he could; those who remained would not be persuaded to go, and Ji Yan had no other way.

“Miss Yun, do not stray too far from me. Though the Coffin-Bearer will not strike people, wherever he appears great danger follows.” Ji Yan warned in a grave voice; Yun Xuan nodded solemnly.

From the dozens of strong figures, Zou Xing suddenly stepped forward, staring at the Coffin-Bearer. In a clear voice he said, “You all have likely heard the legends of the Coffin-Bearer. Heh heh — fate places this chance before you; do not miss it. Those who seek benefit may act now; we shall provide cover for you!”

Zou Xing of the Xuantian Alliance incited the others to make a move; his intent was plainly ill. Most present understood his meaning, yet remembering the legends some could not hold back and casually launched their Martial Skills and Secret Treasures.

A dozen gleams of light carried considerable force and struck the Coffin-Bearer, who was supposedly meditating with his eyes closed; these attacks were at least full-power strikes from Divine Roaming Realm experts, but they were like stones thrown into the sea — they vanished without a ripple upon hitting the Coffin-Bearer.

The Coffin-Bearer gave no response; with pure flesh-and-blood he endured those blows without reaction, remaining in apparent meditation.

The dozen who had struck retreated a few paces and watched for a long while. Seeing no response, they rejoiced, convinced the legends were true: no matter how others attacked, the Coffin-Bearer would not counterattack.

Soon, more assaults were unleashed, flooding toward the Coffin-Bearer whose frame was abnormally burly.

Boom after boom...

The earth roared; trenches were torn open. The ground around the Coffin-Bearer shattered in an instant as chaotic energy wreaked unimaginable destruction at his side.

Still, the Coffin-Bearer remained motionless.

Every onlookers had now struck, unleashing their full fury.

At last the Coffin-Bearer slowly opened his eyes; breath visible to the naked eye burst from his nostrils as he exhaled heavily, his panting causing the very air of heaven and earth to pause.

Each attacker involuntarily slackened, hearts trembling, fearing a counterattack. What calmed them was that even after such an onslaught the Coffin-Bearer still did not retaliate; he merely stood there, his eyes bewildered as if he could not comprehend what lay before him.

Yang Kai was aghast; only now did he truly grasp the terror of the Coffin-Bearer.

“Is this a Saint-Grade expert?” Yang Kai turned to Yun Xuan.

“Yes.” Yun Xuan nodded.

Yang Kai’s eyelids tightened.

A Saint-Grade expert reduced to such a state — one could not help but wonder what tragedies befell him in life; truly, affairs of the world are unpredictable.

“Why haven’t those men acted yet?” Ruan Xinyu looked at the Leiguang sect and Xuantian Alliance contingent and asked softly.

“They’re waiting.” Ji Yan sighed. “A Saint-Grade expert’s defenses require tremendous force to breach, even for them. With so many free helpers, they’re happy to take it easy — but they should be about to strike.”

At that moment, the dozens who had trailed the Coffin-Bearer finally made their move.

Yao Di of the War Soul Hall watched for a while and then said, “That should be enough. We should contribute our strength, otherwise as more people arrive the matter will be harder to handle.”

“Agreed.” Xu Qi gave a slight nod. “The sooner we finish the sooner we can report back; I’ve been following him for a month, and these old bones are tired.”

“Then strike!” Zou Xing also nodded in agreement.

With the three men in accord, the others no longer hesitated and began manifesting their Secret Treasures.

Surging, vast auras spread out; Martial Skills and Secret Treasures fell like stars upon the Coffin-Bearer, far more ferocious than the previous rabble’s attacks.

Rumble upon rumble...

The earth cracked; for a hundred-li radius the ground trembled and mountains shook.

Such an onslaught finally elicited a response from the Coffin-Bearer: many wounds split open over his body, the tumors and pustules burst, and an exceedingly dense emerald-green gas flowed forth from within him.

The instant this gas appeared, everyone felt the scent of death assail them.

Ssssss...

Where the emerald gas passed, the earth was stripped of all vitality and instantly stained green — a terrifying sight.

The gas spread at great speed, erupting outward like an explosion.

Some who stood too close had no time to evade; they were swallowed by the gas and without making a sound their bodies dissolved into blood and water, their bones gone.
