## Chapter 1412 — Imperial Garden Anomaly

All the great powers had disciples stationed near Tianyun City, waiting for the very moment the Imperial Garden opened!

No one could explain the scene before them, but it very well might mean the Imperial Garden had opened.

At that thought, everyone’s emotions flared; bodies trembled as they fixed their attention more closely on the Imperial Garden's movements.

Excited though they were, no one dared step forward to take a peek; the Spiritual Qi fluctuations emanating from where the Imperial Garden had originally been were terrifying, and the sight itself was harrowing—who would recklessly risk their life to investigate? Likely they would be shredded into powder by that raging heavenly Spiritual Qi before they could get close.

Even the woman surnamed Ye did not dare move, merely standing in place with an unsettled expression.

Yang Kai and Chang Qi and the others wore equally intense expressions. The four of them stood within the Protective Mountain Array of Dragon Lair Mountain, looking up with faces changing constantly.

Suddenly a fragrant breeze wafted by and another person appeared beside them. Yang Kai turned his head and found Yang Yan had somehow slipped out from within; she was now standing at his side, also gazing up at the sky.

"It isn’t the Imperial Garden opening!" Yang Yan murmured calmly; unfortunately only Yang Kai heard her—Chang Qi and the others had their minds snared by the celestial anomaly and did not notice what she said.

“Then what is this?” Yang Kai asked hastily, his concern making him lose composure. He had momentarily forgotten that Yang Yan was a Soul Incarnation of the Starry Sky Emperor—she should, at least to some extent, know about the situation regarding the Imperial Garden.

Since Yang Yan said this was not the sign of the Imperial Garden opening, she must have her reasons.

"Not sure. But it definitely isn’t the Imperial Garden opening… though it seems related to entering the Imperial Garden." Yang Yan frowned, evidently puzzled as well—she was not the emperor’s true body, after all, and many memories were incomplete, so her uncertainty was understandable.

Yang Kai frowned but did not press further.

When the woman surnamed Ye noticed Yang Yan’s presence, her face brightened. She moved and suddenly came to the front of the Protective Mountain Array, respectfully and excitedly gazing at Yang Yan. Just as she was about to speak, Yang Yan stopped her: "We can speak later; come in first!"

Saying so, she waved and released a Saint Yuan. It flowed into the array’s luminous screen before them. The screen immediately split open a gap—large enough for a single person to pass through.

The woman surnamed Ye blushed slightly, looking flattered, and replied respectfully, "Yes!"

She then slipped into the Protective Mountain Array; the buck‑toothed warrior Ge Qi naturally followed closely behind, meek and obsequious, occasionally glancing at Yang Yan before quickly averting his eyes as if afraid his gaze would profane her.

Chang Qi, Hao An and Ning Xiangchen finally shifted their attention. Their mouths all hung open as they stared at the woman surnamed Ye in stunned, mechanical amazement.

The three had been standing beside Yang Yan and had clearly heard how the woman had answered.

They could not believe their ears; they exchanged bewildered looks and felt their nerves fray.

Was this a joke? A person of such transcendent means and lofty status, when facing Yang Yan, actually behaved like a subordinate obeying orders—what on earth was going on?

Yang Kai was also surprised, but less so than Chang Qi and the others; he already knew something of Yang Yan’s identity and privately guessed the woman surnamed Ye must have some connection to the Starry Sky Emperor’s true body, otherwise she wouldn’t behave so.

Though puzzled, this was not the time to investigate. Yang Kai suppressed his doubts and resolved to ask about it when he had the chance.

Casting a glance at the buck‑toothed warrior, Yang Kai chuckled and clasped his fists in salute, "Brother Ge, we meet again."

"Ahem…" Ge Qi looked awkward, turning his body slightly as he returned the salute, saying, "Call me Xiao Qi, just Xiao Qi."

Although he had yet to figure out the relationship between Yang Kai and Yang Yan, he didn’t dare show the slightest arrogance at this moment. After all, even his own Grandmaster stood a head lower before Yang Yan—if he failed to show proper humility, wouldn’t that be disregarding his Grandmaster’s position?

He would never do anything to humiliate his master and ancestor.

Yang Kai’s eye twitched; he said no more. His strength was only Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, while this buck‑toothed warrior, though seemingly young, had already reached First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—no matter what, he could not casually call him Xiao Qi.

For a moment all eyes turned back to the Imperial Garden in the sky.

The humming sound filled the air without end, as the entire sky became shrouded in a storm of raging lightning serpents—countless in number. The smaller ones were only a foot long, while the larger ones coiled like true jiaos. The sight was utterly terrifying; gazing into the distance, it seemed that the entire region had become a world of thunderous dragons. Within the shroud of multicolored radiance, the Imperial Garden flickered faintly in and out of view, its form obscured—only endless lightning serpents and thunder dragons could be seen rolling and surging within.

The five‑element Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth kept converging into clusters, drifting upward and gathering toward where the Imperial Garden sat.

This strange manifestation was not confined to Dragon Lair Mountain and the vicinity of Tianyun City—the entire Dark Star was the same!

Nearly everyone witnessed the spectacle firsthand; under the overwhelming pressure of the celestial anomaly, even experts at Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm felt as insignificant as ants.

At a certain place on the Dark Star stood a towering mountain, reaching up ten thousand zhang into the clouds. Spiritual Qi swirled around the peaks; it was clearly a place with an excellent Earth Vein, otherwise the Spiritual Qi would not be so abundant.

The mountain was picturesque, with jagged rocks, yet many pavilions and halls nestled within—apparently the main seat of a sect’s headquarters.

Star Emperor Mountain!

This formidable presence that made the entire Dark Star tremble surpassed the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect; its name carried weight, yet Star Emperor Mountain conducted itself with extreme discretion. Its members rarely ventured out, so cultivators on the Dark Star seldom encountered those born of Star Emperor Mountain.

At this very moment, atop Star Emperor Mountain in a palace, a middle‑aged elder sat cross‑legged with an expression like still water and no ripples—there was not the slightest fluctuation of energy about him, and he appeared almost like a mortal.

The instant the celestial anomaly occurred, the middle‑aged elder calmly opened his eyes and gazed deeply toward the Imperial Garden. A brilliant light flashed across his eyes, as if he could pierce through layers of obstruction and discern the Garden’s movements.

After a long moment he raised an eyebrow and murmured to himself, "The Imperial Jade is about to appear?"

Saying that, the elder’s face brightened and he straightened. The moment he rose, an imposing aura spread from him that was in no way inferior to the woman surnamed Ye’s.

In the blink of an eye he vanished from where he was and reappeared several hundred zhang away. There, on a stone platform sat a cold‑faced youth who watched in consternation as a cluster of five‑colored Spiritual Qi floated up from the mountain.

Seeing the elder appear, the youth was shocked and hurriedly rose to bow, "Disciple greets Master."

If Yang Kai had been there he would have recognized the cold‑faced youth at once—this was the warrior Leng Qing whom he had met twice in the Flowing Flame Sandland!

This man had once caused a great stir at the Soul Cleansing Divine Water site, taking the best position and leaving Qu Changfeng helpless with anger; in the Flowing Flame Sandland’s Fourth Stage he had even crossed paths with Yang Kai.

At that time he was attacking the Taixuan Sect’s protective array.

If Yang Kai had to care about any peer on the Dark Star, Lu Ye would be one—this cold‑faced Leng Qing would be another.

However, Leng Qing had now advanced to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, a clear difference from when he had only been at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

"Mm, send orders to have the elders mobilize," the middle‑aged elder instructed indifferently.

Leng Qing froze and asked with folded hands, "Disciple dares to ask what Master wants the elders to do?"

“The Emperor Jades are about to appear. Have the Elders go and intercept them—this matter concerns the entry rights to the Imperial Garden. Tell them not to be careless under any circumstances. Even if they must seize them by force, they are to bring back as many as possible.”

"Yes!" Leng Qing, though half bewildered, dared not ask more and quickly withdrew to carry out the order.

After Leng Qing departed, the elder pressed a hand to his chest and coughed lightly, his face slightly pale.

He was wounded—whoever had such power as to so grievously injure an expert like him was unknown.

"If the Imperial Jade appears, the Imperial Garden’s opening cannot be far off. Damn it—of all times, to be wounded by that wench now!" the elder snarled, fury darkening his face.

Who exactly he meant by that insult was unknown.

Around Dragon Lair Mountain, all cultivators watched the Imperial Garden’s movements intently.

The celestial anomaly continued for about half a day before it suddenly shifted, jolting everyone who widened their eyes and focused even more nervously.

In the sky, the multicolored radiance that had wrapped the Imperial Garden visibly faded at speed and then shattered, vanishing completely.

At the same time the buzzing ceased and the five‑element Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth returned to calm, as if the previous disturbance had never occurred.

After their astonishment, the crowd scrutinized the Imperial Garden once more, and the next moment a cry of surprise rose in unison.

The Imperial Garden now looked somewhat different than before—much larger, and mysteriously dotted with many buildings that had not been seen earlier, as if those structures had been hidden until this celestial upheaval revealed them.

This discovery left everyone uncertain and uneasy; they could not tell whether the change was for better or worse.

"Right—the Imperial Garden is not singular…" Yang Yan muttered thoughtfully, "There is another half elsewhere. Only when the two combine will the Imperial Garden be complete and truly open!"

Hearing her, Yang Kai turned to look and saw Yang Yan frowning as if in deep thought.

At this moment the Imperial Garden appeared more imposing and magnificent than ever. An invisible force radiated from it, making everyone tremble.

Imperial Might!

The Imperial Might the transformed Imperial Garden emanated was more terrifying than before; its weight upon everyone forbade the slightest movement—only the sound of gulping could be heard.
