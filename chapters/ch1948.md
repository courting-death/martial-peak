## Chapter 1948 — Crushing

The market was bustling to the extreme; already crowded with people coming and going, and although the shop Yang Kai had rented sat in a remote spot, an incident here drew countless martial artists to gather and watch.

Those who arrived later did not know the whole story; they only saw the pitiful sight of the cultivator surnamed Jiang and, foreseeing his future ruined fate, their hearts sank and they glared angrily at Yang Kai as if he truly were an inept pill refiner who dared ruin his fellow disciples.

Naturally, some people knew this matter was not as simple as it appeared, but within Biyu Sect the disciples were cold toward one another and none had any ties with Yang Kai, so of course no one would step forward now to speak on his behalf and bring unnecessary trouble upon themselves.

Yang Kai read the crowd and knew that if today’s incident were not handled well, he would no longer be able to refine pills here to earn Source Crystals. Whether he continued refining pills or not was unimportant; he only feared the other side might have further schemes.

"Do you... do you have any proof that Senior Brother Jiang’s Qi Deviation was caused by the Spiritual Pill Brother Yang refined?" Liu Qianyun bit her teeth and asked, though her questioning sounded very pale and weak.

Chu Fei sneered: "Junior Brother Jiang is right here, what other evidence do you need?"

Liu Qianyun was momentarily speechless and anxiously looked to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai paused, then said, "Five days ago Senior Brother Jiang came to me asking for an Emperor Blood‑Yang Pill. Such a pill restores the power of Qi and blood — it might have interacted with some secret art he cultivates. At the time I gave him four pills; may I ask if he has any left? If there are any remaining pills, have the Sect's alchemy master inspect them and it will be clear whether there was anything wrong with my pills."

Liu Qianyun’s beautiful eyes brightened and she said excitedly, "Right, if there are leftover Spiritual Pills, asking someone to verify them would settle this, wouldn’t it?"

Chu Fei snorted, "All the Spiritual Pills have been taken by Junior Brother Jiang; where do you want me to find any leftovers?"

Yang Kai spread his hands: "If Senior Brother Chu says that, then there is no evidence at all and it’s pure slander; there is nothing I can do. This Junior Brother will not entertain this further. Senior Brothers, please go on your way. When you find evidence, come and argue with me then."

Saying that, Yang Kai turned to go back into the shop.

The other side was clearly looking for trouble; Yang Kai did not have the time or inclination to keep tangling with them.

"Think you can leave? You think you can get away?" Chu Fei's rage flared at Yang Kai’s attitude and he shouted, "Kill for a life, repay for a debt; you ruined Junior Brother Jiang to such a state and think you can walk away? Since when has the world been so easy?"

Yang Kai turned back, smiling faintly at Chu Fei and asked coldly, "Then what does Senior Brother Chu think should be done?"

"Come with me to appear before Protector Zhu and accept punishment!" Chu Fei barked.

"What a joke. I serve under Protector Bian; even if there is punishment, it is Protector Bian’s decision. Since when does Protector Zhu have jurisdiction?"

"How dare you be disrespectful to the Protector! Just joined the Sect and already so arrogant—what will you be like in the future? Let the Senior Brother teach you a lesson on how to be a proper Junior Brother!"

Chu Fei had come looking for a fight; at last finding an excuse to strike, he could no longer restrain himself. In mid-sentence he flashed to Yang Kai’s side like a gliding dragon and reached out to grab.

The Domain Field of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm surged out, completely enveloping Yang Kai as if it could bind the space around him, making the area viscous and his movements difficult.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he activated his own Domain Field to resist the suppression, and at the same time golden light shimmered on his hands; dozens of Golden Blood Threads suddenly appeared, coalescing into a long Golden Blood whip that lashed straight at Chu Fei.

Space seemed to be torn apart as the Golden Blood Threads carried a wild Qi and blood power, turning into a ferocious venomous serpent, its momentum terrifying, making people dare not lightly test its edge.

Chu Fei was startled.

He had originally thought the other was merely a newly inducted Second Stage of the Void King Realm Junior Brother, and at his own Third Stage of the Void King Realm level dealing with him would be trivial; he had not expected something off about Yang Kai the moment he struck out.

The opponent’s Domain Field was not weaker than his, but in fact stronger and more solid, so his own Domain Field suppression had no effect at all.

The overwhelming might packed into the single strike also showed that this Junior Brother’s Origin Qi surged within him; otherwise, with just one Stage difference, he would not have felt any pressure facing him.

As the Golden Blood Threads’ whip lashed, a chill rose in Chu Fei’s heart; without thinking he retracted his hand, snapped his fingers, and a mirror-like Secret Treasure appeared before him. Its light burst forth and the mysterious radiance shot from the mirror toward the Golden Blood Threads whip while forming a conical defense in front of him.

Snap...

With a soft crack, the Golden Blood Threads whip struck the mirror's arcane sheen, only to be deftly diverted to the side by a subtle force, failing to harm Chu Fei in the slightest.

This treasure mirror could redirect attacks?

But if that were all...

A feral smile crept to the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth.



Chu Fei screamed, and before he could react Yang Kai surged forward until he was almost against him; his right fist rose, shimmering with multicolored light like a colossal hammer descending, smashing toward Chu Fei’s face.

Chu Fei tried to resist, but found in horror that he had no power to oppose Yang Kai; that bizarre golden python technique and the exquisitely pure Domain Field suppression left him not even qualifying to exert force.

Boom...

With a muffled sound Chu Fei was slammed through the air, tumbling several times before landing heavily.

The crowd erupted! Every heart leapt and they watched that one-sided fight with mouths agape.

The clash between Yang Kai and Chu Fei was swift and over even swifter, happening in the blink of an eye—so fast Liu Qianyun had no time to intervene. Only now did she assume an attacking posture, but at the instant Chu Fei was flung aside she froze where she stood.

She found she had absolutely no room to intervene!

Her heart trembled; her beautiful eyes shuddered as she stared at Yang Kai in shock. She realized, with horror, that compared to the Yang Kai she had seen in the Starlight Passage, this man seemed incomparably stronger!

She never doubted for a moment that Yang Kai could handle Chu Fei; after all, this was the man who had taught Yin Lesheng a bitter lesson in the Starlight Passage.

Although Chu Fei was also Third Stage of the Void King Realm, not all his internal power had been converted into Origin Qi, so naturally he could not be compared with Yin Lesheng.

That Yang Kai could make Yin Lesheng suffer defeat means surpassing Chu Fei was naturally not a problem.

But she had not expected Yang Kai’s victory to come so easily.

That opponent did not look like a Third Stage of the Void King Realm at all; some might even believe he was a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Was this man really from a lower Star Domain? Had she not met him in the Starlight Passage, Liu Qianyun would not have believed it.

Liu Qianyun was stunned, and the Biyu Sect disciples watching were equally astonished and left speechless.

Especially those who knew Yang Kai was a pill refiner—they could hardly believe their eyes!

One must understand that although pill refiners also cultivate, because they spend so much time on alchemy their cultivation was usually not very high relative to their pill refining skills.

That Yang Kai could refine Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills and was himself a Void King Realm cultivator was already bizarre enough, and yet he, apparently at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, had so easily crushed a Third Stage Senior Brother!

Indeed, the scene before them could only be aptly described as crushing.

Yang Kai’s strange performance had truly blinded their eyes!

A disciple with such ferocious combat power, able to break the rules and crush higher ranked opponents while also mastering pill refining, would be hard not to receive attention; the watching Biyu Sect disciples looked at Yang Kai already foreseeing that after today the Sect would notice him and invest in his training. As for injuring a Senior Brother... in Biyu Sect, would that count as a serious matter?

Many were already considering how to befriend Yang Kai so that when he rose to prominence they could share in his fortunes.

The two Void King Realm cultivators who had come with Chu Fei were now pale-faced.

When Chu Fei and Yang Kai came to blows, they—like Liu Qianyun—had wanted to rush in to help, but in the blink of an eye Chu Fei was sprawled on the ground, his nose bruised and face swollen—entirely unlike the scene they'd expected.

In their expectations, naturally Yang Kai would be soundly taught by Chu Fei, then beg for mercy and allow them to do as they pleased...

But the cruel reality left them almost incapable of thought.

Yang Kai’s fierce gaze flicked toward them and both involuntarily took a step back.

One was First Stage of the Void King Realm and the other Second Stage; even together they were no match for Chu Fei, so how could they dare challenge Yang Kai?

Fortunately Yang Kai seemed to have no intention of making trouble for them; instead he walked step by step toward Chu Fei, narrowed his eyes and smiled, "Senior Brother Chu, we never knew one another before; now that we do, we can have a proper talk about Senior Brother Jiang’s Qi Deviation."

Upon hearing that, Chu Fei no longer dared lie there playing dead; he leapt up and barked in a show of bravado, "What do you want to do?"

"Senior Brother jokes. I’m new here, how dare I do anything to you? Hmm, I just want to talk." Yang Kai’s smile was affable, yet in Chu Fei’s eyes it looked like a grim specter that made him uneasy.

As he spoke Yang Kai clenched his fist and the knuckles cracked with popping sounds.

Chu Fei’s face was pale, bruises around his eyes, one eye swollen into a slit; he said bitterly, "I admit defeat this time, but don’t get any ideas!"

"Get ideas?" Yang Kai’s gaze bit cold. "Senior Brother slandered my reputation as a pill refiner without cause. If this matter is not resolved today, how am I to continue refining pills here afterward?"

"Then what do you want?" Chu Fei ground out.
