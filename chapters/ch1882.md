## Chapter 1882 — Fusion of Dragon Scale

Surrounded by a sea of spirit threads, Yang Kai felt he did not need to exert his cultivation; he could draw in the surrounding energy and make it his own at any moment.

In such an environment, a martial artist could absolutely grow at a speed of hundreds or even thousands of times faster.

He restrained his mind and picked up the second item.

It was the seventh Star Emperor Token he had taken from the Purple Star Treasure Vault.

It was no different from the previous six, almost identical—made of an unknown material, bearing a prominent character for Emperor on the front, and still containing remnants of Imperial Might.

After looking for a while, Yang Kai took out the other six tokens as well.

Seven Star Emperor Tokens gathered together, and suddenly a change occurred.

The seven tokens unexpectedly shot out of Yang Kai’s hand uncontrollably, then darted about in front of him and, in the blink of an eye, formed a peculiar shape.

Its form hinted at an eight-part formation, but with sections missing and corners left open.

Yang Kai understood immediately—two Star Emperor Tokens were missing, so the full pattern could not be completed.

After hovering for a while, the seven Star Emperor Tokens suddenly fell downward; Yang Kai swept out his hand and caught them all, stroking them for a moment before putting them into his Spatial Ring.

He shifted his gaze to the final two items.

One was a palm-sized scale; it looked like a fish scale but was covered in intricate patterns that gave it a ferocious feel, an extremely ancient aura flowing from the scale.

Dragon scale! A genuine True Dragon Scale.

With the Dragon Scale before him, the Dragon Bone in Yang Kai’s body seemed to be stirred as well; his Dragon Bone Sword began to hum incessantly, and he had to exert considerable effort to suppress it.

Such a Dragon Scale, in terms of value, was even superior to the Earth Vein Crystal he had obtained earlier. It had been accidentally acquired by an ancestor of Purple Star generations ago; unfortunately, over the years no one on Purple Star had been able to make full use of it. Even Kuang Shizong had once taken notice of this scale but could not succeed, and in the end had to painstakenly abandon the attempt and lock it away in the Treasure Vault.

If a Grandmaster-level artificer used this Dragon Scale as the primary material to craft a Secret Treasure, it would unquestionably become an Upper-Level Void King-Grade Secret Treasure; whether made into an offensive Secret Treasure or a defensive one, it could dominate the entire Star Domain.

Of course, the Dragon Scale was exceptionally sturdy; using it to make a defensive Secret Treasure—especially forging it into a shield—was the best choice.

Unfortunately, even a Void King-Grade artificer might not be able to smelt such a scale—unless they possessed a special divine fire.

Yang Kai was not an artificer and naturally could not smelt the scale, but he had an advantage others did not.

He carried within him the Origin of the Golden Sacred Dragon!

The True Dragon race placed the Golden Sacred Dragon above all, the head of ten thousand dragons. With the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin in his body and having once obtained the Yao Transformation Technique from Lady Chi Yue, Yang Kai could completely refine this Dragon Scale into his body, merging the True Dragon Secret Treasure into himself and obtaining a portion of the True Dragon’s divine abilities.

Dragon Scales were a kind of True Dragon Secret Treasure, and so were Dragon Bones.

The Dragon Bone Sword was forged from a section of Dragon Bone and a single Dragon Pearl. When Yang Kai refined it back then, he hadn’t completed the process—more accurately, he didn’t have the ability to fully refine it. At the time, he had merely followed a technique Yang Yan taught him, using his own body as the furnace to temper the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl within himself.

This method fully preserved the efficacy of the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl.

In other words, Yang Kai now possessed three True Dragon Secret Treasures: a Dragon Scale, a section of a Dragon spine bone, and a Dragon Pearl!

If he could use the Yao Transformation Technique to completely fuse those three True Dragon Secret Treasures into his body, his strength would increase dramatically.

Others could not accomplish this; only Yang Kai, who bore the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin, could achieve it.

He did not rush, instead looking at the last object.

It was a hexagonal crystal, somewhat similar in appearance to an Earth Vein Crystal, yet entirely different. An Earth Vein Crystal keeps its energy hidden, showing nothing on the surface—only by probing it with Divine Sense can one perceive the vast power contained within.

This hexagonal crystal emitted energy outward; even someone as strong as Yang Kai felt a thread of pressure standing before it.

This crystal was the Void Mind Crystal separated out from that mysterious auction item. Such a thing can only be formed within the body of a Third-Stage Void King Realm expert, and it contains the lifetime Martial Dao insights of a Third-Stage Void King Realm powerhouse.

The Void Mind Crystal posed a deadly temptation to any Void King Realm warrior; its lure was even more intense than a Domain Stone.

A Domain Stone merely allowed a Void King Realm expert to comprehend a Domain’s power and better temper their own Domain Field, but a Void Mind Crystal could propel a Void King Realm expert further!

This was precisely what Yang Kai most urgently needed.

The Fenggang Silver that wrapped the Void Mind Crystal had already been divided between Xiaoxiao and the Fire Bird; if he could absorb the energies within this Void Mind Crystal, Yang Kai believed that even if he could not instantly rise to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and reach the pinnacle of the Star Domain, his Martial Dao path would still become significantly smoother.

After staring back and forth between the Void Mind Crystal and the Dragon Scale for a long time, Yang Kai made his decision and put the Void Mind Crystal away.

He decided to refine the Dragon Scale first.

Absorbing the Void Mind Crystal would take a great deal of time and could not be completed quickly; he still had many matters to attend to and it was not suitable to speculate on the mysteries of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm right now.

As for the three True Dragon Secret Treasures, the Dragon Bone Sword already contained the Dragon spine bone and the Dragon Pearl and could still exert some effect in Yang Kai’s hands, so naturally only the Dragon Scale remained to be refined.

Thinking this, Yang Kai no longer hesitated; he held the Dragon Scale in his palm, closed his eyes, immersed his Divine Sense, and began to study the latter half of the Yao Transformation Technique.

The Yao Transformation Technique was the yao’s supreme classic, capable of drawing out a trace of ancestral blood power from any yao; every yao’s body flowed with the blood of ancient great yao, and the Yao Transformation Technique could draw that hidden power forth.

This was the emphasis of the first half of the Yao Transformation Technique.

The latter half contained a chapter explaining how to fuse parts of an ancient great yao’s body for one’s own use.

Strictly speaking, the True Dragon race was also yao—only it was born as a Yao Emperor—and True Dragon Secret Treasures were naturally compatible with the Yao Transformation Technique.

After spending ten days, Yang Kai comprehended the Yao Transformation Technique thoroughly and then put it into action.

He opened his eyes, exhaled lightly with a resolute look, and, with fingers like a blade, cut his wrist.

In the next moment a wound opened on his wrist and golden blood seeped out; his powerful regenerative ability began to heal instantly, the wound visibly closing as if it would be fully mended the next moment.

Yang Kai acted swiftly, pressing the Dragon Scale onto the wound while using the secret method of the Yao Transformation Technique to force the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin within him out and pour it into the Dragon Scale.

Hum……

A strange sound issued forth and a vast phantom dragon head suddenly appeared above the scale. That dragon head looked more majestic and terrifying than any dragon head Yang Kai had ever seen; in its presence he could not help but feel minuscule as an ant.

The dragon head blinked its enormous eyes and stared at Yang Kai with no emotion; supreme dragon might pressed into his chest.

Roar……

A dragon’s roar that shook heaven and earth exploded in Yang Kai’s ears; the sound carried an unchallengeable majesty that made his heart race.

Dragon might spread!

Yang Kai met the dragon head’s gaze coldly, showing no retreat.

After a long while, the phantom dragon head trembled slightly then suddenly transformed into a beam of golden light that shot into the Dragon Scale.

At the same time, this scale—which had fallen from a true dragon tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years ago—seemed to be given life, becoming ravenously thirsty and greedily devouring Yang Kai’s blood.

Glug, glug……

The sounds from the scale were clear; visible to the eye, Yang Kai’s blood flowed into the scale, dyeing it a brilliant golden hue.

A wave of dizziness and heart-fluttering discomfort suddenly welled up from his chest. Yang Kai’s expression tightened, and not daring to take it lightly, he immediately erupted a drop of his pure Golden Blood to replenish the blood he had just lost.

A high, exultant dragon cry echoed from within the scale as if it were ecstatic, devouring without restraint.

Yang Kai’s blood contained unimaginable life force—especially the pure Golden Blood he had condensed with his Life Jade Nectar; any single drop of Golden Blood possessed the power to restore flesh and bone.

Such a substance was exactly what was indispensable to refining a True Dragon Secret Treasure.

Time passed, and Yang Kai released ten drops of pure Golden Blood, but the Dragon Scale still seemed unsatisfied and continued to consume without restraint.

The entire scale had turned pure golden, its dragon might greater than before.

At one point Yang Kai suddenly felt the flow of his blood stop; he rejoiced inwardly, knowing he had finally satiated the scale. Looking closely, the once impenetrable scale had become a puddle of golden light, flowing like water and wrapping around the wound on his arm.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, braced himself, and with a thought the wound produced a faint suction that drew the flowing golden scale into his body.

The next instant, his eyes flew wide open. One hand clamped over the wound as his whole body trembled, his face turning deathly pale in a heartbeat. Beads of sweat the size of beans welled up on his forehead and streamed down, soaking his clothes in moments.

Unimaginable pain came from the wound, amplified as if by ten million times, fiercely assaulting Yang Kai’s flesh and nerves.

He gritted his teeth and endured, but in the end could not hold back—a terrible scream burst forth, reverberating throughout the Small Xuan Realm.

Despite the agonizing pain, Yang Kai’s sensations had become countless times clearer than usual; he could distinctly feel the Dragon Scale he had drawn into his body slowly writhing along the flow of his blood, crawling upward through his arm.

Each wriggle brought pain as if his body were being crushed to pieces.

He cried out in torment.

After all, he was the only living person in the Small Xuan Realm, so there was no need to worry about losing face.

Xiaoxiao, who was refining minerals, and the Fire Bird, which was fusing the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame, both looked up upon hearing the sound; worry appeared in the eyes of these two aides as if fearing something had befallen Yang Kai.
