## Chapter 1199 — A Chance Meeting with Chang Qi

That Yang Kai had managed to come here was no surprise to Chang Qi. Others might not know how capable Yang Kai truly was, but he did. He had personally witnessed every battle in which Yang Kai fought against cultivators of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. For someone like that to fail to make it through the Heat-Flame Zone would have been utterly unreasonable.

What pleased Chang Qi was that the two of them actually had the chance to run into each other here.

"Where's Guest Elder Hao?" Yang Kai glanced behind him, not seeing Hao An, and hurriedly asked.

"Old Hao didn't come in with me; we haven't seen him since we entered. But don't worry—though he's old, his skill is enough to cross the First Layer's Heat-Flame Zone without issue," Chang Qi said with a smile, and only then turned his gaze to Shen Shitao and the others, asking with surprise and suspicion, "These people are..."

"We're from Qiantian Sect," Shen Shitao said with pursed lips and a smile, thinking silently that that old man must belong to the same clan as the youth; it appeared they weren't from any great family, otherwise they wouldn't send such an elderly person.

"Qiantian Sect!" Unlike Yang Kai, Chang Qi's expression immediately turned grave at those three words, and he clasped his fists hastily: "So it's the Qiantian Sect—my apologies, my apologies!"

He looked at Yang Kai with suspicion, unable to understand how Yang Kai had come to be connected with people from the Qiantian Sect. The Qiantian Sect's power was no weaker than Yingyue Hall; though they hadn't produced outstanding disciples in recent years, their accumulated foundation and reserves were solid and their reputation sounded through the lands.

Thus when Shen Shitao said they were from Qiantian Sect, of course he dared not be rude.

"This is the proper reaction from someone of humble origin upon hearing Qiantian Sect," Shen Shitao thought privately; the awkwardness caused earlier by Yang Kai's coldness vanished.

"Guest Elder Chang, were you after that Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object?" Yang Kai asked anxiously.

"Yes!" Chang Qi slapped his thigh, his face full of regret. "That thing was practically sentient. At first I thought it was an ordinary little snake, but the moment I approached, it transformed into a streak of fire and flew off. I've never seen anything that could fly across the Flowing Flame Sandland like that."

Hearing this, everyone shuddered.

The Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object had flashed past earlier, thrilling everyone and making them forget that the laws here forbade all flight; thinking back on it now, it was truly astonishing.

That thing was extraordinary! The thought surged in everyone's minds, and the five members of Qiantian Sect's eyes burned with excitement.

"Quick, chase it!" Yang Kai said, and immediately dashed toward the direction where the red light had vanished. Chang Qi hesitated a moment, then hurried to keep pace, running shoulder to shoulder with Yang Kai.

"Senior Sister Shen..." The pockmarked man licked his dry lips and murmured, "He's truly a man of great fortune!"

Earlier when Shen Shitao had said the youth was extremely lucky, they had half-believed her. Who would have thought that upon meeting him they'd encounter a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object? Such things were rare and priceless. Seeing the evidence before them, they could no longer doubt and looked upon Shen Shitao with admiration, convinced she had a keen eye.

"What shall we do?" another female cultivator asked.

"Chase!" Shen Shitao stamped her foot and shot forward. The other four quickly unfolded their footwork, activated their Saint Yuan, and pushed their speed to the limit.

"Yang Kai, those Qiantian Sect elites..." Chang Qi anxiously glanced back at the five who had joined them.

"I'm not acquainted with them. We're merely strangers crossing paths," Yang Kai smiled. "Don't bother with them—if we can catch that Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object, just seize it. Whoever snatches it gets it. If they try to take it by force, we won't be polite either."

"Good, hearing that I can relax," Chang Qi said, visibly relieved and suddenly full of zeal.

He had come to the Flowing Flame Sandland seeking chance; now the opportunity lay before him. Never mind Qiantian Sect's disciples—even if Battle Sky Alliance or Leitai Sect members stood in his way, he would strive for it. One didn't have many years left; dying mattered little if it was for the Martial Dao.

Although the two groups—six in total—had pushed their speed to the extreme, the inability to fly here still caused great trouble. Yang Kai had delayed a few breaths waiting for Chang Qi, so now the fleeing firelight had become far out of reach. He could only follow the path it had taken and carefully sense the leftover vitality and Spiritual Qi it had left behind.

That way they would not lose the trail.

"Guest Elder Chang, describe carefully what the Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object looked like," Yang Kai asked amid his busyness.

"Didn’t see it clearly—only that it looked like a small cyan snake, curled motionless on a bed of Soul-Nourishing Flowers. I was gathering those flowers when I found it," Chang Qi replied.

"Soul-Nourishing Flowers?" Yang Kai frowned. As an alchemist, he knew the effects of herbs. Soul-Nourishing Flower was a Saint King-Grade herb whose fragrance could calm and steady the soul, nourishing the spirit—useful in refining certain Pills.

But a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object was itself a kind of spiritual herb or medicine; why would it absorb the scent of Soul-Nourishing Flowers?

Could that little snake-like spiritual object have already birthed a divine soul and gained awareness? Even so, it shouldn’t be particularly interested in Soul-Nourishing Flowers.

Odd indeed.

While Yang Kai and Chang Qi spoke, Shen Shitao and the others behind them were astonished.

They found that Yang Kai's speed at First Stage of the Saint King Realm matched theirs so closely that no matter how they tried, they couldn't catch him.

Shen Shitao was greatly surprised and couldn't make sense of this First-Stage Saint King cultivator.

Not long after, Yang Kai and Chang Qi stopped on a plain.

The plain was covered with tall grass, reaching two to three men in height, dense and flourishing. Yet when Yang Kai swept the area with his Divine Sense, he was surprised to find that there were no Spiritual Herbs or Spiritual Medicines here at all. It seemed that the fertile soil of this place was suited only for the growth of weeds.

This situation made little sense.

The trail of vitality and aura the firelight had left along the way ended here; whether it hid or vanished for some other reason was unknown.

But Yang Kai was certain the little snake-like Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object must be hiding here.

"Let's split up to search. With so many weeds it will be hard—watch for unusual energy fluctuations. There might be some kind of sealing formation here," Yang Kai said calmly.

"Alright." Chang Qi nodded and immediately separated from Yang Kai.

Moments later Shen Shitao and the others arrived, seeing Yang Kai and Hao An vanish into the grass. The four turned their eyes to Shen Shitao.

"We'll split up too!" Shen Shitao decided on the spot; the Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object was within reach, and no one could remain unmoved.

The five from Qiantian Sect likewise dispersed in different directions like Yang Kai and Chang Qi and began to search.

Hunting in such a place was vexing; even if Yang Kai's Divine Sense was strong and broad, it offered little advantage—who knew how that Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object hid itself without revealing a shred of a trace.

After searching for two full shi, Yang Kai was considering giving up and not wasting time here when suddenly he felt an energy fluctuation from about ten li away.

Someone had discovered something. Yang Kai's expression brightened and he streaked toward that spot.

A short while later, Yang Kai arrived at the source of the energy fluctuations and found that the five members of Qiantian Sect had all gathered there. They were surrounding an opening that looked like an earthen cave, their faces filled with barely contained excitement. Each of them craned their necks to peer inside, yet none dared to venture in rashly.

The pockmarked man was speaking with Shen Shitao, explaining that he had accidentally hit something unusual and struck out a hole—who knew whether it was blessing or calamity.

Unsure if the hole contained fortune or peril, he had sent word to Shen Shitao and the others to gather and discuss how to proceed.

When Yang Kai arrived, the five glanced at him but did not drive him away, forming a circle to continue their deliberations.

After a moment, Chang Qi came as well, evidently arriving upon hearing the commotion like Yang Kai had.

"Found it?" Chang Qi looked at the hole, his eyes brightening.

"Not sure." Yang Kai shook his head; he saw nothing noteworthy from the hole's mouth, yet the presence of such an opening was intriguing enough to warrant exploration.

But since others had discovered it first, Yang Kai couldn't be the first to venture down. Doing so would surely earn the Qiantian Sect's enmity, so he could only wait.

As Shen Shitao and the others argued, they frequently glanced at Yang Kai—some shaking heads, others nodding, as if some dispute had arisen.

Shen Shitao spoke a few words swiftly, and those who had shaken their heads were forced to nod in agreement.

Reaching consensus, Shen Shitao suddenly smiled and walked over to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai remained composed; though unsure of her intention, he felt no malice from her.

"Little brother, would you and this elder like to go down the hole and take a look?" Shen Shitao asked.

"You'd let us go in?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised.

"Of course. Though my Junior Brother discovered the hole, we did pursue to this place together, and you too share in the credit for finding it," Shen Shitao smiled slightly.

"It's not so simple—what's the catch?" Yang Kai said with a thoughtful smile.

Shen Shitao was taken aback, then covered her mouth and laughed softly: "Little brother, you truly understand. I'll be frank: no one knows what's in this hole; there may be opportunities—or hidden calamities. You know the Flowing Flame Sandland is full of danger. The hole looks ordinary, but who knows what perils lie below? We few are not eager to go down..."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and said nothing, indicating she should continue.

"You seem to always have great luck, so I thought perhaps you'd go down first to scout. With your fortune you should avoid many risks. Of course, decide for yourself—if unwilling, we won't force you," Shen Shitao said.

So she wanted him to scout ahead! Yang Kai suddenly understood.

He had to accept. Even if they hadn't asked, he would have gone down himself; now that they invited him, it was proper and justified.
