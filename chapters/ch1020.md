## Chapter 1020 — Attempt

"Where on earth did you get these things?" the Ghost Ancestor asked again.

Yang Kai answered honestly.

The two Jet-Black Spheres were obtained by coincidence from different places, and the Blood Essence Stone had been snatched from someone else — he had already possessed it back on Tongxuan Continent.

Yang Kai only understood the function and use of the Blood Essence Stone and had used it many times, but he did not know what those two Jet-Black Spheres actually were.

"Senior, do you recognize these two strange stones?" Yang Kai watched his expression and asked tentatively.

Strange light flashed in the Ghost Ancestor's eyes as he fixed his gaze on the two Jet-Black Spheres, studying the complex patterns on them and listening to the stirrings within; after a long while he nodded and said, "It seems you don't know what these are..."

"Please enlighten me, senior!" Yang Kai said, his expression serious.

The Ghost Ancestor grinned, tossed the Blood Essence Stone and the two Jet-Black Spheres back into the Demon God's Secret Codex, then handed the Demon God's Secret Codex to Yang Kai with a cryptic tone: "Nurture them well; one day you'll understand. Hmm, these things require a great deal of mineral essence — if you don't have minerals, a Secret Treasure will do."

Having said that strange, disconnected remark, he vanished.

Yang Kai was left standing in the sky, bewildered.

The Ghost Ancestor clearly didn't want to tell Yang Kai what he knew, which left him annoyed.

Yet the Ghost Ancestor's words were intriguing: he had told him to "nurture" the two Jet-Black Spheres — what was there to nurture? They weren't living things.

Unable to unravel the mystery, Yang Kai didn't waste any more thought on it; he ordered the Divine Tree to continue monitoring the Jet-Black Spheres and stored the Demon God's Secret Codex within his body.

When he returned to the flat stretch halfway up the mountain, the moment Yang Kai appeared, he immediately felt a murderous glare sweeping toward him.
That gaze came from Yue Xi!

Her strength had long since recovered; the Ghost Ancestor had never intended to imprison her forever. These past days she had remained by the mountainside, listless, no longer the poised, noble beauty she once had been. Now her hair was disheveled, a biting hate burned in her beautiful eyes, and she stared fixedly at Yang Kai.

It was as if she wished she could swallow him whole.

Although she had learned everything from He Zao and He Miao — that Yang Kai had not actually harmed them but merely left them in the stone chamber as a form of punishment for her earlier rudeness — Yue Xi still found it hard to accept. She felt this younger man was arrogant to the point of contempt, excessively wanton and dangerous.

She treated her previous ordeal as an unbearable humiliation and nursed her resentment in secret.

For now, forced to remain under the same roof, she dared not take any overtly extreme action and instead vented her dissatisfaction and anger through hostile looks.

Yang Kai seemed not to notice her at all; he walked straight into the mountain and disappeared.

Yue Xi closed her beautiful eyes, drew in a deep breath, and calmed herself.

"That brat thinks he can be safe under the Ghost Ancestor's protection, yet he doesn't know death is at his door," Lü Guichen suddenly appeared beside Yue Xi and sneered softly. "Once the Ghost Ancestor can leave here, he certainly won't spare him — then it will be his last day!"

"Why tell me this?" Yue Xi opened her eyes and glanced coldly at Lü Guichen.

"Don't you hate him? He killed one of your disciples and dragged your two female disciples into a cave — who knows what they suffered. I think you know better than I; he has humiliated you. Don't you hate him? Don't you want to kill him with your own hands?"

"That is my business, none of yours!" Yue Xi snorted.

Lü Guichen smiled. "Of course it concerns me — I want his life too."

"Is that so? Then why were you fawning over him not long ago?"

Lü Guichen's face turned awkward; he pinched his nose and said, "The situation forced me. Do you think I enjoy showing weakness to people like him? If not for the Ghost Ancestor's protection, a man like him I could kill with a flick of my hand!"

"Lü Guichen, I'll ask you one question — answer honestly!" Yue Xi suddenly looked at him seriously.

"What?"

"My disciple Wei Wu... has he long since been linked with your Purple Star faction? What did you promise him to make him betray me and the Sword Alliance?" Yue Xi demanded in a low voice.

Lü Guichen's eyes flickered; he chuckled lightly. "What do you mean? I don't quite follow."

"You know in your heart! I'll settle this with you sooner or later. Also, if you want that brat's life, go kill him yourself — don't try to provoke me and use my hands. I'm not that stupid!" Yue Xi said, then turned and left, clearly ashamed to be associated with Lü Guichen.

Lü Guichen's face grew dark as he watched her retreating figure.

He hadn't expected Yue Xi to swallow her anger. Normally, if her two female disciples had been taken into the cave and humiliated by Yang Kai, she would have rushed in without regard for anything. Lü Guichen couldn't understand why she didn't act.

Inside the mountain chamber, Yang Kai sat by the spirit brook, watching the water flow and fell into thought.

The Ghost Ancestor's words today had cleared a layer of mist for him, making new possibilities he hadn't seen before come into view.

Could the two kinds of power in his body truly be fused together?

He cultivated the True Yang Technique; his body contained Saint Yuan of True Yang, while the energy concealed within the Indomitable Golden Body was filled with sinister might.

Whenever he used them, he could only call upon one at a time — the other had to be set aside.

He had always thought the True Yang Saint Yuan existed to suppress the Indomitable Golden Body's evil might, but upon reflection that might not be the case.

Even when he used the Demon God Transformation and his body filled with wicked energy, he did not lose his reason or humanity; he did not become a demon who abandoned kin.

He had never considered forcing two such mutually opposed, mutually suppressive natures to blend together; he could hardly imagine what that would be like.

So now he felt somewhat at a loss.

But since the Ghost Ancestor said it, there must be a reason — on such matters Yang Kai chose to trust him.

He pondered for a long while but couldn't grasp the method.

He steeled himself and prepared to try.

Calming his breath and gathering his spirit, Yang Kai guided the True Yang Saint Yuan in his flesh and meridians back into his dantian.

After a moment, the power within his flesh was entirely drained, leaving him feeling hollow and uneasy.

He had felt this sudden loss of power several times before, always as the result of overexertion; but it was the first time he had willingly dispersed his strength.

Then he carefully drew a portion of the True Yang Saint Yuan from his dantian and led it into his meridians.

He then drew from the Indomitable Golden Body, extracting an equal portion of the evil energy and channeling it into the same location.

When these two opposing energies met, Yang Kai's body trembled and pain flickered across his face; he felt a violent clash where those two forces occupied the same space, as if two warrior armies with mortal hatred had met and were fighting to the death — the conflict caused searing pain, his meridians bulged, and if he listened closely he could even hear a sizzling crackle from within.

The True Yang Saint Yuan and the evil energy were colliding and dissolving one another.

Yang Kai grunted and his face darkened.

In a short time both energies had been completely annihilated, leaving not a trace.

The first attempt ended in failure!

Yang Kai frowned. It was his first time allowing two kinds of power to coexist within his meridians, and he hadn’t expected it to bring back such a tormenting sensation.

The reason the Evil Energy and his True Yang Saint Yuan could coexist within him was because they were stored in entirely separate places and had never mingled. Forcing them to merge together was indeed an arduous task.

"Yang Kai, are you all right?" He Zao's voice came from outside, apparently startled by the commotion.

"I'm fine." Yang Kai looked up to see the sisters He Zao and He Miao standing outside, both seeming hesitant; Yang Kai stirred and asked, "You came to see me?"

"We want to go out to be with our master... it's been more than half a month; she must be worried about us, and you should let off some steam too," He Zao said, pursing her lips and appearing embarrassed.

"Didn't you already send her word?" Yang Kai smiled lightly. "Why would she still worry?"

"You knew?" He Zao was stunned.

"Did you think I didn't know?" Yang Kai looked at them amusedly, then pondered for a moment and said, "Go tell your master how I stand: if she dares to harbor hatred and waits for an opportunity to retaliate, I will not spare her!"

He Zao nodded, frowning slightly. “I’ll try to talk to her—but you shouldn’t be so relentless either. My Master is… older, after all.”

Yang Kai closed his eyes again. He Zao and He Miao exchanged a helpless look, shrugged, and left.

After they left, Bi Ya appeared leisurely. Watching their departing backs, she snorted lightly and then peeked toward Yang Kai.

"Come in!" Yang Kai beckoned.

Bi Ya's eyes lit up as she glided in, graceful and alluring, taking her place before Yang Kai; an invisible ripple emanated from her figure, making her shine.

"Does Master have any orders?"

"Tell me something: have you ever seen anyone perfectly fuse two completely different types of power together?" Yang Kai asked, looking at her.

"Two completely different powers?" Bi Ya was surprised.

"For example, water and fire, life and death, light and darkness..."

"How could that be done? Each power's mysteries are profound; even those great experts might spend their whole lives and still not comprehend one fully. Trying to fuse water and fire is unrealistic — their natures are mutually antagonistic." Bi Ya laughed coquettishly, unaware why Yang Kai suddenly asked such an odd question. "But if someone truly mastered the truths of both water and fire, perhaps they could do it. In all my life I have never seen such a strange person."
