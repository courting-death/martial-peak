## Chapter 572 — Flourishing Prosperity

“And what about the three of you?” Yang Kai asked, curious as he looked at them.

“We?” Meng Wuya chuckled and pointed at Earth Demon. “This old demon is now just an ordinary First Stage of the Transcendent Realm because he just broke through. But since he has reached this level, given his foundation and experience, as long as his power keeps pace, he will continue to break through without any bottlenecks.”

“A bright future lies ahead,” Yang Kai said as he glanced at Earth Demon, who let out a mocking chuckle, nodding his head proudly with an unusually confident expression.

“Brother Ling, just a month ago, was on par with Li Yuanchun at the limit of the First Stage. But now... he has reached the Second Stage.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn and joyful as he looked at Ling Taixu. “Congratulations, Grandmaster.”

No wonder Ling Taixu seemed a bit different compared to over a month ago—it was because he had broken through an entire stage.

“As for me...” Meng Wuya hesitated before saying, “After lifting one of my seals, I’m roughly at the limit of the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm.”

Meng Wuya’s tone was neither arrogant nor boastful; he stated it in an extremely matter-of-fact way. In fact, he seemed quite dissatisfied with the strength he displayed after removing the seal.

Yang Kai’s expression turned strange. Dissatisfied with the limit of the Second Stage? Just how far-reaching was Shopkeeper Meng’s vision?

“What about the Six Evil Kings and Evil Lord Yang Bai?” Yang Kai’s face grew serious.

“Among the Six Evil Kings, except for the woman, the other five are all at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm. The Heaven-Dominating Force King and Lightning Shadow King can even contend with me after I lifted my seal. The woman is a bit weaker, only at the First Stage, but she’s still young. For her age, such cultivation is already remarkable.”

“Shan Qingluo has a special constitution. It seems she inherited much cultivation from her mother,” Yang Kai explained.

“No wonder,” Meng Wuya immediately understood. He seemed quite concerned about Shan Qingluo and had never figured out how, at her age, she could reach the Transcendent Realm.

“As for Evil Lord Yang Bai... you can probably guess his cultivation.”

“Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm?” Yang Kai asked in horror.

“Correct!” Meng Wuya nodded gravely. “Across the world, it seems he alone has attained the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm. Even among your Zhongdu Eight Great Families, there is no one like him!”

Ling Taixu sighed softly, “Now you should understand why that night the three of us could easily defeat their eight, while over a month ago, those seven were all slaughtered under the hands of the Three Great Evil Kings.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded firmly.

Without understanding the subdivision of the Transcendent Realm, no one could accept how those seven were wiped out in just half a teacup’s time against three Second Stage Evil Kings, including a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast.

But once understanding the Stages, Yang Kai realized the vast difference in strength.

Those seven were only First Stage. Facing three Second Stage Evil Kings and a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast, how could they hold?

Neither the world nor they themselves had a clear grasp of their relative strength.

But Meng Wuya saw through it immediately.

“Among the Zhongdu Eight Great Families, each family has four or five Transcendent Realm experts, but at most one at the Second Stage level. Some families don’t even have such people—others are stuck at the First Stage. In terms of top expert numbers, your Eight Great Families hold the absolute advantage. But over there in Cangyun Evil Land is Yang Bai... His presence is a huge wild card.”

“And what’s the situation in Zhongdu now?”

“Unknown,” Meng Wuya shook his head. “Until the end, no one can foresee the outcome.”

Yang Kai sighed lightly.

“That’s why I never dared explain the secret of the Transcendent Realm to you before—afraid you would be discouraged while your strength was still meager,” Meng Wuya smiled and shook his head. “You thought ascending beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was the martial peak, but that’s not so.”

“Discouraged?” Yang Kai suddenly smiled, “I wasn’t discouraged. In fact, I feel my goals are clearer now.”

The three were stunned, staring curiously at Yang Kai, then relief spread across their faces.

Before learning the secrets of the Transcendent Realm, Yang Kai’s goal had merely been beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. But after hearing all this from Meng Wuya, the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm became his pursuit.

They could foresee Yang Kai would pursue this aim tirelessly, perhaps in five years, ten years, or longer he would ascend to that highest level.

After leaving Meng Wuya, Yang Kai was full of energy and immediately sought out Su Yan, sitting cross-legged with her on the ice-cold bed to cultivate together.

Everything in the mansion proceeded in orderly fashion.

A month later, all martial artists had thoroughly purified their essence and marrow. Even over fifty Divine Roaming Realm practitioners from overseas sects gained immense benefit.

With the help of the Mystery Grade Pill supplied from the Alchemy Room, they found themselves reluctant to leave. They had originally intended to quickly reclaim their sect treasures from Yang Kai and depart, but the generosity here made them linger.

Another month passed, and the nine Blood Servants under Yang Kai finally brought good news.

With the aid of Wan Yao Ling Paste and three months in seclusion, they all broke through to the Transcendent Realm in succession.

Each breakthrough was accompanied by wondrous cosmic phenomena, which lasted a full half month until all nine completed their breakthroughs.

Li Yuanchun and these overseas warriors were astonished.

Throughout the overseas, only Tai Yi Sect had three Transcendent Realm masters stationed.

But in Yang Kai’s mansion, they witnessed the birth of nine top-tier experts. It stirred immense respect and curiosity in their hearts.

There was no reasonable explanation for such a string of breakthroughs in so short a time; the implications were intriguing.

Could this young Master Yang be capable of single-handedly nurturing experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm? Li Yuanchun’s mind grimly entertained such a fearsome notion.

If so, this Yang would dominate the world someday.

Such a person must be befriended, never offended!

The breakthroughs of Tu Feng and others also left them feeling unreal.

Before the Succession War began, all nine only reached the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Though they had aimed for the Transcendent Realm, success seemed unlikely.

Since the founding of the Blood Servants Hall by Yang Kai, only Huang Jiuzhou had reached this realm, holding the title Grand Elder of the Yang Family.

The Blood Servants Hall’s Master Feng Sheng and Deputy Zhou Feng had remained stuck for many years at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm with no breakthrough.

Among the nine Blood Servants, only Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu had the aptitude to rival them. The Yang Family had regarded them highly, believing they could transcend the Divine Roaming Realm.

Now all nine had reached this realm.

It was breathtaking, like living in a dream.

After breaking through, all nine were summoned by Meng Wuya, where they gained immense and precious experience and understanding of the Transcendent Realm.

Such insight was impossible for the Eight Great Families to provide.

They all gained greatly and became clear on their futures.

The four Blood Servants who once served Yang Wei and Yang Zhao had now been fully absorbed by Yang Kai and were being vigorously cultivated with mansion resources. After more than three months, they had reached the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm and, after being given Wan Yao Ling Paste, had entered seclusion.

In a few months, they were expected to catch up with the other nine Blood Servants.

The Blood Servants’ progress was heartening, and the cultivation of warriors from other mansion factions advanced rapidly as well.

After refining their marrow and essence and improving their physiques, everyone felt their cultivation was swifter and more effective than before. Especially the young generation leaders, naturally gifted, had become extraordinary talents—true geniuses.

Everything within the mansion was flourishing, seemingly untouched by the grim situation caused by Cangyun Evil Land’s large-scale invasion.

Yet Yang Kai remained vigilant over the happenings in Zhongdu.

Shan Qingluo stayed in War City, monitoring Yang Kai’s mansion. From her reports, Yang Kai received precise and up-to-date intelligence.

The first battle Cangyun Evil Land fought upon arriving in Zhongdu was against the Gao Family, then, like autumn wind sweeping fallen leaves, they advanced rapidly to expand their territory.

Yang Bai’s overwhelming power and the other five Evil Kings’ cunning tactics repeatedly humiliated the Eight Great Families’ experts, unable to mount effective resistance.

The Meng, Kang, and Qiu Families successively withdrew from their long-held lands, with elite clan members seeking refuge among other families.

In three months, half of Zhongdu had fallen.

Vast Zhongdu City was now divided into two. Evil Land forces entrenched in the northern half, while those of the Eight Great Families, centered around the Yang Family, held the south, each side locked in stalemate.

Three months of fierce battles had caused heavy casualties on both sides. Over a dozen Transcendent Realm experts had fallen, most from the Eight Great Families and only a few from Cangyun Evil Land.

Below the Transcendent Realm, casualties were incalculable.

Zhongdu was filled with wails of mourning; the stench of corpses pervaded the land.

Only now did the fighting subside somewhat, and the situation began to calm.

The Eight Great Families immediately issued a call to arms to the entire realm, demanding all noble clans send reinforcements to Zhongdu to resist the Evil Land invasion.

This was their second call; three months prior, they had already issued one as Evil Land first invaded.

Yet few responded.

For centuries the Eight Great Families had been overly domineering externally, and Evil Land’s ferocity scared all clans.

No one dared risk their elite troops under the control of the Eight Great Families, for if reinforcements were sent, those elites would surely be treated as cannon fodder—and likely sacrificed entirely.

At that point, the family would be doomed.

Because of these fears, the Eight Great Families received scant support or rescue during Zhongdu’s crisis, leaving many to sigh in helplessness.
