## Chapter 2289 — I’ll Make You Cry in a Moment

Yang Kai had just broken through the blazing sea of fire when several bolts of lightning crackled down from the sky, striking his body and making him tremble all over, the scent of charred flesh wafting from him.

The power of this lightning was immense. If not for Yang Kai’s extraordinary physique and his use of the Undying Five Elements Sword secret technique, he would likely have fainted on the spot. Even so, he was far from comfortable, feeling his entire body’s Origin Qi obstructed, its flow sluggish.

"Spring Wind... Turns to Rain!" The Wind character cultivator had appeared beside Yang Kai like a specter at some unknown moment. As the Blood Saber swept out, it stirred a gentle breeze that brushed across the face, enveloping Yang Kai within it. That breeze felt soothing, yet hidden within it was a strange power—one that seemed to lull the mind, urging surrender and sleep. As the wind seeped into Yang Kai’s body, his eyes briefly glazed over with confusion.

At the critical moment, he bit the tip of his tongue hard. Spatial Law swirled around him, and in a flick of his fingers, several massive Moon Blades slashed out in all directions.

“Dodge!” The Wind character martial artist’s expression changed, and he shouted in a low voice.

The Thunder and Fire character martial artists seemed to know Yang Kai’s methods. Seeing this spatial secret technique, their faces grew grave, and they quickly used their movement skills to evade.

Crash...

With a soft sound, a pair of illusory, ethereal wings of spiritual energy suddenly appeared behind Yang Kai. Wind and thunder power coiled around those wings, causing his speed to soar.

Wind-and-Thunder Wings!

Yang Kai hadn’t used this thing in a very long time. As his strength grew and his mastery of Spatial Law deepened, the Wind-and-Thunder Wings had become less and less useful.

But now, with this world suppressed by the Mountain character martial artist, Yang Kai couldn’t teleport at all. He could only use the Wind-and-Thunder Wings to slightly boost his speed.

Wind swirled, thunder surged. The appearance of these spiritual wings stunned both the Wind and Thunder character martial artists—they hadn’t expected Yang Kai to wield both wind and thunder powers. Counting the five elements’ power in his body and his own spatial force, the Blood Saber group was shocked by the sheer variety of powers Yang Kai commanded.

Whoosh...

Empowered by the Wind-and-Thunder Wings, Yang Kai’s speed increased again. In a flash, he appeared before the Fire character martial artist, his face almost pressed against the other’s.

The Fire character martial artist was startled, and as their eyes met, he saw ridicule and killing intent in Yang Kai’s gaze. Enraged and embarrassed, he roared, “Why are you staring at me?!”

“You always pick the softest persimmon!” Yang Kai chuckled darkly.

The Fire character martial artist’s face changed, and he growled, “You mean I’m the easiest to deal with?”

“Who knows!” Yang Kai grinned.

The reason he targeted the Fire character martial artist first was simple: the man was the easiest to handle.

As for the Mountain character martial artist, he was clearly focused on defense. With the four’s powers resonating together, Yang Kai figured he couldn’t break through that defense quickly. The Wind and Thunder character martial artists were both extremely fast. Only the Fire character martial artist was the softest persimmon among them.

As he spoke, Yang Kai pointed forward and shouted, “Freeze!”

Spatial Law stirred. Though affected by the Mountain character martial artist’s technique, it still caused the Fire character martial artist’s body to stiffen.

In a clash between experts, life and death are decided in an instant.

In that instant of stiffness, the Fire character martial artist felt the call of death and turned pale.

“Slash!” Yang Kai roared, bringing down the Myriad Sword in his hand.

The Fire character martial artist had no time to defend. The sword’s edge was already at his face.

At the critical moment, the Mountain character martial artist’s eyes snapped open. He formed a hand seal.

Suddenly, the phantom of a mountain appeared between Yang Kai and the Fire character martial artist, solidifying into something almost real. The Myriad Sword struck the mountain, producing a piercing sound. The mountain shattered, but it had absorbed all the force of Yang Kai’s attack.

The Mountain character martial artist merely swayed, then closed his eyes again, sitting motionless.

The Fire Ghost escaped death by a hair’s breadth, sweat pouring down his forehead. In a flash, he darted away.

At the same time, the Thunder and Wind character martial artists attacked together. After a brief exchange, they realized Yang Kai was no ordinary foe. Exchanging glances, they simultaneously activated their Origin Qi, formed hand seals, and with a sweep of their long blades, wind and thunder combined into a storm, surging toward Yang Kai.

In an instant, Yang Kai was in grave danger. His clothes were shredded by sharp wind blades, revealing his muscular body. Lightning crackled across his skin, making every step a struggle as he fought desperately to resist.

From afar, the Mountain character martial artist struck again, sending another phantom mountain crashing down, as if to pin Yang Kai in place forever.

With a thunderous boom, the mountain phantom landed. Yang Kai’s body sank, and the ground beneath his feet split open, spiderweb cracks spreading everywhere.

He suddenly raised both hands, holding the mountain aloft above him.

For the first time, a flicker of shock appeared in the Mountain character martial artist’s usually calm eyes.

The other three also grew solemn. After this round of fighting, none dared approach Yang Kai, only watching from a distance.

“Is this guy... even human?” The Fire Ghost, still shaken, stared wide-eyed ahead. “He actually held up Mountain Ghost’s Sumeru Peak with his body! That Sumeru Peak weighs a hundred thousand jin. Even most Emperor Realm cultivators couldn’t lift it, let alone with its suppressive power.”

“His body is incredibly strong!” the Wind character martial artist said enviously.

The Thunder character martial artist sighed, “Now I understand why the higher-ups want us to capture him alive. This man... is truly worth studying. He’s only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet has such strength. If we could uncover his secrets, we’d all benefit greatly.”

At these words, the Wind character martial artist and the Fire Ghost’s eyes lit up, as if seeing a bright future.

“But this is as far as he goes.” The Thunder character martial artist snorted coldly. “No matter how he resists, he’ll be crushed by Mountain Ghost’s Sumeru Peak.”

The Wind character martial artist and the Fire Ghost both nodded, clearly aware of the Sumeru Peak’s power.

“Heh heh heh heh...”

Just then, a cold laugh suddenly came from Yang Kai’s mouth.

After being besieged by these four, he was in a wretched state, yet he still grinned fiercely.

The Fire Ghost shouted, “Keep laughing, brat! I’ll make you cry in a moment!”

“If this is all you’ve got, I’m afraid the ones crying will be you!” Yang Kai glanced at the Fire Ghost, speaking blandly.

“What?” The Fire Ghost was stunned.

The Wind character martial artist’s face changed. He shouted, “Not good, attack now! This brat still has a trump card!”

As soon as he finished, he charged first, wind power swirling around him, Law Power spreading out.

“Dragon Transformation!” Yang Kai roared before the man could reach him.

A high, resounding dragon roar echoed. With it, a golden giant shadow appeared behind Yang Kai, coiling and twisting, and in the blink of an eye, it became a dazzling golden dragon, hovering above his head, its eyes glaring in all directions.

The Wind character martial artist, charging forward, froze, involuntarily sucking in a breath. He wavered and drifted back.

“This is...” The Thunder character martial artist’s eyes trembled.

“Dragon Might!” The Fire character martial artist’s eyes also widened as he shouted hysterically.

All three looked as if they’d seen a ghost in broad daylight, the world spinning, their feet cramping.

Ye Qinghan’s expression was no better. Seeing Yang Kai pinned beneath the Sumeru Peak, she’d wanted to help, but before she could move, everything changed.

In an instant, Dragon Might filled the field. That pure True Dragon aura spread, enough to make all living things bow. In the depths of every Blood Saber member’s heart, a shadow and fear took root.

Crackle crackle...

A sound rang out as dragon scales grew all over Yang Kai’s arms and the exposed skin of his body. The giant dragon shadow flashed and vanished, diving into Yang Kai’s body. In its place, Yang Kai had taken on a half-dragon form.

His already formidable aura soared, nearly reaching the level of the Emperor Realm!

His expression cold, he slowly clenched one fist while holding the Sumeru Peak aloft with the other, no longer struggling as before, as if it were nothing at all.

Then, he suddenly punched upward, striking the base of the Sumeru Peak.

With a thunderous boom, the hundred-thousand-jin Sumeru Peak flashed with light, blasted skyward by a surge of power.

Mountain Ghost’s face changed dramatically. He nearly bit through his tongue, and with a hand seal, turned the Sumeru Peak into light and recalled it.

“You’re finished!” With the Sumeru Peak gone, Yang Kai was completely free. He rolled his neck and grinned menacingly at the three Blood Saber members.

“Let’s go all out!” the Wind character martial artist shouted, “Wind Blade, Frost Sword!”

He urged his Origin Qi, all his power turning into a massive blade and sword, seemingly able to cleave the world, slashing at Yang Kai.

At the same time, the Fire Ghost and Thunder character martial artist unleashed their ultimate moves, attacking Yang Kai together.

The Wind, Thunder, Fire, and Mountain group’s combined technique could draw on each other’s power, amplifying their strength to the utmost.

They truly had the qualifications to fight ordinary Emperor Realm cultivators.

But today, they witnessed a scene that made their eyes nearly pop out.

Facing the trio’s desperate attacks, Yang Kai charged straight in, meeting their assault head-on.

With two cracking sounds, the three watched as Yang Kai shattered the Wind Blade and Frost Sword with his fists, then, without slowing, plunged into the eye of the storm and the vortex of thunder.

In just a few breaths, the trio’s techniques were all broken by brute force.

In a flash, the half-dragon Yang Kai appeared before the three; one hand had transformed into a dragon claw—incomparably sharp and able to rival the finest Secret Treasures—and it reached straight for the Wind character martial artist’s chest.
