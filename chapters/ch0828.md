## Chapter 828 — Tearing Space

The Qingluan Mountains were alive with birdsong and blossoms; the scenery was pleasant, a scene of peaceful harmony.

In a natural stone cave within the mountain, Yang Kai sat cross‑legged. A ribbon of memory‑light flowed through his mind, and his Divine Sense absorbed each scene and figure as if he had lived them.

That strand of memory‑light had been transmitted by Wu Jie—the account of the fortune he once obtained.

After shaking off Zhang Ao and the others, Yang Kai didn’t rush back to Tianxiao Sect. Instead he found a nearby place and began studying the method that could rend space.

He was very interested in it.

If he could truly master it, then in future, even faced with an overwhelming enemy, he could slip away with ease.

But from Wu Jie’s warning before leaving, the technique carried enormous risk.

With his mind steady, the memory‑light unfolded scene after scene before Yang Kai, vivid and clear.

In only a day or two, Yang Kai had divined it all.

He laughed silently—no wonder Wu Jie had so freely shared that story. The limitations on use were vast.

He had suspected Wu Jie of ulterior motives, but once he understood, he realized Wu Jie had nothing to gain by deceiving him; revealing the method posed no harm.

The method was wondrous and yet utterly simple.

It was like a Martial Skill and like a Soul Technique; using it consumed both True Yuan and Divine Sense, and the cost was staggering.

Even someone as strong as Wu Jie would be spent for a long while after using it.

Yang Kai was only at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm; Wu Jie thought that even if he comprehended it, he could not employ it for some time.

He had been mistaken. Yang Kai’s True Yuan and Divine Sense were far greater than Wu Jie had presumed—ample to support the technique.

The greater the expenditure of True Yuan and Divine Sense, the farther the space torn could reach.

Yang Kai sank into contemplation, quietly feeling out the art.

Rumor had it that the Void Passages and Small Xuan Realms on the Continent were created in ancient war by titanic experts.

The rumor might not be accurate, but Yang Kai realized how vast their powers must have been.

For them, tearing space or fabricating domains may not have been difficult.

Over the ages, martial ways declined and such arts ceased to be passed down.

Perhaps the top masters at Third Stage of the Saint Realm today could teleport tens of Li, but they could not rend space to leap a thousand Li at a breath.

Only Void Passages could do that.

Time flowed; after about half a month in the cave, Yang Kai felt he had digested the technique and grew eager to try.

Despite Wu Jie’s admonition, having obtained the art, Yang Kai could not let it sit unused.

He had to test it himself to know whether he truly could tear space—or whether Wu Jie had exaggerated.

Otherwise, should his life later depend on it, it might be too late.

Long in thought, Yang Kai finally rose.

True Yuan surged, Divine Sense flared, and the two forces merged. Subtle interactions occurred between them as he struck at the void.

Ripples rose before him like stones thrown into a still lake.

The ripples spread as Yang Kai continued to pour True Yuan and Divine Sense into them, his mind tracing along the waves for a seam.

After a long while, a flash of brightness appeared. In that calm well of spirit, he noticed the space in front of him was different.

When he sought to probe more closely, the trace vanished.

He drew a breath, restrained the outward flow of True Yuan and Divine Sense, and rested.

Though he had understood the method, practice revealed difficulties he hadn’t foreseen.

He could hardly fathom how ancient titans had produced Void Passages and Small Xuan Realms—often as a byproduct of battle.

Compared to them, he felt as small as an ant.

Half a day later, after restoring his energy, Yang Kai tried again.

True Yuan and Divine Sense surged; the ripples sought a rupture in the space’s weave.

This time his feeling was clearer and his spirit stirred with hope.

Gradually the world before him warped, the space folding like a translucent cloth.

At the folds, peculiar auras seeped into view.

Yang Kai’s spirit leapt. With no hesitation he struck the fold with a precise blow of True Yuan and Divine Sense.

Crack—

As if a massive gate opened, a black fissure yawned before him. Beyond it lay nothing—an abyss of void—and he could not tell what dangers lurked on the other side.

The mountain’s Spiritual Qi went awry. The rift sucked in Heaven‑and‑Earth Energy with terrifying force, whipping up a violent gale.

As energy rushed in, the rift snapped shut.

Before Yang Kai could examine it, a dark glimmer flashed and the fissure vanished; the warped space smoothed and the view cleared.

He frowned.

He knew he had only done half the work. If the fissure could be widened further, he could step through and see.

Feeling his state, he was astonished.

Several to four drops of Yang Liquid were gone from his Dantian; his Sea of Consciousness had lost about half of its energy.

He swallowed the shock. The cost of such a technique was horrific.

Even at his peak, he could only perform the art twice before his Divine Sense ran dry.

No wonder Wu Jie had looked spent when he appeared—using it was a dreadful strain even for him.

He quickly took a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye and several pills to restore Divine Sense; his energies recovered swiftly.

An hour later he was active again.

…

Failures and experiments accumulated priceless experience.

Three days later Yang Kai opened his eyes, full of vigor and confidence.

He believed this attempt would succeed.

True Yuan and Divine Sense flowed smoothly, not frenzied like his first try. The ripples advanced methodically; the space folded again at the chosen seam.

Yang Kai unleashed his power in an instant.

The black fissure reappeared, pulled as if by invisible hands, swelling wide.

The crack became a maw, ravenously devouring Heaven‑and‑Earth Energy.

Without hesitation Yang Kai plunged into the rift.

The fissure snapped closed behind him.

A familiar vertigo hit him. Yang Kai’s spirit brightened—not terrified but thrilled.

As he expected, the rift he made was essentially the mouth of a Void Passage; the sensations were strikingly similar.

Entering a Void Passage brings a brief dizziness before arriving elsewhere.

This time the dizziness did not end. Yang Kai felt as if he were falling down a bottomless abyss, endlessly plunging.

Chaotic streams of void surged around, laced with dreadful destructive power.

Yang Kai braced himself, maneuvering his spirit to avoid the currents and prevent injury.

These void currents were beyond his present capacity; compared to starry‑force they were no weaker. Being swept in could doom him to be lost forever.

This was why Wu Jie had warned him to be cautious.

Wu Jie had likely suffered grievously the first time he used the technique, hence his lingering dread.

Yang Kai rode through as a lone boat in a stormy sea—perilous yet composed—dodging currents while probing their pattern.

He did not rush to escape. He wanted to fathom the secrets hiding in the chaos of the Void Passage.

He felt the mysteries lay within the seeming disorder of the currents.

If he could understand them, he could rend space at will without fear.

Time passed; Yang Kai’s mood remained steady as he divided his attention between evasion and study.

When the currents suddenly surged into violent chaos, Yang Kai’s face changed. He gathered True Yuan and Divine Sense and tore another rift to burst out.

His vision blurred, and he had already returned to the Tongxuan Continent. Before his eyes the world was bright and clear, the blazing sun hanging high in the sky. It seemed as though he stood above the clouds, with a vast expanse of cotton-like clouds beneath his feet, thick and weighty.  

The scenery was exceptionally beautiful, and Yang Kai felt his heart open in delight. He allowed himself to keep falling downward, only circulating his True Yuan to steady his figure when he was about to reach the ground.
