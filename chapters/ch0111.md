## Chapter 111 — Each Fights Alone

Less than an hour remained before dawn.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang stepped out from the concealed mountain crevice, tracking the flow of Yin energy within the valley.

The direction of the Yin energy’s flow was now easy to discern because the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was rapidly absorbing the valley’s spiritual energy, causing all the Yin energy within to fiercely converge toward a single point.

Such an extraordinary phenomenon would be noticeable to anyone present in the valley.

Yang Kai reckoned that the two men from the Blood Battle Gang would surely investigate as well, and when that happened, they would inevitably cross paths.

Having slain several masters of the Qi Movement Realm and Separation and Union Realm, the battle intent surging within Yang Kai had yet to subside. There remained a True Yuan Realm powerhouse in this valley, and as long as pressure persisted, Yang Kai’s indomitable spirit would continue to manifest, keeping both his mind and body taut.

What he did not know was how much strength this True Yuan Realm adversary still retained.

	After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the two gradually neared the source of the Yin energy convergence. There, a bright light hovered midair, drawing in the Yin energy as if swallowing it whole.

This was the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew Yang Kai had seen earlier.

Only now, it was vastly different from before.

Previously, it had been merely a glowing orb without any distinct shape. Now, it resembled a flower bud on the verge of blooming, with delicate petals clearly visible.

The two concealed their forms, standing about fifty zhang from the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.

Xia Ningshang whispered, “The Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew lies within that bud. It will only reveal itself once the flower blooms. Only then can it be harvested. Originally, I had set the Nine Yin Eight Lock Formation to counter it, but those people forced me to activate it prematurely. As long as they live, the eight chains of Yin energy cannot be recalled. This time, it all depends on you, Junior Brother. Your True Yang Yuan Qi is its bane. Without my formation, I can offer no assistance.”

“Won’t it try to escape?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Yes, so... the chances aren’t good.” Xia Ningshang’s tone wavered, as if reluctant to admit defeat.

“What if we kill them all? Then you can use the formation again, right?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

“Even so, what if they don’t come here?”

“They already have.” Yang Kai’s gaze hardened as he suddenly turned to look aside.

Wen Feichen’s loud laughter echoed through the valley. “Ha! Clever boy!”

Xia Ningshang’s delicate face turned cold as she looked toward the sound, seeing Wen Feichen and Long Hui approaching side by side. Both bore fiery gazes fixed on the injured Xia Ningshang.

One coveted the Heaven-Grade treasure she possessed, the other desired her beauty.

Yang Kai remained calm, standing shoulder to shoulder with Xia Ningshang.

Wen Feichen strolled to within twenty zhang of them, a smile playing on his lips. “I see you’re still alive. Looks like those useless fools couldn’t accomplish anything.”

Wen Feichen had been struggling to dispel the Yin energy chains invading his body, but to no avail. None of the subordinates he had sent in pursuit had returned with news. He and Long Hui had been anxiously waiting, but upon sensing the shift in Yin energy within the valley, they had followed the trail here.

Upon arrival, they immediately spotted Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang. Overjoyed, they made no effort to conceal themselves, brazenly striding forward.

With matters having reached this point, Wen Feichen had no intention of making peace. He let out a long howl, attempting to summon his men back.

Yet, after the howl, he noticed the youth opposite him wearing a mocking expression, utterly fearless.

Wen Feichen could not understand why the boy was so confident.

Yang Kai stepped forward, his face cold. “You can howl all you want, but no one is coming to help you!”

Wen Feichen’s expression flickered. “What happened to them?”

“They’re all dead! The dead cannot come to your aid.” Yang Kai laughed heartily.

Wen Feichen’s face darkened as he glanced at Xia Ningshang in surprise.

In his mind, only Xia Ningshang could have slain those Separation and Union Realm masters; Yang Kai alone lacked such ability.

A grave miscalculation. He had never expected this woman to still have the strength to fight. When he struck her several hours ago, he had felt she was utterly defenseless. How had she recovered so quickly?

“Even if they’re all dead, you won’t escape my grasp!” Wen Feichen snorted coldly, clearly unconcerned by their deaths.

Yang Kai stepped forward, True Yang Yuan Qi surging through him, blood boiling with boundless battle intent. Just as he prepared to strike Wen Feichen, a beautiful figure shot out from behind him, directly confronting Wen Feichen.

Xia Ningshang took the initiative, launching an attack that targeted both Wen Feichen and Long Hui.

She clearly intended to protect the injured Yang Kai by facing two opponents alone.

Her figure flickered as ten chilling Yin energy strikes flew forth—seven aimed at Wen Feichen, three at Long Hui—swift as lightning and imposing in force.

Wen Feichen laughed heartily. “This little girl’s killing intent is strong; this won’t be easy!”

He met her attacks with both palms, easily dispelling them. “Young Master Long, you take that brat. I’ll handle this little girl.”

“Very well.” Long Hui nodded, reminding, “Don’t damage her face.”

“Understood!” Wen Feichen smiled meaningfully, then immediately engaged Xia Ningshang in fierce combat.

Though Xia Ningshang had recovered about forty percent of her strength, she had been injured earlier. Now, she could only muster the power of a sixth or seventh stage Qi Movement Realm cultivator.

Wen Feichen was even weaker, barely reaching the second or third stage of Qi Movement Realm.

Yet their true realms differed. Xia Ningshang was at the peak of Separation and Union Realm, wielding Yuan Qi, while Wen Feichen was a True Yuan Realm cultivator, his power stemming from True Yuan.

True Yuan and Yuan Qi were fundamentally different; the former wielded far greater destructive power.

Moreover, Wen Feichen’s battle experience far surpassed Xia Ningshang’s. As a result, she found the fight challenging. Though she would not be swiftly defeated, it was unlikely she could overcome Wen Feichen by strength alone. At best, the contest would end in a stalemate.

Both were formidable, their battle fierce and intense, their movements swiftly covering over a hundred zhang.

Yang Kai paid little attention to Xia Ningshang’s fight, for he had his own opponent.

Casting a glance at Long Hui standing some ten zhang away, Yang Kai suddenly chuckled. “Young Master Long, is it?”

Long Hui sneered coldly. “Beg for mercy? It’s too late!”

“I have a few questions for you.”

Long Hui regarded Yang Kai with a mocking gaze, casually replying, “If these are your last wishes, I might just grant them!”
