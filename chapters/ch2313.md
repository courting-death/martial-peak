## Chapter 2313 — News of Ghost Ancestor and the Others

"Eldest Brother and the others were really imprisoned by that old dog?" Chai Hu asked angrily, his expression furious.

"Yes!" Chi Yue ground her silver teeth, a trace of gloom crossing her face. "It was all my fault. I trusted that old dog’s words and caused Eldest Brother and the others to be controlled."

"Despicable scoundrel!" Chai Hu cursed, suddenly spitting out a mouthful of blood. Though seriously wounded, the blood shot like an arrow toward Luo Jin. Luo Jin remained unmoving, merely using his strength to block it, his gaze deadly dark.

Yang Kai frowned and said, "Senior, the Eldest Brother you mentioned... who is he?"

Although he had a vague suspicion, he couldn't be sure and had to ask.

Chi Yue said, "Your Lingxiao Sect’s Grand Elder, Ghost Ancestor!"

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised his brows, delighted. "The Elder is here too?"

"Yes, but he's currently imprisoned somewhere in the City Lord's mansion. I don't know exactly where," Chi Yue sighed softly.

"What about the others? Are they here too?" Yang Kai asked anxiously.

Chi Yue said, "The Alliance Master and Chairman Ai Ou are both here."

Observing her expression, Yang Kai was slightly startled and asked, "Then... what about Lord Wudao?"

Back when they set out from Dark Star, there were six of them: besides Yang Kai and Chi Yue, there was Ai Ou, President of Hengluo Commerce Guild; Gu Cangyun, Alliance Master of the Sword Alliance; Ghost Ancestor, Grand Elder of Lingxiao Sect; and finally, Wudao, recognized as the strongest in the Star Domain at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Of those six, except for Yang Kai—who was only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm at the time—the remaining five were all at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, the pinnacle of combat strength in the Star Domain!

The six used the Star Emperor Token left by Yang Yan to open the Starlight Passage. After overcoming countless obstacles, they arrived in the Star Realm, but were ambushed in the passage; after a chaotic battle, they were separated.

Yang Kai had previously guessed that, apart from himself, the others were likely together. Now, hearing Chi Yue mention Ghost Ancestor, Ai Ou, and Gu Cangyun, he knew his guess was correct.

But she hadn’t said where Wudao was, which made Yang Kai uneasy.

Sure enough, upon hearing Yang Kai’s question, Chi Yue’s expression dimmed. She said, "Lord Wudao... he’s already gone!"

"What?" Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. He could hardly believe it.

Wudao had been recognized as the strongest Void King in the Star Domain, already at the peak of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, one step from advancing to the Dao Origin Realm. It was only because the laws of the Star Domain prevented it that he couldn’t advance.

Even Long Tianshang, Grand Elder of Hengluo Commerce Guild at the time, treated Wudao with utmost respect.

Chi Yue and the others also regarded him as the foremost expert.

But Yang Kai never expected that Wudao would actually die! For one of the strongest experts to die just like that was unbelievable.

"How did Lord Wudao die?" Yang Kai’s expression turned cold as he looked at Luo Jin. "Was it his doing?"

Although he hadn’t interacted much with Wudao—only meeting him when leaving the Star Domain and opening the Starlight Passage, sharing some hardships—he was still furious upon hearing the news.

There were only a few people who came from the same Star Domain. Now that one was already gone, Yang Kai felt a deep, inexplicable sorrow.

Chi Yue shook her head. "This matter has nothing to do with him. Lord Wudao... he failed to break through to the Dao Origin Realm and died under the tribulation of heaven and earth."

Yang Kai was stunned for a long while after hearing this, finally sighing, "It was fate."

He had thought that with Wudao’s cultivation and foundation, advancing to the Dao Origin Realm after arriving in the Star Realm shouldn’t have been a problem. Even if not certain, he should have had a good chance. But from what Chi Yue said, he died from failing the breakthrough.

If Chi Yue hadn’t said it herself, Yang Kai would never have believed it.

After all, Chi Yue had already advanced to the Dao Origin Realm. How could Wudao have failed?

All of this could only be attributed to fate, something no one could resist.

"What about Ghost Ancestor and the others?" Yang Kai asked again.

Chi Yue said, "When we last parted, everything was fine. They had all advanced to the Dao Origin Realm, but I don’t know how they are now."

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

At this moment, Chai Hu, who had been listening at the side, suddenly said, "Young Brother, you actually know my Eldest Brother and the others?"

Yang Kai smiled and said, "Your Eldest Brother is the Grand Elder of my Lingxiao Sect, and I am the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect. What do you think?"

Chai Hu was stunned, looking at Chi Yue. "Is he also...?"

Chi Yue nodded gently.

Chai Hu immediately became respectful, cupping his fists. "I truly apologize for my rudeness."

Chai Hu clearly knew that Chi Yue and the others had come from a lower Star Domain. Now, learning that Yang Kai was the same, and that he had risen to such a level in a short time, he couldn’t help but admire him greatly.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Brother Chai, there's no need to stand on ceremony." After a brief pause, as if suddenly recalling something, he turned to Chi Yue and asked, "By the way, Senior, do you know where Xiaoxiao is?"

"Xiaoxiao?" Chi Yue frowned. "You mean that stone... wasn’t it with you?"

Yang Kai’s heart sank. "I haven’t seen it at all."

"We haven’t seen it either. After arriving here, the few of us stayed together. Although we were separated for a time, we reunited after two days. We also looked for you, but never found you."

"So Xiaoxiao wasn’t with you." Yang Kai felt a wave of disappointment and deep concern.

When Chi Yue and the others arrived in the Star Domain, although their cultivation wasn’t high, they had each lived for a thousand or two thousand years and were adaptable, so survival wasn’t a problem. But Xiaoxiao was different. Its intelligence wasn’t high, and it was a special being. If discovered, it might be captured and studied. For years, Yang Kai had worried most about Xiaoxiao, but even after meeting Chi Yue, he still couldn’t learn its whereabouts.

Seeing his expression, Chi Yue comforted him, "You don’t need to worry too much. Xiaoxiao is special, but even if it’s captured, its life won’t be in danger. As long as you keep searching, you’ll find it one day."

Yang Kai nodded. "Let’s hope so."

The two didn’t lower their voices, so everyone around could hear them clearly.

But no one really knew what they were talking about—only that the two had reunited after a long separation and shared a deep bond.

Suddenly, Luo Jin smiled and said, "Since you all miss your old friends so much, how about this Lord lets you reunite with them?"

Chi Yue shouted angrily, "Old dog! If you know what’s good for you, let my Eldest Brother and the others go, or I’ll tear down your City Lord’s mansion!"

Luo Jin said, "Little Yue, you should restrain your temper. As a woman, being so hot-tempered is unbecoming."

Chi Yue sneered, "That depends on who I’m dealing with. For despicable scoundrels like you, do you expect me to be all smiles?"

Luo Jin snorted coldly. "This Lord can give you one chance. Obediently return to my side and I’ll let bygones be bygones. If you remain stubborn, don’t blame this Lord for being rude!"

Yang Kai laughed loudly. "I’d like to see how the City Lord plans to be rude. Are you relying on the seventy men you’ve secretly stationed around us?"

"Since you’ve noticed, there’s no need to say more. Do it!" Luo Jin shouted. As his words fell, more than a dozen figures suddenly leapt out from all directions, each possessing Dao Origin Realm cultivation. Suspended in midair, these martial artists wore solemn expressions, forming hand seals that changed rapidly.

As their hand seals changed, the Origin Qi within their bodies seemed to resonate with a peculiar sound.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. "A formation?"

He could tell at once they were using some kind of formation—like the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation, a secret technique where the martial artists themselves form the foundation.

As soon as he finished speaking, the dozen or so martial artists acted in unison, blasting power at each other in pairs, instantly connecting together to form a giant net visible to the naked eye, which swept toward Yang Kai and the others.

The net was made entirely of Origin Qi but had a powerful sealing effect. As it descended, it seemed capable of locking down the entire area.

Chai Hu and Chi Yue suddenly felt their shoulders sink, as if a great mountain pressed down on them. Their strength couldn't circulate, their meridians were blocked, and they could barely breathe.

Yang Kai fared a bit better, but he too staggered.

The net fell, catching Yang Kai and the others off guard and trapping them all inside.

"Young Master Yang!" Ye Qinghan’s face paled as she cried out in alarm. Du Xian’s expression was also grim, his mind racing.

Today, in front of everyone, he had helped Yang Kai and defied Luo Jin, openly breaking with the City Lord’s mansion. He had only obeyed Ye Qinghan’s wishes; otherwise he would never have been so reckless. Seeing Yang Kai captured made him realize how badly things had gone: if they couldn't escape today, they might never leave.

With this thought, he gritted his teeth and secretly sent a voice transmission to Ye Qinghan: "Ye'er, watch for my signal later. We’ll break out together."

Ye Qinghan shook her head. "We must rescue Young Master Yang."

Du Xian said, "That’s impossible. Once Luo Jin deals with Young Master Yang, we’re next. If we don’t leave now, it’ll be too late."

"If Young Master Yang can’t escape, neither can we. If we want to live, we have to save him."

Du Xian looked at her in astonishment. "You have that much faith in him? He’s only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!"

Ye Qinghan gave a bitter smile. "You’ll understand in the future. Some people, even if their cultivation isn’t high, can accomplish things others can’t. Besides, Young Master Yang is crucial to the future of my Chiyue Sect. Even if I die, I have to save him."

Du Xian’s expression kept changing. For a moment, he was at a loss. Seeing Ye Qinghan’s determination, he realized she was set on taking Yang Kai with her. But how could a few people from Chiyue Sect rescue someone in front of so many experts at the City Lord’s mansion? Besides, Yang Kai and the others were already trapped like fish in a barrel—rescuing them would be extremely difficult.

"Hahahaha!" Luo Jin burst into laughter when he saw Yang Kai and the others trapped by the formation, his face full of mockery. "Young people don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. Do you think my City Lord’s mansion is a place you can act recklessly?"

All the guests turned pale, realizing Luo Jin was trying to make an example out of them. He had lost a lot of face today, and if he couldn’t capture Yang Kai and the others, he’d never be able to stand firm in Tianhe City again.

Fortunately, his secret preparations were finally paying off. He felt elated, his eyes flashing with venomous hatred as he stared at Yang Kai, as if considering how to torment him to vent his anger.
