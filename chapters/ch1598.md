## Chapter 1598 — Domain Stone Mountain

A hundred li from the Blood Prison, in a high stone pavilion atop the peak, Luo Hai sat with his eyes closed, as if quietly perceiving something.

The other Void King Realm experts were all focused on his slightest motion.

They could not discern anything inside the Blood Prison; only Luo Hai, as a Star Lord, could peer into parts of it — and naturally, Luo Hai became the focal center of everyone's attention.

After a long moment, Luo Hai opened his eyes, a faint smile appearing on his face.

"Lord Luo Hai, have you found something? Why are you so joyful?" the elderly woman of the Sword Alliance hurriedly asked.

"Good news, good news!" Luo Hai nodded slightly.

"Good news?" The beautiful woman of Purple Star lifted an elegant brow, regarding Luo Hai thoughtfully with a look of dawning comprehension. "Brother Luo Hai, are you saying that..."

"Heh heh, that's right — there is only one kind of good fortune within the Blood Prison, and it's exactly what you're thinking." Luo Hai nodded, then said in a deep voice, "The Domain Stone Mountain has appeared!"

"The Domain Stone Mountain has appeared?" Everyone reacted in unison.

"Indeed."

"This truly is a monumental blessing!" the elderly woman cried, her face creasing with delight. "Those youngsters who entered the Blood Prison this time are truly fortunate to encounter such good fortune — it seems they're luckier than most."

"Senior Sister Lei, why envy others? Two thousand years ago when you entered the Blood Prison, didn't you encounter this very blessing?" the beautiful woman said, pursing her lips in a smile.

"Heh heh, indeed — in the blink of an eye two thousand years have passed." A wistful expression crossed the elder's face. "Had I not encountered the Domain Stone Mountain back then, I likely would never have been able to glimpse the mysteries of Domain and thus would not have ascended to the Void King Realm. One could say the Domain Stone Mountain is the very foundation of my present realm."

"Senior Sister Lei encountered the Domain Stone Mountain?" many showed astonished faces; someone shouted, "Why didn't I have such luck? When I entered the Blood Prison back then, the Domain Stone Mountain was shrouded by an extraordinarily powerful domain field, and it was impossible to get a glimpse."

"That's just luck," Luo Hai chuckled. "The Domain Stone Mountain is the Blood Prison's treasure; it is extraordinarily solid. Even Void King Realm cultivators cannot necessarily harm it in the slightest. It is immense; no one can carry it away. It is the best place for Origin Returning Realm practitioners to contemplate the secrets of Domain. Unfortunately it is shrouded for years by ferocious domain fields, and only very rarely do those fields weaken and reveal the true face of the Domain Stone Mountain. And the Blood Prison opens only once every thousand years. When it opens, the Domain Stone Mountain may still not appear — it's normal that you didn't encounter it. Don't envy Senior Sister Lei's fortune. Aren't you all Void King Realm now anyway?"

"All that said, if I had met the Domain Stone Mountain back then, I wouldn't have had to toil three hundred years to break through to my current realm." After speaking, he was filled with regret, his face full of resentment as he sighed at his lack of luck compared to Elder Lei.

The elder chuckled, "Why the long sighs? I was simply lucky to encounter the Domain Stone Mountain. Since ascending to the Void King Realm, I have made no further progress. I'm afraid I'll be stuck at this level for the rest of my life."

“Senior Sister Lei, there’s no need to belittle yourself. Who can say what the future holds in cultivation? Perhaps one day fortune will smile upon you, and you’ll break through to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm,” the beautiful woman consoled gently.

Though the major powers within the Star Domain often clashed, as Void King Realm experts they nevertheless shared some camaraderie, so a casual word of comfort was hardly out of place.

"Let's hope so," the elder forced a smile, then furrowed her brow, her face clouding with concern. "Though the appearance of the Domain Stone Mountain is joyous, the trials the youngsters will face will likely be far harsher. When I scrambled for a favorable spot I fought a life-and-death battle and nearly perished. This time they too may see many deaths."

"Whether it's blessing or disaster depends on their own fortunes. Our worrying here will do no good," the elderly man of the Hengluo Commerce Guild said, slowly shaking his head.

"True enough. By the way, Lord Luo Hai, that lad who is at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—how is he faring now? Is he dead or alive?" the elder suddenly remembered Yang Kai and asked.

All eyes turned to Luo Hai; it was plain they were all very interested in Yang Kai.

Luo Hai smiled faintly. "He's still alive — I can sense his life force."

"He's alive!" the elder cried in delight. "Excellent — I was truly afraid his fortune would fail and he'd be killed by that powerful fellow. It seems his luck is better than mine. I eagerly await the day he walks out of the Blood Prison; I'll have to see whether the boy really has three heads and six arms."

"He certainly doesn't have three heads and six arms, just a lot of nerve. He..." Luo Hai began, then fell silent, frowning as he sensed something; soon amazement spread across his face.

"Lord Luo Hai, he hasn't run into trouble, has he?" the Purple Star beauty asked anxiously.

No one wished to see Yang Kai fall or be beset by trouble. They all regarded him as a rising talent for their respective factions and intended to offer him exceedingly generous terms the moment he left the Blood Prison, to recruit him.

"He hasn't met any trouble — yet — but I get the impression he's about to bring trouble upon himself!" Luo Hai said in an odd tone.

"What do you mean?" the elder asked nervously.

"He actually headed in the direction of the Domain Stone Mountain!" Luo Hai's face was utterly strange.

"Ah?" Everyone gasped in alarm.

"How could he head toward the Domain Stone Mountain?" the elder scolded as if furious with him. "The brat's practically seeking death! That place is no place for him. If he gets caught up in some dispute..."

"Ah, the boy is truly more trouble than he's worth," the Purple Star beauty sighed, helpless.

Yang Kai was trapped inside the Blood Prison; they could not interfere and could only watch as he walked into peril.

One by one the Void King Realm experts wished they could storm into the Blood Prison right now, drag Yang Kai out, and give him a harsh lesson.

"This just keeps getting more interesting — the lad really does have guts," Luo Hai said with a light laugh.

"Lord Luo Hai, please, keep a closer eye on that boy and see whether he will..." the elder requested anxiously.

"Very well. While I cannot probe too closely, I can sense his life force. If any change occurs, I will inform you," Luo Hai nodded, not refusing the request.

He himself was also quite interested in Yang Kai.

"Then we'll trouble Lord Luo Hai with this," they said.

...

Within the Blood Prison, at a certain spot, there stood a small hill.

Calling it a hill was generous — it was little more than a slightly larger mound.

No higher than thirty zhang and covering only a few dozen zhang across, the little hill gave off a peculiar sheen; a gentle domain field seeped from within and radiated outward.

Domain Stone Mountain! The treasure of the Blood Prison!

Its true form was simply a gigantic Domain Stone; no one knew how it had come into being, but since its birth it had remained within the Blood Prison.

It had long been shrouded by immensely terrifying domain fields; no one could penetrate them to glimpse the true face of the Domain Stone Mountain.

The domain field encircling the Domain Stone Mountain was acknowledged as the most formidable within the Blood Prison. No Origin Returning Realm warrior dared challenge it — those who had tried had met untimely deaths.

Although it was long cloaked by a powerful field, that field did wane at times — and only then would the Domain Stone Mountain be exposed and visible.

There was no rule to it, but in past openings perhaps once in ten the Domain Stone Mountain would reveal itself. Whenever that happened, every Origin Returning Realm practitioner who heard the news would converge beneath it like cats scenting blood, gathering from every direction to find a suitable spot and absorb the mountain's miraculous emanations.

It was far safer — and far more effective — than plunging into a Domain vortex. The wonder emanating from the Domain Stone Mountain could be easily drawn upon by cultivators, allowing them to glimpse the mysteries of Domain.

Some cultivators who otherwise had no hope of breaking into the Void King Realm managed to do so because they encountered the Domain Stone Mountain.

Senior Sister Lei of the Sword Alliance was one such case.

Over the millennia, though the Domain Stone Mountain appeared only a handful of times, that did nothing to dampen the fervor with which cultivators pursued it.

At this moment, over a hundred Third Stage Origin Returning Realm experts had gathered around the Domain Stone Mountain. They came from all corners of the Star Domain, grouping in threes and fives or in bands of seven or eight, occupying various positions.

There were eight or nine distinct factions, clearly delineated.

Among them the largest groups occupied the prime positions, each displaying their aura and the secret treasures in their hands glittering as they cast cold glances about.

No one dared provoke them — not only because they were numerous, but because their backgrounds were significant.

The remaining factions, ranked by strength, likewise took up different positions.

Nearly a hundred people had almost entirely besieged the Domain Stone Mountain. Though a few vacant spots remained, a steady stream of cultivators kept arriving from all directions upon hearing the news.

It was easy to imagine that any remaining space would soon be taken by arriving cultivators.

Those who arrived late and failed to secure good ground would inevitably challenge the weaker groups and forcefully seize advantageous spots.

On a middling patch to the left of the Domain Stone Mountain, three Third Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivators had gathered.

Of the three, two were known to Yang Kai: Qian Tong and the beautiful Lin Yurao from Star Emperor Mountain; the third was someone Yang Kai had never met.

At this moment the three were quietly circulating their Saint Yuan, their most powerful secret treasures already grasped in hand as they vigilantly scanned the surroundings.

Having arrived relatively early, their position was acceptable — but as more cultivators poured in, hostile eyes began to appraise them, as if weighing whether to strike and drive the three away.

Were it not for the three projecting sufficient strength, they would certainly not be able to hold their ground.

Yet remaining on such constant guard was no solution — with the Domain Stone Mountain now exposed, the powerful, numerous factions had already begun contemplating the mysteries of Domain, and the three would gain nothing by dawdling.

The three wished to delve into comprehension, but dared not let down their guard — how vexing it was.
