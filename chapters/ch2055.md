## Chapter 2055 — Eager to Seek Death

When the name Ghost-Hand Shentu was shouted out, the faces of the Qin Family's warriors drained of color; without a word they all hastily activated their powers, ready to strike at any moment.

A flicker of panic crossed the violet-clad girl's beautiful eyes.

Although young, her knowledge and experience were surprisingly deep; besides, among the warriors near Fenglin City there were few who did not know the name Ghost-Hand Shentu.

That man was a cultivator at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Though no one knew what evil art he had cultivated, he was extremely vicious and ruthless, spending years committing crimes around Fenglin City and, relying on his Dao Origin Realm might, ambushing and robbing those far weaker than himself.

To many warriors, the name Ghost-Hand Shentu was synonymous with disaster—running into him meant death was not far off.

He was not alone either; he had somehow gathered a band of capable subordinates, each possessing Void King Realm cultivation—ordinary people who met them stood no chance and could only be slaughtered.

He was not only vicious but also extremely crafty. The City Lord's Mansion, led by City Lord Duan Yuanshan, had repeatedly dispatched experts to encircle and hunt him, but none succeeded; the only opportunity they had once gained left him grievously wounded, yet he still managed to escape.

After that, Ghost-Hand Shentu seemed to lie low for a time, but those in the know understood he had merely stopped acting recklessly; now he targeted only those without backgrounds or backing, and never provoked the families of Fenglin City or the surrounding Sect disciples.

Thus the heavy-hitters of the families and sects grew tired and stopped bothering with him. The City Lord’s Mansion could not sustain an endless hunt, and with the man sly as a fox, he had been able to run free until now.

By coincidence, the place Yang Kai had chosen to ascend was not far from where Shentu and his men gathered, so any stirrings there were readily discovered.

Knowing Yang Kai had no backing and was at a breakthrough threshold, this group would not let him be; naturally, they moved out together, ready to put on a show.

They had, however, run into a group from the Qin Family here.

Hearing the middle-aged man's startled shout, the bald old man sneered coldly, "Since you know this old man's name and still dare come, are you looking for death?"

As he spoke, the Void King Realm cultivators at his side all looked ominous, as if at his command they would fall upon them.

The middle-aged man's expression changed slightly; he swallowed hard and for a moment did not know how to answer.

After a brief pause the violet-clad girl recovered her composure, pursed her lips in a smile and said softly, "So it is the renowned Senior Shentu. I, blind and foolish, collided with you—please do not take offense!"

"Oh?" Shentu narrowed his triangular eyes and eyed the violet-clad girl, chuckling strangely, "To remain so calm before me—little miss, you have some nerve; which family are you from?"

Shentu had spent years skulking around Fenglin City; he could tell at a glance the girl had some backing, otherwise she would not have responded so fittingly. If not for that reason, he would not have bothered to chat with her—given his nature, he would have long ago opened slaughter.

"My surname is Qin!" the girl replied softly.

Shentu's mouth curled, and he said lightly, "Qin, eh. I heard that within the Qin Family there was a little girl named Qin Yu who suffered illness since youth but was clever and lively, and that old Qin Chaoyang favored her so much he once ventured into the depths of the Black Blood Swamp to fetch a Kaiyang Fruit to extend her life—could that be you?"

The violet-clad girl coughed lightly and nodded, "You have a discerning eye; I am indeed Qin Yu. By the ancestor's mercy I have barely survived until now."

Shentu laughed oddly, "Little girl, you truly are remarkable to face me without losing your color—no wonder that old dog Qin Chaoyang favors you. But… what do you want with me?"

Qin Yu's brows furrowed. After a moment she said, "Since you ask, I'll say it plainly—are you here to seek trouble with that person?"

Shentu's eyes narrowed; he said coolly, "And if I am?"

Qin Yu asked, "Could you spare that person?"

Shentu curled his lip, "Give me a reason."

"That person is an honored guest of my Qin Family, so…" Qin Yu answered in a low voice, "please show mercy, and my Qin Family will come to express our thanks another day."

Shentu grinned with an amused expression, "Little girl, you are clever, but don't take others for fools! If he truly were your Qin Family's honored guest, why would he choose a place like this to breakthrough? If he were your honored guest, wouldn't old Qin Chaoyang personally guard him? Do you really think I'm so easily fooled?"

Qin Yu showed no embarrassment at being seen through and smiled, "You have keen sight; my little ruse truly couldn't fool you. But… even if he isn't my Qin Family's honored guest now, that doesn't mean he won't be in the future. Could you please show mercy…"

Before her words finished, Shentu raised a hand and interrupted her.

Shentu fixed her with a cold stare, his triangular eyes radiating frost. "Little miss," he said, "for Qin Chaoyang's sake I'll let this pass this time — but if you dare meddle again, don’t blame me or my men for being merciless."

As he spoke he swept his hand, and a massive force flew directly toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu's face changed; she hurriedly stepped back.

The Void King Realm cultivators who had been guarding her flashed forward to intercept, standing before her; with muffled groans several were thrown back a few steps before steadying themselves.

Looking ahead, Shentu had already led his group and flown away at speed.

The middle-aged man and the others were still pale with fright; they turned to Qin Yu and asked, "Miss, are you all right?"

Qin Yu shook her head. "Thanks to the guardians I am fine, but it's a pity about that person…"

Her gaze drifted to the distance and her expression dimmed.

The middle-aged man said, "Actually, there's nothing to pity—he probably couldn't survive the Heaven-and-Earth Energy baptism this time; dying a moment earlier or later makes no difference. Miss, you've done all you could. Next time you must not provoke someone like Ghost-Hand Shentu again; he spared us this once out of regard for the ancestor, but next time we may not be so lucky."

"I understand; it was I who dragged everyone into this," Qin Yu said, nodding slightly.

Far off, Yang Kai seemed completely unaware, still immersed in his comprehension of the Martial Dao and struggling against the shackles of breaking through the Dao Origin Realm.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Shentu led more than a dozen Void King Realm cultivators, who suddenly appeared beside Yang Kai.

Feeling the violent energy fluctuations here and looking up at the huge black funnel in the sky, even Shentu's face could not help but change.

He had also passed through this step in the past, but back then the commotion had been nothing like this; the current disturbance was perhaps ten times greater. Even if he faced such a Heaven-and-Earth Energy baptism now, he had little confidence of coming through unscathed.

"Master, this place is terrifying—let us strike quickly and leave," one of the Void King Realm cultivators nearby said, sweat beading on his forehead as he trembled, clearly suppressed by the might of the heavens and earth.

Everyone else showed strained expressions as well; the moment they stepped into this place they felt something wrong—the Power of the Laws swirling about was thick and chaotic, making the circulation of their own strength feel obscure and stifled.

Shentu nodded, glancing at Yang Kai who sat cross-legged as he said, "Kid, blame your bad luck for choosing to ascend here—be more careful in your next life."

With that he suddenly slapped his hand down.

Seeing his movement, the Void King Realm cultivators immediately unleashed beams of Martial Skill light toward Yang Kai.

But before those beams reached Yang Kai's body, an astonishing light suddenly manifested three zhang from his body, forming an oval that enveloped him entirely.

Boom, boom, boom...

All the attacks struck that luminous screen, sending out layers of ripples, yet none could cause the slightest damage.

Everyone was stunned at the sight.

At that moment Yang Kai slowly opened his tightly shut eyes; a cold look swept across them as he said calmly, "Why are there always people like you who, tired of living so long, are so eager to seek death?"

All the Void King Realm cultivators he fixed his gaze upon inexplicably felt a chill creep up their spines, as if something terrible was about to occur.

While they were distracted, Yang Kai raised a hand.

With a series of sizzling sounds, Moon Blades leisurely shot forth.

"Not good, dodge!" someone cried out.

But the Moon Blades were so fast they struck before the cultivators had time to react.

Although some instinctively raised protective powers, those protections were like paper before the Moon Blades and could not withstand them.

The dark Moon Blades sliced through, and muffled groans were heard.

No blood sprayed, yet the cultivators looking around were ashen with shock.

Crescent-shaped holes appeared at different parts of their companions' bodies; the wounds were clean and smooth, but the flesh that should have been there was gone, with no fragments of meat or bone—it was as if they had been banished into the void.

Through those eerie wounds, writhing innards could be seen.

The intense visual clash caused several cultivators to scream in terror.

Pfft pfft pfft...

Only then did the sound of blood spurting out come; in an instant several cultivators fell around Yang Kai, blood mixed with shredded entrails spraying forth—the scene was grotesquely gory.
