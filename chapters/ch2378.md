## Chapter 2378 — Rules

"This should be the place to rent a cave dwelling, right?" Yang Kai stood in front of a grand hall at the border between the outer and inner city, looked up for a moment, then called out to Liu Qianyun and stepped inside.

He was able to find this place so quickly thanks to the directions from Ling Yinqin and the others. Originally, Jiao Yi wanted to personally accompany him, but Yang Kai politely refused. After all, Jiao Yi and the others had just returned from a long trip at sea and surely had their own matters to attend to. Besides, renting a cave dwelling wasn't a troublesome affair—Yang Kai was confident he could handle it himself.

Before parting, Jiao Yi gave Yang Kai a communication bead, telling him to reach out anytime if he needed help.

There weren’t too many cultivators coming and going inside the grand hall, but it wasn’t exactly empty either.

When Yang Kai arrived, there were already a few people waiting ahead of him, seemingly also here to rent cave dwellings. He stood quietly to the side and observed for a while, quickly grasping the rental procedure.

Half an hour later, when it was his turn, he stepped forward, tossed a pouch of Source Crystals onto the table, and said to the cultivator in charge, "Rent a medium cave dwelling, for one year."

"Outer city or inner city?" The cultivator glanced up at Yang Kai and asked indifferently.

Yang Kai snorted, "If I wanted an outer city cave dwelling, would I give you so many Source Crystals? Do you take me for an idiot?"

The person in charge wasn't annoyed, just grinned, picked up the pouch of Source Crystals and weighed it in his hand before putting it away. He pointed at the sand table to the side and said, "Pick one yourself."

The sand table looked like a scaled-down model of the entire Tongtian City, with every building rendered in vivid detail. There were two large areas for cave dwellings—one in the outer city, where prices were much lower, and one in the inner city, where rentals were more expensive. Most cave dwellings had small flags outside, indicating they were already rented, and only a few spots remained vacant.

Yang Kai just needed a place to stay, so he didn't care much about the grade of the Purification Array or the amount of Spiritual Qi inside. He swept his gaze over the sand table and pointed to a relatively secluded cave dwelling. "That one."

The person in charge glanced at it, then casually tossed a token to Yang Kai without even looking up. "This is the Restriction Token. Keep it safe. You are not to pass the cave dwelling on to others, nor are you to tamper with the Purification Array. Anyone caught doing so will be killed without mercy."

Yang Kai caught the token, gave it a quick inspection, then put it away and left with Liu Qianyun.

……

Another half hour later, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun arrived at the cave dwelling. The inner city's cave dwelling district was set among the island's mountain range, with cave dwellings of all sizes carved into the mountainside. The environment was quite decent overall.

The Spiritual Qi in the Jixu Secret Realm was always extremely dense, but it was mixed with endless transforming force, so cultivators couldn't absorb it directly. Only after setting up a Purification Array could they circulate their cultivation and absorb it. The efficiency of cultivation depended on the grade of the Purification Array.

Still, even with the highest-grade Purification Array, cultivators could only barely maintain their cultivation in this wretched place, let alone improve.

The medium cave dwelling Yang Kai rented naturally had a mid-grade Purification Array installed.

He and Liu Qianyun checked out the cave dwelling and found it was quite spacious, with three side rooms, an alchemy room, a refining room, and even a living room.

Compared to the cave dwelling Yang Kai once rented in Fenglin City, this place was much better, though the price was about the same.

In the Jixu Secret Realm, Source Crystals were extremely precious, so the same price represented a different value. The same amount of Source Crystals was worth much more here.

"Junior Sister, pick a room for yourself," Yang Kai said to Liu Qianyun.

"What about you?" Liu Qianyun asked.

"I'm going to get familiar with the area and find that artificer to repair Ling Yinqin's Purification Array."

Liu Qianyun said, "Then Senior Brother, be careful."

"Got it. If you have nothing to do, you can reinforce the various restrictions in the cave dwelling. We might be staying here for quite a while."

"Mm, go and come back soon," Liu Qianyun said softly. After speaking, her face flushed, because she suddenly felt that she and Yang Kai seemed like a married couple living together—her husband going out while the wife worried and reminded him, and she was playing the wife's role.

As soon as this thought arose, her cheeks grew even hotter. When she looked up again, Yang Kai was already gone.

After winding through the streets of Tongtian City and asking for directions several times, Yang Kai finally arrived at a small alley.

He looked around, a strange expression on his face, and muttered, "Did I take the wrong way? Would an artificer live in a place like this?"

Earlier, when he parted ways with Jiao Yi and the others, Jiao Yi had given him a communication bead and secretly messaged him, telling Yang Kai that if he really wanted to repair Ling Yinqin's high-grade Purification Array, he should go to the inner city to find Master Sangde.

On the whole Tongtian Island, Master Sangde was the best artificer. It was said he had already touched upon the mysteries of becoming an Imperial-Grade Artifact Refiner, and at least eighty percent of the high-grade Purification Arrays on Tongtian Island were made by him.

Since this man could craft high-grade Purification Arrays, repairing one would be no problem.

Jiao Yi also knew how important the high-grade Purification Array was to Ling Yinqin, so he secretly gave Yang Kai some pointers, hoping the array could be repaired.

Yang Kai wasn't familiar with Tongtian City, but Master Sangde's reputation was huge, so he only had to ask a few people along the way to find this place.

Still, he couldn't believe that someone on the verge of becoming an Imperial-Grade Artifact Refiner would live in such a remote corner. Then again, some experts had eccentric tempers and acted unpredictably, so it wasn't too surprising.

He walked straight to the end of the alley and came to a large door, which stood open. Yang Kai glanced inside and saw a spacious courtyard, empty and spotless.

A boy dressed as a servant was sweeping the ground outside.

Yang Kai stepped forward, cupped his fists, and said, "Greetings, young brother."

The boy seemed deaf, completely ignoring Yang Kai and continuing to sweep as if Yang Kai weren't there.

Yang Kai coughed and asked, "Excuse me, is this where Master Sangde cultivates in seclusion?"

Only then did the boy look up, his face impatient. "Since you've already found this place, why bother asking?"

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately knew he was in the right place and quickly said, "Is Master available? I have something I'd like him to repair, I wonder if..."

"Who are you? Don't you know the rules?"

"Rules? What rules?" Yang Kai looked confused.

The boy sized up Yang Kai and sneered, "You came here without even asking about the rules? You're really something. You think you can see the master just like that? Maybe in your next life."

Yang Kai humbly asked, "Please, Young Brother, enlighten me."

The boy looked up at the sky, holding his broom, and quickly moved his fingers.

He wanted a bribe! Seeing the boy's posture, Yang Kai immediately understood this wasn't his first time doing this. No wonder people say the King of Hell is easy to see, but little devils are hard to deal with—this boy was a little devil through and through.

Suppressing his annoyance, Yang Kai took a cloth pouch from his Spatial Ring and handed it over. "Now will you tell me?"

The boy weighed the pouch, then smiled in satisfaction and began to explain loftily, "The master is very busy and doesn't have time to deal with you people. But he's kind-hearted and knows life on Tongtian Island isn't easy, so he makes time to help with artifact refining."

Yang Kai curled his lip at these words. The boy made it sound like he himself wasn't trapped on Tongtian Island—truly shameless.

"Remember this," the boy said solemnly. "Every month, the master opens his doors three times, giving three chances to help you refine Secret Treasures. If you want his help, it's all up to your luck. Of course, sometimes when he's in a good mood, he'll open the doors an extra time. Each time, he only helps the first ten people. If you come late, there's no chance."

"Three chances, ten spots each time?" Yang Kai frowned. Master Sangde really put on airs, making all these strange rules. But now he understood why there was no one here today—either it wasn't time for the doors to open, or they'd already opened.

"You're a quick learner, that's exactly it!" The boy nodded with a smile.

"How old are you, kid, daring to talk to adults like that!" Yang Kai's face darkened as he reached out to knock the boy on the head.

The boy shrank his head but didn't dodge. His cultivation was low, only at the Origin Returning Realm, so he couldn't avoid Yang Kai's blow.

"You... you dare hit me?" The boy staggered back a few steps, clutching his head and shouting, his eyes red with anger.

"That's nothing. If you keep being so rude, I'll really give you a beating."

The boy seemed frightened. Everyone who came here was always polite to him, not daring to offend him in the slightest. This was the first time someone had dared to teach him a lesson. In his panic, he glanced toward the courtyard, as if hoping Master Sangde would come out for him, but there was no movement inside at all.

"What are you looking at! Such a young age and already bullying others with your master's power. What will you be like when you grow up? I'm asking you a question—answer honestly!" Yang Kai snorted.

The boy looked unhappy but said nothing.

"How many times has the master opened the doors this month?" Yang Kai asked.

"Twice!" the boy snorted.

"When's the next time?"

"How would I know? The master opens the doors whenever he feels like it. Just wait!"
