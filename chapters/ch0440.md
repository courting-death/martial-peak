## Chapter 440 — The People Who Came Later

Young Master Huo’s words rang out with resounding strength, sharp and clear.

Everyone within the hall was momentarily stunned, their eyes flickering between him and Yang Kai, as if sensing something unusual in their relationship.

Lan Chudie and Luo Xiaoman, two buxom beauties, covered their mouths in shock, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. He knew that Huo Xingchen’s words were easily misunderstood, so he snorted lightly and said, “Be clearer.”

Huo Xingchen realized his mistake and gave an embarrassed laugh. “Don’t get the wrong idea. Yesterday, I made a bet with Brother Kai to see if he could survive the night. My eyesight isn’t good enough, so I lost the bet.”

“What was the wager?” Qiu Yimeng suddenly became interested, as she truly didn’t know about the bet between Yang Kai and Huo Xingchen.

“If I lost, I had to hand over the Golden Feather Eagle to him,” Yang Kai said with a grin. “But if he lost… heh heh! Young Master Huo would have to strip bare and run ten laps through War City!”

A burst of laughter erupted. Many women’s cheeks flushed at the thought of the young Huo running naked through War City—it was truly a comical image.

“A bet is a bet. There’s no need to say it out loud,” Huo Xingchen said sullenly, then his expression turned sour. “Yang Kai, you should choose. If you want these items, the bet is off. If you say no, I, Young Master Huo, will strip right now and fulfill the wager, but you’ll forget about the items and even about me—I’ll leave here at once!”

He waved his folding fan with an air of satisfaction. “I, Young Master Huo, have never broken a promise in a bet.”

His face was calm and confident, showing no sign of nervousness—he clearly believed that faced with such a temptation, Yang Kai would accept the experts and supplies he brought.

Compared to running naked ten laps in War City, those experts and supplies were much more valuable. Yang Kai would not be foolish.

Yang Kai chuckled smoothly. “Then I invite Young Master Huo to... unrobe.”

Huo Xingchen’s expression stiffened, his fan shaking frozen in his hand. He put on a forced grimace. “Brother Kai... don’t be like this. I haven’t offended you. Why be so merciless?”

Qiu Yimeng stifled a smile nearby.

Huo Xingchen quickly turned to her, bowing politely. “Qiu Yimeng, say a word for me. Why are you just watching the fun?”

Qiu Yimeng shook her head gravely. “I can’t help this man; you know that.”

Huo Xingchen had no choice and glanced around. Spotting Fat Dong sitting there, he hurried over and bowed deeply. “Brother Fat, you seem quite close to Yang Kai. Please say a good word for me…”

Dong Qinghan’s face darkened. He disliked being called ‘Brother Fat,’ but given the person he was dealing with, he could only smile wryly. “Young Master Huo, please forgive me. I’m just a humble man; this kind of pleading…” 

While he spoke, Fat Dong noticed that Huo Xingchen was shamelessly staring at Lan Chudie beside him, his eyes glowing wolfishly. This made the situation awkward, and he cleared his throat.

“Beautiful lady.” Huo Xingchen openly praised, then looked around again, suddenly noticing Luo Xiaoman, a true beauty of the mortal realm. The lust in his eyes intensified, and even the air from his nostrils seemed hot.

Luo Xiaoman timidly shrank away behind Fan Hong, terrified.

She had never met such a shameless rake—he practically wore “lecherous” on his sleeve, shameless beyond even Yang Kai!

“Yang Kai, are these people all your allies?” Huo Xingchen asked.

“Yes, all just arrived today.”

Huo Xingchen’s expression suddenly grew serious. He took several steps forward to Yang Kai, bowed solemnly, then spoke earnestly. “Brother Kai, about that bet—I admit my shortsightedness and judging you poorly. Please, don’t take it to heart. I’m just an irresponsible young master, not worthy to compare to you. Last night’s battle made me realize my mistakes. That’s why I rushed back to Zhongdu, begging my father for troops and supplies. From now on, I, Huo Xingchen, live for Brother Kai and die for Brother Kai. Only one thing I ask—you must keep me here!”

Then, without hesitation, he sat down heavily and muttered, “I’m staying here anyway. You can’t get rid of me.”

Qiu Yimeng shook her head with a sigh, looking at Yang Kai. “I think it’s better to send him away. If you let him stay, future female guests won’t feel at ease.”

Yang Kai nodded solemnly. “That’s what I mean.”

“Brother Kai, Miss Qiu, I admitted my fault. Why are you so hard on me?” Huo Xingchen nearly cried. Although he had been with countless women, few compared to Lan Chudie and Luo Xiaoman, whose allure rarely appeared except to those drawn by status and money.

“Enough.” Yang Kai frowned, tired of the nonsense. He waved his hand. “Have your men bring the supplies inside.”

He never intended to harm Huo Xingchen, nor expected him to bring people and supplies.

But a decadent scion like Huo Xingchen needed some discipline; otherwise, he’d never learn obedience. After this loss, Yang Kai guessed he would behave more cautiously in the future.

Hearing this, Huo Xingchen beamed and hurriedly rose, shouting to his subordinates: “What are you waiting for? Bring the things inside! Also, tell everyone to behave. Don’t think just because you’re from the Huo Family you’re important. Everyone here is a friend. Understand?”

“Yes!” The Huo Family men answered and hurried off carrying boxes.

The young Huo chuckled proudly, then quickly approached Luo Xiaoman, teasing, “What’s your honorable surname, beautiful lady?”

Luo Xiaoman was terrified and shyly stood up, pulling Qiu Yimeng’s sleeve. “Sister Qiu...”

A frail, helpless look, praying for shelter, stirred Huo Xingchen’s desire greatly.

Qiu Yimeng patted her hand and sneered coldly at Huo Xingchen, “If you dare to make a move on her, I’ll make sure you die without a grave!”

Huo Xingchen forced a laugh. “So you’re backing her? Don’t worry, I guarantee I won’t touch anyone under your protection!”

He then rushed over to Lan Chudie’s side, just as she smiled sweetly. “I’m Yang Kai’s Senior Sister!”

Huo Xingchen suddenly went speechless, deeply frustrated.

“Cut it out,” Qiu Yimeng scolded softly. “You’re lecherous but not that desperate. Besides, as a Huo Family young master, what beauty can’t you have? Using this kind of trick to get out of embarrassment is just pathetic.”

Huo Xingchen scratched his head, laughing awkwardly. “If it’s obvious, why say it? It’s no fun.”

He shrugged and found a seat, quickly suppressing his brazenness and lustful look.

Once he settled, Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly. “Yang Kai, I think you need to plan carefully. Your manor will soon be busier. Yesterday it was quiet; today three groups of reinforcements arrived at once. Other young masters probably don’t have that kind of charm. More people means livelier, but with unfamiliar forces, improper coordination could lead to unavoidable conflicts.”

Yang Kai chuckled softly. “With you here, do you think I need to worry?”

Qiu Yimeng gave him a mock glare. “Do you really think I'm your servant?”

“The capable always do more.” Fat Dong smiled broadly. “If Miss Qiu manages coordination, the Dong Family will have no objections.”

“Ziwei Valley too,” Fan Hong nodded gently.

They were all first-rate forces, roughly equal in strength. But Qiu Yimeng was different, born of the Qiu Family in Zhongdu, with strong personal power, truly qualified to oversee everything.

“Though I feel a little embarrassed saying this, Yingyue Sect is also willing to follow Miss Qiu’s coordination. Not just us; I think those who come later will have no objections either,” Chen Xueshu proclaimed.

“People coming later?” Qiu Yimeng’s eyes brightened, and Yang Kai also looked on with curiosity.

Chen Xueshu smiled. “Because we can’t be sure if this Yang Kai is the one we knew before, my Junior Sister and I came ahead to investigate. If it is, Yingyue Sect will join the succession war to assist Brother Yang. If not, we won’t get involved.”

“I see. When will your sect members arrive?” Qiu Yimeng showed no disdain despite Yingyue Sect being a second-rate sect, much to Chen Xueshu’s relief.

“In three days, already on their way. We’re just sending word back, then they’ll decide whether to continue coming,” Chen Xueshu smiled as he looked at Yang Kai. “Not only Yingyue Sect, but many others are on the way as well.”

“Who?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“They’re all people you know,” Chen Xueshu smiled. “Besides Yingyue Sect, there’s Shui Yue Hall, Wen Xin Palace, Fei Yu Pavilion, and Wan Hua Palace!”

“Wan Hua Palace is also joining the succession war?” Qiu Yimeng was moved, and Huo Xingchen laughed heartily, clapping his hands. “Interesting. This will be a feast for the eyes.”

Wan Hua Palace, a very special sect, was an all-female first-rate sect. Because it was all women, their fighting spirit was weak; they never interfered in succession wars. But unexpectedly, this time Wan Hua Palace was participating—and had chosen to side with Yang Kai.

“Yes, these sects suffered heavy losses in the recent battles against Cangyun Evil Land in Zhongdu, so they originally did not want to get involved. But upon hearing about Yang Kai here, they changed their minds,” Chen Xueshu explained.
