## Chapter 930 — True Yuan Ascending to Saint

Two days later, Yang Kai opened his eyes; his pupils gleamed brilliantly, as if lightning ran through them.

A trace of puzzlement lingered on his face.

He felt unclear about his own condition.

Upon returning to Lingxiao Pavilion, after walking through and gazing upon those familiar sights, he suddenly fell into a wondrous state of mind. At first, he thought he was about to break through, so he let it flow naturally, but when he awoke he realized he had not broken through to the Saint Realm at all.

His cultivation remained only at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, yet the True Yuan surging within him was drastically different from before.

Closing his eyes and probing with Divine Sense, he discovered that the True Yuan flowing through his meridians and flesh had grown far more condensed and refined; if the True Yuan before had been like a continuously flowing river, the current True Yuan was composed of countless tiny, subtle crystals attached to his flesh and channels.

When not in use they no longer flowed, but once deployed they responded more readily than before and possessed far greater destructive power.

The Yang Liquid stored in his Dantian seemed to be undergoing a transmutation as well, becoming like one glittering gem after another, dazzling to behold.

Yang Kai was confused and had no idea what had caused all this.

He carefully checked his body and found nothing amiss; on the contrary he felt unusually clear-headed and vigorous, as if the change in his internal power were beneficial rather than harmful.

At the very least, Yang Kai felt, deep inside, that he had grown stronger.

He sent out his Divine Sense, and before long Li Rong and Han Fei flew over together, slipped into the cave, and bowed: “Lord, what are your orders?”

These past two days Li Rong and Han Fei had been guests in Lingxiao Pavilion, helping clean up the current mess; they had noticed Yang Kai cultivating here and had therefore not disturbed him until he called them.

“I have some questions to ask you two.” Yang Kai gestured for them to sit and speak slowly.

The two exchanged a glance and pursed their lips in a smile. Even Han Fei revealed the faint trace of a smile, and in that instant, the icy aura around her seemed to melt away considerably.

In their impression, Yang Kai seemed capable of anything; that he would seek their counsel surprised them greatly.

They sat down. Li Rong asked, “Lord, is there something unclear about your cultivation?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded and relaxed his body and mind. “Use your Divine Sense to examine my internal power and see if you can detect anything wrong.”

“Wrong?” Han Fei exclaimed in surprise.

“Then pardon us.” Li Rong wasted no words and sent her Divine Sense into Yang Kai to probe.

A moment later, her beautiful eyes suddenly lit up, and she gave a low cry: “True Yuan ascending to Saint?”

Han Fei likewise showed an expression of mingled surprise and joy, beaming at Yang Kai and chuckling, “Congratulations, Lord. At your cultivation speed, you may be very close to entering the Saint Realm.”

“Indeed—reaching the point where True Yuan begins to transform into Saint is extraordinary. At your pace, I estimate at most two or three years to enter the Saint Realm, and with some opportunity or an Enlightenment, it could be even sooner.”

“Stop!” Yang Kai raised a hand to signal them, frowning at the two with bewilderment. “Explain first: what does ‘True Yuan transforming into Saint’ mean? Why are you so certain I’m close to entering the Saint Realm?”

Li Rong and Han Fei exchanged looks; they both showed astonishment, then burst into laughter—clear, bell-like peals that filled the cave.

Yang Kai felt nothing short of uncomfortable.

Li Rong’s laughter alone would have been fine, but even the usually icy Han Fei laughed so hard she bent forward and back, her limbs trembling—clearly she had discovered something amusing, and that discovery concerned him.

Yet he knew nothing at all.

“Have you two laughed enough?” Yang Kai glared at them angrily.

Sensing Yang Kai’s annoyance, Li Rong and Han Fei quickly suppressed their laughter though they still struggled to contain it, covering their mouths with delicate hands and hugging their shoulders.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, utterly exasperated.

After quite a while, Li Rong and Han Fei finally composed their expressions. The former spoke: “Master, in all your cultivation up to now… have you never received systematic guidance from anyone?”

“Why do you ask?”

“Because if someone had instructed you systematically, you would know what True Yuan transforming into Saint means, and you would know that this is the pivotal threshold for entering the Saint Realm.”

“The pivotal threshold for entering the Saint Realm?” Yang Kai’s interest was piqued. “Explain it carefully.”

Li Rong and Han Fei immediately began to explain, finishing each other’s sentences.

“There are countless Transcendent Realm warriors in this world, but those who successfully break into the Saint Realm are likely fewer than one percent. Why can so many Transcendent experts not fathom the secret of entering the Saint? The greatest reason is this transformation of True Yuan into Saint.”

“A cultivator, from the beginning of their training to reaching the Saint Realm, advances step by step; every major breakthrough is arduous and difficult—each great leap is a baptism from within outwards. Yet during this entire growth there are two points of colossal change in a warrior’s internal power.”

“One is breaking from the Separation and Union Realm into the True Yuan Realm, when a cultivator’s Yuan Qi converts into True Yuan. The difference in the power contained between the two is vast; you, Lord, surely felt it yourself.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Before the Separation and Union Realm, the power flowing inside a cultivator was Yuan Qi; upon breaking into the True Yuan Realm, what flows inside becomes True Yuan.

The distinction is fundamental; setting aside advancement in rank, purely in terms of power shift, when Yuan Qi turns into True Yuan a cultivator’s combat ability surges dramatically.

“The second time is the Transcendent Realm’s leap into the Saint Realm!” Li Rong’s voice dropped and brightened. “Because what flows inside a Saint Realm expert is not True Yuan.”

“Not True Yuan?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, finding that hard to accept.

No one had ever told him this before.

“Correct. What flows in a Saint Realm expert is Saint Yuan, a level far above True Yuan.”

Yang Kai was shaken into silence for a long while.

Han Fei, considering beside him, offered an analogy: “To give an example, between two crystal stones of equal size, an Upper-Level crystal contains far more energy than a Lower-Level one, and a Saint Crystal contains more energy than an Upper-Level crystal. Comparatively, Yuan Qi is like a Lower-Level crystal, True Yuan like an Upper-Level crystal, and Saint Yuan corresponds to a Saint Crystal.”

Yang Kai understood this obvious truth perfectly.

“Because of a certain opportunity, the True Yuan within Master’s body has already begun transforming into Saint Yuan. Once the transformation is complete, and the day comes when Master comprehends the mysteries of the Saint Realm, that will be the moment of your breakthrough into the Saint Realm.” Li Rong looked at him with excitement, truly overjoyed at his rapid growth.

“Nobody ever told you this before?” Han Fei asked in surprise.

The reason they hadn’t explained these things to Yang Kai was because they assumed he already knew such common knowledge, and never imagined that he was completely ignorant of it.

“No one telling you is understandable,” Li Rong smiled. “Your growth has been so rapid our elders probably didn’t expect you to already be experiencing True Yuan transforming into Saint. Even if no one mentioned it now, someone would later—at least the Grand Elder of the Sacred Land would inform you.”

Yang Kai lightly inclined his head; having learned why his current state was what it was, he felt relieved.

“So what should I do now?” Yang Kai asked after a moment of thought.

“Do nothing special—continue as before. Do what you normally do.” Li Rong replied with a smile.

“Is there no way to speed up the True Yuan-to-Saint transformation?” Yang Kai frowned. “I remember when Yuan Qi became True Yuan, medicines could be used to aid the process, making True Yuan denser and purer.”

“That applied to earlier foundational stages. Those who reach True Yuan transforming into Saint have already opened their foundation; this phase cannot be sped up artificially and must proceed naturally.”

“I see.” Yang Kai exhaled softly, a small excitement stirring in his heart.

Once all the True Yuan turns into Saint Yuan and one comprehends the secret of entering the Saint Realm, one can reach that realm.

Yang Kai was not worried about comprehending it; what might be an obstacle for others was nothing to him.

He had absorbed so many insights from Saint Realm cultivators regarding the Martial Dao that those things had already become his nourishment—breaking into the Saint Realm would naturally be without doubt.

Now he only needed to wait for the internal transformation, so the time required would likely be far shorter than Li Rong’s estimate.

After a short while, Yang Kai put away his thoughts and stopped dwelling on entering the Saint Realm. He rose and asked, “How are things here at Lingxiao Pavilion?”

“They’re almost settled.” Li Rong replied.

“Then we should be on our way.” Yang Kai said, leading the way out of his cave.

He had planned to revisit his old haunts briefly and then depart immediately for Zhongdu, but the delay caused by the True Yuan transforming into Saint had kept him two days longer than intended.

Lingxiao Pavilion was packed to overflowing; disciples from the three sects had gathered here, and Su Mu could only do his best to arrange lodging, yet still couldn’t accommodate everyone—many had to sit on the ground, using the sky for a cover and the earth for a bed.

Inside the Council Hall, Su Mu and several Elders of the Pavilion were present, along with Hu Man of the Blood Battle Gang, the Twin Flowers sisters, Xiao Ruohan of Fengyu Tower, and Fang Ziqi—all gathered together.

When Yang Kai arrived, they seemed to be discussing something.

At that moment, all eyes turned eagerly to Yang Kai, faces bright with excitement.

“Brother-in-law, are you going to Zhongdu?” Su Mu suddenly asked.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Then go win glory and return triumphant!” Su Mu shouted.

Yang Kai stared at him in surprise.

Su Mu grinned. “We know our place and won’t hold you back, but brother-in-law, you must teach those people a lesson—do not go easy on them.”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded seriously. “Don’t worry—I won’t let any of them return alive!”

Turning, he called to the outside, “Shi Kun!”

“At your command!” Shi Kun replied and appeared.

“You stay here and help take care of our comrades. If anyone dares to attack again, invoke the name of the Sacred Land—I want to see who still dares to defy the might of our Sacred Land.”

“Yes!”
