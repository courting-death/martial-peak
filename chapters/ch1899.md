## Chapter 1899 — Friend, Don't Take It Personally

In the great hall a violent wind rose; apart from Xue Yue, who was sheltered by Yang Kai, everyone else lurched about, crying out in pain.

"Chairman Ai Ou, what does this mean?" Yang Kai squinted at the broad-shouldered man before him, his voice cold.

Ai Ou's expression wavered between shock and doubt; his eyes opened wide, fierce as a tiger and bright as the blazing sun, inspiring dread. Suddenly he laughed: "Indeed, heroes have always sprung from youth. Boy, you really are extraordinary. When Ni Guang told me about you I did not entirely believe it, but now it seems Ni Guang underestimated you—you surpass Yue'er by more than one grade of talent."

"You flatter me, Senior; I only gained some opportunities," Yang Kai replied, his manner neither humble nor arrogant.

Ai Ou suddenly reached out. "Hand it over."

Xue Yue stood to one side, her face pale; she had not understood why her father had struck at Yang Kai at once, but upon hearing those words she suddenly began to see the reason.

Yang Kai frowned, pondered for a moment, and then seemed to realize. He smiled and asked, "May I ask what it is you want from me, Senior?"

"You know perfectly well!" Ai Ou said, growing impatient.

Yang Kai said, "If you are asking about that drop I possess, I can tell you now: even if I gave it to you it would be useless. Madam Gu's soul is damaged; that thing can only mend bodily wounds, and that should be clear to you."

Xue Yue's mother had been named Gu Bihu, which she had already told Yang Kai on the way here, so Yang Kai's calling her Madam Gu was not incorrect.

"I know that," Ai Ou said in a low voice.

"So you mean you want that one thing?" Yang Kai raised a brow and chuckled, "On that point I must refuse."

In the hall, a cluster of Origin-Grade alchemists listened in confusion, craning their necks in curiosity, not knowing what Yang Kai meant by a drop or by "that one thing".

But Yang Kai, Ai Ou, and Xue Yue all understood exactly what was being referred to.

Immortal Source Liquid, the Everlasting Tree!

The reason Ai Ou had lunged at Yang Kai was to seize his Everlasting Tree and use it to treat Gu Bihu. The Immortal Source Liquid could not restore Madam Gu's damaged soul, but the Everlasting Tree was different: owning an Everlasting Tree meant escaping death and annihilation; repairing a damaged soul would be almost trivial.

"Don't tell me you've already fused it!" Ai Ou's eyes flashed with a terrifying light as if he would devour a man, glaring at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai only smiled and said nothing.

Ai Ou's heart sank; thinking carefully, he realized the possibility was real.

After all, according to Ni Guang's account, when they had entered the Lost Realm both Yang Kai and Xue Yue had been only at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; and yet in just a few years this youngster had already advanced to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm!

Even granting a cultivator countless opportunities, it was hardly likely their power would rise so far in such a short span.

The only explanation was that the chance had been enormous.

And fusing an Everlasting Tree was exactly that sort of enormous chance.

Ai Ou, incredulous, swept his Divine Sense over Yang Kai and was shocked to find Yang Kai's qi and blood brimming with vigor; the concealed surging fluctuations of qi and blood made even an expert like him shudder.

"You really have fused it!" Ai Ou cried out, his face ashen, the last shred of hope suddenly snapping off.

He was not despondent because such a treasure was beyond his reach, but because he could not use the Everlasting Tree to save Gu Bihu.

Yang Kai did not bother to explain, letting him persist in the misunderstanding.

After a moment's silence, Ai Ou said in a low, urgent voice, "Even if you fused it, it matters not. The energy of that treasure must be present in your blood; if we draw your blood, Madam will surely be saved!"

He was now desperate and clutching at any straw.

Hearing this, Xue Yue's face changed; she sprang forward and stood before Yang Kai, whispering, "Father, you must not..."

"Get out of the way; this is no matter for you to decide!" Ai Ou bellowed.

"So the illustrious chairman of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, the overlord of this Star Domain, is nothing more than this—famous in name but disappointing in person!" Yang Kai snorted coldly.

"Boy, watch your tongue," Ai Ou said, eyes narrowing.

Yang Kai sneered coldly, "If it weren't for Xue Yue, do you think I'd be standing here talking to you politely? Just for attacking me a moment ago, I could turn Shuitian City inside out. Were it not for the fact you're unsettled trying to save your woman, the Hengluo Commerce Guild would already be nothing but a wisp of smoke!"

Xue Yue turned pale and hurriedly tugged on Yang Kai's sleeve, whispering, "Speak properly."

Yang Kai smiled, "I can speak properly, but your father would do well to remain calm."

Ai Ou suddenly came to his senses, realizing the man before him was not a pushover but a fellow Second Stage of the Void King Realm whose strength was nearly on par; he stiffened.

If one at that level were truly enraged, today would very likely end badly; at minimum, Shuitian City would be destroyed.

"Boy, you are insolent," Ai Ou said, though he had regained much composure and could not afford to lose face.

"I just came from Purple Star," Yang Kai said with a faint smile. The remark sounded odd, but he trusted Ai Ou would understand what he meant.

Ai Ou stiffened and stared at Yang Kai, as if suddenly understanding. "So it was you who did it."

Xue Yue had not received news of the events on Purple Star, but as chairman of the Hengluo Commerce Guild Ai Ou had eyes and ears across the Star Domain; how could he not know of such a large affair?

Upon hearing Yang Kai's words, Ai Ou immediately realized that the upheaval on Purple Star some months earlier had been caused by the person standing before him.

That was the one Kuang Shizong had personally pursued and failed to capture—a remarkable figure! Even if Ai Ou himself had ridden out, he could not guarantee returning unscathed.

Realizing this, Ai Ou inhaled and inclined his head, saying, "I was discourteous just now—friend, please don't blame me!"

"Friend..." Xue Yue's mouth twitched; she thought her father addressing Yang Kai as a friend muddled the generations. She shot Yang Kai a resentful glance.

Yang Kai let out a dry laugh, "You exaggerate, Senior. A man is bound to be impulsive when his wife is ill—I understand that."

"That is good. Friend is indeed magnanimous. I've heard much about you; Ni Guang praises you highly. Since you are in Shuitian City, rest here a while; after I settle present matters we shall speak at length." Ai Ou said.

From Ai Ou's tone Yang Kai immediately sensed that Ni Guang had likely not told him about the matter between Yang Kai and Xue Yue; otherwise Ai Ou would not have spoken so.

"Father, Yang Kai is an alchemist!" Xue Yue, uncomfortable at her father's familiar address, quickly changed the subject.

"Oh?" Ai Ou looked at Yang Kai in surprise. "A friend with such cultivation is also versed in pillcraft?"

"I have some involvement," Yang Kai replied modestly.

"Not just a little, I suspect—boy, do not be too modest," a voice spoke from the side.

Ai Ou's brow furrowed and a hint of displeasure crossed his face; few dared interrupt him. But when he saw who had spoken, his expression softened, as the speaker clearly carried weight in his estimation.

Yang Kai turned his head and after a moment his expression became one of utter astonishment.

There, among the gathered Origin-Grade alchemists, a familiar face stood smiling at him.

"Master Zong Ao!" Yang Kai brightened and hurried forward, cupping his fist in salute.

The man who had spoken was none other than Zong Ao, an Upper-Level Origin-Grade alchemist! When he and Xue Yue had gone to Rainfall Star long ago, Yang Kai had once stayed with Zong Ao for a time.

Back then Yang Kai had been weak and not outstanding in pillcraft, while Zong Ao had already been a lofty Upper-Level Origin-Grade alchemist.

Yang Kai had discussed alchemy with Zong Ao and both had benefited; the spiritual pill that treated Xue Yue's condition had been suggested by Zong Ao and refined by Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had not expected to meet Zong Ao here.

But thinking it through, it made sense: though Zong Ao had never formally joined the Hengluo Commerce Guild, he resided on Rainfall Star and was, at best, half of the guild.

With Ai Ou's wife suddenly ill, Zong Ao would naturally be called upon.

"Don't rag on me, kid," Zong Ao scoffed, curling his lip. "Decades apart and you've already climbed to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, while I'm still hovering at Upper-Level Origin-Grade—what a tragic old man I am!"

"Master, you are modest; you already had deep achievements in pillcraft then, and by now you must be even more refined—Void King-Grade cannot be far off," Yang Kai said.

Zong Ao smiled, a trace of pride in his expression.

"You two know each other?" Ai Ou asked in surprise.

Zong Ao grinned, "Of course I know him. Decades ago we discussed alchemical theory — and, ah, that brat even made off with quite a few of my refining furnaces!"

Yang Kai laughed, "Those furnaces are useless to me now. If Master wants them back I can return them."

"No need; they are of no use to me either," Zong Ao waved his hand. "Keep them as a memento."

Yang Kai's eyes flashed with a peculiar light as he said thoughtfully, "It seems Master really is about to break through to Void King-Grade — the formula for the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill must have come from you, then."

"Yes," Zong Ao's expression turned serious. "Madam Gu's condition is obvious, but there are few methods to save her. Refining the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill is one option—and the easiest to accomplish."

"Have all the materials been gathered?" Yang Kai asked.

"The other ingredients are negotiable. Though rare, with the Hengluo Commerce Guild's resources collecting them is straightforward; only one item is hard to obtain—the inner core of a Seven-Colored Stag..." Zong Ao said.

"The inner core has already been found; it was delivered here ten days ago!" Ai Ou interjected.
