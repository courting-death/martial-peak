## Chapter 449 — Beast

Dong Qinghan’s words reached her ears. Lan Chudie’s beautiful eyes flickered, and she smiled lightly at him, saying, "Young Master, why bring this up?"

Dong Qinghan shrugged, “Just saying it casually.”

After that, he started chatting with Dong Qingyan beside him, seeming genuinely casual.

Lan Chudie opened her mouth, wanting to say more about Yang Kai but found herself unable to muster the courage.

Looking at the figures ahead, Lan Chudie slowly shook her head, realizing this lifetime would likely never offer such good opportunities as before.

Half an hour later, everyone arrived together at the manor.

The manor was quiet and deserted. Aside from Qu Gaoyi guarding the main hall and some ordinary maids, everyone else had been taken away by Qiu Yimeng.

Yang Kai was busy arranging for the people from Yao Wang Valley to enter the main hall. He had servants serve tea but didn’t even have time to exchange many words with his Senior Sister.

The people from Yao Wang Valley were neither pretentious nor overly formal. They didn’t treat Yang Kai as an outsider, so the atmosphere was naturally lively and harmonious.

An hour later, Qiu Yimeng and her group returned, dusty and hurried. Those nine groups only traveled around War City without launching any actual attacks. Even so, this was enough to intimidate the other disciples of the Yang Family.

Yang Kai introduced the support he had gathered to Qin Ze. Qin Ze only nodded coldly in response, showing little emotion.

One could see the pride of the alchemists. This was still looking out for Yang Kai’s face—under usual circumstances, Qin Ze wouldn’t even bother to meet these people.

Qiu Yimeng hurriedly arranged lodging for the group from Yao Wang Valley. Qin Ze was polite to the Young Lady and spoke a few words praising the Qiu Family’s heirs, making Qiu Yimeng blush shyly, full of humility.

Very soon, everything was properly arranged.

While Qiu Yimeng was busy, Yang Kai was busy as well. This time, a forced, aggressive strike disrupted his original plans, so he had to set up defenses tonight to prevent his brothers from harboring doubts and launching a joint surprise attack.

He worked until nightfall before having a moment to rest.

Just as he was about to retire, the Young Lady stopped him from the shadows.

“What is it?” Yang Kai looked at the pair of beautiful eyes in the dark and asked suspiciously.

“Hmph, I should be asking you that—why are you in such a hurry?” Qiu Yimeng blocked his way, her eyes appraising him up and down.

“Mind your own business.”

Qiu Yimeng snorted again, her tone oddly tinged, “Even if you don’t say it, I know. You’re going to find your Senior Sister, right?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai admitted plainly.

“I’ve long seen that your relationship is unusual.” Qiu Yimeng felt slightly sour inside, curling her lips and asking again, “Is she from your Sect?”

“That’s right. She is also from Lingxiao Pavilion.”

“But why do I see Qin Ze and that group treating her with such reverence? Even more respectful than toward you. She isn’t that much older, either. Strange. Is there something behind this?” Qiu Yimeng frowned deeply. While arranging lodging for the Yao Wang Valley group, she overheard a conversation between Qin Ze and Xia Ningshang. The deference shown was clearly that of a junior toward a senior, which felt unusual.

“There are reasons I can’t explain. You’ll know after some time,” Yang Kai said without explanation.

“This should be one part of your planned reinforcement, right?”

“Part of the plan, but I didn’t expect so many to come.”

Qiu Yimeng chuckled: “Thirty alchemists from Yao Wang Valley, and one of Mystery-Grade. Yang Kai, you’ve truly struck gold. If this news spreads, many will come seeking to join you.”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “There are advantages and disadvantages. You should understand this better than I.”

Qiu Yimeng nodded: “You don’t want to stand out, but now a tall tree attracts wind. What will you do later? Continue to hide your light and bide your time?”

“Why not?” Yang Kai smiled widely. “Beauty, you only see the buzz caused by Yao Wang Valley’s arrival but don’t calculate their combat strength. They came to join me, causing my brothers to be wary, but don’t forget, this group is weak in cultivation. After my brothers calm down and realize this, they won’t take them seriously.”

Qiu Yimeng was stunned for a moment and then nodded: “True. I was too excited by their arrival and overlooked this.”

Even with this group of alchemists joining, it would take at least three months for Yang Kai’s forces to undergo any substantial cultivation improvements, assuming sufficient material supply.

Three months is a lot of time for events to unfold.

Moreover, there are also alchemists in their own manor, but they cannot compare in skill to those from Yao Wang Valley.

In reality, it’d take Yao Wang Valley’s people at least three months to increase the cultivation of Yang Kai’s group and at least six months to open a clear gap over other martial artists in the manors.

Today’s incident was simply the Yang Family disciples panicking at hearing these alchemists had arrived, making a mountain out of a molehill.

Qiu Yimeng pondered and spoke softly, “So, their joining doesn’t pose much short-term threat to the others.”

“But over time, their influence will grow.”

“It depends if they realize this,” Yang Kai smiled broadly, his teeth gleaming white in the darkness, startling Qiu Yimeng.

Frowning, Qiu Yimeng laughed softly: “I noticed your attitude toward me these days has changed. You're not as cold as before.”

“Is that so?” Yang Kai was a bit startled.

On recall, it was true. Qiu Yimeng had been too calculative before, making him reluctant to get close. But as the succession war unfolded and she left the Qiu Family to join his faction, he had begun to accept her, and his attitude changed subtly.

“Have you noticed my charm? Have you started to like me?” Qiu Yimeng teased coyly, eyes mischievous.

Yang Kai looked at her, a slow smile curling his lips, but he said nothing, stepping closer.

The Young Lady suddenly changed color, glanced around, and saw no one was nearby. She took a step back, only to be cornered against the wall.

In the next moment, a hot aura surged out. Yang Kai acted brazenly, one hand propping against the wall, the other resting on her fragrant shoulder as he looked down at her.

Their distance was less than an inch. The pressure was so intense that Qiu Yimeng panicked slightly. She realized stopping him here to chat was a mistake, and she shouldn’t have provoked him just now.

“What are you doing?” Her breath became rapid, her eyes flickering. “Fifty zhang to the front left is Xiang Tianxiao’s ambush. Thirty zhang to the right hides two experts of the Huo Family. Eighty zhang in front on the rooftop are three members of the Duanmu Family. I warn you not to act rashly!”

“Hehe!” Yang Kai laughed oddly. “What are you afraid of? We are allies, after all. I’m just getting a bit closer to you.”

“That doesn’t require this... move aside.” Qiu Yimeng had never felt so anxious, not daring to meet Yang Kai’s aggressive gaze. Her body was pressed against the wall with nowhere to flee.

“I can get even closer. Want to try?” Yang Kai smiled wickedly, eerily quiet.

The Young Lady lifted her eyelids and glared at him angrily, her heart bitter. Seeing the sly and proud look in his eyes, suddenly a light flashed in her own.

She bit her lip, then smiled faintly and stretched both hands out, wrapping them around Yang Kai’s neck like water snakes, her voice soft, “Alright, then come on. Let’s see if you still have the face to see your Senior Sister afterward.”

Her toes rose, and her supple chest pressed against Yang Kai’s, full of provocation.

Yang Kai’s eyes twinkled, then he pinched her cheek and laughed heartily, releasing her.

“A little fun’s fine, but don’t take me seriously. I can’t handle it.” His voice receded, and when Qiu Yimeng recovered from her shock, Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen.

“Beast!” Qiu Yimeng was utterly aggrieved, touching her cheek which hurt terribly.

This foul man had no idea how to be gentle, lacking the slightest thought of cherishing beauty.

After sulking for a while, she stared at where Yang Kai had disappeared, her expression forlorn. Undeniably, this man was the finest, most outstanding man she had ever met and perhaps the most outstanding in the world.

Such a man was fully qualified to deserve her, and she also harbored a certain affection for him.

But... Qiu Yimeng neither dared nor would think of him that way. Such a man would never be bound by her.

Compared to being with him, Qiu Yimeng wanted more to see how far this man could go, what heights he could ultimately reach to look down upon the myriad beings!

Perhaps when that day came, she could abandon everything and stand by his side. But absolutely not now!

Xia Ningshang’s door was tightly closed. The veiled girl rested her chin in her palm, sitting by the table lost in thought and memories. The flickering lamps around her reflected her unsettled mood.

Yang Kai’s words from earlier echoed in her ears. Every time she thought of them, Xia Ningshang’s heart overflowed with sweetness, her delicate face always adorned with a joyful yet shy smile, but none had the fortune to witness it.

Yang Kai had never spoken such direct and embarrassing words to her before.

At the deepest moments, Xia Ningshang blushed intensely, covering her face with both hands, feeling too shy to face anyone.

The happiest, sweetest days were those spent in Lingxiao Pavilion, though sadly, those moments did not last long.

Suddenly, the door burst open and then shut again. A figure rushed inside like a whirlwind. Xia Ningshang was startled from her thoughts and barely let out a cry before being carried horizontally to the bed.

Her recently gathered True Essence and Divine Sense immediately dispersed. Though she couldn’t see the visitor’s face, the familiar scent told her exactly who it was.
