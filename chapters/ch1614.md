## Chapter 1614 — Qian Tong Breaks Through

Yang Kai was also at a loss, staring at the young man in bewilderment.

From the crowd’s reaction, Yang Kai could already tell that this young man’s background was anything but ordinary — that so-called Lord Wudao was without a doubt a Void King Realm master.

Otherwise the people here would not be behaving with such exaggerated alarm.

But why would this fellow help him? Yang Kai felt the youth looked familiar, as if he had been seen somewhere before.

“Friend, the favor from the Blood Prison—I’ve repaid it. From this point on, we owe each other nothing,” the young man said with a grin toward Yang Kai.

Hearing that, Yang Kai suddenly understood!

He had indeed seen him, though only briefly — he was one of the thirty who had left Domain Stone Mountain in safety! Before departing the man had inclined his head to Yang Kai in thanks.

At the time there had been too many people for Yang Kai to pay it any mind.

So that was the favor he referred to; Yang Kai finally pieced it together.

The man was clearly thanking him for his loud warning back then, which had spared him his life.

This fellow was interesting, Yang Kai smiled, clasped his fists at a distance and announced himself: "Yang Kai!"

"Xu Binbai!" the youth returned the salute.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, an inkling telling him this man was not simple — not merely because he had a Void King Realm master behind him, but because he himself seemed to possess uncommon strength.

It was a pure intuition, with no concrete basis.

But Yang Kai trusted his intuition!

The two were not close, and Yang Kai had no intention of speaking at length; as he prepared to take Lin Yurao away, the surrounding Spiritual Qi trembled as if an invisible great hammer struck the void, and that vibration sank into everyone’s hearts, changing their expressions.

Very quickly, a wondrous force transmitted from some distant place, like a keen blade driving straight into the hearts of those present.

Yang Kai frowned and looked up toward that direction.

Xu Binbai’s face also showed surprise, as if he had thought of something; his expression shifted continually.

"Someone is breaking through, and ascending to the Void King Realm!" a trembling voice suddenly cried out.

The words exploded like thunder.

Everyone turned in unison to the speaker, their faces aghast.

"Is that true?"

"Yes. This is definitely the prelude to a Void King Realm breakthrough. I once had the fortune to witness one many years ago; though time has passed my memory is vivid — this feeling is exactly the same. There is surely someone about to break through to the Void King Realm!" the man spoke with conviction.

"It must be one of the experts who came out of the Blood Prison; it seems they benefited greatly there. To emerge and immediately be on the verge of breakthrough…"

"The Blood Prison truly is a fine place for trials — this fellow’s luck is indeed extraordinary."

"What are you standing there for? Hurry up and go see! A Void King breakthrough is not something one witnesses casually. I wonder which lucky soul it is."

A Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert’s breakthrough is usually long prepared for. Those from a Sect naturally attempt the ascension within their Sect; when the breakthrough comes the Sect’s formation fully opens and every disciple stands guard to prevent interference.

Those without a Sect also invite trusted relatives and friends, seeking a secluded, safe location.

Few omit making comprehensive preparations.

Therefore a Void King Realm breakthrough is extremely difficult to witness.

Yet here, on this vast plain, an expert was about to shatter his own shackles.

This person had clearly made no preparations and was acting in haste.

Such a grand commotion was something one might not witness even once in ten thousand years.

Countless martial artists outside the Blood Prison would not miss such an opportunity; to observe a Void King Realm expert’s breakthrough is experience, an opening — one might thereby comprehend some truth of the Domain. It could benefit a person for life.

After guessing at the truth, the cultivators gathered outside the Blood Prison produced Star Shuttles, turning into streams of multicolored light and flying toward the distance.

"Sect Master!" Lin Yurao’s pretty face had gone pale and her delicate body trembled.

"What’s the matter?" Yang Kai noticed her expression and couldn’t help frowning.

"If I’m not mistaken, the one breaking through… should be Qian Tong!" Lin Yurao said in a grave voice.

"What?" Yang Kai was taken aback, his face instantly grave. "Elder Qian?"

"More than eighty percent likely!" Lin Yurao bit her lip. "The reason Elder Qian wasn’t waiting here was because he felt fluctuations in his qi — signs of an imminent breakthrough — so he hurried away to find a safe place to ascend. But judging by the looks of it… it seems there isn’t time."

“Go!” Yang Kai immediately grasped the gravity of the situation. If the one undergoing the breakthrough truly was Qian Tong, then the current situation was anything but good.

Outside the Blood Prison there were at least a thousand martial artists, of whom seventy to eighty percent were Origin Returning Realm; they now rushed toward the breakthrough site. If they disturbed Qian Tong, at best his ascension would fail, at worst he could die on the spot.

Yang Kai did not know what grand spectacle would accompany a Void King Realm breakthrough, but judging from the tumult when he had broken through the Origin Returning Realm himself, it would be extraordinary. The Heaven‑and‑Earth Energy Baptism is a tremendous trial for Qian Tong; at this moment he must not be disturbed.

To think Qian Tong had taken the lead in crossing this threshold! Yang Kai felt some surprise.

After all, when they parted at Domain Stone Mountain Qian Tong had shown no sign; in just over ten days he had clearly encountered another opportunity.

Yang Kai’s speed was astonishing. He did not use a Star Shuttle; a pair of nearly transparent wings appeared on his back, wind and thunder murmured, streams of light danced across the feathers, and he overtook one cultivator after another.

Suddenly, as if sensing something, Yang Kai turned his head to one side.

Not far beside him, a figure was keeping pace; catching Yang Kai’s gaze, he turned and smiled at him.

Xu Binbai! This fellow really was not simple — not only could he match Yang Kai’s speed, he did so with ease.

"Brother Yang, your wings are something," Xu Binbai glanced at the Wind‑and‑Thunder Wings on Yang Kai’s back and a trace of admiration flashed in his eyes.

With every surge of wind and crash of thunder, Yang Kai’s figure shot forward a great distance, forcing him to muster all his strength just to keep up.

"You’re not bad either!" Yang Kai nodded coolly.

“The same to you.” Xu Binbai smiled faintly, then asked thoughtfully, “Brother Yang, you seem rather tense—could it be that the one attempting the breakthrough has some connection to you?”

"If it’s that person, then yes!" Yang Kai had no mood for small talk and answered gravely.

"Oh? Allow me to congratulate Brother Yang in advance — a Sect producing a Void King Realm expert is a tremendous matter. If later Brother Yang needs anything from me, don’t be shy; just ask."

Yang Kai brightened and hurriedly clasped his fists. "My thanks to Brother Xu."

The other’s willingness to help was the best possible thing. Although Yang Kai did not know exactly what level that Wudao held, from how others treated Xu Binbai it was clear that even among Void King Realm figures, he was exceptionally formidable.

Flying under the protection of such prestige made things more convenient.

As the two exchanged words, they had already arrived. In a blur of motion, Yang Kai descended like a falling star, crashing to the ground beside the gathered group.

A moment later Xu Binbai floated down lightly, every movement casual and dashing.

"Sect Master, you’ve arrived!" Yang Xiuzhu and Chu Hanyi were startled when they saw Yang Kai and hurriedly saluted.

Mo Yu nodded lightly, and Zhao Tianze was present as well; he stepped forward to greet Yang Kai.

After scanning them to be sure everyone was safe, Yang Kai drew a deep breath and asked in a low voice, "Is it Elder Qian?"

"Yes!" Chu Hanyi’s brow was tightly knit. "It happened too suddenly; we were all caught off guard!"

They clearly understood the seriousness: if the breakthrough occurred here it could turn a joyful event into disaster.

Zhao Tianze gave a wry smile. “I had originally planned to take him to a place five hundred thousand li away—extremely secluded, rarely visited, and rich in Spiritual Qi. Who would’ve thought that Elder Qian would…”

"It’s not your fault." Yang Kai frowned. "By the way, City Lord Zhao, what did Elder Qian encounter in there? Why did he suddenly need to break through?"

"He didn’t encounter anything in particular. After parting from you, Elder Qian plunged into several Domain whirlpools and seemed to gain great harvests," Zhao Tianze replied respectfully.

"I see!" Yang Kai nodded lightly.

The few who had followed him to Cuiwei Star had all lingered for many years at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Each of them had the qualification to launch an assault on the Void King Realm; what they lacked was an understanding of Shi.

Once the Shi is perfected, one can break through.

Qian Tong had clearly reached that requirement.

This was his chance and his destiny!

As they spoke more and more cultivators arrived, and at Qian Tong’s location the Spiritual Qi became increasingly violent; an odd and profound power wafted from there. At first it spread slowly, but in the blink of an eye it burst forth.

Qian Tong’s Shi!

It covered a radius of several hundred zhang; winds screamed, countless whirlwinds formed, connecting heaven and earth and packing that several‑hundred‑zhang area so tightly that nothing could pass — the spectacle was terrifying.

Qian Tong’s Shi had indeed matured; his Shi had fused with his unique power.

"It really is a Void King Realm breakthrough!" the arriving cultivators shouted wildly, their eyes wide as they peered forward, trying to see more clearly.

Some even pushed past where Yang Kai and the others stood to positions extremely close, watching while they probed the many wonders contained in Heaven and Earth.

This was Qian Tong’s comprehension of the mysteries of the Void King Realm; during his ascent it would radiate outward without reservation, drawing any Origin Returning Realm cultivator like a magnet.

Yang Kai’s face darkened. Leaping into the sky, he cupped his fists toward the crowd below and called out loudly, “Everyone, please do not come too close—lest you disturb this senior’s state of mind!”

Those standing nearer looked up at him with scorn, curled their lips, and paid him no heed.
