## Chapter 1933 — If You Have the Ability, Come Take It

"We'll go with you," Ai Ou said in a low voice.

"Not bad — with the three of us combined, we might still have a chance to defeat him!" Chi Yue nodded.

Yang Kai shook his head. “You’re thinking far too simply. That new power of his… it’s far too strong. If I can’t defeat him, even if we all attack together, it would be meaningless. However, if the two of you assist Ghost Ancestor and his group, you may be able to seize an opening to escape this place.”

"Then what will you do?" Ai Ou asked in alarm.

"I'll figure out a way to leave. Don't forget, escaping with one's life is my specialty." Yang Kai smiled confidently and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.

Hearing him, Ai Ou and Chi Yue exchanged a glance before nodding. Ai Ou said in a low voice, "Kid, don't you die."

"Be careful!" Chi Yue also warned, then the two of them flashed away together to join Ghost Ancestor and the others.

Yin Lesheng watched everything unfold but made no move to stop them; from his perspective it seemed no great matter even if the five were allowed to assemble — relying on the strength of Feng De and Liu Qianyun would be enough to deal with them.

"Want to fight me one-on-one? Kid, aren't you being a little arrogant?" Yin Lesheng looked at Yang Kai at his leisure and taunted.

Yang Kai chuckled softly and said calmly, "As the saying goes, it's better to resolve enmities than to form them. We're all aiming for the Star Realm; there's no need to slaughter each other here. Besides, we have no past grievances or recent hatred — we didn't even know one another before — so why are you doing this?"

"Are you afraid?" Yin Lesheng sneered at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai only smiled without answering.

"Actually, it wouldn't hurt to tell you," Yin Lesheng said. "this Lord intends to strip the Stellar Origin power from your bodies and present it as a gift to the Huangquan Sect of the Star Realm, so whether you live or die makes no difference to me. If you're afraid, submit to this Lord and I can spare your lives!"

"Strip our Stellar Origin?" Yang Kai's expression shifted. "So that was your goal."

"Exactly. this Lord has waited here five years. At last you arrived — say, haven't you been unlucky?"

Yang Kai laughed aloud. "Indeed, it's not great luck — but… your luck isn't too good either."

"You still won't give up?" Yin Lesheng's face turned cold.

"I haven't lost yet — how would I give up?" Yang Kai's expression grew fierce; his figure flickered and he vanished from where he stood. The next moment he appeared before Yin Lesheng, spread his great hand and struck down while shouting, "Secret Art — Banishment!"

From that great hand, a ring of pitch-black force swirled, spinning like a vortex that suddenly expanded and bit toward Yin Lesheng like the maw of a beast.

Words were useless; Yang Kai had already struck first.

"What is this…" Yin Lesheng's eyes narrowed as he sensed the strange power contained within the black vortex. For the first time his expression grew serious; he thrust his hand forward and a majestic force burst out as he bellowed, "Break it for me!"

A thunderous boom…

Yang Kai's secret art was suddenly nullified; his body staggered slightly, but he did not give up. His hands fluttered like a butterfly's wings and he intoned in a deep voice, "Secret Art — Moon Blade!"

Whoosh whoosh whoosh…

Black attacks like razor blades formed and frenziedly shot toward Yin Lesheng.

"It's truly a spatial secret art!" Yin Lesheng's complexion shifted in astonishment as he looked at the scene before him.

When Yang Kai had first unleashed the Banishment secret art he had suspected as much, but had not been certain. Now, seeing the Spatial Force woven into the countless Moon Blades, he immediately knew Yang Kai was proficient in space.

And not merely proficient in a common way.

To be able to manipulate Spatial Force to this degree indicated extremely deep attainments in spatial power — at least a master-level figure.

Jealousy rose in Yin Lesheng's eyes. Space power was a recondite way, difficult to master; throughout history, those who truly commanded spatial power had all attained great achievements.

He, Yin Lesheng, was the expert of the Great Wilderness Star Domain, ruling the domain alone for countless years. After rising to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, he had once researched such esoteric powers.

Yet he had never found the door in; in the end he had to give up.

Now, however, he had witnessed the brilliant flowering of spatial power in the hands of someone at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

This both shocked and angered him.

Why could he not master a power that another so freely wielded? Was he inferior?

The thought struck and Yin Lesheng's eyes suddenly blazed red, a cold killing intent suffusing his body.

"So what if you have space power? Before absolute strength you can only cower at this Lord's feet!" Yin Lesheng roared, then gestured and the Huangquan Nether Veil he had set up in the distance seemed to be summoned; it condensed into a beam of light that shot toward him and enshrouded his body.

Sizzle sizzle sizzle sizzle…

The countless Moon Blades crashed against the Huangquan Nether Veil but could not pierce it; they only stirred ripples on the surface before vanishing.

Yang Kai's expression changed; he instantly realized that his opponent's defensive Secret Treasure was of an extremely high order, otherwise it would not have withstood his Moon Blade attacks.

Yin Lesheng glanced at the Moon Blades raging outside his aura and sneered, "this Lord's Huangquan Nether Veil is a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure passed down from the Star Realm — your methods? Even if you attack for ten thousand years you won't break it!"

As he spoke he endured the assault of countless Moon Blades and advanced to Yang Kai, suddenly throwing a punch.

Yang Kai's face darkened; he intended to use a spatial secret art to instantly move away, but the next moment he sensed something was wrong.

The surrounding space had grown viscous and his once-fluid spatial secret arts were being severely impeded.

Yin Lesheng sneered, "This is not your Star Domain — this is the Starlight Passage, the intersection of the Star Domains and the Star Realm. The heavenly laws here are hundreds or thousands of times stronger than in a Star Domain; your spatial secret art will be greatly limited here."

As his words fell, his fist slammed into the area in front of Yang Kai's chest.

The wind of the blow had not yet arrived, but the surging force it carried made Yang Kai's bones crack and his skin ache; if the punch landed it would either kill him or leave him gravely wounded.

At the critical moment Yang Kai shouted, "Dragon Transformation!"

A piercing dragon’s roar split the heavens, sweeping through the firmament and shaking all four directions.

Yin Lesheng was stunned; in the next instant he felt an ancient, desolate aura surge from Yang Kai's body — such strength made him tremble.

Layer upon layer of dragon scales, condensed from Saint Yuan, cloaked Yang Kai's right arm, and his right hand in an instant took on the shape of a dragon's claw.

At the same time a palm-sized dragon scale appeared on his chest.

It was a true dragon scale, a Secret Treasure that belonged to a real dragon.

That scale had been obtained from the Purple Star Treasure Vault and had long been refined into Yang Kai's body; combined with the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin he possessed, it could already manifest some true dragon might.

Boom…

Yin Lesheng's fist struck Yang Kai's chest; the imagined scene of a single punch ending Yang Kai's life did not occur — instead his own fist registered a stinging pain.

Yin Lesheng involuntarily stepped back a few paces, lifted his hand and was utterly stunned.

He found his hand was bleeding! In contrast Yang Kai, though shaken, had not suffered a grievous injury.

Yin Lesheng's gaze fell on the dragon scale on Yang Kai's chest; his eyes flickered and greed flared, "A true dragon scale? You actually refined it into your body?"

At that moment he behaved as if he had discovered a treasure, his expression growing fanatical.

After all, it was a genuine dragon scale — in value it far surpassed even his Huangquan Nether Veil.

If he could obtain that dragon scale, what achievements might he reach in the future?

"What right do you have to possess such a treasure?" Yin Lesheng cried, crazily attacking Yang Kai, "Hand it over to this Lord at once!"

"Then come and take it yourself!" Yang Kai flared with true fire. From his debut until now he had met countless mighty enemies and always turned danger into safety, but this foe was one he could not easily claim victory over.

The heart of the Martial Dao lay in perseverance: never breaking, always advancing.

An adversary as powerful as Yin Lesheng only fanned Yang Kai's blazing fighting spirit.

He faced him without fear, in a stance as if wagering his life.

Boom boom boom…

Their fists and feet collided. Yang Kai used Dragon Transformation and combined it with the Undying Five Elements Sword; his own strength had reached an unfathomable level, yet still he was not Yin Lesheng's match.

The force erupting from Yin Lesheng's body came like mountains overturning and seas surging.

The light of Yang Kai's Undying Five Elements Sword kept shattering; every time it reformed, Yin Lesheng struck it apart.

In the blink of an eye Yang Kai was bleeding profusely; if not for that true dragon scale protecting his vital spot, he probably would have been in dire straits.

Yin Lesheng, wrapped within the Huangquan Nether Veil, remained unbreakable; no matter how Yang Kai attacked, he could not pierce that defense and thus stood in an undefeated position.

"Kid, accept your fate — you are no match for me!" Yin Lesheng laughed arrogantly as he continued to inflict damage on Yang Kai.

"Come out!" Yang Kai suddenly roared.

In the next moment the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao and the Fire Bird Liu Yan both appeared.

Perhaps sensing Yang Kai's urgency, Xiaoxiao immediately transformed into a Stone Giant; its surface was covered with a layer of molten rock armor as it brandished the Heaven-Shaking Pillar and swung it down at Yin Lesheng.

Liu Yan transformed into the shape of a Fire Bird and opened her beak to spew violent thunder-fire.

Yin Lesheng's eyes narrowed; though surprised by Yang Kai's sudden summons, he paid little heed to the Stone Giant and Fire Bird, determined to finish Yang Kai.

Boom…

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar slammed into Yin Lesheng and a wild force struck him; only then did he realize he had underestimated the Stone Giant's strength. Even with the Huangquan Nether Veil protecting him he was staggered and nearly fell. Under that ferocious power, even the Huangquan Nether Veil itself flashed wildly.
