## Chapter 1705 — Island Lord

Yang Kai floated down onto a lotus leaf and lifted his head to gaze ahead.

Only then did he have the leisure to size up the newcomer.

To his surprise, the man was a somewhat elderly fellow of middling years, short in stature; even standing upright, Yang Kai guessed he was about a head shorter than him. His face was as dark as a cauldron bottom, rivaling the black-faced Yan Pei of Jubao Tower; perhaps because his treasure had been taken by Yang Kai, his already dark visage grew even darker.

He wore a crude garment made from some kind of sea-beast skin, threadbare and ragged; patches of raised muscle were exposed, full of explosive force and drawing attention.

One could say that aside from being a bit short, the old man's body proportions were extremely well balanced—a direct display of formidable physical constitution.

The elder clearly had not expected Yang Kai to take his punch without losing ground; after landing he frowned slightly, then charged with even greater speed, roaring, "Brat, surrender your life—today it's either you die or I do!"

Yang Kai had already harvested two thirds of the Huntian Lotus; this was almost worse than costing him his life—how could he readily let Yang Kai go?

If possible, Yang Kai wouldn’t have wanted to fight someone like this over a misunderstanding. But from the old man’s tone and expression, it was clear there’d be no peaceful end to this. Moreover, it was rare for him to encounter such a worthy opponent — his battle spirit was stirred, and instead of backing down, he charged forward with a hearty laugh.

In midair the two figures met and separated, and only after a long moment did a fierce sound reverberate.

In their second clash the two still could not decide a victor; neither gained the advantage. With no time to catch their breath, they threw themselves at one another again.

The little dolphin hid within the island lake, looking up with worry filling its eyes.

Boom, boom, boom...

Explosions kept ringing across the islet as Yang Kai and the elder gradually shifted the battlefield outward to avoid affecting the sea lotuses in the lake.

On this point they shared the same concern; neither wished to destroy those precious refining materials.

After about the time it took to drink a cup of tea, the battlefield had been moved out to the open sea.

Yang Kai no longer held back; his eyes brightened as he pushed his bodily power to the limit and tangled with the unnamed elder, fists and feet colliding.

This brutal style of combat gave him a thrill he had never before experienced. He laughed loudly, paying no heed to his injuries, as if resolved to fight the elder to the death.

There was not a sign of defeat!

The elder's expression grew grave; he was inwardly astonished.

He had dwelt on Ghost Isle for hundreds of years and long knew which path of cultivation was necessary to survive there. He had thought his mastery of the body was profound—enough to rank among the top within the Star Domain—yet he did not expect a suddenly appearing youth to be able to contend with him so fiercely.

This youth's physical constitution was in no way inferior to his own!

The sound of bones repeatedly cracking rang out, and blood spattered.

The elder was astonished to find the youth's blood was not red but golden.

That golden blood carried qi-and-blood power and energy fluctuations that left him agape; it seemed comparable to the most precious divine materials!

"Brat, your luck has run out!" the elder's eyes became fierce; with a flip of his wrist an iron-hammer-shaped secret treasure appeared in his palm. Seizing the pause while Yang Kai had blocked a punch, he swung it down hard toward Yang Kai's forehead.

Although unable to employ Saint Yuan and thus unable to unleash the secret treasure's full might, with the elder's enormous strength swinging it that iron hammer alone was enough to split heaven and earth.

If it landed, Yang Kai's skull would assuredly be smashed to paste.

Yang Kai had not expected the old man to be so sly; seeing the hammer draw near his pupils narrowed and he hastily tilted his head aside. At the same time his body suddenly bloomed with multicolored radiance.

The radiance flowed, and gradually an earth-yellow light dominated, coating Yang Kai's exterior.

The Undying Five Elements Sword—earth sword qi!

Yang Kai's earth sword qi drew its energy from Dayan Divine Sand; this rare Void King-Grade material itself possessed extremely high defensive properties.

Under Yang Kai's Divine Sense the earth sword qi quickly condensed into a shield and stood before the iron hammer.

Rumble...

The earth-yellow energy shield was blasted apart and the iron hammer struck Yang Kai's shoulder. His body dipped slightly, but he recovered the next moment. Grinning fiercely, he crouched low, breached the elder's defensive ring, and thrust both hands up forcefully.

The elder let out an anguished cry and hastily retreated, yet still could not avoid such a desperate counterattack.

His chin was caught in Yang Kai's hands and his head jerked back; if not for his strong physical cultivation, that blow alone would have sent him to the Yellow Springs.

Even so, the elder saw stars and nearly fainted.

Staggering, he retreated about a dozen zhang; before he could steady himself he glanced at Yang Kai with abject fear and then fled swiftly!

Yang Kai frowned and remained where he was, not giving chase; only after the elder's figure vanished from sight did he roll his shoulder that had been struck by the hammer.

A series of cracking sounds arose as misaligned bones reset.

"That old man..." Yang Kai pondered; from beginning to end he had neither the time nor the leisure to ask what the elder's background was or why he would dwell so far from Ghost Isle.

The little dolphin called from the island lake; Yang Kai turned and found it watching him with worried eyes, as if concerned whether he had been hurt.

Yang Kai gave it a reassuring look, then ambled over.

One third of the sea lotuses in the island lake remained unharvested, and Yang Kai certainly did not intend to leave them.

The elder had called those sea lotuses Huntian Lotus; Yang Kai was certain he had never heard of them before. As he had suspected, the Huntian Lotus was a Ghost Isle specialty, circulating only within Ghost Isle—no one could carry them outside.

After a while Yang Kai had collected all of the Huntian Lotus.

He looked up with a certain feeling and noticed the elder standing on a hillhead several li away, his face full of sorrow and indignation as he watched helplessly.

The feeling was like seeing a woman one had cherished easily have her heart won by another man.

Yang Kai grinned at him.

The elder nearly burst with anger; he turned and swept his sleeves as he left!

He could not best Yang Kai; rather than humiliate himself, better to avoid seeing it.

Yang Kai found a crude wooden hut nearby, doubtless erected by the elder.

He brazenly moved in.

Three days later, while Yang Kai was studying the medicinal properties of the Huntian Lotus and that body-tempering pill, hoping to refine it to perfection, faint footsteps suddenly sounded outside the wooden hut.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, set aside his work, and waited quietly.

After a moment the hut door opened and the elder stood outside, face ashen, some ten-odd zhang from Yang Kai, regarding him with a complex gaze. After a long while he said in a low voice, "You aren't one of Ming Yue's people?"

Yang Kai frowned and countered, "Who is Ming Yue?"

Astonishment crossed the elder's face; he studied Yang Kai carefully, as if testing whether he were lying.

Yang Kai's eyes were clear as he returned the inquiring look.

The elder inwardly nodded, his attitude softening somewhat—no longer the fury of a man who had lost kin—and slowly said, "You don't know Ming Yue? It seems you've only recently come to Ghost Isle?"

"Elder, you are perceptive!" Yang Kai replied lightly. "You're right—I arrived here about a month ago."

"No wonder..." The elder forced an ugly smile. "Since you aren't Ming Yue's, then we can speak properly."

"That's what I intended," Yang Kai smiled faintly; otherwise he would not have stayed on the islet.

He knew little of Ghost Isle and could not penetrate its interior to investigate. Having finally met a living local who had clearly lived here for many years, he naturally intended to make use of him.

"May I come in and speak?" the elder asked, somewhat vexed.

"Of course—this is your abode!" Yang Kai invited casually.

The old man’s mouth twitched, but he showed little fear. Though he knew he likely wasn’t Yang Kai’s match, he was confident that if it came down to a fight for his life, he could still escape from Yang Kai’s grasp.

He trusted Yang Kai would not be foolish enough to fight to the death with him.

Once the elder sat opposite him, Yang Kai asked, "Who exactly is this Ming Yue you mentioned?"

The elder snorted, "A blasted thief!"

Yang Kai was taken aback, thinking the old man must hold a deep grudge against Ming Yue; otherwise he would not grind his teeth at the name.

"He is the current island master of Ghost Isle!" the elder added.

"Ming Yue is the island master?" Yang Kai arched an eyebrow; when he had first come to Ghost Isle he had heard mention of an island master, but he had not expected to learn the island master's name here.

"That's right!"

Yang Kai's eyes shifted and he asked with a smile, "You say he is the current island master—were there island masters before him?"

The elder looked at Yang Kai in surprise and inwardly admired his sharpness, then proudly declared, "I was the previous island master!"

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned before clasping his fists and saying, “My apologies for the discourtesy!”

“Hmph, just a beaten dog, nothing more,” the old man said with unfeigned self-mockery, accepting the insult without protest. “Now I can only skulk here, clinging to life — what’s there to be respectful about? Besides, I was defeated by your hand!”

"Pure luck!" Yang Kai said modestly.

The elder no longer dwelt on the matter and stared intently at Yang Kai: "Have you cultivated an extremely profound body-refining method?"
