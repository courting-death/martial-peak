## Chapter 2484 — Always Competing With Me

The daughter of the Beast Great Emperor held such a lofty status that even many Emperor Realm experts would treat her with utmost respect. Yet Yang Kai actually dared to put his arm around her. If word of this reached the Beast Great Emperor, even if Yang Kai fled to the ends of the earth, he would be torn to pieces.

Not to mention the Beast Great Emperor, even that princess herself, having been so rudely handled by a man, would hardly let the matter rest.

That brat was dead for sure!

However, Xiao Chen quickly noticed in surprise that after Yang Kai put his arm around the princess, she didn’t resist at all. Instead, she reached out and wrapped her own arms around Yang Kai’s neck, pressing her delicate body tightly against his.

Xiao Chen's eyes flashed with envy.

Was there really such good fortune in this world?

As if possessed, Xiao Chen grinned, showing a gentle smile. He quickly moved closer to Lan Xun, spreading his broad arms to embrace her.

But just as he got close to Lan Xun and before he could make a move, Lan Xun suddenly spun around and sent her pink fist flying at him.

With a thud, even though Xiao Chen had already reached the Emperor Realm, he took the punch square on the nose. He didn’t dare use any strength to defend, so stars danced before his eyes and his head spun.

“What are you doing?” Lan Xun looked at him coldly, her face full of displeasure.

“Nothing, nothing…” Xiao Chen stood there awkwardly, two streams of blood running down to his lips.

On the other side, after Yang Kai had put enough distance between himself, Mo Xiaoqi, and Lan Xun, he finally felt the astonishing softness pressed against his chest.

He couldn’t help but blush a little. He patted Mo Xiaoqi, who was clinging to him, on the back and said, “Alright, alright, get down first so we can talk. People will laugh if they see this.”

Hearing this, Mo Xiaoqi realized something was off. She quickly jumped down from Yang Kai, her face slightly red. “Eldest Brother Yang, it really is you!”

Yang Kai chuckled, looking her up and down. “It’s been a few years, you’ve grown a lot.”

Mo Xiaoqi wrinkled her nose. “Pervert!”

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. “I meant you’ve gotten taller. What are you thinking?”

Only then did Mo Xiaoqi seriously look Yang Kai over and nod. “Eldest Brother Yang, you’ve become much stronger too.”

Back when she left Fenglin City, Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Now, seeing him again, he was already at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. For a cultivator with no Sect or backing, such growth was truly astonishing.

Mo Xiaoqi herself had made such great progress only because her circumstances were different from others.

With the Beast Great Emperor personally guiding her, Aunt Feng overseeing her cultivation, and the endless resources of the Spirit Beast Island, it would have been strange if she hadn’t grown.

As they spoke, Liu Yan and Zhang Ruoxi also flew over from the other side.

Mo Xiaoqi smiled and said, “When I first entered the Shattered Star Sea, I thought I’d run into Eldest Brother Yang, but I searched for over two years and never found you. It wasn’t until I met Sister Liu Yan not long ago that I learned you were really here.”

Liu Yan knew Mo Xiaoqi. The two girls had met in Fenglin City. Back then, Liu Yan was still an Artifact Spirit. Although she was very different from now, her aura hadn’t changed much. So when they met again, Mo Xiaoqi quickly recognized her.

After that, they traveled together to this Origin Sea, and the rest Yang Kai already knew.

Yang Kai quietly glanced over at Lan Xun and asked, “Xiaoqi, why did you end up fighting with Princess Lan Xun?”

Mo Xiaoqi glared over there unhappily and snorted, “Old grudges.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “You two are so young. What old grudges could you possibly have?”

Mo Xiaoqi and Lan Xun both had powerful Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivation, but in terms of age, they were really quite young. At most, they were just over twenty. To have such cultivation at that age was something only the descendants of Great Emperors could achieve.

“How could there not be? When she visited Spirit Beast Island with Lord Radiant Moon as a child, she snatched away one of my prettiest dresses.”

“That’s it?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened.

“That was my favorite dress! Aunt Feng made it for me herself. I cried for days.” Mo Xiaoqi protested, aggrieved.

Yang Kai looked helpless, thinking he really didn’t understand how girls thought.

As they spoke, Lan Xun and Xiao Chen also walked over slowly. When they were close, Lan Xun looked at Mo Xiaoqi with a smile and said, “Sister Xiaoqi, do you want to keep fighting?”

Mo Xiaoqi glared at her. “If you want to fight, I’ll go along. Who’s afraid of you?”

Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes flashed as she smiled. “Looks like you’re still not convinced!”

Mo Xiaoqi snorted, “You talk like you actually won. So thick-skinned.”

Lan Xun said, “Didn’t I? I beat you by half a move…”

Mo Xiaoqi’s face turned bright red. She gritted her teeth. “You’re older than me! When I’m your age, I definitely won’t lose to you!”

The smile on Lan Xun’s face vanished, and the temperature in the air seemed to plummet, a chill piercing to the bone.

Yang Kai and Xiao Chen both shivered, realizing things were about to go wrong.

Although Mo Xiaoqi and Lan Xun were about the same age, Lan Xun was probably two or three years older. That small difference didn’t really matter, but Mo Xiaoqi’s use of the word “old” clearly touched a nerve.

The two girls, who had just stopped fighting, now glared at each other again. Sparks seemed to fly in the air, and another battle was about to erupt.

Yang Kai looked at Xiao Chen, signaling him with his eyes.

Xiao Chen sniffed, wiped the blood under his nose, and looked away.

Useless! Yang Kai cursed inwardly. He could only brace himself and step forward, smiling, “Alright, alright, you’ve already fought. Don’t be so petty. You two were childhood friends—this friendship is precious. Come on, shake hands and be friends again.”

“Who’s friends with her!” both girls snapped through gritted teeth.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and said, “Even if you’re not good friends, there’s no need to fight like this. Girls should be more reserved—what kind of behavior is it to always be throwing punches and grabbing at each other?”

Mo Xiaoqi pouted, looking very unhappy.

Lan Xun’s eyes turned, and suddenly she became radiant. She smiled sweetly and said, “Senior Brother Yang is right. It was my fault for arguing with my little sister. Xiaoqi, don’t be angry. I apologize.”

“Hmph!” Mo Xiaoqi turned her head away, clearly not wanting to talk to her.

Lan Xun didn’t mind. She smiled at Yang Kai and said, “Senior Brother Yang, I didn’t expect you to know Xiaoqi. She usually lives in the Eastern Territory, and I only met her once as a child. How did you two meet?”

Who knew why this girl was asking, but Yang Kai felt a sense of danger and could only laugh it off. “Just a coincidence, nothing special.”

Mo Xiaoqi glared at Lan Xun warily. “You old woman, are you interested in my Eldest Brother Yang? Why are you asking so much?”

At these words, Zhang Ruoxi couldn’t help but gasp, covering her mouth. Lan Xun’s face reddened, her brows knitting, while Liu Yan looked unconcerned.

Lan Xun said, “This little girl really has no filter. She dares to say anything.”

Mo Xiaoqi made a face at her. “If you’re innocent, why are you so nervous?”

Lan Xun was speechless. She was just curious how Yang Kai knew Mo Xiaoqi, and their relationship seemed so close. She hadn’t expected to be teased like this and found herself at a loss.

Annoyed, she bit her silver teeth and said, “That’s right, I do like your Eldest Brother Yang. I’m planning to take him home to meet my father, so he can have a good son-in-law. Do you have any objections?”

Now it was Mo Xiaoqi’s turn to be dumbfounded. She stared at Lan Xun, then at Yang Kai, and suddenly stomped her foot. “You wicked woman! You’re always competing with me. You stole my dress when we were kids, and now you want to steal my Eldest Brother Yang!”

As she spoke, she grabbed Yang Kai’s arm, not caring at all that her ample chest was squashed against it. She gritted her teeth and declared, “If you try to take him, I’ll fight you to the end!”

Lan Xun burst out laughing, her body shaking with mirth. “That depends on which one your Eldest Brother Yang likes more—does he prefer a willful, unreasonable little girl like you, or a gentle, understanding woman like me?”

As she spoke, who knew what secret art she used, but her whole being suddenly radiated an extremely captivating aura.

Xiao Chen stood off to the side, swallowing hard, his eyes glued to Lan Xun as if he wished he could pluck them out and stick them right onto her.

Mo Xiaoqi’s face turned red with anxiety. She clung tightly to Yang Kai’s arm, as if she’d never let go, and snapped, “What’s so great about you? Aunt Feng is a thousand times prettier than you!”

“Senior Jiu Feng?” Lan Xun’s expression suddenly became serious.

Mo Xiaoqi lifted her chin proudly. “That’s right. Can you compare to Aunt Feng?”

She snorted, then turned to Yang Kai. “Eldest Brother Yang, don’t pay attention to this old woman. If you want to see beautiful women, come to the Spirit Beast Island someday. I’ll introduce Aunt Feng to you!”

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. He had no idea how to respond.

Lan Xun looked at Mo Xiaoqi in astonishment. Hearing her, she didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She knew this girl had lived on Spirit Beast Island all her life, protected by those elders, and didn’t understand anything about men and women. Her attachment to Yang Kai was probably just a reflex to compete with her.

Why was she even competing with her? Lan Xun suddenly felt it was all meaningless. She nodded. “Compared to Senior Jiu Feng, I’m certainly not as good. Alright, Xiaoqi, you win this time.”

Mo Xiaoqi immediately beamed with joy. “You’re not bad either, though you’re still a little worse than me!”

Lan Xun could only smile wryly and shake her head.
