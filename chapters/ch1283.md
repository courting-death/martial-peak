## Chapter 1283 — Bewildering Seduction Array

Hearing Yang Kai's words, Yin Sudie gave a light, amused chuckle and parted her red lips: "Young Brother, don't be in such a hurry to leave. I came expressly to invite you to Wanren Peak for a visit. I'm quite curious about your relationship with Senior Sister Daiyuan; if you would indulge me, please spare me a little face and come along. You know Senior Sister Daiyuan does not converse with others in the sect, so a Junior Sister like me finding a moment to speak with her is no easy matter. You are the first guest she has invited back in over twenty years — I'm curious, Master even asked about it. In truth, I came on Master’s orders."

"Your Master?" Yang Kai smiled faintly at Yin Sudie, musing for a moment before saying, "I'm honored that Elder Gong thinks highly of me, but I have pressing matters right now and truly cannot spare the time. How about this — when I have a chance, I'll visit Liuli Gate and pay my respects later?"

"When... who knows when 'later' will be? Better to strike while the iron's hot — today will do." Yin Sudie would not relent, instantly making the decision for Yang Kai as if it were not open to argument.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; her persistence naturally displeased him. It was plain this matter could not be resolved peacefully today. The more he thought about it, the more foolish he felt — since she had chased him this far, she had no intention of simply letting him go.

He drew a soft breath and asked in a low voice, "What if I insist on not going?"

"Not going?" Yin Sudie giggled coquettishly, appraising Yang Kai with interest, her breath like orchids as she said, "That won't be up to you, I fear."

No sooner had she finished than Yang Yan, a hundred zhang away from Yang Kai, suddenly cried out as if struck by a surprise attack.

Yang Kai's expression chilled and he quickly turned his head to look.

There, where no one had been before, stood a male martial artist radiating a pearly white glow. He had clearly attempted to seize Yang Yan but, for some unknown reason, had failed; instead he had been forced back by one of Yang Yan's Secret Treasures. Now he stood with brows tightly knit, one hand held out as if to grab the air, locked in a struggle against a layer of crimson flowing light that emanated from Yang Yan.

Yang Kai's eyelids contracted; he instantly recognized the warrior as the same man who had accompanied Yin Sudie.

He hastily turned to look behind Yin Sudie. There was no trace of the man—only a lingering streak of luminous glow dissipating into the air.

Yang Kai's face drained of color, his features hardening as if forged of iron!

He had no idea when the man had slipped away from Yin Sudie's side. The secret art used to ambush Yang Yan was clearly unusual; even he had been deceived.

One could imagine that if Yang Yan had not been wearing the chaotic Secret Treasure she had crafted herself, once seized she would have been completely at the other's mercy. Then, whether he liked it or not, Yang Kai would have been forced to go along with Yin Sudie.

Realizing he had fallen into their trap, Yang Kai's anger flared. He ignored the commotion around Yang Yan and instead regarded Yin Sudie coldly, his eyes flashing like a drawn blade.

Yang Yan wore a dazzling array of Secret Treasures; though Yang Kai did not know exactly how many, he was certain she would not be so easily captured by a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm martial artist.

Even an ordinary Origin Returning Realm cultivator would not necessarily be able to catch Yang Yan. He had absolute confidence in her ability to protect herself.

The instant the martial artist surnamed Luo moved to strike Yang Yan, Yin Sudie struck at Yang Kai. With a clear, bell‑like giggle, the pink mist that had appeared earlier reared up again, forming a vast pink barrier of fog that instantly wrapped tightly around Yang Kai.

Yin Sudie opened her lips and exhaled a breath of fragrance into the fog. The pink barrier immediately writhed and rolled as if alive, and within that rolling haze came wave after wave of intoxicating, soul‑stealing giggles threaded with lascivious undertones.

The sounds reached Hou's ears standing awkwardly behind Yin Sudie, his wounds still showing. His face flushed crimson, his blood rushing, eyes burning with a feverish stare fixed on Yin Sudie as she performed her seductive art; his gaze was filled with desire to possess.

As if sensing his burning stare, Yin Sudie frowned and turned, delivering a single palm to the crown of his head. Hou was startled; the clouded look that had nearly blinded him cleared significantly.

"Pull yourself together; don't be so shamefully obvious!" Yin Sudie scolded with displeasure. Hou's face reddened further, almost as if he might bleed.

He had made a fool of himself multiple times today and might never again hold his head high before Yin Sudie. This seductive art had not even been directed at him; with his current injuries, his Saint Yuan was unstable and his emotions volatile, so he had slipped and made a spectacle of himself.

Hearing her rebuke, Hou felt as if needles had pricked his skin; he longed to return to Liuli Gate this instant and go into seclusion.

"I will still need Senior Brother Hou's aid later, so sit and recover for now," Yin Sudie said, seeing his embarrassment, and added the instruction hurriedly.

At her words, a hard light flashed in the burly man's eyes. He stifled his shame, nodded decisively, settled into a cross‑legged posture and produced several pills from his Spatial Ring. He swallowed one of each, then took two Upper‑Level Saint Crystals into his palms and silently circulated his cultivation to recover.

A satisfied expression crossed Yin Sudie's face as she waved her hand, sending wave after wave of pink energy into the fog, augmenting the seduction's potency.

Inside the pink barrier, Yang Kai stood motionless and glanced around. The place where he stood had undergone a dramatic change: what had been wilderness had become a scene of indulgence and debauchery.

Before him was a vast pool whose waters were crystal clear; the scent of strong wine rose from it, intoxicating the nose and making one feel as if floating to paradise and unable to return.

On the pool's edge more than twenty young maidens, neatly dressed, danced in graceful steps. Each had a supple waist and alluring figure, strikingly beautiful in their own way — some burning with ardor, cheeks tinged with shyness as they stared directly into Yang Kai's eyes, lips parting as if to speak but holding back, overflowing with unsaid emotion.

Others were chillingly aloof, their temperaments ethereal and untouchable, like goddesses high above.

Some wore a lascivious expression and, as they twined and shifted, displayed their every delight — their rounded breasts trembling, astonishingly elastic; full hips and abundant flesh left the eye unable to rest.

Others bore a shy, pleasing look, like unripe green fruit, stirring one's desires with the slightest glance.

From the empty space around came soft, lingering music that matched the girls' dance, conjuring a scene of moonlit trysts and lovers' embraces that made one involuntarily recall a loved one and their countless shared moments, making the thought of leaving this pool of wine and flesh unbearable.

Yang Kai, however, stood in place and regarded everything with a cold, indifferent gaze; no matter how the maidens danced, he remained unmoved.

After the last attempt to ensnare Yang Kai with seductive arts had failed, one would think Yin Sudie would have learned her lesson — yet she returned with renewed effort. One could not help but wonder at her insistence.

There was, however, a distinct craft to this seduction. Any ordinary Saint King Realm cultivator would be thrown into chaos, but Yang Kai's Divine Sense was incomparably strong; he had been targeted by seductive arts many times and had abundant experience. He could see the illusions' flaws everywhere and they could not shake his spirit.

It seemed Yin Sudie noticed he was unmoved. After a moment, she adjusted something unseen, and the pink fog rolled anew. The twenty‑odd maidens who had been merrily dancing suddenly changed expressions in unison, growing sorrowful and desolate; the music in the surrounding void dropped a tone, rich with plaintive melancholy.

With that change in melody, the maidens all took on the mien of lonely housewives guarding their boudoirs, their wants unsated.

The garments they wore, once neat, became instantly thin as gauze, clinging to their exquisite forms and revealing every loveliness concealed within: breasts high and proud, flat abdomens, and between their thighs the gleaming, fragrant meadow of flesh — everything as if within reach should Yang Kai so wish.

This temptation rose a whole level beyond the previous moonlit idyll.

Yang Kai twitched a brow and suddenly grinned. Having planned to act immediately, he instead withdrew his Saint Yuan and adopted the air of a spectator eager to see to what lengths Yin Sudie's art would go.

Half a teacup later the pink fog swelled once more as Yin Sudie pushed her seductive art to a third degree.

After the fog stilled, the once‑sorrowful maidens were now completely naked, their bodies slick and exposed. They coiled together like water‑snakes, casting their charms open in pairs or small groups — tongues entwined in mouths, fragrant juices flowing, arms embracing tender flesh, legs entangling, jade hands roaming over soft skin, touching what ought and ought not be touched. Before Yang Kai's eyes they enacted the most licentious of acts.

Yang Kai's eyes nearly bulged in amazement as he watched with keen interest.

It was the first time he had seen such a spectacle. Though he knew it to be mere illusion, the visual impact was undeniable; at the very least his body reacted — his blood quickened noticeably.

"Not bad, not bad!" Yang Kai inclined his head slightly, pleased.

He had made the right choice in not immediately dispelling the seductive art; at least scenes like this were not encountered every day.

A cold snort sounded, as if Yin Sudie had been shamed and angered. In the next breath the writhing maidens exuded pink auras, their faces turning poisonous and malevolent, as if each had become a scorned, venomous woman staring dead at Yang Kai — twenty pairs of beautiful eyes now flashing with a chilling light.
