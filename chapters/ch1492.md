## Chapter 1492 — A Person's Name

The last time the Imperial Garden opened, because it was constrained by the Imperial Jade, the number of cultivators who could enter was also limited. This time was different. There is not the slightest danger within the Fallen Emperor Mountains, and anyone may delve deep, so basically all cultivators who received the news have come.

And those gathered around the ruins of this ancient Sect are far more than just the major Sects and great forces.

Many cultivators from small families and small Sects are also here, hoping to trail behind those experts and sip some broth. However, they also do not dare to get too close, for fear of inviting a calamity of slaughter; after all, they have no qualifications to stand as equals with the experts of those Sects.

At this very moment, at least several hundred Origin Returning Realm cultivators from different powers were madly bombarding the sect‑protecting grand array before them. The might of various secret arts and Secret Treasures interwove, multicolored radiance flashed, and from time to time layers of ripples surged through the air, yet the Protective Mountain Array before the ruins of this ancient Sect was incomparably solid. Even after a dozen to twenty days of assaults, it still barred the way ahead, allowing no one to go deeper within.

However, the many experts of Dark Star have not been without gains. After such a long grind, the Protective Mountain Array before them was already tottering; it looked like it would not be long before it was broken.

Most people were desperately attacking the array, while some experts formed teams to drive away the cultivators who had rushed here upon hearing the news. The experts in these teams were composed of cultivators from different Sects. In order to guarantee the interests and harvests of their own Sects, they naturally would not allow unrelated people to fish in troubled waters before the grand array was breached; after all, they had spent so much time and effort to break it.

But if there are those who resist—kill without mercy!

Many who did not understand the inside story had already died miserably at these people’s hands. The overturned cart serves as a lesson for those behind; when subsequent cultivators arriving upon the news saw those corpses, they all voluntarily stopped on the outer perimeter, not daring to rashly press in.

The ruins of an ancient Sect may be enticing, but one must be alive to go in and explore.

Those of low birth and weak strength could only stay as far as ten li away, staring longingly ahead. To say they felt no envy was impossible; they, too, wished to take part, but alas their own Sects held no standing and their own strength was insufficient—truly, they did not have the qualifications.

“Tsk, tsk. Almost every Sect with a name and a face on all of Dark Star has shown up. This is truly a grand event.” In the onlooking crowd, a bald, burly man swayed his head as he spoke. Though he sounded admiring, anyone could hear the trace of sourness in his tone.

“Ignorant fool who has never seen the world!” Hearing him, another sackcloth‑clad elder standing not far to his side snorted coldly. “Do you think Dark Star only has this few masters? The major Sects and great forces that have come amount to at most only half. The news has not fully spread yet; otherwise, there would only be more experts.”

“You old bastard, looking for trouble, are you? I’ll say whatever the hell I want—what’s it to you?” The bald brute was already irritated at being stopped outside, and now that someone dared to talk back, his temper flared instantly.

The sackcloth elder merely cast him a cool glance, mockery on his face, with no intention of trading barbs.

Who knew that this disdainful look only enraged the bald man further. His expression turned vicious, and just as he was about to lay hands on the sackcloth elder, his vision suddenly blurred and a youth eerily appeared in front of him.

The youth’s figure was tall and stalwart, clad in a light‑blue close‑fitting outfit, appearing exceptionally crisp and capable.

The bald man was taken aback. Staring at the youth’s back, he was slightly lost in thought, doubt flashing in his eyes. He vaguely felt this person looked familiar, but for a moment could not recall where he had seen him.

“So many people?” The youth took a look ahead and let out a low exclamation of surprise.

The bald man answered casually, “Of course there are many. They’re all hoping to get in and find some good things. Friend, where are you coming from?”

Hearing the question, the youth turned back and smiled, “Came in from outside. Only heard the news not long ago. Mm, I’ll go on ahead first.”

Saying so, he shot into the air and rushed straight toward that side.

“Young friend, stay!” The sackcloth elder who had been bickering with the bald man changed expression and hurriedly called out to stop him, but his shout was already late. The other was already a hundred zhang away; such speed left people clicking their tongues.

“This brat is finished!” The sackcloth elder shook his head slightly, pity on his face. He judged the youth young in years yet not weak in cultivation, but to dare dash toward the front of the Protective Mountain Array now—he would surely be slain on the spot.

“Not necessarily. He might just get through.” The bald man’s eyes lit up; he finally remembered where he had seen that youth.

The last time someone caused a huge commotion in Tianyun City, the bald man had been in Tianyun City purchasing items and had seen this person once. Later he learned that this youth was actually Yang Kai, master of Dragon Lair Mountain. After stirring up Tianyun City, he not only came to no harm, he even wandered carefree.

Now, he was already the Sect Master of the Lingxiao Sect—the very figure who took over Flowing Flame Sandland!

“What do you mean?” The sackcloth elder looked at the bald man in puzzlement. “Previously, others also tried to rush over there to fish in troubled waters, but every single one who dared died. Their corpses are displayed there to warn the rest. Why do you think he can pass safely?”

“Heh heh, just watch. If he passes, old fellow, you’ll apologize to me.” The bald man wore a face full of certainty.

“And if he is killed?” The sackcloth elder’s eyelids narrowed.

“I’ll kneel and lick your shoes!” the bald man barked fiercely.

At those words, everyone nearby looked over with amused expressions. Even the sackcloth elder was stunned.

What an astonishing wager! As the saying goes, a man’s face is like a tree’s bark—if he really lost, this would be worse than killing him. Was the other truly this confident?

“Good. This old man will take your bet.” The sackcloth elder was also a decisive sort. After only a brief ponder, he immediately agreed. He simply did not believe that, under such circumstances, those great forces attacking the array would be so accommodating as to allow a youth to enter.

For a time, all the surrounding cultivators fixed their gazes on Yang Kai, wanting to see whether he could safely pass the obstruction of that team jointly formed by experts of the various great Sects.

Yang Kai also very quickly sensed something was wrong.

Although he had contacted Qian Tong via Transmission Compass and knew the general situation here, he had not expected this kind of scene.

He had only just gone forward and had not yet reached the front of the Protective Mountain Array when a squad of seven or eight experts at the Origin Returning Realm flew over head‑on. Each was attired differently, clearly from different powers.

Of them, Yang Kai could recognize three.

Battle Sky Alliance, Leitai Sect, Piaomiao Hall!

Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect need no explanation—they are the two giants on Dark Star. Piaomiao Hall’s strength is also not to be insulted. Its standing is on par with Yingyue Hall and Liuli Sect; on Dark Star, all are first‑line forces.

As for the other few, although Yang Kai could not tell their origins, each and every one was an expert at the Second or Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

These people stood in midair a hundred zhang away, coldly watching Yang Kai. A gray‑robed elder stepped out from the team without a word and pointed a finger at Yang Kai from afar. With that motion, a longsword leisurely appeared. With a slight tremor, that longsword turned into a streak of fiery‑red light and shot straight toward Yang Kai.

Its speed was as swift as a falling meteor.

Yang Kai’s face changed. Sensing the killing intent within the other’s move, he immediately summoned the Purple Shield to guard before him.

Boom…

The sword light collided with the Purple Shield, and a violent tide of energy swept out. Fiery‑red radiance completely enveloped Yang Kai, and his trace could no longer be seen.

The gray‑robed elder let out a cold laugh and hooked his finger. The fiery‑red sword light immediately flew back to him, once more becoming a longsword in his grasp, as he coldly watched in Yang Kai’s direction.

He thought Yang Kai was surely dead. In his perception, Yang Kai was merely a cultivator at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; there was simply no way he could withstand this sure‑kill strike of his.

But very soon, his brows knit and he let out a soft “Eh?”

Over there, the light dispersed and Yang Kai’s figure was revealed again, the Purple Shield guarding before him, actually without the slightest injury. Only, his expression was incomparably cold.

Who would be in a good mood when, upon just arriving, he was attacked by a stranger—and an attack carrying killing intent at that?

“What do you mean by that?” Yang Kai said coldly, his gaze fixed on the gray-robed elder.

“What do I mean?” The gray‑robed elder snorted. “Trespassers are to be killed without mercy. What do you think it means?”

Yang Kai frowned, his gaze drifting down to those mangled corpses below, faintly grasping the situation.

After his one strike proved fruitless, the gray‑robed elder felt his face had been lost. He was about to strike again to prove his strength when a low shout came from behind: “Wait!”

Hearing the voice, the gray‑robed elder indeed did not make another move, but turned to look at a white‑haired elder in his dotage, a slightly ingratiating smile on his face as he asked, “Brother Liang, what instruction do you have?”

The other did not answer, but instead gazed at Yang Kai with interest, an odd smile surfacing on his face as he called out loudly, “May I ask, Young Brother, are you Yang Kai, master of the Lingxiao Sect?”

Yang Kai lifted his eyes to him and nodded. “That’s right. I am Yang Kai.”

“What, this person is the Sect Master of the Lingxiao Sect?” The gray‑robed elder who had attacked Yang Kai earlier turned pale and cried out in shock.

In an instant, his heart was filled with boundless regret.

Regardless of Yang Kai’s personal cultivation, the Lingxiao Sect he now controls is not something anyone may belittle. Not to mention the sect’s Ancestral Treasure, the Void King‑Grade warship—just the rumors of Yang Kai’s ferocious combat power were enough to make the gray‑robed elder’s scalp go numb.

Rumor had it that when he was at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, he had already slain experts of the Origin Returning Realm. Now that he, too, has reached the Origin Returning Realm, his strength is likely in no way inferior to any cultivator at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

He himself was only at the Second Stage. If he truly crossed hands with him, he might very well slip and be killed.

The gray-robed elder was seized with terror, a chill running straight down his spine. He secretly thanked his luck that Elder Liang had intervened in time—otherwise, a grave mistake might have been made.

What is more, with the various resources now in the hands of the Lingxiao Sect, many Sects on Dark Star wish to befriend them, yet there has been no avenue to get in touch with the Lingxiao Sect.

The gray‑robed elder’s Sect had the same plan, but at this first meeting to make a move to kill—who knew whether Yang Kai would hold it against him.

Thinking of this, the gray‑robed elder became nervous to the extreme, his heart filled with unease.
