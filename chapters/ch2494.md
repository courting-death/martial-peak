## Chapter 2494 — Black Hole

The old man spoke as if he ruled the heavens, as though even Wen Zishan would obey his every command.

Yang Kai snorted, "You talk as if you’re the Mortal Great Emperor himself!"

Wen Zishan, Hall Master Wen, seemed to have been raised by the Mortal Great Emperor himself. If there was anyone in this world who could order him around, it would undoubtedly be the Mortal Great Emperor. But the Mortal Great Emperor was a man who treated life as a game, wandering the mortal world, coming and going without a trace, never settling anywhere. No one knew where he was, and there had been no news of him in the Star Realm for a long time.

The old man’s eyes widened in shock. “You know about that too?”

Yang Kai said disdainfully, “You really are full of yourself.”

Maybe this old swindler really was some extraordinary figure. He knew so many secrets, was acquainted with so many people, and even Yao Si treated him with such respect—he was definitely not an ordinary person.

But as for him being the Mortal Great Emperor, Yang Kai would never believe it.

For one simple reason—this was the Shattered Star Sea!

Only Dao Origin Realm cultivators could enter the Shattered Star Sea. Those in the Emperor Realm couldn’t get in at all. With the Mortal Great Emperor’s astonishing cultivation, it was impossible for him to come here. If he forced his way through the barrier, the Shattered Star Sea would become unstable and collapse.

The old man smiled faintly, ignoring Yang Kai, and instead turned to look at the remaining Dao Origin Realm cultivators. He sighed softly and said, “Men die for wealth, birds die for food.”

The reason these people stayed was obviously to try and get some benefits. Now that all the Emperor Realm cultivators had left, they had far fewer powerful competitors, so their emotions were running high and they were eager to try their luck.

After a moment’s thought, the old man said loudly, “You all stayed behind for the Spatial Ring. In that case... this old man will grant your wish.”

Everyone looked at him suspiciously, not knowing what this old fellow meant.

Just then, the old man suddenly moved with surprising speed, arriving directly in front of the black hole. No one knew what mysterious hand seals he formed, but his hand suddenly shone with light as he reached toward the black hole.

“What is that old guy doing?”

“Is he trying to take out the Spatial Ring?”

“Does he really have that kind of ability? Look, his hand really went in!”

“What’s inside? Wow, the light is so dazzling, I can’t see anything in there.”

A cacophony of noise erupted as everyone stared wide-eyed at the old man’s actions.

Yang Kai was especially shocked.

Ever since this black hole formed, he had clearly sensed spatial power fluctuations. In other words, there was a strange space inside the black hole, but it was extremely unstable. Even someone as skilled in space power as he was wouldn’t dare to enter recklessly.

He never expected the old man to actually reach his hand into that space.

Was he also skilled in space power? Yang Kai probed, but sensed no spatial fluctuations at all. After watching for a while, Yang Kai’s expression became odd.

After a short while, the old man suddenly gave a low shout and quickly withdrew his hand.

As the light faded, there was now an ancient-looking Spatial Ring in his hand.

The crowd erupted, their eyes burning as they stared at the ring. The sound of people swallowing filled the air.

Looking over, the skeletal hand in the black hole was now empty.

“He really took the ring out!”

“He can even do that?”

“That’s incredible. What’s inside the ring?”

“Old man, hand over the Spatial Ring, and we might spare your life!”

As soon as the old man took out the Spatial Ring, the crowd boiled over. While shouting, everyone quietly circulated their Origin Qi, ready to pounce at any moment.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and said, “Old man, you’ve really stirred up trouble this time. Let’s see how you get out of this!”

Although he was quite strong now, facing a thousand Dao Origin Realm cultivators still made him uneasy. If they all attacked at once, he’d have no choice but to run. The old man was unfathomable, but Yang Kai didn’t think he could take on a thousand at once.

The old man smiled faintly and said, “Their eyes are only on this ring. Since that’s the case, let them have it.”

“Let them have it?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Before he could react, the old man flicked his hand, tossing the Spatial Ring into the void and shouted, “If you want it, go get it yourself!”

No one knew what trick the old man used, but the Spatial Ring suddenly burst with light and shot off into the distance like a bolt of lightning.

“That old fool is crazy, he actually threw the ring away!”

“Just wait, once I get the Spatial Ring, I’ll settle the score with you!”

“What are you waiting for? Go after it! With that Spatial Ring, you could save yourself five hundred years of cultivation!”

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Beams of light burst forth as all the cultivators turned into streams of light, chasing after the Spatial Ring. In the blink of an eye, not a single one of the thousand remained—they all vanished.

Watching their retreating backs, the old man clicked his tongue and said, “If I’d known this trick worked so well, I wouldn’t have gone to so much trouble.”

Looking a bit annoyed, he turned to Yang Kai and said, “Kid, aren’t you going after it? That’s a Great Emperor’s Spatial Ring, filled with countless Imperial Treasures and miraculous Spiritual Pills. If you get it, becoming an Emperor will be within reach.”

His tone was full of temptation, clearly trying to get Yang Kai to leave as well.

Yang Kai sneered, “Old man, you said yourself that during the battle of the Great Emperors, everything except a few items was destroyed. There’s nothing good left in that ring, so why should I chase after it?” He paused, then smiled slyly. “Besides, the real Spatial Ring is still here. The one that flew off is just a fake. Why would I chase it?”

The old man stared at Yang Kai. “How did you see through it? My illusion shouldn’t be so easy to break!”

Yang Kai nodded, “Old man, your illusion is truly masterful. But... you never even put your hand into the black hole, so how could you have taken out the ring? Besides, that skeleton and ring look close, but who knows how far away they really are? It’s not something you can just reach out and grab. What looks close is just a spatial illusion.”

The old man exclaimed, “Sharp eyes! So, you’re staying here because you want the ring?”

Yang Kai said, “I just want to know what’s going on with Ruoxi’s bloodline power!”

“That I really can’t tell you. You’ll understand in time.”

For some reason, whenever Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline power was mentioned, the old man clammed up.

The old man suddenly said, “I have things I must do. You should leave this place at once—it’s truly dangerous here. Whether you live or die doesn’t matter much, but the two girls you’re carrying must not come to any harm!”

“Things to do? What things?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

But the old man was already charging straight toward the black hole, his expression solemn. Maybe it was Yang Kai’s imagination, but he thought he saw a trace of resolve and tragic determination in the old man’s eyes, as if he’d put life and death aside.

When he reached the black hole, he quickly formed hand seals and slapped toward it.

Ripples spread out from the front of the black hole, as if an invisible door had opened. The old man passed straight through and rushed into the black hole.

After the ripples faded, the old man’s figure disappeared, and the skeleton vanished as well. Looking around, only the black hole remained in place.

A strange power fluctuation came from the black hole, and Yang Kai found it somewhat familiar.

Yang Kai’s heart stirred, and he quickly took out a jade slip from his Spatial Ring.

This jade slip had been snatched from Wu Mengchuan by his Incarnation after killing him. According to the Incarnation, Wu Mengchuan had tried to destroy the jade slip before dying, so who knew what secrets it held.

There was a mysterious restriction on the jade slip. Yang Kai had tried to break it before, but couldn’t find a way in.

At this moment, Yang Kai was surprised to find that the power fluctuation from the black hole was exactly the same as the aura on the jade slip, as if left by the same person.

As soon as he took out the jade slip, it began to glow, and the restriction on it unlocked itself, resonating with the power from the black hole.

An incredibly strong suction force suddenly erupted from the black hole, trying to swallow him whole.

Yang Kai was shocked. His face changed wildly as he tried to leave.

But to his horror, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t move at all.

The black hole was like a beast’s open mouth, ready to swallow him in one bite.

After just a few breaths, Yang Kai was powerless to resist. Right before he was swallowed, he tossed the unconscious Zhang Ruoxi and Mo Xiaoqi into the Small Xuan Realm, and also put Liu Yan away.

As soon as he finished, everything went black. It felt like he was falling into a bottomless abyss, endlessly plummeting, with no light around and no end beneath his feet.

Who knew how long it lasted, but suddenly Yang Kai felt a sharp pain all over and his feet hit something solid. With a thud, he realized he had fallen into a strange world.

In this world, there were no sun, moon, or stars, and even the Spiritual Qi was extremely thin. The entire world was shrouded in a bizarre red hue.

Looking around, he saw crimson blood flowing across the ground beneath his feet. The blood was incredibly fresh, reeking of a strong bloody stench, and like countless streams merging into the sea, it was slowly converging in a certain direction.

All around, the land was littered with countless severed limbs and remains, flesh and blood everywhere—a terrifying sight.

“These are...” Yang Kai looked around, his face changing as he muttered, “The cultivators who died in the Origin Sea?”

The blood and remains he saw were clearly left by cultivators who had just died. All the corpses and body parts were fresh, with no signs of decay.

“They were all swallowed up and brought here!” Yang Kai’s expression was grim, full of disbelief.
