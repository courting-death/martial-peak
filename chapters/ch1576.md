## Chapter 1576 — A Paragon Among Pretty Faces

“Human, Lord Yu Xiong's temper isn't very good; if you want to live, quickly admit your mistake, apologize, kowtow and salute—maybe you can save your life!” A yao shouted, as if instructing Yang Kai how to act; after all, the charm of that Lord was obvious to all, and the human man's loss of composure wasn't entirely his fault.

“Admit my mistake, apologize, kowtow and salute…” Yang Kai stroked his chin with an air of reckless impudence, still locking eyes with the seductive woman, a mischievous smile playing at the corner of his mouth. “Beauty, are you sure you want me to do that?”

At those words, the entire hall fell into stunned silence.

Every gaze turned toward Yang Kai, faces full of disbelief.

This human… actually called that Lord a beauty? That was no longer mere rudeness; it was deliberate teasing, brazen provocation!

That Lady had been born human, but for special reasons had been taken in as an adopted daughter by the Lady Chi Yue, taught and cultivated over the years; her excellence was renowned, and even elite yao bowed and behaved cautiously and respectfully when they saw her.

A human, openly flirting with that Lady before everyone’s eyes? Has he never tasted death before?

“How dare you!” A yao expert barked, his face twisted with anger.

To tease that Lady was to insult the yao, to insult Lady Chi Yue!

No yao could tolerate Yang Kai's insolence; in an instant the hall filled with righteous fury and threads of murderous intent spread.

Yu Xiong blinked, seeming a little disoriented, then burst into loud laughter. Pointing at Yang Kai he turned to the seductive woman and said, “Little Sister, this pretty boy actually called you a beauty!”

“Am I not?” the seductive woman glanced at Yu Xiong with a faint look, her phoenix-like eyes narrowing slightly.

Yu Xiong's laughter choked off in his throat; he drew back his head and hurriedly said, “Of course I didn't mean it that way, it's just that I've never heard anyone call you that before, I was surprised. Hmm, this pretty boy is shameless—shall I teach him a lesson for you, Sister?”

Saying that, he glared viciously at Yang Kai.

In the Red Moon Domain, Yu Xiong was second to none; as an adopted son of Lady Chi Yue, his strength and status were beyond what ordinary yao could match.

His temperament was straightforward and bold; he feared nothing—only two people could make him bow.

One was naturally Lady Chi Yue, and the other was the seductive woman seated to his right.

If he respected Lady Chi Yue for reverence, then he admired this Little Sister; he admired her talent and her speed of cultivation—things he could never match.

Their adoptive mother had once said the Little Sister, aside from Ba He, was the most likely in the Red Moon Domain to ascend to the Void King Realm—that was something he could not compete with.

“No need!” the seductive woman refused Yu Xiong's offer.

“Just let him go? That's too easy for him; he must pay for his arrogance!” Yu Xiong wagged his big head, displeased.

The seductive woman smiled faintly, rose from her chair, and walked down gracefully. With a light laugh she said, “Let him go? Of course I won't be so merciful—such shameless, flirtatious types can't be let off easily. I'll personally teach him a lesson!”

“Uh… that works too,” Yu Xiong nodded, looking at Yang Kai with malicious delight, grinning: “Pretty boy, you're done for. If I strike you it'll be satisfying, but if Little Sister deals with you, heh heh heh…”

The yao experts arrayed on either side perked up when they heard the Lady would personally teach the pretty boy a lesson; they secretly anticipated the show.

Then again, to be chastised personally by the Lady—this pretty boy was indeed fortunate, and many yao revealed looks of envy.

In just a moment, the alluring woman arrived before Yang Kai. Her smooth, fair chin was still slightly raised, carrying an air of untouchable nobility. Her long, snow-white neck was exposed, a sight that made one’s head spin and heart stir.

Yang Kai was calm and unafraid, smiling as he met her gaze.

The woman lightly bit her silver teeth and slowly extended a hand, a jade finger jabbing at Yang Kai's chest.

Yu Xiong watched with glee, eagerly expecting his Little Sister to unleash some cruel, despicable torture on this shameless fellow…

The many yao craned their necks, full of anticipation.

The jade finger pressed at Yang Kai's chest as the seductive woman ground her teeth and said, “Tell me, should I dig your heart out, pull your liver free, or… slit you open to see whether what's inside you is black or white!”

“Do you hate me that much?” Yang Kai touched his nose.

“Yes!” the seductive woman's chin lifted a little more. “I hate you to my bones, I wish to tear you limb from limb, to grind your bones to dust…”

“Heh…” Yang Kai gave a dry chuckle.

As she spoke the jade finger tapped lightly at Yang Kai's chest; her silver teeth clicked as if she and Yang Kai bore some mortal grudge.

Excitement flickered across Yu Xiong's face as he watched Yang Kai's reaction closely.

Little Sister didn't seem to be using overly vicious methods, but with her ability it would be easy to inflict hidden injury on the pretty boy.

After a few jabs from Little Sister, Yu Xiong wondered whether the pretty boy's organs would turn to pus…

But… why did Little Sister's tone sound so plaintive? Yu Xiong scratched his head, puzzled.

“Stop it!” Yang Kai showed an exasperated look and grabbed the seductive woman's small hand; she tried to pull away but couldn't.

The gathered yao experts were instantly indignant, their eyes shooting fire.

How brazen! This fellow not only dared to tease the Lady, now he dared to touch her—how could they bear it?

They were about to rush forward to teach Yang Kai a lesson when they saw a flush of shyness color the Lady's face; her fair cheeks reddened, even her neck blushed, and at some point her lifted chin had lowered—her haughty air transformed in an instant into a gentle grace.

What was happening? Why would the Lady react like this?

The yao were dumbstruck.

“You bastard!” The seductive woman whispered, a wronged expression in her beautiful eyes. “Didn't I tell you I was in Di Chen? Why did you only come see me now?”

“I couldn't help it—the Star Domain voyage is long; I can't come whenever I please,” Yang Kai explained helplessly. “It's luck that I managed to make it this trip. I'm here now, Qingluo, don't be angry and make a spectacle.”

“They’ve been watching the spectacle for quite a while already.” Shan Qingluo shot Yang Kai a reproachful glance. “This is exactly how you wanted things to turn out, isn’t it? Are you satisfied now?”

“Heh.” Yang Kai grinned. “I didn't expect you to be the one to receive me and Little Senior Sister—your words wrong me.”

“If that's the case, I won't hold it against you.” Shan Qingluo snorted softly.

The two of them were all lovey-dovey and affectionate here, while the yao in the hall stared blankly.

By now they all understood that their Lady and this pretty boy seemed to have known each other for a long time and were very close—otherwise such flirtatious banter would never have occurred.

It was almost impossible for them to accept.

Yu Xiong was stunned too; his eyes nearly popped from their sockets.

He had never seen his Little Sister so genial with any man; when she spoke with that pretty boy she showed an expression of utter satisfaction and happiness!

Yu Xiong had seen Little Sister lonely and forlorn when she was by herself more than once, but now her contentment contrasted sharply with her previous melancholy.

“You seem to hold a high position here,” Yang Kai asked softly.

To tell the truth, seeing Shan Qingluo seated high above surprised him; though he already knew she had been adopted by Lady Chi Yue, he had assumed she would live a hard life among a different race—now that he saw her, he realized he had been mistaken.

“Mm, my adoptive mother values me highly, so the yao don't dare to be disrespectful,” Shan Qingluo answered softly.

“And that fellow over there—what's his status? He seems about the same as you.” Yang Kai glanced at Yu Xiong.

“He's like me—also taken in by our adoptive mother; nominally he's my Eldest Brother, though he is a true-blooded yao,” Shan Qingluo explained. After she spoke she noticed the faint hostility in Yang Kai's eyes vanish.

That discovery sent thrills through her heart.

She understood better than anyone what it meant for a man to be jealous for a woman.

“Hello, brother-in-law!” Yang Kai suddenly looked up and smiled at Yu Xiong, calling out loudly.

Yu Xiong's eyeballs seemed to drop into his shoes!

If his Little Sister's earlier intimacy with the pretty boy had already aroused Yu Xiong's suspicions, Yang Kai's address now confirmed them.

Little Sister and this pretty boy… were in that kind of relationship!

Could it be true? Yu Xiong stared at Shan Qingluo in disbelief, and found that Little Sister did not deny it; instead she blushed shyly and smiled.

Yu Xiong felt something shatter inside him, and when he glanced at the other yao in the hall he saw each face full of sorrow and fury, eyes burning as if they would transform into arrows to strike down the pretty boy on the spot.

“Uh…” Yu Xiong's mind boggled; he didn't know what to say to Yang Kai. He suddenly glanced at Xia Ningshang, who had been quietly standing by Yang Kai, and asked in a buzz, “And what is this young woman's relation to you?”

“Little Senior Sister is my woman!” Yang Kai smiled and put an arm around Xia Ningshang's waist, pulling Shan Qingluo in with his other arm.

Shan Qingluo struggled a little, but went along with Yang Kai, leaning shyly against him with a faint flush.

Yu Xiong gaped, foolishly staring at the human pretty boy who smiled so radiantly and kept both women close; a surge of admiration welled up and he emphatically gave a thumbs-up.

Now that's a winner in life! A paragon among pretty boys!
