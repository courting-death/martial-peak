## Chapter 752 — Watching with a Cold Eye

In the boundless white world, the temptations before them and the ready-made opportunities drew out the darker instincts of the Seven Families Alliance’s experts; without a word they burst into slaughter, and in an instant more than a dozen were slain.

Having tasted the gains, these people grew even more restless and covetous.

The outsiders fell silent for a moment before reacting; someone roared, “I saw through your ill intent long ago—brothers, fight them to the death!”

In an instant, the hundred-plus souls split into two great camps: the Seven Families Alliance on one side and the outsiders on the other, and within the Court of Divine Battle they engaged in life-or-death combat.

There were no Secret Treasures, no Martial Skills, and no corporeal bodies—what everyone could rely on were only the strength of their own Spirit Body and the Soul Techniques they had cultivated.

The two armies collided, and Spirit Bodies were shattered again and again, dissolving into streams of energy that nearby fighters absorbed.

After devouring others’ soul energy, these fighters grew inflamed with emotion and murderous intent; each seemed determined to monopolize the spoils and wipe out the rest.

The Seven Families Alliance’s warriors proved stronger on the whole; each family had one or two Transcendent Realm experts present, and with almost a single strike they could finish off an outsider.

Yet among the outsiders there were also a few Transcendent Realm figures; with their allies they managed to hold out for a time and inflicted nontrivial losses on the Seven Families Alliance.

Everyone fought with eyes reddened by bloodlust, and cries of agony kept disappearing into nothing.

The cruel, frenzied scene was almost unbearable to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saintess; she trembled and watched the melee as if in shock, failing even to notice someone approaching her.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, curious to see what skills the woman possessed, but he did not intervene—he merely watched with a cold eye.

Only when she sensed danger did the Saintess awaken from her daze, and a destructive force burst from that seemingly frail Spirit Body, utterly annihilating the approaching fighter’s spirit.

As the dying fighter’s residual soul energy lingered nearby, the Saintess’s brows knitted in distaste; unlike the others, she did not absorb it, instead stepping back with an expression of revulsion.

Yang Kai nodded inwardly—this woman had some ability, and she had the discernment to know that such easy gains carried hidden dangers.

Perhaps feeling Yang Kai’s observation, the Saintess stole a glance at him; her beautiful eyes went sharp with vigilance.

She didn’t know whether Yang Kai would, like the others, suddenly strike down those near him; if he did, she felt she had no means of resisting.

From Yang Kai she sensed a barely perceptible pressure, and especially a scorching aura that made her extremely wary.

Yang Kai, however, no longer focused on her; with keen interest he continued to appraise the melee over there, his expression indifferent.

The battle had become a rout: the outsiders were a scattered bunch and were forced to unite against the Seven Families Alliance’s assault; though they had initial successes, they quickly collapsed before the vast gap in strength.

After those Transcendent Realm fighters were slain, the remaining Divine Roaming Realm warriors could not stir up any resistance.

As their pitiful screams begged for mercy, the Seven Families Alliance’s experts turned a blind eye, grinning savagely as they shattered Spirit Bodies and reaped the benefits.

Gradually, from over a hundred people fewer than a dozen remained—and those survivors were all Transcendent Realm experts of the Seven Families Alliance.

It seemed that from devouring so much soul energy a flaw had finally surfaced; each of them grew agitated and deranged, and their Spirit Bodies exuded a chaotic, malevolent aura.

After a moment of mutual indifference, these dozen resumed fighting one another.

“What should we do, what should we do?” Yang Kai watched as the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saintess approached him for the third time, her face anxious and helpless—an expression that amused him.

“What do you mean, what should we do?” Yang Kai asked, feigning ignorance.

“What if they turn on us?” The Saintess’s feelings fluttered with fear; though she had a First Stage Transcendent Realm cultivation, so many members of the Seven Families Alliance remained—if they surged this way she could not hold them, so despite her misgivings about Yang Kai she had to try to bind her fate to his.

“You’re you, I’m me!” Yang Kai put up a finger and shook his head slowly, keenly aware of her intent.

“Aren’t you afraid you’ll die here?”

“Blessing or calamity—if it’s calamity you can’t dodge it by being afraid; does fear help?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, his indifferent air startling the Saintess; she examined him up and down as she spoke.

“What are you after?” the Saintess warned, hairs prickling at the malice she sensed in Yang Kai’s gaze. “Don’t forget I rescued you before—you ought to repay that debt.”

Yang Kai shrugged. “Don’t worry, I don’t intend to do anything to you. Don’t be so tense.”

The Saintess clearly did not fully trust him; her eyes widened as she stared straight into Yang Kai’s, as if trying to peer into his heart, then after a moment her expression relaxed.

She could sense that Yang Kai bore her no ill will, but he was certainly scheming something, and that made her uneasy.

She was filled with regret; had she known how dangerous this would be, she never would have come down to the sea floor, let alone use a trick to shake off two Sacred Land experts—she had practically dug her own grave.

The Saintess felt she wanted to cry but had no tears left.

Yang Kai ignored her and went back to watching the Divine Sense battle.

The dozen or so experts of the Seven Families Alliance all knew one another’s roots, so their fight was fierce; influenced by the devoured soul energy, they lost fear of death, and within the span of an hour the outcome was decided.

Almost all of them died; only two lingered on in a pathetic struggle.

Hai Wangu of the Hai Family and the old Cheng who had earlier summoned everyone both possessed Second Stage Transcendent Realm cultivation, and in such a battle they held the clear advantage.

Yet after this exhausting fray their Spirit Bodies were weakened; after trading blows they sat cross-legged to recuperate.

Seeing this, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saintess egged Yang Kai on, urging him to seize the chance and strike the two elders down.

Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly, claiming he was timid and lacked the strength; his refusal contorted the Saintess’s pretty face with vexation.

From the start Yang Kai had shown no fear; watching others slaughter one another, he even critiqued them with obvious relish.

Such behavior meant either absolute confidence or utter ignorance.

The Saintess could not see him as the latter; she was surprised he would pass up such a ripe ambush.

She had no assurance she could win the attack alone, so she stood hesitating in place, full of indecision.

For Yang Kai it would have been easy to kill Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder—indeed, very easy—but he did not want to expose his strength before outsiders; if they were all strangers he could have simply killed them to silence witnesses, yet this Saintess had previously helped him—though it was not the kind of help Yang Kai needed.

If it came down to killing this woman, Yang Kai found he truly could not do it.

He was not a remorseless brute who murdered without cause.

Yang Kai now felt troubled by this dilemma; he wished he could knock her unconscious for the moment.

While he pondered, Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder seemed to finally notice that two outsiders still remained here.

Yang Kai and the Saintess had kept their distance and avoided the chaos, saying nothing, and only now that numbers had thinned could they no longer hide.

Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder exchanged glances and suddenly broke into feral grins.

“Brother Cheng, let’s deal with them first, then we’ll settle our score,” Hai Wangu suggested, still sounding somewhat rational.

The Cheng elder frowned and pondered before nodding slightly, his face cruel as he said, “Perfect—time to replenish our soul energy.”

Saying this, the two rose and glared at the pair, advancing step by step with a confident air.

When they were not far off, the two scanned Yang Kai and the Saintess and suddenly froze, staring at the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land as if in disbelief.

“You…” Hai Wangu pointed at the woman, brow furrowing, “aren’t you Her Highness the Saintess?”

The Cheng elder wore the same look of seeing a ghost, entirely dumbfounded.

The killing intent and hostility that had filled them vanished the moment they recognized the Saintess.

“It is I,” the Saintess said with a slight nod.

“What are you doing here?” Hai Wangu frowned, as if recalling something, then exclaimed in shock, “Did you descend with our Seven Families Alliance?”

“Yes, I only came down to see the scenery and didn’t expect this to happen,” the Saintess replied calmly, composed.

“And who is this?” Hai Wangu looked at Yang Kai with suspicion.

The Saintess hesitated a moment before quickly answering, “He is my attendant!”

Yang Kai’s expression flickered; he was slightly surprised by her answer—she seemed both to want to protect him and to align with him.

If he was her attendant, then he would be counted among the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s people, and Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder would be wary.

Sure enough, upon hearing this the two elders’ faces shifted, showing awkward deference mixed with hesitation and a desire to curry favor.

Their emotional wavering showed plainly in the fluctuations of energy from their Spirit Bodies—sometimes calm, sometimes laced with a dangerous undertone—clearly they were not as respectful as they pretended, and were scheming ill plans.
