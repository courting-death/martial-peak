## Chapter 1970 — Pig Teammate

Mo Xiaoqi gave Yang Kai the feeling of being mysterious.

He vaguely felt that the innocence and naivety she displayed were a disguise, yet he could not find a crack in it, and judging from how generous she had been and the concealment arts she employed, her origins were likely extraordinary.

Ordinary practitioners of the Void King Realm could not possibly have stored so many Void King-Grade Secret Treasures in a Spatial Ring, and each one was of uncommon grade; moreover, from the powerful fluctuations that faintly emanated from her person, it was clear she wore numerous potent Secret Treasures.

This girl absolutely had backing, and it was considerable.

That caused Yang Kai to keep a wary eye on her.

However, since she claimed to have a way to deal with that Fire Bird, Yang Kai was about seventy to eighty percent convinced.

Having accepted someone's kindness, it was hard to refuse; although Yang Kai did not wish to meddle in Yuqing Mountain's affairs any longer, he had received benefits from them, and abruptly withdrawing now would be awkward—so he resolved to see it through.

Xu Qing asked with some concern, "Miss Xiaoqi, you say you have a method to deal with that Fire Bird—can you tell us the details? After all, that beast is formidable; we don't want to repeat others' mistakes."

Yu Ruomei likewise nodded, agreeing with Xu Qing's view.

Mo Xiaoqi frowned, looking troubled; after a long moment, as if she had made up her mind, she said, "I can't go into full detail, but I have a Secret Treasure that restrains its power. Please trust me—I won't have you do anything too dangerous."

Hearing this, Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei exchanged glances and slightly bowed their heads. Xu Qing smiled and said, "If Miss Xiaoqi says so, I will not pry further; I only hope you succeed when the time comes."

"No problem, it's all on me," Mo Xiaoqi said joyfully, patting her chest and adopting a confident air. "Then let's track its position now. Although I don't know where it is at this moment, if we follow the trail we will surely find it."

As she spoke, she took the lead and moved forward again.

They pressed deeper inside, walking for more than an hour; in the tense atmosphere, Mo Xiaoqi once again halted.

The trail ahead suddenly ended.

Just as she furrowed her brows to search for fresh clues, an extraordinary force abruptly surged from somewhere. That force was unbearably hot—upon its appearance the temperature of the air shot upward, and the surrounding verdant trees withered and dried in an instant, then burst into flames.

"Be careful!" Yang Kai shouted.

He did not even need to warn them; the four present were all Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts, highly sensitive to shifts in power; the moment that scorching fluctuation arrived, they had already leapt away in different directions.

Whoosh...

A pitch-black flame, about the size of a washbasin, slammed into their previous position and turned that patch of ground into scorched earth. The black fire roared as if it would never be extinguished—the depth of its color and its terrifying destructive force made the faces of the onlookers change.

"It's here after all!" Mo Xiaoqi cried out, not frightened but overjoyed; her delicate face brimmed with excitement as she fixed her gaze on a certain spot.

At that spot sat a monstrous bird roughly one zhang in length, its whole body fire-red. Its eyes flashed with ferocity as it stared at the four of them; it seemed forged from flame, its body burning with Blazing Flame, trailing long tail feathers—outwardly splendid, like a fire spirit.

"Liu Yan?" Yang Kai stared in astonishment.

The suddenly appearing Fire Bird, from its appearance alone, looked as if it had been cast from the same mold as Liu Yan's true body, but he quickly realized this creature was not Liu Yan.

For although it looked as if made of flame, it was flesh and blood, and Yang Kai also faintly perceived a subtle oppressive power within it—an indescribable force that made even a powerful man like him feel uneasy.

"Whoever spread the rumor that this thing is an Artifact Spirit—what a bastard!" Xu Qing cursed angrily.

Previously outside Yuqing Mountain many had spread word that an Artifact Spirit with consciousness had been born within the mountain, which had drawn countless people there; now it was plain that was not the case, and he had no idea which blind fool had circulated such news.

But it was pointless to argue about that now.

"It's coming again!" Yu Ruomei screamed, her body flickering and leaving an afterimage as she suddenly darted aside.

The next moment, a mass of pitch-black flame struck the spot where she had stood.

When Yu Ruomei reappeared from another direction, her face was still pale with lingering fear. She could clearly feel the tremendous killing power contained in that black flame—if one were accidentally scorched by it, one would be no better off than the Jiang Family's Third Elder.

So many Void King Realm experts had already proven by death how troublesome and fearsome this Fire Bird was—Yu Ruomei dared not be careless.

"Everyone, hold it off for a moment! I'm starting my preparation!" Mo Xiaoqi cried, then leapt aside and formed an arcane hand seal; her entire aura changed at once.

The innocence fell away; Mo Xiaoqi suddenly became solemn and austere, her red lips moving in quiet incantation as a sky-blue sphere materialized before her. Inside the orb surged a tremendous water power, deep and boundless like an ocean; if one listened closely one could even hear the sound of crashing waves within.

"A Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure?" Xu Qing's eyes reddened and his breath quickened as he greedily stared at the sky-blue orb before Mo Xiaoqi.

Although he was a Third Stage of the Void King Realm practitioner, he had never possessed a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure. From how generous Mo Xiaoqi had been earlier, it was possible she held many such treasures, but seeing one now still left Xu Qing visibly shaken.

Moreover, that sky-blue orb plainly seemed to be an Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.

Such an object was priceless to Xu Qing.

"Brother Xu, this is no time to slack off, is it?" Yang Kai snorted and rushed in front of Mo Xiaoqi.

As Mo Xiaoqi drew out the sky-blue orb and chanted, the Fire Bird's ferocious eyes suddenly fixed on her, as if it sensed the threat she posed and marked her as its primary enemy.

The bird opened its beak and spat a dragonlike column of black flame.

Yang Kai's face changed; his first reaction was to dodge.

"Help me hold it off. I can't move right now!" Mo Xiaoqi shouted.

Before Yang Kai could even dodge, Mo Xiaoqi's anxious voice reached his ears.

"You pig!" Yang Kai couldn't help cursing. He could not tell whether Mo Xiaoqi was genuinely foolish or merely feigning it—facing such a powerful enemy and using an art that rendered her immobile was courting death. If he merely dodged now, the black flame would strike her; given its terrifying lethality, the girl would be dead.

Could it be that her nature was truly as she had shown before and not a disguise, and that his earlier suspicions were wrong? Otherwise, how could her combat experience be so shallow?

Anyone with even a modicum of battle sense would not choose such a tactic, unless they completely trusted the people around them with their lives.

And Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei were obviously not companions to whom Mo Xiaoqi could entrust her life.

In an instant many thoughts flashed through Yang Kai's mind, but he quickly shouted, "If you don't want to die here, then come help!"

As he shouted he roared, and five-colored radiance burst forth from his body.

He thrust his hand forward and murmured, "Earth sword qi—Dayan Divine Shield!"

An earth-colored light peeled away from him and soon formed a shield-shaped protection before him.

Yang Kai cultivated the Undying Five Elements Sword qi and had absorbed a large amount of Dayan Divine Sand's energy as earth-attribute power; now he could manifest the force of Dayan Divine Sand to form a defense.

Earth is heavy and defensive by nature, and the Dayan Divine Shield's defensive strength was by no means trivial.

But that was not all—Yang Kai peeled away a pale cyan light, and wood-attribute sword qi instantly formed into a phantom thicket as a second layer of defense behind the Dayan Divine Shield.

Then came the water attribute, the metal attribute, the fire attribute...

All five elements of his sword qi were deployed; the five-colored radiance that had enveloped Yang Kai vanished in a flash and was replaced by five interlocking layers of defense.

Boom...

The black flame slammed into the Dayan Divine Shield and tore through it in an instant, surging into the phantasmal thicket and burning everything it touched.

Water curtains evaporated, the gleaming metal walls melted, and only Yang Kai's primary fire sword qi could tangle with the black flame for a time.

After all, that was sword qi refined by Yang Kai from Sun's True Fire; in tier it was not inferior to the black flame, but in quantity it was lacking, and in the blink of an eye it fell to the defensive.

The oncoming heat and killing intent made Yang Kai's hair stand on end; the breath of death swept over him, and he seemed to glimpse the call of the reaper.

Only then did Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei finally react.

Though they had been acting furtively, they were not idiots; they knew that they were no match for the Fire Bird, and if they wanted to survive they had to first preserve Mo Xiaoqi's life so she could complete her art.

So seeing Yang Kai take action, they had no choice but to act as well.

"Sky Net Slash!"

"Limitless Holy Seal!"

Two supreme techniques from Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei slammed toward the unstoppable black flame dragon—when Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts unleashed their full power, they were not to be underestimated.

Together their combined efforts instantly eased the pressure on Yang Kai.
