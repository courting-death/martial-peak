## Chapter 542 — Reinforcements from the Seven Great Families

The reinforcements from the Seven Great Families were led by Qiu Yimeng of the Qiu Family and Huo Xingchen of the Huo Family.

Kang Zhan of the Kang Family and Gao Rangfeng of the Gao Family had also arrived.

Even Liu Qingyao, the First Young Master of Zhongdu, was present, leading a group of experts from the Liu Family. He stood silently in a corner, refraining from any interaction.

Observing this grand scene, Huo Xingchen sneered, “Pathetic.”

“Yes, truly pathetic,” Qiu Yimeng nodded softly. “The Seven Great Families have set their sights on Yang Kai so intensely, yet they still send members of the younger generation as commanders. Clearly, they intend to use the Yang Family Succession War as a stage to deceive the public’s perception.”

Huo Xingchen shrugged. “It can’t be helped. Those in the know understand the Seven Great Families’ true purpose: to take down Yang Kai. But to outsiders unaware of the details, the Succession War isn’t over yet. Yang Family’s Succession War must conclude flawlessly. They cannot let it be known that Yang Kai was suddenly eliminated without cause — that would make a mockery of the whole affair.”

Just as First Brother Yang Wei had clearly seen the situation, Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen had also discerned the true state of affairs.

What followed was no longer merely the Succession War. Instead, the Seven Great Families were using the stage of the Succession War to make a grand entrance, jointly putting on a spectacular show for all to see.

The secret conversation between Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen did not escape the notice of the other young masters present.

Kang Zhan and Gao Rangfeng hesitated for a long moment before approaching Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen.

Huo Xingchen calmly regarded the two approaching men and chuckled lightly, “Young Master Kang, how is your injury recovery progressing?”

“Thank you for your concern, Brother Huo. The injury is no longer serious. The young master dealt with me precisely; he avoided any significant damage,” Kang Zhan replied calmly, nodding slightly without harboring any bitterness over being wounded by Yang Kai.

“That’s good, that’s good. Heh heh.” Huo Xingchen’s smile was forced.

Sensing his disdain, Gao Rangfeng and Kang Zhan felt a bit helpless. Gao Rangfeng said, “Brother Huo, although previously Kang and I were adversaries of the young master, it was under duress. We both greatly admire his skill and personal strength. If possible, we would be willing to become friends with him.”

“Oh?” Huo Xingchen feigned surprise. “I hadn’t realized both Young Masters Kang and Gao were such magnanimous men. After all that Yang Kai has done to you, you still want to befriend him? Ha! Do you mean that sincerely, or is it all a deception?”

“Brother Huo, if you still regard us with suspicion, then Kang and I have nothing more to say,” Gao Rangfeng replied seriously.

Huo Xingchen watched him closely, gradually shutting off his smile and turning solemn. The two locked eyes; Gao Rangfeng’s expression remained calm.

“What do you want to say?” Qiu Yimeng, who had been quietly observing, suddenly asked.

Gao Rangfeng frowned, quietly asking, “Kang and I are puzzled as to why the Seven Great Families are treating the young master like this, yet the Yang Family shows no sign of response. Since you two are always with him, surely you know more than we do?”

“Indeed,” Kang Zhan nodded. “This matter is so confusing. I was recuperating at home when my father sent me out. When I asked him, he refused to explain. Miss Qiu, Brother Huo, if you know any information, could you share it? If not convenient, just pretend we didn’t ask.”

Huo Xingchen remained silent, simply looking at Qiu Yimeng.

Although his time in the Yang Kai residence equaled hers, he did not meddle in household affairs nor maintain close contact with the Yang Family. Qiu Yimeng, on the other hand, often privately consulted with Yang Kai and understood the household well.

Their questions echoed Huo Xingchen’s own doubts.

Facing the three men’s gazes, Qiu Yimeng shook her head slowly, “I’m not sure myself. You’ve asked the wrong person.”

Gao Rangfeng and Kang Zhan couldn’t help showing disappointed expressions.

“But though I don’t know for certain, I can make some rough conjectures,” Qiu Yimeng shifted her tone.

“Oh? Please enlighten us,” Kang Zhan and Gao Rangfeng’s eyes brightened.

“Yang Kai is being targeted so severely either because he has deeply angered everyone, crossing taboos that the Eight Great Families cannot tolerate,” Qiu Yimeng said calmly and deliberately. “Such as the rumors against him: cultivating forbidden arts, having the Evil Lord come from the same sect, harboring disciples of the Evil Sect, displaying signs of entering a demonic state…”

These matters could be trivial or grave, but now that someone is exploiting them to stir trouble, they become significant.

“We have already deduced that much. Our families sent us as reinforcements for this reason too, but we all feel the situation is not so simple,” Gao Rangfeng said, frowning in confusion.

“Could there be another reason?” Kang Zhan asked eagerly.

“If not this, then Yang Kai must possess something the Seven Great Families desire,” Qiu Yimeng sneered. After speaking, her eyes lit up, her pupils trembling slightly as she suddenly realized a crucial point. Her dark brows furrowed deeply as she fell into contemplation.

The others suddenly felt a dawning understanding.

Where coin and gain flow, crowds gather; all the world’s hustle and bustle is for profit.

If this were the case, it would make sense.

Seeing the ever-changing expression on Qiu Yimeng’s face, they knew she likely understood the cause. Yet since she remained silent, Kang Zhan and Gao Rangfeng felt no further urge to press.

Still, the way the Eight Great Families acted this time made them feel as if they were playing the whore while putting up a chastity arch.

If they wanted to take down Yang Kai, with the influence and strength of the Eight Great Families, they could do so openly and honorably. Instead, they chose to hide behind the Succession War.

Being young and fiery, these men felt a subtle resentment rising.

While they spoke, Liu Qingyao continued meditating with closed eyes, appearing indifferent. Yet all present could sense a faint Divine Sense enveloping the four of them, clearly revealing Liu Qingyao’s attention to their conversation.

None of the four were wary of him.

Meanwhile, inside the residence.

Second Young Master Yang Zhao sat motionless beside his bed.

In just over ten days, the once vibrant and commanding Yang Zhao had grown haggard. His face was pale, his eye sockets sunken, and red veins filled his eyeballs, presenting a dreadful spectacle.

Ye Xinrou moved gracefully before him, pacing as she painstakingly relayed the current situation.

Gradually, the seemingly vacant expression on Yang Zhao’s face showed some color. His bloodshot eyes began to move.

“Second Young Master, the Seven Great Families have all sent reinforcements. Each family has dispatched at least twenty experts above the Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage, including some at the peak of Divine Roaming Realm. The Seven Great Families want you to take command and defeat Yang Kai as quickly as possible to win the Succession War.”

“Why would the Seven Great Families send so many to the Succession War?” Yang Zhao’s voice was hoarse and weak, his condition seemingly critical.

Ye Xinrou smiled awkwardly, “Didn’t I just tell you? Yang Kai is likely to become an Evil Lord. The Yang Family cannot allow such a person to inherit the headship. The Seven Great Families coexist with the Yang Family in Zhongdu; their lives are intertwined. Naturally, they won’t let this go. Now they gather here, waiting for your orders. Second Young Master, the Yang Family’s headship beckons you.”

“Is it really only for this reason?” Yang Zhao’s gaze grew cold as he stared at the delicate woman before him.

“What other reason could there be?” Ye Xinrou was momentarily stunned, then an impatient look rose on her face. She stepped forward, wrapped her arms around Yang Zhao’s, and coaxed, “Second Young Master, don’t just sit there like an idiot. Let’s prepare and go. It won’t do for them to wait too long.”

“I won’t go,” Yang Zhao’s spiritless tone remained unchanged. He shook off Ye Xinrou’s embrace.

Startled, Ye Xinrou asked, “Second Young Master, what’s wrong with you?”

Yang Zhao shook his head. “The Succession War is a battle of wits and courage among the Yang brothers, a contest of connections and charisma. I have already lost, utterly defeated. There is no reason to continue.”

“How could that be? There are still many loyal people here, and more experts have just arrived. They’re here to support you. This is your chance to make a comeback,” Ye Xinrou encouraged.

“The people of the Seven Great Families… Heh,” Yang Zhao sneered, “If I use them to defeat Ninth Brother, even if I become head of the family, I will never find peace for the rest of my life.”

“Second Young Master, you don’t mean that.” Ye Xinrou curled her lips in disdain. “But relying solely on the people here, it’s impossible to overcome Yang Kai. Now that such a good opportunity lies before you, how can you fail to seize it?”

She paused, then sneered, “Could it be that you fear public opinion? Second Young Master, great men do not fuss over small matters; history is written by victors. Once you take the headship of the Yang Family, who will dare criticize you?”

Yang Zhao remained expressionless and unresponsive.

Ye Xinrou swiftly lost patience, her tone turning cold. “Second Young Master, I hope you can think of the bigger picture. This is also tacitly approved by the Yang Family. If you refuse, it will be seen as defiance of the family. Ha! The glorious Second Young Master of the Yang Family acts like a beaten dog. It’s laughable!”

Yang Zhao suddenly raised his head. His scarlet eyes fixed on Ye Xinrou. Fear surged in her heart. Before she could react, she felt her neck constricted. Dizziness swept over her. When she came to, she was already on the bed.

Their faces were almost touching. Ye Xinrou distinctly smelled the burning breath issuing from Yang Zhao’s nostrils—not passion, but fury.

His iron-like hand gripped her neck fiercely.

Terrified, Ye Xinrou suddenly recalled that she was no match for Yang Zhao.

“Second Young Master, what are you trying to do…” she gasped, pain and fear mingling in her eyes as she gazed weakly at Yang Zhao.
