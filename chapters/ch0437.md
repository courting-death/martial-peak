## Chapter 437 — Arrivals Come One After Another

Luo Xiaoman and Qiu Yimeng found themselves in rather similar predicaments. Both were women of considerable status within their respective factions, yet their gender often rendered them helpless in many situations.

“I’m well aware,” Yang Kai nodded softly. “Let’s go out together to greet them.”

Hearing this, Qiu Yimeng’s face immediately brightened. “At least you have some conscience.”

Standing up, Yang Kai led a group of people out. Before leaving, Qiu Yimeng turned back to give Lü Song a reminder, “Wait here for a moment. I will arrange things for you shortly.”

Lü Song nodded indifferently, though he couldn’t help but feel a sense of being looked down upon. After all, Yang Kai had not bothered to go out to welcome him earlier.

Outside the manor, the group from Ziwei Valley quietly waited, with Luo Xiaoman at their head.

After a short while, Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng stepped out together, followed by Dong Qinghan and Lan Chudie.

“Sister Qiu!” Luo Xiaoman called out joyfully upon seeing Qiu Yimeng and immediately moved forward. However, when she caught sight of Yang Kai standing nearby, she suddenly froze, shrinking back in extreme timidity.

Her terror of Yang Kai was ingrained in her very soul. For some unknown reason, just seeing or remembering Yang Kai would fill her with overwhelming fear.

Had it not been for being with Qiu Yimeng, she would not have dared to stand on Yang Kai's side.

“Xiaoman,” Qiu Yimeng, knowing her timidity, quickly approached and took her hand, soothing her for some time.

Yang Kai looked at her with a faint smile, then cast his gaze towards Lan Chudie, who followed Dong Qinghan. To his surprise, he noticed a common trait between these two women.

They both possessed remarkably ample bosoms. Neither was tall; in fact, they were petite and delicate, yet they had remarkably well-endowed chests.

After inspecting them briefly, Yang Kai suddenly felt two ominous vibes sweeping over him, causing some dizziness.

Lan Chudie caught his brazen gaze with a blush on her face.

“Fan Hong from Ziwei Valley. Greetings, Young Master Kai!” a young man stepped forward from the Ziwei Valley entourage, smiling warmly as he cupped his fists in salute.

“Brother Fan is no stranger. No need for formalities,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Fan Hong smiled wryly. “If I offended you in Lingxiao Pavilion last time, please don’t take it to heart. I’m here to apologize.”

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered as his attitude softened, breaking into a hearty laugh. “Brother Fan helping me is an honor. Past matters are but fleeting clouds, long forgotten.”

Previously, inside Lingxiao Pavilion, Dong Qinghan from the Dong Family, Bai Yunfeng from the Bai Family, and Fan Hong from Ziwei Valley had jointly attempted to poach talent from the sect. When they learned that Yang Kai possessed a set of Mystery-Grade Martial Skills, they were all intrigued and offered different prices to purchase the skill set.

Dong Qinghan knew Yang Kai’s background; Bai Yunfeng did not, offending Yang Kai in the process, and was ultimately killed in the Spider Mother’s Nest within Cangyun Evil Land.

Fan Hong’s attitude had never been outright hostile, unlike Bai Yunfeng, so Yang Kai had not held a grudge against him.

Fan Hong’s expression immediately brightened upon hearing this, thanking him repeatedly.

“Come in for tea. We can talk while drinking,” Yang Kai warmly invited.

Ziwei Valley had sent a modest number of people—not too few, not too many. Their strength was roughly on par with those the Lü Family had brought. Since this succession war was a stage for the younger generation, the attendees naturally looked to Fan Hong and Luo Xiaoman for leadership.

Yet Luo Xiaoman and Qiu Yimeng were inseparable, so Yang Kai figured that Ziwei Valley likely followed Luo Xiaoman’s orders, which amounted to obeying Qiu Yimeng’s commands.

This arrangement effectively made them his allies.

Yang Kai’s mind turned as he classified the members of Ziwei Valley’s forces in his heart.

In the side hall, Yang Kai introduced the young masters and young ladies of the various factions as they exchanged polite greetings and took their seats.

Lü Song looked displeased at first, but upon noticing that Yang Kai had come out to greet Luo Xiaoman, comprehension dawned in his eyes, and his anger abated considerably. Since ancient times, heroes love beauties; it was understandable for Yang Kai to welcome a charming maiden who had come to his side.

His roving eyes lingered repeatedly on Luo Xiaoman and Lan Chudie, deeply moved, secretly comparing which held the greater allure.

Luo Xiaoman had once been a lively, spirited girl, but after her trip to Cangyun Evil Land, her nature had changed drastically—now she was even more timid than a mouse. With Lü Song staring at her like that, she grew uneasy and instinctively moved closer to Qiu Yimeng’s side. In contrast, Lan Chudie stood by Dong Qinghan gracefully, her beautiful eyes locking onto Lü Song’s with no fear, a faint icy smile curling the corners of her lips.

Lü Song immediately restrained himself.

Though Yang Kai chatted amiably with Fan Hong and Dong Qinghan, he observed everyone’s expressions carefully, noting Lü Song’s awkwardness and inwardly chuckling coldly.

Senior Sister Lan was not someone to be trifled with. She was strong-willed and wouldn’t allow anyone to take advantage without protest.

Before long, Xiang Tianxiao, the errand runner, entered again.

Before he spoke, Yang Kai asked, “Who is it this time?”

“Just a young man and woman, their strength around Seventh Stage of the True Yuan Realm,” Xiang Tianxiao answered earnestly. “They claim to be your old acquaintances — a Chen Xueshu and a Shu Xiaoyu.”

“Them?” Yang Kai looked surprised.

“You know them?” Qiu Yimeng asked in astonishment.

“Mm, yes,” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “I met them when training outside once. They are a senior brother and junior sister couple from Yingyue Sect.”

“Yingyue Sect…” Qiu Yimeng frowned thoughtfully. “If I recall correctly, Yingyue Sect is only a second-rate sect.”

“Indeed, second-rate,” Yang Kai nodded.

Xiang Tianxiao added, “They’re coming alone, with no experts accompanying them. What do you want me to do?”

Two young martial artists of roughly Seventh Stage True Yuan would have no impact in the succession war. To participate, major factions usually sent groups or resources, never just a pair of weak younglings.

Xiang Tianxiao’s tone implied he regarded Chen and Shu’s intention as merely trying to attach themselves to Yang Kai’s name for gain.

“Even if they are old acquaintances, if their intentions are bad, you know how to refuse,” Dong Qinghan reminded him as an elder cousin.

If Yang Kai rejected them outright, it might discourage others who brought manpower or resources to side with him. After all, Yingyue Sect would demand a share of the spoils if victorious in the succession war.

If they came with sincerity, their small numbers and weak strength did not matter—it was their earnestness that counted.

“They won’t have ill intent,” Yang Kai shook his head, stood up, and straightened his clothes. “Wait here. I will personally go out to greet them.”

Qiu Yimeng was momentarily taken aback, wondering why Yang Kai treated a second-rate sect with such solemnity. He hadn’t been this welcoming even to those from Ziwei Valley just now.

Lost in thought, she smiled softly.

Glancing at Lü Song, she saw the young master’s expression had turned sour.

Frowning, Qiu Yimeng guessed Lü Song was jealous of Yang Kai’s differential treatment and sighed inwardly. Lü Liang sending his son to this succession war could only spell trouble.

Qiu Yimeng had little interaction with this Lü Family cousin before and didn’t know his nature. But now she found the boy lacking the makings of a great man.

Suddenly, she smiled wryly and said, “Lü Song, don’t overthink it. Since those two are acquaintances of Yang Kai, his going out to welcome them is understandable. When they come in, just hassle them and get rid of them. A mere pair from a second-rate sect has no right to stay here.”

Dong Qinghan looked surprised, seemingly unaccustomed to seeing the young lady so petty.

Lü Song, silently fuming, brightened upon hearing Qiu Yimeng’s words, believing she was supporting him. He quickly nodded. “Cousin is right. Which of us isn’t from a first-rate force? That Yingyue Sect dares send only two to the succession war? Ridiculous. I’ll see what face they have to stay.”

Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly without adding more. Encouraged by her look, Lü Song was eager to give Chen and Shu a harsh lesson once they arrived.

Outside the manor, a young couple anxiously waited, their eyes fixed ahead.

Shu Xiaoyu looked in but saw no sign of Yang Kai after a long wait. Pouting, she said, “Senior Brother, do you really think this Yang Kai is the Yang Kai? We’ve already given our names, but no one’s paying attention.”

Chen Xueshu smiled bitterly. “You’re asking me? How would I know if this is the same Yang brother? There are plenty of namesakes in this world.”

“Ah…” Shu Xiaoyu felt disappointed. “If this isn’t the Yang Kai we know, it would be so humiliating if he rejects us after we traveled all this way.”

“Humiliation or not, Master didn’t want to join this succession war anyway. Yingyue Sect is a second-rate force with limited resources. The only reason we’re involved is because of this Yang Kai we heard about. If he isn’t the one we know, rejection would be good; we can just turn back and avoid trouble.”

“I think it’s him!” Shu Xiaoyu suddenly affirmed. “Remember his performance in the other realm? The Tianlang Kingdom’s few people were outplayed by him, and he saved all our lives. Besides the Yang Family in Zhongdu, no other force can cultivate someone like him.”

Recalling their experiences abroad, Chen Xueshu could only bitterly smile. Without that Yang Kai, their group of Han warriors might have perished without a trace.

“Whether yes or no, we’ll soon find out.”
