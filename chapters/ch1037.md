## Chapter 1037 — Why Are You Chasing Me?

It is precisely because Heaven-and-Earth Energy is scarce that, on Tongxuan Continent, reaching the Saint Realm marks the pinnacle of a martial cultivator’s path; from ancient times until now only the Great Demon God managed to break through that barrier, yet he fell to the world before he could explore the Starry Sky, leaving behind nothing but tales that people still tell.

Insufficient cultivation and a lack of resources left the cultivators of Tongxuan Continent with neither the qualification nor the means to explore or enter the Starry Sky; they could only remain trapped there, never witnessing its many wonders.

Yet this also spared Tongxuan Continent the fate of being enslaved.

The overall strength of the cultivators on Tongxuan Continent is still not enough for it to secure a place within the Star Domain; were they to integrate into the Star Domain they would only be taken in and subjugated by the stronger powers there.

Yang Kai rode calmly across Shuiyue Star, streaking over towering ranges, seas and deserts—covering tens to hundreds of li in a single instant—and encountered many cities and settlements.

These cities varied in size but were, on the whole, prosperous; only in a few extremely remote spots did the number of living beings within a city dwindle.

As on Tongxuan Continent, each city had a city lord stationed to govern it, and depending on a city’s prosperity the lord’s cultivation could be high or low.

Many of those city-lord figures cultivated to the Saint King Realm, and in some small places the city lord’s realm was only the Saint Realm.

This made Yang Kai realize that experts of the Origin Returning Realm are not numerous within any given force; they are the backbone of every power.

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy of each region also differed greatly; some places were saturated with Spiritual Qi, while others were extremely thin.

All of these cities belonged to the Hengluo Commerce Guild, contributing their strength within its jurisdiction and accumulating wealth bit by bit, until the Hengluo Commerce Guild grew into the behemoth it is.

Yang Kai merely glanced around as he went and no one paid him any heed, nor did he attract any trouble.

He heard a great many interesting rumors.

For example: Chairman Ai Ou’s lecherous nature; the guild’s upcoming talent selection; and the matter of Ai Ou’s several offspring...

What he did not hear anyone speak of was Shen Tu; it seemed that on Shuiyue Star Shen Tu’s status as an illegitimate son was kept secret, which explained why even Lü Guichen was unaware of Shen Tu’s existence.

Yang Kai spent a month or two traversing the entirety of Shuiyue Star. He gained a solid understanding of this Cultivation Star and of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, and the new Star Shuttle he had acquired fit him perfectly, responding as naturally as an extension of his arm.

Deep down he still harbored a small hope—that Su Yan might be somewhere on this Cultivation Star—and that was why he pressed on with such relentless speed.

But Su Yan was clearly not here. He and Su Yan were heart-linked; as long as they were not too far apart they could sense each other’s presence.

He felt no disappointment; he never expected to find Su Yan so easily.

About two months later Yang Kai returned; this time he did not linger anywhere, but flew straight toward the direction of Shen Tu’s palace.

One day, as he passed a valley, his outward Divine Sense suddenly detected many life fluctuations coming from that direction.

He did not pay much attention, and to avoid any unnecessary trouble deliberately altered his course, intending to pass by from the flank.

He had been acting cautiously of late, determined not to make enemies.

Suspended midair, he casually cast his gaze that way and saw on the valley floor a warship, not particularly large, with its hatch open; cultivators were constantly entering and exiting.

Beside the ship were piles of provisions, and those cultivators seemed to be hauling the supplies into the vessel.

From this period of learning Yang Kai had picked up some common knowledge: certain supplies cannot be placed inside a Spatial Ring—either because they require extremely stringent storage conditions that would be ruined inside a ring, or because they are simply too large or heavy.

In such cases a warship must be used for transport.

Thus warships are indispensable to any great power: they transport quickly, carry a great weight, and are relatively safe.

The warship moored in the valley was only about thirty zhang in length—only half the size of the one Yang Kai had seen before—likely merely a Saint King-Grade Lower-Level or Middle-Level warship.

Beside the warship stood a youth in brocade, refined and genteel, chatting and laughing with those around him.

The youth’s appearance was distinctive: delicate, smooth skin and a face even more alluring than a woman’s, long hair carelessly draped over his shoulders.

Many female cultivators around him glanced at him with infatuated eyes, love hidden within their gazes; it seemed that with a single word he could make any of them willingly surrender their bodies and hearts to him.

Yang Kai found himself looking at him a moment longer.

That look put the man on guard; he raised his head, locked eyes with Yang Kai across thousands of zhang, and the handsome face suddenly soured. He raised a hand, pointed toward the sky where Yang Kai hovered, and spoke a few words under his breath.

In the next instant several Star Shuttles flashed and shot toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned, bewildered as to why he had been targeted.

Without slowing, Yang Kai made a quick escape, but the streaks of light pursued him relentlessly.

This place was very remote; within Yang Kai’s Divine Sense there were no living people to be seen, and even the Spiritual Qi here was exceedingly thin, as if no one lived in this place.

Shuiyue Star contained many such spots; this was only one of them.

Three people chased him; from the energy fluctuations they emitted Yang Kai judged that two of them were cultivators at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm and one was of the Saint King Realm.

That Saint King Realm cultivator did not seem to possess a very high realm; Yang Kai felt no overwhelming oppression from him—he guessed him to be only First Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Having discerned their cultivation, Yang Kai relaxed; he no longer wanted to flee, but rather intended to halt and spar with them a while to test his current strength.

Ever since he had fused and converted the Saint Yuan attribute within his body he had not yet fought against a Saint King Realm cultivator, and he was eager to see whether his present power could stand shoulder to shoulder with a Saint King Realm practitioner.

With that thought he came to a stop and turned to look back.

Seeing Yang Kai halt, the three gleefully surged forward, flanking him from three sides to encircle him, their faces filled with ill intent.

"Gentlemen, why are you chasing me? We have no grievances, do we?" Yang Kai asked calmly.

"We naturally hold no grudge!" the Saint King Realm expert nodded. "But brat, you saw something you shouldn’t have—your luck ran out passing through here at this moment!"

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and instantly understood what had happened.

The loading of supplies into the warship was probably not a good thing, which was why they chose such a remote, seldom-trodden place; who would have imagined a passerby would accidentally come by and see everything?

Judging by their expressions and tone, this matter clearly would not end well.

"If you have any last words you may speak them; if it’s convenient I will relay them to your family," the Saint King Realm expert said coolly, certain of his victory.

As he spoke, the Third Stage cultivator behind Yang Kai suddenly moved. A nimble, drifting energy poured from his body and a huge, exquisitely sharp Wind Blade silently formed, shooting straight to cut at Yang Kai’s back and split him in two.

The Wind Blade moved with terrifying speed and in an instant rushed to within three inches of Yang Kai’s body.

The attacker’s face brimmed with contempt, as if he could already see Yang Kai struck down.

At his Third Stage of the Saint Realm level, a sneak attack upon a youth of the Second Stage of the Saint Realm should have left no chance of failure.

The Wind Blade sliced cleanly through the youth’s torso, piercing him through.

Yet, strangely, no blood spilled; the youth’s figure instead slowly began to fade and then vanished.

The attacker’s eyelids tightened, alarm rising in his heart; without thinking he immediately retreated.

"Watch out!" a shout rose from the Saint King Realm cultivator; his eyes widened as though he had seen something unbelievable, loudly warning his companions.

His reaction was swift; after all, one who had reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm had gone through countless life-and-death battles and had honed excellent adaptability.

At the shout, the retreating figure changed direction and shot upward.

In an instant he saw his two companions reveal expressions of absolute terror—their faces as if they had swallowed their tongues.

From above came a terrifying, heart-stopping fluctuation of energy, alternately cold then hot, shifting without pause and impossible to guard against.

Looking up, he saw a gigantic palm imprint bearing down on him, blotting out the heavens and obscuring the light before him; his vision showed nothing but that hand devouring his heart and mind.

It was a palm burning with pitch-black flames; in his life he had never witnessed such bizarre energy.

Heaven-Covering Palm!

He tried to flee but there was nowhere to escape; the massive palm sealed off every route of retreat.

Boom...

A muffled impact rang out as the cultivator was swallowed by the palm imprint; a violent force swept through his body, screams erupted, and he fell like a meteor, bones breaking and flesh mangled. Clusters of demonic-like flames burned across him, and no matter how he drove his power he could not extinguish the inferno consuming him.

With his first strike landing true, Yang Kai wasted no time—condensing a Heaven-Slaying Spear in an instant. While the remaining two were still frozen in shock, he hurled it viciously toward another cultivator at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

The opponent hurriedly gathered his strength to block; a shield-like Secret Treasure was brought forth—this shield was of no low grade, emanating Saint-Grade Upper-Level energy fluctuations as it spun in front of him to intercept.
