## Chapter 1193 — Your Luck Is Really Good

That cold-faced man intended to monopolize the central area within a three zhang radius, his tone utterly domineering.

But no one thought there was anything wrong; even Qu Changfeng, after witnessing the man's imposing might, looked slightly astonished.

Yang Kai's body trembled slightly, not from fear, but because a strange excitement welled up in his chest.

He had seen many geniuses on Dark Star recently, but none had stirred in him the urge to have a proper fight like this cold-faced man; Yang Kai didn't know whether he could defeat this person with his current means, and that uncertainty made him impatient to test it.

But now was not the time to seek a great duel; the Soul Cleansing Divine Water was the foremost concern.

He would still be operating on Dark Star and would sooner or later have a chance to spar with this man, so Yang Kai's expression soon returned to normal. He also quietly rejoiced that he had not acted rashly upon entering.

When he entered the stone chamber, for a moment Yang Kai even entertained the thought of driving everyone away and monopolizing the effects of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water. Had he acted then, he might not have been able to defeat that one person; fighting him would not only expose his true strength but would allow Qu Changfeng and the others to reap the spoils.

The world is vast; geniuses and odd talents are indeed many! This cold-faced man was the most formidable Saint King Realm practitioner Yang Kai had seen so far; even Xue Yue of the Hengluo Commerce Guild likely would not be his match, which made Yang Kai much more alert and resolved never again to casually underestimate martial artists of the same rank.

In the stone chamber, aside from several Battle Sky Alliance members who stood frozen, the others each sought a spot, sat cross-legged, and absorbed the effects of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water. As they began washing spirit and purifying soul, expressions of inexplicable joy spread across their faces; some even moaned aloud, as if in rapt relief.

"Enter!" Qu Changfeng no longer wasted time and waved his hand with a sullen face.

The Battle Sky Alliance disciples who had been waiting for his decision filed into the pool one after another, coming to the open spaces and sitting cross-legged.

Qu Changfeng's face was dark and ferocious, a surge of rage in his heart that would not calm. But even if he were bolder, he dared not provoke that cold-faced man; aside from whether he could be his match, the monstrous force behind the man made even the Battle Sky Alliance highly wary.

Unable to vent his anger, Qu Changfeng grew very displeased; for reasons no one could tell, he actually leaped directly in front of Yang Kai and barked coldly, "Get lost, this spot is mine!"

Yang Kai's position wasn't especially good, but it wasn't bad either; it would suffice.

He had entered here with the crowd and hadn't been particular, casually taking a place—only to find Qu Changfeng had set his sights on it.

Yang Kai understood that Qu Changfeng was merely venting his anger and not truly intent on occupying this spot, since there were better positions elsewhere.

Qu Changfeng's deliberate behavior was clearly meant to cause trouble.

Because Yang Kai was the weakest and alone, who else could Qu Changfeng pick on? The fact he didn't expel anyone outright was obviously out of deference to the cold-faced man.

Yang Kai's expression chilled, but after a moment's thought he restrained himself, stood up obediently, and moved to a nearby empty spot.

Qu Changfeng snorted coldly, pleased with Yang Kai's conduct as if he had regained some face; his expression eased, and once he sat cross-legged and began absorbing the Soul Cleansing Divine Water's effects, a look of delight immediately appeared and all prior displeasure vanished.

"Little brother, your luck is really quite good." The beautiful woman who had earlier urged Yang Kai not to waste time now sat not far from him; seeing him driven off by Qu Changfeng, she smiled to comfort him. "It seems staying was the right choice—you can pick up something good. Compared to such a great opportunity, don't fuss over other matters. I've been sitting here a while and feel the bottleneck in my Divine Sense loosen; you should absorb quickly—you might comprehend something."

"Oh." Yang Kai did not wish to converse with her further, simply replying once before beginning to absorb the effects of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

The Soul Cleansing Divine Water's miraculous nature stemmed entirely from the tremendous Divine Sense of the Void King Realm expert: when a Void King Realm expert died here, their Divine Sense energy perfectly fused with the spiritual liquid and, over countless years of transformation, formed the Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

Although Yang Kai did not know why the water here was golden, after that brief absorption he was certain it was indeed the Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

He naturally would not waste time.

The beautiful woman was right: cultivating here could not only strengthen Divine Sense cultivation—cleansing spirit and purifying soul to make Divine Sense power more condensed and solid—but if one's luck held, one might even comprehend some Soul Technique belonging to that deceased Void King Realm expert.

The methods of a Void King Realm expert could hardly be poor; even learning a mere fragment of their divine arts would be useful for a lifetime.

To date Yang Kai had only seen one Void King Realm expert—Ghost Ancestor! His earth-shattering methods left him yearning whenever he recalled them; surely other Void King Realm experts would be no worse.

His pores dilated and flesh trembled as strands of golden energy threaded through his skin into Yang Kai's viscera, then shot up to his head and poured into his Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai felt cautiously, dividing his mind: half alert to the outside to avoid being ambushed at such a critical moment, the other half diving into the Sea of Consciousness to observe the water's miraculous effects.

He saw clearly that his Sea of Consciousness, blazing crimson like a sea of flames, received many golden filaments; though not numerous, their color was striking, standing out like golden fish swimming freely in the red sea.

Half of those golden filaments were soon absorbed into his Sea of Consciousness' waters, strengthening its power and tempering its resilience; though the increase was almost imperceptible, it was already remarkable.

A martial artist's cultivation, taken in total, comes down to four aspects.

Physical strengthening, accumulation of Saint Yuan, tempering of Divine Sense, and comprehension of realms.

The simplest is the accumulation of Saint Yuan, since it can rely on external items like Pills and Saint Crystals, which martial artists use during cultivation.

The hardest is comprehension of realms!

Many martial artists meet the requirements in the other three aspects yet cannot break their bottleneck because their realm comprehension is insufficient. On Dark Star, ninety-nine percent of Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts are stuck on comprehension, never advancing in their lifetimes.

Physical strengthening is relatively easy early on and can be aided by external forces, but becomes increasingly difficult later; reaching the pinnacle is nearly impossible. Yang Kai's formidable body is the result of countless fortunes, yet it is far from the absolute peak and still takes some damage from powerful attacks.

It can only be said that compared with martial artists of the same rank, even Origin Returning Realm practitioners, his body was many times stronger, and the vast vitality contained in his Golden Blood provided terrifying regenerative power, allowing him to recover to full in a very short time after injury.

Cultivating Divine Sense power is far more difficult than accumulating Saint Yuan and even harder than bodily strengthening, second only to comprehension of realms.

Many martial artists, after breaking a realm, intentionally choose a period of seclusion to focus on Divine Sense cultivation and increase its power. Pills have limited effect on Divine Sense, and cultivation methods for Divine Sense are exceedingly rare and precious everywhere.

This is true on the Tongxuan Continent and equally so within the Star Domain.

Eighty percent of methods for training Divine Sense consist of practicing Soul Techniques repeatedly, exhausting Divine Sense power and then recovering it; through cycles of depletion and restoration Divine Sense power slowly grows.

It's a crude method, but the simplest and very practical.

Yang Kai did not need that method because he had the Warm Spirit Lotus, and he lacked the time to go into long seclusion to cultivate Divine Sense; yet his Divine Sense still exceeded that of peers by a large margin, comparable to Origin Returning Realm experts.

The reason for this was none other than the Warm Spirit Lotus!

This Heaven and Earth treasure that nourished Divine Sense had been obtained by Yang Kai when he was still weak, and it had coexisted with him for over twenty years. Through their mutual support, his Divine Sense continued to grow stronger day by day, while the Warm Spirit Lotus itself also kept developing and maturing.

Now, the Soul Cleansing Divine Water's effects, even after just a little, brought Yang Kai considerable gain; his Divine Sense seemed to strengthen as if by many days' accumulation, which greatly pleased him.

Under his mind's attention, other golden filaments that had not yet fused into his Sea of Consciousness seemed to be drawn, swiftly rushing to where the Six-Colored Treasure Isle resided within his Sea of Consciousness and quickly vanishing into it.

This phenomenon did not surprise Yang Kai.

Because the Warm Spirit Lotus inherently had this function. When he had taken Pills that enhanced Divine Sense in the past, the Warm Spirit Lotus would absorb much for its own growth. Although in the short term it seemed to take from Yang Kai, over the long years the benefits the Warm Spirit Lotus returned to him far exceeded what he had given it.

The Soul Cleansing Divine Water could cleanse spirit and purify soul; naturally it also aided the Warm Spirit Lotus's growth.

What surprised Yang Kai was that after the Warm Spirit Lotus devoured those golden filaments, it actively emitted an overwhelming attraction; in an instant, dozens of times more golden energy than before surged into Yang Kai's body and poured into his Sea of Consciousness.
