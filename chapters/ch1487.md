## Chapter 1487 — Into the Depths

Judging by the way the man and woman sat meditating so close together, they looked like a married couple; otherwise they would not be so intimate. Yet their appearances presented a striking visual contrast, as if a beauty had paired with a beast.

Sensing someone's arrival, the three opened their eyes in unison. When they saw Elder Jiang return with company, all of them turned their gazes to Yang Kai, sizing him up from head to toe.

"Brother Jiang, why were you gone so long? I thought something had gone wrong," the elder who had been meditating asked with some impatience.

Elder Jiang chuckled and explained, "No such thing. It's just that suitable candidates are hard to find; this old man only just managed to find this young brother."

The right candidate was indeed hard to find. What he needed was a cultivator who practiced fire-attributed Saint Yuan, whose strength could not be too low—otherwise they wouldn’t meet the requirements—but also not too high, for such a person would be difficult to restrain. Should they harbor any ill intentions once the deed was done, that would bring no small amount of trouble.

Thus the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm or the Second Stage was the best choice.

Moreover, most martial artists who came to the outskirts of the Fallen Emperor Mountains traveled in groups, so finding a solitary one was naturally difficult. Elder Jiang wandered around for two or three days, questioned more than ten people in total, and only then encountered Yang Kai, who met his requirements.

“Only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm?” the rugged, wild-looking man gave a cold snort. “Isn’t that a bit weak? If the barrier over there is really that hard to break, can he even handle it? Don’t let him hold us back and waste everyone’s time for nothing.”

He himself was also only at the Second Stage, but still a cut above Yang Kai, so his tone carried a certain condescension.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, unconcerned.

Elder Jiang hurriedly replied, "First Stage is no impediment. Although this young brother's cultivation is slightly inferior, he can take some pills to supplement his Saint Yuan, and that formation's breaking isn't actually that difficult so long as the number of people breaking it meets the requirement. It's just a trifle; but if the requirement isn't met, then no matter how strong one is, it cannot be broken."

“Since Elder Jiang says so, then it’s fine.” The burly man dropped the matter without further argument.

“Elder Jiang, since everyone’s here, shouldn’t we set out now? You said that place is quite remote and unlikely to be discovered, but more and more people are pouring into the Fallen Emperor Mountains. Better safe than sorry—if we leave early, we’ll arrive early.” The petite woman parted her rosy lips as she spoke, her voice crisp and tender, carrying a hint of childish sweetness. From her tone alone, one would hardly imagine her to be a powerhouse of the Origin Returning Realm.

"Madam Yi is right. Since everyone is present, let's go then." Elder Jiang did not say much; after a brief remark he immediately summoned a Star Shuttle and led the way into the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

The other four exchanged glances and hurried to follow.

Along the way they exchanged brief introductions—after all they would be cooperating, and being total strangers wasn't ideal, though there was no need for excessive detail. Yang Kai only learned that the elder who found him was surnamed Jiang, the other elder in gray was surnamed He, and the beast-and-beauty couple were surnamed Chen for the man and Yi for the woman.

This suited Yang Kai perfectly.

After all, his reputation on Dark Star was at its height. If he announced his full name, these people would surely make many connections; by only giving his surname he saved himself a lot of trouble.

The reason Elder Jiang wanted to gather five people to storm the Fallen Emperor Mountains was that some days ago he had inadvertently discovered an ancient martial artist's cave within the range. However, the cave was protected by a mysterious formation; after several days of effort he couldn't break it, and, with no choice, he had to withdraw from the Fallen Emperor Mountains to seek helpers.

Fortunately he had some knowledge of formations. Though those days' efforts hadn't broken the formation, they had revealed some hints, and after consulting certain ancient texts he finally confirmed it was the long-lost Five Elements spirit formation.

This formation grew stronger when met with strength and weaker when met with weakness; it was exceedingly mysterious and hard to break. However, if five martial artists cultivating metal, wood, water, fire, and earth Saint Yuan could be gathered to exert force together, there would be a chance to break it.

If the formation were at its full power, then one would need to assemble five Void King Realm experts to effortlessly shatter it. But the ancient cave dated back tens of thousands of years and the formation's potency had greatly diminished, so now gathering five Origin Returning Realm practitioners was sufficient.

After withdrawing from the Fallen Emperor Mountains and making considerable effort, Elder Jiang finally found three suitable candidates, and Yang Kai was the last one.

Yang Kai had become interested and followed him here only after Jiang transmitted to him that there was an ancient martial artist's cave.

Besides, he was going into the Fallen Emperor Mountains anyway, so this was just along the way. If there were gains, all the better; if not, it didn't matter. His attitude was calm, far from the fanaticism of the other four.

"I'll say what needs saying first," Elder Jiang said seriously after recounting the cave and the Five Elements spirit formation's situation. "Once the seal is broken, if anything is found within that cave, this old man will take forty percent of the proceeds, and the remaining sixty percent will be split among you."

"Forty percent?" Elder He raised his brow, considered a moment, then nodded, "Brother Jiang, this distribution is fair; this old one has no objections."

Chen the burly man and the delicate beauty called Madam Yi naturally had no objections either.

Although the five would act together, the ancient cave had after all been discovered by Elder Jiang, and the method to break it was provided by him; the others were only contributing labor, so his demand to take forty percent was not excessive.

Although Yang Kai rarely teamed up with others for outside adventures, he understood such distribution rules. He knew Jiang had not made an exorbitant demand—had he wanted half no one would protest—so taking only forty percent showed Elder Jiang was reasonable.

"If there isn't enough to distribute, what then?" Yang Kai asked.

"If there's not enough to divide, it will be converted into Saint Crystals, or auctioned on the spot—the highest bidder gets it, and everyone distributes those Saint Crystals afterward," the beauty, who was called Madam Yi, said with a smile as she looked at Yang Kai. "Young brother, you seldom travel outside, do you? Rarely team up with strangers to hunt treasures?"

"Yes," Yang Kai answered, a little embarrassed; he vaguely felt he had asked about a customary rule everyone already knew.

"No wonder!" Madam Yi giggled coquettishly.

Elder Jiang smiled kindly and said, "Seeing young brother Yang so young yet already at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, one would suppose he hails from a great sect; it's inevitable he'd be unaware of some of these customary rules."

"Hmph, a flower raised in a greenhouse that can't withstand wind and rain. Boy, you'll drop the ball when it matters," Chen the burly man sneered; he had long looked down on Yang Kai's strength and distrusted him, and couldn't resist a few barbed words.

As soon as the words left his mouth, Madam Yi gave him a sharp yank.

Yang Kai cleared his throat and immediately fell silent.

Having weathered so many storms to reach his current achievements, being labeled a greenhouse flower by strangers left him speechless. But he was too lazy to argue; they were passing acquaintances who might never meet again after this collaboration, so explaining was pointless.

The five continued on. At first, on the outskirts of the Fallen Emperor Mountains they still encountered a variety of martial artists advancing together toward the range, but once they sensed the energy fluctuations emanating from the five, they all kept well away.

After all, five Origin Returning Realm practitioners together were a formidable force; who knew the tempers of these five? If one ran afoul of them it would be courting death.

However, as time passed the party walked ever deeper into remote areas, and gradually no other martial artists were to be seen.

The Fallen Emperor Mountains were vast. Though tens of thousands had poured in, once dispersed there were few opportunities to encounter each other.

And just one day after Yang Kai entered the Fallen Emperor Mountains, a group of a dozen or so descended on the outskirts.

A heavy pressure descended from the sky; the noisy outskirts of the Fallen Emperor Mountains suddenly fell silent, and everyone's eyes turned toward that party of a dozen or so.

Among them the leaders were two: one was a middle-aged man in a blue robe with a burly, imposing frame; the other wore a green robe—though not as heavily built, his aura was every bit as powerful as the blue-robed man's.

Their Divine Sense swept across a hundred-mile radius, and the blue-robed man frowned, "Not here."

The green-robed man smiled faintly, took out a Transmission Compass and poured Divine Sense into it as if communicating with someone. After a moment he put the compass away and said, "Brother Qu, that kid entered the Fallen Emperor Mountains a day ago."

"He's already gone in?" the blue-robed man asked, frowning, eyes flashing. He slowly nodded, "Good. This matter shouldn't be delayed; let's go in too."

"Mm, I didn't expect such developments in the Fallen Emperor Mountains, but it actually suits our purposes; otherwise we'd have to hide our tracks and it would be too troublesome," the green-robed man said with a slight smile.

The dozen or so lingered only a moment before charging straight into the Fallen Emperor Mountains, vanishing in an instant.

After they left, the tens of thousands on the outskirts of the Fallen Emperor Mountains finally breathed big gasps of relief.

"Battle Sky Alliance's Alliance Master Qu Zheng, and Leitai Sect's Sect Master Fang Peng! Since when have these two joined forces? Aren't they mortal enemies?" someone exclaimed, clearly recognizing the two.

"What's so surprising? Opportunities abound in the Fallen Emperor Mountains now and there's much to gain; they simply temporarily joined forces for profit. This has happened before."

"Friend has a point. The experts from these two great powers have come—looks like that ancient sect's Protective Mountain Array is about to be breached."

"What are you hesitating for? Hurry and follow them," the speaker's expression changed as he quickly packed up his stall and charged into the Fallen Emperor Mountains behind the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect's strong members.

"If others get the meat, we can follow and sip the broth. Opportunities and risks always coexist; with a bit of care one might still reap some benefits."
