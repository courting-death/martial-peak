## Chapter 1105 — Give You One Chance to Prove Yourself

Yang Flame was a very strange woman; aside from her interest in high-grade Secret Treasures, her greatest obsession was Saint Crystals. Every time Yang Kai passed by her stone chamber, he would see her counting her Saint Crystals one by one, tirelessly.

She polished the stains off those Lower-Level Saint Crystals until they gleamed; the bright shimmer seemed to give her immense satisfaction. Whenever this happened, a wild smile would spread across Yang Flame's face. If she caught Yang Kai looking at her with that odd expression, she'd quickly tuck the Saint Crystal away as if afraid he'd snatch it.

This woman has gone mad! Yang Kai decided in his heart.

As time passed, fewer and fewer people came to the cave seeking Yang Flame's forging services. The visitors' needs had been met, and Yang Flame's business gradually dried up.

One day, Yang Kai was meditating when he suddenly heard Wu Yi calling from outside.

Wu Yi had been busy with unknown matters recently and hadn't appeared for a while. Hearing her voice, Yang Kai stepped out of the cave and saw her standing there like a graceful statue; he hurriedly greeted her with a smile.

"How's this place?" Wu Yi asked with a smile.

"Very good." Yang Kai nodded, studying her expression and noticing she seemed somewhat unhappy.

"I heard from Yu Feng that you and a woman set up a spirit formation here?" Wu Yi turned to sense the surrounding Spiritual Qi, inhaled deeply and said, "The effect seems quite good. Had I known this place was so fine, I should have had someone set up formations long ago. Yu Feng and the others still need to contribute or pay with Saint Crystals to use the family's cultivation rooms."

"Regret it?" Yang Kai looked at her leisurely.

Wu Yi rolled her eyes and teased, "Am I that petty? If I said I'd give this mountain away, then it's yours. If it becomes better, that's not my concern. Live here in peace; no one will dare trouble you."

Yang Kai was about to say more when he frowned and turned to look in a direction. A green light flickered there; someone was riding a Star Shuttle, flitting back and forth above Dragon Lair Mountain, apparently inspecting something.

"Someone from your family?" Yang Kai asked, watching the figure.

"Mm, one of my family's stewards. Ignore him." Wu Yi looked displeased. "He came this time looking for that artificer called Yang Flame."

"What does he want with her?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"She's an artificer—what else would they want?" Wu Yi smiled, pursing her lips. "For a small family like ours, cultivating an artificer isn't easy. A wandering artificer, even if young, is worth recruiting. The disciples say she can craft and refine Saint-Grade Secret Treasures."

Recently, the martial artists coming to see Wu Yi were not powerful—at most people like Yu Feng. The Secret Treasures they wanted forged and refined weren't of high rank, so the Haike Family assumed Yang Flame was a Saint-Grade artificer.

Any lone artificer nearby draws attention; regardless of their actual rank, the Haike Family wanted to show sincerity—they might gain huge benefits for the clan—so they sent someone.

"What's your relationship with that woman? I thought you said you didn't know anyone around here—how did you manage to bring back a beauty so fast?" Wu Yi teased Yang Kai, as if certain there was something illicit between him and Yang Flame.

"I'm not close to her. I only asked her to help set up the formation; then she just stayed. I couldn't bring myself to kick her out. If your family can recruit her, great—I'm fed up with her." Yang Kai complained.

"Whether she'll join depends on her own mind; that's not my business. I came to see how you're doing." Wu Yi smiled coyly and didn't pry further.

A moment later the Haike Family steward flew over, nodded to Wu Yi and said, "The mountain's Spiritual Qi is decent; give it a year or two and it might improve further. I heard Miss gave this mountain to someone—did you give it to him?"

As he spoke he glanced at Yang Kai with contempt.

Wu Yi frowned and said, "Uncle Zhou, you're not here for the mountain—do you have another matter?"

The martial artist surnamed Zhou smiled, "I only asked casually; Miss needn't mind."

He shot another look at Yang Kai, then folded his hands behind his back and sauntered into the cave with an air of superiority.

"They have to meddle in everything—so annoying. They didn’t care before. Our family owns tens of thousands of square li, yet because I'm a woman they assigned this barren mountain to me. Now they see profit and want a hand in it—infuriating." Wu Yi said angrily.

Yang Kai remained silent; he had no right to comment on the internal matters of another family.

Wu Yi stopped complaining and chatted with Yang Kai about recent life, smiling and asking if he needed anything.

The two had a pleasant conversation. Wu Yi daydreamed about her ambitions, her eyes full of expectation.

Half a teacup later, the Zhou steward stormed out of the cave, fuming, "That little brat has no gratitude—hm, she really thinks herself something. She's only a Saint-Grade artificer; does the Haike Family not know how to cultivate one? Claiming to be an Origin-Grade artificer—what a joke!"

He left in annoyance without greeting Wu Yi, urging his Star Shuttle to leave.

Wu Yi's lips parted; she hadn't expected Yang Flame to refuse the family's offer. She had seen the contract on her visit and thought the terms were decent—though not comparable to a great force like Yingyue Hall, they were good for a minor power.

"The woman you brought back seems to ask a lot." Wu Yi looked at Yang Kai. "Zhou said she claims to be an Origin-Grade artificer? Isn't she only in her twenties?"

"I don't know. She calls herself an Origin-Grade artificer." Yang Kai shook his head.

"Interesting." Wu Yi pursed her lips and smiled. "Well, an artificer has the right to choose. But people who talk so casually aren't likable. I have other matters—I'll visit again later."

After bidding Wu Yi farewell, Yang Kai thought a moment, returned into the cave, and walked into Yang Flame's stone chamber.

Yang Flame glared at Yang Kai with puckered lips, clearly displeased. "Why does no one believe I'm an Origin-Grade artificer?"

"How do you expect them to believe you?" Yang Kai rubbed his forehead.

"Give me one chance to prove it! If they bring me some Origin-Grade materials, I guarantee I can forge an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure." Yang Flame protested, her chest heaving with grievance.

"Do you think Origin-Grade materials are cheap? Only great forces can get that rank of material. The Haike Family is small; even if they had some, it's extremely scarce. Why would they lightly use it to test your skill? What if you ruin their materials? If I told you I'm a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level alchemist, would you believe me?" Yang Kai asked seriously.

Yang Flame's beautiful eyes flickered as she sized him up, snorting, "You?"

Then she burst into laughter as though she'd heard the world's funniest joke.

Yang Kai’s face turned pitch-black.

He suddenly understood why no one believed Yang Flame—just as Yang Flame didn't believe his words; they were both too young for such lofty titles. Saint King-Grade alchemists and Origin-Grade artificers were rarely young.

Realizing this, Yang Kai suspected Yang Flame might not be lying or falsely inflating her status—she might truly possess such skills.

"I'll ask you seriously once more: are you really an Origin-Grade artificer?" Yang Kai's gaze burned on her.

"Don't make me repeat the title all the time. Whether I am or not, just bring me the materials. Or let me refine your Star Shuttle or those seven small flags. If I fail, do whatever you like!" she said.

"You only have that body and nothing else of value." Yang Kai scoffed, "Selling you wouldn't even cover the loss from a failed refinement."

Yang Flame immediately bit down on her silver teeth until they clicked.

"What would you make from these materials?" Yang Kai waved his hand and a pile of materials suddenly appeared before Yang Flame.

He felt it was time to test the woman's true skill.

Yang Flame, grinding her teeth and glaring at Yang Kai, suddenly widened her eyes and, abandoning all decorum, pounced on the materials with delight. She cried out as she picked up item after item: "Eighth-Tier demonic beast Thunder Cloud Leopard's tooth, the single horn of the Scorchfire Biyan Rhinoceros, the wings of the Illusory Cloud Butterfly, my god, and the tendrils of the Adamant Dragon Beetle..."

Each item she picked up she could name precisely and where it came from. In an instant she slipped into a frenzy, ignoring the foul smells emanating from some specimens, cradling them like treasures. Her small arms were full; she kept picking things up from the ground, dropping one, picking another, utterly flustered.

As she grabbed and named them, Yang Kai suddenly saw her eyes redden. Tears the size of beans rolled from the corners of her eyes down her cheeks to her chin.

"Why are you crying?" Yang Kai was speechless—he realized this woman's mind was indeed a little off.

"I haven't seen so many precious materials in a long time..." Yang Flame's delicate shoulder trembled and she choked on her words, "They all think I'm a liar. They only bring materials below Saint-Grade, and the Secret Treasures they offer are the same. I'm not lying."

"Don't cry. I'll give you a chance to prove yourself. I don't care what you refine or into what form—these materials are all yours to use."

"Really?" Yang Flame lifted her head, eyes red as she looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and said indifferently, “I, too, want to know whether you were exaggerating.”
