## Chapter 2115 — The Firmament Tree

After refining the True Dragon’s blood and displaying the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, there was a clear difference from before.

The first difference was that what had been a single dragon claw had become a pair.

The might of the dragon claws was unstoppable; they could break through anything and contend head-on with Secret Treasures equal to Yang Kai’s strength. Naturally, two dragon claws were far more powerful than one.

The second obvious difference was, of course, the change in the dragon scales.

Previously, the dragon scales on his arms had also manifested from his own power, but they were not fiery red. Now, however, there was a trace of a Fire Dragon’s aura, making them clearly sturdier. The dragon scale armor that appeared on his chest also provided Yang Kai with extremely strong defense.

Just refining a single drop of True Dragon’s blood had such miraculous effects. If he could fully refine the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade into his body, what kind of transformation would occur then?

Thinking of this, Yang Kai’s heart burned with excitement. With a thought, he dispersed the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique and sat down cross-legged once more.

Refining dragon blood was relatively simple—he could just swallow it directly. But the Dragon Bone Sword was different; it was a section of Dragon Spine Bone and could not be handled the same way.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had previously performed a rough sacrificial refining, so he could store it within his body.

So he only needed some time to fuse with it slowly.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai separated the two materials within the Dragon Bone Sword—the Dragon Spine Bone and the Dragon Pearl—and moved them into his body, gradually refining them.

……

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, all was tranquil. A hurried month passed in a flash.

During this month, people kept coming from Fenglin City to visit Yang Kai. Mo Xiaoqi came most often, followed by Kang Siran. Of course, there were also people from the City Lord’s Mansion and Dao Origin Realm Patriarchs from other families.

However, after receiving a message from Yang Kai that he was in seclusion and would not receive guests, the Zhang Family matron could only steel herself to keep these visitors outside.

Mo Xiaoqi, Kang Siran, Duan Yuanshan, Qin Chaoyang, and the others were easy to talk to. Once they heard Yang Kai was in seclusion, they did not insist, instead expressing concern for his well-being. After a few visits, the Zhang Family became quite familiar with several Dao Origin Realm experts and received much care from them.

But the Dao Origin Realm Patriarchs from other families were not so pleasant.

Each came with high spirits, hoping to win over Yang Kai and invite him to serve as an elder or guest elder for their clan. Yet they were blocked by an old woman at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, and naturally felt snubbed.

The Zhang Family’s old woman and the beautiful matron, though terrified, could only force a smile and explain.

After several attempts, no one came again.

Fortunately, although these Dao Origin Realm experts were displeased with the Zhang Family’s hospitality, with the City Lord’s Mansion offering protection, they did not dare make things too difficult for these widows and orphans. Otherwise, with the Zhang Family’s current strength, how could they have survived in peace?

A month later, Yang Kai emerged from seclusion safe and sound.

The Zhang Family members, upon hearing the news, all came to see him.

After some words of concern, the old woman said, “So you know, my lord, while you were in seclusion, many people came to visit.”

“I know,” Yang Kai replied, not asking who, as he could guess.

“Also, Shopkeeper Kang from the Spiritual Pill Shop and that girl named Mo Xiaoqi each left a jade slip for you.” As she spoke, the old woman signaled to Zhang Ruoxi.

Zhang Ruoxi understood and respectfully handed over the two jade slips, then stood quietly at Yang Kai’s side with her head lowered.

Yang Kai took the jade slips, picked up one, swept it with his Divine Sense, and smiled, “So Brother Kang really was transferred…”

The Zhang Family’s old woman nodded, “Yes, my lord. It seems Shopkeeper Kang received a transfer order from the Ziyuan Commerce Guild headquarters and left Fenglin City half a month ago. Before leaving, he stayed at our Zhang Family for several days, hoping to see you one last time, but unfortunately, you were in seclusion the whole time.”

“Fate will bring us together again!” Yang Kai smiled.

He had long suspected Kang Siran would be transferred.

After all, Fenglin City was too small. Now that Kang Siran had reached the Dao Origin Realm, it was no longer suitable for him to manage a small shop in such a place. The Ziyuan Commerce Guild would surely send him somewhere he was more needed.

Kang Siran had no choice in the matter. As a member of the Commerce Guild, he could not disobey a headquarters order unless he defected from the Ziyuan Commerce Guild. But if he did that, he would have nowhere to stand in the entire Southern Territory.

“Before leaving, Shopkeeper Kang said he doesn’t yet know where he’ll be sent. Once it’s decided, he’ll have someone inform you. He also said that if you ever need him, just let him know—no matter how far, he’ll come to help you! He only regrets not being able to say goodbye in person and hopes you’ll understand,” the Zhang Family’s old woman reported.

Yang Kai nodded. Kang Siran was indeed thoughtful. After all, it was a Dao Origin Pill from him that enabled Kang Siran’s current cultivation, so he was naturally grateful.

Without saying more, Yang Kai immersed his Divine Sense into the other jade slip. After reading the message left within, he was left dumbfounded: “Xiaoqi left too?”

The message in the jade slip was simple—just a single sentence.

“Damn it, Big Brother Yang, you’re still in seclusion—I can’t even see you one last time! I have to go, Aunt Feng is here to catch me. If I don’t run now, it’ll be too late…”

Mo Xiaoqi’s origins were mysterious, but Yang Kai could guess she was definitely from an extraordinary background. Judging from the message she left, it seemed someone from her family had come to take her back…

Yang Kai couldn’t help but imagine a scene—a rebellious young girl running away from home, wandering outside, finally discovered, and then chased down by her clan’s experts, who eventually forced her to surrender and took her back.

“Poor Xiaoqi…” Yang Kai sighed, feeling sympathy for her, but not worried.

Since it was her family who came to take her back, they surely wouldn’t harm her.

Besides… that so-called Aunt Feng, Yang Kai had heard Mo Xiaoqi mention her once before. The two seemed very close, as Mo Xiaoqi had said Aunt Feng told her many stories.

After just over a month in seclusion, two friends had left Fenglin City, both forced by circumstances. This made Yang Kai sigh at the fickleness of the world.

Crushing the two jade slips, Yang Kai looked at the old woman and asked, “Other than that, is there anything else?”

The old woman replied, “Someone from the Qin Family sent word. If you’re out of seclusion, please visit the Qin Family. They say the answer to your question has been found.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up with joy. “Good, I’ll go to the Qin Family right away.”

With that, he stood up.

Zhang Ruoxi hurriedly said, “Sir… do you need me to go with you?”

Yang Kai replied, “No need. Stay here and cultivate.”

“Then… take care, Sir.” A trace of sadness flashed in Zhang Ruoxi’s eyes, but recalling her experience with the Ethereal Jade Disc last time, a surge of determination rose within her.

Without enough cultivation, she simply could not help Yang Kai. Only by improving her strength could she help him unravel the secret of the Ethereal Jade Disc.

In the main hall, Yang Kai took a step forward.

Before his foot even landed, his figure had already vanished.

Moments later, he arrived at the Qin Family in Fenglin City.

This time, he did not enter directly, but stood outside and released his Divine Sense.

In the next instant, a hearty laugh rang out from within the Qin Family: “Brother Yang, you’re finally out of seclusion!”

As the voice fell, Qin Chaoyang’s figure appeared in Yang Kai’s sight, rushing over like wind and lightning. After looking Yang Kai up and down, his eyes narrowed slightly, “Brother Yang, it seems you’ve gained a lot from this seclusion!”

He couldn’t say why, but although Yang Kai’s cultivation and realm hadn’t improved at all, he seemed much stronger than before, and his aura was much denser.

Qin Chaoyang immediately understood that Yang Kai must have cultivated some secret technique during his month-long seclusion.

He didn’t press for details, nor did he wait for Yang Kai to answer, but enthusiastically said, “Come, come, please come in!”

Yang Kai smiled and followed Qin Chaoyang into the Qin Family.

Along the way, all the Qin Family members they passed bowed respectfully, not daring to show the slightest neglect.

To Yang Kai’s surprise, Qin Chaoyang did not take him to the main hall, but led him straight to the secret chamber.

Arriving at the secret chamber, Qin Chaoyang whispered with a smile, “Brother Yang, I know you asked Yu’er a question before. It seems she’s found the answer and is inside now. Go in and talk with her in detail. Once things are settled, I’ll come catch up with you! Oh, and let me assure you, whatever you asked Yu’er, she hasn’t told me a word.”

“I trust Miss Qin!” Yang Kai nodded gently and pushed the door open.

It was still the same secret chamber as before. Qin Yu seemed to have been waiting for a long time. When Yang Kai entered, she quickly stood up and saluted.

“Miss Qin, there’s no need to be so formal—we’re not strangers.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

“Courtesy must not be neglected!” Qin Yu smiled slightly.

Yang Kai smiled at her, but his expression suddenly became a bit strange. His gaze lingered on her face for a few moments, and his brows furrowed slightly, as if he had discovered something.

Qin Yu did not notice at all, and instead said, “Previously, you asked me what that gold-and-silver two-colored anomalous tree was. Over these days, I searched through the ancestral records and finally found its origin.”

“Let’s hear it,” Yang Kai suppressed his excitement and asked calmly.

“Before that, I have a question for you,” Qin Yu said.

“What is it?”

“In the scene you saw, did that gold-and-silver two-colored anomalous tree display any strange powers?”

“Why do you ask?” Yang Kai frowned.

“At the dawning of Heaven and Earth, when all was murky and unshaped, time and space unsettled, there arose a wondrous tree to uphold the Firmament, born in accord with fate. With the chaotic force of Yin and Yang, it sealed the Four Poles, suppressed the yawning void, bound a realm of Heaven and Earth within its shadow, and trapped the Four Seas in a vast cage…”

Qin Yu’s voice was low and mysterious. As she spoke, silver light flickered in her eyes, making her seem extremely enigmatic.

“Only when mighty beings displayed their divine powers and shattered the void’s restraints, breaking free of that cage and hewing the Firmament Tree across the heavens, did the tides of worldly force surge for the first time. In that distant age, countless peerless figures emerged in succession, each revealing their own wonders, contending for supremacy.”
