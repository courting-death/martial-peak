## Chapter 1565 — Huiyue City

Yang Kai's immediate priority now was to gather intelligence.

Finding Shan Qingluo should be easy enough; since she is the adopted daughter of Lady Chi Yue, she would almost certainly be with Lady Chi Yue.

When they parted at the Imperial Garden all those years ago, Shan Qingluo's heart‑rending cries still echoed in Yang Kai's ears.

Since he had come to Yao Star Di Chen, he naturally had to see whether that enchantress was living well.

Within a few days, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang had flown out of that deep mountain forest, but along the way, although Yang Kai encountered many creatures, they were only uncivilized demonic beasts, from whom he could learn nothing — much to his frustration.

He could only pin his hopes on the road ahead.

As he and Xia Ningshang flew on aimlessly, Yang Kai extended his Divine Sense to probe the surrounding area.

After a while, he seemed to find something and pointed in a direction. “There’s some movement over there. Let’s go take a look.”

“Alright.” Xia Ningshang had no objection.

The two landed and walked side by side toward where Yang Kai had pointed. Before long, the forms of about a dozen martial practitioners came into view.

These fighters gave off a wild aura, their internal energy signatures differing greatly from those of normal human warriors, and each of them more or less possessed some bodily features of demonic beasts.

This band of a dozen or so were clearly yao!

Beneath them were wolf-shaped Demonic Beasts clad in golden armor, sharp and imposing. They urged their mounts forward in a wild gallop—though only a dozen or so in number, they charged like a torrent of steel, their momentum overwhelming.

Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense over them and discovered the strongest among these yao warriors was only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. Not worth fearing.

So he walked forward openly with Xia Ningshang.

“Pardon the intrusion.” When he drew near, he cupped his fist at the leader, a warm smile on his face.

The other party had clearly already noticed them. The leader leaped down from his wolf‑like mount and looked down at him from above; those slightly pale eyes held a natural disdain and appraisal.

The mount snorted and breathed a foul stench toward Yang Kai, even trying to thrust its head forward as if to taste whether Yang Kai was palatable…

Yang Kai smiled and remained unmoved.

This was Di Chen Star; it was the yao's domain, so yao naturally carried a born sense of superiority when facing other races. They believed no other race could compare to the supreme yao, and any race before powerful yao could only bow and grovel, be servants and slaves!

“Humans?” The leader cast a sideways glance at Yang Kai and immediately recognized their identity.

The wolf‑like mount sniffed, sensing its master's displeasure, and circled around Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang.

Once back in place, the yao warrior snorted coldly. “What are you two humans doing here?”

“Heh. We got a bit lost. May I ask where this place is?”

“This is the Red Moon Domain!” The yao boastingly replied. “It is governed by the great Lady Chi Yue. You wandered here without knowing where it is?”

“Ah. I know this is Lady Chi Yue's Domain.” Yang Kai chuckled. “What I want to ask is: where is the nearest city? If it's convenient, could you tell me where Lady Chi Yue's palace is?”

“You want the location of the Lady's palace?” The yao glared at Yang Kai, his expression turning cold and increasingly hostile. “Why are you asking about that?”

“Nothing much. A friend of mine is in Lady Chi Yue's palace and I want to see her.” Yang Kai replied casually.

“Friend…” The yao paused, then burst into loud laughter filled with mockery, and the others joined in.

“Human, I advise you to give up. The Lady's palace cannot be approached without summons; even we yao would not dare, let alone you humans! But rest assured, the Lady has always been merciful to humans. Your friend who serves in the palace should be living comfortably.”

He had assumed the friend Yang Kai mentioned was an insignificant person inside Lady Chi Yue's palace.

That was normal: humans in the Lady's palace were selected beauties and handsome youths who served only as menial help.

In yao territory, humans never had status.

“Mm, thanks for the reminder. I still want to know where Lady Chi Yue's palace is.” Yang Kai persisted.

“Humans all act so arrogant, that's why I hate them!” the yao snorted, proudly saying, “I’ll tell you, but it won’t be for free — pay up.”

“Fine!” Yang Kai nodded and casually tossed out a pack of Saint Crystals.

The yao accepted it, opened it, and suddenly went mad with joy, exclaiming, “Upper‑Level Saint Crystals!”

At that, many of the yao displayed greedy expressions, eyeing the package and then Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang.

Some ill intentions were mixed in those looks.

“Now can you tell me?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

“Hm, you humans have some sense. I’ll tell you.” The yao pondered a moment, then calmed and began to give Yang Kai the information he needed.

After a short while, Yang Kai cupped his fists at the group and, with Xia Ningshang, left calmly.

“Lord, that human looks very wealthy. Why let them go?” a younger‑looking yao warrior asked the leader suspiciously.

“Hmph, did you think I can’t see his wealth?”

“Then why not detain them? In these wilds, even if Lady Chi Yue forbids us from killing humans, no one would know if we did.”

“Idiot! If we make a move, the ones who die won’t be those two, it will be us.”

“Uh… Lord, that can’t be, can it?” the yao youth found it hard to believe.

“There’s nothing impossible about it. He may be wealthy, but when faced with so many of us, did he show the slightest fear? Even the human woman at his side remained unalarmed. What does that mean? It means those two don’t regard us at all! You fool only saw the shine of the Saint Crystals and ignored their strength. Precisely because this is a wild place, I dare not act rashly, otherwise…”

Hearing this, the yao youth broke into a cold sweat and looked after Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang with reluctance, sighing, “That woman looks tender and delicate — if only we could take a bite…”

Some yao warriors were transformed demonic beasts and still retained the habit of tearing flesh and drinking blood.

But overall such transformed warriors were not many. More yao warriors were born human in form, only retaining traces of demonic beasts.

This young yao was clearly one who had transformed from a demonic beast, so he wasn’t interested in the face hidden beneath Xia Ningshang's black veil; rather, he ogled her fair skin and pure flesh.

Human flesh has always been delicious, especially the flesh of young human maidens…

“Enough nonsense. The Young Master of the Thousand-Eyed Lord should already be on his way. Our task is to track his movements and report back — the Lady will send people to receive him. We can’t afford the slightest mistake.” The yao cultivator spoke in a low, heavy voice, but soon a shadow crossed his brow. Gritting his teeth, he muttered darkly, “Who knows how many women from the surrounding territories will suffer under that Young Master’s hands this time…”

Upon mentioning the Young Master of the Thousand-Eyed Lord, all the yao fell silent, as if fearful of that fellow.

……

“Junior Brother, what should we do now?” Xia Ningshang whispered behind Yang Kai.

“First go to the nearest city.” Yang Kai sighed. Although he had easily obtained the location of Lady Chi Yue's palace from the yao, it was impossible to go there to find Shan Qingluo.

The warrior made it perfectly clear: without a summons, no one may approach the Lady's palace — otherwise they will be killed without mercy.

Even the yao would not dare to cross that line, let alone Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang who were human.

One of the ten great Lords on Di Chen Star — Chi Yue — resided in that palace. Even Yang Kai, confident as he was, would not act rashly before her; she was a Void King Realm expert, and Biluo had said she might even be at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

Charging in would be courting death!

He needed a plan, preferably a way to send a message to Shan Qingluo to have her come out to see him.

Yang Kai fell into thought.

A day later, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang arrived before a yao city.

Huiyue City differed somewhat from the cities Yang Kai had seen before. Its buildings displayed the yao's crude and wild style, not refined, but presenting a bold, impressive spectacle.

The city was not solely inhabited by yao; human figures came and went as well.

Lady Chi Yue had done better than other Lords in this respect: on her domain, no yao could kill humans without reason. Although humans ranked low, they had their own advantages — Lady Chi Yue recognized these advantages and thus afforded humans space to survive.

The other nine Lords were not as farsighted as she.

Especially the most bloodthirsty, Lord Kuang Shi; in his territory no human traces remained. His men upheld the Lord's doctrine: see a human, kill and feast.

As a result, humans in his domain fled in droves and swarmed into Red Moon Domain, which were comparatively safe for humans.

Overall, Huiyue City saw humans and yao living in relative harmony, though humans remained subordinate.
