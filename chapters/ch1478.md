## Chapter 1478 — Slumber

Using the Space Array outside the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai easily arrived at the Lingxiao Sect's main headquarters.

From the moment he appeared from the palace on the other side, the disciples on duty instantly assumed defensive positions; when they recognized Yang Kai's return, they were overjoyed and hurriedly bowed.

"Has Yang Yan and Elder Ye returned?" Yang Kai asked urgently.

"Reporting to the Sect Master, Vice Sect Master Yang Yan and Great Elder Ye returned five days ago," a quick‑witted disciple hurriedly replied.

Yang Kai could not help but breathe a sigh of relief; although he felt Yang Yan and Ye Xijun were probably unharmed, he always remained anxious until he had concrete news—now that he knew they had returned safely, that worry fell away.

"However, when they returned, Vice Sect Master Yang Yan seemed to be unconscious; she was carried back by the Great Elder," the disciple added cautiously.

"What?" Yang Kai was startled and pressed for more information, but the disciple knew nothing further and could not say what kind of injury had left Yang Yan unconscious or whether there was lasting harm.

"This is nothing for you to concern yourselves with; keep guarding here." Helpless, Yang Kai could only leave quickly and head straight for the Hundred Flowers Residence where Yang Yan had previously lived.

Halfway there, Wu Yi and Qian Yue came out to meet him; they had obviously learned of Yang Kai's return.

The anxiety on the two women's faces was plain; on seeing Yang Kai they called out to him in alarm.

"I've heard a little about the situation—do you know how Yang Yan was injured? Is it serious?" Yang Kai asked as he came before them.

Both shook their heads; Qian Yue said, "Since they returned, the Great Elder has not appeared before others, so we have no way to inquire about the situation."

"Calm down; I'll go see for myself." Yang Kai frowned.

"They are not in the Hundred Flowers Residence now," Wu Yi quickly grabbed Yang Kai.

"Then where are they?" Yang Kai looked astonished.

"On the Sixth Layer……"

"The Sixth Layer!" Yang Kai's brow knit tighter; he knew exactly what the Sixth Layer referred to—the very center of the Flowing Flame Sandland, where that small bamboo tower stood, the place the Great Emperor would normally cultivate in seclusion. But why had they gone to the Sixth Layer? Could the Great Emperor truly have awakened?

A sudden unease rose in Yang Kai's heart.

Pausing in thought for a moment, Yang Kai drew a deep breath. "I'll go take a look. By the way, Wu Yi, you should be familiar with Guest Elder Huang Juan. I happened to meet her on my way back and invited her to join the Lingxiao Sect; she is now part of the sect—please make the arrangements."

"Yes!" Wu Yi promptly nodded; she had met Huang Juan earlier but had been preoccupied with Yang Yan's condition and had no chance to greet her. Hearing Yang Kai's instruction, she accepted it without hesitation.

Yang Kai's figure flickered, and he vanished, heading straight for the Sixth Layer.

The Lingxiao Sect was located on the Fourth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland; between it and the Sixth Layer lay the Heat‑Flame Zone, the most violent layer. But Yang Kai bore the Star Emperor Token's protection, so he had little to fear.

It took only half a day for him to arrive before the bamboo tower on the Sixth Layer.

As if long expecting Yang Kai's arrival, Ye Xijun was already waiting in front of the bamboo tower; when she saw him, a complex expression crossed her beautiful eyes, and she bowed gracefully: "Subordinate greets the Sect Master."

"Yang Yan is inside, right?" Yang Kai asked as he stepped forward.

Unexpectedly, Ye Xijun moved and directly blocked Yang Kai's path, as if forbidding him to approach.

"What do you mean by that?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and fixed Ye Xijun with a cold look.

"Sect Master, I beg your forgiveness; the Lord has ordered that she see no one now," Ye Xijun answered with an impassive expression, neither servile nor arrogant.

"Not even me?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Yes." Ye Xijun bowed her head slightly. "I am only carrying out the Lord's orders; I beg the Sect Master not to put me in a difficult position."

"Put you in a difficult position?" Yang Kai gave a hollow laugh. "How interesting... What is there about my going to see her that would put you in difficulty? It's not as if we haven't met before."

"Please forgive me, Sect Master!" Ye Xijun stubbornly remained in front of him.

Yang Kai's brow furrowed. He regarded her coolly for a moment, then asked in a low voice, "Since Yang Yan can give orders to you, can it be said that she is not gravely harmed? Then why did the disciples below say she returned unconscious and was carried back by you?"

"That's correct—the Lord was indeed in an unconscious state, but there is no grave harm; it's just that......" Ye Xijun began.

"Just what?"

Ye Xijun fell silent, a look of trouble on her face.

Reading her expression, Yang Kai's heart stirred; he narrowed his eyes and said, "I'll ask plainly—please, Great Elder, speak frankly. Don't hide anything."

"Sect Master, please ask." Ye Xijun raised her head and smoothed a lock of hair behind her ear.

"Is the person inside the bamboo tower the Yang Yan I know, or... your Lord?"

"Both," Ye Xijun managed a bitter smile.

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded lightly, a look of sudden comprehension on his face. "So that's how it is—so that's what awakening the Great Emperor entails. I understand."

Previously Yang Yan had said that the day the Imperial Garden opened would be the time to rouse the Great Emperor. At the time Yang Kai had been puzzled and suspicious, but he had not probed further, or rather he had subconsciously feared asking for details lest the answer not be what he wanted to hear.

He had already harbored suspicions in his subconscious.

And today, that suspicion had been confirmed.

The Great Emperor, as the primary body, had awakened; Yang Yan, as a Soul Incarnation, could not persist independently—the two had fused into one, which explained Ye Xijun's reply.

"Sect Master, you are an intelligent man; you should understand the current situation," Ye Xijun said calmly, looking at him.

"I understand. I only want to know what will become of Yang Yan."

"She is the Lord; the Lord and she are one, so nothing will befall her."

Yang Kai nodded lightly; things had not deteriorated beyond what he could accept—this outcome, while not ideal, was far from the worst.

With that in mind, Yang Kai closed his eyes and released his Divine Sense toward the bamboo tower to see Yang Yan's condition; Ye Xijun opened her mouth but ultimately did not stop him.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense easily pierced the bamboo tower's concealment and soon found Yang Yan in a room on the third floor; she lay motionless on a bamboo bed, as if in a deep sleep.

Her appearance matched the Yang Yan he remembered, but her aura was entirely different.

As his Divine Sense swept over her, Yang Kai felt his heart pound as if he were an ant foolhardily peering at a sleeping dragon.

In an instant his soul trembled; an inexplicable sense of crisis rose from his chest.

The next moment, a pain like being torn apart shot through his mind; Yang Kai snapped his eyes open, his body instinctively recoiling, his face deathly pale.

"Sect Master, are you all right?" Ye Xijun's face blanched.

"I'm fine!" Yang Kai waved his hand, though his expression remained shaken—so this was the Imperial Might. Even in slumber it would in no way permit intrusion. He had at last experienced it firsthand.

If she were awake, what awe‑inspiring majesty would she possess?

Yang Kai's emotions swelled; his eyes shone with longing and aspiration.

After a long while his mood calmed; rubbing his temples he asked, "Did she ever say when she might awaken?"

"The Lord has slept for far too long—tens of thousands of years—so the awakening will be a long process. Only when soul and body are fully merged will she truly awaken. It might take only ten or twenty years, or it might take decades or even a hundred years; I cannot say for certain."

"That long." Yang Kai frowned slightly.

"Yes." Ye Xijun nodded. "Before departing the Lord instructed me to assist the Sect Master wholeheartedly, so if the Sect Master has any orders, speak them and I will carry them out."

"What Yang Yan ordered..." Yang Kai felt a warm glow in his chest, realizing why Ye Xijun had been so compliant—there was this additional reason behind her demeanor.

"There is nothing you need do for now—just stay here and look after Yang Yan."

“Yes, this subordinate will not fail your trust. Sect Master, take care on your journey!” Ye Xijun gave a slight bow.

She was actually sending him away.

Yang Kai's retort died on his lips; annoyed, he swept his sleeve and left.

In any case, it was now certain that Yang Yan was not in danger. Though her Soul Incarnation had already merged with the Great Emperor’s true body, her memories and emotions would not be erased—they would simply be inherited by this slumbering form.

That was enough.

Perhaps he did not yet have the standing to speak with the Great Emperor on equal terms, but one day he would rise to that height and then be able to live peacefully alongside Yang Yan as before.

Ambition kindled pleasantly in Yang Kai's heart.

He returned to the Lingxiao Sect's main headquarters a day later; everything within the sect went on as usual, and Huang Juan's arrival brightened the spirits of Wu Yi, Chang Qi, Hao An, and the others. The mischievous little Lin Yun'er won the affection of the entire sect.

The little girl's arrival brought laughter to the sect; after a short period of getting acquainted, Lin Yun'er quickly grew fond of this picturesque place—everyone treated her kindly, cared for her like family, and the little Lin Yun'er felt a long‑missed warmth of home and gradually grew bolder.

She could often be seen wearing pretty new clothes, scampering through the sect like a little wild thing, running about.

Huang Juan chased after her, out of breath.

Tianyi Palace, Yang Kai's place of cultivation.

In a side chamber Yang Kai sat cross‑legged with his eyes closed, meditating; he had maintained this state for a full half month. When he had previously used Divine Sense to peer into the bamboo tower and encountered the intangible Imperial Might, the shock had left a flaw in his mind.

This flaw was usually inconspicuous and would not trigger on its own, but against a powerful foe it would affect Yang Kai's performance.

So the first thing Yang Kai did upon returning to the sect's main headquarters was to erase that flaw!
