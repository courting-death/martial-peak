## Chapter 1344 — Ice Path

For now he put the matter of the Formation Talisman aside; Yang Kai quietly resolved that once they returned he must ask Yang Yan about it. If she truly could forge Formation Talismans, then there'd be no need for huge Formation Plates or Foundations in the future — just have her craft a few Formation Talismans to carry on their persons and a grand array could be set anywhere, anytime.

After a short while, Fei Zhi Tu and the others recovered to their normal selves; after a brief consultation they resumed their journey.

Along the way, now and then they passed flower beds where strange, qi-suffused flowers and herbs had been casually planted. Each of those exotic blooms and herbs was worth a fortune; many were long thought extinct, and at a glance they were indistinguishable from genuine treasures.

But a hard lesson sharpens the senses — having endured the torments of the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation, Fei Zhi Tu and the others no longer dared to tamper with those curiosities, lest they inadvertently trigger some formation seal.

Yang Kai, however, felt a keen interest in those strange plants. From his knowledge and judgment he suspected that among the specimens planted in those flower beds, real genuine items might indeed be hidden.

In other words, those things were not all traps; some were truly rare medicinal materials. But he was not one hundred percent certain, and their priority was to rescue Qian Tong, so even though his heart stirred he simply fell in behind Fei Zhi Tu and the others and kept moving, paying no heed to the plants.

Still, he silently memorized the route, planning that once Qian Tong was rescued he would return if opportunity allowed to thoroughly explore and sort the true from the false.

Despite their caution, the road was not without trouble — myriad defensive formation seals in this ancient ruin were woven with endless guile. Fei Zhi Tu, as an expert of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, constantly probed with his Divine Sense but still could not clearly discern the dangers.

Fortunately the party also included two Formation Masters, Cai He and Du Sisi, who played a tremendous role. Whenever the group was beset by arrays, the two would combine their efforts to dispel them while the others stood guard to block the formations' attacks.

Thus their journey, though difficult, did not result in casualties; only the old woman suffered some light injuries, while Saint King Realm cultivators Yang Kai and Lian Guang were guarded thoroughly and encountered no real danger.

Regrettably, once those arrays were dismantled there were no Formation Talismans to be found. Cai He and Du Sisi were extremely disappointed.

Three days later the group stood before a broad passageway. The corridor was immaculate and white, seeming as if laid with pure white jade, spotless, but it exuded a bone-chilling cold. Ribbons of cold were almost visible to the naked eye, gathering into shapes in midair, and along both sides of the passage stood ice spires like a mountain of blades, each cone glinting with bitter frost — enough to make one's skin crawl.

Even standing before the passage without having entered, they were affected by that piercing cold; frost formed on their brows and hair.

"This should be the Ice Path!" Fei Zhi Tu said, his face grave; it was half to himself and half informing the others.

"How did Elder Qian ever pass through such cold?" Ning Xiangchen's face paled; he thought that if he himself fell into that corridor he would be frozen into an ice statue within moments and could never make it to the end.

Qian Tong was an expert of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, but without some extraordinary treasure to counteract the cold here, even he could not have brought that Saint King-Grade artificer through.

"I heard Elder Qian obtained a Blazing Fire Pearl decades ago; he probably relied on its power," the old woman murmured, thinking aloud.

Fei Zhi Tu nodded slightly. "Indeed — that old Qian did have a Blazing Fire Pearl; otherwise he would have been forced to turn back." He then turned to Yang Kai and asked, "Can you manage it?"

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and stared at the passage, replying with a question instead of an answer: "Lord Fei, do you know how long that corridor is?"

Fei Zhi Tu shook his head. "Elder Qian's transmitted mental message made no mention of length, so I don't know how far it extends. But since Elder Qian could bring people through with the help of the Blazing Fire Pearl, it likely isn't excessively long."

"If it's not long, then that's no problem," Yang Kai said, stroking his chin as he considered.

The reason Fei Zhi Tu had brought Yang Kai along was precisely to rely on the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird's power to get through the Ice Path, and now the time had come for Yang Kai to lend his strength.

"Don't worry — I'm prepared too; I won't rely solely on your Artifact Spirit," Fei Zhi Tu reassured, and with a palm gesture a secret treasure like a small bronze bell appeared in his hand. The bell shone a deep crimson, radiating a pure, searing heat.

“Li Fire Shield!” Ning Xiangchen’s eyes lit up as he smiled and said, “I didn’t expect Brother Fei to even borrow a Secret Treasure like the Li Fire Shield. With this, passing through the Ice Path should be almost certain.”

Fei Zhi Tu laughed softly. "Although the Li Fire Shield is the Hall Master's treasure and seldom seen in conflict, if it's to rescue Elder Qian the Hall Master would not be stingy in lending it."

Hearing this, the younger members, including Yang Kai, realized that the Li Fire Shield belonged to the Yingyue Hall's Hall Master; Fei Zhi Tu had borrowed it for this operation.

Although a borrowed Li Fire Shield could not unleash its full power, assisting in a supporting role posed no problem.

Yang Kai nodded, relieved. He focused his Divine Sense, and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird surged forth from his body. At his command it suddenly unfolded into a luminous curtain and wrapped all eight of them together.

The Fire Bird had no physical body; though it often took avian form, it could shift endlessly.

At the same time Fei Zhi Tu exhaled a ball of refined qi and breathed it onto the Li Fire Shield. With a push of Saint Yuan it expanded and enveloped the group.

Beneath these two layers of protection, each person felt significantly safer.

“Ah! Don’t push me!” Du Sisi’s quiet complaint came from behind, and when Yang Kai turned his head, he saw Cai He standing there with an awkward smile plastered on his face.

The reason was simple: to maximize the combined effect of the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird and the Li Fire Shield, Yang Kai and Fei Zhi Tu had minimized the range of their protections.

As a result, the eight of them stood cramped together. Cai He, protective of the beauty at his side, stood close to Du Sisi — only to have her complain rather than appreciate it.

Cai He was good-natured and didn't take offense; he patiently tried to explain himself to Du Sisi.

"Let's go!" Yang Kai called, and he and Fei Zhi Tu strode forward side by side.

The moment they stepped into the Ice Path a chill ran through them, as if invisible blades pierced through the two layers of protection and stabbed into their flesh — the cold made every nerve ache.

If two layers of fire-based protection were still so terrifying, then without any protection at all stepping in here would bring disaster.

Everyone's faces changed. Du Sisi had no more composure to scold Cai He; her pretty face went white and she unconsciously moved closer to him, seeking safety. Cai He was overjoyed and inwardly wished the Ice Path would never end.

Yang Kai's expression also turned grave. He and the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird were linked by thought and could sense the Path's cold more keenly than anyone. Every moment spent here consumed the Fire Bird's strength; though it could be replenished, Artifact Spirits were a major boon when exploring ancient ruins, and Yang Kai did not want to waste its power.

They quickened their pace.

From their earlier vantage they had not been able to see inside the Path clearly, but now that they stood within, everyone paled at what they observed: the ice-based Spiritual Qi on either side had condensed into dense mists.

Although each of them understood that in such relentless cold, over countless years valuable things could form, none were in the mood to investigate — they only wanted to exit the Ice Path as soon as possible.

After the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea, Yang Kai frowned; he realized he had underestimated the Path's length. Looking ahead, he still could not see its end; looking back, the way they had come was indistinct, and the whole world was eerily silent save for the occasional heartbeats and breaths.

They had walked a long way when Du Sisi suddenly cried out, "Look over there!"

Everyone was startled and followed her pointing finger, and their faces instantly drained of color.

For in their sight stood one human-shaped ice statue after another, all uncannily lifelike, frozen upright some less than thirty zhang from the Ice Path.

The statues included men and women, old and young; their clothing differed, and their expressions varied — some wore astonishment, some terror, some serene indifference — as if they had been unaware of what happened in their dying moments.

Those ice sculptures were all formed from living people who had been frozen!

"It seems Elder Qian wasn't the only one to discover this ancient ruin," Fei Zhi Tu sighed softly.

These statues were clearly martial artists who had come to explore this place earlier. For some unknown reason they had all been frozen in place; there were no wounds on their bodies and no traces of battle — their deaths were extremely strange and inexplicable.

"This is…" Fear flashed in Ning Xiangchen's old eyes as he stared at one statue for a long time.

"Ning brother, you recognize him too?" the old woman glanced at him.

"If you recognize him as well, then there can be no mistake — it truly is him. I only saw him once in my youth, and I never expected he would fall here," Ning Xiangchen said with a bitter smile.

“There are people here whom the two Seniors know?” Cai He asked in surprise.

"Yes. Two hundred years ago there was a supreme genius famed on Dark Star. Though not from Star Emperor Mountain, rumors then said he was the most likely to break Dark Star's shackles and ascend to the Void King Realm; sadly, he has been unheard of for a century," Ning Xiangchen explained calmly.

"Such a genius has perished too," Cai He said with regret.

"Look closely at their garments!" Fei Zhi Tu said, as if he had discovered something.
