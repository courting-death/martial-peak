## Chapter 1746 — Claiming Territory

“No!” Luo Lan shook her head solemnly, then shot Gu Jianxin a glare. “What? Is Auntie Lan very long-lived? Am I old?”

“Uh…” Gu Jianxin awkwardly scratched his head, then quickly adopted a serious tone. “Besides, from what I observed, the method he used to ambush Li Minghai and to kill him seemed to make use of Spatial Force!”

Luo Lan’s attention was indeed diverted; she let out a soft exclamation. “Spatial Force? He can wield that power against an enemy?”

“Not only that!” Gu Jianxin recalled the scene, his expression shifting as his voice grew low. “His mastery of Spatial Force seems to have reached an unprecedented realm—he could condense spatial power into a blade and use it to devour and exile Li Minghai’s body!”

Luo Lan could not help but raise a hand to cover her small mouth.

“In any case, this is someone I wish only to befriend, not to offend. So I’ll have to trouble Aunt Lan to keep an eye on him from now on.”

“Rest assured, since he requested a territory of one hundred thousand li, there will naturally be opportunities to contact him later.” Luo Lan’s beautiful eyes shone with an odd light; she seemed greatly interested in Yang Kai. She added, “Mm, recount to Auntie in detail how you fought Li Minghai; this matter is rather interesting.”

…

The Sword Alliance moved quickly — or rather, Luo Lan was very efficient.

Yang Kai remained in Qingmu Palace for a day. On the second day a servant came to report that Luo Lan had asked for him; she had important matters to discuss.

This immediately brought Yang Kai’s mind back to the matter of the one hundred thousand li territory, so he did not delay and followed the servant out of his chamber.

After the servant led him down a few twists and turns through Qingmu Palace, Yang Kai soon saw Gu Jianxin in plain clothes standing in a corridor, waving at him with a grin.

Sword Servant Lingyue stood to his left, and Sword Servant Anxing to his right.

“Brother Gu!” Yang Kai stepped forward and cupped his fist.

“Brother Yang, are you settling in comfortably?” Gu Jianxin asked warmly.

“Extremely comfortable!” Yang Kai replied.

“Good, good; I was worried the hospitality might be lacking. If Brother Yang is comfortable, then I can rest easy.”

“Mm, Elder Luo asked me to come because—”

“Just as you suspected.” Gu Jianxin gave Yang Kai a knowing look, hooked an arm around his shoulder and said cheerfully, “Come with me.”

They walked along the corridor and soon reached its end. Ahead a luminous curtain blocked the view like a screen of water; countless rice-grain-sized talismans and patterns swam and wove across its surface, appearing obscure and complex.

Gu Jianxin treated it as nothing, strode straight forward, and instructed the two Sword Servants, “Remain here. Anyone who dares to approach is to be killed without mercy.”

“Yes!” Lingyue and Anxing answered in unison and halted.

Gu Jianxin then led Yang Kai straight through the light curtain.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai felt as though he had arrived in another world.

It was silent here; apart from a huge spherical object, there was nothing else.

The sphere was about ten zhang in diameter, its surface interwoven with irregular patterns of earthy yellow, watery blue, and verdant green. These colors intertwined and gleamed together, forming the intricate surface of the sphere.

When Yang Kai arrived, the sphere was rotating clockwise at a subtle pace.

Luo Lan stood to one side, smiling as she greeted, “Young Brother!”

“Elder Luo!” Yang Kai hurriedly returned the salute, but his attention was quickly drawn to the sphere before him.

Neither Luo Lan nor Gu Jianxin seemed intent on explaining; instead they watched Yang Kai’s changing expressions with obvious pleasure.

After a moment Yang Kai’s face brightened with sudden comprehension; he turned to Luo Lan and Gu Jianxin in surprise. “Is this thing the Qingmu Star reduced by countless times?”

“Sharp-eyed, Young Brother!” Luo Lan smiled. “It is indeed the Qingmu Star miniaturized a thousandfold. The Sword Alliance spent a full hundred years, mobilized countless warriors, surveyed the Qingmu Star’s geography, measured the dimensions of its regions, and only with great effort produced this.”

“So the map Elder Luo mentioned yesterday was this?” Yang Kai mused.

“Exactly!” Gu Jianxin nodded with a smile. “The map Aunt Lan spoke of is this very thing, which is why we waited until today for Brother Yang to see it.”

“With this, things are much more convenient.” Yang Kai clicked his tongue in admiration and circled the sphere; he quickly discerned what each color represented.

The earth-yellow obviously represented land; the water-blue the seas; the verdant green, the jungles.

There were a few other colors, representing rare regions like swamps or deserts.

The Sword Alliance’s method was impressive — only a great power could spare a century to accomplish it.

Looking more closely, many city-shaped markers large and small dotted the sphere, indicating where martial folk had settled on the Qingmu Star.

With this, Luo Lan’s administration of the Qingmu Star would be much easier.

While Yang Kai observed, Luo Lan explained proactively: as Yang Kai suspected, the different colors corresponded to different terrains, and by the depth of the color one could judge the richness of the area’s Spiritual Qi.

The paler the color, the thinner the Spiritual Qi; the deeper, the more concentrated.

After briefly explaining, Luo Lan said, “Since Young Brother wants a territory of one hundred thousand li — not too large or small — I have selected several locations for you to choose from. Of course these are merely my humble suggestions; if you are unsatisfied you may select anywhere on the Qingmu Star yourself.”

Yang Kai was slightly moved and cupped his fist. “Thank you for your kindness, Elder. I dare not refuse; please point out a few.”

“No need to be so formal, Young Brother.” Luo Lan smiled and flicked her hand; the sphere sped up and then froze. She pointed to a spot. “This is my first suggestion: surrounded by mountains on all sides, facing the Ning River, resources are relatively abundant, Spiritual Qi fairly concentrated; there is also a nearby Ning City that could belong to you.”

“A whole city? Is that all right?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

He only wanted a not-utterly-wilderness tract; he hadn’t expected them to gift him an entire city.

“It’s nothing special, just a single city.” Gu Jianxin chuckled.

“Indeed, on the Qingmu Star there are thousands — if not eight thousand — such cities; it is a boon that Young Brother would accept it.” Luo Lan laughed as well. Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling Luo Lan’s attitude toward him had warmed somewhat since yesterday; she seemed much more cordial.

“If Young Brother isn’t fond of that spot, look at this.” Luo Lan waved her hand and the sphere turned again. When it froze, she pointed to another location. “This is also good — I’ve been there; it’s picturesque, populated by outstanding people, and produces many beauties…”

Seeing Yang Kai’s indifferent expression, Luo Lan promptly moved on to the next suggestion.

After seven or eight locations were introduced in succession, Yang Kai still showed no sign of enthusiasm.

Strictly speaking, all the locations Luo Lan had selected for Yang Kai were excellent: Spiritual Qi was rich and the choices considered many factors — thoroughly thought out.

Yet Yang Kai seemed unsatisfied with every single one, which puzzled Luo Lan; she could not tell what kind of place Yang Kai truly wanted.

“Elder Luo, is there a suitable place on the sea?” Yang Kai interrupted as she prepared to introduce a new spot.

“At sea?” Luo Lan arched a dainty brow and smiled. “So Young Brother wishes to live by the sea! Then how about this spot?”

…

Half an hour later Yang Kai walked out from that strange place looking thoroughly satisfied.

After some investigation and comparison, he ultimately chose a place called Twin Shark Island.

The place could be considered two sea isles or a single island because they connected; from above the two islands resembled two sharks swimming side by side across the sea, uncannily lifelike.

Hence the name Twin Shark Island!

Its area matched Yang Kai’s requirement precisely — not more, not less — about one hundred thousand li.

Fifty thousand li from Twin Shark Island stood a coastal city five hundred thousand li away.

The island was relatively remote on the Qingmu Star. Luo Lan and Gu Jianxin did not understand why he chose such a place. Compared to the spots they had suggested before, Twin Shark Island had little advantage beyond decent Spiritual Qi.

Yang Kai preferred the distant over the nearby, the secondary over the superior — by all appearances a losing bargain.

But since Yang Kai agreed to it, they had no reason to object.

From that moment on Twin Shark Island became Yang Kai’s territory. As long as the faction Gu Jianxin belonged to still controlled the Sword Alliance, no one could take Twin Shark Island from him.

That was Gu Jianxin’s promise to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not care much; the land was in his hands now. If anyone later dared to seize it, they would first have to judge whether they were strong enough.

The next day Yang Kai took his leave of Luo Lan and Gu Jianxin and prepared to depart for Twin Shark Island.

Outside Qingmu Palace Gu Jianxin looked a little guilty. “Brother Yang, I cannot personally escort you there. I have important affairs on the Qingmu Star and am spread too thin.”

“Brother Gu needn’t be polite. I know how to get to Twin Shark Island, and with the writ and token Elder Luo gave me, handling matters there will be convenient. You needn’t trouble yourself.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Gu Jianxin said, “That’s good.” He smiled mysteriously. “However, Brother Yang, a few people wish to accompany you to Twin Shark Island; I hope you won’t refuse.”
