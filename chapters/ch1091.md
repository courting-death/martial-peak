## Chapter 1091 — The Altar

Yang Kai followed Ji Ping and the others, traveling in this place for many days; though they encountered some hardships, they met no great danger, for Ji Ping held an ancestral codex that told him which way was safe.

Diji was different. He came here intent on finding treasures, had run into all manner of perils, fought his way through, and his companions lay dead one after another. Only he remained, barely clinging to life and in a pitiable state.

He tried to creep up behind Ji Ping to finish him off, but Yang Kai had seen everything clearly.

Diji glared savagely at Yang Kai, furious that his scheme had been spoiled.

“How did you find this place?” Ji Ping asked coldly.

Diji snorted heavily. “I’m not deaf — I heard the calls coming from this direction, didn’t you?”

As he spoke, his face grew ecstatic. Looking at Ji Ping he said, “What you said just now was true? This Body Tempering Divine Pool can really improve one’s constitution? Your ancestor really cultivated to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm?”

“So what if he did?” Ji Ping did not deny it. It was obvious Diji had been here some time and had heard him and Guiche and the others talking; there was no point in denying it now.

“Good, good!” Diji rejoiced. “It wasn’t for nothing I led people to search for you for half a year. Before I didn’t know what you were doing, only that there was something to be gained. Now I know. Ji Ping, you’re no match for me. If you want to live, leave obediently — otherwise don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

Panic flashed across Ji Ping’s face. He had only reached the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, while Diji’s cultivation was a bit higher, and he knew he couldn’t beat him. But the panic quickly vanished and Ji Ping smiled: “You’re not in great shape right now either, are you? If you could easily kill me, you wouldn’t be saying this trash. Still, if the two of us were to fight right now, who would be left alive in the end?”

“You saw through me?” Diji laughed carefreely, with no shame. He nodded, “Since you saw it, I won’t play games. There’s only the two of us left here — neither of us can deal with the other. Want to discuss terms?”

“What do you want?” Ji Ping glared at him angrily.

He had known Diji had brought people in here too, but never expected to meet him at the final moment. He wanted to kill Diji on the spot, but feared making a rash move.

“No need to create trouble for each other. The pool is large; the two of us can both enter and temper our bodies, share the benefits, and keep the peace.” Diji suggested with a solemn face.

“Fine, that’s what I was thinking too. We’ve come this far — I don’t want to lose everything now. I can share some benefits with you.” Ji Ping nodded readily.

“Then it’s settled?” Diji chuckled.

Ji Ping nodded again.

The two of them stared at one another across a distance of more than ten zhang, both wearing satisfied expressions as if a real agreement had been reached.

Suddenly, a dark-golden breastplate appeared on Ji Ping. He swung his fists and fierce force burst from his knuckles, coalescing into substance. Like gleaming blades they howled toward Diji.

Diji's hand shimmered with silver light as a silver spear leisurely materialized. The patterns along the spear seemed to come alive, exuding dense, water-attribute energy. Furious waves formed, surging up like a tsunami to meet Ji Ping's attack.

The battle was about to erupt. The two who had just made an agreement struck to kill each other at the same time.

Hidden in the pool’s water, Yang Kai sneered. He knew these two could not coexist peacefully — Ji Ping would not give Diji time to recover. Once Diji recovered, he would be no match, so Ji Ping had to strike now. Whether he had confidence or not, he must gamble everything.

Although Ji Ping’s cultivation was slightly inferior, Diji was in poor condition; until the end no one could be sure which side would win.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai grew bored. He relaxed and stopped resisting the pulling force beneath his feet, letting it draw him into the pool.

He wanted to see what mysteries hid within the pool’s depths.

The dark-red water churned like a boiling cauldron, and the profound mysteries within constantly tempered Yang Kai’s blood.

Squinting, he sank down until he felt the pool floor. Only then did the pulling force vanish.

Below was pitch-black; nothing could be seen. The dark-red water blocked all light.

Yang Kai had to take out a luminous magic stone to hold in his hand, then released his Divine Sense to probe around. Not far off he sensed a strange fluctuation of power — he knew this must be where the altar Ji Ping had mentioned was located.

He did not rush to the altar, but began searching the pool’s bottom in all directions.

Before long, Yang Kai discovered a Spatial Ring lying quietly on the pool floor. Probing it with Divine Sense, he grinned broadly.

Inside the Spatial Ring were the thunder-attributed avian wood sprouted from the corpse of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast Thunder Luan, the carapace of a Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion, countless medicinal herbs, and Inner Cores from Seventh- and Eighth-Tier demonic beasts.

It was Guiche’s Spatial Ring!

Satisfied, Yang Kai slipped the ring into his bosom and stowed it carefully.

Spatial Rings are special because each contains its own independent space, so they conflict with the Demon God's Secret Codex — Spatial Rings cannot be placed inside that Codex, though a Spatial Pouch can. Yang Kai did not know why.

Guiche’s ring held the most valuable items. Finding it put Yang Kai’s heart at ease and he continued searching nearby.

The Body-Tempering Divine Pool was not large — about thirty zhang across, but its depth exceeded a hundred zhang.

Searching such a place for a few rings was not difficult. Soon Yang Kai also found the Spatial Rings belonging to Gan Ji and Luo Yao and tucked them away.

From above the pool came violent surges of energy, interspersed with Ji Ping and Diji’s angry shouts. The two were still locked in fierce combat; after watching for a while and seeing they could not disengage anytime soon, Yang Kai leisurely swam toward the altar.

In moments he arrived beside the altar. Gazing at it, he saw an altar-like structure standing quietly, covered with intricately drawn formations. Around it were things like Saint Crystals, flashing brilliant crystal light, with energy fluctuations that were astonishing.

Yang Kai looked closely and realized these ‘Saint Crystals’ could no longer be called ordinary Saint Crystals.

They outshone even the best Upper-Level Saint Crystals; the energy contained within was beyond what a Saint Crystal could normally match.

There seemed to be an energy composite higher than Saint Crystals? Yang Kai was slightly moved; he did not know how to name these crystal stones.

The formation lines on the altar were like the lines of a palm, dense and crisscrossing. Extremely complex.

This place was clearly man-made, laid out by someone — but whose handiwork it was, Yang Kai could not tell.

Countless points of light, like a sky of fireflies, flowed across the altar in a marvelous display that stirred the heart. The lights gathered into streams of energy that seemed to run without end.

The altar was strewn with countless heaven-and-earth treasures whose names Yang Kai could not call; each was peerless and exceedingly rare.

It was the altar’s influence that could trigger the effects of those treasures, allowing Yang Kai’s blood to be tempered and to breed the purest Demon God Golden Blood!

Ecstatic, he sat cross-legged on the altar, wanting to submit to a more violent tempering.

No sooner had he settled than the whole altar trembled, and the Body-Tempering Divine Pool seemed to respond. The water abruptly dropped and surged fiercely toward the altar.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. He had not expected this. He struggled to leave the altar, but the returning current bound him tightly in place; he could not even move a finger.

Probing with Divine Sense, he clearly perceived the pool’s water level plummeting — not because the water was disappearing, but because it was being drawn and compressed by the altar.

This anomaly alarmed Ji Ping and Diji, who were fighting to the death. Both stopped and stared at the pool in shock.

When they saw the pool as if a great hole had opened and the water rapidly dwindled, Ji Ping cried out madly and rushed over heedless of everything.

He had sacrificed and schemed for so long to temper his body. His wish was about to be realized; though Diji obstructed him, he would not yield. If the pool was gone, he would never achieve his goal.

He abandoned Diji and frantically chased the falling water, but could never touch it.

Diji stood dumbfounded, staring blankly.

In less than ten breaths, the pool that had been over a hundred zhang deep was completely drained; all its water compressed into a small mass and condensed into a single one-zhang, blood-red, cocoon-like crystal.

Just as Ji Ping arrived, he saw Yang Kai trapped within that cocoon crystal, looking like a corpse, and the altar that should have been present could not be found.

Ji Ping stood motionless, eyes vacant as if his soul had fled.

After a moment, Ji Ping suddenly screamed and launched a frenzied attack on the blood-red crystal. He released the full power of his Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, making even Diji watch in alarm from afar.

Diji felt he could not withstand such a suicidal burst.

But strangely, the blood-red crystal was as solid as metal. Ji Ping’s assault could not damage it or even leave a mark.

The earth suddenly trembled and huge ravines appeared. Demonic beasts living here sensed the impending danger and rushed out from their lairs, scattering to flee.

Diji’s expression changed and he did not hesitate — he fled quickly.

Ji Ping ceased his assault, released his Divine Sense, sensed something amiss, regained a measure of reason, struck the crystal hard once more, and prepared to leave.

But it was too late. An endless suction force issued from the crystal. In this strange world, all living things — even the life force in grass and trees — were drawn into points of light and gathered toward the blood-red crystal.

Ji Ping watched in horror as his skin wrinkled, flesh withered, and life drained away. It was as if a thousand years of time washed over him; he grew decrepit and collapsed, becoming a pile of dried bones that the wind turned to dust.
