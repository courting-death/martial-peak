## Chapter 1034 — I Will Tell You If I Need It

The girls in the bathing pool were all untouched maidens; though they had undergone some training beforehand, this was their first time in action, so their movements were naturally clumsy and awkward. For Yang Kai, however, it was just right. He leaned against the pool wall, eyes closed, conserving his spirit, letting those few girls scrub every inch of his body.

The maid who had led Yang Kai in carried a flower basket. With slender jade-like fingers she pinched off petals and scattered them into the water, then parted her crimson lips and said, “These are Spirit-Nourishing Flowers; their fragrance can nourish the soul. Used in a bath they strengthen the body… and, um, can also enhance a man’s ability in that regard!”

As she spoke, her cheeks flushed crimson, as if they might bleed.

Yang Kai casually gave her a tug, and with her shriek he pulled her into the pool. The water soaked her garments; she stood upright and wiped the splash from her cheek, looking at Yang Kai with some embarrassment.

Her wet clothes clung to her body; a pair of jade peaks rose high and proud, far better endowed than the other girls. Her whole being exuded a mature, voluptuous charm.

“You’re not still a virgin, are you?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

The maid’s face grew even redder, and bashfully she nodded: “I am no longer that, so I have no qualification to serve a noble guest like you.”

“Whether you’re qualified is for me to decide.”

Her beautiful eyes brightened; she deliberately shed her garments and then plunged headfirst into the water, disappearing from sight.

Soon Yang Kai’s expression turned both… peculiar and strange.

……

In the main hall wind instruments sounded; one after another, beautiful girls sang and danced below, their movements exquisitely graceful.

On the long table lay rare delicacies and fine wines; Shen Tu and Yang Kai sat shoulder to shoulder, drinking and making merry.

More and more mountain delicacies and seafood were brought up by the palace’s maidservants.

Yang Kai could hardly recognize what those things were, yet each gave off an uncommon energy fluctuation. Eating them seemed not only to fill the belly but also to boost a martial artist’s power and cultivation.

Yang Kai ate and drank without restraint, unembarrassed, his manner natural.

The middle-aged martial artist called Jia Long stood not far off, watching Shen Tu treat Yang Kai in such style, watching them drink and laugh together. He suddenly realized that this youth, who had only reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, held a very high place in Shen Tu’s heart.

He couldn’t help but wonder what outstanding qualities this young man possessed to receive such solemn treatment from Young Master Shen Tu.

The maid who had tended Yang Kai earlier came up, leaned close to Shen Tu and whispered a few words in his ear, then, cheeks flushed, glanced at Yang Kai and gracefully withdrew.

Shen Tu burst into laughter, a strange expression on his face. He didn’t expose what had just happened, but drew close to Yang Kai and said, “Brother Yang, where will you go from here? Do you have any plans?”

“Not for now.” Yang Kai shook his head.

Shen Tu knew he had only just arrived in this Star Domain and likely had no destination in mind, nor did he know where to go.

He began to think of recruiting Yang Kai.

Shuiyue Star had been Yang Kai’s first stop in this Star Domain, and he was on good terms with Yang Kai. Shen Tu believed that with proper persuasion, Yang Kai would remain in the Hengluo Commerce Guild and in his palace.

After a series of events, Shen Tu had discovered Yang Kai’s potential and abilities; he knew that such a person, given enough time, could grow to an extremely terrifying degree.

“No rush to decide. For now you can stay with me. When you’ve made up your mind, tell me.” Shen Tu didn’t explicitly say he wanted him to stay—such matters had to be Yang Kai’s own choice. He couldn’t treat Yang Kai like one of his subordinates.

“Alright, I’ll tell you when I decide.” Yang Kai smiled faintly and continued to watch the group of girls below, admiring their elegant figures.

Two hours later, sated with food and drink, Shen Tu stumbled back to his room to rest, and Yang Kai was led by a maid to a side chamber.

The room was quite large and located very high up—at the top of a three-hundred-zhang building. He came to the window and, through the transparent glass, looked down at the myriad lights below and the surging crowds, suddenly feeling a twinge of loneliness.

Years earlier when he had come from Zhongdu to the Tongxuan Continent, he had not felt like this.

Zhongdu and the Tongxuan Continent lay on the same star.

Now he was somewhere in the boundless Star Domain. He had no idea where the Tongxuan Continent lay—what direction or how far.

He felt utterly alone.

His heart overflowed with longing and concern.

Suddenly his expression shifted; eyes bright with excitement, he went to the bed and sat cross-legged.

He sank his spirit into his Sea of Consciousness and manifested a Spirit Body.

Gazing up at the vast Star Chart hanging above his Sea of Consciousness, he guided his Divine Sense to traverse it, trying to locate the Tongxuan Continent.

The Star Chart was extraordinarily intricate, mapping the Star Domain’s countless stars, and it was not static. Driven by some unknown power it constantly underwent subtle changes.

Those changes reflected the real shifts occurring within the Star Domain.

It projected the conditions throughout the Star Domain.

If the chart were detailed enough, it should show the existence of the Tongxuan Continent, Yang Kai thought.

His Divine Sense leapt from star to star; following the sensations, Yang Kai tried to calculate the Tongxuan Continent’s direction.

An hour later, fatigue showed on his face; the power in his Sea of Consciousness had been nearly exhausted.

He had to stop and replenish his strength.

Over and over he repeated the process, and although he failed to locate the Tongxuan Continent, he gained some understanding of the star arrangements within the Star Domain and learned of some dangerous regions.

He realized he had underestimated the Star Chart’s profundity. He could not probe very far; the chart’s scope seemed boundless. He spent the whole night and only explored a tiny portion of the Star Domain—an insignificant area compared to the whole.

He acknowledged his own lack of strength.

If he were stronger, his probing would be faster and easier.

At dawn, Yang Kai’s spirit sagging, he gave up on studying the Star Chart and decided to wait until he grew stronger before trying to locate the Tongxuan Continent precisely.

A knock came at the door; Yang Kai answered casually.

The familiar maid stood there and bowed with a gentle smile. “Young Master Yang, Young Master Shen Tu told me to inform you that he was summoned by the Chairman. It may take some days before he returns. He asked you to stay here in peace and wait for him.”

“Understood.” Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

The maid did not hurry away. Her red lips trembled and, shyly expectant, she inquired, “Young Master Yang, is there any other need?”

Her words carried implication.

“If I need anything I’ll tell you.” Yang Kai smiled at her.

The maid’s face flushed slightly as she gave a gentle nod, then quietly closed the door behind her, offered a brief apology, and took her leave.

After she left, Yang Kai sat on the bed frowning.

With Shen Tu gone, he suddenly didn’t know what to do; that sense of aimlessness displeased him.

He tossed a pill into his mouth to recover and pondered.

In a moment of realization he remembered the urgent matter—he needed to get a new Star Shuttle!

His Star Shuttle had been obtained long ago with Li Rong, the leader of the Ancient Demon Clan, in the starry sky. On the Tongxuan Continent it had absolute advantages, but here it was outdated. Even the Star Shuttle that Bi Ya used was better than his.

Besides that, he needed to buy some precious ores!

Ghost Ancestor had said that the two Jet-Black Spheres kept in his Demon God’s Secret Codex needed careful nurturing; one day they would bring him surprises!

To nurture those Jet-Black Spheres required the essences of ore!

What troubled Yang Kai was that when Ghost Ancestor left, he forgot to ask what those Jet-Black Spheres actually were.

At the end their relationship had already eased; if he had asked, Ghost Ancestor would likely have explained. But at that time he had been stunned by the Star Emperor Token he’d seized and completely forgot about the matter.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai rose and strode out.

He descended to the lowest level and was about to leave Shen Tu’s palace when the middle-aged martial artist Jia Long suddenly materialized like a phantom and asked with a smile, “Young Brother, are you going out?”

“Yes, I want to buy some things.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Buy things?” Jia Long grinned. “What do you want to buy? If it’s convenient, can you tell me?”

“I want a better Star Shuttle and some ores.”

“Star Shuttles and ores?” Jia Long didn’t ask what Yang Kai needed the ores for but said, “You’re new here and unfamiliar with the place. Wait a moment; I’ll send someone to accompany you.”

Yang Kai’s expression brightened. “I’d appreciate that.”

His suggestion fit perfectly with Yang Kai’s wishes.

“Don’t be polite. Before he left, Young Master Shen Tu ordered that we accommodate all your requests. I dare not neglect a noble guest like you.” As he spoke he took out a compass-like secret treasure and poured his Divine Sense into it.

After a moment he retracted the compass and smiled at Yang Kai. “Please wait; someone will come shortly.”

Yang Kai and he waited quietly.

Soon a man came running from afar and stopped before Yang Kai and Jia Long, raising his brows. “Got business?”

He was burly, wild in temperament, exuding a terrifying aura like a ferocious beast, with dense hair at his cheeks, making him resemble a mad lion.

A yao! Yang Kai realized, deducing the man’s race from the energy fluctuations emanating from him.
