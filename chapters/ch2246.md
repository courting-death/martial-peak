## Chapter 2246 — A Heaven-Shattering Strike

For a moment, Yang Kai was also somewhat indecisive, unsure whether to take the opportunity to join Qingyang Shrine and enjoy the shelter of a great tree, or to continue living freely on his own.

“Go back and think it over for a few days. Give me your answer once you’ve made up your mind.” Gao Xueting seemed to notice his hesitation and stopped pressing him, stepping back.

Yang Kai immediately breathed a sigh of relief and said, “Many thanks, Elder Gao. About the matter of the Formless Profound Grass…”

“The price remains the same, just put it on your tab for now. I’ve already had someone deliver a thousand stalks to you,” Gao Xueting replied calmly. “Once you become a disciple of the Shrine, then your debt will be settled.”

“Alright… I suppose.” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. He thought to himself that Qingyang Shrine really did value him, even trying to tie him down with this kind of method.

After that, there was a long stretch of silence.

At a certain moment, Gao Xueting finally opened her beautiful eyes again and said, “You may go. The one delivering the Formless Profound Grass is waiting outside. Speak to him yourself.”

“Thank you, Elder Gao!” After expressing his gratitude, Yang Kai turned and left.

Outside the cave, Yang Kai indeed saw a middle-aged man waiting for him.

The man appeared around forty, but his cultivation was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. In other places such strength would be impressive—for example, in Fenglin City even the patriarchs of major families were only at this level.

But within Qingyang Shrine, it was rather unimpressive, clearly due to a lack of talent.

On this trip out of Fenglin City, Yang Kai had encountered many rising stars and outstanding youths, broadening his horizons.

As soon as the middle-aged man saw Yang Kai emerge from Gao Xueting’s cave, he hurriedly put on a broad smile and cupped his fists from afar. “By order of Elder Chen, I have brought you a thousand stalks of Formless Profound Grass. May I ask if you are Brother Yang Kai?”

“I am,” Yang Kai nodded.

The man’s eyes lit up and he praised repeatedly, “I’ve long heard of Brother Yang’s great name. Meeting you today, your reputation is truly well-deserved.”

“Oh? Am I that famous in Qingyang Shrine?” Yang Kai rubbed his nose.

The middle-aged man laughed, “Brother Yang, you must have been in seclusion cultivating these days and haven’t heard the news. Your name is not only widely spread within Qingyang Shrine, but I fear it’s already known throughout the entire Southern Territory.”

“Is that so?” Yang Kai’s expression suddenly darkened, and he felt a vague sense of unease deep inside.

The other man, however, seemed completely oblivious to Yang Kai’s change in expression and continued to flatter him enthusiastically, “Brother Yang, your exploits in Four Seasons Land—refining the Supreme Mystic Pill and shaking Wuchang of Tianwu Sacred Land—have already caused a great stir across the world. Brother Yang, you’re truly a renowned figure now…”

As he spoke, he finally noticed Yang Kai’s unpleasant expression and suddenly realized the problem. He gave an awkward smile, stopped flattering, and coughed, “Brother Yang, here is the Formless Profound Grass Elder Chen asked me to deliver. Would you like to check it?”

“No need.” Yang Kai reached out to take the Spatial Ring handed over, cupped his fists in thanks, and turned to leave.

Although he had expected that after the events in Four Seasons Land, some of his secrets would be hard to hide, he hadn’t thought the news would spread so quickly and so widely.

If that was the case, he’d have to seriously consider Gao Xueting’s proposal to join Qingyang Shrine.

With the protection of being a Qingyang Shrine disciple, he’d surely avoid a lot of trouble in the future. Otherwise, traveling the Star Realm, he might become a target for others.

The martial artists in Four Seasons Land surely knew the Supreme Mystic Pill was gone, but since the pill was so coveted, there might be some who refused to believe it and would come looking for Yang Kai to demand it…

The more he thought about it, the more irritated he became. Only after returning to his cave on the mountainside of Purple Bamboo Peak did his mood gradually settle.

But there was no point in letting such worries trouble him now. If things really did come to that, it would only be others making trouble for themselves—it had nothing to do with him.

Besides, he wasn’t easy to deal with. Although his physical cultivation hadn’t improved after training in the Divine Roaming Mirror world, his Divine Sense had advanced greatly. Ordinary martial artists would find it hard to handle him now.

Unless someone from the Emperor Realm made a move.

But even if it were a First Stage Emperor, if he couldn’t win, could he not at least escape?

At this thought, his mind suddenly cleared, and a surge of pride welled up within him. His whole being brimmed with an indescribable confidence, and he felt inexplicably at ease.

Sitting cross-legged, he took out the Slave-Insect Bracelet and stored the thousand stalks of Formless Profound Grass inside, placing them in the wine jar where the Soul-Devouring Worms were kept.

According to the Strange Insects Manual, Formless Profound Grass was the best medicine to promote the evolution of Soul-Devouring Worms. Its medicinal aura greatly stimulated the worms, and the effects of this spiritual herb could also help their growth.

In an instant, a wild clamor erupted from within the wine jar, as if the clash of golden spears and armored horses was echoing out—a cacophony of battle that seemed to shake the very air.

Yang Kai listened for a while, then paid it no more mind.

He could no longer interfere in the evolution of the Soul-Devouring Worms. Whatever the final result would be, only time would tell.

Retracting his Divine Sense, he took out another item and examined it carefully in his hand.

It was none other than the Insect Emperor’s other Imperial Treasure—the Soul-Severing Blade!

Before entering the Divine Roaming Mirror world, he’d never imagined that the Soul-Severing Blade was actually a Divine Soul Imperial Treasure. If he hadn’t brought it into the Divine Roaming Mirror, Yang Kai might not have discovered this for a long time.

If it were just an ordinary Imperial Treasure, Yang Kai wouldn’t have bothered to refine it.

He already had many means to deal with enemies. Not to mention the various space divine abilities he’d comprehended, just the Imperial Treasures in his hands included the Extinction Thunder Bead and the Myriad Sword. Of course, the Myriad Sword would have to be returned to the Qin Family once he got back to Fenglin City.

But greed always leads to trouble. Yang Kai hadn’t refined the Soul-Severing Blade before, partly because of this concern and partly due to lack of strength.

But if it was a Divine Soul Imperial Treasure, that was different. Yang Kai had every reason to refine it.

So he’d long decided that after handling the Soul-Devouring Worms, he would begin refining the Soul-Severing Blade.

He’d thought that refining such an Imperial Treasure would take a lot of effort and time. After all, even refining the Slave-Insect Bracelet had cost him a full month, let alone the Soul-Severing Blade, which was meant for killing.

But in fact, refining the Soul-Severing Blade was even easier than refining the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

In less than half a month, Yang Kai had already broken the restrictions on the Soul-Severing Blade, erased the Insect Emperor’s imprint, and left his own Divine Soul mark inside…

After thinking it over, he figured there were two reasons for this. One was that his Divine Sense was strong enough to shorten the refining time. The other was that, in the Divine Roaming Mirror world, the blade had merged with his Spirit Body and fought alongside him, strengthening their connection. That’s why it only took half a month to succeed.

However... just like with all Secret Treasures, successfully refining it did not mean he could immediately draw out its full power. To truly unleash all the might contained within a Secret Treasure was always a gradual process, one that required time and careful nurturing.

Yang Kai placed the Soul-Severing Blade in his Sea of Consciousness. His Spirit Body appeared, and he spared no effort, using a secret technique to refine it.

This secret technique was something he’d learned from Tian Yan.

In the last two days in the Divine Roaming world, Yang Kai had sought advice from Senior Tian Yan on many matters.

After all, the man was a Great Emperor. Though he had no physical body, at that level, giving Yang Kai some pointers was a simple matter.

When it came to cultivating the Divine Soul, secret techniques, and experience, Tian Yan was generous, imparting much knowledge that would benefit Yang Kai for life.

But as for secret arts, Yang Kai only learned one from Tian Yan.

Tian Yan had said that with secret arts, quality mattered more than quantity. If used well, even one could make you invincible. If not, learning many was useless. The three thousand Daos all lead to the same end; martial skills and cultivation methods are the same.

So he only taught Yang Kai a single secret art.

This secret art was called the Heaven-Shattering Strike!

Ordinarily, this secret technique was used to slowly refine and nurture a weapon through special methods. When the Heaven-Shattering Strike was unleashed, the very first blow would erupt with all the power accumulated during that long period of tempering, often deciding life and death in an instant and settling the outcome with a single strike.

Tian Yan didn’t have a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, so he used this secret art to nurture a weapon condensed from his own Divine Soul power.

Moreover, this was something from tens of thousands of years ago—a secret art he had comprehended on his own back when he was still in the Emperor Realm.

Now, Tian Yan no longer needed such a secret art. As a Great Emperor, he controlled the laws of heaven and earth, and no one under the heavens could rival him. What need had he for secret arts?

It was just right to teach it to Yang Kai.

Although Heaven-Shattering Strike only had a miraculous effect on the first blow with a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, and subsequent attacks could only display the treasure’s original power, the Soul-Severing Blade itself was an Imperial Treasure. Even if Yang Kai couldn’t draw out all its power, with his current strength, if he really used it, few could withstand it.

With the addition of the Heaven-Shattering Strike, even those in the Emperor Realm would have to avoid it.

This was another trump card for both survival and desperate situations, so Yang Kai spared no effort in refining it.

In his Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai’s Spirit Body appeared, his hands constantly forming seals. The seawater within surged and gathered into waves, again and again washing over the Soul-Severing Blade.

With each wash, as Yang Kai’s hand seals changed, the Soul-Severing Blade seemed to flash with light. Its power subtly increased—almost imperceptibly, but over time, it would surely become astonishing.

The first strike would surely shake heaven and earth!

From time to time, Yang Kai would also spit out pure Divine Soul energy, blowing it onto the Soul-Severing Blade to cleanse its power.

Day after day passed. Yang Kai remained in his cave on Purple Bamboo Peak, constantly refining the Soul-Severing Blade with the Heaven-Shattering Strike secret art.

Still, he made time to visit the Small Xuan Realm to check on Hua Qingsi and Zhang Ruoxi.

Ever since Yang Kai had given Hua Qingsi that last Supreme Mystic Pill, she had accepted it without hesitation and promptly consumed it. Her attitude toward Yang Kai underwent a complete transformation—while she didn’t obey his every word, the former resistance was gone. Now, whenever they interacted, she was noticeably more gentle and agreeable than before.
