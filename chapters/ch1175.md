## Chapter 1175 — Entering

Yang Kai had been thinking he might arrange for Chang Qi and Hao An to accompany the other Yingyue Hall disciples — after all, traveling together would naturally improve their safety.

Having two middle-aged, half-grown old men squeezed among those young men and beauties felt somewhat out of place, but age can also mean experience and wisdom; their strength was not weak, and they might well be of help to those from Yingyue Hall.

When he proposed the idea, both Chang Qi and Hao An shook their heads and refused.

It wasn't that their ages were so different from the Yingyue Hall disciples that they feared not fitting in, but since they had resolved to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland to seek their own opportunities, they naturally could not act together with others; if they did, any gains would have to be shared, and the two had no intention of sticking together — once inside the Flowing Flame Sandland they planned to split up.

What they said made sense, and after thinking it over Yang Kai did not press the matter.

Two days later Qian Tong hurried over, distributed everyone's pass tokens, and also handed each person a small Secret Treasure called a Yuan Magnetic Pointer.

The Flowing Flame Sandland was vast, and inside one could not see the sun, moon, or stars; once within it was impossible to discern direction, so the Yuan Magnetic Pointer was used to orient oneself.

Wei Guchang had mentioned it to Yang Kai before; upon receiving one Yang Kai fiddled with it a few times and immediately understood how to use it.

The pointer was crafted with exquisite precision; no matter how it was turned, it always fixed its direction toward a certain specific location. With such an aid there was no need to worry about getting lost within the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Yang Kai carefully put the Yuan Magnetic Pointer away and, together with Chang Qi and Hao An, sat cross-legged to cultivate and replenish their energies.

As time passed, the dark-red energy curtain covering the Flowing Flame Sandland began to fade at a clearly perceptible pace, and unstable waves of energy from within the sandland continued to emanate.

Noticing this, everyone stood up; they understood the forbidden land was about to open and couldn't help rubbing their hands together in anticipation. Many eagerly stared at the Flowing Flame Sandland, silently daydreaming about what fortunes they might obtain inside.

Only the Origin Returning Realm experts leading the groups wore anxious expressions.

They knew the dangers of the Flowing Flame Sandland better than anyone; many of these Origin Returning Realm experts had personally ventured inside four hundred years ago. Having endured countless trials, they had barely survived to return, and those who had not entered relied on records in their sects' tomes for such accounts.

Though anxious, none of the Origin Returning Realm experts showed their emotions outwardly.

For to reap rewards one had to pay a price—even if that price was the lives of thousands. As long as the most core disciples remained unharmed, they could not be bothered.

Origin Returning Realm experts kept flying overhead, shouting encouragement for the Saint King Realm practitioners about to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland, while reminding them to be cautious and to avoid conflicts with others, to show mutual care and forbearance.

How many would heed such admonitions was uncertain; wherever there were benefits there would be disputes. Every time the Flowing Flame Sandland opened, the human loss was often twenty to thirty percent due to fighting over treasures.

Half a day later, the unstable energy fluctuations from within the Flowing Flame Sandland suddenly ceased. Immediately afterward the energy curtain, already paled, went through a dazzling transformation and then stabilized.

In one area the pale red energy curtain was even thinner, appearing like a wide-open gate.

The Flowing Flame Sandland had officially opened!

Elders from every sect shouted commands as their disciples surged forward in waves toward the entrance. Figures blurred together in the crowd — shoulders brushing, feet jostling — as nearly three thousand people rushed to gather before the gateway at once.

A dozen or so Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts stood there with predatory gazes; seeing the Saint King Realm practitioners charge forward, they unleashed their Shi.

The whole world seemed to freeze; the movements of all the Saint King Realm practitioners became rigid, every step difficult; those with weaker endurance turned pale and their clothes soaked through with sweat.

The sensation of being wrapped by Shi was nauseating—a feeling of life and death beyond one's control, as if one's very existence rested on the thought of the Shi's master.

“What are you scrambling for?” A ruddy-faced old man flew up into the air, his gaze sweeping sternly across the crowd as he barked, “Line up, all of you! Enter one at a time — whoever dares to keep pushing forward will have their qualification revoked immediately!”

At his words everyone obediently began to queue. Fortunately the entrance was not narrow and the line arranged into five columns; per the old man's order, everyone entering the Flowing Flame Sandland had to hold their pass token before them for the Origin Returning Realm experts to inspect—without a pass token no one could sneak through.

"Brother Yang, Brother Yang!"

Yang Kai had just idly taken a place at the back of a column with Chang Qi and Hao An when he heard Wei Guchang calling.

Looking toward the voice he saw Wei Guchang and Xuan'er in a nearby column, surrounded before and behind by Yingyue Hall disciples.

"Brother Wei," Yang Kai smiled at him.

"Brother Yang, once inside I'll use a Transmission Compass to send messages to everyone. If you receive my signal, it'd be best to stick with me—I still have several Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters here; together we can break through the Heat-Flame Zone sooner," Wei Guchang said, indicating the few people beside him.

Those men and women also appeared to be the Core Disciples of Yingyue Hall; though their status might not equal Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, it was close. Hearing Wei Guchang's words, they revealed puzzled expressions and grew somewhat unwilling.

In their minds, if Yang Kai, a First Stage of the Saint King Realm, really joined them he'd be a drag; as core members of Yingyue Hall, they naturally didn't want to lead an unfamiliar man like Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and said calmly, "Fine."

Wei Guchang seemed to perceive his perfunctory reply and didn't press the matter further; during their previous chats he'd noticed Yang Kai seemed intent on acting alone.

The inspection moved quickly; with a dozen or so Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts checking pass tokens, a sweep of Divine Sense could confirm identities, and one by one people were allowed through—the ranks of the over three thousand Saint King Realm practitioners visibly dwindled.

Soon it was Yang Kai's turn.

Holding his pass token aloft as countless Origin Returning Realm experts swept him with Divine Sense, Qian Tong's reminder sounded in his ear: "Nephew Yang, be extremely careful and return safely!"

Yang Kai nodded lightly to Qian Tong and stepped through the entrance.

A slight dizziness washed over him; when he regained his senses he found himself in an environment of extreme heat.

From all directions, waves of heat surged one after another; the ground beneath was baked into a reddish-brown, cracked like spiderwebs—some fissures were large as gullies, wide as canyons. As far as the eye could see nothing grew, and numerous piles of broken rocks and mounds of earth obstructed the view.

Is this the Heat-Flame Zone?

Yang Kai had not employed Saint Yuan to shield his body, yet his skin still felt a stinging burn.

Even with his body as resilient as it was, he could still feel pain — let alone the other Saint King Realm cultivators entering this place. Those whose strength was a bit weaker had to immediately circulate their Saint Yuan to shield themselves, resisting the omnipresent scorching heat.

The world's Spiritual Qi here contained strange fire poison and could not be absorbed; thus martial artists had to rely on Saint Yuan and Pills to restore strength. If one's expenditure outpaced recovery, exhaustion would come—and with it danger.

But the slight stinging meant little to Yang Kai; having survived something as perilous as a void storm with his body alone, this heat was nothing by comparison.

And this was only the perimeter—it would surely grow hotter the farther in he went.

No one else was in sight; those who had entered earlier had been transported elsewhere.

Others might not perceive the area's strangeness, but as soon as Yang Kai entered he sensed the space here was somewhat unstable—precisely that instability caused practitioners passing through the same entrance to appear in different locations within the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Ahead a pale red ribbon of fire-like Spiritual Qi drifted by like silk; Yang Kai looked up and saw many such solidified strands of fire Spiritual Qi, threading and twisting like living snakes in midair—they were quite beautiful.

As he watched, a spatial fluctuation nearby occurred, and two figures abruptly materialized to his left and right.

They were two cultivators who had passed through the entrance after him.

Both were men; before they could take in their surroundings the heat hit them and their expressions instantly changed.

One immediately circulated Saint Yuan to protect his body; the other, evidently stronger, did not, but both were soon drenched in sweat.

Yang Kai frowned and realized the one who had circulated Saint Yuan wore Yingyue Hall's robes and must be one of its disciples.

After they steadied themselves they began to look around; when the Yingyue Hall disciple noticed Yang Kai, a strange expression crossed his face.

Yet he gave no sign of greeting Yang Kai and left the area at once, moving with great speed.

The other man studied Yang Kai with interest, suddenly grinned, and familiarly asked, "Friend, interested in joining me as we travel together?"

"Not interested!" Yang Kai replied coldly.

He didn't even want to bother with Wei Guchang, let alone this unknown fellow.

The man hadn't expected such a curt refusal; he pinched his nose awkwardly, made no fuss, cupped his hands to Yang Kai in salute, and departed in another direction.
