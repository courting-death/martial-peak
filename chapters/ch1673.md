## Chapter 1673 — One Utterance Becomes a Prophecy

Not only did Fei Zhi Tu think so, the high-ranking traitors of Yingyue Hall who had pledged themselves to the Corpse Spirit Sect felt the same; one after another they looked at Qian Tong with odd expressions, their gazes like those cast at a greenhorn who knows nothing of the world.

Fang Fengqi laughed loudly: “Old man, you speak without shame and with such arrogance—do you take yourself for the Void King Realm?”

Qian Tong remained indifferent, giving no answer, his attention fixed instead on those traitors from Yingyue Hall.

Beside him, Wei Guchang looked elated and parted his lips as if to speak, but in the end restrained himself.

He longed to loudly proclaim that the Great Elder truly had reached the Void King Realm; he wanted to see how those fair‑weather opportunists would react when they learned this astonishing truth.

It would surely be a spectacle, wouldn’t it?

But since the Great Elder himself did not wish to answer, why should he rush to expose him? Wait until they witness the Great Elder’s godlike methods, and they’ll understand how terribly wrong they were.

On the high platform, Qian Tong’s voice was bleak: “I’ll give you thirty breaths to think it over! After thirty breaths, I will act personally!”

“Great Elder, do not push us too far!”

“Old ghost Qian, do you take us for nothing?”

“Even if you were the Great Elder of old, so what? Even ants still cling to life—how could we commit suicide? If you want our lives, come and take them!”

“Exactly. Qian Tong, if you make a move here today, don’t blame us for being ruthless.”

A crowd shouted angrily; it was Qian Tong’s nonchalant manner that infuriated them most.

As if he truly were in the Void King Realm? Just moving his lips a little and he could make people kill themselves?

He must have been secluded somewhere these past years—looks like he cultivated his brains into mush.

Qian Tong closed his eyes, ignoring their clamor.

Meanwhile, Xie Chen, whose limbs had been severed yet who still clung to life, seemed mentally unhinged; he suffered both body and mind and kept chuckling, a sound that crept into everyone’s ears and made their skin crawl.

“Noisy!” Fang Fengqi snorted coldly and swung his hand, slicing the void.

A blade of light slashed out like a knife, struck the high platform, and cleaved Xie Chen’s remaining body in two.

“You’ll all die… you’ll all die!” Xie Chen roared twice and then went utterly still.

Fang Fengqi’s expression shifted slightly as he glared furiously at Xie Chen’s corpse. With a cold snort, he muttered, “Useless fool—more harm than help!”

Among the Yingyue Hall traitors, Xie Chen was not the most powerful, but he was the most adept at seizing opportunity; that was why Fang Fengqi had promoted him to Hall Master, using the secret arts passed down by the Sect Master to boost his cultivation so he could rapidly reach the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Yet he turned out utterly useless. Not only did he fail to kill the two juniors as planned and steal the Heavenly Moon Silver Plate, he had his limbs cut off and was carried back like a dog.

A man like that was of no further use.

At that moment a radiance flashed on the high platform as Yang Kai appeared with Su Yan and Xia Ningshang.

Seeing Fei Zhi Tu’s pitiful state, Yang Kai’s heart tightened; he crouched, seized his wrist and circulated Saint Yuan to examine him.

“Yang Kai, you came as well.” Fei Zhi Tu grinned, his face filled with warmth and emotion.

His life had not been lived in vain—the iron‑bodied man thought—at the most critical moment not only had Qian Tong brought two juniors to rescue him, but Yang Kai had come too; his eyes grew moist.

When Su Yan and Xia Ningshang both appeared upon the high platform, the heavens themselves seemed to brighten.

The high‑rank traitors of Yingyue Hall nearly all fixed their gazes on the two women, murmuring praises and exclaiming that such flawless beauties could not be of the mortal world.

Fang Fengqi’s eyes flashed with a horrifying light. He stared at Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, his gaze roaming, a fierce possessiveness glinting deep within; as if beholding a delectable feast, he licked his lips and his breaths grew shallow.

“Senior Fei, this wound of yours…” Yang Kai examined Fei Zhi Tu’s condition for a moment, his brows furrowing as if he’d found something troubling, yet he hesitated to speak.

Fei Zhi Tu’s expression changed, growing tense.

“It’s nothing serious,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile. “Your Saint Yuan has only been sealed, and the rest are just superficial wounds.”

“Scared the hell out of me!” Fei Zhi Tu let out a long breath, then after a moment’s thought said, “Mm, he still has use for this body of mine, so naturally he wouldn’t destroy my foundation.”

“Minor wounds, Senior Fei needn’t worry. Little Senior Sister, do you have any pills suitable for him now?” Yang Kai turned to Xia Ningshang.

Xia Ningshang wordlessly took a jade bottle from her Spatial Ring and handed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it, opened the cap, and poured out a single dark‑red pill.

Fei Zhi Tu scarcely glanced and snatched it, stuffing it into his mouth.

Instantly his eyes bulged and he cried out, “This is—”

Before he could finish his words he sat cross‑legged and silently circulated his profound arts to refine the medicine; in an exceedingly short time intense energy rippled through his body and the visible wounds began to heal at a speed plain to see.

Wei Guchang and Xuan’er exchanged a glance and were inwardly shaken.

It was plain to them that the pill Xia Ningshang had just produced had to be at least Origin‑Grade, and very likely an Origin‑Grade Upper‑Level pill—otherwise the effect could not be so remarkable.

An Origin‑Grade Upper‑Level pill produced on a whim—Wei Guchang could not help but be moved.

“Thank you, Junior Sister!” Wei Guchang clasped his fists solemnly and thanked her together with Xuan’er.

Xia Ningshang’s face flushed faintly; she glanced at Yang Kai and pursed her lips: “Senior Brother is too polite. Senior Fei is our benefactor. A single pill is nothing.”

“Brother Yang, you’re a lucky man!” Wei Guchang teased Yang Kai with a wink, clearly envious of the way women clustered around him.

“Bring those two women here— they belong to me!” Fang Fengqi suddenly shouted.

Beyond his lust for Su Yan and Xia Ningshang’s beauty, the pill Xia casually produced made him green with envy.

On Dark Star, Origin‑Grade Upper‑Level pills were exceedingly rare.

So he was eager to seize Su Yan and Xia Ningshang; once he had them, the contents of their Spatial Rings would be his.

Yang Kai cast him a cold glance, his eyes like blades, icy and cutting.

Fang Fengqi felt a sudden chill in his heart for no reason, an inexplicable terror as if the other could take his life.

“Thirty breaths are up!”

At that moment Qian Tong opened his eyes and swept the crowd with a cold look, saying evenly, “Since you refuse to die, then I shall send you on your way!”

As his words fell, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted, condensing into a force visible to the naked eye that surged forward in a furious rush.

Domain Field!

The Domain Field of the Void King Realm!

The more than ten traitors of Yingyue Hall turned pale with shock, each hastily unleashing their own fields of Shi to resist. Yet before Qian Tong’s Domain Field, their Shi was laughably fragile—like eggs striking stone—shattering instantly without offering the slightest defense.

In the blink of an eye a dozen or so Origin Returning Realm experts bled and tumbled backwards, faces drained of color.

The mighty Domain Field enveloped them, and within its bounds wind moved with sentient vigor.

That was the unique power contained within Qian Tong’s Domain Field!

Wind gathered into blades and began to rampage.

Screams rose in waves; those dozen or so Origin Returning Realm cultivators wrapped inside the Domain Field suffered the severest torment—the wind blades sliced at their flesh like silken threads, leaving them bloodied and mangled.

“Void King Realm!” everyone cried in terror. Fang Fengqi nearly popped his eyes out, trembling as he stared at the enraged Qian Tong, a coldness settling in his heart.

It had only been a taunt, but the words became a prophecy—Qian Tong truly was a Void King Realm cultivator!

“Great Elder, spare us! I know my mistake!”

“Great Elder, have mercy!”

Just as had happened outside Tianyun City before, when these traitors realized Qian Tong’s might and their helplessness they begged for mercy; some lost all shame and flung themselves down, banging their heads against the ground until their faces were covered in blood, pleading to stir Qian Tong’s compassion and survive.

Qian Tong’s expression remained cold and unmoved, yet in the depths of his eyes there was a trace of sorrow.

Blood spattered and flesh was scattered; within ten breaths those dozen or so Yingyue Hall traitors were carved limb from limb, almost every one reduced to a stark white skeleton, the flesh gone from their bones, their organs ground to powder.

“Good! Kill them well!”

“Kill them, don’t let them escape!”

“Avenge the children and women who died in Tianyun City!”

“Kill them!”

The onlookers suddenly roared and surged from all directions, hatred carved deep into every face; Saint Yuan flowed, weapons seized, secret arts activated and Secret Treasures brought forth as they launched assaults on the surviving enemies.

The area around Fang Fengqi—within a radius of thirty zhang—was instantly drowned in multicolored lights.

Even the beautiful young woman who had served Fang Fengqi did not escape the mob’s fury; though she possessed the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, she could not hold her protective Saint Yuan for even three breaths before it was broken and she died miserably on the spot.

A streak of light shot skyward, carving a bloody path through the crowd as someone forced their way out and fled.

“Fang Fengqi!”

After all, as a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert he would not die so easily.

He did not look back, frantically urging his strength onward to escape—now that Qian Tong had become Void King Realm, staying would mean certain death; no matter what, he had to report this news to the Four Protectors and the Sect Master.

He could feel that Qian Tong had no intention of pursuing him, still standing there motionless.

Though he did not know whether the other simply disdained to strike him, Fang Fengqi rejoiced inwardly, thinking he might survive.

While he was thinking this, the world momentarily blurred and a youth suddenly blocked his path.
