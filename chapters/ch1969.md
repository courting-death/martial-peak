## Chapter 1969 — Not Liu Yan

“Are you certain you want to give these two swords to me? They aren't of little value.” Yang Kai looked at Mo Xiaoqi, frowning as he asked.

“If Brother Yang finds it unsuitable, how about I trade that Chongying Ruler for you?” Xu Qing asked eagerly from the side; he wasn't an idiot and plainly understood the value gap between the Chongying Ruler and these two swords.

Yang Kai glanced at him and gave a cold smile.

Xu Qing felt a little embarrassed, awkwardly scratching his head.

Mo Xiaoqi smiled and said, “But I don't possess the Secret Treasure Eldest Brother needs — only these two swords roughly meet the requirement. If Eldest Brother does not mind, please accept them.”

“Ahem… since you put it that way, I will respectfully comply.” Yang Kai took the purple-green twin swords from Mo Xiaoqi's hands, tossed them into the Xuan Realm Pearl, and sent them to the Yao Worm Matriarch so it could become familiar with refining this Secret Treasure.

Only then did Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei withdraw their reluctant gazes; thinking that the benefactor was right there and perhaps more rewards awaited, their composures returned. They exchanged a look, and in that glance something seemed to be silently communicated between them.

Mo Xiaoqi remained completely unaware of this. Seeing all three had accepted her offering, she wore a delighted smile and said, “So are we agreed? If we truly catch that little creature later, please honor your promises — I'll reward you handsomely.”

“Naturally, naturally.” Xu Qing resumed his genial smile.

“No time to waste — let's go.” Yang Kai urged. While the group had been discussing, many teams had already gathered and were heading into Yuqing Mountain; he worried about Liu Yan's condition and was eager to find her.

“Follow me.” Mo Xiaoqi turned and led the way.

“After you, Brother Yang!” Xu Qing beamed and gestured politely.

Yang Kai calmly said, “You two go ahead. I'll bring up the rear.”

Xu Qing smiled slightly and did not refuse. “Very well. Thank you, Brother Yang.”

With that he immediately followed. Yu Ruomei nodded lightly to Yang Kai and entered Yuqing Mountain as well, while Yang Kai glanced around left and right before going in last.

Yuqing Mountain stretched on for untold tens of thousands of li, its forests deep and frequented by ferocious beasts, but the four of them were all cultivators of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; together they could contend even with a Dao Origin Realm–level demonic beast. They were not overly fearful, and since they hadn't ventured far into the mountain's interior, there were no truly powerful demonic beasts present.

Mo Xiaoqi seemed to truly know the Fire Bird's exact location. After entering Yuqing Mountain she needed no direction-finding, simply leading them straight along at great speed.

Her conduct gave Yang Kai a bit more confidence in her.

What surprised Yang Kai, however, was that throughout the journey Mo Xiaoqi showed no signs of guarding against the other three; she acted as if she trusted them completely.

Between Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei, who flanked the middle, faint concealed soul-energy fluctuations were emitted; they were clearly communicating something silently.

They fancied themselves covert, which was laughable. But before Yang Kai's powerful Divine Sense — which exceeded that of a typical Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator — nothing escaped notice.

In that party, Mo Xiaoqi's background was mysterious, Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei were furtive, and Yang Kai harbored his own schemes; who would have the last laugh remained uncertain.

As they went, they could faintly hear the sound of sky-splitting flight from afar — clearly other teams searching for the Fire Bird's whereabouts.

But as time passed such noises grew fewer, and the place where the four stood sank ever deeper into Yuqing Mountain's interior.

After half a day, the guide Mo Xiaoqi suddenly halted; the other three naturally came to an immediate stop as well.

“I last saw it in the hollow just up ahead. Prepare yourselves for battle.” Mo Xiaoqi warned them.

Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei nodded and secretly urged their inner strength, ready to strike at a moment's notice.

Yang Kai's brow tightened, because if Liu Yan were truly ahead he should have sensed her, yet he had felt nothing; this meant only two possibilities.

One possibility was that Liu Yan had already left the hollow ahead and had taken up residence elsewhere.

The second possibility, which Yang Kai did not wish to face, was that the one in Yuqing Mountain was not Liu Yan, and thus he could not sense her.

Mo Xiaoqi had already cast a concealment technique to hide her presence and stifle her aura and energy fluctuations; Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei did the same.

The three used different secret techniques, and their relative strengths were immediately apparent.

After Mo Xiaoqi performed her skill her breath and life fluctuations vanished entirely; without naked‑eye observation even Yang Kai would find it difficult to detect her — a clear sign her technique was of a very high order.

Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei were far inferior by comparison; to Yang Kai's eye they were passable, but utterly unmatched next to Mo Xiaoqi.

Yang Kai also employed a technique to draw in and stifle his aura.

Nothingness!

He did not unleash Nothingness's entire might, only a slight manifestation, which kept him sufficiently concealed while avoiding the risk of exposing the secret of his spatial art.

What Yang Kai had not expected was that after he displayed a weakened form of the Nothingness technique, Mo Xiaoqi actually glanced back at him; puzzlement flickered in her beautiful eyes before she turned away, seeming bewildered.

That girl… had she seen through something? Yang Kai's heart leaped.

The four silently approached the hollow and soon arrived above it. Looking down, Mo Xiaoqi let out a small exclamation.

“What is it?” Xu Qing snapped in alarm.

“It's not here.” Mo Xiaoqi said, then she rose and flew straight down into the hollow.

The remaining three exchanged a look and, no longer bothering to hide, followed closely behind Mo Xiaoqi.

The hollow showed signs of a fierce battle having just occurred: scorched traces everywhere, several charred corpses on the ground in a grisly state, and the air reeking of burnt flesh and stink that made one sick.

The scene made everyone's eyes narrow.

The circumstances also indirectly confirmed Mo Xiaoqi's words — the Fire Bird had indeed nested here earlier, but had apparently been disturbed by intruders; after a great battle it had slain its foes and then departed.

“Is this… the Jiang Family's Third Elder?” Xu Qing looked down at an old man in a brown robe and whispered.

He clearly recognized the elder; although the man had been burned to death, his features were still just discernible.

“What was his cultivation level?” Yang Kai asked.

Xu Qing's expression turned grave. “The Jiang Family in Fenglin City is not weak. The Third Elder had the Third Stage of the Void King Realm — on par with us.”

“This is the deputy leader of the Red Leaf Palace? He actually died here?” Yu Ruomei covered her mouth, her beautiful eyes trembling.

As more fallen cultivators were identified, it became clear the corpses were all cultivators of the Second and Third Stages of the Void King Realm, and there were quite a number of them — eight in total.

Eight experts of the Second and Third Stages of the Void King Realm had joined forces yet were all slain by the Fire Bird here; the discovery made Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei's faces fall.

Facing the eight corpses, they suddenly felt this operation had been too rash; everyone seemed to have underestimated the Fire Bird's strength.

After all, the four of them — the two of them plus Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi — numbered only four Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivators; in terms of numbers and collective strength they were no match for the eight who had died before them.

If those eight had met with such a grim fate, how could the four of them possibly succeed?

At the thought, Xu Qing and Yu Ruomei faltered, their faces darkening.

Yang Kai also furrowed his brow.

He knew Liu Yan's strength well; even if she was a handful, she could not possibly have the power to slay so many at once.

Their hesitation was noticed by Mo Xiaoqi, who suddenly spoke: “Do not worry too much. Though that little creature killed many, it was injured as well.”

“How do you know?” Yang Kai looked up at her.

“There are traces of its blood on the ground.” Mo Xiaoqi smiled slightly and pointed to a spot on the earth.

At that spot there appeared to be a pool of dark red, but flames raged all around it. Yang Kai had not paid much attention before; now with Mo Xiaoqi's reminder he finally noticed.

Not Liu Yan!

At the sight of the blood, Yang Kai felt a deep disappointment.

The Fire Bird in Yuqing Mountain was clearly not Liu Yan — Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit and not flesh-and-blood; even wounded she could not bleed. Moreover, the blood here contained unimaginable searing power that set the surrounding ground ablaze, unable to be extinguished.

Realizing this, Yang Kai lost all heart.

He had come to Yuqing Mountain because of Liu Yan, so learning the truth left him utterly disappointed.

“In that case, we might still have some chance,” Xu Qing said, frowning as he pondered.

Although the Jiang Family's Third Elder and his party had been annihilated, they had wounded the Fire Bird; if the four of them planned carefully, there might yet be a chance to succeed.

“If we really encounter that Fire Bird, how should we act? Shouldn't we discuss it carefully?” Yu Ruomei asked — the eight dead before them made her uneasy; had it not been for Mo Xiaoqi's promised reward she might have already left.

Treasure is fine, but you must live to enjoy it.

“We should strategize. Everyone briefly state the secret arts and strengths you are proficient in so we can coordinate.” Xu Qing proposed.

Hearing this, Yang Kai cast a meaningful glance at him.

Mo Xiaoqi waved her hand with a smile and said, “No need. If we run into it, the three of you only need to buy me some time — I have a way to deal with it.”

She wore a look of certain victory; no one knew where her confidence came from.
