## Chapter 2504 — The One Who Will Kill You Is Named Yang Kai

“A Divine Soul Imperial Treasure!” Wu Kuang’s eyes narrowed as he stared blankly at the long blade gripped in Yang Kai’s hand, unable to stop himself from exclaiming in shock.

Imperial Treasures were always rare, let alone a Divine Soul Imperial Treasure. Out of a thousand Imperial Treasures, there might not even be one artifact specifically driven by Divine Soul power, which showed just how precious it was.

Wu Kuang had never expected that Yang Kai would possess a Divine Soul Imperial Treasure. Earlier, this brat had hidden the long blade somewhere in his Sea of Consciousness, so well that even he hadn’t noticed it.

Now things were a bit troublesome. A Divine Soul Imperial Treasure, meant to harm the soul, combined with Yang Kai’s rich and pure Divine Soul power, might actually be able to inflict some damage on him.

Although he felt some apprehension in his heart, Wu Kuang’s face still showed disdain as he sneered, “A fine treasure, but if you want to kill this Lord, it’s still not enough.”

Yang Kai’s expression was solemn. He ran his fingers along the blade, and the Soul-Severing Blade’s humming instantly ceased. He pointed the Soul-Severing Blade at Wu Kuang from afar and said coldly, “This treasure is called the Soul-Severing Blade. To die beneath this blade, Wu Kuang, you can count yourself thrice blessed.”

“Hahahaha!” Wu Kuang couldn’t help but burst out laughing, finding Yang Kai’s shameless boasting amusing. Clicking his tongue, he said, “This Lord won’t deny it, this Imperial Treasure might pose some threat to me, but if you want to kill this Lord, brat, you’d better go cultivate for another few tens of thousands of years.”

Yang Kai replied mockingly, “If that’s the case, then please watch closely, Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he urged his Divine Soul power, and the calm seawater below began to churn and roar, pouring into the blade. In an instant, the Soul-Severing Blade shone brilliantly, dazzling the eyes.

But that wasn’t all. Yang Kai formed seals with his hands, continuously slapping them onto the Soul-Severing Blade.

Power and killing intent surged out together, so thick they seemed almost tangible.

Wu Kuang’s expression gradually grew serious as he quietly mobilized his own strength, seemingly preparing some kind of defense.

Zing…

A clear, strange sound rang out. The Soul-Severing Blade’s aura seemed to have been pushed to its limit. It kept quivering in front of Yang Kai, as if it wanted to break free from his grasp and slash at the enemy.

At that moment, a strange light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes as he chanted in a low voice, “Heaven-Shattering Strike!”

A mysterious force flowed out, enveloping the Soul-Severing Blade. Instantly, a thin layer of pale gold covered the dazzling blade, and with its appearance, the Soul-Severing Blade’s aura soared several times over.

“What secret technique is this!” Wu Kuang cried out in shock, unable to hide his horror.

As a Great Emperor, he could naturally sense the change in the Soul-Severing Blade. He had no idea what trick Yang Kai had used, but its power had suddenly increased severalfold.

If the Soul-Severing Blade’s power had only surprised him a little before, now it truly made him fearful.

Because he could clearly feel that the Divine Soul Imperial Treasure’s might was now enough to threaten his Spirit Body.

Yang Kai’s expression was icy as he shouted, “Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, the one who kills you is named Yang Kai!”

As soon as he finished, he waved his hand, and the Soul-Severing Blade transformed into a stream of light. Like an arrow loosed from a bow, it shot toward the two Great Emperors, falling like a blazing sun, carrying world-destroying power.

The Heaven-Shattering Strike was a secret technique Yang Kai had learned from Tian Yan in the Divine Roaming Mirror within the Qingyang Shrine’s secret realm.

Although Tian Yan was only a Divine Soul without a physical body, his cultivation was at the Great Emperor Realm. And because he had no body, he spent his life studying Divine Soul power, so his soul techniques were even stronger than those of Wu Kuang and Duan Hongchen.

The Heaven-Shattering Strike was especially terrifying.

Normally, Yang Kai would use his own Divine Soul power to slowly nourish the Soul-Severing Blade, letting it accumulate strength over time. When the moment of need arrived, he could unleash all that stored power in a single, explosive strike—its destructive force was simply unimaginable. Although each use would exhaust the accumulated power and require him to start over, this secret technique could often decide the outcome at a critical juncture.

The Soul-Severing Blade, a Divine Soul Imperial Treasure, was the perfect match for the Heaven-Shattering Strike—each complemented the other, their powers intertwined and mutually enhancing.

“A mere ant wants to kill this Lord!” Wu Kuang roared hysterically, no longer showing any of his previous disdain or contempt. Yang Kai’s attack had forced him to take it seriously.

As he spoke, he desperately tried to break free from Duan Hongchen’s restraint, but how could Duan Hongchen let him? Laughing madly, he shouted, “Wu Kuang, stop struggling! Wouldn’t it be wonderful for the two of us to go to the Yellow Springs together? We can be companions on the road to the underworld!”

“Get lost!” Wu Kuang shouted, his power becoming extremely unstable.

Duan Hongchen’s expression changed slightly. Although he didn’t know what Wu Kuang was planning, he knew this was the best chance to kill him, so he used all his strength to bind him, preparing to face that terrifying strike.

The sun-like radiance fell, enveloping the Spirit Bodies of the two Great Emperors.

Wu Kuang’s miserable screams rang out immediately, occasionally mixed with Duan Hongchen’s muffled groans.

It seemed that neither of them was having an easy time under this move.

After unleashing this move, Yang Kai immediately turned around and fled to the island formed by the Warm Spirit Lotus, once again activating the seven-colored glow to shield himself.

Rumble…

The massive shockwaves exploded, causing the entire Sea of Consciousness to boil over. Towering waves surged in all directions, and at the very center of the attack, a huge pit was blasted out.

Yang Kai’s head felt like it was splitting open. Using his own secret technique and secret treasure to attack his own Sea of Consciousness—he had never even imagined such a thing before, but today he had no choice.

The pain was even more intense than when the two Great Emperors had fought earlier. Yang Kai felt as if he was drowning in agony, his head spinning, nearly passing out on the spot.

Boom boom boom…

The aftershocks continued to spread, as if they would last until the end of time.

No one knew how long it took before the terrifying commotion finally subsided and the dazzling light gradually faded away.

Grimacing in pain, Yang Kai’s first reaction was to check on Wu Kuang and Duan Hongchen. But after sweeping his Divine Sense over the area, his expression changed.

In the Sea of Consciousness, only Duan Hongchen’s Spirit Body was left floating in a sorry state. At this moment, a huge gash ran from his shoulder blade to his abdomen, nearly splitting him in two. Threads of pure Divine Soul power leaked from the wound, causing his aura to grow weaker and weaker.

He looked around with difficulty and asked, “Where’s Wu Kuang? Has he been utterly destroyed?”

Yang Kai replied grimly, “He escaped!”

When he checked earlier, he had clearly sensed someone tearing through his Divine Sense defenses and fleeing from here.

Since Duan Hongchen was still here, the one who escaped could only be Wu Kuang.

Hearing this, Duan Hongchen’s face changed. Forcing himself to stand, he shouted, “Brat, send me out!”

Without a word, Yang Kai waved his hand and sent him out of his Sea of Consciousness.

After finishing this, Yang Kai’s body swayed and he nearly collapsed.

Although he wanted to check whether Wu Kuang and Duan Hongchen would continue fighting, his own condition forced him to give up on the idea.

No matter what happened to others, if he didn’t recuperate now, he really wouldn’t be able to hold on.

This time, the battle between the two Great Emperors in his Sea of Consciousness had brought him great benefits, but also left him covered in wounds.

The Warm Spirit Lotus bloomed with gentle, multicolored light, radiating outward through his Sea of Consciousness under Yang Kai’s guidance. Its soothing glow steadily mended the shattered Sea of Consciousness and healed his wounded Spirit Body.

Only after half a day did Yang Kai feel his condition stabilize a little.

It was only then that he was able to act again.

The first thing he did was send his Spirit Body out of his Sea of Consciousness, returning to his physical body.

When Yang Kai opened his eyes, he found himself still drifting within the Void Passage, carried along by the chaotic currents, destination unknown.

Not far ahead, Duan Hongchen was sitting cross-legged.

Yang Kai swallowed nervously and carefully checked his condition, discovering that Duan Hongchen still had a breath of life, but it was extremely weak, and even the fluctuations of Emperor Yuan in his body were almost undetectable.

Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief—at least Duan Hongchen was still alive.

Although he hadn’t held back at all when using the Soul-Severing Blade earlier, he had truly feared that he might kill Duan Hongchen while killing Wu Kuang. Even though this was the Mortal Great Emperor’s own request and wish, how could Yang Kai bear to kill a Great Emperor he respected?

Since both he and Duan Hongchen were here, where had Wu Kuang gone?

Wu Kuang’s physical body was definitely destroyed, and his Spirit Body was surely badly wounded. In this Void Passage, where could he go? If he wandered around in a place like this, he would eventually be swallowed by the chaotic void currents. Even if he had once been the number one in the Star Realm, dragging such a ruined body, he couldn’t survive.

It seemed Wu Kuang was truly doomed.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai was overjoyed.

But after carefully checking Duan Hongchen’s condition again, Yang Kai couldn’t help but worry. Duan Hongchen’s aura was so weak, he looked as if he could die at any moment. If Yang Kai didn’t do something, he might not survive this calamity either.

Yang Kai hurriedly took out all kinds of Healing Pills from his Spatial Ring, apologized, pried open Duan Hongchen’s mouth, stuffed the pills in, and then used his power to help him refine them.

As soon as he channeled his power, Yang Kai immediately noticed something strange.

The power in his body was actually extremely pure Emperor Yuan! There wasn’t a trace of impurity.

What was going on? Yang Kai was both shocked and delighted.

Every cultivator, after advancing to the Emperor Realm, had to spend a great deal of time converting their Origin Qi into Emperor Yuan. No one could avoid this process. For some, it took a few years; for others, decades or even a hundred years. It was just like how new Dao Origin Realm cultivators had to convert their Origin Qi.

But he had clearly just broken through, so why had all his Origin Qi already been converted to Emperor Yuan?

Thinking back carefully, when he first broke through, his Origin Qi had indeed been rapidly converting to Emperor Yuan, but before he could pay attention to it, he was swept into the Void Passage, then invaded by Wu Kuang in his Sea of Consciousness. By the time he came out, his power had already fully transformed.

He had no idea at which point things had gone awry, but this was a stroke of incredibly good fortune.

Perhaps it was related to the ordeal he faced during his breakthrough, or maybe it was due to the insights he gained from the two Great Emperors fighting in his Sea of Consciousness. Either way, it had saved Yang Kai at least several years of time.
