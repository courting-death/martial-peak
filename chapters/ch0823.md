## Chapter 823 — Far Too Arrogant

After a full day and night of busy work, everything had been arranged properly.

As thousands of disciples of the Sacred Land poured into the Sacred Tomb, that gloomy Small Xuan Realm suddenly brimmed with life.

Though their numbers were large, the Sacred Tomb still held them with room to spare.

Xu Hui and the others had also planned ahead and prepared ample supplies for daily life—enough for the disciples of the Sacred Land to live inside for a very, very long time.

Yang Kai told them as well to set matters aside for now and cultivate here with a calm heart. When the time came, he would naturally let them out again.

Xu Hui and the others agreed readily.

After leaving the Sacred Tomb, Yang Kai sat alone, cross‑legged on the summit of a peak among the Nine Peaks. Looking down over the vast foundation built over countless years, his mood was calm.

At this moment, Nine Heavens Sacred Land lay utterly silent. Aside from him, not a single figure could be seen.

He sank his mind, circulated his art in silence, and began to wait quietly.

No one knew how much time passed before Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, fixed his gaze in one direction, and grinned—silent and cryptic.

Zhang Ao and his lot had come again, cursing and hurling abuse in front of the barrier as they bombarded it wildly. Thunderous booms echoed among the Nine Peaks, grating on the ears.

Yang Kai’s figure blurred—and when he appeared again, he stood not far in front of Zhang Ao and the others.

Zhang Ao’s eyes narrowed as he barked, “Brat, you still dare come out? Today you’ll die without a doubt!”

At his side, Cao Guan sneered without end. “Open the barrier and come out to surrender. We can spare your life!”

Yang Kai acted as if he hadn’t heard. His gaze swept the crowd, pausing a heartbeat on the Duao Alliance before moving on. “Very well. Since you’re all bent on being enemies of the Sacred Land, then seek your own fortunes.”

Quite a few people averted their eyes in wary fear. On the Duao Alliance’s side, Yun Xuan’s expression was especially bleak.

The night before, she had discussed things with Yun Cheng at length and conveyed Yang Kai’s suggestion, but now the Duao Alliance was riding a tiger; Yun Cheng could only come along with Zhang Ao and the others.

Seeing him again now, Yun Xuan couldn’t help feeling guilty for letting down Yang Kai’s good intentions.

“Where’s Xu Hui? Why is it only you, a snot‑nosed kid?” Zhang Ao keenly sensed that something was wrong. Nine Heavens Sacred Land was far too quiet today. Not only were there no signs of movement inside, but the only one to come out to meet the enemy was this new Saint Lord. Xu Hui and the others hadn’t shown themselves at all.

“To deal with you, there’s no need for the Great Elder to lift a finger,” Yang Kai said with a curl of his lip.

“Arrogant! Once I’ve taken you, we’ll see if you can still strut.” Zhang Ao was thoroughly provoked. He waved his great hand and shouted, “Everyone, don’t hold back. I’ll pin the brat—combine your strength and break this damned barrier. When we’re done, we’ll share the Nine Peaks’ foundations!”

At his words, the eyes of many who had been wavering at once burned hot.

Nine Heavens Sacred Land had deep heritage. Who knew how many rare treasures, Spirit‑Grade Pills and wondrous medicines, or profound arts and Martial Skills were stored within? Gaining even a little would be a windfall beyond measure.

Men die for wealth like birds for food. Throwing out a lure like that was bound to kindle many a fighting spirit.

In a flash, under the lead of Cao Guan and Wu Jie, over a dozen Saint Realm experts struck together and pounded the barrier. Zhang Ao again sent out his Secret Treasure, forced through the barrier’s blockade, and blasted at Yang Kai—clearly, as he’d said, to keep Yang Kai occupied.

Yang Kai chuckled. He had no intention of crossing blows with Zhang Ao. His body drifted back out of range, avoiding the attacks as he watched coolly from the side, not even considering stopping them from hammering the barrier.

A jolt went through Zhang Ao’s heart, and a sense of foreboding rose unbidden. He locked his eyes on Yang Kai, wanting to see what trick he was playing.

Sss, sss, sss…

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Shrill sounds of air being torn rang out as countless attacks crashed down on the barrier. To everyone’s surprise, the barrier around Nine Heavens Sacred Land seemed like paper today, unable to withstand a single blow.

Joining forces, the many experts needed not even thirty breaths before the barrier enveloping the Nine Peaks shattered with a roar, leaving the road ahead unobstructed.

Everyone froze, as if they hadn’t expected things to go so smoothly.

After a moment’s daze, Zhang Ao was overjoyed and bellowed, “Brat, let’s see where you run now!”

As he spoke, he and the dozen Saint Realm experts darted into the Nine Peaks and surrounded Yang Kai on all sides.

Right behind them, the gathered forces streamed in as well, afraid that going a step slower would let others snatch all the spoils.

Duao Alliance’s leader, Yun Cheng, wore a shifting expression as he sent his Divine Sense out to probe within the Nine Peaks. After a moment, his face moved, and he strode forward too.

He hadn’t gone far when he felt someone tug his clothes. Turning back, he found Yun Xuan looking at him with pleading eyes.

“Xuan’er, what is it?” Yun Cheng asked with a frown.

“Father… the Nine Peaks’ barrier is broken. Let them handle the rest. Let’s go back now!” Yun Xuan said, biting her red lip.

“Go back now?” Yun Cheng thought for a moment and smiled gently. “Didn’t I explain everything to you the night before? Why are you saying this again?”

“Please, Father—believe me. Staying will do us no good.”

“She’s right, Alliance Master—this is the time to leave, while all their attention is on that bastard,” Ruan Xinyu urged.

“You think so too?” Yun Cheng gave Ruan Xinyu a thoughtful look. “Do you trust that boy so much?”

The night before, Yun Xuan had relayed Yang Kai’s suggestion. Yun Cheng also knew that this new Saint Lord had met his daughter the day prior, but he hadn’t taken Yang Kai’s suggestion seriously. The disparity in strength was too great—he truly couldn’t imagine any way for Nine Heavens Sacred Land to turn danger into safety. Their only reliance was the array and barrier of the Nine Peaks, but even that reliance they had now abandoned.

“Xuan’er, is it that old feelings keep you from kicking him when he’s down?” Yun Cheng laid bare the concern in Yun Xuan’s heart. “Don’t worry. If he truly has the ability to survive this calamity, one more Duao Alliance won’t make a difference. If he doesn’t, one less Duao Alliance won’t either… But to my eye, he’s already at the end of his rope. A pity.”

Yun Cheng sighed. He had thought this was the perfect chance for the Duao Alliance to grow strong. After all, his daughter had ties to Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saint Lord—if the boy weathered this tribulation, would the Duao Alliance lack a backer in the future?

But as things stood, Nine Heavens Sacred Land seemed strong on the outside but hollow within.

At this most critical moment, only the new Saint Lord had come out to face the enemy. The elders and protectors, along with all the disciples, were nowhere to be seen.

It made Yun Cheng suspect that this new Saint Lord had been abandoned here to draw Zhang Ao’s attention, an expendable pawn to let the others escape.

“Don’t worry—Zhang Ao can’t bear to kill him,” Yun Cheng reassured her. “That boy is of great use to Zhang Ao.”

Zhang Ao had gathered so many forces and experts to make trouble for Nine Heavens Sacred Land for the sake of its inheritance. Now that inheritance should be in Yang Kai’s hands—how could Zhang Ao bear to kill him?

“If you don’t want to be his enemy… then go hide far away with Xinyu,” Yun Cheng said, then ordered Ji Yan, “Take the young miss somewhere safe.”

“Yes.” Ji Yan answered in a deep voice. True Yuan surged as he swept up Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu and flew off.

Yun Xuan’s face was full of bitterness. She wanted to keep persuading him but didn’t know where to start. Her beautiful eyes held only worry as she looked at Yang Kai, surrounded by experts, growing farther and farther away.

Only after his daughter left did Yun Cheng give a soft snort and fly forward.

“Brat, you’re at death’s door—submit now!” Zhang Ao shouted at Yang Kai, brows brimming with smugness and eyes alight, as if he already held Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s inheritance in his grasp.

Cao Guan joined in the shouting, trying to persuade Yang Kai to surrender—telling him not to put up a pointless fight, or else he’d bear the consequences.

Yang Kai looked at them coolly without saying a word.

He stood was sealed on every side—above and below, front and back—airtight. Over a dozen Saint Realm experts and dozens of Transcendent Realm cultivators all eyed him like wolves, their expressions unfriendly.

Yet his breezy calm made everyone wary in secret. No one dared to be the first to rush him and court disaster.

This was the Nine Peaks. Previously, leveraging the Nine Peaks’ power, Yang Kai had displayed methods on par with the Saint Realm. If they forced him, no one but Zhang Ao could hope to stop him.

“Kid, you’re not up to much after all. What a disappointment,” said Wu Jie of Netherworld Sect meaningfully, cackling oddly.

Yang Kai gave him a sidelong glance and smiled easily. “And what is it you want?”

Wu Jie slowly shook his head, a green miasma rolling around him, ghastly as a specter. “I thought you had a few more surprises, but it seems I overestimated you. If this is all, I advise you to surrender. Let me seal your True Yuan, lest Brother Zhang and Brother Cao injure you by accident.”

“Heh. I appreciate the kindness,” Yang Kai said with a light laugh. “But with just the likes of you trying to take me, I’m afraid you’re biting off more than you can chew.”

“Far too arrogant!” Cao Guan fumed. No Transcendent Realm cultivator dared spout off before so many in the Saint Realm. The boy’s disregard for them had clearly reached a peak.

“Hall Master…” A figure rushed over and reported to Cao Guan, “There’s not a single person inside. All of Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s disciples are gone.”

“Not one?” Cao Guan was dumbfounded.

“Mm.”

At the same time, Zhang Ao, Wu Jie, and the others received the same report. The discovery made them wary despite themselves. Their faces turned grave—they had no idea what game Nine Heavens Sacred Land was playing.

For thousands of people to vanish without a trace—this was far too abnormal.

A faint unease rose in Zhang Ao’s heart, and he decided not to delay any longer.

The longer this drags on, the more can go wrong.

He roared, “All of you, with me—seize this brat first. As long as we have him in hand, even if Xu Hui and the others have heaven‑toppling skill, they won’t be able to stir up any waves.”
