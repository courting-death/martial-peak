## Chapter 485 — Di Mo Strikes

The dark red mysterious light shot out from Di Mo, thick and viscous like fresh blood.

The mysterious light surged forward, carrying a bloodthirsty, sinister, and savage aura. The martial artists of Yang Kang’s estate all changed expression, hastily moving to intercept.

But no matter what, they could not block the assault of this mysterious light.

With a thunderous boom, the light struck the ground, gouging a deep pit in the earth.

A beast-like roar echoed out, and a violent aura suddenly spread, shaking everyone’s spirit.

When they focused their gaze, the martial artists of Yang Kang’s estate were stunned.

Within that deep pit, a figure stood—his features blurred, the face indistinct. His entire body emanated overwhelming bloody aura, and his eyes glowed a terrifying crimson.

With his roar, enormous blood bubbles suddenly rose from the earth.

Pop! Pop!

The blood bubbles exploded, dyeing the ground red. Quickly, the earth became dense and sticky, as if there was a blood spring beneath, continuously spewing blood onto the surface.

“What the hell is that?” Everyone felt a foreboding, though no one could identify exactly what it was. It looked somewhat human, but it was not. Its eyes held no trace of human emotion, only boundless slaughter.

Yet it did possess all human-like features, except for a huge bulge on its forehead, grotesquely strange.

“Senior, what is this?” Qiu Yimeng’s face shifted slightly. Though she had long sensed Di Mo was no good, seeing such a scene made her realize she had severely underestimated his moral depravity.

As she stared at the monstrous figure below, a chilling sensation crept into her heart.

“Hehe… This is the puppet Blood Demon I forged!” Di Mo said proudly, clearly proud of his creation.

Qiu Yimeng rubbed her forehead and said no more.

The said Blood Demon had already begun merciless slaughter. The ground was covered in thick blood that had a strong adhesive property. Any martial artists stained by this blood found themselves immobilized, tightly controlled in place.

With a wild roar, the Blood Demon charged at a martial artist, shattering him with a single hand, reducing him to a blood mist. That blood mist was then absorbed by the Blood Demon’s body, seemingly augmenting his strength.

The red figure flickered. In less than ten breaths, every martial artist entangled by the blood was killed thoroughly.

The Blood Demon still showed no sign of stopping; wherever he moved, the blood spread. Anyone stained below the Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage would be utterly unable to break free regardless of their effort. Their only fate was death.

“Kill him!” Yang Kang, seeing the Blood Demon’s terrifying destruction, quickly ordered his elite subordinates.

Several Divine Roaming Realm Sixth and Seventh Stage experts dared not approach the Blood Demon closely and summoned their treasures. They unleashed their proudest martial skills at the Blood Demon.

Despite his speed and evasiveness, he was struck repeatedly by the overwhelming onslaught.

They showed no mercy, shattering the Blood Demon’s legs and sending him crashing headlong into the sea of blood.

“Pathetic!” Yang Kang snorted coldly upon seeing this, his slight worry easing. Letting such a monster run rampant was terrifying enough for the weaker martial artists on his side, regardless of his combat strength.

“Senior…” Qiu Yimeng also froze for a moment. She hadn’t expected Di Mo’s puppet to look so terrifying yet actually be so mediocre.

Di Mo chuckled sinisterly, “Just wait.”

No sooner had he spoken than the Blood Demon, despite having broken legs, propped himself up on one hand. At his severed limbs, blood in the sea was being voraciously absorbed.

As he absorbed the blood, the broken limbs writhed and sprouted like bamboo shoots after rain, something emerging from them.

In mere moments, two perfectly formed legs had regenerated.

“Impossible!” a shout of astonishment erupted, not only from the martial artists of Yang Kang’s estate but from Qiu Yimeng and the others as well.

Even after having his legs broken, he could regenerate. Is he still human?

This bizarre scene completely exceeded everyone’s understanding.

“I’ll join the fun too!” Di Mo sneered, transforming into a streak of light and shooting downwards.

The rarely seen Soul-Breaking Spike whirled on his shoulder like a living Divine Pill, radiating overwhelming energy fluctuations.

The Soul-Breaking Spike had now fully recovered to a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure level!

Sensing the eerie aura and immense pressure emanating from Di Mo, all the martial artists of Yang Kang’s estate were astonished. Tang Yuxian’s expression grew extremely solemn: “Fifth Young Master, do not leave my side.”

Yang Kang’s lips cracked, and he nodded involuntarily, suddenly feeling a hopeless sense of being cornered.

Among the two Blood Servants, Tu Feng was incapacitated, and the estate had no Divine Roaming Realm top experts. How could they resist this sinister aura warrior?

Tang Yuxian alone might delay a while, but if Tang Yuxian was restrained, who could guarantee Yang Kang’s safety?

A glance from that man sent shivers down Yang Kang’s spine, as if his soul were about to be drained.

Before he could think further, Di Mo began his assault, unleashing all manner of sinister martial skills. The Soul-Breaking Spike darted seamlessly like a ghost through the enemy lines, single-handedly throwing the martial artists of Yang Kang’s estate into chaos.

Coupled with the Blood Demon causing havoc nearby, Yang Kang’s estate fell into panic, unable to mount effective resistance.

“Why do I feel... we didn’t really need to come here?” Huo Xingchen’s scalp tingled. Watching Di Mo and Blood Demon below, he felt a sense of unreality.

These two were both extremely powerful. The Blood Demon was nearly immortal, having his body shattered multiple times in a short span, each time regenerating flawlessly.

Di Mo’s strength was unmatched. Rampaging through crowds, killing with ruthless savagery.

Qiu Yimeng watched for a while and shook her head slowly: “Two alone aren’t enough.”

Indeed, though formidable, two fists cannot defeat four hands. A fierce tiger cannot withstand a pack of wolves. Yang Kang’s estate was not lacking in experts.

Apparently, they had discovered the Blood Demon’s weakness.

His rapid regeneration came solely from the blood sea!

Several martial artists whose cultivation methods merged ice and fire were fiercely freezing and scorching the blood sea. As its area shrank, the Blood Demon’s movements began to falter.

Di Mo noticed this, snorted coldly, and waved his hand to summon the Blood Demon back.

“It’s our turn!” Qiu Yimeng took a deep breath and said grimly.

Yang Kang’s forces were utterly disordered, the opportunity to dismantle his faction had opened. Now was the time to gnaw away at his power.

“I’ve been waiting a long time.” Huo Xingchen grinned and charged straight downward without hesitation. He targeted Gao Rangfeng immediately. “Brother Gao, a duel?”

Gao Rangfeng’s face darkened: “Brother Huo, do you think you can contend with me?”

Though they had never fought, Gao Rangfeng was certain that a playboy like Huo Xingchen was no match for him.

“Whether I can or not can only be seen in battle.” Huo Xingchen smiled faintly, slipping a folded fan into his collar, his expression growing cold.

“As you wish,” Gao Rangfeng snorted.

The two nobles of Zhongdu clashed instantly. Four Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage experts that accompanied them also confronted each other fiercely.

Elsewhere, while dodging Di Mo’s attack range, Lü Song caught Dong Qinghan’s attention.

Previously, at Po Jing Lake, they had fought over a treasure. Lü Song had given Dong Qinghan many headaches, nearly losing a Heaven-Grade Upper-Level Divine Soul Secret Treasure. Dong Qinghan still seethed with anger.

But back then, the bigger picture mattered, and Dong Fatty did not insist on continuing the dispute.

Now it was their turn to strike. Dong Qinghan naturally wanted to settle old scores and drive this tactless Lü Family Young Master out of War City!

The Hu sisters and Guan Chile charged forward too, the twin sisters emanating a faint aura that seemed to bind their life and True Yuan together. Though they were only at the Eighth Stage of the True Yuan Realm, their aura rivaled that of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Qiu Yimeng, observing silently, was impressed. No doubt these twins were far from mediocre.

Fan Hong of Ziwei Valley and Zuo Fang of Wen Xin Palace led their own teams to seek out enemies.

The five experts of the Duanmu Family, long restless, now unleashed their full aura, charging wherever enemy numbers gathered. This battle was their chance for revenge!

“Miss Qiu, I will stay to ensure your safety.” Liu Feisheng said softly, full of tenderness. During their time in Yang Kai’s estate, Liu Feisheng had become Qiu Yimeng’s bodyguard, never leaving her side.

Everyone could tell he was infatuated with Qiu Yimeng.

Though the young lady had hinted many times, Liu Feisheng ignored the coldness and continued his pursuit. As a supporter of Yang Kai, Qiu Yimeng couldn’t be too harsh and simply tolerated him.

Still, she avoided being alone with him whenever possible.

“No need, Xiaoman accompanies me well enough.” Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly, politely declining Liu’s kindness.

“Very well.” Liu Feisheng hesitated but agreed and went to join the Tianyuan City forces.

Only Qiu Yimeng, Luo Xiaoman, and the helpless Blood Servant Xiao Shun remained suspended in midair, powerless to intervene.

Without Yang Kai’s presence, neither Xiao Shun nor Ying Jiu could make a difference. Even if enemies attacked Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, they could only watch helplessly.

After all, Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman were not the ones they followed — Yang Kai was.

With Di Mo and the puppet Blood Demon wreaking havoc, the martial artists of Yang Kang’s estate were in utter chaos. When Dong Qinghan’s group charged, their enemies could only fight individually.

This was exactly what Qiu Yimeng wanted to see!

The enemy was numerous and strong. Without disrupting their rhythm, launching an effective offensive would be difficult. If scattered, Qiu Yimeng was confident her side was no weaker than any faction.

The spirit pills produced daily in the pill workshop were not wasted! Even Qiu Yimeng felt her cultivation advancing rapidly, despite her busy schedule leaving little time for actual cultivation, let alone the others.
