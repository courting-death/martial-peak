## Chapter 781 — Death Arena

The Death Arena was the defining feature of Sand City; many lords of the Demon Domain brought warriors they had trained or captured and forced them into life-or-death battles in the arena, profiting from the carnage.

There were no real restrictions—any demon could enter or participate.

For the naturally cruel demons, it was irresistible: they could watch the land run with blood and, while reveling in the spectacle, place bets on the outcome. Because of this the Death Arena was always booming, and Sand City amassed a great deal of wealth and resources each year.

Of the Four Great Demon Generals, Xueli was unquestionably the wealthiest; there was no argument about it.

Yu Mo briefly explained the situation in the Death Arena to Yang Kai, then left without further delay.

The night passed with no incidents; Yang Kai conserved his strength.

At noon the next day Yu Mo returned and led Yang Kai out.

They departed the palace that rose a hundred zhang above the ground and flew toward a district of Sand City; after a short while a vast circular arena came into view.

The arena occupied a considerable area, ringed with intricate seals and barriers; tiers of high stands surrounded it, already filled to overflowing with countless demons seated to watch the fights.

The two combatants on the field did not seem especially powerful, yet their fight was brutal—both were stained with blood, missing limbs, staring at one another with hatred while repeatedly unleashing Secret Treasures and Martial Skills, dyeing the sand in blood.

As the battle reached its climax, waves of cheers rolled from the stands.

Yang Kai glanced over casually, his expression indifferent.

Yu Mo shot him a look and sneered, “You’ll be fighting here soon. Your opponent matches your cultivation, but he can fight at full strength while you can only use half your power. Be careful—whether you live or die matters little to me, but the lord expects you to bring her some profit.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai said coolly, nodding once.

As they arrived, a chill gaze fell from one of the stands; Yang Kai looked up and saw Xueli seated there, An Ling’er attending her.

Their eyes met; An Ling’er covered her mouth and seemed to call out to Yang Kai, but Xueli immediately shot her a glare.

An Ling’er instantly fell silent. Yang Kai gave her a slow shake of his head, signaling her not to get excited.

Flying above the arena, Yu Mo led Yang Kai into an underground passage; they walked a long way before a faint light appeared ahead.

Beyond that passage lay the inner area of the Death Arena.

Xueli’s subordinates were already waiting there; upon seeing Yu Mo they all greeted him with respectful bows.

“Lord Yu Mo, is this the human boy who will fight this time?” asked a sallow-faced man.

“Yes. The files have been submitted and the odds have been set,” Yu Mo answered with a slight nod.

The sallow-faced man grinned viciously as he sized up Yang Kai and hissed, “Kid, keep your eyes open—your opponent’s no joke. He’s fought three times and won all three; among fighters of the same rank, no one lasts past the time of a single incense stick against him. Don’t make a fool of yourself.”

“Let’s see if he can last an incense stick,” Yang Kai replied, his tone flat and unflustered.

The sallow-faced man was taken aback. “Where did this human brat come from, so arrogant? I want to see how you kill him within an incense stick!”

Yu Mo glanced at Yang Kai with a sidelong look and snorted. Though he had tested Yang Kai and knew he was not ordinary, with his current restriction allowing only half his strength surviving would be fortunate; such brash talk was presumptuous.

Yang Kai remained silent and waited.

In the Death Arena the fight between the two combatants had already ended: one was torn to pieces, the other left maimed. Men immediately went forward to clear the field. The maimed survivor, though still alive, was barely clinging to life. Those attending the cleanup, seeing this, called up to the high platform to ask how to proceed; after receiving orders they turned and directly put the victor to death.

The sand was stained with blood, yet cheers rose from the stands.

After a while Yu Mo nodded to Yang Kai and said, “It’s your turn. Remember what the lord said yesterday.”

Yang Kai’s face remained impassive as he donned the mask Yu Mo had prepared and strode forward.

From the opposite corridor a man emerged—broad of shoulder and heavy-featured, shirtless, every sinew swelling with explosive power; he was easily twice Yang Kai’s size.

As he approached, a murderous qi swept over like a torrential gale, as though it would rip Yang Kai apart.

Yang Kai stood unmoving like an ancient reef; when that murderous qi reached him it divided and flowed past to either side.

Many in the stands showed intrigued expressions, convinced this duel would be thrilling. An Ling’er standing beside Xueli clenched her fist, watching with nervous intensity.

After a moment they stopped about ten zhang apart and stared at one another.

The hulking man appeared to be human; why he had been brought into the Demon Domain was unclear. As Yu Mo had explained, most fighters in the Death Arena were captured like Yang Kai and forced to fight to survive; some voluntarily pledged themselves to the demons for profit and status, while others were trained by the lords themselves.

No matter the reason they entered the arena, the ultimate goal was the same—kill the enemy.

“Kid, hiding your face and afraid to show who you are? Heh—kneel and kowtow three times to your grandpa and I’ll spare your life. How about that!” the hulking man barked like thunder.

That roar carried intimidation and subtly hid a Divine Sense attack; if it struck, a fighter’s will to fight would crumble, leaving him defenseless as the hulking man finished him.

Such tricks did not work on Yang Kai. He showed little reaction, merely watching the man while slowly shifting his stance and stirring his True Yuan to test his state.

Thanks to Yu Mo, Yang Kai’s True Yuan circulation had been severely dampened and his reactions far slower; unless the restriction was lifted he could not display his peak prowess.

Still, it should be barely enough to handle the hulking man.

“Are you deaf?” the hulking man roared again when he received no reply.

Yang Kai’s silhouette flickered, and a hidden killing intent struck from the side. A cold light crossed the hulking man’s brow; a smile curled his lips—he made no move to dodge.

Boom...

A muffled sound came as Yang Kai’s strike landed on the man’s ribs, but the opponent did not budge; his body was like an iron plate, and the rebound sent pain and numbness up Yang Kai’s arm.

The man’s strength was indeed considerable. Yang Kai realized that to have three straight victories in the arena, this fighter’s combat experience and innate ability had to surpass ordinary men.

The strike had no effect. Before Yang Kai could withdraw, the hulking man grinned silently. At some unknown moment, one of his hands had already been raised high in a knife hand, True Yuan gathered to the fullest, and it came slashing down with ferocious force.

True Yuan swelled and in midair took the shape of a gigantic hammer.

Before the attack landed the ground of the Death Arena had already caved inward, a sign of the blow’s terrifying power.

Yang Kai’s expression flickered; he seemed clumsy and failed to retract his hand in time.

In the next instant the palm-knife struck Yang Kai’s arm.

With a crisp, decisive crack Yang Kai’s arm snapped on the spot, hanging limp and powerless. Only then did he manage to stagger back, finally pulling open some distance between himself and the burly man.

Hisses echoed from the stands.

The demons who had expected something special from the masked fighter were bitterly disappointed to see him dismembered after a single exchange.

“Ah!”

An Ling’er gave a delicate cry, worry flashing in her beautiful eyes.

Xueli narrowed her phoenix-like eyes as she gazed down at Yang Kai and pursed her lips into a faint smile.

The moment Yang Kai steadied himself after losing an arm, the hulking man darted forward like lightning. Black arcs of energy danced across his thick arms, making them grotesque and terrifying.

His massive frame exuded a bloody, brutal aura; a chill flashed through his palms, his momentum fierce and threatening.

Two basin-sized spheres of black, lightning-like energy appeared in his hands, radiating murderous intent.

With a sweep of both hands he trapped Yang Kai within them.

The electric glow surged.

He intended to finish Yang Kai with that strike.

Yang Kai had no strength to resist. Under the onslaught of the black light he evaded and twisted but could not escape; countless palm marks scarred his body and blood spewed forth—he looked pitiful.

The hisses from the stands grew louder.

They wanted to witness a fierce, stirring battle—not this one-sided slaughter.

Yang Kai’s performance drew their contempt. Those who had placed hopeful bets on him cursed him in the vilest terms.

Even Xueli’s brows twitched; her face hardened into a cold expression.

She wondered if Yang Kai’s earlier performance had been a fluke and whether his true ability was mediocre—if so, how could he be so easily undone by a peer?

If he could not withstand such attacks, survival would be impossible.

“Another useless one,” Xueli snorted inwardly, her interest in Yang Kai waning.
