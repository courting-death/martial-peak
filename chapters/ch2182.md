## Chapter 2182 — Zhuang Bufan

Although Yang Kai’s actions would certainly offend quite a few people, he hadn’t gone too far—he hadn’t killed anyone recklessly, nor had he truly robbed them, so the matter wasn’t all that serious.

If he really had stolen from everyone he encountered, then he’d be finished. As soon as he left Four Seasons Land, he’d become the target of every major sect…

At that point, unless he joined Qingyang Shrine or Gao Xueting was willing to shelter him, he’d inevitably be hunted down by the experts of those sects for retribution.

But by handling things as he had, he ensured he wouldn’t make mortal enemies, while still reaping rewards.

Two days later, Yang Kai had already gathered two of the three missing medicinal ingredients—only the last one remained unfound.

According to his observations, the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus would fully mature in at most a day. If he still couldn’t find that final auxiliary herb by then, he’d have no choice but to consume it as is.

And at this moment, only two days remained before the exit to Four Seasons Land would close!

Yang Kai was feeling rather anxious!

Because if his guess was right, those true experts should also be rushing toward the exit by now—they’d probably arrive here soon.

Just as he was thinking this, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed. He focused his attention in one direction, and after a moment, pursed his lips in dissatisfaction: “So they’re here already… Seems a bit early!”

In the distant sky, a dazzling streak of light was speeding toward him. Within the light, several auras mingled—it was clearly more than one person. Among them, one in particular gave Yang Kai an extraordinary feeling, seeming much stronger than the rest.

This person was clearly one of those Dao Origin Realm experts whom Yang Kai had to take seriously.

But since they hadn’t come close yet, Yang Kai didn’t know who it was.

As he observed, the light approached the mountain peak and soon halted before Yang Kai. The radiance faded, revealing several figures.

As soon as they appeared, a man of about thirty pointed at Yang Kai and shouted, “Senior Brother Zhuang, it’s this bastard! He robbed me and Junior Sister Xu earlier—he took our Spatial Rings!”

As he spoke, a beautiful, fair-skinned woman in the group nodded beside him, glaring at Yang Kai with deep hatred, as if they had some great enmity.

Yang Kai looked closely and realized that both the man and the woman seemed familiar—they were the ones he’d met just yesterday…

But like everyone else who’d come here, these two had been subdued by Yang Kai’s extraordinary methods, and he’d taken their Spatial Rings to inspect them.

“Oh? So you two are from Wuhua Hall… My apologies!” Yang Kai said with a smile, cupping his fists at the man.

He hadn’t bothered to ask about their backgrounds before, but now that he saw them with Zhuang Bufan, it was clear.

Wuhua Hall was, after all, one of the top sects in the Southern Territory. As elite disciples of Wuhua Hall, they were naturally proud—being robbed like that was a humiliation they couldn’t swallow. No doubt, after leaving yesterday, they’d tried to contact Senior Brother Zhuang Bufan to help them get even.

Of course, the most important thing was the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus! Bringing Zhuang Bufan here could not only suppress Yang Kai’s arrogance, but maybe even let them seize this Spiritual Medicine.

“Pah!” The man spat in Yang Kai’s direction and snorted coldly, “Brat, cut the act. If you admit your mistake now, kneel and kowtow a few times, and slap yourself, Senior Brother Zhuang might just forgive you. He’s always been righteous and never kills the innocent. But if you try to resist… hmph!”

The meaning in his words was obvious. Compared to his submissiveness after being intimidated by Yang Kai yesterday, he was now arrogant to the extreme, emboldened by having someone backing him up.

“Friend, I don’t understand what you’re saying,” Yang Kai replied casually.

“Don’t play dumb!” the man shouted angrily. “You know exactly what you did!”

“Heh…” Yang Kai chuckled, turning his gaze to Zhuang Bufan. “Brother Zhuang, what do you say?”

Since arriving, Zhuang Bufan hadn’t spoken, his gaze shifting between the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus and Yang Kai, his expression growing more and more puzzled.

He was confused for two reasons…

First, the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus. As Wuhua Hall’s chief Dao Origin Realm expert, his experience was extraordinary. He could vaguely sense the lotus’s mystery and quality, but wasn’t entirely sure, so he was suspicious.

Second, it was Yang Kai. No matter how he observed, Yang Kai only seemed to have the cultivation of the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm! For someone at that level to easily subdue his Junior Brother and Junior Sister—if they hadn’t insisted it was true, he wouldn’t have believed it.

Now, hearing Yang Kai’s question, Zhuang Bufan frowned and cupped his fists. “May I ask how to address you?”

Although he’d come to avenge his Junior Brother and Junior Sister, he still acted polite and didn’t rush to attack Yang Kai, showing his good character.

“Yang Kai!” Yang Kai replied, cupping his fists in return.

“I recall… Brother Yang, you came here with people from Qingyang Shrine, didn’t you?” Zhuang Bufan’s confusion deepened. “But… why have I never heard of a Brother Yang from Qingyang Shrine?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai raised his brows and praised, "Brother Zhuang, you have a sharp eye and a good memory! I did indeed come with people from Qingyang Shrine."

He was the first to recall that Yang Kai had arrived with the Qingyang Shrine group. Back in the nameless valley, there were hundreds of people—being able to remember Yang Kai’s movements in such a crowd was impressive.

"The reason you don’t know me is because I’m not a disciple of Qingyang Shrine. I just happened to be traveling with Elder Gao for certain reasons."

“I see!” Zhuang Bufan nodded slightly, not asking further. In his view, Yang Kai probably had some connection with a high-ranking member of Qingyang Shrine, which was why he could accompany Gao Xueting into the nameless valley and enter Four Seasons Land.

He pondered for a moment, then said slowly, “Originally… my Junior Brother and Junior Sister suffered a loss at your hands because their skills were lacking. It’s not your fault, and I shouldn’t have come here acting all righteous. I hope you’ll forgive me for that!”

He didn’t look down on Yang Kai for his low cultivation. Instead, he deliberately explained, his words tinged with a hint of disappointment, making the man and woman blush with embarrassment.

“I understand!” Yang Kai laughed, feeling that Zhuang Bufan was a decent person…

“But, as a Senior Brother, I must act like one!” Zhuang Bufan’s tone suddenly changed, his face turning solemn. “If my Junior Brother and Junior Sister ask for help, I can’t just ignore them. A Senior Brother must protect his juniors…”

At these words, the people around him looked moved, gazing at his back as if he were a mountain shielding them from the storm, feeling safe.

“Brother Yang, why don’t you suggest a solution? How should we resolve this?” Zhuang Bufan looked calmly at Yang Kai.

He didn’t seem willing to bully the weak, so he handed the initiative to Yang Kai, his words full of confidence, as if he could handle whatever Yang Kai said.

Yang Kai grinned. “Brother Zhuang, you’ve probably heard the whole story?”

Zhuang Bufan nodded. “Yes! They explained it clearly—they said you subdued them and then robbed them!”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brows. “I won’t deny subduing them. But as for robbing… I can’t agree with that!”

“What’s this?” Zhuang Bufan frowned, displeased. “You won’t admit to what you’ve done?”

“It’s not that I won’t admit it, but how can I admit to something I didn’t do? That’s just slandering me.” Yang Kai looked aggrieved, glancing at the man and woman. “You say I robbed you—then tell me, what did you lose?”

“Uh…” The man was speechless.

He really hadn’t lost anything. Yang Kai had only taken their Spatial Rings to check them, then returned them. He hadn’t explained this to Zhuang Bufan…

Seeing his expression, Yang Kai immediately understood and laughed. “Brother Zhuang, it seems you don’t know the whole story.”

Zhuang Bufan’s face darkened slightly as he turned to the man. “What’s going on?”

The man stammered, his eyes darting, not knowing how to explain.

Zhuang Bufan looked at the woman. “Junior Sister Xu, did you lose anything?”

The woman bit her red lip and shook her head. “No, nothing was lost…”

“That’s it!” Yang Kai interrupted her, looking at Zhuang Bufan. “They didn’t lose anything, so how can it be called robbery? As for fighting… well, martial artists cultivate—how could there not be some conflict? Just because they’re from Wuhua Hall, I can’t touch them? Besides, I had my reasons for fighting them.” Yang Kai’s voice turned cold and stern. “And the reason was that Spiritual Medicine behind me.”

“I see,” Zhuang Bufan, being clever, immediately grasped the key point.

“Exactly!” Yang Kai said seriously. “With your insight, Brother Zhuang, you can probably tell that this Spiritual Medicine isn’t mature yet. Picking it prematurely would ruin its properties, so I’ve been guarding it to prevent anyone from wasting it. These past days, I’ve sent quite a few people away. Yesterday, when your Junior Brother and Junior Sister came…”

"No need to say more; I can guess the rest." Zhuang Bufan nodded slightly.

It was nothing more than these two from Wuhua Hall seeing the value of the Spiritual Medicine and, thinking Yang Kai’s cultivation was low, trying to drive him away—only to end up suffering a setback. Unable to accept it, they’d gone to find Zhuang Bufan to help them get even…
