## Chapter 1142 — Sick Brain

Outside the cave at Dragon Lair Mountain, two Origin Returning Realm experts casually poured out their Saint Yuan and attacked that patch of open ground, constantly wearing down the formation laid by Yang Flame.

Wu Yi clenched her fists nervously and said in a trembling voice, "Yang Flame, hurry and deal with them."

The last time it had been Yang Flame who presided over the formation, assisting Yang Kai in killing the Xu Family's Saint King Realm experts, and in the end not a single person from the Xu Family escaped. Wu Yi had thought Yang Flame might do the same again.

Yang Flame shook her head and said, "If they enter the formation I am confident I can keep them from getting out, but they won't go in, and I can't do anything."

That was the flaw of formations: though powerful and unfathomable, if others are careful and refuse to enter the formation's range, then however strong the formation is, it becomes powerless.

"Then what do we do?" Wu Yi panicked.

Yang Flame smiled faintly. "Don't worry, that formation is meant to be broken by others."

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise and immediately realized the formation over there was not as simple as it appeared; he was certain that if Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother managed to break the visible formation and pushed deeper, they would undoubtedly fall into even more fearsome formations.

Even the usually timid Yang Flame was at ease now; how could Yang Kai not see through the trick? Ridiculous that those two Origin Returning Realm masters were completely unaware, thinking that breaking those formations would be a great achievement.

Boom, boom, boom...

Hong Zhen's twelve flying knives and the other Origin Returning Realm expert's octagonal spiked hammer kept battering the formation, making it appear on the verge of collapse.

Xie Hongwen seemed to have grown tired of shouting; he stood over there waiting expectantly, his gaze lascivious as it swept across Yang Flame and Wu Yi, that obscene look making people extremely uncomfortable.

Ian, the Haike Family's Family Head, and several Guest Elders stood nearby, putting on servile smiles that made Wu Yi feel nauseous.

The formation here had yet to be broken when, a dozen or so li away, another group of people suddenly arrived.

"Eh? Why is there fighting over there?" the leader of that group, an Origin Returning Realm expert, called out in surprise; the commotion from Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother attacking the formation was loud enough that even ten or so li away others could hear.

A middle-aged man following him glanced toward the cave, secretly pleased but wearing a mournful expression as he pleaded, "Lord Luo, that brat acts wantonly; not long ago he slaughtered members of my Xu Family— from the family head down to the Young Master, over a dozen in total. My Xu Family has suffered grievous losses. I beg Lord Luo to see justice served and avenge my Xu Family."

Luo Qing nodded lightly. “I know. The Xu Family’s patriarch once did me a small favor back in the day. The reason I came along this time is to seek justice on his behalf. If that young man knows what’s good for him, I’ll let it go—but if he doesn’t, he’ll have to be taught a lesson.”

He enunciated the two words 'small favor' heavily, clearly reminding the other that help does not mean he would risk his life.

"Thank you, Lord Luo! Thank you, Lord Luo!" the group cried, repeatedly thanking Luo Qing under the middle-aged man's lead.

This group were warriors of the Xu Family; when news of their family head and Guest Elders being wiped out reached the Xu Family, they immediately realized their own strength would not be enough to avenge them and hurried to Tianyun City to seek help.

The middle-aged man Xu Zhibing was the cousin of Xu Zhikun, the Xu Family head, with only the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, while Luo Qing was the Origin Returning Realm expert they'd brought.

Xu Zhibing knew his own limitations; he understood he couldn't persuade the city lord Fei Zhi Tu to support his cause, and the facts proved him right. Even if Ian of the Haike Family personally brought gifts, Fei Zhi Tu had not taken his words seriously.

The city lord had no interest in petty grudges between small families; even if Ian had bumped into Xie Hongwen, he would still be waiting for news at the city lord's mansion.

Xu Zhibing did not go to the city lord's mansion but went straight to find Luo Qing, because Xu Zhikun had once helped Luo Qing a little, and for that reason Luo Qing would not stand idly by.

Sure enough, Xu Zhibing brought Luo Qing over with murderous intent to Dragon Lair Mountain, but before they reached the cave they heard the sounds of fighting.

The group quickened their pace and soon arrived at the cave entrance. Luo Qing gave a light "ah" and quickly walked up to Xie Hongwen to bow, "Greetings, Young Master Xie."

Xie Hongwen, who was urging Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother to hurry and break the formation, glanced at Luo Qing and sneered, "Aren't you that guard from Jubao Tower? Shouldn't you be guarding Jubao Tower instead of running here?"

Luo Qing hurriedly replied, "Young Master Xie, I had some dealings with the Xu Family head who died here; I was entrusted and came to seek the killer and demand an explanation."

Xie Hongwen scoffed, "Also here to stick up for others? Fine, you came at the right time. You can join in—help Hong Zhen and the others smash that broken formation. Smash it and there will be rewards. Those two trash are useless; they've been at it half a day over such a formation."

Although Luo Qing served as a guard at Jubao Tower, he was ultimately from Yingyue Hall and dared not defy Xie Hongwen's orders; he nodded, "I dare not disobey Young Master Xie."

Saying that, Luo Qing produced his Secret Treasure and quickly advanced, preparing to team up with Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother to attack the formation.

On the other side, Ian cheerfully greeted Xu Zhibing for bringing an Origin Returning Realm expert. Xu Zhibing exchanged a few polite words and wondered why the Haike Family had arrived earlier to hire an expert to deal with Yang Kai; though puzzled he did not press the matter. The Xu Family was no longer what it once was, and under the suppression of Yingyue Hall the Haike Family would not openly annex them, but occupying some of their territory or demanding benefits was possible. Facing such a neighbor, Xu Zhibing could only show humility and play for survival, hoping Ian would not be too ruthless.

Ian was naturally delighted; although he had felt uneasy before, now that Xu Zhibing had brought an Origin Returning Realm expert, killing Yang Kai was a foregone conclusion.

Wiping out Yang Kai this time would satisfy Xie Hongwen's lecherous desires and set the Haike Family on the path to prosperity. If Xie Hongwen could take Wu Yi away, with her pulling strings the Haike Family's status would rise and gaining entry into Yingyue Hall would not be a dream—only hoping Xie Hongwen would not, in a fit of anger, kill Wu Yi.

While indulging in such fantasies, Hong Zhen suddenly barked angrily, "What are you doing?"

At his roar, everyone turned and saw an extremely strange scene.

The Origin Returning Realm expert Luo Qing, whom Xu Zhibing had brought, was staring blankly at the cave entrance, holding his Secret Treasure but not channeling Saint Yuan into it; from his manner it seemed he had not attacked the formation blocking them at all.

Hong Zhen's Senior Brother likewise wore a displeased look and scolded, "If you won't help then step aside; the two of us are enough. This formation will soon be breached—one more or less makes no difference!"

Earlier Xie Hongwen's belittling words had angered Hong Zhen and his companion; now that the formation was on the verge of collapse, they naturally did not want to share the credit with Luo Qing.

"Wait, wait!" Luo Qing seemed to have discovered something grave, a flicker of dread crossing his eyes as he hurriedly stopped the two from continuing their attack.

"Luo Qing, don't take advantage of my kindness—what do you think you're doing?" Hong Zhen roared.

Xie Hongwen's face darkened, "What's going on?"

"Young Master, this guy not only refuses to help but is actually obstructing us—he's brain-sick!" Hong Zhen immediately said, "I suspect he's in league with that youth."

"Is that so?" Xie Hongwen looked coldly at Luo Qing.

"No, Young Master Xie, please listen to my explanation," Luo Qing cried out in alarm, waving his hand, then moved close to Xie Hongwen and whispered a few words in his ear.

No one knew what he had said; Xie Hongwen's face suddenly changed and he urgently asked, "Really?"

"Absolutely," Luo Qing nodded heavily and said in a low voice, "Young Master Xie, calm down, I'll notify Elder Qian at once."

Without waiting for Xie Hongwen's reaction, he immediately produced his communication compass Secret Treasure and poured his Divine Sense into it.

"Bastard!" Xie Hongwen snatched Luo Qing's communication Secret Treasure and smashed it to the ground, glaring at Luo Qing with a sinister look before casting a dark glance at Yang Kai; his expression turned as black as thunder.

Hong Zhen and the other Origin Returning Realm expert, not knowing what had happened, exchanged bewildered looks and halted their attack.

"What are they doing?" Yang Flame looked over anxiously. "I was waiting for them to break the formation."

"Seems a disagreement has arisen." Yang Kai couldn't make sense of it either; he only knew Luo Qing had kept staring at him with a look of recognition, but Yang Kai was certain he'd never met this man nor had any dealings with him.

Yang Kai's memory had always been good; if he had truly met that man before, he would have remembered.

The sudden development not only puzzled Yang Kai and the others, but also baffled Ian. The vague sense of crisis in his heart intensified; he glanced cautiously at Xie Hongwen and noticed the notorious Young Master of Tianyun City wore a look of inward torment, as if struggling over some difficult choice.

Ian felt a chill in his heart, thinking could it be that Yang Kai was someone of great backing? Otherwise why would Xie Hongwen hesitate? With Xie Hongwen's temper, he normally would not let it go, but this youth didn't seem to have any powerful patron.

Ian felt unsettled and nervous.

But soon Xie Hongwen made a decision; with a ruthless look he shouted toward Hong Zhen, "Why are you stopping—did I tell you to stop? Keep hitting!"

"Yes!" Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother responded and once again launched their attack on the formation.

"No, Young Master Xie!" Luo Qing was terrified and cried out to stop them once more.
