## Chapter 2054 — Ghost-Hand Shentu

At a certain moment, a strange sound came from within the Ink Jade Cauldron, and with that sound a thick medicinal fragrance immediately spread out.

That wisp of fragrance drifted into Yang Kai's nose and body, unexpectedly loosening the Martial Dao bottleneck at its critical point, and the Origin Qi that had been calm began to circulate wildly.

Yang Kai abruptly opened his eyes, reached out and slapped the Ink Jade Cauldron; the lid flew up instantly.

At once he performed the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Technique he had comprehended from the Great Dao Pill Tone; seals flashed and shifted on his hands, and successive streams of force poured into the Ink Jade Cauldron.

In a short while the noises inside the cauldron grew clearer; there was even the sound of something rumbling within.

After a while, as Yang Kai altered the pill-gathering formation, strands of light suddenly shot forth from the Ink Jade Cauldron.

Yang Kai had long been awaiting this moment; seeing it, he did not hesitate — he reached out and caught those several streams of light together in the palm of his hand.

He had no time to scrutinize the final result of this pill refinement; he only knew that six pills had been produced.

Placing the six newly refined Dao Origin Pills into the jade vial he had prepared, Yang Kai waved his hand, and the large number of Source Crystals stored in his Spatial Ring poured out with a clatter, forming a ring around him.

Some time earlier Yang Kai had slain many powerful foes and obtained no fewer than ten million Source Crystals from them, yet in this moment, for the sake of his own ascension, he cast out all ten million Source Crystals.

After all, the Spiritual Qi here was not particularly concentrated; to guarantee the requirements for his ascension, he had to rely on Source Crystals.

No sooner had the Source Crystals appeared than a muffled thunder-like sound came from above Yang Kai's head; the Spiritual Qi suddenly churned, and the Power of the Laws swirled and danced around.

In no time at all, a vast patch of black clouds formed above Yang Kai's head, slowly rotating and gradually assuming the shape of a funnel.

Sand and stones flew about all around, and the sun and moon dimmed.

As if drawn by some mysterious force, the Source Crystals he had scattered around burst open at that moment; with crackling explosions they turned into streams of pure energy, spreading outward and converging into the sky.

The black funnel vortex above Yang Kai's head swelled at a speed visible to the naked eye, its force terrifying to the extreme.

The surrounding Spiritual Qi, which had originally been meager, became incomparably dense from the replenishment of so many Source Crystals. The place where Yang Kai stood was soon shrouded in a white mist — not ordinary fog, but a phenomenon formed when Spiritual Qi became overly concentrated.

Yang Kai seemed utterly unaware of this; he still sat cross-legged on the ground with his eyes closed, his expression calm and composed.

He communed with his Void Mind Crystal through his consciousness, meditating on the Martial Dao, and the Dark Star's Stellar Origin within him seemed likewise tugged by some unseen force, beating in a measured rhythm; with that Stellar Origin's blessing, Yang Kai could perceive the surrounding Power of the Laws far more clearly.

At the Third Stage of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, the many fragmented remnants of the Power of the Laws he had absorbed were, in that moment, consummately refined and elevated, corroborating his own revelations and propelling his cultivation to a higher plane.

Time slowly passed, and the black funnel in the sky grew ever more immense, almost blotting out the whole sky.

Although Yang Kai had deliberately chosen a desolate place for his ascension and had even spent several days beforehand clearing the demonic beasts within a thousand li, accidents still occurred.

The commotion his ascension created was so great that even those thousands of li away could see it.

When that black funnel, which obscured nearly half the sky, took shape, many warriors who had been watching from afar saw the spectacle; naturally curious, they hurried toward Yang Kai's ascension site to see what was happening.

Once those warriors understood someone was about to break through to a Realm and undergo the Heaven-and-Earth Energy baptism, most of them stopped short and watched from hundreds of li away.

These fighters were not particularly strong; after all, the martial artists near Fenglin City were generally unimpressive — most were of the Void King Realm or the Origin Returning Realm, and some were even weaker.

Sensing how violent the force gathering in the sky was, who dared approach? They treated it as mere entertainment, gathering together to point in the direction where Yang Kai was and gossip.

Among the crowd was a slight girl in purple of about twenty; her cultivation was only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and she seemed afflicted by a chronic ailment — though it was not cold she wore many layers. Several Void King Realm warriors guarded her; the girl's beautiful eyes stared into the distance for a while before she suddenly coughed lightly.

The Void King Realm warriors beside her, hearing the sound, looked at her with concern, but they seemed accustomed to such things and were not overly alarmed; after the girl's breathing steadied they withdrew their gazes.

A moment later, a First Stage of the Void King Realm warrior hurried back from afar, and in a few blinks arrived before the girl.

"Miss, I'm back," the warrior said in a low voice.

"Did you learn anything? Who is ascending?" the girl asked softly.

The warrior shook his head. "I failed to fulfill your request. The Heaven-and-Earth Energy there is too violent, and the person is at a critical moment of ascension; I dared not get too close, so I couldn't see what he looks like. From my observation, that person should be breaking through to the Dao Origin Realm!"

"Indeed breaking through to the Dao Origin Realm!" the purple-clad girl seemed to have expected it, nodding slightly as her eyes brightened. "If this person chose such a place to break through, it means he has no relatives and no Sect background — clearly a lone expert, someone we could try to recruit!"

The Void King Realm followers around the purple-clad girl all nodded slightly in agreement.

If he had a Sect background or relatives, who would willingly risk breaking through such a major gate in this barren wilderness? Only a lone wanderer pushed to extremes would do such a thing.

"That may be so, but, miss, forgive my frankness — this person might not succeed in breaking through," another dignified middle-aged man said gravely as he looked toward the scene.

"Why do you say that?" the purple-clad girl asked, turning her gaze to him.

The middle-aged man smiled bitterly. "The commotion he caused is truly enormous; this is not something even a top Void King Realm warrior could withstand. To speak plainly, if he cannot endure this Heaven-and-Earth Energy baptism, there is no hope of his surviving — he will surely die!"

The other Void King Realm warriors nodded repeatedly, staring at the huge black funnel in the sky with looks of apprehension; obviously, if they had to endure such an energy baptism, there would be no chance of success.

The purple-clad girl frowned. "So his chances are slim?"

The middle-aged man said, "This is only my opinion. If he truly has even a one-in-ten-thousand chance to survive this tribulation and pass this gate, his future achievements would likely be beyond our imagining."

The purple-clad girl nodded, pondered for a moment, then said, "In any case, let's at least stand guard for him. If he truly manages to ascend, he will surely remember those who helped him — then we can try to draw him to our side. The Qin Family's talents have withered; it's down to our old ancestor alone to hold things up, our fortunes in decline. If we could win this man to our cause, the Qin Family could finally catch its breath."

The Void King Realm warriors all nodded in unison. "Since miss says so, we shall follow her orders."

As the group prepared to disperse and guard Yang Kai's ascension, the middle-aged man's brow suddenly furrowed; he glared in a certain direction and barked, "Bad — someone is going to interfere with him!"

"Who?" the purple-clad girl cried, startled. She followed the middle-aged man's gaze and indeed saw a cluster of lights streaking toward Yang Kai's ascension site. They made no effort to hide their forms or conceal their intentions; each figure radiated a fierce, hostile aura.

Within that patch of light figures were prominent; roughly counted, there were at least a dozen, and the one at the head shone especially brightly.

The purple-clad girl hesitated a moment, stamped her foot and said, "Follow me — let's see if we can negotiate!"

With that she flicked her delicate form and flew toward them.

The middle-aged man was alarmed and hurried after her with the others.

Not far off, among the group charging toward Yang Kai, someone soon noticed the Qin Family's movement and shouted forward, "Master, someone is coming toward us."

At the very front a short, plump old man with nearly all his hair gone halted; his triangular eyes swept around and fixed on the Qin Family group, and he snorted coldly, "A few Void King Realm brats dare to come and ruin my business — they've got nerve."

"Master, shall we deal with them as well..." the speaker said, making a throat-slitting gesture.

The old man sneered. "Let's wait and see. Since they dare come, they must be relying on something. I want to see what their backing truly is."

"Master, your insight is right!" the man flattered.

Before long, the Qin Family group under the purple-clad girl's lead arrived not far in front of the old man and his companions.

After that rush, the purple-clad girl seemed greatly spent; she coughed violently and could not speak.

The middle-aged men who had rushed to her side formed a protective ring around her; upon seeing the short, fat old man and his trademark bald head, the middle-aged man's face changed drastically and, as if facing a great foe, he shouted in alarm, "Ghost-Hand Shentu!"
