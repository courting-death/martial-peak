## Chapter 493 — I Do Not Understand

“They are helping me instead. I should thank Third Brother for sending five experts over,” Yang Kai smiled faintly. On the first night of the succession war, Yang Kai had captured Yang Tie but did not use him as leverage to exchange for supplies from the Xiang Family. Instead, he let him off, and Yang Tie reciprocated by having five masters from the Duanmu Family follow him over, which was somewhat unexpected.

However, over the past few days and several battles, these five Duanmu Family experts had truly contributed much. After all, they were all Divine Roaming Realm cultivators, among whom one had reached the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, playing a considerable role.

Yang Tie nodded slightly, his expression suddenly growing grave as he spoke in a low voice, “When you go to the Elder Hall, you must not show hesitation or weakness, or else... you will suffer losses.”

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned and about to ask more, but Yang Tie had already turned and left in haste, not even giving him a chance to speak.

Does Third Brother know something? Yang Kai pondered.

Though Yang Tie’s personal strength was mediocre and his performance in the succession war was unsatisfactory, his father held some influence within the Yang Family.

Compared to Fourth Master Yang, Yang Tie’s father’s status was undoubtedly much higher and he could access some of the Yang Family's secrets.

Could Third Brother have heard something from his father? Yang Kai furrowed his brow, carefully considering Third Brother’s words, his expression calm.

Since he was summoned, he accepted it calmly. The reason the Elder Hall called for him would soon be clear.

He smiled and strode toward the Elder Hall.

This was Yang Kai’s third visit to the Elder Hall. The first time was concerning the Golden Feather Eagle, the second time because of the Blood Servants. Each time, he found the white-haired elders of the Yang Family seemingly idle and about to pass away.

But this time was different.

Leading Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian, Yang Kai stepped into the Elder Hall and was astonished to see more than a dozen elders seated within.

They were arranged in two rows, each one imposing without raising their voice, their expressions indifferent.

Sitting at the very top and head of the hall was Yang Zhen, who had dealt with Yang Kai several times before. His demeanor was no different.

They seemed to be waiting for him.

This formation... looked somewhat like a tribunal. Yang Kai reckoned he had done nothing heinous in the succession war, so why would these elders assemble such a grand gathering?

Though suspicious in his heart, his face remained steady as he cupped his fist and respectfully said, “Yang Kai greets the elders!”

Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian bowed as well.

“You two, withdraw!” Yang Zhen waved them off. His eyes shone keenly as they flickered uncertainly on Ying Jiu.

He was like this, and the other elders were the same—each manifesting a trace of surprise and doubt on their faces.

Ying Jiu was weakened at his foundation and had been cursed with the Sealing Yuan Curse, yet now he not only returned with Yang Kai in good health but seemed even stronger than before. Naturally, the elders were concerned.

They had no idea why this was so.

Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian exchanged a glance and dared not disobey Yang Zhen’s order, bowing deeply before leaving.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, his expression turning amused.

Not only did the elders greet him with their utmost grand arrangement, but they also sent away the two Blood Servants he had brought, forcing him to face more than a dozen elders and their pressure alone.

Others would surely feel uneasy and lose some of their momentum. Whatever the elders said next would be taken for granted; no one would dare refute or argue.

A show of force?

What exactly did they intend?

After Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian left, the dozen or so elders quietly observed Yang Kai’s reaction and were all somewhat surprised to see his calm and composed demeanor unchanged.

They had never seen such boldness in a young man, not even Yang Wei.

“May I ask the elders what matter calls me back to the family?” Yang Kai ignored their probing gazes and spoke directly to Yang Zhen.

“To summon you back naturally means business,” Yang Zhen responded. Having presided over the Elder Hall for years handling the family’s affairs, he had long developed a cold and stern countenance that instilled fear in most.

“I ask you, by what means did you heal Ying Jiu’s injuries and break the Sealing Yuan Curse? Furthermore, I understand your Blood Servants often suffer injuries but recover within a day or two. What secrets are hidden behind this?” Yang Zhen’s voice was grave.

Yang Kai frowned. “Elders summoning me at such a critical time surely is not merely to ask about these trivial matters.”

Though his tone was even, anyone could hear the accusation in his words.

At this crucial juncture, encountering any Yang Family disciples involved in the succession war, if it were only to summon Yang Kai for such trivial issues, it would be overly pedantic.

These old elders at the Elder Hall were not so bored as to fuss over such minor things.

Yang Zhen cleared his throat and said solemnly, “Of course not!”

“Then is this question for the family or... the elders themselves?” Yang Kai inquired.

Yang Zhen was taken aback, seemingly not expecting Yang Kai’s calm and lucid mind with so many elders present, then shamelessly replied, “It is rather that I speak on behalf of the elders here. Everyone is very curious how you did it.”

“If not the family’s intention...” Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, “I am sorry, but I have nothing to disclose.”

The elders collectively shook their heads slowly, disappointment thick on their faces. Yang Zhen’s expression darkened.

They never imagined Yang Kai would dare refuse to answer their question, and the excuse was quite clever.

If it is not the family’s wish, then he need not answer. The old fellows could hardly impose their seniority to force him.

“Elder, I have many affairs. If you have something to say, speak plainly,” Yang Kai’s tone grew impatient. From the behavior of these elders since entering the hall, he could see many problems.

They wanted to make the first move and press him with their momentum, surely to say something detrimental to his interests. Otherwise, why host such a grand formation?

Since it concerned his interests, and reminded by Third Brother’s earlier words, Yang Kai saw no reason to be courteous.

“Very well, I will not beat around the bush,” Yang Zhen said with a nod, eyes bright as he stared at Yang Kai. His voice deepened, “It concerns your Blood Servants. The family has reached a decision.”

“My Blood Servants?” Yang Kai frowned, sensing something awry but defiantly staring back at Yang Zhen.

Under such a gaze, Yang Zhen felt a strong impulse to look away but controlled himself and nodded calmly. “Correct. To my knowledge, you have gathered seven elite Blood Servants in your hall, have you not?”

“Yes.” Yang Kai took a deep breath.

Ying Jiu and Qu Gaoyi were the first to follow him. Xiao Shun had joined after Eighth Brother Yang Quan’s elimination. Tu Feng, Tang Yuxian, Luo Hai, and Yan Lingxing had joined after Yang Kang and Yang Shen’s defeat that night.

Altogether, seven Blood Servants Hall experts had gathered around Yang Kai, each with cultivation at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

“If you had no means to break the Sealing Yuan Curse or to accelerate the healing of severely wounded Blood Servants, it would be one thing. These seven gathered around you would pose little threat. But you have accomplished what no one else could,” Yang Zhen stood from his seat and paced a few steps, then paused and turned to Yang Kai. “If I am right, all seven have now reached their peak Martial Peak condition?”

Judging by Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian’s improvement, this truth was apparent.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“I know what you intend next—leading these seven in an unstoppable assault to defeat the remaining Yang Family disciples one by one. As you defeat them, you can also recruit the Blood Servants following them. Am I correct?”

“You are, Elder. If not for being summoned back by you, I would have acted tonight,” Yang Kai admitted frankly.

Yang Zhen exhaled softly, “Seven Blood Servants, indeed no match for them all. You have truly created a miracle that even we old men find awe-inspiring. Yang Wei, Yang Zhao, and Yang Ying have gathered much support, but one of their Blood Servants has been incapacitated. With your seven leading the charge, you are bound to capture the others with ease and win without shedding blood.”

As he spoke, he seemed to envision a scene where Yang Wei and the others were powerless to resist, the very outcome Yang Kai sought.

“But...” Yang Zhen’s tone shifted, grave once more, “This violates the original intent of the succession war and the purpose for sending Blood Servants to participate.”

Yang Kai coldly chuckled. By now, if he still did not understand why the Elder Hall summoned him, he would be a fool.

A wave of anger surged within him. Taking a deep breath, he looked sharply at Yang Zhen, mocking, “The elders intend to summon the Blood Servants surrounding me back to the family, don’t they?”

Though Yang Zhen detected the change in attitude and tone, he was undeterred. Young men are all hotheaded. If Yang Kai did not grow angry now, he would not be young.

“Precisely. Glad you understand,” Yang Zhen nodded plainly.

“I don’t understand!” Yang Kai’s face darkened, paying no heed to the fact Yang Zhen was an elder, far senior in age, his tone extremely defiant.

Yang Zhen said, “As I said, you leading those seven Blood Servants to attack other Yang Family disciples contradicts the spirit of the succession war. You should know the core of the succession war is to compete based on the network one can build outside and one’s personal charisma. The broader the connections and greater the personal charm, the more support one can gather. After all, the prize is the succession to the next headship of the Yang Family. To become head, one must have the backing of the majority of forces. Merely relying on Blood Servants born within the family to win proves nothing.”
