## Chapter 2142 — Power of the Divine Spirit

"Senior Brother Huagu…" One of the middle-aged men glanced around, then asked the older man in a low, suspicious voice, "Are there Saint King Realm cultivators entering the Four Seasons Land?"

"Damn it—must be disciples from those great sects!" Another middle-aged man suddenly gritted his teeth in anger, "Just think—our Evil Moon Valley only managed to secure three spots, and even those required considerable tribute to Wuhua Hall. But these great sects can squander their spots so freely, even letting a Saint King Realm disciple take one. It’s simply outrageous!"

Hearing this, the older man called Huagu nodded slightly, “Junior Brother Zhou An makes sense. These two women must be from some great sect, so one of them qualified to enter with Saint King Realm cultivation. Judging by her appearance, she’s about to break through to the Origin Returning Realm.”

As he spoke, Huagu couldn’t help but feel a bit envious and resentful.

He recalled how, when he cultivated, every step was fraught with danger; he risked his life even for a few resources. But disciples from these great sects received completely different treatment.

They could enter secret realms that people like him struggled so hard to access, and easily break through here.

Comparing the two, his mood instantly soured.

The middle-aged man who spoke earlier looked fearful and hesitated, “If they’re from a great sect, we’d better leave first. If they misunderstand us, that could be bad.”

“Xiong Ning, what are you afraid of?” Zhou An shot him a sideways glance and snorted. “Even if they’re disciples of some great sect, it’s just one at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm and one at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. If there’s a misunderstanding, then let it be—what can they do to us?”

“Who says I’m afraid?” Xiong Ning retorted angrily, “I just don’t want to invite trouble for no reason!”

“Hmph, cowardly rat!” Zhou An snorted with contempt, clearly looking down on his fellow disciple.

“That bead in the woman’s hand… must be a fine Secret Treasure!” Huagu suddenly said in a low voice, his eyes fixed on the Xuan Realm Pearl in Liu Yan’s hand.

Zhou An’s eyes flickered, and he asked in a low voice, “Senior Brother Huagu, you mean…”

Xiong Ning clearly realized something too, his face changing slightly.

Huagu smiled faintly, “This place is deep underground, rarely visited, and the other side’s strength is low. Plus, she’s holding a precious treasure…”

Zhou An understood immediately and smiled, “I’ve long disliked these great sect disciples, always strutting around, acting superior. So what if they have a powerful backer? It’s nothing special. Senior Brother Huagu, whatever you decide, I’ll follow you to the end!”

“Isn’t this a bit much?” Xiong Ning’s legs trembled, and he stammered, “If their sect finds out… not only will we be finished, Evil Moon Valley might be doomed too…”

Zhou An shot Xiong Ning a cold look, “If you’re scared, get lost now and stop making snide remarks. But let me be clear: any Secret Treasures or Source Crystals we get later won’t be yours. Since these two women are from a great sect, they must be carrying plenty of good stuff!”

Hearing this, Xiong Ning gulped, and a trace of greed appeared on his fearful face.

He hesitated for a few breaths, then finally gritted his teeth, “Fine, I’ll stick with you two, come what may!”

“That’s more like it!” Zhou An smiled as he saw Xiong Ning give in.

“You pieces of trash!” Not far away, Liu Yan suddenly spoke coldly, her first words making the three from Evil Moon Valley twitch. “Muttering away, what schemes are you plotting?”

Huagu forced down his displeasure and forced a laugh, "Miss, you misunderstand. The three of us only sensed an unusual energy fluctuation from the canyon below and came to investigate, not expecting it was you two causing the commotion. If we disturbed you, please forgive us."

“Is that all?” Liu Yan remained icy.

“That’s all!” Huagu replied.

“Since you’ve finished investigating, why haven’t you left?” Liu Yan’s words were sharp, giving them no face at all. This only made the three from Evil Moon Valley more certain she was from a great sect—only such disciples were so arrogant.

Huagu felt a surge of anger, but kept smiling, “Miss, which sect are you from?”

“What does that have to do with you?” Liu Yan snorted.

“No need to be so distant, Miss.” Huagu smiled, “But in my opinion, your sect is probably one of the usual few. Evil Moon Valley has dealings with those great sects, our relations are good. Though we disturbed you, meeting you two here is fate.”

He paused, then turned to Zhang Ruoxi, “It seems this young lady is at a breakthrough point… The Spiritual Qi here is rich and dense, but who knows if any fierce demonic beasts are lurking below. If the commotion attracts a beast, with your cultivation… you might not be able to handle it.” As he spoke, he put on a righteous air and volunteered, “We’re not much, but we’re willing to act as protectors for you two!”

Zhou An nodded vigorously, “That’s right, we’ll protect you. Even if a demonic beast comes, you don’t need to worry.”

Xiong Ning stayed silent, but clearly agreed.

Liu Yan sneered, "Just you three pieces of trash? If a fierce demonic beast did come, I doubt you three could handle it!"

“Miss, you’re too harsh!” Huagu’s anger flared, and he said darkly, “We meant well. Even if you don’t accept, there’s no need to insult us!”

“That’s right, Evil Moon Valley may not be a great sect, but it’s not something anyone can insult!” Zhou An declared righteously, though it was unclear how he connected Liu Yan’s words to an insult against Evil Moon Valley.

“Why so much talk? Are you after me, or after this Secret Treasure…” Liu Yan said, tossing the Xuan Realm Pearl in her hand, “If you want to rob me, just do it. No need to beat around the bush.”

At these words, the three’s expressions changed slightly.

“Senior Brother…” Zhou An looked to Huagu.

Huagu pondered for a moment, then said in a low voice, “It seems she has no companions nearby. Otherwise, after all this time, why haven’t they shown up?”

“This is a stroke of luck!” Zhou An said excitedly, licking his lips and looking eager, no longer bothering to pretend, but instead glaring at Liu Yan with a sinister look, “Little girl, when I knock you down and strip you, don’t beg for mercy!”

He hadn’t thought much of Liu Yan before, but her earlier words had stirred up the darkness and evil in his heart.

He decided immediately: he'd take the treasure—and the woman too!

Just thinking about having the chance to ravage and defile a proud daughter of a great sect, Zhou An’s blood boiled.

“Do it!” Huagu shouted.

In an instant, the three from Evil Moon Valley unleashed their Origin Qi. Even though their opponent was a woman of lower cultivation, they didn’t hold back, attacking with full force.

The old man opened his mouth and spat out a large bell. Its surface was covered in countless intricate characters, and as Origin Qi poured in, a visible halo appeared around it, looking solid and impenetrable.

This bell was clearly a defensive Secret Treasure.

Huagu summoned the treasure not to defend himself, but to drive it toward Zhang Ruoxi.

His plan was clear—no matter how troublesome Liu Yan was, Zhang Ruoxi, with her Third Stage Saint King Realm cultivation, was no threat. As long as he captured Zhang Ruoxi first, Liu Yan would have to submit.

So his first move targeted Zhang Ruoxi.

But just as the bell was about to envelop Zhang Ruoxi, Liu Yan suddenly sneered, “Wishful thinking!”

She raised her hand, and a black feather about three zhang long shot out, flying to Zhang Ruoxi’s side and transforming into a burning barrier that wrapped around her.

The moment the feather formed the barrier, an otherworldly pressure descended, making the three from Evil Moon Valley tremble in fear.

It felt as if a powerful will was lurking in the void, staring at them like a tiger eyeing its prey. In an instant, cold sweat drenched their bodies.

“What is that!” Huagu’s eyes widened as he stared at the black flame barrier around Zhang Ruoxi, feeling a terrifying heat radiate out, as if it could burn all things.

Yet Zhang Ruoxi, sitting calmly within the barrier, was completely unaffected.

The bell-shaped Secret Treasure, however, flashed wildly under the terrifying heat. The intricate characters engraved on its surface shattered one by one, and when the bell touched the black flame barrier, it was tainted by a wisp of black fire that didn’t extinguish, continuously burning away the treasure’s spirit.

"Divine Spirit aura!" Huagu cried out in terror.

He was at least Third Stage Dao Origin Realm. Even if he’d never seen a Divine Spirit, he could deduce from the clues—the terrifying pressure, the evil fire that seemed able to burn all things—all pointed to the most fearsome existence in the world: a Divine Spirit!

He was right: that black feather was indeed a feather of Luanfeng, a Divine Spirit.

Yang Kai had previously given the Luanfeng feather he’d found to Liu Yan. After some time, Liu Yan had refined it, gaining a trace of Divine Spirit power.

Even a sliver of Divine Spirit power was something Dao Origin Realm cultivators could not resist.

That was why Liu Yan had no fear of these three.
