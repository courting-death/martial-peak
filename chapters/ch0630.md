## Chapter 630 — The Fire of Divine Sense

On the ground, Yang Kai and Yun Xuan rolled together in a tangle, their clothes in disarray, a chaotic sight.

Both had been poisoned by the Enchantress's Divine Sense toxin; this Divine Sense poison was incomparably fiercer than ordinary toxins, and even someone as strong as Yang Kai could not fully withstand it, let alone Yun Xuan.

As they writhed together, Yun Xuan's consciousness slowly returned. The heat and hollowness in her body made her crave caresses and filling; the man who smelled of masculinity, Yang Kai, became her only lifeline and she clung to him desperately. But when she saw Yang Kai's face clearly, she wanted to struggle and push him away, yet her body would not obey. Above them, the Enchantress floated with a face full of excitement, watching the state she had forced her into; Yun Xuan's eyes overflowed with aggrieved, shameful tears.

This absurd and absurdly shameful scene—Yun Xuan had never imagined that one day she would find herself skin to skin and embracing with a man she did not know well under such circumstances.

Although she usually dressed provocatively and behaved boldly, she had never before stood naked opposite any man.

The repressed desire within her grew ever stronger, yet the resisting emotion was not extinguished; Yun Xuan's reason told her that even if she were to die, she must die with her purity intact.

Looking at her scattered garments and feeling the chill of her exposed flesh, Yun Xuan reached out to slap Yang Kai, but that white arm, as if moved by some ghost, instead wound about his neck and held him fast.

Her kicked-out feet likewise refused to obey and wrapped around his waist.

Her hot, full body pressed tightly against Yang Kai's; the pleasure from their bodies and the soul's tremor left Yun Xuan somewhat bewildered, and she could not help but utter a low sound as strange sensations ran through her.

Realizing this, Yun Xuan's face grew even redder.

"Yang Kai..." Yun Xuan whispered, the sound of her voice altered in a way that made her wish she could sink into a hole and hide.

Between her legs was a mess; the verdant grass was damp with dew, leaving her feeling empty and lonely.

Suddenly something hot and steel-like pressed against that place; Yun Xuan could not help but cry out, her delicate body trembling as the snow-white skin flushed a deep red.

She swiftly understood what she was about to suffer.

Resistance proved childish and laughable beneath the Enchantress's Divine Sense toxin; Yun Xuan slowly closed her eyes, abandoned her inner protest, and surrendered to the body's throbbing.

A tearing, searing pain shot up from below; Yun Xuan's beautiful eyes flew wide in shock as she let out a plaintive scream, her hands digging into the muscles of Yang Kai's back, her nails leaving deep gouges.

Petals fell in profusion.

The initial agony soon ebbed, replaced by endless tumult and delight. The man upon her showed no tenderness; in his savage, beast-like thrusts Yun Xuan felt her consciousness soar, up and down, experiencing a pleasure she had never known.

Her lips, crimson like a gem, were bitten until they bled; amid the loud moans, pain and pleasure braided together indistinguishably.

Tears streamed continuously from the corners of her eyes, running down her cheeks to the ground and wetting the soil.

Weakly opening her eyes and looking at the somewhat young, naive face looming over her, Yun Xuan suddenly found that face so alien.

The man had gone mad—his eyes were bloodshot, his breath heavy, veins standing on his neck; like a crazed beast he raised that great spear and launched assault after assault.

Yun Xuan's expression froze, for in those blood-red, seemingly irrational eyes she detected a trace of composure that had not been extinguished.

There was no time to ponder; the body's pleasure drove her to cry out again and again.

"Very good, such a delicious flavor." The Enchantress floated down, surveying the lustful commotion below with a face aflame, clearly moved.

She drifted to Yang Kai and Yun Xuan's side, stood there, and reached out a smooth, fair hand to touch Yang Kai's muscular back as if to encourage him, whispering in his ear, "Use more force, faster!"

Yang Kai indeed grew much more violent in his movements, and the Enchantress could not help but giggle.

Time passed and the release of desire climbed unceasingly until it neared its peak; the Enchantress grew intent, as though waiting for something.

Just as that peak was about to arrive, the Enchantress suddenly made her move.

Her seemingly boneless small hand plunged from Yang Kai's back like a bamboo breaking through, driving straight through his body and opening a hole; not only that, Yun Xuan, who lay beneath him, had her lower abdomen torn as well.

Yun Xuan shrieked; in her tear-stained eyes a hint of relief flickered.

Their mingled blood flowed together, and the scent of the passionately entwined lovers' blood was honeyed to the Enchantress.

"That's the taste... that's the taste..." The Enchantress's body trembled nonstop, as if in this moment she had found great solace and satisfaction; her legs tightened, and from between them some milky-white fluid trickled, sliding down her long limbs.

She slowly closed her eyes and surrendered to the incoming delight.

The redness in Yang Kai's eyes vanished abruptly; in that instant he became clearer-headed than ever before.

His body sprang from Yun Xuan like a cannon shot; both hands seized the Enchantress's small hand that had pierced him and with brutal force wrenched.

Crack...

The snow-white, boneless little hand snapped cleanly; pale bone stumps were exposed to the air and emerald blood flowed from the severed wrist.

A piteous scream escaped; the Enchantress's wide eyes contorted in disbelief, her lovely face twisting as if she had fallen from the clouds into hell. She stared incredulously at Yang Kai, then staggered and pulled her hand out from his body.

Before she could steady herself, her vision blurred, and the youth who had just been enjoying a woman's body appeared before her, thrusting out an iron-bound hand that clamped around her throat.

"You finally took the bait!" Yang Kai's expression was ice-cold, his gaze merciless; his voice, like a wind from the abyssal depths, sent a chill curling into the Enchantress's core.

Staring at him in utter terror, the Enchantress noted that his body really had been pierced and blood streamed out, dyeing him red, but his movements were steady and calm. In his eyes she read mockery and disdain, and she suddenly realized that from start to finish this youth had never been under her control.

"Impossible!" the Enchantress howled hysterically, ugly as a madwoman. "You cannot resist my Divine Sense toxin!"

"Why impossible?" Yang Kai sneered, tightening his grip and slamming the Enchantress to the ground with great force.

Thud... the frail woman's body shuddered with immense pain, leaving her almost unable to breathe.

Yet even with her flesh under another's control, the Enchantress felt no fear—only boundless resentment and malice.

Huge surges of Divine Sense power erupted from her mind, instantly tearing at the defenses of Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness and pouring in with potent toxin.

She intended one final blow to kill Yang Kai and avenge the humiliation of her severed arm.

Yang Kai's brow furrowed and his body trembled slightly, but he quickly regained his composure.

"Divine Sense Fire?" Sensing the force erupting within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, the Enchantress finally grew afraid. Within his Sea of Consciousness there issued a scorching aura of fire—an intensity capable of burning away her Divine Sense toxin, akin to the attribute of True Yang Yuan Qi.

"So this is called Divine Sense Fire; thank you for the hint." Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

Ever since absorbing the True Spirit's power within that jade in Zhongdu, Yang Kai had noticed changes in his Divine Sense: it had become scorching like fire, bearing some similarity to True Yang Yuan Qi.

Moreover, his entire Sea of Consciousness felt unlike before; the sea water within seemed to flow like burning flames.

This transformation puzzled Yang Kai; with no one to explain it to him, he had not understood what had happened to his Divine Sense until now.

Hearing the Enchantress's words, Yang Kai at once felt that this change would be beneficial to him.

The Enchantress's Divine Sense contained toxin, while his Divine Sense held scorching fire; his power could now be far more formidable than before.

"Don't kill me—I can acknowledge you as my master!" the Enchantress cried out.

Her flesh could not match Yang Kai's strength, and her proud Divine Sense power and toxins could not touch him; the Enchantress immediately understood that if she did not beg for mercy she would soon die.

"Acknowledge me as your master?" Yang Kai's brow tightened.

"Yes, the demon race has always been your people's companions. If you nod, I can imprint my soul and obey your commands from then on." The Enchantress nodded hastily.

"No need. I have no interest in such a dangerous servant." Yang Kai's face was utterly cold; as he spoke, True Yuan burst from his fist, and with the Enchantress's panicked gaze upon him he struck her exquisite face with a punch.

Sensing the crisis, the Enchantress screamed and unleashed her Divine Sense power, striking at Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness in a desperate bid for survival.

Yang Kai remained unmoved.

Boom...

Like a melon split open, the Enchantress's head was instantly smashed apart. Yang Kai, still not entirely satisfied, continued to pummel her until no sign of life remained within her soft body.

Had her physical body been stronger, with her Transcendent Realm cultivation Yang Kai would not have killed her so easily.

 The pull in his mind resurfaced; the dispersed Divine Sense energies of the Enchantress were all drawn into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

Though the Enchantress's words had tempted Yang Kai, with his current means he simply could not enslave such an expert.

Unlike Di Mo, the Enchantress was too dangerous; to eliminate future trouble, Yang Kai could not allow her to follow him.

He coughed lightly, blood welling at the corner of his mouth.

Yang Kai wiped it away, reached into the Black Book Space, and took out the Wan Yao Ling Milk to swallow.

Being pierced through like that was no light wound; fortunately, at the crucial moment he had avoided the vital spots, so it would not be fatal.

With the Wan Yao Ling Milk, such injuries should heal in a matter of days.

Unsure of Yun Xuan's condition, Yang Kai's expression grew complicated; after a moment's hesitation, he walked toward the Yun Xuan lying in a pool of blood.
