## Chapter 693 — Should Celebrate

When Chu Lingxiao learned that the current Sect Leader of Lingxiao Pavilion had actually advanced to the second Stage of Transcendent Realm, his eyes could not help but brighten.

He knew full well how exceptional one's aptitude and talent had to be to reach such a cultivation level in that world;

When he left all those years ago he had not left behind much, only a single Spatial Pouch, and that Spatial Pouch was later given by Ling Taixu to Yang Kai, who in turn passed it on to Su Yan.

"So you hail from the Zhongdu Eight Great Families. I heard of their might when I was over there," Chu Lingxiao nodded slightly.

"They can't compare to the forces here," Yang Kai said, his expression dim; any power on this side was stronger than the Zhongdu Eight Great Families.

"How did you come across?" Chu Lingxiao asked.

Yang Kai promptly related how he and Shui Ling had searched for a Void Passage together and arrived on this side.

"The Water Divine Hall… yes, I have heard of it. Over by the sea, a power that cultivates water-based techniques," Chu Lingxiao nodded faintly. "You've had a hard road; it's impressive you managed to come this far."

"This is the path I chose," Yang Kai answered with a grave tone.

"Do you have any plans for the future?" Chu Lingxiao asked kindly.

"Not for now, but I wish to find two people."

"Two people?"

"My two senior sisters; they are also on this side," Yang Kai said casually.

Chu Lingxiao smiled when he heard this and nodded. "What are their distinguishing marks? I can have people in the Sect keep an eye out."

Yang Kai was delighted and hastily described the appearances of Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, then added, "Strictly speaking they traveled with four people. Besides my two senior sisters there is also a Demonic Master — the very demonic general's body the Founder sealed back then. But now another Demonic Master's soul has entered and taken control of that body."

"A Demonic Master?"

"Rest assured, Founder, he should not be one of the demon race; it's only that the technique he cultivates is evil. He did help me a great deal at times and can be considered a friend; he calls himself Di Mo. I do not know his true name."

"Di Mo? I've never heard of him, but I trust your judgment. And the other one?"

"That old fellow goes by Meng Wuya, a rather mysterious person."

"Meng Wuya?" Chu Lingxiao's expression changed. "You said Meng Wuya?"

"Does the Founder know him?"

"I do, actually. I know a man called Meng Wuya, though I don't know if he's the same man. What does he look like?"

Yang Kai hurriedly described Meng Wuya's features, and Chu Lingxiao's face took on an oddness as he murmured, "Is it really him? But wasn't he supposed to be dead? That old fox — he's actually been hiding all along, and somehow escaped to your world."

Yang Kai was astonished. "So the Founder is very familiar with Shopkeeper Meng?"

"Not unfamiliar. I have sparred with him several times; there was no grudge, only exchanges of skill. That man… hm. He is a tenacious character. Two hundred years ago he was quite famous, but after a battle with the Demon Lord he vanished without a trace; we all thought he was dead."

"He sparred with the Founder?" Yang Kai's eyes widened. "What level was he at to exchange blows with you?"

"A Saint Realm master," Chu Lingxiao said, glancing at Yang Kai in mild surprise. "Why do you ask?"

Yang Kai's mouth twitched as he replied, "A few years ago he only seemed to possess the very peak of Divine Roaming Realm. When I parted from him later he was around Transcendent Stage two or three, but he appeared to have been sealed by something."

"Ha ha ha!" Chu Lingxiao laughed heartily. "That old fellow deserved it; he must have been struck by the Demon Lord's Tianxuan Sealing Art — a great divine sealing with three layers. From what you say it seems he has already broken the first layer. It's rare he escaped the Demon Lord with his life; his luck is truly remarkable."

Yang Kai's eyes glittered with indescribable disbelief and astonishment.

No wonder he had always felt Shopkeeper Meng was mysterious; he was in truth a top Saint Realm expert who, having lifted the first seal, had returned to Transcendent standards. If the second seal were broken he might return to Saint Realm, and if the third were lifted he could certainly reach the pinnacle.

"You've brought me good news," Chu Lingxiao looked pleased. "But finding him won't be easy. When he fought the Demon Lord the demon race suffered some losses; they hold grudges. Until his strength fully recovers that old fellow will likely hide and not reveal himself to the world. After all, he is a famous figure — if the demons learn of him, he might be doomed."

Yang Kai was stunned.

"I'll have people watch for your two senior sisters' movements; if there's news I'll inform you. You can now be considered a disciple of my Tianxiao Sect. From now on, reside here without restraint — take this as your home."

"I understand." Yang Kai drew a deep breath and inclined his head solemnly.

Upon learning that the man before him was the Founder of Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai immediately felt he was no longer an outsider.

It was fortunate that Chu Lingxiao had detected a trace of the Locking Demon Chain's aura and found him by following it; otherwise Yang Kai would likely still be wandering without a home or belonging.

"Cang Yan," Chu Lingxiao called.

The one waiting outside the door, Cang Yan, immediately entered. "Your disciple is present."

"Arrange a place for this junior nephew."

"Your disciple understands."

"By the way, Founder, I have one more favor to ask," Yang Kai suddenly said.

"If it's within reason, speak."

"For certain reasons I need to improve my alchemy, so I'd like to request the Sect provide me with some medicinal ingredients."

"Have Cang Yan arrange it. This is also a fortune for our Tianxiao Sect!" Chu Lingxiao smiled and nodded.

Yang Kai's voluntary offer to refine pills for the Sect was naturally something the Sect wished to see.

After taking leave of Chu Lingxiao, Yang Kai and Cang Yan walked out, and Cang Yan regarded Yang Kai oddly for a moment. "You came from another world?"

"Yes."

"No wonder I never heard of you before. I always wondered how such an outstanding young man could be so obscure. Now I understand. We're family now; your senior uncle will look after you. If anyone dares bully you, your senior uncle will go and wipe out their entire clan." Cang Yan grinned.

Yang Kai’s expression turned stiff.

When they returned to the courtyard Yang Kai was astonished to find Fei Yu lying lazily in the corridor, her face flushed, her lithe curves stirring the imagination; her bosom half bared, the valley between inviting.

She held a wine jar in her hand and was drinking heartily.

“Drinking again.” Cang Yan slowly shook his head and whispered to Yang Kai, “That senior aunt of yours doesn’t have the slightest air of a woman. She loves her wine and is steeped in its reek year-round. I doubt anyone will ever want her in this lifetime.”

Before his words had finished, the wine jar in Fei Yu's hand flew over; Cang Yan caught it coolly, sniffed it, and frowned. "Isn't this Thousand Red Flower Wine?"

“Hmph.” Fei Yu rose gracefully, casting Cang Yan a sidelong glance. “The Thousand Red Flower Wine isn’t for you.”

"But you promised me earlier," Cang Yan complained.

"That jar of Thousand Red Flower Wine, I have already given to this young brother."

"Given to him?" Cang Yan stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, then suddenly plastered on a smile and obsequiously said, "Junior nephew, look… your senior uncle has been busy regarding your matters for two months; shouldn't you show your gratitude?"

Yang Kai chuckled. "Good things I keep for myself."

Cang Yan blinked, clearly not expecting Yang Kai to turn him down so squarely.

Fei Yu's brows knitted slightly; suspicious she asked, "How did he suddenly become a junior nephew? Has this young brother formally joined our Tianxiao Sect?"

"Strictly speaking, he already is a disciple of our Tianxiao Sect."

"How so?" Fei Yu looked bewildered, her beautiful eyes staring at Yang Kai in surprise.

Cang Yan briefly explained the origin of the matter, and Fei Yu became somewhat delighted. "So that makes me his senior aunt as well?"

"Yes." Cang Yan nodded.

"Heh heh, a cheap junior nephew," Li Wan appeared from somewhere, with stature not even reaching Yang Kai’s chest. hands clasped behind his back as he appraised Yang Kai with an air of nonchalance; his eyes shone with a keen light and he nodded slightly. "Not bad."

"Greetings, senior uncles and aunt," Yang Kai cupped his fist in salute.

The three exchanged looks and burst into boisterous laughter; Fei Yu laughed so hard she could hardly straighten up — as delighted as could be.

Li Wan suddenly said, "Hm, I think we should hold a feast to celebrate the junior nephew's formal return to his roots."

"Good idea!" Cang Yan agreed, his face serious. "Let's hold it on Qixiu Peak."

"No!" Fei Yu's face instantly changed and she hurriedly objected.

Cang Yan had already launched himself away with a movement of his body; from afar his voice drifted back, "I'll go hunt some wild game."

Li Wan flashed away as well. "I'll fetch Fei Jian — good things can't lack him."

In the blink of an eye only Fei Yu and Yang Kai remained.

The beautiful woman ground her teeth, staring after the directions Cang Yan and Li Wan had vanished toward, and cursed, "You swine!"

After cursing she smiled sweetly and shook her head. "Always scheming for my Thousand Red Flower Wine — a bunch of shameless rascals."

Then she glanced at Yang Kai. "Come on; if we don’t satisfy them this time, they’ll end up lingering at my Qixiu Peak, what a headache."

"Should I come too?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"You're their flimsy excuse; of course you're coming." Fei Yu nodded, and before he could protest she grabbed Yang Kai by the collar and swept him toward a distant mountain peak.

They had barely taken flight when she suddenly felt a strange heaviness; her pretty face changed and she immediately increased her speed.

She cast Yang Kai a sidelong glance and frowned. "You're wearing the Hunyuan Shackles?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

"Don't pour your True Yuan into them while we're flying; it's making my flight difficult." Fei Yu glared at him. That last moment had almost embarrassed her.

Yang Kai grinned and withdrew his True Yuan; their speed instantly increased.

Before long they descended onto a beautiful mountain peak.
