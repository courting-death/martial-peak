## Chapter 270 — Poison Pill

On this day, before dawn, the door to Yang Kai's room was suddenly flung open. Dong Qingyan rushed in with great excitement, darting directly in front of Yang Kai. "Cousin..."

"What cousin?" Yang Kai glared at her, cutting off her words.

Dong Qingyan stuck out her tongue and quickly corrected herself, adopting an air of authority as she commanded, "Yang Huwei, accompany this young lady out!"

After all, she was the young lady of the Dong Family, and the Dong Family had ties to the Yang Family. If someone were to overhear Dong Qingyan's address to Yang Kai, they would surely guess at his identity.

Thus, after some discussion, they decided that Yang Kai would play the role of Dong Qingyan's bodyguard.

It was common for the young masters and ladies of great families to have a few attendants when they went out, so such a title was quite reasonable.

Looking at the sky outside, Yang Kai casually said, "Go play by yourself. I won't accompany you today!"

Dong Qingyan was not angry; she merely chuckled, "Yang Huwei, don’t you want to enter that place?"

Yang Kai's expression shifted.

"Is today the right time?"

For the past few days, Yang Kai had been asking her how he could get closer to Dan Sheng Peak, but Dong Qingyan had not elaborated, only saying that the time was not yet right. Bringing it up today naturally gave Yang Kai a glimmer of hope.

"Then do you want to go out with this young lady?" Dong Qingyan looked at him smugly.

Yang Kai quickly got out of bed.

In the town of Yao Wang Valley, Dong Qingyan weaved through the crowd, as agile as a fish swimming in water. Yang Kai, dressed in tight-fitting attire, stood with his hands behind his back, his expression serious, closely following her, never straying far.

This appearance clearly marked him as Dong Qingyan's attendant.

As they reached the eastern edge of the town, Dong Qingyan's small face flushed with excitement and nervousness. Yang Kai could even clearly hear the sound of her heartbeat. She took a deep breath, covering her chest with her hand, and it took her a while to calm down.

Yang Kai looked around and noticed that many people had gathered in this area, each of them adorned with unique petal-like insignias on their chests. Some had one petal, others two, in a blend of gold, silver, and white.

These people were all alchemists.

Most were Lower-Level Earth-Grade alchemists, with many Common-Grade ones among them. At least two hundred people had gathered here, bustling and lively.

Dong Qingyan seemed to pull out a badge from somewhere, a silver petal that she pinned to her chest, her bosom puffed up as if she wanted the whole world to know that she was a Middle-Level Common-Grade alchemist.

"What are you doing?" Yang Kai felt something was off and quietly asked.

"Just wait! Whether you can enter depends on this time," Dong Qingyan replied softly, her small face filled with seriousness.

Yang Kai frowned and closed his eyes, slowly releasing his Divine Sense to listen to the nearby alchemists' conversations.

Before long, his expression grew strange.

These people had come from all corners of the world, gathered here to seek apprenticeship under the elder Xiao Fusheng of Yao Wang Valley's Yun Yin Peak, to learn the art of alchemy.

Yang Kai opened his eyes and looked at Dong Qingyan, asking, "Are you here to become a disciple?"

Dong Qingyan giggled, "Of course! Master Xiao is accepting disciples; it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! I escaped from home just for today!"

As she spoke, she looked at Yang Kai with a pitiful expression, "Yang Huwei, you wouldn't want to tell my brother, would you?"

"I just want to know how this relates to my goals."

"Yun Yin Peak is not far from there. If you can get in..." Dong Qingyan hinted.

Yang Kai's heart stirred. Indeed, if he could enter Yun Yin Peak, he might find a chance to enter Dan Sheng Peak as well; the two peaks were only separated by two mountain ridges.

"But I don't know anything about alchemy."

Dong Qingyan laughed lightly, "Master Xiao accepts disciples, and there must be hidden secrets. Even if you don’t know alchemy, there’s still a chance, depending on your qualifications."

"Yang Huwei..." Dong Qingyan swayed Yang Kai's arm, "Look at how much I've done for you. Please don’t tell my brother, okay? Besides, if I can become a disciple of Master Xiao, it would bring glory to the family. Even if my father finds out later, he would only praise me. So, please don’t do anything that would be thankless."

Yang Kai replied indifferently, "You should see if you can get in first."

"I will definitely make it!" Dong Qingyan said confidently. "I've prepared a lot for this day. Just wait and see. I just don’t know if you can get in."

Yang Kai secretly shook his head.

He never expected that Dong Qingyan's method would be this; it was a good plan, but Yang Kai felt uncertain. He had never dabbled in alchemy; how could he pass Master Xiao's test?

However, there was no choice but to try; after all, he wouldn't lose anything.

As time passed, more and more alchemists gathered in this place, each one filled with excitement, just like Dong Qingyan, nervous yet expectant. Many alchemists even displayed expressions of reverence.

It was clear how much these people admired and worshipped Xiao Fusheng of Yun Yin Peak.

Yang Kai listened closely to their conversations and learned a lot.

Xiao Fusheng was among the top elders of Yao Wang Valley, renowned for his alchemy skills, even surpassing the Valley Master of Yao Wang Valley. He was one of the few alchemists in the world who had reached Upper-Level Mystery-Grade.

Above Mystery-Grade was Spirit-Grade, a height that no one had ever reached.

Xiao Fusheng dedicated his life to alchemy. Although he occupied a secluded peak in Yao Wang Valley, he had never taken in disciples, nor did he marry or have children, dedicating his entire life to the art of alchemy.

In the realm of alchemy, Xiao Fusheng held unparalleled prestige.

Months ago, news spread that Xiao Fusheng was accepting disciples, causing a stir across the land. Countless alchemists flocked to seek apprenticeship under Master Xiao, hoping to inherit his legacy.

The Eight Great Families of Zhongdu and other top-tier forces even tried to send their family alchemists to him, but all were rejected by Master Xiao.

Until today, in the town of Yao Wang Valley, there was a test set exclusively by Master Xiao. Only those who passed the test could become disciples of Yun Yin Peak.

Master Xiao's acceptance of disciples had no restrictions; regardless of where one came from or what kind of force they belonged to, as long as they had the qualifications, they could learn his alchemical ways.

There was only one requirement: the age must not exceed twenty-five.

Thus, everyone gathered here was from the younger generation of alchemists. Some even chose not to attend the Alchemy Conference just to be here for the chance to enter Yun Yin Peak.

Time slowly passed.

Yang Kai stood behind Dong Qingyan, attentively observing the surroundings while secretly watching.

As the sun rose higher, a commotion in the crowd signaled the arrival of disciples from Yao Wang Valley.

These disciples were not Master Xiao's disciples but rather alchemists from other peaks, entrusted to oversee today's test.

Not far ahead stood a high platform that had been set up in advance. All the alchemists participating in the test gathered around this platform.

Four disciples from Yao Wang Valley jumped onto the platform. The leading figure was a middle-aged man with a three-petal golden flower embroidered on his chest. His expression was stern, exuding an aura of authority, as he held a massive medicinal cauldron, striding forward with confidence.

A wave of gasps arose.

"It’s Qin Ze from Yao Wang Valley! He’s only thirty-five but has already reached the Upper-Level Heaven-Grade as an alchemist!"

"He is a prodigy of Yao Wang Valley. It’s said that he will be the next Valley Master!"

"Shh, quiet..."

Qin Ze approached the platform and placed the massive medicinal cauldron on a table. The three disciples from Yao Wang Valley behind him also halted.

Scanning the crowd, Qin Ze clasped his fists and said, "Everyone, my Master Xiao has set a test here today to recruit disciples. I, Qin, am unworthy to oversee this!"

The special status of alchemists made everyone in the crowd hold him in high regard. Moreover, having spent years with medicinal pills and cauldrons, many of them were not well-versed in social niceties and were reluctant to engage in idle chatter.

As a genius among alchemists, Qin Ze's pride and indifference were even more pronounced.

After a brief introduction, he solemnly unveiled the massive medicinal cauldron, and an unusual fragrance wafted through the air, causing everyone to be momentarily stunned.

"The test is simple! Here are some pills, personally refined by my Master Xiao for today. If you wish to join Yun Yin Peak, come up and take a pill to consume. If you can refine the medicinal effects without issue, you will pass the test. The rest of you may proceed as you wish!"

With that, Qin Ze stepped aside, and the three young disciples from Yao Wang Valley stepped forward, looking down at the crowd with indifferent expressions.

Several hundred people stood below the platform, none daring to be the first to take the plunge.

Though Qin Ze spoke lightly, everyone knew that Master Xiao's test would surely be challenging. The crowd was now hoping someone else would take the initiative, not wanting to be the first to step forward as a test subject.

The disciples from Yao Wang Valley were not in a hurry; they simply stood on the platform, waiting quietly.

After a long while, someone finally asked, "May I ask, what kind of pill is this?"

One of the Yao Wang Valley disciples sneered, "Poison Pill!"

The crowd erupted in an uproar.

Although they knew Master Xiao's test would not be easy, the method of the test still greatly exceeded their expectations. Starting off by having people consume a poison pill—who could withstand that? Life was precious; if one failed the test and perished here, wouldn’t that be too unwise?

Qin Ze replied indifferently, "Though it is a poison pill, it is not lethal! However, if your qualifications are insufficient to consume it, you will be weak for at least three to five months."

Hearing that it was not lethal, many people's spirits were lifted. After all, Master Xiao was a renowned master and would not take lives.

This large cauldron of poison pills was probably just meant to deter those who sought to take advantage of the situation.

But who among those present lacked confidence in themselves? After a moment of contemplation, someone leaped onto the platform, "I'll give it a try!"

"I'll go too!"

With one person taking the lead, many responded in kind.

In a flurry, over a dozen people rushed up.

"Please!" The disciples from Yao Wang Valley gestured.

Those individuals stepped forward, each taking a pill from the cauldron and placing it in their mouths.

"Please refine the medicinal effects!" 

The more than ten people who consumed the pills quickly sat cross-legged, circulating their respective cultivation methods.

The several hundred spectators below all widened their eyes, carefully observing, not wanting to miss a single detail.
