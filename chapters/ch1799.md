## Chapter 1799 — A Rat’s Son Also Knows How to Dig

In the Star Domain, Yang Kai fled with all his might.

Although the Divine Bird was repelled by the laws of heaven and earth and had to retreat for the moment, Yang Kai knew his danger was far from over.

For a dazzling purple light was rapidly closing in on his back.

Zi Long!

Yang Kai hardly needed to think to know who owned that purple glow; with such a conspicuous color, who else could it be but Zi Long, the one who had cultivated the Purple Qi Long River Technique?

Since Zi Long was in pursuit, Xu Wei must be with him.

At his current strength, if he were in his prime he might still have been wantonly reckless against a First Stage of the Void King Realm, but facing an expert like Zi Long he felt utterly powerless inside.

Besides, earlier when he had been chased by the Divine Bird he had repeatedly used Spatial Force and exhausted himself; his body had even been pierced by the Divine Bird's feather and wounded. Now Yang Kai only wanted to run as far as possible and dared not slow down.

Yet even though he possessed Spatial Force, after a long pursuit and total exertion he was beginning to feel the strain.

Each time he mobilized his Spatial Force he could barely move a dozen li, and such a distance was nothing to a Second Stage of the Void King Realm — even without mastery, with Zi Long's power he could cover that distance in the blink of an eye.

Helpless, Yang Kai produced the Star Shuttle, sat cross‑legged upon it, drove it forward, and simultaneously activated his Wind‑and‑Thunder Wings.

A roar of wind and thunder erupted behind him as a pair of translucent wings unfolded — the left shimmering with wind energy, the right crackling with lightning. His speed soared instantly.

He glanced back and silently observed for a moment, and after confirming his current speed could roughly match Zi Long's pursuit he felt somewhat reassured.

As long as he could buy time, he would have a chance to recover.

However, deciding where to flee to now was a crucial problem.

The Everlasting Tree's pull was simply too great; he was certain Zi Long would never give up. Therefore he had to choose a definite, safe destination.

Within the Star Domain, the only cultivation stars Yang Kai was truly familiar with were Tongxuan Continent and Dark Star. But those two places were far too distant—flying there would take a year or two—and neither could be considered safe.

If he led Zi Long to either place it would only bring disaster — neither Tongxuan Continent nor the Dark Star had experts capable of resisting Zi Long.

Tongxuan Continent was out, Dark Star was out — so where should he go?

Yang Kai was momentarily at a loss.

After years of roaming the Star Domain he realized his connections were far too limited; at the moment his life was threatened he had nowhere to turn.

Thinking this, he sank his consciousness into the Sea of Consciousness, manifested a Spirit Body, and looked upward.

Above the Sea of Consciousness, countless stars shimmered, their lights flickering like scattered points across the void.

That was the Star Chart he had refined into his Sea of Consciousness, a Star Chart that encompassed the entire Star Domain!

His Divine Sense quickly traversed the Star Chart, searching for a refuge.

After inspecting each place he shook his head slowly, his expression growing darker...

For a time he could not find a suitable spot.

After a while he saw a certain place and his eyes lit up; he murmured, "Right — I can go there. How stupid of me."

He silently scolded himself for being hasty and forgetful to have overlooked that place; if he could escape into it, even if Zi Long were a Second Stage Void King, so what? Not to mention him, even those peerless ancient fiends wouldn't be able to haul him out.

It was an absolutely safe haven!

Moreover, he could use the place to consolidate the gains from this round and perhaps take the opportunity to break through to the Void King Realm.

The only thing separating him from the Void King Realm now was comprehension—his understanding of realm and the might of Heavenly Dao. In every other aspect, whether his physical body or Divine Sense, he already far surpassed ordinary Void Kings.

So if he could advance to the Void King Realm he would no longer need to fear Zi Long.

"Decided — I'm going there!" Yang Kai barked softly; his Spirit Body dispersed, his mind fled the Sea of Consciousness, and returned to his flesh.

In the next moment he opened his eyes, a sharp light flashing within them; he turned his head and cast a sinister glance at Zi Long chasing at his back, sneering, "Chase on, chase on — one day you'll be the one to regret it, hmph!"

With a burst of Saint Yuan the Star Shuttle's speed abruptly increased.

"That bastard!" From several thousand li away Zi Donglai cursed angrily, "What secret art did he use to move so fast?"

Zi Long's face was also sullen; his mood was very bad.

He had thought that without the Divine Bird's interference it would be effortless to capture Yang Kai with his strength, but unexpectedly, chasing Yang Kai through the Star Domain there was no sign of the distance between them shrinking.

That brat could actually rival him in speed!

"Exactly as you said, Young Master — this brat must have used some overdrawing secret art to be so swift; but rest assured, when his art fails his speed will plummet, and with Zi Long's ability he can be easily caught," Xu Wei said hurriedly to calm Zi Donglai.

It wasn’t that he was worried Zi Donglai might harm himself out of anger—rather, he was the one now under another’s roof. If Zi Donglai’s fury had nowhere else to go and ended up directed at him instead, wouldn’t he be the one suffering for Yang Kai’s mess?

He would not do such a foolish thing.

All he wished for was safety; beyond that he no longer dared to hope for anything.

Zi Donglai gave him a sidelong glance that made Xu Wei's heart pound; not knowing what the Young Master was thinking, he could only force a wry smile.

"Are you certain he used a secret art? Are you certain it will fail?" Zi Donglai asked.

Xu Wei was suddenly at a loss for words.

He thought to himself, "Goddamn it — you just said he used a secret art; I was only following your lead, and now you ask me? Are you fucking stupid!"

Xu Wei seethed in his heart, furious, yet dared not let it show on his face; he was miserable.

"Trash!" Zi Donglai spat and turned his head away.

Xu Wei put on a bland smile and said, "Yes, yes — this old servant is trash!"

I will never play along with you again... Xu Wei vowed inwardly.

While the two spoke, Zi Long continued gazing deeply forward.

His Divine Sense was far stronger than Zi Donglai's and Xu Wei's; his sight was acute, so even across several thousand li he could see parts of Yang Kai's situation.

Yang Kai had indeed used a secret art — one that caused wings to sprout from his back.

Although Zi Long had never cultivated such an art, he knew such things did not drain much from a martial artist; the expectation that Yang Kai's art would fail and leave him exhausted was simply impossible.

He turned his gaze back and frowned.

As he had expected, Ni Guang and that grim fellow had also joined the pursuit, separated from him by several thousand li.

Longer nights breed more trouble — if Yang Kai were to link up with the two behind him, matters would become troublesome.

At that thought, Zi Long suddenly opened his mouth and slowly exhaled.

With that breath a shuttle‑shaped Secret Treasure materialized.

"What is that..." Zi Donglai seemed to see it for the first time and his eyes gleamed.

Xu Wei frowned; with all his experience he could not tell what it was.

If Yang Kai were here he would be astonished.

For the thing looked markedly similar to the small warship of the Lingxiao Sect.

Back then Yang Yan had not only refined a Void King‑Grade warship but had paired it with a smaller shuttle‑shaped warship, which also took a shuttle form.

"Skybreaking Shuttle!" Zi Long said calmly. "A predecessor of Purple Star obtained its forging method from the Great Emperor tens of thousands of years ago — the method was limited, so only one was forged and it has some flaws, but for pursuing this brat it should be more than enough. All aboard!"

As he spoke, Zi Long waved his hand, causing the shuttle to open to the wind and in the blink of an eye stretch to a length of three zhang.

A hidden door appeared on the shuttle, and the three entered in single file.

Inside, Xu Wei and Zi Donglai watched in wonder and discovered the shuttle's interior was engraved with many abstruse formations, each embedded with numerous Upper‑Level Saint Crystals.

"Xu Wei, take charge of this formation!" Zi Long pointed and instructed him.

"Please, Zi Long, kindly instruct this old servant — how should I proceed..." Xu Wei asked.

"Sit on the formation and pour Saint Yuan into it," Zi Long explained.

"This old servant understands." Xu Wei immediately flashed to the formation and sat cross‑legged, but before he could pour Saint Yuan into it his face changed and he groaned.

In that instant the formation actively began to draw his Saint Yuan, and it did so at great speed.

This caused his complexion to change drastically.

Instinctively he wanted to leap back out, but when he met Zi Long's cold gaze his head shrank and he sat back down.

A dragon begets a dragon, a phoenix begets a phoenix — and a rat’s son also knows how to dig holes…

Those father and son truly were no good! Xu Wei's heart was tormented by countless wounds, miserable to behold...

No wonder Zi Long had said the shuttle had flaws: it required drawing a martial artist's Saint Yuan to operate, and judging by the formation's power an ordinary fighter could not withstand it; even a Void King Realm like himself might not be able to endure long before his Saint Yuan ran dry.

"Donglai, sit here." Zi Long pointed to another formation and said to Zi Donglai.

"Yes, father." Zi Donglai had no hesitation and sat upon the other formation.

Zi Long selected the third formation for himself.

The three sat cross‑legged within the Skybreaking Shuttle, the formations flared wide, and in an instant the shuttle hummed and surged forward.

Its speed was certainly far faster than Zi Long flying; it seemed to rend the void as it rushed onward, truly living up to the shuttle's name.

"Ha ha — brat, let's see where you can run to now!" Zi Donglai laughed; after sitting on the formation and circulating Saint Yuan he found himself linked tightly to the shuttle and could sense Yang Kai's position clearly, overjoyed at the prospect of watching Yang Kai flee in humiliation.
