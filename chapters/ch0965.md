## Chapter 965 — One Old, One Young

Lei Long, the Great Lord, spoke in a somewhat sour tone; Yang Kai glanced at him and instantly understood—Lei Long likely fancied that yao woman—and, adopting a solemn mien, said, "Enough of that, speak of the matter at hand."

The three Great Lords' expressions likewise turned serious in an instant.

"Words alone won't convince; the three of you should see for yourselves!" Yang Kai said in a deep voice.

"See for ourselves?" Lei Long raised an eyebrow, somewhat puzzled as to what Yang Kai wanted them to witness.

"If you trust me, lower the defenses of your Seas of Consciousness." Yang Kai said as he gathered a pale white sphere of light at his fingertip; the orb emitted his soul's aura, clearly a fragment of his memory.

The three yao Great Lords exchanged glances and all nodded.

Only then did Yang Kai press his finger to each of their foreheads and inject the memory-bearing soul energy into their Seas of Consciousness.

All three Great Lords' bodies trembled slightly, and then they slowly closed their eyes, carefully examining the information Yang Kai had transmitted.

Those memories included not only everything he had seen within Demon Capital, but also the scenes Yang Kai witnessed inside the Water Divine Hall.

After a long while, the three Great Lords slowly opened their eyes, their faces extremely grave.

They all came to a deep understanding of how troublesome the Bone Clan truly was.

"I didn't expect this matter to be tied to the Great Demon God," Lei Long murmured.

"Moreover, our yao ancestors once fought those visitors from beyond the stars!" Yu'er frowned slightly. "But why is there no record? Almost all our predecessors perished in those battles; such glorious deeds should have been recorded."

"Above the Saint Realm lies the Saint King Realm? Through history only the Great Demon God reached such a realm?" the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox bellowed. "It's almost unbelievable!"

"What do you propose we do?" Lei Long asked Yang Kai solemnly.

"Help!" Yang Kai was concise. "From my observation, the Bone Clan currently has no Saint King Realm experts; their strongest are only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, and there are only a few. The most worrisome thing is their ability to create new kin through that special method."

"They seem invincible, but they are not. If humans, yao, and demons can join forces, gathering all the continent's experts for a concerted strike, wiping them out would be no great difficulty."

Lei Long nodded. "If we move, we must do so quickly; the longer we delay, the more unfavorable it becomes for us."

"I agree."

"Old Ox and Yu'er, what do you think?" Lei Long cast his gaze to the other two Great Lords. "After all, this concerns the whole yao; one person cannot decide alone."

"Follow your lead!" Yu'er deferred the decision to Lei Long. The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox shrugged indifferently.

Lei Long grinned broadly. "Changyuan has already intervened. How can our yao remain uninvolved? If this becomes public later, won't people mock us? We'll take part."

Yang Kai's spirits lifted and he nodded heavily. "Good. I knew Lei Long is reasonable."

Lei Long shook his head. "This isn't about helping you; it's about our own survival. Tongxuan Continent isn't the bones' domain — it is ours."

Once the three Great Lords agreed, they immediately began summoning yao experts.

The Beast Sea Great Forest is not far from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; once assembled, they could quickly rendezvous with Yang Kai, certainly faster than the demons.

With both yao and demons having declared their intervention, Yang Kai felt a touch disheartened that the major human powers had so far sent few replies.

Except for those forces closely allied with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land or with Yang Kai, most maintained an attitude of watching and waiting.

They assumed the situation wasn't too severe and that even if disaster spread, it wouldn't touch them.

Those ambiguous stances infuriated Elder Xu Hui, who cursed constantly, yet he was powerless to change them.

One day, an old man and a young man drifted to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; the elder was white-haired, his bearing transcendent and austere, while the youth was rosy-lipped, white-toothed, handsome enough to shame many women who begrudged such beauty in a man.

"Master, we've arrived." The handsome youth gazed at the Nine Peaks and drew a deep breath. "That fellow is doing well—holding so much precious land."

The elder stroked his beard and smiled. "No need to envy others; you and I, master and disciple, have also gained much traveling the world."

"Master is right." The youth bowed respectfully. "But Master, why did you suddenly want to come here?"

The elder chuckled. "I heard there's a master alchemist here; I wished to take a look."

“What alchemy master could possibly compare to you, Master?” the young man sneered, clearly dismissive. Then his expression suddenly grew solemn, as though muttering to himself: “Master must just not want to embarrass the human race, right?”

"If you already know, why speak?" the elder sighed. "The world's situation is worrying; how many can this young man rally? The demons and yao have moved, yet humans remain divided. I've been secluded long; it's time I showed my face."

"I knew it—this is Master's intention!" the youth chuckled, as if he'd long seen through him.

"Hm, there are disciples guarding the mountain; go inform them." The elder waved at the youth, who hurried forward and relayed a few words to the mountain-guarding Sacred Land disciple.

That disciple replied quickly, "Please wait a moment; I will report to the Great Elder at once!"

In the Saint Lord Courtyard, inside the alchemy chamber, Yang Kai was refining pills with Little Senior Sister and five masters when sudden footsteps sounded outside.

Frowning, Yang Kai set down his tools and quietly left the room.

Outside, Xu Hui was waiting.

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked.

"Someone requests an audience outside."

"Who?"

"According to the reporting disciples, the visitor claims to be Zhai Yao!"

"Zhai Yao?" Yang Kai's body shivered; he hastily asked, "Did he come alone, or accompanied by an elder?"

Xu Hui was taken aback, not understanding Yang Kai's agitation, and hurriedly replied, "It seems there is indeed an old man with him."

Hardly had he spoken when Yang Kai rushed toward the Nine Peaks like a gust of wind.

Xu Hui scratched his head, perplexed.

He had never seen Yang Kai so eager to personally receive a guest; as the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's reputation grew, few deserved the Saint Lord's personal reception.

Who exactly was Zhai Yao to warrant such regard from the Saint Lord?

Still uncertain, Yang Kai dashed back at speed.

Xu Hui stared in astonishment. "Saint Lord, you—"

Before he could finish, Yang Kai brushed past him and charged into the alchemy room; moments later the masters' angry shouts rang out: "You ruined my furnace of pills—if you don't give a reasonable explanation, I won't let it go."

"My pills were ruined too—what a waste of those Saint-Grade ingredients!"

"Good heavens, you brat, what do you think you're doing, plundering the heavens' treasures!"

"Don't drag me. I'm going to refine pills here. I'm not leaving."

"I won't see anyone! I won't see anyone!"

"Exactly—what visitor could be more important than pill refinement?"

"Besides, does Zhai Yao even have the qualifications for us old fellows to see him? If not, tell him to take a hike!"

The masters clamored angrily; they were clearly displeased at Yang Kai interrupting their alchemy.

Xu Hui vaguely heard Yang Kai mutter something under his breath.

Inside, the masters' bickering abruptly stopped as if they'd been silenced, leaving a complete hush.

Xu Hui thought he even heard rapid heartbeats coming from within the chamber.

Immediately, the five masters burst from the chamber, each wearing a look of fanatic reverence as they scrambled out.

The corpulent Chang Bao's flesh trembled in waves, yet he refused to be outdone, running faster than a rabbit; using his bulk he shoved the other masters aside and surged ahead.

Xu Hui stood stupefied.

He had never seen these famed masters behave so out of sorts.

"Masters, slow down!" Xu Hui managed to warn, but they had already vanished.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang also hurried past him.

"What on earth is happening?" Xu Hui was baffled.

Outside the Nine Peaks, when Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang arrived, they found the five masters clustered around a white-haired elder, their faces full of worshipful frenzy as they spoke to him with restraint.

Chang Bao wiped his brow and beamed like a blossom, as if he had received the elder's praise; his face flushed with excitement.

"Brother Yang!" the youth beside the elder called to Yang Kai from afar.

"Brother Zhai!" Yang Kai greeted warmly. "Long time no see."

"Yes, it's been nearly ten years since we left Fuyun City. Huh..." Zhai Yao trailed off, suddenly fixing his gaze on Xia Ningshang and exclaiming, "Aren't you that girl? What are you doing here?"

"This is my Senior Sister, Xia Ningshang!"

"Senior Sister..." Zhai Yao's expression froze, then he suddenly recalled, "So you've finally found her? How wonderful, congratulations."

"Thank you, Brother Zhai." Yang Kai smiled and stepped forward to bow respectfully to the elder. "Junior pays respects to Elder Li!"

Xia Ningshang also offered a graceful salute.

“There’s no need for courtesy, Young Friend Yang.” Elder Li smiled and nodded. “It is this old man who has come uninvited—Young Friend Yang won’t hold it against me, will you?”

"Elder Li honors me. For Elder Li and Brother Zhai to come to the Sacred Land is my honor—how could I complain? Please, come inside," Yang Kai gestured.

Elder Li smiled and, escorted by the five masters, strolled into the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The mountain-guarding disciples watched in amazement, eyes nearly popping out; they could not fathom who this old and young pair were to command such reverence from the five masters and even the Saint Lord, and they were full of suspicion.
