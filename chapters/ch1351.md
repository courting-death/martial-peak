## Chapter 1351 — Roadblock

The Secret Treasure guarding her was shattered, the old woman's wizened body was laid bare in the giant puppet's hand, and as that hand tightened the sickening crunch of breaking bones rang out, making one's skin crawl.

After struggling for a moment, the old woman realized with a chill that she could not escape the predicament by her own strength; a flash of terror and astonishment passed through the depths of her eyes as she turned to Yang Kai and the others and cried, "Save me!"

No sooner had the words fallen than a muffled pop sounded.

The old woman suddenly exploded, blood spraying in all directions; her head tumbled from the air, her eyes still fixed with disbelief and an utter unwillingness to accept her fate.

Though she had long been on guard against this humanoid statue, she never imagined that it was not some trap or mechanism but a real puppet!

Worse still, it moved without any master to drive it — entirely against common sense.

If Lian Guang had been present he might have discerned some clue, but none of the four standing here understood the way of puppets; none had expected such constructs to exist within this ancient ruin.

And this puppet was no ordinary one — it could crush a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioner with a single grip, its ferocity plain to see.

At the instant the old woman died, a look of resolve flickered in Yang Kai's eyes; fixating on the round gate beneath its crotch, he surged forward. Whatever purpose the puppet guarded, Yang Kai did not wish to tangle with it — he only wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

He moved swiftly, but the puppet's reaction was equally rapid. After crushing the crone its crimson eyes turned to the charging Yang Kai, and an overwhelmingly dangerous aura descended. Yang Kai's face changed; as he forced his Divine Sense, the Purple Shield he had already deployed poured forth great winds and sands, forming a sandstorm that surrounded and protected his body, while his Saint Yuan also stirred to form a firm defense outside him.

Through the haze Yang Kai saw a flash of light on the giant puppet's hand, and then a thick shadow came crashing toward him.

Before it struck, Yang Kai felt his breathing constrict, as if that shadow had engulfed the entire world, giving rise to a hopeless, inescapable dread.

Gritting his teeth, he drove the Purple Shield's power to its limit, and with his Saint Yuan bolstered a solid protection formed around him.

With a thunderous boom and spray of wind and sand, the sandstorm power attached to the Purple Shield could not withstand that blow and was shattered. The shield itself flashed and was hurled far away by the force; in the next instant Yang Kai felt his protective Saint Yuan collapse, his body convulsed, and he was flung backward, face-up, uncontrollably.

Qi and blood churned; a mouthful of pale golden blood spouted from his mouth and became a plume of blood mist.

With a rumble, Yang Kai was blasted over a hundred zhang before his body struck a flowerbed, smashing it to pieces as he landed in a pitiful state.

Even now he could not see precisely what had attacked him; only that a thick shadow had swept in — all his resistance and defenses had been in vain.

Collapsing amid the ruined flowerbed, Yang Kai coughed up several more mouthfuls of blood; after catching his breath he forced himself to stand, still shaken as he looked toward that place.

He had never suffered such a humiliating setback; the frustration and gloom in his heart were obvious.

Had the Purple Shield not intercepted the blow he would have been far worse off; even so, his internal organs had been jolted out of place and agony coursed through every part of his body, as if he were falling apart.

The experience left him both shocked and enraged!

He lifted his eyes; upon seeing the situation before him his expression went blank.

The puppet still stood unmoved, as if it had never budged. Cai He and Du Sisi, some ten zhang before it, were ashen and dazed, staring up at this awe-inspiring presence; yet the puppet paid them no heed and showed no intention of attacking.

Before the puppet, a gigantic staff stood upright, now gripped in its enormous palm.

Calling it a staff was inadequate — it was a ferocious staff-type Secret Treasure, jet-black throughout, its material unknown, some ten-odd zhang long and as thick as a water bucket, a truly terrifying sight.

Yang Kai immediately understood: the shadow that had struck him a moment ago was that black giant staff.

Where had this thing come from? A flicker of astonished doubt crossed Yang Kai's eyes. The puppet had no such item before, though when he had tried to dash through the round gate he had vaguely seen a flash on the puppet's hand — could it have drawn the staff then?

Even across a hundred zhang Yang Kai could feel the oppressive aura radiating from the giant staff. Strange characters had been inscribed upon it — the same kind the group had seen upon entering this ancient ruin — none of them could identify what they were.

Coughing a few times and spitting blood, Yang Kai stared at the puppet in a daze; finding it showed no sign of pursuit, a small relief washed over him.

It was only now that Cai He and Du Sisi seemed to recover; Cai He trembled as he looked at Du Sisi and whispered, "Sisi, fall back!"

Du Sisi's pretty face had gone deathly pale, as if she had not recovered from the shock of the old woman's death. At his words she glanced at Cai He and two tears slid uncontrollably from the corners of her eyes.

She was terrified.

Though she had faced danger before, nothing had shaken her as much as this. She had watched the old woman be crushed into a mist of blood; the crone's head still lay on the ground, eyes wide and staring in her direction as if to reproach her for failing to save her.

So great a blow to her spirit left her completely undone, utterly at a loss.

Even at Cai He's warning she could not step back for fear that any movement would result in her being struck down.

Seeing this, Cai He was frantic; although the puppet appeared merely to guard the exit, who could say it would not suddenly strike? He did not wish to see the woman he admired die before him and meet the old woman's fate.

In his urgency Cai He darted to Du Sisi's side, grabbed her, and without looking back raced toward the way they had come.

Only when they reached Yang Kai did Cai He collapse, drained of strength by the short retreat of a hundred zhang; he was deathly pale, his teeth chattering with a cracking sound.

Du Sisi was no better; the fright had shattered her composure, her beautiful eyes overflowing with panic and horror.

Though the old woman had been only a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, while alive she had been a pillar of support. With her death only three Saint King Realm practitioners remained, leaving Du Sisi feeling bereft of someone to rely upon and utterly unmoored.

Yang Kai's face was dark and terrible; he had yet to recover from being struck by that giant staff. Only because he possessed Golden Blood and strong regenerative ability could he stand — had anyone else taken that blow they would likely need months to recuperate.

He swallowed several Healing Pills and sat cross-legged to recuperate.

For now he had to stabilize his injuries; as for how to leave this place, that would require longer consideration.

Half a day later Yang Kai opened his eyes and silently checked his condition.

Though his wounds had not fully healed, they were not serious enough to prevent action. After half a day's rest Cai He and Du Sisi were much improved, though Du Sisi's eyes remained swollen and red and she looked listless.

Cai He was not as badly off, but a trace of despair and helplessness still showed in his eyes.

After all, that puppet had dispatched the old woman with a single strike; with it guarding the round gate Cai He did not believe they could safely pass.

Yang Kai glanced at them and frowned, saying nothing. With a gesture the Purple Shield that had been struck away returned as a streak of light. Examining it, he found a dent and two finger-width cracks on its surface — a severe loss to its spirit.

He could not help but feel a lingering dread. That Purple Shield had been refined twice by Yang Yan and had reached Origin-Grade Upper-Level; as their main defensive Secret Treasure its sturdiness was beyond doubt.

Even so, after taking a blow from that jet-black giant staff it had been reduced to such a state — one could imagine how terrifying the force of that strike had been.

He gave a slight sigh, put the Purple Shield away intending to have Yang Yan repair it later, then rose and stared at the giant puppet a hundred zhang away. After a long moment he set off toward it with a grave expression.

"Brother Yang..." Cai He called, his expression changing as he hurriedly shouted, "What are you going to do?"

"To test its capabilities!" Yang Kai answered, turning back.

"Test it..." Cai He was stunned. "Isn't that a bit too rash?"

Seeing the old woman dead at its hands, Cai He naturally had little faith in Yang Kai; the disparity between Yang Kai and the woman was great — it could be like a meat bun striking a dog, a one-way trip.

“Can you not mess around?” Du Sisi, whose eyes had been dull and lifeless, suddenly jolted awake and screamed, “It finally calmed down—why are you trying to provoke it again? Do you want all of us to die here?”

Yang Kai gave her a cold glance.

Du Sisi's gaze immediately darted away; she seemed unwilling to meet his eyes and nervously protested, "That senior is already dead — if you die too, what will become of me and Cai He?"

Though she considered herself superior and scorned peers, in the present situation the more people there were the safer she felt. Her concern was not so much for Yang Kai as for the fact that any further casualties on their side would diminish her sense of security.

Yang Kai said coldly, "Then in your opinion, what should we do?"

Du Sisi immediately went meek and had no good suggestions.
