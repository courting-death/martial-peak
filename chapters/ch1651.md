## Chapter 1651 — Slap in the Face

"Want someone? What sort of person?" Luo Li frowned, her dark brows knitting. "Ice Heart Valley should not have the person Chi Huo seeks."

“That’s true enough—your sect indeed has no one I’m looking for. However…” Chi Huo said up to this point, then beckoned with a wave of his hand toward someone behind him. “You little brat, step forward and speak for yourself. This matter concerns you, after all.”

Wei Feng’s eyes lit up and he hurried out from behind Chi Huo, first offering a perfunctory bow to Luo Hai and Luo Li to put on airs, then straightening his spine. Just as he opened his mouth, he suddenly felt an icy gaze fixed on his face.

That stare was like a sharp sword, piercing Wei Feng’s spirit; his face drained of color and he swallowed hard.

He couldn’t force a single word out.

Following that gaze, Wei Feng saw Luo Li watching him with an unfriendly expression, her eyes frigid. She did not need to exert any force; that single pure look plunged him as if into an ice cellar, as though he stood at the edge of an abyss ten thousand zhang deep, the surrounding chill threatening to swallow him whole.

Wei Feng’s calves trembled uncontrollably, his throat making choking noises; his eyes overflowed with panic.

Bing Long and many of the elders felt a jolt in their hearts and instinctively glanced at Su Yan.

The moment Wei Feng stepped forward, they realized Chi Huo’s scheme — their hearts tightened, and each felt an unpleasant sense of foreboding.

The Sect Master of the Fire Radiance Sect’s son had long had designs on Su Yan; the dispute that broke out a year ago was precisely because the Fire Radiance Sect used Su Yan as an excuse to demand Ice Heart Valley hand her over.

Ice Heart Valley’s people were perfectly aware of what sort of character Wei Feng was.

To put it bluntly, if Wei Feng had not been born into a great sect like the Fire Radiance Sect, if he were not the son of Wei Qing, he might never in his life have broken through to the Saint King Realm.

Even possessing countless natural advantages, relying on many elixirs and Saint Crystals stacked upon one another, his cultivation had only been pushed up to the Origin Returning Realm.

He could not even form his own Shi!

He might well be the only Origin Returning Realm cultivator in the entire Star Domain without his own Shi — a laughingstock before the world.

Wei Feng’s aptitude was plainly dreadful; one need only glimpse it to know.

Compared to him, Su Yan was the very favored daughter of heaven and earth. The two should never have crossed paths.

Yet during one of Su Yan’s excursions for training, she was accidentally encountered by Wei Feng, who was instantly awed by her beauty as though seeing a celestial being, and became determined to make her his own.

The Fire Radiance Sect seized upon this incident and made a great fuss.

Wei Feng’s temperament was indeed vile, but as Wei Qing’s son his background was not low. The Fire Radiance Sect considered Wei Feng’s interest in Su Yan to be a boon for her...

Chi Huo had brought Wei Feng to Ice Heart Valley this time, and had him step forward to speak — his intent needed no explanation.

Yet this ugly wretch had been cowed nearly senseless by a single glance from the Grand Elder, and could not even speak properly.

Chi Huo’s face darkened; Wei Feng’s performance had utterly shamed the Fire Radiance Sect. In anger he kicked out, nearly sending Wei Feng sprawling.

"Useless thing! With me to vouch for you, what’s there to fear? Speak up and let me see if you’re even a man!"

Chi Huo roared loudly.

As if provoked by Chi Huo’s scolding or reassured by his guarantee, Wei Feng suddenly swelled with courage. His face flushing, he gritted his teeth and pointed at Su Yan. "I want this woman called Su Yan!"

The elders of Ice Heart Valley showed identical expressions of fury.

Ran Yunting’s face went cold as stone.

The smile on Yang Kai’s face faded, his gaze turning icy as he fixed Wei Feng with a cold stare, the corner of his mouth lifting in a subtle, dangerous curve.

From the moment he entered this ice chamber, Yang Kai had noticed the timid fellow repeatedly glancing at Su Yan. He had not paid it much mind — Su Yan was born radiant, and naturally drew male attention. But when Wei Feng uttered those words, Yang Kai understood: the man did not merely glance; he intended to possess her.

Killing intent surged in Yang Kai’s heart. He looked at Wei Feng with the same expression Wei Feng had earlier used to regard him.

As if staring at a corpse.

Su Yan shifted her beautiful eyes then, her brows knitting as she regarded Wei Feng with suspicion.

It seemed she only now roused from her reverie; until this moment her thoughts had been entirely on Yang Kai, and the outside world had not disturbed her.

"You?" Su Yan recognized Wei Feng and said indifferently, "What, wasn’t the lesson you received last time enough? You still want to ask for another beating?"

Her calm words made Wei Feng leap like a frightened rabbit; he hurried back behind Chi Huo, seeking safety.

Wei Feng’s behavior was utterly shameful; Chi Huo felt his face redden like a burnished pan, mortified.

Even Luo Hai, who had been watching from the sidelines, shook his head slowly.

"You know him?" Yang Kai asked.

Su Yan shook her head. "Not really. Last time he spoke rude words and I broke a few of his ribs — turns out he’s from the Fire Radiance Sect. No wonder he’s so despicable."

She sighed and added, "If I’d known, I would have killed him outright."

"Next time, don’t hold back." Yang Kai patted the back of Su Yan’s hand.

Su Yan smiled and nodded lightly.

"You... you have a lot of nerve!" Though timid and useless, Wei Feng felt anger welling up; he had been obsessed with Su Yan, nearly haunted by her, and she did not even know his name.

It seemed she certainly didn’t know who he was.

Wei Feng felt wounded — she was so intimate with that bastard man, had completely ignored him before; it was an unbearable humiliation.

“Just you remember this—once you’ve married me, I’ll make sure you learn how formidable I am!” Wei Feng declared with firm conviction.

"Courting death!" A cold light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes and he suddenly swept his hand toward Wei Feng.

A distinct Saint Yuan palm manifested, appearing like a storm as it surged toward Wei Feng; the Saint Yuan palm contained terrifying destructive force.

Wei Feng was stunned with fear, trembling all over, his face pale as he shouted, "Grand Elder, save me!"

"How bold of you, making a move in front of me!" Chi Huo snorted coldly and reached out; with a grasp in midair, the Saint Yuan palm shattered into pieces under his hold.

At that moment, from within the burst energy, a subtle distortion of force writhed and formed into a sword-like shard that suddenly shot out, catching everyone off guard — it entered Wei Feng’s left cheek and exited through his right.

Chi Huo’s face changed dramatically!

Luo Hai raised an eyebrow and glanced at Yang Kai in surprise.

Luo Li’s beautiful eyes gleamed, and she gave a slight nod.

The three of them saw clearly it was not that Yang Kai had hidden some secret strike inside the Saint Yuan palm, but that his control over his Saint Yuan had reached mastery — even after Chi Huo shattered the palm, Yang Kai could rapidly recombine it into a lethal form.

Such a strike normally would not be terribly powerful; even with Wei Feng’s ability, defending should have been easy.

Yet Wei Feng’s performance had been so pitiful he failed to notice, and was struck by that force.

Blood gushed from both cheeks; only now did Wei Feng feel the searing pain, his cheeks burning as a subtle power seeped through the wounds into his flesh.

He howled in agony, clutching both sides of his face, tears and snot streaming, a sight unbearable to look upon.

The elders of Ice Heart Valley all shook their heads slowly, obvious contempt and disgust on their faces.

Such a man dared to covet Su Yan? Compared to him, Yang Kai seemed towering and boundless; he and Su Yan were truly a match made by heaven.

Chi Huo’s face turned an ugly mix of blue and white as he stared at Yang Kai with a low voice squeezed from his throat like a rabid beast: "Boy, you’re dead!"

Having Wei Feng’s cheek pierced in front of him wasn’t only Wei Feng’s humiliation.

Chi Huo himself had been slapped in the face — the Fire Radiance Sect had been slapped!

Chi Huo could no longer bear it.

Like a coiled lion unleashed, an unimaginable terrifying aura roared from Chi Huo’s body, changing the color of Ice Heart Valley’s people’s faces.

Yang Kai, however, remained calm and indifferent, looking at the red-haired elder with a mocking smile at the corner of his mouth.

"Chi Huo!" Luo Hai said sharply, frowning. "Do your business!"

He would not allow Chi Huo to kill Yang Kai. Chi Huo was using his prestige to pressure Ice Heart Valley; he was willing to turn a blind eye so long as Chi Huo did not pry into Yang Kai’s secrets.

But if Chi Huo tried to lay a hand on Yang Kai, Luo Hai would not stand idly by.

Until he uncovered the secrets Yang Kai possessed, no one was allowed to attack him.

Hearing this, the aura inside Chi Huo’s body was doused as if with a bucket of cold water; it instantly died down. He seemed to realize something, but only glared coldly at Yang Kai with ill intent.

“Grand Elder, uphold justice for me! Kill him, kill him! I beg the Grand Elder to stand up for me!” Wei Feng wailed miserably as he shouted, completely lacking any sense of the situation.

Chi Huo drew a deep breath, his chest heaving violently.

Why on earth had he brought such rubbish to Ice Heart Valley?

At this moment he wanted nothing more than to slap Wei Feng into mince.

He resolved that once they returned, he would imprison Wei Feng within the Fire Radiance Sect forever, never to let him out; wherever he went, he would ruin the sect’s face.

That the Fire Radiance Sect had produced such a creature was an affront to the gods!

"Shut up!" Chi Huo said curtly.

Wei Feng’s wailing halted abruptly; he dared not disobey the Grand Elder, though the piercing pain twisted his expression and the crimson blood made him look ghastly and terrifying.

He covered his cheeks, his gaze darting about as none dared meet his eyes; finally he fixed on the ground beneath his feet, saying nothing.

"Boy, you have guts. Since Luo Hai brother wishes to shelter you, I won’t make a scene over this. If you must thank someone, thank Luo Hai!" Chi Huo said sourly, then looked up at Luo Li and spoke: "You know why I’ve come; my worthless junior has set his eye on this young lady — I hope she will come back to the Fire Radiance Sect with me!"
