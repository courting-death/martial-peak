## Chapter 1377 — Xuan Gold

Resting upon the jade plate was, astonishingly, a fist-sized piece of unknown ore, its surface uneven and pitted, its entire body gleaming with a crimson-gold hue!

What shocked everyone was that runes flowed across the surface of the ore—clearly a master had laid a sealing restriction to block its breath from leaking out. Even so, every person in attendance at the auction could clearly feel sharp, swordlike qi stabbing forth from the stone.

If it already gives off that much with a sealing restriction in place, what would happen if the seal were removed?

Martial artists whose strength was even slightly lower could forget about getting near this ore!

This was no ordinary object; only a very few would recognize it. All present only knew that something like this was an extraordinarily rare treasure. No wonder Jubao Tower had placed it toward the end of the auction—this was effectively the finale piece.

“Good, good, good! Hahaha! This Jin has searched in vain for most of his life, never finding it—and to think I would behold it here today! Jubao Tower truly lives up to its name, gathering the treasures of the world!” From the A-Class private room of the Demon Blood Sect, the expert named Jin Shi burst into hearty laughter, clearly delighted with the ore and intent on claiming it for himself.

“You want this?” In room B-13, Yang Yan shot a suspicious glance at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s emotions were plainly stirred; Yang Yan could see through his intentions.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Yang Yan made a soft sound of acknowledgment and did not ask Yang Kai what he intended to do with it.

On hearing this, the young woman Qing’er also displayed a trace of joy at the corner of her brow, but she quickly grew concerned and said, “But Elder, Elder Jin from the Demon Blood Sect seems to want it as well.”

“Auctions are auctions; the highest bidder wins!” Yang Kai grinned. He had brought seventy million Saint Crystals this time and was not afraid of being outbid by Jin Shi. After all, the Demon Blood Sect had already bid several times in previous auctions and spent no small amount.

Qing’er bowed her head submissively and said, “Then I wish Elder a triumphant victory!”

“Let’s hope your good words bring luck!” Yang Kai grinned. Naturally, he understood why the young girl was so nervous—it was because if he took part in the bidding and successfully won an item, she, as the attendant assigned to serve him, would receive certain rewards from Jubao Tower. Those rewards were directly proportional to the price paid. Up until now, he had remained inactive, purchasing nothing, so the girl had earned no reward. But if he were to buy this item, the compensation Jubao Tower would grant her would be enough to keep her well off for quite some time.

This matter was something Qing’er herself had mentioned; Yang Kai had never deliberately inquired. The young girl served him with great care and attentiveness, so naturally, Yang Kai did not mind letting her gain a bit of benefit.

“Pardon this old man’s poor eyesight, but just what in the world is that damned thing? Old Jin, why are you losing your composure like this?” A voice came from another private room—judging from his words, it seemed he did not recognize the ore.

It wasn’t that the man was ignorant—the Star Domain contained countless materials, and this ore was extremely rare. One would never see it at ordinary times. Only those who cultivated special techniques requiring this ore would pay it any heed.

Only a freak like Yang Yan treated every material as though she knew them all by heart, but such people were rare.

“Heh heh, Elder Jin’s excitement is only natural—this Xuan Gold is of great benefit to the Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art that Elder Jin cultivates. With such Xuan Gold as an aid, Elder Jin’s mastery is surely imminent!” Ren Tianrui, as if fearing others wouldn’t know the ore’s background, casually explained.

“Xuan Gold?” The man who had spoken earlier seemed to recall something at that name and involuntarily exclaimed.

“Ren boy, auction what you will—what need have you to drag my Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art into this?” Jin Shi was greatly enraged. He naturally saw through Ren Tianrui’s malicious intent. Were this anywhere else, he would have already struck to teach the man a lesson. But since this was Jubao Tower, even though fury burned in his heart, he had no choice but to restrain himself. Yet with that single remark, Ren Tianrui had made it far more difficult for him to secure the Xuan Gold—for the Demon Blood Sect had many enemies, and those people would never stand idly by and watch him obtain the Xuan Gold and bring his demonic art to perfection.

“Please calm down, Elder, please calm down—this junior spoke out of turn!” Ren Tianrui, realizing his mistake, bowed anxiously.

But words once spoken cannot be taken back; beneath his fearful demeanor a trace of glee flashed in Ren Tianrui’s eyes. For Jubao Tower, it mattered little who bought the Xuan Gold so long as it fetched a high price.

“Enough chatter, start the auction!” Jin Shi growled impatiently.

“Yes!” Ren Tianrui smiled and, pointing with his folded fan at the Xuan Gold, announced in a clear voice, “One superior piece of Xuan Gold, weighing one jin three liang, starting price five million Saint Crystals, each raise no less than one hundred thousand—begin the bidding!”

“Ten million!” The instant Ren Tianrui finished, Jin Shi’s voice rose, doubling the price and showing his resolve and boldness to obtain the Xuan Gold.

Since his need for the Xuan Gold was no secret, he bid lavishly without hiding his hand.

“Ten million one hundred thousand!” Mo Xiaosheng of the Battle Sky Alliance chuckled as he spoke, saying the Xuan Gold would fit his Golden Bone Shield perfectly.

“Ten million five hundred thousand from me to join the fun.” Cheng Pengxuan of Leitai Sect was not to be outdone.

“Eleven million!” A hoarse voice came from another room, and judging by it the speaker was an old woman.

“Twelve million!”

……

In the Demon Blood Sect’s room, Jin Shi’s face turned ashen and his expression grew extremely ugly. Though he knew the Demon Blood Sect had many enemies and that obtaining the Xuan Gold would be difficult, he had not expected five or six people to respond the moment he bid. None of those five or six were beneath him in status; their cultivation was not weak compared to his. Even if he tried to bully them by force, it wouldn’t work. His anger flared and he roared, “Twenty million!”

“Brother Jin, bold indeed, but do you think you can get this with a mere twenty million? Are you asleep? I raise to twenty-five million!” The old woman sneered and raised the price by five million.

That price held for only the briefest of breaths before being surpassed by an even higher bid.

It was no wonder—the Xuan Gold was simply too rare. Ren Tianrui had not exaggerated when introducing it; such material appeared but once in ten thousand years. Whether used for forging or for cultivating special techniques, its benefits were immense.

For a time, bidding calls rose and fell in the auction hall, and the increments terrified many. People thought to themselves that these Saint Crystals could ensure the development of a small sect or family, yet they fought fiercely over a single piece of material.

In room B-13, Yang Kai remained silent and did not join the contest; he knew the price was not yet the final one and chose not to waste effort, waiting for his rivals to exhaust themselves.

“Forty million!” Jin Shi’s voice sounded again. The auction for the Xuan Gold had surged, though it was far from over. After shouting that price, Jin Shi added, “Friends, this Xuan Gold is of great use to me. If any of you generously yield it, I will remember it and personally come to thank you in the future.”

By now no one had backed down, and Jin Shi’s heart pounded as the price climbed beyond his expectations. He had to speak.

At his words, the calls from the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect ceased as Cheng Pengxuan and Mo Xiaosheng weighed the pros and cons.

After a while, Mo Xiaosheng laughed and said loudly, “Since Brother Jin has said so, I shall withdraw. Honestly, no artificer can fully refine such a material; applying it to my Golden Bone Shield would be wasteful.”

Immediately, several other powerful bidders indicated they would withdraw—not merely out of respect for Jin Shi’s face, but because everyone saw Jin Shi’s determination. Continuing the fight would only let Jubao Tower profit more. Ren Tianrui, standing on the auction stand with his mouth nearly split to his ears, would do well to stop now and do Jin Shi a favor.

Besides, even if they bought this piece of Xuan Gold, it would be of little use to them. Though its grade was exceedingly high, without an artificer capable of drawing out its potential, what good was its quality?

Seeing this, Jin Shi’s chest eased and he thanked them profusely.

“Hmph! Old Ghost Jin, you may have great use for this Profound Gold, but do you think this old woman is buying it just for amusement? Forty-one million!” The old crone’s voice rang out once again, showing not the slightest regard for Jin Shi’s face.

“Old hag Feng, to what use do you intend the Xuan Gold? If you do not explain yourself, I will not let this drop!” Jin Shi flew into a rage. Others were easy to deal with, but this old hag Feng contending with him was intolerable.

“You think this old woman would be afraid of you?” Feng Pozi seemed to have quite the temper herself; hearing his threat, she immediately snapped back in retort.

Across the two A-Class rooms, the pressure rolled like waves as Third Stage experts of the Origin Returning Realm bristled, swords almost drawn—there seemed little between them and a fight.

“Both of you, this is Jubao Tower—please restrain yourselves!” A faint voice sounded in the void. At hearing it, Madam Feng and Jin Shi’s expressions shifted; they seemed to recall something and immediately toned down their airs.

Only then did the warriors in the hall breathe deeply, faces still pale with lingering dread.

Ren Tianrui on the stand wiped a cold sweat; though Jubao Tower’s auctions rarely had mishaps, if these two truly fought it would not end easily. After a moment, he said, “Elder Jin, do not be angry—since Elder Feng has joined the bidding, she must have a use for it.”

“What use?” Jin Shi snorted coldly, not easily convinced.

Ren Tianrui smiled faintly and said, “As far as I know, the Golden Lion Thunder-pattern Beast that has been with Elder Feng for half a lifetime should be due to advance in rank, right?”
