## Chapter 1475 — Lin Yun'er

“You've had a hard time these years.” Yang Kai sighed softly. “Where is the person you mentioned?”

He saw no trace of anyone here.

“Here she is.” Huang Juan smiled, producing a small figure from behind her. She crouched down with a gentle look and said, “Yun'er, come and pay respects to Sect Master Yang!”

Yang Kai looked down and could not help but show a look of astonishment. “A child?”

He had never expected that the one Huang Juan spoke of would turn out to be a child!

From her appearance she was only about six or seven years old, under three chi tall, slim and slight, her face sallow—clearly a little malnourished. Her clothes were coarse linen but clean, free of dirt and dust; her hair had a faint yellow tint and still bore childishness, yet her eyes were round, bright, and extraordinarily spirited.

She was not Huang Juan's offspring—there was no resemblance between them—and as Yang Kai knew, Huang Juan had never given birth.

Then where had this little girl come from?

The little lass seemed shy and a little curious, hiding behind Huang Juan, staring at Yang Kai with wide dark eyes, but she said nothing.

Huang Juan coaxed her a few times to pay respects, but she remained unmoved, only shaking her head while watching Yang Kai with some wariness. That look made Yang Kai frown, and an inexplicable sting rose in his chest.

A child of that age should understand nothing, yet she regarded him with caution, which meant she had likely experienced something that terrified her and therefore dared not approach strangers.

“Sect Master, please forgive her—Yun'er is still young and doesn't know proper manners. I beg you not to take offense.” Huang Juan stood and looked at Yang Kai with a wry smile.

“No matter.” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, his Divine Sense sweeping over the little girl. He said in surprise, “She's already at the peak of the Open Origin Realm—did you teach her?”

“Mm.” Huang Juan slightly nodded. “Yun'er pestered me to teach her, so I taught her a little.”

“Not bad, not bad.” Yang Kai showed approval. To reach the peak of the Open Origin Realm at such a young age would be impossible in Zhongdu, and with Huang Juan's means she likely couldn't provide the best training conditions or resources—in other words, the girl's aptitude was quite good.

After hesitating, Yang Kai used Divine Sense to ask, “What about her parents?”

“They died three years ago.” Huang Juan answered gloomily.

Huang Juan then briefly told the story of the little girl.

The little girl's surname was Lin. Her full name was Lin Yun'er. Her father had no sect, while her mother had once been a female disciple of the Sea Hall. The Sea Hall is a major force on the Wuyou Sea; its reputation on the sea is comparable to the Leitai Sect of the Battle Sky Alliance inland.

Lin Yun'er's mother apparently held some status within the Sea Hall. A woman like her would have had many choices for a husband, but love is inexplicable—after meeting Lin Yun'er's father she fell helplessly in love, and the two privately pledged themselves to each other.

When the Sea Hall's higher-ups learned of it, enraged, they expelled Lin Yun'er's mother from the Sea Hall.

Although they did so, the Sea Hall did not make things excessively hard for her and tacitly permitted her to live in Haicheng City. From then on Lin Yun'er's parents became a struggling couple, but in love they got by and their days were reasonably comfortable.

But warriors do not merely live—they must cultivate.

Both were only at the Saint King Realm, similar to Huang Juan. Without a sect's support they had to fend for themselves, going to sea to hunt sea beasts for Inner Cores and pelts and bones to exchange for cultivation resources.

It was for this reason that Huang Juan came to know them and formed a small hunting team with the couple.

But on an outing three years ago the three encountered an Eighth-Tier sea beast; Lin Yun'er's parents perished on the spot, and only Huang Juan barely escaped back to Haicheng City. From then on she raised Lin Yun'er at her side.

At that time little Lin Yun'er was only three or four years old, just starting to remember things.

One could say most of Lin Yun'er's memories and all she learned came from Huang Juan—their relationship was like mother and daughter.

Her wariness of strangers stemmed from the fact that when her parents were alive they had borrowed Saint Crystals from others; after news of their deaths those creditors came looking to take Lin Yun'er as repayment, but Huang Juan intervened and paid off the debts for her.

In short, Lin Yun'er's background was tragic—she lost both parents at a young age, and if not for Huang Juan's care over these three years it was doubtful she would have survived.

This shabby house had been where Lin Yun'er's parents once lived; after their deaths Huang Juan stayed on to conveniently take care of Lin Yun'er.

“So that's how it is!” Yang Kai nodded lightly after hearing Huang Juan's tale, a feeling of pity welling in his heart.

At that moment the previously silent Lin Yun'er suddenly spoke, “Are you here to take Yun'er away?”

Her voice was clear and extremely pleasant; as she asked, a pair of limpid eyes fixed on Yang Kai like a pure spring, without a trace of impurity.

Yang Kai laughed and grinned, “Indeed—I am here to take you away.”

Lin Yun'er showed no fear; she tilted her head and thought for a moment, “Can you come back in a few years?”

“Why?” Yang Kai was curious how such a child could think.

“I'll grow up quickly. In a few years I'll be able to go hunt sea beasts, and then I'll bring you many Saint Crystals—so many you'll never spend them all in your life!”

She clearly thought Yang Kai had come to collect a debt.

Yang Kai was taken aback and couldn't help laughing heartily.

Huang Juan looked embarrassed as she listened.

“Very good—small in body but big in spirit, a strong will.” Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction.

“So don't take Yun'er away—Yun'er doesn't want to be separated from Aunt Huang!” Lin Yun'er said crisply.

At those words Huang Juan's eyes filled with tears. Though Lin Yun'er was not her biological child, after these years together she had come to regard her as her own; hearing that she could not help but hug the little girl.

“Mm, this time I’m not only here to take Yun’er with me, but also your Aunt Huang. Now, what should I do about that?” Yang Kai said, feigning a troubled look.

“Oh... so you're a bad man!” Lin Yun'er exclaimed in sudden realization, pointing at Yang Kai with her small hand and scolding him firmly.

In a child's eyes everything is black and white; anything that seems to threaten them is simply a bad person.

Yang Kai smiled without replying.

“Sect Master...” Huang Juan hesitated as she looked at him.

“Mm, no need to say more—bring her along.” Yang Kai smiled faintly; since matters were not what he'd feared and it was only a child, what did it matter?

“Thank you, Sect Master!” Huang Juan rejoiced. Though she had thought Yang Kai would likely agree, if he had refused she would have had to remain and continue caring for Lin Yun'er.

“Yun'er, go thank the Sect Master for his great kindness.” Huang Juan pulled Lin Yun'er from her arms and pointed to Yang Kai.

“No—he's a bad man; he wants to take Yun'er away.” Lin Yun'er stubbornly stuck to her judgment, stepping forward two paces and swinging a small fist at Yang Kai.

Her stance looked decent, but her footing was unsteady.

Yang Kai smiled and held out a hand to block.

Seeing this, Huang Juan gave a helpless wry smile; she knew Yang Kai wouldn't be angered by a child's words nor would he harm her, so she did not intervene.

With a thud the small fist struck Yang Kai's palm squarely.

Yang Kai's eyebrows involuntarily rose, astonishment on his face as if he'd discovered something incredible. He gently pushed Lin Yun'er back and taunted, “Not enough strength—try again.”

“Hmph!” Lin Yun'er, fearless like a young calf, puckered her lips and threw another punch.

After a short while she panted and looked at Yang Kai in frustration; after all, what could a mere Open Origin Realm peak little girl do to affect him? After throwing several punches she had to accept the helpless reality.

Yang Kai's eyes, however, shone brightly as if he'd discovered a treasure, his face full of excitement.

“What's the matter, Sect Master?” Huang Juan asked, suspiciously watching Yang Kai.

“Haven't you ever sparred with her before?” Yang Kai asked back without answering.

“No.” Huang Juan slowly shook her head. “I only taught Yun'er cultivation; I haven't sparred with her.”

“No wonder.” Yang Kai pondered.

“Sect Master, is there... something wrong with Yun'er?” Huang Juan suddenly grew anxious.

“Nothing's wrong, don't worry.” Yang Kai shook his head slowly, a faint smile at his lips as he looked at Lin Yun'er. “It's just that this girl's strength is great.”

“Very strong?” Huang Juan was stunned.

“Forget it—let's talk about this back at the Sect. It can't be explained right now, and I don't know the exact reason.” Yang Kai did not elaborate; he merely recalled how the force from her punches during their play had been somewhat unusual.

Although Lin Yun'er had reached the peak of the Open Origin Realm, she was too young to know how to use Yuan Qi in combat, so the punches she threw were entirely physical strength.

That strength could almost rival an ordinary untrained strongman!

It was bewildering—how could a mere six- or seven-year-old with such a frail body possess such powerful force? A prodigious gift, or something else? Though experienced, Yang Kai could not judge at a glance, so he buried the question in his heart, planning to discuss it after returning.

“Yes.” Huang Juan naturally did not pry and simply nodded.

Although Lin Yun'er had instinctively labeled Yang Kai a bad man, after Huang Juan's explanation she no longer resisted.

There was nothing to pack—the house could be described as bare walls—so soon Huang Juan took Lin Yun'er's small hand and followed Yang Kai toward the center of Haicheng City.
