## Chapter 317 — Letian Pharmacy

“Do… do you want them all?” The shopkeeper’s expression was one of shock, and even Bilo looked at Yang Kai in confusion: “What do you need all this for? You haven't reached the Divine Roaming Realm yet.”

“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t!” Yang Kai replied flatly.

“Miss Bilo, this…” The shopkeeper turned to seek her guidance.

“Didn’t you hear? This esteemed guest said he wants everything, so take them all out! Pack them up and send them to the lord’s residence. It won't cost you anything extra,” Bilo, annoyed with Yang Kai, transferred all her frustration onto the shopkeeper.

“Y-yes, yes!” The shopkeeper hurriedly responded.

Although Bilo had a poor temper, she never took advantage of people when doing business; she paid fairly for everything, so the shopkeeper was not worried about her dodging payments.

But who was this youth? Bilo seemed to bear a significant grudge against him.

The shopkeeper’s heart raced, and he didn't dare delay. He quickly packed all the pills Yang Kai needed and called a worker to deliver them to the residence.

When the worker passed in front of Bilo, he lowered his head, staring intently at his toes, not daring to glance at her even once.

After leaving the pharmacy, Yang Kai casually glanced at Bilo: “Quite a few men around here seem to fear you!”

“Humph!” Bilo stood tall and proud, with an air of arrogance and satisfaction on her enchanting face, casually declaring, “If they dare look at me, I’ll gouge their eyes out!”

“That’s a bit too excessive,” Yang Kai frowned, “Isn’t being beautiful meant for others to see? If no one looks at you, what’s the point of being pretty, no matter how beautiful you are?”

“What do you know?” Bilo shot him a disdainful glare, “You men think only of filthy and dirty things. Seeing a beauty, you just want to do bad things. I don’t want to be viewed with such lewd eyes!”

“Not everyone is like that, right?” Yang Kai argued back unyieldingly.

Bilo sized him up with a glance, suddenly saying, “Well, you’re not like that at least. You haven’t shown any lewdness in your gaze while looking at me. I’ll grant you that. In that regard, you are better than many men.”

“You flatter me, Miss Bilo!” Yang Kai responded lightly.

“And what now… where do you want to go?” Bilo, with her hands behind her back, her petite and charming figure evident, said with slight impatience, “If you don’t want to wander around, I’ll head back to the residence to cultivate.”

“Of course I want to wander. Piaoxiang City has to have more than just this pharmacy, right?”

“There are four or five others. Do you still want to go to the pharmacies?” Bilo looked at him in slight surprise, “You’re not planning to buy pills for nourishing your Divine Sense, are you?”

“Of course I want to buy some.”

“What do you need so many for? Can you even use them?” Bilo complained. Then she pouted, saying, “Fine, fine, I won’t meddle. If you want to buy, I’ll take you.”

With a glint in her eye, she suddenly giggled, quickly reining in her expression and pretending to be nonchalant as she walked in front.

While Piaoxiang City wasn't small, there were only a handful of pharmacies. After all, to sell pills ostentatiously required a strong family backing; the financial, manpower, and material resources involved were things some small forces simply couldn’t manage.

Thus, there were only five pharmacies in total in the city.

Bilo led the way without complaint, and after half a day's effort, they finally finished visiting the first four, completely depleting all the pills for nourishing Divine Sense from those pharmacies. She then guided Yang Kai toward the fifth pharmacy.

Inside Letian Pharmacy, a young man in tight clothing rushed upstairs in a hurry. He gently knocked on the door of a private room.

Immediately, a thunderous voice shouted from within: “Damn it, who is it! Didn’t I say not to disturb me with any trivial matters? I swear I’ll twist your head off, you bastard!”

“Young Master, it’s about Miss Bilo,” the young man, scolded without a word, respectfully replied.

Inside, a series of loud noises echoed, as if the person within was rushing to stand up and hurriedly ran over with heavy footsteps.

On the first floor of the pharmacy, the other workers all looked pale, their hearts racing as they stared up at the ceiling, fearing their young master would break through it.

With a crash, the door swung open, and out charged a burly man, broad-shouldered and enormously built, resembling a mighty bear.

Though this man was not very old, only in his early twenties, he had an exceptional physique, with a thick beard giving him an exceedingly rugged appearance. Only his small, narrow eyes seemed mismatched with his huge frame, exuding an utterly sinister vibe.

This was Le Yu, the young master of the family behind Letian Pharmacy.

The Le family was a powerful force in Piaoxiang City, with the family head being an elder of the city, aiding the Shan family for over two hundred years — a notable contribution.

The Le family’s main residence was not in Piaoxiang City but rather in a villa located a hundred miles outside the city.

Le Yu stayed in the pharmacy in Piaoxiang City because of Bilo. After meeting her unexpectedly a year ago, he became infatuated, determined to marry her.

Though Bilo came from humble beginnings and was neither a modest beauty nor a refined lady, she was the most favored at Shan Qingluo’s side, so the Le family supported this pursuit and allowed Le Yu to stay in the city.

Unfortunately, in the past year, Le Yu had only seen Bilo a few times, and each time she had fled in panic.

Even Le Yu did not dare recklessly intrude on Shan Qingluo's residence, and each time Bilo escaped to the palace, he could only sigh with regret from afar.

If anyone in Piaoxiang City had Bilo worried, apart from Le Yu, there was no one else.

The thought of this man, whose build was four times larger than her, often haunted Bilo's dreams, waking her in fright.

Rushing out of the room, Le Yu grabbed the young man who had come to report, lifting him as if he were a chick, with his feet dangling in the air.

“What’s wrong with Bilo?” Le Yu asked urgently.

The young man's forehead was drenched in cold sweat as he hastily replied, “Young Master, didn’t you say before that once Miss Bilo leaves the palace, you would be informed? She’s out today!”

“She’s out?” Le Yu’s expression brightened, as he tossed the young man to the ground and rushed out three steps before turning back to ask, “Where is she now?”

The young man’s expression was strange as he said: “Miss Bilo is heading toward Letian Pharmacy!”

“Hmm?” Le Yu’s expression froze, a cold glint flashing in his narrowed eyes, “You didn’t make a mistake, did you?”

“Absolutely not; she is indeed coming to Letian Pharmacy.”

“How could that be?” Though Le Yu was extraordinarily handsome, he was also sharp-minded and had long known that Bilo did not think highly of him. Each time she had been chased back to the lord’s palace by him, how could such a beauty voluntarily come to him?

“Is she alone?” Suddenly recalling something, Le Yu’s expression darkened as his small, narrow eyes slightly narrowed, emanating a chilling light.

“Not…,” the young man stuttered, trembling, “It seems… she’s coming with a young man.”

“Humph!” Le Yu’s true essence erupted suddenly, and the room upstairs burst apart with a crack. Grinning sinisterly, he declared, “A young man… I must see who dares covet a woman of mine!”

On the street, Yang Kai regarded Bilo suspiciously. Although he knew she must be plotting something, he was unsure of what her actual intentions were.

This enchanting girl wore an expression of uncertainty, seeming to be struggling with her thoughts.

Bilo was indeed somewhat worried; Le Yu was not an easy person to deal with, and if they truly arrived at Letian Pharmacy, things were bound to stir up some waves.

What if this annoying brat was killed by Le Yu?

He was a distinguished guest of the lord; if anything happened, it wouldn’t be easy to explain to her lord.

But soon, Bilo felt relieved again; if worst came to worst, she could invoke the lord’s name. Even if Le Yu was arrogant, he wouldn’t dare lose face with the lord.

Yes, just teach this brat a lesson to prevent him from thinking this young lady is easy to bully.

Recalling Yang Kai's previous attitude toward her, Bilo felt a surge of hatred.

“Are we there yet?” Yang Kai frowned and asked. Bilo was walking particularly slowly on this stretch of the road, seemingly deep in thought.

“We’re here!” Bilo elegantly pointed her delicate fingers ahead, “That is the largest pharmacy in Piaoxiang City, and it's the last one.”

“Perhaps… we should skip it.” After a moment of hesitation, Bilo suddenly said, now reluctant to be so vicious.

“Why?” Yang Kai looked at her with intrigue, his expression playful.

“There’s someone there that I really dislike!”

“That might not be an option,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, “Someone’s here to invite us.”

“Ah?” Bilo’s face fell in disbelief, and she looked up, her expression turning sour.

From across the street, several muscular young men in tight clothing rushed out of Letian Pharmacy, making their way directly toward them.

Each of them was formidable, young but full of capabilities, all being True Essence Realm experts. They arrived before the two, smiling and cupping their fists: “Miss Bilo, my young master has been waiting for a long time. We kindly ask for your grace to come inside the pharmacy for a discussion.”

“I have nothing to say to your young master!” Bilo’s face was filled with disgust as she tugged on Yang Kai’s arm, “Let’s go!”

The few men shifted to block their path, forcing a wry smile as they said, “Miss Bilo, if you refuse to go, we fear we’ll have to face dire consequences today. We ask for your compassion and that you not let our young master get angry.”

“Your fates have nothing to do with me!” Bilo coldly scolded.

One of them helplessly replied, “The young master also said that if Miss Bilo doesn’t want to comply, it’s fine, but this Young Master must go with us!”

“He dares!” Bilo’s voice turned even colder, anger and regret flickering in her beautiful eyes.

She shouldn’t have dragged Yang Kai into this murky water; knowing well that coming here meant trouble, she still brought him along, making her feel quite regretful.

“Ha ha, whether he dares or not isn’t up to Miss Bilo to decide. This Young Master, please!” The men grinned at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression was indifferent as he frowned and said, “I’m here to buy pills; whatever grievances you have, I won’t get involved, and don’t drag me into this.”
