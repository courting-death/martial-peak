## Chapter 237 â€” The Secret of the Slave Beast

In just thirty breaths of time, Yang Kai severed Jin Hao's pair of ghostly claws with a single sword strike. Having lost his most crucial hands, Jin Hao had no possibility of resistance left. He fled in panic, unable even to fly in the air, and was ultimately slain under the combined efforts of Yang Kai and the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast.

With Jin Hao's death, the other two Demonic Beasts that had been watching from the sidelines seemed to receive some sort of command and fled in unison.

Yang Kai had been vigilant of their movements from the beginning, knowing they were the subordinates of the martial artists from Tianlang Kingdom. Although he wished to kill them, their speed was too great, and it would be difficult to pursue them for the time being. To prevent any unforeseen changes, he could only allow them to escape.

Taking a gentle breath, he glanced at the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast standing beside him. Yang Kai's furrowed brow gradually relaxed, and a hint of joy appeared between his brows.

This battle was even easier than his previous fight with the disciple of Jiu Xing Sword Sect.

The presence of the Earth Demon and the sudden betrayal of this Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast were the keys to Jin Hao's demise.

Jin Hao would probably never understand why the Demonic Beast he had brought with him would turn against him.

The root of it all lay in the Beast Soul Technique.

This was a method Yang Kai had inadvertently discovered. A few days ago, when he encountered a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, he had initially intended to use the Beast Soul Technique to summon two beast souls for assistance. However, for reasons unknown, the two beast souls unexpectedly fused into one, transforming into a wisp of ethereal light that darted into the body of that Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast.

To his astonishment, that Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast actually obeyed Yang Kai's commands!

This accidental discovery had left Yang Kai ecstatic. Recently, he had been exploring the mysteries within this technique, but he had always felt somewhat at a loss. Even the execution of this move had been inconsistent, often leading to some blunders.

Moreover, the number of Demonic Beasts he encountered had been dwindling, leaving him with few subjects for experimentation, which was quite regrettable.

However, he had already come up with a name for this technique.

The fusion of the White Tiger Seal and the Divine Ox Seal formed a martial skill he called the Slave Beast Seal!

When separated, it could summon two beast souls for assistance; when combined, it formed a new martial skill.

In his battle with Jin Hao, the Slave Beast Seal had played a significant role. If it hadn't been for that Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast's sudden ambush at the last moment, with Jin Hao's abilities and strength, he might have very well escaped.

If used correctly, this technique was undoubtedly much more powerful than the White Tiger Seal and the Divine Ox Seal. Although the two beast souls had formidable attacks, their overall strength was still somewhat lacking. Combined, they were only equivalent to the combat power of the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast before him, merely having the advantage of an extra number.

Thirty li away, the closed-eyed Zi Mo suddenly opened her eyes, her beautiful gaze filled with even more astonishment than before.

Standing not far behind her, Leng Shan also wore a look of surprise, staring blankly in the direction of Yang Kai, her expression a mix of sorrow and a bittersweet sense of satisfaction.

After all, Jin Hao was her senior brother. Although he had previously agreed to Zi Mo's request, making Leng Shan detest him, death extinguished all grievances. There was no need to hold onto past grudges. Instead, she found herself alone, under the control of this unpredictable woman from Tianlang Kingdom, with an uncertain future ahead.

As Jin Hao perished, both women sensed it through different means.

"Your senior brother... is dead," Zi Mo said slowly, casting a faint glance at Leng Shan.

"Good riddance!" Leng Shan sneered.

"Hehe... indeed. A useless man, he disappointed me greatly," Zi Mo giggled, her delicate brows furrowing. After a moment of contemplation, she added, "But he did possess some skills to be able to kill him in such a short time. Truly a master!"

As she spoke, Zi Mo's eyes lit up, as if she had discovered some new and fascinating toy, her pretty face brimming with excitement. Even her breathing became slightly hurried.

With a light step, Zi Mo moved towards Yang Kai's direction. The dozens of Demonic Beasts that had been lying on the ground hurriedly stood up and followed her lead.

Leng Shan glanced over but said nothing, following suit.

She knew there was no possibility of escape. Not to mention that she couldn't handle the dozens of Demonic Beasts, even the things Zi Mo had planted within her body were enough to control her life and death.

Yang Kai stored away the blood bead formed from Jin Hao's death and turned to look at the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast beside him.

				This was a Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard, exuding an imposing aura. Its form was agile and streamlined, with every muscle containing terrifying explosive power. Its sharp claws could easily pierce through three inches of fine steel.

Yang Kai could sense that this Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast was much stronger than the several he had killed a few days ago; it was likely at the mid-stage of the Fifth-Tier.

Equivalent to the True Yuan Realm's sixth or seventh layer.

That said, in a real battle, it would certainly not be a match for a martial artist at the sixth or seventh layer of the True Yuan Realm. Even a martial artist at the second or third layer of the True Yuan Realm could easily kill it.

What puzzled Yang Kai was not its strength, but its current state.

There was an unsettling feeling that he could not fully control it.

This felt very wrong; a beast under the Slave Beast Seal should not behave this way. Moreover, the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard was currently in a state of agitation, constantly shaking its head and tail, low growls escaping its throat.

There was a problem!

Yang Kai recalled the slave techniques of the martial artists from Tianlang Kingdom and speculated that there might be some conflict with his Slave Beast Seal.

He stepped forward, soothing the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard while extending a hand to rest on its forehead, secretly circulating his Yuan Qi into it, exploring within its body.

After circulating his Yuan Qi a few times, Yang Kai finally found a troubling area.

Inside the head of the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard, there was actually another entity radiating life fluctuations.

Yang Kai's expression turned to one of astonishment as he stared deeply at the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard, feeling that it was becoming increasingly uncomfortable. The Slave Beast Seal that had entered its body was competing with this unknown entity for control.

When two tigers fight, one will surely be injured. Regardless of which side ultimately wins, the one who suffers in the end will be the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard.

Furrowing his brow, Yang Kai increased the output of his Yuan Qi, carefully controlling the entire process, not daring to be too violent. The beast core of the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard was located here; if it were damaged, the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard would undoubtedly perish.

He waited until the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard adapted before daring to increase the infusion of Yuan Qi.

After doing this three or four times, the entity in its head finally seemed unable to withstand it and was rapidly trying to escape. Noticing this, Yang Kai focused his mind, wanting to understand what method the martial artists from Tianlang Kingdom had used to enslave the Demonic Beasts.

After a dozen breaths, a worm about three inches long suddenly emerged from the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard's forehead.

Yang Kai's reflexes were quick, and he swiftly grabbed it in his hand.

With a hurried glance, he saw that this worm resembled a centipede and somewhat resembled a leech. Before he could examine it closely, the worm unexpectedly burrowed into his body along his finger.

Yang Kai was taken aback and quickly urged his Yuan Qi.

In the next moment, the worm was enveloped by the scorching True Yang Yuan Qi, directly immobilized within his meridians.

Frowning, Yang Kai did not kill it outright. He could sense that this worm was very afraid of his True Yang Yuan Qi. If it weren't for that, it wouldn't have been forced out of the Nightshade Golden Shadow Leopard's body.

Since True Yang Yuan Qi was its nemesis, there was naturally no need for concern.

Speaking of which, back on Hidden Island, Yang Kai had once had a Heaven-Devouring Insect burrow into his body, but the Heaven-Devouring Insect was clearly much stronger than this one.

Feeling carefully, the worm trembled within his meridians, not daring to move at all, behaving more obediently than a mouse before a cat.

There was a peculiar energy flowing within the worm's body, very subtle, and without careful probing, one would not be able to detect it.

"Earth Demon, take a look at this worm. Is there anything unusual about it?" Yang Kai called out with a furrowed brow.

The Earth Demon responded, wrapping the Soul-Breaking Spike around the place where the worm was imprisoned, probing for a while before saying, "Young Master, this worm has a thread of the soul of a martial artist from Tianlang Kingdom attached to it."

"A thread of the soul?" Yang Kai frowned. "Aren't they only at the True Yuan Realm? How could they manage to do this without cultivating Divine Sense?"

The Earth Demon chuckled lightly, "Young Master, have you forgotten? You also have a thread of soul attached to me, yet you, like them, have not cultivated Divine Sense."

Yang Kai suddenly realized, "Are you saying... someone is helping them?"

"Precisely. It is likely a master from their sect who helped them imprint the thread of soul into this worm, allowing them to control it at will."

"They control the worm... the worm burrows into the Demonic Beast's body... so they can enslave the Demonic Beasts!" Yang Kai's eyes brightened, and the confusion in his heart was instantly resolved.

A few days ago, Chen Xueshu had told Yang Kai that those from Tianlang Kingdom had hundreds of Demonic Beasts under their command, and he had always wondered how they managed to enslave such a large number of Demonic Beasts.

Only now did he understand that they were not controlling the Demonic Beasts directly, but this peculiar worm, which allowed them to command the actions of the Demonic Beasts.

Lost in thought, Yang Kai hurried to the spot where Jin Hao had died, clearing away the powdery remains. Just as he had guessed, he found another identical worm inside!

Reaching out to grab it, he allowed the worm to burrow into his body. After being examined by the Earth Demon, it was confirmed that this worm also had a thread of soul imprinted within it.

"So Jin Hao was not colluding with the martial artists from Tianlang Kingdom..." Yang Kai muttered to himself.

He must have been forced into cooperation after this worm burrowed into his body, unable to resist the control of the martial artists from Tianlang Kingdom.

This explained why the three Demonic Beasts that had come with him did not obey his commands. In a sense, Jin Hao and those three Demonic Beasts were on equal footing. While this was somewhat tragic, it was the truth.

Zi Mo...

Jin Hao had just called out this name. Was the martial artist from Tianlang Kingdom controlling him named Zi Mo?

Yang Kai's thoughts raced, and a wild idea surged forth. A strange smile crept onto his lips as he asked, "Earth Demon, if I were to refine this worm with True Yang Yuan Qi, would the martial artist from Tianlang Kingdom's soul also be injured?"

"Naturally. Although there are only two threads of soul, a sudden attack could still cause her significant harm."

"Hehe!" Yang Kai couldn't help but chuckle darkly, his mind rapidly spinning through several schemes he could employ.

The Earth Demon suddenly added, "Young Master, I have a suggestion, kekekeke..."

"Oh? Let's hear it," Yang Kai said, knowing from the Earth Demon's chuckle that it was likely not a good idea.
