## Chapter 231 — Pursuit (Part Two)

In the jungle, Yang Kai's figure moved like a spirit monkey, leaping from treetop to treetop with ease. He was as light as a swallow, and as he sprinted, he only stirred up a slight breeze, not even causing a single leaf to fall.

His expression was grave as Yang Kai remained vigilant of his surroundings while contemplating his next course of action. Although his encounter with Wu Chengyi and his group had not been particularly pleasant, it had not affected him in the slightest; his objective had already been achieved.

However, he had not anticipated that the information he had gathered would turn out to be so severe.

Over the years, disciples from various sects entering this foreign land for training had always acted independently. Even if there were occasional alliances, they could never merge on such a large scale. Yet this time, due to the appearance of several martial artists from the Tianlang Kingdom, the martial artists of the Great Han had completely banded together as one.

This was unprecedented, and it had escalated to the level of a life-and-death struggle between the younger generations of the two nations.

Ultimately, who would win and who would lose was not something Yang Kai could influence. However, as a martial artist of the Great Han, he honestly did not wish to see the people of the Tianlang Kingdom act arrogantly here.

If it weren't for the two individuals from the Shura Sect, and if Wu Chengyi hadn't been so overbearing, Yang Kai might have stayed behind to assist Chen Xueshu and the others in this conflict.

Thinking about it now was futile. Yang Kai expelled the distracting thoughts from his mind and suddenly halted his sprint, glancing back with an odd expression.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai let out a sinister smile, descended to the ground, and swiftly hid behind a large tree, concealing his aura.

Moments later, a figure flew past not far above his head. In an instant, Yang Kai had clearly seen the person's face and attire.

This person was carrying a long sword on his back and wore a blue long robe. He appeared to be in his early twenties, with a stern expression, and flew straight in the direction Yang Kai had just come from.

Yang Kai snorted coldly to himself, a killing intent flashing in his eyes!

This person was the martial artist who had previously cleaned the battlefield and collected blood beads. The long sword on his back clearly indicated his identity—he was a disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect and should also be a junior brother of Wu Chengyi.

He was not acting with the others but had chased after Yang Kai, and his intentions were quite obvious.

Yang Kai's expression turned cold. Previously, he had refrained from clashing with Wu Chengyi out of consideration for Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu. Now that someone was sent to pursue him relentlessly, there was no reason for him to retreat any longer.

Even a clay figurine has some temper, let alone Yang Kai, who was no pushover.

Suddenly, the sound of fluttering clothes came from ahead. The disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect had returned, rushing back while scanning the surroundings with his eyes. He couldn't help but mutter, "Strange, where did he go?"

He was a True Yuan Realm expert and believed that his speed was certainly much greater than Yang Kai's. However, despite following Yang Kai's trail, he had somehow lost him. Forced to return to investigate, he became even more focused.

Yang Kai felt puzzled and thought to himself that this person indeed had some skills in tracking. He had been cautious throughout his journey and left no traces, yet this person still managed to find a flaw.

After a moment, the disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect stopped about thirty zhang away from Yang Kai, frowning as he scanned the area.

Yang Kai was not in a hurry. Hidden behind the large tree, he quietly observed the man.

After a long while, a faint smile appeared on the man's lips as he reached behind him. With a crisp sound of a sword unsheathing, the long sword was drawn.

With the sword in hand, the man's aura suddenly surged, and he became as sharp as a sword.

A high disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect indeed had some skills! Just this aura alone was not something an ordinary True Yuan Realm expert could possess.

"I know you're nearby!" Qi Jianxing said, a meaningful smile on his lips. Holding his long sword, he spoke with certainty, "Come out obediently, and I won't make things difficult for you!"

Yang Kai's brows furrowed. He was unsure whether this disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect had truly discovered something or was merely bluffing.

Qi Jianxing continued, "Kid, I admire your courage. In this world, aside from the young masters of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, you're probably the only one who dares to speak to my senior brother like that. For this reason, I guarantee I won't harm you, as long as you hand over all the pills on you so that I can complete my senior brother's task."

Silence reigned around them. Qi Jianxing showed impatience and threatened, "Don't be ungrateful; if I find your hiding place, it won't be so easy to talk. While I'm still in a good mood, we can discuss this."

Still, there was no response. Qi Jianxing stopped hesitating. With a shake of his sword, the crisp and pleasant sound of the sword echoed.

Yang Kai suddenly felt a faint chill in the air, causing his expression to change. He shot upward in a hurry.

Invisible sword qi threads crisscrossed in the air, and the trees within a radius of thirty zhang were instantly severed, falling neatly to the ground with smooth cuts.

Yang Kai's face was filled with shock. It was only at this moment that he truly understood the sinister nature of this disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect. When he spoke to him earlier, it seemed like a ruse to buy time, but in reality, he was harboring malicious intent and had secretly set up his attack.

Those invisible sword qi threads had already spread around while he was speaking. Once he activated them, as long as Yang Kai remained hidden here, he would have nowhere to escape.

Fortunately, he had sensed something was amiss and shot upward; otherwise, he would have been struck by the sword qi, and without any defenses, he might have been injured.

Feeling a lingering fear, Yang Kai did not dare to underestimate this person. The Jiu Xing Sword Sect was known as the foremost power beneath the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, and its elite disciples were certainly not to be taken lightly.

"I found you!" Qi Jianxing suddenly turned around, a sinister smile on his face as he looked at Yang Kai falling from the sky, his gaze mocking.

Yet he did not attack again but instead watched Yang Kai leisurely. Facing a martial artist at the Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union, Qi Jianxing naturally felt no fear. This level of opponent, coming from a second-rate sect, could be easily slain with a single sword strike.

"Your hiding and aura-concealing techniques are quite exquisite," Qi Jianxing praised without reservation. "Who taught you?"

He was very interested in Yang Kai's concealment skills. In such a perilous place filled with dangers, having such skills would provide a glimmer of hope. This was also the main reason he had not rushed to attack Yang Kai immediately.

Yang Kai grinned, "No matter how exquisite, you still saw through it."

Qi Jianxing slowly shook his head, a hint of admiration and greed in his eyes. "I didn't see through it. It's just that you harbor hostility toward me, causing my sword qi to react. In truth, I only knew you were hiding nearby but didn't know where exactly. Forcing you out this time was just luck."

He explained to himself, then suddenly smiled coldly, "You're a smart person. Since I'm standing here, you should know my intentions. Hand over all the pills on you, and then tell me the method of your concealment. I will spare your life!"

Yang Kai sneered, "Do you think you have me at your mercy?"

Qi Jianxing was taken aback, then laughed heartily, "And what do you think?"

A mere seventh-level Separation and Union martial artist, who hadn't even advanced to the True Yuan Realm, could threaten him?

After a moment, he reined in his laughter, nodded slightly, and arrogantly declared, "Very well, if I beat you to a pulp, I can naturally force you to reveal your cultivation method!"

As he spoke, he flicked his long sword.

With a crisp sound, several sword lights suddenly appeared before him, arranged in a fan shape, each radiating a chilling glow, each containing immense lethality.

"Go!" Qi Jianxing called out, his sword technique extraordinary. As he made his move, his prowess was evident. With a wave of his long sword, several sword lights shot toward Yang Kai like lightning.

Sensing the threat from these sword lights, Yang Kai quickly retreated, his expression changing.

As expected of a top disciple from a major sect! Despite his young age, he possessed such strength.

In less than a breath's time, the sword lights reached Yang Kai, piercing through his body. Qi Jianxing's brows furrowed, seemingly surprised by how smoothly things were going. He did not want to kill Yang Kai just yet; he still needed to extract the method of that concealment technique. Thus, he had held back in his previous attack, not using any overly powerful moves.

In the next moment, Qi Jianxing's eyes brightened, and with another flick of his sword, he slashed to the side.

Another sword light, like a rainbow, shot through the air.

As soon as Yang Kai revealed himself, the second attack from his opponent arrived, forcing him to use his self-created footwork to barely evade the strike.

"Good, good, good!" Qi Jianxing exclaimed, his expression invigorated. After two moves, he had not attacked again but instead watched Yang Kai with excitement. "Your footwork is quite impressive! A Seventh Stage Separation and Union martial artist can achieve such speed in an instant. If I were to learn it, it would surely enhance my abilities! You must teach it to me later."

Yang Kai took a deep breath, steadying himself, and smiled as he replied, "Since you want my concealment technique and footwork so much, why don't we make a deal?"

"What kind of deal?" Qi Jianxing raised an eyebrow.

"I'll give you what you want, and you teach me a few sword techniques from the Jiu Xing Sword Sect! How about that?"

"You want to learn sword techniques?" Qi Jianxing looked at Yang Kai with a strange expression, sizing him up but finding no trace of a long sword on him.

Without a weapon, what could he learn about sword techniques?

"Yes, we both get what we need, and no one loses out," Yang Kai nodded. Although he currently had no sword in hand, he possessed a Shura Sword within his body. In terms of the intricacies and lethality of sword techniques, the Jiu Xing Sword Sect was undoubtedly the best, a fact that even the transcendent powers like the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu could not deny.

"Ridiculous! How could the sword techniques of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect be shared with outsiders?" Qi Jianxing sneered. "Moreover, the difference in our strengths is vast. I could easily take your life; why would I need to make any deal with you?"

Yang Kai chuckled, his innate pride and wickedness ignited, gritting his teeth, "I still say the same thing: do you really think you can take me down?"

"Just because your footwork is impressive, once I capture you, I'll discuss it with you in detail!" Qi Jianxing snorted coldly and no longer used sword lights. He knew that sword lights were ineffective against Yang Kai. As he spoke, he swept his sword light and lunged toward Yang Kai.
