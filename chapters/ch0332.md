## Chapter 332 — Sudden Change

Two factions gathered in one place, quickly discussing matters before deciding to advance.

Shen Yi reluctantly led the way at the front, flanked by two Disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect, a male and a female. The rest of the group scattered behind, arranged in a fan shape, ready to engage in battle at any moment.

Not long after, they indeed saw two violet-hued evil spirits drifting toward them. These purple evil spirits exuded a heavy aura of killing intent, fiercer than the red spirits, with bodies more solidified, even their facial features were clearer.

Moreover, they grew two tentacle-like appendages, vaguely hinting at five fingers, exuding an eerie aura.

“They're coming!” Shen Yi shouted sharply, silently channeling True Yuan within him.

“One for each of you!” Yu Qing stated calmly, prompting both the Ghost King Valley and Xiaoyao Sect members to heighten their spirits, splitting to either side and engaging with the respective evil spirits.

The wailing cries of the spirits penetrated deeply, sending chills down the spine.

In a flash, the group clashed with the two Purple Evil Spirits.

Disciples from Ghost King Valley unleashed various chilling martial skills, coordinating seamlessly with each other as they maneuvered against one evil spirit.

The members of the Xiaoyao Sect did the same; however, their martial skills appeared far more appealing compared to those of Ghost King Valley.

Yang Kai merely hovered on the sidelines, not taking significant action. Occasionally, he would strike a few blows, trying to discern just how formidable the Purple Evil Spirits truly were.

After a brief observation, he grasped the general situation.

The Purple Evil Spirits were indeed much harder to deal with than the red ones. Even though the seven or eight members from Ghost King Valley held the advantage, they did not dare to be too aggressive or reckless, instead steadily wearing down the spirits’ power little by little.

If three of these evil spirits rushed at the same time, Yang Kai estimated that the members of Ghost King Valley would not be able to cope.

After a fierce battle, they eventually killed their respective spirits, leaving behind an abundance of pristine spirit essence. Both factions had members joyfully step forward, clutching the Purifying Spirit Flask to collect the essence.

The scene had a cheerful and harmonious atmosphere, a sense of cooperation between the two factions.

However, Yang Kai keenly observed that Leng Shan remained vigilant about the movements of the members of Xiaoyao Sect, not letting her guard down even during combat.

After successfully defeating two Purple Evil Spirits, a Ghost King Valley Disciple was about to collect the essence when suddenly, a woman from Xiaoyao Sect dashed out, giggling mischievously, extending her hand to directly devour the gathered spirit essence into her body.

She then lightly floated back to the Xiaoyao Sect’s ranks, wearing an expression of pride and satisfaction. The male Disciple beside her even kissed her cheek, praising, “You’re quite daring, my dear.”

“Hehe, I just wanted you to grow stronger,” the woman replied sweetly.

“Yu Qing!” Shen Yi couldn’t help but shout angrily. “What do you mean by this?”

Yu Qing chuckled, “It means nothing at all.”

“That essence is ours. What do you call this blatant theft?” Shen Yi’s face became cold, and the disciples from Ghost King Valley wore grim expressions as well.

“Shen Yi, why act so foreign? The Xiaoyao Sect and Ghost King Valley are already one family. We’re cooperating sincerely now, so it’s only right to help each other. Collecting essence means you have it as well,” Yu Qing replied nonchalantly.

“Am I to understand that since you killed the evil spirits, we can also collect the essence?” Shen Yi’s expression darkened as he looked at him coldly.

“As long as you can take it, no problem. Hehe!” Yu Qing laughed lightly, “Do not be angry. It’s just a lump of essence; compared to the Huangquan Pool, Ghost King Valley needs this even more, right? Rest assured, after this, I guarantee the Huangquan Pool will be open to you for a month. I, Yu Qing, keep my word!”

Upon hearing Huangquan Pool, Shen Yi’s brow furrowed momentarily. After a long silence, he let out a grunt, “Let’s hope so!”

Not wanting to delve deeper, the Disciples of Ghost King Valley had no immunity to the Huangquan Pool’s allure. If it weren’t for the Xiaoyao Sect being sufficiently strong, they would have attacked long ago.

As both factions continued to advance, the previously harmonious atmosphere was clearly shattered by the recent events.

Yang Kai walked beside Leng Shan, softly inquiring, “Why did that woman directly absorb the essence into her body? I noticed her cultivation methods do not seem to restrain the evil spirits.”

It was precisely because she absorbed the essence directly that the Disciples of Ghost King Valley had not been able to collect it in time, as using the Purifying Spirit Flask required some duration.

“That is a Meinu…” Leng Shan replied softly, “They can bear various harms for the male Disciples of Xiaoyao Sect. Don’t underestimate them; the men of Xiaoyao Sect train Meinus with special cultivation methods, making them utterly devoted. Even if ordered to die, they wouldn’t bat an eye.”

“Is it really that impressive?” Yang Kai exclaimed, realizing that the Xiaoyao Sect had quite the means, as these women completely entrusted their hearts and minds.

“Indeed. A Meinu absorbing that essence will definitely incur some harm, but she doesn’t care, and neither do the men of Xiaoyao Sect. It’s a mutual agreement—one is willing to beat, and the other to endure. Moreover, each man from Xiaoyao Sect has more than one Meinu; if one dies, they wouldn’t care about that.”

“Despicable!” Yang Kai sneered.

“You’re flattering them; they are worse than beasts!” Leng Shan laughed coldly.

While they conversed, Yang Kai indeed saw the woman who had previously absorbed the essence. She was shamelessly kissing the male disciple of Xiaoyao Sect beside her, gasping for breath, her tender tongue flickering seductively as a ball of energy was transmitted from her mouth into the male disciple’s body.

When their lips parted, the man wore a satisfied expression, and his fair complexion seemed rosier. On the other hand, the woman let out a suppressed moan, with a trace of blood at the corner of her mouth.

However, she showed no concern, simply wiping it away lightly, gazing affectionately at her man, a look of sweet happiness on her face.

Yang Kai shook his head inwardly, fully aware that the Xiaoyao Sect’s enslavement of Meinus was indeed quite remarkable.

Half an hour later, after a hard-fought battle, when the disciples of Ghost King Valley had slain a single evil spirit, another woman from Xiaoyao Sect suddenly rushed out, attempting to seize the essence directly again.

Yang Kai frowned, propelling his body forward like a gust of wind. Arriving before the woman, he absorbed the essence into his palm before she could reach it.

“Hmm?” Yu Qing looked at Yang Kai in surprise but didn’t say much, only sneering with a chilling laugh.

The women of Xiaoyao Sect could disregard damage, directly absorbing essence and hastily refining it, leaving the harm for themselves while handing the benefits to their men.

However, Yang Kai’s actions obviously could not avoid damage; thus, Yu Qing found it amusing, believing Ghost King Valley was merely acting out in defiance, happy to watch from the sidelines.

“I owe you two lumps of essence,” Yang Kai smiled broadly as he leaped back.

“No problem, they’re simply a favor for this group of trash; they’d be better off giving it to you, Brother Yang,” Shen Yi laughed heartily, not minding it. He knew Yang Kai’s cultivation methods restrained evil spirits, so even if he absorbed and refined on the spot, there would be no harm.

Leng Shan nodded slightly, agreeing with Shen Yi. The two had no objections, and naturally, the other members of Ghost King Valley wouldn’t voice their discontent, merely eyeing the people from Xiaoyao Sect with increasing resentment.

Over the next half-day, all the essence left by the evil spirits slain by Ghost King Valley was absorbed solely by Yang Kai. Though he intended to not let the essence from Xiaoyao Sect slip by, he refrained, fearing it would make things difficult for Leng Shan and the others.

Seeing how Yang Kai targeted Xiaoyao Sect, Yu Qing kept looking at him with cold eyes, sneering, “Kid, I wonder how long you can last! Absorbing so much essence without refining it, you will eventually fall into Qi Deviation!”

Yang Kai smiled back, “No need to worry about me!”

“Hmph, we’ll see about that!” A cold glint flickered in Yu Qing’s eyes.

Before long, the surroundings became unexpectedly serene, seeming to grow exceedingly calm. After walking for a long while, they hadn’t encountered a single evil spirit again.

The two groups exchanged glances, uncertain about what had transpired.

Just then, a rich aura of energy suddenly emanated not far away.

This energy, filled with killing intent, felt as though a tremendous evil was about to emerge, causing everyone to change countenance.

A moment later, this killing intent abruptly faded, becoming exceedingly tranquil.

The group exchanged glances, each sensing the eagerness in the others’ eyes.

The more dangerous the place, the greater the rewards, and the members of Ghost King Valley and Xiaoyao Sect sensed the blood scent. However, recalling the dense aura of evil, they hesitated.

“Shall we go take a look?” Yu Qing asked hesitantly.

Shen Yi also struggled with indecision, casting his gaze toward Leng Shan.

Leng Shan furrowed her brows deeply, considering seriously.

Before she could think it through, a female disciple from Xiaoyao Sect suddenly shrieked, “Evil spirits!”

“Where?” Yu Qing shouted upon hearing.

“Behind us!” 

As everyone turned around, a cold wind rushed up their spines, their legs feeling numb.

Half a mile back, several violet forms were charging toward them, shrieking sharply, their numbers at least a dozen.

A dozen Purple Evil Spirits were simply beyond what the members of Ghost King Valley and Xiaoyao Sect could handle.

“How can there be so many?” Shen Yi shouted, his face paling at once.

“Run!” Cheng Ying urged urgently.

With no time left for hesitation, the group hurriedly activated their movements, desperately fleeing forward.

“There are evil spirits on both sides!” Yu Qing cried out in panic while running.

Upon looking, they indeed found that both sides were swarming with evil spirits, with many violet figures appearing alarming, all heading straight for their direction, seemingly drawn by the earlier commotion.
