## Chapter 496 — One Good News, One Bad News

Yang Kai's expression clearly showed that something unfortunate had happened to the Yang Family. Qiu Yimeng thought to herself but did not dare ask immediately; she silently welcomed him into the mansion.

In the side hall, the leading figures of many factions had gathered together.

They had all heard that Yang Kai had been summoned back to the family and naturally wanted to know the reason.

Over a dozen pairs of eyes fixed sharply on Yang Kai, waiting for him to speak. The hall was so quiet that even the sound of a needle dropping could be heard.

“One good piece of news, one bad piece of news,” Yang Kai took a deep breath of Primordial Qi and looked around, saying, “Which would you like to hear first?”

“Since there is both good and bad, let’s start with the bad,” Huo Xingchen smiled and shook his head, “It can’t be worse than what we heard this morning.”

Yang Kai’s expression flickered. Although he did not understand what Huo Xingchen meant, he did not pursue it further. If there was any news in War City, Qiu Yimeng would surely inform him.

“The bad news is that the mansion’s Blood Servants can only have two participate in the succession war. The rest cannot contribute to the battle.”

“What?” Everyone was shocked. Qiu Yimeng’s brows furrowed as she pressed, “What does that mean?”

Yang Kai briefly explained the family’s decision.

After grasping the deeper implications, everyone’s indignation surged, and their faces turned grim.

“What right do they have?” Huo Xingchen shouted angrily. “The Yang Family is taking this too lightly! The rules of the succession war can’t be changed just like that!”

“Indeed, how can this be?”

“This instantly reduced the gap in strength between us and other mansions.”

They all criticized the Yang Family Elder Hall’s decision. Even Han Xiao Qi, normally aloof and cold, showed a trace of anger on her face.

At first, the situation was excellent. With seven Blood Servants on Yang Kai’s side, they could sweep away all enemies. But now, this was impossible.

“Yang Kai, didn’t you try to negotiate with the Elder Hall? These Blood Servants came to follow you voluntarily, yet they are being cut down arbitrarily?” Huo Xingchen was furious.

“Quiet!” Qiu Yimeng took a deep breath of Primordial Qi and gently ordered. She had felt a surge of frustration when she first heard the news earlier. Her heart was secretly angry, but after calming down, she saw that although Yang Kai said this, he showed no displeasure at all.

It was clear he was not concerned with this outcome.

“What’s the good news?” Qiu Yimeng looked at Yang Kai and asked, “Tell us.”

Silence fell suddenly as everyone turned their gaze to Yang Kai.

A faint smile curved his lips as he said calmly, “The good news has nothing to do with you or the succession war. It concerns only myself.”

“From now on, all Blood Servants who come to follow me, both now and in the future, will be under my name and loyal to me alone!”

Everyone’s eyes brightened. Upon reflection, they realized the tremendous advantage hidden in this.

“No way?” Dong Qinghan looked incredulous. “The Yang Family actually agreed to this condition?”

“That’s right.”

“Damn!” Huo Xingchen was stunned.

Qiu Yimeng smiled softly and slowly shook her head. “Yang Kai, you really hit the jackpot.”

All the Blood Servants who joined now and in the future would pledge allegiance solely to Yang Kai. This meant that no matter whether he won the succession war, his standing within the Yang Family would be assuredly high!

With so many Blood Servants as his followers, how low could his status be? At the very least, it would be at the elder level!

Being an elder of the Yang Family was akin to leading a first-rate force!

“The family probably felt they had gone too far this time and so agreed to my condition,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “If they hadn’t intervened, I wouldn’t have gotten such a big benefit.”

Qiu Yimeng nodded gently. “In the short term, this is indeed bad news for the succession war, but for your long-term development, it is very advantageous. Anyway, congratulations.”

A chorus of congratulatory voices rose.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. But when he read the expressions of the others, he noticed a trace of worry hidden between their brows and asked curiously, “Did something happen last night?”

He had only been gone for one night, and yet their expressions had changed so much. Something major must have occurred during that time.

Everyone coughed lightly and sat upright with solemn faces.

Qiu Yimeng smiled wryly, “Nothing escapes you. I was just about to tell you.”

She sighed with Primordial Qi and said, “Like you, I have a good piece of news and a bad piece of news. Which do you want to hear first?”

“The bad news!” Yang Kai’s countenance turned serious.

“Yang Ying... has withdrawn!”

“What?” Yang Kai was shocked.

“You heard right. Your Seventh Brother, Yang Ying, withdrew just last night!”

“What happened?” Yang Kai knitted his brows. This was unexpected.

The succession war had reached the point where only four of the Eight Eldest Young Masters remained.

Yang Wei, Yang Zhao, Yang Kai, and Yang Ying! Among these four, Yang Kai gathered the most experts in his mansion. Just the seven Blood Servants already exceeded many, not to mention the Earth Demon and Meng Wuya.

Besides that, Yang Ying had the greatest number and assistance. No one else could compare.

After all, on the night when Yang Kai raided Yang Shen’s mansion and seized the command flag, all of Yang Shen’s forces, except for two Blood Servants, had rallied to Yang Ying’s mansion.

Yang Ying essentially controlled the support of two eldest young masters!

No matter how one looked at it, Yang Ying was not the weakest among the four.

Yet he voluntarily withdrew! This was beyond everyone’s expectations—and it happened the night Yang Kai left War City.

“I don’t know the full details either,” Qiu Yimeng shook her head. “I only learned about it this morning. Apparently, your Second Brother went alone to Yang Ying’s mansion and talked with him all night. No one knows what benefits or conditions he promised, but Yang Ying chose to withdraw.”

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he spoke in a low voice, “So, the people under Seventh Brother…”

“Are already at your Second Brother’s mansion,” Qiu Yimeng said with a bitter smile.

After absorbing Yang Ying’s forces, Yang Zhao’s mansion had grown immensely! Unlike Yang Kai, Yang Zhao was now the most well-armed.

“What a night of swirling winds and thunder,” Yang Kai’s expression darkened as he coldly chuckled.

He was only gone for one night, yet War City had undergone such great changes. Second Brother had seized a great opportunity!

If he hadn’t been summoned by the Elder Hall yesterday, by now Yang Kai would have taken the seven Blood Servants and been conquering north and south.

Yet now, this situation had completely wiped out his advantage. Instead, he had to be wary of any moves from Second Brother.

The situation turned on a dime, the great disparity making it difficult to bear.

He had been summoned by the Elder Hall last night, and that same night, Second Brother made his major move. Whether coincidence or not, Yang Kai did not know.

But now, the progression of the succession war had become uncertain. At least, Yang Zhao’s faction had become a hard nut to crack. The eldest brother would also be difficult to deal with.

Who among the three remaining brothers would win was a matter that attracted the entire realm’s attention.

“What about the good news?” Yang Kai calmed his mind and asked.

“This good news isn’t actually that good for you now,” Qiu Yimeng said with a trace of helplessness and clapped her hands. “Come in.”

Two people entered at the door.

Yang Kai looked at them briefly and immediately understood what Qiu Yimeng meant.

These were the two Blood Servants who had followed Seventh Brother.

Now that Yang Ying had withdrawn, they had the chance to choose their allegiance again! Like the others, they had come to follow Yang Kai.

But because Yang Kai had agreed to the Elder Hall’s demand, these two could not contribute to the succession war.

“Wu Ju, Fu Cong, pay respects to Young Master!”"

Yang Kai nodded gently, “You heard what I just said, right?”

“We heard it,” the two nodded and smiled. “From now on, please take care of us, Young Master.”

“The feeling is mutual!”

“At your service!” After greeting Yang Kai, they immediately withdrew.

“What do you plan to do next?” Qiu Yimeng asked softly once the two Blood Servants had departed.

“We'll assess the situation,” Yang Kai said helplessly. Although the forces he controlled were not weak, losing so many Blood Servants meant he could no longer act recklessly, especially since Yang Zhao now was strong and needed to be guarded against carefully.

Such grand changes overnight reminded one how unpredictable the world was.

Though many felt sympathy for Yang Kai, considering he now directly commanded so many Blood Servants, the mood lightened somewhat.

After dispersing, everyone returned to their cultivation.

Yang Kai gathered all the Blood Servants together.

Including the two who just joined this morning, there were nine Blood Servants in the mansion! This number was formidable.

The Elder Hall’s meaning was clear. Many masters of the Blood Servants Hall already knew this from the mouths of Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian.

Looking over the powerful figures before him, Yang Kai said, “Out of you nine, I can only select two to participate in the succession war. Ying Jiu has always guarded my safety and specialized in covert assassination. No one among you compares to him, so he’s chosen. As for Yuxian, she excels in soul techniques and is the only woman here, so she is also chosen. I hope you bear no grudges.”

“We would never dare!” the group said in unison.

“I knew you wouldn’t.” Yang Kai nodded. “Actually, I also chose Yuxian for another reason...”

Everyone became curious.

Yang Kai smiled, “I just want to be near a beauty.”

Though Tang Yuxian was calm and experienced, she couldn’t help but blush and shyly say, “Young Master…”

The group's expressions instantly turned ambiguous.

Yang Kai became serious and didn’t say anything more. He continued, “Although the remaining seven won’t be able to contribute in the succession war, they can teach the martial artists in the mansion how to cultivate during their free time.”

“No problem.” Tu Feng nodded.

All of them were experts from the Yang Family Blood Servants Hall, each possessing cultivation at the seventh or eighth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Guiding the mansion’s martial artists was a trivial matter.

No doubt those martial artists would be overjoyed; receiving instruction from the Yang Family Blood Servants was a rare opportunity.
