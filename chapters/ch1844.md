## Chapter 1844 — I’ve Long Heard Your Renown

The man’s arrival was so quiet that no one knew when he had come; it was as if he had always stood there. He wore an armored breastplate that emitted potent fluctuations, bore a long spear across his shoulder, and had his hair bound with a jade crown—majestic and imposing, like a great general who had carved his dominion on the battlefield and looked down upon all around him.

The aura radiating from him made everyone feel breathless.

With nothing but his presence he had forced the group from the Commerce Guild back and even left them secretly wounded, yet his attention was not on Gao Hong and the others; instead his face was grave as he fixed his gaze on the pavilion room where Yang Kai sat.

“Void King Realm!” Gao Hong’s complexion drained as she cried out.

The aura on the man’s body was completely unrestrained — it was unmistakably the pressure belonging only to a Void King Realm master. This realization made her heart sink to the depths; she knew that the Commerce Guild was truly doomed this time.

“Ah!” A sharp scream burst forth as Bai Zhengchu was hurled from the room like a ripped burlap sack, bloodied and battered—far worse off than Xia Jingwu and Yao Qing—his face swollen into a comical pig-like mask.

“You filth, you dare disturb my cultivation—damn you!” Yang Kai’s displeased voice floated from inside the room, outrageously arrogant.

Bai Zhengchu had been beaten badly but he was alive; upon hearing Yang Kai’s words he shuddered, scrambled to his feet, and was about to flee when a cold snort came from the sky. He froze and looked up to see the general-like warrior regarding him with disdain.

Bai Zhengchu’s expression changed wildly, then brightened; he tumbled toward the man, prostrating himself as he cried, “Commander, I salute you, Commander! Please, Commander, judge this matter for us. There’s a bastard in that room who struck people at the city gate—when I heard I came to set things right, but he refused to cooperate and struck again. I lack skill and could not contend with him; Commander, please uphold the prestige of Purple Star City!”

“Understood.” The general-like warrior snorted and waved a hand. “You may withdraw. This person is of the Void King Realm; you are clearly no match for him.”

“Voi—Void King Realm!” Bai Zhengchu bit his tongue, eyes wide with terror. He had suspected it, but to hear the commander say it himself filled him with fresh dread.

He had just sparred with someone of the Void King Realm and come away intact—he had not been obliterated or perished.

At that thought he could not help but feel a bit pleased with himself.

The Commerce Guild members stood stupefied. Hua Youmeng, cradled in Gao Hong’s arms, widened her beautiful eyes as if she could not believe what she’d heard—good heavens, that young man was a Void King Realm expert? He looked hardly older than a youth; how could he be a Void King Realm powerhouse?

The thought that she had stuck her neck out for him at the city gate made Hua Youmeng’s cheeks flush hot.

He was already a Void King Realm expert, and she had so foolishly defended him and stood up for him.

If she had not intervened, with his cultivation the city gate guards and Deacon Min might not have dared to provoke him. After all, a Void King Realm cultivator was a regional powerhouse, and Purple Star would not lightly offend one.

Instead, because she had overstepped, matters had grown more troublesome.

The thought left Hua Youmeng mortified.

Gao Hong, for her part, watched the pavilion room with excitement and expectation; she knew that whether the Commerce Guild would escape this calamity depended entirely on how capable the man inside that room proved to be.

Her plan had been to lure Bai Zhengchu and the others to Yang Kai and have Yang Kai handle them.

Yang Kai had wounded Deacon Min with a single move, showing he was no weakling. Bai Zhengchu and Deacon Min were both Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; if Yang Kai could injure Deacon Min, dealing with Bai Zhengchu would surely be trivial.

Should the two sides clash, regardless of the victor, it would give them a chance to flee.

That was why she had exposed Yang Kai and even secretly signaled Xia Jingwu on the way—Xia Jingwu had understood at once.

Unfortunately, though her plan was sound, another powerhouse had crashed in and cut off their chance to escape.

This man… Gao Hong scanned the general-like warrior and, coupled with Bai Zhengchu’s formality, suddenly understood who he was.

The Purple Star City Guard Commander—Lu Tianfeng!

“At last, someone half-decent has arrived.” Inside the room Yang Kai still held his lofty tone, as if Lu Tianfeng were beneath his notice.

Hearing this, a flicker of displeasure crossed Lu Tianfeng’s face as he snorted coldly. “Half-decent? Quite the arrogance in your tone.”

“Why don’t you try me, and find out just how arrogant I am?” Yang Kai said with a dark grin.

“Who are you, friend, and why do you behave so in my Purple Star City?” Lu Tianfeng frowned, surprisingly cautious rather than angry.

Anyone who had cultivated to the Void King Realm was no fool; to behave so brazenly after knowing this place was Purple Star City and to show such contempt for him meant they either had tremendous power or a powerful backer.

Lu Tianfeng, as the Guard Commander, could not fail to see this.

His demeanor grew wary.

“If you want to know who I am, come down and speak to me—aren’t you tired standing up there so high?”

Lu Tianfeng’s face chilled. “Are you provoking me, sir?”

“What, Commander Lu lacks the courage?”

“What a joke!” Lu Tianfeng burst into laughter. “You think such childish tricks could fool this Commander? But since you’re so calm and fearless, I’d really like to see just who you are. If you turn out to be some blind fool or wild demon who doesn’t know his place, hehe… then don’t blame Lu for showing no mercy.”

As he spoke, he leveled his spear, a torrential aura surging from him as he took one deliberate step after another toward the ground below.

Everyone held their breath, not daring to exhale, eyes wide as they awaited the impending storm—after all, it was a conflict between two Void King Realm experts; who had ever witnessed such a clash?

Before long Lu Tianfeng reached the door and, bold and skilled, pushed it open and entered.

The door creaked… and then closed again.

Silence filled the room; even outside one could hear a pin drop.

There were no sounds of combat, not even the murmur of argument.

The atmosphere grew eerie, heavy enough that everyone could hear their own hearts hammering; Bai Zhengchu cupped an ear and leaned close, straining to catch any hint of noise.

The Commerce Guild members exchanged baffled looks, all at a loss to understand what was happening.

A full tea later the door opened again.

Lu Tianfeng stepped out with a solemn expression. In full view of all he turned, carefully closed the door once more, and bowed: “Very well—please rest early, sir. I shall come to call upon you again tomorrow.”

“No need. I like my privacy.” Yang Kai’s voice came from within.

“Yes!” Lu Tianfeng answered respectfully.

“You may withdraw for now. By the way, the Commerce Guild’s backyard was damaged by your men causing a disturbance…”

“Fear not, sir. I will give you a satisfactory accounting.” Lu Tianfeng said in a low voice.

“Someone was injured as well…”

“I will deal with it sternly!”

“Good.”

The room fell silent. Lu Tianfeng turned solemnly on the spot.

Everyone’s mouths hung open in stupefaction.

What in Heaven was going on?

Lu Tianfeng, the famed Purple Star City Guard Commander and a dominant figure in the region, had treated the man inside that room with such deference and obedience—who was this person?

The Commerce Guild men could hardly think straight; the bald strongman Yao Qing rubbed his eyes as if his wounds had produced hallucinations.

“Commander… Commander!” Bai Zhengchu rushed forward, kowtowing and fawning.

Lu Tianfeng fixed him with a cold gaze that made Bai Zhengchu shrink back—he felt something was wrong.

“We’ll settle this later!” Lu Tianfeng ground his teeth and snorted.

Bai Zhengchu’s head buzzed and he was completely bewildered.

“May I ask who is in charge here?” Lu Tianfeng turned his face to Gao Hong with a suddenly genial smile and cupped his hands in greeting; the smile carried a hint of obsequiousness.

The Commerce Guild folk felt stupefied, unable to respond.

Only when Lu Tianfeng politely asked again did Gao Hong tremble and set Hua Youmeng down from her arms, letting her lean on her shoulder as she said, “This is our Commerce Guild’s president. Commander Lu, what words do you have?”

“Not at all, not at all!” Lu Tianfeng rubbed his hands. The spear he had gripped earlier was nowhere to be seen—collected back into concealment—and he smiled brightly at Hua Youmeng, asking in a low voice, “May I know how this lady is addressed?”

Hua Youmeng replied softly, “I am Hua Youmeng. Commander may simply call me by my name. Please forgive me, my lord — I’m not in a condition to offer a proper salute right now.”

“Ah, President Hua—I’ve long heard your renown!” Lu Tianfeng looked genuinely astonished, as though Hua Youmeng’s name struck him like thunder. Hua Youmeng grew dizzy at his reaction, but Lu Tianfeng did not notice and continued cheerfully, “President Hua’s—uh—”

“The Commerce Guild!” Bai Zhengchu hurriedly prompted from the side.

“Yes—President Hua’s Commerce Guild. I have heard much of it. Honest trade, fair dealings—truly a model among the guilds. To meet you in person today is as glorious as the tales, ha ha ha!”

The relentless flattery left Hua Youmeng blushing.

Gao Hong and the others wore similarly uncomfortable expressions.

They knew the true state of their Commerce Guild: small, thin in influence, with few warriors. In the whole of Purple Star City there were no fewer than eight to ten thousand guilds like theirs. What sort of figure was Lu Tianfeng? He was the exalted Guard Commander—how could he be so familiar with the Commerce Guild’s reputation? The heavy praise felt like a weight pressing on their necks, making them almost ashamed.

Yet everyone knew that Lu Tianfeng’s shift in demeanor had everything to do with that youth inside the room!
