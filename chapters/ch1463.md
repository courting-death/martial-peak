## Chapter 1463 — Space Rift

Jin Shi, confident in his own strength, believed he could pluck Yang Kai's head off in the blink of an eye.

If he could kill Yang Kai, that emerald great dragon would naturally be rendered useless, and beyond that he could seize that piece of Xuan Gold; the Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art might then be perfected, and once that happened, surpassing the Sect Master and taking control of the Demon Blood Sect would not be impossible.

One stroke to gain many things — the crucial point was whether Yang Kai lived or died.

With this in mind Jin Shi's blood boiled; without hesitation he waved his hand and sent a spray of fine, hairlike needle-shaped Secret Treasures tearing through the void toward Yang Kai. These Secret Treasures aren't notable for single-target power, but they excel at concealment—perfect for a sneak attack. And though their individual lethality was limited, anyone struck by them would still suffer dearly.

After all, each needle-shaped Secret Treasure flickered with interleaved green-and-black light, clearly suffused with potent poison.

Watching those needle-shaped Secret Treasures rush at him, Yang Kai unhurriedly flicked his hand; a purple shield materialized before him. A moment later the metallic clatter rang out—facing his Upper-Level Origin-Grade defensive Secret Treasure, those needles could not pierce its defense and thus could not inflict effective harm on Yang Kai.

But that was enough.

Jin Shi had not launched those needles to truly harm Yang Kai, but to draw his attention.

His wings, thin as cicada wings, trembled once and the man strangely vanished from his spot; in an instant he surged to a position five zhang to Yang Kai's side, moving with astonishing speed!

A feral, scheming smile on his face, Jin Shi sneered, "Boy, you're still a bit green to spar with me!"

As his words fell, his Shi erupted. An invisible quagmire formed beside Yang Kai, causing Yang Kai's movements to falter. Shi, as a force, though broadly similar, differs subtly from person to person.

Jin Shi's Shi carried a bloody aura that wrapped him like a shroud. It felt as if one had fallen into a pool of blood: movement became hindered, Saint Yuan circulation went awry, and there was a choking sensation as the bloody scent seeped through the pores into the body, dragging out the warrior's deepest savagery and unsettling his mind.

Once Yang Kai was struck, his eyes turned bloodshot, his face strained, his breathing faintly quickened, and Biluo, standing beside him, could barely utter a sound; her body went slack and she collapsed into Yang Kai's arms.

She had not yet healed from her grievous injuries and could not engage in combat—let alone face a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert like Jin Shi.

"Just having broken through to the Origin Returning Realm and already so insolent—let me show you what the true Origin Returning Realm is!" Jin Shi declared proudly, reaching out with his only hand, scales and armor covering it. It looked hideous and terrifying, but undeniably possessed dreadful strength.

His plan was simple: use his Shi to subdue or kill Yang Kai in one strike.

After all, the last time in Dragon Lair Mountain he had seen Yang Kai at only the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; although Yang Kai had now broken into the Origin Returning Realm, he certainly had not had time to refine his Shi—in other words, the difference from the Saint King Realm was merely an elevation in cultivation, not a fundamental change.

To use one's strength against the other's weakness—Jin Shi's thinking was sound.

Good as the idea was, he could never have imagined that in such a short time Yang Kai's Shi had already taken shape and was in no way inferior to that of any veteran Origin Returning Realm expert steeped in that domain for years.

Just as that great hand was about to seize Yang Kai, the corner of Yang Kai's mouth twitched into a mocking smile; the panic fled his eyes and was replaced by absolute calm.

Seeing this, Jin Shi's heart lurched; an instinctive sense of dread spread through him like never before.

Before he could determine whether Yang Kai was bluffing or truly confident, a wondrous power leisurely unfurled from Yang Kai, enveloping him and sweeping away his Shi.

Crack... crack...

The sound from the depths of his mind made Jin Shi's face change; as that wondrous power swept past, he was horrified to discover his Shi collapsing inch by inch, unable to hold.

At the same time, the surrounding space seemed to twist and contort, giving Jin Shi the sensation of being exiled into the void; the things before his eyes folded and warped into unrecognizable shapes.

That brat had been right in front of him a moment ago, yet in the blink of an eye he was far away.

"Impossible!" Jin Shi cried, his eyelids twitching.

With his sight he immediately perceived that Yang Kai had also released his Shi, and that it was stronger and stranger than his own; otherwise it could not have shattered his Shi.

What power had been fused into that shi? Why did it cause space itself to contort? Jin Shi's outstretched hand was only three cun from Yang Kai, yet he could not continue: in his vision Yang Kai's position had been turned inside out and he could not be sure a single strike would kill him.

"Spatial Force!"

Yang Kai's Shi had already condensed the subtleties of Spatial Force; wherever his Shi wrapped, the space there would change.

This was something he had comprehended before entering the Imperial Garden, through the power of Imperial Might. Those final days had not been wasted: Imperial Might's strength had forcibly allowed Yang Kai to fuse Spatial Force into his Shi. Though not yet fully mastered, a Shi fused with one's own divine ability was undoubtedly stronger than ordinary Shi.

The present scene was the best proof: this was Yang Kai's first time using his Shi to contend with someone, and his expectations had been high—now the results were indeed remarkable.

To be fair, Jin Shi's strength was considerable—renowned for years and having reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. If it came to a true fight, killing him would be troublesome, especially in this special environment with Biluo needing care and the opponent having an equal-grade assistant.

Those constraints forced Yang Kai to feign weakness, deliberately drawing Jin Shi in. When facing the Demon Blood Sect chief's first strike, Yang Kai produced the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade as planned, its purpose to make Jin Shi lower his guard.

The other party indeed grew complacent, thinking that without the Dragon Bone Sword and its Artifact Spirit Yang Kai was a soft target, and dared to press right up to him!

Yang Kai would not miss such an opportunity. His figure flickered, Spatial Force surged, he vanished from his original spot, and when he reappeared he was startlingly behind Jin Shi.

This was not a visual illusion caused by speed, but true instantaneous movement.

Within the area wrapped by his Shi Yang Kai could do this; unfortunately his Shi covered only a radius of less than thirty zhang, so he could only teleport within that small range—yet even that was extraordinary.

Jin Shi still held his forward posture, utterly uncomprehending.

Yang Kai flicked his hand and a pitch-black, blade-like attack formed; with a slight tremor it shot forth like an arrow loosed from a string toward Jin Shi.

"Space Blade!"

Against a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm opponent Yang Kai would not withhold; he intended to kill with a single blow.

The Space Blade lived up to expectation, carving a crescent-shaped hole in Jin Shi's back and passing through his body.

"Eh?" Yang Kai was not elated but rather astonished; he immediately turned and glanced to one side, seeing a disheveled figure emerge—Jin Shi himself, pale and shaken, seeming to have suffered a severe loss of Yuan Qi.

At the spot where he had stood, a figure of Jin Shi still remained—his body upright and motionless. A crescent-shaped wound gaped across his back and abdomen, yet, strangely, not a single drop of blood flowed out.

With a tearing, rending sound...

That Jin Shi figure actually collapsed and dispersed, dissolving into nothingness.

"Golden Cicada Shell?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, extremely surprised.

He had only spoken offhandedly; after all, the old man's cultivated art was the Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art—and unexpectedly his guess had hit the mark.

Jin Shi's secret move was indeed called Golden Cicada Shell, an ultimate escape technique; since cultivating the Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art, Jin Shi had relied on this move to evade several fatal blows.

When Yang Kai's Space Blade left his hand, Jin Shi instinctively sensed danger and immediately employed the secret technique, thereby snatching back his life.

Though formidable, this trick bore many limits: aside from consuming Yuan Qi, once used he could not engage in combat again for a short while.

In other circumstances Jin Shi might indeed have succeeded.

But within this Ice Path the narrow space meant that even if he fled he could not get far.

What made him even more desperate was that he stood within Yang Kai's Shi and could no longer judge spatial positions. He had assumed he would be farther from Yang Kai and be able to find a chance to unite with the Sect Master, but once he freed himself and looked, Yang Kai was startlingly within less than ten zhang at his side.

Jin Shi nearly swore; in all his life he'd never seen such a strange Shi.

"Interesting!" Yang Kai grinned, his smile uncanny, further strengthening his control over his Shi. In an instant the warped space began to slowly collapse. Centered on Yang Kai, within a radius of thirty zhang, wherever the Shi wrapped, one after another tiny space-rifts appeared—fine as ox-hair. Though they would soon be repaired by the local heavenly laws, they sprang up in unbroken succession.

Seeing Jin Shi pale and helpless, Yang Kai extended a hand, slowly closed his fist, and softly commanded, "Close!"

The space-rifts obeyed his order and converged on Jin Shi's location, dense and writhing like countless little snakes, a ghastly sight.

Poor Jin Shi, once the great elder of the Demon Blood Sect and a mighty Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator, was driven to such a desperate plight; watching the space-rifts close in from all sides with no place to flee, his face finally broke into panic as he cried out, "Wait, Sect Master Yang, have mercy!"
