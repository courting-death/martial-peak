## Chapter 1456 — The Pursued Woman

Yang Kai had once asked Qian Tong to sniff around about the Blood Essence Stone, but even with the backing of Yingyue Hall, they had found nothing—so it was a surprise to discover one here, deep within the Imperial Garden.

How could he not be delighted?

In an instant, Yang Kai had already treated that Blood Essence Stone as if it were his own possession!

First, however, he had to find a way to resolve the crisis facing the three people from Qiantian Sect. With that thought, Yang Kai looked back toward the battlefield.

The Qiantian Sect had three people while their foes numbered four, putting them at a numerical disadvantage; their ability to hold on this long was entirely down to the formidable cultivations of Gu Zhen and Mo Yu.

Gu Zhen, as the sect master, was naturally not to be underestimated; now he was single‑handedly taking on two enemies—one at the Third Stage and one at the Second Stage—while Mo Yu was locked in a one‑on‑one struggle with another Third Stage opponent.

As for Shen Shitao, she darted about at Mo Yu’s side, chased by the remaining Second Stage attacker; she had no power to strike back, only using the Nine Palace Sky‑Net Umbrella to block incoming blows, her pretty face full of anxiety.

After a moment’s observation, Yang Kai decided to make Mo Yu the fulcrum of his breakthrough—if he could free Mo Yu, the fight here would be decided without question.

With that thought, Yang Kai ceased hiding his presence; he pushed off with his feet and smashed straight through the window.

Once airborne he released the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, and in an instant the temperature throughout the palace shot upward.

Both sides in the conflict turned pale and glanced over. They were already fighting fiercely—who would have expected someone to barge in now? Everyone worried the newcomer might be the other side’s reinforcement.

They saw a bizarre fire‑red Fire Bird, its whole body blazing like a lump of flame, hurtling toward them. It gave a sharp cry; its beak opened and it spat out basin‑sized fireballs, unbearably scorching and terrifying.

Mo Yu’s eyes narrowed, but he soon showed mixed surprise and joy.

He had been at the battle on Dragon Lair Mountain and had a deep impression of the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit; seeing it now he immediately concluded Yang Kai had arrived.

Not the enemy’s reinforcement but his own! Mo Yu rejoiced inwardly; with his heart eased he struck all the harder, without holding back.

The four on the other side wore uneasy expressions; sensing the Fire Bird’s power, each looked grim.

Yang Kai, who burst forth from hiding behind the Fire Bird, was barely taken seriously by them.

In a flash the Fire Bird’s fireballs rained down above Mo Yu’s opponent; the terrifying force contained in each scorched him, and he hastily backed away to estrange himself from Mo Yu. Spinning in place, a ring of milky white mist oozed from his body, enveloping the area around him for several zhang.

Whatever method it was, it seemed to grant formidable defense at first glance.

Boom, boom, boom……

The fireballs arrived as expected, all blasting into the milky-white mist, scattering it apart and revealing the figure of a cultivator hidden within. Yet, to Yang Kai’s surprise, the man was completely unscathed. Moreover, the dispersed mist seemed to writhe with a life of its own, squirming to mend the gap that had just been blown open.

At that moment a swift shaft of golden light shot out from behind the Fire Bird and plunged toward the man’s chest and abdomen.

Yang Kai had acted—he released the Fire Bird to draw attention, and hiding behind it he had only come for this single strike; he would not miss such a rare opportunity.

He did not know exactly what wonder the other had used for his defense, but he was determined not to allow that mist to knit itself back together.

The Golden Blood Threads were razor‑keen and blisteringly fast, and carried strong concealment; only when the golden light reached within sight did the man sense it, give an exclamation, and swing a long halberd‑like Secret Treasure in an attempt to block the Golden Blood Threads.

But it was already too late.

With a soft pop the Golden Blood Threads pierced through the man’s lower abdomen, the golden strands emerging from the other side of his body and immediately binding him tight.

At that moment the Fire Bird spread its wings and swooped down upon him.

Mo Yu, who had been fighting this man, thrust out a huge hand that seemed to stretch on forever, becoming an enormous palm that slammed down upon him.

The man had nowhere to dodge; in an instant he was swallowed by raging flames and the palm imprint, screams issuing forth and then abruptly cut off.

When the palm and flames dispersed and the Fire Bird soared up, all that remained on the spot was a charred corpse.

A Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert had been extinguished in an instant!

Yang Kai’s sneak attack played its part, but the Artifact Spirit and Mo Yu’s great killing power were the main reasons—without them the single strike of the Golden Blood Threads alone could not have slain the man.

Having slain one enemy, Yang Kai wasted no time; with a thought he commanded the Fire Bird to target the two fighting Gu Zhen, while Mo Yu rushed at the Second Stage opponent who had been pursuing Shen Shitao.

For a moment Qiantian Sect’s momentum surged, the defenders becoming the aggressors.

Their foes were taken aback. The surviving Third Stage cultivator, seeing the Artifact Spirit was not to be trifled with, showed a flicker of unwillingness, and barked, “Retreat!”

But by then it was undoubtedly late to flee.

At least the two Second Stage Origin Returning Realm warriors could not escape. Mo Yu, with superior cultivation, forcibly intercepted one and slew him without much trouble.

The other was entangled and finished by Yang Kai and the Artifact Spirit; he too could not evade doom.

The Third Stage man, however, truly was powerful; after taking a blow from Gu Zhen he took advantage of the chance to flee and vanished in an instant. Gu Zhen, unwilling to let him go, gave chase.

The battle, after Yang Kai’s intervention, ended in less than the time it takes for a cup of tea to cool, and it concluded with a sweeping victory for Qiantian Sect—an outcome that surprised even Mo Yu.

Seeing Yang Kai retract the Artifact Spirit, Mo Yu hurried over with Shen Shitao to offer thanks.

“Sect Master Yang, to meet you here is unexpected—Mo is ashamed; your great kindness will be remembered.”

“Elder Mo, there’s no need for such formality. I simply happened to arrive. I can see your Saint Yuan has been heavily drained—recovering that is important. I will guard for you.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Sect Master Yang, thank you!” Mo Yu was not a man of many words; understanding the importance of replenished Saint Yuan, he and Shen Shitao moved aside, took pills, produced a Saint Crystal, and sat to recuperate.

Gu Zhen had not yet returned, and Yang Kai did not hesitate—he leapt to the altar‑like structure and beamed at the heart‑sized Blood Essence Stone.

This thing was not to be taken casually; whatever the altar‑like contraption was for, it had been set with many protections. Beyond the Blood Essence Stone itself a thin membrane of shielding covered it; to obtain the Blood Essence Stone one had to first break through that layer.

Since Yang Kai desired the Blood Essence Stone, he would not be sloppy—he flung out the Golden Blood Threads and struck at that membrane.

In an instant the membrane shimmered with light. That seemingly fragile, easily‑breakable skin proved unexpectedly sturdy, much to Yang Kai’s surprise.

But it was still a dead object; even without going all out Yang Kai’s relentless bombardment could not be held forever. After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the membrane shattered and Yang Kai snatched the Blood Essence Stone, examining it closely and finding it nearly identical to the Blood Essence Stone he had once obtained by chance on Tongxuan Continent.

The second Stone Puppet might now be born; Yang Kai grinned broadly and stowed it away happily.

Looking around, Mo Yu and Shen Shitao were still recuperating, and Gu Zhen, who had chased after that fleeing enemy, had yet to return.

The commotion over Yang Kai taking the Blood Essence Stone had of course reached Mo Yu’s ears, but he had nothing to complain about—if Yang Kai had not arrived, the three from Qiantian Sect would have been in dire straits, and at the very least Shen Shitao would have been lost; not to mention the matter of the treasure.

By both reason and sentiment, Yang Kai had the right to take that Blood Essence Stone.

The palace fell quiet; as Yang Kai’s gaze wandered he suddenly noticed a woman lying on her side in a corner of the great hall.

When he had peered into the palace from outside earlier, Yang Kai had seen this woman, though he had not known whether she was dead or alive, for she had not stirred until now.

Curiosity pricked Yang Kai: only three people from Qiantian Sect should have entered—could this woman be an accomplice of the four attackers?

With that thought he strode over to her. As he neared he extended his Divine Sense to sweep her body.

Yang Kai was somewhat surprised by what he found.

The woman was not dead, though clearly grievously wounded, her breath faint and threadlike. Her cultivation was not high; she, like him, was only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

What could someone of such cultivation be doing running in here? Yang Kai shook his head inwardly—people die for wealth, birds die for food.

Approaching the woman’s side, Yang Kai glanced over and saw that her complexion was deathly pale, with traces of dried blood still at the corners of her lips. Aside from that, there were no visible wounds—clearly, her internal organs had suffered grievous damage.

Her black hair fell over her face, obscuring whether she was beautiful or ugly.

“Old Man Mo and I were just studying how to break the restriction on that altar when this woman suddenly rushed in in a panic. Those four just now—she led them here,” Gu Zhen said. At some point, he had already returned, but judging from his frustrated expression, it was clear he hadn’t managed to catch the last fleeing enemy. After all, their cultivation was on par with his; if the man’s sole intent was to escape, there was nothing Gu Zhen could do.

“So she wasn’t an accomplice of the four?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

Gu Zhen slowly shook his head. “She should have been fleeing from pursuit.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai was surprised—he had intended to finish the wounded woman while she was vulnerable, assuming she was allied with the four. Now, knowing the truth, he could not bring himself to be so ruthless.
