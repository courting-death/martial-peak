## Chapter 1185 — If You Don't Want to Die, Then Leave Quickly

After searching for about the time it takes a stick of incense to burn, Yang Kai ran out of the dug‑out pit, his face utterly listless.

He found that hunting for Fire-Glow Crystals here was entirely a matter of luck.

The fire‑type Spiritual Qi in this place was so dense that the aura of the Fire-Glow Crystals was completely concealed; one could not probe it with Divine Sense, so searching had to rely on chance, which thoroughly dampened Yang Kai's interest.

These cultivators would be tempted by Origin‑Grade Upper‑Level materials, but Yang Kai would not — there was no reason to waste time here over a few Fire-Glow Crystals.

Better to go to the heaven‑and‑earth treasure area, he thought, and with that Yang Kai no longer felt like digging.

Before leaving, Yang Kai casually glanced at the middle‑aged man and was surprised to see their luck had exploded; the Senior Brother and his Junior both wore joyous expressions, clearly having made a considerable haul.

Not disturbing them further, Yang Kai left the hill alone; as he walked ahead he kept running into warriors who had gotten the news and were rushing toward him, people constantly pulling him to ask this and that, which vexed him greatly.

These people plainly saw Yang Kai was alone and not of high cultivation, so they didn't take him seriously; otherwise they wouldn't behave like this.

But they were only asking questions, and Yang Kai could not massacre them, so he simply avoided them while walking.

At this time Yang Kai no longer used his Wind‑and‑Thunder Wings; the area was filling with people, and the Wings were too conspicuous — if seen they might stir trouble. Yang Kai wasn't afraid of trouble, but he didn't want to invite any, so he traveled on foot honestly, and his speed was not slow.

Two days later, while Yang Kai was on the road, he suddenly heard the rustle of garments behind him, as if someone was sprinting with all their might.

From the sound it seemed that person was heading straight in his direction; Yang Kai frowned and stopped, turning to look back.

In an instant a figure bounded over the rises of the hill and landed before Yang Kai.

When their eyes met, Yang Kai instantly recognized him — it was the middle‑aged man he'd encountered a few days before, his face like polished jade, a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. Yang Kai felt rather favorably toward this chance acquaintance; after all, the man had once offered him a word of counsel and seemed to have a good heart.

Yang Kai couldn't help but let out a short laugh and was about to greet him, but his expression suddenly darkened.

He noticed the man was not right: the man's Saint Yuan was in disorder, his face panic‑stricken and tense, and he appeared wounded — a gash on his shoulder bled through, dyeing half his robe red.

Moreover, his eyes were blood‑red, full of fury and unwillingness.

When the middle‑aged man saw Yang Kai he was slightly stunned, as if he hadn't expected anyone here; guilt and regret flashed through his eyes. He stamped his foot and cried urgently, "If you don't want to die, then leave quickly!"

Having said that, he did not linger; he twisted his body and darted off to the left.

Yang Kai was bewildered, but he quickly understood: no more than thirty breaths after the middle‑aged man fled, a group of four or five warriors in dark green robes had caught up to where Yang Kai stood.

The leader was a young man of roughly Yang Kai's apparent age, though his true age was unclear; his face was cold and his cultivation reached the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. The few following him, both men and women, were all at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm.

At the sight of the youth, Yang Kai found him very familiar, as if he'd seen him somewhere before.

While Yang Kai was wondering, the youth brusquely demanded in a low voice, "Speak — which direction did that man run?"

Yang Kai's face went cold; the other's curt manner of questioning irritated him. Not only had Yang Kai had a casual acquaintance with that middle‑aged man and would not betray him, but even if a stranger, he would not answer such interrogation.

"Senior Brother Meng, over here!" a woman among them, dressed like a young married lady, suddenly pointed to the side — the direction the middle‑aged man had fled, for there were several conspicuous drops of blood there.

"Hmph!" the youth called Senior Brother Meng snorted coldly, and with the others hurried off in pursuit; before leaving he waved his hand and a shaft of golden light suddenly shot toward Yang Kai.

Enraged, Yang Kai thrust his hand forward and a Vast Heaven Shield manifested in front of him to block the attack.

But the Vast Heaven Shield he had condensed with his Saint Yuan failed to fully withstand the golden beam; with a crisp crack the shield nearly shattered.

Yang Kai was stunned. When he came to himself the others had already run far off. Senior Brother Meng seemed surprised he hadn't slain a First Stage of the Saint King Realm like Yang Kai with one blow; he turned and coldly stared at Yang Kai as if memorizing his face.

But right now pursuing that middle‑aged man was the pressing matter, so he did not tarry to trouble Yang Kai further.

In an instant the four or five had gone off in the direction the middle‑aged man had fled.

Yang Kai stood where he was and thought carefully. He felt he'd seen that youth somewhere before — otherwise he wouldn't have found him familiar. After a moment he finally recalled and, his heart stirring, he hurried after the direction they had gone.

Whether it was because of the youth himself or because of that middle‑aged man he'd briefly met, Yang Kai was not prepared to let the matter go.

The middle‑aged man had indeed been decent: he had kindly advised Yang Kai before, and when he ran into Yang Kai earlier had still taken time to urge him to leave, his eyes revealing clear guilt — clearly he felt responsible for having run into Yang Kai and thus involving him, which was why he'd altered his escape route.

Since the man bore goodwill, Yang Kai naturally intended to return the favor.

After a short chase, they easily caught up.

The middle‑aged man was already at the end of his strength and could not run far. Senior Brother Meng was now leading several junior brothers and sisters in surrounding attacks. The man's cultivation was low, but the defensive treasure armor he wore was quite good, deflecting many lethal strikes.

Even so, that defensive armor was now nearly dim, its spirit greatly depleted, and it looked as if it would soon fail to protect him.

Senior Brother Meng stood there with an air of calm indifference, not joining his comrades in striking; he stood with his hands behind his back, watching coldly, his face full of scorn and mockery.

It was fortunate he hadn't thrown himself into the fray; otherwise the middle‑aged man could not have withstood it.

“Meng Hongliang, may you die a miserable death!” the middle-aged man roared in fury, spitting blood after taking the attack from the young woman who had just spoken.

The words sharpened the eyes of the youth called Meng Hongliang. He coldly ordered, "Don't be hasty in killing him. Play with him properly so he knows what happens to those who offend our Quehe Sect."

"Yes!" the Quehe Sect cultivators surrounding the middle‑aged man responded, immediately slowing their attacks and switching to a cat‑and‑mouse cruelty, inflicting small but painful wounds that would not kill him outright.

"Meng Hongliang, I've already given you the Fire-Glow Crystal Core — why must you pursue complete annihilation? Why kill my Junior Brother?" the middle‑aged man shouted as he dodged desperately, but his wounds multiplied and his face grew pale from blood loss.

"Hmph!" Meng Hongliang snorted coldly. "A Fire-Glow Crystal Core so precious — do you have the qualification to possess it? And such things are best known by as few as possible. Blame your luck: you and your Senior Brother were too fortunate to find such an item, but your luck was poor in that I discovered you. Ha! Only I can possess this Fire-Glow Crystal Core now. You and your Senior Brother can go to Yellow Springs together; it won't be lonely."

"Even as a ghost I will not let you go," the middle‑aged man roared. The remaining glimmer of his treasure armor finally faded, and after one more blow it burst into pieces.

The defensive armor was utterly destroyed, with no hope of repair.

"Kill him, spare us drawn‑out trouble!" Meng Hongliang, no longer in the mood to dally, commanded coldly.

The Quehe Sect disciples surrounding the middle‑aged man instantly became ferocious; each erupted with their Saint Yuan and their killing moves descended upon him.

The middle‑aged man seemed to accept that he could not escape and ceased resisting; before death he still glared with blood‑red eyes at Meng Hongliang, as if to carve his figure into his soul and seek revenge in the next life.

Just as the middle‑aged man was about to be slain, a shield of burning pitch‑black flame mysteriously formed around him, blocking every killing strike.

One Quehe Sect disciple was too late to withdraw and slapped the black fire shield; the shield was unscathed, but the warrior leapt back like a startled rabbit, screaming in agony.

Everyone looked on, their eyes instantly filled with terror and horror.

The burning black flame, with terrifying swiftness, ran along the warrior's palm and surged across his body; where it passed his arm and shoulder they were burned to ashes, and it soon spread to his chest — there was no hope of survival.

"Senior Brother Meng, help!" the warrior cried, realizing the danger; panic‑stricken, he fled toward Meng Hongliang, hoping he would save him.

Would Meng Hongliang let him get close? He feared that peculiar black flame above all else.

Seeing his fellow disciple rush by, Meng Hongliang's face shifted; a flash of ruthlessness crossed his eyes, and he took a few brisk steps back. He raised his hand and a beam of golden light shot into the other warrior's skull. The man who had rushed forward fell to the ground, his eyes bulging, apparently never expecting his Senior Brother to strike him so coldly.

In the blink of an eye his corpse was completely consumed by the Demonic Flame.

The remaining men and women all went pale, partly from the Demonic Flame's overwhelming might and partly from witnessing Meng Hongliang slay a fellow disciple; for a moment they stood motionless, staring at Meng Hongliang with looks of disbelief.
