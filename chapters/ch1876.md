## Chapter 1876 — A Grand Ruckus

Kuang Shizong killed with decisive resolve and carried a wild, ferocious air; he naturally did not take Yang Kai's utterly hollow threat to heart. As he spoke he reached out and aimed a finger at Shen Tu, his posture plainly meaning to send Shen Tu to his death.

Shen Tu’s face went deathly pale as the breath of death closed in around him, his entire being feeling as though it had been plunged into an icy abyss.

At that moment, a mysterious force surged and Yang Kai suddenly vanished from where he stood.

Kuang Shizong's eyes narrowed; the hand he had thrust forth snapped shut into a fist. The formidable power of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm burst forth, roaring toward the void ahead.

At that point, Yang Kai reappeared like a ghost, materializing between him and Shen Tu and the others. His face was grave to the extreme; he pressed his hands together and shoved forward with a great thrust.

Secret art—Exile!

Spatial Force surged. A black hole of void suddenly opened before Kuang Shizong, like a beast's gaping maw trying to swallow him whole. Inside the hole all was chaos and nothingness; even someone as powerful as Kuang Shizong could not help but shiver when he sensed the aura emanating from within.

The mighty strength of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm erupted in full.

Boom……

A tremendous crash resounded as the gaping hole shattered like a mirror struck, cracking inch by inch, but that chaotic Spatial Force splintered outward in all directions, turning into countless assaults that swept toward Kuang Shizong.

"Impertinent youngster!" Kuang Shizong flew into a rage. His body jerked as Saint Yuan surged out, forming a protective barrier to block those chaotic spatial attacks.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh……

The sounds of rending air came, and great crescent-shaped energy strikes sliced forth one after another toward Kuang Shizong.

Secret art—Moon Blade!

Kuang Shizong's eyes narrowed as he felt the enormous killing power contained within the Moon Blades and no longer dared be careless. He opened his mouth and spat out a jade ruyi-like secret treasure, which warped and transformed into a towering bird.

The great beast bore three heads, each as large as a house; its wings beat and gathered the world's wind energies, forming countless Wind Blades that met the Moon Blades.

An explosion of shattering sound rang out as the Moon Blades and Wind Blades formed a dense killing zone in midair that seemed able to shred that swath of sky.

A fist thrust out from the chaotic combat ring and smashed toward Kuang Shizong. Brilliant multicolored light blossomed from the fist—undeniably Yang Kai's undying sword qi.

Kuang Shizong, quick to seize the moment, met the blow with his own punch.

With a bang, Kuang Shizong's body quivered, swaying three times before standing fast. Yang Kai, however, was sent flying backward; he paled in midair and forced Saint Yuan to circulate to dispel the invading energy shock.

Their clash came like thunder. Many people could not clearly make out what had happened; even those elders at the First Stage of the Void King Realm watched in a daze. Only Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming had observed the entire exchange.

Both of them involuntarily drew a breath of cold air and exchanged looks, reading the shock in each other's eyes.

When the two of them had previously joined forces against Yang Kai and been driven back, they already suspected Yang Kai was no ordinary Second Stage of the Void King Realm; they guessed he might be qualified to contend with the Third Stage.

But guesses were only guesses; they could not be relied upon, for none of them could truly perceive how strong someone at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm might be.

And now, that very thing was unfolding before their eyes.

Yang Kai had truly exchanged a few moves with Kuang Shizong. Although he had fallen into the inferior position and taken some minor wounds, there was no sign of losing!

Kuang Shizong was someone who had lived for thousands of years—an ancient monster. The entire Star Domain could scarcely produce more than a handful of people like him. Each of those at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm possessed the power to destroy a star; ordinary people could not fathom their depths. They were the supreme symbol of the Martial Dao, the undefeated legends.

Yet Yang Kai could emerge from a confrontation with such a man intact.

Not only that……

He had even taken those few men from the Hengluo Commerce Guild away in Kuang Shizong's very presence!

This discovery left Li Maoming and Gongsun Liang standing there stunned, repeatedly asking themselves if they could have achieved the same.

The answer was plain—they could not. Had Kuang Shizong unleashed his first strike, they would have already been wounded and forced to retreat.

Above Purple Star City, Kuang Shizong's face flickered. It was not embarrassment or anger but gravity; he stared at Yang Kai without speaking.

Not far opposite him, Yang Kai had placed Shen Tu and the others behind him, wiped blood from the corner of his mouth, lifted his head slightly, and met Kuang Shizong's gaze.

After a long while, Kuang Shizong blurted out, "Spatial Force?"

"Elder, your eyes are indeed keen!" Yang Kai grinned at him.

"You actually know such an obscure power? And you are so proficient!" Kuang Shizong's heart trembled wildly; his eyes nearly popped out.

Kuang Shizong had indeed heard of Spatial Force. Within the Star Domain, and even in Purple Star itself, there were those who dabbled in spatial cultivation, but at most only at the entry level—completely unable to employ Spatial Force in combat.

Yet what Yang Kai had just done clearly showed profound attainments in Spatial Force; otherwise he could not have performed that near-instantaneous displacement, condensed the Moon Blade into a tangible attack, or produced the void black hole.

It was almost unbelievable.

Li Maoming and Gongsun Liang stood frozen as well. Only now did they comprehend that what Yang Kai had employed was that extremely obscure Spatial Force. Realizing this, both men could not help looking ill.

Did that mean Yang Kai had not been using his full strength when he fought them before?

To be two against one and not only fall to the inferior position but also fail to draw out the opponent's true power—this left Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming thoroughly ashamed and full of regret.

"Since you already know, do you still have the confidence to keep me here?" Yang Kai laughed, brimming with arrogant confidence. "If I want to leave, there's no one in this world who can stop me!"

Hearing this, Kuang Shizong actually nodded slightly and said, "Your words are a touch arrogant, but you do indeed have the qualification to say them."

"If the elder already knows, why don't we make a deal? Let today's matter end here. I'll take my friends and leave, and you needn't pursue past grievances, how about it?"

"Don't flatter yourself!" Kuang Shizong sneered. "True, you are adept in Spatial Force, and killing you outright is no longer possible, but that only applies to you alone. You bring along several dead weight companions—do you really have the confidence to escape my pursuit? We're all reasonable people; spare me your games."

Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he looked helpless. "I didn't expect the elder to see through me—what can be done!"

Hearing that, Shen Tu — shielded behind Yang Kai — had a flash of resolve cross his face. He spoke out, “Brother Yang, go. Don’t worry about us. Having been saved by you today, I, Shen Tu, could die without regret.”

"I swear to follow the Second Young Master to my death; the Yellow Springs Road will not be lonely!" the others cried out in turn, their expressions that of those who welcomed death.

Yang Kai turned his head, glanced at them, and smiled faintly. "Rest assured. Now that matters have come to this, I can't simply abandon you. We'll leave together today."

"Leave together?" Kuang Shizong sneered, "You overestimate yourself. Don't be so presumptuous in my Purple Star City!"

As his words fell, he waved his hand. Eight Void King Realm elders from Purple Star flew toward Yang Kai. Li Maoming and Gongsun Liang joined in, and in the blink of an eye ten Void King Realm warriors surrounded Yang Kai and his group with no gaps; not far away Kuang Shizong himself, a Third Stage of the Void King Realm, watched like a tiger eyeing prey.

Shen Tu and the others wore sorrowful faces, realizing that this time they truly faced inevitable doom.

Yang Kai, however, burst out laughing. “Interesting—very interesting! It’s rare to run into so many experts at once. Really gets the blood boiling. Since that’s the case, I’ll cut loose and cause a proper commotion!"

Kuang Shizong frowned, uncertain what reserve Yang Kai yet held, that he could still be so arrogant with no trace of concern.

"Everyone, be careful!" Yang Kai sneered and suddenly thrust his hands forward, roaring, "Come out!"

With that, a titanic thing abruptly descended over Purple Star City. It was enormous, like a mountain; when it appeared it blocked the sunlight and cast everyone into shadow.

"What is that?" someone cried out.

"So huge—some kind of humanoid puppet?"

"What exactly is that thing?"

People stared at the massive object, their ability to think almost lost.

It was plainly a humanoid colossus standing a hundred zhang high, as if piled from stone and earth. Its body seemed hewn by axes, sharp and angular, giving an impression of extreme hardness.

No breath of life issued from it, yet an oppressive aura comparable to that of a Third Stage of the Void King Realm swept in all directions from its frame.

Every Void King Realm cultivator hovering in the air felt as if a mountain had been pressed upon them, unbearably heavy.

Those below the Void King Realm swayed and teetered; the weaker among them fell downward. Screams rent the air continuously.

The giant's eyes gleamed with a lifelike intelligence; the instant it appeared it plunged straight downward.

Its descent looked like a meteor falling from the heavens.

"Bad!" Kuang Shizong roared as he saw Yang Kai's huge Incarnation falling; just as he moved to intercept, the sky darkened once more.

With a clear, ringing birdcall, a massive fire bird with a long tail suddenly appeared, blotting out the sky.

The fire bird seemed formed from flames, with flashes of lightning within it, radiating great menace that made hearts palpitate. As it flapped, the temperature of the air rose sharply.

That was not all. Golden Blood Threads shot out in strands as beast roars rose one after another; an army of blood beasts appeared in the void.

Thunderflame Soaring Beast, Tail-Crested Snake, Zhugen Bird, Star-Emperor Turtle, Eight-Eyed Demon Toad, Thunder-Soul Purple-Sky Leopard……

In number they were countless. Except for the Steel-Flame Ghost Spider left behind by Yang Kai to guard the Nine Heavens Sacred Land on Tongxuan Continent, the rest of the blood beasts had mustered in force. Each radiated intense power fluctuations, none weaker than a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert. Nearly twenty blood beasts gathered together, and the towering torrent of blood light seemed to pierce the heavens and stab into the Starry Sky.
