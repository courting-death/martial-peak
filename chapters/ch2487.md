## Chapter 2487 — Old Swindler

Hearing Mo Xiaoqi say this, Yang Kai’s gaze also grew much more fervent. Even though he knew this was not a place to linger, his legs simply refused to move.

He had already gained plenty of benefits in this Shattered Star Sea, but upon hearing that these bones might be the remains of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, he couldn’t help but feel a bit of greed.

If even he was like this, there was no need to mention the other cultivators.

The spatial ring on the skeleton’s finger drew everyone's attention.

“All you trash, get lost!” A low shout suddenly erupted, and in the next instant, a long spear swept out, piercing through the void and blasting straight toward the densest part of the crowd.

The overwhelming spear intent enveloped a vast area, and all the cultivators who sensed it turned pale and quickly retreated.

Boom, boom, boom…

The long spear swept back and forth, instantly clearing out a wide space on one side of the black hole.

Most cultivators, seeing the situation was bad, had already run off early, but a few slower ones were caught by the spear, and before they could even scream, they exploded into a mist of blood.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened slightly. Looking over, he saw a man standing with a spear, exuding unmatched might and arrogance. This man’s figure was tall and imposing, and clear waves of Emperor Intent swirled around his body.

It’s that guy!

Yang Kai immediately recognized him as the spear-wielding youth in tight clothes he had encountered last time in the depths of the Origin Sea.

“Liang Qiu, what the hell is wrong with you?!”

“Screw your grandpa!”

“You dare kill my Junior Brother? I’ll fight you to the death!”

The cultivators who had been forced back began cursing at the youth in tight clothes. Some who recognized him even shouted his name, and others yelled about avenging their Junior Brother, but it was all just talk. No one actually dared to step forward.

But with an Emperor Realm cultivator standing right there, who would dare step forward? Wouldn’t that just be courting death?

Liang Qiu snorted, resting his spear on his shoulder, and said arrogantly, “What? You won’t submit? Anyone who won’t—come over here. I’ll beat you until you do.”

He swept his gaze around with overwhelming presence, and anyone who met his eyes quickly looked away, unable to withstand it. Liang Qiu spat disdainfully to the side and sneered, “A bunch of trash, daring to covet the treasures of a Great Emperor! You really don’t know your place. If you don’t want to die here, get lost while you still can.”

“Liang Qiu, don’t be too arrogant! Even if your Hundred Barbarian Mountain rules the Western Territory, do you really think you can act so wildly in the Shattered Star Sea? Do you think everyone in this world is afraid of you?”

A sharp shout came from somewhere in the crowd, drifting and indistinct. No one knew who was stirring up trouble in the dark. But this person was clearly wary of Liang Qiu and the power behind Hundred Barbarian Mountain, so they didn’t dare rebuke him openly, lest Liang Qiu settle accounts later.

Liang Qiu let out a cold chuckle. “The Shattered Star Sea has gathered heroes from every corner. My Hundred Barbarian Mountain alone could never stand against the entire Star Realm. But…” He raised his brows and snorted, “What if I add these friends to my side?”

As soon as he finished speaking, seven or eight people stepped out from all directions and gathered at Liang Qiu’s side.

“Hiss…” A wave of gasps sounded. Everyone couldn’t help but take a few steps back, faces full of shock.

Because these seven or eight people who stepped out were all Emperors, each with a deep and powerful aura—not people to be trifled with.

Yang Kai frowned slightly and swept his gaze over them, finding that he recognized most of these Emperor Realm cultivators.

Among them were Red Ghost, Yao Si, Wuchang, and that fat man he’d seen before in the Origin Sea. The rest, though Yang Kai didn’t know them, were clearly elite disciples from the major Sects of the Star Realm who had gained opportunities in the Shattered Star Sea and advanced to the Emperor Realm.

With these people gathered together, their numbers weren’t large, but their deterrent force was immense—because they were Emperors!

“You… you’re just bullying the weak!” someone shouted angrily.

“That’s right! Treasures belong to those fated. What right do you have to drive us away?”

“We’re not leaving! If you have the guts, kill us all!”

“Don’t be afraid of them! There are only a few of them, but we have thousands!”

“As cultivators, we should forge ahead bravely and never shrink back!”

Shouts rang out one after another. Clearly, these cultivators were unwilling to leave just like that. Even facing seven or eight Emperors, they wanted to stay and see if they could get the spatial ring from the skeleton.

If someone really managed to get that spatial ring, they might turn their life around in an instant and soar to the heavens. Such an opportunity was rare and definitely worth risking everything for.

“If you won’t leave, then die!” Yao Si suddenly said coldly. With a wave of his hand, black qi surged over his body, accompanied by terrifying wails. Strands of black qi shot out from his body like living things.

As soon as the black qi left his body, it transformed into fierce, ghostly figures with twisted faces, clawing and biting at the surrounding cultivators.

But the many cultivators here were no weaklings. To enter the Shattered Star Sea, one had to be at least at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and after nearly three years of tempering, everyone had made great progress.

So when Yao Si made his move, no one was willing to sit and wait for death—they all fought back.

In an instant, the light of Secret Treasures and secret techniques flared everywhere.

But strangely, all their attacks had little effect on those ghostly figures. Only a few people with astonishing strength and deep foundations managed to block the black qi. The rest, as soon as they were touched, had the black qi invade their bodies. In the blink of an eye, they went mad, eyes bulging as if they’d seen something terrifying, screaming wildly.

In no time at all, these screaming cultivators all fell backward, blood streaming from their seven orifices, their lives snuffed out.

With just one move, Yao Si took the lives of over a hundred people. And judging by his demeanor, this was just a small demonstration—he hadn’t even used much of his strength.

Everyone was horrified.

If it were someone else, they might still dare to curse and incite others to fight back. But who was Yao Si? He was the son of Great Emperor Youhun. To curse him to his face was to curse Great Emperor Youhun—who would dare? Let alone fight back.

In an instant, all the cultivators retreated in terror.

Over there, Liang Qiu snorted, “I gave you a chance to leave, but you insisted on suffering. What a bunch of wretches!”

The cultivators who were scolded looked ugly, anger surging in their hearts, but they didn’t dare say a word in retort.

With Yao Si’s move, everyone retreated dozens of zhang, leaving only a few people still around the black hole.

Red Ghost, with his wild, fiery red hair, grinned and said, “There are still some fools left. Guess they won’t cry until they see the coffin, huh?”

Liang Qiu snorted, “If you stayed, you must think you’re capable. Since you’re so capable, if I kill you, you can’t blame anyone else.”

As he spoke, his hawk-like eyes swept around, looking for someone to make an example of.

After a while, he was a bit surprised. “Damn, they really are all capable people.”

He was annoyed to find that those who stayed were basically all Emperors, or had Emperor Realm protectors. Though he was strong, he didn’t want to clash with Emperors lightly. After all, his own realm was still unstable—if he got injured, his cultivation might fall.

Yang Kai also took the opportunity to glance around, and soon his eyes lit up as he looked in one direction.

Because over there, he actually saw Xia Sheng from the Qingyang Shrine!

Over a month ago, when he came to the Origin Sea, he’d met Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao, and from them learned that Xia Sheng was advancing to the Emperor Realm, though he didn’t know where.

Now, he actually saw him here, and Xia Sheng’s aura was bold and intense—he had clearly broken through to the Emperor Realm.

Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao were standing right beside Xia Sheng.

When there were more people earlier, Yang Kai hadn’t noticed them. Now that most had retreated, Xia Sheng and the others stood out.

Sensing Yang Kai’s gaze, Xia Sheng and the other two looked over as well. Their eyes met, and Xia Sheng grinned, showing a mouthful of white teeth.

Murong Xiaoxiao and Xiao Baiyi also nodded slightly to Yang Kai, but in this situation, no one could greet each other openly.

On the Southern Territory’s side, among the remaining cultivators besides the three from Qingyang Shrine, there were also Xiao Chen and Princess Lan Xun.

Xiao Chen was now also an Emperor, and Princess Lan Xun’s status was extraordinary. The two of them weren’t afraid of Yao Si’s group at all.

But Yang Kai didn’t see Zhuang Bufan from the Wuhua Hall or Luo Yuan from the Eight Directions Sect!

These two were both top elites of the Southern Territory. Previously, in the Four Seasons Land, they’d performed exceptionally. Who knows why they didn’t come to the Origin Sea this time. But with their talent, even if they didn’t come, their future achievements wouldn’t be low—especially Luo Yuan's. Eight Directions Sect was an obscure little sect in the Southern Territory, even less renowned than Chiyue Sect. But Luo Yuan had heaven-defying talent. Back in the Four Seasons Land, he could fight Wuchang to a draw.

Now Wuchang was already an Emperor, so Luo Yuan probably wasn’t far behind.

There weren’t many others left—some were alone, some in small groups. Altogether, only a dozen or so. Besides those from the Southern Territory, Yang Kai didn’t recognize the rest. He also didn’t see Zi Yu from the Ice Heart Valley in the Northern Territory, or Lan He from the Heavenly Wolf Valley in the Eastern Territory.

“Eldest Brother Yang, Eldest Brother Yang!” Just as Yang Kai was looking around, Mo Xiaoqi suddenly nudged him and whispered, “Look, that old swindler!”

“What?” Yang Kai was startled. Following her finger, he looked over, and in the next moment, his eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at someone, stunned. “Am I seeing things?”

As he spoke, he rubbed his eyes hard.

“Eldest Brother Yang, you haven’t forgotten that old swindler, have you?” Mo Xiaoqi asked in a low voice, seeing his strange reaction.

“Of course I remember!” Yang Kai quickly nodded, a little dazed. “It’s just… how could he be here!”
