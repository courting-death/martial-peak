## Chapter 2576 — Reunion

This was not an exaggeration. The Stone Spirit Race was born with mastery over the Laws of Earth; moving mountains and overturning seas is nothing out of the ordinary for them.

Yang Kai turned to the Stone Giant and said, “If he lets you go, can you not hold a grudge against him?”

The Stone Giant snorted, "Anyone who dares to scheme against my Stone Spirit Race is an enemy!" His attitude showed he had no intention of letting things go, leaving Yang Kai speechless.

"Young Master Yang, look!" Xie Wuwei pointed at the Stone Giant, meaning it wasn’t that he didn’t want to let him go, but the other party refused to let things rest, so there was nothing he could do.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, feeling helpless as he looked at the Stone Giant. He said, "The Yao King is quite powerful. If you fight again, it’ll only end in mutual harm. As the saying goes, it’s better to resolve enmity than to create it. Why not let it go? You haven’t lost anything, so let bygones be bygones."

The Stone Giant grunted twice, still looking very unwilling.

Xie Wuwei also flung his sleeve, clearly unhappy.

Yang Kai looked earnestly at the Stone Giant and said, “Didn’t you say I’m an honored guest of your race? How about giving me some face and letting this go?”

The Stone Giant grumbled for a while, finally saying with clear reluctance, "Fine, let’s leave it at that."

This meant he was willing to let the matter drop.

Yang Kai immediately signaled to Xie Wuwei, "Release him!"

Although Xie Wuwei was still somewhat unwilling, he couldn’t go against Yang Kai. He urged his Yao Yuan, and in an instant, Yao Qi surged, rushing toward the dark chains binding the Stone Giant. No one knew what trick Xie Wuwei used, but with a few cracking sounds, the chains fell to the ground.

Seeing the Stone Giant freed, Xie Wuwei immediately darted behind Yang Kai, looking wary.

It wasn’t that he feared the Stone Giant, but this creature was truly hard to deal with. If he took a punch, he’d cough up three pints of blood. Unless forced, Xie Wuwei didn’t want to fight him.

The Stone Giant merely glanced sideways at Xie Wuwei, his eyes fierce, but he kept his word and didn’t do anything after being freed.

Yang Kai asked from the side, "Can you take me to see Xiaoxiao now?"

The Stone Giant nodded lightly. With a crackling sound, he shrank from five zhang tall to human height, becoming much more compact. He waved to Yang Kai and strode out, completely ignoring Xie Wuwei, acting as if no one else mattered.

Yang Kai hurried to follow.

Xie Wuwei felt uncomfortable, hesitated for a moment, then followed as well. The gathered yao looked puzzled, not understanding why the Yao King would obey a human’s command and release the Stone Giant they had worked so hard to capture.

Xie Wuwei naturally didn’t bother explaining, just walked upward with a grim face.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the group left the underground palace and returned to the surface.

The Stone Giant looked around to get his bearings, then stomped the ground and shot skyward, leaping several thousand zhang in an instant, plunging into the dense, ancient forest.

Seeing this, Yang Kai quickly said to Xie Wuwei, "Yao King, please pay close attention to the matter I entrusted to you. If you find that woman, it would be best to capture her safely. If not, have someone keep watch. I’ll return, but don’t harm her."

Xie Wuwei looked bitter but had to clasp his fists and say, "Rest assured, Young Master Yang. I won’t let you down. But you must be careful on your journey."

He actually wished Yang Kai would never return, but if Yang Kai encountered danger, as his soul slave, Xie Wuwei wouldn’t fare well either, so he naturally didn’t want Yang Kai to face any peril.

With no time for more words, Yang Kai nodded. Emperor Yuan wrapped around Zhang Ruoxi, and under the Laws of Space, they vanished, chasing after the Stone Giant.

The yao watched Yang Kai leave, then all stepped forward, looking at Xie Wuwei in confusion, not understanding what the Yao King was up to.

Xie Wuwei said grimly, "Not a word of today’s events must be leaked, or death awaits!"

The yao shuddered and all clasped their fists in agreement.

The Stone Giant couldn’t fly, but his jumping ability was astonishing. Each leap covered several thousand zhang, so his speed wasn’t slow.

He waited ahead for Yang Kai, and when Yang Kai caught up, the Stone Giant continued forward without looking back.

He was clearly very familiar with the Wild Ancient Land, winding through the terrain and avoiding the territories of powerful beings, causing little disturbance.

However, Yang Kai’s earlier request not to trouble Xie Wuwei seemed to annoy him, so he didn’t try to communicate with Yang Kai along the way. Yang Kai wanted to ask about the Stone Spirit Race and Xiaoxiao, but had no chance, so he just followed behind.

Ruoxi also noticed Yang Kai was preoccupied and stayed silent, not daring to disturb him.

The journey felt quite dull.

After traveling through the Ancient Land for a full day and night, the Stone Giant finally stopped. His human-sized stone body stood atop a giant treetop, facing the morning light and gazing into the distance.

Swish—

Yang Kai landed beside him, following his gaze. Deep in the forest, ancient trees towered, layer upon layer, shrouded in morning mist—a scene like a fairyland.

The Stone Giant clenched his hand into a fist and pounded it fiercely against his own chest, producing heavy thudding sounds that echoed through the air. The sight left Zhang Ruoxi pale and trembling, afraid that if he struck too hard, he might batter himself to death.

"Roar!" The Stone Giant howled at the sky, his voice filled with a strange emotion, rising and falling as if conveying a message through some mysterious means.

Crash—

Birds scattered, beasts fled.

Immediately, another resounding howl echoed from deep within the forest, responding to the Stone Giant’s call.

Yang Kai’s heart surged. Upon arriving here, he suddenly felt an invisible spiritual connection from somewhere in the forest, linking him instantly. It was a bloodline resonance, impossible to erase even after countless years.

Xiaoxiao!

Xiaoxiao was born from Yang Kai’s Essence-Blood. In other words, Yang Kai’s blood flows in Xiaoxiao’s body—a bond rooted in the bones, impossible for anyone or anything to sever.

“The Elder has agreed to let you enter our tribe’s territory. Follow me,” the Stone Giant suddenly said, turning his head. With that, he leapt down from the treetop and dashed through the forest, nimble as a monkey.

Yang Kai suppressed his excitement and followed.

A gray figure, only half the height of a man, darted through the forest, racing straight toward Yang Kai’s direction.

The distance between them closed rapidly. Even with thousands of trees in the way, they could sense each other clearly.

Whoosh—

Yang Kai paused abruptly, stopping in place.

Immediately, a flash of gray light shot toward him like lightning. Ruoxi was startled, thinking it was an ambush, and instantly summoned the Myriad Beasts Seal. But she soon realized she was mistaken.

Because at that moment, Yang Kai was actually smiling as he reached out a hand toward the incoming light.

The stream of light didn’t slow, crashing straight into Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s eyes nearly popped out as he was pushed back by a tremendous force, flying uncontrollably and smashing through several large trees before finally slowing down.

"Cough, cough…" He couldn’t catch his breath and almost suffered internal injuries.

Xiaoxiao’s hug was a bit violent.

Leaning against a half-tilted tree, Yang Kai reached out and patted Xiaoxiao, who was rubbing its head against him.

"Wuwu…" Xiaoxiao made a string of strange sounds. Though Yang Kai couldn’t understand, he could clearly feel its joy and excitement.

The excitement of this long-awaited reunion made it lose control, so it greeted Yang Kai with a wild collision.

Soon, Xiaoxiao seemed to realize it had done something wrong, quickly climbed up, half-knelt in front of Yang Kai, and nervously examined him, afraid he was hurt. It even patted the dust off Yang Kai’s clothes.

But its strength was a bit much.

"I’m fine!" Yang Kai cheerfully patted its head, carefully examining it. After so many years apart, Xiaoxiao hadn’t changed much, but Yang Kai could clearly sense its aura had grown stronger.

The Stone Giant who brought Yang Kai here was dumbfounded. For the Stone Spirit Race, Xiaoxiao’s hug was just a hug, but for a naturally frail human, it was not something anyone could withstand.

Yet this human was completely unscathed, smiling brightly. This human’s body… was quite strong.

"Wuwu…" Xiaoxiao kept whimpering. If Stone Spirits could cry, it would surely be in tears now. Its excitement was stuck in its chest, so it bounced around like a monkey, making everyone laugh.

Suddenly, it jumped aside, opened its arms, and hugged a giant tree. The tree had lived for countless years, requiring three people to encircle it, its crown towering into the clouds. In front of it, Xiaoxiao being only half the height of a man was as insignificant as an ant.

Yet with that hug, the whole tree shook violently.

"Roar!" Xiaoxiao roared, and the earth hummed. Cracks like spider webs appeared at the tree’s roots, exposing the roots segment by segment.

Boom, boom, boom—

Xiaoxiao kept lowering and raising its arms, each movement making the tree shake. After a few tries, the giant tree was uprooted, dirt flying everywhere.

Ruoxi was dumbfounded by the scene.

She finally understood what true, boundless strength meant.

The uprooted tree was as light as nothing in Xiaoxiao’s hands. It threw it into the sky, turning it into a tiny black dot, with no telling where it would land.

"Roar…" Xiaoxiao howled at the sky, its roar unending, fists pounding its chest like war drums.
