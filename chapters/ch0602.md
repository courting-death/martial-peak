## Chapter 602 — A Very Familiar Scent

Shan Qingluo’s current condition was not poisoning in the ordinary sense, but a problem of a peculiar constitution; Wan Yao Ling Milk would certainly have no effect.

After pondering, Yang Kai could only leave Fenghuan Tower.

He went to check on Shan Qingluo; her vital signs were not too bad, but Yang Kai’s True Yuan had sealed her, so she could not awaken for the time being. Her delicate body burned like a hot iron; if this continued, it would not take long before the Enchantress Queen died.

Even her being of the Transcendent Realm could not avert such a fate.

He ordered Yunli to tend her carefully, then set out to find Biluo, hoping to learn more from her.

Shan Qingluo’s palace was not large, but not small either; after asking the palace maids for Biluo’s whereabouts, Yang Kai strolled off.

Standing before the door he knocked gently; there was no movement within. He released his Divine Sense to probe and found Biluo indeed inside, her breath even — she must be sleeping.

After waiting a while, Yang Kai pushed the door open and stepped in.

At a glance Yang Kai could not help but let out an amused, hushed laugh.

Biluo lay sprawled on the bed, motionless, covered by a thin quilt that emphasized every exquisite curve of her body; her hips arched high in a bewitching way that stirred the imagination — whether by nature or from the bruises Yang Kai had dealt her along the way, no one could tell.

From the exposed shoulder one could tell she was not wearing any clothes at this moment.

Yang Kai’s expression remained calm as he walked to the bedside and took a chair.

Perhaps sensing someone approaching, Biluo slowly opened her eyes. When she saw Yang Kai’s face she panicked, hastily clutching the quilt to herself, putting on the frightened look as if afraid he might be overcome by lust.

“What are you doing?” Biluo asked coldly.

“Your Lady told you about her and me, didn’t he?” Yang Kai asked.

Biluo gave a small nod; seeing no ill intent on Yang Kai’s face, she relaxed somewhat.

“Since you know our matter, you must also know how domineering and treacherous the Poison Widow Lineage can be.”

“So what?” Biluo rested her hands on her chin in a comfortable pose and said mournfully, “I can’t shoulder things for my Lady. As for you… hmph, if you have the heart, you might as well grant my Lady her wish.”

“Want to get slapped again?” Yang Kai’s cold eyes flicked down toward her buttocks.

Biluo ground her teeth in anger; intimidated by Yang Kai’s imposing aura, she kept quiet despite her grievance, unwilling to provoke him further.

“If I grant her wish, I will die,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “You know how dangerous Shan Qingluo becomes when she falls in love; if I sleep with her, I will be killed by the poison contained in her affection — I’m no fool.”

“You’re not the fool, my Lady is the fool.” Biluo suddenly raised her voice. “She would willingly let herself be devoured by her love to die for you! If you hadn’t had a whim to come back and check on her this time, then… then—”

Saying that, she began to sob softly.

Had Yang Kai not returned, Shan Qingluo surely would not have held on until he finished matters in Zhongdu and came back.

“That she would sacrifice so much — to be honest, I am moved,” Yang Kai inhaled lightly. “The Poison Widow Lineage, seeming ruthless, are actually more love-struck than any other women.”

Those words seemed to touch Biluo; she stared at Yang Kai for a long moment before wiping her eyes. “If my Lady hears you speak of her that way, she will be very happy.”

“I did not come to quarrel,” Yang Kai said. “You have always been at Shan Qingluo’s side — have you ever heard of any way to remove the love seed planted in her heart?”

Biluo shook her head slowly. “The love seed has already ripened; it cannot be removed. If my Lady is to remain safe, the only way… is for you and her to be joined in that way.”

Yang Kai laughed helplessly. “So the present situation is: either she dies or I die?”

Biluo bowed her head slightly and said plainly, “I hope you die.”

Yang Kai fell silent.

Biluo continued to sob, then suddenly, as if remembering something, her eyes brightened and she urgently said, “Right — my Lady once said the love seed itself cannot be removed now, but if the deadly poison that her affection contains when she becomes amorous could be purged, then even if you and my Lady… that, there would be no danger to your life.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, a glimmer of hope appearing. “Did she think of any good method?”

“That was only my Lady’s speculation; there was no concrete method,” Biluo’s expression dimmed again.

Yang Kai looked thoughtful, as if a crucial point had occurred to him though he could not fully see it through.

Biluo’s pretty eyes flickered as she fixed her gaze on Yang Kai, her mind mysterious as to what she was scheming.

After a long while Yang Kai suddenly rose, a broad joy flooding his face as he laughed heartily.

“What are you on about?” Biluo was startled and somewhat displeased.

“I think I have a lead,” he said.

“How so?” Biluo asked, surprised and eager.

“Shan Qingluo’s constitution was inherited from her mother. She told me once that an ancestor accidentally trespassed into the Spider Mother’s Nest and was struck by its venom, luckily not dying. From then on the Poison Widow Lineage emerged — each generation only producing a single daughter who inherits the Widow’s constitution. Since the Spider Mother’s venom is the root cause of this condition, perhaps that Demonic Beast knows something…”

The more he spoke, the more plausible it sounded. Yang Kai’s thoughts cleared; stroking his chin, he asked, “Biluo, where did that Spider Mother go? Is it dead?”

During the final battle at Zhongdu he was below ground, so he did not know the surface situation clearly.

“The Spider Mother should not be dead. That battle cost Cangyun Evil Land dearly; four of the Six Great Evil Kings fell, only my lord and the Lightning Shadow King escaped. When the bodies were counted, the Spider Mother was not among them — I think it must have fled.”

“Good that it fled!” Yang Kai rejoiced. “If we find it, there should be a way.”

“But do you know where it is?” Biluo asked.

“Of course I do,” Yang Kai replied confidently with a smile.

After all, he and Shan Qingluo had once fallen into the Spider Mother’s Nest; he naturally retained some memory of that place’s location.

“If so, we can gather the experts from my lord’s territory and send them to capture the Spider Mother for questioning.”

“No need — I’ll go alone; it will be quicker,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Biluo was astonished. “The Spider Mother possesses cultivation beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. Can you defeat it?”

“Wait for my good news!” Yang Kai chuckled and strode out.

“Wait for me — I’ll go with you—” Biluo called, but before she finished she cried out and fell back onto the bed; the fierce pain in her buttocks left her unsteady. By the time she crawled up, Yang Kai had already vanished.

Leaving Piaoxiang City, Yang Kai followed the remembered route toward the Spider Mother’s Nest.

Shan Qingluo had passed through the Thunder Beast King’s territory to reach that area; in his memory there was a lake nearby.

Now that four of Cangyun Evil Land’s great Evil Kings had died, the Lightning Shadow King had escaped but no one knew where he hid.

The Lightning Shadow King, fearing the combined forces from Zhongdu, naturally kept silent and hid his trace.

Moreover, since that battle the whole of Cangyun Evil Land had suffered grievous losses; Yang Kai traveled openly along the way and encountered no formidable experts.

Essentially, cultivators of the Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage were the top existences left in Cangyun Evil Land.

After Yang Bai wreaked havoc there, Cangyun Evil Land would likely not recover its Yuan Qi for decades.

Thus, even moving about so openly, no one dared trouble him; those who saw him from afar hurriedly avoided him.

Two or three days later Yang Kai finally reached the stretch of forest he had passed through; half a day later he found the cave where he and Shan Qingluo had stayed.

It was here that Yang Kai had once entered the Enchantress Queen’s Sea of Consciousness and planted the love seed in her heart.

Thinking back, Yang Kai sighed — he had then only been True Yuan Realm Third Stage.

Now he had reached the Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage.

His vast Divine Sense spread, covering a hundred li; Yang Kai sat in silence, sensing and searching.

Whenever a sensation of flowing water arose he would investigate to see if it was the lake he remembered passing.

After a day or two he finally found the right place.

Standing beside the lake where they had once stopped, Yang Kai smiled slightly; less than a few dozen li from this lake lay the Spider Mother’s Nest.

He leapt and sped off toward the spot he had marked.

An hour later a huge, canyon-like area came into view, the ground below full to the brim with countless spider eggs; white, exceedingly tough webs stretched along the canyon walls.

Here and there lay the bones of cultivators — no doubt victims who had unwittingly stumbled into this place and been devoured by the Demonic Beasts that dwelt within.

In the canyon roamed giant spiders the size of calves, bustling about. At the end of the canyon stood a huge spider statue of unknown age, remarkably well preserved.

Yang Kai hovered above the canyon, his gaze cold as he fixed on the depths and spread his Divine Sense, locking onto the interior of the spider statue.

Inside, he perceived a life aura that was no less than that of a Transcendent Realm master.

The Spider Mother! It had indeed returned and was still the lord of this place.

As Yang Kai’s Divine Sense detected the Spider Mother’s presence, a ringing, exceptionally pleasant laugh suddenly sounded within his mind: “Hehe… such a familiar scent, this scent… should be that brat from the Yang family of Zhongdu, right?”

Yang Kai snorted coldly and shouted, “Spider Mother, please come forth and meet me!”

“Since you’ve come, why not come down and speak?” That melodious voice seemed to carry an enchanting charm that tugged at one’s heart and urged obedience.

If one had never seen the Spider Mother’s true form and heard only that voice, one would certainly imagine her to be a peerless beauty.

Indeed, the Spider Mother’s face was exquisitely beautiful; that human visage was almost otherworldly, and any man seeing that lovely countenance would find his thoughts wandering.

But when that face was fused with its enormous body and eight limbs, the only feeling it inspired was horror, devoid of any beauty.
