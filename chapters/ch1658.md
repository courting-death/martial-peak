## Chapter 1658 — Return to Icebound Island

He met with his relatives and friends, feeling their concern and care.

Yang Kai felt warmth through body and spirit.

He suddenly realized that his painstaking return to the Tongxuan Continent to bring these people out had been an extraordinarily wise decision.

Green wood has roots, flowing water has a source; the people from the Tongxuan Continent are Yang Kai's roots, Yang Kai's source.

A tree without roots, water without a source, are doomed not to endure.

Within the Xuan Realm Pearl, to celebrate Su Yan's return, the three races—humans, yao, and demons—held a grand feast; the atmosphere was wildly festive.

Cups were raised and passed, goblets intermingled; regardless of cultivation level or age, everyone was swept up in it.

Yang Kai was forced to drink until he collapsed by the experts of the three clans, and when he woke up, his head was splitting with pain.

Afterwards, Yang Kai spent two days with his parents to fulfill filial duty, then hurriedly left the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Before leaving, Yang Kai taught Su Yan the Yao Transformation Technique.

Now that Su Yan possessed the Ice Phoenix's primordial power, she could also cultivate the Yao Transformation Technique to develop the primordial power within her body and strengthen herself.

The Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform was also left behind.

This treasure had been used to hold the Sun's True Essence; now it was of no use to Yang Kai, but for Su Yan it was an extremely powerful aid for cultivation.

With the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform, Su Yan's cultivation speed would increase by at least about thirty percent.

Having arranged everything, Yang Kai once more sped toward Ice Heart Valley.

Icebound Island lay in peace.

The disciples seemed to have recovered from the aftereffects of the recent earth-shattering battle; those who were to cultivate cultivated, those who were to seclude themselves did so, and days passed without incident.

On the outer isle, beneath an Ice Peak, a woman in a pure white dress was sweeping an Ice Path. Suddenly a gust of wind rushed past her; the female disciple could not help but shiver, and an inexplicable sense of dread rose in her heart.

She looked up with suspicion, scanned around, but discovered nothing.

She couldn't help but feel puzzled. After thinking for a moment she shook her head and continued sweeping the Ice Path.

At an Ice Peak not far from the woman, a figure appeared strangely.

He walked steadily and precisely toward an ice chamber; in no time he arrived before it. Looking at the sealing formation that blocked the entrance, he smiled faintly and tapped the void before him.

A ripple washed through, the barrier was broken, and he walked straight in.

Inside the ice chamber, Qing Ya was sitting cross-legged on the ground, resting her cheek in one hand as she stared wide-eyed at the Stone Puppet, the two of them locking gazes in silence.

She seemed very interested in the Stone Puppet.

On that day Yang Kai and Su Yan had, by earth-shattering means, slain two great Void King Realm opponents in succession; they immediately withdrew after the battle and had no time to take care of her. Qing Ya held no grievance; she vaguely suspected Yang Kai and Su Yan might have been injured, which was why they did not linger.

Moreover, though Yang Kai left, he left this peculiar Stone Puppet to guard her, so Qing Ya naturally bore no complaint.

She also knew Yang Kai and Su Yan would surely return to Ice Heart Valley to take her away.

In recent days, Qing Ya had stayed behind closed doors, looking out from the ice chamber in eager anticipation; when bored she would do as now—stare at the Stone Puppet.

She found that though the Stone Puppet had intelligence, it would not answer her no matter what she said, only sticking by her side without moving away.

"Little fellow, when do you think Yang Kai and Su Yan will come?" Qing Ya sighed; once she had taken pride in Ice Heart Valley, but after what had happened last time she could hardly wait to leave this place, to leave the Sect that had made her suffer and nearly die.

"Ah, you look so dull, why can't you say a word?" Qing Ya said, and flicked the Stone Puppet's forehead.

Her forefinger stung, but the Stone Puppet blinked its eyes with a puzzled expression.

Qing Ya was amused by its manner and couldn't help but giggle.

"In a good mood, are we?" a voice sounded.

Qing Ya's expression changed; her Saint Yuan reflexively stirred, but when she realized whose voice it was she turned aside with delight.

A young man stood there smiling, his grin bright as sunshine that drove away the cold and gloom of the ice chamber.

The Stone Puppet's two little black-bean eyes also shot out astonishing light; it scrambled over to the youth using hands and feet, thrusting out its thick five-fingered hand to point at itself and then at Qing Ya, as if wanting to say something but unable to.

"I know, you've done well guarding her; you deserve some praise!" The youth patted the Stone Puppet's head.

The Stone Puppet's little eyes narrowed, clearly pleased.

"Yang Kai!" Qing Ya whispered, and her face flushed.

It seemed he must have seen her earlier talking to herself, which embarrassed Qing Ya.

But quickly Qing Ya composed herself and asked with concern, "Are you all right?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "If there were any trouble, I wouldn't be here."

"That's good. Uh... where's Su Yan?" Qing Ya's expression changed; not seeing Su Yan, she instinctively feared something bad had happened.

"Su Yan is in a very safe place," Yang Kai signaled to calm her. "I'm here to take you away—are you ready?"

Qing Ya drew a deep breath, set her expression and nodded. "I've been ready for a long time."

"Then let's go!" Yang Kai tilted his head, suddenly furrowed his brow, rubbing his chin with a half-smile. "Hmm, we've been discovered, it seems."

At that moment, a cold, clear voice echoed through the ice chamber: "Since Young Hero Yang is here, why the haste? If you have time, why not come sit on Ice Jue Peak?"

"Grand Elder!" Qing Ya's complexion changed and she cried out; she recognized the voice as that of Luo Li, the Grand Elder of Ice Heart Valley.

Yang Kai gave her a reassuring look, then, gazing at a spot in the void with a subtle curve at his mouth, called out in a loud voice: "I cannot refuse Senior's kindness!"

"Then I shall await your arrival on Ice Jue Peak!" Luo Li's voice said, and the divine sense in the void vanished.

"Let's go!" Yang Kai beckoned to Qing Ya.

"Yang Kai..." Qing Ya's face was full of concern.

"Don't worry, she means no harm," Yang Kai smiled slightly.

Hearing this, Qing Ya finally relaxed completely and followed closely behind Yang Kai as they headed out.

At the entrance to the ice chamber, Qing Ya couldn't help but exclaim: she found that more than ten people were standing before it—from the Valley Lord down to the Great Elders—having somehow all gathered here, apparently waiting for Yang Kai.

At Yang Kai's appearance, everyone's expressions straightened and they received him solemnly.

Yang Kai's expression remained unchanged as he walked straight up to them.

"Young Master Yang..." Bing Long gave a slight nod to Yang Kai as a greeting; her form of address had changed, showing how greatly the earth-shattering battle had affected her.

"Senior Bing Long!" Yang Kai cupped his fist.

“I wouldn’t dare accept such respect,” Bing Long quickly waved her hand. “If Young Master Yang doesn’t mind, just call me Bing Long.”

It was evident Bing Long visibly relaxed; before coming she had feared Yang Kai would show a sour face or speak rudely and had prepared herself to endure humiliation—yet Yang Kai was gentle and affable, and she felt ashamed for having judged him wrongly.

She couldn't help feeling ashamed.

It seemed he truly bore no hostility towards Ice Heart Valley; a great burden fell from Bing Long's heart.

"Then I ask the Valley Lord to lead the way," Yang Kai nodded.

"This way, please!" Bing Long stepped aside, making way.

Yang Kai stepped forward.

In the crowd, Ran Yunting's expression shifted several times, and finally she couldn't contain herself and asked, "Su Yan? Where is she? What's her condition?"

Yang Kai stopped, turned his head, and gave Ran Yunting a faint look.

The hearts of more than ten elders immediately rose into their throats; even Bing Long's face turned tense as she repeatedly sent glances to Ran Yunting.

Ran Yunting feigned ignorance, met Yang Kai's gaze, and managed a bitter smile: "I have been an unfit master, but now I only wish to know whether Su Yan is safe."

"Very safe, you needn't worry!" Yang Kai replied calmly.

"As long as she's safe!" Ran Yunting breathed a sigh of relief.

"From now on, Su Yan shall have no ties with Ice Heart Valley." After saying this, Yang Kai continued forward.

Ran Yunting trembled; the bitterness on her face deepened. Most of the elders also sighed, slowly shook their heads, and wore gloomy expressions.

Ice Jue Peak was an Ice Peak at the very center of Icebound Island; it's not the tallest or most majestic, but it holds the densest Spiritual Qi, and Luo Li, the Grand Elder of Ice Heart Valley, cultivates in seclusion atop Ice Jue Peak.

It is rumored that on Ice Jue Peak there is the Eternal Cold Pool; the ice qi that overflows from the pool greatly enhances those who cultivate ice-based techniques.

The group arrived at the foot of Ice Jue Peak, and Bing Long and the others halted. "This is Ice Jue Peak; the Grand Elder awaits at the summit. Young Master Yang, please!"

Without the Grand Elder's summons, no one may rashly enter Ice Jue Peak; Bing Long and the others could only wait below.

Yang Kai nodded, turned to Qing Ya and said, "Wait here for me a moment."

"All right." Qing Ya nodded.

Only then did Yang Kai follow the flight of steps, each one carved from white jade, and walk upward.

As he walked, the biting wind cut through; the world was filled with an ice-cold profound intent that could freeze even space itself.

Yang Kai was not affected in the slightest; he strode on, with leisure to take in the surrounding scenery.

A quarter of an hour later, Yang Kai arrived at the summit.

Looking around, the summit was utterly exposed and extremely simple—there were no jade pavilions as imagined; in one spot stood a thatched hut covered in snow and drafty on all sides.

Luo Li, the Grand Elder of Ice Heart Valley, sat cross-legged in that thatched hut. Before her was a stone table with a teapot simmering on it, pale steam curling up; around the hut there seemed to be an energy that kept the biting wind at bay.

When Yang Kai arrived, the tea was just right.

Luo Li opened her eyes, looked at Yang Kai, smiled faintly and gestured: "Young Hero Yang, please sit!"

Yang Kai cupped his fist: "This Junior I will respectfully comply!"

Saying this, he walked into the thatched hut and sat cross-legged opposite Luo Li.
