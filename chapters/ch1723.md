## Chapter 1723 — Arranging the Array

Black Reef Island, at a certain location.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged with his eyes closed, quietly resting and restoring his spirit.

Faint footsteps came from not far away; Yang Kai opened his eyes and found that the Sea Hall's Third Hall Master, Qi Yunhai, had come over with a party of people.

The moment their gazes met, Qi Yunhai hurriedly lowered his head and looked straight ahead, bearing an expression of utmost respect.

Ever since that day when it became known that Yang Kai was in fact the Star Lord of Dark Star, Qi Yunhai no longer dared act presumptuously. Although his cultivation was on par with Yang Kai's, Yang Kai was shrouded in the resplendent aura of a Star Lord; even if a thousand of him combined their efforts, they would not stand a chance against Yang Kai.

He immediately repented his past mistakes and offered a full apology to Yang Kai.

Jiang Huai’an had already been crippled by Yang Kai, leaving the Hall Master seat vacant. Sha Hu did not like Qi Yunhai's cowardly, self‑preserving ways, but for the sake of the Sea Hall he did not press the matter further; he personally interceded on Qi Yunhai's behalf to Yang Kai and spared his life.

"Sect Master Yang, I have brought the people and the materials," Qi Yunhai said, stopping five zhang before Yang Kai and speaking with great deference.

Yang Kai glanced at the six people behind him, nodded slightly, and held out his hand. "Bring the materials here."

"Yes!" Qi Yunhai stepped forward and handed a spatial ring to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to sweep through it and confirmed the materials inside matched his requirements; only then did he nod. "Very well. You may leave. Tell Elder Sha that the spatial array will likely take seven or eight days to set up, so he needn't worry and should first attend to the Sea Hall's internal affairs."

With Jiang Huai’an crippled, unrest inside the Sea Hall was unavoidable. Although Sha Hu had no intention of grasping for power, only he could steady the situation at this time, so he would have to shoulder the burden.

"Thank you for your consideration, Sect Master Yang; I will relay your words."

"Mm."

Qi Yunhai left quickly, as if he dared not linger in Yang Kai's presence.

After he departed, Yang Kai looked at the six remaining martial artists. There were men and women, old and young. The elders appeared very advanced in years; the young looked barely seventeen or eighteen, in the prime of youth. Their cultivations were not high: the strongest was only of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and the weakest was merely at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

While Yang Kai sized them up, the six were likewise scrutinizing him, each eye shining with keen curiosity.

After all, the man before them was rumored to be the Star Lord of Dark Star, the great figure who controlled the cultivation star on which they lived.

Before bringing them, Qi Yunhai had specifically warned them never to go against Yang Kai's wishes; whatever Yang Kai said was final, and anyone who displeased him would be dealt with according to sect rules.

"You are the Sea Hall's finest formation masters?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

The eldest among them, a very old man, stepped forward and cupped his fists. "Sect Master Yang, the six of us are indeed those who have delved most deeply into the way of formations within the Sea Hall."

"Good," Yang Kai nodded lightly. "Qi Yunhai should have told you what was needed upon arriving here, yes?"

"The Third Hall Master said we were to assist Sect Master Yang in forging a spatial array to connect our Sea Hall and Lingxiao Sect, enabling material exchange between the two sects," the elder replied.

“Good. Since you already know, I won’t waste words. The materials have already been prepared by your Sea Hall — what remains is for you to refine and merge them, and to assemble the formation’s nodes and foundations. I trust these tasks shouldn’t be difficult for you.”

The elder seemed to realize Yang Kai was not the fierce, bloodthirsty figure he had imagined; Yang Kai's friendly manner relaxed him considerably and he declared proudly, "So long as there is a method to forge them, the six of us will not let Sect Master Yang down."

"Good!" Yang Kai smiled faintly, summoned the six to his side, and began instructing them—telling which materials paired with which, and what shape the finished products should take.

The six had profound attainments in the way of formations, far beyond Yang Kai's modest skill; after his brief explanations they understood immediately.

Yang Kai then took out the Sea Hall's prepared materials one by one, sorted them, and handed them to the six so they could refine the different components.

Laying out a spatial array was extremely complex, but Yang Kai had already set up a spatial array outside Lingxiao Sect before coming here; this was the second time, so he was somewhat familiar with the process.

The main work would naturally be done by him personally. He had only asked Qi Yunhai to bring the six along to assist and to save time.

He was also wary that these six might secretly pick something up. After all, the core formation diagram of the Space Array was still in his hands; as long as that diagram wasn’t leaked, even if they tried to imitate it and set up another one, it would be useless.

On this open ground of Black Reef Island, the seven each took up their duties.

In no more than five days, a spatial array occupying an area roughly ten zhang across was completely arranged.

At a glance, this spatial array differed from those found in the great cities: there was no circular archway, only a single round formation foundation laid on the ground, simple and plain.

But it occupied considerably more ground.

After all, once completed this spatial array could bridge a distance of millions to tens of millions of li, and in a single transfer accommodate fifty people simultaneously.

This was something the city arrays could not compare to.

With the array's rudiments in place, the remaining work required Yang Kai's personal touch. The Sea Hall's six formation masters did not hurry away; instead they stood quietly to one side, watching Yang Kai's movements closely.

But no matter how they investigated, they could discern no clues.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense drifted through the formation foundation, etching one mysterious and intricate pattern after another; these patterns gradually coalesced into the array's diagram.

His Divine Sense was Divine Sense Fire; it left imprints upon the already‑refined materials, and carving the diagram was an effortless task.

The entire process passed without any ripple; Yang Kai had finished carving the diagram in half an hour.

After a careful inspection to ensure there were no mistakes, Yang Kai smiled faintly, poured in Spatial Force to activate the spatial array, and simultaneously linked it to the spatial array at Lingxiao Sect.

"Is that it?" the very old man asked in disbelief.

"Almost. Once enough Saint Crystals are arranged in the array it will operate," Yang Kai replied with a nod.

The six all drew a cold breath and looked at Yang Kai with expressions of admiration.

A spatial array! To arrange such a vast array in just five days—if one were to tell this to others, no one would believe it.

On Dark Star the methods of composing spatial arrays had long been lost; what remained were relics from antiquity. Martial artists could only perform simple repairs; they could not rebuild an array from scratch.

Moreover, even when the method had not been lost in antiquity, it would never have taken so little time.

Records stated that composing a spatial array required vast manpower and resources and consumed enormous time.

After years of effort, managing to lay out a spatial array was already a remarkable achievement.

Yet here it had been completed in five days!

The six exchanged glances, each swelling with a proud elation—after all, their sweat and effort had gone into this array.

"Sect Master Yang, excuse my presumption—may I be the first to try?" the very old man asked, fingers rubbing together in excitement.

Being the first to use the spatial array might have no tangible benefit, but to him it was an honor.

"Wait a moment." Yang Kai chuckled, sat down, and took out some strange materials from the spatial ring, placing them before him to smelt.

Wrapped in Saint Yuan, the impurities within these materials were stripped away; the various substances gradually fused into a single mass like a mixed stew.

The six had no idea what Yang Kai intended, watching in a fog of confusion yet sensing profound mystery.

After a short while, a token‑shaped object appeared in Yang Kai's hand. It was unremarkable, black and without any Spiritual Qi fluctuations, but a single character was carved upon it: 'Ling.'

The strokes flowed like a dragon in flight, as if a divine dragon would pierce the firmament—imbued with a kind of ineffable, profound intent.

Yang Kai forged six such tokens and casually tossed them to the six.

Each person caught one and examined it closely in the palm of their hand.

The very old man, perhaps imagining something grand, became excited and stammered, "Sect Master Yang, may I ask what this is..."

He had clearly misunderstood, thinking Yang Kai had given them some precious item.

“This is a Teleportation Token. Without it, the only outcome of activating the Space Array would be banishment into the void, never to find your way back,” Yang Kai explained indifferently.

Their faces changed as they finally understood the purpose of the six tokens that Yang Kai had specially forged.

The very old man recovered from his disappointment and quickly grasped the key point. He cupped his fists and said, "Sect Master Yang is meticulous—I am impressed. This will prevent many martial artists from abusing the arrays to infiltrate the two sects."

The other five, hearing his words, were enlightened and finally understood why Yang Kai had forged the six tokens.

Although a spatial array connecting two places was convenient, it could be exploited by enemies to invade; Yang Kai's Teleportation Token could fundamentally prevent that.

Without a Teleportation Token, the spatial array could not be used at all.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, said no more, waved his hand, and Saint Yuan enveloped the six as they stood on the spatial array. “Let’s go—let’s test whether this formation actually works.”
