## Chapter 2109 — Discussion

"Shopkeeper Kang, when did I ever offend you?" Duan Yuanshan looked at Kang Siran with a bewildered expression.

Although he and Kang Siran had never been close, they had crossed paths many times. After all, Kang Siran was a member of the Ziyuan Commerce Guild, a person of considerable background. Even if his strength wasn't high, he was not someone Duan Yuanshan could simply ignore.

But ever since Kang Siran advanced to the Dao Origin Realm, Duan Yuanshan noticed his attitude had become much more dismissive, especially after hearing about Yang Kai's incident—his behavior grew even more hostile.

This left Duan Yuanshan both confused and secretly annoyed, feeling that Kang Siran had become arrogant and contemptuous the moment he gained power.

Now, being openly scorned by Kang Siran in front of Yang Kai, Duan Yuanshan naturally couldn't tolerate it. His words already carried a hint of anger.

"City Lord Duan, you must be joking. What virtue or ability do I have that could possibly offend you?" Kang Siran replied with a mocking tone.

"You..." Duan Yuanshan's expression darkened with anger.

He was, after all, a City Lord. Even if Kang Siran refused to show him respect, being ridiculed and taunted so openly was intolerable.

"Both of you, speak a little less." Yang Kai's mind turned, instantly understanding why Kang Siran had suddenly become so hostile toward Duan Yuanshan. Smiling at him, he said, "Given the situation at the time, City Lord Duan truly had no choice. His quick retreat was a helpless act; the fault does not lie with him."

"Brother Yang, you understand!" Duan Yuanshan snorted, his expression softening slightly.

"Is that so?" Kang Siran frowned, glanced at Yang Kai, then cupped his fists toward Duan Yuanshan and said, "Since Brother Yang says so, I'll offer my apologies to the City Lord. It was my recklessness—please don't take offense."

Duan Yuanshan's expression shifted, "Brother Kang, you're being too formal."

Though he said this, his heart was greatly shocked.

Kang Siran's change in attitude was all thanks to a single word from Yang Kai. Judging by his demeanor, Kang Siran seemed to be taking Yang Kai's lead.

Otherwise, as a Dao Origin Realm cultivator from the Ziyuan Commerce Guild, he had no need to humble himself and apologize.

These two... it seemed their relationship was not as simple as it appeared, Duan Yuanshan thought, unable to figure out what ability Yang Kai possessed to make Kang Siran—his equal in cultivation—so obedient.

"City Lord Duan, where is Zhuang Pan?" Yang Kai suddenly asked with a grim face.

If we're talking about the main culprit, it might not be Zhuang Pan, but he was definitely deeply involved. If that coward hadn't fled first out of fear, the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation wouldn't have collapsed so quickly. Given the situation, everyone could have held out for a while longer.

Qin Chaoyang wouldn't have been injured. Du Lishen wouldn't have died so tragically on the spot... As for whether Yang Kai would have been corrupted by Demonic Qi, that was uncertain.

Moreover, Yang Kai and Zhuang Pan already had some friction, so he naturally despised Zhuang Pan's cowardly actions.

"No idea where he is!" Duan Yuanshan replied with a somber face. "This was my failure to judge character. If I'd known Zhuang Pan was so cowardly, I would never have let him join the formation. He nearly doomed us all."

After a pause, he added, "After Zhuang Pan fled, he didn't return to Fenglin City. Given his cultivation, he was probably corrupted by Demonic Qi. But judging by what happened later, he should still be alive—just hiding somewhere."

"He'd better hope I never see him, or I'll make him regret ever being born." Kang Siran snorted coldly, murderous intent surging.

Duan Yuanshan gave him a strange look, then turned to Yang Kai, "By the way, Brother Yang, what exactly happened after that day?"

Hearing this, Mo Xiaoqi and Kang Siran also looked over eagerly, clearly curious.

Yang Kai gave a bitter smile, "I don't know either. At the time, I was corrupted by Demonic Qi, my Divine Sense in chaos, everything was darkness. When I finally woke up, it was all over."

He had long expected someone would ask about this, so he'd already prepared an answer.

As he spoke, he wondered aloud, "But I vaguely sensed several surges of incredible power at the time—though I'm not sure if it was real."

Duan Yuanshan continued, "Brother Yang's feeling was correct. It was Chen Wenhao from Tianwu Sacred Land and powerful experts from two other sects who arrived here. Outside the city, they seemed to have fought something fiercely."

"Oh?" Yang Kai showed a look of surprise. "Where are those three now? Did they say anything?"

Duan Yuanshan looked embarrassed, "They didn't come to Fenglin City. After that battle, they disappeared."

As the City Lord of Fenglin City, it was rather awkward to say this. Those people came to his territory but didn't meet him or say a word—clearly, they didn't regard him highly.

But as someone at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he naturally didn't dare criticize those Emperor Realm experts.

"So, those three drove away the Demonic Qi?" Yang Kai said solemnly. "They truly have heaven-defying abilities—accomplishing such feats and leaving without a word. It's admirable!"

Duan Yuanshan's expression grew serious, "Thanks to those three, Fenglin City's disaster was resolved. We really should thank them."

Even Kang Siran and Mo Xiaoqi nodded in agreement, clearly believing the disappearance of the Demonic Qi was entirely due to those three Emperor Realm experts, with no credit to anyone else.

Yang Kai was happy to let things be and naturally didn't reveal the truth.

"Yes, Brother Yang, I came here for two reasons: first, to check on you, and second... to ask if you'd be willing to stay in Fenglin City long-term?"

"Stay long-term?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

"That's right." Duan Yuanshan nodded. "As far as I know, Brother Yang doesn't belong to any sect or family. If you're willing to stay in Fenglin City, I'm prepared to offer you the position of Deputy City Lord. You know, Zhuang Pan was the Deputy City Lord, but he fled. Now there's a vacancy, and with your strength, you're more than qualified."

After speaking, Duan Yuanshan looked at Yang Kai expectantly, clearly hoping he'd accept.

"Well..." Yang Kai couldn't help but look troubled. When defending Fenglin City together, he'd already heard from Qin Chaoyang that Duan Yuanshan wanted him to become the third Deputy City Lord.

At the time, Yang Kai's answer was ambiguous. He hadn't expected Duan Yuanshan to come in person and ask directly.

"Brother Yang is no ordinary man. Sooner or later, he'll soar like a dragon. How could a small place like Fenglin City hold him?" Kang Siran suddenly spoke from the side.

Duan Yuanshan glanced at Kang Siran, then at Yang Kai, and said, "I understand."

Yang Kai gave a bitter smile, "Forgive me, City Lord. I'm used to wandering alone and never stay in one place for long. So I can only accept your kindness in spirit."

"No problem. Just getting an answer from you is enough to satisfy me!"

Mo Xiaoqi giggled from the side, "Eldest Brother Yang, if you ever want to leave Fenglin City, let me know. I'll go with you and travel the world."

Yang Kai glanced at her and teased, "Having a beauty by my side, how could I refuse?"

"Pfft..." Mo Xiaoqi's face instantly turned bright red, looking shy. "Eldest Brother Yang, you're so bad!"

Duan Yuanshan and Kang Siran both burst out laughing.

But when they looked at the large birthmark on Mo Xiaoqi's face, both couldn't help but sigh.

If not for that birthmark, Mo Xiaoqi would be an absolute beauty. Even with it, her beauty couldn't be hidden—though it did mar her overall appearance.

Afterwards, the three chatted for a while longer before Duan Yuanshan and the others got up to leave.

"By the way, Brother Yang..." Duan Yuanshan suddenly turned before leaving, "There's something I need to tell you."

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"That fellow you had imprisoned somehow vanished from the city jail."

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, "That old swindler?"

"Exactly!" Duan Yuanshan looked puzzled. "Even though all the city's martial artists were busy defending the city and no one was guarding the jail, you'd personally sealed his strength. With his cultivation, it should've been impossible to escape. But later, a jailer reported that he had disappeared without a trace—no clues left behind. It's truly strange!"

"Heh..." Yang Kai smiled faintly, "I understand."

Duan Yuanshan was stunned, "You expected this?"

Seeing Yang Kai so unsurprised, Duan Yuanshan couldn't help but realize.

"Just a guess, but it seems that old fellow is no ordinary person," Yang Kai said, twitching his mouth.

That old swindler came alone from Musen City, seeking help from Fenglin City. With only Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation, he could move freely through the endless Demonic Qi—clearly, he had some tricks.

And after Yang Kai placed a seal on him, he vanished from the jail without a sound.

How could an ordinary Void King Realm cultivator manage such a feat? Who knows what secrets he holds to possess such mysterious abilities!

"Do you need me to pursue him?" Duan Yuanshan asked, "If you do, I can help."

"No need," Yang Kai shook his head. "I was just curious and wanted to learn how he could move freely through Demonic Qi, hoping it might help the city's martial artists in the future. Now that the crisis is over, there's no need. He hasn't done anything truly evil—just likes to swindle money."

"If that's what you say, then I'll let him go." Duan Yuanshan laughed, cupped his fists, "Brother Yang, take care and rest for now. We'll take our leave."

Yang Kai nodded, watching the three leave before returning to his room to sit down.

Half an hour later, he opened his eyes again and said calmly, "Since you're here, come in. What's the point of sneaking around outside?"
