## Chapter 1764 — Want to Leave?

A Void King-Grade Secret Treasure possessed immense offensive power, and Xue Yue herself was no ordinary cultivator—her strength was considerable. Yet even her attack failed to annihilate all of the swooping Illusory Void Butterflies, which spoke volumes of how terrifyingly resilient those strange insects were.

As Xue Yue struck, Yang Kai also moved.

With a flick of Divine Sense, more than twenty Golden Blood Threads radiating a golden-red light appeared; amid a twisting transformation, they each took the form of blood beasts.

Thunderflame Flying Lizard, Tail-Crested Snake, Steel-Flame Ghost Spider, Zhugen Bird, Star-Emperor Turtle, Eight-Eyed Demon Toad, Thunder-Soul Purple-Sky Leopard… a great many, too numerous to list. The moment these blood beasts appeared, they scattered and clustered around Yang Kai and Xue Yue, forming a powerful protective ring. Then, under Yang Kai's Divine Sense control, they each used their own means to suddenly strike at the surrounding Illusory Void Butterflies.

The blood beasts inherited most of the abilities those demonic beasts had in life; although they required control and felt a bit stilted, in moments like this they were undoubtedly excellent helpers.

Once more than twenty blood beasts of various sizes were unleashed, they instantly formed an impregnable defense, and the pressure on Yang Kai and Xue Yue was greatly reduced.

The buzzing of the Illusory Void Butterflies' wings never ceased; they threw themselves forward without fear of death, as if they felt no dread of dying, only the instinct to kill living things.

The blood beasts, radiating strong Qi and blood fluctuations, became the best targets to draw the butterflies' attention.

Yang Kai and Xue Yue stood in the center, and for a time were entirely safe.

Seeing this, Xue Yue could not help but be elated; she quickly redoubled her efforts, continuously manipulating her Secret Treasure to slaughter the Illusory Void Butterflies.

Yang Kai likewise did not idle; the remaining dozens of Golden Blood Threads sprang forth, crisscrossing and cutting through the void, slicing butterfly after butterfly in two.

But as time passed he found the situation did not improve: the four Void King Realm experts were still fighting separately, surrounded by countless Illusory Void Butterflies. The ground was already piled thick with the corpses of butterflies.

His brow furrowed.

The scene made him realize it was impossible to kill every one of the Illusory Void Butterflies; if they kept fighting like this, everyone would likely be exhausted of strength and then only be at the mercy of the butterflies.

His more than twenty blood beasts were also badly damaged. Although they had all been manifested from Golden Blood Threads and were not living creatures, under the butterflies' ceaseless wearing the Qi and blood fluctuations they emitted grew ever weaker.

"Xue Yue, we have to get out of here," Yang Kai said softly at Xue Yue's side.

"But Uncle Ni…" Xue Yue hesitated and looked toward Ni Guang, yet she could not make out his figure; the place where he stood was wrapped in brilliant colors, and only faint, violent energy fluctuations could be perceived from within.

"Senior Ni's cultivation is supreme; you needn't worry about him. As long as we can escape, he should be fine," Yang Kai soothed.

"Can you be sure you'll get us out of here?" Xue Yue turned and asked.

Yang Kai answered in a low voice, "Whether I'm sure or not, we have to try to find out — it's better than sitting here and waiting to die."

Hearing him, Xue Yue finally nodded and ground her teeth, "All right, I'll go with you!"

She had received Ni Guang's prior instructions and had anticipated this situation, so she did not hesitate much.

"Then stay close," Yang Kai said solemnly; with a thought he had those more than twenty blood beasts launch a ferocious attack in one direction, and in an instant a gap was torn open in the heavy encirclement of Illusory Void Butterflies.

"Go!" Yang Kai shouted. He shifted his body, grabbed Xue Yue's arm, and burst through the gap.

The next moment, the more than twenty blood beasts twisted and reverted into golden-red Golden Blood Threads, being withdrawn back into his body.

Suddenly deprived of their target, the Illusory Void Butterflies seemed stunned for a moment, but soon beat their wings and gave chase in the direction Yang Kai and Xue Yue had fled.

At that moment Yang Kai had no time to think much; wrapped in Spatial Force, he sped forward at an astonishing pace.

With spatial power applied, his speed surged; Xue Yue was momentarily dumbfounded, for only now did she understand what true lightning swiftness meant.

But Yang Kai quickly frowned, because he discovered his Spatial Force was being greatly restricted in this Lost Realm.

This damned place was riddled with spatial fissures; space power was inherently unstable here, and the butterflies' wingbeats also interfered with the void, which made his use of Spatial Force somewhat obscure and not at all effortless.

The discovery soured his face, and what angered him more was that after they had broken out of the encirclement someone was pursuing them from behind.

That person turned out to be Xu Wei, the elder of the Abandoned Nest!

Xu Wei was likewise desperate, breathless and fleeing, chased by countless Illusory Void Butterflies; yet he paid them no heed, desperately pursuing Yang Kai and Xue Yue, and even when struck he offered no real counterattack, only clumsy evasion.

"What is he trying to do?" Xue Yue vaguely sensed trouble.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, "He's only trying to use us as a shield so he can run away himself!"

There is a saying: when being chased by an unbeatable enemy, don't try to outrun the enemy — just try to outrun your companions.

Although Yang Kai and Xue Yue were not Xu Wei's companions, he was clearly pursuing them with that very plan in mind: if he could use them to delay the butterflies he would have a chance to shake off those annoying ancient predators.

On the other side, Ni Guang had discovered Xu Wei's intention but had no way to stop him; he was at that moment unable to move, only watching Xu Wei's retreating back, eyes bloodshot and roaring in fury.

"Despicable and shameless!" Seeing through Xu Wei's intent, Xue Yue ground her teeth and cried out, her face fierce.

Yang Kai sneered, "People look out for themselves — if he tries to scheme against us, let's see whether he has the capability."

He remained calm and unflustered, not allowing Xu Wei's actions to throw him off his game.

In just over a dozen breaths, Yang Kai and Xue Yue had already leapt dozens of li; in the distance there was no sign of Ni Guang and the others, and behind them were only countless Illusory Void Butterflies and Xu Wei in pursuit.

Xu Wei was likewise being pursued by ever more Illusory Void Butterflies.

While fleeing, Yang Kai's Divine Sense drifted and probed the surrounding environment.

Soon he made a discovery and charged with Xue Yue in that direction.

In that direction there was a spatial fissure spanning the void, invisible to the naked eye; Yang Kai believed that even if Xu Wei unleashed Divine Sense he would be unable to detect it at that moment.

If Xu Wei followed their steps he might crash headlong into that fissure — even if he did not die, he would surely come off badly.

Yang Kai deliberately brushed past the fissure at extremely close range to confuse Xu Wei's judgment.

Yet to his astonishment, the countless Illusory Void Butterflies following them actually detected the fissure and circled around it, flying past on both sides.

The sight naturally entered Xu Wei's vision behind them.

Xu Wei had become a Void King Realm expert and was experienced and cautious; although he could not sense the fissure in the void, from the butterflies' movements he inferred there must be something strange.

So he simply followed the path the butterflies had taken and passed by the gap without harm.

Yang Kai nearly cursed aloud; he had never expected that in this situation the Illusory Void Butterflies would save Xu Wei's life.

As time passed, both the pursuing butterflies and Xu Wei drew ever closer, and the situation was once again approaching encirclement.

At that moment Xu Wei actually relaxed somewhat, because the butterflies that had been chasing him and Kong Fa had already been split into several groups, and there were not many still following him now.

With his methods, if he were to fight desperately he might be able to slaughter all the pursuing Illusory Void Butterflies.

But doing so would greatly deplete his strength and might even cause injury — an outcome he did not desire. In this Lost Realm he had to remain in as good a condition as possible to cope with whatever dangers might arise.

So he continued scheming to use Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

The two youngsters' speed surprised him slightly, but when he thought of Xue Yue's identity he was relieved. He believed that Yang Kai and Xue Yue's swiftness was all thanks to Xue Yue; this Hengluo Commerce Guild Young Master must have cultivated some extraordinary secret art.

Yet… that was as far as it went.

Staring at the two figures only a few li ahead of him, a sinister expression flashed across Xu Wei's eyes.

Immediately he secretly accelerated his own secret art, forming intricate hand seals.

The next moment a layer of crimson light burst from his body, as if a mist of blood had sprayed from his pores; at the instant the light appeared, Xu Wei's speed suddenly soared to an incredible degree.

A few li of distance were closed in an instant, and he directly overtook Yang Kai and Xue Yue, racing ahead of them.

But that wasn’t all—Xu Wei followed up with a backhanded palm strike, his vigorous Saint Yuan condensing into an attack that surged toward Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

That palm carried no killing intent — he had no wish to take their lives; he only wanted to delay them, for the dead could not slow the butterflies.

"Damn!" Xue Yue shouted. She flung her bracelet Secret Treasure forward to intercept Xu Wei's attack.

Boom — an energy explosion erupted; the bracelet was struck by the raging force and flashed wildly, and the ensuing violent impact sharply reduced Yang Kai and Xue Yue's speed, forcing them to steady themselves.

"Ha!" Xu Wei laughed arrogantly, looking back to mock them, "You two brats, try your best to stay alive!"

He wore the look of one who had succeeded in his scheme, arrogant and insolent.

"Want to leave?" Yang Kai's face turned cold; his gaze locked onto Xu Wei's eyes, his left eye suddenly turned golden, and in an instant a budding lotus pattern blossomed within his pupil!
