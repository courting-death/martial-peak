## Chapter 1520 — Ye Xijun's Plan

"But over the long years, the rumors of the Great Emperor have grown faint and vaporous; not only do outsiders doubt the very reality of the Great Emperor, even within Star Emperor Mountain there are dissenting voices. These people deny the Great Emperor's existence, seek to break the ancestral precepts, and aim to dominate Dark Star! A century ago I was betrayed by a treacherous man and finally had to leave Star Emperor Mountain to live in seclusion."

“So that person couldn’t stand being forgotten and schemed to seize power, is that it?” Yang Kai sneered. Though Ye Xijun hadn’t spoken too plainly, Yang Kai wasn’t a fool—he quickly grasped the twists and turns behind it.

"Indeed, and judging from how the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect reacted this time, he has done quite well — he has secretly won over Qu Zheng and Fang Peng and set them to serve him. Who knows what he promised them!" Ye Xijun nodded slightly.

"Inevitable," Yang Kai frowned.

Come to think of it, the first time he heard the rumor of the Starry Sky Emperor he had been dismissive; after all, every place has tales and most are invented by idlers with no proof.

He had once assumed the Great Emperor was just such a legend, not truly real.

But later, as more events came to light and he understood things more thoroughly, he was forced to believe: the Great Emperor was indeed a real person, not merely a legend or fabrication, especially after Yang Yan's memories returned.

He was not alone; countless people across the Star Domain thought likewise.

Although Star Emperor Mountain is the remnant of the Taixuan Sect, over tens of thousands of years the founding purpose had long grown faint.

It possessed the strength to dominate Dark Star, yet it quietly developed and even faded into obscurity until its old leaders died; no one knew of its existence. For Ye Xijun this might not mean much, but for those with ambition it was torment.

However, Star Emperor Mountain's rules are strict — anyone who violates the ancestral precepts is to be killed without mercy.

To break those precepts, one must seize supreme power.

Eventually the day came when Ye Xijun was driven away.

"I recall you were poisoned a few years ago; it was Ge Qi who carried the Star Emperor Token to Tianyun City to seek the Poison Pill…" Yang Kai said thoughtfully as he looked at Ye Xijun.

"Yes, it was that man's doing," Ye Xijun nodded. "His position was never legitimate, so every day I lived he fretted. He spent a century tracking down my seclusion and secretly poisoned me; that was no small feat. Thankfully the Sect Master had potent medicines, otherwise even if I had not died my cultivation would have greatly fallen. Now that I go, I intend to settle this score with him."

“Repaying hatred with vengeance—that’s only right.” Yang Kai grinned.

Ye Xijun brushed a strand of hair behind her ear and said slowly, "In truth, whether I occupy that position matters little; that man has already abandoned the ancestors of Star Emperor Mountain and betrayed the Great Emperor, which is intolerable. I will cleanse the house for the generations of my forebears."

Her eyes filled with killing intent as she spoke fiercely.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu shuddered at her words.

"Roughly how many experts does Star Emperor Mountain have?" Yang Kai asked.

Ye Xijun smiled lightly, "Star Emperor Mountain has always been small in numbers. Though it holds the best ground on Dark Star, across generations its total number never exceeded three hundred. When I governed Star Emperor Mountain it had even fewer — only around two hundred. It should be about that number now."

"Two hundred!" Yang Kai and Qian Tong gaped; such a small number was truly surprising. Everyone knew Star Emperor Mountain was not populous, but nobody expected it to be so few.

Could such a force still sit atop the power pyramid of Dark Star?

"Do not underestimate these two hundred," Ye Xijun warned. "At least eighty percent of them are of the Origin Returning Realm, and perhaps fifty are Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Moreover, Star Emperor Mountain possesses several Void King-Grade Secret Treasures, and even an Imperial Treasure! Their combat power must not be belittled."

"An Imperial Treasure…" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. "Do you mean that Extinction Thunder Bead?"

"Indeed. The Extinction Thunder Bead is one of them, but though its power is great, the Sect Master has already taken a strike from it before, so facing it again should not be impossible. If we can avoid taking a hit, Imperial Treasures lose much of their value."

"Yes — if the wielder is not strong enough, Imperial Treasures cannot exert much effect," Yang Kai sighed.

Last time they suffered because they did not fully understand the Extinction Thunder Bead; had they known, they would not have been nearly defeated. Now, if faced with it again, he believed he could handle it calmly.

Yet although he himself felt confident, he worried whether the warship could withstand a strike from the Extinction Thunder Bead.

"Besides the Extinction Thunder Bead, be wary of the other two Void King-Grade Secret Treasures. Star Emperor Mountain originally had three Void King-Grade Secret Treasures, though I took the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp out years ago, leaving two…"

For a single force to control three Void King-Grade Secret Treasures was unheard of on Dark Star. Even the Leitai Sect and Battle Sky Alliance only had one, reserved as an Ancestral Treasure and not lightly used.

However, the Void King-Grade Secret Treasure that the Battle Sky Alliance possessed had been seized by Yang Kai and become his spoil.

Ye Xijun then described in detail the forms and powers of Star Emperor Mountain's two remaining Void King-Grade Secret Treasures, warning Yang Kai to be careful.

Yang Kai listened with utmost attention.

Overall, Star Emperor Mountain's strength surpassed that of the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect by more than a little. Though few in number, they had many high-end fighters; fifty alone reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and such a force could indeed dominate Dark Star and sweep aside any sect.

Seeing his concern, Ye Xijun smiled and said, "Sect Master need not worry too much. Although that man has controlled Star Emperor Mountain for a century, his style conflicts with Star Emperor Mountain's ideals and he may not command true loyalty. Besides, his position is illegitimate; even if he has recruited some followers over the years, I may still have supporters!"

Yang Kai's eyes brightened and he looked at her with renewed vigor.

"Back then in Star Emperor Mountain many benefited from me and likely would not move against me. For a hundred years they believed I was dead, hence they accepted that man's status. But now… I will not hide it from you, Sect Master — since the day I came out a few years ago some have contacted me secretly and urged my return to Star Emperor Mountain; I simply did not agree."

"There's even such a matter?" Yang Kai arched an eyebrow.

“At this point, there’s nothing left for me to hide,” Ye Xijun said with a faint smile. “Since childhood, my master instilled in me the belief that the Great Emperor stands above all. Now that I can serve by the Great Emperor’s side, there’s no need to return to Star Emperor Mountain for an empty title. But since Sect Master intends to act against Star Emperor Mountain, I will, of course, lend my humble strength.”

"That is very good," Yang Kai said warmly.

He had been contemplating whether to, as before, rely on the warship's might and simply raze Star Emperor Mountain, but he lacked confidence and was troubled. Hearing Ye Xijun's words brought unexpected joy.

"So I ask Sect Master to grant me a few days to go to Star Emperor Mountain and negotiate; not everyone there wishes to oppose you."

"It's your choice; we await good news," Yang Kai agreed at once.

"Very well, I will set out now and go ahead; Sect Master can come when ready!" Ye Xijun was decisive and, after making arrangements, immediately prepared to depart for Star Emperor Mountain.

Moments later a radiance shot out from the warship, blazing toward the direction of Star Emperor Mountain.

After Ye Xijun departed, the warship slowed its pace, drifting unhurriedly to the rear.

Since they would wait for Ye Xijun to finish her dealings, Yang Kai was in no hurry and settled into seclusion to cultivate.

He had much to handle now. The gains from the Imperial Garden had not been fully assimilated; whether it was the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy or insights into the Golden Blood Threads technique, both demanded much time and could not be achieved overnight.

Moreover, Yang Kai needed to take the Life Jade Nectar daily to accumulate pure Golden Blood within his body, hoping that one day he might replace all his blood with this Golden Blood.

The Undying Five Elements Sword also required cultivation.

One thing after another kept Yang Kai frantic; now with a bit of spare time he would not squander it.

Within the Fallen Emperor Mountains, having absorbed an immense amount of Pure Spirit Qi, his cultivation had already reached the peak of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—he could break through at any moment.

Yang Kai avoided breaking through too frequently for fear of destabilizing his foundation, so he suppressed himself and did not accumulate Saint Yuan, instead studying various secret techniques and drawing alchemical knowledge.

In this way, without advancing stages, he could still strengthen himself.

In a side chamber Yang Kai sat cross-legged, taking out five Five-Element Treasures, including the Sun's True Essence, arranging a spirit formation to absorb their pure energies to temper his body and cultivate the Undying Five Elements Sword qi, while in his Sea of Consciousness he manifested a Spirit Body to study the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

He found multitasking not troublesome but extremely efficient.

Time flowed slowly — it felt like several dozen days, and yet also like an instant.

Just as Yang Kai was immersed in cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword and contemplating the Dao of Alchemy, he suddenly sensed someone summoning him by Divine Sense.

Startled, he swiftly withdrew his spirit, gathered the Five-Element treasures, and left the side chamber.

In a main hall of the warship, many powerful figures were gathered.

Ye Xijun returned, but the atmosphere was somewhat strange. In the hall, in addition to Qian Tong and others, there were several unfamiliar faces.

One was a beautiful woman with a solemn expression, dignified and graceful. To her left stood a middle-aged scholar, gentle and refined in appearance, while on her other side was an elderly man—thin and wiry, yet bright-eyed and full of spirit.

All three were top experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and the Saint Yuan fluctuations emanating from them suggested they were stronger than ordinary Origin Returning cultivators.

Even Qian Tong could not help displaying a wary expression as he looked on.
