## Chapter 218 — Crossing the Lake on Floating Duckweed (Part One)

“Since this kid has no objections, Brother Zhuo, please go ahead!” Ling Taixu beckoned to Zhuo Wen.

Zhuo Wen couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief, cupping his fists with a smile, “Thank you, Brother Ling.”

“Brother Zhuo is being too polite.” Ling Taixu nodded lightly, “In fact, both of us should thank Brother Zhuo for helping us out!”

The presence of the three from the Yingyue Sect was only beneficial for Ling Taixu and Yang Kai. After all, they were merely two people occupying a spot, and with more forces arriving, there was no telling when they might encounter an unapproachable existence that could take over this place.

With Zhuo Wen's addition, the situation changed. The two of them instantly became five, with two formidable experts guarding them. Even if someone wanted to make a move on this place, they would have to think twice about their own capabilities.

Zhuo Wen sensed the underlying meaning in Ling Taixu's words and felt at ease. He laughed heartily and called his two disciples to sit cross-legged.

Although it was their first meeting, Ling Taixu and Zhuo Wen were both seasoned individuals. After exchanging a few pleasantries, they had already become quite familiar with each other.

Since Ling Taixu had made things convenient, Zhuo Wen was inclined to reciprocate and revealed quite a bit of information about the other realm.

Ling Taixu happened to be in need of such information. Having arrived fifty years ago, he was curious about any changes that might have occurred in the other realm over the decades, so he quickly inquired.

Zhuo Wen was also forthcoming with his knowledge.

Yang Kai listened attentively from the side.

Through their conversation, Yang Kai learned that this place had initially been discovered by a few martial artists who had come to the Ghostly Underworld Mountain by chance. As time passed, more and more people became aware of its existence.

However, overall, those who knew about this place treated it as a secret and did not widely publicize it. Therefore, even after several decades or a hundred years, although more people were aware of its existence, it was still not common knowledge.

This remained true even to this day.

With so many sects in the Great Han, the number was immense. Yet, the forces currently surrounding the lakeside were still less than one-tenth of the total. If it were to reach the level of being known to all, there would likely be bloodshed every decade.

“Originally, if things continued like this, there would be no need for everyone to fight over positions. However, since the opening of the other realm thirty years ago, more and more forces have become aware of this place's existence.” Zhuo Wen sighed.

“What kind of changes occurred?” Ling Taixu asked thoughtfully.

“Because during that time, some disciples who entered the other realm obtained tremendous treasures.” Zhuo Wen's voice lowered, his expression serious. He paused for a moment, building suspense before continuing, “Someone brought out a few drops of Liuyan Liquid.”

Ling Taixu's expression shifted slightly, “Is that the supreme treasure used for refining True Yuan?”

Zhuo Wen nodded, “Exactly!”

As soon as the name Liuyan Liquid was mentioned, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu's breaths quickened slightly, clearly aware of the value and rarity of this item. In contrast, Yang Kai's expression remained calm, showing no signs of change.

Zhuo Wen noticed Yang Kai's reaction and thought to himself that this kid might be somewhat ignorant; otherwise, how could he remain so unaffected?

Little did he know that although Yang Kai had not heard of the Liuyan Liquid's great name, Ling Taixu's words were enough to make him realize the preciousness of such a thing.

However... Yang Kai already possessed Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, sealed within his Proud Bone Golden Body. He only needed to absorb it when he advanced to the True Yuan Realm, which would assist him in transforming Yuan Qi into True Yuan. Thus, he was not overly concerned about the Liuyan Liquid.

Good things generally attracted countless people, and since he already had Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, there was no need to pay attention to the Liuyan Liquid.

Zhuo Wen lightly coughed and continued, “If it were just the Liuyan Liquid, it wouldn't be enough to drive people mad. However, during that opening of the other realm, not only did someone bring out the precious Liuyan Liquid, but someone also obtained the Soul Cleansing Dew!”

Ling Taixu's expression shifted again.

Yang Kai finally became curious, “What is the Soul Cleansing Dew used for?”

Zhuo Wen smiled slightly and explained carefully, “Liuyan Liquid helps martial artists refine their True Yuan, making it more pure, while the Soul Cleansing Dew can help open the Sea of Consciousness, which is essential for cultivating Divine Sense. If a True Yuan Realm cultivator wants to break through to the Divine Roaming Realm, having a drop of Soul Cleansing Dew would make opening the Sea of Consciousness a breeze, with no obstructions. For those above the Divine Roaming Realm, consuming the Soul Cleansing Dew would expand the Sea of Consciousness with just one drop, making their Divine Sense as resilient as years of hard training.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Ling Taixu remarked, “I see, no wonder so many people have come! Even many young ones at the Separation and Union Realm are willing to take risks.”

Fifty years ago, no one at the Separation and Union Realm would dare to enter. Ling Taixu initially thought the world had changed, that the younger generation had become bolder, but he did not expect this to be the reason.

For martial artists at the Separation and Union Realm, their training had two main tasks: one was to improve their realm, and the other was to prepare for the transformation of Yuan Qi into True Yuan. The Liuyan Liquid was naturally a great temptation for them.

Similarly, martial artists at the True Yuan Realm also had two tasks: one was to elevate their realm, and the other was to prepare for opening the Sea of Consciousness and cultivating Divine Sense. Whether it was Liuyan Liquid or Soul Cleansing Dew, they all desired it.

This was what led to so many people coming here.

Yang Kai's heart was now ablaze with excitement.

He didn't care much for the Liuyan Liquid, but the Soul Cleansing Dew made his heart race. Di Mo had once mentioned that his Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus needed to absorb many rare treasures that nourish the soul to grow to a seven-colored level, and this Soul Cleansing Dew was clearly one of them, and a highly effective one at that.

If he could obtain some to consume, it would greatly benefit both the Warm Spirit Lotus and himself.

After discussing these matters, the two old fellows continued their conversation, while the three young ones felt rather bored. Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu were somewhat better off than Yang Kai, as they were from the same place and seemed to be a couple, their eyes filled with affection as they exchanged glances.

As if sensing Yang Kai's awkwardness, Chen Xueshu smiled at him and cupped his fists, “May I ask for your surname, Junior Brother?”

Yang Kai smiled back, “No need for formality, my surname is Yang!”

“Yang…” Chen Xueshu's eyelids twitched, clearly thinking of the Yang Family of Zhongdu, but he quickly dismissed the thought, not paying it much mind.

“Junior Brother Yang seems to be unfamiliar with this place.” Chen Xueshu sought to bridge the gap between them and naturally looked for a topic to discuss.

“Yeah, I was brought here in a daze.” Yang Kai nodded.

Shu Xiaoyu couldn't help but chuckle, “Your master is right beside you, be careful he punishes you.”

Chen Xueshu laughed as well, “If Junior Brother Yang doesn't mind, I can help clarify any doubts you may have.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai indeed had a question to ask.

“Why are these forces spaced several dozen zhang apart? Is there some special rule that led them to choose their positions?”

Chen Xueshu replied, “Ah, I happen to know a thing or two about this.”

With that, he stood up and walked to the lakeside, beckoning Yang Kai to follow, pointing below, “Junior Brother Yang, please take a look.”

Following his direction, Yang Kai was astonished to see a patch of emerald green duckweed by the lakeside. However, this patch of duckweed was not like ordinary duckweed; it was as large as a palm, lush and vibrant, with clearly defined veins.

“Wherever there is duckweed, that is where they choose to position themselves,” Chen Xueshu explained.

Yang Kai raised his eyes to observe and found that indeed, there was a patch of duckweed in front of each of those forces.

“Junior Brother Yang must not underestimate this patch of duckweed; it is the vessel that carries us to that other realm,” Chen Xueshu said. “Anyone wishing to enter must step onto this duckweed. Without it, no matter how strong one is, they cannot enter. Moreover, there is something strange about this lake; one cannot fly over the entire surface of the lake, and the duckweed does not support experts above the Divine Roaming Realm. Thus, the martial artists entering for training can only be at the True Yuan Realm at most.”

Yang Kai understood and nodded earnestly, becoming increasingly eager to ask questions. He learned quite a bit of detailed information from Chen Xueshu, while Shu Xiaoyu occasionally chimed in, making the atmosphere very harmonious.

As night fell, Zhuo Wen suddenly grew serious and said in a low voice, “It’s about to begin.”

As soon as his words fell, all the martial artists by the lakeside sprang into action. Suddenly, myriad rays of light surged from the lakebed, illuminating the entire lake with a dazzling brilliance, creating a stunning spectacle.

Immediately after, a strange and heavy aura descended. Even experts at the Divine Roaming Realm seemed unable to withstand this aura, each one appearing on high alert, their expressions grave as they circulated their energy to resist.

The duckweed by the lakeside began to spin rapidly, quickly growing to over a zhang in length before gradually coming to a halt.

Once the duckweed stabilized, Ling Taixu and Zhuo Wen both shouted, “Get on!”

Yang Kai and the two disciples from the Yingyue Sect did not hesitate at all and leaped onto the duckweed one after another.

No wonder Zhuo Wen had mentioned earlier that the duckweed could only carry four people; it was indeed the case. With three people standing on it, there was barely any space left, and adding another would fill it completely.

Zhuo Wen, with a serious expression, cautioned Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu to be careful inside and not to easily engage in conflicts. The two nodded repeatedly.

Ling Taixu similarly reminded Yang Kai, “If anyone provokes you, just kill them. Don’t be merciful, but don’t take the initiative to stir up trouble either.”

“Understood.” Yang Kai nodded.

“By the way, you don’t need to worry about those items in your cave; I will take good care of them for you. And that girl Su Yan, I will also keep an eye on her.”

Yang Kai's face flushed red. He hadn’t expected that his matters with Su Yan would not escape Ling Taixu's notice.

On the duckweed, Shu Xiaoyu shot a meaningful glance at Yang Kai, suppressing a smile.

After about a cup of tea's time, the duckweed beneath their feet suddenly began to move, resembling a ship sailing through the waves, steadily carrying the three towards the center of the lake, picking up speed.

Looking around, they saw duckweed all around, with people standing on it. Many martial artists were casting cold smiles, eyeing them with ill intent.

Yang Kai spotted several individuals from the Tianlang Kingdom. Regardless of gender, they all had fierce glints in their eyes, like beasts ready to pounce. Yang Kai also noticed the three from Ghost King Valley, with Jin Hao once again making a throat-cutting gesture towards him.

As the duckweed advanced, a massive whirlpool suddenly appeared in the lake. All those riding the duckweed were caught off guard and plunged into the whirlpool.

Screams echoed, quickly fading away. The surrounding scenery shifted, and when Yang Kai came to his senses, he found himself in an unfamiliar environment.
