## Chapter 677 — The Tree Longs for Calm, Yet the Wind Keeps Blowing

Upon a closer look, Yang Kai's expression shifted to one of bewilderment; he discovered that he seemed to know this person, for her life aura stirred a strangely familiar feeling within him.

With that thought, he walked to the dwelling where the person stood and pushed the door open.

The door gave a soft creak; the one who had been meditating inside was clearly startled, leapt to her feet and peered out warily. Once she made out Yang Kai's face, she cried out in surprise and suspicion, "How is it you?"

"We meet again," Yang Kai said with a smile.

He had not expected that the assistant Duan Hai had sent would turn out to be the woman he had encountered on the snowy mountain, Ji Meng.

Her golden robes could not conceal that proud figure: a flawless, graceful height, a chest swelling like rolling waves, long, straight, elegant legs. Her hair was tied into a ponytail at the back of her head, black and sleek, falling down to her waist and hips, lending her a youthful, radiant beauty.

At this moment Ji Meng looked at Yang Kai with astonishment on her face; she had not expected to see him again.

Suddenly her expression changed; she eyed the surroundings warily and urgently asked, "How are you here? This is not a place you can just walk into!"

"Huh?" Yang Kai said, taken aback.

Ji Meng said nothing further and rushed forward, grabbing Yang Kai's clothes. "You're not a disciple of our Divine Cult. This is where one of our Divine Cult's guest officials resides. You should leave at once—if he sees you, it won't be good."

"A guest official?" Yang Kai gave a curious smile. "What sort of guest official?"

From her manner it seemed she knew nothing of his arrival, only that a new guest official had taken up residence here.

"He appears to be a Spirit-Grade alchemist, someone with connections. Elder Duan told me to serve and attend to him." As she spoke, seeing Yang Kai still standing rooted to the spot, Ji Meng grew anxious and stamped her foot. "What are you still standing here for? Are you courting death?"

"It's not that serious, is it?" Yang Kai laughed, sounding more amused than before.

"Very serious! Trespassing into the quarters of one of our Divine Cult's guest officials—any Divine Cult disciple may slay you for that. What have those mountain guards been doing, letting you in?"

"Then why haven't you acted?"

"Why would I act against you? You're such a strange one. Go, leave now—before he returns. If he sees you, it'll be trouble."

Saying that, she hurriedly shoved Yang Kai toward the door, her face full of anxiety.

"You're so eager to get rid of me—are you afraid the guest will see and misunderstand? Is the guest a man?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and teased.

Ji Meng's face flushed; she retorted coquettishly, "What business is it of yours? You're far too nosy."

"Just asking." Yang Kai shrugged and chuckled. "I heard the attendants around your Leiguang Divine Cult's guest officials cater to every whim of those guests, and there's even a good chance they end up married. Aren't you afraid the guest might be some doddering old man?"

Ji Meng's body trembled. Fear flickered in her eyes as she shook her head. "No, Elder Duan said he isn't old, otherwise I wouldn't have come here. I don't know exactly what he's like, but he certainly isn't some old geezer. You're despicable to slander someone like that."

Yang Kai fixed his gaze on her and gave a slight nod.

"What do you mean by that?"

"Nothing."

"Are you going or not? Don't force me to act!" Ji Meng's expression soured; Yang Kai's antics were truly aggravating her, and her tone had grown impatient.

"Alright, I won't tease you anymore." Yang Kai shook his head slowly, no longer in the mood to toy with her. He reached into his belongings, took out the dark nameplate Duan Hai had given him before leaving, and held it out to Ji Meng. "You recognize this, don't you? Duan Hai didn't tell you much, did he?"

Ji Meng covered her mouth in astonishment and stared at Yang Kai. "The guest official nameplate?"

A complex light suddenly flashed across her eyes; incredulity filled her voice. "You wouldn't happen to be that new guest official, would you?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded, then drew the nameplate back into his possession.

Ji Meng stood frozen; she had been waiting here for two days and had been wondering what the new guest official would be like, how old he might be. She had never imagined it would be Yang Kai—he was far too young!

"Greetings, Guest Official!" Ji Meng's features twisted between embarrassment and resolve as she hastily performed a salute.

"No need to be so formal," Yang Kai waved, unused to the sudden shift to reverence after she realized his identity.

"I'm sorry, I didn't know you were the one Elder Duan mentioned... I thought you were an intruder. I truly didn't know." Ji Meng hurried to explain.

"No matter." Yang Kai smiled at her, then turned and walked inside.

Outside, Ji Meng opened her mouth as if to speak, then fell silent, her face full of chagrin and near tears. She had meant to leave a good impression on the new guest official but had instead made a mess of it and ruined their initial relationship.

Thinking of the private thoughts she had unwittingly revealed earlier, Ji Meng was filled with remorse; now she worried what he would think of her—he might regard her as a woman who would stop at nothing for gain.

Leiguang Divine Cult headquarters.

Inside one of the palatial residences, Duan Hai, who had only just settled in and had no time to rest, was interrupted by someone hurrying in.

Duan Hai looked up and laughed, greeting, "Junior Brother Xu!"

"Senior Brother Duan, what about the matter I mentioned before?" Xu Qi asked hurriedly, an obvious urgency in his tone.

Duan Hai smiled broadly. "Junior Brother Xu, you usually don't concern yourself with Divine Cult affairs; why are you so intent this time? But you have brought me good news. I have not failed your trust—I have invited that man over."

"Truly?" Xu Qi brightened at once.

"Of course. He arrived at our Divine Cult three days ago and now stays among the peaks reserved for guest officials. I have already sent a female disciple, outstanding both in looks and talent, to serve him. I believe he will soon be utterly enchanted." Duan Hai rose, walked over, poured a cup of tea for Xu Qi and praised him. "Junior Brother, this time I owe you. It is rare for our Divine Cult to win such a promising seed; in future he will be of great use. I will report this to the leader—your reward will not be forgotten."

Xu Qi's expression remained odd; he showed not a trace of joy at these words, which Duan Hai noticed. He could not help but ask, "What's wrong? Is there something else?"

"Senior Brother, to be frank, I had you personally go out and invite him here not because of his identity as an alchemist."

"Then for what reason?"

Xu Qi slightly released his Divine Sense and scanned the surroundings; after confirming no one else was nearby, he beckoned Duan Hai closer.

Seeing his solemn demeanor, Duan Hai grew serious as well, quickly realizing something was amiss and leaning in to listen.

"Because of the Coffin-Bearer!"

Duan Hai's body jolted; he stared at Xu Qi in astonishment.

After a long moment he lowered his voice and asked, "What do you mean? What connection does he have with the Coffin-Bearer?"

"I don't know. Senior Brother, you remember the last time I took people out and we accidentally witnessed the Coffin-Bearer's emergence, right?"

"Of course I remember."

"We tailed the Coffin-Bearer all the way to the Duao Alliance's Blazing Fire City. There he stopped. What followed, Senior Brother, you should have heard about."

"I've heard— the Coffin-Bearer captured a disciple of the Duao Alliance and then vanished."

"That person was not actually a disciple of the Duao Alliance. After inquiries we discovered his background was obscure, though he had some distant dealings with two of the Duao Alliance's female disciples. And the one captured by the Coffin-Bearer was the very guest official you invited!"

"What?" Duan Hai's face drastically changed. "Are you certain you saw him?"

Xu Qi shook his head. "To tell the truth, I thought I had misseen it. When I unexpectedly saw him in Giant Stone City that day, I could hardly believe my eyes. But I can be one hundred percent sure—he was the one taken by the Coffin-Bearer."

"How could such a thing be possible?"

Everyone believed that being seized by the Coffin-Bearer meant no return, yet Yang Kai had reappeared intact; naturally this stirred Xu Qi's concern.

"Senior Brother, you know what the Coffin-Bearer signifies. Legends say he guards a staggering treasure, a fortune sufficient to make any force into a colossus. If this man survived the Coffin-Bearer, he may know something—at the very least the Coffin-Bearer's hideout. He should be more knowledgeable than anyone. If our Divine Cult could seize that, we could clear out the nearby Tianxiao Sect, Rashomon Gate and Ancient Moon Sanctuary and dominate this region!"

"That's only a legend..." Duan Hai slowly shook his head.

"But it's worth a try."

"He's still a Lower-Level Spirit-Grade alchemist!"

"So formidable?" Xu Qi was stunned as well.

"Yes, and Elder Du in Giant Stone City spoke highly of him. Before I left, Elder Du told me not to take him lightly, saying his origins might be extraordinary."

"Elder Du appraised him so?" Xu Qi was shocked. "But according to the intelligence we gathered over a year ago, his background was unclear but seemed nothing remarkable."

"Unclear precisely makes it worth paying attention to!" Duan Hai inhaled deeply.

Xu Qi, cooled by the sudden revelation, quickly suppressed his earlier eagerness. Reflecting more on the reports they'd gathered on Yang Kai, he suddenly realized the matter was indeed riddled with doubts.

"What to do is for you to weigh, Senior Brother. Should we cultivate him to become a pillar of our Divine Cult, or should we gamble and seize the chance? Junior Brother will defer to your decision." Xu Qi no longer tried to persuade and handed the choice to Duan Hai.

A Spirit-Grade alchemist so young is an exceedingly rare talent; to have finally brought him here, it would be a loss for the Divine Cult to alienate him.

Duan Hai gave a slight nod and waved his hand.

Xu Qi slowly withdrew.

After Xu Qi left, Duan Hai closed his eyes and sank into thought, his expression conflicted and heavy.

The legendary name Coffin-Bearer had circulated across the continent for countless years, spawning endless rumors. Many strong figures believed there was a world-shattering secret tied to him; his Blood Coffin too was of great interest.

If that were not so, there would not have been so many Transcendent Realm experts trailing the Coffin-Bearer—these people all sought to catch a glimpse of its mystery.
