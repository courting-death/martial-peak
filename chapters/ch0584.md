## Chapter 584 — Collective Succession

Hearing the implication in Yang Yinghao’s words, the other seven men immediately fell into deep thought.

“Then we shall take our leave,” Yang Yinghao said as he stood up. The other seven rose from their seats as well, each casting a complicated glance at Yang Kai, all shaking their heads with a sigh before slowly walking out.

This meeting with Yang Kai had dealt them a heavy blow.

“Uncle,” Yang Kai suddenly called out, “how are my parents?”

“You needn’t worry about Fourth Brother and his wife. Even if the Yang Family were destroyed, I would not allow anything to happen to them.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly, and he said solemnly, “Thank you, Uncle.”

“We are family,” Yang Yinghao said softly, nodding.

The eight of them left the side hall and met Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen in the corridor. It was clear these two scions of the Eight Great Families were deliberately waiting there.

“Greetings to you, uncles,” Qiu Yimeng said with an elegant salute. Her upbringing in a great family was evident in her manner and etiquette.

In contrast, Huo Xingchen bore a careless expression that set Huo Zheng’s old eyes ablaze with anger.

Throughout Zhongdu, probably only Huo Xingchen seemed the least like a son of such a super force family.

“Come here, I have something to say,” Huo Zheng barked low at Huo Xingchen.

Huo Xingchen chuckled and obediently followed Huo Zheng to the side.

Qiu Shoucheng gazed at Qiu Yimeng with a heavy expression. After a long while, he finally said, “Meng’er, your vision reaches farther than mine.”

Before the Succession War began, Qiu Yimeng had vigorously advocated allying the Qiu Family with Yang Kai, while Qiu Shoucheng and Qiu Ziru had chosen Yang Shen, Sixth Brother of the Yang Family.

The facts proved Qiu Yimeng right.

During the Succession War, Yang Kai emerged as a dark horse, rising from nothing to dominate all.

In the later stages of the Succession War, Qiu Shoucheng issued orders recalling Qiu Yimeng and the Autumn Rain Hall to sever ties with Yang Kai.

But reality also showed that steadfastly standing with Yang Kai brought greater benefits than the united efforts of the Eight Great Families.

Now, Zhongdu was beset by troubles within and foes without. Qiu Yimeng remained at Yang Kai’s estate as his trusted right hand. Qiu Shoucheng not only could not oppose it but secretly felt glad.

Glad that Qiu Yimeng had chosen to unwaveringly follow Yang Kai, even at the cost of disobeying him.

His daughter was indeed more farsighted than he.

Qiu Shoucheng could not resist a sense of weariness in his old age.

“Father!” A gleam of clear tears sparkled in Qiu Yimeng’s beautiful eyes. It was the first time she had heard Qiu Shoucheng praise her so openly.

All her life, no matter how well she performed, Qiu Shoucheng never praised her, instead dedicating himself to grooming Qiu Ziru as the successor of the Qiu Family.

Sometimes, when Qiu Yimeng excelled too much, Qiu Shoucheng even showed a look of regret.

Regret that she was not a son.

But this time, he spoke his approval without reservation.

Qiu Yimeng felt a bittersweet pride swell within her.

“Father is old now. The Qiu Family will need you to shoulder more responsibilities,” Qiu Shoucheng sighed softly.

Tears welled in Qiu Yimeng’s eyes as she bit her lip, “Father, you’re still young.”

“No, I’m not,” Qiu Shoucheng chuckled and turned to the others. “They are all old.”

Kang Rui and Meng Xiping sneered sharply.

Elsewhere, Huo Zheng and Huo Xingchen whispered intimately. What they said was unclear, but after a long while Huo Zheng sighed heavily.

“Old sir,” Huo Xingchen said with a carefree air, putting an arm around Huo Zheng’s shoulder, “it’s time you stepped down and enjoyed some peace. Don’t run around on battlefields anymore. Find a few concubines and have me a younger brother! With so many sisters of mine, the dowry might soon become a burden on the Huo Family!”

“Bastard!” Huo Zheng struck Huo Xingchen angrily. “How dare you speak to me like that?”

Huo Xingchen rubbed his head unconcernedly, grinning, “I’m looking out for you. If you die on the battlefield, that would leave me the last scion of the Huo Family. You’re still vigorous now—I bet your prowess hasn’t slipped. Need me to teach you a few tricks?”

“Get lost, you unfilial son!” Huo Zheng raged.

Suddenly, Huo Xingchen dropped his playful demeanor and spoke seriously. “Old sir, perhaps I’m not suited to lead the Huo Family. But I trust Yang Kai. Think it over thoroughly—this will aid the future of the Huo Family.”

Huo Zheng looked at him grimly, snorting coldly, “Just you? You haven’t even seen through this situation yet. Who has been advising you?”

“Qiu Yimeng,” Huo Xingchen grinned.

“I knew it. That crafty girl is sharper than all of you.” Huo Zheng glanced at Qiu Yimeng, inwardly wondering how none of his many daughters could match her.

Qiu Shoucheng, that stubborn old man, had only one daughter, yet she was so clever she immediately grasped the crux of the matter.

Yang Kai refused to cooperate with the Zhongdu Eight Great Families because he did not want to relinquish the power he held. Naturally, the family heads of the Eight Great Families would not grovel before him.

If they did, the Eight Great Families would become a laughingstock. Moreover, the current family heads of the Eight Great Families had done unkind things to Yang Kai.

But if the family head changed, that would be another matter entirely. Especially since many of the younger generation in Zhongdu had some dealings or friendships with Yang Kai.

Like Huo Xingchen and Qiu Yimeng—if the Huo and Qiu families were controlled by the two of them, they could legitimately ally with Yang Kai.

Others, although having no direct connection with Yang Kai, were young and flexible; such complications were easily resolved.

What seemed like childish games had become the trend of the times, unless the Eight Great Families did not wish to leverage Yang Kai’s estate.

The family heads of the Eight Great Families left with heavy expressions, escorted by Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen to outside the estate.

All fell calm again.

Since Yang Kai’s sudden emergence, the Cangyun Evil Land forces had behaved with uncharacteristic caution. Naturally, the Eight Great Families would not actively seek conflict. Although Yang Kai wished to confront some enemies, opportunities had not arisen, so he focused steadily on cultivation alongside Su Yan.

Progress was slow but steady, promising great benefit in the future.

The various major forces allied under Yang Kai’s estate were content with the status quo. Though they came to aid Zhongdu, none wished to provoke the Cangyun Evil Land forces. Peace was naturally preferable.

Several days later, the family heads of the Eight Great Families again visited Yang Kai’s estate, bringing news that pleased him.

Qiu Shoucheng had transferred the family head position to his eldest daughter, Qiu Yimeng, ordering her to set out immediately for the Qiu Family’s temporary residence to prepare for the succession ceremony.

Likewise, Huo Zheng would pass the family head position to Huo Xingchen.

Meng Xiping to Meng Shanyi.

Liu Chuquan to Liu Qingyao.

Kang Rui to Kang Jian.

Gao Mo to Gao Rangxian.

Ye Kuangren to Ye Jingli.

All seven family head positions of the Seven Great Families changed hands.

Meng Shanyi and Liu Qingyao were old acquaintances of Yang Kai.

Kang Jian, Gao Rangxian, and Ye Jingli were unfamiliar to him but were likely top talents among their families’ younger generation.

Though chaos in Zhongdu had not yet ended and the Cangyun Evil Land looked hungrily northward, a family head succession was a major event for any of the Eight Great Families. They would not be careless, though grand ceremonies were impossible, so only modest arrangements were made.

This was a scene never recorded in previous annals—super powers collectively replacing their family heads, all of whom were young disciples.

Circumstances compelled the super families of Zhongdu to take this step.

Once these young successors took the family head positions, the great families of Zhongdu would all unite under Yang Kai’s banner, forming an unbreakable alliance.

“What about the Yang Family? Who will assume the family head position?” Yang Kai asked Yang Yinghao after hearing the seven others speak.

Yang Yinghao smiled slightly. “Who else but you do you think qualifies?”

The other seven nodded in strong agreement.

They had no choice but to pass the family head to the next generation in order to ally with Yang Kai’s estate. If Yang Kai refused to assume the Yang Family headship, their relationship would be less secure.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “I will not become head of the Yang Family. Uncle, I should have told you this at the start of the Succession War.”

“Are you serious?” Yang Yinghao was surprised. He had heard Yang Kai say this before—that his involvement in the Succession War was only to vindicate the sect, with no desire for the family head position. But Yang Yinghao had taken it as empty words. He never expected him to truly refuse.

With his current cultivation and power in hand, a mere nod from Yang Kai would settle the Yang Family’s leadership without opposition.

“I am serious.” Yang Kai’s expression was solemn. “Being family head takes too much effort. I’m not interested.”

“But the power you control now exceeds that of the Yang Family. You may not be family head, but you hold more influence than one.”

“When this crisis passes, those people will return where they came from. But being family head is a lifetime commitment. I’m not a fool to be bound by the Yang Family,” Yang Kai thought for a moment, then suggested, “Let Eldest Brother or Second Brother take the position. Especially Second Brother—I think he’d be glad to.”

“Yang Zhao is indeed willing and capable, but only if you’re not around.” Yang Yinghao shook his head. “Your brilliance overshadows him. As long as you exist, the Yang Family cannot be led by anyone else. Yang Zhao is simply unlucky.”

He could not help but pity his son.

If Yang Kai did not eclipse him, Yang Zhao would have been a fine family head, better even than Yang Wei, who was solitary and obsessed with cultivation—traits ill-suited for leadership.

“Don’t reject it hastily,” Yang Yinghao smiled gently. “Do you remember what I once told you?”

“What?”

“That being the head of the Yang Family isn’t without its benefits.”

The other seven turned their gaze to Yang Yinghao, appearing to know something, their faces displaying envy.

Yang Kai thought carefully and nodded. Yang Yinghao had indeed said as much.
