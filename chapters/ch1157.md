## Chapter 1157 — The Zhi Stone and the Three Forbidden Lands

Others simply assumed Yang Kai had money to burn and bought the oddity as a curiosity to collect. Only Wu Yi and Yang Flame knew that wasn’t the case—because while they waited for the Jubao Tower disciple to deliver the stone, Yang Kai’s expression was clearly one of excitement, mixed with an indescribable strangeness.

After a moment, a palace-attired woman from Jubao Tower brought the strange stone into Private Room C-13; Yang Kai handed over 150,000 Saint Crystals, happily toyed with the odd stone for a while, then slipped it into his Spatial Ring.

Yang Flame leaned over and asked softly, "Do you know what this is?"

"I don't," Yang Kai shook his head.

"You don't know and you still bought it?" Yang Flame rolled her eyes, a little speechless.

“I don’t know what it is,” Yang Kai said solemnly, “but I know it’s useful to me.” If he hadn’t been certain of that, he never would’ve bought it—one hundred fifty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals was no small sum, and even with his current wealth, he wasn’t the type to spend recklessly.

"Useful to you?" Yang Flame frowned, then suddenly blurted, "You have rare insects and exotic beasts?"

"Rare insects and exotic beasts?" Yang Kai looked at her in puzzlement, then, his mind stirring, asked in a low voice, "Do you know what this stone is used for?"

Yang Flame nodded slightly.

Yang Kai was astonished; that strange stone had baffled the many appraisal masters from Jubao Tower and even the experts present couldn't determine its provenance—how could Yang Flame be familiar with it at such a young age?

Besides, she was an Origin-Grade artificer and an array master; the girl radiated an air of mystery.

He had long suspected Yang Flame carried a story, and now it seemed that suspicion was justified.

"So what exactly is the stone?" Yang Kai asked softly. Wu Yi also tilted her head to listen.

"Zhi Stone!" Yang Flame spat the name out. "It does nothing for ordinary people; it can only be used to raise certain rare insects and exotic beasts. It's exceedingly rare and seldom seen; within it lies a peculiar energy that cannot be used to forge artifacts, nor can fighters absorb it. But if a rare insect or exotic beast makes its home on it, it will grow rapidly—so I asked if you had any such creatures."

Yang Kai suddenly understood. He now knew why, when that strange stone had appeared, the Soul-Devouring insects living on the Six-Colored Treasure Isle in his Sea of Consciousness had suddenly become agitated and excited.

Those Soul-Devouring insects were ancient anomalous creatures, naturally a type of rare insect and exotic beast; they were originally obtained on the Tongxuan Continent and had long resided on the Six-Colored Treasure Isle within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, nurtured by the Warm Spirit Lotus.

When he first obtained them they weren't particularly strong—only invincible against those below the Saint Realm; if a Transcendent Realm warrior's Sea of Consciousness were invaded by them, death would come in an instant.

Later, after a massive devouring mutation and years of nurturing by the Warm Spirit Lotus, the Soul-Devouring insects became much stronger, but were still only effective against fighters of the Saint Realm; those of the Saint King Realm could easily exterminate them. As Yang Kai's power rose, these insects had grown less useful.

Yang Kai hadn't abandoned them, however, and allowed them to reproduce and develop on their own.

If not for today's appearance of the Zhi Stone, which caused the Soul-Devouring insects to react differently, Yang Kai might have forgotten they even existed.

It was precisely because the Soul-Devouring insects became excited that Yang Kai was able to discreetly snap up the Zhi Stone.

Now, hearing Yang Flame's explanation, Yang Kai immediately realized he'd bought a treasure—the one hundred fifty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals had not been wasted. If the Zhi Stone could truly let the Soul-Devouring insects advance and evolve to contend with Saint King Realm or even Origin Returning Realm fighters, its value would be immense.

"What rare insects and exotic beasts do you have?" Yang Flame asked curiously.

"I'll tell you when we get back," Yang Kai said with a mysterious smile.

Yang Flame looked at him oddly and fell silent.

"Look, those twin forks up for auction!" Wu Yi suddenly cried out excitedly; she knew better than to reveal it had been forged by Yang Flame, so she didn't dare name her.

Yang Kai and Yang Flame turned their gaze to the auction stage and indeed saw the twin forks make a grand appearance—and it wasn't the only Origin-Grade Secret Treasure on display.

A row of twelve palace-clad women, each bearing a jade tray with a Secret Treasure, all Origin-Grade Lower-Level, their auras shimmering with oppressive spiritual qi, instantly drew everyone's attention.

The beautiful auctioneer smiled and announced, "You should all be clear on what we're selling this round: twelve Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasures. As you well know, one of Dark Star's three Forbidden Lands, the Flowing Flame Sandland, is about to open. This is a once-in-hundreds-of-years great opportunity. To enter the Flowing Flame Sandland you must have sufficient strength—and excellent equipment. These twelve Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasures are precisely what Jubao Tower specially gathered for the imminent opening of the Flowing Flame Sandland, meant to give you means to survive and search for treasures. Origin-Grade Secret Treasures are scarce on Dark Star; Jubao Tower exhausted great effort to collect these twelve items, and many disciples died..."

The auctioneer rambled on atop the stage; Yang Kai frowned and asked Wu Yi curiously, "What are the Three Forbidden Lands?"

Wu Yi pursed her lips and smiled, "You haven't been on Dark Star long, of course you haven't heard. The Three Forbidden Lands have a notorious reputation across Dark Star; people shudder at the name. The first is what she called the Flowing Flame Sandland: it spans who knows how many miles and is perpetually shrouded in blazing heat. Even the outermost heat cannot be withstood by normal means. Once an Origin Returning Realm expert, confident in his strength, rushed in to hunt treasures; no matter his power or preparations, the moment he entered the Flowing Flame Sandland he was melted, and even his Secret Treasure was consumed."

"That powerful?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"Yes, and that is only the peripheral heat. They say further inside, even a Void King Realm cultivator couldn't withstand it—though that's only hearsay; there are no Void King Realm figures on Dark Star, so no one truly knows what such a realm can do." Wu Yi smiled sweetly.

"Then why did the woman say the Flowing Flame Sandland is about to open?" Yang Kai frowned; if it's a place that kills anyone who enters, who would be foolish enough to go in? Nobody wants to die.

"Because that place's heat wanes every so often; the intervals are irregular—maybe decades, maybe centuries. Once the heat weakens, warriors can enter. I read in my family's records that the last time the Flowing Flame Sandland opened was four hundred years ago, so it has been unentered for four centuries."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened; a place unvisited for four hundred years must hide countless treasures. No wonder the auctioneer called it a momentous opportunity.

Yang Kai knew many heaven-and-earth treasures favor hot environments; the hotter they are, the more they thrive—there might well be such treasures in the Flowing Flame Sandland.

But what excited him most wasn't those treasures, it was the heat itself—perfect for refining his Profound Yin Moon Water.

Zong Ao of Rainfall Star had once said that to refine Profound Yin Moon Water one must find a place of extremely high temperature.

He possessed more than twenty drops of Profound Yin Moon Water and had already gathered the materials for refining; now he only needed a suitable location, and the Flowing Flame Sandland fit the bill.

If he could refine even a single drop, his strength would certainly rise again.

Wu Yi continued, "The second Forbidden Land is the Imperial Garden; it is said to have once been the private garden of a Star Domain Emperor."

Yang Kai shivered, "A Star Domain Emperor?"

"Yes, a legendary, mighty figure. It's said that long ago the entire Hengluo Star Domain was governed by a Star Domain Emperor, but for unknown reasons he vanished—no one knows where he went."

Yang Kai felt a stir in his heart; he'd heard rumors of the Star Emperor on the Floating Continent from Shen Tu and had dismissed them, thinking the tales fabricated—but now it might be true, since even a backwater cultivation star like Dark Star harbors such legends.

A Star Emperor ruling a Star Domain—what unimaginable power must that be?

Not to mention a Star Lord; Yang Kai had never seen one himself—he only knew that to become a Star Lord one needed at least Void King Realm cultivation and to dare fuse Stellar Origin; failure meant death even for someone at Void King Realm.

"The Flowing Flame Sandland always exists but cannot be entered; the Imperial Garden appears intermittently and vanishes without a trace—no one knows its location. It occasionally manifests, drawing many inside, but none return alive. Only under special circumstances will the Imperial Garden stabilize; if it does, it is another colossal opportunity!"

Yang Kai listened with rising excitement—the private garden of a Star Emperor was sure to contain innumerable heaven-and-earth treasures, making mouths water.

"The third Forbidden Land lies on the sea: a Ghost Isle, equally perilous. If the Flowing Flame Sandland always exists and the Imperial Garden appears occasionally, then the Ghost Isle really leaves no trace—no one has seen or found it; those who've seen it all died." Wu Yi's words were dark and chilling, making Yang Flame shiver—the girl had always been timid.

"If no one has seen it, then how do people know of the Ghost Isle?" Yang Kai frowned; this third Forbidden Land seemed the least credible.

Wu Yi smiled faintly, "If everyone knows of it, then its existence is plausible—so it must exist."

Yang Kai didn't press the matter, but the imminent opening of the Flowing Flame Sandland had him excited; there was no better place for refining Profound Yin Moon Water.

Zong Ao had said that when refining Profound Yin Moon Water, as long as it remained within one's tolerance, the higher the ambient temperature the better—the greater the heat, the more it could trigger the power of Profound Yin Moon Water.

Should he go? Yang Kai secretly weighed the idea.
