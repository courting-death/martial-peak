## Chapter 2365 — Spiritual Qi

After handling these matters, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense. Moments later his figure flickered and he appeared before Incarnation, Liu Yan, and the others.

"Master, are you alright?" Liu Yan asked joyfully as soon as she saw Yang Kai appear.

A few days ago, when she sensed Yang Kai entering the Small Xuan Realm, she went to check on him, only to find him entangled by Demonic Qi. She had been worried ever since.

Incarnation and Hua Qingsi were also deeply concerned.

Now, seeing Yang Kai so lively, they knew he had resolved the Demonic Qi problem.

Yang Kai grinned, “Yes, I’ve come back to life!”

Hua Qingsi said seriously, "Are you sure there are no aftereffects? You must not be careless."

"Don’t worry, Sister Hua." As Yang Kai spoke, he suddenly reached into his Spatial Ring and took out an item, handing it to Hua Qingsi. "This is for you."

Hua Qingsi accepted it warily, then her expression changed as she exclaimed, "Imperial Treasure?"

What Yang Kai gave her was the five-colored spear previously used by Yao Changjun. After their life-and-death battle, before entering the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai had snatched this Imperial Treasure and Yao Changjun’s ring.

Liu Yan already had the Extinction Thunder Bead, and Hua Qingsi had always been loyal to Yang Kai, so the five-colored spear could naturally be entrusted to her.

"Imperial Treasure is powerful, but a martial artist’s foundation is most important. Sister Hua, don’t neglect your roots for the sake of the treasure," Yang Kai said calmly.

Hua Qingsi played with the five-colored spear, her face showing she loved it dearly. She nodded and teased, "I know, do you really need to lecture me?"

Yang Kai chuckled and rubbed his nose.

Yang Kai hadn’t had a chance to check Yao Changjun’s Spatial Ring yet. Now, taking it out and looking inside, he found many valuable items.

There were over a hundred million Source Crystals, most of which were Middle-Level and Upper-Level. As a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, Yao Changjun having such wealth was no surprise to Yang Kai.

With his cultivation, how could he possibly be poor?

Besides Source Crystals, there were also many Spiritual Pills, herbs, and Secret Treasures, though none were Imperial Treasures.

After a brief inspection, Yang Kai suddenly remembered something and asked in surprise, "Where is Liu Qianyun?"

Earlier, Liu Qianyun had fainted. During the fight with Yao Changjun, to avoid harming her, Yang Kai had tossed her into the Small Xuan Realm, but now she was nowhere to be seen.

Liu Yan said, "I settled her in the pavilion. She’s already awake, but seems confused about her situation."

"You didn’t explain anything to her?"

"No," Liu Yan shook her head. She hadn’t even shown her face to Liu Qianyun, let alone explained.

"I’ll go take a look," Yang Kai said, vanishing on the spot.

In the pavilion, Liu Qianyun wore a serious expression, her beautiful eyes full of confusion.

When she woke up, she found herself in this pavilion, not knowing where she was. After checking the surroundings, she found no danger and no one nearby, but the Spiritual Qi here was unusually dense.

Liu Qianyun had never seen anywhere with Spiritual Qi as concentrated as this. Such rich Spiritual Qi made this an absolute Sacred Land for cultivation. She barely needed to circulate her technique; the Spiritual Qi flowed into her body on its own.

If she could cultivate here for a long time, she might soon break through her bottleneck and advance to the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

But she was focused on figuring out where she was, so she didn’t have the heart to cultivate. What unsettled her most was that Yang Kai was nowhere to be found. After searching for days, she even wondered if she’d been abandoned.

At that moment, as she sat sadly in the pavilion, pondering her future, a figure suddenly flashed before her—Yang Kai appeared mysteriously.

"Senior Brother..." As soon as Liu Qianyun saw Yang Kai, she felt she’d found her anchor and rushed over, her anxious expression relaxing.

Yang Kai smiled slightly. "Something happened, so I was delayed a few days."

"As long as Senior Brother is alright." Liu Qianyun looked Yang Kai up and down, seeing his energetic state, and finally relaxed. She asked, "Senior Brother, do you know where this is? Weren’t we swallowed by that huge vortex?"

Her memory was still stuck on the incident at Jixu Ridge. Recalling the irresistible power of the vortex, her face paled.

"Yes, we were swallowed, and then we landed on a vast sea."

"A sea?" Liu Qianyun was even more confused. She’d explored the area these past days and found no sea, only a pleasant environment with many buildings, clearly once inhabited.

If she could stay here with Senior Brother, it wouldn’t be a bad place.

Yang Kai scratched his head, unsure how to explain the situation to Liu Qianyun. "I’ll show you, then you’ll understand."

As he spoke, Yang Kai activated his power and took Liu Qianyun out of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

As soon as they appeared, a fishy stench assaulted them, followed by strange noises from all directions, even the sound of a heartbeat.

Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense and immediately understood their situation.

Earlier, to enter the Small Xuan Realm and seal the Demonic Qi, Yang Kai hadn’t paid attention to the Xuan Realm Pearl’s descent, letting it sink into the depths of the sea. After several days, it had somehow ended up inside a giant fish’s belly.

Apparently, the giant fish had swallowed the Xuan Realm Pearl and carried them along as it swam, destination unknown.

Realizing this, Yang Kai activated his power. Golden Blood Threads shot out, dancing wildly, and he cut open a hole in the fish’s back, leaping out with Liu Qianyun.

The fish was large but not a powerful Demonic Beast. Yang Kai’s actions caused it unbearable pain, making it thrash in the sea as blood spread everywhere. It looked like it wouldn’t survive.

In the next moment, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun burst out of the water. Yang Kai immediately summoned a wooden boat and pulled Liu Qianyun aboard.

A faint fishy wind blew from the sea, and the scenery was endless blue waves and sky. Countless waterspouts filled the area, each radiating devouring power, making the place extremely dangerous.

Liu Qianyun was stunned.

She still hadn’t figured out where they’d been before, and now suddenly found herself on a vast sea, leaving her at a loss.

"After we were swallowed by the vortex, we ended up here." Yang Kai scanned the surroundings but saw no sign of land, feeling a bit disappointed.

"Where is this?" Liu Qianyun asked in shock.

"According to Yao Changjun and Pang Guang, this seems to be the Jixu Secret Realm!" Yang Kai frowned.

"Jixu Secret Realm?" Liu Qianyun looked blank, clearly unfamiliar. She’d only been in Gao City a few years and didn’t know much about the local secrets, so she’d never heard of the Jixu Secret Realm.

"Yao Changjun and Pang Guang are here too?" Liu Qianyun was startled, realizing belatedly.

"Don’t worry, they’ve gone somewhere else." Yang Kai replied casually, not telling Liu Qianyun that Yao Changjun was dead, since it was too bizarre. Pang Guang really had left.

"So what do we do now?"

"Since we’re here, let’s make the best of it." Yang Kai sighed. "First, let’s see if anyone else lives here and gather information, then look for a way out."

"Alright, Senior Brother, I’ll follow your lead." Liu Qianyun had no ideas of her own and could only rely on Yang Kai.

With that, Yang Kai steered the wooden boat in a chosen direction.

The sea was endless. Yang Kai couldn’t tell east from west, so he picked a direction and kept flying, hoping to find something.

But the countless waterspouts on the sea caused him great trouble.

Each waterspout was filled with powerful strangling and devouring force. If one fell in, even a Dao Origin Realm cultivator might not escape safely.

To escape the devouring force of the waterspouts, Yang Kai expended a huge amount of energy.

After three full days, the two still found nothing, as if the sea had no end. Even the usually calm Yang Kai grew uneasy. If they kept searching without finding land, would they have to fly forever?

At this rate, they’d die sooner or later. Though he had the Small Xuan Realm to avoid danger and recover, without an exit, they’d be trapped here for life.

"Junior Sister, you take over steering. I need to recover for a while." Yang Kai called to Liu Qianyun, transferring control of the boat to her.

"Alright." Liu Qianyun had long wanted to help Yang Kai, so she accepted without hesitation.

"Be careful of those waterspouts. If you see a big one, go around it—don’t try to force through. They’re dangerous." Yang Kai warned, then sat cross-legged, popped a few recovery Spiritual Pills into his mouth, and began to meditate.

The Spiritual Qi in the Jixu Secret Realm was extremely dense. Though not as rich as his Small Xuan Realm, it was comparable to the Sacred Lands of major sects.

Yang Kai thought that with the help of Spiritual Pills, he’d recover quickly.

But as time passed, he felt something was wrong.

The Spiritual Qi absorbed from the world seemed to contain another strange, indescribable substance. When it entered his body, it was like countless sharp needles, constantly pricking his meridians and flesh, causing unbearable pain.

The more he cultivated, the more of that strange substance he drew into his body.

After half an hour, Yang Kai suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, his face extremely pale.

"Senior Brother, what’s wrong?" Liu Qianyun’s face changed. Yang Kai was clearly recovering his Origin Qi, so why did he suddenly spit blood as if he’d suffered a heavy blow? There were no enemies nearby.

"There’s something strange about the Spiritual Qi here. You can’t absorb it—the more you do, the more trouble you’ll have!" Yang Kai gritted his teeth, wiped his mouth, and warned.
