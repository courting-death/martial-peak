## Chapter 2423 — This Is a Big Deal!

Yang Kai had always been concerned about Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline. He possessed an Ethereal Jade Disc, which resonated only with Zhang Ruoxi. Whenever it did, strange and beautiful visions would flash across the Ethereal Jade Disc. All this time, Yang Kai had never figured out what use the Ethereal Jade Disc actually had.

Moreover, back in the Four Seasons Land, Zhang Ruoxi had said she encountered the Ancient Divine Spirit Qiong Qi. Not only did that ferocious beast not harm her, it even gifted her the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress. That Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress was an Imperial Treasure, a particularly high-grade defensive one at that!

This matter made Yang Kai especially attentive. He vaguely suspected it was related to Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline, but he could never find the answer.

Perhaps, once Zhang Ruoxi’s strength grew even greater, she would be able to figure out the truth of her own bloodline.

Time slipped by. After Yang Kai finished checking the two Spatial Rings, he made a trip to the Small Xuan Realm, distributing some cultivation resources to Hua Qingsi, Liu Yan, Zhang Ruoxi, and the others. Only then did he return to his room.

Before he could do anything else, a suffocating sensation suddenly swept down from the sky.

Yang Kai’s expression changed, and he instantly became alert.

That feeling just now was definitely caused by an expert sweeping the area with Divine Sense. Although it vanished quickly, Yang Kai still sensed the other party’s strength. An expert at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm could never put this kind of pressure on him. Only someone at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm could do so!

The Wenqing Sect Master, Feng Xuan, had arrived!

This thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind, and he hurriedly rushed out of the room.

Outside the inn, An Ruoyun and the others all wore grave expressions, clearly having sensed something as well.

Not far away, the Emperor Realm experts who had come to offer congratulations also looked solemn. Although they had known since yesterday that Feng Xuan would arrive today, and that a fierce clash was likely if he met Bing Yun, now that the moment had come, everyone still felt the atmosphere was so oppressive it was hard to breathe.

Boom, boom, boom…

From the distant sky, explosions rang out one after another, each one closer than the last. With each thunderous sound, a figure shot toward them like a ghost. At first, it was impossible to see clearly, but in just three breaths, the figure suddenly descended above Binglun City, arriving in front of the inn.

In an instant, a kingly pressure swept out, enveloping all of Binglun City in a roar. Space trembled, as if even heaven and earth were about to submit.

Hu Yuan and the others looked up and hurriedly bowed. “We greet Sect Master Feng!”

In the sky, a man stood proudly. With a wave of his hand, he said, “No need for such formality, everyone!”

His every movement seemed to contain profound mysteries, in harmony with the ultimate truths of heaven and earth. Law Power swirled around him. Hu Yuan and the others felt a subtle force lift them up, and they were deeply shocked, realizing the gap between themselves and Feng Xuan was as vast as the sky and the earth.

Yang Kai looked up and saw a middle-aged man dressed as a scholar standing in the sky. This man bore a slight resemblance to Feng Xi, but was far more dignified and striking—indeed, he was even more handsome and extraordinary than Feng Xi.

This was undoubtedly the Wenqing Sect Master, Feng Xuan. Whether he was born this way or it was the result of cultivating the Supreme Sentiment Art, no one could say. Coupled with the warm smile on his face, everyone who saw him felt as if they were bathed in a spring breeze.

Yet Yang Kai felt extremely uncomfortable. No wonder—at this moment, Feng Xi and Yao Zhuo were both standing behind Feng Xuan, glaring at Yang Kai with gritted teeth, as if they wanted to devour him alive.

The other night, both of their Spatial Rings had been taken by Yang Kai. Outnumbered, they had no choice but to compromise. Feng Xi, in particular, had lost all face. Now that Feng Xuan was here, they had a powerful backer and their confidence had returned. Secretly, they vowed to take revenge and let Yang Kai know the consequences of offending them.

Feng Xuan merely glanced at Yang Kai, then paid him no further attention. After all, a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator was no more than an ant in his eyes. His gaze was deep, as if it could pierce the void, and he looked toward a certain spot with a faint smile. “Bing Yun, it’s been three thousand years since we last met. Today, we finally reunite. This Lord is gratified!”

With those words, the surroundings trembled.

Whether it was the dozen or so Emperor Realm experts from Ice Heart Valley, or the various Sect experts who had come to offer congratulations, all had only guessed that Bing Yun was staying in the inn. No one dared to casually release Divine Sense to investigate.

An Ruoyun and the others had knelt at the inn’s entrance for a whole day and night, yet Bing Yun had still not appeared. Hu Yuan and the others even began to doubt whether Bing Yun was still inside.

If she was, why hadn’t she come out? Why let her disciples kneel here for all to see?

But Feng Xuan’s words dispelled everyone’s doubts.

Bing Yun was definitely inside the inn! Otherwise, Feng Xuan would never have said such a thing.

Now that Feng Xuan had personally arrived in Binglun City, Bing Yun would have to show herself no matter what. If she didn’t, it would be a grave discourtesy.

Yet, contrary to everyone’s expectations, after Feng Xuan called out, there was still no movement from within the inn. Even An Ruoyun and the others kneeling at the door showed no reaction.

Hu Yuan and the others waited quietly for a while, feeling the atmosphere grow increasingly tense. Cold sweat broke out on their foreheads, and a vague sense of unease crept in.

Sure enough, Feng Xuan’s face gradually darkened. He could sense that Bing Yun was inside the inn, but for her to ignore his greeting was a clear slight. In front of so many experts from the Northern Territory, how could Feng Xuan back down?

“Bing Yun, after all this time, you’ve grown quite arrogant, haven’t you?” Feng Xuan sneered coldly, clearly displeased.

Over there, An Ruoyun frowned slightly and called out, “Sect Master Feng, my Master is currently occupied with important matters and cannot respond. Please wait a moment.”

“Important matters?” Feng Xuan raised his eyebrows, as if thinking of something, then nodded slightly. “Very well, this Lord will wait here.”

At that moment, Feng Xi, who had been glaring hatefully at Yang Kai, suddenly leaned in to whisper a few words to Feng Xuan, then pointed in Yang Kai’s direction.

In the next instant, Feng Xuan’s eyes flashed with sharp light, his gaze locking onto the space behind Yang Kai. Suddenly, he barked out, “You there, boy!”

That shout seemed to carry a subtle trace of Divine Soul power. Yang Kai felt his head buzz, and he was suddenly dizzy. Alarmed, he hurriedly circulated his Divine Sense to resist. In his Sea of Consciousness, the Warm Spirit Lotus spun rapidly, radiating multicolored light.

Gentle power rose from his Sea of Consciousness, and Yang Kai finally felt a bit better. Still, blood trickled from his nose and mouth, and he felt utterly drained, his legs nearly giving out beneath him.

Fortunately, with the Warm Spirit Lotus as his foundation, he managed to hold on, only staggering slightly.

After steadying himself, a surge of anger flared up in Yang Kai’s heart.

Feng Xuan had attacked him covertly, so secretly that no one else noticed; he had even tried to force him to his knees. This was clearly meant as a show of force.

If, in front of so many people, he had been forced to his knees by Feng Xuan’s shout, everyone would have laughed at his weakness. This humiliating experience would have become a heart demon on his Martial Dao, and if he couldn’t overcome it, his path would end here.

Feng Xuan was truly insidious and despicable! Yang Kai’s teeth ground audibly as he seethed with boundless rage.

Over there, Feng Xuan raised his eyebrows, showing a look of surprise.

Yang Kai hadn’t collapsed to his knees as expected, which astonished him. He had held back to avoid drawing attention, but even so, a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator shouldn’t have been able to withstand it. Even a First Stage Emperor Realm expert, if caught off guard, would have lost their composure and made a fool of themselves.

Yet this young man had only staggered. How strange.

Still, Feng Xuan didn’t care much. The gap in strength was so great that Yang Kai simply wasn’t worth his attention.

As he pondered, Yang Kai wiped the blood from his nose and mouth, then sneered, “Well, the Wenqing Sect really is full of trash who only know how to bully the weak! The Vice Sect Master is like this, and so is the Sect Master. Today, I’ve truly broadened my horizons. Why call yourselves the Wenqing Sect? You should change your name to the Bully Sect!”

With those words, Feng Xuan’s expression changed slightly.

He hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so bold, mocking him to his face even after suffering a loss.

Hu Yuan and the others gaped, cold sweat beading on their foreheads. Although they hadn’t noticed exactly what happened, everyone had seen Yang Kai bleeding from his nose and mouth, so they guessed he must have suffered at Feng Xuan’s shout.

But even so, he shouldn’t be making such a fuss.

Did this brat never taste death before, so he doesn’t even know how the word is written?

An Ruoyun and the others were also slow to react. Seeing Yang Kai’s pale face, they cried out in alarm, “Young Master, are you alright?”

Yang Kai sneered, “I was ambushed by a despicable scoundrel. My heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are all gravely injured—how could I be alright? This is a big deal!”

Hearing this, An Ruoyun immediately knew he was fine, but he was deliberately exaggerating, so she rolled her eyes at him.

Hu Yuan and the others were all left dizzy. If his heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys were truly so badly injured, how could he still be speaking so energetically? No one knew where this kid had come from, but he was certainly reckless and ignorant of the dangers of the world. For a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator to challenge the Sect Master of Feng Xuan, he was truly young and hot-blooded.

It was a wonder this guy was still alive.

The tense atmosphere was suddenly made comical by his antics.

"Watch your mouth, boy!" Feng Xuan was secretly annoyed by Yang Kai’s exaggerations. His shout had contained Divine Soul power; had Yang Kai been injured, it would have affected his Sea of Consciousness, not his internal organs.
