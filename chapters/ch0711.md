## Chapter 711 — Something's Stirring

"Exactly so!" The elder surnamed Chang's face went ashen, yet he forced a smile and nodded; being put on the spot by Du Wan, how could he deny it in front of a junior? He ground his teeth and said through his clenched jaw, "I, Chang, am very generous."

As he spoke, his skin twitched with rage, as if he longed to give Du Wan a good beating.

"Then I'll take these two." Yang Kai immediately pulled two medicinal ingredients from his Spatial Pouch.

The elder Chang glanced at them; his expression suddenly relaxed. He snatched the Spatial Pouch from Yang Kai and magnanimously said, "Take them, take them!"

From his manner, it was clear the things he cared most about had not been taken, so he felt much relieved.

Yang Kai naturally was not so malicious. This time he had already secured a great bargain—he had taken two Saint-Grade materials from the Spatial Pouch, and he was pleased.

With those two Saint-Grade herbs as guiding ingredients, Yang Kai could refine two Saint Pills.

After dealing with the first Spatial Pouch, Yang Kai examined the second; his Divine Sense swept through it and his eyes lit up.

Inside that Spatial Pouch he found an ingredient he urgently needed—the Dew-Congealing Herb.

On the list Li Rong had given him, the Dew-Congealing Herb was also a must; its growing conditions were extremely harsh. Though it could exist anywhere on the continent, the rarity of suitable conditions made it seldom appear.

The Dew-Congealing Herb in this Spatial Pouch, in both form and age, had reached perfection; it was clearly a supreme-grade herb.

Yang Kai accepted it without courtesy, and casually took another Saint-Grade herb from the same Spatial Pouch.

The third Spatial Pouch and the fourth yielded little as well, each containing only two ingredients.

When he came to the last Spatial Pouch, Yang Kai inspected it carefully.

After a moment he showed some disappointment—this pouch also lacked what he wanted. Just as he prepared to pick any two items at random, his expression shifted; he stared blankly at something inside the pouch.

After a while he gave a faint smile. "These two, then."

As he spoke, he took out two objects.

Everyone peered closer and revealed odd expressions; one of the items Yang Kai produced was a Saint-Grade herb like the others, but the other was a jet-black round stone.

"What's that?" Du Wan glanced over suspiciously and asked.

The other elders examined it as well and all shook their heads in puzzlement.

No one could recognize what the black stone was.

The owner of the Spatial Pouch also shook his head repeatedly. "Don't look to me, I don't know either. I just thought the stone odd and kept it in the pouch. It's been there for decades and I've never figured out its use. Young friend, do you know?"

He asked, turning expectantly to Yang Kai.

"I don't know either," Yang Kai replied. "I only took it out because it looked strange."

"Oh. Then it's yours; after all, I never understood its composition in all these years," the pouch owner said generously.

"Thanks to the elders," Yang Kai chuckled and slid the jet-black round stone into his Black Book Space.

The wager was concluded; Yang Kai excused himself with a word and jumped down from the high platform.

The old men wanted to say more, but found themselves unable to do so and could only let him leave.

"Du Wan. You mustn't let him go astray. He absolutely must achieve something in alchemy—such a promising seed is rare. I don't want to see him ruined."

"Yes, Du Wan, when you return you must persuade him properly. If you can't, I'll bring him back to San Chuan City myself."

Du Wan could only smile bitterly. He also found it hard to understand why Yang Kai clung so stubbornly to martial cultivation—in this world most people cultivated and could be called martial artists.

But alchemists were exceedingly rare; among ten thousand martial artists there might not even be one alchemist, and those with aptitude in alchemy were even scarcer.

A brilliantly gifted, supremely skilled alchemist earned respect wherever he went; that kid couldn't possibly fail to see the difference between martial artists and alchemists.

……

After returning from the square with Fei Yu, Yang Kai immediately reported to Cang Yan and the others the result of his negotiations with Zhai Yao.

After hearing him, Cang Yan nodded slightly. "Then our chances have certainly increased. Since that fellow is Ao Gu's honored guest, Ao Gu will not slight him. The bodyguards assigned to him will at least include a Third Stage Transcendent Realm expert, that's a conservative estimate."

"Senior Uncle, how long before the Thousand-Year Demon Flower will bloom?"

"I don't know exactly, but according to records there will be strange portents before the Thousand-Year Demon Flower blooms; when those appear, we'll know."

"There are already many people stationed on that peak waiting for the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, some even on Wangtian Cliff. But the closer you get, the more dangerous it becomes, so there's no need to rush," Li Wan chuckled. "Junior Nephew, rest well for now. When the time comes, we'll take you there."

"Mm." Yang Kai replied.

Back in his room, Yang Kai sat cross-legged and pulled two jet-black round stones from his Black Book Space.

"Wasn't this the same stone you got last time in that predecessor's grotto?" Fei Yu exclaimed in surprise. "How come there's another one?"

"I just found this one in the Spatial Pouch of an elder alchemist," Yang Kai explained. Because the two were the same material and size, he chose the jet-black round stone. "Senior Aunt, what on earth are these for?"

"I don't know. It's the first time I've seen something like this," Fei Yu shook her head.

"Strange," Yang Kai said, perplexed. That elder alchemist had also been unable to identify what the stone was or its use; he had claimed to have kept it for decades without uncovering any secret.

Yang Kai instinctively felt those two jet-black stones were not simple.

He roasted them with his True Yuan and probed them with his Divine Sense—both efforts yielded nothing.

After struggling with them for a while, Yang Kai reluctantly gave up and stored them away again.

In the days that followed, Yang Kai remained secluded in the inn, maintaining the perfect condition he would need to face the impending battle.

His senior aunt and uncles were also making close preparations.

One dawn, while meditating, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes. In that instant he felt the Heaven-and-Earth Energy around him behaving strangely.

It was as if an invisible force tugged at it, drawing it together and concentrating toward one direction.

Before he could investigate further, the phenomenon suddenly intensified violently.

Even inside his room a fierce wind whipped up, making the doors and windows groan.

Fei Yu opened her eyes in alarm. "This is—"

Her eyes shone strangely as she hurried to the window and cried out excitedly, "The Thousand-Year Demon Flower is about to bloom!"

Yang Kai's spirit jolted.

In the neighboring room the rustling of clothing sounded—Cang Yan and the others had already moved. Yang Kai and Fei Yu barely glanced and, without hesitation, leaped out the window.

At the same time, the whole of Fuyun City erupted; countless martial artists poured into the streets from all directions and stared toward the peak several dozen li away.

"The Thousand-Year Demon Flower is showing signs!" someone shouted.

That call sent everyone into a frenzy.

Yang Kai squinted toward the peak. At the horizon he saw a riot of colors illuminating the sky; Heaven-and-Earth Energy frenziedly surged toward that place, and Fuyun City descended into chaos.

"Move!" Cang Yan barked, wrapping himself in a shimmering rainbow light and racing in that direction.

The others followed close behind.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Scores of people strained themselves as they rushed toward the mountain.

In an instant Yang Kai realized how fierce the competition would be here—Transcendent Realm experts were everywhere. Though Third Stage figures were rare, their number greatly exceeded Cang Yan's earlier estimate.

From Fuyun City alone three to four hundred Transcendent Realm experts had already surged out, not to mention those who had long been stationed on the mountain itself.

Conservatively estimated, this time perhaps five hundred Transcendent Realm experts would take part.

That terrifying number made Yang Kai's scalp tingle.

On high, at the city lord's mansion, Ao Gu, Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao stood watching the mountain; their faces were grave.

"It seems the Master has also gone," Jin Jiao observed as a few figures emerged from the mansion.

"Huh? Isn't the Master a Saint Realm expert? If he goes, the Thousand-Year Demon Flower won't be able to bloom," Zhou Liang said in alarm.

"Don't worry," Ao Gu said calmly. "The Master appears to have taken some Pill to temporarily suppress his cultivation. After all, when the Thousand-Year Demon Flower bloomed last time it was he who refined the elixir; he knows more about these matters than anyone."

At that Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao both breathed a sigh of relief.

Although they had met the Master only once, they had already received benefits beyond imagination from him.

A single Saint Pill refined by the Master had greatly improved both their bodies and their souls. While the three have not grown much further in cultivation since then, anyone could feel the gain in their strength.

That the Master would come to Fuyun City was an unexpected boon none of them had dared hope for.

To repay the Master's kindness, Ao Gu and the others spared no effort, deploying the mansion's most capable retainers to guard the Master's disciple.

The human, yao and demon tribes together fielded six Transcendent Realm experts for protection—two at the Third Stage and four at the Second Stage—an impressive escort.

Ao Gu and the others had planned to seize the medicinal fluid from the Thousand-Year Demon Flower themselves; though they no longer needed it, friends and family still did.

But with the Master present, they found it improper to make a grab.

Fuyun City's Transcendent Realm experts tore off like the wind, racing toward the mountain peak.

Before they reached the foot of the peak, fighting had already broken out.

No one wished another to take the lead; each considered the others enemies. The impatient naturally wanted to strike first—small skirmishes flared into battles and then expanded, drawing in more and more experts.
