## Chapter 2103 — All Means Unleashed

"Troublesome... His Demonic Qi can even corrode our Imperial Treasures!" Chen Wenhao glanced at the Scorching Sun Mirror in Gao Xueting's hand, then at his own Waterflow Sword, his expression grave.

Like the Scorching Sun Mirror, the Waterflow Sword was shrouded in a faint black mist, clearly eroded by Demonic Qi.

Though this level of erosion wouldn't immediately damage the spirit of an Imperial Treasure, if left unchecked, it would eventually cause severe loss of spirit.

The birth of every Imperial Treasure was a rare event, cherished by every Emperor Realm expert. How could they allow such a thing to happen?

"What a troublesome fellow. Looks like we have to get serious," Feng Ming snorted coldly.

Chen Wenhao kept his eyes fixed on Yang Kai, but spoke to Gao Xueting at his side: "Junior Sister Gao, we'll need your strength."

Gao Xueting bit her silver teeth, as if making a firm decision. "If the Scorching Sun Mirror is destroyed, you two will have to compensate me."

Feng Ming laughed, "It's an Imperial Treasure—how could it be destroyed so easily? Enough talk, delays breed mishaps!"

Only then did Gao Xueting raise her hand, sending the Scorching Sun Mirror soaring into the sky, as if piercing the clouds. Soon, the mirror merged with the blazing sun above.

Gao Xueting's slender hand danced, forming intricate seals.

A mysterious power spread from the Scorching Sun Mirror, its surface humming. From the boundless sky, the blazing sun shot a dazzling beam straight onto the mirror, which then radiated in all directions.

"Scorching Sun Domain, Nine Suns Shine Together!" Gao Xueting crossed her arms before her chest and slowly pushed forward.

Blazing flame-like light swept outward.

The small world sealed by Yang Kai's Space Law emitted cracking sounds, as if some force was breaking its confinement.

Immediately, a strange phenomenon manifested.

Nine blazing suns materialized in the sky, their dazzling light nearly blinding. The heat from their rays scorched the earth below.

Yang Kai roared, seemingly unable to withstand the encirclement of so many suns. He struck first.

He charged forward, meeting one of the blazing suns head-on and punched it.

Boom...

The sun hanging overhead shattered instantly.

But in moments, a new sun appeared elsewhere in the sky.

Yang Kai, like a madman, smashed another sun, but the same scene repeated, rendering his efforts futile.

"It's useless. In Lady Gao's Scorching Sun Domain, such attacks have no effect."

Hua Qingsi seemed familiar with the Scorching Sun Domain. Watching Yang Kai rush about in the Small Xuan Realm, she shook her head and gloated.

The Incarnation's eyes spun. "Then what kind of attack would work?"

"Naturally, you have to attack Lady Gao's true body," Hua Qingsi replied with a giggle. "But in the Scorching Sun Domain, Lady Gao is omnipotent. The figure you see is just a projection; her real body is hidden somewhere."

"Is that so?" The Incarnation smiled meaningfully. "You know quite a lot—not surprising, coming from Star God Palace."

Hua Qingsi smiled proudly.

If not for her background in the Star God Palace, the supreme force of the Southern Territory, how could she, as a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, know the secrets of Gao Xueting's techniques?

While Yang Kai frantically attacked the annoying suns, a figure appeared at his side. Sword Law gathered on the longsword, and with slow, cautious movements, stabbed toward him.

"Three Thousand Sword Dao!" Chen Wenhao intoned.

As the sword thrust out, the nine blazing suns seemed to pale. Between heaven and earth, only this sword, forged from Chen Wenhao's life's work, remained.

Sword light flashed, blood sprayed, Demonic Qi surged — Yang Kai howled.

This sword finally achieved a great feat, piercing Yang Kai's chest and abdomen, drawing a spray of Golden Blood.

In pain, Yang Kai grabbed the Waterflow Sword with his dragon claw, ignoring the blade's sharpness cutting his palm. His other hand transformed into a Sky-Covering Giant Palm, slamming down on Chen Wenhao.

Chen Wenhao's eyes narrowed, wanting to retreat, but was shocked to find the strange Space Law enveloping him again, freezing his movements.

In that brief delay, Yang Kai's palm was already upon him.

"Transposition Shift!" Gao Xueting's voice rang out. She pressed her palms together and pushed forward. One of the blazing suns in the sky suddenly replaced Chen Wenhao, and was smashed to pieces by the giant palm.

Not far away, Chen Wenhao's figure reappeared, his face pale. He nodded to Gao Xueting in thanks.

If not for Gao Xueting's secret technique, he would have been injured.

"Did you forget someone?" A voice sounded behind Yang Kai. While he was entangled with Chen Wenhao, Feng Ming charged in with the Yanlei Spear, its tip gathering Origin Qi and erupting.

"Yanlei Burst!"

At the spear’s tip, a colossal thunder orb suddenly formed, packed with lightning fierce enough to rend heaven and earth, and it detonated abruptly at Yang Kai’s side.

Wild lightning danced, silver snakes darted, and the earth became an electric domain.

For a moment, the Demonic Qi on Yang Kai's back vanished, revealing a body of bare bones.

This strike seemed to inflict great damage on him.

Before Feng Ming could rejoice, Yang Kai spun around and slapped at him.

"Looking down on me?" Feng Ming saw Yang Kai's brazen attack and grew furious, thrusting his spear again.

But this time, he struck only empty air.

The figure ahead vanished.

Feng Ming instinctively tensed, withdrawing his spear and retreating, his face wary.

After all, he was fighting a terrifying foe who could manipulate Space Law, so he dared not relax.

Meanwhile, Chen Wenhao spread his Divine Sense, searching for Yang Kai's whereabouts.

At that moment, a cry rang out.

In the empty space, Gao Xueting staggered out, followed closely by Yang Kai, brimming with murderous intent like a descending demon god.

"How could you..." Gao Xueting was utterly shocked. She couldn't believe Yang Kai had found her hiding place in the Scorching Sun Domain and ambushed her.

Watching that pitch-black figure rush toward her, a chill of death washed over her; in the blur she seemed to hear the call of the Reaper.

"Sword Dao Without Bounds!" At the critical moment, Chen Wenhao attacked with his sword, unleashing endless sword energy like a storm upon Yang Kai.

Yang Kai roared, Demonic Qi surging, transforming into spirit snakes that clashed with the sword energy.

Hissing sounds filled the air.

Sword energy dissipated, spirit snakes scattered.

Yang Kai's figure appeared. Gao Xueting retreated to Chen Wenhao's side, her face pale, her clothes drenched in sweat.

"Does this guy still have his sanity?" Feng Ming asked in shock, eyes wide.

Just now, Yang Kai had used himself as bait to draw everyone's attention, then silently ambushed Gao Xueting. This was not the behavior of a mindless demon, but a highly intelligent fighter.

Even if he possessed such strength himself, he could not have done it better.

"Perhaps he does, perhaps he does not!" Chen Wenhao sheathed his sword behind his back and stood unmoving like a mountain. Like a blade drawn from its scabbard, he radiated terrifying sword intent and said, "Demonic Master, today you shall witness my Sword Dao!"

As he spoke, killing intent flared and sword energy surged.

Chen Wenhao urged his Origin Qi, displaying exquisite swordsmanship. Each move condensed Sword Intent on his blade, gathering the power of Law, and he suddenly struck.

As he attacked, Gao Xueting vanished into the Scorching Sun Domain again. The nine blazing suns in the sky simultaneously shot beams of light, transforming into nine pillars that descended on Yang Kai, sealing the world.

Feng Ming wielded the Yanlei Spear, unleashing all his skills at Yang Kai's vital points.

For a moment, the three Emperor Realm experts attacked together, determined to slay the demon and defend the human world.

Yang Kai only roared, meeting change with stillness. Demonic clouds rolled over him as he unleashed simple, brutal moves, but he was forced into a disadvantage.

The three wanted to kill him, but it was nearly impossible in a short time.

The demonic clouds on his body possessed formidable defense. Even the combined secret techniques and Imperial Treasures of the three Emperor Realm experts struggled to break through.

Heaven and earth changed color, sun and moon lost their light.

In the Small Xuan Realm, Hua Qingsi remained silent, her beautiful eyes trembling.

To observe the battle of Emperor Realm experts so clearly was a rare opportunity for a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator like her. Unfortunately, the battlefield of Emperor Realm experts was too dangerous for ordinary cultivators to witness.

By chance, she had watched everything from beginning to end.

She no longer wished for Yang Kai's death, but instead fell into deep thought as she watched, as if gaining new insights.

Incarnation glanced at her, smiling without disturbing her.

Turning back to the battlefield, Incarnation's face grew deeply worried.

Although from the surface the situation appeared to be a stalemate, the main body was only a First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator. Even with Demonic Qi, fighting three Emperor Realm experts at once was too much.

The main body kept getting injured, which proved it.

That wasn't the real issue. The real concern was that the main body, knowing it couldn't win, still refused to flee. That was what worried the Incarnation most.

Whether the true body still possessed its own mind, the Incarnation did not know; He tried to contact it, but got no response. Yet earlier, when he secretly told the main body about the flaw in Gao Xueting's Scorching Sun Domain, the main body actually listened.

Otherwise the true body would not have dragged Gao Xueting out from her hiding place and nearly severely injured her.

Suddenly gaining such immense power, especially the evil, violent force of an Ancient Giant Demon, was definitely not a good thing for the main body. If it lasted too long, who knew what might happen.
