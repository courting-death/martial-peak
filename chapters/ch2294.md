## Chapter 2294 — Humiliation

When Du Xian asked this, his expression was strange. He didn’t know why this stranger, Yang Kai, was together with Ye Qinghan, but he didn’t show much hostility. The other disciples of Chiyue Sect were the same, all curiously sizing up Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, cupped his fists, and said, “I am Yang Kai. Greetings, Brother Du.”

Ye Qinghan continued, “Young Master Yang is an honored guest whom I invited. I was originally going to return to the Sect to discuss important matters with my father, but on the way, he assigned me a task here in Tianhe City. I had no choice but to come here first. Senior Brothers and Junior Brothers, please do not neglect him!”

Her tone was serious, making Yang Kai seem like some great figure. Du Xian and Wuma exchanged glances, growing even more puzzled.

Releasing their Divine Sense, they found that Yang Kai was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. His clothes were not particularly fine, clearly not a disciple from any great force. How could someone like this be so highly regarded by Ye Qinghan?

Though they were puzzled, the two didn’t ask more, only nodding slightly.

“Since you’re all here, let’s enter the city. That old man’s concubine ceremony is tomorrow, right?” Ye Qinghan looked at Du Xian and asked, not intending to explain things to her fellow disciples. After all, she had invited Yang Kai back to repair the Space Array, a matter of great importance. The fewer who knew, the better. She hadn’t even had time to report it to Ye Hen yet.

Only then did Du Xian shift his attention from Yang Kai, his expression changing slightly as he said, “Ye'er, mind your words!”

As he spoke, he glanced around. They were just three hundred zhang outside the city gate. If someone from Tianhe City overheard, it could cause trouble.

Ye Qinghan curled her lips. “Calling him an old man is already polite. He’s half-buried in the ground and still dares to take a concubine. Who knows which naive little girl he’s tricked this time.”

Wuma gave a wry smile. “Maybe she wasn’t tricked. Maybe she had no choice. Over the years, this City Lord has taken concubines again and again, but still has no children. Who knows if his body can even handle it… heh heh heh…”

“Serves him right!” Ye Qinghan said, looking quite pleased.

Du Xian rubbed his forehead and said, “Alright, enough. We’re here to offer congratulations, not to cause trouble. Before we left, Master told us not to stir up any trouble in Tianhe City, because all the major forces will be sending people this time.”

Ye Qinghan pouted and said nothing, looking unhappy.

Du Xian smiled at Yang Kai and said, “Please don’t mind us, Brother Yang.”

“It’s nothing,” Yang Kai waved his hand.

“Let’s tidy up and head into the city!” Du Xian called to the others. Only then did everyone straighten their clothes a bit and, under his lead, head toward the city gate.

The congratulatory gifts from Chiyue Sect were all stored in Spatial Rings, so there wasn’t much to prepare. Only those eager to curry favor with Luo Jin would use carriages to carry their gifts, so everyone could see what lavish presents they brought. This not only pleased the City Lord’s Mansion but also brought them prestige.

There were many people at the city gate. The Chiyue Sect group didn’t try to cut in line, quietly forming a row and waiting to enter.

During this time, Ye Qinghan kept apologizing to Yang Kai, afraid he would be displeased.

Others might not know Yang Kai’s abilities, but Ye Qinghan knew them well.

Just ten days ago, the Blood Saber Four Ghosts had been completely wiped out by Yang Kai. The scene was still vivid in her mind. If Yang Kai wanted to force his way into the city, the guards wouldn’t be able to stop him, but it would surely bring disaster to Chiyue Sect.

Fortunately, Yang Kai seemed quite relaxed, showing no sign of impatience.

Du Xian and Wuma grew even more suspicious. They really couldn’t understand why Ye Qinghan treated Yang Kai with such caution, as if she were dealing with an Emperor Realm expert.

The line moved quickly. In less than half a cup of tea’s time, it was Chiyue Sect’s turn.

The martial artist in charge of checking goods and people at the gate saw Ye Qinghan and grinned, cupping his fists. “So it’s Miss Ye from Chiyue Sect. Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner!”

This man’s appearance was unremarkable, looking very ordinary, about forty years old. His clothes were extremely festive, his face full of smiles, but the smile felt very fake.

He was no weakling, having reached the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and seemed to hold an important position in Tianhe City.

Normally, someone of his level wouldn’t be assigned to guard the gate, but today was different. Martial artists from all the major forces were arriving early to congratulate Tianhe City, so the city had to send someone presentable to greet them.

He was just such a person.

Judging by his tone, he clearly knew Ye Qinghan. This wasn’t surprising. According to Ye Qinghan, the City Lord of Tianhe City only held his position thanks to Chiyue Sect’s secret support. So, people from Tianhe City must have had many dealings with Chiyue Sect in the past. As the Sect Master’s daughter, Ye Qinghan was naturally no stranger to them.

Ye Qinghan’s face was cold as ice. She replied indifferently, “Elder Si Ming, you have duties to attend to. No need for courtesy.”

The middle-aged man named Si Ming smiled at her words. “Thank you for your understanding, Miss Ye. It is Tianhe City’s honor that you can attend the City Lord’s concubine ceremony. The City Lord will surely be delighted. Please, Miss Ye!”

As he spoke, he gestured invitingly, making no move to trouble Ye Qinghan.

Ye Qinghan, of course, didn’t stand on ceremony and walked straight into the city.

Just as Du Xian and the others following Ye Qinghan were about to enter, Si Ming suddenly waved his hand, blocking Du Xian and coldly shouted, “What are you doing? Trying to force your way in?”

Du Xian frowned at this, and Ye Qinghan, who was walking ahead, stopped and turned back.

Si Ming shouted, “You’re quite bold, aren’t you? Trying to enter the city without this Lord’s permission? Are you looking down on Tianhe City?”

Du Xian’s face darkened. He said in a deep voice, “Elder Si Ming, are you blind with age or truly can’t see? Don’t you see we’re with the Young Sect Master?”

“You dare insult me?” Si Ming’s face turned red with anger. “Do you believe I won’t arrest you right now?”

Du Xian narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Elder Si Ming… what is the meaning of this?”

Si Ming snorted, “You tell me.”

Du Xian took a deep breath to calm his anger. “We are here on our Master’s orders to congratulate City Lord Luo. Why are you blocking us at the gate and making us a laughingstock?”

“You’re here to congratulate as well?” Si Ming looked surprised, sizing up Du Xian and sneering, “Dressed so shabbily, which Sect are you from?”

“You… Old man, don’t push your luck!” Wuma was instantly enraged. Anyone with eyes could see they were with Ye Qinghan and clearly disciples of Chiyue Sect, but Si Ming pretended not to know them, blocking them and mocking them with veiled insults.

Clearly, he wanted to embarrass Chiyue Sect.

The martial artists waiting in line behind saw this and began whispering among themselves.

The murmurs reached the ears of the Chiyue Sect group, making their faces turn ashen with anger.

They were only here to offer congratulations, yet suffered such humiliation at the city gate. Anyone would find it hard to swallow. Several Chiyue Sect disciples’ Origin Qi surged, as if ready to fight right there.

Si Ming immediately jumped back, wary. “What are you trying to do? Rebel? This is Tianhe City, not your backwater. Where did you bumpkins come from, daring to act up here!”

He made a big show of shouting and posturing, acting as if he were carrying out some grand duty. The martial artists waiting behind couldn’t help but snicker quietly, all understanding that this old fox was just feigning ignorance to publicly embarrass Chiyue Sect. Yet, Chiyue Sect had no way to retaliate.

“Elder Si Ming!” Ye Qinghan glared at him coldly. “Elder Si Ming can’t be that forgetful, can he? You can’t even recognize Chiyue Sect’s insignia? Do you need my father to come explain it to you personally?”

Si Ming looked stunned, staring at Ye Qinghan. “Miss Ye, you mean…?”

He turned to look at Du Xian and the others, finally noticing the Chiyue insignia on their clothes. He slapped his forehead and laughed awkwardly, “Ah, Miss Ye, forgive me, forgive me. This Lord really didn’t notice. So these are all Chiyue Sect’s outstanding talents. Seeing how they looked, I thought they were from some… ahem…”

He put on an act, as if suddenly realizing, and apologized profusely, as if he had only just realized Du Xian and the others were Chiyue Sect disciples.

“Hmph!” Ye Qinghan was truly furious, her pretty face turning red and green, but she had no way to vent her anger, nearly spitting blood from frustration.

“Since you’re all Chiyue Sect’s talents, just register and you can enter. It was this Lord’s oversight, please don’t take offense.” Si Ming’s face was all smiles as he cupped his fists to Du Xian and the others.

“Register? Register what?” Ye Qinghan was taken aback.

Si Ming smiled slyly, “Name, Sect affiliation, just some simple things. Miss Ye, you know, tomorrow is the City Lord’s grand concubine ceremony, a very important event. So these days, not just anyone can enter the city. Everyone must register for inspection.”

Ye Qinghan said coldly, “How come I didn’t see those people before registering?”

Si Ming replied, “Miss Ye, I know all those people, I know where they’re from, so they don’t need to register.”

“So you’re saying you don’t recognize Chiyue Sect’s people?” Ye Qinghan bit her lip, her face angry. Si Ming had made things difficult for Chiyue Sect again and again, making her furious. She hadn’t wanted to come to Tianhe City for this concubine ceremony in the first place, and now she disliked it even more.

What made her even angrier was that Si Ming was clearly humiliating Chiyue Sect in front of so many people.
