## Chapter 595 — Power of the Void

"Where do you think you're running?" Yang Kai's face twisted with murderous intent. His body shifted, surging his speed to the utmost as he blocked the entrance to the Void Passage, his gaze ice-cold as he looked at Yang Bai. His True Yuan erupted fiercely.

"Get lost!" Yang Bai roared fiercely, raising a palm and striking at Yang Kai’s chest. The force in his palm churned like the heart of a spirit snake, dangerous beyond measure.

Boom—Yang Kai’s body shook, a trace of fresh blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. Yang Bai staggered back several steps as well.

"Hahaha!" Yang Kai burst into loud laughter, shouting, "Senior Uncle, you only have the Transcendent First Stage cultivation left now. Let's see how you plan to escape!"

As he spoke, a massive force of Divine Sense rushed out. The little sword within his Sea of Consciousness, guided by his Divine Sense, emitted a chilling coldness as it surged toward Yang Bai.

Yang Bai was shocked and dared not resist, hastily retreating.

The Di Mo cackled wildly, transforming into a streak of bloodlight, wildly attacking Yang Bai from beside him.

The old family heads of the Eight Great Families, having regained their senses, also joined in, contributing their power.

In an instant, Yang Bai was utterly overwhelmed, struggling to cope.

Being restrained by the Locking Demon Chain had already suppressed most of his cultivation. He could now only perform at the Transcendent First Stage level and was simply no match for Yang Kai and his group.

Every time he tried to escape into the Void Passage, he was stopped.

Yang Bai’s face contorted with fury and desperation. Ever since receiving the inheritance and partial memories from the Demonic Master under Dragon Confinement Ravine, he had longed for a higher realm, to conquer the entire Cangyun Evil Land, and invade Yao Wang Valley. That ambition was merely a prelude to his war with the Eight Great Families.

He had schemed for so long, and now that he was about to realize his wishes, the Locking Demon Chain had ruined everything, driving him into madness and urgency.

Yet, with a foundation of Transcendent Third Stage, even in dire straits, Yang Bai was far from defeated. He unleashed a variety of inscrutable divine skills with astonishing power.

Yang Kai’s heart sank. He no longer collided head-on with him but simply wielded the little sword, coldly watching the desperate struggle of this trapped beast.

Suddenly, an overwhelmingly strong aura rapidly approached from not far away. Yang Kai’s expression brightened as he turned to look.

Sure enough, Meng Wuya’s figure slowly appeared. Shopkeeper Meng’s face was full of joy and excitement, his aura far beyond before; even stronger than when he had lifted his sealing in the past.

Behind him, Su Yan and Xia Ningshang quickly manifested their presence.

Clearly, the sealing within Meng Wuya had been lifted, and he had truly restored his Transcendent Realm cultivation, Yang Kai reckoned that he was likely among the top-tier of Transcendent Third Stage masters.

This was only a feeling, but Yang Kai firmly believed it.

Meng Wuya wasted no words upon arrival. He clenched his fist, and an invisible force as heavy as a mountain suddenly pressed down upon Yang Bai, making it difficult for him to move.

Seizing the opportunity, the Di Mo and the old family heads of the Eight Great Families unleashed their killing moves. In an instant, Yang Bai’s body was riddled with wounds, blood flowing profusely.

"Impossible!" Yang Bai stared blankly at the suddenly appearing Meng Wuya, unable to believe that this person could possess cultivation and strength close to his peak.

"Senior Uncle, your last day has come," Yang Kai said coldly.

Yang Bai’s face turned ashen. Deep within his eyes flickered a fierce madness. Trapped with no escape, he laughed loudly: "Ignorant fools! Even if I die, none of you shall live well!"

As he spoke, his True Yuan and aura suddenly became incredibly dangerous. His body swelled and became bloated to an extreme degree. Yang Bai’s face flushed red, blood dripping from all seven orifices.

A chilling, unsettling sensation quickly spread through the air.

Meng Wuya’s expression turned cold and fierce, shouting, "Stop him! He’s about to explode the True Yuan inside his body!"

Yang Kai’s face changed drastically. The Mystery-Grade Divine Soul Treasure—the little sword—thundered fiercely into Yang Bai’s mind, but surprisingly, Yang Bai’s Divine Sense power was incredibly resilient. The sword failed to break through his Sea of Consciousness defenses at the first strike.

Meng Wuya twisted his hand, and an invisible force in the air spun Yang Bai’s head half a circle.

Yang Bai’s laughter froze in his throat. The light in his eyes quickly faded, but his rampaging True Yuan still fiercely erupted.

Boom—

The old family heads of the Eight Great Families surrounding Yang Bai were all blasted back, coughing up blood. The Di Mo howled in pain and somersaulted several times in midair before falling headfirst into the Void Passage and vanishing.

The next moment, the vast energy within the Zhongdu Earth Vein seemed to trigger a chain reaction, erupting from where Yang Bai exploded his True Yuan and bursting deeper and deeper.

At the same time, a strange, eerie force swept over.

Meng Wuya was stunned. Quickly glancing around, his eyes locked on the opened Void Passage. He shouted in disbelief, "How can there be a Void Passage here?!"

Even the great Meng Wuya seemed to see something terrifying and was momentarily stunned.

Momentarily dazed, he hurriedly retreated, arriving with lightning speed beside Su Yan and Xia Ningshang. One hand lifted each of them, and he released a surge of True Yuan to shield them, shouting, "Yang Kai, come with me!"

Before his words ended, his figure vanished into the Void Passage.

Though Yang Kai did not know why Shopkeeper Meng was so alarmed, he understood the situation was dire.

Yang Bai’s True Yuan explosion had caused an abnormal change in Zhongdu’s Earth Vein. Such a mutation was a catastrophic disaster that even Meng Wuya might not withstand.

Now, the only way to survive was to enter the Void Passage and escape to the other side.

At Meng Wuya’s call, Yang Kai did not hesitate. He sped after them, saying, "All eight elders, come here."

His voice barely fell when he entered the Void Passage.

At this moment, the pitch-black and deep Void Passage seemed to collapse. Countless cracks tore through it in every direction, accompanied by constant cracking sounds.

That mysterious, eerie power surged against them.

Yang Kai recalled how terrifying the power of a ruined Void Passage was, remembering when he fled through a Void Passage under Dragon Confinement Ravine. Back then, many Divine Roaming Realm masters from the Qiu Family and Ziwei Valley had met misfortune, their bodies cleaved in two by the erupting void power.

One half was sent into the Cangyun Evil Land, the other half vanished without a trace. The scene was horrifying and vivid.

This kind of Void Power was beyond any human’s endurance.

Now, this Void Passage before him was about to collapse under the impact of the Earth Vein energy.

Yang Kai’s face turned grim. He quickly summoned the Bone Shield, guarding in front of him, furiously infusing True Yuan into it.

A frantic mental message came from ahead—Meng Wuya’s voice. But when Yang Kai scanned the surroundings, no sign of him appeared.

A dazzling light assaulted him, glaring so fiercely that he could barely open his eyes. The Bone Shield bore immense cutting and crashing forces, pushing him step by step backward.

Accompanied by sharp pain and dizziness, Yang Kai’s consciousness rapidly blurred.

...

Half a year had passed since the great defeat in Cangyun Evil Land, when the Four Great Evil Kings were slain and the Evil Lord Yang Bai disappeared.

In these six months, Zhongdu had been left in ruins.

No one knew what changes had occurred beneath the city during that battle, but Zhongdu had sunk dozens of zhang. From a distance, the grand city now appeared as if nestled in a valley.

Countless houses had collapsed, and casualties were beyond reckoning.

Only Yang Kai’s mansion, under the protection of Heavenly Journey Palace, remained undamaged.

The old family heads of the Eight Great Families had also vanished, and no one knew where they had gone. Everyone knew that their chances of survival were slim.

What grieved the Eight Great Families most was that Yang Kai himself had disappeared.

This rising star of Zhongdu had shone with extraordinary brilliance since the Succession War began, repeatedly achieving unthinkable miracles. He led his mansion’s allies to fiercely battle other Yang Family heirs and resist the Eight Great Families, ultimately guiding the latter in repelling the Cangyun Evil Land incursion.

Although only in his twenties, he had already become a legendary figure.

The Yang Family’s acting family head was missing, and the large Yang Family was currently run by the young second family head, Yang Zhao, who along with seven other young family heads managed Zhongdu’s reconstruction.

Rebuilding such a vast city would take no less than a decade.

The only slight comfort was that since the battle, Zhongdu had become rich in Spiritual Qi, making it an ideal place for cultivation. Thus, countless disciples from sects and noble families flocked to Zhongdu to aid reconstruction and cultivate themselves.

In the ruins, Qiu Yimeng stood alone, her eyes sorrowful.

Behind her appeared Zhongdu’s Eldest Young Master Huo.

Huo Xingchen seemed more mature now, standing shoulder to shoulder with Qiu Yimeng. After a moment, he said, "Good people don’t live long, but calamities last a thousand years. Don’t worry too much. Young Master Kai must be hiding somewhere, secretly watching over this place."

Qiu Yimeng murmured, "Is that so? Then why hasn’t he shown himself? It’s already been half a year."

Huo Xingchen was silent.

If Yang Kai was truly safe, he should have appeared long ago. But half a year had passed, and no one knew his whereabouts.

Not only was Yang Kai missing, but the mysterious strongman of the mansion, Meng Wuya, along with Su Yan, Xia Ningshang from Lingxiao Pavilion, and even the Di Mo—all had vanished without a trace.

It was as if they had all agreed to disappear together during that great turmoil.

Qiu Yimeng could find no one to question.

"Huo Xingchen, do you think he’s dead?" Tears shimmered in Qiu Yimeng’s beautiful eyes as she bit her lip.

"Young Master Kai die?" Huo Xingchen laughed heartily. "If Young Master Kai could die, then everyone under heaven might as well be dead. Don’t worry about him. Just keep yourself well-fed and healthy. When he returns one day, you can feed him yourself, right?"

"Shameless!" Qiu Yimeng shot him a fierce glare.

Huo Xingchen chuckled again and looked at the ruins before them. The Eldest Young Master’s eyes grew somewhat uncertain.

Young Master Kai, oh Young Master Kai, where exactly are you? If you’re dead, fine. Then everyone will give up looking for you. But if you’re alive, hurry and shout out. Many people are worried.

A wetness gleamed in the corner of Eldest Young Master Huo’s eye, and somehow his spirits dimmed.
