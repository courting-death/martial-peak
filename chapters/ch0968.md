## Chapter 968 — Lead the Charge

The sky was dim, the earth groaned; it was as if the end of days had come.

Experts from the three races streaked past over a vast city. Countless divine senses spread out and, detecting no trace of living breath within that enormous city, chills ran through their hearts.

This was already the tenth dead city they had seen, and more.

These cities had once teemed with people and clamored with life, yet now they lay as broken walls and ruined ramparts, their streets stained with coagulated darkness and blood, the bodies and bones of the dead nowhere to be found.

They had left the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and traveled for over a month without respite. A few days ago, as they drew near the Water Divine Hall, the three races' experts realized the situation was far worse than they had imagined.

The Bone Race's expansion had been rapid. Centered on the Water Divine Hall, tens of thousands of miles were now empty and desolate; even the common birds that once populated the skies were gone.

That entire radius had become a dead domain, bereft of any living creature.

On the human side alone, at least a hundred thousand people had vanished!

No one could accurately calculate how many new Bone Race members those hundreds of thousands of bones had produced.

A streak of azure light passed ahead, and Yang Kai's figure appeared, his expression grave.

"What's the situation?" Chu Lingxiao hurried forward to ask.

Because Yang Kai possessed the Star Shuttle, he had gone ahead several days earlier to scout and only returned today.

"Not good!" Yang Kai shook his head and glanced back at the many experts racing up behind him. "The Bone Race now has at least three thousand members; not a single one is below the Transcendent Realm."

At that pronouncement, every face paled.

When Yang Kai had last seen the Bone Race, they numbered only a few dozen in the Saint Realm and a little over a hundred in the Transcendent Realm — barely two hundred in total.

Yet in only half a year their numbers had swelled to more than three thousand.

Such frenzied growth was almost impossible to accept.

And those three thousand were all experts above the Transcendent Realm!

That force could already sweep across the world.

"We only number a little over a thousand; they outnumber us by three times," Chu Lingxiao cried out in alarm. Even a world-wise man like him showed pallor in that moment.

Changyuan and Lei Long and the others also grasped the gravity of the situation.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "There are bad points, but also some good ones. Though their numbers are many, the number of Saint Realm masters among those Transcendent Realm experts hasn't risen much. I estimate only about twenty more than when I last saw them half a year ago. We have two hundred Saint Realm members — in that regard they are inferior to us."

"But the remaining Transcendent Realm experts are a huge problem," Meng Wuya frowned.

Yang Kai grinned. "Leave those Transcendent Realm experts to me."

Everyone stared at him in astonishment, wondering what gave him such confidence.

Even Meng Wuya and Chu Lingxiao dared not claim they could handle two or three thousand Transcendent Realm experts, much less proclaim Yang Kai capable of it.

"We should be grateful we assembled in less than half a year. If we had given the Bone Race another year, then truly no one could stop them," Yang Kai said, his face full of lingering fear. The Bone Race's development speed had been terrifying.

With the three races united this time they should be able to crush the Bone Race. If the Bone Race were given another year, or even half a year, the outcome would be uncertain.

"All of their people are concentrated on several islands of the Water Divine Hall, only five hundred li from here. We've traveled so far — rest and recover for a while. We'll set out again in two days," Yang Kai shouted.

No one objected. They were about to reach the Water Divine Hall and a great battle was imminent; naturally everyone wanted to be at their peak. Such large-scale melees could easily cause grievous injury or death if one was careless.

The many experts descended to the ground and each found a place to sit and recover.

Around the Water Divine Hall the islands were shrouded in a thick blood-cloud, a deep, lurid crimson. Even the surrounding sea seemed affected; the once blue waves had turned as red as if infused with fresh blood.

On the central island a colossal blood pool boiled as if brought to a boil, constantly churning and frothed with bubbles.

Many pale bones and countless medicinal ingredients floated and sank in that blood, a scene Yang Kai had seen here before.

Only this time the pool was much larger than when Yang Kai had last seen it, occupying nearly half the island and of unknown depth.

Beside the blood pool gathered many Bone Race members, those of the Bone Race pouring their life essences into the pool to assist the birth of new race members.

Countless ghastly faces, like trapped shades, were bound within the blood pool, writhing and roaring, filling the island with an oppressive aura of death and the howls of the damned.

Ke Luo sat at the island's highest point, overlooking the pool with a satisfied expression.

Suddenly a Bone Race messenger rushed over and reported anxiously, "My lord, the experts from this continent all seem to have been drawn here. They are now camped not far from this place."

Ke Luo's ghost-fire eyes flickered and he sneered, "Finally they come? But it's already too late!"

Rising from his seat, he continued, "The beings of this continent are truly foolish to give my race half a year's preparation. Without that buffer even our revival could not have become so great. But now things are different. If they dare come, we will make them pay — we will make them our companions!"

His voice brimmed with arrogant confidence. The reporting Bone Race member listened, blood aflame with excitement, as if already envisioning their race dominating the continent and enslaving all living things.

"Spread the order: stop pouring life essence into the blood pool. Let the newly born ones draw from the pool's energy to form their flesh quickly!"

"Yes!" The Bone Race member immediately withdrew and hurried to deliver the command beside the pool.

Moments later, those around the blood pool ceased their work; all began to draw energy from the pool.

Skeletal frames that had lacked flesh soon gained their own bodies in a short time.

Those of the Bone Race who already had flesh grew even stronger after absorbing the blood pool's essence.

The Bone Race was prepared to go all out.

As wind and alarm cried out, the blood-clouds above the Water Divine Hall slowly vanished, their contained energy entirely absorbed by the Bone Race and turned into their power.

Two days passed in a blink.

Over the sea, the human, yao, and demon experts — more than a thousand strong — surged toward the Water Divine Hall.

Standing on those islands, the Bone Race beings watched without fear. Their green eyes gleamed with ferocity and malice as they stared at the approaching three races' experts, as if gazing upon delectable prey.

Many Bone Race members licked their lips in impatient anticipation.

About ten li from the island Yang Kai halted, and the human, yao, and demon experts behind him also froze.

Countless curious gazes looked their way.

Almost none of those present had ever seen the Bone Race in person; only now did they witness them with their own eyes.

They were no different from humans in flesh and blood; the only distinction was their eerie green eyes, and the bloodthirsty, frenzied aura emanating from their bodies left people extremely uneasy.

"So this is the Bone Race?" many whispered in disbelief.

"Not so fearsome after all — I thought they'd have three heads and six arms. Turns out they have one head and two arms!"

"Hahaha! We'll teach these trash a lesson soon enough!"

The crowd jeered, seemingly not taking the Bone Race seriously at all.

"Yang Kai, what will you do? Say the word — we'll follow your command now," Changyuan said, glaring ahead as Demon Yuan stirred within him and a dangerous aura began to leak from his body.

That was the same race that had once battled the Great Demon God. After thousands of years, the Demon Lord Changyuan felt compelled to set things right and clean up the mess left by that long-ago struggle, not wishing to sully the demon god's name.

"I'll go and lead the charge; you all hold back for now," Yang Kai said calmly.

"You?" Changyuan turned to him in astonishment, and Lei Long and many of the human experts also looked at him oddly.

Changyuan slowly shook his head. "Don't think I look down on you. If you rush up with that level of strength, you'll die for sure."

"Indeed, Little Yang Kai, and besides, you're the one giving orders for the three races — you shouldn't be the one leading the vanguard," Meng Wuya said anxiously. "Let me go instead."

He feared Yang Kai might come to harm.

“No need. Since I’ve decided to go, I naturally have my reasons. Just watch,” Yang Kai said with a confident smile.  

Saying that, he produced the Star Shuttle; with a flash of azure light he was already in the sky above the Water Divine Hall.

Below, countless Bone Race creatures gazes fixed on him. Ke Luo snorted coldly and bellowed, "It's you!"

He remembered Yang Kai's face; last time Yang Kai had tricked him and Ke Luo had burned with rage, secretly vowing that if he could find Yang Kai in the future he would crush him to dust.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai had come alone and delivered himself into their hands.

Overjoyed, Ke Luo waved his hand and shouted, "Seize him! I want the Star Shuttle!"

Immediately a Bone Race warrior at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm shot forward. Even before he arrived, the ferocious killing intent emanating from him solidified into the shape of a savage giant beast that lunged at Yang Kai with gaping jaws.

That primeval beast was enormous, a type none present had seen before; its towering murderous aura seemed capable of devouring heaven and earth.

A trail of azure light flickered as Yang Kai piloted the Star Shuttle to effortlessly evade. He weaved through the sky above the Water Divine Hall as his great divine sense spread like a tide, seeping into every corner of the island and covering each Bone Race member.

Ke Luo's eyes narrowed and he sneered, "Divine Sense attack?"

As he spoke, a divine sense equal to Yang Kai's was unleashed and, following the source of Yang Kai's awareness, like an invisible blade it stabbed fiercely into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai's form faltered, freezing in midair.

"Seeking death! Dare to flaunt a Divine Sense attack before me — do you even know your own strength?" Ke Luo sneered without end.
