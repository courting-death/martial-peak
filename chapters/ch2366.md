## Chapter 2366 — Sea Vessel

"How could this happen?" Liu Qianyun exclaimed in shock.

"I don't know!" Yang Kai was just as confused, shaking his head. "There's something off about this secret realm!"

In all his years of cultivation, he had never encountered Spiritual Qi that couldn't be absorbed. The Spiritual Qi in this Jixu Secret Realm was mixed with something indescribable. The more one absorbed, the greater the damage to a cultivator's foundation. If it continued, it would surely shatter the meridians and cause one to lose all cultivation.

Fortunately, Yang Kai stopped after cultivating for only half an hour.

"Then what do we do?" Liu Qianyun was completely panicked. If the Spiritual Qi here couldn't be absorbed, she and Yang Kai would eventually be exhausted. Forget about finding a way out—there was a real chance they wouldn't even escape this vast sea, and in the end, would simply die from exhaustion.

It was like a table full of delicacies placed before a starving person—beautiful to look at, but laced with deadly poison. Eat and die, don't eat and starve...

"No worries, I have a way." Yang Kai remained calm, directly taking out the Xuan Realm Pearl and handing it to Liu Qianyun. "Hold onto this. I'll go inside to recover."

As he spoke, he slipped into the Small Xuan Realm.

Liu Qianyun hadn't even had time to say much before Yang Kai disappeared. She stared blankly at the Xuan Realm Pearl in her hand. Recalling her previous residence—the peaceful world she had left—she suddenly realized something, and her pretty face changed in shock.

After a moment, she hurriedly put away the Xuan Realm Pearl, hiding it carefully, then focused on steering the wooden boat, dodging the waterspouts and pressing forward.

An hour later, Yang Kai reappeared, no longer as weak as before. His complexion was rosy; he had clearly fully recovered.

Liu Qianyun didn't say much, simply nodded to him and handed the Xuan Realm Pearl back.

Having cultivated to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm in the Great Wilderness Star Domain and earned a reputation as a local overlord, Liu Qianyun was clearly a clever person. She naturally knew what to ask and what not to ask.

Yang Kai entrusting her with the Xuan Realm Pearl was a sign of deep trust. As for its mysteries, she was content to know only what she needed.

Days passed one after another.

Every two or three days, Yang Kai would enter the Small Xuan Realm to recover, then return to steer the wooden boat onward.

During this time, Liu Qianyun also ran out of Origin Qi twice and entered the Small Xuan Realm to recover. She was obedient, coming and going without ever asking questions.

In the blink of an eye, a month passed. Yet Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun remained adrift on the sea, with no sign of land. The ocean truly seemed endless.

No matter how steadfast Yang Kai was, he couldn't help but grow impatient.

One day, as Yang Kai returned from the Small Xuan Realm, Liu Qianyun called out in delight, "Senior Brother, I think we've found something!"

"What is it?" Yang Kai perked up and asked eagerly.

Liu Qianyun pointed ahead. "Look, the density of the waterspouts has decreased a lot, and the farther we go, the fewer there are."

Yang Kai looked closely and saw it was true. The number of waterspouts on the sea had dropped significantly, and this discovery made his eyes light up.

Though there was still no sign of land, at least the scenery around them was finally changing.

Yang Kai had been wondering if he was lost or just circling the same area. Now it seemed he wasn't lost at all—the sea was simply vast beyond measure.

This realization made both Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun more determined, urging the wooden boat forward with renewed effort.

As time passed, the waterspouts grew fewer and fewer, eventually disappearing altogether. This convinced Yang Kai that he was heading in the right direction, and if they kept going, they might find something unexpected.

Three days later, as Yang Kai was steering the boat, he suddenly sensed something and looked into the distance. His face lit up with joy as he patted Liu Qianyun's shoulder. "Junior Sister, there's a ship!"

Liu Qianyun had been resting with her eyes closed. In this strange place, she didn't dare meditate, so Yang Kai's words startled her awake. She stood up and looked in the direction he pointed, and sure enough, saw a tiny black dot far away.

That tiny black dot was, in fact, a large ship.

Liu Qianyun couldn't help but get excited, glancing at Yang Kai and seeing he was just as delighted.

After more than a month in this strange place, drifting on the sea, finally seeing a ship was a joy beyond words.

A ship meant people, and people meant they could ask about this place and where to go next.

Yang Kai quickly sped up the wooden boat, heading straight for the large ship.

As they drew closer, the ship's appearance became clearer.

It was a massive multi-deck vessel—in fact, a Secret Treasure. Yang Kai was shocked—crafting such a ship would require immense effort and resources. He wondered how the cultivators living in this strange place managed it.

As the wooden boat approached, the sentries on the ship noticed them. Before Yang Kai could get close, more than a dozen people appeared on the deck, standing scattered and watching curiously, pointing and whispering among themselves.

Soon, Yang Kai was not far from the ship. Looking over, he saw that regardless of gender, every one of those dozen people radiated a fierce aura, watching him with wary eyes.

What surprised Yang Kai even more was that most of them were Dao Origin Realm cultivators!

How did they maintain their cultivation in this strange place? After all, the Spiritual Qi here couldn't be absorbed, and living here long-term should cause one's cultivation to regress.

Though each of them looked a bit lacking in vitality—clearly from not being able to cultivate properly—they had nevertheless maintained their realms.

The leader among them was a woman with a voluptuous figure, curves in all the right places. Perhaps from years spent here, her skin was a bit dark, but it didn't detract from her beauty—if anything, it added a wild charm.

She stood there like a lithe leopard, her gaze razor-sharp.

Yang Kai didn't rush aboard, but cupped his fists and called out, "Greetings, friends. May I ask where you are headed? Could you take us along?"

The group remained unmoved, but the leading woman raised her chin slightly and said coolly, "Where did you come from?"

Yang Kai casually pointed in a direction. "We came from over there. Our ship met with disaster, and only the two of us escaped."

Of course, this was nonsense. As newcomers, Yang Kai didn't want to reveal his background.

"A disaster?" The woman's expression changed slightly, but she didn't press for details. She sighed, as if shipwrecks were common here, then nodded. "You two are lucky to have survived. I can let you aboard, but you know the rules, right?"

Rules... Yang Kai's heart skipped a beat. After a month here, these were the first people he'd met—how could he know the rules?

Just as he was about to ask, the woman frowned and said, "Five thousand Source Crystals per person. For two, that's ten thousand."

"That's fine!" Yang Kai nodded quickly, thinking the rule was just buying a ticket.

It was acceptable, but what surprised Yang Kai was how cheap the fare was—only five thousand Source Crystals per person.

As he spoke, he reached for his Spatial Ring to take out the Source Crystals.

The woman saw his movement and frowned. "You're not planning to give me Source Crystals here, are you?"

Yang Kai looked at her in confusion. "Is there a problem?"

The woman's expression immediately turned odd, staring at Yang Kai intently. Not just her—the other cultivators on deck all looked at him with amused expressions.

What's going on? Yang Kai frowned, puzzled. Was giving her Source Crystals here somehow wrong? Was he exposing a flaw?

As Yang Kai wondered, the woman took out a restriction token and waved it forward. The protective barrier over the ship split open, and she said calmly, "Come in."

"Thank you!" Yang Kai suppressed his doubts and guided the wooden boat inside.

Stepping onto the deck, both Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. The feeling of solid ground was wonderful.

"Follow me," the woman beckoned, leading the way.

Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun exchanged a glance and hurried after her.

The cultivators on deck parted, letting them pass freely.

After a short walk, the woman suddenly asked, "How long have you been shipwrecked on the Jixu Sea?"

So this was called the Jixu Sea. Yang Kai made a mental note. As for her question, he answered without hesitation, "It happened just yesterday. If not for meeting you, the consequences would have been dire. Thank you for taking us in, Miss."

His aura was steady, showing he hadn't used much Origin Qi, so claiming the shipwreck happened yesterday was the best explanation.

"Is that so?" The woman's lips curled into a meaningful smile.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, wondering if this woman had somehow seen through him. But he was sure he hadn’t given anything away. He exchanged a glance with Liu Qianyun, both of them equally baffled.

As they spoke, the woman led Yang Kai to a cabin, opened the door, and went inside.

Yang Kai looked around. Though not large, the cabin was quiet and pleasant, and seemed to be reinforced by some kind of formation—he wondered what it was for.

"Are we going to live here from now on?" Yang Kai asked.

The woman glanced at him and said coolly, "You're overthinking it."

Yang Kai's face darkened. This woman was truly strange. If they weren't going to stay, why bring them here?
