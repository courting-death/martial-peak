## Chapter 2237 — The Great Emperor

Outside the royal palace, on the plains, Gao Xueting, at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, faced Granny You, at the Third Stage, yet remained completely unafraid.

She brushed a lock of hair behind her ear and said calmly, "Granny, how about we end things here?"

Granny You was momentarily stunned by these words, but quickly burst into loud laughter and shouted, "Little girl, who do you think you’re talking to?"

"Of course, I’m talking to you, Granny." Gao Xueting remained unmoved, her expression still cold. "If you agree to end things here, perhaps Hall Master might show some leniency and not make things difficult for you. But if you insist on going your own way... Granny, we’ve known each other for hundreds of years. Though you’re not of my temple, there’s still some sentiment between us. There are some things I really don’t want to do."

"You’re threatening me?" Granny You’s face darkened, her voice turning sharp.

Gao Xueting shook her head and said, "Granny, you’re a senior. Xueting wouldn’t dare threaten you. I’m only following Hall Master’s orders, leading a few disciples to train in this Divine Roaming Mirror, and I must ensure their safety. No one can harm them, not even you, Granny!"

Granny You burst into laughter, her voice echoing across the plains. "Heh heh heh... Little girl, your strength may be lacking, but your tone is anything but modest. Do you really think you have what it takes to deal with me? If not for the fact that you’ve behaved yourself over the years, do you think I’d bother speaking to you so nicely?"

"Granny, do you still remember when I was little, sneaking food to you?" Gao Xueting suddenly brought up the past.

Granny You’s face turned cold, her voice icy. "Why bring that up?"

A trace of reminiscence flashed across her eyes involuntarily, and her violent expression softened slightly for a moment.

"Xueting truly hopes Granny can let this go!" Gao Xueting sighed softly.

"Impossible!" The coldness returned to Granny You’s eyes as she said, "I’ve waited so many years and finally have a sliver of hope. You think a few words from you can make me give up? Ridiculous."

Gao Xueting frowned and said, "I don’t know what you’re waiting for, Granny, or what you’re hoping for. But... must you really do this? It’s been eight hundred years. Though you never joined the temple, I’ve long regarded you as one of us, as my elder. I really... don’t want to fight you!"

"Enough nonsense." Granny You lost her patience and shouted, "Either get out of my way now, or I’ll kill you myself. Choose your path."

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but grow tense.

Although Gao Xueting was considered an expert, in front of someone like Granny You, Yang Kai figured she definitely wasn’t a match. If Gao Xueting got dragged into this because of him, he’d feel guilty.

"Ah!" Gao Xueting suddenly let out a deep sigh, staring at Granny You. "Granny, Hall Master has long known you’ve held a grudge against him, unable to let go of that battle all those years ago. Yet even so, he still trusted me to lead the team into this Divine Roaming Mirror, not worried you’d seize the opportunity. Do you know why?"

At these words, Granny You’s expression changed slightly, and she frowned in thought.

Gao Xueting continued, "Over the years, many disciples of the temple who entered the Divine Roaming Mirror to train have died because of you. But Hall Master never held you accountable, simply treating it as a test for the disciples. First, because you never acted personally—even when you sent your subordinates, they were only as strong as the disciples, so it was indeed a test for them. Second, Hall Master feels guilty toward you. After all, the Divine Roaming Mirror was discovered by you. Though he never took it by force, he did treat it as the temple’s most precious asset, repeatedly sending disciples here to train."

"Wen Zishan feels guilty toward me?" Granny You suddenly sneered, "That man, with a conscience eaten by dogs, would feel guilty? What a joke!"

Gao Xueting’s expression remained indifferent. "That’s why Hall Master instructed me not to use this method unless absolutely necessary! Because he truly hopes you’ll always be the one guarding the Divine Roaming Mirror."

"What method?" Granny You’s face suddenly grew tense, her eyes fixed on Gao Xueting.

But Gao Xueting didn’t answer. Instead, she quickly formed seals with her hands and said, "Don’t worry, Granny. I’ve already informed Hall Master of everything here through a secret art. He should be waiting in the cave now. When your soul returns, you can discuss everything with him in detail."

As she finished speaking, her hands crossed at an angle, and a ring of light blossomed between them. She gently pushed forward, and the light shot straight at Granny You.

This ball of light clearly had no killing power, nor did it pose any threat, but upon seeing it, Granny You’s face changed dramatically, and she cried out in terror, "No!"

As she spoke, she actually turned and fled, trying to escape.

But no matter how fast she was, the light was even faster. In an instant, it struck her and merged into her soul.

The next moment, a strange vortex appeared above Granny You’s head, swirling and emitting a powerful suction force, trying to pull her in.

Naturally, Granny You was unwilling to sit and wait for death. In her fury, she let out a hysterical roar, and a surge of pure soul energy shot straight at Gao Xueting.

Gao Xueting’s face changed dramatically.

This desperate strike from Granny You was clearly her full power unleashed, something Gao Xueting couldn’t possibly withstand. She had no choice but to dodge.

But just as she tried to evade, a drifting figure suddenly appeared in midair. It was an old man, with an immortal air, white hair and beard, his whole presence utterly unremarkable. If he hadn’t revealed himself, no one present would have noticed his existence.

As soon as the old man appeared, he waved his sleeve.

A gentle force spread out, dissolving Granny You’s soul attack into nothingness.

"You..." Granny You’s eyes widened as she stared at the old man, her face full of disbelief, as if she’d seen a ghost in broad daylight.

At that moment, the force from the vortex above her head became irresistible. Amidst her unwilling roar, her body was sucked in. Then, the vortex vanished, and Granny You disappeared without a trace.

Yang Kai watched this scene, his mind racing.

Granny You’s physical body must have been tampered with by Wen Zishan, perhaps branded with some secret art, and he’d taught Gao Xueting how to use it.

Once this secret art was activated, Granny You’s physical body would draw her soul back to itself.

That explained the scene before him: even someone as strong as Granny You at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, once struck by that secret art, could no longer remain in the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror.

Although this was just Yang Kai’s guess, it was probably correct. After all, only the close connection between body and soul could draw Granny You’s soul away—only her own body could do that.

While Yang Kai was speculating, Gao Xueting looked suspiciously at the old man who had suddenly appeared.

She released her Divine Sense, but when it touched the old man, she was shocked to find he didn’t exist at all—in other words, her Divine Sense couldn’t detect any trace of him.

This discovery made Gao Xueting’s expression instantly solemn.

Even with people like Granny You and Wen Zishan, her cultivation allowed her to sense a little about them with her Divine Sense. But facing this old man was the first time she’d ever encountered such a situation.

There was only one explanation for this—the old man’s cultivation was higher than both Granny You and Wen Zishan!

The latter two were already at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Someone even stronger had a special title in this world—Great Emperor!

In the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, there was actually a Great Emperor!

Wen Zishan had never mentioned such a thing to her. Perhaps even he didn’t know.

Gao Xueting bowed respectfully and said, "Junior Gao Xueting greets Senior!"

"Mm!" The old man nodded slightly.

"Senior... are you perhaps allied with Granny?" Gao Xueting asked again.

Yang Kai turned his head to look at Gao Xueting with a strange expression, suddenly realizing that this usually icy Elder Gao actually had such an adorable side.

If the old man was with Granny You, he wouldn’t have helped her just now. He would have subdued her long ago, so why give her a chance to use the secret art?

"No." The old man slowly shook his head.

"Junior thanks Senior for saving my life just now, but may I ask..." Gao Xueting probed. Although she didn’t sense any hostility from the old man, his extraordinary cultivation made her extremely cautious, afraid of angering him by accident.

If that happened, even if Wen Zishan came in person, he wouldn’t be able to save her.

"I came here..." The old man said, turning his gaze to Yang Kai, "for him!"

"For me?" Yang Kai looked utterly bewildered.

Gao Xueting’s expression also turned somewhat peculiar. She turned to look at Yang Kai, unable to fathom what was so special about him that even a Great Emperor would come here just to meet him.

As far as she knew, this was Yang Kai’s first time entering the Divine Roaming Mirror. He hadn’t even known of its existence before, so it was unlikely they’d met before.

Steadying herself, Gao Xueting asked again, "May I ask, Senior, what do you want with him?"

The old man smiled gently, his expression kindly, and said, "Rest assured, I have no intention of making things difficult for him. I simply wish to take him away for a few days—there are some matters in which I require his assistance. Once that is done, I will see to it that he leaves this place."

Gao Xueting’s brows arched as she looked at him in surprise. “Leave this place… Senior, what do you mean by that?”

The old man’s words about "leaving this place" clearly revealed something unusual.

The old man smiled. "I can glimpse a little of the outside world, and I know you are not people of this place!"

Yang Kai was shocked by these words!

Yi Quan knew this was the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror because Wen Zishan had let it slip while drunk, but this old man had figured it out on his own.

This showed the old man’s strength had truly reached the Great Emperor level. Only with such power could one pierce the world's boundaries, see through illusion, and send Divine Sense to observe the outside world.
