## Chapter 1967 — Am I That Old?

Inside the Starlight Passage, the spatial secret art Yang Kai had used destabilized the corridor, causing Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan to be scattered apart; during that time Yang Kai had been worrying over their safety, but he had no channel to find out where they had gone.

Leaving Xiaoxiao aside, it plainly looked like a puppet, and anyone would take an interest in it; if it exposed itself before outsiders, it would surely be targeted.

However, Xiaoxiao's escape methods were remarkably good—being of the Stone Puppet race, it could naturally travel underground, making it rather difficult for others to seize it.

Liu Yan was different; she did not possess escape means as formidable as Xiaoxiao's, and her existence likewise drew the interest of every martial artist—capturing her and fusing her into one's Secret Treasure would be tantamount to giving that treasure an Artifact Spirit, enough to elevate the treasure's power by an entire tier!

Moreover, some martial artists skilled in fire-based power could even directly devour Liu Yan, assimilating her strength into their own bodies and thereby greatly increasing their power.

Even if she proved useless to them, they could sell her—surely for a good price.

Thus Liu Yan's predicament was far more dangerous than Xiaoxiao's.

At that moment, upon hearing the intelligence provided by the middle-aged man, Yang Kai felt a surge of alarm; if the being on Yuqing Mountain really was Liu Yan, then her present circumstances were dire.

With so many martial artists rushing there, Liu Yan could not cope—being captured was merely a matter of time.

With that thought, Yang Kai hastily executed his movement art and sped after those people.

Thirty thousand li was actually nothing to cultivators of the Void King Realm; in no more than the time it took half an incense stick, Yang Kai had arrived beneath Yuqing Mountain.

Quite a number of martial artists had already gathered there—roughly counted, about two hundred people.

What slightly reassured Yang Kai was that these people's cultivations were not very high—most were of the Origin Returning Realm and the Void King Realm; Dao Origin Realm practitioners were rare.

It seemed that the overall martial standard of Fenglin City was not particularly strong, Yang Kai guessed inwardly.

The martial artists gathered there had no intention of entering the mountains to search; instead they began forming groups of three or five, shouting and organizing teams, apparently intending to rely on numerical advantage to act.

Some of them looked covered in burns and wounds—these injuries were plainly the result of flame—and there were even several corpses on the ground, a gruesome sight, their bodies charred.

“That Fire Bird is truly vicious. Judging from the power fluctuations within it, it's only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, yet the flames it breathes are extremely hard to withstand. Brother Zhao and Brother Zhang were veteran Void King cultivators, but when they confronted it they were burned to death on the spot—fortunately we ran fast, otherwise...”

The man speaking sat beside those corpses, tending to his wounds as he recounted the encounter with the Fire Bird, still trembling with residual fear.

Many gathered around them, inferring the Fire Bird's combat strength from the injuries.

It was precisely because of these men's ordeal and their account that the weaker Void King Realm cultivators abandoned plans to go it alone and instead banded together.

Yang Kai naturally heard these words and felt a thrill in his heart.

The power fluctuations of a Third Stage of the Void King Realm and those terrifying flames matched Liu Yan's characteristics! If Yang Kai had previously doubted whether the Fire Bird on Yuqing Mountain was Liu Yan, now he was more than eighty percent sure.

Liu Yan also emitted power fluctuations of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and because she had devoured so many foreign fires—even continuously absorbing forces like Sun's True Fire—her flames were extraordinarily terrifying; even Yang Kai did not dare to come into contact with them lightly.

“Sirs, so you have seen that Fire Bird?” Yang Kai pushed through the crowd and stepped forward to ask.

“Of course we saw it,” the speaker looked up at Yang Kai and said with a wry smile, “otherwise how would we have returned all battered like this?”

“May I ask what that Fire Bird looked like?”

“Hard to describe—it looked strange. Its tail feathers were extremely long, but its body was not large, only about one zhang or so.”

Yang Kai was stunned by this; if Liu Yan's true form had manifested, it should have been a colossal beast, which did not quite fit Liu Yan's known image.

“So it only has the Fire Bird form? Could it change into something else?” Yang Kai continued to ask.

The man laughed immediately: “What do you want it to change into—some scantily clad, cold-faced, red-haired beauty?”

The onlookers burst into laughter, regarding Yang Kai with strange eyes as if looking at some lecherous fool.

“Thanks.” Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly and withdrew from the crowd.

Although the information he'd extracted from others was not much, it was at least something.

Whether the Fire Bird on Yuqing Mountain truly was Liu Yan would be clear once he went inside. He silently activated the Soul Brand in his Sea of Consciousness and began to sense.

He and Liu Yan had a spiritual link, planted when he had captured her back then; so long as their distance was not too great, activating the Soul Brand would allow them to sense each other.

To his disappointment, he felt no response from Liu Yan.

It seemed he had no choice but to go in and investigate.

Just as he resolved to enter Yuqing Mountain, someone silently approached from behind; Yang Kai frowned, turned, and saw a petite girl—her chest remarkably ample—smiling at him.

The girl should have been a peerless beauty, yet a brown crescent-shaped birthmark marred half her cheek; that ugly mark ruined her being a perfect beauty, causing many men who saw her to first feel a bright spark, then sigh regretfully.

She wore a green long skirt that, though loose, could not conceal her full bosom; several cloth pouches were tied at her waist—what lay inside was unknown, the pouches bulging.

She wore an ingratiating expression and an innocent smile, looking at Yang Kai timidly: “Uncle, could you step aside to speak?”

Yang Kai's face darkened and he snarled, “Who do you call 'uncle'? Am I that old?”

Although by mortal standards Yang Kai's age was not small, at the level of cultivators he was still very young—by appearance he was only a little over twenty.

Being suddenly addressed as 'uncle' by a girl instantly soured Yang Kai's mood.

Seemingly frightened by Yang Kai's fierce look, the girl stepped back several paces, her face full of grievance.

Yang Kai sized her up, his gaze lingering for a moment on her ample chest before his eyelids narrowed: “Third Stage of the Void King Realm?”

He was astonished to find that this girl, who looked only fifteen or sixteen, actually had cultivation not weaker than his own.

However Yang Kai could not be sure of her true age—perhaps this girl was an ancient demoness who had lived for hundreds or thousands of years—and he certainly would not be naive enough to think her look of grievance was genuine.

Putting on a show was everyday fare for such ancient demonesses; their excellent acting could fool even themselves, let alone Yang Kai.

Yet that long-unfamiliar form of address reminded Yang Kai of someone.

Lin Yun'er!

Back in the Lingxiao Sect, that girl would call him "uncle" at every turn, shouting it with unabashed glee — it somehow made Yang Kai feel several years older.

He wondered how that girl was now. When Yang Yan had left she had taken no one— not even Ye Xijun—only Lin Yun'er had been taken, evidently because Yang Yan valued Lin Yun'er's special Force Tyrant Body constitution.

Yang Kai's expression gradually softened. The girl reached out a small hand, patted her chest to steel her courage, and said, “Eldest Brother, could you step aside to speak?”

She was playing the part convincingly! Yang Kai sneered inwardly, outwardly composed as he nodded and said, “What do you want to tell me?”

The girl glanced about nervously, then her red lips moved and she transmitted a line of sound to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned and said in a low voice, “You're not lying to me?”

“I have no grudge against you—why would I lie to you?” the girl said with a wronged look.

“Lead the way ahead.” Yang Kai gestured.

The girl immediately smiled and indeed led the way.

She displayed no guard against Yang Kai at all; whether it was feigned or born of boldness he could not tell.

Yang Kai judged it was the latter.

After walking a short distance they left the crowd; in a secluded spot two others had been waiting, and upon seeing the girl's return both showed looks of delight.

Yang Kai read their expressions and secretly swept them with his Divine Sense, finding both to be Third Stage Void King Realm cultivators. The two were a man and a woman; the man wore a resolute countenance and a kind smile, like a refreshing spring breeze, while the woman was gaudily dressed, her figure seductive, and her almond-shaped eyes seemed imbued with potent enchantment that drew one in—her slightly quivering red lips were all the more alluring.

Men lacking in composure would likely feel tongue-dry after a single glance at her.

Yang Kai put on a momentarily vacant expression at the right time, then quickly returned to normal.

The woman's eyes took in his performance and the corners of her mouth lifted into a slight smile, as if pleased with her own charm.

“Little sister Xiaoqi, did you find someone?” the woman asked with a smile.

The girl nodded and said happily, “This Eldest Brother should do, and he seems very interested in our plan.”

As she spoke, she pointed at Yang Kai.

The man smiled and nodded at Yang Kai, clasped his fists and said, “I am Xu Qing—may I ask how to address my friend?”

“Yang Kai!” Since few people in this Star Realm recognized him, Yang Kai simply did not bother to invent a false name.

“Yu Ruomei greets Brother Yang,” the woman said, offering a graceful curtsey at his side.

Yang Kai hastily returned the bow.

“My name is Mo Xiaoqi,” the girl who had led Yang Kai over introduced herself.

Yang Kai nodded and said, “Miss Xiaoqi, you just said you know where that Fire Bird is— is that true?”
