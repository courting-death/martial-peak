## Chapter 961 — The Broken Ship

As Changyuan walked through the Demon Palace, it wasn't long before he arrived at a side chamber; he strode in without hesitation and the others followed.

Yang Kai cast a glance around and was startled to realize this side chamber appeared to be Changyuan's personal quarters, and the entrance to the secret left behind by the Great Demon God was hidden here.

For countless years only successive Demon Lords had been qualified to contemplate and inspect it, and yet today so many people had come at once.

In the corner of the chamber, Changyuan produced several strands of Demon Yuan, and an extremely concealed portal suddenly yawned open.

Changyuan slipped in without a word; the four Demon Generals surged in after him. Meng Wuya glanced at Yang Kai and whispered, warning him to be careful and to take the lead.

Only then did Yang Kai step forward into the passage.

Li Rong, Han Fei and Di Mo brought up the rear.

A straight corridor slanted downward. Although no light entered, it did not feel dark; many strange stones that emitted a soft, non‑harsh glow were studded along both sides of the passage.

Ahead came muffled whispers — the Four Great Demon Generals speaking quietly among themselves.

Yang Kai noticed many curious things: along the corridor walls countless lively, swirling patterns had been carved; the designs were very abstract, and unless one studied them closely one could not tell what they depicted.

Changyuan's voice came from up ahead: “These patterns are the Great Demon God's major deeds and glorious past events from his life. They may even have been created by the Great Demon God himself; there's probably no great significance to them.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and kept walking and watching; suddenly those odd, formless patterns seemed to come alive in his sight. One clear scene after another swam across his vision, silently recounting the Great Demon God's life.

He even saw scenes of the Great Demon God clashing with the master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land — the Great Demon God wounded, the Sacred Land's master grievously injured, and a drop of Demon God Golden Blood carried away.

He saw another battle with a husband and wife proficient in a Dual Cultivation Technique; the golden dragon and ice phoenix roamed the heavens, and even the couple together could not prevail.

He also saw a pair of hulking twin brothers defeated at the hands of the Great Demon God.

Then he saw the Great Demon God standing proud within an ancient, unmelting glacier; beside him a woman in white stood bloodied from head to foot, staring at him with eyes full of mingled love and hate. After a long while the Great Demon God strode off carefreely; the woman was left sorrowful, tears slipping silently down her face.

A tremendous tremor. Yang Kai immediately realized there was more to these patterns; if one studied them carefully there might be special gains to be had.

That husband and wife proficient in Dual Cultivation Technique must be the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress of Dragon‑Phoenix Palace.

Those twin brothers were surely the two pavilion masters of the Twin Pavilion.

And the woman in white among the ice — if Yang Kai's guess was correct — should be a predecessor of the Ice Sect.

Those three sects were the top sects of that era.

Everyone who had confronted the Great Demon God was among the most formidable experts of their time; yet the Great Demon God had never been defeated — victorious in a hundred battles.

Scene after scene flowed past Yang Kai, giving him a strange sensation as if he were standing at the Great Demon God's vantage point, looking down coldly upon all living things — the higher the place, the colder the view.

In only a few decades the Great Demon God had secured his place as the greatest man of all time; none could surpass him, and after that he became lonely and solitary.

He set out to explore the starry sky in search of higher mysteries and more martial secrets.

Then he vanished without a trace!

Rumors said he had fallen by accident on his journey into the starry sky.

“Saint Lord Yang! Saint Lord Yang!” Changyuan's shout came to his ears and Yang Kai's whole body jolted; he snapped back and saw everyone gazing at him strangely — he realized his mind had inadvertently sunk into those weird patterns.

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked.

Changyuan's face went blank as he stared into Yang Kai's eyes; in those pupils he perceived an air of desolation, as if in an instant Yang Kai had experienced a thousand years rolling by, endowing this young man's face with the weight of age.

Meng Wuya had evidently noticed too and furrowed his brow.

But that sense of desolation quickly faded, almost convincing Changyuan he had imagined it; he forced a smile. “We've arrived. From here on I'll leave it to Saint Lord Yang.”

“Is this it?” Yang Kai peered ahead and found a dead end: a heavy wall blocked the way.

On that wall was a square, perfectly even recess.

All eyes were fixed on him.

Yang Kai understood; with a thought he produced the Demon God's Secret Codex.

Instantly Changyuan and the four Demon Generals' eyes burned with intensity.

“Don't get any funny ideas — if you start a fight here none of you will come out of it well!” Meng Wuya sneered.

The space was too cramped; if so many Saint‑Realm experts fought here, the only outcome would be mutual destruction.

Changyuan forced a laugh. “Brother Meng, you're too cautious. I have no intention of stealing anyone's treasure.”

“You never know — that is the Demon God's Secret Codex, who can tell what you're thinking?” Meng Wuya snorted and edged closer to Yang Kai, indicating, “You make the move, I'll watch them.”

Yang Kai nodded and slowly pressed the Demon God's Secret Codex into the recess.

In the silent corridor everyone's breath caught and their gazes clung to the Demon God's Secret Codex like leeches, expectant and excited.

As the distance closed Yang Kai felt the Codex in his hand tremble and emit a low buzzing. Suddenly it transformed into a streak of black light and shot straight into the recess.

The square cavity was filled in an instant; the next moment the entire world thrummed.

A rustling sound arose and fragments of rock kept falling from above their heads, giving an involuntary sense that doomsday had come.

Faces shifted as everyone grew secretly alert, unsure what change would next occur.

With a crisp crack the heavy wall split and a blinding white light burst forth; in that instant everyone lost their sight.

At the same time a vast, irresistible suction issued from the rift; even figures as powerful as Changyuan and Meng Wuya were helpless before it.

With strange cries they were all swallowed by the fissure and vanished.

As if a ferocious beast had swallowed them whole.

In the next instant, within a vast world of blinding white, the many Demon experts, along with Yang Kai, Meng Wuya, and the others, appeared one after another.

“Kid, where's that Demon God's Secret Codex?” Meng Wuya checked himself briefly then hurriedly asked Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned, felt within, and said softly, “It's back!”

The instant they were swallowed by the rift, the Codex used to open the seal returned to Yang Kai's body.

“Good.” Meng Wuya nodded.

“What is that?” Meng Ge suddenly shouted, his voice full of astonishment as if he'd seen something incredible.

Following his gaze everyone shrank back, all of them stunned.

Before them was a ship!

An incredibly massive vessel.

But it was unclear how long the ship had rested there; it was already tattered, the hull bearing many marks left by past battles.

Strangest of all, the ship had no mast, and there were no signs it had ever been immersed in water — as if it had never sailed.

A desolate aura spread from the wreck, imparting a sense of its great age.

Yang Kai scanned it and sent out his divine sense; to his surprise the materials used to build the ship were all of the highest grade, and even through its battered hull it radiated the aura of a Saint‑Grade Secret Treasure.

Their expressions turned strange and they silently gaped.

How many materials would it take to forge a vessel this vast? Those materials alone could have produced hundreds upon hundreds of Saint‑Grade Secret Treasures.

“Is the Great Demon's secret this?” Changyuan looked unable to accept it, murmuring to himself with deep disappointment.

He had speculated countless times what might be here — he had dreamed there would be the Great Demon God's cultivation method, divine arts, or secrets capable of raising his realm.

He had such lofty expectations that he lowered his status to befriend Yang Kai, hoping to use the Demon God's Secret Codex in Yang Kai's possession to open this seal.

Yet when he truly arrived and opened the sealing that successive Demon Lords could not, he discovered the situation was nothing like he'd imagined.

It was only a wrecked ship!

Even though the battered ship emanated the aura of Saint‑Grade Secret Treasures, what use was it? For sailing? Changyuan's strength was supreme; he had no need of a vessel to go to sea.

He could not accept it.

He even suspected everything here might be a joke the Great Demon God had played on posterity.

“It seems there's only this one wrecked ship here!” Meng Wuya sneered, his face full of malicious delight.

The more disappointed Changyuan became, the happier he felt—he wished nothing more than for Changyuan to be disappointed to death.

“It shouldn't be so simple.” Yang Kai frowned. In that strange world the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation had said that if he went to the Demon Capital all would be revealed. Now he had come, opened the millennia‑old seal, and reached the moment of clarification, yet things did not match his expectations.

He felt some disappointment too.

If it were only to see this wrecked ship, why had he journeyed across countless miles to get here?

He spread his divine sense; apart from this wreck revealed here, there truly was nothing else.

“The secret is hidden on that ship — search it!” Changyuan seemed to regain himself, waved his hand and barked.

The four Demon Generals exchanged looks and darted toward the wreck.

“I'll take a look too!” Meng Wuya cackled and, with a flicker of movement, pounced toward the ship alongside the Four Great Demon Generals, clearly unwilling to let anyone else snatch favors.

Yang Kai shook his head and declined to join the scramble.
