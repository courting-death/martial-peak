## Chapter 1507 — The Stone Embryo Changes

"Sect Master, you really needn't be overly concerned. The Imperial Treasure's might may be unfathomable, but its power is limited by the user's cultivation; it's essentially a one-strike affair — after that single blow it can do no more. You've experienced it firsthand, so you should understand better than anyone." Seeing Yang Kai's wary face, Ye Xijun offered comfort.

"That may be so." Yang Kai nodded lightly; the dread in his heart eased considerably and he suddenly felt much more relaxed.

The power of a Secret Treasure has always been tied to its user's strength, so no matter how high the Secret Treasure's rank or how great its potency, if the wielder's cultivation is insufficient it cannot unleash earth-shattering might.

The Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade was exactly such a case. Although Yang Kai now wielded it with ease, without the slightest awkwardness, he still felt it held a vast untapped potential.

That potential did not lie in the Dragon Bone Sword itself, but within himself.

His own strength limited the Dragon Bone Sword's performance.

"If the Sect Master intends to take action this time, you should take me along. Since Star Emperor Mountain has already betrayed its original ideals, I cannot stand idly by, and... I also wish to meet an old acquaintance and settle some old scores." Ye Xijun said.

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow; his curiosity flared.

He was very curious why Ye Xijun had left Star Emperor Mountain back then. After all, she had once been the one at the helm of that behemoth, her status exalted beyond measure; unless compelled by dire circumstances, she would never have retired to seclusion for over a hundred years.

Yet such matters were awkward to pry into. If Ye Xijun wished to speak, he would of course listen respectfully; if she did not, there was no point in forcing it.

One thing was certain: Ye Xijun and Star Emperor Mountain harbored grievances between them.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai did not voice his doubts. Instead he said soberly, "This is my plan. Great Elder, listen: if there is anything amiss, please advise..."

With that, Yang Kai calmly laid out his plan.

An hour later, Yang Kai left Hundred Flowers Residence and returned to Tianyi Palace.

The palace was exceedingly tranquil. Yang Kai sat cross-legged, produced the Feather Spirit Arrow, and poured Saint Yuan into it to recharge.

The Secret Treasure he had obtained in the Fallen Emperor Mountains was indeed formidable, despite its limit on uses. That could not erase its miraculous effect: a cultivator at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could not withstand a single strike from it; even someone like Qu Zheng at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could only evade — he dared not take it head-on.

During his time in the Fallen Emperor Mountains the Feather Spirit Arrow had exhausted its energy, so Yang Kai naturally had to recharge it again.

In no more than half an hour the task was complete.

Yang Kai carefully put it away and was about to make further preparations when his expression suddenly changed; he smiled and fixed his gaze on a particular spot on the ground, waiting silently.

After a moment, a small head bizarrely pushed up from the earth. Its angles were distinct and its lines rugged, like a stubborn stone, yet its pair of eyes were dazzlingly bright and extraordinary spirited.

Stone Puppet.

This time Yang Kai had not brought the Stone Puppet with him; he had left it at the Sect.

For one, Yang Kai hadn’t expected this trip to be filled with so many twists and turns, nor to face battles of such intensity—otherwise, bringing the Stone Puppet along would have been a great help.

Secondly, the Stone Puppet had other duties to attend to.

The Stone Puppet's duty was to guard the stone embryo of another Stone Puppet. After leaving the Imperial Garden, Yang Kai had fused the Blood Essence Stone with that stone embryo in hopes of birthing a second Stone Puppet, so he had assigned the guarding task to Xiaoxiao.

Now that he had returned to the Sect, it had sensed him and immediately come to Tianyi Palace.

Yang Kai did not know whether the second Stone Puppet had been successfully born; he was full of expectation.

But when he looked at Xiaoxiao he frowned and hurriedly asked, "What is it?"

The eyes that were normally clear and bright instead revealed panic. Xiaoxiao leapt from the ground, scrambling with all fours to Yang Kai's side, hunched its small body, grabbed at Yang Kai's trouser leg, and emitted strange, urgent noises as it tried desperately to drag him away.

"What has happened?" As the Stone Puppet's master, Yang Kai could sense its agitation and unease, but a Stone Puppet was also a living thing with low intellect. Yang Kai had only fed it a single drop of Golden Blood when it was born, so he could not clearly perceive its thoughts.

"You want me to go with you?" Yang Kai asked again, and the Stone Puppet vigorously nodded its head.

"Lead on!" Yang Kai nodded lightly and allowed the Stone Puppet to drag him outward.

Before long, man and Stone Puppet left the Lingxiao Sect headquarters and headed into the depths of the mountain range.

The Lingxiao Sect headquarters now stood upon the ruins of the ancient Taixuan Sect. Those ruins were vast, and Lingxiao's holdings occupied only a small portion.

The place the Stone Puppet led Yang Kai to could be considered the Taixuan Sect's main hall, only situated atop a lofty peak.

That peak rose ten thousand zhang into the clouds, jagged and precipitous in the chaotic world, its scenery singularly sublime.

An hour later, the Stone Puppet escorted Yang Kai to the summit. There, on a plaza-like platform, a magnificent palace stood.

It was likely a palace once erected by the Taixuan Sect, though now it was utterly deserted.

Right before that palace lay an odd, blood-red round stone about the size of a washbasin. Thick Spiritual Qi seemed to be drawn into it from the surroundings.

One could even hear a thumping sound like a heartbeat issuing from the round stone — strong and rhythmic.

The stone embryo of the second Stone Puppet!

Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

The embryo had been well tended. After fusing with the Blood Essence Stone it nearly possessed life, yet strangely the creature within had not broken free of its shell; by rights, after so much time it ought to have been born.

Yang Kai frowned.

With his perception he could see that something was amiss within the embryo; no wonder Xiaoxiao had acted so frantically.

Upon arriving, Xiaoxiao scuttled to the embryo and anxiously paced about, scratching at the earth as though maddened by an itch, doing nothing that brought it satisfaction.

"Let me take a look, don't be anxious," Yang Kai soothed. The Stone Puppet obeyed at once, sitting upright and watching with eager eyes.

The embryo harbored its kin; even with low intellect, Xiaoxiao understood the instinct to protect its own.

Yang Kai approached the embryo and sent out his Divine Sense to investigate; his expression shifted.

The embryo had concentrated an unimaginable amount of energy, and that energy was increasing. Perhaps it was due to the extreme density of the Spiritual Qi here, but the embryo was ceaselessly drawing Spiritual Qi from its surroundings.

The heartbeat-like sound grew far more distinct and powerful, yet no matter how Yang Kai probed, the life within the embryo showed no sign of breaking out — not even the faintest soul fluctuation.

Without a soul fluctuation, it meant its life was incomplete; intelligence had not yet formed.

Yang Kai was baffled.

He had no idea how to handle the situation.

He had only learned of the existence of this special kind of life from Yang Yan; otherwise he would not have known such strange beings existed in the world. As for how a Stone Puppet could be safely born, he was completely ignorant.

Perhaps, had Yang Yan been here, she could have provided an explanation.

But since returning from the Imperial Garden, Yang Yan had fused with the Emperor's main body and fallen into slumber; even if Yang Kai sought her out, he would gain no assistance.

After careful thought, Yang Kai reached out to touch the stone embryo.

In any case, the energy stored within the embryo was far too massive; that could not be right. The embryo's failure to be born, and its lack of intelligence, very likely had something to do with that enormous energy.

So this must be the meaning of “when the foundation is weak, nourishment cannot take hold.”

Yang Kai hoped to guide some of the energy outward to spare the fragile embryo from harm.

Yet the moment his hand touched the embryo, an intricate, complex pattern suddenly surfaced on its shell. The pattern spun, and transformed into an exceedingly terrifying burst of energy that surged toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face changed drastically and he hurriedly sidestepped.

With a whoosh the energy brushed past his body and shot straight into the heavens.

After a few breaths, a hole actually appeared in the distant sky, as if that blow had pierced the very heavens.

Yang Kai stared in horror, no longer daring to act rashly.

Xiaoxiao fixed its gaze on him, uttering strange sounds as if begging, both eyes full of grief.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

At this stage he felt he could do no more; everything would have to proceed naturally.

As if understanding Yang Kai's thoughts, Xiaoxiao's demeanor drooped; it lowered its head and sat there foolishly, staring at the embryo.

Time passed slowly. The energy within the embryo swelled ever greater, and the heartbeat-like rhythm grew so frantic it sent tremors through Yang Kai's heart.

It was an extremely abnormal rhythm, like drumbeats beating on and on, and with each sound the light on the embryo began to flicker — now bright, now dim.

This continued for a full five days, until on the fifth day the situation finally changed.

The blood-red glow on the embryo suddenly flared brilliantly, blindingly bright; at the same time, a staggering fluctuation of energy erupted from within the embryo.

Yang Kai widened his eyes and stared unblinkingly at the commotion before him.

Slowly the light dimmed, and the intense drumlike beating vanished simultaneously. The terrifying energy fluctuation within the embryo likewise dissipated without a trace.

A weight sank into Yang Kai's chest. He sent out his Divine Sense to probe and his face darkened.

The embryo had lost even its original life vibration, as if it had truly become nothing more than a common stone.

Xiaoxiao noticed and hurried to the embryo, gently patting it and chattering incomprehensibly. It then picked it up, brought it to Yang Kai, and pressed it into his arms, clearly urging him to think of a remedy.

Yang Kai opened his mouth but found no words; in the end he was speechless and let out a deep sigh.
