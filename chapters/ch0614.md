## Chapter 614 — Have a safe trip to the underworld!

A hundred zhang away from Yang Kai and Shui Ling, more than twenty Divine Roaming Realm experts and Xing Zong halted, their faces grave as they stared ahead, deep apprehension shining in their eyes.

"Master Xing, that place is the absolute death zone of the Wasteland — do we really go in?" the big Great Han man from before asked in alarm.

The so-called absolute death zone meant that once anyone approached that place, no one would leave it alive.

Even Transcendent Realm experts were no exception!

Years ago a Transcendent Realm expert from Tianlang attempted to probe the mysteries hidden in the Wasteland and perished near here. When the news spread the entire Tianlang was shaken. Since then this area within a radius of a hundred zhang was called the absolute death zone.

Anyone who came to the Wasteland seeking opportunity would keep far away from that area.

They had not expected that the two Great Han warriors they were chasing would run to this spot, which left them in some embarrassment.

Xing Zong himself hesitated as well; past lessons were a cautionary teacher, and he dared not be careless.

After a long moment his expression hardened: "What is there to fear? Since they emerged unscathed, the rumors must be false. If any of you lack the nerve, stay outside and watch. Two mere Great Han warriors? I can handle them with ease."

He had brought these twenty or so people along on the chance there might be trouble. Although he was Transcendent Realm, and dealing with two Great Han cultivators would be little effort, in the Wasteland nothing could be judged by ordinary rules — more people made matters simpler.

Saying that, he strode inward, fury and hatred writ across his face.

The twenty-odd men hesitated for a moment, then trailed after him.

The hundred-zhang distance closed swiftly.

When Xing Zong reached five zhang in front of Yang Kai and saw the pair's faces clearly, his expression involuntarily froze.

He had not expected the two Great Han warriors he had pursued to be so young.

"Senluo Palace master?" Yang Kai cocked his head, wearing an impertinent, carefree look as he casually asked.

Xing Zong snorted coldly, muscles twitching on his face, his eyes blood-red: "You can recognize my identity — then you must be the murderer of my son, yes?"

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head: "Not me — it was her who killed him."

As he spoke he pointed at Shui Ling. She straightened up, looking as if she dared to bear the consequences, showing no trace of timidity as she hid behind Yang Kai, borrowing his might for show.

She did not know why Yang Kai showed no fear facing a Transcendent Realm master, but that very composure made Shui Ling realize he had something to rely on.

Xing Zong's eyes narrowed, his terrifying eyes fixed on Shui Ling as his expression twisted: "No matter which of you struck the blow, today you must pay the price!"

Yang Kai regarded him leisurely and chuckled: "I wonder what price Master Xing demands of us?"

"A life for a life! Only your blood and souls can comfort my son's spirit in Heaven!"

"Can't we talk this out?" Yang Kai frowned. "To be honest, although I disliked your son, I had no intention of killing him. My companion here has a quick temper; your son leered at her and she killed him with a single move. He got what he deserved."

"Bastard!" Xing Zong roared, cutting Yang Kai off. "You would excuse my son's death simply because he was lecherous?"

"If I hadn't killed him, it wouldn't have been merely lechery that doomed him. You ought to know what sort of man your son is," Shui Ling snorted indignantly.

Xing Zong drew a deep breath and scrutinized Shui Ling, seeing beneath the dust on her face a trace of fair, delicate features. He immediately understood there had been some cause for Xing Bao's lecherousness.

"So it seems my son was at fault first."

"Indeed." Shui Ling nodded.

"Very well, then I'll give you a choice—choose how you die!"

The group of experts behind Xing Zong burst into boisterous laughter, their gazes mocking as they looked at Yang Kai and Shui Ling, shaking their heads inwardly; they thought these two Great Han warriors were blind, killing the son of the Senluo Palace master of Tianlang — they had it coming.

"Then there's nothing to discuss." Yang Kai shook his head vexedly. "I came to Tianlang merely passing through. I did not wish to provoke Tianlang's people or spill blood."

"You still intend to kill?" Xing Zong looked at Yang Kai as though he were a fool, snorting coldly: "You will not have that chance. After today you will be nothing but a corpse — never again shall you kill."

Yang Kai grinned, and suddenly a colossal Bone Shield materialized before him. The shield was the size of several houses, grotesque in design, rimmed with rows of violently thrusting sharp bone spikes, and the gaping beast-mouth at its center radiated catastrophic energy.

"Have a safe trip to the underworld!" Yang Kai waved to the Tianlang group through the Bone Shield.

Xing Zong and the more-than-twenty Divine Roaming Realm experts were instantly seized by an overwhelming dread.

No sooner had the thought arisen than the beast-mouth spat forth a torrent of world-shattering might.

A visible column of energy shot from the maw, containing immense void power, piercing outward a thousand zhang and carving a vacuum through the Wasteland.

Within that thousand-zhang span, everything was in an instant torn apart, cut by void force into innumerable specks of dust.

The Tianlang Divine Roaming Realm experts did not even have time to react — they were crushed to powder.

Only Xing Zong, more skilled than the rest, managed to withstand for a moment, but the endless onslaught overwhelmed him and he screamed as he died.

Shui Ling stood frozen.

Although she knew Yang Kai had some backing that allowed him to remain so calm, she had not expected his support to be so ferocious.

Before she had time to regain her senses, the enemies were already all dead, including the Transcendent Realm expert.

Shui Ling had never imagined Transcendent Realm masters could be so fragile.

Wave after wave of Divine Sense energy was drawn into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness by his attraction and slipped silently into his mind.

The gigantic Bone Shield in his hand quickly shrank back to its normal size after the burst.

Cracking sounds rang out…

Countless fissures raced across the Bone Shield; Yang Kai frowned and hurried to stow it away.

The last time he had used the Bone Shield to block the energies within the Void Passage under Zhongdu, the shield had been somewhat damaged; this eruption had damaged it even more severely.

Unless he found a master armorer to repair it, it would likely be unusable.

The chaotic energy around them changed subtly, as if that strike had triggered some anomaly; a series of unsettling sensations spread outward. Yang Kai and Shui Ling turned to look and their faces changed drastically.

From the direction of that deep blackness, the suppressed energy showed signs of erupting.

"Stay close." Yang Kai dared not delay and leapt toward it; Shui Ling hurried after him.

As they rushed toward the dark void, Yang Kai continuously poured out his True Yuan, directing it in a special rhythm to assault the surroundings.

This method was told to him in a final thought by Meng Wuya; only by using this technique could one break the last defenses and reach the location of the Void Passage.

If one blindly charged in without knowing the method, one would be struck down by those martial skills, each imbued with artistic conception and mystery.

It proved effective. Though chaotic energy raged around them, wherever Yang Kai's method passed there was no danger.

They waded through fire, crossed ice, passed through electric nets and other perils; at last Yang Kai led Shui Ling to that dark front.

He reached forward and pushed; his True Yuan forced its way in fiercely.

The deep darkness suddenly opened, and a nauseating sense of void transmitted through them.

"The way home!" Shui Ling's eyes brightened, her excitement boundless.

"Go!" Yang Kai grabbed her and shoved her into the Void Passage; in the next moment he dove in after her.

Darkness enveloped them on all sides; the void's chaos wrapped them as if heaven and earth had not yet formed, day and night indistinguishable.

An unbearable sense of weightlessness came over them; even composed Yang Kai felt a momentary panic and dismay.

A small hand groped through the dark and tightly seized Yang Kai's — it was Shui Ling!

She was terrified and instinctively sought some support from Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gently squeezed her palm, offering a measure of comfort.

This passage through the Void felt different from previous times. Before they had only transported within Great Han territory; the distances had not been great. This time it led to an alien land.

They fell and fell, seemingly without end.

After an unknown time Yang Kai suddenly saw a bright light; the darkness vanished and gave way to a blue sky and the fresh, clear scent of earth.

Crackle…

The two of them tumbled to the ground in succession, the mud and water coating them in filth.

They hastily rose and looked around.

Beneath their feet was a muddy swamp; sparse small trees dotted the area and peculiar beasts moved through the marsh in and out.

There was no immediate danger, though Yang Kai's expression was odd.

The Spiritual Qi of this land was exceedingly rich; compared to Zhongdu after the Great Change it was even more abundant. Standing there, his pores all opened, the True Yang Technique vibrated and ran, greedily sucking up the surrounding Spiritual Qi.

"Ha ha!" Shui Ling, stunned for a moment, burst into loud laughter. "We're back, we're back — I'm finally back!"

"This is Tongxuan Continent?" Yang Kai looked at her and asked.

Shui Ling nodded excitedly, mud splashing from her hair; filthy and disheveled, she seemed not to care and instead rushed over to embrace Yang Kai, choking with gratitude: "Thank you, thank you for bringing me home."

Yang Kai's emotions swelled; he lifted his face to the blue sky and a faint smile curved his lips.

Tongxuan Continent, at last we have come!

Beneath this sky, Su Yan and my little senior sister should also be watching; they should have stepped onto this land as well.

And Shopkeeper Meng and Di Mo.

Living beneath the same heavens, the moment of finding them must eventually arrive!

Yang Kai took a deep breath and quickly calmed his excitement.
