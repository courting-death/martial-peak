## Chapter 291 — Locking Demon Chain

Yang Kai stared blankly, suddenly gasping in shock, “I know who this person is!”

“Who?” 

“The demon that was slain by my sect's ancestor here hundreds of years ago!”

The Earth Demon was not clear about the origins of the Lingxiao Pavilion, so Yang Kai briefly recounted the story.

Upon hearing that the Dragon Confinement Ravine was cleaved open by a demon's sword, the Earth Demon became greatly excited, his tone slightly agitated, “After hundreds of years, his physical body remains intact. This demon has a bit of the old man's style from back in the day.”

Yang Kai was also secretly alarmed.

A person who died hundreds of years ago, although their flesh had nearly withered, still had not been destroyed, and had even given rise to such a dense Malevolent Aura, filling the entire Dragon Confinement Ravine. How powerful must this person have been in life?

How formidable must the ancestor of the Lingxiao Pavilion, who could slay him, have been?

This was already beyond what the current Yang Kai could aspire to, at least not in the short term.

With a horrified expression, he turned to look around and discovered a deep Seal mark not far away. He approached and crouched down to investigate carefully, his eyes suddenly brightening.

This place should have been where the Sect Leader's second disciple had sat in meditation and cultivation for many years. He had spent countless years sitting here, leaving behind these traces.

If that were the case, the Sect Leader's second disciple must have gleaned some profound insights from this deceased demon or obtained something, allowing him to recover his strength and escape after more than a decade.

The Sect Leader had sealed him in the Dragon Confinement Ravine, which had indeed led to his accomplishments.

Such is the unpredictability of the world; no one can explain it clearly.

“Master…” the Earth Demon suddenly called out. His voice contained a hint of excitement and anticipation, “Can you retrieve the treasure from around this demon's neck?”

“Of course!” Yang Kai had long since noticed the extraordinary nature of that collar. This item was extremely rigid and Yang attribute treasure, specifically designed to restrain evil demonic energy. Yang Kai practiced the True Yang Technique, which was highly compatible with this treasure, so he would not let it slip away.

This treasure must have been left by the ancestor of the Lingxiao Pavilion to suppress the demonic energy of this demon. However, after hundreds of years, the Sect Leader's second disciple had apparently tampered with it, and the demonic energy could no longer be suppressed. This treasure had remained here without being able to exert its function.

“But whether I take it or not has nothing to do with you,” Yang Kai said suspiciously, faintly sensing that the Earth Demon had some ulterior motives.

“Hehe…” the Earth Demon chuckled awkwardly. “If you can retrieve this treasure, I can attempt to take over this demon's body.”

“Seizing the body?” Yang Kai's expression changed slightly.

“No, no, no…” the Earth Demon hurriedly explained, “His soul has long since perished, leaving only a physical body. My soul entering would not count as seizing the body.”

“Are you confident?”

“Hmm, a little. He was also a demon in life, so my aura is somewhat similar to his. I want to see if I can drive this body.” The Earth Demon smiled bitterly, “In truth, whether seizing a body or having one's soul enter another's body is not as simple as you think, Master. A person's body is like a specialized container; this container will only accommodate a specific soul. Other souls find it hard to survive within.”

“Then why did you insist on seizing my body when you first met me?” Yang Kai smirked, recalling past events.

The Earth Demon chuckled awkwardly, “That was also unavoidable. I had been sealed for many years. I had just awakened not long before encountering you, so I had to make do. However, even if you hadn’t resisted, it would have likely failed anyway.”

“What would the consequences be?”

“Your soul would be obliterated by me, and I would control your body. At most, I could only survive for half a month to a month before it would decay. By then, I would become a wandering soul once more.” The Earth Demon casually recounted the aftermath of a failed body seizure, causing Yang Kai's complexion to turn pale.

Fortunately, the Proud Bone Golden Body had played a role that day; otherwise, he would have truly died in vain.

“And regardless of whether the body seizure succeeds or not, my own soul's power would be greatly depleted. Thus, even a powerful soul would not casually seize another person's body. One would only act under very suitable circumstances.” The Earth Demon patiently explained.

“Does this person's body meet your requirements?”

“Yes! I hope Master will grant this request. If I can control this person's body, the effect I can exert will be much greater than now, and I can truly assist you.” The Earth Demon felt ashamed; in the two years he had followed Yang Kai, he had not played the role expected of a ten-thousand-year-old demon. Now, seeing this suitable fleshly body, he was naturally quite tempted.

“Alright, I also look forward to it!” Yang Kai grinned, agreeing to the Earth Demon's request.

Approaching the demon's body, Yang Kai reached out and grasped the chain, infusing it with True Yuan.

In less than half a day's time, the chain suddenly transformed into a golden stream of light, drilling into Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai's expression was slightly astonished.

He had thought that refining and retrieving such a treasure would certainly take a long time. He had even prepared to stay here for another month or two, but he did not expect the process to be so simple and effortless.

As the chain vanished, the black dragon rolling beside the demon's body seemed to have broken free from some restraint, ferociously charging upward. Not only that, but the demonic energy continuously surged out from within the demon's body, rising in a terrifying manner.

Yang Kai quickly stabilized his form, his expression grave as he unleashed the Soul-Breaking Spike.

The Earth Demon concealed himself within, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

The surging Malevolent Aura suddenly slowed significantly, likely due to the Earth Demon taking control.

Yang Kai called out several times, but there was no response. However, judging by the reaction of the demonic energy spilling from the demon's body, the Earth Demon was likely in the process of taking over this body; he just did not know how long it would take.

This was the Earth Demon's own battle, and Yang Kai could not assist.

With no choice, he could only sit cross-legged nearby, waiting quietly.

In this place filled with Malevolent Aura, Yang Kai could not cultivate in the Soul Palace, as his Divine Sense would surely be obliterated once it left his mind. Without the ability to use his Divine Sense, he naturally could not capture the malevolent and fierce energies.

Bored, Yang Kai took out the chain he had just absorbed into his body.

This chain was quite remarkable, and he did not know what material it was forged from. However, since it was a treasure left by the ancestor of the Lingxiao Pavilion to suppress demons, its quality would certainly not be low.

The chain was only about a foot long, with a collar at the top, just right for binding around a person's neck.

Inside the collar, there was a line of small characters. Leaning in closely to read, Yang Kai murmured, “Locking Demon Chain!”

This item likely had no use for ordinary people; it was entirely aimed at demons.

Looking at this Locking Demon Chain, Yang Kai was lost in thought.

The Sect Leader's second disciple had been able to glean profound insights from the demon, thus recovering his strength. He must have discovered the existence of the Locking Demon Chain long ago. However, he still could not retrieve this treasure, indicating how much it restrained him.

If he could find an opportunity to place this item around his neck… regardless of whether he was the Evil Lord or not, he would likely be locked down, unable to use any True Yuan.

This was indeed a good item to deal with him!

Thinking of this uncle who had become the Evil Lord but whom he had never met, Yang Kai's expression turned cold.

Ling Taixu had worried about him for over a decade, and Fourth Master Yang had been severely wounded because of this person, not having fully recovered even to this day.

One could even say that Yang Kai's own congenital deficiencies were entirely due to him.

Thus, even though the two had never met, they were already enemies.

As enemies, Yang Kai naturally did not wish for him to live comfortably.

With a solemn face, he stored the Locking Demon Chain back into his body, nurturing it with his True Yuan, waiting for the day it could exert its true function.

Days passed, and the Earth Demon continued to merge with the demon's body. No matter how Yang Kai called out, there was no response.

On the fifth day, the Earth Demon's weak voice finally came through, “Master…”

“What’s the situation?” Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

“Almost done.” The Earth Demon was panting, his soul power evidently depleted. Fortunately, the dense evil energy in this place allowed for replenishment at any time. “However, I need to first gather the evil energy here; otherwise, this person's body alone cannot exert much power.”

“How long will it take?”

“This will be slow, at least a few months.”

“That long… then I won’t wait for you.” Yang Kai said as he stood up.

“Hmm, Master, you may go about your business. I will seek you out once I finish here.”

As he spoke, the Earth Demon began to devour the demonic energy in the Dragon Confinement Ravine. The dense, almost tangible evil energy seemed to be drawn by something, all rushing into the demon's body.

At this moment, the demon's body resembled a bottomless pit, absorbing all the incoming demonic energy.

Yang Kai watched in shock and no longer paid him any mind, using the Wings of Yang Flame to fly directly up from the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Lingxiao Pavilion was desolate.

The once-thousands of disciples had long since vanished. Many had left the sect out of fear of being implicated by the changes in the Dragon Confinement Ravine and the emergence of the Evil Lord, while more had been dispersed by Ling Taixu's order.

Now, only about a hundred people remained in the entire Lingxiao Pavilion. These hundred were the most steadfast members of the Lingxiao Pavilion, the disciples most loyal to the sect.

No matter how Ling Taixu persuaded them, these individuals were unwilling to leave the sect, vowing to live or die with it!

In response, Ling Taixu could only helplessly acquiesce.

In Su Yan's small loft, Yang Kai flashed in. After nearly two months apart, Su Yan had successfully advanced to the Ninth Stage of the True Yuan Realm and was preparing to break through to the Divine Roaming Realm.

Sitting face to face while cultivating together, Yang Kai listened to Su Yan recount the changes in the sect over the past two months.

His heart was also filled with sorrow.

A once-great sect now faced the fate of dissolution. No one could accept such an outcome, but Ling Taixu was helpless. The origins of the Evil Lord would eventually be uncovered. To avoid implicating the ordinary disciples, the only option was to disperse them first.
