## Chapter 672 — Giant Stone City

At the edge of the snowy mountains stood Giant Stone City.

It was the only city for thousands of li around; martial artists poured into it so densely the streets could scarcely contain them, and every marketplace and shop was booming with business.

Near the snow mountains Leiguang Divine Cult was not the only Sect rooted here; two or three other forces had also taken hold, and Giant Stone City, serving as the transit hub for these powers, naturally became the pivot for exchanging supplies and materials among their cultivators.

A cultivator’s training is not simply a matter of closing one’s doors and working alone; one frequently relies on outside things.

Pills and Secret Treasures are external aids — indispensable in combat — and trading away what one does not need to obtain what one does is the natural origin of commerce.

After parting ways with Ji Meng and Zhu Yingyue, Yang Kai traveled for four days before finally arriving at Giant Stone City.

Seeing the crowds pushing and jostling, Yang Kai broke into a pleased smile; during this time he had been lonely to death.

He did not really seek to talk to anyone; rather, in that vast sweep of snow mountains, a world empty for thousands of li with not a trace of life had made him feel somewhat stifled.

At the city gate a few guards in sentry garb were checking passersby. When it was Yang Kai’s turn he imitated the method he had seen earlier entrants use and quietly slipped a Crystal Stone to one of the guards.

The guard took the Crystal Stone without showing any sign, flicked Yang Kai a look, and stepped aside.

“Much obliged!” Yang Kai chuckled and strode into Giant Stone City.

Giant Stone City was not only populated by cultivators from the nearby forces; wanderers from all corners of the land came here because, owing to the adjacent Pi Ling Snow Mountain, certain Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines that only form under extreme cold could be harvested here, and many cultivators were in need of them.

Giant Stone City admitted all comers, but if one wished to avoid inspection one had to hand over a Crystal Stone — this was one of the city’s revenues.

The shops that crowded the city were its true money trees.

The owners of those shops were, for the most part, disciples of the nearby forces; very few outsiders could insert themselves into the trade here.

Yang Kai moved with a light step, lingering through the shops and purchasing the medicinal materials he needed.

Although before leaving the Small Xuan Realm he had left most of his Crystal Stones with the Ancient Demon Clan, he still had a fair amount left; for one person this quantity of Crystal Stones was still quite comfortable.

Yang Kai was also keeping an eye out for materials needed to refine Saint-Grade Pills.

Before he left, Li Rong had already told him about these things; what surprised Yang Kai was that it was actually a Saint-Grade Upper-Level Pill.

He could barely refine Upper-Level Spirit-Grade Pills now; there remained a considerable gap to Saint-Grade Upper-Level Pills.

Along the way he swept dozens of shops and amassed a rich haul; all kinds of medicinal materials were piled into the Black Book Space like mountains.

In a fairly large shop Yang Kai spent a large number of Crystal Stones to exchange for many of the materials he needed.

“Young man, you look unfamiliar — buying so many herbs to refine Pills yourself?” the shopkeeper, who cultivated to Divine Roaming Eighth Stage, regarded Yang Kai with interest; his hair was streaked with white, he looked affable, and he stroked his beard as he asked.

“Are you a merchant or a gossipmonger?” Yang Kai fixed him with a look and asked back with a faint smile.

The sudden question naturally put him on guard, but security in Giant Stone City was fairly sound; nothing would happen here without reason, and cultivators who had disputes would go outside the city to settle them.

Thus he felt no fear at all.

“Just asking casually. If you don’t want to answer, you needn’t,” the shopkeeper said in surprise, as if sensing Yang Kai’s wariness and not wishing to be misunderstood. “But if you are a Pill master, you can get a discount when buying herbs.”

“A discount? Why would there be a discount?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

He had never heard of any shop offering discounts to Pill masters.

Before the shopkeeper could answer, a cultivator searching for herbs nearby laughed and said, “Because this is a shop run by the Alchemists’ Association — any alchemist can enjoy various privileges. Didn’t you know?”

Saying that, he walked over, handed his selected herbs to the shopkeeper, and also presented a jade token.

Yang Kai saw clearly that the jade token had the character for Pill carved on it.

The shopkeeper glanced at the herbs, calculated the price, then took the jade token and poured True Yuan into it; the token flashed with light and the shopkeeper nodded slightly: “A Spirit-Grade Lower-Level alchemist — by the Association’s rules, you’re entitled to an eighty percent charge.”

The man hastily handed over his Crystal Stones; the shopkeeper took them and the transaction was complete.

After buying the herbs, that man left without looking back.

Yang Kai watched, dumbfounded.

“The Alchemists’ Association is a force established by the alchemists themselves. Only alchemists have the qualification to enter. Association shops offer privileges to members, and the Association has branches in major cities throughout the land — wherever you go you will receive the Association’s care,” the shopkeeper explained with a smile.

“How did you know I am an alchemist?” Yang Kai asked in puzzlement; it was obvious the other had already confirmed his identity, and feigning ignorance would be useless.

He wondered how this old shopkeeper, only a Divine Roaming Eighth Stage cultivator, had such discernment.

“Those who refine Pills are different from ordinary cultivators. I’ve guarded this shop for decades; many who pass through are alchemists. Whether someone works in this field, I can see at a glance,” the shopkeeper said, shaking his head slowly as if profound. “Young man, though you are young, from the grade of herbs you chose you must at least be a Mystery-Grade Lower-Level alchemist, right?”

Yang Kai answered indifferently and did not deny it.

The old shopkeeper’s eyes brightened. “Youth can be terrifying. I have studied alchemy many years and am still only a Mystery-Grade Upper-Level alchemist — I truly envy you.”

Refining Pills is also a matter of innate aptitude.

“There’s a branch of the Association in Giant Stone City. If you want to enjoy discounts when buying herbs in the future, you might as well go there to obtain a jade token. It will save you Crystal Stones and make traveling the world more convenient. Alchemists are prized wherever they go; seldom will anyone look for trouble with you,” the shopkeeper said with a smile.

“Thank you for the tip,” Yang Kai cupped his fist in thanks.

“You’re welcome.”

After leaving that shop, Yang Kai fell into deep thought.

There was no denying that the shopkeeper’s words moved him; discounts were one thing, but though he had many Crystal Stones now, that kind of wealth would not last forever — any saving was welcome.

What concerned him most was that alchemists being highly valued made them targets every force would scramble for.

Yang Kai had come to the Tongxuan Continent with one wish only: to find Su Yan and Little Junior Sister.

But this world was vast, and relying solely on his own strength he had no place to even begin searching.

It was not like in Zhongdu, where he had gathered a large number of available subordinates; to find someone or accomplish a task there he only needed to issue an order and it would immediately be dealt with.

Here, everything had to depend on himself.

When Shui Ling and Yun Xuan had invited him to join the Water Divine Hall or the Duao Alliance, Yang Kai could not refine Pills and thus politely declined their goodwill.

He wanted to rely on his own power to find Su Yan and the others.

But now that plan seemed somewhat impractical.

Might he use the identity of an alchemist to attach himself to some force and have them assist his search?

In an inn Yang Kai thought for a long time and finally decided he would first go to the Alchemists’ Association to obtain a jade token — a single token could spare him much trouble, and that alone justified the effort.

After asking around in Giant Stone City, Yang Kai quickly found the location of the Alchemists’ Association.

Before the magnificent Association building Yang Kai paused for a long while, shaking his head.

Though he had long heard that alchemists were a wealthy group, Yang Kai had not expected their riches to this degree.

From the outside, the entire Alchemists’ Association building was markedly different from the other structures in Giant Stone City; both inside and out it exuded an air of opulence.

Carved on the palace exterior were birds and beasts made from rare minerals; faint waves of energy rippled from them, clearly the imprints of powerful formations.

Anyone who dared covet that building would surely suffer a heavy loss.

Inside, the Association’s floors were laid with thick crimson rugs and studded here and there with gem-like, shimmering ornaments.

The alchemists who occasionally came and went wore an arrogant bearing, cold and aloof, as if they were someone of great consequence.

Top-tier alchemists, with supreme True Alchemy Formula craftsmanship, could be wealthy enough to rival a nation and held lofty status — this was no legend, but a reality.

In Zhongdu, alchemists and artificers were already considered noble existences, but on the Tongxuan Continent that mysterious nobility seemed amplified several times over.

“Kid, what are you skulking about and staring for?” a hoarse shout rang out. A whiskered hulking man glared at Yang Kai and barked, “Which Sect are you from? Don’t you know what sort of place this is?”

“Greetings,” Yang Kai replied without changing expression, inclining his head slightly. “I wish to obtain a jade token of an alchemist.”

“Obtain a jade token… you are an alchemist?” The hulking man was startled, sizing Yang Kai up. A Divine Sense swept over Yang Kai; after a moment he nodded slightly. “Hm, not bad — your True Yuan is Yang attribute, so you can refine Pills. But you’re too young, you’ve only just begun learning, right?”

“Heh heh, I haven’t studied long,” Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

“Hm, come in then.” The hulking man tilted his head and gestured inward, and Yang Kai hurried to follow.

As they walked in, Yang Kai clicked his tongue in wonder; from the outside the Association looked formidable, but inside it was positively dripping with wealth.

After learning Yang Kai was an alchemist, the hulking man toned down his contempt somewhat, though he remained brusque as he barked, “Since you want to become a member of the Alchemists’ Association, you only need to pass our test to receive the jade token. But remember this — even as a formal alchemist you must not commit acts that harm humanity; if you dare refine Pills for Demon or Yao races, do not blame the Association for cleaning house.”

“Cough, that goes without saying,” Yang Kai hurriedly replied.
