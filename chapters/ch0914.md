## Chapter 914 — Return

Over at Lingxiao Pavilion, Meng Wuya remained shrouded in secrecy, and that air of mystery followed him all the way to Zhongdu.

Yang Kai had never known his true depth or foundation until he came to the Tongxuan Continent and once conversed at length with the patriarch Chu Lingxiao; only then did he vaguely confirm Meng Wuya's real cultivation — Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Chu Lingxiao had said Meng Wuya once fought a desperate battle with the Demon Lord of the age, after which his life and death were unknown and his whereabouts remained a mystery.

After Yang Kai told Chu Lingxiao about Meng Wuya's situation, the patriarch guessed he had been struck by the Demon Lord's Tianxuan Sealing Art, which had reduced his strength to the level of the peak Divine Roaming Realm.

The Tianxuan Sealing Art comprised three seals in total, each stronger than the last, and Meng Wuya had long been searching for a way to lift them.

When he left Zhongdu he had successfully broken the first seal and restored himself to the upper limit of the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

Nearly ten years after returning to the Tongxuan Continent, he had likely broken the second seal as well, regaining the level of the First Stage of the Saint Realm.

While being scourged on that stone pillar the third seal collapsed of its own accord, and now he had reached peak strength.

It was, in a way, a blessing in disguise.

"I'm merely restored to my old strength, no need to be so astonished; but you, you little rascal—ten years away and your cultivation has risen to match Ningshang's? How many fortunes did you run into?" Meng Wuya cast his divine sense over Yang Kai, seeing his realm and voicing one astonishment after another.

He knew all too well how terrifying Xia Ningshang's talent was; keeping her at his side these years and instructing her without reserve was precisely why she had reached her present level.

Yet Yang Kai's progress in cultivation was by no means inferior to his disciple's; step by step he had caught up, and there was even a faint hint that he might surpass her.

When they left Zhongdu back then, the disciple's cultivation had been higher than this boy's.

This discovery shocked Meng Wuya.

"Heh, just luck," Yang Kai said, scratching his head.

Meng Wuya snorted and did not expose him. If Yang Kai had merely stumbled into a lucky opportunity, then yes—luck played a part—but for a person to grow to this level in ten years also required aptitude and tireless effort.

This kid... really worked himself to the bone, Meng Wuya realized sharply.

"If Ling brother knew of your current circumstances, he'd be greatly pleased," Meng Wuya murmured, thinking of his old friend Ling Taixu back in Zhongdu.

"Shopkeeper Meng, do you know how to return to Zhongdu from here?" Yang Kai asked hurriedly when the elder mentioned his master.

"Do you mean to bring Ling and the others over?" Meng Wuya guessed Yang Kai's intention.

"Yes. The cultivation environment here is far better. If Master had been born here, his cultivation would likely have already entered the Saint Realm." Yang Kai replied.

"You're right, but sadly I don't know how to return to Zhongdu! Back then I stumbled across the way by chance. After arriving in your world I was muddled and now I can't find the Void Passage I once used." Meng Wuya sighed.

Yang Kai felt a touch of disappointment.

"The idea of bringing them here is fine, but do you have the resources to settle them?" Meng Wuya asked with a smile. "Zhongdu has so many people—if they came to the Tongxuan Continent, I won't speak of other things, but can you protect them? Where would they live? How will you supply the cultivation materials? One person cannot possibly care for so many. If you can't manage all that, it's better they remain in Zhongdu; at least there they can cope and needn't fear what dangers might arise here."

"You need not worry about that," Li Rong said at his side with a faint smile. "My lord is no longer alone; he is fully capable of protecting anyone's safety."

"Huh? What do you mean by that?" Meng Wuya eyed Li Rong suspiciously.

"Because my lord is now the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land."

Meng Wuya's expression changed; he stared at Yang Kai, and after receiving confirmation his face twitched. "You actually became that place's Saint Lord? Their Saintess must be blind—how could she choose you?"

Yang Kai rolled his eyes, at a loss for words, while Li Rong covered her mouth and laughed softly.

Meng Wuya's expression suddenly turned grave. "So the old Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land is already dead?"

"Yes, not long after you and the little senior sister left the Sacred Land."

Meng Wuya sighed. "I suspected he didn't have long when I last saw him; I didn't expect him to go so soon. But your rise has been so rapid—surely you haven't cultivated the Sacred Land's inheritance methods?"

"No."

"Good—never cultivate them. As far as I know, that method trades one's life force for power: the faster the gains, the shorter the lifespan. I do not wish to see Ningshang weeping every day. With your aptitude and diligent training, you'll reach my level within a thousand years easily; there's no need to sacrifice longevity for a quick boost."

"Shopkeeper Meng is right; I think the same," Yang Kai said solemnly.

Meng Wuya looked fully rested now, his face radiant, his aura deep as the sea. He rose slowly and said, "Since you have a place to settle, then I and Ningshang will come stay with you for a while. This girl has suffered these years—always running around with me, never a stable life."

As he spoke he glanced at Xia Ningshang, who was still pretending to sleep, and shook his head helplessly.

His treasured disciple was good in every way but overly taken with this damn boy and painfully shy; after only ten years she did not even dare open her eyes to look at him.

If she were to follow this boy forever, wouldn't he bully her to death?

At the thought Meng Wuya felt suffocated, as if a fishbone stuck in his throat—he wanted nothing more than to strangle Yang Kai alive.

Yang Kai had already taken Xia Ningshang in his arms at the waist; her body was soft and intoxicating, making his heart flutter.

The little senior sister's delicate form gradually radiated astonishing heat.

"Lead the way," Meng Wuya said lightly—out of sight, out of mind.

Earlier, while the yao had still been here, he had heard them talking and knew the Nine Heavens Sacred Land lay two months' journey from this place.

Yang Kai had no intention of flight; instead he waved and a bluish-green light shot forth like a long shuttle, hovering before them and lengthening on the wind until it reached about three zhang long, then stopped.

"Ah, this secret treasure is of fine grade," Meng Wuya, a man of discernment, exclaimed, his eyes lighting up. "Looks like the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens treats his own rather well."

He naturally assumed the treasure had been left behind by successive Saint Lords of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Li Rong, however, recognized the origin of the shuttle and cried out, "Isn't that the very thing?"

"Yes. After refining it I discovered it is a flying secret treasure."

"A flying secret treasure?" Meng Wuya raised a brow. "Rare to see."

"Its speed is extraordinary."

"How extraordinary?" Meng Wuya asked Yang Kai in astonishment.

"You'll see," Yang Kai grinned, not explaining further. The speed of a flying shuttle had to be seen to be believed. "Please get on."

Meng Wuya and Li Rong wasted no time and leapt onto the flying shuttle.

Yang Kai settled behind them with Xia Ningshang in his arms, arranging the little senior sister into a comfortable posture before warning, "Hold on tight."

With a thought the flying shuttle became a streak of light that seemed to break the bonds of space; in an instant they were hundreds of li away.

Sitting at the very front, Meng Wuya widened his eyes as his divine sense spread like a tide; when he ascertained how unbelievably fast the treasure was, his body trembled.

Li Rong covered her mouth in astonishment.

"Kid, how can this secret treasure move with such uncanny speed? Who forged it?" Meng Wuya transmitted his disbelief after a long moment.

The flying shuttle's speed was several times faster than a top expert's full-power flight.

"I don't know who forged it. Li Rong and I found it by chance in the starry sky a year ago," Yang Kai explained simply; he had no reason to hide the truth from Meng Wuya.

"The starry sky? You actually entered the starry sky?" Meng Wuya exclaimed.

"Yes. If you want to go, I'll take you someday," Yang Kai said, thinking he must be curious about that legendary place.

"No need..." Unexpectedly Meng Wuya slowly shook his head, his expression grave. After a moment he said, "I should have been to the starry sky."

Li Rong asked with a puzzled smile, "Sir, why do you say you should have been there?"

"Because back then I was in a daze while bound to that pillar," Meng Wuya recalled. "I always felt that place was extraordinary. While being tormented there my soul seemed to leave my body and travel to many places; the starry sky was one of them. Those places were scattered across the Tongxuan Continent in every direction, tens of thousands of li apart. But because I was enduring such torment my recollections are fuzzy."

He paused, then added, "Little Yang, I have a bad feeling—as if you shouldn't have destroyed that place."

"Shopkeeper Meng says the same?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Who told you that?"

"The Great Demon God's soul incarnation! He said that place is the continent's nexus and warned that if I destroyed it I would suffer unimaginable consequences."

"A nexus?" Meng Wuya frowned and asked what else the incarnation had said.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and answered, "He also said... never mind—this world has been sealed long enough; it's time it sees the light again."

Meng Wuya fell silent, apparently lost in deep thought.
