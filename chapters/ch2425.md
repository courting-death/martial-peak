## Chapter 2425 — Asking For the Lion's Share

Feng Xi’s face instantly turned pale, his throat tightening. The last time Yang Kai said something like this, both he and Yao Zhuo lost their Spatial Rings. Now he was saying it again—who knew what outrageous demand he’d make this time? Suddenly, he understood the source of his earlier unease.

Feng Xuan also looked at Yang Kai with a strange expression and said coolly, “Are you bargaining with this Lord?”

Yang Kai glanced at him carelessly and said, “Since you want to take back this Bloodjade Qilin, you’ll have to pay a price. You’re not young anymore, First Brother. Don’t you know there’s no such thing as a free lunch in this world?”

Feng Xuan forcibly suppressed the anger in his heart, his face grew extremely unsightly, and he snorted, “How much?”

Yang Kai burst out laughing. “You’re straightforward, much better than your son. For your forthrightness, I won’t ask for much—just this amount.”

He held up a single finger and waved it lightly in front of him.

Feng Xuan nodded slightly. “Ten million—not too much.”

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, then chuckled, “Ten million? Are you joking? This Bloodjade Qilin has been passed down in your Sect for generations. It may not be a priceless treasure, but it carries great symbolic meaning. In your eyes, it’s only worth ten million?”

“You want a hundred million?” Feng Xuan’s eyes flashed coldly as he shouted, “Your appetite is too big, boy. Be careful you don’t burst!”

“A hundred million?” Yang Kai sneered, “Wenqing Sect is wealthy and powerful. You’d really offer a hundred million? If you’re shameless enough to offer, I’m not shameless enough to accept. I wouldn’t want to embarrass your Wenqing Sect.”

“Don’t tell me… you want a billion?” Feng Xuan’s head buzzed, nearly coughing up blood in anger.

“Ten billion Middle-Level Source Crystals isn’t much for Wenqing Sect, is it?” Yang Kai grinned.

“Middle-Level Source Crystals?” Feng Xuan’s mouth twitched. He’d thought Yang Kai wanted ten billion Lower-Level Source Crystals, but it turned out to be Middle-Level—there’s a hundredfold difference! Even if converted to Upper-Level Source Crystals, that’s still ten million. He immediately roared, “You little bastard, so you’re just making a fool of this Lord! You never intended to return it. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of your elders, so you know who you can’t afford to offend!”

Earlier, he hadn’t wanted to deal with Yang Kai personally, mainly because of his status. With so many people watching, a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert attacking a junior at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm would look bad.

But now, after Yang Kai’s endless provocation, Feng Xuan was driven mad with rage. He no longer cared. Even if he killed Yang Kai now, no one would think he was bullying the weak—after all, this youth’s behavior was truly infuriating.

As he spoke, he struck out at Yang Kai from a distance. In an instant, the world changed color. Laws surged.

The entire Binglun City seemed to be enveloped by the might of that palm. Everyone felt suffocated, their hearts heavy.

Hu Yuan and the others all turned pale and retreated, secretly feeling sorry for Yang Kai. This brat really didn’t know his limits, provoking a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm again and again—he must have a death wish.

Everyone could almost foresee the scene of him dying on the spot.

Feng Xuan’s attack came without warning. By the time the women of Ice Heart Valley reacted to help, it was already too late.

Yang Kai was also pinned in place by the force of that Imperial Might, unable to move, his face pale. Yet he showed no fear at all—instead, he looked at Feng Xuan with a leisurely, mocking gaze.

Hiss—

With a soft sound, a snow-white sword light suddenly shot out from somewhere in the inn, heading straight for Feng Xuan’s descending palm, its momentum unstoppable.

Immediately after, a deafening boom rang out. A massive shockwave spread in all directions, causing buildings within a thousand zhang to sway violently.

The palm print vanished in an instant, while the towering sword energy shot straight into the sky, disappearing in a flash.

When everyone came to their senses, they found a young girl standing beside Yang Kai. She looked about seventeen or eighteen, her aura pure and untouched by the slightest speck of dust.

Feng Xuan’s eyes narrowed, his gaze instantly locking onto the girl.

An Ruoyun and the others also widened their beautiful eyes in surprise and excitement, looking at her and trembling as they called out, “Master!”

Master?

The onlookers, including Hu Yuan, immediately realized who this girl was. She was clearly the founder of Ice Heart Valley, the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert who had been missing for three thousand years—Bing Yun!

“Disciple greets Master!” An Ruoyun and the others all knelt down.

Bing Yun glanced at them indifferently, her thoughts unreadable. She didn’t respond, but instead turned her beautiful eyes to Yang Kai, snorted, and said softly, “You’re far too bold.”

She was obviously referring to Yang Kai’s repeated provocations toward Feng Xuan just now.

Bing Yun had lived for tens of thousands of years, but in all that time, she’d never seen anyone as audacious as Yang Kai. A mere Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm dared to bargain and shout at a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm.

“Heh heh!” Yang Kai grinned cheekily. “With Senior right behind me, what do I have to fear?” He paused, then asked nervously, “Senior, how’s your recovery?”

Bing Yun replied softly, “Almost fully recovered.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel relieved. If Bing Yun said she was almost recovered, then she must be fully restored. In other words, she could fight now. As long as she could act, Feng Xuan was nothing to fear.

“Bing Yun, what’s the meaning of this?” Feng Xuan looked at her coldly and shouted, “If I remember correctly, Ice Heart Valley doesn’t accept male disciples. Why are you stopping this Lord from teaching that brat a lesson?”

Bing Yun glanced at him and said, “Wait a moment. I’ll deal with matters in the Valley first, then I’ll argue with you!”

Feng Xuan’s expression froze, but he couldn’t refute her. In the entire Star Domain, there weren’t many qualified to speak to him like this, but Bing Yun was definitely one of them. The two had clashed countless times, always evenly matched. Feng Xuan was wary of her, so even though he felt constrained, he had to give her face.

Bing Yun turned around and looked at An Ruoyun and the others, saying calmly, “Get up. Why are you still kneeling?”

An Ruoyun and the others kept their heads down, but none of them stood up.

Bing Yun snorted coldly, “I’ve been gone for three thousand years and my words no longer carry weight, is that it? No wonder you dared to marry off the Valley’s best disciple. When did my Ice Heart Valley fall so low as to act according to others’ whims? You little girls are truly something!”

From her tone, it was clear she knew the whole story—she must have overheard the conversation outside just now.

An Ruoyun trembled, knowing her Master was truly angry. She said in fear, “We have failed your teachings, Master. Please punish us!”

Sun Yunxiu hurriedly said, “Master, this has nothing to do with the other sisters. The marriage with Wenqing Sect was my decision. If you must punish someone, punish me alone.”

“You think I don’t dare?” Bing Yun shot Sun Yunxiu a cold look. Sun Yunxiu, a Second Stage of the Emperor Realm expert, trembled like a mouse before a cat under that gaze, gritting her teeth and saying nothing.

At that moment, Zi Yu said, “Ancestor, please calm your anger. The Great Elder did it for the sake of the Sect. Please forgive her.”

That she would speak up for Sun Yunxiu was truly surprising—even Sun Yunxiu herself seemed taken aback, her beautiful eyes turning complicated.

Bing Yun’s gaze softened as she looked at Zi Yu. “You really are a soft-hearted girl. Even now, you’re still speaking up for those who would throw you into the fire. Have you thought about who it was that tried to push you into this pit?”

Zi Yu shook her head. “The Great Elder had no choice. If she hadn’t done it, the other sisters in the Valley would have had no way out. If sacrificing my own happiness could keep them safe, I’d do it. I just… I just wanted to run away, as far as possible… It’s my own immaturity, Ancestor, please don’t blame the others.” As she spoke, tears streamed down her face, clearly full of bitterness.

Bing Yun opened her mouth but couldn’t say anything. She sighed heavily. “Don’t worry. With me here, no one will dare touch you!”

Zi Yu broke into a smile through her tears. “Thank you, Ancestor!”

Bing Yun’s words were like a calming pill, instantly putting her at ease. She no longer felt any of her previous fear or anxiety.

Bing Yun looked at Sun Yunxiu again and said, “Your punishment will be decided after I return to the Valley. For now, all of you, get up!”

“Thank you, Master!” the women responded in unison, finally standing up.

Bing Yun’s gaze softened as she looked over their faces. She found that nearly half of these dozen or so Emperor Realm women were her own disciples from years ago, now all at the Emperor Realm. Some looked familiar—likely outstanding talents from the Sect, not her direct disciples but among the first batch of Ice Heart Valley’s disciples. Only two or three Emperor Realm women were strangers to her.

Those two or three must have been recruited by An Ruoyun and the others after she left Ice Heart Valley.

Some martial artists who cultivate alone without any backing, with heaven-defying opportunities, can reach extremely high levels in the Martial Dao. Such people are highly sought after by the major Sects, because if they can reach such heights without support or resources, then with a little help, they have a great chance of advancing to the Emperor Realm.

Take Yang Kai, for example.

If these people want to join a major Sect, they only need to pass some simple tests and checks to enter. Of course, even after joining, there’s a long period of observation to ensure they have no ulterior motives before being entrusted with important responsibilities.

Bing Yun looked at the unfamiliar Emperor Realm women—these must have been recruited into Ice Heart Valley through such means. Since they were standing here now, it meant their loyalty was beyond doubt.

“Where are Little Three, Little Five, and Little Nine?” Bing Yun suddenly asked, as if sensing something. Her expression grew a bit dim.

An Ruoyun quickly replied, “Third Junior Sister left to search for you not long after you disappeared from Ice Heart Valley. She’s still missing to this day.”
