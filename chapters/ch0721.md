## Chapter 721 — An Unexpected Clue

After a long while, Yang Kai's eyes suddenly cleared; a pensive light flickered across his face. He reached out and summoned his alchemical furnace, then took several medicinal ingredients from the Black Book Space.

The Divine Sense Fire erupted, enveloping those ingredients. Under the roasting heat, they were swiftly condensed into medicinal liquids, which were methodically poured into the furnace.

The Divine Sense Fire then wrapped around the furnace itself, and the liquids within underwent a pleasing process of transformation and fusion.

In just a short time, a fresh medicinal aroma spread throughout the side chamber.

With a light sound, a perfectly round pill shot out of the furnace. Yang Kai snatched it up, examined it closely, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

A Spirit-Grade Pill! It had been refined with ease. Compared to refining pills using True Yuan, this method was far quicker and more convenient, cutting the time required by a large margin. Yang Kai could also sense that if he became skillful and practiced in the use of Divine Sense Fire, the pills he produced would be of very high quality.

Refining pills with Divine Sense Fire and refining them with True Yuan were not on the same level at all.

Throughout the whole process, Elder Li and Zhai Yao watched with complete attention.

Zhai Yao clicked his tongue in astonishment. Even though he had seen his teacher use Divine Sense Fire countless times, he could not help but be amazed—unable to hide his envy of Yang Kai's advantage, which he himself lacked.

Elder Li nodded in approval, his eyes bright. Yang Kai's comprehension and natural aptitude made him feel that his teachings had not been in vain.

He was certain Yang Kai would thoroughly ingest his experience and, on that foundation, develop his own insights and progress.

"Thank you for your guidance, Elder Li," Yang Kai said, pocketing the spirit pill and cupping his fist in a solemn salute.

Elder Li smiled slightly. "Heh heh, young brother, you're too courteous. When I teach you these things, there are conditions attached."

"Please speak, Elder Li," Yang Kai replied.

Elder Li asked, "I wish to ask how your Divine Sense Fire was born. From what I observed, its strength seems not inferior to mine, especially for someone of your age. I find it hard to imagine you refining your Divine Sense Fire to such a degree on your own. If it is convenient, could you tell me?"

Yang Kai hesitated slightly before answering, "Well, regarding the first question, it actually appeared unintentionally. I once had a True Spirit contained in a piece of jade; I intended to devour the True Spirit's energy to strengthen my cultivation and combat ability. But accidentally, during that cultivation session, I produced the Divine Sense Fire."

"A True Spirit within a jade?" Elder Li's expression changed. "You had the nerve to devour something like that."

"I didn't think much at the time. Thinking back now, it was indeed quite dangerous," Yang Kai said with a grin. "Fortunately, that True Spirit wasn't too powerful, otherwise I would have handed over my life."

Elder Li nodded, then pondered. "So devouring a True Spirit can give rise to Divine Sense Fire. Still, that method is rather reckless."

His questioning was clearly for Zhai Yao's sake—he hoped to let Zhai Yao obtain Divine Sense Fire as well. Yang Kai's method, however, was not suitable for Zhai Yao.

Aside from the danger, even if it were safe it might not produce Divine Sense Fire for Zhai Yao; it relied too heavily on coincidence.

"As for the second question…" Yang Kai said slowly, "the reason my Divine Sense Fire can rival Elder Li's is probably because I devoured other people's Divine Sense Fire. It wasn't cultivated purely through my own effort."

Elder Li's face changed dramatically. "You devoured other people's Divine Sense Fire?"

"You misunderstand, Elder Li. I didn't take it by force. It was at a certain place where many warriors possessing Divine Sense Fire had died; their soul energies were left behind, and I happened to be able to devour them," Yang Kai explained.

"Your luck makes one green with envy!" Zhai Yao exclaimed, thoroughly envious.

Throughout the world, those with mutated Divine Sense were indeed rare, but a few existed. One could say that advanced alchemists who possessed Divine Sense Fire were probably only Yang Kai and Elder Li.

Perhaps there were others with Divine Sense Fire, but they were not adept at alchemy and could only use it for combat.

"I understand," Elder Li said with a slight nod. "Thank you, young brother, for clearing this up for me. It has been of great help."

"Elder Li, you flatter me; I have also benefited greatly from you," Yang Kai hurried to reply. After a moment's thought, he asked, "Senior, didn't you have something else you meant to tell me earlier?"

Earlier Elder Li had guessed that Yang Kai had joined the Tianxiao Sect not long ago but had not revealed why, which had piqued Yang Kai's curiosity.

A man like Elder Li would not speak carelessly; if he had done so, there must be some deeper meaning.

"Yes, this matter may or may not concern you," Elder Li chuckled, producing a Spirit-Grade Pill and handing it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it, looked it over carefully, and exclaimed in surprise, "Isn't this the Spirit-Grade Pill I refined?"

This spirit pill was precisely the one he had refined at the inn when he had competed with Zhai Yao; it even bore visible pill patterns.

"If it's convenient, could you carve the spirit formation used to refine this Spirit-Grade Pill for me?" Elder Li asked kindly. "Don't worry, I do not seek to pry into your studies; I merely have a question."

"No inconvenience at all," Yang Kai said with a light laugh. He trusted someone like Elder Li. He circulated his True Yuan and replicated the spirit formation he had used earlier inside the alchemical furnace.

Very soon the spirit formation was fully inscribed, and Yang Kai passed the furnace over.

Elder Li took it and examined it, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. He casually passed the furnace to Zhai Yao. "You take a look."

Zhai Yao took it with a baffled expression and examined it. After a moment he let out a soft "eh," as if he had discovered something interesting.

"What's the matter?" Yang Kai asked, confused by the two of them.

"Interesting," Zhai Yao said with a smile as he sized Yang Kai up. "The spirit formation you used differs subtly from the one we currently use; it seems to be a very ancient technique."

Elder Li nodded slightly. "Indeed, it is a very ancient spirit formation, a lost method. Compared to the spirit formations we use now, it is unquestionably more effective."

"I learned it from a very ancient tome," Yang Kai explained. "Elder Li, if you wish, I can copy down all the spirit formations I know."

Elder Li chuckled. "No need. I didn't ask you because I covet your knowledge; it's because Yao and I have seen this kind of spirit formation before, so I thought it might be related to you."

Yang Kai's brow tightened. "Please tell me everything!"

"Brother Yang, it's like this," Zhai Yao took up the tale. "Since I was young I've trained in the mountains with my teacher, learning the way of alchemy for twenty years. A few years ago my master decided it was time to go out into the world to gain experience. I always considered my level unbeatable among peers, but in Fuyun City I was defeated by you… and before that I had been defeated by someone else, two years ago!"

Yang Kai was jolted. "There is someone more skilled than you at alchemy?"

"Yes, and what frustrated me most was that person was a woman!" Zhai Yao said with a grin as he looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was stunned, suddenly remembering something. His eyes brightened and he asked eagerly, "What kind of woman was she?"

"I don't know," Zhai Yao replied. "She wore a veil over her face, with a blue sapphire adorning her forehead. Her eyes were bright and clear—she must have been a beauty, with a somewhat innocent charm."

Yang Kai's breathing grew rapid and his voice trembled, "Was there a lecherous old fellow by her side?"

"Lecherous?" Zhai Yao looked blank. "Probably — anyway, that old man had a shameless air that wasn't becoming of his age."

"Did that old fellow's surname happen to be Meng?" Yang Kai asked, drawing a deep breath.

"It indeed appears to have something to do with you," Elder Li said, nodding gently. "When I saw traces of the spirit formation used in that Spirit-Grade Pill earlier, I had my suspicions but couldn't be certain. Now it seems you and that girl share the same origin; after all, the spirit formations you used are identical."

"Yes, she is my Senior Sister!" Yang Kai nodded firmly.

It could be no one else. The person who defeated Zhai Yao two years ago must have been Xia Ningshang — no other person in the world could have done it.

"Which sect are you from that you're all so formidable?" Zhai Yao said, speechless. "That woman aside, she seems to have a fundamentally different constitution; she doesn't even need a furnace to refine pills—she gathers Spiritual Qi and can refine at will, crafting pill patterns effortlessly. I faced her three times and was utterly defeated, wounded in spirit. And you, you go even further, possessing Divine Sense Fire—there's just no comparison between you and your Senior Sister."

"She truly has a special constitution, born for alchemy," Yang Kai said, nodding, his heart surging with excitement. After searching so long, he had finally found a useful clue.

"The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body!" Elder Li suddenly exclaimed. "No wonder… she possesses the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body! Given time, her achievements will surely surpass mine. That old bastard Meng Wuya has been so secretive and wouldn't tell me."

Yang Kai's expression shifted. From the way Elder Li addressed Meng Wuya, it seemed the two were old acquaintances of the same generation.

"When you encountered them, did you see anyone else? I have another Senior Sister and a friend who were following them," Yang Kai asked.

"You don't mean that they were also expert alchemists, do you?" Zhai Yao asked with a sour look.

"No," Yang Kai shook his head.

"I did not see them," Zhai Yao replied. "Meng Wuya appeared to have brought only that Miss Xia."

Yang Kai's face darkened and anxiety rose in his chest.

Meng Wuya brought Xia Ningshang—then what of Su Yan? What of Di Mo? Where had the two of them gone?

He was not worried for Di Mo; he is originally from Tongxuan Continent and has occupied the body of a demon general. Aside from Saint Realm experts, few could harm him. But Su Yan is different—she is a lone woman, not particularly strong, and a stunning beauty. What would happen if she encountered danger?

Why had she separated from Meng Wuya? Or had some accident befallen her?

Yang Kai's heart instantly dropped to the bottom of a valley, and he could not help but brood wildly.
