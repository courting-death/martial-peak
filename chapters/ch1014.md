## Chapter 1014 — The Irascible Ghost Ancestor

Inside the cave, stalactites hung upside down, and a clear spring, filled with Spiritual Qi, fell from those stone formations, splashing onto the ground with crisp, tinkling sounds.

The entire cavern was wreathed in mist; the Spiritual Qi was so dense it seemed impossible to part.

Yang Kai sat cross‑legged inside, every pore of his body dilated, ravenously swallowing the mistlike Spiritual Qi, slowly, almost imperceptibly, increasing his strength.

Before setting out for the Starry Sky, Yang Kai had only just broken into the Saint Realm.

He wandered through the Starry Void for many days but couldn't find a place to settle and had no time to cultivate.

Then he encountered people from Purple Star and was captured onto a warship, leaving him even less chance to train.

Before he had time to escape, he and those from Purple Star fell into misfortune and were drawn to this Floating Continent, his cultivation sealed for two whole months.

Now that he had regained a bit of freedom, Yang Kai naturally made haste to make use of it.

Only with great strength would any possibility open up; even in the most desperate adversity he had never entertained thoughts of giving up.

The cave's terrain had been artificially altered to let Spiritual Qi converge and surge here more rapidly, maximizing what he could absorb and use.

His realm and cultivation were slowly increasing.

When he grew weary of cultivation, he would casually refine a few Pills to lift his spirits, or go out for a walk to behold the Floating Continent's scenery, searching cliff fissures and forests for one high‑grade medicinal herb after another.

Shen Tu was right: this damned place harbored astonishing resources — Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine were virtually everywhere, each specimen richly aged and potent.

Any Pill refiner who came here would likely go mad with joy and have their heart overwhelmed with excitement.

The Saint Pills Yang Kai crafted were used to assist his training; each Saint Pill he took into his belly pushed his cultivation speed almost to its limit.

His cultivation now was no longer merely an agglomeration of power.

At this level, every advancement required simultaneous strengthening of both power and realm.

That power included both the body and Divine Sense; realm encompassed mental state and comprehension of the Martial and Heavenly Dao — any deficiency would doom progress.

Yang Kai cultivated smoothly, with everything going his way; there was no such thing as a bottleneck for him.

Days passed, and in this exceptional environment Yang Kai grew at lightning speed, faintly sensing the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

He estimated it had been nearly a year since he parted from Shen Tu.

He had not met anyone in so long nor exchanged words with anyone, yet Yang Kai could subtly perceive changes on this continent.

Fighters from Purple Star and the Sword Alliance seemed to be fewer every few days; their auras suddenly vanished from the land — Yang Kai knew full well what had befallen them.

They must have been thrown into that spatial formation by the Ghost Ancestor with no return.

In the beginning he could sense scattered martial presences nearby with his Divine Sense, but in the past half year no one had come near.

It seemed the entire continent had been left with only him; no one else remained!

One day, while Yang Kai was meditating, his expression changed; he opened his eyes and looked intently in a certain direction.

Over there, a sinister and ghastly aura erupted like an explosion, sweeping across half the continent in an instant. Even though he was tens of thousands of li away, Yang Kai couldn’t help but tremble slightly, hastily circulating his True Yang Yuan Qi to resist the chill seeping into his body.

At the same time, he keenly sensed the plants outside his cave rapidly withering, and the land growing dead and lifeless in that moment.

The Ghost Ancestor's roar thundered through the skies: “Why! Why is it still unsuccessful? I have painstakingly researched for a thousand years — why can't I leave this damned place!”

His voice was hysterical.

When he grew angry, the whole continent's clouds and colors changed.

Yang Kai immediately realized that after so long, the Ghost Ancestor still had made no progress with the spatial formation; the hopes he had seen before had turned to despair in that instant.

Yang Kai held his breath and remained motionless.

“You brat, come over here!” Suddenly the Ghost Ancestor's voice sounded in his ear.

Yang Kai’s face twisted bitterly. He knew that if it was a blessing, it wouldn’t be a disaster—and if it was a disaster, there was no avoiding it. Resigned, he stood up and walked out of the cave, then controlled his Star Shuttle to fly toward the mountain where the Ghost Ancestor resided.

An hour later, he arrived halfway up the mountain and descended.

Scanning the scene, Yang Kai sighed heavily: where there had once been nearly a hundred fighters, now fewer than ten remained. The others had long since vanished.

Of those ten, a large portion were people he recognized.

Yue Xi of the Sword Alliance, and the two sisters He Zao and Xiu Li.

Lü Guichen of Purple Star, and Bi Ya.

And Shen Tu.

Liu Shan was nowhere to be seen; likely fate had not been kind to him.

Seeing Yang Kai appear, the group all looked up at him. A gloomy, oppressive atmosphere hung over them, so heavy that none dared even breathe too loudly.

This reunion of the stranded was completely different from the last: then they were fearful but still clung to hope of escape and freedom from the Ghost Ancestor's control; now every one of them sat in dejection, their eyes dim, not a hint of light.

They were like prisoners waiting for death.

Shen Tu nodded lightly to Yang Kai in greeting, but had no spirit to say more.

“You're living quite comfortably, brat,” the Ghost Ancestor sneered as he stood in the center of the spatial formation and looked coldly at Yang Kai.

“Senior, I have been very obedient lately, staying secluded and avoiding trouble,” Yang Kai said with a twitch at the corner of his mouth; he did not understand why the old fiend kept targeting him.

“I know! Your every movement cannot hide from my detection; of course I know you're honest and proper!” the Ghost Ancestor chuckled. “But it's precisely because of that that I am unhappy! Why do you seem so unconcerned about whether you can leave this damned place?”

Yang Kai instantly understood where the problem lay.

It was because he was too honest and proper that he was singled out. The others fretted day after day; Yang Kai behaved as though nothing was wrong — clearly different from the rest.

“I am naturally worried, but such matters can be left to you, Senior. My strength is low, my insight limited; I cannot think of a good way to leave here.”

“Spare me the flattery!” the Ghost Ancestor's face turned cold. “If you said a few pleasing words before I might have been amused, but now… humph, I won't fall for it!”

Yang Kai fell silent.

Yue Xi, Lü Guichen and the others all looked anxious, listening with bated breath to Yang Kai's exchange with the Ghost Ancestor, secretly praying Yang Kai would not anger the Ghost Ancestor further.

The Ghost Ancestor staggered; he seemed somewhat exhausted, his eyes sunken and the sockets blackened.

A strange expression crossed his face, half like muttering to himself and half like recounting to the crowd: “When I was young I encountered a rare opportunity and cultivated an evil power, gradually rising to the Saint King Realm while still but a hundred years old. In my prime I have acted without restraint and made my name known across the Star Domain. But enemies sought vengeance; overnight my wife and children were taken, my household destroyed. I did not die but fled grievously wounded, hiding away into the Chaos Abyss where I lost my way. Not long after, a burst of a chaotic domain field dragged me into this continent. This place is rich and its Spiritual Qi dense; I thought heaven had granted me a chance to grow mighty here and then go out to exact revenge upon my foes!”

He continued, his face growing more ferocious: “Yet I have now reached the Void King Realm and this damned place still binds me like a cage, preventing me from leaving. What good is boundless power if I cannot depart?”

“I will seek revenge and slay that man to avenge my wife and children,” he roared at the crowd.

“Senior, two thousand years may have passed; your enemy might already be dead,” Yang Kai frowned.

“Then I will slaughter his descendants for ten thousand generations, eradicate his bloodline from the world; anyone connected to him I will wipe out, and I will raze the star he dwells on, turning it into a dead star!” the Ghost Ancestor raved, ghostly qi swirling about him, terrifying to behold.

“Do you all understand my obsession?” He abruptly turned his head to the people.

Everyone nodded together, none daring to show defiance.

“Good, you understand,” the Ghost Ancestor grinned wickedly and ordered in a low voice, “Then help me one last time; after this I will not trouble you again.”

Unease settled heavily in everyone's hearts.

The Ghost Ancestor paid no heed to their thoughts and busied himself adjusting the spatial formation, saying as he reconfigured it: “Your arrival has afforded me many trials. I am not well versed in the mysteries of space, so this Void Passage has been unstable. I don't know precisely where it will transport you. This time you are on your own — whether you live or die depends on fate.”

As he spoke, the formation was completed; at the doorway covered in thin Ethereal Crystal, the Void Passage opened once more. He beckoned to Yang Kai: “Brat, come over!”

“Me again?” Yang Kai was furious.

The last time the Ghost Ancestor summoned everyone he picked Yang Kai first; this time was no different. He really couldn't fathom what he had done to offend the old devil so.

“Enough excuses!” the Ghost Ancestor cut him off, a skeletal hand reaching out to seize Yang Kai and drag him forward.

“Senior, is this fair to him? You sent him last time already; this time you should pick someone else,” a voice suddenly spoke up.

The Ghost Ancestor, about to throw Yang Kai into the Void Passage, glanced to the side and saw He Zao's pale face looking towards them.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he had not expected her to speak a good word for him at this last moment.

“Yes, Senior, you are singling out Brother Yang too much.” Shen Tu, after a brief hesitation, mustered courage to speak in agreement.

He Miao's beautiful eyes flickered and she nodded nervously, wearing an expression of wholehearted approval.
