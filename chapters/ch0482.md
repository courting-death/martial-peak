## Chapter 482 — A Blessing in Disguise

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, sensing the scrutiny but said nothing, only stating, “I’m not clear on his origins.”

“Not clear?” Yang Liting frowned, displeased. Though suspecting Yang Kai was deliberately withholding something, his careful observation revealed no sign of deceit.

Yang Kai truly did not know the Earth Demon’s backstory. When he tamed the Earth Demon in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, it was merely a spiritual entity with chaotic, unclear memories who couldn't even recall its own name. Over time, Yang Kai never pressed him about his past. Naturally, he was ignorant of the Earth Demon’s true background.

“Though unclear, I can assure you he’s not from the Cangyun Evil Land,” Yang Kai quickly added, aware of Yang Liting’s concerns.

Yang Liting showed little reaction but continued frowning. After a long pause, he said, “The succession war should, in principle, allow anyone in the world to participate. Any friends you young people know may join, as it tests your networks. Since he is connected to your circle, if I were to expel him from the War City or kill him outright, you might begrudge me, and that would be tantamount to suppressing you, which goes against our purpose here on the battlefield.”

A chill swept through Yang Kai’s heart, though his expression remained impassive.

“This summons wasn’t for anything else. He may participate in the succession war and remain in War City—but only within these limits. If I discover him causing trouble, I won’t show mercy. Make sure to explain this to him,” Yang Liting said coldly. “Furthermore, once the succession war concludes, he must leave immediately. Don’t blame me for showing no leniency.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai replied flatly.

Though still young with a promising future, potentially one day able to command the heavens and rend the sky with one hand, he was currently a small player. To defy Yang Liting would bring no good outcome.

Though Yang Liting was the Grand Elder of the Yang Family and Yang Kai was nominally his disciple descendant, this encounter felt like strangers, and Yang Liting’s warning bore an unmistakable tone of finality.

“Go now.” Yang Liting waved his hand and turned to fly up into the sky, engaging those seven others in battle.

Feeling inexplicably stifled, Yang Kai’s heart was heavy; he wanted to leave but didn’t know how. He didn’t even know how he had entered here.

After standing there long and finding no exit, about to ask, a thunderous voice suddenly sounded: “Not leaving yet?”

As soon as the voice reached him, a tremendous force pushed Yang Kai backward so powerfully that all resistance was futile. His figure retreated rapidly, the scenery flashing past his view.

In a blink, he was back in the hall, facing the same round platform. Eight figures of Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm sat above it. The enormous luminous orb in the middle still existed, with the eight continuously pouring energy into it, using that mysterious method to refine their comprehension of Martial Arts.

Stumbling backward, Yang Kai nearly fell, but Ying Jiu caught him, alarmed.

Once steady, his True Essence churned wildly, and his Divine Sense was chaotic, prickling painfully like needles.

Spitting a mouthful of blood, he finally felt some relief.

Ying Jiu’s expression changed. He didn’t understand what had happened to Yang Kai but saw that he had sustained some minor injuries.

Since arriving here, Yang Kai had said nothing; Ying Jiu was at a loss to speak and merely waited silently. Such a sudden turn of events left him baffled.

“We must go!” Yang Kai wiped his mouth, glanced briefly at the platform, and quickly departed with Ying Jiu.

In that strange little world, the eight ceased their fierce clash. The seven elders who had not spoken before exchanged glances, and the slightly plump elder said, “Brother Yang, treating a junior this way is a bit excessive, isn’t it?”

“Yes, though his gaze was somewhat fierce and overbearing, young people are all impetuous. Besides, he didn’t lose his temper in front of you.”

“This kind of treatment might cause him to collapse completely. That boy is quite talented. The Yang Family may need to rely on him in the future. Wouldn’t it pain you to lose him?”

The seven elders chattered loudly, baffled by Yang Liting’s harsh treatment of a junior disciple.

Yang Liting snorted coldly, “If he’s worthless, then let him be. Does the Yang Family fear no successors? When I spoke to him earlier, he seemed unwilling to listen; that was merely a warning. I expect he now takes my words to heart.”

“That’s going too far. Brother Yang, you’re not young anymore. Why bother with children?”

“This time you really went too far. The fact he could penetrate our consciousness, all eight of us, speaks volumes about his unique talent. Does anyone else in the Yang Family have such ability? I don’t believe it. In fact, among the younger generation across the seven families, no one else can do it,” another elder shook his head.

“That’s enough! I act with discretion, and I won’t allow you to interfere. Are we fighting or not?” Yang Liting’s displeasure was clear as seven elders rebuked him.

“Fight! When this kid fails, I’ll be here to see you regret it!” they laughed.

“Wait... something’s wrong!” Suddenly, Elder Qiu Daoist of the Qiu Family exclaimed, his face turning strange.

The others exchanged suspicious looks.

“Looks like this boy has found a blessing in disguise,” the plump elder laughed, glancing meaningfully at Yang Liting.

“Truly a blessing in disguise.”

“Brother Yang, could this have been your true intention?”

Yang Liting slowly shook his head, showing some movement in expression as he sensed something. His harsh approach wasn’t just carelessness regarding their power and rank difference but designed to force Yang Kai to seriously reflect on whether associating with demons was wise.

Unexpectedly, under that immense pressure, the young man showed signs of breaking through.

Curious, Yang Liting furrowed his brow, wondering what kind of character his disciple had. After such a blow, he had quickly cleared his mental obstacles and sought the thread of breakthrough.

In Fengshen Hall, Yang Kai suddenly halted, his face strained and unsettled.

Ying Jiu, concerned, thought Yang Kai might have a hidden injury and hurried to ask.

Yang Kai waved him off. “Go tell Qiu Yimeng that tomorrow night’s operation proceeds as planned. She will coordinate everything.”

“Young Master, you—”

“I have some matters to attend to.” Yang Kai glanced around before casually entering an empty room.

Ying Jiu was stunned, hesitated briefly, then left Fengshen Hall.

Fengshen Hall was spacious, but only eight people resided within—no servants or attendants as these beyond Divine Roaming Realm practitioners required none.

The room Yang Kai entered was unoccupied.

Once inside, he immediately sat cross-legged.

His Qi flow fluctuated; indeed, he was on the verge of breakthrough but hadn’t reached the limit yet. If conditions matured naturally, the process would be smooth and effortless.

However, Yang Kai’s condition was unique. He had no prior signs of breakthrough, only the rebound from Yang Liting’s immense pressure and his own yearning for strength.

This rebound brought him to the threshold of the Ninth Stage of the True Essence Realm.

Just a fraction away.

With the great battle looming tomorrow night, Yang Kai hoped to face it with higher cultivation.

Quieting his mind, he activated the True Yang Technique, closed his eyes, and recalled the scenes he had just witnessed in the small world, letting his Qi flow.

Though Yang Kai had seen little, every movement of those eight Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm figures conformed to the Way of Heaven. To probe their subtle meanings was to grasp their Martial Arts comprehension.

This would greatly benefit anyone.

As time passed, Yang Kai’s mood steadily calmed. He replayed what he had observed again and again. The mysterious sounds rang again in his ears.

The mountain stream's crystal-clear water sparkled pleasingly, bird and flower scents filled the air, as if in a fairyland, enchanting and relaxing.

...

In Yang Kai’s residence.

A candle flickered, and Qiu Yimeng wore deep concern on her face. Resting her chin on her hand beside a table, she held her breath and listened intently to sounds within the house. Though not strong, her Divine Sense constantly scouted.

Whenever footsteps sounded, her beautiful eyes lit up with hope, but every time ended in disappointment.

During the day, Yang Kai had told her about the evening’s operation and plan. She had clung to him, disregarding etiquette, but that damned man had shown no kindness and shook her off.

As expected, he snuck away quietly at night, leaving her anxious and uneasy.

Her heart filled with hidden resentment—she half hoped Yang Kai wouldn’t return tonight!

Her current demeanor was no different from a married woman whose husband caroused and didn’t return home. Thinking this made her blush and slightly warm. Hastily, she shook her head, tossing away these wild thoughts.

Suddenly, a steady knocking sounded at the door. Qiu Yimeng frowned, coldly calling, “Who is it?”

“Miss Qiu,” Ying Jiu’s voice came from outside.

Qiu Yimeng’s expression brightened. She quickly rose and opened the door, only to see Ying Jiu’s glowing eyes in the dark. She suspiciously glanced behind him and asked sternly, “Has that bastard returned?”

Ying Jiu slowly shook his head.

“What happened?” The young lady’s face changed drastically.

Ying Jiu had never left Yang Kai’s side before, yet now he came alone. Yang Kai was nowhere to be found. Could it be...

Qiu Yimeng dared not think further.
