## Chapter 1094 — Who Is to Be Pitied

The Saint Yuan within his body was indeed utterly depleted; the strength he had painstakingly accumulated over so many years had been drained clean, which was enough to make one panic, but his foundation remained. Yang Kai tried circulating his cultivation and found he could still draw Spiritual Qi from the heavens and earth, transforming it into powerful nourishment for himself.

As long as the foundation remained, restoring his strength was only a matter of time. With the aid of Pills and Saint Crystals, that time would not be long—at most a few days—but to once again possess the inexhaustible, bottomless reserves he had before would require years of steady accumulation.

His Divine Sense had not suffered much loss; on the contrary, it had grown noticeably stronger.

Probing within his body with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai quickly grew elated.

The golden blood flowing inside him seemed purer and more refined.

And there were nearly a hundred drops — the purest, most authentic Demon God Golden Blood. Each drop of Demon God Golden Blood contained an extraordinarily terrifying power. This was true Demon God Golden Blood, blood comparable to that coursing through a Great Demon God. Compared with these hundred drops of golden blood, the blood that had flowed through his body before only possessed strong regenerative power.

Yet these hundred drops of golden blood seemed to contain Yang Kai’s insights into the Dao of war and the martial way, an understanding of various powers, as if they were endlessly versatile in application.

His earlier despondency and faint unease were instantly replaced by rapturous joy.

As for that Tempering Pool, he had no idea what it truly was, but Yang Kai was certain he must have triggered some taboo on that altar; it caused the entire pool to compress into a blood-red crystal. While drifting through the Starry Sky, his blood had continued to undergo powerful tempering, which explained the thrilling state he now found himself in.

The Saint Yuan would not vanish without reason; it had most likely fused into his blood, nourishing the birth of those hundred drops of golden blood.

With his blood refined and purified, Yang Kai believed that the burst of Qi and blood he could unleash in battle would be vigorous; the strength of his Qi and blood and his regenerative power were directly linked to his life force, meaning his recovery and life force were far more formidable than before.

To verify his conjecture, he gathered the little strength he had just regained and carved a long, deep wound into the flesh of his palm that reached to the bone.

Golden radiance flashed; not even a drop of blood seeped out, and that terrifying wound healed in the blink of an eye—before half a teacup’s time had passed there was no trace left and no scar remained on his palm.

Yang Kai drew in a deep breath, suppressing the excitement in his heart.

In the past, such an injury, though not grave and only a minor wound, would have taken at least an hour or two to fully heal; now, half a teacup of time was enough.

His regenerative power really had increased severalfold.

After checking his body and confirming the situation was merely temporary, Yang Kai relaxed. He produced a Saint Crystal, held it in his palm, circulated his cultivation to draw its power, then stuffed handfuls of Pills into his mouth to metabolize their effects, feeling his strength slowly accumulating and recovering. For a moment he felt as if he had been reborn.

The mark of the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid on his chest had long since vanished, from which he could infer he had been unconscious for quite some time; exactly how long he could not tell.

The woman had said they were near Dark Star, several years’ travel from Rainfall Star, which meant he might have been sealed away for years. During the time of his sealing, the energy in that blood-red crystal, combined with his Saint Yuan, had been tempering his blood. When the crystal’s energy and his Saint Yuan were exhausted, the altar seemed to have disappeared; when the crystal shattered, Yang Kai did not see any trace of the altar.

The heaven-and-earth treasures laid out on the altar had likely been transformed into nutrients and seeped into his blood as well.

Although this venture had been somewhat muddled, he had nonetheless obtained considerable benefit.

Yu Feng, though crude and brusque, was a straightforward sort and had really brought some food for Yang Kai. Yang Kai accepted it without ceremony and ate it clean, regaining some strength.

Even at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, a cultivator could go without food, but everyone still had appetites; and among what Yu Feng brought were items with restorative properties, which did him great good once consumed.

Through the whole night Yang Kai consumed three Upper-Level Saint Crystals; the Saint Yuan circulating in his meridians accumulated considerably, though it was incomparable to his peak days.

The next day footsteps sounded outside. The woman who had spoken to him before did not wait for a reply—she pushed open the door and strode in, followed by an obsequious fellow carrying a chair with a sycophantic grin as he set it down.

Wu Yi sat down and waved at the warrior, indicating he could leave.

The warrior hesitated and said, “Miss, is it safe for you to be alone with him?”

“What kind of problem?” Wu Yi glared at him displeased. “Or do you think you’re more capable than me and can protect my safety?”

The warrior’s face flushed with embarrassment; he stammered that he dared not and respectfully left, closing the door behind him.

Wu Yi glanced at Yang Kai, who was sitting on the floor leaning against the wall, and let out a soft laugh. “You’re alive?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded. He did not know what this woman would ask him. He could sense that the warriors on this warship bore him no ill will; Yu Feng’s earlier threats to kill him had only been the result of vigilance and suspicion.

“Look, you were drifting through the Starry Sky. If my men hadn’t rescued you this time, you might still be wandering out there; if you’d accidentally run into a formidable star beast, it could have swallowed you whole,” Wu Yi cooed in a gentle voice, speaking alarmingly; “If a star beast had swallowed you, it would have been tragic.”

Yang Kai saw her playing with a Spatial Ring as she spoke and knew exactly what she had in mind, and he smirked. “You saved my life; I should thank you properly. But I have nothing of value—the only Spatial Ring I owned was taken yesterday by that fellow Yu Feng…”

“So you’re willing to give the Spatial Ring as thanks?” Wu Yi exclaimed with delight. “Excellent. Then the ring and everything inside it are mine now. You can’t go back.”

“I don’t want it.” Yang Kai shook his head.

Only then did Wu Yi feel at ease. She emptied the Spatial Ring’s contents into her own ring, then tossed the now-empty ring back to Yang Kai.

“You really are wealthy—the ring contained five hundred Upper-Level Saint Crystals. Do you know such a sum easily draws attention? Fortunately you met my warship; had you encountered another, you might not even be alive now.”

“Is that considered wealthy?” Yang Kai pinched his nose.

“Isn’t it?” Wu Yi said, a little wistful. “True, people outside do possess many Saint Crystals, but Dark Star is different. There are only a few Saint Crystal mines, and they’re controlled by several great powers. Our clan can’t get more; we must risk our lives to venture to other mining stars to obtain them, and many people die each time.”

“You’re that poor?” Yang Kai was astonished. Since arriving in the Star Domain he had never worried about Saint Crystals. On the Floating Continent he had plundered people from Purple Star and the Sword Alliance and obtained many Saint Crystals. On Rainfall Star he had rifled the warehouses of a Hengluo Commerce Guild branch.

He truly did not know anyone would be moved by the thought of five hundred Upper-Level Saint Crystals, and judging by this woman’s bearing she did not seem to be of low status.

“You say you’re from Rainfall Star? As far as I know, that cultivation star is owned by a force called the Hengluo Commerce Guild, right?”

“Mm.”

“Is the Hengluo Commerce Guild large? Are there many experts? Is the strongest reach the Void King Realm? I heard they build palaces out of Saint Crystals and eat Pills like snacks—is that true?” Wu Yi’s rapid-fire questions left Yang Kai a little stunned.

He hesitated and asked, “You’ve never been out there?”

Wu Yi shook her head. “I can only operate near Dark Star. This place is too remote. I’ve heard the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s business spans the entire Star Domain, but Dark Star isn’t included. It’s maddening—they really look down on us.”

Hearing her, Yang Kai suddenly felt sorry for the woman; she clearly yearned for the outside world but was bound by unknown reasons.

“You think leaving is that easy?” Wu Yi rolled her eyes at him, overflowing with charm; Yang Kai couldn’t help but stare a little.

“Without a proper Star Chart, without a sturdy ship, without ample resources, how could we sustain years of travel? Few here can go out, and outsiders rarely come here—Dark Star is destined to be forgotten.”

Her words reminded Yang Kai of Tongxuan Continent.

The two had much in common: both were extremely remote, but Dark Star was plainly better than Tongxuan Continent. At least Dark Star knew of the Star Domain’s existence, whereas Tongxuan Continent was a completely closed world with no right even to explore the Star Domain.

In the vast Star Domain, places like Tongxuan Continent and Dark Star were by no means unique; it was likely that in unknown corners there were many such cultivation stars.

For a moment Yang Kai felt a kinship with the woman, and after pondering he said, “Actually your situation is far better than mine.”

“How is that better?” Wu Yi asked in puzzlement.

“Do you know where I came from? On my land the strongest were only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm…”

Wu Yi’s small mouth formed an O.

“Don’t believe me?” Yang Kai smiled. “But it’s true. We didn’t even know about Star Shuttles, ships, or that there were other cultivation stars in the Star Domain. We sat in a well and thought the Third Stage of the Saint Realm was the pinnacle of martial arts. If I hadn’t accidentally obtained a Star Shuttle, I would never have come to this wondrous world. Apart from me, no one from that land could enter the Star Domain; they remain ignorant on that continent.”

Wu Yi stared at Yang Kai for a long moment before saying, “You people are truly pitiful.”
