## Chapter 1050 — The Heart of Persuasion

For nearly two months, Yang Kai and Xue Yue had been hiding among various dead stars in the Ice-Cold Dead Domain. Whoever was behind the trap that blew up the Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship, Yang Kai had come to deeply appreciate his need for caution and prudence!

Warriors kept wandering through the Ice-Cold Dead Domain, searching for something, until a few days ago they gradually fell silent and all withdrew.

They spent two months confirming that not a single person survived that catastrophe.

“I feel like this incident was aimed at me……” On one dead star, Xue Yue said thoughtfully.

“I think so too.” Yang Kai nodded in agreement. If at the start neither of them knew whether the trap was aimed at Xue Yue or at the Guild's warship, now both had the same suspicion.

The trap was aimed at Xue Yue! They meant to have her perish within it.

“Oh?” Xue Yue smiled at Yang Kai, deliberately testing him: “Why do you think so? Tell me your reasoning; let's see if it matches mine.”

Yang Kai didn't keep it to himself and said: “Time. They spent far too long searching for survivors. There were no important people or valuables on that warship; if the trap had been set against the Guild, they wouldn't have needed so much time to search. Their extreme caution, searching for two consecutive months, can only prove that they're terrified, that they're afraid of someone who might retaliate against them. So this incident was probably aimed at you; the Guild's warship was merely implicated.”

Saying this, Yang Kai looked at Xue Yue with burning eyes.

Xue Yue's bright eyes gleamed, her red lips twitching: “Your thinking is very clear; I underestimated you.”

Yang Kai's guess was basically what she had in mind. She was surprised to find that Yang Kai was indeed someone who could be molded; smiling sweetly she said, “If one day the soul chain between us is undone, and I don't want to kill you, would you follow me?”

“You're trying to win me over?” Yang Kai looked at her oddly.

“Sort of, but it's very possible that the moment the soul chain is broken, I'll kill you!” Xue Yue said those chilling words in a soft, pliant voice, smiling as if there were nothing strange about it.

“No chance. I will not be bound by you. If that day ever comes, I'll take you out before you make a move!”

“Big talk!” Xue Yue pouted. “I'd like to see what ability you have that can kill me!”

“You'll see when the time comes.” Yang Kai climbed out from where he'd been staying, turned, half-bowed. He extended a hand in an inviting gesture: “But for now, shouldn't we leave this damned place?”

Xue Yue pursed her lips and smiled, her eyes curving like crescent moons. She climbed out as well, placing her jade hand into Yang Kai's palm and allowed him to activate the Star Shuttle to carry her off.

After two months both had their wounds healed; Xue Yue had also recovered to the peak of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Yet she still was willing to ride the same Star Shuttle as Yang Kai.

She enjoyed being cared for in that way.

She had to repeatedly warn herself deep inside, reminding herself that this was a side effect of the soul chain; in a normal state she would never feel anything for such a man, but now, any of his care warmed her body and soul.

The Star Shuttle streaked like a blade of light; before long the two had left that dead star.

In the starry sky, Yang Kai halted and asked: “Where should we go now? Back to Shuiyue Star?”

“No, returning is too far. The Ice-Cold Dead Domain is one and a half months of warship travel from Shuiyue Star, and by Star Shuttle it would take at least three months to get back! Let's go to Rainfall Star; Rainfall Star is closer, and I was supposed to go there anyway, it's just that being in this state now is a bit troublesome.”

“Fine!” Yang Kai had no objection; he was easygoing and had no particular destination.

“Let me think about where Rainfall Star is exactly. This damned Ice-Cold Dead Domain, you can't even see a trace of starlight, so it's hardly possible to orient yourself.” Xue Yue's brows knitted into a line as she looked around to steady her sense of direction; as she was protesting, Yang Kai had already guided the Star Shuttle to fly off in one direction.

“Do you know the way?” Xue Yue called anxiously. “If you don't know the way, it's easy to lose direction in the starry sky.”

“My Star Shuttle just happens to have a Star Chart to Rainfall Star,” Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

“That's great.” Xue Yue rejoiced, putting her worries aside.

The Star Charts in Yang Kai's Star Shuttle were all etched and stamped by himself; he had found the best route from the vast, complex Star Chart above the Sea of Consciousness. This was a good time to test whether they worked.

“What are you going to Rainfall Star for?” During the flight, Yang Kai couldn't hide his curiosity and asked.

“My father sent me there to handle some matters,” Xue Yue replied casually.

“What matter is so important that it requires you to go in person?”

“Don't ask so much……” Xue Yue's pretty face turned bitter. “I want to tell you, but you must understand—this is the Guild's secret and cannot be leaked. Don't put me in a difficult position, okay?”

She actually begged softly.

“Alright, alright, I won't ask!” Yang Kai's heart twisted; he felt overwhelmed.

One had to admit, when a woman like Xue Yue acted coquettishly, she was absolutely irresistible.

Yang Kai had thoroughly experienced her charm; spending these days with her felt like walking on thin ice—he had to constantly remind himself each day to avoid accidentally falling under her sway.

It was precisely because of this that he could remain sufficiently clear-headed and not be completely enslaved by the soul chain.

Yang Kai believed Xue Yue was likewise struggling to cope with the power of the soul chain. The two tacitly understood this and never spoke of it.

Perhaps feeling somewhat guilty about what had just happened, after flying a while she suddenly asked: “What attribute is your cultivation power? Is it Yang or Fire?”

That day when she had tangled with Yang Kai she learned something of his power, but wasn't clear on the specifics.

“Why do you ask that?” Yang Kai asked cautiously.

“I was thinking that, if you are willing, I can help you find a master to teach you how to cultivate and how to use your power—to perceive the true essence of your strength,” Xue Yue said earnestly. “On the path of cultivation, having a teacher and having none is completely different. Since you are the first from your continent to rush into the Star Domain, no one before could have taught you this, right?”

“Find a master?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

“Yes, the Guild has many devotees well-versed in the truths of various powers. Finding an expert whose attribute matches yours is not difficult. Don't look down on me—I too have been taught by several masters……”

“Forget it; probably no one can teach me,” Yang Kai sneered, shaking his head.

“Don't be so quick to refuse; this would do you no harm.”

“Truly, no one can teach me. My power's attribute is rather peculiar!”

“Peculiar? How peculiar?” Now it was Xue Yue's turn to be astonished.

Yang Kai frowned; to cut short her wild imaginings he could only summon a mass of demonic flame.

That raging jet-black flame emitted a strange allure, like a blooming black rose. It seemed intent on devouring a person's soul, as if it could burn even the world's all things.

A strange light flashed in Xue Yue's eyes—she was stunned.

She concentrated, feeling the mysteries contained within that demonic flame and probing its attribute, and couldn't help but exclaim: “How can there be such a contradictory power?”

That demonic flame alternated between cold and heat, with Yang and evil coexisting. These contradictions combined perfectly, mutually enhancing and bolstering each other's might, evolving into a singular, unparalleled power attribute.

Xue Yue had never seen such an odd power before.

She could hardly imagine, if such a power invaded a martial artist's body, how that person could resolve it or resist it!

She couldn't think of a good way!

Within her beautiful eyes a flicker of horror and thrilled excitement rose!

She was terrified by the flame's peculiar strangeness and yet exhilarated by the enormous hidden potential in Yang Kai.

This man was currently only a martial artist at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; this unique power of his probably couldn't exert much effect yet. But if he could be trained up to the Saint King Realm or even the Origin Returning Realm, the impact this demonic flame could have would be unimaginable.

His power attribute gave him a natural advantage that others could hardly match!

Once he grows, it will be hard to find opponents at the same level—unless they had cultivated equally peculiar powers.

“Does anyone in your Guild possess the same kind of power as me?” Yang Kai asked.

“No.” Xue Yue shook her head honestly, abandoning the idea of finding him a master. Yet her eyes shone with a different light as she coquettishly asked, “Yang Kai, how about we discuss something?”

“Discuss what?”

“Once the day comes that we undo the soul chain, I won't harm you; everything that happened before will be wiped clean. I'll provide you with the best cultivation environment and the finest resources to help you increase your strength and grow as fast as possible.”

“That good?” Yang Kai's face didn't move as he chuckled: “Tell me, what are your conditions?”

“How about you follow me?”

“I won't……” Yang Kai shook his head. “I told you, I will not be controlled by you!”

“Being controlled and following are two different things.” Xue Yue protested, feeling wronged. “You can't interpret it like that.”

“To me it's the same thing.”

“At most… at most I can give you the chance to court me!” Xue Yue's cheeks flushed red as she lightly bit her lip, seemingly making a great concession!

Yang Kai's special power made her truly want to win and subdue him.

Hearing her say that, Yang Kai couldn't help bursting into loud laughter.

“What are you laughing at?” Xue Yue's blush hadn't faded; she was a little angrily embarrassed.

“You’re known to the outside world as Young Master Xue Yue… If I don’t court you, I doubt there’s anyone left in this world who would. Do you really want to end up that lonely?”

“You… you bastard!” Xue Yue burst out cursing.
