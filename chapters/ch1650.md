## Chapter 1650 — To Ask For One Person

Inside the Jade-Ice Palace, Luo Hai sat upright on his chair, a golden crown binding his hair, his bearing peerless; a glint of excitement flickered and vanished in his eyes.

Finally found you! Luo Hai felt a furtive thrill in his heart, though he showed not a trace of it on his face.

He, a top expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, could rank among the most notable figures in this Star Domain, yet he was utterly at a loss against a mere Yang Kai — not only had Yang Kai broken through the blockade he set on Cuiwei Star, he had even shaken off his pursuit.

Had it not been for Luo Hai's patience, the fellow might truly have slipped through his hands and escaped.

Now let us see where you can run! Luo Hai's heart surged with elation.

At his level, there were few things that could stir him, yet the Void Mind Crystal the Yao King left in the Blood Prison tempted Luo Hai, and the Imperial Treasure on Yang Kai's person made him drool with desire.

The former could grant him an opportunity to break into the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; the latter could cause his power to leap dramatically!

Should both treasures fall into his hands, Luo Hai was confident he would become the preeminent figure in the entire Star Domain, and when he spoke, the domain would obey — none could stand against him!

The crux of everything lay with Yang Kai.

Though Luo Hai hid his expression well, Chi Huo and Luo Li were both Void King Realm experts and naturally noticed that fleeting change on his face.

Chi Huo's expression shifted; he wondered whether that brat Yang Kai truly possessed some earth-shattering secret — otherwise why would Luo Hai be so taken with him?

More than a year ago, Luo Hai suddenly descended upon Chi Lan Star, greatly surprising Chi Huo. Shortly after, he ordered the Fire Radiance Sect to search for Yang Kai’s whereabouts, which immediately drew Chi Huo’s attention. Many times he tried to probe indirectly, hoping to learn why Luo Hai was seeking Yang Kai, but Luo Hai never revealed his reasons, leaving Chi Huo utterly helpless.

Luo Li was thoughtful too, but the deep worry written between her brows kept her from dwelling on it.

This time Luo Hai and Chi Huo had clearly come with ill intent!

Soon Yang Kai strode into the Ice Palace.

Inside the palace, besides the three Void King Realm experts, many of Ice Heart Valley's elders stood behind Luo Li — their numbers were considerable, a dozen or so in all.

Behind Luo Hai and Chi Huo stood a youth whose face was waxen and whose qi and blood floated weakly.

He was Wei Feng, the Sect Master's son of the Fire Radiance Sect!

At this moment he excitedly peered outward as if awaiting someone's arrival. When he saw Su Yan, his eyes brightened; he displayed an expression of extreme eagerness, like a mangy dog that had spotted a sumptuous morsel, saliva almost dripping from his mouth.

But when he saw Su Yan holding Yang Kai's hand in a tender, intimate manner, his face went cold; his sinister gaze fixed on Yang Kai, hatred and fury flashing in his eyes.

Where did this bastard pop out from! To actually dare hold his woman’s hand—utterly courting death! Wei Feng was nearly furious enough to explode.

In an instant Wei Feng regarded Yang Kai as good as dead, plotting all the tortures he would inflict to make Yang Kai wish for death yet be denied it, to show him that some women were not to be touched.

"Junior Bing Long pays respects to Lord Luo Hai and Senior Chi Huo," Bing Long bowed gracefully, then turned to Luo Li and said, "Grand Elder, the person has been brought here."

Luo Li lightly nodded without a word, her beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai, her brows knitted.

Feeling her gaze, Yang Kai glanced back.

It was his first time meeting Ice Heart Valley's Grand Elder; judging by her strength, she and the other red-haired elder in the ice chamber were not far apart, both at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, far inferior to Luo Hai's majestic presence.

But a Void King Realm cultivator was still a Void King Realm cultivator — mastering Domain power that the Origin Returning Realm could not match. At least Yang Kai felt immense pressure emanating from her!

"Brother Luo Hai, is this the brat you were looking for?" the old rogue Chi Huo sized Yang Kai up and chuckled.

Luo Hai nodded: "Yes, it's him!"

"Sure enough, a promising appearance — Luo Hai, your eye for talent is sharp; now that you've found him, what do you intend to do next?" Chi Huo asked casually.

"What to do... hm, naturally take him back to Cuiwei Star." Luo Hai wore a genial smile as he chided Yang Kai, "You little bastard, I won’t eat you — why do you avoid me as if I were a venomous snake or scorpion? I merely find your aptitude remarkable and see some fate between us—so I wish to pass on my legacy to you!"

His tone was casual, with an air of helpless reproach, as if he truly meant it.

Many elders of Ice Heart Valley brightened with envy and turned to look at Yang Kai, their faces full of admiration.

To be noticed by a power like Luo Hai was a Heaven-defying stroke of fortune; thereafter the youngster would surely become famed across the Star Domain, soaring to prominence.

Yang Kai only smiled lightly.

Chi Huo squinted his murky old eyes; a sharp light flickered within.

Luo Li merely furrowed her brows and remained silent.

In the entire Ice Palace, perhaps only Yang Kai and the other two Void King Realm experts would not take Luo Hai's words at face value.

Everyone knew this was merely a pretext for Luo Hai to take Yang Kai away — the talk of taking him as a disciple and passing on his legacy was pure fantasy!

What sort of person was Luo Hai? He would not trouble himself to go to such lengths for a mere disciple. If he wished to recruit pupils, a single announcement would draw countless prodigies to Cuiwei Star, lining up to join him.

Yang Kai did not expose the truth; he only said, "I appreciate your kindness, Senior, but such a monumental fate I fear I am unworthy of. Please seek another worthy disciple."

A concealed fury flashed in Luo Hai's eyes — he thought the brat ungrateful — yet he still smiled warmly: "Don't be in such a hurry to refuse; come back to Cuiwei Star with me first and stay by my side for a few years. If you still hold this attitude then, I will not force you."

He appeared to be making a great concession.

Chi Huo chimed in beside him: "Youngster, think carefully — Luo Hai offering to take you as a disciple is a blessing you could not earn in a hundred lifetimes; ordinary people beg for such a chance, so why refuse?"

“Senior thinks that’s a blessing? Well then, since you feel that way, why not take Luo Hai as your master instead?” Yang Kai said with a faint smile, looking at him.

The elders of Ice Heart Valley froze, staring at Yang Kai as if he were a monster; every heart leapt to their throats.

This guy… truly audacious beyond measure! To actually dare insult Chi Huo like that—was he not afraid of provoking consequences he couldn’t possibly bear?

Chi Huo's face chilled; he roared, "How dare you!"

As he spoke, a streak of keen light burst from his pupils, striking toward Yang Kai like a tangible thing.

He intended to punish this impudent brat.

Yang Kai's face did not change; he stood unmoving, and Su Yan treated the terrifying assault as nothing — her beautiful eyes never left Yang Kai's face, gazing at him sideways with a countenance full of happiness.

Luo Hai waved his hand, his motion casual.

Chi Huo's attack was silently dispelled.

Before uncovering the secrets Yang Kai was hiding, Luo Hai wouldn’t feel at ease letting Chi Huo injure him.

"Brother Chi Huo, calm yourself — the youngster merely spoke rashly; there's no need to take it to heart. Brother Chi Huo is also of the Void King Realm; even if I wished to instruct him, I might find myself unable to."

Chi Huo snorted and cast a cold glance at Yang Kai; that cutting stare seemed to want to tear him to pieces, and he had nothing more to say.

Luo Li, who had sat silently all this while, suddenly said, "The person has been brought — Lord Luo Hai, if you wish to take him away, then be my guest."

What Luo Hai planned to do after taking Yang Kai away was Luo Li's concern no longer.

She had no ties with Yang Kai and would not offend Luo Hai on his account. Right now she only wished to see Luo Hai and Chi Huo leave Icebound Island as soon as possible.

She had no mind to pursue Yang Kai for injuring Ran Yunting and causing commotion on Icebound Island.

A sense of unease nagged at her, a nameless palpitating dread as if some great calamity would befall should she fail to get Yang Kai away quickly.

Luo Hai bowed at her words and smiled to Luo Li: "I apologize for coming uninvited and any disturbance caused; I hope Junior Sister Luo Li will forgive me. If in future you have leisure, please visit Cuiwei Star — I will receive you with courtesy."

Luo Li said faintly, “There will naturally come a day for me to pay a visit. Since Lord Luo Hai has found such an excellent disciple, I imagine he must be eager to return to Cuiwei Star to instruct him carefully. I won’t see you off, then.”

She plainly issued an order to see them off.

To her surprise, Luo Hai merely smiled and did not rise to leave; instead he glanced at Yang Kai and waved, "No hurry — my business here is done, but Brother Chi Huo has matters for this visit as well; I'll wait for him."

At these words Luo Li's expression shifted slightly.

Could the thing she feared be coming to pass?

Luo Hai had not been explicit, but the mere phrase 'wait for him' sent a bad scent into Luo Li's nose.

It implied Luo Hai stood with Chi Huo this time.

Bing Long, Ran Yunting and the others' faces turned grim as they warily looked toward Chi Huo.

Ice Heart Valley and the Fire Radiance Sect vied for dominance on Chi Lan Star; for thousands to tens of thousands of years neither had gained the upper hand and their strengths were comparable. If Luo Hai intervened now, Ice Heart Valley would absolutely fall to the losing side.

An absolute disadvantage; even relying on Icebound Island's Icebound Great Array might not reverse the outcome.

For a moment Bing Long and many elders were furious but dared not speak.

Yang Kai stood in the Ice Palace with a faint smile, watching the show, showing not the slightest awareness that he was already a prisoner under guard.

"Chi Huo, what urgent matter brings you to Icebound Island this time?" Luo Li drew a breath to steady the storm within and asked cautiously.

Chi Huo laughed heartily, his fire-red hair flying, his bearing full of force; shaking his head, he said, "A trivial matter, Luo Li — you need not be so tense."

He was very pleased; after their many years of rivalry with Luo Li, even during her recuperation from injury he had never been able to seize the advantage, but now he savored the feeling of victory. Though there was a hint of bluff, Chi Huo greatly enjoyed the sensation.

"Speak then," Luo Li said coldly.

Chi Huo chuckled, "I came only to ask your sect for one person."
