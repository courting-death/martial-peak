## Chapter 1424 — Dragon Bone Sword — Dripping Jade

Time flashed by; more than ten days passed, and after the first thrill and novelty, the people from Dragon Lair Mountain had gradually grown accustomed to life within the ruins of the Taixuan Sect, now inside the Lingxiao Sect.

Here Spiritual Qi was abundant, the mountains and waters were clear and beautiful, and the air was crisp and natural — truly one of the world's finest Sacred Lands; compared to when Yang Kai first stepped into the Star Domain and entered the Floating Continent, the difference was only a hair's breadth.

The only shortcoming was that the entire Flowing Flame Sandland remained wrapped by two rings of the Three Flames Ring, effectively cut off from the world; not only was it hard to transmit news outward, but when one looked up there were no sun, moon, or stars to be seen — the firmament was a flowing crimson light screen.

Of course, everything had its pros and cons. The current Lingxiao Pavilion might appear isolated from the world, yet that very isolation spared them from countless troubles. Otherwise, for a mere few dozen people to occupy such a vast and prime location without drawing the covetous eyes of others would indeed have been strange.

Everything was in perfect order.

The Ten-Thousand-Year Incense Yang Kai had brought back from the Sixth Stage of the Flowing Flame Sandland was placed by Yang Yan in a secret chamber in the front hall, guarded by layer upon layer of formations; if any disciple wished to breakthrough and advance, they could apply to Wu Yi and the others, and after approval go to the secret chamber to rely on the miraculous Ten-Thousand-Year Incense for secluded cultivation.

Also placed there was the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree.

These two extraordinary treasures could both help one comprehend the mysteries of the Martial Dao and also calm the mind and dispel inner demons; both were precious aids for cultivation breakthroughs.

Whether the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense or the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, both had originally been kept in Yang Kai's Stone Residence on Dragon Lair Mountain. But more than a month ago, when powerful enemies besieged Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Yan took the opportunity to transfer them. She used the mountain's restraints and formations to slip away while the enemies' attention was fixed on Yang Kai, her purpose solely to relocate these treasures.

Even that Red Candle Base and a small segment of Red Candle Fruit flesh were now safely kept in a medicinal garden in the front hall; though they would not grow further, their medicinal properties remained perfectly preserved.

Even the parent plant of the Blood Sword Grass had been brought here by Yang Yan, and the enormous Fire Crystal Stone had not been left behind either; these things made excellent array cores for setting formations — Yang Yan was not one to forget such treasures.

One could say that although Dragon Lair Mountain had been razed to the ground, the Lingxiao Sect suffered no loss at all; if anything, they rode that battle to establish a formidable reputation.

At least a dozen forces and over one hundred Origin Returning Realm cultivators had joined the assault, yet in the end they suffered heavy casualties and fled in disgrace. Even the top sects on the Dark Star could not achieve such a feat; only Star Emperor Mountain might have been capable.

After that battle nobody dared to ignore Dragon Lair Mountain, and the name of its lord, Yang Kai, spread far and wide. That one of only the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm could accomplish such exploits easily became the talk of markets and taverns, praised by many.

The Lingxiao Sect was quietly established; without Yang Kai's knowledge, Wu Yi and the others declared him Sect Master.

Yang Yan became the Vice Sect Master. Ye Xijun served as Great Elder, while Chang Qi, Hao An, Ning Xiangchen, and Ge Qi held elder positions.

A small sect of only a few dozen people had taken shape — small as a sparrow but with every organ complete — and this was simply because they did not wish to throw the doors wide open to recruit disciples; with the Lingxiao Sect's excellent location and current momentum, a single announcement would likely cause the gates to be thronged, countless unsupported martial artists coming to seek refuge.

Their foundations were unstable; now was not the time to do that — everyone understood this.

The Divine Tree was released by Yang Kai once more. In the battle over a month ago the Divine Tree's performance had left Yang Kai stunned and greatly surprised; he would not be stingy with it, immediately forcing out two drops of Golden Blood for the Divine Tree to absorb and refine.

The Stone Puppet's performance had likewise been noteworthy, and it received a very generous reward — a large amount of rare metal ore. The Stone Puppet could absorb the essence of metallic minerals to strengthen itself; this was its innate talent.

The Lingxiao Sect's front hall gradually calmed; everyone went about their duties, and Yang Kai remained in seclusion.

Only Yang Yan, together with Wu Yi and the others, kept busy without pause; after all, this would become their sect's main headquarters, and Yang Yan naturally had to reestablish the restrictions and formations. Fortunately, most of the Taixuan Sect's old formations and restrictions were still usable — merely depleted of energy and not activated — so she only needed to repair or refill them with Saint Crystals.

That was no great task for her; in fact she enjoyed it.

Ye Xijun guarded at her side all day long, never leaving, maintaining the posture of a subordinate.

Yang Kai had previously noticed that when this woman looked at Yang Yan, there was a fervent, worshipful light in her eyes; it seemed any order from Yang Yan she would carry out without hesitation.

In Tianyi Palace, the hall Yang Kai now occupied, he sat cross-legged in a side chamber, hands extended, palms holding a secret treasure that was jade-green through and through, sword-like in shape.

It appeared like a long sword but actually had no blade, rather blunt; at the hilt a bead the size of a dragon's eye was set, and within the green sword-body something like a serpent happily writhed.

This secret treasure was naturally the product of fusing the Dragon Bone and the Dragon Pearl. The Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl's original form was a poisonous dragon with aggressive instincts; as a member of the Ancient Divine Spirit race its strength reached the heavens and the earth and was utterly unfathomable.

Therefore even a roughly refined secret treasure formed from a fragment of Dragon Bone and a Dragon Pearl was of unimaginable potency.

In the Dragon Lair Mountain battle Yang Kai had fully experienced its lethal power, but that thread of dragon soul was proud beyond measure and refused to be subjugated, nearly causing a catastrophe; in the end Yang Kai had to forcibly suppress it with the Blooming Lotus secret technique.

That forced measure had been only temporary, a stopgap rather than a lasting solution.

Yang Kai now took it out with the clear intention of resolving the matter once and for all; otherwise each use would require forced suppression, preventing the weapon from displaying its full power and risking backlash.

This was no laughing matter — artifacts backfiring on their wielders was common enough. Forcing mighty treasures beyond one's level could lead to such consequences, which is why every warrior chose a secret treasure suited to their ability rather than assuming stronger was always better.

Moreover, the Dragon Bone Sword in his hands was barely an initial form, not fully refined — only at a level fit for use.

After all, materials from an Ancient Divine Spirit's body were not so easily refined.

What pleased Yang Kai greatly was that this Dragon Bone Sword seemed capable of growth and evolution. In the Dragon Lair Mountain battle the sword had transformed into a colossal green dragon and, after devouring the flesh-essences of several Origin Returning Realm warriors, its aura had noticeably strengthened.

Having discovered that, Yang Kai no longer allowed it to swallow at will; he now found it difficult to fully suppress, so deliberately making it stronger would be like lifting a stone only to drop it on his own foot.

Only once the potential danger was thoroughly eliminated could he let it grow without restraint.

“Your whole body gleams with vivid emerald light—then I’ll call you Dripping Jade,” Yang Kai muttered to himself, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.

He gripped the hilt; vast Saint Yuan poured in like a tide, a high dragon's roar resounded through Tianyi Palace, and the next moment the side chamber was lashed by gale and dazzling green radiance.

Violent pressure swept out, and a colossal green dragon suddenly appeared before Yang Kai.

It was the manifested form of the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade, seemingly corporeal; the immense dragon-body coiled in place, its head held high, two eyes the size of copper gongs gazing imperiously at Yang Kai with unmistakable disdain.

Though only a remnant soul remained and little intelligence was left, the pride etched within the bones of an Ancient Divine Spirit could not be erased.

Yang Kai's present strength, compared to the Saint Spirit race, was as insignificant as an ant.

Dragon might rampaged; Yang Kai's bones cracked as if they were snapping, and he felt crushed beneath a mountain ten thousand zhang high, an indescribable sense of powerlessness welling up.

Yet he did not withdraw nor show the slightest fear; instead he met the dragon's gaze with cold indifference.

The World-Ending Demon Eye manifested in his left eye, the narrow golden pupil emitting boundless demonic force, and around that golden pupil a mysterious radiance shimmered.

It was the Glazed Light.

When combined with the World-Ending Demon Eye the two complemented each other; their power did not simply add, it multiplied.

This time Yang Kai did not employ the Blooming Lotus secret technique — after all, relying entirely on secret arts to placate the dragon soul's pride was unacceptable; he had to make it comprehend its position, to know who would be master and who would be servant, so that in future he could command it without fear of being turned upon.

The large eyes and the small eyes regarded each other: one scoffing, one imperial; neither bowed or yielded.

Even though the Dragon Bone Dragon Pearl had been refined within Yang Kai's body for years and was tinged with his aura, completely subduing it was not so simple.

An invisible contest unfolded between Yang Kai and the green dragon; wave after wave of unseen spiritual strikes rippled outward. Thankfully Tianyi Palace's restraints were strong, or this chamber might have been obliterated in an instant.

Although Yang Kai's cultivation level was the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, the strength of his Divine Sense already rivaled that of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and with the World-Ending Demon Eye's aid an unprepared Third Stage Origin Returning Realm opponent would still suffer greatly — yet even so, dealing with the dragon soul remained a prodigious strain.

No matter how Yang Kai drove his Divine Sense to press upon it, the dragon remained unmoved, showing no trace of terror, submission, or yielding.

Time passed slowly; Yang Kai's face gradually paled as he continued to unleash Divine Sense without pause or reserve — even with his foundation, he felt the strain.

Blood had already seeped from the World-Ending Demon Eye; the entire left eye had gone crimson. That narrow golden pupil kept emitting intangible tugging and attracting forces in an attempt to unsettle the dragon soul, but it was like waves striking a reef — spray flew, yet the reef did not even tremble.
