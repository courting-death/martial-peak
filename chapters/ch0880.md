## Chapter 880 — Fanning the Flames

Wu Jie chuckled into a feral grin; he didn't move, yet an enormous pressure descended upon the two, draining the color from their faces as they suddenly realized the gulf in strength between them and Wu Jie—any thought of resistance evaporated, terror flooding their eyes.

One of them stammered, "Who are you, and why have you captured us?"

Wu Jie remained silent. His eyes, like hellfire, flickered unsettledly as he scrutinized them, which only deepened their panic and sent shivers through their bodies.

After a long while, Wu Jie said coldly, "I have questions for you. You may answer or remain silent, but if you fail to satisfy me, I'll strip your souls out and probe your memories. If you don't want to suffer soul-devouring torment, you'd better cooperate."

"Soul-devouring torment…" The two Transcendent Realm warriors trembled, their faces blanching in fear.

Their own cultivation wasn't weak, so they understood what soul-devouring torment meant—a torture the soul could scarcely endure. Only the most vicious of warriors would use such methods to extract information.

This man exuded a verdant aura and had eyes like ghost-fire; it was plain to see he wasn't to be trifled with.

They nodded frantically. "Ask—whatever we know, we'll tell you."

Wu Jie gave a faint smile of satisfaction, then asked at leisure, "Do you know what this place is?"

The two exchanged a glance and both nodded. One replied, "It should be the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, right?"

"Correct, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. You're bold—knowing it's the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and still wandering outside it?" Wu Jie raised an eyebrow. "Tell me, what are you doing here?"

The man on the left hurriedly answered, "We're here searching for secret treasures."

"Searching for secret treasures?" Wu Jie smiled oddly. "Out here?"

"Yes."

"Who told you there are treasures out here?"

"Many people spread the rumor…" The man hastily explained. Yang Kai realized then—someone had been spreading word that during a great battle a few years ago countless warriors had died in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and dropped many secret treasures nearby, which drew people to try their luck and see if they could find something valuable.

"There are quite a few people outside, all searching for secret treasures?" Wu Jie asked, frowning.

"Some of them, yes, and some seem to be hunting demonic beasts…" the man said. "I heard many Sixth- and Seventh-Tier demonic beasts that escaped from the Beast Sea Great Forest have passed through here—those beasts carry decent refining materials on their bodies."

The other man hurried to add, "And some are here to purge the demons. I heard the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's new Saint Lord took in a group of demons; they're trying to clear them out to set the right example!"

"You lot?" Wu Jie looked at them as if they were fools, sneering, "Since you heard there are demons here, haven't you heard what level those demons are?"

"The rumor says not many of them are experts—just a few Transcendent Realm warriors…"

"Heh…" Wu Jie gave a strange laugh and nodded. "Not many experts… hm, indeed not many. Only five."

But those five were Saint Realm prodigies, and three of them had reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm!

Wu Jie had personally seen Li Rong and Xueli fight; he knew that with the backing of the Ancient Demon Clan, this was not the sort of matter one or two large sects could swallow.

To wipe them out would require at least three or four powers on the level of Tianxiao Sect banding together—and even then they had to be prepared to suffer massive losses.

For these clowns to think they could purge the demons was pure suicide.

After questioning them further and confirming their information was scant, Wu Jie knocked them out again.

Standing, he frowned at Yang Kai. "Saint Lord, it seems someone deliberately spread harmful rumors to herd these eager warriors to the edge of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land."

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded. For some reason he immediately thought of the human expert Wu Zheng he had met before.

If someone wasn't steering them, it made no sense so many would be deceived; whoever spread the rumor must have some authority, otherwise the easy lies would be exposed.

Wu Zheng clearly had that capacity.

"What would the rumor-monger gain? They know these people can't do anything to a Sacred Land," Xu Hui asked, puzzled.

"Someone doesn't want Li Rong and the others to stay in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land," Yang Kai snorted. "Nor do they want us to be close to the demon clans—they think it's a humiliation to humanity."

Wu Jie's eyes rolled as if he had an idea, and he raised his brow. "Saint Lord, you mean that person incited these eager warriors to come here to lure you into taking action?"

"That's likely." Yang Kai nodded. "If you strike, whoever pulled the strings can pin it on Li Rong and the others. Then they'll have an excuse to rally the martial world to attack Li Rong and others. If they are assaulted, I cannot stand idly by—if I intervene, the Sacred Land gets dragged in, and it would then stand against the rest of the world; the Sacred Land wouldn't be able to survive."

"So devious?" Xu Hui's expression changed.

"Yes, rather despicable and vicious…" Wu Jie pondered. "If any power found so many outsiders loitering near their doorstep, they'd move to drive them off. I suspect among those people are planted provocateurs waiting for you to act so they can blow the matter up."

Yang Kai glanced at him and gave a short chuckle—Wu Jie's words hit the mark.

"Saint Lord, how shall we handle this?" Xu Hui asked. The situation wasn't yet dire, but if they waited longer more warriors might be duped to gather outside the Sacred Land.

This trend had to be extinguished quickly.

Yet the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had only just begun to stabilize its development; provoking too many powers now would have future consequences.

Especially since Yang Kai had not yet fully matured.

"What does the Great Elder think?" Yang Kai asked, looking to him for counsel.

Xu Hui replied respectfully, "I think we should tell the truth to those deceived warriors and let them leave on their own. The scattered secret-treasure story is false—if such things existed, the Sacred Land itself would have claimed them. Those who fail to find anything will gradually disperse, and the yao have already retreated to the Beast Sea Great Forest. If they truly dare to hunt demonic beasts, they can go to the Yao Realm. As for those who came to purge the demons, we can deny Lady Li and her kin's existence—nobody can enter the Nine Peaks to investigate, and the people of Li's clan are obedient and wouldn't go out. After this storm passes, there should be no more trouble."

Yang Kai saw that Xu Hui did not want to make a big fuss.

After some thought, he nodded. "Then follow the Great Elder's plan. You lead men to disperse the warriors loitering outside the Sacred Land. But don't be too lenient—if you're overly soft they'll think the Sacred Land is weak. Make sure they understand the consequences of disobedience! After all, if someone trespasses into our domain, we can strike and kill without asking reasons!"

"As the Saint Lord says!" Xu Hui agreed repeatedly.

In the past, those loiterers would have been driven off without words; he wouldn't have bothered speaking. If they resisted, they'd have been killed outright. But the Sacred Land is not what it once was, and he now acted with caution, no longer fearless as before.

"Fine, give them three days to withdraw a hundred li from the Sacred Land. Anyone still lingering when the deadline passes is surely a provocateur—deal with them by killing them!" Yang Kai ordered.

"Yes, I'll handle it at once!" Xu Hui said, and took his leave, escorting away the two captives Wu Jie had brought.

Li Rong's eyes glittered, and she stared at Yang Kai with a smile playing at her lips.

She suddenly realized that after years apart, Yang Kai had grown more and more into the manner of a leader.

When he was captured and taken to Mogu Castle years ago, he had been a cautious young man; now he could read the situation and make appropriate decisions.

Li Rong hoped dearly to see this—she secretly believed that under his command the Ancient Demon Clan would have a future worth pursuing.

"Saint Lord, I shall take my leave then. There are many matters within my sect to attend to. If you have the time, you're always welcome at the Netherworld Sect!" Wu Jie bowed and prepared to depart.

"Sect Master Wu, don't hurry off." Yang Kai stood.

"Saint Lord, is there more?" Wu Jie asked suspiciously.

"I'd like to see Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall—Sect Master Wu, guide me there."

"Gladly!" Wu Jie smiled faintly.

"Li Rong, come with me." Yang Kai called over his shoulder.

"Mm." Li Rong nodded and stepped forward.

Stepping out of the hall, the three became a streak of light and, like a bolt, left the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

There had once been four powers nearby, but now only the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and the Netherworld Sect remained.

The four forces had been relatively close—only a couple of hundred li apart.

That distance was nothing for Yang Kai now; it would take little time to reach, especially with Li Rong using her True Yuan to carry them swiftly.

In just a moment they arrived above a cluster of buildings in the mountains below.

"This is the War Soul Hall. Of the three nearby forces, it's closest to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and often benefited from the Nine Peaks. A pity Cao Guan was short-sighted and ruined such a foundation," Wu Jie said, pointing down.

Yang Kai nodded, peering down. The buildings were scattered like chess pieces; many had collapsed, and here and there dark red stains of blood remained.

It appeared Wu Jie had recently brought the War Soul Hall's disciples under control and stirred up some trouble.
