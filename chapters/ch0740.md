## Chapter 740 — Secrets

Above the Ice Sect's domain, Qian Hao's expression flickered with complexity; Yang Kai frowned tightly, staring at him without blinking.

"Kid, where did you find this thing?" Suddenly Qian Hao looked up and asked Yang Kai.

"About half a day's travel from here, inside an iceberg," Yang Kai answered casually. "What's the matter?"

Qian Hao did not reply; his face only grew sterner. Suddenly he threw back his head and let out a long howl, the cry carrying a heavy warning.

Yang Kai's eyes flashed. He realized he must have tripped over something sensitive, or inadvertently tugged at one of the Ice Sect's most delicate nerves.

What sort of remains were sealed in that ice block? Whose skeletal remains were those, that Qian Hao greeted them as if facing a mortal enemy? While issuing the warning, his Divine Sense remained locked onto the ice without the slightest relaxation.

At the sound of his howl, the Ice Sect was aflutter; experts of Transcendent Realm and above mobilized. Led by Ice Lord Qing Ya, they all arrived at this stretch of sky together.

"What has happened?" Qing Ya asked urgently as soon as she arrived.

If it were not important, Qian Hao would not have been so tense. She immediately sensed the gravity of the situation.

"Follow me!" Qian Hao ordered, and shot downward, his True Yuan quietly coalescing, ready to erupt at any moment.

Yang Kai's face was strange; bewildered, he followed after the Ice Sect crowd.

On the ground, everyone from the Ice Sect had gathered around the ice block that sealed the jet-black skeleton. Many frowned and examined it with suspicion; like Yang Kai, they could not make sense of it. Yet when Qing Ya and the other Saint Realm elders saw the skeleton, their faces all turned ashen.

"All of you, step back!" Qing Ya hurriedly ordered.

The Transcendent Realm experts looked at one another but asked no more questions; they obeyed Qing Ya and retreated.

Soon only Qing Ya and four elders remained beside the ice block, along with Yang Kai — six in total.

"Where did you get this?" Qing Ya asked in a grave voice, her pretty face solemn.

"This brat found it," Qian Hao said, pointing at Yang Kai.

"Yang Kai, where did you find this? How did you discover him?" Qing Ya pressed, questioning him closely.

Seeing her serious demeanor, Yang Kai knew something was amiss. He hurriedly recounted everything that had happened. The listeners grew progressively more solemn as they heard him out.

"What? He wasn't one of your Ice Sect disciples?" Yang Kai frowned. He had meant well and had not expected to bring trouble upon the Ice Sect; he felt embarrassed.

"A vicious fiend like that would never be our disciple!" Qian Hao snorted coldly, a violent hatred rising on his face.

"A vicious fiend?" Yang Kai was astonished. "Uh, I didn't know he had enmity with your Ice Sect. I only thought he might be one of your missing or dead disciples. Fine, I'll take him back then."

"Don't!" Qing Ya stopped Yang Kai at once, shaking her head slowly.

Yang Kai gave a wry laugh. "You're making a mountain out of a molehill. Whoever he was in life, he's already dead now; why be so on guard?"

"Who said he's dead?" Qian Hao snorted.

Yang Kai's smile vanished; he frowned. "What do you mean?"

"He's not dead. He's still alive!" Qian Yue murmured in a low voice, her pretty face paling.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded. He glanced at the others and found, to his shock, that none of them contradicted Qian Yue — they all agreed with her.

"Not dead? But this person has no flesh, only bones and meridians left, how—"

Qing Ya inhaled lightly and cut Yang Kai off, speaking softly, "There are many strange lifeforms in this world you have never heard of. No one knows how they are born, but these odd lifeforms often possess power surpassing a flesh-and-blood body."

Yang Kai immediately thought of the True Spirit found inside jade.

The True Spirit in jade is also a kind of lifeform; it has no flesh but, if it matures, can possess world-destroying might.

Qing Ya's words were hard for him to fully grasp, but he quickly accepted them.

"But you needn't be too alarmed; this one doesn't seem very strong," Qing Ya said with a faint smile. Hearing this, Qian Hao and the others finally relaxed.

"Yang Kai, since you brought it back, you must help deal with it," Qing Ya said, turning her gaze to him.

"Yes, Sect Lord, speak your orders!"

"Burn it," Qing Ya said, pointing at the ice block before them.

Yang Kai fell silent, circulating his True Yuan. A sweltering, searing energy immediately enveloped the ice block.

The ice visibly melted at once, and soon the skeleton sealed within was exposed.

Just as Yang Kai prepared to add more force to burn it to ashes, a vicious, violent aura suddenly emanated from the skeleton.

Yang Kai froze, then his face changed; greenish flickers appeared in the skeleton's eye sockets, like living eyes, shining with a deadly light. At the same time, the skeleton moved in a strange, eerie way.

It seemed to be struggling.

Qing Ya's pretty face went cold. She acted swiftly, releasing several bursts of energy to pin the skeleton to the ground.

Yang Kai's True Yuan surged even more wildly.

A howl echoed in their ears as a cruel, savage spirit prowled around them, invading each mind in an attempt to unsettle their composure.

The Ice Sect's Saint Realm experts were unmoved; Yang Kai's expression likewise remained unchanged.

Qing Ya, who had been watching him, found herself seeing him in a new light. She had expected Yang Kai to be affected somewhat but was surprised that he remained indifferent.

The wailing at their ears grew ever more tragic and frantic, saturated with a fierce clamoring.

Gradually the cries weakened and then ceased altogether.

Huh...

The jet-black skeleton was finally ignited and turned to powder in an instant, vanishing completely from the world.

Watching the strange scene, Yang Kai felt as if it were not quite real.

He had never imagined a being could exist without flesh yet still be conscious.

"Sect Lord, can you explain what exactly that was?" Yang Kai asked, frowning at Qing Ya. He was baffled and uncomfortable.

"Why ask so many questions?" Qian Hao snorted.

Qing Ya waved her hand and spoke softly, "How shall I put it? I don't know much myself; it's what our predecessors in the Ice Sect told us. It should be a race called the Bone Race."

"The Bone Race?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Yes. They have no flesh, only bones and meridians, yet their strong are capable of heaven-shattering skill. Our Ice Sect's decline is inextricably linked to this race."

"No one can say precisely where that race came from. Besides the Bone Race, there are other strange lifeforms that mysteriously appeared on the Tongxuan Continent long ago. You remember I told you before, those calamities that caused the fall of several great powers? They're closely related. Part of the reason we live here now is because of them. Our elders said some of the Bone Race escaped here; we've been stationed to guard and search. Over the countless years we've hunted and exterminated many frozen Bone Race members. Since I took over the Ice Sect, this is the first time we've found one; it seems there are still stragglers."

"That's really interesting," Yang Kai said, his expression peculiarly odd.

"This is no laughing matter. What you found this time was a very weak Bone Race individual. If a powerful one had slipped through, our Ice Sect would have been in dire straits!" Qian Hao said coldly.

"Then why do you remain here?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

"Although the Bone Race has powerful members, not every one of them is so fearsome. Besides... we are not weak ourselves. We guard this place to prevent them from wreaking havoc," Qing Ya said with a faint smile.

Yang Kai's expression shifted. "So you silently serve the entire continent?"

"Ha, we merely follow the wishes of our ancestors. Besides, the outside world is too noisy; we prefer not to leave," Qing Ya said, pursing her lips in a smile.

Yang Kai felt a surge of respect.

"Elders, please take people and carefully sweep the surroundings to see if any Bone Race remnants remain," Qing Ya instructed the four elders.

"Yes!" the four answered in unison and directed the Transcendent Realm experts to split into four groups and depart in different directions.

Yang Kai stood where he was, thinking for a long while before asking anxiously, "Su Yan is here — will she be safe?"

"Don't worry," Qing Ya said, gazing at a point in the void. "With me here, nothing will happen to her. Even if there are Bone Race members, they won't be able to stir up trouble here."

Hearing that, Yang Kai was relieved. He reached into the Black Book Space and took out the ice pearl, handing it to Qing Ya. "I found this in that iceberg. Su Yan said it might greatly help those who cultivate ice techniques."

"Cold-Ice Jade Crystal?" Qing Ya's brows arched in surprise, then she exclaimed, "No — Cold-Ice Jade Marrow?"

"What do you mean?"

"The outer layer is Cold-Ice Jade Crystal, but the liquid inside is the purer Cold-Ice Jade Marrow. You're truly lucky to have found even this," Qing Ya said in astonishment. "With this, Su Yan's strength will advance even faster; it's a treasure for those who cultivate ice methods."

Saying this, she smiled at Yang Kai. "You give this to me — are you not afraid I'll pocket it? It would be useful to me as well!"

Yang Kai laughed lightly, carefree. "Pocket it if you will. Su Yan receives much care here from the Sect Lord; consider it a token of thanks from this junior."

"Always talking cheap!" Qing Ya teased him with a glance, then spoke seriously, "Rest assured. When Su Yan wakes, I will give this to her. I have no interest in coveting a junior's possession."

"In any case, Su Yan will be in your care, Sect Lord," Yang Kai said solemnly, clasping his fists.

Qing Ya seemed to sense something and asked, "You won't go see her one last time?"

"No need. As long as she is safe, that is enough.” Yang Kai shook his head. “This junior will take his leave.”

Saying that, he turned and departed.

"If you meet Meng Wuya, tell him for me: the favor he owes me will be repaid sooner or later!" Qing Ya's voice called from behind.

Yang Kai waved vigorously in farewell as he left.
