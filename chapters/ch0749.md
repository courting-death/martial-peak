## Chapter 749 — Mysterious Barrier

Although with Yang Kai's current strength he held little regard for the others who had come to this ancient ruin — with a Soul Devouring Worm in hand, anyone below the Saint Realm was no match for him — he had kept himself concealed until now because he needed this group's help to scout the ancient site and gather information; thus he followed at their rear and acted alongside them.

Now that he had a decent understanding of the situation, Yang Kai planned to break off from the group and act on his own.

He was very curious about the source emitting that Yang-attributed energy and wanted to investigate what lay in that direction.

And now presented the opportunity.

Yang Kai believed that, given Hai Wangu's temperament, he wouldn't care if Yang Kai lived or died.

Unexpectedly, hearing this Hai Wangu slowly shook his head: “That won't do. I can't just leave you alone here.”

It seemed Yang Kai's behavior earlier had made Hai Wangu somewhat concerned; a look of genuine care crossed his face as he instructed a Hai Family warrior, “Fourth Brother, stay and look after him. Once his injuries stabilize, catch up with us.”

The man who received the order immediately nodded and stood beside Yang Kai in a protective stance.

Yang Kai was half-amused, half-annoyed, and could only reply, “Thanks for your kindness, senior.”

Hai Wangu inclined his head slightly. “Mm — heal quickly, then catch up with Fourth Brother. We’ll rest up ahead and wait for you.”

With that he led the others onward.

Yang Kai could only feign cultivation while the so-called Fourth Brother remained silent, standing not far off like a wooden post.

After about half an hour, Yang Kai finally rose to his feet again.

“How are you?” Fourth Brother asked anxiously.

“Should be fine now.”

“Then let us hurry and catch up.” Fourth Brother said with urgency.

They sprinted forward, following Hai Wangu's trail, and within the time it takes for a stick of incense to burn, the two had rejoined the main party.

But when Yang Kai took in the scene within the group, his expression turned severe.

What had once been a twenty-man party was now short by six or seven; moreover, the faces of those who remained were all marked by lingering dread.

While Yang Kai had been pretending to heal, they had clearly encountered some deadly peril, and the fate of those six or seven missing men could be guessed at without much thought.

This ancient ruin truly was no safe place!

A crowd was resting here; when Yang Kai and Fourth Brother returned, Hai Wangu merely nodded and wore a displeased expression, offering no further comment.

“What happened just now?” Fourth Brother went up to a Hai Family warrior and asked in a low voice.

The man, still shaken, answered softly: “There seem to be many inexplicable sealing formations here. Someone accidentally triggered one and a few people died.”

Fourth Brother's face darkened and he dared not press the matter further.

At that moment a sharp howl cut through the distance.

Hai Wangu, who had been sitting in place, opened his eyes and looked toward the sound, muttering, “People from the Cheng Family?”

He rose quickly and waved: “Please follow me; something's happening over there.”

About five li from Hai Wangu's resting spot a large crowd had gathered; these were warriors who had rushed over after hearing the howl.

Led by Transcendent Realm experts of the Seven Families Alliance, waves of reinforcements arrived.

On arriving and seeing the scene ahead, every face was struck with astonishment and excitement.

Ahead of them hovered a huge transparent sphere, emitting earth-shattering energy fluctuations — whatever material formed it, from the energy it radiated it was clearly a high-grade Secret Treasure.

And it was completely intact!

But at that moment an invisible barrier stood before them, blocking everyone's way; any warrior who tried to approach the glowing sphere could only stop short, gazing at it with covetous eyes.

One by one, warriors tried to get closer but were repelled by a gentle force, unable to come within fifty zhang of the sphere.

When Hai Wangu led Yang Kai and the others here, the place was lively — at least dozens had already gathered.

Yang Kai's heart stirred as he eyed the sphere and began to pay it close attention.

A familiar aura drifted through the crowd, and following it Yang Kai couldn't help but roll his eyes.

Over there, the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land smiled at him with pursed lips, wearing an odd expression.

Yang Kai turned his gaze away and pretended not to notice.

This woman seemed capable enough; she remained immaculate despite the journey, composed and serene, and her beautiful eyes shone with excitement as if she were thoroughly enjoying this undersea adventure.

Foolish girl, Yang Kai thought to himself.

“Brother Cheng, what's going on?” Hai Wangu stepped forward and asked an elderly man who stood at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

The howl had come from that elder. The Seven Families Alliance had long been rooted on nearby isles and maintained special signals, so when Hai Wangu heard the call he knew the man was summoning aid.

Many Transcendent Realm cultivators gathered around the Cheng elder with the same question, their voices grave.

“Wait until everyone is here and I will explain,” the Cheng elder said.

The crowd fell silent and waited.

As time passed more and more teams arrived, all evidently treasure-seekers from nearby areas.

The numbers swelled and soon well over a hundred had gathered.

After waiting a while and seeing no more arrivals, the Cheng elder spoke: “Very well, it seems no one else is coming.”

“Brother Cheng, can you tell us why you called us here?”

“Of course — for that Secret Treasure!” the Cheng elder smiled and pointed to the luminous sphere. “This treasure’s power is unfathomable; we don't know its purpose, but when we found it it was guarded by an invisible barrier, as you all just saw. One squad from the Cheng Family alone cannot break it, so I ask for everyone’s united effort to overcome this obstacle.”

Hai Wangu frowned and chuckled, “Brother Cheng, cooperating is fine, but this treasure is only one item — if we break the barrier, who ultimately claims it?”

“Everything is negotiable!” the Cheng elder evaded the question and pointed behind the sphere: “Behind it stands a palace. If I'm correct, that place must be important to this ancient sect; otherwise they wouldn’t have used such a treasure to guard it. If we breach the barrier and enter, surely more and better Secret Treasures await inside.”

“That, after all, is only your conjecture!” Hai Wangu said, frowning.

“But it's worth a try!” someone agreed.

The assembled experts quickly debated and soon reached a consensus.

Though Hai Wangu harbored doubts, he could not deny the sphere's allure.

With agreement secured, everyone set about arrangements.

Each Transcendent Realm cultivator had brought along a team, numbering from ten to twenty men apiece.

Hai Wangu returned to Yang Kai and the others and relayed the decision.

“All of you, contribute your strength. If we can break this barrier we will obtain that mysterious Secret Treasure and can search the hall behind it for more gains — please give your utmost.”

“Rest assured, Old Hai. We'll spare no effort!” someone cried out eagerly.

Hai Wangu nodded in satisfaction.

Moments later, everything was in place.

More than a hundred stood a short distance from the invisible barrier, holding their breath and bracing themselves.

The Cheng elder stepped forward and announced: “When I give the order, act only on my command. This barrier’s defense is peculiar — it must be struck with maximum force in a single instant; otherwise it will hold regardless of how you attack.”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

The Cheng elder swept his gaze over the crowd, raised a hand solemnly, and each person gathered their True Yuan, ready to strike.

Then, the Cheng elder’s great hand crashed downward.

At that instant a riot of martial techniques and Secret Treasure powers exploded outward, all converging toward the barrier.

The ground trembled with thunderous booms.

The ruins themselves seemed to shudder.

Though relatively few were Transcendent Realm cultivators — less than ten — the crowd still contained a large number of Seventh Stage Divine Roaming and above, and the combined force in that instant was earth-shattering.

Countless energies slammed into the invisible barrier, sending visible ripples across the air like hundreds of stones tossed into a calm lake.

The barrier flexed inward under the strikes but did not break.

When the dust settled, faces around the barrier were grim.

That initial assault had failed to breach the defense.

The Cheng elder clapped to draw attention and called out: “Again — do not hold back! Breaking this barrier benefits everyone; none of us wants to waste time here.”

He could see many had not expended full strength before, underestimating the barrier’s resilience.

Hearing him, those who had held back steeled themselves and prepared to unleash everything.

After a brief pause the Cheng elder raised his hand once more, his eyes stern as he scanned the crowd; those he fixed upon gathered every last ounce of True Yuan.
