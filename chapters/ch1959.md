## Chapter 1959 — Sudden Assault

When two paths met on a narrow road, naturally the brave prevailed.

Yang Kai's raging Divine Sense had swept through like a storm, forcing the other's Divine Sense back and violently striking the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness, tearing a rift in that mental bulwark; the man couldn't help but stagger backward several steps and cry out in pain.

In that look, there was none of the lofty bearing of the once-superior Senior Brother—he appeared wholly like a weakling who could not bear a setback.

Yang Kai's body shuddered as well, his face paling.

But he bit his teeth and made no sound; instead he shifted his footing and charged across at incredible speed.

"Senior Brother Zhou Yi!" Chu Fei cried out in alarm.

From his vantage, that Senior Brother called Zhou Yi had only exchanged a glance with Yang Kai, and both men's faces had instantly gone pale and their bodies trembled; Zhou Yi had taken a few steps back while Yang Kai seized the chance to press forward, a cruel, terrifying grin twisting his face.

He himself was a Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator and could sense the ripples of the Divine Sense collision between the two, yet he could not believe that in that clash the Senior Brother Zhou Yi had suffered such a crushing loss.

Seeing Yang Kai advance instead of retreating, Chu Fei hurriedly shouted a warning.

But it was already too late.

No sooner had he finished speaking than Yang Kai had reached the man called Zhou Yi; five-colored radiance flared over his fist as the Undying Five Elements Sword qi howled and wrapped around it, and with a downward, hammer-like blow he smashed his fist into the man's cheek.

Boom……

The air trembled violently as the savage force burst forth; Zhou Yi was driven by that brutal impact into the ground, leaving a human-shaped depression in the solid earth as dust flew everywhere.

At the sight of that, Chu Fei seemed to see his own humiliation from three months before; his face turned ashen and his body trembled, while the other two brothers were even worse—screaming, they scrambled backward in a hurry, terrified of being dragged into the mess.

"How could this be?" Chu Fei was utterly dumbstruck.

He had thought calling Senior Brother Zhou Yi to avenge him would result in Yang Kai being soundly taught a lesson; with Protector Bian's faction nearly devoid of experts, naturally no one would come to stop them.

Today was meant for settling scores and humiliating Yang Kai—who could have imagined the Senior Brother he invited would be floored by Yang Kai at a single glance.

The bizarre spectacle before him nearly blinded Chu Fei with astonishment.

Only then did Chu Fei notice: Yang Kai's cultivation was no longer Second Stage of the Void King Realm; he had already reached the Third Stage.

"He actually managed to breakthrough at that damned Ice Cliff?" Chu Fei's heart jolted in panic as he realized just how severe this trouble was.

In the Biyu Sect there was a customary rule: any disciple banished to the Ice Cliff for confinement who did not die would be taken seriously; if one not only survived but gained insight or even broke through while at the Ice Cliff, they very likely leapt to become an Elite Disciple of the Sect, their status soaring overnight.

Over the years many Senior Brothers had risen to prominence because of that.

After all, the Ice Cliff was formed by a strike of an Emperor-Stage expert; it was saturated with Imperial Might and the chilling Power of the Laws—breaking through in such a place already testified to a cultivator's exceptional talent.

And now Yang Kai was undoubtedly such a disciple.

If this news spread, it would surely draw the Sect's attention, and the Junior Brother Chu Fei resented would rise in standing; then he would no longer be someone Chu Fei could look up to, let alone take revenge upon—he could only pray that Yang Kai wouldn't come after him.

A host of anxious thoughts raced through Chu Fei's mind; he quickly realized that if he could not resolve this perfectly today, disaster might befall him, and he became panicked and distraught.

As he cursed Zhou Yi for being useless in his head, an enraged low growl suddenly rang out: "You brat, you're asking for death!"

The voice was filled with an indescribable hatred, like a wounded beast snarling low; the arising icy killing intent made one's hair stand on end.

Chu Fei's eyes brightened and he cried out with joy, "Senior Brother Zhou Yi!"

The low roar had come from Zhou Yi, who had been floored by Yang Kai's punch.

Although Yang Kai had shown no mercy, Zhou Yi was still a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert—how could he be so easily finished? His misfortune lay in his Divine Sense being damaged, leaving him unprepared for Yang Kai's sudden assault.

Now that he had come to his senses, he was naturally furious.

As he spoke, he turned his head viciously, his eyes flushing red as waves of murderous intent burst forth.

If before he had come only at Chu Fei's request to vent some anger, after taking Yang Kai's punch he had already moved to kill.

To be humiliated by a Junior Brother a Stage below his own—how could he wash away that stain on his life without blood and death?

The atmosphere suddenly stiffened; a Dao Origin Realm expert's rage even affected the Laws, and winds gathered toward Zhou Yi, whipping his black hair as if he were a mad demon and adding to his imposing aura.

Yang Kai's skin tightened as an instinctive sense of crisis rose; without hesitation he activated the World-Ending Demon Eye.

His left pupil changed into a golden vertical slit, narrow and terrifying; within the golden eye a strange power faintly emanated, a force potent enough to bind and restrain souls.

Under that four-eyed standoff, Zhou Yi could not help but flinch, sensing a demonic power inside the narrow pupil that affected his soul and will.

He had already suffered some damage from the Divine Sense collision with Yang Kai, and now the World-Ending Demon Eye's influence opened an obvious flaw.

Yang Kai seized the opportunity and unleashed his most powerful soul technique, roaring, "Bloom, Lotus!"

A budding lotus pattern suddenly appeared in his left eye and, with a faint tremor, shot into Zhou Yi's pupils.

Everything before Zhou Yi suddenly changed; he saw only a lotus, which frenziedly siphoned his Divine Sense as nourishment and slowly unfurled its petals, preparing to display its beauty.

Yang Kai now held the advantage in soul power and would not relinquish it; with the Blooming Lotus Secret Art he once again seized the initiative.

Before Zhou Yi could react, Yang Kai flicked his hands and dozens of Golden Blood Threads erupted forth; under Divine Sense control they twisted and intertwined, forming a golden net that enveloped Zhou Yi.

This was merely one manifestation of the Golden Blood Threads' transformative path.

"Dragon Transformation!" Yang Kai used the secret art without hesitation; his right arm became a ferocious dragon-claw, its talons razor-sharp as it plunged toward Zhou Yi's chest.

By now it had reached the point of life and death — Zhou Yi's murderous intent was far more than mere intimidation; it was a genuine determination to kill his enemy.

Yang Kai naturally would show no mercy to someone intent on his death.

"Brother Yang, don't!" Liu Qianyun cried out from behind.

If Yang Kai truly killed Zhou Yi, the matter would be irretrievable, and she did not know how to defuse the situation; she could only call out on instinct.

Yang Kai ignored her, his expression cold and fixed on the satisfaction of slaying his enemy.

Just as the dragon-claw was about to pierce Zhou Yi's chest and tear open his heart, Zhou Yi suddenly shook free of the Blooming Lotus technique's influence and yelled, "You brat, you have some guts!"

With a crash the lotus pattern in front of Zhou Yi's eyes shattered; his suppressed killing intent burst forth, and simultaneously the presence of a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator surged.

"Sorrow Wind Palm!" Zhou Yi growled, thrusting a palm to his chest; within the palm wind-attributed energy swirled and condensed like the vortex of a storm, drawing Yang Kai's right arm into its midst.

Crackling noises of friction rang out.

Yang Kai's right arm, where the dragon scales of power had formed, shattered and even the dragon-claw struggled to hold its shape.

Though a Dao Origin Realm First Stage cultivator was only a single Stage above Yang Kai, because his power had fully transformed into Origin Qi his true combat power was beyond what a typical Third Stage of the Void King Realm could match.

Moreover, a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm had already touched the threshold of the Laws and could roughly invoke the Power of the Laws to augment his killing moves.

Zhou Yi had undoubtedly refined wind-attributed power, and the Sorrow Wind Palm contained his understanding and use of wind forces.

The law of wind was ethereal and agile; when attached to the Sorrow Wind Palm it made the technique all the more unrestrained and otherworldly.

The terrifying killing intent coming his way changed Yang Kai's face, but he did not retreat; instead he gritted his teeth and drove the dragon-claw deeper into Zhou Yi's chest.

"You…" Zhou Yi's eyes trembled violently; though he threw Origin Qi out to form a guard, he still could not stop Yang Kai's piercing dragon-claw.

Under that terrifying claw, his defenses were as fragile as paper and utterly useless.

Yang Kai clutched Zhou Yi's heart in his hand!

At that moment the Sorrow Wind Palm's strike also hit Yang Kai.

Yet his form suddenly twisted and he vanished in place, letting the raging force strike the void.

When the aftershock dissipated, Yang Kai's figure reappeared as if he had never moved.

Nothingness!

The new secret art turned Yang Kai's body into Nothingness, merging with the void to avoid most of the Sorrow Wind Palm's lethal force.

But the residual force still slammed into Yang Kai, raging through his flesh and blood and ravaging his physical body.

His chest churned with Qi and blood and he nearly coughed up a mouthful of blood.

"Not dead?" Zhou Yi cried in horror.

He had thought Yang Kai intended to die with him—after all Yang Kai's hand was inside his chest holding his heart, and with a little more force Zhou Yi would be finished; the enraged Sorrow Wind Palm he had struck with was not something a Third Stage of the Void King Realm could simply withstand if it had hit squarely.

What baffled Zhou Yi most was that Yang Kai seemed to have only suffered minor injury and was hardly harmed.

What kind of Secret Art allowed him to remain in place yet avoid an attack as if he did not exist in that space? To be continued.
