## Chapter 1149 — Disturbance Before the Tower

Yang Kai turned his head, curious as to who would dare be so arrogant in front of Qu Changfeng.

At a glance he was slightly surprised; the newcomer's clothing was hardly worth mentioning — plainly shabby to the extreme — yet the faint aura emanating from him seemed even fiercer than Qu Changfeng's, sharp and cutting, and Yang Kai vaguely felt a fluctuation of lightning energy pulse from the man.

This man cultivated lightning attributes and had achieved great proficiency. He wasn't tall, but he was unquestionably an expert, for his cultivation was the same as Qu Changfeng's — Third Stage of the Saint King Realm!

Two Origin Returning Realm experts trailed behind him as well, clad in azure robes with a lightning emblem on their chests; the lightning seemed to have been cleaved from the Ninth Heavens, its might boundless and soul-stirring.

"So it's you — no wonder, it's Brother Fang of Leitai Sect, long time no see. Still so meager, aren't you afraid of shaming Leitai Sect?" Qu Changfeng greeted with a smile that didn't reach his eyes.

Yang Kai's heart stirred and he immediately understood who the plainly dressed man was.

Fang Tianzhong of Leitai Sect! Like Qu Changfeng, he was a renowned rising star of Dark Star and the foremost genius of Leitai Sect.

Geniuses have always considered themselves superior and dislike being treated as equals; both these fellows were their sects' prodigies and already held some friction between them, so when they met they naturally exchanged barbs and concealed jabs.

The two guards at Jubao Tower stood helplessly by; if any ordinary person had acted so brazenly in front of the tower they would have taught them a lesson, but with Qu Changfeng and Fang Tianzhong's identities on display they dared not interfere.

Yang Kai and the other two standing aside were reduced to mere scenery.

“I cultivate the Martial Dao and comprehend the Heavenly Dao—unlike Brother Qu, who struts around every day, flaunting his splendor for all to see,” Fang Tianzhong said coolly.

Qu Changfeng gave a cold snort, his aura bursting forth with a roar as it pressed toward Fang Tianzhong. Naturally, Fang Tianzhong was not to be outdone and unleashed his own aura in response.

It was like two gales rising from the plain and colliding; the Spiritual Qi in front of Jubao Tower swelled and fell, and many experts inside the tower sent out Divine Sense to look over. Once they learned the clash was between Qu Changfeng and Fang Tianzhong, they retracted their Divine Sense and minded their own business.

The two geniuses fought as if no one else existed; Yang Kai's face cooled. He'd held a certain favor toward Fang Tianzhong — this fellow seemed straightforward and unpretentious, far better than Qu Changfeng — but that slight goodwill immediately evaporated.

If an ordinary First Stage Saint King Realm cultivator were standing here, they would surely be swept up by the clash of the two men’s momentum — even if they weren’t injured, they’d end up in complete disarray.

The two of them clearly paid no heed to him, Wu Yi, or Yang Yan — they only wanted to give the other a warning shot.

As the shockwave of their momentum swept over, Yang Kai gave a cold snort and casually waved his hand forward.

It sounded as though something had been split apart. Yang Kai stood firm as a mountain, not a strand of his hair or a fold of his clothes stirred. Behind him, Yang Yan and Wu Yi didn’t feel a thing.

"Eh?" Qu Changfeng and Fang Tianzhong simultaneously reined in their aura and turned to look at Yang Kai, both showing surprise.

Although their momentum hadn’t been directed at Yang Kai just now, it was still not something a First-Stage Saint King Realm cultivator could casually withstand. Seeing him so effortlessly disperse the residual force of their aura, the two of them were naturally astonished.

Yet it was only astonishment; they still did not truly regard Yang Kai's cultivation.

“The two Senior Brothers’ relationship must be truly wonderful — meeting and already so inseparable, how enviable.” A crisp, melodious voice like the chime of silver bells rang out. A woman in elegant robes approached gracefully, her skin like polished jade, her hands slender and soft, carrying a natural air of delicate fragility, as though a mere breeze could topple her. She evoked in anyone who looked upon her a protective urge. Her figure was exquisite, and the light purple gown she wore outlined her curves perfectly, further accentuating her noble grace.

As she drew near, a faint fragrance drifted over, refreshing the heart and quickening the blood.

Though her words were teasing, neither Fang Tianzhong nor Qu Changfeng showed the slightest anger. On the contrary, the latter even appeared pleased, his gaze burning as he looked at her.

“Sudie greets the two Senior Brothers,” the woman said with a graceful bow. Her fair face held a rosy glow, soft enough to bruise at a touch, her beautiful eyes brimming with charm that could steal a man’s soul.

"So it's Junior Sister Yin, long time no see — Brother misses you terribly," Qu Changfeng laughed, no longer bothering to spar with Fang Tianzhong.

Fang Tianzhong gave the woman a slight nod in greeting.

As geniuses of Dark Star, they naturally knew each other.

“I didn’t expect Junior Sister Yin to also attend this auction. Looks like coming here was the right choice after all. How about joining me later? We could have a good chat — your Senior Brother has been studying Shi recently and has gained some modest insights.” Qu Changfeng invited warmly, his tone brimming with self-satisfaction.

Yang Kai snorted inwardly, unimpressed; he knew the difficulty of comprehending Shi. Even after absorbing the soul energy of two Origin Returning Realm experts he couldn't begin to enter Shi, and Qu Changfeng, despite his higher realm, couldn't possibly grasp Shi before reaching Origin Returning Realm — Qu Changfeng's talk was clearly just an excuse to get close to Yin Sudie.

Yin Sudie understood even better than Yang Kai what was going on. She smiled faintly, her charm overflowing as she said softly, “Although this Junior Sister would also like to chat more with Senior Brother Qu, I came this time under my master’s orders and have a task to complete. I’ll have to thank Senior Brother Qu for his kind intentions.”

"That's fine, there's time enough," Qu Changfeng laughed it off with composure, not embarrassed by her refusal; he'd surely been rebuffed by her before — it would be stranger if she agreed.

The three of them had been standing at the entrance for some time while people from various sects came to attend the auction, yet they did not enter; those young lords and ladies could only wait on the side.

Compared to those people, Yang Kai realized how shabby he, Wu Yi, and Yang Yan looked: the young lords and ladies wore bright garments and rode proud steeds, brocades and gauze, armor and jewels, their spiritual resonance flowing.

Yang Kai wore only a common, plain robe; Yang Yan was worse — an unchanging black long robe as if hiding her face in shame; Wu Yi's attire was decent but still ordinary, nothing to rival others' treasure armor.

The three of them were like ugly ducklings who had wandered into a flock of swans, drawing all attention.

Fortunately they had no intention of lingering; the auction was about to begin and they wanted to get in. After the young lords and ladies greeted Fang Tianzhong and his party, the crowd filed in and disappeared.

Before leaving, Fang Tianzhong glanced at Yang Kai with seeming casualness, but said nothing.

Once the area before Jubao Tower quieted again, Wu Yi breathed out and quietly explained to Yang Kai, "That woman just now is Yin Sudie of Liuli Sect — a leading figure and the most beautiful woman on Dark Star; countless people pursue her."

"The most beautiful?" Yang Kai scoffed. "You two aren't any worse than her — that title is a bit overrated."

"How could I compare?" Wu Yi blushed; whether or not Yang Kai's words were sincere, the praise pleased her. No woman is indifferent to her looks, and she knew she fell far short of Yin Sudie, whose background was many times nobler.

"Let's go in," Yang Kai said lightly. He had come to the auction to protect Wu Yi and Yang Yan, but hadn't expected to run into so many rising talents.

Whether Qu Changfeng, Fang Tianzhong, or Yin Sudie, none were figures to be taken lightly. Yang Kai knew he still had a long way to go and was far from invincible.

Their appearance reminded Yang Kai that one must never underestimate rivals of the same rank; they were the best of their sects and who could say how much hidden foundation they possessed — a real fight would be unpredictable.

Wu Yi finally produced the invitation and handed it to the guard at the entrance, who seemed surprised that three like them had secured one; though startled, he didn't make trouble and let them pass.

Inside Jubao Tower a clamorous hubbub greeted them: countless clusters of people conversing in small groups.

"So this is Jubao Tower?" Wu Yi's pretty face was filled with awe as she looked around, her eyes full of curiosity — it was her first time in such a place.

Before them lay a huge circular hall; lamps crafted from illumination stones hung from the dome, casting soft light that illuminated the interior without casting a single shadow.

On the grand hall’s lowest level, rows of seats were neatly arranged, with nearly eighty percent already occupied. On the upper floors as well, figures moved about in the crowd, the place bustling with people.

At the center of the lowest hall rose a platform three feet above the ground — the place for auctioning items.

The arc-shaped design allowed every attendee to clearly see the items up for bid — a clever arrangement.

Yang Kai looked around to find Qian Tong, but quickly realized it would be difficult; in a place like this finding someone was arduous. Had he been a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm he could have used Divine Sense without care, but among so many experts he dared not casually employ Divine Sense lest others misinterpret and cause trouble.
