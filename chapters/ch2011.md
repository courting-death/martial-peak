## Chapter 2011 — Mu Xiao

A gurgling, gulping sound filled the air. Thin streaks of dark red spread across the vines like fresh blood, and the cultivator entangled in them went utterly still in an instant.

Worse, his body withered away—reduced to little more than skin and bone as if all his flesh had been drained.

"Devouring Essence-Blood!" Yang Kai's face changed dramatically.

He could see exactly what had happened: the vines had pierced the man and sucked out his flesh‑and‑blood essence in the span of a breath or two. He was dead—beyond dead.

The man had been a Void King Realm cultivator; yet before those vines he was as helpless as a toddler.

"A Mu Xiao — a Mu Xiao. The thing sealed underground is a Mu Xiao."

At that moment Mo Xiaoqi suddenly cried out, obvious terror in her voice. It was the first time Yang Kai had seen her so panicked — even back on Yuqing Mountain when she had encountered the Luan Feng hatchling she had remained calm — but upon learning the truth her expression changed at once.

"Eldest Brother Yang, hurry and go — we can't fight it; it absorbs others' flesh‑and‑blood essence to restore itself quickly." With that Mo Xiaoqi thrust out her hand and tossed something; a flawless white jade war‑chariot materialized before them.

She grabbed Yang Kai and the two leapt into the chariot together.

Mo Xiaoqi immediately formed spirit‑seals with her hands and poured power into the chariot. With a buzzing hum, more than ten layers of sealing light sprang up around it in an instant, making it appear impregnable.

Then Mo Xiaoqi hissed, "Go!"

The war‑chariot trembled and tried to carry them away.

But at that moment countless vines, as if gone mad, burst from fissures in the ground — some coiling into whips, others forming clusters of barbs — and they attacked the chariot frenziedly.

For a time the chariot's sealing light flashed wildly, but its grade appeared high and the seals held; the vine attack that could instantly kill a Void King Realm could not penetrate the chariot's defenses — at least not right away.

Still, under so many blows the chariot began to sway and could not break free.

After that brief delay the chariot was tightly wrapped by vines.

Mo Xiaoqi's face drained of color.

"Moon Blade!" Yang Kai snorted. His hands met and opened, and a gigantic Moon Blade shot forth, cutting through several vines that had coiled the chariot.

Although it had an effect, Yang Kai remained grim. He had underestimated the vines' resilience; the enormous Moon Blade severed only four strands before its power faded.

Those cut vines regenerated another segment in the blink of an eye and continued to envelope the chariot.

"Eldest Brother Yang, use fire‑type power — other elements can't truly destroy these vines," Mo Xiaoqi shouted. She patted a cloth bag at her waist and a fierce, crimson beast like a qilin leapt out, radiating the peak aura of the tenth tier; it opened its maw and spat a ferocious flame.

Where the flame passed, the vines writhed as if grievously wounded.

Seeing this, Yang Kai devised a plan: he channeled the fire sword‑qi of the Undying Five Elements Sword, forming in his hand a longsword of living flame, and hacked repeatedly, sending the vines crashing down.

The severed vines did not regrow immediately; fire‑type power truly seemed to suppress them.

Mo Xiaoqi did not stand idle either: after releasing the qilin‑like beast she produced a crimson handkerchief, infused it with Origin Qi, and it instantly transformed into a cloud of fire that burned in all directions.

With the combined efforts of the two and the beast, they finally cleared the vines around the chariot for the moment.

Before the vines could wrap them again, Mo Xiaoqi stamped her jade foot and the chariot shot forward like an arrow.

Countless vines brandished fangs and claws in pursuit, but they fell farther and farther behind.

After ten breaths the chariot escaped the danger zone; the vines stopped their chase.

Mo Xiaoqi drew deep breaths, her face reflecting the relief of surviving a calamity.

Looking back, within a radius of ten li, countless vines writhed like tentacles in a grisly sight.

"Xiaoqi, what is a Mu Xiao?" Yang Kai finally asked.

"It is the product of a divine tree's spirit awakening, possessing its own intelligence and extremely troublesome; depending on the spirit‑tree's kind, Mu Xiao possess different innate heavenly techniques. We do not know what abilities this one has, but basically all Mu Xiao are extremely hard to kill, because pure wood attribute represents life force and regeneration — even if heavily injured it can recover after a while. Mu Xiao come in good and bad varieties; this one should be an extremely dangerous thing. We don't know how long it was sealed, but its strength must have declined considerably — otherwise with our current power we could never have escaped this calamity."

"A Mu Xiao is that terrifying?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

"Of course. Eldest Brother Yang, you must not underestimate it; there was once an Emperor Realm expert who perished at a Mu Xiao's hands. Now that it has been released it will try to restore itself immediately, and from earlier signs the quickest way to recover is by devouring the flesh‑and‑blood essence of cultivators like us… Damn, the second layer is no longer safe," Mo Xiaoqi said, her expression changing.

"Surely not — the second layer is vast; can't we just hide somewhere?"

"What if it finds us?" Mo Xiaoqi looked at Yang Kai with concern.

"Then what? Return to the first layer?" Yang Kai frowned.

"The Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda only goes up, not down; we cannot return to the first layer..." Mo Xiaoqi's brows knitted, then she brightened suddenly: "Why not... try the third layer?"

Yang Kai was startled: "How do we get there? Didn't they say the Pagoda only opened the first and second layers this time?"

"Try anyway; if we truly can't ascend then there's nothing to be done — maybe we'll get lucky." Mo Xiaoqi chuckled, withdrew the qilin‑like beast into her bag, released the Flying Heaven‑and‑Earth Bat again, and ordered it to search for an entrance to the third layer.

... 

Three days later they stood before a pillar of five‑colored light that reached from earth to sky.

This Five‑Colored Pillar of Light was identical to the one Yang Kai had seen before; it was clearly the entrance to the third layer. Yet when Yang Kai stepped into it, nothing happened — unlike before he was not immediately transported onward.

He looked helplessly at Mo Xiaoqi, who smiled mysteriously and drew from her Spatial Ring a Secret Treasure shaped like a long shuttle.

At the appearance of that Secret Treasure Yang Kai's expression shifted.

From it he sensed an extraordinary aura — this was definitely not a Void King‑Grade Secret Treasure, nor something a Dao Origin‑Grade Secret Treasure could possess.

Imperial Treasure!

That long‑shuttle‑shaped Secret Treasure was unquestionably an Imperial Treasure.

Imperial Treasures carry the Power of the Laws themselves; the few Imperial Treasures he owned were such, which is why they could unleash tremendous might. The one in Mo Xiaoqi's hand was clearly an Imperial Treasure.

Yang Kai was shocked inwardly but it made sense upon reflection, so he did not ask rashly.

"This Nine‑Star Seal‑Breaking Shuttle is a Secret Treasure Aunt Feng once gave me, specialized in breaking various seals. Although with my ability I cannot unleash its full power, with Eldest Brother Yang's help perhaps we can break the seal here and enter the third layer," Mo Xiaoqi explained.

"What do you need me to do?" Yang Kai asked.

"It's like this." Mo Xiaoqi briefly explained and taught him a set of hand movements.

Yang Kai memorized them carefully, practiced a few times, and then nodded to Mo Xiaoqi.

Mo Xiaoqi understood; she tossed the Nine‑Star Seal‑Breaking Shuttle, and as she formed spirit‑seals the Secret Treasure calmly expanded, growing to a length of two zhang.

She entered the shuttle first and beckoned Yang Kai.

Once both had entered, Mo Xiaoqi sealed the shuttle, exchanged a glance with Yang Kai, and began to flick her hands, forming spirit‑seals.

As time passed their powers poured into the shuttle, and its surface began to flicker with specks of starlight.

Slowly, a star pattern on the shuttle's surface lit up.

After a moment, another star pattern glowed.

A while later, a third star pattern shone.

By then both Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi had reached their limits; their energies rose and fell and their expressions were strained.

After all, it was an Imperial Treasure; even the combined power of the two could not unleash half its might.

Mo Xiaoqi's expression turned solemn; her spirit‑seals shifted, and she cried, "Break!"

In the next instant the Nine‑Star Seal‑Breaking Shuttle quivered and suddenly shot into the Five‑Colored Pillar of Light, then vanished.

Those inside the shuttle felt weightless at once; both rejoiced inwardly but did not slacken, continuing to sustain the shuttle's power.

After a while the discomfort faded.

They exchanged a glance; Mo Xiaoqi, full of expectation, opened the shuttle and leapt out first, then cheered, "Eldest Brother Yang, it seems we have truly arrived at the third layer."

Yang Kai was greatly pleased; stepping out, he found the place looked similar to the second layer but with differences — the residual Power of the Laws flowing around seemed far denser.

Mo Xiaoqi giggled proudly, "Not so difficult after all."

"Recovery comes first; the third layer should be far more dangerous than the second," Yang Kai cautioned, and extended his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings.

After confirming no immediate danger he sat cross‑legged, took from his Spatial Ring a bottle of Spiritual Pills, swallowed one, and recovered the power he had expended.

Mo Xiaoqi did the same, but before doing so she released her Silver‑Maned Lion‑Tiger Beast, the Flying Heaven‑and‑Earth Bat and the qilin‑like demonic beast to keep watch around, showing extreme caution.
