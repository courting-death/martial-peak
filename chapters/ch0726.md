## Chapter 726 — You Weren't Dead?

Three years ago was precisely the time when he and Shui Ling parted ways in Duao City.

Upon learning that Yang Kai was the young lord the little princess had mentioned, He Pu abruptly dropped his previously casual manner and at once became warm and enthusiastic.

He was a gregarious man, silver-tongued, he praised Yang Kai endlessly—youthful, handsome, and possessed of formidable strength.

Yang Kai let him talk for a while before cutting him off abruptly: “I want to see your little princess. Can you take me to where she is now?”

He Pu’s expression turned somewhat awkward at once. “Under ordinary circumstances, with the little princess’s summons you would present this token and I would personally escort you there. But now… it seems the little princess is not on her own island. How about this: I’ll have my men make inquiries and find out exactly where she is, and then I’ll take you there—how does that sound?”

“Fine.” Yang Kai nodded. He had already found the Water Divine Hall, and once he saw Shui Ling he could learn what message Meng Wuya had delivered to her and how Su Yan and Di Mo were doing; there was no need to rush. “Then I’ll trouble you.”

“No trouble at all, brother—please have a seat, I’ll be right back.” He Pu said respectfully, withdrew, ordered wine and fruit brought, and entertained Yang Kai with earnest hospitality before hastily leading a party away from Yinyun Dao.

Yinyun Dao served as the Water Divine Hall’s outermost natural barrier and a hub for material transport; people came and went constantly, making it a bustling place.

Yang Kai waited here for a full half day before He Pu returned in a rush, laughing loudly: “Brother, I have not failed you—I found the little princess. She seems eager to see you; she told me to bring you to her at once. Shall we set off now?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai rose and followed He Pu out.

Normally those of the Water Divine Hall traveling to and from Yinyun Dao had to take boats, because once they left the surface the thunderous power accumulated in the island’s clouds would strike down upon them. But just today those bolts of lightning had only moments ago been absorbed by Yang Kai, so He Pu dared to escort Yang Kai through the air.

Midway, He Pu began outlining the foundations of the Water Divine Hall for Yang Kai.

In this region for a thousand li in every direction there were thousands upon thousands of islands, all properties of the Water Divine Hall; the islands brimmed with Spiritual Qi, produced abundant Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines, and offered excellent cultivation conditions.

Because the islands were distributed so widely, finding someone among them was usually rather troublesome.

As the little princess of the Water Divine Hall, Shui Ling naturally had an island of her own—one of the finest among the Hall’s isles—but today she was not on her own island; she had gone to a place called Yunfeng Dao.

The Water Divine Hall’s holdings lay upon the sea, far from worldly turmoil and the clamor of cities; the environment was elegant—yet there was one thing that vexed the Hall’s people.

That thing was the sea beasts that roamed the ocean and would occasionally come ashore to act wantonly.

These sea-dwelling Demonic Beasts differed greatly from those on land; they were generally massive, versed in the mysteries of the water element, and troublesome to deal with. If low-tier beasts struck it was manageable, but when a powerful Demonic Beast appeared even the Water Divine Hall’s cultivators had to expend great effort to drive it off or slay it.

At this very moment on Yunfeng Dao, Shui Ling was directing a group of cultivators in battle against a sea beast the size of several houses.

The reefs around Yunfeng Dao had been smashed to pieces, the waves churned wildly, and the scene was exceedingly perilous.

The sea beast had eight long fleshy limbs that writhed and lashed about with uncanny agility; from its fearsome maw it fired countless surging water arrows whose lethality could not be underestimated.

Although Shui Ling’s forces included many experts, the beast’s vitality was astonishingly tenacious; without a certain-kill blow it could not be driven away.

When He Pu’s arrival was reported earlier, Shui Ling could hardly believe it; her mind was in chaos, her commands fell into disorder, and the cultivators under her were scattered in their movements—nearly causing fatalities.

“Liu Zhuo, you take command!” Shui Ling’s heart was in turmoil, and she no longer paid much heed to the Demonic Beast; her pretty eyes overflowed with joyful anticipation as she planted her feet and craned her neck toward the distant sky, as if waiting for something.

The man named Liu Zhuo nodded heavily at her words, took up the mantle of command, and began issuing orders methodically; the chaotic scene soon steadied.

Casting a furtive glance at the little princess, Liu Zhuo noticed her mood seemed unsettled yet unusually happy and could not help but inquire, “Miss, what sort of man did He Pu say that person is? Why do you care so much about him?”

“A friend,” Shui Ling thought of Yang Kai’s face, recalled his various rudenesses toward her in Zhongdu, and suddenly ground her teeth. “A very detestable friend.”

Liu Zhuo was taken aback; if he was a friend, why would she call him detestable? He shook his head, baffled by the little princess’s thoughts.

But as the princess’s retainer he could not pry into her private affairs too deeply; his curiosity about the man grew. He had followed the little princess for years yet had never seen her display such changeable expressions.

About half an hour later two small black dots appeared in the sky. Shui Ling’s expression shifted and she strained to look, finally seeing He Pu leading a man speeding toward them.

As they drew closer, Shui Ling could at last make out the man’s features.

Her heart jolted; a veil of watery radiance quickly clouded her eyes.

He had not changed much from several years ago—only seeming a touch more mature, his body noticeably more robust.

Still in midair, Yang Kai spotted Shui Ling and suddenly accelerated, leaving He Pu behind; in the blink of an eye he had landed before her.

“Beauty, long time no see.” Yang Kai greeted with a cheerful, affable smile.

Shui Ling was one of the few friends he had.

“You bastard!” Shui Ling bit her lip, as if she could tear Yang Kai limb from limb, then charged forward and launched a flurry of punches and kicks.

He Pu and Liu Zhuo, who had been commanding the others in battle, were both left staring in astonishment.

They had never seen the little princess flirt and quarrel with a young man like this and were dumbfounded.

“What’s this for?” Yang Kai did not dodge; he let a few of her soft fists land and asked in surprise.

“Weren’t you dead? How are you alive again?”

“Who said I was dead?” Yang Kai snapped in anger.

“That beauty from the Duao Alliance said so,” Shui Ling snorted. “When I went to see her last time she told me you had been captured by someone and then vanished without a trace—so she figured you were dead!”

With so many people present, Shui Ling did not mention the Coffin-Bearer aloud; she obviously feared getting Yang Kai into trouble.

“Oh, that’s true.” Yang Kai nodded, neither denying nor confirming.

“Then how did you get away?” Shui Ling asked incredulously.

“Lucky, I suppose. He let me go.” Yang Kai gave a casual reply.

“The virtuous die young, but scourges linger on for a thousand years,” Shui Ling scoffed, lips pursed. “When that beauty told me she cried her eyes out like she’d lost her life. Is there something going on between you two? Otherwise why would she be so devastated if you died? When I left you two weren’t that close—tell me, what happened between you? You didn’t—hm?”

Seeing Yang Kai alive again made Shui Ling particularly delighted; she launched into a string of questions without pause, asking many unrelated things.

“You brat, why so many questions?” Yang Kai glared at her.

“Told you so.” Shui Ling wore an expression of disdain. “You lecherous scoundrel—wherever you go you pick up women. I shouldn’t have let that woman near you, I only brought her to harm!”

“It was an accident, purely an accident.” Yang Kai was mortified—he had been poisoned by the Divine Sense of an Enchantress and had been unable to control himself.

“Hmph, who’d believe you.” Shui Ling snorted, then quickly straightened and said solemnly, “In any case, you’re still alive—many will be glad of that.”

“You glad too?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, wearing a lecherous smirk.

“I’d rather you die sooner!” Shui Ling shot back angrily, her face reddening with fury.

He Pu and Liu Zhuo, witnessing this scene, were even more astonished; clearly the little princess and this young man shared an unusually close relationship—this fellow’s presence could make the princess abandon her usual decorum, which was incredible.

“There’s quite the commotion here.” Yang Kai swept his gaze across the waterside and saw a group of cultivators battling a massive Demonic Beast near the island; the fighters were no weaklings—one sat in the Transcendent Realm, the others were Divine Roaming Realm cultivators—yet the beast appeared to be Seventh-Tier. In the water it raged, its eight long fleshy limbs raising a mighty display, its attacks devastating, the water it struck hurling skyward.

The cultivators had carved many wounds into its flesh but could not slay it; pale blue blood welled from those wounds and the flesh writhed, healing itself in moments.

Yang Kai watched only a short while and knew that, at their level, these people could not kill the beast.

Its life force was simply too tenacious.

“Yeah, that monster seems to have an eye for a certain Spiritual Herb on Yunfeng Dao and has been stealing a lot,” Shui Ling said, anger flashing as she glared at the Demonic Beast.

“Miss, we’ll likely need to fetch more reinforcements,” Liu Zhuo said gravely, having perceived the dire situation.

Shui Ling nodded in silence.

“Why don’t you go up and help?” Yang Kai looked at Liu Zhuo in surprise. This man possessed cultivation at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm; if he ascended to aid those below, though it would take effort, they might be able to slay the sea beast—but Liu Zhuo remained on the ground commanding, showing no intention of joining the fray.

Liu Zhuo shot Yang Kai a look and snorted coldly: “If I go up, who will protect the miss’s safety?”

Yang Kai was taken aback and fell silent.

Shui Ling herself seemed only to have reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm and had not yet advanced into the Transcendent Realm; when she and Yang Kai separated three years ago she possessed this same cultivation, and now three years later she still could not break through that barrier—which showed how arduous it was to transcend that stage.
