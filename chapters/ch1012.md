## Chapter 1012 — Why Did You Have to Choose Me?

That formation, painstakingly constructed with countless Saint Crystals, turned out to be a spatial formation; the central gate had been forged from fragments of scattered warships, and the gate's edges were overlaid with a thin layer of Ethereal Crystal!

This layer of Ethereal Crystal was precisely the chief reliance for opening and sustaining the Void Passage, and it had been tempered from hundreds of Spatial Rings.

The reason Ghost Ancestor earlier seized everyone's Spatial Rings was exactly for the Ethereal Crystal contained within those rings.

Only now did Lü Guichen and Yue Xi understand what Ghost Ancestor intended—he planned to use this spatial formation to teleport himself away.

All sorts of doubts and anxieties crystallized into clarity the instant they saw the Void Passage.

But everyone present could see that the Void Passage produced by the spatial formation was extremely unstable and could collapse at any moment—could such a thing be used? And even if it could teleport someone, no one knew where it led. If one were sent into some rift of space, it would be better to remain on this continent; at least here the Spiritual Qi was rich and resources plentiful.

For a time, everyone fell silent.

Ghost Ancestor smiled and said, "Now it's your turn to help!"

At those words, everyone's hearts sank to their boots.

He seemed to want others to go in and reconnoiter...

Seeing through his intent, everyone's expressions changed.

"Senior, isn't that unwise?" Yue Xi cried out hastily, trying to argue the risks to Ghost Ancestor.

"Hm? What's unwise?" Ghost Ancestor looked at her coldly; that frigid aura enveloped Yue Xi like a canopy, instantly rendering her speechless.

"Do you think I prevented you from slaughtering one another for no reason? Do you think I let you gather supplies here for nothing? Hmph—if you weren't of use, I'd have killed you juniors long ago. The heroic spirits of my Ghost Banner won't tolerate your insolence!" Ghost Ancestor snarled viciously; at that moment his cruel nature bared itself and the gentle air around him turned bloodthirsty and grim. "Whoever dares utter another objection, I'll make them know my wrath!"

The people fell silent as if struck dumb. No one dared to utter another word.

With his might, even if he used force no one could resist, so everyone promptly behaved.

Ghost Ancestor nodded in satisfaction; his piercing gaze swept the crowd and everyone under it involuntarily lowered their heads, as if fearful of being singled out.

"Damn. Don't look at me. Don't look at me..." Shen Tu dropped his eyelids, tense, murmuring repeatedly like a charm to sway the old man's gaze.

"You! You brat, come here!" Ghost Ancestor suddenly pointed.

Everyone followed the direction of his finger; when they saw who he had indicated, their tension immediately eased and many even showed looks of schadenfreude.

"Shit!" Shen Tu's face darkened, cursing inwardly. He forced an awkward laugh and rubbed his hands nervously, saying, "Senior, are you talking about me? Surely not me, right?"

In that instant he wished he were dead; he resolved inwardly that if Ghost Ancestor truly chose him to test the spatial formation, he'd rather die than yield.

"The one beside you!" Ghost Ancestor shifted his gaze to Yang Kai.

"Me?" Yang Kai's face changed; pointing at his nose, he protested angrily, "Why me? There are so many people here—why pick me of all people?"

He was full of grievance. The Sword Alliance and Purple Star had nearly a hundred cultivators gathered here, yet Ghost Ancestor singled him out; he couldn't tell if it was ill fortune or that he was being specifically targeted.

Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly, "You brat look a bit restless."

"Is that the reason?" Yang Kai frowned and hurriedly said, "Senior, spare me—I'll promise to behave henceforth."

"Henceforth? There's no 'henceforth'!" Ghost Ancestor replied impatiently.

"Senior, you are truly wise!" Yue Xi curled her lips into a faint sneer and chimed in in a coquettish voice, her beautiful eyes glancing sideways at Yang Kai with obvious satisfaction.

Earlier Yang Kai had humiliated her; now misfortune had befallen him so suddenly that Yue Xi couldn't help feeling grateful to the old man—she longed to see Yang Kai writhe in pain, to relieve her grudge and avenge her disciple.

Yang Kai’s expression turned icy. He shot Yue Xi a cold glance and ground out through his teeth, “Wretched woman, I’ll remember you for this!”

Yue Xi snorted lightly, unconcerned and mocking: "If you live through today, then we shall speak."

“Senior truly possesses great foresight! My Purple Star will unconditionally comply with Senior’s arrangements!” Lü Guichen chimed in from the side.

As long as Ghost Ancestor did not choose their people, Lü Guichen and Yue Xi were indifferent.

“Everyone agrees, boy, so stop trying to decline!” Ghost Ancestor laughed heartily. With a wave of his hand, an irresistible force erupted from his palm, pulling Yang Kai toward him. In an instant, Yang Kai was dragged right before him, unable to muster any resistance.

Staring at the Void Passage opened by the spatial formation, Yang Kai's expression sank like still water.

He could feel that this Void Passage was entirely different from those he had seen before.

Those he had seen previously were often formed inadvertently by battles among ancient experts, but they had existed for countless years and long since stabilized.

But the Void Passage before him, framed by a gate, was extremely chaotic; the turbulence of the spatial currents pouring from within made even Yang Kai's heart palpitate.

If one rushed inside, peril would be everywhere; one might easily lose their way and never find an exit, trapped for a lifetime.

"I won't bind your strength, because there might be dangers inside. You go in and probe—if you can return alive that's best; if you do not return, don't blame me... hm, you can only wish yourself good luck!"

Saying this, Ghost Ancestor was about to hurl Yang Kai into the Void Passage.

"Wait!" Yang Kai urgently called out.

"What for?" Ghost Ancestor scowled at him.

"Senior, you only need me to go in and check the situation, right?"

"Correct!"

"Then how I do it should be my choice—please, senior, grant me the convenience to act in my own way!"

"Oh?" Ghost Ancestor suddenly wore an amused expression and appraised Yang Kai with interest. "What way do you intend? You should know tricks won't work before me."

"I don't intend any tricks." Yang Kai kept a stern face, inwardly displeased.

"How long will it take? I have no patience to wait." Seeming to think Yang Kai might die at any moment, Ghost Ancestor unexpectedly grew accommodating.

"No need to wait!" Yang Kai said, then suddenly sat cross-legged and called in a low voice, "Exit the body!"

With his low call, a wisp of faint spirit energy rose from his body—ethereal and shifting in form—and before long condensed into a likeness of Yang Kai.

"Spirit Body?" someone muttered; at a glance the hidden subtlety was revealed.

Lü Guichen, Yue Xi and the others all stared in astonishment.

Ghost Ancestor also smiled oddly.

No one had expected Yang Kai's chosen method would be to send his Spirit Body out from his shell.

He clearly intended to send the Spirit Body into the Void Passage to reconnoiter.

Did he not know a Spirit Body was immensely fragile and could not remain exposed outside its shell for long? Moreover, this was exceedingly dangerous—if someone used a Soul Technique on Yang Kai then, they could easily grievously wound him.

A Spirit Body without a shell's protection, no matter how strong, was like a hedgehog without quills—completely defenseless.

"Huh..." Ghost Ancestor's casual expression shifted to seriousness. He probed Yang Kai with his Divine Sense and his face turned peculiar.

He discovered Yang Kai's soul resided intact within his body; it was not the case of the Spirit Body having truly departed the shell.

Inspecting that Spirit Body more closely, Ghost Ancestor found it somewhat dull and mechanical, as if it lacked independent thought.

"Boy, what strange secret art have you cultivated to have two Spirit Bodies?" Ghost Ancestor cried in astonishment.

Even someone as powerful as Ghost Ancestor was taken aback by Yang Kai's method.

"Incarnation Technique!" Yang Kai replied calmly.

The Incarnation Technique was a divine art belonging to the Great Demon God!

Back when he had been in the Sacred Tomb of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Yang Kai had devoured and fused a drop of authentic Demon God Golden Blood; from that blood he had gleaned this divine art, and since then had been nurturing his Soul Incarnation—nearly ten years had passed.

This Soul Incarnation was nearing completion and would soon be of use.

But today he was forced to employ that Soul Incarnation simply to scout the Void Passage for Ghost Ancestor.

He felt a painful ache in his heart.

"Interesting, interesting—you truly surprise me." Ghost Ancestor inspected the Soul Incarnation with curiosity and found this incarnation of Yang Kai basically no different from a true Spirit Body, only weaker and lacking independent thought.

Strictly speaking, it was almost like a puppet; the only difference was the lack of a physical shell.

After watching for a time, Ghost Ancestor sneered, "This thing needs a proper shell to manifest power...not very useful by itself."

He immediately perceived the Soul Incarnation's shortcomings.

"Very well, act as you will." Ghost Ancestor said, and a wisp of resentful soul flowed from him, coiling around Yang Kai's Soul Incarnation and dragging the incarnation into the Void Passage.

He would be able to trace the entire process via feedback from that wisp of resentful soul.

Everyone held their breath, waiting silently for the outcome.

They knew that if this attempt failed, situations like this would occur a second time, a third time...

Ghost Ancestor would continue experimenting until he found the correct teleportation direction.

Today Yang Kai had been chosen; they felt schadenfreude and secretly rejoiced. Who knew who might be chosen next? It might be themselves, and then they'd be the unlucky ones.

In that instant, hearts were moved and everyone began to pray silently for Yang Kai's Soul Incarnation to return safely. Each person was devout; even Yue Xi, who had once wished Yang Kai dead, grew pale with anxiety.

Time trickled by.

The lights of the Saint Crystals flickered; the energy within was being rapidly consumed.

Beside the gate, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his expression shifting.

Ghost Ancestor stood beside him, his visage changing as well.

The light cast by the Saint Crystals rendered his expression unsettled and increasingly terrifying.
