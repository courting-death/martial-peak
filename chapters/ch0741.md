## Chapter 741 — The Great Ship at Sea

On the sea floated a small iceberg the size of a room; atop that berg, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his mood content.

Having found Su Yan and learned that Meng Wuya and Little Senior Sister were also safe and sound, Yang Kai felt considerably relieved.

Although he had not taken Su Yan away and had left her at the Ice Sect, with people like Qing Ya looking after her, Su Yan would only grow stronger there; when they next met, she would likely be even more formidable.

In high spirits, Yang Kai was in no hurry to travel; he rode the iceberg, slightly guiding it with his True Yuan to steer it toward the direction he desired.

Now with no lingering worries, his sole task was to return to Tianxiao Sect as soon as possible, improve his alchemy to concoct the holy pill to save the Ancient Demon Clan, and then go to that snow mountain to find the Coffin-Servant.

After Elder Li’s instruction, Yang Kai’s understanding of alchemy deepened considerably; using the Divine Sense Fire to refine pills was far quicker and more convenient than relying solely on True Yuan.

Moreover, aided by the recent soul-merging experience with Su Yan and combined with the techniques he had plundered from other experts through the World-Ending Demon Eye, he seemed to have gained some new insights.

Seated on the iceberg, enlightenment descended upon him like a cleansing rain; various truths of the Heavenly Dao and martial path darted through his mind like flashes of lightning.

Thoughts interwove at a speed surpassing light, he sensed and refined the path that belonged to him, his expression shifting with each new understanding.

The sea stretched vast and limitless; on this voyage Yang Kai encountered no disturbance, losing all sense of time and even forgetting his location, sinking wholly into that profound realm and growing stronger bit by bit.

Occasionally great sea beasts drifted under the iceberg, but Yang Kai had reined in all his aura so they did not detect him, and thus no trouble arose.

The clouds dispersed and the sky cleared; waves rolled beneath his feet, the heavens were high and the sea broad, and since arriving on the Tongxuan Continent, this was the first time Yang Kai felt how beautiful the world could be.

After a month or two of this, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, exhaled gently, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

This bout of insight had brought a notable improvement to his strength, but it also made him realize how arduous it would be to break through a single Stage in the Transcendent Realm.

One could say every Transcendent Realm expert had endured countless trials, teetering on the edge of life and death, fighting innumerable life-and-death battles to obtain their heights above ordinary men.

Those who could not endure such things would only live out a mediocre, unremarkable life, or die prematurely.

A deep meditation had also left Yang Kai with a much clearer understanding of the marvelous uses of the Divine Sense Fire.

The Divine Sense Fire is a mutated form of Divine Sense; whether used for offense or defense it is far more effective than ordinary Divine Sense, and it can even be used to deceive others.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense power was already strong enough that, by using it to cloak his body, outsiders seeking him might obtain false information and even underestimate his strength, leading to unexpected gains.

After a brief experiment, Yang Kai found it quite convenient: he only needed to slightly restrain the flow of his True Yuan and then use his Divine Sense to fabricate certain illusions to mislead others’ probes.

However, Yang Kai reckoned this trick could not fool those whose Divine Sense was stronger than his; anyone with superior Divine Sense could immediately see through such subterfuge.

Overall, Yang Kai was quite satisfied with what he had gained this time.

Rising on the iceberg to stretch his joints, Yang Kai scanned the horizon and saw nothing but the boundless ocean.

His face darkened as he muttered a curse.

Though he had consciously avoided sea beasts and other unknown dangers while cultivating, he had been so thoroughly absorbed that he had now lost some sense of direction.

Originally he planned to first return to the Water Divine Hall and pay his respects to Shui Ling; after all, Shui Ling had helped him this time and was one of the few friends he had—seeing her to offer thanks in person was only proper.

From the Water Divine Hall he would use it as a transit point to return to Tianxiao Sect.

But now his plans were somewhat disorderly.

After fretting for a while atop the iceberg, Yang Kai composed himself and calmed down.

As long as he could find some living people to ask for directions, everything could be resolved; thinking this, Yang Kai simply sat cross-legged again and, watching the sea roll, felt content.

Beneath the blue waves schools of fish swam in dense clusters, full of vigor.

Some brightly colored coral reefs also opened Yang Kai’s eyes to new sights.

Three days later, while Yang Kai was idly watching the clouds, the Divine Sense he released suddenly detected some life force intruding into his alert range.

Yang Kai’s spirit leapt; he rose and looked in that direction.

On the distant sea a small dark dot was passing by from the side, tens of li away.

It was a large ship; even at that distance Yang Kai could tell this vessel was no ordinary craft.

The ships that sailed the seas were not simple wooden vessels but had been alloyed with precious ores and specially forged, bearing traces of Secret Treasure craftsmanship; their defense could rival that of a rare Secret Treasure, and only such ships could withstand the frenzied attacks of sea beasts.

The Water Divine Hall possessed many such ships.

This particular ship was more splendid than the one Yang Kai had once ridden; its prow reared like a dragon’s head as it rode the wind and waves, surging forward at great speed.

On that great ship many brightly colored flags fluttered in the wind, clattering crisply.

Yang Kai roughly calculated the ship’s speed and direction and compared it to his iceberg’s course; he judged that in a while the two would pass each other within a dozen or so li.

He therefore increased the output of his True Yuan a little, making the iceberg move faster.

After a moment Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense; though he had not dared to probe closely, he had enough certainty to know there were no Saint Realm experts aboard—there were a few Transcendent Realm masters, and even some at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

With the Soul Devouring Worm in hand, Yang Kai was bold; without fear he stood atop the iceberg and shouted loudly to attract their attention.

Sure enough, after a while several figures appeared on the ship’s prow, staring toward his direction and pointing; they had clearly noticed Yang Kai.

But judging by their indifferent posture, they did not intend to respond to his calls, and the great ship’s speed and course did not change.

Yang Kai frowned; having waited so long for such a ship to pass, he certainly would not miss the chance—lost at sea as he was, he really did have to find someone to ask for directions.

Thinking this, the iceberg beneath him suddenly accelerated greatly and, dead ahead, charged straight for the great ship.

The faces of those standing on the prow immediately changed, and they shouted in alarm.

The crew, hearing the commotion, rushed out onto the deck to watch; among them were some Transcendent Realm experts.

Once the Transcendent master on the prow understood what was happening, his face flushed with anger and he waved a hand, barking, “What brash youngster is this, acting so recklessly? Break that ice mountain under him—how dare he threaten the ships of my Sacred Land? Ridiculous. Leave him alive for now; haul him aboard and question him properly; see where he comes from!”

At the Transcendent’s order the disciples were roused to righteous indignation; those on the prow immediately unleashed their Martial Skills and the power of their Secret Treasures.

Whoosh—whoosh—whoosh—several beams of energy shot from the ship’s bow.

Yang Kai was startled; unexpectedly they were so uncivil, and he quickly dodged into the sea.

With a thunderous crash, the iceberg that had carried Yang Kai across the sea for a month or two was instantly smashed to powder.

Chunks of ice scattered across the sea; those on the ship peered about carefully to search for Yang Kai’s figure, but found nothing and exchanged glances in puzzlement.

“Where is he?” The Transcendent asked, having lost sight of Yang Kai in an instant; when he tried to find him again he could not, and he asked with a sullen look.

The people all shook their heads.

One disciple said, “Could he have been ground to pieces? He looked young and didn’t seem very strong.”

“Nonsense!” the Transcendent barked. “Do you think a lone wanderer on this sea would be so weak? At the very least he’d be at the Divine Roaming Realm. If he had truly been pulverized, why is there no blood on the sea? That brat has surely hidden himself—search more carefully!”

“No need.” A slightly annoyed voice came from the ship’s rail; the next moment Yang Kai, dripping wet, clambered up from there and leapt onto the deck, frowning at those on board and saying with a sullen face, “Friends, we have no enmity, do we? Why did you suddenly attack me?”

“We had no intention of attacking you, only of breaking the ice mountain beneath your feet!” the Transcendent snorted. “Had we truly intended to harm you, would you be standing here at ease?”

Yang Kai frowned but said nothing further.

He had seen those attacks and knew they were not aimed at killing him; there was no murderous intent. His actions had likely caused them to misinterpret the situation.

That said, he had never intended for the iceberg to collide with their ship.

There was no point explaining now, so Yang Kai let it be.

“Kid, I’ll ask you a few questions—answer honestly. If you dare to hide anything, we’ll throw you overboard to feed the fish.” The Transcendent intoned sternly.

Yang Kai nodded, circulated his True Yuan to evaporate the seawater from his body, and adopted an unthreatening, compliant demeanor.

“Who are you, and how did you come to be stranded on an iceberg at sea?”

“I’m just a nameless nobody who accidentally got lost at sea and had to set foot on that iceberg, otherwise I would have drowned long ago.”

“Hmph.” The man snorted; Yang Kai’s lack of a direct answer seemed to leave him dissatisfied.

“Then what business do you have seeking out the ships of my Sacred Land?”

“With no other choice, I waited here for several days. Only today did I see your ship, so I came up to ask for directions. If it is convenient, I would also like to catch a ride and leave this sea area.”
