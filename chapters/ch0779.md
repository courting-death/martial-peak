## Chapter 779 — Benefits and Drawbacks

Xueli left; one of her underlings chuckled and ordered, "If you have anything to say, say it quickly—don't keep me waiting, my temper isn't good."

After saying that, he too walked out of the palace.

Only Yang Kai and An Ling'er remained inside the hall.

Her Highness the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land hurried over and fussed over Yang Kai with solicitous concern; Yang Kai repeatedly assured her he was fine, then asked after her condition.

An Ling'er smiled wryly and said, "That senior didn't trouble me much—she merely kept me by her side to attend to her—so you needn't worry about me. But you… why did you refuse Gou Qiong's ransom for us?"

"Do you think I shouldn't have refused?"

"I don't know, but that Xueli is no good; I'm afraid something bad will happen if I stay here too long."

"If she's not a good person, then Gou Qiong is worse," Yang Kai snorted coldly. "The reason I refused is because I need to find a way out."

"Huh? How so?" An Ling'er looked puzzled.

Yang Kai explained carefully, "If I accept his ransom, it's the same as owing him my life; if later he makes excessive demands, I won't be in a position to refuse."

"But… you also saved Gou Chi's life—wouldn't that cancel things out? A life for a life?"

"Are you stupid?" Yang Kai tapped her on the forehead. "That's exactly the problem."

An Ling'er rubbed her temples and complained, "Explain it more clearly—I don't get it."

"Ah…" Yang Kai shook his head and looked at her with a sigh. “It really wasn’t easy for you to grow up. It’s only thanks to your Nine Heavens Sacred Land keeping you sheltered within the Sect — had you gone out to wander alone, who knows how many times you would have died already.”

An Ling'er pouted.

"I did save Gou Chi, and that life-saving favor should have been our leverage to leave the Demon Domain, but it has become a fatal problem. Think about who Gou Chi is—his father is Gou Qiong, a Demon General. Didn't Xueli say when we arrived: a proud Demon General's son was actually saved by a human…"

"The implication is that he shouldn't have been saved, certainly not by a human. If I had complied with Gou Qiong's wishes and let him ransom me back, it wouldn't take long before I died on the road."

"Ah!" An Ling'er cried out, covering her mouth.

"Gou Qiong won't allow such a blow to his face and authority to spread. The best method is to kill and silence the matter—no witnesses, no proof that his son was ever saved by a human," Yang Kai said with a cold smile, a cunning light flashing in his eyes.

"That's just your suspicion, right?" An Ling'er still seemed unconvinced.

"Not a suspicion—fact!" Yang Kai declared. "Gou Qiong is a regional tyrant; he wouldn't be benevolent. When redeeming his son, he wouldn't just ransom the boy and harmlessly include us—know that he paid a hefty price. He's clearly harboring ulterior motives… If I'm right, there were already experts lying in ambush on the way home; the moment we show ourselves, we'll be ruthlessly intercepted."

An Ling'er's body trembled slightly, and she involuntarily felt grateful to have narrowly escaped death.

"Xueli knows this too! Yet she didn't warn me—this woman is truly venomous…" Yang Kai ground his teeth.

"No wonder she smiled so strangely when you refused earlier—so that's why," An Ling'er realized, and her admiration for Yang Kai swelled.

Had she been in charge, she would have gleefully left with Gou Chi, perhaps imagining how Gou Qiong would lavishly thank her for saving his son, never suspecting the ambush and murderous intent hidden there.

A chill of fear surged in her heart and she snapped in anger, "That Gou Chi is an ungrateful scoundrel—he should know his father's temper, right?"

"Hmph, he knows full well," Yang Kai sneered.

"Then he shouldn't have been brought out of the Small Xuan Realm in the first place!" An Ling'er fumed.

"That was my mistake. I only intended to use his identity and status, but cleverness backfired. Still, he served a purpose: at least he got us out of the Sand Sea. Without him we might have been lost there forever, and even after escaping we would have been pursued by other demons—it's unlikely we'd have had the chance to reach Sand City and the safety we have now."

Everything has advantages and disadvantages; it depends on one's perspective.

Gou Chi is indeed heartless and ungrateful, but he never meant to truly befriend him, so there's no need to be disappointed.

"Enough of that. Now we must consider how to survive under Xueli. You've been by her side—observe carefully for anything we can use. Perhaps an accidental discovery will give us a way out."

"Yes." An Ling'er nodded heavily, feeling an inexplicable closeness to Yang Kai.

After talking a while longer, Xueli's subordinate outside urged them; Yang Kai bade An Ling'er farewell and was led back to his room.

Time passed; everything was peaceful.

Ever since Yang Kai refused Gou Qiong's ransom, Xueli seemed to have forgotten him—he went two whole months without attention.

Yang Kai was content with the quiet; his days were spent meditating and communicating with the Divine Tree.

Over those two months the Divine Tree's intellect developed rapidly; it could now hold simple conversations with Yang Kai via divine thought.

It had absorbed much knowledge from Yang and its wisdom grew quickly—now roughly the intelligence of a six- or seven-year-old child: a little mischievous, but otherwise fine.

The Divine Tree had rooted itself in the Black Book Space, allowing Yang Kai to draw Yang attribute energy from it at will, and even replenish his Divine Sense—practically a portable, enormous energy reservoir.

After two months of cultivation, Yang Kai's power had significantly increased.

One day, when Yang Kai sent his Spirit Body into the Black Book Space, he suddenly sensed something amiss.

Some of the precious ores stored in his Black Book Space appeared to have gone missing.

Those ores had been collected from the starry sky after that storm; many such rare stones remained there—each extremely precious. He had planned to use them to forge secret treasures but hadn't found the time or a suitable craftsman.

Yang Kai wasn't clear on the exact count, but he keenly noticed there were fewer than before.

In the positions where the ores had been, only scattered fragments of worthless impurities remained—the essence had vanished.

Puzzled, Yang Kai sent his Spirit Body into the tree's heart and questioned the Divine Tree.

He had suspected the tree had secretly absorbed the ores' essence, but to his surprise the Divine Tree shook its head and denied any involvement.

Yang Kai couldn't help smiling and didn't press the matter further.

The Divine Tree's mind was like a child's; at that age, telling a lie was not uncommon.

Yang Kai did not blame it; in fact, if the tree needed those ores, he would have given them all.

"If those stones are useful to you, take them—I'll find more. Also, you can absorb a drop of that spirit liquid each day; it may aid your growth."

The Divine Tree brightened with joy, stretched a branch toward the Wan Yao Ling Ye and carefully drew a single drop; moments later it emitted a sound of comfortable contentment.

Yang Kai watched it with a smile, but then sensed someone approaching, quickly informed the tree, and withdrew his Spirit Body.

Just as he opened his eyes, the door was pushed open; Xueli's subordinate beckoned him and said coldly, "Come out—the Lady wants to see you."

Yang Kai frowned but obeyed, following the man.

He couldn't tell the man's exact cultivation, but from Xueli's regard for him and the pressure he felt, it was likely he was a Saint Realm expert.

Demons generally lived longer than humans, so he appeared no older than thirty—handsome and rakish, often wearing a world-weary smirk.

Only when facing Xueli did he adopt a solemn expression, daring no disrespect.

"What should I call you?" Yang Kai suddenly asked.

The man turned, glanced at Yang Kai and laughed lightly, "The Lady says you've got guts—you truly do! You seem to have no sense of being a prisoner under supervision."

Yang Kai shrugged and replied calmly, "Although I'm confined, you haven't harmed me in all this time, which means I'm still of use. What sense should I have?"

"The kid's clever—I like him!" the man chuckled, then after a moment said, "Call me Yu Mo."

"Your demon names are odd…" Yang Kai shook his head.

"I think human names are odd!" Yu Mo smiled.

"What does your Lady want with me this time?" Yang Kai asked.

"I don't know—maybe you have no value and they'll kill you off," Yu Mo said with a malicious gleam, casually whistling. "So you'd better be prepared—otherwise you may die fretting."

Yang Kai's mouth twitched, but his expression remained unchanged.

Yu Mo observed him and nodded inwardly, thinking this youth truly was different—most people would have panicked, but this one showed no worry.
