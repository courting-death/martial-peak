## Chapter 1796 — Feathers of the Divine Bird

Before the Divine Bird, the forces of the void surged and seethed; the collapsing, contracting rifts in space transmitted terrifying waves of power, and in a short while the rift-space that existed within the Lost Realm condensed into a single mass.

Yet it did not vanish completely; rather, before the Divine Bird a vast rotating vortex formed, semi-transparent like a mirror.

Through the mirror-like surface, scenes on the other side could be faintly made out.

On the opposite side, a figure was turning, looking around in confusion; if it was not Yang Kai, then who else could it be?

The Divine Bird saw everything clearly. It hesitated not at all, cried out once, flicked its wings, and plunged headlong into the vortex, its form then appearing on the other side of the mirror.

Once the Divine Bird left the Lost Realm, the crushing pressure it had brought with it dissipated instantly.

The Void King Realm experts who had earlier fled now reappeared, gathering not far from the vortex and staring at the scene on the other side with strange expressions.

Over there, Yang Kai was being pursued by the Divine Bird, frantically fleeing; his figure was growing ever more distant.

The space in which he and the Divine Bird existed looked uncannily familiar.

"The other side is the Star Domain?" Ni Guang's brow lifted as he recognized the area as the place they had entered from the Lost Realm.

"How could this be?" Ghost Ancestor was equally puzzled; no explanation came to mind.

Nearby, Zi Long's expression shifted as if in deep thought. He soon made a decision, whispered to Zi Donglai, then wrapped Zi Donglai in Saint Yuan and charged toward the vortex.

Xu Wei, constrained by his obligations, had no choice but to follow.

When the three of them dashed into the vortex and emerged on the other side, they immediately set off in pursuit of Yang Kai; judging by this, they clearly were not willing to let matters drop — after all, the Everlasting Tree was now in Yang Kai's hands, and if they caught him there was a chance to seize it.

"Uncle Ni, we go too," Xue Yue urged anxiously.

Ni Guang nodded. "It seems so. Exiting this vortex brings us to the Star Domain without a doubt, and there appears to be little danger there… then let's go."

As he spoke he glanced at Ghost Ancestor. "Friend, what are your plans…?"

Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly. "My Sect Master is being pursued; I would never stand idly by."

"Good. Then I, Ni, will go with you."

The two reached consensus and together charged toward the vortex.

Kong Fa, after a moment's thought, hurried to follow as well.

As Ni Guang had said, there was little benefit in staying; remaining would yield scant gain and might attract dangerous entities. It was better to pursue — perhaps luck would allow them to snatch something from Yang Kai.

Before long, everyone had vanished cleanly.

After a short while, a figure appeared furtively on the spot, face pale with alarm as he looked around — it was Meng Tong, who had departed early.

No one knew where he had been hiding; he only showed himself once the area had quieted.

Whoosh, whoosh……

The sound of something tearing through the void drew nearer from a distance.

"Is someone still here?" Meng Tong was startled and turned toward the source of the sound. A moment later, a beautiful figure entered his view.

Once he saw her clearly, Meng Tong offered a slight smile in greeting.

"Oh — Brother Meng?" The newcomer recognized Meng Tong and called out with delight.

"Elder Luo!" Meng Tong exchanged polite words; he knew her. She was Luo Lan of the Sword Alliance. Though not intimate, they had met before. Meng Tong was like this: he held no grudges against the other Void King Realm experts, nor did he cultivate deep friendships — he had always been solitary.

"What happened here? I caught sight of the Divine Bird from afar just now," Luo Lan asked curiously. She had seen the Divine Bird leave its nest, but she had been too far away; by the time she arrived, everything had settled, and she had no idea what had transpired.

"It's a long story," Meng Tong said with a bitter smile. "But there is an opportunity to leave now — Elder Luo, would you rather depart first and then discuss it?"

Luo Lan was taken aback, contemplating the vortex and then asking softly, "Leave through that vortex?"

"Yes. They've all gone; perhaps only you and I remain in the Lost Realm. I intend to leave as well," Meng Tong nodded.

"They're all gone?" Luo Lan was surprised, thought for a moment, then nodded. "In that case, I will accompany you out."

"That is excellent." Meng Tong smiled faintly and led the way toward the vortex.

After he and Luo Lan exited the Lost Realm and returned to the Star Domain, Meng Tong finally had time to briefly recount the earlier events to her.

When she learned that the Everlasting Tree had ultimately fallen into Yang Kai's hands, Luo Lan was greatly astonished.

After all, there had been so many experts present, including three formidable Void King of the Second Stage; yet in the end the one who prevailed was Yang Kai, an Origin Returning Realm cultivator — both ironic and unexpected.

Luo Lan could not help but remark on Yang Kai's extraordinary luck.

But the Divine Bird clearly had not given up; it had pursued Yang Kai from the Lost Realm into the Star Domain, and Yang Kai's situation must be perilous indeed.

"Yes, that's how it happened." Meng Tong fell silent after finishing his account.

Luo Lan watched the distance with concern; she did not know whether Yang Kai could escape. He had left a good impression, and he was someone Gu Jianxin wished to befriend — she naturally did not want to see him come to harm.

Yet the direction the situation would take was beyond her control, and Luo Lan felt powerless.

"Elder Luo, I will take my leave now. Farewell!" Meng Tong was cautious — though the Everlasting Tree tempted him greatly, he did not believe his luck sufficient to invite heaven-defying fortune, so he had no intention of getting entangled further; once out of the Lost Realm he would return to his abode to seclude and cultivate.

He had gained much on this trip; after some time in seclusion, even if he could not ascend, his strength might grow considerably with enough luck.

"Thank you for the explanation, Brother Meng. Safe travels!" Luo Lan inclined her head slightly.

"Farewell!" Meng Tong bowed slightly and turned to go.

After Meng Tong departed, Luo Lan sighed and, not planning to give chase, checked her bearings and set off toward Qingmu Star.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai was streaking across the Star Domain!

Behind him, the Seven Luminaries Peacock pursued like a gale, leaving him in despair.

Yang Kai could not know exactly how powerful the Divine Bird was or what realm it equated to, but judging from its relentless pursuit, its strength was certainly not below the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Even though he used spatial arts and moved continuously at great speed, he could not shake off its chase.

With a flick of its broad wings it could cover dozens to hundreds of li in an instant.

Yang Kai felt as if he were about to vomit blood.

The divine bird seemed to bear a hatred as deep as for a slain father or a stolen wife, relentlessly chasing after him. The distance between them widened and closed again and again, yet there was no sign he could shake it off.

What terrified Yang Kai even more was the fact that the Divine Bird would occasionally spew out the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; whenever it did he had to focus entirely on evasion, for even the smallest contact with that light could be disastrous.

This flight through the Star Domain with a powerful foe on his heels felt oddly familiar……

When Yang Kai had fled from Cuiwei Star, Luo Hai had pursued him similarly, chasing him across the Star Domain for half a year until Yang Kai reached Chi Lan Star and hid inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, whereupon Luo Hai finally lost his trail.

Now the Divine Bird had come to repeat that pursuit, and its power far exceeded Luo Hai's.

If Yang Kai's recent mastery of spatial forces had not improved so markedly, this time escape would have been impossible.

Time and again he mobilized spatial power and dodged the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; the situation looked desperate.

After countless attacks had achieved no effect, the Divine Bird appeared thoroughly enraged.

It no longer merely spat light; from its body it split off countless feathers of concentrated energy, which blanketed the sky and swept toward Yang Kai.

The divine lights were numerous and their attacks were exceedingly difficult to defend against.

Yang Kai suffered enormously.

The more than twenty Blood Beasts he had painstakingly condensed within the Lost Realm—several of them were already destroyed before he finally managed to evade danger.

Each Blood Beast represented a Golden Blood Thread; when a Blood Beast fell, a Golden Blood Thread was shattered.

Yang Kai felt as if his heart were bleeding.

A faint tearing sound suddenly came from behind; Yang Kai's expression changed. As he moved to dodge, he was horrified to find that this attack from the Divine Bird was different — swifter and more ferocious than before.

He could not afford the slightest carelessness. He spun around and waved his hands through the air.

The space before him, affected by his spatial power, suddenly split open into a circular rift.

No sooner had the rift taken shape than a beam of light tore through the void.

With a crash, the rift that had been formed by Yang Kai's mental strain was shattered; a fierce attack pierced through the gap and struck Yang Kai squarely in the chest.

Agonizing pain struck; Yang Kai felt his body about to be torn apart as something plunged into his front and shot out his back, trailing a spray of Golden Blood.

He was gravely injured, his expression suddenly slack.

Under the enormous inertia, his body flew backward like a torn sack.

In the midst of the chaos, Yang Kai looked down to assess his wounds and a cold sweat broke out on his brow.

As expected, something had pierced through his chest—but fortunately, it hadn’t struck the heart, merely grazing past the right side of his chest.

The wound was not fatal, but it was bad enough to leave him in dire straits.

A chilling sound rose — Yang Kai looked up and saw that around the pursuing Seven Luminaries Peacock floated a number of true feathers.

They were the Divine Bird's feathers; each was the condensed essence of its spirit and would not be used lightly.

This showed how determined the Divine Bird was to kill Yang Kai.
