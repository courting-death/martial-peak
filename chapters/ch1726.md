## Chapter 1726 — Rejected by the Laws

"Elder Qian was struck by lightning?" Yang Kai clicked his tongue in surprise.

"Mm." Qian Tong nodded. "Although I didn't suffer any serious injuries, the might of the heavenly thunder was still not to be underestimated."

Fei Zhi Tu gaped and exclaimed, "I thought you must have been cultivating some secret technique last time, and that's what drew the heavenly thunder—so it wasn't like that after all?"

"I never cultivated any secret technique!" Qian Tong said, half laughing, half crying. "Yingyue Hall has many secret techniques, you're well aware—what kind of technique would summon heavenly thunder? Besides, even if such a technique existed, I wouldn't have time to practice it; I'm barely able to consolidate my realm as it is."

"What about the earthfire last time?" Xuan'er asked from the side.

Fei Zhi Tu looked stunned. "What earthfire?"

Xuan'er blinked her big eyes and explained, "A couple of months ago, at our Master's secluded cultivation site, a terrifying earthfire suddenly erupted and reduced that place to ashes."

"There was such a thing?" Fei Zhi Tu was filled with astonishment.

"That's also because I was being rejected by the Star's laws!" Qian Tong said in frustration. "Since I returned to Dark Star, this has happened more than once. Although I've managed to resolve each incident, it keeps recurring, and I can't concentrate on cultivation. Moreover, when I traverse the air, a soul-scattering gale rushes into my Sea of Consciousness and eats away at my spirit power. Now I dare not sustain flight for long or fly too high for fear of provoking unbearable consequences!"

"Heavenly thunder, earthfire, gale..." Yang Kai clicked his tongue. "Elder Qian, your life has been hard indeed!"

Hearing Yang Kai's teasing, Qian Tong wore a look of wanting to cry but without a tear.

Those days were truly anxiety-inducing. Fortunately, Elder Qian had not closed himself off in seclusion recently; otherwise, if disturbed he could very likely suffer a Qi Deviation, and even if he were a Void King Realm expert, he would not be able to slip through such a crisis.

"How could such a thing exist!" Fei Zhi Tu said incredulously; having lived for several hundred years, this was the first time he'd ever heard of it.

"It's the first time for me as well," Qian Tong sighed heavily, then looked at Yang Kai with hope in his eyes. "Yang Kai, now that you are the lord of Dark Star, can you find a way to spare me these worries?"

He was truly troubled and had no idea when heavenly thunder or earthfire might strike, so he could not afford to enter seclusion; all his hopes were pinned on Yang Kai to devise a solution.

To his great disappointment, Yang Kai slowly shook his head. "I can sense the laws of Dark Star to some extent, but to break them is impossible."

Qian Tong sighed again upon hearing this.

The hall fell silent; everyone's expressions were rather grave.

Yingyue Hall had produced Dark Star's only Void King Realm expert. That had once been a great honor, but now that Elder Qian was being repelled by the star's laws, it was not good news at all.

After a while, Qian Tong suddenly spoke up, "It seems the only way is to leave."

"Elder Qian, you intend to leave Dark Star?" Fei Zhi Tu asked, aghast.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er likewise regarded Qian Tong with looks of unwillingness; they seemed to want to say something to dissuade him, but did not know how to begin.

"If I stay, I'll spend my life beset by these troubles and my cultivation will never advance," Qian Tong smiled faintly. "I struggled so hard to reach the Void King Realm; I don't want to be trapped at this level. I want to go higher, stand further, and see more splendid sights!"

"At your age and yet still so ambitious," Fei Zhi Tu said with a wry smile.

"Old Fei, are you content to remain trapped in the Origin Returning Realm for your whole life?" Qian Tong retorted.

"Of course not," Fei Zhi Tu snorted. "If not for my last demotion in realm, I would have left Dark Star with you. Whether or not I can glimpse the mysteries of the Void King Realm, I have to give it a try."

"Indeed—people strive upward as water flows downward!"

"Since you have decided, I have nothing more to say; rest assured about Yingyue Hall, I'll take care of it," Fei Zhi Tu said in earnest.

"Yang Kai, if I am to leave here, I will need to rely on your power," Qian Tong said, looking toward Yang Kai.

"That will of course not be a problem," Yang Kai smiled slightly. "In fact, I already had a plan I intended to implement recently; it aligns somewhat with your idea."

"What plan?" Qian Tong's eyes brightened at the words.

"I'm planning to lay a Space Array to another Cultivation Star."

"A cross-star, long-distance teleport?" Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu exclaimed in unison, stunned as they stared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded. "Dark Star has been sealed off for too long; it's time to go out and take a look. If this can be accomplished, then in the future when Dark Star's warriors reach the pinnacle, they can leave Dark Star to go elsewhere to comprehend the mysteries of the Void King Realm."

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu fell silent for a long time, their eyes wide with shock.

After a while, Qian Tong timidly asked, "Can such a thing be done?"

"Where there is a will, there is a way," Yang Kai chuckled. "At the very least, I see no problem with the method for arranging the Space Array."

Qian Tong's face showed concern. "But what if experts from other Cultivation Stars use the Space Array you arrange to invade Dark Star? What then?"

"Ha! You needn't worry about that," Fei Zhi Tu laughed, taking several tokens engraved with the character 'Ling' from his Spatial Ring and jingling them in his hand. "Without these, you can't activate the Space Array Yang Kai sets."

"What is that?" Qian Tong asked suspiciously.

"A Teleportation Token!" Fei Zhi Tu immediately explained. Once Qian Tong understood the token's purpose, his worries were lifted and he said thoughtfully, "Yang Kai, you planned these Teleportation Tokens a long time ago, it seems."

"Of course. Laying a Space Array on Dark Star is only practice," Yang Kai smiled.

His real objective was to link Dark Star with the Star Domain! This was not a whim but a scheme Yang Kai had long contemplated.

Traveling from Dark Star to the bustling regions of the Star Domain took far too long, but with a Space Array those problems would vanish.

Within Lingxiao Sect there were more than one peak expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and as Sect Master Yang Kai had to plan for their futures. He himself was already at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and urgently needed to leave Dark Star to prepare early for ascending to the Void King Realm.

Moreover, by arranging the Space Array Yang Kai could also cultivate his Spatial Force.

Over these days he had found his mastery of Spatial Force deepening.

It was a chance to gain multiple benefits at once, and Yang Kai naturally would not let it slip by.

"Very well, very well; with your thorough consideration, I can rest easy. Your being chosen as lord of Dark Star is the fortune of the whole Star!" Qian Tong laughed heartily.

"Elder Qian, will you leave with me now, or wait until I finish laying the Space Array and then be transported away?" Yang Kai asked.

Qian Tong pondered seriously for a moment and said, "I'll wait until you finish arranging the Space Array. I'll stay on Dark Star a while longer—there are still matters to handle here at Yingyue Hall."

"Then Elder Qian, wait for my good news," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

After the discussion was settled, Yang Kai did not linger long in Tianyun City but returned directly to Lingxiao Sect.

He summoned the sect's great elders and outlined his plan; Ye Xijun, Yang Xiuzhu and the others looked at him with excitement and voiced their approval one after another.

Ye Xijun needed no persuasion—she was the one on Dark Star most likely to ascend to the Void King Realm; only last time she had to remain at Lingxiao Sect to watch over Yang Yan, and thus missed the opportunity to leave with Yang Kai.

If Yang Kai truly could lay a Space Array onto another Cultivation Star, she would have the chance to break free from Dark Star's law constraints.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others shared the same hope; their failure in the Blood Prison Trial last time did not mean they were doomed forever. Ascension required relentless effort; even if they smashed into a wall, they would not turn back.

"Since there are no objections, this Sect Master will proceed," Yang Kai grinned and scanned the room. "But before that, I need your help gathering materials!"

"What materials?" Ye Xijun asked.

"Ethereal Crystals!" Yang Kai's expression turned solemn. "The key material for laying the Space Array is Ethereal Crystals. And depending on the transmission distance between the two Space Arrays, the number of Ethereal Crystals required differs. Since we aim for a cross-star, long-distance Space Array, the more Ethereal Crystals the better!"

"Very well—we'll handle it!" Ye Xijun nodded heavily.

Now that Lingxiao Sect and the whole Dark Star could communicate easily, gathering the materials was not difficult; the crucial question was how many Ethereal Crystals could be amassed.

After all, these things were exceedingly rare; even when found, they were often used to refine Spatial Rings.

Yang Kai had once possessed many, mined from beneath Dragon Lair Mountain, but he had long since consumed them cultivating his spatial power.

The Ethereal Crystals to be used now were all taken from the warehouses of the major sects and cities.

"Three months. Three months from now I'll leave Dark Star. I hope by then you will have helped me gather enough Ethereal Crystals!"

"Yes!" the great elders answered in unison and quickly dispersed to contact the sects across Dark Star.

It was believed that in three months Yang Kai would reap a considerable harvest.

The high ranks of Lingxiao Sect mobilized, while Yang Kai took a few days off to keep company with his parents and brothers, then he took Su Yan and Xia Ningshang and toured Dark Star.

He did not know when he would next be so free; he only hoped that within three months he could spend more time with these two Senior Sisters and savor a little more intimacy with his two women.

Such a life was, for him, nothing short of luxurious.
