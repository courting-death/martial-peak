## Chapter 2022 — Spatial Needle

Sensing that unique Power of the Laws, Yang Kai's eyelids twitched, and his expression grew somewhat grave.

The old woman said the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade was a byproduct born from a failed attempt to refine a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure; that proved true—otherwise an ordinary Void King-Grade Secret Treasure could not possibly produce such an effect.

Of course, being able to stir even this trace of the Power of the Laws was also thanks to Lu Baichuan himself having profound cultivation; his Origin Qi had likely already fully transformed, and he may even have brushed the threshold of the Dao Origin Realm, catching a glimpse of some of the Laws' mysteries.

Otherwise, if some other Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert had come here, even with the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade they could not have summoned such an imposing power.

That aura was the Law of Ice—subtle, elusive, almost impossible to grasp—yet it already belonged to a realm that only Dao Origin cultivators could touch. With this Secret Treasure in hand, Lu Baichuan’s combat strength was elevated by an entire tier.

Crack, crack...

The surrounding space showed faint signs of freezing; centered on where Lu Baichuan stood, frost rapidly spread layer upon layer across the ground beneath his feet.

The Lu family's Head suddenly bellowed, stamped a foot into the void, and his figure vanished from where he stood—only to inexplicably appear before Yang Kai the next moment and slash out with a blade.

The blade's radiance flickered with tremendous might, giving rise to the thought that there was nowhere to hide, and the icy intent emanating from the blade sealed off that section of space; Yang Kai was struck squarely by that blow.

"Hahaha!" Lu Baichuan laughed to the heavens, delight written all over his face. "Truly a mantis trying to stop a chariot—overestimating yourself!"

He had absolute confidence in that all-out strike; several Third Stage Void King Realm fighters had already fallen beneath it, and he believed Yang Kai could not possibly escape.

But at that moment his eyes narrowed and he stared forward in alarm.

Where Yang Kai should have been split in two he instead stood unharmed, without so much as a scratch. In his hand was a blunt, bladeless green longsword; within the sword something like a spirit snake writhed, parrying and blocking the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade's earth-shattering strike.

That chilling Power of the Laws, which had rendered Void King Realm experts helpless, had no effect on him. Yang Kai flicked the green longsword with a finger; a strange force spread out and in an instant dissolved the Ice Law to nothing.

"You…" Lu Baichuan cried in horror, his face changing wildly. "You can stir the Power of the Laws too?"

The Laws were an unfathomably profound force—the power of the heavens. In this world, aside from Dao Origin Realm experts, Void King Realm warriors could not use them. He had only glimpsed their secret thanks to the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade, and he had not expected Yang Kai to do even better.

Seeing Yang Kai so casually nullify his killing blow made it clear Yang Kai's grasp of the Power of the Laws surpassed ninety-nine percent of Void King Realm cultivators, even approaching Dao Origin levels.

Without the Law's aid, the strike from an upper-level Void King-Grade secret treasure was naturally something Yang Kai could handle with ease.

"The brat is hiding strength—damn!" Lu Baichuan shouted furiously.

Yang Kai laughed aloud, "You're the one looking down on others with your dog's eyes."

As he spoke, he pressed the Dragon Bone sword down; Lu Baichuan fell like a meteor from the sky, crashing directly to the ground.

Upon landing, Lu Baichuan immediately formed spirit seals; the earth thundered, and with several booming sounds three earth dragons burst from the ground, roaring as they waved their tails and charged at Yang Kai, stirring sand and stone.

"Earth Dragon Explosive Dance!"

Lu Baichuan roared, then twisted his body and, caring nothing for the lives of his own kin, fled at speed down the road.

"Sir Yang—he's getting away!" Zhang Ruoxi suddenly cried in a sweet, girlish voice.

During the fierce battle between the Lu and Zhang families, this little girl, only at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, had no ability to intervene and had stood at a distance watching; seeing Lu Baichuan show such cowardice, she could not help but shout a reminder.

"He won't get away!" Yang Kai snorted coldly; the Dragon Bone sword swept, and the green sword light cleaved those three earth dragons to pieces. With a flicker his figure vanished from where he stood.

Although he had no grudge with the Lu family, he had a promise with Zhang Gaoxuan and scorned Lu Baichuan's character, so he felt no qualms about making the Lu family his enemy.

Lu Baichuan's release of the three earth dragon secret techniques seemed only to buy time for his escape, but it failed utterly.

When Yang Kai reappeared, he was not far behind Lu Baichuan. As the Dragon Bone sword swept up its radiance and Yang Kai prepared to deliver a killing blow, the fleeing Lu family head suddenly spun and a crafty smile curled his lips.

While forming spirit seals, he flicked his finger at Yang Kai.

A strange fluctuation of force radiated out.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed sharply and his expression instantly turned odd.

In the next instant, he twisted his body and flicked his fingers forward to pinch at the air.

"Hahaha..." Lu Baichuan paused as if seeing something hilarious, sneering at Yang Kai, "You are seeking death."

“Oh?” Yang Kai cast him a sidelong, cold glance and waved his fingers before him.

Lu Baichuan's smile froze; his face twitched violently as he cried out, "Impossible, this is impossible! You cannot break the secret technique I cultivated my whole life!"

"Is that what you rely on? So you tried to make me lower my guard by fleeing earlier?" Yang Kai said, and with a forceful motion the strange power he had pinned dissipated into thin air.

Seeing this, Lu Baichuan's face truly changed; he realized he was no match for Yang Kai and that continuing would mean certain death. Without hesitation he fled into the distance, not daring to stay a moment.

"Interesting, Space Force," Yang Kai murmured, not pursuing at once but watching Lu Baichuan's retreating figure.

Earlier, Lu Baichuan had used his flight to lure him and then returned with a counterstrike of Spatial Force; though it could not match his Moon Blade's strength, it had formed a spatial needle.

Spatial Force was mysterious and hard to defend against; had he been careless, Lu Baichuan might indeed have landed his blow.

At that moment, even a tiny Spatial Needle could take his life.

Unfortunately, Lu Baichuan actually used Spatial Force right in front of him — flaunting petty tricks before a true master.

Glancing back, he saw the battlefield between the Lu and Zhang families thrown into utter chaos. The Zhang Family stood alone and outmatched; though they had fewer experts than the Lu clan, every one of them fought with a resolve to die, their strikes fierce and their wills unyielding.
Especially the old matron and the middle-aged woman—both at the First Stage of the Void King Realm—whose fighting style bordered on exchanging life for life, forcing the Lu family's group to suffer no small amount.

Yet their strength was far weaker; at this rate the Lu family would inevitably wipe them out given time.

Now Lu Baichuan had fled within less than half a cup of tea's time since engaging Yang Kai.

This terrified the remaining Lu family members, and naturally they lost heart and sought to flee as soon as possible.

Seeing this, Yang Kai flicked his hand and sent out dozens of Golden Blood Threads, which twisted and coalesced into three gleaming spears. The golden spears quivered in the void and then shot forward like lightning, each driving through a Lu family's Void King Realm warrior and tearing out a spray of crimson blood.

"I'll leave the riffraff to you; I'll pursue Lu Baichuan," Yang Kai said, and after badly wounding those three he retracted his Golden Blood Threads and flashed off in the direction Lu Baichuan had disappeared.

"Thank you, Young Brother!" the old woman cried, overjoyed; she and the Zhang family launched a furious counterattack.

The enemy's three strongest Void King Realm experts had been grievously wounded; this was their chance to avenge themselves. The old woman no longer hesitated, anger and gratitude toward Yang Kai swelling in her heart.

......

One hundred li northwest of the Zhang family manor in Fenglin City stood another estate larger than the Zhang's; above its main hall hung a plaque bearing the characters "Lu Mansion," clearly the Lu family's residence.

The Lu Mansion was filled with festive cheer that day—disciples and retainers busied about preparing for an upcoming wedding, yet none suspected disaster was about to strike.

It was not until Lu Baichuan suddenly appeared like a specter within the mansion's main hall that a few of the Lu family cultivators noticed.

"Family Head, didn't you go to the Zhang family to receive the bride? Why have you returned at this hour? The time is not yet right," an Origin Returning Realm Lu family warrior asked in puzzlement.

“Pass down my order—have everyone pack up at once and leave this place as quickly as possible!” Lu Baichuan barked the command, offering no explanation whatsoever before flashing inside in a streak of light.

"What?" The Lu family's high-ranking members exchanged baffled looks.

Although Lu Baichuan left few words, his expression made them suspect something terrible was imminent. They dared not disobey and, after a brief discussion, immediately issued orders below.

In the Lu family's rear courtyard, inside a small secret chamber, Lu Baichuan rushed in, retrieved a talisman, and opened the chamber's dozen or so seals before slipping within.

The chamber was not large, but it stored the family's treasures through the years. Especially the Source Crystals—over half the Lu family's Source Crystals were stored here.

In the chamber's center hovered a round jade of pitch-black color, slowly rotating, mysterious light flowing over its surface from time to time.

Lu Baichuan hurried to the round jade as soon as he entered, seemingly deeming this jade the chamber's greatest treasure.

He reached to take it, but suddenly detected an odd aura and froze, spinning to shout, "Who!"

At that instant he sensed behind him an inexplicable presence and a life fluctuation.

"Eh..."
