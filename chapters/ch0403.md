## Chapter 403 — Wait for It, I'll Remember You

Huo Xingchen is the only son of the Huo Family Head Huo Zheng, who is a tragic figure in his own right. As the head of one of the Eight Great Families, he has countless wives and concubines, indulging night after night. Yet after so many years, he has only one son and numerous daughters, enough to form a legion of beauties.

In this respect, he shares a peculiar similarity with Hu Man, the leader of the Blood Battle Gang.

However, he is more fortunate than Hu Man, as he at least has a son to carry on the family line.

Because he is the family's only seedling, Huo Xingchen has enjoyed immeasurable favor since childhood. He has been given anything he desired, and the entire Huo Family revolves around him, which has cultivated his rather unique personality.

Before the younger generation of the Yang Family returned to Zhongdu, three young talents dominated the city.

The first was Liu Qingyao from the Liu Family, known for his extraordinary potential; the second was Qiu Yimeng of the Qiu Family, who was not only extremely beautiful but also skilled enough to overshadow many others, a dazzling beauty indeed.

The third is this Huo Xingchen, known as the number one dandy of Zhongdu. He excels at drinking, gambling, and seeking pleasures, and he thrives on bullying the weak and causing mischief.

Other families may support some underground forces, but they never let their own family members manage them or get involved in the conflicts between these factions. Yet, this Young Master Huo, bored out of his mind, insists on showing up at every battle involving his subordinates, watching from a safe distance to relieve his boredom.

With two powerful protectors on par with Blood Servants guarding him, Huo Xingchen had never worried about his safety. However, he never expected to be blindsided this time, despite having two guardians watching over him, only to find a sword pressed against his neck.

Instead of feeling dejected, Huo Xingchen looked thrilled. Even as he spoke with Yang Kai, he quietly gathered his True Yuan, waiting for an opportunity to escape from Yang Kai's grasp.

The thrill of danger made his blood boil with excitement, and he felt an irresistible urge to unleash a long howl.

Sensing his agitation, Yang Kai glanced at him with a strange expression. He exerted slight pressure on the Scarlet Blood Sword, drawing a crimson line on Huo Xingchen's neck.

“Damn it!” Huo Xingchen couldn't help but curse, “I already said I'm Huo Xingchen from the Huo Family! How dare you treat me like this?”

Startled, he quickly dispersed the gathering power, fearing that the person behind him might actually kill him. He enjoyed thrills but did not disregard his own life.

“Who the hell are you?” Huo Xingchen began to realize something was off. His name echoed throughout Zhongdu; how could someone dare to treat him this way if they did not have some status?

The two Divine Roaming Realm protectors finally noticed something unusual. One of them cupped his fists and asked solemnly, “May I ask which Young Master Yang you are?”

The young man before them was unfamiliar, and they had never seen him. However, judging by his demeanor, he must be from one of the Eight Great Families.

Only the return of the younger generation from the Yang Family would make someone unrecognizable to them!

“Yang Kai!”

“Ah, so it's Young Master Kai!” The two acknowledged, quickly cupping their fists in respect.

Yang Kai's expression was cold as he nodded slightly.

During their exchange, the battles below had already ceased. With their master’s life being threatened, the members of the Xuan Guang Association dared not make any further moves, retreating from the battlefield and awaiting instructions.

Pang Chi and others, having survived the ordeal, gasped for breath, gathering together as they looked up at the roof in astonishment, their faces reflecting a mixture of relief and disbelief.

They never expected that the new master, who had been wreaking havoc in the main hall just days ago, had come to rescue them, and he came alone!

What astonished them even more was that he had actually succeeded!

Having recognized Yang Kai's strength long ago, Pang Chi now realized he had underestimated him.

“Young Master Kai,” one of the Huo Family experts pondered, “Could you release my young master before we continue our discussion? Rest assured, we will not take any further action.”

Another expert nodded in agreement, his expression serious.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, contemplating for a moment before retracting the Scarlet Blood Sword.

He wasn't worried that they would go back on their word; both parties understood this unspoken agreement.

Upon gaining his freedom, Huo Xingchen immediately leapt several steps forward, then turned back to scrutinize Yang Kai. Upon recognizing Yang Kai’s face, he couldn't help but shout, “What? So young! How old are you?”

His voice contained a deep sense of defeat, as if Yang Kai should not be younger than him.

Yang Kai merely watched him with cold eyes, remaining silent.

“Hey, hey, I'm talking to you!” Huo Xingchen persisted, feeling frustrated.

“Young master,” the Huo Family expert sighed helplessly, pulling him back to his side. Until they understood Yang Kai's temperament, they were unwilling to let Huo Xingchen provoke him further.

“Let’s discuss the situation here,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

“Please speak, Young Master Kai; we are all ears,” the two experts responded.

“Pang Chi!” Yang Kai called to the man below.

Pang Chi was startled, quickly leaping up and cupping his hands, “Your subordinate is here.”

“Count the casualties.”

“Understood!” He replied urgently and promptly shot back down to begin tallying.

In the aftermath of the battle, the scene was chaotic, with members of the Xuan Guang Association and Bamboo Segment Gang clearly delineated; though animosity remained, they could not engage further.

Huo Xingchen examined Yang Kai with great interest, a faint smile hanging at the corners of his mouth, while Yang Kai stood there quietly, waiting.

The two elderly experts from the Huo Family were secretly alarmed by his calm demeanor.

After a while, Pang Chi returned, wearing a sorrowful expression, and reported, “Sixty-eight disciples from the gang have died, and one hundred eighty-nine are injured!”

Yang Kai directed a cold gaze towards Huo Xingchen.

The latter shrugged nonchalantly, “Just draw a few lines, and we’ll compensate!”

“Fifty thousand taels for each dead, ten thousand for each injured. You can pay in spirit pills or even heavenly treasures!” 

“Are you trying to rob us?” Huo Xingchen shouted.

Though he was the sole heir of the Huo Family, Yang Kai's demands were a bit much for him. If calculated this way, it would cost millions.

“Isn't that too expensive, Young Master?” a Huo Family expert chimed in, clearly astonished at Yang Kai's greed.

“No room for negotiation,” Yang Kai replied firmly.

“I won’t pay!” Huo Xingchen retorted defiantly. He had never felt intimidated by anyone over the years.

Yang Kai chuckled quietly and strangely, “Do you think you have a chance to bargain?”

As soon as the words fell, a floral scent suddenly wafted through the noses of everyone present.

A red glow suddenly blossomed from the center of Huo Xingchen's chest, radiating hundreds upon thousands of faint red lights that enveloped him completely.

Swish, swish, swish…

Countless flower petals danced around Huo Xingchen, sealing him within. Each petal was sharp and emitted a chilling aura of death. Cold sweat instantly seeped from Huo Xingchen's forehead.

The two Huo Family experts turned pale.

They had not realized when Yang Kai had laid his traps on Huo Xingchen. These thousands of flower petals were obviously a lethal secret treasure, placed on their young master without them knowing.

The two experts could no longer afford to underestimate Yang Kai, nor could they simply compare him to ordinary young people; such methods were frightening indeed.

“Do you dare to kill me?” Huo Xingchen stubbornly held onto his bravado.

“I could let you lie in bed for a year and a half,” Yang Kai huffed coldly, prompting Huo Xingchen to fall silent.

Sensing Yang Kai's icy demeanor and impatience, one Huo Family expert quickly said, “Young Master Kai, we concede. We will agree to your compensation! Please spare my young master for now.”

“Do not test my patience again,” Yang Kai said with a cold smile, an unmistakable warning in his tone. 

“Absolutely not!” the man nodded solemnly.

The flower petals finally converged into a single red light before vanishing back into Yang Kai's body.

The three from the Huo Family let out a collective sigh of relief, while Huo Xingchen's expression darkened, lost in thought.

One of the Huo Family experts pondered, eyeing Yang Kai thoughtfully, “It seems Young Master Kai is showing signs of a breakthrough.”

Upon meeting his gaze, Yang Kai nodded calmly.

He was already at a bottleneck stage, and today's battle seemed less perilous but swiftly determined the outcome. However, with the two Huo Family members present, Yang Kai felt considerable pressure.

Unexpectedly, under this pressure, his bottleneck was shattered.

Seeing him acknowledge it, the two Huo Family experts inhaled deeply, while Huo Xingchen gazed at him in shock, envy flickering in his eyes.

“Young Master Kai, your breakthrough is of utmost importance. You need not worry about the matters here; it was merely my young master’s whim. We will handle it!” 

Hearing this, Pang Chi and Mu Nandu exchanged helpless but amused glances. Lives had been lost on both sides, yet it was all because of a bored dandy. To these young masters, lives truly did not matter.

“Alright,” Yang Kai agreed, knowing he had little time to linger and discuss further. He swiftly darted towards the Bamboo Segment Gang's main hall.

“Yang Kai!” Huo Xingchen suddenly called out from behind.

Yang Kai paused and turned his head back.

“You're going to participate in the struggle for succession, right?” Huo Xingchen asked with a smile.

“Indeed!” 

“Good, good, good!” Huo Xingchen laughed heartily, “Wait for it; I’ll remember you. I’ll join as well!” 

Yang Kai made no comment as he vanished into the main hall.

Once Yang Kai's figure faded from view, Huo Xingchen sneered coldly, “Interesting, very interesting!”

A Huo Family expert quickly consoled, “There’s no need to be angry, young master. As long as you position yourself correctly during the struggle for succession, you’ll regain your standing. By then, he will know that offending you today was a foolish move.”
