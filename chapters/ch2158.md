## Chapter 2158 — Illusory Formation

Gong Wenshan muttered to himself as he walked over in that direction.

Kong Qi was momentarily stunned on the spot.

He had indeed come over to ask Gong Wenshan to check if there were any restrictive formations at the exit, but he hadn’t expected the other party to agree so readily, without the slightest hesitation.

This didn’t match Gong Wenshan’s usual conduct and personality at all…

Thinking of this, Kong Qi’s expression changed slightly. He quickly strode after him, saying, “How can I let Brother Gong take such a risk alone? I, Kong, am willing to accompany you. As brothers, we must share both hardship and joy!”

“Are you sure?” Gong Wenshan tilted his head, looking at him with a teasing expression.

“Uh…” Kong Qi’s mind was a jumble of thoughts, mainly because the other’s expression was too hard to read, making him feel uncertain and at a loss for how to answer in a way that would satisfy him. In the end, he gritted his teeth and said, “I’m sure.”

“Alright then.” Gong Wenshan shrugged and continued forward, saying, “Just stick close to me.”

Hearing this, Kong Qi was overjoyed, knowing his answer must have been correct, though he kept a calm face and said, “Of course, of course. Brother Gong, be careful.”

As the two spoke, they walked together under everyone’s watchful eyes to the only exit.

At this moment, the cultivators meditating and resting in the hall were all closely watching Gong Wenshan’s actions, afraid to miss anything. Gong Wenshan’s ability to break restrictions had already been witnessed by everyone before. If there was a hidden formation at this entrance, he would surely be able to see through it.

For a moment, everyone held their breath, waiting for the result.

Gong Wenshan stood in front of the entrance, carefully observing, his expression constantly changing, making those around him anxious. After a long while, he finally said leisurely, “As expected, this entrance is just an ordinary one. There’s nothing dangerous!”

With that, he walked straight toward the entrance.

Kong Qi hurried to follow.

In the blink of an eye, the two disappeared into the entrance, their traces gone.

“Putting on airs!” Xiao Chen snorted discontentedly. Earlier, seeing Gong Wenshan’s changing expression, he thought he had discovered something, but in the end, it turned out like this, leaving him feeling played.

Lan Xun smiled slightly and said, “This Brother Gong… is quite the arrogant genius!”

“By the way, did you notice…” Xiao Baiyi suddenly came over to the two, glanced around, and said gravely, “Wuchang isn’t here!”

Xiao Chen frowned. “What do you mean? What does it matter to us whether he’s here or not?”

Xiao Baiyi glanced at him, then looked away, turning his gaze to Lan Xun.

“What’s with that look? Are you looking down on me?” Xiao Chen was immediately displeased.

Lan Xun’s brows furrowed as she seemed to think of something, pondering, “Brother Xiao Bai means… Wuchang couldn’t enter here because of something Gong Wenshan did?”

Xiao Baiyi nodded solemnly. “That’s exactly what I think. Gong Wenshan can break restrictions, so perhaps he can also control them. Almost everyone else made it in, so there’s no reason Wuchang couldn’t. There’s only one explanation for this—Gong Wenshan didn’t let him in!” At this, Xiao Baiyi sighed and looked sincerely at Lan Xun. “Your Highness, I am Xiao Baiyi of Qingyang Shrine, not… Brother Xiao Bai!”

“I know…” Lan Xun pressed her lips into a smile. “But you and Brother Xiao Chen share a surname, so I wasn’t sure how to address you. And that Yang Kai just now called you Xiao Bai, so I simply followed suit… Does Brother Xiao Bai mind it?”

“Not at all!” Xiao Baiyi flatly denied it, a cold glint flashing in his eyes as he said icily, “Once we get out, I’ll tear that guy’s mouth apart!”

“If you keep dawdling, everyone else will be gone. Let’s get moving.” Xiao Chen, unable to get a word in, could only change the subject.

Lan Xun turned to look and saw that most of the cultivators in the hall had already left, leaving only a few of them standing there. She nodded, “Let’s go too.”

Xiao Baiyi exchanged a glance with Murong Xiaoxiao, and the two immediately used their movement techniques to rush toward the entrance.

…

“Damn, it’s a trap!” As soon as Yang Kai rushed into the entrance, he couldn’t help but exclaim.

The world before his eyes suddenly twisted and changed, transforming into a vast grassland.

The grassland was lush and teeming with eagles, stretching endlessly. In his view, there were blue skies, white clouds, and verdant grass—a beautiful environment, but clearly not a scene that should exist in the Time Temple.

“An illusory formation?” Yang Kai frowned, standing still.

He wasn’t too surprised by the scene—he'd vaguely sensed something like this might happen before coming in.

The reason, naturally, was Gong Wenshan.

Judging from how he dealt with Wuchang earlier, Gong Wenshan was definitely not as easygoing and calm as he appeared. On the contrary, this guy couldn’t stand the slightest loss and was full of tricks.

Wuchang had only tossed a couple of threats his way, and Gong Wenshan promptly barred him outside the Time Temple, forcing him to watch, helpless, as everyone else filed in—left to stew in his own anguish. It was clear this man repaid every slight in full.

When Kong Qi asked him to check the only exit, Gong Wenshan agreed so readily that Yang Kai felt something was off.

Gong Wenshan wasn’t the type to make sacrifices for others. His personality simply lacked noble selflessness.

Of course, that was only human nature.

Sure enough, this entrance wasn’t as Gong Wenshan claimed. Instead, there was a surprise waiting for everyone.

The only question was whether this illusory formation was set up by Gong Wenshan himself or if it was part of the Time Temple.

If it was the former, that would be easier to handle. Even if Gong Wenshan was a formation master, he couldn’t set up a profound illusory formation in such a short time. Maybe he just used a Formation Talisman to hinder those who came after.

If that was the case, then this illusory formation could be broken quickly, given Gong Wenshan’s strength.

But if it was part of the Time Temple itself, that would be terrifying.

Even Gong Wenshan hadn’t noticed anything before, charging in with full confidence. If even someone like him was fooled by the formation’s subtlety, how could anyone else break it? They might be trapped here forever.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming his nerves and reassuring himself, “Let’s hope it’s just Gong Wenshan’s trick…”

As he spoke, he slowly closed his eyes, and as his words fell, he suddenly opened them again.

In his left pupil, a golden vertical slit appeared, majestic and solemn, as if it could pierce the void and see through all illusions!

Yang Kai slowly turned his head, sweeping his gaze around. A moment later, he let out a quiet breath, relief softening his expression.

At this point, he was certain that this illusory formation wasn’t part of the Time Temple, but was set up by Gong Wenshan on the spot. With his World-Ending Demon Eye, he quickly found the weak point of the formation and saw through the illusory scene.

After thinking for a moment, he didn’t break the formation by force; instead he walked out along the weak point.

Meanwhile, in a nearly identical illusion, Lan Xun held a Luminous Pearl-like object in her hand. The Luminous Pearl emitted a gentle light, dispelling the illusory scene around her and casting a clear beam ahead, guiding her forward.

Xiao Chen followed closely behind her, snorting, “It’s just an illusory formation. I could break it directly. Your Highness, why go to such trouble?”

Lan Xun pressed her lips into a smile and said, “It’s only right to let others have their way. Gong Wenshan burned a Formation Talisman to lay this illusion just to slow everyone down—if we shatter it, won’t they all come pouring out? I’m not doing a losing deal like that; it’s not as if they’ll reward me for it.”

“Your Highness…” Xiao Chen stared at Lan Xun’s back in astonishment. He never expected that after just a few days out in the world, the once pure and kind princess had been tainted by it. For a moment, his heart ached terribly!

On the other side, Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao both had their eyes closed, groping through the illusory formation like blind people. Their direction seemed casual, but they were actually making their way out bit by bit. No one knew how they managed it.

“An illusory formation? Ridiculous! In the face of absolute power, everything is trash!” Luo Yuan had always believed in the supremacy of strength. Even after falling into the illusory formation, he showed no fear, mobilizing his Origin Qi and unleashing his strongest moves in all directions.

But those attacks, powerful enough to shatter Dao Origin Realm cultivators, didn’t even cause a ripple when they struck the surroundings, as if they had sunk into the sea.

Although this illusory formation was hastily set up by Gong Wenshan with a Formation Talisman, it wasn’t something that could be broken by brute force. The Gong family was a family of formation masters, and before setting up the formation, Gong Wenshan had already taken the strength of Luo Yuan and the others into account, ensuring that even if they tried to break it by force, it wouldn’t be done in a short time.

The reactions of these top experts were basically the same as those of other Dao Origin Realm cultivators who fell into the illusory formation.

Those who knew a bit about formations would try to find the Formation Core and break the formation.

Those who didn’t could only try to break it by force.

But like Yang Kai and Lan Xun, those who relied on special powers to find the weak points of the formation could easily walk out of it.

In less than the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, Yang Kai had already walked out of the illusory formation. His vision twisted and changed again—the blue sky and white clouds vanished, replaced by a deep, dark passage.

Yang Kai immediately withdrew his World-Ending Demon Eye, pushed off with his foot, and shot to the bottom of the passage.

Looking ahead, Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown. “So many forks?”

Ahead, the passage split into at least a dozen forks. Each hid its depths from sight, each breathed a chill that crept up the spine—as if every path led to a road of no return.
