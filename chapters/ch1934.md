## Chapter 1934 — At the End of the Road

"What the hell is that?" Yin Lesheng's eyes flickered as he stared at Xiaoxiao for a moment, his expression one of astonishment.

Even with his vision, he could not tell whether Xiaoxiao was a living being or a puppet.

The Stone Puppet race was far too rare; if Yang Kai had not been guided by Yang Yan, he probably would still not know Xiaoxiao's origin. Although Yin Lesheng had roamed the Great Wilderness Star Domain for countless years, there were always things in this world he did not know.

The Stone Puppet was one of those things!

Transforming into a Stone Giant, Xiaoxiao was already unimaginably strong, and wielding a Heaven-Shaking Pillar weighing several hundred thousand jin, that berserk force was enough to smash the void.

Landing a hit, Xiaoxiao did not pause and once more hefted the Heaven-Shaking Pillar and slammed it down.

"Bind!" Yin Lesheng shouted low, and his Domain Field surged forth, intending to use the Domain Field's might to influence Xiaoxiao's actions.

His plan failed; Xiaoxiao moved within his Domain Field without hindrance, and instead obscure, unfathomable forces swirled about Xiaoxiao's body, tossing Yin Lesheng's Domain Field into utter chaos.

"Could this be... Law Force?" Yin Lesheng's face twisted as he sensed the strange power emanating from Xiaoxiao, his expression one of disbelief.

Law Force was the type of power only cultivators of the Dao Origin Realm could perceive—an ascended refinement beyond the Domain Field. Even he had not mastered it, yet now he had seen it in an unknown existence that was part puppet and part living being.

He was stunned beyond belief.

"Did you also devour some origin?" Yin Lesheng's gaze went cold and sharp as he instantly guessed a possible reason why Xiaoxiao possessed Law Force, bellowing, "So what if it's Law Force? Incomplete, shattered power dares act presumptuously before this Lord—get out of my sight!"

As he roared, he suddenly formed hand seals, and a mighty external force rapidly condensed around him as he intoned, "Nether Prison—Bone Spear!"

A colossal jade-white skeletal spear bizarrely materialized before him; that flawless bone spear exuded a grim aura, trembling slightly in the void before it vanished.

The next moment the bone spear appeared before Xiaoxiao.

Boom...

The bone spear struck Xiaoxiao's chest, bone dust exploding. Xiaoxiao roared and was hurled away by a tremendous force, rocks scattering from his body. He appeared badly injured, and in the blink of an eye his trace was gone; nobody knew where he'd been sent.

A shriek rose from the heavens—Fire Bird's cry—and countless feral thunder-fires rained down like arrows from the sky, engulfing the area where Yin Lesheng stood.

"Mutated thunder-fire. It seems you've refined quite a few extraordinary fires of heaven and earth!" Yin Lesheng glanced at the Fire Bird and curled his lips in a grim smile. "Not bad. I just happen to be short one Artifact Spirit—you'll do nicely!"

He could tell at a glance that Liu Yan's true form was an Artifact Spirit born with sentience — a testament to how sharp and ruthless his perception was.

Speaking, he beckoned and reached to seize the Fire Bird.

In the void a colossal palmprint suddenly appeared, blotting out heaven and earth, forming five finger-sized mountains that pressed down on Liu Yan.

Liu Yan was wildly alarmed; she beat her wings and hurriedly dodged from where she stood.

But that giant palmprint seemed alive, shadowing Liu Yan no matter where she fled, and in the end the palm struck her down with a single slap.

The palmprint turned into a cage, imprisoning Liu Yan within. She cried out, spewing thunder-fire as she scorched at the prison to break free, but from the looks of it she would not escape any time soon.

At that moment, Yang Kai appeared before Yin Lesheng like a specter; if it were not for the Netherworld Domain Veil blocking him, Yang Kai would have been pressed right up against him.

Yang Kai's expression was solemn; his right arm, transformed by Dragon Transformation, gripped the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade, channeling all his strength and bringing it down in a brutal slash.

"Ant, do not bother me!" Yin Lesheng roared, murderous qi contracting into a vast phantom of a human head that opened its mouth and unleashed a furious shout at Yang Kai.

An invisible force smashed through Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness defenses, tossing his mind into turmoil and making him stagger and grow faint.

Such a powerful Divine Sense assault?

Yang Kai's heart sank; he realized that if he did not fight with everything he had this time, death would be inevitable.

This Yin Lesheng was not the strongest enemy Yang Kai had ever faced, but he was absolutely beyond Yang Kai's match. Though Wu Shengfeng had once been far stronger, Yang Kai had Yang Yan's help then; Wu Shengfeng was no match for Yang Yan.

Now, everything depended on himself alone.

He gritted his teeth against the disorientation in his mind, poured all his strength into the Dragon Bone Sword, and struck the Netherworld Domain Veil.

A reverberation sounded, and Yang Kai was flung away, suspended midair, bloodied and miserable to the extreme.

"Still resisting?" Yin Lesheng regarded Yang Kai coldly, his face confident. Only after Yang Kai landed did he leisurely say, "Your talent and ability would be top-tier in your Star Domain, perhaps rivaling this Lord himself, but... you appeared at the wrong time in the wrong place; this is your fate, boy—accept it, and obediently let this Lord subdue you!"

Yang Kai forced his body upright, looked toward the nearby battlefield, and his expression turned icy.

Over there, Ghost Ancestor and the other four fighting together still could not contend with Feng De and Liu Qianyun.

It was not a matter of realm cultivation so much as a disparity in internal power; those three Great Wilderness Star Domain experts had remained in the Starlight Passage for five years, spending that time converting their internal strength.

And what of Yang Kai and his companions?

They had only been here a little over a month.

How could they be compared?

That was why the other side had been routed so quickly. Ghost Ancestor and the others were already in dire straits: Ghost Ancestor's condition was terrible—black qi had been scattered and his form flickered; Ai Ou's abdomen bled profusely from grievous wounds; Chi Yue's Heavenly Moon Demon Spider apparition dimmed; Wudao's face was pale; Gu Cangyun coughed up blood without cease.

They had truly reached the end of the road!

The bald man struck with brutal ferocity, while the woman seemed to hold back somewhat.

Even so, Ghost Ancestor and the others could not hold out much longer.

As for his two aides—Xiaoxiao had been sent flying somewhere unknown, and Liu Yan was trapped in the cage still struggling. She had no immediate life-threatening danger, but if he were defeated, she might be stripped of her consciousness and forced into his Secret Treasure to become his Artifact Spirit.

Six had traveled together with boundless longing for the Star Realm—who could have predicted they would meet such a fate?

Yang Kai felt a pang in his chest.

"Give up! You and one other possess Stellar Origins, so this Lord will not kill you, but the others..." Yin Lesheng said coldly. Throughout the battle, aside from being put to shame by Xiaoxiao once and looking a bit disheveled, he bore no wounds whatsoever.

"Feng De, spare the one with Stellar Origin; kill the rest!" Yin Lesheng suddenly ordered.

"Yes!" Feng De grinned viciously, his already ferocious blows growing even more savage, as if venting the humiliation he had suffered under Yin Lesheng to take revenge a hundredfold upon Ghost Ancestor and the others.

For a moment, Ghost Ancestor and the others' situation looked even more desperate.

Yang Kai drew in a deep breath, withdrew his gaze, and looked at Yin Lesheng. "You want my Stellar Origin? I can give it to you!"

"Oh? Finally surrendering?" Yin Lesheng's mouth curled with a sneer.

"But take this strike first!" Yang Kai's face suddenly twisted ferociously. He raised his hand and a pearl glowing faintly with purple light appeared in his palm—about the size of a pigeon egg, exquisitely beautiful, with faint lightning arcs flickering within.

"What is that..." Yin Lesheng frowned, a sense of unease arising as if that unassuming pearl could bring him great danger.

Before he could determine the grade of the Secret Treasure the pearl resembled, a chilling aura suddenly surged from within it, as if annihilating all things—a summons of death itself...

Yin Lesheng finally changed expression and cried out in horror, "You actually have a Dao Origin-grade Secret Treasure?!"

He had mistaken the Extinction Thunder Bead for a Dao Origin-grade Secret Treasure.

Yang Kai sneered, "Are you frightened?"

Yin Lesheng's face shifted wildly, but he calmed and said lightly, "Even if it is a Dao Origin-grade Secret Treasure, so what? It will have to break through this Lord's defenses first!"

With that, he charged straight at Yang Kai.

Though he did not truly believe the pearl in Yang Kai's hand could break the Netherworld Domain Veil, caution would not hurt, so he was not going to give Yang Kai a chance.

Yang Kai stood still and let him rush in, pouring his strength into the Extinction Thunder Bead like a flood released through a sluice.

As the power surged, the lightning arcs inside the bead seemed to be given life, leaping and wandering.

Whoosh...

A soft sound, and a faint purple light suddenly shot from the Extinction Thunder Bead.

That purple lightning arc flashed and vanished, appearing utterly harmless.

But that inconspicuous purple lightning arc pierced straight through the Netherworld Domain Veil surrounding Yin Lesheng's body; defenses that could withstand Yang Kai's full-strength attacks and even a direct clash with Xiaoxiao crumbled like foam before the purple arc.

Yin Lesheng's forward charge abruptly froze as if immobilized; his eyes trembled violently as he looked down in disbelief.

The next moment he saw a scene that chilled him—the Netherworld Domain Veil had been rent with a tiny hole!

Crack...

A crisp sound followed by a clattering noise.

The Netherworld Domain Veil shattered!

The Secret Treasure had reverted to its true form; its radiance waned, clearly having lost much of its spirit.

"An Imperial Treasure?" Yin Lesheng's face changed in horror as he stared at the Extinction Thunder Bead in Yang Kai's hand.

Only then did he realize he had underestimated Yang Kai's depth—Yang Kai's pearl was not merely a Dao Origin-grade Secret Treasure, it was plainly a higher-tier Imperial Treasure!
