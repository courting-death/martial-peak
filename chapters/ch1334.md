## Chapter 1334 — Qian Tong Trapped

“In truth, that old bastard Qian Tong isn't the sort to quarrel for the sake of fighting, but the Red Candle Fruit's flesh is too important; if he could really be elevated to the Void King Realm, then Yingyue Hall would become the foremost power on Dark Star, even Star Emperor Mountain couldn't stand beside us. Although the hope is slim, a hope is still a hope—Old Qian would think that, and Feng Zhen would naturally think so too. Once that happened, conflicts would erupt; Yingyue Hall is on the verge of a storm, chaos everywhere.” Fei Zhi Tu said with some anguish. “If this matter is mishandled, Yingyue Hall at best will suffer grievous wounds, at worst it could be destroyed outright!”

“That serious?” Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly.

“The elders and deacons of Qian Tong and Feng Zhen’s two factions have long held deep grudges against each other. Until now, it was only because the Hall Master himself kept them suppressed that no great turmoil broke out. But this time, even the Hall Master is powerless. In truth, were it not for the Hall Master’s advanced age, that Red Candle Fruit pulp would have been most suitable for him to consume. However, he could not bear to waste its medicinal potency, so he refrained from using it. If an internal war truly breaks out within our Yingyue Hall… heh heh, boy, when the nest is overturned, how could any egg remain unbroken?”

Yang Kai's eye twitched; he knew well what Fei Zhi Tu was implying. If Yingyue Hall truly tore itself apart, Dragon Lair Mountain would be the first to suffer, after all Dragon Lair Mountain still lies within Yingyue Hall's sphere of influence; when that time came, who could say what would happen.

But soon, Yang Kai’s expression turned indifferent again. Fixing his gaze on Fei Zhi Tu, he said, “Senior, there’s no need to make it sound so terrifying. This junior only wants to know one thing— which faction do you belong to?”

“Me?” Fei Zhi Tu raised an eyebrow, couldn't help laughing, and said slowly, “I grew tired of scheming with others, so I asked the Hall Master to station me out in Tianyun City as the lord of that city. Tell me, which faction would that make me?”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, a half-smile on his lips. “I heard much concern and care in your words for Elder Qian; I thought you might be on his side.”

“Bullshit! That old bastard Qian Tong—” Fei Zhi Tu snorted coldly; he seemed about to curse but stopped midway, waving a hand. “Forget it. In short, I owe Qian Tong a large favor from back then, so this time I mean to repay it.”

“What does that have to do with me?” Yang Kai frowned. “You summoned me here late at night—what for?”

Fei Zhi Tu stared at Yang Kai, his face grave. “Qian Tong is in trouble!”

Yang Kai's eyelids tightened.

“You don't strike me as ungrateful. Qian Tong did more than his share to keep Dragon Lair Mountain stable these years; don't think he hasn't looked after you. Had he not stood guard in Tianyun City, you would have been devoured down to the bones long ago—mere youngsters thinking to carve out kingdoms for themselves, pfft, ridiculous.”

“Let's set Dragon Lair Mountain aside for now. Lord Fei, tell me about Elder Qian's situation; if there's anything I can truly help with, I won't refuse.” Yang Kai said calmly. He already understood much without being told—Qian Tong's care had been a major reason Dragon Lair Mountain remained steady. Still, being spoken of that way by Fei Zhi Tu left him slightly displeased and his tone chilled.

Fei Zhi Tu didn't seem to mind. “What I'm about to tell you few know. It's grave—do not let it leak.”

After warning Yang Kai, he proceeded to tell the tale.

From Fei Zhi Tu's explanation, Yang Kai learned Qian Tong had been missing for nearly half a year; counting back, he disappeared around the time Yang Kai and Yang Yan set out for Liuli Sect.

Where he went was a matter of speculation—some said he closed himself within a life-and-death tribulation to comprehend a secret art; others said he went out seeking fortune and met misfortune; still others said he hid himself to prevent Yingyue Hall's collapse.

But none of those claims could be confirmed.

Now, with Yingyue Hall tottering and internal strife raging, his disappearance is baffling; without him at this critical moment, Feng Zhen's faction has grown bolder. Within Yingyue Hall a few elders can still stand against Feng Zhen, but lacking a key figure like Qian Tong, they're at a disadvantage.

If Qian Tong doesn't return soon, the consequences will be dire.

The recent joint attack by Ma Xinyuan and the Xie Family on Dragon Lair Mountain was Feng Zhen's final probe to see if Qian Tong truly hid himself; using the opportunity to strike Dragon Lair Mountain might force him to show himself. The probe cost one of the Xie Family's Origin Returning Realm cultivators his life, but should satisfy Feng Zhen's faction.

Qian Tong's total absence indicates something has indeed gone wrong—he's not merely hiding.

Once that news spreads back, Feng Zhen's faction will surely make a major move.

“Where is Elder Qian now?” Yang Kai asked, frowning.

“Inside an ancient ruin!” Fei Zhi Tu answered in a low voice.

“An ancient ruin!” Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

“Yes, though whether he's alive I can't say.” Fei Zhi Tu sighed slowly. “The last message I received from him was half a month ago—he used this thing to send word.”

Saying that, Fei Zhi Tu snapped his finger and a milky-white light spot popped from his fingertip and flew straight to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai reached out, catching the milky mote in his palm. He peered at it in wonder—this milky speck was actually a little creature like a snow-silkworm, only an inch long, pure white and plump, with faint tiny vessels visible inside.

However, when Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense over the body of that strange insect, a strand of spiritual intent suddenly transmitted from within it, shooting straight into Yang Kai’s mind.

Yang Kai's face tightened in surprise, then he quieted, listening intently.

The spiritual intent was indeed left by Qian Tong inside the creature, and through perception Yang Kai immediately understood Qian Tong's predicament.

Just as Fei Zhi Tu said, Qian Tong is trapped inside an ancient ruin and cannot escape. With no other means he sent his plea for help via this creature to Tianyun City, asking Fei Zhi Tu for aid.

“This creature is called a Whispering Insect. It is one of the ancient exotic species. It doesn’t have much use other than for transmitting messages, as it can ignore all barriers and restrictions, making it quite convenient to use. And don’t be fooled by its bloated appearance—when it moves, it’s astonishingly fast,” Fei Zhi Tu explained after Yang Kai finished his examination.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, a trace of gravity passing over his face as he returned the Whispering Insect to Fei Zhi Tu.

From Yang Kai's brief probing, Qian Tong's condition didn't look promising—the message left in the Whispering Insect seemed to be from after he'd been injured; after so long, no one knew what his true condition was.

“Lord Fei, if I may be so bold—why would Elder Qian, at such a critical moment, venture into an ancient ruin?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

Fei Zhi Tu snorted coldly. “How should I know his thoughts?”

He paused, then continued, “I suppose he didn't want Yingyue Hall's conflicts to truly break out, so he sought to rebalance the situation. You know he had a private friendship with Master Gelin and leveraged Master Gelin's prestige and connections to suppress Feng Zhen. But Master Gelin has passed, while the other side still has an Origin-Grade alchemist; the balance no longer exists. That ruin was discovered by Master Gelin, and Master Gelin became an Origin-Grade artificer thanks largely to that ruin. Qian Tong went to the ruin now to give someone a chance to break their bottleneck and reach Origin-Grade artificer level; once that person succeeds, Qian Tong would regain the initiative. Oh, I forgot to tell you—Qian Tong took someone with him, a Saint King-Grade artificer, considered Master Gelin's successor.”

“Elder Qian truly meant well.” Yang Kai couldn't help feeling some admiration.

“Meant well?” Fei Zhi Tu sneered, disdainful. “I think he's gone soft. With his means and connections, he could have dealt with Feng Zhen ruthlessly—even without Master Gelin—but instead he reaches far for that ruin. What's he thinking?”

Yang Kai chuckled. “Lord Fei seems to have a good relationship with Elder Qian.”

“Our relationship is none of your concern!” Fei Zhi Tu's face chilled. “I called you here because I want you to help pull Qian Tong out of that ancient ruin—lest he truly die in there.”

“What can I, a mere nobody, do to help? Explain plainly, Lord Fei. If that ruin can trap Qian Tong, then with my meager cultivation going in would be a suicide run.”

“You're cautious enough. Fine—I'll spell it out so you'll feel assured. I'm not counting on your raw strength; you're extraordinary but still only a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, managing to deal with so many Origin Returning Realm opponents largely thanks to outside forces—your success took aid from Secret Treasures and your Artifact Spirit. If you went in yourself you'd be a liability, but... your Artifact Spirit is good. I want to borrow its power.”

Yang Kai sneered, finally understanding why Fei Zhi Tu had summoned him at midnight—he wanted the Artifact Spirit.

“Inside that ruin is an ice passage of deadly peril. Your Artifact Spirit's flame isn't born of ordinary fire; even my Blue Jade Bowl cannot refine it. With it cutting the way, I can lead my people through the ice passage easily.”
