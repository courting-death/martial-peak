## Chapter 2579 — Banquet

"Ah!" Yang Kai was startled by what he heard. The consequences were more serious than he expected. He had only wanted to keep the little Wood Spirit from tiring herself out, never imagining it could lead to her being ostracized by her entire tribe. He quickly withdrew his outstretched hand, feeling awkward, and gave the little Wood Spirit an apologetic smile, speaking gently, "Then I'll trouble you."

Only then did the little Wood Spirit continue to hold the wine jar, filling the stone cup in front of him, then quietly flew to the side.

The Elder raised his cup and said loudly, "The bright moon hangs in the sky, honored guests are as precious as jade. On behalf of the Stone Spirit and Wood Spirit Races, I toast our guests. Please drink it all!"

A group of Stone Spirits all raised their stone cups, following the Elder's gesture toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai hurriedly rose to his feet, lifted his cup, and swept it in a circle to salute everyone. Tilting his head back, he drained the fine wine in one gulp, then turned the stone cup upside down to show he had finished it.

All the Stone Spirits also downed their wine in one gulp, each shaking their heads and showing an ecstatic expression. It seemed the wine tasted extraordinary to them.

"Please sit, guest!" After drinking, the Elder pressed his hand down toward Yang Kai, who then sat down again.

The taste of the wine in his belly was indeed excellent, lingering and endlessly enjoyable. Even someone who wasn't fond of drinking like him felt refreshed in body and mind. He wondered what kind of brewing skills the Wood Spirit Race possessed.

After the wine, Mu Na, the Wood Spirit Race leader who had been standing beside the Elder, suddenly clapped her hands lightly.

In an instant, more than twenty Wood Spirits flew to the center of the venue. Half of them held exquisite, delicate instruments in their hands. Without any conductor, flute sounds wailed, zither notes soared, and peculiar wooden drums thudded. It was like the tinkling of a mountain stream. The sounds were extremely pleasant. As each Wood Spirit played and sang, beautiful melodies echoed through the elegant forest.

The other half of the Wood Spirits stretched their waists and arms, singing and dancing in the center along with the music, full of exotic charm.

What they saw and heard seemed to have a magical power, cleansing the soul. Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi, the two foreign guests, felt their hearts calm, staring intently.

Especially Ruoxi, her eyes shone brightly, and the more she watched the Wood Spirits, the more she liked them.

The Stone Spirit Elder watched with a smile, stroking his stone beard and nodding gently at the wonderful parts.

The little Wood Spirit filled Yang Kai's cup again, but he didn't notice at all. He felt his whole body and mind drawn in by the music and dance, experiencing a peace he had never felt before, with all distracting thoughts vanishing.

Even after the dance ended, Yang Kai remained lost in thought for a long time.

It was the nearby commotion that finally woke him. He turned his head and couldn't help but twitch his mouth.

Over there, including Xiaoxiao, nine Stone Spirits were all burying their heads in a feast, looking like starving ghosts reincarnated. Each hugged their own wine jar, gulping down wine, with rare fine wine flowing from their mouths onto their chests, wasting countless drops. After a sip, they grabbed spirit fruits from the wooden basket in front of them and stuffed them into their mouths, chewing wildly...

The nine Wood Spirits serving wine nearby all looked at them with disgust.

The two tribes together were simply a combination of beauty and wildness, creating a strong visual contrast.

The Elder and Mu Na, the tribe leaders, were used to it, smiling silently as they watched.

Yang Kai simply buried his head and tasted the spirit fruits.

The spirit fruits grown by the Wood Spirit Race, and even their brewed spirit wine, were not only delicious but seemed to have a soul-cleansing effect. Yang Kai was amazed, secretly thinking that if someone suffering from Qi Deviation could get such things, it might help relieve their symptoms.

After three rounds of wine and five flavors of food, the atmosphere became lively.

Two Stone Spirits, swaying drunkenly, suddenly stood up from their seats. It wasn't clear which was which, as they looked almost identical, but they strode to the center of the venue.

The Wood Spirits playing music seemed to know what was about to happen, so they quickly flew aside, watching the two Stone Spirits with smiling faces.

Yang Kai and Ruoxi didn't know what those two were up to, so they watched curiously.

The two Stone Spirits in the center stared at each other for a while, then suddenly roared and charged at each other. With a loud bang, they collided like two mountains. One grabbed the other's neck, the other grabbed the other's waist. Both stood fixed in place, their feet constantly twisting under each other's legs, as if they had a deep grudge and wanted to destroy each other.

Yang Kai watched nervously, afraid they would get carried away and accidentally hurt the little Wood Spirits nearby. Yet the little Wood Spirits were also watching with great interest, shouting and cheering for the two Stone Spirits.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai finally understood—they were wrestling.

The Stone Spirit Race possessed immense strength. Such wild wrestling wasn't something just any race could play. Each clash made one's eyelids jump, but both tribes seemed used to it.

After a while, one Stone Spirit seized the opportunity, tripped the other with a foot, and used both hands to throw his opponent to the ground, raising a cloud of dust.

"Roar!" The victorious Stone Spirit howled at the sky, pounding his fists on his chest, looking extremely arrogant.

Immediately, another Stone Spirit couldn't stand it and jumped into the center to wrestle with him...

Stone Spirits were constantly eliminated, and new ones entered the fray. The atmosphere grew more intense, and even the Wood Spirits became so excited they flew to the center, shouting around the two Stone Spirits.

Yang Kai happily watched the excitement, his mood lifted, and he joined in the cheering.

But as he watched with growing excitement, he suddenly found himself caught up in the action.

All eight adult Stone Spirits had taken their turn. The final winner, seeing no more opponents, turned and beckoned to Yang Kai, as if inviting him to join the fight.

"Me?" Yang Kai pointed to his own nose and quickly waved his hand, "No, no, I'm just here to watch."

What a joke—wrestling with Stone Spirits was asking for trouble. He had experienced Xiaoxiao's strength before, and just in terms of brute force, ten of him couldn't match one Stone Spirit.

But the Stone Spirit wouldn't take no for an answer, insisting on him, beckoning repeatedly. Seeing his reluctance, the Stone Spirit waved his hand.

Suddenly, more than ten little Wood Spirits flew over, surrounded Yang Kai, and without a word, lifted him up and carried him to the center.

"You..." Yang Kai was helpless, feeling these little Wood Spirits were not so cute after all.

When they put him down in the center, the little Wood Spirits scattered, all watching him with lively expressions.

Yang Kai looked toward the Elder and the Wood Spirit Race leader, his face pleading for help.

The Elder laughed heartily, clearly not intending to rescue Yang Kai. Mu Na spoke gently, "Guest may use all your strength, no need to hold back."

With things said so plainly, Yang Kai could only resign himself.

He secretly thought that if he used the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, maybe he could compete with the Stone Spirit...

Before the thought was finished, the Stone Spirit roared and rushed at him, grabbing Yang Kai's arm and tripping him.

Yang Kai was stunned, feeling the world spin as he crashed heavily to the ground.

The Stone Spirit, having succeeded, raised his arms and howled, acting as if he was invincible and daring anyone to challenge him.

Yang Kai climbed up, covered his face, and retreated back to his seat in embarrassment.

It was too humiliating—he was no match at all! In terms of pure strength, there was probably no one in the world stronger than the Stone Spirits.

The little Wood Spirit serving wine looked at him sympathetically and quietly poured him another cup.

Seeing Yang Kai suffer such a loss, Xiaoxiao—who had not joined in until now—flew into a rage and dashed into the center of the arena, rolling up his sleeves as if to avenge Yang Kai’s humiliation. But despite his fierce spirit, Xiaoxiao was still the smallest among the Stone Spirits. Facing off against the adult Stone Spirit, he lasted only three breaths before being tossed out of the ring with a loud thud.

The banquet was lively, with the two tribes getting along harmoniously and joyfully.

After wrestling, the Stone Spirits started arm wrestling, all contests of strength.

Having suffered once, Yang Kai refused to compete with the Stone Spirits again, sitting quietly and watching.

In the latter half of the night, the Stone Spirits were still making a ruckus, as if they hadn't been so lively in ages. Judging by their attitude, they wouldn't stop until dawn. Many Wood Spirits, however, were exhausted, nodding off one by one.

The little Wood Spirit who had been by Yang Kai's side suddenly flew over, leaned close, and whispered something in his ear.

Yang Kai looked up and saw the Stone Spirit Elder and Wood Spirit Race leader had both stood up, heading toward a large tree nearby. Mu Na glanced back at him.

Yang Kai understood, quickly stood up, quietly sent a message to Zhang Ruoxi to stay put, and followed.

Under the tree, the Elder was gone, only Mu Na waiting. When she saw Yang Kai, she gestured, "Please."

Yang Kai didn't know what the two tribes wanted from him, but he didn't ask, following her into the treehouse.

This treehouse seemed larger and older than the others, with weathered walls all around. The Stone Spirit Elder stood facing a direction, quietly waiting.

Yang Kai looked around, then finally spoke, "I wonder what instructions the Elder has?"

The Elder turned, gestured for Yang Kai to sit and talk.

Once they were seated, the Elder said, "Guest, are you planning to take Shi Jiu away?"

Shi Jiu was Xiaoxiao's name among the Stone Spirit Race, because he was the smallest.

So that's what it was about. Yang Kai understood and smiled, "If he wants to leave and your tribe is willing to let him go, I can take him. To be honest, I came to the Wild Ancient Land this time to find him."

The Elder nodded gently, indicating he understood.

Yang Kai continued, "However, if he is willing to remain here, I will not force him. For him to find his own people and live among his kin is also something I would wish to see."
