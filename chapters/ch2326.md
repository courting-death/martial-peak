## Chapter 2326 — Secret Realm

"This is the Void Passage?" Ye Qinghan covered her red lips with her hand and exclaimed softly.

Although she had used Space Arrays to travel between places many times and knew that there were Void Passages connecting them, she had never seen one with her own eyes before.

It was her first time.

Ye Hen was also extremely shocked, but he stared unblinkingly at the Void Passage, as if trying to comprehend something from it.

Opportunities to witness a Void Passage were rare, especially ones opened by human hands that showed such clear traces. If he could gain any insight, it would be of immense benefit.

Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried, he could not grasp the traces of spatial power, and for a moment, he was filled with frustration.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai had already stood up and, with a flicker, darted into the Void Passage. As his figure disappeared, the rift of the Void Passage seemed to lose its supporting force and instantly closed up.

Both Ye Hen and his daughter looked worried, unsure if Yang Kai would succeed or become lost in the void, never to find his way back.

Inside the passage, Yang Kai walked forward at a leisurely pace.

The chaotic void currents surged around him, but a mysterious force from his body drew them aside, leaving him completely unharmed.

Yang Kai's mastery of spatial power was no longer what it had been in the past. The Spatial Law had already seeped into his very bones, so these mere void currents could not hinder him at all.

What troubled him now was how to find the exit to the secret realm.

Although the two Formation Foundations were connected, the one in the secret realm had been damaged for countless years. Yang Kai could only vaguely sense the connection from that side, but could not be completely certain.

In this Void Passage, he could only follow the faint direction of that connection and move forward quickly.

Fortunately, as time passed, that subtle connection became increasingly clear, allowing Yang Kai to confirm he was heading the right way.

He did not know how much time had passed when he suddenly stopped at a certain spot, released his Divine Sense to probe for a moment, and muttered, "It should be here."

As he spoke, he once again used his spatial force. Slowly extending both hands, he thrust them into the chaotic void currents ahead. Wherever his hands passed, ripples spread out, and the currents smoothed out like wrinkled paper being flattened.

As Yang Kai spread his hands, a ray of light suddenly appeared ahead.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, knowing his senses were correct, and increased his strength.

After a short while, Yang Kai tore open another rift in the passage. Through the crack, he vaguely saw a different scene and, overjoyed, leapt out without hesitation.

A slight feeling of weightlessness came over him, but Yang Kai quickly steadied himself. When his vision cleared, he found himself in a new world.

The Spiritual Qi here was astonishingly dense, no worse than his own Small Xuan Realm. The gathered Spiritual Qi was even beginning to form mist. It was a breathtaking sight. With such rich Spiritual Qi, the vegetation here flourished, and the grass was lush.

The place where he stood happened to be a Formation Foundation platform.

This Formation Foundation platform was exactly the same as the one Yang Kai had seen in the illusion array valley of Thousand Leaves Sect before. Clearly, both were made by the same person and were two parts of a connected whole.

However, perhaps because it had not been used for many years, the Formation Foundation platform was overgrown with grass and looked rather dilapidated.

Seeing this Formation Foundation platform, Yang Kai knew he had found the right place. This should be the secret realm of Thousand Leaves Sect—the very foundation of its former glory, and also the reason for its decline.

Yang Kai waved his hand, and a wave of scorching power swept out, instantly burning the grass to ash and revealing the intact platform beneath.

He swept his Divine Sense over it, wanting to know what was wrong with the Formation Foundation platform that caused the two places to be disconnected.

Soon, he discovered the problem and couldn't help but murmur softly.

Things were more or less as he had expected, but there were some differences.

The Formation Foundation platform here was indeed damaged, but not by natural causes—it was deliberately sabotaged.

Yang Kai found that the array diagrams carved on the Formation Foundation platform had a sword mark running through the entire platform. It was the destruction of these diagrams that caused the platform's defect and made it unusable.

How could this be? Yang Kai couldn't help but feel suspicious.

According to what Ye Qinghan had said, the reason Thousand Leaves Sect declined was because the entrance to the secret realm suddenly closed. If that were all, the sect would not have fallen so far. The key was that when the entrance closed, the Sect Master of that generation was still inside, bringing most of the sect's techniques and secret arts with him, causing the inheritance to be severed and the sect to gradually weaken.

Now, Thousand Leaves Sect could not even control those Earth-Grade puppets anymore. They could only let them be exposed to the elements in the plaza before the main hall.

He had thought all this was just a matter of fate and had lamented the bad luck of that generation's Sect Master, who happened to be inside when the entrance closed.

But the truth was very different from what he had guessed.

The Formation Foundation platform here had been deliberately destroyed. Judging by the force and smoothness of the sword mark, the person who did it was clearly in full control. He did not destroy everything, but simply cut a crack in the platform, severing the connection between the two Formation Foundations.

Combined with Ye Qinghan's account, the sword strike was undoubtedly made by the Sect Master at that time. He was not trapped here by accident, but chose to stay, even going so far as to damage the cross-realm Space Array to avoid being disturbed!

Why did he bring so many techniques and secret arts of Thousand Leaves Sect here? Was it to comprehend some secret art without interference? Yang Kai was completely puzzled.

If that was the case, it made sense! The sword mark on the Formation Foundation was not deep, just enough to block transmission between the two places. With the right materials and a bit more strength, it could be repaired.

That generation's Sect Master of Thousand Leaves Sect was at least an Emperor Realm expert, perhaps even at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. He would not have worried about being unable to repair the Formation Foundation after damaging it.

Still... what secret art did he want to cultivate that required coming to this place? Yang Kai thought for a long time but could not figure it out, and could only shake his head and sigh.

He did not rush to repair the crack in the Formation Foundation, but instead took out the map Ye Hen had given him earlier and glanced at it.

The map was not complicated, as the secret realm was not large—about the size of his Small Xuan Realm—but the Spiritual Qi here was outstanding, clearly due to the presence of an excellent Earth Vein.

If the two Formation Foundations could be repaired, Thousand Leaves Sect could be connected to this secret realm, and the Spiritual Qi here could be used by the sect. The disciples' cultivation environment would be greatly improved!

The map was clearly marked, and Yang Kai quickly found the location of Emperor Heaven Valley.

After a short while, he put away the map, summoned his wooden boat, and sped off in that direction.

Along the way, Yang Kai could not help but feel delighted, frequently stopping to fly down.

Because in this secret realm, there were many precious herbs.

Thousand Leaves Sect's secret realm had not been entered for tens of thousands of years, and with such dense Spiritual Qi, it was the perfect place for Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine to grow. Many precious herbs grew in large patches, their fragrance thick in the air. Yang Kai did not even need to search carefully—he could simply fly down and collect them.

Moreover, the herbs and medicines here were all of great age!

The herbs Yang Kai collected were at least several thousand years old, with some over ten thousand years. Each Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine was rich in medicinal power, making them the best materials for alchemy.

He gathered them with great enthusiasm!

Ye Hen probably never imagined there would be so many precious herbs in his own secret realm. If he had known, he would have insisted on coming in with Yang Kai and would never have let him have them all.

These herbs alone were enough to double Thousand Leaves Sect's wealth.

All the herbs ended up in Yang Kai's pouch.

And this was only the tip of the iceberg. If he explored the entire secret realm, Yang Kai reckoned he would never have to worry about alchemy materials again.

In just two days, the medicine garden in Yang Kai's Small Xuan Realm was packed full, and he had to move some of the less valuable herbs into his Spatial Ring.

Thousand Leaves Sect sat atop a treasure mountain but could not find the entrance. Otherwise, with these herbs alone, they would not have declined so much. Even if they could not rival the top sects of the Southern Territory, at least there would be many Emperor Realm experts in the sect, and they would not be bullied by second-rate forces.

The biggest problem for Thousand Leaves Sect now was the lack of an Emperor Realm expert, which was also the greatest difficulty faced by most second-rate forces in the Star Realm.

After all, there were not many Emperor Realm experts!

Another day passed, and a huge valley suddenly appeared ahead of Yang Kai. The scenery inside was beautiful, and a wonderful fragrance wafted out. Even before he got close, Yang Kai could smell the scent of many Spiritual Medicines. Comparing the shape of the valley to the map, Yang Kai was overjoyed, knowing he had found the place, and sped up.

Soon, Yang Kai landed in the center of Emperor Heaven Valley. After carefully sensing for a while, his expression became strange: "Tricked me? Where is the Emperor Intent?"

The reason he agreed to come to Thousand Leaves Sect and repair the cross-realm Space Array was because Emperor Heaven Valley attracted him.

He wanted to lay the foundation for his future advancement to Emperor.

After all, Ye Qinghan had said that Emperor Heaven Valley was filled with Imperial Might and Emperor Intent, making it the perfect place to comprehend the Martial Dao. It was the most important place in Thousand Leaves Sect's secret realm.

Yang Kai had planned to go into seclusion here to comprehend for a while, but when he arrived, he found that aside from the thick medicinal fragrance, there was no trace of Emperor Intent at all!
