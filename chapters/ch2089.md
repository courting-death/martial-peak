## Chapter 2089 — Request

Duan Yuanshan was dumbstruck by her words; he stared at Qin Yu and asked, "So you don't actually have the complete Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation?"

He couldn't help but look visibly disappointed — after all, without such an unparalleled formation, no one in the Dao Origin Realm would dare breach the Demonic Qi blockade, unless they were simply tired of living.

"I do have it, but it's not exactly the same as the original version," Qin Yu smiled.

"What do you mean?" Duan Yuanshan asked.

Qin Yu said, "An ancestor of my Qin Family was also an exceptional talent. Although he only mastered one-seventh of the formation originally, he practiced it with Senior Brothers and disciples of our Sect so often that he became familiar with the other parts as well. After the Black Tortoise Sect was destroyed, our ancestor fled to the Southern Territory and spent the rest of his life applying his skill and formation knowledge to complete the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation. He did say, however, that what he completed was an inferior copy and couldn't be compared to the original."

"What cultivation did your Qin Family ancestor reach?" Duan Yuanshan asked.

"Second Stage of the Emperor Realm!" Qin Yu said proudly.

Duan Yuanshan sucked in a cold breath.

Someone at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm was already a rare elite even within a great sect like the Black Tortoise Sect; such a person might even hold important posts, such as Deacon.

Yet even with the power of the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, it would be impossible to perfectly reproduce the original Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation — that alone showed how deep and formidable the formation had been.

"Though the formation isn't the original, I think it will be sufficient for dealing with the present situation. And... it's easier to employ; if we don't consider other factors, it's more than enough for defense."

Duan Yuanshan took a deep breath and said, "If we truly act on this, we must inform Brother Qin."

After all, Qin Chaoyang was the one who oversaw the Qin Family’s affairs; if they truly intended to deploy the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation, they would have to obtain his consent. This formation ought to be counted as the Qin Family’s greatest treasure.

Who would willingly expose such a formation to the public unless absolutely forced?

"Uncle Duan, rest assured — I've already sent word to the Patriarch; he should be here any moment!" Qin Yu said.

As she spoke, she seemed to sense something and turned to the side with a smile. "Here he comes."

In the distance, Qin Chaoyang flew over with a solemn face. He landed before Yang Kai and Duan Yuanshan and briefly cupped his fist.

Duan Yuanshan did not waste words and said directly, "Brother Qin, I won't elaborate the specifics — I imagine Yu'er has already told you everything. Now we need to use your Qin Family's Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation; what do you say?"

"This concerns the safety of Fenglin City; the Qin Family cannot stand aside. I agree to this matter," Qin Chaoyang said gravely.

"Ah?" Duan Yuanshan was stunned and looked astonished — he had not expected Qin Chaoyang to agree so readily, which rendered all of the persuasive arguments he'd prepared useless.

He had dealings with Qin Chaoyang before and knew that while the man wasn't petty or treacherous, he also wasn't easily moved, especially when the matter involved the Qin Family's greatest treasure.

He had thought Qin Chaoyang would stall or haggle.

After a moment, Duan Yuanshan gave a wry smile. "If Brother Qin has any demands, just state them. If they're not excessive, I, Duan, will agree."

Qin Chaoyang chuckled and said, "Why be so formal, Lord Duan? We're all trying to make a living in Fenglin City; if Fenglin City is in danger, the Qin Family surely will not shirk its duty..."

"Keep talking and you'll forfeit any reward."

"Since the City Lord is so earnest, I will reluctantly make a small request," Qin Chaoyang put on a face of helplessness, as if forced into doing something shameful; Duan Yuanshan watched and wished he could punch him until his face split.

"After this calamity, I will take over all of the Jiang Family's enterprises!" Qin Chaoyang said, his face turning serious.

Duan Yuanshan's eyes narrowed. "Brother Qin, aren't you afraid your appetite is too large and will ruin your stomach?"

In Fenglin City, aside from the City Lord mansion which symbolized the highest authority and dignity, the Jiang Family was the most powerful and largest clan among the families.

Now the Jiang Family had brought this on themselves — their top fighters had been annihilated and had all been turned into demonic men; their holdings and resources had become ownerless.

Fenglin City was besieged by Demonic Qi and monsters; the other family heads and ancestors were focused on jointly resisting the demonic calamity, not on seizing the Jiang Family's remnants. But once this was over, they would likely tear each other's throats out to snatch it.

Such a vast estate would rapidly boost whoever obtained it.

There were no eternal enemies or friends in the world, only eternal interests!

The City Lord mansion naturally also eyed the Jiang Family's remaining holdings with envy.

Yet Qin Chaoyang immediately sought to swallow it whole; even though Duan Yuanshan had braced himself for Qin Chaoyang to make a huge demand, this was hard to accept.

Not only was Duan Yuanshan unwilling, the other families in Fenglin City would never agree to such an outrageous request.

Qin Chaoyang laughed, "Why fear a big appetite? Isn't Lord Duan shielding the Qin Family for me?"

"You even scheme against my City Lord mansion?" Duan Yuanshan's expression grew indignant.

Qin Chaoyang chuckled, "Lord Duan, what are you saying? The Qin Family's fallen on hard times — we're simply borrowing the City Lord mansion's prestige to put on a bit of face. After all, if it weren't for you, Lord Duan, the Qin Family could never have swallowed up those holdings."

"You old lecher..." Duan Yuanshan burst into curses.

"How do you speak so? As the ruler of a city, have you no respect for the elders and love for the young?" Qin Chaoyang rolled his eyes and turned to Yang Kai, "Young Brother Yang, the City Lord just insulted me — I heard him clearly. I'm very angry; I'll lose ten years of life over this. I won't let him off!"

"You two can bicker — I'm leaving!" Yang Kai saw this and hurriedly tried to slip away.

He didn't want to be dragged into their quarrel; he was only a passerby in Fenglin City after all...

"Ha ha, just joking..." Qin Chaoyang grabbed Yang Kai's arm. "Young Brother Yang, don't be in such a hurry to leave. If we're really to form the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation, I will need your help!"

"Do I get a share too?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

Qin Chaoyang smiled, "Yu'er probably mentioned that the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation must be coordinated by seven people to manifest the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise's power. We have few Dao Origin Realm experts in Fenglin City; Young Brother naturally counts as one of them."

Yang Kai thought a moment and nodded, "Fine, count me in."

He was intensely curious about the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation; if he could learn such an unrivaled formation it would do him nothing but good.

Seeing Yang Kai agree, Qin Chaoyang's face brightened. He looked again at Duan Yuanshan and said, "Lord Duan, Qin has no objection; I only wonder what you decide."

Duan Yuanshan's expression turned grave. He said in a low voice, "Brother Qin, though my City Lord mansion is the foremost power in Fenglin City, you know those old men are not to be trifled with — doing something to anger the masses..."

"The City Lord mansion is supreme, with unmatched prowess and connections — are you afraid of those old men?" Qin Chaoyang smiled and shook his head. "I don't believe it!"

Duan Yuanshan's eyes narrowed and he barked, "Very well — as you say!"

"Splendid," Qin Chaoyang laughed heartily. "Then please arrange seven people. Yu'er and I will teach the array formation method for assembling the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Great Formation."

“In one hour, I will give you the names,” Duan Yuanshan said in a deep voice.

Qin Chaoyang nodded, shot Yang Kai a glance, and then flew off with Yang Kai and Qin Yu.

Not long after, the three returned to the defensive city wall that Qin Chaoyang had been responsible for.

At that spot, Qin Chaoyang suddenly grew serious and handed Yang Kai a jade slip. "Young Brother Yang, this contains the information—once you've studied it, destroy it immediately. If there is anything you do not understand, ask Yu'er. Though she is far below you in cultivation, in the art of formations she may be able to resolve some doubts."

Yang Kai's expression shifted as he accepted the jade slip. "Miss Qin's formation technique is indeed exquisite; I have already appreciated some of it."

He sank his Divine Sense into the jade slip and skimmed it. His expression changed slightly and, with surprise and doubt, he looked up at Qin Chaoyang. "Elder Qin, this is..."

The Black Tortoise Seven-Section Great Formation required seven people to cast it together. Back then, to prevent leakage of this secret, the Black Tortoise Sect taught each disciple only one portion — only the combined effort of seven could produce the complete great formation.

Yang Kai had assumed Qin Chaoyang's slip would likewise contain only one-seventh, but upon inspection he discovered it recorded the complete method to assemble the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation.

This was not the original formation, but the version their Qin Family ancestor had comprehended.

Even so, it remained a top-tier great formation.

Yang Kai could not fathom why Qin Chaoyang would do such a thing.

Qin Chaoyang smiled, "Young Brother Yang, don't overthink it. Fenglin City is in peril; if we cannot withstand this calamity, Fenglin City will be ruined and the Qin Family likely annihilated. Then the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Great Formation may be lost to time. By entrusting it to you, there is a chance to preserve a spark. After all, our ancestor spent his later life comprehending this; I cannot bear to let it be buried with the Qin Family."

"If the city truly cannot be defended, I might not be able to escape either," Yang Kai said softly.

"Young Brother, you are too modest," Qin Chaoyang said with deep meaning. "With your ability you should have left Fenglin City long ago. I do not know why you have stayed, but if you choose to remain and defend the city, you must have your reasons. I entrust this to you with only one request."

Yang Kai's expression moved. "What request?"

"If you ever leave Fenglin City, please take Yu'er with you and ensure her safety!" Qin Chaoyang said solemnly, earnestly pleading.
