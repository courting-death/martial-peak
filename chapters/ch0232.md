## Chapter 232 — It’s My Turn

The sword energy surged like a long rainbow piercing the sun, as Qi Jianxing's figure enveloped in sword light rushed towards Yang Kai. With a flick of his long sword, a curtain of sword energy descended upon Yang Kai, sealing off a space of over ten zhang around him.

The sound of clashing swords echoed incessantly, as if someone was lightly plucking a pipa in the void. The sharp sounds of the sword piercing through the air whistled, and visible strands of sword energy crisscrossed, wrapping Yang Kai tightly.

As the cold light flickered, Yang Kai's expression grew graver than ever. He fiercely urged his Yuan Qi, radiating an oppressive heat. With a sudden push of his palms, the Yuan Qi burst forth, forcefully pushing outward.

The two energies collided, producing a thunderous explosion in mid-air, instantly obliterating hundreds of sword lights.

Qi Jianxing's expression turned cold as he shouted, "You overestimate yourself!"

The long sword twirled, and the remaining sword energy gathered together, forming the shape of a long sword that slashed down at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed, and with a wide-open hand, he forced out a drop of Yang Liquid, which, guided by his will, transformed into a blood-red shield that blocked in front of him.

With a "bang," the sword energy struck the shield, causing ripples to spread across the blood-red surface, creating a crack without breaking it. Instead, Qi Jianxing's attack dissipated into nothingness.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai raised the blood-red shield in front of him, and with a swift sidestep, he lunged at Qi Jianxing. The latter let out a sharp cry and retreated rapidly, but Yang Kai pursued relentlessly. Both figures moved like lightning, one relying on exquisite footwork and the other on profound cultivation, rendering them evenly matched in speed.

Their figures intertwined as they unleashed fierce killing moves.

Qi Jianxing's expression flickered with surprise; he never expected that a martial artist from a second-rate sect, with only the cultivation of the Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, could unleash such power, leaving him momentarily unable to subdue him.

Feeling frustrated, he exerted even more effort, his long sword dancing in a manner that was impenetrable. The sword tip radiated a three-inch sword aura like a spirit snake emerging from its hole, constantly flickering. His moves shifted between real and fake, unpredictable and mysterious.

Surrounding trees fell in clusters, and wherever they passed, dust and stones flew. The battle was intense.

In just ten breaths, they exchanged thirty moves, neither able to gain the upper hand. However, Qi Jianxing clearly held the absolute advantage, with eight out of ten moves being offensive.

With a cold laugh, Qi Jianxing unleashed a flurry of sword flowers, and one sword point struck Yang Kai's blood-red shield.

With a crisp crack, the blood-red shield formed from Yang Liquid finally could not withstand the high-intensity attack and shattered with a loud bang.

Yang Kai's expression changed drastically as he desperately tried to escape Qi Jianxing's attack range, but the latter would not give him that opportunity.

The long sword, seemingly possessing sentience, wrapped around one of Yang Kai's arms after shattering the shield.

"Swish, swish, swish..." His clothes were torn to shreds, fabric flying everywhere.

Yang Kai roared in anger, and his Yuan Qi surged forth, using it as a defense to charge forward instead of retreating. A fierce punch erupted, flames igniting fiercely on his fist, distorting the air around it.

Noticing the terrifying killing intent contained in this punch, Qi Jianxing's expression turned pale. He thrust his long sword into Yang Kai's shoulder, piercing three inches deep, using the rebound force to retreat swiftly.

Yet he was still a moment too late; Yang Kai's Triple Flame Yang Explosion had already erupted.

With a series of rapid steps, Qi Jianxing retreated over a dozen paces, dissipating the force of the punch while simultaneously mobilizing his True Essence to neutralize the scorching Yuan Qi invading his body.

After a moment, Qi Jianxing's face turned pale, and he took a deep breath.

The unstoppable Triple Flame Yang Explosion had been completely neutralized, not injuring him in the slightest.

In contrast, Yang Kai's right arm was already shredded by the long sword, and countless fine blood lines covered his exposed arm, instantly dyeing it red, looking extremely horrifying.

At the same time Qi Jianxing neutralized the force of the Triple Flame Yang Explosion, Yang Kai also let out a light pant, shaking his arm to refine the sword energy that had invaded his body into nothingness.

"Hehe..." Qi Jianxing's gaze was cold and sinister as he stared intently at Yang Kai. "A mere Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union Realm can possess such strength! Impressive, impressive!"

As he spoke, he pointed his long sword from afar, "You are the most formidable martial artist of the Separation and Union Realm I have ever seen. Your Yuan Qi purity is no less than that of an average True Essence Realm martial artist, perhaps even surpassing mine! However... a poor background is still a poor background. The sword techniques of my Jiu Xing Sword Sect are immensely powerful; how could someone like you hope to break them?"

With an arrogant expression and a cold voice, Qi Jianxing solemnly declared, "Just now, I only used seventy percent of my strength. If I unleash my full power, how long can you withstand it?"

Holding the sword with both hands, raised before his chest, Qi Jianxing's expression turned serious as his True Essence erupted. He shouted, "Sword Body!"

A clear sword cry resounded as the long sword in his hand trembled incessantly.

A sharp aura erupted from him, and transformed into an unparalleled long sword. His external True Essence surged, and in an instant, his aura reached its peak. His long hair floated without wind, and countless small swords swirled around him.

Looking around, it was as if he was guarded by a myriad of swords.

The sword techniques of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect were indeed profound.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, his expression turning extremely serious.

Qi Jianxing was evidently angered by the punch he received earlier, prompting him to unleash this so-called "Sword Body" martial skill. With the myriad swords formed from True Essence guarding him, Qi Jianxing now resembled a hedgehog. If Yang Kai attempted to strike him with his fists, he would inevitably injure himself first.

"To force me to use Sword Body, you can be proud!" Qi Jianxing coldly gazed at Yang Kai, his expression filled with disdain and superiority, as he casually walked towards him.

Yang Kai did not dare to be negligent and quickly activated his Unyielding Will.

The aura of the Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union Realm instantly surged to the peak of the Separation and Union Realm.

When he was at the First Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, Yang Kai could use Unyielding Will to temporarily possess peak strength. Now, at the Seventh Stage, he could still do the same.

This demonstrated that the True Essence Realm was a significant watershed for martial artists; the transformation of Yuan Qi into True Essence within one's body was not a simple matter of improvement.

Noticing Yang Kai's rising aura, Qi Jianxing's expression froze for a moment before he smiled slightly, saying dismissively, "Not bad, so you weren't using your full strength earlier. But now, you are merely at the peak of the Separation and Union Realm; you are still not my opponent..."

"Whether I am your opponent or not, we will know after a fight." Yang Kai chuckled coldly, producing another blood-red shield.

Qi Jianxing's expression turned cold. He had already suffered from this shield once, unable to break it despite attacking for a long time. Now seeing Yang Kai easily condense another one, he was naturally furious and shouted, "Watch me break your trash shield and teach you a lesson!"

With quickened steps, he charged forward, sweeping his long sword. The True Essence sword energy outside his body surged forth like an extension of his will, shooting out several fierce attacks towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai dodged to the side, but those True Essence sword energies were different from before; they could actually curve and chase after him according to Qi Jianxing's will.

After hurriedly dodging three or four times, Qi Jianxing was already upon him, unleashing a powerful sword technique with a sinister laugh, fiercely cleaving down at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised his shield to block, and with a loud bang, the shield shook violently, nearly unsteady. Qi Jianxing laughed heartily, launching one attack after another, combining them with the unpredictable True Essence sword energy, forcing Yang Kai to retreat in a desperate scramble, crying out in distress.

During the battle, both their Yuan Qi rapidly depleted.

Such a high-intensity life-and-death struggle placed a considerable burden on any martial artist's body. While physical stamina was secondary, the use of Yuan Qi was the most critical issue.

A powerful and battle-hardened martial artist would meticulously calculate every bit of Yuan Qi they used, achieving maximum lethality with minimal expenditure.

At this moment, neither Yang Kai nor Qi Jianxing could do that; their realms had not reached that level. They could only recklessly expend their Yuan Qi to maintain their moves and momentum.

In just half a stick of incense, Yang Kai had not launched a single attack. He had been on the defensive the entire time, while Qi Jianxing was in high spirits, continuously mocking and ridiculing him, as if he had already secured victory over Yang Kai.

While dodging, Yang Kai appeared somewhat exhausted, stumbling slightly as if about to fall.

Seeing this opportunity, Qi Jianxing would not let it slip by. He horizontally cut out with his long sword, aiming directly for Yang Kai's neck.

Yang Kai hurriedly raised his shield to block, but Qi Jianxing had long been prepared. Midway through his strike, he flicked his sword, changing the sweep into a thrust. Yang Kai's shield quickly adapted, plunging downwards.

Qi Jianxing sneered continuously, but a glimmer of calmness flashed in Yang Kai's eyes.

Just as the shield was about to strike the long sword, the blood-red shield suddenly transformed and shrank, swiftly morphing into the shape of a dagger.

Qi Jianxing's expression shifted to one of shock and disbelief as he watched the blood-red dagger slice through his long sword.

With a crack, the long sword snapped cleanly in two!

Back when he was in the Open Origin Realm, Yang Kai could use weapons formed from Yang Liquid to destroy a Common-Grade defensive treasure. Now, having reached the Separation and Union Realm, with his Yuan Qi even more refined and concentrated, Qi Jianxing's long sword, merely a finely forged steel weapon and not even a treasure, could not withstand such a strike.

Yang Kai had waited for this opportunity for a long time, and the dagger danced like a flower in bloom.

With a series of light sounds, Qi Jianxing's long sword shattered into several pieces. Had he not retreated quickly, he would have even lost his hand that held the sword.

"You..." Qi Jianxing's eyes trembled as he stared in shock at Yang Kai. He had previously wielded his sword with great agility and had no need to clash directly with Yang Kai, so he never worried about damaging his weapon. But he never expected that the shield meant for defense could also transform.

In an instant of carelessness, his weapon was destroyed!

Without his long sword, the strength of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect disciple was bound to be greatly reduced.

"Now it’s my turn!" Yang Kai took a deep breath, completely changing from his earlier disheveled and weak appearance. His eyes shone with brilliance, filled with boundless fighting spirit as he looked down upon Qi Jianxing.

The latter suddenly realized that the earlier performance had merely been an act, including the shield he had shattered before, all part of Yang Kai's deliberate ploy to lower his guard, biding his time to destroy his long sword.

What a deep scheme, what a sharp tactic! For the first time, Qi Jianxing regarded Yang Kai seriously.

Yet he remained unafraid, discarding the sword hilt in his hand, and arrogantly declared, "Even without a weapon, so what? You are still not my opponent!"
