## Chapter 1625 — Chi Lan Star, Icebound Island

Yang Kai's arrival this time still stirred no one; across the entire Small Xuan Realm, ninety-nine percent of the martial artists were in seclusion training.

In the pavilion pavilion, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, having swallowed a number of restorative pills before beginning to stir his Saint Yuan to purge the qi strands embedded in his body.

Those tiny threads of qi carried within them the killing intent of a Void King Realm expert—an aura of slaughter; were it not for Yang Kai's iron body, those very intents alone would have shredded him to pieces.

The methods of a Second Stage Void King Realm expert cannot be gauged by ordinary reasoning.

Yang Kai stirred his Saint Yuan, letting it weave through his meridians and flesh to surround and dissolve those fine qi strands.

But very quickly his expression changed; it grew extremely ugly.

His Saint Yuan, dense and refined enough to look down upon all others at the Origin Returning Realm, proved utterly helpless against those streams of force. No matter how vast and mighty his Saint Yuan surged to envelop them, it was torn apart as if fragile paper — ripped open and scattered, collapsing without resistance.

He did not lose heart and tried again and again to stir his Saint Yuan, hoping to grind them down little by little.

Ten days passed in a flash.

In the pavilion, Yang Kai's aura had not recovered much; if anything, it had grown a touch more feeble.

After ten days of effort with no result, not only had Luo Hai's qi strands not been cleansed, Yang Kai's Saint Yuan had been reduced by countless amounts.

There was a full great realm's difference; his Saint Yuan was simply no match for that qi.

Yang Kai opened his eyes and ceased the futility; although his expression was listless, his gaze remained bright.

Qi strands are dead; the man is alive. He was certain he could dissolve them—he had only not found the right method yet.

If Saint Yuan could not defeat them, what about the other things? The power hidden in Yang Kai's body was not limited to Saint Yuan alone.

There was also Spatial Force, and the Undying Five Elements Sword qi...

Thinking so, Yang Kai began to experiment.

He condensed a strand of Spatial Force and wrapped it around one of the tiny qi threads; as if sensing something, when the Spatial Force enveloped it the qi immediately counterattacked, a razor-sharp profound intent lashing into the Spatial Force. Though it affected the Spatial Force somewhat, it did not collapse like the Saint Yuan had.

"This might work!" Yang Kai's eyes brightened. He controlled the spatial energy with greater caution.

After a moment, the Spatial Force had enclosed that tiny qi strand, and no matter how it thrashed inside, it could not break free.

In the next instant Yang Kai's Divine Sense flickered; the Spatial Force containing the qi pierced through the spatial barrier and was drawn outside his body.

The Spatial Force dissipated and that invisible qi splashed into the void, shooting toward a spot and gouging a pinhole-sized perforation in the pavilion before being extinguished.

Seeing this, Yang Kai breathed a quiet sigh of relief—Spatial Force could drive the qi from his body. But doing so was cumbersome and inefficient.

During the flight from death, Luo Hai's attack had splintered into over ten thousand qi strands inside Yang Kai; using that method to expel them would take no less than three to five years.

That was far too long!

Yang Kai frowned and began to attempt using the Undying Five Elements Sword qi.

The Undying Five Elements Sword was a body-tempering cultivation art. During cultivation, it would generate the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi within the practitioner’s body — each strand embodying one of the five elements, each with its own effect. Metal and fire governed slaughter, wood governed life, while earth and water governed defense. The five elements restrained and reinforced one another. When cultivated to its limit, it could allow a cultivator to attain the Undying body.

Yang Kai’s Undying Five Elements Sword could barely be considered to have reached minor accomplishment — useful in combat, but the legendary Undying Body remained far off.

Now, he summoned the Undying Five Elements Sword qi within him, extracting the metal and fire strands of sword qi that were primarily for killing, and began to dissolve Luo Hai's qi strands.

Within his flesh, golden and crimson lights bloomed, weaving through Yang Kai's wounds to assault the qi threads.

Although Luo Hai’s qi was no longer under anyone’s control, it refused to sit still and be destroyed. Facing the interception of the two strands of sword qi, it began to fight back.

It was in vain—within only three breaths the golden and fire sword qi had ground that strand of qi to nothing!

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, his face breaking into a look of great joy.

He had not expected the Undying Five Elements Sword to be so effective against Luo Hai's qi; in contrast, Spatial Force seemed somewhat eclipsed.

That could be understood: Spatial Force is vast and deep, but Luo Hai's qi appeared to have been derived from sword qi; the Undying Five Elements Sword qi was also sword qi and thus could counter it.

Seeing hope, Yang Kai spared no effort in stirring his Undying Five Elements Sword qi; not only did he use metal and fire, the remaining water, earth, and wood surged forth as well, and the efficiency immediately improved considerably.

He did not waste time; he took out the Five Elements treasures and sketched an array around himself in proper order—driving out Luo Hai's qi while cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword.

Time passed, and three months slipped by.

At last, the qi inside Yang Kai was completely expelled, and for some reason he felt his Undying Five Elements Sword qi had greatly increased in power.

He guessed it had something to do with absorbing Luo Hai's sword qi profound intents while dissolving them.

The Five Elements treasures were the Sun's True Essence, Profound Yin Moon Water, Dayan Divine Sand, Xuan Gold, and Thundertree.

The Sun's True Essence needed no worry—it was the star core of a sun-star and had barely changed under Yang Kai's cultivation; the Profound Yin Moon Water had only half left, the Dayan Divine Sand similarly, Xuan Gold was now only the size of an infant's palm, and the Thundertree seemed unlikely to last much longer.

Cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword consumed the Five Elements treasures too severely.

Ordinary people really could not afford to cultivate it.

It seemed that aside from the Sun's True Essence, the other four items would need substitutes; otherwise, once those materials were used up he would not be able to continue.

With that thought, Yang Kai did not cease training.

He also examined his body.

Luo Hai's qi had been entirely expelled and his wounds had all healed; moreover, because he had escaped death at Luo Hai's hands, Yang Kai faintly felt his cultivation had made considerable progress.

He seemed close to breaking through to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

After all, Yang Kai had gained immense benefits in the Blood Prison before; it was only because his recent advancement hadn’t been long ago that he couldn’t break through again so soon. Had he reached the Second Stage a few years earlier, he believed he could have advanced to the Third Stage right there within the Blood Prison.

There was no rush; in any case he would reach that step eventually.

His Divine Sense swept outward—Xia Ningshang was refining pills, her eyes resolute and still streaked with blood; it seemed she had not rested for some time.

Yang Kai sighed softly and transmitted voice to tell her he had fully recovered; only then did his Little Senior Sister smile.

Yang Kai did not hastily emerge from seclusion, but remained in the pavilion.

During the chase by Luo Hai he had repeatedly used Spatial Force to flee, which had given him great insight, deepening his comprehension of Spatial Force.

At the time things had been too urgent for him to refine that understanding.

Now that the crisis was over, he would not miss the opportunity—he stayed in the pavilion cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword while pondering Spatial Force.

…

Icebound Island is a renowned presence on Chi Lan Star.

Its fame stemmed from the fact that one of Chi Lan Star's two most powerful sects, Ice Heart Valley, had its main headquarters on this island.

Icebound Island was surrounded on all sides by sea, its surface sealed beneath dozens of zhang of solid ice. The temperature there was bitterly low. The disciples of Ice Heart Valley cultivated ice-attribute arts and Martial Skills, and even their Secret Treasures were all of the ice element.

Ice Heart Valley could become one of Chi Lan Star's two greatest sects because a Void King Realm Grand Elder sat in its halls!

Beyond that, from the valley lord down to the elders, the sect's powerhouses were all at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, poised to breach the Void King Realm with but one more step.

Ice Heart Valley alone had over a hundred Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts.

Such numbers were terrifying; no force on Dark Star could compare. Once the mightiest Star Emperor Mountain had only thirty Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators, and they had all since become people of the Lingxiao Sect.

Matching Ice Heart Valley in renown was the equally famed Fire Radiance Sect.

For over ten thousand years, these two great sects had held the throne as the strongest powers on Chi Lan Star. Whether due to differing cultivation philosophies or the simple truth that one mountain cannot hold two tigers, grudges had long festered between them. When their disciples met outside while tempering themselves, it almost always ended in a fight to the death.

Their grievances ran deep — ten thousand years of resentment, with no hope of reconciliation.

At this moment, at the heart of Icebound Island within an ice palace, a dozen or so women of varied beauty and age sat in two rows.

At the forefront stood a beautiful woman in palace robes. Her features might not be enough to topple cities, yet her eyes were stunning—like stars in the heavens—so captivating that one could hardly bear to look away.

The valley lord of Ice Heart Valley was Bing Long—an expert at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—her power nearly complete, the strongest under the Grand Elder of Ice Heart Valley.

Ice Heart Valley's disciples were all female; there had never been precedent for male disciples entering the sect.

Yet no one dared belittle them for being women—any who did were already dead.

The atmosphere inside the ice palace was somewhat grave; many of Ice Heart Valley's upper ranks seemed to be discussing a major matter.

"Valley Lord, the Fire Radiance Sect's recent movements are odd—their pressure against Ice Heart Valley has weakened, and many disciples have been mobilized frequently; it seems they are searching for someone," the woman seated first on the left said. She appeared about thirty, dressed as a young married woman, her figure graceful but her expression icy cold.

That speaker was Ice Heart Valley's Great Elder, Ran Yunting, whose cultivation matched Valley Lord Bing Long's though her strength was slightly inferior, hence her position as Great Elder.

"Searching for someone? For what matter?" Bing Long raised her brows; her voice was soft but carried weight. "Have the disciples uncovered any definite intelligence?"

Ran Yunting shook her head. "The lower disciples of the Fire Radiance Sect are not quite clear; they only know the Fire Radiance Sect seeks a young man. Ah—here is his portrait; please view it, Valley Lord!"
