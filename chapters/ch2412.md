## Chapter 2412 — Zi Yu

But on second thought, that didn’t seem likely. Ice Heart Valley was such a large Sect, with over ten thousand disciples. There was no way someone could secretly keep a man here without being discovered. Besides, Ice Heart Valley didn’t forbid marriage. If a disciple and a man truly fell in love, they could marry, but after marrying, they would no longer be considered part of Ice Heart Valley.

When it came to matters between men and women, Bing Yun had never set overly strict rules. She knew that everyone had emotions and desires, and it was perfectly normal for disciples to meet men they liked while traveling outside. This rule was already quite open-minded.

Still, running into a man here was enough to surprise Yang Kai, because unless someone had a special status, it was impossible for a man to live inside Ice Heart Valley.

With his curiosity piqued, he wanted to secretly investigate what those two men were doing here. But when one of them unintentionally released a trace of power, Yang Kai immediately dared not act rashly.

Because that man was actually a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert!

He had fought and even killed a few First Stage Emperor Realm experts, but he had never faced someone at the Second Stage. He had no idea just how powerful such an expert might be.

He had another mission to accomplish on this trip, so he couldn’t afford any complications right now.

So after a brief moment of hesitation, Yang Kai quickly slipped away into the distance.

“Who’s there!” a loud shout erupted from the building, and a figure shot out in an instant.

Yang Kai was startled, realizing he had underestimated the vigilance of a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert. He had only passed by, yet he was still discovered.

At this critical moment, he didn’t dare hesitate. He immediately teleported, vanishing from the spot.

The next moment, a heroic figure appeared at the spot where he had just been hiding. With a gloomy expression, he released his Divine Sense to search the area, but found nothing.

Another young man soon followed, standing beside the middle-aged man and frowning, “Senior Uncle Yao, what’s wrong?”

The middle-aged man said, “Someone was just here!”

The young man asked in surprise, “Who?”

The man shook his head, “I’m not sure, but this person left very quickly. Also, there’s a faint residual fluctuation of spatial power here.”

“Spatial Force?” The young man was shocked and blurted, “Senior Uncle, are you saying someone in Ice Heart Valley is proficient in Spatial Force?”

The middle-aged man pondered for a moment, then slowly shook his head, “As far as I know, no one in Ice Heart Valley is proficient in this strange power. The spatial fluctuations here might be because someone set up a teleportation array in advance.”

Hearing this explanation, the young man relaxed a lot and smiled, “I thought there was some genius in Ice Heart Valley who actually cultivated spatial power. So it’s just a teleportation array. I wonder who’s so bored to do such a thing.”

The middle-aged man said, “Xi’er, you should know that many in Ice Heart Valley oppose this marriage, especially the former Sect Master. This matter might have been arranged by her.”

The young man smiled faintly, “So what if it was her? In two days, it’ll be the wedding day. By then, I’ll take Zi Yu back to the Sect, and from then on, she’ll have nothing more to do with Ice Heart Valley.”

The middle-aged man nodded, “That Zi Yu is the top of the younger generation in Ice Heart Valley, and she’s famous throughout the Northern Territory. Whether in cultivation or talent, she’s not inferior to you at all. She’s a good match for you.”

Hearing the name Zi Yu, a look of deep affection appeared on the young man’s face. He said softly, “Of course. If not, how could Xi’er have fallen for her?”

The middle-aged man frowned at the young man and reminded him, “Our Wenqing Sect’s Supreme Sentiment Art requires using emotion to enter the Dao. The deeper the feeling, the faster the cultivation. But Xi’er, you should know, if the other party doesn’t truly fall for you, when your cultivation is complete, you’ll suffer a huge backlash. Are you confident you can win her over? Make her love you wholeheartedly? Your father nearly perished because of this back then. Fortunately, your mother moved him with her feelings at the last moment. Your Senior Uncle doesn’t want anything to happen to you. You carry the future of our Wenqing Sect.”

The young man replied confidently, “Don’t worry, Senior Uncle. As long as Zi Yu comes back to the Sect with me, I’ll definitely conquer her body and heart. When it comes to the ways of men and women, Xi’er has truly inherited his father’s teachings!”

“It’s good that you have this confidence. Go back and rest. In two days, it’ll be an auspicious day. The Sect Master will also come. You need to be in top form!”

The young man was surprised, “Father will come in person? Isn’t that giving Ice Heart Valley too much face?”

The middle-aged man smiled, “Although Ice Heart Valley’s reputation isn’t what it used to be, it was once one of the top Sects in the Northern Territory. When their founder was still around, they were always on par with our Wenqing Sect. Giving them some face is no big deal. Besides, this is your wedding. How could the Sect Master miss it?”

“That’s great!” the young man said in delight.

…

Yang Kai moved through Ice Heart Valley's restrictions and arrays, holding the token Bing Yun had given him, so he wasn’t worried about triggering anything.

He went deeper and deeper, avoiding all potential dangers. About an hour later, he suddenly arrived at an extremely frigid place.

The entire Ice Heart Valley was bone-chillingly cold, since the disciples cultivated ice-based techniques and secret arts. Training in such an environment was twice as effective for them.

But this place was even colder. Even someone as strong as Yang Kai had to circulate his Origin Qi to feel a bit more comfortable.

Once inside, Yang Kai could no longer sense any living aura.

This must be the forbidden area of Ice Heart Valley!

Every Sect has its own forbidden areas. Many are places where ancestral tablets are placed, while others are for cultivation, accessible only to a select few within the Sect.

For Ice Heart Valley, this forbidden area was both a place for outstanding disciples to cultivate and a place for confinement.

If a disciple committed a mistake, she might be imprisoned here. The cold here was so intense that even Ice Heart Valley disciples couldn’t endure it for long.

Ahead was a corridor covered in ice. Yang Kai, holding the token, broke through the restrictions as he went deeper. The further he went, the clearer the surrounding laws of cold became.

Yang Kai was secretly shocked, realizing how important this place must be to Ice Heart Valley. If a disciple could cultivate here, her strength would surely soar—of course, only if she could withstand the profound intent of the cold. Otherwise, she’d be frozen into an ice sculpture.

On either side of the icy corridor stood walls as white and smooth as mirrors. Upon these walls, countless lifelike figures were intricately carved. As Yang Kai gazed at them, he was startled to find that, right before his eyes, the images seemed to come alive—each figure graceful and elegant, their movements flowing like water, as if demonstrating some profound and powerful secret arts.

He couldn’t help but feel a bit dazzled.

Unfortunately, he didn’t cultivate ice-based techniques, so even with such an opportunity before him, it didn’t mean much to him.

He couldn’t glean any mysteries from these images—he just found them strangely fascinating.

He sighed softly, knowing this wasn’t his chance. Without further hesitation, he headed straight for the end of the icy corridor.

Soon, he reached the end, and his vision suddenly opened up. Ahead was an ice lake radiating bone-chilling cold. The ground was frozen solid, and the omnipresent laws of cold seemed able to freeze even one’s Divine Soul.

Yang Kai shivered involuntarily and circulated a bit more Origin Qi to resist the pervasive cold.

Because of the cold, the entire forbidden area was filled with white mist, making it impossible to see what was inside.

Still, Yang Kai could vaguely make out a small island in the middle of the ice lake, and on that island, a figure was sitting cross-legged.

Was this the Ice Heart Valley disciple who had summoned Bing Yun through a secret art? The thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind. He quietly released his Divine Sense to investigate and found that the woman’s cultivation was the same as his—Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

But what puzzled him was that, for some reason, he found this woman’s aura somewhat familiar, as if he had seen her somewhere before.

Just as Yang Kai was feeling suspicious, a buzzing sound suddenly came from the island.

Yang Kai’s heart leapt. Somehow, he felt that something was calling out to him, and that something was on the small island in the center of the ice lake.

This discovery left him confused. He had no idea what could be calling him.

“Master?” Suddenly, a melodious voice came from the island, trembling as it called in Yang Kai’s direction, “Master, is that you? Have you come to see Yu’er?”

Judging by her tone, she had mistaken him for someone else!

But after hearing this voice, Yang Kai suddenly understood why the woman’s aura felt familiar. He also realized who she was. He had seen her just a few days ago. Although they hadn’t interacted much, Yang Kai still remembered her aura and voice.

He coughed lightly, trying to make his voice sound as polite as possible so as not to startle her, and said, “Miss Zi Yu?”

As expected, the woman on the island was startled and shouted, “Who are you? How did you get here?”

This was the forbidden area of Ice Heart Valley. Without permission from the Sect’s upper echelons, even she couldn’t enter. Yet a man had suddenly appeared here—how could she not be shocked?

A flash of realization crossed her mind, and Zi Yu snorted coldly, “You’re from Wenqing Sect, aren’t you? Did Feng Xi send you?”

Her tone was full of hostility and rejection. Who knew what that Feng Xi fellow had done to offend her?

Yang Kai stood where he was and said, “Miss Zi Yu, you misunderstand. I don’t know any Feng Xi, and I’m not from Wenqing Sect. I came here because of the summoning message you sent.”

“Summoning message?” Zi Yu was stunned, then cried out, “How do you know about that? That was a message I sent to summon the founder of my Sect!”
