## Chapter 2410 — Zi Yu

Cao Yang forced himself to stand, his face full of dread and disbelief as he looked toward Yang Kai. By now, he understood that Dong Shan’s injury wasn’t because Yang Kai had ambushed him; even in a fair fight, Dong Shan was absolutely no match for this young man.

When did such a monstrous youth appear in the Northern Territory? Which Sect was he from? They were both at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet he himself couldn’t withstand even a single move from the other. If someone like this reached the Emperor Realm, just how terrifying would his strength be?

The names and faces of all the rising stars from the major Sects flashed through his mind, but none matched Yang Kai.

"Friend, where are you from? Give me your name. One day, my Wenqing Sect will surely pay you a visit!" Realizing he was no match for Yang Kai, Cao Yang could only bring up his Sect, hoping Yang Kai would hesitate and not develop any murderous intent, so his group might escape alive.

Fan Xin let out a cold snort and said, “Weren’t you all so bold just now, ganging up on one person? A bunch of grown men bullying a lone woman—Wenqing Sect is truly impressive!”

Her barbed mockery left the Wenqing Sect group unable to save face, each of them looking embarrassed. But now that they were outmatched and their two strongest fighters were gravely injured, they had no grounds to act tough. Their faces burned as if on fire, and their hearts were full of resentment.

"There's no harm in telling you, we are…" Fan Xin began, but Yang Kai waved his hand to cut her off.

He still stood on the deck, never having moved an inch, and looked down as he said calmly, “We’re just passing travelers.”

“Just passing by!” Cao Yang bit down on his bloodied teeth, knowing Yang Kai had no intention of revealing his origins. Outmatched, he couldn’t force the issue, so he glared fiercely at Yang Kai, as if to memorize his face. He cupped his fists and said in a deep voice, “Friend, your skills are impressive. I, Cao, have learned my lesson. Since you’ve stepped in today, we’ll take our leave. I hope you all take care!”

With those parting words, he waved his hand and quickly led the Wenqing Sect group away.

Fan Xin bit her silver teeth, her face full of indignation, but seeing that Yang Kai had no intention of eradicating them, she said nothing more.

After that group left, Yang Kai said calmly, “Wenqing Sect is a top Sect in the Northern Territory. With your current status, it’s not wise to truly fall out with them!”

If they really killed that group, Ice Heart Valley and Wenqing Sect would surely go to war. Once those two top Sects clashed, the entire Northern Territory would be engulfed in chaos.

Still, Yang Kai couldn’t figure out why the Wenqing Sect people were making things difficult for that Ice Heart Valley disciple below.

“Many thanks, Senior Brother, for your help. May I ask your esteemed name? Zi Yu will surely repay you in the future!” The young woman below cupped her fists gratefully toward Yang Kai. If not for his intervention, even if she managed to escape, she would have paid a heavy price. She had a forbidden technique at hand—if she used it, Cao Yang’s group would never stop her, but after using it she would be unable to use her strength for three months. She’d never escape the Northern Territory then.

"Senior Sister, we’re all family here, no need to be so polite." Fan Xin smiled warmly at the girl named Zi Yu.

"Family?" Zi Yu frowned, not understanding what Fan Xin meant.

Fan Xin beamed, pointed to several women on the ship, and said, “We’re all from Ice Heart Valley too. Judging by the secret techniques and skills you used just now, you must be from Ice Heart Valley as well, right? So we’re all family.”

They had only just returned to the Northern Territory a few days ago, and already they’d run into a Senior Sister from the same Sect, and one with considerable strength at that. Fan Xin was naturally delighted and didn’t hide their identities, telling Zi Yu directly.

But to her surprise, after hearing this, Zi Yu’s expression changed, deep wariness flashing in her beautiful eyes. She quietly stepped back a few paces, biting her red lips as she said, “Did you come to capture me?”

Fan Xin was stunned. “Senior Sister, what are you talking about?”

Zi Yu said, “Since we’re all fellow disciples, I won’t attack you. Go back and tell my Master that Zi Yu has implicated her. It’s my own unfilial conduct. When I’ve achieved success in my cultivation, I’ll return to Ice Heart Valley to fulfill my duty!”

With that, her delicate figure flickered, transforming into a rainbow that shot off into the distance, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Yang Kai and the others were left staring at each other in confusion.

"What was that Senior Sister… doing?" Fan Xin frowned deeply. They had just saved her, and not only did she not thank them, but after hearing they were also from Ice Heart Valley, she became so wary and said a bunch of inexplicable things. It was truly baffling.

"Something must have happened at Ice Heart Valley," Yang Kai said gravely.

Fan Xin was startled and looked at Yang Kai in surprise. "Senior Brother Yang, how do you know?"

Yang Kai said, "Ice Heart Valley and Wenqing Sect are both top Sects in the Northern Territory. By rights, there shouldn’t be any conflict. But just now, that group from Wenqing Sect was besieging Zi Yu—that’s already very strange. And then there were Zi Yu’s words before she left…"

Fan Xin’s expression shifted repeatedly, and she began to understand.

Why was Zi Yu being besieged by Wenqing Sect, and why did she become so wary after learning they were also from Ice Heart Valley? Clearly, something major had happened there.

"Senior Brother Yang, let’s hurry back to the Sect." Fan Xin urged anxiously. She didn’t know what had happened at Ice Heart Valley, but she wanted to go see for herself. Because of Bing Yun, she felt a connection to the Sect she’d never visited, and naturally didn’t want anything to happen to it.

Yang Kai nodded and glanced toward the ship’s cabin.

He was certain that Bing Yun had sensed everything happening outside, but he didn’t know why she seemed so unconcerned.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai redirected the multi-deck ship toward Ice Heart Valley.

Fan Xin was insistent, so Yang Kai could only speed up the ship. Five days later, a massive city appeared ahead.

"That’s Binglun City. It’s only about an hour's journey from Ice Heart Valley. Let’s enter the city first," Bing Yun’s voice suddenly sounded in Yang Kai’s ear. He nodded and landed the multi-deck ship outside the city gates.

Soon after, he led a group of women through the gates and into Binglun City.

As soon as he set foot in the city, Yang Kai suddenly frowned and called out in a low voice, "Senior, why are there so many Emperor Realm experts in this city?"

After entering, he sensed the presence of seven or eight Emperor Realm experts. This was clearly abnormal.

Concealing her cultivation and blending into the crowd, Bing Yun shook her head slightly. "I don’t know. Binglun City is usually just a transit hub for Ice Heart Valley’s dealings with the outside world. There shouldn’t be so many Emperor Realm experts here. Maybe something big is happening. But let’s not get involved for now—I still need a few more days to fully recover."

Last time, Bing Yun had acted before her injuries had healed, fighting Jiang Zhouzi, which meant she now needed even more time to recuperate. Otherwise, she would have been fully healed by now.

The next few days were critical for her recovery, so she didn’t want any more trouble.

"Let’s find a place to stay and wait for Senior to recover before heading to Ice Heart Valley," Yang Kai suggested.

Bing Yun had no objections.

So, the group found an inn in the city. Although Fan Xin was worried about the Sect and wanted to go as soon as possible, with her Master still healing, she didn’t dare act rashly. She could only stay in the inn with her Junior Sisters, quietly waiting.

Yang Kai had no intention of going out either. Now that he was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, just a step away from advancing to the Emperor Realm, he was even more diligent in his cultivation, eager to glimpse its mysteries.

Three days later, while meditating in his room, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes with a suspicious look, then stood up and walked out the door.

A moment later, he arrived at another room. Before he could knock, Bing Yun’s voice came from inside: "Come in!"

Yang Kai entered, turned a corner, and saw Bing Yun meditating. He asked, "Senior, have your injuries healed?"

Bing Yun shook her head. "I still need two or three more days."

Yang Kai was surprised. "Then why did you call me over, Senior?"

He had come because he heard Bing Yun summon him. He thought she was healed, but that wasn’t the case.

Bing Yun frowned slightly and, without answering directly, pointed ahead. "Sit down. I’ll explain."

Yang Kai obediently sat down in front of her.

Bing Yun pondered for a moment, then said, "Back when I came from the Hengluo Star Domain to the Star Realm, I was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. You know, that level of cultivation is unrivaled in the Star Domain, but in the Star Realm, it’s nothing."

Yang Kai nodded, indicating he understood well.

People like Chi Yue, Ai Ou, and others were all overlords in the Hengluo Star Domain. A single stomp from them would shake the whole Star Domain. But after coming to the Star Realm, even finding cultivation resources was a struggle. The number one expert of that era, Wudao, had even perished.

Bing Yun continued, "Once, I encountered a great danger and nearly lost my life, but a great expert saved me. He even damaged his own vitality to pull me back from the brink of death. Later, under his careful care, I slowly recovered. He taught me many things. In all my years of cultivation, if I have a Master, he is the only one. Unfortunately, he only taught me for half a year before wandering off."

Yang Kai praised, "That expert must have been a magnanimous man who never sought repayment."

Bing Yun smiled slightly. "Indeed. He saved me without asking for anything in return. With my strength at the time, I was nothing but an ant to him, yet he was willing to exhaust his own vitality for me. Thanks to his half year of guidance, my cultivation in the Star Realm has been smooth ever since."
