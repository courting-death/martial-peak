## Chapter 1639 — Chi Huo

"Very well — I'll find an opportunity to speak with him. At the very least I must learn whether Lord Luo Hai came to Chi Lan Star because of him, and precisely what the cause was. If it turns out he has nothing to do with this matter, we can still consider ways to recruit him later; but if Lord Luo Hai truly came because of him..." Bing Long sighed softly. "Then in that case we can only hand him over to secure the safety of Ice Heart Valley."

"The Valley Lord is wise!" the elders answered in unison; there was no objection to the decision.

Yang Kai's talent and potential were indeed outstanding — able to fight above his rank, and very likely in the future to advance to the Void King Realm.

But that was still the future. At present he was only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

The elders could clearly weigh a fear of a Star Lord who had reached the Second Stage of the Void King Realm against a beautiful yet intangible future; they knew which mattered more.

"When the Valley Lord goes to see him, this elder will also pay him a visit!" Suddenly a voice came from outside the Ice Palace — Ran Yunting.

Everyone turned and saw Great Elder Ran Yunting stride forward.

"Oh? Great Elder is interested in him as well?" Bing Long was a little surprised.

Ran Yunting's strength was not inferior to hers by much, and since she had brought Su Yan back to Icebound Island over thirty years ago she had devoted herself to cultivating that inner disciple and paid little attention to other people or matters.

For her now to take the initiative to meet Yang Kai was naturally astonishing to Bing Long.

"I'm interested. A talent this outstanding naturally draws my attention," Ran Yunting said with a faint smile.

For some reason everyone felt a bone-deep chill. They looked at one another, bewildered.

At the same time, tens of millions of li away from Icebound Island, in the Fire Radiance Sect's main headquarters that rivaled Ice Heart Valley in reputation.

The Fire Radiance Sect's main headquarters was located on Chi Lan Star's best training grounds; its headquarters were picturesque, the land blessed with outstanding people, the environment beautiful and the Spiritual Qi abundant, so disciples cultivated there at great speed.

The two great powers on Chi Lan Star had always been evenly matched. But in recent years the Fire Radiance Sect had managed to gain some advantage in its conflict with Ice Heart Valley. The reason, as rumor held, was that Ice Heart Valley's Grand Elder had suffered a mistake in cultivation and been injured.

A Grand Elder was naturally a Void King Realm expert. Though she would not interfere in the squabbles of juniors, such news could nonetheless affect the morale of Ice Heart Valley.

The Fire Radiance Sect had been steady and deliberate these past years and seemed to be subtly suppressing Ice Heart Valley.

South of the Fire Radiance Sect's headquarters, in a bamboo grove, stood several thatched huts.

The huts were extremely crude and unremarkable. Mountains wrapped behind them and a lake lay ahead — the location was not bad. Around the huts, bamboo of a fiery red color grew everywhere.

At that moment two people sat cross‑legged on stone pedestals before one of the huts; a chessboard sat on the stone table between them as black and white stones clashed incessantly.

On the left sat an old man whose hair and beard were all fire-red. Though his years appeared advanced his complexion was warm and fresh like a newborn's, and an imposing presence emanated from his every gesture.

Opposite him sat a middle-aged man with his hair bound beneath a golden crown and clad in a golden robe.

Thirty zhang away from the two, another refined-looking man stood silently like a statue, unmoving; only when he glanced at them did a trace of longing occasionally appear on his face.

The red-haired elder and the golden-crowned man continued their contest, and from that peculiar board came the clashing sounds of metal and the thunder of a thousand steeds — utterly stirring to the heart.

The red-haired elder played at an astonishing speed; often without much thought a stone would be placed as if it had been casually plucked, whereas the golden-crowned man frequently furrowed his brow and pondered solemnly before placing a move.

On the board the black and white auras grew more conspicuous; the black stones belonging to the red-haired elder held the upper hand, forming an encircling posture to attack the white stones.

Time passed, the golden-crowned man's thinking grew longer, and his expression increasingly grave.

The red-haired elder made no haste; while waiting he merely closed his eyes and meditated.

At a certain moment the golden-crowned man suddenly displayed a sly smile and placed a white stone. The white stones' trapped position bloomed like dead wood springing back to life and was immediately solved, while the once-ferocious black stones suddenly fell into the inferior position.

The red-haired elder's eyes widened in astonishment.

After thinking for a long while he slowly shook his head and smiled wryly, "Brother Luo Hai, your chess has indeed improved greatly. I am no match for you."

The golden-crowned man smiled faintly, "Chi Huo, it is not that my skill has surpassed yours, it is that you are too impetuous. Your intentions and moves are written on the board; I only need to meet each move and dismantle it."

"Straightforward play is the most fun," the red-haired elder said, shaking his head and laughing. "Life is short; there isn't time to agonize over this and that. Ah — I lost this round."

"I concede!"

The red-haired elder turned his head and looked toward a nearby spot, beckoning with his hand.

The refined man who had stood thirty zhang away then stepped forward and came before them, saluting respectfully: "Wei Qing greets the Grand Elder and pays respects to Senior Luo Hai!"

Luo Hai gave a slight nod and lifted his hand in a faint, supporting gesture.

The refined man was Sect Master Wei Qing of the Fire Radiance Sect, a man of considerable status. Though Luo Hai was the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, he did not act arrogantly; moreover, he and Grand Elder Chi Huo were on good terms, so Wei Qing was indeed his junior.

"What brings you here?" Chi Huo lifted his head to look at Wei Qing.

Wei Qing replied respectfully, "Grand Elder, the matter that Senior Luo Hai instructed us to investigate may now have a lead."

A flash of light flickered in Luo Hai's eyes, quickly masked by restraint.

Chi Huo said coolly, "Speak."

"A few days ago, scouts saw Ice Heart Valley's Thirteenth Elder Yu Xueqing bring a young man through a Space Array into Icebound Island. Although Ice Heart Valley's defenses there are tight and the scouts could not see the young man's face clearly, it is likely the person Senior Luo Hai seeks."

Having spoken, Wei Qing stood to one side in respectful silence.

Though he ranked just beneath the top on Chi Lan Star, when facing Luo Hai and Chi Huo he dared not be presumptuous and behaved with extreme propriety.

"Brother Luo Hai, what do you think?" Chi Huo looked to Luo Hai.

"Icebound Island is Ice Heart Valley's main headquarters; for ten thousand years no man has set foot there. That they allowed a man in this time shows they value him highly. He could well be the one I seek. Heh — it seems they want to use that boy for something."

"Indeed. They probably want to curry favor with you, Brother Luo Hai. They likely hope you'll act as mediator and resolve their current crisis," Chi Huo said. Despite his rough manner, his mind was keen.

Luo Hai smiled without speaking.

"By the way, Brother Luo Hai, at this point can you tell me — what exactly do you want that boy for? What about him is worthy of someone like you paying attention?" Chi Huo asked, puzzled. He had wondered this for a long time and had never gotten a straight answer.

The only things that could make someone like Luo Hai care would be a secret to breakthrough to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, or a Void King‑Grade Upper-Level secret treasure. Apart from those, nothing in the world would attract Luo Hai's interest.

If Luo Hai cared for such a thing, then Chi Huo would naturally care as well.

But every time he probed around, Luo Hai would not answer directly, leaving Chi Huo frustrated.

"Did I not tell you? That boy, with cultivation at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, passed the Blood Prison Trial — his aptitude is not ordinary. I have no heir to pass my legacy to, so I planned to take him as a disciple to inherit my lineage!" Luo Hai said with a smile.

"Is that so! Then that boy is fortunate indeed." Chi Huo laughed heartily and nodded, inwardly disdainful, clearly not taking it seriously.

Luo Hai now stood at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm and possessed Stellar Origin; in the future he very well might break through to the Third Stage. Why would he be in a hurry to accept disciples and pass on his legacy?

Besides, if he were to accept disciples he would not need to make such a fuss; countless geniuses would flock and contend to become his disciple. Why would Luo Hai chase someone down and try to force them to accept being his student?

No matter how heaven-defying a talent was, it could not make Luo Hai act so undignified.

There had to be something fishy.

"Since Ice Heart Valley has already found that boy, then I will go pay them a visit," Luo Hai said, rising slowly.

"I will go with you!" Chi Huo chuckled.

Luo Hai regarded him thoughtfully and nodded, "Very well. Icebound Island's Icebound Great Array is formidable; with Brother Chi Huo accompanying me this trip should be easy."

He showed no sign of refusal.

"Oh, and Wei Qing, summon your worthless boy here to meet me — I'll take him to appreciate the scenery of Icebound Island!" Chi Huo called to Wei Qing.

"Grand Elder intends to bring Wei Feng to Icebound Island?" Wei Qing was taken aback, alarmed: "That boy..."

He knew all too well what kind of person his son was.

As the Sect Master's son, his aptitude was nothing special. Over the years he had been given countless spiritual pills and thrice the cultivation resources, and Wei Qing himself had once enlightened him, yet only now had he barely reached the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Although he had entered the Origin Returning Realm, he could not produce his own Shi.

In this lifetime his son would likely remain at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; he lacked the actual strength that realm should grant.

In other words, he was only slightly better than a Saint King. Any Origin Returning Realm practitioner who could form Shi would easily defeat him.

The Grand Elder disliked Wei Feng and thought he had disgraced the sect; on one occasion he had even struck him down with a single palm and left him grievously wounded.

So why would the Grand Elder now do this and bring him to Icebound Island?

"Stop whining and go when you're told! I won't kill him," Chi Huo snapped angrily when Wei Qing hesitated.

"Yes!" Wei Qing's face flickered with fear and he hurried away.

Luo Hai frowned at Chi Huo, unsure what game he was playing.

Icebound Island was no ordinary place. Even Luo Hai, who stood at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, feared the power of the Icebound Great Array. The two of them would be enough for this trip — why bring along a junior at all?

And what was worse, the junior Chi Huo disliked intensely.

After pondering a moment Luo Hai suddenly understood and shook his head bitterly.

Chi Huo laughed heartily and said, “Brother Luo Hai, allow this old man to borrow a tiger’s might this time.”

"Just this once, but don't go too far. Luo Li's strength is not weak. If she were pushed too far and the Icebound Great Array were activated, both of us would be in for a hard time."

"I know that well, Brother Luo Hai — rest assured."
