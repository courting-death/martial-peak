## Chapter 273 — Hidden Cloud Peak

After spending a full half incense time, Yang Kai quietly circulated his Primordial Qi, drawing the turbid energy in his mouth and forcing it to his brow.

To outsiders, a faint black aura had clearly appeared between Yang Kai's brows.

Qin Ze was immediately astonished.

This was clearly a sign that would only appear at the final moment of the test. Among the hundreds of alchemists who had participated earlier, only Wang Qiren and Dong Qingyan had reached this step; however, the former had failed at the last moment, while the latter had succeeded in one go.

How could a mere guard achieve this?

Could it be that he was another genius suitable for alchemy?

Qin Ze felt nervous, staring deeply at Yang Kai, his heart rising to his throat. Master Xiao had personally told him that for this test, as long as he could find a suitable successor, he would be very satisfied.

Now that Dong Qingyan had passed, if another one succeeded... wouldn’t Master Xiao be laughing his head off? The lineage of Cloud Hidden Peak would not only have successors but might also flourish.

Just as Qin Ze was feeling extremely anxious, the black aura between Yang Kai's brows suddenly vanished. Qin Ze held his breath, his eyes wide open.

The outcome would be determined in the next moment!

In the tense waiting, Yang Kai showed no reaction. After a long while, Qin Ze's eyes were starting to feel sore, only to see that a black aura had reappeared between Yang Kai's brows.

What was going on?

Qin Ze was utterly confused. The reaction of this young man was not like Wang Qiren, who had spat out a mouthful of black blood, nor was it like Dong Qingyan, who had successfully forced out black smoke. Why was this black aura appearing and disappearing repeatedly? It contradicted what Master Xiao had said before.

While he was anxiously puzzled, the black aura disappeared again.

Before he could calm down, the black aura reappeared.

...

Qin Ze's heart was in turmoil, rising and falling with the black aura's appearance and disappearance. This kind of uncertain waiting was truly tormenting, especially since the various manifestations of the other party were oscillating between success and failure, making it even more agonizing.

The black aura fluctuated at least a dozen times before the young man suddenly opened his mouth, expelling a thick stream of turbid energy.

With the expulsion of this turbid energy, the young man seemed to wilt significantly, his head drooping, losing all vitality.

Damn! You finally spat it out. Qin Ze cursed inwardly, thinking that if you kept this up, my heart might not be able to take it.

But... how could such a situation arise?

Qin Ze furrowed his brow in deep thought. Could it be that this young man's qualifications could barely meet Master Xiao's established standards, which was why he struggled so much to pass the test? Thinking this way made some sense.

"Senior Brother Qin..." Dong Qingyan looked at Qin Ze, hesitatingly asking, "How did he do?"

Only then did Qin Ze come to his senses, laughing heartily, "Hmm. Not bad, not bad. Although his qualifications are slightly inferior to Junior Sister's, he... has barely passed."

Another one passed?

The crowd below was left in a daze by this statement.

Among all those who had come on stage, not a single one had succeeded. Even Wang Qiren had been forced to spit out a mouthful of black blood. But now, there was a Common-Grade Middle-Level alchemist who had passed. This was already acceptable, as she was the young lady of the Dong Family, a prominent family that could cultivate such talent.

But what about that guard?

He was merely the attendant of Young Lady Dong, and such a person had also passed?

"Senior Qin, that kid must have cheated," someone shouted from below.

"Yeah, Senior, this person doesn’t even know how to refine pills. How could he pass Master Xiao's test?" 

"He must have used some despicable means to achieve this; we refuse to accept it!"

...

Qin Ze's smile immediately froze, his eyes flashing like lightning as he swept a glance at the crowd below, coldly snorting, "This is a Poison Pill personally refined by Master Xiao. No one can cheat. Even if someone from the Divine Roaming Realm takes this pill, without alchemical qualifications, they still cannot endure it. If anyone is unconvinced, feel free to come up and try. But if anyone dares to question anything, then you are insulting my Yao Wang Valley and disrespecting Master Xiao!"

With such a heavy accusation, the crowd immediately fell silent.

"Damn, even a guard who can’t refine pills has passed. I don’t believe it!" an alchemist gritted his teeth and rushed onto the high platform.

Many people followed suit.

Moments later, a large group of people was poisoned...

A whole medicinal cauldron of Poison Pills, at least five or six hundred pills, had been consumed by noon, but in the end, only Dong Qingyan and Yang Kai had safely passed the test.

Many others had experienced the same fate as Wang Qiren, reaching the final step but ultimately failing, causing people to sigh in regret.

Only at this moment did everyone realize that Master Xiao was not trying to recruit disciples widely; he had set such a high difficulty test solely to find a suitable heir.

As the test concluded, Qin Ze walked over with a smile, "Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters, when will you come with me to Cloud Hidden Peak? If Master Xiao knows that two people have passed this time, he will definitely be very happy."

Yang Kai maintained a stern face, saying nothing, his expression cold. His current identity was that of a mere attendant, and he naturally could not overstep.

Dong Qingyan smiled and said, "I want to go say goodbye to my brother."

"Oh, let's go together. Hurry and say your farewells, and then we’ll head to Cloud Hidden Peak!"

He was eager to bring them into Yao Wang Valley.

On the third floor of the Dong Family's pharmacy, Dong Qinghan wore a bitter smile. The news of Dong Qingyan passing Master Xiao's test had already reached his ears.

Although he knew his sister had been obsessed with alchemy since childhood, he never expected her to achieve such a feat.

Becoming a disciple of Xiao Fusheng! This was a good opportunity that no one could refuse. But after all, she was a girl, raised in luxury since childhood, and now suddenly changing to a strange environment, he wondered if she could handle it.

But now it was too late to change anything. Unless the Dong Family was willing to sever ties with Yao Wang Valley, they could forget about taking anyone from Yao Wang Valley again.

The Dong Family would naturally not sever ties with Yao Wang Valley; the implications were too great.

Just as he was bitterly smiling, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians suddenly moved, whispering, "Miss and Young Master Yang are coming, along with another person, who should be a steward from Yao Wang Valley."

Dong Qinghan was taken aback and quickly stood up, "Let’s go greet them!"

Before he reached the door, he heard the sound of hurried footsteps coming up the stairs.

Opening the door, he saw Dong Qingyan bouncing up the stairs with a light and lively step.

"Brother, brother, I succeeded!" Dong Qingyan couldn't wait to share the good news with Dong Qinghan.

Dong Qinghan maintained a stern face, reaching out to tap her head, scolding, "Nonsense! Such a big matter, why didn’t you discuss it with me first?"

Dong Qingyan covered her little head, still smiling cheerfully, showing no signs of anger.

Just after Dong Qinghan finished scolding, Qin Ze, who had followed closely, lightly coughed.

Dong Qinghan quickly straightened his expression and hurriedly saluted, "Junior here greets Senior Qin!"

"Mm." Qin Ze nodded lightly, frowning as he said, "Young Master Dong, since your younger sister has passed the test, she is now a disciple of my Yao Wang Valley, and also Master Xiao's disciple, making her my Junior Sister. Although she is still a member of your Dong Family, you cannot treat her carelessly!"

Dong Qinghan was stunned.

Qin Ze continued to casually reprimand, "Alchemists are a noble profession, unlike you brutes who wield weapons. It requires intellect. Do you understand? What if you injure her head? My Junior Sister is a genius in alchemy; if you really injure her, can you bear that loss? Can you withstand Master Xiao's wrath? Can your Dong Family withstand the anger of Yao Wang Valley?"

This round of scolding left Young Master Dong speechless and drenched in sweat.

Qin Ze snorted lightly and continued, "You call me Senior, but now that Yan'er is my Junior Sister, she ranks higher than you. How can you strike her? Don’t you understand this simple reasoning? Hmm?"

Dong Qinghan was left dumbfounded, wanting to cry but having no tears.

He thought to himself, I just came to greet you; I didn’t say anything! Everyone knows that Yao Wang Valley is overbearing in protecting their own, but... but she is my sister! Can’t I even teach her a lesson? I’ve never seen such overprotection.

And they hadn’t even entered Yao Wang Valley yet; if they did, what would happen?

However, although Young Master Dong was extremely frustrated, he was also quite pleased inside. With Qin Ze protecting his sister like this, it seemed she wouldn’t suffer any hardships after entering Yao Wang Valley.

"I was wrong!" Dong Qinghan admitted obediently.

Only then did Qin Ze nod lightly, "Hmm, it seems you are not an uncultured person, and knowing to correct your mistakes is a good thing."

A forced smile appeared on Dong Qinghan's chubby face, looking more awkward than crying.

Qin Ze turned to Dong Qingyan and said, "Junior Sister, matters should be dealt with swiftly. If you have anything to discuss with Young Master Dong, keep it brief. I will wait for you below."

With that, he floated down the stairs.

He had come up just to support Dong Qingyan.

After Qin Ze left, Dong Qinghan gritted his teeth as he looked at his sister, "So you have some capability now, should I call you Senior Dong now?"

"Hehe..." Dong Qingyan giggled, stepping forward to shake her brother's arm, softly saying, "About father..."

Dong Qinghan shook his head helplessly, "I will tell him; I believe he won’t object."

"Mm, father will be proud of me." Dong Qingyan nodded quickly, feeling a huge weight lifted off her heart.

Turning to Yang Kai, Dong Qinghan whispered, "Be careful in Yao Wang Valley; if anything happens, don’t involve Yan'er!"

He was referring to the matters concerning Dan Sheng Peak.

"I understand," Yang Kai replied.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan descended the stairs.

Qin Ze and the three disciples of Yao Wang Valley had long been impatiently waiting. As soon as they saw them come down, they hurried back as if their butts were on fire.

The twelve peaks of Yao Wang Valley were arranged in a circular formation, with Cloud Hidden Peak located near the center, only two peaks away from Dan Sheng Peak.

Upon reaching the foot of the peak and looking up, they could only see a faintly visible rugged mountain path leading to the top, flanked by lush greenery, a picturesque scene.

At the foot of the mountain stood a stone tablet, on which the three characters "Cloud Hidden Peak" were carved in a vigorous and powerful style.

In the lower right corner of the stone tablet, there was also a line of blood-red small characters.

Yang Kai focused his eyes and saw that the small characters read: "Those who trespass shall die!"
