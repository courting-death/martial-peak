## Chapter 1 — The Cliff (Part One)

As Yang Kai moved, the three disciples from Ghost King Valley simultaneously sneered. Jin Hao and Yu Chengkun, while seeing Yang Kai rushing towards the woman, showed no signs of panic; instead, their sneers deepened, clearly believing that the woman had enough strength to easily block Yang Kai.

The woman’s expression remained unchanged. True essence quietly gathered within her, and her beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai as if she were staring at a dead man, devoid of any emotional fluctuations.

When Yang Kai was about five zhang away from her, the primordial qi within him erupted violently.

Unyielding Will!

If he wanted to escape from a True Essence Realm warrior, Yang Kai dared not hold back.

Sensing the rapid surge of Yang Kai's strength, the woman's complexion slightly darkened. Her pale hand trembled as several almost imperceptible threads flew out from her fingertips, like spirit snakes emerging from their holes, aiming for the vital points around Yang Kai.

These threads were not formed from true essence but were made of a type of silk, tough in texture, and after being infused with true essence, they became sharp as knives. They were not considered treasures, thus could be used here.

Realizing the danger hidden within those threads, Yang Kai's expression grew serious. His mind raced, and in a moment of inspiration, he forced out a few drops of Yang Liquid from his fingertips.

As soon as the drops appeared, they transformed into the shape of a shield under Yang Kai's will, layered several times, blocking in front of him.

Just as he completed this, the threads attacked.

With a soft "pu," the shield made of Yang Liquid was pierced through, but with that slight obstruction, Yang Kai managed to avoid a fatal blow, allowing the threads to pierce through unimportant areas instead, exiting his body.

His body involuntarily trembled as Yang Kai lunged in front of the woman, unleashing several punches in quick succession.

The woman sneered repeatedly. Her ghostly claws tore through the air, clashing with Yang Kai's strikes. Her sharp nails even ripped away a piece of flesh from Yang Kai's hand.

With a muffled grunt, Yang Kai's complexion turned even paler, but leveraging the force from their exchanges, he leaped over the woman's head and, upon landing, quickly unfolded his steps to dash outward.

"Come back!" the woman shouted angrily, her silk threads snapping straight as she forcefully yanked them back. However, Yang Kai's body was not pulled back; he merely paused slightly before swiftly fleeing, leaving several trails of blood in midair.

A flicker of shock flashed in the woman’s eyes, while Jin Hao and Yu Chengkun, who had been watching leisurely, were also taken aback.

"What happened?" Jin Hao flew over and asked, puzzled. His junior sister's silk threads were incredibly tough. Having pierced into that brat's body, how could they not restrain him?

"Cut off!" the woman looked at the severed silk thread, a pang of pain surged in her heart. Her face darkened with murderous intent as she stamped her foot and said, "What are you waiting for? Chase him!"

Yu Chengkun narrowed his eyes and immediately darted after Yang Kai, with Jin Hao and the woman hurriedly following.

In another location, Yang Kai was almost using all his strength to escape.

After finally opening a gap, he paid a hefty price for it. If he were surrounded by those three again, he might really have to use the Wings of Yang Flame.

His self-created footwork was pushed to the limit, yet there was still a faint shadow pursuing him relentlessly.

It was that fastest disciple from Ghost King Valley! Jin Hao and the woman were slower than Yu Chengkun in terms of footwork, so they fell behind.

After running for half a day, Yu Chengkun still relentlessly chased after Yang Kai, like a shadow. Even as Yang Kai pushed his speed to the limit, he could not shake him off. This behavior indicated Yu Chengkun's determination to kill Yang Kai.

Yang Kai felt a surge of anger.

Ahead, a group of demon beasts appeared, about four or five in number, no more than a hundred zhang away. Yang Kai's heart hardened. Instead of avoiding them, he charged directly towards them.

As he weaved through them, he managed to escape the gathering of demon beasts. In a hurried glance back, he saw that Yu Chengkun had also emerged unscathed, not hindered by the group of beasts at all.

At a certain speed, it was indeed possible to evade most battles here; fifth-tier demon beasts found it nearly impossible to pursue.

"Kid from Lingxiao Pavilion, even if you run to the ends of the earth, you can’t escape my tracking. Give up on that thought," Yu Chengkun shouted while chasing, "Your speed is indeed impressive, but you are only in the Separation and Union Realm. How long can your primordial qi last? Sooner or later, you will run out of qi, and when that time comes, it will be your death. Stop obediently, and I will give you a quick end. Otherwise, if I catch you, you will wish you were dead!"

Yu Chengkun was also somewhat embarrassed and angry. His speed was among the best in the True Essence Realm, yet he was now chasing after a Separation and Union Realm warrior, kicking up dust. He was secretly astonished by Yang Kai's swift movements and increasingly furious, thinking that once he caught Yang Kai, he would definitely make him suffer.

Yang Kai ignored his threats, running while secretly circulating his primordial qi to heal his injuries. He was not worried about running out of qi; he was instead observing his surroundings for a chance to turn the tables.

As he sprinted, Yang Kai deliberately ran towards the areas where the demon beasts were gathered, climbing mountains and cutting through thorns. He had no idea how far he had run, but Yu Chengkun had not fallen far behind. Instead, Jin Hao and the woman from Ghost King Valley had vanished from sight.

Yet Yang Kai still dared not stop. If it were only Yu Chengkun, he might have a chance to fight back, but Jin Hao and the woman would definitely catch up, and stopping would mean death.

After a full day, Yang Kai had no idea how far he had run, but Yu Chengkun was still like a leech, refusing to give up.

As he ran, Yang Kai burst out of the dense forest and directly charged towards a cliff.

Finally, he had reached his destination. Yang Kai couldn't help but feel relieved! Earlier, while running, he had observed this cliff, which towered about ten thousand zhang high, with clouds swirling and mist rising below, creating an awe-inspiring scene.

Half a day ago, upon seeing this cliff, Yang Kai realized that his opportunity had come. That was why he had led Yu Chengkun all the way here.

Coming to a halt, he gasped for breath and turned to look back.

From the forest, Yu Chengkun also rushed out. Upon seeing the terrain here, he froze for a moment before bursting into wild laughter, stepping forward with a sinister grin, "Run, why don’t you keep running? You little bastard, your strength isn’t high, but your speed is quite fast, making me chase you for so long."

He was already confident of victory! Yang Kai's escape route was blocked by him, and ahead was a sheer cliff. A mere Separation and Union Realm warrior was effectively forced into a corner, with nowhere to run.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, his expression cold as he stared at him, remaining motionless.

"Why aren’t you running anymore?" Yu Chengkun coldly scrutinized Yang Kai, stopping five zhang away from him.

"There's nowhere to run!" Yang Kai spoke the truth.

"Hahaha!" Yu Chengkun laughed recklessly, "So you know there’s nowhere to run!"

"Spare me!" Yang Kai said in a deep voice.

"Are you begging for mercy?" Yu Chengkun revealed a disdainful and triumphant smile, "That’s not how you should beg for mercy! You should kneel down, crawl to me, and kowtow to admit your mistakes. If I’m in a good mood, I might spare your life!"

"I have no enmity with you; why must you go to such lengths to kill me?"

Yu Chengkun sneered, "We indeed have no enmity, but our elders do. Who told you to have such bad luck? In such a vast area, you just had to run into us. Enough with the nonsense. Waste your meridians, and pray that I’ll show some mercy."

"Spare me, and I will reward you!"

Yu Chengkun's smile faded, and he said solemnly, "How many blood pearls do you have?"

Yang Kai shook his head, "The blood pearls have already been absorbed. But I have several bottles of spirit pills, all of good quality."

As he spoke, he reached into his robe and took out several bottles of pills from his Spatial Pouch, waving them in front of Yu Chengkun before putting them back.

"These are healing pills. You’ll need them to act here."

Seeing the bottles of pills, a hint of greed appeared in Yu Chengkun's eyes as he grinned, "Not bad, not bad. It seems today’s harvest is quite substantial. Kid, toss the pills over!"

"Will you let me go?" Yang Kai asked solemnly.

Yu Chengkun slowly shook his head, "Why would I let you go? Killing you gives me a blood pearl, and those pills are still mine. I never make a loss in my transactions."

"If you think that way, you will end up with nothing!" Yang Kai's expression turned fierce as he slowly took a few steps back, pretending to jump off the cliff.

Yu Chengkun's face darkened, and he shouted, "You’re asking for trouble! I don’t believe you have the guts to jump!"

As he spoke, he shifted his foot and charged towards Yang Kai.

But to Yu Chengkun's astonishment, Yang Kai actually revealed a hint of a smile and then leaped back over ten zhang.

Is he really jumping? Yu Chengkun's eyes widened in shock, never expecting Yang Kai to be so decisive. He thought Yang Kai was just joking; after all, as a Separation and Union Realm warrior, he couldn’t fly, and jumping off such a high cliff would surely mean certain death. Staying behind to fight him might have given him a slim chance of survival.

But now, Yang Kai truly leaped off the cliff without a second thought, leaving Yu Chengkun momentarily stunned.

Immediately, Yu Chengkun was filled with rage. This brat would rather die than let him gain any advantage; he was truly ruthless.

As his thoughts raced, Yu Chengkun hurriedly rushed to the edge of the cliff and jumped down.

What was a ten-thousand-zhang cliff to him? He was a True Essence Realm warrior; once his primordial qi transformed into true essence, he could fly! As long as he quickly killed this little brat from Lingxiao Pavilion, with his strength, he could easily fly back up after taking a bit of time.

A blood pearl was secondary; those bottles of healing pills were absolutely not to be missed.

After falling down for just over ten zhang, Yang Kai looked up and saw Yu Chengkun rapidly approaching him, like a bird spreading its wings, his face filled with a fierce expression.

Yang Kai grinned. He was genuinely worried that Yu Chengkun wouldn’t jump after him. If he didn’t have the guts, then his act would have been in vain. Seeing him also jump off the cliff, Yang Kai felt a sense of relief!
