## Chapter 345 — Can More Miracles Be Created?

A sharp sound pierced the air. It seemed as if the old man's lower body had fallen into a frying pan, and the Corrupted Fountain Water unleashed its terrifying evil powers, melting a significant portion of the old man's flesh in an instant.

The old man let out a piercing scream, desperately channeling his True Yuan to resist the invading evil energy.

However, no matter how hard he tried, the sinister, inky aura continued to spread rapidly over his body.

The old man's heart shattered, and with all his strength, he attempted to leap upward. Yet, the Corrupted Fountain Water seemed to possess a massive suction force, as if invisible hands were pulling him down with great force.

He felt as though he had unintentionally fallen into a swamp; the harder he struggled, the quicker he sank.

Taking advantage of the moment, Yang Kai flew up to the old man's head, striking down with both palms in an overwhelming force akin to a mountain crushing down.

The Triple Flame Yang Explosion and soul techniques were unleashed simultaneously. Countless palm seals surged forth, each surrounded by a creeping purple ghostly light.

He aimed to annihilate the old man completely!

Despite possessing the strength of the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, the old man found himself unable to unleash his full power. Filled with frustration and anger, he was forcibly pushed into the Corrupted Fountain Water by Yang Kai.

A sharp, sorrowful wail echoed as the old man struggled in the inky depths of the fountain, unable to escape the bindings of the evil energy, sinking deeper and deeper until he vanished completely.

In just a short while, the old man's voice fell silent, meeting a tragic fate.

Yang Kai's expression turned slightly grim. He had not anticipated the strength of the Corrupted Fountain Water to be so formidable; even a Divine Roaming Realm expert could not escape its grip. While he could swim freely within the water thanks to his Proud Bone Golden Body, anyone else who fell in would likely meet the same fate as those from the Xiaoyao Sect.

Would the defense barrier of the True Yang Yuan Qi hold?

Casting a worried glance over that way, Yang Kai swiftly withdrew.

Having exerted his Divine Sense multiple times, he did feel somewhat fatigued and weak, but he did not show it.

Once he landed back on the high platform, everyone held their breath, staring at him in disbelief. It seemed unimaginable that a Fifth Stage Divine Roaming Realm master had been defeated in such a way by him.

Although everyone knew that it was not purely Yang Kai's strength but largely reliant on the evil nature of the Corrupted Fountain Water, even so, it was still astonishing.

“Cough… it looks like only we are left here,” Shen Yi said with a light cough, bringing everyone's focus back to reality.

“Yeah, they're all dead,” Leng Shan said, staring at the empty high platform, feeling somewhat dreamlike.

The Ghost King Valley had offended the Xiaoyao Sect, and she was worried about facing reprimands from her master upon returning. However, given that Yu Qing and the others had not returned, she found this outcome somewhat welcome.

Without anyone from the Xiaoyao Sect returning, they would, of course, remain oblivious to the events that transpired here.

“It’s rising!” Tao Yang shouted gravely, his gaze fixed outside.

The Corrupted Fountain Water erupted again, quickly expanding and spilling over the high platform, rising dozens of zhang high and filling the entire Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

As he looked around, everything except the high platform disappeared beneath the fountain water, and an inky darkness swallowed all light, leaving the group feeling as if they were hiding in a bubble at the bottom of the sea.

Occasionally, they could see some evil spirits swimming in the water outside the defense barrier.

The people couldn't help but feel grateful that they had not rashly left the high platform earlier; otherwise, they might have been consumed by the fountain water before even escaping the safe zone.

“Swish…” The fountain water touched the True Yang Yuan Qi barrier, creating a series of explosive sounds as the two clashing energies quickly depleted each other's strength.

Everyone's hearts grew tense, their eyes fixed on the barrier's movements.

In this situation, if the barrier broke, all but Yang Kai would meet their doom.

Boom… boom…

The sounds from the Evil Spirit Spring Eye grew increasingly intense and dense, pulling the hearts of everyone on the high platform, causing their heartbeats to accelerate with anxiety, unaware of what changes might occur.

“Puff…” It seemed as though something had shattered.

Zhao Rong of the Baoqi Sect gasped in shock, her face pale. “It seems a layer of the defense barrier has broken!”

“Is that true?” Cheng Ying's face turned ashen.

How long had it been for one layer of the barrier to be destroyed? At this rate, it wouldn’t even take a stick of incense for the high platform to become unsafe.

“It's true! I saw it!” Zhao Rong was on the verge of tears.

Sometimes, death isn't the most harrowing aspect— it can come suddenly with a sword strike before one even realizes it.

What is truly terrifying is the feeling of waiting for death, the prolonged, anxious torment, making every day feel like a year.

“What if it all breaks?” Cheng Ying asked with a mournful face.

“Bad luck!” Leng Shan rebuked sharply.

Instantly, everyone turned and gazed at Yang Kai, hoping that he could conjure more miracles to turn the tide.

Yang Kai sniffed, “I can still condense a defense barrier like this!”

Everyone's faces lit up with joy, and Shen Yi couldn't help but laugh heartily, “I said Brother Yang must have more tricks up his sleeve, haha! We needn't worry now.”

Safe within the barrier, despite being somewhat frightened, everyone mostly felt at ease.

Tao Yang furrowed his brow, a thoughtful look crossing his face as he asked in a solemn tone, “Brother Yang, approximately how many layers can you condense?”

Yang Kai briefly inspected the Yang Liquid within his Dantian and replied faintly, “Fifty layers should be fine.”

Tao Yang inhaled sharply, staring at Yang Kai as if he were a monster.

The True Yuan contained in this First Stage barrier was already incredibly vast. Fifty layers… Tao Yang could hardly imagine how much True Yuan was within Yang Kai.

However, his brow soon furrowed again as he expressed his worries, “The critical question is when will this fountain water dissipate? Even if Brother Yang exhausts himself, he can probably only maintain it for half an hour. If the fountain water is still here after that…”

Yang Kai's expression also tensed. That was precisely what he feared.

Though he himself needn't worry about his safety, the Hu sisters were still there. He couldn't just stand by and watch them die.

These twin sisters had treated him well when Yang Kai was still weak, and he felt quite nostalgic about it.

When he mentioned fifty layers, it was also the most conservative estimation.

If it came to that, he would spare no effort to carry the Hu sisters out, wrapping them with his True Yuan to ensure they came to no harm.

The reason he lingered here was simply to do his best, as he had gotten along quite well with the people of Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect.

He could only care for a few people he was familiar with in such a critical moment, even if that was a bit selfish.

At this moment, the high platform's atmosphere was heavy, filled with unspoken worries.

Hu Mei’er discreetly glanced at Yang Kai, her face devoid of worry, inching closer to him.

Hu Jiao’er noticed her sister's little move and merely smiled wryly, directing her gaze elsewhere.

“By the way, have you heard any news about my Master?” Not wanting to dwell on the dire situation, Yang Kai casually asked Hu Mei’er, inquiring about his sect.

“Your Master?” Hu Mei’er looked at him in surprise, quickly shifting her gaze away.

“Ling Taixu,” he clarified.

“Oh,” Hu Mei’er replied, her delicate brows furrowing in thought. “We don’t know. All I know is that one night, your Lingxiao Pavilion suddenly erupted in battle. It seems the Qiu Family from Zhongdu brought trouble, and the fight lasted quite a while. My father said that Sect Leader Ling seemed to have broken through to above Divine Roaming. Sect Leader Ling truly is remarkable.”

“What was the outcome of that battle?” Yang Kai asked anxiously.

“It seems to have been a stalemate. Sect Leader Ling is powerful, and with the assistance of four elders, they repelled the Qiu Family’s experts. However, they have also been missing since then.”

“That's good,” Yang Kai couldn't help but feel relieved. He had known that his Master would be fine, but the prolonged silence had still worried him.

“However, because of your Lingxiao Pavilion, our Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower are in dire straits,” Hu Mei’er glared at Yang Kai, somewhat playfully pouting, her tone scolding yet without a hint of blame.

“What happened?”

“The Evil Lord came from your Lingxiao Pavilion, and the incoming people from the Qiu Family were repelled by you. Moreover, it seems an important figure from the Qiu Family went missing and has yet to be heard from. Those people are quite domineering, blaming our Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower as well. Thus, we were forced to send people to participate in the siege of the Cangyun Evil Land to prove our innocence. That’s how my sister and I ended up here,” Hu Mei’er softly explained.

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally understood why the sisters had appeared in the Cangyun Evil Land; they had been dragged into a fight and ended up separating from others.

In unfamiliar territory, they had ventured deeper, and then encountered the scoundrels from the Xiaoyao Sect, ultimately being cornered in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

“I’m just joking with you! No one blames your Lingxiao Pavilion; it's those people who are unreasonable!” Hu Mei’er mistook Yang Kai's silence as anger, her heart racing in distress.

“Hmm, I know,” Yang Kai's expression grew darker as he asked, “What about Su Yan? Have you heard any news about her recently?”

“No!” Hu Mei’er clearly had no idea that Su Yan and the others had already traveled thousands of miles through the Void Passage, shaking her head. “Your Lingxiao Pavilion has no one left. After that important figure from the Qiu Family went missing, those incoming experts burned down the entire Lingxiao Pavilion in anger. It’s now… a complete ruin.”

Yang Kai took a deep breath and said solemnly, “I see.”

“You… take care,” sensing Yang Kai's grim demeanor, Hu Mei’er didn’t know how to comfort him, so she took the initiative to grasp his hand gently.

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

Hu Mei’er lowered her head, remaining silent, thinking that they might die soon anyway. She simply wouldn’t let go; after all, she had acted brazenly in front of him before, and even teased him boldly. However, ever since she cultivated the Consonant Spirit Technique, perhaps her temperament had been greatly influenced by her sister, and she was no longer as reckless as in the past.
