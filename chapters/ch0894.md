## Chapter 894 — Old Guy

In the observation chamber, Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong both suspected that several of the young, attractive women who had come earlier might be connected to the Saint Lord. One of them was dressed like a young married woman; her fine eyes were distant and complex, and she kept glancing toward the Nine Peaks as if she might be nursing a past entanglement the Saint Lord had left behind while roaming outside.

After all, the Saint Lord was a young man — who in their youth hadn’t been a little rakish?

Thinking this, Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong both pursed their lips and smiled softly.

The group that arrived later were mostly older figures; their strength wasn’t especially high, but that kind of long-cultivated, haughty bearing could not be faked.

Those elders were undoubtedly notable figures across the continent.

In the observation chamber, two disciples from the Sacred Land who had left earlier returned quickly, bringing orders from the Saint Lord.

Hurry and invite them in!

"He knows his place!" Shui Ling was positively pleased. After quietly informing Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong, she and several members of the Duao Alliance strode into the peak.

The elderly group followed in the same way, one group after the other, mutually independent.

But before they could go, some of the martial artists standing in line to refine pills objected. A shout rose from one place: "Two elders, who are these people? Why did they just arrive today yet get to enter the Nine Peaks ahead of us? If it’s convenient, would one of you explain?"

"Yes, yes!" another immediately echoed. "We’ve waited here in order for ten full days and still haven’t had our turn, yet they go straight in — isn’t that unfair?"

"Your Nine Heavens Sacred Land is renowned, you can bully us Divine Roaming Realm and Transcendent Realm folk if you like — there’s nothing we can do about that — but many of the people queuing here are seniors who have already reached the Saint Realm, and they’re willing to abide by your rules. Are you going to break your own regulations? Even if we agree, those seniors surely won’t accept it, right?"

That remark seemed to strike a chord. The Saint Realm practitioners waiting in line all looked displeased and turned to stare at Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong.

These people had come here without relying on rank or connections; they were guests seeking pills, minding their manners, and strictly obeying the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s rules, patiently standing in line.

But the scene before them made them uneasy.

None of the newcomers were Saint Realm, yet they had only just arrived and were being ushered in immediately; that naturally left those who had waited feeling aggrieved.

With the crowd clamoring, Shui Ling and the elderly party halted and turned to look back.

Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong realized how serious the problem could become; handled poorly, it might shatter the authority the Sacred Land had built up and breed unnecessary misunderstandings.

Smiling kindly, Yu Ying opened her lips: "Please calm yourselves; these people are friends the Saint Lord made while traveling. They’ve come to visit him today, not to ask for pill-refining services."

"Is that so?"

"Do you think I’d lie to you?" Yu Ying forced a smile.

She too suspected these people might be seeking the Sacred Land’s masters to refine pills, but since the Saint Lord had ordered they be invited in, they clearly weren’t outsiders. At such a moment one must do everything to protect the Sacred Land’s reputation.

"If those women are truly the Saint Lord’s friends, we can understand — reportedly he’s about their age; of course he might have such acquaintances. But what about those old men? How could your Saint Lord befriend people like them?" someone in the crowd shouted.

Those old men were advanced in years but not especially strong; it was easy to suspect they were mediocre cultivators who’d struggled to break through.

There were many such people in the world.

When trapped in a situation like theirs, the thing one most desired was a good pill to help one breakthrough and prolong one’s life.

Most of those waiting in line thought the same way.

Everyone turned their gaze to the group of elders, even Yun Cheng and the others who had stopped moving.

"You lot are meddlesome enough already — just wait your turn like everyone else. Since Yang Kai invited these seniors in, he surely has his reasons. Are you that bored? Don’t make a scene in front of the Sacred Land, or you might anger them and lose your chance to have pills refined," Shui Ling snapped, not sparing them.

The loudest of the complainers quickly shrank back, hiding behind others as if afraid Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong would remember their faces and come for them later.

Their shouting was only to vent their grievance; they had no real intention beyond that.

It also served to warn the Nine Heavens Sacred Land: otherwise in the future anyone could claim to be Yang Kai’s friend and be let in, and those who waited would have to wait even longer.

That would indeed be unfair to the others who’d observed the rules.

"You little girl, you sure have guts..." Among the elders, the rotund leader chuckled and looked at Shui Ling. "Aren’t you afraid they’ll come looking for trouble?"

"Why would I be?" Shui Ling giggled. "If you’re Yang Kai’s friends, then you’re my friends too. Though you’re much older than me, I guarantee no one here will bully you! Otherwise Yang Kai will teach them a lesson."

"Oh? It seems you’re close to Yang Kai," another elder said with a warm smile, stroking his beard and gazing at Shui Ling with a look that carried meaning.

"So-so," Shui Ling frowned slightly. "That fellow can be a jerk sometimes, but he’s loyal and honorable — I like him well enough."

"I find you agreeable too!" the rotund elder grinned and turned to his companions. "Old friends, what do you say? It seems some think we’ve come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land with ulterior motives. If we don’t explain, it’ll harm both this place’s and Yang Kai’s reputations."

The others had no objections and gestured for him to proceed as he liked.

The portly elder nodded slightly, then faced the crowd and boomed: "Which one of you called me an ‘old guy’ without looking? Step forward and let me see you!"

No one owned up to it.

The portly elder must have expected that and didn’t press it. Pointing at himself he announced, "This old fellow’s surname is Chang, given name Bao — remember it!"

He wore an air of arrogance, his tone anything but humble, as if he truly were a figure to be reckoned with.

Many sneered at him.

A Second Stage Transcendent Realm practitioner outside the Nine Peaks didn’t seem imposing.

But among the line of waiting cultivators, several of the stronger ones narrowed their eyes and stared at the portly elder. Gradually the image of a certain great figure in their minds overlapped with the man before them.

"The steward of the Shining City Alchemists’ Association, a Saint-Grade, Lower-Level alchemist — Chang Bao, Master Chang?" an exclamation spread, causing an uproar.

"No wonder. No wonder he looked familiar — he’s the master stationed in Shining City!"

"Why has he come here? And he actually knows the Saint Lord?"

"Who are the people alongside him?"

......

The crowd buzzed like a hive struck by a devastating technique; everyone’s attitude toward Chang Bao shifted from contempt to profound respect.

No one dared to slight a Saint-Grade alchemist.

Among those waiting, several had once gone to Shining City hoping to seek audience with that master, to beg him to refine pills — but had failed to meet him and came here seeking chance instead.

In astonishment, the names of those around Chang Bao were announced.

"I am Hong Fang!"

"I am Du Wan!"

"I am He Feng!"

"I am Kong Ruoyu!" the lone elderly woman nodded gently.

As those world-renowned names were spoken, everyone gaped in shock and fell silent.

Fragmented Star City, San Chuan City, Broken Moon City, Giant Stone City, Shining City...

The Alchemists’ Association stewards from five great cities had gathered together.

Five Saint-Grade alchemists! Their presence was so magnificent it left people astonished.

No one dared to keep shouting; they all stared dumbfounded at the five.

A peculiar illusion formed: this place didn’t seem to be the Nine Heavens Sacred Land but the Alchemists’ Council!

Why else would these five masters converge from north, south, east, and west to appear here?

Du Wan laughed heartily and stepped forward: "The five of us are friends of this place’s host; we came to pay our respects and apologize for any misunderstanding. Please do not take offense."

"No offense, Elder Du!" someone in the crowd immediately said humbly.

The Saint Realm experts present dared not show any disdain; instead they grew solemn.

Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong’s eyes brightened; they had finally understood why these five, though clearly weaker than some present, still carried themselves with an air of seniority.

Their words had also shaken the two elderesses’ hearts.

These five had come to pay respects to the Saint Lord — the very phrase suggested much.

Traditionally, juniors visit seniors; inferiors pay respects to superiors. Yet the term they used, ‘pay respects,’ implied something more equal and weighty.

Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong’s hearts surged; blood rushed through their veins.

"My eyes were poor; I failed to recognize the five masters. Please forgive me," Yu Ying hastened to say, collecting herself and speaking with humility.

"No matter. As long as your Saint Lord knows," Du Wan chuckled. "We are not strangers to him."

"Then let Yu Ying personally escort the five masters to see the Saint Lord; consider it an apology."

"Elder Yu Ying, you are too polite."

"Masters, please come this way!"

Du Wan and the others exchanged looks and then, ignoring the waiting crowd, followed closely behind Yu Ying into the interior.

As they passed beside Shui Ling and her group, Chang Bao winked at Shui Ling and said with a smile, "Little girl, why are you standing there dazed? Keep up."

"Oh." Shui Ling responded foolishly, still not quite recovered.

When she remembered how boldly she’d declared that anyone who was Yang Kai’s friend was her friend, Shui Ling wished she could vanish into a hole.

How mortifying!

Luckily the masters were generous and didn’t mock her; otherwise she’d never show her face again.
