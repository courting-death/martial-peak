## Chapter 2372 — Failed?

Five hundred li away, Ling Yinqin let out a quiet sigh. "So it really did fail?"

The grand phenomenon of heaven and earth vanished in an instant—a clear sign that the breakthrough had failed. Ling Yinqin had no idea whether Yang Kai was alive or dead. Though she didn’t know him well, witnessing a cultivator’s path cut short filled her with a sense of sorrow, as if she herself had suffered the loss.

Inside the cabin, Liu Qianyun, who had been kneeling and praying devoutly, suddenly collapsed to the floor, her pretty face turning pale and bloodless.

After a long moment, she gritted her teeth, stood up from where she was, and hurriedly rushed outside.

Whether Yang Kai was alive or dead, she had to find him—if alive, she needed to see him in person; if dead, she needed to see his body. Ling Yinqin felt that if not for her, Yang Kai would never have suffered such misfortune. With his talent, he was destined to one day stand above the Star Realm, renowned as a mighty overlord.

Liu Qianyun had just rushed onto the deck when she suddenly saw a massive multi-deck ship approaching. This ship was even larger and grander than the one Ling Yinqin and the others were on. It cut through the waves without the slightest sign of life, and no one knew when it had arrived. By the time Liu Qianyun noticed, the two ships were already very close to each other.

She looked up and happened to see the deck of the other ship crowded with martial artists. Led by a man in purple robes, they glared down with hostile intent.

Only at this moment did Ling Yinqin and the others realize what was happening. They rushed out of the cabin, and when they saw the emblem on the other ship's sail, their faces all darkened.

Liu Qianyun was preoccupied with Yang Kai's fate and had no mind to care about these people. Her delicate figure leapt up, ready to fly out, but the man in purple robes on the opposite ship's deck darkened his face, waved his hand, and with a single motion sent a sweeping palm strike toward her.

……

On the island, Yang Kai waited until Zhang Ruoxi opened her eyes before slowly flying over and landing in front of her. He hurriedly asked, "Are you feeling any discomfort?"

"Discomfort?" Zhang Ruoxi looked confused and shook her head. "No!" Then, her face lit up with joy and she said sweetly, "Sir, I broke through to the Dao Origin Realm!"

A few years ago, she never imagined she would one day break through to the Dao Origin Realm and stand at such a height. Back then, the strongest person in the Zhang Family was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. The declining family hadn't produced a Dao Origin Realm expert in many years. But ever since Yang Kai took her away from the Zhang Family, her cultivation had soared at an incredible pace. In just a few years, she had accomplished what her ancestors never could.

With such cultivation, she could have easily established herself back in Fenglin City.

Zhang Ruoxi felt immense gratitude toward Yang Kai.

She knew that if Yang Kai hadn't provided her with such a safe and stable environment to cultivate, she could never have achieved this. She also knew that if Yang Kai hadn't discovered her talent, she would never have glimpsed the mysteries of the Dao Origin Realm, even if she cultivated for a lifetime.

But now, at just seventeen years old, she had already stepped into the Dao Origin Realm. With so many years ahead of her, a bright future stretched out before her—she might even one day ascend to the Emperor Realm and glimpse the mysteries of the Great Emperor Realm.

Zhang Ruoxi's heart fluttered uncontrollably.

"Give me your hand!" Yang Kai came to her side. Although he hadn't noticed anything unusual about Zhang Ruoxi, he was still a bit uneasy and prepared to check her condition carefully.

Zhang Ruoxi blushed and extended a hand as white and delicate as lotus root.

Yang Kai placed his fingers on her wrist, channeled a thread of Origin Qi into her body, and began a careful examination.

After a moment, Yang Kai's body trembled. He looked at Zhang Ruoxi in shock and exclaimed, "How—how is this possible?"

"Sir, what's wrong? Is there something wrong with me?" Zhang Ruoxi was startled by his expression and immediately became anxious.

"No, no!" Yang Kai quickly shook his head, afraid of scaring her. But his brows furrowed even more, his face full of astonishment, as if he had seen something utterly incomprehensible.

Zhang Ruoxi remained motionless, only able to feel Yang Kai's thread of Origin Qi moving throughout her body. Although Yang Kai avoided certain private areas, the sensation still made Zhang Ruoxi's face flush, and she soon lowered her head to her chest.

But she also knew Yang Kai was only checking her condition and had no improper intentions.

After a while, Yang Kai withdrew his hand, looking at Zhang Ruoxi with a strange expression.

"Sir... what's wrong with me?" Zhang Ruoxi asked softly.

"You're fine," Yang Kai replied. "So fine it's unbelievable."

Yang Kai had thought that Zhang Ruoxi, breaking through to the Dao Origin Realm in this strange place, would surely be affected by the transforming force of heaven and earth. He had even prepared to take her to the Small Xuan Realm for treatment. But after checking, he found not a trace of transforming force in her body.

The endless transforming force that filled this world seemed to have completely evaporated after entering her.

That alone was hard to believe, but not enough to shock Yang Kai so much.

The key was that Yang Kai discovered the power in Zhang Ruoxi's body was pure Origin Qi, not Saint Yuan!

After a martial artist breaks through to the Dao Origin Realm, their power begins to transform from Saint Yuan to Origin Qi. Yang Kai himself had taken nearly a year to complete this transformation, even with the help of many Origin Condensing Pills.

People like Chi Yue, Ghost Ancestor, and Gu Cangyun, though now at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, still hadn't finished this transformation. The same was true for Liu Qianyun.

Transforming to Origin Qi is an extremely long process. Any martial artist who has just broken through to the Dao Origin Realm needs at least three to five years to complete it—if they're talented. For those less gifted, it could take eight or even ten years.

Only after all the power in the body is transformed into Origin Qi does the Dao Origin Realm foundation become truly stable, making it possible to break through to the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Yang Kai had watched Zhang Ruoxi break through on this small island, but in such a short time, she had already accomplished what would take others years.

There wasn't a trace of Saint Yuan left in her body. What filled her delicate frame was pure and powerful Origin Qi. In other words, at the moment of her breakthrough, Zhang Ruoxi had already completed the transformation to Origin Qi.

Yang Kai simply couldn't understand how such a strange thing could happen.

Still, this wasn't the first odd thing about Zhang Ruoxi. After thinking it over, Yang Kai could only attribute it to her bloodline, which was truly extraordinary and seemed to hide great secrets.

Even so, Yang Kai didn't dare be careless. He let Zhang Ruoxi stay on the island to check her condition thoroughly. After confirming there were no hidden dangers, he brought her back into the Small Xuan Realm and instructed Liu Yan and Hua Qingsi to explain the mysteries of the Dao Origin Realm to her and assist with her future cultivation.

The island was still the same, but the high-grade Purification Array set up on it was now damaged.

After collecting the Formation Foundation and flags, Yang Kai wore a bitter expression.

He still didn't know how he would explain this to Ling Yinqin when he returned. That high-grade Purification Array seemed to be extremely valuable to her, and now it was ruined in his hands. He wondered if Ling Yinqin would be angry.

Yang Kai checked the Formation Foundation and flags and found them badly damaged, making his face even more bitter.

With a sigh, he put everything away and turned to head back the way he came.

After a while, his expression changed as he stared at the two multi-deck ships anchored on the sea, his brows knitting slightly.

One of the two ships was naturally Ling Yinqin's, but the other, much larger one, he had never seen before. It was clear it had arrived while he was helping Zhang Ruoxi break through.

On the vast sea, the chances of two multi-deck ships meeting were extremely low. This large ship had probably been drawn here by the heaven-and-earth phenomenon caused by Zhang Ruoxi's breakthrough.

The bow of the big ship was pointed directly at the small island where he had come from.

The big ship was more than two or three times larger than Ling Yinqin's. Placed side by side, they looked like a grandfather and grandson.

Before Yang Kai even got close, he heard a commotion from that direction, making his expression darken. In a flash, he landed directly on the deck.

Looking around, he saw more than a dozen crew members led by Ling Yinqin confronting another group on the deck. Ling Yinqin and her people looked indignant, while the other side appeared relaxed and indifferent, as if they didn't take Ling Yinqin's group seriously at all.

As for Liu Qianyun, she was being protected behind the crew. Yang Kai saw a red palm print on her pretty face, as if she had been slapped hard. There was even a trace of blood at the corner of her mouth.

Yang Kai's face instantly darkened.

He didn't know what had happened on the ship or who the newcomers were, but it was clear Liu Qianyun had been beaten by them.

His sudden appearance clearly startled both groups confronting each other.

Liu Qianyun was the first to turn and look. When she saw Yang Kai, she forgot her own predicament and called out in a trembling voice, "Senior Brother..."

Her beautiful eyes scanned Yang Kai up and down, afraid of finding anything wrong. Only after confirming he was safe and sound, with all his limbs intact, did she finally breathe a heavy sigh of relief.

"You're actually all right?" Ling Yinqin was also surprised.

Yang Kai had definitely triggered a heaven-and-earth phenomenon just now. Even from five hundred li away, she had seen it clearly. But the phenomenon lasted only five breaths before vanishing, which meant Yang Kai's breakthrough had failed.

For a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to fail at breaking through to the Emperor Realm, how could he not suffer backlash? If lucky, his cultivation would be ruined; if unlucky, he would die on the spot.

Yet Yang Kai had returned completely unharmed.

Ling Yinqin scrutinized Yang Kai several times before confirming what she saw was real. Suddenly, her expression changed, as if she had thought of something.
