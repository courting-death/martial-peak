## Chapter 88 — Recognizing a Woman by Her Scent

Listening to the disdain in Long Hui’s words, Wen Feichen smiled and said, “To kill Yang Kai and capture that woman, naturally there is no need for their interference. However, Young Master Long, since Yang Kai and that woman intend to enter the depths of Black Wind Mountain, they must have prepared well and are unafraid of the dangers within. But we are different. Though our strength is not weak, Black Wind Mountain is fraught with peril. Setting aside the powerful beasts that dwell there, even the natural traps and poisons alone could cost us dearly. Yet, if someone were to clear the path ahead, we would have no need to worry about such hazards.”

Long Hui listened and finally understood Wen Feichen’s intention: to use the people from Fengyu Tower as pathfinders, thus avoiding potential risks.

“Indeed, Chief Wen’s considerations are thorough. That was my oversight,” Long Hui nodded slightly.

“Young Master Long is naturally gifted, but having little worldly experience and a pure heart, he simply did not consider this aspect,” Wen Feichen chuckled.

As for how to deal with these Fengyu Tower disciples afterward, both men understood each other perfectly well without needing to say more. That woman named Xia Ningshang, so young yet already possessing strength at the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, must have a powerful mentor behind her. To deal with such a person, one must either avoid offending her or eliminate her completely. The people of Fengyu Tower must not be left alive.

With arrangements made, the Blood Battle Gang finally settled down to rest.

The next day, as Wen Feichen had predicted, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang changed direction from the small town and headed directly into the Black Wind Mountain Range.

Half a day after their departure, the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower’s men dared to follow. Xia Ningshang’s strength was not weak; getting too close risked being discovered, but staying too far risked losing their trail. A half-day gap was the best balance. Wen Feichen, having roamed the martial world for many years, was skilled in tracking and was confident he would not lose the trail of these two young disciples in the forest.

Once inside Black Wind Mountain, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang naturally slowed their pace.

Without the wind rushing past from riding horses and the distance between them, the two spoke quite a bit, and after a day, they felt much closer.

At night, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang found a towering ancient tree and climbed onto its trunk to rest.

The trunk was broad, and the two sat side by side, with only a narrow gap between them. Yang Kai could almost smell the fragrance of Xia Ningshang’s body.

“Junior Sister,” after becoming familiar, Yang Kai no longer felt the previous distance and even changed how he addressed her. He felt Xia Ningshang was like a child who had not yet grown up, especially with those innocent eyes and her adorably naive way of speaking.

“Senior Sister is Senior Sister. Why add the ‘junior’?” Xia Ningshang was somewhat displeased.

“What do you have in that bundle?” Yang Kai ignored her question and instead pointed to the package she had set aside.

This question had been burning inside him for four or five days; he could no longer hold back.

“Oh, this!” Xia Ningshang was easily distracted and hugged the bundle like a precious treasure. “These are materials my master has prepared over the years. If you manage to obtain the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, I will have to refine it on the spot. The Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew is very special. Even if you obtain it, if it is not refined within an hour, it will gradually dissipate.”

“I see,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Junior Brother,” Xia Ningshang suddenly called out warmly.

“What is it?”

“I have a question to ask you.”

“Coincidentally, I have a question for you as well,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Then we must both answer honestly, alright?”

“Agreed.”

“I’ll ask first,” Xia Ningshang said eagerly.

“Go ahead,” Yang Kai chuckled. “I promise not to deceive you.”

Biting her lip, Xia Ningshang turned to look at Yang Kai and hesitated before speaking, “I heard from Master that when he asked you for help, you hesitated, but when you learned it was me who needed help, you agreed immediately. Why?”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai looked back at her.

Their eyes met, and Xia Ningshang blushed. The distance was too close, so she quickly looked away. “I don’t know, but Master said you had ill intentions and told me to be wary of you.”

“Old Meng said that?” Yang Kai was furious.

“Yes,” Xia Ningshang betrayed her master without a hint of guilt.

“That old fellow!” Yang Kai was indignant. What did he take me for?

“Then why did you agree so readily?”

Yang Kai glanced at her sideways, grinning mischievously, “Your master was right. I do have ill intentions toward you, which is why I agreed so quickly!”

With a sinister smile, he slowly closed the distance toward Xia Ningshang.

Startled, Xia Ningshang instinctively shrank back, then suddenly seemed to remember something and said seriously, “Junior Brother, you can’t beat me.”

That was the truth. Yang Kai knew if he pushed his luck any further, he would likely be thrown off immediately. Xia Ningshang was indeed naive, but that did not mean she was easy to deal with.

Suppressing the mischievous grin, Yang Kai’s expression turned serious as he slowly took a bottle from his bosom and carefully rubbed it.

“Because of this!” he said.

Xia Ningshang looked down in confusion and saw it was a bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment.

A scene from over two months ago flashed through her mind. Xia Ningshang immediately covered her mouth, staring at Yang Kai foolishly. She had not expected that he still kept this bottle of ointment.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Those who treat me well, I, Yang Kai, can see clearly. In over three years since joining the sect, this bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment was the first warmth and care I ever felt.”

“How do you know...” Xia Ningshang looked at him in disbelief. This ointment was indeed left to Yang Kai by her, but wasn’t he unconscious at the time?

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, “There is a saying: one can recognize a woman by her scent!”

Xia Ningshang’s face flushed deeply. That sounded rather like a rogue’s remark.

Yet her heart relaxed. So, it was simply because of this ointment, worth ten Contribution Points, that he came to help her without hesitation. Her master had indeed been mistaken.

“Your turn to ask,” having resolved her doubts, Xia Ningshang quickly changed the subject.

Yang Kai carefully put away the bottle of ointment and asked, “Shopkeeper Meng is not unable to come because of an old illness, is he?”

Xia Ningshang blushed and shyly admitted, “I drugged him into unconsciousness.”

Yang Kai was stunned, then suddenly burst into laughter, unable to stop.

“Why are you laughing?” Xia Ningshang was both embarrassed and angry. “That night, he suddenly told me not to come anymore. I had no choice but to drug him.”

Yang Kai continued laughing, and Xia Ningshang lightly punched him a few times. Afterward, she realized the gesture was somewhat too intimate and felt a bit flustered.

“I’m going to rest. You can keep laughing by yourself,” Xia Ningshang said, no longer willing to stay there. She leapt to another tree trunk and refused to pay Yang Kai any more attention.
