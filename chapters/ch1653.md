## Chapter 1653 — Fly Up to the Branch and Become a Phoenix

Chi Huo laughed heartily, his red hair dancing though there was no wind. A vast imposing aura surged from his body as he exuded boundless vigor. Pointing at Su Yan, he turned to Wei Feng behind him and said, “You little brat, this girl is yours from now on—whether you kill her or spare her, that’s up to you!”

He wasn’t satisfied with the victory before him; he intended to use it to enrage Ice Heart Valley’s higher-ups, to force them into action.

But the people of Ice Heart Valley didn’t act rashly; they only looked at him with expressions of grief bordering on despair. Even Luo Li remained aloof and unmoved.

Chi Huo felt disappointed, and a flash of disdain crossed his face.

The actions and attitude of these people from Ice Heart Valley might seem to be for the sake of their Sect’s greater good, but in truth, they had already lost the very essence of being human. He believed that after this incident, Ice Heart Valley would no longer be a force to be feared!

Wei Feng let out a sinister laugh. The wounds on both sides of his face made his voice whistle and his words come out indistinctly as he said, “How could this disciple bear to harm her? I can barely find enough time to cherish her! This disciple thanks the Grand Elder—your might towers boundlessly! I am endlessly grateful!”

Though Wei Feng was cowardly by nature, his skill at flattering superiors was exceptional. With just a few words, he had Chi Huo beaming with delight, suddenly finding this otherwise useless brat somewhat more pleasing to the eye.

"Good!" Luo Hai clapped lightly, a faint smile on his face. "I congratulate you all. I hope this helps ease relations between your two sides so you may live in harmony. After all, you are both major Sects on Chi Lan Star — constant brawling won’t do anyone any good."

"Brother Luo Hai, if there's nothing else, why not return to Fire Radiance Sect for a drink to celebrate?" Chi Huo looked at him and issued the invitation.

Luo Hai slowly shook his head. "No. I’ve been away long enough; it’s time to return to Cuiwei Star."

The faces of everyone from Ice Heart Valley turned ashen as they watched Chi Huo flaunt himself like the greatest victor in the world—arrogant and overbearing—yet none dared to utter a word. Even Luo Li kept her eyes tightly shut, as if preferring not to see the scene before her.

"Yang Kai, come with me!" Luo Hai glared at Yang Kai; his tone left no room for rebuttal.

Yang Kai let out a faint cold smile and didn’t spare him a glance. His gaze swept over the faces of Ice Heart Valley’s people.

Wherever his eyes landed, people averted their gaze guiltily; shame showed across their faces.

Even Ran Yunting was like that, though she quickly seemed to gather herself and said in a hard voice, "You brought this on yourselves. Don’t blame anyone but yourselves!"

Yang Kai’s cold smile deepened.

He gently tapped Su Yan’s hand. "Senior Sister, go and give these so-called elders a bow. From this moment on, you have nothing to do with them."

"Alright, I’ll do as you say." Su Yan replied obediently, then walked gracefully before Ice Heart Valley’s people and made a deep, formal bow. She lifted her head and faced Ran Yunting, saying, "This will be the last time I address you as Master. I thank you for your teachings over the years. Please take care of yourself in the future."

Ran Yunting opened her mouth as if to speak, but finally turned her head away.

Su Yan seemed to have broken free of a shackle; she returned lightly to Yang Kai’s side.

"Boy, stop resisting. You would do well to go with Brother Luo Hai. As for this little wench at your side, she is now one of Fire Radiance Sect’s," Chi Huo snorted coldly.

Yang Kai and Su Yan exchanged a look and suddenly smiled at the same time; their smiles were like the sun, dispelling the oppressive gloom within the Ice Palace.

"If you want to take Senior Sister, you must ask me first!" Yang Kai barked low.

At the same time, Su Yan’s sweet, fierce cry rose: "I live and die with my Junior Brother!"

Their auras surged; Saint Yuan erupted.

One’s Saint Yuan was vigorous and masculine; the other’s was cold and cutting as ice.

To everyone’s surprise, Yang Kai and Su Yan’s Saint Yuan seemed to resonate, trembling in unison and fusing together as they did so.

A wilder energy fluctuation flowed out, rising and falling with terrifying cadence.

Everyone’s expressions shifted; they stared, astonished, at the young pair standing side by side.

Luo Hai’s eyes flashed with sharp light, his face full of amazement as if he’d discovered something momentous. Luo Li, who had kept her eyes closed, suddenly snapped them open; a strange, intense glow flickered deep in her gaze.

Chi Huo gave a slight exclamation; the three Void King Realm experts present all showed astonishment.

Looking on, Yang Kai and Su Yan seemed to have become one. The Second Stage and First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm appeared to stack strangely and without conflict, directly surging to the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

"Interesting — a dual cultivation technique?" Luo Hai frowned. With his broad knowledge, he immediately recognized that the two of them were in perfect tacit understanding; otherwise their utterly different Saint Yuan attributes could never have combined so harmoniously — they would have clashed.

"Bastards!" Chi Huo roared.

After all, in his view Su Yan was already Wei Feng’s woman, yet she had apparently been dual-cultivating with Yang Kai at some unknown time. This was a stain on Fire Radiance Sect’s honor.

Weren’t practitioners of Ice Jade Skill supposed to be flawless? How could this scene be explained?

No sooner had Chi Huo spoken than a deafening, ear-splitting low roar sounded in the Ice Palace. That roar was singular and strange, as if it struck directly at the heart; at the instant it issued forth everyone present — even the three Void King Realm men — felt their hearts tremble.

The elders of Ice Heart Valley turned pale.

"This is…" Luo Hai shot upright, his gaze trembling as he fixed on Yang Kai, staring intently at the change within him.

A golden aura suddenly burst out from Yang Kai’s body, spiraled once over his head, and immediately took shape into a massive golden phantom.

The phantom measured over thirty zhang in length, its body gleaming with gold; its hardened scales were like the finest armor, capable of withstanding any attack.

Two eyes the size of small houses exuded endless majesty, cold and horrifying, as if standing atop the clouds and looking down on all living beings.

Meeting its gaze, everyone felt an overwhelming sense of insignificance.

"A Golden Dragon!" Luo Hai’s eyes trembled violently; his voice had changed.

He stared at the golden phantom with burning intensity, as if he were witnessing something impossible in the world.

Chi Huo stood frozen, his eyes burning like flames, his thoughts in turmoil.

He hadn’t expected Yang Kai to conceal such an astonishing treasure within himself.

Did Luo Hai follow Yang Kai to Chi Lan Star for this? No — judging by Luo Hai’s expression, he seemed to have just discovered it too.

Could this boy be hiding other secrets?

Before Chi Huo’s thoughts had finished turning, another singular sound issued forth.

This voice was not as earth-shaking as the dragon’s roar, yet it rang out brilliantly, soaring to the heavens as if it would move gods and buddhas.

With that sound, another light shot out from Yang Kai and flew to hover above Su Yan’s head, forming a pure white phantom.

The white phantom unfurled wings that echoed the golden dragon’s scale of thirty zhang; a cutting cold descended, the purest ice-borne chill in heaven and earth mobilized and gathered toward Su Yan.

Luo Li’s expression finally changed; staring at the huge phantom above Su Yan, she cried out, "Ice Phoenix!"

"What!" Luo Hai was stunned beyond composure; he could no longer maintain calm.

Golden Dragon and Ice Phoenix — both were legendary ancient divine spirits, long extinct, yet today he had seen their traces on Yang Kai.

Though not truly a Golden Dragon and Ice Phoenix, the faint primordial power radiating from those two phantoms was no counterfeit.

In other words, these two phantoms were truly the residual origins left behind upon the deaths of a Golden Dragon and an Ice Phoenix.

How many unknown treasures did this boy possess? Luo Hai looked at Yang Kai, his gaze burning.

The realms of scorching heat and severe cold spread out; Yang Kai and Su Yan stood shoulder to shoulder, their momentum overwhelming.

Golden light and white radiance shot skyward like two colossal swords cutting the world in twain; the clouds above were suddenly split into halves.

Everyone in Ice Heart Valley witnessed that marvel and stood frozen, unsure what calamity had befallen the valley.

The Ice Palace had become a ruin. When two completely opposite but mutually complementary energies erupted, the Ice Palace belonging to Ice Heart Valley collapsed with a roar; nearby wards and formations were destroyed in an instant.

More than a dozen elders of Ice Heart Valley all mobilized their techniques, straining to resist the pervasive scorching and freezing intents.

Wei Feng was sheltered behind Chi Huo.

Present among them, only three Void King Realm figures could confront such terrifying aura directly.

Ran Yunting stood stunned, staring at Su Yan with a dazed look; a deep remorse welled up in her heart.

She had told Yang Kai that Su Yan would inevitably rise and become a phoenix, that a man like Yang Kai was unworthy of her.

And now Su Yan had indeed achieved it; with the Ice Phoenix’s residual origin powering her, she could wield the phoenix’s innate talents — she had truly become a phoenix.

Yet all of this had been bestowed by Yang Kai.

The Ice Phoenix’s residual origin had clearly streamed forth from Yang Kai’s body and perfectly transferred onto Su Yan.

In this world, few things could match a phoenix; perhaps only a divine dragon could stand in equal regard.

Ran Yunting stared blankly at the enormous golden dragon phantom above Yang Kai’s head and let out a silent, wry smile—the taste in her mouth was more acrid than swallowing the most bitter of herbs.

Others in Ice Heart Valley shared the same expressions — the elders and even Luo Li.

Luo Li hadn’t expected the situation to develop this far; had she known, she would have refused Chi Huo’s outrageous demand even at the cost of great losses to Ice Heart Valley.

To possess the Ice Phoenix’s residual origin was a heaven-defying opportunity! With such origin power, any backlash from Ice Jade Skill would be trivial; Su Yan would surely lead Ice Heart Valley to glory, achieving far beyond what Luo Li could.

She was a talent the entire Sect would spill blood and give life to protect.

Yet they had treated her like a worthless pawn and pushed her away just to buy the Sect a temporary reprieve.

The light in Luo Li’s eyes suddenly dimmed; she opened her mouth and a spray of crimson blood shot forth.

She suddenly realized that she had just committed the greatest mistake of her life.
