## Chapter 764 — I Hold You in Utmost Contempt

It was still the same dim, damp dungeon; Yang Kai had been brought here and locked in another cell.

In the cell sat a lone, desolate figure, curled in a corner, her soft sobs drifting through the gloom.

Hearing the movement, she looked up toward the doorway, and in an instant her beautiful eyes lit with surprise as she cried out, "Yang Kai?"

Shouting his name, she scrambled to her feet and stumbled toward him, watching him closely; when she saw his wounds had essentially healed, astonishment flashed across her face.

Since being brought here, An Ling'er had been separated from Yang Kai; like the others, she had assumed his injuries would leave him dead or crippled, so she never expected to see him in good health again.

Yang Kai signaled to her to stay calm; after the two alien guards who had escorted him left, he pulled her into a corner of the cell.

"Are you all right?" he asked, glancing at her — her clothes were intact, but her eyes were swollen from crying.

An Ling'er shook her head. "I'm fine. They didn't mistreat me. What about you?"

"I'm fine too!" Yang Kai replied with a wry chuckle.

"Where exactly is this place? Do you know who those people were and why they captured us?"

"Not really. But they don't seem to be human, and they clearly bear a deep grudge against the demon clan." Yang Kai glanced at the adjacent cells; eyes peered curiously at him and An Ling'er, and an ominous demonic aura emanated from their bodies.

They appeared to be members of the demon clan who had been captured and imprisoned here.

"Out of the wolf's jaws and into the tiger's den," An Ling'er's face clouded; she looked gloomy.

"Don't worry; at least Grandmother Nan won't find this place anytime soon." Yang Kai sat, and compared to being hunted by that previous Saintess of the older generation, this felt far safer — at least for now he didn't fear for his life.

Hearing that, An Ling'er's spirits brightened; she sat beside him and nestled close.

Yang Kai didn't linger on her; instead he observed the demon prisoners to either side. Their True Yuan and Divine Sense appeared sealed, and in this place saturated with Yang energy their demonic qi was being partially suppressed.

There were at least a dozen demon prisoners here, of varying strength. He couldn't sense their precise cultivation levels — with the restrictions placed on his Sea of Consciousness, he dared not probe their minds with Divine Sense.

While he was watching, someone suddenly appeared outside the cell.

Yang Kai's expression tightened; his eyes narrowed as he turned toward the newcomer.

He recognized the man — the same figure who had been seated closer to the front in the main hall; he should be one of this place's experts.

The man stood outside the cell with a cold, indifferent look, staring down at Yang Kai. After a moment, several of his clansmen approached carrying various items.

"Open the cell!" the man ordered, and someone immediately unlatched the chains.

They filed in bearing a delicious scent. Yang Kai was astonished to see they had brought exquisite dishes and several flasks of fine wine.

"Boy, consider yourself lucky. The leader ordered us to take good care of you," the man snorted, and with a wave of his palm sent a strand of True Yuan into Yang Kai's body.

In the next moment Yang Kai felt the bodily seal crumble; True Yuan flowed through his meridians once more and his strength returned.

He didn't act rashly; if they so easily removed his seal, they clearly weren't afraid of him causing trouble.
The plates of food and flasks of wine were set before Yang Kai one by one, while the expert remained where he stood, looking down on him with a cold, indifferent gaze.

"What does this mean?" Yang Kai frowned. Their attitude wasn't friendly: why remove his seal and lavish such treatment on him for no reason? He felt wary.

Lavishing favors for no reason — it's either treachery or theft!

"Nothing meaningful," the man sneered as he approached, and from his palm appeared a pale yellow fruit about the size of a fist. The fruit radiated strong Yang energy and a potent fragrance the moment it manifested.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and fixed his gaze on the fruit.

"Hmph, consider this a favor — digest it well!" the man tossed the fruit to him. Yang Kai caught it and looked at him with suspicion.

The man said nothing more, turned, and departed with his clansmen, re-locking the cell behind them.

In a short while they were gone.

Yang Kai stared at the fruit and the plates of food and wine with a belly full of questions; he could not fathom what was going on.

From the cell on the left came a strange laugh: "Human boy, you're lucky — you get a last hearty meal before you die. Looks like you have a lot of use to them."

Yang Kai's brow tightened; he glanced at the speaker but the darkness concealed his face.

He rolled his eyes and chuckled, "Friends, we're all victims here. No need for mockery. Want some?"

"No need. Do what you will," the man snorted, falling silent.

"Could it be poisoned?" An Ling'er asked uneasily.

"You're overthinking it." Yang Kai shook his head. If they intended to kill him, there was no need for such theatrics — judging by their displayed strength they could have ended him outright; why bother poisoning food?

The fruit he had been given was no ordinary produce; Yang Kai didn't recognize it, but it was at least an Upper-Level Spirit-Grade fruit, saturated with Yang energy.

One such spirit fruit could fully restore a martial artist of his caliber.

"Eat, it's fine." Yang Kai smiled and handed a plate to An Ling'er.

With her True Yuan and Divine Sense sealed and still shaken from recent events, An Ling'er did need to replenish her strength; she accepted gratefully and ate slowly.

Yang Kai devoured his share like a gale, not sparing the fruit; as he consumed it, several drops of Yang liquid coalesced in his Dantian.

Over the next few days, food and wine arrived each day — finely prepared and delicious.

Yang Kai settled into the situation. In a few days his injuries healed and his strength even increased slightly. In a place so rich with Yang energy, practicing the True Yang Technique was a godsend.

Whenever he and An Ling'er received such treatment, the demon prisoners in the neighboring cells felt sour and ill at ease.

They couldn't understand why Yang Kai, as a fellow prisoner, enjoyed such privileged treatment while they suffered.

The demon who had mocked him earlier had expected Yang Kai to be killed quickly, but after these days of favors instead of trouble, he found the situation baffling.

About five days later, while Yang Kai sat meditating, he sensed the Yang energy in the air fluctuate — as if the source of that energy had been disturbed.

He furrowed his brow and probed carefully, but couldn't glean any useful information.

The demon prisoners to either side, however, noticeably changed expression when they felt it; one by one they fell silent, their unease and agitation spreading as if disaster were imminent.

"What's wrong with them?" An Ling'er whispered, shrinking closer to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai only shook his head, his face grave.

A creak sounded and hurried footsteps approached as several people rushed in. At the same moment the demon prisoners began to curse and howl, their emotions wildly excited and combative.

But their seals and confinement left them powerless; after a chaotic scuffle several demons were dragged away.

With a clang the cell doors were slammed and locked again.

The remaining prisoners continued to shout curses that went unanswered.

"Enough! Shut up — does yelling help?" the demon from the left cell who had spoken to Yang Kai before shouted angrily.

Silence fell over all of them.

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise; this demon clearly held some standing among them, or else the others wouldn't so readily obey.

After about the time it takes a stick of incense to burn, the chaotic energy fluctuations subsided and the air calmed.

A mood of shared, sympathetic sorrow swept through the demon prisoners; every one of them fell into sombre, disheartened silence.

Yang Kai's eyes flickered. He suspected they likely knew more than he did, and perhaps he could get some information or leads about this place from them.

The next day, food and wine were brought again. This time Yang Kai carried a flask to the left and called across, "Friend, want a drink? The wine's decent."

In the darkness a pair of eyes opened, flashing with murderous light. A cold laugh came from the other cell, laced with scorn and derision.

"Though I'm human and you're a demon, and humans and demons are rarely on good terms, there's a saying: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. What do you think?" Yang Kai said with a genial air.

The demon's smile faded; he thought for a moment, then sneered, "Hmph, you humans are deceitful, but you know how to adapt!"

He rose, moved to the space between the two cells, sat cross-legged, snatched Yang Kai's flask, and drank greedily.

In a few breaths the demon drained the first flask; Yang Kai handed him another.

Pleased by his composure, the demon nodded and spat disdainfully, "I despise you humans most of all: bowing before the mighty, tyrannizing the weak — treacherous and crafty!"

"Heh." Yang Kai merely smiled. "Drink first; we'll talk after."
