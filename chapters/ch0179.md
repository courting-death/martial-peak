## Chapter 179 — The Great Movements of Yunxia Sect

Returning to the grand courtyard of Yunxia Sect, Yang Kai felt a heavy weight in his heart.

Had he not encountered the lady, he would have been scheming to steal a boat and leave this place. But now, he had no desire to depart.

Since Yunxia Sect had acquired the entire turtle shell, they would undoubtedly take action.

The map they obtained was merely an outer map; the most crucial part was in his possession. Yang Kai felt he could not waste the lady's efforts. She had mustered the courage to let him memorize the map, not for him to bury it away.

If his conjectures were correct, Yunxia Sect would surely take action in the coming days or within a month.

Yang Kai pondered many things and formed his own speculations.

Miao Huacheng had obtained the complete turtle shell, and the reason he still offered it to Yunxia Sect was likely twofold: on one hand, it was for his son's future, and on the other, it was because the Miao Family lacked the strength to explore that mysterious island.

Thus, he borrowed the flower to present to the Buddha, hoping to gain favor with Yunxia Sect and create a future for Miao Lin.

The internal map of the island he possessed was sufficient to help him avoid most risks and reach the most critical location. What secrets lay hidden on that mysterious island, Yang Kai did not know, but it was certainly worth the risk.

The only problem now was how he could stealthily act alongside Yunxia Sect. They held the map to find the mysterious island; without joining them, he would never reach that place.

For several consecutive nights, Yang Kai frequently ventured out to gather information. From the casual chatter of some disciples, he learned that the higher-ups of Yunxia Sect had indeed obtained a mysterious sea map recently and were busily preparing to set out for exploration.

These ordinary disciples did not know much; they merely caught snippets from the conversations of the higher-ups, and the specifics were unclear to them.

As Yang Kai struggled to think of how to safely infiltrate Yunxia Sect's exploration team, one morning, the courtyard echoed with the shouts of Yunxia Sect disciples. Soon, all the captured commoners were gathered together.

These people looked terrified, with some murmuring, “Are we going to collect herbs again? We just returned a few days ago. Wasn't it once a month for herb collection?”

“Heh heh, this time it’s not for herb collection. As for what we’re doing, you don’t need to ask too much; just get on the ship like usual,” a Yunxia Sect disciple replied with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

Yang Kai listened intently, his heart stirring. After much contemplation, he suddenly realized.

If his guess was correct, then this time... it was indeed an opportunity!

He made his way to the seaside as usual. At that moment, a ship larger than any he had seen before was docked by the shore. The ship was over twenty zhang long, with five masts. The sails fluttered in the wind, and the bow rose high like a dragon's head, exuding an imposing aura.

Many had never seen such a large ship in their lives, and they were momentarily stunned.

“Heavens, this is Yunxia Sect's largest dragon ship! Where are they taking us?” someone with knowledge murmured.

Yang Kai felt increasingly certain about his suspicions.

He never expected that after all his efforts to figure out how to blend into Yunxia Sect's exploration team, they would take the initiative to bring him along.

Yunxia Sect's intention in bringing these commoners aboard was not to have them explore treasures but to have them work on the large ship. Operating such a massive vessel would certainly require a considerable number of hands.

With this thought, Yang Kai's expression calmed.

Since this was Yunxia Sect's exploration ship, there would undoubtedly be experts aboard! Experts even more formidable than those in the True Yuan Realm, specifically those in the Divine Roaming Realm!

He could hide from True Yuan Realm warriors, but if a Divine Roaming Realm expert took an interest and used their Divine Sense to probe him, he would immediately reveal his true form. Thus, he had to be extremely cautious on this journey, ensuring he did not expose any flaws; otherwise, he would surely meet a tragic end.

Following the crowd, Yang Kai was ushered onto the ship by the Yunxia Sect warriors, along with nearly seventy commoners. Under the arrangement of those warriors, they were assigned various tasks.

Yang Kai was fortunate; he was not assigned to the lower deck to row but was instead tasked with miscellaneous duties, which meant he had to do a bit of everything.

This suited Yang Kai's intentions perfectly. Although hiding below deck to row was safer, he preferred to stay on the deck to gather various pieces of information, as long as he remained cautious and did not attract the attention of Divine Roaming Realm experts.

After waiting for a while, a group of people from Yunxia Sect arrived, led by two elderly individuals, both in their twilight years, with rosy faces and white hair, their eyes sparkling with authority. These two were undoubtedly the top experts of Yunxia Sect.

One was an old man, and the other an old woman, both chatting and laughing as they approached.

A middle-aged man already on the ship quickly called out respectfully, “Welcome, esteemed uncles!”

At this call, the disciples of Yunxia Sect on the ship hurriedly echoed their greetings.

The old man and woman smiled slightly, gracefully floating onto the ship. After surveying their surroundings, the old woman asked, “Is everything ready?”

The middle-aged man replied respectfully, “Everything is ready. We are just waiting for the two esteemed uncles to arrive before we can set sail!”

“Hmm.” The old man nodded and waved his hand, saying, “You go arrange things. Lan Shishu and I will be in the cabin meditating. Unless it’s something important, do not disturb us.”

“Yes!”

Once the two Divine Roaming Realm elders stepped into the cabin, Yang Kai could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.

The middle-aged man held a significant position in Yunxia Sect, overseeing the arrangements for the warriors boarding the ship.

After a half-hour of busywork, at his command, the large ship slowly began to move.

Yang Kai stood on the deck, pretending to work while quietly memorizing the ship's course.

The ship sailed through the winds and waves, capable of traveling a thousand li in a day and night. Gradually, there were no islands in sight, only the boundless ocean.

As the sun set and the moon rose, Yang Kai spent three days on the ship, diligently performing his duties while gathering information from the casual conversations of the boarding warriors.

This ship, carrying so many people, was indeed headed to explore that mysterious island.

However, the Yunxia Sect warriors referred to that mysterious island as the Hidden Island! This term suddenly reminded Yang Kai of many strange tales he had heard in Haicheng.

The Hidden Island was one such tale; it was said that the scenes appearing in mirages were not illusions. Somewhere deep in the ocean, there existed a real place, but for some unknown reason, these scenes spread thousands of li away, imprinting themselves in the eyes of the residents of Haicheng.

The places appearing in the mirages could not be reached by ordinary means; only by holding an island guide could one enter when approaching.

These islands, which could not be easily approached or seen, were called Hidden Islands!

On the Hidden Island, there were treasures that could rival nations, martial arts techniques that could propel one to great heights, and countless rare treasures.

Everyone wished to set foot on the Hidden Island but had always struggled to find a way. Yet now, this opportunity had fallen into the hands of Yunxia Sect, which was why they dispatched their elite, even sending two Divine Roaming Realm experts, to explore the Hidden Island.

Yunxia Sect had only four Divine Roaming Realm experts in total, and now half of them were departing, showcasing the sect's determination.

Over the past few days, the most talked-about topic among the Yunxia Sect warriors was their yearning for that mysterious Hidden Island, fantasizing about the opportunities and adventures they might encounter there.

This led Yang Kai to think of the Inheritance Celestial Cave, and he awakened Di Mo, who had been in seclusion, to inquire. He learned that the Hidden Island was likely not the Inheritance Celestial Cave; it might be that a significant figure occupied an island for cultivation but did not wish to be disturbed by outsiders, thus setting up some formation to make the island disappear from the eyes of the world.

Or perhaps this Hidden Island possessed natural formations that ordinary people could not see.

Regardless, there were indeed opportunities on the Hidden Island.

Through the casual chatter of the Yunxia Sect disciples, Yang Kai also memorized many names and strengths of experts. The middle-aged man was named Yu Xiuping, possessing the strength of the ninth layer of the True Yuan Realm, and was an elder of Yunxia Sect.

For someone in the True Yuan Realm to hold the position of elder, it was clear that Yunxia Sect was not inferior to Lingxiao Pavilion. Moreover, their Divine Roaming Realm experts were all quite aged; although the elders of Lingxiao Pavilion were also old, they were undoubtedly younger than those two uncles.

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts who boarded the ship were named Ding Jiazi, at the fifth layer of the Divine Roaming Realm, and Huo Xianglan, at the fourth layer. Both were supreme elders of Yunxia Sect, usually meditating and secluding themselves within the sect. Given their advanced age, they would not have appeared unless the matter was of great importance.

One day, while Yang Kai was quietly cleaning the deck, he suddenly heard someone speaking nearby: “Qing'er, why are you alone here? Is Miao Lin not accompanying you?”

Upon hearing the name Miao Lin, Yang Kai's ears perked up.

He remembered that the lady from the Jiang Family had mentioned that Miao Huacheng's son was named Miao Lin! The calamity that befell the Jiang Family was partly instigated by him!

Could it be the same person? Yang Kai became attentive, continuing his actions while deliberately moving closer to the speaker, subtly glancing over.

By the ship's railing stood a beautiful young woman, enjoying the sea breeze. She wore a light blue long dress, and the wind clung to her dress, outlining her alluring curves. She appeared to be around twenty years old, with a graceful figure, a slender waist, and long legs. Her skin was not the typical sun-kissed hue of those by the sea but was as fair as mutton fat jade, delicate and flawless.

However, the expression on her face was somewhat haughty, with a hint of superiority in her gaze.

Beside her stood a middle-aged man, who was none other than the Yunxia Sect elder Yu Xiuping!

It turned out that this woman was his daughter, Yu Aoqing! Yang Kai understood in his heart.

He had heard the name Yu Aoqing many times over the past few days; many young disciples of Yunxia Sect had been discussing her in private. Just as Su Yan held a prominent position in Lingxiao Pavilion, Yu Aoqing was the object of admiration for many young talents in Yunxia Sect.
