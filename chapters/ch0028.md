## Chapter 28 — Too Stingy

Facing Li Yuntian’s inquiry, Yang Kai remained silent.

Li Yuntian thought he had guessed correctly and smiled, “Rest assured, Senior Brother. Our strength should be about equal; who wins or loses is still uncertain. If Junior Brother is truly lucky enough to win, then I will compensate for any losses you suffer.”

“Is that a promise?” Yang Kai asked with some surprise.

“A gentleman’s word is as binding as four horses cannot chase it back!” Li Yuntian replied solemnly.

Originally, Li Yuntian thought he had successfully fooled Yang Kai and was ready to show off his skills. He knew Su Mu Ding was hiding nearby, watching secretly. If he could teach Yang Kai a harsh lesson and avenge Su Shao, his reputation would soar.

But unexpectedly, Yang Kai frowned again. Li Yuntian nearly cursed in frustration. This Senior Brother was so fussy and annoying, like a woman. How could Zhao Hu have lost to such a person?

“Senior Brother, is there anything else?” Li Yuntian felt on the verge of exploding.

“Hmm, although I want to spar with you, I was challenged yesterday. If I fight again now, I’ll need to wait a few days,” Yang Kai replied.

What a fool! Li Yuntian nearly lost his breath in one gulp and hurriedly said, “Senior Brother, you can challenge me. I haven’t been challenged these past few days. Every day, disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion have one chance to challenge others, don’t they?”

“I see!” Yang Kai suddenly understood and gave a dry laugh. “Junior Brother, please don’t blame me. I have never challenged anyone these years and had completely forgotten this rule.”

Li Yuntian slowly exhaled, as if trying to breathe out his anger and frustration. After a long moment, he said, “Senior Brother, can we spar now?”

Yang Kai had another question. “Junior Brother, if I lose, will you really compensate me with Contribution Points?”

“Absolutely! Tenfold compensation!” Li Yuntian said through gritted teeth.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I don’t believe you, unless you give me the Contribution Points first.”

“How can I give you that?” Li Yuntian was annoyed. Contribution Points were recorded at the accounting office and couldn’t be carried around or traded. Being a Senior Brother was too petty—did he really think he would renege on such a matter?

“I do have an idea,” Yang Kai said with a sly smile, beckoning Li Yuntian over and whispering a few words into his ear.

Li Yuntian’s expression changed several times. He had to admit Yang Kai’s mind was truly sharp, coming up with such a plan.

“If Junior Brother finds it difficult, then forget it. It’s not that I don’t trust you as a Senior Brother, but…” Yang Kai played a subtle game of advance and retreat, hesitating.

Li Yuntian knew exactly what he meant. Though disdainful, he could only endure for the sake of his plan. “No matter, Senior Brother, wait here. I’ll go get it quickly. Wait for me, I’ll be fast.”

With that, he hurried away.

Watching his retreating figure, Yang Kai felt many emotions. In this world, there were still people who came begging to be beaten, and if refused, even offered gifts. Strange indeed. But this was good—it solved his immediate problem. Unfortunately, this trick could only be used once; next time, it would no longer work.

For a moment, Yang Kai felt regret. Had he known earlier, he would have lion-heartedly demanded more and given Li Yuntian a harsh beating. Judging by Li Yuntian’s eagerness, he probably would have agreed to even more excessive demands.

Su Mu, along with a group, hid nearby. They were pleased to see Li Yuntian and Yang Kai talking, ready to watch the show with wide eyes. But unexpectedly, Li Yuntian suddenly ran off in a hurry. This left Su Mu utterly confused.

The plan from last night didn’t include this! What was Li Yuntian up to?

Su Mu was puzzled and quickly sent someone to intercept Li Yuntian to inquire about the situation.

After fifteen minutes, the messenger returned and whispered to Su Mu, “Young Master Su, Li Yuntian said that Yang Kai is too petty. He insists that Yang Kai first exchange for ten herbs at the Contribution Hall to compensate for his losses before agreeing to spar.”

“That’s too stingy!” Su Mu was dumbfounded. “Yang Kai is only a Trial Disciple. Losing would only cost some Contribution Points. Why demand ten herbs as compensation?”

The messenger replied, “Li Yuntian himself boasted he would compensate tenfold, so…”

“Hmph, serves him right,” Su Mu said with a strange expression. “But never mind, as long as we can teach Yang Kai a lesson, ten herbs are nothing.”

Ten herbs would probably cost only ten Contribution Points, which Su Mu didn’t take seriously.

The group, knowing the situation, could only wait patiently without making a move.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai had almost finished sweeping the area. Li Yuntian returned, drenched in sweat. It wasn’t because the Contribution Hall was far, but because the old shopkeeper Meng was still asleep. Li Yuntian had knocked on the door for a long time before waking him.

Meng’s temper was naturally bad after being disturbed from a pleasant dream. Li Yuntian didn’t get to scold Yang Kai but was instead scolded by Meng. The ten Lower-Level Common-Grade herbs cost a full twenty Contribution Points to exchange.

Li Yuntian was furious inside and vowed to recover his losses with interest from Yang Kai later.

At the agreed place, Yang Kai was indeed still there, broom in hand, standing patiently.

Li Yuntian hurried over in three quick steps, panting, and thrust the ten herbs into Yang Kai’s hand, grumbling, “Here, Senior Brother, take these.”

“Heh, no need,” Yang Kai said generously, taking them without even looking and placing both broom and herbs on the ground.

“Senior Brother, can we spar now?” Li Yuntian asked.

“Yes, yes, no need for such trouble. Junior Brother’s word is enough; Senior Brother trusts you,” Yang Kai said with a cheerful smile.

Li Yuntian was so angry he felt as if he had reached enlightenment, ascended, and transcended all at once. He was the one who demanded the herbs, yet now he was the one talking about trust. All the good and bad words were said by Yang Kai alone. He had been busy all morning without eating, was it all for nothing?

But never mind. Li Yuntian caught his breath and steadied himself. Now that half the goal was achieved, if Yang Kai dared to challenge him, he would show no mercy.

“Then, Junior Brother, shall we begin?” Yang Kai asked for Li Yuntian’s opinion.

“Good,” Li Yuntian’s spirit lifted. He cupped his fists and said, “Please instruct me, Senior Brother!”

“Not at all!” Yang Kai smiled.

Neither revealed their current realm. Li Yuntian feared scaring Yang Kai off, and Yang Kai was happy to keep it that way. With mutual understanding, the challenge began.

With Zhao Hu’s defeat as a warning and his own pent-up resentment, Li Yuntian held nothing back. He prepared to strike with thunderous force.

In a flash of lightning and thunder, with a voice as deep as an abyss, the two clashed. Li Yuntian, filled with anger, unleashed his full strength. His palms flew up and down, each strike faster and heavier than the last.

Yang Kai remained calm. His lean body tensed, the results of recent training manifesting. He responded with Lingxiao Pavilion’s foundational techniques: Long Fist and Whip Kick.

Fists and palms collided. Li Yuntian was shocked. A powerful force struck him, shaking his footing. He stumbled back several steps. Moreover, his palm felt as if it had struck a rock, the rebound numbing his bones.
