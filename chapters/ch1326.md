## Chapter 1326 — Incident

Among the Five Elements, water and fire no longer give him any trouble; besides those, he also possessed a Thundertree, a treasure belonging to the wood element.

This Thundertree was obtained by Yang Kai before he came to Dark Star. It was formed from the condensed flesh-and-blood essence of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast, the Thunder Luan, after it died. In terms of value it was no worse than the Inner Core of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast—perhaps even superior.

Only the final two treasures of metal and earth remained unclear to Yang Kai.

But he was in no rush; even if he were to assemble all five elemental treasures now, he still wouldn't have much time or energy to cultivate. There were too many things demanding his attention: refining the Space Blade and the Golden Blood Threads secret technique, tempering the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl, and finding a way to melt down that Glazed Pearl.

Especially the Golden Blood Threads technique—upon learning it could dispel Shi, Yang Kai's estimation of it rose another level. The Demon Blood Sect's secret technique truly lived up to being their founding legacy; it had some unique aspects.

At present he had only formed a single Golden Blood Thread and it was not yet perfected; how long it would take to form more was uncertain. For these reasons, although Yang Kai coveted the Undying Five Elements Sword greatly, he would not immediately begin cultivating it; at the very least he'd wait until he had gathered all five elemental treasures before making a plan.

That said, studying it in advance wouldn't hurt—becoming familiar with its principles now would make subsequent cultivation far more efficient.

With that decided, Yang Kai temporarily stowed the Undying Five Elements Sword in his Spatial Ring, sorted his thoughts, and began absorbing the soul energy left behind by Elder Wang to peer into the Martial Dao belonging to him.

He treated it with utmost caution, devouring it little by little and not wanting to miss a single scrap.

Three days later, Elder Wang's soul energy was exhausted. Yang Kai opened his eyes, wearing an expression of some contemplation.

Although Elder Wang's cultivation wasn't very high, having dwelt for years at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, he had developed his own unique insights into Shi. Much of those insights had now become Yang Kai's wealth; by devouring him Yang Kai had gained a bit more clarity on what true Shi really was.

Understanding it was one thing; to actually cultivate it was another. He would need his own cultivation to reach that level before he could truly begin training. Still, if he encountered another Origin Returning Realm expert in the future, Yang Kai could use his newfound understanding of Shi to craft targeted measures—so it was not without benefit.

He believed that by killing more Origin Returning Realm foes he would deepen his comprehension of Shi step by step; accumulation would eventually lead to towers of insight, and reaching an unsurpassed mastery was not impossible.

A warrior's path of advancement required that only when an Origin Returning Realm practitioner perfected their Shi to a consummate state would there be a chance to break through to the Void King Realm, and across Dark Star such practitioners were practically nonexistent—hence why no Void King Realm experts appeared on Dark Star.

The laws of Dark Star suppressed Origin Returning Realm practitioners’ grasp of Shi. Yang Kai had not yet reached that stage, but he could not remain trapped on Dark Star forever. If one day he truly reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, he would in any case leave this place, escape its law-bound shroud, and go elsewhere to achieve the Void King Realm.

Thinking about that now was premature. Yang Kai withdrew his will, took out the Glazed Pearl that Daiyuan had given him, placed it in his palm, silently circulated his profound arts, poured in Saint Yuan, and began to refine it.

No sooner had he begun than Yang Kai's expression changed, then brightened with surprise; he promptly increased his Saint Yuan output. Nearly imperceptibly, the glazed radiance within the Glazed Pearl crept into his body, and at Yang Kai's guided effort it converged at his left eye.

A Glazed Pearl was comparable to a demonic beast's Inner Core. Yang Kai had simply thought that absorbing the Inner Core's energy could be done directly like this, so he tried it—and unexpectedly it actually worked, and with remarkable ease.

This filled him with ecstatic joy.

He held his breath and focused on absorption, while simultaneously continuing to cultivate the Golden Blood Thread already within his body.

Time flashed by, and two months passed.

On that day Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, looked at his empty hands, and frowned slightly.

After two months of absorption, the Glazed Pearl Daiyuan had given him was finally consumed down to nothing. Although he had absorbed the glazed radiance into his body, complete refinement still required more time. Now, suspended beside the World-Ending Demon Eye floating in his Sea of Consciousness, there hung a layer of resplendent radiance—the Glazed Light that had been contained within the Glazed Pearl.

But Yang Kai felt the fusion between it and the World-Ending Demon Eye was progressing rather slowly—somewhat different from his expectations—which left him a little annoyed.

In his prior estimate the World-Ending Demon Eye and the Glazed Light were similar in nature and should have fused easily; as it turned out, he had been too naive.

Still, this outcome was within his range of possibilities—given enough time the Glazed Light could merge with the World-Ending Demon Eye; it was merely a matter of duration.

Putting that aside for the moment, Yang Kai flicked his hand and two golden threads appeared.

One shone with dazzling gold and was razor-sharp, seeming able to slice through space itself; its power was unmatched. The other was clearly inferior: its color was dull, and the power contained within could not compare to the first.

That inferior thread was the second Golden Blood Thread Yang Kai had cultivated.

When Demon Blood Sect disciples cultivate this secret technique, even devoting their life’s energy they may not manage to form two threads. The foundation for the technique is one's qi and blood; each person's qi-and-blood power is limited, and overuse shortens life. Within the Demon Blood Sect only a handful of elder figures who had reached the Second or Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could form two or three threads—those below the Origin Returning Realm had only one.

Even so, those elders had to scour the world for spirit-grade pills and medicines to nourish their qi and blood before producing multiple threads; otherwise, if their qi and blood were too depleted, they might die.

Yang Kai was different. He carried dozens of drops of Golden Blood—one drop could transform into a Golden Blood Thread, and Golden Blood could be replenished. Theoretically he could cultivate innumerable threads; this secret technique was practically tailor-made for him.

Over a month ago he had felt his first thread had reached its limit.

It wasn't that the thread itself could be further tempered; rather, he had only received the upper half of the Demon Blood Threads secret technique. How to further temper the thread to make it stronger was unknown to him.

Left with no choice, Yang Kai had chosen to cultivate a second thread.

With prior experience, the second thread formed much faster than the first, and he believed it would soon possess power comparable to the first.

After forming the second thread, Yang Kai felt a faint enlightenment.

He suspected the technique was not as simple as he had imagined. If he had enough threads, perhaps they could combine to form other transformations. But none of this was mentioned in the upper half of the Demon Blood Threads technique; Yang Kai guessed such secrets were hidden in the lower half!

The golden threads had reached their current limit and could no longer be refined further. As for the transformation and combination techniques Yang Kai had speculated about, he had no idea how to proceed. It seemed that, given the chance in the future, he would truly have to make a trip to the Demon Blood Sect and obtain the lower half of the Demon Blood Threads secret art — only then could he advance further along this path.

This period of secluded cultivation had been very fruitful; Yang Kai did the math and decided it was time to emerge.

He recalled that Yang Yan had said last time that in her current plan there were places where she might need Yang Kai's strength—he wasn't sure if that was still the case. Since he had been in seclusion she certainly would not dare to interrupt him.

Deciding that, Yang Kai checked the Red Candle Fruit. He confirmed that the flesh of that petal had not withered under the nurturing of the Red Candle Base, then dispelled the stone residence's sealing formation and stepped outside.

The Spiritual Qi within Dragon Lair Mountain seemed to have thickened since before; it was richer than it had been. The residents here were not numerous and their cultivations varied, so consumption was small, which allowed the mountain’s Spiritual Qi to become denser—unlike a major sect where thousands of disciples would only keep the balance even with a superior earth vein supplying Spiritual Qi.

The surroundings were quiet. Looking around Yang Kai did not see a single person, which did not surprise him. He released his Divine Sense and quickly located Yang Yan and the others.

What puzzled him was that all those in Dragon Lair Mountain with any say in matters had gathered together in one place, as if to deliberate something important.

Smiling slightly, Yang Kai strolled toward the bamboo building where they had convened. Before he reached it he could hear Hao An's voice from afar: "This is outrageous—they're raising the price on us! How could this happen?"

Chang Qi's comforting voice followed: "Enough, Old Hao, sit and speak calmly. The young ones can keep their composure; why are you getting so worked up?"

"Elder Chang, what do you think of this matter?" Wu Yi asked as though inquiring for counsel.

“Heh, I find this whole thing a bit strange!” Chang Qi replied with a cold smile. “We’ve been cooperating with Yingyue Hall for more than just a day or two. Over the past two years, the goods we’ve purchased from them may not be countless, but the total value has reached at least two hundred million Saint Crystals. They’ve always dealt with us honestly and fairly — yet this time, the material prices suddenly went up. That’s really quite suspicious.”

"Not only that, they've even detained Yu Feng—that's abnormal," Hao An chimed in more calmly from the side.

"And I've noticed something else odd," Wu Yi said, watching thoughtfully.

"What is it?"

"Since three months ago, many of the shopkeepers and attendants in Tianyun City who belonged to Yingyue Hall seem to have been replaced. The familiar faces are gone; I can't even find Luo Qing anymore."

Inside the bamboo building the gathered people exchanged worried looks and suddenly realized something must have happened within Yingyue Hall.
