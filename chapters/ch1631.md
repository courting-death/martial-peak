## Chapter 1631 — Chance Encounter

“That’s better.” Yang Kai smiled faintly, then after a moment’s thought said, “There’s no harm in telling you—if I wished, I could crush everyone aboard this ship into dust with a mere flick of my hand. The strongest one here, that old fellow, is only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. But I am merciful by nature and disinclined to act so ruthlessly. I suggest you think more carefully for the sake of your kin and friends—if you truly provoke me, the consequences will be more than you can bear.”

The girl's beautiful eyes widened, and she nodded frantically.

Yang Kai casually spoke the cultivation level of the strongest on the boat, which made the girl realize this youth might truly be terrifying.

Of course she no longer dared to joke with her own life or the lives of her clansmen.

Yang Kai released her; indeed, the girl stopped screaming and stood there trembling with fear, staring at him without a word.

"Mm, don't be afraid. Although I am not exactly a good man, I'm not a villain either. If you behave, there will be benefits for you," Yang Kai comforted.

The girl was actually quite bold; after the initial fright and terror subsided, seeing Yang Kai's pleasant demeanor she calmed considerably, though she still dared not speak and only stood there uneasily.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and carefully scanned the surrounding area, faintly guessing why he had appeared here.

At that time he had hidden the Xuan Realm Pearl beneath the bottom of a river, and now it seemed the Xuan Realm Pearl had been obtained unintentionally by this girl.

Exactly how she had obtained it, however, he did not know.

Her cultivation was only at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, not even entering the Saint ranks; she had a slender, delicate figure and a fair, delicate face.

"What place is this, and who are you people?" Yang Kai reined in his mind, found a chair to sit on, and looked at the girl as he asked.

The girl swallowed and suppressed her fear, answering in a trembling voice, "In response to elder: this is Thorn Lake, and we are people of the Wang Family."

Thorn Lake, the Wang Family! Yang Kai had never heard of them; he guessed they were a small family on this Cultivation Star.

He did not pay it much mind. Now that he had emerged from the Xuan Realm Pearl, his primary task was to find out whether Luo Hai was still on Chi Lan Star.

Although he felt it had been more than a year and that Luo Hai probably would not continue searching for him, caution was never wrong, and he dared not be too conspicuous. That was why he had pressed the girl, hoping to glean some news from her.

It was unlikely she knew much. But Luo Hai was, after all, a Void King Realm expert at the Second Stage; his every move could attract attention. If by chance this girl knew something...?

"Mm. What's the name of this Cultivation Star?" Yang Kai asked again.

"Chi Lan Star!" the girl said, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment, curiosity shining in her beautiful eyes.

"Chi Lan Star?" Yang Kai frowned and immediately recalled that he had dealt with many fighters from Chi Lan Star. Not to mention people from the Fire Radiance Sect and Ice Heart Valley, there was Xu Dingyang whom he had run into in the Blood Prison — he seemed to be from Chi Lan Star.

Before he died, Xu Dingyang had entrusted Yang Kai to visit Qingyu Sect and inform them of his death.

He had not expected to stumble, by accident, onto this Cultivation Star.

"Is there a Fire Radiance Sect and an Ice Heart Valley here?"

"Yes." The girl nodded. "The Fire Radiance Sect and Ice Heart Valley are the two most powerful sects on Chi Lan Star; both have Void King Realm experts stationed as guardians."

After answering a few of Yang Kai's questions, the girl's emotions calmed considerably and her courage increased; she took the initiative to come forward and poured a cup of water for Yang Kai.

She could also see that Yang Kai did not truly seem like a villain.

"Void King Realm experts stationed?" Yang Kai was surprised. He did not have deep knowledge of these two great sects, but from the strength of those he had met, it was only natural they would have fighters of that level.

"Is there a sect called Qingyu Sect?" Yang Kai asked.

The girl's beautiful eyes brightened for an instant. "Do you have ties with Qingyu Sect, elder?"

"Not exactly — just answer my question!"

The girl's expression changed; she hurriedly nodded. "Yes. Our Wang Family is a clan affiliated under Qingyu Sect."

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "Is that so?"

"I would not dare lie." The girl bit her red lips.

"Then tell me, what is the name of Qingyu Sect's sect leader?"

"Xu Dingyang, Sect Leader Xu!"

Yang Kai nodded lightly; he read her expression and found her gaze pure, without any sign of deceit, confirming she was not lying. Thinking for a moment, he took out a Spatial Ring and handed it to the girl.

"Elder, this is..."

"Your Qingyu Sect's sect leader died in the Blood Prison; this is his Spatial Ring. I only met him once — before he died he asked that if I had the chance to come to Chi Lan Star, I should report his death to Qingyu Sect. Now that I've seen you, that task is yours. Take this Spatial Ring to Qingyu Sect — they will confirm it over there."

"The sect leader is dead?" The girl was stunned.

From her perspective, the Qingyu Sect's sect leader's cultivation was godlike, an amount of power she could never hope to attain in her lifetime, yet such a mighty figure had actually died.

The girl could not help but go blank.

Yang Kai gave her a moment to digest the news before asking, "What is your name?"

"I am Wang Ying, junior disciple Wang Ying!"

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded. "Wang Ying, has anything major happened on Chi Lan Star recently? Has anyone important come here?"

"Important people?" Wang Ying looked puzzled, shook her head, and said, "I am not sure, but if you mean major events, there is indeed one."

"Tell me about it."

Wang Ying then related the news that both the Fire Radiance Sect and Ice Heart Valley were searching for a person.

Although Wang Ying did not know what the sought person looked like, she had heard people say he was a youth of about twenty or thirty years of age.

Yang Kai instantly sensed something was amiss.

Could it be him? And from the timing, it fit with events that occurred after he had arrived on Chi Lan Star.

Yang Kai could understand why the Fire Radiance Sect was searching for him; while imprisoned in the Blood Prison he had overheard that Fire Radiance Sect's Supreme Elder had some acquaintance with Luo Hai, and if Luo Hai remained on Chi Lan Star he would surely ask Fire Radiance Sect to help search.

But why was Ice Heart Valley also looking for him?

He had had dealings with people from Ice Heart Valley before, but that had been in the Imperial Garden. He had no grievance with Ice Heart Valley — why would they look for him?

The matters of the Imperial Treasure and the Void Mind Crystal would never have been leaked; Luo Hai's aim was precisely those two items — he would not allow others to interfere.

Yang Kai pondered and could not fathom the reasoning.

"Elder..." Wang Ying, seeing Yang Kai lost in thought, could not help but call softly.

"Your answer pleases me. This is for you." Yang Kai casually tossed a package onto the table, then rose and, with a slight shimmer, vanished from the room.

Wang Ying had not seen how he had disappeared.

She stood there stunned for a long while before drawing breath in great gasps; a sense of having narrowly escaped death washed over her.

Slowly she stepped forward to the table and opened the package. Her beautiful eyes brightened abruptly.

Inside the package were exquisite jade bottles, at least twenty of them, each filled with spiritual pills and other miraculous medicines.

......

No one noticed Yang Kai leave the iron boat. Once off the boat, he casually picked a direction and flew forward.

Chi Lan Star was not safe; Luo Hai had even used another's hand to search for his whereabouts. Yang Kai wanted to leave the place quickly, for if Luo Hai discovered his trail it would spell another trouble.

Now that his control over Spatial Force had grown ever finer, he did not worry about dying at Luo Hai's hands, yet being pursued by such a powerful expert was hardly pleasant.

How to leave safely was the pressing issue.

A Void King Realm expert's Divine Sense was astonishing. Who knew whether Luo Hai and Fire Radiance Sect were monitoring cultivators leaving Chi Lan Star? If discovered, it would be walking into a trap — it might be safer to mingle within Chi Lan Star for the time being.

With a grave expression, Yang Kai let his mind drift in myriad thoughts as he flew.

This was the first time in his life he had been hunted by a Void King Realm expert, and moreover one at the Star Lord level.

The pressure was truly like a mountain!

Chi Lan Star was now filled with turbulence; though the Fire Radiance Sect and Ice Heart Valley had long been at odds and often clashed, never before had the two been so sharply opposed as in recent times.

The sects and families affiliated under the two great forces had all been mobilized.

Across virtually all of Chi Lan Star, battles could be seen; every day cultivators died.

Yang Kai flew on, witnessing countless skirmishes: small two-person duels, and large melees of hundreds or even over a thousand fighting — the scenes were wildly chaotic.

One day, as he flew high above, a clamorous uproar rose from below.

Yang Kai looked down and saw at least six hundred people gathered below, divided into two camps in fierce combat.

It was, needless to say, a clash between Fire Radiance Sect and Ice Heart Valley; cultivators on both sides fell, blood stained the earth, and the brilliance of secret treasures and secret techniques dazzled the eye.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly and swept past from above.

Flying several dozen li farther, he still felt the tremor of conflict from below.

Only this time it was a contest among three people, seemingly separated from that larger battlefield.

Two men were ganging up on a woman; none of their cultivations were particularly high, while the woman herself was at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, and the two men were the same.

With equal realms, numbers held the advantage. The woman surged left and right but could not shake free of their ambush. The two men, though wary of the woman's methods, did not press too hard and instead fought to exhaust her Saint Yuan.

The woman wore white and exuded an icy chill, while the two men practiced fire-based methods, their bodies seeming to burn with blazing flame, easily dispelling her cold and taunting her to disturb her mind.

With opposing elemental affinities, the woman's situation was extremely dire.

As Yang Kai swept past overhead, he frowned and cast a glance below.

The woman's profile entered his sight, and Yang Kai, flying at speed, suddenly halted in midair, his eyelids contracting as he stared at her, as if he had discovered something extraordinary.

The woman moved with lightness, weaving and evading, her hair streaming; from time to time her front was presented toward Yang Kai.

"It is her!" Yang Kai's body trembled and a startling light flashed in his eyes.

He had never expected to encounter this woman on Chi Lan Star!
