## Chapter 506 — Really Just a Second-Rate Sect?

The two of them slowly awoke, still tightly entwined from the waist down, the air thick with a decadent fragrance that made Su Yan blush with embarrassment.

Unable to resist, she curled up closer into Yang Kai’s embrace. The moment she stirred, she couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise, her fearful yet eager gaze meeting his eyes.

She felt something inside her harden again, as scorching as a red-hot iron, causing her entire body to twitch involuntarily. Even the slightest movement brought overwhelming stimulation.

“Yang…” As before, she barely got out one syllable before her voice was replaced by self-forgetting moans. The tidal waves of sensation left her unable to speak a coherent word, only murmuring softly.

They gave and took freely, merging like flowing water without distinction between them.

By the time they awoke this time—who knew how many times already—Su Yan’s body trembled unconsciously, her fair, delicate flesh glowing with an alluring flush, and between her long legs, a profuse wetness spread.

“Yang Kai.” Biting her ruby lips lightly, Su Yan stared at the cave ceiling of the Ice Cold Cavern, her beautiful eyes hazy like a dying fish, weakly saying, “Please stop, I… I can’t go on.”

Even now, she still felt as if riding a cloud that rose and fell erratically—an intoxicating sensation but one that left her anxious.

She simply could not resist Yang Kai’s demands. Though her heart knew it was time to stop, her body responded instinctively, fiercely yielding.

Her feelings for this man’s advances were a mixture of fear and love.

“Then we’ll stop for now,” Yang Kai grinned, “We’ll fight another day.”

Only then did Su Yan slowly rise, suppressing the soreness in her waist, casting him a scolding glance: “It’s all your fault, only caring about… and we haven’t even practiced cultivation yet.”

Yang Kai let out a sheepish laugh.

Their Dual Cultivation Technique had already reached the Second-Tier stage, so in truth they no longer needed physical union to cultivate together. Yet Yang Kai still chose the most primal, wild way to possess her, without a thought for cultivation.

“Now, I reckon it’s too late to practice. We’ll do that back home,” Yang Kai shook his head. “Looks like we’ve been here over two days. The Senior Uncles must be anxious.”

“Mm.” Su Yan’s cheeks flushed deeply. A single man and woman alone for two days—any fool could guess what had happened. Even her normally indifferent temperament couldn’t help but feel an unbearable shyness.

She got up gracefully, tidying their scattered clothes before dressing Yang Kai with the grace of a devoted wife.

Yang Kai sat motionless on the ice bed, letting Su Yan serve him, his smile never faltering.

“You’re about to ascend to Divine Roaming, aren’t you?” Su Yan, feeling awkward under his intense gaze, tried changing the topic.

“Almost, just a bit more,” Yang Kai nodded, his eyes burning as he looked at Su Yan. “But you’re already at the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Seems I still have a long way to catch up to you.”

“That’s thanks to the elixirs you gave me,” Su Yan nodded slightly. “They really cleanse the marrow. I’m cultivating much faster now. Besides, this place is perfect for me to train.”

A little over a year ago, when they parted, Su Yan was only at the peak of the True Yuan Realm, almost on par with Yang Kai, who was now close to Divine Roaming.

But now, meeting again, she had reached the Third Stage of Divine Roaming — an astonishing pace by any standard, especially since progress usually slows greatly once a warrior reaches Divine Roaming.

“No matter how good external aid is, without a solid foundation it won’t work. Ultimately, it’s your talent,” Yang Kai said, reaching out to caress Su Yan’s cheek. Suddenly, he buried his head deep between her firm peaks, inhaling deeply as if to imprint her intoxicating scent forever in his mind.

Su Yan smiled softly, quietly holding him.

After a long moment, Yang Kai sat up and glanced downward, his expression helpless: “I seem to have…”

“Ah!” Su Yan was suddenly alarmed.

Yang Kai’s expression hardened decisively. “They’ve waited over two days already; what’s a little longer?”

With that, he pulled Su Yan back into his embrace.

An hour later, Yang Kai felt satisfied. Watching Su Yan quickly dress herself before helping him with his clothes, he smiled.

After a painful lesson, she no longer dared reveal herself so freely. If she let him continue like before, they might not leave the Ice Cold Cavern for another ten days or half a month.

When they were fully dressed, Su Yan gave one lingering glance at the cavern.

Once they left, who knew when they might return? This place was ideal for her cultivation—condensing cold qi quickly. It’s not easy for a warrior to find a spot so suited to their growth.

“What do you want to take with us?” Yang Kai asked, sensing her hesitation.

Su Yan shook her head, a hint of regret on her face: “Nothing. Maybe we’ll come back someday.”

“I can take it,” Yang Kai smiled slyly.

Su Yan glanced at him and laughed softly. “That ice bed? You really think you can take that with you?”

Yang Kai nodded seriously.

“No need, that seems like ten-thousand-year ice. I tried to lift it—no way.”

“It’s impossible for you to move it elsewhere either. That little Spatial Pouch you gave me can’t contain something this big.”

Su Yan had a Spatial Pouch, originally gifted to Yang Kai by Ling Taixu, which after the Black Book Space was unlocked, he passed on to her.

But the pouch’s space was limited; it simply couldn’t hold the massive ice bed.

“Watch this!” Yang Kai chuckled and strode over to the ice bed, still imbued with their lingering aura, reaching out to cover it.

Su Yan froze. Though unsure what Yang Kai was up to, she felt a surge of anticipation, convinced he was about to do something extraordinary.

No sooner had the thought crossed her mind than a brilliant light flowed across the ten-thousand-ton ice bed, then mysteriously vanished.

Su Yan’s petite lips parted slightly, barely believing her eyes. She immediately expanded her Divine Sense but detected nothing amiss, her brows knitting in doubt.

“Where did it go?” she asked anxiously, looking at the triumphant Yang Kai.

“I have another treasure that can store items, much bigger than your Spatial Pouch,” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Ah, no wonder,” Su Yan nodded softly.

Learning Yang Kai possessed such a priceless, secret treasure, Su Yan felt only mild shock before swelling with pride.

He was her man, with such astounding skill and deep foundation. She thought, their fate linked, sharing this honor felt only natural. If Yang Kai acted, even piercing the heavens would be ordinary.

The ice cold in the cavern all stemmed from the ice bed. It was the only treasure here. As long as she had it, Su Yan could create her perfect cultivation environment anywhere.

In the village, everyone was ready to depart.

Several Senior Uncles of Lingxiao Pavilion sat solemnly, their expressions grave, moving with utmost caution.

Nearby, Ying Jiu sat silently.

The atmosphere was especially tense.

Those same Senior Uncles had sat with Yang Family’s Blood Servants for two days without moving. At first, they made small talk, trying to engage Ying Jiu — but he was a man of few words, and the conversations soon ceased.

In the end, the Senior Uncles quieted down, all waiting anxiously as if on pins and needles. It was supremely uncomfortable.

Everyone’s mind was racing: why wasn’t Yang Kai back yet?

Even the younger disciples sensed the strange mood, avoiding the area within thirty zhang lest they be dragged into trouble by the Senior Uncles.

Just as tension peaked, Su Mu burst in, bowing respectfully: “Senior Uncles, Senior Brother Yang and my sister have returned.”

“Returned?” The Senior Uncles breathed a sigh of relief, hastily rising with faces both tearful and joyful, rushing outside.

No one wanted to linger any longer.

Facing the formidable and cold Blood Servants of the Yang Family, anyone would feel immense pressure.

Stepping out, they saw Yang Kai and Su Yan walking side by side.

One Senior Uncle’s eyes brimmed with tears as he grasped Yang Kai’s large hand, shaking it vigorously, choking on his words: “Nephew, you’ve finally returned! We’ve waited so long!”

“Hm?” Yang Kai frowned, puzzled by their sudden warmth. They hadn’t been like this when he left two days ago.

Su Yan, understanding the awkwardness, blushed deeply, her normally cool face flushed with a radiant, alluring beauty.

“We’re all ready. Nephew, see...” the Senior Uncle began.

“Ready, then let’s go,” Yang Kai interrupted with a nod.

“Let’s depart, let’s depart!” The Senior Uncle waved emphatically, shouting loudly as the others hurried them onward.

Yang Kai looked on perplexed, unsure why they were so eager, as if rushing to their deaths.

“Young Master,” Ying Jiu approached with a greeting.

“What’s happened?” Yang Kai asked, frowning.

“Nothing,” Ying Jiu shook his head but glanced at Su Yan subtly, his expression shifting.

He noticed this cold and beautiful woman was young yet had cultivated to the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm!

Liu Qingyao of the Liu Family reached that same stage, considered Zhongdu’s number one genius and the future heir of the Liu clan, backed by enormous resources. And what of her?

This woman was formidable!

In an instant, Ying Jiu realized the terrifying power of Lingxiao Pavilion.

The Evil Lord came from Lingxiao Pavilion, the Young Master was also from Lingxiao, and the woman before him as well! This sect even produced cultivators beyond Divine Roaming!

It seemed that the masked Miss Xia in the mansion and Meng Wuya, who lifted his Yuan sealing curse, were also from Lingxiao Pavilion.

This sect… “second-rate”? Ying Jiu was utterly confused.
