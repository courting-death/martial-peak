## Chapter 1029 — Don't Make Trouble

An hour later, Yang Kai had fully recovered and led the others as they continued tearing through the void and pressing onward.

Before each use of this method, he had to determine the direction by the positions of the Divine Sense threads he had left earlier; otherwise there was simply no way to advance within the prismatic domain-field.

Things progressed unexpectedly smoothly; none of the worries Yang Kai had harbored came to pass.

The six following him also kept Yang Kai's admonitions in mind, refraining from using any power; even the Ghost Ancestor behaved dutifully and was quite cooperative.

If things continued like this, it seemed they truly could reach the Chaos Abyss quickly.

Hope lay before them, and everyone's expressions brightened with excitement.

At a certain point in the prismatic sky, Yang Kai reappeared; once the other six arrived, the torn spatial rift slowly began to close.

He smiled at them: "This is the last stretch. Once we pass through this spatial rift one more time, we'll reach the Chaos Abyss!"

At his words, everyone's faces lit up and their eyes filled with anticipation.

"Kid, move faster, I can't wait to see the outside world," the Ghost Ancestor grinned, urging.

"I need a little more time to recover," Yang Kai said calmly.

"Mm, hurry up!"

Yang Kai fell silent and sat cross-legged; he had not lied to the others—indeed only the final stretch remained, and with one more tear in space he could be confident of reaching the Chaos Abyss—but as the moment approached he still felt uneasy.

His unease stemmed from the Ghost Ancestor.

He had no reliable way to restrain that old monster who had lived for over two thousand years from going back on his word once they were out of danger.

He could only passively choose to trust him and pray he wouldn't go back on his word.

The feeling made Yang Kai very uncomfortable.

"Elder, could you remove the mark on my arm?" Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and said to the Ghost Ancestor, "You'll be free soon. There's no need to keep watching me anymore, is there?"

The Ghost Ancestor smiled faintly and said nothing more; with a nod, a wisp of resentful spirit suddenly leapt from the human-faced mark on Yang Kai's arm and shot into the Ghost Ancestor's body. The mark disappeared.

Yang Kai felt a lightness in body and mind, as if some bondage had been unfastened.

"Kid, do your work properly; I won't do anything to you," the Ghost Ancestor snorted.

"Please be tolerant, Elder," Yang Kai chuckled, stood up, and drew a breath. Under the gaze of everyone's eyes, he casually tore open the space.

He was still the first to dive in, leading the way.

The moment he stepped into the chaotic currents of space, Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn. He didn’t advance right away but instead quietly extended his senses to probe his surroundings.

"Why dawdle? You wouldn't try any tricks at the last moment, would you?" the Ghost Ancestor, who had followed in, lowly barked when he saw Yang Kai's strange behavior.

Yang Kai did not answer and continued to sense.

Suddenly his face changed and he barked, "Move! Don't stop! The spatial turbulence here is more chaotic than anywhere else. It must be because we're close to the Chaos Abyss."

He looked as if facing a great enemy; the six others changed expressions and hurriedly quickened their pace to follow him forward.

Wherever Yang Kai went, the turbulent space was temporarily smoothed, preventing them from being snatched by the chaotic void; but even so, everyone faintly sensed the ground beneath their feet—once supposedly stable—becoming sticky, tugging at their bodies. The surrounding spatial barriers writhed monstrously, the streams of turbulence shuttling past like a plague of locusts, sending chills down their spines.

Crack…

A dense chorus of brittle cracking sounded into their very souls. The spatial barriers in all directions seemed to fracture, one split after another tearing open.

From those spatial fissures came an unparalleled suction, eager to swallow them.

Though none of them were masters of space's mysteries, everyone knew the terror of spatial rifts: they leave no trace, no one knows their exact location within the Starry Void, and once swallowed, it was feared no one would ever find them again.

So they mustered all their strength to tail Yang Kai, not daring to lag by even an inch.

Yang Kai's face was solemn; without hesitation his figure moved swiftly to a point ahead, and he reached out and tore the space open.

The spatial barrier was torn open, and through the rift the familiar scene came into view.

Those vast, energy-rich stars lay scattered in every corner of the Chaos Abyss, as bewitchingly magnificent as ever.

Chaos Abyss!

Yang Kai's face brightened with joy as he prepared to dart out.

Just then, Shen Tu and Bi Ya suddenly cried out; something seemed to have happened behind them.

Hearing their shouts, Yang Kai turned and saw the Ghost Ancestor in a hurry, his form trembling as he prepared to separate from the danger before everyone else.

But the moment he exerted his power, the turbulence within the spatial rift seemed provoked and erupted entirely; the calm Yang Kai had strained to maintain was shattered in an instant.

The Ghost Ancestor couldn't escape in time and half his body was swallowed by a fissure; he froze for a moment, and no matter how he struggled, he could not burst free from that spatial split.

The three masters following him, including Yue Xi, also suffered the same fate and were swallowed by the fissure.

When Yang Kai turned back, he saw the pleading looks cast toward him, their yearning for life, their bewilderment.

Even at that moment, they still followed Yang Kai's previous instruction and dared not use any power.

The Ghost Ancestor realized things were amiss; a wave of ghastly spirit energy surged from him as he tried by force to break the fissure's hold.

But the fissure acted like a quagmire—the stronger the Ghost Ancestor's power flared, the faster he sank; his old face abruptly changed color.

"Fuck!" Shen Tu couldn't help but curse. "Brother Yang, go!"

Yang Kai’s expression kept shifting, his eyes filled with hesitation and inner struggle. He looked at the Ghost Ancestor, whose body had been swallowed by the spatial rift leaving only his head visible, then at He Zao and He Miao — countless thoughts flickered through his mind like flashes of lightning.

His body froze in place as an internal battle raged between compassion and practicality.

If he advanced further, he could reach the Chaos Abyss and thereby escape the Ghost Ancestor's threat; swallowed by the fissure, even the Ghost Ancestor would likely never find a way out—he would taste a life more bitter and miserable than being trapped on the Floating Continent, condemned to an old, solitary existence within the spatial rift.

Yang Kai would welcome that scene.

But He Zao and He Miao would equally be doomed.

He remembered: when the Ghost Ancestor once sought to throw him into a Space Array to test the practicality of that Void Passage, it was He Zao who braved stepping forward first and spoke a good word for him.

"Brother Yang!" Shen Tu's roar rang out again. Yang Kai stood in the way, blocking both his and Bi Ya's path. Shen Tu was embarrassed to pass Yang Kai and fumed, hopping about anxiously.

Bi Ya's heart was in turmoil; her lovely eyes fixed on Yang Kai, uncertain what choice he would make.

Hesitation lasted only a moment; in the next instant Yang Kai's gaze hardened. With a casual sweep, jet-black demonic flames flared along the edges of the spatial tear he had opened, the blaze burning so that the rift could not close for the time being.

"Go!" Yang Kai shouted, grabbing Shen Tu with one hand and Bi Ya with the other and hurling them outward. Then, with a darkened face, he dashed backward.

"Brother Yang!" Shen Tu's face changed; he watched Yang Kai brush past him, and by the time he recovered, he found himself in the Chaos Abyss.

Within the turbulent space, Yang Kai quickly reached the fissure that had swallowed the four and stared at the Ghost Ancestor, urgently saying, "If you want to live, restrain your power. Don't make trouble for me!"

The Ghost Ancestor's face went a paler shade and then paled again; he obediently reined in his power and ceased resisting.

"I'll get you out. Don't panic, and don't do anything!" Yang Kai told He Zao and He Miao, then he sat down directly in front of the four. His Divine Sense spread like a tide as he concentrated his Saint Yuan into a single point and poured it into the fissure.

He merged his own comprehension of the mysteries of space into that fissure, causing a resonance so it would temporarily heed his control.

Soon the four who had been sinking found to their delight that the pulling force weakened and faded, then vanished; moreover, a reverse force pushed them upward, freeing them from the fissure's grip.

All four were elated; the sisters He Zao and He Miao had tears welling in their lovely eyes as they stared at the nearby Yang Kai, their hearts filled with joy.

Having thought themselves surely doomed, they never expected Yang Kai to return at the last moment to save them; they all understood that he had taken an enormous risk.

This stirred a subtle emotion within them, an inexplicable warmth that flowed through their bodies.

That feeling dispelled their panic, making them radiant as if no longer afraid of any danger.

Even Yue Xi at that moment altered her view of Yang Kai, gratitude flushed across her lovely face.

"Ah…" He Miao suddenly cried, pointing at a spot beneath Yang Kai.

Everyone looked where she pointed, their faces changing once more.

At Yang Kai's location, another fissure tore open, and his figure began to sink slowly into it.

At the same time, more and more fissures appeared; it seemed those splits would swallow the already chaotic space whole.

Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and barked, "Get out!"

At his shout, the four dared to move, breaking free from the fissure and shooting outward at speed.

Yue Xi fell last; whether from nerves or something else she stumbled and nearly fell, but Yang Kai casually scooped her up, wrapped his arm around her waist, and in a flash they disappeared before the countless fissures widened.

Yue Xi's body went rigid in an instant; feeling the strength and warmth of the large hand on her waist, she was as if under a spell, unable to summon any strength. She turned her head to look at the young man beside her and inexplicably felt an overwhelming sense of safety, as if she were a ship moored in a tranquil harbor, leaving her emotions complicated.
