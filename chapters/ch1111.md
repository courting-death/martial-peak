## Chapter 1111 — You Think You're Something?

But things were different now; since Yang Kai would buy Origin-Grade ore and take it away, all the previous suspicions had been confirmed. He had to consult Master Gelin in person to see if he could be persuaded to intervene—after all, artificers had their own shared language. Perhaps Gelin could find a way to enlist that person's help.

Qian Tong hurried to the palace and relayed the matter to Master Gelin, who grew excited. The two discussed that if Yang Kai came again, Gelin should perhaps step forward and speak with him, at the very least to let the artificer backing Yang Kai know Gelin wished to make contact.

At Dragon Lair Mountain, when Yang Kai returned he found Yang Yan absent from the cave, which stunned him. He immediately dove into the grotto to investigate; the scene inside made his face darken and a cold, murderous light flash in his eyes.

Yang Yan was a simple, straightforward woman; she wouldn't leave without cause, much less abscond with her precious materials.

The skirmish marks inside the cave corroborated that—Yang Yan must have encountered some danger.

Yang Kai flew into a rage.

Not to mention he had just handed over the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion materials to Yang Yan, and he had purchased many ores so she could forge an Origin-Grade defensive Secret Treasure for him. Yang Yan, an Origin-Grade artificer, had been diligently and joyfully crafting for him, and Yang Kai would not allow anything to befall her.

Who did this? The nearby Haike Family?

There weren't many battle traces in the cave—Yang Yan shouldn't have tangled long with her assailants. Though an Origin-Grade artificer, Yang Kai had observed over time that she didn't possess much fighting ability.

If it were truly the Haike Family, Yang Kai wouldn't spare even Wu Yi's face; he'd storm into the Haike Family and make a scene!

He relaxed his Divine Sense and calmed down quickly. Yang Kai's raging fury subsided; he realized matters weren't as dire as he'd feared. Yang Yan was safe, though apparently being chased and fleeing across the mountains, currently in a ravine dozens of li from the cave.

Having learned Yang Yan's location, Yang Kai left the cave at once and sped toward it, Saint Yuan surging within him, his brows drawn into a ferocious scowl.

Moments later, Yang Yan's cries reached his ears, weighing on his heart.

"Yang Yan!" Yang Kai flew straight toward the sound and shouted as he went.

Hearing Yang Kai, the fleeing Yang Yan froze, then a delighted light flashed across her pretty eyes. She lifted her black robe with both hands and hurried over.

Around her body flowed a crimson halo of light, blistering with heat.

It was clearly a very high-grade defensive Secret Treasure—the energy rippling from that aura told Yang Kai that even if he unleashed his full strength, he might not touch Yang Yan at all.

Yang Yan's condition was otherwise fine; aside from panic and disarray she bore no injuries, which put Yang Kai's mind somewhat at ease.

"Wuwuwu... Yang Kai, save me! Someone's bullying me!" Yang Yan sobbed as she darted behind Yang Kai.

"Don't be afraid," Yang Kai soothed, his gaze turning cold as he looked ahead.

Several figures swooped in from that direction. One of them snarled angrily, "Lowly wench, you dared to injure me. You're dead!"

Before the words finished, a vast sword radiance cut through the air—breath-taking sword qi that cracked the earth and reduced trees to powder where it passed.

That sword light brimmed with murderous intent; it was no mere warning but a real attempt to kill.

Yang Kai snorted, pulled Yang Yan aside, and avoided the sword strike.

Five figures landed, encircling Yang Kai and Yang Yan. Yang Yan trembled as she clung to Yang Kai's clothes, a terrified look on her face.

No matter how skilled she was as an artificer, she was still a woman in her twenties with little combat experience and no exposure to truly deadly fights. This encounter had terrified her. Even with Yang Kai there, seeing the ferocity on the faces of the five attackers made her doubt whether he could handle them—after all, she knew his cultivation wasn't high, seemingly only Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Yang Kai turned to look at the five and was a little taken aback.

He noticed Yang Yan untouched, while each of the five pursuers bore injuries. Especially the youth standing before him—roughly his age—whose gaunt, vicious face had a dozen blood holes, as if struck by some attack, his face smeared in blood and shocking to behold.

The other four also bore various wounds; the worst had his abdomen charred and blistered, sweating coldly from his brow—he appeared to have been burned by extremely high temperatures.

"What's going on?" Yang Kai asked, bewildered, glancing at Yang Yan.

Yang Yan's face remained pale, her teeth chattering; with a crying voice she explained, "I don't know... I was resting in the cave when they broke in. That guy demanded I accompany him. I refused, he grabbed me, so I unleashed the Yang Sun Veil and fired my Ghost-Bone Cold Nails, wounding him. Then the other four charged. I shot out the Dragon Whisker Cord, the Ten-Thousand-Fire Sash, the Glazed Ring, and the Profound Cloud Golden Thread, then ran. They pursued me and I kept running... and then you arrived."

Hearing this, the five surrounding them looked embarrassed and enraged; their faces fell.

Yang Kai frowned and pictured the scene: Yang Yan flailing and hastily unleashing a host of high-grade Secret Treasures, the cave filled with dazzling brilliance, those five men getting beaten back and crying out in panic...

Yang Kai felt like laughing.

No wonder she was an Origin-Grade artificer! Yang Kai had never realized Yang Yan possessed such depth. Though her combat skill and courage left much to be desired, with that lavish array of Secret Treasures she could not be trifled with—if she truly intended to kill those five, they would already be dead.

Feeling partly relieved but still irritated, Yang Kai's anger lingered.

Knowing full well Yang Yan was laden with Secret Treasures, the five still pursued her relentlessly; that was excessive. The smarter course would have been to withdraw once they saw her equipment. Their persistence meant they either coveted her beauty or coveted her treasures.

The latter seemed more likely.

Thinking this, Yang Kai's expression turned colder.

The blood-holed youth still hesitated at Yang Kai's sudden arrival, but once he realized Yang Kai was only Third Stage of the Saint Realm he became arrogant and bellowed, "Kid, whoever you are, whatever your relation to this woman, this isn't your business. Scram if you value your life, or don't blame me for killing you too!"

Yang Kai smiled. "This is my territory. You're misbehaving on my turf and threatening my people—how is that not my business?"

"Your territory?" The youth feigned enlightenment. "You must be from the Haike Family then? If so, that's convenient."

His face relaxed and he arrogantly pointed at himself. "My name is Xu Tianze."

He said it proudly, waiting for Yang Kai to react, as if his name should inspire fear.

Yang Kai merely regarded him with indifference, showing no reaction.

Xu Tianze blinked, then loudly called, "Hey, hey, you don't know who I am, do you?"

"I should know you?" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "Who do you think you are?"

Xu Tianze looked at his four subordinates in astonishment, then laughed loudly. "Ha! People in the Haike Family are getting weirder—someone doesn't know me, Xu Tianze!"

"Young Master, this fellow isn't powerful—he doesn't seem to be an important figure in the Haike Family. He likely really hasn't heard of you!" someone beside him offered.

This explanation lifted Xu Tianze's spirits. In a small power like the Haike Family, those who couldn't show their faces weren't worth his serious attention. The only person he feared was the small woman in the wide black robe.

That wench, with her jumble of Secret Treasures, had given him a hard time earlier. Now that he knew of those treasures, Xu Tianze wouldn't let it go—the artifacts made mouths water.

Moreover, the woman seemed to flee rather than fight, making him confident he could seize both wealth and flesh. She was a perfect prize: those breasts and that rear couldn't be hidden even by the loose black robe.

Xu Tianze pictured stripping her bare and couldn't help but grow excited.

He'd only happened to pass by, thought the spiritual qi here was good, came down to take a look, and stumbled on such a rich reward.

Seeing Xu Tianze's lecherous gaze, Yang Yan instinctively clutched Yang Kai's clothes and edged behind him. She whispered, "Yang Kai, they have four Saint King Realm cultivators. Let's run."

"Is Saint King Realm so impressive? I've killed Saint King Realm cultivators before," Yang Kai patted Yang Yan's shoulder.

"You think you can kill Saint King Realm cultivators?" Xu Tianze sneered as if he'd heard a joke. "Do people in the Haike Family speak without thinking? Xu Wei, go teach him a lesson—show him what Saint King Realm means."

"Understood, Young Master." The man named Xu Wei grinned wickedly and strode forward, cracking his neck with audible pops. He snarled, "Kid, you offended my Young Master—your end will be miserable."

"If you touch me, your end won't be any better—die and regret it later," Yang Kai said calmly. As his words fell, a jet of pitch-black flame suddenly leapt forth and rushed toward Xu Wei with lightning speed.
