## Chapter 2236 — A Sword Comes from the West

“The birth of an Artifact Spirit is governed by the fortune of heaven and earth, and more often than not, it’s a matter of chance. It doesn’t actually have much to do with the grade of the Secret Treasure itself. Of course, some say that the higher the grade of the Secret Treasure, the greater the chance of an Artifact Spirit being born. That might be true. After all, an Artifact Spirit can take a thousand or even ten thousand years to form. If a Secret Treasure’s grade is too low, it simply can’t last that long.” Granny You continued as Yang Kai listened in silence.

“And this Divine Roaming Mirror… possesses its own Artifact Spirit!” Granny You said, glancing deeply at Yang Kai.

“Is that the Mirror Soul you mentioned?” Yang Kai raised his brows.

“Exactly!” Granny You nodded slightly. “Since I discovered this Divine Roaming Mirror, I’ve studied it for thousands of years, but I’ve never been able to refine it and make it my own. Until one day, by sheer coincidence, I sensed the will of this world—that is, the Mirror Soul! Without subduing the Mirror Soul, it’s impossible to refine this world. But how could subduing the Mirror Soul be easy? That’s the will of an entire world. Even a Spirit Body like mine, with this level of cultivation, can’t bear its will. If I tried to force it, my soul would be destroyed. Its will is so strong… perhaps even an Imperial-Grade cultivator couldn’t contain it.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but be moved. He exclaimed, “So you thought of using something else as a vessel to bear the will of this world?”

Granny You snorted coldly. “What other way is there? But the requirements for this method are far too harsh. In all the world, how many divine objects could possibly achieve this?” As she spoke, her gaze suddenly burned as she looked at Yang Kai and said, “And the Warm Spirit Lotus you possess is one of them.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai nodded, suddenly enlightened.

“As long as I can obtain the Warm Spirit Lotus, I can use this supreme treasure as a vessel. By merging the Mirror Soul of the Divine Roaming Mirror, I can completely refine this world. At that time, my soul power will soar straight to the Great Emperor Realm. As for that Wen Zishan…” She grinned wickedly and shouted fiercely, “He’ll be nothing!”

“Granny, you really hold a deep grudge against Hall Master Wen…” Yang Kai said with a sigh.

“Don’t mention that bastard to me!” Granny You suddenly erupted in fury. “If not for him, I could have quietly studied the Divine Roaming Mirror, and this natural treasure would have been mine. But eight hundred years ago, he suddenly appeared in the Qingyang Mountain Range. After defeating me, he even tried to lay his hands on this treasure—I simply couldn’t tolerate it!”

“Is that so…” Yang Kai replied casually.

Granny You glanced at him, her anger slowly fading, her tone softening. “Boy, I’ve told you everything you need to know. It’s time to hand over the Warm Spirit Lotus. Don’t worry, I only want to deal with Wen Zishan. Once I’ve settled this grudge, you can do as you please.”

“Then I must thank you, Granny.” Yang Kai grinned, then changed the subject: “But this… is difficult.”

Granny You’s face turned cold, her gaze sinister as she stared at Yang Kai. “Boy, are you going back on your word?”

“No, no, no…” Yang Kai denied flatly. “It’s just that even if I agreed… Hall Master Wen wouldn’t. Isn’t that right, Hall Master Wen!”

With that, he shouted toward the empty space to the side.

“What?” Granny You’s expression changed dramatically. As she shouted, she looked around in alarm, exclaiming, “Wen Zishan is here?”

She looked like a mouse seeing a cat, clearly terrified of Wen Zishan.

But in the next instant, she realized she’d been tricked. There was no sign of Wen Zishan in the void. Instead, while she was panicking, Yang Kai darted away.

“Damn brat!” Granny You roared in fury. Her beautiful face twisted with rage, and with a flicker, she chased after Yang Kai.

Even though Yang Kai used his spatial secret technique, he couldn’t shake off Granny You. He had just run out of the palace when she caught up and blocked his path.

Granny You pointed a finger at Yang Kai. At her fingertip, a vortex of energy swirled, containing immense power.

Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically in shock.

But without thinking, he shouted, “Bloom, Lotus!”

As soon as he spoke, a pure white lotus bud suddenly blossomed around him.

Unlike when he performed the Blooming Lotus secret art outside, this time Yang Kai directly unleashed this supreme Divine Soul Secret Treasure with his Spirit Body. The lotus bud manifested instantly, pure and clear, allowing Granny You to see it in all its glory.

“Warm Spirit Lotus!” Granny You’s face lit up with joy, and her movements paused slightly.

In that instant, the lotus bud trembled and vanished, turning into a stream of light that shot straight into Granny You’s body.

“Ugh!” Even someone as strong as Granny You couldn’t help but groan, her body swaying slightly.

In the next moment, her beautiful face lost all color.

She sensed her soul power rapidly draining away, as if something inside her was devouring her soul. As her soul power faded, the lotus bud quickly bloomed, releasing a captivating fragrance.

Having succeeded, Yang Kai didn’t hesitate. He brandished the Soul-Severing Blade and slashed fiercely at Granny You.

Although she was affected by the Blooming Lotus secret technique, she wasn’t powerless. With a wave of her hand, a sudden gale sent Yang Kai tumbling.

The gap in strength between them was simply too great. No matter how many tricks Yang Kai used, he still couldn’t do anything to her.

He cursed, not daring to linger. With space secret techniques, his figure flickered and in the blink of an eye, he shot out several thousand zhang, fleeing straight out of the royal palace.

Behind him, Granny You’s furious roar echoed from afar.

Inside the royal palace, no one dared make a sound. Zhou Dian, Yu Man, and Yuan Qing all looked toward the source of the noise, their faces filled with shock.

Soon after, outside the palace, Yang Kai’s figure sped away like a shooting star.

He didn’t know what to do now, but he knew that if Granny You caught him again, he wouldn’t be so lucky. At that point, she would surely use her absolute strength to suppress him and forcibly take the Warm Spirit Lotus from his body.

He could only take things one step at a time.

As his mind raced, a terrifying pressure swept over him from behind, pressing down like a mountain.

Yang Kai staggered, nearly falling headlong. In his panic, he glanced back and saw, dozens of li away, Granny You streaking after him like a rainbow, her aura fierce. As she chased, she shouted threats: “Brat, I’ll make sure you die a miserable death!”

Yang Kai ignored her. He pushed his Spatial Power to the limit, fleeing for his life.

But the difference in strength meant his efforts were just a desperate struggle.

Even Zhou Dian could capture him, let alone Granny You herself.

Though both were at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, Granny You had studied the Divine Roaming Mirror for thousands of years. Even if she couldn’t refine it, she could still use some of its powers.

In less than thirty breaths, Granny You caught up.

From afar, she let out a sinister laugh. With a thought, she locked down the space around Yang Kai, preventing him from using Spatial Power to teleport.

This time, she clearly didn’t intend to waste words. She flew straight at Yang Kai, her hand forming a claw, ready to capture and suppress him.

Yang Kai’s face turned ashen. No matter how he racked his brain, he couldn’t think of a way out of this crisis.

Threatening to destroy the Warm Spirit Lotus probably wouldn’t make Granny You stop. That was a last resort, something he wouldn’t use unless he had no other choice.

Seeing he was about to be caught, Yang Kai steeled himself to fight to the death once Granny You got close.

But just then, a sudden change occurred.

From the west, a stream of light drifted over and flashed in front of Yang Kai.

A beautiful figure, exuding cold killing intent.

An exquisite face, with a sharp, chilling sword aura.

Seeing the graceful back of this person, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he called out softly, “Elder Gao!”

The newcomer was none other than Gao Xueting, who had separated from them at the start!

For some reason, she had suddenly arrived and stood before Yang Kai at this critical moment.

Yang Kai noticed she was holding a long sword. The blade was sharp, the sword’s aura surging, and the energy fluctuations were extraordinary.

This was clearly an Imperial Treasure-level Divine Soul Secret Treasure!

Judging by its appearance, it seemed to have just been refined…

But soon, Yang Kai realized something was wrong and shouted, “Elder Gao, you’re no match for her—run!”

Gao Xueting was only at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm. Even though she had entered the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror four times and her Divine Sense was slightly stronger than her physical cultivation, she was definitely no match for Granny You. Her coming here was useless.

Ignoring Yang Kai’s warning, Gao Xueting stood calmly and said lightly, “Don’t worry.”

On the other side, Granny You clearly recognized Gao Xueting as well. Her expression changed and she shouted, “Get out of the way!”

She seemed afraid to attack Gao Xueting, her face full of wariness.

Gao Xueting ignored her, instead turning to Yang Kai with concern. “You’re not hurt, are you?”

Yang Kai shook his head. “I’m fine.”

“Where are Xia Sheng and the others?”

“They’re all imprisoned in the Heavenly Prison. Xia Sheng and the others have suffered some damage to their Divine Souls, but fortunately, their lives aren’t in danger.”

“That’s good!” Gao Xueting clearly breathed a sigh of relief.

“Elder Gao, why are you here?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“I went to Heavenly Yao Mountain,” Gao Xueting replied. “At first, I intended to secretly observe your group’s progress during this trial, but instead, I uncovered some troubling news. That’s why I hurried all the way here—fortunately, I made it in time.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai looked enlightened.

Indeed, Gao Xueting had arrived just in time. If she’d been even a moment later, he would have been captured by Granny You.
