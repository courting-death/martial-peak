## Chapter 2358 — Escape

"Twin Lotus!" Liu Qianyun exclaimed, "No wonder you all asked me where I got that thing. So you were looking for the other Divine Butian Lotus. In that case, Yao Changjun must also know a lot about this twin Divine Butian Lotus."

"He could identify it just by its aura, so he must have studied it," Yang Kai said, raising his eyebrows. "From what he said earlier, it seems that Jixu Ridge has produced Divine Butian Lotuses before, which is why he’s been waiting here for two hundred years."

"But Senior Brother... when I got it, there was only this one," Liu Qianyun said, confused. Although she had obtained that pure white Divine Butian Lotus by chance, she had searched the area carefully afterward and found no other valuable spiritual medicines. If the twin Divine Butian Lotus really was one black and one white, she had no reason to miss it.

"Maybe someone else took it first, or maybe you overlooked it. Either way, let’s focus on escaping that old monster for now," Yang Kai said, then fell silent and began to carefully survey the surrounding terrain.

Jixu Ridge was a notorious and dangerous place near Gao City, but also a favorite training ground for many cultivators. Its unique environment bred many valuable demonic beasts, spiritual herbs, and spiritual medicines, so martial artists from Gao City often came here in groups to search for cultivation resources.

Liu Qianyun had been here many times and naturally knew the terrain well.

Guided by her, the two of them rushed into Jixu Ridge in less than an hour.

As soon as he set foot in this place, Yang Kai felt a chilling aura lingering all around, as if something deep within Jixu Ridge could threaten even him. According to Liu Qianyun, she always trained on the outskirts and never dared to go deeper, because the further in, the more dangerous it became. There had been Emperor Realm experts who, emboldened by their strength, entered Jixu Ridge and never returned.

If she hadn’t been chased to desperation by a demonic beast last time, Liu Qianyun would never have ventured deeper. That she made it back safely was pure luck.

But correspondingly, the deeper one went, the greater the rewards. High risk often tempted some martial artists to take the gamble.

Every year, countless cultivators disappeared or perished in Jixu Ridge.

Still, nothing is absolute. Good things often appeared on the outskirts of Jixu Ridge as well. Once, a martial artist found an Imperial-Grade spiritual herb garden within a thousand li of the ridge’s edge and soared to success from then on.

Yang Kai asked in confusion, "If so many people search the outskirts, how can there still be good things left?"

Liu Qianyun replied, "I’m not sure either. Every time I come here, it feels different. It’s as if the terrain shifts drastically from time to time. Paths I’ve walked and things I’ve seen before often disappear, replaced by new scenes."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai was both surprised and doubtful.

No sooner had he asked than Yang Kai’s expression changed. Without another word, he activated his Origin Qi and instantly teleported over a hundred li, finally widening the gap between himself and Yao Changjun.

The master of Yueting Teahouse truly lived up to being a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. Even though his Divine Sense had been severely damaged, the strength he had left was still far beyond what Yang Kai could handle. He was skilled in space powers, and even with Liu Qianyun in tow, Yang Kai couldn’t shake off his pursuit.

Teleporting took a heavy toll on Yang Kai. The laws of heaven and earth in the Star Realm were extremely suppressive, so every teleport cost him a great deal of Origin Qi and soul power. He also had to protect Liu Qianyun from the pressure of the spatial laws during each jump, making it all the more exhausting.

Fortunately, he had refined many spiritual pills and miraculous medicines back in Thousand Leaves Sect, which came in handy now. For the time being, he didn’t have to worry about running out of strength, but this couldn’t go on forever.

Jixu Ridge was full of dangers—not only vicious demonic beasts, but also many natural arrays and restrictions. Yang Kai extended his Divine Sense and kept his World-Ending Demon Eye active, allowing him to avoid most dangers in advance.

On the other hand, Yao Changjun, who was chasing from behind, seemed unwilling to recklessly use his Divine Sense and often fell into traps or was beset by demonic beasts. But with his overwhelming strength, even if surrounded or trapped, he could break free in no time.

Yao Changjun knew Jixu Ridge far better than Yang Kai. After all, he had spent two hundred years here, not just waiting idly but frequently venturing in and out, hoping to find the twin Divine Butian Lotus.

He had thought that with his strength, Yang Kai would never escape for long. But after chasing for a while, he realized he was wrong.

The distance between him and Yang Kai never closed. Every time he used a secret technique to catch up, Yang Kai would always manage to slip away, leaving him furious yet helpless.

Martial artists who cultivated space powers were truly hard to catch. Yao Changjun had fought such people before and understood this well. Judging from Yang Kai’s use of spatial secret arts, this brat’s mastery of space was astonishing—perhaps not inferior to that person he knew, and certainly beyond what someone of his age and cultivation should be capable of.

Where did this freak come from? Yao Changjun couldn’t figure it out. Could he really be Li Wuyi’s disciple? In the entire Star Realm, Li Wuyi was the foremost expert in space powers.

The chase lasted a full five days, and Yao Changjun still couldn’t catch Yang Kai. He began to wonder if he was going to miss out on this opportunity after all!

If not for his injured soul and inability to use his full strength, a mere Third Stage Dao Origin Realm brat—even if skilled in space powers—would never be able to jump around in front of him like this!

He could have simply locked down the area where Yang Kai was and suppressed him with overwhelming power, leaving him no chance to use space powers at all.

But there were no ifs in life…

Just as Yao Changjun’s face darkened and he swore to make Yang Kai suffer if he caught him, he suddenly sensed something and his expression brightened.

He had discovered that Yang Kai had suddenly stopped moving. Whether he’d run into danger or fallen into a trap, either way, it was good news for Yao Changjun.

He urged his Secret Treasure to fly faster, rushing toward Yang Kai’s location.

"Senior Brother, what’s wrong?" Several thousand li away, Liu Qianyun looked at Yang Kai in confusion.

Just now, Yang Kai had suddenly stopped, his expression shifting rapidly.

"I’m so stupid!" Yang Kai cursed through gritted teeth, looking thoroughly annoyed with himself.

"What is it?" Liu Qianyun didn’t understand why he was berating himself.

"Wait here for me, I’ll be right back!" Yang Kai said, setting Liu Qianyun down, sweeping the area with his Divine Sense, then darting off to a suitable spot.

Moments later, Yang Kai slipped into the Small Xuan Realm.

Yang Kai was surprised that Yao Changjun could pursue him so relentlessly. After all, the man’s soul had been severely injured, so he shouldn’t have been able to use his Divine Sense to lock onto Yang Kai’s escape route or position. In fact, during these five days of fleeing, Yang Kai hadn’t sensed Yao Changjun’s Divine Sense at all.

Yet the man could still pinpoint his location and stay hot on his heels.

Yang Kai had even used spatial divine abilities. Given Yao Changjun’s current state, Yang Kai was confident he could have shaken him off.

How was this possible? The only explanation was that either he or Liu Qianyun had been marked with a secret technique or some kind of imprint, allowing Yao Changjun to track them.

Realizing this, Yang Kai knew he’d been too careless these past five days. If he’d noticed sooner, he might have already lost his pursuer.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai’s senses were magnified infinitely.

Having refined the Xuan Realm Pearl, he was the master of this world. Wherever his mind went, the world’s power followed. Even though the Small Xuan Realm’s laws weren’t perfect yet, it was easy for him to search for anything unusual.

Yang Kai mobilized the world’s power within the Small Xuan Realm, searching himself inch by inch.

He silently prayed things wouldn’t be too complicated. Hopefully, the secret technique or imprint was on himself. If it was on Liu Qianyun, he’d have to bring her into the Small Xuan Realm to check.

After five breaths, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He took the jade box containing the twin Divine Butian Lotus from his Spatial Ring and tossed it to the hastily approaching Liu Yan, saying, "There’s an expert’s aura imprint on this jade box. Erase it."

Liu Yan took it, but before she could respond, Yang Kai had already vanished.

Deep in Jixu Ridge, Liu Qianyun stood alone, looking at the unfamiliar surroundings, her heart filled with unease.

Just now, Yang Kai had slipped behind a small mound and suddenly disappeared without a trace, leaving not even a hint of his aura.

She couldn’t help but feel anxious. Even though she knew Yang Kai wasn’t the type to abandon his companions, she couldn’t stop herself from worrying. Had she become a burden, so he left her behind?

"No, no," Liu Qianyun shook her head. If Yang Kai were that kind of person, he wouldn’t have helped her escape from Biyu Sect back then, or shared half the valuables in his ring with her. Just a few days ago in Yueting Teahouse, he’d risked offending a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert to help her escape.

Senior Brother must have something urgent to do! Liu Qianyun comforted herself.

No sooner had this thought crossed her mind than Yang Kai’s aura suddenly reappeared. He rushed out from behind the small mound.

"Senior Brother…" Liu Qianyun felt a weight lift from her heart and relaxed completely.

Yang Kai dashed up to her, said nothing, grabbed her again, and vanished with another burst of spatial power.

Moments later, the two of them appeared a thousand li away. Only then did Yang Kai summon his wooden boat, pull Liu Qianyun onto it, and urge, "Take off your clothes."

"Ah?" Liu Qianyun blushed instantly at his words.
