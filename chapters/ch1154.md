## Chapter 1154 — A Little Something

The beautiful woman's melodious voice rose, and her unobtrusive description stoked the already fevered atmosphere of the hall even higher.

Earth-shattering wealth, top-tier cultivation techniques, mysterious inheritances—one after another, item by item, these were precisely what set the people in the private rooms' hearts racing.

But everyone knew that her words were pretty but unreliable; it was only a fragmentary map. Who could possibly locate the right spot from such a scrap and investigate what might truly be hidden there?

If this fragment really held immense value, it wouldn't have been brought out for auction; the Jubao Tower's power and resources would naturally organize personnel to seek out the treasure themselves.

The beautiful woman read the crowd’s expressions and knew she had achieved her goal. Smiling brightly, she said, “The starting bid for this map fragment is ten thousand Saint Crystals. Everyone, please begin!”

She didn't even mention the increment for each bid, clearly leaving bidders free to set their own raises.

"Ten thousand!" Though only a fragment, it didn't diminish its collectible value; just because no other fragments were found now didn't mean none would ever surface. Spending ten thousand Saint Crystals to buy it might be a tremendous opportunity, so as soon as the woman's words fell, countless people called out the reserve price.

The beautiful woman smiled faintly and looked toward someone in the hall: "Friend in room number eighty-seven opened the bidding—if any others wish to take it, please raise your bids!"

"Twelve thousand!"

"Fifteen thousand!"

Bidding in the hall surged; even those with private rooms continuously shouted bids, though each increase was modest—at most two or three thousand Saint Crystals.

The fragment with a ten-thousand reserve was soon bid to fifty thousand, then seventy thousand, eighty thousand...

After eighty thousand, the atmosphere in the hall congealed considerably; no one continued to bid.

To spend eighty thousand Saint Crystals on an aimless fragment—no sane person would do such a thing; its primary worth lay only in collection.

Yang Kai shook his head and was about to speak to Wu Yi when he suddenly noticed Yang Yan's expression had turned odd and quietly asked, "What's wrong?"

Yang Yan glanced at him and answered in a low voice, "I think I have a fragment like that myself!"

"What?" Yang Kai exclaimed, astonished. He asked in surprise, "Are you sure?"

Yang Yan nodded solemnly.

"Eighty-two thousand!" Yang Kai bid without thinking. After finishing the price he froze for a moment, then remembered he didn't actually have that many Saint Crystals and felt intensely embarrassed.

But the bid had already been made. Of course it couldn't be retracted—if he tried to take it back, the folks at Jubao Tower would toss him out, and he'd be utterly humiliated.

The atmosphere, long cooled, was roused again by Yang Kai's bid, and the auctioneer smiled all the brighter. She cast her gaze toward the private rooms and loudly announced, "Friend in Box C-13 has bid eighty-two thousand—any higher bids?"

Just as Yang Kai looked helpless, another bid rose from below, finally relieving his embarrassment.

"One hundred thousand!"

Yang Kai clearly felt countless Divine Senses instantly converge upon that person the moment the price was called. There were only two possibilities for someone to so resolutely snatch up a fragment: either they didn't care about the hundred thousand Saint Crystals and simply wanted to buy a chance, or they possessed another matching fragment.

The man who called the hundred thousand seemed uncomfortable and bowed his head immediately, but his appearance had already been noticed; now it was too late to hide.

Yang Kai memorized his features—an unremarkable middle-aged man of limited strength, only First Stage of the Saint King Realm, dressed plainly, not appearing wealthy or influential.

Could it be that this man also had a fragment? Yang Kai wondered silently.

He was sure he wasn't the only one thinking that; once the man left Jubao Tower he might be watched by countless eyes. Buying the fragment could be a hidden calamity.

At that thought Yang Kai grew uneasy inwardly; fortunately that man had resolved his immediate predicament—otherwise the one being watched might have been him instead.

Still, Yang Yan having such a fragment surprised Yang Kai. If two fragments could be pieced together, they might yield clues. Yang Kai secretly pondered whether he should get the fragment from that man, and if so, how to do it without others noticing.

What if, as the auctioneer had claimed, the fragment concealed some world-shaking wealth...

On the raised platform the beautiful auctioneer's voice rang out again: "One hundred thousand—any higher? One hundred thousand once... one hundred thousand twice..."

After calling three times with no reply, the fragment was sold to that middle-aged man for one hundred thousand Saint Crystals. The palace-dressed woman brought the fragment before him, accepted the hundred thousand Saint Crystals, handed over the fragment, and the transaction was complete.

Once he had the fragment, the middle-aged man became more uneasy than before; he clearly wanted to leave this place immediately but dared not act rashly, so he could only sit numbly in his chair.

His behavior only made people suspect more strongly whether he truly possessed another fragment.

The auction continued. Suddenly, one of the two female disciples from Yingyue Hall produced a transmission compass secret treasure and, after sensing, smiled and said, "Young Master Yang, Elder Qian is waiting outside."

"Ask him in, please." Yang Kai had been wanting to find Qian Tong anyway and was surprised he had come himself.

The disciple responded and opened the door; Qian Tong indeed stood outside smiling amiably.

Anyone who had effortlessly raked in thirty million Saint Crystals would be grinning as broadly as Qian Tong was now. As for Yan Pei spreading rumors and stealing his advantage earlier, Qian Tong no longer cared in the slightest.

With those thirty million Saint Crystals, Yingyue Hall would be hard-pressed to lose future lots for lack of funds, and Qian Tong had nothing to say if they were outbid.

"Nephew Yang, I was tied up with business and only just managed to get free—please excuse my delay!" Qian Tong cupped his hands and said politely.

"Elder Qian, you flatter me; without your effort we wouldn't even have the right to sit here," Yang Kai chuckled and invited Qian Tong to sit.

Qian Tong waved a hand. "I must go back to preside over Yingyue Hall's participation in the bidding; I won't detain you. I'm here only to thank you."

"Thank me?" Yang Kai was puzzled and didn't understand what he meant.

"Yes—thank you for bringing a large profit to Yingyue Hall, hehe. This is Yingyue Hall's small token of appreciation; please don't refuse." Qian Tong said as he handed over a Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai hesitated and looked at Qian Tong. "Elder Qian, could you explain more plainly? I truly don't know what I did to benefit Yingyue Hall."

Qian Tong's words carried weight. If he framed this as Yingyue Hall's gesture, he was not merely acting personally but on behalf of the sect—accepting such a favor for no reason made Yang Kai uneasy.

Besides, Yang Kai had only sent over a few auction items, which only helped Jubao Tower; they brought no tangible gain to Yingyue Hall.

Qian Tong seemed aware Yang Kai disliked accepting favors for nothing—when he had given Yang Kai a Rose Pill to heal him previously, Yang Kai had returned it; without explanation, Yang Kai would likely reject this Spatial Ring as well.

After thinking it over, Qian Tong said, “Here’s the thing—those few auction items you sent over at the last moment were of extraordinary value. The major forces who came to participate weren’t prepared for that, so they had no choice but to borrow Tianyun City’s Space Array to return to their sects and gather more Saint Crystals. I… may have charged them a small toll fee.” He coughed lightly, then added with a smile, “So, a large part of that toll was thanks to you, Nephew. Still, since it technically belongs to Yingyue Hall, this old man doesn’t dare hand over too much. Just a small token—please, don’t refuse.”

Yang Kai was stunned; he hadn't expected Qian Tong to be capable of such dealings and felt a surge of admiration. He thought how many people must have been offended by this—no wonder he saw people entering and leaving certain private rooms earlier; they were returning to collect Saint Crystals.

Yang Kai knew the true value of the items he'd sent. Hearing Qian Tong's words, he immediately understood his contribution had indeed mattered.

Yang Kai no longer declined and cheerfully accepted the Spatial Ring, laughing heartily. “In that case, I won’t stand on ceremony. I was actually thinking of borrowing some Saint Crystals from Elder Qian to tide me over, but it seems that won’t be necessary anymore.”

He had indeed planned to borrow some Saint Crystals from Qian Tong; he hadn't intended to participate in the auction much, but the appearance of a fragment made him realize this place might have what he needed. If he saw good items but lacked Saint Crystals to bid, that would be humiliating. And since Wu Yi and Yang Yan were so eager to cheer others on, Yang Kai felt it was time to let them take part.

Unexpectedly, Qian Tong seemed prescient and brought him Saint Crystals.

This delighted Yang Kai greatly.

Qian Tong smiled and said, "As long as you don't bid on excessively precious things, these Saint Crystals should be enough."

He didn't say how many, and Yang Kai didn't press. Some things are known between people and needn't be spread across the city. After all, Qian Tong had said it was Yingyue Hall's property—him providing some to Yang Kai was a tremendous favor.

Just then the auctioneer announced loudly from the stage, "The next item up for auction will interest everyone—please prepare to bid!"

At that, Yang Kai plainly felt the mood in the private rooms become grave; clearly some had received insider hints about the item's nature, while the fighters in the hall below were puzzled yet still excited.

The palace-clad woman presenting the item stepped onto the stage again; on a jade plate sat an exquisite jade bottle. The woman picked up the bottle, removed the cap, and cried out with some excitement, "This auction presents a Origin Condensing Pill!"

As soon as the woman's words fell, the hall erupted into a roar of commotion. The woman looked on, smiling contentedly at the crowd's reaction.
