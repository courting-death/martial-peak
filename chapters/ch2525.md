## Chapter 2525 — To Teach or Not to Teach

The Blood Frenzy Pill, a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level Spiritual Pill, was not difficult to refine; the challenge lay in gathering the necessary materials.

Every ingredient required to refine this Spiritual Pill was an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Herb worth a fortune. Gao Xueting had only managed to collect enough by a stroke of luck, and so she had someone refine a single pill, keeping it on her for emergencies.

Once she took this Spiritual Pill, her potential would be fully unleashed, and her strength at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm might even reach the level of the Second Stage.

This was her final trump card.

Even when attacked together by Zu Hong and Ju Tianqing, trapped in a desperate situation, she had held back from taking it. But now, seeing Yang Kai in mortal danger, she could no longer restrain herself.

Yet just as she took out the Spiritual Pill, Yang Kai stopped her with a shout.

A bitter smile appeared at the corner of her lips. She knew all too well that taking this Blood Frenzy Pill would inflict great harm on her, possibly destabilizing her foundation, causing her realm to fall, or even shattering her meridians and dantian.

But at this moment, aside from the Blood Frenzy Pill, she had no other hope.

“Kid, you still have the mind to worry about others? You’d better take care of yourself first!” Ju Tianqing roared, his Starfire Sea-Cleaving Blade slashing out beams of blade light, as if to carve out a Star Domain right here. His attacks were merciless, forcing Yang Kai to dodge and evade, leaving him with no chance to fight back.

Although he held the advantage, Ju Tianqing couldn’t shake a strange feeling, as if something terrible could happen at any moment, making his back prickle with unease.

“Elder Gao, your disciple is fine. Whatever you do, don’t take that Blood Frenzy Pill.” Yang Kai’s drifting voice echoed from all directions.

Gao Xueting’s beautiful eyes brightened. Seemingly infected by Yang Kai’s confident words, she nodded slightly, “Alright, I won’t take it. Be careful, don’t act recklessly. If you can’t win, fall back to my side at once.”

Yang Kai laughed heartily, “Your disciple is no longer who he once was. Two mere First Stage Emperor Realm cultivators are nothing to me.”

“You’re far too arrogant, brat! Today, this Lord will teach you how to behave!” Ju Tianqing flew into a rage, his aura surging even higher.

Zu Hong’s face was ashen. Though he said nothing, he poured even more power into the Myriad Beasts Seal, sending forth wave after wave of Demonic Beast Spirit Essences from the great seal, which materialized and lunged at Yang Kai.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s figure paused, freezing in place. His eyes turned icy as he stared at Ju Tianqing.

Under that gaze, Ju Tianqing couldn’t help but shudder. For some reason, an uncontrollable urge to flee welled up in his heart. He forced down his panic and unleashed a torrent of blade light at Yang Kai. In an instant, countless rays burst forth, shattering the sky.

Yang Kai said coldly, “Teach this Young Master how to behave? I’m afraid you’re not qualified.”

As he spoke, he flicked his fingers, sending out dozens of slender Moon Blades. They crisscrossed in midair, weaving into a vast net that seemed to envelop the world, sweeping forward.

Li Wuyi had given him a stone containing hidden mysteries of space. Over the course of a month, Yang Kai had absorbed every last secret of space power from that stone like a leech. Now, his mastery of space had reached a new level, and his use of the Power of Space was even more adept than before.

Sss sss sss sss…

The pitch-black Moon Blades swept out, shrouding everything in devouring darkness. In an instant, all the dazzling lights were snuffed out, and even Zu Hong’s Demonic Beast Spirit Essences were shredded to pieces, dozens lost in a flash.

“What kind of divine ability is this!” Ju Tianqing cried out in shock, retreating again and again. He could clearly sense a deadly threat from the Moon Blade net, knowing that if he were struck, he’d be gravely injured if not killed. He dared not face it head-on and wished he could flee as far as possible.

In his haste, he gathered more blade light to try to defend himself.

But to his horror, no matter how much blade light he conjured, it couldn’t stop the pitch-black net in the slightest.

In the blink of an eye, the dark net was upon him.

Ju Tianqing’s face turned pale, and he hurried to escape.

At that moment, a law that seemed to freeze the world crashed down, making him feel as if mountains pressed in from all sides, pinning him in place.

“Laws of Space!” Ju Tianqing’s eyes nearly popped from their sockets as he cried out in alarm.

He finally recalled some intelligence revealed by Yin Lesheng of the Netherworld Sect. Yin Lesheng had once said that this Yang Kai was skilled in the Power of Space.

But Ju Tianqing hadn’t taken it seriously. The Power of Space was one of the hardest forces to cultivate in the world—how could just anyone master it? In the entire Star Realm, countless people sought achievement in space power, but how many succeeded?

Only Li Wuyi of Spirit Beast Island had managed it.

Yang Kai was just a junior. Even if he’d entered the path of space power, he probably couldn’t use it in battle.

But now, Ju Tianqing finally understood—Yang Kai’s mastery of space was beyond imagination. Even if he wasn’t quite Li Wuyi’s equal, he was not far off.

How could anyone fight this!

Everyone knew that martial artists skilled in the Power of Space were the hardest to kill, because even if they couldn’t win, they could always escape with ease.

No wonder he could enter this small world. As an Emperor Realm expert proficient in space power, entering a newly opened small world was as easy as breathing.

Countless thoughts flashed through Ju Tianqing’s mind in an instant. His whole body went cold, and in desperation, he bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of essence-blood, his aura surging.

At the brink of life and death, he actually used an extremely powerful secret technique.

It was the boost from this secret technique that allowed him to move at all.

Sss sss sss sss…

A strange sound rang out, accompanied by Ju Tianqing’s miserable screams. Blood gushed forth like a fountain.

Zu Hong was shocked. Looking over, he was stunned.

He saw that Ju Tianqing’s arm had been severed at the shoulder, the cut perfectly smooth, as if sliced by a blade. From the wound, he could even see Ju Tianqing’s heart pounding violently.

Hiss…

Zu Hong sucked in a cold breath, hardly able to believe his eyes.

What on earth had happened? He’d clearly seen Yang Kai being completely suppressed by Ju Tianqing, with no way out, yet in the blink of an eye, Ju Tianqing was gravely wounded.

His mind spun, and the Demonic Beast Spirit Essences flying from the Myriad Beasts Seal scattered like headless flies.

“Yang Kai, the mountains and rivers will meet again. This Lord will remember you! One day, I’ll tear you to pieces to avenge this lost arm!” Ju Tianqing roared with a twisted face, then turned and shot toward the entrance.

He was actually trying to escape.

But to be fair, it was a wise choice.

Now that Yang Kai had severed his arm and gravely injured him, Ju Tianqing’s strength was diminished. Continuing to fight would only be disastrous for him.

Besides, Yang Kai was a martial artist skilled in space power. He had no chance of killing him, so escaping was the only option.

First, he would return to the Sacred Land and gather all the experts there. As long as Yang Kai remained in the Eastern Territory, even if they had to turn the whole region upside down, they would find him and set up a barrier to tear him to pieces!

Ju Tianqing seethed with rage, his whole body like a volcano erupting.

Watching his fleeing figure, Yang Kai wore a strange expression and didn’t give chase, simply standing there with a mocking gaze.

After a moment’s daze, Zu Hong also realized things were bad, hurriedly put away the Myriad Beasts Seal, and followed Ju Tianqing.

He was already badly injured. Now that Ju Tianqing had fled, staying here would be courting death.

He cursed endlessly in his heart, lamenting his centuries of friendship with Ju Tianqing. That guy hadn’t even said a word before running—how ungrateful! In this world, it seemed you could only trust yourself.

The two fled one after the other at great speed. This small world wasn’t large, so in the blink of an eye, they reached the entrance.

Clutching his severed arm and enduring the searing pain, Ju Tianqing could only grit his teeth and, with his remaining hand, rapidly formed seals, sending wave after wave of marks crashing toward the entrance.

He had set up a secret door before entering, so Zu Hong could follow, and so he himself could leave this small world later.

But now, no matter how many seals he sent, the entrance wouldn’t open.

Ju Tianqing’s face changed, suddenly turning pale. Realizing something, he couldn’t help but swallow hard.

Zu Hong, not understanding, urged anxiously, “Brother Ju, hurry and open the entrance! What are you waiting for?”

Ju Tianqing said bleakly, “It won’t open.”

“How can that be?” Zu Hong cried out in shock, wishing he could slap Ju Tianqing. To fail at such a critical moment was intolerable.

“Heh.” Yang Kai suddenly appeared behind them, smiling as he said, “After I entered, I completely sealed this entrance. Without my method, no one can open it again.”

“What!” Zu Hong was horrified. “How—how do you have such an ability?!”

To seal the entrance to a small world at will—how could an ordinary person do that?

Ju Tianqing’s face was ugly, his heart sinking into an abyss. He said hoarsely, “Brother Zu, this kid is skilled in the Laws of Space.”

Zu Hong was struck like thunder, stunned on the spot.

Yang Kai snorted, “The mountains and rivers will meet again? Elder Ju, I prefer to settle things today. Just now, you said you’d teach me how to behave. Come on, hurry up and teach me. I’m waiting.”

Ju Tianqing’s aura had fallen to rock bottom. Mocked by Yang Kai, his mouth was full of bitterness, as if he’d eaten a basket of bitter herbs, unable to retort.

His eyes dimmed as he said dejectedly, “Young Brother, we were in the wrong today, but things haven’t gone too far. Why don’t we just let it go?”

Yang Kai’s face was cold. “This Young Master isn’t very good at behaving. Are you going to teach me or not?”

Ju Tianqing said angrily, “Why must you press so hard?”

“If you won’t teach, then I will!”
