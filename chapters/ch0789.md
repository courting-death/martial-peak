## Chapter 789 — You, Woman

The lord of the Demon Domain's Barbarian City looked big and clumsy on the surface, but he was actually shrewd and crafty; he knew Yu Mo well, and had Yu Mo not been driven to the brink, Yu Mo would never have praised a human martial artist like this.

The City Lord of Barbarian City immediately realized that this human was indeed extraordinary. With only the cultivation of a First Stage, he had slain Di Xiao of the Third Stage… Among the Demon Race, no one had ever accomplished such a feat. It had always been Di Xiao who killed across realms, yet this time he himself had been slain by someone a stage below—revealing just how formidable this human truly was.

"Gu Man, we'll have to trouble you to make the move this time—I'll cover you!" Yu Mo glanced at Feng Biao, who was not far away, as he gave the order; it was obvious he didn't trust Feng Biao and had to keep a hand free to guard against any rash action on his part.

“No problem—I love crushing the pride and confidence of young people, especially a human like this… it should be deliciously entertaining!” Gu Man nodded heavily, his face brightening, then waved at his men and barked, “Probe his strength, don’t be careless—I don’t want to be the one to collect your corpses!”

The Barbarian City's experts advanced with predatory grins, circling and sizing Yang Kai up with keen interest.

Yu Mo frowned, feeling a twinge of unease, but thinking that so many of them facing Yang Kai alone should be enough, he did not stop them.

“City lord, is there a reward for catching this human brat?” the experts shouted, clearly hoping for a cut from Gu Man.

“Reward my ass! I've been sent out to the edge of the Demon Domain by Lady Xueli; this place is more barren than Sand City, and you still talk to me about rewards? If anyone's to be asked, ask Yu Mo.” Gu Man spat angrily.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened and the corner of his mouth twitched into a faint smile.

Gu Man's complaint, though bitter, revealed a piece of news that thrilled Yang Kai.

This really was the edge of the Demon Domain! That meant that once they left this place, they could escape the Demon Domain.

“What are you babbling about—he's been caught. What, do you think you're going to be shorted your share?” Yu Mo barked.

Gu Man chuckled and said, “Hear that? Lord Yu Mo says there's a reward if you catch him. What are you waiting for, idiots—move!”

The Barbarian City's experts immediately hardened, turning hostile faces toward Yang Kai as they discreetly moved to surround him.

Yang Kai showed no panic; he looked at them coldly. His Divine Sense gathered covertly, ready to unleash the Soul Devouring Worm and slaughter all those below the Saint Realm in one fell stroke.

Just as tensions reached a breaking point, An Ling'er trembled, a look of fear and pain sweeping across her lovely face as she tugged at Yang Kai's clothing.

“What's wrong?” Yang Kai asked softly, brow furrowing—he thought she might have fallen victim to some hidden trick.

An Ling'er's beautiful eyes quivered as she pointed with one finger toward the distance: “Over there!”

Everyone turned to follow her finger and froze at the sight.

In that direction the sky seethed; a mass of thick, roiling black clouds was racing toward them, exuding an extremely unpleasant aura, and within those clouds a strip-like divine intent could faintly be perceived.

Faces blanched all around.

“Saintess Nan?” Yang Kai called in a low voice.

“It should be!” An Ling'er nodded faintly, her eyes dim and empty as if she could no longer see light.

“Damn!” Yang Kai cursed under his breath; chased by Yu Mo and Feng Biao and ambushed by Gu Man's men, he hadn't paid it much mind because he believed that once he entered the Enter Demonic State he could carry An Ling'er and escape to safety.

But at this critical moment the previous-generation Saintess—who in life kills no one yet in death slaughters millions—had somehow chased them here, instantly throwing Yang Kai's plans into disarray and making him anxious.

He had suffered under Saintess Nan's methods before; those were not something he could withstand. Even though he had advanced to the Second Stage into the Transcendent realm, Yang Kai had no confidence.

The last time he escaped her it had been thanks to that Void Passage beneath the sea; now in open wasteland there was no such way out.

Yang Kai's mood darkened; Feng Biao and Yu Mo likewise wore grim faces.

They were all Saint Realm experts and could sense the newcomer's terrifying power—this was an existence even they dared not take lightly.

What kind of high-level figure would come all the way here? The two exchanged puzzled looks and glanced at Yang Kai, hoping for an explanation.

“If you don't want to die, then leave—my reinforcements have arrived!” Yang Kai said coldly, forcing his expression to stay composed.

Yu Mo gave a short laugh. “Why do I feel like the newcomer bears murderous intent toward you and the woman at your side?”

Yang Kai curled his lip, knowing he couldn't fool Yu Mo and the others.

“You really are something else—managing to offend such a powerful enemy and still be alive is a miracle.”

“Do you think I wanted this?” Yang Kai said indignantly. If not for learning a few moves of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique from An Ling'er and wearing her aura, Saintess Nan wouldn't be after him like this.

“But Yu Mo, this person's aura is strange…” Gu Man frowned as he carefully sensed it; he felt the newcomer's qi was deathly still, without the fluctuations a living person should have, and he asked, “What do we do?”

“Grab the brat and leave!” Yu Mo decided on the spot, unwilling to delay further. No matter how odd the newcomer, Yu Mo had already felt the other's strength; even teaming with Gu Man they might not win.

Better to run while they could.

“No need, I'll go with you!” Yang Kai suddenly changed his tune and offered to accompany them; going with Yu Mo and the others might leave a sliver of hope, staying meant certain death—he did not yet have the strength to face Saintess Nan!

“Smart brat.” Yu Mo gave a faint nod of approval, but his face soon changed and he forced a bitter smile. “It's probably too late… this person is very fast!”

No sooner had he spoken than from the distant roiling clouds a perfectly formed, slender jade hand reached out, covering toward their position.

As the hand advanced its palm grew and grew until it blotted out the entire sky, leaving not a sliver of light.

Sky-Covering Palm! A single hand to cover the heavens.

The demon experts swore and Yang Kai hurriedly seized An Ling'er and fled.

Boom…

The earth shook and the patch of dense forest where Gu Man and the others had hidden was slammed into the ground; from above it looked like a terrifying giant handprint spanning many li.

Like a natural disaster, gale-force winds swept, sand and rock flying; a few unlucky Barbarian City experts failed to dodge and were smashed into bloody pulp.

The rest, thanks to superior cultivation, barely avoided the calamity.

Yu Mo and Gu Man gathered together, their faces more ugly than ever; though they had known the newcomer's power, only when the other struck did they realize they'd underestimated this person's methods.

At least two Stages of the Saint Realm! That was the minimum cultivation.

Hovering in midair, Yu Mo and Gu Man had no desire to fight and only wanted to get away, but they dared not make any rash move because a divine intent had already locked onto their bodies—any action would bring ruthless killing.

They both drew a deep breath and looked toward one direction, where a willowy woman in white was walking slowly.

Her features were exquisite, her figure slim, her bearing extraordinary—a beauty rarely seen in the world.

But at this moment her expression was wooden, and deathly qi flowed from her brow, making her complexion look dark and lifeless.

Yu Mo and Gu Man could sense no trace of life from her.

As she walked, slender fingertips unleashed refined energies that formed sharp strikes and swept toward the Barbarian City's experts.

Those below the Saint Realm had no means to resist these attacks and, within a few breaths, were all cut down to nothing, not a single one left alive.

Gu Man's eyes filled with murderous hatred as he roared, “You stinking bitch, how dare you harm Gu Man's people?”

Yu Mo's face turned dark as he shouted, “You woman—killing without asking questions, isn't that going too far?”

The unhurried Saintess Nan gave no reaction to their shouts; her beautiful eyes did not even blink.

Yang Kai inwardly felt pleased, though outwardly he remained expressionless.

Saintess Nan was already dead; Yu Mo and Gu Man would receive no reply to their words—Yang Kai was more than happy to watch the spectacle.

The only difficult thing now was how to escape this former Saintess's wrath; even with Yu Mo and Gu Man to intercept, Yang Kai estimated they would not hold out long.

As Saintess Nan drew ever closer in midair, Yu Mo and Gu Man's hair stood on end; exchanging a look, they rapidly consolidated their strength.

They knew that today they had no choice but to fight this woman.

Even Feng Biao, who had been watching, wore a face of fury; he too had been locked by Saintess Nan's divine intent and, to live, had to temporarily join Yu Mo and Gu Man in resistance.

The three one-Stage Saint Realm cultivators grouped together; even if they could not defeat Saintess Nan, they might at least buy time to flee.

A moment later, when Saintess Nan closed to roughly thirty Zhang, surging Demon Yuan suddenly erupted from the three Saint Realm experts, each unleashing their full strength to attack her.

A colossal sword appeared from thin air and slashed down toward the three, carrying world-shattering might.

Xuantian Sword!

The great sword contained a dense deathly intent that chilled Yu Mo and the others to the bone.
