## Chapter 1807 — Ascension

"What is happening, what is happening—could this damned place be about to be destroyed?" Lü Guichen stumbled and rushed toward the place where Yang Kai was ascending.

He had only been tending his wounds for a short while; when he opened his eyes he suddenly found that the aura of the entire Floating Continent had changed violently — thunder rolled across the sky, black clouds covered the heavens, and the Spiritual Qi on the ground seethed and writhed.

He was completely stunned, utterly clueless as to what was going on, and could only follow the source of the commotion in order to investigate.

While sprinting, he saw that the black cloud in the sky was swelling in size, and within that blackness dark lightning kept streaking through it, as if rows of savage, terrifying jiao dragons hid inside, occasionally thrusting their heads out.

The sight truly made his heart quake.

After rushing over a hundred li, Lü Guichen's vision blurred, and suddenly before him appeared a grotesque demonic beast that radiated a blood-colored brilliance all over its body.

Lü Guichen jumped in fright and halted at once, for he saw malevolent light streaming from the blood beast's eyes, as if warning him not to approach.

He was certain that if he advanced any further, that blood beast would unleash a thunderous strike upon him.

He knew that the blood beast had been conjured by Yang Kai, so after a brief thought Lü Guichen realized that the current situation on the Floating Continent was definitely related to Yang Kai.

Was it the commotion from refining that Stellar Origin? Lü Guichen guessed wildly in his mind but could not get a clear idea.

After a moment's thought he shot into the air, stood on higher ground, and peered ahead.

Yang Kai's figure instantly imprinted upon his sight, though he was thirty li away. But Lü Guichen, now a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, possessed keen vision; he could see the scene at thirty li with clarity.

"This... this can't be a breakthrough, can it?" Lü Guichen cried in alarm, his whole body trembling.

Yang Kai was Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — if he broke through, would he not ascend to the Void King Realm!

The three words Void King Realm rang in Lü Guichen's mind like a great bell, vibrating so fiercely he nearly fell from the sky.

Void King Realm! That was the top-tier force in the Star Domain. Lü Guichen could hardly believe that he would one day witness a martial artist breaking into the Void King Realm; he bit his tongue hard to feel pain and make sure he was not dreaming or hallucinating.

Decades ago Void King Realm experts had seemed so lofty and unattainable; a casual glance from one was enough to scatter his soul.

Even now, decades later, Lü Guichen still understood the terror of the Void King Realm.

The higher one's strength grew, the more one could comprehend the height that the Void King Realm represented.

That youth, so young, was about to break into the Void King Realm? When he had first seen him the boy had only been in the Saint Realm, and Lü Guichen had casually sealed him back then...

The past was like smoke, yet remained vivid in his mind.

If he succeeded this time he would undoubtedly be the youngest Void King Realm expert in the entire Star Domain — an achievement unprecedented and capable of shaking the ages!

Lü Guichen bit his tongue again, pushed aside his wild imaginings, descended to the ground, and sat cross-legged.

He knew this: such a scene was surely a chance.

To observe a Void King Realm expert’s ascension at such close range was not something one encountered lightly. If one could glean insight from this Heaven-and-Earth Baptism, future cultivation would sail smoothly.

So Lü Guichen resolved without hesitation to watch closely.

The black clouds in the sky grew ever more formidable, and when that atmosphere stiffened to a certain peak there came a cracking sound — a pitch-black radiance flashed, like a startled dragon bursting forth from the heavens, cleaving down toward a particular spot.

From that direction came Yang Kai's muffled groan; the very ground shook uneasily.

"This..." Lü Guichen was aghast and cried out in alarm, "So terrifying!"

A Baptism — whenever a martial artist advanced a great realm, they would face one; it was the Heaven-and-Earth law testing the cultivator. Those who passed advanced greatly; those who failed either regressed or perished.

Lü Guichen, being an Origin Returning Realm expert, had undergone Baptisms more than once.

When he had ascended to the Origin Returning Realm in this place it had been only twenty or thirty years ago.

But the intensity of the Baptism back then was not even a fraction of the power of the pitch-black bolt now.

That had been only the first strike; the subsequent Baptisms would only grow stronger and more terrifying!

"If it were me, could I endure it?" Lü Guichen couldn't help but fantasize, putting himself in Yang Kai's position and imagining facing such a dreadful Baptism at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

The result was...

He could not endure it — absolutely could not. Even if fortune allowed him to hang on through the first strike, the second and third strikes that followed would certainly take his life.

With that thought, Lü Guichen’s aura suddenly turned chaotic, and the Martial Dao resolve he had always upheld in the depths of his heart began to waver.

Crack...

The second strike descended; though that pitch-black energy struck Yang Kai dozens of li away, its destructive aura pierced straight into the gaping flaws of Lü Guichen's heart and mind.

With a wet “wah…” sound, Lü Guichen spewed a mouthful of blood, his whole body deflating like a punctured ball as his strength instantly withered.

His realm began to regress at a speed visible to the naked eye — Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, Third Stage of the Saint King Realm...

He eventually stopped at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm.

There is a saying: if you don't do foolish things, you won't die foolishly!

Lü Guichen had wanted to observe Yang Kai's ascension to gain benefit; that desire was not wrong, but he did not know that Yang Kai's Heaven-and-Earth Baptisms always differed from ordinary ones — the Heaven-and-Earth energy he faced was several times stronger than that faced by any other cultivator.

This time was the threshold of his breakthrough to the Void King Realm — even Yang Kai himself held great fear toward the Baptism of heaven and earth, let alone a mere Lü Guichen.

He had overestimated himself by placing himself in Yang Kai's position; that was his own doing.

The Martial Dao heart should grow stronger under setbacks and push one ever forward; Lü Guichen doubted himself, and the destructive aura that seized upon that doubt shattered and then crushed his Martial Dao heart.

The reason he survived was mainly that his Martial Dao heart collapsed too quickly.

Had he persisted a little longer, he would likely have died on the spot.

Lü Guichen sat there in a daze, his mind completely blank. Even as his cultivation realm plummeted, dropping back to what it had been decades ago, he seemed utterly oblivious to it.

His eyes were dull and dark, without a trace of light.

Meanwhile.

Outside the space where the Floating Continent resided, in the Chaos Abyss,

the strong waited for a long time and still saw no sign of Yang Kai; Zi Long and his son grew impatient and violent.

Ghost Ancestor, however, was leisurely and carefree, his face like a breeze.

Xue Yue, though having received Ghost Ancestor's assurances, still felt uneasy and leaned in to whisper, "Senior, it's been nearly ten days — why hasn't there been the slightest movement?"

"What movement do you want?" Ghost Ancestor looked at her with a grin. "He is hiding in there in absolute safety; if there were any movement, wouldn't that be terrible? Do you want him to come out now?"

"No." Xue Yue hurriedly waved her hand. "As long as he's safe I'm relieved, it's just that I..."

"Be reassured, I know what you're worrying about — is my promise not enough? That damned place could bind me for two thousand years, but it cannot hold Yang Kai. When he wants to come out, he will come out. Little girl, you care for him very much; yes, when he emerges I'll relay your concern carefully."

"Senior..." Xue Yue blushed and stamped her feet.

"I can't wait too long," Ni Guang frowned at the side. "The Commerce Guild has a whole heap of matters needing attention; I cannot linger here. If I leave, Old Ghost, can you alone contend with Zi Long?"

"You underestimate me?" Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly. "Zi Long is nothing."

"Even if you don't care about Zi Long, if that brat Yang Kai bursts out, Xu Wei and Kong Fa will surely set their sights on him. If you're stretched thin, what will you do then?"

Ghost Ancestor's brow knit.

This was exactly his worry.

If Ni Guang left and Yang Kai came out, Zi Long's side would then have three Void King Realm experts. He could at best stall Zi Long and the badly injured Xu Wei, but could Yang Kai handle Kong Fa?

Now Kong Fa also stood with Zi Long — who knew what rewards Zi Long had promised him.

Headache...

What Ghost Ancestor most hoped to see now was that Yang Kai remain hiding inside until it was truly safe to emerge; he did not trust that Zi Long would stay here forever — after all he was the master of the Purple Star, he had other matters to attend to.

"Hm?" Ni Guang suddenly furrowed his brow and focused his gaze on a certain spot. "This is..."

"Something's wrong — what is happening?" Ghost Ancestor also murmured.

Over on the other side, Zi Long, Xu Wei, and Kong Fa, the three Void King Realm experts, simultaneously noticed an abnormality in the Chaos Vortex: a patch of space seemed to tremble and rupture, as though riven with spatial fissures, and from those ruptures there came an extraordinarily violent power.

"What's going on?" Ni Guang asked, puzzled, glancing at Ghost Ancestor for an explanation.

"Looking to me for answers?" Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly. Although he had been trapped on the Floating Continent for two thousand years, he did not know what the scene before him truly meant.

"Could it be that the Chaos Vortex is about to emerge?" Xue Yue asked in alarm.

Those words startled Ghost Ancestor and Ni Guang.

The Chaos Vortex was not something one could blithely wander into — if it truly appeared then they would all have to flee for their lives. Ghost Ancestor had once been sucked into the Chaos Vortex and cast into the Floating Continent and had survived only by luck; he did not wish to attempt it a second time. If fortune failed them and they were torn apart by the chaotic force, there would be nowhere left to weep.
