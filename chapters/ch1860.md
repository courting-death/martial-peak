## Chapter 1860 — Reckless Bidding

At that moment, in Room A-2, Zi Wuji's face had darkened as he stared toward where Gongsun Liang sat, one hand clamped on the arm of his chair — the sandalwood handle had already been crushed to powder.

Standing beside him, Ji Jun's expression was also hideous.

"Second Young Master, that old bastard is definitely doing this on purpose!" Ji Jun spat angrily.

"I'm no fool — how could I not know that?" Zi Wuji ground his teeth. "I said someone like him wouldn't suddenly show up at the Tongtian Auction House for nothing — it was meant to mess with me. That old bastard sure has time on his hands."

Ji Jun snorted coldly, "That old bastard must fear your gaining strength, so he resorted to such a sinister obstruction."

Zi Wuji silently swore that one day he would make him pay.

The five hundred million Saint Crystal price had already exceeded his expectations. Although he was Purple Star's Second Young Master, he had long lacked power and influence and had kept a low profile, so he did not possess great wealth himself; all of Purple Star's resources tended to favor his Eldest Brother, Zi Donglai.

If not for Zi Long and Zi Donglai going missing in the past two years, he would not have stepped forward now and would have chosen to remain hidden.

To contend with Gongsun Liang required true strength, so the Void King Pill was crucial to him; if he could use the pill's power to breakthrough to the Void King Realm in a short time, he would gain a vital advantage.

Even he could not obtain a Void King Pill easily!

After a moment's thought, Zi Wuji did not back down; he gritted his teeth and called, "Six hundred million!"

Six hundred million Saint Crystals were his bottom line — the largest sum he could produce now. If Gongsun Liang raised the price further, he would have to swallow his pride and give up.

As expected, Gongsun Liang showed no mercy and leisurely shouted, "One billion!"

The tone made it sound as casual as saying ten thousand or a million.

At those words, everyone's faces shifted; even Li Nuo, who had been smiling on the stage, couldn't help furrowing her brow, sensing that something was amiss.

"One... one billion!" the cultivators below exclaimed. "No way — did I hear that right? Did the Great Elder really call one billion?"

"I thought I misheard too. How could it be such an astronomical sum?"

"True, a Void King Pill is precious, but it shouldn't fetch one billion. The last time Rongyuan Auction House sold a Void King Pill, it went for only five hundred and eighty million."

"No wonder the Great Elder is so well funded — one billion is nothing to him!"

Voices argued below, but a few sharp observers sensed something off.

Gongsun Liang's flamboyant bidding was clearly aimed at the people in Room A-2, but even so, would he treat a few hundred million Saint Crystals as nothing?

"Gongsun Liang, are you deliberately causing trouble?" Ji Jun, unable to tolerate it any longer, shouted angrily from Room A-2.

Boom...

The hall erupted again; everyone looked stunned toward Room A-2, wondering who could be so bold as to call the Great Elder by name.

What had been an ordinary auction turned turbulent from these successive incidents; a dangerous mood spread through the entire auction hall.

Li Nuo on the stage had sweat in her palm and an uneasy look in her beautiful eyes.

Unexpectedly, Gongsun Liang did not take offense; he only smiled and said, "Ji Jun, what do you mean by that? This old man liked this Void King Pill and bid — what's wrong with that?"

"You know what's wrong yourself." Ji Jun snorted coldly. "Even if you are Purple Star's Great Elder, one billion Saint Crystals are not something to be produced casually. Now that you have bid, I want to see how you pay! Li Nuo, I suspect Gongsun Liang is bluffing and cannot fulfill one billion Saint Crystals; if you don't believe me, you may verify it."

Li Nuo hesitated — asking her to verify whether Gongsun Liang could produce one billion Saint Crystals was tantamount to courting death.

Gongsun Liang's bid had already been announced; whether he could pay or not, the spiritual pill was already his — even if the Tongtian Auction House suffered a loss, they could only swallow it.

"Ridiculous — you dare question the Great Elder's reputation, Ji Jun? You're looking for death!" someone in Room A-1 shouted.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he immediately recognized the speaker as the Eighth Elder, Jiang Changfeng, who had earlier gone to the Commerce Guild.

"Justice rests with the people — if the Great Elder truly can pay one billion Saint Crystals, I will have no objection," Ji Jun persisted.

"Ji Jun, you insolent brat!" Jiang Changfeng roared, and Saint Yuan fluctuations surged from Room A-1, as if a blow could break out at any moment.

Cultivators in the hall panicked, faces filled with terror.

If the two sides fought, they would be doomed; the aftershocks from a Void King Realm battle were beyond what ordinary people could endure.

Gongsun Liang chuckled, "No need for Eighth Elder to stoop to his level. Since he wants to verify, this old man will let him verify. Li Nuo, bring that spiritual pill over."

Li Nuo stepped forward and walked toward Room A-1.

In a short while she entered the room, smiling as she placed the jade bottle before Gongsun Liang and said, "Great Elder, this is the spiritual pill you purchased."

Gongsun Liang merely nodded slightly, not even looking Li Nuo squarely in the eye.

Jiang Changfeng's face was cold as he took out a ring and handed it to Li Nuo, loudly instructing, "Li Nuo, please thoroughly check whether this is the sum of one billion!"

Li Nuo's expression turned grave as she took the ring and swept it with her Divine Sense; her face changed slightly and then she smiled, "Quantity confirmed correct. Funds and goods are exchanged — the Great Elder is an honest man and is not making an empty bid."

"The transaction is taking place in your rooms — who knows what's real or fake?" Ji Jun sneered.

Jiang Changfeng taunted, "Li Nuo personally verified it. Could it be false? As the auction house's proprietor, she wouldn't do business that loses money."

"Li Nuo is only at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — how could she dare resist your might?" Ji Jun jeered.

"Enough, Elder Ji — no need to say more." Zi Wuji said calmly.

Ji Jun's anger did not subside, but he obediently fell silent.

Zi Wuji laughed lightly and called toward Room A-1, "Congratulations, Great Elder, on winning the spiritual pill."

Gongsun Liang replied, "Second Young Master, you flatter me. Auctioned items go to the wealthy. This spiritual pill is of little use to this old man. It would, however, benefit you; if you wish, this old man can gift it to you — what do you say?"

In Room A-2, Zi Wuji's brow twitched, then smoothed into a smile, "Great Elder, you jest — this Wuji dares not accept such a precious item."

The two traded a few light words as if chatting, and the previous tension evaporated.

Only then did people realize that the person in Room A-2 was Purple Star's Second Young Master, Zi Wuji.

Considering the earlier competitive bids and the rumors they'd heard, many immediately understood that the ill will between the Second Young Master and the Great Elder was not without cause, and worry spread across many faces.

For most cultivators, who ruled Purple Star was none of their concern, but they did care about not being caught up and harmed by the clash between those two men.

The auction of the Void King Pill thus concluded — in the end no one truly knew whether Li Nuo had received one billion Saint Crystals; the matter remained a mystery.

The next item up was the land deed Hua Youmeng had consigned to the Tongtian Auction House.

Land deeds only interested merchants, so the experts in the A-Class rooms stayed out; instead there was fierce competition among the buyers in the B- and C-Class rooms.

A whole row of shops on Tenglong Avenue, if purchased and properly managed, could multiply a Commerce Guild's strength — such an opportunity few merchants would pass up.

Consequently, the bidding was intense.

The one hundred million Saint Crystal starting price climbed steadily and finally sold for two hundred sixty million.

In Room A-5, Hua Youmeng nearly fainted with happiness.

Although Li Nuo had previously worked out the sums with her, she had never imagined the deeds would fetch such a high price.

Millions of Saint Crystals were already a huge number for the Commerce Guild; let alone sums in the hundreds of millions.

With two hundred sixty million, the Commerce Guild's expansion was no longer a dream, and Xia Jingwu and Yao Qing could confidently purchase cultivation resources to strengthen themselves.

With strength would come further development for the guild — a snowball effect.

And all of this had been brought about by the man beside her.

Hua Youmeng gazed at Yang Kai in a daze, her face full of gratitude.

"Sir, could you take ninety percent of these Saint Crystals and leave ten percent for us?" Hua Youmeng asked timidly, for even ten percent would be more than twenty million.

Yang Kai cast her a look and smiled, "Those Saint Crystals came from selling your deed — why should I take ninety percent?"

"Even so, without you, others wouldn't have handed the deed to us," she murmured.

Yang Kai waved his hand, "Saint Crystals mean nothing to me. The things I need are not something Saint Crystals can buy."

"But..."

"It's settled." Yang Kai smiled and cut her off.

"Sir..." Hua Youmeng choked on her words, moved to tears; gratitude overflowed her features — even if Yang Kai asked her to give herself to him then, she would not have frowned.

"Next is the final lot," Li Nuo announced from the stage. "Alas, even my own eyes and those of Tongtian's appraisers are at a loss — to this day we still do not understand what this item truly is."

"What? You don't know what it is and yet dare to auction it? Tongtian Auction House is being too frivolous."

"Don't think we ordinary cultivators are easy marks — our Saint Crystals weren't blown in by the wind."

"Quiet. Since it's the last lot it must be extraordinary — maybe even rarer than that Void King Pill. Let's wait and see."

A group of cultivators immediately began clamoring.
