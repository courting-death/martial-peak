## Chapter 1791 — Everlasting Tree and Immortal Source Liquid

"Haha, still no match for Brother Zi Long." Ni Guang laughed loudly; with just a casual sweep he already understood the current situation, then he said, "Since there aren't many people yet, the two of us should act quickly. The three drops of Immortal Source Liquid must be taken first—each of us take one drop, and the remaining drop…"

Before Ni Guang could finish, a voice came from afar: "Oh? So this is Immortal Source Liquid. Then this must be the rumored Everlasting Tree? Heh heh heh heh, it seems this old man has been fortunate indeed — the remaining drop of Immortal Source Liquid belongs to this old man!"

As the words fell, a mass of black qi rushed over; the black vapor was ink-dark, seeming to swallow even light. Within that blackness, the faint silhouette of Ghost Ancestor could be discerned.

Ni Guang and Zi Long both paled slightly and turned their heads to look in Ghost Ancestor's direction.

Ghost Ancestor planted himself boldly and, after glancing at Ni Guang and Zi Long, chuckled and asked, "You two have no objections, do you?"

Zi Long and Ni Guang exchanged a look, their gazes meeting for a moment as if they were communicating something, and soon Zi Long nodded: "With your cultivation you are more than a match for both me and Ni Guang. This third drop of Immortal Source Liquid, take it yourself."

"I concur." Ni Guang inclined his head in agreement.

"If that is so… then let's begin." Ghost Ancestor chuckled.

Although his overwhelming strength had won Ni Guang and Zi Long's recognition, he was still at a loss over how to actually obtain the Immortal Source Liquid, so he did not rush to strike first. Instead he intended to observe Zi Long and Ni Guang's actions before making his plan.

In that short time, where the plain had been empty a moment ago, a crowd of Void King Realm cultivators had gathered; Zi Long seemed to fear delays and immediately began to act.

He raised his hand and something bronze-colored appeared, coiling like a giant python. As he poured Saint Yuan into it, the two eyes on the creature's head slowly bloomed with light, and the whole thing seemed to come to life.

"A puppet?" Ghost Ancestor narrowed his eyes and understood at once—Zi Long had come prepared. Puppets were not made of flesh and blood and thus should not fear the terrifying might of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light. Sending a puppet into the Seven Luminaries Divine Light to fetch the Immortal Source Liquid was the best and most reliable method.

But… could it really be so easy? Ghost Ancestor felt doubt but kept his composure, turning his gaze to Ni Guang.

Ni Guang likewise released a puppet, though not of python form. It was a humanoid puppet—crafted by some master, so lifelike that at first glance one might mistake it for a real person; only careful scrutiny revealed that there was no life in it.

The two differently shaped puppets surged forward under Ni Guang and Zi Long's control, both rushing toward the location of the Everlasting Tree.

The giant python writhed and advanced across the ground. The humanoid puppet launched itself in a forceful dash.

Before long, both puppets charged into the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; the instant they entered, their speed plummeted as if they had sunk into quicksand, laboring with every step.

Not only that, but the puppets emitted a series of cracking sounds, as if some immense force suppressed them and made their joints difficult to move.

Ni Guang and Zi Long's faces both turned grave.

Although they had come prepared with the best puppets, they had underestimated how terrifying the Seven Luminaries Divine Light truly was. While puppets of no flesh might not be corroded by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light's erosion or its defense-ignoring killing power, the omnipresent pressure was not something a puppet could easily withstand.

If this continued, it would not be long before their puppets were crushed to powder by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

At the thought, Zi Long did not delay; he repeatedly stimulated his mind and pushed the python puppet forward.

In an instant the python's speed increased greatly, and after expending considerable effort the python puppet finally reached the Everlasting Tree.

At the same time, Ni Guang's humanoid puppet arrived close behind.

Heat flared in both men's eyes; with a thought they issued orders to their respective puppets.

The next moment the python coiled around the entire Everlasting Tree and exerted terrible force, seemingly intent on uprooting the tree!

The humanoid puppet was even more direct: it gripped the tree's roots with both hands and heaved with all its might.

The two Void King Second Stage experts clearly held the same plan.

Thus the python puppet tightened its hold on the humanoid puppet, and the humanoid puppet could not act at full strength; a dense chorus of cracking echoed from within both puppets.

Ghost Ancestor's eyelids twitched as he felt a twinge of annoyance.

After all, he had a share in those three drops of Immortal Source Liquid, and Ni Guang and Zi Long's plan to seize the fruit without informing him left Ghost Ancestor displeased.

But he soon let out a mocking laugh, for he realized the two puppets had no coordination and were actually restraining one another; furthermore, the seemingly fragile Everlasting Tree, subjected to the puppets' frantic destruction, remained unscathed and still looked fresh.

“Brother Ni, have your puppet withdraw first,” Zi Long suddenly barked. “I give you my word — if we can obtain the Everlasting Tree, you’ll have your share!”

As he spoke, Zi Long continued to urge the python puppet on.

Ni Guang sneered: "Brother Zi, why don't you have your puppet withdraw first? This old man can also guarantee that if we obtain the Everlasting Tree, I will likewise share a portion with you!"

They exchanged another glance, each reading distrust in the other's eyes; both snorted coldly and stopped paying attention to one another.

The situation immediately became a standoff.

At that moment Kong Fa of the Spine of the Star River arrived; seeing the scene before him he was momentarily stunned and didn't immediately understand what had happened. When he spotted Xu Wei he brightened and moved to join him.

After all, those two were cut from the same cloth—most fond of conniving together.

But just as he took a step, Xu Wei subtly shook his head at him.

Kong Fa halted and, pondering, looked at Xu Wei and then at Zi Donglai beside him, his face growing serious.

He also noticed that Xu Wei was missing an arm, and that for some reason he was standing with people from Purple Star.

Not understanding the situation, he dared not act rashly; he scanned the surroundings and then came up to Meng Tong, clasped his fists, and asked, "Brother Meng, may I ask what is going on here?"

Meng Tong glanced at him and did not hide anything, simply reciting the current situation.

Meng Tong was always alone, so he bore no grudge with the Spine of the Star River; sometimes he even went to the Abandoned Nest and the Spine of the Star River because he could often find cultivation materials there. He had met Kong Fa a few times.

Thus Meng Tong did not conceal anything when Kong Fa asked.

"The Everlasting Tree and Immortal Source Liquid?" Kong Fa's body trembled and his eyes flashed with fanatic desire; he stared toward the center of the field, his pupils spinning as if turning over some crooked idea.

"Brother Kong, calm yourself. There are three Void King Second Stage experts over there. If you act rashly the consequences will be grave." Meng Tong warned with a smile.

Hearing this, Kong Fa restrained the fervor on his face and gave a slight nod. “Brother Meng is right,” he said. “However… judging by the current situation, it doesn’t look like any of them will be able to take it easily.”

"That's our opportunity," Meng Tong said in a low voice. "Wait. When matters turn, perhaps we can snag some benefits."

Kong Fa agreed and fell silent, concentrating on watching.

Elsewhere, Zi Donglai glared at Ni Guang, who was locked in a standoff with his father over the Everlasting Tree, his face vicious. He thought that if Ni Guang had not interfered, his father would have long since claimed the tree. Because of the Hengluo Commerce Guild's Ni Guang, his father was at a complete loss—truly infuriating.

Suddenly Zi Donglai spotted the solitary Xue Yue not far away; his eyes lit up as an idea occurred to him.

"Xu Wei." He moved his Divine Sense and sent a voice to Xu Wei.

"Young Master, what are your orders?" Xu Wei trembled all over, seemingly fearful, and hurriedly replied.

"Do you see Xue Yue?"

"This old servant certainly sees him."

"Good—go and kill him!" Zi Donglai said coldly.

"What?" Xu Wei's face distorted with shock. "Kill… kill him? Young Master, he is…"

He was the future successor of the Hengluo Commerce Guild. Even a renegade cultivator like Xu Wei wouldn’t dare act recklessly against Xue Yue. Otherwise, even if he hid himself inside the Abandoned Nest, Chairman Ai Ou would find a way to drag him out and make him wish he were dead! 

"What? Would you disobey my orders?" Zi Donglai's expression darkened.

“Your servant wouldn’t dare, Young Master, please quell your anger!” Xu Wei hastily admitted his mistake, his face turning deathly pale.

"Good. Actually I don't want you to truly kill him; with his foundation you might not succeed. Just go threaten Xue Yue and put on a show."

Xu Wei suddenly understood: "You mean to use an attack on Xue Yue to disturb Ni Guang's state of mind, so he cannot fully contest for the Everlasting Tree?"

"Just do as I say." Zi Donglai nodded slightly.

"Understood." Xu Wei felt relieved—so long as he did not have to actually murder Xue Yue it was manageable—and he fawned a little: "Young Master is indeed wise!"

"Go now." Zi Donglai urged impatiently.

Xu Wei subtly inclined his head and fixed his gaze on Xue Yue. Without a word, his Void King Realm domain erupted and enveloped the watching Xue Yue.

Xue Yue never expected someone to launch an ambush at such a time and place, much less a Void King Realm cultivator. Taken by surprise, the Domain wrapped her tightly; she choked and stooped a half step.
