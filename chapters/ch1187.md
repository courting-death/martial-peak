## Chapter 1187 — Obtaining the Fragmentary Map

Secret Treasures in the form of flying needles are rare, but undeniably powerful: flying needles are among the best tools for penetrating certain defenses, and they’re especially suited to piercing a warrior’s Saint Yuan.

No wonder a single streak of golden light nearly tore through the Vast Heaven Shield — it turned out to be such a thing, Yang Kai realized with a start.

In the brief moment he was stunned, the only surviving Quehe Sect disciple finally had enough time to react. The four of them had attacked together, yet three were slain in an instant. If not for Senior Brother Meng’s sneak attack diverting that man’s attention, he was certain he would already be dead as well.

He dared not stay in place; horror on his face, he exploded backward and fled more than thirty zhang. Before he could draw a breath of relief, a pitch-black rope suddenly descended over him, seeming to block all his escape routes and render him immobile.

With a whooshing sound the black rope coiled around him. Only then did he see clearly that the rope was forged of black flame. Thinking of Junior Brother Qi’s fate earlier, his face went deathly pale.

He opened his mouth but made no sound; the Demonic Flame not only reduced his flesh to ashes in moments, it even consumed his soul.

The Nether Heaven Lock of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique inherently binds souls—it’s a martial skill designed for capturing fleeing enemies—and paired with Yang Kai’s unique Saint Yuan, the Nether Heaven Lock’s power was reborn.

In the blink of an eye, none of the four attackers around Yang Kai survived; they were all annihilated.

Meng Hongliang’s eyes trembled violently, his face registering disbelief and panic.

The middle-aged man who had been meditating to heal rushed up beside Yang Kai at that moment.

He had darted forward the instant the four from Quehe Sect struck, intending to aid Yang Kai, but he found the fight left no room for him; by the time he arrived, all four were dead. Even Meng Hongliang’s sneak attack had failed.

The middle-aged man’s expression was little better than Meng Hongliang’s; the only difference was he did not fear Yang Kai—he simply scrutinized him as if he were looking at a monster.

Only now did he understand Yang Kai was no fool and needn’t hide behind the Yingyue Hall’s name for protection, for Yang Kai had the ability to slay everyone present.

“Could it be that you—” Meng Hongliang blanched and began to speak, but never finished. After those three words he hurriedly clasped his hands and stammered, “I, Meng, have committed many offenses; please do not blame me. What happened today is known to heaven and earth and to you and me; I will not reveal it to a third party. Please spare me!”

Saying this, he did not wait for Yang Kai’s reply and immediately fled, avoiding Yang Kai like a venomous snake. His face was all terror.

“Trying to run?” Yang Kai sneered coldly and thrust out a fierce palm. Things had come this far—how could he possibly let Meng Hongliang escape unscathed? Whether because of the man’s earlier hostility and killing intent, or simply to silence him, the moment Yang Kai recognized him, he had already decided that Meng Hongliang would not leave here alive. He had brought it on himself.

A colossal palm imprint descended from the sky, blotting out the heavens and the earth and the light before Meng Hongliang.

Within that palm radiated a world-destroying might. Meng Hongliang’s mind swam; a sense of death washed over him. He screamed and sent forth another spray of golden light from his hand.

Countless threadlike flying needles sliced through space with hissing sounds.

In an instant the golden light flared, and the needles converged mid-flight into a long sword whose tip shivered as it drove toward the Heaven-Covering Palm’s imprint.

There was a thunderous boom...

The golden light dimmed, but the Heaven-Covering Palm seemed to have been pierced through with a hole. The overwhelming might that blanketed heaven and earth instantly weakened, and Meng Hongliang seized the chance to break free from that crushing restraint, fleeing at full speed.

He hadn’t moved ten zhang when a scorching, malevolent aura struck from behind. Meng Hongliang twisted to look and his blood ran cold—somehow the enemy had already appeared behind him, a black-fire-wreathed longsword slanting toward him.

His body felt as if it were burning, but even stronger was the terror of that sinister power. Meng Hongliang finally understood why that Junior Brother Qi had been so panic-stricken before his death.

He looked down and saw a black sword tip protruding from his chest; from that wound the raging flames spread rapidly throughout his body...

Before Meng Hongliang’s corpse had even finished burning, Yang Kai snatched his Spatial Ring and eagerly probed it with his Divine Sense, then laughed with great delight.

There wasn’t much of value in Meng Hongliang’s ring; it was similar to the three Xie Family men Yang Kai had slain earlier—mostly restorative pills and Saint Crystals, plus a dozen or so fire crystal stones of varying sizes.

But there was another crystal in Meng Hongliang’s ring that emanated searing heat.

It wasn’t a fire crystal from a fire spirit beast but a Fire-Glow Crystal Core—material of the Void King-Grade. Fire-Glow Crystals exist in Origin-Grade as well; based on quality there are lower, middle, and upper tiers.

The hill Yang Kai had visited earlier must conceal a vein of Fire-Glow Crystals beneath it.

Mining veins of Fire-Glow Crystals occasionally yield a tiny chance of producing a Fire-Glow Crystal Core—a higher-tier first-grade material.

Judging by the quality of this Fire-Glow Crystal Core, it was only a lower-level Void King-Grade specimen, but even so it was rare on Dark Star. No wonder Meng Hongliang had fought the middle-aged man for it and even killed to silence witnesses.

Yang Kai casually tossed the Fire-Glow Crystal Core into his ring and withdrew a fragmentary map.

What truly delighted Yang Kai was this fragmentary map—the same map fragment that had appeared at the Jubao Tower auction!

Back then the fragment had been bought by someone at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, who slipped away before the auction ended and was trailed by many. Eventually the fragment ended up with a youth—Meng Hongliang.

At first Yang Kai hadn’t remembered Meng Hongliang’s face; it only seemed familiar, but soon he recalled the events outside Tianyun City.

When Meng Hongliang took the fragment, Yang Kai had little hope—the place the map pointed to might not be found, and whether anything good lay there was uncertain. He thought it wasn’t worth wasting time and energy over an uncertain fragment.

Yet Yang Kai never expected the fragment would change hands so many times and finally fall into his own possession.

Yang Yan held another fragment; if the two pieces were pieced together they might reveal clues to be searched for later—there could yet be opportunity.

As Yang Kai rifled through the man’s Spatial Ring, the middle-aged man watched aghast—what Yang Kai did now was no different from a robber.

Yang Kai didn’t care; killing for treasure was all too normal. When Yang Kai finished, the weakened man staggered forward and clasped hands, saying, “I am Huang Xiran of the Jidao Sect; I thank this friend for intervening. Were it not for you, I would have perished. Please accept my bow.”

Saying so, he bowed to Yang Kai with utmost respect.

“A small thing; you flatter me, Brother Huang.” Yang Kai cheerfully helped him up.

Relief and sorrow both showed on Huang Xiran’s face as he lowered his voice: “It’s only right. Had you not acted, my Junior Brother’s grievance could not have been avenged; perhaps the world would never know that Meng Hongliang killed us.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. “How could you have been so careless to let him learn of the Fire-Glow Crystal Core?”

Hearing this made Huang Xiran even more gloomy. He forced a bitter smile and explained, “We were careful. My Junior Brother and I were lucky to find an area with abundant Fire-Glow Crystals, and shortly after you left we even extracted a Fire-Glow Crystal Core. We hid it carefully and set out at once. On the way we encountered Meng Hongliang, who had learned of the site. Seeing the crowd on the hill, he resorted to robbery, demanding we let him inspect our rings. The core was in my Junior Brother’s ring; my Junior Brother refused, and Meng Hongliang killed him without further words. The core fell into his hands. I could not stand against him and had to flee. I’m ashamed to say it.”

“I see.”

Calamities that befall men without warning—this was such a matter; it was no one's fault but fate’s misfortune.

“You haven’t even told me your family name!” Huang Xiran clasped hands solemnly. Yang Kai had saved him and avenged him; Huang Xiran was naturally grateful and wished to befriend so formidable a warrior.

“Yang Kai.”

“So you are Brother Yang—could it be that you are—” Huang Xiran hesitated, then gave a start and laughed awkwardly, “Pardon my rudeness, Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai looked at him oddly, puzzled.

Meng Hongliang had said something similar earlier; now Huang Xiran had repeated it—did they both share the same misunderstanding about who he was?

Yang Kai didn’t trouble himself with it and asked, “Brother Huang, what do you plan to do now?”

Huang Xiran thought seriously and replied, “I should find a place to heal. In my current state I cannot venture deeper into the Heat-Flame Zone; going on would only worsen my condition. I’ll rest until I recover and then see. Brother Yang needn’t worry about me—I can contact other sect-mates; there may be other Senior and Junior Brothers nearby.”

“That will do.” Yang Kai nodded and clasped hands. “If so, I’ll take my leave first.”

“By all means, Brother Yang! If opportunities present themselves in future, you are welcome at Jidao Sect; I will receive you humbly!”

Yang Kai gave a faint smile, noncommittal, and strode off toward the heaven-and-earth treasure area.

Watching Yang Kai’s retreating figure, Huang Xiran felt an inexplicable stirring. Like Meng Hongliang, he took Yang Kai for someone from that place—only someone from there could, he thought, as a First Stage of the Saint King Realm, slay five opponents far above him so easily.
