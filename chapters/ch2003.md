## Chapter 2003 — Golden Crystal Grass

Five days after entering the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, on the first level Yang Kai drifted down from the air with a calm, indifferent face, landing beside the two other martial artists and staring at the four demonic beast corpses on the ground—one large, three small.

Unlike Yang Kai's indifference, the other two martial artists were extremely excited.

These two men, one clad in blue and the other in white, were both male and both cultivated to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

The three did not exchange full names, only their surnames, and the reason they had gathered here was simply a temporary alliance.

After parting ways with Qin Yu, Yang Kai had been searching for the entrance to the second layer, and unexpectedly encountered these two martial artists here; the two appeared and briefly explained the situation to Yang Kai.

Only then did Yang Kai learn that the two had discovered some rare Golden Crystal Grass, but four Iron-Armed Shenni guarded it; the Iron-Armed Shenni possessed skin as hard as iron, astonishing natural defenses and tremendous strength. The two had already fought them and could not gain the upper hand, so they withdrew and planned to find another hand to help deal with the four demonic beasts.

By chance Yang Kai passed by and stepped forward to join them.

After hearing their explanation, Yang Kai immediately decided to join the party.

Although he did not know exactly what Golden Crystal Grass was, if it haunted two Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivators, it must be extraordinary in value.

Besides, it was only four demonic beasts; it should not take too long.

Furthermore, the two Third Stage of the Void King Realm practitioners did not worry him much — even if they had schemes, Yang Kai felt his present strength was sufficient to handle them.

After some questioning, Yang Kai discovered that Golden Crystal Grass was a rare spiritual herb that could help a martial artist temper the body; even if ingested and refined directly, it could greatly increase a cultivator's bodily strength and defenses, and if combined with other medicinal materials to refine into a Golden Crystal Pill, the effects were even better.

It was precisely because of Golden Crystal Grass that the Iron-Armed Shenni gathered and made their home here.

The three men conferred and then set aside courtesy, launching an attack.

Of the four Iron-Armed Shenni, the largest had reached the Tenth-Tier peak, equivalent to the pinnacle of the Void King Realm; given time it would not be difficult for it to ascend to the Eleventh-Tier. The other three, smaller in size, were nearly of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

If they had been ordinary demonic beasts, the two men could have handled them; at worst, they could have fought to a draw.

But the Iron-Armed Shenni's defenses were astonishing, its strength boundless, and its reckless fearlessness in battle had already caused the two men a great deal of pain in their earlier skirmish.

However, with Yang Kai's participation the situation changed completely.

Although Yang Kai concealed the true extent of his strength, he had no problem restraining that large Iron-Armed Shenni.

The other two combined their efforts, bringing forth the full array of Secret Treasure techniques to slay the three small ones, and then the three of them attacked together until even the last large one could not escape their lethal hands.

"Brother Yang is truly remarkable; even beneath this wretched beast you moved with complete ease and emerged unscathed — Zhao admires you," the man in blue said, his smile sounding somewhat forced.

"Indeed, this somewhat larger Iron-Armed Shenni nearly caused Zhao and I grievous injuries earlier. I did not expect Brother Yang to wrestle with it so long — Sun is ashamed," the man in white added.

"You flatter me; I only relied on a bit more nimble footwork. Although it had enormous strength, I avoided prolonged entanglement, so it couldn't really deal with me," Yang Kai said coolly.

Zhao and Sun exchanged a glance and said nothing further, letting the matter pass with a laugh.

After all, when the three had united against the final Iron-Armed Shenni, they had witnessed Yang Kai's performance; it had not been merely nimble footwork...

For a time, both men harbored a degree of apprehension toward Yang Kai.

"Now that these four beasts are dead, we should process them. The Essence-Blood, pelts, and teeth of Iron-Armed Shenni are all excellent materials and must not be wasted," proposed the man surnamed Zhao.

"Exactly. Especially their pelts — they are most suitable for refining defensive Secret Treasures," the man surnamed Sun added with obvious delight.

Without further hesitation the three set to work, each displaying methods to process the four Iron-Armed Shenni.

Before long they all wore expressions of satisfaction, each taking an equal share of the materials and leaving only some bloodied flesh and bones on the spot.

"Then now only the Golden Crystal Grass remains. I wonder how many stalks there are; I hope there are plenty," Zhao cast a heated gaze toward a cavern ahead.

"We will know once we enter," Yang Kai smiled slightly and strode forward, taking the lead into the cave.

Zhao and Sun exchanged looks and hurriedly followed.

The cave was dark and damp, with a nauseating odor that made one nearly retch; near the entrance lay many other demonic beasts' skeletons, white and brittle, and each step produced a crunching sound that sent chills down one's spine.

The four Iron-Armed Shenni had clearly made their home here.

After a short distance the three reached the cave's bottom.

Ahead there stood a stone pedestal about five zhang across, upon which grew a dozen or so small grasses emitting a metallic luster, each only two fingers in length.

The three extended their Divine Sense and, finding no danger, approached the stone pedestal.

"Tsk tsk, there are thirteen stalks," the man surnamed Zhao said with delight.

"Not easy to divide," the man surnamed Sun frowned, seeing the problem.

Yang Kai chuckled, "There are thirteen stalks, so the three of us each take four. As for the remaining one, let's convert it into its equivalent Source Crystal value—whoever takes the Golden Crystal Grass can compensate the other two with that amount."

"Good thinking, Brother Yang; we'll do that," Zhao and Sun readily agreed.

The three then divided the twelve stalks one by one, and after some discussion the final stalk was purchased by Yang Kai for five thousand Source Crystals.

After the bustle, all were pleased with the outcome.

"Our cooperation was pleasant — I hope we have another chance," Zhao bowed with a smile to Yang Kai.

"Indeed, Brother Yang's strength is impressive; I sincerely hope we can cooperate again," Sun also said.

"Perhaps," Yang Kai replied perfunctorily. "Since things are settled here, I will take my leave."

"If fate allows, we shall meet again, Brother Yang!" Zhao and Sun both cupped their fists in reply.

Yang Kai nodded and turned to leave.

Upon reaching the cave mouth he suddenly turned and asked, "Will you two not search for the entrance to the second layer?"

Zhao chuckled, "Of course we will, but after that fierce contest I expended much; I plan to recover here awhile, Brother Yang, you go first."

Sun indicated he had the same intention.

Yang Kai showed understanding and nodded without further comment, then left the cave while the other two sat cross-legged, took recovery pills from their Spatial Rings into their mouths, and closed their eyes to regulate their breathing.

For a time the cave fell silent.

After a long while Sun suddenly opened his eyes and murmured, "He should be gone far enough by now."

"It's been so long — do you think he still lurks nearby?" Zhao replied.

"Zhao, just now you told me not to act rashly. Golden Crystal Grass is so rare; he walked off with five stalks for nothing, and looking at him bid for it, he seemed to carry a fair amount of Source Crystal on him. If we could kill him..."

"You think we together are no match for him?" Zhao snorted upon hearing that.

"What? Although he performed well and concealed his strength, haven't we both done the same? Two against one — why fear him?" Sun retorted, unwilling to accept it.

"That is because you don't know how terrifying he is!" Zhao said. "Remember when I told you I came from the Dragon Ascension Altar? I saw this man personally slash Kui Sha to death with a single blow. Kui Sha had no chance to resist in his presence."

"Kui Sha? The Kui Sha of the Hua Xue Sect?" Sun exclaimed in surprise.

"Yes. Do you think we compare to Kui Sha?"

"Naturally not. Although the Hua Xue Sect is not the most formidable, slightly inferior to the Blazing Fire Hall, I've still heard of Kui Sha."

"That's why I didn't let you act. When I first saw him I couldn't recall, but when I witnessed his strike I realized it was that very man. If he could kill Kui Sha with one stroke, even the two of us together would not be his match; we would be in grave danger."

"I see — thanks for the timely reminder, Brother Zhao. Had we quarreled with him..." Sun broke into a cold sweat.

"Enough of that. Luckily this man seems unworldly; he didn't even know what Golden Crystal Grass is and casually probed us — amusing indeed."

"Yes, he's strange. With such power, how could he not even know of Golden Crystal Grass?" Sun was puzzled.

"All the better for us. It's to our advantage — since he doesn't know Golden Crystal Grass, he wouldn't know that such herbs grow only where rare minerals gather. In other words, there are rare mineral deposits underground here!" Zhao smiled.

"Now that he's gone, we should act quickly. If we find Imperial-Grade mineral, we'll be rich."

"Imperial-grade minerals aren't so easy to find — rumor says they only show up in the Star Sea. This is just the first layer of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda. Still… if there's even Dao Origin-grade ore here, I'll be perfectly satisfied."

Without further hesitation the two men set their plans in motion, unleashing their arts toward the spot where the stone pedestal stood. In hardly any time they had blasted a great pit into the ground; then their hands shifted, shaping their power into a dozen different techniques as they continued to claw and dig downward without pause.

"Sure enough something's off!" From not far away Yang Kai, who had used the secret art Nothingness to conceal his breath and presence, snorted coldly.
