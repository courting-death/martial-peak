## Chapter 124 — The Decision of the Three Sects

The crowd buzzed with lively discussion, the noise overwhelming. Yet, all were held back by the formidable experts of the three sects, who formed a large circle around the very center of the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area, keeping everyone at least a hundred zhang away.

Yang Kai fixed his gaze inward and saw the five great elders of Lingxiao Pavilion engaged in a heated debate with a group of people. Their argument seemed fierce and contentious, their faces flushed with anger.

Among them, a burly man was especially agitated, spitting wildly as he spoke, while a scholarly-looking middle-aged man tried to calm him with gentle words.

Nearby, whispers floated through the air. “That bear-like man is Hu Man, an enforcer of the Blood Battle Gang. The scholar is Xiao Ruohan, the Tower Master of Fengyu Tower.”

“What exactly is happening here? Why have all the experts from the three sects gathered?”

“Heh, I arrived early and came from a shorter distance. I overheard the masters saying that an Inheritance Celestial Cave has appeared here!”

“An Inheritance Celestial Cave? What is that?” The other clearly lacked knowledge on the matter.

Yang Kai himself was uncertain, so he pricked up his ears to listen carefully, as did many others around him.

The knowledgeable one smiled and began to explain the various benefits of an Inheritance Celestial Cave in detail. The crowd listened with fiery passion, their emotions stirred, longing to rush in and inherit the mantle of the great masters who had left behind such a treasure.

So that was it! Yang Kai suddenly recalled the unusual sensation he had felt here two months ago. At the time, he had only suspected some hidden Yang attribute treasure buried beneath, which was why he had sent Hu Mei’er to investigate.

But he had never expected that what lay beneath was actually an Inheritance Celestial Cave.

Back then, Yang Kai had sensed that the Yang energy was being blocked by something. Now he realized it must have been the sealing formation guarding the place.

This was an unexpected turn of events. In truth, the emergence of this Inheritance Celestial Cave bore a profound connection to Yang Kai—it was his inadvertent actions that had helped bring it forth.

The informed man continued to chatter on, but Yang Kai no longer paid attention. Instead, he pondered how the three sects’ experts would respond to this discovery.

No single faction could possibly claim it alone. Even if one wished to, the other two would never allow it.

The Blood Battle Gang was undoubtedly such a faction.

Thus, the most likely outcome was that the Blood Battle Gang would compromise, and the three sects would jointly explore the secrets within. However, the Blood Battle Gang would surely demand some initial benefit, as it was their discovery after all.

As Yang Kai contemplated, the three sects’ experts seemed to reach an agreement. Each summoned a highly skilled disciple to enter the Inheritance Celestial Cave first and scout the situation.

From Lingxiao Pavilion came Su Yan; from the Blood Battle Gang, Long Jun; and from Fengyu Tower, Fang Ziqi.

The three approached the enormous pit and leapt down together.

A long wait ensued.

Half a day later, Su Yan was the first to return. She suddenly appeared beside the pit and walked over to the gathered experts, reporting her findings.

Soon after, Long Jun and Fang Ziqi also returned.

After hearing their reports, the three sects’ experts held another urgent discussion before nodding to each other and dispersing in three directions.

Not long after, summons for their disciples echoed through the air.

Yang Kai, along with a group of Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, made their way toward the five great elders. The three factions kept to their own groups, avoiding interference with one another.

“Senior Brother Yang!” Just as Yang Kai waited for Wei Xitong to speak, Su Mu led Li Yuntian and others over.

“You’ve come too?” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Su Mu chuckled, “Such a momentous event, of course we must come to witness the excitement.”

Li Yuntian asked, “Senior Brother, where did you go these past twenty days? You disappeared without a trace.”

Yang Kai explained, “I was out handling some matters. I also owe thanks to you juniors for tidying up my wooden hut.”

Li Yuntian and the others were stunned. “We only swept the floor; the hut wasn’t really cleaned!”

“That’s because you’re a lazy bunch who don’t even fold your blankets when you get up. How would you bother cleaning the hut?” Su Mu laughed.

“Is that so?” Yang Kai’s thoughts stirred. Why then was his hut so neat and spotless?

“Silence! All silence!” Wei Xitong suddenly called out sternly. Nearly two thousand Lingxiao Pavilion disciples immediately quieted, all eyes turning expectantly toward him.

Everyone knew that what the great elder was about to say must relate to the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

Indeed, Wei Xitong cleared his throat and surveyed the crowd before speaking: “You should already know what has occurred here, and understand the nature of this opportunity. Inheritance Celestial Caves have been spoken of for ages, but not only have we elders never seen one, even the entire Han Dynasty in a thousand years has never produced such a place. We do not know the level of cultivation required to forge an Inheritance Celestial Cave, but… it is truly a treasure trove rivaling a kingdom! Within lie miraculous pills, secret cultivation techniques, rare treasures, and most importantly, the inheritance of a great master!”

The disciples murmured in astonishment, their eyes burning with fervor, their breaths quickening.

Wei Xitong continued, “Yet alongside these riches lie countless hidden formations and dangers. One misstep, and death or annihilation will be your fate!”

His words were like a bucket of cold water, dampening many eager hearts.

“Benefits are not given freely,” Wei Xitong snorted coldly. “To enter is to court death! I ask you all: knowing this, do you still wish to enter?”

Silence filled the hall. Wei Xitong’s piercing gaze swept over the disciples, narrowing sharply when it landed on Yang Kai before moving on.

After a moment, a voice spoke up: “Great Elder, such a rare opportunity must not be missed! Though perilous, we are willing to risk our lives to venture inside!”

“Yes! Such a chance may never come again in a lifetime. How could we let it slip by?”

“We want to enter!”

The Lingxiao Pavilion disciples grew excited, many stirred beyond reason. Under the allure of the Inheritance Celestial Cave, dangers and formations were no longer concerns. As the saying goes, men die for wealth, birds perish for food—an eternal truth.

“Very well!” Wei Xitong nodded with satisfaction. “Lingxiao Pavilion disciples should be fearless in the face of danger, their blood boiling with courage! I am pleased by your resolve.

“All disciples over thirty years old, step forward!”

A large group of disciples stepped out, instantly reducing the number by about forty percent.

Wei Xitong looked at them regretfully. “You cannot enter the Inheritance Celestial Cave. This place forbids those over thirty years old, and also those above the Divine Roaming Realm.”

“Why is that?” The group immediately grew disheartened.

“Silence! This formation was left by a senior master, and these rules were set by him. He must have had his reasons,” Su Xuanwu, the second elder, interjected sharply. Though he and the great elder were often at odds, this matter concerned the future and interests of Lingxiao Pavilion, so he would not undermine him now.

Wei Xitong called out again, “Disciples below the Open Origin Realm, step forward!”

Another group stepped out.

“You may qualify to enter, but you are forbidden to go!” Wei Xitong’s voice grew grave. “The dangers inside are too great for your strength. To enter is to invite death.”

This group accepted the judgment with humility, offering no complaints.

After these two rounds of selection, only three to four hundred remained.

Wei Xitong addressed the remaining disciples: “If any among you hesitate to enter, you may leave now. The sect will not force you. All is voluntary. Life or death, do not blame others!”

No one left. Who could resist the temptation of an Inheritance Celestial Cave?

After a long pause, Wei Xitong smiled. “Since you have chosen to enter, I will share what we have learned about this place, so you may prepare yourselves mentally.”

Su Yan and the others had only explored briefly, so their knowledge was limited but sufficient to prevent the disciples from being caught unawares.

Yang Kai listened carefully and learned that although the Inheritance Celestial Cave had only one entrance, each person appeared in a different location inside. The realm’s energy was abundant, ideal for cultivation.

Moreover, there were special exits within the realm. If danger was sensed, disciples could use these to escape.

Because Su Yan and the others had only scouted for a short time, Wei Xitong did not have much more to say.

Finally, he stated, “Since the Blood Battle Gang discovered this place, they will send fifty people in first. Half a day later, Lingxiao Pavilion and Fengyu Tower disciples will enter. I must warn you: be wary not only of the formations and traps but also of disciples from the other two sects. Do not let yourselves be robbed of treasures you cannot enjoy!”

At these words, the crowd’s hearts tightened, visions of bloodshed and treasure theft flashing through their minds.

“Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, if you encounter each other inside, support one another and survive together! Is that clear?”

“Yes!” The disciples answered in unison.

“Dismissed. Find a place to rest. When the Blood Battle Gang begins, I will summon you again,” Wei Xitong said, waving his hand gently.

The three to four hundred disciples quickly dispersed to find quiet spots to meditate and recover.

Li Yuntian approached, his face drawn and envious as he looked at Su Mu and Yang Kai. “Young Master Su, Senior Brother Yang, I cannot enter!”

His cultivation was only Body Tempering – Ninth Stage, not yet reaching Open Origin Realm.

Su Mu laughed, “Who told you to be so lazy in your training? Serves you right! Look at Senior Brother Yang—diligent and hardworking, surpassing others. What stage are you now?”

He turned to Yang Kai for the answer.

“Seventh stage,” Yang Kai pinched his nose.

Su Mu and Li Yuntian stared at him as if he were a monster, stunned for a long moment before recovering, their faces marked by a deep blow.

“I’d better get back to training,” Su Mu said dejectedly.

“Senior Brother Yang, you should recover quickly. I won’t disturb you,” Li Yuntian said, taking his leave.

Yang Kai nodded and then found a quiet spot nearby. He sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began to conserve his energy, awaiting the moment to come.
