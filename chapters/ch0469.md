## Chapter 469 — A Small Trick

Meng Wuya’s strength and mystery exerted tremendous pressure on the three Blood Servants. They truly had no idea which faction in this world could produce such an expert.

This was not merely the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm—it was a supreme master hovering just a step away from breaking beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

Though the three Blood Servants said nothing, each secretly speculated about Meng Wuya’s origins, yet the truth remained shrouded in mist.

Seeing Yang Kai bring him here, Ying Jiu harbored some suspicions but betrayed no expression.

The Sealing Yuan Curse placed on himself was the handiwork of Yang Family’s Grand Elder Huang Jiuzhou. Even if Meng Wuya was powerful, it was unlikely he could do anything.

After all, Huang Jiuzhou stood beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, while Meng Wuya was only at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm—a vast gulf separated their levels.

“Shopkeeper Meng,” Yang Kai greeted.

Meng Wuya only nodded lightly, casting a curious glance at Ying Jiu and quietly uttering a soft “hmm.”

“Someone is imprisoning you?” Meng Wuya smiled as he looked at Ying Jiu.

Ying Jiu remained indifferent.

“Shopkeeper Meng, do you have any way to remove the seal on him?” Yang Kai sat down, poured himself a cup of water, and cleared his throat.

“I’ll take a look,” Meng Wuya said without refusal, then called to Ying Jiu, “Come here!”

Ying Jiu glanced at Yang Kai; receiving his silent permission, he reluctantly approached Meng Wuya.

Sensing his reluctance, Meng Wuya laughed softly, “Relax. I know you’ve got some skill, but you’re useless now. What’s the point of being on guard against me?”

As he spoke, he reached out and grasped Ying Jiu’s wrist.

The room grew quiet. Yang Kai lifted the water cup to his lips, anxious in waiting, unsure if Meng Wuya had the means.

Ying Jiu, however, remained calm, showing no hope.

After a long moment, Meng Wuya chuckled strangely, “Interesting. Whoever cast this imprisonment spell is indeed skilled.”

Ying Jiu muttered, “That was by my Yang Family’s Grand Elder Huang Jiuzhou!”

Meng Wuya scoffed, “I don’t care about Huang Jiuzhou or Huang Bazhou. I haven’t heard of them.”

Ying Jiu was about to argue, but Yang Kai raised his hand to stop him.

Ying Jiu’s rare impulse to debate revealed how deeply he revered Grand Elder Huang Jiuzhou and how unwilling he was to let others belittle him.

After all, Huang Jiuzhou was the only Blood Servant to have advanced to Grand Elder rank. All Blood Servants regarded him as their exemplar and life's goal.

Though Meng Wuya’s comment praised Huang Jiuzhou’s skill in imprisonment techniques, to Ying Jiu it sounded like the old man was too arrogant. Huang Jiuzhou was beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, yet Meng Wuya, a mere peak Divine Roaming master, dared to judge him?

“Shopkeeper Meng, can you or can you not?” Yang Kai leaned forward, his voice serious.

“I can,” Meng Wuya replied casually.

Ying Jiu’s eyes narrowed. Surprised and shocked, he looked at Meng Wuya as if he hadn’t expected such a confident answer.

Yang Kai secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He wasn’t sure what miraculous skills Meng Wuya possessed, but the old man always left a mysterious and eerie impression. Yang Kai had seen those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm—Lü Si, Yang Yinghao, the Yang Family’s Grand Elders—but none emanated as strong a presence as Meng Wuya.

Subconsciously, Yang Kai acknowledged that Meng Wuya was unfathomable, possibly more terrifying than some beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

Relieved by Meng Wuya’s answer, Yang Kai trusted it without further questioning.

“Can you remove it?” Ying Jiu asked shakily, unbelieving, thinking Meng Wuya was bluffing.

Meng Wuya glanced at him and nodded slightly.

“How long?” Ying Jiu continued.

Ying Jiu could remove the Sealing Yuan Curse himself, but it would take at least two months of unrelenting effort.

If Meng Wuya also needed that long, Ying Jiu figured it was better to tough it out himself. He had little fondness for this old man who spoke ill of Huang Jiuzhou and naturally didn’t want to owe him a favor.

Meng Wuya showed two fingers.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, lightly smiling, “Two months or twenty days?”

Though he asked, Yang Kai internally leaned toward the latter; subconsciously, he found twenty days reasonable for Meng Wuya to dismantle the Sealing Yuan Curse.

Ying Jiu cast a dubious look at Meng Wuya, puzzled.

“Two days,” Meng Wuya said calmly.

Yang Kai and Ying Jiu both showed stunned disbelief.

Yang Kai suddenly realized he had underestimated Meng Wuya’s abilities. Shopkeeper Meng was definitely far more complicated than he had imagined.

“Senior,” Ying Jiu inhaled deeply, a strange expression on his face. “It’s not that Ying Jiu despises you, but your words are a bit—”

“Arrogant?” Meng Wuya laughed lightly, sneering, “If this curse were on me, I’d shatter it with a snap of my finger. Only because it’s on you do I have to take two days. Actually, I know quite a bit about imprisonment and sealing techniques. This little trick is nothing.”

A little trick...

Yang Kai watched intently and noticed a slight twitch in Ying Jiu’s face, which made him suppress a smile. He cleared his throat and asked, “Shopkeeper Meng, you’re really confident…”

“If you’re not willing to try, then get lost. I don’t have time to waste talking to you. The door’s over there.” Meng Wuya snorted and glanced at Ying Jiu. “With your abilities, it’ll take at least two months to break this, so work hard yourself.”

Ying Jiu was deeply moved.

Two months to break the Sealing Yuan Curse was his assessment of his own power, but Meng Wuya saw it at a glance. This old man’s insight was sharp indeed.

Frowning, Ying Jiu solemnly clasped his hands, “Please, Senior, lend your aid. If I offended you earlier, please forgive me.”

Since it was only two days, everything would be revealed soon enough.

Ying Jiu was also curious if Meng Wuya was really as powerful as he claimed.

“Shopkeeper Meng, what do you—” Yang Kai smiled at Meng Wuya.

The old man impatiently waved a hand, “Enough, go. He’ll come to see you in two days.”

Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction, told Ying Jiu to be patient, and turned to leave.

Returning to the adjacent room, Xia Ningshang was nowhere to be seen. She had most likely returned to the alchemy room.

Sitting cross-legged on the bed, Yang Kai pulled something from his bosom.

It was a lock of black hair.

This was cut from the mysterious expert who had snatched the eighth Mystery-Grade treasure earlier today at Po Jing Lake.

No one had expected that this elusive and formidable expert was a woman!

Unbeknownst to others, within a day Yang Kai had clashed with her twice, but he had yet to catch a glimpse of her face, much to his irritation.

Her speed was incredible, and her infiltration techniques were uncanny. Right under everyone’s eyes, she snatched the eighth Mystery-Grade treasure. Yang Kai had no idea how she managed it, nor how she endured the treasure’s attacks and the Sealing Yuan Curse Huang Jiuzhou had placed, yet still escaped unharmed.

Liu Qingyao had sacrificed a Mystery-Grade treasure to break the Sealing Yuan Curse, but what about this woman?

What bothered Yang Kai even more was who this woman belonged to. Yang Wei, Yang Zhao, Yang Kang, Yang Shen, Yang Ying—all their shocked expressions flashed before him; none seemed aware of her identity, but it couldn’t be ruled out that one might be pretending.

After much thought, Yang Kai could find no leads and set the matter aside.

After a while, three treasures appeared before him—his greatest gains today.

Though he had seized nearly two hundred treasures, these three outweighed them all in value.

One was a palm-length tiny sword, cold to the touch, a Heaven-Grade Divine Soul Treasure.

Yang Kai carefully examined it and realized it was actually of upper-level Heaven-Grade quality! He smiled inwardly.

Divine Soul Treasures were naturally precious, harder to refine than other treasures.

A Heaven-Grade upper-level Divine Soul Treasure’s value rivaled that of an ordinary Mystery-Grade treasure.

Yet Divine Soul Treasures were difficult to refine, especially since Yang Kai had not yet formed his Sea of Consciousness.

Playing with it for a while, Yang Kai set it aside and turned to the other two treasures.

Among the other two, one was a mirror he had chosen. This mirror felt icy cold, but unlike the tiny sword’s soul-chilling cold, the mirror’s cold was bone-freezing enough to freeze the world.

Pouring True Essence into it, the mirror’s surface flickered with glorious light. Yang Kai suddenly saw a strange scene.

Through the mirror, he saw towering, majestic snow-capped mountains, heavy snow drifting from the sky, dressing the peaks in silver-white. The piercing wind howled, and the view was a blinding expanse of white purity.

Crackling sounds echoed—and the room’s temperature suddenly plummeted.

The bone-chilling aura stirred Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi, which instinctively resisted the cold.

This was a middle-level Mystery-Grade treasure.

At once, Yang Kai’s mind lit up, his expression changing.

He didn’t know the ranks of the other seven Mystery-Grade treasures but was sure that middle-level Mystery-Grade treasures were rare—at most one or two.

This mirror, which he had selected in advance, was indeed a middle-level Mystery-Grade treasure.

A single middle-level Mystery-Grade treasure was worth ten lower-level ones.

This was a truly profitable acquisition!

Yang Kai’s heart surged. He retracted his True Essence; the mirror’s glow vanished, as did the endless snowy mountain scene.

Before refining it, he had no idea what function the mirror served.

Setting aside the mirror, Yang Kai’s gaze fell on the last treasure.

It was the bone shield Liu Qingyao had thrown over.
