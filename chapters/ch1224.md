## Chapter 1224 — Driving People Out

The Battle Sky Alliance cultivator waved the fan in his hand; a snarling, ferocious wind dragon, full of intimidating momentum, immediately shot out from the fan. Accompanied by a high, piercing dragon cry, it darted dozens of zhang in an instant toward another cultivator standing foolishly in the valley with his face flushing red.

No one knew which faction that cultivator came from; he had been acting furtively a moment ago. He'd thought everyone was absorbed in comprehension and that this was the perfect chance to act secretly. He fancied himself somewhat versed in array formations and had been considering setting up an array near the valley so that when the Red Candle Fruit ripened, there would be some guarantee for claiming it.

What he hadn't realized was that someone here wasn't lost in comprehension but was watching the surroundings closely; the moment he made a move, a Battle Sky Alliance cultivator saw through it.

The roar snapped most cultivators to attention. Under all those gazes, the would‑be schemer was flushed with shame and had no time to explain before the enormous wind dragon charged up to him. The dragon's body was composed entirely of keen Wind Blades; it opened its maw, murderous intent boiling, ready to devour him.

The cultivator was no weakling — otherwise he could never have reached the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. He raised a hand and unleashed a crimson light that shot into the wind dragon's gaping mouth, even as his expression turned horrified and his body drifted backward.

With a thunderous boom, that crimson light — whatever sort of attack it was — detonated inside the wind dragon's belly, unleashing unimaginable power. Crimson radiance splashed outward; the wind dragon, as if it had acquired a corporeal form, blurred and then collapsed into pieces.

"How dare you strike back!" From the Battle Sky Alliance side, Qu Changfeng rose to his feet with a predatory sneer, stretching forth a hand and, from a great distance, reaching to seize the man.

An invisible force instantly bound the man, preventing him from retreating further.

The Battle Sky Alliance cultivator wielding the Secret Treasure that summoned the wind dragon saw his chance and chuckled; with another flourish of his great fan another fierce wind dragon leapt forth and, in the flash between thunder and lightning, lunged at the array‑layer and gaped to swallow him.

Screams rang out. Although the array‑layer also possessed the power of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, under the combined onslaught of Qu Changfeng and one of his fellow disciples he offered no effective resistance. He struggled briefly before being shredded into fragments by the countless Wind Blades inside the wind dragon.

The stench of blood filled the air. Limbs and gore littered the ground.

After Qu Changfeng and his companion finished killing the man, their gazes immediately turned to a certain hillock, eyes cold and hostile.

On that hillock stood three Saint King Realm cultivators with sullen faces; one stepped forward as their leader and shouted, "Qu Changfeng, what are you doing? Even if one of our Wei Huo Alliance disciples did something wrong, it's not for you to kill him. Are you trying to provoke a dispute between the Battle Sky Alliance and the Wei Huo Alliance?"

"Ha, provoke a dispute?" Qu Changfeng sneered bitterly. "Don't pin some grand accusation on me — you're not worthy of it. Why don't you ask whether your Junior Brother was sneaking around setting up an array and whether the others approved?"

The speaker turned and looked around, only to see every cultivator on the hillock glaring at him with hostile eyes. He sank inward, realizing his fellow's actions had indeed provoked the crowd's wrath.

The Red Candle Fruit was about to ripen, and someone had the nerve to secretly lay down an array to grab the advantage — how could that be tolerated?

So even if Qu Changfeng's reputation was poor and his character disagreeable, at this moment everyone stood with him — or, rather, each person was defending their own interest.

After a low command from Qu Changfeng, many cultivators on various hillocks rose to their feet, and there was the faint sense that they would press their attack.

The three Wei Huo Alliance men turned ashen and dared not argue further; they knew this place no longer held room for them. Besides hating Qu Changfeng's ruthlessness, they were also filled with remorse.

Their comrade had gone out to set the array only after everyone had discussed and agreed; they'd all thought this was a good opportunity for forming an array, but they hadn't expected to be exposed so quickly and to find themselves in such a disadvantageous position.

If they didn't leave now, they feared they would truly be hunted down and killed.

With that thought, the Wei Huo Alliance disciple nodded and said, "Fine, Qu Changfeng — I'll remember you. For killing my comrade, the debt will be repaid one day. As for all of you who aided him, your fate will likely be the same. Heh, you'd better take care of yourselves... We're leaving!"

Saying that, he abruptly led his two fellow disciples away at speed without looking back.

Qu Changfeng was a little surprised to see them leave so decisively, but he wasn't foolish enough to pursue them. This was not the time to chase; their earlier success in slaying that person at a moment's notice had been by surprise. With three of their own remaining, it was unrealistic to try to kill them all.

They were all Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — even with differences in strength between them, they were not soft targets to be toyed with.

With a sullen look, Qu Changfeng swept his gaze around and arrogantly declared, "If anyone dares to do more underhanded business, don't blame me for being ruthless. The rare treasure will soon surface; I hope everyone follows the rules and competes by strength. If not, don't blame me for acting harshly."

No sooner had he spoken than someone shouted, "Young Qu, I just saw that guy sneak something out — looks like he had ill intent!"

"Who?" Qu Changfeng's expression chilled as he stared at the speaker.

"The people from Wanshou Mountain!" the man answered without fear, pointing at five capable cultivators on a nearby hillock.

The five men paled and glared at the speaker with murderous hatred, but the accuser plainly meant to curry favor with Qu Changfeng and paid them no mind. He loudly declared, "I didn't see exactly what it was, but it should be some kind of stealthy Demonic Beast. Heh, Wanshou Mountain disciples excel at commanding Demonic Beasts — everyone knows that."

"Is that so!" Qu Changfeng nodded as if it were only natural, then coldly addressed the five Wanshou Mountain disciples: "Do any of you have anything to say?"

The leading burly man knit his brows and pondered for a moment, then suddenly smiled. "Young Qu, words without proof mean little — you wouldn't really believe this fellow on his sole say‑so, would you?"

He was evidently confident in his methods and certain he could not be seen through, so he felt no fear. Without evidence, could Qu Changfeng forcibly drive them away?

Yet as things had unfolded, everyone could see the Battle Sky Alliance was preparing to act early.

They couldn't kill or drive people away without cause, so they naturally sought some pretext. The Wei Huo Alliance disciple who'd been slain had it coming, he thought — who told him to go arrange an array? In losing his life, he had dragged other Wei Huo disciples into shame and forced them to leave.

Now those Wanshou Mountain disciples either truly had set a trick in motion or were being framed; no one spoke up for them.

In the current situation, the fewer people who stayed here the better. Most people took a mind‑your‑own‑business attitude and let Qu Changfeng rage, hoping he'd drive away even more.

Once fewer people remained, the difficulty of seizing the Red Candle Fruit would be reduced.

Hearing the burly man's words, Qu Changfeng frowned. Although he wanted to sweep the Wanshou Mountain people away regardless, without proof it would be unwise to act rashly.

"Do you think the Battle Sky Alliance is so powerful that other factions don't matter?" the burly man snapped. "If you think that, I, Hai, won't accept it — Wanshou Mountain is not someone you can bully easily." As he spoke, dozens of fist‑sized, jet‑black giant bees swarmed up around him, wings buzzing incessantly. There were over thirty of them; each tail glinted with a cold sheen, their sting several inches long and jet‑black — clearly venomous and bone‑chilling.

Not only that, the burly man surnamed Hai's companions also released the Demonic Beasts they commanded.

Those Demonic Beasts were rare species, each an Eighth‑Tier creature born with formidable lethal techniques. Some soared, some crawled, and they clustered around the five Wanshou Mountain disciples, their blood‑red eyes staring viciously at the surroundings, ready to strike at their master's command.

"Bitter King Bees!" Qu Changfeng's face darkened when he saw the thirty‑odd giant bees; he revealed a look of unmistakable apprehension and gritted his teeth. "No wonder you're so confident — you've brought Wanshou Mountain's guarding giant bees. It seems Wanshou Mountain has really put its money down this time."

The burly Hai grinned and said, "Don't laugh at me, Young Qu. Wanshou Mountain disciples only know how to command Demonic Beasts — entering this Flowing Flame Sandland without something to protect our lives would be foolish. Hai doesn't want bad blood with you; if Young Qu has no solid evidence, please don't make things hard for Hai. Much appreciated!"

Although the Bitter King Bees gave Hai confidence, he wasn't looking to make a scene with Qu Changfeng. At this moment he spoke placatingly, giving both sides a way to back down — best to make a small thing smaller.

Qu Changfeng's brow remained knotted; it seemed he also didn't want to make trouble for the sake of trouble. With over thirty Bitter King Bees, forcing the issue now would certainly incur losses on his side.

But before he could reply, a soft, tinkling laugh suddenly rang out: "If you want proof, that's simple — let me see and you'll know."

All eyes turned toward the hillock held by Liuli Sect, where Yin Sudie rose with a captivating, dramatically startled smile. Her willow‑slender waist seemed boneless and graceful; in her delicate hand she held a pigeon‑egg‑sized, grayish round pearl.

The pearl looked ordinary and unremarkable, not at all precious.

But when Qu Changfeng saw that bead his eyes suddenly lit up and he couldn't help laughing heartily.
