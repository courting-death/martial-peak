## Chapter 1272 — Settling In

Daiyuan smiled, pressing her lips together, and asked with deliberate meaning, "How did it feel?"

Yang Kai's face flushed—rare for him—and he laughed awkwardly, "Not bad, not bad. No wonder Dark Star produced such a famed beauty; her skin is delicate and well cared for."

Seeing Yang Kai actually say such things, Daiyuan could no longer bear it; she gave a light tut and ceased that line of talk, leading Yang Kai and Yang Yan deeper into the mountain passage.

Once inside the corridor, Daiyuan pressed her hand to the stone wall. With Saint Yuan circulating, the jade pendant that had flown in earlier reappeared in her palm, and immediately the opened stone wall slid shut again without a sound.

"Please follow me," Daiyuan called ahead, guiding Yang Kai and Yang Yan as they threaded through the mountain passage.

After advancing roughly a hundred zhang, a vast cavern suddenly appeared, its area easily a thousand zhang across. It seemed the heart of Qianhuan Peak had been hollowed out to form it. The cavern was emptily sublime, without any trace of artificial carving. Yang Kai looked around in astonishment and realized this cavern was naturally formed, not dug by hand. Above the cavern hung dark-red molten pillars, some thick, some thin—like pointed cones poised to fall at any moment—extremely perilous.

Below, long pillars of molten rock rose as well, so that the whole cavern resembled a chaotic forest of stone, labyrinthine and bewildering.

"A natural formation array!" After sweeping her gaze over the pillars above and below, Yang Yan suddenly exclaimed, her bright eyes shining, and she halted in place.

"It truly can't escape Miss Yang Yan's eye," Daiyuan stopped as well, glancing back at Yang Yan with a touch of admiration. Then she began to explain, "Indeed, within the cavern of my Qianhuan Peak there exists a natural array, though it only possesses certain illusionary effects and not much destructive power."

Yang Yan continued to inspect the surroundings for a long moment before asking, "Someone later altered the natural array here?"

"Yes. It was someone who once lived on Qianhuan Peak…" Daiyuan's expression dimmed as if recalling something, the shadow quickly passing, and she continued, "That person had some understanding of array formations, so they modified this natural array. They made it not only capable of producing illusions, but also of repelling foes."

"May I go in and take a look?" Yang Yan inquired, clearly very interested in this natural array.

"Nonsense!" Yang Kai's face turned stern as he scolded Yang Yan.

No matter what, this was Daiyuan's grotto. The arrays set up outside it were her protection—how could anyone probe them at will? That would be a grave breach of etiquette.

Daiyuan only smiled faintly. "Junior Brother Yang, do not say that. Since Miss Yang Yan has some involvement in arrays, it's natural she's curious. After all, natural arrays are rare and difficult to come by. If Miss Yang Yan wishes to enter, she may. I myself am not very proficient with this formation—ever since the previous resident of this place passed away, though I live here now, I cannot manipulate the array. I only know one safe path in and out. If Miss Yang Yan can decipher this array and extract its essence to teach me, Daiyuan will be deeply grateful."

"I see." Yang Kai's expression cleared slightly. Since Daiyuan intended to make use of Yang Yan's talent, he could hardly keep pressing the matter. He turned to Yang Yan and asked, "Is that all right?"

Yang Yan curled her lips and gave no answer; she wrapped herself in her dark robe, blurred, and vanished among the molten pillars.

Yang Kai smiled wryly, knowing he'd underestimated Yang Yan and that she was just vexed by his slight.

Daiyuan's eyes brightened at Yang Yan's confident behavior; she looked on with secret hope.

“Let’s go, no need to worry about her. After all, this is your place—once she’s finished her study, she’ll naturally come out,” Yang Kai said to Daiyuan with a helpless smile.

"All right." Daiyuan had no objections and continued to lead Yang Kai through the maze of pillars.

Before long the two passed through the cavern and entered another mountain corridor. A short distance ahead they reached a stone chamber.

As soon as he entered the stone chamber, Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly. He discovered that the room was filled with rich pill and medicinal fragrances, and within the chamber stood five or six alchemy furnaces of various sizes.
Only then did he recall that Daiyuan was an alchemist.

Back when they were in the Flowing Flame Sandland, Wei Guchang had mentioned this. Daiyuan's familiarity with the Red Candle Fruit also stemmed from her being an alchemist.

However, since she had petitioned him for help, her alchemy level likely wasn't very high—Yang Kai understood this and didn't press the point.

“Please don’t laugh at me, Junior Brother Yang,” Daiyuan said with a gentle smile. “I’m afraid what little I have here is hardly worthy of your eyes.”

“Not at all, not at all. Your place here is truly something else—far better than back at Dragon Lair Mountain,” Yang Kai said with a light laugh.

"Junior Brother Yang…" Daiyuan suddenly called softly, her eyes fixed on him. "In the outside world, are there truly Void King-Grade alchemists?"

Yang Kai glanced at her and realized many on Dark Star seemed curious about the outside world; he had heard similar questions more than once.

He grew serious and nodded. "Yes, the outside world does indeed have Void King-Grade alchemists. I haven't personally seen them, but I've heard of them. There are also artificers of Void King-Grade, experts of the Void King Realm, and even figures like Star Lords."

"Star Lords!" Daiyuan's brows lifted. "Ones who, legend says, can refine a Stellar Origin and become the ruler of a star—warriors of tremendous power?"

"Yes, but such people are rare. I've heard refining a Stellar Origin is dangerous; even Void King Realm experts dare not try it lightly, else their souls might be scattered."

"Is that so…" Daiyuan smiled at his words, then cheerfully added, "If there's a chance, I'd like to learn of the marvels outside from Junior Brother Yang. Please don't refuse."

"All right, I'll tell you frankly when the time comes!" Yang Kai agreed offhand. Though he knew little of the Star Domain, he had at least come from beyond the Dark Star and so knew more than most here. Talking about such things wasn't a problem.

Daiyuan asked no more. She arranged for Yang Kai to rest in a room beside the chamber, apologized and told him to recuperate for a few days, then went to pay respects to her master.

After all, when she last left Liuli Sect she hadn't told anyone, and Yin Sudie had just come to inform her that her master wished to see her; she could not let her teacher wait.

Yang Kai waved her off and let her go.

Soon Daiyuan left Qianhuan Peak, becoming a streak of green light that vanished into the Taiqing Mountain Range.

Once Daiyuan had gone, Yang Kai opened his eyes from meditation. A glint of mischief crossed his gaze and, with a flourish of his hand, a figure appeared before him.

It was the Stone Puppet, standing there looking at Yang Kai with a dull expression as if waiting for orders.

"You know what to do, right?" Yang Kai asked.

The Stone Puppet cocked its head, thought for a moment, then nodded.

"Good. I'll tell you the location. Remember, if there's any danger or a chance of being discovered, return immediately—do not alert anyone!" Yang Kai instructed carefully, then reached out and pressed a finger to the puppet's brow.

A speck of green light passed from his fingertip into the puppet's skull. That glow contained a shard of Yang Kai's Divine Sense, with precise coordinates for Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain.

Since Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain is Liuli Sect's treasure, its protective arrays and forbiddances would be formidable. Though Yang Kai trusted the Stone Puppet, one must prepare for contingencies, hence the stern warning.

He did not want to lose the Stone Puppet over the theft of a little Thousand Illusions Glaze.

The Stone Puppet had been diligent since its creation—an exemplar of tireless, faithful service. Where else could one find such an assistant?

After the faint green imprint of Yang Kai's Divine Sense entered the puppet's head, it quickly faded. The puppet stood dumbly for a moment as though processing the information, then its eyes rolled. Without a sound it shook its body; a small hole opened in the ground and the puppet disappeared.

By the time Yang Kai noticed, the puppet had already descended a hundred zhang beneath the surface. It paused only briefly before racing swiftly and accurately toward the location of Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain.

The Stone Puppet was uniquely attuned to the earth; the ground could not obstruct its motion.

After sending the puppet out, Yang Kai smoothed the little hole back over so nothing showed on the surface, then resumed meditating with perfect nonchalance.

He still did not know why Daiyuan had invited him, but given her nature, she likely would not ask him to do anything too troublesome. If something truly onerous came up, he could refuse. His main purpose here had already been achieved, and all that remained was to wait for the Stone Puppet to return. With that thought he settled in to live here.

For three days Yang Kai saw no sign of Daiyuan.

Yang Yan, however, appeared like a specter, eyes glittering with excitement—she seemed to have made great progress studying the natural array. Yang Kai did not pry; he knew he would not understand even if told, so he left her to it.

With Daiyuan not returned, Yang Yan contented herself resting in the adjacent room.

After waiting in Qianhuan Peak for two more days, Daiyuan suddenly reappeared.

But Yang Kai found her strangely exhausted: her face was drooped, her eyes swollen and reddened from crying. Even when she forced a smile, the sorrow at the corners of her brow could not be erased.

Yang Kai had no idea what had befallen her to cause such a change; it must have something to do with her master—after all, Daiyuan had gone to see her teacher and returned in five days with this transformation, which was puzzling.
