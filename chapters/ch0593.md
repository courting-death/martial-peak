## Chapter 593 — Farewell to the Void Passage

Yang Kai's eyes lit up with joy and surprise. Although Shopkeeper Meng had said little, he could piece together some understanding.

Within Meng Wuya was a sealed presence. Because of the seal, he was only at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. If the seal could be lifted, he would be able to maintain the cultivation of the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

"Congratulations, Shopkeeper Meng," Yang Kai said happily, glad that Meng Wuya had found a chance to break the seal. It seemed that Evil Lord Yang Bai’s recent actions had also inadvertently brought some benefit to their side.

"Shopkeeper Meng, have you seen any signs of Yang Bai or the heads of the Eight Great Families?" Yang Kai hurriedly asked again.

Meng Wuya shook his head, then said, "If you want to find them, Xia Ningshang can help you."

Yang Kai quickly turned his gaze to his Senior Sister.

Xia Ningshang nodded lightly, saying nothing, and then waved her hand, releasing a bolt of energy. Swift as lightning, the energy vanished into the labyrinthine tunnels beneath the ground.

After a while, the energy returned.

Xia Ningshang casually pointed in one direction. Yang Kai grinned and immediately took a step toward the place she indicated.

"Yang Kai, I’ll stay behind to protect Shopkeeper Meng and Sister Xia," Su Yan hesitated before saying.

She wanted to act alongside Yang Kai because, up to now, all the dangerous affairs and battles had been borne by him alone. But seeing Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang busy with some critical matters without protection nearby made her uneasy.

Her staying would at least ensure the safety of the two if danger arose.

Yang Kai nodded, "Be careful."

"You as well," Su Yan smiled warmly.

After bidding farewell to Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai and Di Mo proceeded in the direction indicated by the Senior Sister, their overwhelmingly powerful Divine Sense probing their surroundings at all times.

Soon, some life presence registered in Yang Kai’s awareness. His spirit sharpened, leading Di Mo toward it.

Ahead were nine figures.

Eight of them were the family heads of the Eight Great Families, who had followed Evil Lord Yang Bai here. The remaining one was Yang Bai himself.

When Yang Kai and Di Mo arrived, the two sides were in a standoff.

Though the eight family heads had cultivation in the Transcendent Realm, their numbers notwithstanding, they dared not act rashly against someone like Evil Lord Yang Bai. The aura Yang Bai exuded was a tremendous pressure.

Yang Bai, however, looked calm, even slightly amused deep in his eyes. Although his skills were peerless, he was in no hurry to strike. Instead, he leisurely regarded the eight with a playful gaze.

When he saw Yang Kai and Di Mo suddenly appear, Yang Bai’s eyes brightened. He smiled, "Nephew has arrived as well. Not bad, not bad. Your Senior Uncle was just worrying that no one would witness this moment. More people are better."

Yang Kai snorted coldly and strode forward, eyeing Yang Bai gravely. "Senior Uncle, you went to great lengths, sacrificing all the experts of Cangyun Evil Land just to find this Earth Vein beneath Zhongdu City?"

"Exactly!"

"Why?" Yang Kai questioned. "This Earth Vein belongs to Zhongdu. Even if you find it, you won’t be able to drain its energy right away. It would only benefit the Eight Great Families. Senior Uncle isn’t foolish enough to make such a losing deal, right?"

Yang Bai’s face showed a teasing expression as he lightly nodded. "It seems Nephew is smarter than those eight. They all think I want to possess this Earth Vein’s energy, but they’re wrong. I don’t have the capability to absorb the Earth Vein’s energy right under everyone’s noses in Zhongdu, nor such grand ambition."

Yang Yinghao and the others’ expressions changed to confusion.

They had believed Yang Bai was after the Earth Vein’s energy, but now he denied it outright.

Then what was his real purpose?

"No matter your purpose, today will be your grave!" Yang Yinghao shouted coldly, cutting off Yang Bai’s rambling.

Yang Bai laughed lightly. "With you lot, you can’t make the move. If I wanted, I could take your lives anytime."

"Then why have you not acted yet?" Yang Kai sneered.

"I told you, I need witnesses. Shan Qingluo was the best choice. I planned to share this with her, but she didn’t appreciate it and missed such a good opportunity," Yang Bai said slowly, shaking his head in disappointment.

"Your interests are truly vile."

"Whatever," Yang Bai shrugged casually. "Because I am about to leave here for a higher world."

"A higher world?" The eight were stunned, not understanding his meaning.

Di Mo chuckled strangely. Yang Kai’s mind stirred.

"Ignorant," Yang Bai showed a hint of pity. "You think beyond Divine Roaming is the pinnacle of martial cultivation? You’re wrong. Beyond Divine Roaming is not the peak, and it’s not even called 'beyond Divine Roaming.' That’s just the name you gave it."

The eight family heads were shocked, as if hearing something tremendous, eagerly waiting to understand what exactly was beyond Divine Roaming.

"It is called the Transcendent Realm, a realm beyond mortal limits," Yang Kai interrupted with disdain, cutting off Yang Bai’s showmanship. He shook his head, "Senior Uncle, I thought you were someone of substance, but now it seems you’re nothing more than a clown."

Yang Bai’s eyes cooled, surprised that Yang Kai also understood the realm. Then, he appeared composed again and nodded. "Brother, I guess your companion told you."

Di Mo chuckled enigmatically, gazing at Yang Bai with equal ridicule.

Yang Bai’s lecturing about the Transcendent Realm was no match for Di Mo.

Looking at Di Mo, Yang Bai spoke sincerely, "Brother, actually you and I share the same origin. My achievements come from the body you now possess. We should be closer. If you agree, why not join forces?"

"No thanks," Di Mo chuckled. "I find following the Young Master more promising."

"Do you really believe that?" Yang Bai looked disappointed. "That nephew of mine has extraordinary talent, but even so, his achievements will likely be bound here. If you join me, I can show you a broader world."

As he spoke, Yang Bai suddenly slapped the cave wall beside him. His fierce True Yuan poured in, and the Earth Vein’s energy immediately began to stir, converging rapidly.

In a moment, a small black dot appeared at the spot he struck. It quickly expanded, and in just a few breaths, turned into a black hole several zhang across.

Deep and terrifying, it seemed able to swallow everything.

The family heads’ faces turned pale in confusion, hastily retreating, none understanding what this black hole was.

Only Yang Kai and Di Mo’s eyes almost popped out as they shouted in unison, "Void Passage?"

Yang Bai looked at them in surprise, not expecting them all to recognize this thing. He nodded, "Correct, it is the Void Passage. On the other side is a higher-level world, vastly different from this one. This place is a barbaric land, starved of heavenly energy and sparse in strong cultivators. Over there, the heavens’ energy is abundant, cultivating the Dao of martial arts more easily, with endless powerful figures. Brother, if you agree, I am willing to let you enter with me and share those resources."

"I see!" Di Mo nodded seriously. "It looks like not only did you inherit this body’s legacy, but also its memories."

"Yes!" Yang Bai nodded openly.

The corpse of the Demonic Master beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine in Lingxiao Pavilion was now possessed by Di Mo, serving as his body. But before that, Yang Bai inherited the legacy and thoughts from this corpse. This was how he understood the secrets of the Transcendent Realm and rapidly improved his strength.

It must have been the memories hidden within the Demonic Master’s corpse that guided Yang Bai to the Earth Vein beneath Zhongdu and the Void Passage’s location.

His aim was not Zhongdu or the Earth Vein, but this Void Passage.

He wanted to transcend this world and enter another to pursue a higher realm and cultivation.

"But the memories you obtained seem incomplete," Di Mo said with a strange laugh.

"Why would you say that?" Yang Bai frowned slightly.

"Did you think resources over there are yours to take at will? Do you think the elites there are pushovers? A joke. Though this place is barbaric, the other side is also full of dangers. Your cultivation is good, so you can dominate here. But there, at best, you’d be just an elder within a sect. If I were you, I’d rather enjoy freedom here," Di Mo said calmly.

"How do you know so much?" Yang Bai was finally shocked. "Impossible. I have inherited all the remaining memories from that corpse. You couldn’t have gotten his thoughts."

"I don’t need his thoughts, because I come from that world myself!" Di Mo laughed wildly, pointing at himself. "The previous owner of this body would truly be my junior’s junior!"

Yang Bai’s face darkened. He stared at Di Mo like a monster, his eyes filled with deep fear.

It was by inheriting the Demonic Master’s legacy that he had achieved his current strength. Yet Di Mo claimed that the Demonic Master was his far junior, looking down on him. This overturned Yang Bai’s understanding entirely.

"Trying to deceive me?" Yang Bai’s expression turned cold. "No matter what you say, I won’t be fooled. Since we’ve come this far, I’ll see the other world with my own eyes."

Di Mo slowly shook his head. "You are the most ignorant one here."

"It’s none of your business to judge!" Yang Bai roared. Suddenly, his aura became dangerous, thick with malevolent demonic energy. His face twisted monstrously, as if a demon had descended, unstoppable and overbearing.

"Entering Demonic State!" Yang Kai touched his forehead. The mighty energy of his Proud Bone Golden Body surged fiercely, and tattoo-like demonic markings spread all over him. The intensity of his malevolent energy rivaled Yang Bai’s and even surpassed it in strength.
