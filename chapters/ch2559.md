## Chapter 2559 — Changing the Bell

Moreover, what could I possibly have that someone like Great Emperor Youhun would covet?

Myriad Sword? That can't be it...

Myriad Sword was decent, but it might not even catch Youhun's eye. He's a Great Emperor—what Imperial Treasure doesn't he have? Why would he bother with the Myriad Sword?

So what does he want to trade with me for? Yang Kai pondered over and over, but still couldn't figure out what Youhun was after.

"The thing the Lord wants to exchange... could it be this junior's life?" Yang Kai chuckled.

Elder Fu snorted, "A worthless life—what use would this Lord have for it?"

Yang Kai's face darkened. He didn't think his life was worth much, but being called worthless to his face was still unpleasant. If not for the other's status, he would've rushed up to fight him.

"Just say whether you agree or not." Elder Fu looked at Yang Kai with leisurely amusement, a mocking smile on his lips.

You won't even explain, so how am I supposed to agree? Do you really think I'm as dim-witted as your daughter? With a cold snort, Yang Kai said, "The Lord's words are unclear. Forgive me, but I can't accept."

The man before him was an ancient monster who'd lived for who knows how many years. Yang Kai didn't dare promise anything lightly, lest he fall into a trap and end up at the other's mercy.

Elder Fu said blandly, "This Lord wants to trade for your bell!"

At those words, Yang Kai's heart shook violently, his vigilance spiking.

Trade the bell? What bell could he mean? Aside from the Mountain and River Bell, Yang Kai didn’t have any other bells on him.

How did he know? In today's battle, Yang Kai hadn't used the Mountain and River Bell at all, and any enemies who'd seen it before were already dead. How could Great Emperor Youhun know about it?

Did he sense it? That didn't seem possible—the Mountain and River Bell had been refined by Yang Kai, and unless he brought it out, no one should be able to sense it.

Yet this old man spoke with such certainty, as if he was sure Yang Kai had the Bell. Yang Kai couldn't tell if he was bluffing or truly confident.

Could he be planning to kill and steal? Yang Kai secretly bared his teeth. If the Great Emperor Youhun really had that idea, things would get ugly for him.

"What bell? What does the Lord mean!" Yang Kai's mind raced, but his face remained blank, feigning confusion.

Elder Fu looked at him with a teasing smile, coldly snorting, "Do you truly not know, or are you just pretending?"

Yang Kai naturally didn't dare show any weakness. Gritting his teeth, he said, "Please enlighten me, Lord. I truly don't understand what you're talking about."

Secretly, he swore to himself: if this old man brought up the bell again, he'd send his daughter off first.

But Elder Fu said, "If that's the case, this Lord won't force you."

As he spoke, Emperor Yuan wrapped around Lin'er, and they swept away, vanishing into the Ancient Land's passage in the blink of an eye.

He really just left. So decisive, not giving Yang Kai any time to react.

"Damn it! If you're not giving me the Jade Cinnamon Bowl, at least give me some Source Crystals or something. I took this beating for nothing!" Only after a while did Yang Kai react, cursing furiously.

He'd really lost out this time. Lin'er had made trouble for him again and again, even teaming up with the Netherworld Sect to threaten his life. Yet all he'd done was force Youhun into Soul Descent for a bit of verbal sparring, and hadn't gained a thing...

But soon after, Yang Kai felt a cold, damp sensation spreading across his back.

Youhun's sudden mention of the Bell had truly startled him.

After glancing around warily, Yang Kai didn't dare linger. He walked over to the dead Netherworld Sect disciples, collected their Spatial Rings, and hurried into the Ancient Land.

Once out of the passage, he'd officially entered the Wild Ancient Land.

This was a region never completely explored. It was one of the most dangerous places in the entire Star Realm—even Emperor Realm cultivators couldn't guarantee their safety here.

Within this Ancient Land were countless dangers, many natural restrictions, and wild ancient remnants. All were deadly threats.

There were even rumors that Divine Spirits lived here, though no one knew if it was true.

Yang Kai hadn't gone a hundred li deeper before he noticed something strange about the Ancient Land.

A strange energy flowed through the air all around, subtly suppressing the strength of any cultivator who entered. The deeper Yang Kai ventured, the more pronounced this effect became.

Towering ancient trees reached into the clouds, and the ground was covered with all sorts of strange flowers and grasses Yang Kai had never heard of. An ancient, desolate aura swept over him.

Primordial Power!

The entire Wild Ancient Land was filled with this unique Primordial Power, the force from the Primordial Era when heaven and earth first opened. Under its pressure, all living beings felt insignificant. Any cultivator entering here couldn't use their full strength!

After sensing it for a while, Yang Kai found that this Primordial Power didn't suppress him at all.

When it invaded his body, it was like a gentle breeze—he could ignore it completely.

He had the Mountain and River Bell, a Primordial Era treasure, in his body. All Primordial Power that entered him was neutralized by the bell. Realizing this, Yang Kai felt reassured.

He'd already noticed this when he drank the Barbaric Wild Wine before. He'd had some guesses, but only now was it confirmed.

It seemed that with the Mountain and River Bell, he had a huge advantage in the Wild Ancient Land. Yang Kai was delighted. Luckily, he'd obtained this opportunity in the Shattered Star Sea—otherwise, he wouldn't have this convenience.

As he walked, he took out a jade slip and compared the scenery outside to the terrain recorded within. This was a jade slip given to him by Pi San, containing all known maps of the Wild Ancient Land and the locations of Demonic Beasts. But even this jade slip was incomplete—the full size of the Ancient Land was unknown, and the areas explored by generations of cultivators probably amounted to less than a tenth of the whole.

Still, with this jade slip, Yang Kai could avoid a lot of trouble.

An hour later, he'd fully entered the Ancient Land and found a cave to settle in.

He didn't know what kind of Demonic Beast had occupied this cave. It was dry and spacious inside, but there was no sign of the beast—maybe it was out hunting, or maybe someone had killed it.

Yang Kai figured the latter was more likely, since the cave was close to the entrance. The entering cultivators would easily find it, and Demonic Beasts generally couldn't survive in such places.

With a wave, he released Zhang Ruoxi and instructed, "I'm going to heal. Guard me, and be sure to resist the Primordial Power. If anything happens or you can't hold on, call me."

"Yes!" Zhang Ruoxi replied obediently. Seeing the shocking wound on Yang Kai's chest, her heart trembled.

She didn't ask any questions, just sat cross-legged at the cave entrance.

Inside the cave, Yang Kai took out some Healing Pills, stuffed them into his mouth, and closed his eyes to refine them.

His injuries weren't actually serious—even without treatment, he'd recover in a few days. But in a place like this, Yang Kai couldn't afford to be careless. If the scent of blood from his wounds attracted trouble, it would be a huge loss.

So he decided to heal first; searching for Xiaoxiao could wait.

At the wound, flesh squirmed and knit together—it looked frightening. Yang Kai's body was already strong, and with Healing Pills, he'd probably recover completely in a day or two.

Outside the cave, Zhang Ruoxi faithfully followed Yang Kai's instructions, using Origin Qi to protect herself.

At first, she was worried about the so-called Primordial Power. Yang Kai had mentioned its strangeness before, and she knew all cultivators entering the Ancient Land would be suppressed by it—the lower the cultivation, the worse the suppression.

She was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but on this journey, she hadn't been able to help Yang Kai at all. On the last stretch of the Ancient Land's passage, he'd even put her into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Zhang Ruoxi secretly hated her own weakness. Not only could she not help Yang Kai, she was a burden. The wound on his chest was so big—who knew how much blood he'd lost, how much it hurt, or how dangerous it had been...

Everything she had now was thanks to her master. Without him, she'd have been snatched by the Lu family's wolves and ruined, and the Zhang Family wouldn't have survived in Fenglin City.

He hadn't just saved her—he'd saved the whole Zhang Family, and given her countless cultivation resources, allowing her to achieve what she had today.

She didn't know why her master had taken her from the Zhang Family all those years ago, but after so many years, she'd grown used to following him everywhere.

But when would she be able to shield him from disaster? She couldn't always rely on his protection. Even if it was just caring for his daily needs, making his bed—she'd be happy to do it...

Yet she'd barely even done that.

Zhang Ruoxi bit her lip, her heart aching. Her longing to grow stronger made her unconsciously start meditating and cultivating.

It was an unconscious action.

But soon, Zhang Ruoxi was startled and quickly stopped.

Why? She suddenly remembered—this was the Wild Ancient Land, and the Spiritual Qi here was filled with Primordial Power. It wasn't a place to cultivate. If she absorbed Primordial Power, not only would it be useless, it would hinder her progress.

Realizing this, Zhang Ruoxi's face turned pale, and she hurriedly checked her condition.

What she found left her baffled.

She'd accidentally absorbed some Primordial Power, but it didn't seem to harm her. Instead, it spread through her body, becoming a source of strength.

Her cultivation efficiency was more than double what it used to be!

What was going on?

Zhang Ruoxi was astonished and couldn't figure it out. She wanted to ask Yang Kai—he knew more than she did—but he was busy healing, so she didn't want to disturb him.
