## Chapter 2293 — Tianhe City

Just as Yang Kai was feeling frustrated, a soft moan suddenly came from behind him. He turned his head and saw Ye Qinghan sitting askew on the wooden boat, her brows furrowed and her face full of confusion.

She still seemed unable to make sense of the situation before her eyes.

But soon, she recalled what had happened before she lost consciousness. She abruptly stood up and called out sweetly, "Young Master Yang!"

"You’re awake!" Yang Kai glanced at her and said calmly, "Don’t move around yet. Check if there’s anything wrong with your body first."

Ye Qinghan nodded at his words, closed her eyes to examine her condition, and after a moment opened them and said, "There’s nothing wrong."

She had only been knocked out by Hua Qingsi. Although she had been caught in the shockwave of the self-destruction earlier, she hadn’t suffered any serious injuries—just some instability in her Qi and blood. Taking some pills would be enough to recover.

"Yang Kai, where are that elder sister from before and the big stone man?" Ye Qinghan looked around but didn’t see Hua Qingsi or the Incarnation anywhere, so she asked suspiciously.

Yang Kai said, "What elder sister and stone man?"

"That is..." Ye Qinghan was about to describe them, but suddenly her brows knit tightly and her expression turned strange. "Could it be... that it was really an illusion?"

Thinking back to the scene of Hua Qingsi and the Incarnation appearing, she felt it was all so unreal. She began to suspect she had fallen under an illusion, and that the young woman and the stone man weren’t real at all.

"Earlier, I used an eye technique to deal with the Four Ghosts. You probably experienced a hallucination," Yang Kai replied.

"So that’s how it is!" Ye Qinghan let out a breath and gave a self-deprecating smile. "Young Master Yang, you truly have boundless abilities, while I couldn’t help at all. I’m so ashamed!"

"It’s nothing. The Four Ghosts of the Blood Saber aren’t easy opponents. If you had forced your way in, you’d probably be dead by now."

Ye Qinghan broke out in a cold sweat at his words, once again realizing the vast gap between herself and Yang Kai.

The Four Ghosts of the Blood Saber were all Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts. When the four of them joined forces and unleashed their combined secret technique, even an Emperor Realm master would have to fight with all their might. Yet in Yang Kai’s hands, they were nearly wiped out to the last.

Such a record was enough to be proud of.

Though she was also at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, Ye Qinghan found the difference in strength between herself and Yang Kai to be as great as that between clouds and mud. For a moment, she couldn’t help but feel downhearted, longing for the day she might possess power like Yang Kai’s.

She gave a bitter smile, reached to touch the back of her neck, and froze in place when she felt a slight soreness.

Recalling the scene of the young woman knocking her out, Ye Qinghan felt utterly lost, not knowing whether what she had seen before was real or just an illusion.

The journey continued in silence.

Ye Qinghan seemed to notice that Yang Kai had been in a bad mood since encountering the Four Ghosts, so she didn’t bother him. She simply guided the way and meditated on the boat when she had free time.

After more than ten days, the two finally saw a range of mountains in the distance.

Only then did Ye Qinghan rise from the boat, her face full of joy as she pointed ahead. "Young Master Yang, that’s the Chiyue Mountains. Our Thousand Leaves Sect is located within those mountains. We’ll arrive in less than half a day."

"Mm," Yang Kai replied casually.

Ye Qinghan smiled and said, "Let me send a message to my father, so he won’t worry."

She had spent several months away from home alone, which would naturally make her family anxious. Now that she was returning safely, her first thought was to let them know she was safe.

Yang Kai paid her no mind, simply sitting at the front of the boat and quietly observing the surroundings.

Ye Qinghan took out a Transmission Compass and poured her thoughts into it. Not long after, the compass suddenly buzzed, as if it had received a reply.

After checking it, Ye Qinghan’s brows suddenly furrowed and her face turned unhappy.

Yang Kai noticed her odd expression and asked, "What’s wrong?"

Ye Qinghan pouted, "My father actually wants me to represent the Thousand Leaves Sect at the City Lord of Tianhe City’s concubine-taking ceremony! I’m so angry. If I’d known, I wouldn’t have told him I was back and could’ve avoided this trouble."

"You don’t seem very willing to go," Yang Kai said with a smile, looking at her.

Ye Qinghan snorted, "I have no interest in meddling in the affairs of such an ungrateful person. Let him take his concubine if he wants. My father too—why give him this face and even send people to attend this troublesome ceremony?"

Yang Kai’s expression shifted. "Does your Thousand Leaves Sect have a grudge with this Tianhe City's City Lord?"

Ye Qinghan’s face turned cold. "That fellow is nothing but an ingrate. Back then, he only became City Lord thanks to our Thousand Leaves Sect’s support. Now that he’s grown wings and found a new backer, he doesn’t care about us anymore. He’s even squeezing our Thousand Leaves Sect out of many businesses in Tianhe City. He’s a petty villain!"

Yang Kai wasn’t very interested in these matters, so after asking casually, he didn’t say anything more.

Ye Qinghan seemed to realize she’d said too much and stuck out her tongue. "Sorry, Young Master Yang, I misspoke."

"It’s nothing. There are always some petty people in this world who make others angry," Yang Kai waved his hand.

"Young Master Yang, please wait a moment. I’ll tell my father and then take you back to the sect to settle in," Ye Qinghan said, preparing to pour her Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass again.

"No need," Yang Kai grinned. "I’ll go with you. It’ll save trouble and help me clear my mind."

Ye Qinghan was delighted at his words. "Thank you, Young Master Yang. If there’s any neglect, please forgive me."

"It’s nothing."

As they spoke, the two immediately changed direction and headed toward Tianhe City.

Tianhe City was three thousand li from the foot of the Chiyue Mountains. Though not very large, it was much better than Fenglin City and could be considered a medium-sized city.

According to Ye Qinghan, the City Lord’s mansion in Tianhe City had about a dozen Dao Origin Realm experts, and the City Lord, Luo Jin, possessed the powerful cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, on par with the sect masters of nearby mid-tier sects. That was how he maintained his position as City Lord of Tianhe City.

When Yang Kai and Ye Qinghan arrived at the city gate, they saw a bustling crowd. Carriages loaded with goods waited to enter the city, and those carriages were filled with rare treasures. Yang Kai even caught the scent of Pills and Spiritual Herbs.

Judging by the festive decorations on the carriages, it was clear the goods were congratulatory gifts prepared by the surrounding powers.

In this region of a hundred thousand li, Tianhe City was considered a significant force. Now that the City Lord was taking a concubine, all the local powers naturally came to offer their congratulations.

The guards at the city gate were full of spirit and joy, smiling as they checked the goods and let people through quickly.

Yang Kai and Ye Qinghan didn’t rush into the city but waited quietly a hundred zhang outside the gate.

According to Ye Qinghan, disciples from the Thousand Leaves Sect would be arriving soon.

Ye Qinghan had only gotten this congratulatory errand by chance. If she hadn’t returned today, she wouldn’t have been assigned to this annoying task by Ye Hen.

After all, she was the Young Sect Master of the Thousand Leaves Sect. With her leading the group, it was respectable enough.

After waiting a while, Ye Qinghan’s beautiful eyes suddenly lit up. She pointed in a direction and said, "They’re here!"

Yang Kai looked up and saw a streak of light flying rapidly from the horizon. As it drew near, it revealed itself as a tower-ship-shaped Secret Treasure. Several neatly dressed martial artists stood on the ship. One leaned on the railing, looking around, and when he saw Ye Qinghan, he grinned and waved warmly.

Ye Qinghan responded, and after a moment, the tower ship landed. The man who had greeted Ye Qinghan jumped down, and after the others disembarked, he formed a seal with his hands and put the tower ship away.

“Ye'er, you’ve finally come back. If you’d stayed away any longer, I would have gone to Fenglin City to find you myself.” The man strode straight up to Ye Qinghan, gazing at her with deep affection in his eyes, his gaze bright and unwavering—completely ignoring Yang Kai’s presence.

"Senior Brother Du Xian!" Ye Qinghan blushed under his passionate gaze, lowering her head in embarrassment.

Yang Kai saw this and immediately knew there was something between the two. He couldn’t help but smile.

Another man suddenly poked his head out from behind Du Xian and grinned. "Senior Sister Ye, you don’t know—ever since you went to Fenglin City, our Senior Brother hasn’t been able to eat or sleep, and he’s even neglected his cultivation. Master has scolded him several times!"

"You talk too much!" Du Xian glared at the man, but there was a smile in his eyes.

Ye Qinghan pressed her red lips together and said softly, "How could you do that... You still have to cultivate..."

Du Xian gazed at Ye Qinghan with deep affection and said gently, "I did cultivate, but... I couldn’t calm my mind. There’s always someone on my mind."

"Who... are you thinking of?" Ye Qinghan’s body trembled, and the blush on her cheeks deepened, as if she were on fire.

"Thinking of you, of course!" The mischievous man chimed in again. "Senior Sister Ye, your Junior Brother missed you so much it broke my heart. I couldn’t sleep at night..."

As he spoke, he put on a look of utter misery, tossing and turning, which made the other Thousand Leaves Sect disciples laugh.

"Wuma, get out of here!" Du Xian suddenly reached out and knocked the disciple called Wuma on the head, making him shrink his neck and protest, "So the official can set fires, but the commoners can’t light lamps? Is there no justice? Senior Sister Ye, you have to stand up for me!"

Ye Qinghan spat, "Serves you right for being so noisy! Senior Brother should give you a good beating."

Wuma immediately looked dejected.

Yang Kai stood quietly to the side, watching the lively scene unfold. He found the Thousand Leaves Sect disciples rather amusing—their camaraderie was genuine, and their bonds seemed close-knit. He couldn’t help but chuckle softly. It made him reflect that, in truth, the smaller the sect, the stronger the unity among its disciples when faced with adversity. Yet, once a sect grew in size and influence, all manner of intrigue and scheming would inevitably begin to fester within.

Only then did Du Xian seem to notice Yang Kai. A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes, and he cupped his fists solemnly. "I am Du Xian of the Thousand Leaves Sect. May I ask this brother’s esteemed name?"
