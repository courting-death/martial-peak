## Chapter 2101 — Emperor Returns

"Sto—Stone Giant?" Hua Qingsi stammered for a long moment before forcing the words out.

What she saw was beyond belief: a hulking form more than ten stories tall, with sharply angled contours, and on its simple, almost silly face there gleamed a pair of eyes that did not fit—bright and sparking with intelligence.

A single lift of a hand, a single step, and it seemed as if heaven and earth could tremble.

It was like an ancient mountain demon risen from myth, and it struck Hua Qingsi with an unimaginable shock.

"Stone Giant, is it? Heh, calling it that isn't wrong at all," the Incarnation sneered softly; though he had deliberately lowered his voice, it still rolled like thunder.

"You're alive? You have your own thoughts?" Hua Qingsi was no ordinary person—born of the Star God Palace, she had naturally come into contact with many secrets unknown to outsiders—so after a brief daze and shock, she quickly regained her senses and cried in surprise, though try as she might she couldn't recall any being in the world similar to what stood before her.

"Did you think you were dead?" the Incarnation mocked as he looked at Hua Qingsi.

Hua Qingsi's cheeks flushed, and then she brightened with joy, retorting, "So you're saying I'm still alive? Right—just now you said he sent me to this place; where is this?"

The Incarnation fell silent for a moment, squinting as he asked, "Are you sure you want to know?"

Hua Qingsi furrowed her brows, an inexplicable unease rising in her heart as if knowing what this place was would work greatly against her, yet curiosity got the better of her and she showed a yearning look.

“Very well. Since he chose not to kill you but sent you here instead, you can forget about ever leaving this place. Telling you changes nothing now.”

Hearing the Incarnation put it that way, Hua Qingsi's pretty face darkened and she immediately realized her fears had come true.

"This is a Small Xuan Realm—the inner space of the Imperial Treasure known as the Xuan Realm Pearl!"

"Imperial Treasure? Xuan Realm Pearl?" Hua Qingsi shrieked; her expression shifted wildly as she exclaimed, "You mean this place is its own realm? Is it on the same level as my Star God Palace's Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda?"

"More or less," the Incarnation nodded, seeming a little tired of standing and plopping down to sit. He drew his knees up and, looking toward Hua Qingsi, said, "But if you compare them, the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda and the Xuan Realm Pearl each have their advantages. Your Star God Palace's Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda allows disciples to enter and temper themselves and holds many mysteries. The Xuan Realm Pearl is different. Its main body is very small, refined by a great master. It can be carried on the person. Does that make sense?"

Hua Qingsi nodded stiffly.

She was from the Star God Palace—how could she not grasp the implication behind the Incarnation's words?

For the Star God Palace, the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda was their greatest treasure and the foundation of the sect, for countless disciples could enter it to temper, advance, grasp the laws of heaven and earth, and absorb fragments of Law Power.

It was, across the Star Realm, among the top Imperial Treasures.

The Xuan Realm Pearl, clearly, was an existence that could rival the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda; although it could not be entered for tempering, it was far more convenient to use than the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda.

It was priceless!

And its carrier was a martial artist at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!

Even an ordinary Emperor Realm expert would find acquiring an Imperial Treasure extremely difficult; Imperial Treasures were not forged at will—each one’s birth required countless years of accumulation and the lifeblood of great experts poured into them.

The value of an Imperial Treasure far exceeded that of a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.

Yet now, a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artist carried one—a treasure on par with the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda.

If word of this got out, the experts of the entire Star Realm would erupt; they would hunt Yang Kai down to seize the treasure.

"Can I pretend I didn't hear this secret…" Hua Qingsi's mouth twitched.

Having been thrown into the Xuan Realm Pearl by Yang Kai and learning this secret, nobody would let her leave again—put differently, she would be imprisoned here for life by Yang Kai!

This left Hua Qingsi simultaneously relieved she hadn't died and deeply annoyed.

"Heh heh heh…" the Incarnation laughed loudly. "From the moment you were sent in, your fate was sealed."

At this the Incarnation's voice suddenly grew somber. "He didn't kill you, clearly out of gratitude for your former lifesaving deed, but his own condition is not good; perhaps he cannot fully control his killing—so he was forced into this measure."

"Is that so?"

"Actually, you are not without a chance to leave this place."

"What?" Hua Qingsi brightened and asked anxiously.

"Die… or pledge fealty to his true body, offering your Soul Brand!"

Hua Qingsi's pretty face changed. "Impossible!"

"Everything is possible. Miss, why speak so absolutely? Do you truly want to spend the rest of your days here?" the Incarnation demanded.

Hua Qingsi fell into silence, her face torn by inner struggle. After a moment she spoke again, "That brat can barely keep himself alive right now — let's wait until he weathers this tribulation before doing anything."

The Incarnation nodded. "Indeed; this matter you must discuss with him yourself. I'm only offering advice."

Hua Qingsi's expression shifted. "By the way, why are you here?" As she spoke she seemed to have a thought and brightened. "Were you thrown into this Small Xuan Realm as well? Did he force you to offer your Soul Brand?"

She looked as if she had suddenly found a fellow sufferer in distress, eyes full of joy.

The Incarnation's face showed a strange expression, and he sighed, "I have been imprisoned by him for ten million years…"

"That scum!" Hua Qingsi ground her teeth, then immediately felt something amiss and looked at the Incarnation suspiciously. "How old is he? How do you count ten million years?"

The Incarnation extended a huge, thick finger and scratched his stony cheek with a buzzing sound. "Don't bother with such details. He's in trouble now—look at this. Do you recognize these people?"

As he spoke, the Incarnation suddenly waved his hand.

In the sky between him and Hua Qingsi a visible ripple appeared like a lake surface, and then an eerie scene manifested before them in the air.

Hua Qingsi focused and immediately said in astonishment, "This is…"

She found that the scene in the sky was exactly the place where Yang Kai stood; at that moment Yang Kai was still wrapped in thick black gas, only his eyes radiating an evil light.

Not far from Yang Kai were three people, arrayed in a triangular formation, completely surrounding him.

Each of the three exuded a profound, abyssal aura and carried an extraordinary bearing.

On the left stood a middle-aged man in simple hemp robes—plain but neat—his eyes crackling like thunder, gleaming with sharp spirit.

On the right stood a short, middle-aged elder with white hair and beard but a ruddy complexion; he frowned at Yang Kai with a hint of apprehension on his face.

In the center stood a dignified beauty with a cold temperament; her pretty face was frosty, clad in a moon-white gown that enhanced her mature charm.

After Hua Qingsi had been thrown into the Xuan Realm Pearl by Yang Kai, at some unknown time these three had mysteriously appeared and surrounded him.

Each of the three was an Emperor Realm expert of great renown in the Southern Territory, and each was someone Yang Kai had seen before.

"They're the great figures from those factions!" Hua Qingsi recognized them at a glance.

"Tell me who they are," the Incarnation said beside her.

"On the left is Chen Wenhao of the Tianwu Sacred Land; on the right is Elder Feng Ming of Wuhua Hall; and the last is Gao Xueting of the Qingyang Shrine."

"So it's them!" the Incarnation understood.

A little over a year ago these three had come to Fenglin City to investigate traces of Luanfeng on Yuqing Mountain, and later, together with Xiao Yuyang of the Star God Palace, they cast a spell to open the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda at range, allowing Fenglin City cultivators to enter and temper themselves.

Yang Kai had naturally seen their bearing at that time.

If Yang Kai knew them, then the Incarnation had heard of them as well.

Hearing Hua Qingsi name them, the Incarnation could not hide his worry.

Yang Kai's current condition seemed fierce and unstoppable, his power shocking, but these three opposite him were all Emperor Realm experts and of notable background; his true body might not be their match.

Moreover, the longer Yang Kai remained in this state the worse it became.

If these three managed to hold him down, it might truly lead to the demonic thought corroding his mind and turning him into a demonic man.

"We're saved!" Hua Qingsi cried, utterly oblivious to the Incarnation's concern. Elated, she even bawled toward him, "Big Stone, once these three gentlemen have pinned that little brat down, we can leave."

The Incarnation nodded repeatedly, his face betraying no emotion.

Outside, Chen Wenhao and the others stood motionless.

They had come because someone earlier left Fenglin City's teleportation array to rush off and raise the alarm.

The three great powers had heard the seal of an Ancient Great Demon was damaged and pure Demonic Qi was leaking, causing devastation around Fenglin City, so they did not slacken and directly dispatched Emperor Realm experts to investigate.

Chen Wenhao and the other two, having been to Fenglin City before, naturally became the first choices and shouldered the task without complaint.

The three had hurried from their sects, making use of countless Space Arrays to reach Fenglin City in the shortest time.

But when they arrived at Fenglin City they happened to encounter the Demonic Qi receding and the demonic creatures regaining their senses.

Puzzled, the three followed the trail and found the source, and here they blocked Yang Kai.

At this moment the three were all deeply puzzled.

First, signs of a Luanfeng appeared in this tiny Fenglin City; a year later, the seal of an Ancient Great Demon surfaced. Events of such magnitude all revolving around this place… the three of them could not help but feel it was utterly absurd.

They could not make out Yang Kai’s face, nor tell who exactly he had transformed into. Yet the pure Demonic Qi winding around him bore down on the three of them with an immense, suffocating pressure.

It was as if that Demonic Qi posed a fatal threat even to those at the Emperor Realm.
