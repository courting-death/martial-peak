## Chapter 2073 — Barrelling Through

"There’s even such a thing?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"That mine — either it sealed the Demonic Qi of an Ancient Great Demon, or it sealed the body of an Ancient Great Demon… Damn it, how could the Jiang Family have found this place, and actually broken the seal!" Mo Xiaoqi said, her pretty face filled with anger.

"So the reason there was so much Qingxin Jade in that pit wasn't because they formed naturally, but because of the seal?" Yang Kai murmured, pondering.

The Qingxin Jade’s greatest effect was to clear the heart and purify the spirit, directly countering Demonic Qi. Perhaps long, long ago some powerful cultivator used a vast quantity of Qingxin Jade to form an underground seal. As the Jiang Family kept excavating over the years, the seal was damaged and the Demonic Qi leaked out.

"I hope it’s the former; if it’s the latter…" Mo Xiaoqi trailed off.

"And then what?" Yang Kai asked.

Mo Xiaoqi glanced at him faintly and continued, "That would mean the Ancient Great Demon has a chance to revive, and if that happens, I’m afraid only the Ten Emperors could personally put it down."

At those words Yang Kai’s face suddenly darkened.

"The Demonic Qi is dispersing!" Mo Xiaoqi cried out; at that moment she seemed to have discovered something new.

Yang Kai stole a glance back in the briefest moment and found that, just as Mo Xiaoqi had said, the vast Demonic Qi that had shrouded an area a thousand li across seemed to be drawn and dispersed, scattering in all directions; that surging Demonic Qi was like an irresistible torrent, and wherever it surged it left devastation behind.

At the foot of the wild mountain near the mine pit there had once been a village, but as the Demonic Qi rolled through, the village immediately erupted with successive screams of agony.

Once the Demonic Qi cleared, one by one figures wrapped in black aura rose from all corners of the village…

Immediately they all fixed their gaze on the fleeing Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi in the distance and surged after them.

Those ordinary people who had never cultivated before now displayed vigor no less than fierce beasts; their bodies were lithe like leopards. Although they could never catch up to Yang Kai, they showed no sign of giving up.

"Sir…" At that moment a faint voice from within Yang Kai’s arms called out — it was Zhang Ruoxi.

"You’re awake?" Yang Kai looked down and saw Zhang Ruoxi opening her eyes and looking at him; the pallor of her pretty face had, after this period of rest, recovered a little color. Yang Kai hurriedly circulated Origin Qi, letting it flow through her body; after a circuit confirmed she had no major injuries, he breathed easier.

"Sir, please save the Zhang Family’s orphans and widows," Zhang Ruoxi pleaded. "They know nothing of what’s happened here; if we leave them be…"

Yang Kai frowned at her words, but he soon nodded, "All right, I’ll head to the Zhang Family now!"

"Thank you, Sir!" Zhang Ruoxi replied gratefully.

"Eldest Brother Yang, why don’t we split up?" Mo Xiaoqi suddenly said. "You go to the Zhang Family; I’ll head to Fenglin City to inform the City Lord to prepare defenses. If this Demonic Qi reaches Fenglin City, there may be no time left."

"Very well." Yang Kai nodded; he had planned the same, and since Mo Xiaoqi had volunteered it made things easier. "Be careful. I’ll hurry to Fenglin City and rendezvous with you, then we’ll get away from this trouble."

"Mm." Mo Xiaoqi nodded heavily, then thrust forth her power and transformed into a streak of light, launching herself toward Fenglin City.

After she left, Yang Kai suddenly accelerated.

Half a stick of incense later Yang Kai had already arrived at the Zhang Family’s estate.

At that time dawn had just broken, but the Zhang Family’s group of orphans and widows had risen very early; there were already signs of activity within the estate.

When Yang Kai arrived, the Zhang Family’s only two remaining men — a fat cultivator and a thin cultivator — were practicing their techniques on an open ground; the two were nearly equal in skill and fought fiercely.

Just as their contest reached a stalemate, a flash blurred the scene and, in an instant, another person suddenly appeared before them.

The two cultivators were startled and both stepped back, shouting, "Who goes there?"

But in the next instant the fat cultivator’s face brightened with joy, exclaiming, "Eh, it’s our benefactor!"

"And Ruoxi?" The thin cultivator saw Zhang Ruoxi gently set down by Yang Kai and greeted her warmly.

Ever since Yang Kai had last saved the Zhang Family from extinction, every member of the Zhang Family had been grateful to him; seeing him now, they all wore looks of joy.

"Second Brother… Third Brother…" Zhang Ruoxi’s pretty face flushed slightly and she sounded a little embarrassed as she called softly.

"You two talk, I’ll go find the matriarch!" Yang Kai said, and in an instant his figure blurred and he vanished.

"Our benefactor is in such a hurry, what’s the matter?" The fat cultivator sensed something amiss and anxiously looked at Zhang Ruoxi. "Has something happened?"

"It’s like this." Zhang Ruoxi knew this was no time for reminiscing and quickly told them everything about the mine pit.

After hearing it, both the fat and thin cultivators turned ashen.

At that moment the Zhang Family’s matron transmitted a message into their ears; their expressions grew grave, they urged Zhang Ruoxi on and hurried into the estate.

Half a teacup later, a fine tower-ship suddenly rose from the Zhang Family estate, quickly becoming a streak of light and shooting toward Fenglin City.

The Zhang Family now had few people left, only about a dozen; aside from the fat and thin cultivators who were men, the rest were all women, and their cultivation levels varied. To save time Yang Kai had to use the Secret Treasure tower-ship to take them all to Fenglin City.

Fortunately there were so few of them that their evacuation could be so swift; the Zhang Family matriarch did not doubt Yang Kai’s words and, upon learning the severity of the situation, decisively left with him without clinging to the family’s centuries-old estate.

The matriarch, half her life already spent, naturally knew that as long as people remained, a family could have a chance to rise again; but if everyone was gone, the family was truly finished.

The safety of a family’s members outweighed a few centuries’ worth of legacy.

The three hundred li distance was crossed in but a moment.

At the city gate, the cultivators guarding the city saw the tower-ship charging in and their faces changed; one cultivator of the First Stage of the Void King Realm drew air and shouted, "Who comes? No flying Secret Treasure may be used within Fenglin City; disembark at once!"

There was no response from the tower-ship.

As the ship drew nearer the guards’ expressions hardened, and just as they prepared to attack the ship to defend Fenglin City’s prestige, a pressure radiated from the tower-ship that they could not withstand.

"Dao Origin Realm!" The First Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator bowed his body and nearly fell to his knees; as for the others, whose cultivations were lower, their situation was naturally worse.

In that moment of distraction the tower-ship dashed rapidly into Fenglin City.

"Who is so bold as to openly use a flying Secret Treasure inside the city?"

"Has he gone mad?"

"Where is the City Lord? Why don’t they teach him a lesson?"

"Are you joking? The person in that tower-ship is a Dao Origin Realm expert. Unless the two Deputy City Lords and the city lord himself intervene, who could stop him?"

For a time all the cultivators in Fenglin City looked up to the sky and whispered among themselves.

Under ordinary circumstances Yang Kai would never have been so conspicuous, but time was tight now and he was carrying the Zhang Family’s orphans and widows, so he had no choice.

Bad news traveled far; soon word that someone had brazenly ignored Fenglin City’s rules and driven a tower-ship Secret Treasure into the city reached the ears of the major families, much to their surprise.

By now Yang Kai had already piloted the ship to the Spiritual Pill shop.

He had come here to notify Kang Siran.

In all of Fenglin City he was only somewhat close to Kang Siran and Mo Xiaoqi; with the city facing disaster it was only natural to inform them.

"Stay here and do not move; I have activated the ship’s defensive formation. I’ll be right back," Yang Kai told the Zhang Family and hurried off the ship.

At the same time Kang Siran was just stepping out of the Spiritual Pill shop, having heard the commotion.

At the sight of Yang Kai, Kang Siran’s eyes nearly popped out and he pointed at him, exclaiming, "Brother… Brother Yang, you…"

He half thought he was seeing a ghost.

After all, when Primordial Cauldron Mountain had collapsed, Yang Kai had vanished without a trace. Later Kang Siran had inquired about Yang Kai’s whereabouts and learned that the people of Blazing Fire Hall had searched the collapsed Primordial Cauldron Mountain for two months without discovering him.

Half a year passed with not a word of Yang Kai’s whereabouts.

Kang Siran had naturally concluded Yang Kai had perished in Primordial Cauldron Mountain.

But now Yang Kai had miraculously appeared before him; how could Kang Siran not be astonished?

Yet soon Kang Siran’s expression shifted to one of relief as if a burden had been lifted; he stepped forward, grasped Yang Kai’s arm with one hand and slapped his shoulder with the other, sizing him up as he said, "Good, good, Brother Yang — fortune favors the righteous. Now this foolish brother can finally rest easy!"

Truth be told Kang Siran had been plagued with guilt these past days because he had taken Yang Kai to Primordial Cauldron Mountain; when the mountain collapsed he had escaped back safely while Yang Kai had seemingly died there.

For half a year the thought had left Kang Siran sleepless and unable to cultivate in peace; he felt he had been the cause of Yang Kai’s misfortune.

Now that the source of his anguish had returned safe and sound, he naturally felt considerably lighter.

Yang Kai felt the change in Kang Siran’s mood and, seeing no need for lengthy explanation, did not elaborate.

"Brother Yang, what are you…" Kang Siran cast his gaze at the exquisite tower-ship hovering above the Spiritual Pill shop and a trace of suspicion flashed across his face, unaware of what Yang Kai intended.
