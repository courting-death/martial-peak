## Chapter 2414 — Winter Pearl

“Of all things under heaven, love is the hardest to unravel.” Yang Kai sighed softly.

Zi Yu smiled, lips pressed together. “Senior Brother Yang, are you thinking of someone?”

Yang Kai gave an awkward laugh. “Junior Sister Yu, please continue.”

Hearing him call her Junior Sister Yu, Zi Yu’s mood brightened. She continued, “Generally, any woman targeted by a Wenqing Sect disciple is doomed never to rise again. Because of the influence of the Supreme Sentiment Art, no woman can focus on cultivation anymore; her heart is entirely devoted to the Wenqing Sect disciple, treating him as her whole world. That’s the root cause of the ever-widening gap in cultivation between the two sides.”

Yang Kai nodded in agreement. “Compared to men’s more carefree nature, women fall deeper into the web of love and cannot extricate themselves.” He paused, gazing thoughtfully at Zi Yu. “Junior Sister Yu, are you telling me this because a Wenqing Sect disciple has set his sights on you?”

Zi Yu’s expression dimmed and she sighed. “You’re right, Senior Brother Yang. The one who’s after me is Wenqing Sect’s Young Sect Master, Feng Xi!”

“Feng Xi?” Yang Kai’s brows rose as he recalled the name. Zi Yu had mentioned Feng Xi when he arrived, even asking if Yang Kai was sent by him. He’d denied it then, but now he realized Feng Xi was actually Wenqing Sect’s Young Sect Master.

“My Ice Heart Valley and Wenqing Sect are both major sects of the Northern Territory. Our disciples occasionally cross paths, and Feng Xi and I have heard of each other, but never met. A few years ago, I encountered him during a training trip. Since then, he’s relentlessly pursued me, which is extremely annoying. I’ve rejected him several times, but it’s done no good.”

Yang Kai sneered. “He’s got some nerve.”

Zi Yu said, “By rights, Feng Xi and I are well matched. I might even be reaching above my station. Ice Heart Valley is still considered one of the top sects in the Northern Territory, but everyone knows that reputation is fading; our true strength can’t compare to Wenqing Sect. Unable to get his way, Feng Xi shamelessly had Wenqing Sect pressure my sect and offered great rewards. Some of our elders… agreed to the marriage, so I’m to be wed to Feng Xi in two days.”

“Ice Heart Valley’s elders compromised?” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Zi Yu said sadly, “I can’t blame them. We’re simply not as strong. In the past half year, our sect’s businesses have been repeatedly suppressed, and many Senior Sisters have been injured or even killed while training outside. To keep the sect safe, they had no choice but to agree.”

Seeing her helpless expression, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel sympathy. After a moment, he asked, “What about your master? What position does she hold in Ice Heart Valley? Did she agree too?”

Zi Yu gave a bitter smile. “After our founder disappeared, my master took charge as acting Valley Lord. She treats me like her own child and would never agree to this. She even helped me escape last time, but now she’s stretched too thin and can’t help anymore.”

“If you escaped, how were you caught again?” Yang Kai realized the acting Valley Lord hadn’t agreed to the marriage and had even helped Zi Yu flee, so Ice Heart Valley’s elders weren’t beyond hope.

Zi Yu said sadly, “Wenqing Sect’s Vice Sect Master, Yao Zhuo, personally intervened. He’s a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert—I couldn’t resist at all!”

“Yao Zhuo!” Yang Kai silently memorized the name, guessing that after Zi Yu parted ways with them a few days ago, she must have run into Yao Zhuo and was captured, then imprisoned here in the forbidden grounds.

“By the way, Feng Xi and Yao Zhuo are both guests in Ice Heart Valley right now. Senior Brother Yang, you weren’t discovered when you came, were you?” Zi Yu suddenly asked, worried.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. “So those two men were Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi.”

On his way here, he’d indeed encountered two men, one of whom was a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert. He’d wondered why there were men in Ice Heart Valley—turns out they were Wenqing Sect’s Vice Sect Master and Young Sect Master.

It seemed Zi Yu’s previous escape had made them more cautious. With the wedding in just two days, if the bride went missing, it would be a disaster. To prevent Zi Yu from escaping again, Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi were personally overseeing things in Ice Heart Valley.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “On my way here, I sensed where they were, but they didn’t notice me. Junior Sister, you can rest easy.”

Zi Yu was astonished.

Yang Kai’s cultivation was similar to hers, yet he’d sensed Yao Zhuo without being detected. How did he do it? Remembering how Yang Kai had injured Cao Yang with a single move a few days ago, Zi Yu realized he was no ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

“Now even my master is powerless. Only the founder can save me!” Zi Yu looked anxiously at Yang Kai, pleading, “Senior Brother Yang, please tell the founder what’s happening here and ask her to rescue me.”

If Yao Zhuo really took her back to Wenqing Sect, Zi Yu would become Feng Xi’s plaything. Once the Supreme Sentiment Art was used, few women in the world could resist. Feng Xi had won the hearts of at least eighty or a hundred women, with countless concubines. Zi Yu didn’t want to be one of them.

She still had a bright future and a vast sky ahead—how could she accept becoming another man’s cultivation tool, never advancing again?

“Don’t worry, Senior Bing Yun won’t stand by and do nothing. I came here at her request—she’s in Binglun City right now.” Yang Kai smiled.

Hearing this, Zi Yu burst into tears of joy, repeating, “That’s wonderful, wonderful!”

The founder was in Binglun City—she would surely save her from this misery.

Suddenly, Zi Yu remembered something. When she met Yang Kai a few days ago, she’d also run into several women claiming to be Ice Heart Valley disciples. At the time, she thought they were sent by the elders to capture her, so she fled.

Thinking back, she realized she’d never seen those Ice Heart Valley disciples before—their faces were completely unfamiliar, and their cultivation levels varied. Clearly, they weren’t her childhood companions.

Could they be disciples taken in by the founder? Is that why they called themselves Ice Heart Valley members? If they were on the multi-deck ship, did that mean the founder was there too?

Realizing this, Zi Yu was filled with regret. She’d been so close to the founder, yet missed the chance to reunite, and was later captured by Yao Zhuo. Her cleverness had backfired, and she was full of remorse.

If only she’d stayed with the founder, none of this trouble would have happened.

“Senior Brother Yang, you should hurry back to Binglun City. If you stay here too long, you might be discovered.” Zi Yu urged, collecting herself.

“Aren’t you coming with me?” Yang Kai asked.

Zi Yu gave a bitter smile. “This is the forbidden ground of Ice Lake, and there are countless barrier formations outside. How could I possibly leave?”

Yang Kai chuckled. “How do you think I got in?”

Zi Yu was startled and looked at the token in her hand. “Could it be…?”

Yang Kai nodded. “This is a token bestowed by Senior Bing Yun. It can break all the barriers in the valley. Since I’m here, I won’t leave empty-handed. You’ll come with me to Binglun City and explain everything to Senior Bing Yun yourself.”

“Senior Brother Yang, you can take me with you?” Zi Yu was overjoyed.

“Of course.” Yang Kai nodded with a smile. “But wait a moment.”

“What is it?” Zi Yu asked, puzzled. She watched as Yang Kai walked past her, heading straight for the center of the island.

At the island’s center stood something like an altar, and above it rested a water-blue orb, radiating waves of cold.

The orb was about the size of a longan fruit and seemed to be the source of the icy chill here. The closer Yang Kai got, the more he sensed the terrifying energy within.

Seeing this, Zi Yu explained, “That’s a Secret Treasure left by the founder. We don’t know its name or where she got it. The founder released some of its energy, creating this Ice Lake forbidden ground. When we cultivate here, we can better comprehend the profound intent and laws of cold. My master said the orb’s origin might be extraordinary, but even the founder doesn’t know exactly what it does.”

As she explained, she watched Yang Kai’s actions, unsure why he was so interested in the orb.

She even saw Yang Kai trembling with excitement, as if he’d discovered something incredible.

“Senior Brother Yang, you can’t get any closer. If you do, you won’t be able to withstand it.” Zi Yu warned, but immediately realized her mistake—if Yang Kai couldn’t handle it, he wouldn’t keep going. Yet he pressed on, proving he could resist the orb’s chill.

She was secretly amazed. Even though she cultivated ice techniques, she couldn’t get close to the orb, but Yang Kai seemed even stronger than her.

Was Senior Brother Yang personally taught by the founder? Otherwise, how could he be so capable? But why would the founder accept a male disciple?

While she was lost in thought, Yang Kai had already reached a zhang from the altar. At this distance, he couldn’t go any further; his whole body was freezing, and no matter how he circulated his Origin Qi, he couldn’t resist the bone-chilling cold.

Frost even appeared on his hair and clothes.

But instead of fear, his eyes shone with excitement—he looked utterly delighted.

Suddenly, he flipped his hand, and a fiery red orb appeared in his palm.

Zi Yu stared, stunned. The orb Yang Kai produced was almost identical to the one on the altar, except for its color.

And as soon as Yang Kai took out the Fiery Red Bead, the ice orb on the altar began to tremble and hum. At the same time, the fiery red orb in Yang Kai’s hand also emitted a humming sound—the two seemed to resonate with each other.

“Winter Pearl!” Yang Kai cried out in excitement, “It’s the Winter Pearl!”
