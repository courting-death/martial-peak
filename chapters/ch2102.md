## Chapter 2102 — One Against Three

The three sped through the air, seeing that all the demons had already regained their senses, except for the one before them, who remained shrouded in Demonic Qi and radiated a boundless, violent aura.

"Who are you?" Chen Wenhao was the first to ask.

He wanted to know why this demon before him not only failed to recover his senses like the others, but was instead so unbelievably powerful.

There was no response from the other side, only the faint sound of deep roars coming from within the Demonic Qi, like a crazed wild beast.

"Brother Chen, he probably has no sense left, so what's the point of talking to him?" Feng Ming said impatiently, his sinister eyes fixed on Yang Kai's figure.

Gao Xueting did not speak; her beautiful eyes shimmered as if trying to pierce through the thick Demonic Qi to see Yang Kai's true face.

But at that moment, Yang Kai seemed to sense something and suddenly turned his head to look at her.

Their gazes met, and an invisible clash erupted.

With a soft cry, Gao Xueting's face paled slightly, her delicate body staggering in place as if struck by a heavy blow.

"Let..." From within the Demonic Qi came a low, hoarse growl, unbearably suppressed and painful. Though the words were unclear, the three still heard it and understood what the demon wanted.

A strange look flashed in Chen Wenhao's eyes. Suddenly, he stepped forward, his wrist turning as a blue-flowered longsword appeared in his hand. He said calmly, "Let me test his skills. You two, cover me!"

As his words fell, a soft sound rang out.

Chen Wenhao transformed into a swift, fleeting shadow, rushing forward like a bolt of lightning. He appeared before Yang Kai.

Ching—ching—

Sword light danced, sword intent sang, the sword's momentum was as wild as a storm, sweeping out waves of mournful cries.

Sparks shot in all directions, energy splashed through the void, the longsword was as fast as lightning, as dense as a torrential rain.

After a short while, Chen Wenhao withdrew his sword and remained in the same spot, as if he'd never moved.

On the other side, only now did cracks appear in the Demonic Qi surrounding Yang Kai's body, densely packed like a spider's web. Through those cracks, some parts of his body could be vaguely seen. The exposed skin was covered in intricate Demon Marks. But as the Demonic Qi churned, those cracks healed in the blink of an eye.

Chen Wenhao frowned.

Gao Xueting and Feng Ming were also extremely surprised.

Yang Kai was far more troublesome than they had expected.

"Die!" As if completely enraged by Chen Wenhao's attack, Yang Kai roared. It was as if a king from the Netherworld had sounded the charge. Demonic Qi surged around him, emitting ghostly wails and wolf howls.

Whoosh, whoosh—

He suddenly vanished from where he stood.

"What?" Chen Wenhao was truly shocked this time.

Even with the full strength of his Divine Sense, he could not grasp Yang Kai's movements; the speed surpassed his comprehension.

He drove his Divine Sense to the utmost, weaving a seamless net ten zhang beyond his body, hoping to catch the slightest trace of Yang Kai’s movements.

"Careful!" Gao Xueting's pretty face suddenly changed, and she cried out.

"Brother Chen, behind you!" Feng Ming also shouted.

There was no need for their warnings. The moment Yang Kai appeared behind him, Chen Wenhao sensed it. In the blink of an eye, he channeled the power of the Law and, with a burst of sword light, thrust his sword backward like a meteor.

Clang—

A crisp sound rang out. Chen Wenhao instinctively felt he had definitely struck something, but it was completely blocked. Not only that, his sword let out a mournful cry, its light flashing wildly. Startled, he broke out in a cold sweat and quickly shifted his steps, leaping forward.

A violent force erupted behind him. Though it didn't harm him, it left him shaken.

Before he could steady himself, Yang Kai followed like a shadow, appearing at his right side. His fist, wrapped in Demonic Qi, smashed down with a world-destroying force.

The move was simple, but extremely brutal, truly a return to the basics.

There was nowhere to dodge!

Deep inside, Chen Wenhao was shaken. As an Emperor Realm expert, even if he was only at the First Stage, he had already touched the threshold of the Martial Dao's true meaning. Even against a Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, he would not be completely suppressed and could still put up a fight.

Yet this mysterious demon had completely overwhelmed him with its extraordinary speed and technique, leaving him unable to fight back.

At the critical moment, he shouted, "Body as Water!"

As soon as he spoke, his whole body suddenly became semi-transparent, as if molded from water.

Yang Kai's fist punched a large hole straight through his body, his arm passing right through his chest.

Chen Wenhao couldn't help but groan, clearly suffering a serious injury.

Despite the blow, he didn't retreat. Instead, he channeled his Origin Qi, causing his water-like body to contract and trap Yang Kai's arm.

At that moment, Feng Ming and Gao Xueting, who had been watching, joined the fray.

A long spear appeared in Feng Ming's hand, its tip crackling with electricity. This was the Yan Lei Spear, an Imperial Treasure he had forged through a Blood Sacrifice. It was renowned throughout the Southern Territory.

"Unending Thunder!" Feng Ming shouted, seizing the opportunity created by Chen Wenhao, his spear dancing as a torrent of thunder crashed toward Yang Kai.

On the other side, a small mirror suddenly appeared in Gao Xueting's palm. As Origin Qi poured in, the mirror shone with dazzling light, like a small sun hanging in midair. A mysterious ray shot out, enveloping Yang Kai's body. Her expression was cold and solemn, her moon-white dress billowing as she floated in the air like a goddess descending from the heavens.

A scorching aura spread, as if to burn all things.

The Demonic Qi rolling on Yang Kai's body seemed to meet its nemesis, writhing and churning, turning into wisps of green smoke that drifted away.

"The Imperial Treasure, the Scorching Sun Mirror!"

Inside the Small Xuan Realm, through the projection manifested by the Incarnation’s methods, Hua Qingsi could see everything happening outside with perfect clarity.

Her face was full of excitement, and she shouted loudly.

She knew all three of them, and was familiar with the Secret Treasures they used. Even if she had never seen them before, she could recognize them at a glance.

The longsword in Chen Wenhao's hand was no ordinary Secret Treasure, but the Imperial Treasure, the Waterflow Sword.

Three great Imperial Treasures, three Emperor Realm experts attacking together—she could already envision the demon king-like Yang Kai's defeat.

This made her smell the scent of freedom...

Amidst flashes of lightning and thunder, the Scorching Sun Mirror's light enveloped everything. Yang Kai seemed to sense a fatal threat. Suddenly, he let out a wild roar, and a majestic, Yang aura erupted, completely different from the previous evil and violent one.

In the next moment, the arm trapped in Chen Wenhao's water-transformed body suddenly swelled. Dragon scales appeared piece by piece, and the entire hand transformed into a dragon claw.

With this boost, he yanked hard.

Chen Wenhao groaned, his water-transformed body seeming unable to hold together, and Yang Kai broke free, bringing a spray of blood.

Immediately, Yang Kai turned and grabbed at the torrent of lightning rushing toward him.

Crackle—

Yang Kai's body trembled violently as he used the dragon claw's power to withstand Feng Ming's technique, but the numbing current was impossible to shake off.

Taking advantage of this, Gao Xueting's beautiful eyes grew cold as she increased the power of the Scorching Sun Mirror.

The Demonic Qi on Yang Kai's body evaporated even faster, making him cry out in pain, as if suffering extreme torment.

"Die, all of you must die!" A roar rang out, and the space within a dozen li suddenly shifted.

The power of Law descended, causing Gao Xueting to pause.

On the other side, Chen Wenhao, having been freed from Yang Kai, tried to attack with his sword, but his body suddenly grew heavy.

"Spatial Law?" Gao Xueting screamed, her beautiful eyes trembling violently.

The three Emperor Realm experts present had all reached this level by comprehending Law Power through their own secret techniques or cultivation methods.

Each Emperor Realm expert's understanding of Law Power was different, and their specialized Domains varied.

Only those exceptionally gifted geniuses could comprehend the deepest, most primal Laws within their chosen Domain.

The Five Elements Law, the true meaning of various powers, the mysteries of various divine abilities—all were the foundation for Emperor Realm experts to grow stronger.

Among these, the most mysterious and elusive Law Powers were the hardest to comprehend.

Without a doubt, Spatial Law was one of them, almost impossible to grasp.

In countless years of the Star Realm, many Great Emperors had reached the peak through their understanding of Law Power, but none had ever done so through Spatial Law.

Spatial Law was too profound—even Emperor Realm experts could only look on in awe.

Yet here and now, a demonized creature was using Space Law to seal the heavens and earth!

Gao Xueting's breath caught.

In her moment of distraction, Yang Kai charged straight at her, braving the might of the Scorching Sun Mirror.

Like thunder, like lightning, his speed was beyond imagination.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai was in front of Gao Xueting. He completely ignored this enemy who wanted to kill him, and punched at the Scorching Sun Mirror.

Roar—

The roar of a dragon rang out, and a dozen pitch-black demon dragons shot from his fist, flying through the sky.

Gao Xueting reacted quickly and dodged in time, but still could not completely avoid them.

Boom, boom, boom—

The pitch-black demon dragons collided with the Scorching Sun Mirror, its light flickering.

When Gao Xueting flew back to Feng Ming and Chen Wenhao's side, her pretty face had turned grim, her heart aching as she looked at the Imperial Treasure she had refined through Blood Sacrifice.

A faint layer of black Qi seemed to cover the Scorching Sun Mirror, damaging its spirit.

Inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, Hua Qingsi was dumbfounded, her small mouth forming a circle as she muttered, "He's this strong?"

She had thought that with three Emperor Realm experts joining forces and even bringing out their Imperial Treasures, taking down Yang Kai would be a matter of moments. But after one exchange, it was the three Emperor Realm experts who suffered setback after setback, while Yang Kai was unstoppable.

Hua Qingsi's heart could not accept it at all.
