## Chapter 2411 — Night Visit to Ice Heart Valley

Although he didn’t know why Bing Yun suddenly brought up this matter from years ago, Yang Kai felt she must have her own reasons, so he didn’t interrupt and listened quietly.

“Later, after I succeeded in my cultivation, I established the Ice Heart Valley in the Northern Territory and took in some disciples. Ice Heart Valley gradually grew stronger and achieved its current scale, but I never forgot the life-saving grace I received. Three thousand years ago, I left Ice Heart Valley, vowing that even if I had to travel the entire Star Realm, I would find him and repay his kindness from back then. At the very least, I wanted to thank him in person!” Bing Yun smiled faintly. “For those of us who cultivate, even a drop of kindness should be repaid with a gushing spring, let alone a life-saving favor.”

“Unfortunately, before I could investigate further, I accidentally fell into the Jixu Secret Realm. I was trapped there for three thousand years, and only after meeting you was I able to escape.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally realized that Bing Yun had actually been trapped in the Jixu Secret Realm for three thousand years. Understanding this, Yang Kai was shocked. In the Jixu Secret Realm, Bing Yun was unable to improve her cultivation. In other words, three thousand years ago, she was already a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. If she hadn’t been stranded in the Jixu Secret Realm, she might have reached the level of Great Emperor in these three thousand years.

“Finding that expert is my lifelong wish, so no matter where he is, I will keep searching until I find him!” Bing Yun said resolutely.

Yang Kai asked, “Then Ice Heart Valley...?”

Bing Yun smiled faintly. “Although I personally founded Ice Heart Valley, I can’t protect it forever. If my disciples have the ability to let it continue to flourish, that would be best. If they are incapable, then it can only decline. In this world, there is no sect that stands forever, no family that always prospers. It’s just like the cycle of life and death, the way of heaven.”

Yang Kai agreed, “Senior, you make a good point.”

Bing Yun continued, “Back then, when I left Ice Heart Valley, I was still somewhat uneasy, so before leaving, I left something in the sect. It’s a Secret Treasure I refined with a secret technique. I told a few disciples that if the sect ever faced a great calamity and couldn’t cope, they could use that Secret Treasure to send me a message, and I would return as soon as possible.”

As she spoke, Bing Yun gently took out a jade token from her Spatial Ring and displayed it in her palm. “Just now, I sensed the fluctuation of that Secret Treasure!”

Yang Kai looked closely and saw that the jade token was flickering with a faint light, appearing and disappearing like a firefly.

His expression changed as he said, “Is Ice Heart Valley facing a calamity of annihilation?”

Bing Yun shook her head. “I’m not sure, but the sudden appearance of so many Emperor Realm experts in Binglun City is extremely abnormal. It’s very likely related to the sect’s current crisis!”

“Then what do you want me to do, Senior?” Yang Kai looked at her and asked. Bing Yun had said so much and taken out this jade token, clearly wanting his help.

Bing Yun said, “I still need two or three days to recover and can’t leave here. I’d like you to go to Ice Heart Valley and secretly see what’s really happening there.”

Yang Kai didn’t hesitate and nodded. “No problem. Since Senior has asked, I’ll go. But your sect is one of the top sects in the Northern Territory. It’s not easy to enter. If I accidentally trigger some restriction or formation, with my current strength...”

If he really triggered a restriction or formation, Yang Kai would be treated like a rat crossing the street, with everyone after him. Even without Bing Yun, Ice Heart Valley wouldn’t lack Emperor Realm experts. At that time, he’d be outnumbered and might not be able to escape.

“You don’t need to worry about that. Take my token with you. No restriction or formation can stop you.” As she spoke, Bing Yun took out another token. This one was pure white, as if carved from the most beautiful jade in the world, flawless. On it was engraved a large ‘Yun’ character, which should be Bing Yun’s name.

Yang Kai reached out and took it.

Bing Yun handed the other glowing jade token to Yang Kai as well. “Take this too. You can use it to sense the location of the Secret Treasure I left behind. When I left back then, I placed the Secret Treasure in the forbidden area of Ice Heart Valley. It should still be there now.”

“I’ve got it.” Yang Kai nodded solemnly and put both jade tokens into his Spatial Ring.

“Take this as well!” Bing Yun suddenly handed over a round bead with great seriousness.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he exclaimed, “Emperor Extinction Pill!”

He was very familiar with this bead-like item—it was indeed an Emperor Extinction Pill. Previously, he had obtained one from the Great Emperor of Time in the Four Seasons Land, but used it in a small secret realm of Thousand Leaves Sect. With one move, the power of time filled the air, sending a Third Stage Emperor Realm Corpse Puppet flying, and Yang Kai himself used that power to break through to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

The Emperor Extinction Pill seals a full-powered strike from an Emperor Realm expert, and ordinary Emperor Realm experts can’t even refine one. Only those at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm or above, after expending great effort and time, might be able to do so.

Such things are usually given by Emperor Realm experts to juniors as life-saving tools. No Emperor Realm expert would refine too many in their lifetime—three is the limit. Making more would affect their own foundation.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected Bing Yun to be so generous, giving him an Emperor Extinction Pill for protection.

Bing Yun said, “I refined this when I first reached the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. It contains one of my secret techniques. Use it with caution!”

Yang Kai happily accepted it, carefully storing it away. He stood up and said, “There’s no time to lose. I’ll set out now.”

“Be careful in everything. If you’re really discovered, just show my token. Those girls won’t dare touch you.” Bing Yun reminded him.

Yang Kai grinned. “With your words, Senior, I’m at ease.”

After saying that, he turned and left.

There are no male disciples in Ice Heart Valley. This is a rule set by Bing Yun herself—the valley only accepts female disciples. This rule is exactly the same as the Ice Heart Valley on Chi Lan Star. When Yang Kai visited the Ice Heart Valley on Chi Lan Star, he never saw a man there. The sect was filled with women of all shapes and sizes. Any man entering Ice Heart Valley would be dazzled by the sight.

Originally, this matter shouldn’t have been for Yang Kai to investigate, but among Bing Yun’s disciples, the strongest, Fan Xin, was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Compared to Yang Kai, her strength was worlds apart. That’s why Bing Yun had no choice but to ask Yang Kai for help.

Yang Kai understood this well. Moreover, Bing Yun not only gave him the token to use, but also bestowed an Emperor Extinction Pill, showing how much she valued this matter. With this double protection, Yang Kai felt that even sneaking into Ice Heart Valley to investigate wouldn’t be too dangerous.

Binglun City wasn’t far from Ice Heart Valley. Flying directly, it would only take an hour to arrive. After all, Binglun City was a transfer hub for Ice Heart Valley’s interactions and trade with the outside world. If it were too far from the sect, it would lose its purpose.

Yang Kai didn’t say goodbye to anyone and left Binglun City alone, leisurely flying toward the direction of Ice Heart Valley.

It wasn’t until nightfall that Yang Kai reached the edge of Ice Heart Valley.

The entire Ice Heart Valley sat in a huge mountain valley, surrounded by mountains on all sides. The terrain was easy to defend and hard to attack, and the environment was beautiful with dense Spiritual Qi. It was clear that Bing Yun had put a lot of thought into choosing the site for Ice Heart Valley’s headquarters. There must be an excellent Earth Vein here; otherwise, the Spiritual Qi wouldn’t be so abundant.

To enter Ice Heart Valley, one had to pass through a passage at the valley entrance that stretched a thousand zhang. On both sides and at the end of this passage, female disciples of Ice Heart Valley stood guard. Outsiders simply couldn’t get in.

Naturally, Yang Kai couldn’t just stroll openly through the main entrance of the valley. His purpose this time was to find the disciple who had managed to contact Bing Yun and ask her what exactly was happening in Ice Heart Valley.

He circled around the outskirts of Ice Heart Valley, investigating, then headed straight in one direction.

After a while, Yang Kai stopped and swept his Divine Sense ahead.

Ahead, an invisible barrier blocked the way. It was clearly a protective and warning formation of Ice Heart Valley. If an outsider triggered it, the entire Ice Heart Valley would be alerted, and Yang Kai would have no chance to escape.

Yang Kai didn’t act rashly. Instead, he hid in the shadows and waited for about an hour. After confirming that there were no disciples nearby, he took out the token Bing Yun had given him and waved it at the barrier.

A mysterious light shot out from the token, and in the next moment, the barrier silently opened a gap.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai slipped inside. With space power swirling around him, he hid in the shadows like a ghost and used the Nothingness secret technique to conceal his presence.

Entering Ice Heart Valley so easily, Yang Kai felt much more at ease. It seemed Bing Yun’s token really could ignore all the valley’s restrictions and formations.

He took out the other jade token, sensed the location of the Secret Treasure, and quietly headed in that direction.

The deeper he went, the more martial artists he sensed. These were clearly disciples of Ice Heart Valley. As one of the top sects in the Northern Territory, Ice Heart Valley naturally had many disciples. However, those Yang Kai encountered weren’t very strong—the most powerful were only at the Dao Origin Realm. With his strength and concealment techniques, he had no fear of being discovered.

Half an hour later, after circling around a building, Yang Kai was about to go deeper when he suddenly stopped, his expression turning strange.

He actually heard men’s voices here.

The voices came from a nearby building, and it seemed there was more than one man—clearly, two men were talking.

How could there be men in Ice Heart Valley? Yang Kai was stunned. This was a sect for women; men were generally not allowed to enter.

Could it be that some Ice Heart Valley disciple couldn’t resist loneliness and secretly kept a lover here? The thought startled Yang Kai. If this were true, Ice Heart Valley’s reputation would be ruined.
