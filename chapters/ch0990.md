## Chapter 990 — Who Is the Most Pitiful

Inside the warship's power room, the young man who called himself Shen Tu stared dumbfounded, his face a portrait of dismay—he had not expected Yang Kai to actually frame him.

He opened his mouth, wanting to argue, but when he saw the Saint Crystal clenched in his hand, Shen Tu instantly realized there was no point in saying anything.

Right now, it was like yellow mud slipping into one’s crotch—whether it was shit or not, it would be taken as shit.

So he ignored the fierce glare Ke Meng shot his way and paid no heed to Yang Kai’s despicable trick; decisively shutting his eyes, he gripped the Saint Crystal with both hands, frantically circulated his technique, and began drawing the energy from the Saint Crystal.

It was like a destitute beggar insisting on having one last full meal before dying.

Now it was Yang Kai’s turn to gape in astonishment.

“Brat, you dare stir up trouble in my territory? You’ve got guts!” Ke Meng sneered, rushing up to Shen Tu and laying into him with a flurry of punches and kicks without another word.

He struck with brutal force; the thuds echoed, showing no concern at all for Shen Tu’s life or death.

But Yang Kai keenly noticed that Ke Meng’s strikes avoided Shen Tu’s vital points—instead they only inflicted intense pain without posing any fatal danger.

He did not wish to kill any cultivator who was supplying power for the warship.

Ke Meng kept beating him while spouting the vilest curses, insulting him in the highest degree.

Shen Tu said nothing and endured it; his square face contorted with pain, yet he continued to siphon power from the Saint Crystal, as if vowing not to stop until its energy was completely drained.

Yang Kai’s expression turned wry; his perception of Shen Tu shifted subtly.

Although Yang Kai detested the man’s earlier behavior, there was no denying he had an iron will and extraordinary tolerance.

After some time, Ke Meng finally stopped, scolded him one more time, then turned and left.

He did not take the Saint Crystal from Shen Tu’s hand, implicitly leaving it to him—though Shen Tu had paid a heavy price, beaten black and blue with blood seeping from his mouth.

Staring at Ke Meng’s back as he vanished into the darkness, Shen Tu wiped the corner of his mouth; a knife‑sharp chill flashed in his eyes.

He glanced at Yang Kai and let out a faint, cold sneer.

The Saint Crystal in his hand had, after his wild, unrestrained siphoning, lost much of its energy and dulled in luster.

After drawing on it a while longer, it actually crumbled into dust and slipped from his palm.

Yang Kai felt a slight stir.

Everyone knew how immense the energy within a Saint Crystal was; Shen Tu’s ability to absorb it all in such a short span proved his cultivation method was no simple thing.

Yang Kai casually tossed another Saint Crystal toward him.

This time Shen Tu didn’t take it—he only regarded Yang Kai with cold eyes, wounded and wary, and sneered, “Do you think I’m stupid enough to fall for the same trick twice?”

Yang Kai paid him no mind, merely closing his eyes to rest.

Shen Tu watched him a while, found it uninteresting, and stopped wasting effort—pretending the Saint Crystal lying at his feet did not exist.

Time flowed on slowly.

The next day, Ke Meng distributed two Saint Crystals to each of the bound cultivators; Yang Kai was no exception.

After receiving his two Saint Crystals, Shen Tu immediately began drawing from them; a day’s consumption had already left him exhausted, desperately in need of replenishment.

Before long, both portions were consumed.

He licked his lips with lingering appetite and, hesitating, eyed the Saint Crystal Yang Kai had thrown yesterday, his mind torn.

He wanted to take it but feared Yang Kai would summon Ke Meng again; after much agonized indecision he finally gave up, inwardly cursing Yang Kai as despicable and shameless.

He closed his eyes and refused to look at the temptation so close at hand.

For several days the pattern repeated.

Yet as time passed, Shen Tu felt his internal strength increasingly inadequate; the shackles continuously siphoned Saint Yuan, and without adequate replenishment he could not maintain his condition and gradually grew weak like the others.

By contrast, Yang Kai’s situation formed an extremely sharp contrast.

Apart from the dozen or so Saint Crystals Ke Meng had initially given him, he also received two shares each day, and Yang Kai had even asked Ke Meng for additional crystals.

Of the crystals he obtained, he used less than half to sustain himself; the rest he hid inside the Demon God’s Secret Codex for future use.

Ke Meng did not refuse his requests much—apparently because of the beautiful woman Bi Ya, Ke Meng treated him generously, not only giving Saint Crystals but also two or three Saint Pills to keep his strength and spirit up, in case Bi Ya returned to take him away.

This made Shen Tu’s eyes burn with envy; his look at Yang Kai changed, full of contempt as if staring at a pampered pretty boy living off others.

A few more days passed and Shen Tu’s complexion grew ever worse.

He felt that if he didn’t receive sufficient replenishment, his current realm might slip.

Sensing the crisis, Shen Tu could no longer restrain himself; one day after draining his allotted shares, he finally succumbed to the temptation of that Saint Crystal and picked it up.

He took it with caution while watching Yang Kai’s reaction, and to his surprise, when he finished drawing its energy Yang Kai didn’t so much as glance his way—no framing this time.

Just then, another Saint Crystal flew toward him.

Shen Tu’s brow tightened as he caught it, scrutinized Yang Kai, and in a low voice asked, “What do you mean by this?”

“Nothing in particular—my Saint Crystals are more than I can use,” Yang Kai shrugged.

Shen Tu’s mouth twitched; he sneered, “Even if you give them to me, I won’t be grateful—once I was done over by you, so let’s call it even.”

“If I wanted someone’s gratitude, there are plenty here I could give to and get it—no need to give it to you,” Yang Kai replied.

“What do you want?” Shen Tu asked warily.

Once bitten, twice shy—Shen Tu simply did not trust Yang Kai.

“An ally!” Yang Kai said in a low voice.

“An ally?” Shen Tu narrowed his eyes, glanced around to make sure no one was watching, then said meaningfully, “You have big ideas.”

“Don’t you?” Yang Kai countered.

Shen Tu was at a loss for words and fell silent.

“I framed you earlier because you talked too much—I don’t want to be entangled with someone who chatters. But now you’re the only one around me with any energy; I have no choice.”

“Well then I’m truly honored,” Shen Tu chuckled low. “But having ideas doesn’t mean they’ll come to fruition.”

“We’ll take it one step at a time—can’t just sit and wait to die.”

Shen Tu’s eyes shone brightly; he grinned, secret and sly, fixed his gaze on Yang Kai, then resumed a swaggering air and sniffed, “If you can give me one Saint Crystal every day from now on, our past grudge is wiped clean.”

“Fine!” Yang Kai nodded magnanimously.

Shen Tu chuckled, “I suddenly find you rather pleasing to the eye.”

Saying that, he secretly slipped the Saint Crystal he had just received into his robe to use tomorrow; at his realm he generally only needed three Saint Crystals a day to maintain his power, but Ke Meng had only given him two to prevent him having enough vitality to think of other things.

“Let me introduce myself again—Shen Tu.”

“Yang Kai.”

The two met each other’s eyes and exchanged a knowing smile.

Bi Ya had gone out on a mission; Yang Kai didn’t know when she would return, but he guessed that once she did his misfortune would follow—he had to prepare before Bi Ya came back.

Yet in the power room almost everyone was painfully weak; as Yang Kai had said, aside from Shen Tu there was barely anyone with energy—the rest were little more than walking corpses, likely without the strength even to speak.

He could not glean the information he wanted from those people.

No matter Shen Tu’s temperament or future prospects, he was currently the most suitable choice.

“How much do you know about this great ship?” Yang Kai quietly projected his mind and communicated with Shen Tu.

“How much do you know?” Shen Tu countered.

“I only know there’s a Saint King Realm expert stationed here and that it belongs to a force called Purple Star; beyond that I’m not sure.”

“Then I know more,” Shen Tu chuckled. “They even sent an Upper‑Level Saint King‑grade warship into this perilous Chaos Abyss for two women; those two seem to have something they want.”

“I’ve seen those two women,” Yang Kai interrupted.

“You’ve seen them?” Shen Tu’s eyes brightened.

“Yeah—one is Second Stage of the Saint Realm, the other Third Stage of the Saint Realm; they’re from the Sword Alliance. What could they possibly have that makes Purple Star act so drastically?”

“That I don’t know,” Shen Tu replied puzzled. “Damn it, I just ran into them outside the Chaos Abyss and was captured and pressed into labor. When I get out, one day I’ll destroy Purple Star entirely.”

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise.

“That’s my lifelong vow!” Shen Tu added.

“What about the others here?”

“They’re probably all enemies of Purple Star; after capture they’re placed in the power room to slave away until they die! Every force does this, so don’t be captured lightly or you’ll meet a tragic end. These are the relatively fortunate ones—others get sent to extremely dangerous places to mine or gather herbs… their lives hang by a thread and are even more pitiable than those here.”

He wore an expression of deep pity, as if he had endured such things himself, which left Yang Kai astonished.

After speaking for a while, he looked at Yang Kai with exaggerated sympathy: “But the most miserable of all is you—you actually attracted the attention of that woman Bi Ya, hahaha!”

He laughed at Yang Kai’s misfortune; Yang Kai was left speechless.
