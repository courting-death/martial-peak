## Chapter 2123 — Projection

The Jade Maiden Beggar Token, which remained completely unscathed no matter how much brute force Yang Kai used or what methods Qin Chaoyang tried, was casually crushed into four or five pieces in Deacon Tao’s hand!

He didn’t even need to exert the slightest effort!

Yang Kai stood there dumbfounded, staring ahead, his mind in utter chaos.

Qin Chaoyang's jaw hung as if dislocated, mouth agape and eyes wide, his thoughts in a tangle.

“Heh...” Deacon Tao let out a cold laugh, casually tossing the fragments of the token aside. “This kind of trash? I could carve out hundreds of them myself. Garbage like this as a token? What a joke! You two scum, do you have anything left to say?”

“Brother Qin...” Yang Kai called out in a low voice, turning to look at him. “What is going on?”

He hoped Qin Chaoyang could give him a reasonable explanation.

But Qin Chaoyang didn’t respond, standing there like he’d lost his soul, blankly in place.

"We’ve been played..." Yang Kai howled inwardly, cursing the so-called expert to high heaven!

The token had never failed before, but the moment it reached Deacon Tao's hand it shattered. Clearly the power bound to the token had been nullified; otherwise Deacon Tao could not have broken the Jade Maiden Beggar Token!

Now the token lay in fragments, the proof gone, and no explanation would save them.

Yang Kai already considered whether, once they escaped Qingyang Mountain Range, he should leave the Southern Territory altogether. With such a colossal force targeting him, it would only be a matter of time before something happened.

“All disciples, heed my order! Follow me and execute these two treacherous rats on the spot, to uphold the might of our Shrine!” Deacon Tao could no longer wait to give the command.

The two First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators charged forward. Junior Brother Fatty and the blue-faced Senior Brother, seizing a chance for revenge and ignoring the cultivation gap, followed closely behind.

“Brother Qin, let’s go!” Yang Kai shouted loudly.

Yet Qin Chaoyang still did not move; he stood there, lips trembling and muttering as if in shock: "Broken... it's broken..."

It seemed that what had just happened had dealt him a heavy blow.

What shattered before him was not just a token, but the only hope of saving Qin Yu’s life!

At that critical moment a mysterious force appeared.

Time seemed to freeze in that instant.

In the sky, clouds surged, winds howled, thunder and lightning flashed.

The rhythm of energy spread leisurely from the clouds above...

In that moment, Yang Kai, Qin Chaoyang, Deacon Tao, and the others all felt a terrifying pressure descend upon them.

Not just them—all cultivators throughout the Qingyang Mountain Range felt it, shuddering under the pressure...

...

"What is this..." At the main peak of the Qingyang Mountain Range, inside a palace, a middle-aged man in purple robes—around forty—sat in seclusion cultivating a secret art. When the pressure surged he opened his eyes; a sharp light flashed within and he stared in one direction as if piercing the void to see events thousands of li away. His face turned grave; after a moment he exclaimed, "How is this possible!"

At the same time, on another peak, where birds sang and flowers bloomed, the scenery was so beautiful it seemed not of this world.

Within another peak, a dignified and beautiful woman rose. Her eyes fixed on the distance and her face shifted; without hesitation she flickered and vanished.

Elsewhere, an elderly man sat cross-legged while many elite disciples listened entranced to his lecture on the Martial and Heavenly Dao.

Suddenly the old man's voice stopped. He looked in a direction, rose, and vanished in a flash, leaving his disciples bewildered.

Similar scenes played out all over the Qingyang Shrine. Whether in seclusion or not, all Emperor Realm experts sensed the terrifying surge of power and rushed from their residences toward the source, eager to see what was happening.

...

At the edge of the Qingyang Mountain Range, all seven people present, regardless of cultivation, trembled uncontrollably.

This had nothing to do with courage—it was pure suppression by overwhelming force.

The weakest—Junior Brother Fatty and the blue-faced Senior Brother—felt their bones creak; after a while both fainted on the spot.

The four First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators present all circulated their power to resist the mysterious pressure. Deacon Tao did the same, his face strained, his already short body bent over as if crushed beneath a mountain.

“What is this, what is this power!” Deacon Tao cried out in terror.

Qin Chaoyang and the other two Dao Origin Realm cultivators from Qingyang Shrine were also filled with awe and fear.

Yang Kai tried to release his Divine Sense to probe the source, only to find his consciousness could not leave his body; it felt as if space itself had been sealed!

Boom...

Suddenly, a pillar of light shot down from the sky, and a person appeared out of nowhere.

As the light faded, the figure came into view.

The newcomer wore a wide bamboo hat, tilted to shade the upper half of his face; his chin bore uneven stubble and a lazy gaze flickered from beneath the brim, lending him a strange charm.

His attire was flamboyant: a gaudy long robe and deerskin boots on a tall, broad-shouldered frame, giving him an outlandish air.

As soon as this person appeared, Qin Chaoyang’s eyes widened in surprise and delight. "Senior!"

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood—this must be the owner of the token.

Just as Yang Kai had guessed, the man's strength reached the pinnacle—definitely a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. His presence felt even stronger than when Yang Kai had met Aunt Feng.

Most crucially...

This person was not a real body, but merely a projection!

“Who... who are you!” Deacon Tao was so frightened he nearly wet himself. If not for being on his own turf, he would have already fled. Even so, he trembled all over, not daring to meet the man’s eyes as he shouted, for fear of angering him.

“Qingyang Shrine, huh...” The mysterious newcomer glanced up, muttered to himself, completely ignoring Deacon Tao. Instead, he turned to where Qin Chaoyang stood and said, “It’s only been a little over ten years, and you’ve aged so much... Looks like you’ve really been through a lot.”

“S-Senior!” Qin Chaoyang’s eyes filled with tears. After saying one sentence, he choked up and couldn’t speak further.

“Since I’m here... go ahead and make your request without worry.” The man smiled slightly, his gaze shifting until it suddenly fixed on Yang Kai. “You’re here too...?”

Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. He swallowed and said, “Does Senior know me?”

"Heh heh..." The man smiled mysteriously, acting profound, which was infuriating. His projection lasted only a few breaths before it began to dissipate. "Time's up, what a pity..."

As he spoke, the projection really did vanish before everyone’s eyes. No one knew what exactly he regretted.

As soon as the projection disappeared, all the strange phenomena vanished as well, and the terrifying pressure was gone without a trace.

Instantly, the forest was filled with the sound of people gasping for breath.

“Clatter, clatter, clatter...” Something fell to the ground.

Everyone turned to look and saw that what had fallen were the fragments of the token Deacon Tao had crushed earlier—four or five pieces in all—lying right where the mysterious expert had disappeared.

Seeing this, Deacon Tao's face turned pale. He realized at once he had made a colossal mistake.

The token he had crushed was clearly extraordinary; otherwise it would not have been used as a medium to project such a powerful expert's image.

Perhaps when that expert made the token he had already infused it with power, so that if it was destroyed a projection would appear.

"I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to!" Deacon Tao panicked, scrambling over and stumbling before finally reaching the fragments and trying to pick them up.

But the moment the fragments touched his hand they disintegrated to dust, slipping through his fingers and scattering on the wind.

"It's over, it's all over..." Deacon Tao froze in place.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

The sound of figures breaking through the air came one after another as people suddenly appeared all around.

The newcomers—old and young, men and women—arrived from every direction. Each looked solemn and on guard, but after sweeping the area with their Divine Sense they were puzzled.

The energy fluctuations and pressure they had sensed before had completely vanished!

“Ah!” The other two Dao Origin Realm cultivators from Qingyang Shrine immediately bowed in greeting when they saw these people.

“Subordinate greets the Deputy Hall Master and all Elders and Protectors!”

These people were all Emperor Realm experts—the top fighting force of Qingyang Shrine!

Yang Kai's gaze swept the group. When he saw a dignified, beautiful woman he shrank back and cursed inwardly.

That woman was none other than Gao Xueting, whom he had fought before.

Although Yang Kai had expected he might see her again at Qingyang Shrine, he had not expected it so soon.

They had met in combat before; though Yang Kai had been shrouded in Demonic Qi then, if Gao Xueting recognized him now he would be finished.

Yang Kai least wanted to encounter her...

“Who was here!” An elderly man who looked about seventy or eighty swept his stern gaze over the crowd and suddenly spoke.

This old man’s aura was as deep as the sea, clearly much stronger than Gao Xueting, and about the same as Xiao Yuyang, whom Yang Kai had met before. He should be a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert!
