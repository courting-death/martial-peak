## Chapter 1150 — It Should Be Arriving Soon

Just as Yang Kai hesitated, a figure came running from the side; when he drew near he cupped his hands and said, "Luo Qing pays respects to Young Master Yang, and greets the two young ladies."

Yang Kai looked at him and suddenly realized the man was the same Origin Returning Realm expert the Xu Family had once hired to prepare to deal with him — it was this man who had recognized him and reported to Qian Tong.

Yang Kai felt some gratitude toward Luo Qing and politely cupped his hands. "So it's Brother Luo. Where is Elder Qian now?"

"Elder Qian has some matters to handle and cannot leave at present, so he instructed his disciple to wait here for Young Master Yang. Rest assured, Elder Qian has arranged everything — the three of you only need to follow me," Luo Qing explained.

"Very well, lead the way." Yang Kai nodded.

The Jubao Tower was holding an auction in Tianyun City; Qian Tong was a major figure in Tianyun City, so it was only natural he had matters to attend to — Yang Kai did not read too much into it.

Following Luo Qing, they went straight up to the third floor and pushed open the door of a private chamber. Luo Qing stood at the entrance with his hands lowered and said, "Young Master Yang, this is the box Elder Qian arranged for you. Please see if it meets your approval."

Yang Kai stepped inside and found the room small but well-appointed: a table and chairs, a plate of decent spirit fruit on the table, and a pot of steaming spirit tea. Two pretty maidservants stood to one side attending — bright-eyed, fair-toothed, slender — and upon seeing Yang Kai and the others enter, they immediately offered a graceful bow.

Yang Kai did not know whether other private rooms were similarly attended, but he was certain these two maidservants had been specially arranged by Qian Tong — they wore Yingyue Hall's garments and were clearly disciples of Yingyue Hall.

"Elder Qian is thoughtful; I'm very pleased," Yang Kai said with a smile and a nod.

Luo Qing seemed to relax. He had personally seen Qian Tong, in an effort to curry favor with Yang Kai, kill Senior Brother Hong Zhen and his companion. Although Luo Qing still did not understand what outstanding quality Yang Kai possessed to merit such courtship, he executed Qian Tong's orders without the slightest laxity.

"By the way, Young Master Yang, Elder Qian instructed me to take the items you plan to auction over quickly. Jubao Tower needs to assess the auction items' prices so they can be ordered appropriately."

"No problem." Yang Kai gave Wu Yi a look. Wu Yi immediately retrieved two finely wrapped jade boxes from her Spatial Ring and handed them to Luo Qing — the two boxes naturally containing the two Origin-Grade secret treasures.

"And this." Yang Kai then produced a jade vial and handed it to Luo Qing.

"Young Master Yang, please wait a moment. The auction will begin in half an hour; I shall take my leave." Luo Qing said as he stepped back, and before departing he instructed the two Yingyue Hall maid disciples to take good care of Yang Kai. The two nodded and promised to do so.

"We're in Room C-13." Wu Yi went over and closed the door; the clamor outside vanished at once.

"The formation set-up here is quite good." Yang Yan paced around, feeling and inspecting the place; she was very particular about the formations. "This can block others' Divine Sense probes. The only drawback is it's a bit far from the auction area."

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "This is Jubao Tower. Elder Qian must have expended great effort to secure us a private room. Look at those who came today — which of them isn't a renowned, formidable figure?"

He spoke those words to the two Yingyue Hall maid disciples. As expected, their smiles grew even brighter, as if their Elder Qian were exceptionally mighty.

"Two young ladies, no need to be so formal — sit where you like. We're not from any great clan; we're mainly here to see the world," Yang Kai said kindly, seeing that they appeared somewhat nervous.

The two women waved their hands repeatedly and insisted they dared not.

Yang Kai did not press them. When they refused he fell silent, sat down, and poured himself a cup of tea, savoring it slowly while he waited.

Wu Yi still could not believe it. She could not imagine having the chance to take part in an auction of this caliber. Let alone her — even Ian, the Family Head of the Haike Family, would not be allowed into Jubao Tower while the auction was underway.

Yet here she was, sitting in a private chamber, boldly enjoying preferential treatment. It stirred feelings in her — the gap between people was truly vast. Her greatest wish had once been to prove herself so Ian would look on her differently and, in time, pass the Family Head position to her to lead the Haike Family; now she no longer had that thought.

So what if he was a Family Head? The head of a minor family wasn’t even comparable to a random disciple from Shadow Moon Hall. Take the two young women attending to them in the private room — though their cultivation was only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, if they were to appear in the Haike Family, Ian would have to receive them with utmost respect, not daring to slight them in the least.

This was the immense gap between great powers and small clans.

A few days earlier, while Yang Kai had been in seclusion, Ian had come to the cave, even bringing the family's guest elders to request Wu Yi return to take up the Family Head position — but Wu Yi had politely declined. Since she had already left the family, she had no intention of returning.

Lost in thought, she suddenly felt a gust of wind. Quick of eye and hand, Wu Yi reached out and grabbed the thing hurtling toward her — it turned out to be one of the spirit fruits from the table.

Yang Kai smiled. "What idle thoughts are you having?"

"Nothing." Wu Yi shook her head, picked up another spirit fruit, stood, and handed them to the two Yingyue Hall maid disciples.

The two maid disciples did not refuse this time; they politely thanked her and received the fruit with composed grace.

The auction still had some time before it began, and the atmosphere in the private room warmed considerably. The two Yingyue Hall maid disciples seemed to have noticed that Yang Kai and his two companions were not of high birth and were amiable, and they began chatting casually with Wu Yi and Yang Yan, addressing each other as sisters. Yang Kai had no place in the conversation, so he picked up the catalog on the table to examine the items to be auctioned that day.

At the same time, in a secret room within the Jubao Tower, a stern-faced old man with a goatee shouted at Qian Tong in dissatisfaction, “Old Qian, it’s about to start — where are the items you said you wanted to consign for auction?”

Qian Tong glanced out and replied uncertainly, "They should be arriving soon. Wait a bit longer."

"Wait a bit longer? Jubao Tower has rules. If it weren't for our acquaintance, do you think I'd casually break protocol and insert auction items before the auction begins? Is that appropriate?" the old man snapped.

“Not appropriate, not appropriate,” Qian Tong said with a forced smile, though he was muttering inwardly. A few days ago, Wu Yi had specially come to see him, saying she had something to consign for auction. He hadn’t asked what exactly it was, only knew it was a Secret Treasure. For Yang Kai’s sake, Qian Tong had readily agreed, saying it would be fine as long as the item was delivered before the auction began. Who would have thought that even now it still hadn’t arrived? Left with no choice, he said politely, “Brother Yan Pei, just wait a little longer — it’ll definitely be delivered.”

Yan Pei's already dark face darkened further like the bottom of a pot. After a moment's thought he said, "Don't say I don't look out for you. If, after half an incense stick's time, they still haven't arrived, then even the most precious items will not be allowed to participate in the auction."

"I know, I know. Thank you, Brother Yan Pei," Qian Tong replied with a helpless smile. Jubao Tower's rules were many and he had no choice. As he spoke, his communication compass suddenly transmitted a Divine Sense fluctuation — it was Luo Qing sending a message. Qian Tong's expression brightened: "They're here."

With that, he immediately went outside.

Moments later, someone entered carrying a jade vial and two jade boxes.

Yan Pei snapped, "These are the items?"

"They should be," Qian Tong replied. He did not open them to see what was inside; time was pressing, and after taking the items from Luo Qing he had immediately brought them in.

"Open them and take a look; assess the price and decide when it would be most appropriate to auction them," Yan Pei said coldly. He waved his hand and a few Origin Returning Realm experts stepped forward, placed the jade boxes and vial on the table, formed a ring, and began evaluating the items' value.

Seeing Qian Tong looking uneasy, Yan Pei sneered, "Brother Qian, you haven't just brought some worthless trinkets to auction, have you? If so, you had better take them back immediately."

"How could that be?" Qian Tong said awkwardly. "Is it not acceptable to auction Saint King-Grade Upper-Level secret treasures?"

Because it had been Wu Yi who had greeted him, Qian Tong felt uncertain. Had Yang Kai greeted him personally, he would not have been so restless. Yang Kai had the backing of a master artificer, and Qian Tong's claim that the items were Saint King-Grade Upper-Level secret treasures stemmed from his faith in Yang Kai's master — such an artificer would never produce shabby goods.

"Saint King-Grade Upper-Level secret treasures..." Yan Pei's expression cleared slightly, and with gravity he said, "Of course that's acceptable. But Brother Qian, you mustn't do this again; I'm responsible here, and if someone finds out I won't be able to explain it to those above."

Although Saint King-Grade Upper-Level secret treasures were not the highest tier, they were perhaps the most mainstream on Dark Star. Origin-Grade artificers were few; warriors of the Saint King and Origin Returning realms mostly used treasures of this grade, so there was never any shortage of buyers. Jubao Tower had gathered many such treasures for this auction; two more made little difference.

As the two old men spoke, a cry of surprise suddenly rose nearby.

"What's the matter?" Yan Pei turned to look.

"My lord, the item entering the auction is an Origin-Grade Lower-Level offensive Secret Treasure." An Origin Returning Realm expert promptly carried over a jade box and presented the double-forked weapon inside to Qian Tong and Yan Pei.

Qian Tong's eyelids twitched; an inexplicable pang of pain seized him.

Although he had long suspected Yang Kai's master was an Origin-Grade artificer, he had never expected such-grade treasures would be put up for auction. Had he known earlier he would have arranged to purchase them directly from Yang Kai. He had done business in secret treasures with Yang Kai twice before, each time amicably; now that the items were in Jubao Tower's hands, if he wanted them he'd have to join the bidding.

Participating in an auction was far more expensive than a private purchase, and success was not guaranteed. Jubao Tower teemed with the wealthy and powerful; they often fought to the death over a prized item.
