## Chapter 1437 — Undying Five Elements Sword Qi

Hearing Ye Xijun say that, Chang Qi and the others all looked momentarily stunned.

He didn't die… that meant the ascent had succeeded!

Chang Qi and the others could hardly believe their ears, but since Ye Xijun said it, her words carried authority, and no one dared question them; one by one they turned to gaze at Tianyi Palace with delight.

Just as Ye Xijun finished speaking, the spiritual qi above Tianyi Palace suddenly shifted again, those currents of qi gathering swiftly and then coalescing into a massive hand.

It overshadowed heaven and earth; from that palm came a strange power that seemed capable of blotting out all light before everyone's eyes.

The palm clenched fiercely, seizing the few remaining strands of multicolored spiritual qi like fishes that had slipped through the net, then slowly withdrew, slipping into Tianyi Palace and vanishing.

Seeing this, Ye Xijun was greatly astonished, yet the smile at the corner of her mouth deepened threefold as she murmured, "This brat…"

He actually wouldn't waste even those final strands of multicolored spiritual qi; when they failed to flow into his body, he reached out and snatched them back. Having the leisure to do such a thing meant everything over there had gone smoothly, Ye Xijun couldn't help but smile wryly.

"Alright, disperse for now; there's no need to worry about Yang Kai over there," Yang Yan called out in a loud voice, finally exhaling at this moment.

"Yes!" Chang Qi and the others replied respectfully and quickly withdrew.

"Great Elder, he just broke through and still needs time to stabilize his realm; please keep watch over this place," Yang Yan instructed Ye Xijun.

"Yes, Lord!" Ye Xijun bowed slightly; she obeyed Yang Yan's orders without hesitation.

Yang Yan glanced once toward Tianyi Palace, a smile at her lips, then vanished from where she stood; with the Imperial Garden soon to open and Yang Kai unable to step away, all matters of the Lingxiao Sect would fall to her. Fortunately, with Wu Yi, Qian Yue and the others assisting, it would not be too difficult.

Inside Tianyi Palace, Yang Kai was rags and tatters, his clothes torn and stained with the dry traces of pale golden blood, his hair disheveled, looking utterly bedraggled, as if he had just survived a life‑and‑death battle.

Yet his expression was joyful, his face relaxed and content.

He had not expected this ascension to go so smoothly.

After obtaining the Dayan Divine Sand and assembling the Five Elements treasures, Yang Kai began to cultivate the Undying Five Elements Sword, not expecting to reach any great level—he only intended to become slightly familiar with it.

He never imagined that once he started it would be uncontrollable.

In nearly five months, he had cultivated the Undying Five Elements Sword to the First Stage; not only had his fleshly strength increased greatly, but his Saint Yuan and Divine Sense had also improved—overall his combat power rose by at least ten to twenty percent!

That ten to twenty percent increase brought him to the threshold of the Origin Returning Realm, touching the shackles at the peak of the Saint King Realm.

He then paused his training of the Undying Five Elements Sword and began absorbing the spirit energy of the refined spirits in his Sea of Consciousness.

In the battle at Dragon Lair Mountain many Origin Returning Realm experts died; the souls of those Origin Returning Realm fighters were mostly drawn into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, purified by the world‑ending golden light, though he had not yet dealt with them.

After consuming the spirit energies of these fighters and obtaining their insights into the Martial Dao, his breakthrough became a natural consequence.

However, this breakthrough was somewhat different from before—he had never once seen multicolored spiritual qi converge like that, and Yang Kai did not know the reason; he faintly suspected it was related to his training of the Undying Five Elements Sword.

Overall, this breakthrough was a fortunate coincidence, a ripening of circumstances—completely unlike his previous plans. He had sequestered himself to ascend, intending to break through, even preparing an Origin Condensing Pill with pill patterns.

But man's plans do not match heaven's; all those preparations were unused.

This was a good thing, and it naturally filled Yang Kai with boundless joy.

Now the Undying Five Elements Sword had reached its First Stage. Still, the legendary fleshly immortality of the art remained extremely distant—the technique had nine stages, each harder than the last. To reach its summit who knew how much time and how many Five Elements treasures it would consume!

After reaching the First Stage, Yang Kai checked his remaining Five Elements treasures; the highest grade Sun's True Essence seemed unchanged, but the others were less satisfactory.

The primordial power within Xuan Gold had diminished greatly, Thundertree likewise, the Profound Yin Moon Water had decreased by three drops, and the Dayan Divine Sand had lessened by more than twenty grains…

Such a cost was not small, but it didn't matter; the remaining materials were sufficient to support his cultivation to the Second or even Third Stage, especially the Sun's True Essence, which should last for a very long time.

With ample time as a buffer, he could seek other Five Elements substitutes.

There was no rush for that matter.

Thinking this, Yang Kai extended a hand and, with a thought, a multicolored orb suddenly appeared in his palm.

The orb was only the size of an egg and consisted of five layers—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—intertwined in brilliance, exquisitely beautiful.

Undying Five Elements Sword qi! One of the fruits of five months' cultivation; this defiant body‑tempering method not only reforged the flesh and greatly strengthened the body, but also produced the remarkable Undying Five Elements Sword qi.

The sword qi was formed from the convergence of the Five Elements—it could merge and flow together, or be unleashed separately. Its applications were boundless, its transformations ever-changing.

Yet the sword qi in his hand was still somewhat weak, like a hatchling that had just broken shell and could not yet withstand storms; used in a duel it would probably not be decisive.

That did not stop Yang Kai from wanting to test it.

With a flick of his Divine Sense the multicolored orb shot forth a golden beam, which twisted before Yang Kai and formed into a small golden sword.

Though small, the blade contained a sharpness not to be underestimated; refined from the primordial essence of Xuan Gold, this metal‑attribute Undying Sword Qi possessed fierce offensive power.

"Go!" Yang Kai exhaled and pointed; the little golden sword trembled and then vanished, instantly piercing through the residual sealing of Tianyi Palace and flying several li away. With his Divine Sense locking onto it, Yang Kai clearly watched its trajectory and couldn't help lifting an eyebrow in satisfaction.

He had not tested its lethality, but its speed was exceedingly fast and hard to guard against.

At another thought, the golden sword returned, responding like an extension of his arm, connected to his mind.

In high spirits, Yang Kai tested the remaining four types of Undying Sword Qi one by one and was thoroughly pleased.

The five types of Undying Sword Qi each had their own strengths; neither could be said strictly superior. The metal sword and the fire sword excelled at killing—the former sharp and swift, the latter terrifyingly powerful.

The earth sword and the water sword favored defense—the former dense and solid, the latter soft and boundless.

The wooden sword was relatively balanced, embodying both offense and defense—but it was by no means to be underestimated.

Moreover, once the five strands of Undying Sword Qi were cultivated to a sufficient level, they could form the Undying Five Elements Sword Formation. Within this formation, the powers of the Five Elements nurtured and restrained one another, cycling endlessly, ceaseless and eternal. Unless all five strands of Undying Sword Qi were shattered in an instant, even an opponent a one Stage higher would suffer greatly if trapped within.

After delightfully playing and testing them for a long time, Yang Kai stored the Undying Five Elements Sword qi within his body. Though the art was mighty, its results could not be displayed overnight; it required time and accumulation.

Yang Kai was mentally prepared for that.

Having now reached the Origin Returning Realm, his strength was incomparable to before—his whole being seemed filled with power and every movement carried tremendous authority.

This was the Origin Returning Realm, the pinnacle realm on Dark Star!

From the moment he first set foot in the Star Domain to now had been a decade or two; once he had been only a minor figure at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, and now he had crossed two great realms—such speed of cultivation was rare.

Though Wei Guchang and Xuan'er and others looked about the same age as Yang Kai, in truth they were much older—martial power kept appearances from aging, and great strength resisted the flow of years.

Figures like Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were each existences who had lived for centuries.

Composing himself, Yang Kai did not grow arrogant; the Origin Returning Realm was only one realm among many—above it lay the Void King Realm! There were even higher realms; for example, the Starry Sky Emperor stood far beyond the Void King Realm.

Since he had not yet walked that path, Yang Kai could not touch those deeper secrets.

There remained many things to cultivate, all of which would take time.

The Golden Blood Threads were easy enough—using Golden Blood to condense them would not take long; once formed and nourished within the body, the longer they matured the greater their power.

The Dragon Bone Dripping Jade need not trouble Yang Kai; the Fire Bird artifact spirit would help refine it.

The World‑Ending Demon Eye had also been gradually fusing with the Glazed Pearl; over time the world‑ending golden light and the Glazed Light would slowly become one.

Yang Kai needed time—he only had two secret arts he cultivated himself, the Space Blade and the Undying Five Elements Sword!

Having many techniques was no burden; Yang Kai was not troubled. These secret arts and means concerned his future, but he would not add new ones—he would perfect what he already had, and then the world would be his to roam.

With that thought he closed his eyes, grasped an Origin Saint Crystal in each hand, and began to stabilize his realm.

A newly attained realm was perilous; if one did not immediately consolidate it, a single mistake could cause a fall.

A few hurried days passed!

One day Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, frowned as he looked outward, probed for a moment with his Divine Sense, then rose and strode out of Tianyi Palace, where he had been secluded for half a year.

At this moment the vast plaza of the Lingxiao Sect was filled with martial artists—members of the Lingxiao Sect as well as figures like Qian Tong and others.

All gazed upward, their eyes drawn to something in the sky, each wearing a solemn expression.
