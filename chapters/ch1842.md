## Chapter 1842 — Strange Flower Rain

Xia Jingwu, stroking his beard, said, "Yao Qing, don't be impulsive. As for that youth's true strength, I can't fully see through it, but if he could send Deacon Min flying with a single palm, then he is absolutely not someone you can seize. Even if our entire Commerce Guild joined together, we would likely not be his match. If you go provoke him now, you'll only be inviting humiliation."

Yao Qing's face grew awkward as he thought for a moment and realized Xia Jingwu was right; he couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.

Hua Youmeng smiled bitterly and looked at Xia Jingwu. "This first option won't do. Uncle Xia, explain the second option instead."

Xia Jingwu sighed. "I knew the Head would never agree to the first option."

What kind of temperament Hua Youmeng possessed — how could Xia Jingwu not know? She was born with a righteous and warm heart. Having stood up for Yang Kai outside the city gate, how could she now hand him over to face judgment from Purple Star City? If she truly did such a thing, then she would no longer be Hua Youmeng.

"Since handing him over is impossible, we must choose the second path to avoid calamity," Xia Jingwu said in a deep voice. "Please, Head, take some people and leave the Commerce Guild at once; leave this place to me to manage."

Hua Youmeng started at his words and cried out in shock, "Uncle Xia, you are..."

"Since this mess has been stirred up, someone must take responsibility. Purple Star City will not let this go easily. In truth, we should never have entered the city; leaving immediately would have been the wisest choice, but once everyone was distracted and we were already inside, getting out now will be like climbing to the sky. For the present, drastic measures are required. I am unworthy, but the Head has cared for me for years; I am willing to serve and die for the Head." Xia Jingwu rose to his feet, the short body straightening, giving the impression of someone prepared to exhaust himself in service and die thereafter.

"I'll stay with Uncle Xia!" Yao Qing jumped to his feet.

"I'll stay too!" Outside the door, the comely woman called Hong Jie entered gracefully and said in a low voice.

"No!" Hua Youmeng's face flickered through several shades as she vetoed them outright.

"Ha, indeed that's not possible. If you all stay, who will assist the Head after? Our Five Directions Commerce Guild will likely be finished for good. So you must go; take some of the Guild's valuable goods and depart. I will remain here alone to shoulder this burden," Xia Jingwu said with a faint smile, as if life and death meant nothing to him. "Besides, I have some dealings with a certain official in Purple Star City; if I beg him, perhaps our lives can be spared."

"No!" Hua Youmeng shook her head. "If Purple Star City truly intends to make an example of us, I cannot not be here. If anyone is to remain, it will be me. You all leave."

The room erupted into an irreconcilable quarrel; no one could persuade anyone else.

Xia Jingwu pounded his thigh in despair. "Head, there's little time. If you keep quibbling with me, none of us will be able to leave. Do you want me to kneel and beg you? Fine — I will kneel and beg you!"

Saying that, he actually fell to his knees before Hua Youmeng.

"Uncle Xia!" Hua Youmeng's face changed drastically; she sprang from her chair and in the next moment stood before him.

Just as she reached out to help him up, Xia Jingwu suddenly raised his hand and scattered a cloud of powder straight toward Hua Youmeng.

Hua Youmeng had never expected Xia Jingwu to strike her at such a moment. Caught unawares, she inhaled a little of the powder; in the next moment her whole body went limp and she looked at Xia Jingwu blankly. "Flowery Rain Powder!" she said.

"Uncle Xia, what are you doing?" Yao Qing roared when he saw something amiss and lunged at Xia Jingwu with furious momentum.

"Stop!" The woman called Hong Jie had seen through the ruse. In a single step she blocked Yao Qing and pulled Hua Youmeng into her arms.

"Uncle Xia..." Hua Youmeng, weak and powerless though she was, had not fainted.

Xia Jingwu chuckled. "Since the Head recognized this Flowery Rain Powder, she surely knows its effect. Even if you, Head, are a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator, you won't be able to use Saint Yuan within an hour!"

While speaking he barked an order: "Gao Hong, take the Head away from the Commerce Guild at once and hide her somewhere safe and secret in the city. When the heat dies down, find a way to leave Purple Star!"

The woman's body trembled, tears gleaming in her beautiful eyes as she looked at Xia Jingwu and bowed heavily, "Uncle Xia, rest assured — even if Gao Hong dies, I will protect the Head completely!"

"Yao Qing, Haitang, you two leave as well!" Xia Jingwu turned his head and commanded.

Yao Qing and the twenty-something woman both nodded.

Yao Qing, a man as tough as iron, couldn’t help but have his eyes well up with tears at this moment. “Uncle Xia, please… take good care of yourself.”

"Ha, don't worry, I will not die," Xia Jingwu said with a calm smile, waving to them.

Urged on by him, Gao Hong finally cradled Hua Youmeng, and with Yao Qing and Haitang the group darted out like fish to leave the Five Directions Commerce Guild and that place of trouble.

"Loyal and righteous — these little Guild people are rather interesting," Yang Kai murmured with a hint of approval as he sat cross-legged in his room, his brow lifting slightly.

Although he remained inside the side chamber, he had still observed every detail of the earlier dispute among the members of the Five Directions Commerce Guild. Among them, Hua Youmeng was the strongest, possessing the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. The others varied in strength, but with his own Second Stage Void King Realm cultivation, none of them could possibly detect his probing.

"Hmm, the situation differs slightly from my expectation," Yang Kai said, rubbing his forehead. His original plan had been to slip into Purple Star City, and under Zi Donglai's guidance make off with items from Purple Star's Treasure Vault.

With his cards and mighty cultivation, he was confident he could complete the theft without anyone noticing; even if discovered, he could fight his way out.

It was only the encounter at the city gate that foiled his plan.

He also knew that whoever had offended Purple Star City would not get off lightly; although he feared nothing himself, the people of the Five Directions Commerce Guild would likely suffer.

So when, after entering the city, Hua Youmeng had unwittingly invited him to the Commerce Guild, Yang Kai had readily agreed.

She had stepped forward for him and thus courted this trouble; he could not simply turn away.

Now the Commerce Guild's people dreaming of escape were only fooling themselves.

"They're here!" Yang Kai frowned and spread his Divine Sense outward. In the next moment he sensed many cultivators arriving at the Guild; they burst in and began smashing and looting without mercy. Many cultivators buying goods fled in panic while the shop assistants were beaten to the ground, howls of agony echoing.

Gao Hong and the others who had just left the back courtyard had no time to run before confronting several overwhelmingly powerful auras racing toward them.

One of them shouted angrily, "You injured my Purple Star City guard and think to flee? Your Five Directions Commerce Guild has gone lawless!"

As the words fell, a punch slammed forward.

Gao Hong took the blow head-on. Her pretty face changed as she hurriedly moved the cradled Hua Youmeng behind her, using her own back to shield against the assault.

Yao Qing and Haitang cried out and hastily produced secret treasures to blunt the ferocity of the attack.

Boom... A tremendous roar followed; much of the Commerce Guild's back courtyard was destroyed. Gao Hong, Yao Qing, and Haitang were blasted backward, spitting blood in midair, and when they fell their faces were ashen and bloodless.

Rumble, rumble...

From the front gate streamed countless armored cultivators, each bearing long spears; they quickly encircled the back courtyard.

A hulking figure strode forward from the head of the formation, hands folded behind his back, face carrying an air of calm authority rather than fury.

"Lord Bai!" When Xia Jingwu saw the newcomer, his face changed drastically and he hurried forward with cupped hands to greet him.

With one glance he recognized him as one of Purple Star City's Deputy Commanders, Bai Zhengchu.

The Purple Star City guards were led by Commander Lu Tianfeng, a Void King Realm expert, with eight Deputy Commanders under him. Each deputy was at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm and they managed the city's peace and handled disputes.

Bai Zhengchu was one of those Deputies. He would never concern himself with petty affairs, but this time the injured Deacon Min had prompted him to come to the Five Directions Commerce Guild.

Seeing this man arrive, Xia Jingwu realized the situation had turned grave.

Rumor said Bai Zhengchu was the most violent of the eight Deputies, ruthless and merciless. Any merchant he set his sights on would see their family destroyed. In his years as Deputy, the businesses he wiped out numbered not less than eighty; their shops were sealed and their people wiped out.

Xia Jingwu trembled like a sieve, thinking this time the Five Directions Commerce Guild might truly be doomed.

"Get out!" Bai Zhengchu did not even spare him a glance; he shouted, the sound coalescing into a line that struck Xia Jingwu's body, making him collapse, wounded by the hidden blow.

In the back courtyard all the Commerce Guild people looked ashen and worn, despair covering their eyes; the guards from Purple Star City wore malicious expressions that made them feel as if they had fallen into an ice cellar.

Bai Zhengchu turned to look around and snorted coldly, "The Five Directions Commerce Guild — hah, it has no further reason to exist."

At those words everyone's faces changed wildly; Bai Zhengchu's sentence was tantamount to passing the Guild's death sentence.

Cradled in Gao Hong's arms, Hua Youmeng whispered weakly, "Lord Bai, there has been some misunderstanding. Could you... allow me to explain?"

Bai Zhengchu cast his gaze toward Hua Youmeng and snorted, "There is no need for explanations. From today the Five Directions Commerce Guild is sealed. All its people will be thrown into Purple Star's Cold Prison."

"Purple Star's Cold Prison!" Gao Hong cried out in alarm.

The Cold Prison in Purple Star City was notorious, a place used solely to detain criminals, and no one who had ever entered it had a precedent of walking out alive.

Once you went in, life there was worse than death.

"You two are rather comely," Bai Zhengchu reached out and touched Hua Youmeng and Gao Hong, saying casually, "Very well. You can accompany the brothers for a while; I'll give you a pleasurable time and you won't have to suffer in the Cold Prison."

His tone was indifferent, but his words sent a chill down one’s spine.

Gao Hong and Hua Youmeng both turned pale, while the surrounding guards leered wickedly, clearly not unfamiliar with such deeds.
