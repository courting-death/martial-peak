## Chapter 644 — Anomaly

Li Rong's expression flickered constantly; her dark brows knit lightly, a look of puzzled contemplation on her face.

This human brat dared to boldly absorb more than a dozen clusters of Divine Sense Fire into his Sea of Consciousness, and yet showed no sign of discomfort — his Sea of Consciousness must be hiding some secret that can suppress the harm of the Divine Sense Fire.

The mature, dignified beauty could not help but be curious.

After a moment of thought, she waved her hand and cast a barrier that sealed the entire stone chamber, then drifted to sit opposite Yang Kai and extended a slender, jade-like hand; her flawless forefinger touched Yang Kai’s forehead lightly.

The next moment, a hidden Divine Sense force burst forth from Li Rong’s Sea of Consciousness and rushed into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

She wanted to see with her own eyes what this human was hiding.

Within the Sea of Consciousness, a scorching aura filled the space; even the sea of water below seemed to be boiling, leaping like burning flames.

Li Rong quietly surveyed the scene inside the Sea of Consciousness, and waves of shock rose in her heart.

She clearly felt the strangeness and might of this Sea of Consciousness: this human, only at the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage, actually possessed Divine Sense power that in no way fell short of a Transcendent Realm expert.

Although Yang Kai had once displayed Divine Sense power in her presence, Li Rong discovered that time he had still held back.

What a crafty human!

Somewhere in that void, a Spirit Body floated silently; Li Rong immediately recognized it as the human's Spirit Body.

Before it, more than a dozen blazing Divine Sense Fires that contained destructive might darted about uncontrollably, tossing up turmoil in this Sea of Consciousness and making it look as if it might be destroyed at any moment.

Li Rong could not help but feel some worry.

"Lady Li, peeking into another's mind like this isn't proper, is it?" Suddenly the human's Spirit Body turned, eyes glittering as they fixed on her hidden location.

Li Rong paused, smiling wryly; she had assumed that with her strength she could slip into his Sea of Consciousness without being noticed, but she did not expect him to be so alert and highly vigilant.

Since she had been discovered, Li Rong made no attempt to remain hidden; she openly manifested her Spirit Body, flew to Yang Kai’s side, and spoke earnestly, "Sorry, I could not restrain my curiosity. I wanted to see what method you have to devour these more-than-a-dozen clusters of Divine Sense Fire. After all, this counts as Mo Shen Fort's investment in you; as the owner of Mo Shen Fort, do I not have some right to inspect?"

"Lady Li, is this mistrust?" Yang Kai grinned.

"A little," Li Rong said with a faint smile. "We do not yet know each other well, and past lessons teach caution; it is not excessive for me to be careful."

Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

"Then now, will you show me your method? Don't worry, I will only watch quietly and not interfere." Li Rong gestured; she was clearly still worried that Yang Kai might fail to swallow the Divine Sense Fire and be destroyed, so she intended to personally stay to support him — with her formidable cultivation she might be able to save him if something went wrong.

Although he sensed her goodwill, Yang Kai still shook his head slowly. "Everyone has secrets, Lady Li. You entered my Sea of Consciousness and I did not drive you out because I trusted you would not casually pry into my secrets, since you are a woman worthy of respect and trust. So it's better not to force the issue."

To devour Divine Sense Fire, he had to use the power of the Golden Pupil Eye.

The instant he sensed Li Rong's intrusion, Yang Kai had concealed the Golden Pupil Eye and the Warm Spirit Lotus.

These were secrets he did not wish anyone to know; unless Li Rong deliberately probed, she would not discover them.

Li Rong was visibly taken aback by Yang Kai's unreserved praise; a subtle, awkward expression flitted across her pretty face — after all, she had sneaked in, and his compliment left her feeling somewhat guilty.

"Truly impossible?" Li Rong bit her red lip and asked stubbornly.

Yang Kai shook his head firmly.

Li Rong sighed and said, "Very well, I won't make things difficult for you. Be careful."

Saying so, a powerful Divine Sense force burst from her Spirit Body and wrapped around the more-than-a-dozen darting Divine Sense Fires.

Her action had no hostility; she only wished to do as much as possible to help Yang Kai before leaving.

Yang Kai understood and did not stop her.

What happened next was shocking — the Golden Pupil Eye that Yang Kai had concealed revealed itself of its own accord the moment Li Rong's Spirit Body released its power.

Uncontrolled by Yang Kai, the Golden Pupil Eye slowly opened its eyelid.

Endless majesty descended; even the powerful Li Rong could not help trembling, and her Spirit Body felt as if it were about to collapse.

The golden, narrow pupil appeared, its majesty inspiring a feeling of worship.

The more-than-a-dozen unstable Divine Sense Fires instantly met their nemesis; they all quieted and clustered together, unusually still.

Li Rong's eyes widened; the world around her became nothing but dazzling gold.

Yang Kai's face changed drastically; he strained to communicate with the Golden Pupil Eye but received no response.

A thread of golden light shot from the Golden Pupil Eye and shone upon the Divine Sense Fires, purifying all the impurities they contained. The golden light's power did not weaken and struck Li Rong's Spirit Body directly.

Yang Kai stood there dumbfounded, stunned into silence.

Li Rong was motionless as well; her Spirit Body gradually faded and soon disappeared entirely.

Only after Li Rong's Spirit Body had vanished did the Golden Pupil Eye slowly close; Yang Kai stared at it in shock, his expression sour.

After a long moment Yang Kai cursed under his breath; it was too late to devour those purified Divine Sense Fires, so he hurriedly retreated his Spirit Body out of his Sea of Consciousness.

Rushing to open his eyes, Yang Kai saw Li Rong sitting before him — her eyes wide and fixed in a rigid pose, a slender jade finger still pressed against his forehead, her body slick with fragrant sweat as if tormented by a nightmare; her beautiful eyes were full of terror and her face as white as snow.

Releasing his Divine Sense and detecting that the stone chamber had been sealed, Yang Kai finally relaxed a little.

He knew the Golden Pupil Eye's destructive power better than anyone; being struck by it could very well kill one on the spot.

This woman was the owner of Mo Shen Fort — if she died before him, he would have no way to explain. Then there would be no need to think about alchemy or finding Su Yan and Little Junior Sister: Han Fei and Hua Mo would certainly tear him to pieces to avenge Li Rong.

Steadying his mind, Yang Kai probed Li Rong with his Divine Sense and was astonished to find she was completely unharmed.

Although she wore a face of extreme fright, neither her Divine Sense nor her mortal body showed the slightest injury; only she seemed to be in a chaotic, unconscious state.

What was going on? Yang Kai was baffled.

Every time the Golden Pupil Eye exerted its power it brought immense killing force; any alien Divine Sense entering Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness would be destroyed and purified — yet this time Li Rong had suffered no harm.

Was it that her cultivation was too high? Or was there some other reason?

In any case, Li Rong being safe put Yang Kai in a better mood.

Squinting, he glanced at the dazed, seated beauty before him and his aura turned dangerous.

Li Rong had definitely seen the Golden Pupil Eye earlier; Yang Kai considered whether to silence her forever.

After a long while he shook his head and abandoned the vicious urge.

Killing Li Rong would bring him trouble and was not worth the risk.

Sitting down again, Yang Kai took a deep breath. Noises came from outside the chamber as people from Mo Shen Fort sensed something amiss and converged here, and the calls from Guan'er sounded in his ears from time to time.

Yang Kai pretended not to hear.

After waiting for a while with no change from Li Rong, Yang Kai stopped paying attention to her and immersed his consciousness in his Sea of Consciousness to begin absorbing those Divine Sense Fires.

The reason Yang Kai wanted these more-than-a-dozen Divine Sense Fires was because he had read in some tomes that a cultivator possessing Divine Sense Fire could fuse the Divine Sense Fire of others to enhance his own might.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire had been born from the True Spirit within that piece of jade, so its heat was relatively weak; if he could swallow the power of others, his Divine Sense Fire would become far more ferocious.

This would be of great benefit both to his own future strength and to his alchemical work.

So when he learned that Li Rong and the others possessed more than a dozen Divine Sense Fires, Yang Kai could not help being tempted.

The absorption proceeded simply and easily, yet the entire Sea of Consciousness underwent dramatic change.

The seawater burning like flames became denser and more substantial, and the scorching power rose by several levels; this Divine Sense Fire had now become incomparable to his original.

The gain was tremendous, and Yang Kai was greatly pleased.

When he retreated his consciousness once more, he found Li Rong had awakened; as always she was mature and composed, her clear eyes flashing with calm wisdom, though her face bore confusion and bewilderment.

Their eyes met; Li Rong seemed a bit startled and quickly averted her gaze.

"Are you all right?" Yang Kai asked.

Li Rong shook her head slowly.

"You saw it just now?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

Li Rong hesitated and nodded slightly, then quickly added, "You need not worry; I will not speak of what I saw."

"Oh?" Yang Kai's expression took on a playful tone.

She was so eager to declare her stance, as if deliberately trying to show goodwill, which made Yang Kai uneasy; he did not know why she would say that.

"You do not trust me?" Li Rong frowned. "I can swear by the name of the Great Demon God that everything seen just now, before your permission, I will not tell a second person!"
