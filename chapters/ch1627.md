## Chapter 1627 — Su Yan

Ran Yunting looked the woman up and down and allowed a trace of approval to show on her face. "Not bad. Judging by your appearance, your Ice Jade Skill has made progress again; my investment in you was not in vain—I even broke precedent to transmit this divine art to you."

The woman's expression betrayed neither joy nor sorrow; since stepping in she had not shifted a single feature. Coldness radiated from her body as if she truly were a block of ice.

At the remark, the woman said, "Master's favor is great; your disciple dares not be negligent."

"Very well, sit!" Ran Yunting inclined her head slightly and indicated an Ice Jade Meditation Cushion before her.

Today was the monthly day for resolving doubts. Every month on this day the woman came to Master Ran Yunting's residence to pay respects and to have her questions and confusions about cultivation explained.

The two of them had obviously been through this countless times, so the woman, familiar with the routine, obediently took her seat.

"Have you encountered any obscure points in your recent cultivation?" Ran Yunting asked in a kindly tone.

Although the master's cultivation was two Stages higher than her disciple's, at her current rate of progress it would likely take only a few years before the disciple could stand shoulder to shoulder; in time she might even reach the height of a Grand Elder. Ran Yunting placed great expectations on her and showed no impatience.

The woman lightly nodded and was about to speak when the corner of her eye suddenly caught sight of a portrait hanging on the icy wall behind Ran Yunting.

Her slight frame trembled violently. Normally as calm as a still well—one who would not be moved even if the sky fell—she revealed an expression of utter shock; a brilliant light flared in her eyes as she stared unblinkingly at the figure in the portrait.

Her expression turned wildly complex: there was delight, disbelief, confusion… emotions flickering in rapid succession.

Yet in the space of a blink she had reined in her oddity.

"You know this person?" Ran Yunting's observant glance missed nothing; seeing the change in her disciple's face, she asked with curiosity.

The woman slowly shook her head. "I do not know him."

Ran Yunting's brow knit; she seemed somewhat unconvinced.

The woman explained, "Master's abode has always been simple—nothing but bed and chair. Today to suddenly see a man's portrait I was surprised."

Hearing this, Ran Yunting did not read too deeply into it and nodded. "Oh. I myself have never seen the person in this painting. However, recently the Fire Radiance Sect has been searching for him, and the Valley Lord has ordered disciples to go looking as well. He may be the key to resolving Ice Heart Valley's crisis!"

"Is that so…" The woman exerted tight control over her emotions and nodded faintly.

Ran Yunting watched her disciple closely but found nothing suspicious in her expression. Believing most of her explanation, she smiled faintly and said, “Such matters can be left to others. Your foremost task now is to cultivate diligently and reach your master’s realm as soon as possible—no, to surpass it. When that day comes, Ice Heart Valley will be yours. Don’t let me down.”

"Your disciple will spare no effort!" the woman intoned.

"That is good. Now, tell me the problems you've encountered in your recent training." Ran Yunting said warmly as she gestured.

The woman immediately spoke, asking several questions that had troubled her in cultivation. Ran Yunting listened and explained carefully; the two of them exchanged questions and answers, and time passed.

Before long it was dawn; the woman rose and took her leave.

After she exited the ice chamber, her steps were unhurried as she walked outward. In a short while she had left the inner island and come to the outer island.

Icebound Island was divided into an inner and outer section. The inner island was heavily guarded—ordinary disciples could not enter without a summons. Only the personal disciples of the Elders and the core members of Ice Heart Valley were permitted within.

The outer island was where ordinary disciples lived and cultivated.

The outer island occupied a vast area. The woman headed straight for an ice peak in the southeast.

Beneath that ice peak was an artificially hewn ice cave. There were hundreds of such rooms in a single ice peak, and there were hundreds of such peaks across the outer island.

These ice dwellings naturally served as living and cultivation quarters for disciples. Their grade depended on cultivation level and contributions to Ice Heart Valley, so disciples occupied dwellings of varying rank.

The young woman came to a crystal palace at the foot of the mountain, raised her hand, and sent a strand of Saint Yuan into the barrier before her, then stood quietly waiting.

After a long while there was no response.

She frowned, took out a token from her Spatial Ring and pressed it to the barrier. The next moment the barrier parted of its own accord, revealing a passage.

She slipped through the opening and moved with quick steps.

Very soon she had reached the innermost chamber. Looking around, there were no other signs of life inside; only a letter lay on a desk, bearing the inscription “To Su Yan, personally.”

Her hand trembled as she picked up the letter, broke the wax seal and drew out a sheet of paper, then read it carefully.

"Su Yan, by order of the Elders' Council I have gone out with many fellow disciples on a mission. The order came too hastily for me to bid you farewell. If you come seeking me, you will find this letter. This mission is to locate a person—and that person is Yang Kai! He has come to Chi Lan Star. For reasons unknown, the Fire Radiance Sect is searching for him, and Ice Heart Valley is searching as well! Remember, do not act rashly—wait until I return!"

It was signed: Qing Ya.

Qing Ya—once a top expert on the Tongxuan Continent, the Ice Lord Qing Ya!

Su Yan read the brief letter from beginning to end several times. Her delicate frame trembled as she made sure she had not misread it.

Yang Kai had truly come!

Having seen Yang Kai's portrait in her master's ice chamber, Su Yan could hardly believe it. For certain reasons she did not wish to ask Ran Yunting about it directly, so early this morning she hurried to find Qing Ya to see if she had heard any news.

Back when Qing Ya and she had first come to Ice Heart Valley together, Qing Ya cultivated an ice-based art as well. Her cultivation remained low only because the Tongxuan Continent's Spiritual Qi was insufficient, so when Ran Yunting brought Su Yan to Ice Heart Valley she had brought Qing Ya along as well.

Although Qing Ya's aptitude was not bad, she could not compare to Su Yan, and so she could only live on the outer island as an ordinary disciple. She was now at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm and was close to breaking through to the Third.

Su Yan often took time to visit Qing Ya. Having both come from the Tongxuan Continent, the two were naturally close.

Yet this time Su Yan had come too late.

After the Elders' Council convened yesterday they immediately decided to dispatch disciples to search for Yang Kai. Upon receiving the order, Qing Ya left with countless fellow disciples the same day.

She could not enter the inner island to hand the message to Su Yan, but knowing Su Yan would surely come to see her, she left a letter before departing to inform her of Yang Kai's news.

Holding the letter in her hand, Su Yan's emotions surged and her eyes grew slightly damp.

Had Ran Yunting seen her in that moment, she would have been greatly surprised.

She had always believed her disciple’s heart to be as firm as ice, untouched by worldly emotions—never would she have thought that a single letter could shake her so deeply.

Decades of agonized thought were released in a single dawn, enough to swallow Su Yan whole.

Qi and blood rolled within her. Su Yan gave a soft cry; her face went deathly pale and blood leaked from the corner of her mouth. Her Saint Yuan surged and faltered, becoming unstable.

Su Yan's complexion changed. Not daring to neglect it, she quickly sat cross-legged and circulated her cultivation to resolve the turmoil.

After a long while her chaotic breath gradually calmed. She rose, carefully stowed the letter, and left Qing Ya's ice dwelling in haste.

On Chi Lan Star the disciples of the two supreme powers were frequently dispatched, and a single thread pulled could set the whole network in motion. In a very short time nearly the entire Chi Lan Star was stirred.

The sects and noble families aligned with the two top powers were notified to cooperate with the Fire Radiance Sect or Ice Heart Valley and put their full effort into seeking Yang Kai's whereabouts.

Chi Lan Star was turned upside down!

Yang Kai seemed to have vanished as if into thin air; no one could find a trace of him.

……

In the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai secluded himself and cultivated.

He was in no hurry to appear. Having only just escaped Luo Hai, Yang Kai would not recklessly show himself again.

Who knew whether Luo Hai was still searching for him? If he ventured out and walked into a trap, he would have to expend effort fleeing once more.

It was the perfect time to consolidate the gains of recent days.

Invisible fluctuations of power spread through the pavilion where Xia Ningshang sat—the mysterious and profound Spatial Force.

The Small Xuan Realm had originally been developed to a radius of one hundred li, home to tens of thousands of humans, yao and demons. While not cramped, the area for activity was not great.

But today, with the wave of that Spatial Force, the Small Xuan Realm's area was expanding outward at a startling speed, and scenery and land previously unseen were revealed to the beings living there.

Two hundred li, five hundred li, one thousand li…

Two thousand li…

Three thousand li…

Very soon the experts of the human, yao and demon races who had been in seclusion seemed to sense it. They emerged, released their Divine Sense and probed the surroundings, instantly discovering the anomaly in the Small Xuan Realm.

"Brother Ling, this little world is actually expanding—am I mistaken?" Meng Wuya stood in the void and drew the strange distant sight into view, his expression shocked.

"You are not mistaken," Ling Taixu replied, slowly shaking his head. "It truly is expanding."

A booming laugh sounded as Great Yao Lord Lei Long flashed to Meng Wuya's side. "Excellent! No more squeezing in with Changyuan's lot—I've had my fill of their demonic qi!"

"Lei Long, I heard that," came a cold snort as the Demon Lord Changyuan made a leisurely appearance.

"Heard and so what? I, Lei Long, never bad-mouth anyone behind their back—if I have something to say, I’ll say it right to your face.”

Changyuan grunted, "Do you think I want to be shoved in with you? Your yao qi is nothing special either."

Lei Long chuckled, utterly unconcerned.

Although the three races now all lived within the Small Xuan Realm with no major conflicts, the competition between them remained fierce. Yang Kai had given them the chance to strive, and now each of them redoubled their efforts to advance along the Martial Dao and seek greater power.

Thus, when they occasionally met they would trade barbs, but they took pleasure in it all the same.
