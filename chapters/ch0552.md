## Chapter 552 — Spring Breeze and Fine Rain, Silently Intruding

The Divine Roaming Realm masters of the Seven Great Families’ allied forces held their breath, silently watching the battle unfolding in the sky.

Two other cultivators beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, yet to step onto the stage, also paid close attention.

“Brother Huo, what exactly is Meng Wuya’s level of strength?” The square-faced elder softly inquired of the Fat Elder of the Huo Family. Though he had observed the entire previous battle, his impression was nowhere near as profound as that of the Fat Elder who had personally tested Meng Wuya.

The Fat Elder of the Huo Family sighed softly, forced a bitter smile, and said, “Please forgive my choice of words, but ‘unfathomable’ is the best way to describe him.”

The square-faced elder was startled, staring at the Fat Elder in shock.

The Fat Elder shook his head. “I do not intend to belittle others to aggrandize myself. I have lived many years and have studied the realm beyond Divine Roaming extensively, cultivating unique insights into martial Dao and the heavenly Dao. Yet, I have never met anyone like him… Put simply, in a one-on-one fight, even if we use a war of attrition with multiple people taking turns, he alone could defeat all eight of us.”

“What?” The square-faced elder’s face darkened sharply.

Although they all knew Meng Wuya was a difficult adversary, this judgment was exceedingly high—but since it came directly from the Fat Elder, it was unquestionably true.

Having been together for so many years, they knew each other's characters well. The Fat Elder of the Huo Family would never exaggerate.

“That Demonic Master is extraordinary as well…” The man whom Di Mo had earlier defeated slowly opened his eyes and spoke in a deep voice, “Even if not on the same level as Meng Wuya, he is not someone we can handle.”

The Fat Elder’s gaze grew somewhat puzzled as he murmured, “Moreover, I feel that these two are... seemingly not on the same level as us.”

“What do you mean? How could they not be on the same level, they are also beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, are they not?”

“I can’t quite explain it,” the Fat Elder frowned deeply. Comparing himself to Meng Wuya, he always felt that this man stood above the clouds, looking down on him—an unreachable height.

“In that case, Ling Taixu is comparatively normal,” Yang Liting interjected. “Though Ling Taixu’s realm is similar to ours, his profound skills and moves show traces of Meng Wuya’s style, perhaps from the many years discussing martial Dao together in Lingxiao Pavilion, drawing precious experience from Meng Wuya. Judging by his performance, he will likely exhaust himself after winning just two matches.”

“Two matches won?” The square-faced elder’s complexion grew even graver. “Does that mean we’re doomed to lose them all?”

Three adversaries versus their eight people; even if Ling Taixu only fought twice, Meng Wuya and Di Mo’s methods would allow them to eliminate everyone else.

Hoping to win even a single match was but a futile fantasy for experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm—it was truly laughable.

All five looked pale and despondent, helpless against the situation.

These people once stood guard over Fengshen Hall as Grand Elders of the Eight Great Families; themselves masters beyond the Divine Roaming Realm revered by the world. They believed that even if someone was stronger than them, they could not be overwhelmingly so. Only today did they realize their impotence.

“A frog in a well, viewing the sky as a bottomless well…” Yang Liting’s deep eyes softly spoke, the words piercing everyone’s hearts.

“Brother Ye, no matter if you face Meng Wuya or that Demonic Master later, be extremely cautious. Meng Wuya at least shows some restraint, but the Demonic Master’s methods are ruthless,” the man injured by Di Mo warned gravely. “Also, Brother Liu, do not let his demonic aura harm you... it’s difficult to dispel.”

As he spoke, his face paled again, hastily circulating profound energy—apparently not fully recovered.

The two top experts from the Ye and Liu Families who were warned nodded slightly. The square-faced elder of the Ye Family grew even more serious, suddenly turning his gaze coldly toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai himself was currently watching the fierce battle in the sky, absorbing the various transcendent states emanating from above, utterly entranced.

Suddenly, a sense of incongruity surged from deep within his heart.

Yang Kai became alert at once, instantly raising his vigilance. He felt a faint chill brush past him, but upon careful inspection, found nothing abnormal.

Frowning, he glanced toward the top experts of the Eight Great Families, just then locking eyes with the square-faced elder from the Ye Family.

The elder’s expression was blank as he slowly averted his gaze.

“Young master...” Tang Yuxian noticed Yang Kai’s changed expression and hurriedly asked in a low voice, “Is something wrong?”

“Nothing,” Yang Kai shook his head. “Probably just a false alarm.”

“Oh.” Tang Yuxian saw no real problem and ceased questioning.

Yang Kai gave the square-faced elder a brief but piercing glance, his brow furrowed deeply. Although he sensed nothing wrong with himself, that earlier feeling of discord was not an illusion.

Beasts have instincts; so do warriors. In some respects, a warrior’s intuition is even sharper and more accurate.

The square-faced elder either meant harm or had already taken action against him, which was why Yang Kai had sensed it.

Seeing the unfavorable situation, he was searching for a breakthrough from Yang Kai’s side? Yang Kai’s face darkened, silently mocking.

He dared not lower his guard even a little. If a master beyond Divine Roaming made a move against him, it would be normal for him not to detect it.

Drawing a slow breath, Yang Kai closed his eyes and unleashed his powerful Divine Sense to scan himself thoroughly; he discovered nothing unusual.

His Divine Sense then entered into his Sea of Consciousness, where his spirit floated above a vast ocean, gazing around.

Within the Sea of Consciousness was serene tranquility: various fish swimming in the waters, birds flying in the sky—all embodiments of Yang Kai’s memories and experiences, shaped by his Divine Sense energy.

At the center floated a dazzling, multicolored island that stood like a treasure mountain.

Above this treasure island hovered a small sword and a flat, round object of unknown purpose.

The multicolored island was the Warm Spirit Lotus incarnate; the small sword was Yang Kai’s Divine Soul Secret Treasure, and the flat, round object was a treasure taken from the Black Book’s seventh page.

Yet, until now, Yang Kai did not know what power it possessed. Since obtaining it, it had resided peacefully in his Sea of Consciousness, neither enhancing his strength nor harming him in any way.

Gentle rain fell softly, transforming the scenes inside the Sea of Consciousness into an ethereal fairyland, breathtakingly beautiful and enchanting.

Had he been overthinking? Had the other party not actually made a move?

After all, Di Mo had previously expressed concern about this and had explicitly stated it was impossible for them to strike when Di Mo, Ling Taixu, and Meng Wuya were not present against Yang Kai.

Those people were all revered elders of the Eight Great Families. Their words naturally carried weight.

Yang Kai smiled lightly and prepared to withdraw from his Sea of Consciousness.

Just then, his movement abruptly froze, his eyes icy cold as he fixed his gaze upon his Sea of Consciousness. After a moment, he chuckled, “Interesting. I don’t recall ever having rain inside my Sea of Consciousness.”

Everything inside the Sea of Consciousness shifts with a cultivator’s mood; happiness brings clear skies, sadness brings rain and storms.

Yang Kai had thought the persistent drizzle was due to his fluctuating emotions, but upon reflection, found that the rain was not at all connected to him.

If it was unrelated to himself, then it must have been caused by someone else.

“Show yourself!” Yang Kai’s angry roar shattered the calm as the Sea of Consciousness suddenly erupted with waves dozens of zhang high, surging skyward like the ocean’s Jiao, majestic and unstoppable.

The fine rain abruptly paused as the Divine Sense’s overwhelming pressure forced it to cease.

Suddenly, a semi-transparent figure appeared not far from Yang Kai, face solemn as he looked intently at Yang Kai.

“So it was you!” Yang Kai sneered, contemptuous. “What, even a master beyond Divine Roaming speaks nonsense when it suits him?”

The man was none other than the square-faced elder’s spirit from the Ye Family.

Since his appearance that night, he had harbored strong grievances against Yang Kai and those in his home, leaving Yang Kai quite puzzled as to what he had done to offend him. After pondering, the best explanation was that he was siding with Ye Xinrou.

After all, he was an ancestor of the Ye Family.

Surprise briefly flickered across the elder’s face, clearly not expecting Yang Kai to see through his method, then he nodded, “You are indeed formidable. You pierced through an old man’s soul technique at the Divine Roaming Realm’s Second Stage. This Elder’s ‘Spring Breeze and Fine Rain’ has never failed.”

“Spring Breeze and Fine Rain, Silently Intruding” was the old man’s signature soul technique.

For a master beyond Divine Roaming to use this move against Yang Kai felt like overkill, yet it failed to take effect and was swiftly seen through, much to his surprise.

Yang Kai snorted, coldly staring at him, saying nothing.

“Young man of the Yang Family, how have you cultivated your Sea of Consciousness?” The elder asked in a low voice. “At your cultivation level, it is impossible to possess such vast and pure Divine Sense power. While your strength is far inferior to mine, it still far exceeds the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm.”

“You old dog, you snuck into my Sea of Consciousness not to ask that question, right?” Yang Kai mocked him, not waiting for a reply. “Feeling humiliated by this, so you want to save face by prying secrets from me?”

The elder paid no mind to the ridicule, calmly responding, “I am merely curious how you achieved it. If you are unwilling to say, I will refrain from asking. I will have my chance to find out eventually. As for why I sneaked in, naturally it is to uncover some of your secrets.”

“My secrets?” Yang Kai paused, then grinned. “Methods for rapidly increasing a warrior’s strength?”

The elder nodded, “Exactly. Your Yang Family does not care about you, hoping you will give up and go to Zhongdu to seek their protection. The Seven Great Families are using your family’s stance to try their luck, seeing if they can obtain that method before your family does. Even if they cannot, the Seven Great Families have jointly put on a show with the Yang Family tonight; they might still gain some benefits.”
