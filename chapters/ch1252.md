## Chapter 1252 — What Will You Pay?

The moment Yang Kai raised his shield, countless blood blades slammed into it, each strike like a crescent moon blade cutting across the surface with earth-shattering clamor, the successive impacts forcing Yang Kai's figure to stagger backward.

An Zhiyong's expression, however, showed no joy at all; it grew markedly solemn, for that purple shield looked dim yet still managed to stop his blood blades — clearly an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure of no small caliber — and he redoubled his efforts swinging the short axe.

As he swung, a seemingly binding force wafted from the short axe, tugging at the blood blades deflected by the Purple Shield; they spun and whirled, then once more surged from all sides toward Yang Kai.

"Yuan control?" Yang Kai frowned, but he quickly dismissed the notion: An Zhiyong plainly didn't understand any Yuan Control Art — the way the blood blades could be steered must be the Secret Treasure's power.

Realizing that, Yang Kai let out a soft sigh.

He had been defending the whole time to see what shocking trick this Demon Blood Sect disciple possessed; after all, he would still be living on Dark Star in the future, and sparring with these local forces would prepare him for meeting them again.

It turned out that although An Zhiyong cultivated at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, his Saint Yuan was mixed and impure; his methods were odd, but ultimately they posed no real threat to him.

He abandoned further probing, withdrew the Purple Shield, and exposed himself beneath the rain of blood blades.

An Zhiyong beamed at this sight. Though he didn't understand why Yang Kai had given up his defense, he knew opportunity must not be missed. He savagely swung the short axe, directing the countless blood blades to swirl around Yang Kai's sides, determined to grievously wound him.

Yang Kai stared coldly. The instant the blades pressed in, a pitch-black Demonic Flame welled up from his body; the flame burned unbearably hot and, the moment it appeared, caused the temperature for dozens of zhang around to spike abruptly.

As soon as the blood blades touched the Demonic Flame, they melted away, unable to cut even an inch into that infernal blaze.

An Zhiyong's face changed in alarm, and before he could use a follow-up move, Yang Kai's figure struck like thunder, closing on him in an instant; the black Demonic Flame flared and swallowed An Zhiyong completely.

The clash and screams erupted; An Zhiyong's cries were riddled with panic and terror.

The opponent's jet-black flames seemed to counter his sinister Saint Yuan. Enveloped by that overwhelming aura, his full strength could not be brought to bear; if not for one or two defensive Secret Treasures protecting him, he'd likely have died at first contact.

This was supposed to be the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm? An Zhiyong’s mind went blank—could this man actually be an Origin Returning Realm master in disguise?

While Yang Kai and An Zhiyong battled, over there Ye Yangrong and Deng Ning were also locked in a life-or-death fight. Deng Ning, wrapped in a cloud of blood, had exhausted his tricks and could only barely fend for himself; he could at most stall for half an incense stick. After that time passed, he felt his doom was inevitable — his Junior Brother's Demon Blood Transformation had been cultivated to an exceedingly high level, far beyond his ability to resist.

Just as dread gripped him, Ye Yangrong suddenly withdrew some of the blood cloud's force, easing the pressure and giving Deng Ning a chance; heartened, he unleashed every method he had and managed to stem the tide somewhat.

Ye Yangrong's voice carried through the blood cloud: "Junior Brother An, what are you doing? Kill that man and come help!"

Though Ye Yangrong heard An Zhiyong shouting, he assumed his comrade was feigning to delay the enemy so the two of them could fight Deng Ning to mutual ruin; he had no idea An Zhiyong already had no time even to answer — his face drained of color, he was being pressed hard by Yang Kai.

Because Ye Yangrong was suspicious, he hadn't used his full strength against Deng Ning, intending to save some force to contest Deng Ning's spoils with An Zhiyong.

For a time, both battlefields carried a strange air: one side scheming and withholding full effort; the other suffering in silence, sweat pouring down.

But the scene soon clarified.

Less than half a cup of tea after An Zhiyong and Yang Kai engaged, a wretched cry split the air. An Zhiyong flew back as if mortally wounded, vomiting a plume of blood mid-air; his face ashen, his eyes overflowing with horror.

At the instant he was hurled back, Yang Kai's figure followed close behind; before An Zhiyong hit the ground, a fist smashed into his chest.

An Zhiyong only had time for one heart-rending scream before his chest caved in; his pupils dimmed, and his body burst apart in midair.

Hearing the cry, Ye Yangrong's heart leapt. He looked over and saw the grisly eruption of An Zhiyong's body and cried out in shock: "Impossible!"

The momentary shock made his blood cloud tremble. Seizing the chance, Deng Ning broke free, standing there in a sorry state, panting and glancing at the blood cloud with wary uncertainty, then at Yang Kai who was retracting his punch; his eyes showed an impossible mix of astonishment, joy, and dread.

With An Zhiyong dead and Deng Ning escaped, Ye Yangrong realized something was wrong. The blood cloud writhed and his form reappeared; he frowned and regarded Yang Kai in silence.

"Make one move and I'll kill you!" Yang Kai flicked the blood from his hand, lifted his head and cast Ye Yangrong a cold glance — the sort of look a butcher gives lambs in a pen. Ye Yangrong suddenly felt cold all over, as if plunged into an ice cellar.

Though it was only a threat, Ye Yangrong inexplicably believed Yang Kai had the power to carry it out; in fear, he didn't dare move.

He opened his mouth but was cut off by Deng Ning, who strode forward and cupped his fist to Yang Kai with a forced smile: "Friend, thanks for saving me."

His expression was sincere; even a disciple of the Moxue Sect, having been saved from death, would feel gratitude.

“This has nothing to do with you!” Yang Kai replied coldly. He didn’t have much goodwill toward this Deng Ning either — after all, when the man was being chased by his two Senior Brothers, he had deliberately flown in Yang Kai’s direction, clearly intending to drag him into the mess.

Moreover, Ye Yangrong and An Zhiyong had suspected Yang Kai was Deng Ning's planted assistant. Yang Kai had no intention to deny it — put any other Second Stage of the Saint King Realm through what he had and they wouldn't be alive to argue; they'd be dead as a result of muddled planning.

Still, if Yang Kai put himself in Deng Ning's shoes, he might have acted the same to survive. Though he disliked Deng Ning's tactics, he wasn't intent on pressing the matter; the man had acted purely to save his life and couldn't be faulted for that in the moment.

Choked off by Yang Kai’s retort, Deng Ning looked sheepish but sensible, dropping the matter; his face turned solemn as he said, “Friend, won’t you do one last good deed for Deng and help me kill this heartless, treacherous bastard? I will reward you handsomely afterward!”

Hearing this, Ye Yangrong's face drained; only now did he realize the youth of Second Stage of the Saint King Realm really wasn't Deng Ning's man. Instantly regret flooded him.

Had he known things would turn out this way, he never would’ve brought trouble upon himself by letting An Zhiyong deal with Yang Kai. He would’ve sent the man away as soon as possible instead. But regret was useless now—An Zhiyong was already dead, and Yang Kai was looking at him with clear displeasure, obviously annoyed at being dragged into this pointless conflict. Judging from the strength he’d just shown, killing An Zhiyong in less than half a cup of tea’s time, if he really joined forces with Deng Ning, how could he possibly survive?
    
Ye Yangrong's heart pounded. He looked anxiously at Yang Kai, worrying what reply he might receive.

To his surprise, Yang Kai merely lifted his eyelids, glanced at Deng Ning, and shook his head. “The grudges between you and your Senior Brothers don’t interest me.”

Ye Yangrong relaxed, thinking he might escape unscathed — but Deng Ning interjected: "Friend, we're disciples of the Demon Blood Sect. You killed my Senior Brother An; if you let Ye Yangrong go, this affair will be exposed and you will get into trouble."

"You want me to kill you all to silence you?" Yang Kai grinned, his gaze sliding over Deng Ning and Ye Yangrong with ill intent, making both men's hearts race and their nerves fray.

Ye Yangrong, meanwhile, privately cursed Deng Ning and loathed his loose tongue. Deng Ning's remark, however, gave him hope. He leaned in: "Junior Brother Deng, this fellow doesn't seem reasonable — let's set aside our quarrels and team up against him."

Deng Ning snorted and refused without hesitation: "Sorry, I have no interest in joining forces with someone like you."

“Calling it an attempt to silence witnesses wouldn’t be wrong, but if you intend to kill me too then I have nothing to say — after all, if you hadn’t intervened I’d have been doomed anyway. But even if I die, I won’t let this man off easy!”

He looked at Ye Yangrong with a feral grin, as if driven mad when he was forced to abandon the Blood Fusion Pill. Deng Ning had become utterly unhinged.

"You're insane!" Ye Yangrong cried, recoiling.

Before he could take another step, a Divine Sense pressure from above struck him with deadly force. At the same time, his Sea of Consciousness defenses were shattered and a soul attack slipped through, veiled and dormant.

Ye Yangrong broke out in cold sweat. If he moved now, his Sea of Consciousness would be assaulted for sure. This Divine Sense was as strong as that of a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; it was beyond his ability to resist.

He dared not make any sudden moves and stared at Yang Kai in abject fear; he couldn't fathom that such a Divine Sense attack could have come from a man like this.

After tearing through that man's Sea of Consciousness defenses to warn him, Yang Kai didn't hurry to finish him off. Instead, he looked Deng Ning over with interest and suddenly asked, "I could help — but what can you offer me as payment?"
