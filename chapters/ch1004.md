## Chapter 1004 — Wusuo's Encounter

Having absorbed those soul energies, Yang Kai's understanding of the Saint Realm reached an astonishing depth, and his control over his own strength became far more practiced than before.

The benefits extended beyond that: every time he devoured another's soul energy it more or less increased the intensity of Yang Kai's Divine Sense, strengthening his Divine Sense power. Each increase was slight, but accumulated like sand into a tower, making his soul several times stronger than warriors of the same rank.

The ocean of flames formed by that Divine Sense seemed to grow richer and more surging as a result.

Yang Kai swallowed the last few clusters of soul energy.

However, while devouring one of the soul clusters his expression suddenly turned odd. He hurriedly stopped and stared in surprise.

Floating before his Spirit Body was a cluster of soul energy that was not particularly powerful; compared with the others it was weaker, only at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

This was what that Chartmaster Wusuo left behind after his death!

Yang Kai understood immediately, because he had seen with his own eyes Wusuo explode into a spray of blood before him with no bones left; at that time, in the warship's engine room, Wusuo had been the only person at Transcendent Realm, the rest were all at the Saint Realm.

The soul energy Wusuo left behind seemed somewhat different from the others.

Indeed, it was only at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, weaker than the rest, but it hid something else—something unusual.

Yang Kai condensed a divine thought and probed toward it.

Suddenly he seemed to leave his Sea of Consciousness. He found himself standing within a vast Starry Sky, the heavens strewn with countless stars. Those stars emitted captivating, dazzling light—some brimming with vitality, some dead and dull.

In that instant he felt himself become boundless, standing within the Starry Sky and overlooking the entire Star Domain.

No corner, no star, could escape his gaze.

Those points of starlight were, under some strange force, rotating according to an extraordinarily complex pattern that he could not trace.

With one glance Yang Kai saw a region at the very center of this Star Domain.

Some stars there shone especially brightly—some crimson like burning fireballs, some white as if covered in frost. On certain stars, wind energy had condensed into material, forming towering wind dragons that stretched toward the heavens. Other stars resembled ancient trees...

Chaos Abyss!

Yang Kai was shaken to his core.

He immediately realized that the extraordinary Starry Sky he was seeing was the Chaos Abyss in which he had once been lost and could not find a way out. He was far too familiar with those radiant, energy‑rich stars.

The first place he had entered upon arriving in the Starry Void had been the Chaos Abyss; he had long since memorized the appearances of those stars, engraved them into his very soul—they were identical to what he now saw.

Only reduced in scale countless times.

Hidden within Wusuo's soul energy was, astonishingly, a Star Chart.

Moreover, it was a Star Chart of the entire Hengluo Star Domain!

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, unable to understand why things had turned out this way.

While his Divine Sense lingered, secretly examining the Star Chart, the waters of his Sea of Consciousness seemed to evaporate; the water level dropped rapidly and his Divine Sense power drained at an incredible rate.

A tearing pain spread from his Sea of Consciousness throughout his body. Startled, Yang Kai hastily withdrew his divine thought and then noticed the changes in his Sea of Consciousness.

In that short span nearly half of the Divine Sense power in his Sea of Consciousness had been consumed.

That tearing pain was a symptom of Divine Sense power being overexerted, and it seemed related to his earlier heedless probing of the Star Chart's mysteries!

Yang Kai drew a deep breath, not daring to act rashly again, and quickly retreated his consciousness.

When his awareness returned to his body a cold wind blew; his clothes were soaked with sweat, every muscle taut, his body trembling.

Shen Tu sat beside him, staring in astonishment.

Seeing him look as if facing a great foe and in dreadful pain, Shen Tu could not help but advise, "Yang Kai, take it slow, don't rush. After all, that is a restriction set by a Saint King Realm expert; you won't be able to break it in a short time."

He clearly believed Yang Kai had been attacking the restriction left by Lü Guichen and had therefore ended up in such a sorry state.

"I know, don't worry about me," Yang Kai answered casually, secretly taking a Saint Pill from the Demon God's Secret Codex and popping it into his mouth, breathing slowly to restore his Divine Sense power while he thought.

According to Shen Tu, Wusuo was one of the top three premier chart masters within the Purple Star force, which qualified him to be stationed aboard Purple Star's warship to guide its course and to repair and alter Star Charts.

A Chartmaster of that caliber must have had unique insights into the Star Domain; apart from spending a little time on cultivation, the rest of his life was surely devoted to studying Star Charts.

But that still could not explain why, after the purifying power of the Soul‑Extinguishing Golden Light, the Star Chart could remain.

The Soul‑Extinguishing Golden Light can erase a warrior's memories and entire life experiences, leaving behind only refined energy.

That is also why Yang Kai had always only been able to obtain others' insights into the Dao of martial arts, and not their cultivation manuals or secret codices.

Knowledge contained in a Star Chart could be regarded as Wusuo's lifelong field of study, and in principle it should have been purified away.

Yet it remained intact.

This phenomenon was strange; it had never happened before.

Yang Kai pondered, then suddenly thought of a possibility.

This preserved Star Chart was not knowledge Wusuo had researched and acquired himself; rather, he must once have had a strange encounter and in some place merged with this Star Chart.

It did not belong to Wusuo, so it had not been purified. It was of a grade higher than the World‑Ending Demon Eye!

Only such a possibility could explain the present situation.

The more Yang Kai reflected, the more convinced he became that his conjecture was correct.

He suddenly opened his eyes, looked at Shen Tu, and said, "Let me ask you something."

"What?" Shen Tu turned his head to look at him.

"How much do you know about that Chartmaster called Wusuo?"

"Why ask about him all of a sudden?" Shen Tu's expression turned odd. "He seems to be dead—I didn't see him here. How, did you know him before?"

"No, just curious."

Shen Tu chuckled softly. “He’s not some beauty, so I never paid him much mind—but since Wusuo is a top-grade Chartmaster, I do know a bit about him. Supposedly, he came from a small force that later declined, and he himself had no remarkable talent for cultivation. His whole life was rather mediocre—he didn’t even reach the Transcendent Realm until he was nearly two hundred years old. Two hundred! To only reach the Transcendent Realm by then… truly pathetic.”

Shen Tu knew a fair bit and began to chatter nonstop.

Yang Kai didn’t interrupt him, merely listened quietly to those trivial, meaningless bits of information, his expression calm and indifferent.

"Right, his becoming a Chartmaster had some legendary colors. Before reaching the Transcendent Realm he was a minor figure, unknown, but after ascending to Transcendent he suddenly blossomed in the field of Star Charts. The charts he engraved were extremely accurate and could avoid many hidden dangers. He came from a continent of Purple Star; after his reputation rose he was recruited by Purple Star."

"He only became a Chartmaster after reaching Transcendent?" Yang Kai's expression shifted.

“Strange, isn’t it? People have tried to investigate, but there’s very little solid information. Most believe that Wusuo must’ve been secretly tutored by some exceptionally skilled Chartmaster. His slow cultivation progress in the past was likely because he spent too much time studying Star Charts—otherwise, he couldn’t have risen to the rank of top-grade Chartmaster so quickly. Chart Masters are incredibly rare, and nurturing one demands immense time and effort. Every major power in the Star Domain has its own training program for them, yet even so, those who become truly useful are one in ten thousand.” Shen Tu smiled as he explained. “A Chartmaster can easily draw a route between two nearby stars, sure—but once the distance grows, they’re useless. The Star Charts they produce simply can’t guarantee a safe or accurate passage.”

"I understand. You keep cultivating then." Yang Kai had obtained the intelligence he needed and did not intend to keep chatting; he quickly closed his eyes.

"Hey, you still haven't told me why you were looking into Wusuo. Do you want to become a Chartmaster?" Shen Tu muttered to himself and laughed, "I'd advise you to give up that idea. Without decades or centuries of immersion and research into starfield dynamics, you simply can't do it. Chart masters need to master far too many complex things."

Yang Kai ignored him. Feeling rather deflated, Shen Tu shut his mouth and quietly began circulating his cultivation technique.

Yang Kai's Spirit Body once more manifested within his Sea of Consciousness. After exchanging a few words with Shen Tu, he had essentially confirmed his previous guess.

Wusuo had indeed become a Chartmaster because of a strange encounter, and that encounter was the Star Chart hidden within his soul.

With such a Star Chart, anyone could become a Chartmaster!

The reason he only shone after ascending to the Transcendent Realm was likely because probing the Star Chart's mysteries required enormous Divine Sense power; below Transcendent one could not sense it.

Yang Kai knew this all too well!

Just now he had only probed for the length of an incense stick and half of his Divine Sense had been consumed; a warrior like Wusuo would at most last half a cup of tea before collapsing from exhaustion and dying.

He had little desire to become a Chartmaster himself, but he was very interested in the Star Domain's structure and the distribution of its stars.

Within the Star Domain there are countless hidden dangers, ones even Saint King Realm experts would avoid. Chart masters are those who can detect and even preemptively avoid such dangers.

If he could fuse such a Star Chart into himself, Yang Kai felt he would never again fear becoming lost in the Star Domain.

He had suffered greatly in the Chaos Abyss and had harbored resentment ever since; therefore he decided to refine this Star Chart. This encounter that belonged to Wusuo had fallen into his hands, and naturally he would not let it go.
