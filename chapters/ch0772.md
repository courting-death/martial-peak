## Chapter 772 — How about a little negotiation?

The last time he made a scene at the Ice Sect, Yang Kai had already tested the might of the Soul Devouring Worm; beneath the Saint Realm there was no way to withstand it!

The first wave of Yang Clan fighters who arrived were neither weak nor few, but none among them belonged to that echelon of experts.

A tide of Divine Sense slammed through them; though it did not wound their bodies, the Soul Devouring Worm had silently crept into their Seas of Consciousness, lying in ambush, waiting only for Yang Kai's single thought to launch an attack that would destroy their Seas of Consciousness within a few breaths.

As Yang Kai moved, the Divine Tree once more erupted in a ferocious assault; its threadlike energies darted to and fro with uncanny agility, each strand bearing an almost unbearable weight, carving one great trench after another into the earth.

The thunderous noise carried far; the Yang Clan cultivators suffered terribly and still could not close with Yang Kai, all being swept away by the Divine Tree's strikes—some, by misfortune, dying on the spot.

Having seized the advantage, Yang Kai's expression, however, grew grave.

Heavy oppressive auras suddenly spread nearby, and with that pressure drawing closer the Yang Clan leader and the senior figures Yang Kai had seen earlier at last arrived.

"Leader, the Divine Tree is acting strangely!" a cultivator who had barely escaped the Divine Tree's blows shouted.

The leader's face darkened as he stared at the Divine Tree; a cold, cutting light flashed through his eyes as he fixed Yang Kai with a look, his countenance nonetheless betraying astonishment.

The other experts turned sallow and cried out in alarm, "How is this possible?"

They were all Saint Realm experts; through their Divine Sense they detected that a consciousness now existed within the Divine Tree, and that consciousness resented their intrusion, repelling them with palpable hostility.

"Does the Divine Tree... have its own consciousness?" the leader asked, his deep eyes locked on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai chuckled, "You could say that."

"You did this?"

"I only gave it a little help; it's not really my achievement." Yang Kai shook his head.

"So it favors you and rejects my clan?" The leader was sharp; though he had never known the full background, seeing this scene he quickly pieced the matter together.

A newly born life awareness will always be affectionate only toward those it deems familiar.

"The Divine Tree belongs to my clan, you little thief!" the Yang Clan leader snarled with rage.

"I never intended to steal it; it approached me—what could I do?"

"You should've been killed back then!" the leader raged, his face full of regret; the others ground their teeth, glaring at Yang Kai with feral expressions.

"You didn't make a move then — now you don't have a chance!" Yang Kai lifted an eyebrow, a confident grin on his face.

"If you think that, you're gravely mistaken," the Yang Clan leader said with a sinister smile. "A mere First Stage of the Transcendent Realm dares be insolent before me—what presumption."

As he spoke, a refined Divine Sense power suddenly burst from his mind.

Yang Kai had no time to react; a sharp, piercing pain ripped through his Sea of Consciousness, his face contorted as if torn apart, his body trembling while great beads of sweat rolled down his brow.

The leader's true cultivation level was unknown, but Yang Kai felt even more pressure facing him than when confronting Saintess Nan.

His strength was at least the second Stage of the Saint Realm.

An attack of Divine Sense released by so potent an expert was not something Yang Kai could take lightly.

His Sea of Consciousness churned; Yang Kai felt dizzy and even nauseous.

The instant the leader unleashed the Divine Sense attack, several experts beside him charged forward, launching killing moves at Yang Kai.

A willowlike branch descended from the air and swept him up before those killing blows could land, dragging An Ling'er along with him.

An Ling'er cried out; by the time she gathered herself they had already landed on a trunk of the Divine Tree, the surrounding branches densely covering them and enclosing them tightly.

At the same time, the energies dangling from the Divine Tree's canopy transformed into thousands of assaults, striking at the Yang Clan's experts.

These men changed expression, clearly not expecting this turn; when they attempted to pursue Yang Kai they were hindered by the Divine Tree and, fearing their techniques would harm the clan's root, they restrained themselves—holding on briefly before withdrawing.

"Leader, the Divine Tree seems to be protecting him!" one expert said, his face extremely ugly.

"I see it." The leader's expression turned stormy and unusually complex.

The Divine Tree not only sheltered this little thief, it even struck at its own clan; those attacks rivaled the methods of a Saint Realm expert, and breaking through the Divine Tree's defenses was clearly no easy task.

A sense of shame and unwillingness inexplicably swelled in the Yang Clan leader, as if a treasure he'd guarded his whole life had been casually taken by a shameless fellow.

"That matters not—one strike from me should end him!" the leader snorted, drawing a deep breath.

With his cultivation, dealing with a young man like Yang Kai was as effortless as snapping a shell; he was sure Yang Kai could not withstand such a blow.

No sooner had he spoken than a low, tragic, hoarse laugh echoed from the Divine Tree's trunk.

The crowd's faces changed; when they looked up they saw Yang Kai through the tangle of branches, staring down with bloodshot eyes.

"Not dead?" the leader frowned, exclaiming, "Impossible!"

Even with high-grade Divine Soul secret treasures, such a young man should not withstand his Divine Sense assault; judging by the wave of his Divine Sense, Yang Kai's soul had indeed been wounded—yet he still lived on.

Thud...

Thud...

A rhythmic, muffled thudding suddenly echoed from within the Divine Tree. Everyone felt that something was wrong — the consciousness contained in the tree seemed to have lost its reason after Yang Kai’s injury, and a violent, frenzied aura began to spread outward. The strength of this newly born life far exceeded anything anyone had imagined.

Even Yang Kai, lost in the pain pounding his head, was briefly stunned—he realized he had underestimated the Divine Tree.

Centered at the roots, the earth split open as dense Yang-attribute energy surged outwards like a solid substance, burning everything it touched to ash.

Even the Yang Clan's experts had to circulate True Yuan to withstand the searing assault; each person's skin flushed red, veins bulging.

The Divine Tree's branches flailed wildly, and the energies hanging from its crown lashed out unpredictably, the air filling with sounds of explosions.

Crack—crack—

The enormous Divine Tree swung to the left, then to the right, the pace of its shaking growing faster and faster.

In barely a dozen breaths, to everyone's stunned gaze the tree that had been rooted there broke free of the soil; visible Yang-attribute energy formed pillars like legs to support its massive body as it began to walk across the ground.

Its roots were highly developed, each root like crystal and exuding a dazzling golden light.

Yang Kai clapped a hand to his brow and laughed uproariously, his laughter rolling like thunder.

So many events had caught him off guard; that the Divine Tree possessed such abilities was beyond his expectation.

As for the wound to his soul, he cared little—nurtured by the Warm Spirit Lotus, such injuries would heal in short order.

Unless an attack could shatter his Sea of Consciousness and annihilate his soul outright, he had no fear; the Yang Clan leader clearly did not possess that power.

Unlike his own arrogant delight, all the Yang Clan people went pale as the Divine Tree charged straight at them, its wanton assault sweeping across the ground, forcing everyone to hastily retreat.

After letting the Divine Tree vent its wrath, Yang Kai patted the trunk and soothed, "Alright, alright—teach them a lesson and that's enough."

Yang Kai saw that the Divine Tree's movements were clumsy; though potent, it was unrealistic to expect it to slay the Yang Clan's top experts—those men could simply keep their distance and be safe.

Moreover, because the Divine Tree was bound to the Yang Clan's root, their experts refrained from harming it and thus did not attack Yang Kai, as if fearful of injuring the tree.

Now sheltered by the Divine Tree, Yang Kai's first thought was to leave as quickly as possible.

This was a heaven-sent opportunity.

At Yang Kai's words the Divine Tree truly calmed somewhat, though energy whips still coiled in the air, warning any who dared approach.

"You little thief, crawl down and beg for mercy and I might spare you; if my clan captures you first, you won't get that chance," the Yang Clan leader shouted from below, his face twisted.

"I'm so scared!" Yang Kai stood on the trunk feigning fright, which only infuriated the crowd below.

"You think you can escape? Fool! Dare to provoke the Divine Tree against my clan and even if you flee to the ends of the world I will tear you limb from limb!"

"Say whatever — I'm just calling it hot air!" Yang Kai sneered, curling his lip.

An Ling'er, who had been overly tense and half in a daze, heard Yang Kai and couldn't help but giggle.

Yang Kai shot her a glance, feeling pleased, then shouted down, "Old dog, how about we make a deal?"

"You think you have the right to bargain with me?" the Yang Clan leader fixed him with a look that could devour a man, as if he longed to tear him to pieces and drink his blood.
