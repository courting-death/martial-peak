## Chapter 2562 — Come Catch Me

One day later, Yang Kai emerged from the cave. The wound on his shoulder had already healed, and he had changed into a new set of clothes to avoid attracting unnecessary trouble with the smell of blood.

Zhang Ruoxi, who was keeping watch at the entrance, quickly stood up when she heard movement. Seeing Yang Kai’s complexion rosy, she finally relaxed.

Although she knew Yang Kai’s injury wasn’t serious, she still couldn’t help but worry.

The two exchanged a glance. Yang Kai nodded, and Zhang Ruoxi said, “Sir, I’ve discovered something strange.”

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Zhang Ruoxi hurriedly explained her previous cultivation experience, then looked at Yang Kai, hoping he could offer some insight.

Yang Kai had no idea what the issue was, but he couldn’t show his ignorance in front of Zhang Ruoxi. He pretended to ponder for a moment and said, “Better safe than sorry. For now, don’t cultivate in this Ancient Land. If you need to restore your strength, use Source Crystals and Spiritual Pills as much as possible. If that’s not enough, enter the Small Xuan Realm.”

Zhang Ruoxi naturally obeyed without hesitation, but after a moment, she asked, “Then what about you, sir?”

Yang Kai smiled, “I’m fine. The Primordial Power here can’t do anything to me.”

Zhang Ruoxi was surprised, gazing at Yang Kai with admiration. Her beautiful eyes nearly sparkled. She thought that Sir really was incredible. It’s said that even a Great Emperor would be affected by the Primordial Power here, but it didn’t trouble him at all.

Yang Kai cleared his throat and said, “Let’s go…”

As soon as he finished speaking, his expression suddenly changed. He turned and shouted, “Who’s sneaking around?!”

Zhang Ruoxi was startled as well. She had been guarding here and hadn’t noticed any signs of life approaching. She didn’t expect Sir to react like this the moment he appeared. But Sir wouldn’t act without reason, so there really must be someone here.

She looked around, following Yang Kai’s gaze toward a large tree.

There was nothing unusual over there. It was eerily quiet. Even when she swept her Divine Sense over it, she found nothing amiss.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “Hiding your head and showing your tail. Do you want me to invite you out myself?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a rustling sound came from the crown of the tree. Then, a head poked out from the dense foliage. Bright eyes darted around, glancing at Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi. The person grinned, baring their teeth.

Zhang Ruoxi’s face darkened.

In a place like this, someone suddenly smiling at her felt far too abrupt.

“Hmm?” Yang Kai made a curious sound, scrutinizing the person’s face. Their hair was a tangled mess, as if it hadn’t been washed in countless years, twisted together like black snakes covering their head.

The person’s face was pitch-black, making it impossible to see their features. Only their eyes were exceptionally bright, and their teeth gleamed white.

A woman!

Even though her face was hidden, Yang Kai could tell at a glance that this was a woman!

What woman doesn’t care about her appearance? Yet this one looked utterly disheveled, even more so than the Mortal Great Emperor Yang Kai had seen in Fenglin City. He wondered what she had experienced in this Ancient Land.

Not only that, Yang Kai instinctively felt her mind was somewhat disturbed. She was hanging upside down from the tree trunk, her eyes bright but her gaze chaotic.

What caught Yang Kai’s attention even more was her concealment technique.

If she hadn’t made a noise in the tree just now, Yang Kai wouldn’t have noticed her hiding there.

Who was this person?

Sweeping her with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai sensed a faint energy fluctuation within her and was shocked—she was a Second Stage of the Emperor Realm expert!

While Yang Kai was still guessing, the woman suddenly giggled, “Come catch me!”

As she spoke, her body suddenly drifted down from the tree trunk like a wisp of willow fluff. Before she even touched the ground, her slender waist twisted, and in the blink of an eye she shot into the jungle, vanishing without a trace, leaving behind only a string of silvery, bell-like laughter. “Come catch me, come catch me!”

Catch your mother! Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, more convinced than ever that this woman’s mind was troubled.

Otherwise, how could a dignified Second Stage of the Emperor Realm expert act like this? Not only was she dressed in rags, but her words made no sense. Encountering such a crazy woman in the Ancient Land, Yang Kai didn’t know what to say and had no interest in playing hide-and-seek with her.

“Sir, her clothes…” Zhang Ruoxi seemed to have noticed something, covering her lips in shock as she stared at the direction the crazy woman disappeared.

“What about her clothes?” Yang Kai frowned.

When the crazy woman fell from the tree, Yang Kai had glanced at her. Like her appearance, her clothes were tattered. With every movement, they revealed glimpses of her body. He couldn’t tell what color they originally were; now they were gray, as if they hadn’t been washed in years.

“Don’t you find them familiar, sir?” Zhang Ruoxi replied with a question.

Yang Kai was stunned. Her reminder made him wonder.

“That’s the attire of an Ice Heart Valley disciple!” Zhang Ruoxi said urgently.

“Are you sure?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened.

Zhang Ruoxi said, “Last time in Binglun City in the Northern Territory, I saw many Ice Heart Valley disciples. Their clothes were the same as hers, though hers are tattered. But the ice flower emblem on her chest can’t be faked.”

“Why would an Ice Heart Valley disciple come here?” Yang Kai was shocked.

Ice Heart Valley was in the Northern Territory, but this was the Eastern Territory. The two regions are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers. Ordinary people couldn’t come here. But thinking about how the Ancient Land was coveted by experts from the entire Star Realm, it made sense.

He himself was a disciple from the Southern Territory and managed to come here. So it wasn’t strange for people from the Northern Territory to arrive. This place was a gathering spot for experts from all four territories, a chaotic land of dragons and snakes.

But one thing puzzled him. Ice Heart Valley, since its founding by Bing Yun, didn’t have many experts, and Emperor Realm cultivators were especially rare. How could a Second Stage of the Emperor Realm disciple end up here, and with her mind disturbed?

As he pondered, Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly lit up as he remembered something.

When Bing Yun returned to Ice Heart Valley from the Jixu Secret Realm years ago, the acting Valley Lord, her eldest disciple An Ruoyun, had reported something to her. After Bing Yun disappeared, her third disciple went out searching for her, but there had been no news. Eventually, even the third disciple disappeared, and it had been three thousand years without any word.

Yang Kai was present when An Ruoyun reported this. He had sighed, thinking the third disciple was likely doomed. The Star Realm was dangerous, and if the third disciple were still alive, it wouldn’t be possible to have no news for three thousand years.

But this was their family matter, so Yang Kai hadn’t paid much attention.

Now, with Zhang Ruoxi’s reminder, Yang Kai suddenly felt that the crazy woman might be Bing Yun’s third disciple. Her Second Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation matched, since An Ruoyun and Sun Yunxiu, Bing Yun’s first and second disciples, were also at this level. The third disciple shouldn’t be much different.

Realizing this possibility, Yang Kai quickly looked in the direction the crazy woman had disappeared, but she was nowhere to be seen. She had already run off somewhere.

It was easy to explain why the third disciple appeared here. She left Ice Heart Valley to search for Bing Yun. The Ancient Land was famous, so she wouldn’t miss it, hoping to find Bing Yun here.

As for why her mind was disturbed, Yang Kai didn’t know. But it was easy to imagine she had suffered greatly. Otherwise, how could a Second Stage of the Emperor Realm expert become so crazy and disregard her appearance?

Of course, this was just Yang Kai’s guess. Whether the crazy woman was Bing Yun’s third disciple still needed to be confirmed. Maybe she had killed the third disciple and stolen her clothes.

If he hadn’t seen it, it wouldn’t matter. But since he had, and it involved Ice Heart Valley and Bing Yun, Yang Kai couldn’t ignore it.

“Sir, Old Ban said that in the Ancient Land passage, there was an Emperor Realm expert lost for ten years, and it was a woman… Do you think it could be her?” Zhang Ruoxi suddenly asked.

Yang Kai hadn’t thought of that, but after considering it, it seemed possible. Maybe she became crazy because she was lost in the passage for too long.

Old Ban said the woman was First Stage of the Emperor Realm, but Old Ban was only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. He couldn’t know whether the third disciple was First or Second Stage, maybe he was just guessing.

“Let’s chase after her and see.” Yang Kai waved his hand, wrapping Zhang Ruoxi in Emperor Yuan as they sped toward where the crazy woman had disappeared.

But along the way, they found no trace. Yang Kai released his Divine Sense but couldn’t sense the woman’s presence, though he did find signs of many demonic beasts.

The crazy woman seemed to have vanished into thin air, just as she had appeared so suddenly.

“Where did she go!” Yang Kai was frustrated. If he had known the crazy woman could be the Ice Heart Valley’s third disciple, he would have stopped her earlier. Now it would be hard to find her again.

After searching fruitlessly for most of the day, Yang Kai had no choice but to stop. Wandering blindly through this Wild Ancient Land was unwise—he could easily provoke some powerful ancient beast if he wasn’t careful.

Unable to find her, Yang Kai decided to give up for now. He planned to go to the Northern Territory after finishing his business here and pass on information about the crazy woman to Bing Yun. Bing Yun would surely make arrangements.

Taking out a jade slip to check, Yang Kai found that after half a day of pursuit, he had gone much deeper into the Ancient Land. Ahead was a gathering place for demonic beasts, and it seemed there was even a Twelfth-Tier demonic beast.

Yang Kai had no intention of causing trouble. He was mainly here to find Xiaoxiao, so he wanted to avoid risks as much as possible.

He put away the jade slip and was about to take a detour when a rustling sound came from a nearby tree. A pitch-black face poked out from the leaves, grinning and showing a mouthful of white teeth. She waved at Yang Kai, “Come catch me! Hurry, come catch me.”

Yang Kai was so exasperated by this crazy woman that his nose nearly twisted out of shape! He’d been searching for her all this time, only to realize she’d been hiding nearby, toying with him for her own amusement.
