## Chapter 1707 — Refining the Huntian Pill

Upon learning that Yang Kai was not only a pill refiner but also possessed Divine Sense Fire and could refine without relying on Saint Yuan or terrestrial fire, Sha Hu became ecstatic.

This meant that as long as he cultivated a good relationship with Yang Kai, he would not have to worry about lacking Huntian Pills to take in the future, nor about his own strength failing to grow; after a hundred years of bitter waiting, he finally saw hope for revenge!

He handed over the Huntian Pill formula without reservation, letting Yang Kai study it himself.

"When you've finished studying the formula and begin refining the Huntian Pill, I will have a favor to ask!" Sha Hu said with a laugh, deliberately trying to draw closer to Yang Kai; the wrinkles on his face puckered into a bundle, making him look extremely amiable.

Yang Kai naturally did not refuse; after telling him to do as he pleased, he plunged into study of the Huntian Pill formula.

He already had some Huntian Pills on hand, which allowed him to infer the formula's rough composition from them; now, with a complete formula, the process became even simpler and easier.

Besides, his alchemical skill ranked among the top in the Star Domain; with his discernment and experience, he could not only thoroughly comprehend the Huntian Pill formula but also refine and improve it.

It was only natural—after all, the Huntian Pill had been independently researched by a pill refiner stranded on Ghost Isle, and those who ended up there were rarely high in rank; how much value could the formulas they produced really have?

It could only serve as some reference for Yang Kai.

In just five days, Yang Kai devised an improved formula for the Huntian Pill. Compared to the one Sha Hu had given him, it was unquestionably far more refined — several ingredients were replaced, and many conflicting medicinal properties had been eliminated.

With the formula complete, Yang Kai naturally set about refining the pill.

But he was still missing one ingredient.

The medicinal power of the Huntian Lotus was extremely overbearing. If taken directly, it might strengthen a cultivator’s physique for a short time, but without other ingredients to temper its effects, it could only be used briefly before becoming ineffective. Forcing continued use would not only be useless — it could even damage the cultivator’s body.

Yang Kai called for Sha Hu.

Sha Hu had spent the past few days guarding outside the hut, never leaving its side, meditating while scheming his little plans; upon hearing Yang Kai's summons, he practically couldn't wait and darted into the hut, looking at Yang Kai with eager eyes.

"Elder Sha, I'm still short on some fish mint…"

Sha Hu chuckled and waved his hand; a large heap of fish mint appeared in the hut, immediately making the air inside turbid.

This purple seaweed, only three cun in length, was not a specialty of Ghost Isle; it could be collected in almost any deep-sea domain and wasn't particularly valuable—forces like Sea Hall and Sea God Palace looked down on collecting it and let it grow in the sea.

But its medicinal properties could perfectly harmonize with the Huntian Lotus; by counteracting one another, it neutralized the Lotus's domineering traits, making the Huntian Pill easier for warriors to absorb.

Seeing the countless fish mint before him, Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, then looked meaningfully at Sha Hu and said, "Elder Sha, you had prepared in advance!"

Sha Hu rubbed his hands and said, "Yang Kai, help this old man refine some Huntian Pills; with Huntian Pills, I can increase my strength again, and then we'll have a chance to fight back to Ghost Isle and find a way out!"

Yang Kai smiled faintly. Though he knew Sha Hu was trying to entice him, he paid it no mind and said calmly, "Helping you refine them is no problem, but do you have any Huntian Lotuses?"

The thousand Huntian Lotuses in the island's lake had all been stored in Yang Kai's Spatial Ring, and he had no intention of taking them out to give to Sha Hu for pill refining.

"You underestimate this old man," Sha Hu said with a foxlike grin. With a flip of his palm he produced seventeen or eighteen Huntian Lotuses, all of them silver-grade.

Yang Kai was astonished.

Sha Hu chuckled softly. “How could this old man not understand that one shouldn’t put all his eggs in one basket? Over the past hundred years, I haven’t stayed on this little island the whole time — I would occasionally venture out to explore, and of course, I’ve gained some things. Not only these, I’ve also gathered plenty of auxiliary ingredients for refining the Huntian Pill. Take a look and see if there’s anything you might need.”

As he spoke, Sha Hu took out many other medicinal materials.

Yang Kai nodded and stopped refusing; he left the useful materials and let Sha Hu take back the useless ones, then pondered and said, "Helping you refine them is not a problem, but I cannot work for nothing…"

"Fifty-fifty!" Sha Hu cut him off before he finished and immediately declared the terms. "Tell me what auxiliary herbs you need and I'll go find them now! Of the Huntian Pills produced, I'll only take half!"

"Deal!" Yang Kai no longer quibbled and nodded readily; Sha Hu was so generous that to haggle would seem petty. After spending some time with the old man, Yang Kai found that aside from their initial unpleasantness, they got along quite harmoniously.

Seeing Yang Kai agree, Sha Hu smiled even more happily.

That same day he departed the small island to search the sea regions for all manner of auxiliary herbs. Although Yang Kai had some refining materials, it was not enough for mass production—having Sha Hu go find them was, of course, a precaution.

After Sha Hu left the island, Yang Kai waved his hand.

A crimson flame shot from his palm, twisting and shifting in midair; in the next moment a stunningly voluptuous, scantily-clad, cold-eyed beauty appeared before Yang Kai, her red hair flowing like fire.

She wore fiery red armor that barely covered her ample twin peaks and the sensitive area from her thighs up to her lower abdomen.

Her enticing collarbones, flat stomach, and delicate navel were exposed to the air; from mid-thigh down, her beautiful legs were a sheet of snow-white, and her exquisite jade-like feet stepped upon the ground, unstained by dust.

Amidst the roaring Blazing Flame, she possessed an unusual beauty.

Artifact Spirit Liu Yan!

She could no longer be called the Fire Bird; she had her own sentience, could assume human form, and had been granted the name Liu Yan by Yang Kai—she was a special living being.

"Master, what are your orders?" Liu Yan asked in a low voice as soon as she appeared.

"I will borrow your power to refine pills—cooperate with me," Yang Kai instructed calmly.

Liu Yan nodded and silently shifted; she transformed into the shape of an alchemy furnace identical to her secret treasure, but entirely composed of flame—superior even to that Void King-Grade furnace.

Yang Kai concentrated fully, holding his breath as he placed the prepared materials in one by one, his Divine Sense communicating with Liu Yan to control the heat.

The process of refining the Huntian Pill was not complicated; with Yang Kai's skill, he could naturally refine them with ease.

In no more than half a day, a medicinal fragrance spread from the hut; Yang Kai seized the moment, sent his Divine Sense into the furnace, and condensed the pills using methods recorded in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

Soon, three streams of firelight shot up from the alchemy furnace and rose like a mighty spiral.

Yang Kai gestured and drew the three lights toward him; they fell into a jade bottle he had prepared.

A gurgling sound rolled from the jade bottle; Yang Kai looked and revealed a satisfied smile.

The pill-condensing techniques recorded in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy were profound; when employed well they allowed multiple pills to be condensed at once, unlike before when one set of materials could only produce a single pill.

Over the years Yang Kai had often attempted to use this condensed method when refining pills—sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing—but he had gained some insights.

Condensing three pills at once now was a considerable breakthrough.

He took out one Huntian Pill, placed it in his mouth to taste, feeling the medicinal effects contained within; after a moment he nodded with satisfaction and returned to his alchemical labors.

Half a day later another batch of Huntian Pills was successfully refined, and this time Yang Kai condensed four Huntian Pills—an improvement over the first.

As time passed and his number of refinings increased, Yang Kai's technique grew more adept and the time needed to produce a batch of Huntian Pills shrank—from half a day to two hours, then to one hour—so rapidly it was astonishing.

And in the continual refining, his pill-condensing method was also being perfected.

It could be said that this rare alchemical experience had yielded another substantive breakthrough on his path of pill-making—a pleasant, unexpected boon.

From behind came a splashing sound; Yang Kai turned and found that the little dolphin had somehow come into the hut—it wagged its tail and swam through the air as if in sea water, unimpeded and graceful.

Yang Kai stared in surprise!

On Ghost Isle, Saint Yuan could not be used — even someone as powerful as him couldn’t fly through the air, relying only on the strength of his physical body to make long leaps. Yet the little dolphin clearly defied that rule; it could actually swim through the air. Though it didn’t soar very high, it was still a kind of flight in its own right.

The little creature had clearly been drawn by the pill fragrance; when it came up to Yang Kai, its nostrils twitched and it gazed longingly at the alchemy furnace.

Yang Kai saw what looked like crystalline drool trickling from the corner of its mouth, dropping to the ground with a crisp sound.

Yang Kai was instantly disgusted by it and lost all desire to investigate how it could swim through the air.

The little dolphin made an irresistibly pleading noise, repeatedly nudging Yang Kai with its head, heedless of whether it was obstructing his refining.

Yang Kai rubbed his temple and could only hand it a jade bottle filled with Huntian Pills.

The little dolphin took it excitedly, circled Yang Kai a few times while emitting joyful chirps, then carried the jade bottle away in its mouth.

Yang Kai continued refining pills.

Three days later Sha Hu returned to the island, bringing Yang Kai a large amount of auxiliary herbs, then quietly waited outside the hut.

Smelling the pill fragrance wafting from the hut, Sha Hu felt as if he had become hundreds of years younger.
