## Chapter 81 — You Must Still Be a Virgin, Right?

Within the residence of the Second Elder of Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai devoured his food ravenously, while Su Mu and the others sat nearby, engaging him in conversation.

Naturally, the group was also curious about why Su Yan had struck Yang Kai so harshly that night, but Yang Kai dared not reveal the truth.

“By the way, Wei Zhuang hasn’t troubled you again, has he?” Yang Kai shifted the topic. Ever since that day leaving the Forest Prison, he had been unconscious, then frozen inside an ice block. He truly had no idea how the sect had handled the matter.

“That incident is behind us now. From the elders down to us younger disciples, no one is dwelling on it anymore,” Su Mu replied. Then, with a hint of puzzlement, he looked at Yang Kai and said, “Actually, the reason we came through unscathed this time isn’t thanks to my grandfather.”

“Hm?” Yang Kai looked up. “Isn’t it because of the Second Elder’s intervention?”

“No,” Su Mu shook his head slowly, somewhat embarrassed as he recounted what had happened in the Elder Hall that day. “Just as my grandfather was about to take action, guess who showed up?”

“Who?”

“You’d never guess—it was Shopkeeper Meng from the Contribution Hall. He brought the Sect Leader’s jade pendant and an oral decree from the Sect Leader himself. That’s what turned a major crisis into a minor one, and a minor one into nothing.”

“Old Meng?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

“If not for him, Brother Yang, you’d probably be severely punished by the Grand Elder right now,” Su Mu said, his face full of guilt.

Yang Kai laughed carefreely. “No need to worry about it, Junior Brother Su.”

Su Mu bowed repeatedly. “I know you’re magnanimous, Senior Brother. I apologize on behalf of my grandfather. That old ghost really acted improperly this time.”

Yang Kai paid it no mind. Power struggles among the higher-ups often used disciples as pawns; this was human nature.

Su Mu continued, “Shopkeeper Meng’s origins are mysterious. That old ghost said his strength is unfathomable. I just don’t understand why he would get involved in this matter, and even have a relationship with the Sect Leader.”

Yang Kai pondered. “Old Meng is the type to take advantage wherever possible. If he went to such lengths, he must have an agenda. But no matter what, he helped us, and we should thank him—and find out what he wants.”

“You’re right, Senior Brother. We’ve been waiting for you to come with us,” Su Mu said.

“Then let’s go now.”

Wasting no time, the group set off in a grand procession toward the Contribution Hall.

Inside the Contribution Hall, Shopkeeper Meng was unusually not asleep but sitting behind the counter, smiling warmly at Yang Kai and his companions, as if expecting them.

Su Mu put on a polite smile and said, “Greetings, Grandpa Meng!”

In the past, this second-generation scion would have called Shopkeeper Meng “that old geezer” without hesitation, but now, Su Mu dared not be disrespectful.

Shopkeeper Meng smiled faintly. “You’re quite well-behaved, boy.”

“Heh heh,” Su Mu replied awkwardly.

“Are you here to express your thanks?” Shopkeeper Meng glanced at the group.

“Yes,” they all nodded.

“Very well. Yang Kai, stay behind. The rest of you may leave.”

“Yes, sir!” Su Mu and the others did not hesitate. Their feet had barely warmed the floor before they bowed and hurriedly left. Once outside, they realized that Shopkeeper Meng’s help was all because of Yang Kai. Otherwise, why single him out to stay behind?

But... why help Yang Kai?

Inside the Contribution Hall, Yang Kai asked with curiosity, “Shopkeeper Meng, what do you want from me?”

He did not beat around the bush but directly voiced his suspicion.

Meng Wuya chuckled and stepped out from behind the counter, hands clasped behind his back. He circled Yang Kai several times before raising his head and asking, “What do you think I want from you?”

“I don’t know.” Yang Kai rolled his eyes inwardly, thinking, If I knew, I wouldn’t be asking you.

Meng Wuya said, “Since you’re so straightforward, I won’t beat around the bush. You should be someone who knows how to repay kindness. I helped you escape this time because I want you to do me a favor.”

Yang Kai frowned. “A favor? What could I possibly do for you?”

Shopkeeper Meng’s strength was profound. If even he couldn’t handle something, how could Yang Kai?

Seeming to sense his concern, Meng Wuya smiled. “Don’t worry. It’s nothing dangerous. As long as you meet the conditions, not only is there no danger, but there’s also a great reward waiting for you.”

Yang Kai keenly noticed a subtle pained expression flash across Shopkeeper Meng’s face as he spoke the last sentence.

“A favor with conditions?” Yang Kai grew more confused. He had never seen anyone so picky when asking for help.

Meng Wuya said, “Not only must you meet my conditions, but another person must also be satisfied.”

“That’s too troublesome. No thanks.” Yang Kai turned to leave.

“Wait!” Shopkeeper Meng panicked. After all the trouble to find someone who fits the bill, how could he let him walk away?

“Little Yang Kai, you can’t do this. Remember, a drop of kindness should be repaid with a gushing spring. I am your lifesaver—how can you break my heart?”

“Then stop beating around the bush. Tell me what it is. If I can help, I will; if not, you can find someone else.”

“Give me your hand. I want to check your Primordial Qi.” Shopkeeper Meng no longer dared to tease.

Yang Kai eyed him suspiciously but extended his hand, trusting that Shopkeeper Meng would not harm him.

Meng Wuya reached out two fingers, pressing them to Yang Kai’s wrist with a serious expression, probing carefully. His face shifted through several emotions: first casual, then serious, and finally astonished. The change was so rapid it left one speechless.

“Excellent, excellent! Such pure True Yang Yuan Qi!” Meng Wuya withdrew his hand, overjoyed.

“Is this favor related to the Primordial Qi I cultivated?” Yang Kai guessed.

“Of course,” Meng Wuya nodded vigorously. “Otherwise, why would I seek you out? Little Yang Kai, I have one more question. You must answer honestly.”

“What question?”

Meng Wuya’s expression suddenly grew awkward, his eyes darting nervously as he carefully chose his words. After a long moment, he asked with a mixture of anxiety and anticipation, “You must still be a virgin, right?”

So nervous was he that his neck stretched out long, his face nearly pressed against Yang Kai’s, eyes fixed intently.

Yang Kai immediately took two steps back, then three more, goosebumps rising as he shivered involuntarily, warily asking, “What are you doing?”

This old fellow—does he have some strange fetish? Such a ridiculous question!

“Why run so far away? I’m not going to eat you!” Meng Wuya pursued relentlessly, cornering Yang Kai against the wall. In a low, mysterious voice, he asked, “Are you really still a virgin?”

“What exactly do you want?” Yang Kai braced himself, ready to take him down in a mutual destruction if necessary.

“Just what do you take me for?” Meng Wuya finally realized Yang Kai’s demeanor and blushed deeply. He quickly stepped back a few paces. “It’s not what you think. How could you be so filthy-minded, boy!”
