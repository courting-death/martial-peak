## Chapter 412 — This Man's Appetite Is Great

"Reason? I can't clearly explain it, but Father, have I ever made a judgment that disappointed you since I was young?"

Qiu Shoucheng’s expression grew serious as he considered her words. Indeed, his daughter’s judgment of people and matters was remarkably accurate. There were times in recent years when he himself failed to understand certain events, yet after talking with her, she had already seen through everything and often offered him good advice.

Qiu Yimeng spoke with such solemnity that Qiu Shoucheng found himself compelled to reconsider. He sat upright and asked gravely, "What is it about this man that catches your attention?"

Qiu Yimeng slowly shook her head. "I truly can't put it into words, but this man is extraordinary. He often accomplishes things that seem impossible, achieving the unimaginable and giving people a refreshing sense of surprise."

She had intended to tell her father that the Enchantress Queen of the Cangyun Evil Land had already been captured in both body and heart by Yang Kai, but she reconsidered and kept silent.

After all, Cangyun Evil Land was a place teeming with demons and devils, and Shan Qingluo was one of the Six Evil Kings, perpetually at odds with the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu. Whether Shan Qingluo would come to assist Yang Kai in this succession war was still uncertain.

Without the Enchantress Queen’s aid, the support Yang Kai possessed would undoubtedly be drastically diminished.

"A refreshing surprise?" Qiu Shoucheng's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze heavy with meaning.

Qiu Ziru raised his brows with a light laugh. "It seems Sister Yimeng has finally met a man worthy of her. I always thought there was no man in this world who could meet your standards."

The two elder men—one suspicious, the other intentionally probing—revealed plainly that they already suspected Qiu Yimeng harbored feelings for Yang Kai.

"I do have some affection for him," Qiu Yimeng admitted unexpectedly. "But it’s only a fondness because when I'm with him, I am always on the defensive."

Qiu Shoucheng was moved. "Is that little girl really that strong-willed?"

Her reputation was that none could keep her on the defensive even in Zhongdu. She always led others by the nose. Though that comment seemed routine, Qiu Shoucheng perceived significant information beneath the surface.

"He is a very strong-willed man!" Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly, biting her teeth slightly as she recalled Yang Kai's attitude and actions toward her.

"Love makes people foolish." Qiu Ziru shook his head with the air of an old hand in matters of the heart, as if he had witnessed countless worldly affairs.

"Father," Qiu Yimeng knew her younger half-brother still held grievances against her and had no intention of arguing. Instead, she smiled softly and said, "Let's not speak about my feelings for him. Talk about your own judgment. Your prediction that he would be the third to be eliminated is partly based on information you gathered yourself, but the other part—perhaps it’s influenced by Lü Liang’s message?"

"That’s correct," Qiu Shoucheng nodded, stroking his goatee. "Although Lü Liang did not pass judgment explicitly in his letter, he recounted everything Yang Kai did in the Lü Family. From that, I could see Lü Liang’s contempt for him."

"What if that was just a disguise?"

Qiu Shoucheng’s expression flickered briefly and became solemn. "Then that man is too cunning. To deceive Lü Liang is no small feat; Lü Liang is not easily fooled."

Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly as she rose from her seat and walked a few steps before turning back. "Father, actually, I had been hesitant about tying the Qiu Family’s fate to his. Until today, I was undecided, but now, I increasingly feel that my judgment was correct."

"Reason?"

"It’s because of his inaction! His inaction in the Lü Family, and his inaction after returning to Zhongdu! He neither tried to woo Lü Liang in the Lü Family nor made friends among the Seven Great Families in Zhongdu. But I have spent some time with him and know he is not one to settle for mediocrity. This man’s appetite is enormous; he either makes no move or goes all out without giving his enemies any respite! His very inaction shows his confidence!"

Qiu Yimeng frowned as she shook her head. "I honestly don’t know where his confidence comes from, but he definitely has it."

"Sister, after all this you’re only guessing and feeling this way. We haven’t seen any clear support or allies he has."

Qiu Shoucheng frowned. "Yes, Yimeng, you said you hadn’t considered allying with him. Is there another candidate?"

Hearing this, Qiu Yimeng realized her previous effort had fallen short. Her father still did not favor Yang Kai; otherwise, he wouldn’t have asked that question.

"Besides Yang Kai, I have two others in mind. The eldest, Yang Wei, and the second, Yang Zhao. Yang Zhao needs no introduction; he is very formidable and the son of the current Yang Family head. There has long been strong support for his claim. As for Yang Wei, he is extraordinary—he is the only Divine Roaming Realm cultivator among the younger generation of the Yang Family, and the acknowledged leader of that generation. Both have a great chance," Qiu Yimeng said, forcing a bitter smile. "But now, both have already allied with members of the Seven Great Families. If our Qiu Family were to join in, it might complicate things."

"Indeed. Even if we win, the Qiu Family would gain little," Qiu Shoucheng mused. Then he suddenly turned to his son. "Ziru, what do you think?"

Qiu Ziru’s face lit up; he immediately sensed an opportunity. It was the first time his father had asked his opinion on a matter as significant as the succession war, and he understood the implication.

"In my opinion, if we are to participate in the succession war, we should seek an alliance with a member of the Yang Family who has no backing from the Seven Great Families. That way, after victory, the Qiu Family could claim exclusive benefits," Qiu Ziru said confidently. After hearing his father and sister talk at length, he already had a plan in mind. "I suggest forming an alliance with the sixth son, Yang Shen. His younger brother, the seventh son Yang Ying, is already allied with the Kang Family. Adding our Qiu Family would give us a strong chance to compete on equal footing with Yang Zhao and Yang Kang—the pair of brothers."

Qiu Shoucheng smiled approvingly and nodded.

Sensing his father's approval, Qiu Ziru’s breath quickened, his face flushed with excitement.

Qiu Yimeng shook her head helplessly, sighing sadly.

No matter how outstanding she appeared, she was still a daughter. The Qiu Family’s future inheritance was not hers. Her fate was only that of a pawn used for marriage alliances to bring greater benefit to the Qiu Family.

Silence fell over the room. Qiu Shoucheng drummed his fingers softly on the chair’s surface, lost in deep thought. His brow furrowed as he weighed the gains and losses.

After a long while, his gaze grew firm. "Very well, then this succession war..."

"Father!" Qiu Yimeng quickly interrupted.

"What is it?" Qiu Shoucheng frowned, looking at her with a hint of displeasure.

"Father, for this succession war, I want to lead a team to join Yang Kai!" Qiu Yimeng said stubbornly. Though she knew this would displease her father, she firmly trusted her judgment.

Qiu Ziru snorted quietly.

After staring at her for a long time, Qiu Shoucheng said softly, "You insist on this?"

"Yes! I have never asked you for much, but this time, I insist. Just treat it as my reckless demand."

"Very well. I will assign you the Qiu Family’s Autumn Rain Hall."

Qiu Yimeng smiled bitterly. 

Autumn Rain Hall was not an important branch within the Qiu Family. Its members were not very powerful and few in number. For her father to assign such a branch to her showed he was prepared to sacrifice all of Autumn Rain Hall. Had she not spoken so firmly, he might not have even handed this hall over.

If that was the case, time would prove who was right and who better deserved to inherit the Qiu Family!

Qiu Yimeng's eyes hardened, a fierce determination flashing in them.

"Leave now," Qiu Shoucheng waved his hand, and Qiu Yimeng bowed and withdrew.

Outside the door, the soft conversation of her father and brother reached her ears. The words only deepened the ache in Qiu Yimeng’s heart.

That night, in the main hall of the Tongtian Inn’s backyard, the Bamboo Segment Gang headquarters.

Yang Kai gazed calmly at the stack of silver notes before him.

Behind him stood two men like iron towers. Since entering, they had remained silent, but their faces were pale as paper. Cold sweat occasionally seeped from their brows, and their expressions flickered with grimaces of pain. Their clothes were stained dark red from the blood seeping through from within, as if embroidered with clusters of scarlet buds.

Their feet stood upon blood seals.

The Bamboo Segment Gang’s leader, Pang Chi, and deputy leader, Mu Nandou, flanked them cautiously, occasionally inspecting the two men who seemed near death, puzzled as to why Yang Kai kept such people nearby.

"In the past few days, our two factions have combined forces and consumed two small stage powers. The Bamboo Segment Gang’s strength has greatly increased, and we have seized a considerable amount of resources and money. Master Kai, the accounts are all here, not a cent missing!" Pang Chi respectfully handed a ledger to Yang Kai, placing it before him.

"No need," Yang Kai shook his head. "Exchange all these silver notes for materials. Aim for a higher grade, at least Heaven-Grade materials. The more valuable the better. Also, how many stage powers remain in the Northern District to consume?"

"If Mu brother’s intelligence is correct, there are about four or five more," Pang Chi replied.

"Good. You two, each take one person and go subdue those remaining four or five stage powers," Yang Kai pointed behind him.

"Take... take them?" Pang Chi and Mu Nandou were dumbfounded, staring at the two bloodied men behind Yang Kai.

What could these two possibly accomplish? Pang Chi and Mu Nandou dared not speak loudly, fearing even their voices might shatter the two men. Hearing Yang Kai say this, they were puzzled and confused.
