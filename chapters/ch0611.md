## Chapter 611 — Is This Man Insane?

So when Shui Ling heard Yang Kai make such a request, she grew somewhat excited.

Zi Mo ground her teeth and said, "I knew it — you bastard aren't coming to return my freedom out of kindness. You must have other motives."

Yang Kai chuckled.

Zi Mo shot him a reproachful glance, her expression turning serious. "The Wasteland has been rather unsettled lately."

"Oh? How so?" Yang Kai's interest was piqued.

"For a long time, the experts on Tianlang's side have suspected that the Wasteland conceals some earth-shattering secret, and people often go in to probe it. Not long ago several powers joined forces and entered the Wasteland. If you were to go in now and were discovered, it would surely cause ripples; at your current cultivation, you're more likely to meet misfortune than good fortune."

"You needn't worry about that. Since I dare to go in, naturally I'm not afraid of those people."

Zi Mo snorted. "Still that arrogant tone."

After a moment's thought she said, "Wait here; I'll report back to my master. If my master permits me to go out, I'll take you there. If not... I'll point out the route and you can find it yourselves. It's not too difficult to locate."

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Zi Mo once more plunged into the mountain's interior and disappeared.

The young women continued to appraise Yang Kai and Shui Ling with curiosity. Shui Ling munched on a piece of fruit; Yang Kai maintained a calm expression, quietly waiting and paying no heed to their speculation.

After a while Zi Mo returned with a pleased look and called out, "Master says, since you saved my life, I must help you this time. Come with me."

Yang Kai smiled faintly, rose to his feet, and, with Shui Ling, followed Zi Mo outward.

They walked along the mountain corridor for a long time and again came to the great stone; Zi Mo moved it aside and the three exited the mountain's interior.

No sooner had they emerged than Yang Kai's brow furrowed; he looked impatiently in a certain direction.

Zi Mo likewise knit her brows and stared that way.

From that direction a group of men rapidly approached, led by a youth whose face bore a mocking expression as he looked toward them.

That youth plainly possessed Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage cultivation, seemingly of decent talent, and most of the people beside him also cultivated in the Divine Roaming Realm. There were not many of them, roughly a dozen or so.

The group strode bluntly forward and blocked the trio's path, sneering.

Once they saw Shui Ling and Yang Kai's attire, the group frowned, especially at Shui Ling's pale-blue hair. The youth showed marked interest, repeatedly scanning her; a lecherous glint flashed intermittently in his eyes.

Shui Ling's beauty was striking, and combined with her unusual hair she naturally became a focal point at times.

"Xing Bao, what are you doing here again?" Zi Mo stepped forward and barked at the youth, her pretty face full of disgust.

The youth called Xing Bao chuckled, unhurried: "Junior Sister Zi, that's an amusing remark. This is Senluo Palace territory — why can't I come? Oh, right, you are no longer a disciple of Senluo Palace; I should call you Miss Zi!"

As he spoke, his face was full of smugness.

The men behind him wore mocking, gloating expressions.

Zi Mo's delicate body trembled slightly as she snorted coldly. "My Insect Controlling Branch only temporarily left Senluo Palace; we have not severed ties with our sect."

"Miss Zi, do you not know that the Palace Lord has already ordered your Insect Controlling Branch expelled from Senluo Palace? Otherwise why would your old master bring you to live here? Since you are no longer disciples of Senluo Palace, you cannot remain on its grounds. You'd better leave at once — if you dare stay, you'll pay dearly."

Zi Mo's face turned ashen. "Must you be so heartless?"

"Hmph — useless to me, so why should I want you?" Xing Bao snorted, then laughed and said, "But it's not without negotiation. If you can persuade your old master to submit to my father, you may return to Senluo Palace."

"Foolish delusion," Zi Mo sneered in contempt. "You expect my master to submit to your father? In your dreams."

Xing Bao slowly shook his head. "Obstinately unrepentant — you will all pay the price."

As he spoke he waved his hand and shouted, "Seize those two Great Han warriors and bring them here; let Miss Zi see what happens to those who offend us!"

At his command, those behind him moved swiftly, grinning savagely as they lunged at Yang Kai and Shui Ling.

For certain special reasons, Xing Bao was reluctant to harm members of Zi Mo's branch, but Yang Kai and Shui Ling looked unmistakably like Great Han warriors, so he had no scruples.

Yang Kai shook his head in resignation.

He had long sensed something amiss with Senluo Palace and had refrained from asking Zi Mo what had occurred, fearing to be drawn into the dispute and lose time; yet he had not expected trouble to find him before he left.

Shui Ling turned and glanced at him, apparently awaiting his instruction.

Yang Kai looked up at the sky with an expression of detached indifference.

Shui Ling snorted, lifted her fair hand and pointed. One by one strange water bubbles manifested before the charging men.

The bubbles were only palm-sized at first, but when the men's bodies touched them they suddenly expanded, splitting open a seam and, catching them off-guard, wrapped them inside.

The once threatening warriors instantly resembled drowning cats, struggling and writhing but unable to break free of the water membranes; all hung suspended in midair.

Shui Ling raised her hand again, and Xing Bao was immediately encased in a bubble as well.

A dozen people, a dozen bubbles, suspended in midair. No matter how they strained or unleashed their True Yuan, they could not break the thin water membranes. All were thrown into panic and terror.

Zi Mo stood by with her mouth agape, seemingly not expecting such formidable power from this girl whose hair was unlike others'.

And her methods were so uncanny.

"Bitch, let me out!" Xing Bao flailed in midair, seemingly losing his balance, shouting at Shui Ling, "If you dare hurt me, you're dead meat."

"Outrageous!" Shui Ling replied with visible disgust. Still, since this was another's territory she did not wish to go too far — she only intended to teach them a lesson.

Unexpectedly, Xing Bao took no hint and grew more arrogant. Seeing Shui Ling refrain from killing, he immediately composed himself and bellowed, "I'll remember you, you damned girl. When I'm free I'll have my father capture you and have you properly taught; my father is the Lord of Senluo Palace — prepare to be ravaged by me, hahahaha."

Yang Kai was astonished, staring at Xing Bao as if at a fool, and softly asked Zi Mo, "What's wrong with this man? Is he insane?"

Zi Mo gave no response, staring dumbly at Shui Ling.

Shui Ling finally truly showed her ire. She shot Xing Bao a cold, ominous glance, clenched her small hand, and the dozen or so bubbles suddenly contracted.

"No!" Zi Mo cried in alarm.

Pop, pop, pop...

The sounds of the bubbles bursting sounded one after another, and bursts of blood bloomed like roses.

Not a single corpse remained; all were reduced to gore and blood.

Zi Mo's delicate body trembled.

"What did you do?" Yang Kai snapped back to himself and angrily shouted at Shui Ling; he had not expected her to act so suddenly.

Shui Ling felt aggrieved. "They spoke insolently — I killed them, didn't I?"

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache.

"What's the matter?" Shui Ling asked him, bewildered. "What's wrong with killing a few people? You've killed so many — are you afraid of the dead?"

"The dead are not the real problem, but this is on someone else's turf," Yang Kai sighed. "This is trouble."

"Yes, trouble." Zi Mo looked at Yang Kai, utterly speechless, thinking that she truly should have no further ties with this man — this bastard came to Tianlang and already brought them such great trouble.

Yang Kai shrugged. "The dead cannot be brought back. Mourn them."

A figure suddenly appeared in midair, his gaze coldly fixed on the scene below before turning to Yang Kai. "Young friend, can that phrase extinguish the Palace Lord of Senluo Palace's anger?"

"Probably not," Yang Kai chuckled.

"Master!" Zi Mo cried, "I'm sorry, I couldn't—"

The elder in midair raised his hand and shook his head. "It's not your fault; they killed those people."

As he spoke, a dignified aura pressed downward, suffused with murderous intent and ill will.

Yang Kai stepped forward, serene and unafraid as he looked at the elder. "What do you intend to do, senior?"

"I intend to seize you and send you to Senluo Palace so the Lord can deal with you, lest my Insect Controlling Branch be implicated," the elder replied in a deep voice.

"Master!" Zi Mo exclaimed. Before she could finish, the elder waved and sent out a force that bound Zi Mo in place, clearly unwilling to let her interrupt.

Zi Mo panicked and frantically signaled Yang Kai to flee.

Her master was a Transcendent Realm expert; Yang Kai, a Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage, could not possibly resist.

Hearing the elder's words, Yang Kai nodded lightly. "It is only natural you would do so. But if you think you have the ability, by all means go ahead."

He looked composed and carefree, as if he had never learned the meaning of death.

The elder's expression turned severe; he stared deeply at Yang Kai, puzzled by his calm confidence. After a long moment he suddenly laughed aloud, "Interesting, interesting. Are the warriors from the Great Han side all so wanton?"

"Not entirely," Yang Kai frowned; the elder's sudden withdrawal of killing intent puzzled him.

The elder said, "Hm. You killed them, and I should arrest you, but I suddenly do not wish to do so. You are so arrogant, young friend — you must have some means. I shall see how you escape the Lord of Senluo Palace's pursuit."

Saying this, he released Zi Mo's bindings and called aloud, "Zi Mo, lead them to the Wasteland and tell them never to return to my Senluo Palace."

With that, his figure flickered and he vanished.

Zi Mo, freed, rejoiced, "Thank you, Master."
