## Chapter 2263 — Rain of Spiritual Qi

"Rude?" Zhuang Pan barked, laughing coldly. "In what way do you intend to be rude? This Deacon would very much like to see how you, Duan Yuanshan, plan to be rude to me."

“Hit me, go on, hit me! If you’ve got the guts, hit me!” Zhuang Pan shoved his face right in front of Duan Yuanshan and the others, shouting and provoking them incessantly.

All the martial artists around shook their heads in contempt.

Although most of these outsiders were meeting Zhuang Pan for the first time and hadn’t even heard of him before, a person’s character becomes clear after just a few words.

Zhuang Pan was undoubtedly the type to become arrogant when given a little power, utterly despicable.

The heads of several major families of Fenglin City, who had just arrived, also looked gloomy, sharing a sense of sorrow for a fellow sufferer.

Over the years, under the City Lord’s management, the major families had their share of minor conflicts, but nothing ever escalated into a real, damaging war. Most of the time, the City Lord’s Mansion served as a buffer and mediator, so everyone trusted it. Now, seeing both the City Lord and Vice City Lord, along with the Qin Family Head, being humiliated by Zhuang Pan, they all felt deeply troubled.

"Pa..." A crisp sound rang out, echoing through the world.

Everyone froze, cold sweat breaking out on their faces, thinking: "Did he really hit him? Was the City Lord really that bold?"

In confusion, all eyes turned to look.

The next moment, everyone understood.

They saw a figure standing before Zhuang Pan, rolling his neck and flexing his wrists, clearly preparing for a thorough beating.

“Who! Who dares hit me?” Zhuang Pan was stunned by the slap, half his face swelling up and going numb. His head was knocked to the side, so he didn’t see who did it. Once he came to his senses, he screamed hysterically, “Who was it... uh...?”

Before he could finish, he saw Yang Kai grinning at him, baring his white fangs like a beast about to devour him. A chill ran from head to toe, and he swallowed the rest of his threats.

“How interesting...” Yang Kai said, slapping him again.

"Pa..." Another crisp sound rang out, and the other side of Zhuang Pan’s face swelled up, several bloody teeth flying out.

Yang Kai grabbed his collar, holding him in place. With his other hand, he began slapping him, each blow heavier than the last, Origin Qi surging with every strike.

"Pa pa pa..."

The rhythmic slaps echoed across the wilderness.

“In this world...” Yang Kai sneered as he slapped, “there are actually people... who beg others to hit them. Such a pure and unique wish... this is the first time I’ve heard it, so I’ve decided... to satisfy you!”

Watching this, all the martial artists suddenly felt their own faces ache, unconsciously touching their cheeks.

Zhuang Pan was completely stunned. After a while, he started struggling, trying to break free from Yang Kai’s grip.

But with his First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, how could he? Yang Kai’s Origin Qi suppressed his strength, leaving him unable to move at all.

In despair, Zhuang Pan cried out, begging for mercy: “Lord Yang, stop, please stop. Don’t hit me anymore.”

“Lord Yang, I was wrong, I really was wrong. Let me go, I’ll apologize!”

“I’m a Deacon of Fei Sheng Palace, let me go!”

“Bastard! A man can be killed but not humiliated. If you keep this up, I’ll fight you to the death...”

“Wuwuwu... Lord Yang, spare my life, I don’t want to die!”

The surrounding martial artists watched this scene unfold, hearing Zhuang Pan’s words and feeling only contempt. Each of them inwardly scorned him for his utter lack of dignity—such a man truly deserved no pity.

After dozens of slaps, Zhuang Pan’s face was unrecognizable.

Earlier, when Yang Kai beat Ning Yuanshu, he hadn’t gone all out, since Ning Yuanshu’s status was special—his father was an Emperor Realm master, and Yang Kai didn’t want to make things too extreme and bring trouble on himself.

But with Zhuang Pan, it was different. Every slap from Yang Kai was infused with Origin Qi. After dozens of blows, all of Zhuang Pan’s meridians were shattered.

In other words, even if Zhuang Pan survived, he would be a cripple, with no cultivation and no hope of ever training again.

“Brother Yang...” Duan Yuanshan looked at Zhuang Pan’s miserable state, feeling a bit of pity. “Let it go. Cowardice and desertion are his nature. He didn’t really do anything to us. Just give him a quick end.”

The Drunken Old Man burped, his narrowed eyes flashing coldly. “If you don’t kill the snake, it’ll bite you later. Letting the tiger return to the mountain will bring disaster!”

As he spoke, he suddenly reached out toward Zhuang Pan’s head.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, pushed the Drunken Old Man’s hand away, and smiled. “No need to trouble the Deputy City Lord with such a small matter.”

The Drunken Old Man was not in a position to act, but Yang Kai was different. He’d already beaten Ning Yuanshu, so killing Zhuang Pan would be nothing. His grudge with Fei Sheng Palace was nothing new.

As he finished speaking, he shook his hand, pouring a surge of Origin Qi into Zhuang Pan, then flung him into the air.

“Aaaah...” Zhuang Pan screamed miserably, but his cry was cut short as his body exploded, turning into a bloody rain that splattered down.

The surrounding martial artists were silent as cicadas in winter.

But thinking of how Yang Kai had previously killed even the Deputy Valley Lord of Evil Moon Valley, they felt this scene was nothing remarkable.

Duan Yuanshan and the Drunken Old Man both looked at Yang Kai with gratitude, as if thanking him for cleansing Fenglin City.

Just then, the world’s Spiritual Qi trembled, and an indescribable sensation burst in all directions. Next, a rumbling sound like muffled thunder rolled up from deep underground.

Everyone was startled, looking around in all directions.

"Did anyone else notice... the world’s Spiritual Qi suddenly became much denser?" a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm martial artist asked.

Someone immediately replied, “I felt it earlier, but thought it was just me. Since Brother Liu says so, it must be real!”

“If there’s a change in the world’s Spiritual Qi, it’s likely something happened to the mineral and earth veins!”

At these words, everyone’s eyes lit up. After exchanging glances, they all used their movement skills and sped toward the location of the mineral and earth veins.

As the true masters of this place, Duan Yuanshan and the Drunken Old Man could hardly stand by and do nothing. After exchanging a quick word with Yang Kai, they too joined the crowd, vanishing in pursuit of the earth and mineral veins.

“Brother Yang...” Qin Chaoyang looked at Yang Kai. “It seems the commotion earlier wasn’t caused by Luo Yuan and the two Elders fighting, but by the earth and mineral veins underground.”

“That must be it!” Yang Kai nodded. He’d also thought the disturbance was from Luo Yuan and the two Elders’ battle, but now it seemed there was another reason.

“Should we go take a look?” Qin Chaoyang asked for Yang Kai’s opinion.

“Something this interesting, of course we should see it.” Yang Kai grinned, about to leave, when he caught sight of Ye Qinghan of Chiyue Sect standing quietly nearby, watching her.

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

This woman clung to him like a dogskin plaster, impossible to shake off, and it steadily ground down his patience.

Seeing Yang Kai’s displeasure, Ye Qinghan sensibly retreated a step, her face sorrowful, making her look quite pitiful.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai said, then flew toward the source of the disturbance.

Before they even arrived, they saw multicolored auspicious clouds covering the sky in the distance. In an instant, the wilderness seemed to become a paradise on earth.

“What’s going on?” Qin Chaoyang was baffled.

Last time, when Demonic Qi surrounded the city, they’d come to the sealed land, hoping Qin Yu could reinforce the seal. Although they failed, they hadn’t noticed anything unusual in the sealed land—other than endless Demonic Qi, there was nothing else.

But just a few months later, so many earth and mineral veins had been discovered here, leaving everyone astonished.

Boom...

With a loud bang, Yang Kai saw a huge hole suddenly appear in the ground. From within, a pillar of light shot up to the sky.

Within the pillar, fluorescent light spiraled upward, piercing the clouds above.

“This is...”

“My heavens.”

“There’s actually something like this in the world?”

All the martial artists cried out, looking up at the pillar of light. Releasing their Divine Sense, they quickly discovered its true nature.

It was formed from the purest Spiritual Qi, so dense it was nearly liquefied.

Everyone was shocked, unable to contain their excitement.

The purity and density of this Spiritual Qi was unimaginable. Though none of the martial artists here came from truly noble backgrounds, they were at least from mid-tier sects and families. In those places, there were Sacred Lands for cultivation, where the Spiritual Qi was much denser than elsewhere, allowing disciples to train and advance much faster.

But now, everyone realized that the Spiritual Qi in their own Sacred Lands was nothing compared to this place—it was like heaven and earth, utterly incomparable.

Perhaps only the blessed lands of the very top sects could compare to this scene.

As they reeled in shock, the top of the pillar of light suddenly burst, and unimaginably dense Spiritual Qi radiated outward in all directions.

Drip drip drip...

It began to rain from the sky.

It was a rain of Spiritual Qi.

Across the wilderness, the density of Spiritual Qi soared at an astonishing rate, rising and rising...

In a very short time, everyone was immersed in a sea of Spiritual Qi.
