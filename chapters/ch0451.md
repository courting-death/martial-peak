## Chapter 451 — The Method of Cultivating Divine Sense

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and stretched his somewhat numb body. Looking down, he saw that he was still holding his Senior Sister in his arms; the two of them had not moved from this position.

Senior Sister’s mind was still immersed in her Sea of Consciousness, digesting the alchemy knowledge and essentials Yang Kai had taught her.

As for the True Alchemy Formula, Yang Kai had already taught all he knew to Xia Ningshang; the rest he had yet to uncover himself and would have to deal with that in due time.

Gazing at the delicate young girl nearby with a veil covering her face, Yang Kai bent down to plant a gentle kiss. Then, he quietly rose and placed her on the bed.

Opening the door, Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over him.

He had spent a long time discussing True Alchemy Formula with Xia Ningshang and lingering in her Sea of Consciousness, which had drained his Divine Sense energy greatly.

Standing outside was a sweet-faced young maid. Seeing Yang Kai come out, she hurried over with small steps, carrying a tray holding a steaming large bowl.

“Young Master, you finally came out,” the maid said with a bright smile, looking directly at him.

“What’s the matter?” Yang Kai frowned.

“This is something Miss Qiu instructed me to prepare. She said you should replenish your body properly. Eat it while it’s hot.”

Yang Kai was surprised, pondering why Qiu Yimeng was so thoughtful. Hesitating for a moment, he asked casually, “What is this?”

The girl’s face flushed slightly as she whispered, “I don’t know. Miss Qiu only said it’s for nourishing the kidneys and strengthening yang…”

Yang Kai’s face darkened; what exactly was Qiu Yimeng's meaning behind this?

“Hehe, Young Master, enjoy your meal. I’ve reheated it many times,” the maid said, handing over the tray. Yang Kai took it instinctively, and when he came to his senses, the maid had already disappeared.

Looking at the tonic for kidney and yang nourishment in his hand, Yang Kai’s expression was complicated.

Suddenly, the door next door opened, and Meng Wuya came out with a gloomy expression, shooting a disapproving glance at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned at him and drank the bowl of soup in one gulp. Then, he stepped forward and greeted, “Shopkeeper Meng.”

Meng Wuya nodded slightly and waved his hand before turning back inside.

They entered the room and sat down. Meng Wuya looked Yang Kai up and down, eyes filled with inquiry. “You already have Divine Sense? Or is it the power of a treasure?”

The Divine Sense he detected made Shopkeeper Meng aware something unusual was going on, so he naturally wanted to clarify.

“It’s my own cultivation of Divine Sense,” Yang Kai admitted frankly. He had intended to ask Meng Wuya some questions and had no intention of hiding anything.

“That’s impossible!” Despite his strong composure, Shopkeeper Meng’s face revealed shock. Although he had suspected Yang Kai might have cultivated Divine Sense, hearing it confirmed was hard to believe. “Kid, tell me honestly — how did that happen?”

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai chuckled. “Some opportunity and fate, I suppose. Anyway, I cultivated Divine Sense.”

Meng Wuya rolled his eyes, knowing Yang Kai was reluctant to reveal details, but he didn’t press. Everyone had their secrets.

“Still, your Divine Sense is a bit strange.”

“How so?” Yang Kai asked eagerly.

“Too strong,” Meng Wuya replied sternly. “It shouldn’t be this powerful. This Divine Sense rivals that of a peak-level Divine Roaming Realm master, yet you’re only at the Eighth Stage of True Yuan. Just think, if you advanced to Divine Roaming Realm, how much stronger would you become?”

“About that, I want to ask you,” Yang Kai frowned. “Though I have Divine Sense, I don’t have a Sea of Consciousness.”

Meng Wuya snorted. “Of course not. Without reaching Divine Roaming Realm, naturally there is no Sea of Consciousness. The Sea of Consciousness is the hallmark of the Divine Roaming Realm!”

“Isn’t Divine Sense born with cultivation?”

Meng Wuya shook his head slowly. “No. The birth of Divine Sense does not necessarily require reaching the Divine Roaming Realm. I know of others who, like you, cultivated their own Divine Sense before reaching Divine Roaming Realm.”

“Others like me?” Yang Kai’s expression changed with surprise. He had the Warm Spirit Lotus in his mind, which gave him a rare chance to cultivate Divine Sense; but what about them? How did they do it?

“Yes, very few, but there was such a person I know of,” Meng Wuya’s eyes flickered with memory before shaking his head. “It’s an old story, and his case was fleeting. Martial artists focus on cultivating True Yuan early on. True Yuan exists within the dantian and meridians. When reaching Divine Roaming Realm, one cultivates not only True Yuan but also Divine Sense. Like True Yuan, Divine Sense must have a place to be stored — that place is the Sea of Consciousness.”

“Martial artists without a Sea of Consciousness, even if they cultivate Divine Sense, it’s like early spring melting snow, a candle in the wind; it fades away in days. So, that person’s situation was fleeting. But you’re different. Your Divine Sense is solid and powerful, obviously not born recently.” Meng Wuya smiled slightly, gazing meaningfully at Yang Kai. “I don’t know what secrets you’re hiding, but I can be sure you have a method to store your Divine Sense and prevent it from dispersing.”

Yang Kai nodded silently, a trace of admiration on his face.

At Meng Wuya’s level, one could deduce truths from subtle details. Though he might not know of the Warm Spirit Lotus, his deduction was undoubtedly accurate.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense storage was that multicolored Warm Spirit Lotus within his mind.

“Since you have Divine Sense, can you use soul techniques now?” Meng Wuya glanced at him.

“Yes, but I only know one move.”

“One move suffices. Soul techniques, after all, are like martial skills — methods to perfectly express one’s own power. Weaklings need routines; once strong, you don’t need rigid techniques. Free-form creativity is the rule for the powerful.” His tone carried a hint of nostalgia, as if he had once stood among the strong. Pausing, he smirked. “But given your current state, don’t you find your soul technique lacking power?”

“Exactly,” Yang Kai said seriously. “That’s what I want to ask you!”

“Of course it’s insufficient. Your Divine Sense isn’t stored in a Sea of Consciousness, but elsewhere. When you use a soul technique in battle, you have to summon Divine Sense from that place and then execute the technique, causing wasted energy in the process. Once you open your own Sea of Consciousness, this problem will vanish.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai relaxed, though he had guessed before, hearing it from someone else made a difference.

“Shopkeeper Meng, do you have a method specifically to cultivate Divine Sense power?” Yang Kai asked playfully. Currently, he mainly cultivated Divine Sense by studying True Alchemy Formula, but without supplements like pills, progress was slow.

If there was a specific method to cultivate Divine Sense, things would be different. These were rare; he knew the Yang Family had one, but even Fourth Master Yang was unqualified to learn it.

Moreover, even that method wasn’t spectacular.

Martial artists mostly supplemented Divine Sense by rest or pills.

Meng Wuya snorted, “I have such things, but cultivation requires perseverance—no shortcuts possible.”

“Then just teach me!” Yang Kai interrupted with a grin.

Meng Wuya was annoyed but resigned. “Fine, fine. Even if I didn’t teach you, given Ningshang’s nature, she wouldn’t resist your pestering.”

He then shared the method for cultivating Divine Sense.

Yang Kai studied intently, and soon memorized it, looking a little excited. “How much can this method improve Divine Sense?”

“About twenty percent,” Meng Wuya replied casually.

“That little?” Yang Kai was stunned. He expected better from Shopkeeper Meng, but twenty percent was modest.

Meng Wuya sneered, “Don’t be ungrateful. Methods specifically for cultivating Divine Sense are extremely precious. I know your Yang Family has one; the Eight Great Families each have their methods. But none compare to mine. Their methods only improve the recovery and growth speed of Divine Sense by about ten percent at most.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious. He realized now his access to high-level information had been too limited and had underestimated this method’s value.

The Yang Family’s method, if remembered correctly, was an Upper-Level Mystery-Grade secret technique!

Upper-Level Mystery-Grade stood at the very pinnacle of this world, yet it still only improved recovery speed by ten percent. Then this method that boosted it twenty percent... what rank could it be?

Thinking on this, Yang Kai no longer underestimated the method, looking suspiciously at Meng Wuya.

The more contact he had with Shopkeeper Meng, the more mysteries and surprises he found.

Above Mystery-Grade was Spirit-Grade. So what was beyond Divine Roaming Realm? Yang Kai’s mind swirled with questions, but he decided it was better not to ask. He was not yet Divine Roaming Realm; probing such matters might not be wise.

“Learn it well and get lost. Don’t stay so long in Ningshang’s room again,” Meng Wuya brusquely drove him away.

“How long was I there?”

“Five days.”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded. Time had flown by during his discussion of True Alchemy Formula with Senior Sister. No wonder he felt tired and why Qiu Yimeng ordered those tonics.

Staying in Senior Sister’s room for five days straight was definitely cause for misunderstanding.

Surely something had happened during those five days. Yang Kai quickly apologized, then left Meng Wuya’s room and went toward the main hall.
