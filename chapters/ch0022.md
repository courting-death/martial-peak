## Chapter 22 — Rewriting Defeat

Moreover, Yang Kai looked utterly disheveled at this moment, clearly having endured great hardships. How could he possibly still have the strength to fight? On top of that, his thin frame and malnourished appearance made it easy for others to underestimate him.

Almost everyone believed that Yang Kai was doomed today. Even Xia Ningshang, who stood on a nearby large tree, held the same view.

As a Shadow Hall Disciple, Xia Ningshang had come uninvited today to record Yang Kai’s battle record once again.

“This isn’t right. How can I let my junior brother have the upper hand?” Yang Kai hesitated somewhat.

“There’s nothing wrong with it,” Zhao Hu insisted. “As your junior brother, it’s only proper to let you have three moves! Haha!”

“Very well,” Yang Kai said reluctantly. “Since Junior Brother Zhao insists, then Senior Brother will not be polite.”

“Come at me with all you’ve got!” Zhao Hu shouted, planting his feet like boulders. His muscles bulged, veins standing out sharply.

Watching the skinny, scrawny Yang Kai approach step by step, Zhao Hu sneered coldly in his heart. With such a small frame, he thought, I’ll blow you away in one breath. What kind of power could you possibly muster?

Yang Kai slowly walked up to Zhao Hu, raised a fist, and deliberately shook it in front of Zhao Hu’s eyes, smiling, “Junior Brother Zhao, Senior Brother is really going to hit you now.”

“Come!”

No sooner had the words left his mouth than Yang Kai’s fist slammed into Zhao Hu’s chest.

A muffled boom echoed out. The onlookers didn’t even see Yang Kai’s movement clearly, yet the punch landed in a strange and inexplicable manner.

Zhao Hu’s face paled, his chest involuntarily caving inward.

Before anyone could react, a second punch struck Zhao Hu’s abdomen. His body bent sharply, as if a wave of sour liquid was about to spill out.

With a snap, Yang Kai flicked out a kick, hitting Zhao Hu’s chin. Zhao Hu flew backward, crashing to the ground without moving.

Victory!

Silence fell over the crowd, so quiet that even a pin drop could be heard. Everyone stared at Yang Kai in shock, disbelief shining in their eyes. Su Mu’s eyes were especially wide, nearly bursting from their sockets.

Two punches and a kick had sent Zhao Hu, a Body Tempering – Fifth Stage cultivator, flying. Was this something a Body Tempering – Third Stage could accomplish?

Though Zhao Hu hadn’t fought back at all, the force was simply too great. A man weighing barely a hundred pounds was blasted several zhang away. Without strength, how could this be possible? Moreover, the speed was incredibly fast. One moment Zhao Hu was sneering arrogantly, the next he was unconscious.

Not only did the spectators in front of the small hut refuse to believe their eyes, even Xia Ningshang, who was recording the battle from the treetop, was equally stunned.

Her little notebook clearly recorded Yang Kai’s record: one hundred forty-seven defeats in over two years, without a single victory. And now, that record had been rewritten today!

And the victory was so clean and decisive. Xia Ningshang, originally poised and graceful as she stepped lightly on the branches, was so shocked she lost her breath. Her light-footed technique faltered, and her body suddenly sank downward.

With a rustling sound, the masked woman fell three zhang from the treetop, landing on her rear with a sharp cry of pain.

Fortunately, she was agile and quick to react, managing to lessen the impact at the last moment. Otherwise, the fall could have been far more serious. Even so, her two rounded hips burned with pain. She bit her lips tightly, a mist rising in her clear eyes.

Enduring the pain, she slowly stood up. Her long, slender legs trembled slightly. Xia Ningshang anxiously looked around and, seeing no one had noticed her fall, finally breathed a sigh of relief.

If anyone had seen her like this, it would have been a great embarrassment.

Circulating her qi to ease the pain in her hips, Xia Ningshang’s eyes sparkled with curiosity. She truly could not understand how Yang Kai’s strength had increased so much in just a few days.

The onlookers were not skilled enough to discern much, but Xia Ningshang’s sharp eyes were no ordinary matter.

At the moment Yang Kai struck, she clearly felt the surge of qi in his meridians. The presence of qi sense indicated he had already reached Body Tempering – Fourth Stage, and it seemed his strength might even surpass that.

But hadn’t he only just reached Body Tempering – Third Stage a few days ago?

That wretched junior brother! He had been hiding his true strength all along, not only startling everyone else but even causing her to fall from the tree. How infuriating!

Faintly, Xia Ningshang already blamed the pain in her rear on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai glanced toward the direction where Xia Ningshang was hiding. Though her cry had been brief, he had heard it. However, since she was far away and nothing seemed amiss, he did not dwell on it. Instead, he frowned as he looked at his fist, seemingly dissatisfied.

Indeed, Yang Kai was not pleased. After all, this was his first sparring session since acquiring the Proud Bone Golden Body. He had not controlled his strength well and had accidentally sent Zhao Hu flying. Originally, he had only intended to make his opponent move a little, but it seemed his power had exceeded his expectations.

Su Mu was the first to recover and shouted at Yang Kai, “You cheated!”

Yang Kai looked at him calmly. “Junior Brother Su, one can’t eat carelessly, nor speak recklessly. Where did I cheat?”

Su Mu was momentarily speechless. Indeed, where was the cheating? Zhao Hu had stood there arrogantly without moving, boasting that he would let Yang Kai have three moves. Yet Yang Kai had truly defeated him in three moves. This happened openly before everyone’s eyes. How could that be cheating?

“Su Shao, it seems the intelligence was wrong. This kid’s strength is not just Body Tempering – Third Stage! He must have advanced, or else how could he have moved Zhao Hu?” A sharp-eyed observer whispered to Su Mu.

“I see,” Su Mu nodded, his face darkening. “Zhao Hu was too careless. If he had fought seriously, he wouldn’t have been defeated.”

In Su Mu’s mind, Zhao Hu’s loss was purely due to carelessness. After all, even if Yang Kai had advanced, he was still only Body Tempering – Fourth Stage, which was no match for Zhao Hu. If they had truly fought, Yang Kai would have been defeated without doubt.

“Senior Brother Yang, you hide your strength well!” Su Mu glared coldly at Yang Kai, clearly frustrated at not being able to finish the fight in one go.

Yang Kai shrugged noncommittally.

“We have a long road ahead. Next time, you won’t be so lucky!” Su Mu snorted coldly and led his group back the way they came. One of his men carried the unconscious Zhao Hu. Before leaving, Su Mu shot a hateful glare at Yang Kai.

This grudge was truly established. Yang Kai did not mind. The sect had its own rules. If they wanted to cause trouble, they would have to come and challenge him.

Moreover, he needed someone to test his cultivation progress. Otherwise, he would never know how much he had grown. With this thought in mind, Yang Kai considered the enmity with Su Mu a blessing in disguise.

Today’s battle had been somewhat unsatisfying. Yang Kai felt a tinge of dissatisfaction.

Su Mu left, the excitement ended, and the crowd naturally dispersed. Yet many remained in a daze. The Trial Disciple Yang Kai, who had not won a single battle in over two years, had actually won today. Though there was some trickery involved, it was still a victory.
