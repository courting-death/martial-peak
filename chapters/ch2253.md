## Chapter 2253 — Don’t Fail to Appreciate Kindness

“You... you’re just shameless!” Qin Yu stamped her foot in anger. The Qin Family couldn’t match the others in strength, so there was no way they could drive them out by force. If these people from the Eight Directions Sect really insisted on staying, the Qin Family would have no way to deal with them.

What Qin Yu never expected was that, even after things had been said so clearly, the other party still had the face to stay. Such shamelessness was truly rare in her life.

“Hahahaha!” Lin Yun burst out laughing and said, “So what if this Young Master is shameless? Miss Yu, are you going to teach me a lesson? If so, I’ll give you the chance—come with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure flickered and he darted before Qin Yu, forming a claw with one hand and reaching for her shoulder.

The middle-aged man saw this; his expression shifted, but he quickly closed his eyes, pretending not to notice.

The Qin Family’s ingratitude annoyed him, so he couldn’t be bothered to intervene. He just thought this small clan needed to suffer a big loss to learn there’s always someone stronger.

“Get lost!” Qin Chaoyang suddenly roared. He was already beside Qin Yu, and seeing Lin Yun charge at her, how could he just sit by? As he shouted, his whole body’s Origin Qi surged, and a hand large enough to split stone pushed forward. The Origin Qi in his palm was as fierce as a tsunami—he was clearly going all out from the start.

Lin Yun sneered, “Old fool, you don’t know your place. Do you really think you can stop this Young Master?”

As he spoke, he didn’t dodge or evade, but changed his claw to a palm and struck toward Qin Chaoyang’s hand.

A wave of sinister, yin energy rippled out, and in that instant, Lin Yun seemed to transform into a venomous serpent—his tongue flickering, eyes cold and predatory, ready to strike at any moment.

Qin Chaoyang’s expression changed. He realized that if he took this palm head-on, he’d be in for a bad end. After all, he was already old and frail. Though he was at the Dao Origin Realm, his true strength was far from his peak, while the other was young and vigorous, with the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation—he simply couldn’t compete.

But this concerned Qin Yu’s safety. Even knowing he’d be injured, Qin Chaoyang didn’t retreat. A ruthless glint flashed in his eyes as he fiercely pushed his Origin Qi, making his already wild palm strike even more ferocious.

“Overestimating yourself!” Lin Yun clicked his tongue and shook his head slowly, mocking.

Bang...

The two palms collided, and fierce Origin Qi exploded in all directions, whipping up a storm. In an instant, sand and stones flew in the courtyard.

Yet...

A shocking scene unfolded.

At the moment of their clash, Lin Yun’s body suddenly shuddered, his face changed dramatically, and with a miserable cry, he was sent flying backward, spitting blood in midair before crashing into the rear wing room, smashing a huge hole in the wall.

Rumble...

From inside the wing room came a series of crashing sounds, as if Lin Yun couldn’t control his momentum and smashed into many things.

“What?” The middle-aged man and the others from the Eight Directions Sect all stared wide-eyed, dumbfounded at this unbelievable scene.

The Qin Family’s guards, who had been anxious and united against the enemy, were equally shocked, but soon their faces lit up with joy and they cheered.

"Patriarch, you..." Qin Yu’s face was full of confusion. Although her cultivation wasn’t enough to see Lin Yun’s true realm, she could feel he was much stronger than the Patriarch.

But why, with just one move, did the Patriarch send him flying?

This was simply impossible.

Qin Chaoyang was also stunned. He had already prepared himself to be injured, and if the other party refused to let things go, he was ready to risk his old life to protect Qin Yu.

No matter what, he couldn’t just watch Qin Yu be seized and humiliated by Lin Yun.

But the result surprised even him.

Soon, as if realizing something, he turned his head.

The next moment, a smiling face appeared before Qin Chaoyang, and a hand was pressed against his back. From that palm, a pure and powerful Origin Qi poured in.

The force that repelled Lin Yun was clearly due to this person’s secret help!

Qin Chaoyang’s eyes instantly widened, then filled with delight as he exclaimed, “Young Brother Yang!”

He discovered that the one who had secretly helped him was none other than Yang Kai, who hadn’t been in Fenglin City for some time.

“Ah?” Qin Yu was startled when she heard this. Following Qin Chaoyang’s gaze, she saw Yang Kai and couldn’t help but cover her red lips with her hand, trembling as she said, “Lord Yang!”

“Who!” The middle-aged man from the Eight Directions Sect finally came to his senses and shouted, glaring at Yang Kai with a hostile expression. “Who are you, to dare attack my Eight Directions Sect disciple in secret?!”

“Eight Directions Sect?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise, glancing at the middle-aged man and then at the other disciples, but not seeing the person he was looking for. He couldn’t help but sound disappointed, “You’re disciples of the Eight Directions Sect?”

“Absolutely!” The middle-aged man, seeing Yang Kai’s look of having heard of the Eight Directions Sect’s reputation, immediately gained confidence. “Who exactly are you?”

As he spoke, the middle-aged man looked confused. For some reason, Yang Kai seemed familiar, as if he’d seen him somewhere before, but he couldn’t recall exactly.

He said sternly, “No matter who you are, since you’ve injured my Eight Directions Sect disciple, you won’t leave today without giving a proper explanation!”

He spoke with great confidence, because his Divine Sense sweep showed Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, a level he didn’t take seriously at all.

He just didn’t know what secret technique the other had used to help Qin Chaoyang send Lin Yun flying, but it seemed to be some kind of joint force technique, and Lin Yun had just been careless and got caught off guard.

“Huh...” Yang Kai looked at the middle-aged man in surprise. “I really didn’t know the disciples of the Eight Directions Sect were so impressive! Anyone who didn’t know better would think you were from the Star God Palace.”

Yang Kai’s mocking words made the middle-aged man’s face turn blue and white. He gritted his teeth and said, “Enough nonsense! If you know what’s good for you, surrender now and await your punishment — otherwise, don’t expect me to act with any sentiment.”

Yang Kai looked at him strangely and said, “Do I even know you? Since when did we have any sentiment to speak of? How amusing!

As he spoke, he turned his head toward Qin Yu and whispered, “Is something wrong with this guy’s head?”

Seeing his antics, Qin Yu couldn’t help but giggle.

Qin Chaoyang, however, frowned deeply. He knew Yang Kai was no ordinary person—otherwise, he wouldn’t have given up his spot to enter the Four Seasons Land that day. But now, with so many enemies, he wasn’t sure if Yang Kai could handle the situation, so he couldn’t help but worry.

“Brat, you’re courting death!” the middle-aged man shouted angrily.

“Stop yelling!” Yang Kai looked at him with disdain. “How embarrassing.”

After saying this, he ignored the man and turned to Qin Chaoyang. “What’s going on here? I just arrived and heard something about a million Source Crystals... Explain it to me.”

He was telling the truth. After obtaining the Calamity Fruit from the Qingyang Shrine, Yang Kai had rushed straight to Fenglin City. But as soon as he entered, he sensed something was off—there were many more experts than usual.

He hurried to the Qin Family and happened to see Qin Yu trying to drive people out. Not knowing what was going on, he hid in the shadows to observe, only revealing himself when Lin Yun attacked and he had to help Qin Chaoyang.

At Yang Kai’s words, Qin Chaoyang glared resentfully at the middle-aged man and briefly explained what had happened.

After listening, Yang Kai was silent for a long time before looking up at the middle-aged man. “So, to sum up, the Qin Family treated you well, but one of your people killed a servant. Not only did you show no remorse or admit fault, you relied on numbers to try to seize the house and even wanted to abduct the Qin Family’s young lady...”

The middle-aged man fell silent, unable to reply. What Yang Kai said was the truth.

“Tsk tsk... Such bullying and abuse, oppressing men and women, is simply... outrageous!” Yang Kai was full of contempt.

The middle-aged man took a deep breath and said, “I already said, I’m willing to settle things with a million Source Crystals. They’re the ones who don’t know what’s good for them!”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows. “So, according to you, killing someone can be settled for a million Source Crystals? If others don’t accept, they’re the ones failing to appreciate kindness?”

As he spoke, he suddenly raised his hand.

Instantly, a small mountain of Source Crystals appeared in the courtyard. There were so many that it was obvious at a glance there were at least ten million.

Even though the people from the Eight Directions Sect weren’t poor, they were dazzled by the sight, each swallowing hard and wishing they could claim the pile for themselves.

The Qin Family members were even more dumbfounded, not knowing what Yang Kai was up to.

“Come, come.” Yang Kai warmly beckoned the Eight Directions Sect crowd, his face beaming with a bright smile. “Don’t be shy—each of you take a million Source Crystals. No more, no less...”

At this point, his tone suddenly changed, his smile turning into a cold sneer as he said in a low voice, “After you’ve taken them, I’ll send you on your way!”

Thud, thud, thud...

The people from the Eight Directions Sect all retreated several steps, staring at Yang Kai in horror. One of them even shouted, “Are you kidding?!”

Source Crystals were good, but you had to be alive to enjoy them. If you lost your life, what use was a mountain of Source Crystals?

The middle-aged man’s face turned ashen. At this point, how could he not know what Yang Kai intended?

He was clearly using their own methods against them. Realizing this, he sneered, “You don’t seem to be from the Qin Family. Must you get involved in this mess? If you leave now, we might still be friends.”

“Who wants to be friends with you?” Yang Kai curled his lip. “I told you to take them, so take them. Don’t fail to appreciate kindness!”

The middle-aged man was furious and shouted, “It seems we have nothing more to say!”
