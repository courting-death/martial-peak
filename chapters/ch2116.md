## Chapter 2116 — Heaven and Earth Severed Body and The Calamity Fruit

“A wondrous Firmament Tree that sealed the Four Poles and suppressed the void?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “The ancient records state that the Firmament Tree roots itself in the void, and its yin–yang chaotic power runs through heaven and earth, binding and imprisoning the very forces of heaven and earth.”

“So formidable?” Yang Kai was instantly shocked.

Qin Yu smiled faintly and said, “It’s just a record; whether it’s true can’t be verified. But what you described earlier, Sir, is somewhat similar to the Firmament Tree. Perhaps it really is related to the Firmament Tree… who can say for sure?”

“Then the question you asked me earlier…”

“The Firmament Tree is able to seal Heaven and Earth. The power of Yin and Yang Chaos possesses immense might. If, in the scene you saw, that strange tree displayed sealing power, then the Firmament Tree likely truly exists!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s heart trembled violently!

Wasn’t the bi-colored gold-and-silver strange tree planted in the Small Xuan Realm displaying precisely the power of sealing?

Even the demonic intent and Demonic Qi of the Ancient Giant Demon were sealed in his abdomen by that gold and silver power. Clearly, it has a deep connection to the legendary Firmament Tree.

“The Yin and Yang Chaos Power of the Firmament Tree possesses the might to seal all things…” Qin Yu continued, “No wonder that remnant will of the Ancient Giant Demon would manifest this thing. It must be extremely afraid of that sealing power, so even after countless years, it still remembers it.”

“That must be it.” Yang Kai nodded in agreement, and was happy to let Qin Yu misunderstand.

“I have fulfilled your request, Sir. I wonder if you are satisfied with my explanation?” Qin Yu asked with a smile.

“Miss Qin, your knowledge spans ancient and modern times. I am impressed. I am very satisfied with this explanation.”

“You flatter me, Sir!” Qin Yu’s face flushed slightly. She paused, then said, “Mm, the Patriarch seems to have something else to discuss with you, so I’ll take my leave for now.”

Saying so, she opened the barrier of the secret room and turned to walk out.

At the doorway, Qin Yu suddenly halted and looked back. “Sir, about what the Patriarch intends to speak of… if you find it difficult, you may refuse with a single word. There is no need to burden yourself with it.”

After speaking, she didn’t wait for any reaction from Yang Kai and pushed the door open to leave.

Yang Kai frowned and stood in place. He didn’t know what Qin Yu’s last words meant. But… from her tone, it seemed Qin Chaoyang wanted to ask him for a favor!

Yang Kai had already prepared himself; Qin Chaoyang had hinted at it before.

Now it seems… this favor might not be easy to grant.

After Qin Yu left, a moment later, Qin Chaoyang pushed the door open and entered.

“Sir Qin.” Yang Kai greeted him with a smile.

“Brother Yang.” Qin Chaoyang seemed preoccupied, absentmindedly saying, “Let’s sit and talk.”

After sitting down, Qin Chaoyang didn’t speak further, but instead frowned deeply, as if weighing words in his heart.

Seeing this, Yang Kai took the initiative to break the silence and said, “Sir Qin, judging by Miss Qin’s condition and aura… is there something wrong with her body?”

Qin Chaoyang sighed, “Yu’er’s health has never been good. Brother Yang, you must have noticed it long ago. Previously, I would spend my strength every day to stabilize her condition, but this time…”

“What exactly is wrong with Miss Qin’s body?” Yang Kai asked.

He instinctively felt that the favor Qin Chaoyang wanted to ask this time must be related to Qin Yu.

“Since you asked, I’ll speak plainly.” Qin Chaoyang gritted his teeth and said, “Yu’er is exceptionally gifted. She was born with the Fortune Heavenly Eye, a natural divine ability!”

“Fortune Heavenly Eye!” Yang Kai’s brows shot up.

“It’s a type of eye technique. As for its specific powers… Yu’er’s cultivation is too low and she’s still young, so I haven’t fully studied it. What she can do now seems to be seeing people’s fate, peering into the future, and discerning illusions…”

“That’s quite a useful divine ability.” Yang Kai was a bit surprised.

Yang Kai had long suspected that Qin Yu possessed an eye technique. This little girl had shown her innate divine ability in front of him more than once, but he hadn’t known its name or abilities. Only after Qin Chaoyang’s explanation did he understand.

“If it were only the Fortune Heavenly Eye, that would be fine. This divine ability doesn’t harm Yu’er much, it just puts some burden on her body each time she uses it. But Yu’er… not only has the Fortune Heavenly Eye, she also has the Heaven and Earth Severed Body!”

“Heaven and Earth Severed Body?” Yang Kai frowned.

Qin Chaoyang nodded, “When Yu’er was five, a great expert passed through Fenglin City, noticed her unusual constitution, investigated, and told me she bore the Heaven and Earth Severed Body.”

“What’s the downside of this Heaven and Earth Severed Body?”

Qin Chaoyang sighed, “The Heaven and Earth Severed Body is a special constitution. That expert said anyone with this body, as long as they remain in this world, will have their vitality severed by heaven and earth and won't live past eighteen!”

“Eighteen?” Yang Kai’s expression changed. He asked in shock, “May I ask how old Miss Yu is this year?”

“In another eight months… she’ll be eighteen.” Qin Chaoyang’s face was gloomy.

“Doesn’t that mean…” Yang Kai said in a low voice, “Miss Yu only has eight months left to live?”

“That’s right.” Qin Chaoyang nodded heavily.

Yang Kai was stunned.

Normally, someone born with a special constitution is favored by heaven and earth, but Qin Yu not only has a special constitution, she also possesses the Fortune Heavenly Eye, a divine ability that appears once in millions.

It’s just a pity… the Heaven and Earth Severed Body is not a good constitution, as it cuts off her vitality.

No wonder Qin Yu seemed weak earlier; her end was near.

She possesses the Fortune Heavenly Eye and can peer into the future… She might very well see her own end, but in front of others and alone, she never showed any panic.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai felt genuine admiration. Not everyone can face death so calmly.

“Sir Qin, you wanted to speak with me privately, it must be for Miss Qin, right? If there’s anything I can do to help, just say the word.” Yang Kai said seriously.

“Brother Yang, you really are willing to help?” Seeing Yang Kai bring it up himself, Qin Chaoyang was overjoyed.

“Although I haven’t interacted much with Miss Qin, she has helped me understand many things. I don’t want to see her die young.”

“Thank you, Brother Yang!” Qin Chaoyang suddenly stood up and bowed solemnly to Yang Kai.

“Sir Qin, there’s no need for this.” Yang Kai said with a wry smile.

Qin Chaoyang said, “Let me be clear, this favor isn’t easy to grant. Although it’s not a matter of certain death, it’s definitely not something easily accomplished. If you refuse, I will understand, and I absolutely won’t force you.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “It seems… it really is dangerous. Please, Sir Qin, tell me.”

Qin Chaoyang nodded and said, “Back then, that expert not only identified Yu’er’s constitution, but also told me the solution: to find a rare treasure of heaven and earth—the Calamity Fruit! As long as she takes this Calamity Fruit before she turns eighteen, she can safely survive the crisis. Afterward, not only will she grow up safely, but the true power of the Heaven and Earth Severed Body will also be unleashed, and her future will be smooth!”

“Calamity Fruit!” Yang Kai was startled.

“Brother Yang, you’ve heard of it?” Qin Chaoyang looked at him in surprise.

“I have.”

If it were Yang Kai a year ago, he might not have heard of such a thing. But ever since he obtained Gongsun Mu’s jade slip inheritance at the bottom of Primordial Cauldron Mountain, he had become thoroughly familiar with all the rare flowers and fruits of the Star Realm.

The Calamity Fruit was indeed recorded in the jade slip left by Gongsun Mu.

It is the main ingredient for refining a kind of pill called the Calamity Origin Pill, which is not really a good medicine—at best, it’s a kind of poison!

Colorless and tasteless, it dissolves easily in water. Even if an Emperor Realm expert accidentally ingests it, their Origin Qi will be completely frozen, turning them into a helpless lamb waiting for slaughter!

However… what Emperor Realm expert would drink water carelessly? So, although this pill is powerful, it’s basically useless.

The Calamity Origin Pill is a Poison Pill, and the raw material for making poison is, of course, extremely toxic itself.

That the Heaven and Earth Severed Body can only be resolved with such a poisonous fruit is truly a case of fighting poison with poison.

In this regard, Yang Kai was not in a position to comment, as he couldn’t be sure whether the Calamity Fruit would really help Qin Yu.

The Calamity Fruit grows in extremely cold places, perhaps beneath ten-thousand-year-old ice layers, and is exceedingly rare.

“I almost forgot, Brother Yang is also an Alchemist…” Qin Chaoyang seemed to remember something and smiled faintly.

Back then, when that expert told him to look for the Calamity Fruit, he had spent a lot of effort just to find out what it looked like and what it did. He didn’t expect Yang Kai to know it all at once.

“Since that expert said so… did he tell you where to find this fruit?” Yang Kai asked.

Qin Chaoyang lowered his voice, “The Land of Four Seasons!”

“What kind of place is that?”

Qin Chaoyang gave Yang Kai a strange look and said, “The Land of Four Seasons is the most famous secret realm in the entire Southern Territory. Every time it opens, all the major sects send countless elite disciples inside to seek heaven-and-earth treasures and various opportunities.”

Yang Kai’s face turned awkward. He realized he had shown his ignorance again and said, “Since it’s a secret realm shared by the Southern Territory, doesn’t that mean anyone can enter?”

Qin Chaoyang smiled bitterly, “If only it were so. But since ancient times, the Land of Four Seasons has been controlled by the great sects of the Southern Territory. Each sect has a set number of entry slots for their disciples. For a place like our Fenglin City, there’s no chance of entering at all.”

“Then what can be done?” Yang Kai frowned.

“With this!” As he spoke, Qin Chaoyang took out a token from his bosom.

When he produced the token, Qin Chaoyang’s face flushed slightly.

Yang Kai took it with a doubtful look. With just one glance his body jolted, and the corner of his mouth twitched as he said, “Old Brother Qin, where did you get this thing? Acting so unbefitting your age—does your Yu’er know about this?”
