## Chapter 662 — World-Ending Demon Eye

"Naturally." Li Rong nodded heavily. "We are not that bored."

"Who cares." Han Fei curled her lips.

Hua Mo laughed as well. "This old man has no such vile interests."

"Then you may enter." Yang Kai nodded, closed his eyes, and let his Divine Sense immerse in his Sea of Consciousness, transforming into a Spirit Body and releasing the Sea of Consciousness's defenses.

In the next moment he sensed three streams of energy surge into his Sea of Consciousness, and immediately the Spirit Bodies of the three chief leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan manifested before him.

For a moment everyone in the stone chamber fell silent. Guan'er sat pouting at the side, anxious as if a cat were clawing at her; she kept glancing here and there and couldn't help swinging a tiny fist at Yang Kai with a soft huff.

She also understood that whatever the three chiefs were about to discuss with this human must be confidential; with her status she had no qualification to intervene, so she dared not intrude into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness and could only sit outside and wait.

Within the Sea of Consciousness, a scalding aura wrapped around everything.

Whether Li Rong or Han Fei or Hua Mo, they could not help unleashing their Divine Sense power to fend off the heat, brows furrowing.

They, the Ancient Demon Clan, hated such a sensation above all else.

But Li Rong was more astonished: the last time she had been here, Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire had been nowhere near as strong as it was now, yet at this moment the heat pressed upon her and made her feel some strain.

She understood that after Yang Kai devoured those dozen or so other people's Divine Sense Fires, his own Divine Sense would surely have made great progress.

"Could you clear out an area so we can talk in peace?" Li Rong proposed.

Yang Kai thought for a moment, aware of what they were wary of, and pointed into the distance. "Go that way; there is no Divine Sense Fire there."

Following the direction of his finger, the three saw the Five-Colored Treasure Island standing amid the sea of fire.

Their eyes lit up and they flew with Yang Kai onto the island.

The moment a Spirit Body stepped onto that Five-Colored Treasure Island, the three leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan all showed a shock on their faces.

"How can my divine sense draw power from within your Sea of Consciousness?" Han Fei asked Yang Kai in astonishment.

"I can draw it too." Hua Mo likewise looked over, astonished.

"What is this Five-Colored Treasure Island?" Li Rong asked with obvious interest and a smile. She could naturally feel that the reason the three could draw Divine Sense strength inside Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness was entirely due to this treasure island.

"Isn't that what this visit is about?" Yang Kai's expression was indifferent; he had no intention of solving their curiosity for them.

The Warm Spirit Lotus constantly nourished the spirit; whenever they set foot here they would certainly gain some benefit, albeit very slight.

But as the owner of the Warm Spirit Lotus, Yang Kai was different — over years and years those tiny amounts of power would accumulate into a quantity that stirred envy in others.

"I spoke out of turn." Li Rong lightly nodded. "But I noticed you have many fine things about you."

"Every man has his secrets." Yang Kai said coldly. "It's time I understood. I'm curious about your attitude toward me; I suppose Hua Mo and Han Fei are as well."

Hearing him, Hua Mo and Han Fei quickly turned their gazes to Li Rong.

Li Rong pursed her lips in a smile, extended a slender jade hand, and pointed to the sky. "Look that way."

Following the direction of her finger, Hua Mo and Han Fei concentrated and looked.

In the sky a single closed eye floated; the instant they beheld it, Hua Mo and Han Fei could not help but feel terror and a compulsion to kneel in worship welling up from their hearts.

For reasons unknown, their Spirit Bodies even began to tremble.

"Can you make it open like last time?" Li Rong turned to Yang Kai and asked.

Yang Kai slightly nodded and sent his intention.

The closed single eye slowly opened; a narrow, majestic golden pupil greeted the three, as if some supreme, aloof sovereign were looking down with disdain.

Under such a gaze, no one could help feeling utterly insignificant, as if merely being looked upon would reduce them to dust and wipe them from the world.

Hua Mo and Han Fei trembled even more violently; even Li Rong's delicate form could not help a gentle shiver.

"You… should know what this is, right?" Li Rong's face was excited; she panted as she asked, her gaze hazy upon that single eye, unable to look away even though she was pained inside and felt the urge to kneel in worship.

"World-Ending Demon Eye?" Hua Mo suddenly cried out after a dozen breaths of silence.

Han Fei trembled and her expression turned as excited as Li Rong's; she asked urgently, "Is this really the World-Ending Demon Eye?"

"No doubt about it; it matches exactly what the records left by our ancestors describe, and it struck me with a beam of golden light last time — I can feel that destructive power; there is no other explanation besides the World-Ending Demon Eye." Li Rong's intense agitation revealed how unsettled she was within.

"Heavens have eyes — in my lifetime I still got to see the World-Ending Demon Eye!" Hua Mo burst into tears and knelt with a thud, worshiping that single eye in the sky.

Immediately, Li Rong and Han Fei also performed the same ritual.

Yang Kai's expression was strange; he stared blankly, speechless for a time.

Suddenly, three beams of golden light shot from that single eye, striking precisely at the three Spirit Bodies.

Yang Kai's face changed, but he quickly steadied himself.

After being bathed in those golden beams, the three not only did not vanish nor suffer harm, but instead looked ecstatic, closing their eyes as if enlightened, wearing expressions of bliss.

Yang Kai watched secretly, knowing they must have received something from that golden light, and did not interrupt, waiting quietly at the side.

The Golden Pupil Eye slowly closed.

After a long wait, the three leaders opened their eyes one by one, and at that moment Yang Kai clearly sensed that their Spirit Bodies were much stronger than before.

It seemed they had received considerable benefit.

Yang Kai pondered; by now he also knew the Golden Pupil Eye must have a deep connection with the Ancient Demon Clan, though he still did not understand the exact nature of their relationship.

The three, sensing their change, were joyful and excited; they looked at one another, then bowed respectfully to Yang Kai, clasping their fists. "We pay our respects to Lord!"

Yang Kai frowned and forced a smile. "Hey, what is this about? Aren't you all making a mistake?"

"No mistake. From today on, you shall be the leader of our Ancient Demon Clan!" Li Rong's eyes burned as she looked at Yang Kai.

Surprisingly, Hua Mo and Han Fei did not protest; instead they nodded in solemn agreement.

"You must be joking." Yang Kai's frown deepened. "I am human and you are demons; our bloodlines are utterly different. How could I be the leader of your Ancient Demon Clan?"

"My lord, please be calm; I will explain in detail." Li Rong smiled slightly and pointed to the sky. "May I ask where you acquired this World-Ending Demon Eye?"

Yang Kai considered and shook his head. "It's inconvenient to say."

Although he could have fabricated a reason, playing such tricks before three Saint Realm cultivators would be childish; they were sincere toward him, and Yang Kai felt embarrassed to deceive them.

"Then I shall not press." Li Rong did not care, lightly smiling. "It is natural you remain suspicious of us now. If you had disclosed everything so readily, we would have to consider whether to entrust the Ancient Demon Clan to someone so guileless. Your conduct proves you are worthy of the Great Demon God's choice!"

"The Great Demon God?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "What does he have to do with this?"

"Because the World-Ending Demon Eye is the Great Demon God's eye!" Li Rong replied.

Yang Kai was stunned on the spot.

"My lord, you have lived in Mo Shen Fort for over a year; you must have heard many rumors about the Great Demon God."

Yang Kai nodded slightly. On the way back from the volcano, Li Rong had mentioned more about the Great Demon God; she had not spoken casually, but had deliberately tried to let him learn more of that powerful being.

"That makes my explanation easier." Li Rong inhaled gently. "The Great Demon God had a world-shaking might; on the entire Tongxuan Continent, among recorded strong ones, none could match him. In his age, the demons were the foremost race and all others were their vassals. Among the demon clans, our Ancient Demon Clan had the noblest bloodline and served the Great Demon God as his attendants."

As Li Rong spoke, pride filled her face; even Han Fei and Hua Mo showed wistful expressions recalling the past.

"The Great Demon God's cultivation was overwhelmingly powerful; there was no rival. Because he had no opponent, he sought to break free of this world to see if higher planes existed. Records say he succeeded and left for a place unknown to us. Other records say he failed and his soul was burned; since his last appearance no one knows where he went."

"Now it seems the Great Demon God indeed failed, otherwise he would not have left behind the World-Ending Demon Eye!" Li Rong's face showed some sorrow. "Before he left, he sealed our clan within this Small Xuan Realm, for he knew that once he departed the demons would weaken and other races might rebel, and as his loyal servants we would face extinction. That is why our clan dwells in this Small Xuan Realm. The Great Demon God did not intend to imprison us forever; he left a way to resolve it, so that when we finally leave this place, the world may have forgotten the Ancient Demon Clan and the faithful servants who served the Great Demon God."

"Though the Great Demon God is gone, even one of his eyes would not be lightly obtained by anyone. That you possess the World-Ending Demon Eye means the Great Demon God has accepted you. If the Great Demon God accepts you, then as his servants the Ancient Demon Clan will accept you as well! So from now on you are the master of our Ancient Demon Clan. We shall serve you as our ancestors served the Great Demon God; you must be the one sent by the Great Demon God to rescue our clan from this world!" Li Rong said with solemn gravity.
