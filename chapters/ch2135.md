## Chapter 2135 — If You Have Guts, Hit Me

"So he's a disciple of Qingyang Shrine?" Lan Xun saw Yang Kai standing with the group from Qingyang Shrine and naturally assumed so.

"Princess, what did you say?" Xiao Chen asked.

"It's nothing." Lan Xun shook her head.

Xiao Chen frowned slightly. Although he was displeased that Lan Xun was unwilling to share anything with him, she was, after all, the daughter of the Radiant Moon Great Emperor and of noble status, so he could not press her. He followed her gaze, and when he saw Yang Kai he snorted inwardly, "Such a minor character—what could possibly interest the Princess?"

On the other side, after killing the small-family disciple, Wuchang looked utterly indifferent, as if he'd squashed a cockroach, then turned his attention back to Xia Sheng.

Xia Sheng said, "Brother Wuchang, what an impressive display!"

Wuchang sneered coldly, saying nothing.

"I don't care about others living or dying, but... as for attacking my Junior Sister, shouldn't Brother Wuchang give me a reasonable explanation?" Xia Sheng narrowed his eyes at the man before him.

Wuchang said, "Brother Xia wants an explanation? Fine... My explanation is—no one can fly over my head, except the dead!"

Xia Sheng was taken aback, unable to believe that such a ridiculous reason had led him to attack Murong Xiaoxiao.

Murong Xiaoxiao had also come to her senses by now, pursing her lips and saying, "I just wanted to go over to Star God Palace..."

She had an acquaintance at Star God Palace whom she had not seen in a long time. Now that she was here, she naturally wanted to catch up, but just as she took off, Wuchang attacked her, frightening her into landing again.

Wuchang said, "Brother Xia should be glad she's from Qingyang Shrine, otherwise..."

"Otherwise what?"

"Otherwise, she'd already be dead!"

"Is that so..." Xia Sheng grinned. Suddenly, he did something no one expected.

He leapt up, streaking over Wuchang's head like a gust of wind, then turned and flew back. After a moment, he turned again and flew over Wuchang's head once more.

As he flew, he shouted, "I flew over! Now I'm flying back! I flew over again! Now I'm flying back! If you have guts, hit me!"

After several passes he hovered directly above Wuchang's head, hands on his hips, looking down arrogantly. "Do you believe I'll piss on your head?" he taunted.

Then he actually pulled his pants up, as if ready to do it...

Murong Xiaoxiao and several other female disciples from Qingyang Shrine blushed at the sight.

Xiao Baiyi and the others were even more embarrassed, turning their heads away as if they did not know him.

"Hahaha!" The crowd burst into laughter, finding Xia Sheng's antics far too childish and amusing—hardly the behavior of a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

"Xia... Sheng!"

With Wuchang's moody and violent temperament, how could he tolerate such provocation? So as Xia Sheng lifted his pants, he let out a low roar. His arms shook violently, and a force like a tornado shot skyward, trying to swallow Xia Sheng whole.

"Petty tricks!" Xia Sheng snorted, flipping his hand and striking downward with his palm.

Origin Qi surged; the laws of heaven and earth went chaotic, and a gigantic palm print formed like a mountain falling from the sky—even before it struck it radiated annihilation.

Boom—

The giant palm and the tornado collided, and heaven-and-earth energy erupted in all directions.

In that instant, Wuchang leapt up, hands pressed together—one fiery red, one snowy white. Two completely different auras surged forth, and as his technique changed, complex runes flickered at his side.

With thunderous momentum, he charged at Xia Sheng.

Xia Sheng's face grew serious. His hand seals changed, and the sound of metal clashing rang out in the void. Suddenly, all kinds of weapons appeared at his side, each one formed from heaven-and-earth energy, countless and varied.

With a wave of his hand, the countless weapons seemed to receive a command and slashed downward together.

Boom boom boom—

Even louder explosions rang out, and the dazzling light swallowed both Xia Sheng and Wuchang, making it impossible to see their figures. All anyone could hear in the chaotic void was the sound of energy bursting and fists and feet colliding.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, staring intently at the battle above, utterly captivated.

This was a clash between the top rising stars of the two greatest sects in the Southern Territory—a contest that could represent the highest level in the entire Southern Territory. Such a battle was a rare sight for him.

Not only could he compare his own shortcomings to theirs, he could also gather some intelligence.

"Senior Brother Xia... he'll be alright, won't he?" Murong Xiaoxiao looked guilty; if she hadn't accidentally flown over Wuchang's head, none of this trouble would have happened.

"How could anything happen to him!" Xiao Baiyi snorted, seemingly unconcerned for Xia Sheng's safety. He said coolly, "Even if an ordinary Emperor Realm expert attacked him, he'd still have a chance to escape. What could Wuchang possibly do to him?"

Yang Kai's heart stirred at these words.

Clearly, Xiao Baiyi knew some of Xia Sheng's secrets, but he did not elaborate, and Yang Kai naturally did not ask.

Judging by his tone, Xia Sheng's true strength was far greater than it appeared, and of course... Wuchang probably wasn't fighting at full power either.

"Childish!" In a remote corner of the valley, at the camp of the Eight Directions Sect, a young man sitting cross-legged watched the battle in the sky for a while and commented disdainfully.

Although the Eight Directions Sect was not a top sect in the Southern Territory, it was decent, on par with Fei Sheng Palace, and had an Emperor Realm expert overseeing it.

So this time, when the Four Seasons Land opened, Eight Directions Tower was lucky enough to receive seven spots to enter.

Of the seven, their cultivation varied—some were Third Stage Dao Origin Realm, others Second or First Stage.

The young man who spoke was only at the Second Stage, but judging by the others' attitudes, he seemed to be their leader.

The only Third Stage Dao Origin Realm was a middle-aged man of about forty. He smiled and said, "Junior Brother Luo Yuan, do you think such a contest is beneath you?"

Luo Yuan said, "They're just probing each other. What's there to see?"

"This is just probing?" Another Second Stage Dao Origin Realm woman exclaimed, "It looks to me like they're trying to kill each other!"

"That's because your cultivation isn't high enough." Luo Yuan said bluntly, not caring about his fellow disciples' feelings.

The woman was left speechless and could only laugh awkwardly.

The middle-aged man said, "Junior Brother Luo Yuan truly has sharp eyes. This time in the Four Seasons Land, we'll all be relying on you."

Luo Yuan frowned and said, "Don't worry. This time in the Four Seasons Land, I'll make sure Eight Directions Sect becomes famous throughout the Southern Territory. But... I have no interest in dragging you lot along. Once we're inside, don't come looking for me, or don't blame me for being rude!"

The others saw how arrogant he was, but dared not show their anger, and even seemed a little afraid of him.

The middle-aged man said, "Of course we won't hold you back, Junior Brother. Do as you please when the time comes."

"Hmph!" Luo Yuan snorted and closed his eyes, saying no more.

The others looked at each other, all feeling frustrated.

They were all Dao Origin Realm cultivators, not weak, but being called trash to their faces was hard to accept. Still, knowing Luo Yuan's temperament, none dared argue.

The skirmish in the air continued.

Xia Sheng and Wuchang were evenly matched; neither could seize the advantage, and the void around them warped as the laws of heaven and earth twisted.

"Enough!"

Suddenly, a voice filled with authority rang out. As soon as it sounded, Xia Sheng and Wuchang, who had been fighting, froze in midair as if struck by lightning, their faces turning pale and cold sweat pouring down their foreheads.

Two beams of light flashed, appearing beneath their feet.

Then, the light suddenly spread out like spider silk, instantly forming two cage-like structures that trapped Xia Sheng and Wuchang in midair.

The voice sounded again: "Xia Sheng of Qingyang Shrine, Wuchang of Tianwu Sacred Land, you have fought without permission. This Lord will confine you until the secret realm opens. Let this be a warning to all!"

Xia Sheng's face turned green at these words, and he quickly said, "Lord Xiao, this disciple is innocent!"

He immediately recognized the voice as that of Star Envoy Xiao Yuyang from Star God Palace, so he hurried to beg for mercy.

Xiao Yuyang paid him no mind.

On the other side, Wuchang, also trapped in midair, glanced at him and snorted, "Spineless!"

"None of your business!" Xia Sheng shot him a look and then pleaded, "Lord Xiao, please be fair! I follow the rules—only provocation drove me to this. Lord Xiao, please let me down..."

After pleading and finding it useless, he changed tack: "Fine, confine me if you must, but could you at least set me down? Being trapped in midair is humiliating!"

"Can you shut up?" Wuchang hadn't minded at first—after all, being punished by a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert was only natural. But with Xia Sheng carrying on, he suddenly felt... being stared at by so many people was indeed embarrassing, and he grew annoyed.

Xia Sheng glanced at him and said, "What? Am I bothering you?"

"Noisy!" Wuchang snorted.

"You still dare to yap?" Xia Sheng snapped, lifting his pants. "Believe it or not, even like this I could piss right in your face—the wind's in my favor!"

Wuchang's mouth twitched violently at these words. He took a deep breath and wisely closed his eyes.

If others want to be shameless, he cannot stoop to their level.

He left a harsh parting shot: "We'll settle this inside the secret realm!"
