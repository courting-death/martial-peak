## Chapter 1208 — Nothing Good

Warriors born of the Battle Sky Alliance are easy to spot from their dress; each wears a gilded long robe that makes them appear arrogantly invincible.

These fighters all carried an air of superiority; apart from casting a somewhat respectful glance at warriors from the Leitai Sect, when they looked at members of other powers they regarded them with pure contempt, regardless of the other's cultivation.

As if being part of the Battle Sky Alliance were something extraordinary — these people seemed afraid others wouldn’t know their origin. The gold-thread “Battle” character embroidered on their chests could be seen clearly even from afar.

Because of Qu Changfeng, Yang Kai had long disliked members of the Battle Sky Alliance, so when he saw that these four were from that Alliance he knew nothing good would come of today; his earlier appropriation of a Flowing Flame Fireblaze had probably been witnessed by them.

He did not know how much they'd seen.

In an instant the four Battle Sky Alliance men had rushed to a short distance in front of Yang Kai, sizing him up with expressions ranging from surprise to delight.

One had to admit the Battle Sky Alliance was well founded: all four were cultivators of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, their Saint Yuan purer and more vigorous than that of ordinary fighters, and faint blue light curtains shimmered around them — those curtains radiated chill, clearly the work of cold-attribute Secret Treasures, shielding them from this place's fire-poison.

The leader, a pale-faced, clean-shaven man of some forty years, couldn't help but raise an eyebrow when he probed Yang Kai's true cultivation, his expression one of utter astonishment.

He could not fathom how a First Stage of the Saint King Realm like Yang Kai could survive in such hostile conditions. Moreover, from Yang Kai's bearing it did not seem that Secret Treasures were protecting him, which caused the man to feel a jolt and regard Yang Kai with a slightly grave look.

Anyone able to withstand the heat and fire-poison here without Secret Treasures, relying solely on Saint Yuan, was not to be taken lightly.

"Did he just absorb a Flowing Flame Fireblaze?" the thin man cried out, eyes wide with surprise.

It seemed they had been too far away earlier to see clearly and only suspected, which was why they had hurried over to verify.

“That can’t be right. Flowing Flame Fireblazes aren’t something you can just collect at will. Sure, there are more of them on the Third Layer, but even Fang Tianzhong couldn’t catch one—what makes you think he can?” The third cultivator, a sharp-faced man with monkey-like features, slowly shook his head, looking utterly unconvinced.

"Well, ask him and find out," the thin man chuckled, then carelessly called to Yang Kai, "Kid, what did you pick up earlier? Hand it over and let us see."

“What’s it to you?” Yang Kai looked at the four of them calmly, without the slightest hint of fear or thought of escape.

The thin man laughed on hearing this, nodding repeatedly. "Heh. It may not concern us, but kid, do you know who we are? How dare you speak to us like that — amusing."

Saying this, his expression darkened and he spoke coldly, "Kid, if you want to live, hand over what you just took; if I'm in a good mood I'll let you live — otherwise..." He chuckled menacingly.

The laugh dripped with threat.

The pale, clean-shaven leader, who had been studying Yang Kai, frowned at the words for a moment before relaxing; though he could tell Yang Kai was not ordinary and his calm was odd, the man was after all just one person, and he did not believe the four of them would be helpless against him.

There were always those who thought themselves grand after gaining a little skill; he'd seen many of them, for he had once been one of them, but after suffering repeated humiliation at Qu Changfeng's hands he had learned that there were always greater peaks beyond one's own.

He instinctively lumped Yang Kai into that sort of person.

Such people were destined to suffer heavy losses.

He'd been lucky — being from the same Sect as Qu Changfeng had kept him from being killed — but after learning his lesson, he'd become far more low-key in his behavior.

“You think I’ll just hand it over because you asked? What do you take yourself for?” Yang Kai looked at the four men coldly, his expression still indifferent.

“Brat, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!” The thin man hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so defiant, and his face instantly darkened in embarrassment.

He'd used this trick before to intimidate others; which cultivator hadn't complied? Even when he'd set his eyes on a certain man's woman, the man had obediently handed over that beauty, and though he'd only toyed with her for a few days before discarding her, no one had ever dared refuse his demand.

All because he was from the Battle Sky Alliance!

Let alone outside, this place was the Flowing Flame Sandland — desolate, remote; the perfect spot to kill someone and bury the body. At the thought, a cold light flashed in the man's eyes, and murderous intent showed.

"Wait!" Before he could move, the pale, clean-shaven middle-aged man suddenly called him back.

The others looked toward him, and the man stepped forward a few paces, focused his gaze on Yang Kai and slightly cupped his hands, "Friend, my Junior Brother has a hot temper; if he offended you just now, please don't take it to heart."

Yang Kai's eyes flickered but he remained unmoved.

"Senior Brother..." the thin man, shocked that his senior would apologize to Yang Kai, exclaimed, "You're being overly cautious — why bother with him?"

The middle-aged man smiled faintly. "Better safe than sorry. Our master taught us caution: carefulness steers a ten-thousand-year ship. This friend is not ordinary; although I can't discern his origins, someone who can remain unscathed here must have some skill. It's best if we can resolve this peacefully."

The implication being that if they couldn't settle it peacefully, they'd resort to force later.

The thin man's face darkened as he thought it over, and he ceased his bluster.

Only then did the middle-aged man turn to Yang Kai with a smile and continue, "Friend, we don't wish to make trouble; after all, this is the Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland — anyone here is on edge. Could you do me a favor and allow my Junior Brother to inspect your Spatial Ring?"

He wore a friendly smile, as if asking to borrow a trivial trinket from an old acquaintance rather than demanding to check Yang Kai's Spatial Ring.

"You want to inspect my Spatial Ring?" Yang Kai suddenly grinned.

"Exactly!" the middle-aged man nodded lightly, his smile like spring. "We have no malice — we only want to confirm what you picked up earlier. If it's not a Flowing Flame Fireblaze, we won't covet your possessions and will return the Spatial Ring. What say you?"

"Fine!" To the man's surprise Yang Kai agreed at once, causing his brow to lift; he inwardly wondered if he had been overly cautious — perhaps the fellow had no real skill, which was why he'd been so agreeable.

As the man hesitated, Yang Kai actually slipped the Spatial Ring from his finger and tossed it lightly; the four pairs of eyes followed the ordinary ring up and down.

"Throw it here!" The thin man, seeing Yang Kai so cooperative, shouted, eager to inspect it closely.

"There's nothing of value in my Spatial Ring," Yang Kai said with a rueful smile, his tone faintly miserly. "Just a Fire-Glow Crystal Core..."

Yang Kai produced a head-sized, blood-red stone; a scorching, pure flame power emanated from it, and flames of almost tangible energy swirled across the rock as if it were alive.

"A Fire-Glow Crystal Core?" the four cried in unison; even the middle-aged man who'd been smiling calmly could no longer hide his changed expression, his eyes filled with greed and longing.

The Fire-Glow Crystal Core was a Void King-Grade material, and though the one in Yang Kai’s hand was only of the lower tier, its sheer size made it extraordinary. A piece that large—nearly as big as a human head—was something not only had the four never seen before, they hadn’t even heard of its like.

If such a material were sold outside, it would be worth a fortune — easily fetching tens of millions of Saint Crystal.

They had heard rumors of treasures selling for tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of Saint Crystal at the Jubao Tower auction in Tianyun City, but they had never qualified to attend and had never witnessed such scenes; it had always been a regret. Now such a top-grade refining material stood before them.

And it was in the hands of a First Stage of the Saint King Realm!

If his senior and fellow disciples could obtain this treasure, even split evenly among them, each would get several million Saint Crystals — enough to never worry about cultivation resources for the rest of their lives.

For a moment their breathing quickened and their eyes shone with predatory light; the middle-aged man's earlier claim of not coveting Yang Kai's goods was long discarded.

But before they could move, Yang Kai stored the head-sized Fire-Glow Crystal Core into his Spatial Ring, leaving the four angry and disappointed.

"Ah, and there's this Fire Crystal Stone too — nothing special," Yang Kai sighed, as if oblivious to keeping wealth hidden, and produced a dark-red crystal the size of a millstone.

Though this crystal emitted the same scorching fire-power as the Fire-Glow Crystal Core, the two materials were clearly different.

The former was a mineral ore, while the latter's energy signature resembled the Crystal Stones the four Battle Sky Alliance men had gathered on their journey.

"Impossible!" the thin man screamed, pointing at the huge Crystal Stone cradled in Yang Kai's arms, shaking his head. "There's no way there's a Crystal Stone this big — no fire spirit beast would have such a thing in its body!"

It wasn't that he lacked knowledge; after all, the largest Crystal Stone these four had obtained on their trip had only been the size of a pigeon egg, making Yang Kai's look utterly disproportionate, like a towering tree beside a sapling.

Besides, if this truly were a Crystal Stone, what level of fire spirit beast would contain it? What enormous body would that beast possess?

He couldn't believe Yang Kai could have slain such a creature — he assumed Yang Kai was bluffing.
