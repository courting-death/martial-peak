## Chapter 649 — The Mystery of the Demon Mark

Upon seeing Li Rong appear, Guan'er hurriedly saluted.

The beautiful woman gave a slight wave, signifying there was no need to mind it, then walked up to Yang Kai and looked at him with a helpless expression.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Repaid grievances are only fair, repaid enmity likewise — it's only natural. Your clansfolk getting so worked up is to be expected."

"You're not afraid at all?" Li Rong asked in astonishment; she could not detect a trace of fear on Yang Kai's face.

"Afraid of what?" Yang Kai looked calm. "If Lady Li weren't planning to intervene, you wouldn't have shown yourself before me. Since you have appeared, that means you'll handle it. I'm naturally not afraid, because Lady Li, you seem to favor me especially!"

Li Rong's expression abruptly turned a little awkward, and Guan'er couldn't help but cover her small mouth, staring at Yang Kai in a silly way.

No one had ever dared speak such a flippant remark in front of Lady Li, yet this reckless human brat said it outright. Not only did he not anger Lady Li, she even looked as if she accepted it.

"May I ask why that is? What special quality do I have that would make Lady Li so concerned?" Yang Kai tilted his head and looked leisurely at the elegant woman before him.

Li Rong cleared her throat lightly. "Anyone sent in by a senior Coffin-Servant, I will not mistreat, because perhaps one day this person will help my clan out of a predicament."

That remark was a bit self-deluding — even Guan'er noticed it, and Yang Kai certainly did too.

But Li Rong would not state the reason outright, and Yang Kai did not pry into it. Thinking it over, it was after Li Rong had seen the Golden Pupil Eye in his Sea of Consciousness that her attitude toward him had changed.

Previously she had been somewhat friendly, but their relationship was merely cooperative; now it was different. From the way she cared for him in so many ways, it was plain she paid him considerable attention.

Yang Kai was not foolish enough to believe such a dignified, graceful noblewoman had fallen in love with him — she was a Saint Realm expert who had lived untold years; love to her was likely but a passing smoke. The other explanation Yang Kai allowed himself was the effect brought by the Golden Pupil Eye.

He could not understand why the Golden Pupil Eye would cause her to change.

"You're not wrong," Li Rong said. "Since I have shown myself, I will handle this matter. Do not worry too much. I have already had people restrain my clansfolk; they will not trouble you. But remember, do not cause conflicts with my people for no reason in the future. I can protect you once, but that does not mean I will tolerate your presumptuousness!"

"I would never provoke trouble on my own." Yang Kai gave a short laugh. The noblewoman seemed to be covering her earlier lapse, and her tone grew noticeably colder.

"That would be best." Li Rong inclined her head slightly, spoke no more, then turned and walked toward the outside, opening the stone door.

After a moment, Yang Kai heard Li Rong admonishing those of the Ancient Demon Clan outside; soon the demon folk gathered outside the stone chamber scattered like birds and beasts and retreated.

Guan'er stuck out her delicate tongue at Yang Kai and said admiringly, "You do have some skill, but your arrogance doesn't match your present strength. Wait until you ascend to the Transcendent Realm — then you can be as presumptuous as you like, heh heh…"

With a coquettish laugh, Guan'er departed.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head; now that he was under someone else's roof, he felt a measure of bewilderment.

He knew that in this ghostly place, aside from the few who treated him tolerably, the rest regarded him as an alien species; without someone to shelter him, he would sooner or later die.

This time Pan Lang had come to make trouble and he had managed; but what if next time it were a Transcendent Realm expert? Or the time after that a Saint Realm powerhouse?

That was why Yang Kai had spoken plainly and revealed Lady Li's attitude: to secure a little protection and to confirm whether his observation was correct.

Fortunately, his suspicions were right. Although Li Rong tried her best to conceal it, Yang Kai still saw clearly that she did indeed look after him.

Regardless of whether she harbored ulterior motives, Yang Kai had to use her status and position to guarantee his own safety.

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai scratched his head and suddenly remembered he had forgotten to ask about the Demon Mark.

This matter had been on his mind for months. Ever since he first saw the patterns on the Ancient Demon Clan members, he had been curious, but being unfamiliar with the place he had not dared ask, for fear of inviting trouble.

Now that Li Rong showed herself to favor him, he could investigate the matter.

Yang Kai was very interested in the Ancient Demon Clan's Demon Marks because when he entered the Demonic State, similar changes occurred in him, only far more pronounced than with Pan Lang and the others.

He would wait for Guan'er to come again and find an opportunity to ask.

Decided, Yang Kai turned and went to the alchemical furnaces to continue improving his pillcraft.

..........

Li Rong left the stone chamber, and after dismissing those who had wanted to make trouble for Yang Kai, a trace of confusion could not help but show on her pretty face.

The day she had seen the Golden Pupil Eye, the golden light that shone from the eye seemed to awaken a resonance in the bloodline of the Ancient Demon Clan. After returning, she specially consulted the records and found that what the texts described largely matched what she had observed.

It was for this reason that Li Rong had changed her attitude toward Yang Kai.

But over these past months of covert observation she had found the matter to be not quite as she had imagined. Although this human was strange and powerful, he was far from the level she had expected.

Whether he truly was what she suspected, Li Rong could not decide.

Just then someone reported that the two great commanders Hua Mo and Han Fei had come together and brought a large quantity of medicinal herbs.

Li Rong's expression brightened and she hurried toward the main hall.

Yang Kai's pill refinement consumed an incalculable number of medicinal materials, and Mo Shen Fort's stores were becoming insufficient. Fortunately, the other commanders' territories had accumulated many herbs over the years; Hua Mo and Han Fei had their people scour the lands and today brought them all at once.

Upon seeing Hua Mo and Han Fei and receiving the herbs, the three of them sat down as usual to chat idly.

"Lady Li, did Chu Jian send any medicinal materials?" Hua Mo asked.

"He sent some, but very little. Chu Jian says his lands are barren and produce few herbs; over the years he has only gathered so little," Li Rong said, rubbing her forehead.

"What a bold-faced lie," Hua Mo snorted. "Chu Jian has a mountain range—how could he have no herbs? He's increasingly failing to show you proper regard."

Han Fei said icily, "He doesn't consider our clan's future; he's set only on ruling this Small Xuan Realm. How ignorant and foolish!"

The two commanders took turns airing Chu Jian's faults, both demanding Li Rong teach him a lesson so he would behave himself.

As ever, Li Rong simply listened in silence and showed no intention of voicing an opinion.

Hua Mo and Han Fei's words carried little weight, so they did not press the matter further.

"By the way, Lady Li, I just heard that human brat caused some trouble?" Hua Mo suddenly asked. "Lady Li, you are usually fair in your dealings — why this time do you side with an outsider?"

Han Fei looked at Li Rong with some surprise. Regardless of the cause of the clash between Yang Kai and Pan Lang, if their people had suffered a loss, an outsider should pay the price; yet what they had heard was not so.

Li Rong gave a light laugh. "You're rather well informed."

Hua Mo replied, "The people in the fort are all talking about it; it's hard not to hear."

Han Fei's face turned stern. "Lady Li, because of this matter many people harbor grievances against you. Is this really worth it?"

Li Rong's expression also turned serious. After a moment's thought she said, "If my guess is correct, then it is worth it."

"What guess?" Hua Mo asked, puzzled.

"It's hard to say now — I'm still observing. If you could see what I have seen, you would surely make the same choice. When the truth is revealed, I will tell you."

Hua Mo and Han Fei both nodded slightly. Over the years they had come to trust Li Rong's sight and judgment; since she chose to favor an outsider, she must have her reasons.

The three spoke a while longer, after which Hua Mo and Han Fei took their leave.

Although all were of Mo Shen Fort and all commanders, their four great branches occupied different locations, so Hua Mo and Han Fei had to return to their own territories.

This time their main purpose had been to transport the medicinal materials.

..........

After that incident in which Pan Lang's provocation backfired and he was beaten, the Ancient Demon Clan's attitude toward Yang Kai grew increasingly worse. Yang Kai no longer bothered to stir up trouble; he remained daily in the stone chamber among pills and herbs. His alchemy advanced rapidly, and each day he could refine a great many pills, consuming an incalculable amount of materials.

Yang Kai could sense that a top-tier expert was secretly guarding him outside the stone chamber. The man's concealment was nearly perfect, but after years of experience Yang Kai had still managed to trace him.

That person should have been sent by Li Rong to guard him.

Realizing this, Yang Kai felt considerably more at ease.

His relationship with Guan'er was also harmonious. The demon maiden was very curious about the outside world; whenever Yang Kai had free time she would pester him to tell stories of the outside, and the splendor and beauty he described greatly tempted her.

She also strongly supported his alchemy, hoping that one day Yang Kai could refine Saint-Grade pills and bring salvation to their people.

Yang Kai also learned about the Demon Mark from Guan'er.

According to Guan'er, their Ancient Demon Clan possessed an exceptionally pure and noble bloodline, incomparable to other demon folk. Their Demon Marks were innate, yet could be cultivated after birth to grow stronger. When a Demon Mark was employed in battle, the user's strength would increase; the more comprehensively the mark unfolded, the greater the enhancement.

Those like Pan Lang could unfold their Demon Mark a second time; Guan'er could as well, and Yang Kai had seen with his own eyes how her cultivation rose after she displayed her Demon Mark.

Guan'er, only at Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage, after unfolding her Demon Mark a second time, had inner strength and Qi and blood sufficient to rival peak Divine Roaming experts.
