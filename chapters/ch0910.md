## Chapter 910 — Soul Incarnation

Lei Long snorted, "Kid, what do you take me for? Do you think I'm the sort of despicable man who kicks others when they're down? Great Lord Blood Jiao did fall because of Meng Wuya, and I did intend to test him, but I would wait until he returned to his peak—provided, of course, that you can actually rescue him."

To have trapped someone like Meng Wuya, the mysteries contained within those eight stone pillars had to be extraordinary; Great Lord Lei Long didn't put much stock in Yang Kai's boastful words.

This brat could surprise people time and again, but his cultivation was, after all, only the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

"Whether he can be saved or not, I have to try." Yang Kai inhaled deeply and his Divine Sense spread like a tide, extending toward the eight stone pillars.

He was new to the place and had no idea what danger Shopkeeper Meng had fallen into, or why he was bound to the pillars, so he must investigate first.

He moved with utmost caution, careful not to touch any seals or forbidden formations.

Sensing Yang Kai's Divine Sense creeping in, the trapped Meng Wuya weakly shook his head; his parched lips twitched as if to stop Yang Kai, his eyes filled with urgent anxiety.

He had also been investigating when he was inexplicably trapped.

But Yang Kai's Divine Sense was swift and silent; Meng Wuya had no time to intervene.

The instant his Divine Sense touched the eight stone pillars, Yang Kai's face drained of color.

The terrifying power hidden in those pillars far exceeded his imagination; it was almost a force capable of sweeping the very world away.

In the next moment, heaven and earth trembled as a pressure descended that chilled everyone with horror.

All five Saint Realm experts felt their qi and blood roil and their breaths catch.

They had never expected such a dreadful pressure to exist in the world—one even they dared not resist.

Golden light flared; out of the void a massive hand loomed and, in a flash, seized Yang Kai's body.

Immediately the golden fingers contracted into a rope, binding Yang Kai and dragging him forward.

Yang Kai could not resist; his strength was almost completely sealed before that hand-turned-rope, unable to manifest even an ounce.

Looking around in terror, every expert who had arrived—one and all—found they could not escape; all were being drawn toward the octagonal pillars—they had all probed with their Divine Sense.

Only Xia Ningshang, who lay unconscious where she was, luckily escaped the fate.

Seeing this, Meng Wuya's eyes dimmed; he knew it was already too late.

Thud... thud...

The four yao, together with Li Rong and Yang Kai—six in total—were bound to the pillars, unable to move.

In the next moment, appalling screams rose one after another.

Even the two Great Yao Lords, powerful as they were, could not bear the sudden, horrific torment; their faces twisted in pain. Caidie and Li Rong screamed hoarsely.

A feral power erupted from everyone; the four yao all transformed into their demonic beast forms, trying to burst free from the pillars' bindings.

Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon, Earth-Splitting Divine Ox, Nine-Nether Golden Ni Beast, and the Seven-Colored Illusion Butterfly—each demonic beast bore a noble yao bloodline, rare to behold, and now they were gathered together.

Li Rong also unleashed the Demon God Transformation; eerie, pitch-black demon marks crawled across her cheeks, giving her a wild, feral beauty.

But no matter how they struggled, in the face of those eight stone pillars they were as weak as ants.

Yang Kai's face turned deathly pale.

The moment he was bound to the pillar he finally understood the pain Meng Wuya had been suffering.

The eight pillars each held different powers; those eight forces converged in this small area into a terrifying killing ground, weaving a vast net that scourged body and mind.

What most shocked Yang Kai was that the pillars seemed peculiarly intent on drawing out people's strength and the essence of their flesh and blood.

Everyone's qi and blood were rapidly drained, and their power fluctuations gradually weakened.

"Master, use Demon God Transformation!" Li Rong suddenly cried out.

Yang Kai clenched his teeth against the torment and, without hesitation, unleashed the divine art passed down from the Great Demon God: the Demon God Transformation.

Heaven and earth shook as a dense tide of evil energy surged from his Indomitable Golden Body, replacing the Yang-source that had been in his meridians and flesh; the Demon Marks impressed into his flesh faded away, converging into an array invisible to the eye.

The next instant, Yang Kai felt a sudden ease.

The physical torment he had endured vanished after he performed Demon God Transformation; the pillar binding him ceased to extract his fleshly essence and inner strength.

At the same time he sensed an unusual aura coursing through the eight octagonal pillars.

Startled, Yang Kai snapped, "The methods of the Great Demon God?"

On another pillar, Li Rong nodded heavily.

Like Yang Kai, after performing Demon God Transformation she was unharmed; noticing that anomaly, she had urgently warned him.

The eight pillars flowed with the Great Demon God's aura—measures he had left behind—and because the Demon God Transformation and the Ancient Demon Clan were deeply tied to the Great Demon God, performing that technique could spare one the fleshly suffering.

Though it was only a guess Yang Kai made in an instant, it was likely the truth.

Turning his head, he saw the four yao still gritting their teeth; their transformed beast forms could not be maintained beyond ten breaths before automatically reverting to human shape.

Each looked haggard, their eyes blankly fixed on Yang Kai, and it would not be long before they might end up like Meng Wuya.

Yang Kai moved, attempting to break the pillar's bonds, but found it impossible.

In that anxious moment, Li Rong cried out again, "Master—there's movement."

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, staring intently ahead.

At the exact center of the octagonal pillars a misty figure was slowly condensing; gradually the shape became solid and clear.

Tall and powerfully built, his presence radiated authority without a hint of anger. His radiant eyes gleamed with divine light as he scrutinized Yang Kai and Li Rong with a trace of doubt.

Seeing the figure, Yang Kai suddenly curled his lips into a silent, eerie smile.

Li Rong's beautiful eyes widened as she stared at the apparition; the image overlapped with a figure in her mind and she cried out in disbelief, "The Great Demon God?"

The man who had materialized from mist to flesh was exactly the same as the statue standing before Mogu Castle.

The statue at Mogu Castle had been carved by the Ancient Demon Clan's ancestors who once served the Great Demon God, so they naturally knew his appearance.

Hearing Li Rong's cry, the four yao went pale.

Even though the Great Demon God had perished countless years ago, his renown was enough to shake the world—a legendary figure of unattainable height.

"So it is you!" Yang Kai said in a low, hoarse voice.

"But... didn't the Great Demon God fall long ago?" Li Rong could not bring herself to believe the eerie apparition was truly the Great Demon God, yet the aura emanating from him left no doubt.

"He is not the Great Demon God's true body; he is merely a Soul Incarnation—can't you see he lacks a physical form?" Yang Kai's gaze burned as he stared ahead.

"Soul Incarnation? What is that?" Li Rong exclaimed.

Yang Kai only shook his head and offered no explanation.

He had once obtained pure Demon God Golden Blood and had thereby comprehended an Incarnation Technique.

He had also cultivated that art; the Soul Incarnation he created remained nurtured in his Sea of Consciousness and was temporarily of no use.

But the Great Demon God was different—if this art belonged to him, then his Soul Incarnation would be incomparably powerful, even comparable to the true body.

The moment Yang Kai saw the figure he immediately understood its origin.

"Oh? You know quite a lot, not undeserving of being the one I chose as my successor!" the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation said, smiling faintly as its voice rang directly in Yang Kai's mind.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Looks like you know a fair bit about me as well."

The Soul Incarnation snorted, "If I hadn't sensed my remains, I wouldn't have shown myself. And this woman—she should be a descendant of those who once served me, correct? Demon God Transformation isn't something just anyone can learn."

Li Rong was so astonished she was speechless; her eyes were full of fevered worship and excitement. As a scion of the Ancient Demon Clan she had imagined the Great Demon God countless times, but seeing him now rendered all her imaginings pale.

Even though she was now a top Third Stage of the Saint Realm expert, before the methods the Great Demon God had laid long ago she had no resistance and was directly captured.

Had the other not revealed himself, her and Yang Kai's situation would likely have been no different from that of the four yao.

She could not imagine what world-shattering techniques the Great Demon God must have possessed in life.

"Since we have such a connection, perhaps we can talk?" Yang Kai looked at him.

"What do you want to discuss?"

"Release my friends. They were only dragged in because of me. And the old man who entered earlier—he has ties to me as well."

The Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation looked at him at leisure and suddenly sneered, "Boy, are you mistaken? Do you think because you are my chosen successor you can bargain? If you truly think that, you'll be disappointed."

Yang Kai frowned, sensing the matter was not simple. "Why did you seize them? And why lay such measures here?"

"I did not set out to seize them; they trespassed where they ought not to have gone!" the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation said slowly. "Anyone who enters here should not expect to leave alive—this place is the nexus of the entire continent."

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai asked urgently.

"It is too early to tell you that now. Since you possess my remains, one day you will reach my level and then you will understand," the Soul Incarnation said with impatience. "Seeing that you have inherited my will, I can allow you and this woman to leave—do not trespass here again, or I will show no mercy."
