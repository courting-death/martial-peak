## Chapter 2421 — The Marriage Is Off

Feng Xi tossed the ring to Yang Kai, staring at him anxiously and urging, "The ring is yours, so now you’ll let us go, right?"

Yang Kai reached out and caught it, sneering coldly, his gaze at Feng Xi full of mockery.

Feng Xi’s heart skipped a beat, thinking this man wouldn’t go back on his word, would he? Following Yang Kai’s gaze, Feng Xi looked at the ring on his own hand, steeled himself, gritted his teeth, and took off his own Spatial Ring, throwing it to Yang Kai as well. "This one too! Just let me go!"

"Sect Master is so generous, how could I possibly accept?" Yang Kai hurriedly took his Spatial Ring as well, stuffing it into his pocket without even looking at it. Then, with a cold snort, he said, "I said before, as long as I got the Vice Sect Master’s Spatial Ring, I’d let you all go. But now Sect Master has forced a second ring on me for no reason—are you trying to frame me as ungrateful and unjust?"

"Ah..." Feng Xi’s mouth fell open. He never imagined Yang Kai would say something so shameless.

The women of Ice Heart Valley all wore extremely strange expressions, each looking at Yang Kai with complicated eyes. Today, this young man’s behavior had truly refreshed their understanding of the limits of morality. Before meeting Yang Kai, they had never imagined someone could be so shameless.

Perhaps Feng Xi’s mind suddenly cleared, for seeing Yang Kai’s unfriendly expression, he quickly said, "Brother, you misunderstand. That Spatial Ring was just a gift from me, not part of the previous deal. Brother, you are dignified and extraordinary—surely you’ll achieve great things in the future. I just... just wanted to make friends with you!"

Yang Kai burst out laughing. "Sect Master is so generous—this is a friend worth making!"

Feng Xi’s lips twitched as he forced an awkward smile. “Th-then… may we leave now?”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. “Does the Young Sect Master plan to stay and have breakfast?”

"No, no." Feng Xi, as if granted amnesty, hurriedly stood up, dragging Yao Zhuo with him as they stumbled out of Ice Heart Valley.

Ever since Feng Xi had forcibly taken his Spatial Ring, Yao Zhuo seemed soulless, his eyes empty, as if in despair at Feng Xi’s actions. Now, being dragged away, he didn’t resist at all.

In a short while, Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi had disappeared without a trace.

Only now did the women of Ice Heart Valley finally breathe a sigh of relief. Earlier, when Yang Kai had wielded the Ancestor’s Token and commanded them to kill those two from Wenqing Sect, they had been secretly worried, afraid things would get out of hand. Fortunately, although Yang Kai ended up robbing them of two Spatial Rings, things hadn’t become irreparable—at least Feng Xi and Yao Zhuo’s lives weren’t in danger.

"Young Master, where is my Master now?" Only now did An Ruoyun have the chance to ask about what she cared about most.

Yang Kai turned to look at her. "Senior An, don’t worry. Senior Bing Yun is very safe right now, but it’s not convenient for her to see you these days."

"Not convenient?" Sun Yunxiu frowned, asking urgently, "Why not?"

Yang Kai shot her a cold look. "It’s just not convenient. There’s no why."

Sun Yunxiu was left speechless. With her temper, she would have exploded long ago, but Yang Kai was sent by her Master and held the Ancestor’s Token, so she could only swallow her anger.

Changsun Ying asked, "Then when can we see Master?"

Yang Kai thought for a moment. "Two or three days. Just wait." He paused, then turned to Sun Yunxiu and sneered, "I hope that when the Great Elder meets Senior Bing Yun, she can clearly explain Zi Yu’s marriage."

Sun Yunxiu’s expression dimmed, but she still said in a low voice, "If Master wants to punish or scold, I’ll take it all. It has nothing to do with the other sisters."

Yang Kai sneered. Although Sun Yunxiu’s attitude just now was decent—even after being slapped by him, she didn’t hold a grudge—just for agreeing to let Zi Yu marry Feng Xi, she couldn’t escape punishment.

Pushing her most outstanding disciple into the Wenqing Sect’s fire pit—her time as Great Elder was over. But after all, this was their sect’s internal matter, so even if Yang Kai was indignant, he couldn’t say much more.

An Ruoyun seemed to think of something, looking at Yang Kai with concern. "Young Master, you keep saying Master is indisposed and that it’ll be two or three days. Could it be... Master is injured and recuperating?"

At her words, all the women’s faces changed.

Back when Bing Yun left Ice Heart Valley, she was already at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Three thousand years had passed, and her strength must have grown even deeper. Even in the entire Star Realm, she was a top expert—how could someone like her be injured? Who in the world could possibly hurt her?

Yang Kai glanced at An Ruoyun in surprise, a bit impressed by her keen mind. He hadn’t said anything, yet she’d guessed the truth—clearly, she was perceptive.

Since everyone here was Ice Heart Valley’s upper echelon, many of them Bing Yun’s direct disciples, Yang Kai didn’t hide it any longer. He nodded solemnly. "Senior An is right. Senior Bing Yun is indeed injured."

Instantly, all the women of Ice Heart Valley turned pale.

Yang Kai quickly added, "But don’t worry, everyone. Senior Bing Yun’s injuries aren’t serious. She’s recuperating in Binglun City right now, and in two or three days, she’ll be fully recovered!"

"Master is in Binglun City?" An Ruoyun exclaimed.

Changsun Ying was also excited. "Can you take us to see Master?"

Yang Kai frowned. "Senior Bing Yun is still healing. Wouldn’t it be bad to disturb her now?"

An Ruoyun said, "We won’t disturb Master. We just want to be closer to her, Young Master, please."

Though she was at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, at this moment she looked like a child who had waited years for her parents to return—both excited and anxious. The others all looked at Yang Kai with pleading faces.

Under the gaze of so many beautiful eyes, Yang Kai couldn’t take it and finally relented. "Fine, fine, I’ll take you to see Senior Bing Yun."

"Thank you!" All the women’s faces relaxed, overjoyed.

Immediately, An Ruoyun ordered the disciples to activate all of Ice Heart Valley’s protective arrays and guard the sect well. Only then did she set off with Yang Kai toward Binglun City.

Over a dozen people, with only Yang Kai as the sole man. The procession was grand, and except for Yang Kai and Zi Yu, everyone else was an Emperor Realm expert.

Such a force naturally attracted attention as they moved.

When they reached Binglun City’s gates, the guards were about to step forward to question them, but seeing the Emperor Realm experts behind Yang Kai, they immediately retreated to the side, not daring to breathe too loudly.

Binglun City was Ice Heart Valley’s domain, and many shops in the city were run by Ice Heart Valley disciples. So as An Ruoyun and the others entered, disciples kept flying out from the shops on both sides to greet them respectfully.

With all this commotion, it took only moments for everyone in Binglun City to know that Ice Heart Valley’s upper echelon had mobilized. No one knew what they were here for.

The puppet City Lord supported by Ice Heart Valley came running over, sweating profusely, to greet them, trembling in fear that he’d done something wrong and was about to be punished.

But An Ruoyun and the others just greeted him and ignored him, leaving the puppet City Lord both bitter and relieved.

"This one greets Valley Lord An, Great Elder Sun, and all the Elders. Congratulations to Ice Heart Valley and Wenqing Sect on your joyous union—truly a cause for celebration!" Suddenly, a man flew over and landed in front of the group, smiling and cupping his fists.

He was a middle-aged man with the cultivation of the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, clearly a powerful figure from some Northern Territory sect. Judging by his demeanor, he was here to attend the wedding and had come to greet them after hearing of their arrival in Binglun City.

An Ruoyun paused, but before she could reply, Emperor Realm experts appeared from all directions, just like the man surnamed Hu, offering their congratulations.

An Ruoyun clearly recognized them all and exchanged a few polite words.

After the greetings, the man surnamed Hu asked suspiciously, "Valley Lord An, what brings you to Binglun City today?"

Although Binglun City was Ice Heart Valley’s property and a hub for their dealings with the outside world, the upper echelon rarely appeared here—let alone all at once.

Everyone faintly sensed something was off, as if a storm was brewing and something major was about to happen.

"We have some business. Please, everyone, do as you please!" Sun Yunxiu replied coldly, her face expressionless. "Also, from today, the marriage between our disciple Zi Yu and Wenqing Sect’s Sect Master Feng Xi is canceled. There’s no need for you all to stay here—please return to where you came from."

"Junior Sister Sun’s words are a bit blunt. Please forgive us. You’ve come all this way, and Ice Heart Valley hasn’t hosted you well." An Ruoyun smiled gently, then led the group into the city.

Leaving a group of Emperor Realm experts standing there, dumbfounded.

After a while, once An Ruoyun and the others had disappeared, someone wiped the sweat from his forehead and swallowed. "Brother Hu Yuan, did I hear that right? Did Valley Lord An and Elder Sun say... the marriage is off?"

"I heard it too."

"This is bad, really bad. What are those women from Ice Heart Valley up to?" The man called Hu Yuan was also sweating, extremely nervous.

Someone said, "I wonder if the marriage being called off is just Ice Heart Valley’s decision, or if they’ve reached an agreement with Wenqing Sect. If it’s just their decision..."

Everyone’s expressions darkened, suddenly realizing things were not looking good.

If it was only Ice Heart Valley’s decision, Wenqing Sect definitely wouldn’t let it go.

"Wenqing Sect disciples cultivate the Supreme Sentiment Art, using emotion to enter the Dao. Once they set their sights on a woman, they never give up easily—let alone when it’s the Sect Master Feng Xi. In my humble opinion, Wenqing Sect won’t give up on this marriage."
