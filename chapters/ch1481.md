## Chapter 1481 — Treading Iron Shoes in Vain

This turned out to be a single, precious Dragon-Flame Purple Marrow Pill! Yang Kai could not help but be stirred.

The Dragon-Flame Purple Marrow Pill is a Void King-Grade Lower-Level spiritual pill; the materials required to refine it are excessively numerous — as many as fifty to sixty different ingredients. Its effect for a martial artist is also direct and simple.

It increases strength!

Once a martial artist ascends to the level of the Void King Realm, cultivation becomes extremely arduous; the Spiritual Qi produced by ordinary Earth Veins and even Upper-Level Saint Crystals cannot meet the demands of Void King Realm experts' refinement. Thus, in very ancient times the Dragon-Flame Purple Marrow Pill became another reliance for Void King Realm experts to advance their power.

Absorbing the medicinal efficacy contained within a pill also aids a martial artist's growth, though compared to ordinary sitting cultivation this method has its advantages and disadvantages.

The advantage is that, so long as the pills are sufficient, the speed of power increase is rapid — not even remotely comparable to painstaking meditation.

The drawback is that the strength gained by this means may be somewhat unstable; moreover, if one consumes too many spiritual pills, it can place a certain burden on the body.

Therefore no martial artist's advancement relies entirely on spiritual pills; even when pills are used to cultivate, it is only occasionally and with great restraint, not for long-term use.

Along his path Yang Kai had, for the most part, not relied on spiritual pills for cultivation, so his foundation was exceedingly solid and his Saint Yuan was pure and powerful.

Realizing the potential use of this Void King-Grade pill, Yang Kai felt his heart surge with excitement!

This was a pill capable of increasing the strength of a Void King Realm expert; having been refined by the valley's owner it had given off a Pill Cloud and, after tens of thousands of years of accumulation and settling, how astonishingly potent the contained medicinal efficacy might be even he could not judge.

He could only vaguely suppose that, if he were now capable of taking this pill and safely digesting it, his strength very likely could take a single step into the Void King Realm!

He would be spared years of bitter cultivation.

This was an exceedingly terrifying leap.

But this was only conjecture; Yang Kai had enough self-awareness to know such a pill was not something he could reach for at present.

Reluctantly tucking the Dragon-Flame Purple Marrow Pill away once more, Yang Kai dispelled the stirring at his heart. He calmed his qi and steadied his mind, then took two other items from the Spatial Ring.

One was crimson as blood and only the size of a heart; the other was jet-black and perfectly round.

Two strange stones.

One was a Blood Essence Stone he had obtained by chance in the Imperial Garden. The other was a Stone Puppet stone embryo that Yang Kai had kept for many years.

Yang Kai had two Stone Puppet embryos in total, both brought from the Tongxuan Continent. When he first came to Dark Star, one embryo fused with a Blood Essence Stone and gave birth to a Stone Puppet, which Yang Yan named Xiaoxiao.

The other embryo, though it had reached maturity, could not break forth because it lacked a Blood Essence Stone to serve as its heart.

It was not until this trip to the Imperial Garden that Yang Kai finally achieved his wish.

Yang Yan had envied Yang Kai for possessing a Stone Puppet, so Yang Kai had long intended to hatch the second Stone Puppet and give it to her.

Whether Yang Yan would still want it now he could not say; recalling her present circumstances he could not help but smile bitterly. Whether she wanted it or not, it was nonetheless right to let the Blood Essence Stone fuse with the embryo first.

With that in mind, Yang Kai placed the two strange stones together.

Strangely, the embryo that had been peacefully kept within the Black Book Space, at the instant it touched the Blood Essence Stone, suddenly erupted countless black filaments from within, wrapping the ruby-red Blood Essence Stone.

In the blink of an eye the two were tightly bound together, appearing almost as one, though to fully fuse would likely still require a long time.

The sight made Yang Kai click his tongue in wonder. After a moment's thought he moved his Divine Sense and silently called out a few times.

A moment later the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao appeared like a whirlwind before him, fixing him with a pair of clear, innocent eyes.

"I'll leave this for you to care for, all right?" Yang Kai asked, pointing at the black-and-red fused stones.

The Stone Puppet's intelligence was not high, but it could understand Yang Kai's orders. Following his pointing, once it saw the thing before it its pupils immediately widened and a light of joy and excitement burst forth.

It could sense that within that black-and-red fused stone a companion of its own was being nurtured.

It nodded again and again, its face full of longing.

“Mm. Take it down below, and remember to report to me at once if anything happens,” Yang Kai instructed calmly. The Stone Puppet immediately lifted the fused mass of the two strange stones, and with a flicker of its figure, vanished from sight.

It would likely not be long before the second Stone Puppet could be born; Yang Kai secretly looked forward to it.

Next he checked the Spatial Ring of the Demon Blood Sect's alluring Sect Master.

This woman and Jin Shi had both fallen on the Ice Path of the Imperial Garden; Jin Shi's Spatial Ring had been banished into the void by Yang Kai with his Space Blade and could not be retrieved, leaving only the ring of the Demon Blood Sect's leader.

As the head of a sect, her belongings were naturally exceedingly abundant.

Yang Kai swept his hand over her Spatial Ring and emptied out everything inside.

Countless Saint Crystals — at least several tens of millions in total — various secret treasures of differing ranks, hundreds of jade bottles containing spiritual pills, and a number of materials for refining pills and forging artifacts.

A dazzling array that left one overwhelmed.

Yang Kai raised a brow; though most of these items failed to interest him, they still constituted wealth, so he patiently sorted them, keeping what was useful to himself and setting the rest aside to fill Lingxiao Sect's warehouse.

Although there weren’t many members in the sect now, since the Lingxiao Sect had sealed its mountain gates and had little contact with the outside world, it had to be entirely self-sufficient in cultivation resources. These things that Yang Kai disdained were still priceless treasures to the junior disciples.

After a round of sorting everything was quickly in order.

"Hm? This is..." Yang Kai's eyes brightened and with a look of surprise he picked up a beast-hide book.

This beast-hide book had also been in the Demon Blood Sect leader's Spatial Ring; at first he had not noticed it, only finding it after most of the inventory had been checked.

The beast-hide book was not large, but its pages were crimson as if soaked in fresh blood, and through the leaves one could smell a thick, bloody stench.

This could not be...

Yang Kai's heart leapt; he hurriedly opened the first page, and the several great characters that met his eyes stunned him for a moment, then he burst into loud laughter.

Truly, one may wear out iron shoes seeking in vain, only to find what they seek without any effort.

What was recorded on that beast-hide book was none other than the complete set of the Secret Technique for the Demon Blood Threads!

Ever since obtaining the Demon Blood Threads Secret Technique from Deng Ning of the Demon Blood Sect, Yang Kai had been cultivating it diligently. This technique had aided him greatly, earning countless merits in battle, and Yang Kai had come to rely on it quite a bit.

Although the Demon Blood Threads Secret Technique imposed all manner of restraints on Demon Blood Sect disciples, it seemed as if the technique had been tailor-made for Yang Kai.

He possessed a capital and backing far greater than any Demon Blood Sect disciple: an endless supply of Golden Blood!

Unfortunately, what Yang Kai had received from Deng Ning was only the upper half!

After cultivating the Golden Blood Threads he had vaguely sensed there should be further variations, and after seeing the Demon Blood Sect leader that speculation had been confirmed.

Sadly he had no way to obtain the lower half of the Demon Blood Threads technique.

Unexpectedly, after slaying the Demon Blood Sect leader he found it inside her Spatial Ring.

It was not surprising: infighting was constant in the Demon Blood Sect and personal martial prowess was esteemed; since the beauty had been the sect's leader, such a treasure would naturally be carried on her person, and upon her fall it became Yang Kai's gain.

Yang Kai was ecstatic, carefully studying it and confirming it was indeed the Demon Blood Threads Secret Technique — not only including the upper half he had practiced, but also the lower half explaining the variations of Demon Blood Threads.

It also contained the method to refine that Blood Fusion Pill!

The Blood Fusion Pill was a pill uniquely created by the Demon Blood Sect that could increase a martial artist's Qi and blood power. Every disciple cultivating Demon Blood Threads coveted such a pill, because increasing Qi and blood would in turn increase the power of the Demon Blood Threads.

At the time Deng Ning had performed meritorious service in the Flowing Flame Sandland he had been granted the upper half of the Demon Blood Threads and a single Blood Fusion Pill.

He treasured it as if it were his life.

After all, within the Demon Blood Sect only a few elders and the Sect Master themselves were qualified to consume a Blood Fusion Pill; ordinary disciples could not obtain one except by reward.

Yang Kai carefully pondered the refining method for the Blood Fusion Pill, and once he understood how it was made he immediately lost interest.

The reason was simple: to refine this wicked pill required collecting a great deal of fresh blood — and preferably human blood!

If he wished to increase his Qi and blood power he could simply take Life Jade Nectar; on the Imperial Garden trip he had obtained a large amount of the purest Life Jade Nectar, so the Blood Fusion Pill held no appeal.

Yet the lower half of the Demon Blood Threads' variations was exactly what he craved; his Golden Blood Threads were too one-dimensional in combat, and if he could assimilate the lower half, the Golden Blood Threads could play a far greater role in future battles.

Cultivation was not urgent; Yang Kai still had one last item to inspect.

It was the stone plaque that had flown out when the stele containing the Artifact Refining Dao had shattered during the battle with the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

When that stone plaque had first been seen, Xue Yue's face had changed and she had even pleaded with Yang Kai to hand it over. Yang Kai had been inclined to do so — he did not yet understand its value — but before any agreement could be reached the Imperial Garden suddenly closed and transported him to the outer sea.

Xue Yue was likely furious about it now.

Frankly, Yang Kai was extremely curious about a stone plaque that had made Xue Yue value it so highly; now that he had it out he intended to study it.

The stone plaque was small, only palm-sized, and no one knew why it had been hidden inside that stele. Had the stele not been shattered in the fierce battle, the plaque might have never seen the light of day.

All of this could only be called an extraordinary coincidence.

Even more coincidentally, it had flown toward him and become his.

Whatever it was, a glance would reveal its nature. Xue Yue had said it was of no use to Origin Returning Realm martial artists and only useful to Void King Realm ones — Yang Kai was curious.
