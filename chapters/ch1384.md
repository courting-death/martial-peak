## Chapter 1384 — Lu Ye Ambushed

As if she had long anticipated Yang Yan would say that, Yang Kai smiled faintly and handed the Star Emperor Token he had exchanged with Ge Qi to Yang Yan.

Yang Yan took it, a complex expression flitting across her face as she lightly stroked it; her features kept shifting, and a trace of recollection surfaced in her beautiful eyes.

Yang Kai sat upright at her side, saying nothing so as not to disturb her.

After a full half hour, the strange expression on Yang Yan's face faded; she exhaled heavily and returned the Star Emperor Token to Yang Kai. "Keep this safe — it may prove of great use later."

"Great use?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "In what way?"

"I do not know for certain," Yang Yan slowly shook her head. "It is only a feeling. I can't explain it clearly even if you press me. But it surely hides some secret, and rumor says the Great Emperor forged ten Star Emperor Tokens in his life — perhaps all ten must be gathered to unravel the mystery."

After saying this she gave a self-mocking smile. "But gathering ten Star Emperor Tokens would be unbelievably difficult — an ordinary person obtaining one in a lifetime is already a remarkable fate; how could one possibly collect ten?"

"Is that so?" Yang Kai gave an odd little smile. "I have some here as well."

"What?" Yang Yan stared at him in amazement, then her eyes widened as she looked at another Star Emperor Token that had mysteriously appeared in Yang Kai's hand, and she fell silent for a long time.

That Star Emperor Token was essentially identical to the one traded with Ge Qi; there was no visible difference. In both the internal sealed divine technique had already been triggered, yet the residual Imperial Might was unmistakably clear — evidently also forged by the Great Emperor.

That was not all. With a flick of Yang Kai's hand, another Star Emperor Token appeared.

When Yang Yan saw the third Star Emperor Token she brought a hand to her mouth, her beautiful eyes trembling violently as she murmured, "Could this possibly be…"

The third Star Emperor Token bore a clear difference from the first two; though its appearance was identical, it exuded energy fluctuations that made one's heart skip a beat. Yang Yan, well versed in such matters, immediately sensed the hidden mystery.

"Yes — this is an intact Star Emperor Token!" Yang Kai smiled slightly and tossed it to Yang Yan.

Yang Yan fumbled and caught it.

An unexpected scene then unfolded.

The moment the intact Star Emperor Token was seized by Yang Yan, a visible ring of spiritual resonance rippled outward. At the same time the token emitted a clear, birdlike trill — neither quite sparrow nor other, piercing and distinct — and on the token flashed the image of a strange cyan bird, its body long and slender with long plumes trailing from its tail.

Immediately, a faint resonance occurred between the Saint Yuan within Yang Yan and the energy stored in the Star Emperor Token, causing both to float up involuntarily.

A chorus of hissing sounds erupted as the Spiritual Qi in the entire stone residence went chaotic in an instant. A pressure descended from the heavens that made Yang Kai's expression change drastically.

Yang Kai had no idea what was happening. He hurriedly manifested the Purple Shield, circulated his Saint Yuan to protect his body, then extended his Divine Sense to probe Yang Yan's condition.

After a moment of investigation Yang Kai was astonished.

He discovered Yang Yan showed no signs of injury. Rather, she seemed to be receiving some kind of information from the Star Emperor Token; her eyes were tightly closed, her lashes trembling, her brows contracting and relaxing in turn.

The scene did not last long, only a dozen or so breaths. Just when Yang Kai did not know what to do, Yang Yan suddenly opened her eyes, snatched the Star Emperor Token floating before her, drifted lightly to the ground, and stared blankly as if lost in thought.

"What happened?" Yang Kai asked hurriedly.

Yang Yan glanced at him but did not answer directly. "You haven't refined it, have you?"

"This thing can be refined?" Yang Kai was incredulous.

Yang Yan gave a faint smile. "It counts as a kind of Secret Treasure, but a one-time Secret Treasure; naturally it can be refined. Luckily you had it locked away and never used it — otherwise you would surely be dead."

Yang Kai showed no surprise. Ghost Ancestor had told him of such matters before, so even when situations had grown dangerous over the years he never once considered using a Star Emperor Token; a do-or-die trump card against an enemy was not something he would produce lightly.

"You seem to know many things," Yang Kai frowned and looked at her.

"What are you trying to say?" Yang Yan pursed her red lips, a hint of unease on her face.

"Ever since you inexplicably fainted last time, I've felt you changed a great deal. What are you hiding? Is there something you can't tell me?" Yang Kai decided to voice his doubts accumulated over this time, especially since earlier Ge Qi had behaved like he was seeing a ghost upon seeing Yang Yan, yet she claimed never to have met him. Now the Star Emperor Token had resonated with Yang Yan as well, and Yang Kai could no longer ignore it.

He intended to speak openly and honestly with Yang Yan.

"I have nothing to hide, it's just…" Yang Yan wore a look of hesitation.

"Just what?"

"I myself am not certain, so I did not say anything. When I am sure I will tell you, all right?" Yang Yan pleaded as she looked at him.

Yang Kai pondered a moment and then grinned. "Tell me how this thing should be refined — I tried studying it before but achieved nothing."

Seeing Yang Kai stop pressing her, Yang Yan relaxed and laughed happily. "I only just learned it too, hee hee."

Saying this, she condensed a strand of Saint Yuan like a sword on her fingertip and made a quick cut across her wrist. Blood poured forth, and Yang Yan pressed the Star Emperor Token against the wound.

Yang Kai heard a chilling, hair-raising sound, like starving ghosts devouring flesh. The blood streaming from Yang Yan's wrist was swallowed by the Star Emperor Token not a drop remaining.

In the blink of an eye the Star Emperor Token turned the color of fresh blood.

After doing this Yang Yan seemed somewhat fatigued; she tossed the Star Emperor Token back to Yang Kai and sat down cross-legged.

"Is that enough?" Yang Kai looked at the Star Emperor Token in his hand in astonishment, finding that only its color had changed and nothing else appeared altered.

"Yes." Yang Yan nodded seriously.

Yang Kai looked puzzled. If refining it required blood to be supplied, it should be the refiner's own blood — why had Yang Yan provided her blood?

"You try it and you'll know," Yang Yan pouted, then rose and walked outside, admonishing, "Be sure to guard these three Star Emperor Tokens carefully."

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded helplessly.

After Yang Yan left, Yang Kai, still half doubtful, gripped the crimson Star Emperor Token in his palm and attempted to pour his Saint Yuan into it. Unexpectedly, his Saint Yuan flowed in effortlessly with no resistance and gave no sign of activating the internal sealed divine technique. The token seemed like a bottomless pit, constantly devouring Yang Kai's Saint Yuan and establishing a faint, ephemeral link.

This was clearly the beginning of refining a Secret Treasure, and Yang Kai rejoiced. He immediately understood Yang Yan had been correct and devoted himself wholeheartedly to the task.

At the same time, roughly three hundred li from Dragon Lair Mountain, in a stretch of forest.

A young man flew forward as if unconcerned, his speed neither fast nor slow.

If Yang Kai were present he would certainly have struck at him without hesitation — for this fellow was the one who made Yang Kai grind his teeth in hatred: Lu Ye of Liu Yun Valley. From the direction he flew it was clear he intended to return to the Xie Family.

A faint smile lifted Lu Ye's lips; the amusement on his face was intriguing. Suddenly the Star Shuttle under his feet shifted and he sped directly into the forest. After a moment he lightly landed and stood with his hands clasped behind his back.

The surroundings were silent, only the rustle of leaves as the breeze passed.

"Well? Are you all hiding here to ambush Lu? If so, hurry and show yourselves — Lu has already arrived; why hide?" Lu Ye tilted his head and cast a glance at the thick trees on either side.

No one answered and no one appeared, as if Lu Ye were entirely alone.

Yet Lu Ye's expression remained certain; he sneered, "A pack of timorous rats dare to ambush Lu — very well, since you won't show yourselves, don't blame me for being impolite."

"Kid, you have sharp eyes to see through our concealment. Too bad for you — your fate has run out!" a loud voice rang out, and in the next moment several people leaped down from a great tree.

Immediately the surrounding foliage rustled and figures sprang up from all sides, each gazing at Lu Ye with ill intent.

In the blink of an eye Lu Ye was heavily surrounded, facing a situation with no road to the sky and no path to the earth.

At the recent auction Lu Ye had spent extravagantly and thus attracted many eyes. Although he had silently slipped away before the end, many had secretly followed him.

They knew he planned to return to the Xie Family to lodge, so they lay in wait in this forest to ambush him.

Sure enough, Lu Ye passed through here. What these schemers had not expected was that Lu Ye would be so recklessly bold as to walk straight into their trap despite knowing ambushes awaited.

The man who had spoken earlier cultivated at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; he was squat and ugly, with a large swelling on his forehead, and he regarded Lu Ye with a malicious smile as he said, "Not bad, not bad — uncommon courage. It's been many years since I've seen such guts."

"Brother Cheng, why waste words with him? Just attack already." Nearby, a middle-aged man with three long strands of beard urged impatiently. Though at first glance he appeared much older than the martial artist surnamed Cheng, the two were actually similar in age—only their looks differed.

"Indeed — the longer we wait the more we gain; this kid is rich, our haul will be considerable."

"Why hurry?" Cheng snorted coldly. "We will strike, of course — but how to divide the spoils should be discussed first."

There were three gangs in total: three Origin Returning Realm fighters, others of the Saint King Realm and the Saint Realm, numbering around fifteen or sixteen in all.
