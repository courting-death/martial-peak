## Chapter 616 —  What Did I Do to Offend Them?

Yang Kai shook his head faintly. His cultivation sat at the Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage; such a level might still be respectable back in the Great Han, but having come to the Tongxuan Continent and learned the secret of ascending from the Transcendent into the Saint, he no longer dared think so.

At this level of cultivation, he remained somewhat disadvantaged before the Transcendent Realm.

He had to raise his strength as soon as possible if he wished to accomplish anything in this vast, majestic world, and only with greater power could he search for Su Yan and his Little Senior Sister.

Without power, nowhere was safe.

"Have you ascertained where this place is?" Yang Kai asked.

While he had been breaking through, Shui Ling had been nearby scouting the terrain, trying to confirm their location.

Hearing this, Shui Ling shook her head gloomily. "Although this patch of swamp is a little unusual, there are many swamps on the Tongxuan Continent. I can't be certain exactly where we are right now, but it should be on human territory."

"Human territory?" Yang Kai could not help but feel puzzled at her words.

"Oh, I forgot to tell you. On the Tongxuan Continent there are not only humans, but also demons and yao; the three are all powerful and stand in equilibrium. Places where humans are active are called human territory, the demon race occupy the Demon Domain, the yao dwell in the Yao Realm, and between them lies a neutral zone. Besides these three great races there are many strange peoples — you will come to know them in time." Shui Ling explained casually, not wishing to go into too much detail; after all, these were common knowledge. If Yang Kai remained here, he would learn it all sooner or later.

Yang Kai stood dumbfounded.

Shui Ling smiled and added a word. "Isn't there a seventh‑tier demonic beast over in your world called the Spider Mother? If it can assume human form, then it is counted among the Yao, but that requires the power of the Huasheng Pool — a treasure of the yao. Don't be shocked; you will see many things here that you never even imagined."

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "I suppose I'm just inexperienced and overreacted."

Suddenly recalling something, he asked in a low voice, "Have you heard of the name Demon General Meng Ge?"

At those words Shui Ling's expression changed drastically. "You know him?"

"There really is such a person?" Yang Kai was surprised; he had asked only in passing, but from Shui Ling's reaction it was clear this was no ordinary figure.

Back when Yang Kai had been training in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave within the Cangyun Evil Land, the cave had undergone a mutation. Four top underlings of the Yinming Ghost King entered the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave to investigate and were met by a powerful being that had emerged from the Evil Spirit Spring Eye — it killed two instantly and severely wounded the other two.

In the end Yang Kai had relied on the Locking Demon Chain to annihilate that powerful presence. In its death throes it had claimed to be but a fragment of Demon General Meng Ge and had warned Yang Kai to be careful, saying it had taken note of his aura.

Yang Kai had never understood exactly what kind of status the Demon General held; now, hearing Shui Ling speak of the demon and yao races, the matter suddenly returned to him.

"He's not human; he's a demon powerhouse!" Shui Ling stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, her face showing a trace of terror as she forced a bitter smile. "You're a strange man — having stayed in that other world so long, how do you come to know Demon General Meng Ge?"

Yang Kai briefly recounted what had occurred in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

Shui Ling's face turned ashen; she regarded Yang Kai with a measure of sympathy. "You actually injured one of his fragments… From now on, if you hear his name, avoid him at all costs. He is a demon race powerhouse you cannot provoke."

"How powerful is he?" Yang Kai asked in a low tone.

"By your account, a single fragment of his possessed near‑Transcendent Realm cultivation. His true body is a top Saint Realm expert — I don't know which Saint Stage he has reached, but many cultivators in human territory fear him."

Yang Kai drew in a long breath. He had not expected the person he had offended back then to be such a figure. He nodded slightly. "I understand."

No sooner had he spoken than Yang Kai's expression turned cold; he rose at once and looked toward one side.

Shui Ling frowned as well and followed his gaze.

Over there, the auras of several Divine Roaming Realm cultivators were rapidly approaching. Though they strove to hide themselves, they could not escape Yang Kai's senses.

From the direction of their movement, it was clear they were focused on the two of them.

"A good chance to learn where this place is," Yang Kai said, giving Shui Ling a slight wink. Shui Ling smiled in understanding and composed herself.

She found that, having accompanied Yang Kai, her courage had grown considerably. In former times she would have fled at once to avoid trouble.

Before long seven or eight figures came into view. The leader was a woman dressed to attract attention, her charm mature and suggestive; her figure left little to the imagination, and a pale blue, high‑slit robe set off her curves to excellent effect.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened and his expression turned playful.

To have one's first sight on the Tongxuan Continent be such a beauty was a little surprising.

The woman wore a sullen expression, looking rather displeased.

The six or seven people behind her looked equally fierce and hostile. Upon seeing Yang Kai and Shui Ling they immediately displayed their anger.

The group's hostile manner puzzled Yang Kai; he could not fathom where he had offended them.

Yet he was confident and bold in skill, and stood quietly in place.

The woman led her people forward until they were within a dozen zhang, coldly scrutinizing Yang Kai and Shui Ling with obvious displeasure.

"Who are you, and why are you here?" she demanded coldly.

"Passing travelers," Yang Kai answered casually. "We accidentally wandered into this swamp and lost our way. May I ask what place this is?"

"You ask me what place this is?" the woman retorted, growing angrier. "How dare you ask me that?"

"Well, because we truly can't find a way out." Yang Kai shrugged. When he and Shui Ling had come from the Tianlang side they had suffered on the Wasteland; by the time they fell into this swamp they were covered in mud and looked utterly filthy and lost.

"If it's convenient, could you tell us?" Yang Kai smiled affably and asked, flashing a set of white teeth that made him look harmless.

"Convenient? Why wouldn't it be?" the woman sneered, waving a hand. "Ji Hong, seize these two. If they don't produce the Scarlet Blood True Orchid, take them to make your report!"

"Yes, Miss!" the bearded man replied, and, with the others, moved to act.

"Wait!" Yang Kai raised a hand to signal them to stop. Although he perceived their hostility, being new to the area he did not wish to draw unnecessary trouble. These were Divine Roaming Realm cultivators acting together, apparently from the same force; killing them would be easy, but inviting complications would not be worth it.

Moreover, the woman's earlier words had left Yang Kai thoroughly baffled.

To be targeted so inexplicably, Yang Kai felt wronged.

"What Scarlet Blood True Orchid?" Yang Kai asked with a frown.

"A Heaven‑and‑Earth Spiritual Object?" Shui Ling, who recognized such things, spoke and uncovered the truth.

"Correct. A Heaven‑and‑Earth Spiritual Object, and specifically a seven‑leaf Scarlet Blood True Orchid with a thousand years of medicinal age!" the woman snapped, nodding heavily.

"What does that have to do with us? We didn't see such a plant," Yang Kai protested, thinking they surely would not accuse him of stealing their treasure.

"I didn't say you saw it. Heh…" the woman laughed, then, sensing that simply seizing people without hearing them out might be improper, she questioned more patiently. "Tell me: just now, the two of you — you were breaking through and advancing, were you not?"

"Yes. What of it?" Yang Kai grew a little impatient. The woman's manner was dazzling but her words incoherent; the more she spoke, the more confused he became.

The commotion made by their advancement had been obvious; Yang Kai, without wanting to hide anything, admitted it at once.

"That's it! Because of the noise from your breakthrough, that Scarlet Blood True Orchid was frightened away, ruining more than a month's worth of our effort. Tell me — isn’t that your fault?"

"Uh…" Yang Kai and Shui Ling exchanged helpless looks.

When Yang Kai pieced together the woman's words, he quickly grasped the situation.

He had seen Heaven‑and‑Earth Spiritual Items before — Yin‑Yang Demon Ginseng, Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew — things that possessed consciousness and would flee danger, seeking fortune and avoiding disaster. If his breakthrough had indeed frightened that Scarlet Blood True Orchid away, it was possible.

At first full of anger, once he understood the situation Yang Kai felt a measure of embarrassment.

"Sorry, we didn't know you were after a Heaven‑and‑Earth Spiritual Object. If we'd known…" Yang Kai said helplessly.

Even had they known, the act of breaking through was not something he could have restrained.

Though inadvertent, he bore responsibility; they could only say the others' luck had indeed turned dreadfully sour.

"An apology won't do," the woman sneered. "That Scarlet Blood True Orchid is of great use to us; it is not something settled by a few words."

"Then what do you want?" Yang Kai's expression quickly hardened, the apology leaving his face as a cold, bemused smile spread across his lips.

Had they spoken civilly, he might have compensated them, but their aggressive manner offended him; there was no need to continue showing weakness.

If it came to blows, he was confident he could eliminate them within ten breaths.

It all depended on whether they chose to be reasonable.

Yang Kai's sudden change in attitude made the woman narrow her eyes. She snapped, "What? In the territory of my Duao Alliance, you still intend to pick a fight?"

"Duao Alliance?" Shui Ling suddenly smiled. "So you belong to the Duao Alliance. In that case, this should be the Zexi Marsh?"

"Correct." The woman nodded, eyeing the muddy, disheveled Shui Ling with suspicion. "You actually have some discernment. Who are you?"

Shui Ling smiled. "I am of the Water Divine Hall."

At those words the woman and her six or seven companions all changed color, staring at Shui Ling in silence.

Yang Kai read the situation and quietly felt that the Water Divine Hall's influence here might not be as weak as he had first supposed.
