## Chapter 921 — Struck Down

What left the five masters speechless was not Xia Ningshang's raw power.

Although she was at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, the masters paid that no mind; they simply assumed she was, like Yang Kai, a prodigy who practiced martial ways.

The key was that the nature of the force in her body was neither fire nor the Yang attribute.

Whether refining pills or forging treasures, one must employ scorching power to fuse medicinal effects with mineral essences so the Pill or Secret Treasure can be tempered into the desired form and the material can assert its function.

Thus pill-masters and artificers cultivate methods of the fire attribute or the Yang attribute, and the True Yuan in their bodies must carry fiery energy.

Yet the power that burst forth from Xia Ningshang contained only a very gentle, almost natural aura.

How could one refine pills with that? The five masters all froze.

But the next moment, they were all struck with astonishment.

Each Saint-Grade herb was wrapped in an invisible force and floated before Xia Ningshang; under that soft, nature-like energy, the herbs actually decomposed, their medicinal essences congealing together into drop after drop of extraordinarily pure elixir, while the useless impurities were cast aside.

Xia Ningshang remained still, only the power in her body continually cycling as her delicate hands formed strange seals and drew that essence toward the herbs.

The masters' expressions flickered wildly; each wore a look of disbelief, their eyes glued to Xia Ningshang, afraid even to miss one of her movements.

With the five masters' eyesight, it was plain to see that this young girl possessed profound accomplishments in pill refinement—her techniques for condensing elixirs and handling the details had reached consummate heights; even if they were to try it themselves, they might not do as well as Xia Ningshang.

Not a trace of the herbs' efficacy was wasted; under her marvelous skill it was all fully extracted and gradually converged.

Drop after drop of elixir hovered like pearls before Xia Ningshang.

With a finger as a brush and her True Yuan as ink, Xia Ningshang sketched exquisite spirit formation diagrams in the air as her power burst forth in a continuous flow.

Her speed had reached its limit.

The onlookers keenly noticed that the spirit formations she used were almost identical to those Yang Kai employed—clearly taught by the same hand.

Gradually the five masters were drawn in; all held their breath and fell silent, daring not to make a sound for fear of disturbing Xia Ningshang.

They no longer doubted Xia Ningshang's ability to refine pills—the wondrous scene before them had already answered that.

One who cannot refine pills would not understand the spirit formations of pillcraft, nor could they so perfectly temper elixirs.

Moreover, Xia Ningshang's refining technique possessed a kind of aesthetic beauty that left them enraptured; forgetting themselves, they followed her movements and felt as if they had slipped into a wondrous realm—a world belonging to pill refinement.

A broad, well-paved path seemed to lie at their feet, the road ahead shining bright.

In that moment, each felt their soul had undergone a baptism; the pillcraft steeped in a hundred years of history seemed to show signs of transcendence.

The complex and profound spirit formation diagrams slowly took shape; lines of light shimmered and guided the elixirs to converge at the center.

Clearly, the elixirs merged and clashed, producing pleasing changes as the nascent form of a Pill faintly emerged.

The five masters all widened their eyes, visibly excited.

In all their years of refining, they had never once clearly witnessed a Pill take shape beneath their very eyes.

The Pills they crafted always formed inside the alchemy furnace; the process was invisible to the naked eye, and only when a Pill was completed could its true form be seen...

Until this moment, they had not known that a Pill's formation could be so soul-stirring and magnificent—like the birth of a new life—and that it would emit a vigorous aura of energy.

Emotions surged within the masters; they were nearly speechless, craning their necks as if to draw closer and observe with greater care.

The Pill gradually took on a beautiful shape, and the masters felt their consciousness poured into it, gripped with tension at its birth.

After a long while, a rich aroma of elixir suddenly filled the air, jolting everyone; a weight seemed to lift from their chests, leaving them relaxed and at ease.

Xia Ningshang reached out and scooped the emerging Pill into her hand; her long, fair fingers pinched it as she examined it, brow knitting slightly in mild dissatisfaction, yet she still placed it into a prepared jade vial.

At the same time, Yang Kai produced a Saint Pill; he struck his alchemy furnace with a palm, the Saint Pill shot out and landed precisely into the vial in his hand, which he then sealed.

Two subtly different fragrances of Pill filled the winged chamber, a refreshing and uplifting scent.

Silence reigned in the room; one could hear a pin drop, save for the powerful thudding of five masters' hearts.

Only then did Xia Ningshang return from the refining realm and, upon lifting her head, find five pairs of eyes fixed on her like wolves hunting in the snow.

"Seniors..." Xia Ningshang startled and immediately shot a pleading look toward Yang Kai as she spoke.

Yang Kai grinned, aware that they were still reeling, and said, "Do you masters believe this youngster now?"

Du Wan shot him a glance and smiled wryly, nodding: "Seeing is better than hearing, indeed."

The crowd finally came to their senses; Chang Bao frowned in puzzlement: "But I still can't figure out—without fire or the Yang attribute in her True Yuan, how does she condense medicinal potency? Forgoing the alchemy furnace I could accept, but her True Yuan's nature is wrong."

"I don't quite understand either—could pillcraft not require scorching power?" He Feng kept shaking his head; watching Xia Ningshang had yielded huge gains yet overturned long-held beliefs about pill refinement, leaving them to doubt their own understanding.

Kong Ruoyu looked thoughtful for a long time before saying, "Have any of you heard of a special constitution in this world, one born specifically for pillcraft?"

Du Wan's expression changed; he suddenly remembered and asked, "You mean..."

"The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body?" Hong Fang cried out in surprise.

"Yes, the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body!" Kong Ruoyu's eyes blazed as he looked at Xia Ningshang. "This young girl may very well possess the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body."

"If that's the case, it would explain why she can refine pills without an alchemy furnace or scorching power." Du Wan nodded in agreement.

As top pill-masters, the five had heard of the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body and knew of its miraculous qualities; comparing that with Xia Ningshang's performance only strengthened their conviction.

"Brat, is this your senior sister's constitution special?" Chang Bao asked Yang Kai to confirm.

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

"No wonder—so it's that fabled constitution."

The masters' eyes brightened further as they regarded Xia Ningshang like the greatest treasure of the pillcraft world, their expressions soft with affection.

"You two—senior sister and junior brother—sure know how to hurt people," Du Wan said with endless wryness. "Old man here has lost confidence in pillcraft now."

"Yeah, I feel like I've wasted my life," He Feng lamented, looking utterly defeated.

"But compared honestly, the brat isn't as good as this young girl," Hong Fang laughed. "Both refined Saint-Grade Pills, and in terms of time spent, this girl has the edge."

Yang Kai shrugged. "Can't help it—my senior sister has always been better than me at pill refinement."

"No, junior brother hardly studied pillcraft before—he didn't even know how to refine Pills at first," Xia Ningshang hastily waved her hand.

"Stop flattering each other and get back to refining—there are thirty Pills that must be produced today." Chang Bao couldn't wait to watch more and urged them on.

"Right, but fair warning: after being put down like that, us old geezers won't refine anything today so we don't waste herbs," He Feng added.

"Fine then, today's thirty Pills will be left to me and little senior sister," Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang exchanged a knowing smile and fell silent, throwing themselves back into the work.

Time passed.

The five masters lingered around Xia Ningshang, missing none of her hand movements, while Yang Kai drew little attention.

They had watched Yang Kai refine Pills for some time; now that Xia Ningshang was present, they were unwilling to miss these new techniques.

Yang Kai was perfectly content with this, and Xia Ningshang was even more joyful.

She had little experience with Saint-Grade materials before, but now that she had come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, resources were no longer a concern, and she worked tirelessly.

Moreover, with the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body she possessed, her refinement advanced far faster than the gains from meditation or training ever could.

Xia Ningshang herself had said before that refining Pills was her cultivation; she never felt fatigue.

They labored until dusk; the thirty Pills were finally completed. Yang Kai felt mentally drained, while Xia Ningshang remained radiant, as if wanting more.

Xu Hui came and took the thirty Pills away, exiting the Sacred Land to hand them to the martial artists waiting outside the Nine Peaks.

Those cultivators were full of praise, lauding the Sacred Land’s Masters for their remarkable skill. After just ten days of rest, the amount of Pills they could refine had suddenly increased by a great margin.

This delighted the people waiting in line for Pills.

With the Sacred Land's masters producing more Pills each day, the waiting time for those seeking elixirs would be shortened.

At this moment, Yang Kai, Xia Ningshang, and the five masters had all returned to their rooms to meditate and absorb what they'd learned that day.

The next day, they continued the same.

It was not until three days later that the five masters began to personally refine Pills, putting their insights into practice.

The winged chamber was perpetually filled with the scent of elixir; Spirit-Grade Pills and Saint-Grade Pills came off the line one after another, a joyful scene.
