## Chapter 1903 — Speak Plainly

One hundred Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills a year completely stunned everyone present.

This was an offer no one could refuse; many alchemists from the Hengluo Commerce Guild were already giving Ai Ou subtle signals, urging him to agree quickly and not hesitate.

They pressed Ai Ou like this partly for the guild's interests and partly for their own benefit.

If this went through, Master Zuo De would surely remain in Shuitian City, and they would have opportunities to interact with and learn from Master Zuo De.

But Ai Ou did not comply with their wishes.

Zuo De's face darkened; he had put the matter to this point yet still received no direct answer from Ai Ou, which surprised and angered him. "Chairman Ai Ou, could it be that… this old man lacks sincerity?" he pressed, "Or perhaps Chairman Ai Ou thinks this old man's granddaughter is not worthy of the Third Young Master?"

A thin bead of cold sweat appeared on Ai Ou's brow. He hastily waved his hand and said, "Of course not. Miss Ling'er is such an extraordinary lady; for her to take a fancy to Xue Yue is a blessing this boy could only have earned over several lifetimes — how could she be unworthy?"

"If that's the case, Chairman Ai Ou, what are you still hesitating for?" Zhan Yuan said to Ai Ou. "The Third Young Master is a man of noble bearing and Miss Ling'er is peerlessly beautiful — they're a perfect match, made by Heaven and Earth!"

Ai Ou shot Zhan Yuan a cold glance, wishing he could slap the man dead.

Why had he never found this fellow so irritating before? The more he looked at him today, the more unbearable he found him.

Although Ai Ou felt averse, out of deference to Zuo De he had no choice but to call Zhan Yuan "Master" — in the past he had addressed him by name — and could only say, "It's just…"

Zuo De's voice turned extremely cold, carrying an intimidating edge. "Just what?" he demanded.

"Just…"

Seeing his father in an awkward position, Xue Yue stepped forward, clasped her fists, and said, "If Master forgives me, the matter is actually Xue Yue's own. Xue Yue already has someone in her heart; she has long promised to remain by that person's side and never abandon them. I beg the Master to forgive me!"

At her words, Zuo Ling swayed, her pretty face gone pale as she stared at Xue Yue, her eyes reddening as if tears were about to fall.

Xue Yue turned and looked at Zuo Ling. "Sister Ling'er, we've known each other since childhood. Although we haven't spent much time together, I have always regarded you as my sister and harbor no other feelings toward you. Sister, your affection… please forgive Xue Yue for being unworthy of it!"

Already overwhelmed with grievance, Zuo Ling burst into loud sobs, her tears like pear blossoms caught in rain — pitiful to hear and heartbreaking to see.

Many people showed looks of sympathy.

Zuo De's old face turned so dark it might as well have been a sheet of frost.

"I don't care, I don't care!" Zuo Ling suddenly grabbed Zuo De's arm and shook him, sobbing as she did. "All I want is to be with Brother Xue Yue. Grandpa, please think of a way — aren't you all‑powerful? Hurry and think of something! If I can't marry Brother Xue Yue, Ling'er... Ling'er will not live!"

Seeing Zuo Ling act so recklessly, everyone understood she had been spoiled by Zuo De; otherwise a young lady would not speak so thoughtlessly in public.

Zuo De looked both pained and helpless; he patted the back of Zuo Ling's hand and comforted her, "Stop crying. If you keep crying, I'll leave now and never come back to Shuitian City, and you'll never see the Third Young Master again!"

The trick worked. Zuo Ling immediately stopped crying, though she still sobbed and could not hide her choking emotions, her delicate shoulders heaving as she glared at Xue Yue with silent grievance.

Xue Yue felt helpless inside; she turned her gaze away, knowing that now was a time for cutting decisions, not softening.

Ai Ou's heart sank. With his shrewdness he could tell Zuo De's earlier words were meant to comfort Zuo Ling while actually threatening Ai Ou.

The implication was obvious: if he could not satisfy the old man's granddaughter, Zuo De would leave Shuitian City and never set foot there again.

That meant the Hengluo Commerce Guild would lose its only Guest Elder who was a Void King-Grade alchemist — a blow not only to the guild's interests but to its reputation as well.

If that happened, could the guild still hire Void King-Grade alchemists or artificers?

The answer was clearly no, unless they cultivated one themselves. But producing a Void King-Grade alchemist or artificer was no easy task; the birth of such a practitioner was even harder than a martial artist ascending to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Otherwise, peak alchemists and artificers would not be so rare in the world, and Ai Ou would not have to swallow his pride and put on a smiling face while being humiliated by Zuo De.

Ai Ou suddenly felt this was the most stifling day of his life.

Zuo De eased his tone and said, "Chairman Ai Ou, you see this girl is acting wilfully and I truly have no way to manage her, but since the Third Young Master already has someone in his heart, I cannot force the matter and break them apart — that would bring me a thousand curses. So here's what we'll do: I'll give you and the Third Young Master a few days to think it over and then reply to me. During these days I'll stay in Shuitian City with Ling'er. When you decide, come and find me."

He was confident Ai Ou urgently wanted him to refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, which was why he spoke in this way.

Sure enough, Ai Ou looked troubled and wanted to ask Zuo De to first refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, but he could not bring himself to open his mouth; he also knew that even if he shamelessly asked, Zuo De would certainly find excuses to decline.

For example, he could claim he was in a bad mood, or that Zuo Ling was interfering...

Better to remain silent than make a fool of himself.

His gaze fell on Xue Yue as he considered whether to first agree to Zuo De's terms, get Gu Bihu healed, and then deal with the aftermath.

But Xue Yue was after all a woman; to agree now would mean thoroughly offending Zuo De.

Ai Ou felt his head spin; he had never been put in such an awkward position. As head of the Hengluo Commerce Guild he was decisive and had led the guild to prosperity, but facing Zuo De's marriage proposal he was at a loss.

"I've long heard of Master Zuo De's renown; I have admired him for years, but seeing him in person today, tsk tsk…"

Just as Ai Ou was inwardly cursing, a voice suddenly rang out.

He jolted and turned toward the sound; when he saw who had spoken he froze in place and frowned.

Because the speaker was Yang Kai!

Yang Kai and Xue Yue were quite close; him stepping forward now was clearly to defend Xue Yue, but his words were somewhat excessive and would surely offend Zuo De.

Yet he was not of the Hengluo Commerce Guild and did not represent the guild, so however much he offended Zuo De it would not implicate the guild.

Thinking this, Ai Ou suddenly realized Yang Kai was the most fitting person to speak and brightened as he gave him a signaling look.

Others' expressions also shifted; though Yang Kai had not finished speaking, everyone heard the scorn in his words.

To say such things to the face of a Void King-Grade alchemist was like slapping him in the face; many Origin-Grade alchemists' gazes toward Yang Kai turned sour.

Zuo De still kept his composure and did not immediately fly into a rage. He narrowed his eyes and said, "Chairman Ai Ou, this gentleman is…"

"Master, Yang Kai is my friend," Xue Yue interjected before Ai Ou could answer.

"Also of the Commerce Guild?" Zuo De frowned.

"No. He was merely passing by and came to see me," Xue Yue explained.

Zuo De nodded and smiled faintly. "Your earlier words, I cannot simply ignore them. You seem to harbor some discontent toward me? Have I offended you before?"

From Zhan Yuan, Zuo De learned that Yang Kai had been saying things about him behind his back — nothing vicious, merely that he was a bit full of himself. Zuo De filed it away in his mind and quietly resolved he would not refine any Void King‑Grade Spiritual Pills for the man in future. It was a minor grievance and not worth picking a fight over, so he let it drop. Now, however, Yang Kai had the nerve to step forward again and prod at his sore spot — that he could not simply laugh off.

A Second Stage Void King martial artist — what of it? When they needed something, wouldn't they still have to come begging him. Zuo De thought this proudly.

"Master jokes," Yang Kai said calmly, "This is our first meeting — how could there be any offense?"

"If that is so, then why did you…"

“Speak plainly—what’s the issue?” Yang Kai asked with a relaxed smile.

Zuo De's face darkened; just as he was about to speak, Yang Kai cut in: "An alchemist is like a physician — a healer must pair skill with compassion; lacking either is unforgivable. Madam Gu's soul has been damaged for a year and her life hangs by a thread. Since Master is here, why not light the furnace and refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill to save her? Yet you insist on using your granddaughter's marriage as a bargaining chip to coerce Chairman Ai Ou and the Third Young Master — proof that while your technique is superb, your benevolence is a bit lacking... tsk tsk. Do you truly deserve the character 'Master'? It must sit heavy on your head — don't you feel the weight? You're advanced in years, Master, don't let it crush you."

He had never expected Yang Kai's words to be so sharp — they were nearly a public rupture with Zuo De.

Although Yang Kai's words hit a nerve and he agreed with them utterly, to say such things in front of Zuo De was to offend him to the death. Even if it was the truth and everyone knew it, some things were better left unsaid.

Some things are better left unspoken — it's enough that everyone understands.

Zuo De's face flushed and paled in turns; he found himself unable to preserve face. No one had ever dared speak to him like that — even Void King-Stage martial artists were respectful in his presence — when had anyone heard such a razor-sharp rebuke?

Yang Kai's words seemed to weigh on his shoulders like a heavy load.
