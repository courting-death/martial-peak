## Chapter 1106 — Aboard the Thief's Ship

When Yang Kai said so many high-grade materials were under her control and could be freely forged, Yang Flame immediately perked up; a fierce light blazed in her eyes as she rubbed at the corners of her eyes, drew a deep breath and declared, "I won't let you down. Any materials that come into my hands will never be wasted!"

“I’ll be waiting to see.”

"Where did you get so many materials? You're not that powerful — there's no way you could have slain so many Eighth-Tier demonic beasts," Yang Flame asked again, curiosity piqued.

"Picked them up," Yang Kai replied offhandedly.

It was sort of picking them up; these items had been obtained by Guiche and the others while hunting demonic beasts. They originally belonged to several people, but after those people died, Yang Kai had taken their Spatial Rings.

"Where did you pick them up? I want to go pick some too..." Yang Flame's expression brightened and she looked at Yang Kai with longing in her eyes.

Following Yang Flame's instructions and clutching the list she had written, Yang Kai made another trip to Tianyun City and bought a great deal of ore.

After all, forging artifacts didn't only require parts of demonic beasts' bodies; various ores were also necessities.

Once he secured those ores, Yang Flame immediately threw herself into the work of forging. The stone chamber she lived in was sealed off completely; she made it obvious she did not want to be disturbed.

Yang Kai could clearly sense that every day strong Yang-attribute energy fluctuations issued from her chamber, though he did not pry into the specific progress.

He only cared about the results; from the results he could judge Yang Flame's skill.

The materials he had taken out before were ones Yang Kai assumed he couldn't use and would just sell. If Yang Flame could truly refine them into Secret Treasures, their value would rise and selling them later would net far more Saint Crystals; if she ruined them it wouldn't matter — Yang Kai wasn't short on such things.

A whole month passed quietly. Without Yang Flame's interruptions, Yang Kai led an exceptionally leisurely life. The formation on Dragon Lair Mountain was constantly in effect; faint mists had begun to appear in the sky above the mountain, a sign that Spiritual Qi was gathering. Though not dense, the mists made Dragon Lair Mountain look somewhat like a sacred mountain.

Given time, the Spiritual Qi here would grow ever more abundant. Ever richer.

Wu Yi did come by twice; she seemed unhappy at home and did little when she visited, merely chatting with Yang Kai to ease her mood.

After a month, while Yang Kai was meditating in the stone chamber, he suddenly heard the door of Yang Flame's sealing chamber open, followed by quick, hurried footsteps heading his way.

Looking up, he saw Yang Flame's face flushed; she held up her wide black robe in both hands, panting as she stood in the doorway and looked at Yang Kai with excitement — the expression of someone whose expectations had been met.

"May I come in?" Yang Flame peered in nervously and asked. Ever since the day she barged in uninvited and angered Yang Kai — after he had grabbed her by the neck and tossed her out — she no longer dared to enter the chamber at will.

Yang Kai nodded, and, unable to hide a little anticipation, asked, "Finished forging?"

Yang Flame smiled without answering and said mysteriously, "Close your eyes — I have a surprise for you!"

If she said it outright, what surprise was there? Yang Kai's expression turned odd, but he obliged and closed his eyes.

The next moment his face changed. Waves of energy belonging to Saint King-Grade Secret Treasures suddenly rolled through the stone chamber. He opened his eyes to see Yang Flame posing proudly, pointing at several Secret Treasures neatly arranged before them.

“The materials you provided and the ores you bought—I didn’t waste any of them. All the results are here: a total of four Saint King-Grade Secret Treasures.”
Yang Flame sat cross-legged and, as if presenting treasures, picked up a Secret Treasure shaped like a spiked club. “Let me introduce them to you. This one was refined using the teeth of an Eighth-Tier Demonic Beast, the Thunder Cloud Leopard, combined with ores for the shaft. I also fused the Thunder Cloud Leopard’s skull into it. The beast’s teeth are tough and razor-sharp, so I refined them into the barbs along the head. Such a rough and imposing weapon suits a burly man with broad shoulders and a thick waist. Anyone wielding it would look quite formidable. Mm, it’s a Saint King-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure!”

Having said that, she handed the wolf-tooth club to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai examined it carefully and nodded slightly. It was clear Yang Flame had made full use of the materials and forged the item well; if it found the right owner, it would not be difficult for it to display its power.

"This dagger was tempered from the horn of a Scorchfire Biyan Rhinoceros. It's not very sharp, but the horn itself has peculiar properties that are excellent for breaking barrier-type restrictions. So its use isn't primarily for killing enemies but for exploring dangerous places — a must-have for such ventures. I think many people would buy it. It's also a Saint King-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure." Yang Flame said as she handed Yang Kai a dagger that shimmered with a faint bluish light.

She then picked up another item and explained, "This soft whip was forged mainly from the tendrils of an Adamant Dragon Beetle. It was the hardest to make — one slip and the materials could be ruined. Fortunately I handled it; if another artificer had tried, you'd be crying now. This is suitable for girls. Since you obtained those tendrils, you should know how terrifying the Adamant Dragon Beetle is. I'll tell you: if struck by this whip, it wounds more than skin — it harms sinew and bone; repeated blows can even break bones. This is a Saint King-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure!"

Yang Kai took the soft whip from her and poured True Yuan into it, cracking it a few times. The chamber instantly filled with overlapping whip shadows, making Yang Flame turn pale with fright lest Yang Kai accidentally lash her.

Only after Yang Kai put the whip away did she, ecstatic, carefully pick up the final Secret Treasure. She handled it as if it were a work of art; her eyes were filled with infatuation.

"This is the piece I'm most proud of this time!"

Yang Kai looked and found the piece was nothing more than a pair of palm-sized wings, their surfaces shimmering with entrancing light and shifting colors — exceptionally beautiful.

No doubt these wings had been forged from the wings of an Illusory Cloud Butterfly, and they were the highest-grade of the lot — a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure!

"With the materials you provided I could only have forged a Saint King-Grade Middle-Level item, but I managed to push its grade up a full level. Oh my, I've long wanted to forge a pair of wing-shaped Secret Treasures but could never find suitable materials." Yang Flame cradled the wings and inspected them from every angle, growing increasingly pleased. She kept them from handing them over to Yang Kai right away, glancing at him from time to time with a look whose meaning any blind man could read.

Yang Kai reached out a hand; only then did Yang Flame, reluctantly and anxiously, place the wings in his palm and warn, "Be careful — don't break them."

"They're mine, right?" Yang Kai asked with amusement.

"They're yours, yes, but I forged them, so I have a responsibility to protect them. You're so careless..."

"A Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure — so fragile it can be broken that easily?" Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Yang Flame opened her mouth but didn't know what to say, and instead backpedaled, "Although there's a Star Shuttle for travel, in combat these wings can increase a martial artist's speed and can even be used defensively at key moments. They're worth at least thirty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals. If you auction them, they'll fetch an even higher price — perhaps forty thousand; there are so many rich people in this world, it's infuriating!"

As she spoke she waved her small fists, seeming genuinely vexed by her own poverty.

"Thirty thousand?" Yang Kai frowned, remembering he had paid twelve thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals for a Star Shuttle of the same grade when buying it on Shuiyue Star.

Although of the same grade, the winged Secret Treasure's value was undoubtedly much greater than a Star Shuttle. Such a price was not surprising — its appearance was exceptionally beautiful, and many men would gladly pay a high price to present it to a favored woman.

"Thirty thousand — would you buy it?" Yang Kai asked Yang Flame.

Yang Flame nodded her head quickly like a pecking chick.

"It's yours then," Yang Kai said casually and tossed the wings back to her.

Yang Flame caught them dumbly and stared for a long moment before blushing deeply and confessing, "I don't have that many Saint Crystals..."

Her face flushed red.

"I know. You don't need to pay immediately — leave it as a debt. I'll still ask you to forge for me; you can deduct your wages from that thirty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals. Once it's paid off, you're free. Until then, consider yourself my exclusive artificer."

“Thirty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals as payment?” Yang Flame was startled. “Do you have any idea how much I should be charging for refining these Secret Treasures for you?”

"How much?"

"I was planning to charge you a thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals a month... that's my month's fee. Thirty thousand means I'd have to toil nonstop for thirty months — two and a half years!" Her face went deathly pale; she couldn't help but feel she'd boarded a thief's ship.

"Two and a half years isn't long; there will come a time it'll be paid off."

"What if it never gets paid off?" Yang Flame was nearly in tears. She had never possessed so many Saint Crystals and couldn't imagine what thirty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals even meant.

"Then prepare to give yourself to me," Yang Kai grinned wickedly, leering over her proud figure. "Not bad — I do like your type."

Yang Flame turned even paler and looked at the wings in her hands. Part of her wanted to smash them hard into Yang Kai's lecherous face, but she couldn't bear to.

After a moment's thought she suddenly grew serious, "Let me ask plainly: do you have enough materials for me to keep forging for you? If my wages are to be taken from this debt, you must keep supplying me materials. If you don't ask me to forge Secret Treasures for years, when on earth will I ever be free?"

The little girl wasn't stupid. Yang Kai had planned to cement his role as creditor, but Yang Flame, who had seemed silly, suddenly grew shrewd.

"Don't worry about materials — take these to forge with." Yang Kai said as he produced another large pile of materials and set them before Yang Flame.
