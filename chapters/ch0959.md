## Chapter 959 — My Man

Changyuan didn't seem intent on killing this demon, nor did he seek to break his bones; he merely tormented him, forcing him to endure unbearable flesh-and-skin suffering until he submitted and served him.

So although the injuries the demon had suffered looked grave, they were not truly fatal—he had merely grown extremely weak after being trapped here for months.

After taking the Wan Yao Ling Milk, with his constitution he would recover in a dozen or so days.

Yang Kai inhaled deeply and his expression relaxed.

"Saint Lord..." A figure suddenly appeared beside Yang Kai in a strange way; the Demon Lord Changyuan emerged leisurely, his face bitter as he looked at Yang Kai and forced a dry laugh. "You came straight into the demon palace and laid hands on my man—surely that's not proper. Did you ask your host first?"

"Your man?" Yang Kai sat up straight, his gaze turning cold and malignant. He glared and sneered, "He is my man!"

Changyuan's brow furrowed; he looked at Yang Kai in puzzlement. "Saint Lord, what do you mean by that? I don't quite understand—have you mistaken someone? He..."

"His body used to belong to a former demon general, but the soul inside is my friend!" Yang Kai cut him off before he could finish, giving the demon lord no face.

Changyuan’s expression shifted, and he said in surprise, “So Saint Lord Yang already knew about this!”

"We'll settle accounts later!" Yang Kai ground his teeth, bent down, lifted the demon from the ground, and, slanting his eyes at Changyuan, said, "Find a place for him—I'll heal his wounds."

Changyuan forced a bitter smile and hurriedly nodded.

He had already seen through it: Yang Kai was not speaking at random. It wasn't baseless—there might indeed be a connection between the soul hidden in that former demon general's body and Yang Kai.

And the connection was not shallow.

Full of inward resentment, Changyuan nonetheless cooperated and arranged a side chamber for Yang Kai.

Inside the chamber the demon lay on the bed while Li Rong and Han Fei continuously poured demonic essence into his body to aid his recovery.

Changyuan watched for a while, found it rather dull, and picked a casual excuse to leave.

Stepping out of the Demon Palace, Yang Kai and the others found the Demon at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm who had led them there earlier still waiting outside. Upon seeing Changyuan, that Demon immediately bowed respectfully.

"Send word to Gou Qiong and the others—tell them to come to the Demon Capital at once. I want to see them within ten days!" Changyuan ordered in a grave voice.

"Yes!" The demon accepted the command and immediately departed.

After he left, Changyuan cast one more glance at the towering demon palace. His gleaming eyes could scarcely hide his excitement; the corners of his mouth twitched faintly.

Yang Kai had come, bearing the Demon God's Secret Codex—this meant the mystery that had plagued him for centuries might finally be solved! It had been Changyuan's wish since becoming Demon Lord. Now that they had reached the critical moment, how could he not be thrilled?

"No major harm—he should awaken in about half a day!" Li Rong and Han Fei withdrew their hands and stopped pouring demonic essence into him, nodding lightly to Yang Kai.

"Mm." Yang Kai replied, his gaze complicated as he looked at the demon before him; he had not expected that someone he thought least likely to be a concern would sink to such a state.

"Master... this man..." Li Rong looked at Yang Kai with curiosity, puzzled why he took this demon so seriously.

Yang Kai smiled. "His name is Di Mo."

"I just heard this body belongs to a demon general from long ago?"

"That's right. Di Mo originally had only a wisp of a remnant soul, then by coincidence he obtained an intact demon general's body. His spirit entered and seized the shell." Yang Kai promptly explained.

Li Rong and Han Fei nodded repeatedly as they listened, then finally understood the relationship between Yang Kai and Di Mo.

When Yang Kai had been very small and weak, Di Mo had accompanied him and helped him many times. Although at first they distrusted each other and harbored hidden murderous intent, over time, through sincere cooperation, they came to trust one another. Even after Di Mo regained his freedom, he did not leave Yang Kai.

Di Mo was grateful to Yang Kai for granting him a second life, and Yang Kai was likewise grateful for the help he had received.

As they spoke, Di Mo suddenly opened his eyes and laboriously shouted, "Young Master, Old Mo is here!"

Yang Kai's spirit stirred; he hurriedly looked toward him and asked with concern, "How do you feel?"

"Not good!" Di Mo pouted, his face full of indignation.

Meng Wuya laughed heartily. "You old demon, how did you end up like this? If Yang Kai and I hadn't happened to come here today, you'd still be taking that flesh-and-skin suffering!"

"Damn it—when I reach the Third Stage of the Saint Realm I'll twist Changyuan's head off and use it as a chamber pot, or I won't have avenged this hatred!" Di Mo cursed between gasps.

"If you have that ability, feel free to try—I'll be waiting!" Changyuan strolled in with a smiling face, acting as if nothing had happened.

Yang Kai looked at him with a frigid gaze.

Changyuan said leisurely, "Saint Lord, please don't blame me—I truly did not know he was your man. I admit I wronged him earlier. Very well, here I offer my apologies to this brother."

Saying that, he continued as if to himself, "In truth I bore him no malice; I only wanted him to submit to me. I did not expect him to have such stubborn pride. Had he told me earlier that he belonged to Saint Lord, I would never have treated him this way. As you've seen, though he suffered flesh wounds he has no broken bones. I do appreciate talent."

Di Mo emitted a raucous, strange laugh. "Today I'm weaker than you—do what you want. When my strength surpasses yours in the future, I'll show you my power!"

Changyuan raised an eyebrow. "Brother, you should worry more about how to make your soul and this body perfectly compatible. In your condition, within twenty years the body will surely deteriorate! Then you'll have to find a new vessel and start cultivation over again. When will you be strong enough to twist off my head?"

At his words Di Mo's face darkened.

Though unwilling to admit it, there was truth in Changyuan's words.

When he first obtained the demon general's body he had told Yang Kai that there would be no major problems within thirty years; however, if in that time he failed to make his spirit and body perfectly coordinate, he would have to seize another host.

More than a decade had already passed, and the Demon Lord's sharp eye had immediately seen Di Mo's future troubles.

"Saint Lord, though I have acted wrongly, this brother's body is the body of one of my demon tribe's generals from long ago. By rights, as leader of the demon clan I should reclaim it. For that reason I wanted him to submit. But if he truly belongs to Saint Lord, then let us call the matter even—this body will be given to Saint Lord, and Saint Lord should not hold my earlier treatment of him against me."

Changyuan spoke earnestly. Yang Kai frowned and glanced at Di Mo. "If you're feeling resentful, I'll tear this Demon Capital apart for you!"

At those words Changyuan's face changed drastically. "Saint Lord, you must be joking."

Yang Kai turned his head away and looked at him coldly. "Do I look like I'm joking?"

Meng Wuya, Li Rong, and Han Fei all fixed him with hostile stares.

Changyuan immediately felt as if a mountain pressed down upon him. Although his power and cultivation were profound and his means world-shaking, a single Meng Wuya or a single Li Rong made him uneasy; if the two of them acted together, he could not possibly withstand them.

If they truly fought, the Demon Capital would likely be torn apart.

His face turned grave in an instant; he looked at Di Mo with a hint of nervousness, fearful that some careless word might slip from him.

"Thank you for your kindness, Young Master, for today’s humiliation I shall repay in time—there's no need for Young Master to intervene!" Di Mo grinned ferociously.

Changyuan's expression suddenly relaxed.

Yang Kai nodded and said no more.

"I'll send for some tonic supplies," Changyuan said, then hurried away.

As Demon Lord, he had not been threatened like this for many years—he had never felt such humiliation. Had he not needed Yang Kai's Demon God's Secret Codex to unlock the Great Demon God's long-hidden secret, he would never have swallowed his pride like this!

A Demon Lord naturally had his pride.

Before long, maidservants brought some rare heaven-and-earth treasures to the demon palace to help Di Mo recuperate his qi and blood.

Di Mo was extremely satisfied. After chatting with Yang Kai and the others he recounted the events of his past decade.

After arriving on the Tongxuan Continent with Meng Wuya and the others, Di Mo separated from them. Having taken over the demon general's body, it was too dangerous to operate on human territory, so he traveled alone into the Demon Domain.

Over the following ten years he concealed his identity and trained diligently; his strength rose rapidly.

After all, he already possessed the foundation of a supreme expert, and the body he occupied had once belonged to a top-tier master. Everything was in place—he only needed to accumulate Heaven-and-Earth Energy in his body; when the time came his power would naturally increase, with no real bottleneck.

Over more than ten years his power gradually recovered to the peak of the First Stage of the Saint Realm.

But despite his caution, a flaw was discovered.

Someone recognized him as the missing demon general from those years and reported him to the Demon Lord. The Demon Lord personally intervened, brought him back to the demon palace, and ordered him to submit and swear fealty. Di Mo resisted to the death and was nailed to that stone pillar.

A few months later Yang Kai came here.

After hearing his tale, Yang Kai and Meng Wuya exchanged glances, both somewhat surprised—none of them expected Di Mo to be so principled.

"Young Master, how are you? And how did you find this place?" Di Mo began asking about Yang Kai's experiences.

Yang Kai told his story in measured detail.

Compared with Di Mo's experiences, Yang Kai's ordeals were far grander in scope; many things were new even to Li Rong and the others, who listened with great interest.

When he learned that Ling Taixu had also come to the Tongxuan Continent, Di Mo's face showed a trace of pleasure.

Upon learning of the great changes in the world and the Bone Race's revival, Di Mo's expression turned strange and he asked in a low voice, "Young Master, the Bone Race you speak of—are they the type made entirely of bones, who can draw upon the flesh-and-blood essences of the dead to craft their bodies?"

"Yes!" Yang Kai's body trembled as he looked at Di Mo in surprise. "You have seen them?"

Di Mo shook his head. "But I have an impression—I should have crossed paths with that race before!"
