## Chapter 567 — Heavenly Journey Palace

Under the might of the Overlord King, all defenses in the world are as illusory as shadows.

His power had reached a profound realm — the pure sublimation of force itself.

When the Overlord King swung his fist, the other four Evil Kings watched leisurely, seemingly convinced that the barrier forged by Meng Wuya could not withstand the Overlord King’s ferocious assault.

They had absolute confidence in the Force King.

But the result astonished them greatly.

Where the Force King's fist struck, only a faint ripple appeared; the palace-like barrier enveloping Yang Kai's residence remained utterly unscathed.

Instead, the Overlord King was blasted backward by the rebound of his own force, tumbling midair for hundreds of zhang before barely regaining his stance.

The four Evil Kings’ eyes widened in disbelief, jaws agape, stunned beyond words.

They had never before witnessed the Force King fail at a strike. Though bulky and coarse in appearance, his strength ranked high among the six, with even the Poison King and Ghost King reluctant to engage him lightly.

That punch he threw, though not his full strength, was astounding—yet it failed to pierce the barrier?

A subtle unease spread among the Evil Kings.

Meanwhile, inside Yang Kai’s residence, everyone involuntarily exhaled in relief. Meng Wuya claimed their safety was guaranteed, but until danger truly came, no one dared believe it wholeheartedly.

Seeing the Force King take such a blow, they gained some confidence in Meng Wuya’s defense, and their tense hearts relaxed considerably.

The Overlord King slowly staggered back from hundreds of zhang away, stopping before Yang Kai’s residence. He gazed dumbfounded at the transparent palace barrier, frustration etched across his face.

The Ghost King chuckled mockingly, “Force King, perhaps you didn’t eat enough before coming and couldn’t unleash your real strength.”

The Poison King sneered harshly, “Looks like Force King’s strength only reaches this point after all.”

They seemed delighted to see the Overlord King suffer, their expressions full of schadenfreude.

“Nonsense!” the Overlord King bellowed like thunder. “There’s something strange about this barrier.”

As he spoke, he rotated his fists again, cursing incessantly. Suddenly, he roared, and his vitality and blood Qi surged rapidly.

The Poison King and Ghost King ceased their taunts, their expressions turning grave. They understood that the Force King was going all out now.

His previous punch probably only harnessed about half of his power; now, he clearly aimed to unleash his full might.

Such a blow would make anyone dodge its fury.

Would this punch break the barrier? The Evil Kings secretly awaited the outcome.

Suddenly, the Force King struck again. This time, his punch was vastly different from the previous lightning-fast strike—it floated lightly, moved slowly, so clearly a child of three could discern its path.

Yet, where his fist passed, space was torn asunder, the heavens and earth humming ominously.

When his fist gently touched the palace barrier, an unparalleled force erupted.

A ripple radiated out, noticeably larger than before, yet still limited in scale.

With a miserable cry, the Overlord King was blasted backward like an arrow released from a bow, vanishing from sight in a flash.

The Poison King, Shadow King, Beast King, and Ghost King stared blankly.

Inside Yang Kai’s residence, those holding their breath now burst into cheers, as though their tightly wound nerves were suddenly released in jubilation.

“This barrier… is extraordinary,” the Poison King remarked at last, voice grave.

“That Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure is no easy thing,” the Ghost King added, his gaze burning as he fixed on Meng Wuya amidst the crowd.

Even at full strength, the Force King hadn’t shattered the barrier erected by that Secret Treasure. What kind of formidable background did this old man wield?

After some time, the Overlord King finally returned, though a streak of crimson blood marked the corner of his mouth. The force rebounding from the barrier had even he struggled to endure.

“Damn it! I refuse to believe there’s a barrier in this world I can’t break!” the Overlord King grumbled sourly.

“Force King, enough. This can’t be breached by brute force alone,” warned the Poison King.

“Shut up!” the Overlord King snapped in irritation, determined not to relent unless he shattered the barrier. Striding quickly toward the shield, he prepared to strike again.

“Fool!” sneered the Yinming Ghost King derisively.

Among the Evil Kings, though the Overlord King’s strength was exceptional, his mind was straightforward and stubborn. Once he fixed on a goal, no one could dissuade him except their Evil Lord, Yang Bai.

With their lord absent, the others no longer tried to stop him.

At the third strike, the Force King’s expression grew much more solemn, as if dealing with something of utmost importance.

At the moment his fist neared the barrier, countless fist shadows emerged, crashing toward its surface with a thunderous impact.

At the very instant, the barrier before the Force King split open a slit of its own accord.

A strange smile curled on Meng Wuya’s lips.

The Force King looked stunned, momentarily losing control of his momentum and stumbling into the gap in the barrier. It swiftly sealed behind him.

Simultaneously, flashes of lightning sparked, and a figure darted beside the Force King, snatching him out of the barrier just in the nick of time.

When the barrier closed, the Overlord King had already appeared dozens of zhang away, held in the hand of the Lightning Shadow King.

“So fast!” Meng Wuya’s eyes narrowed as he glanced intently at Lightning Shadow King. Even he had barely discerned Shadow King’s move.

Yang Kai blinked, suddenly realizing what had occurred.

That scene was evidently Meng Wuya’s plan to trap the Force King within the barrier.

Since Meng Wuya created the barrier, he could control everything inside, including countermeasures against intruders. If they could eliminate an Evil King here, it would greatly shift the situation.

Unfortunately, Lightning Shadow King acted swiftly, retrieving the Overlord King before the barrier fully sealed.

Yang Kai sighed softly, feeling the loss keenly.

“So you dare to cheat?” the Overlord King loudly demanded, disbelief on his face as he turned to Shadow King. “Why did you pull me back? If I’d gone in, I could’ve wiped them all out.”

“You couldn’t,” Lightning Shadow King replied coldly. “If you went in, you would die.”

Given their actions, the others could tell they had confidence in this.

Only the Force King was reckless, believing it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Hearing this, the Force King stopped arguing, grumbling, “This turtle shell’s really tough; I’m out of options.”

Brute force alone couldn’t break it.

“We’ll try,” said the Poison King and Ghost King with icy smiles, unleashing poison mist and ghostly faces that covered Yang Kai’s residence in an instant.

Those hiding inside watched the green haze fill the sky and heard the dreadful howls, touched deeply.

But the poison mist and ghostly faces were all blocked by the barrier, impenetrable and seamless. No matter how hard Ghost King and Poison King tried, they could find no crack.

After some time, Poison King and Ghost King withdrew, exchanging cold glances and shaking their heads.

They too had no solution.

The Ghost King mused, “Our lord is nearly here. Let’s not waste time. They hide inside refusing to come out, but someday we’ll have our chance. Let’s clear out the other trash first.”

“Agreed,” Poison King nodded. “When our lord comes, this barrier will surely fall.”

The five Evil Kings exchanged looks and vanished quickly. Even the enormous Spider Mother followed the Thunder Beast King into battle.

Only after their departure did those in the residence finally lower their guard.

Yang Kai glanced at Meng Wuya. “Shopkeeper Meng, can this barrier withstand the Evil Lord?”

Meng Wuya replied proudly, “No one can break my Heavenly Journey Palace. What’s the Evil Lord?”

“Heavenly Journey Palace?” Ling Taixu raised an eyebrow. “A fitting name for a Secret Treasure, indeed. No wonder you’re so confident, to possess such a Secret Treasure.”

With the Heavenly Journey Palace protecting them, those inside were utterly safe.

“How long can such a barrier last?” Yang Kai asked worriedly.

“Unlimited.”

Yang Kai gasped, realizing the true might of the Heavenly Journey Palace.

Though secure inside, he wore a slight frown. He could not spend his life hidden here. Looking toward Zhongdu, unease crept in.

The news of the Cangyun Evil Land’s invasion must have reached Zhongdu by now, but Yang Kai had no idea how they would resist or what results the battle would bring.

Though his parents were strong now, they were still leagues behind the Evil Kings.

War City was destroyed, its people slaughtered.

After the Five Great Evil Kings led massive bands of Demonic Beasts to lay siege to War City, within an hour, there was no one alive there except those inside Yang Kai’s residence.

Even those who had fled were hunted down by the Evil Kings and Demonic Beasts.

Only a handful of elites escaped safely back to Zhongdu.

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai felt relieved.

Thanks to Meng Wuya’s Heavenly Journey Palace, if it were not for him, whether the household fled or stayed in War City, the losses would have been catastrophic.

As Meng Wuya said, if they had left earlier, at most ten percent would have survived.

The heavy blow from Cangyun Evil Land caught the Eight Great Families completely unprepared.

As dusk fell, countless warriors from Cangyun Evil Land arrived at War City under the command of Evil Lord Yang Bai, accompanied by the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo.

Seeing the ravaged city, rivers of blood, and mountains of corpses, Shan Qingluo showed a trace of sorrow and impatience.

Her sensing revealed Yang Kai motionless, and she worried whether he had been captured.

After meeting the five Evil Kings and hearing their report to Yang Bai, Shan Qingluo breathed a sigh of relief.

“The barrier you five couldn’t break?” Yang Bai looked at the Evil Kings with displeasure.

Their faces fell awkwardly. Poison King replied, “My lord, that barrier is peculiar. We couldn’t handle it. Perhaps only you can break it in the world.”
