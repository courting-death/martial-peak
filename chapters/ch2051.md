## Chapter 2051 — Jade Slip

The cavern was vast; besides that magma pool, there were other things as well.

Yang Kai had not yet had time to carefully examine his surroundings when Liu Yan's voice suddenly sounded in his ear: "Master!"

Hearing the call, he moved his awareness and immediately released Liu Yan.

Liu Yan did not take human form, but remained in the shape of a Fire Bird, hovering silently before Yang Kai, her eyes fixed on the magma pool; a trace of longing showed in her spirit.

"Is there something below that would be useful to you?" Yang Kai asked upon noticing this.

Liu Yan transmitted the thought: "It seems there is, and it is quite useful. I'll go take a look."

As she spoke, she spread her wings and flew to the magma pool, plunging straight into it.

"Be careful," Yang Kai hurriedly warned from behind, but Liu Yan had already vanished.

He involuntarily shook his head, then began to examine the area.

Although the cavern was not small, it was empty inside; after his gaze swept across it, the situation became clear at a glance.

Soon, Yang Kai's attention was drawn to a certain spot.

There, it seemed, a humanoid figure sat cross-legged; Yang Kai frowned and sent out his Divine Sense to probe, confirming that the figure was only a skeleton, without any life or aura—apparently dead for a very long time.

If his guess was correct, this should be the corpse of Gongsun Mu.

A generation's alchemy master and the Third Brother under Great Emperor Miaodan, he should have been an expert who called the shots in the Star Realm, yet to end up dying in a small place like Primordial Cauldron Mountain was a pitiful fate; Yang Kai could not help but sigh, wondering what Gongsun Mu had done to offend Great Emperor Miaodan, that he had been cast out and left so desolate, with no one to collect his body.

Steeling his heart, Yang Kai walked over to the skeleton; when he stood before it, he clasped his fist and bowed slightly.

After all, Gongsun Mu was a Senior and a Master Alchemist; even dead here, he deserved Yang Kai's salute.

When he straightened, Yang Kai's gaze was immediately drawn to the object in front of Gongsun Mu's skeleton.

Gongsun Mu had apparently kept watch here until his death, and not far before him lay something like a small pot. The little pot looked much like a cooking wok used by ordinary people, only far smaller, and beneath it, earth-fire drawn by a formation burned at the bottom.

What concerned Yang Kai was not the little pot itself, but what lay within it.

Inside the little pot simmered a thick medicinal soup, not much—about a bowl's worth—spread across the bottom.

From time to time a bubble rose in the soup and burst, emitting a five-colored glow; at the same time a strange, intoxicating fragrance wafted forth, filling the entire cavern.

At the scent, Yang Kai's expression shifted.

The fragrance was familiar; it was the same aroma he had smelled outside Primordial Cauldron Mountain.

Back then, so many martial artists had been drawn because of the anomaly at Primordial Cauldron Mountain—the erupting five-colored glow and the world-filling strange scent—everything was extremely similar to what lay before him now.

A pensive look immediately appeared on Yang Kai's face.

It seemed, then, that the anomaly at Primordial Cauldron Mountain was not the maturation of a heaven-and-earth treasure but was caused by this pot of medicinal soup.

Yang Kai's interest in the pot of medicinal soup rose at once; although he was eighty percent certain that this thick broth was not poison and would greatly benefit a martial artist, he would not rashly consume it without first understanding more.

Shifting his gaze, Yang Kai soon found a jade slip before Gongsun Mu's skeleton.

The jade slip appeared to have been placed there by Gongsun Mu before his death—neat and upright, clearly intended for any later reader.

Yang Kai first used his Divine Sense to check for danger, and upon confirming there was none, reached out to grasp the jade slip.

The instant he gripped the jade slip, an anomaly occurred.

The skeleton of Gongsun Mu, which should have been dead for who knew how long, suddenly twitched; then two greenish lights appeared in the eye sockets, flashing and condensing into a ball of light that shot toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was startled, stepped back and simultaneously mobilized his internal power to protect himself.

To his astonishment, the light ignored his protective power and struck straight into his chest, disappearing instantly.

For a moment Yang Kai was terrified, breaking out in a cold sweat; his Divine Sense swept through his body but, strangely, found no wounds and no sign of discomfort within.

After completing its action, Gongsun Mu's skeleton crumbled into a heap as if it had exhausted its last strength; the countless bones became as fragile as flour, many shattering to pieces.

After a short while everything returned to calm; Yang Kai stood where he was, clutching the jade slip, his face grim.

That strike had undoubtedly been some sort of interdiction cast by Gongsun Mu, yet even his Divine Sense could not probe it—clearly the restriction was supremely concealed and beyond his current ability to resolve.

After long thought, Yang Kai gritted his teeth and sat down, immersing his Divine Sense within the jade slip to examine it carefully.

He felt that since the jade slip had been intentionally left by Gongsun Mu, it must contain clues—perhaps revealing what had just occurred.

As his Divine Sense swept the script, the jade slip's contents became clear at a glance.

"I, Gongsun Mu, the Third Disciple beneath Great Emperor Miaodan—alone and helpless in my youth, reduced to begging for my daily bread—was fortunate enough to be noticed by the Emperor, who did not cast me aside but took me in as a disciple and taught me the Dao of Alchemy…"

The jade slip indeed belonged to Gongsun Mu, and the cave was likewise his; the jade slip's information was extensive. At first it was only Gongsun Mu's recollection: an unfortunate man who had tasted the chill and hardship of the world in his youth, nearly starving, and yet also a fortunate one who had been noticed by Great Emperor Miaodan and taken as a personal disciple, training at the Emperor's side while learning the alchemical arts.

"My talent exceeded that of my two Senior Brothers; the Emperor cherished me and taught me without reserve. My alchemy soon surpassed my two Senior Brothers; I rose to fame while young and became arrogant and unrestrained, mocking my brothers when they tried to admonish me, and thus a rift formed among us..."

"At three hundred years old I ascended to the Emperor Realm and was elevated to an Imperial‑Grade alchemist, my name spreading across the Star Realm. Still I was not content. Hoping to surpass my master on the Pill Dao, I began researching the Human Pill Dao — a method that maimed lives and affronted Heaven's balance. Senior Brother exposed me to our master; the master flew into a rage and ordered me to cease. I would not accept it. Outwardly I feigned compliance, but in secret I carried on, and before long things spun utterly out of my control…"

"At three hundred and fifty years old my secret was once again exposed by my Senior Brother; in a rage I struck and grievously wounded him. The Emperor could no longer tolerate me and expelled me from the sect. Then I sought out this Primordial Cauldron Mountain and hid here in seclusion..."

The jade slip recorded almost the whole of Gongsun Mu's life. By his own account his aptitude in alchemy nearly rivaled Great Emperor Miaodan's, but he had been impatient and sought results too quickly, studying the Human Pill Dao in hopes of overtaking his master.

Gongsun Mu did not explain exactly what the Human Pill Dao entailed, but the words between the lines made Yang Kai feel it must be an extremely cruel alchemical method.

His expulsion from the sect was clearly tied to the Human Pill Dao, and also stemmed from his having struck his Senior Brother, even injuring him gravely.

After being cast out, Gongsun Mu settled on Primordial Cauldron Mountain; after undergoing great changes, his temperament seemed to shift and he realized his errors.

He tried many times to return to Great Emperor Miaodan's side but could never see the Emperor's face again. In the end, he languished in gloom and died alone within his own grotto.

The jade slip not only contained these particulars but also Gongsun Mu's own understandings of the alchemical way; in effect the jade slip itself was Gongsun Mu's alchemical handbook, of enormous value to any alchemist.

Various pill formulas, spirit formations used during refinement, techniques, methods of extracting the pill—countless entries—any alchemist who saw them would be ecstatic.

Only Gongsun Mu also stated in the jade slip that all of this was the product of his life's wisdom and had nothing to do with what Great Emperor Miaodan had taught.

Without the Emperor's permission, he would never have dared or chosen to leave such knowledge on the jade slip.

"I do not know who you are, but since you have passed the many trials I set and obtained this jade slip, it proves you are also an alchemist—my craft will have a successor. Now that the jade slip is in your hands, you must have been struck by my Withered Soul Seal. Within a hundred years it does no harm, but after a century it will devour your soul. There are only two ways to lift the seal: either your cultivation surpasses mine, or you seek out my master and ask him to act. I hope you can meet my master within a hundred years and hand this jade slip to him, pleading that he take me back into the sect!"

"As compensation, you may take and consume the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup that I painstakingly brewed in the latter half of my life; its many benefits you will experience in time!"

The jade slip's content ended there.

After reading, Yang Kai exhaled heavily and felt his earlier worry ease.

At least now he knew what had happened to him a moment ago.

The Withered Soul Seal, it seemed, was a kind of restriction Gongsun Mu had activated before death—once someone took the jade slip, the Withered Soul Seal immediately activated and entered their body.

The seal posed no danger within one hundred years, but after one hundred years it would devour one's soul.

One hundred years was not short, so Yang Kai had no need to worry for the moment.

Simply surpassing Gongsun Mu's cultivation within one hundred years would break the Withered Soul Seal. Although Yang Kai did not know exactly what cultivation Gongsun Mu had at death, it must have been within the Emperor Realm.

If Gongsun Mu had reached the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, Yang Kai would have to ascend to the rank of Great Emperor to rely on his own strength to remove the seal.
