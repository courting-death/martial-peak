## Chapter 511 — The Ruler

The moment this mirror-shaped Mystery-Grade treasure was unveiled, Su Yan’s entire aura transformed dramatically. Although she was clearly standing beside Yang Kai, to the four Kang Family and Qiu Family experts, she appeared to flicker in and out of visibility, as if omnipresent. In other words, this woman at this moment had already fused inseparably with the Mystery-Grade treasure.

The four men’s faces turned grave, utterly baffled by this phenomenon.

This Mystery-Grade treasure was obviously taken out by Yang Kai, so how could this woman possibly resonate with the treasure in such a way?

Yang Kai and Su Yan also noticed this anomaly, exchanging a glance that spoke volumes of their excitement.

Before activating the mirror treasure, Yang Kai had not anticipated such an effect.

Now, he understood.

The two of them cultivated the Dual Cultivation Technique together, forging a First Stage bond of body and soul. The treasures each refined could be partially utilized by the other. Specifically, the treasure refined by Yang Kai could be used by Su Yan, and vice versa.

It meant they shared each other’s treasures.

Especially this armor treasure fixed with ice-cold attributes perfectly matched Su Yan’s True Yuan element—practically tailored for her. She could unleash its full power in a way even Yang Kai could not, since his True Yuan was completely opposite in nature to the treasure’s attribute.

When Yang Kai seized this treasure at Po Jing Lake, he had done so on a whim, believing its grade might be high. That inadvertent move now led to this extraordinary situation.

“It’s a barrier and suppression type treasure!” one Kang Family expert observed the surroundings solemnly, and the others nodded. They were all discerning and immediately recognized the treasure’s formidable nature.

The outer layer was wrapped in a layer of barrier and suppression seals, creating a combat zone within. Without breaking through this barrier and suppression, it was impossible to escape the treasure’s lockdown. But breaking such a barrier was no easy feat, especially under the vigilant eyes of Yang Kai and Su Yan. None of the four dared to act rashly.

A biting cold wind howled, a thick layer of snow covered the ground, and large snowflakes like goose feathers fell ceaselessly from the sky.

Even their True Yuan seemed frozen! The four furiously circulated their martial arts but still could not resist the cold’s invasion. In no time, frost covered their hair, beards, and clothes.

“How do you feel?” Yang Kai ignored the four experts and instead asked Su Yan.

“My strength has increased greatly. I feel...invincible!” Su Yan inhaled lightly, the cold air refreshing her senses.

Su Yan was not one to boast, so when she said this, it meant within this barrier and suppression, she truly was capable of anything!

Yang Kai laughed heartily: “Good, then from now on, this treasure belongs to you!”

“Mm.” Su Yan nodded slightly, accepting the gift from her man as was natural and proper.

Their conversation reached the ears of the four Divine Roaming Realm experts. Immediately, displeasure flickered in their eyes. Although this Mystery-Grade treasure was astonishing, they were no fools; how could they tolerate two juniors treating it so lightly?

“I’ll try it!” Su Yan said softly, raising her hand casually, as if waving at the four.

The already frigid wind suddenly intensified, howling with ice-cold ferocity. The four’s expressions changed. Though they still stood firmly, icicle-like thin shards quickly formed on their hair and beards, visible to the naked eye.

Their frantically circulated True Yuan was powerless to resist this biting cold; their bodies trembled slightly.

Su Yan moved gracefully, dark brows furrowed as if familiarizing herself with the treasure’s power. Her cold True Yuan gradually synchronized with the frozen surroundings.

Crackling noises echoed from the ground. From the snow several feet deep suddenly erupted countless dense ice spikes, the gusts they stirred whipped up thousands of waves of snow, like a collapsing mountain avalanche, engulfing the four men.

No escape—blocked from the sky and earth—these four top-tier martial artists from powerful sects were truly hard-pressed. Their True Yuan was restricted by the cold, slowing their movements and dulling their reflexes. Hastily, they combined their martial skills and treasures to block the attack, but before they could catch a breath, Su Yan struck again.

From the surrounding snow-covered mountains, brilliant, daylight-bright beams flared, as if distant forces were lobbing sharp attacks toward the four.

Yang Kai stood beside Su Yan, motionless but inwardly stirred.

He had never imagined this Mystery-Grade treasure would allow Su Yan to unleash her strength to such a degree. Single-handedly, she forced the four Divine Roaming Fifth Stage experts from the Zhongdu Eight Great Families onto the defensive with no chance of counterattack.

This treasure created the perfect battlefield environment for Su Yan; in this realm, she was the ruler!

As the treasure’s owner, Yang Kai had ironically become a bystander.

The treasure’s power was indeed terrifying, but Su Yan’s own strength was indisputable. The combination of their might forged the current scene.

Defeating the four was merely a matter of time. Watching her performance, Yang Kai felt his heart settle.

Outside the barrier and suppression, Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru had led reinforcements nearby. No one dared approach within thirty zhang of the position.

The overwhelming cold emitted was unbearable; even thirty zhang away, they had to circulate their cultivation techniques to resist.

“Break it!” Kang Zhan shouted fiercely, taking the lead. He produced a Mystery-Grade treasure he rarely used, pouring in True Yuan and attacking the semicircular barrier.

Ripples soon spread on the barrier’s surface, and the raging blizzard inside abruptly stopped—just for an instant.

After this strike, Kang Zhan was slightly breathless; his strength was modest and operating a Mystery-Grade treasure was a heavy burden. Fortunately, Qiu Ziru also possessed a treasure of the same level, and the other warriors were desperately releasing their attacks.

After a round, the barrier and suppression showed weakening signs. Kang Zhan’s expression brightened, and he called out excitedly: “Don’t stop, open it quickly!”

The longer this dragged on, the worse it was for their side. Most experts had already been drawn out to subdue Ying Jiu. If those four Divine Roaming experts from the Zhongdu Eight Great Families were lost inside the barrier, Kang Zhan could not imagine how he would capture Yang Kai.

His urgency surpassed all others.

Everyone was unreservedly pouring in True Yuan, desperately trying to break the semicircular barrier as swiftly as possible.

Suddenly, shouted voices came from nearby. Kang Zhan blinked, glancing in that direction. His face immediately darkened, and he angrily shouted: “Xiang Chu, Nan Sheng, what are you doing?”

There, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng had furtively led their forces from the Xiang and Nan families to the location where the Lingxiao Pavilion group stood.

Since the battle began, these people had remained there, observing quietly, agreeing with Yang Kai and Kang Zhan not to interfere.

Yet now, as everyone bombarded the suppression barrier, Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu suddenly turned their gaze toward them.

Their sudden move was spotted by Kang Zhan.

Nan Sheng, confronting the Lingxiao Pavilion, showed impatience, ignoring Kang Zhan’s question. With a grim expression, he shouted at the Lingxiao Pavilion members: “Surrender obediently! Otherwise, I’ll show you a world of pain! I have all the time to play with you!”

Several senior uncles inside the Lingxiao Pavilion frowned, stepping protectively before their younger disciples. Although anger surged, they did not lash out. Sternly, one said, “Gentlemen, my young master Yang Kai has already reached an agreement with your leader. Why do you turn renegade?”

Nan Sheng sneered coldly, “What agreement? I don’t know it. Whoever made it with Yang Kai, ask them. Do you really think Lingxiao Pavilion is untouchable? I’ll try and see if Yang Kai can do anything to me today!”

“Sir, do not be so unreasonable.”

“Unreasonable?” Nan Sheng laughed loudly, “Tell Yang Kai that phrase and see if he even knows what it means!”

Then he barked coldly: “Surround them! Anyone who resists is to be killed without mercy! Isn’t Yang Kai cared for by you? I want to see just how much!”

The soldiers of the Nan and Xiang families stepped forward aggressively, encircling the Lingxiao Pavilion with hostile expressions.

Lingxiao Pavilion’s fighters roared in anger, and the younger disciples were furious. The situation was on the brink of erupting into all-out battle.

Kang Zhan hurriedly charged over, grabbing Nan Sheng’s collar, teeth clenched as he shouted, “What are you doing?”

Nan Sheng regarded it casually, smiling faintly as he freed his hand from Kang Zhan’s grip. Calmly, he said: “Young Master Kang, do you think the four masters from the Kang and Qiu families inside can catch Yang Kai?”

Kang Zhan frowned deeply, clearly displeased. He scoffed coldly: “Whether they catch him or not has nothing to do with what you’re doing now.”

“Of course it does,” Nan Sheng replied composedly, showing no trace of nervousness. “If those four fail to catch Yang Kai, this whole operation is essentially a failure! We’ve mobilized so many troops but can’t defeat three of them. If that spreads... Heh heh. Young Master Kang, you don’t need me to explain the consequences, right?”

“What do you mean?” Kang Zhan’s anger began to subside. Earlier, upon seeing Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu attempt something against Lingxiao Pavilion’s members, he thought they wanted to vent their grudges with a massacre.

Naturally, he was furious—firstly because Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu ignored his commands, and secondly because he did not wish to offend Yang Kai too severely.

But now, seeing no one was hurt, he was willing to hear their explanation.

Moreover, the current situation was indeed grim. If Yang Kai escaped, Kang Zhan could not explain it to Yang Zhao, and his standing, already inferior to Ye Xinrou, would only deteriorate further by this fiasco.
