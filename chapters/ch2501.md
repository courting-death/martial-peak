## Chapter 2501 — You Want to Seize My Body?

Boom…

A terrifying explosion resounded, and the world was filled with a blinding white light, making it impossible to see anything.

“Hm?” Duan Hongchen, who was charging toward Wu Kuang, ready to drag him down with a self-destruction, suddenly frowned as an intense sense of unease surged from deep within his heart.

Because Wu Kuang detonated the Primordial Gale before he could.

What was he doing?

Before he could figure it out, the aftermath of the world-shattering explosion spread in all directions.

This was the shockwave from the Primordial Gale’s self-destruction. Wherever the violent gale swept, everything was reduced to nothingness, ceasing to exist.

Even this bizarre world instantly collapsed, with cracking sounds echoing from every corner, as if it could not hold together much longer.

“Not good!” Duan Hongchen suddenly realized something was wrong. He quickly jabbed several major acupoints on his body in rapid succession, forcefully suppressing the self-destruction.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

The gale struck, tossing him about like a lone boat on a stormy sea, in danger of capsizing at any moment. Fortunately, the Origin Power of the Divine Tree Baiyi continued to protect him, offering some defense. Even so, his clothes were torn and his flesh was mangled.

He struggled to release his Divine Sense and clearly sensed Wu Kuang’s skeleton disintegrating into dust after the Primordial Gale’s self-destruction.

This skeleton, which had slumbered for tens of thousands of years and belonged to the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, was finally destroyed today. In other words, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor Wu Kuang could never rebuild his physical body again.

Yet Duan Hongchen felt no joy; only that the situation had grown more dire.

Rumble…

The sound of heaven and earth collapsing rang out as this strange world finally gave way and was utterly destroyed.

A massive black hole formed, and in less than ten breaths, it devoured everything there. Then, with a slight tremor, it vanished without a trace.

In the Void Passage connected to the black hole, Yang Kai felt dizzy and adrift, his face full of lingering fear.

He had just advanced to the Emperor Realm, delighting in his newfound strength and the transformation of his Emperor Yuan. He hadn’t expected the aftermath of the two Great Emperors’ battle to destroy that strange world.

He had no time to escape before being swallowed by the black hole into this Void Passage.

Even though he was far from the battlefield of the two Great Emperors, he was still seriously injured. After being swallowed, it took him a long time to recover, his face still showing lingering fear.

He had no idea what had happened between the two Great Emperors. All his attention had been on his breakthrough and advancement, and by the time he realized something was wrong, it was already too late.

What about the Mortal Great Emperor? Was he alive or dead?

Duan Hongchen had deep ties with the Qingyang Shrine. After all, Hall Master Wen Zishan was raised by Duan Hongchen himself, and Yang Kai was also a registered disciple of the Qingyang Shrine, so he naturally cared about his situation.

Even without this connection, the Mortal Great Emperor’s disregard for life and death, his repeated self-severing of cultivation over tens of thousands of years, and his search for Wu Kuang in the Shattered Star Sea for the sake of all living beings, was enough to command respect.

That terrifying power just now was most likely the result of something self-destructing. The only thing Yang Kai could think of was that the Mortal Great Emperor had chosen to self-destruct, seeking to perish together with Wu Kuang.

At this thought, Yang Kai’s expression dimmed, feeling that the Mortal Great Emperor’s Divine Soul was likely completely annihilated.

He coughed up several mouthfuls of clotted blood, took out some healing pills from his Spatial Ring, and swallowed them like beans before sitting cross-legged. He released his Divine Sense to examine his condition.

What he saw shocked him.

Because as soon as he used his Divine Sense, he sensed a pair of sinister eyes staring at him—not from outside, but from within his own body.

His expression changed drastically. Forming a hand seal, he shouted in a low voice, “Condense!”

In the next instant, his Spirit Body appeared in his Sea of Consciousness.

In the Sea of Consciousness, a figure had appeared out of nowhere, standing quietly above the surging waters, looking around with great interest, clicking his tongue in wonder.

Staring at the figure, Yang Kai gritted his teeth and shouted, “Wu Kuang!”

At the sound, the figure slowly turned, revealing the face of a middle-aged man. His features were naturally imposing, exuding an innate nobility, and his eyes shone brightly.

Although Yang Kai had never seen this man’s face before, he instantly recognized his identity.

Heaven Devouring Great Emperor Wu Kuang!

Yang Kai’s heart sank to the bottom. He hadn’t even noticed how the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had broken through his Sea of Consciousness’s defenses and entered this place. If the other party hadn’t made no effort to hide, he would have remained completely unaware.

Yang Kai felt a chill all over, his soul trembling.

Wu Kuang now also appeared as a Spirit Body, but his soul was far more solid than Yang Kai’s—almost as if it had taken on physical form.

“Boy, how dare you shout my name!” Wu Kuang snorted coldly, and an invisible shockwave suddenly blasted toward Yang Kai.

This shockwave was clearly a force of a Divine Soul, its power terrifying. Yang Kai’s expression changed, and with a wave of his hand, he raised the seawater below to form a barrier in front of himself.

With a boom, the shockwave struck the water, stirring up towering waves throughout the Sea of Consciousness that took a long time to subside.

Yang Kai retreated several steps, his face ashen, staring warily at Wu Kuang. He said in a deep voice, “Wu Kuang, get out of here, or don’t blame me for being rude!”

Wu Kuang’s Spirit Body had suddenly appeared in his Sea of Consciousness, giving Yang Kai a terrible feeling. He dared not let him linger here. Letting him glimpse some secrets was a small matter, but he feared this man had some unspeakable purpose.

“Rude to me?” Wu Kuang glanced at Yang Kai and sneered, “That’s a new one. I haven’t heard that in a long time. But since I’m here, I won’t leave so easily.”

“What do you want?” Yang Kai stared at him coldly.

Wu Kuang chuckled and said, “Why ask when you already know? You’re a clever boy. Don’t you know why I’m here?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s face turned extremely ugly. Of all things to fear, this was it.

Wu Kuang said, “That old bastard Duan Hongchen destroyed my body. Without a body, no matter how strong I am, I’m just a wandering soul. Boy, your body isn’t bad. I like it. Hand it over obediently, and I’ll let you witness the pinnacle of the Martial Dao with me!”

Yang Kai gritted his teeth. “You want to seize my body?”

Wu Kuang snorted, “No need to put it so harshly. I just need a body. If you cooperate, I won’t devour your Divine Soul, and you can stay here. But if you don’t… I don’t mind showing you the true gap in strength.”

Yang Kai sneered, “This is my Sea of Consciousness. Aren’t you being a bit too arrogant?”

Wu Kuang looked at him in surprise, then slowly shook his head. “Stubborn fool!”

After speaking, he ignored Yang Kai and began surveying the surroundings again. After a moment, he nodded. “Your Divine Soul is indeed extraordinary, far beyond any ordinary Emperor. And it’s even a mutated Divine Soul flame. You really do meet my requirements. It’s surprising you’ve cultivated to this level…”

He acted like he owned the place, commenting loudly without caring how Yang Kai felt. Yang Kai wanted to attack him but dared not act rashly.

An old monster who had lived for who knows how many years—his strength and methods couldn’t be judged by common sense. If a sneak attack failed, the situation would only get worse.

As he watched, Wu Kuang’s gaze suddenly sharpened, fixing on a certain direction. He exclaimed, “That island…”

He stared blankly at the seven-colored island floating in the Sea of Consciousness, his face showing suspicion and surprise. After a long look, his body suddenly trembled and he cried out, “Warm Spirit Lotus! It’s the Warm Spirit Lotus!”

Even someone as knowledgeable as Wu Kuang, once hailed as the number one in the Star Realm, couldn’t help but feel a surge of emotion. His eyes burned as he stared at the seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus, his expression strained. “Boy, you actually have the Warm Spirit Lotus!”

Yang Kai said coldly, “Making a fuss over nothing!”

Wu Kuang laughed heartily. “I never thought I’d see the Warm Spirit Lotus here. Back then, I searched countless Star Domains for it and found nothing. Who would have thought I’d see it today? Truly, you search high and low only to find it by chance.”

“Hmph, what are you so happy about? It’s not yours!” Yang Kai looked at him with disdain.

“It will be mine soon!” Wu Kuang seemed in a great mood, ignoring Yang Kai’s mockery. He stared greedily at the Warm Spirit Lotus for a while, then nodded. “Very good, very good. With this Warm Spirit Lotus, I can fuse with your body perfectly, with no fear of backlash. In time, regaining my peak will be no problem.” He seemed to see a bright future ahead, his mood soaring. As he looked around again, his eyes landed on the starry sky above, and he raised his brows in surprise. “Boy, you really do have a lot of good things.”

Yang Kai’s heart stirred, and he asked, “You recognize that?”

He was referring, of course, to the Star Chart in the sky. Yang Kai had obtained this Star Chart long ago; every star here corresponded to a star in the Hengluo Star Domain.

When Yang Kai roamed the Hengluo Star Domain, he used the Star Chart in his Sea of Consciousness to navigate. Without it, he would have been lost in the vast Star Domain.

Yet he had never truly understood what that Star Chart actually was, nor why it could correspond so perfectly with the entire Star Domain.

Hearing Wu Kuang’s words, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel curious.

Wu Kuang smiled meaningfully at him. “You must have come to the Star Realm from a lower Star Domain, right?”

Yang Kai frowned. “That’s right.”

There was nothing to hide about this, so he admitted it readily.
