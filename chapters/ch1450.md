## Chapter 1450 — Valley Herb Garden

Kong Wendong's fall held little suspense; although his cultivation was not inferior to that of the young woman from Ice Heart Valley, facing four opponents at once, with the woman calmly unleashing the might of the Profound Yin Heart-Crushing Drum and Yang Kai striking from the side, even the greatest talents could not escape such a fate.

He barely clung on for the length of an incense stick, then was struck down by the four in concert until his soul and spirit were utterly annihilated.

The Ice Heart Valley young woman's remark was not wrong — within Kong Wendong's body there was the Qiantian Thunderfire, identical to that possessed by the black-robed elder: a pitch-black flame in which arcs of lightning leaped about, exceedingly strange.

After Kong Wendong's death, that Qiantian Thunderfire was naturally swallowed into the belly of the Artifact Spirit fire bird.

When the battle ended, the spoils were of course divided; the Spatial Rings on the enemies' hands could not be left behind. Yang Kai unceremoniously claimed Kong Wendong's Spatial Ring for himself, while the remaining three were left to be handled as Ice Heart Valley's three women wished.

Though the beautiful matron seemed somewhat displeased, she said nothing more. After all, if not for Yang Kai’s intervention this time, not only would they have gained nothing, but their very lives might have been at risk — at the very least, the weakest of the three women would have been in grave danger.

The Artifact Spirit fire bird circled above Yang Kai's head, chirping happily; after devouring the two Qiantian Thunderfires it seemed to be in high spirits.

The young woman's beautiful eyes revealed a hint of caution as she looked at the fire bird. She could not discern much of Yang Kai's true ability, but the powerful spiritual qi emanating from the Artifact Spirit within the fire bird was plainly evident.

This is an Artifact Spirit that can rival a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert! the young woman judged inwardly.

"Young brother, I thank you greatly. Were it not for your righteous intervention, my sisters and I likely could not have slain these thieves of the Fire Radiance Sect." The young woman's face brightened with a radiant smile as she offered thanks.

Yang Kai gave a casual smile and replied lightly, "You flatter me, madam; we merely took what we each needed. Besides, they struck at me first."

Although that young woman had enveloped him as well when she used the Profound Yin Heart-Crushing Drum earlier—whether intentionally or not—Yang Kai had no intention of falling out with them over it.

Still, some necessary deterrence and a reminder were required, lest they betray him after crossing the river. The Profound Yin Heart-Crushing Drum was no trifling technique and would be troublesome to deal with; if unnecessary, Yang Kai did not wish to provoke conflict with Ice Heart Valley's three women — he only wanted to get into the Imperial Garden quickly.

That was why he had not recalled the Artifact Spirit — he wanted it to apply pressure on them, to keep the young woman from reneging on her words.

"By the way, madam, you haven't explained why two members of the Fire Radiance Sect cultivate a secret art like Qiantian Thunderfire," Yang Kai asked in puzzlement.

"Heh heh, so Young Brother was wondering about this." The young woman smiled, not hiding anything, and explained in a measured tone: "In truth, many within the Fire Radiance Sect cultivate this secret art. It's not only those two — any warrior of somewhat greater strength within the sect can cultivate it. Its potency, however, varies."

"Oh? How do they manage it?" Yang Kai's interest was piqued. Qiantian Thunderfire would be of great benefit to the Artifact Spirit, and among the four Fire Radiance Sect members here only Kong Wendong and the black-robed elder possessed Qiantian Thunderfire. Hearing the young woman's words, he naturally took notice.

"It's simple. The Fire Radiance Sect possesses a Qiantian Thunderflame, the very foundation of their sect. By relying on this Qiantian Thunderflame and pairing it with a secret art, the sect's senior warriors can cultivate Qiantian Thunderfire, which has many uses in combat," the young woman explained softly, then idly asked, "You ask as if you are not from Chi Lan Star?"

"No, I'm not from Chi Lan Star," Yang Kai neither denied nor offered his background, merely nodding lightly. "I see, the Qiantian Thunderflame..."

Though Qiantian Thunderflame differed from Qiantian Thunderfire by only a single word in the name, it was the very foundation of the Fire Radiance Sect and the root from which Kong Wendong and the others cultivated their Qiantian Thunderfire. If the Artifact Spirit could swallow that Qiantian Thunderflame, what benefits would it reap?

Of course, such a thought flashed through Yang Kai's mind only briefly.

Setting aside where Chi Lan Star lay within the Star Domain, Yang Kai could not suddenly run there without cause; moreover, the Fire Radiance Sect was not something one could infiltrate alone — from Kong Wendong's cultivation it was likely the sect had Void King-Grade experts stationed to guard it!

"Forget it, let's not speak of that now," Yang Kai grinned, "Madam, should we go and look at that secret grotto? There may be many valuable things inside!"

"Heh heh, that should be so." The young woman's mouth twitched; though unwilling at heart, she could not renege on the agreement made with Yang Kai.

Previously she had not regarded Yang Kai's strength highly and assumed she could dictate the spoils, but after witnessing the battle she realized her notion was wishful thinking.

He was not someone she could crush at will, and he clearly bore some caution toward her; otherwise the fire bird would not have circled his head constantly.

With that thought, the young woman sighed softly, unwilling to stir further trouble, and led the way toward the valley's location.

The other two women quickly followed.

Before long the quartet returned to the barrier at the valley's entrance.

The barrier remained as before; the light screen flashed now and then — clearly the mark of previous attacks — but it had not yet been breached.

"Young brother, do you know arrays?" the Ice Heart Valley young woman asked as she turned to Yang Kai.

"No," Yang Kai shook his head decisively. If Yang Yan had been here, dismantling such a barrier might have taken no more than a dozen breaths, but he did not possess Yang Yan's skill.

The young woman smiled bitterly. "Then there's no way; my sisters and I haven't studied arrays either. If we want to break it, we'll have to do it by force."

Saying so, she first drew a longsword of crystal clarity, as if carved from ice jade, poured Saint Yuan into it, and formed a blade of radiance to strike the barrier. The other two Ice Heart Valley women followed suit.

Yang Kai, of course, did not idle. He did not use a secret treasure — not because he lacked the desire, but because his attacking secret treasure was the Dragon Bone Dripping Jade Sword; it was not to be shown lightly.

He could only employ his own Demonic Flame, condensing attacks that hammered at the barrier; the alternating hot and cold changes in the Demonic Flame wrought unexpected damage upon the screen.

Thus his force was by no means weaker than that of the other three women.

For a time the valley entrance resounded with the constant roar of the four striking the barrier.

No barrier, however strong, could withstand such relentless bombardment, and besides, these seals were likely left behind countless years ago; though once impregnable, their power had long since waned.

Nevertheless, the four still attacked fiercely for half a day before finally shattering the barrier that stood before them!

During the assault the three Ice Heart Valley women had been anxious, fearing a stronger foe might appear. When the barrier finally fell their faces grew joyful; after a glance between them the young woman led them swiftly inward.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to probe; after confirming the interior held no great danger, he followed.

The valley was gourd-shaped: narrow at the mouth but exceedingly spacious within.

Traversing the ten-li mountain path, the scene that greeted them stunned everyone into silence.

Ahead lay several patches of herb fields, planted with numerous exotic flowers and herbs; though untended for countless years, these spiritual herbs still thrived.

At a glance there were at least a thousand plants.

The entire valley was suffused with the fragrance of medicine.

This turned out to be a hidden herb garden!

Yang Kai couldn't help but show joy and excitement; the three Ice Heart Valley women shared similar reactions, each breathing rapidly as an unusual light shone in their eyes.

After all, this place had been untouched for at least tens of thousands of years; even the lowest-grade materials would possess centuries upon centuries of medicinal age!

With such long ages, even the most ordinary herbs were priceless — no wonder they were so excited.

Even this harvest alone made the trip worthwhile.

Yet the leading young woman did not let the temptation cloud her mind; she turned to Yang Kai and asked, "Young brother, what do you think..."

"Mm, gather first. Once we've finished collecting, we'll divide it up," Yang Kai grinned, unconcerned.

"Very well!" The young woman nodded slightly; after exchanging looks with the other two, they immediately dispersed to gather the herbs.

Though gathering herbs required care — a single slip when picking some precious plants could greatly reduce their medicinal properties — all present were Origin Returning Realm warriors experienced in such matters, so Yang Kai did not need to instruct them further.

As for pilfering into one's own pocket, that was unlikely; Yang Kai's Divine Sense was laid bare, and even if the three harbored the thought, they would scarcely dare.

While they gathered, Yang Kai did not idle. He moved through the fields, carefully harvesting herbs one by one; his technique and speed far outstripped the three women.

As a pill refiner, these actions were second nature to him.

The more he gathered the more excited Yang Kai became, for within this hidden garden he found many spiritual herbs long thought extinct, and numerous items even he could not identify.

These materials were undoubtedly of tremendous value.

The grades varied from Saint King-Grade up to Void King-Grade, but even the lowest grade, given their enormous medicinal ages, could still produce extraordinary pills.
