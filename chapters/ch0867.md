## Chapter 867 — Old Man?

The brilliant golden light that had just wounded Xueli and the imposing roar gave Zhang Ao and the others fresh hope; they silently thought that once that expert arrived they would be safe.

"Indeed!" Cao Guan agreed. "Brothers, we don't wish to be your enemies either — we were only tricked by that wretched maid Xueli and had no choice. Let us part ways now and never meet again; better to settle grudges than to make them…"

The Ancient Demon Clan remained silent, instead turning their inquiring gazes toward Yang Kai.

Zhang Ao and the others instantly realized he was the one who could decide their fates. Thinking back to the troubles with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land two or three years ago and how they had hunted Yang Kai for so long, their hearts grew anxious; they both quietly gathered power and watched Yang Kai warily.

They feared this brat might spit out a single word — "kill".

Fortunately, the human expert who had struck Xueli from tens of li away arrived quickly; when Zhang Ao and the others saw the number of arrivals, their faces brightened and their spirits rose — their previous worry abruptly disappeared.

They discovered there was not just one newcomer, but five!

One was at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm and four at the First Stage; in a flash they appeared not far from the crowd, frowning as they looked over.

The leader was white-haired and venerable, with an immortal air; though unnamed, he was obviously among the world's top experts. The four accompanying cultivators' auras were also strong — it seemed they had reached the Saint Realm some years ago.

The five Saint Realm experts who arrived — four men and one woman — simply glanced at the scene and then all fixed their gaze on Yang Kai, wearing expressions of puzzlement.

The woman even shot Yang Kai a quiet scolding, her pearly teeth briefly showing while her lips moved; no one could tell what she said.

Judging from her mouthshape, it seemed she was cursing him.

The arrival of the five increased Zhang Ao's confidence; he cupped his fist and called out loudly, "May I ask your names and which faction you belong to?"

The aged leader glanced at him, frowning. "Tianxiao Sect… Chu Lingxiao!"

"Chu Lingxiao?" Zhang Ao's face lit up. "Brother Chu! My apologies — I've long heard of your renown. Seeing you now, you live up to it; even that villainous Demon General Xueli fled at your approach. Truly admirable."

"Who are you?" Chu Lingxiao looked over at the Ancient Demon Clan and then at Zhang Ao's party, asking in a deep voice; he clearly wasn't impressed by their flattery.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan hurriedly gave their names.

"Poxuan Palace, War Soul Hall?" Chu Lingxiao pondered and then said with interest, "You two came from over a hundred thousand li away — what brings you here, and why such a large force?"

Hearing the slight rebuke in his tone, Zhang Ao felt a pang of unease.

Although this place wasn't close to Tianxiao Sect, it was still within its nearby territory. Outsiders passing through should notify the local masters. This time they had only paid heavily to invite Ancient Moon Sanctuary and Rashomon Gate to assist at the snowy mountain.

Since those two factions had no true experts present, Zhang Ao and Cao Guan weren't worried they'd cause trouble.

He explained, "We came following clues about the Coffin-Bearer, but unexpectedly many demons appeared here. It seems Demon General Xueli was up to some vile deeds. We accidentally disrupted her. If Brother Chu had not arrived in time, we might have paid with our lives!"

Zhang Ao spoke with genuine lingering fear, as if reliving the moment.

Cao Guan quickly chimed in to support the story.

Li Rong sneered coldly, her eyes full of malice. "Turning black into white — these people are skilled at it. Master, shall we silence them forever?"

Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Her words were not quiet; Zhang Ao's ears caught them and he flushed with rage, roaring, "Witch! In front of my people's top experts you still dare to be insolent? Surrender obediently and you'll be spared!"

At that moment Zhang Ao seemed like a different person.

Before Chu Lingxiao's arrival he and Cao Guan had been obsequious, preaching that enemies were better reconciled than made.

But once Chu Lingxiao arrived, they changed their tune in an instant.

Li Rong's gaze toward them turned scornful.

"Brother Chu!" Zhang Ao addressed Chu Lingxiao. "These demon scum must be Xueli's agents planted on human land. There's no need to argue — kill them all. And these two human traitors are in league with them!"

As he spoke, he pointed at Yang Kai and Wu Jie.

"Is that so?" Chu Lingxiao glanced coolly, then looked toward Yang Kai and sighed lightly.

He was puzzled why his disciple would be entangled with such a mess, and Yang Kai clearly seemed to have close ties with those demons.

That brat… Chu Lingxiao privately shook his head, his feelings complicated.

"Master, if that old man moves to strike, you should retreat with Han Fei; she'll keep you safe," Li Rong whispered into Yang Kai's ear, on guard.

Chu Lingxiao's presence put considerable pressure on them; as a Third Stage Saint Realm expert he truly was among the pinnacle of the world.

What Li Rong feared most was the chain-like secret treasure that had just wounded Xueli.

That pure Yang-attributed aura was particularly effective against the demon's internal Demon Yuan. When wielded by a master like him, its power was formidable.

After suffering that blow, Li Rong estimated Xueli would need a month or two to fully recover.

"Old man?" Yang Kai arched an eyebrow and let out a surprised, amused smile, not replying to Li Rong but instead cupping his fists toward Chu Lingxiao, "Disciple pays respects to the Patriarch!"

Li Rong covered her mouth, her eyes trembling slightly, hardly able to believe Yang Kai and this human expert were related.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan also showed stunned faces as they realized — they had heard such rumors before.

Yang Kai was indeed from Tianxiao Sect!

He had simply been too excited moments ago to remember.

"You brat, come over!" Fei Yu, who had been standing behind Chu Lingxiao, scolded in a coquettish voice.

"Coming…" Yang Kai looked helpless and hurried over.

When he reached them, Yang Kai gave an awkward, forced laugh, his expression embarrassed.

Around them, the Ancient Demon Clan and Zhang Ao, Cao Guan, and the others watched with strange looks, straining to hear what was said.

But Chu Lingxiao merely waved his hand and blocked everyone's probing; he turned that area into an impregnable restricted zone.

"How did the Patriarch and the four seniors come here?" Yang Kai's face twitched as he looked uneasily at the them.

Cang Yan said in a low voice, "When that witch arrived, the Patriarch sensed it. He didn't know why she came, so he watched in secret until today's battle erupted, then appeared and struck her as she fled. Unfortunately, she still managed to escape."

"So that's it!" Yang Kai suddenly understood.

Although Chu Lingxiao had long secluded himself in that secret chamber, the arrival of a powerhouse like Xueli within a thousand li could not escape his senses.

In an instant Yang Kai gained a clear, deep understanding of Chu Lingxiao's might.

He had long wondered what cultivation the Patriarch truly possessed.

Now it was obvious: he was unquestionably a Third Stage Saint Realm expert.

After all, back then he had slain a Demon General!

"You brat, weren't you in Giant Stone City with Elder Du discussing alchemy? How did you end up here?" Fei Yu scolded, half angry and half amused. Last time Mi Na had gone to Tianxiao Sect to send a message from Yang Kai, saying he'd stay in Giant Stone City a while, so Fei Yu hadn't bothered to look him up — she never expected to meet him here.

"It's a long story… where should the junior begin?" Yang Kai massaged his temples.

"Tell us whatever you can. Don't force yourself about what you can't say; I'm curious too," Chu Lingxiao said with a gentle smile, amiable. He showed no blame at Yang Kai's closeness to the Ancient Demon Clan.

Yang Kai looked at him and then at the four seniors — he found them all watching him with probing eyes.

He inclined his head slightly. "Then I will speak — Patriarch, senior aunt and uncles, try not to be too surprised."

"Hmph, what could you possibly have to surprise us?" Fei Yu sneered.

"It begins shortly after I first arrived on the Tongxuan Continent…" Yang Kai thought back and recounted how he had met the Coffin-Bearer in Blazing Fire City and been captured and taken into a Small Xuan Realm. Chu Lingxiao and the senior uncles wore expressions of astonishment.

He didn't dare mention his Indomitable Golden Body of the Demon God, only saying that he had used the condition of rescuing the Ancient Demon Clan to persuade them to submit.

Although that story had gaps and many unclear parts, Chu Lingxiao and the seniors did not press further and listened quietly.

Once they understood why the demon clan was close to Yang Kai, Chu Lingxiao pondered, "So they obey you completely?"

"Yes."

"Will they resist in any way?"

"No!" Yang Kai replied firmly.

Chu Lingxiao studied him deeply, as if trying to peer into his soul. After a long moment he retracted his gaze and nodded lightly. "That's good. You're young but steady; you shouldn't harm humanity. If they obey you, they can be a force at your disposal… but remember, power is a double-edged sword — misuse it and it may wound you."

Yang Kai considered this and nodded seriously. "Disciple remembers."

"And be prepared to be hated and targeted by countless people. If you lack that resolve, I advise you to abandon them; once you accept them, your path will likely be strewn with thorns, and many — known and unknown — will see you as a life-and-death enemy!" Chu Lingxiao warned solemnly.

"Disciple has that resolve!"

"Then I have little more to say." Chu Lingxiao smiled faintly. "But Tianxiao Sect cannot accommodate them. Where do you plan to place them? You can't take them to the Demon Domain, can you?"
