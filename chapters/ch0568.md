## Chapter 568 — The Greatest Person Under Heaven

The five Evil Kings spoke with great confidence in Yang Bai.

Yang Bai’s expression was indifferent as he casually said, “Let’s go take a look.”

He himself had become interested in the mysterious barrier treasure that could stop these five Evil Kings.

Arriving outside Yang Kai’s residence, Yang Bai looked solemnly at the transparent Heavenly Journey Palace barrier. His powerful Divine Sense probed again and again, yet he never showed any intention to attack.

The Evil Kings waited quietly, showing no impatience.

After a long while, Yang Bai finally shook his head. “There’s nothing I can do about this.”

“What?” The crowd gasped, their faces filled with disbelief.

They had personally experienced Yang Bai’s overwhelming strength and had always considered him the strongest expert under heaven. Yet now, hearing such words from him, they could hardly believe it.

Even their lord couldn’t break through this barrier?

“Interesting. This treasure has already surpassed the boundaries of this world. It is not something one of our cultivation realms can possess. Who released it?” Yang Bai asked with a faint smile.

“That person,” Poison King signaled Meng Wuya.

Yang Bai immediately fixed his gaze on Meng Wuya. The two regarded each other from tens of zhang away. The Evil Lord’s gaze subtly revealed respect and longing. Meanwhile, Meng Wuya, even as he looked at the Evil Lord, remained calm and serene, as if standing atop the clouds, looking down on him.

Yang Bai then turned to look at Earth Demon in the crowd, smiling warmly with a touch of kindness on his face as he lightly nodded: “Greetings!”

Earth Demon laughed weirdly, “Jie jie jie jie...”

No one understood why the two exchanged such greetings as if they were old acquaintances, except Yang Kai, who pondered this silently.

If his speculation was correct, Evil Lord Yang Bai’s remarkable cultivation achievements and current power stemmed from the demonic master’s corpse trapped in Dragon Confinement Ravine.

During those years trapped in Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Bai must have gleaned some cultivation methods from that corpse, inheriting the demonic master’s legacy, which explained his rapid progress and powerful divine abilities.

That corpse now belonged to Earth Demon, whose soul had possessed it, absorbing the evil qi under Dragon Confinement Ravine and successfully usurping the body.

One had inherited the demonic master’s legacy; the other had occupied his corpse. Sharing the same origin, a subtle resonance naturally existed between them.

Yang Bai’s expression suddenly turned serious as he bowed slightly and said in a low voice, “Master!”

Ling Taixu snorted coldly, his face ashen. “I am not your master.”

Yang Bai rose and replied lightly, “Once a master, a master for life. Whether you acknowledge it or not, I, Yang Bai, have only one master in this lifetime—yourself.”

Only then did those at Yang Kai’s residence recall that Ling Taixu and the Evil Lord were master and disciple.

Though having groomed such a disciple was pride-worthy, anyone could hear the disappointment and regret in Ling Taixu’s tone.

Had he slain this rebellious disciple back then, rather than strip him of cultivation and abandon him to Dragon Confinement Ravine to perish, countless innocent lives and bloodshed would not have flooded the land.

“I heard that Master has broken through his mental block. I am pleased,” Evil Lord gazed calmly at Ling Taixu.

“Thanks to you, I have turned misfortune into blessing,” Ling Taixu’s face was cold and impassive.

“You have taught your disciple for many years. I should've contributed something back.” Yang Bai spoke without any guilt, angering the Lingxiao Pavilion crowd instantly.

Ling Taixu sneered, his gaze icy.

In the past, he had held high hopes for his second disciple, quietly believing he could reach great heights alongside his eldest brother. He had nurtured him carefully. Now, he felt utterly disappointed.

“Are you the junior nephew then?” Yang Bai suddenly looked toward Yang Kai in the crowd, his gaze sharp. “By the way, this should be our first meeting.”

“Senior Uncle, I’ve long heard of you,” Yang Kai smiled broadly.

Yang Bai nodded lightly. “How is your father?”

Yang Kai sneered coldly, his gaze as sharp as a blade. “Thanks to Senior Uncle, my father is well.”

“That’s good.” Yang Bai took a breath and said no more.

Everything that needed to be said had been said, greetings exchanged, but with the other side sealed behind the barrier, there was nothing more he could do. Lingering here would only waste time.

“Qingluo, you stay here and watch them. The rest follow me,” Yang Bai instructed coldly. He then bowed to Ling Taixu and led five of the Evil Kings away with grace.

Only Shan Qingluo remained, standing in place with a strange expression.

She did not know if Yang Bai had a deeper meaning in arranging for her to stay and watch over this place.

---

Soon, warriors and demonic beasts from Cangyun Evil Land gathered in War City. Under Yang Bai and the five Evil Kings’ leadership, they charged with overwhelming momentum toward Zhongdu, clearly aiming to launch a fierce surprise attack while Zhongdu’s defenses were weak.

After they left, Shan Qingluo glanced distantly at Yang Kai, then stepped toward Yang Kai’s residence.

Bilo suddenly appeared from somewhere and followed closely behind her.

Everyone at Yang Kai’s residence, regardless of age or gender, stared blankly at this worldly-famous Enchantress Queen. Even without using her charms, her unparalleled allure was something ordinary people could not bear.

Many young men looked dazed as if their souls had been drained. The women compared themselves silently and each felt a subtle sense of inferiority.

Within the residence, only Su Yan’s peerless beauty could compete with Shan Qingluo.

Perhaps Xia Ningshang could as well, but no one had seen her true face, not even Yang Kai, so no comparison could be made. Still, in exquisite charm and seduction, no woman could rival Shan Qingluo.

“Such a temptress!” The Hu sisters sneered in hate, wondering how this woman could be so ruinous.

Her waist swayed sinuously like a boneless water snake, creating waves of captivating ripples. Her plump hips stood high, her fiery red clothing exuding a fanatical passion.

Shan Qingluo smiled lightly as she halted outside the barrier, gracefully gazing at Yang Kai.

“Shopkeeper Meng, let her in,” Yang Kai said.

Meng Wuya was taken aback, looking at Yang Kai with surprise.

“I know her from before. She won’t harm us,” Yang Kai explained.

In an instant, dozens of astonished eyes cast upon them, seemingly unable to believe Yang Kai would have connections with such a woman.

“You little bastard...” Meng Wuya admired him to death and waved his hand. The barrier immediately cracked open.

Shan Qingluo and Bilo entered without any guard. The barrier closed quickly behind them.

Before the crowd, Shan Qingluo bowed gracefully. “Greetings, Senior Ling.”

Ling Taixu frowned and said lightly, “I dare not accept such formality. The Enchantress Queen’s fame precedes her. We are both beyond the Divine Roaming Realm; I am unworthy of such a great honor.”

He remained wary of the Evil Kings following Yang Bai. Although Shan Qingluo showed no hostility, Ling Taixu remained on guard.

Shan Qingluo smiled and said, “Senior Ling is Yang Kai’s great-grandmaster, so you are my senior as well. As for Yang Kai and I... hehe...”

Her words trailed off, but the meaning was loaded and intriguing.

Everyone in the residence suddenly wore ambiguous expressions, as if they had discovered something extraordinary. Huo Xingchen and Dong Qinghan smirked mysteriously.

“Don’t say things that can be easily misunderstood,” Yang Kai frowned.

Shan Qingluo pouted slightly, her redness exquisite and enticing.

Bilo behind her snarled fiercely at Yang Kai.

“What’s going on this time?” Yang Kai asked seriously.

“Exactly as you see,” Shan Qingluo replied innocently.

“Why did Cangyun Evil Land suddenly come over like this?”

This matter was too sudden; no one expected it.

Shan Qingluo sighed softly. “You created such a perfect opportunity for our lord. No one else to blame.”

“You mean the Succession War?”

“Of course. This succession war has scattered the power of the Eight Great Families into two pieces, giving space to attack them one by one. Also, your last siege on Sacred Land cost heavy losses. Your Yuan Qi has yet to recover. With such a good opportunity, our lord naturally wants to seize it.”

“Do you think you will succeed?” Yang Kai sneered.

“Whether we succeed, I don’t know,” Shan Qingluo shook her head. “But I do know that with our lord’s current achievement and cultivation, no one among the Eight Great Families can resist him.”

Yang Kai’s face changed. “How strong is he exactly?”

“The greatest person under heaven,” Meng Wuya answered grimly.

“Moreover, the Eight Great Families are not united. Zhongdu is vast, and the families are spread over eight corners. If Sacred Land attacks one family, would the other seven hesitate to come to aid?” Shan Qingluo smiled slyly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted coldly. “Your Cangyun Evil Land isn’t united either!”

Shan Qingluo nodded. “True. The Sacred Land is even more selfish than the Eight Great Families. Without our lord’s coordination, the Six Great Evil Kings would still be enemies. But with him, it’s different. Yang Kai, don’t be too optimistic. This time, our lord is dead set on Zhongdu. He doesn’t care about the lives of those Sacred Land warriors, not even us six Evil Kings. If necessary, I believe he would sacrifice us without hesitation—so long as the Eight Great Families are wiped out.”

“You’re resigned to being his pawns?”

“Not resigned, unable to resist,” Shan Qingluo shook her head sorrowfully.

Yang Kai looked at her, contemplative. After a moment, he said, “Stay here. Yang Bai can’t do anything to you inside this place.”

Shan Qingluo smiled bitterly. “I’m safe here, but what about those in my palace, and those in Piaoxiang City?”

Yang Kai was startled, suddenly recalling the three women who served him before in Shan Qingluo’s palace: the beautiful Yunli and the two girls, Ruoyu and Ruoqing.
