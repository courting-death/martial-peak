## Chapter 1503 — Imperial Treasure

Qian Tong wore a look full of self‑reproach; he had been careless and fallen into enemy hands—so be it—but he had not expected to implicate Yang Kai as well.

"Heh heh, Elder Qian, there's no need to be so distant. When this junior first came to Dark Star over a dozen years ago, I received much of your care. Now that Elder faces trouble, how could I possibly stand by and watch? What's more, this matter began because of me. How could I not step in?" Yang Kai grinned, brilliant and unrestrained.

"Good, good, good!" Fang Peng clapped and laughed aloud at the side. "Sect Master Yang truly is a man of feeling who repays kindness—this old man is ashamed in comparison!"

"Enough nonsense. You've schemed for long and mobilized such a grand lineup, all for this Sect Master. Release them, and this Sect Master will go with you!" Yang Kai looked at Fang Peng with a dark face.

"Heh heh, with Sect Master Yang so cooperative, this old man is endlessly grateful. These people will naturally be released, but to ensure nothing goes awry, please allow me to have men place some restraints on your body. It will prevent any accidents and be to our mutual benefit. What does Sect Master Yang say?" Fang Peng smiled as he watched Yang Kai, a trace of vigilance flashing deep in his eyes.

Yang Kai had agreed far too readily.

That made Fang Peng faintly feel something was amiss.

He had ordered his men to launch a sneak attack to heavily wound Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu and capture the two as a precaution, so that Yang Kai would have scruples. He had not expected Yang Kai would actually surrender himself for Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu. Could this brat really be so noble and righteous? Fang Peng had his doubts.

If it were him, he would never do such a thing. Preserving himself was what mattered most—what were other people's lives worth?

Therefore, until the restraint was placed upon Yang Kai, he could not relax for even a moment.

"No problem!" Yang Kai remained simply forthright. "Sect Master Fang, come."

Fang Peng frowned slightly and cast a meaningful glance. At once, two Third-Stage Origin Returning Realm experts stepped forward, closing in on Yang Kai from the left and right. Both men clearly kept their guard up, wary of a sudden change of heart on his part. Yet even when they came within a mere foot of him, Yang Kai remained motionless, simply staring at them with a mocking expression.

The two flushed, secretly blaming themselves for being overly cautious.

To be so skittish before prey already on the chopping block was truly disgraceful.

Without Fang Peng needing to say anything more, the two formed seals with both hands and, after a flurry of movements, slapped their palms onto Yang Kai.

A fluctuation of sealing power spread out, and the aura around Yang Kai suddenly withered.

Everyone involuntarily breathed out in relief. No matter how heaven‑defying Yang Kai might be, once his Saint Yuan was sealed, he could no longer stir up any waves.

Fang Peng was overjoyed.

Although this operation had cost many men, it was finally ending satisfactorily.

Yet at just this moment, an unforeseen change erupted.

A scorching force suddenly surged from Yang Kai's position, and in the next instant a mass of pitch‑black Demonic Flame wrapped him whole, making him look like a burning, jet‑black fireball.

The aura that had fallen silent on his body soared in a heartbeat to its peak.

"Impossible!" the two experts who had imposed the restraint on Yang Kai cried out, eyes bulging round.

They clearly had not held anything back when they struck; even a cultivator of the same realm would not be able to break free of such an inner restraint in a short time. Just how vast and dense was the Saint Yuan in Yang Kai's body that the restraint they imposed had no effect at all?

Terrified, the two hastily retreated, fearing Yang Kai would strike to kill.

But Yang Kai had no intention of attacking them; his figure merely quivered slightly, as though he were about to depart from where he stood.

"You're not the only one proficient in Spatial Force. This old man anticipated as much—leave it to me!" With an angry shout, the Battle Sky Alliance's Great Elder, Mo Xiaosheng, appeared bizarrely at Yang Kai's side. A strange power fluctuation erupted from his body and covered Yang Kai.

Spatial Force!

While everyone else had relaxed, Mo Xiaosheng had continued to keep a close eye on Yang Kai's movements, allowing him to react this quickly.

He had absolute confidence he could stop Yang Kai! Although he knew Yang Kai had cultivated Spatial Force, he himself had steeped in this field for countless years and was confident he would not lose to a greenhorn. His pride did not allow infringement.

He would prove to everyone who was first in this domain.

Spatial Force surged forth, stirring the void all around Yang Kai. An invisible shackle bound his body, and his almost vanishing figure solidified once more.

Mo Xiaosheng smiled arrogantly.

But in the next heartbeat, his smile stiffened, and he wore a look of blank astonishment.

"Showing off your petty tricks before a master!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. As his words fell, his figure had already vanished.

"How can this be?" Mo Xiaosheng stood there dumbfounded. He did not even know how Yang Kai had broken his spatial blockade and left. A shocking thought suddenly surfaced in his mind, leaving him almost unable to think.

Could this brat's grasp of Spatial Force be even more formidable than his own?

A terrifying fluctuation rippled out. A short, pitch‑black arrow suddenly appeared out of thin air and, with a slight tremor, shot like thunder and lightning straight at Qu Zheng.

The dreadful killing power contained in that little arrow was something no one dared take lightly.

Moreover, earlier, that Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm middle‑aged woman of the Battle Sky Alliance had died miserably under this very sort of attack, without the slightest chance to resist, slain in an instant. Qu Zheng knew full well the power of this short arrow.

Taken by surprise, he did not dare to receive it head‑on. He hurriedly displayed his movement art and dodged from where he stood.

Whoosh—

The jet‑black short arrow scraped past his body and flew on. Not far away, another Origin Returning Realm cultivator became the unlucky bystander—his chest was pierced through by that short arrow, and he died on the spot.

"Where is he?" Fang Peng roared, unleashing his Divine Sense without reservation. Very soon he discovered Yang Kai's trail—at some point Yang Kai had already rushed to a spot not far in front of Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, and was closing in on them at extreme speed.

That short arrow just now had merely been to force Qu Zheng to leave his original position. His true aim was only to rescue Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

"Not good!" Fang Peng's face sank as he barked, "Stop him!"

"Those who block my path die!" Yang Kai bellowed. Raising both hands, he sent out one jet‑black, blade‑like attack after another, slashing toward the two enemies escorting Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

Seeing Yang Kai charge in like a tiger descending the mountain, with momentum like a rainbow, the two could not help but be seized with terror. They wanted to avoid the sharp edge, but with Fang Peng's order given, they had no choice but to grit their teeth and summon their Secret Treasures.

Golden light blossomed. Before the two had time to act, they suddenly noticed a golden halo cover Yang Kai's left eye, within which a long, narrow golden pupil gleamed with boundless majesty.

Within that golden light, a five‑colored glow faintly coiled.

That golden light and five‑colored glow seemed to hold a wondrous power. The two felt their Souls being pulled toward an endless abyss; they trembled uncontrollably, bodies unable to move, mouths unable to speak.

The World‑Ending Demon Eye was the Great Demon God's innate divine ability, and after Yang Kai refined and fused it with the Glazed Pearl Daiyuan had given him back then, the present World‑Ending Demon Eye, paired with the Glazed Light, was even mightier than before.

The World‑Ending Demon Eye possessed a deterrent effect upon the Soul, while the Glazed Light had the power to bind the body and fix the Soul. Used together, they naturally complemented each other.

Although for these two, such intimidation and binding could be thrown off after merely a fleeting moment, it was already enough.

The jet‑black Space Blades passed precisely through their bodies. Without a sound, crescent‑shaped holes bloomed across them.

All their flesh, bones, and internal organs had been banished into the void!

Everything happened in the blink of an eye. From Yang Kai using the strike sealed within the Feather Spirit Arrow to force Qu Zheng back, to cutting down the two who were escorting Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu with Space Blades, it took but an instant.

In the next moment, he was already before Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu. Grabbing one in each hand, he stirred Spatial Force once more, intending to depart on the spot.

But just then, an angry shout rang out.

"Delusional!" From within the crowd, an old man in a brown robe with grizzled hair stepped forth. Saint Yuan surged within him, and a bead only the size of a longan suddenly appeared in his hand.

The instant the bead appeared, everyone changed countenance.

From that bead there actually radiated a presence that made every person shudder in unease. Regardless of its strength, it felt familiar to all.

"Imperial Might!" Fang Peng's eyelids twitched as he cried out in shock.

It was indeed Imperial Might—the very same power that had emanated in the Imperial Garden—only not as strong. That pressure for no reason made one feel lowly and insignificant, as though by pressure alone people could be crushed into dust.

Saint Yuan surged within the gray‑haired elder as, in the shortest time, he poured all of it into the bead in his hand. With a harsh shout, the bead turned into a stream of light and shot rapidly toward Yang Kai.

In midair, the bead split into two, and two into four, and four into eight…

Beads filled the sky, nearly covering all the space around Yang Kai. Nor was that all—each bead was utterly real rather than illusory, flashing with light, arcs of lightning dancing upon them.

A sizzling chorus erupted as those dancing arcs of lightning actually shot out like fine threads, blasting toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed, his expression more solemn than ever before.

From those lightning arcs he sensed the summons of death, as if with the slightest mishandling he would be slain on the spot.

Heart pounding, Yang Kai did not dare be the least bit negligent. The Purple Shield was summoned, turning into a sandstorm to guard the surroundings; the artifact spirit Fire Bird flew out from within his body, transforming into a fiery red light curtain that wrapped him, Qian Tong, and Fei Zhi Tu within.

All of the Golden Blood Threads also shot forth—nearly a hundred in number—entwining and crossing to weave a dense, impenetrable great net before him.

Even after laying down three layers of strong protection in succession, Yang Kai still felt uneasy.

But there was already no time for any further response; those countless arcs of lightning had surged right up to them.
