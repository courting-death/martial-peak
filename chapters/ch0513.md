## Chapter 513 — Who Did It

Scanning the surroundings, Yang Kai immediately noticed the commotion on the side of Lingxiao Pavilion. Although he wasn't entirely clear about what had happened, he sensed something was amiss, and his expression darkened.

“Senior Brother Yang! Senior Sister Su!” Li Yuntian shouted from the depths of his heart. “Junior Young Master Su… Junior Young Master Su has been stabbed!”

Su Yan’s radiant face instantly paled. Her pure figure became a streak of light as she rushed into the crowd, with Yang Kai following closely behind.

As he looked over, his eyes narrowed and his face turned ashen.

Amidst the crowd, Su Mu sat cross-legged on the ground, his face pale. A sharp sword was still embedded in his right chest, piercing straight through. Blood and froth continually dribbled from his mouth and nose. His qi and blood were unstable, and his breathing was labored, like an old bellows struggling to push air in a blacksmith’s forge.

A senior uncle from Lingxiao Pavilion was behind him, pressing his hand to Su Mu’s back, infusing him with True Yuan.

Su Yan’s eyes immediately reddened.

She and Su Mu were siblings. Seeing her younger brother suffer such a tragic fate, how could she not be heartbroken?

Yang Kai pushed aside the crowd and quickly stepped forward. After feeling Su Mu’s wrist a moment, he pried open his mouth and flicked some Wan Yao Ling Milk inside.

The moment the spirit milk entered, Yang Kai pulled out the sword lodged in Su Mu’s right chest, blood spurting along with it.

He then formed several streams of True Yuan, sealing the wound and stemming the bleeding, comforting Su Yan, “He will be fine.”

Su Yan nodded lightly.

With Wan Yao Ling Milk, Su Mu’s life was no longer in danger. He might even benefit from this calamity and strengthen himself. But… had it not been for Su Yan and Yang Kai arriving in time, if delayed half an hour more, Su Mu’s fate would have been uncertain.

Even if he survived, he might be left disabled for life!

Rising slowly, Yang Kai’s expression was steady. He turned to look at Kang Zhan standing nearby.

Kang Zhan suddenly felt his lips grow dry. Yang Kai’s silence made him uneasy, and he realized this situation was likely grave.

“Who did this?” Yang Kai asked Kang Zhan calmly.

Kang Zhan swallowed and hesitated. “Ninth Young Master, this was just an accident…”

“Who did this?”

Kang Zhan frowned. Although he knew Yang Kai’s formidable power, he was the one orchestrating this operation and was also a son of Zhongdu, so he couldn’t show too much fear. In a low voice, he said, “Ninth Young Master, this is the Succession War. Deaths and injuries are inevitable. You and I are at odds. Not to mention that this friend of ours isn’t in mortal danger right now, even if he did die it wouldn’t matter. There’s no shortage of men who have died by your hand.”

“That’s true,” Yang Kai nodded. “I have killed many. If their families want revenge, they can come and find me. Now someone has harmed mine—I want revenge too. So I must know who did it.”

Kang Zhan was momentarily stumped. Indeed, revenge begets revenge. How can you kill and harm and then prevent others from retaliation? Moreover, the two sides had agreed that people from Lingxiao Pavilion would not interfere in this battle.

Given that premise, someone from Lingxiao Pavilion being severely injured meant Kang Zhan was at a disadvantage.

Still, he could not betray his own people; that would make him seem spineless and afraid of Yang Kai.

“It was that person!” Li Yuntian suddenly stood up, fury filling his voice as he pointed aside, “The two groups that came from there just now—someone from them wanted to kill Junior Young Master Su!”

Following his finger, Yang Kai’s gaze fell on Nan Sheng not far off.

Kang Zhan frowned. Suddenly, he realized Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu had slipped away and returned to their own side unnoticed.

While he stayed behind to clean up their mess, they quietly escaped. Kang Zhan felt a surge of anger.

“I understand now!” Yang Kai nodded slightly, casting a sidelong glance at Kang Zhan. “Young Master Kang, I warned you that Lingxiao Pavilion members must not interfere for your own good. If they were harmed, I would unleash a bloodbath. Looks like you don’t fully believe me.”

Kang Zhan was stunned, then his eyes filled with terror.

He noticed Yang Kai’s aura suddenly turned wild and bloodthirsty, the oppressive killing intent shooting into the heavens.

Instinctively, Kang Zhan hastily stepped back.

Yang Kai’s cold gaze locked on him, then with a flick of his hand, the long sword pulled from Su Mu’s chest, wrapped in a chilling light, shot fiercely toward Kang Zhan.

Kang Zhan’s face changed drastically, not expecting Yang Kai to act so decisively. He hurriedly deployed a Martial Skill to defend, but the sword contained destructive power far beyond his level, and could not be stopped.

Thud…

Kang Zhan gasped. The sword pierced through his right chest just as it had Su Mu’s. The immense force pushed him back more than ten paces before he barely regained his footing.

His eyes trembled as he stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Everyone was silent, their faces filled with shock and horror.

Since the Succession War began, this was the first time a son from one of the Zhongdu Eight Great Families had been wounded—badly wounded at that!

Sons of the Eight Great Families usually would never get injured in the Succession War, let alone face mortal danger. No one dared to kill them outright; the worst was to defeat them and force a retreat.

But now, this precedent, maintained for countless years, had been broken.

Kang Zhan stared blankly at the sword in his chest, the pain gradually spreading. Even now, he could not believe Yang Kai had such nerve—he was utterly lawless.

“Ninth Young Master…” Kang Zhan muttered, blood bitter in his mouth, his breathing labored.

Yang Kai cast him a cold glance. “If you weren’t of the Eight Great Families, you’d be dead today.”

Kang Zhan’s face twitched, a chill engulfing him. Afraid to show bravado, he hurriedly sat cross-legged, taking out a pill to hide his wound.

The howling wind stirred as Yang Kai strode forward like a mountain steeped in blood. Everyone felt the aura of death bearing down on them.

This group from the Yang Zhao Mansion—aside from Kang Zhan who was frozen stiff while healing, and the dozen or so experts restrained by Ying Jiu—they had all gathered here now.

Led by Qiu Ziru, the crowd stared over in terror.

“What do we do? What do we do?” Qiu Ziru’s face went pale as he repeatedly questioned those around him.

This operation was originally under Kang Zhan’s command, but now that he was incapacitated, the burden naturally fell on Qiu Ziru.

Facing Yang Kai, who was so formidable he had severely wounded Kang Zhan, Qiu Ziru had no resolve to resist. He feared suffering the same fate.

Without any plan, what hope did the others have?

“Nan Sheng, you caused this mess. Tell me, what do we do now?” Qiu Ziru angrily snapped at Nan Sheng.

Nan Sheng’s previous arrogance was gone. Hearing this, he looked dazed, lips dry and pressed together, silent.

In contrast, Xiang Chu’s eyes flashed with contempt and cruelty as he spoke: “Young Master Qiu, no matter how strong Yang Kai is, he’s only one man. Why fear him? Besides, Young Master Kang has said it himself: this is the Succession War. Losing one or two people is normal. The injured man isn’t even dead. Yang Kai is making a mountain out of a molehill. Even if word reaches Zhongdu, he won’t hold the ground. This is a perfect chance to eliminate Yang Kai. Young Master Qiu, you must seize it. We stand ready for orders.”

“Bullshit!” Qiu Ziru shouted. “Yang Kai and Young Master Kang warned you not to provoke Lingxiao Pavilion. You still acted. And Yang Kai held back on us just now, but you—damn your ancestors!” 

Xiang Chu sneered, disappointed by Qiu Ziru’s timidity.

Before their conversation ended, Yang Kai had already walked twenty zhang ahead of them, alone and unafraid amid the forces of seven families.

Although the pinnacle experts of these factions were restrained, there were still many, some at the Divine Roaming Realm.

“Qiu Ziru.” Yang Kai called out loudly, “You are the younger brother of Qiu Yimeng. I do not wish to trouble you. Step aside.”

A trace of joy appeared on Qiu Ziru’s face as he was about to agree, but he suddenly reconsidered and shook his head hurriedly. “Ninth Young Master, I am afraid I cannot comply with that request.”

Yang Kai nodded, “At least you have some backbone.”

Without further words, his hand suddenly flashed with radiant light, revealing a bone shield imbued with chilling yin energy.

“That is that Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure!” Qiu Ziru and the others’ expressions shifted slightly.

Yang Kai had used this bone shield during the assault on Yang Kang’s Mansion, and just moments ago, so they knew well its formidable defense and ability to absorb energy attacks.

With this bone shield in hand, Yang Kai’s defense was almost impregnable.

But now, by raising it, Yang Kai puzzled them. They secretly wondered if he intended to defend.

Before they could finish their thoughts, a dangerous aura suddenly spread through the world.

On that bone shield flickered black lightning. From the gaping beast mouth in its center, energy surged wildly.

Swish, swish, swish…

A series of electric dragons, each as thick as a human leg and nearly a dozen zhang long, shot out from the beast’s mouth.

They writhed vividly, full of life, brimming with destructive power as they charged toward the gathering of the seven factions.

“How is this possible?” Qiu Ziru exclaimed in shock.

Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures come in many types—defensive, offensive, auxiliary.

The bone shield Yang Kai wielded was clearly for defense, so how did it become an offensive weapon now?

And this brand of electric dragons seemed familiar somehow.

“This is the power of Yang Kang’s Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure!” Xiang Chu screeched. Suddenly realizing, the bone shield in Yang Kai’s hands not only absorbs attacks but can unleash the absorbed energy in counterattacks.

These electric dragons were the ones Yang Kang had unleashed over two months ago during his duel with Yang Kai.

At that time, Yang Kai had absorbed them with the bone shield. Only now, more than two months later, was he releasing them here.
