## Chapter 1284 — Indeed, She Has Some Tricks

The moment Yin Sudie coldly snorted, those girls with resentful gazes suddenly surged toward Yang Kai; one by one their soft, boneless white arms undulated like spirit snakes, raising vast sheets of pink mist that wrapped around Yang Kai.

Within that mist the girls flitted like flowers and butterflies, their forms gradually blurring until they vanished without a trace, yet the surrounding melody abruptly turned martial and thunderous, clashing like steel and horse-hooves; the music carried a thick killing intent, wildly tugging at the violent impulses buried deep in Yang Kai’s heart, trying to throw him off balance.

At the same time, the pink mist, as if possessing will, seeped through Yang Kai’s pores and silently invaded his body, affecting his judgment and the circulation of his Saint Yuan.

Seeing he could not be beguiled, Yin Sudie immediately abandoned her earlier plan and prepared to act with force.

She did not really expect to do anything to Yang Kai—she only intended to buy time so her Senior Brother Luo could seize Yang Yan.

In the pink mist Yang Kai’s expression turned grave as a lump of pitch-black flame, full of scorching might, burst forth from his body and blazed fiercely; every wisp of pink that came near him vanished as if it had met its nemesis.

Yet the origin of those mists was unclear and they were endless; even when burned by the scorching Demonic Flame they surged on like moths to a flame.

From among the mist faint, beautiful figures suddenly launched a sneak attack — these shadows were the young maidens who had disappeared earlier; they emerged from the most uncanny angles at the most undefendable moments and, with a flick, whipped out strands of pink ribbons toward Yang Kai.

For a moment Yang Kai was indeed tightly bound by those pink ribbons, and the ribbons themselves were extremely odd: though the Demonic Flame burned them, they showed no sign of damage.

This aroused Yang Kai’s interest; looking closely he discovered the clue — those pink ribbons were not formed from mist at all, but produced by an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure that Yin Sudie had conjured at some unknown moment; the treasure’s color and shape matched her Charm Technique so well that the result was indistinguishable from reality, which had fooled Yang Kai.

Moreover, the ribbons bound him in a way that faintly interfered with Saint Yuan circulation; the protective layer of Demonic Flame around Yang Kai immediately weakened considerably.

Giggling sounded from all directions with no discernible source, then the ribbons tightened as if to bind Yang Kai into a bundle.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, grabbed one of the ribbons coiling around his body, and brutally yanked it toward himself; in an instant a graceful figure was dragged out of the mist by that force.

Before the shadow could come close, Yang Kai’s other hand had already formed a fist and slammed directly into that delicate body.

A piercing, miserable scream seemed to sound in his ear; amid the churning mist a young maiden’s tender form burst into a blossom of blood and then, like foam, vanished from Yang Kai’s sight, dissolving into the surrounding fog and thickening the pink hue.

Seeing this method worked, Yang Kai’s body immediately spun like a top, the tremendous force pulling the maidens at the other ends of the ribbons toward him; they cried out in distress as they were dragged to his side.

Balls of pitch-black Demonic Flame flew from Yang Kai’s hand and struck those phantoms that were not living beings; cries rang out one after another as the maidens’ images exploded into blood mist and vanished.

At the instant those maidens were shattered, Yang Kai seemed to hear a faint hum from Yin Sudie.

It seemed his recent actions had inflicted some blow on the Charm Technique Yin Sudie had employed.

Yin Sudie indeed suffered a slight backlash from her own Charm Technique; she had not expected Yang Kai to be so ruthless, utterly lacking any pity for delicate femininity.

Had it been other men trapped in her charm formation, even knowing the maidens were false, they likely would not have executed such decisive slaughter; given a bit more time she could have cast another variation — one not merely for restraining enemies but with powerful killing force; she had planned to use such a change to stall Yang Kai for the length of a teacup’s time.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai treated the maidens conjured by her Charm Technique as nothing and cleaned them all up without hesitation; Yin Sudie, caught off guard, immediately suffered a slight backlash.

Although the backlash was not severe enough to affect her following combat, a streak of unyielding ferocity rose in Yin Sudie’s beautiful eyes as she hissed, “Senior Brother Hou!”

“Understood!” The martial artist surnamed Hou who had been meditating behind Yin Sudie rose at once; in a flash he vanished into the pink mist.

At the same time Yin Sudie’s Divine Sense moved, and within the vast mist wrapping Yang Kai there appeared once more a number of exquisite figures — this time different from before, each clutching a different weapon that gave off not-insubstantial energy ripples; some figures even wore gleaming treasure armor.

Yang Kai was slightly taken aback.

Though he despised Yin Sudie’s repeated attempts to use her Charm Technique on him, he also knew she wouldn’t be foolish enough to repeat the same ploy; he had clearly torn those figures apart earlier — so what was she doing now?

What puzzled Yang Kai most were the weapons those newly appeared figures held.

While he was bewildered, a girl to one side suddenly waved a small fan in her hand and lightly fanned toward Yang Kai.

The little fan looked unremarkable, embroidered with patterns of birds and beasts.

But beneath that single fan-stroke came a beastly roar, and black rays shot from the fan’s surface, twisting and changing into demonic beasts, some large and some small.

Those demonic beasts took on the shapes of the patterns on the fan; once the beasts appeared, the fan’s surface was left empty.

There were more than thirty of these demonic beasts, some as large as buildings, others as slender as spirit snakes; once they appeared they charged straight at Yang Kai.

“Illusions?” Yang Kai’s brow furrowed and his expression turned stern as a long sword wreathed in rolling Demonic Flame materialized in his hand; with a flick he unleashed a rain of sword radiance.

A hissing of broken air rang out — some of the thirty-plus beasts were cleaved in two before they could evade, while the more agile ones slipped aside and continued their assault; the bodies of those cut in two dissolved into black gas, recombined, twisted, and astonishingly reformed as if unharmed.

Yet on closer inspection their coloration was somewhat dimmer than before — they had not been entirely unscathed.

In the blink of an eye Yang Kai found himself surrounded by a dozen or so beasts; one, the size of a building, resembled a qilin with towering limbs and flaming paws; it raised a huge claw and slammed down on Yang Kai.

Before the paw fell, an immense pressure descended as if to press Yang Kai flat as a pancake.

Yang Kai did not dodge; to test his hypothesis he threw a punch upward.

His fist, wrapped in Demonic Flame, struck the monstrous beast’s leg and sent it flying; Yang Kai’s body jolted and he staggered back several steps, and in that instant the other beasts leapt and swarmed over him.

Outside, Yin Sudie’s mouth couldn’t help curling into a self-satisfied smile, but that smile had barely formed before it stiffened.

Within the pink mist the cluster of beasts that had engulfed Yang Kai suddenly detonated with a burst of black radiance; all the demonic beasts whimpered and were hurled outward by a great force, scattering in all directions.

“Not illusions! Fine, fine — the Liuli Sect’s chief disciple truly has some means!” Yang Kai’s low shout rang out.

Only now did he finally confirm that the little fan and the beasts were not illusions: the fan was a Secret Treasure and the beasts were its manifested power — both real. Not only the fan, but the weapons the maidens held were all real Secret Treasures.

In this pink mist, only the maidens themselves were conjured by the Charm Technique, existing in a state between real and unreal.

“Little Brother, don’t struggle — obediently come with me!” Yin Sudie’s pretty face chilled as she coquettishly demanded, seeing how troublesome Yang Kai had become.

“If you want me to go with you, let's see if you have the ability!” Yang Kai sneered repeatedly; as his words fell his figure shimmered and vanished from where he stood, and at the same time a lightning-flashing long whip lashed the spot where he had been, thunder cracking ceaselessly.

But no sooner had Yang Kai’s figure reappeared than another flash darted before his eyes, stabbing toward his face; though the strike was blindingly fast, Yang Kai still made out a dagger-shaped Secret Treasure hurled by one of the girls that landed in front of him as if he had run into it.

Yang Kai flew into a rage, reached out a large hand wreathed in Demonic Flame, and grabbed the dagger.

He snorted coldly, Saint Yuan surging, and the Demonic Flame’s might rose to a towering peak, completely enveloping the dagger.

It was plainly a high-grade piece — a Saint King-Grade, Upper-Level Secret Treasure dagger — yet like snow beneath a blazing sun it quickly melted away.

In the blink of an eye the dagger had become a puddle of molten iron that slid from Yang Kai’s fingertips.

Having confirmed these Secret Treasures were real, Yang Kai naturally knew what to do. This Yin Sudie had pestered him incessantly and enraged him; it was the perfect chance to teach her a lesson and show her the consequences of provoking him.

Seeing a Saint King-Grade Secret Treasure so easily destroyed, the remaining maidens’ expressions froze — perhaps because their minds were connected to Yin Sudie and reflected her shock.

Seizing the opportunity, Yang Kai let out a feral laugh and lunged at the maidens.

In an instant cries rang out; the maidens nimbly scattered and triggered the powers of their Secret Treasures, raining attacks down on Yang Kai — the battle continued.
