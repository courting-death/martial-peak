## Chapter 2560 — The Blood Gate Incident

After a long silence, Zhang Ruoxi summoned her courage and began circulating her cultivation technique once more.

This time, she paid close attention and discovered that cultivating here allowed her to absorb not only Spiritual Qi but also Primordial Power into her body. Strangely enough, both energies were extremely beneficial to her, especially the Primordial Power, which gave her a craving she couldn’t resist.

What was happening? Was something wrong with her body? This was Primordial Power, after all...

Suddenly, Zhang Ruoxi grew fearful and stopped cultivating, ceasing the flow of her technique. She sat quietly in place, her expression filled with uncertainty and alarm.

She truly couldn’t find a reason for this. The only possible explanation was her bloodline, since her master had said her bloodline was peculiar and its inheritance was unknown.

She herself found it odd, as the cultivation technique she used was one she had comprehended on her own, not taught by the Zhang Family. It seemed as if it was engraved deep in her mind, and once she began cultivating, she instinctively knew how to circulate her energy.

Sitting there in silence, Zhang Ruoxi found herself with nothing to do. The world around her was utterly still, peaceful and quiet.

Zhang Ruoxi thought for a moment, then took out the Ethereal Jade Disc from her Spatial Ring. Before entering this place, her master had entrusted it to her, telling her to study it carefully, as it might unlock the secret of her bloodline power.

As soon as she brought it out, Zhang Ruoxi’s body suddenly trembled, and she looked up in a certain direction.

That feeling returned!

Somehow, something was resonating with the Ethereal Jade Disc in her hand, calling out to her from afar, making her blood race and her body burn with heat.

She had felt this sensation once before. Experiencing it again now, Zhang Ruoxi was certain it wasn’t an illusion.

But it lasted only a moment. When Zhang Ruoxi tried to sense it again, she found nothing.

The Ethereal Jade Disc still flashed with beautiful scenery. Zhang Ruoxi turned it over and studied it for a long time, but she remained clueless about its purpose.

......

Within the dense jungle, in the deepest reaches of the Wild Ancient Land.

This was the true heart of the Primordial Land, a place no human had ever set foot upon. For hundreds of millions of years, only the countless remnants of the Primordial Era had lived here, multiplying and enduring without end.

It was like another world entirely, completely different from the Four Territories of the Star Realm.

Atop a towering mountain, an oval object shimmered brilliantly, radiating a blood-red glow. Its surface was crimson throughout, as though forged from fresh blood itself, yet from it drifted a strange, alluring fragrance.

The Blood Gate!

All the yao living deep in the Primordial Land knew of the Blood Gate, but none could enter it, nor did they know what secrets it concealed.

Yet, rumors in the Ancient Land claimed that within the Blood Gate lay the mystery that could allow its inhabitants to evolve into Divine Spirits. The current Ancient Land creatures all carried traces of Ancient Divine Spirit blood in their bodies, though the amount varied.

Even the most ordinary little snake, if traced back far enough, might have a connection to the Dragon Clan.

Once the ancient blood hidden within their bodies was awakened, the creatures of the Ancient Land could gain power equal to their ancestral Divine Spirits. Throughout history, among billions of beings, how many have truly unearthed their bloodline’s power and evolved into Divine Spirits?

At most, not more than two handfuls.

Yet among the Ancient Land’s tribes, the legend persisted that the Blood Gate possessed a mysterious power, allowing any yao or primordial remnant who entered to fully unlock their bloodline. If successful, they had a great chance to restore their ancestors’ glory and evolve into Divine Spirits.

Because of this legend, the Blood Gate’s location became the Sacred Land of all the Ancient Land’s tribes. Countless beings who believed in their strength or fate rushed forward, hoping to awaken their bloodline through the Blood Gate.

But none ever succeeded.

Not even approaching the Blood Gate was possible. Any Ancient Land creature who came within ten li of it would melt into a pool of pus, dying a miserable death.

Once, a powerful Yao King at the peak of the Twelfth-Tier came here before his end, hoping for one last chance. His lifespan was nearly over, and without a solution, he would soon die of old age.

The Blood Gate was his final hope.

Twelfth-Tier peak was equivalent to a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert among humans. In the entire Star Realm, how many such beings existed?

Yet, even with all his strength, he only managed to reach three li from the Blood Gate, unable to advance further. After three days and nights, he too melted into pus, his soul scattered.

Since then, no Ancient Land creature dared approach the Blood Gate. If even a Twelfth-Tier peak Yao King couldn’t enter and awaken his bloodline, who else would dare try?

The Blood Gate became a forbidden land in the Ancient Land. No creature dared approach, fearing a senseless death.

Though this happened long ago, the Ancient Land’s creatures—whether yao or primordial remnants—lived extremely long lives. Many Yao Kings and local overlords had witnessed the Twelfth-Tier peak Yao King’s tragic fate firsthand, and under their stern warnings, their followers never dared approach the Blood Gate.

At this moment, the Blood Gate atop the towering mountain, unchanged for countless years, suddenly burst forth with dazzling red light. The red glow gathered into a pillar, piercing the clouds and leaving a huge hole in the sky.

But soon, the pillar vanished, leaving only scattered red sparks that gradually faded in midair.

A hundred li from the Blood Gate, a pitch-black python was coiling its prey tightly, strangling it before swallowing it whole.

Its gaze was fixed on the Blood Gate’s location.

It had witnessed the sudden rise and fall of the red pillar of light.

The python’s eyes widened, staring at the Blood Gate in terror.

It couldn’t help but be afraid—the Blood Gate’s legend was too frightening. For so many years, it had stood unchanged, and now this happened. Who wouldn’t be anxious?

But the incident passed quickly and didn’t affect it, so it felt somewhat relieved.

After waiting a long time without moving, and seeing no further changes at the Blood Gate, the python suddenly twisted its body. With a series of bone-cracking sounds, its five zhang-long form underwent a dramatic transformation.

In the blink of an eye, the python turned into a middle-aged man with a dark complexion, dressed in black robes, his eyes cold and sinister.

His mouth was still a gaping maw full of fangs, and he still held his prey between his teeth, looking as terrifying as ever.

With a slurp, the python-turned-man swallowed his prey, his belly instantly bulging as if he was pregnant. He slapped his stomach, and it immediately shrank back down.

“Something big has happened—I must report to the master!”

The middle-aged man muttered darkly, his Yao Qi surging as he transformed into a streak of black light, speeding off into the distance.

Judging by the power he radiated, he was at the Eleventh-Tier, roughly equal to a Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

An hour later, a streak of black light sped across the land, rapidly approaching the foot of a towering mountain. It shot straight toward the mountain gate, growing clearer as it drew near.

Two yao guards at the gate immediately grew alert. One brandished a bone hammer, the other held two bone spikes, both glaring at the black light.

“Who goes there!” the yao with the bone hammer shouted, pointing ahead. “This is the sleeping palace of the Yao King Xi Lei. Show yourself, or you’ll be killed without mercy!”

“Killed without mercy!” echoed the yao with the bone spikes, his aura fierce.

The black light stopped not far from them, revealing the middle-aged man who had been the python.

“I’m one of us, brothers. I also serve Lord Xi Lei and have urgent news to report. Please pass word to the master,” the man said, cupping his hands.

The two gatekeeping yao exchanged glances, eyeing him suspiciously. It wasn’t their fault—there were so many yao here, and the Yao King Xi Lei commanded over a hundred thousand yao spread across tens of thousands of li. Aside from those they saw regularly, who could recognize everyone?

Besides, not just anyone could meet the Yao King Xi Lei.

The yao with the bone spikes snorted, “You say you’re one of us? What proof do you have?”

The middle-aged man seemed prepared for this, quickly taking something from his Spatial Ring and respectfully handing it over.

Yao naturally couldn’t refine Spatial Rings, but plenty of humans came here to die. When human cultivators perished, yao would seize their rings.

The middle-aged man had killed a human cultivator and taken a Spatial Ring, storing his belongings inside for convenience.

Human brains were clever, and the Secret Treasures and Spiritual Pills they refined were excellent. Unfortunately, yao couldn’t make them.

The yao with the bone hammer took the item and found it was a bone token. On the front was an image of a four-hooved rhino charging forward; on the back, a large character for thunder.

This was a token made by the Yao King Xi Lei. Though crude, it couldn’t be easily imitated, as the material came from the bones of the same Demonic Beast.

The gatekeeping yao had seen many such tokens and immediately recognized it as genuine.

Not many yao possessed this token—among the hundred thousand, only about two thousand had one. It was a mark of status.

So when the middle-aged man produced the bone token, the gatekeepers’ expressions improved. The yao with the bone spikes said, “Even if you serve the master, you can’t go in. The master said not to disturb him over small matters. If it’s important, we can pass the message.”

The middle-aged man said urgently, “This is no small matter—I must speak to the master in person.”

If this went well, it would be a great achievement. How could he let someone else take credit?
