## Chapter 1434 — Five Elements Converge

Receiving Yang Kai's order, the Stone Puppet immediately rose, slammed both fists hard against its chest twice, then darted to the Divine Stone, seized it with both hands and shoved it into its mouth.

To be fair, the Stone Puppet's mouth was not large, yet strangely that basin-sized Divine Stone was somehow swallowed by it, leaving Ye Xijun staring dumbfounded.

......

One hour later, inside Tianyi Palace, Yang Kai sat cross-legged with a delighted expression; in front of him six kinds of materials were laid out.

A length of vibrant wood crackling with lightning, each verdant leaf seeming to have arcs of lightning dancing upon them — this was the Thundertree Yang Kai had preserved for a long time. This Thundertree had formed from the coagulation of the flesh essence and Inner Core of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast, the Thunder Luan, after its death; by chance it had come into being. In terms of value it was far more precious than the Inner Core of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast. Though it contained lightning, at its root it was still a wood-element material.

A palm-sized piece of metal, obtained at the Jubao Tower auction for seventy million Saint Crystals: Xuan Gold, its golden qi sharp and substantial, even stinging Yang Kai's skin.

A vial of milky-white liquid emitting bitter cold — the Profound Yin Moon Water Yang Kai had not yet finished using. Judging from the amount, there were at least a dozen drops.

A massive ice jade altar, pure and flawless, appearing unremarkable at first glance; yet if swept with Divine Sense, the cold contained within could freeze a consciousness — truly terrifying. Upon the ice jade altar sat a piece of crimson metal the size of an infant's head; to the naked eye it showed no clue, yet the searing heat stored within was shocking.

Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade and the Sun's True Essence!

Aside from that, there was a small pile of grit-like substance—no fewer than a hundred grains in all. At first glance, they looked no different from ordinary sand, yet they were in fact the Dayan Divine Sand that the Stone Puppet had extracted from within the Dayan Divine Stone.

That the Dayan Divine Stone had given birth to such a quantity of Dayan Divine Sand not only filled Yang Kai with joy but even surprised Yang Yan; she had thought twenty or thirty pieces would be good, yet the final count turned out to be several times what she had expected.

Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth gathered together! There was even an extra water-attributed heavenly treasure.

These six materials were each worth an incalculable sum and rarely encountered. Now they were all laid before Yang Kai — how could he not be pleased?

With them, he could cultivate the Undying Five Elements Sword.

Of these materials, if judged purely by value, the Thundertree and Xuan Gold were undoubtedly somewhat inferior, while the most precious was that infant-head-sized piece of Sun's True Essence; after all, the Sun's True Essence was said to be the product of an extraordinary expert refining a star. If the energy within such a small piece of Sun's True Essence were unleashed, obliterating the entire Dark Star would be nothing.

Staring at the materials, Yang Kai drew a deep breath to calm his excitement, furrowed his brow slightly, and fell into contemplation.

The Undying Five Elements Sword is a cultivation method specialized in tempering the body. A fair amount of time had passed since he obtained it, and Yang Kai had naturally studied it thoroughly; strictly speaking, the technique wasn't profoundly abstruse — on the contrary, it was rather straightforward. The difficulty lay only in gathering the materials and the process of cultivation itself.

Moreover, using different materials yields different results. This is the Undying Five Elements Sword's greatest adaptability; in other words, the higher-grade the materials, the better the cultivation's effects.

Needless to say, the Sun's True Essence ranked as the top material, unrivaled!

Profound Yin Moon Water and Divine Sand were almost extinct rarities; the Thundertree and Xuan Gold, though slightly inferior, were by no means low-grade.

Starting cultivation with these materials would give him an exceptionally high starting point. He believed that even if others in the Star Domain obtained the Undying Five Elements Sword, they might not have the same advantage he did.

Buoyed by excitement, Yang Kai began to etch the formation right there.

To cultivate the Undying Five Elements Sword one must employ a special formation; the technique explained this clearly, detailing how to etch and how to manipulate the formation.

Although Yang Kai was not an expert in formations, having spent so much time with Yang Yan he had picked up a rudimentary level, so drawing the formation was not overly difficult for him.

Origin Saint Crystals were placed one after another in orderly fashion, and the five materials of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth were arranged around as required.

Two days later, Yang Kai looked with satisfaction at the Undying Five Elements formation he had painstakingly arranged; after a careful inspection to ensure there were no mistakes, he leapt into the formation's exact center and sat cross-legged.

He casually brushed his Spatial Ring, took out a few Spiritual Pills, held them on his tongue, then closed his eyes tightly and began to circulate the cultivation method of the Undying Five Elements Sword.

His Saint Yuan roared into motion; centered on where Yang Kai sat, the ground around him suddenly shimmered, a series of complex and profound patterns lighting up, within which symbols large and small flickered into view, appearing inscrutable.

A vibrating hum echoed as the Origin Saint Crystals in the Undying Five Elements formation bloomed with dazzling radiance; the pure energies contained within poured forth and, following the patterns, began to circulate.

With the supplement of energy from the Origin Saint Crystals, Yang Kai's formation instantly activated.

An indescribable sensation spread through his entire body as an ancient, desolate profound intent filled all of Tianyi Palace. In that instant, it felt as though Yang Kai had returned to a primordial era long lost to time.

Whistling sounds rose as Xuan Gold, Thundertree, Profound Yin Moon Water, Sun's True Essence, and Dayan Divine Sand — the five heavenly treasures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth — were in that instant seemingly empowered by an invisible force; streams of pure energy were drawn from them and, under the Undying Five Elements formation's effect, converged toward the center.

At the very center was where Yang Kai sat.

In an instant the entire Tianyi Palace turned into a riot of colors.

The azure root essence of the Thundertree, the golden root essence of Xuan Gold, the white root essence of Profound Yin Moon Water, the crimson root essence of Sun's True Essence, the yellow root essence of Dayan Divine Sand… all seemed sentient as they drilled into Yang Kai's body.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s body trembled uncontrollably, his tightly shut eyes snapping wide open. A low, guttural growl escaped his throat, like that of a wounded beast desperately licking its wounds.

A searing agony, beyond imagination, erupted from every part of his body, making Yang Kai feel as if his very bones were shattering. This pain was unlike any injury sustained in battle—it pierced straight into the depths of his soul, shaking him to his core.

In an instant Yang Kai understood why the requirements for cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword were so severe.

If the body's strength were insufficient, once the core forces of these five heavenly treasures burst into the body, one would instantly explode — no question of cultivation!

If one's Divine Sense was not strong enough, one could not withstand such agony; sooner or later the pain would drive one insane and lead to Qi Deviation.

Yang Kai felt his conditions met the requirements, yet upon actually cultivating he found some assumptions were naive; his long-standing pride in his endurance proved no match for this soul-extracting torment, nearly causing him to collapse on the spot.

Of course, this was also related to the fact that the materials he had chosen were too high-grade; had everything been Thundertree-level, the pain likely would not have been so severe.

But this also stimulated Yang Kai's nerves — since he first set foot on the cultivation path, how many times had he teetered on the brink of life and death, how many times had he been grievously wounded and faced ruin, yet step by step he had come through.

If he failed here, all the years of effort would be in vain.

Back when he first obtained the Wordless Black Book in Lingxiao Pavilion, it was solely by relying on his own perseverance that he had managed to make it recognize him as its master, unlocking it and thereby obtaining the Indomitable Golden Body.

That Indomitable Will was a mysterious Martial Skill he had comprehended in the face of desperation. Though as his strength grew it had gradually lost its practical use, it was still a technique he had derived from the Indomitable Golden Body.

A martial skill that belonged to him!

And the birth of that Martial Skill had much to do with Su Yan; it was she who froze him for several days with her methods, enabling him to comprehend it.

A host of distracting thoughts flashed through Yang Kai's mind; by reflex he called upon the Unyielding Will, and to his surprise the pain lessened slightly — barely noticeable, yet it truly did lessen.

Moved, Yang Kai immediately retreated his Spirit Body into the Sea of Consciousness, guarding the Sea of Consciousness's stability tightly and no longer paying attention to external or bodily changes.

Crackling sounds, dense as the snapping of beans, rang out; in Tianyi Palace Yang Kai's skin cracked inch by inch, exuding pale golden blood that soaked his clothes in an instant.

Not only did flesh writhe and skin split, even his meridians could not endure the ravages of the five heavenly treasures' root forces and snapped one after another.

The Golden Blood's powerful regenerative ability manifested thoroughly at that moment.

The cracked skin, torn muscles, and broken meridians were all completely healed in the blink of an eye, only to crack and burst again, repeating endlessly.

As time passed and the process continued, Yang Kai's body visibly grew stronger; moreover, his Saint Yuan seemed to become purer and mightier, and even his Divine Sense gained some tempering.

Although the Undying Five Elements Sword focuses on tempering the body, during cultivation it inevitably also enhances Saint Yuan and Divine Sense — a beneficial side effect.

One after another earth-shattering, pitiable low roars issued from Tianyi Palace; fortunately, layers of restrictions guarded the place, preventing the sound from leaking out, otherwise it would surely have drawn all of Lingxiao Sect.

Time flowed on; the entire Dark Star was hurrying to prepare for entry into the Imperial Garden. One Imperial Jade equaled one slot, and the major powers had only a few Imperial Jades between them; deciding who would enter was a difficult choice. Therefore many forces began internal selection to seize the slots.

Lingxiao Sect was also extremely busy. The sect had three Imperial Jades and so required no selection, but many preparations were still necessary. Only Yang Kai in Tianyi Palace had not appeared since the day he went into seclusion.
