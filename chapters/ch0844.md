## Chapter 844 — Little Trickster

After an examination, Fei Yu's furrowed brows gradually relaxed. She shook her head and said, "Probably nothing wrong. Your True Yuan is both pure and vigorous; it rivals even our Senior Uncle's. Still, to be safe, I'll have Cang Yan and the others take a look in a bit."

Saying so, she let her graceful hips settle onto the seat, looking at Yang Kai with a mix of irritation and amusement as she asked, "What have you been doing these past few years? After you left Fuyun City, you never came back!"

"I..."

Yang Kai had barely opened his mouth when Fei Yu interrupted, "Don't rush to tell everything yet. Cang Yan and the others will definitely want to know—I already sent a message; they should be here soon. But you better brace yourself; those three rotten men said they'd teach you a lesson once you returned."

"Oh." Yang Kai scratched his head and fell silent, sitting on the stone bench with an awkward restraint.

Seeing his ashamed look, Fei Yu couldn't continue pressing him. She softened her voice to comfort him and produced a treasured spirit fruit to place on the table.

Not even half a teacup of time had passed before rapid footsteps sounded from outside.

"They're here." Fei Yu smiled lightly, assuming a look of anticipation as if watching a show—chin cupped in her hand, elbow on the stone table, utterly languid, her beautiful eyes bright.

She seemed quite eager to see Yang Kai get lectured by Cang Yan and the others.

Yang Kai's expression grew solemn; he sat up straight and stared fixedly toward the entrance.

Moments later, three figures burst in almost together: Cang Yan, Li Wan, and Fei Jian, the three senior uncles.

The moment they entered, Li Wan shouted, "I heard that brat's back?"

Cang Yan wore a grim face, as if a storm were about to break; Fei Jian twirled his finger and threads of light flickered from his fingertip, hinting at danger.

All three pairs of eyes snapped onto Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sprang up, laughing as he cried, "Congratulations to my Senior Uncles on attaining the Saint Realm! It is a great blessing for our Tianxiao Sect—your wisdom and valor will surely be renowned. Congratulations, congratulations!"

Fei Yu paused, pinched her lips into an amused smile, and muttered, "Little trickster!"

The three exchanged glances and could only smile wryly. Though they had planned to give Yang Kai a good scolding, their real concern had been for his safety; seeing him unharmed, how could they truly stay angry?

At his words, they all broke into laughter, shaking their heads.

Besides, Yang Kai had contributed to their breakthroughs to the Saint Realm—had he not refined the medicinal liquid from the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, Cang Yan and the others would have reached this level only years later.

"You little punk!" Cang Yan's stern face melted like snow under the sun. He laughed and scolded, then stepped forward and slapped Yang Kai hard on the shoulder, eyes appraising him before saying, "Good, good, good—no missing arms or legs, that's enough!"

"You look a lot sturdier than before." Li Wan grinned.

Fei Jian narrowed his eyes, "Your aura is also very solid."

"Looks like you've grown a good deal while you were out—that's great!"

The senior uncles traded plain words that nonetheless carried deep care. Yang Kai felt a warm glow in his chest.

Once the big men finished their small talk, Fei Yu snorted and chided, "You three have just entered the Saint Realm and you didn't think to check the true cultivation of your junior nephew?"

"What's wrong with his cultivation?" Cang Yan frowned, releasing his divine sense to sweep over Yang Kai.

The next moment his tiger-like eyes rounded, as if he'd seen a ghost.

Li Wan and Fei Jian, seeing his expression, hurriedly examined Yang Kai as well and froze on the spot.

Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

This junior nephew, who came from a remote backwater, now stood within the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm; the fluctuations of his True Yuan made it plain.

"I remember when he left the sect for Fuyun City he was at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. After refining the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's medicinal liquid he advanced to the Transcendent Realm, and now—only five or six years later—he's reached this level. Cang Yan, check him; does anything about his cultivation seem off?" Fei Yu asked gravely.

Cang Yan's face turned serious as he examined him closely.

After a moment he shook his head, "Strange—very strange!"

"Strange how?" Li Wan and Fei Jian asked anxiously.

"His cultivation is sound, his foundation solid, and his True Yuan sufficiently pure. At present he is almost indistinguishable from how we were at that stage."

"No way—how did he cultivate to this?" Li Wan exclaimed. Before we went to Fuyun City we were at this level, and now Yang Kai has caught up to where we were.

"If it's not due to fortuitous encounters, then our junior nephew must be a natural prodigy!" Cang Yan's eyes flashed as he grinned, "Junior nephew, what have you experienced these years?"

"Not much—just wandered about. There were indeed some adventures." Yang Kai gave an awkward chuckle.

"Tell us about them." Their interest was instant.

Yang Kai inhaled and, with helpless brevity, recounted his experiences over the years: he glossed over the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, instead focusing on the Ice Sect, his encounter with the Yang Clan in the Small Xuan Realm, and his trials within the Demon Domain. The four senior uncles' hearts rose and fell with every tale.

When he finished, the four fell silent for a long time.

Li Wan sniffed, "You've had quite the life. The Demon Domain... even we don't dare go—rumor says it's teeming with experts and is incredibly perilous."

"So the two senior sisters you sought have been located?" Fei Yu's eyes brightened; she seemed very interested in Su Yan and Xia Ningshang.

"Yes. One has been found—she remains with the Ice Sect. The other and her master are of uncertain whereabouts, but I don't think it'll be long before I meet her again." Yang Kai nodded.

"When that happens, be sure to bring them to the sect. I'd like to see what kind of people your two senior sisters are who have left such an impression on you."

"There will be the chance."

"Enough talk. The junior nephew's return to the sect today is a joyous occasion—let's celebrate properly!" Cang Yan proposed loudly, shooting a glance at Li Wan and Fei Jian, who promptly exchanged eager looks.

Li Wan and Fei Jian caught his meaning and immediately agreed.

Fei Yu scolded with a laugh, "You rotten men only come for my Thousand Red Flower Wine; any excuse and you run off to Qixiu Peak. I'll tell you—this is the last time. For the junior nephew's sake I'll treat you once more, but next time I swear I'll take you on!"

The men gave sheepish laughs and hurried to make preparations.

After much drinking, Cang Yan and the others grew thoroughly drunk and supported one another as they left Qixiu Peak. Before they departed they reminded Yang Kai to pay a visit to the Sect Patriarch when he had time—he was quite worried about him.

Yang Kai readily agreed.

Fei Yu's cheeks flushed from the wine; her eyes misted and she flopped onto the stone table clutching a wine jar, falling asleep in a most undignified fashion.

Yang Kai could only shake his head and tidy up the aftermath.

The next day Yang Kai went to meet Chu Lingxiao.

Inside the secluded chamber where he secluded himself to cultivate, Chu Lingxiao sat on a meditation cushion as if he had not stirred in all these years.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Chu Lingxiao was very pleased. After a few words, he suddenly said, "Cang Yan and the others told me you've reached the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm. I had my doubts, but it seems to be true."

"Some fortunate encounters—otherwise I wouldn't have attained this."

"You needn't be so modest. Opportunities and chance encounters are sometimes part of one's strength; if you've met them, then they belong to you," Chu Lingxiao nodded slightly, his eyes bright as he stared at Yang Kai. "Yet your aura is peculiar... not the same calm as before. There's an air of majesty about you now. I'm quite curious—you are young and have never experienced the realm of those above you; where does this majesty come from?"

Yang Kai was surprised that Chu Lingxiao could perceive even that.

That majesty belonged to the Dragon Emperor, not to Yang Kai himself.

Before Yang Kai could answer, Chu Lingxiao waved his hand, "I only said it in passing—you needn't explain. Everyone has secrets they don't want others to know."

Yang Kai gave an awkward laugh, then said earnestly, "Master Patriarch, I have a question to ask."

"Speak freely." Chu Lingxiao nodded kindly.

"Can you construct Void Passages?"

"Oh?" Chu Lingxiao smiled faintly, "How do you know of that?"

Yang Kai scratched his head, "You may have forgotten, Patriarch—you created a Void Passage around Lingxiao Pavilion that connects to thousands of miles away..."

"Now that you mention it, there was indeed such a thing." Chu Lingxiao thought for a moment and nodded. "Yes, I once made a Void Passage there... but it wasn't purely my skill—I borrowed the power of a secret treasure to do it."

"Could you tell me more?" Yang Kai asked solemnly.

He could tear space now, but he couldn't fix his landing point: when he emerged from the chaotic void flows, he could appear anywhere within a few hundred miles.

If he landed in danger, a single misstep could send him into irrevocable doom.

If he could determine direction, the method would be extremely useful.

That was why he asked Chu Lingxiao.

"That secret treasure I acquired by chance. I knew it contained void power but never used it nor comprehended its mysteries. Once, in a battle with a demon general, I inadvertently triggered the entrance to a hidden Void Passage and arrived in your world, where I slew the demon general and established Lingxiao Pavilion—but I could not find my way back!" Chu Lingxiao's expression filled with the memory. "I stayed there many years and finally had to pin my hopes on that secret treasure. Even invoking its might only created a Void Passage that could transmit across thousands of miles; it still couldn't return me."

As he spoke, Chu Lingxiao's face was full of wistful sighs.
