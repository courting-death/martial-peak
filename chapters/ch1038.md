## Chapter 1038 — Battling a Saint King

The shield-type Secret Treasure had saved that Third-Stage Saint Realm cultivator from certain death many times, and he regarded it as his strongest line of defense.

As the shield was conjured and a measure of ease filled his heart, just as he prepared to counterattack a crisp crack rang out; he looked down in disbelief and saw his Secret Treasure shield pierced by that Demonic Flame Spear, a hole torn through it, its spiritual potency greatly diminished, and the light upon the shield instantly dimmed.

He could not help but scream.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Three Heaven-Slaying Spears, head to tail, shot forward without pause; the Secret Treasure shield thundered and shattered, and spear after spear tore through his flesh— the sturdy body of a Third Stage of the Saint Realm practitioner proved as fragile as paper.

The vitality in his eyes rapidly faded; the luster dimmed, and he toppled head over heels toward the ground.

In an instant, of the three people surrounding Yang Kai, one was dead and another gravely wounded!

The corpse, riddled with several bloody holes, was burned to ashes before it hit the ground; even the soul that had fled the body could not escape the demonic flame, its twisted spirit body like snow beneath a scorching sun, vanishing in an instant.

The wounded one wailed miserably on the ground as the demonic flame engulfed him, his cries growing ever feebler until they were no longer audible.

Only a single warrior at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm remained, squinting as he fixed his gaze on Yang Kai, his expression grave to the extreme.

He could not imagine that a youth who had only reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm would carry such weight—effortlessly slaying two warriors one level above him, he had not even drawn a breath, as though crushing two ants.

At this moment, astonishment also flickered across the youth's face; he himself seemed somewhat surprised.

A savage, bloodthirsty aura quietly sprouted within him, instantly elevating his momentum to a new high.

Gazing into his cold eyes, the Saint King Realm warrior could not help but shudder; he had the unmistakable illusion that the adversary before him was not merely a Second Stage Saint but an expert far beyond his level.

Before fighting, he already felt the urge to retreat—he was uncertain he could overcome the other.

"Profound Heaven Sword!" Yang Kai suddenly barked; a demonic-flame long sword condensed in his hand, the blade like a startled swan, black radiance flashing as a tremendous sword-light cleaved down toward the last man.

The opponent finally snapped to his senses, a suppressed roar coming from his throat; a surge of energy burst forth in his Sea of Consciousness. That energy was peculiar, and as it pulsed a gigantic thing suddenly shot out from between his brows.

It was a five or six zhang-long creature encased in a hard shell—a Golden-Armored Venom Scorpion, ferocious enough to be notorious throughout the Star Domain.

The Golden-Armored Venom Scorpion, the moment it appeared, exhaled a thick jade-green miasma that polluted the air for dozens of li; its powerful pincers snapped with a clack that could cut metal and jade, chilling one to the bone.

The sword-flame of the demonic blaze struck the scorpion's shell but could not harm it at all, only leaving a shallow scar; the burning demonic flame was swallowed by the green poison miasma and was extinguished in short order.

Seeing the scorpion able to withstand the blaze, the Saint King Realm warrior laughed out loud and barked, "Kid, you have some nerve. On Shuiyue Star you actually dare kill members of the Commerce Guild—you're done for!"

"You people are from the Hengluo Commerce Guild?" Yang Kai's eyelids narrowed.

"Enough talk—give up your life!" The man would not waste words with Yang Kai; he pointed, and the Golden-Armored Venom Scorpion hurtled at Yang Kai like a bolt, its pincers snapping. From its tail shot jade-green spectral light, carrying power that could poison and extinguish the spirit.

This scorpion was monstrously deadly; its entire body was poisonous—whoever it touched died. What terrified warriors most was that its toxin could wound flesh and also affect the Divine Sense, so areas where such scorpions prowled were treated as forbidden ground, only the very strong would dare target them.

This Saint King Realm warrior had clearly once slain a Golden-Armored Venom Scorpion and refined its soul into a weapon for use against foes.

He released it against Yang Kai without a second thought.

It was the scorpion's spirit body, possessing all the abilities it had in life; though it lacked a flesh shell, that solid soul-force could withstand a great deal of damage.

Yang Kai's Profound Heaven Sword was of no use.

Seeing it pounce like needles and lightning, intent on tearing him open, Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness power erupted; he gathered it and slammed it at the Golden-Armored Venom Scorpion.

Seeing his action, the Saint King Realm warrior was not alarmed but delighted; rather than stopping him he watched with relish.

This young man clearly did not comprehend how terrifying the scorpion was—seeing it as merely a spirit body, he attempted to deal with it using Divine Sense, not realizing the toxin was not something Divine Sense could fend off.

He had already foreseen Yang Kai's fate.

Invisible forces collided; the massive scorpion's charge abruptly halted, its pincers flailed wildly and its sharp tail lashed the air with hissing sounds as jade-green lights blasted from the stinger into Yang Kai's Divine Sense.

Yang Kai's face sank—he had the sensation that even his consciousness was being numbed.

He immediately realized the scorpion was not as simple as he had imagined.

Without hesitation, his Divine Sense Fire fully erupted.

The air instantly grew scorching; the space where the scorpion stood twisted, obscuring sight.

The Saint King Realm expert who had been watching as if enjoying a show was stunned; sensing the strangeness of Yang Kai's Divine Sense power his face changed and he hurried to retrieve the scorpion.

But the next moment the scorpion trembled violently, struggling as if suffering unbearable torment.

Cracks split across its golden shell; the Divine Sense Fire wedged into those seams and ignited it from within.

The Golden-Armored Venom Scorpion was set ablaze—what the Profound Heaven Sword could not damage was consumed and its spirit scattered in an instant.

"Impossible!" the Saint King Realm warrior roared, eyes wide as he stared at the spot where the scorpion had vanished, his face wracked with terror.

Even a Third Stage Saint King sent against this scorpion would not slay it in so short a time; only an Origin Returning Realm expert could accomplish that!

He abruptly turned his gaze to Yang Kai, a layer of crimson covering his eyes; his aura went berserk.

The Golden-Armored Venom Scorpion had been his painstakingly refined trump card—every time he used it it had been unstoppable and had repeatedly bailed him out; merely cultivating its soul had cost him countless exertions.

Years of effort were wiped away in an instant; he was furious to the core and intended to kill the youth who had destroyed his labor to vent his hatred.

"Kid, I'll have your life!" he bellowed. He drove his Divine Sense and one grotesque demonic beast spirit after another manifested, floating around him, their beastly eyes glaring hungrily at Yang Kai.

The Saint King Realm warrior stood amid them like the king among beasts, his fury unbound.

With a flick of his will, the demonic beast spirits all lunged at Yang Kai together; he hid himself within the beast souls, seeking an opening to strike covertly.

Hisssss...

Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire continued to surge; that searing Divine Sense power slammed into the beast souls, forcing them to wail as one by one they were burned away.

The burning beast-spectres obscured sight. The Saint King Realm expert rapidly closed in on Yang Kai; an uncanny, vast power exuded from him and suddenly formed a vortex that dragged at Yang Kai, pulling him downward.

He sneered. Dazzling divine light shot from his palms, and violent energy waves emanated that seemed able to rend space itself, as if gathering homicidal intent to swallow Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s entire body was wreathed in demonic flame, like a blazing fireball. Channeling his strength into the vortex beneath his feet, he struck at its profound intent and domain force, wrenching himself free from its grasp.

The next moment he was enveloped by a host of divine lights.

Yang Kai's face changed as he felt the opponent's might; he finally understood that the Saint King Realm and the Saint Realm were not of the same order—though he could easily kill Third Stage Saint practitioners, he could not quickly slay an enraged Saint King Realm expert; even a First Stage Saint King posed real danger to him.

At that level of cultivation, comprehension of the true meaning of force and its application far exceeded his own.

"Demon God Transformation!" he roared inwardly.

Invisible demonic marks crawled up over him, hidden within his flesh, wildly boosting his qi and blood power and causing his life force to surge...

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Divine light struck his body; Yang Kai was heavily wounded, his torso swaying as he emitted stifled groans.

The Saint King Realm warrior's expression contorted; he sneered and mercilessly lunged at Yang Kai, intent on delivering a final strike.

He suddenly discovered that this strange youth was not as powerful as he had imagined, and his confidence in his own might returned wholly.

Violent force surged from his palms, repeatedly battering Yang Kai's body as he poured his Saint Yuan into him, rampaging inside to undermine his life force.

Then he saw Yang Kai's derisive eyes and unconcerned countenance.

Though the youth appeared grievously wounded, blood at his mouth, he seemed utterly unbothered.

They exchanged fists and grapples, brutal close-quarters combat unleashed.

Blood flew; Yang Kai was cut and torn, and the Saint King Realm warrior fared no better, his body stained with blood and looking wretched.

Fighting above one's rank was not new to Yang Kai, but engaging a Saint King Realm expert in direct combat was his first time.

Under such circumstances his potential seemed ignited—many mysteries of power that normally eluded him were fully comprehended in that moment.

He grew bolder, a touch of madness surfacing in his eyes; his power did not waver but grew ever stronger.

In contrast, after the initial sharpness the Saint King Realm expert's momentum gradually waned.

He felt that if the fight continued he might die!

His body was riddled with wounds, countless meridians ruptured, many bones cracked; that cluster of strange demonic flames had nearly reduced him to a ball of fire, forcing him to circulate power to fend off the burns.

But he could not withstand the profound intent that chilled and burned in turns, and once more he began to harbor thoughts of retreat.
