## Chapter 1738 — You Have No Chance

Yang Kai only glanced once and already saw that things were looking grim for Gu Jianxin.

Earlier, when he and the two women had used this secret technique, the three celestial visions of sun, moon, and stars shone brilliantly — the crescent moon and the myriad stars encircling the blazing sun, complementing one another. But now, those visions of sun, moon, and stars were showing signs of fading, and the trio’s momentum was clearly far weaker than before.

Li Minghai, on the other hand, remained as steady as ever — showing not the slightest hint of decline.

It looked as if, unless something unexpected happened, Gu Jianxin would be defeated in the end.

While their struggle raged, Yang Kai began to shift his position, closing in from that direction.

For Gu Jianxin to have brought things this far was already no small feat; even if he could not grievously wound Li Minghai at the last moment, he would at least be able to cause some hindrance, and at the very least draw Li Minghai’s attention.

As long as Li Minghai’s attention was diverted, Yang Kai could seize the opportunity to strike.

In no time, Yang Kai had crept to somewhere about ten li outside the battle ring! This was already as close as he could get without being noticed; any closer and Li Minghai would certainly sense him.

No sooner had he concealed his form than Li Minghai’s shout carried over: “Young Alliance Master, if that is all you can do, then this old man will send you on your way!”

Gu Jianxin did not speak—whether he had no time to answer or simply would not bother was unknown—and the swordlights the two Sword Servants had linked with him suddenly surged; in an instant they congealed into a sword radiance a hundred zhang long and viciously slashed down at Li Minghai.

Li Minghai laughed heartily. “Trifling tricks! At this point, Young Alliance Master, will you still stubbornly resist?”

As he spoke, the Soul‑Breaking Spear in his hand trembled. From its tip shot forth a pitch‑black profound light that met the immense sword radiance.

The black and white lights clashed in midair, sending rings of ripples spreading outward in all directions. Within those ripples was contained a terrifying force that even Origin Returning Realm masters would have to avoid — a clear testament to the ferocity of this exchange.

The two utterly distinct rays locked in a stalemate in the void, but very soon that situation was broken.

No one knew what secret technique Li Minghai had used, but the jet-black light suddenly swelled in size, instantly overpowering and forcing the sword light back.

There was a tremendous boom.

The sword radiance shattered. With muffled groans, three figures were flung screaming in different directions.

Gu Jianxin’s face was pale, a trace of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth—he had clearly suffered injuries.

His two Sword Servants were even worse off. Having trained alongside Gu Jianxin since childhood as his attendants, they existed for his sake; their cultivations had always lagged a step behind Gu Jianxin’s.

Having borne the brunt of more damage just now, both Servants’ delicate bodies trembled and staggered, blood pouring from their mouths and noses, staining their garments red.

A flash of murderous light flickered in Li Minghai’s eyes, yet he did not seize the moment to finish Gu Jianxin; instead his figure flashed, he shook his spear and charged toward the nearest Left Sword Servant.

As a Void King‑Realm expert, his combat experience was naturally vast. Although this was the best moment to kill Gu Jianxin, Gu Jianxin’s identity was exceptional—he even bore a Bright Sea Dividing Domain Mirror—so one could not rule out that he had other more powerful secret treasures.

Li Minghai lacked the confidence to kill him with a single strike.

So he chose the Left Sword Servant as his target; without that Servant’s assistance, Gu Jianxin could not perform the Sun–Moon–Star Three‑Swords Shining Secret Technique, and then Li Minghai could grind him down alone.

Seeing Li Minghai’s movements, a trace of resolve and unease flashed across the Right Sword Servant’s beautiful eyes. She hastily steadied her retreating figure, urged her Saint Yuan, and, wrapped in sword light, poured all her strength into rushing toward the Right Sword Servant’s side.

Gu Jianxin howled hoarsely like a wounded beast, “Lingyue, hide!”

At the shout, he, like the Right Servant, desperately rushed that way.

Three lights chased the Left Servant together, the distance rapidly narrowing.

A mocking smile tugged at Li Minghai’s mouth as he sensed the moment was right; he suddenly executed a feint and hurled the Soul‑Breaking Spear viciously, aiming it at the Right Sword Servant.

Everyone was stunned for a beat.

Only then did they understand that Li Minghai’s initial target had not been the Left Servant at all, but the Right Servant!

Or perhaps he had adapted and chosen a better target on the fly…

Once the Soul‑Breaking Spear left Li Minghai’s control it writhed, turning into a gigantic python that opened a blood‑red maw, its violent aura surging skyward; in an instant it descended before the Right Servant and seemed ready to swallow her whole.

This was truly a Void‑King‑grade secret treasure; a single Right Servant could not possibly withstand it—struck head‑on, there would only be death.

At that moment, somewhere on Gu Jianxin’s body flashed a light. Whether by secret art or secret treasure, he had somehow mysteriously appeared before the Right Servant, thrown one arm around her, shielding her at his side and back; a blue protective armor of scales manifested around his body.

Radiance flowed across that armor, clearly an excellent defensive secret treasure; driven by Gu Jianxin’s Saint Yuan, an energetic membrane bloomed over the armor, appearing extremely solid.

No sooner had he finished than Li Minghai’s attack arrived.

The python writhed and slammed into Gu Jianxin’s armor.

The bright energy membrane visibly dulled at an astonishing rate; within less than three breaths it shattered with a roar. The aftershock struck Gu Jianxin, battering him until he bled copiously and flew backward on his back, and the Right Servant he had sheltered also spat a mouthful of blood, her face deathly pale.

“The Young Alliance Master truly values loyalty and righteousness—this old man admires that, but… you can save one; can you save a second?” Li Minghai’s triumphant voice rang out with scorn and derision.

As Gu Jianxin flew backward he focused and found, to his shock, that Li Minghai had once again, at some unknown moment, closed to the Left Servant and was raising a hand to strike her.

On that palm, Saint Yuan surged, forming a vortex visible to the naked eye!

The vortex force, coupled with the pressure of a Void King‑Realm expert, suppressed the Left Servant so she could not move or resist.

But as death descended, she did not fret for her own safety; instead she looked anxiously toward Gu Jianxin and, seeing he was not dead but gravely wounded, revealed a faint smile of relief and then mouthed a slight movement of her lips.

Her voice could not be heard, but Gu Jianxin understood—she was telling him to flee!

“Li Minghai!” Gu Jianxin roared like an injured beast, his eyes instantly turning blood‑red.

“Young Master, run!” The Right Sword Servant clutched Gu Jianxin’s arm and shouted in a voice choked with sobs into his ear, “Sister Lingyue wouldn’t want you to throw your life away; if you go, Lingyue Sister’s death will be meaningful!”

Gu Jianxin stood unmoved, but a look of stupefied astonishment twisted his already ferocious features and was immediately replaced by a burst of joy as his gaze turned toward Li Minghai’s back.

He discovered that, at some unknown moment, a figure had appeared behind Li Minghai, like a specter, closing to within less than three chi of him, and the old dog Li had not noticed.

The figure stretched a hand forward, and one by one pitch‑black, crescent‑shaped attacks suddenly formed and surged like a storm toward Li Minghai.

Those attacks carried extremely abstruse and obscure fluctuations of power; even from a great distance Gu Jianxin could sense them.

When the assault struck, Li Minghai finally noticed. He roared “Who goes there?” and hastily spun to slap out at the assailant.

What both shocked and excited Gu Jianxin was that Li Minghai’s palm failed to disperse all of those crescent attacks; some of them still struck his arm.

Li Minghai’s arm began to strangely and bit by bit vanish!

As if it had never existed, as if swallowed by the void…

Pain surged; Li Minghai howled in furious madness. With his other intact hand he recalled the Soul‑Breaking Spear, and his eyes blazed as he glared at the young man who had ambushed him, snarling, “Brat, I will make you pay!”

“You won’t have that chance!” the youth snorted. With a flick of his wrist a smooth, blade‑less, jade‑green long sword appeared. The sword shivered and warped, then manifested as a jade‑green giant dragon that lunged at Li Minghai.

The dragon’s roar shook the heavens and its might spread. Li Minghai howled and hurriedly invoked the Soul‑Breaking Spear’s power, forming the python once more to meet it.

The two treasure‑beasts formed from secret treasures clashed in the void, but how could the python withstand the dragon? It only held for a single breath before the dragon crushed it utterly!

A look of terror finally bled into Li Minghai’s eyes. He sought the youth who had ambushed him but was horrified to find he could not locate him—just as the youth had appeared like a specter, after summoning the treasure he had vanished like one.

A sliver of killing intent struck from behind. Li Minghai’s heart jolted and he hastily unleashed his Domain Field to try to salvage the situation.

Although his clash with the youth had lasted only a moment, he sharply perceived that the youth was only Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; against an Origin Returning Realm expert, a Domain Field was unquestionably the best reliance!

Not everyone, however, was like Gu Jianxin, who possessed a Bright Sea Dividing Domain Mirror that countered Domain Fields.

Li Minghai’s scheme seemed sound, but to his astonishment, as his Domain Field spread another Shi field began to form that not only was not suppressed by his Domain Field but could contend with it on equal footing.

That Shi field contained a subtle and profound force.

The surrounding space began to collapse and fracture; threads of spatial rifts bloomed around Li Minghai, sealing him in tightly!

“Spatial Force!” Li Minghai cried out in alarm.

At that moment the jade‑green giant dragon that had destroyed the python careened in front of him, gaping and snapping its bloody maw toward Li Minghai.

Behind him, a chilling cold pressed in, waves of killing intent encircling Li Minghai.

He was utterly surrounded and trapped with no escape!
