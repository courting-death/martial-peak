## Chapter 1912 — Great Dao Pill Tone

“You are twisting words!” Zhan Yuan shouted angrily, “How can a Minor Recovery Pill be put on the same footing as a Taichu Soul-Returning Pill!”

“Exactly — one is a Saint-Grade Pill, the other a Void King-Grade Pill; the two are not to be mentioned in the same breath.” an alchemist remarked.

"As you said, Master Zuo De is of the Origin Returning Realm; I stand in the Void King Realm — we are not to be mentioned in the same breath," Yang Kai replied with a faint smile.

“Sharp-tongued!” some alchemists shook their heads and sighed, as if it were shameful to argue with Yang Kai. Alchemists lived by skill, not by words.

Zuo De smiled slightly: “Words mean nothing; seeing is believing. No matter how much you say, it’s useless. If you want to convince others, then display all your methods. I trust once everyone has watched, they will judge for themselves.”

“You want to watch?” Yang Kai tilted his head, a mischievous grin on his face.

“You’re feeling guilty, aren’t you!” Zhan Yuan sneered.

Yang Kai ignored him and said to Chairman Ai Ou, “Chairman, you remembered those who just said they would leave the Hengluo Commerce Guild, right? When they go, give them generous severance so people won’t later accuse the Hengluo Commerce Guild of being petty!”

Ai Ou’s face went as black as the bottom of a pot; he had no reply.

Yang Kai laughed loudly, straightened up and called out, “Since you all question my alchemical skill, then let me show you what real alchemy is!”

As he spoke his expression suddenly turned grave; his hands formed a subtle seal and he pointed forward. In midair a wondrous spiritual array diagram appeared and shot into the Purple Void Cauldron, vanishing inside.

In the next moment another spiritual array diagram appeared and again shot into the Purple Void Cauldron.

A third, a fourth...

With each change of Yang Kai’s movements, more and more spiritual array diagrams appeared in midair like winged butterflies, fluttering and dancing as they rushed into the furnace one after another.

“This is...”

“The Pill-Gathering Technique!”

“No way? I didn’t see any alchemical movement from him earlier — how could he be using the Pill-Gathering Technique? Has he already succeeded in refining?”

“Impossible! Even if his furnace was perfectly sealed, some medicinal aroma should have drifted out. No scent means the medicinal liquid hasn’t fused and reacted. How could he be gathering the pill?”

“Yet this is clearly the Pill-Gathering Technique.”

“Have you ever seen this method before?”

Everyone watched dazzled. At first they debated the origin of this Pill-Gathering Technique, but ultimately reached one conclusion: no one had ever seen these methods. They were wholly different from the formulas circulating throughout the Star Domain.

Even compared with Zuo De’s self-created Red Lotus Miraculous-Hand Technique!

The alchemists present were discerning; they immediately recognized this set of methods as staggeringly profound. Seals and spiritual arrays flew forth, and an ancient, desolate aura spread. This technique did not belong to the present age but seemed to hail from antiquity.

All the alchemists wore thoughtful expressions, staring blankly ahead; no one spoke.

Even Zhan Yuan, long opposed to Yang Kai, watched as if entranced; after a while of observation he actually gained an insight.

He couldn’t help but be startled; after all, when he had previously watched Zuo De perform the Red Lotus Miraculous-Hand Technique up close, there had been no such effect. When he recovered, a trace of humiliation showed on his face.

That he, because of this irritating fellow’s methods, had reached an understanding — saying that out loud would be humiliating.

Thinking this, he nevertheless could not tear his eyes away, afraid of missing any of Yang Kai’s movements or any spiritual array diagram; his emotions were in turmoil.

But there were simply too many spiritual array diagrams; one shot after another. In the end Yang Kai’s hands moved like butterflies between flowers, leaving only afterimages; nothing could be seen clearly, and the flying spiritual arrays followed in endless succession, filling the void.

Zong Ao was stunned, Zuo De was stunned, and the many alchemists were thoroughly shocked!

Even the lay observers Xue Yue and Ai Ou watched dazzled, unwilling to close their eyes.

Yet strangely, still no medicinal fragrance appeared.

On the wide open ground Yang Kai’s expression was solemn; though he looked calm, he had in truth used all his skill.

Everything he had comprehended from True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy was being poured out in that moment.

Before his eyes there remained only the furnace and everything within; his sight and thought knew nothing else.

A strange humming sounded from the Purple Void Cauldron, and at the same time the cauldron’s purple light flared wildly.

The sound was not loud, yet like a great bell it poured into the ears of the many alchemists, jolting their minds; faint whispers seemed to echo at their ears, telling of alchemy’s mysteries and the ultimate truths of refinement. But when they strained to listen they could hear nothing; only one or two people changed expression, frowned, and sat cross-legged on the spot.

Every alchemist was shaken.

“This is...”

“The Great Dao Pill Tone!”

“This is actually the legendary Great Dao Pill Tone!”

Those who had not glimpsed the Great Dao Pill Tone looked with envy and jealousy at the peers who had sat cross-legged, for from that sound they had perceived a thread of the Dao of Alchemy.

“Hum...”

Another sound.

The already stunned alchemists showed ever more complex expressions, and after that note of the Great Dao Pill Tone a few more alchemists sat cross-legged and closed their eyes.

The ninth level of the Medicine Master Hall completely erupted; every alchemist’s blood pumped, faces were elated, and eyes glowed with longing as they fixed on Yang Kai’s movements.

They hoped for more Great Dao Pill Tones, hoping that like the few before them they might glimpse the secrets of alchemy.

No one wanted to miss this heaven-sent opportunity.

Zuo De was utterly dumbfounded.

When that strange sound echoed, he still harbored doubt. But when he saw alchemist after alchemist sit cross-legged, he confirmed: this really was the Great Dao Pill Tone!

That sound of the Dao of Alchemy that every alchemist dreamed of and yearned for.

How could this be? How could such a thing happen? He had long been a Void King-Grade alchemist, devoting his life to alchemy.

Yet to date even Pills bearing Pill Patterns had been extremely rare, let alone summoning the fabled Great Dao Pill Tone.

Yet this young man, not old but of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, had, in the most careless and languid refining, caused such an anomaly.

The successive sounds struck Zuo De’s ears as unbearable; his face twisted, as if he wished to drive the sound from his head.

“Father, what is happening?” Xue Yue looked ahead in a daze, bewildered.

She had heard the Great Dao Pill Tone too; it felt peculiar, as if a voice were whispering at her ear. When she tried to listen, she could not catch anything.

But watching the fanatical expressions of the alchemists and hearing their exclamations, Xue Yue understood that something extraordinary had occurred.

“The Great Dao Pill Tone!” Ai Ou’s face was equally stunned, “It truly is the Great Dao Pill Tone.”

“What is the Great Dao Pill Tone?” Xue Yue asked.

“A kind of sound of the Heavenly Dao!” Ai Ou drew a deep breath, trying to steady himself as he explained quietly: “The Martial Dao, the Dao of Alchemy, the Dao of Artifice, the Dao of Arrays... all are branches of the Heavenly Dao. Warriors enter the Dao through martial means; likewise alchemists may enter by alchemy, artificers by artifacts, and so on. Everyone pursues the supreme Heavenly Dao by different paths. The Great Dao Pill Tone is a sound of the Heavenly Dao. Rumor says that if an alchemist’s timing and comprehension are sufficient while refining, such a heavenly phenomenon may be triggered. The sound is useless to ordinary people, but if someone can hear and grasp something, they will benefit for life.”

As Ai Ou spoke he glanced at Zong Ao sitting beside him.

Zong Ao had been the first to sit cross-legged, which meant that among those present, aside from Yang Kai, his comprehension of the Dao of Alchemy was the highest.

“To trigger the Great Dao Pill Tone is a once-in-ten-thousand-years matter; it has nothing to do with rank — fate decides. The tone contains the mysteries of alchemy, the Dao’s pinnacle; it is a secret birthed by heaven and earth themselves!”

Xue Yue’s expression changed; she immediately grasped how significant this Great Dao Pill Tone was as an opportunity for alchemists.

Ai Ou suddenly grinned broadly: “Heaven bless my Hengluo Commerce Guild — after today I wonder how many more alchemy apprentices Shuitian City will produce!”

“Father, you mean...” Xue Yue pondered.

“Don’t you understand? This Great Dao Pill Tone doesn’t only affect the alchemists here; it can enlighten those with alchemical aptitude. If the sound drifts through Shuitian City, we could directly gain tens of thousands of alchemy disciples, and their future achievements would be boundless — it could produce several or even a dozen Void King-Grade alchemists!”

Xue Yue heard this and rejoiced.

At present the entire Star Domain had only a mere three or four Void King-Grade alchemists; Hengluo Commerce Guild could barely claim Zuo De alone, and he was only a Guest Elder.

If one day the Hengluo Commerce Guild truly produced several or even a dozen Void King-Grade alchemists, the guild would inevitably swell in power. No one dared underestimate the might of Void King-Grade alchemists or their methods.

“Xue Yue, go out at once and issue orders; have everyone in the Hengluo Commerce Guild search Shuitian City for those with alchemical aptitude. Offer lavish terms to recruit them, especially children under ten — by any means make them ours!” Ai Ou suddenly commanded in a deep voice.

“But here...” Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai, reluctant to go.

“With your father here to oversee, you need not worry,” Ai Ou waved his hand.

“Yes!” Xue Yue hurried off to carry out Ai Ou’s orders.

After Xue Yue left, Ai Ou muttered with dissatisfaction, “Ah, why isn’t it the Martial Dao Tone!”

If it had been the Martial Dao Tone, he would have a chance to breakthrough to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

He felt some regret.
