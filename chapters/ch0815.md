## Chapter 815 — Nothing You Say Will Help

Outside the Nine Peaks’ barrier, the place was packed and buzzing with noise.

No fewer than several thousand people had gathered here; it seemed those three forces had roped in quite a few helpers of late.

Yang Kai watched calmly and extended his Divine Sense. He soon discovered that among these thousands there were three largest contingents; understanding dawned—those were Poxuan Palace, War Soul Hall, and the Netherworld Sect along with the relatives and allies they had pulled in.

Beyond those three main groups, plenty of miscellaneous factions clustered here and there, each staking out a spot and staring coldly toward the Nine Peaks.

When Xu Hui and the others appeared, the cultivators attacking the barrier hurriedly backed off, and the rest showed looks full of apprehension.

Though the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had declined, it was still a great force that had endured for countless years. In both history and heritage it surpassed any faction present.

Its deterrent power still remained.

All the more because they knew that if they failed to annihilate the Sacred Land this time, once it rose again, none of the factions present would escape retribution.

Every Saint Lord of the Sacred Land could reach the pinnacle of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—almost legendary. Across the continent, aside from a very few, no faction dared guarantee its disciples could attain such a realm.

Faced with such a power, some fear was only natural.

Under Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, the number of Saint Realm experts stood out clearly.

At least fifteen!

Two were at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; the rest were all First Stage.

In both numbers and cultivation, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was at an absolute disadvantage.

“Xu Hui, I’ve known you for nearly a hundred years, and only today do I learn you’re a turtle by nature. What, you think hiding inside your Nine Peaks’ barrier keeps you safe? You think you can wash your hands of the blood-debt your previous Saintess incurred?” The leader of one of the three large contingents—a wizened elder—barked.

His words set off a chorus of raucous laughter; voices jeered and cursed from all sides.

Xu Hui’s expression was cool. “Zhang Ao, must you go this far?” he said coldly.

Hearing him address the man, Yang Kai’s eyes flickered and he gave the old fellow a few more looks.

Zhang Ao—an expert of Poxuan Palace, at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm. Xu Hui had said a dozen days ago that among the three forces, only Zhang Ao warranted concern. He shared Xu Hui’s realm; if they fought, the outcome would be in doubt.

“So what if I do?” Zhang Ao snorted. “I’ve brought friends to your Nine Heavens Sacred Land to demand justice for their slain kin!”

“Justice?” Xu Hui’s keen eyes brimmed with disdain. “A despicable cur like you dares to speak of justice?”

“Whether I’m despicable is not for you to judge,” Zhang Ao sneered. “Your previous Saintess slaughtered lives by the countless while you all hid here and looked away. Where is justice for the dead? Did they provoke your Sacred Land? What did they ever do to you? Many of them didn’t even know you existed!”

“That’s right! You indulged your previous Saintess as she poisoned the common folk—give an account!”

“If you don’t hand over the previous Saintess to be executed, we’ll wipe out your Nine Heavens Sacred Land today!”

“I say they’re all of one stripe—perhaps that previous Saintess was acting on their orders!”

“…”

The crowd’s outrage mounted. Their words were ugly, but most of them held some truth; though Xu Hui and the others fumed to hear it, they had no way to refute.

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to deal with Saintess Nan; they simply lacked the strength.

The Old Saint Lord had died; the last remaining Saintess and the future new Saint Lord had been brought back from the Demon Domain by them. How could they spare the time or energy to handle Saintess Nan? What’s more, she had mastered the Nine Heavens Divine Technique—Xu Hui and the others were no match. Seeking her out would only court humiliation.

The last time Saintess Nan attacked, they had expended great effort just to force her to retreat; countless foundations within the Sacred Land were destroyed, and disciples died or were wounded in droves.

Seeing their expressions, Zhang Ao grew even more overbearing, demanding again and again that they hand over Saintess Nan, to execute her publicly before all to console the spirits of the innocent dead.

Xu Hui and the others were at a loss for words.

The truth—that the Saintess killed no one in life but slew millions in death—was a secret the Sacred Land had concealed. Even if they explained now, no one would believe it.

“Zhang Ao, must you really be so vicious? While the Old Saint Lord lived, he treated your Poxuan Palace well!” Xu Hui roared, then turned aside. “Cao Guan, Wu Jie, do you two intend the same?”

Of the two he named, Cao Guan was the Hall Master of War Soul Hall, and Wu Jie was the Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect—both at the First Stage of the Saint Realm.

Cao Guan chuckled. “Elder, I’ve always recognized only one thing—reason. Whichever side has it, that’s the side I stand with.”

Wu Jie was a thin man with a sinister face and deathly pale skin. He had cultivated an evil art; greenish miasma seeped from the black robe wrapped around him, leaving no one within dozens of Zhang of where he stood. He cackled, “My Netherworld Sect takes money to dispel misfortune. If you can name the price, Elder, it’s not impossible for me to help you right now.”

“Wu Jie!” Zhang Ao shot him a chilly look. “Enough joking.”

Wu Jie gave a queer laugh, shrugged, and said no more.

Zhang Ao sneered again and again. “Xu Hui, you say the Old Saint Lord treated us well. Then answer me this—every year our three forces paid tribute of cultivation resources to your Sacred Land, yet seven years ago when I wished to enter your Nine Peaks’ Four Symbols Cave to cultivate, I was refused. Is this what you call kindness?”

Xu Hui slowly shook his head. “You did pay tribute, true—but have you considered that without the Old Saint Lord’s protection, the Great Yao Lord of the Beast Sea Great Forest would have wiped you out long ago?”

“Don’t bring up that Great Yao Lord,” Zhang Ao snarled, face turning feral. “Don’t think I don’t know—your Old Saint Lord was on friendly terms with that yao, visiting the Beast Sea Great Forest again and again! Humans and yao cannot coexist—dare you betray the people like this? Aren’t you afraid of retribution? Every year disciples from our three sects vanish for no reason—weren’t they seized by those yao?”

An uproar followed. Many of the experts who had been swayed to come wore stunned expressions, as if hearing something unbelievable.

All of them turned to Zhang Ao to question him.

Zhang Ao laughed loudly. “That’s right—the Old Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land did befriend the Great Yao Lord. I personally saw him enter and leave the Beast Sea Great Forest several times. I even captured a demonic beast from there and used a secret method to view its memories—this isn’t me slinging mud at them!”

With that answer, those who had still wavered firmed up at once.

Their hostility toward other races made them conclude the Sacred Land truly wasn’t any good. And since Xu Hui hadn’t refuted such a grave accusation, it clearly must be true.

In an instant, all sorts of hostile gazes roamed over Xu Hui and the rest.

“Xu Hui, why didn’t you invite that Great Yao Lord to help your Nine Heavens Sacred Land?” Zhang Ao asked with smug mockery. “He’s a Third Stage Saint—if he acted, we would have no choice but to retreat. Wasn’t your Old Saint Lord his good friend? Or perhaps even the yao understand that when a person dies the lamp goes out?”

Xu Hui’s face alternated between green and white—he was thoroughly incensed yet unable to argue, and his Qi and blood churned.

“Talking to them is pointless,” Yang Kai said suddenly, his voice low. “Don’t waste breath. The more you argue, the more difficult the Sacred Land’s position becomes. After all, in the matter of Saintess Nan, the Sacred Land does bear responsibility.”

“Mm.” Xu Hui nodded gloomily.

Under everyone’s gaze, Yang Kai strode forward a few steps to stand before Xu Hui and the others.

Thousands of eyes fixed on him at once, faces puzzled. They didn’t know why this young man would step out at such a moment.

Truth be told, when the Sacred Land’s people first appeared, many had already been sizing Yang Kai up in suspicion.

Xu Hui and the others were obviously masters of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—it was only natural for them to be here at such a time. An Ling’er was the Sacred Land’s Saintess—many had heard of her. Only Yang Kai’s origins and identity they couldn’t guess.

So young, yet standing shoulder to shoulder with Xu Hui and the rest—and by the look of it, Xu Hui treated him with notable respect.

Even Zhang Ao was confused. He searched his memory but couldn’t recall such a young man ever emerging from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

“Everyone,” Yang Kai called in a ringing voice, “Saintess Nan is indeed the Sacred Land’s responsibility. But the Sacred Land is powerless for now. Saintess Nan actually died long ago—what remains is a walking corpse. The Sacred Land cannot command her. She bears murderous intent toward us as well; many of you know she attacked the Sacred Land days ago. In our hatred of her, we stand with you—nothing would please us more than to see her destroyed. So I ask that you give the Sacred Land some time. The Great Elder and the others will give you a satisfactory account and eliminate this scourge.”

When he finished, the experts who had been swayed here began to frown one after another.

They weren’t fools; they had their own judgment. Thinking back, they realized they had sensed no spark of life in Saintess Nan—only a faint aura of death.
