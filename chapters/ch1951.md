## Chapter 1951 — Assault

This discovery sent a chill through Yang Kai's heart.

For this was the Ice Cliff's truly dangerous spot.

That omnipresent icy profound intent could corrode a martial artist's thinking, causing one to lose life without noticing, which explained why those dead warriors maintained serene expressions with no sign of struggle or pain.

After checking the grotto, Yang Kai pondered for a moment and then leapt straight down beneath the Ice Cliff.

Although Kou Wu had repeatedly warned him not to venture deep into the Ice Cliff, since this place happened to contain Imperial Might, Yang Kai naturally wanted to experience it.

Years ago, when he had comprehended Imperial Might in the Death Domain outside the Dark Star, he had benefited greatly.

He already had his own set of methods to deal with the suppressive effect of Imperial Might.

Still, he did not act recklessly; he controlled his speed and descended slowly, bit by bit.

As Kou Wu had said, the deeper one went the denser the Imperial Might became, and the more terrifying the embedded profound intent.

Having only descended a hundred zhang, Yang Kai was already struggling; even with all his strength unleashed he could not withstand the bone-deep cold, and his Origin Qi circulation became extremely sluggish.

With no other choice, Yang Kai had to activate his Domain Field.

When his Domain Field first took shape back then, it too had been forged under the suppression of the Imperial Might within the Imperial Garden—Might that was in no way weaker than what pressed down upon him here.

Therefore his Domain Field possessed a certain degree of resistance to Imperial Might.

Once the Domain Field appeared, Yang Kai immediately felt much relieved.

Silently releasing his Divine Sense to probe downward to gauge the Ice Cliff's depth, he soon retracted it in alarm.

He had discovered that the icy profound intent and the Power of the Laws were freezing the Divine Sense he had sent out; had he not withdrawn it in time, his Divine Sense would likely have been damaged.

After realizing this, Yang Kai no longer dared to project his Divine Sense.

Below, an inky blackness yawned like a ravenous abyssal beast opening its maw, making one's heart tremble.

Descending another three hundred zhang, a series of cracking sounds rang out from around Yang Kai's body.

It was a sign that the Domain Field was approaching its limit; should he continue downward, the Domain Field would certainly collapse. At that point, with only his own strength he could not withstand the Imperial Might and the profound intent hundreds of zhang below, and death would be the only outcome.

This was his limit! Yang Kai understood in his heart and did not force the issue; instead he rose and shot upward.

Although this inspection yielded nothing, Yang Kai knew this was indeed a fine place to temper one's will. In a certain sense he even had to thank Bian Yuqing.

He did not fly to the very top of the Ice Cliff, but chose instead to carve out a grotto a hundred zhang from the summit.

This spot matched his current strength best—the Imperial Might and the profound intent here were at a level he could barely contend with, and closing himself off to cultivate here would greatly benefit his growth.

Carving the grotto cost Yang Kai a fair amount of trouble.

The Ice Cliff had long been immersed in that special icy environment; the rock face had been corroded by Imperial Might and the Power of the Laws, no longer ordinary stone but extremely hard ice-rock.

Yang Kai spent three full days before he had carved out a crude grotto.

And that grotto was only the size of two rooms.

He did not rush into seclusion; instead he sat cross-legged in the grotto, resisting the harsh environment while recuperating.

Fortunately, from refining pills for others earlier he had accumulated many Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills and Source Crystals, so his recovery proceeded swiftly.

Yang Kai spent several more days bringing his condition to its best, and only then set about the most important matter.

Breakthrough!

His strength had amassed to the peak of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, and his comprehension of the Martial Dao's heavenly way was nearly sufficient; after arriving in the Star Realm and entering the Biyu Sect he already had the qualification to break through.

Yet he did not rush to do so.

One reason was not wanting to stand out too much—when under others' roof, caution was sensible. Another was to accumulate a bit more so the breakthrough would proceed more smoothly; most importantly, there was no suitable place.

Although he had lodgings in the Biyu Sect and could use his identity token to activate that house's restrictions and keep ordinary martial artists out, it could not prevent Bian Yuqing's Divine Sense from inspecting.

Yang Kai did not wish to expose his secrets.

This place was not the Dark Star—on the Dark Star he was the master and could find uninhabited, undisturbed seclusion at will.

He had intended to stay in the Biyu Sect a while to win Bian Yuqing's trust, then temporarily leave to find a suitable spot for secluding himself to breakthrough.

But this trip to the Ice Cliff gave him different thoughts.

Wasn't the Ice Cliff itself an excellent place to break through?

Here the surrounding ten-thousand-mile area was uninhabited, and Imperial Might and the Power of the Laws permeated the place; even if his breakthrough caused a commotion, it could not spread very far.

In three months, when he returned to the Biyu Sect having advanced to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, he would have a good explanation if Bian Yuqing asked.

He could simply tell her he had insights while secluding himself at the Ice Cliff; she would likely not pry, for the Third Stage of the Void King Realm meant little to her.

For all these reasons, Yang Kai felt his breakthrough was certain to succeed.

Over the years he had considered in detail how to break through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and already had plans.

Inside the grotto he sat cross-legged with Source Crystals he had earned spread around him; roughly counted, there were at least thirty thousand pieces.

Those were all the Source Crystals he presently owned.

Even as a Void King-Grade alchemist, in that past month he had been refining pills nonstop, and Source Crystals were not easy to come by.

Still, thirty thousand pieces of Lower-Level Source Crystal should be sufficient to support this breakthrough.

He did not rush to force an advancement, but in the harsh cold recalled the path his Martial Dao had followed.

Studying under the Lingxiao Pavilion, he had risen from a Trial Disciple step by step, enduring innumerable hardships; the journey had also been accompanied by beauties and was not lonely…

He had not trained long; among Void King Realm martial artists he was young, but his life experiences were rich and colorful, not much inferior to those ancient monsters who had lived for hundreds or thousands of years.

Scene after scene of years past played back in Yang Kai's mind as if it were yesterday, with the brilliant and perilous moments vivid and clear.

Yang Kai's mood was as still as a deep well.

Time passed, and Yang Kai forgot everything.

The icy law circled around his body, invading his flesh and seeping into his organs.

Inside the grotto Yang Kai's hair gradually turned white as if frozen, life signs weakened, and even his breathing and heartbeat slowed.

He seemed to be following the same path as those dozen or so dead Biyu Sect disciples, as if he would come to his end in the cold.

But within his body, earthshaking changes were occurring.

In his lower abdomen, the mingled Origin Qi and Saint Yuan erupted into violent tumult, surging and colliding; his flesh, Qi and blood were thrown into disarray and then condensed at the Dantian in his abdomen, giving rise to a wondrous transformation in that spot.

The greatest difference between a Second Stage and a Third Stage of the Void King Realm was not the conversion ratio of Origin Qi and Saint Yuan; even without Origin Qi a martial artist could ascend to the Third Stage.

The difference lay in the Void Mind Crystal.

Only by refining one's own Void Mind Crystal could one truly become a Third Stage of the Void King Realm martial artist.

The Void Mind Crystal was the martial artist's essence, encompassing all of that individual's comprehension of the Martial and Heavenly Dao.

It was like a demonic beast's Inner Core: a demonic beast could use its Inner Core to power its secret techniques and increase their killing power.

Martial artists at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and above could form one as well. The Void Mind Crystal was the crystallized embodiment of a warrior’s comprehension of the Martial and Heavenly Dao; when unleashed in combat it could amplify a finishing technique to devastating effect.

In desperate moments one could even sacrifice the Void Mind Crystal to perish alongside an enemy, just as a demonic beast might use its Inner Core—there was no difference between the two.

To condense one's own Void Mind Crystal, one must first answer a single question — which branch of power is being meticulously cultivated.

The Void Mind Crystal was not omnipotent; it usually only strengthened one aspect of a martial artist's power. For example, when Yang Kai had first entered the Martial Dao he cultivated yang attribute techniques; later he could enter a Demonic State where his internal power took on a demonic flame quality. Even his secret techniques—Golden Blood Threads and the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi—could be condensed into his Void Mind Crystal.

But once the choice was made, the Void Mind Crystal would only enhance that chosen aspect.

If Yang Kai condensed his insight into the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi into his Void Mind Crystal, then when he later used that Sword Qi its potency would be greatly increased.

The same would be true for the Golden Blood Threads.

Yet Yang Kai did not plan to do that; his Void Mind Crystal would, first and foremost, be Spatial Force.

Spatial Force was cunning and difficult to guard against, superior to almost any other power; since Yang Kai was proficient in Spatial Force, he naturally aimed to refine it—this was a resolve he had never changed.

It was also why he did not casually breakthrough in the Biyu Sect.

Spatial Force was his trump card, and Bian Yuqing still did not know he cultivated it; if it were exposed during a breakthrough, it would immediately draw the attention of the Biyu Sect's higher-ups.

Spatial Force, in the vast expanse of the Star Realm, was a power that only a rare few can truly master.

In his lower abdomen, the mingled Origin Qi and Saint Yuan continued to gather and condense, accompanied by unimaginable pain.

At the same time, within his Sea of Consciousness his understanding of Spatial Force and comprehension were being transformed into formless power, cleansing his Sea of Consciousness.

His soul was unprecedentedly tranquil; he focused all consciousness inward, and within that wondrous profound intent the elusive Spatial Force welled up. Unawares, he earnestly experienced the essence of that power and slowly realized its meanings.

Time slipped by quietly and swiftly.

Gradually, very obvious fluctuations of Spatial Force emanated from his body, shattering the frozen frost layer on his surface.
