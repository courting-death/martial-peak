## Chapter 137 — What Benefit Is There in Not Killing You?

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai's expression changed dramatically. Without a moment's hesitation, he unleashed a punch that struck the withered bone before him, shouting, “Delusional!”

The ancient skeleton, which had died here countless years ago, shattered without any suspense under his blow.

However, Yang Kai's expression did not relax; instead, it grew even more serious.

“Decisive enough, but you’ve chosen the wrong target!” A voice filled with pride echoed, and the bead suddenly emitted a ghostly light. Yang Kai then saw a distorted, ferocious face flying out from the bead, wrapped in a black mist, baring its teeth and lunging at him like a vengeful spirit.

The soul did not hide within the skeleton, but rather within the glowing bead!

Just as Yang Kai was about to strike again, the flying face opened its mouth and let out a piercing shriek. The sound drilled into Yang Kai's ears, causing a sudden, excruciating pain in his mind as if thousands of needles were stabbing him.

With a muffled groan, Yang Kai's movements halted involuntarily. He realized that the voice had spoken the truth; his mind had undoubtedly been tampered with, otherwise, such a sudden change would not have occurred.

Seizing this opportunity, the face laughed maniacally as it burrowed into Yang Kai's body.

With a jolt, Yang Kai's entire being stiffened, unable to even blink, as if he had lost control of his own body.

A voice emanated from within him: “Hahaha, ignorant junior, you dare to resist me! Watch as I erase your consciousness and take over your body!”

Yang Kai's expression flickered with a hint of panic, yet his eyes shone with an unyielding light.

“Your body is too weak and your strength too low; it will suffice for now. Once I am out, I will find a better body. Rest assured, after I take over your body, any deep-seated grudges you have, I will help you resolve them. Just obediently give up resisting, and you will suffer less pain while I save some time.”

“Dream on!” Yang Kai sent a thought back.

“Hehe, at this point, do you still wish to resist? It is your fortune to be chosen by me, junior; do not be ungrateful!” The face indeed heard Yang Kai's thoughts and laughed sinisterly, “Since you are unwilling to cooperate, I will have to use some means. You must endure the pain of having your consciousness erased; it is not something an ordinary person can withstand.”

He kindly reminded Yang Kai, and then, without knowing what method he used, a thunderous sound erupted in Yang Kai's head, the pain far exceeding what he had felt before.

This pain was not like a knife wound; it was a torment that came from the soul. Uncontrollably, a piercing scream erupted from Yang Kai's throat, his clothes instantly drenched in sweat, his body trembling uncontrollably.

“You brought this upon yourself; you cannot blame me,” the face coldly snorted, and even more intense pain followed.

Yang Kai felt as if he were on the verge of collapse, his consciousness in his mind flickering erratically like a candle in a storm, ready to be extinguished at any moment. Yet, within his bloodshot eyes, there remained a stubbornness and persistence.

“Hmm?” The face was taken aback. “How can you still resist? This is truly strange!”

As he spoke, Yang Kai distinctly felt a violent warmth radiating from within his bones. This warmth spread out, stabilizing his erratic soul, and even the immense pain lessened considerably.

At the same time, a powerful suction force surged into his mind.

“What is this?” The voice of the face suddenly turned sharp and panicked, as if it had encountered the most terrifying thing in the world, flustered and helpless. “What is this? No, no, ah!”

Accompanied by its shrill cries, Yang Kai's mind suddenly became clear. He vaguely sensed that something was being drawn into his golden body.

Feeling light all over, Yang Kai gasped for breath.

The events had transpired rapidly; from the moment the face entered his body to now, only about ten breaths had passed. Yet, it felt to Yang Kai as if an eternity had passed.

Moreover, after successfully resisting the face's invasion, Yang Kai clearly sensed that his willpower had grown a bit stronger.

The face's continuous, desperate wails echoed in his mind, but at this moment, it resembled a mouse encountering a cat, its voice sharp and trembling, repeatedly begging for mercy.

After a moment of feeling, Yang Kai discovered that the face was now hiding in a corner of his golden body, its expression one of terror, trembling uncontrollably.

“Hero, hero, I was wrong! Please let me go; I will never dare again!” The terrified voice of the face reached him. It did not know where it was, but it seemed to feel a pair of malicious eyes staring at it, as if it were a delicious meal.

Yang Kai's expression turned strange.

Last time in Jiuyin Valley, his golden body had directly absorbed half of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, which was still stored within him, waiting for him to use it when he broke through to the True Essence Realm.

Today, his golden body had once again absorbed this face.

Although Yang Kai knew that the golden body could absorb any energy except for Yang attributes, he never expected it could even absorb a person's soul.

The soul of a strong person was also a form of energy, and undoubtedly, it was a great supplement! To the golden body, the face was truly just a dish. However, this dish was not yet ready; it needed to be refined by True Yang Primordial Qi before it could be absorbed.

With a thought, ignoring the face's pleas for mercy, Yang Kai silently began to operate the True Yang Technique.

Under the guidance of the True Yang Technique, the face finally managed to escape from the golden body. Before it could feel joy, it found itself plunged into a realm of pure, scorching energy.

Screams immediately erupted: “What are you doing? Stop! No!”

As soon as Yang Kai made a move, the face realized that Yang Kai had some ulterior motive.

“Hero, please don’t do this! If this continues, I will be refined away!”

Yang Kai remained unmoved, repeatedly operating the True Yang Technique. As time passed, the voice grew weaker and weaker until it was barely audible.

Yet throughout, it continued to plead for mercy, not daring to offend in the slightest.

After estimating that it was about time, Yang Kai finally stopped the operation of the True Yang Technique and returned the face to his golden body.

“Thank you... for not killing me, hero.” After a long wait, the voice finally regained some strength, trembling as it expressed its gratitude.

Now, it seemed like a frail girl who had been ravaged by a hundred strong men, utterly weakened.

“What benefit is there in not killing you?” Yang Kai asked indifferently.

The fate of the face rested solely in his thoughts. Realizing this, Yang Kai felt he needed to deliberate carefully.

In truth, Yang Kai did not want to keep it alive. Although their interaction had been brief, he could tell that this person had not been a righteous figure in life. With his current strength still low, keeping it around would be more harmful than beneficial. However, Yang Kai did not know of any means to eliminate it besides refining it.

But once refined, the golden body would absorb it. It would be akin to him consuming a person's soul. Thinking of this made Yang Kai feel somewhat nauseous.

“Benefits? There are benefits, there are!” The face, sensing Yang Kai's intent, hurriedly replied.

“Speak, let me hear!” Yang Kai's demeanor remained calm.

“I wonder... what kind of benefits does the hero want?” The face asked cautiously.

“Hmm?” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

The face trembled slightly and quickly said, “Hero, please don’t misunderstand. I have been dead for many years, and later sealed here. I only awakened a few days ago and do not remember much from before. Please allow me to think; I definitely have benefits to offer you.”

Yang Kai remained silent, knowing that this statement was likely true.

After a moment, the voice suddenly brightened: “Yes, yes! Hero, your strength... cough, cough, is not high, and you should cultivate some defensive martial techniques. I have thought of some powerful martial techniques.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai could not help but become interested, straightening his posture. “What are they? Speak clearly. If I am satisfied, I may spare your life!”

Hearing this, the face visibly relaxed and hurriedly said, “I will definitely satisfy the hero! The martial techniques I have are all at least Mystery-Grade.”

Yang Kai's breath quickened significantly.

Martial techniques are divided into grades: Common-Grade, Earth-Grade, Heaven-Grade, Mystery-Grade, Spirit-Grade, and Saint-Grade, with each grade further divided into upper, middle, and lower tiers. Mystery-Grade martial techniques were exceedingly rare in the entire Han Dynasty.

Not long ago, Yang Kai had fought alongside Lan Chudie and others, and after much effort, each of them had obtained a single set of Earth-Grade martial techniques. Even so, they were all quite satisfied. Mystery-Grade was two tiers above Earth-Grade.

Sensing Yang Kai's eagerness, the face relaxed even more, knowing that only by satisfying Yang Kai could it hope to survive.

Without hesitation, it slowly said, “There is a martial technique called Heart Devouring Seal.”

Yang Kai's brows furrowed involuntarily; the name sounded strange.

“It is relatively simple to cultivate. You take the heart of a child under ten years old, consume three each day, refine their blood within their hearts, and in a hundred days, you can achieve minor success. Once the Heart Devouring Seal is unleashed, the target's heart will explode, killing them in one strike!” The face recounted the cultivation method of this martial technique, its voice filled with self-satisfaction.

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai's expression soured.

“Change it!” Before the face could finish describing the martial technique's power, Yang Kai coldly interrupted.

“Oh, there is another martial technique called Falling Crimson Blossom!” 

Yang Kai slightly nodded; this name sounded more acceptable and had a poetic feel to it.

The face chuckled, “It is even simpler to cultivate, but it must be practiced while engaging with a maiden. You must operate the heart method to refine a drop of her blood, combined with her essence. If the conditions are right, this martial technique can be mastered quickly. Moreover, the higher the woman's strength, the faster the cultivation speed. With about a hundred women, you can achieve great success. I see that you are strong and mighty, seducing ten women is not an issue. This means you can master this Falling Crimson Blossom in just ten days.”

Yang Kai's expression darkened, and he coldly said, “Isn’t this just yin-yang supplementation?”

“Yes, yes, yes! Hero, you see clearly; it is indeed yin-yang supplementation.”

“Change it!”

The face became dejected and reluctantly said, “There is another martial technique called Joyful Fist…”

“Change it!”

“Change again!”

The face's expression turned panicked. If it had a physical form, it would surely be sweating profusely by now. The martial techniques it had mentioned were all unsuitable for Yang Kai's requirements.

They were all extremely evil techniques that required unconventional methods to cultivate, involving heinous acts that defied morality!
