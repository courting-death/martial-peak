## Chapter 2535 — They Must Die

"Sir, you really have nothing more to say?" Yang Kai looked at Elder Fu with a faint smile and asked.

Elder Fu kept a stony face and said nothing. He was an old fox—how could he fall for Yang Kai's tricks? If he spoke again, wouldn't the Young Lady be humiliated once more?

Yang Kai turned his head and looked at the girl in red. "And you? Anything you want to say?"

Tears streamed down the red-clothed girl's face, her cheeks burning as if on fire. How could she dare say anything? She just shook her head like a rattle-drum.

"Since there's nothing to say, then get lost!" Yang Kai's face suddenly darkened as he snorted coldly.

Hearing this, Elder Fu acted as if he had been granted amnesty. He didn't dare utter a word. In a flash, he appeared beside the red-clothed girl, activated his Emperor Yuan to envelop her, grabbed the soft whip that had fallen to the ground, and dashed out like lightning.

When he reached the door, he turned back, his eyes full of venom, glaring coldly at Yang Kai.

He wasn’t as strong as Yang Kai, so he didn’t dare utter any threats. Still, leaving in such disgrace left him bitter and unwilling. All he could do was shoot Yang Kai a meaningful glare—a silent signal full of resentment—before slipping away.

Over there, Zhang Ruoxi didn't try to stop them at all. She simply watched the old and the young leave in silence.

After they disappeared, Zhang Ruoxi walked to the other side of the house, squatted down, and said to the girl called Ling'er, "Little Sister, don't be afraid. The bad people have been driven away."

Ling'er's face was still streaked with tears. Maybe because Zhang Ruoxi had stood up for her and her grandfather earlier, she didn't show the slightest fear now. She just blinked her big eyes, staring curiously at Zhang Ruoxi, as if wondering how this big sister could be even more formidable than her grandpa.

Old Ban also shakily stood up and cupped his fists. "Thank you, Young Master and Young Lady, for your help. This old man is deeply grateful."

If Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi hadn’t suddenly shown up today, Old Ban would have been dragged off by that girl for sure. He didn’t mind entering the Ancient Land—he’d been there so many times that he was confident nothing would threaten his life. But if he left, there’d be no one to look after Ling’er. How could he possibly feel at ease?

"No need to be so polite, Sir. They were the ones who went too far." Zhang Ruoxi smiled gently, not taking credit.

Old Ban sighed. "This matter has troubled you both. May I ask the names of my benefactors?"

He had lived in Desolate City for years and had sharp eyes. He knew the red-clothed girl had a powerful background. For Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi to stand up for him and offend her so thoroughly, he feared the other side wouldn't let it go so easily. He felt quite uneasy about it.

Yang Kai smiled but didn't answer. Instead, he said, "Sir, Ling'er seems quite ill. You should settle her first. Besides, you can't stay here anymore. It's best to leave as soon as possible. We won't disturb you further."

As he spoke, he exchanged a glance with Zhang Ruoxi, and the two of them left together.

Although Yang Kai had come here mainly to invite Old Ban to lead him into the Ancient Land, with this unexpected turn of events, the original plan was no longer feasible.

The old man still had a sick granddaughter to care for. Yang Kai couldn't just make him abandon Ling'er.

Still, even without Old Ban leading the way, Yang Kai was confident he could enter the Ancient Land himself. It would just be a bit more troublesome.

So he simply didn't mention having Old Ban guide them, so as not to make things difficult for him.

"Grandpa..." Suddenly, Ling'er's weak voice called from behind.

Right after, Old Ban suddenly called out loudly, "Please wait, you two!"

Yang Kai turned to look at him.

Old Ban said, "Young master, you want this old man to take you to the Ancient Land, don't you?"

Anyone who came looking for him was here to ask him to lead the way to the Ancient Land. The red-clothed girl was like that, and so were Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi. He had no relatives—no one would visit him otherwise.

There was nothing to hide. Yang Kai nodded. "That's right."

Old Ban said, "Could you two wait for me outside the Ancient Land's passage for a day? After one day, I will definitely come find you and take you in!"

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and smiled. "Sir, I appreciate your kindness, but... you should take care of Ling'er first."

Old Ban patted Ling'er's head. "This is Ling'er's wish. I can't let her down."

Yang Kai frowned. "But if you come with me into the Ancient Land, what about Ling'er?"

Old Ban said, "I've lived here for so many years and have some connections. Ling'er can be placed somewhere safe." He paused, then continued, "I don't have much to my name, and nothing to thank you with. Let this be a small token of my gratitude. I hope you won't refuse."

Since he'd said so much, Yang Kai couldn't refuse. He could only nod. "Alright, then I'll thank you in advance. Ruoxi and I will wait for you at the entrance to the ancient path tomorrow."

"It's settled, then. Safe travels!" Old Ban cupped his hands slightly.

Ling'er suddenly piped up, "Big Brother and Big Sister, be careful! Grandpa says it's very dangerous in there. You must come back alive!"

Zhang Ruoxi smiled at her words. "Alright, Ling'er, you take care of yourself and grow up healthy!"

Ling'er nodded vigorously. Her face, pale from illness, now had a faint flush.

After making arrangements with Old Ban, Yang Kai took Zhang Ruoxi and left Desolate City, heading toward the Ancient Land. After an hour, they found the entrance.

Finding a quiet spot nearby, the two sat cross-legged. Yang Kai took out the jade slip Pi San had given him and carefully studied the map of the Ancient Land.

The Ancient Land was full of dangers, with powerful demonic beasts and natural traps. Even Emperor Realm experts might not make it out unscathed. Although Yang Kai was strong, he wasn't arrogant, so it was necessary to prepare thoroughly.

Besides, he wanted to see if there was any place on the map where Xiaoxiao might be hiding.

If he could find Xiaoxiao on the outskirts, that would be best. If not, Yang Kai would have to venture deeper, where it was even more dangerous.

......

A hundred li outside of the Desolate City, on a barren hillside, the red-clothed girl bit her silver teeth, her face twisted with rage and hatred. She muttered endlessly, her anger almost tangible, as if it would set her whole body ablaze. "Kill them, kill them, kill them all!"

Since childhood, she had never suffered such humiliation, let alone been slapped in public.

Though she had been terrified at the time, unable even to speak, once she was safe, the shame and fury surged up together, making her nearly choke with anger.

How could she not take revenge for this?

Gritting her teeth and cursing, she lashed the two Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artists with her soft whip again and again.

These two, with decent cultivation and from top sects, would be considered top experts outside. Yet, under her whip, they didn't even dare dodge, much less use Origin Qi to defend. They could only grit their teeth and stand there.

Each lash left their skin split and bleeding, their clothes in tatters.

Their eyes blazed with fury, but it wasn't directed at their Young Lady—it was all for Yang Kai.

They thought, if not for Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi, would they be getting punished like this?

It was all Yang Kai's fault.

Elder Fu stood to the side, watching in fear, worried the Young Lady would turn her whip on him. He didn't dare say a word.

He was an Emperor Realm expert—if he were whipped by the Young Lady, he'd have no face left.

Fortunately, she seemed to spare him some dignity. Though nearly losing her mind with rage, she didn't punish him. But each lash on the two Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm guards was heavier than the last, and they could only look to Elder Fu for help.

Elder Fu turned away, pretending not to see, making the two guards curse him in their hearts.

After venting for a long time, the red-clothed girl seemed exhausted. She collapsed to the ground, panting, her sweat-soaked clothes faintly revealing her graceful figure.

But no one dared appreciate the sight. Elder Fu kept his eyes down, and the two guards, half-dead from the beating, stood trembling, as if they might collapse at any moment.

"Elder Fu, send a message back to the Palace. Gather reinforcements immediately!" the red-clothed girl suddenly ordered.

Elder Fu was startled. "Miss, what are you planning?"

The red-clothed girl sneered, gritting her teeth. "What do you think? Of course, I'm going to capture those two dogs, skin them, eat their flesh, drink their blood—I want them dead!"

Elder Fu said, "Absolutely not!"

The red-clothed girl exploded. "Why not? You don't even have the courage to fight them, and you expect me to count on you for revenge!"

Elder Fu's face turned red with shame, but it was true. Under Yang Kai's intimidation, he hadn't even dared to make a move.

Even so, he tried to persuade her. "Miss, before we left, the master told you this trip was for experience, to temper your character. You must not bully others. If the master finds out what really happened, will you ever be allowed out again? Have you forgotten what happened three years ago?"

Hearing Elder Fu mention three years ago, the red-clothed girl shuddered, her face full of fear as she recalled something.

Three years ago, she had gone out to travel, but made a small mistake—bullying a few insignificant martial artists with her status. The next day, her father sent people to bring her back and locked her up for three years.

Three years—three whole years—confined to a room less than twenty zhang across, far from the noise and bustle outside. It was a life worse than death.

She had finally gotten her freedom. If her father caught her again, it wouldn't just be three years this time.
