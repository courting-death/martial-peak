## Chapter 216 — My Name is Jin Hao

Not long after, a rustling sound suddenly came from ahead, as if something was rapidly approaching.

A group of young disciples felt a sense of impending danger, each one alert and tense, while the four experts in the Divine Roaming Realm remained unfazed.

Suddenly, a grotesque head burst forth from the thicket ahead, opening its mouth wide to bite at the old woman leading the group.

The head was as large as a bamboo hat, with two golden, triangular eyes flashing with a fierce and sinister light. It moved at an incredible speed, reaching the old woman in the blink of an eye.

With a light snort, the old woman raised her cane slightly, pointing it forward. It struck the creature's forehead, and with a flick, she jabbed its chin. The enormous head seemed to suffer a tremendous force, being swept aside.

Before it could hit the ground, the head suddenly exploded, a spray of blood mist filling the air.

A middle-aged beauty swiftly darted out, her delicate hand shaking as a colorful ribbon flew from her wrist, like a spirit snake emerging from its hole, capturing a demon core from the blood mist before retracting it.

"Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Python! A peak fifth-grade demon beast!" Ling Taixu whispered to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai focused his gaze and indeed saw the corpse of a headless giant python on the ground, its back adorned with a silver pattern, looking quite eerie. Everything had happened too quickly; he hadn't even had time to get a good look at the giant python before it was dead, and the demon core had already been taken by the middle-aged beauty.

A peak fifth-grade beast equated to the pinnacle of the True Essence Realm. The old woman had killed it with a single strike, showcasing her formidable strength, likely on par with Ling Taixu, if not surpassing him.

After all, Wan Hua Palace was a first-rate sect! Its influence was far greater than that of Lingxiao Pavilion.

"Be careful, these creatures are pack hunters!" Ling Taixu warned again in a serious tone.

Before his words could settle, rustling sounds erupted from all directions, and numerous golden triangular pupils could be seen in the thicket, rapidly approaching.

The old woman did not linger, merely calling out, "Speed up! Once the scent of blood spreads, it will attract more demon beasts."

The group quickened their pace.

Swish, swish, swish... From all sides, countless Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Pythons leaped high, opening their massive jaws to charge at the group.

The old woman wielded her cane, which contained unparalleled lethality; with just a gentle poke, a giant python would immediately perish. Gui Li and the beautiful woman provided support from the center, employing various means to protect their disciples.

Gui Li was indeed a practitioner of dark arts; his techniques exuded a violent and bloody aura. He wielded a spear-shaped artifact, thrusting and striking to kill every approaching enemy. The beautiful woman was slightly less powerful but still handled the fifth-grade demon beasts with ease, her graceful movements leaving a trail of intoxicating fragrance. Often, the Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Pythons charging at her would be struck down before they even got close.

Ling Taixu did not use any artifacts; his moves were simple and unadorned, yet immensely powerful, killing demon beasts at a speed that was not inferior to that of the old woman.

Blood and flesh flew as one Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Python after another fell, the path they traversed resembling autumn leaves swept away by the wind, encountering no resistance whatsoever.

The four young women from Wan Hua Palace also sent forth their ribbons, not to battle the demon beasts but to collect the demon cores from those that had been slain.

The four girls, being fellow disciples, cooperated closely, with three of them working together to blow apart the heads of the fallen demon beasts, while the fourth used her ribbon to gather the demon cores.

The demon cores of fifth-grade beasts were quite valuable.

The girls' actions made the three from Gui Wang Valley envious, but they lacked the means to compete, watching helplessly with envy.

With their spoils in hand, the girls' beautiful faces broke into joyful smiles, each one blooming like a flower, filled with a hint of pride.

Another Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Python charged in, and Gui Li flicked his spear, piercing its vital point and infusing it with fierce True Essence, killing it instantly.

With a flick of the spear tip, the corpse of the Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Python flew towards the crowd. It was clear that Gui Li intended for his disciples to benefit as well.

However, whether intentional or not, he had used too much force, and the python landed right where Yang Kai was standing.

Ling Taixu's eyes flashed coldly but did not intervene.

With a swish, a male disciple from Gui Wang Valley rushed back, a sinister smile on his face. His pale, eerie hand surged with True Essence, slicing into the massive head of the Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Python.

His strike seemed aimed at obtaining the demon core, but in reality, it was delivered with great force, the residual power enough to strike Yang Kai, who stood at the back.

Yang Kai's expression turned cold. In the blink of an eye, he sensed the malice behind the attack and naturally would not sit idly by.

Instead of confronting him directly, he extended his hands, grabbing the already dead Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Python and, with all his strength, hurled it aside.

The Gui Wang Valley disciple, who had been grinning just a moment ago, suddenly changed his expression.

Yang Kai's counterattack caught him off guard, and with a cry, he was thrown back along with the Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Python, flying over ten zhang away.

However, his reaction was swift; while in mid-air, he quickly withdrew his hand from the python's head and pushed off its body with his feet, finally managing to stop his momentum.

Before he could land, two massive pythons that had been lying in wait surged forth, their gaping jaws lunging at him, the rancid smell making him feel dizzy.

His face turned pale, and his hair stood on end.

Despite the four experts in the Divine Roaming Realm slaughtering these giant pythons as easily as if they were chickens, the strength of the True Essence Realm warriors was insufficient against such beasts; they would only meet their demise.

As the crisis approached, the Gui Wang Valley disciple felt the breath of death closing in. He had not anticipated that his ambush on Yang Kai would instead land him in a dire situation, truly a case of harming oneself while trying to harm others.

In this critical moment, Gui Li finally arrived, his spear dancing through the air, sweeping the two giant pythons away. He grabbed the disciple's shoulder and tossed him aside before quickly retreating.

This brief delay nearly allowed the four female disciples of Wan Hua Palace to be attacked by the giant pythons. If it weren't for the middle-aged beauty's quick reaction, rushing over to protect them, those four girls might have been injured.

After Gui Li returned, the middle-aged beauty shot him a fierce glare, angry that he had strayed from the group, putting her disciples in danger.

Gui Li, aware of his fault, did not dare to voice any complaints, merely casting a cold glance at Yang Kai and Ling Taixu.

In the ensuing silent battle, the older generation consciously refrained from intervening, but Yang Kai's clever response had caused the Gui Wang Valley disciple to suffer greatly, secretly harboring resentment and waiting for an opportunity to take revenge.

Yang Kai did not care; the elders had openly declared their intent to kill him, so why should he be polite? Continuing to be courteous would only be seen as weakness.

After charging forward for a while and slaying over twenty Golden-Eyed Silver-Back Pythons, they finally left the perilous area.

This was merely the outermost perimeter of Ghostly Underworld Mountain, yet such dangers were evident, proving that the infamous reputation of the forbidden area was not unfounded.

After the fierce battle, the older generation felt somewhat exhausted. The old woman continued to lead the way in silence, moving about a hundred li before finding a relatively safe place to rest.

The older generation needed to maintain their vitality, while the younger generation needed to recover their strength.

Once they stopped, the old woman from Wan Hua Palace let out a cold hum, glaring at Gui Li. "What happened just now is a one-time occurrence. I do not wish to see a second time. If it happens again, you two may enter on your own. Wan Hua Palace does not wish to act alongside those with ulterior motives, risking our lives."

Gui Li chuckled, "Rest assured, Palace Master Yan. It was merely an accident on my part. My disciple acted a bit too aggressively; it was all a misunderstanding."

"That is best!" The old woman nodded lightly and then sat down to meditate and recover.

The three sects maintained a respectful distance from one another, silent and still.

After a moment, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, just in time to see the Gui Wang Valley disciple who had tried to ambush him walking step by step toward him.

Stopping about ten zhang away, the man coldly stared at Yang Kai and sneered, "My name is Jin Hao. You’d best get far away now, or when we get inside, I will kill you without mercy!"

His arrogant words showed no regard for Ling Taixu, who sat nearby.

Ling Taixu remained silent, merely closing his eyes to meditate.

Yang Kai looked at him and suddenly chuckled, "Brother Jin, the dogs that bite usually don’t bark."

"Ha!" Laughter erupted from the four young women of Wan Hua Palace, unable to hold back their amusement.

The middle-aged beauty shot them a glare, and the girls quickly pursed their lips, pretending to meditate in silence.

Jin Hao coldly retorted, "Sharp-tongued. You’d best pray you don’t run into me inside!"

With that, he turned and left.

Watching his retreating figure, Yang Kai felt an infinite killing intent. The three from Gui Wang Valley were destined to be enemies, but their strength surpassed his, and they had the advantage in numbers. If they encountered each other inside, it would likely lead to a fierce battle.

After resting for a while, the old woman stood up, and Ling Taixu and Gui Li simultaneously opened their eyes.

Still in their previous formation, the group continued deeper into Ghostly Underworld Mountain.

Along the way, they frequently encountered demon beasts. The number of demon beasts in Ghostly Underworld Mountain was vast, with no pattern to their ranks; there were third-grade, fourth-grade, fifth-grade, and even two sixth-grade demon beasts.

However, the two sixth-grade demon beasts clearly recognized that this group was not easy to provoke. They followed for a while before giving up, being much more astute than those who came to seek death.

After slaying these demon beasts, the four young women from Wan Hua Palace reaped the most rewards, their ribbons flying out as they frequently acquired demon cores. The three from Gui Wang Valley also worked together, coordinating with Gui Li to kill beasts and collect cores, obtaining quite a few good items.

Only Yang Kai was relatively poor; after walking this distance, he had only obtained two fifth-grade demon cores, thanks to Ling Taixu deliberately tossing the corpses his way.

Yang Kai did not mind. His strength was the weakest, and the more ordinary he appeared, the less likely he would attract attention. Only by being patient and biding his time could he avoid various dangers and slowly grow stronger.
