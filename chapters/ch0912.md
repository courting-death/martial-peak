## Chapter 912 — You Haven't Seen Her True Face?

A black aperture opened midair, and after a moment Li Rong, accompanied by four yao and Meng Wuya, flew out of it, scoped the direction, and headed downward.

Yang Kai, clutching Xia Ningshang, shot out immediately after them.

The instant their forms left the Void Passage, a flash of light shimmered behind them; the whole passage writhed and warped, then contracted into a tiny black dot and vanished without a trace.

Yang Kai broke into a cold sweat — had they been a moment slower, he and his little senior sister would have been left trapped inside forever.

He looked down: below lay a dense forest, birdsong and floral scents filling the air, verdant hills and fields; the scenery was pleasant.

Li Rong was standing in a patch of open ground below, waving at Yang Kai. “Master, over here!”

“Mm.” Yang Kai replied, and flew down toward her.

At the same time his Divine Sense spread out, alert for any movement.

He had assumed they were still within the Beast Sea Great Forest — after all, that was where they had entered — but after a careful scan he found not a single demonic beast within tens of li.

Puzzled, and having confirmed there was no immediate danger, he withdrew his Divine Sense.

Setting Xia Ningshang aside, Yang Kai hurriedly asked, “How are the others?”

“Not too bad; they weren’t bound for long, so a short rest will do. But this old gentleman…” Li Rong glanced with pity at the gaunt, skin-and-bone Meng Wuya and sighed softly.

Lei Long had said this man had once been the strongest of humanity; now he lay in such a pitiful state. If left untreated, with his current reserves he might not live much longer.

“Don’t worry, I’m here — he won’t die.” Yang Kai said, moving to Meng Wuya and helping him up.

Seeing Shopkeeper Meng in such a miserable condition prickled something in Yang Kai’s chest. In all the time he’d known him, he had never seen him so forlorn.

Meng Wuya painfully stretched out a hand like a dried bone and clutched Yang Kai’s robe with all his remaining strength; his cloudy, lifeless eyes fixed on Yang Kai, and his cracked lips moved.

“Don’t say anything. I know what you mean. I’ll take care of my little senior sister.” Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

Meng Wuya’s eyes brightened for an instant at Yang Kai’s understanding of his concern; a faint smile tugged at his lips.

Yang Kai quickly produced a jade vial containing Wan Yao Ling Milk and administered a little for Meng Wuya to drink.

Wan Yao Ling Milk was highly effective for treating grievous injuries; though Meng Wuya’s life signs were faint, it could at least stabilize his last breath.

He then produced the Blood Essence Stone.

A strong, steady thudding sounded from within the Blood Essence Stone.

As though sensing the vast blood energy contained within, Meng Wuya’s eyes cleared considerably.

The stone column had the power to draw the blood-and-flesh essence from those who had been bound. Meng Wuya’s qi and blood had been nearly drained dry by it; what he needed foremost was to replenish his Qi and blood.

With Qi and blood restored, he could regain vitality.

The Blood Essence Stone was undoubtedly the best choice.

With Wan Yao Ling Milk and the Blood Essence Stone used together, Yang Kai refused to believe Shopkeeper Meng couldn’t be brought back.

He channeled his True Yuan into the Blood Essence Stone, drawing the blood energy within and guiding it into Meng Wuya’s body.

As the blood energy flowed in, Shopkeeper Meng felt life returning; he closed his eyes cooperatively and let Yang Kai tend to him.

Time flowed slowly.

Visibly, Meng Wuya’s body underwent a dramatic transformation.

Like a deflated balloon being filled, his flesh gradually plumped; the gaunt frame regained fullness.

Countless wounds across his skin healed rapidly; his skin grew smoother and less wrinkled.

A full hour later Meng Wuya finally opened his eyes; they were deep as he looked at Yang Kai, his voice hoarse: “Let me handle it. You go take care of Ningshang.”

Yang Kai nodded, handed the Blood Essence Stone to Meng Wuya, and turned to assess the others.

The four yao were meditating to recover, motionless; after an hour of recuperation their complexions had improved markedly.

Yang Kai tucked a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye into the Pills he carried and gave one to each of them to take.

The four yao experts didn’t hesitate and immediately swallowed the Pills.

Only then did Yang Kai come to Xia Ningshang’s side.

Li Rong had been keeping watch the whole time, evidently understanding this veiled woman meant a great deal to Yang Kai, and she had not left her side.

Xia Ningshang was in much better shape than Meng Wuya — merely exhausted from having expended so much power and a little fainted.

Yang Kai gave her a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye and sat down to wait.

“Master…” Li Rong suddenly murmured, “Previously Li Rong failed to heed your command and has shamed our clan’s oath of loyalty; please punish me.”

“Hm?” Yang Kai, watching Xia Ningshang, looked up at Li Rong. After thinking a moment he understood why she had spoken that way.

“About that matter… don’t trouble yourself. I didn’t think it through and ordered you to strike at the Great Demon God’s Soul Incarnation; the fault isn’t yours.”

“But Master, our clan swore fealty to you; we must never hesitate at an order you give.”

“Don’t be so rigid. That was the Great Demon God’s Soul Incarnation — hesitation was unavoidable. If someday the Great Demon God himself returned and ordered you to strike me, would you hesitate then?”

Li Rong paused, unsure how to answer.

Yang Kai smiled, “Exactly. You hesitated because I am your Master. But the Great Demon God is the Great Demon God — his place in your hearts is unmatched. Let it go; don’t bring it up again.”

Li Rong pursed her lips, and after a long moment slightly nodded: “Yes!”

Then she gave a bright smile. “Master, this young lady must be your beloved, right?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai didn’t hide it; he admitted it plainly.

“No wonder Master looks at her so tenderly.” Li Rong smiled demurely. “I’ve never seen you look at any woman like that. Although the veil hides her face, she must be a peerless beauty.”

“A peerless beauty?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and chuckled. “I don’t know whether she’s that beautiful — I’ve never actually seen my little senior sister’s true face.”

“What?” Li Rong covered her mouth in surprise, incredulous: “You haven’t seen her real face?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

The thin veil Xia Ningshang wore was likely a mysterious Secret Treasure; Yang Kai hadn’t recognized its value before, but now he understood.

With that veil shrouding her, even attempts to probe with Divine Sense would only reveal a foggy, indistinct impression.

“Then your feelings for her must be very deep.” Li Rong concluded. If he hadn’t been deeply attached to a woman he had never seen, how could Yang Kai be so persistent?

Upon seeing her he wouldn't have lost his composure entirely.

To Li Rong, Yang Kai had always seemed calm and resolute; he rarely showed such strong emotion.

“Kid, what if she’s ugly? What then?” Lei Long the Great Lord suddenly asked.

Yang Kai glanced over and saw the two Great Lords had nearly recovered; Caidie and Jin Ni were still meditating.

The two Great Lords had obviously overheard the earlier conversation and couldn’t resist teasing.

“Not possible. My little senior sister’s heart is pure; to me she is a beauty.” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Lei Long frowned, then abruptly nodded, “Fair enough — whether pretty or not, what does it matter?”

“But don’t you want to see what she really looks like?” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox interjected, egging him on. “She’s unconscious now — perfect chance.”

“No. I’ll wait until she lifts the veil herself.” Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly. “If I let you see her now, it would only let you take advantage of her beauty.”

Lei Long laughed heartily. “Never thought you’d be so possessive, kid. Your beloved can’t even be glanced at by others?”

“None of your business!” Yang Kai snorted. It wasn’t that he minded others seeing Xia Ningshang’s face — he just wanted to be the one to see it first.

“I’m curious — what sect did you all come from? How did you reach this strength so young? Don’t tell me you’re from Tianxiao Sect; Tianxiao can’t do things like this.”

“I have another senior sister who’s the same.” Yang Kai chuckled, proud.

Lei Long’s face twitched. “If I get the chance, I want to see what kind of place raised such freaks as you.”

“Maybe one day…” Yang Kai’s expression darkened; he had no idea how he’d return to Zhongdu.

“Enough about that.” Lei Long shifted the topic, his face turning serious. “Earlier, between those eight stone pillars, what did you and that man talk about? Who was he, really?”

Their exchange with the Great Demon God’s Soul Incarnation had been telepathic, so the yao only saw their facial expressions and had no idea what was said.

“Isn’t there some speculation, Great Lord Lei Long?” Yang Kai smiled at him.

Lei Long’s eyelids tightened, shock crossing his features. “So… he really was the Great Demon God?”

“The Great Demon God?” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox exclaimed. “Impossible — isn’t that fellow long dead for thousands of years? How could he appear in a place like that?”

“Perhaps a lingering remnant of his soul.” Lei Long explained gravely. “Though he lacks a body, if even a fragment of his soul is that powerful, imagine the Great Demon God himself.”

Rumor had it the Great Demon God had refined himself to the pinnacle of this world’s power.

From the signs, he seemed to possess more than merely the means of reaching the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Three top-tier experts at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm and two at the Second Stage were powerless against the devices he laid out.

If the Great Demon God’s true body had really only been at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, he could never have achieved this level.
