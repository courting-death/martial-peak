## Chapter 2036 — Flourishing Moon Great Formation

After observing for a while, Yang Kai turned his gaze to the Fei Sheng Palace's tower-ship.

At that moment Ning Yuancheng stood on the deck with a serene, carefree expression, as if unconcerned about whether Liu Yizhi would be defeated; he fanned himself with a gilt folding fan, occasionally pointing and gesturing toward the front with the few disciples beside him.

Those disciples of Fei Sheng Palace naturally nodded hurriedly in agreement.

A curtain of green-phosphorescent light flowed around the tower-ship, enveloping the vessel.

This was clearly its protective formation.

Yang Kai frowned slightly.

With two Dao Origin-grade experts fighting in the distance it would have been an ideal moment to strike, but the formation on the tower-ship looked supremely solid. Yang Kai was not confident he could breach it with a single blow, and entering unnoticed was out of the question—if he approached at all his presence would be exposed.

He considered this for a long time and finally decided to hold his position and wait for the right moment.

With that thought he returned his attention to the battlefield between the two Dao Origin Realm fighters.

After such a long time, Liu Yizhi of Fei Sheng Palace and the man surnamed Han were still evenly matched; neither yielded to the other. But Yang Kai vaguely felt that something was off.

If the man surnamed Han had simply lacked confidence and rashly attacked people from Fei Sheng Palace, that would have been too reckless—he would not only achieve nothing but might also needlessly incur the enmity of the great Fei Sheng Palace; anyone with a scrap of sense would not behave so thoughtlessly.

Since the man surnamed Han chose to act here, he must have some backing.

Thinking this, Yang Kai was startled and felt somewhat relieved that he had not acted rashly earlier.


"Who exactly are you? Why not give your name? Sneaking about and making a spectacle—what's the point?" High in the air, Liu Yizhi held a Dao Origin-grade longknife Secret Treasure; light rippled along the blade. After clashing hard with the man surnamed Han, he stepped back and shouted.

Opposite him, the man surnamed Han was blown back by the force; a long sword in his hand turned lazily as he pointed at Liu Yizhi and sneered, "If you can't recognize me, that's your ignorance—yet you blame others; how ridiculous."

Liu Yizhi frowned and barked, "I know your surname is Han. But there are so many people surnamed Han in the world; I do not care what your background is. If you withdraw now, Liu will treat today's matter as if it never happened; but if you persist in troubling us, then you are an enemy of Fei Sheng Palace, and Liu will show no mercy!"

"Fei Sheng Palace!" the man surnamed Han laughed when he heard that and mocked, "So scary—do you really think a mere Fei Sheng Palace could make Han hesitate? Never mind Fei Sheng Palace, what of Star God Palace? Star God Palace has wanted my life for years, yet am I not still living quite comfortably?"


Liu Yizhi was taken aback; those words struck him oddly.

In the entire Southern Territory Star God Palace was the undisputed overlord—no one dared to defy it. Yet the man's remarks implied he harbored a grudge with Star God Palace and had been living untroubled despite it.

"You... you are..." A rumor from more than ten years ago suddenly surfaced in Liu Yizhi's mind; his expression changed and he pointed at the man, "I know who you are now—you are the Star God Palace traitor Han Leng!"

More than ten years ago a disciple under an Emperor Realm elder of Star God Palace had committed a grave crime; by Star God Palace's rules he should have been executed. Yet he somehow learned of it in advance, killed the Senior Brothers who were guarding him, escaped from Star God Palace, and vanished without a trace.

The matter had caused an uproar at the time; many disciples of Star God Palace went out seeking news and traces of the traitor, hoping to capture him and bring him back to face justice, but none succeeded—instead, the traitor took the opportunity to kill many who pursued him.

The affair remained a stain on Star God Palace; other sects dared not speak of it openly, only whispering of it in private.

Over the past ten-plus years Star God Palace had never relaxed its pursuit of that traitor, yet they had still never succeeded.

Later there were rumors that the traitor was the illegitimate son of that Emperor Realm elder, and that the elder himself had secretly helped him escape; whether such rumors were true no one could say.

As a high-ranking member of Fei Sheng Palace, Liu Yizhi had naturally come into contact with such secrets and knew that the traitor was called Han Leng.

At first Liu Yizhi had not suspected the Han man's true identity, but when the man spoke those words, he instantly realized the truth.

"So you truly are that Star God Palace traitor Han Leng!"

"So what if I am?" Han Leng did not hide it at all; a crafty grin spread across his face as he chuckled, "Now that you recognize me, it's already too late!"


At those words Liu Yizhi's heart lurched and he whispered, "Not good."

He turned and flew toward the tower-ship, his face drained of color as if something terrible were about to happen.

Then Han Leng's expression suddenly turned solemn; he formed a seal. As the hand signs shifted, the bright moon in the sky flared with brilliant radiance, dazzling the eyes and making it nearly impossible to see anything ahead.


A pillar of pure white light suddenly shot down from the bright moon and poured into Han Leng.

The next moment, centered on Han Leng, rays of moonlight radiated in all directions.

In no more than three breaths an inexplicable power enveloped dozens of li, isolating the area from the rest of the world; looking up, the sky filled with silver moons of every shape—full moons, waning moons, crescent moons—yet not a single star could be seen.

The place seemed to have become another world.

"Flourishing Moon Great Formation!" Liu Yizhi's face drained of color as he blurted out the name of the change.

"Heh heh heh." Han Leng's body had already vanished; only his voice radiated from all directions, making it impossible to tell its source. "That's right—you can identify this formation; you may now die with peace."

"When did you set this up?" Liu Yizhi asked, his face ashen.

"Knowing you are people of Fei Sheng Palace makes it easy to anticipate your route; what of setting up a formation in advance? What's the big deal? Blame only your Young Palace Lord for being arrogant, thinking Fei Sheng Palace is untouchable," Han Leng's voice continued to drift out.

Not far away on the tower-ship, Ning Yuancheng's face also turned grim.

Although he remained on the ship and appeared perfectly safe, he too had been wrapped within the Flourishing Moon Great Formation. From Liu Yizhi's fearful demeanor he could tell this formation was no ordinary device.

After a moment's thought he shouted to the Fei Sheng Palace disciples on the ship, "All of you hurry out to support Deacon Liu; I will remain here to back you up!"

On the tower-ship, besides him, were a dozen or so Void King Realm martial artists, most of whom were of the Second or Third Stage of the Void King Realm; combined they still formed a not-insignificant force.

Hearing this, those men did not hesitate much; they used movement techniques to launch from the tower-ship and go to meet Liu Yizhi.

"Do not go out!" Liu Yizhi instinctively shouted, but it was already too late.


The instant those men flew out, the countless silver moons in the sky flashed and shot streams of clear moonlight; at first glance the moonlight seemed calm and harmless, without overt killing intent.

The Fei Sheng Palace disciples were veteran fighters and dodged instinctively, seeking to avoid the moonlight.

But one of the Second Stage Void King Realm warriors couldn't evade in time—a sweep of moonlight scraped across half his body.

Silently, the left half of his body began to melt away.

His protective Saint Yuan had no effect.

Sensing something was terribly wrong, he turned his head to look—and what he saw nearly made his soul flee his body.

A scream rang out; the man plunged headfirst toward the ground and was dead before he hit.

That grotesque sight made everyone inhale sharply, chills running down their spines.

"You... ah!" Liu Yizhi sighed heavily; although he harbored resentment toward Ning Yuancheng, he could not say much, and instead he changed his tone: "Since you have come out, then break the formation with me! The Flourishing Moon Great Formation is indeed formidable, but the one who set it is not supremely skilled; let us join forces and carve a bloody path out."

Those Void King Realm warriors, who had been thrown into disarray by their comrade's death, steadied themselves after Liu Yizhi's reassurance and gathered around him.

Han Leng's cold laughter echoed from all directions, his figure nowhere to be seen; at his urging the countless silver moons flashed again and beams of moonlight shot out in a crisscross barrage toward the Fei Sheng Palace group.

"Block!" Liu Yizhi roared, swinging his longknife first; the blade light erupted and formed a giant radiance tens of zhang long that smashed forward. The others dared not slacken and hurriedly unleashed secret techniques and summoned their Secret Treasures.

In an instant, multicolored lights glittered as they collided with the silver rays.

But after only a short while, the silver light breached the combined defenses of the Fei Sheng Palace group and pressed onward.

Liu Yizhi's eyes narrowed as he suddenly bellowed, "Scatter!"

Those who reacted quickly darted aside; the slightly slower ones, alerted by Liu's shout, were fortunate enough to escape.

As a result, the Fei Sheng Palace group that had just clustered together was scattered and broken apart.

Before they could regroup, the Flourishing Moon Great Formation's power surged once more and countless beams of moonlight flashed forth.

This time the Fei Sheng Palace disciples were not so fortunate; they had only just steadied themselves—not even able to catch their breath—when three of them, unable to evade the incoming moonlight, were struck head-on by the attack.
