## Chapter 2522 — Ancient Medicine Garden

Within the misty small world, dense Spiritual Qi hung in the air, so thick it seemed almost tangible, casting a milky-white glow throughout the space. At a glance, it looked as if the entire realm was stuffed full of billowing clouds of cotton.

This whole small world was only about a dozen li across. It didn’t seem to have formed naturally, but rather bore traces of being artificially refined.

No one knew which ancient expert or extraordinary figure had created it.

The air was thick with all kinds of medicinal fragrances, so rich they were almost overwhelming.

On the ground within this dozen-li area, there were more than a dozen separated medicine plots. Most of them were now empty, with only fertile soil remaining, and the earth bore many traces of harvesting. It looked like someone had already collected all the Spiritual Herbs here.

This small world was actually an ancient medicine garden!

One could imagine just how many rare flowers and exotic herbs had once been planted in those plots, and how much medicinal potency and age had accumulated over countless years.

Only two medicine plots remained intact, covering just two or three li each. In these two plots, ten-thousand-year-old rare flowers and exotic herbs grew everywhere, thriving. The rich medicinal fragrance in the air was precisely what these Spiritual Herbs were releasing.

Around these two medicine gardens, a faint golden barrier shimmered, seemingly a restriction.

At this moment, Gao Xueting’s hair was disheveled, her pretty face pale, and she sat cross-legged somewhere in the medicine garden, weakly healing with her eyes closed. The Imperial Treasure, Scorching Sun Mirror, floated above her head, emitting a gentle light that enveloped her.

On her snow-white dress, blossoms of crimson blood bloomed, and at her waist and abdomen, a half-zhang-long wound had stained that patch of clothing bright red.

She seemed to have just fought a fierce battle. All her Emperor Yuan was nearly exhausted, and even while healing, her delicate body couldn’t help but tremble slightly.

Although there were countless precious Spiritual Herbs and wondrous medicines here, they still couldn’t let her recover her strength in a short time.

Outside that golden barrier, a man wielded a Starfire Sea-Cleaving Blade, constantly sending blade lights crashing against the restriction. Each strike thundered, making the barrier tremble as if it could shatter at any moment.

But no one knew whose handiwork this barrier was. It looked extremely thin, but was actually incredibly sturdy. Despite the man’s relentless attacks, it still hadn’t been broken.

This restriction had become the greatest obstacle separating this man from Gao Xueting. Enraged, he howled madly, like a lunatic.

Gao Xueting slowly opened her eyes. She gazed coldly at the man attacking the barrier and spoke in a calm, detached voice, “Ju Tianqing, we’ve known each other for centuries, yet only today do I truly see your face. I must say, it’s quite the surprise.”

Ju Tianqing shouted angrily, “Shut your mouth, wench! Once this Lord breaks this restriction, I’ll make sure to properly dote on you!”

Disgust and fury flashed in Gao Xueting’s beautiful eyes as she shouted, “Give up! Even if I have to sever my own Meridians and self-destruct, I won’t let you touch a single hair on me.”

Ju Tianqing snorted, “That depends on whether you get the chance. You’re gravely injured now, barely able to move. Once I break this restriction, you’ll have no say in what happens next.”

Gao Xueting retorted angrily, “I am an Elder of the Qingyang Shrine! If I die here today, one day you’ll be hunted to death by my Qingyang Shrine!”

Ju Tianqing sneered and said, “Qingyang Shrine is indeed impressive. I respect Hall Master Wen Zishan’s strength, but so what? Your Qingyang Shrine only throws its weight around in the Southern Territory. This is the Eastern Territory! No matter how strong Hall Master Wen is, can he come here and act recklessly? Even a mighty dragon can’t suppress a local snake. Since I’ve set my sights on you, I’m not afraid of your Qingyang Shrine’s revenge!”

Hearing this, despair flashed in Gao Xueting’s eyes. Gravely wounded, she could only hide in this medicine garden. Fortunately, there was a restriction left by an ancient master, which she managed to activate. But she had no idea how long it would last. If Ju Tianqing really broke through, she’d have no strength to resist.

She secretly resolved that if the restriction was destroyed, she would self-destruct immediately. Even in death, she would not let her purity be defiled.

Uncontrollably, a certain roguish smile, lazy tone, and infuriating attitude surfaced in her mind. The sharpness in Gao Xueting’s eyes gradually softened.

So what if you raised me? I stopped being a child at eighteen.

Yet even after cultivating to the Emperor Realm, in his eyes, I’m still just a little girl, never once treated as a woman.

If there’s a next life, I’ll never let you raise me! I’ll grow up healthy, and then, as a woman, stand before you again!

“Brother Zu, have you rested enough? If so, how about coming over to lend a hand?” Ju Tianqing, unable to break through after so long, grew anxious and called out to another Emperor Realm cultivator who was sitting cross-legged nearby, healing.

This man was none other than Zu Hong, City Lord of Kunyuan City.

The three here were all of similar strength, each at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm. If they really fought, their abilities would be evenly matched.

The reason Gao Xueting was so badly injured wasn’t because she was weaker than Ju Tianqing, but because she was outnumbered by Ju Tianqing and Zu Hong.

Battles between cultivators of the same level were always extremely dangerous. For Gao Xueting to injure one of them while fighting two alone was proof of her strength.

Zu Hong’s face was pale as well. Beside him lay a massive seal, carved with countless fierce beasts, its aura surging and ebbing. As he breathed in and out, the flesh around his wounds writhed and slowly knit itself back together—who knew what mysterious technique he was cultivating?

Hearing Ju Tianqing’s call, Zu Hong opened his eyes and frowned, “Brother Ju, you didn’t tell me beforehand that we’d be dealing with an Elder of the Qingyang Shrine.”

Ju Tianqing laughed, “What, are you scared? Qingyang Shrine is indeed famous, on par with my Brahma Heaven Sacred Land, but that’s a Southern Territory sect. Why should you fear them?”

Zu Hong replied, “You may not be afraid, Brother Ju. Brahma Heaven Sacred Land is powerful, and Qingyang Shrine is impressive, but after this, you can just hide in your Sacred Land and Qingyang Shrine can’t touch you. But I’m just a city lord. If Wen Zishan really comes to the Eastern Territory, I’ll be crushed to dust.”

Ju Tianqing’s mouth twitched. “Brother Zu, aren’t you worrying too much? We’ve done this so secretly, who says Qingyang Shrine will even find out? Even if they do, there’s no evidence. What are you afraid of?”

Zu Hong shook his head. “Caution is best. You have a powerful backer, but people like me with no sect or faction have it tough.”

Ju Tianqing sneered, “At this point, you’re not thinking of backing out, are you?”

Zu Hong pondered, “Not quite. After all, I helped you injure Elder Gao. Even if I wanted to quit, I couldn’t wash my hands of it now.”

Ju Tianqing said, “Since you understand, what are you hesitating for?”

Zu Hong said, “Earlier, you told me there was a great opportunity here and we’d split the benefits fifty-fifty, so I agreed without hesitation. But now, it seems that split isn’t quite fair.”

Ju Tianqing was taken aback. “How so? This is an ancient medicine garden, full of rare herbs. Once we deal with that woman, we’ll split all the Spiritual Herbs evenly. Don’t you trust my word?”

Zu Hong grinned, “We can split the Spiritual Herbs, but what about that virgin yin energy… how do you plan to split that with me?”

Ju Tianqing’s expression turned odd. “How could that be split?”

Yin energy isn’t like other things—it simply can’t be divided.

Suddenly, Zu Hong said, “Brother Ju, you’ve been stuck at the peak of the First Stage of the Emperor Realm for years. I heard you practiced a dual cultivation technique to improve your strength, collecting yin energy from many women—even your two direct disciples weren’t spared. If you take Elder Gao today, will you break through and reach the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm?”

Being exposed like this, Ju Tianqing’s face darkened, especially at the mention of his disciples…

This was a closely guarded secret. Who knew how Zu Hong found out?

“I think I get your point, Brother Zu.” Ju Tianqing nodded, snorted, and said, “If you want to name your terms, just say it. We’ve known each other for years—no need to beat around the bush.”

Zu Hong raised his brows and chuckled, “Don’t be angry, Brother Ju. I’m just speaking plainly. If helping you really lets you break through, I’ll give it my all. Breaking through the Emperor Realm is incredibly hard—one step is like climbing to the heavens. If you reach the Second Stage, it’s a blessing from the heavens, not something pills or medicines can give.”

“Speak plainly!” Ju Tianqing said impatiently.

Zu Hong looked embarrassed. “I want a seventy-thirty split on the Spiritual Herbs! You take three, I take seven!”

Ju Tianqing’s face darkened. “You’re getting greedy! Every Spiritual Herb here is at least ten thousand years old, all Imperial-Grade, planted by some ancient master. Many are long lost and priceless. Yet you want seventy percent? How about you take thirty percent and Elder Gao, and I take seventy percent—how’s that?”

Zu Hong grinned, “What would I want with Elder Gao? Beautiful as she is, she’s all thorns—I can’t enjoy that. Besides, I’m just bargaining here, Brother Ju.”
