## Chapter 2469 — Origin Sea

Northern Territory, Wenqing Sect.

As one of the top Sects in the Northern Territory, Wenqing Sect sprawled across vast lands, with countless disciples and grand, imposing buildings everywhere, exuding an extraordinary aura. The Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth was also extremely dense here.

Suddenly, a thunderous roar erupted from an inconspicuous building, and in an instant, it seemed as if the entire Wenqing Sect was trembling. Countless disciples turned their gazes toward the source of the sound, their eyes filled with shock.

Everyone recognized it as the voice of the Sect Master, but none knew why the Sect Master had suddenly become so enraged.

Feng Xuan was already an expert at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, his mind as calm as still water, unshaken by anything. Unless he encountered something utterly unacceptable, it was impossible for him to lose his composure like this.

And what could possibly enrage a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert to such an extent?

At that moment, a pale-faced man rushed into the building in a panic, pushed open the door, and knelt trembling on the floor, stammering, "Sect Master, something terrible has happened! I just received word, the Young Sect Master's soul lamp..."

Before the man could finish, Feng Xuan suddenly struck out with his palm.

Although this man possessed the powerful cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, before a powerhouse like Feng Xuan, he stood no chance. With a single palm, he was smashed into a bloody pulp.

"Yang Kai!" In the secret chamber, Feng Xuan's face was ashen, his expression twisted with rage as he spat out a name, his eyes blazing with fury.

He had used Soul Descent to possess Feng Xi, so even though he was in Wenqing Sect, he could still sense some of what was happening in the Shattered Star Sea. Though not completely, he had felt Feng Xi's death with absolute clarity.

His son had finally managed to break through to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea, only to be killed by someone at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. And this happened even while he was using Soul Descent! This was a humiliation beyond compare, both for himself and for Wenqing Sect.

If he could enter the Shattered Star Sea, he would have already set out to settle accounts with Yang Kai.

The hatred of a murdered son was irreconcilable. Rage surged in Feng Xuan's heart. Suddenly, he rose, turned into a stream of light, and shot out of Wenqing Sect, heading in a certain direction.

Judging by the direction, it seemed he was heading toward the Ice Heart Valley.

He could not seek out Yang Kai right now, so he could only go to Ice Heart Valley to find Bing Yun. No matter what, Yang Kai had to die, and only by finding Bing Yun could he learn Yang Kai's whereabouts.

Feng Xi's death had driven him into a frenzy. He no longer cared about the rivalry between the two factions. If Bing Yun could not give him a satisfactory explanation, he would bathe Ice Heart Valley in blood!

……

In a daze, Yang Kai felt someone calling out to him. He struggled for a long time before suddenly opening his eyes and regaining consciousness.

"You finally woke up!" a voice suddenly sounded by his ear.

Yang Kai's heart stirred. He immediately knew that the one calling him was none other than his Incarnation.

He and his Incarnation had always shared a connection through their Divine Souls, so even separated by the Small Xuan Realm, the Incarnation could contact him at any time.

When Yang Kai had suddenly fainted earlier, the Incarnation did not dare to pull him into the Small Xuan Realm for healing. Although it was possible, doing so would expose the Xuan Realm Pearl.

There were countless experts in the Shattered Star Sea. If anyone saw the Xuan Realm Pearl, it would surely cause trouble.

So the Incarnation could only let Yang Kai drift in the void, constantly calling out to him.

"How long has it been?" Yang Kai communicated with his Incarnation via Divine Sense, barely managing to sit up.

"Not long, just a few hours."

"That's good." Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief, checked his current condition, and found his injuries were not too serious. He had only been struck by a gust of wind from Feng Xuan, leaving his back bloody and mangled.

The biggest problem now was his weakness. Using the Mountain and River Bell had drained all his strength, leaving him unable to fully recover in these few hours. Even now, moving his Divine Sense made his head throb with pain. If he encountered any danger at this moment, he would have to hide in the Xuan Realm Pearl immediately.

After thinking for a moment, he summoned his wooden boat, letting it speed forward on its own. Sitting cross-legged atop the boat, Yang Kai took out a few Spiritual Pills for recovery, popped them into his mouth, and closed his eyes to meditate and regulate his breathing.

In the desolate and ancient Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai's figure was like a speck of dust, utterly inconspicuous, drifting aimlessly without any particular destination.

Two days later, he finally let out a long breath and stood up again, his body crackling all over.

Although he had not fully recovered, his body was no longer in any real danger.

Looking around, he saw nothing special. Even his Seven-Pointed Star Seal did not sense anyone else's presence.

He had been in the Shattered Star Sea for two or three years now. He once thought he had gained a lot, but after meeting the people from Ice Heart Valley and Feng Xi, he realized he had fallen behind.

Even Feng Xi had already advanced to the Emperor Realm, and Zi Yu was at a critical moment of her breakthrough—she might have already succeeded and become an Emperor by now. But as for himself, he had not even sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough.

The True Phoenix Fire and Mountain and River Bell were indeed impressive, once owned by Great Emperors, but a martial artist's true strength always lay in their own power. External aids were just icing on the cake.

Without strong personal strength as a foundation, no matter how many treasures one possessed, they would be of little use. Yang Kai felt that if he were already in the Emperor Realm, he would not have been so embarrassed when using the Mountain and River Bell earlier.

Zi Yu and Feng Xi had already surpassed him. What about the other geniuses from the various Sects? And those other rising stars he knew?

Yang Kai suddenly felt a pressing sense of crisis.

Falling behind in cultivation was true failure. Even if he found countless treasures in the Shattered Star Sea, it would be meaningless.

As he pondered, he controlled the wooden boat to speed through the Shattered Star Sea, searching for his own opportunity.

For several days in a row, Yang Kai did not encounter a single person, nor did he sense any trace of Origin Power. This struck him as odd, since he had never experienced such a thing during his time in the Shattered Star Sea.

Several more days passed, and Yang Kai still sensed nothing.

This made him increasingly suspicious, wondering what had changed in the Shattered Star Sea.

It was not until the tenth day that Yang Kai suddenly felt a slight warmth on the back of his hand.

This made his spirits rise. He immediately realized he was sensing the presence of other martial artists, and the warmth on the back of his hand grew stronger and stronger.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and hurried in that direction.

As he drew closer, Yang Kai was filled with astonishment, for he sensed the auras of many martial artists ahead. Not only that, but there was also an extremely dense aura of Origin Power.

All of it resonated with the Star Seal on the back of his hand.

What on earth was going on over there? His curiosity grew, and he sped up even more.

Half a day later, the scene before his eyes left Yang Kai momentarily stunned.

In the starry sky ahead, countless tens of thousands of li away, a vast swath of deep blue radiance stretched out, forming an irregular ellipse. At a glance, it looked like a boundless ocean.

Although it did not seem that large from a distance, Yang Kai knew this was only because he was still far away. If he were actually inside, he would surely feel its immense scale.

"What the hell is that?" Yang Kai muttered to himself.

After a few more hours, Yang Kai had already arrived at this strange place.

When he saw the situation clearly, Yang Kai gasped and exclaimed, "So much Origin Power?"

He could distinctly sense the rich aura of Origin Power emanating from within that deep blue radiance. Those fragmented traces of Origins were hidden amidst the azure glow, just like fish concealed beneath the waves of the sea.

Now that he was closer, this place truly resembled a vast ocean. He could not see the end at a glance. The blue waves surged, and the light ebbed and flowed like seawater, looking extremely strange.

Through the Star Seal on the back of his hand, Yang Kai could clearly sense countless martial artists scattered throughout the vast blue radiance. He wondered if they were absorbing and refining Origin Power.

But... how could there be so much Origin Power here? If one person could refine and absorb all these Origins, how great would the benefits be? Yang Kai did not dare to imagine it.

But that was basically impossible. No martial artist could possibly refine all this Origin Power alone.

No wonder he had not encountered anyone or sensed any Origin Power for more than ten days—everyone had gathered here.

Yang Kai's heart surged with excitement. Although he wanted to rush in and seize the Origin Power before him, he still carefully examined the situation within the blue radiance.

To his surprise, his Divine Sense encountered no obstacles and sensed no danger. It was as if the blue light was just like seawater, merely the vessel for the dense Origin Power.

Yang Kai's face lit up with joy. He leapt forward and plunged into the radiance.

"Hahaha, another fool!" A mocking voice rang out nearby. This person had clearly been watching Yang Kai, and when he saw him charge into the blue radiance, he burst out laughing, jeering, "To rush blindly into the Origin Sea—do you not know what death is?"

Before he finished speaking, a figure suddenly shot out from where Yang Kai had entered.

The man looked closely and saw that it was none other than Yang Kai.

His eyes widened in shock. "How is this possible? He's still alive?"

At this moment, Yang Kai was gritting his teeth in pain, his whole body aching. Hissing sounds came from all over his body, and in an instant, his clothes were corroded away, revealing his sturdy physique.

His skin looked as if it had been scalded by boiling water, covered in countless blisters and mangled flesh—a terrifying sight.

Though he looked miserable, Yang Kai's life was not in danger. He circulated his Origin Qi, expelling the corrosive force invading his body.
