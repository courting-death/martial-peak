## Chapter 904 — Stone Platform

“If we go any farther, we’ll have to follow those stone platforms upward.” Lei Long, the Great Lord, looked up again.

There was no path along the cliff on either side; ahead lay that strange emerald-green sea, but square stone platforms roughly one zhang across floated in midair.

Like a stone staircase, each slab higher than the last, the sequence stretched on and on into the distance, with no end in sight.

Above the emerald sea, fierce, unnatural gales howled, seeming to carry some peculiar force that made anyone hesitate to fly by will.

“Shall we go up?” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox hesitated, unsure whether to continue exploring.

Although there was a road of stone platforms ahead, no one could guarantee there weren’t greater dangers further on.

“We’ve come this far; I won’t turn back until I’ve scouted it out,” Lei Long said in a low voice, then stepped onto the first platform and began ascending.

Caidie followed closely behind without the slightest hesitation.

“Kid, follow Lei Long—Old Ox will cover the rear!” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox kindly told Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded, and, together with Li Rong, the two of them stepped onto the platforms.

The platforms were spaced close enough that a raised foot could reach them, forming a ladder that seemed to lead straight to the heavens, delving into that endless void.

Lei Long moved slowly, vigilantly scanning the surroundings as he went, cautious to an extreme degree.

After climbing roughly a hundred slabs with nothing unusual occurring, the party could not help but relax somewhat.

But before long, faces bobbing up and down in the green sea below began to emit violent howls; they broke free from the viscous water’s restraint and lunged up like vengeful spirits, claws flashing, their appearance terrifying.

Countless Spirit Bodies tore free of the sea’s bonds at that moment, like cats detecting the scent of fish—their target was Yang Kai and his companions.

The cries of ghosts and wolves swelled, cold winds howled, and those translucent Spirit Bodies attacked from all sides.

Everyone’s faces drained of color, not understanding why such a calamity had come about.

In an instant the slab where the six stood was enveloped by Spirit Bodies; wave after wave of terrifying Divine Sense burst forth from those transparent forms, dense and overwhelming.

Even mighty warriors like Lei Long and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox felt a crushing illusion that their wills were being shattered, nearly losing the ability to move.

Lei Long bellowed; arcs of lightning danced across his body and, in an instant, formed a bluish curtain of light.

Swish, swish, swish...

The lightning’s brilliance painted the sky; the Divine Sense assaults made the blue barrier ripple, and within moments it showed signs of collapsing.

A layer of earth-yellow light also bloomed around the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox; together the two Great Lords held off the onslaught from all sides.

Caidie twirled like a dancer, iridescent radiance unfurling as strange beams shot outward like arrows, hindering the Spirit Bodies’ advance.

Li Rong and Jin Ni likewise did their utmost, deploying their own measures.

Yet the forces discharged by those Spirit Bodies carried a despairing profound intent that settled over everyone’s hearts, making them anxious and fearful.

“Move!” Lei Long roared, increasing his pace; the other five followed one after another, racing across the platforms as fast as they could.

Puff...

The defenses the two Great Lords had formed were formidable, but they could not withstand so many assaults; after advancing less than thirty zhang, the barriers shattered with a roar.

The Spirit Bodies swarming about grew even more frenzied, attacking like a plague of locusts.

These soulless, monstrous Spirit Bodies seemed to know how to prey on the weak; seeing Lei Long’s group’s strength, they instead directed their fury at the one who had not yet fought and was the weakest—Yang Kai.

Translucent Spirit Bodies lunged and clawed at him; though the group blocked many, a few slipped through and reached Yang Kai.

They plunged into him, entering his body and vanishing.

“My lord!” Li Rong’s face paled; she threw herself toward Yang Kai regardless of the Spirit Bodies between them.

A lightning bolt streaked from ahead, resolving Li Rong’s crisis, but it could not prevent the Spirit Bodies from surging into Yang Kai.

In an instant Yang Kai’s expression twisted in agony; his eyes turned blood-red and his whole body trembled.

A chill seized everyone—he had been affected by the grudges within those Spirit Bodies; each of them had been a master in life, at least Saint Realm, trapped for countless years in the emerald sea; their undying souls, their hate and despair, were not something a cultivator at Yang Kai’s level could withstand.

It was possible his spirit had already been wiped and his flesh occupied.

Lei Long stood momentarily stunned, unsure how to respond.

At that moment a sliver of brilliance flared in Yang Kai’s eyes; he seemed to find relief, visibly relaxed, exhaled heavily, and, shaken, said, “Hurry up and go—what are you dawdling for?”

“You... you’re all right?” Lei Long asked, astonished.

Being invaded by Spirit Bodies was instantaneous, and his recovery was just as quick; it all happened so fast no one reacted in time—Lei Long could not fathom how Yang Kai emerged unscathed.

More than one Spirit Body had entered him.

“If you don’t leave now, everyone will be in trouble!” Yang Kai said with grave expression.

Lei Long had no time to inquire; he unleashed his full strength to clear the path, lightning arcs lancing out to keep those Spirit Bodies at bay as they strode forward across slab after slab.

Li Rong stayed by Yang Kai, fending off the resentful presences while quietly observing him; after a moment her eyes lit up—she finally understood why Yang Kai remained unharmed.

Within his Sea of Consciousness, the World-Ending Demon Eye of the Great Demon God remained!

The golden light of the World-Ending Demon Eye is supremely antagonistic to souls; any Spirit Body daring to enter Yang Kai’s body was courting death.

After that incident, the Spirit Bodies instinctively sensed the danger and no longer dared approach the six; they circled nearby, issuing anguished cries.

Lei Long and the others, puzzled, nonetheless crossed the platforms with greater ease.

After an incense’s worth of time, they followed the platforms into that void of chaotic sky.

Stepping down from the final slab, their expressions turned to utter bewilderment.

Because this was not a chaotic void at all, but another patch of solid ground.

As when they first entered, the ground beneath their feet was barren; yet overhead a brilliant light poured forth, multicolored radiance streaking by like arrows, swift as meteors.

They seemed almost within reach, yet impossible to grasp.

“What a strange place!” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox shook his head.

Lei Long cautiously released his Divine Sense to scout the area; after confirming there was no nearby danger, he said, “We’ll rest for a while.”

Traversing the stone platforms had exhausted enormous reserves of power; in such a perilous realm it was necessary to maintain peak condition.

Even Lei Long the Great Lord dared not be careless.

No one objected; all sat cross-legged to recover spirit and strength.

The two Great Lords conferred in low tones, glancing now and then at Yang Kai.

Although meditating with closed eyes, their scrutiny did not escape Yang Kai’s perception.

He opened his eyes and grinned: “Are you two Great Lords suspecting the kid’s been taken over?”

Lei Long frowned, no longer hiding it, and nodded: “Indeed. Old Ox and I had that suspicion, but judging by the way you speak, it seems you have not been possessed by those Spirit Bodies.”

“Of course not.” Yang Kai nodded.

“What proof can you give?” Lei Long demanded. “Kid, I can’t understand how you resisted those Spirit Bodies. If you can’t prove you’re still the same person, I will seal away your power—hope you understand.”

“How do you want me to prove it?” Yang Kai frowned; he understood their concerns and did not feel wronged.

“Anything that can prove you are still the original person will do.”

“No need for proof—I can guarantee he is our lord! I won’t ever mistake whom I serve.” Li Rong spoke up.

Lei Long and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox exchanged a glance, looked between Yang Kai and Li Rong, and after a long moment nodded: “Fine, we’ll trust this lady’s judgment; honestly, we don’t want to see you possessed either.”

“Both Great Lords mean well; I understand,” Yang Kai said with a slight bow.

The matter passed, and they resumed their recovery.

Half a day later, they continued forward to explore.

After passing the emerald sea, they seemed to have entered a new realm.

In that sky, streaks of meteor-like brilliance flashed by and vanished, too quick to leave any trace.

What surprised them was that, despite walking for a long time, they encountered no anomalies and nothing of note.

Everyone felt as if they were treading an endless road, with no way out and no path back.

That eerie, unchanging feeling gradually sank everyone’s spirits to the lowest depths.

Time passed—they lost track of how long they’d been there—yet they still had found nothing.

The hot-tempered Earth-Splitting Divine Ox grew exceedingly impatient, cursing constantly and growing agitated.

Even Lei Long the Great Lord showed regret; had he known it would be like this he would not have ventured in—now they could not find the way back and could only press onward, hoping to discover something special.
