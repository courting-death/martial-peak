## Chapter 1275 — Yin Pool

"Noted!" Yang Kai nodded slightly, then glanced at Daiyuan as if remembering something and said, "Your mind isn't steady right now. Do this: rest for two days, and after two days we will begin. How does that sound?"

Although Daiyuan was eager to begin immediately, since Yang Kai had said it she could not argue; she nodded in agreement, discussed a few minor details with Yang Kai, and then took her leave.

After Daiyuan left, Yang Kai sat on the stone bed, stroked his chin and pondered for a moment. Then, with a sweep of his large hand, many medicinal ingredients instantly appeared on the bed.

He then took out his refining furnace, ignited his Divine Sense Fire, and wrapped those different herbs one by one, refining the medicinal liquors contained within.

Two days passed in the blink of an eye. When Yang Kai opened his eyes from meditation, his Divine Sense swept outward and discovered Daiyuan standing outside. After two days of recuperation and adjustment, her mood and emotions had calmed; her expression was neither joyous nor sorrowful. She stood at the door without urging him, quietly waiting for Yang Kai to come out on his own.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, pleased that she had steadied herself, quickly rose, descended the stone bed, and opened the door.

Hearing the movement, Daiyuan raised her eyelids and, upon seeing Yang Kai, gave him a faint smile.

"Let's go!" Yang Kai signaled, and Daiyuan nodded, immediately leading the way.

They returned to that vast stone chamber they had passed before. Daiyuan led Yang Kai down another corridor that seemed to descend deep underground, spiraling inward. Steps had been carved out by hand so it never felt steep. Along both sides of the corridor were odd stones used for lighting, diffusing a soft radiance.

As Daiyuan went downward, Yang Kai said nothing, yet his Divine Sense continued to spread below.

Halfway down, Yang Kai suddenly sensed a chill coming toward them. This chill was not simple cold but a bone-deep, gooseflesh-inducing yin cold; strictly speaking, it was a surge of yin qi—only where yin qi gathers can such a keening cold arise.

It seemed the so-called Yin Pool was hidden below, and Yang Kai's mind brightened at the thought.

This yin cold posed no real trouble to Yang Kai; he needn't even circulate his Saint Yuan—his flesh could easily withstand it. Daiyuan was the same. Though her physical body could not match Yang Kai's, her cultivation stood where it was, and this Yin Pool had been here for many years. Daiyuan would have come down countless times to probe and prepare for purification; naturally she would not be affected.

The further they went, the stronger the sense of yin cold became.

After a while, Daiyuan could no longer avoid circulating her Saint Yuan to protect her body; a faint glow appeared over her skin, keeping the yin cold at bay.

They traveled downward for a long time before the space suddenly opened up. Below there was another huge stone chamber, but it was empty to the eye. Yet that chamber was filled with an intense, congealed yin cold, strands and waves of it suffusing every corner.

Frost had formed thickly on the surrounding stone walls; the temperature here had dropped to a shocking degree.

In the very center of the chamber lay a small pool, covering less than three zhang, like a sheet of water; the filaments of yin cold were emanating from that little pool.

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly. "Miss Daiyuan, is this Yin Pool a thousand-year Yin Pool or a ten-thousand-year Yin Pool?"

Daiyuan seemed to know what Yang Kai meant and smiled when she replied, "According to what that senior said, this Yin Pool formed at the very least five or six thousand years ago."

Yang Kai frowned. "With such an age, the yin-cold water of this Yin Pool is not something you can endure. Are you sure you still want to proceed?"

Yin Pools vary by age. Yang Kai hadn't heard Daiyuan mention the pool before; he had assumed immersion would not be too dangerous and thus hadn't asked further. He had not expected this Yin Pool to be five or six thousand years old—such a pool would freeze Daiyuan into an ice sculpture the moment she entered.

Daiyuan smiled slightly. "Junior Brother Yang, rest assured. I have made many preparations beforehand and have mixed many fire-aligned and yang-aligned herbs into the pool water to neutralize some of that yin cold. Besides, I am a pill master and practice a fire-aligned technique; if I'm careful there should be no problem. Moreover... if I don't go on now, I'll be left to die. If you were in my current situation, what would you choose?"

Yang Kai fell silent, understanding that Daiyuan was forced by circumstances and had her own reasons; he ceased his persuasion.

“Junior Brother Yang, rest assured. I’ve already left a letter in my meditation room. If something really happens this time and I fall here, you can take that letter and hand it to my Master. Everything is explained in it. After reading it, she won’t make things difficult for you. My Master is Elder Gong Aofu, who resides on Wanren Peak. When you leave, you may seek her out.”

She spoke as if arranging matters for death, which made Yang Kai's heart ache, yet he still nodded, "I understand."

Daiyuan smiled and inclined her head, beckoning, "Please follow me."

A moment later they arrived beside the Yin Pool. Yang Kai looked and found the water shallow—only about three chi deep—but crystal clear to the bottom, without a trace of impurity. The surface was motionless, like a pool of dead water. Yet that very dead water would drive practitioners of yin-evil techniques wild; they would pay any cost to possess such a Yin Pool.

For this Yin Pool's effect on them was immense, rivaling some top-tier heaven-and-earth treasures and rare, precious medicines.

Around the Yin Pool were traces of array formations, likely left when that Liuli Sect senior transported the pool here and used formations to bind its power.

Daiyuan pointed to a spot nearby. "Junior Brother Yang, sit here. I'll cooperate with you in what comes next."

"Very well!" Yang Kai nodded, his figure flickering as he took that position and sat cross-legged.

"There isn't much left to prepare, right?" Daiyuan muttered to herself, looking at the yin-emanating pool with a complicated expression, then suddenly smiled wryly. "Junior Brother Yang, whatever happens, I must thank you. You are the only person in the past twenty-odd years willing to help me, the only friend I've known in the last twenty years."

Saying this, she offered Yang Kai a graceful salute, her expression serious.

Twenty-plus years...

Yang Kai's heart stirred. It seemed Daiyuan's change within Liuli Sect had not only begun a dozen years ago as Wu Yi had discovered, but had started more than twenty years earlier.

Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er should be friends she had known before then and thus did not count among these recent acquaintances.

Yang Kai waved his hand lightly. "Miss Daiyuan, it's nothing; helping you is a small thing. By the way, take this vial of medicinal liquid."

As he spoke, Yang Kai tossed a jade vial over to her.

"This is..." Daiyuan accepted the vial, looking at Yang Kai with suspicion.

"I prepared this medicinal liquid myself. Though I cannot refine the Blood Zhi Pill, if taken with a Blood Zhi Mushroom this liquid can stimulate an extra ten to twenty percent of the mushroom's efficacy; it should help you somewhat. With my current pill-refining skill this is the best I can do," Yang Kai said with slight regret.

Blood Zhi Mushrooms are rare, and Blood Zhi Pills are even harder to concoct. Yet the value of a Blood Zhi Pill is certainly not below Void King-Grade pills—indeed it may surpass them—because a Blood Zhi Pill is a resurrection Saint Pill; for adventuring cultivators who face danger year after year, it is the most valuable of medicines.

Sadly, he could not refine one now and could only use this method so the Blood Zhi Mushroom's potency would not be wasted.

During the past two days he had been preparing this medicinal liquid.

Daiyuan's face lit with joy as she clutched the jade vial tightly without opening it to inspect, and said happily, "Thank you for your trouble, Junior Brother Yang. I will not fail to live up to your hopes."

She felt she had made the right choice in bringing Yang Kai; even if she had summoned Master Xiao from the Sect or the seniors from the Medicine Pill Sect, they might not have produced a liquid capable of invoking that extra portion of the Blood Zhi Mushroom's power.

With this vial, her chance of success at least increased by ten percent—how could she not be delighted?

"Now, Junior Brother Yang, I rely on you!" Daiyuan put the vial away and said gravely to Yang Kai. Before Yang Kai could reply, she suddenly twirled. As she spun, her garments streamed outward in all directions, and in the blink of an eye only her close-fitting undergarments remained.

She had prepared for this moment; the undergarments she wore were black. They outlined her exquisite figure without revealing any indecency.

Even so, her face flushed, and she would not linger. With another movement she dove directly into the Yin Pool.

Not a single splash was thrown. The instant Daiyuan entered the Yin Pool she gave a groan; an expression of extreme pain crossed her face. Stirred by the foreign presence, the pool boiled as if cooked; a white mist arose and, as if possessing intent, spread toward Daiyuan.

Crack, crack...

A crisp sound rang out as a thin layer of ice formed on Daiyuan's delicate body. She merely circulated her technique a little, hot energy surging within, and the thin ice dispersed.

But the white mist pressed on relentlessy, growing in number and ferocity as it crawled over her. Daiyuan could no longer restrain herself and let out a pained scream; a bewildering glow erupted from her body.

The light was extraordinary, as if ten thousand rays bloomed. At the instant the light flared, Yang Kai felt his spirit tighten; his soul was shaken and his Sea of Consciousness trembled slightly. It felt as if invisible shackles had fastened to him, weighing his whole body down.

Glazed Light!

Yang Kai's face showed alarm as he stared unflinchingly at Daiyuan's body.

Although he had long heard from Yang Yan that the Glazed Light emitted by Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain had the power to bind the body and snare the soul, he had not expected it to be so strange—truly difficult to guard against.
