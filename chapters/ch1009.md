## Chapter 1009 — The Old Man Keeps His Word

Yue Xi and her two disciples stared at the ferocious face in the Soul Mirror, twisted by rage, all wearing looks of incredulity.

For it was indeed as He Miao had said: there was a restriction placed by Lü Guichen in Yang Kai’s body, and with his own strength and means he had absolutely no way to undo it. On the entire Floating Continent, only two people could remove that restriction.

One was Yue Xi, whose strength was on par with Lü Guichen; the other was that mysterious old man.

Although the mysterious old man possessed heaven-reaching methods, his temperament was eccentric, and he likely wouldn’t be so kind as to lend a hand. Yue Xi also had not helped Yang Kai remove the restriction.

Then how did he restore his strength?

Moreover, even if he had returned to his peak, he was only at the First Stage of the Saint Realm. How could he possibly be a match for Wei Wu, who was at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm?

“No matter what, Wei Wu was certainly harmed by that brat!” Yue Xi’s pretty face held anger. “Daring to kill someone from my Sword Alliance—I'll make him pay the price!”

“Master, we should look into this first before saying anything.” He Zao hurried to advise.

Yue Xi turned her head and glanced at her, saying coolly, “I know he did you sisters a favor, and we also once misunderstood him, but this brat is indeed somewhat strange. You two needn’t concern yourselves with this. I will handle it.”

Sensing their master’s resolute attitude, the sisters He Zao and He Miao exchanged a glance, both wearing bitter expressions.

Although Wei Wu was their Senior Brother, there wasn’t much affection between them; the sisters even found him rather annoying. So even if Wei Wu was killed, they didn’t particularly care.

It was just that Yang Kai would likely be in trouble now. They worried in secret, unsure how to handle this matter, and couldn’t help but sigh.

Inside the cave, Yang Kai looked as if he had been drenched in fresh blood, his entire body a blood-red hue, a terrifying sight. He stood in place, adjusting his condition, suppressing his own sinister, bloody aura while savoring the exhilaration of his power’s return.

The power regained after loss gave him the illusion of having been reborn.

A tingling numbness came from the gaping wound at his neck. The flesh there seemed to wriggle; under the powerful restorative effect of the Demon God Golden Blood, the torn wound quickly knit back together.

He casually wiped the blood there away. His neck was once more as good as new, with no trace left that he had almost been beheaded just now.

Just as he was staring at Wei Wu’s corpse, preparing to burn it and erase all traces, a strange, mocking laugh suddenly drifted over from the side.

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically. He snapped his head around to look, and saw a figure standing quietly in the darkness.

The glowing strange stone Wei Wu had held earlier had fallen at that figure’s feet. Its radiance illuminated the person’s face clearly.

Upon seeing his features, the strength Yang Kai had just drawn up scattered of its own accord. His expression grew grave, and a bitter taste flooded his heart.

Faced with this person, he had no thought of fighting.

Because the one laughing so oddly was none other than the mysterious old man who originally resided on this continent!

He had been able to severely wound both Lü Guichen and Yue Xi with ease—at the very least, he was a powerhouse of the Origin Returning Realm. Before him, Yang Kai, merely at the First Stage of the Saint Realm, was as insignificant as an ant.

“Senior…” Yang Kai frowned and called out.

He didn’t know when this old fellow had arrived. It seemed he had been standing there all along, flitting like a ghost. A chilling aura that made one uncomfortable emanated from him, and the entire cave became eerie and ghastly.

“Ruthless and decisive. Not bad, not bad!” The old man cackled, and in his eyes there was even a hint of appreciation as he looked Yang Kai over with keen interest. “With cultivation at the First Stage of the Saint Realm, you actually managed to kill head-on an enemy at the Third Stage. Do you have an external power you can borrow?”

Hearing this question, Yang Kai immediately realized that the old man hadn’t seen the clash that had just occurred between him and Wei Wu; otherwise he wouldn’t have asked such a thing.

“Yes.” Yang Kai inclined his head slightly, with no intention of concealing it.

“Seems you’ve had quite a few fortuitous encounters. No wonder you could cultivate to this level at such a young age.” The old man regarded Yang Kai approvingly and nodded in satisfaction. “Good. Truly very good. Your fleshly body is also sturdy, far surpassing those of the same level—about at the Saint King Realm in toughness. And inside you there are two or three powers of different attributes that actually coexist perfectly.”

He nonchalantly laid bare Yang Kai’s background; his eyes seemed able to pierce everything, seeing clearly the capital Yang Kai possessed.

A chill ran through Yang Kai, and his face involuntarily changed.

The old man grinned, revealing a mouthful of white, chilling fangs. “Relax. I won’t seize your belongings. Those trinkets aren’t of much use to this old man. However…”

He abruptly changed his tone, his expression growing sinister. “I said it before, didn’t I? No one is to stir up trouble here. On my turf, your worthless lives belong to me. Whoever dares to strip them away at will—I’ll make them pay the price!”

“He struck first!” Yang Kai argued.

“I don’t care who struck first!” the old man snorted coldly, and tendrils of frigid, pitch-black evil energy suddenly surged out of his body. That evil energy was like incarnations of demons, brimming with a wicked, violent aura. The very instant they appeared, they all leveled their ferocity at Yang Kai and surged toward him.

In a heartbeat, Yang Kai was shrouded by that evil energy, as if he had fallen into a black curtain. All light vanished.

A breath of despair spread out.

Yang Kai trembled all over, unable to help the illusion that he was about to be gnawed clean. It seemed those demonic phantoms could erode his flesh and devour his strength.

He clenched his teeth, kept silent, and resisted with all his might.

The old man’s strange laughter sounded by his ear. “Ten breaths. If you can last ten breaths, I’ll spare you from death! Otherwise, become their meat.”

These words entered Yang Kai’s ears, and his spirit couldn’t help but jolt. Once again he saw a trace of light.

So he pushed his own power even harder, resisting that evil energy invading his body.

As time trickled by, the old man, who watched Yang Kai in silence and examined his condition, couldn’t help but have his eyes light up and his expression change.

He seemed not to have expected that Yang Kai’s body was not only tough, but his will was this tenacious as well.

Even experts like Lü Guichen and Yue Xi, once those demonic phantoms invaded their bodies, might not last ten breaths. Under that vicious aura’s influence, they would lose consciousness, become deranged, and then be gnawed by those phantoms until not a scrap of flesh remained.

But this youth at merely the First Stage of the Saint Realm had been resisting the whole time—resisting with everything, striving to keep his mind clear, not seduced by external forces.

After ten breaths, the old man waved his hand, and those demonic phantoms that had invaded Yang Kai shot out all at once and burrowed back into the old man’s body.

Yang Kai collapsed to the ground like a puddle of mud, drenched in sweat and pale-faced. Yet he still stared firmly at the old man and said urgently, “I hope Senior won’t go back on his word!”

The old man was taken aback, then couldn’t help bursting into wild laughter. The laughter echoed through the cave, sending chills down one’s spine.

“Brat, I must say, that Yang attribute energy in your body is greatly displeasing to this old man, but that other power utterly different from it—I like it very much. Heh heh, looks like you’re also someone on this path. Mm, you get to live. This old man keeps his word.”

Yang Kai let out a heavy breath.

“Did you refine a Pill to undo the restriction on your body?” the old man suddenly asked out of nowhere.

“Yes.” Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the ground, took out a Pill, popped it into his mouth, and began to recover.

“What kinds of pills can you refine?” The old man seemed somewhat interested.

“With my current strength, I can only refine Saint King Grade Lower-Level Pills.”

“Looks like you’ve not only delved into the Martial Dao, you also have quite high attainments in Alchemy.” The old man wore a look of surprise, then grinned and said, “But brat, splitting your focus like this, you might be too busy to manage in the future. Either focus on the Martial Dao, or focus on Alchemy. Otherwise, both paths will end up mediocre, and you’ll regret it.”

“Many thanks for the reminder, Senior. I study Alchemy only as an aid to the Martial Dao.”

“Your future is none of this old man’s concern. I was just speaking casually. Enough nonsense—come with this old man!” As he spoke, he flicked his sleeve, and a film-like power precisely enveloped Yang Kai.

In the next moment, Yang Kai felt himself shoot forward like lightning.

That speed was even swifter than driving a Star Shuttle, which made Yang Kai’s expression change slightly despite himself. He truly didn’t know how unfathomably deep this mysterious old man’s cultivation was.

Before long, the old man suddenly came to a stop, set Yang Kai down, and instructed, “Wait here. Don’t wander around.”

Yang Kai looked left and right and discovered that this was the mountainside of the peak where the old man resided.

There was a large stretch of flat ground at the mountainside, and at its very center rows upon rows of Saint Crystals were arranged in a peculiar fashion, converging into a strange grand formation.

At the very center of the formation stood a bronze-colored great door. The frame and base of that door were inlaid with a great many Saint Crystals of extremely high grade.

The whole mountainside was suffused with Spiritual Qi; mists condensed from energy filled the sky above, making the place look like a fairyland.

The old man, as grim as a ferocious ghost, was utterly out of place with such scenery.

Yang Kai remained silent, not uttering a word, sitting quietly where he was. While restoring himself, he observed his surroundings.

He didn’t understand why the old man had brought him here, but in associating with such a moody and eccentric expert, the pressure on Yang Kai was like a mountain. He didn’t dare make any strange moves, lest he arouse a misunderstanding.

The old man bustled about within the formation, from time to time adjusting the positions of the Saint Crystals and the structure of the array.

Before long, streaks of azure rainbow light suddenly shot in from all directions.

They were cultivators of Purple Star and the Sword Alliance driving Star Shuttles as they approached this place.

With tacit understanding, everyone gathered on this flat ground at the mountainside, each landing with big and small bundles on their backs, seeking out spots of their own, whispering in twos and threes.

They had clearly dared to come here only because they had been summoned by the old man, yet judging by their bewildered expressions, they obviously didn’t know why he had called them.

A moment later, three graceful figures descended from the side—it was the Sword Alliance’s Yue Xi and the sisters He Zao and He Miao.

The moment Yue Xi arrived, her phoenix eyes swept across the surroundings and instantly locked onto Yang Kai. Her delicate face brimmed with anger as she strode swiftly toward him.
