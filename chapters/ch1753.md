## Chapter 1753 — Experts Like Clouds

"Trade?" Yang Kai furrowed his brow. "What trade?"

"You didn't really forget, did you?" Xue Yue looked at him, her lips curling into a sneer. "So that's it — it seems back then you were too busy flirting with that enchantress of Di Chen to remember what I said."

Yang Kai pursed his lips. "Why do I smell a trace of sourness..."

"Stop twisting things!" Xue Yue snapped indignantly.

"But how do you know she belonged to Di Chen? Did you later probe into her background?" Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at her.

"So what if I did?" Xue Yue lifted her chin slightly and snorted coldly. "A shameless enchantress like that — if she didn't come from Di Chen, where else would she come from?"

"So you really did investigate..." Yang Kai muttered to himself. "Never mind, don't bring that up — I remember the trade you mentioned."

"Good that you remember. Where is that thing?"

"You mean the thing inside that stele?"

"Exactly!"

Yang Kai frowned slightly; of course he remembered the scene back then and the bargain he had struck with Xue Yue. She had said that if he handed over the stone plaque from the stele, their enmity would be wiped clean and she would never trouble him again.

At the time Yang Kai had agreed, but before he could hand the plaque to Xue Yue, the Imperial Garden had closed without warning, and the deal had fallen through.

Later Yang Kai learned that hidden within that plaque was a world-shattering secret technique — the Star Refining Technique.

It was an unsurpassed method to refine the Stellar Origin of a star and make a martial artist into a Star Lord. Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang's ability to refine the Tongxuan Continent's origin into power at the Saint King Realm owed not only to the continent's waning state, but also greatly to the Star Refining Technique.

Otherwise, given Xia Ningshang's cultivation at the time, she might not have been able to successfully refine the origin power and become a Star Lord.

There was no doubt it was a secret technique capable of alarming an entire Star Domain and sending powerful experts into bloody conflict; its value was incalculable.

It would have been one thing not to know the existence of the Star Refining Technique, but now that Yang Kai knew, he naturally could not hand it over lightly, even to Xue Yue.

The relationship between the two of them remained tangled. How could Yang Kai casually entrust such a technique to her?

"Do you know what is recorded on that plaque?" Yang Kai countered.

"I don't know!" Xue Yue shook her head.

"You don't know and yet you want it?"

"Although I don't know exactly what it records, I know it is the key for my father to ascend to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, so I must have it!" Xue Yue said resolutely.

"Chairman Ai Ou?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

Xue Yue's father was, of course, Ai Ou, the chairman of the Hengluo Commerce Guild. Yang Kai had heard much about this figure renowned across the Star Domain, though he had never met him. He knew Ai Ou was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, but had been unable to break past the barrier to the Third Stage. Even so, with the Hengluo Commerce Guild backing him, Ai Ou was not to be underestimated.

"Yes, so I hope you can give me that plaque so I can hand it to my father!" Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai earnestly.

"How can you be sure what is recorded in there will let your father reach the Third Stage? You don't even know what it is for."

Xue Yue smiled. "Our Hengluo Commerce Guild has handed down information for so many years; there are things outsiders don't know. That's not something I need to tell you."

Yang Kai nodded and fell into thought.

In a certain sense, what Xue Yue said wasn’t wrong. The Star Refining Technique might truly be the key for Ai Ou to advance to the Third Stage. After all, with Ai Ou’s status and foundation as a veteran Void King Realm master, if he combined it with the Star Refining Technique, it might not be impossible for him to refine the Stellar Origin of a Cultivation Star. Once successful, with the resonance and nourishment from that Stellar Origin, he would surely be able to break through and advance smoothly.

Of course, there would inevitably be unavoidable risks — it might well end in the destruction of his soul.

Realizing that, Yang Kai was secretly surprised at the intelligence the Hengluo Commerce Guild possessed. The Star Refining Technique had been sealed within a stele deep in the Imperial Garden; before the stele was shattered Yang Kai had not detected anything inside, yet the Hengluo Commerce Guild had known of it in advance.

“I hope you can give that thing to me!” Xue Yue looked earnestly at Yang Kai. “Even if it’s just a copy, that’s fine. The stone tablet must record some kind of secret technique, right? I don’t need the tablet itself—just make a copy of its contents for me.”

"I'll have to consider that," Yang Kai said after a moment's thought.

"No problem," Xue Yue agreed readily, "but before that, you must act with me."

Yang Kai chuckled. "With Ni Guang here, I don't think I can easily get away from you."

"Who knows — you're a slippery one; if we aren't careful you might run off," Xue Yue sniffed. "That's why I had Uncle Ni invite you."

That was Xue Yue's main purpose in having Ni Guang bring Yang Kai along! The moment she saw Yang Kai arrive here, she knew the task she had left unfinished long ago had a chance of being completed.

"Since it's agreed, let's go back for now. The entrance may open before long; once we're inside, don't run off." Xue Yue warned anxiously.

"Understood."

Before long the two returned near the entrance; Ni Guang was still meditating with his eyes closed, and Luo Lan stood quietly nearby. When the two reappeared, Luo Lan gave a slight nod and did not ask further questions.

"Xue Yue." Yang Kai suddenly leaned close and called softly.

"What?" Xue Yue became inexplicably nervous and frowned. "Can you not stand so close?"

Yang Kai looked at her strangely, then said, "Who are the people here — do you know them?"

Xue Yue replied, "Some I know, some I don't."

"Then this person... do you know him?" Yang Kai said as he gave a subtle signal in one direction.

Xue Yue glanced that way and saw a Void King Realm expert surrounded entirely by a mass of black qi, his face impossible to make out. The black qi twisted like a living thing, giving off a most unsettling aura that made one shudder.

"I haven't seen him, nor heard of him," Xue Yue whispered, shivering. "What's wrong? Does he have some issue?"

"I don't know if it's my impression, but he seems very interested in me," Yang Kai frowned.

Xue Yue was astonished; she would not think Yang Kai was being fanciful. His strength was not weak; if someone truly paid attention to him, he would sense it. If he said so, then the figure enveloped in black qi was certainly focusing on him.

As if to confirm Yang Kai's words, when Xue Yue secretly watched the figure, a shrill, mocking laugh came from within the black qi — an ear-piercing sound.

Xue Yue's face went pale.

"This person is dangerous — don't provoke him," Ni Guang opened his eyes and said solemnly.

"Uncle Ni, who is he?" Xue Yue asked.

"I don't know," Ni Guang shook his head. "Among the Void King Realm experts I know, none match him. Yet... I can feel he is very strong; perhaps not below me."

"So does that mean he's at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm?"

"I can't determine whether he's at the Second Stage unless we cross blades," Ni Guang said slowly. "In any case, don't provoke him — his aura is evil; he likely cultivates some shadowy, sinister art."

"Understood," Xue Yue nodded obediently.

To prevent Yang Kai from drawing the attention of the wrong people, Xue Yue carefully introduced the origins and identities of the Void King Realm experts present. There were over ten people here; Xue Yue recognized about eighty percent, and could make guesses about the remaining two or three she did not know.

Yang Kai committed the faces and identities of these people to memory for future reference.

Outside the entrance, everyone waited in silence.

From time to time new Void King Realm cultivators arrived, found a spot, and closed their eyes to meditate.

About three days later, a brilliant streak of light appeared in the distant starry sky, glowing with a purple radiance so dazzling it was blinding.

At the sight of the purple light, Ni Guang abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze deep as he looked toward the source of the glow and snorted, "That old dog actually came..."

He seemed to recognize the arriving figure at a glance.

"But it's fine — his arrival means we are nearly ready," Ni Guang added.

The aura contained within the purple escape-light was extremely powerful, not in the least inferior to Ni Guang's; the newcomer must be a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert. Upon sensing this, the First Stage Void King cultivators who had arrived earlier all changed color slightly. Only the figure wrapped in black qi continued its eerie laughter, unconcerned; the laugh sent chills down one's spine.

In a moment the purple light approached the group and, when the radiance dissipated, it revealed two figures inside.

Both were broad-shouldered and robust, as if carved from the same mold, each with long hair suffused with purple falling over their shoulders, looking free and unbound.

The two looked like brothers.

But on closer inspection it was clear they were not; their cultivations differed greatly. One was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, while the other was only at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the same realm as Xue Yue and Yang Kai.

After they revealed themselves the two swept their gazes around, and their attention turned to the Hengluo Commerce Guild's side.

Ni Guang and the Second Stage Void King looked each other in the eye...

Xue Yue's gaze met that of the Third Stage Origin Returning cultivator...

Neither side showed weakness nor retreated; each wore an expression of calm indifference.

"Hahaha!" A thunderous laugh rang out as the purple-haired Second Stage Void King laughed heartily, appearing very bold and convivial. "Sorry to keep you waiting, old fellows, I'm a bit late."

"Nobody's waiting for you. Zi Long, you still love to act so melodramatic!" Ni Guang sneered.

"Oh? I thought Brother Ni was just eager for my arrival." Zi Long chuckled.
