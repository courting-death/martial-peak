## Chapter 1214 — Wei Guchang's Plea for Help

Moreover, within my Black Book Space there is a Divine Tree currently slumbering; perhaps the Divine Tree’s aura can nourish this Golden Sun Fruit tree.

Of course, even if it fails, there’s no great loss.

“What do you want this fruit tree for?” The woman halted her steps and looked at Yang Kai strangely. “This spirit tree has very strict requirements for its growing environment; if you take it away from here it might die, and a Spatial Ring isn’t suitable for storing something like this.”

After saying a few words, she suddenly realized she might be meddling and gave an embarrassed smile, then offered, “Do you want me to help?”

“No need, I appreciate your kindness, but I can handle it myself.” Yang Kai smiled faintly, extended a finger, Saint Yuan burst forth and condensed into a blade-like energy at his fingertip, then he stabbed into the ground and circled the Golden Sun Fruit tree.

The soil around the tree wasn’t very firm, so Yang Kai easily cut it away. To avoid damaging the roots and rhizomes of the Golden Sun Fruit tree, he was careful, his Divine Sense covering beneath it to guide his Saint Yuan away from where the roots lay.

After circling once, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and formed it into a large net that enveloped the whole Golden Sun Fruit tree.

In the next moment a light flashed, and the three zhang-tall Golden Sun Fruit tree vanished from the field, having been stored into Yang Kai’s Black Book Space and placed beside the Divine Tree, leaving behind only a huge, deep pit.

A trace of surprise flickered in the woman’s eyes. Although with her cultivation she could store such a spirit tree into her Spatial Ring, Yang Kai—a First Stage of the Saint King Realm—had done it without changing color or breathing hard, which was somewhat astonishing.

After all, taking in such a massive living thing still puts some burden on one’s Divine Sense.

Having stored the Golden Sun Fruit tree, Yang Kai gave the woman a faint smile and was about to part ways when his brow knit; he brushed his finger across his ring and withdrew a Transmission Compass.

Just now, as his Divine Sense had casually swept over his Spatial Ring, he had suddenly detected some fluctuation of messages emanating from the compass, which immediately caught his attention.

This communication compass was given to him by Wei Guchang. Not long after entering the Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai had found the corpses of two Yingyue Hall disciples; he had tried to contact Wei Guchang then but received no reply. He didn’t know how that man or Xuan’er were faring. Now, more than a month later, the compass suddenly registered activity, which surprised him greatly.

Yang Kai hadn’t yet checked the message when the woman standing beside him made a soft exclamation and, staring at him in astonishment, asked, “Are you a disciple of Yingyue Hall?”

Yang Kai looked up at her with a puzzled face. “Why would you say that?”

Although he had fairly close dealings with the people of Yingyue Hall, he wasn’t truly one of them. Now that he had merely taken out a Transmission Compass, how could this woman harbor such suspicions?

The woman smiled faintly and pointed at the compass in Yang Kai’s hand. “This treasure was forged by Master Gelin of Yingyue Hall; it bears his unique mark. I also have a treasure made by Master Gelin, so I recognize it. Who would possess such a Transmission Compass if not someone from Yingyue Hall? Moreover, only the Hall’s core disciples would own such a compass.”

For some reason, after suspecting Yang Kai of being a Yingyue Hall disciple, the woman’s attitude toward him improved; their previous awkwardness melted away and she spoke naturally.

Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment, glanced where she pointed, and indeed found a triangular emblem on the side of the compass.

He had heard of Master Gelin—said to be the only Origin-Grade, Lower-Level artificer in Yingyue Hall and one of the few masters on Dark Star. It seemed the triangle mark was Master Gelin’s symbol.

Such things were quite normal. Generally, any well-known artificer would have a unique mark of their own. After refining a Secret Treasure, they would imprint that mark upon it—not only to increase its value, but also to bring greater prestige to the one who wielded it.

Alchemists didn’t do that—who would stamp pills with a mark when pills are swallowed in one gulp? There’s nothing to show off before you eat them.

The woman’s observation was indeed careful; Yang Kai had not noticed the mark before.

Nodding, he said, “It should indeed be forged by Master Gelin, but I am not a Yingyue Hall disciple—Wei Guchang gave it to me.”

“Senior Brother Wei gave it to you?” The woman covered her mouth, surprised. She knew well of Wei Guchang’s pride; even among Yingyue Hall’s core disciples he looked down on them, and aside from Xuan’er, none had earned his favor. That Wei Guchang would give Yang Kai a Transmission Compass meant something significant.

“You know Brother Wei?” This time, it was Yang Kai’s turn to be surprised. He hadn’t expected that this woman he’d met by chance would actually have some connection to Wei Guchang.

“Yes, I do. I’m quite close to Xuan’er…” The woman smiled, then her expression changed slightly as if recalling something, and she hastily asked, “Did Senior Brother Wei send a message? Check quickly!”

Anyone capable of sending a message from within this place could only be one of Yingyue Hall’s most core disciples—no one else. It was highly likely that the transmission came from Wei Guchang himself, and if he was reaching out to others, it could only mean he had fallen into some kind of danger.

Wei Guchang and Xuan’er were always together; if Wei Guchang were in peril then Xuan’er would certainly not escape it, and thinking of this made the woman frantic as she urged Yang Kai on.

The woman’s anxious demeanor astonished Yang Kai; he wondered what background she had to be so familiar with Xuan’er. Seeing her worry, it was clear their relationship ran deep.

Without hesitation he poured Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass to probe it, while the woman anxiously fixed her beautiful eyes on Yang Kai.

A moment later, Yang Kai frowned slightly. Lifting his head to glance at her, he said, “It’s a message from Brother Wei. From the looks of it, he and his group seem to have run into some trouble.”

“What happened?” the woman asked urgently.

“They seem to have fallen into an ancient sealing formation and are temporarily trapped, and only Brother Wei’s transmission reaches me—when I tried to reply there was no response. It’s very strange.” Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

“An ancient sealing formation?” The woman’s face went pale. “Is Xuan’er all right?”

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai shook his head. “Only Brother Wei’s message came through—there were no traces of anyone else’s Divine Sense.”

Hearing this, the woman’s expression cleared somewhat, perhaps consoling herself. She murmured, “Then Xuan’er should be with Senior Brother Wei, which is why only Senior Brother Wei is sending a message. Do you know their location?”

Yang Kai shook his head again. “Brother Wei hasn’t reported their precise coordinates yet. Wait a bit—if he’s truly asking for help he’ll reveal his location, and since I can receive his transmission, he shouldn’t be too far.”

If he were too far away, his Divine Sense transmission couldn’t reach here.

“Okay!” The woman slightly nodded, though she understood Yang Kai’s reasoning, her soft hands still clenched into fists as she anxiously stared at the Transmission Compass in his hand.

Yang Kai was now certain the woman was indeed close to Xuan’er—otherwise she wouldn’t be so agitated. As he examined her, her gaze met his and, sensing she had lost a little composure, she gave an embarrassed smile.

“Got it!” Yang Kai suddenly exclaimed. As he had suspected, Wei Guchang did report his location. After feeling carefully for a moment, Yang Kai looked up and asked the woman, “They are located one hundred li west of a massive Gangyin Ore stone… a massive Gangyin ore stone?”

“Gangyin ore stone?” The woman’s face lit up. “I know where that is—I happened to pass by it once.”

“Lead the way!” Yang Kai was decisive; he immediately put away the Transmission Compass and signaled to the woman.

The woman nodded, launched into motion and ran ahead, with Yang Kai close behind.

They traveled without speaking and encountered no danger or a single soul. About half a day later a gigantic ore stone, over a hundred zhang high, loomed before them. It stood alone on the crimson earth like a small mountain, as if untouched since ancient times, giving a desolate, bleak impression.

Seeing the huge ore stone, Yang Kai couldn’t help raising an eyebrow.

Previously he had considered taking some Gangyin; it was excellent material for forging treasures—mix a bit of it into a Secret Treasure during its creation and the item would become incredibly durable, so in fights it wouldn’t be broken. Its value was immense; a handful of Gangyin sand could easily fetch tens of thousands of Saint Crystals, and it was a rare, highly sought-after material.

But seeing such an enormous Gangyin orestone now, Yang Kai immediately lost interest.

He couldn’t possibly take it into his Black Book Space.

If it had been some other ore he might have considered chipping off a piece, but Gangyin was too tough; it required Saint Yuan to melt it to extract Gangyin sand, which wasn’t a day’s work.

If only he had brought the Stone Puppet; unfortunately the Stone Puppet had been left behind by Yang Yan before departure, so thinking about it now was pointless. Yang Kai reluctantly stared at the giant Gangyin orestone, then calmly turned his gaze away.

“This is it.” The woman pointed ahead.

Yang Kai nodded. “One hundred li to the west!”

Saying so, he produced his Yuan Magnetic Pointer to confirm the direction and led the way.
