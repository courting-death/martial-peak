## Chapter 295 — What Place Is This

Before long, Yang Kai's eyes brightened as he had left the Void Passage.

In the next moment, Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman appeared not far from him. The two women, having suddenly arrived in this unfamiliar Realm, looked around in confusion, momentarily forgetting to take action against Yang Kai.

Swish... Another figure materialized. When the three of them saw who it was, an involuntary chill ran down their spines.

This person was a family expert brought by Qiu Yimeng, possessing the strength of the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

However, at this moment, only half of his body had been transmitted out, with the other half lost to an unknown location, as if a supreme expert had cleaved him in two with a single sword strike, the cut perfectly clean.

As his body fell, his internal organs scattered across the ground, blood splattering everywhere, presenting a gruesome sight.

"What...?" Qiu Yimeng's beautiful eyes trembled violently, staring in disbelief at the scene, while Luo Xiaoman turned pale, nearly retching, covering her mouth as she moved closer to Qiu Yimeng.

"Did you do this?" Qiu Yimeng suddenly looked up, her expression cold as she glared at Yang Kai, her True Essence gradually becoming unsettled.

She was unaware of the mysteries of the Void Passage and assumed that Yang Kai had set some trap in that chaotic place, which allowed him to slay this expert from her family, naturally inciting her fury.

A Fifth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert was not easy for the Qiu Family to cultivate, and now he had died in such a muddled manner.

Yang Kai ignored her and instead surveyed his surroundings with a gloomy expression.

Aside from himself and the two women opposite him, there were no other traces of people nearby. Not to mention the Senior Aunt and Senior Brothers from the Lingxiao Pavilion who had left the Void Passage earlier, even Su Yan, who had gone ahead of him, was nowhere to be found.

Moreover, this place was entirely unfamiliar and was not where Yang Kai had landed during his last crossing of the void with Ling Taixu.

Releasing his Divine Sense, he meticulously explored everything within a twenty-mile radius. After a moment, Yang Kai's heart sank to the depths!

There were indeed people within this twenty-mile radius. However, they were not from the Lingxiao Pavilion but rather experts from the True Essence Realm and Divine Roaming Realm brought by the two women opposite him. He had no idea what had happened. They had emerged from the Void Passage at a location somewhat distant from here, scattered around in disarray. There were not many of them, probably only a dozen or so, among which only two or three were Divine Roaming Realm experts.

Was it because of the fierce battle in the Void Passage just now? Yang Kai pondered with a grim expression.

That was the only possibility; the collision of True Essence in the Void Passage had caused it to collapse, transporting those inside to this unfamiliar land.

And the half corpse on the ground was likely the result of a portion of his body being severed in the Void Passage.

That was close! Thinking of this, Yang Kai couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.

It seemed that crossing the void was not something to be taken lightly; a moment's carelessness could lead to being obliterated without a chance to resist.

However, Su Yan should have safely joined the others from the Lingxiao Pavilion, as she was ahead of him. With this thought, Yang Kai secretly let out a breath.

"Hey, I'm asking you a question." Luo Xiaoman's face was somewhat pale. Seeing Yang Kai standing there nonchalantly, she couldn't help but feel disgusted.

A disciple from a small Sect. How arrogant! Even if he had some means, they were quite limited. Qiu Yimeng, with her beauty and fame, would not even bother to respond to the young masters from the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu. Now that Qiu Yimeng was taking the initiative to speak to him, he remained silent, showing no respect.

Yang Kai's expression darkened as he glanced at the two women opposite him, a hint of coldness flashing in his eyes.

If it weren't for their sudden appearance obstructing him, he and Su Yan would have already been thousands of miles away.

Having just agreed to travel the world together with her, he was now separated by their appearance, not knowing where to search for Su Yan. Yang Kai's frustration was palpable.

"What place is this?" Qiu Yimeng raised her delicate brows, standing there with an air of nonchalance, her beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai as she softly inquired.

She was tall and slender, with long legs and a slim waist, her face exquisitely beautiful. Especially her waist, which was tightly bound by a purple corset, barely able to be grasped by a single hand, evoking endless fantasies.

Moreover, as the young lady of the Qiu Family in Zhongdu, her demeanor was even more noble and proud. Young men of her age would feel a subtle pressure when they saw her, not daring to show any disrespect.

The questions she asked were always expected to have answers.

Yang Kai revealed a hint of disdain and impatience, sneering, "What place? How would I know what this place is?"

His crude words caused both women to momentarily freeze.

Luo Xiaoman's face turned pale with anger, her delicate chest trembling as she gritted her teeth and scolded, "You little brat, dare you speak to us like that!"

A mocking smile surfaced on Qiu Yimeng's radiant face, calm and unhurried, as she chuckled, "Interesting, no man has ever insulted me before; you are the first. If you don’t want to answer, that’s fine. Once I capture you, I will slowly pry it out of you."

She naturally believed that all of this was orchestrated by Yang Kai, unaware that he truly had no idea where they were.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, stepping forward as his True Essence surged. In the next moment, his self-created footwork unfolded, leaving a residual shadow in place as he rapidly approached the two women.

He sensed that the three Divine Roaming Realm experts nearby had already discovered Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman's presence and were quickly rushing over. Thus, Yang Kai had to capture one of them as leverage; otherwise, being surrounded alone by those Divine Roaming Realm experts would mean certain doom.

Seeing him act so boldly, Luo Xiaoman shouted, "You’re asking for a beating!"

Circles of blue light suddenly erupted from her delicate body, each ring containing a nimble and soft force that both hindered Yang Kai's speed and invaded his body.

Yang Kai's momentum did not diminish; he fiercely urged his True Essence. Luo Xiaoman's technique could not stop his advance. As he charged forward like a shooting star, Luo Xiaoman's expression finally changed slightly.

"Be careful!" Qiu Yimeng quickly called out, raising her delicate hand, not knowing what technique she had unleashed, while swiftly pulling Luo Xiaoman back.

Yang Kai's steps suddenly halted as he punched fiercely to the side, his True Essence exploding in the void, producing a violent sound.

The rebounding force caused Yang Kai's body to tremble slightly. Before he could react, Qiu Yimeng suddenly giggled, her delicate figure resembling a floating leaf, her feet lightly stepping in the void, seemingly leaving no trace but rapidly closing in on Yang Kai.

This was an exceptionally refined footwork technique. As it unfolded, Qiu Yimeng appeared both real and illusory, completely untraceable.

Yang Kai's expression grew serious. He extended his Divine Sense, instantly discerning Qiu Yimeng's hiding place, and unleashed the Triple Flame Yang Explosion.

Qiu Yimeng suddenly revealed herself, a hint of astonishment flashing across her beautiful face, as her True Essence surged violently.

With a muffled grunt, Yang Kai was forced to retreat several steps, while Qiu Yimeng remained calm, a serene smile on her face as she looked Yang Kai up and down, leisurely saying, "You have some skill, but it’s nothing much. If this is all you can do, I advise you to surrender obediently; otherwise, I won’t show mercy."

Difficult to deal with!

Listening to her speak so confidently, Yang Kai's face darkened. He had intended to capture Luo Xiaoman as a hostage, but this young lady from the Qiu Family was indeed no easy opponent. If he were to unleash all his strength, he should be able to defeat her, but he certainly couldn't do that in a short time.

The three Divine Roaming Realm experts on the opposing side were rapidly closing in, leaving Yang Kai with little opportunity.

"You want to leave?" Qiu Yimeng's beautiful eyes suddenly sparkled with pride and cunning, seeing through Yang Kai's thoughts. Without waiting for him to respond, she lunged forward, "With me here, where do you think you're going?"

"Get lost!" Yang Kai shouted angrily, pushing forward with both palms, unleashing the White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal simultaneously.

With a roar of the tiger and a bellow of the ox, two fiery red Demonic Beasts sprang forth, baring their fangs and lunging at Qiu Yimeng.

Instead of being alarmed, Qiu Yimeng was delighted, her smile bright: "You really have some skill; no wonder Bai Yunfeng lost to you!"

As she spoke, her delicate hands began to wave, and visible streams of True Essence surged forth, transforming into massive hands that descended from the sky.

Before the two beast souls could reach Qiu Yimeng, they were already dispersed.

Yang Kai grinned savagely, the Shura Sword gripped tightly in his hand, his True Yang Yuan Qi retreating into his Dantian, and the evil energy from his Proud Bone Golden Body erupted completely.

A skyward surge of malevolent energy descended, enveloping Yang Kai in a shroud of black mist, with only his pair of scarlet eyes emitting a chilling glow.

With the Shura Sword in hand, Yang Kai seemed to transform into a different person.

Sensing the surging aura of evil, Qiu Yimeng's expression changed drastically as she exclaimed, "The Lingxiao Pavilion indeed possesses evil techniques!"

As she spoke, she pointed forward, conjuring a massive lightning ball at her fingertip, which she hurled at Yang Kai in an instant, the crackling arcs of electricity exploding with terrifying power.

Yang Kai swung his sword to strike.

With a single sweep, the lightning ball shattered, and the tiny electric arcs danced like spirit serpents, enveloping the area within several dozen zhang.

Qiu Yimeng retreated rapidly, no longer daring to underestimate him, her expression extremely grave.

Yang Kai moved through the world of arcs, the flickering lightning unable to hinder him in the slightest. He quickened his pace, instantly closing in on Qiu Yimeng, striking down from above.

Sensing the murderous intent and evil within, Qiu Yimeng's face paled as she called out, "Stop!"

A quaint shield suddenly appeared in her small hand, glowing with a misty light, enveloping her within.

This was clearly a defensive treasure, and given the Qiu Family's wealth, its quality was undoubtedly high.

With a clang, the Shura Sword struck the shield, and their True Essence violently collided, whipping up a gale at the location.

With a soft grunt, Qiu Yimeng was forced back several dozen zhang, her delicate body swaying. In this exchange, she had clearly suffered a slight loss.

Gritting her teeth, she glanced at the shield in her hand, and Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly, "You do have some means, but as a mere Third Stage True Essence Realm cultivator, you’ve managed to make me feel so embarrassed. It seems I underestimated you!"
