## Chapter 1837 — Yang Yan Leaves

Wu Shengfeng's eyes nearly popped out: "You know my Sect Master?"

The Yu Heling that Yang Yan mentioned was none other than the Sect Master of the Falling Star Sect. At this, Wu Shengfeng truly began to panic. This mysterious woman spoke with an arrogance that reached the heavens, and her cultivation was unfathomably deep—most likely… she was someone he absolutely could not afford to provoke.

His previous air of superiority evaporated in an instant. Wu Shengfeng's face shifted wildly as cold sweat began to bead on his forehead.

"I'll give you three breaths' time; if you don't satisfy me, I'll take matters into my own hands," Yang Yan said, raising a pale, slender finger as she counted aloud, "One!"

Her countdown came out low and heavy, and an intensely repressive atmosphere descended. Wu Shengfeng panicked and blurted, "Wait, let's talk this out!"

"Two..." Yang Yan remained unmoved.

"Don't push me too far! My Luo Xing Sect is not to be trifled with — even if your strength surpasses mine, so what? I've already investigated: there is no guardian in this Star Domain. What business have you meddling like this?"

"Three!" Yang Yan let a single note slip from her mouth, then suddenly blurred and appeared directly before Wu Shengfeng.

"Smack..." No one saw exactly what happened; only a crisp, clear sound rang out, and Wu Shengfeng was sent spinning through the air, half his face swelling up in an instant.

"You dare hit me?" Wu Shengfeng shouted, his tone full of agonized indignation.

"Smack..." Barely steady on his feet, Wu Shengfeng was sent flying again, the right side of his face beginning to swell.

"Bitch, don't think I fear you. I'm only holding back because you're a woman..."

"Smack..."

"Enough!"

"Smack..."

"If you beat someone, don't strike the face..."

"Smack..."

"Young lady, leave me a way out so we can meet again someday!"

"Smack..."

"Please, senior, spare me..."

"Smack..."

"Wah... I was wrong, senior, I was wrong, I admit defeat, stop, please stop..."

From ten thousand li away, Sha Hu and Lie Kong in the sea's depths stared dumbfounded; even Yang Kai and Lin Yun'er gaped, staring up at that absurd scene in the sky.

The once high and mighty Wu Shengfeng, that near-invincible powerhouse who could sweep aside all opposition, now stood before Yang Yan like a three-year-old child—utterly powerless to resist. No matter how he tried to dodge, every single time Yang Yan’s strike landed squarely and mercilessly upon him.

The crisp smacks reached everyone's ears; as they listened to Wu Shengfeng's struggles and pleas, they felt both exhilarated and strangely moved.

Yang Kai swallowed, then nudged Lin Yun'er and asked softly, "Girl, has your Senior Aunt been in a bad mood lately?"

Lin Yun'er nodded her head like a little chick pecking grain, looking timid, "Senior Aunt has been speaking less recently; she hasn't seemed in good spirits."

"Poor thing," Yang Kai sighed softly.

In midair, Wu Shengfeng's face had been slapped into a grotesque mask, as if stung by countless venomous bees — utterly ridiculous; all his momentum vanished. He hung his head and stood obediently before Yang Yan, motionless, resigned to his fate.

Yang Yan looked at him coolly and said, "Originally, since you dared violate the Star Realm's prohibition, I intended to take your life."

Wu Shengfeng trembled at her words, staring at Yang Yan in terror. He forced out a smile more pitiable than tears, fawning with clasped hands and slurred words, "Senior... please show mercy. It's my first time coming to a lower Star Domain; forgive my first offense, I beg you to spare my life."

“Hmph!” Yang Yan snorted coldly. “If not for that, do you think you’d still be alive? You can be spared, but your sins cannot be forgiven. You will follow me back to the Star Realm and stand guard at the Star Gate for three thousand years to atone for your crimes!”

"Three... three thousand years?" Wu Shengfeng cried in disbelief.

Guarding a Star Gate for three thousand years was not only unbearably dull, but the prohibitive power near the gate prevented cultivation; if he wasted three thousand years, what future would he have left?

"Any objections?" Yang Yan asked coldly, looking him in the eye.

"N-no!" Wu Shengfeng hurriedly shook his head. "I dare not disobey your command, Senior. It is my honor — ha, ha..."

"Don't think I don't know what you're thinking," Yang Yan sneered. "You reckon that once back in the Star Realm your master Yu Heling will step in and have you hauled back, do you? If he dares to intervene, I'll send him to guard the Star Gate for three thousand years too!"

Wu Shengfeng's eyes widened in horror. He blurted, "Senior, who exactly are you—what sort of divine being are you?"

Their own Sect Master Yu Heling was a notable figure in the Star Realm, but from this woman's tone it was clear she did not regard the Sect Master at all.

In the entire Star Domain, the number of people qualified to speak so was likely no more than fifty; apart from the top ten experts, the rest were Emperor-level figures.

"Can you even ask who I am?" Yang Yan snorted, and with a wave of her hand a palace-shaped secret treasure appeared. She formed a hand sign at Wu Shengfeng and ordered, "Go inside!"

The next moment, a force bound Wu Shengfeng and, without consent, drove him toward the palace-like treasure.

"The Imperial Garden!" Wu Shengfeng cried out when he saw the palace-shaped treasure. "So you are—"

He didn't finish; his body was swallowed by the treasure.

Yang Kai squinted at the palace-shaped treasure and recognized it: it was the Imperial Garden that had floated above Lingxiao Sect, and with Yang Yan's awakening the Imperial Garden had been reclaimed by her.

Wu Shengfeng had been easily subdued, yet Sha Hu, Lie Kong and the others dared not step forward to thank her; instead they wore solemn expressions. They understood that cultivators of this level were not people they could approach — what they had witnessed went beyond the annals of Dark Star's recorded history.

Perhaps this day's battle would become one more legend written into history.

In midair, Yang Kai stared at Yang Yan and suddenly felt as if she stood higher than the sky itself; he had to crane his neck to glimpse her vague silhouette, and the feeling left him oddly unsettled.

Yang Yan said nothing; she merely stood silently and watched Yang Kai.

After a long moment she finally spoke, "I should go."

"Return to the Star Realm?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

"Correct." Yang Yan nodded. "I have my own Star Domain to guard; I haven't checked on it in tens of thousands of years and don't know whether anyone has invaded it. My being here was an accident."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, indicating he understood.

"If you want to go to the Star Realm, those nine Star Emperor Tokens are the key. When I came here I severed the link between this Star Domain and the Star Gate; only those nine Star Emperor Tokens can reopen it. If you want your family and friends to live in peace, pursue a higher Martial Dao — otherwise another like Wu Shengfeng will come, and you won't be able to resist." Yang Yan said as she flicked a finger; a speck of light like a firefly shot toward Yang Kai. "This is the method to open the passage. Whether you go or stay is your decision."

Yang Kai stood motionless as the firefly-like light entered his Sea of Consciousness; in the next moment he felt new things added to his thoughts.

Yang Yan waved her hand again, and Lin Yun'er, who had stood beside Yang Kai, gave a small cry as she was drawn toward Yang Yan and taken by her.

"Yun'er has an extraordinary talent and suits a friend's inheritance; I will take her with me," Yang Yan said, looking deeply at Yang Kai before flicking her body and vanishing from his sight.

"I hope we meet again in the Star Realm!" Yang Yan's departing voice echoed in the air.

Yang Kai opened his mouth but only sighed, standing there with a sense of loss.

Calm returned to Wuyou Sea.

After a long time, Sha Hu and Lie Kong cautiously flew up to Yang Kai. The former kept glancing around and asked in a trembling voice, "Yang Kai, that senior... she—"

"Don't ask, and don't think too much. I have nothing to say," Yang Kai waved a hand.

"Oh." Sha Hu bowed his head, realizing he had asked an improper question.

Yang Kai glanced at Palace Master Lie Kong and said, “If Palace Master Lie Kong has the time, pay a visit to the Lingxiao Sect. Have my Little Senior Sister refine a Heavenly Restoration Pill for you— it should be able to restore your severed limb.”

Lie Kong's eyes bulged with joy, and he bowed repeatedly, "Thank you, Star Lord! Lie Kong is deeply grateful; the Sea God Palace will henceforth follow the Star Lord's orders!"

Lie Kong had not known Yang Kai was the Star Lord before, but now, learning Yang Kai was the Dark Star's Star Lord and offered a Heavenly Restoration Pill, Lie Kong dared not be remiss and pledged fealty at once.

Sha Hu's expression shifted; he quickly cupped his hands and said, "My Sea Hall is the same. If the Star Lord has any orders in the future, just speak them and the Sea Hall will go through fire and water for you."

"Appreciated," Yang Kai said faintly and closed his eyes to quietly sense.

He could feel Yang Yan taking Lin Yun'er and gradually leaving Dark Star; he didn't know their destination, but he did know their final goal was the mysterious Star Realm.

After an incense stick's time, Yang Yan and Lin Yun'er's auras vanished from Yang Kai's perception as they left Dark Star and entered the vast Star Domain.

He opened his eyes, waved at Sha Hu and Lie Kong, and then vanished.

After some movements, he returned to Lingxiao Sect's Tianyi Palace and sat to meditate in seclusion.

Few people knew of Yang Yan's reprimand of Wu Shengfeng — only some experts from the two forces above Wuyou Sea had witnessed it. Under strict orders from Sha Hu and Lie Kong, no one dared speak of it; the incident was thus swallowed by the currents of history, with only brief mention in the two powers' core records.
