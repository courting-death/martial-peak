## Chapter 2475 — Never Underestimated Himself

At one moment the middle-aged man turned his head as if he'd discovered something. His eyes widened, and his furious mood fell away, replaced by excitement that made his body tremble.

“Hahahaha!” he suddenly burst out laughing. “A seed has matured! Finally, a seed has matured. Who is it? Who!”

He raved for a while, too excited to control himself. Soon he summoned a warship and rumbled toward the depths of the Shattered Star Sea—heading for the Origin Sea.

……

Time continued to pass.

Although Yang Kai kept part of his mind on his surroundings, ready to put away his Incarnation and Xuan Realm Pearl at the first sign of anyone approaching, he didn’t let it delay his absorption and refining.

The Xuan Realm Pearl and the Incarnation were absorbing ever more fiercely, to Yang Kai's surprise.

One day, two days, five days, ten days…

The area of the Origin Sea had shrunk drastically compared to the beginning. Not only that, but the Origin Power remaining in the Origin Sea was now countless times thinner than before.

Now, not only did the martial artists at the edges notice something was wrong, but even those deep inside did as well.

In the deepest part of the Origin Sea, in the territory occupied by the Emperor Realm masters.

The red-haired youth who had previously attacked Yang Kai suddenly frowned and looked up, only to see someone standing alone in midair, staring at him coldly.

The red-haired youth grinned, showing no fear as he looked back.

“Was this your doing?” the newcomer sized up the red-haired youth for a moment before suddenly asking an out-of-the-blue question.

The red-haired youth pondered and said, “I’d like to know who’s behind this myself!”

The two exchanged glances, then simultaneously looked in the same direction.

The red-haired youth said, “The Origin Power seems to be flowing that way.”

The newcomer nodded, his expression grave. “That direction is where Yao Si is!”

“Yao Si!” The red-haired youth’s eyes narrowed at the words, a hint of dread appearing on his face. It seemed this Yao Si had quite the background, enough that even as an Emperor Realm master, he didn’t dare take him lightly.

“Shall we go take a look?” the newcomer asked.

The red-haired youth sneered, “So you came to me for this? Are all you Southern Territory martial artists so timid?”

The newcomer snorted but didn’t deny it, only saying, “Yao Si is, after all, the son of a Great Emperor!”

The red-haired youth sneered, “Doesn’t your Southern Territory also have a Great Emperor’s child here? Why not go to her instead of coming to me?”

The other replied, “She hasn’t reached the Emperor Realm yet, so it’s useless to ask her. If you’re scared, I’ll go check it out myself.”

“Who says I’m scared!” the red-haired youth snapped, standing up as he spoke. He said fiercely, “If anyone dares to steal my Origin Power, even a Great Emperor’s child will have to cough it up!”

He shot into the air, flying straight toward where Yao Si was. Seeing this, the other hurried to follow.

Before long, the two suddenly noticed something unusual. Not far ahead, on a vast island, three newly advanced Emperor Realm masters had gathered, and among them was the Yao Si they were looking for.

Standing before the three Emperor Realm masters was a young man at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

No one knew what the four were doing at that moment. They were just glaring at each other, with no intention of making a move. What shocked the two newcomers most was that the young man at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm showed no fear at all in the face of three Emperor Realm masters.

“It’s him!”

The red-haired youth couldn’t help but exclaim in a low voice.

The other asked in surprise, “You know him?”

The red-haired youth’s face darkened as he replied, “Half a month ago, this guy passed by where I was and took a blow from me without a scratch.”

The other’s expression changed slightly at these words, as if he couldn’t believe it.

The red-haired youth said, “I didn’t hold back. This guy is interesting. If he can advance to the Emperor Realm, his future will be limitless. I wonder which territory’s disciple he is—definitely not from my Eastern Territory.”

The other didn’t reply, but the shock in his heart lingered for a long time, his gaze fixed on the Dao Origin Realm youth.

“Let’s go down and take a look.” The red-haired youth called out, leading the way toward the island.

On the island, Yang Kai wore a displeased expression.

Earlier, while he was happily absorbing Origin Power, he suddenly sensed someone approaching. In a panic, he quickly put away the Xuan Realm Pearl and the Incarnation, but before he could react, three Emperor Realm masters appeared before him, all glaring at him with murderous looks.

These three Emperor Realm masters were undoubtedly all newly advanced in the Shattered Star Sea, and though their realms seemed unstable, they still carried the aura of true experts.

Yang Kai could more or less guess why they had found him—he’d made too much commotion absorbing Origin Power and attracted their attention.

This was inevitable. Yang Kai hadn’t expected the Xuan Realm Pearl and the Incarnation together to cause such a stir, and the fact that it had lasted half a month was already beyond his expectations.

In this half month, whether it was the Incarnation, the Xuan Realm Pearl, or Yang Kai himself, all had gained unimaginable benefits.

Perhaps all the martial artists in the Origin Sea combined hadn’t absorbed as much Origin Power as he had.

Now, the Origin Power in the Origin Sea had shrunk dramatically and was no longer as dense as before.

Two more people flew over and landed nearby.

Yang Kai glanced over and his eyes lit up. Spotting a familiar face among the newcomers, he called out with a grin, “Oh, Brother Wuchang! Long time no see.”

He had some impression of the red-haired youth—half a month ago, this youth had attacked him. If he remembered right, his name was Red Ghost! And the one who came with Red Ghost was Wuchang of Tianwu Sacred Land, one of the Southern Territory’s top rising stars.

Yang Kai wasn’t surprised that Wuchang could advance to the Emperor Realm, but meeting him here was a bit unexpected.

Red Ghost immediately turned to Wuchang and asked, “You know this kid?”

“No, never met him, don’t ask me!” Wuchang replied coldly.

Though he had no grudge with Yang Kai, they weren’t friends either. Now, with Yang Kai having angered everyone, Wuchang didn’t want to get involved.

Yang Kai scowled, “Brother Wuchang, why so heartless? Back in the Four Seasons Land, we worked together quite well, and it ended well for both of us. Even if you don’t want to remember old times, you don’t have to be so cold!”

Wuchang snapped, “Cooperation? Don’t make it sound so nice. It was nothing more than a trade—each of us got what we wanted, that’s all.”

Yang Kai grinned, “A trade is still cooperation. Didn’t you benefit from it, Brother Wuchang? You advanced to the Emperor Realm so quickly, I had a hand in that, didn’t I? Xia Sheng is still working hard to break through.”

He stared intently at Wuchang, clearly hinting at something.

Wuchang naturally knew Yang Kai was talking about the Supreme Mystic Pill. He snorted coldly, “A deal is a deal—we owe each other nothing.”

“Brother Wuchang, you might as well change your name to Heartless!” Yang Kai said in disappointment.

Red Ghost exclaimed from the side, “Kid, explain yourself. What did you two trade that could help someone advance to the Emperor Realm?”

The other three Emperor Realm masters also looked interested. Though they had already advanced, and might not need that mysterious item, anything that could help someone become an Emperor was no ordinary thing. If they could get some, it would be a huge boon for their sects.

Every one of these Emperor Realm masters was the descendant of a top expert, with the backing of a sect.

“Who are you calling a kid!” Yang Kai’s face darkened as he glared at Red Ghost. “You ginger ghost really have a way with words!”

“He actually… called me a ginger ghost!” Red Ghost’s eyes nearly popped out.

The others were also shocked, looking at Yang Kai in disbelief.

After all, among the six here, only Yang Kai was at the Dao Origin Realm, while the rest were Emperors. Yet Yang Kai showed no fear, speaking freely, even being rude to Red Ghost.

It was truly astonishing.

One of the three Emperor Realm masters, a young man in tight clothes, laughed, “Red Ghost, you’ve been underestimated.”

Red Ghost shot Yang Kai an annoyed glare before snorting, “It’s not that I was underestimated—it’s that he never underestimated himself!”

Everyone understood at once—Red Ghost meant that Yang Kai didn’t think less of himself just because his cultivation was lower, so he spoke without restraint.

“I heard he took a blow from you before?” the young man in tight clothes asked.

Red Ghost snorted, “That’s right. I used seventy percent of my strength, and he blocked it completely.”

“Oh?” Another young man, shrouded in black mist, raised his eyebrows and looked Yang Kai up and down, as if seeing him in a new light.

Red Ghost’s seventy percent strength was not something an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator could withstand. Even the best among them would be seriously injured, but Red Ghost said Yang Kai blocked it completely. That was quite something.

“Haha, looks like those from your Ahan Palace aren’t so great after all,” the young man in tight clothes laughed.

Red Ghost was immediately displeased and snapped, “You talk like you did any better. Don’t tell me this kid didn’t pass through your territory too.”

The young man in tight clothes just curled his lips.

This was the other of the only two who had attacked Yang Kai before, the one who had unleashed a spear light at him. No one knew which sect he was from.

Red Ghost waved his hand, “No need to argue over trivial matters. I want to know what you’re all doing here.”

The last one, a chubby Emperor Realm master with a simple and honest face, said, “Didn’t you notice anything strange about the Origin Sea?”

This man was extremely fat, with so much flesh on his face that his eyes were nearly hidden, and he wasn’t tall. From a distance, one might mistake him for a winter melon.

But despite his comical appearance, he was a genuine Emperor Realm master.1
