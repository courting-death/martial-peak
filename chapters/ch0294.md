## Chapter 294 — Escape

The woman was filled with rage, resembling an angry little tiger, and exclaimed, “That person is called Yang Kai, right? Senior Brother Fan has been in seclusion ever since he returned to Ziwei Valley, saying he wants to cultivate diligently so that he won't be unable to defeat even a disciple of a second-rate Sect. He hasn't been seen for a long time, all because of this Yang Kai. This time, if I catch him, I will definitely make him pay!”

The Senior Brother she mentioned was none other than Fan Hong, who had visited Lingxiao Pavilion that day.

Luo Xiaoman and Fan Hong were both elite disciples of Ziwei Valley, having grown up together, and their feelings for each other ran deep. However, having not seen her beloved for several months, she naturally blamed Yang Kai for all of this.

Qiu Yimeng smiled at her and gently said, “Xiaoman, don’t be too angry. We mainly came this time to gather information about the evil lord; everything else is secondary. Don’t ruin the big plan!”

Luo Xiaoman huffed, “I don’t care! In any case, this time I must capture Yang Kai and bring him back to Ziwei Valley so that Senior Brother can have a good fight with him and resolve his heart’s knot.”

As she spoke, she shook Qiu Yimeng’s arm and sweetly pleaded, “Sister Qiu, he’s just a disciple of a second-rate Sect, right? When you’re handling the big matter later, I’ll secretly bring him out. I guarantee it won’t disturb anyone.”

Qiu Yimeng sighed with a bitter smile and nodded helplessly, “Alright, after all, he’s just a young disciple. I don’t think Lingxiao Pavilion is that ungrateful.”

“Hehe, Sister Qiu is the best!” Luo Xiaoman laughed happily.

However, Bai Yunfeng coughed lightly from the side and smiled, “Junior Sister Luo, it’s not that I want to diminish my own prestige while boosting his. That Yang Kai is not some easy opponent. Over a year ago, he was merely at the Separation and Union Realm, yet he managed to defeat me. My strength is on par with Senior Brother Fan’s, and after more than a year, who knows how much he has grown? So, even if you can capture him and bring him back to Ziwei Valley for Senior Brother to duel, I’m afraid…”

“Hmph! How could my Senior Brother lose to someone from such a small place?” Luo Xiaoman snorted lightly. Her eyes twinkled as she said, “At worst… I’ll just do something to him to ensure Senior Brother can defeat him.”

While they were talking, a master at the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm nearby suddenly frowned and said, “Miss, something seems off. There don’t appear to be many people here!”

Qiu Yimeng’s expression changed slightly as she said in a deep voice, “What do you mean?”

The man quickly released his Divine Sense, and after a moment, he looked strange and said, “It seems Lingxiao Pavilion knows it has stirred up great trouble and has already made preparations. There are five masters at the Divine Roaming Realm on alert over here, and over there, many people are gathered together. They should be the younger generation disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, and it looks like they are about to leave!”

“Delusional!” Qiu Yimeng coldly snorted, “Send some people to capture all five Divine Roaming Realm experts. If they dare to resist, kill them without mercy! The rest follow me!”

“Yes!”

Because Bai Yunfeng had previously provided intelligence about the existence of two peak Divine Roaming Realm experts, Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya, the Qiu Family had directly dispatched four peak Divine Roaming Realm masters this time.

With these four in command, they believed they could easily subdue Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya.

A large group of people suddenly split into two batches, moving in an orderly manner. The four peak Divine Roaming Realm experts led the way, followed by seven or eight other Divine Roaming Realm masters, heading straight towards the location of Ling Taixu and the others. The rest hurried towards the Dragon Confinement Ravine under Qiu Yimeng's lead.

At the Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai and Su Yan were enjoying a moment of tranquil intimacy when suddenly, Yang Kai's expression changed, and he looked up in a certain direction.

“What’s wrong?” Su Yan noticed Yang Kai’s change and quickly asked.

“Someone is coming!” Yang Kai’s face darkened. He hurriedly shouted, “Move faster! Those people have already discovered us!”

Above, there were still about twenty young disciples who had not been brought down. Upon hearing Yang Kai’s shout, the several Senior Aunts quickly urged their True Yuan, their speed suddenly increasing significantly.

The young disciples were sent down one after another, disappearing into the void passage.

Moments later, everyone was safely settled.

“Junior Nephew…” The several Senior Aunts flew to the side, their expressions extremely vigilant, as if facing a great enemy.

“You all go first!” Yang Kai shouted sternly, “I’ll hold them off!”

“Oh!” The others did not hesitate and quickly dove into the void passage.

“Where do you think you’re going?” A furious shout came from afar. Before the voice faded, a streak of light shot over rapidly.

The speed of the newcomer exceeded Yang Kai’s imagination.

Both Yang Kai and Su Yan’s expressions changed slightly as they urged their True Yuan together, simultaneously striking out towards the light.

With a muffled sound, the light burst apart, and the figures of twenty or thirty people suddenly appeared. Yang Kai and Su Yan were also jolted back, sliding back over ten zhang, nearly falling down.

“Yang Kai… we meet again!” In the crowd, Bai Yunfeng, dressed in white, roared with a twisted expression.

Enemies meet, and they are especially hostile. Bai Yunfeng naturally would not give Yang Kai a good face.

“You are that Yang Kai?” Luo Xiaoman looked him up and down, curling her lips, “Not that impressive. I thought you had three heads and six arms, but you’re just average.”

Qiu Yimeng smiled lightly, her gaze curious. When she saw Su Yan, her eyes couldn’t help but narrow slightly.

From this young woman, cold as an ancient frozen mountain, Qiu Yimeng sensed a powerful pressure.

A master! And one whose strength was not lower than her own! A glimmer of surprise flashed in Qiu Yimeng’s beautiful eyes, as she hadn’t expected such talent to exist in a small place like Lingxiao Pavilion.

Moreover, this woman was not only powerful but also stunningly beautiful. Compared to her, Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but feel a sense of inferiority.

Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but snort lightly, quickly dispelling the faint jealousy in her heart.

“We came to your sect this time merely to inquire about something. I hope you can be accommodating,” Qiu Yimeng took a deep breath and spoke to Yang Kai and Su Yan while glancing towards the dark void passage.

With her knowledge and status, she didn’t know what this thing was for, and couldn’t help but look at it curiously a few more times.

Yang Kai sneered, “What you call seeking advice is this grand assault on Lingxiao Pavilion?”

Over there, the sounds of battle between Ling Taixu and the others had already begun. Clearly, many Divine Roaming Realm experts had arrived and started fighting without any greeting.

Qiu Yimeng remained unfazed, still smiling lightly, “If we don’t show some strength, how would your sect cooperate obediently? This is merely a tactic. I advise you not to resist; otherwise, you might suffer some hardships.”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. There were at least twenty or thirty people opposite him, and among them were not a few Divine Roaming Realm experts. Many Divine Senses were locked onto him and Su Yan.

If he and Su Yan made any moves, they would likely be ruthlessly slaughtered!

The void passage was just over ten zhang away, and it was still open, but it wouldn’t be long before it closed.

Could they break through? Yang Kai had no confidence. He glanced at Su Yan, whose expression remained calm and indifferent, even in the face of twenty or thirty experts.

“It seems you two are unwilling to cooperate. In that case, I’m sorry, go and seal their cultivation and bring them back!” Qiu Yimeng decisively issued the order, her face always wearing a faint smile, her demeanor calm and unhurried.

“Yes!” Immediately, two Divine Roaming Realm experts flew out from behind her, sneering contemptuously as they approached Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Yang Kai tightened his grip on Su Yan’s hand and whispered, “You go first, don’t worry about me. They won’t dare to do anything to me.”

Su Yan was taken aback and gently nodded. At this critical moment, she did not want to stay with Yang Kai like some clueless women, because she knew that Yang Kai’s true identity was the greatest protection. If she stayed, it would only worsen the situation.

In an instant, the two had reached an agreement.

The two approaching Divine Roaming Realm experts were now within five zhang.

At that moment, dark energy surged beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine, and dozens of pitch-black, dragon-like demonic energies surged up rapidly, striking the two Divine Roaming Realm experts like lightning.

The evil energy contained unparalleled ferocity. Although the direct impact did not cause them much harm, the effect of attacking their souls and affecting their minds was evident.

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts looked shocked, their faces twisted in pain, their eyes suddenly turning crimson, losing all rationality, as if caged beasts that had been imprisoned for hundreds of years were finally released, they turned on each other!

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he immediately realized that the Earth Demon sensed his urgency and was using its means to help him from below.

Unfortunately, the Earth Demon could only do this much.

“Run!” Yang Kai shouted loudly, quickly pulling Su Yan towards the void passage.

The sudden change left the Qiu Family, Bai Family, and Ziwei Valley forces in shock, feeling the evil contained within the dozens of dragon-like energies, and everyone turned pale.

Before they could react, Yang Kai and Su Yan had broken through the blockade and swiftly approached the dark passage.

“Stop them!” Qiu Yimeng shouted, leading the charge, fiercely unleashing her killing move while flying forward.

“Where do you think you’re going?” Luo Xiaoman hurriedly followed. She was determined to capture Yang Kai and bring him back to Ziwei Valley for Fan Hong to defeat him, so she would never allow Yang Kai to escape.

With the two women moving, the others also sprang into action.

In an instant, Yang Kai and Su Yan had already entered the void passage, with Su Yan in front and Yang Kai at the rear.

Once inside the chaotic passage, Yang Kai quickly turned back, fiercely urging his True Yuan, striking out at the surroundings.

He needed to destroy this passage to ensure the safety of those in Lingxiao Pavilion.

But Qiu Yimeng and the others were also incredibly fast. Before Yang Kai could break the void passage, a large portion of them had already entered.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman led the way, glancing around at the chaotic surroundings, their faces filled with shock.

The two women had no idea where this place was. But since Yang Kai dared to enter, it surely wouldn’t be dangerous.

With their thoughts racing, Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman simultaneously unleashed their killing moves against Yang Kai.

Within the void passage, True Yuan was chaotic, and the violent shockwaves generated by the collisions scattered everywhere, causing the chaotic space to suddenly shift and writhe.
