## Chapter 1558 — Witness

Xia Ningshang stared at Yang Kai with an expression of utter shock.

She had never imagined that even stars could be born, age, fall ill, and die; Yang Kai's words struck her to the core.

But since it came from her Junior Brother's mouth, she believed it without question.

At the thought of the entire Tongxuan Continent's vitality ebbing away into a silence of death, Xia Ningshang's delicate frame trembled — she could not fathom how many living beings would suffer, how many lives would simply vanish if the continent truly became such a place.

A sudden well of grief filled her heart.

"Junior Brother, can its flame be rekindled?" Xia Ningshang asked abruptly.

Yang Kai turned to look at her and nodded lightly.

"How do we do it? Teach me, Junior Brother!" Xia Ningshang bit her red lips and asked urgently.

"The key lies with you." Yang Kai inhaled deeply. "Although the Stellar Origin has its own life, it lacks consciousness — it is a wondrous amalgam. It chose you; at first its aim was to siphon your life force to replenish itself and slow its death. But handled correctly, not only could the Tongxuan Continent be revived, you would gain tremendous benefits."

Xia Ningshang's expression trembled.

Yang Kai turned his head and clicked his tongue, studying the vast grey flame below with keen interest.

Stellar Origin! Ever since he entered the Star Domain he'd often heard mention of such things, but he'd never personally witnessed a star's origin power.

Whether the energy within the Floating Continent truly was an origin remained to be verified.

One could say the huge grey flame before him was the first origin he had ever seen.

This was a once-in-ten-thousand-years opportunity!

Origin power was terrifying. Anyone approaching risked incredible danger; even experts of the Void King Realm would not dare casually approach the Stellar Origin of a cultivation star.

Refining such power was equally perilous — one slip and the origin would lash back, reducing the refiner to ashes on the spot.

Through history many Void King Realm experts had arisen from the Star Domain; many at that level perished while attempting to refine a Stellar Origin.

There are countless cultivation stars in the present Star Domain, yet those who could refine a star's Stellar Origin and rise to Star Lord rank were vanishingly few.

No Void King Realm expert would gamble their life lightly; they'd rather cultivate patiently than rashly attempt to refine a Stellar Origin.

Yet now such an opportunity lay before Xia Ningshang.

Compared with the origins of other cultivation stars, the Tongxuan Continent's origin power was undoubtedly aged, on its last decline.

Precisely because of this, the origin attached to Xia Ningshang sometimes left her fatigued, lazy even to think, giving rise to a baseless sensation of aging.

It wasn't that she was aging — the origin itself was decaying, step by step marching toward extinction!

This origin power chose Xia Ningshang and granted her the qualification to refine it.

Although Xia Ningshang was only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm and insufficiently powerful, with enough perseverance and absolute courage she might still have a chance to refine such an origin.

Even Yang Kai felt a twinge of envy at her opportunity.

Though dangerous, the arrow was already on the string and must be released.

The origin's fate was tightly bound to Xia Ningshang's — her loss would mean its loss; only by refining it could she win that slender thread of life.

In the future, as Xia Ningshang grew stronger, that vast grey flame might be reborn from ashes and restore vigor to the Tongxuan Continent.

Of course, that required Xia Ningshang to grow sufficiently powerful.

After Yang Kai explained the principles and stakes, Xia Ningshang nodded without hesitation: "I am willing to refine it!"

Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment, then smiled and nodded. "Good. Actually, Little Senior Sister, you needn't worry — since it chose you there must be a reason. You only need to work hard: let it accept you, let yourself fuse with it. Once successful, you and it will be inseparable; you will become the Star Lord of the Tongxuan Continent, its sovereign. Its glory or decline will rest upon your single thought!"

"Mm." Xia Ningshang bowed heavily, not intoxicated by Yang Kai's rosy picture but solemn as she asked, "But what exactly must I do to refine it?"

"Come, I'll transmit a set of techniques to you — a method dedicated to refining Stellar Origins." Yang Kai smiled faintly and helped Xia Ningshang sit down.

After she lowered the defenses of her Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai sent his Spirit Body into her Sea of Consciousness and began pouring out an extraordinarily profound technique.

The Star Refining Technique!

It was something he had obtained from the Imperial Garden.

He had expected to save it for the day he himself might refine a Stellar Origin; he did not expect to allow Xia Ningshang to benefit from it in advance.

The technique had been hidden within a stone stele.

The day in the Imperial Garden when Yang Kai, Shan Qingluo, and Xue Yue encountered one another had resulted in a fierce battle; the stele was smashed, and from its fragments a stone plaque sprang forth bearing three ancient characters.

Xue Yue seemed to treasure the plaque dearly and begged Yang Kai to give it to her.

Yang Kai nearly obliged.

In the end, however, the closing of the Imperial Garden caused Xue Yue to miss out on the plaque.

After returning to Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai studied it carefully and discovered that the plaque contained the Star Refining Technique — the three ancient characters on the plaque were the name of the technique.

The technique had no other use; it existed solely for refining Stellar Origins, passed down from the Starry Sky Emperor, deep and wondrous.

Using it to refine the Stellar Origin would make Xia Ningshang's efforts far more efficient.

The transmission was swift; in less than half a cup of tea Yang Kai had engraved the entire Star Refining Technique into Xia Ningshang's mind, including his own insights.

With his Spirit Body withdrawing from her Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai waited in silence.

Xia Ningshang needed time to contemplate the Star Refining Technique; she needed time.

Outside, the sun rose and set; the cavern lay silent.

Only a month later did Xia Ningshang suddenly open her beautiful eyes and exhale softly; her pretty face looked a little tired, but her gaze was filled with exhilaration.

"Junior Brother, I'm ready."

"Then begin." Yang Kai watched her with burning eyes.

Xia Ningshang nodded gently, rose, and walked toward the abyss beneath the earth.

At the edge of the abyss she stared at the leaping vast grey flame below, lips barely parting as if speaking to herself or communicating with the origin: "If offering my life can make you shine again and prevent the entire continent from falling into silence, then I'm willing. But if not, then accept me and fuse with me so that we fight side by side. I will train hard and become strong as soon as possible to restore your vigor!"

The great grey flame below remained motionless with no response.

Soon there came a soft hissing, and the grey flame swayed left and right; with that movement the mass of flame unfurled like a budding blossom, slowly opening toward all directions as if stretching out its arms to embrace Xia Ningshang.

A faint smile appeared on Xia Ningshang's face as she whispered, "Thank you!"

With that she suddenly leaped down.

Yang Kai's face changed drastically.

The result completely exceeded his expectations; he hadn't imagined Little Senior Sister would be so resolute.

By the time he reacted and tried to stop her, it was too late.

Rushing to the abyss's edge, he saw the vast grey flame had already closed, utterly enveloping Little Senior Sister's figure.

An unimaginable force erupted from below, lifting Yang Kai and hurling him against the rock wall.

Even a decaying origin's power was not something Yang Kai could approach.

It clearly did not want him interfering with the process.

Yang Kai climbed to his feet, his expression unsettled, but he could sense Little Senior Sister's aura rising and falling in the depths below.

He waited anxiously.

There was nothing he could do to interfere now; he could only wait for the outcome.

Gradually, an incomprehensible marvel began to emanate from the abyss, calming Yang Kai's agitated heart.

He frowned and silently probed these wondrous energies.

It was as if he glimpsed something.

He hastily closed his eyes to examine it more carefully.

A boundless Star Domain, pitch-black and lightless, as if a time without light or life — an ancient era beyond tracing.

Yang Kai looked about and perceived nothing; he could not even sense his own presence.

Time passed in that desolate loneliness, moment by moment.

After who knew how many tens of thousands of years, a point of light suddenly erupted in that boundless darkness; at first small, it quickly spread like sparks, fanning outward.

The entire Star Domain quivered under the assault of that vast energy.

Сhunks of meteorites, great and small, crashed about and converged; under the fusion of a marvel, they combined into one.

Gathering sand into a tower, gradually a star appeared in the Star Domain.

It was a newly born star, devoid of energy fluctuations, still surrounded by darkness; it drifted like a bewildered child, wandering the vast Star Domain with no destination and forgetting where it had come from.

Millions of years later it suddenly entered a world of light, a realm with a colossal sun emitting gentle, heat-filled radiance at all times.

It halted and began to orbit that sun.

Gradually, life appeared: upon its land sprouted green plants, flowers, and grasses.

After several more million years of evolution, sentient beings finally began to appear upon this star — the oldest of creatures, the most ancient races.

They learned, grew, and strengthened with ravenous eagerness in their daily lives.

Branches formed, and different races came into being one after another.

Humans, yao, demon folk, and many other strange-shaped species emerged.

Unsatisfied with simple existence, they began to battle for resources; they sought methods to strengthen themselves and began to cultivate.

Some races perished while others grew stronger.
