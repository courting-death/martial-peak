## Chapter 60 — The Elder, Please Stay

“Entering the mining area?” Long Zaitian’s face instantly darkened as he scrutinized Yang Kai with sharp suspicion. “He’s not a disciple of the gang, is he?”

Yang Kai stepped forward respectfully. “I am a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion.”

“No disciples of the gang are allowed in here!” Long Zaitian snorted disdainfully, clearly displeased. “Even disciples of the gang cannot enter the mining area at will, let alone an outsider like you.”

He then turned to Hu Mei’er with a look of deep sorrow. “Miss, how could you bring an outsider here? You’re young and inexperienced in worldly matters. As the saying goes, ‘You can know a person’s face but not their heart.’ Over the years, our gang has made considerable profits from this mining area, and many envious eyes are watching closely—especially some petty scoundrels who are constantly scheming to gather information about the mines. If I, an old man, were not stationed here all year round, who knows what trouble might have arisen.”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. This old man’s veiled reproach was truly unpleasant to hear.

Sensing Yang Kai’s displeasure, Hu Mei’er quickly interjected, “Grandfather Long, you’ve misunderstood. He’s not here to spy or anything, just to buy some things.”

Long Zaitian sneered. “Buy things? Do you think you can just buy your way into this place? What a laughable excuse. Boy, I don’t care what your true intentions are. Get lost now, and if you dare show your face here again, I’ll see if I don’t kill you myself.”

Anger surged within Yang Kai, but he knew better than to act rashly. The old man’s strength far exceeded his own; any confrontation would only end badly for him.

Suppressing his fury, Yang Kai remained silent. Any conflict now would only bring him harm.

“You’re a coward!” Long Zaitian sneered even more contemptuously at Yang Kai’s silence.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s True Yang Primordial Qi surged uncontrollably, his gaze burning fiercely at Long Zaitian.

Noticing the change in Yang Kai’s energy, Long Zaitian’s fury flared. “How dare you! You want to fight me?”

Without warning, disregarding their difference in status and strength, Long Zaitian struck out with a palm toward Yang Kai. The moment the palm came down, Yang Kai found himself unable to move, frozen in place—not out of fear, but because some technique had bound him.

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically. He had not expected the old man to be so shameless. He could feel Long Zaitian’s hostility, but could not fathom the reason. Now, with a sudden attack, Yang Kai was truly shocked to his core.

The aura of death pressed down upon him. The overwhelming pressure from a Divine Roaming Realm expert caused his heart to skip a beat and his breath to falter. A desperate will to survive surged through his body.

Suddenly, a scorching heat radiated through his bones, spreading rapidly. In the next moment, the binding force vanished.

Seizing the moment, Yang Kai summoned all his strength and swiftly dodged to the side.

Long Zaitian casually slapped his palm down, expecting to crush this Lingxiao Pavilion disciple outright, but to his surprise, Yang Kai evaded the strike!

Impossible! Long Zaitian frowned deeply.

How could his Divine Roaming Realm binding technique be broken by this youth? Because he had not anticipated this, his casual palm strike had failed.

Although Long Zaitian's attack missed Yang Kai, it left him in an utterly disheveled state. His face turned deathly pale in an instant, and sweat drenched his body. When he finally regained his footing and looked at Long Zaitian again, there was now a chilling glint in Yang Kai’s eyes.

If earlier Yang Kai had only been annoyed by Long Zaitian’s attitude, now it was genuine hatred. The old man’s intent to take his life was no longer concealed, as if he meant to crush an ant with ease.

Long Zaitian understood this well. Though he did not know why his binding had failed, now that he had resolved to kill Yang Kai, he would not stop easily. Without hesitation, he prepared to strike again.

At this moment, Hu Mei’er snapped out of her shock and hurriedly stepped in front of Yang Kai, glaring fiercely at Long Zaitian. Her voice was sharp and urgent: “Grandfather Long, he is my friend! What do you intend to do?”

“Anyone attempting to spy on the mining area shall be killed on sight! That is the gang leader’s order!” Long Zaitian fixed Hu Mei’er with a deep gaze, a flicker of surprise crossing his eyes.

Hu Mei’er often associated with young men but had never defended any of them so recklessly. For most of those men, their fates were grim. Yet this time, she threw herself in front of this Lingxiao Pavilion disciple and challenged Long Zaitian with fierce words.

This was unprecedented! Long Zaitian’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully, the murderous intent thickening.

Hu Mei’er stood firm, shielding Yang Kai, gritting her teeth as she said, “I told you, my friend only came to buy something, not to spy on the mining area! Grandfather Long, do you not believe my words?”

Seeing Hu Mei’er’s strong defense of Yang Kai, Long Zaitian could no longer persist in his obstinacy. He said, “I do not dare doubt the young lady’s words.”

“Then why act so harshly?”

“I admit my mistake and beg the young lady’s forgiveness.”

The Blood Battle Gang was different from Fengyu Tower and Lingxiao Pavilion; it was a family-based power with the Hu family in charge. Even as deputy leader, Long Zaitian had to show face to Hu Mei’er.

“But I must ask the young lady to understand—this mining area is a grave matter. Outsiders must never enter!” Having said this, Long Zaitian ignored Hu Mei’er and gave Yang Kai a cold snort before turning to leave.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming the turbulent energy within his chest, then called out, “Elder, please wait!”

Long Zaitian turned impatiently, narrowing his eyes as a murderous aura surged forth.

“Elder, I am no match for you now,” Yang Kai said calmly as he stepped in front of Hu Mei’er, unafraid as he met Long Zaitian’s gaze. “So I will endure today’s humiliation. But five years, ten years from now, I will settle this debt. I hope you live to see that day.”

Yang Kai’s tone was steady, but his words carried deep sincerity.

Long Zaitian’s expression turned cold, then he laughed heartily. “Whether I live to see that day is none of your concern. But I believe you will not live that long! Arrogant youth, be careful in the days to come!”

“I will.”

Long Zaitian left, and Hu Mei’er looked at Yang Kai with deep regret, repeatedly apologizing. “I’m sorry, I don’t know why Grandfather Long acted this way. If I had known, I wouldn’t have brought you here.”

“It’s alright.” Yang Kai took a deep breath, recalling the harrowing moment. He still felt a chill. Were it not for his Proud Bone Golden Body activating at the crucial moment, he might have died then and there. It was that scorching heat within his bones that broke Long Zaitian’s binding and allowed him to escape death.
