## Chapter 967 — May the Banner Bring Victory

The yao's several Great Lords had finished preparations a month ago, but because the demons did not arrive, they waited; only today, upon sensing the aura of demon experts, did they set out.

Within the Nine Peaks, the human onlookers watched the approaching experts from the other two races; many displayed expressions of fear and disgust.

They are not of our kind; their hearts must differ. Hatreds between races are not dissolved overnight—these are grievances carved into the bone.

Before long, Changyuan led four demon generals and several Saint Realm demon experts into the Nine Peaks, and at the same time the yao's three Great Lords also arrived.

Changyuan laughed heartily, swept his gaze indifferently around the crowd, and said with composure, “So many people… Had this Lord known there would be such a gathering, I wouldn’t have bothered coming all the way from the Demon Domain. It seems you humans could handle this yourselves after all. I thought none of you would step in.”

Lei Long nodded from the side and added, “Indeed, that is what this Lord thought as well.”

The two of them—each addressing themselves as “this Lord”—made the gathered human experts glare in anger, their faces dark with displeasure.

“Can you two just say a little less?” Yang Kai pushed through the crowd and glared at them. “Do you really have to stir up hatred between the three races before you’ll be satisfied? You’ve already come all this way—do you mean to turn back now?”

Changyuan snorted, a trace of caution flashing across his face. "I don't intend to leave, but I require a guarantee from you human experts: after we suppress the Bone Clan, do not seize the opportunity to attack my demons. Your kind's treachery is notorious. If you cannot promise that, I'll leave right now!"

"My yao likewise require a guarantee!" Lei Long declared.

In that instant, the yao and demon factions subtly stood on the same side.

Before coming they had not expected the humans to muster such a force; they had assumed human laxity and disunity, believing ten or so allied factions was already impressive. Arriving here, they discovered nearly all the human experts had gathered.

Just counting masters at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, there were five or six—this did not include those around Yang Kai.

Once the Bone Clan's crisis was resolved, if the humans were to kick them while they were down, neither Changyuan nor Lei Long could guarantee that everyone they brought would return safely.

At that moment both leaders secretly regretted having agreed so readily to Yang Kai.

"Do you believe my guarantee?" Yang Kai looked at the two of them calmly.

Changyuan and Lei Long both shook their heads. Yang Kai might have excellent aptitude, but he was after all an up-and-comer; while his word carried absolute authority within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, it held little weight among this assembly of human experts.

Changyuan and Lei Long both shook their heads. Though Yang Kai’s talent was remarkable, he was, after all, a latecomer. Within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, his word carried absolute authority, but among this assembly of Human experts, his weight was far less.  

Changyuan and Lei Long both shook their heads. Yang Kai’s aptitude was indeed impressive, but he was ultimately a latecomer. Within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land his authority was absolute, yet among this gathering of Human experts his words carried little weight.  

From the human side, someone sneered: “Do you take us for petty men, judging others by your own small-mindedness? If you insist on saying that, then even if we bore no ill will before, now we certainly will.”  

With that, he gave a sly, malicious smile.

Changyuan and Lei Long's expressions turned cold.

"How about this old man giving you a guarantee?" a clear voice rang out from the crowd.

Changyuan and Lei Long followed the sound. When they saw the elderly man approaching with a gentle smile, both were taken aback and solemnly clasped their fists. "Greetings, Elder Li!"

Elder Li came forward composedly, smiling slightly. "You're too polite. I can vouch for all the humans—once this matter is resolved, you may leave unharmed; no one will touch you. Do you two trust me?"

Lei Long and Changyuan exchanged glances and both nodded earnestly.

Lei Long laughed and said, “If there are still words from any human in this world that could convince me, then aside from Elder Li, it would only be Saint Lord Yang.”

"I mean the same," Changyuan agreed.

Elder Li let out a long sigh. “I’ve already learned the specifics from Young Friend Yang. The revival of the Bone Clan must not be underestimated. This time, the calamity engulfing heaven and earth may truly require the joint strength of Humans, Demons, and Yao to withstand. Therefore, I hope you can temporarily set aside the hatred between races and focus your aim on those outsiders from beyond the stars!”

"Elder Li speaks the truth!"

"At Elder Li's command!"

"We will spare no effort!"

The human experts in the crowd voiced their assent in turn; no one dared contradict Elder Li.

Yang Kai finally breathed a sigh of relief. He had been worrying that if Changyuan and Lei Long brought forces that clashed with the human side, they might start fighting the Bone Clan while their rear was ablaze—what a joke that would be.

Elder Li's sudden appearance defused this potential crisis.

At the very least, he had temporarily united the three races.

"I have another question," Changyuan suddenly called out. "If the three races join forces, whose orders will we follow?"

At that, everyone fell silent and pondered appropriate candidates; after a moment their gazes all turned to Elder Li.

Aside from Elder Li, there was no one capable of commanding the three races.

Elder Li shook his head with a wry smile. "You don't expect this old man to go to the battlefield, do you? My bones and sinews are old—if I went it would be suicide."

Disappointment flickered across many faces, but considering Elder Li's condition, no one dared urge him to fight the Bone Clan.

If anything happened to him, no one could shoulder that burden.

Elder Li stroked his white beard and said gravely, "Although I cannot go, I do have a candidate you might consider."

"Who?" many turned to Elder Li at once.

“What do you all think of Young Friend Yang? He is the one who initiated and brought this matter to light. If not for his warning to the world, we might have perished in our complacency. Moreover, his understanding of the situation surpasses any of ours. Most importantly, I’ve heard that Young Friend Yang bears no bias of race—he can befriend both the Yao and the Demons. Aside from him, is there anyone more suitable for the role?”
Among the humans many experts whispered—some nodded, some shook their heads; expressions varied.

Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment, then shook his head and said, “Elder Li, I fear I cannot take on this matter. I don’t like ordering others around, and I am still young, my strength shallow. Everyone here is a senior to me—how could I possibly command them?”

Elder Li said solemnly, "Do not undervalue yourself. Although your strength is not great now, achieving so much at your age makes you the foremost on the continent. Apart from the Great Demon God of ancient times, few could surpass you given time. Your achievements will not be inferior to the elders here, and you are the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—a title no less than anyone else's."

“That may be true…” Yang Kai frowned, but deep down he had no desire to take on this burning hot potato.  

Elder Li raised a hand to stop him. "A three-race alliance truly requires someone to weigh pros and cons and give orders. If you refuse, the alliance will be little more than scattered sand."

Changyuan nodded beside him. "I have no objection!"

Lei Long shrugged. "My yao agree as well!"

They seemed reassured by Yang Kai; after all they had no ties with the other human experts and even harbored grudges. If someone else tried to command them, they might be subjected to petty reprisals.

"Tianxiao Sect agrees," Chu Lingxiao said solemnly nearby.

“Yang Kai, ability comes with responsibility—don’t refuse,” Meng Wuya also advised.  

When these two spoke, many top human masters fell into thought.

Both Chu Lingxiao and Meng Wuya were among humanity's greatest experts, so their words carried heavy weight.

Soon the hesitant human experts realized in astonishment that although the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was young and not especially powerful, his network of connections was deeper than anyone else's.

He had gathered many Saint Realm experts under him; he hailed from Tianxiao Sect, was close to the former human top expert Meng Wuya, enjoyed Elder Li's favor, and had even befriended figures like Changyuan and the yao's three Great Lords.

Gradually, Yang Kai's standing in their minds climbed considerably, making them realize this young man might in the future command the world and dominate a region.

Once that thought took root, no one dared belittle Yang Kai again.

Voices rose in agreement, approving Elder Li's proposal.

Yang Kai's brow furrowed; instead of joy he felt a sense of repulsion.

Countless eyes turned to him, awaiting his answer.

Under pressure, he could not refuse.

If he truly declined, as Elder Li warned, the three-race alliance would be nothing but scattered sand.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai braced himself and said, “Then this junior will accept with gratitude. I must ask all the seniors here for your full support!”

Elder Li smiled and nodded in satisfaction. "Go forth without burden!"

Yang Kai nodded lightly; his gaze sharpened as he swept the crowd and called loudly, "Since everyone has gathered, let us waste no time—let's depart at once!"

"May the banner bring victory!" Elder Li clasped his fists solemnly.

"With Elder Li's auspice!" Yang Kai drew a deep breath and led the way, flying out of the Nine Peaks. Behind him Li Rong and Han Fei followed closely, never leaving his side.

Many human experts circulated their True Yuan and surged into the sky like a wave of locusts.

Changyuan and Lei Long exchanged glances and smiled faintly, then hurried to keep pace.

In an instant, clothes and sleeves billowed outside the Nine Peaks, crowds pressed together, and multi-colored blooms of True Yuan erupted in midair—spectacular and magnificent.

As they hurried on, many experts invoked their flying Secret Treasures to speed their advance.

Carriages, flying litters, long swords, caravan-wagons—treasures of every shape dazzled the eye.

Behind the human experts, the demon forces formed a roiling black cloud, concealing their figures and rushing forward.

Behind them came the yao's experts, some in transformed form and some not; many massive, ferocious demonic beasts thundered across the ground, yet their pace never lagged, sending up clouds of dust.

Elder Li stood within the Nine Peaks, watching the assembly of nearly all the world's experts disappear, and said to the Saint-Grade alchemists behind him, "Let us do our duty and refine more Saint Pills; when they return triumphant many will need healing and recovery."
