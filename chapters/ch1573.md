## Chapter 1573 — Pill Completion

This was Xia Ningshang's first time refining a spiritual pill that produced a Pill Cloud; if she succeeded, her pill-refining skill would leap forward. Given her special constitution, the insights gained from this refinement would become a guiding beacon to propel her dramatically forward on the Martial Dao.

This insight and experience meant a great deal to the Little Senior Sister.

Yang Kai valued it more than anyone, so his Divine Sense never left the inn, constantly watching to prevent anyone from scheming.

Fortunately, there were protectors like Ba He and Magna, and many yao experts of the Origin Returning Realm stood guard around them, so few dared act rashly.

"The herb fragrance seems to have grown a lot stronger — could it be forming the pill!"

"Tsk tsk… what kind of Spiritual Pill is this? Just one sniff of the aroma and my bottleneck seems to loosen a little?"

The martial artists gathered around continued to chatter, yet none could discern the exact variety of that Spiritual Pill.

At that moment, the rotating vortex in the sky suddenly changed again, as if an inexplicable attraction leaked from within the inn, crazily drawing the gathered Spiritual Qi over in that direction.

The great vortex spun into an inverted funnel shape, pouring downward.

In the space of half a cup of tea, the vortex vanished and the gathered Spiritual Qi disappeared without a trace; even the medicinal aroma that had been lingering at everyone's nostrils suddenly grew faint.

Inside the inn, there was absolute silence.

Had it succeeded? Or failed?

Countless martial artists craned their necks to see, eager to know the final result of the master refining inside the inn.

They did not know whether that master was old or young, male or female, yet they inexplicably hoped and felt nervous about this refinement.

It was not only ordinary martial artists who felt this way; Magna, Ba He, Mi Tian, each of them was the same. No matter how calm their outward demeanor, the changing expressions in their eyes were obvious.

Only Yang Kai, after silently sensing for a moment, smiled faintly.

Success!

With the Little Senior Sister's pill-refining talent and single-minded focus, producing such a Spiritual Pill was only natural; she should now be immersed in insight and harvest, and would need some time.

Yang Kai did not make it explicit; he simply watched the surroundings while waiting.

A day passed, two days passed…

Many onlookers could not endure the boredom. Unable to wait any longer, they quietly dispersed; only the experts with some connection to this matter remained waiting.

From time to time Ba He cast his gaze at Yang Kai, as if hoping to glean a clue or answer from him, but to his disappointment Yang Kai's expression was flawless and he could deduce nothing — so he waited patiently.

In the blink of an eye, five days had gone by.

The inn remained utterly still.

Anyone would grow impatient after waiting so long.

"Enough!" Mi Tian barked. "It looks like the one refining inside the inn failed and dares not show themselves. Magna, senior, order them seized."

"Seize them? Seize who?" Yang Kai glared at him and shouted fiercely, "Who dares seize anyone!"

Mi Tian sneered, "Human, what do you think this place is, that you have the right to bark orders? Magna, this fellow is so presumptuous, he doesn't even take you seriously. If you won't act, then I shall — I'll settle our previous grievances with him."

Magna frowned, uncertain what to do, and involuntarily cast a questioning look at Ba He.

Ba He said coldly, "Even if this master has failed this time, producing such a commotion while refining must mean they are an extraordinary figure; the Lady welcomes such talent."

Hearing this, Magna snapped out of it and nodded repeatedly, "Lord Ba He is right. This city lord really has never seen anyone whose refining could create such an impact; this talent must be presented to the Lady intact."

As they spoke, faint footsteps suddenly sounded from the inn.

Everyone's expressions shifted and they turned their gaze in that direction.

Yang Kai greeted her with a smile and quickly walked over.

Moments later, a graceful figure strolled out from the inn—her posture elegant and alluring, her slender waist flawless in its curves. Her jade-like fingers were long and fair, and the skin on the back of her hand looked so delicate it seemed it might bruise at a breath.

Mi Tian, who had harbored great hostility toward the so-called master inside the inn and wished to kill them, suddenly paused, eyes burning as he scrutinized her.

As the Young Son of the Thousand-Eyed Lord, Mi Tian was born with elevated status; because he practiced fiendish arts he was never short of women, and could pillage beauties from both human and yao clans at will.

But when he saw this figure, his eyes brightened.

Just the single figure made him curious to know what the woman looked like.

As his gaze rose, Mi Tian couldn't help but frown.

The woman had a black veil hiding her face, preventing him from seeing clearly, yet her clear, flawless eyes shone like the purest gemstones and instantly drew his attention.

A blue gem adorned her pure white forehead, making her appear all the more breathtakingly beautiful.

Clean! That was Mi Tian's first impression of Xia Ningshang.

So clean, like a mountain spring, that Mi Tian felt a stirring of desire and a wish to defile that purity to satisfy his profane appetites.

Looking her over again, Mi Tian suddenly found the black veil no longer displeasing; instead, it seemed a masterstroke that elevated her immaculate purity to an even higher plane.

Without that veil's obscuring haze, that pure beauty might lose something — it was precisely this veil-like barrier that made her all the more intriguing.

Mi Tian's mood shifted; a faint smile appeared at his mouth's corner while an odd, sinister light flickered in his eyes.

"Junior Brother, sorry!" Xia Ningshang seemed a little uneasy as she apologized softly.

She had noticed some commotion outside the inn while refining, but had been too absorbed to investigate. Only after finishing the refinement did she truly grasp what had happened.

Producing such a spectacle while refining a pill would certainly draw a great deal of attention.

Seeing so many people outside now, and Yang Kai among them, she immediately realized how much pressure Yang Kai had borne for her during the refinement.

"Don't mention it — thanks to Senior Sister, we can enter the palace quickly." Yang Kai grinned, took her small hand, and led her toward Ba He.

Mi Tian's eye twitched; his gaze toward Yang Kai grew ever more hostile.

It was as if his forbidden prize had been touched!

"A woman?" Magna was dumbfounded.

At the instant Xia Ningshang made her appearance, countless yao martial artists were stunned.

They had never expected that the master inside the inn would be a woman, and such a young, pure and beautiful one at that.

In their imagination someone titled 'master' and capable of creating such a spectacle would be an elder, at least an aged person; nowhere did they expect reality to differ so greatly from their assumption.

Magna could hardly believe his eyes and cast his gaze toward Ba He.

“Don’t doubt it—she’s the master from the inn. Mm, the one who came together with that human boy,” Ba He said calmly.

Hearing this, Magna was convinced and hurried forward two steps, clasped his hands and said, "Magna, City Lord of Huiyue City, pays respects to the master. Master, you have worked hard!"

His face wore a benign smile, appearing cordial.

Xia Ningshang briefly showed a hint of fluster, but quickly calmed and returned the salute with a light voice, "City Lord, you are too polite; I am unworthy of the title 'master.'"

Her voice was clear and pleasant, causing many yao to become entranced.

Such pristine beauty, a voice so lovely, and skillful in pill-refinement — for such a human, never mind the status differences between the human and yao clans, many would gladly risk their lives in pursuit.

Alas… as they looked at Yang Kai holding Xia Ningshang's small hand, jealousy poured from the yao as if they would rather transform into a thousand arrows and pierce Yang Kai to pieces to vent their hatred.

Xia Ningshang's modesty made Magna laugh heartily and he quickly said, "By the way, miss, let me introduce you — this is Ba He, the strongest expert below the Void King Realm in our yao ranks… yes, formerly the first general under Lady Chi Yue. Lord Ba He!"

"I pay respects to Senior Ba He." Xia Ningshang bowed again.

Ba He chuckled, "Miss, no need for such formality. To witness such an event is an honor for me, Ba He."

He also had favors to ask of Xia Ningshang and dared not show too much hauteur.

"This is the Young Son of the Thousand-Eyed Lord, Lord Mi Tian." Magna pointed to Mi Tian as he introduced him.

Mi Tian stepped forward with a refined manner, appearing polite: "Mi Tian is thrice fortunate to behold the lady's celestial visage."

Xia Ningshang merely nodded lightly and did not say much.

For some reason she felt a sense of wariness toward Mi Tian despite his perfect manners.

Yang Kai snickered coldly at her side.

"Miss, you were refining a Spiritual Pill the other day — did that Pill…" Magna looked at Xia Ningshang with eager expectation, wanting to know whether she had succeeded.

Ba He also turned his attention toward her.

Xia Ningshang's brows knit slightly as she glanced at Yang Kai.

She did not wish to display her hard-earned result to everyone.

"Show it — whether we can enter the palace depends on that Spiritual Pill," Yang Kai whispered in her ear; the intimate gesture made the Little Senior Sister tremble and her delicate earlobe flush pink.

Since Yang Kai urged it, she would not hide it; with a small motion a jade vial appeared in her palm.

Yang Kai took the jade vial and, without much inspection, tossed it to Ba He: "The pill is here, elder; you can take a careful look."

Ba He's expression grew serious; he gingerly pinched the jade vial, slowly opened the mouth, and a single Spiritual Pill rolled out.

When that Spiritual Pill came into view, Ba He could not help but cry out in astonishment, "Pill Cloud!"
