## Chapter 1825 — Return to Origin

“Then I must thank you, Senior,” Yang Kai clasped his fists slightly, eyes narrowing as he said coolly, “However… I choose neither.”

"You're courting death!" The figure's face darkened, murderous intent surging.

Although the figure scolded harshly, he did not show any intention of coming at Yang Kai; instead his gaze turned icy cold as he fixedly stared at him.

Yang Kai laughed loudly. "If that's the case, then why not see me out, sir?"

He put on a recklessly daring air, constantly goading the other.

The figure's face grew ever more sullen.

"What? You don't dare... or you cannot?" Yang Kai's eyes suddenly sharpened to a razor edge, as if a blade aimed straight into that figure's heart to see through his true and false.

The figure remained immovable as a mountain.

Yang Kai’s aura sank like an abyss as he sneered coldly, “If your true body were here, I’d probably stand no chance. I don’t know exactly how strong you are, but surely far beyond my current realm. Yet you think a mere wisp of Divine Sense can make me surrender? Are you an idiot? This is my Sea of Consciousness—here, I am the master!”

As the words fell, the calm sea below suddenly churned, gathering into savage columns of water that writhed like roused dragons, and an astonishing aura of murderous intent spread throughout the Sea of Consciousness.

The figure drew in a breath, inclining his head to Yang Kai with cool regard. "Kid, you truly are somewhat extraordinary; I underestimated you. Since you've seen through the trick, I have nothing more to say. Keep your life for now — I will come for you again; don't die so easily."

Saying so, he suddenly formed complex hand seals and his whole form gradually faded.

"Want to leave?" Yang Kai roared, "This old man's Sea of Consciousness is not a place you can come and go from at will!"

Golden light flared. Under the illumination of the World-Ending Demon Eye suspended above the Sea of Consciousness, a cataclysmic gold radiance swept toward the figure.

The fading silhouette abruptly stiffened, as if bound by that world-ending golden light.

The figure frowned, suspicious. "What power is this? How peculiar — disperse!"

His body trembled. The normally unstoppable world-ending golden light was directly shaken apart, scattering and retreating, unable to approach him any further.

Roar—roar—roar...

At that moment, dozens of ferocious dragons formed from Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness energy surged in from all directions, viciously lunging to bite the figure.

The figure's face took on an extremely grave expression; with his left hand he drew a semicircle before him, and a curtain-like protective shield suddenly materialized over his soul-body.

Rumble...

The feral dragons struck the barrier. The Sea of Consciousness world quaked, and Yang Kai's Spirit Body suddenly weakened extremely.

This was a direct clash of spirits; regardless of outcome, both Yang Kai and that figure would suffer tremendous damage.

Yang Kai was in a bad way, and the figure likewise suffered greatly — this was no ordinary Divine Sense attack, but a mutated fire-attribute Divine Sense power. Though he did not annihilate the opponent in that barrage, the scorching, soul-burning heat still made him suffer terribly.

After withstanding the dozens of dragon strikes, the figure became translucent, as if on the verge of collapse; within him one could faintly see searing fire-power roaming about, continuously devouring his soul force.

"Good, very good!" The figure ground his teeth as he glared at Yang Kai. "You insignificant ant, you dare wound my soul. I will remember this grudge — one day I will make you repay a hundredfold!"

With those words he again formed seals and his whole form completely faded away.

However, just before vanishing, Yang Kai vaguely saw him form a hand seal and fling it into his Sea of Consciousness.

After three breaths, the churning Sea of Consciousness gradually calmed.

Yang Kai stood with an iron-pale face, carefully sensing the surroundings — without a doubt that strange figure had gone, for not a trace of his aura remained.

However… what kind of seal had he left behind before departing? And where was it hidden? Yang Kai couldn’t sense the slightest trace of it.

A deep sense of powerlessness spread through Yang Kai's heart, making him extremely ill at ease.

The other was only a whisp of soul, perhaps one strand among his billions of Divine Sense threads, yet he could come and go freely within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness. Such a thing would be impossible even for a cultivator of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Could that guy possibly be on the same level as Yang Yan or the Insect Emperor?

One thing was certain: he and Yang Yan and the Insect Emperor came from the same place — that place was the Star Realm! It was a higher existence than the Star Domain in which Yang Kai dwelt.

Two other matters bothered Yang Kai. First, the figure had seemed particularly concerned with the Star Chart in his Sea of Consciousness — when he saw it he was even more excited than when he saw the Warm Spirit Lotus.

What secret did that Star Chart hide? Yang Kai could not fathom it.

Since obtaining the Star Chart he had only used it to determine direction and had not discovered any great purpose, yet the other valued it above the Warm Spirit Lotus; perhaps there was a hidden truth he did not yet know.

The second matter was the Warm Spirit Lotus itself.

The figure had said that if the Warm Spirit Lotus advanced one more step it could evolve into the Supreme Warm Spirit Lotus...

Yang Kai had always assumed the lotus's seven-colored form was its ultimate shape; never had he imagined there was a higher layer above it.

The benefit the Warm Spirit Lotus had bestowed upon Yang Kai was immense — the strength of his Divine Sense rivaled that of a Third Stage of the Void King Realm; all of it owed to this treasure's constant nurturing of his spirit.

The seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus had already given Yang Kai boundless gains; the thought of it advancing further set his heart ablaze.

After that exchange with the figure, the amount of information Yang Kai had absorbed was so vast that it took him quite a while to recover his senses.

Only after half a moment of time did Yang Kai dispel the many distracting thoughts, withdraw his Spirit Body, and return his Divine Sense to his physical body.

Glancing over, Mu Wu sat pale-faced and collapsed to one side, utterly motionless, as if his life vigor had withered after his cultivation had been ruined.

The several Origin Returning Realm warriors did not act rashly either; having witnessed Yang Kai ruin Mu Wu's abilities in a few moves, who dared to have any designs? They feared rousing Yang Kai's wrath and meeting death — even with Yang Kai standing there idly, none of them had the courage to flee.

Only when Yang Kai's gaze turned toward them did these Origin Returning Realm cultivators flinch and force out smiles more pitiful than tears.

"Young hero, please spare our lives; we were forced by Mu Wu, we had no choice, and only thus aided the wicked. We have seen the error of our ways. Beg you, give us a chance to live — from now on we will follow your lead, even if you send us into the mountain of blades or into the fires we will not refuse!" One of them hurriedly pleaded.

When he took the lead, the others continuously recited their hardships, accusing Mu Wu of tyranny and cruelty, endeavoring to distance themselves from the Devouring Spirit Sect, laying all blame on Mu Wu.

Pft...

Already weakened in vitality, Mu Wu coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood and died on the spot.

Yang Kai coldly watched their ugly faces; in an even fouler mood after that figure's visit, he had no patience to listen to their lies. Golden Blood Threads shot out, and in the dim space golden light flashed; their lives were cut off instantly.

Afterwards Yang Kai retrieved the Spatial Rings of these men one by one to inspect them, and from their rings he scavenged nearly a hundred already-refined Devouring Spirit Crystals.

He placed all the Devouring Spirit Crystals where the Stellar Origin had originally been, formed hand seals, and pointed forward with his finger.

Boom...

A muffled boom rang out as the Devouring Spirit Crystals all shattered, unleashing a surging, sea-like outpouring of Spiritual Qi that spread in all directions.

The energy within the Devouring Spirit Crystals came from the Tongxuan Continent; what Yang Kai had done was simply return that energy to its root. He believed that before long the homeland's Spiritual Qi density would improve.

After finishing this, he produced the Xuan Realm Pearl and once more dove into the Small Xuan Realm, having Xiaoxiao hold the Xuan Realm Pearl and return to the surface.

At the same time, on a Cultivation Star hundreds of millions of li away, in a valley thick with Spiritual Qi, a man sat cross-legged; he sat as if merged with heaven and earth, so that without using the naked eye even a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert would not spot him.

Butterflies danced about, and a small bird perched atop his head, smoothing its feathers with its beak.

To the little bird it seemed to be standing on an ordinary branch, not on a person's head.

This man’s comprehension of the Martial Dao’s profound intent had already surpassed the entire Star Domain, reaching the legendary realm of harmony with the Dao.

If the Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts were to see him, they would likely prostrate themselves in worship.

After a time the man stirred, suddenly opening his eyes and focusing on the distance.

Not long after, an almost imperceptible energy streak shot from afar and entered his body.

He closed his eyes and sensed it silently; after a moment his body trembled and he cried out, "Warm Spirit Lotus, Star Domain treasure map? Both of these are on one person? Does this child's fortune verge on heaven-defying? No matter — he dared to wound my soul; how could I spare him? I'll leave these two items with him for now. With my Soul-Seeking Seal present, even if he flees to the ends of the earth it will be useless."

Saying this, he slowly rose; a cruel light surfaced in his eyes. After a moment's thought he said, "So be it. A hundred years have passed and this Star Domain has shown no great energy fluctuations — it seems there truly is no guardian here. Fine, then let it become this one's stepping stone toward the imperial throne."

He laughed coldly and his whole body sank downward in a strange fashion.

In a short while he arrived deep within the planet's core and stood before the Stellar Origin of that Cultivation Star.

He waved his hands, continuously driving seals into the Stellar Origin; with his movements the entire Star's Spiritual Qi began to stir, converging toward the Stellar Origin and being swallowed by him like a whale swallowing the sea.

In that instant all the cultivators on the Cultivation Star sensed something amiss — they clearly felt the surrounding Spiritual Qi rapidly diminishing at a terrifying pace, and none of them knew the reason why.
