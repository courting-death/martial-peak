## Chapter 1527 — Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip

Lingjue Peak rose ten thousand zhang high, its summit layered with countless restrictions. As the forbidden ground of Star Emperor Mountain, its defenses were naturally impenetrable. The only way to reach it was on foot—flight was impossible. The flight-restricting grand array would make anyone who dared attempt to soar onto the peak suffer bitterly for it.

On a narrow mountain path, Yang Kai and Ye Xijun strode like arrows, swiftly climbing toward the peak.

A Void King-Grade warship was anchored halfway up the slope, ready to render aid at a moment’s notice.

A peak ten thousand zhang high was really no obstacle for the two of them; within roughly half an hour they had already reached the summit.

A fierce wind blew; their robes snapped and fluttered.

“Great Elder, someone has come to greet us.” Yang Kai’s gaze fixed on the elder and the middle‑aged man ahead, and he grinned.

Ye Xijun’s phoenix‑bright eyes narrowed; she looked at the elder with a complex expression and said in a low voice, “Qi Tianche!”

“Senior Sister Ye!” The old man smiled gently, his expression warm and soothing, like a spring breeze—carrying not the slightest trace of hostility. “This Junior Brother truly hadn’t expected that, with your temperament, there would come a day you’d return to Star Emperor Mountain.”

“There are many things you never imagined, Junior Brother Qi. Are you prepared?”

“Prepared for what, Senior Sister?” Qi Tianche smiled slightly.

“Prepared to fall and die here — I hope you’ve already arranged your affairs!” Ye Xijun snorted coldly.

“There’s no need for Senior Sister to bring up such matters. This Junior Brother has already made arrangements—my disciple is over there. No matter whether you die today or I do, he will see to it that the remains are properly buried.” Qi Tianche gestured to the side, where Leng Qing stood watching coldly. Hearing this, he gave a slight nod.

“In that case, this Senior Sister will send Junior Brother on his way.” Ye Xijun inclined her head lightly.

“Heh heh, this Junior Brother happens to think that Senior Sister’s chances of losing are much greater.”

With nothing left to say that the other would agree with, the moment the Senior Sister and Junior Brother met, they were already crossing blades with words—testing wills and trading barbs. Once their verbal exchange ended, the air grew instantly heavy. Both their expressions turned solemn as they locked eyes, each regarding the other as a lifelong nemesis.

Suddenly, their figures flashed and both vanished from where they stood.

When they reappeared, the two stood ten zhang apart from each other.

An indescribable force erupted from the two bodies, washing outward and enveloping the other.

In an instant, the surrounding space warped. That intangible energy almost condensed into substance, visible to the eye; within that area there seemed to be wondrous currents of power surging back and forth as the Senior Sister and Junior Brother fused and gathered their spiritual energies, colliding against one another.

Yang Kai’s eye twitched; Fang Peng’s mouth twitched—standing off to the side, Leng Qing’s own eyes widened.

The three were all shocked.

The Shi they displayed was of great accomplishment, already brushing the threshold of a Domain; both Ye Xijun and Qi Tianche had reached this level.

In their first clash, they were evenly matched!

Whether Ye Xijun or Qi Tianche, both showed astonishment — neither had expected the other to have achieved such attainments.

But soon both made moves; Ye Xijun produced the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp, a graceful hand forming a seal. One by one lamps of flame, each bearing world‑shattering might, hurled toward Qi Tianche, interspersed with strikes of wondrous secret techniques.

Qi Tianche would not be outdone. A golden wheel‑like secret treasure hovered over his head like a small sun. As it spun, dazzling rays of golden light shot forth, matching the power of the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp.

He chanted incantations and formed intricate hand seals, unleashing all he had learned through his life. The two traded blow for blow, the battle reaching a fever pitch.

Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel! Yang Kai glanced at the secret treasure Qi Tianche had called forth and his eyes brightened.

He recognized this Secret Treasure naturally because of Ye Xijun’s earlier explanation.

It was also one of the two remaining Void King-Grade secret treasures in Star Emperor Mountain, of extremely high grade, seemingly forged by an ancient emperor. It could absorb the essence of sun and moon, contain it within, and unleash that power at an enemy — its might was boundless.

The Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel had two forms; now it showed only the first, emitting the power of solar radiance — scorching and vigorous.

When it transformed into its second form it became a crescent moon, and the power released would be icy cold enough to freeze one’s spirit rigid.

In terms of sheer power, the Sun‑Moon Golden Wheel surpassed the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp. Yet secret treasures of greater might inevitably consumed more Saint Yuan to use — an undeniable fact.

Ye Xijun and Qi Tianche both stood at the very pinnacle of power among the cultivators of Dark Star. Even if there was a slight difference in the strength of their Secret Treasures, determining victory or defeat would not be something decided in a short time.

Yang Kai watched intently, then suddenly frowned, thrusting his hand forward; a Purple Shield flashed into being and took position to defend.

Boom—his body trembled slightly and his face darkened.

Looking up, he saw Fang Peng standing there with a cold sneer.

"Sect Master Fang, sneak attacks like that aren’t very honorable, are they? If you want a fight, just say the word—this Sect Master will accompany you," Yang Kai snorted.

“Enough talk. Since you trespassed onto Star Emperor Mountain, don’t expect to return alive. Today this place will be your grave!” Fang Peng roared.

Because of Yang Kai, he had been forced to abandon Leitai Sect’s millennia‑old foundation; he even tampered with ancestral matters in an attempt to bury Yang Kai with him. Now Yang Kai had appeared here unscathed, proving all Fang Peng’s prior schemes had been wasted — not only had he squandered Lei Feng Canyon as a great sect base, he’d also lost the lives of four Senior Uncles and Aunts.

As long as Yang Kai lived, there could be no Leitai Sect.

Only by killing him could the Leitai Sect hope to rise again.

“Old man, you’ve got some nerve wanting my life. If you want it, come and take it — I wonder if you have the ability!” Yang Kai snorted, summoning the artifact spirit Fire Bird.

A dragon’s roar rang out as well; the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade flashed green and, in the next moment, a jade‑green giant dragon soared into the air.

Hiss, hiss, hiss…

Space Blades formed around Yang Kai. Under his Divine Sense they coalesced into patterns and shot forth toward Fang Peng.

Fang Peng’s face changed. Although he had spoken arrogantly, he did not underestimate Yang Kai. Seeing Yang Kai deploy so many means, he dared not be lax.

Light flared around him as a magnificent, resplendent suit of armor appeared.

Before even attacking, he had already taken a defensive stance — in just the first exchange, Fang Peng’s movements revealed his lack of confidence.

At the same time his wrist flicked and a long whip suddenly appeared, exuding the distinctive aura of a Void King-Grade secret treasure.

As one of Dark Star’s two great powers, Leitai Sect naturally possessed treasures of such grade as an Ancestral Treasure; the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip was Leitai Sect’s heirloom for millennia.

Normally it was never to be used, but Fang Peng had taken it when he left Leitai Sect; now, facing Yang Kai, he did not hesitate to draw it.

That whip had been obtained by an ancestor of Leitai Sect while traveling in the world from some ancient ruin. It was famed even in antiquity. Its refinement consumed countless rare materials, and the spirits of seven powerful beast‑birds had been sealed within it, allowing it to manifest beastly forms.

Finally it was tempered in a ten‑thousand‑year Thunder‑Fire Pool, absorbing thunder‑and‑fire might.

Any secret treasure below Void King-Grade could not withstand its lashes; once touched by thunder‑fire, a treasure’s spiritual nature would be gravely damaged.

As the whip cracked, the thunder and wind sounded like detonations.

At that moment the Fire Bird lunged above Fang Peng, opening its beak to spit out gouts of flame the size of washbasins, which fell upon him.

Fang Peng, wielding a Void King-Grade secret treasure, showed no fear. With a brutal expression he lashed the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip at the Fire Bird.

A pitiful cry issued from the Fire Bird; it could not evade in time and was struck hard. Its flames dimmed as if wounded.

Yang Kai’s face changed, but he quickly composed himself.

By his sense the Fire Bird had been hurt but was not badly wounded; the injury had only stoked its ferocity.

A Space Blade struck before Fang Peng. Faced with such bizarre and unconventional power, he dared not take direct blade contact; with a flash he evaded, reappearing only ten zhang from Yang Kai.

The Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip carved a beautiful, treacherous arc and lashed toward Yang Kai.

Truly a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, and the head of a sect — in both strength and experience he surpassed ordinary warriors, especially in the purity and abundance of his Saint Yuan, which already leaned toward an advancement beyond the third stage.

Facing such a cunning attack, Yang Kai could only defend with his Purple Shield.

Yet the whip altered course midair with apparent sentience, avoiding the Purple Shield’s defensive arc. Fang Peng flicked his wrist and the whip snapped straight, striking like a spear aimed at Yang Kai’s heart.

On the whip a phantom of a beast‑bird manifested, its cry faintly audible.

It looked like an eagle but was not an eagle — its talons razor‑sharp, its wingspread over ten zhang, blotting out sky and light.

A Heavenly Roc!

Yang Kai looked on coldly, as if unaware that calamity loomed, offering no sign of evasion.

A lofty dragon’s roar sounded from the side; the jade‑green giant dragon shook its head and tail and charged to intercept the Heavenly Roc phantom. In the next moment they collided, dragon and bird cries pealing without respite as violent waves of energy rolled through the air.

The phantom of the Heavenly Roc dimmed at a speed visible to the naked eye, while the jade-green giant dragon grew fiercer the longer it fought, battering its foe until it was utterly routed, shrieking again and again.

“Impossible!” Fang Peng stared at the jade‑green giant dragon in shock, unable to accept it.

He knew Yang Kai’s jade‑green long sword was a fine secret treasure, but had never imagined it to be a Void King-Grade secret treasure!

If it were not, it could never match the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip, and the thunder‑fire that could corrode a treasure’s spirit had no effect on that jade‑green giant dragon; instead, Fang Peng’s own whip seemed to lose some of its sentience.

That jade‑green giant dragon was an existence of deadly venom!

Fang Peng’s expression changed drastically as he desperately drove Saint Yuan and Divine Sense.

The Heavenly Roc phantom vanished and the whip reformed like a living serpent, slithering free from the jade‑green dragon’s grasp and returning to Fang Peng’s hand.
