## Chapter 2618 — Make Way

As they spoke, Sha Yong and Gu Peng both lunged at Ji Yao, each reaching out a hand to grab her.

Ji Yao’s expression turned icy cold. With a crisp, clear note, her sword flashed—light gleaming, blood spraying in its wake.

Accompanied by two miserable screams, the two who had rushed over were sent flying back like arrows loosed from a bow, their faces deathly pale.

Pa! Pa!

Two severed arms fell to the ground.

"My arm!" Sha Yong stared at the severed limb on the ground, as if only now realizing he had lost an arm. He cried out in panic, and Gu Peng's face was no better.

"What the hell! With this level of cultivation, you dare jump out and seek death?" Yang Kai looked at the two with a face full of curiosity, completely baffled.

Earlier, these two had charged over menacingly, one after the man and one after the woman. Yang Kai had thought they were quite formidable, but now, with a sweep of his Divine Sense, he realized they were only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

"You two..." Gu Peng stared at Yang Kai and Ji Yao in utter shock. "How could you recover so quickly?"

Yang Kai frowned, not understanding what he meant at first, but then suddenly realized and smiled, "You thought we'd suffer some aftereffects from teleporting over?"

No matter how far the distance, spatial teleportation always leaves martial artists somewhat dizzy—these are the aftereffects of teleportation. In this state, a martial artist's reactions and senses become extremely sluggish, making it the easiest time for someone to launch a sneak attack.

That's why, in most cases, the Space Arrays in major cities are guarded by martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion. First, to protect the Space Array from being damaged, and second, to protect those who teleport in from being ambushed.

But the Space Array in this Black Armor City wasn't like that. It sat right in the city center, with no one guarding it. Instead, there were some people looking to make a quick fortune.

These people, Sha Yong and Gu Peng, wanted to take advantage of Yang Kai and Ji Yao's sluggishness after teleporting to launch a sneak attack, but they ended up kicking an iron plate instead.

Yang Kai was proficient in space powers. From the moment he started teleporting from the Netherworld Sect, he had already activated the Laws of Space to protect himself and Ji Yao. How could such a trivial teleportation affect him?

"Why is it like this?" Sha Yong was completely baffled, his face extremely ugly.

Yang Kai grinned, flashing a row of white teeth. "Because I'm just that good," he said lightly. But that smile sent chills down Sha Yong and Gu Peng's spines, leaving them both trembling with dread.

"Spare me, sir! Spare me!" The bearded man, Sha Yong, immediately began to beg for mercy.

Gu Peng, however, looked shifty. He turned to run away.

"Hmph!" Ji Yao snorted coldly. With a twist of her long sword, she threw it, turning it into a streak of sword light that shot toward Gu Peng. In an instant, it caught up to him, piercing straight through his heart. He collapsed to the ground, dead.

For someone at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm to deal with a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, Ji Yao didn't even need to use any real skill.

Seeing this, Sha Yong's face grew even paler. His legs trembled, and he wailed, "Please, sirs, spare this dog's life!"

Yang Kai looked at him indifferently and said coldly, "It seems you've done quite a few of these ambushes and robberies, haven't you?"

"No, no, this is my first time, really my first!" Sha Yong looked up, pitifully.

Yang Kai said, "If you walk by the river often, how can you not get your shoes wet? Since you chose this path, you should have been prepared. You're too young. Don't do this in your next life."

"Next life..." Sha Yong was stunned, his eyes full of terror. Before he could react, Ji Yao had already struck, smashing him into a pile of flesh.

All the martial artists around were silent as cicadas in winter. Staring at the beautiful yet cold woman who killed without batting an eye, each was filled with fear, worried she might go on a killing spree and turn this place upside down.

Yang Kai reached out and pulled over two Spatial Rings. He didn't even bother to check what was inside. The Spatial Rings of two Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artists were nothing to him. After all, he was now a wealthy man. Turning to Ji Yao, he said calmly, "Let's go."

Ji Yao nodded and flew out with him.

After leaving the Black Armor City, Yang Kai pointed in a direction and said, "Yao'er, that way should lead to the Northern Territory. Can you find the way back to Ice Heart Valley?"

Ji Yao nodded, "I can."

"Then you lead the way. Your master needs to cultivate for a while," Yang Kai instructed, tossing out his small wooden boat, landing on it, and calling out to Ji Yao.

Unexpectedly, Ji Yao glanced at the small wooden boat and said a bit embarrassedly, "Master, let's use my Secret Treasure instead. Yours... doesn't seem that great."

Yang Kai was left speechless.

That small wooden boat was something Jiu Feng had casually given him back in the day. It was of Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade quality. Yang Kai used to think it was pretty good, but now that he had broken through to the Emperor Realm, it no longer matched his status.

Ji Yao had clearly noticed the quality of the small wooden boat, which was why she said that.

Since she had something better, Yang Kai didn't refuse. He nodded and put away his small wooden boat to avoid embarrassment.

Ji Yao covered her mouth and smiled, seemingly aware of Yang Kai's thoughts. With a wave of her fair hand, a delicate Multi-deck Ship appeared before Yang Kai.

The Multi-deck Ship wasn't large, only about three zhang long, but it was exquisitely crafted, clearly the work of a master. The ship radiated a strong Spiritual Qi, making it obvious that it was an impressive Imperial Treasure!

Yang Kai hadn't expected that, despite Ji Yao's years of madness, she still had such a treasure on hand.

"Please, Master!" Ji Yao gestured invitingly.

Yang Kai put on a show of authority, grunted, and then stepped onto the Multi-deck Ship.

"Master, please find a room to rest. I'll handle the rest of the journey," Ji Yao volunteered.

"Alright." Yang Kai nodded, hands behind his back, walked into the cabin, found a room, and entered. Before he could even sit cross-legged, he felt the Multi-deck Ship tremble lightly, then shoot off like the wind.

Its speed was far superior to his small wooden boat.

Speed aside, the key was that the Multi-deck Ship was comfortable. Unlike his small wooden boat, where, if you didn't activate the protective barrier, the headwind would distort your face.

Looks like... he'll need to find a better Secret Treasure for travel, or else he won't even have a decent means of transportation in the future.

Actually, he still had the Bihai Shuttle, which was of high grade and brought out from the Jixu Secret Realm. But that thing was only good for traveling in deep seas. For regular travel, it was much worse—its speed probably couldn't even match his small wooden boat.

Collecting his thoughts, Yang Kai entered the Xuan Realm Pearl to take a look around.

Since his Incarnation had forcibly received Shi Huo's Origin last time, he had been in deep sleep, sitting there motionless. Who knew when he would fully fuse with Shi Huo's Origin?

He also checked the medicine garden and found that the Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines were all thriving. The more than a hundred thousand stalks of Imperial-Grade Spiritual Medicine he had obtained from the Wild Ancient Land were no longer losing potency.

The entire Small Xuan Realm was quiet, leaving Yang Kai feeling a bit lost.

Every time he came in before, there was Ruoxi, there was Liu Yan, there was Sister Hua...

Now, only the Incarnation remained, still in deep sleep. There wasn't even anyone to welcome him.

Shaking his head with a sigh, Yang Kai finally left the Small Xuan Realm.

Sitting upright in the cabin, Yang Kai took out a large number of Upper-Level Source Crystals, as well as some Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills he had refined last time. After swallowing them, he began to circulate his cultivation technique and entered closed-door cultivation.

Everything he had experienced in the Ancient Land, especially the sense of powerlessness when facing the Divine Spirit Shi Huo, made Yang Kai deeply aware of his thirst for strength.

Now that he finally had some free time, he couldn't wait to start cultivating.

In no time, the dense Spiritual Qi in the room almost became tangible, filling the entire cabin and being visibly absorbed into Yang Kai's body.

The energy contained in Upper-Level Source Crystals was immense, but even so, Yang Kai's consumption was terrifying.

Piles of Source Crystals turned to dust, and one Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pill after another was swallowed. Yang Kai's strength continued to grow.

Who knew how much time had passed when the Multi-deck Ship suddenly shuddered and came to a stop.

Disturbed, Yang Kai was startled out of his cultivation. He frowned, not knowing what had happened.

Before he could send out his Divine Sense to investigate, Ji Yao's icy voice came from outside: "Make way!"

As soon as she finished, an old voice responded, "Young lady, please be reasonable. Miss Xue Man seems to like your Multi-deck Ship very much. Would you be willing to part with it? Of course, the price will not disappoint you."

"Make way!" Ji Yao ignored him, replying coldly with just those two words.

The old voice seemed a bit displeased and said, "Young lady, why be so distant? Miss Xue Man wants your Multi-deck Ship for your own good. The Northern Territory hasn't been peaceful these past few years. Traveling around in such a fine ship is bound to attract attention. If you draw the eyes of evildoers, your fate could be grim."

"That's right, young lady. Helping others is helping yourself. The price will definitely satisfy you," a younger voice chimed in.

"What's going on?" Yang Kai asked as he walked out of the Multi-deck Ship and onto the deck, standing beside Ji Yao.

Looking up, he saw three people blocking their way ahead.

A man, a woman, and an old man.

The man and woman seemed to be a couple, standing close together. The man was handsome, the woman pretty—a golden couple, except their eyes ruined the impression.

The man stared at Ji Yao in amazement, his eyes glued to her, clearly captivated by her beauty.

The woman's gaze, however, held a trace of jealousy. Her big eyes kept darting over Ji Yao, realizing that no matter how she compared, she was far inferior. Her mood instantly soured.

Noticing her companion's lustful expression, the woman pinched him in annoyance, making the man cry out in pain.
