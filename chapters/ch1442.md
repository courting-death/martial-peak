## Chapter 1442 — Seven-Coloured Stag?

No matter what, the best course now was to find someone to probe the situation; at the very least he needed to understand what had happened. After all, others had entered ten days earlier than he had and might know things he did not. With that thought, Yang Kai took two Transmission Compasses from his Spatial Ring and poured his Divine Sense into them.

One of the two Transmission Compasses was for contacting Yang Yan, the other for contacting Qian Tong; both were items left from before and now happened to be useful.

As long as the distance between them wasn't too great, the two could establish contact.

After waiting a moment, Yang Kai put away the Transmission Compasses with a face of disappointment; neither Yang Yan nor Qian Tong responded. Clearly, even if they were in this place, they were too far from him to reach.

It looked like he would have to rely on himself.

He glanced left and right, picked a direction at random, and sped off that way.

Even without using his Star Shuttle, Yang Kai's speed now was extremely fast, yet he met no living person along the way.

However, Yang Kai did find many corpses and traces of battle here. Some corpses were of demonic beasts, some human, all gruesomely dead. It seemed the grassland had erupted in many great battles; judging by how dry the blood was, the fighting had ended not long ago — at the earliest on the day the Imperial Garden opened.

There were also many signs that Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines had been gathered on the grassland — it seemed quite a few people had benefited here!

Only after half a day did Yang Kai suddenly halt and look in one direction.

A hundred li away he could faintly hear the sounds of fighting, mixed with substantial ripples from colliding energies; clearly a dramatic scene was unfolding.

Yang Kai did not hesitate and immediately changed course toward it. He had now advanced to the Origin Returning Realm and had condensed his Shi to an extreme degree; even facing a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm he could put up a fight, so naturally he was bold.

A hundred li in distance, and in the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea he arrived. When Yang Kai drew near and saw what the battle was about, he could not help but raise an eyebrow and shout, "Seven-Colored Stag?"

Yang Kai's eyes nearly bulged out — he had not expected to see the famed Seven-Colored Stag here.

He could recognize that demonic beast because once, in the Sixth Stage of the Flowing Flame Sandland, he had obtained a Ten-Thousand-Year Incense; one of the main materials for making Ten-Thousand-Year Incense was the musk gland of the Seven-Colored Stag!

The benefits of Ten-Thousand-Year Incense need no explanation: when a warrior cultivates amidst its incense they can clear their mind and suppress inner demons. But the materials for making it are exceedingly rare; each is taken from the body of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast, and the musk gland of the Seven-Colored Stag is the hardest to obtain.

Because this demonic beast is a remnant of an ancient aberrant creature. Rumor has it they have long been extinct, so even if some great sects knew how to refine Ten-Thousand-Year Incense, they were still helpless without the raw materials.

And he had only just stepped into this strange place, yet he had already encountered a Seven-Colored Stag!

No — it seemed not to be a true Seven-Colored Stag! Yang Kai frowned again and watched the battlefield more closely. At first glance the beast looked much like a Seven-Colored Stag, but on closer inspection differences could be seen.

Rumor said a genuine Seven-Colored Stag is born as an Eighth-Tier demonic beast and can reach the Tenth-Tier at its peak. The one before him, though an adult, was clearly only at the peak of the Ninth-Tier, not yet Tenth-Tier.

Moreover, the seven-colored radiance on its body did not carry the same dread as the legends claimed.

A true Seven-Colored Stag's seven-colored radiance is its innate divine ability, with the miraculous effect of ignoring all defenses; even a Void King Realm warrior would have to back away three chi.

To slay a true Seven-Colored Stag would require several of the Void King Realm to join forces.

There were five people battling this Stag-like beast, three men and two women; their cultivation levels were all at the Origin Returning Realm, spanning the First, Second and Third Stages. The Secret Treasures they brought forth were also unpredictable and powerful.

Even so, the five did not dare take the slightest risk; two of them looked especially disheveled, clearly having suffered hard losses at the beast's hands.

All manner of martial skills and Secret Treasures' powers rained down on the beast, but it remained unmoved. Its beast eyes showed a humanlike contempt, and the seven-colored radiance flared, actually blocking every attack.

After the energy collisions, the beast was unharmed; instead, the five, after fighting for a long while, were exhausted of their Saint Yuan and were panting.

Yang Kai's arrival had not been stealthy, and the five were all greatly surprised — in a place like this the worst thing is being ambushed from behind.

But when their Divine Sense swept over Yang Kai and found he was only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, they all relaxed.

The weakest among them was also at that level; with the presence of those at the Second and Third Stages, they naturally did not take Yang Kai seriously. After exchanging a glance, a middle-aged man split off part of his mind to watch Yang Kai's movements while the others continued to besiege the beast.

Yang Kai naturally understood their approach, but he felt no resentment; put in their place he would have done the same — nothing worth fretting over.

Yet Yang Kai's frown deepened further.

Because he discovered that he did not recognize any of the five!

Although Yang Kai had not had many dealings with other forces' warriors on Dark Star, during the opening of the Imperial Garden he had been outside refining his Shi; in other words, he had seen most of the warriors who passed by him to enter the Imperial Garden.

But among these five, there was not a single familiar face.

What surprised Yang Kai most was that the clothing the five wore differed somewhat from the fashions on Dark Star, as if they were not from Dark Star at all.

That thought sent Yang Kai into a haze of doubt.

But he had only come to gather information and had no intention of intervening or causing trouble; he only planned to wait for the five's battle to end before approaching to speak.

The battle continued; after half an hour the five all displayed disappointment and signs of retreat. The reason was clear: that Stag-like demonic beast was extremely troublesome. The seven-colored glow covering its body had some unknown quality that made it exceedingly sturdy; no matter how the five attacked, they could not break it.

Moreover, the beast's occasional counterattacks were razor-sharp. By this point the five had sustained varying wounds; the worst-off, a black-haired elder, had his abdomen pierced with blood gushing. Though not yet fatal, if the fight dragged on the wound would only worsen and their combat effectiveness would steadily decay.

"Brother Min, why don't we withdraw for now and plan from a distance?" another white-haired elder asked with a frown.

Everyone could see it was no longer feasible; not only could they not deal with the beast in a short time, but the open terrain here risked someone taking advantage should they be drawn out — the spoils might be claimed by another.

After all, Yang Kai had already tracked the battle's sound to this spot.

The wounded black-haired elder was not obstinate and nodded, "Fine, we fall back for now!"

With the two strongest elders agreeing, the remaining middle-aged man and two women naturally had no objection.

The five all made a feint and immediately withdrew from the battle circle, dashing off like the wind.

Whether by design or accident, the direction they fled was precisely where Yang Kai stood.

It seemed they intended to use him as a brief buffer to stall the beast.

Yang Kai frowned and instantly saw through their plan; although displeased, he did not show it.

"Go quickly!" One of the five, a girl in tight black attire, small and delicate and appearing only seventeen or eighteen years old, shouted at him as she passed.

Among the five she was the weakest in cultivation, the same as Yang Kai at First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. It was unclear what method she cultivated; her strength was not weak and her youthful appearance was unchanged.

Taking it as goodwill, Yang Kai grinned and asked, "You are abandoning the beast, then?"

The girl briefly furrowed her brows but had no time to answer; in an instant she was a hundred zhang away, and after a few more flickers of movement she was far off.

As the five fled, the beast became ferocious, letting out a deer-like cry. Its four hooves moved and it suddenly turned into a stream of seven-colored light, chasing in the direction the five had fled.

Its speed was like lightning, almost impossible to catch with the naked eye.

During the charge a filament of seven-colored radiance separated from its body and shot straight toward Yang Kai.

Facing such a beast, Yang Kai did not dare be careless; he reached out and a Purple Shield stood before him. The next instant the seven-colored radiance struck the Purple Shield.

Without a sound!

To Yang Kai's astonishment, his Purple Shield did not fully defend him; the seven-colored radiance treated the shield as nothing, pierced through it, and barreled toward his chest.

Yet the shield itself was completely undamaged.

Could there really be a technique that ignored defenses? Yang Kai was stunned and briefly wondered if his eyes fooled him — could this truly be the supposedly extinct Seven-Colored Stag?

But he quickly dismissed the notion; although the radiance had pierced his Purple Shield, its power had been greatly reduced and it no longer carried that terrifying force it had upon being released.

If it were a genuine Seven-Colored Stag's radiance, it would never behave like this!

Thus, even if this beast was not a true Seven-Colored Stag, it bore some blood relation to that ancient aberrant species.

A lucky find! Yang Kai, rather than being alarmed, was delighted. With a flick he dodged the radiance and snapped his fingers; a Space Blade shot forth like lightning toward the beast.

The beast had seemingly not taken Yang Kai seriously, thinking a single strike could finish it and showing no defense, but when the Space Blade neared it realized the mistake.

By then it was too late to dodge; the pitch-black Space Blade sliced across its body, and the seven-colored glow trembled, splitting open a small wound!

The defense the five had been unable to break had been breached by Yang Kai's blow!

After all, the Space Blade was one of Yang Kai's trump cards, capable of banishing things into the void; its power could not be measured by ordinary logic.
