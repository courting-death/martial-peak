## Chapter 2079 — Resist

Kang Siran had languished at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm for several hundred years; without the aid of a Dao Origin Pill, he could never have advanced in his lifetime. The Dao Origin Pill with pill patterns that Yang Kai possessed was truly timely relief.

Because of Kang Siran, Yang Kai had gained great benefits beneath Primordial Cauldron Mountain; at that auction the same day, Kang Siran was even willing to lend him a few million Source Crystals. Yang Kai remembered that debt of favor, so he did not hesitate to give the Dao Origin Pill to Kang Siran.

If others honored him a chi, he would honor them a zhang in return; Yang Kai had never been a stingy man.

Although Mo Xiaoqi was also at the peak of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and a Dao Origin Pill might allow her to advance to the next Stage in a short time, her situation differed from Kang Siran's.

Mo Xiaoqi was young yet possessed such cultivation and a mysterious, extraordinary background; whether she truly needed a Dao Origin Pill or not, she likely had the means to obtain one herself.

Using a Dao Origin Pill to break through to the next Realm might not greatly affect a martial artist at the moment, but it could influence their future prospects.

Therefore any martial artist, unless driven by necessity, would avoid relying on pills to break through. Yang Kai himself had not taken a Dao Origin Pill when he broke into the Dao Origin Realm, for that very reason.

When Yang Kai emerged from the dwelling, not only was Mo Xiaoqi at his side, but the Zhang Family’s old matron and that beautiful woman also came out.

The two did not wish to hide away inside the dwelling and wait to die; after all, there were other Zhang Family descendants here, and if the city truly fell the Zhang Family would be exterminated. So despite Yang Kai's persuasion, the old matron and the beauty insisted on going out to meet the enemy and contribute to defending the city.

Yang Kai had no choice but to acquiesce.

Fortunately, although the two were not very powerful, they were both at the First Stage of the Void King Realm and not too weak; if they merely helped the city's guards on the walls maintain the defensive formations, there would be no major problem.

A streak of light wrapped the four of them and sped through Fenglin City; before long, they reached a certain section of the city wall.

Looking out, beyond the walls was utter darkness, endless Demonic Qi seething and writhing like a living thing, chilling to the bone. From it came wails and howls that seemed to scrape at painful memories deep within people, forcing every martial artist to circulate their own energy in resistance.

On the wall, Duan Yuanshan was distributing Qingxin Jade; any martial artist who came to the wall to help defend the city could take a piece to guard against the unexpected.

Seeing Yang Kai arrive, Duan Yuanshan brightened and hurriedly called out, "Brother Yang, this way!"

Yang Kai shifted his posture, bringing Mo Xiaoqi and the two Zhang Family women before Duan Yuanshan; he glanced at the situation outside and saw that although the Demonic Qi was fierce, for the moment Fenglin City seemed largely unharmed. On every section of the wall there were numerous martial artists—some maintaining defensive formations, others unleashing Martial Skills to strike at the points where the Demonic Qi surged.

"City Lord, if there is anything you need, just order," Yang Kai cupped his fist and said.

"Since you say so, I will not stand on ceremony. The number of Dao Origin Realm experts in the city is small—counting you it is not even ten. The others have each taken a section of wall to defend. For now we can hold for a day or two, but do not let down your guard. You have no special task; go where support is needed," Duan Yuanshan said gravely.

"Very well!" Yang Kai nodded.

Duan Yuanshan hurriedly produced a Transmission Compass and handed it to Yang Kai, saying, "Take this; if anyone needs support they will transmit through it—please come immediately to aid!"

Yang Kai took it and did not put it into his Spatial Ring, instead tucking it into his bosom.

He looked at Mo Xiaoqi and the two Zhang Family women and said, "You stay here and follow City Lord Duan's orders; I'll go look around."

With that, he became a streak of light and patrolled along the wall.

On the walls countless Fenglin City martial artists fought with all their might; most were of Void King Realm level, fighting in groups or alone, and whenever exhausted they would step down to be relieved by others.

Yang Kai scouted for a while and found that the situation was fairly good.

After the initial panic and helplessness, Fenglin City's martial artists steadied their minds and no longer sought to flee; they truly stood united to resist the Demonic Qi.

The radiance of many Martial Skills struck into the rolling Demonic Qi and was quickly extinguished, but with Yang Kai's keen Divine Sense he could detect that the Demonic Qi had been worn down somewhat.

One person's efforts to erode it are but a drop in the bucket; yet if a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand… even a hundred thousand all did the same, the result would be utterly different.

Whenever the outer Demonic Qi attempted a surge, powerful Secret Techniques or Martial Skills would meet it and scatter that seemingly impenetrable qi.

Yang Kai tried it himself and found it was indeed a crude method for relieving a city besieged by Demonic Qi.

However, the Demonic Qi contained extremely corrosive power, so ordinary martial artists dared not deploy Secret Treasures and could only rely on their own Secret Techniques and Martial Skills to attack.

For a time Fenglin City felt almost impregnable; this greatly cheered the fighters on the wall and boosted morale, and they somewhat underestimated the Demonic Qi, thinking it no great matter.

Time passed slowly.

After being besieged by Demonic Qi for a day, Fenglin City had not suffered any casualties.

This abnormal phenomenon put Yang Kai on high alert, for earlier in that mine pit he had personally experienced the terror of that ancient Demonic Qi; though he had not faced it head-on, the violent will it emitted was not to be underestimated.

The Transmission Compass relayed the messages of the Dao Origin Realm experts, so even while scattered they could clearly perceive one another's situations.

At dawn the next day, the Demonic Qi enveloping the city seemed to be coordinated and withdrew more than ten zhang, leaving a circular blank area outside the wall.

The sight caused the warriors on the wall to erupt into earth-shattering cheers.

They believed they had successfully driven back the Demonic Qi and could not help celebrating.

Even a few Dao Origin Realm experts thought so.

"Do not be careless!" Duan Yuanshan warned over the Transmission Compass, his tone grave.

At a point on the wall, Yang Kai hovered in the air, squinting ahead. Although he was a Dao Origin Realm expert with excellent sight, this was the darkest moment before dawn and the rolling Demonic Qi prevented him from seeing far.

Suddenly the ground trembled slightly and a muffled thunder rolled, seeming to come from far off and advancing toward the wall at great speed.

The sound began subtle, almost imperceptible, but as time passed it grew increasingly distinct.

The cheering on the wall abruptly stopped; the warriors exchanged glances and a sense of unease rose in them.

Yang Kai drew a deep breath and closed his eyes. When he opened them again his left eye had become a golden light and his pupil a terrifying vertical slit.

The World-Ending Demon Eye, capable of piercing falsehood!

From his left eye, an infinite gaze pierced the void, probing into the very depths of the Demonic Qi...

The next moment his expression changed and he barked to the nearby warriors, "Quickly strengthen the formation's power!"

At the same time his Divine Sense surged and he poured a thought into the Transmission Compass, transmitting to the other Dao Origin Realm experts: "Large numbers of demonized beasts and human martial artists are approaching—be careful!"

In his vision, within the rolling boundless Demonic Qi, agile figures were rapidly charging this way; there were traces of Demonic Beasts as well as human silhouettes.

Those beasts were grotesque and unknown in origin, their bodies radiating overwhelming wickedness.

Those humans, once corrupted by the Demonic Qi, were equally uncanny — their auras warped and the power of their qi and blood surged to a terrifying, overflowing intensity.

Though the cultivations of the beasts and humans varied, their numbers were terrifying—approaching from all directions, countless, almost encircling the entire Fenglin City.

Nearby warriors hearing Yang Kai's shout hesitated no longer and hurriedly channeled their power into the city's defensive formation.

With a hum the formation's light curtain abruptly brightened.

The reason the fighters obeyed so readily was plain: that day Yang Kai had displayed the power of a Dao Origin Realm expert, and when a Dao Origin Realm practitioner speaks, ordinary martial artists rarely dare to question him.

In the next moment Duan Yuanshan's order also came through the Transmission Compass.

Instantly the city's defensive formations were driven to their utmost, light flashing until the area by the wall was almost daylight.

Rumbling...

The Demonic Qi that had withdrawn more than ten zhang surged again like a tsunami, raising towering waves and crashing toward the wall.

Hissing sounds rose.

The Demonic Qi was blocked by the defensive light curtain, continuously corroding its strength and emitting teeth-grinding sounds.

This was a scene the warriors on the wall had faced countless times; casting caution to the wind, they drove their power to the limit and poured their Qi into the defensive formation.

But in the next moment figures suddenly used the cover of the pitch-black Demonic Qi to burst forth.

One by one grotesque demonized beasts appeared, their eyes black, tinged with crimson, and humans shrouded in black mist—apparitions manifesting in the defenders' sight.

Impacts rang out.

Closing in, the demonized beasts unleashed their innate divine powers and multicolored beast techniques bloomed; the corrupted humans retained their former abilities and even employed Secret Treasures to fiercely assault the defensive light.

The defensive light curtain sank inward like a balloon and then rebounded, but the glow representing defensive strength quickly dimmed.

Everyone was horrified!
