## Chapter 1593 — Not My Business

When word spread that a martial artist at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm had actually managed to walk out of the Domain whirlpool unharmed, the Void King Realm experts inside the stone pavilion immediately erupted in uproar.

In an instant they perceived that this Origin Returning Realm fighter possessed unimaginable potential.

“Heh heh, about this little one... this old woman has already reserved him for the Sword Alliance,” the old crone said with a light chuckle. “If he can walk out of the Blood Prison alive, I’ll immediately take him back to the Sword Alliance’s main star and nurture him with full support.”

“Senior Sister Lei, have you lost your wits?” a middle-aged man dressed like a scholar scoffed. “You claim him with one sentence — shouldn’t you first consult the rest of us here? A seedling like this, the Hengluo Commerce Guild would hardly give up.”

“Purple Star wants him too.” The beautiful woman interjected.

“I don’t care. If he truly comes out alive, I only want that one person; the rest is up to you.” The old woman put on an air of seniority, her expression resolute.

“Senior Sister Lei, you can’t decide this on your own. Setting aside where he came from or whether he has a powerful backer, even if he has none, are you sure he’ll follow you? Maybe he favors the Hengluo Commerce Guild — after all, in the Star Domain the Hengluo Commerce Guild has a higher reputation than the Sword Alliance.” The middle-aged man was not to be outdone and mocked coldly.

“Reputation-wise, our three houses aren’t that far apart, are they?” The beauty pursed her lips and smiled, feigning disagreement. “Maybe he’d prefer Purple Star.”

The old woman snorted coldly, her expression ill-tempered. “You two — must you fight me for that little fellow?”

“It’s not that we want to fight you; Senior Sister Lei is just a bit unreasonable.” The middle-aged man shook his head slowly.

“Enough, stop arguing!” Luo Hai frowned and cut them off. “Whether that kid can come out alive is still unknown — what are you three shouting about? Maybe he just got lucky this time and escaped the Domain whirlpool; maybe he can’t hold out and dies in there. If that happens and you’re still quarreling here, won’t you make yourselves a laughingstock?”

At Luo Hai’s words, the three paled somewhat and then nodded.

The old woman said, “Lord Luo Hai, please keep an eye on the child’s movements. If he does die in there, inform us so that we may abandon our hopes.”

“I will do my best.” Luo Hai inclined his head lightly.

“Thank you very much, Lord Luo Hai.” The old woman hurried to offer her thanks.

Calm returned to the stone pavilion.

Inside the Blood Prison, Yang Kai picked up the Spatial Ring from the ground, gathered his Shi around his body, and strode forward.

The terrifying Domain whirlpool could not hinder him in the slightest; he cut through it like a scythe through withered reeds, unstoppable. Yang Kai easily broke free of the whirlpool’s influence.

Several days of confrontation and contemplation left Yang Kai feeling that his Shi had grown noticeably; his understanding and control of Shi had deepened another layer.

This was a reward unattainable through mere seated cultivation and bitter training.

The Blood Prison truly was a fine place!

Standing in place, Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense through Xu Dingyang’s Spatial Ring, then silently retracted it.

There was nothing in Xu Dingyang’s Spatial Ring to make Yang Kai’s eyes light up. Although, given Xu Dingyang’s Origin Returning Realm status, his wealth was already astonishing, Yang Kai’s standards were high and he was unmoved by mere riches.

As for the task Xu Dingyang entrusted him with before his death, Yang Kai paid it no mind.

They were strangers who happened to cross paths; Yang Kai had no obligation. He would not go out of his way to notify Qingyu Sect on Chi Lan Star for a stranger.

He’ll handle it if fate ever brings the chance.

He raised his head to orient himself and strode onward.

The Blood Prison differed from places Yang Kai had trained in before. Whether it was the Flowing Flame Sandland on Dark Star or the Imperial Garden in the Great Emperor’s detached residence, those spaces were vast and heavily restricted, so even when many entered them, encounters were rare.

The Blood Prison was different.

Although sprawling, the Blood Prison had existed for tens of thousands of years and, owing to its fame, had attracted countless Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts from across the Star Domain. As a result, Yang Kai frequently ran into strangers along his journey.

Most people didn’t look for trouble; sensing a stranger’s aura, they would avoid them to prevent conflict.

But when they detected that Yang Kai was only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, astonishment turned to scorn, and they looked toward him with pitiful, condescending eyes as if he were about to die at any moment.

Yang Kai naturally paid them no heed.

He had witnessed life-and-death struggles between martial artists a few times.

The major forces in the Star Domain were far from harmonious; many harbored friction and grudges, and when they met inside the Blood Prison, a disagreement could quickly turn into a full fight.

Yang Kai didn’t get involved; he was searching for Domain whirlpools, hoping to gain greater benefits and further refine his Shi.

His caution bought him peace. Since entering the Blood Prison, half a month had passed without him clashing with others. He had encountered three whirlpools of considerable power, risked himself to enter each trial, and emerged safely each time with abundant gains.

His Shi was growing with terrifying speed; he had clearly surpassed the minor-achievement stage and was pressing toward true mastery.

To his disappointment, he still hadn’t found the Blood Prison’s specialty — Domain Stone.

The birth of Domain Stones is inseparable from the existence of Domains. Domain powers lingering in the Blood Prison for countless years were absorbed by peculiar jade and stone there, and through endless change over the years, special objects called Domain Stones were formed.

Therefore Domain Stones are generally found within Domain whirlpools; to obtain a Domain Stone, one must venture into a Domain whirlpool.

Wherever there are Domain Stones, there will be a Domain whirlpool.

Yang Kai felt his luck had been poor.

One day, while seeking Domain whirlpools, he suddenly heard a sharp tearing sound of space approaching from the distance.

Yang Kai frowned and immediately knew he was likely about to witness another clash.

He instinctively wanted to avoid it, but when his Divine Sense swept that way he gave a small startled sound and stopped, gazing that way with suspicion.

He detected a familiar life aura coming toward them.

The martial artist hurrying over evidently noticed Yang Kai’s presence and accelerated, barreling straight toward him.

In moments, a rainbow of light entered Yang Kai’s sight; within ten breaths it shot before him, revealing a graceful yet disheveled figure.

“You?” Yang Kai frowned, astonished.

She turned out to be Xue Sun, who had set out from Di Chen Star with him and hailed from the Fierce Crab Domain.

Now her aura was chaotic, she bore some wounds, and her green dress was splashed red — whether with her blood or her enemies’ he couldn’t tell — as she fell before Yang Kai, gasping; her ample bosom heaved exaggeratedly as she looked at him with complex eyes.

She herself hadn’t expected to find this one human standing here whom she had only met once.

She had merely thought the aura felt familiar and hoped to find aid.

“You look a mess — wounded?” Yang Kai appraised her up and down.

“Don’t be sarcastic, I’m being chased.” Xue Sun replied coldly, not particularly warm. “Help me.”

Yang Kai glanced behind her; two figures were rapidly approaching, murderous intent in their eyes.

“Why should I? This isn’t my business.” Yang Kai frowned. Had he known it was Xue Sun approaching, he would have fled long ago.

A helpless look flashed through Xue Sun’s beautiful eyes as she bit her lip and said, “Believe it or not, I’m on good terms with Sister Qingluo.”

“That still doesn’t concern me.” Yang Kai laughed lightly. If she thought invoking Shan Qingluo would make him chivalrous, she was mistaken. “You’ve got it wrong; I’m only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. You’d be better off running — those two are almost upon you. If you don’t flee now it may be too late.”

“You’re no ordinary Second Stage cultivator—I know what you did back in the palace. You defeated Xue Lian; you’re no weaker than us!” Xue Sun clearly wasn’t willing to give up the ally before her.

Yang Kai still shook his head. “Miss, your situation isn’t that dire, is it? With your strength, even if you can’t beat the two of them, escape should be possible. Why drag me into it?”

He had judged that very thing; that was why he was reluctant to intervene.

Xue Sun’s insistence made him resistant; he felt used.

“Escape may be possible,” Xue Sun replied haughtily, “but I’m a yao. If I blatantly flee inside the Blood Prison and human experts notice, they may pursue and surround me. Running would only make my situation worse.”

“That’s true.” Yang Kai was taken aback — he hadn’t considered that angle.

“Kill one of them for me, and I’ll handle the other myself.” Xue Sun stared at Yang Kai and said in a low voice, “Consider it a favor I owe you.”

“Forget favors — what tangible benefit is there?” Yang Kai asked casually, surveying her and letting his eyes linger a moment on her ample bosom.

A look of disgust flashed across Xue Sun’s eyes; she turned slightly as if to hide it and asked coldly, “What do you want?”

“Not what I want — what do you have?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

Xue Sun’s brows tightened and hesitation flickered across her fair face. Seeing the two pursuers drawing nearer, she grit her teeth and said, “I found Domain Stones but didn’t have time to take them. I can take you there.”

“Domain Stones?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he immediately nodded. “Deal!”

Seeing how mercenary he was, Xue Sun’s disgust deepened.

She truly couldn’t understand why proud Shan Qingluo favored such a man. After returning she planned to advise Sister Qingluo to avoid men like him who might derail her future.
