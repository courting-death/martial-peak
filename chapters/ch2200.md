## Chapter 2200 — Is There No Law?

The nameless valley remained as desolate as ever, its Spiritual Qi depleted. The oval-shaped light gate stood suspended in midair, and from time to time, cultivators emerged from it—some beaming with joy, clearly having gained much in the Four Seasons Land, others crestfallen, apparently dissatisfied with their harvest.

Regardless of their previous expressions, the moment they crossed the exit’s light gate, everyone’s face changed dramatically, their bodies turning cold as sweat poured down their foreheads.

The reason was simple: at this moment, six Emperor Realm experts stood in a row, each staring intently at the exit. Whenever someone emerged, six waves of Emperor Realm Divine Sense swept over them simultaneously.

Who could withstand such pressure?

Fortunately, the six Emperor Realm masters bore no ill will and were only probing, so the pressure came and went quickly, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Many didn’t know what these six experts were doing. After leaving the exit, they slunk off to the side, but the more perceptive had already guessed why the experts were stationed there.

And so, the six Emperor Realm experts stared at the exit, not moving their gaze for more than half a day.

At one moment, a figure flashed out from the long-silent light gate.

The six Emperor Realm masters immediately turned their eyes toward him.

The figure was caught off guard, but his reaction was quick. He mobilized his Origin Qi and Divine Sense to resist the pressure, then frowned in confusion—realizing the pressure came from elders of the various sects ahead.

“Good, good, good!” Chen Wenhao looked at Wuchang, who had just emerged from the Four Seasons Land, and kept repeating the word ‘good’ with a smile. “Wuchang, step aside for now.”

Upon hearing this, Wuchang’s eyes flashed thoughtfully, and he moved to stand off to the side.

Following Wuchang, three more figures appeared—it was Xia Sheng and the other two from Qingyang Shrine.

As soon as he appeared, Xia Sheng, drenched in sweat, said, “Honored seniors… what’s going on here? Could it be… you’re here to welcome us? What have I done to deserve this…?”

"If you keep babbling, this Lord will throw you back in!" Xiao Yuyang snorted coldly.

Xia Sheng shrank back and dared not make another sound, quickly dragging Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao aside.

After these three came out, about ten breaths later, Yang Kai’s figure finally appeared at the exit.

Gao Xueting couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief and whispered, “He’s finally out.”

“This is the one?” Xiao Yuyang turned to Gao Xueting and asked.

Gao Xueting nodded lightly.

“Excellent!” Xiao Yuyang laughed loudly. “You’ve made this Lord wait so long. I want to see if this kid really has three heads and six arms!”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand, directly covering Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had barely found his footing when a tremendous binding force descended upon him. The power was so overwhelming that he couldn’t even muster the thought of resistance. In an instant, he was immobilized and yanked forward, landing right in front of Xiao Yuyang.

“What’s going on?” Yang Kai cried out, his face filled with shock.

He thought he was being ambushed!

Looking up, he saw six Emperor Realm experts staring at him with burning eyes, like six lechers eyeing a naked maiden.

Even Gao Xueting was no exception.

Yang Kai recognized all six—Gao Xueting and Xiao Yuyang went without saying, and the other four he had also seen in Fenglin City.

After a brief moment of thought, Yang Kai more or less understood the situation before him.

Although he had been mentally prepared, he still felt powerless now that the moment had come.

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai shouted.

“Don’t be afraid, you won’t be harmed,” Gao Xueting comforted him.

“Let’s talk this out! Gentlemen use words, not fists. It’s better to resolve enmity than to create it. Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west—don’t bully the young and poor!” Yang Kai rambled on!

“Noisy brat!” Xiao Yuyang snorted coldly and reached out to grab Yang Kai.

Before Yang Kai could react, his Spatial Ring was snatched away.

“Robbery?” Yang Kai was stunned, glaring at Xiao Yuyang. “Bullying the weak, oppressing the young—is there no law anymore?”

“Hm?” Xiao Yuyang’s Divine Sense swept through Yang Kai’s Spatial Ring, but it didn’t distract him. Just a disdainful snort from his nose made Yang Kai’s aura shrink. He sneered, “Law? Here, this Lord is the law. Do you have a problem with that?”

“If that’s how you want it, my lord…” Yang Kai shrugged helplessly. “There’s nothing I can do.”

“Good!” After saying this, Xiao Yuyang ignored Yang Kai and focused on his search.

A moment later, he frowned and tossed the ring to Feng Ming beside him.

Feng Ming took it and began searching in the same way…

At this point, Xiao Yuyang turned his gaze back to Yang Kai. His eyes were unfathomable, like a demonic abyss, making it impossible to meet his gaze. It was as if he wanted to peer into Yang Kai’s very soul and dig out his deepest secrets.

Being stared at made Yang Kai extremely uncomfortable, as if millions of ants crawled under his skin.

However, Yang Kai had previously faced the awe-inspiring might of a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, and had even crossed hands with three First Stage Emperor Realm experts before. For Xiao Yuyang to think he could subdue Yang Kai’s will with a mere stare was a bit presumptuous.

Of course, it wasn’t Xiao Yuyang’s fault. Normally, a First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator would have lost all composure under such a stare, answering any question asked. But Yang Kai had weathered many storms.

“Kid, this Lord sees you’re clever. You should know why we’re waiting here, right?” Xiao Yuyang didn’t beat around the bush and asked directly.

“I have a guess…” At this point, Yang Kai couldn’t play dumb and could only answer this way. After speaking, he glanced timidly at Xiao Yuyang. “It’s for the Supreme Mystic Pill, isn’t it?”

“As long as you know!” Xiao Yuyang barked.

They were waiting here, naturally, for the Supreme Mystic Pill.

The cultivators who had come out of the Four Seasons Land earlier had already spread the news that the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus had appeared and that Yang Kai had refined it into pills.

Upon hearing this, Xiao Yuyang and the others were naturally shocked.

The Supreme Mystic Pill was a heaven-defying Spiritual Pill. If used well, a single Supreme Mystic Pill could create an Emperor Realm expert.

This was a matter of great importance. If they hadn’t feared damaging the exit’s light gate by barging into the Four Seasons Land, they would have rushed in long ago, not giving Yang Kai any time to make deals.

Having waited here all this time, now that they finally saw Yang Kai, they had to get to the bottom of things.

“Where are the extra Supreme Mystic Pills? Hand them over!” Xiao Yuyang demanded, reaching out to Yang Kai.

“What extra? They’re all gone.” Yang Kai cried out innocently.

“Hm?” Xiao Yuyang put on his imposing air again, his voice cold. “You should know you’re weak. If you lie, this Lord will see through it, understand?”

“I’m telling the truth. If you don’t believe me, ask Brother Wuchang and Brother Xia!” Yang Kai pointed.

Wuchang and Xia Sheng both twitched slightly at this.

Although they were rising stars of the Dao Origin Realm and would surely reach the Emperor Realm in time, compared to an old Emperor Realm master like Xiao Yuyang, there was still a huge gap. Now that Yang Kai was shifting the trouble to them, the pressure was immense.

“Very well.” Xiao Yuyang said in a deep voice, “I’ll ask, and you answer honestly. If you dare lie, I’ll send you back into the Four Seasons Land to stay there for life!”

As he spoke, he pointed at the still-open light gate.

Then, his tone softened, and he smiled. “Of course, if you cooperate, riches and glory… will be yours!”

Yang Kai wiped the sweat from his forehead and said, “So it’s a stick and a carrot… Heh, Lord Xiao, ask whatever you want. I’ll answer everything I know.”

“Good.” Xiao Yuyang looked satisfied and asked, “That Supreme Mystic Pill… was it really refined by you?”

“It happened in front of everyone. How could I fake it?” Yang Kai said proudly. “If you don’t believe me, you can ask Her Highness the Princess. She can vouch for me.”

“I did ask, but this Lord still can’t believe you’re a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist…” Xiao Yuyang said in disbelief. After a pause, he continued, “Forget it, let’s not dwell on that. How many Supreme Mystic Pills did you refine in total?”

“Four!”

“Where did they all go?”

“Princess Lan Xun ate one, a female disciple of the Eight Directions Sect ate one, I ate one myself… and the last one went to Brother Wuchang.”

“Oh?” At this, Chen Wenhao raised his eyebrows in surprise and looked at Wuchang.

Wuchang nodded slightly to him.

Chen Wenhao immediately forced a smile, his features twisting awkwardly as he chuckled, “Lord Xiao, Wuchang obtaining a Supreme Mystic Pill is his own fortune, after all. Please, be magnanimous, Lord Xiao… Hehehe…”

Xiao Yuyang glanced at him but ignored him, turning to Yang Kai. “So, according to you, there isn’t a single Supreme Mystic Pill left?”

Yang Kai said awkwardly, “Lord Xiao, refining that batch of Supreme Mystic Pills took all my effort. I almost failed, and getting four pills in the end was a stroke of luck. What more do you want?” After a moment’s thought, he added, “After refining, all the pills were in my furnace, and the trades were made in full view of everyone. All the pills have indeed been used up. Lord Xiao, you checked my Spatial Ring earlier and didn’t find anything, right?”

Xiao Yuyang nodded lightly. “That’s right. Getting four pills with your ability is already impressive. Even an Imperial-Grade Alchemist might not be able to refine many Supreme Mystic Pills. Since the whereabouts of the pills are clear, there’s nothing more to say.”
