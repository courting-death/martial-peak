## Chapter 2539 — Ghost King

Old Ban heard this and gave a bitter smile. "Safe? This is only the beginning of the disaster!"

Yang Kai's expression changed, and he said in a low voice, "Could it be that the falling thunder..."

Old Ban shook his head. "You don't need to worry about the falling thunder anymore. The thunder tide has already passed, and for the next month, there won't be such a dense barrage of thunder. Now, we only need to guard against one thing... the howling wind!"

Back in the Desolate City, Pi San had warned Yang Kai that there were three dangers in the passage into the Ancient Land: the strange mist, the falling thunder, and the howling wind.

The strange mist goes without saying, as it fills the passage all year round. Anyone unfamiliar with the path can easily get lost in it. Yang Kai had already witnessed the terrifying power of the falling thunder. Even with his Divine Sense stronger than the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, it was severed in an instant by the thunder, showing just how brutal its destructive force was.

Since the howling wind is listed alongside the strange mist and the falling thunder, it clearly can't be underestimated either.

Moreover, Old Ban's face was extremely grave at this moment, making Yang Kai feel even more uneasy.

"How powerful is this howling wind?" Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

Old Ban replied, "In terms of sheer destructive power, the falling thunder is stronger. But anyone familiar with this passage would rather face the thunder than encounter the howling wind."

"Why is that?" Zhang Ruoxi asked, looking puzzled.

Old Ban gave a bitter smile. "Because the howling wind is relentless. Its killing power may not match the thunder, but it lasts much longer. Where the howling wind passes, it's like the sharpest Secret Treasure slicing through, not only stripping the flesh from a martial artist but even shaking their Divine Soul. If you stay in it too long, you'll die a truly miserable death."

Zhang Ruoxi shivered involuntarily at his words.

From Old Ban's explanation, being struck by the howling wind is like being cut by a dull knife. The most terrifying part is that it can even shake the Divine Soul.

Old Ban said solemnly, "After the thunder tide, there will be a howling wind, sweeping through the entire passage. If we can't find a suitable place to hide within the time it takes to burn an incense stick, we'll surely die."

"A howling wind!" Yang Kai's face darkened. Though it was his first time hearing the term, he could imagine the scene. He quickly asked, "Is there anywhere nearby to take shelter from the wind?"

Old Ban looked around and said in a deep voice, "Earlier, I was so focused on avoiding the thunder that I lost my way. This place feels very unfamiliar. But if I'm not mistaken, we should be near the center of the passage."

"The center..." Zhang Ruoxi frowned, then her expression changed. "Old Ban, didn't you say that the center of the passage has..."

She hadn't finished speaking when, in the far distance, two crimson lights suddenly appeared. The thick strange mist in the passage couldn't block their glow, and the three of them saw it clearly.

An extremely icy chill suddenly spread out. That sinister intent enveloped Old Ban and Zhang Ruoxi, making their hands and feet cold and their bodies shiver.

"Ah..." Zhang Ruoxi couldn't help but cry out.

She realized that the two crimson lights were actually a pair of terrifying eyes. Those eyes were filled with unimaginable ferocity, as if forged from blood. Just one glance sent her mind reeling in terror.

"Ghost King!" Yang Kai shouted, his gaze unwavering as he faced the crimson lights. His vast Divine Soul power surged forth, transforming into a pure Divine Soul attack aimed directly at them.

After a silent clash, Yang Kai's body swayed, his face turning slightly pale.

The distant crimson lights suddenly flared even brighter, their power not diminished but increased, pressing forward as if to crush Yang Kai to dust.

In an instant, Yang Kai's mind was thrown into chaos. He felt as if he'd fallen into the Nine Nether Purgatory, surrounded by clawing little ghosts, their mouths emitting strange cries as they lunged to seize him, eager to devour his flesh and drink his blood.

Each little ghost was hideous and terrifying, their faces twisted in malice.

"World-Ending Demon Eye!" Yang Kai no longer dared to hold back. His right eye instantly turned golden, a majestic vertical pupil appearing. From that golden eye, a strange power spread out, instantly dispelling the illusions in his mind and steadying his spirit.

Not only that, but a peculiar attraction emanated from his right eye, as if it had become a bottomless abyss, trying to draw the Ghost King's gaze into it, never to escape.

In his Sea of Consciousness, the Warm Spirit Lotus shone with seven-colored light, waves of coolness filling his Sea of Consciousness completely.

"Hmph!" From deep within the strange mist came a cold snort. The Ghost King seemed enraged by Yang Kai's counterattack. Instantly, the surrounding winds grew fierce, the chill intensified, and the ground turned to frozen earth.

Amidst wailing cries, translucent ghostly claws emerged from the ground, reaching for the trio's ankles.

The change happened in a flash. Old Ban and Zhang Ruoxi, lacking the strength, fell into a dazed state after the Ghost King's snort, staring blankly ahead without any other reaction.

Yang Kai raised his hand, lifting the two from where they stood, and shouted, "Ghost King, we're only fleeing the thunder tide and passing through by chance. We mean no disturbance. Please show us some mercy."

"Jie jie..." An extremely harsh laugh echoed all around, making it impossible to tell where it came from. At the same time, the two crimson lights in the mist vanished.

The Ghost King disappeared without a trace.

The sinister wind surged, and even the strange mist began to flow. The ghostly beings that had vanished during the thunder tide reappeared, lurking in the mist and circling the trio, waiting for an opportunity. The ghostly claws reaching from the ground grew more solid, constantly grabbing at Yang Kai, but were blocked by his protective Emperor Yuan, producing hissing sounds.

Yang Kai's gaze swept around, fixing on a direction in the mist. He snorted coldly, "Ghost King, enjoy your freedom, but don't bring disaster upon yourself!"

At these words, the Ghost King seemed thoroughly enraged. A massive ghostly claw suddenly reached out from the depths of the mist, descending like a mountain, slamming toward Yang Kai's position. Its sharpness was extreme, as if it could tear space apart.

"Give you an inch and you want a li!"

Yang Kai's Divine Sense surged, and a stream of light shot from his mind, not to meet the ghostly claw, but blasting in another direction. In midair, the light transformed into a long blade, its momentum unstoppable, shattering the sky.

Soul-Severing Blade, a strike to break the heavens!

The attack flashed by, and from deep within the mist came a shrill, miserable scream.

At the same time, the massive ghostly claw that nearly struck Yang Kai vanished, and the countless ghostly hands rising from the ground disappeared as well.

The ghostly beings gathered around paused, then shrieked and scattered like birds and beasts.

In the blink of an eye, everything returned to normal. It was utterly silent, as if no battle had ever taken place here.

Yang Kai knew that if he hadn't shown his strength at the last moment, the Ghost King wouldn't have retreated so easily.

Moreover, even with his Soul-Severing Blade empowered by his Divine Soul and Imperial Treasure, he hadn't managed to injure the Ghost King much, which he found incredible.

This Ghost King, hidden deep within the strange mist, truly wasn't easy to deal with.

If Yang Kai hadn't been wary of it, he wouldn't have bothered with so many words. But in such a peculiar environment, he really didn't want to fight.

Once the Ghost King left, Zhang Ruoxi and Old Ban woke up together. Both clearly remembered what had just happened, their hearts still pounding and faces pale.

"There's no time, let's go!" Old Ban didn't ask why the Ghost King had retreated, just urged them forward and led the way.

The howling wind was about to arrive. If they couldn't find shelter before it came, no matter how they struggled, death was inevitable.

Old Ban kept observing the terrain, occasionally changing direction.

At first, he seemed hesitant, unsure if he was heading the right way. But after a while, his speed suddenly increased, and he no longer needed to deliberate.

Seeing this, Yang Kai knew he'd found the right path.

After all, he was very familiar with this place. Even if he got lost occasionally, he could always return to the correct route.

The time it takes to burn an incense stick was almost up, and a gentle breeze began to blow through the passage. Though not strong, it stung the skin like a knife.

If even a gentle breeze was like this, what would the howling wind be like?

Both Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi knew Old Ban was right. The howling wind was even more terrifying than the falling thunder. The thunder, though unpredictable, at least had safe spots during the tide. But when the howling wind came, the entire passage was dangerous, with nowhere safe.

The wind grew louder and stronger. Yang Kai, tough and highly cultivated, was fine, but Zhang Ruoxi and Old Ban had to activate their protective Origin Qi to withstand the howling wind.

"Over there!" Old Ban suddenly seemed to spot something, pointed excitedly, and sped up, calling out as he ran, "Hopefully there's still room!"

Yang Kai hadn't understood what he meant by 'room' when Old Ban suddenly darted into a spot.

He led Zhang Ruoxi in after him, and they discovered that Old Ban had brought them to a mountain cave to shelter from the wind.

Strangely, once inside the cave, everything returned to normal. Their vision cleared, and even the strange mist was gone, with only the faint sound of wind howling at the entrance.

The cave was about five or six zhang across, enough to fit about ten people.

Before Yang Kai and the others arrived, five or six martial artists were already sheltering here. Clearly, they knew about the howling wind and had found a safe haven early, waiting for it to pass.
