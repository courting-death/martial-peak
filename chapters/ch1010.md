## Chapter 1010 — Provocation

Yue Xi strode straight up to Yang Kai, her phoenix eyes radiating authority. She looked down at him coldly, her beautiful face filled with hostility.

Yang Kai frowned, a little unsure why her attitude had turned like this. She had misunderstood him before, but she had never brimmed with enmity.

Yet now, she looked as if she couldn’t wait to kill him on the spot.

This left Yang Kai perplexed. He had no idea how he had offended her this time.

“You killed Wei Wu?” Yue Xi suddenly spoke.

“What did you say?” Yang Kai’s gaze flickered as he feigned calm.

“You think I don’t know?” Yue Xi sneered coldly. “Wei Wu was killed by your hand—just half an hour ago!”

Yang Kai was startled and at once realized this beautiful woman must have some special means to sense what had just happened, or perhaps Wei Wu had sent her a message before he died.

However, Yang Kai hadn’t seen Wei Wu take out the message-transmitting Secret Treasure compass before his death, so the former possibility was great.

He immediately understood why Yue Xi harbored hostility toward him.

“Why exactly did you kill him? And what underhanded trick did you use to manage it?” Yue Xi demanded sternly.

“He brought it on himself—his death isn’t worth pitying!” Yang Kai snorted lightly.

“Why would he make trouble for you?” Yue Xi pressed on. “You and he had no grievance or feud.”

“You might as well ask him. I’d like to know too.”

“Fine, just you wait. If there comes a day we can leave this place, I’ll definitely have your life in payment!” Yue Xi ground out through clenched teeth, her delicate body trembling, her inner fury laid bare. She clearly believed Yang Kai had taken advantage of Wei Wu’s guard being down and succeeded with a sneak attack; otherwise, with Wei Wu’s strength, he should have been able to easily and completely defeat Yang Kai.

With her disciple dying miserably, Yue Xi, as the master, naturally had to avenge him.

“Those who threaten me never meet a good end!” Yang Kai flared at once, his mood stifled and sullen.

Truth be told, he could have gotten along well with the people of Sword Alliance. After all, he had shown favor to He Miao before; so long as Yue Xi had a shred of gratitude, things wouldn’t have become this rigid.

At their very first meeting, this beautiful woman had wanted to probe Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness. Though she might have been acting out of caution then—afraid he was a Purple Star spy—it had still left Yang Kai quite displeased.

What happened afterwards only made relations between both sides grow more and more strained, to the point of being irreparable now.

Yang Kai had killed Wei Wu. Whatever the reason, Yue Xi would never let the matter rest.

“I’d like to see just what kind of end awaits me,” Yue Xi said evenly, her silver teeth clenched. “Let’s hope you don’t disappoint me!”

Yang Kai bared his teeth in a grin and suddenly said with obscene malice, “A beauty like you—your best end is to be violated to death!”

Yue Xi’s pretty face went cold, her delicate body trembling even more violently, and an icy killing intent burst out in her beautiful eyes.

She seemed unable to suppress the rage in her heart and was about to make a move on Yang Kai.

“You’ve never tasted a man before?” Reading her expression, Yang Kai curled his lips into a crooked, wicked smile and continued to provoke viciously, “Very good, very good. I’ll make up for your regret—before you die, I’ll make you a true woman!”

At this moment, he was the very picture of a brazen, shameless rogue—an utterly shameless villain.

Yue Xi’s killing intent grew thicker still. Her face turned unsightly to the extreme, power surging through her body as her fists clenched tight. Suddenly, she closed her beautiful eyes, drew in a deep breath, and forced her anger down.

She knew that making a move in front of that mysterious old man was fated to end badly; she might be killed before she could slay Yang Kai.

“You’re trying to goad me into striking you?” Yue Xi opened her eyes again and bit out in a lovely shout, “Junior, you’ll pay for today’s wild words!”

No man had ever humiliated her with such teasing words—especially not a young man who didn’t even know how much younger he was than her. The anger in Yue Xi’s heart was nearly uncontrollable.

Fortunately, she saw through Yang Kai’s intent in time and didn’t let his scheme succeed.

Saying so, Yue Xi turned on her heel and left, no longer willing to look at Yang Kai’s ugly face. She feared that if she lost control even a little, she would really make a move on him.

Watching Yue Xi’s quickly departing back, Yang Kai let out a frivolous whistle. His gaze roamed over the curve of her waist, the cleft of her hips, and her thighs—utterly wanton, burning hot like fire.

Under that kind of gaze, Yue Xi couldn’t help getting goosebumps. Her heart blazed with fury, and her resolve to kill Yang Kai only grew firmer.

Only when she went far away did the teasing light in Yang Kai’s eyes flash with a trace of concealed regret.

He had indeed meant to provoke Yue Xi into attacking—since things had already reached a point of no return, striking first was naturally the wiser move. But to his disappointment, Yue Xi actually swallowed her anger and held herself back.

She was enduring now, but the next time she erupted, it would only be even more violent than this moment.

Yang Kai sighed inwardly, feeling a headache coming on.

This clash over here did not escape the notice of the others.

Lü Guichen of Purple Star had been watching all along. After Yue Xi left, he even smiled with narrowed eyes and gave Yang Kai a thumbs-up, an expression of “nicely done” on his face.

Bi Ya covered her mouth and giggled, casting sultry glances toward Yang Kai again and again. “Who would’ve thought you’re such a rogue? This elder sister suddenly finds herself liking you a little.”

“I like you too,” Yang Kai grinned at her.

Bi Ya’s body trembled with laughter, her tone half-playful, half-reproachful. “Full of lies—who’d ever believe you!”

“Master, are you all right?” Elsewhere, He Zao looked at the pale-faced Yue Xi and asked softly.

“I’m fine.” Yue Xi drew a deep breath; her full, tender chest nearly burst from her clothes. In a low voice she said, “You’ve seen his ugly face clearly, yes? Don’t approach him again. If there’s a chance, kill him for your Master and avenge your Senior Brother!”

He Zao pursed her lips and nodded obediently. “Yes!”

He Miao frowned, and the look she cast toward Yang Kai also changed in flavor.

She trusted her Master’s words completely and took them to be Yang Kai’s true face. To dare tease even her Master in front of the crowd, and even flirt with Purple Star’s Bi Ya, made her feel intense disgust.

She secretly felt she had misjudged him before, having thought Yang Kai was a thoroughly good man.

The minor disturbance gradually subsided. As time passed, more and more cultivators arrived here.

After about another hour, Shen Tu suddenly appeared.

He glanced around, quickly came to Yang Kai’s side, and, sensing the power fluctuations emanating from him, his eyes lit up as he exclaimed, “You succeeded?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Congratulations! I didn’t think you’d really pull it off. Looks like this brother underestimated you!” Shen Tu offered sincere congratulations, happy for Yang Kai’s recovery of strength, his words earnest.

“Lucky. What have you gained during this time?”

“A huge haul.” Shen Tu’s eyes shone with essence. Smiling proudly, he patted the Spatial Pouch on his chest and said, “They’re basically all Saint King-Grade and Origin-Grade herbs—there are even Void King-Grade ones. You have no idea how abundant the resources in this damned place are. Compared to these, what we collected before was all trash.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help being moved. “Void King-Grade?”

“The top-tier herbs!” Shen Tu laughed heartily. “I’m rich this time. If I can find an Alchemist to refine these into Pills, at least up until my breakthrough to the Saint King Realm I won’t have to worry about Pills at all.”

Speaking of this, his expression turned a bit bitter. “But if I alone gained so much, the people of Purple Star and Sword Alliance must have harvested even more. Damn it, I really want to kill them all.”

He looked indignant, as if those people had snatched things that were his by right.

“By the way, brother, you came earlier—do you know why that senior summoned us here?” Shen Tu asked again.

“No idea.” Yang Kai shook his head. After spending some time with Shen Tu, he was used to the man’s endless chatter, so he never interrupted. Only when asked did he reply now: “So you were indeed summoned here by him?”

“Yeah. I was searching for herbs when this senior’s voice sounded in my ear. Otherwise, who would dare come here?” As Shen Tu spoke, his face suddenly grew solemn. “Everyone here was scattered to the corners of the continent, yet he could transmit to all with his Divine Sense. He really is an expert of the Void King Realm without a doubt. I truly don’t know what his background is.”

In the entire Hengluo Star Domain, there weren’t many at the Void King Realm. Each and every one was at the Star Lord level—a Lord or Lady who kept to themselves and held a revered status.

“It isn’t only us who are curious. The Sword Alliance and Purple Star people are curious too. Just wait—everything will come to light sooner or later.”

The two immediately fell silent and watched the surroundings coldly.

At this moment, most gazes were gathered on that old man, watching him shuttle about busily over there—seeing him shift the Saint Crystals’ positions and set out the structure of a grand array. Everyone was at a loss, not knowing what he intended to do.

Even Lü Guichen and Yue Xi couldn’t tell what effect that grand array would have. Its complexity and intricacy had already exceeded their comprehension.

They did see, however, that the door-shaped construct was refined from pieces of the previous warship.

Only after a full half day did the old man suddenly stop what he was doing. He sent out his Divine Sense to feel through the array, then threw his head back and laughed wildly, “It’s done—hahaha, it’s finally done!”

His laughter rolled like thunder, deafening to the ears, making everyone’s Qi and blood churn as their faces changed dramatically.

The old man’s mood seemed exceedingly good; his face was full of joy and excitement.

A moment later, he restrained his laughter and cast his gaze toward the place where the crowd had gathered.

“Mm. You’ve been here for some days now. I know you have many questions. I had no time to bother with you before, but now I can answer your doubts. Does anyone want to ask anything?” He looked all around, his gaze sweeping across each face in turn.

“Senior, may I ask what this place is?” Lü Guichen clasped his fist in salute and asked respectfully.

“That I truly do not know,” the old man said. “I only know this is a Dark Star—one hidden within the Chaos Abyss!”

“A Dark Star?” Quite a few people cried out in shock, their faces suddenly turning fervent. It seemed those two words held unparalleled allure for them, stirring each of their hearts to excitement.
