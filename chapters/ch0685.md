## Chapter 685 — Looking for Me for Something?

In the forbidden area where the Divine Cult of Leiguang and the Wind Eye were located, a tremendous explosion suddenly rang out. Immediately after, the energy of heaven and earth became chaotic, and nearly all the disciples of Leiguang sensed the anomaly, unable to contain their astonishment as they turned to see what had occurred.

Soon after, a violent gale blew in from the direction of the forbidden area, causing trees to sway and houses to collapse. Within a radius of fifty li, the foundation of the Divine Cult of Leiguang lay in ruins.

Many of the powerful figures of Leiguang turned pale, their limbs turning icy.

Those in the forbidden area were equally stunned, feeling the destruction wrought by the explosive force of heaven and earth, all of them cultivating their techniques to resist the impact.

The power erupting from the Wind Eye not only included visible and sharp attacks but also an invisible soul-snatching wind.

This was the power stored within the Wind Eye, but at this moment, it erupted outward unexpectedly.

A group of several individuals, close to the Wind Eye, had no idea that disaster was descending upon them.

Duan Hai and Xu Qi were momentarily taken aback, both letting out shrill cries as the soul-snatching wind surged into their minds, causing their Sea of Consciousness to roil, leaving them disoriented and dizzy.

Xia Chengyin dared not be the slightest bit careless, employing his own methods to resist the damage caused by the soul-snatching wind to his spirit.

Cang Yan was preparing to protect Elder Du and Mi Na during their retreat when he saw Elder Du, calm and unhurried, take out a piece of blue stone. Holding the blue stone in his hand, he infused it with True Yuan, and soon, a blue light barrier took shape.

“Cang Yan, come in!” Elder Du called out.

Cang Yan quickly darted into the light barrier. Once he stepped within the protective range of the barrier, the pressure on his spirit suddenly vanished.

“Lianqing Stone?” Cang Yan’s eyes brightened as he recognized the name of the blue stone. “Elder Du, impressive resources!”

“Now isn’t the time for that,” Elder Du said with a wry smile. “The wind blades are coming.”

Cang Yan nodded lightly, not daring to slack off, and hurriedly gathered his strength to deflect the oncoming wind blades.

He understood that the blue light barrier activated by the Lianqing Stone could only resist attacks on the spirit and provided no defense against tangible assaults.

He had only heard of the Lianqing Stone in rumors, knowing that it was incredibly valuable, a product from the starry sky. It could defend against the Divine Sense attacks of those in the Saint Realm, meaning that possessing such a miraculous stone would allow one to avoid damage to their spirit.

However, this thing was fragile and could easily shatter, turning to dust after just a few uses.

Elder Du producing it at this moment was out of necessity; he was a Saint-Grade alchemist but was not a powerful figure in the Saint Realm himself, having only reached the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm. He had been deeply immersed in alchemical techniques for years, neglecting to cultivate, leaving his combat power nearly on par with the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm.

“Elder Du!” Xia Chengyin shouted urgently as he approached.

Elder Du frowned but nodded lightly, increasing the output of his power, causing the light barrier formed by the Lianqing Stone to expand, barely allowing Xia Chengyin to squeeze inside.

The two powerful figures at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm joined forces, shielding Elder Du and Mi Na behind them, as all incoming wind blades were deflected.

Duan Hai and Xu Qi, disoriented and dizzy from the soul-snatching wind, twisted about like headless flies within the explosive force of the wind, soon covered in injuries and bleeding. Xia Chengyin, seeing this, became anxious and called out, “Elder Du, can you let them in as well?”

“I’m powerless at this point. If I increase my output, the stone is likely to shatter,” Elder Du slowly shook his head.

Realizing that Elder Du was not just making excuses, Xia Chengyin sighed in despair.

Duan Hai and Xu Qi were elders within his Divine Cult, and he could not bear seeing them perish like this. Hiding behind the barrier of the Lianqing Stone, Xia Chengyin could only do his best to protect them, deflecting the wind blades that aimed for them and continuously shouting to awaken their consciousness.

But it had no effect. The power that should have remained hidden within the Wind Eye had suddenly erupted. Duan Hai and Xu Qi, both at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm, were unable to withstand it. In just a brief moment, they fell into a pool of blood. Although they were still alive, prolonged exposure to the soul-snatching wind would inevitably cause their spirits to be blown away.

Xia Chengyin felt anxious but had no measures left.

Suddenly, after a wave of even more violent attacks hit, everything fell eerily silent, as if the preceding eruption had been the final power of the Wind Eye.

The Lianqing Stone in Elder Du’s hand completed its mission at that moment, shattering and slipping between his fingers.

“Yang Kai!” Mi Na suddenly exclaimed with joy, pointing towards the void with her delicate finger.

Everyone's spirits lifted as they looked up, only to see Yang Kai standing in the air, completely naked and covered in blood, his expression indifferent, yet exuding a disconcerting energy from his body.

Cang Yan’s pupils contracted slightly, and he couldn't help but grin silently.

Yang Kai’s appearance matched the vague image in his mind, meaning the person the ancestor wanted him to find was indeed him!

“Where’s the Wind Eye?” Xia Chengyin was stunned to find that the Wind Eye, which had existed in the Divine Cult of Leiguang for countless years, had inexplicably vanished.

Moreover, there was not a trace of wind attribute energy left in this place.

This realization made Xia Chengyin's face turn ashen.

The Wind Eye was of great value to Leiguang. Without it, it meant that disciples practicing wind attribute techniques and martial skills would no longer be able to receive assistance from this place, and they could no longer comprehend the mysteries of wind here.

“You pervert, can’t you put some clothes on?” Mi Na cupped her hands near her mouth, her face flushed as she looked Yang Kai up and down, shouting loudly.

As if hearing her words, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and turned to look over.

His brows slightly furrowed as he noticed the four people standing there. Aside from Elder Du and Mi Na, he did not recognize the other two.

Yet it was undeniable that these two exerted even more pressure on him than Duan Hai and Xu Qi.

The corner of his eye suddenly caught sight of Duan Hai and Xu Qi moaning on the ground in a pool of blood, and Yang Kai grinned menacingly.

His form flickered, and Yang Kai suddenly appeared beside Duan Hai and Xu Qi at a speed several times faster than before.

“So fast!” Cang Yan and Xia Chengyin couldn’t help but cry out in shock. In that instant, they seemed to sense a sudden spirit of agility—the very essence of the wind. Even with their strength, they nearly lost sight of Yang Kai’s figure.

Before his words faded, Yang Kai casually struck out, landing a direct hit on Duan Hai's neck.

With a cracking sound, blood spurted out as Duan Hai’s head flew off.

Xia Chengyin nearly went mad.

Staring blankly at the head flying through the air, displaying a pained expression, he found himself unable to comprehend that this guest, who had been invited to serve as an honored guest, had actually killed his Grand Elder of Leiguang.

Moreover, he hadn’t even given a greeting.

“Oh?” Cang Yan chuckled somewhat mysteriously, his eyes fixed on Yang Kai, licking his lips as he suddenly realized that this kid, whom the ancestor had asked him to find, quite suited his temperament.

Just as Yang Kai, filled with killing intent, was about to strike at the defenseless Xu Qi, Xia Chengyin roared, “You brat, how dare you!”

As he spoke, he charged toward Yang Kai like lightning.

Regardless, he could not allow Yang Kai to kill two Elders right under his nose.

Cang Yan chuckled wickedly as he moved, arriving first to block Xia Chengyin’s path.

“Cang Yan, what do you mean?” Xia Chengyin glared at Cang Yan, coldly questioning. Though they were both at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, he had no certainty of victory against Cang Yan.

“It’s nothing, but if you wish to harm him, you’ll have to ask me first,” Cang Yan said indifferently.

“He has nothing to do with your Tianxiao Sect, does he? Cang Yan, don’t you dare bully me!” Xia Chengyin's face twisted, shouting somewhat hysterically.

“Young friend, please show mercy!” Du Wan hurriedly called out, rushing toward Yang Kai with Mi Na.

Hearing Elder Du’s shout, Yang Kai's brow furrowed as he checked Xu Qi's condition, his heart settling as he chose not to continue the killing.

Soon, Elder Du and Mi Na arrived at Yang Kai's side, Elder Du letting out a gentle breath, looking at Yang Kai with complex emotions.

During their time at the Alchemists' Association, Yang Kai had left a good impression on him, not appearing as someone who would act recklessly, but he was uncertain why this person had suddenly turned against the two Elders of Leiguang.

“Elder Du,” Yang Kai greeted calmly, nodding to Mi Na.

Mi Na's neck flushed red, glancing at Yang Kai before pouting and averting her gaze.

Yang Kai paid no mind, instead fixing his gaze on Cang Yan. He was unsure why this person was helping him, as he had no memory of this individual, and there was naturally no connection between them.

While observing, he took out a set of clothing and began to put them on with steady motions.

Xia Chengyin also ceased his argument with Cang Yan, instead focusing on Yang Kai with a glare. Though this might be a rare talent, the fact remained that his Grand Elder had died at Yang Kai's hands; no matter what, he had to seek justice for Duan Hai.

“Young friend, what exactly happened? If it’s convenient, could you explain it to me?” Elder Du inquired gravely.

“These two intended to harm me and threw me into the Wind Eye to extract my soul,” Yang Kai explained indifferently.

“Nonsense. As far as I know, you are an honored guest invited back by Duan Hai. Why would he conspire with Xu Qi to harm you?” Xia Chengyin clearly could not accept this explanation.

For no reason at all, how could two powerful figures at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm target a young man?

“Who are you?” Yang Kai coldly stared at him, sensing the hostility and resentment from the other.

Elder Du coughed gently, “This is Xia Chengyin, the leader of the Divine Cult of Leiguang!”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, understanding, and then turned to Cang Yan. “What about this one?”

“Tianxiao Sect, Cang Yan!” Cang Yan stepped forward to introduce himself.

“We seem unfamiliar with each other, don’t we?” Yang Kai smiled amiably at him, his attitude neither warm nor cold.

“Unfamiliar,” Cang Yan smiled slightly. “But I have something to discuss with you.”

“You have something to discuss with me?” Yang Kai’s expression turned playful as he glanced at Du Wan, who immediately assured him, “Cang Yan means you no harm; I can guarantee that!”

“Then we’ll talk later,” Yang Kai nodded toward Cang Yan.
