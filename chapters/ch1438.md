## Chapter 1438 — A Once-in-a-Thousand-Years Opportunity

Not only within the Lingxiao Sect, but all the martial artists across Dark Star now fixed their gaze on the same spot.

The Imperial Garden!

At this moment the Imperial Garden rolled with brilliant colors that dazzled the eye, floating silently in the sky at an unknown height of tens of thousands of zhang, with clouds drifting past so it appeared half-hidden and inscrutable.

As the commotion from the Imperial Garden spread, an invisible pressure leisurely rippled outward.

The force of Imperial Might! Fortunately this Imperial Might was not overwhelming; otherwise, at least eighty percent of the warriors on Dark Star would be in for a world of trouble.

Buzz…

Gentle trembling sounds came from all over Dark Star as palm-sized jade tablets began to emit a soft, pure light and drifted out as if attracted by some mysterious power — even those stored in spatial rings seemed to fly forth of their own accord.

The owners of those Imperial Jades grasped them, and an indescribable sensation spread through their bodies; each trembled and showed expressions of joy.

The Imperial Garden is about to open!

No one had told them this, yet when they gripped their Imperial Jades they simultaneously felt that marvel — since the Imperial Garden first manifested until now had passed two or three years, and at last the Garden would open.

This was a monumental opportunity; countless people were stirred and excited.

Within the Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai's figure flickered and he appeared beside Yang Yan and the others, his face solemn as he looked up.

"Yang Kai!" Yang Yan called, her crimson lips parting to speak, but Yang Kai grinned and said, "I know."

Yang Yan slightly nodded and said no more.

Qian Tong and the others wanted to ask how stable Yang Kai's current realm was, but clearly this was not the time; they too fell silent.

Time passed. Under everyone's watchful eyes, the Imperial Garden in the sky was wrapped in thick multicolored auroras that gave it a magnificent, exquisite appearance. Soon the aurora surged into the Garden as if absorbed.

Immediately, three pillars of white light shot down from beneath the Imperial Garden, descending at an extremely slow pace.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's heart jolted and his expression shifted.

When the Imperial Jade surfaced last time, a similar situation occurred — the Protective Mountain Array of Dragon Lair Mountain was shattered. Now there were light pillars again, and three of them at once; could the Lingxiao Sect be about to suffer the same fate?

Luckily Yang Kai's worry proved excessive. Though the three pillars descended straight down, they stopped while still in midair. When the beams vanished, something seemed to remain suspended there, emitting a dazzling radiance.

Everyone held their breath and looked toward that place.

Though distant, the assembled were powerful enough to see clearly: where the three pillars had vanished hung three white jade discs, eerily floating in midair.

They were not large, occupying only a few zhang across, and exquisite, mysterious patterns glimmered on their surfaces, clearly etched with intricate formations; the discs were separated by at least a hundred li.

"Space Array!" Yang Yan's beautiful eyes flickered with a trace of surprise as she cried thoughtfully, "It seems one must pass through those three Space Arrays to enter the Imperial Garden."

"So that's it!" Qian Tong and the others' faces brightened with sudden understanding.

In recent days they had been guessing how to penetrate the Imperial Garden once it opened — after all, to the naked eye there seemed no obvious entrance, which had plagued many strong experts on Dark Star.

They originally thought the entrance was connected to the Imperial Jade that had recently appeared. But now it seemed that view was gravely mistaken.

When the Imperial Garden opens, three Space Arrays appear. One only needs to pass through those Space Arrays to enter the Garden! The Imperial Jade merely serves to resist the Imperial Might.

Without an Imperial Jade, one cannot even approach the three Space Arrays!

Everything suddenly became clear.

"I'll go ahead first!" While the crowd pondered, an elderly voice sounded nearby, and two figures shot up into the sky, becoming streaks of light that rushed toward one of the Space Arrays.

They were none other than the Hall Master and the Great Elder of Piaomiao Hall!

Now that the Imperial Garden had opened and the Space Arrays appeared, they naturally did not wish to delay; first strike wins, so they set off at once.

By offering an Imperial Jade as payment they gained entry into the Lingxiao Sect's internal area, and from the square could depart for the Imperial Garden, arriving at least half a day sooner than those from elsewhere on Dark Star.

They could use that half day to explore more places and seek more treasures!

Right after they set off toward the Imperial Garden, two other groups within the Lingxiao Sect also took to the sky, though their departure points were less favorable — still within the Sect's territory but far from the square.

These two groups had paid heavy prices to purchase their departure locations from the Lingxiao Sect, and Yang Kai's Dayan Divine Sand had been obtained from one of those.

At the same time, beyond the Flowing Flame Sandland, various factions long waiting rose into the sky, becoming multicolored lights.

However, to approach the Imperial Garden and its Space Arrays they had to first circumvent the barrier formed by the Three Flames Ring, which would consume much time.

Seeing the two from Piaomiao Hall take the lead, Qian Tong glanced anxiously at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai, of course, knew what he meant and grinned: "Let's go too."

Qian Tong rejoiced and immediately, with Fei Zhi Tu, churned their Saint Yuan and, with Wei Guchang wrapped in them, flew upward.

Four from Liuli Sect followed close behind, and three from Qiantian Sect were not to be outdone; they all departed.

"Elders, while we're gone please look after things in the Sect!" Yang Kai glanced at Chang Qi and the others and softly instructed.

"We obey the Sect Master's orders!" Chang Qi and the others replied in unison.

There was nothing much to instruct — this time Yang Kai, Yang Yan and Ye Xijun would all leave for the Imperial Garden. Those left behind were not very powerful, but the Lingxiao Sect's special location meant that even if someone tried anything, they could not break through the Three Flames Ring's barrier to attack from within.

The Lingxiao Sect could be considered as safe as possible.

"Let's go!" Yang Kai glanced at Yang Yan, then vanished from the spot; when he reappeared he was a hundred zhang away.

It was unclear what means Yang Yan used, but she matched him and quickly appeared by his side. Ye Xijun, as a peak Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, was even faster than Yang Kai and easily kept pace with him and Yang Yan.

The three of them flew straight upward. Unlike the others, who were tense and full of anticipation, both Yang Kai and Yang Yan remained calm and unperturbed.

Yang Kai's composure came from having already entered the Imperial Garden once and thus being somewhat familiar with it; with that prior experience this foray should be far easier.

Yang Yan herself was a Soul Incarnation of the Emperor. The Imperial Garden was, after all, the Emperor's private courtyard; though she did not know much now, once inside her buried memories should slowly awaken, and no one could know the Garden as well as she could.

Influenced by them, Ye Xijun's excited mood gradually calmed.

"Yang Kai, how is your realm now?" While flying, Yang Yan suddenly asked with concern.

"I haven't had time to stabilize it yet, but it's fine — after a few fights it should be about right," Yang Kai grinned, not treating it as a big deal.

Generally, after advancing to a major realm, a martial artist needs time to stabilize it, usually by meditating and cultivation. But fighting others is another path, though it carries risks.

Yang Kai didn't mind; he was confident he could stabilize his realm through battle.

"Good," Yang Yan nodded lightly.

The rest of the journey passed in silence. The three poured all their strength into flying upward. From below, the Imperial Garden seemed to hover not far above the Lingxiao Sect, yet once they truly set out toward it, Yang Kai realized it was actually suspended tens of thousands of li high in the sky—no matter how far he flew, it remained directly above him.

Moreover, as they neared, the Imperial Might emanating from the Garden grew stronger — like an invisible quagmire, it affected the flow of Saint Yuan within warriors' bodies and dragged on their speed.

Yang Kai's eyes lit up; rather than being alarmed he was pleased, wearing an expression of thoughtful eagerness.

After ascending another thousand zhang or so, the Imperial Might suddenly intensified. Yang Yan and Ye Xijun had to activate the function of their Imperial Jades to generate light shields that enveloped their bodies.

Yang Kai, however, halted in midair.

"What's wrong?" Yang Yan looked at him puzzled, not understanding why he would pause at such a critical moment.

"You three go on ahead! I want to cultivate here a bit," Yang Kai said, looking up at her.

Yang Yan frowned but soon showed comprehension: "You want to refine your Shi by drawing on the Imperial Might here?"

Ye Xijun was also stunned.

"Indeed!" Yang Kai did not deny it. "This is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity, I want to try!"

When he and Fei Zhi Tu had gone to rescue Qian Tong and entered the Fallen Emperor Mountains, Ning Xiangchen once told Yang Kai that when he reached the Origin Returning Realm he should come to the Fallen Emperor Mountains to refine his Shi because Imperial Might existed there.

Refining one's Shi using Imperial Might was believed to yield a Shi far stronger than ordinary; the benefits were inexpressible, though it had never been proven, and no one truly knew the truth.

Back then Yang Kai had kept this in mind; true or not, once he reached the Origin Returning Realm he would visit the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

If the speculation were true, that would be excellent; if not, it mattered little — Imperial Might was widely acknowledged to help warriors refine their Shi.

But since the Imperial Garden manifested, Imperial Might seemed absent from the Fallen Emperor Mountains, so Yang Kai's chance to refine his Shi by Imperial Might might only be this once. If he missed it, he might never find comparable conditions again.
