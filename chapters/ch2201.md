## Chapter 2201 — Courting Death, Aren't You

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai visibly relaxed.

Xiao Yuyang said solemnly, "Let me make it clear: this Lord is not here to seize your Spiritual Pills! It's just, as the saying goes, 'an innocent man gets into trouble because of his treasures.' With your cultivation, if you carry a Supreme Mystic Pill, you will surely invite endless disaster in the future."

Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. "I understand. Thank you for your concern, Lord Xiao."

He knew that although Xiao Yuyang's words sounded pleasant, his true purpose was to take his Supreme Mystic Pill. Of course, 'take' might not be the right word—he would surely offer some compensation in return.

Still, Xiao Yuyang was not wrong. If Yang Kai really had extra Supreme Mystic Pills on him, he could forget about living in peace. He wasn't afraid of Dao Origin Realm cultivators, but what about those in the Emperor Realm?

Emperor Realm experts indeed had no need for Supreme Mystic Pills themselves, but which Emperor Realm expert didn't have juniors or disciples? Such a pill was just as tempting to them.

At that time, countless Emperor Realm experts would surely come after him, chasing and cornering him from all sides...

But now, the fact that all the Supreme Mystic Pills Yang Kai refined had been used up was confirmed, and it was verified by Xiao Yuyang and the other five Emperor Realm experts together.

He believed that from now on, no one would trouble Yang Kai or try to get a Supreme Mystic Pill from him.

In a sense, Yang Kai really ought to feel grateful to Xiao Yuyang.

By this point, Yang Kai's Spatial Ring had already been passed to Gao Xueting. The other five had finished checking it and found nothing, and Gao Xueting didn't waste any effort either, simply returning the Spatial Ring to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai put the ring back on and looked at Xiao Yuyang. "If there's nothing else, Lord Xiao, I will take my leave."

"Mm." Xiao Yuyang nodded lightly, then looked at him and said, "This Lord has a word of advice. I wonder if you are willing to hear it?"

"It is an honor to receive your guidance, Lord Xiao!" Yang Kai immediately straightened up.

Seeing his tact, Xiao Yuyang's expression softened considerably. He said in a deep voice, "Greed leads to biting off more than you can chew!"

Yang Kai raised his brows, looking thoughtful, and cupped his fists. "Thank you for the advice, Lord. I will keep it in mind."

"That's best. You may go." Xiao Yuyang waved his hand.

Only then did Yang Kai leave, heading to where the disciples of Qingyang Shrine were gathered, finding a place to sit down.

At this moment, in nameless valley, many cultivators were gathered in groups, resting by sect and family units.

But looking at the numbers, there were over a third fewer people than thirty-three days ago. Those who didn't appear here clearly met with misfortune in Four Seasons Land.

In this world, every secret realm and every place of training comes with risks as well as opportunities. The path of a cultivator is always a dance between life and death...

This is the fate every cultivator must face, a destiny none can avoid!

The cultivation path is like panning for gold in a raging river—each wave washes away the weak, leaving only the strongest behind. Only those who survive the endless trials and tribulations can truly stand at the peak.

While Yang Kai was resting, Bian Yuqing and Kou Wu came to bid him farewell.

This time, only the two of them from Biyu Sect came to Four Seasons Land for training. Their luck was decent; though they didn't gain much, at least they returned safely.

Now that Four Seasons Land was about to close, the two naturally had to return to Biyu Sect.

Yang Kai chatted with them for a while, then watched them leave.

He hadn't bothered telling Bian Yuqing not to mention him to Wu Mengchuan, because he knew she would report everything to Wu Mengchuan after returning. News about him would surely reach their ears.

Yang Kai was quite wary of that fellow.

He could only resolve to avoid meeting that old fox until he became strong enough, lest he fall into his trap.

About an hour later, as a buzzing sound filled the air, the entrance portal in the nameless valley vanished. Four Seasons Land was now completely closed, and who knew when it would open again.

With this, the journey to Four Seasons Land was truly over. One after another, cultivators from various sects and families began to leave. Over there, after saying a word to Xiao Yuyang, Gao Xueting summoned the flying ship and took the disciples of Qingyang Shrine back home.

Qingyang Shrine didn't suffer much this time. Aside from Yang Kai, an outsider, they had brought nineteen disciples and only lost four on the way back.

Such losses were within Gao Xueting's acceptable range and much smaller than those of other sects.

Still, people had died. On the way back, the disciples were not in high spirits, silently meditating to consolidate their gains from Four Seasons Land.

At one point, Yang Kai suddenly heard Gao Xueting calling him. He quickly opened his eyes and looked over, seeing the Qingyang Shrine Elder standing on the deck of the flying ship, her long hair fluttering, her robes billowing, as if gazing into the distance. Her graceful figure added beauty to the world.

Yang Kai dared not be negligent and hurried over to her.

When he reached a spot not far behind Gao Xueting, Yang Kai cupped his fists and said respectfully, "Elder Gao, do you have any instructions?"

Gao Xueting didn't answer directly, only said softly, "Do you understand what Lord Xiao told you earlier?"

Yang Kai pondered for a moment. "Lord Xiao meant for me to choose between the Martial Dao and the Dao of Alchemy."

"That's right!" Gao Xueting nodded slightly. Her beautiful face turned toward him, eyes blazing as she said, "Your talent in both the Martial Dao and the Dao of Alchemy is extraordinary. Given time, you will surely achieve greatness in one of these domains, perhaps even reach heights I cannot. But... a person's energy is limited. If you choose the Martial Dao, you must give up the Dao of Alchemy, and vice versa. You cannot devote yourself to both. Lord Xiao's advice was well-intentioned."

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

"As long as you understand... I have nothing else."

"Then I will take my leave." Yang Kai bowed slightly.

He was surprised Gao Xueting called him over just to say this.

Still, it left him with some feelings. He wasn't a disciple of Qingyang Shrine, but Gao Xueting seemed to care about him. Otherwise, she wouldn't have bothered to say all this.

Yang Kai had just turned to leave when he suddenly heard a voice behind him: "That Supreme Mystic Pill... is it really gone?"

Yang Kai quickly turned his head, but saw only Gao Xueting's back, motionless, as if she hadn't spoken at all.

He stood there frowning for a while, but didn't dare speak again. He could only return to his seat and resume meditating.

This woman... did she see through something? A woman's intuition really is terrifying, Yang Kai thought to himself.

Several days passed quietly.

On this day, over the Qingyang Mountain Range, a beautiful flying ship sped by. The Dao Origin Realm cultivators on board had recovered from their grief and now stood up, gazing at the familiar scenery below.

"Wahahaha! I, Xia Sheng, am back!" Xia Sheng stood with his hands on his hips, laughing loudly as if afraid no one would notice. His voice rolled over the mountains as the ship flew on.

The Qingyang Shrine disciples below all looked up in surprise.

"Can you act a little more mature?" Xiao Baiyi looked at him coldly, full of disdain.

"Xiao Bai, we're home, you should be happy! Come, shout with Senior Brother..." Xia Sheng said, walking over to Xiao Baiyi and putting his arm around his shoulders.

"Who wants to shout with you..." Xiao Baiyi's forehead throbbed with veins.

"So embarrassing!" Murong Xiaoxiao's face turned red.

"Hmph!" Xiao Baiyi snorted coldly, glancing at Xia Sheng. "Look at the Senior Brothers from other sects, look at Wuchang and Luo Yuan, all cold and reliable, making their Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters feel safe. But you, you never act proper. How can you be Senior Brother like this?"

"So you want a cold Senior Brother?" Suddenly, Xia Sheng's expression turned serious, his eyes flashing coldly. The playful look vanished, replaced by an air of arrogance and dominance.

In that instant, Xia Sheng's aura changed dramatically.

"If other Senior Brothers can do it, so can I!" he said solemnly.

Murong Xiaoxiao was stunned, her mouth forming an 'O', her small hand covering it, her beautiful eyes trembling.

"Do you feel safe and secure now... Do you want to throw yourself into Senior Brother's broad chest and strong arms?" Xia Sheng asked in a deep, powerful voice, staring at her.

Murong Xiaoxiao bit her red lips, timidly saying, "Senior Brother, your killing intent... is leaking out..."

"Enough!" Gao Xueting glanced at Xia Sheng. "When the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam is crooked! Stop imitating our Hall Master, or you'll never find a woman."

"Really?" Xia Sheng looked as if struck by lightning, breaking into a cold sweat as he muttered, "That's true... Other Sect Masters and Hall Masters have wives and concubines, enjoying all kinds of blessings, but our Hall Master is still a bachelor..."

His face turned pale, as if he had seen something terrifying. Looking at Gao Xueting, he said, "Elder Gao, isn't it pitiful for the Hall Master? Haven't you ever thought... ah, again?"

Before he could finish, Gao Xueting flicked her sleeve and tossed him off the flying ship. His long, miserable scream faded into the distance.

"Courting death, aren't you!" Xiao Baiyi showed not a shred of sympathy, only snorting coldly.

Murong Xiaoxiao turned to look back, wanting to plead for Xia Sheng, but when she met Gao Xueting's gaze, she swallowed her words in fright.
