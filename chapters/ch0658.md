## Chapter 658 — Desperate Battle

A volcano, dormant for many years, suddenly erupted; as molten rock spewed from its mouth, dazzling bolts of lightning flashed across the sky, striking down like spirit-snakes in dense, countless streams.

Those who had been dodging the lava had not yet reacted before the lightning struck them, instantly bursting into clouds of blood mist, leaving not even scraps of bone behind — their deaths were unbearably tragic.

More of the Ancient Demon Clan went pale, terror flooding their eyes; hastily they unleashed their power and instinctively fled in all directions.

Crack, crack — lava and lightning combined in concert, and the entire volcanic region became a deathly wasteland in an instant.

Heavenly Might rolled forth in overwhelming waves!

Li Rong, Hua Mo, and Chu Jian, the three great commanders, all wore the gravest of expressions; daring not to linger, they swept backward, for none of them knew what change had occurred here, and such Heavenly Might was not something even the three of them would lightly confront.

Far above the clouds, heavenly thunder roared; beneath the volcano, rivers of molten rock shot forth.

This display of Heavenly Might shook every Ancient Demon master present, causing their hearts to tremble.

In this Small Xuan Realm they had never before encountered danger of such magnitude, but today they were witnessing it.

In a very short time, Chu Jian’s and Li Rong–Hua Mo’s forces had both retreated dozens of li from the volcanic mouth and reached relatively safe positions; separated by dozens of li, they gazed at the calamity befalling the crater in silence.

Li Rong’s face was ashen; if she had still harbored the slightest hope for Yang Kai and Han Fei’s survival a moment ago, that hope had now been ruthlessly extinguished by reality.

Under such Heavenly Might, Li Rong felt that Yang Kai and Han Fei could not possibly have survived.

It was at that moment that, from the chaotic volcanic mouth, two figures suddenly burst forth.

The swirling lava and lightning masked them so thoroughly that no one noticed those two figures; every mind present had already been seized by that vast Heavenly Might.

The instant they emerged from the crater, Yang Kai and Han Fei’s faces changed drastically.

They had not expected that, after expending every effort to escape the volcano, they would be greeted by a scene like the end of the world; the air reeked of death and involuntary panic rose within them.

“Run!” Han Fei cried sharply; at this point she no longer needed Yang Kai to shelter her. Instead she circulated True Yuan, wrapped Yang Kai within it, and led him, flying off in a single direction.

Yang Kai did not hesitate; he brought forth the Bone Shield, poured True Yuan into it, and opened the shield’s beast-mouth in a hideous snarl, holding it aloft as a barrier to take the lethal blows for them.

Boom, boom, boom…

Lightning struck again and again, all absorbed by the Bone Shield, but after receiving three or five bolts Yang Kai noticed the defensive Secret Treasure — one refined to Mystery-Grade Upper-Level — beginning to show signs of strain.

Fortunately Han Fei’s movements were exceptionally nimble; guiding Yang Kai, she wove them constantly through the interlaced lava and lightning, each time skirting the most dangerous spots.

After a short while, the two at last broke free of the most perilous area.

“People ahead!” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and barked, then his expression shifted: “It’s Chu Jian!”

“Damn it!” Han Fei’s heart chilled; she had not expected Chu Jian to be waiting outside for so long.

The two of them had lingered inside the volcano for at least half a month, and Chu Jian’s patience came as a surprise to her.

“Get ready to run,” Yang Kai murmured darkly into Han Fei’s ear.

Han Fei gave a slight nod.

The moment they were spotted by Chu Jian’s side, the other party recognized them as well; when Chu Jian caught sight of Yang Kai and Han Fei he could not help but show delight and sneered, “They’re still alive — hahahaha, heaven truly aids me!”

Saying that, he cast his gaze toward the opposite side of the volcano, unable to make out Li Rong and Hua Mo’s situation.

Chu Jian’s heart steadied; since he could not see the other side and they could not see him, he had the chance to seize Yang Kai and Han Fei before Li Rong reacted.

If he captured the two, Chu Jian would gain bargaining chips against Li Rong!

Li Rong’s apparent concern that this human had drawn attention even beyond Commander Han Fei’s care puzzled Chu Jian, and he wondered whether there was some deeper meaning to it.

Not far off, the human and Han Fei, having escaped the most dangerous region, had altered course and were skimming sideways, clearly attempting to slip out of sight.

Chu Jian sneered and, without hesitation, unleashed Demon God Transformation.

A ferocious visage was swiftly overlaid with black Demon Marks, rendering him more horrific still; his peak second-stage Transcendent cultivation received a tremendous boost, and his qi-and-blood potency and combat prowess surged.

In a blink he intercepted Yang Kai and Han Fei, blocking their way, and said coldly, “You’re lucky to be alive, but not this time! Han Fei, hand him over.”

Saying so, a huge hand shot out to seize Han Fei.

Han Fei snorted, shoved Yang Kai with force so as to fling him far away, and promptly invoked Demon God Transformation herself to repel Chu Jian’s assault.

Although their strength differed by a small degree, Han Fei gave her all to buy some time.

The last time she had been grievously wounded by Chu Jian, it was only because he had suddenly revealed hidden strength and caught her unprepared.

Yang Kai understood Han Fei’s intention; riding the force with which she had thrown him, he shot far out, but the next moment he found himself surrounded by a dozen Ancient Demon Clan warriors.

They were all Chu Jian’s subordinates, the weakest among them being at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, and two or three were even Transcendent Realm experts.

Yang Kai hovered in midair, frowning at the encircling enemies, his heart heavy as he sensed the enormous pressure emanating from them.

“Human, come with us. Lord Chu Jian wants your assistance!” a burly man of the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm said coldly to Yang Kai.

“What if I say no?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes to slits, a glint flashing within.

“Then you’ll taste pain.” The burly man sneered, brazenly gliding toward Yang Kai and stretching out a hand to seize him.

His great hand wavered like a mirage as it entered Yang Kai’s sight; Yang Kai could not discern the strike’s path, only a phantom streaked before his eyes, and a sudden sense of peril arose.

Yang Kai held the Bone Shield horizontally before him; the lightning stored within it suddenly erupted at the critical moment.

Whish...

A thunderous electric radiance blasted from the beast-mouth of the Bone Shield, instantly shattering the phantom.

The Third Stage Transcendent burly man fell back several steps, then flung his palm wide as an evil-laden energy beam shot from his fingertip.

With a tremendous roar the two energies collided and nullified one another.

Yang Kai, decisive and unhesitating, concentrated all his Divine Sense power and guided the Spirit-Soul Short Sword in his Sea of Consciousness, transforming it into a streak of crimson light that darted toward the burly man.

“Such a hateful aura!” The burly man, sensing the nature of Yang Kai’s Divine Sense energy, twisted in disgust; murder rose in his eyes as he unleashed his own Divine Sense power and clashed without retreat.

The invisible confrontation lasted only an instant; Yang Kai went pale, spat a mouthful of blood mist, and staggered.

Though his Divine Sense power could match an ordinary Transcendent, it still lagged behind that of a Third Stage Transcendent; if not for the special nature of his Divine Sense, that single collision would have been enough to shatter his soul.

Yet the burly man had also suffered a minor loss.

He had underestimated the ferocity of Divine Sense Fire; after the clash he clutched his head and howled in pain, his face distorted with agony.

When cultivated to its utmost, Divine Sense Fire can consume all things; although Yang Kai had only started specializing in Divine Sense Fire in the past year, having devoured over a dozen others’ Divine Sense Fire made his offense not to be dismissed.

“Seize him! I’ll crush every bone in his body!” the burly man howled as he hurled commands to his kin.

Yang Kai’s hands moved like a dancing butterfly, and dozens of droplets of Yang Liquid suddenly formed around him, coalescing into many sharp spears aimed at the oncoming Ancient Demon warriors.

Swish, swish, swish…

The Yang Liquid spears shot forth with lightning speed.

The Ancient Demon fighters deployed their defenses, but under this attack that suppressed demon qi some were inevitably struck.

Their vaunted sturdy bodies were like paper before the keen Yang Liquid spears, pierced clean through.

A cacophony of tearing sounds rang out as demon qi and yang qi violently collided, purifying and dissolving one another; two or three of the Ancient Demon Clan warriors were instantly grievously injured.

Wounds from ordinary attacks they could disregard, for with their robust constitutions they could recover in a few days.

But this was an attack of Yang Liquid, their nemesis; the holes in their flesh could never be mended unless they transformed away the invaded Yang-origin energy.

Blood gushed forth like streams, spectacular as fountains.

The remaining Ancient Demon fighters grew ever more savage, paying no heed to their comrades’ fate as they surged toward Yang Kai, each heavy fist descending like a mountain.

Yang Kai barely had time to condense two more layers of Yang Liquid shielding before being dazed by the onslaught.

The two layers of Yang Liquid shields collapsed in an instant; under the combined assault of two or three Transcendent Realm masters and seven or eight peak Divine Roaming fighters, he could not hold even a moment.

Blood spouted from his mouth as Yang Kai’s body was flung far like a kite, plummeting from the sky.

“Keep him alive!” the burly man whose Divine Sense had been slightly wounded barked; his subordinates obeyed and pursued after Yang Kai.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the volcano, Li Rong and Hua Mo at last sensed that something was amiss here.

“Lady Li, there seems to be a battle over there!” Hua Mo said, his expression strange as he listened intently and then confirmed what he heard.

“That aura…” Li Rong probed with difficulty; the central eruption and the lightning rendered her unable to see the opposite situation clearly, and her Divine Sense scan was exceedingly vague, yet she still keenly felt a trace of a familiar energy fluctuation and her face brightened: “It’s Han Fei!”

“Commander Han Fei isn’t dead?” Hua Mo also became elated.

“If she’s all right, that outsider must be fine too!” Li Rong said, her lithe form turning into a streak of light as she hastened toward them.
