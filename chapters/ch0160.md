## Chapter 160 — Opening the Cave

Yang Kai now wished to descend a bit further, to absorb more Yang Qi for his cultivation.

Moreover, beside the Dragon Confinement Ravine, the howling gale made the cultivation environment unbearable.

If he could carve out a niche in the cliff wall, it would spare him from the torment of wind and sun.

The ropes he had purchased were pieced together, enough to support Yang Kai as he slid down a hundred zhang.

When he reached the limit of his descent, Yang Kai looked down and saw that the Dragon Confinement Ravine was still bottomless, making it impossible to discern what lay beneath.

A chill ran through his heart as he thought about what would happen if the rope snapped at this moment…

However, the Yang Qi here was indeed much denser than above.

Yang Kai was quite satisfied. After observing for a moment, he carefully tapped on the nearby rock wall, pinpointing a relatively good location.

There was a sturdy ancient pine tree leaning against the cliff, its dense needles resembling a giant umbrella. If he could carve out a space beneath this ancient pine, the tree would provide shelter from the wind and rain, presenting a natural advantage.

Resolute in his decision, Yang Kai forced out a drop of Yang Liquid from his Dantian, condensing it at his fingertip and transforming it into a blade, which he then cut into the rock wall before him.

There was no significant obstruction; the sharpness of the Yang Liquid blade lived up to Yang Kai's expectations, directly slicing off a chunk of rock.

When Yang Kai was at the third layer of the Open Origin Realm, the blade made from Yang Liquid could destroy a Common-Grade Middle-Level defensive treasure. Now that his strength had increased significantly, cutting through the rock was naturally effortless.

The Yang Liquid in his Dantian was limited; most of what he had obtained in the Inheritance Celestial Cave had been used during his dual cultivation with Su Yan, leaving only four or five drops.

After expending three full drops of Yang Liquid, Yang Kai finally carved out an entrance large enough for one person on the rock wall. He crawled into the cave and continued to cut, tossing the chunks of rock down into the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

After a long while, the sound of stones hitting the ground echoed from below. From the intervals of these sounds, Yang Kai could roughly estimate the depth of the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Calculating in his heart, he couldn't help but gasp; this Dragon Confinement Ravine was likely over ten thousand zhang deep.

After half a day's effort, the cave had expanded significantly, but the Yang Liquid was now exhausted.

Without Yang Liquid, Yang Kai could not continue his excavation relying solely on his own strength.

He pulled out a bottle from his pocket, a gift from Xia Ningshang the day before. Remembering that little junior sister, Yang Kai felt a pang of guilt.

Fortunately, he hadn't done much that night in the Jiuyin Valley; otherwise, he truly wouldn't know how to face her now.

After consuming a few pills, he condensed some Yang Liquid and continued to carve out his cave.

While doing this, Yang Kai was filled with vigor and excitement, not feeling tired at all. Watching the cave gradually expand, he felt like a strong cultivator establishing his secret abode.

For several days, Yang Kai toiled within the cave. When the Yang Liquid ran out, he supplemented it with the pills refined by Xia Ningshang. He quenched his thirst with the dew collected from the ancient pine in the morning. He wasn't particularly hungry; at his current strength in the Qi Movement Realm, he could go a month without food, though he would eventually need to replenish.

After seven days, the cave was completed to a satisfactory degree.

Standing inside the cave and gazing at his hard-earned creation, a sense of satisfaction welled up within him, and he couldn't help but chuckle foolishly.

Now, the cave was already twice the size of his small wooden house, with the area closest to the entrance designated for cultivation and meditation. Sitting at the cave's mouth, he could hardly feel the howling gale from the Dragon Confinement Ravine below; he could only hear a faint whimpering sound, which was a far cry from the environment at the top.

Facing the cave entrance, there was a small stone chamber on the left, not very large. This was where Yang Kai planned to store his miscellaneous items, including the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs he had purchased from the Black Wind Trading Market.

On the right side was a slightly larger stone chamber, serving as a resting place. Inside, Yang Kai had carved out a stone bed, its surface smooth and even. He had polished it meticulously for a long time, ensuring it would be comfortable to sleep on.

For reasons unknown, this stone bed was quite large, enough to accommodate two or three people tossing and turning.

Cough, cough… Better safe than sorry! Yang Kai thought.

In the middle, there was another empty stone chamber, currently unsure of what to store there.

This was Yang Kai's cave now; though simple, it felt quite cozy inside, even more so than that small wooden house.

Generally, few people came to the Dragon Confinement Ravine. In the future, if he had items that were inconvenient to carry, he could store them here without worrying about being discovered by others.

After some thought, Yang Kai climbed back up the rope, cutting out footholds along the way. This way, he wouldn't need to rely on the rope to enter and exit in the future, and he could avoid the worry of someone discovering his cave by following the rope.

Untying the rope from the large stone, Yang Kai returned to his cave.

After spending so many days, he had finally crafted a place for his cultivation. This cultivation environment was likely superior to that of all the disciples in the Lingxiao Pavilion.

Not rushing to cultivate, Yang Kai simply sat cross-legged at the cave entrance, enjoying the tranquility and warmth.

Suddenly, he remembered something and reached into his pocket to take it out.

The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, a spiritual treasure of heaven and earth, had remained in his possession since he acquired it, neither fleeing nor struggling.

At this moment, when he took it out, the expression on the ginseng's human-like face seemed to smile at Yang Kai.

The Earth Demon had mentioned that such things only grow in extraordinary places where Yin and Yang coexisted. Yang Kai had previously been puzzled about why there was Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, but after gaining the inheritance, everything became clear.

That place was originally the site of the Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation Technique's inheritance, so it was only natural for this spiritual treasure to grow there.

Extending his hand, he pointed out a drop of Yang Liquid and sent it into the body of the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng. To his surprise, it absorbed the Yang Liquid in an instant, its expression becoming even more joyful.

With a flow of radiant light, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng actually flew out of Yang Kai's hand, curiously wandering around the simple cave. Before long, it found a spot, twisted its body, and rooted itself down, looking utterly content.

As the radiant light swirled, Yang Kai could clearly feel the Yang Qi from below the Dragon Confinement Ravine being continuously absorbed by it, even enriching the Yang Qi around him.

It actually had this effect? Yang Kai was taken aback.

With a thought, he released the restrictions on the Soul-Breaking Spike, and the Earth Demon's respectful voice immediately came through: "The old servant greets the young master!"

"Take a look at this Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng. What do you have to say?" Yang Kai asked.

The Earth Demon replied, "This thing is born from absorbing Yin and Yang Qi. The Yang Qi here is dense, making it a suitable environment for its growth. However…"

"Speak plainly, don’t beat around the bush!" Yang Kai coldly snorted.

The Earth Demon trembled at his voice. Although he had not known Yang Kai for long, he was genuinely afraid of him. Having had his soul sealed within the Soul-Breaking Spike multiple times and facing punishment from him, the Earth Demon had witnessed Yang Kai's decisiveness and ruthlessness. He quickly said, "After all, it needs to absorb both Yin and Yang Qi. Here, there is only Yang Qi. In the short term, there is no need to worry too much, but over time, this thing will not only fail to grow but may even wither. For it, solitary Yang does not thrive, and solitary Yin does not grow; this is the nature of the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng!"

"It lacks Yin Qi, right?" Yang Kai asked.

"Exactly, young master!" 

This was easy to handle; he could have Su Yan come and infuse it with True Essence another day, which should resolve the issue.

After a moment of hesitation, Yang Kai asked with a strange expression, "You previously said that if it encounters a pair of lovers whose hearts resonate, it will autonomously transform into two energies, dispersing within the bodies of those lovers. Is that true?"

"Yes!" the Earth Demon replied, then suddenly looked astonished: "Eh? Young master, you… cough, cough… did it?"

Before being sealed, Yang Kai had still been a virgin, but upon seeing him again, the Earth Demon realized he had lost the innate pure Yang energy he had possessed since birth, which was clearly a result of having been intimate with a woman.

"Who allowed you to pry into my affairs?" Yang Kai said coldly.

"Forgive me, young master! The old servant was merely curious; I will never dare again." 

"You'd better not let there be a next time!" Yang Kai reminded lightly.

Furrowing his brow, Yang Kai pondered deeply.

Though he did not know the Earth Demon's origins, he was well-versed in knowledge and knew much about the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, so he was likely not lying.

In that grand hall, when he and Su Yan were in love, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng had been right beside them.

Yet it had not transformed into energy to merge into his and Su Yan's bodies, allowing them to become one in heart and soul. This could only mean one thing: the feelings between him and Su Yan had not yet reached the level of true resonance.

Yang Kai understood this as well. Although they had already shared a marital bond, it had been completed under the influence of the inheritance, not of their own volition. To put it bluntly, without the existence of the Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation Technique, Su Yan would likely resent him for taking her virginity. Even if she didn't hold a grudge, she wouldn't have any fondness for him, let alone resonate with him.

Su Yan had yet to fully open her heart, and so had Yang Kai!

Even if they felt close now and were willing to give everything for each other, including their lives, all of this was influenced by the special effects of the Dual Cultivation Technique.

Love between a man and a woman is not something that can be cultivated overnight or through a single technique.

The day would come when, even without the Dual Cultivation Technique, they could regard each other as the most important person in their lives, and only then would they truly resonate in heart and soul.

A somewhat unorthodox voice from the Earth Demon broke the silence: "Young master need not be discouraged. The old servant believes that women are generally easy to coax. Since you have already gained their bodies, it is only a matter of time before you capture their hearts. I can guarantee this with my life!"

"Weren't you supposed to be dead already?" Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Seeing that he was not angry, the Earth Demon grew bolder and laughed: "Yes, yes, young master is right. Then the old servant guarantees it with my soul. Women always have a special feeling for their first man. As long as you use a little strategy, they will be devoted to you, and true resonance will be just around the corner. At that time, this Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng will be able to exert its tremendous effect."
