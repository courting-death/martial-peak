## Chapter 339 — Soul Evil Spirit

This is the sacrifice!

The unpassed secret of Xiaoyao Sect, a martial skill that can only be used in conjunction with a Meinu to extinguish humanity!

This move can no longer be described as evil.

In just ten breaths, several male disciples of Xiaoyao Sect transformed in appearance, filled with vigor and ambition.

Yet the Meinus they embraced had permanently lost their vitality. However, in their dimmed eyes, there seemed to linger a never-ending sentiment, and on their withered lips, a trace of satisfaction remained.

Beauty turned to bones in an instant!

Zhao Rong and the sisters from the Hu family unleashed their True Essence uncontrollably, their three pairs of beautiful eyes filled with hatred as they glared at the male disciples of Xiaoyao Sect, their bodies trembling.

They were all women, and the death of the Meinus naturally resonated with them.

With the sacrifice complete, Yu Qing laughed heartily as he released the withered corpse from his embrace. The corpse rolled on the ground, fell from the high platform, and vanished into the waters of the Evil Fiend Spring.

The disciples of Xiaoyao Sect, now with increased strength, seemed to exude an aura of superiority, their moves becoming exponentially more forceful than before. However, when they looked at the old man, there was still a hint of concealed anger and enmity in Yu Qing's eyes.

He didn’t wish to sacrifice the Meinus at this moment because it was not yet the most dangerous time.

But due to the old man's oppressive authority, he had no choice but to comply, feeling somewhat displeased inside.

The old man, seemingly oblivious, chuckled, “Not bad, I said you were a decisive person, destined for greatness! You and your Junior Brothers must hold this position for a little while; I'll be right back!”

“Understood!” Yu Qing nodded vigorously, not questioning what the old man intended to do.

With a sharp whistle, the old man leaped into the air, soaring off the high platform. Immediately after he took flight, a purple evil spirit closely followed, just like a shadow.

“What is he trying to do?” Shen Yi's expression darkened. He noticed that the old man's lips curled into a sinister smile, as he was luring the evil spirit toward them.

As he attacked the evil spirit while flying closer to the high platform, Shen Yi could only shake his head in disbelief, “This old guy has gone mad, right? What does he expect to accomplish by luring an evil spirit over here? Does he think it will kill us all?”

“Ha ha!” A male disciple of Baoqi Sect laughed, “That old man must be muddled by greed. Does he not know that Brother Yang's defensive barrier specifically counters evil spirits?”

Their conversation had no regard for the old man. Yet even within earshot, he showed no anger, only a cold smile as he continued to draw the evil spirit closer.

Leng Shan's beautiful eyes glimmered with frost, sensing something was amiss. She cautioned, “Be careful everyone. He is definitely plotting something.”

Tao Yang also nodded, silently remaining vigilant.

Before long, the old man arrived beside the high platform with the evil spirit, and everyone grew increasingly wary, ready to act at a moment's notice.

“I present you with a great gift!” The old man exclaimed as he saw it was nearly time. With a wave of his hand, he sent the evil spirit flying further, then vanished into thin air mid-flight, only to reappear back at Xiaoyao Sect.

“Senior, you had us sacrifice the Meinus just to delay for this moment?” Yu Qing's expression darkened, his tone carrying an accusatory note.

“Correct!” The old man nodded expressionlessly.

“This delay… was just to send over an evil spirit?” Yu Qing struggled to contain his anger.

He had been perplexed as to why the old man had been so eager for them to sacrifice the Meinus, but now it seemed that all this was nothing compared to the value of the four Meinus.

“Do you have objections?” The old man shot a cold glance back at Yu Qing, impatience and severity evident in his eyes.

“I dare not!” Yu Qing's heart chilled, hastily suppressing his anger. Even though their group’s strength had greatly increased post-sacrifice, they were still powerless in the face of someone in the Divine Roaming Realm!

“Remember this well, if they don’t plead for my help later, I'll twist off my head and let you use it as a chamber pot!” The old man said with a confident smile.

Yu Qing was shocked, not understanding why the old man had such confidence.

At that moment, the evil spirit had already launched an attack on the high platform where Yang Kai and the others stood.

It continually crashed against the platform, each attempt met with resistance from the defensive barrier. The scorching True Yang Primordial Qi eroded its sinister energy, yet it was unlike the other evil spirits; it showed no signs of retreating.

After several attempts, it no longer attacked recklessly. Its features became clearer as its mouth opened wide, suddenly letting out a piercing scream.

The sharp sound pierced through the ears, and as the scream erupted, a circle of purple light suddenly burst forth, engulfing everyone on the high platform.

All were expressing a look of indifference as they observed the foolishness of the evil spirit, completely unprepared for this sudden move. By the time they sensed something was amiss, it was already too late.

The wave of sound passed through their bodies, causing them all to groan in unison. A few individuals with slightly lower strength even collapsed to the ground.

The others felt dizzy and nauseous, a sensation akin to ants gnawing at their brains, the pain nearly unbearable.

Even the Hu sisters could not withstand it; their faces paled, brows furrowing deeply.

Only Yang Kai remained unaffected. Compared to the others, he had cultivated his Divine Sense, allowing him to resist a certain amount of soul damage. Moreover, with the protection of the Soul Palace, he easily withstood the attack of the evil spirit.

“Divine soul technique!” Shen Yi screamed, “It's a Soul Evil Spirit!”

Upon hearing this, everyone's expression turned pale as they looked upon the Soul Evil Spirit with immense trepidation.

The Soul Evil Spirit is a particularly unique entity among evil spirits.

It appeared no different from other evil spirits, but because it was proficient in divine soul techniques, martial artists below the Divine Roaming Realm had only two paths to take when encountering it.

Either flee or face death!

In this situation, there was no chance to escape, and fighting it would lead to certain doom.

Within the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, Soul Evil Spirits are quite rare, as evident from the current scenario. Hundreds of evil spirits had congregated, and yet only one Soul Evil Spirit had appeared, illustrating its rarity.

No one had expected to encounter a Soul Evil Spirit, just as no one had anticipated the eruption of the Evil Spirit Spring Eye.

At that moment, everyone felt as if their hearts had sunk to the abyss.

The old man had intentionally lured the Soul Evil Spirit over, clearly harboring malicious intent, a retaliation for Yang Kai’s earlier refusal to help.

Turning to look at the old man, a glint of cold light flashed in Yang Kai's eyes!

He was not afraid of the Soul Evil Spirit, but everyone else on that high platform was terrified! The recent large-scale soul technique attack had already affected them; if that kind of technique came again, everyone left besides Yang Kai would have their soul destroyed. They would either die tragically on the spot or become imbeciles!

“Hurry, hurry, hurry!” As the Soul Evil Spirit opened its black maw once more, Shen Yi urgently called out, “Divine soul treasure! Who has one?”

Everyone's gaze fixated on Tao Yang.

Though the Ghost King Valley had prepared adequately for the expedition to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, divine soul treasures were as rare as divine soul techniques, and those that could defend against divine soul techniques had to be of high grade.

The group from Ghost King Valley had no right to possess such artifacts.

Tao Yang was an elite disciple of Baoqi Sect. If he did not possess a divine soul treasure, they would be doomed.

While Yang Kai had no fear of the Soul Evil Spirit, he could only ensure his own safety. With so many gathered on the high platform, he had no countermeasure against a massive divine soul attack.

Fortunately, Tao Yang was indeed well-prepared, hurriedly taking out a ring, infusing it with True Essence and snapping his fingers.

A buzzing sound echoed out. At that moment, the Soul Evil Spirit unleashed its own divine soul technique.

Like before, the purple light burst forth, enveloping everyone.

But the ring in Tao Yang's hand also released a layer of visible ripples that surged upward to meet it.

Everyone held their breath, tense and staring.

When that layer of ripples collided with the purple light, the ripples instantly vanished, and the purple light dulled in color. Yet it did not dissipate, still reaching everyone.

The divine soul treasure that Tao Yang brought out was insufficient to defend against the attack of the Soul Evil Spirit!

Everyone's expressions were grim, and a sense of helplessness engulfed them.

However, being momentarily blocked by the treasure, the sensations entering their minds felt slightly easier to endure than before.

But this was not a long-term solution; damage to the divine soul was no trifling matter. If the accumulation of damage continued, it would become a major issue.

“Apologies, I only have this one divine soul treasure!” Tao Yang's complexion was slightly pale, his focus unwavering on the movements of the Soul Evil Spirit.

“Brother Tao, don’t say that; were it not for you, we would probably not withstand this attack at all!” Shen Yi earnestly looked at Tao Yang.

“Indeed, indeed,” Cheng Ying repeatedly nodded. “But we need to think about what to do next!”

With Tao Yang's divine soul treasure, everyone could endure for about half an hour.

Yang Kai remained silent, coldly staring at the old man on the high platform.

Seeing the dire situation here, the old man audaciously laughed heartily, his voice filled with arrogance and overjoyed delight.

As his laughter echoed, everyone could not contain their righteous anger. Had it not been for this old man’s schemes, they would have been safe hiding within the defensive barrier Yang Kai had created, but now they faced the Soul Evil Spirit with growing powerlessness.

“This old bastard!” Zhao Rong's temper flared as she unrestrainedly cursed.

“Little friend!” The old man sneered, managing his attentiveness with the evil spirit from earlier while calling out to Yang Kai, “Look at your side's crisis; we are in the same situation. Why not cooperate with me?”

“How do we cooperate?” Yang Kai asked indifferently.

“Very simple, you help us create a defensive barrier like yours over here, and I will help you deal with that Soul Evil Spirit. You cannot handle it, only because you haven't reached the Divine Roaming Realm; but I do, and I'm in the fifth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. While dealing with that Soul Evil Spirit may be a bit troublesome, it can be killed! What do you think? Such cooperation benefits us both!”
