## Chapter 1848 — Tongtian Auction House

“Send them to auction?” Yang Kai's eyes brightened. “Not a bad idea — President Hua really does have a talent for commerce!”

“You flatter me, sir!” President Hua's face flushed.

“Not at all, merely admiration. To come up with so fine an idea in so short a time is beyond most.”

“Then you agree?” Hua Youmeng looked at Yang Kai in delight.

“A stroll will do me good, and I want to see the prosperity of Purple Star City, so I’ll trouble President Hua to act as my guide.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Hua Youmeng rose at once, exclaiming happily, “Then please wait a moment, sir; I’ll be right back. After all, the matter of selling the land deeds requires me to inform Uncle Xia and the others.”

“Go on, I’ll wait outside.” Yang Kai nodded.

A short while later, Hua Youmeng stepped out of the Commerce Guild.

Opinions within the Commerce Guild differed over selling those more than thirty land deeds; some, like Hua Youmeng at first, wished to keep them all and expand the Guild — opportunities like this were rare and none wanted to miss out — while others proposed a compromise: sell half and keep half, so they would both have sufficient storefronts and enough Saint Crystal.

In the end, everyone agreed with Hua Youmeng's decision to sell all the deeds.

They did not know why Yang Kai had suggested it, but it was unwise to oppose the words of a Void King Realm expert, so they complied; yet by doing so the Commerce Guild would lose the chance to claim prime lots in Purple Star City, a prospect that made many sigh with regret.

Hua Youmeng glanced about and saw Yang Kai squatting by a nearby stall, haggling with the vendor.

A Void King Realm expert bargaining like this? Hua Youmeng felt something amiss and stepped toward them; soon Yang Kai's and the seller's voices reached her ears.

“Brother, this purple-copper luo crystal is top-grade forging material — I labored like nine oxen and two tigers to excavate it. With it one could surely forge an Upper-Level Secret Treasure of Saint King-Grade. You offer ten thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals — isn't that pushing it?” the vendor snapped.

“Ten thousand. That's not low.” Yang Kai feigned indifference and chuckled.

“Fine, fine, I’m scared of you. Eighty thousand Saint Crystals, take it as a gift.”

“Ten thousand!”

“Seventy thousand. That really is my bottom line — I absolutely can't go lower!”

“Ten thousand!”

“Don't joke with me, will you? Meeting someone as unappreciative as you is my bad luck. But you cut a fine figure, brother, so I'll give you face — sixty-five thousand!”

“Ten thousand!”

“Sixty thousand!”

“Ten thousand!”

“Damn you — which enemy of mine sent you to toy with me? Believe it or not, I'll blink and cut you down!” The stall owner, thoroughly exasperated by Yang Kai's antics, drew a Saint King-Grade cleaver and, bristling with fury, pointed it at Yang Kai as if he would unleash slaughter at the slightest further provocation.

Yang Kai chuckled and immediately rose, sliding to one side.

“Crazy!” The vendor put away his treasure when Yang Kai moved off and shouted from a distance, “Don't let me see you again, or I'll beat you every time I do!”

“Sir…” Hua Youmeng appeared beside Yang Kai with a rueful look. “What on earth are you doing?”

She could hardly believe what she'd just seen: a Void King Realm expert bargaining for tens of thousands of Saint Crystals with a Saint King Realm warrior, failing to close the sale and even being driven off.

Was that truly a Void King Realm expert? How could the vendor be so arrogant if he knew whom he faced? She wondered what expression he would wear if he learned the truth.

“Just experiencing the local customs of Purple Star City — and passing the time a bit,” Yang Kai said with a grin. “Mm, though I must say, the cultivators of Purple Star City have rather short tempers.”

Hua Youmeng could only laugh and cry inwardly; anyone teased by Yang Kai so would hardly keep a pleasant temper.

“Let's go. First we'll handle the deeds at the Tongtian Auction House.” Yang Kai gestured. “You lead the way.”

“Yes.” Hua Youmeng answered and obediently led the way.

Yang Kai wandered about, glancing this way and that as if a country bumpkin who had never set eyes on a city before; everything seemed novel to him.

Hua Youmeng was truly bewildered; Yang Kai's behavior completely overturned her conception of a Void King Realm expert.

In her imagination such experts ought to be like Lu Tianfeng — lofty and haughty — yet Yang Kai mingled with the crowd as if an ordinary warrior, even beneath the comportment of a mere commoner; had she not known he was a Void King Realm expert, she would have doubted it.

After a short while, Hua Youmeng arrived at a beast-carriage depot and hired a carriage.

The carriage was drawn by two demonic beasts that resembled long, horse-like creatures; the cabin was spacious and quiet. Yang Kai and Hua Youmeng sat inside, and with a flick of the driver’s whip the carriage glided smoothly forward.

“These Snow-Stepping Shadow Beasts are all Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts. They don’t have much combat power, but their speed is excellent. So, Purple Star City keeps and breeds large numbers of them to serve as mounts for cultivators,” Hua Youmeng explained to Yang Kai inside the carriage. “Aerial flight isn’t permitted within the city, and with how vast it is, these beast carriages are quite popular. However, a single ride doesn’t come cheap — it costs five thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals.”

“Fifth-Tier demonic beasts…” Yang Kai nodded. “Purple Star is certainly lavish.”

Though Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts were nothing remarkable on their own, to fill an entire city with beast-drawn carriages like these would require tens of thousands of them at the very least. That was not something an ordinary force could possibly raise — Purple Star must surely possess some secret method for breeding and taming Demonic Beasts.

While speaking with Hua Youmeng, Yang Kai suddenly furrowed his brow and looked upward.

Under his gaze, the carriage's roof seemed as nothing, unable to block his sight.

“What's the matter?” Hua Youmeng cried when she saw his odd expression.

“Is fighting allowed inside Purple Star City?” Yang Kai asked in return.

“Of course not. Who would be so brazen as to act up here?” Hua Youmeng was astonished.

“Well then, this is interesting.” Yang Kai smiled faintly and waved; an invisible field flowed out from him, enveloping the entire carriage.

The next moment a violent commotion sounded in the sky, accompanied by several dull thuds.

Hua Youmeng's face changed; she felt a sudden chill of unease.

Thanks to Yang Kai's protection she had not been struck by the fallout from that skirmish, but being a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, she sensed immediately that those who had struck must include a Void King Realm expert.

She finally understood why Yang Kai had acted — he had clearly wished to prevent the beasts drawing the carriage from being startled.

After the fight the surrounding demonic beasts continued to shriek and run, yet the carriage carrying Hua Youmeng and Yang Kai remained calm and untroubled.

The driver peered about in puzzlement at the scene.

The clash had been quick, and when Hua Youmeng sent out her Divine Sense to probe, the sky was empty save for a slightly damaged warship floating above.

“Huh? That is…” Hua Youmeng's expression shifted as she lifted the carriage curtain and looked up; moments later her face turned grave and she hastily sank back down.

“What did you find?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Youmeng looked at him and said, “If I'm not mistaken, that warship belongs to the Hengluo Commerce Guild.”

“Hengluo Commerce Guild — are you certain?” Yang Kai was startled.

“Yes. The emblem on that warship is unmistakably Hengluo's!” Hua Youmeng nodded solemnly.

Yang Kai again sent out his Divine Sense and confirmed what Hua Youmeng had seen; that battered warship indeed bore a peculiar emblem he faintly recalled seeing on the garments of Xue Yue and Ni Guang.

Could it truly be Hengluo Commerce Guild's?

If so, then the warriors from Hengluo must have clashed with Purple Star City's side just now.

After a moment of thought Yang Kai said, “Why would Hengluo's warship come to Purple Star City?”

Hua Youmeng pursed her lips and smiled: “Though Hengluo's influence is vast, they are merchants at heart. Wherever there are warriors in this Star Domain, there is their business. Them coming to Purple Star City is not strange; as for why the two sides fought, that's beyond my conjecture.”

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly, glanced once more at the warship, then let the matter drop.

Whatever sordid business lay between those two great forces mattered little to him so long as it did not interfere with his plans.

The carriage pressed on, its speed like the wind.

Before long they arrived at a huge auction house.

Alighting, Hua Youmeng pointed ahead: “This is the Tongtian Auction House, one of the three largest auction houses in the outer city, very reputable. I hear in five days they will hold an auction with many rare lots appearing.”

Yang Kai gave a slight nod. After a moment, he turned to glance at Hua Youmeng and said, “President Hua, is this your first time here? You seem a little nervous.”

Hua Youmeng forced a smile. “It's not my first time here; I've come several times hoping to bid, but with little success — prices were always too high for me to afford. But consigning items to auction is a first; I don't know quite what to do.”

“With me by your side, don't be afraid!” Yang Kai gave her an encouraging look.

At that Yang Kai had said, Hua Youmeng calmed; after all, she had a Void King Realm expert beside her, and not an ordinary one at that — even Lu Tianfeng treated him with great deference. The Tongtian Auction House might be powerful, but they would hardly make trouble for someone consigning items, would they?

Besides, the reason she'd brought Yang Kai along was precisely to lean on his status for intimidation; a small Commerce Guild like theirs putting so many deeds on the market might otherwise stir up unnecessary trouble.

Thinking this, Hua Youmeng steadied herself and strode forward.
