## Chapter 834 — The Wait Was Not in Vain

Dragon Valley stretched and twisted like a true dragon coiled upon the earth; its interior was shrouded in mist year-round, obscuring sight— even the finest experts who entered could not see very far.

Around Dragon Valley many of Dragon-Phoenix Palace's experts had once lurked in hiding, but as time passed those experts all went about their own affairs.

Only the Palace Master Chen Zhou and a few others remained, standing guard and waiting at the valley's mouth.

At this moment Chen Zhou stared anxiously toward the valley floor, letting out a long, heavy sigh.

Two years earlier, when the disciple Sun Yu unlocked the valley's long-sealed restriction and produced the apparition of a golden dragon's head, the whole Dragon-Phoenix Palace had erupted in commotion.

The Palace's leadership turned their attention there, believing the sect might be revived—sure that before long it could stand again at the very summit of the continent, standing shoulder to shoulder with the greatest powers.

But two years passed with no further movement; although everyone sensed periodic, earth-shattering surges of power from within, the disciple Sun Yu never returned.

Gradually many grew disheartened; none dared speak plainly before the Palace master, but in private people speculated that Sun Yu's prospects were grim.

He was only at the seventh Stage of the True Yuan Realm; to have been gone so long, he likely starved to death within Dragon Valley—what reason was there to expect his survival?

Staring at that streak of golden light, Chen Zhou sighed once more.

"Master…" Yu Tingyi, Chen Zhou's companion, stood at his side and could not help but offer consolation. "If that disciple could open the restriction, then he must be a man of great opportunity—good fortune will favor the deserving."

Chen Zhou did not respond; worry clouded his face.

Yu Tingyi sighed helplessly and turned to look at the elderly man beside them.

Like Chen Zhou, that elder had waited here for two years, his eyes strained from watching.

He was the elder who had tutored Sun Yu—Ling Jian.

Elder Ling Jian was not powerful; within Dragon-Phoenix Palace he merely held the title of elder and possessed no real authority. He was often not well regarded.

After Sun Yu opened the restriction two years ago, Ling Jian's status rose sharply; nearly every elder treated him courteously, and he prospered within the Palace.

But now no one treated him with the same seriousness as before.

Chen Zhou and Ling Jian stood there staring at the valley floor, sighing back and forth with faces full of tangled worry.

A figure hurried over—it was another Palace elder, Xiao Ling—who, when close, covertly gauged Chen Zhou's expression and glanced at Yu Tingyi.

She slowly shook her head; her beautiful eyes were full of helplessness and melancholy.

Xiao Ling understood; he knew Dragon Valley had likely been unchanged in this time. After a moment's thought he clasped his hands and said, "Master, the elders request your presence to discuss an important matter."

"Discuss it without me; just tell me the result," Chen Zhou waved listlessly.

"But Master, this matter must be decided by you in person—we dare not overstep," Xiao Ling said with a troubled expression.

Chen Zhou frowned, showing some impatience.

Seeing this, Yu Tingyi quickly urged, "You should go once. You haven't attended to Palace affairs at all these past two years…"

"I will wait here for the Dragon Emperor's return!" Chen Zhou cut her off before she could finish.

Yu Tingyi smiled wryly.

"Do you lot think this time will be like before? Hmph. Foolish and ignorant— the Dragon Emperor will return, it's just that the time hasn't come yet!" Chen Zhou snorted coldly, his face wearing an expression of unwavering conviction.

Yu Tingyi smiled and followed his tone. "If you say he will return, then he will—but there's no need to force the hour. The elders are waiting for you; go and return quickly. Ling Jian and I will watch here; nothing will be neglected."

Chen Zhou glanced at her and, after a moment, slightly nodded. "Then be vigilant. Keep your eyes wide open."

"Mm." Yu Tingyi straightened, nodding seriously though she felt utterly helpless within.

Chen Zhou, still uneasy, cast another glance at the valley floor before preparing to leave with Xiao Ling.

At that moment the valley—silent for two years—suddenly erupted with staggering surges of energy; the gray, mist-filled gorge seemed swept by a gale and cleared in an instant.

The valley floor came into full view.

Chen Zhou's steps abruptly stopped; his body trembled with excitement as he fixed his gaze unwaveringly on the depths.

The gloomy Ling Jian watched just as closely; a flicker of eager hope lit his clouded eyes and his withered hands shook.

"There's movement!" Chen Zhou could not help but exclaim.

Xiao Ling, who had come to summon Chen Zhou, also halted and peered toward the valley, feeling a subtle thrill.

Although these elders had been displeased with the master's neglect of Palace matters over the past two years and suspected Sun Yu could not have survived, such a strange phenomenon filled Xiao Ling with expectation.

After all, he remained a member of Dragon-Phoenix Palace.

...

At the valley floor, within a world wrapped by a golden ocean of energy, the golden dragon finally devoured all the power; its body radiated blinding light, coiling like a true dragon and exuding endless majesty.

Sun Yu, who had been meditating, was startled and looked up; when his eyes met the dragon's basin-sized eye he froze, pain etched across his face.

In that instant he felt his soul nearly pulled from his sea of consciousness, on the verge of being shattered.

A figure flickered before him—Yang Kai stepped into his path. Sun Yu hurriedly closed his eyes, guarded his spirit, and silently circulated his inner art.

A high, resonant dragon roar sounded as the golden dragon surged into the heavens.

The clear sky seemed torn asunder, momentarily swallowing all light so that within a hundred li everyone could not see.

The golden dragon, as if freed after being trapped for thousands of years, now soared the heavens before suddenly diving with destructive force and striking Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave a muffled groan; in that instant he felt that which he had lost return to him.

It brought with it an unimaginably fearsome energy.

His garments were shattered into pieces, instantly reduced to dust.

Yang Kai reacted quickly, summoning several Vast Heaven Shields to envelop Sun Yu, and the silver-leaf Saint-Grade, Upper-Level secret treasure was cast outward as well.

Unusual ripples spread across the silver leaf, and in the blink of an eye it swelled vast and wrapped Sun Yu completely.

Under such raging force, had Yang Kai not acted, Sun Yu could not have withstood it and would have been utterly obliterated.

Over this long time Yang Kai had finally refined this secret treasure that belonged to the old Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; the silver leaf changed in myriad ways, its uses boundless—offense and defense alike—truly befitting its Saint-Grade, Upper-Level status.

Crack—crack—

A series of bone-shifting sounds echoed through Yang Kai's body; his flesh writhed and his True Yuan circulated at incredible speed, placing immense strain on his meridians.

In an instant countless cracks split Yang Kai's skin and blood flowed; bathed in the Demon God Golden Blood's powerful restoration, the damaged places were rapidly repaired.

Yet the internal surge of energy could not be stopped; his body was repeatedly torn and repaired, over and over.

Yang Kai remained composed; rather than showing pain he was radiant, invigorated.

When the golden dragon returned into his form as a dragon pattern, Yang Kai suddenly felt the world before his eyes shift subtly.

The energy that flowed through heaven and earth also felt different from before.

In the depths of his mind he seemed to glimpse traces of the Dao and the Martial Way; crucial points he had once been unable to grasp were now within reach.

Standing there, Yang Kai held his breath, closed his eyes, and quietly absorbed the revelations.

Above his head wind and clouds converged; within a hundred li the Heaven-and-Earth energy was being drawn by an invisible pull, furiously gathering toward this place.

Such violent cosmic phenomena naturally alarmed Dragon-Phoenix Palace's high ranks; nearly everyone poured out and gathered before Dragon Valley, staring dumbfounded.

Chen Zhou and Ling Jian, who had guarded here all along, had astonishing light in their eyes; the latter was moved to tears by excitement.

Although they still could not sense Sun Yu's aura, everyone knew this scene must be tied to him—perhaps he had successfully inherited the Dragon Emperor's legacy and was undergoing the final trial.

"Such violent energy fluctuations—this is a sign of a breakthrough!" Xiao Ling muttered.

Yu Tingyi nodded faintly: "A breakthrough comparable to Saint Realm experts!"

When Chen Zhou himself had broken into the Saint Realm years ago celestial phenomena had appeared, but compared to the present spectacle it paled.

Is the Dragon Emperor's inheritance truly so astonishing? When Sun Yu entered it two years ago he was only at the seventh Stage of the True Yuan Mirror—what could he possibly have reached now? It seems impossible to attain the Saint Realm in two years; could he withstand such brutal energy?

Concern spread among the gathered.

Chen Zhou suddenly shouted, "Order a lockdown: seal a thirty-li radius around our Palace—no outsiders may enter! If anyone dares force their way in, whoever they are, kill without mercy!"

Such a tremendous phenomenon would surely draw nearby experts; if villains coveting the Dragon Emperor's legacy arrived, unnecessary troubles would follow.

Especially the nearby Youhan Grotto-Heaven—two years ago they had been restless and employed various methods to probe Dragon Valley's news; with Sun Yu's fate unknown they had not acted openly.

But now that these celestial signs have appeared, they will surely make a move.

Seeing Chen Zhou's murderous resolve, Xiao Ling recognized the severity and hastened to carry out the orders.

"The Dragon Emperor's might has reappeared today—these two years were not wasted!" Chen Zhou's eyes glimmered with tears as if a burden had been lifted.
