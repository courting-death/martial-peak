## Chapter 559 — The Master Asked Me to Deliver a Message to You

The people from overseas never expected Yang Kai to be so easy to talk to. Their original intention was to take the treasures by force if their request was refused. After all, they were overseas forces, and no matter how powerful the Zhongdu Eight Great Families were, they could not interfere with them.

They planned simply to loot and then flee. Once back overseas, what did the Eight Great Families matter?

However, the aura of the powerful cultivators in Yang Kai’s mansion immediately invalidated Li Yuanchun’s and the others' original plan. If a fight did break out, victory was not guaranteed. Moreover, only the Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia had surfaced; they had no idea where the Tai Yi Seal or other treasures were.

If they dared to anger this Yang Family youth, courting mutual destruction would bring no benefits to anyone.

"This is only proper," Li Yuanchun, a crafty old fox, quickly agreed, then looked toward Yang Kai. "Might we be allowed to discuss matters further?"

Yang Kai smiled and motioned that he could wait a while.

The overseas persons exchanged glances and appeared to begin deliberating.

Yang Kai turned his gaze toward Bilo. "Bilo, why have you come over here?"

Bilo was holding onto Qiu Yimeng’s hand tightly, chatting away. Qiu Yimeng looked troubled, trying several times to withdraw her hand but to no avail. Hearing Yang Kai’s question, Qiu Yimeng's expression brightened immediately.

Bilo paused in surprise, then suddenly stood up. "I almost forgot. The Master asked me to deliver a message to you."

"What message?"

"Leave here immediately; the people from the Sacred Land are coming."

"What?" Yang Kai’s expression darkened instantly. "Coming here?"

"Right here," Bilo’s tone grew serious. "Taking advantage of the Yang Family’s succession war and the division of the Eight Great Families’ strength, they’re sweeping through War City first, then pressing toward Zhongdu. The six Masters have all been mobilized under the Evil Lord’s leadership, and the Sacred Land’s experts are all heading this way. You can’t hold them back in War City; you must leave immediately."

"When will they arrive here?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice, instantly sensing the gravity of the situation.

"Tonight!" Bilo said, unable to suppress a slight smile at the corner of her mouth.

"Such a huge matter, why not say anything earlier?" Yang Kai roared angrily. Seeing Bilo’s small look of triumph, he realized she was doing this on purpose.

If he hadn't asked, she might not have mentioned it.

This woman...

Yang Kai wished he could set her ablaze on the spot!

She was already doing him a favor by passing this message on under Shan Qingluo’s orders. Judging by how infatuated she was with Shan Qingluo, she probably wished he’d die sooner rather than later. Yang Kai was fully aware of her true feelings.

Qiu Yimeng was stunned for a long moment before asking, "You mean the Evil Lord is leading six evil kings here?"

"Yes, and most of the Sacred Land’s top experts as well," Bilo replied solemnly.

"How bold!" Qiu Yimeng’s face grew cold. "Do they really think the Eight Great Families are made of clay?"

"And you think you can resist?" Bilo looked at her mockingly. "If the Sacred Land dares to come here, they must have absolute confidence. I tell you, you won’t be able to stop them."

"How many beyond the Divine Roaming Realm are over there?" Qiu Yimeng stopped arguing and hurried to gather useful intel.

"About a dozen. Except for my Master’s territory, which has only one, there are at least two beyond the Divine Roaming Realm in each of the other Masters’ territories."

"Shan Qingluo has advanced as well?" Yang Kai was shocked. When they last parted over a year ago, she was at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. Now she had surpassed it.

The six evil kings of Cangyun Evil Land have always possessed power beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, each with extraordinary strength and terrifying skill.

If not, the siege on Cangyun Evil Land over a year ago would have succeeded.

"Only a dozen or so," Qiu Yimeng sneered. "Yet seven beyond Divine Roaming have appeared here in War City alone." Despite her words, she knew the situation was grim.

Bilo shook her head slowly, a disdainful look on her enchanting face. "It’s useless. Even if all beyond Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Eight Great Families appeared, they still couldn’t stop the Evil Lord. This Evil Lord is different. My Master said no one under heaven can match him. If he chooses, a single strike can defeat one beyond Divine Roaming, and three attacks can kill one."

Qiu Yimeng’s face changed dramatically.

"Moreover, under the Evil Lord serve the Thunder Beast King, Overlord King, Yinming Ghost King, Lightning Shadow King, Destruction Poison King, and Enchantress Queen. Of the six, my Master is the weakest," Bilo said calmly one by one.

"Yang Kai, what can we do?" Qiu Yimeng asked desperately, her mind thrown into chaos by this grave matter.

Without Yang Kai here, she might have held her own resolve. But with someone to rely on by her side, she had lost all judgment.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened as he regarded Bilo.

Bilo’s coming with this message was likely true. Though Shan Qingluo was also one of the six evil kings, from his interactions with her, Yang Kai knew she was essentially good-natured and would not have sent Bilo just to mock him.

"Qiu Yimeng, you and Huo Xingchen must go to Fengshen Hall immediately and inform the seven there of these developments," Yang Kai decided, voice firm.

"Understood," Qiu Yimeng nodded quickly then asked, "But what if they ask where this information came from...?"

"Tell them the truth."

Qiu Yimeng smiled bitterly. "Fine, I’ll go."

Those seven would definitely ask about the source. If told truthfully, whether they believed it or not, it would only strengthen suspicions that Yang Kai was colluding with demons.

Having ties even with the Enchantress Queen—what else is it but consorting with evil?

But with disaster impending, Yang Kai could hide nothing.

As Yang Kai made these arrangements, Bilo watched quietly on the sidelines, neither obstructing nor commenting, as if none of it concerned her.

After Qiu Yimeng left, Yang Kai hurried out as well.

"Young Master Yang..." Li Yuanchun called out in frustration. They had come so far to seek their sects’ treasured artifacts and were on the verge of reaching an agreement with Yang Kai, but now this sudden turn of events left them anxious.

What if Yang Kai died in the upcoming conflict? Whom would they turn to then?

"Everyone, hold on!" Yang Kai did not pause to heed them and disappeared at once after giving a command.

Li Yuanchun’s face darkened considerably.

The overseas crowd glared at Bilo together. Had she not brought this news, they would be negotiating peacefully with Yang Kai now.

Frightened under their stares, Bilo hastily slipped away.

Back in the courtyard, Yang Kai let out a clear whistle, and countless figures raced over.

"What is it, Young Master?" Tu Feng asked.

"Follow me," Yang Kai said without stopping his pace, heading swiftly toward Meng Wuya’s room while organizing his next plan.

Arriving at Meng Wuya’s place, he kicked open the door, ignoring the shopkeeper Meng’s angry reprimands, and fetched paper and brush to write a letter quickly.

"What’s the rush, why so panicked?" Meng Wuya grumbled. Ling Taixu came over as well, watching Yang Kai suspiciously.

"The folks from Cangyun Evil Land are coming here," Yang Kai briefly relayed the intelligence he had gathered. Everyone’s faces darkened instantly as they hastened to confirm the reliability of the news.

"Ninety percent certain," Yang Kai answered gravely, handing the letter raft to Ying Jiu. "You return to the Yang Family and deliver this letter to my father."

"Yes." Ying Jiu took the letter raft and vanishing in a flash.

Among all the Blood Servants, his speed was the fastest, so naturally, he was entrusted with this mission.

"What do you plan to do?" Meng Wuya inquired solemnly.

"Leave, leave quickly. There’s still some time," Yang Kai said, taking a deep breath. Though powerful cultivators appeared in the mansion, many were weak, especially among his friends. If caught in a war with Cangyun Evil Land, many could die here.

Cangyun Evil Land is well prepared this time. The Yang Family’s Succession War has divided the Eight Great Families’ strength over two cities. War City’s defenses are far weaker than Zhongdu’s, making it likely to be directly destroyed.

Remaining here would be unwise.

All he can do is send Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen to Fengshen Hall to alert the seven stationed there, so they understand the severity. And have Ying Jiu carry this letter back to the Yang Family, alerting his parents to prepare.

He had done all he could.

Hearing this, Meng Wuya nodded softly. "A wise choice."

"Tu Feng, issue commands throughout the mansion. Everyone must be ready within half an hour."

"Yes." Tu Feng responded immediately.

Soon, everyone in the mansion began to prepare. Though nobody knew exactly what was happening, Tu Feng’s grim expression conveyed the seriousness of the matter.

Young leaders from the new generation came to ask Yang Kai questions. Once they heard the answer, all looked dumbfounded.

"Impossible. Why hasn't any news leaked about Cangyun Evil Land’s massive mobilization?" Zuo Fang murmured.

Dong Qinghan’s face was grave as he said, "There are likely no survivors where they have passed."

Under the Evil Lord and six evil kings, with countless experts, wherever they tread is barren land, with scorched earth, broken walls, and a groaning earth. All minds quietly imagined the devastating scene.

A cold shiver ran through them.

An eagle’s cry rang out. Yang Kai released the golden-feathered eagle beside him, which had matured into a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast during its time in his mansion. Though its use had diminished as the Succession War advanced, it was normally a plaything for the girls.

Now, it was time for scouting.

Half an hour later, all preparations were complete.

Sensing the mansion’s abnormality, the overseas crowd hurriedly sought Yang Kai under Li Yuanchun’s leadership. Before they could speak, Yang Kai cut them off: "Sirs, no need to speak of your business yet. I promise your possessions will be returned, but not now. Why don't we set off together and talk along the way?"
