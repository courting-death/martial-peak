## Chapter 2416 — A Lifelong Secret Already Set

Although Zi Yu wanted to explain things clearly to Changsun Ying, she knew now was not the time for chatter. She could only decide to explain later, and gratefully said, "Thank you, Seventh Senior Aunt."

As soon as she finished speaking, she darted to Yang Kai's side, grabbed his hand, and urged anxiously, "Let’s hurry and go."

"We can’t get away!" Yang Kai suddenly gave a bitter smile, looking helplessly at Changsun Ying.

Changsun Ying clearly sensed something as well. Her delicate brows furrowed slightly, and her pretty face grew somber.

She had intercepted Yang Kai and Zi Yu here out of instinct—after all, as an elder of Ice Heart Valley, she couldn’t ignore suspicious activity within the valley.

But this interception and the earlier clash had obviously alerted many people, causing Yang Kai and Zi Yu to lose their best chance to escape.

She couldn’t help but feel guilty. If she’d known things would turn out this way, she would never have revealed herself to stop them.

Swish, swish, swish, swish…

A series of soft sounds rang out, and suddenly, a large group of Emperor Realm experts appeared around Yang Kai and the others. A rough count showed at least seven or eight, with more Emperor Realm experts hurrying over; they would arrive within a few breaths.

Among these Emperor Realm experts, none were Third Stage, and only two were Second Stage; the rest were all First Stage.

In an instant, Yang Kai was surrounded by beauties of all shapes and sizes, their graceful figures dazzling to behold.

It was truly a sea of beauties—three thousand fair maidens—with subtle fragrances wafting from every direction, making one feel as if they'd stepped into a realm of tenderness.

Yet Yang Kai felt no joy at all—his expression only grew more grave.

To be surrounded by so many Emperor Realm experts was a first for Yang Kai. Even with his mastery of Spatial Force, he wasn’t confident he could escape unscathed from this encirclement.

"Zi Yu, you’ve got some nerve! You dare consort with a man to escape the forbidden grounds, and even steal its treasure!" Just as Yang Kai was racking his brain for a way out, one of the Second Stage Emperor Realm experts suddenly shouted.

This woman, dressed as a beautiful matron in a pale blue dress, wore an icy expression, with a faint violent aura swirling around her, making her presence deeply uncomfortable. No one knew what secret art she cultivated, but standing there, she radiated sword intent that pierced the heavens, like a drawn blade brimming with danger.

Zi Yu panicked, quickly waving her hands at the matron, "No, Great Elder, you’ve misunderstood."

"Misunderstood?" The matron snorted coldly. "Am I blind? You were the only one in the forbidden grounds, yet the treasure is gone. Are you saying you didn’t take it?"

Zi Yu glanced at Yang Kai, but couldn’t say he’d taken the treasure, so she could only remain silent.

"Very well, so you admit it?" The matron sneered, then turned to another Second Stage Emperor Realm woman. "Zi Yu has broken sect rules, showed no remorse during confinement, and even stole the forbidden treasure. Senior Sister, please pass judgment!"

The other Second Stage Emperor Realm woman sighed softly, her gaze complex as she looked at Zi Yu, her beautiful eyes filled with guilt, self-reproach, and deep concern. After a long moment, she spoke: "Yu’er, that Ice Pearl was left by your ancestor. Why did you take it?"

She clearly believed Zi Yu had stolen the Ice Pearl, since it had been in the forbidden grounds before, but now was missing.

Zi Yu opened her mouth and said, "Master, I didn’t take it."

She only defended herself against the accusation, refusing to implicate Yang Kai, clearly not wanting to drag him down with her.

"Then how did it disappear?" Zi Yu’s master asked gently. Compared to the imposing Second Stage Emperor Realm expert from before, she was much more gentle and caring, her voice soft and tender.

Yang Kai suddenly asked in a low voice, "Junior Sister Yu, how should I address these two?"

Zi Yu replied instinctively, "One is my master, An Ruoyun. The other is my Ice Heart Valley's Great Elder, Sun Yunxiu, who is also my Second Senior Aunt. My master ranks first among all the Senior Sisters."

Yang Kai understood—so the gentle woman was Zi Yu’s master, the acting Valley Lord of Ice Heart Valley, An Ruoyun, and the sword-intent-filled, imposing woman was Sun Yunxiu. Both were Senior Sisters to Changsun Ying, whom Yang Kai had met earlier.

Bing Yun truly raised a fine group of disciples. Each one had reached the Emperor Realm—whether it was the land that nurtured them or her teaching, it was hard to say.

But now wasn’t the time for such thoughts. Yang Kai cupped his fists and said, "I am Yang Kai, greetings to all the seniors."

"Who do you think you are, daring to break into Ice Heart Valley at night and abduct our disciple!" Sun Yunxiu’s expression turned cold as she shouted.

Yang Kai frowned slightly. "Elder Sun, you must be mistaken. I didn’t abduct Junior Sister Yu—I was entrusted to take her away. Your attitude makes it clear you don’t care much for Zi Yu, likely one of those who yielded under Wenqing Sect’s pressure."

"You dare talk back!" Sun Yunxiu’s face darkened.

Just then, two figures suddenly descended from the sky, landing nearby. One of them looked at Zi Yu and exclaimed, "Young Sister Yu, what are you doing!"

His face twisted in anguish, as if his heart had been shattered, disappointment written all over as he looked at Zi Yu. But when his gaze shifted to Yang Kai, it brimmed with hatred, murderous intent surging from his very being.

Both newcomers were men—one a Second Stage Emperor Realm, dignified and imposing; the speaker was a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, handsome and extraordinary.

Their identities were obvious. The only male guests in Ice Heart Valley now were Wenqing Sect’s Vice Sect Master Yao Zhuo and Young Sect Master Feng Xi.

The two had clearly been drawn by the commotion, but as soon as they landed, Feng Xi saw Zi Yu holding Yang Kai’s hand—worse, she was the one who’d reached for him!

This discovery made his face instantly darken, as if he’d been deeply humiliated. His Qi and blood churned, ready to explode. No woman he’d ever fancied had treated him this way; any woman he conquered became a slave, his word absolute—no one had ever dared defy him.

But Zi Yu never showed him any affection, and now, this wretched girl was so intimate with a stranger. Wasn’t this a direct insult? If word got out, how could he ever show his face in the Northern Territory again? He’d be mocked wherever he went.

Seeing Feng Xi’s gaze fall on her hand, Zi Yu instantly realized her mistake.

Earlier, she’d grabbed Yang Kai’s hand to escape, not thinking much of it. But before she could react, the Senior Aunts had arrived and surrounded them, leaving no way out. In her tension, she’d forgotten to let go.

Now, as she came to her senses, she clearly felt the broad warmth of Yang Kai’s palm, and her pretty face flushed red. Instinctively, she started to let go.

But for some reason, just as she was about to release him, her jade hand gripped even tighter and, this time, she interlaced her fingers with Yang Kai’s.

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise, a strange feeling rising in his heart.

Zi Yu’s face was tinged with pink, her soft body leaning against Yang Kai’s arm. She looked provocatively at Feng Xi and said, "Young Sect Master, mind your manners. Young Sister Yu isn’t yours to command, and what I do is my own business—you have no right to interfere!"

Feng Xi’s already ugly face turned ashen, his eyes blazing as he glared at Yang Kai, gritting his teeth. "You’re courting death, boy! How dare you touch my woman!"

Yang Kai let out a cold laugh. He knew exactly why Zi Yu was being so affectionate—it was clearly to provoke Feng Xi. He didn’t mind her actions; unable to control her own fate, Zi Yu could only resist in small ways, hoping to make Feng Xi give up. But instead, she’d only fueled his rage and killing intent.

"Who’s your woman? Shameless!" Zi Yu didn’t spare him any respect, immediately cursing him when he threatened Yang Kai.

Feng Xi’s face turned white with anger. Unable to argue with Zi Yu, he vented his fury on Yang Kai, glaring viciously. "Is this all you’ve got, boy? You can only hide behind a woman?"

Yang Kai grinned. "Young Sect Master, a forced melon isn’t sweet—why bother? Junior Sister Yu and I have long been devoted to each other, our lifelong promise already set. So tell me, who’s stealing whose woman? I won’t stoop to your level, but you’re the one crying thief while being the thief yourself. How does that make sense?"

With those words, the whole crowd was stunned.

All the Emperor Realm experts of Ice Heart Valley stared at Yang Kai and Zi Yu, mouths agape, as if they couldn’t believe it.

Zi Yu was also momentarily dazed. She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to say such things in front of so many people—talking about lifelong promises and such. Wasn’t this ruining her reputation? Instantly, her face flushed crimson, burning with shame, as if she’d truly done something outrageous with Yang Kai.

Seeing her changing expression, the Emperor Realm experts of Ice Heart Valley exchanged strange looks.

Seventh Senior Aunt Changsun Ying even looked at Yang Kai with approval, as if to say, “Well done.” It was her first time meeting Yang Kai, so she had no strong feelings about him, but his bold words made her think Zi Yu had chosen well.

If it wasn’t sincere, how could he be so brazen before so many Emperor Realm experts?

On the other side, Feng Xi’s face darkened as if a layer of frost had settled over it. He felt utterly miserable—he’d never imagined the woman he wanted, even using sect power to claim, had already become someone else’s plaything!

It was like swallowing a dead fly—disgusting and unbearable. His gaze toward Zi Yu was now full of loathing.
