## Chapter 1392 — Obstinately Unrepentant

Xie Li's gaze was icy as he swept it across the two women at the head, a sneer curling the corner of his mouth.

More of the warriors, however, revealed darker intentions; some lechers ogled the two women with lascivious eyes, tracing their graceful forms as if the pair were already in their pockets, merely awaiting the moment the formation collapsed to rush forward, abduct them, and violate them at will.

The two women wore indifferent expressions, showing not the slightest hint of fear.

Xie Li recognized their identities at a glance. Having probed Dragon Lair Mountain's background, he knew one of the women was called Wu Yi, a disciple of the local Haike Family who later left her clan to join Dragon Lair Mountain, while the other, Qian Yue, seemed to have been brought back by Yang Kai from somewhere.

Their cultivation was nothing remarkable: one at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, the other at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, not even catching Xie Li's attention.

Of the three elders standing behind them, two were certainly Chang Qi and Hao An; these two had once been Guest Elders of the Haike Family and had visited Flowing Flame Sandland, where they unexpectedly obtained some opportunity and both broke through to the Origin Returning Realm, later joining Dragon Lair Mountain.

As for the last man, Xie Li eyed him suspiciously; when he made out the other's face, he exclaimed in surprise, "Brother Ning, how are you here?"

The white‑haired elder was none other than Ning Xiangchen, the very man who had gone to the Imperial Garden with Yang Kai.

He was, admittedly, in an awkward spot: after returning from the Imperial Garden and receiving Yang Kai's promise, he had spent his time gathering refining materials, intending to borrow Yang Kai's Fire Bird Artifact Spirit to repair his own Origin‑Grade Secret Treasure.

He had finally assembled the necessary components and hurried here, only to discover Yang Kai had gone out and not returned.

Left with no choice, he could only remain inside the mountain and wait.

Before he had even warmed his seat, the Xie Family had already begun attacking Dragon Lair Mountain.

Ning Xiangchen found himself in an awkward position: staying was ill advised, for should Dragon Lair Mountain's protective mountain array be broken he would inevitably be dragged into the disaster; yet leaving immediately would look cold and ungrateful, and then he would have no hope of borrowing Yang Kai's Fire Bird Artifact Spirit to repair his treasure.

Ning Xiangchen was caught between a rock and a hard place, unable to advance or retreat.

He had no Sect, no family—he'd climbed to his current realm entirely by himself, enduring countless near‑deaths; the path of cultivation had been thorny at every step.

Back when Master Gelin of Yingyue Hall was alive, any damage to a Secret Treasure would repaired by him. The master was approachable and easy to speak with; Ning Xiangchen had benefited greatly from his care over the years. Aside from Master Gelin, however, he knew of no other Origin‑Grade artificer. Had that not been the case, he would never have thought to ask Yang Kai for help.

Ning Xiangchen waited anxiously within Dragon Lair Mountain for two days while the attackers bombarded the place; during those two days he noticed something odd.

The warriors inside Dragon Lair Mountain remained utterly composed despite being besieged—they each performed their duties, training where they should, acting where they must, as if the commotion outside and the enemy forces did not exist.

One or two fighters behaving that way could be explained as having steady temperament, but when everyone acted alike, it became strange.

Especially the two young women, Wu Yi and Qian Yue; these past days they were calmer than anyone, sipping tea and chatting from time to time—did they not know how to write the character for death?

Ning Xiangchen was shocked and deeply impressed; compared to his own anxious, grasping mood, these juniors' composure was extraordinary.

What truly made Ning Xiangchen look at Dragon Lair Mountain differently was that its protective mountain array, after being ferociously assaulted for two days by more than thirty Origin Returning Realm practitioners and more than two hundred Saint King Realm warriors, still held solid as iron.

This little mountain was not simple!

Even the protective array alone was not something an ordinary person could have set up.

Thinking of Yang Kai's many displays in the Imperial Garden, Ning Xiangchen gritted his teeth and decided to take a gamble: he would stay and fight alongside Dragon Lair Mountain. All signs suggested this little mountain was not a soft target, and it might hide some devastating contingency capable of turning the tide.

Ning Xiangchen's choice was not born of chivalry but of a calculated wager.

He bet Dragon Lair Mountain would weather this crisis; if it did, he could properly request Yang Kai's Fire Bird Artifact Spirit to repair his Secret Treasure—otherwise he would owe a debt and feel ill at ease.

At that moment, following Wu Yi and Qian Yue out to meet the enemy was Ning Xiangchen's own request; no one had summoned him.

Hearing Xie Li's question, Ning Xiangchen chuckled, "Brother Xie, long time no see. I heard you've left Yingyue Hall?"

"Brother Ning, why ask a question you already know the answer to?" Xie Li snorted coldly; the other was a man without Sect or clan, and even as an Origin Returning Realm cultivator Xie Li held him in little regard. The two had met before, so a few words were exchanged. "Since you're here, Brother Ning, I have a proposal—might you consider it?"

"Oh? What do you propose, Brother Xie?" Ning Xiangchen's brow twitched.

Xie Li's eyes flicked over Qian Yue and Wu Yi, then he sent his voice through Divine Sense: "Brother Ning, you can see the situation. Against so many allied forces, this little mountain is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot; once the array is broken, Dragon Lair Mountain will be fish on the chopping board. I don't know what favors Dragon Lair Mountain has offered you, but I am willing to pay double if you capture these two women and hand them over for my disposal. With your means, taking them by surprise should be no trouble, right?"

Ning Xiangchen lifted his white brows, a faint, almost smiling expression on his face as he said loudly, "Brother Xie, though I have no Sect and am a lone soldier, I know what honesty and loyalty are. To ambush two juniors from behind would be shameful. If I truly committed such a disgraceful act, I'm afraid I would have no place left in this world to take shelter."

Hearing Ning Xiangchen’s words, Xie Li’s face darkened. The other party hadn’t sent him a secret voice transmission but had instead voiced his proposal openly before everyone, deliberately denying Xie Li any face. This greatly infuriated him.

Ning Xiangchen continued at leisure, "Moreover, Brother Xie needn't exaggerate. There may be many here seeking to provoke trouble, but breaking this array won't be achieved in a day or two. Hmm, also mixing myself into this is my own decision; no one has offered me any reward, so you will be disappointed."

When Xie Li had sent his proposal privately, Wu Yi and Qian Yue had looked nervous, fearing Ning might be bought over; neither knew him well. Hearing his words now, they visibly relaxed and showed gratitude.

Chang Qi laughed heartily and patted Ning Xiangchen on the shoulder: "Brother Ning, you'll be glad you made this choice."

Hao An smiled warmly, suddenly feeling the old man more affable.

Ning Xiangchen outwardly remained composed, but inside his heart was uneasy—his decision also came from disliking Xie Li and his ilk bullying the weak. Now that they'd torn the veil between them, if Dragon Lair Mountain fell he wouldn't reap any good of it.

Wu Yi pursed her lips into a serene smile, her expression calm yet somehow unfathomable. Parting her vermilion lips, she said, "Senior Xie, and all of you elders, Dragon Lair Mountain has no grievance with you; why press us so cruelly?"

"No grievance?" Xie Li sneered, a feral smile on his face. "If there were truly no grievance, do you think we'd attack a little mountain for sport? I won't haggle with you young ones too much. Little girl, if you're sensible, dismantle that protective array and spare yourselves some physical suffering; otherwise…"

"Otherwise what?" Wu Yi raised her willow‑like head, her beautiful eyes fixed on Xie Li without a trace of fear.

Xie Li snorted and said, "When the array falls, we'll flay you and pull out your tendons!"

“What bold words, Senior—aren’t you afraid the wind might split your tongue?” Wu Yi still wore a serene smile, yet her words dripped with biting mockery. Her beautiful eyes flashed as she swept a glance over the many enemies glaring fiercely at her. In a clear, ringing voice, she declared, “Since that’s how it is, this Junior will also offer some advice to all you Seniors: if you leave now, my Dragon Lair Mountain will let bygones be bygones, and this incident shall be treated as if it never happened. But if you remain obstinate and refuse to turn back, then don’t blame my Dragon Lair Mountain for acting ruthless!”

Her words struck like thunder.

The numerous Origin Returning Realm attackers stared at Wu Yi as if she were an idiot, rage rising in their chests.

After hammering at the array for two days with no success, their frustrations were high; hearing Wu Yi's brash words only fanned their ire further.

None of the attackers had come without ulterior motives—many bore grudges against Yang Kai—and they would not be cowed by a few hot words from Wu Yi. If anything, her speech bolstered their resolve.

Immediately, some hotheaded ones drove out Secret Treasures or unleashed Martial Skills toward the direction where Wu Yi stood.

Thunder roared...

A tremendous boom rang out as the array's luminous curtain before Wu Yi flashed wildly, intercepting and nullifying every attack.

Wu Yi's face went cold as she stared at the warriors who had struck at her, saying in a harsh voice, "Since you persist in your obstinacy, let us wait and see. I hope you will not regret today's decision!"

Saying this, she waved her hand and a thick mist surged from all directions, enveloping Wu Yi and the others, swallowing their figures and erasing them from the attackers' sight.

"That insolent little wench—when I catch her, I'll make her know what it means to wish she were dead!" spat an Origin Returning Realm elder who sat cross‑legged atop a huge toad‑like demonic beast, glaring viciously toward the place where Wu Yi had vanished.

The elder was hideously ugly—triangular eyes, bulbous nose, bald head, a pockmarked, squat body—so well matched to the toadlike demonic beast he rode that they completed each other's grotesqueness.
