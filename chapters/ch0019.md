## Chapter 19 — Su Mu Comes to Cause Trouble

After settling the little boy, Yang Kai did not rush to leave. After all, that night the boy had given him a portion of food, and Yang Kai wanted to wait until he woke before departing with peace of mind.

The hunter busied himself inside, nervously pacing back and forth, until he was soon driven out by the clinic’s physician—deemed too noisy to remain.

“Physician Chu said it was fortunate the treatment was timely, or else my son would have truly lost his life. Benefactor, I, Zhang Shan, have no way to repay your great kindness. This lifetime, I will serve you like a beast of burden, at your every command.”

With that, he knelt before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not help him up, but smiled and said, “Brother Zhang, a son’s knees are worth their weight in gold. Your kneeling has already repaid the debt. There is no need to dwell on it further. Besides, I ate a portion of your son’s food, so in truth, I am the one who owes you.”

Having said this, he helped Zhang Shan to his feet.

Zhang Shan was deeply moved, tears streaming down his face. “Benefactor, you truly are a good man!”

As they spoke, the clinic’s physician emerged and told Zhang Shan, “There is no grave danger now, so do not worry. However, he lost a great deal of blood and will likely remain unconscious for some time. Once he wakes, he will be fine.”

Hearing this, both Yang Kai and Zhang Shan finally relaxed.

Once his mind eased, Yang Kai felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him. Today had been far too intense, and he had sustained many injuries, bleeding heavily. Although he had been excited at the time, the toll on his body was undeniable. As soon as he relaxed, he fell into a deep sleep, not waking until dawn.

Morning came to Lingxiao Pavilion.

Many disciples had risen early, their hearts filled with excitement as they gathered, eyes fixed expectantly on one spot. Their eager gazes, stretched necks, and restless spirits resembled a group of wives anxiously awaiting the long-awaited return of their husbands from a distant campaign—so focused, so full of anticipation.

As time passed, more and more people gathered, all instinctively turning their attention to the same direction.

That direction was the small hut where Yang Kai resided.

Today was once again a day to challenge Yang Kai! How could the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion pass up the chance to claim those nearly free Contribution Points? Some felt sympathy for Yang Kai’s plight—after all, being beaten every five days was truly pitiful.

But upon reflection, mere sympathy was useless. So many sought to challenge Yang Kai that if one did not, another surely would. Since he was going to be beaten anyway, better to be the one to strike first. With this thought, they gathered, hoping for a stroke of luck.

“Of course, if I am chosen, I will go easy on him, so as not to hurt him too badly,” many told themselves, finding excuses in their hearts.

At this hour, Yang Kai would normally already be up sweeping the grounds, but today was strange. The disciples waited a long while but saw no sign of him. They stood on tiptoe, peering toward the hut, yet no figure appeared.

“What’s going on with Yang Kai? Did he oversleep? Why hasn’t he come out yet?”

“I don’t know. Come to think of it, I haven’t seen him these past few days.”

“Could he have left Lingxiao Pavilion already?”

“Impossible. You know Yang Kai’s stubbornness. He wouldn’t leave even if beaten to death. If he wanted to leave, he would have done so months ago when he was demoted to Trial Disciple. Why drag it out until now?”

The gathered disciples murmured among themselves, unaware that Yang Kai had taken leave several days ago to visit Black Wind Mountain and had yet to return. It was no wonder, for Yang Kai rarely mingled with others, and his movements naturally went unnoticed.

Amidst the chatter, a group approached from a short distance away. At their head was a youth with a face like polished jade, handsome and graceful, exuding an air of effortless charm. Yet, for some reason, his expression was dark and sullen, and as he walked, he ground his teeth, cursing someone under his breath.

Surrounding this youth were many Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, forming a protective circle around him, making him stand out even more.

Upon arriving, the youth frowned at the large crowd and asked, “What’s going on? Why are there so many people here?”

One of his companions hurried forward and whispered, “Young Master Su, today is the day to challenge Yang Kai, so the brothers have gathered here, waiting to claim Contribution Points.”

The youth called Su Shao raised an eyebrow and laughed heartily. “Looks like our Brother Yang is living a life of hardship.”

His words dripped with schadenfreude and delight.

“Yes, he basically gets beaten every five days, and only stops when he’s knocked unconscious,” the companion explained.

Su Shao laughed again. “I don’t know why, but this grievance in my heart feels somewhat relieved. But that’s not enough. I will drive him out of Lingxiao Pavilion. Once he is no longer a disciple here, I can do whatever I want with him.”

“Su Shao speaks truly. That brat dared to ruin your plans in Wumei Town, as if he didn’t know how many eyes the Horse King Lord has. He should have investigated who you are before acting so recklessly!”

The flattery pleased Su Shao greatly, and he nodded repeatedly.

Su Shao was none other than Su Mu, the youth Yang Kai had encountered in Wumei Town. That day, Su Mu had conspired with two thugs to stage a double act, only to be exposed by Yang Kai. Humiliated and enraged, Su Mu left in a huff and began investigating Yang Kai’s identity upon returning to Lingxiao Pavilion.

He had some means and channels, and within a day had uncovered Yang Kai’s background. However, bound by the sect’s strict rules, he could not act directly. Only today did he bring people to cause trouble for Yang Kai, only to find so many gathered here, all fixated on Yang Kai.

This displeased Su Mu. He waved his hand and said, “Let them disperse. Tell them I, Su Mu, will take on Yang Kai today.”

The words sounded as if Yang Kai were a courtesan at a brothel, selling both art and body.

One of his followers stepped forward and bowed to the crowd. “Brothers, the battle with Yang Kai today has been decided by Young Master Su Mu. Please grant us this courtesy and wait here. We apologize for the inconvenience and ask for your understanding.”

At this, many were startled and turned to look at Su Mu. Some who did not understand shouted, “Why him? Yang Kai always uses a broom to select his opponents. Why should it be you? There should be a first-come, first-served order!”

Before the words had fallen, someone pulled the speaker aside and whispered, “That’s Su Mu. Do you know who he is?”

“Who?”

“This is foolish. We have an elder surnamed Su in Lingxiao Pavilion, and among the top ten Core Disciples, there is also one named Su. Who do you think he is?”

Though the words were veiled, the listeners were no fools and immediately fell silent. As mere Outer Disciples, knowing Su Mu had such backing, none dared to make a fuss.

“Winning against Yang Kai doesn’t even earn many Contribution Points. It’s not worth offending him.”

“Yes, yes,” the listener agreed, breaking out in a cold sweat.
