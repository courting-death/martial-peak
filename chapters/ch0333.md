## Chapter 333 — Avoiding Crisis

Ahead, unknown dangers loomed, but retreating or moving sideways was utterly impossible; they could only forge ahead blindly.

After running for several li, everyone suddenly halted, their eyes trembling as they gazed forward.

In front of them lay a vast expanse filled with dense clusters of Purple Evil Spirits, swirling back and forth like malevolent wraiths. Something was clearly amiss, as they were engaged in a relentless battle amongst themselves.

Moreover, from all directions, more and more Purple Evil Spirits were converging towards them, creating a scene that was nothing short of heart-stopping.

Even Yang Kai was taken aback by this sight, let alone those from Ghost King Valley and Xiaoyao Sect.

Although he cultivated the True Yang Technique, which restrained evil spirits, the sheer number of these spirits was overwhelming. If they all charged at once, Yang Kai estimated he would have no chance to resist.

In an instant, a profound despair filled many hearts, their eyes overflowing with terror and dread, left dumbfounded in place, unsure of what to do.

With wolves in front and tigers behind, there was simply no place to go; they were essentially in a realm of despair!

“Brother Yang! Brother Yang!” A sudden urgent call echoed from nearby, seemingly shouting for Yang Kai.

Upon hearing the voice, Yang Kai turned to see Tao Yang, whom he had met before, drenched in sweat and waving at him.

At this moment, he was on a high platform that appeared to be naturally formed, resembling a towering stone pillar, standing within the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave. The top of this pillar was a smooth surface, about seven or eight zhang high.

Beside Tao Yang, three Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters had gathered, their expressions filled with panic.

In addition, there was another such high platform not far away.

“Head over there!” Yang Kai's eyes brightened as he led Leng Shan and the others towards that platform. Yu Qing and the others, seeing a glimmer of hope, hurriedly followed.

In this critical moment of life and death, Yang Kai cared little for anything else. As a few erratic Purple Evil Spirits approached, he launched them away with his True Yang Yuan Qi.

Charging through and wreaking havoc, he finally broke through the encirclement of numerous evil spirits and leaped onto the high platform where Tao Yang stood alongside the others from Ghost King Valley.

The platform wasn't particularly large. With Tao Yang's group already having four members, the arrival of the seven or eight from Ghost King Valley made it feel somewhat cramped. While not exactly crowded, it certainly could not accommodate the people from Xiaoyao Sect.

Upon reaching the high platform, Yang Kai abruptly turned around, coldly staring at Yu Qing and the others.

Fortunately, they were self-aware enough to know that it was impossible for others to make room for them at this moment.

Thus, they simply rotated to the side, each summoning their secret treasures to protect themselves as they headed towards a distant empty high platform.

The secret treasures emitted brilliant lights within the dim cave, each one fire attribute or sparking with electric arcs. Only these types of attacks could restrain the evil spirits.

Countless evil spirits flitted below the platform, screeching and attacking one another as if driven mad. Meanwhile, the platform above remained extremely safe, untouched by the chaos below, leaving everyone puzzled as to what mysteries this platform concealed.

“Brother Yang, we meet again.” Tao Yang smiled wryly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai looked back, clasping his fists in gratitude, “Thank you.”

“Brother Yang is too polite.”

“How did you end up here?”

“Like you, I was chased here...” Tao Yang laughed awkwardly. It turned out that he had been traveling behind Yang Kai with his three Junior Brothers and Sisters. However, they encountered nothing along the way, and the path they took was pristine, devoid of any evil spirits.

With no other options, Tao Yang had to change course, eventually venturing into the territory of the Purple Evil Spirits. Upon encountering a lone Purple Evil Spirit, before they could take action, a change occurred.

A large group of evil spirits chased them, and by the time they fled to this place, they were alerted and quickly ascended the platform for refuge.

“Are there others here?” Yang Kai questioned, scanning the area. He discovered two slender figures sitting cross-legged on another high platform roughly a mile away.

In ordinary circumstances, Yang Kai would have easily discerned every detail from a mile away, but deep underground, his vision was obstructed, and all he knew was that they were two women.

“It’s the two from Xiaoyao Sect who were pursuing us,” Leng Shan remarked softly, glancing toward them.

Yang Kai nodded faintly.

“Are these friends you recently made?” Tao Yang curiously eyed the people from Ghost King Valley. Seeing Yang Kai, who had previously entered the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave alone, now gather with a group seemed rather strange to him.

“Oh, I have known them for a while. I didn’t expect to run into them here.” Yang Kai offered an explanation.

Tao Yang chuckled lightly, “It seems Brother Yang has acquaintances everywhere! To meet a friend here is impressive! I am Tao Yang from Baoqi Sect!”

“Baoqi Sect?” Shen Yi exclaimed, his eyes gleaming with surprise, while Leng Shan also gazed at Tao Yang, evidently having heard of this sect before.

“My apologies, I didn’t recognize you were from Baoqi Sect, we are from Ghost King Valley, Shen Yi!” 

“Brother Shen!” Tao Yang laughed, showing no change in demeanor despite Ghost King Valley's reputation as an evil sect.

Surprised, Yang Kai looked at Tao Yang, not expecting him to hail from Baoqi Sect.

Baoqi Sect…

A rather unique sect.

Also a very small sect.

There were only around a hundred members in the entire sect, not even qualifying as a third-rate sect, merely existing at the lowest tier. Yet, its name held significant weight, not being outshone by Yao Wang Valley.

While Yao Wang Valley was famed for alchemy, Baoqi Sect was known for artifact forging!

Among the few high-quality Mystic-Grade treasures in the world, half originated from Baoqi Sect.

Baoqi Sect's method of forging was unique, distinctively showcasing their style. Though small, it had a remarkable reputation.

Every year, Baoqi Sect only forged about twenty items!

But these were all above Heavenly Grade, highly sought after by various forces.

The heads of smaller families and sects often did not possess as many treasures or of such high quality as those brought by Baoqi Sect’s disciples.

Thus, it was humorously said that any disciple of Baoqi Sect was akin to a walking treasure.

Previously, Yang Kai had not paid much attention to this group of people. Now, hearing Tao Yang identify himself as a disciple of Baoqi Sect, he looked them over more closely and discovered it was indeed the case. The outfits they wore, the jewelry the women adorned, the weapons they held, and the jade pendants at their waists, all sported remarkable quality as treasures.

Seeing Tao Yang openly declare his identity as a Baoqi Sect disciple suggested he was genuinely interested in befriending them, unwilling to hide his background.

In light of this candor, Yang Kai felt no need to conceal his own identity any longer, clasping his fists and stating, “I am Yang Kai from Lingxiao Pavilion…”

Upon these words, the crowd was astonished, staring incredulously at Yang Kai, their expressions of utter disbelief evident.

Leng Shan slowly shook her head, as if she anticipated the reaction that would arise from Yang Kai's declaration.

“Holy cow!” Cheng Ying muttered, her eyes almost popping out of her head.

Shen Yi remained dumbfounded for a while before bursting into hearty laughter, “What an eye-opener! Today, I have truly broadened my horizons.”

With that, he lowered his voice, “I didn’t realize your Lingxiao Pavilion was so formidable; every single person who comes out is impressive!” 

First, there was the Evil Lord from Lingxiao Pavilion, and now Yang Kai was also a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. How could this not astonish them, as merely the fact that he shared the same sect as the Evil Lord was enough to command attention.

“We at Ghost King Valley are immensely grateful for your candor today!” Shen Yi said solemnly.

“Hey, hey, hey…” Leng Shan interrupted, “Do you men even understand the current situation? Can we put aside other matters for now and figure out how to resolve this immediate crisis? I just don’t comprehend what’s going through your heads.”

“Exactly!” The girl from Baoqi Sect nodded rapidly in agreement.

Several exchanged bitter smiles. Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and turned to Tao Yang, asking, “Brother Tao, since you arrived earlier, do you have any understanding of the situation?”

“I don’t have much understanding. We came here because the Master wanted some evil spirit essence for forging. Before we could acquire it, this trouble arose, and we ran all the way here. Just a little while after you showed up.” 

“Oh.” Yang Kai frowned, glancing down. The evil aura swirled like thick ink, resembling a cloud that obscured the ground. The Purple Evil Spirits navigated through this miasma, absorbing it to strengthen themselves, while engaging in combat with other spirits. Occasionally, some evil spirits would be slain, leaving behind enticing essences that glimmered with soft light.

In that brief moment, there were already about ten collections of evil spirit essence below, and as time passed, more spirits were vanquished, leading to even greater quantities of essence produced.

Everyone's eyes heated as they stared longingly at those essences, yet no one dared to rush down to seize one.

To say nothing of the numerous evil spirits potentially attacking, just getting caught in that thick miasma would surely yield no good outcome.

“If you genuinely wish to learn more, I believe we should inquire with those two girls over there. We only managed to avoid danger thanks to their kind reminder, so they should know more than I do,” Tao Yang suggested, glancing in the distance.

“Shen Yi!” Yu Qing clearly also spotted the two girls’ hiding place. He stared intently for a long moment, a smug and sinister smile curling at the corner of his mouth. Then he turned to Ghost King Valley’s group, shouting, “If you can capture those two girls for me, Huangquan Pool will be open to you for two months!”

Shen Yi scoffed coldly, “Yu Qing, have you gone mad? This is not a place for you to indulge in whimsy while your own life hangs in the balance! You should be thinking about how to survive first.” 

Yu Qing replied with a chilling smile, “Even if I die, I want them to die under my hands!”

“Idiot!” Shen Yi spat vehemently, his face filled with disdain.

“Don’t waste your breath on him. If we manage to survive this ordeal, I’ll never work with him again,” Leng Shan said with extreme disgust.

Clearly, the conversation between Shen Yi and Yu Qing reached the ears of the two women on the other high platform, who exchanged wary glances, their expressions fraught with vigilance. 

Yang Kai furrowed his brows and stood, declaring, “I’ll go ask them.” 

“Ah… it’s too dangerous!” Shen Yi exclaimed. Currently, with evil spirits everywhere, only the high platform remained relatively safe. Leaving it could very well lead to unforeseen dangers.
