## Chapter 2333 — Opportunity

Yang Kai immediately understood that the fellow did not fully trust him; fearing he might covet the ring's treasures, he had placed a bloodline restriction on it.

Of course, Ye Chong was not targeting him specifically; this restriction had certainly been set tens of thousands of years ago.

Even so, Yang Kai felt a bit uncomfortable.

Clearly, he was being asked to deliver something, yet treated as if he were a thief—who could feel good about that?

However, Yang Kai did not show it. He accepted the ring and said, "Senior, rest assured, I will definitely deliver it to Sect Master Ye."

"Very good, very good!" Ye Chong let out a long breath, as if a great weight had been lifted from his heart, and continued, "Of course, this Lord will not let you help for nothing."

Hearing this, Yang Kai's eyes lit up. He knew the other party was about to offer a reward and immediately looked forward to it.

Yet Ye Chong did not say what the reward would be. Instead, he stared thoughtfully at Liu Yan beside him, his emerald eyes flickering with a complex light.

Even though Liu Yan was only an Artifact Spirit, being stared at by him made her feel uneasy. She could not help but hide behind Yang Kai. The other party was a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert—even if he was at the end of his strength, who knew what he might still be capable of?

After a long while, Ye Chong seemed to make up his mind and said, "You may enter the cave where this Lord previously stayed. Perhaps you will find an opportunity there."

Yang Kai quickly said, "Senior, please give me clear instructions."

Ye Chong replied, "If the opportunity comes, you will know. If not, asking is useless!"

Yang Kai's face darkened. The other party's words were as good as saying nothing. Since he wanted to give him a benefit, why not be straightforward? Instead, he was being so secretive—it seemed rather petty.

Still, the other party was a senior from tens of thousands of years ago. Yang Kai could not be bothered to argue, nor was he interested in thanking him. For Yang Kai, this trip was only to help Chiyue Sect repair the Space Array. Speaking with Ye Chong was just a coincidence.

Yang Kai had never intended to keep his ring for himself anyway. Of course... if Ye Chong had not placed a bloodline restriction on the ring, he would have examined and copied it before returning it to Ye Hen.

He was quite interested in the Dao of Puppetry as well.

But now, with the bloodline restriction, Yang Kai naturally could not investigate what treasures were inside the ring. If he really tried, there might be some backlash. Ye Chong was a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert—who knew if he had left any dangerous traps in that bloodline restriction?

Just as Yang Kai was secretly complaining, Ye Chong suddenly asked, "How long has it been now?"

Yang Kai frowned and said, "I don't know the exact number of years, but it's been about tens of thousands of years."

"Tens of thousands of years..." Ye Chong was stunned. Then he gave a bitter smile. "What is the situation of Chiyue Sect now? Are there many experts in the sect?"

Yang Kai said, "If Senior is asking about Dao Origin Realm experts, there are indeed quite a few. As for the Emperor Realm, there is not a single one."

Ye Chong sighed, "It was this Lord who ruined the sect!"

His tone was filled with deep self-blame and regret. Back then, if he had not been so stubborn and insisted on bringing all the cultivation methods and secret arts into the secret realm, hoping to comprehend and refine himself into a puppet, to achieve the Dao with his own body, Chiyue Sect would not have ended up like this.

In the end, he failed.

The moment he failed, he knew he was wrong. He underestimated the authority of the Heavenly Dao, thinking he would surely succeed. He foresaw the decline of Chiyue Sect, so he did everything he could to leave a wisp of his soul in the Corpse Puppet, and tens of thousands of years later, he finally met Yang Kai.

Seeing him like this, Yang Kai could not say anything.

After sighing, Ye Chong suddenly lowered his head, which drooped onto his chest. The emerald light in his eyes gradually dimmed until it disappeared. Then, a wisp of black aura flew out from the top of the Corpse Puppet's head and dissipated into nothingness.

Yang Kai knew that the Sect Master of Chiyue Sect from tens of thousands of years ago had finally fallen completely, not even a trace of his soul remaining.

After losing the last remnant of his soul, the Corpse Puppet's body suddenly collapsed with a clatter, turning into a pile of white bones.

Yang Kai could not help but sigh.

No matter how powerful a martial artist is, there will come a day when they return to dust. Ye Chong tried to prove the Heavenly Dao with his own body, seeking an immortal body, but even with his extraordinary talent, he could not escape the constraints of the laws of heaven and earth.

Even Third Stage Emperor Realm experts are like this—how difficult is it to achieve true immortality? Who knows if the Great Emperors can do it?

This thought arose, and Yang Kai slowly shook his head. The Great Emperors surely could not reach such a level. If they could, people like the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor and the Great Emperor of Time would not have fallen.

He did have a bit of hope, but only if he could refine the Everlasting Tree. It was said that after refining the Everlasting Tree, one could achieve an immortal and indestructible body, though he did not know if it was true.

After sighing, Yang Kai's emotions surged. He and Liu Yan buried Ye Chong's bones on the spot.

He did not bury them too carefully, because once the teleportation array here was repaired, Ye Hen would surely come by. Such matters should be left to Ye Hen—after all, it was his ancestor, and he would hold a proper funeral.

After dealing with Ye Chong's remains, Yang Kai took Liu Yan and headed toward the cave where he had previously encountered Ye Chong.

Ye Chong said there was an opportunity in the cave, but Yang Kai was full of suspicion. When he entered the cave before, he had not had time to investigate carefully, but he had not found anything special.

Liu Yan was also puzzled. She followed behind Yang Kai and asked, "Master, when Senior Ye mentioned an opportunity earlier, why did he stare at me?"

"Because you're beautiful," Yang Kai replied casually.

"Nonsense!" Liu Yan glared at Yang Kai. Although she thought her human form was not ugly, how could Ye Chong stare at her for that reason? Back then, he was the Sect Master of a top sect—what kind of women had he not seen?

Yang Kai chuckled and said, "He must have seen your true form, so he looked at you a bit more. Nothing strange about that."

"I think that's the reason too," Liu Yan nodded in agreement.

As the two talked, they soon returned to the cave. Because Ye Chong had mentioned an opportunity, Yang Kai entered with his Divine Sense fully extended, searching carefully as he advanced.

But even after reaching the innermost part, he found nothing suspicious.

"Could it be a lie?" Yang Kai was a bit frustrated. Ye Chong had guarded against him like a thief, placing a bloodline restriction on the ring. That could be excused, but if the so-called opportunity was also a lie, that would be too much.

He had never expected to gain any benefit from Ye Chong in the first place. If the other party brought up a reward on his own initiative, only to deceive him in the end, then it was no longer a matter of character—it was simply shameless.

Unwilling to give up, Yang Kai searched the lowest level several more times. He even pierced the stone walls with his Divine Sense to explore inside, but still found nothing.

Instead, Liu Yan suddenly stared intently at an oval-shaped stone.

"What's unusual about it?" Yang Kai asked.

Liu Yan said, "Master, this stone doesn't seem like an ordinary stone."

Hearing this, Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and immediately swept his Divine Sense over the stone. He had checked it before but had not paid much attention, since the stone did not even have any Spiritual Qi fluctuations. Clearly, it was not some heaven-and-earth treasure.

But upon checking again, Yang Kai discovered something unusual.

This stone could actually devour his Divine Sense, causing a slight pain in his Sea of Consciousness.

"Huh..." Yang Kai muttered. "Could the opportunity Ye Chong mentioned be this stone?"

There was nothing else suspicious in the cave—only this oval stone was strange. If there really was an opportunity, it had to be this thing.

But what could a stone do? Was it a top-tier refining material? Yang Kai was puzzled. He did not need refining materials—he already had several Imperial Treasures and did not need to refine any more Secret Treasures.

Liu Yan was also confused. She reached out to touch the stone, wanting to see what was so strange about it.

"Don't!" Yang Kai hurriedly stopped her. Although he did not know what was strange about the stone, it was clearly unwise to touch it before figuring out its true nature. Moreover, it could even devour his Divine Sense.

But he was a bit too late.

Liu Yan had already touched the strange stone. Hearing Yang Kai's shout, she instinctively tried to pull her hand back. But at that moment, a powerful suction force erupted from the stone. The force was so strong that Liu Yan had no power to resist. She had time only to cry out before being sucked in, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Yang Kai's expression changed drastically. Although Liu Yan could take human form and looked like a living beauty, she did not have a physical body—she was not a living being. Her body was made entirely of pure energy, condensed to the point of resembling a real person.

What in the world was this bizarre stone, to actually swallow up Liu Yan like that? How could such a thing be allowed to happen?

Without any hesitation, Yang Kai activated his Origin Qi and struck the stone with his palm.

With a loud bang, a clear palm print appeared on the stone, but, strangely, it did not shatter. Instead, after Yang Kai withdrew his hand, it slowly recovered.

In less than ten breaths, the stone had returned to its original state, with no sign of having been attacked.

"Memory-Forging Flowing Gold?" Yang Kai's expression changed slightly, but he quickly realized something was wrong.

Although Memory-Forging Flowing Gold was a top-tier refining material, and any Secret Treasure with even a trace of it could self-repair no matter how badly damaged it was, what he knew of Memory-Forging Flowing Gold was definitely not like this.

He had wanted to shatter the stone to rescue Liu Yan, but after one strike, he knew it was impossible. The stone was not hard, but extremely tough—it simply could not be broken.

After Liu Yan was sucked into the stone, Yang Kai felt that the mysterious connection he had always shared with her was suddenly severed.

Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit. When Yang Kai refined her original body, the Refining Furnace, there had always been an invisible connection between them. For so many years, it had never been broken, but now it was completely gone.

Yang Kai's face turned pale, thinking Liu Yan had perished.

That was the only way to explain why their connection had been severed.

Yang Kai was instantly heartbroken, his mood sinking to the lowest depths.
