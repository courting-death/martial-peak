## Chapter 2546 — It's Him

"Sir, that Hua Feichen is an Elder of the Netherworld Sect. His cultivation reached the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm over a hundred years ago, and he's a renowned expert. Plus, Yin Lesheng has also advanced to the Emperor Realm. Sir, you'd best avoid crossing them." Qi Hefeng, seeing Yang Kai itching for action, was startled. He'd never met someone so reckless before—Yang Kai had only just become an Emperor, yet acted as if he was invincible, not even putting Hua Feichen in his eyes. Qi Hefeng hurriedly suggested, "Sir, perhaps you should withdraw for now and reconsider your approach."

"Yin Lesheng has become an Emperor too?" Yang Kai frowned. "When did that happen?"

Qi Hefeng replied, "I'm not sure exactly when, but after he returned from the Shattered Star Sea, he was already an Emperor."

Yang Kai mused, "Looks like that guy had quite the opportunity."

He remembered that back in the Shattered Star Sea, when he spared Yin Lesheng, the man was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Yang Kai himself had advanced to Emperor because he witnessed a battle between two Great Emperors, and the clash of the Imperial Auras gave him many insights. He had no idea what kind of fortune Yin Lesheng encountered afterward.

Still, the Shattered Star Sea was full of opportunities, and Yin Lesheng was quite talented. It wasn't surprising he managed to become an Emperor.

After thinking it over, Yang Kai bent down, grabbed the chin of the man with the bitter melon face, making him meet his gaze. Golden light swirled in Yang Kai's right eye as he quietly unleashed his Divine Soul power, pressing down on the man's consciousness. "Are you really from the Netherworld Sect?" he asked.

The bitter melon face was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, so he couldn't withstand Yang Kai's Divine Soul suppression. He hesitated for just a moment before answering honestly, "That's right."

"Did your Netherworld Sect come to the Ancient Land passage just to deal with me?"

"Yes."

"How many came? Besides Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng, are there any other Emperors?"

"Twenty-five came. Other than Elder Hua and Senior Brother Yin, there are no other Emperors."

Yang Kai snorted coldly. "Just this many people think they can take me down? Yin Lesheng must be out of his mind. What tricks does he have up his sleeve?"

Bitter melon face replied, "The Senior Brothers will set up the Heaven Net Sealing Array. Then Elder Hua and Senior Brother Yin will personally strike to kill you."

"Heaven Net Sealing Array?"

Qi Hefeng suddenly exclaimed in shock.

Yang Kai turned to look at him. "What kind of array is that?"

Qi Hefeng answered with a strange expression, "It's an extremely powerful grand array of the Netherworld Sect. Once deployed, the array becomes like a ghostly domain. Trapped inside, your chances of survival keep slipping away, and the area covered by the array is completely cut off from heaven and earth—no way in or out."

After explaining, Qi Hefeng frowned. "To actually set up the Heaven Net Sealing Array... that's quite the move."

In Qi Hefeng's view, having Hua Feichen personally take action was already giving Yang Kai enough face. After all, one was at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, the other at the First, and with Yin Lesheng assisting, no matter how strong Yang Kai was, there was no way he could escape—he'd lose his head sooner or later.

The two working together were enough to take down Yang Kai, so why bother with the Heaven Net Sealing Array? Setting up this array required Netherworld Sect disciples to refine the Netherworld Infernal Banner with their own Essence-Blood. If the array was broken, all those Secret Treasures would be destroyed, and the disciples would suffer backlash, tormented by ten thousand ghosts, wishing for death.

The grand protective array covering the Netherworld Sect's mountain gate was a massive Heaven Net Sealing Array, with three Imperial Treasure-grade Netherworld Infernal Banners as the Formation Core. If an enemy invaded, once the array was activated, there was no way out.

Still, even an array set up by over twenty Netherworld Sect disciples was not to be underestimated.

Was Yang Kai really that formidable, to warrant such caution from the Netherworld Sect? Qi Hefeng couldn't figure it out no matter how he thought about it.

What he didn't know was that Yin Lesheng understood Yang Kai's mastery of space powers, so he brought people to set up the array. Hua Feichen's strength was indeed higher than Yang Kai's, but killing him wouldn't be easy.

Since ancient times, martial artists skilled in space powers were always hard to kill. To cut off their escape, you had to first seal the space so they couldn't use their powers to flee.

"Cut off from heaven and earth... hmph." Yang Kai snorted, now understanding what the Heaven Net Sealing Array was for.

"Sir, you can't enter the Ancient Land now. It's best to withdraw. If you need to find something in the Ancient Land, my Qi Family Stronghold can help. You just need to wait at the fortress for news." Qi Hefeng looked at Yang Kai earnestly.

He felt that with Yang Kai's current strength, if he walked into the trap, he'd surely die.

"What I'm looking for, your Qi Family Stronghold can't help with." Yang Kai shook his head.

He'd come to the Ancient Land not to seek treasure, but to find traces of Xiaoxiao. That was something the Qi Family Stronghold couldn't help with.

As he spoke, he flicked his hand, and the bitter melon-faced man collapsed limply to the ground. There were no visible injuries, but inside, his body was reduced to dust—dead beyond saving.

"Let's go," Yang Kai called to Zhang Ruoxi and Old Ban. He'd learned all he needed, so there was no point in probing further. As he spoke, he wrapped the two in Emperor Yuan, and with a flash, they vanished like ghosts.

"Sir! Sir!" Qi Hefeng called out twice in a hurry, but Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen. After rushing out, he was immediately shrouded in strange mist, unable to see his own hand, and even his Divine Sense couldn't be released.

Qi Hefeng stood there dazed for a while, then stomped his foot in frustration and hurried out.

It was impossible to find Yang Kai in the Ancient Land passage. He'd only managed to meet him by waiting in that cave. Now that Yang Kai was gone, all he could do was rush back to the Qi Family Stronghold as fast as possible and let the Young Stronghold Master decide what to do next.

...

A hundred li away from where Yang Kai and the others had been, in another cave.

A group of martial artists with sinister expressions, their bodies exuding ghostly energy and icy auras, gathered together. This cave was much larger than the one Yang Kai and the others had hidden in, easily accommodating over twenty people without feeling crowded.

Most of these twenty-plus people wore identical clothing, clearly from the same Sect.

Leading them was a powerful expert at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, dressed in splendid robes, about fifty years old, with a ruddy complexion and a broad forehead.

This was Hua Feichen, an Elder of the Netherworld Sect.

Beside Hua Feichen, Yin Lesheng's snake-like eyes stared at the swirling strange mist outside, a cold smile on his lips, making people uncomfortable.

Whenever he recalled his encounter with Yang Kai in the Shattered Star Sea, Yin Lesheng found himself restless, unable to sleep or eat in peace.

Since he began cultivating, he'd never suffered such a loss. He'd always crushed others with absolute strength, never expecting that one day someone of the same level would surpass him.

He simply couldn't accept it.

What stung most was that last time, to save his life, he'd had to swallow his pride and say some soft words. If he hadn't had information Yang Kai wanted, he would've been killed then and there. In the end, it was the Soul Contract that saved him.

Back in the Starlight Passage, Yang Kai was no match for him at all. Yet in less than ten years, Yang Kai had grown so much.

If he was given a few more years, wouldn't he be able to trample him at will?

Since he'd made an enemy, he had to eliminate the threat. If Yang Kai was allowed to grow, his own days would be miserable.

So after returning to the Sect, he asked his Master to send Elder Hua Feichen, along with over twenty disciples, to the Ancient Land passage to make sure Yang Kai was killed here.

With Hua Feichen, the Heaven Net Sealing Array, and his own trump cards, Yang Kai was as good as dead this time.

Yin Lesheng really wanted to see Yang Kai battered and begging for mercy. That scene would be beautiful...

"Elder, something's wrong!" a sudden cry interrupted Yin Lesheng's daydream, making him very unhappy. He turned to see a Netherworld Sect disciple standing beside Hua Feichen, looking grim.

"What is it?" Yin Lesheng asked with a frown.

Hua Feichen also opened his eyes, looking at him calmly.

The disciple stammered, "Senior Brother Yao... is dead."

"Who killed him?" Yin Lesheng asked through gritted teeth. The Ancient Land passage was chaotic and dangerous, but Netherworld Sect disciples were a force in the Eastern Territory—who would dare slaughter them lightly?

"It seems... it was that man," the disciple replied. As he spoke, he wiped his palm across a bead, and suddenly a phantom appeared in midair, revealing the scene of Yang Kai reaching out and shattering the bitter melon-faced man's organs with a single strike.

No one knew what kind of secret technique this was, but it could transmit the last thing the bitter melon face saw before dying, letting Hua Feichen and the others see it clearly.

"Yang Kai," Yin Lesheng growled, eyes red as he stared at the image of his enemy.

"That's him! That's the bastard who bullied me! He really did enter the Ancient Land passage! Hua Feichen, you have to catch him for me. I want to torture him well!" On the other side of the cave, a red-clothed young woman suddenly jumped up, her eyes blazing as she glared at Yang Kai's image.

This girl was the same one who'd troubled Old Ban before. No one knew how she'd ended up with the Netherworld Sect, but Elder Fu had followed her here, while the other two Third Stage Dao Origin Realm guards were nowhere to be seen—dead or alive.

The girl was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but she ordered the Emperor Realm expert Hua Feichen around, calling him by name without a hint of respect.

Hua Feichen, on the other hand, wasn't angry at all—just a bit helpless.

Yin Lesheng turned to the red-clothed girl, smiling, "Miss Lin, are you saying... the one you want to teach a lesson is him?"

"That's right!" Lin's eyes blazed as she bit her silver teeth. "It's him! I'd recognize him even if he turned to ash! Hurry up and catch him for me—I want him kneeling and begging for mercy!"
