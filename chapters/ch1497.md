## Chapter 1497 — The Next One Is You

Outside the palace, nearly thirty Origin Returning Realm experts of the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect eyed him like tigers watching their prey, hemming in every side around Yang Kai until not even water could pass. The helmsmen of the two great powers had personally led the teams, and experts came forth in an endless stream.

Though they had yet to strike, a multitude of differing auras already blanketed a radius of several hundred zhang, the defenses tight to the extreme. Within that range of several hundred zhang, it would be no exaggeration to call it impossible to move even half a step.

"Yang Kai, for the sake of you being the master of a sect, if you are willing to surrender and cripple your own cultivation, this Young Master might not be unable to plead on your behalf, to have my father and the Sect Master spare your life!" Qu Changfeng lightly shook his folding fan as he spoke in a cold, low voice.

"Spare my life?" Yang Kai chuckled darkly, not the least bit flustered. "What? Young Master Qu thinks there is no way I can spread my wings this time? You think I am doomed to die? Are you so confident you can keep me here?"

"It is not confidence," Qu Changfeng slowly shook his head, "it is fact. As things stand, you still want to leave this place safely? Open your eyes wide and see how many people are here."

"And numbers mean anything?" Yang Kai curled his lip.

"Heh, you merely rely on understanding a bit of Spatial Force. So what? You are not the only one here who grasps that power," Qu Changfeng sneered with a half-smile. "If you intend to flee using Spatial Force, this Young Master advises you to snuff out that idea, lest you suffer a bitter loss."

Yang Kai's face sank slightly. He glanced over the crowd, and his gaze fixed upon Mo Xiaosheng.

He had heard more than once that this Great Elder of the Battle Sky Alliance had cultivated Spatial Force. Though he had never witnessed him act, there is no smoke without fire; eight or nine times out of ten it was no false rumor. And now that old fellow was staring at him with a wary face, Saint Yuan hidden yet ready, obviously on guard against him using Spatial Force to escape.

"What? Did this Young Master hit upon your secret?" Seeing his displeasure, Qu Changfeng laughed loudly, assuming he had jabbed Yang Kai's soft spot.

Yang Kai ignored him and instead turned his gaze to Qu Zheng and Fang Peng. He took a light breath and narrowed his eyes as he asked, "Do you two truly mean to do this?"

"At this point, what more is there to say? Cripple your cultivation and we will not take your life!" Qu Zheng said blandly, his tone brooking no dispute.

The order from Star Emperor Mountain was to capture Yang Kai alive to use as leverage, to coerce Lingxiao Sect to surrender that Void King-Grade warship. So from the very beginning, Qu Zheng and the others had never intended to kill Yang Kai; mobilizing so many people was solely to take him alive.

“Very well.” Yang Kai’s lips curved into a smile. “I never sought open conflict with the forces behind you two — but since you insist on forcing my hand, then let's see if you can endure my wrath!”

"Such shameless boasting!" Qu Changfeng barked sharply. "I give you ten breaths of time to consider. After ten breaths, this Young Master will personally take you down!"

"No need to consider." Yang Kai slowly shook his head, a trace of mockery at the corner of his mouth. "Young Master Qu, do not take yourself so seriously—because you are nothing."

"Impudence!" Qu Changfeng had never suffered such humiliation. His debonair bearing was replaced by ferocity; like a viper whose tail had been trodden, he flicked his poisonous tongue, teeth clenched as he shouted.

"I will start with you, then. From the first time I saw you, I found you an eyesore. Had you not provoked me, I could not be bothered to deal with you. But since you are hell-bent on courting death, I will oblige!" Yang Kai's expression hardened, his gaze stabbing toward him like blades.

The entire audience was dumbstruck!

They had seen the bold, but never anyone this bold.

With nearly thirty Origin Returning Realm gathered here, this youth named Yang Kai not only showed not the slightest retreat or timidity, he even threatened Qu Changfeng to his face before everyone, declaring he would take his life. Had this fellow taken leave of his senses?

Had he not seen clearly what the situation before him was?

Even the ever-steady Qu Zheng and Fang Peng wore utterly baffled expressions, secretly wondering if Yang Kai had been frightened past his limits and lost his mind.

Yet the next instant, the two of them went wooden, because golden light blossomed within Yang Kai's left eye. In that golden radiance, a lotus bud quietly appeared and, with a slight sway, vanished from sight.

Strong as Qu Zheng and Fang Peng were, under the influence of that golden light their minds, too, wavered for a heartbeat.

When they came back to themselves, cold sweat had already broken out along their backs. And just then, a miserable scream entered their ears. Following the sound, they saw the formerly overbearing Qu Changfeng clutching his head and howling, as though enduring an agony beyond endurance, scarlet blood quickly seeping from his ears, nose, and mouth.

"Changfeng!" Qu Zheng's face changed dramatically. He shouted in alarm, his figure flickering as he prepared to rush toward his son.

But before he could act, a dull thud sounded from that direction.

A gorgeous blood-red flower bloomed—Qu Changfeng's entire head burst apart. From the severed neck, blood shot up like a fountain to a height of one zhang, then splattered down in a rain that dyed the earth bright red.

"Impossible!" Fang Peng cried out, aghast, his face drained of color.

The other Origin Returning Realm experts were likewise stupefied, terror-stricken beyond words.

Yang Kai had shown no sign of making a move, yet Qu Changfeng had died so inexplicably—and in such a wretched fashion.

Divine Sense power! To kill without lifting a hand, only Divine Sense power could explain it. In that instant just now, any expert who met Yang Kai's gaze felt a brief trance, losing their minds within that golden light.

They vaguely beheld the bud of a lotus flower.

Just how strong was his Divine Sense? To slay a martial artist of the same realm in an instant—such Divine Sense cultivation, such an uncanny secret art—were things even Qu Zheng and Fang Peng did not possess.

If that secret art had been cast upon them just now... At that thought, many felt a chill crawl up their backs and their hearts drum in panic.

"Father!" Fang Tianzhong had also turned pale. He gritted his teeth and called to Fang Peng in a low shout.

He and Qu Changfeng were both long-renowned figures, acclaimed as paragons of the younger generation on Dark Star. Although Qu Changfeng's usual conduct was dissipated and vile, the man had real ability. Fang Tianzhong had contended with him for many years, neither gaining the upper hand. He had followed along this time, just as Qu Changfeng had said earlier, to see whether he or Yang Kai was stronger.

Who would have thought he would witness the scene just now.

If he could kill Qu Changfeng in an instant, then dealing with him would likely not take much effort either!

There was no longer any need to verify who was stronger. With strength like that, even two of himself together would not measure up. Shocked as he was, Fang Tianzhong was also filled with unwillingness.

He had a distinguished background and outstanding aptitude, had enjoyed the finest cultivation resources and environment since childhood, and at a young age had already made a grand name. Among the younger generation, save for a select few, he regarded no one else in his eyes.

He had every reason to be proud.

He could not fathom what kind of fortune Yang Kai had encountered to possess such terrifying battle power.

The scene of Qu Changfeng's tragic death had already shredded his pride to dust, leaving an indelible shadow upon his heart.

"Tianzhong, get farther away. This is not something you can interfere in!" Fang Peng's brows were deeply furrowed as he instructed in a low voice.

With Qu Changfeng as the cautionary example, he naturally did not wish for his own son to die inexplicably as well.

"Yes!" Fang Tianzhong answered through clenched teeth, his figure blurring as he withdrew a hundred zhang away.

"Brother Qu!" Fang Peng called out to Qu Zheng again.

Qu Zheng was completely stunned.

He still seemed unable to recover from the scene of his son's miserable death, standing there in a daze, his face full of incredulity.

"Not bad, not bad—none of you ran." Yang Kai smiled faintly. The golden light in his left eye had already withdrawn, and his face bore a nonchalant expression, as though killing Qu Changfeng had been no more than lifting a hand. "Worthy indeed of being experts from two supreme forces—your mental cultivation is truly uncommon. Do not rush. We will go one by one. None of you will get away."

Saying so, he casually pointed at someone to his left, a cruel, cold smile surfacing on his face. "The next one is you!"

"Me?" The one Yang Kai pointed to was a middle-aged woman. Her looks were passable, but her figure was most alluring. Clad in a watery-blue long dress, she exuded the charm of a mature beauty in her prime.

Her strength was not low either—the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Being singled out by Yang Kai, the woman's delicate body could not help but tremble, as if she had just been sentenced to death. Her pretty face turned unsightly as she looked toward Qu Zheng in panic, seemingly seeking protection.

But Qu Zheng remained standing there in a daze—how would he spare her a glance? With no one to rely on, the woman clenched her teeth and shouted shrilly, "If you want my life, let's see whether you have that ability!"

Yang Kai’s killing of Qu Changfeng had carried a hint of ambush to it. Moreover, this middle-aged woman considered her strength superior to Qu Changfeng’s, so even knowing how formidable Yang Kai was, she had no intention of waiting meekly for death.

As she spoke, Saint Yuan surged out to envelop her body. A rich water attribute aura billowed forth, and that Saint Yuan turned into a thin membrane visible to the naked eye, protecting her on all sides. From afar, the woman looked as though she stood within a bubble.

Nor was she finished. She hurriedly summoned a secret treasure like a gauzy veil; once infused with Saint Yuan, it instantly transformed into a sheet of blue radiance that blocked the front.

"Useless toil!" Yang Kai sneered, and a delicate little arrow only a palm in length suddenly appeared in his palm.

Feather Spirit Arrow!

A bizarre secret treasure that Yang Kai had just obtained.

He did not know how much power it could unleash, but it should not be low. This was just the moment to give it a try.

Facing the middle-aged woman, Yang Kai gave the Feather Spirit Arrow a casual forward swipe. His movements were careless.

Yet an earth-shaking fluctuation of energy surged out from the Feather Spirit Arrow. On the gem inlaid at the arrowhead, intricate runes the size of rice grains surfaced and flowed without cease. As those runes welled up, the phantom of a little arrow suddenly shot forth from the Feather Spirit Arrow, streaking straight toward the woman.

That little arrow phantom was pitch-black, its whole body faintly wreathed in flames.

The Feather Spirit Arrow was charged by Yang Kai's own Saint Yuan, so when it manifested its might, it naturally displayed the properties of Demonic Flame.

Scorching to the extreme, it even baked the very space until it warped.
