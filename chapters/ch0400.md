## Chapter 400 — Brothers Meet

Yang Kai was not overly concerned about the Bamboo Segment Gang. He only needed them to gather intelligence and pass on messages.

That group of people, to put it bluntly, was nothing more than a rabble; any decent expert could easily wipe them out. If it weren’t for the fact that he currently had no power to mobilize, he wouldn’t even trouble himself with them.

Pang Chi accepted the hefty sum without hesitation, evidently making a declaration of loyalty, which Yang Kai understood very well.

After exiting the Bamboo Segment Gang’s headquarters, he hurried back.

Just halfway, a voice suddenly called out to him.

Turning towards the sound, he saw Yang Zhao smiling and waving from the second floor of a nearby tavern. “Younger Brother Kai, come up and chat.”

Yang Kai frowned slightly, not expecting to encounter him here, but he didn’t refuse. He dismounted from the Treading Cloud Steed and walked directly into the tavern.

Upon reaching the second floor and entering the private room where Yang Zhao was, he immediately felt several sharp gazes directed at him.

“Second Brother.” Yang Kai greeted by clasping his hands, subtly surveying the surroundings, his heart stirring slightly.

Although he didn’t recognize most of the people present, from their attire and demeanor, he could ascertain that they were not ordinary individuals.

“Come, come.” Yang Zhao warmly pulled Yang Kai in, pointing to a young man sitting in a chair, stroking his chin with a smile as he looked their way. “Do you know who this is?”

Yang Kai glanced over and smiled slightly. “Fifth Brother!”

Yang Jia’s young generation ranked fifth, Yang Kang, was a direct brother to Yang Zhao, so Yang Kai naturally recognized him. He just didn’t expect him to have returned to Zhongdu as well.

Yang Kang appraised Yang Kai for a moment before saying nothing—only giving a slight nod, his expression neutral, with a faint smile on his face.

When brothers meet, it should not be so bland, yet Yang Kang said nothing. The disdain was already evident.

The others present observed Yang Kai, seemingly hoping to uncover some embarrassment or awkwardness on his face. However, when they saw his expression remain unchanged, they couldn’t help but feel disappointed.

Yang Zhao seemed oblivious to the undercurrents and continued to enthusiastically introduce the people seated.

Indeed, they were all prominent figures, all scions of the Eight Great Families.

Kang Zhan from the Kang Family, Gao Rangfeng from the Gao Family, and Ye Xinrou from the Ye Family. These two young men and one young woman—each were leading figures of their respective families' younger generation. Their gathering with the Yang Family's direct line here clearly indicated their intention to participate in the contention for the family leadership.

However, whom they would ultimately choose remained uncertain.

After the introductions, everyone took their seats. Yang Kang suddenly smiled gently and looked at Yang Kai. “Younger Brother Kai, I heard you only stayed at the Transformation Dragon Pool for half a day before you came out?”

Yang Kai nodded. “Yes, my aptitude is too poor; I gained nothing beneficial inside.”

Yang Kang chuckled lightly and bluntly said, “For you, that’s already quite good.”

“Fifth!” Yang Zhao lightly reprimanded him, glaring briefly before patting Yang Kai's shoulder and comforting him. “Your Fifth Brother is just straightforward and doesn’t know how to hold his tongue. Don’t mind him. The Transformation Dragon Pool isn’t as miraculous as the rumors say. At least I stayed in there for four days and gained little benefit.”

“You’re impressive, Second Brother!” Yang Kang exclaimed with wide eyes. “I could only last three days before I couldn’t bear it anymore.”

“I heard that your Yang Family’s Transformation Dragon Pool is a place to test a person’s aptitude?" Ye Xinrou asked with a smile.

Kang Zhan and Gao Rangfeng shared her interest. Kang Zhan chimed in, “I also heard that the longer you stay inside, the better your aptitude is.”

Yang Zhao cast a somewhat awkward glance at Yang Kai, then nodded slightly. “That’s what they say, but the actual situation is unknown. How can a person’s aptitude be simply judged by the Transformation Dragon Pool?”

“But it’s certain that the shorter the stay, the worse the aptitude,” Yang Kang said with a smile, looking at Yang Kai. “Younger Brother Kai, you really don’t need to care too much. Back in the day, it seemed you couldn’t even cultivate martial arts. I heard you’ve entered the True Essence Realm now, which is a great fortune already. One should be content to find joy in life.”

“And one must know their limits. Isn’t that right, Fifth Brother?” Yang Kai replied coolly. He perceived Yang Kang’s jabs directed at him and felt no close kinship with his few cousins. While there wasn’t much malice, Yang Kang’s words were laced with veiled barbs, which displeased him.

When words do not resonate, it’s better to refrain from engaging further.

Seemingly taken aback by Yang Kai daring to speak like that, Yang Kang was momentarily stunned, as were the three young scions from the other families, who hadn’t expected this youngest master to be so assertive.

Yang Zhao's gaze flickered slightly before he burst into hearty laughter. “Let’s not discuss this; the Transformation Dragon Pool is just a water pool after all; the future of my Yang Family's scions is not something it can determine.”

“True,” Kang Zhan nodded slightly, shaking his head with a bitter smile. “Your Yang Family scions are all fierce wolves and tigers; in the past, Zhongdu belonged to our seven families, but now that your Yang Family has returned, we have to stand aside.”

“Brother Kang is being too modest. Zhongdu is so vast; my Yang Family alone cannot occupy all of it. The future here belongs to our entire generation.”

Gao Rangfeng frowned and asked, “How many scions from your Yang Family have returned now?”

“Four.” Yang Zhao's expression dimmed slightly. “Aside from the three of us, there’s also Fourth Brother Yang Xinwu who has returned, but he was severely injured on the way back and nearly lost his life. The elders in the clan are currently treating him, and it’s uncertain how he is…”

Yang Kai's expression turned cold, and Yang Kang’s face also became exceptionally grim.

Both had encountered an expert ambush during their return, but fortunately, they had been lucky to escape unscathed. It was Fourth Brother Yang Xinwu who had not been so fortunate.

“A big tree attracts the wind,” Yang Zhao said with a bitter laugh, his expression firming again. “But the family has dispatched more experts to welcome the rest. I believe those coming later won’t encounter any problems. There’s news that eldest brother Yang Wei will be returning soon as well.”

“Eldest brother is coming back?” Yang Kang asked in shock.

Yang Zhao looked at him with a smile. “He’ll be back in no more than two or three days, or possibly five or six.”

Yang Kang’s expression immediately soured, seemingly fearful of Yang Wei.

“Zhongdu will soon be lively,” Ye Xinrou smiled, her bright eyes sparkling. “Liu Qingshao from the Liu Family won’t be lonely anymore, hehe.”

Speaking of Liu Qingshao’s name, everyone present couldn’t help but stiffen, even Yang Zhao became very serious.

Liu Qingshao of the Liu Family had previously been the number one scion in Zhongdu. It was rumored that he had cultivated to the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm at a young age. Such aptitude was incredibly rare, appearing once in a hundred years. His influence in Zhongdu was unrivaled. In the contention for the family leadership, whoever could win him over would gain a colossal ally.

“I truly hope the contention for the family leadership begins soon, so that I can witness the prowess of the Yang Family scions!” Kang Zhan said with a slight smile, showing eagerness.

“Fratricide, hehe…” Yang Zhao chuckled bitterly. “That would be a spectacle for the world to see.”

Gao Rangfeng added, “I hope that if one day I stand against everyone present, you all can show mercy!”

“Back at you!”

After conversing for a while, Yang Kai finally stood up to take his leave.

Watching his departing figure, the scions from the Kang, Gao, and Ye Families fell into a slight daze, while Yang Zhao and Yang Kang said nothing to them and didn’t appear to have any intention of courting their favor. Still, all three knew that sitting here meant they were interested in something.

There was a hint of goodwill in their words.

However, this Yang Kai was intriguing; he didn’t express anything at all. In the contention for the family leadership, where would he find his support?

Was this arrogance or confidence? Or did he realize there was no hope at all?

The three frowned slightly, deep in thought.

Noticing the expressions of the three, Yang Kang snorted lightly. “Second Brother, I’m not targeting Younger Brother Kai; it’s just that I think a person like him shouldn’t participate in the contention for the family leadership to avoid embarrassing himself.”

Yang Zhao chuckled lightly. “Fifth, don’t underestimate Younger Brother Kai. He has means.”

“Means? I see none!” 

Yang Zhao's expression became serious as he asked softly, “Let me ask you, how did the two Blood Servants who accompanied you back treat you on the way?”

Yang Kang grew impatient. “Don’t mention them. Just talking about them frustrates me. Those two were like wooden mannequins; they didn’t respond to any questions as if they were the masters.”

Yang Zhao smiled. “While my two aren’t like that, they’re similar. But the two Blood Servants who came to greet Younger Brother Kai treated him with deep respect and courtesy. Don’t you think that’s strange?”

“Impossible! Blood Servants are all proud; how could they respect him? Second Brother, you must have seen it wrong!” 

Yang Kang didn’t believe it at all, shaking his head as he spoke.

“That’s why I say Younger Brother Kai has means,” Yang Zhao said, his tone grave.

Yang Kang’s expression turned astonished, his brows tightly furrowed. He seemed to be contemplating something, finally murmuring, “Second Brother, you’re overrating him. With such poor aptitude, he’s destined to accomplish little.”

As the two brothers spoke, the other three listened with slight smiles, showing no inclination to interject. They felt that Yang Kai's performance today was too bland, even somewhat uncharacteristic of a Yang Family scion about to participate in the contention for the family leadership.

This discovery left them puzzled and suspicious, wondering what kind of performance this youngest master would have in the contention for the family leadership.

In the Fourth Master Yang’s residence.

When Yang Kai returned, it was already dark. As he stepped through the door, the steward of the residence rushed over with a panicked face, tears in his eyes. “Young Master, you’ve finally returned.”

Yang Kai’s face tightened, questioning urgently, “What happened?”

“Something has happened to the Master and Madam.” The steward spoke as he hurriedly pulled Yang Kai inside. “You must go take a look!”

“What’s happened?” Yang Kai’s expression grew colder, and he expanded his Divine Sense to silently envelop the entire residence, quickly locating Fourth Master Yang and Dong Suzhu’s whereabouts.
