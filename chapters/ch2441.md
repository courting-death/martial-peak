## Chapter 2441 — Innocent and Untainted

Yu Ying gently bit her red lips and pitifully said, “Why do you two Senior Brothers always mock me the moment we meet? What have I done to offend you? There’s nothing between me and Senior Brother Feng, we’re completely innocent. Please don’t ruin my reputation.”

As she spoke, she glanced worriedly at Yang Kai, as if afraid he might learn about her past.

“Innocent and untainted?” Chang Xian’s eyes bulged in disbelief, and the other four from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land all wore expressions as if they’d seen a ghost.

After a moment, the five of them suddenly burst into loud, arrogant laughter, their voices full of ridicule.

Suddenly, the laughter stopped. Chang Hao’s face turned cold as he said, “That’s the funniest joke I’ve ever heard.”

Chang Xian added, “A man who could spend the night alone with Yu Ying and remain innocent probably hasn’t been born yet.”

Yu Ying’s face flushed crimson from their words. Even though she was naturally promiscuous, being spoken to like this in public still made her feel embarrassed. She glanced at Yang Kai and tried to defend herself, “Senior Brother Feng, don’t listen to their nonsense. I’m not that kind of person.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I know.”

He sneered inwardly. He’d already figured out this woman’s true nature over the past days, and now she was putting on an innocent act to explain herself. Who knew what she was really thinking?

Seeing Yang Kai’s indifferent response, Yu Ying felt frustrated and secretly blamed the Brahma Heaven Sacred Land group for meddling too much. But with her strength inferior, she didn’t dare get angry and could only look pitifully at them, “Did you come here just to humiliate me, Senior Brothers? If so, you’ve succeeded. I’ll take my leave.”

“Leave? Did you ask me first?” Chang Hao shouted.

“What do you want?” Yu Ying’s heart raced. Chang Hao’s group clearly didn’t come for a friendly chat.

Chang Xian glared coldly at Yu Ying and snorted, “Wretch, tell me, where is my Junior Brother Deng Yong now?”

Yu Ying’s expression changed slightly, but she quickly hid it and forced a smile, “Senior Brother Chang Xian, that’s a strange question. Don’t you know where Deng Yong is? Why ask me? I haven’t seen him.”

“Still lying!” Chang Hao’s eyes grew cold as he shouted, “Junior Brother Deng Yong was clearly killed by you.”

Yu Ying replied in panic, “Why would you think that, Senior Brother Chang Hao? I’ve never had any grudge with Deng Yong, and even if we met, I wouldn’t kill him. Besides, he’s stronger than me. Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t. Please don’t slander me.”

“Still trying to deny it?” Chang Hao gritted his teeth, eyes blazing as he glared at Yu Ying. With a cold snort, he said, “Since you refuse to admit your guilt, let me make it clear for you! Junior Brother Deng Yong’s Soul-Scattering Mark is branded right on your body. We tracked you here by sensing that very mark—what more do you have to say for yourself now?”

Yu Ying’s face turned deathly pale.

Chang Xian said, “We were wondering who killed Deng Yong, but it turns out it was you, wretch. Deng Yong was stronger than you, but it’s no surprise he died at your hands—he was obsessed with women!”

Chang Hao continued, “Though Deng Yong was blinded by lust and deserved to die, he was still a Sacred Land disciple. Yu Ying, you killed him, so you must pay with your life. Kill yourself!”

The two of them sentenced Yu Ying to death with every word, leaving her face bloodless and her body trembling.

At that moment, Yang Kai sensed a hidden Soul Brand somewhere on her body, likely left by Deng Yong before his death. Ironically, Yu Ying had never noticed it, which let the Brahma Heaven Sacred Land group catch her red-handed. Now, she couldn’t argue her way out.

He’d wondered why the five from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land had blocked his and Yu Ying’s path so directly. Now it was clear—the Soul-Scattering Mark had led them here.

He didn’t know when Yu Ying had killed Deng Yong, but it must have happened within the past year.

Yang Kai was secretly annoyed. He’d only stayed with Yu Ying to have her lead him to Yin Lesheng, but now this mess had cropped up. He couldn’t just ignore it—if he did, Yu Ying would surely die, and all his patience and effort would be wasted.

So, whether he liked it or not, he had to save Yu Ying.

“Still not doing it?” Chang Hao saw Yu Ying hesitate to kill herself and couldn’t help but shout, “Think carefully—if we do it, you won’t even get the chance to die!”

Yu Ying’s face grew even paler. She gritted her teeth, stepped back, and cried, “This is Senior Brother Feng De of my sect. If you have anything to say, say it to him!”

Seeing things go badly, the woman immediately pushed Yang Kai forward, clearly intending to use him as a shield, without any attempt to hide it.

“Feng De?” Chang Hao narrowed his eyes and glanced at Yang Kai, saying coldly, “Where did this trash come from? Never heard of him!”

In the entire Netherworld Sect, all Dao Origin Realm experts who could rival the two Holy Sons were well-known. This Feng De was unfamiliar, which meant he was just an ordinary disciple—no match for the two Holy Sons.

“Kid, you want to stand up for that wretch? Think carefully!” Chang Xian sneered at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s face darkened, his frustration boiling over. He snapped, “Since Junior Sister Yu calls me Senior Brother, I can’t just stand by. If you want to kill her, you’ll have to get past me first!”

Hiding behind him, Yu Ying’s beautiful eyes suddenly lit up. She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so courageous and responsible. After all, he wasn’t a Netherworld Sect disciple and had only met her by chance. Even if he ran away now, no one would blame him, but he didn’t do that.

This guy really is a fool! Yu Ying thought to herself.

Still, if Feng De could stall them for a while, she might be able to escape. As for whether Feng De lived or died, she didn’t care—her own life was what mattered.

It was a pity, though. She’d hoped to bring him into Netherworld Sect, but it seemed he didn’t have that luck.

Yu Ying was making plans in her heart while already preparing to run at any moment. Her stance was subtle, but Yang Kai easily saw through it.

He sneered inwardly. This woman was truly cunning and ruthless—if he really were Feng De, she’d have sold him out without a second thought. But while she was scheming, he had plans of his own.

“Fine, since you want to die, I’ll oblige!” Chang Hao, rough-looking and hot-tempered, was clearly enraged by Yang Kai. As he spoke, he flipped his hand, and a massive hammer appeared in his palm. Energy surged from the hammer, radiating a fierce aura. He raised it high and smashed it toward Yang Kai and Yu Ying.

Instantly, the surrounding space froze, as if the void itself was collapsing. A huge hammer shadow appeared, covering a vast area and enveloping both Yang Kai and Yu Ying.

The move was powerful, but Yang Kai didn’t take it seriously. If he wanted to, he could kill all five from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land in an instant.

But he didn’t want to reveal his heaven-defying strength, especially in front of Yu Ying.

So he pretended to be shocked, didn’t use any secret techniques or summon his Secret Treasure, and simply swung his fists, filling the air with countless fist shadows to meet the hammer’s attack.

Boom boom boom…

The void shook as energies clashed.

Yang Kai spat blood and staggered back ten zhang, looking exhausted.

Using his backward momentum, Yang Kai leapt into the void and fled without looking back, shouting as he left, “Junior Sister Yu, run!”

By then, Yu Ying had already used a secret technique, turning herself into a wisp of green smoke and fleeing like the wind. She’d started running the moment Yang Kai and Chang Hao clashed, never intending to help Yang Kai.

Hearing Yang Kai’s shout, she called back, “Senior Brother Feng, hurry up! If they catch us, we’re dead!”

Her escape technique was strange, seemingly burning her own Origin Qi. The cost was terrifying, but her speed was incredible.

Seeing this, Yang Kai quickly bit his tongue, spat a mouthful of Essence-Blood, and burned it to barely catch up with Yu Ying.

Chang Hao’s group was left standing, dumbfounded.

Just moments ago, Yang Kai had seemed brave and unyielding, and they thought they’d met a tough opponent. But after just one exchange, Yang Kai was sent flying and now burning his Essence-Blood to escape.

“That guy… is just a fancy pillow!” Chang Xian mocked.

“Hmph, lucky he ran fast, or he’d be dead and buried!” Chang Hao grumbled, putting away his hammer Secret Treasure and waving, “Chase them! We must kill them to avenge Junior Brother Deng Yong!”

The others nodded and followed closely behind the two Holy Sons, relentless in their pursuit.

Though Yu Ying and the so-called Feng De were fleeing quickly—one using a secret technique, the other burning Essence-Blood—neither method could last long. Once their time ran out, they’d be weakened.

Killing them then would be easy.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai and Yu Ying were flying through the void, not daring to look back.

Yang Kai burned his Essence-Blood and looked battered, but everything was under control. That bit of Essence-Blood meant nothing to him.

After a while, Yang Kai shouted, “Junior Sister Yu, you have a Soul-Scattering Mark on you. Find a way to get rid of it, or we won’t escape!”

This woman was truly foolish. The two Holy Sons had already mentioned the mark, but even now she hadn’t thought to remove it. If he weren’t involved, he wouldn’t have bothered reminding her.
