## Chapter 776 — Oasis

"I only recovered a little," Yang Kai said with a smile.

Although he had rescued Gou Chi and another demon from the Yang Clan, he never intended to truly befriend someone like Gou Chi.

This rescue was forced by circumstance; he needed to rely on Gou Chi's strength to move freely within the Demon Domain.

So he didn't tell Gou Chi the truth. Subconsciously he still distrusted demons, and he suspected that if Gou Chi didn't hold him in regard, then even having been saved by him would mean little.

"Brother Gou Chi, you said this is the Sand Sea of the Demon Domain? Are you familiar with this place?" Yang Kai asked.

Gou Chi frowned and shook his head. "The Sand Sea is dangerous. Even we demons don't venture in lightly. Here, no matter how great your methods, you might not be able to use them. I only know it's the Sand Sea, not which way to go. Pray—hopefully we find the right direction, avoid major danger, and don't get lost. If we get lost here... we probably won't ever leave."

Hearing this, Yang Kai and An Ling'er's hearts tightened again. Exchanging a glance, they both recognized how wretched their luck had been of late: hunted across the Overseas Archipelago by Saintess Nan, forced to flee into the Void Passage, falling into the Yang Clan's hands and escaping by the skin of their teeth, only to now arrive in the Demon Domain's Sand Sea.

Such a roller-coaster of fate left one feeling helpless.

As they spoke, Yang Kai's brow tightened and he looked toward a direction, calling sharply, "Someone's coming!"

After sensing it, he let out a small sound and looked at Gou Chi strangely. "It's one of your kin."

"Oh?" Gou Chi raised an eyebrow. "So that guy didn't die—he didn't come back all night, I thought he was surely dead out there. He's sure tough to kill."

He said it lightly, showing no care for his companion's life; whether he lived or died meant nothing to him.

Yang Kai's brow tightened slightly.

After a moment, the demon they had rescued from the Small Xuan Realm indeed returned, a look of joy on his face: "I've found the way out!"

Everyone brightened; Gou Chi asked urgently, "Really?"

The man smiled and nodded. "No mistake. I came to the Sand Sea once and found an oasis; I even cut down a tree there, there's still a mark. We're lucky—this is the Sand Sea's outer edge, not deep inside. If we head that way for a few days we'll be out."

He spoke with excitement, visibly elated.

Yang Kai and An Ling'er also let out a light breath; a feeling that their misfortune had reached its limit welled up within them.

Their luck had been rotten enough—if it kept up, Yang Kai thought he might have to find a place to seclude himself for a time.

"Then what are we waiting for? Hurry up, I'm dying of thirst!" Gou Chi waved a large hand and eagerly strode toward that direction.

The other demon led the way without another word.

"Let's go too," Yang Kai said to An Ling'er. She nodded lightly and matched his pace, walking beside him.

The two demons ran ahead in high spirits. An Ling'er glanced at them and quietly said, "Yang Kai, be careful of Gou Chi—don't take him at face value, or you'll suffer."

"As if I needed your warning," Yang Kai chuckled. "I never planned to form a close friendship with him. But since we're in the Demon Domain and need to leave safely, we'll have to rely on him."

An Ling'er nodded and sighed. "Luckily he didn't see much of your true ability in the Small Xuan Realm, otherwise this trip might have been dangerous."

"If he knew your identity we'd be in trouble too," Yang Kai said, his expression darkening. "Don't reveal who you are, and don't use the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's techniques."

"I'm not a careless little girl," An Ling'er smiled.

"Hurry up, Brother Yang, why are you dawdling?" Gou Chi suddenly called back to Yang Kai.

"Coming!" Yang Kai called back. "Move faster."

The demon's ability to find direction was remarkable; in the boundless Sand Sea with no landmarks, he could still find the right way. Especially now that his True Yuan and Divine Sense were sealed and he led purely by instinct and feeling, his skill seemed all the more valuable.

After walking for roughly three hours, a patch of green appeared on the endless Sand Sea.

Oasis!

A miraculous place in the desert where water and plants exist—almost every desert has such spots. No one knows how an oasis forms or how it survives among the sands.

Large oases can remain unchanged for hundreds or thousands of years, offering rest to passing travelers.

To desert travelers, an oasis is often a lifesaving refuge.

Seeing the oasis ahead, the two demons dashed and ran faster.

After a short while, Yang Kai and An Ling'er arrived. Unlike the outside heat, the oasis felt cool and tranquil; towering cacti and poplar-like trees grew there, and a gentle breeze brought comfort.

At the oasis's center glittered a lake; the water was clear like a sweet spring and unfathomably deep, and many strange plants grew along its banks.

When Yang Kai and An Ling'er reached it, they found Gou Chi and the other demon had not entered the water but crouched behind a rock at the shore, holding their breath and peering at the surface with lecherous expressions.

Sensing Yang Kai's arrival, Gou Chi hurriedly shushed them and waved him over with an odd expression.

Yang Kai frowned, not knowing what they were up to. He and An Ling'er crept over and peered past the rock but saw nothing.

"What are you doing?" Yang Kai asked softly.

"Look over there!" Gou Chi whispered, pointing.

Yang Kai and An Ling'er followed the gesture and narrowed their eyes.

On the shore some garments were neatly folded; from their style and color they were undoubtedly a woman's clothes.

The clothes were there but the person was nowhere to be seen—apparently swimming at the bottom of the lake.

Gou Chi and the other demon were clearly hiding to peep at a beauty bathing; Yang Kai realized immediately.

"Perverts!" An Ling'er's cheeks flushed and she hissed, disdain in her eyes. She tugged at Yang Kai and scolded, "Don't go along with them!"

Yang Kai sneered, "I've always kept myself clean; I wouldn't do such filthy things."

Saying that, he glanced a few more times at the lake.

Gou Chi saw Yang Kai's little show and chuckled lecherously, "Brother Yang is one of us after all."

In that moment Gou Chi felt a kinship, finding Yang Kai more agreeable.

Yang Kai said solemnly, "Isn't this a bit improper? If we're discovered..."

"So what if we're discovered? She can't eat me, can she?" Gou Chi snorted, showing no worry.

Although he couldn't use his power now, his status protected him—most demons wouldn't dare strike him; even if caught peeping he didn't care.

"Brother Gou Chi, you don't lack women, why do this?" Yang Kai, sensing something off, urged them to leave.

Gou Chi grinned lecherously, "There are plenty of women, but this is exciting."

The other demon nodded eagerly; both eyes were fixed on the lake, secretly anticipating the moment the swimmer surfaced.

Yang Kai, helpless, gave up arguing.

At that moment bubbles rose on the lake's surface; the two demons' breaths stopped and their eyes widened.

Swish, swish...

A series of slicing sounds erupted as razor-sharp jets of water shot up from beneath the lake.

Everyone's faces changed. Yang Kai and An Ling'er reacted quickly and dodged; Gou Chi and the other demon were not so lucky—pressed close to the rock to get a better look, they couldn't avoid the attack.

With a crash the rock shattered, stone fragments flying. The shards carried brutal force, tearing into Gou Chi and the other demon, who howled and could not open their eyes.

In an instant both were mangled and bloodied.

Yang Kai saw a flash of pale skin shoot up from the lake, and for a moment a graceful figure was visible.

Before he could get a clear look, the figure vanished; his expression turned cold and every pore stood on end.

Once things calmed, Gou Chi swore loudly, "Damn, that bitch dared strike me?"

No sooner had he spoken than a slap sounded; Gou Chi tumbled through the air and crashed down. When he rose his cheek was swollen, eyes full of violent fury as he glared around.

Not far ahead, a newly bathed beauty hovered in midair, her gaze icy as she stared at the four. Her body was full and mature, her long legs straight and perfect. She wore a pale blue palace dress clinging to her wet form, her bosom high and shoulders partly bared; perhaps from just finishing her bath, the cloth clung tightly and outlined her exquisite figure.

Just standing there she was an image of unsurpassed beauty.
