## Chapter 2514 — Fiend Lady

An unyielding determination lingered in Yang Kai's mind, driving him to study that blue stone day and night, forgetting everything else.

At first, Zhang Ruoxi, who lived next door, would come by every few days to check in, wanting to ask when Yang Kai would leave Ziyue City. But as time passed and Yang Kai never appeared, she guessed he must be in seclusion cultivating something, so she didn’t dare disturb him.

With nothing to do in the inn and boredom setting in, she would sometimes leave to wander around the city.

Now that her cultivation had reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, her strength was not low. Although there were some martial artists in Ziyue City with similar power, she was not afraid at all. During her strolls, she soon discovered something novel, and after mustering her courage to try it once, she immediately became fond of it. While Yang Kai was in seclusion studying the stone, she went to that place every day, staying there for a long time before returning to the inn.

In a flash, a month passed.

At a certain moment, Yang Kai took a deep breath, his expression calm as still water, and withdrew his Divine Sense from the stone.

His eyes were bloodshot, as if utterly exhausted and mentally drained, yet his gaze shone as bright as the stars.

After a month of relentless research, Yang Kai finally comprehended all the mysteries hidden within the stone. He personally witnessed Li Wuyi’s growth and gained much from it.

In his mastery of space power, he had taken a great leap forward.

Only now did he realize that all the spatial secret techniques he had previously understood were still imperfect and had much room for improvement. This delighted Yang Kai—improvement meant his spatial secret techniques could become even more powerful, which was exactly what he needed now.

Upon advancing to the Emperor Realm, the enemies he would face would surely become stronger as well. The Power of Space had always been one of his greatest assets, often playing a crucial role.

Crash!

The blue stone in his hand suddenly shattered, turning to powder and slipping through his fingers like flowing sand.

The stone had always been filled with countless space cracks and a black hole. During his research, Yang Kai constantly released his Divine Sense to probe it, and lasting until now was already the limit.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had absorbed all the essence Li Wuyi left in the stone, so even though it broke now, he had no regrets.

Suddenly, Yang Kai slapped his forehead and muttered, “Damn.”

Only now did he realize he’d become so engrossed in the mysteries of space power that he’d forgotten the passage of time and his original purpose for coming here.

After a quick calculation, Yang Kai discovered that his seclusion had unknowingly lasted a whole month.

He hurriedly released his Divine Sense, wanting to call out to Zhang Ruoxi and have her leave Ziyue City with him.

But to his surprise, the room next door was empty.

Only a cup of tea remained on the table, still steaming gently.

Yang Kai’s figure flickered, breaking through space to appear directly in the next room. He reached out to test the temperature of the tea and murmured, “She left less than half a cup of tea ago. Where did that little girl go?”

It was normal for Zhang Ruoxi to go out for a walk after he’d been in seclusion for a month.

And since he was sure she wasn’t in danger, Yang Kai wasn’t too worried.

He released his Divine Sense, instantly enveloping the entire Ziyue City.

It didn’t take long for Yang Kai to spot Zhang Ruoxi’s figure atop a high platform somewhere in the city—a figure moving with surprising agility and grace.

“Hmm…” Yang Kai’s expression grew odd. After thinking for a moment, he casually left some Source Crystals on the table as payment for the inn, then used a spatial secret technique to leave the room.

In the next instant, Yang Kai’s figure appeared beside a platform in Ziyue City known as Rising Dragon Platform.

He appeared without a trace, silent and unnoticed. Aside from a few nearby martial artists who glanced at him curiously, no one paid him any attention.

Even those few martial artists only showed puzzled expressions before quickly looking away.

This arena was built extremely sturdy, with restrictive light screens all around, allowing martial artists to fully unleash themselves during matches.

Arenas like this could be found in many cities. For martial artists, whose cultivation often led to passionate rivalries and the pursuit of strength, clashes were inevitable.

If a conflict happened in the wild, it would be a fierce battle—winner takes all, loser gets nothing.

But in a city, you couldn’t just kill people at will, unless it was a particularly chaotic place.

Every city had its own set of rules—without order, there could be no stability. Though Ziyue City stood on the edge of the desert, it was no exception. If martial artists found themselves in conflict within the city, they could settle their grievances at the arena, signing a life-and-death agreement to determine their fates.

Even without grudges, martial artists could go to the arena to test their skills.

Gradually, these arenas became places for martial artists to pass the time. Here, they could compete with others and improve their combat abilities.

Those not fighting could watch from the surrounding seats and learn from the battles.

When Yang Kai arrived, every seat around the Rising Dragon Platform was packed, and many martial artists without seats floated in the air on their Secret Treasures, all watching the arena intently.

At least ten thousand people had gathered here, all eyes burning as they watched the two martial artists fighting on the arena, exclaiming in admiration and gasping at the dangerous moments.

Ordinary martial artist duels couldn’t attract such a crowd. Only those with great prestige and fame could draw the interest of ten thousand spectators.

At this moment, one of the two fighters on the arena was Zhang Ruoxi.

But unlike her usual gentle and timid demeanor in front of Yang Kai, Zhang Ruoxi now wore a fitted outfit that accentuated her well-developed curves. Her hair was tied back, making her look especially capable.

Her aura was fierce, like a beast released from its cage, her whole body radiating a chilling murderous intent.

Her opponent was a middle-aged man, also at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. No one knew what secret technique he cultivated, but his entire body was shrouded in a blood-red glow, and his presence was formidable.

The two were fighting fiercely on the arena, Origin Qi clashing and producing thunderous booms, causing the restrictive screens to flash wildly.

The girl from the Zhang Family actually came to fight on the arena.

If Yang Kai hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have believed it.

Where did she get the courage? She usually blushes just talking to strangers—how could she dare come to a place like this, under the gaze of ten thousand people?

Moreover, her aura was completely different from usual, which greatly concerned Yang Kai. He knew Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline power was strange, and all her changes were related to it.

As for her opponent, he seemed to be a formidable figure in Ziyue City. Otherwise, how could he attract so many spectators?

Sure enough, as Yang Kai speculated, voices of discussion rose from all directions.

“This match today is truly a clash of dragons and tigers—who knows which side will come out on top in the end!”

“What’s there to doubt? Of course Bloodhand Gu Shan will win. He may not belong to any sect, but he’s been making a name for himself around Ziyue City for fifty years. His reputation and strength here are unmatched—especially in the arena, where he’s never lost a single bout. Every challenger who’s faced him has been defeated. He’s practically the golden signboard of Ziyue City.”

“No sect or faction, yet he’s reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm? Gu Shan is truly remarkable. If he joined a major sect, wouldn’t advancing to the Emperor Realm be just around the corner?”

“Heh, you don’t know. They say Gu Shan once found an ancient cave mansion in the Ziyue Desert and obtained a profound inheritance there, so he doesn’t need to join any sect. A few years ago, an elite disciple from Ahan Palace passed through here. No one knows what happened between him and Gu Shan, but they fought fiercely on the arena. Guess what happened?”

“What?”

“What else? Gu Shan won, of course! He beat that Ahan Palace martial artist so badly he was knocked out of the arena in less than ten moves.”

“Hiss… Gu Shan is that strong? Even disciples of the Ahan Palace aren’t his match?”

Ahan Palace was a top sect in the Eastern Territory, second only to Soul Palace. Martial artists from there were certainly powerful, especially an elite disciple at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

“Of course. He could defeat an elite disciple from the Ahan Palace years ago, and his strength has only grown since. Beating a little girl is no trouble at all. Why do you think so many people came to watch today? Everyone’s here for Gu Shan’s reputation.”

“Little girl?” Another person snorted coldly. “Friend, you sure have a way with words. Would you dare call her a ‘little girl’ to the Fiend Lady’s face? If you do, I’ll call you my ancestor on the spot.”

“Ahem…” The martial artist who favored Gu Shan coughed violently, nearly choking on his tears.

“Fiend Lady?” The man looked at the speaker in confusion. “Is this woman also famous?”

The third person glanced at him and said, “You must be new to Ziyue City?”

The man chuckled, “Just arrived three days ago. I heard there are many opportunities in the Ziyue Desert, so I came to try my luck and happened to catch this event.”

“Three days, no wonder you don’t know.” The third person nodded slightly. “That woman on the arena isn’t simple. Everyone calls her the Fiend Lady, but no one knows her real name.”

“She’s strong?”

“Strong is an understatement!” The third person snorted. “She’s practically invincible! Twenty days ago, she suddenly appeared on the arena and defeated a martial artist of the same level in just three moves, making him cough up blood and faint on the spot. Her methods are swift and ruthless.”

“Th-that was… a complete crush, wasn’t it?”

“Exactly—total domination.”
