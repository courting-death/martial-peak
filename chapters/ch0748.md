## Chapter 748 — Claimed as One's Own

That sacred pill in the jade bottle had been sitting here for who knew how many years; throughout those countless years its pill cloud kept drawing in Heaven-and-Earth Energy to nourish it.

A sacred pill like this was no longer just an ordinary pill; its value was incalculable!

Especially for an alchemist like Yang Kai, it held immense research value; if he could unravel the mystery of how the pill cloud formed, he could one day refine pills born with pill clouds.

Thoughts rapidly intertwined in Yang Kai's mind, and his expression shifted repeatedly.

Inside the jade bottle, the pill cloud around the pill emitted a subtle attraction, drawing in Heaven-and-Earth Energy to flow into it.

Yang Kai suddenly turned his head and coldly glared at the gaunt man.

The other man grinned savagely at Yang Kai; the moment Yang Kai turned, a burst of emerald light sprang from the gaunt man's hand, and in an instant the whole room was enveloped in a poisonous mist.

"Heh heh, you idiot bird, don't blame me for being ruthless," the gaunt man chuckled softly when he saw Yang Kai motionless, wrapped in his poison cloud.

As he spoke, he shaped his fingers into a blade, True Yuan surged, and he thrust straight for Yang Kai's chest.

At that moment he unleashed all his strength, swearing to kill Yang Kai in one blow!

A sacred pill with a pill cloud, and stored for at least a thousand years—such a treasure was not something Yang Kai alone desired; the gaunt man entertained the same thought.

If he could obtain that sacred pill, this trip to the ruins would be a major haul; even if he found nothing else afterward, it would be worth it.

Inside the emerald poison mist his face wore a fervent, feral expression.

With a metallic clang...

Yang Kai had not moved, yet a spark leapt from his chest; his skin remained unbroken as he continued to stare coldly at the other man.

The grin on the gaunt man's face evaporated; surprise filled his eyes, then his features contorted.

The strike he had just used was a full-force blow, but not only had it failed to kill Yang Kai, his finger had been fractured—when it struck Yang Kai it had felt like hitting refined steel; the other's body was absurdly hard.

"Idiot!" Yang Kai said lightly as he smoothed his chest and flattened the crease in his clothing. "If you hadn't attacked there'd be no reason for me to kill you; you've come looking for your own death, friend!"

"How... my Bone-Corroding Poison Smoke can't even be withstood by a Transcendent Realm cultivator—how could you possibly remain unharmed?" the gaunt man's eyes trembled violently, terror flooding his mind.

"Nothing is impossible." Yang Kai smiled contemptuously. Seeing the man try to flee, he flicked and blocked his path; a palm-blade struck the man's throat.

The gaunt man's eyes bulged, both hands clutched his neck, gasps escaped his throat but not a single word could be formed; a few staggering steps later he collapsed and died.

A martial artist at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm—Yang Kai could dispose of him with astonishing ease.

Before the man died, Yang Kai had already snatched up the remaining jade bottles, hastily checked them, and after confirming none contained a pill with a pill cloud, he burst out of the room.

"What's wrong? What happened in there?" Three warriors from outside rushed in and collided with Yang Kai, urgently asking.

Though Yang Kai's confrontation with the gaunt man had been extremely discreet, the sudden surge of True Yuan had alerted them; of course they had come to investigate.

"Run—some formation inside was triggered!" Yang Kai shouted, face ashen.

The three glanced behind Yang Kai; seeing the room filled with emerald poison mist, their expressions turned grave and they did not dare to venture in, instead hastening to follow Yang Kai out.

"What happened in there?" Hai Wangu asked as he saw the four of them hurry out, his own face uneasy.

"There was a formation in that room; when I and that fellow were inspecting it he accidentally triggered it," Yang Kai explained quickly, his complexion shifting between shades of green and blue.

"Where is he?" Hai Wangu's expression changed.

"Dead."

"Dead?" The crowd was instantly horrified.

They had been here for over half a day and had encountered no danger; they had assumed the ancient ruins were completely safe, so now that someone had died for no clear reason they felt uneasy.

"How are you unharmed?" Hai Wangu's eyes glittered as he scrutinized Yang Kai and asked in a low voice.

"I was standing a bit farther away; but it seems I was poisoned too..." Yang Kai coughed weakly, his face rapidly shifting between ashen hues.

At that remark everyone instinctively distanced themselves, as if afraid of being implicated.

Yang Kai observed them inwardly and his heart sank with relief.

Before the gaunt man struck, he had released a cloud of poison—no doubt he had prepared his story in advance, so that he could claim the same explanation when questioned by others.

Yang Kai had merely borrowed that explanation to account for the man's death.

The room was still thick with poison mist, so no one would bother to search it closely; and because Yang Kai had purposely inhaled a little of the mist, his claim seemed all the more convincing.

"There must be a formation inside..." Hai Wangu murmured, then his gaze turned keenly to Yang Kai. "Did you find anything?"

"Only these jade bottles. I grabbed them before we left," Yang Kai said, handing the bottles over to Hai Wangu.

Disappointment showed on everyone's faces.

They had found many jade bottles along the way, but never anything useful inside.

Hai Wangu's face hardened; he regarded Yang Kai with some distrust.

They had encountered no formations on the rest of their journey, yet here was one—this suggested the room likely contained something valuable; why else would the previous owner set up a formation?

"You didn't hide anything, did you?" Hai Wangu narrowed his eyes at Yang Kai and asked sternly.

Yang Kai gave a rueful smile. "I don't have a Spatial Pouch—if I got anything, where could I hide it?"

Hai Wangu swept his Divine Sense over Yang Kai and, after confirming his words, nodded slightly.

A Spatial Pouch was an extremely convenient storage Secret Treasure, but on the Tongxuan Continent not everyone had one.

Back in the Duao Alliance, only a few team leaders were qualified to carry Spatial Pouches; among the warriors from the Seven Families Alliance who went into the sea this time, the vast majority didn't possess such storage treasures.

"Do you distrust me, senior?" Yang Kai shot Hai Wangu a cold glance.

Hai Wangu waved it off lightly. "Just a routine question, little brother—don't mind it."

Saying that, he stopped giving Yang Kai any more attention and, with some reluctance, opened the jade bottles.

He hadn't expected to find anything, but when he opened one bottle his face stiffened in disbelief; he peered more closely into one of the bottles.

At the same time, a pleasant medicinal fragrance reached the others' noses.

"Huh?" Hai Wangu exclaimed, dumping the pills from the bottle—there were about a dozen, most reduced to worthless fragments, but among them were two pills that looked different from the rest.

These two pills bore pill patterns, brimming with Spiritual Qi; because of their pill patterns they had not lost efficacy and remained intact.

"Spirit-Grade Pills!" Hai Wangu cried out.

Everyone was electrified, eyes burning as they looked at what Hai Wangu held, joy flashing in their gazes.

These two pills were not only Spirit-Grade but also bore pill patterns—pills with pill patterns were worth several times more than ordinary Spirit-Grade Pills.

Yang Kai stood aside, watching the others' expressions with indifference.

He had inspected the bottles earlier and knew what was inside, but he hadn't taken anything.

To him, Spirit-Grade pills with pill patterns weren't of great value—he could refine such pills himself; only the sacred pill with the pill cloud was worth seizing.

Tossing out those jade bottles had indeed drawn everyone's attention, ensuring none were watching him.

Hai Wangu's old hands trembled as he hurriedly opened other bottles; sure enough, they found more pills with pill patterns.

Some were Spirit-Grade, some were Mystery-Grade, and they were perfectly preserved!

"There really are good things in that room," Hai Wangu kept nodding, laughing heartily; the Seven Families Alliance were small houses who couldn't afford top-tier alchemists, so obtaining a few pills with pill patterns made him happier than anything.

"If any of you find more jade bottles later, don't ignore them—there might be more of these pills inside!" Hai Wangu admonished as he put the finds away.

Everyone nodded eagerly; they had never before considered the possibility of pill patterns until now.

"Little brother, you've done well!" Some outsiders patted Yang Kai on the shoulder warmly and praised him.

No one mentioned the dead gaunt man.

They were all strangers to one another—whether he died or not, no one would mourn him.

Yang Kai kept coughing, his expression pained and melancholy. "It's a pity the friend who went in with me couldn't come out..."

Hai Wangu glanced at him; though unconvinced inwardly, he said aloud, "Don't worry, little brother—when we return he won't miss out on his share. If we can find his family I'll be sure to send his portion to them. But for now, take this antidote pill—our Hai Family's chief alchemist made it; it should help your injuries."

With the haul, Hai Wangu not only stopped suspecting Yang Kai but even showed concern, handing him a pill as he spoke.

"Thank you!" Yang Kai took it, checked it briefly to confirm it was an antidote and hadn't been tampered with, then popped it into his mouth, sat cross-legged, and pretended to cultivate while saying, "You go on ahead; I will follow shortly."
