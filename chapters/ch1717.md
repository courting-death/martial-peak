## Chapter 1717 — Conditions

After a long silence, Sha Hu seemed to gradually digest the information, then asked more carefully about Yang Kai.

Pang Zhen recounted, one by one, all the intelligence he knew.

Sha Hu's expression grew ever graver; Qian Mo and Shang Ao's faces flickered as their eyes met, as if silently exchanging thoughts.

At that moment, an unusual movement came from the mountain hollow, and then a figure walked out.

It was Yang Kai.

Shang Ao, Qian Mo, and Pang Zhen all started, clasping their fists in salute. Sha Hu smiled slightly and asked, "Any gains?"

Yang Kai returned their salute, then put away the Stone Puppet and Liu Yan before nodding, "A little."

"So you can use Saint Yuan now?" Sha Hu asked in surprise.

That day, during the battle with Ming Yue, the opponent had suddenly used Saint Yuan and the power of Shi, which had indeed startled Sha Hu; he had puzzled over it afterward and could only blame the secret hidden in that mountain hollow.

The depths of that hollow were precisely the place he had told Yang Kai about before, a place even he could not probe.

There must be some secrets hidden there, perhaps related to why Ming Yue could use Saint Yuan — Sha Hu simply could not understand the cause. Now seeing Yang Kai with a look of having gained something, he immediately formed a guess.

"Using Saint Yuan is no problem." Yang Kai nodded calmly, not showing the elation Sha Hu had imagined, and then added, "I also found a way to leave here."

"What?" Sha Hu cried out in shock.

Pang Zhen and the others were momentarily stunned, then all looked toward Yang Kai with delight and asked eagerly, "Is that true?"

"Of course." Yang Kai nodded. "I came out to tell you this. If any of you want to leave with me, prepare yourselves — in a few days I'll be leaving."

"Sect Master Yang…" Pang Zhen stammered, looking at Yang Kai. "May I ask, Sect Master, how many people can you take out?"

Shang Ao, hearing Pang Zhen's question, quickly realized and asked the same.

"I can take everyone out." Yang Kai replied. "However…"

"However what?" Pang Zhen immediately tensed.

"I can take the people of Sea Hall and Sea God Palace out free of charge. As for the others… hm, tell them that if anyone wants to leave this place, help me find some Huntian Lotuses."

Pang Zhen was taken aback for a moment, then understood and smiled wryly, "Sect Master Yang, you have thought this through!"

It was easy to imagine: once the news spread, those trapped on Ghost Isle would strive to find Huntian Lotus in order to secure a slot to leave. Yang Kai would inevitably become the greatest beneficiary.

Yang Kai chuckled, "I'm only charging a small fee."

"When do you plan to leave?" Sha Hu asked from the side.

"In one month."

"Good!" Sha Hu agreed. "I will help you spread the word. As for the warriors of Sea Hall, I won't let your efforts be in vain — once we leave here, Sea Hall will offer a gift of thanks."

"If Elder Sha insists, then I won't refuse." Yang Kai laughed heartily.

"Sea God Palace will not let Sect Master Yang work for nothing either," Shang Ao quickly added.

Yang Kai glanced at him, nodding faintly without saying more.

News that one could leave Ghost Isle spread like a sudden gale and soon swept the entire isle.

Upon hearing it, ninety-nine percent of the warriors refused to believe it, thinking it a joke — after all, if there had been a way to leave Ghost Isle, they would not have been trapped here so long. Over the years countless warriors had fallen here, including many prodigies; surely someone would have discovered a way out.

In truth, Ghost Isle was a prison that had trapped everyone here to death.

So a sudden claim like this was hard to trust.

Only when Sha Hu stepped forward to clarify and vouched for it did the isle's warriors accept the news as true.

In an instant, almost all the warriors on Ghost Isle mobilized, forming groups and heading into the surrounding sea regions to search for Huntian Lotus, hoping to secure a place to depart.

Ghost Isle became, in a very short time, an empty island.

Ten thousand li away from Ghost Isle, Yang Kai stood on the back of the Little Dolphin and headed forward across the sea.

While Ghost Isle's warriors scattered to seek Huntian Lotus, he had been busy as well; such precious Huntian Lotus were better gathered in quantity, so after instructing Sha Hu to spread the news he had left the isle with Little Dolphin, roaming distant seas and relying on the dolphin's instincts to find the precious lotuses.

He had harvested a great deal.

The far seas were places the island's warriors seldom reached, so the Huntian Lotus there were naturally more abundant than in near waters.

After tempering his body with several hundred Origin-Grade Huntian Pills, Yang Kai’s physique had grown several times stronger than when he had first entered Ghost Isle. The sea beasts that had once seemed formidable now couldn’t withstand even a single blow from him.

He and Little Dolphin traveled farther and farther, and his harvest grew ever richer.

When he judged the time was right, he told Little Dolphin to return.

By the time he returned to Ghost Isle, thousands of warriors were already waiting respectfully.

One month was not long enough for everyone to find sufficient Huntian Lotus; some had been unlucky and seen none, and now they waited anxiously, fearing Yang Kai would leave without them.

After meeting with Sha Hu and the others to learn the situation, Yang Kai had the warriors of Sea Hall and Sea God Palace help him collect the Huntian Lotus.

Those who had gathered Huntian Lotus happily handed over what they had collected during the month and then stepped aside to wait for the moment of departure.

It took only a single day to settle everything.

The island's residents were divided into two groups: those who had handed over Huntian Lotus, and those who had not.

The number who had not handed over Huntian Lotus was not large — only seven or eight hundred.

Yang Kai stood before those seven or eight hundred, seeing anxiety, unease, and embarrassment on their faces; he smiled slightly and announced in a clear voice, "Don't say Yang denies you opportunity. Since you have no Huntian Lotus, you must redeem your freedom in another way."

"Young Brother, may I ask what manner of way that is?" an older-looking warrior in the crowd asked.

The others watched Yang Kai with curiosity, fearful he might demand something harsh.

"Some of you may be influential, may have high status on Dark Star, and certainly have relatives and sects there. After leaving here, if you can pay the appropriate price, I can take you away. If you cannot even afford that, then be slaves for ten years — within those ten years your lives are mine; I will have you do what I wish."

At that pronouncement the crowd stirred; some worried, but more wore looks of joy.

Yang Kai was right: the vast majority of these people still had relatives and sects on Dark Star. Once they left here, gathering some supplies would not be difficult.

Exchanging those supplies for their freedom was not a bad bargain.

If they could not even raise such supplies, being slaves for ten years was not a great disaster; Yang Kai did not look like a villain, otherwise he would have simply abandoned them on Ghost Isle.

After ten years they would regain their freedom.

"Those willing should go to the Island Lord Sha and leave your soul imprint; when you have fulfilled your agreement, I will return the soul imprint," Yang Kai shouted.

In the next moment, more than half of those seven or eight hundred surged toward where Sha Hu stood; the rest hesitated a while and then resignedly followed.

Sha Hu, having been instructed beforehand by Yang Kai, had already arranged for Sea Hall disciples to be ready; as those warriors came forward, they produced white spirit jades and had them inscribe each warrior's soul imprint.

With those soul imprints, anyone could easily control the lives of those warriors; no one would dare ignore the agreement today.

Sha Hu pushed through the crowd to Yang Kai's side, watching the commotion and smiling wryly, "Does Sect Master Yang's Lingxiao Sect lack such supplies?"

Yang Kai chuckled, "Mosquito meat is still meat."

Sha Hu regarded him thoughtfully, chuckling and saying no more.

He seemed to have seen through Yang Kai's intent.

Yang Kai plainly intended to bring all the warriors of Ghost Isle out, which was why he had set such a modest condition.

His motive was twofold: to use the island's warriors to help him gather Huntian Lotus, and to treat everyone fairly so he would not be criticized.

The only explanation for this was that he could return to Ghost Isle at will; he had already treated this place as his private garden, so he wanted to take everyone away.

Thinking this, Sha Hu's breath quickened slightly.

Not to mention the number of Huntian Lotus Yang Kai had gathered in recent days — in the future, whenever he wished, he could probably come here at will to collect more.

One could imagine how terrifying Lingxiao Sect would become with time and growth.

What thoughts ran through Sha Hu’s mind, Yang Kai did not know — but the old man was shrewd, and Yang Kai believed that Sha Hu had likely guessed his intentions, at least vaguely.

He had no intention to explain; having learned the method to leave, he had both the right and the ability to do so.

He only wished to make this place his forbidden land.

The matter of those seven or eight hundred was settled in the time it took an incense stick to burn, and the island's warriors all assembled.

Every eye turned to Yang Kai, wanting to know how he would take them away; hope and apprehension shone on each face.

Even Sha Hu and the others were like that.

Although Yang Kai had spoken with certainty before and none doubted him, now that the moment had come they could not help but grow nervous.
